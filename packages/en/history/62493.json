Within these two centuries the\r\npolitical and social conditions of the so-called Middle Ages came to an\r\nend, and the states system of Modern Europe took its rise. But the\r\nimportance of the period is more than equalled by the almost superhuman\r\ndifficulty of narrating its events in anything like orderly and\r\nintelligible sequence. Such unity as had been given to Western Europe by\r\nthe mediæval Empire and Papacy disappeared with the Great Interregnum in\r\nthe middle of the thirteenth century; and such unity as was afterwards\r\nsupplied by the growth of formal international relations cannot be said\r\nto begin before the invasion of Naples by Charles VIII. of France at the\r\nend of the fifteenth century. In the interval between these two dates\r\nthere is apparent chaos, and only the closest attention can detect the\r\ngerms of future order in the midst of the struggle of dying and nascent\r\nforces. It is easy to find evidence of astounding intellectual activity\r\nand instances of brilliant political and military achievement, but the\r\ndominant characteristic of the age is its diversity, and it is hard to\r\nfind any principle of co-ordination. A cursory glance over some of the\r\nmost striking episodes of the period will serve to illustrate the\r\nmultiplicity of its interests. The hundred years’ war between England\r\nand France; the rise and fall of the House of Burgundy; the struggle of\r\nold and new conceptions of ecclesiastical polity in the Papal schism, in\r\nthe Councils of Constance and Basel, and in the Hussite movement; the\r\nmarvellous achievements of the republic of Venice, and of Florence under\r\nboth republican and Medicean rule; the revival of art and letters, not\r\nonly in one or two great centres, but in numerous petty states which\r\nwould otherwise be wholly obscure; the growth and decline of unique\r\ncorporations, such as the Hanseatic League and the Teutonic Order; the\r\nextension and gradual union of the Christian states of Spain at the\r\nexpense of Mohammedanism, and at the same time the gloomy story of the\r\nconquest of the Eastern Empire by the Turks;—all these episodes might\r\nwell be treated in a volume apiece, but it is difficult to arrange them\r\nwithin the compass of a book which should deal with the general\r\ndevelopment of Europe. No doubt it may be held that some of these events\r\nare of more permanent importance than others, and that the essential\r\nfact to grasp in the period is the rise of great and coherent states\r\nlike France, Spain, and England. But it is equally true that the\r\nimportant events are unintelligible without some knowledge of the less\r\nimportant events with which they are connected; that in this period\r\nGermany and Italy are more prominent than Spain and England, or even\r\nthan France; and that Germany and Italy are not coherent states at all.\r\nThe former is a bundle of states, and the latter can hardly be said to\r\nbe as much. And it may be urged with some force that German history in\r\nthe fourteenth century cannot be studied without some attention being\r\npaid to Poland, Hungary, and Denmark; that the history of Venice and\r\nFlorence cannot be isolated from that of Genoa and Pisa; and that even\r\nin tracing the growth of states which achieved some measure of unity it\r\nis necessary to note the absorption of the formerly distinct and\r\nindependent provinces.\r\n\r\nI have stated the difficulty, which is indeed sufficiently obvious, but\r\nI cannot claim to have found a thoroughly satisfactory solution. My\r\nendeavour has been to make the narrative as clear and intelligible as\r\nthe conflicting needs of conciseness and of frequent transitions will\r\nadmit. I may perhaps point out to my readers that in an age in which\r\ndynastic interests and claims become of greater and greater importance,\r\nin which royal marriages are a prominent factor in international\r\npolitics and vitally affect the growth of the greatest states, a careful\r\nstudy of genealogy is imperatively necessary. This will explain and\r\njustify the insertion of a number of genealogical tables in the\r\nAppendix, which the student of the period may find not the least useful\r\npart of the volume.\r\n\r\nR.

The universal authority of the Emperor\r\ncould hardly fail to become shadowy and unreal, but it was rendered more\r\ndistasteful to non-German princes and peoples by the immediate\r\nassociation of the Empire with a distinct kingdom, with which they might\r\nhave causes of quarrel. And as the Empire became more and more\r\nlocalised, so the German kingship became steadily weaker. The shadowy\r\ncharacter of the higher dignity tended to produce the same impression as\r\nto the more real and practical office. The princes who held their lands\r\nof the German king aimed more and more at the independence of the\r\nexternal kings and rulers, who, in feudal theory, held of the Emperor.\r\nThe imperial claims brought the Empire into collision with the Papacy,\r\nand the German monarchy suffered from the blows which the Emperor’s\r\npower received in the great Contest of Investitures. Moreover, the\r\nEmpire carried with it the crown of Italy; and the constant waste of\r\nmoney and men in the vain attempt to establish a real dominion in the\r\nsouthern peninsula, not only weakened individual German rulers, but also\r\nled to constant absences from Germany which gave occasion to their\r\nnorthern vassals to acquire independence. Above all the Empire was, by\r\ntradition and by the very conception of the office, elective. Thus the\r\nGerman kings were deprived of all the advantages which normal hereditary\r\nsuccession gave to the rulers of England and France. Not only did\r\ndisputed elections give rise to civil war with all its evils, but the\r\nconstant change from one family to another rendered impossible any\r\nconsistent policy of strengthening the central power. When at last the\r\nHapsburgs obtained quasi-hereditary possession of the imperial dignity,\r\ndisunion had made such progress that it was too late to apply a remedy.\r\n\r\nThe decline of the central power and the consequent rise [Sidenote:\r\nGerman divisions.] of a large number of semi-independent political\r\nunits, each with a separate existence of its own, though held together\r\nby certain common duties and interests, make German history in this\r\nperiod peculiarly difficult and complicated. And the number of these\r\nunits was far greater in the thirteenth century than would have seemed\r\nlikely at an earlier date. The great duchies formed by the Karolings\r\nhad, by the policy of subsequent rulers, been broken up or allowed to\r\nbecome extinct. The great duchy of Swabia, for instance, came to an end\r\nwith the Hohenstaufen, and was never revived. But the extinction of each\r\nduchy brought with it an immense increase of the number of\r\ntenants-in-chief. Every noble, town, and even village which had\r\npreviously held of the duke, now claimed to hold directly of the\r\nEmperor; and though many of the weaker units fell victims to the greed\r\nof powerful neighbours, yet some, like the original members of the Swiss\r\nConfederation, succeeded in retaining the coveted position. In Germany,\r\ntoo, primogeniture was in those days a rare exception, and the practice\r\nof equal partition among brothers necessarily led to a great increase in\r\nthe number of princely tenants of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, impossible in this volume to attempt to [Sidenote: The\r\nlay princes.] trace the separate history of the various principalities\r\nand states which fill the rather ill-defined territory known as Germany.\r\nBut it is necessary at starting to have a clear conception of some of\r\nthe chief families which play so important a part in subsequent history.\r\nThe four most prominent princely houses in the middle of the thirteenth\r\ncentury were those of Ascania, Welf, Wittelsbach, and Wettin. The first\r\nwas sub-divided into two lines, descended from the two sons of Albert\r\nthe Bear. The elder son had held the marks of Brandenburg in the north,\r\nwhich, since 1267, were split up among several brothers. The younger\r\nson, Bernard, had in 1180 received from Frederick Barbarossa the\r\ndiminished duchy of Saxony, which was now held by his grandson, Albert\r\nII. (1261-1298). The great family of Welf, so powerful in the previous\r\ncentury, was now confined to the duchy of Brunswick, afterwards\r\nsub-divided into Lüneburg (Hanover) and Wolfenbüttel (Brunswick). The\r\nHouse of Wittelsbach was represented by two brothers, Lewis II., who\r\ncombined the duchy of Upper Bavaria with the Palatine county\r\n(_Pfalzgrafschaft_) of the Rhine, and Henry, who held the duchy of Lower\r\nBavaria. Henry of Wettin, whose descendants acquired Saxony in the\r\nfifteenth century and retain it to the present day, was at this time\r\nMargrave of Meissen and Landgrave of Thuringia. But the most powerful\r\nindividual prince at this time was Ottokar, ruler of the Slav kingdom of\r\nBohemia, which was brought by geography and history into close\r\nconnection with Germany. To Bohemia, which he inherited in 1253 from his\r\nfather, Wenzel I., Ottokar had added by marriage and diplomacy Austria,\r\nStyria, Carinthia, and Carniola, and thus held a secure predominance in\r\nsouth-eastern Germany. There were also three lesser families, as yet\r\ninsignificant, and not regarded as belonging to the princely class,\r\nwhich were destined within this period to rise to importance in Germany,\r\nwhile two of them have taken a position among the greatest dynasties\r\nEurope has ever seen. The House of Luxemburg, in the thirteenth century\r\nthe lords of a petty county near the western frontier, produced in the\r\nnext century four Emperors, and founded a territorial power which\r\nsurvived the family which had created it. The Hapsburgs, hitherto known\r\nonly as active and successful nobles in Swabia, within this period built\r\nup a considerable state in south-eastern Germany, and succeeded to the\r\nposition which the Luxemburgs had founded. Finally, the Hohenzollerns,\r\nwho in the thirteenth century combined scattered territories in\r\nFranconia with the office of Burggraf of Nürnberg, acquired the\r\nelectorate of Brandenburg in the fifteenth century, and though their\r\npower grew more slowly than that of the Luxemburgs and Hapsburgs, yet it\r\nrested on a surer foundation, owed more to ability and policy than to\r\nfortune, and may prove in the end both more brilliant and more durable.\r\n\r\nAmong the great territorial princes of Germany must be [Sidenote: The\r\nBishops.] reckoned the very numerous ecclesiastical tenants-in-chief of\r\nthe Empire. A large area of German soil, especially along the valleys of\r\nthe Rhine and the Main, was held by bishops and monasteries. Of these\r\nclerical princes the most powerful and prominent were the Rhenish\r\narchbishops of Mainz, Köln, and Trier. In former times the bishops had\r\nbeen severed from the secular princes by class interests and traditions,\r\nand the separation had been encouraged by many of the Emperors, whose\r\npolicy was to exalt themselves by playing one off against the other. But\r\nafter the middle of the thirteenth century this distinction tends to\r\nbecome obscured. The rivalry between Emperors and Popes, though it does\r\nnot disappear, ceases to be the dominant factor in German relations; and\r\nduring the papal residence in Avignon (1305-1376) the German bishops\r\nbecome to some extent alienated from the Papacy. The result is that the\r\nGerman princes, both clerical and secular, come to form a fairly united\r\nclass; and the most obvious interest which binds them together is the\r\ndesire to strengthen their own independence, their ‘liberty,’ as they\r\ncall it, by weakening the central power. On the other hand, the lesser\r\ntenants-in-chief below the princely rank, known in later history as the\r\n_Ritterschaft_, or knights, are impelled to cling to the monarchy for\r\nsupport against the constant danger of princely encroachments.\r\n\r\nBesides the princes and knights, there is a very important [Sidenote:\r\nThe imperial cities.] body of tenants-in-chief—the _Reichstädte_, or\r\nimperial cities. These had risen to importance, partly through the\r\neconomic conditions which gave them wealth, and partly through the\r\npolicy of several of the Emperors, who had encouraged the growth of\r\nmunicipal life as a source of revenue and as a check upon the power of\r\nthe princes. German cities may be divided roughly into two great groups:\r\nthose in the south, like Augsburg, Nürnberg, Ratisbon, etc., which\r\nobtained importance from their position on the great commercial routes\r\nleading from Venice and Genoa to different parts of Europe; and those in\r\nthe north, on the Baltic and the German Ocean, whose function was to\r\ncarry on the trade between the east and the west of Northern Europe, and\r\nto exchange at Bruges the products of the north for the commodities\r\nbrought by the southern merchants (see p. 422). The strength of the\r\ntowns lay in their wealth and their walls; their weakness in their\r\nisolation and mutual jealousy. This weakness the southern cities never\r\novercame; their leagues for common objects were never durable, and\r\ntherefore never effectual. But the northern towns were left more to\r\nthemselves: they came into contact with less developed states, and they\r\nwere subject to the pressure of more constant and more immediate\r\npolitical interests. The necessity of securing trade privileges in the\r\ncountries lying to the east and west of the Baltic, and the duty of\r\ndefending their commercial routes against the aggressive Scandinavian\r\nstate of Denmark, which commanded the outlets from the Baltic, forced\r\nthe northern towns into a semi-federal union, and the Hanseatic League\r\nbecame for a time a great political power in the north. In the end the\r\nnorthern cities also succumbed, owing mainly to a great change in trade\r\nroutes, and partly to the growing predominance of the princes. But at\r\nthe beginning of this period the future destiny of the German towns was\r\nunknown, and to contemporaries it seemed quite possible that cities like\r\nNürnberg and Augsburg, or Lübeck and Hamburg, might obtain an\r\nindependence and a power not markedly inferior to that which was\r\nactually acquired at this time by Venice and Florence, which were in\r\ntheory equally tenants-in-chief of the Empire, though further removed\r\nfrom the exercise of imperial authority.\r\n\r\nThe decline of the German kingship had begun in the [Sidenote: The\r\nInterregnum and its results.] eleventh century, but a partial revival\r\nhad been effected by the great Hohenstaufen Emperors, Frederick\r\nBarbarossa, Henry VI., and Frederick II. With the fall of the\r\nHohenstaufen both Empire and monarchy sank lower than they had ever done\r\nbefore. During the Great Interregnum (1256-1273), two rival kings, the\r\nEnglishman Richard of Cornwall, and the Castilian king, Alfonso X., had\r\nsecured the nominal adherence of conflicting parties in Germany, but\r\nneither had attempted to rule the country. In these years not only did\r\nthe tenants-in-chief enjoy complete independence of any external\r\nauthority, but the imperial domains were either annexed by the princes,\r\nor squandered by the two royal claimants in the attempt to purchase\r\nadherents. This rendered it impossible to revive the old monarchy, and\r\nproduced changes which seemed to render German unity for ever hopeless.\r\nHitherto the elected Emperor had resigned his hereditary dominions, and\r\nhad supported himself on the domain-lands, travelling about from one\r\nestate to another. This was no longer possible. The only way in which a\r\nfuture king could hope to secure any respect or obedience was to acquire\r\nsuch a territorial power as would make him formidable. Such a policy,\r\nconsistently pursued by a line of hereditary kings, might have resulted\r\nin the gradual formation of a territorial monarchy like that of France.\r\nBut the princes made use of their right of election, at first to prevent\r\nthe kingship passing to successive members of the same family, and\r\nalways to impose conditions which should secure their own independence.\r\nThe evil results became abundantly plain in the century which followed\r\nthe Interregnum. Each successive Emperor set himself, not so much to\r\nstrengthen the monarchy, as to aggrandise his own family; and the more\r\nsuccessful he was, the more dangerous and objectionable did that family\r\nbecome to his successor. The same conditions which produced nepotism in\r\nthe Papacy, led to the adoption of a consistent policy of dynastic\r\naggrandisement by all the Emperors from Rudolf of Hapsburg onwards.\r\n\r\nIn 1272 the death of Richard of Cornwall forced his [Sidenote: Election\r\nof Rudolf I.] adherents to consider the question of a new election, and\r\nat the same time Pope Gregory X., alarmed by the excessive power of the\r\nHouse of Anjou in Italy, and afraid lest German disunion might give\r\noccasion for French aggression north of the Alps, used all his influence\r\nto urge on the unanimous choice of a new king in Germany. For a long\r\ntime the right of election had tended to fall into fewer hands. The\r\nearly German kings were selected by the chief men and approved by the\r\nacclamations of a mass meeting of all freemen. Gradually the form of\r\npopular approval disappeared, and the princely tenants-in-chief assumed\r\nan absolute power of nomination. Since then the practice had grown up of\r\na preliminary choice by some of the chief princes, to be ratified by the\r\nrest. But in the thirteenth century the idea arose that certain princes\r\ncould elect without any further ceremony. Superstition and custom seem\r\nto have combined to suggest the number seven for these electors, as they\r\ncame to be called. But there were several contending claimants for the\r\nright to be included in the favoured seven, and it was not till the next\r\ncentury that these disputes were finally settled. On the present\r\noccasion the lead was taken by the great Rhenish princes, the Count\r\nPalatine with the three Archbishops. The only chance of securing a\r\ngeneral adhesion of the princes was to choose a king who was not so\r\nstrong as to excite either fear or jealousy. Mainly through the\r\nexertions of Frederick III. of Hohenzollern, Burggraf of Nürnberg, the\r\nchoice of the electors fell upon his cousin Rudolf, Count of Hapsburg,\r\nwho was crowned at Aachen on October 24, 1273. It is not a little\r\ncurious that the election of the first Hapsburg was brought about by the\r\ninfluence of a Hohenzollern.\r\n\r\nRudolf’s position was no easy one when, at the age of [Sidenote:\r\nRudolf’s policy.] fifty-five, he was called from his successful career\r\nin the petty politics of Swabia[1] to assume the German kingship. He had\r\na large family of daughters, whose marriages served to gain him\r\nadherents. At the coronation ceremony one had been married to Lewis of\r\nWittelsbach, and another to Albert of Saxony. But such a tie was\r\ninsufficient to secure the docile obedience of his sons-in-law if he\r\nendeavoured to exercise any real authority over them. Alfonso of Castile\r\nretained the title of king of the Romans, and though for the time he was\r\npowerless, his pretensions might easily serve as a pretext for\r\nmalcontents. A more formidable opponent was Ottokar of Bohemia, whose\r\nclaim to a voice in the election had been disregarded, and who refused\r\nto acknowledge the ‘pauper count’ of Hapsburg. In these circumstances\r\nRudolf showed all the prudence and foresight that had already won him a\r\nreputation. He realised that it was no longer possible to revive the\r\npretensions of the Hohenstaufen. He could not afford to alienate the\r\nPope or to aim at the recovery of an Italian kingdom. He must content\r\nhimself with obtaining what reality he could for the royal power in\r\nGermany, and must find a territorial basis for that power. The most\r\nobvious method of doing this was the restoration of the duchy of Swabia\r\nin his own family, which would enable him to achieve the aims which he\r\nhad hitherto pursued. But such a step would involve a quarrel with Lewis\r\nof Wittelsbach, who claimed to be regarded the heir of the Hohenstaufen.\r\nRudolf could not venture on such a risk, and he fell back on the plan of\r\nwresting from Ottokar the German fiefs in the south-east, which the\r\nlatter had seized during the Interregnum. Before attempting this, Rudolf\r\nhad to gain over the Pope, the close ally of the Bohemian king. Through\r\nthe agency of Frederick of Hohenzollern he concluded a concordat with\r\nGregory X., by which he confirmed all previous concessions of Italian\r\nterritory to the Papacy, and recognised the Angevin kingdom of Naples\r\nand Sicily. These promises were subsequently confirmed in a personal\r\ninterview with Gregory at Lausanne (October, 1275). In March 1280 Rudolf\r\nmade a direct treaty with Charles of Anjou, by which he confirmed his\r\npossession of Provence, and agreed to marry his daughter Clementia to\r\nCharles’s grandson. Thus the policy of Frederick II. was finally\r\nabandoned. To secure undisturbed freedom of action in Germany, Rudolf\r\nresigned Italy to the Pope and the House of Anjou.\r\n\r\nRudolf’s alliance with the Pope made him strong enough [Sidenote: War\r\nwith Ottokar.] to take active measures against Ottokar, whose refusal to\r\nrecognise the election on the ground that his vote had been rejected\r\nirritated the German princes. At successive diets, in 1274 and 1275, he\r\nwas summoned to justify his occupation of Austria, Styria, Carinthia,\r\nand Carniola, and on his refusal was called upon to resign these fiefs.\r\nIn 1276 Rudolf collected an imperial army and advanced into Austria,\r\nwhere he was welcomed by a general rising of the German nobles against\r\nSlav rule. Vienna capitulated, and Ottokar, finding resistance hopeless,\r\nmade peace on November 21. On condition that Bohemia and Moravia should\r\nbe secured to him, he resigned the German provinces. The treaty was to\r\nbe confirmed by a double marriage of his daughter to Rudolf’s son\r\nHartmann, and of his son Wenzel to one of Rudolf’s numerous daughters.\r\nRudolf was so confident in the results of his victory, that he hastened\r\nto disband his army. But Ottokar had no intention of carrying out the\r\ntreaty of Vienna, and he succeeded in gaining over many of the chief\r\nGerman princes by representing the danger of allowing a strong Hapsburg\r\npower to be established on the Danube. The result was a renewal of the\r\nstruggle in 1278 under widely altered conditions. The death of Gregory\r\nX. (1276) had deprived Rudolf of much of the advantage gained by his\r\nconcordat with the Papacy. The Archbishops of Mainz and Köln turned\r\nagainst him. Lewis of Wittelsbach remained obstinately neutral. Henry of\r\nLower Bavaria, whom Rudolf had gained over in 1276 by a politic\r\nmarriage, openly supported Ottokar, who was also aided by the Ascanian\r\nmargraves of Brandenburg. In place of the imposing army of 1276, the\r\nonly German princes who sent active aid to Rudolf were Frederick of\r\nHohenzollern and the Bishop of Basel. But the balance was turned in his\r\nfavour by the alliance of Ladislaus IV. of Hungary and by the support of\r\nthe Austrian and Styrian nobles, whom Ottokar had failed to conciliate.\r\nIn a great battle on the Marchfeld, the victory was decided by a charge\r\nof the heavy-armed cavalry under Frederick of Hohenzollern, and Ottokar\r\nhimself perished on the field (August 26, 1278). His death made Rudolf’s\r\nvictory decisive. Otto of Brandenburg, who undertook the guardianship of\r\nthe young king of Bohemia, Wenzel II., negotiated a treaty in October\r\nwhich renewed the stipulations of 1276 as to the cession of the Austrian\r\nprovinces and the double marriage between the Hapsburg and Bohemian\r\nfamilies. In December 1282 Rudolf formally invested his sons, Albert and\r\nRudolf, with the imperial fiefs of Austria, Styria, and Carniola. The\r\nduchy of Carinthia was given to Meinhard, Count of Tyrol, whose daughter\r\nwas married to Albert of Austria.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Hapsburg dynasty in Austria is [Sidenote:\r\nRudolf in later years.] an important event in German history. It was the\r\ngreat achievement of Rudolf’s reign, and it was his last notable\r\nsuccess. His later attempts to strengthen the central monarchy in\r\nGermany were, in the main, fruitless. A series of edicts to secure the\r\npublic peace by restricting the practice of private war, gained the\r\ngrateful approval of the towns and the lesser nobles, but were rendered\r\nineffectual by the absence in Germany of an efficient system of\r\njurisdiction and police. An ordinance prohibiting the creation of any\r\nnew county (_Grafschaft_) without royal consent illustrates the general\r\naim of Rudolf’s government, but proved little more than a dead letter.\r\nThe recovery of the lost imperial domains, which Rudolf had pledged\r\nhimself to undertake at his election, was a task beyond his strength.\r\nEven the towns, on whose support he reckoned, were alienated by his\r\nattempt to raise an imperial revenue by their taxation; and the\r\nappearance of a number of pretenders claiming to be Frederick II. showed\r\na tendency to contrast Rudolf’s government with that of his predecessor,\r\nwho had been enabled to spare his German subjects by the wealth which he\r\nextracted from Italy. A still more serious difficulty was the obstinate\r\nrefusal of the electors to choose his son Albert as his successor during\r\nhis own lifetime. This was the most pressing object of Rudolf’s last\r\nyears, and it was unfulfilled when he died on July 15, 1291, at the age\r\nof seventy-three. If he had lived two centuries earlier, he might have\r\nranked among the greatest of German kings; as it is, he will always be\r\nremembered as the founder of the greatest of German dynasties.\r\n\r\nThe objection to Albert of Austria rested on the considerable [Sidenote:\r\nAdolf of Nassau.] territories, both in the east and in Swabia, which he\r\ninherited from his father. The same motives which had induced the\r\nelectors in 1273 to choose Rudolf, led them to look for a successor\r\nwhose position should be still more humble than Rudolf’s had been. The\r\ninfluence of the Archbishop of Mainz, Gerhard von Eppenstein, secured\r\nthe election of another ‘poor count,’ Adolf of Nassau (May 5, 1292). He\r\nhad purchased votes by promises, which he could only fulfil by pawning\r\nthe scanty remnants of the imperial domains. But Adolf’s ambition was\r\ngreater than his material power, and he had no intention of reigning as\r\nthe submissive puppet of the electors. No sooner had he received the\r\ncrown at Aachen (June 24) than he led an army against Albert, and forced\r\nhim to do homage and to surrender the royal insignia which he had\r\nretained on his father’s death. To repress the great princes, Adolf set\r\nhimself to conciliate the towns and the lesser nobles. Taking advantage\r\nof the death of Frederick of Meissen and Thuringia, he claimed those\r\nterritories as vacant imperial fiefs, and prepared to found there a\r\nhereditary principality as his predecessor had done on the Danube. Still\r\nmore noteworthy was the attitude which he assumed towards France. The\r\nkingdom of Arles or Burgundy, [Sidenote: Relations with France.] founded\r\nby Rudolf I. (888-912) and enlarged by Rudolf II. (912-937) had, after\r\nthe death of Rudolf III. (1032), fallen to the German king, Conrad II.\r\nSince then the crown of Arles had been regarded as one of the three\r\ncrowns, with those of Germany and Italy, which passed on election to\r\nsuccessive kings of the Romans. But as the German monarchy declined, the\r\nsupremacy in Burgundy became more and more nominal, and many Emperors\r\nneglected the ceremony of coronation at Arles altogether. The kingdom\r\nsplit up into a number of quasi-independent provinces, of which the\r\nchief were the free county of Burgundy (Franche-comté), Savoy, Dauphiné,\r\nthe Lyonnais, and Provence. These provinces, though in theory they were\r\nheld as fiefs of the Empire, were gradually subjected to systematic\r\naggressions from the side of France, and Philip IV. (1285-1314) pursued\r\nthis policy of absorption more boldly and openly than any of his\r\npredecessors. Adolf sought to strengthen himself by posing as the\r\nchampion of the unity of the Empire, and in 1294 concluded a treaty with\r\nEdward I. of England by which the two princes pledged themselves not to\r\nlay down their arms until Philip had withdrawn from the territories he\r\nwas trying to wrest from both of them. But the war which followed only\r\nbrought out clearly the disunion and military impotence of Germany. The\r\nGerman princes cared nothing for the border provinces as compared with\r\ntheir own interests and independence. It was easy for Philip IV. to stir\r\nup opposition to Adolf, and when peace was negotiated by Boniface VIII.\r\nin 1298, no satisfaction was given to the imperial claims.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the electors and princes had been seriously [Sidenote: Adolf’s\r\nfall.] alarmed by Adolf’s alliance with the lesser nobles and towns, and\r\nby his temporary successes in Thuringia. To put down the prince whom\r\nthey had chosen, they turned to Albert of Austria whom they had\r\nrejected. Albert, who had already formed a close alliance with Wenzel\r\nII. of Bohemia, and had been in communication with the French king, was\r\neager to strike a blow for his father’s crown. The Archbishop of Mainz\r\nsummoned a meeting of princes to Frankfort on May 1, 1298, and Albert\r\nset out to attend it with an army at his back. Adolf, however, collected\r\ntroops from his supporters among the lesser nobles, and prepared to\r\ndispute his passage. By superior strategy Albert marched round his\r\nopponent to the south, and succeeded in reaching Mainz, whither the\r\nmeeting was transferred. Here the electors formally declared Adolf’s\r\ndeposition (June 23), but the irregular proposal of Albert of Saxony to\r\nelect Albert of Austria on the spot met with no support. The army of the\r\nprinces now advanced against the king, and after a desperate struggle\r\nnear Göllheim, Adolf was slain—struck from his horse, it was said, by\r\nthe hand of his rival (July 2). He had made a brief but creditable\r\nattempt to rule as a German king, but was too weak to face the hostile\r\ncoalition of the princes. His schemes in Thuringia and Meissen perished\r\nwith him, and the House of Wettin recovered its territories.\r\n\r\nAfter Albert’s victory as champion of the electors, the [Sidenote:\r\nAlbert I.] latter could no longer avoid choosing him to fill the vacant\r\nthrone; but they soon had ample reason to recognise the wisdom of their\r\nprevious refusal. Albert inherited his father’s policy, with more\r\nrestless energy and greater military capacity. What he might have done\r\nfor the Hapsburg dynasty and the German monarchy if his career had not\r\nbeen prematurely cut short by assassination it is impossible to say, but\r\nthe ten years of his reign are full of great enterprises, most of which\r\npromised successful results. The reputation for cruelty which he bears\r\nin history is mainly due to the sternness of his manner and appearance,\r\nincreased by the loss of an eye, and to the fables which have grown up\r\nround him in the more than dubious traditions of the Swiss.\r\n\r\nTo coerce Pope Boniface VIII., who refused to acknowledge [Sidenote:\r\nAlbert’s policy.] his election, Albert concluded a treaty with Philip\r\nIV. of France, who had a quarrel of his own with the Papacy, and thus\r\nabandoned the attempt of Adolf to defend the Burgundian frontiers. In\r\nDecember, 1299, he had a personal interview with Philip, and arranged a\r\nmarriage between the French princess Blanche and his eldest son Rudolf.\r\nIn German politics he set himself to favour the towns against the\r\nprinces, and infuriated the latter by an edict abolishing all tolls on\r\nthe Rhine imposed since the death of Frederick II. in 1250. The death of\r\nthe Count of Holland and Zealand (October, 1299) gave him an opportunity\r\nto claim these provinces as vacant imperial fiefs in opposition to John\r\nof Hainault, who claimed the inheritance through his mother. This\r\nscheme, however, proved a failure, and the House of Avesnes succeeded in\r\nadding Holland and Zealand to Hainault. Encouraged by Albert’s check in\r\nthe north-west, the Rhenish archbishops and the Elector Palatine,\r\nfurious at the threatened loss of their tolls, formed a league against\r\nthe king whom they had voted for two years before. But Albert was not so\r\npowerless as Adolf had been. Backed by the enthusiastic support of the\r\ncities and aided by French auxiliaries, he took the aggressive against\r\nhis opponents, and compelled them not only to abolish the tolls, but to\r\nrecognise the right of the towns to receive burghers of the pale\r\n(_Pfahlbürger_)—that is, to confer the privileges and immunities of\r\ncitizenship on residents in the suburbs outside the walls. Few German\r\nkings since Henry III. had been so successful in coercing their powerful\r\nvassals as was Albert in these campaigns of 1301 and 1302.\r\n\r\nFor the next few years Albert’s attention was mainly [Sidenote:\r\nSuccession in Hungary.] absorbed in eastern affairs. The death of Andrew\r\nIII., the last male of the Arpad dynasty in Hungary, left that kingdom\r\nwithout any obvious heir. There were two candidates, who were descended\r\nfrom the royal family through females—Otto of Lower Bavaria, and Charles\r\nRobert or Carobert, the grandson of Charles II., the Angevin king of\r\nNaples. But the Magyar nobles passed over both, and offered the crown to\r\nWENZEL II. of Bohemia, who accepted it for his son Wenzel III. Such an\r\naccession of power to the Premyslides was entirely opposed to Albert’s\r\ninterests, both as King of Germany and as Duke of Austria. As he had no\r\nlove for the Wittelsbachs in Lower Bavaria, he did not hesitate to\r\nespouse the cause of Carobert, the son of his sister Clementia, and the\r\ncandidate supported by Boniface VIII., with whom Albert had reconciled\r\nhimself in 1302. For a time the Bohemian power proved too strong, but\r\nthe death of Wenzel II. (June, 1305) and the growing discontent in\r\nHungary with the conduct of the young king, enabled Carobert to secure\r\nthe crown, though his title was disputed for a time by Otto of\r\nWittelsbach.\r\n\r\nIn the next year (August, 1306) the murder of the young [Sidenote:\r\nSuccession in Bohemia.] Wenzel III. left the Bohemian crown itself\r\nvacant. The sister of the late king had married Henry of Carinthia and\r\nTyrol, the brother of Albert’s wife.[2] In spite of this relationship\r\nAlbert claimed the kingdom as a vacant fief, and conferred it upon his\r\neldest son Rudolf. The consent of the Bohemian nobles was extorted or\r\npurchased, and an agreement that Rudolf’s brothers should succeed if he\r\nhimself died childless, seemed to secure to the Hapsburgs the permanent\r\npossession of a kingdom which, added to their Austrian territories,\r\nwould make them all-powerful on the eastern frontier of Germany. This\r\nwas the greatest of Albert’s achievements, and, if the acquisition had\r\nbeen permanent, would have made his reign as important in Hapsburg\r\nhistory as his father’s had been. But his last years were clouded with\r\ndisappointment. An attempt to renew his predecessor’s claims upon\r\nMeissen and Thuringia was repulsed by Frederick of Wettin, who defeated\r\nthe royal army, under Frederick of Hohenzollern, near Altenburg (May 31,\r\n1307). This defeat was followed by the sudden death, on July 4, of the\r\nyouthful Rudolf of Bohemia. The Bohemians had tired of Hapsburg rule,\r\nand in spite of the agreement made at Rudolf’s election, they now\r\noffered the crown to Henry of Carinthia. Albert had already made one\r\nincursion into Bohemia, and was preparing another, [Sidenote: Albert’s\r\ndeath.] when he was treacherously murdered by his nephew, John (May 1,\r\n1308).\r\n\r\nJohn was the son of Albert’s brother Rudolf and Agnes, daughter of\r\nOttokar, and seems to have resented his uncle’s refusal either to\r\nsupport his candidature for the Bohemian crown, or to give him any share\r\nof the Hapsburg territories. The assassination, therefore, was the\r\nresult of mere personal pique, but it was as important as if it had\r\narisen from a deep-laid political scheme. If Albert had lived longer he\r\nwould very probably have established his son Frederick in Bohemia, and\r\nrendered his election to the German kingship inevitable. In that case\r\nthe Hapsburgs might have founded a territorial monarchy in Germany, and\r\nthe House of Luxemburg would never have risen from obscurity. The\r\ncomplaint that Albert neglected to enforce imperial pretensions in Italy\r\nis well founded, but should rather be set to the credit of his political\r\ncapacity. The Italian connection was fatal to the best interests of\r\nGermany. A far more serious criticism is his failure to resist the\r\naggressions of France. He aided the House of Anjou to acquire the crown\r\nof Hungary in addition to that of Naples, and although for the moment\r\nCharles Robert’s candidature was opposed by Philip IV., it was certain\r\nthat in the long-run the Angevin and Capet interests would combine the\r\ntwo families. He made no opposition to the transference of the papal\r\nresidence from Rome to Avignon, though the disadvantage to Germany was\r\nobvious when Clement V. filled the Rhenish archbishoprics with partisans\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nIt resulted from these changes that French influence was [Sidenote:\r\nElection of Henry VII.] very prominent in the election of 1308, and was\r\nstrong enough to secure the exclusion of Albert’s heir, Frederick the\r\nHandsome. Philip IV.’s brother, Charles of Valois, came forward as a\r\ncandidate and was openly supported by the Pope. But the secular princes\r\nwere strong enough to resist such a sacrifice of German interests to\r\necclesiastical pressure, although their own interests prevented them\r\nfrom supporting the Hapsburg. At this juncture, the Archbishop Baldwin\r\nof Trier (appointed in 1307) suggested as a compromise the choice of his\r\nbrother, Henry of Luxemburg. He was the descendant of the counts of\r\nLimburg and Arlon, who had acquired Luxemburg by marriage in 1214. His\r\nterritorial power was too small to inspire jealousy in Germany, while he\r\nwas connected with France by education and by military service in the\r\nwar against Edward I. As no other candidate had any chance of election,\r\nHenry VII. was chosen without opposition on October 28, 1308. The\r\nHapsburgs found it necessary to acknowledge the new king on condition of\r\nreceiving confirmation of their fiefs.\r\n\r\nThe personal career of Henry VII. belongs rather to the [Sidenote:\r\nItalian expedition.] history of Italy than that of Germany, and will be\r\nconsidered in the following chapter. From the first he seems to have\r\nlooked on Germany as a foreigner, and abandoned the policy of his\r\npredecessor for the wild dream of reviving the imperial power of the\r\nHohenstaufen in Italy at the head of the Ghibelline party. In 1310 he\r\nset out on his southern expedition, which resulted in little beyond his\r\ncoronation in Rome (June 29, 1312). He never returned to Germany. But\r\nbefore his departure he took some steps which were fraught with future\r\nconsequence. To conciliate the princes he withdrew the concessions by\r\nwhich Albert had purchased the support of the towns. In 1310 [Sidenote:\r\nConcessions to the princes.] he prohibited the creation of\r\n_pfahlbürger_, and restored their tolls to the Rhenish princes. In the\r\nsame year he seized the opportunity to obtain a great acquisition for\r\nhis family. The Bohemians were in rebellion against Henry of Carinthia,\r\nand offered the crown to Henry VII.’s son, John, on condition that he\r\nshould marry Elizabeth, [Sidenote: John of Bohemia.] daughter of Wenzel\r\nII. The offer was accepted; but so little did Henry care even for his\r\nfamily interests in comparison with his chimerical schemes, that he did\r\nnot delay his advance into Italy, and left the securing of his son’s\r\nthrone to the Archbishop of Mainz, Peter von Aspelt. Fortunately, the\r\nenterprise did not require his presence. Henry of Carinthia was\r\nexpelled, and John of Luxemburg was firmly seated on the Bohemian\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nDuring the Italian expedition, which ended in Henry VII.’s [Sidenote:\r\nFrance seizes Lyons.] death near Siena (August 24, 1313), the interests\r\nof the German monarchy were neglected, the princes were left in complete\r\nindependence, and Philip IV. was enabled to carry on his aggressions\r\nwith impunity. In 1310 he took advantage of a dispute between the\r\narchbishop and the citizens of Lyons to send French troops into the\r\ncity, and in 1312 the former was compelled to make a treaty by which he\r\nacknowledged the suzerainty of France.\r\n\r\nForty years had now elapsed since the close of the Great [Sidenote:\r\nImportance of period 1273-1313 in German history.] Interregnum. The\r\nkingly office had been revived, and had been held by four princes, each\r\nof whom had shown considerable vigour and capacity. But the absence of\r\nhereditary succession had rendered impossible the pursuit of any\r\nefficient scheme for the enforcement of central authority and the\r\nrepression of princely independence. The greatest successes in this\r\ndirection had been gained by Albert I., but they had been rendered\r\nnugatory by his untimely death and by his successor’s absorption in\r\ndreams of reviving the universal empire. Germany in 1313, as in 1273,\r\nwas a mere bundle of states under a nominal head, while its neighbours\r\nEngland and France had been receiving a strong national organisation\r\nunder the capable rule of Edward I. and Philip IV. That Germany escaped\r\nfor a century from the worst consequences of her disunion was mainly due\r\nto the jarring interests of the neighbouring states which led to the\r\nHundred Years’ War.\r\n\r\nBut it is misleading to regard the history of these forty years as a\r\nmere chronicle of heroic efforts ending in hopeless failure. The very\r\ndivisions of Germany, while they weakened its nationality, gave greater\r\nscope and variety to local development. From this period we date the\r\nrise to greatness of the two vigorous dynasties of Luxemburg and\r\nHapsburg. To it we have also to look for the first origins of the Swiss\r\nConfederation [see chap. vii.], for the rise of the Hanseatic League\r\n[see chap. xviii.], and for the establishment of a great territorial\r\npower in Prussia by the Teutonic Order [see chap. xix.]. It is necessary\r\nto follow the fortunes of the monarchy in order to understand why German\r\ndevelopment was so different from that of other contemporary states, but\r\nthe real interest of German history is to be found in the vigorous\r\ngrowth of these political organisations on the extremities rather than\r\nin the declining vitality of the central power.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  For Rudolf’s position in Swabia see below, chap. vii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  See Genealogical Table A, in Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n                    ITALY AND THE PAPACY, 1273-1313\r\n\r\n\r\n    Italy in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries—Causes of Italian\r\n    disunion—The Guelfs and Ghibellines—The Italian towns—The House of\r\n    Anjou in Naples—The Sicilian Vespers—The Popes and their\r\n    States—Celestine V. is succeeded by Boniface VIII.—The last of the\r\n    Mediæval Popes—The difficulties of Benedict XI. and Clement V.—The\r\n    retirement of Clement V. to Avignon and beginning of the\r\n    ‘Babylonish Captivity’—The condition of Tuscany—The Florentine\r\n    Constitution—Genoa and Milan—The Venetian Constitution—Henry VII.\r\n    makes an Expedition into Italy—Its failure—Death of Henry VII.\r\n\r\nThe two centuries which are treated in this volume constitute [Sidenote:\r\nItaly in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.] the most brilliant\r\nperiod in Italian history since the age of Augustus. The absence of any\r\ncentral authority, which disappeared even more completely in Italy than\r\nin Germany, opened the way for the growth of a number of political\r\norganisations, whose history is as fascinating as their variety is\r\nbewildering. In addition to the great dynasties of Anjou, Visconti, and\r\nMedici, we have to watch the fortunes of the great republics of Venice,\r\nFlorence, and Genoa, of the temporal states of the Church, and of a\r\nnumber of lesser families, such as the House of Este in Ferrara, the\r\ndella Scalas in Verona, the Gonzagas in Mantua, the Montefeltri in\r\nUrbino, whose kaleidoscopic changes are narrated with such wealth of\r\ndetail in the volumes of Sismondi. But what gives its special importance\r\nto the history of this period is that in it Italy becomes the teacher of\r\nEurope. It is to Italy that we trace that great movement, known as the\r\nRenaissance, which began with the revival of classical learning, but led\r\non to the growth of national literatures, to the rise of a new spirit in\r\nthe arts of painting and sculpture, and to the enfranchisement of human\r\nthought from the fetters of superstition, routine, and the formulas of\r\nscholasticism. In the fifteenth century, Italy originated the art of\r\nwriting history as distinguished from the compilation of mediæval\r\nchronicles. And finally, Italy instructed Europe in politics as well as\r\nin letters and art. The foremost European rulers of the sixteenth\r\ncentury learnt the maxims of government from Italian princes and Italian\r\nwriters: the great states of modern times learnt from Italy the\r\npractices of diplomacy and the theory of the balance of power. Political\r\nscience, which had made no progress since the days of Aristotle, was\r\nrevived by the writings of Machiavelli and Guicciardini.\r\n\r\nYet Italy profited less than any other state from the lessons which she\r\ntaught. France, England, and Spain, all of them the pupils of Italy,\r\nbecame strong, united, and wealthy states, while Italy herself, in the\r\nvery middle of an intellectual and artistic activity which has remained\r\nthe wonder of the world, subsided into political insignificance, and\r\nonly finds a place in subsequent history as the stage on which other\r\nnations fight out their quarrels. The solution of this crucial problem,\r\nthe combination of intellectual progress with political decadence, can\r\nonly be found in a careful study of the conditions which [Sidenote:\r\nCauses of Italian disunion.] prevented the people of Italy from\r\nfollowing the normal tendencies of the period, and becoming a nation.\r\nThe causes of disunion are too numerous and deep-seated to be summed up\r\nin a few sentences. But it may be instructive to form a clear\r\nconception, at starting, of some of the most notable conditions which\r\ninfluenced the course of Italian history in the period which we have to\r\nconsider. In the first place, geography in Italy, as in Greece, tended\r\nto disunion. The Apennines cut off the Lombard plain from the rest of\r\nItaly, and divided the latter into two unequal parts which were again\r\nsplit up by the lateral offshoots into divisions, not quite so small as\r\nthose of Greece, but almost equally marked off. The nominal subjection\r\nto an elective emperor, who was also king of Germany, rendered\r\nimpossible the rise of any strong native power which could weld together\r\nthe separate political units. The influence of the Papacy, which in the\r\nthirteenth century combined the sovereignty of an Italian state with the\r\nspiritual headship of Latin Christendom, proved almost as great an\r\nobstacle as the Empire to national union. The great length of Italy, by\r\nincreasing isolation, hindered the growth of common interests. The\r\nleagues occasionally founded for common aims, such as the Lombard league\r\nagainst Frederick Barbarossa and the league of Venice against Charles\r\nVIII., were never more than temporary alliances, and fell to pieces as\r\nsoon as their immediate object was gained.\r\n\r\nThe long quarrel between the Popes and the Hohenstaufen [Sidenote:\r\nGuelfs and Ghibellines.] Emperors bequeathed a fatal heritage to Italy\r\nin the party feuds of Guelfs and Ghibellines. These famous factions not\r\nonly set one state against another, but also gave rise to violent\r\ndiscord within each state. And the parties lasted long after the\r\noriginal cause of quarrel had come to an end. When the Hohenstaufen had\r\nperished with Manfred and Conradin, when Rudolf of Hapsburg had\r\nabandoned all imperial claims over central and southern Italy, when the\r\nPapacy itself had quitted Italy to find a home on the further boundary\r\nof Provence, it seemed as if party feuds must inevitably die out for\r\nwant of the fuel which had originally kindled them. But the blaze of\r\nmutual hatred continued to rage as fiercely as ever. The famous strife\r\nof the _Bianchi_ and _Neri_ in Florence, which drove Dante into exile\r\nfrom his native city, was fought out when Albert I. and Boniface VIII.\r\nwere in close alliance. These stereotyped and quasi-hereditary feuds\r\nwere not only destructive of all sense of nationality, but they were\r\nstrong enough to overpower the far stronger and more local sentiment of\r\ncommon citizenship.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the strongest of all the disruptive forces in Italy was the\r\ndevelopment, in the northern and central provinces, of the municipality\r\nor commune as the normal [Sidenote: The Commune as a political unit.]\r\nunit of political life. This applies not only to the republics proper,\r\nbut also to those cities whose liberties were overthrown by the rise of\r\nsome dominant family. The subjection of lesser cities by more powerful\r\nneighbours did not create a state in which all subjects stood in an\r\nequal relation of submission to a despotic government, but one in which\r\nsubject communes were enslaved by a dominant commune, and were excluded\r\nby it from all voice in the government. The citizens of Pavia and\r\nCremona were not the direct subjects of the Visconti on a level with the\r\nMilanese themselves. They were the subjects of Milan, and were ruled by\r\nMilanese governors, just as Pisa and Pistoia were ruled by Florentines.\r\nThe absorption of the lesser cities continued, until in the fifteenth\r\ncentury Italy practically consisted of five dominant states—Naples,\r\nMilan, Venice, Florence, and the Papacy. The result was the creation of\r\na large subject population, deprived of that share in politics which\r\nItalian citizens had learnt in earlier times to consider their dearest\r\nright, and constituting a permanent and dangerous element of discontent.\r\nIt was from this population that the condottieri recruited those\r\nmercenary armies to which Italian writers agree in attributing the\r\ndisasters that befel their country, and it was this population which\r\nwelcomed foreign invasion as a chance of escaping from domestic\r\noppressions. Commines tells us that the Italians ‘welcomed as saints’\r\nthe French army that followed Charles VIII. to Naples, and the phrase is\r\nsignificant of the unsoundness of the political condition of Italy and\r\nof the utter absence of any sense of nationality.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel between Frederick II. and the Popes had been embittered by\r\nthe former’s possession of Naples and Sicily, which brought him into\r\nthreatening proximity to the territories in central Italy which the\r\nPopes claimed to rule. To drive the Hohenstaufen from Italian soil the\r\nPopes did not hesitate to call in foreign assistance. After a vain\r\nattempt to draw England into the quarrel, the crown of Sicily was\r\noffered as a papal fief to [Sidenote: The House of Anjou in Naples.]\r\nCharles of Anjou, the brother of Louis IX., and Count of Provence\r\nthrough his wife Beatrix. At the battle of Grandella near Benevento\r\n(February 26, 1266) Manfred, the illegitimate son of Frederick II., was\r\nslain; and the still more famous battle of Tagliacozzo (August 23, 1268)\r\nwas followed by the capture and execution of Conradin, the last male\r\nrepresentative of the House of Hohenstaufen. These two victories secured\r\nCharles’s possession of Naples and Sicily, though the marriage of\r\nManfred’s daughter, Constance, to Peter III. of Aragon created a rival\r\nclaim which proved a source of subsequent danger.\r\n\r\nAs the acknowledged head of the Guelf party, which was for the moment\r\nsupreme, Charles of Anjou seemed likely to establish his ascendency over\r\nthe greater part of Italy. The Pope, claiming supremacy during the\r\nInterregnum, appointed him imperial vicar and senator of Rome, while a\r\nnumber of cities in Tuscany and Lombardy acknowledged his lordship. But\r\nhis ambitious schemes were suddenly checked by the very power of which\r\nhe posed as the champion. The Papacy discovered that it had called in a\r\nprotector who might prove as dangerous a neighbour as the Hohenstaufen.\r\nGregory X. and Nicolas III., secured in their position by the\r\nconcessions of Rudolf of Hapsburg, did not hesitate to oppose the\r\nfurther progress of the Neapolitan kings by a policy of mediation\r\nbetween the Guelfs and Ghibellines. The election of Martin IV. (February\r\n24, 1281), a creature of Charles, seemed to offer a new opportunity for\r\nAngevin aggression. The ascendency of the Guelf faction was revived, and\r\nCharles was planning an enterprise against Constantinople, when he was\r\narrested by the news of a great disaster. The [Sidenote: Sicilian\r\nVespers, 1282.] Sicilians had long resented the harshness of French\r\nrule, and John of Procida, an old partisan of the Hohenstaufen, had\r\nreturned from his refuge in Aragon to encourage the malcontents and to\r\nsecure for them foreign assistance. His plans were still incomplete,\r\nwhen a sudden rising at Palermo was provoked by a brutal insult offered\r\nto a woman by a French soldier during a procession on Easter Monday\r\n(March 30, 1282). The people rose with shouts of ‘Death to the French!’\r\nand more than four thousand men, women, and children were massacred that\r\nevening. The whole of Sicily joined in the rebellion, and offered the\r\ncrown to Peter III. of Aragon. When Peter arrived in August he found\r\nthat Charles, thirsting for vengeance, had already laid siege to\r\nMessina. But the Catalan [Sidenote: House of Aragon in Sicily.] fleet\r\nunder Roger di Loria, the most distinguished naval commander of his\r\ntime, was too formidable to be faced by the mere transport vessels with\r\nwhich Charles was provided. Sicily was perforce evacuated, and was never\r\nrecovered by the House of Anjou. The Sicilian Vespers gave rise to a\r\ntwenty years’ struggle, which concerns the history of France and Spain\r\nas well as Italy. The Pope decreed Peter’s deposition, both in Sicily\r\nand in Aragon, and offered the latter crown to Charles of Valois, the\r\nsecond son of Philip the Fair. But papal bulls failed to overcome\r\nAragonese obstinacy and Sicilian devotion. In 1283 Charles’s son of the\r\nsame name was captured in a naval battle by Roger di Loria, and remained\r\na prisoner for the next five years. In 1285 Charles I. of Anjou died\r\n(January 7), after a career which had known no failure till towards its\r\nclose. The same year witnessed the successive deaths of Pope Martin IV.\r\n(March 12) and of Peter III. (November 11). The latter was succeeded in\r\nAragon by his eldest son Alfonso, and in Sicily by his second son James.\r\nIn 1288 the mediation of Edward I. of England resulted in the conclusion\r\nof a treaty by which Charles II. of Anjou was released to take\r\npossession of the Neapolitan crown, and Sicily was confirmed to the\r\nHouse of Aragon. But the treaty was never observed. No sooner was\r\nCharles II. free than Nicolas IV. absolved him from his obligations,\r\nrecognised him as king of the Two Sicilies on the same terms as his\r\nfather, and renewed the excommunication against James. The war continued\r\nwithout a break. In 1291 Alfonso died, and James succeeded to the crown\r\nof Aragon. Wearied of the long struggle, and anxious to free his Spanish\r\nkingdom from the attacks of Charles of Valois, James agreed to renounce\r\nthe crown of Sicily. But the Sicilians refused to return to French rule,\r\nand raised to the throne Frederick, the youngest son of Peter III., who\r\ncontinued the struggle even in opposition to his own brother. At last,\r\nin 1302, after an unsuccessful attack on Sicily by Charles of Valois,\r\npeace was concluded. Frederick was to marry Charles II.’s sister\r\nEleanor, and to retain the kingdom of Sicily during his lifetime, but on\r\nhis death it was to revert to the House of Anjou. This last stipulation\r\nwas never fulfilled, and Sicily and Naples remained under separate\r\nrulers till 1435, when they were reunited under an Aragonese king. The\r\nonly other notable event in the reign of Charles II. of Naples was the\r\nacquisition of the Hungarian crown by his grandson, Carobert, which has\r\nbeen already narrated (see p. 15). In 1309 Charles II. died, and the\r\ncrown of Naples passed to his second son, Robert, the superior\r\nhereditary claims of Carobert of Hungary being passed over. For the next\r\nthirty-four years Robert was the acknowledged head of the Guelf party in\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the kingdom of Naples lay the temporal [Sidenote: The\r\nPapal States.] dominions which the Popes claimed by virtue of real or\r\npretended donations from Emperors and others. These territories had by\r\nthis time reached the boundaries which they retained to the present\r\ncentury. They included the whole of Romagna, the Pentapolis, the March\r\nof Ancona, and the Patrimony of St. Peter, with the city of Rome and the\r\nCampagna. The concordat with Rudolf of Hapsburg abolished all imperial\r\nsuzerainty over these districts, and thus secured to the Papacy a\r\nterritorial principality which Frederick II. had threatened to\r\nannihilate. But the victory, great as it appeared, was in reality\r\ndeceptive. It had been won with the aid of the House of Anjou, whose\r\nprotection might easily be converted into an oppressive patronage. And\r\nthe difficulties of temporal rule were a serious addition to those of\r\nthe spiritual oversight of Christendom, especially as the Popes were\r\nusually elected in advanced years, and their tenure of office was\r\nnecessarily brief. More than two centuries elapsed before papal\r\nsuzerainty in central Italy developed into direct papal government; and\r\nduring that period the absorption in secular interests not only diverted\r\nthe attention of the Popes from their higher duties, but also tended to\r\nlower their estimation in the eyes of Europe. The localisation of the\r\nPapacy in central Italy, while it gave some appearance of security to\r\nthe papal power, really degraded it, just as the identification with the\r\nGerman monarchy degraded the dignity of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThere is little reason to linger over the history of the [Sidenote: The\r\nPopes, 1272-1290.] individuals who fill the papal chair from the end of\r\nthe Interregnum till the departure to Avignon. Gregory X. (1271-1276),\r\nelected after a vacancy of nearly three years, was a man of high\r\ncharacter and ability, but he did not rule long enough to accomplish any\r\ngreat ends. He set himself to restore order in Germany, to put an end to\r\nparty strife in Italy, and to check the arrogant ambition of Charles of\r\nNaples. The council which he held at Lyons in 1274 is chiefly notable\r\nfor the regulations drawn up to prevent delays and external intervention\r\nin papal elections. Ten days after the death of a Pope, the cardinals\r\npresent on the spot were to be shut up in conclave, and were to remain\r\nexcluded from intercourse with the outside world until they had agreed\r\non the choice of a successor. Gregory’s short-lived successors were\r\nmainly occupied with their relations with Naples, with party struggles\r\nin Italy, and with the growth of the noble families in Rome. Temporal\r\ndominion, in which hereditary succession was impossible, brought with it\r\nthe vice of nepotism, the desire to make the most of a short tenure of\r\noffice for the aggrandisement of relatives. Nicolas III. (1277-1280)\r\nbestowed lavish grants on the great House of Orsini, to which he\r\nbelonged; Martin IV. (1281-1285) was a mere puppet of Charles of Anjou,\r\nand resided in his company at Viterbo; Honorius IV. (1285-1287) was a\r\nSavelli, and exalted his family at the expense of the Orsini; while\r\nNicolas IV. (1288-1292) raised the Colonna as a counterpoise to the\r\nother two families. From this time the history of Rome was filled with\r\nthe feuds of these great baronial houses, and they exercised a most\r\ndisastrous influence on the spiritual as well as on the temporal\r\nposition of the Popes.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Nicolas IV. these baronial factions were so [Sidenote:\r\nCelestine V., 1294.] predominant and so evenly balanced in the conclave\r\nthat no election could take place for two years. At last, in 1294, a\r\nsudden impulse induced the cardinals to throw aside all secular\r\nconsiderations and to offer the highest ecclesiastical dignity to a man\r\nwhose only claim was his reputation for sanctity. Celestine V. had for\r\nyears lived a hermit’s life in a cave near Sulmona. His election was a\r\nunique experiment in papal history, and it was unsuccessful. Personal\r\npiety was no sufficient substitute for the worldly wisdom and experience\r\nrequired for the occupant of the papal chair. After five months he was\r\npersuaded to abdicate, and ultimately died (May, 1296) in a prison to\r\nwhich he was consigned by his successor, Boniface VIII.\r\n\r\nThe pontificate of Boniface VIII. is by far the most important\r\n[Sidenote: Boniface VIII., 1294-1303.] of this period. He has been\r\ncalled the last of the mediæval Popes. He was certainly the last who\r\nattempted to exercise that general authority over Christendom which\r\nGregory VII. had claimed and Innocent III. had acquired. His complete\r\nfailure proved how little the Papacy really profited by its victory over\r\nthe Empire. In order to weaken the authority of the Emperors, the Popes\r\nhad encouraged the growing nationality of the outlying kingdoms,\r\nforgetful that they were forging a weapon which might be used against\r\nthemselves. Honorius III. and Innocent IV. had waged a desperate\r\nstruggle against Frederick II. But the defeat of the Hohenstaufen did\r\nnot, as they expected, leave the Papacy supreme. Boniface VIII. found\r\nequally formidable opponents in Edward I. of England and Philip IV. of\r\nFrance. The Papacy might defeat the Empire, because the latter was\r\nopposed to all the tendencies of the age, but it was powerless against\r\nthe force of national development. To coerce the French and English\r\nkings, who refused to submit to his arbitration, Boniface issued the\r\nbull _Clericis laicos_ which forbade the clergy to pay taxes to the\r\nsecular power. Edward I. replied by outlawing the clergy, and forced\r\nthem to acknowledge their membership of the state and to contribute to\r\nits support. Philip IV. retaliated by prohibiting the export of money\r\nfrom France, and thus cut off French contributions to Rome. When the\r\nPope claimed Scotland as a papal fief and forbade any further English\r\ninvasions, Edward I. brought the bull before a parliament at Lincoln\r\n(1301), which decreed that the king should not answer before the Pope on\r\nany question concerning his temporal rights. Philip IV. met the\r\nexorbitant papal pretensions by a similar protest from the national\r\nrepresentatives at a meeting of the States-General (1302). And the\r\nFrench king did not content himself with verbal protests. Taking\r\nadvantage of the discontent of the Colonnas, French troops entered\r\nAnagni, where Boniface was residing, and for a few days kept him a\r\nprisoner. This insult was a terrible blow to the proud Pope, and a few\r\nweeks later he died (October, 1303).\r\n\r\nBenedict XI., the new Pope, had a difficult task to avoid [Sidenote:\r\nBenedict XI., 1303-1304.] either a degrading submission to France or a\r\nnew quarrel with Philip IV. and the Colonnas. To escape intimidation he\r\nwithdrew to Perugia, and for a time succeeded in maintaining a\r\nconciliatory but not dishonourable attitude. At last he found it\r\nnecessary to issue a bull against the chief authors of the outrage at\r\nAnagni (June 29, 1304). Four weeks later the Pope was dead, and\r\ncontemporaries were almost unanimous in attributing his death to poison.\r\nThe posthumous reputation of Boniface VIII. was now the vital question\r\nat issue, and the cardinals were almost evenly divided into a French\r\nparty which condemned him, and an Italian party which anathematised his\r\nassailants. So irreconcilable were the two parties that the cardinals,\r\nthough shut up in the palace at Perugia in accordance with the\r\nconstitution of Gregory X., spent ten months in the vain attempt to\r\nchoose a new Pope. At last the deadlock was terminated by a strange\r\ncompromise. The supporters of Boniface were to name three non-Italian\r\nprelates, and the hostile party was to choose one of them. One of the\r\nthree was the Archbishop of Bordeaux, whose diocese lay within the\r\ndominions of Edward I. His selection was due to the belief that he was\r\nthe bitter enemy of the French king. But tradition maintained that\r\nPhilip IV. contrived to buy him over to his side, [Sidenote: Clement V.,\r\n1305-1313.] and he was chosen Pope as Clement V. The coronation ceremony\r\ntook place at Lyons, and the new Pope never ventured into Italy. His\r\npontificate was one long struggle to avoid or to moderate the\r\nconcessions which Philip expected from him. The charges against Boniface\r\nwere ultimately referred to a council at Vienna, which exonerated his\r\nmemory. But on most points Clement had to follow the wishes of the\r\nFrench king, especially in the condemnation of the Templars. In 1309\r\nClement V. fixed his residence at Avignon, which was not then a French\r\ntown, and was probably chosen partly for that reason, and partly for its\r\nneighbourhood to the Venaissin, already a papal possession. But Avignon\r\nwas in Provence, which was held by the House of Anjou, and it was only\r\nseparated from France by the Rhone. As long as the Popes continued to\r\nlive there, they were exposed to overwhelming French influence, and\r\ncould hardly escape the charge, made both from England and Germany, that\r\nthey were mere vassals of the king of France. It says much for the\r\nvitality of the papal system that the ‘Babylonish captivity,’ as the\r\nnext seventy years have been called, did not result in the complete\r\nloss, not only of the Italian provinces, but of all spiritual authority\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nThe district of Tuscany, which lies to the north-west of the Papal\r\nStates, had been split up since the death of the [Sidenote: Tuscany.]\r\nCountess Matilda into a number of city states, mostly republics, but\r\nwhich from time to time were subject to native or foreign despots.\r\nSiena, which became in the fifteenth century mistress of southern\r\nTuscany, had not yet risen into prominence and never ranked among the\r\ngreat states of Italy. Pisa, hitherto the most powerful of the Tuscan\r\ncommunes and one of the greatest of Italian ports, began to decline when\r\nthe restoration of the Eastern Empire (1261) established the ascendency\r\nof Genoa in the Levant. In the naval struggle which followed, the two\r\nrepublics were fairly evenly balanced; but a great Genoese victory off\r\nthe island of Meloria (1284) inflicted a blow from which Pisa never\r\nrecovered, though she retained her independence for another century.\r\nLucca rose to some importance under Castruccio Castracani, and from time\r\nto time successfully resisted the aggressions of Florence, but has no\r\ncontinuous history that attracts attention. By far the most important of\r\nthe Tuscan cities was Florence, destined to be [Sidenote: Florence.] for\r\na brilliant period the chief home of Italian art and literature, to\r\nacquire the supremacy over the whole of Tuscany, and to become for a few\r\nyears in the present century the capital of an Italian kingdom. It is at\r\nthe end of the thirteenth century that the foundation was laid of the\r\nFlorentine constitution, which has always attracted special attention on\r\naccount both of its own peculiarities and of the greatness of the city\r\nin which it grew up.\r\n\r\nNo city in Italy had been more convulsed than Florence [Sidenote:\r\nConstitution of Florence.] by the struggle between Guelfs and\r\nGhibellines, and these factions were the more embittered against each\r\nother by their coincidence with class distinctions. The feudal nobles,\r\nalthough by no means united, were preponderantly Ghibelline, while the\r\nwealthy burghers were inclined to the cause of the Papacy and Charles of\r\nAnjou. After the defeat of Manfred in 1266 the supremacy of the Guelfs\r\nwas established, and was never overthrown from that date. For some years\r\nthe government was moderate and pacific, but the news of the Sicilian\r\nVespers in 1282 frightened the Guelfs into an attempt to secure their\r\npower by constitutional changes. The existing magistrates were\r\nsuperseded [Sidenote: The ‘Priori.’] by the ‘_Priori delle Arti_,’ at\r\nfirst three and afterwards six in number. These constituted the signory\r\nand held the chief executive power. They were chosen from the seven\r\ngreater guilds (_arti maggiori_) and held office for two months at a\r\ntime, re-election being forbidden (_divieto_) until after an interval of\r\ntwo years. The greater guilds, which had long existed as trade\r\ncorporations before their rise to political importance, consisted of the\r\n_Calimala_, or cloth merchants, the wool-weavers, the bankers, the silk\r\nmanufacturers, physicians, furriers and lawyers. About the same time a\r\nnumber of lesser guilds (_arti minori_) were organised, and their number\r\nincreased within the next sixteen years to fourteen. Henceforth we can\r\ntrace the existence of four main divisions of the people of Florence:\r\n(1) the _grandi_, or nobles; (2) the _popolo grasso_, the members of the\r\nseven greater guilds; (3) the _popolo minuto_, or members of the\r\nfourteen lesser guilds; (4) the _ciompi_, though this name is of later\r\norigin, including those citizens who had no guild organisation, and\r\ntherefore no machinery either for self-government or for influencing the\r\nconduct of public business.\r\n\r\nBy the constitution of 1282 the nobles were not excluded from office,\r\nbut if they wished to qualify themselves for it they had to enter a\r\nguild. Many of them fulfilled this condition, and several nobles held\r\nthe office of prior during the next ten years. But class jealousies\r\ncontinued to create domestic quarrels, and in 1293 Giano della Bella,\r\nhimself of noble origin, proposed and carried the famous [Sidenote:\r\nOrdinances of Justice, 1293.] ‘Ordinances of Justice.’ To qualify for\r\noffice a man must really practise the trade or craft to which he\r\nbelonged. The _grandi_ were not only to be excluded from any share in\r\nthe government, but they were subjected to serious social\r\ndisqualifications. In time of disorder they were confined to their\r\nhouses on penalty of exile. A noble could not accuse a citizen or bear\r\nwitness against him without the consent of the signory, and the severest\r\npenalties were imposed on a noble who wounded or killed a citizen. The\r\nduty of enforcing these ordinances was intrusted to a specially created\r\nofficial, the gonfalonier of justice, who [Sidenote: The Gonfalonier.]\r\nwas to be appointed every two months and was to be a member of the\r\nsignory. The gonfalonier, who was intrusted with the command of a large\r\nforce of infantry, became the most dignified officer of the state,\r\nthough his actual powers were not greater than those of the priors. From\r\nthis time one of the harshest penalties was to confer nobility upon a\r\npolitical offender, and the greatest reward that could be conferred upon\r\na deserving _grande_ was to degrade him to the rank of a citizen. To\r\nprotect the signory from attack a fortified _Palazzo Pubblico_ was built\r\nfor their reception, a building which is now famous as the _Palazzo\r\nVecchio_.\r\n\r\nAlthough the actual government of Florence from 1293 may be considered\r\nto be a plutocracy, in that the actual conduct of affairs was\r\nmonopolised by the wealthy burghers, yet the constitution possessed a\r\nreal democratic basis. The ultimate power of making any constitutional\r\nchange rested with the _parlamento_, a mass meeting [Sidenote: The\r\nParliament.] of all citizens in the great piazza. Such a meeting could\r\nat any time appoint a _balia_, _i.e._ a committee with full powers to\r\nalter the laws; and it was by this method that most of the revolutions\r\nin Florentine history were accomplished.\r\n\r\nEarly in the fourteenth century the Florentine constitution assumed the\r\nmain features which it retained till the fall of the republic. In 1321 a\r\ndisastrous war with Castruccio Castracani discredited the signory, and\r\ndisplayed the weakness of a government which changed every two months.\r\nTo remedy this, a council of twelve [Sidenote: The ‘Buonuomini.]\r\n_buonuomini_ was created, two from each _sesto_ or district. They were\r\nto hold office for six months instead of two, and the signory was to\r\ntake no important step without consulting them. Two years later a far\r\nmore important change was made, when the system of filling offices by\r\nlot was introduced. Hitherto the members of the outgoing administration\r\nhad elected their successors. But the city was disquieted by factious\r\nquarrels at each election, and there was no security for that equality\r\nwhich was rapidly becoming a passion among the Florentines. In 1323 it\r\nwas determined to hold a _squittinio_, or scrutiny, every two [Sidenote:\r\nThe ‘Squittinio,’ 1323.] years in place of the elections every two\r\nmonths. A committee was formed of the signory for the time being with\r\nthe councils of the greater guilds and other influential citizens. A\r\nlist was drawn up of all citizens qualified for office by age and by\r\nbeing clear of debt to the state (_netti di specchio_). Their names were\r\nthen put up to ballot in the committee. The voting was by black and\r\nwhite beans, the former being in favour of the candidate. All the names\r\nwhich received not less than two-thirds of the black beans were placed\r\nin bags (_imborsare_), and from these bags they were drawn to fill\r\nvacancies as they arose. When the bags were empty a new _squittinio_\r\nbecame necessary. It resulted from this system that qualified citizens\r\nhad a fairly equal chance of selection, but there was no security that\r\noffices would go to the most capable, and the arrangement was liable to\r\nserious abuses. The party which could obtain a majority in the selecting\r\ncommittee (_balia_), was certain to secure most of the offices for its\r\nown partisans for at least two years.\r\n\r\nBy 1323 the Florentine constitution had assumed a fairly definite shape.\r\nAt its head stood the gonfalonier of justice and the six priors, who had\r\nthe chief conduct of affairs and the right of initiating legislation.\r\nThen came the twelve _buonuomini_, who were a sort of privy council to\r\nthe signory, and served as a check on its power. Next in rank were the\r\n_capitano del popolo_, once the chief magistrate of the city, and the\r\nsixteen gonfaloniers of companies, who were responsible for police and\r\nmilitary arrangements. These were known as the three greater offices (_i\r\ntre maggiori_). In critical times special magistracies were sometimes\r\ncreated for a limited time, such as the eight of war (_otto di guerra_),\r\nor the ten of the sea (_dieci del mare_). There were two legislative\r\ncouncils: the _consiglio del popolo_, three hundred in number,\r\ncontaining only _popolani_; and the _consiglio del commune_, numbering\r\ntwo hundred and fifty, to which nobles were also admitted. Besides the\r\nregular municipal magistracies, there was an [Sidenote: The ‘Parte\r\nGuelfa.’] important body, the _parte guelfa_, which exercised very great\r\npolitical influence. This corporation, which had its own captains and\r\ncouncil, had been formed after the great Guelf victory of 1267 to\r\nadminister the confiscated property of the exiled Ghibellines. Its great\r\nwealth and efficient organisation were employed for the assiduous\r\nmaintenance of Guelf ascendency, and in later times for resisting the\r\nclaims of the lower classes to a voice in the government.\r\n\r\nOf the northern states only three deserve special mention [Sidenote:\r\nGenoa.] at this time. Genoa, isolated in the north-western corner and\r\nsurrounded by mountains, plays a very slight part in the general history\r\nof Italy, though it has some considerable importance as commanding the\r\ndirect route from Provence to the peninsula. The energies of its\r\ncitizens were mainly absorbed in the acquisition of wealth by eastern\r\ntrade, in maintaining wars with Pisa and Venice, and in the incessant\r\nfeuds of the great families of Doria and Spinola. Milan, which had long\r\nheld a predominant position among [Sidenote: Milan.] the Lombard towns,\r\nwas already beginning to lose its republican independence. There, as in\r\nFlorence, class divisions were mixed up with the quarrels of factions.\r\nIn 1259 the Guelf leader, Martino della Torre, headed the citizens in a\r\nsuccessful struggle against the Ghibelline nobles, and took advantage of\r\nhis victory to assume the lordship of the city. The neighbouring towns\r\nof Lodi, Como, Vercelli, and Bergamo fell one after another under the\r\nrule of the Della Torre. But in 1277 a revolution was effected by the\r\nGhibellines under the Archbishop of Milan, Otto Visconti, to whom the\r\nlordship of the city was transferred, and from whom it passed on his\r\ndeath in 1295 to his nephew Matteo Visconti, the ancestor of the later\r\ndukes of Milan. But the Visconti dynasty was not yet permanently\r\nestablished, and in 1302 a Guelf league was formed among the chief\r\nLombard towns which forced Matteo to withdraw, and Guido della Torre\r\nbecame the ruler of Milan.\r\n\r\nVenice, the last of the important northern states, was even [Sidenote:\r\nVenice.] more isolated from Italy than Genoa, both by geography and by\r\nits absorbing interests in the Levant. The overthrow of the Greek Empire\r\nin 1204 had given Venice a commanding position in the east, but the\r\nrestoration of 1261 had raised a very formidable rival in Genoa, and for\r\nmore than a century the two republics were engaged in a series of costly\r\nand exhausting wars. But the main interest of Venetian history at this\r\ntime lies in the building up of that oligarchical constitution which\r\ngave to Venice a vigour and consistency of political action quite unique\r\nin Italy, and enabled her in the fifteenth century to establish a very\r\nformidable power on the mainland.\r\n\r\nThe institutions of Venice, though sufficiently alien from [Sidenote:\r\nConstitution of Venice.] modern usages, were simplicity itself as\r\ncompared with those of Florence. This simplicity is due primarily to the\r\nentire absence in Venice of a landed nobility, whose power had to be\r\noverthrown in other Italian cities by a series of revolts on the part of\r\nthe citizens, and also to the fact that Venice remained completely\r\nuntouched by the faction fights of Guelfs and Ghibellines. At the head\r\nof the state stood the doge, elected for life, and in early [Sidenote:\r\nThe Doge.] times possessed of almost autocratic power. But his authority\r\nhad been gradually limited by the compulsory association of councillors,\r\nby the exaction of a solemn oath on election (_promissione ducale_), and\r\nby the creation of new institutions. By the fourteenth century the doge\r\nhad become an ornamental sovereign, surrounded by great pomp and\r\nceremonial, presiding in all assemblies, but possessed of no power of\r\ninitiation and of no means of exerting more than personal influence. A\r\ndoge of strong character might still mould the destinies of Venice, but\r\nit was by persuading his colleagues, not by the exercise of any regal\r\nauthority. The election of the doge rested originally with the whole\r\npeople. In 1172 a council, which grew into the _Maggior Consiglio_, was\r\nintrusted with the task, which was gradually delegated to small\r\ncommittees chosen in various ways. At last, in 1268, the elaborate\r\nsystem was adopted which lasted till the fall of the republic. All\r\nmembers of the Grand Council over thirty years of age drew balls from an\r\nurn, and thirty of these balls were gilt. The thirty who drew the gilt\r\nballs were reduced to nine by a second drawing of lots. The nine elected\r\nforty, seven votes being a necessary minimum. The forty were reduced by\r\nlot to twelve, who elected twenty-five, each receiving at least nine\r\nvotes. The twenty-five were reduced by lot to nine, who elected\r\nforty-five, who must each receive seven votes. The forty-five were\r\nreduced to eleven, who chose forty-one, each to receive nine votes. The\r\nforty-one then took an oath and proceeded to vote for the vacant office.\r\nThe voting was repeated until some candidate had received at least\r\ntwenty-five votes, and he became doge. The form of demanding popular\r\napproval of the election did not become obsolete until the election of\r\nFrancesco Foscari in 1423.\r\n\r\nWith the doge were associated six ducal councillors, who were\r\nnecessarily consulted on every subject and without whom the doge could\r\ndo nothing. In fact, the ducal functions were really discharged, not by\r\nthe doge, but by a committee of seven of whom the doge was one. The\r\n_Collegio_ or cabinet of ministers (_savii_), conducted the routine work\r\nof administration, and prepared all business for the other public\r\nbodies. The business of every department passed through the _Collegio_,\r\nin which the six _savii grandi_ presided in weekly terms. The\r\n_Quarantia_, or Forty, was originally created in the twelfth century to\r\nact as a permanent senate, but it was gradually limited to judicial\r\nfunctions, and became the great law-court of Venice. The functions of\r\nthe senate fell to the _Pregadi_, a body of a hundred and sixty members,\r\nwhose name was derived from the originally voluntary consultation of\r\nprominent citizens by the doge. The _Pregadi_ became a permanent part of\r\nthe constitution in 1229. Their chief business was the first\r\nconsideration of all legislative proposals, the appointment of\r\nambassadors, and the general supervision of foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nAt the basis of the constitution was the _Maggior Consiglio_, [Sidenote:\r\nThe Great Council.] which had gradually taken the place of the primary\r\nassembly of all citizens. The council was originally elective, and its\r\nrise was a natural result of the growth of Venetian population. But in\r\n1297 a law was carried which finally changed the government of Venice\r\nfrom a democracy to a close oligarchy. A list was drawn up of all who\r\nhad sat in the Great Council for the last four years, and their names\r\nwere put up to ballot in the _Quarantia_. All who received twelve votes\r\nwere to be members of the council. Three electors were to be appointed\r\nevery year to make a list of any other candidates, and their names, if\r\napproved by the doge and his councillors, were to be balloted by the\r\n_Quarantia_. For a few years the addition of names was frequent, though\r\nfew candidates were successful unless their ancestors had at some time\r\nor other had a seat in the council. But in 1315 the names of all\r\neligible candidates were drawn up once for all and placed in a book, and\r\nin 1319 the three annual electors were abolished. Henceforth membership\r\nof the Great Council became a hereditary privilege, and the admission of\r\na member’s son as soon as he had reached the age of twenty-five was\r\nregarded as a matter of course. The _serrata del Maggior Consiglio_, or\r\nclosing of the Great Council, divided the Venetian population into two\r\nsharply defined classes: the nobles, who had the privilege of\r\nmembership, and the lower classes, who were for ever excluded from any\r\nvoice in the government.\r\n\r\nAlthough the abolition of popular election in 1297 was a change to which\r\nthings had long been tending, it could hardly take place without\r\nexciting considerable discontent. Several conspiracies were formed\r\nagainst the new oligarchy, and after the failure of a formidable plot\r\nunder Bajamonte Tiepolo in 1310, it was determined to devise some new\r\nmachinery for the detection and repression of future revolts. Ten\r\nmembers were chosen by [Sidenote: Council of Ten, 1319.] the Great\r\nCouncil to act as a sort of committee of public safety. So useful did\r\nthey prove that they were renewed year after year, and in 1335 they were\r\nmade a permanent part of the constitution. The Council really consisted\r\nof seventeen, as the doge and his six councillors were associated with\r\nthe Ten. The latter were elected yearly, and could not hold office again\r\ntill a year had elapsed. The proper function of the Ten was to act as a\r\ncourt of exceptional jurisdiction, somewhat like the Star Chamber in\r\nEngland. In this capacity they served as the efficient bulwark of the\r\nVenetian aristocracy, and coerced the inferior citizens into passive\r\nacquiescence in the rule of their superiors. As time went on, the Ten\r\nbecame more and more powerful, and began to interfere in the general\r\nconduct of affairs. So great became the passion for secrecy in the\r\nVenetian government, that in the sixteenth century the Ten began to\r\ndelegate their functions to a sub-committee, the three Inquisitors of\r\nState.\r\n\r\nFor sixty years Italy had been allowed to take its own course without\r\nany attempt at interference on the part of its nominal suzerain in\r\nGermany. The news that Henry of [Sidenote: Henry VII. in Italy,\r\n1310-1313.] Luxemburg, elected in 1308, was preparing to visit Italy and\r\nto revive the imperial power, made a profound impression in the\r\npeninsula, where the Guelf and Ghibelline parties were as active and\r\nbellicose as ever. These party names had by this time ceased to express\r\nany essential difference of principle. The imperial suzerainty in the\r\nnorth, and the papal suzerainty in the south were equally shadowy, and\r\nneither seemed substantial enough to fight for. The idea that the Guelfs\r\nwere the champions of republican liberty as against aggressive despots,\r\nhad ceased to have any real foundation in facts. A Della Torre was just\r\nas dangerous to the liberties of Milan as a Visconti. Since the Popes\r\nhad called in the House of Anjou, and especially since a Pope had fixed\r\nhis residence in Avignon, it was impossible to contend that the Guelfs\r\nwere the champions of Italian independence against foreign domination.\r\nThe anomalous relations of Italian parties were reflected in the equally\r\nanomalous position of Henry VII. A German prince elected by German\r\nprinces to the throne of the Hohenstaufen, he seemed destined to revive\r\nthe principles of Ghibellinism and to assume the headship of a revived\r\nGhibelline faction. On the other hand, Henry was French by education and\r\nsympathies, he owed his election to the clerical partisans of France\r\nacting under papal influence, and he was accompanied in his march by\r\nlegates whom the Pope had authorised to confer upon him the imperial\r\ncrown in Rome. It was no empty pretence of moderation, but the\r\nexpression of a real policy, when Henry professed that he belonged to\r\nneither faction and intended to act as a mediator between them. And his\r\nactions corresponded with his professions. As he passed through the\r\nLombard cities he insisted on the return of all political exiles,\r\nwhichever party they belonged to. In Milan, where he received the iron\r\ncrown of Lombardy (January 6, 1311), he recalled Matteo Visconti without\r\noverthrowing the rule of Guido della Torre. But the Italians themselves\r\nhad no sympathy with his impartiality. Henry VII., like most of his\r\nGerman predecessors, was in need of money, and the attempt to levy a\r\ncontribution of 100,000 ducats provoked a rising in Milan. The rising\r\nwas suppressed, but it resulted in an inevitable alliance between the\r\nEmperor and the Ghibellines. Guido della Torre and his family were\r\ndriven into exile, and an attempted rebellion in the Guelf cities was\r\nsuppressed. Brescia alone made any lengthy resistance to the German\r\narmy. Before leaving Lombardy, Henry appointed imperial vicars in the\r\nchief cities, and in Milan he intrusted the office to Matteo Visconti,\r\nthus finally establishing the dynasty which ruled Milan for a century\r\nand a half, and at one time seemed likely to unite the whole of northern\r\nItaly under its sway.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the difficulties of Henry VII. rapidly increased. The\r\nforce of circumstances had compelled him to become a Ghibelline against\r\nhis will. The hopes which that party built upon his arrival are\r\nexpressed in the _De Monarchia_ of Dante. Peace could only be bestowed\r\nupon Italy by a strong monarchy, and such a monarchy could only be\r\nestablished by a German king with the traditions of the Empire at his\r\nback. But the more enthusiastic the Ghibellines became, the more\r\nresolute was the opposition of the Guelfs. Robert of Naples, the close\r\nally of Clement V., did not venture to embark on open hostilities, but\r\nhe was rendered both jealous and uneasy by Henry’s progress, and did not\r\nhesitate to intrigue against him. Henry VII. succeeded in obtaining the\r\nlordship of Genoa and Pisa, the latter of which was always on the\r\nGhibelline side. But Florence, the leading Guelf city in Tuscany,\r\nobstinately refused to admit the German king or his troops, and he was\r\ncompelled to pass on one side on his journey to Rome. There he found the\r\ngreater part of the city occupied by the Guelf family of Orsini,\r\nassisted by a Neapolitan force. A battle would have been necessary to\r\nobtain possession of St. Peter’s, and the coronation ceremony had to\r\ntake place in the church of St. John Lateran (June 29, 1312). Henry VII.\r\nwas now convinced that the reduction of Italy to obedience could only be\r\naccomplished by force of arms. King Robert had as yet avoided any\r\ndeclaration of war, and it would have been dangerous to attack Naples\r\nwhile the Guelfs in the north were strong enough to cut off\r\ncommunications with Germany. It was decided to strike terror into the\r\nGuelfs by the reduction of Florence. The German troops advanced to the\r\ncity walls in September, 1312, but they found them too strong and too\r\nwell garrisoned to venture on an attack. Henry retreated to Pisa to\r\nawait reinforcement. Against Robert of Naples, who was preparing to give\r\nactive assistance to Florence, he issued the imperial ban, and concluded\r\nan alliance with the Aragonese king of Sicily. Henry had commenced his\r\nmarch to meet the Neapolitan troops, when he suddenly died of [Sidenote:\r\nDeath of Henry VII., 1313.] fever at Buonconvento, twelve miles from\r\nSiena (August 24, 1313). The Ghibellines believed that he had been\r\npoisoned by a Dominican monk in administering the sacrament. The schemes\r\nof Henry VII. were entirely out of date: the Holy Roman Empire, as Dante\r\nunderstood it, was already an anachronism: and the Emperor’s death is\r\nonly important as marking the failure of the last serious attempt to\r\nreduce Italy to obedience to a German king. The forces of disunion were\r\nstrong enough to break up any monarchy; it was only an added weakness\r\nthat the monarchy was claimed by a foreigner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n                FRANCE UNDER THE LATER CAPETS, 1270-1328\r\n\r\n\r\n    Progress of the French Monarchy—Its difficulties—Philip III.—The\r\n    inheritance to Toulouse, Champagne, and Navarre—Wars with Castile\r\n    and Aragon—Accession of Philip IV. and the importance of his\r\n    reign—His War with England and Flanders—His relations with the\r\n    Papacy—The suppression of the Templars—His policy of annexation—His\r\n    domestic government—The King’s Court and its departments: the\r\n    _conseil du roi_, the _chambre des comptes_, and the _Parlement_ of\r\n    Paris—The States-General—Financial maladministration—Death of Philip\r\n    IV.—Louis X.—His death and the succession question—The Salic Law—The\r\n    short reigns of Philip V. and Charles IV.\r\n\r\nThe history of the modern kingdom of France begins with the break-up of\r\nthe great Karoling Empire in the treaty of Verdun (843). Western\r\nFrancia, split off from the other dominions of Charles the Great,\r\ncontinued for a century to be ruled by his degenerate descendants. But\r\nthe decentralising movement did not stop with the division of the\r\nFrankish Empire into three fairly well-defined units. The dukes and\r\ncounts, who had been provincial governors under Charles the Great, took\r\nadvantage of the growing weakness of the central power to make their\r\nposition hereditary and practically independent. Superficial unity was\r\nonly maintained by the necessity of making head against the attacks of\r\nthe Northmen. The successful resistance of Paris to these invaders gave\r\nto the dukes of Paris, the lords of the Isle de France, the royal title\r\nwhich the Karolings at Laon were too feeble to defend. But the early\r\nkings of the House of Capet were as powerless as their predecessors.\r\nThey themselves belonged to the feudal nobles, they owed the crown to\r\nthe support of their fellows, they were avowedly only _primi inter\r\npares_. Hugh Capet himself acknowledged this when he undertook to do\r\nnothing of importance without consulting the tenants-in-chief. During\r\nthe eleventh century France was little more than a geographical\r\nexpression: its political unity was a mere shadow: its ecclesiastical\r\nunity was independent of the crown. But in the twelfth century two\r\nmovements began [Sidenote: Progress of the French monarchy.] which were\r\ndestined to exert the most decisive influence on the fortunes of France:\r\nthe rise of the communes, and the growth of the royal power. There was\r\nno formal alliance between the crown and the bourgeoisie, but they had\r\nobvious common interests in opposition to the feudal nobles, and they\r\nrendered the most vital assistance to each other. Feudalism, attacked\r\nboth from above and from below, seemed destined to perish. The three\r\nkings who dealt the most fatal blows to aristocratic isolation were\r\nPhilip Augustus (1180-1223), Louis IX. (1226-1270), and Philip IV.\r\n(1285-1314). The third estate rendered its greatest service to the\r\nmonarchy by giving birth to the class of lawyers. To their superior\r\ntraining and their persistent advocacy of the principles of Roman Law\r\nwas due the gradual break-down of feudal jurisdiction. The _cour du\r\nroy_, at first either the court of the royal domain or the court of\r\npeers for the trial of cases concerning tenants-in-chief, became, as the\r\nParliament of Paris, the supreme judicial court for the whole of France.\r\nSide by side with the advance of the central judicial power, another\r\ngreat change was going on—the extension of the royal domain. In the\r\ngreat fiefs female succession was admitted in default of male heirs, and\r\nthis proved fatal to the permanence of many of the old families. With\r\nregard to the crown there was no acknowledged rule of succession,\r\nbecause no occasion for dispute arose. From the accession of Hugh Capet\r\nin 987, to the death of Louis X. in 1316, there was never wanting a son\r\nto succeed to his father. This uninterrupted male succession for so many\r\ngenerations, almost unparalleled among the reigning families of Europe,\r\nwas an invaluable element of strength to the crown in its struggle with\r\nfeudalism. One by one the great fiefs fell in, were conquered, or were\r\nacquired by marriage with heiresses. The most notable successes were the\r\nacquisition of Normandy by Philip Augustus, and of Languedoc after the\r\nAlbigensian crusade. By the time of Philip the Fair the only provinces\r\nwhich retained their feudal independence were the county of Flanders in\r\nthe north, the duchy of Brittany in the west, the duchy of Burgundy in\r\nthe east, and the duchy of Aquitaine in the south. The royal power and\r\nthe territorial unity of France had advanced _pari passu_, and Philip\r\nIV. found himself strong enough to attempt acquisitions beyond the\r\ntraditional frontiers of France.\r\n\r\nSo far—during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries—the tendency towards\r\ncentralisation, in spite of temporary obstacles and checks, had achieved\r\nthat success which usually attends directness and persistence of aim,\r\nand a politic, if sometimes unscrupulous, choice of means. But at the\r\ndeath of Philip IV. this progress was suddenly arrested, and during the\r\nnext two centuries a struggle had to be carried [Sidenote: Difficulties\r\nof the monarchy in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.] on,\r\ndiffering in many respects from that which had gone before, but still\r\ninvolving many of the same problems and ultimately terminating in a\r\nvictory for the same side. One essential factor in this struggle was the\r\ntenure of the duchy of Aquitaine by a foreign prince—the king of\r\nEngland. Obvious interest impelled English kings, like Edward III. and\r\nHenry V., to ally themselves with all the forces of disunion in France,\r\nand their efforts were aided and stimulated by the chance which gave\r\nthem a colourable claim to the French crown. But the difficulties of the\r\nFrench kings of the House of Valois were not due merely to English\r\nintervention. There were two fatal flaws in their own policy and that of\r\ntheir predecessors. (1) While taking every advantage of the movement of\r\nthe lower classes, the kings had done little or nothing to satisfy their\r\nlegitimate aspirations. They gave the lawyers a distinguished position\r\nin the service of the crown, and that was all. Before long, the third\r\nestate was sure to weary of an alliance in which all the substantial\r\nadvantages were on one side; and if the commons were able or willing to\r\nform a coalition with the nobles against the crown, they might impose\r\nchecks upon the royal power similar to those which were enforced by the\r\nEnglish parliament. That this danger was a real one will be seen when we\r\ncome to consider the attitude adopted by the States-General at the time\r\nof the battle of Poitiers.[3] (2) While destroying the old feudal\r\nnobility, the French kings had created a new one. As the great fiefs\r\nfell in, many of them were granted out again as appanages to members of\r\nthe royal family. Doubtless it was considered that blood-relationship\r\nwould be sufficient to unite their interests with those of the monarchy.\r\nBut this proved a complete miscalculation. Relationship counts for very\r\nlittle in politics as against the impulse given by selfish interests.\r\nEdward III. tried a similar policy in England, and it led to the Wars of\r\nthe Roses. In France it led to the long contest of the Burgundians and\r\nArmagnacs, to the _Praguerie_ of 1440, and to the League of the Public\r\nWeal of 1465. The _féodalité apanagée_, as French writers call these\r\nnobles of royal birth in contradistinction to the old _féodalité\r\nterritoriale_, did not long delay to assume the same attitude as their\r\npredecessors, and became the opponents of the monarchy which had created\r\nthem. Their overthrow tasked the devotion of the capable servants of\r\nCharles VII., and gave full employment to the mingled craft and\r\nresolution of Louis XI.\r\n\r\nThe futile expedition to Tunis, the expiring effort of that crusading\r\nimpulse which had urged mediæval Europe to [Sidenote: Philip III.,\r\n1270-1285.] heroic deeds, cost France the life of the noblest of her\r\nlong line of kings. Louis IX. was almost the only French ruler who\r\ncombined the highest moral virtues with eminent political capacity. His\r\nson and successor, Philip III., could claim neither of his father’s\r\ncharacteristics. He was illiterate, and the rashness which earned him\r\nthe name of _le Hardi_ was not redeemed by any clear insight or any\r\nsigns of ability. He was only in name the head of the House of Capet:\r\nthe real master of French policy was his uncle, Charles of Anjou. Paris\r\nlooked for guidance to Naples, rather than Naples to Paris. That the\r\nFrench monarchy continued to advance, in spite of the incapacity of the\r\nking, is a signal proof of its inherent strength and of the ability of\r\nthe trained lawyers who served it. The reign of Philip III., obscure as\r\nit appears at first sight, was marked by the acquisition of three\r\nimportant provinces, of which two remained permanently subject to the\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous victims who perished on the return journey from Tunis\r\nwere Alfonso of Poitiers (August 21, 1271), brother of St. Louis, and\r\nhis wife Jeanne [Sidenote: The Toulouse inheritance.] of Toulouse, the\r\nlast descendant of the famous House of St. Gilles. They left no\r\nchildren, and their vast inheritance, including the counties of\r\nToulouse, Poitou, Auvergne, and the marquisate of Provence,[4] fell to\r\nthe French crown. The only exceptions were the district of Agenais,\r\nwhich was claimed by the English king, and the Venaissin, near Avignon,\r\nwhich was ceded to the Papacy in accordance with the treaty of Meaux in\r\n1229. Thus France completed the absorption of Languedoc, which had been\r\nbegun in the crusade against the Albigenses. It is true that Philip\r\nundertook to rule his new territories as count, and not as king, and\r\nthat he created a special parliament and law-court at Toulouse, but\r\nthese concessions to local independence were only temporary and\r\nillusory.\r\n\r\nIn 1274 occurred another important death, that of Henry, King of Navarre\r\nand Count of Champagne and Brie, leaving [Sidenote: Champagne and\r\nNavarre.] an only daughter, Jeanne, aged three years. The widow, Blanche\r\nof Artois, carried the infant heiress to France and threw herself on the\r\nprotection of the king. Philip at once occupied Champagne and Brie,\r\nwhich were henceforth united to the crown. At the same time he procured\r\na dispensation from Pope Gregory X. for the future marriage of Jeanne to\r\nhis own second son Philip, who soon afterwards became heir to the throne\r\nby the death of his elder brother. The people of Navarre revolted\r\nagainst this high-handed settlement of their fate by a foreign prince,\r\nbut their resistance was crushed by a French army, and Philip assumed\r\nthe government of the kingdom as guardian for his future\r\ndaughter-in-law.\r\n\r\nThese territorial gains were the only notable successes of Philip III.’s\r\nreign, and his remaining years were mainly occupied [Sidenote: Wars with\r\nCastile and Aragon.] with two futile wars in Spain. Alfonso X., formerly\r\nthe claimant of the throne of the Cæsars, was still reigning in Castile,\r\nbut the actual conduct of affairs fell in his old age to his sons,\r\nFerdinand de la Cerda and Sancho. The elder, who had married Philip\r\nIII.’s sister Blanche, died in 1275, leaving two sons. The Castilian\r\nCortes, in regulating the succession, passed over these children, and\r\nsecured the crown on Alfonso’s death to Sancho, who had earned the name\r\nof ‘the Brave’ for his exploits against the Moors. Philip was indignant\r\nat the exclusion of his nephews, and took up arms to support their\r\nclaims. But his invasion of Castile was so reckless and ill-planned as\r\nto gain him the name of _le Hardi_, and he was unable to force a passage\r\nthrough the mountains. His intervention was naturally fruitless, and\r\nSancho succeeded to Castile on his father’s death.\r\n\r\nThe second war was more prolonged. The Sicilian Vespers in 1282 (_v._ p.\r\n25), which resulted in the transfer of Sicily to Peter III. of Aragon,\r\nmade a profound impression in France, and many nobles hurried to offer\r\ntheir services to Charles of Anjou. The Pope excommunicated Peter III.,\r\nand offered the crown of Aragon to Philip III.’s second surviving son,\r\nCharles of Valois, on condition that it should never be united to\r\nFrance. The offer was accepted in 1284, and in the next year Philip\r\nhimself headed a great expedition against Aragon, which was dignified by\r\nthe name of a crusade. The capture of the fortresses of Elna and Girona,\r\nboth after an obstinate resistance, were the only successes of the\r\ncampaign. Roger di Loria with his Catalan sailors destroyed the French\r\nfleet, and cut off the possibility of receiving supplies by sea. At the\r\nsame time disease broke out in the French army. Philip found it\r\nnecessary to retreat, and died at Perpignan [Sidenote: Death of Philip\r\nIII., 1285.] on October 5, 1285. He left three sons: Philip, who in 1284\r\nhad married Jeanne, heiress of Navarre; Charles, Count of Valois and\r\nAlençon, and titular King of Aragon; and Louis, Count of Evreux, whose\r\ndescendants afterwards ruled in Navarre.\r\n\r\nPhilip IV. was seventeen years old when he succeeded his father, and he\r\ndied at the age of forty-seven. In the course [Sidenote: Philip IV.,\r\n1285-1314.] of these thirty years he set a mark upon French life and\r\ngovernment which has never been completely effaced, not even by the\r\nfloods of successive revolutions. Yet our knowledge of his reign, and\r\nespecially of his person and character, is singularly scanty. That he\r\nwas good-looking we know from his being called _le Bel_, but we are not\r\ninformed whether he was tall or short. His character we have to infer\r\nfrom his actions, and we are forced to conclude that it was far less\r\nattractive than his face. This dearth of contemporary records is the\r\nmore notable when it is contrasted with the striking picture which we\r\npossess of his grandfather, and with the wealth of narrative on the\r\nsubject of the fourteenth century wars. Philip was not the man to be the\r\nhero of a Joinville or a Froissart, and no Philippe de Commines had yet\r\narisen. There is little that is heroic or picturesque about his reign.\r\nThe most striking scene, the humiliation of Boniface VIII., is repulsive\r\nin itself and is discreditable to Philip’s memory. It may even be said\r\nthat there was little result to show for his restless activity. The two\r\nenterprises which he had most at heart—the annexation of Aquitaine and\r\nFlanders—ended in failure. His only territorial acquisition of\r\nimportance was Lyons. The suppression of the Templars was not an\r\nachievement to be proud of. A notable victory was gained over the\r\nPapacy, but it was gained by discreditable methods; and, after all, the\r\nresidence at Avignon brought no permanent advantages to France. Philip’s\r\ngreat work lay in the comparatively obscure details of domestic\r\ngovernment, in the improvement and completion of administrative\r\nmachinery, and in the removal of all obstacles in the way of an\r\nefficient despotism. These are achievements which escape the notice of\r\nhistorians who are attracted by the heroes of chivalry, but they produce\r\nfar more definite and deep-seated results than the most brilliant\r\nexploits on the battlefield. It must be admitted that Philip IV. was\r\ncruel and cold-blooded; that his regard for the letter of the law was a\r\nmere disguise for unscrupulousness; that this unscrupulousness was the\r\nmore repulsive for the hypocrisy which could always find pretexts to\r\njustify it; it may even be admitted that his failures in external\r\npolitics outweighed his successes,—yet he must be always memorable as\r\nthe real founder of that administrative centralisation which has ever\r\nsince been the dominant characteristic of the government of France, and\r\nhas been a prominent cause of the subsequent greatness, if also of the\r\nsubsequent disasters, of that country.\r\n\r\nIf this estimate of the reign be correct, it is obvious that we need not\r\nlinger long over Philip’s foreign relations, and that our attention will\r\nbe better devoted to his domestic measures. The war with Aragon, which\r\nhe inherited, never interested him, as the only possible gainers by it\r\nwere his brother and his cousin. After lasting for nearly twenty years,\r\nit ended in the final loss of Sicily by the House of Anjou, and the\r\nabandonment by Charles of Valois of his claims on Aragon on condition\r\nthat his cousin, Charles II. of Naples, should give up to him his\r\nappanages of Anjou and Maine. Before this settlement had been arrived\r\nat, Philip had turned his attention to a far more exciting\r\nenterprise—the attempt to [Sidenote: Wars with England.] wrest Guienne\r\nand Gascony from Edward I. of England. These provinces had been united\r\nto the English crown since the marriage of Henry II. with Eleanor of\r\nAquitaine, and on the whole they were fairly satisfied to remain subject\r\nto their distant ruler, whose island kingdom gave them a convenient\r\nmarket for the produce of their vineyards. But Edward I. had his hands\r\nfull with the suppression of discontent in his recent conquests in\r\nWales, and with enforcing his lately acknowledged suzerainty over\r\nScotland. This gave Philip IV. an opportunity which he was not slow to\r\nseize. Taking advantage of a naval quarrel between some Norman sailors\r\nand the mariners of the Cinque Ports, and of the refusal of the Gascons\r\nto acknowledge the judicial authority of the French courts, Philip\r\nsummoned Edward I. to appear before him to answer for the breach of his\r\nobligations as a vassal (November, 1293). Edward was aware that a\r\ncontumacious attitude towards his suzerain would set a dangerous example\r\nto John Balliol in Scotland, and did all in his power to avoid a\r\nrupture. Unable to go to France in person he sent as a proxy his brother\r\nEdmund, who had married Philip’s mother-in-law, Blanche of Artois. On\r\nthis docile envoy Philip played what can only be described as ‘the\r\nconfidence trick.’ He assured him of his perfect friendliness to\r\nEngland, offered the hand of his sister Margaret to Edward, who was now\r\na widower, and in return he demanded that, as a mere sign of trust and\r\nsubmission, Gascony should be ceded to him for a period of forty days.\r\nEdmund consented; but on the expiration of the time, Philip declared the\r\nEnglish king to be contumacious for not having appeared in person, and\r\nhis troops remained in occupation of the Gascon fortresses. After this\r\nthere was no alternative but war. Edward was at an immense disadvantage.\r\nHe had a war with Scotland and Wales on his hands; his subjects,\r\nespecially the clergy, were discontented at his exactions, and the enemy\r\nwas already in possession of a large part of his territories. His only\r\nally of importance, Adolf of Nassau, was too impotent in Germany to\r\neffect any diversion. On the other hand, Philip offered aid to John\r\nBalliol, and thus laid the foundation of that permanent alliance between\r\nFrance and Scotland which lasted till the reign of Mary Stuart. The\r\nactual hostilities were unimportant, but the balance of success was\r\ndecidedly against the English. It was at this time that Boniface VIII.’s\r\nattempt to interfere led to his first quarrel with Philip IV., and to\r\nthe issue of the bull _Clericis laicos_ (_v._ p. 29). In 1297 the war\r\nassumed a new phase. Edward I. had succeeded in deposing John Balliol\r\nand in conquering Scotland, so that he was now free to take part in the\r\ncontinental war. At the same time he found an ally in Count Guy of\r\nFlanders, who had hitherto been kept passive by Philip’s detention of\r\nhis daughter as a hostage. But Edward was again hampered by quarrels\r\nwith the clergy and the barons, and the latter refused to serve in\r\nGascony if the king persisted in going in person to Flanders. The result\r\nwas that Guienne and Gascony were left defenceless, while Edward and his\r\nFlemish ally were unable to make head against the French. This check and\r\nthe outbreak of a Scotch rebellion under Wallace forced Edward to make\r\novertures for peace, and Philip determined to postpone the annexation of\r\nAquitaine until he had completed the reduction of Flanders. Boniface\r\nVIII. had been compelled by difficulties in Italy to draw closer to the\r\nFrench king, and he had published a modified interpretation of his bull\r\nagainst clerical contributions to secular rulers. He was now allowed to\r\nact as mediator, though Philip protested that he accepted his mediation\r\nas a private person and not as Pope. It was arranged that both parties\r\nshould retain their possessions as they stood until the conclusion of a\r\nfinal settlement. As a security for future peace, Edward I. was to marry\r\nPhilip’s sister, Margaret, and the young Edward of Wales was betrothed\r\nto Philip’s daughter, Isabella. Both kings abandoned their allies (June\r\n30, 1298).\r\n\r\nWhile Edward I. returned to defeat Wallace at the battle of Falkirk,\r\nFlanders was left at Philip’s mercy. The Flemish citizens had no love\r\nfor their count, and would render him no assistance. In this hopeless\r\nposition, Guy [Sidenote: War in Flanders.] was induced by the\r\ntreacherous promises of Charles of Valois to trust to the clemency of\r\nhis suzerain. He was at once thrown into prison, and his fief was\r\ndeclared forfeited to the crown (1300). On his first visit to his new\r\nprovince, Philip’s cupidity was excited by the wealth which he found\r\nthere. His wife, Jeanne of Navarre, exclaimed, when she saw the\r\njewellery of the ladies of Bruges: ‘I thought I was the only queen in\r\nFrance, but I find that here there are six hundred.’ The attempt to\r\ngratify the greed thus aroused was certain to lead to discontent. The\r\nFlemings were as fond of their wealth as they were jealous of their\r\nindependence. They soon discovered that it was better to be oppressed by\r\ntheir count than to be both oppressed and pillaged by their French\r\ngovernor, Jacques de Chatillon. The signal for a general rebellion was\r\ngiven in Bruges, as twenty years before in Palermo, by a massacre of the\r\nFrench. Philip despatched a large feudal army under Robert of Artois to\r\ncrush the insurgents. The French nobles reckoned on an easy victory over\r\nunwarlike and ill-armed citizens, but they were undone by their own\r\nconfidence and recklessness, and were utterly routed in the famous\r\nbattle of Courtrai (July 11, 1302). This was the first of a great series\r\nof battles which taught Europe that an infantry force, if properly led\r\nand handled, could more than hold their own against mounted and heavily\r\naccoutred men-at-arms. It was some time before the lesson was thoroughly\r\nlearned; but when it was mastered, the military system of the Middle\r\nAges collapsed, and with it perished the social organisation which\r\nrested on the invincibility of the knightly force. Philip IV. advanced\r\nin person to recover the lost honour and power of France, but the\r\napproach of winter compelled him to retire without having done anything\r\ntowards the suppression of the rebellion. The great disaster of 1302,\r\nthe first which Philip had yet experienced, came at the crisis of his\r\nquarrel with the Papacy, and forced him to moderate his ambition. In\r\n1303 he concluded a final peace with Edward I. and resigned his\r\nacquisitions in Aquitaine. In 1304, Boniface VIII. being dead, a great\r\neffort was made for the reduction of Flanders. At Mons-en-Puelle (August\r\n18), by carefully avoiding the ruinous mistakes at Courtrai, Philip\r\nsucceeded in defeating the Flemings; but his victory was hardly won, and\r\nwas by no means so decisive as that of his opponents had been. Within\r\nthree weeks the rebels had re-formed their army and were as formidable\r\nand undaunted as ever. Philip found himself compelled to recognise that\r\nhe had undertaken a task beyond his strength, and he hastened to escape\r\nfrom it by concluding a treaty (June, 1305). Robert of Béthune, the\r\neldest son of Count Guy, who had died in prison in 1303, was invested\r\nwith the fiefs of Flanders, Nevers, and Rethel; the Flemings undertook\r\nto pay 200,000 livres to the French king, and to hand over as security\r\nfor the payment Douai, Lille, and other towns on the southern frontier.\r\nIt was long since a French king had suffered such a humiliating check.\r\nIn 1300, Philip seemed to have secured the whole of Flanders and the\r\ngreater part of Aquitaine. Four years later he had lost both provinces.\r\n\r\nPhilip’s relations with the Papacy have been already alluded to (_v._ p.\r\n29). In his quarrel with Boniface VIII. he had substantial justice on\r\nhis side, and the national development of France necessitated an\r\nenergetic resistance to the exorbitant pretensions of the mediæval\r\nPapacy. But these considerations do not justify the brutality of the\r\nFrench soldiery at Anagni, nor the vindictiveness with which Philip\r\npersisted in blackening the character of Boniface after the latter’s\r\ndeath. Equally inexcusable was his treatment of the ill-fated Benedict\r\nXI., though there is no reasonable ground for believing the charge that\r\nPhilip’s agents poisoned the Pope in consequence of his excommunication\r\nof Boniface’s assailants. In Clement V. the king was face to face with a\r\nPope upon whose subservience he had reasonable claims, and who was fully\r\nhis match in diplomatic subtlety and in the want of scruples. The hold\r\nwhich Philip obtained upon the Papacy at this time enabled him to effect\r\nthe blackest action of his reign, the destruction of the Templars. The\r\ncrusades in the East had come to an [Sidenote: Suppression of the\r\nTemplars.] end with the fall of Acre in 1291, and the Orders which had\r\nbeen formed for the defence or conquest of Palestine must inevitably\r\nfall victims to the jealousy which their wealth and independence excited\r\nin Europe, or they must undertake some new task which would justify\r\ntheir existence and give them a renewed hold on the public opinion of\r\nEurope. The Knights of St. John and of the German Order of St. Mary\r\nchose the latter course, and secured a prolongation of their corporate\r\nexistence—the one in Prussia, and the other in the island of Rhodes. The\r\nTemplars, who had been the most prominent in the wars of Palestine, were\r\nthe least prepared to find a new occupation, and their inaction impaled\r\nthem on the other horn of the dilemma. It is needless to go through the\r\nlong catalogue of charges, some horrible and some absurd, which were\r\nbrought by the king’s agents against the Order. It was inevitable that a\r\ncelibate society of warriors should give occasion for the belief that\r\nthe vow of chastity was not always observed. It is credible that in\r\ntheir intercourse with the Saracens many of the knights may have been\r\nled into unbelief, or even to adopt a contemptuous and irreverent\r\nattitude towards Christianity. But it is not credible that the whole\r\nOrder was guilty of the obscenity, blasphemy, and irreligion that were\r\ncharged against its members. Confessions extorted under horrible\r\ntortures and recanted when health and sanity were restored, do not\r\nconstitute evidence from which any reasonable conclusions can be drawn.\r\nBut Philip IV. was deaf to all considerations of justice or of clemency,\r\nand his iron will extorted a condemnation from judicial tribunals and\r\nfrom the Pope. In 1310, after the trial had lasted for two years,\r\nfifty-four knights were burned in Paris, and many other executions\r\nfollowed. In 1312 the Order was formally suppressed, and its possessions\r\ntransferred to the Knights of St. John. This last provision was only\r\nimperfectly fulfilled, and much of the Templars’ hoarded wealth never\r\npassed from the hands of the king. In 1314 the last grand master,\r\nJacques de Molai, after a solemn retractation of all extorted\r\nconfessions, and a denial of the truth of all charges against the Order,\r\nperished at the stake on an island in the Seine.\r\n\r\nPhilip’s last success was an encroachment on those border territories\r\nbetween France and Germany which constituted [Sidenote: Encroachments in\r\nArles.] the obsolete kingdom of Arles. The first step towards their\r\nannexation to France had been taken when Philip III. inherited the\r\nmarquisate of Provence (see above, p. 47). In 1291 Philip IV. had\r\narranged a marriage between his second son, Philip, and Jeanne, daughter\r\nand heiress of Otto IV., Count of Burgundy. This marriage brought\r\nFranche-Comté under French influence, but did not result in the final\r\nannexation of the province, which was not accomplished till the treaty\r\nof Nymegen in 1678. For a long time the city of Lyons and the adjacent\r\nterritory had been objects of French covetousness, and constant quarrels\r\nbetween the archbishop and the citizens offered frequent pretexts for\r\nintervention. At last, in 1312, taking advantage of the Emperor Henry\r\nVII.’s absence in Italy, Philip IV. ventured to take the final step, and\r\nLyons was incorporated with France.\r\n\r\nWe must now turn to Philip IV.’s domestic government, [Sidenote:\r\nDomestic Government.] which constitutes his sole claim to a place\r\namong the great kings of history. His aims were those of his\r\npredecessors—those, in fact, of all kings in the later Middle Ages who\r\nwished to extend their power. He had to destroy feudalism as a basis\r\nof government, or, in the words of a great historian, to ‘eliminate\r\nthe doctrine of tenure from political life.’ The essential vice of the\r\nfeudal system was that every man was directly bound only to the\r\nimmediate lord of whom he held his land; the connection with that\r\nlord’s suzerain was purely indirect. Hence came an inevitable tendency\r\nto disruption; the tie between vassal and lord was stronger than the\r\nindirect tie between the sub-tenant and the king; if a great noble\r\nrebelled he could compel his tenants to follow him even against his\r\nsuzerain. For this system, which had many merits, but was inconsistent\r\nwith either national unity or a strong government, Philip desired to\r\nsubstitute an organisation in which all Frenchmen, whether\r\ntenants-in-chief or sub-tenants, should stand in equal subjection to\r\nthe law and to the king as the source and guardian of the law.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this end, an efficient administrative machinery was\r\nnecessary, and of this the foundations had been laid by Philip’s\r\npredecessors. The country was divided into _bailliages_ in the north and\r\n_sénéchaussées_ in the south. Philip IV. regulated and extended the\r\nfunctions of the bailiffs and seneschals, and employed them not only to\r\ncarry out his edicts in the provinces, but also to supply him with that\r\naccurate local information without which centralisation is useless and\r\nincompetent. Besides these local officials, he [Sidenote: The King’s\r\nCourt.] had the _cour du roi_ which attended his person. This body, the\r\nearliest institution of Capetian France, was originally merely the court\r\nof the king’s domain, and consisted of the household officers and the\r\nimmediate domain tenants. From time to time, however, the king must have\r\nhad to decide questions concerning the great tenants-in-chief, and by\r\nthe essential principle of feudalism such questions must be referred to\r\ntheir equals. Hence arose the court of peers, the creation of which is\r\nassigned by tradition to Philip Augustus when he summoned John of\r\nEngland to answer for the murder of Arthur of Brittany. Whether this\r\ncourt ever had a separate existence from the domain court is difficult\r\nto decide, but if it had, it soon lost it. In the reign of Louis IX. the\r\ndomain court was transformed, when necessary, into a court of peers by\r\nthe addition to it of some of the great vassals. At the same time, the\r\ncourt was made more efficient by the introduction of trained lawyers.\r\nUnder Philip IV. these lawyers became the real managers of the work of\r\njustice and administration; and the nobles, though retaining the right\r\nof attendance, preferred as a rule to absent themselves from business in\r\nwhich their want of legal training placed them at a conspicuous\r\ndisadvantage. The work of the court included all departments of\r\ngovernment: the advising of the king, the management of finance, and the\r\nadministration of justice. And the judicial work was enormously\r\nincreased, partly by the compulsion of the nobles to allow appeals from\r\ntheir local courts to that of the suzerain, and partly by the\r\nreservation of an increasing number of _cas royaux_—_i.e._ cases which\r\nhad to be brought in the first instance before the king. It was\r\nimpossible for one body of men to discharge such a vast mass of\r\nbusiness, and the court was gradually split up into three great\r\ndepartments, which continued, with modifications in detail, to conduct\r\nthe routine administration of France till the Revolution.\r\n\r\n(1) The first of these divisions was the _conseil du roi_, which\r\ncorresponds roughly to the Privy Council in England. It consisted of the\r\ngreat officers of the household with fifteen councillors of state and\r\ntwo or more secretaries. Its chief business was to advise the king in\r\nall affairs of government. Ordinary jurisdiction was delegated to the\r\nParliament, but the council continued to exercise judicial power.\r\nAppeals could in the last instance be made to the king in council, and\r\nhe could evoke cases to it from other courts.\r\n\r\n(2) The _chambre des comptes_ was the financial division of the royal\r\ncourt, and resembles the English Exchequer. It received and audited the\r\naccounts of the bailiffs and seneschals; it had jurisdiction in all\r\nfinancial suits, and it registered all edicts and deeds which concerned\r\nthe domain.\r\n\r\n(3) The most famous of the three bodies was the great law-court of\r\nFrance, the Parliament of Paris. Its functions correspond to those of\r\nthe courts of King’s Bench and Common Pleas in England, but its peculiar\r\nhistory arises from the maintenance of a corporate unity and authority\r\nwhich the English judges never possessed. Philip IV. not only gave to\r\nthe Parliament a separate existence, he also fixed its sessions in\r\nParis, and organised its three earliest sub-divisions. The _chambre des\r\nrequêtes_ decided the lesser cases of first instance brought directly\r\nbefore the Parliament. The _chambre des enquêtes_ received and prepared\r\nfor further consideration all appeals from lower courts. The _grande\r\nchambre_ was the largest and most important of the sub-divisions, and is\r\noften called the Parliament by itself. In it the peers retained the\r\nright of sitting down to the Revolution, but they only appeared on\r\nformal occasions. The _grande chambre_ decided all important appeals,\r\nand cases of first instance concerning the peers, the royal officers,\r\nand the members of the sovereign courts. At first the Parliament only\r\nmet twice a year, at Easter and All Saints. But the two sessions proved\r\ninsufficient to discharge the growing business of the court, and, later\r\nin the century, it was made a permanent court, and its members were\r\nappointed for life or during the royal pleasure. In addition to its\r\njudicial work, the Parliament had to register all royal edicts, treaties\r\nof peace, and other formal documents. This was originally a duty rather\r\nthan a right; and it was not till much later that the Parliament based\r\nupon this practice a claim to remonstrate against, or even to veto, the\r\nedicts of the king.\r\n\r\nThe organisation of this administrative machinery is the greatest\r\nachievement of Philip IV.’s domestic government. [Sidenote: The\r\nStates-General.] But his reign is also noteworthy for the origin of the\r\nStates-General, which at one time promised to become the basis of a\r\nconstitutional system of government such as was our Parliament\r\nestablished in England, but was ultimately crushed into insignificance\r\nby the crown which had created it as a mere instrument to serve its own\r\nends. The first meeting was held in 1302, when Philip wished to parade\r\nthe unanimity of his subjects in opposing the pretensions of Boniface\r\nVIII. They were summoned again in 1308 to condemn the Templars, and in\r\n1314 to support the king in a renewed war with Flanders. Philip may have\r\nfound a model for these assemblies either in the provincial estates of\r\nLanguedoc and Brittany, or in the Cortes of Castile and Aragon, but it\r\nis more than probable that he was inspired by the example of his great\r\ncontemporary, Edward I. of England, who in 1295 had summoned the famous\r\n‘model parliament,’ and had himself in 1301 obtained a protest against\r\nthe papal claims from a parliament at Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe States-General under Philip IV. are especially remarkable for their\r\nnumbers. All tenants-in-chief, whether clerical or lay, were invited to\r\nattend in person, and those who were prevented by any unavoidable cause\r\nmight send proxies. The cathedral chapters and monasteries sent\r\nrepresentatives; and so did all the towns of any size in the kingdom.\r\nThere was no attempt to determine the condition which entitled a man\r\neither to vote or to be elected. The only class which was unrepresented\r\nwas the peasantry. When the States met, they were divided into three\r\nestates: clergy, nobles, and citizens. The meeting only lasted a day,\r\nand there was no general discussion. The royal spokesman explained the\r\nobject for which they were summoned, and then each estate separately\r\ndrew up a document in accordance with the wishes of the king.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the summons of the States-General was not in any way\r\nforced upon the king by external pressure, but was a mere expedient to\r\nstrengthen his hands. The assembly never got rid of this taint on their\r\norigin. If a French king thought his end could be best attained by\r\nsummoning the States-General, he summoned them: but if, on the contrary,\r\nhe thought it advisable to treat separately with the various provinces,\r\nhe did so. Later in the century an attempt was made to secure regular\r\nassemblies with definite authority, but the attempt was a failure, and\r\nparliamentary government was never established in France until the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Philip’s rule is marked by the steady encroachments upon\r\nfeudal independence and privilege of an unscrupulous but efficient\r\ndespotism. He claimed for the crown the right of creating peers, which\r\nhe exercised in favour of Charles II. of Naples and of Robert of Artois.\r\nHe raised to the rank of nobles men who had no qualification either by\r\ndescent or by tenure, and was thus enabled to reward those ministers who\r\nborrowed from Roman Law the phrase, _quod principi placuit legis habet\r\nvigorem_, and coined from it a French legal adage, which the monarchy\r\nmight have taken for its motto: _que veut le roi, si veut la loi_. But\r\nthere was one glaring defect in Philip IV.’s government, which he also\r\nbequeathed to his successors. His financial [Sidenote: Financial\r\nmaladministration.] administration was as incompetent as it was\r\ntyrannical and oppressive. He strained to the utmost the normal sources\r\nof revenue, the income from the domain and the feudal incidents. When\r\nthese were exhausted, he imposed _gabelles_ or taxes on the sale of\r\ncommodities. But these taxes he was foolish enough to farm out to his\r\ncreditors in order to obtain large sums of ready money. Such an\r\nexpedient, especially in early times, always results in loss to the\r\nstate and oppression to the taxpayer. More ruinous, because more\r\ndishonest, was the constant debasement of the coinage, which Philip\r\ncarried to such lengths that contemporaries called him the ‘false\r\ncoiner.’ Thus the founder of the French monarchy was also responsible\r\nfor the defect which ultimately ruined his creation. It is an\r\nextraordinary thing that France, one of the richest countries in Europe,\r\nand in some ways one of the most efficiently governed, never had a sound\r\nfinancial system under the old monarchy. Philip’s successors imitated\r\nthe defects as well as the merits of his rule. To his devices of farming\r\nthe taxes and of debasing the currency they added the disastrous\r\npractice of selling offices, and of increasing their value by granting\r\ntheir holders exemption from taxation. Many Frenchmen saw and deplored\r\nthe evil results of this system, but no one was strong enough to apply a\r\ndrastic remedy. The deficit which resulted was the immediate occasion,\r\nthough not the cause, of the great revolution. It may be fanciful, but\r\nit is not preposterous, to contend that, if Philip IV. had been a\r\ncapable and honest financier, the Bourbons might still be seated on the\r\nthrone of France.\r\n\r\nSuch a harsh government as that of Philip IV. could not possibly be\r\npopular. His direct attack upon their [Sidenote: Death of Philip IV.]\r\ninterests exasperated the _noblesse_, and his financial extortions\r\nalienated the _bourgeoisie_. In 1314 a new war broke out with Flanders,\r\nand Philip attempted to defray its expense by a heavy tax upon all\r\ncommodities, to be levied on their sale, from both seller and purchaser.\r\nThis caused an explosion, and for the first and only time nobles and\r\nthird estate were leagued together against the king. Such an alliance\r\nthreatened to ruin the monarchy, and Philip was forced to yield. He\r\nabolished the tax, and promised to redress the grievances of his\r\nsubjects as regards the coinage. Soon after this humiliation he died\r\n(November 29, 1314).\r\n\r\nDuring the next fourteen years Philip’s three sons ruled in rapid\r\nsuccession, and their reigns are chiefly notable for [Sidenote: Louis\r\nX., 1314-16.] the establishment of the all-important rule of succession\r\nwhich excluded females from the succession to the French throne. The\r\neldest, Louis X., was only twenty-four years old at his father’s death,\r\nand took no interest in the work of government. The conduct of affairs\r\nwas allowed to fall into the hands of his uncle, Charles of Valois, who\r\nhad always sympathised with the feudal opposition to Philip IV. The\r\ntriumph of the reactionary party was seen in the trial and execution of\r\nEnguerrand de Marigny, one of the chief advisers of the late king. But\r\nthe nobles, freed for the moment from royal domination, were\r\nshort-sighted enough to throw over their recent alliance with the\r\nbourgeoisie, and thus lost an excellent chance of imposing permanent\r\nrestrictions upon the power of the crown. The concessions which they\r\nobtained were solely in the interests of their own class, and even they\r\nwere not national concessions but were embodied in a series of\r\nprovincial charters. The absence of national unity, to which these\r\nevents testified, was a cause of the ultimate victory of the monarchy,\r\nwhich had never again to face such a hostile union of classes as had\r\nbeen formed for the moment in 1314.\r\n\r\nApart from this momentary victory of the feudal nobles, the reign of\r\nLouis X. is absolutely uneventful. He got rid of his first wife,\r\nMargaret of Burgundy, in order that he might marry Clementia, sister of\r\nCarobert of Hungary. He also undertook an expedition to Flanders in\r\norder to force the Count to observe his treaty obligations; but the\r\ncampaign was wholly unsuccessful, and soon afterwards the young king\r\ndied, on June 5, 1316. His death was more [Sidenote: Succession question\r\nin 1316.] important than his life, as it gave rise to the first doubtful\r\nsuccession since the reign of Hugh Capet. For the first time for more\r\nthan three centuries there was no male heir to the crown, as Louis only\r\nleft a daughter, Jeanne, the offspring of his first marriage. As the\r\nquestion of female succession had never arisen before, there was no rule\r\nto decide either way. But the problem in this case was further\r\ncomplicated by the fact that Clementia, Louis’s second wife, was\r\nexpecting a child to be born five months after her husband’s death.\r\nUntil this event took place nothing could be settled, and during the\r\nnecessary interregnum the regency was naturally intrusted to Philip, the\r\nelder brother of the late king. Meanwhile the interests of Jeanne were\r\nmaintained by her maternal uncle, Eudes IV. of Burgundy, with whom\r\nPhilip concluded a treaty. This provided that if Clementia gave birth to\r\na son he should succeed to the whole inheritance, but if the posthumous\r\nchild were a daughter, then Jeanne was to have Navarre, Champagne, and\r\nBrie until she was of marriageable age, when she was to choose whether\r\nto renounce the crown of France or to demand a formal consideration of\r\nher claims.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1316, Louis X.’s widow gave birth to a son, who is reckoned\r\nin the list of French kings as John I. The child was born on a Sunday,\r\nand died on the following Friday. Thus the claims of Jeanne were left in\r\nfull force, but they were seriously prejudiced by the fact that during\r\nthe previous five months her uncle had obtained a firm hold of the reins\r\nof government, which he was by no means prepared to resign. The Duke of\r\nBurgundy was bribed to abandon the cause of Jeanne by a marriage with\r\nPhilip’s daughter, and by the gift of Franche-Comté and 500,000 crowns\r\nas his bride’s dowry. The French lawyers, sharing the general prejudice\r\nagainst female rule, which resulted from so long a period of male\r\nsuccession, hunted out a clause in the laws of the Salian Franks which\r\nforbade [Sidenote: The so-called Salic Law.] the inheritance by women of\r\n_terra Salica_. This clause they arbitrarily applied to the crown, and\r\nthus coined the famous expression, the Salic Law. But it must never be\r\nforgotten that the exclusion of women from the throne of France rests,\r\nnot upon any ancient rule, but upon the precedent of Jeanne’s exclusion\r\nin 1316, followed and confirmed by further exclusions in 1322 and 1328.\r\n\r\nOnce securely established on the throne, Philip V. showed [Sidenote:\r\nPhilip V., 1316-22.] himself a resolute and able ruler. The reaction in\r\nfavour of feudal independence was checked; the lawyers recovered their\r\nascendency in the royal counsels; and the administrative machinery of\r\nPhilip IV. was once more set in working order. Numerous assemblies were\r\nheld, in which the third estate was fully represented; and a vigorous\r\nattempt was made to improve trade, and to check provincial isolation by\r\nestablishing uniformity in coinage, weights, and measures. But Philip\r\ndid not live long enough to carry out designs which, if successful,\r\nmight have given him a place among the great administrators of France.\r\nHe died in 1322 leaving only daughters, and his brother Charles IV. had\r\nlittle difficulty in seizing, not only the throne, [Sidenote: Charles\r\nIV., 1322-28.] but also Navarre, Champagne, and Brie, which ought to\r\nhave been left in the hands of Jeanne. The reign of Charles is of little\r\nimportance except in connection with England, where Edward II. was\r\ndeposed and murdered by a conspiracy headed by his faithless wife and\r\nCharles’s sister, Isabella of France. To his nephew, the young Edward\r\nIII., Charles handed over Guienne, but retained the district of Agen, to\r\nbe the source of future disputes. With Charles IV.’s death (January 31,\r\n1328) the main line of the House of Capet came to an end. There was\r\nstill one doubt as to the rule or custom of succession. That women could\r\nnot themselves hold the crown had been settled by three successive\r\nprecedents within twelve years. But could they transmit a claim to their\r\nmale descendants? There were in 1328 two possible claimants on this\r\nground—Philip, the son of Eudes IV. of Burgundy by a daughter of Philip\r\nV., and Edward III. of England, whose mother was a sister of the three\r\nlast kings. But France was not likely to adopt a rule of succession\r\nwhich might at any moment give the crown to a foreign prince. And so the\r\ncrown passed to the nearest male heir, Philip of Valois.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  See below, chap. iv., pp. 81-88.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Since 1125 Provence had been divided into two parts: (1) the county,\r\n  south of the Durance, which was given to the family of Bérenger, and\r\n  passed, with the hand of their heiress Beatrice, to Charles I. of\r\n  Anjou and Naples; (2) the marquisate, between the Durance, the Isère,\r\n  the Alps, and the Rhône, which was held by the counts of Toulouse, and\r\n  was brought by Jeanne to her husband, Alfonso of Poitiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n                FRANCE UNDER THE EARLY VALOIS, 1328-1380\r\n\r\n\r\n    The accession of Philip of Valois—His relations with Navarre and\r\n    England—Robert of Artois—Philip’s action in Gascony, Scotland, and\r\n    Flanders brings on War with England—Edward III. and Jacob van\r\n    Artevelde—Edward III. claims the French Crown—Beginning of the\r\n    Hundred Years’ War—English Expedition into Picardy—The succession in\r\n    Brittany followed by a war—The Murder of Artevelde—The battle of\r\n    Crecy and siege of Calais—Annexation of Dauphiné to France—Accession\r\n    of King John and renewal of the war with England—Battle of\r\n    Poitiers—Etienne Marcel and the States-General of 1355 and 1357—The\r\n    Ordinance of March 3, 1357—Anarchy in France—The Murder of the\r\n    Marshals—Royalist reaction—The Jacquerie—The Murder of Marcel and\r\n    the capture of Paris—English Invasion of 1359 followed by the Treaty\r\n    of Bretigni—The succession to Burgundy—Charles V/’s\r\n    Government—Success of his policy in Brittany and Spain—The\r\n    reconquest of the English Provinces—Last years of Charles V/—Du\r\n    Guesclin and de Clisson.\r\n\r\nThe first result of the accession of Philip VI. was the severance\r\n[Sidenote: Accession of Philip of Valois, 1328.] of the crowns of France\r\nand Navarre, which had been united since the marriage of Philip the Fair\r\n(see p. 48). Navarre was now given up to Jeanne, the daughter of Louis\r\nX., and her husband, Philip of Evreux. In return Jeanne abandoned all\r\nother claims, either to the French crown or to the provinces of\r\nChampagne and Brie. By this bargain Philip secured his throne against\r\none possible claimant, and confirmed the exclusion of female succession\r\nin France. Another rival, Edward III. of England, who could contend that\r\nfemales might transmit a claim to a male heir, was not at the moment\r\nvery formidable. He was very young, he had obtained the throne through\r\nhis father’s deposition in 1327, and for the time he was under the\r\ntutelage of his mother Isabella and her paramour Mortimer. So far from\r\nputting forward a claim to the French crown, Edward III. came over to\r\nAmiens in 1329, and recognised Philip VI. by doing homage to him for his\r\ninherited possessions in Aquitaine.\r\n\r\nSo confident was Philip in the strength of his position that he did not\r\nhesitate to provoke enemies both at home and abroad, and this\r\nrecklessness ultimately led to a quarrel with England, and to the\r\noutbreak of a war which lasted more than a hundred years, and exercised\r\nthe most decisive influence upon the development of both nations. Among\r\nthe nobles who had contributed most to bring about Philip VI.’s\r\naccession was his brother-in-law, Robert of Artois. He was a grandson of\r\nCount Robert of [Sidenote: Robert of Artois.] Artois, who had fallen in\r\nthe battle of Courtrai in 1302. In spite of the normal preference for\r\nmale succession, the grandson had been excluded in favour of his aunt\r\nMatilda, whose daughter Jeanne had married Philip V. Robert had made\r\nseveral efforts to vindicate his claim to Artois, but without success.\r\nOn the accession of Philip VI., however, he was confident of obtaining\r\njustice, and at once commenced a suit for the purpose of proving that\r\nthe inheritance had been unlawfully withheld from him. Matilda and\r\nJeanne came to Paris to defend their rights, and both of them died\r\nwithin a short interval of each other, not without strong suspicions of\r\nfoul play. Their claims now passed to Margaret, the daughter of Jeanne\r\nand Philip V. Robert of Artois found himself accused, not only of\r\nemploying poison to rid himself of his rivals, but also of forging\r\ndocuments in support of his claims, and of employing magic arts against\r\nthe king himself. His supposed accomplices were tortured into some sort\r\nof confession, and Robert, finding that he had lost the royal favour on\r\nwhich he had reckoned, fled from the court. The suit was decided against\r\nhim (1332), and he himself sentenced to banishment. He found a refuge in\r\nEngland, and in his eagerness for revenge set himself to urge Edward\r\nIII. to claim the French throne on the ground of his mother’s descent\r\nfrom Philip IV.\r\n\r\nEdward III. might have paid little attention to such obviously\r\ninterested advice had not events elsewhere brought him into hostile\r\nrelations with France. Philip VI. was suspected, with some justice, of\r\ndesiring to imitate his uncle’s policy in Gascony, and to bring that\r\nprovince directly under his rule. More serious still was his conduct in\r\nregard to [Sidenote: War in Scotland.] Scotland. The treaty of\r\nNorthampton in 1328, by which the independence of Scotland had been\r\nrecognised, had stipulated for the restoration of their lands to those\r\nnobles who had supported England in the war. Robert Bruce died in 1329\r\nwithout carrying out this part of the treaty, and the nobles who ruled\r\nduring the minority of his son David were not likely to give up\r\npossessions which had fallen into their own hands. The dispossessed\r\nnobles determined to maintain their own cause in arms, and a successful\r\nbattle at Dupplin Moor enabled them to place Edward Balliol upon the\r\nScottish throne. Edward III. had given no aid to this expedition, but\r\nnow that the revolution was accomplished, he was willing to profit by it\r\nand to receive Edward Balliol’s homage. But the partisans of David Bruce\r\nrallied from their first defeat and drove Balliol from the throne.\r\nEdward III. now led an army into Scotland, won the battle of Halidon\r\nHill (1333), captured Berwick, and restored Balliol. The result was a\r\nrenewal of the Scottish war, and the party of independence appealed for\r\naid to France. Philip VI. did not hesitate to secure such a useful ally\r\nin case of future difficulties with England. French troops were\r\ndespatched to Scotland, and the safety of the young Scottish king was\r\nsecured by sending him to France. From this time may be dated the\r\npermanent alliance between France and Scotland, which was at once a\r\ngrievance and a source of serious embarrassment to English rulers.\r\n\r\nEnglish and French troops were now fighting each other as auxiliaries on\r\nScottish soil, and it was obvious that the two countries must soon be\r\ninvolved in open strife. The final impulse was supplied by events in\r\nFlanders. In the fourteenth [Sidenote: Flanders.] century Flanders was\r\nthe most important trading and manufacturing country in western Europe.\r\nGhent was the Manchester, and Bruges the Liverpool, of that day. In\r\nBruges we are told that merchants from seventeen kingdoms had settled\r\nhomes, while strangers journeyed thither from all parts of the known\r\nworld. It was the great centre-point of mediæval commerce, where the\r\nproducts of north, south, and east were brought together and exchanged\r\nagainst each other. Still more important to the Flemings themselves and\r\nto their relations with England was the manufacture of wool. England\r\nproduced the longest and finest wool, which was woven into cloth and\r\nworsted on the looms of Ghent and Ypres. With France, on the other hand,\r\nthe relations of the Flemings were purely political. The Count of\r\nFlanders, who found his subjects very difficult to govern, was the\r\nvassal of the French king, and his authority could hardly be maintained\r\nwithout the aid of his suzerain. To the material interests of the\r\nFlemings France was almost wholly alien. France, as contrasted with the\r\nother states of Europe, was little affected by the commercial spirit of\r\nthe age. While Edward III. and the Black Prince, who appear in the pages\r\nof Froissart as mirrors of chivalry, were yet sufficiently practical to\r\nencourage the industrial interests of their subjects, the Valois kings\r\npursued a totally different policy. They crushed industry by excessive\r\nand ill-judged imposts. They maintained no police to give safety to the\r\nforeign merchant, and foreign wares were kept out of France by the\r\ninsecurity of the roads and the heavy duties upon imports. This\r\ndifference is paralleled by the difference in the military system of the\r\ntwo countries. The English king, supported by the growing wealth of his\r\nsubjects, was able to leave the majority of his people at home, and to\r\nmake war with a well-paid and equipped mercenary army. The King of\r\nFrance, after extorting all he could wring from the pockets of his\r\nsubjects, compelled them to serve in the old feudal array, and led them\r\nto be butchered by opponents who were numerically inferior, but had been\r\ntrained to war, and were not distracted from the work before them by the\r\nsense that they were neglecting their material interests at home.\r\n\r\nPhilip VI. had been involved in a Flemish war at the very beginning of\r\nhis reign. The citizens of West Flanders, headed by Bruges and Ypres,\r\nrose in revolt against their Count, Lewis, who appealed for aid to the\r\nFrench king. A feudal army was led to his assistance, and the citizens,\r\nweakened by the abstention of Ghent, were crushed at the battle of\r\nCassel (1328). The Flemings had to suffer, not only for their\r\nunsuccessful rebellion, but also for their previous victory at Courtrai,\r\nwhich had now been so ruinously reversed. Their leaders were mercilessly\r\nhunted to death, the town charters were confiscated, and their\r\nfortifications razed to the ground. The authority of the count was\r\nrestored, but he was more than ever the dependent vassal of the French\r\nking. In 1336, at the command of Philip VI., he ordered the imprisonment\r\nof all Englishmen in Flanders. Edward III. promptly retaliated by\r\nprohibiting the exportation of English wool and the import of foreign\r\ncloth. Flemish artisans were induced to emigrate to England, and to lay\r\nthe foundations of a prosperous woollen manufacture in Norfolk.\r\n\r\nThese events, which may be taken as the actual origin of the hundred\r\nyears’ war, illustrate the folly and recklessness of [Sidenote: Alliance\r\nof England with the Flemings.] Philip VI. So far his quarrel with Edward\r\nIII. in Aquitaine and in Scotland had been a personal quarrel; and the\r\nEnglish people, though reluctant to lose the profitable trade with\r\nBordeaux, were by no means enthusiastic either for the continental\r\ndominions of their king, or even for the establishment of his suzerainty\r\nover Scotland. But to strike at English trade with Flanders was to\r\ninflict a mortal blow at the most sensitive of English interests. From\r\nthis time the quarrel with France became a national as well as a royal\r\nquarrel, and Edward could count upon the unanimous support of his\r\nsubjects. Still more serious was the effect of Philip’s action in\r\nFlanders. In the fourteenth century, as in the Napoleonic wars at the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, England had the stronger position\r\nin a trade dispute with the Continent. The Flemish market was important\r\nto England, but English wool was indispensable to Flanders. The\r\nreprisals of Edward III., forced upon him by the action of the French\r\nking, threatened the Flemings with the ruin of their most important\r\nindustry. A new rising, more formidable than that of 1328, was at once\r\nplanned. Ghent, which had then held aloof, was now prepared to play its\r\npart; and in Ghent arose a leader, Jacob van [Sidenote: Jacob van\r\nArtevelde.] Artevelde, whose eloquence and decision gave him for a time\r\npractical omnipotence, while his guidance gave to the movement a unity\r\nand consistency which previous rebellions had too often lacked. His\r\navowed object was to restore the supply of wool to the Flemish looms,\r\nand for this purpose to establish friendly relations with England. He\r\nassembled at Ghent the men of the chief cities, and ‘showed them that\r\nthey could not live without the King of England; for all Flanders was\r\nsupported by cloth-making, and without wool one could not make cloth;\r\ntherefore he urged them to keep the English king their friend.’ At the\r\nsame time he was anxious to avoid any needless infraction of feudal law,\r\nand therefore suggested that Edward should claim the French crown,\r\npointing out that the Flemings could not lawfully serve the King of\r\nEngland against the King of France, but that they could serve the lawful\r\nKing of France against the usurper.\r\n\r\nEdward III. saw that war was inevitable; and the arguments of Artevelde\r\nconvinced him, if any conviction were needed, [Sidenote: Edward III.\r\nclaims the French crown.] that by putting forward a claim to the crown\r\nhe would gain powerful supporters, and in the end more substantial\r\nadvantages. In 1337 he published his claim before a parliament, and set\r\nto work to form continental alliances. The Emperor, Lewis the Bavarian,\r\nindignant at Philip’s dictation to the Pope, Benedict XII., was willing\r\nto support the English king. In September, 1338, he met Edward at\r\nCoblentz, and formally invested him with the office of imperial vicar in\r\nthe provinces on the left bank of the Rhine. The Duke of Brabant and\r\nseveral other princes of the Netherlands were persuaded or bribed to\r\npromise contingents to the English army. Edward’s position seemed to be\r\nof overwhelming strength. He could attack France on both sides, from\r\nFlanders and Artois on the north-east, and from Guienne and Gascony on\r\nthe south-west.\r\n\r\nBut the English successes were by no means so great as had been\r\nconfidently expected. Edward’s first expedition [Sidenote: Opening of\r\nhostilities.] into Picardy in 1339 was a complete failure. The Emperor,\r\nvacillating as ever, would give no effective aid, the Flemings were\r\ncontent with the recovery of the wool supply, and it was only the\r\nsluggishness of Philip VI. which enabled the English forces to retire\r\nwithout serious loss. In 1340 the enterprise was renewed. A French and\r\nGenoese fleet had been collected off Sluys to dispute the landing. The\r\nGenoese commander refused to fight in a position which made it\r\nimpossible to manœuvre, and left the French vessels to be utterly\r\ndestroyed in the first important encounter of the war. But this naval\r\nvictory was the solitary triumph of the campaign. Although the Flemings,\r\nunder the influence of Artevelde, gave more active assistance than in\r\nthe previous year, Edward was repulsed from the walls of St. Omer and\r\nTournai. In September he concluded a truce for nine months with Philip\r\nVI. The only gainers by the war were the Flemings, who had practically\r\nabrogated the authority of their count, and had organised an independent\r\nfederation of communes.\r\n\r\nIt seemed for the moment as if the war might collapse altogether in\r\n1340. Edward’s allies had either deserted him or were obviously lukewarm\r\nin his cause. He had spent vast sums of money without having any\r\nsubstantial result to show for it. His subjects were discontented, and\r\nEdward chose this moment for a violent quarrel with his chief minister,\r\nArchbishop Stratford, who was backed up by the English parliament. But\r\nthe dwindling flames of the war were rekindled into a blaze by a quarrel\r\nabout the succession in Brittany. Duke John III. died in 1340,\r\n[Sidenote: Succession quarrel in Brittany.] leaving no children. Of his\r\ntwo brothers, the elder was dead, but had left a daughter, Jeanne, who\r\nwas married to Charles of Blois, a nephew of Philip VI. The younger\r\nbrother was John de Montfort, who claimed the vacant duchy as the\r\nnearest male heir. The Count of Blois appealed, on behalf of his wife,\r\nto the Parliament of Paris, and that court decided in her favour. The\r\nresult was a civil war between the French and the Celtic population of\r\nBrittany, the Celts supporting de Montfort and rejecting the rule of\r\nCharles of Blois as an alien. Philip VI. determined to support the cause\r\nof his nephew and the decision of his parliament. De Montfort crossed\r\nover to England and recognised Edward III. by doing homage to him for\r\nBrittany. Thus in the case of Brittany, as in that of Artois, the two\r\nkings were committed to principles which ran counter to their own\r\nclaims. The French king, who owed his crown to the so-called Salic\r\nlaw,[5] appeared as the champion of female succession; while Edward\r\nIII., who claimed to be King of France through his mother, contended for\r\nthe exclusive right of the male heir.\r\n\r\nThe war in Brittany offered to Edward III. ‘the finest [Sidenote: War in\r\nBrittany.] possible entry for the conquest of the kingdom of France,’\r\nbut his intervention served rather to prolong than to decide the\r\nstruggle. Charles of Blois, with the aid of John of Normandy, the heir\r\nto the French crown, began by gaining important successes. Nantes was\r\ncaptured, and John de Montfort sent prisoner to Paris. But the heroic\r\nCountess of Montfort, a sister of the Count of Flanders, supported her\r\nhusband’s cause with masculine energy and courage, and the arrival of\r\nEnglish succour restored the balance of forces in Brittany. But Edward\r\nIII. still found himself confronted by superior numbers, and in 1343\r\npapal mediation succeeded in arranging a general truce for three years.\r\nThe truce, however, was not allowed to run its full term. John de\r\nMontfort escaped from his prison, and the severity with which Philip VI.\r\npunished some nobles in Brittany and Normandy for suspected treason led\r\nto a renewal of hostilities in 1345. Edward III. determined to make\r\ngreater efforts than ever, and to attack France on three sides—from\r\nGuienne, Brittany, and Flanders. In Guienne Henry of Lancaster gained a\r\nconsiderable victory at Auberoche, and captured several fortresses which\r\nwere held by the French. In Brittany John de Montfort died, leaving his\r\nclaims to his son, and his death prevented any important operations from\r\nbeing undertaken. Meanwhile Edward himself prepared to co-operate with\r\nthe Flemings on the north-east. But his plans were interrupted by what\r\nappeared to be a great disaster to his cause. Jacob van Artevelde had\r\nincurred the distrust of his fellow-citizens. [Sidenote: Murder of\r\nArtevelde.] He had found it increasingly difficult to reconcile the\r\njarring pretensions of the rival cities, or to compose the jealous\r\ndivisions of the fullers and weavers of Ghent. In his alliance with\r\nEngland he had gone further than the majority of the Flemings desired.\r\nThey would have been content to impose conditions upon their count,\r\nwhereas Artevelde had schemed to depose him altogether, and to transfer\r\nthe direct government of Flanders to the Prince of Wales. But the final\r\naccusation against the once popular leader was that he had placed the\r\ngreat treasure of Flanders at the disposal of the English king. In a\r\nrising of the infuriated mob, Artevelde’s house was stormed and he\r\nhimself slain. For the moment Edward feared that he might lose his hold\r\nupon Flanders. But Artevelde’s policy survived him. The Flemings were\r\nnot prepared to make unconditional submission to their count, and to\r\nextort conditions the alliance with England must be maintained. They\r\nhastened to excuse their conduct to the English king, to assure him of\r\nthe continuance of their support. But Edward had received the news of\r\nanother loss, which checked his advance in 1345. This was the death of\r\nhis brother-in-law, William IV. of Holland, Hainault, and Zealand. As he\r\nleft no children, his territories were seized by Lewis the Bavarian and\r\nconferred upon one of his younger sons (see p. 108). The Emperor had\r\nalready deserted the English alliance, and the establishment of the\r\nHouse of Wittelsbach in the dominions of William IV. broke up the\r\ncoalition which Edward III. had formed on the borders of France.\r\n\r\nThese checks induced Edward, not to relax his efforts, but to alter his\r\nplans. The military interest of 1346 seemed likely to [Sidenote:\r\nCampaign of 1346.] be concentrated in the south-west. A large French\r\narmy under Philip’s eldest son, John of Normandy, entered Guienne,\r\nrecovered many of the places lost in the previous year, and besieged the\r\ninferior English troops in Aiguillon. Edward III. collected a large army\r\nat Southampton, and set sail on July 2. His intention was to land at\r\nBordeaux, and march to the relief of Aiguillon. But his voyage was\r\nhindered by storms, and the advice of some of his French followers\r\ninduced him to make for the coast of Normandy. The province was wholly\r\nunprepared for attack, and the English met with little resistance on\r\ntheir devastating march. Along the valley of the Seine they advanced as\r\nfar as Poissi, where the flames of the burning houses were seen from the\r\nwalls of Paris. Meanwhile, Philip VI. had strained every nerve to\r\ncollect a second army for the defence of his capital. Among the allies\r\nwho came to his aid were John of Bohemia and the newly elected King of\r\nthe Romans, Charles IV. But Edward declined to assault Paris, or to face\r\nan army which was now larger than his own. Misleading Philip by a feint\r\nin the direction of Tours, he crossed the Seine at Poissi, and marched\r\nat full speed towards Picardy, in order to effect a junction with the\r\nFlemings. Philip followed with his enormous force, and the destruction\r\nof the bridges over the Somme seemed to shut the English in a trap. But\r\na captured peasant guided Edward to a comparatively unguarded ford at\r\nBlanche Taque, and the French arrived just as the last of the enemy had\r\ncrossed. The battle, however, was only postponed, though the crossing of\r\nthe river enabled Edward to choose his own ground, instead of fighting\r\nat a disadvantage with an impassable river behind him. To continue the\r\nretreat with an exhausted army pursued by superior numbers must have\r\nended in disaster, and Edward drew up his troops at Crecy, near\r\nAbbeville, [Sidenote: Battle of Crecy, 1346.] to try the hazard of the\r\nfirst pitched battle of the war. The result was to teach the world a\r\nlesson in the art of warfare which had only been imperfectly suggested\r\nby the battles of Stirling Bridge, Bannockburn, and Courtrai. It was a\r\ncombat of infantry against cavalry, of missile weapons against heavy\r\narmour and lances, of trained professional soldiers against a\r\ncombination of foreign mercenaries with disorderly feudal levies. And\r\nthe inevitable result was made the more decisive by the utter want of\r\ngeneralship on the part of the French king. Obeying a momentary impulse\r\nof rage, he ordered his troops to engage when they were exhausted by a\r\nlong march. The Genoese crossbows were wetted by rain, and their bolts\r\nfell harmless, while they were exposed to a hail of arrows from the\r\nEnglish longbows. Then the men-at-arms charged over the unfortunate\r\nGenoese, and were already in disorder before they could reach the enemy.\r\nThere was individual prowess in plenty, but no organisation or\r\ndiscipline, and the bravest of the assailants only rushed upon a certain\r\nfate. Philip fled in despair, but the King of Bohemia, the Counts of\r\nFlanders and Alençon, and many lesser princes and nobles, were left dead\r\nupon the field. Edward III. made no attempt to turn back upon France. It\r\nwould have been difficult for him to feed his soldiers in a district\r\nwhich had been already swept bare by the requisitions and the pillage of\r\ntwo great armies. After allowing three days for rest and the burying of\r\nthe dead, he continued his march northwards, and laid siege to Calais.\r\nHis victory had decisive results both in the west and the south. The\r\nsiege of Aiguillon was raised, and the retirement of the Duke of\r\nNormandy left Guienne at the mercy of the English. Henry of Lancaster\r\nrecovered the places lost at the beginning of the year, and, entering\r\nPoitou, took and sacked Poitiers. In Brittany the French cause met with\r\nalmost equal disasters. Charles of Blois was captured and carried a\r\nprisoner to England, and, though his wife continued the struggle, the\r\nparty of de Montfort had for a time a secure predominance. To complete\r\nthe list of failures, an attempted diversion by David of Scotland, who\r\ninvaded England in the autumn of 1346, ended in the king’s defeat and\r\ncapture at the battle of Nevill’s Cross.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Edward III. was engaged in the blockade of Calais, where Jean\r\nde Vienne held out with heroic obstinacy [Sidenote: Siege of Calais,\r\n1346-7.] for nearly a whole year. The death of Lewis of Flanders at\r\nCrecy seemed to open the prospect of a reconciliation of the Flemings\r\nwith France, and if this could have been effected, the siege would\r\nprobably have ended in failure. The young Count, Lewis de Mâle, had done\r\nnothing to incur the enmity of his subjects, and they welcomed his\r\nreturn with enthusiasm. But in their treaty with Edward III. the\r\nFlemings had agreed that their new ruler should marry an English\r\nprincess. This stipulation Lewis refused to fulfil, and when the\r\ncitizens tried to coerce him, he escaped from subjects who had become\r\nhis gaolers and returned to the French court. His departure left the\r\nFlemings bound to the English alliance, and to Philip VI.’s lavish\r\noffers of bribes they turned a deaf ear. The siege could only be raised\r\nby force, and Philip collected an army for that purpose. But when he\r\napproached he found the English too strongly entrenched, and retired\r\nwithout risking a battle. Thus, deprived of all hope of succour from\r\noutside, the defenders were forced to accept Edward’s terms, and to hand\r\nover the town, with six of the principal burghers, to his mercy. The\r\nburghers were spared on the entreaty of Queen Philippa, but the whole\r\npopulation of Calais was expelled to make room for English settlers.\r\nGradually, as Edward’s wrath at the prolonged resistance died away, some\r\nof the original inhabitants were allowed to return, but the population\r\nof Calais continued to be preponderantly English during the two\r\ncenturies that it remained subject to England.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Calais was the last military disaster of Philip VI.’s reign.\r\nBoth England and France were exhausted by the strain of the contest, and\r\nthe outbreak of the terrible Black Death, which ravaged western Europe\r\nin 1348 and 1349, diverted men’s minds from international quarrels. A\r\ntruce, originally concluded for ten months, was prolonged by mutual\r\nconsent for several years. Philip concluded his reign in peace, and\r\nbefore his death (August 22, 1350) he was able to add an important\r\nprovince to France, and thus to gain some consolation for the losses\r\n[Sidenote: Dauphiné annexed to France.] of the English war. Among the\r\nlargest fragments of the old kingdoms of Arles was Dauphiné, ruled as a\r\nfief of the Empire by the Dauphins of Vienne. The last of these princes,\r\nHumbert, had supported Lewis the Bavarian in his struggles against\r\nFrance and the Avignon Popes. But like so many of the Emperor’s allies,\r\nhe was alienated by Lewis’s weakness and selfishness, and pecuniary\r\ntroubles forced him to change his policy and to draw closer to France.\r\nIn 1343 he concluded a treaty with Philip VI. by which Dauphiné, in\r\ndefault of lawful issue to himself, was to fall to a younger son of the\r\nFrench king. In the next year this treaty was modified to secure the\r\ninheritance to the heirs to the French crown; and finally in 1349\r\nHumbert’s life-interest in the province was bought out by payment of a\r\nlarge sum, and Dauphiné was handed over to the House of Valois, and in\r\nthe course of the next generation became the regular appanage of the\r\neldest son of the reigning king. About the same time, France acquired\r\nanother advantage on the side of Flanders. In 1348 Lewis de Mâle\r\nrecovered his county, and by encouraging internal quarrels among his\r\nsubjects, he not only evaded the hated obligation of an English\r\nmarriage, but also restored some measure of authority over the turbulent\r\nFlemings. As long as his power could be maintained, it might be hoped\r\nthat France would escape the dangers of Flemish co-operation with the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nJohn the Good, as he is called by the caprice of historical\r\nnomenclature, was no better a ruler than his father, and was even more\r\nunfortunate. He had already been active both in military and civil\r\naffairs, but had [Sidenote: Accession of King John, 1350.] profited\r\nlittle by his experience. War, in his eyes, was nothing but a tournament\r\non a large scale. Of orderly finance he had no conception; and as to the\r\nwelfare of his subjects he had neither interest nor insight. He was a\r\nreckless spendthrift, imbued with the chivalrous ideals of the day, and\r\nsubject to sudden gusts of passion, alternating with fitful and\r\nuncalculating acts of generosity. His accession marks the appearance on\r\nthe scene of a new generation of actors. The Black Death had been most\r\nfatal to the lower classes, but it had by no means spared those of\r\nhigher rank. In a single year John had lost his mother, Jeanne of\r\nBurgundy; his first wife, the sister of Charles IV.; his uncle Eudes\r\nIV., who had added Franche-Comté to the duchy of Burgundy, and now left\r\nboth Burgundies to an infant grandson, Philip de Rouvre; and his cousin,\r\nJeanne of Navarre, whose kingdom and possessions in France passed to her\r\nson, deservedly known in history as Charles the Bad, and destined to be\r\nthe evil genius of France in the hour of her worst misfortunes. In\r\nEngland there had been a similar clearance of prominent personages.\r\nEdward III. still lived, but he played little further part in the French\r\nwar, where his place was taken by the Black Prince.\r\n\r\nThe truce with England expired in 1351, but for some years the revived\r\nhostilities were only local and unimportant. So great was the mutual\r\nexhaustion of the two states, that the new Pope, Innocent VI., elected\r\nin 1352, almost succeeded in negotiating a general peace. But, as\r\nbefore, it was internal disturbances in France which led to a renewal of\r\nthe war. Charles of Navarre had been invested with the county of Evreux\r\nand with the large possessions of his [Sidenote: Renewed war with the\r\nEnglish.] mother in Normandy and the Ile-de-France. He had also received\r\nin 1352 the hand of the king’s daughter, Jeanne. But his ambition was\r\nstill unsatisfied, and John took no further pains to conciliate a prince\r\nwho could advance claims to Champagne and Brie, and might, under\r\nfavourable circumstances, become a rival candidate for the crown. In\r\n1354 the king’s favourite, Charles of Spain, was assassinated by the\r\nemissaries of the King of Navarre. John was induced to pardon his\r\nson-in-law; but the reconciliation was only hollow, and Charles was\r\nimpelled by real or imaginary grievances to open negotiations with\r\nEdward III. The English king could not resist the temptation of invading\r\nFrance with the aid of so powerful an ally, and prepared to enter\r\nNormandy through Calais in 1355. This danger compelled John once more to\r\nmake overtures to his rebellious son-in-law, and Edward found himself\r\ndeprived of the promised aid. He landed at Calais, ravaged the\r\nneighbouring districts, and then withdrew to repel a Scottish invasion.\r\nThe Black Prince was more successful. Starting from Bordeaux, he marched\r\nthrough Languedoc, treating that province as Edward III. had treated\r\nNormandy in 1346. But the French king was as reckless as ever. Early in\r\n1356 he surprised Charles of Navarre as he was banqueting with the\r\nDauphin at Rouen, put his chief supporters to death, and carried the\r\nking a prisoner to Paris. The result of this violent act was to excite\r\ngeneral disaffection. Charles’s brother, Philip of Navarre, promptly\r\ntook up arms, and appealed for English support. The Black Prince was not\r\nslow to respond. His plan was to march northward through the most\r\nfertile districts of France, cross the Loire, and advance through Maine\r\nto join the rebels in Normandy. But his force was insufficient for such\r\nan enterprise. John hastily collected an army, the Loire valley was\r\nblocked, and Prince Edward had to retire before vastly superior numbers.\r\n\r\nJohn hurried eagerly in pursuit, and actually reached Poitiers before\r\nthe enemy. A battle was now inevitable. So hopeless [Sidenote: Battle of\r\nPoitiers, 1356.] were the odds that the Black Prince was willing to\r\naccept any honourable terms, but John declined to let the enemy escape.\r\nAll the advantages, however, of superior numbers were thrown away by the\r\negregious folly of the French king. He sent a small detachment of\r\nmen-at-arms to attack the English position on the hill, while he ordered\r\nthe bulk of his army to dismount on the plain. The men-at-arms, who had\r\nto advance by a narrow lane under the arrows of the English archers,\r\nwere speedily routed, and the English cavalry followed up this success\r\nby butchering the dismounted host, who could neither stand their charge\r\nnor fly. The king, after fighting bravely to the last, was taken\r\nprisoner with his youngest son Philip, and the flower of the French\r\nnobility either shared his captivity or escaped it only by death on the\r\nfield. As at Crecy, the English made no attempt to profit by their\r\nvictory. The Black Prince was content to carry his illustrious prisoner\r\nto Bordeaux, whence he subsequently despatched him to London.\r\n\r\nThe crushing defeat at Poitiers and the captivity of the king marked the\r\nclimax of a long series of disasters, of which [Sidenote: Discontent in\r\nFrance.] the cause was to be sought in the continued maladministration\r\nof French kings and ministers. No country could be brought into such a\r\nplight as that to which France was reduced without giving rise to\r\nserious and dangerous discontent, and this discontent had already found\r\nexpression before the campaign of 1356. From 1350 to 1355 frequent\r\nassemblies of local estates had been held for the raising of supplies,\r\nand these had not been voted without ominous grumbling and demands for\r\nredress of grievances. At last, in November 1355, King John had found it\r\nnecessary to convoke the States-General of Languedoil, [Sidenote:\r\nStates-General of 1355.] in order to deliberate on the best mode of\r\nresisting the national foes. The ‘deputies of the three estates’—for\r\nnobles and clergy could only attend when elected by their order—met in\r\nParis on November 30. The orator of the third estate, in the formal\r\nreply to the chancellor’s opening speech, was Etienne Marcel, provost of\r\nthe merchants in Paris, and for the next four years one of the most\r\nimportant men in France. After deliberating on the matters submitted to\r\nthem, the States drew up the great ordinance of December 28, 1355. They\r\ngranted to the king a _gabelle_ upon salt, and a tax of eight deniers\r\nthe pound on the sale of all commodities. These are to be levied upon\r\nall classes—clergy, nobles, non-nobles, and even the members of the\r\nroyal family. The collection of the taxes is to be superintended by\r\ndelegates chosen by the estates, and the expenditure is to be controlled\r\nby a council of nine, three from each estate. Purveyance and the\r\narbitrary alteration of the money-standard were forbidden. Finally, the\r\ndates were fixed for two subsequent sessions—one in March and the other\r\nin November of the next year.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the States-General acted, whether consciously or\r\nunconsciously, in imitation of the English Parliament, and took\r\nadvantage of the financial difficulties of the crown to impose\r\nconstitutional checks upon the royal power. But, unfortunately, the\r\nfinancial skill of the estates was by no means equal to [Sidenote:\r\nFinancial blunders of the States.] the importance of their objects, or\r\nto their energy in striving after them. The _gabelle_ on salt has in all\r\nages been the most unpopular tax in France, and the tax upon sales\r\nbreaks all the canons of taxation which modern economists have agreed to\r\naccept. Great disaffection was excited by the attempt to collect the\r\ntax, and in some provinces serious disturbances took place. When the\r\nStates-General met in March they yielded at once to the expression of\r\npublic opinion, repealed the obnoxious taxes, and imposed in their place\r\nan extraordinary income-tax, which was so adjusted that the percentage\r\nincreased as the income diminished. After taking steps to control the\r\ncollection and expenditure of the revenue, the estates adjourned till\r\nMay 6. They then discovered that the amount raised was wholly\r\ninsufficient to defray the necessary expenditure, and in their ignorance\r\nand perplexity they reimposed the unpopular taxes on salt and sales, and\r\nordered the levy in June and August of two extra charges upon incomes.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Poitiers matters seemed more hopeless than ever. The\r\nking’s eldest son, Charles,[6] assumed the government on his father’s\r\nimprisonment, but he displayed little of the wisdom or capacity for\r\nwhich he was afterwards renowned. His first act was to convene the\r\nStates-General [Sidenote: States-General of Oct. 1356.] on October 17.\r\nThe assembly was unusually large, the third estate being represented by\r\nexceptional numbers. Of the nobles, however, the attendance was very\r\nsmall. Large numbers of them had perished at Poitiers, and the survivors\r\nwere discredited. Thus the balance of classes, so necessary for the\r\nsuccess of constitutional changes, was overthrown. The third estate\r\nbecame preponderant in the assembly, and its leader, Marcel, obtained\r\nconsiderable support from the clergy through his ally Robert Lecoq,\r\nBishop of Laon. The demands of the estates were far more extreme than\r\nthose of the earlier assemblies. They were no longer content to impose\r\nchecks upon the government, but determined to take it into their own\r\nhands. The royal ministers were to be dismissed, and thirty-six\r\ndelegates—twelve from each estate—were to be appointed to manage the\r\naffairs of the kingdom. At the same time, outspoken complaints were made\r\nof the failure to carry out promised reforms, especially in the matter\r\nof the coinage, and the release of the King of Navarre was demanded. But\r\nthe Dauphin, encouraged by the grant of a considerable subsidy from the\r\nestates of Languedoc, was not prepared to hand over his authority to the\r\nStates-General. He prorogued the assembly, endeavoured to raise money\r\nfrom the provincial estates, and even ventured on a new debasement of\r\nthe currency. The reforming party was driven by this obstinacy to\r\nrevolutionary methods. The mob rose in Paris, and Marcel ordered the\r\nroyal officials to cease minting the inferior coins. The Dauphin, who\r\nhad gone to Metz to demand the mediation of Charles IV. with England,\r\nreturned to find his capital in open revolt. Unable to resist the\r\npopular demands, he was forced to hold a new meeting of the\r\nStates-General on February 5, and to accept the ordinance which they\r\ndrew up of March 3, 1357. In [Sidenote: Ordinance of March 3, 1357.]\r\nthis the policy which had been proposed in the earlier session was\r\ncarried out, and the royal power was subordinated to that of the States.\r\nThe commission of thirty-six was definitely appointed to superintend\r\nevery branch of the administration. An aid was granted for the\r\nmaintenance of 3000 men-at-arms, but it was to be collected and spent,\r\nnot by royal officials, but by nominees of the States. The predominance\r\nof the third estate is conspicuous in the articles directed against the\r\nnobles. They were forbidden to carry on private wars, and if they\r\ndisregarded the prohibition, the local authorities or the people might\r\narrest them and compel them to desist by fines or imprisonment. Not only\r\nwas purveyance forbidden, but it was permitted to the people to assemble\r\nat the ringing of a bell, and to oppose its collectors by force.\r\n\r\nKing John, who was about to start from Bordeaux to London, sent a\r\nmessage to Paris to annul an ordinance which dealt so shrewd a blow at\r\nthe royal authority. But the Parisians were not prepared to submit to a\r\ndistant and captive king, the Dauphin was forced to promulgate the\r\nordinance, and the revolution in the government of France was completed.\r\n[Sidenote: Anarchy in France.] The thirty-six showed their power by\r\npurging the royal council and the magistracy of all who were suspected\r\nof hostility to the popular party. But any hopes that the change of\r\nrulers would bring prosperity to France were doomed to disappointment.\r\nThe revolutionary government was no more successful than that which it\r\nhad superseded. The provinces were not prepared to submit to the\r\ndictation of Paris, and their discontent encouraged the Dauphin to wait\r\nfor an opportunity of recovering power. The nobles became more and more\r\nindignant at the predominance of the bourgeois. The English, still\r\nexulting in their triumph of the previous year, were content to accept a\r\ntruce for two years; but the mercenary troops, deprived of their\r\nlegitimate occupation, wandered about the country pillaging or levying\r\nblackmail on the people. Conscious that their position was insecure, and\r\nthat the Dauphin might at any moment become actively hostile, Marcel and\r\nhis associates endeavoured to secure a powerful ally by releasing\r\nCharles of Navarre (November, 1357). The only result was to kindle a\r\ncivil war. The Dauphin had been compelled to promise the restoration of\r\nall his cousin’s possessions, but his lieutenants would not give up the\r\nstrong places, and Charles the Bad took up arms. For the moment he was\r\nthe ally of the bourgeois, but he had no real sympathy with the cause of\r\nreform, and sought to fish in troubled waters for his own gain. The\r\ndisasters of the ruling dynasty seemed to offer him a fair chance of\r\nestablishing a right to the throne. In his speeches to the people he was\r\ncareful to point out that his own claim was much stronger than that of\r\nEdward III.\r\n\r\nAs the reforming movement became weaker and more discredited, it began\r\nto adopt more violent and revolutionary methods. The career of Marcel is\r\nmarked by increasing narrowness and selfishness. He had begun by\r\nadvocating measures for the regeneration of France, then he had become\r\nthe champion of the third estate; within that estate he was driven to\r\nmaintain the preponderance of Paris and its mob; and at last he had to\r\nfight in Paris for his own personal ascendency. At the beginning of 1358\r\nhis adherents adopted as their ensign a red and blue cap. The Dauphin\r\nwas raising an army against the King of Navarre, and had recalled many\r\nof his former ministers. A new exhibition of mob violence was necessary\r\nto intimidate him into submission. Marcel forced his way into the\r\nLouvre, [Sidenote: Murder of the marshals.] where the marshals of\r\nNormandy and Champagne were murdered in their master’s presence. The\r\nunfortunate prince fell on his knees to beg for his own life, and had to\r\nsubmit to the indignity of wearing the parti-coloured cap, which was\r\nplaced on his head by Marcel himself. For the moment this deplorable act\r\nseemed to have achieved its end. The Dauphin was cowed into submission;\r\nhis unpopular advisers were dismissed, and Charles of Navarre was\r\nadmitted to Paris and formally reconciled with his cousin.\r\n\r\nBut the murder of the marshals was really as impolitic as it was\r\ncriminal. The open dictation of the mob, and the failure of the\r\nbourgeois government to remedy the misfortunes of France, provoked a\r\nviolent reaction in [Sidenote: Royalist reaction.] favour of the\r\nmonarchy which had been so insultingly defied. With fatal\r\nself-confidence Marcel allowed the Dauphin, who now assumed the title of\r\nregent, to leave Paris and to throw himself upon the loyalty of the\r\nprovinces. Charles summoned the States-General to meet in May 1358, at\r\nCompiègne instead of in Paris. The meeting was not very numerous, but it\r\nexpressed the prevalent sentiment of France in favour of royalty. Marcel\r\nendeavoured to strengthen himself by forming a league of towns for the\r\nmaintenance of common interests, but it was only joined by the towns in\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood of Paris. Civil war was inevitable, and the\r\nnew fortifications which Marcel had built to protect the capital against\r\nEnglish attack were now to be employed for the defence of the citizens\r\nagainst their fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\nAt this critical moment the evils of France were suddenly multiplied by\r\nthe rising of a class for which neither king, nobles, nor citizens had\r\ndone anything. The [Sidenote: The Jacquerie.] serfs or villeins of\r\nFrance had suffered terrible hardships within the last decade. Their\r\nnumbers had been decimated by the Black Death, and the survivors had to\r\nadd to their own tasks the work of those who had perished. Their\r\nhard-won savings had been wrung from them to pay the ransom of their\r\nlords, who had fallen into the hands of the English at Poitiers or\r\nelsewhere. The lands from which they extracted a scanty living were\r\ndevastated by the mercenary soldiers in peace as well as in war.\r\nDespairing of redress, they determined, at any rate, to avenge their\r\nsufferings. The story of their revolt is one of almost unredeemed\r\nhorror. It began in the district of Beauvais, and rapidly spread over\r\nChampagne, Picardy, and the Ile-de-France. Castles were burned; men,\r\nwomen, and even children were tortured and put to death. But the nobles\r\nsoon recovered from the first panic, and took arms against enemies whom\r\nthey now loathed as much as they had previously despised them. The\r\nill-armed peasants were unable to face the trained men-at-arms, and the\r\nsuppression of the revolt was as murderous and destructive as its\r\noutbreak.\r\n\r\nThere was little real sympathy between peasants and bourgeois. They had,\r\nit is true, a common enemy in the nobles, and Marcel had tried to use\r\nthe Jacquerie as a diversion in his own favour. But he gave no efficient\r\naid to his allies, and his half-hearted connection only brought upon\r\nhimself the discredit and disaster of their ruinous defeat. From the\r\nvictorious troops of the nobles the regent was able to form an army for\r\nthe reduction of his rebellious capital. The citizens were bellicose,\r\nbut they were not warlike, and it was necessary to bring trained troops\r\nto [Sidenote: Siege of Paris.] the aid of their undisciplined valour.\r\nCharles of Navarre was appointed captain-general of Paris, and brought a\r\nmercenary army for its defence. But the king’s aims were as purely\r\nselfish as ever. While professing to defend the city, he was negotiating\r\nwith the regent for its surrender. Such proceedings excited serious\r\nmistrust, which was increased by quarrels between the citizens and the\r\nsoldiers of Navarre. At last the king left Paris for St. Denis, and\r\nfurther resistance seemed almost hopeless. The citizens were willing to\r\nmake terms, but the Dauphin would not negotiate with the murderer of the\r\nmarshals. Marcel felt that in such a dilemma he could no longer trust\r\nhis followers. A party was already formed within the city which was\r\nhostile to his continued ascendency, and in favour of restoring the\r\nroyal authority. If the citizens had to choose between their own safety\r\nand the interests of their provost, their choice could not be long\r\ndelayed. There was only one apparent means of escape, and Marcel\r\nclutched at it. He offered to surrender Paris to Charles of Navarre, and\r\nto proclaim him King of France. But on the very night when this\r\ntreacherous design was to be carried out, Marcel was assassinated by one\r\nof his [Sidenote: Murder of Marcel.] own followers (July 31, 1358). It\r\nis easy to see and condemn the errors of his later career, but his name\r\nwill always be memorable in French history as the leader of the most\r\nnotable attempt, before 1789, to give to France a constitutional form of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nTwo days after the death of Marcel the regent Charles entered Paris, and\r\nthe restoration of the royal authority was signalised by the severe\r\npunishment of its chief opponents. In the next year Charles bought off\r\nthe King of Navarre, who had lost all hopes of gaining the crown with\r\nthe collapse of the bourgeois revolution. There still remained the war\r\nwith England. During the truce John had been negotiating for his\r\nrelease, and in 1359 he agreed to the cession of nearly the whole of\r\nnorthern and western France. But the Dauphin was of opinion that the\r\nmutilation of his inheritance was too high a price to pay for his\r\nfather’s liberty. He convened the States-General, now the docile\r\ninstrument of the prince whose authority had been so recently defied by\r\nits predecessors. The so-called treaty of London was unanimously\r\nrejected, and Edward III. had no alternative but to renew the war. He\r\ncollected an enormous army for the invasion of France in October, 1359.\r\nBut the Dauphin had learned a lesson from experience, and would fight no\r\nmore battles like Crecy and Poitiers. The English army [Sidenote:\r\nEnglish invasion, 1359.] advanced to Rheims, but found the city too\r\nstrongly defended. An attack upon Burgundy was repelled, not by arms,\r\nbut by the payment of a large sum of money. Edward marched against\r\nParis, but the Dauphin refused to quit the shelter of the walls, and the\r\ninvaders had to turn westwards to Chartres. The country had been so\r\ndesolated by war and pestilence that it was difficult to feed the army,\r\nthe season was wet and unfavourable, and Edward III., finding that his\r\narmy was wasting away without gaining any success, agreed to negotiate.\r\nBy the treaty of Bretigni (May 8, 1360) he renounced [Sidenote: Treaty\r\nof Bretigni.] his claims to the French throne and to the Norman and\r\nPlantagenet provinces north of the Loire. In return he was to enjoy full\r\nsovereignty, without any homage to the French king, in his own conquest\r\nof Calais, and in the possessions which Eleanor had brought to Henry\r\nII., viz. Guienne, Gascony, Poitou, Saintonge, and a number of smaller\r\nterritories. France was to renounce the Scottish, and England the\r\nFlemish alliance. The ransom of King John was fixed at three million\r\ncrowns, to be paid in six yearly instalments. On receipt of the first\r\ninstalment the king was to be released, but hostages were to be given\r\nfor the payment of the remainder. It was not easy to raise the ransom\r\nfrom exhausted France; but Galeazzo Visconti was opportunely willing to\r\npay six hundred thousand gold florins to gain for his son the hand of a\r\nFrench princess, and this bargain with the Milanese despot enabled John\r\nto return to his kingdom. He seems, however, to have found the cares of\r\ngovernment a disagreeable burden after the comparative gaiety of his\r\nimprisonment in London. In 1363 his second son, Louis of Anjou, escaped\r\nfrom Calais, whither he had gone as one of his father’s hostages. John\r\nseized the opportunity to parade a chivalrous regard for his plighted\r\nword, and at the same time to abandon duties which had become difficult\r\nand distasteful. Leaving the regency once more to his eldest son, he\r\nsailed to England in January 1364, and died in London three months\r\nlater. Before his departure he had done one act which is of cardinal\r\nimportance in the history of France. In 1361 a return of the plague had\r\ncarried off Philip de Rouvre, the childless ruler of Burgundy,\r\nFranche-Comté, and Artois. The two latter provinces, which had come to\r\nPhilip through the female line, passed to Margaret of Flanders, but the\r\nduchy [Sidenote: Duchy of Burgundy.] of Burgundy escheated to the crown.\r\nA prudent king would have retained the direct rule of so valuable a\r\npossession; but John, with reckless generosity, gave it away to his\r\nfourth son Philip, who had fought boldly by his side at Poitiers, and\r\nhad shared his captivity. This Philip the Bold is the founder of the\r\ngreat line of the Valois Dukes of Burgundy.\r\n\r\nThe new king, Charles V., had been the practical ruler of France since\r\nthe battle of Poitiers. During those eight years [Sidenote: Government\r\nof Charles V.] he had learned from harsh experience many lessons which\r\nstood him in good stead when circumstances enabled him to gain some\r\nsuccess. The very weakness of his bodily health, which contemporaries\r\nattributed to poison administered by Charles of Navarre during their\r\nearly friendship, debarred him from the active exercises of chivalry,\r\nand impelled him to cultivate his mental faculties. Fragile, timid, a\r\nstranger to the joys of the tournament and the battle-field, he seems\r\nstrangely out of place in the days of the Black Prince and Bertrand du\r\nGuesclin, of John Chandos and the Captal de Buch. Yet Charles V. is the\r\ngreatest of the Valois kings before Louis XI., and must be reckoned\r\namong the founders of modern France. His chief task was to restore the\r\ndespotic power of the crown, which had been so rudely shaken between\r\n1355 and 1358. Arbitrary taxation was to supersede the grant of supplies\r\nby the estates; military and civil officials were to be royal nominees;\r\neven the local assessors and collectors of taxes were to be under the\r\nsupervision and control of the crown. Only once did the States-General\r\nmeet during the reign, and then they were summoned merely to strengthen\r\nthe king’s hands. But the despotism of Charles V. was a capable and\r\norderly government, wholly different from that of his predecessors. It\r\nis curious to note how this absolute king adopts and turns to his own\r\nadvantage the expedients of his enemies. He reimposed the _gabelle_ on\r\nsalt, and the _aides_ or taxes on the sale of commodities, the two\r\nfinancial expedients of the States of 1355. He retained the _élus_, the\r\nlocal collectors whom the States had nominated to levy these charges,\r\nthough he was careful to take their appointment into his own hands. He\r\ngave tardy expression to the will of the estates by putting an end to\r\nthe debasement of the currency, the worst of all grievances, and by\r\nimposing strict limitations on the right of purveyance. When his\r\nbrother, Louis of Anjou, provoked discontent by his brutal\r\nadministration in Languedoc, Charles did not hesitate to dismiss him\r\nfrom the governorship, and to grant redress to the complainants. Such a\r\ngovernment was a great and a novel boon in the fourteenth century, and\r\nit is only on its financial side that it is open to hostile criticism.\r\nThe expenses, both civil and military, were enormous, and the people\r\nwere subjected to a heavier burden of taxation than they had ever\r\nexperienced before. And the taxes were not only excessive in amount and\r\narbitrary in their imposition, they were also oppressive and unequal. To\r\nincrease the receipts from the _gabelle_, Charles V. introduced the\r\npractice of requiring every family to purchase at least a fixed amount\r\nof salt from the royal granaries; and the principle of equality, which\r\nis enjoined in his ordinances, was infringed by the frequent grant or\r\nsale of exemptions, sometimes to a class, sometimes to a district or a\r\ncorporation. It is these exemptions, multiplied as time goes on, which\r\nmake the financial system of France, down to the Revolution, so unjust,\r\nso disorderly, and so inefficient. And Charles V. was also responsible\r\nfor a disastrous innovation. His predecessors had received a revenue\r\nfrom customs duties levied on the frontiers of their kingdom. Charles\r\nwas the first to hamper domestic trade by imposing customs on the\r\ntransit from one province to another.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of these drawbacks the administration of Charles V. was\r\neminently successful, and it was this success which led his subjects to\r\napprove, or even to welcome, the [Sidenote: The French welcome absolute\r\nrule.] arbitrary character of his rule. A people which had suffered from\r\nevery kind of misfortune, from foreign invasion, pestilence, and civil\r\nstrife, as the French had done in the middle of the fourteenth century,\r\nis never very eager to limit the power of a capable ruler. What it needs\r\nis a government which will maintain order at home, and retrieve the\r\nnational honour by victories over foreign foes; and to such a government\r\nmuch will be forgiven. If the English had reason to approve the personal\r\nrule of the Tudor sovereigns, the French a century earlier had\r\ninfinitely more reason to support a king who gratified their most\r\nimperious desires. For not only did Charles V. remedy the most glaring\r\ndefects of his predecessors’ administration, but this most unmilitary of\r\nkings was able to gain triumphs over the hated English which a few years\r\nbefore must have seemed impossible.\r\n\r\nThe first opportunity for an indirect renewal of the strife with England\r\nwas offered by affairs in Brittany. The treaty [Sidenote: War in\r\nBrittany.] of Bretigni had left unsettled the long struggle between John\r\nde Montfort and Charles of Blois, and England and France were not\r\npledged to abandon the cause of their respective candidates. In the very\r\nyear of his accession Charles V. determined to strike a vigorous blow in\r\nfavour of the House of Blois, and sent Bertrand du Guesclin, whose\r\nmilitary genius he had already detected, to lead a considerable force\r\ninto Brittany. But this first enterprise was not crowned with success.\r\nThe superior discipline of the English mercenaries enabled them to gain\r\na decisive victory in the hard-fought battle of Aurai (September 29,\r\n1364). Charles of Blois was slain, and Bertrand du Guesclin was left a\r\nprisoner in the hands of John Chandos. To prevent a complete transfer of\r\nthe allegiance of Brittany to the English king Charles V. found it\r\nnecessary to negotiate, and in April, 1365, John de Montfort was\r\nrecognised as duke, with the proviso that if he died without male issue\r\nthe duchy should pass to the eldest son of Charles of Blois.\r\n\r\nMore important in its ultimate results was French intervention in\r\nCastile. The government of Peter the Cruel had excited the bitter enmity\r\nof his subjects, who [Sidenote: War in Castile.] found a champion in the\r\nking’s bastard half-brother, Henry of Trastamara. Henry appealed for aid\r\nto France, and Charles V. welcomed the opportunity to rid his country of\r\nthe hated free companies. Bertrand du Guesclin, who had been ransomed\r\nfrom his captors, raised an army among these professional soldiers, and\r\ncrossed the Pyrenees at the end of 1365. The task of the invaders was\r\nfacilitated by a general revolt of the Castilians. Henry of Trastamara\r\nwas crowned king, and Peter fled to Bordeaux to implore English\r\nassistance. The Black Prince was conscious that French ascendency in the\r\nSpanish peninsula threatened his duchy of Aquitaine, and chivalrous\r\nmotives impelled him to support a legitimate king against a usurper.\r\nPeter made the most lavish promises of pay to his auxiliaries, and the\r\nBlack Prince became surety for the good faith of his guest. In 1367 all\r\npreparations were complete, and the treacherous Charles of Navarre gave\r\na passage through his kingdom to the invaders. Between Najara and\r\nNavarrette, not far from the later battle-field of Vittoria, a complete\r\nvictory was won over the French and Castilian forces. Du Guesclin was\r\nonce more a captive, Peter the Cruel recovered his crown, and Henry of\r\nTrastamara had to seek safety in exile. But Peter proved to be as\r\nfaithless as he was cruel. He declined to fulfil his promises to allies\r\nwho seemed to be no longer necessary, and the English prince was in\r\ngreat straits to satisfy the soldiers who had trusted in his surety. To\r\nmake matters worse the troops were wasted with disease, and the Black\r\nPrince himself contracted a fever which remained in his blood and led to\r\nhis early death. With his temper embittered and his health broken, he\r\nled the remnants of his army back to Gascony. His departure was followed\r\nby a new revolution in Castile. Henry of Trastamara returned to reclaim\r\nthe crown, and du Guesclin, whom the Black Prince imprudently allowed to\r\npay a second ransom, once more entered his service. In 1369 the French\r\ntroops won the battle of Montiel, and in a personal interview which\r\nfollowed Peter was stabbed to the heart by his half-brother. Thus all\r\nthe fruits of the battle of Najara were lost, and a king was seated in\r\nCastile who was pledged to the French alliance.\r\n\r\nThese events in Castile encouraged Charles V. to carry out a\r\nlong-cherished design for the reconquest of the English [Sidenote:\r\nRenewal of English war.] provinces. A pretext for a rupture was found in\r\nthe discontent which was excited in Aquitaine by the heavy taxes levied\r\nby the Black Prince to defray the expenses of his Spanish expedition. In\r\n1368 several of the Gascon nobles, regardless of the treaty of Bretigni,\r\nappealed to Charles V., as their suzerain, to redress their grievances.\r\nCharles delayed a final rupture until he had made his preparations, and\r\nhad heard of the triumph of his ally in Castile. In 1369 he summoned the\r\nBlack Prince to appear in Paris to answer the complaints of his subjects\r\nbefore the court of peers. Edward replied grimly that he would willingly\r\ngo to Paris, but with sixty thousand men in his company. It was easier,\r\nhowever, to utter the threat than to carry it out. The conditions which\r\nhad enabled the English to gain some conspicuous successes in the\r\nearlier war were now altered, and to some extent reversed. The wise\r\ngovernment of Charles V. had already removed many of the administrative\r\nevils which had crippled France under his grandfather and his father.\r\nThanks to du Guesclin, the French king could now put into the field a\r\nprofessional army under capable leaders, in place of the disorderly\r\nfeudal levies which had been cut to pieces at Crecy and Poitiers. The\r\nBlack Prince was no longer the active and resolute commander that he had\r\nshown himself before his illness, and he lost some of his most capable\r\nlieutenants, notably Chandos, who died in 1370. The provinces ceded at\r\nBretigni had had some years’ experience of English rule, and their\r\ndiscontent was stimulated by a growing sense of national sympathy with\r\nthe rest of France. Another very prominent cause of the reversal of\r\nmilitary success in the years following 1369 is to be found in the\r\ncautious tactics deliberately adopted and enforced by Charles V.\r\nhimself. For an invading army victory is imperatively necessary; for the\r\ndefenders it is enough not to be defeated. Charles forbade his generals,\r\nno matter what provocation they received, to risk an engagement in the\r\nopen field. They were to shut their troops in the strong towns, and to\r\nleave the English armies to be wasted by disease, by want of provisions,\r\nand by the difficulty of coercing a [Sidenote: English disasters.]\r\nhostile population. As the invaders departed, the French could harass\r\ntheir march, cut off stragglers and supplies, and occupy the territory\r\nwhich the enemy was compelled to evacuate. These tactics were eminently\r\nsuccessful, and they were immensely aided by the support of the\r\nCastilian fleet, which enabled the French to gain a temporary naval\r\nascendency. This deprived the English of direct communication with the\r\ncoast of Aquitaine, and forced them to carry on military operations at a\r\ndisastrous distance from their ultimate base of supplies. Almost the\r\nonly English success was the capture of Limoges in 1370 by the Black\r\nPrince, who blackened his own reputation by ordering an indiscriminate\r\nmassacre of the inhabitants. Soon afterwards he was compelled by illness\r\nto return to England, and to resign his duchy of Aquitaine, which he\r\nnever revisited. In 1372 the English fleet, which was carrying an army\r\nunder the Earl of Pembroke to Bordeaux, was destroyed off La Rochelle by\r\nthe combined naval forces of France and Castile. A new and larger force\r\nwas prepared in 1373 under John of Gaunt, but in consequence of this\r\nmaritime disaster it was necessary to land the troops at Calais. Thence\r\nJohn of Gaunt marched right across France, but he found no enemy to beat\r\nin the field, and he could not take a single fortress. Meanwhile his\r\ntroops melted away through desertion, disease, and famine. A defeated\r\narmy could hardly have been in a more lamentable condition than that of\r\nwhich a scanty and impoverished remnant succeeded in reaching Bordeaux.\r\nThe failure of this great effort on the part of England was decisive.\r\nAlready several provinces had been practically lost, and by 1374, of all\r\nthe vast possessions which had been gained at Bretigni, there remained\r\nonly Calais in the north, and the strip of land stretching from Bordeaux\r\nto Bayonne. In 1375 the Pope succeeded in negotiating a truce for two\r\nyears, and before its expiry both the Black Prince and Edward III. had\r\ndied, and England, bitterly chagrined at such complete and unexpected\r\ndisasters, had passed under the rule of a child.\r\n\r\nIn 1378 hostilities were resumed, though the English wished to prolong\r\nthe truce, and it seemed almost inevitable that Charles V. would\r\ncomplete his task of expelling [Sidenote: Last years of Charles V.] the\r\nforeigner from French soil. The English had no longer any allies in\r\nFrance. John de Montfort, who had clung to his old protectors ever since\r\nthe outbreak of war in 1369, had been expelled from Brittany, which was\r\nnow almost wholly occupied by royal troops. Charles of Navarre, who had\r\nbeen a traitor to both sides in turn, discovered his mistake in allowing\r\nthe English power to be so completely depressed, and opened negotiations\r\nwith John of Gaunt for a joint effort to recover the lost provinces. But\r\nbetween France and Castile the King of Navarre found himself powerless.\r\nThe royal troops seized the strong places which he possessed in France,\r\nwhile the Castilians entered Navarre and laid siege to Pampeluna.\r\nCharles the Bad was deserted even by his own son, and was forced to make\r\na humiliating peace in 1378. If the French forces had now been\r\nconcentrated on the reduction of Bordeaux and Bayonne, and if the\r\nCastilian fleet had been employed to cut off reinforcements by sea, the\r\nEnglish must have lost their last strongholds in Aquitaine. But Charles\r\nV. was tempted by his successes to undertake a more ambitious\r\nproject—the annexation of the duchy of Brittany to the royal domain.\r\nSuch a plan at once raised the whole of Brittany against him. The\r\nsupporters of the House of Blois, who had fought for the king against de\r\nMontfort, were resolute to defend the independence of their province.\r\nThe great soldiers of France, Bertrand du Guesclin and Olivier de\r\nClisson, were Bretons by birth, and though they obeyed the royal orders,\r\ntheir action in Brittany was reluctant and inefficient. The rebellion\r\nwas wholly successful; John de Montfort was restored to his duchy, and\r\nwas even welcomed by the widowed Countess of Blois, who had so long\r\nchampioned the cause of her husband against him. This failure in\r\nBrittany was a bitter disappointment to Charles V., and his chagrin was\r\nincreased by the death of Bertrand du Guesclin. The king himself did not\r\nlong survive his most brilliant and faithful servant, and at the time of\r\nhis death (September 16, 1380), the English still possessed a foothold\r\nin the north and south of France, which enabled them to make disastrous\r\nuse of the disorders of the next reign.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  See above, p. 64.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Charles had been created by his father Duke of Normandy as well as\r\n  Dauphin of Vienne.

(1313) gave occasion for one of\r\nthose disputed elections which were almost inevitable as [Sidenote:\r\nDisputed election in the Empire.] long as there was no central power\r\nstrong enough to control German factions, and as long as the rules or\r\ncustom of election were uncertain and ill-defined. The Hapsburgs eagerly\r\ngrasped at the opportunity of recovering the power they had lost by the\r\ndeath of Albert I. Their opponents, headed as before by Baldwin of\r\nTrier, passed over John of Bohemia on account of his youth, and put\r\nforward as their candidate Lewis, Duke of Upper Bavaria. The rival\r\nforces were not ill-balanced. On October 19, 1314, Frederick the\r\nHandsome, son of Albert I., was chosen at Sachsenhausen by the\r\nArchbishop of Köln, Henry of Carinthia, still claiming the crown of\r\nBohemia (see p. 18), the Elector Palatine, and the Duke of\r\nSaxe-Wittenberg. On the following day five electors—the Archbishops of\r\nMainz and Trier, John of Bohemia, Margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg, and\r\nthe Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg—gave their votes at Frankfurt in favour of\r\nLewis the Bavarian. Thus two votes—those of Saxony and Bohemia—were cast\r\nby rival claimants upon both sides. On November 25, a double coronation\r\ntook place: Frederick being crowned at Bonn, and Lewis at Aachen. The\r\ndispute could only be settled by arms; and a desultory war, lasting for\r\nseven years, was closed in 1322 by the battle of Mühldorf, where the\r\ncapture of his rival seemed to secure the final victory of Lewis.\r\n\r\nBut the very completeness of Lewis’s triumph only served to provoke a\r\nfar more formidable enemy than the Hapsburg duke. As long as the war\r\nlasted in Germany, the Pope had been content to pursue his policy of\r\nstrengthening the Guelf party in Italy, confident that his Ghibelline\r\nopponents could receive no assistance from beyond the Alps. Clement V.,\r\non hearing of the death of Henry VII., had seized the opportunity to\r\nclaim the administration, and to grant the office of imperial vicar\r\nduring the vacancy to his patron and ally, Robert of Naples. John XXII.,\r\nwho succeeded Clement in 1316, after an interregnum of over two years,\r\ncontinued his predecessor’s policy. But Robert of Naples could only just\r\nhold his own against the Visconti and other Ghibelline leaders; and the\r\nbattle of Mühldorf seemed likely to turn the scale decisively against\r\nthe Guelfs. In his partisanship for the Angevin cause, John XXII.\r\ndetermined to revive the most extreme claims of the mediæval Papacy. On\r\nthe pretext that he had [Sidenote: Quarrel of Lewis IV. and John XXII.]\r\nthe right to decide the disputed election, and that neither claimant\r\ncould assume the imperial office without his sanction, he called upon\r\nLewis to plead his cause before the Roman Curia (1323), and, when he\r\nfailed to appear, pronounced him contumacious and finally proceeded to\r\nissue a bull of excommunication against him. Thus commenced a struggle\r\nbetween the Empire and Papacy which was continued under the pontificates\r\nof Benedict XII. (1334-1342) and Clement VI., and was hardly terminated\r\nby the death of Lewis in 1347.\r\n\r\nIn many ways this struggle looks like a revival of past struggles\r\nbetween Emperors and Popes, and to raise the old questions as to the\r\nrelations of Church and State. But if it [Sidenote: Peculiarities of the\r\nquarrel.] is examined a little closer, it will be found to differ in\r\nseveral important respects from its predecessors, and to present\r\npeculiar characteristics of its own. In the first place, the dispute\r\narises from more petty causes, and the combatants are of lesser mould\r\nthan the protagonists of earlier times. There is no Hildebrand or\r\nInnocent III. among the Avignon Popes, and Lewis the Bavarian lacks both\r\nthe courage and the imposing personality of Frederick Barbarossa or\r\nFrederick II. The pretensions of the rival powers are less far-reaching\r\nand exalted; and if at times we find the language of the past reproduced\r\nin the papal bulls, it sounds unreal and almost ridiculous. No more\r\nconclusive illustration of the decline of both Papacy and Empire can be\r\npresented than the impression of unreality and insignificance produced\r\non the mind by the records of this long and obstinate contest.\r\n\r\nYet it is hardly probable that this impression was shared by\r\ncontemporary spectators. To them the struggle must have seemed to\r\ninvolve questions of vital importance. No previous contest between the\r\nrival heads of Christendom had produced so much literature, or\r\nliterature of such merit and significance. Michael of Cesena, the\r\ngeneral of the Franciscan Order, John of Jandun, and William of Ockham,\r\n‘The Invincible Doctor,’ exhausted the subtleties of the scholastic\r\nphilosophy in their championship of the imperial position against papal\r\npretensions. Above all, Marsiglio of Padua, in his great work the\r\n_Defensor Pacis_, examined with equal acuteness and insight the\r\nfundamental relations of the spiritual and secular powers, and laid down\r\nprinciples which were destined to find at any rate partial expression in\r\nthe Reformation.[7]\r\n\r\nThis outburst of literary and philosophical activity was due in great\r\npart to the fact that for the first time in the long strife between\r\nPapacy and Empire, the struggle involved doctrinal differences. Hitherto\r\nthe contest had been between Church and State, and the Church had been\r\nfor the most part united. But, on the present occasion, the Church was\r\nprofoundly divided. The great Franciscan Order had been founded by the\r\nprofessed advocate of clerical poverty. In course of time this original\r\nprinciple [Sidenote: The Franciscans and the Pope.] had been departed\r\nfrom, and the Order had amassed considerable wealth, though it had been\r\nfound desirable to conceal the change by making the Pope the trustee,\r\nand giving the Order the mere usufruct of its property. This lapse from\r\nthe strictness of the original rules had given rise to a schism within\r\nthe Order. The Spiritual Franciscans, or Fraticelli, maintained that\r\nChrist and the Apostles held no individual or corporate property, and\r\nthat the Church was bound to copy the examples of its founders. This\r\ndoctrine, which was accepted by a chapter of the Order in 1322, was not\r\nlikely to find favour with a Pope who was accused, with good reason, of\r\navarice. John XXII., urged on by the Dominicans, denounced the doctrine\r\nas heretical, and thereby alienated the Franciscans, who could plead in\r\ntheir favour a bull of Nicolas III., and appealed from the authority of\r\nthe Pope to a General Council of the Church. In common hostility to John\r\nXXII., the Franciscans espoused the cause of Lewis the Bavarian, and it\r\nwas among them that he found his most enthusiastic champions, and his\r\nmost influential advisers.\r\n\r\nThis antagonism of a section of the Church to its own head seemed likely\r\nto be increased in John XXII.’s later years, when he was induced to\r\nfavour the [Sidenote: Heresy of the Beatific Vision.] dogma that the\r\ndead are not admitted to the divine presence until after the final day\r\nof judgment. This contention struck at the root of the prevalent custom\r\nof invoking the mediation of the saints, and provoked a storm of\r\nopposition throughout Europe. Even the French king threatened to abandon\r\nthe cause of so heterodox a Pope, and on his death-bed John found it\r\nprudent or necessary to retract his too hasty opinion.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that these doctrinal disputes weakened the Papacy, and so\r\nfar tended to give the Emperor an advantage. But this gain to Lewis was\r\nas nothing compared with the strength which he derived from the most\r\nnoteworthy peculiarity of the struggle. In all previous contests with\r\nthe Empire, the Popes had been able to command the services of an\r\nanti-imperial party within Germany, and this party had included not only\r\nthe great ecclesiastics, but many of the lay princes. But in the great\r\ncritical moments of the struggle with Lewis, this was found to be\r\nimpossible. For the first time in history the German ruler found himself\r\n[Sidenote: National sentiment in Germany.] backed up by a vigorous\r\nnational sentiment among his subjects, a sentiment quite as strong as\r\nthat which had supported Philip IV. of France against Boniface VIII. The\r\nprimary cause of this unwonted union among German princes and people was\r\nundoubtedly the residence at Avignon and the subservience of the Popes\r\nto France. The national revolt against a spiritual authority which\r\nallowed itself to become the tool of a hostile state, led in England to\r\nthe issue of the great statutes of Provisors and Præmunire, and found\r\nequally resolute expression in Germany in the famous decrees of 1338.\r\nBenedict XII., more moderate and placable than his predecessor, had been\r\non the verge of a reconciliation with the Emperor, but was actually\r\nforbidden to put an end to the quarrel by the imperious Philip VI. This\r\nopen dictation on the part of the French king drove the Germans to fury.\r\nIn July, 1338, all the electors with the exception of the King of\r\nBohemia met at Rense on the Rhine, and formally resolved that the\r\nimperial authority proceeds directly from God, and that the prince who\r\nis legally chosen by the electors becomes king and emperor without any\r\nfurther ceremony or confirmation. This meeting is noteworthy in the\r\nconstitutional history of Germany as the first occasion on which the\r\nelectors assumed corporate functions other than the filling of a vacancy\r\nin the throne. In the following month, a numerously attended diet at\r\nFrankfort endorsed the declaration of Rense, and proceeded to draw up\r\nlaws which should strengthen the central power. The punishment of death\r\nis decreed against all breakers of the public peace: the feudal tenant\r\nwho takes arms against his imperial overlord is declared to forfeit both\r\nlife and property: whoever refuses to take up arms at the summons of the\r\nEmperor is pronounced guilty of felony. The decrees of Frankfort seem to\r\npromise a revival of the German monarchy.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all these advantages on the side of the Emperor, the quarrel\r\nended, not exactly in a papal triumph, yet in the complete and\r\nhumiliating discomfiture of Lewis. Doubtless the personal character of\r\nthe Emperor [Sidenote: Causes of Lewis’s failure.] contributed\r\nessentially to this result. Lewis was well-meaning but vacillating: he\r\ncould take strenuous measures under the influence of a stronger will,\r\nbut when he lost his adviser his habitual irresolution and his\r\nsuperstitious dread of the terrors of excommunication returned upon him.\r\nTo carry through the contest he required the firmness, the intellectual\r\ncraft, and the want of reverence of a Philip the Fair; and he had none\r\nof these qualities. On more than one critical occasion, when success\r\nseemed within his grasp, he alienated and disgusted his supporters by\r\ngrovelling offers to purchase absolution by surrendering all the\r\nprinciples which were at stake in the quarrel. Moreover, the doctrinal\r\ndisputes in which he became involved, although a source of weakness to\r\nthe Pope, were not an equal source of strength to the Emperor. The\r\nFranciscans had many powerful opponents, especially in the great rival\r\nOrder of St. Dominic, and these were alienated from the Emperor by his\r\nalliance with a faction in the Church. The Franciscan cause rested upon\r\nan unpractical enthusiasm which could not command the lasting support of\r\nthe clergy, accustomed as they were to wealth and to the influence which\r\nit confers. And in the end, the strong corporate spirit of the Church\r\nwas inevitably aroused and alienated by the spectacle of a secular ruler\r\ninterfering in questions of dogma, and claiming a right of\r\ninterpretation and decision.\r\n\r\nThere was, too, in the Emperor’s position a fundamental weakness which,\r\nunless detected and remedied, was inevitably fatal to his success.\r\nNeither Lewis nor the Franciscan advisers who in the early years of the\r\nstruggle dictated his conduct, could realise that the conditions of the\r\nMiddle Ages were passing away. They could not see that the old imperial\r\npretensions were obsolete; that intervention in Italy had always brought\r\nruin to German kings; that even in Italy the Guelfs had the stronger,\r\nbecause the less anti-national, position; and that the Ghibellines, the\r\nprofessed champions of imperial ascendency, only pursued this policy for\r\ntheir own ends, and had no real desire to weaken their independence by\r\nthe foundation of a strong Italian monarchy. Lewis had an almost unique\r\nopportunity of building up such a monarchy in Germany, not on the lines\r\nof the mediæval Empire, but on the basis of the newly awakened national\r\nsentiment and sympathy. This opportunity he threw away because he had no\r\nconception of the conditions under which alone such success could be\r\nattained. Instead of endeavouring to rule as an Edward I. or a Philip\r\nIV., he set himself to imitate the Ottos of the tenth century.\r\n\r\nIn 1325 Germany was astounded by the news that Lewis had been formally\r\nreconciled with his imprisoned rival. It is true that the treaty was not\r\ncarried out, and Frederick, unable to fulfil his promises in face of the\r\nopposition of his brothers, returned to captivity. But in the following\r\nyear the death of Leopold, the most resolute and active of the Hapsburg\r\nprinces, removed all danger to Lewis from this quarter, and enabled him\r\nto follow the advice of his Franciscan counsellors and to take\r\naggressive measures against the Pope. In 1327 the Emperor appeared\r\n[Sidenote: Lewis in Italy.] at Trent, where he was welcomed by the\r\nGhibelline leaders eager to have his assistance against Robert of\r\nNaples. At Milan he received the iron crown of Lombardy, and thence,\r\naccompanied by Castruccio Castracani, Lord of Lucca, he set out for\r\nRome. The Guelf cause seemed to be ruined in northern and central Italy,\r\nand the partisans of the Pope and Naples fled from the city. In January,\r\n1328, Lewis was crowned Emperor by two bishops, whose chief\r\nqualification was that they shared with their patron the penalties of\r\nexcommunication. Three months were spent in planning further\r\nproceedings, and in April John XXII. was formally declared uncanonically\r\nelected and guilty of heresy. In May, Peter di Corvara, a Franciscan\r\nfriar, nominated by the Emperor and accepted by the acclamations of the\r\ncitizens, assumed the papal title as Nicolas V.\r\n\r\nThis initiation of a schism in the interests of the Franciscan party\r\nmarks the limit of the Emperor’s success in Italy. He had committed\r\nhimself to an enterprise which he had neither the moral nor the material\r\nforce to carry through. His immediate enemy, Robert of Naples, had not\r\nyet been even attacked. When the imperial troops advanced southwards in\r\nJune, they were speedily compelled to retreat, and Lewis thought it\r\nadvisable to evacuate Rome and retire to the Ghibelline strongholds in\r\nthe north. The Emperor was accompanied by his Antipope, and the Roman\r\npopulace, with characteristic inconstancy, expelled the imperial\r\npartisans and opened their gates to the Orsini and the Neapolitan\r\ntroops. To make matters worse, death carried off two of Lewis’s chief\r\nadvisers, Castruccio Castracani and Marsiglio of Padua. From this time\r\nhis career in Italy was one long catalogue of blunders, and he eagerly\r\nseized the excuse for returning to Germany on the news of the death of\r\nhis former rival, Frederick the Handsome (January, 1330). The\r\nunfortunate Nicolas V., deserted by his patron, was compelled to resign\r\nhis dignity and to make the most humiliating submission to John XXII. He\r\nended his life a prisoner in the palace of Avignon.\r\n\r\nAfter such a complete and disastrous failure it might have been thought\r\nthat the cause of Lewis was ruined, and that he too would have to submit\r\nto the triumphant Pope. But the open alliance of the Papacy with France,\r\nand the consequent alienation of Germany, enabled him to recover much of\r\nthe lost ground, and by 1338 his position appeared [Sidenote: Position\r\nof Lewis in 1338.] to be firmer than ever. At the head of a national\r\nmovement, which had expressed its sentiments unmistakably in the decrees\r\nof Rense and Frankfort, and closely allied with Edward III. of England,\r\nwho was now committed to his great war with France, Lewis seemed able to\r\ndictate his own terms both to Benedict XII. and Philip VI.\r\n\r\nBut Lewis was as incapable as ever of pursuing a resolute and consistent\r\ncourse of policy, and at the very moment when success seemed assured he\r\nbegan to vacillate and draw back. In 1340 he suddenly abandoned the\r\nEnglish alliance and made terms with Philip VI., in the hope that the\r\nFrench king would use his influence to secure for him the papal\r\nabsolution. Philip, delighted to be freed from a very pressing danger,\r\ndid endeavour to intercede with the Pope, but even the gentle Benedict\r\nfired up at this attempt to command what the king had previously\r\nforbidden; and the Pope died in April 1342, without having granted the\r\nEmperor the pardon for which he craved. The Germans were naturally\r\ndisgusted by Lewis’s pusillanimity, but this feeling was as nothing\r\ncompared to the storm of indignation excited by the Emperor’s conduct in\r\nthe question of Tyrol. The final cause of Lewis’s failure is to be found\r\nin his reckless pursuit of that policy of family aggrandisement which\r\nhad been almost forced upon the holders of the imperial dignity since\r\nthe Great Interregnum. In his insatiable greed for territory, he did not\r\nhesitate to alienate the chief German princes at a time when their\r\nsupport was absolutely indispensable.\r\n\r\nIn 1335 Henry, Duke of Carinthia and Count of Tyrol, had died leaving an\r\nonly daughter, Margaret Maultasch, who [Sidenote: Succession question in\r\nTyrol.] was married to John Henry of Moravia, a son of King John of\r\nBohemia. The claim of Margaret to succeed to her father’s territories\r\nwas contested by the dukes of Austria, whose father, Albert I., had\r\nmarried the sister of Henry of Carinthia. The struggle for the\r\nsuccession between the Houses of Hapsburg and Luxemburg ended in a\r\npartition, the Hapsburg dukes taking Carinthia, while Tyrol was ceded to\r\ntheir niece Margaret. But the marriage relations of Margaret and John\r\nHenry proved extremely inharmonious, and in 1341 the former discarded\r\nher husband and threw herself upon the protection of the Emperor. The\r\ntemptation to acquire a new province for his House was more than Lewis\r\ncould resist. He had already in 1323, on the death of Waldemar of\r\nBrandenburg, conferred the vacant provinces and electorate on his eldest\r\nson Lewis. On the death of his cousins, the sons of Henry of Lower\r\nBavaria, he had seized their land and had thus united the whole of\r\nBavaria under his own rule. To these acquisitions he would now add the\r\ncounty of Tyrol. In reckless defiance of ecclesiastical prejudice, he\r\nusurped rights which had hitherto been exercised by the Church. By\r\nsolemn decree he granted Margaret a divorce from her husband, and a\r\ndispensation to marry his own son, Lewis of Brandenburg.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of this reckless action might have been foreseen. The\r\nclergy were alienated by the assumption of clerical powers by a layman,\r\nwhile the lay princes, headed by John of Bohemia, were jealously\r\nindignant at such an addition to the already immense possessions of the\r\nBavarian House. The new Pope, Clement VI., found himself at last in a\r\nposition to raise an anti-imperial party in Germany, and to bring about\r\nthe election of a rival king. But for the fact that Philip VI. was now\r\nengaged in the war with England, Clement, who was a thorough Frenchman,\r\nwould probably have used all his influence to secure the election of the\r\nFrench king. As it was, it was natural to find a candidate in the House\r\nof Luxemburg, which had most cause for exasperation with Lewis, and was\r\nalso closely allied with France. John of Bohemia himself was\r\ndisqualified by blindness, having lost his eyesight in a campaign\r\nagainst the heathen Wends of Prussia, but his eldest son, Charles, was\r\nput forward in his [Sidenote: Election of Charles IV., 1346.] place. The\r\nonly electors who supported Lewis were his own son, Lewis of\r\nBrandenburg, and the Archbishop of Mainz, Henry of Virneburg. The Pope,\r\nto secure another vote, deposed the archbishop, and awarded his see to\r\nGerlach of Nassau. On June 11, 1346, the three Archbishops, with John of\r\nBohemia and Rudolf of Saxony, formally elected Charles as king of the\r\nRomans. With characteristic quixotism the blind king, instead of\r\nasserting his son’s title with arms, hurried the new king off to France\r\nto aid his ally, Philip VI. On the field of Crecy John of Bohemia fell\r\nin heroic despair, but Charles IV., whose share in the battle is wrapped\r\nin some obscurity, escaped to Germany to maintain his title.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lewis had made the last great addition to the territories of\r\nhis family. His second wife, Margaret, was a sister of William IV. of\r\nHolland and Hainault, and [Sidenote: Death of Lewis, 1347.] on the death\r\nof that prince in 1345 his possessions fell to William V., a son of\r\nLewis by this second marriage. The House of Wittelsbach seemed for the\r\nmoment so powerful that it need fear no rival, and the injudicious\r\nabsence of the Luxemburg princes had enabled Lewis to strengthen himself\r\nstill further by an alliance with Albert of Austria. Charles found his\r\nposition almost hopeless. An attack upon Tyrol was repulsed, and he was\r\nforced to retire to Bohemia. Lewis, confident of an easy triumph, left\r\nthe prosecution of the campaign to the Margrave of Brandenburg and\r\nreturned to Bavaria, where he died suddenly on October 11, 1347, while\r\nengaged in a boar-hunt near Munich.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  See on this subject Riezler, _Die Literarischen Widersacher der Päpste\r\n  zur Zeit Ludwigs des Baiers_, and Creighton, _History of the Papacy\r\n  during the Reformation_, i. pp. 35-41.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n                    CHARLES IV.

It is true that\r\nBohemia was rich in mineral wealth, but in territorial power the House\r\nof Luxemburg was no match for the House of Wittelsbach, whose various\r\nmembers ruled over the Palatinate, the whole of Bavaria, the marks of\r\nBrandenburg, Tyrol, and the border districts of Hainault, Holland,\r\nZeeland, Friesland, and Utrecht. The second son of Lewis, Stephen, was\r\nhead of the powerful Swabian League, and the imperial towns were all on\r\nthe side of the Bavarian Emperor. The electors who had given Charles\r\ntheir votes were not prepared to make any sacrifices in his cause, and\r\nAlbert of Austria, the most powerful of the non-electoral princes, was\r\ncommitted to the cause of Lewis. The chief ally to whom Charles might\r\nhave looked for support was the French king; but Philip VI. was fully\r\noccupied in the war with Edward III., and was thus unable to take any\r\npart in the affairs of Germany.\r\n\r\nAnd Charles had another great disadvantage in his relations to the\r\nPapacy. In return for the support of Clement VI. he had made very\r\nextreme concessions in a treaty arranged at Avignon in April 1346. He\r\nhad admitted that the imperial coronation must follow confirmation of\r\nthe election by the Pope; he had promised that he would only go to Rome\r\nwith the Pope’s consent, and would only stay there a single day; the\r\nPope was to be arbiter in the disputes between the Empire and France. It\r\nis true that this treaty had not been published: and it is also true\r\nthat Lewis had more than once offered even greater concessions as the\r\nprice of absolution. Still, it was patent to all that Charles was the\r\nPapal candidate; and the injudicious boast of Clement that he held the\r\nimperial throne in his gift was not likely to conciliate German princes\r\nand people who had so energetically protested against spiritual\r\ndictation from Avignon. The imperial cities refused to open their gates\r\nto the _Pfaffen-Kaiser_, or ‘parson’s emperor,’ as they called him in\r\nderision.\r\n\r\nWhile affairs were in this almost hopeless condition, three events\r\noccurred which greatly improved Charles’s prospects. The first was the\r\nsudden death of his rival, Lewis the Bavarian. Another was the outbreak\r\nin 1348 of the Great Plague or Black Death, which diverted men’s\r\nattention from political disputes, and led them to look for the checking\r\nof anarchy and disorder to the prince who possessed at any rate the\r\ntitle of king. The third event was the appearance in Brandenburg of a\r\npretender claiming to be Waldemar, the last margrave of the House of\r\nAscania, who was supposed to have died in 1319, when the electorate had\r\nbeen conferred upon the eldest son of the late Emperor. The ‘false\r\nWaldemar,’ as he is called, declared that he had never died, but had\r\nbeen driven by the stings of conscience to undertake a prolonged\r\npilgrimage, from which he now returned to claim his rights. In order to\r\nweaken his Wittelsbach opponent, Charles gave his countenance [Sidenote:\r\nCharles secures the German crown.] to the pretender, who speedily\r\nsecured a large part of Brandenburg.\r\n\r\nIt was an additional advantage to Charles that the party of the late\r\nEmperor had great difficulty in finding a successor to put in his place.\r\nIn 1348 four electors—Henry of Virneburg, who still held the see of\r\nMainz in defiance of the papal authority, the Elector Palatine Rupert,\r\nLewis of Brandenburg, and Eric of Saxe-Lauenburg, who claimed to\r\nexercise the electoral vote of Saxony—sent proxies to Ober-Lahnstein to\r\nproceed to a new election. The vacant crown was offered in the first\r\nplace to Edward III. of England, who had indirectly rendered a service\r\nto the Bavarian party by preventing French aid being sent to Charles IV.\r\nBut Edward could neither neglect the French war nor face the resolute\r\nopposition of the English Parliament. On his refusal, the crown was\r\noffered to Lewis of Brandenburg, who had enough to do to cope with the\r\nfalse Waldemar, and then to Frederick of Meissen, who declined to risk\r\nanything in a losing cause. At last, in despair, the electors chose\r\nGunther of Schwartzburg, a military leader of some reputation, but below\r\nthe highest princely rank. Gunther, who had little to lose and\r\neverything to gain, accepted the proffered dignity, but he died in 1349,\r\nbefore he had time to test his ability to hold it.\r\n\r\nCharles IV. set himself, with rare diplomatic ability, to make the most\r\nof his own advantages and of the difficulties of his opponents. The\r\nimperial cities, discontented by the death of their patron, Lewis the\r\nBavarian, and involved in difficulties and disorders by the Plague, were\r\ngained over by the concession of privileges, and one by one opened their\r\ngates to Charles. Albert of Austria was detached from the Wittelsbach\r\nalliance by a politic marriage between his eldest son Rudolf and\r\nCharles’s second daughter Catharine. Charles, himself a widower, sued\r\nfor the hand of a daughter of the Elector Palatine, and thus gained to\r\nhis side the head of the House of Wittelsbach. Finally, by disowning the\r\ncause of the false Waldemar, he achieved the reconciliation of his most\r\nresolute opponent, Lewis of Brandenburg. The death of Gunther of\r\nSchwartzburg removed all difficulties in the way of Charles’s\r\nrecognition, and by 1350 his title was acknowledged throughout the whole\r\nof Germany.\r\n\r\nCharles IV. is incontestably the greatest ruler whom Europe produced in\r\nthe fourteenth century, yet his merits have met [Sidenote: Character of\r\nCharles IV.] with singularly little appreciation except from Bohemian\r\nhistorians. To most English readers he is chiefly known from the saying\r\nof Maximilian I. that he was ‘the father of Bohemia but the stepfather\r\nof the Empire,’ or by the more recent epigram of Mr. Bryce who says that\r\n‘he legalised anarchy and called it a constitution.’ Of the two sayings,\r\nthe latter is by far the more unjust and ill-founded. Charles is a\r\nunique figure in the family of Luxemburg which rose to such sudden and\r\nshort-lived eminence in the fourteenth century. His grandfather, Henry\r\nVII., threw away his life in a chimerical effort to revive an imperial\r\nauthority which was no longer either possible or desirable. His father,\r\nJohn of Bohemia, was the representative knight-errant of his time,\r\nperhaps the noblest type of fourteenth century chivalry—now crusading in\r\nPoland, now trying to found a new territorial power in Italy, and in the\r\nend deserting his own interests to fight and fall in the service of an\r\nally. Of Charles’s sons, the eldest, Wenzel, was a good-natured\r\nhedonist, who had few desires beyond the pleasures of the table; and the\r\nsecond, Sigismund, was a schemer who always imagined more than he could\r\nachieve. In the midst of this remarkable family, which can boast of\r\nthree emperors and a king who twice narrowly missed election to the same\r\ndignity, Charles IV. stands in complete contrast both to his\r\npredecessors and his successors. He had none of the romantic enthusiasm\r\nof his father or his grandfather, but he had what was far better—a\r\nstrong sense of the practical duties of government, and a strenuous\r\nbusiness capacity which enabled him to carry them out. It is true that\r\nhe failed to maintain the Ghibelline cause in Italy, but he preferred\r\nthe more solid and substantial aim of building up a territorial monarchy\r\nin Germany. He was distinguished among contemporary monarchs for his\r\npreference of diplomacy to force, for his strong legal sense, and his\r\nlove of order. Like Edward I. of England and Philip IV. of France, he\r\nmarks the transition from mediæval to modern ideals and methods of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe merits of Charles IV.’s government in Bohemia have never been\r\ncontested. One of the first-fruits of his good [Sidenote: Bohemia under\r\nCharles IV.] understanding with Clement VI. was the procuring of a papal\r\nbull to erect Prague into a metropolitan see, whereas it had previously\r\nbeen dependent on the Archbishop of Mainz. In 1348, while his affairs in\r\nGermany were in their most critical condition, Charles laid the\r\nfoundations of the University of Prague, with a constitution modelled\r\nupon that of the University of Paris, where the king himself had\r\nstudied. To Charles the Bohemian capital owes not only its university\r\nand its archbishopric, but also its famous bridge over the Moldau, and\r\nmany of its most notable buildings. Much of his attention was given to\r\nthe promotion of commerce. He established a uniform coinage, provided\r\nfor the protection of highways, and lowered the tolls upon roads and\r\nrivers. He projected a canal from the Moldau to the Danube, which was to\r\ncarry through Bohemia the traffic between Venice and the Hanseatic\r\nLeague. Many of his measures were protective in the extreme. Every\r\nforeign trader who crossed the Bohemian frontier was compelled to expose\r\nhis wares for sale in Prague; no foreigner could conclude a bargain\r\nexcept through a native merchant; and all goods had to be sold by\r\nBohemian weight and measure. Short-sighted as such regulations may\r\nappear in the present day, they were in accordance with the ideas of the\r\ntime, and they were not unsuccessful in attaining their end. From German\r\nand Slavonic countries nobles, merchants, teachers and scholars flocked\r\nto the capital of Bohemia; the members of the university were to be\r\ncounted by thousands before Charles’s death.\r\n\r\nUnder this beneficent rule Prague promised to become the chief city of\r\nGermany, and the balance of power and of civilisation was transferred\r\nfrom the west to the east. Charles, undoubtedly, looked forward to\r\nsecuring for the House of Luxemburg a position almost exactly similar to\r\nthat afterwards attained by the House of Hapsburg; and he trusted that\r\nhis descendants would enjoy, as the Hapsburgs did in later times, an\r\nunbroken and quasi-hereditary succession to the imperial throne. And his\r\nmore sanguine schemes did not stop at this point. He founded in Prague a\r\ncloister of Slavonic monks, collected from Bosnia, Servia, and Croatia,\r\nwhose task was to draw closer the bonds between Bohemia and the eastern\r\nSlavs, and ultimately to pave the way for a union between the Latin and\r\nGreek Churches. If this dream had been fulfilled, the Luxemburg House\r\nmight have founded a power greater than that of any Emperor, and\r\nBohemia, which has always been a triangular wedge thrust from the east\r\ninto the west, might have become a rivet between the two great divisions\r\nof the Continent.\r\n\r\nIn 1354 Charles IV. set out for Italy to receive the Lombard crown at\r\nMilan, and the imperial crown in Rome. [Sidenote: Charles IV. in Italy.]\r\nFrom the Ghibelline point of view his journey was ignominious, but as\r\nthrowing light upon Charles’s policy it was of great significance. He\r\nrefused to be drawn into the vortex of Italian politics, or to break his\r\ntreaty with the Pope. To the representations of the Ghibelline leaders,\r\nas to the eloquent appeals of Petrarch, Charles turned a deaf ear. He\r\nentered Rome to be crowned, paraded the streets in his imperial robes,\r\nand then retired outside the walls to San Lorenzo. With as little delay\r\nas possible, he hastened on his return journey. It was a deliberate\r\nrenunciation of the claim of the mediæval Emperors to rule in Italy.\r\nCharles saw clearly that Germany had been ruined by the attempts of its\r\nrulers to make their monarchy in Italy a practical force, and in the\r\ninterests of Germany he refused to imitate the folly of his\r\npredecessors. His main object was the reconstruction of an orderly and\r\nefficient authority in Germany, and that object could only be achieved\r\nby resolutely cutting himself free from the entanglement of Italian\r\nambitions.\r\n\r\nIt was to the task of reform in Germany that Charles devoted himself\r\nimmediately on his return to Germany, and his conferences with the diets\r\nat Nürnberg in 1355 and 1356 resulted in the issue of the great\r\nenactment with which his name will always be connected—the Golden Bull.\r\nThere were two great and pressing [Sidenote: Difficulties in Germany.]\r\nproblems which required solution. One very obvious cause of recent\r\ndisorders in Germany had been the disputed elections to the Empire, and\r\nthese were intimately associated with the uncertainty as to the rules of\r\nelection. It is true that tradition had decided that there should be\r\nseven electors, and that certain sees and certain families had claims to\r\nthe right of voting. But the German practice of subdividing lands among\r\nmale heirs had given rise to great uncertainty as to which member of a\r\nfamily should exercise this right. Thus the House of Wittelsbach was\r\nsplit into two main branches, the one holding the Palatinate of the\r\nRhine, the other the duchy of Bavaria. By family agreement the\r\nWittelsbach vote was to be given alternately by the heads of the two\r\nbranches, but such an arrangement was certain to give rise to quarrels.\r\nIn 1314 the Saxon vote had been given on opposite sides by two rival\r\nclaimants, and the same thing had taken place in the elections of 1346\r\nand 1348. The prevention of similar disputes in the future was a primary\r\ncondition of peace and order in Germany, and was one of the main objects\r\nof the Golden Bull.\r\n\r\nThe second great and pressing difficulty in Germany was the danger of\r\nthe complete disruption of all political unity. There were innumerable\r\ntenants-in-chief, electors, princes, knights and cities, held together\r\nby nothing but common allegiance to a monarchy which had lost all\r\nefficient authority. If no remedy could be devised, Germany must become\r\na mere geographical expression like Italy. The cities would become\r\nindependent republics, and desolating wars between them and their\r\nprincely neighbours would lead to incurable anarchy. In that case, the\r\nborder provinces must inevitably fall to the growing power of France.\r\nLyons was already gone; Dauphiné was practically lost. Provence and\r\nFranche-Comté, though acknowledging imperial suzerainty, were subject to\r\nFrench influence and destined to fall, with the Netherlands, under the\r\nrule of a French dynasty. German ascendency would disappear, first in\r\nthe valley of the Rhone and then in that of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nCharles IV. was fully alive to these dangers. He had accompanied his\r\nfather to Italy in 1330, had acted for a time as his vicegerent, and had\r\nthen acquired an insight into Italian politics which profoundly\r\ninfluenced his subsequent policy. It is hardly too much to say that his\r\nguiding motive was to preserve Germany from the fate which nominal\r\nsubjection to imperial rule had brought upon Italy. And though he was\r\nconnected by relationship, education, and past alliances with the Valois\r\nHouse of France, he was by no means blind to the dangers of French\r\naggression in the west. It was in the vain hope of checking the constant\r\nfalling away of border lands that in 1365 he went through the ceremony\r\nof being crowned King of Arles, disused by his predecessors since\r\nFrederick Barbarossa.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of imperial elections, the provisions of the Golden Bull\r\nare clear and precise, and they remained a [Sidenote: The Golden Bull,\r\n1356.] fundamental law until the Holy Roman Empire ended its shadowy\r\nexistence in 1806. The number of electors is fixed at seven—viz. three\r\necclesiastics, the Archbishops of Mainz, Köln, and Trier, and four lay\r\nprinces, the King of Bohemia, the Count Palatine of the Rhine, the Duke\r\nof Saxony, and the Margrave of Brandenburg. The three ecclesiastical\r\nelectors are to be archchancellors of the three kingdoms: the Archbishop\r\nof Mainz in Germany, the Archbishop of Köln in Italy, and the Archbishop\r\nof Trier in Arles. The four secular electors are to hold the great\r\nhousehold offices: the King of Bohemia is chief cup-bearer, the Count\r\nPalatine grand-seneschal, the Duke of Saxony grand-marshal, and the\r\nMargrave of Brandenburg grand-chamberlain. The election of the Kings of\r\nthe Romans and future Emperors is to be held in Frankfort, and decided\r\nby a majority of votes. The elected prince is to be crowned at Aachen,\r\nand to hold his first diet at Nürnberg. The territories to which the\r\nelectoral dignity is attached are never to be divided, and the\r\nsuccession is to be regulated by the rules of primogeniture among male\r\nagnates. During a minority, the electoral vote and the administration of\r\nthe electoral provinces are to be intrusted to the nearest male relative\r\non the father’s side. The electors are to take rank before all other\r\nprinces; they are to have the royal rights of coining money and of final\r\njurisdiction without appeal. All confederations of subjects without the\r\nleave of their territorial lord are prohibited, and the towns are\r\nforbidden to grant their citizenship to _pfahlbürger_, or burghers\r\noutside the walls, or to receive fugitive serfs to the shelter of their\r\nwalls and franchises.\r\n\r\nThere is one omission in the Golden Bull which is as significant and\r\nimportant as any of its direct provisions. The [Sidenote: The Papacy and\r\nthe Golden Bull.] papal claims to confirm or veto an election, and to\r\nadminister the Empire during a vacancy, were passed over in complete\r\nsilence. The great electoral resolutions of Rense were practically but\r\nsilently erected into an imperial law, and the election of future\r\nEmperors was to be treated as a private affair of the German nation.\r\nInnocent VI. did not hesitate to show his displeasure at the\r\npromulgation of such a law by a prince who was regarded as the docile\r\ncreature of the Holy See. But Charles IV. showed a firmness worthy of\r\nEdward I. or of Philip the Fair. When the papal nuncio tried to levy a\r\ntenth of clerical revenues, Charles replied by demanding a reform of\r\necclesiastical abuses and by threatening to confiscate Church property.\r\nThe Pope was forced to give way, and to abandon his opposition to the\r\nGolden Bull.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the practical results of the Golden Bull, historians are\r\nunanimous. It erected an aristocratic federation [Sidenote: Results of\r\nthe Golden Bull.] in Germany in place of the older monarchy, and the\r\nGerman constitution never lost the impress which it received in the\r\nfourteenth century. The powers and privileges which the Bull conferred\r\nupon the electors were inconsistent with the exercise of efficient\r\nmonarchical authority. And though the secular electors in 1356 were not,\r\nwith the exception of Charles himself, very powerful princes, yet it was\r\ncertain that the establishment of primogeniture and of indivisibility of\r\nterritories would before long give them a territorial power\r\nproportionate to their elevated rank.\r\n\r\nBut historians have misjudged Charles IV., partly because [Sidenote:\r\nMotives of Charles IV.] they have fallen into the common error of\r\nconfusing the results of the Golden Bull with the intentions of its\r\nauthor, and partly because they have paid insufficient attention to the\r\nprecise circumstances of the time in which he lived. Charles was\r\nprofoundly convinced—and it is difficult to maintain that he was\r\nwrong—that the mediæval Empire was at an end, and that any attempt to\r\nrevive it would result in the ruin of Germany. The forces which he most\r\ndreaded were the rising cities in the north and south, and the greater\r\nterritorial princes, such as the Hapsburgs and the Bavarian\r\nWittelsbachs. Both of these were weakened by the Golden Bull—the cities\r\nby its actual provisions, and the princes by their definite exclusion\r\nfrom the electoral vote, and by the virtual lowering of their rank which\r\nwas effected by the elevation of the electors. It is true that the\r\nelectors themselves received powers and privileges which might prove the\r\nfoundation of independence, but at the same time their interests were\r\nenlisted on the side of unity. The Golden Bull gave them a grander\r\nposition as joint rulers of Germany than they could look forward to as\r\nmere rulers in their own provinces. Thus it might reasonably be hoped\r\nthat they would resist the further progress of that disruption which had\r\nalready done so much harm to Germany.\r\n\r\nAnd while he provided this check upon growing disunion, Charles IV. had\r\nno desire or expectation that the state of things recognised and\r\nconfirmed in the Golden Bull should be permanent. His intention was to\r\nobtain for the House of Luxemburg such an overwhelming territorial\r\nstrength that he would secure to his successors a practically hereditary\r\nclaim to the imperial office, and also such a predominance in the\r\nelectoral college as would enable them to rule Germany through that\r\nbody. By gradually adding province after province to the family domain,\r\nit might be possible in the end to build up a territorial monarchy like\r\nthat which existed in England and was in process of construction in\r\nFrance. It is true that such a monarchy might be less imposing than the\r\nwide-reaching claims of imperial suzerainty, but it would be infinitely\r\nstronger and more advantageous to Germany. No single lifetime could be\r\nlong enough to effect such a work, and Charles’s direct heirs only\r\nlasted for a single generation, and were themselves incapable of\r\nfollowing in their father’s footsteps. But such territorial power as was\r\nafterwards gained in Germany by the Hapsburgs was, for the most part,\r\nacquired by following the lines laid down by Charles IV., and in more\r\nthan one way the Hapsburgs may be regarded as the heirs of the House of\r\nLuxemburg.\r\n\r\nIt is this definite policy which gives to Charles’s territorial\r\nambitions an interest and a dignity which are lacking to the purely\r\nselfish and aimless acquisitiveness of his [Sidenote: Territorial\r\nacquisitions of Charles IV.] predecessor. In 1356 John, Duke of Brabant\r\nand Limburg died, and his territories passed to his daughter and her\r\nhusband Wenzel, Duke of Luxemburg, Charles’s youngest brother. The\r\nEmperor supported his brother against the rival claims of the Count of\r\nFlanders, and obtained from the duchess and the estates of Brabant an\r\nagreement that, in default of heirs, the provinces should fall to the\r\nmain line of Luxemburg. In 1363 occurred a very important crisis in the\r\nfamily relationships of Germany through the death of Meinhard, the only\r\nson of Margaret Maultasch and of Lewis of Bavaria, the eldest son of the\r\nlate Emperor (see p. 107). Meinhard’s death left vacant both Tyrol and\r\nthe duchy of Upper Bavaria. The Hapsburg claim to Tyrol, which had\r\nfailed in 1335, was promptly renewed by Rudolf of Austria. Rudolf was\r\none of the princes who were most indignant at the increased rank given\r\nto the electors by the Golden Bull, and he had shown his irritation by\r\nassuming the title of ‘archduke,’ which in the next century was\r\npermanently adopted by the House of Hapsburg. Charles IV. seized the\r\nopportunity to gain over so powerful a malcontent. He confirmed Rudolf\r\nin possession of Tyrol, and at the same time concluded with him a treaty\r\nof mutual inheritance by which, on the extinction of either House, the\r\nother was to inherit all its lands. At the time, the House of Hapsburg\r\nseemed nearer to extinction than that of Luxemburg; and, as a matter of\r\nfact, the treaty was never actually carried out. But it is not a little\r\ncurious that within a century after the male line of Luxemburg had come\r\nto an end, almost all the territories which it held in 1364 had passed,\r\nin one way or another, into the hands of the Hapsburgs.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a struggle had broken out as to the succession in Upper\r\nBavaria. By a treaty made in 1349 between the sons of Lewis the\r\nBavarian, that duchy ought now to have gone to Lewis the Roman and Otto,\r\nin whose favour their elder brother Lewis had renounced the possession\r\nof Brandenburg. But the second brother, Stephen of Lower Bavaria,\r\nanticipated their claim and obtained his own recognition from the\r\nestates of Upper Bavaria. The two margraves applied for assistance to\r\nCharles IV., and promised him the succession to Brandenburg if they died\r\nwithout heirs. This agreement ultimately took effect in 1373, when Otto,\r\nthe surviving margrave, was induced or compelled to cede Brandenburg to\r\nthe Emperor, who pledged himself to the estates that the union of\r\nBrandenburg with Bohemia should be perpetual. Thus Charles acquired a\r\nsecond electoral vote and a very notable increase of his territorial\r\npower in northern Germany. About the same time he betrothed his second\r\nson, Sigismund, to the daughter of Lewis the Great, King of Hungary and\r\nPoland, and thus opened a prospect of adding these states to the now\r\nenormous possessions of the Luxemburg House.\r\n\r\nThese actual or prospective acquisitions could be of little permanent\r\nvalue unless Charles could secure to his House the continued occupation\r\nof the imperial office, and in 1374 he began to sound the electors on\r\nthe subject [Sidenote: Election of Wenzel.] of the election of his son\r\nWenzel, a boy of fifteen years old. But there were many difficulties in\r\nthe way. The Golden Bull made no provision for an election during the\r\nlifetime of any occupant of the throne. The spirit, if not the letter,\r\nof the law was against such a thing. There were also serious objections\r\nto the election of a minor, and many princes were jealous of the\r\npredominance already gained by the Luxemburgers. Charles, however, was\r\nnot very scrupulous in such a critical matter, even about the observance\r\nof his own laws. He gained over the electors, but by the old\r\nobjectionable method of bribing them. He did not hesitate to appeal for\r\npapal approval, thus reviving the pretensions which the Golden Bull had\r\npractically abrogated. But his policy was successful in its immediate\r\naim. Wenzel was elected at Frankfort on June 16, and crowned at Aachen\r\non July 6, 1376.\r\n\r\nThe election of Wenzel as King of the Romans was the last triumph of\r\nCharles IV. His repressive attitude towards the cities had met with only\r\npartial success. The great northern Hansa had conducted a successful war\r\nagainst Waldemar III., one of the strongest of Danish kings, and in 1370\r\nhad forced him to conclude a humiliating treaty at Stralsund (see p.\r\n437). And in 1376 a new danger arose in the south. The Swabian towns\r\nwere disgusted at the sacrifice [Sidenote: The Swabian League.] of the\r\nlast imperial domains in their province to purchase electoral votes.\r\nThey renewed an old league under the leadership of Ulm, and refused to\r\nrecognise Wenzel’s election. At Reutlingen (May 14, 1377) the forces of\r\nthe league won a complete victory over their hated enemy, the Count of\r\nWürtemburg. This was followed by a rapid extension of the confederation,\r\nand Charles was too old and too weak to attempt its suppression. In\r\nAugust, 1378, he authorised his son Wenzel to conclude a peace between\r\nthe towns and the princes, and to concede the right of union to the\r\nformer. Thus one of the provisions of the Golden Bull was abandoned\r\nduring Charles’s own lifetime.\r\n\r\nNor was this the only blow which Charles experienced in his later years.\r\nHe had long struggled to put an end to the papal residence at Avignon,\r\nwhich was a scandal to Europe and a serious injury in many ways to\r\nGerman and imperial interests. He had succeeded in persuading Urban V.\r\nto return to Rome in 1367, and had himself visited the Pope in the\r\nEternal City. But Urban was alienated by Charles’s refusal to take\r\nactive measures against the Ghibelline Visconti, and was easily induced\r\nby his French cardinals to return to Avignon. The whole work had to be\r\nbegun again. At last, in 1377, Gregory XI. was persuaded to quit the\r\n[Sidenote: The Great Schism.] banks of the Rhone and to take up his\r\nresidence in Rome. But he was meditating a second withdrawal from the\r\ncity when he was overtaken by death. The new election had to take place\r\nin Rome, and the choice of the cardinals fell upon an Italian, Urban VI.\r\nThis seemed for the moment a conspicuous triumph for Charles IV. But\r\nUrban’s violence alienated the French cardinals, who seceded from Rome\r\nand elected a rival Pope, Clement VII. Clement naturally threw himself\r\nupon French support, and fixed his residence at Avignon. Thus the return\r\nto Rome, instead of putting an end to scandal, gave rise to the famous\r\nschism in the Church which lasted for forty years. Charles IV. was\r\nbitterly chagrined, and appealed to all the European princes to\r\nrecognise Urban and to resist the excessive and dictatorial power of\r\nFrance. And there was some reasonable ground for such an appeal. A\r\nbrother of Charles V. of France was Duke of Burgundy, and the Duke’s\r\nwife was the heiress of Flanders, Artois, and Franche Comté. Another\r\nbrother claimed the succession in Naples, and the King of Hungary and\r\nPoland was a member of the older House of Anjou. The prince who was\r\nnaturally expected to resist this threatening danger to the balance of\r\nstates was Charles IV., who might have found it necessary to lead an\r\narmy against the French king and the Antipope. But on November 29, 1378,\r\njust two months after the [Sidenote: Death of Charles IV.] outbreak of\r\nthe schism, death removed him from the scene of strife.\r\n\r\nBefore his death, Charles IV.’s weakness for his children had led him\r\ninto an act which was ruinous to his most cherished schemes. The Golden\r\nBull had shown how clearly he appreciated the advantages to a state of\r\nindivisibility and a strict rule of primogeniture. [Sidenote: Partition\r\nof Luxemburg territories.] These advantages he deliberately threw away\r\nin his own case. He even broke the solemn pledge which he had given\r\nnever to separate the marks of Brandenburg from Bohemia. He left Bohemia\r\nand Silesia to his eldest son, Wenzel, while he transferred Brandenburg\r\nto his second son, Sigismund, and formed a duchy in Lausitz for the\r\nthird son, John of Görlitz. Moravia was already in the hands of Jobst\r\nand Prokop, the sons of Charles’s second brother, John Henry; while\r\nLuxemburg was still held by the surviving brother, Wenzel, the husband\r\nof the Duchess of Brabant and Limburg. The family possessions had\r\nincreased enormously since the days of Henry VII., but they were of\r\ncomparatively little value when scattered among so many hands.

This geographical position\r\nhas made the continuance of Switzerland an international necessity. At\r\nthe same time, Swiss history offers to the contemplation of the\r\nscientific historian the most perfect, as it has been the most durable,\r\nof federal constitutions. And this confederation is the more unique and\r\nimportant because it shows how common interests and dangers can hold\r\ntogether communities, not only of different origin and institutions, but\r\nalso of differing race and language. The story of its origin is one of\r\nthe most fascinating episodes in the history of the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of Swiss history have been obscured in two ways: by the\r\npoetical myths which have gradually grown up, and by the theories which\r\nhave been spun in the imagination [Sidenote: Legends as to origin of\r\nSwiss independence.] of patriotic antiquaries. The myths as to the\r\norigin of Swiss independence have long enjoyed a world-wide fame, and it\r\nhas been reserved for the harsh criticism of the nineteenth century to\r\nshow that they had no real historical basis. The story of William Tell\r\nshooting the apple on his child’s head has been proved to be an ancient\r\nlegend of the heroic sagas. The hoisting of the bailiff’s hat in the\r\nmarket-place of Altdorf is an addition of quite recent origin. No\r\nbailiff of the name of Gessler ever existed in the district; and if\r\nthere was a William Tell, which cannot be proved, he was of no political\r\nimportance whatever. Even the more probable and important story of\r\nFürst, Melchthal, and Stauffacher, and of their oath on the field of\r\nRütli, has also been ruthlessly demolished. If these men ever lived and\r\ndid the deeds for which they are renowned, it must have been in some\r\nother place and in quite another relation.\r\n\r\nThe antiquarian theories as to the origin of the Swiss people are quite\r\nas baseless as the legends, and not nearly so interesting. They have\r\nvaried sometimes in their form, but their object has always been to show\r\nthat the Forest Cantons, the earliest members of the league, had some\r\nspecial race origin and some peculiar independence, apart from the rest\r\nof Germany. They were founded, it is said, by settlers from Norway and\r\nSweden, who left their homes for fear of losing their liberties, and\r\nswore to maintain them in a foreign land. All such stories are\r\nabsolutely without foundation. Modern researches have proved, not only\r\nthat the Forest Cantons were members of the Empire like their\r\nneighbours, but that various lords, spiritual and temporal, held\r\ndifferent rights over them at various times. Their constant effort was\r\nto get rid of the authority of these feudal lords, and to vindicate a\r\nposition of direct dependence upon the Empire alone. It was this effort\r\nwhich led to the first formation of a league.\r\n\r\nThe Lake of Luzern, on the shores of which the original Swiss cantons\r\nare situated, lies within the limits of the old duchy of Swabia. The\r\nextinction of the line of dukes left a number of individuals and\r\ncorporations in Swabia without any intermediate lord between them and\r\nthe Emperor. But as the imperial authority declined, and especially\r\nduring the Great Interregnum, the chief families in Swabia set\r\nthemselves to reduce their weaker neighbours to subjection. The most\r\nsuccessful of these [Sidenote: The Hapsburgs in Swabia.] families was\r\nthat of Hapsburg, whose original estates were in the district of Brugg,\r\nat the junction of the Aar and the Reuss. By the middle of the\r\nthirteenth century the family had vastly extended their possessions. In\r\naddition to their lands in the Aargau, they had large territories in the\r\nBreisgau and in Elsass. Rudolf III., born in 1218, set himself to extend\r\nhis power by every possible means—by war, negotiation, and purchase. His\r\navowed object was to restore the territorial unity of Swabia under\r\nHapsburg rule. And if the old duchy had been revived, it would have been\r\ndifficult to intrust it to any other family.\r\n\r\nBut against this aggressive policy was arrayed the desire for local\r\nindependence, of which the most successful champions were the villages\r\nof Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden. [Sidenote: The Forest cantons.] Uri had\r\nbeen granted in 853 by Lewis the German to the abbey of nuns in Zürich,\r\nbut in 1231 the inhabitants had obtained from Frederick II. an\r\nacknowledgment of their independence of any power except the Emperor.\r\nThe other two cantons, without such explicit proofs, had claims which\r\nwere generally acknowledged to a similar position. The endeavour to\r\nmaintain this independence of direct rule must have brought the\r\nvillagers into collision with their powerful neighbour, the Count of\r\nHapsburg. For the moment the struggle was postponed by the news that\r\nRudolf III. had been elected King of the Romans in 1273. Thus he\r\nobtained in his new capacity a suzerainty over the cantons, which they\r\nwere prepared to deny him as Lord of Swabia. The contest must have\r\nseemed hopelessly unequal now that the Hapsburg Count could use his\r\nimperial authority to support his dynastic ambition. But Rudolf’s\r\nattention was diverted from local affairs by his struggle with Ottokar,\r\nby the acquisition of Austria, and by the establishment of his family in\r\nthis new eastern possession. He never relinquished his original aims in\r\nSwabia, but he was no longer able to concentrate his attention on their\r\nachievement. The Hapsburg conquest of Austria was the first foundation\r\nof Swiss independence.\r\n\r\nBut the peasants by the Lake of Luzern showed a clear appreciation of\r\nthe danger that threatened them. In August, 1291, immediately after the\r\ndeath of Rudolf, they [Sidenote: The original League of 1291.] drew up\r\nthe first league of which any record has been preserved. The document\r\nitself is worth quoting:—‘Know all men that we, the people of the valley\r\nof Uri, the community of the valley of Schwyz, and the mountaineers of\r\nthe lower valley, seeing the malice of the times, have solemnly agreed\r\nand bound ourselves by oath to aid and defend each other with all our\r\nmight and main, with our lives and property, both within and without our\r\nboundaries, each at his own expense, against every enemy whatever who\r\nshall attempt to molest us, either singly or collectively. This is our\r\nancient covenant. Whoever hath a lord let him obey him according to his\r\nbounden duty. We have decreed that we will accept no magistrate in our\r\nvalleys who shall have obtained his office for a price, or who is not a\r\nnative and resident among us. Every difference among us shall be decided\r\nby our wisest men; and whoever shall reject their award shall be\r\ncompelled by the other confederates. Whoever shall wilfully commit a\r\nmurder shall suffer death, and he who shall attempt to screen the\r\nmurderer from justice shall be banished from our valleys. An incendiary\r\nshall lose his privileges as a free member of the community, and whoever\r\nharbours him shall make good the damage. Whoever robs or molests another\r\nshall make full restitution out of the property he possesses among us.\r\nEvery one shall acknowledge the authority of a chief magistrate in\r\neither of the valleys. If internal quarrels arise, and one of the\r\nparties shall refuse fair satisfaction, the confederates shall support\r\nthe other party. This covenant, for our common weal, shall, God willing,\r\nendure for ever.’\r\n\r\nIt is obvious from this simple document that the league, at its first\r\norigin, is something more than a mere defensive [Sidenote: Character of\r\nthe League.] alliance. It regulates to a certain extent the punishment\r\nfor crime, probably because endless confusion would arise if different\r\npenalties were enforced in each canton, and a criminal could fly from\r\none to the other. At the same time, there is no complete federal\r\ngovernment formed all at once. There is no mention of a joint assembly\r\nto consider matters of common interest; nor is there any provision for a\r\ncommon taxation for federal purposes. Each canton is to carry on war at\r\nits own expense, and is to furnish, not a fixed contingent, but the\r\nwhole male population capable of bearing arms. The league was not the\r\nwork either of theorists or of experienced politicians, but was drawn up\r\nby three village communities in the face of present danger, and future\r\ndifficulties were left to settle themselves. And the provision about\r\nobedience to a lord proves that the object of the league was to guard\r\nagainst oppression rather than to claim independence. But experience\r\nsoon proved that independence was the only safeguard against oppression.\r\n\r\nLimited as its aims were, the league could hardly have maintained itself\r\nif Rudolf’s eldest son Albert had succeeded his father on the imperial\r\nthrone. And here we [Sidenote: The League confirmed.] may notice the\r\ngood fortune that attended the infant confederacy. If the Hapsburgs had\r\ncontinued to be a mere Swabian family there is little doubt that they\r\nwould have been successful in enforcing their immediate sovereignty. The\r\nelection of Rudolf, and his acquisition of Austria, gave the cantons a\r\nbreathing space in which they could agree upon joint action for their\r\ndefence. The failure of the Hapsburgs to maintain the imperial dignity\r\nwas another piece of luck for the allies. It gave them powerful allies\r\nand a pretext for adhering to their claim of direct dependence upon the\r\nEmpire. They reaped an immediate advantage from the election of Adolf of\r\nNassau on the death of Rudolf. Adolf, eager to weaken his rival, Albert\r\nof Austria, at once confirmed the league of 1291, and promised it\r\nimperial protection. But the fall of Adolf and the election of Albert\r\nagain put the confederates in a very dangerous position. It is to\r\nAlbert’s reign that the tyranny of bailiffs, like Gessler, is\r\nattributed. But these stories have no contemporary authority. Albert\r\ncertainly appointed bailiffs by virtue of his imperial authority, but we\r\nhave no record that he appointed aliens, or that his bailiffs were\r\ntyrannical. In fact, Albert, like his father, had his hands full with\r\nimperial affairs, and had no time to devote himself to his interests in\r\nSwabia. The league remained passive during his reign, and wisely gave\r\nhim no pretext for hostile interference. Had Albert’s son succeeded to\r\nthe Empire, the Forest Cantons would probably have been gradually\r\nabsorbed in the Hapsburg dominions. But here again their good fortune\r\ncame to their aid. After Albert’s death the imperial crown was withheld\r\nfrom his House for several generations. The Luxemburg and Bavarian\r\nEmperors were for the most part hostile to the Austrian dukes, and were\r\nnot unwilling to strengthen the opposition to them in Swabia.\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of Henry VII. was to grant to the league the most\r\nample confirmation of their sole dependence upon the Empire and complete\r\nexemption from all foreign jurisdiction. In return for this they sent\r\nthree hundred soldiers to accompany the Emperor on his Italian\r\ncampaign—the first occasion on which Swiss troops served outside their\r\nown country. In the struggle between Lewis the Bavarian and Frederick of\r\nAustria the confederates naturally adopted the side of the former.\r\nLeopold, Frederick’s brother, determined to punish the rebellious and\r\naudacious peasants, as he called them. There is a legendary account of\r\nthe great battle between the opposing [Sidenote: Battle of Morgarten,\r\n1315.] forces; but all that is known is that Leopold’s men-at-arms\r\nallowed themselves to be attacked in a narrow valley at Morgarten, where\r\nthey had no room for evolution, and the Swiss, having first thrown them\r\ninto confusion by a shower of stones and other missiles, routed them at\r\nthe first down-hill charge. This is the first of the great fights which\r\nshowed the Swiss to be invincible on their own ground, and trained them\r\nto become for a time the finest infantry in Europe. The victory was\r\ncelebrated by the formal renewal of the league at the village of\r\nBrunnen; Lewis the Bavarian recognised the value of the service to his\r\ncause by confirming the edict of Henry VII.; and by a treaty in 1318 the\r\nHapsburgs withdrew all claims to administrative authority within the\r\nlimits of the Forest Cantons. The league was now a recognised and\r\nsuccessful body to which its neighbours could look for aid in an\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nThe nearest, and for that reason the most important, of these neighbours\r\nwas the town of Luzern, which had grown [Sidenote: Luzern joins the\r\nLeague, 1330.] up in the territory and under the protection of the abbey\r\nof Murbach. As the town grew in power and wealth, the direct ownership\r\nof the abbey was broken off, but the monks retained in their hands the\r\nappointment of chief magistrate until it was purchased from them by\r\nRudolf of Hapsburg. The buying up of similar rights was one of the chief\r\nmethods by which he sought to extend his ascendency in Swabia. From that\r\ntime Luzern had acknowledged some measure of subjection to the\r\nHapsburgs, and had aided them with men and money in their struggle with\r\nLewis the Bavarian. But the demands of their overlords became more and\r\nmore onerous, and growing discontent seems to have impelled the citizens\r\nto seek the support of the neighbouring villages. On December 7, 1330,\r\nLuzern was formally admitted to the league, and this completed the union\r\nof the four Forest Cantons.\r\n\r\nThere was in this no express defiance of the Hapsburgs, whose rights,\r\njurisdiction, and feudal prerogatives were expressly reserved in the\r\ntreaty, nor was any change made in the oligarchical government of\r\nLuzern. But in time it was inevitable that the citizens should be\r\ninfluenced by the independence and the democratic constitution of their\r\nallies. The burgher nobles formed a conspiracy in 1343 to break off the\r\ncompact with the three original cantons. The legend tells that the plot\r\nwas overheard by a boy, who was discovered and pledged to secrecy.\r\n[Sidenote: Revolution in Luzern.] He kept the letter of his promise by\r\ntelling the secret to a stove in a room where the butchers’ guild was\r\nholding a meeting. The citizens were alarmed, and the conspirators\r\narrested; and the result was that not only did Luzern remain a member of\r\nthe league, but a new executive council was created of 300 members,\r\nwhile the power of levying taxes, making war and concluding peace, was\r\nvested in the whole community. Thus the exclusive oligarchy was\r\noverthrown.\r\n\r\nTwo other cities, Zürich and Bern, though farther distant than Luzern,\r\nwere destined to play a more prominent part in the history of the\r\nleague. Zürich was in the fourteenth century a free imperial city, and\r\nowed no obedience to any intermediate lord. The government was a close\r\noligarchy, as the council consisted of thirty-six members, all of whom\r\nbelonged to the old burgher families. As long as their power remained\r\nunshaken, there was little likelihood of any close connection with the\r\npeasants of the original cantons. But Zürich, like so many other towns\r\nat the time, underwent a revolution. The artisans, organised in their\r\nown guilds, were stirred up to dispute the exclusive rule of the old\r\nburghers. The leader of the revolution was Rudolf [Sidenote: Rudolf Brun\r\nin Zürich.] Brun, one of the most remarkable demagogues of a century\r\nwhich produced Rienzi, Marcel, and the Arteveldes. Brun was himself a\r\nmember of the ruling class, but sought to gratify his own ambition by\r\nturning against it. In 1336 the political change was accomplished. The\r\nmembers of the council were intimidated into flight, and a mass meeting\r\ndecreed that the government should be reformed, and that in the meantime\r\nBrun should hold supreme power. Before long the new constitution was\r\npromulgated. Brun was appointed burgomaster for life with the assistance\r\nof a council of twenty-six. Thirteen of these were to be nominees of the\r\nburgomaster—six nobles and seven plebeians; the other thirteen were the\r\ntribunes of the guilds. For the next fifteen years Rudolf Brun was\r\npractically despot in Zürich, but it was not until his authority was\r\nseriously threatened that he had any inducement to ally himself with\r\nsuch sturdy opponents of personal rule as the inhabitants of the Forest\r\nCantons.\r\n\r\nThe undisguised despotism of Brun not unnaturally provoked a reaction in\r\nZürich, and the members of the dispossessed [Sidenote: Zürich joins the\r\nLeague, 1351.] oligarchy were encouraged to intrigue for his overthrow.\r\nThey found zealous supporters among the nobles outside the walls,\r\nespecially in John of Hapsburg, Count of Rapperschwyl, a cousin of the\r\nAustrian dukes. The story of the discovery of the plot is strangely\r\nreminiscent of the similar incident in the history of Luzern. A baker’s\r\nboy overheard the incautious conspirators, and informed his master. Brun\r\nwas warned, and the rising was ruthlessly suppressed. All citizens\r\nsuspected of disaffection were put to death, John of Hapsburg was\r\nimprisoned, and his town of Rapperschwyl was razed to the ground. But\r\nthis act provoked the anger of the Austrian Hapsburgs, and to protect\r\nhimself against their threatened vengeance, Brun found himself compelled\r\nto secure the alliance of the Forest Cantons. The agreement of May 2,\r\n1351, is of great importance, as showing a marked progress towards\r\nfederation, and also because its provisions gave rise to many subsequent\r\ndifficulties. ‘We, the cantons of Zürich, Luzern, Uri, Schwyz, and\r\nUnterwalden, do hereby enter into a firm and perpetual union: we engage\r\nto assist each other with our lives and fortunes against all who shall\r\nin any ways attempt to injure us in our honour, property, or freedom:\r\nthis we bind ourselves to perform at all times and in all places within\r\nthe Aar, the Thur, the Rhine, and Mount St. Gothard. Whenever the\r\ncouncil or community that calls for aid shall declare upon oath that the\r\ncase is urgent, each canton shall, without evasion or delay, and at its\r\nown cost, send the demanded aid. In great emergencies, such as a distant\r\nmarch or a long campaign, the cantons shall hold a congress at\r\nEinsiedeln and there deliberate on the measures to be pursued. We, the\r\nconfederate cantons, solemnly reserve all the rights of the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire and its sovereign, and each of us his previous alliances. Each\r\ncanton may form new alliances, but not to the prejudice of the league.\r\nWe will jointly preserve the burgomaster and the constitution of Zürich.\r\nShould (_quod Deus avortat_) any dissension arise between Zürich and the\r\nForest Cantons, the city shall send two good and wise men, and the\r\ncantons two others, to Einsiedeln, and these four shall, on oath, decide\r\nthe difference: if their votes are equal, they shall chose a fifth\r\nassociate from any canton, and he shall give the casting vote.’ The\r\nprogress towards federalism is shown in the provisions for conference\r\nand arbitration; while the diplomacy of Rudolf Brun is evident in the\r\nclauses by which a canton is enabled to form separate alliances, and the\r\nForest Cantons are pledged to uphold the existing constitution of\r\nZürich.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Albert the Lame of Austria, the last survivor of the numerous\r\nsons of Albert I.,[8] was arming to avenge the injury done to his\r\nkinsman and to vindicate Hapsburg rights in Swabia. In 1352 his troops\r\nadvanced to the siege of Zürich, and the neighbouring towns and villages\r\nwere called upon to send aid to the invaders. The people of Glarus, not\r\nfar from Zürich, were dependent upon the abbey [Sidenote: Accession of\r\nGlarus, 1352.] of Seckingen, and the administration was in the hands of\r\na steward appointed by the abbess. The Counts of Hapsburg had acquired,\r\nmore than a century before, the position of advocate, or military\r\nchampion, of the abbey, and this gave them a claim to the feudal service\r\nof the people of Glarus. But to the demands of Albert II. they replied\r\nthat they were only bound to serve in the interests of the abbey of\r\nSeckingen, and refused to fight in a private quarrel of the duke. Albert\r\nat once sent a body of troops to coerce Glarus, but the inhabitants\r\nobtained the assistance of the Forest Cantons and repulsed them. The\r\nresult was the conclusion of a permanent league between Glarus and its\r\nallies. The rights and revenues of both duke and abbess were expressly\r\nreserved in the treaty, and the people of Glarus promised to make no new\r\nalliances without the concurrence of the confederates.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the league made its first conquest. Hitherto the\r\nvarious members had joined of their own accord; but now the league took\r\nthe offensive, and to secure their own safety compelled the little town\r\nof Zug to join them. Zug lies between Zürich [Sidenote: Conquest of Zug,\r\n1352.] and the Lake of Luzern, and was occupied by an Austrian garrison.\r\nThe inhabitants of Schwyz marched to the walls and demanded its\r\nsurrender, declaring that they had no intention to diminish the\r\nauthority of the Duke of Austria or to change the constitution of Zug.\r\nAs no aid came from Albert II., the townsmen found it necessary to\r\nsubmit, and were formally admitted to the league.\r\n\r\nThe expedition of Albert was thus a complete failure, and the campaign\r\nof 1352 was closed by a hollow treaty. All prisoners were to be\r\nreleased, and all hostages [Sidenote: Treaty of 1352.] and plunder\r\nreturned. Zug and Glarus were to pay the duke their accustomed\r\nallegiance. The confederates were pledged in the future to conclude no\r\nalliance with Austrian vassals: nor were Luzern and Zürich to admit such\r\nvassals to their citizenship. But all former alliances, immunities, and\r\nestablished regulations were to remain in force. The terms were perhaps\r\nintentionally ambiguous. The Austrian duke contended that they involved\r\nthe separation of Zug and Glarus from the league, while the confederates\r\nheld that the last clause entitled them to maintain the alliance. But\r\nthough the treaty itself was but a doubtful gain, it was followed by a\r\nvery great accession of strength to the league. A successful embassy was\r\nsent to invite the adhesion of the powerful city of Bern, and a\r\n[Sidenote: Bern joins the League, 1353.] treaty was arranged at the\r\nbeginning of 1353. The direct alliance is made with the three original\r\ncantons; Zürich and Luzern being only indirectly involved, while Glarus\r\nand Zug are not mentioned at all. ‘The Swiss of the three Forest Cantons\r\nshall be assisted by Bern, whenever they shall be in need: and the\r\ncantons in return undertake to defend the city of Bern, its burghers,\r\nand all its property.... We, the Bernese, promise to assist Zürich and\r\nLuzern, when required by our Swiss confederates: we, of Zürich and\r\nLuzern, promise that whenever Bern shall be attacked and its council\r\nshall send to the Forest Cantons for aid, we will at our own expense\r\nimmediately march to its assistance.’\r\n\r\nThe accession of Bern completes the number of the eight old cantons; and\r\nthe league had grown to these dimensions [Sidenote: The eight old\r\nCantons.] in just over sixty years, from 1291 to 1353. But it is obvious\r\nthat as yet there were little more than the elements of a federation.\r\nThere was no central government, and no supreme court of justice. The\r\nallies stood on various and unequal terms with each other, and some were\r\nnot connected at all. Bern was not directly allied with Zürich or\r\nLuzern, and not allied at all with Glarus and Zug. Glarus and Zug had no\r\nconnection with each other, and the former had made more submissive\r\nterms than any other canton. Moreover, differences in constitution\r\nprevented the various members of the league from regarding political\r\nquestions in the same light. Bern maintained its exclusive aristocracy,\r\nZürich and Luzern had adopted a mixed constitution, while the three\r\noriginal cantons, with Zug and Glarus, were pure democracies, in which\r\nevery adult male had a share in political power.\r\n\r\nIf all danger from the Austrian dukes had come to an end in 1353, it is\r\nprobable that this ill-cemented league would [Sidenote: Continued danger\r\nfrom Austria.] have fallen to pieces. But as long as the Hapsburgs\r\nremained great landholders in Swabia, their weaker neighbours were in\r\ndanger of absorption, and it was this which ultimately hardened the\r\nleague into a lasting federation. Albert II. was resolute to enforce his\r\ninterpretation of the treaty of 1352. In 1354 he demanded that Glarus\r\nand Zug should renounce their alliance with the other cantons. The\r\nleague appealed to the Emperor, but Charles IV. was pledged to the\r\npolicy of discountenancing such associations, and he gave his support to\r\nthe Hapsburg claims. And Albert had another advantage in the\r\nself-seeking policy pursued by Rudolf Brun, who was still supreme in\r\nZürich, and who was quite ready to make terms with Austria if he could\r\nthereby strengthen his own position. The influence of Zürich nearly\r\ninduced the Forest Cantons to accept a treaty which would have involved\r\na surrender of the most vital points at issue, and it was only at the\r\nlast minute that the apparent treachery was discovered. The result was a\r\ncoolness between Zürich and the confederates, and the former went so far\r\nas to conclude a separate treaty with the Austrian duke. Fortunately\r\nAlbert II. was too old and worn out to profit by this disunion, and just\r\nbefore his death he concluded a truce for eleven years with the league,\r\nleaving matters _in statu quo_ for the time.\r\n\r\nAlbert the Lame died in 1358 leaving behind him four sons, who were born\r\nafter he had been married for nineteen years without issue, and when the\r\nextinction of the main line of his House seemed imminent. Before his\r\ndeath he made an arrangement that his territories should pass undivided\r\nto the joint rule of his four sons. The second son, Frederick, died soon\r\nafter his father, and the third son, Albert, preferred the study of\r\nphilosophy to the cares of politics. The two active members of the\r\nfamily were the eldest son, Rudolf, and the youngest, Leopold.\r\n[Sidenote: Rudolf IV. in Swabia.] Rudolf married the daughter of Charles\r\nIV., quarrelled with his father-in-law about the elevation of the\r\nelectors, and was only reconciled on being allowed to annex the province\r\nof Tyrol (see p. 120). In his Swabian dominions he showed himself an\r\nactive and capable ruler. He retained the support of Rudolf Brun, to\r\nwhom he granted a pension and the title of privy councillor. He bought\r\nup the territory of Rapperschwyl, thus thrusting in a wedge between the\r\nlake of Zürich and the Forest Cantons. On pretence of aiding the\r\npilgrims to Einsiedeln, he built a magnificent wooden bridge over the\r\nlake, which was regarded by contemporaries as one of the wonders of the\r\nworld. His real object was to get into his hands the control of the\r\nchief highway between Italy and Germany. His restless activity would\r\ncertainly have brought him, sooner or later, into collision with the\r\nSwiss, but in the midst of his schemes he died suddenly in 1365, when he\r\nwas only twenty-six years old.\r\n\r\nOf the two surviving brothers, Albert III. and Leopold, the latter had\r\nbeen the confidant of Rudolf’s ambitious schemes, [Sidenote: Leopold II.\r\nin Swabia.] and was eager to carry them out. With this object he induced\r\nhis brother to revive the practice of partition, and to content himself\r\nwith the duchy of Austria. Leopold received as his share Styria,\r\nCarinthia, Tyrol, and the Swabian lands. It was to Swabia that he\r\ndevoted most of his attention. On every side he purchased territorial\r\nand other rights. His aim was that of his great-grandfather: the\r\nformation of a strong and united Swabian principality in Hapsburg hands.\r\nIn the pursuit of such an aim he was inevitably brought into collision\r\nwith the Swiss.\r\n\r\nOne of Leopold’s most conspicuous successes was the obtaining from\r\nWenzel, the feeble successor of Charles IV., the office of imperial\r\nadvocate in Upper and Lower Swabia. He soon found himself involved in\r\ngrave difficulties. To make head against the Swabian league of towns,\r\nthe princes and knights were forced to form confederations among\r\nthemselves. In such a state of things local collisions were frequent,\r\nand there seemed the possibility of a great war of [Sidenote: Renewal of\r\nwar.] classes. The Swiss naturally supported the Swabian League, and\r\nLeopold, after a vain struggle to act as arbiter between the hostile\r\nforces, found himself forced by Swiss aggression to throw himself on the\r\nopposite side. The forces of the neighbouring nobles flocked to his\r\nbanner at Baden in Aargau, and as the Swabian League failed to send any\r\nassistance to the Swiss, Leopold seemed to have good reason to expect a\r\ncomplete and easy victory. But the Swiss, who had defiantly broken the\r\ntreaty of 1352, were conscious that the struggle was one for liberty or\r\nsubjection. Rudolf Brun was dead, and Zürich had returned to complete\r\nharmony with the confederates. No effort was spared to collect forces,\r\nand the [Sidenote: Battle of Sempach, 1386.] Swiss victory at Sempach,\r\nJuly 9, 1386, was even more decisive, if more hardly won, than that of\r\nMorgarten. Leopold himself, fighting with reckless ardour to redeem the\r\nfortunes of the day, fell upon the field. His death virtually decided\r\nthe war. It is true that the Swiss had to fight and win another battle\r\nat Näfels, before they could force their opponents to terms. But the\r\ntreaty of 1389 [Sidenote: Treaty of 1389.] was as complete as any Swiss\r\npatriot of those days could desire. The sons of Leopold renounced all\r\nfeudal claims, direct or indirect, over Luzern, Glarus, or Zug. Thus\r\nwithin a hundred years from the formation of the league of 1291, the\r\nSwiss had succeeded in obtaining for the whole territory comprised in\r\nthe extended confederacy that position of dependence upon the Empire\r\nalone, which had been the first aim of the Forest Cantons.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  See Genealogical Table C, in Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n               ITALY IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY, 1313-1402\r\n\r\n\r\n    Guelfs and Ghibellines—Equality of parties leads to foreign\r\n    intervention—Lewis the Bavarian—John of Bohemia—League against\r\n    Mastino della Scala—Walter de Brienne in Florence—Rise of\r\n    mercenaries—Foreign and native Condottieri—Joanna I. of\r\n    Naples—Succession disputes in Naples—Rome and the Papal\r\n    States—Career of Rienzi—Cardinal Albornoz recovers the Papal\r\n    States—Return of the Popes to Rome and outbreak of the Great\r\n    Schism—Strife of classes and families in Florence—Rising of the\r\n    _Ciompi_—Revolution of 1382 and triumph of the oligarchy in\r\n    Florence—Rivalry of Venice and Genoa—War of Chioggia—The Visconti in\r\n    Milan—Successes of Gian Galeazzo Visconti—His death.\r\n\r\nThe death of Henry VII. marks the failure of the last serious effort on\r\nthe part of a German king to carry out the ideal of [Sidenote: Guelfs\r\nand Ghibellines.] Dante’s _De Monarchia_ by establishing an efficient\r\nmonarchy in Italy. A few years earlier the Papacy, which had done more\r\nthan any other power to thwart the imperial pretensions, had almost\r\ndeliberately weakened its authority by transferring its residence to the\r\nbanks of the Rhône. It seemed as if Italy might for a time be freed from\r\nthe rivalry of the two claimants to universal rule, whose quarrel had\r\ndone so much to cause discord and anarchy in the peninsula. But it is\r\none of the numerous anomalies of Italian history that the factions of\r\nGuelfs and Ghibellines continue their feuds with the same vigour and\r\nanimosity as in the days when each had a substantial cause to fight for.\r\nYet beneath these feuds we can trace a growing undercurrent of political\r\ninterests and of selfish aggrandisement, which gradually led to the\r\nabsorption of the lesser states by their more powerful neighbours, and\r\nultimately to the formation of the five greater powers whose rivalry\r\nfills the history of the next century. The example was set by Venice,\r\n[Sidenote: Venetian policy.] whose geographical position removed her\r\nfrom the main current of party strife, while her interests were more\r\nstrictly defined than those of any other state. In the east she had to\r\nmaintain and extend her trade and her influence against the rivalry of\r\nGenoa; and she had also to face the serious problems raised by the\r\nsteady decline of the Eastern Empire and the constant aggressions of the\r\nTurks. In the west she had not yet acquired any territory on the\r\nmainland, but two pressing interests compelled her to keep a watchful\r\neye on the politics of Lombardy. She could not with safety allow any\r\ncontinental power to obtain complete control of the Alpine passes\r\nthrough which Venetian merchandise found its way to the markets of\r\nCentral Europe. Still less could she neglect the imperative need of\r\nsecuring supplies of food. Built upon the small islands of the lagoons,\r\nshe could not possibly raise enough produce to feed her citizens, and\r\nwas necessarily dependent upon importations from eastern Lombardy or\r\nDalmatia. If a hostile power could cut off these supplies, Venice must\r\nbe speedily starved into surrender. This double interest forced Venice\r\nto play a more prominent part in Italian politics than her isolated\r\nposition seemed to warrant, and in the end impelled her to join in the\r\nscramble for territory on the mainland.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Venice, all the Italian states were more or less\r\ninvolved in the strife of factions. In the south [Sidenote: Balance of\r\nparties.] Robert of Naples, relying upon Papal and French support, still\r\nheld the Guelf leadership, and still aimed, like his grandfather, at\r\nconverting this leadership into a kingdom of Italy. But the Angevin\r\npower was no longer what it had been in the days of Charles I. The\r\nSicilian Vespers had given Sicily to a hostile dynasty, and the Popes in\r\nAvignon were less valuable allies than their predecessors in Rome. In\r\nthe north lay the main strength of the Ghibelline party. Despots, like\r\nMatteo Visconti in Milan and Cangrande della Scala in Verona, were\r\nrapidly overthrowing the republican independence of the Lombard cities,\r\nand these men had no legal basis for their authority save their\r\nappointment as imperial vicars. Between Naples and Lombardy lay the\r\nPapal States and Tuscany. In the former, the Popes continued to employ\r\nwhat authority they could wield through their legates on the Guelf and\r\nAngevin side. But the decline of their direct authority led to the rise\r\nof petty despots in cities which were nominally papal fiefs, and these\r\ndespots, desiring the maximum of independence for themselves, naturally\r\nleaned towards Ghibellinism. In Tuscany there was also a marked\r\ndivision. Florence was the head of a group of communes which retained\r\nrepublican institutions and were ardently Guelf in sympathy. But Pisa,\r\nalso a republic, was equally resolute on the Ghibelline side.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the two parties were so evenly matched in strength, that it\r\nwas difficult for either to resist the temptation of trying to turn the\r\nbalance in its own favour by [Sidenote: Foreign intervention in Italy.]\r\ncalling in foreign assistance. It is true that a number of writers,\r\nincluding Sismondi, have represented the Guelfs as the national and the\r\nGhibellines as the anti-national party. But this view involves both a\r\nmisconception of the mediæval empire, and also the anachronism of\r\nassuming a sense of nationality to exist in Italy at a time when no such\r\nidea was possible. The only sentiment which could vie with devotion to\r\nparty was patriotism; but patriotism beyond the bounds of his own city\r\nwas as unknown to a citizen of Florence or Milan as it was to an\r\nAthenian or a Spartan in the days of Greek independence. Robert of\r\nNaples was as much a foreigner to a native of Lombardy or Tuscany as\r\nLewis the Bavarian, and the king of France was much more so. As long as\r\nparty spirit was the strongest force in Italy, we can trace a succession\r\nof appeals for foreign intervention: and when party spirit finally gave\r\nway to the rivalry of state with state, this intervention grew into\r\nconquest and occupation.\r\n\r\nHenry VII. in the last struggle before his death had clearly and\r\ncorrectly perceived that the key to the situation was in [Sidenote:\r\nStruggle in Tuscany.] Tuscany, that if the Ghibelline cause could\r\ntriumph in that province the overthrow of the Guelfs might be\r\nconfidently expected. And not long after his death the desired state of\r\nthings seemed not unlikely to be realised. One of the most famous\r\nadventurers of the age, Castruccio Castracani, who had risen to\r\nprominence by his military ability, made himself lord of Lucca and there\r\nbecame a formidable neighbour to Florence. In 1325 he reduced the\r\nintermediate town of Pistoia, and defeated the Florentine forces at\r\nAltopascio. So terrified were the Florentines that they resolved to\r\nsacrifice their independence as the price of safety and the victory of\r\ntheir party. They offered the lordship of the city to Robert of Naples,\r\nwho accepted it for his only son, Charles of Calabria. The progress of\r\nCastruccio was checked, and the appearance of Neapolitan forces in\r\nTuscany impelled the Ghibelline leaders to call in the assistance of\r\nLewis of Bavaria (_vide_ p. 104). Lewis [Sidenote: Lewis the Bavarian in\r\nItaly.] entered Italy in 1327, but his coming brought little real gain\r\nto his allies. In Milan he imprisoned his host, Galeazzo Visconti, and\r\nrestored to the citizens a mockery of republican independence. Pisa, in\r\nspite of her Ghibelline traditions, stood a month’s siege before she\r\nwould open her gates to a prince who might hand her over as a reward to\r\nhis chief supporter Castruccio Castracani. No attempt was made to attack\r\nthe Duke of Calabria in Florence, and Lewis hurried on to Rome. There he\r\nwas crowned emperor. John XXII. was deposed as a heretic, and an\r\nAntipope was elected. Castruccio was formally created Duke of Lucca,\r\nPistoia, and Volterra. But the news came that the Florentines had\r\ncaptured Pistoia by stratagem, and Castruccio had to hurry north for the\r\ndefence of his duchy. He was indignant that Lewis had given the lordship\r\nof Pisa to the empress, and in defiance of imperial authority he took\r\nmeasures to secure his own rule in the city. From Pisa he advanced to a\r\nsuccessful siege of Pistoia, but he died almost immediately after\r\n(September 3, 1328) of a fever contracted in the trenches.\r\n\r\nThe death of Castruccio and the humiliating failure of Lewis the\r\nBavarian, who was forced to evacuate Rome in the autumn of 1328,\r\ndeprived the Ghibellines of the advantages which they had secured in the\r\nearly part of the year. Lucca, which had threatened to subdue both\r\nFlorence and Pisa, became a prize for which many states and adventurers\r\ncontended. But the Guelfs did not profit as much as might have been\r\nexpected from the disasters of their opponents. Charles of Calabria,\r\nhaving served the purpose of the Florentines by saving them from\r\nCastruccio, died on November 9, 1328, and Florence recovered her\r\nindependence. Robert of Naples, profoundly discouraged by the death of\r\nhis only son, abandoned most of his ambitious projects and ceased to\r\ninterfere in the politics of northern Italy. Soon afterwards the emperor\r\nfound it necessary to leave Italy in order to look after his interests\r\nin Germany. Before his departure he restored Milan to the rule of Azzo\r\nVisconti, the son of the deposed Galeazzo, who had perished, like\r\nCastruccio, of a disease contracted during the siege of Pistoia.\r\n\r\nThe departure of Lewis and the inactivity of the Neapolitan king left\r\nthe parties in northern Italy to fight out their quarrels without\r\nforeign aid. The Ghibellines had lost their short-lived ascendency in\r\nTuscany, but they were still omnipotent on the Lombard plain. By far the\r\nmost powerful Ghibelline prince at this time was [Sidenote: Power of\r\nMastino della Scala.] Mastino della Scala, who in 1329 had succeeded his\r\nuncle Cangrande in the government of Verona. Cangrande, a typical\r\nItalian despot in his combination of relentless cruelty with the\r\npatronage of letters, had established a strong territorial power in\r\neastern Lombardy. He had forced Marsilio Carrara to govern Padua as his\r\nlieutenant, while he had brought into direct submission the towns of\r\nVicenza, Feltre, Belluno, and Treviso, and was thus enabled to control\r\nthe most important eastern passes through the Alps. Mastino inherited\r\nhis uncle’s ambition with his territories, and on receiving an appeal\r\nfor aid from the Ghibelline exiles of Brescia, he eagerly seized the\r\npretext for laying siege to that city. This aggression led to the most\r\ninteresting and unique instance of foreign intervention in Italy. John\r\nof Bohemia [Sidenote: John of Bohemia.] (_vide_ p. 18) happened to be at\r\nthe moment on the Italian borders at Trent, negotiating the marriage of\r\nhis second son with the heiress of Tyrol, Margaret Maultasch (_vide_ p.\r\n107). He had never taken part in Italian politics, but he enjoyed a\r\nbrilliant reputation in Europe, and there was much in his position to\r\nattract the attention of the Italians. He was known to be on the most\r\nintimate terms with the Pope and the French king, both patrons of the\r\nGuelf cause. At the same time, as the son of Henry VII., he had strong\r\nclaims on the allegiance of the Ghibellines. If any man could act as a\r\nmediator in the party feuds of Italy, it was the head of the house of\r\nLuxemburg.\r\n\r\nTo King John the besieged Brescians appealed for assistance, and offered\r\nin return the sovereignty over the city. [Sidenote: Successes of John in\r\nItaly.] The prospect of a new field for adventure was more than John\r\ncould resist. He ordered levies to be collected in Bohemia, and warned\r\nMastino della Scala to desist from attacking a city which owned his\r\nlordship. Mastino obeyed on condition that the Ghibelline exiles should\r\nbe restored; and this promise, to the great chagrin of the dominant\r\nparty in Brescia, the king fulfilled. On his entry into the city\r\n(December 31, 1330) John announced that he would belong to no party,\r\nthat his one aim was to restore peace and justice, and that he hoped\r\nthat before long there would be no more Guelfs and Ghibellines. The\r\nimmediate effect of such unprecedented language was almost magical. The\r\nItalians, exhausted with continual party warfare, welcomed as a\r\nprotecting angel the prince who promised impartiality. One after another\r\nthe cities of northern Italy, Bergamo, Cremona, Pavia, Vercelli, and\r\nNovara, placed themselves under the rule of John of Bohemia. Even Azzo\r\nVisconti, the powerful lord of Milan, found it advisable to acknowledge\r\nthe suzerainty of the king, and to accept the title of royal vicar. Soon\r\nafterwards John’s dominions were extended southwards by the submission\r\nof Parma, Reggio, Modena, and the unfortunate Lucca, which had been\r\ntossed from hand to hand since the death of Castruccio Castracani. In\r\nevery case the exiles, of either faction, were allowed to return, and\r\nthe government was established without any regard to party divisions.\r\nFor a moment it seemed that the spontaneous action of the Italians\r\nthemselves might create the monarchy that had so long seemed an\r\nimpossible dream.\r\n\r\nBut John’s success was too sudden to be lasting. Party enmities were too\r\ndeeply rooted to be torn up at the first [Sidenote: Opposition to John.]\r\neffort. Men began to ask in whose name had he come; did he represent the\r\nEmperor or the Pope? An appeal to these potentates produced only\r\nnegative answers. John XXII. was indignant with the king for restoring\r\nthe Ghibelline exiles in Guelf strongholds; Lewis was jealous that a\r\nrival should succeed where he had failed. And John had enemies both in\r\nItaly and outside. Mastino della Scala felt himself threatened by the\r\nrise of a conterminous principality in Lombardy, and Florence was afraid\r\nlest a power which extended so far as Lucca might endanger her own\r\nindependence. In the north the dukes of Austria and the kings of Poland\r\nand Hungary formed a league against him, and John had to cross the Alps\r\nfor the defence of Bohemia. His absence only hastened the destruction of\r\na dominion that rested on too shallow a foundation to endure. If he had\r\nsucceeded for a moment in uniting Guelfs and Ghibellines under his rule,\r\na still more wonderful union was brought about for his overthrow. In\r\n1332 the strange spectacle was seen of a close league of Florence and\r\nNaples with Azzo Visconti, Mastino della Scala, and other Ghibelline\r\nprinces of the north. Mastino had already succeeded in capturing\r\nBrescia, and Azzo had seized upon Bergamo and Vercelli. The rest of\r\nJohn’s possessions were to be partitioned among the allies. Cremona was\r\nto go to Visconti, Parma to Mastino, Modena to the house of Este, Reggio\r\nto the Gonzagas of Mantua, and Lucca to the Florentines.\r\n\r\nJohn of Bohemia had succeeded in dividing the northern league, and had\r\nproceeded to France and Avignon in order to secure the support of Philip\r\nVI. and the Pope. He now hurried back to the aid of his son Charles,\r\nwhom he had left in charge of his Italian dominions. But he found that\r\nhe had no sufficient native support to [Sidenote: Collapse of his\r\npower.] enable him to face the hostile coalition. The two parties whom\r\nhe had tried to conciliate were now united in opposition. He had few\r\nreal interests at stake in Italy, whither he had been mainly attracted\r\nby the love of adventure. Instead of prosecuting the struggle, he sold\r\nhis prerogatives in each town to the highest bidder he could find, and\r\nquitted Italy with his son in 1333. The episode is interesting as\r\nthrowing light on the character of John, and on the impulsive character\r\nof the Italians, but in an indirect way it was of unforeseen importance.\r\nThe future emperor, Charles IV., never forgot the experience of Italian\r\npolitics which he had obtained during the two years in which he acted as\r\nhis father’s deputy, and one of the dominant influences which shaped his\r\nsubsequent policy in Germany (see chapter vi.), was a desire to save\r\nthat country from falling into the same condition as Italy.\r\n\r\nThe chief gainers by the overthrow of John of Bohemia were the\r\nGhibelline leaders of the confederacy against him, [Sidenote: League\r\nagainst Mastino della Scala.] and especially Mastino della Scala, who\r\nnot only took his own share of the plunder, but refused to give up\r\nLucca, which should have fallen to Florence. It was reckoned by\r\ncontemporaries that only one European prince, the king of France, drew a\r\nlarger revenue from his subjects than the lord of Verona. But the rapid\r\ngrowth of his power only served to excite the enmity of his neighbours.\r\nVenice was impelled by self-interest to attack a potentate who not only\r\ndominated the district from which the republic drew its most available\r\nsupplies of food, but also commanded the all-important Alpine passes.\r\nFlorence was eager to punish the ill-faith which withheld from her the\r\ncoveted possession of Lucca. Marsilio Carrara was tempted by the\r\nprospect of recovering the independent lordship of Padua, while Azzo\r\nVisconti and the other Lombard despots welcomed the opportunity of\r\ndestroying the ascendency in Lombardy which for the last decade had been\r\nenjoyed by the Scaligers. The result was the formation of a powerful\r\nleague which Mastino was unable to resist. In 1338 he was forced to\r\nconclude a treaty which put an end to the preponderance of Verona in the\r\nnorth. Venice received Treviso, with the adjacent territory, Castelbaldo\r\nand Bassano, thus securing a land fertile in corn and cattle, and at the\r\nsame time access to the foot of the Alps. The Carrara dynasty was\r\nestablished in Padua as a buffer between Venice and the growing power of\r\nthe Visconti, who seized Brescia and Bergamo. Only Verona and Vicenza\r\nremained to the house of Scala.\r\n\r\nBut the unfortunate Florentines were again duped of the reward which\r\nshould have attended their alliance with the Ghibelline princes. Lucca\r\nwas indeed ceded by Mastino for a money payment, but the Pisans\r\nintervened to prevent such an addition to the dominions of their rivals.\r\nIn 1341 the Pisans defeated the forces of Florence, and in the next year\r\nthey obtained the surrender of Lucca. This disappointment was the last\r\nof a series of disasters which weakened and discredited the government\r\nof the _popolo grasso_ in Florence (_vide_ p. 32). In their chagrin the\r\ncitizens resorted to the expedient, so familiar in the mediæval history\r\nof Italy, of intrusting a temporary dictatorship to a foreigner. Their\r\nchoice fell upon Walter [Sidenote: Walter de Brienne in Florence, 1343.]\r\nde Brienne, who had previously been active in Florence as a follower of\r\nCharles of Calabria. His ancestors had gained the duchy of Athens at the\r\ntime when the Fourth Crusade had given to western princes the dominion\r\nof the eastern empire, and though his father had been forced to resign\r\nin 1312, Walter still called himself Duke of Athens. The temporary\r\nmilitary and judicial authority intrusted to the duke failed to satisfy\r\nhis ambition, and he set himself to establish a permanent despotism in\r\nFlorence. It was not difficult for him to gain over the _grandi_ and the\r\nlower classes, who were jealous of the monopoly of power claimed by the\r\nwealthy burgesses. With their aid a parliament was convoked which\r\ninsisted on voting the signory to the duke for his life. But ten months\r\nof arbitrary rule sufficed to disgust the most liberty-loving people in\r\nItaly, and the nobles and lesser guilds combined with the greater guilds\r\nto overthrow the despotism which had risen through the jealousy of\r\nclasses. Walter de Brienne ordered his hired horsemen to ‘course the\r\ncity,’ _i.e._ to gallop along the principal streets and disperse the\r\ninsurgents. But the citizens had erected barricades to bar the progress\r\nof the cavalry, and the duke, besieged in the Palazzo Vecchio, was\r\ncompelled to abdicate. His fall was followed by concessions to the\r\n_grandi_ who had taken an active part in the struggle. The Ordinances of\r\nJustice [Sidenote: Constitutional changes.] (_vide_ p. 32) were\r\nrepealed, and the office of gonfalonier, whose original function was to\r\nenforce the ordinances, was abolished. The government was to be\r\nintrusted to twelve priors, three from each quarter of the city; and of\r\nthese three, one was to be a noble and two burghers. Other offices were\r\nalso thrown open to the nobles. But the old jealousy of the _grandi_ was\r\ntoo deeply seated to allow this arrangement to be permanent. A rising of\r\nthe mob forced the four noble priors to quit the _palazzo_. The nobles\r\ntook up arms to defend their cause, but the civil strife was fatal to\r\nthe power of their whole class. The ordinances, and with them the office\r\nof gonfalonier, were revived, and the only permanent result of the\r\ncrisis was the extension of political privileges to the _popolo minuto_,\r\nor members of the lesser guilds. The number of priors was fixed at\r\neight, two from each quarter, and half the number were to belong to the\r\nlesser guilds. The gonfalonier was to be chosen alternately from the two\r\nclasses of citizens. But while the exclusion of the noble class from\r\noffice was rendered permanent, some five hundred members of that class\r\nwere freed from its disabilities by being disennobled and ‘raised’ to\r\nthe rank of ordinary burghers.\r\n\r\nThe martial spirit which enabled the Florentines to defeat the schemes\r\nof the Duke of Athens, was by no means common in Italy at the time, and\r\ndid not endure long even in Florence. The fourteenth century witnessed a\r\nchange in the military system of [Sidenote: Rise of Mercenaries in\r\nItaly.] Italy which was destined to exercise the most vital and lasting\r\neffects upon the history of the peninsula. In the twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies the military force of each state had consisted of the male\r\npopulation of the state organised as a militia. The central\r\nrallying-point of the army was the _carroccio_ or city standard, and the\r\nregiments were arranged according to local divisions, or sometimes\r\naccording to the guild organisation of the city. Such a force was the\r\nfirmest security for the maintenance of political liberty. But when\r\ndespots began to overthrow republican independence in most of the\r\ncommunes, their first aim was to disarm their subjects, and to procure\r\ntroops who had no natural sympathy with the native population. The\r\nexample was set by Frederick II., whose government of his southern\r\nkingdom furnished in many ways a model for the imitation of later\r\nrulers. In his struggle with the Popes he incurred great odium by taking\r\nSaracens into his pay. The northern despots tried to secure their power\r\nby enlisting foreign soldiers under their standard. Each of the\r\nsuccessive invasions of Henry VII., Lewis the Bavarian, and John of\r\nBohemia, left behind a number of German adventurers who were willing to\r\ntake Italian pay. These men were formed into body-guards by the Visconti\r\nand other Italian despots, who were thus enabled to disarm their\r\nsubjects, and to trample on their liberties. And the republics which\r\nretained their independence soon found it necessary to follow the\r\nexample of the princes. The mercenary troops were for the most part\r\nheavy-armed cavalry, and the civic infantry were no match for them in\r\nthe open field. The republics would only have courted destruction by\r\ncontinuing to employ a force which was inadequate for their defence.\r\nMoreover, under the altered conditions of warfare, campaigns were much\r\nlonger than when the struggle was decided by a single contest between\r\nthe armed populace of two rival cities. The ordinary citizen could no\r\nlonger afford to sacrifice his time and his business to do work which he\r\nmight pay others to do for him. It was cheaper to be heavily taxed for\r\nthe maintenance of a hired force, than to leave the shop or the\r\ncounting-house for a protracted campaign. The Florentines soon adopted\r\nthe custom of employing mercenaries, and in 1351 commuted personal\r\nservice for a money payment. The Venetians, though they employed native\r\ncrews and native commanders in their fleet, always hired foreigners to\r\nfight their battles on land. One result of the change was that infantry\r\nwas wholly superseded by heavy-armed cavalry, until the general use of\r\ngunpowder, and the intervention of the great powers in Italy, brought\r\nabout another great change in the art of war.\r\n\r\nAt first the mercenary troops in Italy were employed as the body-guard\r\nof a tyrant, or as the standing army of a republic. But as the leaders\r\nof these forces became conscious [Sidenote: Foreign Condottieri.] of\r\ntheir power, they began to form independent armies, which might live at\r\nthe expense of the unwarlike natives, or might acquire wealth by letting\r\nout their services to the highest bidder. The first notable instance of\r\nsuch an army was in 1343, when a German, Werner, or, as the Italians\r\ncalled him, Guarnieri, formed the Great Company. He levied contributions\r\non the states which he entered with his forces, and only occasionally\r\ntook part in the Italian wars. The same company, or another with the\r\nsame name, appears in 1353 under the command of Fra Moreale, who was\r\nafterwards put to death by Rienzi. When the treaty of Bretigny put an\r\nend for a time to the English wars in France, a new flood of foreign\r\nadventurers poured into Italy, where they formed the White Company under\r\nthe famous Englishman, John Hawkwood or Giovanni Acuto. He was\r\ndistinguished among _condottieri_ for the fidelity with which he\r\nperformed his contracts, and the Florentines expressed their sense of\r\nhis services by giving him a tomb and a monument in the _Duomo_.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier part of the fourteenth century the majority of the\r\nmercenary soldiers and their commanders were foreigners; in the later\r\npart of the century their place was to a large extent taken by native\r\ntroops and _condottieri_. As the smaller communes were gradually\r\ndeprived of liberty and of an independent political life by the\r\nextension of the larger states, the more energetic and [Sidenote: Native\r\nCondottieri.] ambitious citizens were only too glad to find an opening\r\nfor their activity in the career of arms. In 1379 the Company of St.\r\nGeorge, into which none but Italians were admitted, was founded by\r\nAlberigo da Barbiano, a noble of Romagna. In this company were trained\r\nBraccio and Sforza, the founders of the two great schools of Italian\r\ncommanders in the fifteenth century. That the native troops could be as\r\nefficient as the foreigners whom they superseded was proved in 1401,\r\nwhen a German army in the service of the Emperor Rupert was routed by an\r\nItalian force which had been hired by the Duke of Milan.\r\n\r\nWhatever semblance of unity had been given to Italian history by the\r\ncontinuance of party feuds disappeared altogether in the later part of\r\nthe fourteenth century, when party allegiance was finally subordinated\r\nto the desire of each state for territorial aggrandisement.\r\nChronological arrangement becomes impossible, and all that can be done\r\nis to briefly point out the most notable incidents in the history of the\r\ngreater states. It will be convenient to begin this survey with the\r\nsouth of the peninsula, and to proceed northwards.\r\n\r\nThe ambition of Robert of Naples had been moderated by the death of his\r\nonly son in 1328, and though he continued [Sidenote: Naples.] to support\r\nthe Popes in their quarrel with Lewis the Bavarian, he took very little\r\npart in Italian politics in his later years. The subsequent history of\r\nNaples turns for the most part upon dynastic rivalry, and demands an\r\naccurate knowledge of genealogy.[9] Robert himself had succeeded his\r\nfather in 1309 to the exclusion of the stronger hereditary claim of his\r\nnephew, Carobert of Hungary. Carobert died in 1342, leaving two sons,\r\nLewis, king of Hungary and afterwards of Poland, and Andrew. Robert, who\r\ndied in the following year, had no direct descendants except two\r\ngranddaughters, Joanna and Maria, the children of Charles of Calabria.\r\nIn the hope of averting strife with the Hungarian branch Robert, before\r\nhis death, arranged a marriage between Joanna and her cousin Andrew.\r\n[Sidenote: Joanna I. and Andrew.] But this expedient failed to produce\r\nthe desired result. Joanna claimed the right of succession to her\r\ngrandfather, and wished to treat her husband as a mere prince-consort.\r\nAndrew, however, insisted on the priority of his own claim as the male\r\nrepresentative of the eldest line. The quarrel was complicated by the\r\naction of two descendants of Robert’s younger brothers, Lewis of\r\nTaranto, who was suspected of being Joanna’s lover, and Charles of\r\nDurazzo, who had married Maria, the queen’s younger sister. Both were\r\naspirants for the succession, and while Lewis sided with Joanna, Charles\r\nencouraged the Hungarian prince to assert his claims. At last, in 1345,\r\nEurope was scandalised by the news that Andrew had been murdered.\r\nSuspicion rested from the first upon Joanna and Lewis of Taranto, whom\r\nshe subsequently married, though it is as difficult to furnish absolute\r\nproof of their guilt as in the superficially similar case of Mary Stuart\r\nand Bothwell. Lewis of Hungary, however, considered himself justified in\r\naccusing Joanna of his brother’s murder, and took measures to exact\r\nvengeance and, [Sidenote: Lewis of Hungary invades Naples.] at the same\r\ntime, to assert his own claim. His expedition was delayed for two years\r\nby the intrigues of Pope Clement VI., by the struggle in Germany between\r\nLewis the Bavarian and Charles IV., and by the opposition of the\r\nVenetians, always quarrelling with Hungary for the possession of\r\nDalmatia. It was not till the end of 1347 that Lewis was able to make\r\nhis way overland to Naples. Many of the nobles, including Charles of\r\nDurazzo, rallied to his cause, and Joanna was forced to fly to Provence.\r\nLewis was crowned king of Naples, and one of his first acts was to put\r\nto death Charles of Durazzo, nominally on a charge of complicity in\r\nAndrew’s death, but probably because he might prove a dangerous\r\ncandidate for the throne. The outbreak of the Black Death and\r\ndifficulties in Hungary compelled Lewis to return northwards, and Joanna\r\nseized the opportunity to attempt the recovery of her kingdom. To raise\r\nmoney she sold Avignon to Clement VI., and it remained a papal\r\npossession till its annexation to France in 1791. Joanna’s return to\r\nNaples was followed by a desultory war with the Hungarian party. Lewis\r\nreturned to uphold his cause in 1350, but he found it practically\r\nimpossible to hold a kingdom so distant from Hungary, and in 1351 he\r\nagreed to a treaty. The question of Joanna’s guilt was referred to the\r\nPope, and on his decision in her favour Lewis resigned the Neapolitan\r\ncrown, magnanimously refusing the money compensation which was offered\r\nhim by the papal award.\r\n\r\nFor the next thirty years the history of Naples was comparatively\r\nuneventful. Joanna married two more husbands [Sidenote: Succession to\r\nJoanna I.] after the death of Lewis of Taranto, but had no children to\r\nsurvive her. As she grew old the question of the succession became of\r\npressing importance. Her nearest relative was her niece, Margaret, the\r\ndaughter of her sister Maria and the Charles of Durazzo who had been put\r\nto death in 1348. The latter’s brother, Lewis, had left a son, another\r\nCharles of Durazzo, who, in 1370, married his cousin Margaret, and was\r\nafterwards treated by Joanna as her heir. But in 1378 the Great Schism\r\nin the Papacy began, and the queen and her nephew took opposite sides.\r\nJoanna was the first and most ardent supporter of Clement VII., whereas\r\nCharles of Durazzo, who had been trained and employed by his kinsman,\r\nLewis of Hungary, espoused the cause of Urban VI. The result was a\r\nviolent quarrel, and Urban encouraged Charles, in 1381, to take up arms\r\nagainst Joanna instead of waiting for the succession. Determined to\r\ndisinherit her undutiful kinsman, and, at the same time, to gain the\r\nsupport of France, Joanna offered to [Sidenote: The second House of\r\nAnjou.] adopt as her heir Louis of Anjou, brother of Charles V. of\r\nFrance. Louis could trace descent from the Neapolitan house, as his\r\ngreat-grandfather, Charles of Valois, had married a daughter of Charles\r\nII. of Naples. The offer was accepted, and from it arose the claim to\r\nNaples of the second house of Anjou—a claim which distracted southern\r\nItaly for a century, and ultimately passing to the French king, became\r\nthe pretext for the famous invasion of Charles VIII. in 1494. But for\r\nthe moment Joanna’s action brought her little good. Before aid could\r\ncome from France she was taken prisoner by Charles, and died in\r\ncaptivity (May 22, 1382). The successful [Sidenote: Charles III. and\r\nLouis I.] prince was crowned as Charles III. of Naples. His rival, Louis\r\nof Anjou, seized one of Joanna’s dominions, the county of Provence,\r\nwhich remained in the hands of his descendants. He also led a formidable\r\narmy to enforce his claim upon Naples, but he was not successful, and\r\ndied in 1385 without gaining more than the mere title of king.\r\n\r\nCharles III. was now firmly established in Naples, but the disturbances\r\nin Hungary after the death of Lewis the Great induced him to assert a\r\nclaim to that kingdom. A momentary success was followed by his\r\nassassination (February 24, 1386). Hungary fell into the hands of\r\nSigismund, and civil war broke out in Naples between the supporters of\r\nLadislas, [Sidenote: Ladislas and Louis II.] Charles III.’s son, and\r\nLouis II. of Anjou, who inherited the claims of his father. There is no\r\nneed to trace the details of the struggle, which after many fluctuations\r\nof success ended in the victory of Ladislas. For a few years in the next\r\ncentury Ladislas was one of the most influential and active princes of\r\nItaly. On his premature death in 1414, the crown of Naples passed to his\r\nsister Joanna II., in whom the direct line of the original Angevin house\r\nof Naples came to an end.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious, and perhaps impossible, to narrate in detail the\r\nhistory of the Papal States during the residence of [Sidenote: Rome and\r\nthe Papal States.] the Popes at Avignon and the subsequent schism. Under\r\nthe strongest of the preceding Popes, there had never been any organised\r\ncentral government in the territories which owned their sway. The Popes\r\nhad been the suzerains rather than the rulers of the States of the\r\nChurch. Every considerable city was either a republic with its own\r\nmunicipal government, or was subject to a despot who had succeeded in\r\nundermining the communal institutions. Even in Rome itself the bishop\r\ncould exercise little direct authority. Over and over again, the\r\nturbulence of the citizens had driven successive Popes to seek a refuge\r\nin some smaller town. In fact, the Romans might easily have shaken off\r\npapal rule altogether but for two considerations. The Popes drew so much\r\nwealth from Latin Christendom that they could afford to levy very light\r\ntaxes upon their immediate subjects. And the Romans gained enormous\r\nindirect profit from the crowds of pilgrims and wealthy suitors who were\r\nconstantly drawn to the papal court. It is true that this profit was\r\ndiverted to Avignon in the fourteenth century, but though this was a\r\ngreat grievance to the Romans, it was a reason for demanding the return\r\nof the Popes rather than for making the separation permanent. The\r\ngovernment of Rome was in theory republican, but nothing survived from\r\nthe ancient republic except its memory and its disorder. A Senate had\r\nbeen revived in the twelfth century only to prove a complete failure,\r\nand the name of Senator had come to be applied to a temporary\r\nmagistrate, who was sometimes elected by the citizens but more often\r\nnominated by the Pope. A central board of thirteen officers, one from\r\neach _rione_ or district of the city, was intrusted with the municipal\r\nadministration, but it had little real authority. Every other commune in\r\nItaly had found it necessary to restrict or abolish the privileges of\r\nthe feudal nobles. But in Rome the Colonnas, the Orsini, and other noble\r\nfamilies enjoyed the most lawless independence and treated the citizens\r\nwith the utmost contempt. The brawls of their retainers filled the\r\nstreets with disorder, and it was dangerous for the townspeople to\r\nresist any outrage either on person or on property. The Popes had rarely\r\nbeen successful in checking the lawlessness of the barons, and now that\r\nthe Pope was at a distance from Rome all restraint upon their licence\r\nseemed to be removed.\r\n\r\nIt was in these circumstances that a momentary revival of order and\r\nliberty was effected by the most extraordinary adventurer of an age that\r\nwas prolific in adventurers. [Sidenote: Rienzi.] Cola di Rienzi was born\r\nof humble parents, though he afterwards tried to gratify his own vanity\r\nand to gain the ear of Charles IV. by claiming to be the bastard son of\r\nHenry VII. A wrong which he could not venture to avenge excited his\r\nbitter hostility against the baronage, while the study of Livy and other\r\nclassical writers inspired him with regretful admiration for the glories\r\nof ancient Rome. He succeeded in attracting notice by his personal\r\nbeauty and by the rather turgid eloquence which was his chief talent. In\r\n1342 he took the most prominent part in an embassy from the citizens to\r\nClement VI., and though he failed to induce the Pope to return to Rome,\r\nwhich at that time he seems to have regarded as the panacea for the\r\nevils of the time, he gained sufficient favour at Avignon to be\r\nappointed papal notary. From this time he deliberately set himself to\r\nraise the people to open resistance against their oppressors, while he\r\ndisarmed the suspicions of the nobles by intentional buffoonery and\r\nextravagance of conduct. On May 20, 1347, the first blow was struck.\r\nRienzi with a chosen band of conspirators, and accompanied by the papal\r\nvicar, who had every interest in weakening the baronage, proceeded to\r\nthe Capitol, and, amidst the applause of the mob, promulgated the laws\r\nof the _buono stato_. He himself took the title [Sidenote: The ‘good\r\nestate.’] of Tribune in order to emphasise his championship of the lower\r\nclasses. The most important of his laws were for the maintenance of\r\norder. Private garrisons and fortified houses were forbidden. Each of\r\nthe thirteen districts was to maintain an armed force of a hundred\r\ninfantry and twenty-five horsemen. Every port was provided with a\r\ncruiser for the protection of merchandise, and the trade on the Tiber\r\nwas to be secured by a river police.\r\n\r\nThe nobles watched the progress of this astonishing revolution with\r\nimpotent surprise. Stefano Colonna, who was [Sidenote: Rienzi’s triumph\r\nand fall.] absent on the eventful day, expressed his scorn of the mob\r\nand their leader. But a popular attack on his palace convinced him of\r\nhis error, and forced him to fly from the city. Within fifteen days the\r\ntriumph of Rienzi seemed to be complete, when the proudest nobles of\r\nRome submitted and took an oath to support the new constitution. But the\r\nsuddenness of his success was enough to turn a head which was never of\r\nthe strongest. The Tribune began to dream of restoring to the Roman\r\nRepublic its old supremacy. And for a moment even this dream seemed\r\nhardly chimerical. Europe was really dazzled by the revival of its\r\nancient capital. Lewis of Hungary and Joanna of Naples submitted their\r\nquarrel to Rienzi’s arbitration. Thus encouraged, he set no bounds to\r\nhis ambition. He called upon the Pope and cardinals to return at once to\r\nRome. He summoned Lewis and Charles, the two claimants to the imperial\r\ndignity, to appear before his throne and submit to his tribunal. His\r\narrogance was shown in the pretentious titles which he assumed, and in\r\nthe gorgeous pomp with which he was accompanied on public and even on\r\nprivate occasions. On August 15, after bathing in the porphyry font in\r\nwhich the Emperor Constantine had been baptized, he was crowned with\r\nseven crowns representing the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost. His most\r\nloyal admirer prophesied disaster when the Tribune ventured on this\r\noccasion to blasphemously compare himself with Christ. And Rienzi’s\r\ngovernment deteriorated with his personal character. It had at first\r\nbeen liberal and just; it became arbitrary and even treacherous. His\r\npersonal timidity made him at once harsh and vacillating. The heads of\r\nthe great families, whom he had invited to a banquet, were seized and\r\ncondemned to death on a charge of conspiracy. But a sudden terror of the\r\npossible consequences of his action caused him to relent, and he\r\nreleased his victims just as they were preparing for execution. His\r\nleniency was as ill-timed as his previous severity. The nobles could no\r\nlonger trust him, and their fear was diminished by the weakness which\r\nthey despised while they profited by it. They retired from Rome and\r\nconcerted measures for the overthrow of their enemy. The first attack,\r\nwhich was led by Stefano Colonna, was repulsed almost by accident; but\r\nRienzi, who had shown more cowardice than generalship, disgusted his\r\nsupporters by his indecent exultation over the bodies of the slain. And\r\nthere was one fatal ambiguity in Rienzi’s position. He had begun by\r\nannouncing himself as the ally and champion of the Papacy, and Clement\r\nVI. had been willing enough to stand by and watch the destruction of the\r\nbaronage. But the growing independence and the arrogant pretensions of\r\nthe Tribune exasperated the Pope. A new legate was despatched to Italy\r\nto denounce and excommunicate Rienzi as a heretic. The latter had no\r\nlonger any support to lean upon. When a new attack was threatened, the\r\npeople sullenly refused to obey the call to arms. Rienzi had not\r\nsufficient courage to risk a final struggle. On December 15 he abdicated\r\nand retired in disguise from Rome. His rise to power, his dazzling\r\ntriumph, and his downfall were all comprised within the brief period of\r\nseven months.\r\n\r\nFor the next few years Rienzi disappeared from view. According to his\r\nown account he was concealed in a cave in the [Sidenote: Rienzi in\r\nexile.] Apennines, where he associated with some of the wilder members\r\nof the sect of the Fraticelli, and probably imbibed some of their\r\ntenets. Rome relapsed into anarchy, and men’s minds were distracted from\r\npolitics by the ravages of the Black Death. The great jubilee held in\r\nRome in 1350 became a kind of thanksgiving service of those whom the\r\nplague had spared. It is said that Rienzi himself visited the scene of\r\nhis exploits without detection among the crowds of pilgrims. But he was\r\ndestined to reappear in a more public and disastrous manner. In his\r\nsolitude his courage and his ambition revived, and he meditated new\r\nplans for restoring freedom to Rome and to Italy. The allegiance to the\r\nChurch, which he had professed in 1347, was weakened by the conduct of\r\nClement VI. and by the influence of the Fraticelli, and he resolved in\r\nthe future to ally himself with the secular rather than with the\r\necclesiastical power, with the Empire rather than with the Papacy. In\r\nAugust 1351 he appeared in disguise in Prague and demanded an audience\r\nof Charles IV. To him he proposed the far-reaching scheme which he had\r\nformed during his exile. The Pope and the whole body of clergy were to\r\nbe deprived of their temporal power; the petty tyrants of Italy were to\r\nbe driven out; and the emperor was to fix his residence in Rome as the\r\nsupreme ruler of Christendom. All this was to be accomplished by Rienzi\r\nhimself at his own cost and trouble. Charles IV. listened with some\r\ncuriosity to a man whose career had excited such universal interest, but\r\nhe was the last man to be carried away by such chimerical suggestions.\r\nThe introduction into the political proposals of some of the religious\r\nand communistic ideas of the Fraticelli gave the king a pretext for\r\ncommitting Rienzi to the Archbishop of Prague for correction and\r\ninstruction. The archbishop communicated with the Pope, and on the\r\ndemand of Clement VI. Charles agreed to hand Rienzi over to the papal\r\ncourt on condition that his life should be spared. In 1352 Rienzi was\r\nconveyed to Avignon and thrust into prison. He owed his life perhaps\r\nless to the king’s request than to the opportune death of Clement VI. in\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\nThe new Pope, Innocent VI., was more independent of French control than\r\nhis immediate predecessors. The French king was fully occupied with\r\ninternal disorders, and with the English war. Thus the Pope was able to\r\ngive more attention to Italian politics, which were sufficiently\r\npressing. The independence and anarchy of the Papal States constituted a\r\nserious problem, but the danger of their subjection to a foreign power\r\nwas still more serious. In 1350 the important city of Bologna had been\r\nseized by the Visconti of Milan, and the progress of this powerful\r\nfamily threatened to absorb the whole of the Romagna. Innocent\r\ndetermined to resist their encroachments, and at the same time to\r\nrestore the papal authority, and in 1353 he intrusted [Sidenote:\r\nAlbornoz in Italy.] this double task to Cardinal Albornoz. Albornoz,\r\nequally distinguished as a diplomatist and as a military commander,\r\nresolved to ally the cause of the Papacy with that of liberty. His\r\nprogramme was to overthrow the tyrants as the enemies both of the people\r\nand of the Popes, and to restore municipal self-government under papal\r\nprotection. His attention was first directed to the city of Rome, which,\r\nafter many vicissitudes since 1347, had fallen under the influence of a\r\ndemagogue named Baroncelli. Baroncelli had revived to some extent the\r\nschemes of Rienzi, but had declared openly against papal rule. To oppose\r\nthis new tribune, Albornoz conceived the project of using the influence\r\nof Rienzi, whose rule was now [Sidenote: Rienzi’s return and death,\r\n1354.] regretted by the populace that had previously deserted him. The\r\nPope was persuaded to release Rienzi from prison and to send him to\r\nRome, where the effect of his presence was almost magical. The Romans\r\nflocked to welcome their former liberator, and he was reinstalled in\r\npower with the title of Senator, conferred upon him by the Pope. But his\r\ncharacter was not improved by adversity, and his rule was more arbitrary\r\nand selfish than it had been before. The execution of the _condottiere_,\r\nFra Moreale, was an act of ingratitude as well as of treachery. Popular\r\nfavour was soon alienated from a ruler who could no longer command\r\neither affection or respect, and in a mob rising Rienzi was put to death\r\n(October 8, 1354). But his return had served the purpose of Albornoz.\r\nRome was preserved to the Papacy, and the cardinal [Sidenote: Recovery\r\nof the Papal States.] could proceed in safety with his task of subduing\r\nthe independent tyrants of Romagna. Central Italy had not yet witnessed\r\nthe general introduction of mercenaries, and the native populations\r\nstill fought their own battles. The policy of exciting revolts among the\r\nsubject citizens was completely successful, and by 1360 almost the whole\r\nof Romagna had submitted to the papal legate. His triumph was crowned in\r\nthis year, when, by skilful use of quarrels among the Visconti princes,\r\nhe succeeded in recovering Bologna.\r\n\r\nBut the successes of Albornoz appeared more like the conquests of a\r\nforeign power than the restoration of a legitimate authority. The long\r\nresidence in Avignon had alienated Italian sympathies from [Sidenote:\r\nReturn of the Popes to Rome.] the Papacy. The Visconti embarked in open\r\nwar with the Popes after the fall of Bologna, and they had many\r\nadvantages on their side. The ecclesiastical thunders which had\r\nfrightened Lewis the Bavarian into submission had no terrors for Italian\r\nprinces. When Bernabo Visconti received a bull of excommunication from\r\nthe Pope, he forced the legates to eat the parchment and the leaden\r\nseal. It was evident that nothing but a return to Italy could render\r\npermanent the restored secular authority of the Popes. Urban V., who\r\nsucceeded Innocent VI. in 1362, was induced by the arguments of Albornoz\r\nand the personal influence of Charles IV. to disregard the prejudices of\r\nthe cardinals, and in 1368 he entered Rome, where he was joined by the\r\nemperor. But Urban was soon discouraged by the death of Albornoz, and\r\nthe obvious weakness of imperial support. He had no natural interests in\r\nItaly, which was a foreign country to him, and he found Rome quite as\r\nuncomfortable a place of residence as it had been represented. In 1370\r\nhe embarked for Marseilles, and returned to Avignon. His departure had\r\nthe most disastrous results. Papal authority was repudiated by the\r\ncities of Romagna, and the Visconti hastened to take advantage of the\r\naltered conditions. Even Gregory XI., who had been chosen by the\r\ncardinals as the least likely candidate to quit Avignon, found it\r\nnecessary to follow his predecessor’s example and return to Italy. But\r\nhis experience in Rome convinced him that the enterprise was hopeless,\r\nand his departure was only prevented by his death (March, 1378). The\r\nchoice of an Italian, Urban VI., as his successor was a partial\r\nconcession to the violence [Sidenote: The Schism, 1378-1418.] of the\r\nRoman mob. On the first pretext the French cardinals deserted their\r\nnominee, and the election of a rival Pope, Clement VII., inaugurated the\r\nGreat Schism which lasted for forty years. During this period the\r\ntemporal authority of the Papacy was again annihilated, and it was not\r\ntill the Council of Constance had restored unity in 1418 that its\r\nrevival could once more be seriously undertaken.\r\n\r\nThe history of Florence in the fourteenth century is filled with a\r\ncontinuous struggle of classes and families for political [Sidenote:\r\nFlorence.] ascendency. Though the details of the struggle are\r\ncomplicated and wearisome, it is necessary to pay some attention to its\r\ngeneral character in order to understand the conditions under which the\r\nlater authority of the Medici grew up. The expulsion of the Duke of\r\nAthens had been followed by a settlement by which the _grandi_ were\r\nexcluded from political power, which was to be shared between the\r\nmembers of the greater and the lesser guilds. But as time went on, and\r\nthe memory of previous disasters was effaced, the _popolo grasso_ began\r\nto aim at the [Sidenote: Class jealousies.] recovery of their former\r\npreponderance in the city. To propose a direct change of the\r\nconstitution might provoke a rising of the artisans, so it was decided\r\nto obtain the desired end by indirect methods. A law of 1301, of which\r\nit was forbidden to propose the revocation under heavy penalties,\r\ndecreed that a Ghibelline, or any man suspected of not being a true\r\nGuelf, was to be incapable of holding office. For the carrying out of\r\nthis law there grew up the practice of _ammonizio_, which has been\r\ncalled the ostracism of Florence. If a charge of Ghibellinism were\r\nbrought against a man, and supported by six witnesses, who swore to\r\npublic report, the priors were bound to admonish the accused, and any\r\nperson thus admonished (_ammonito_) was excluded from office. His name\r\nwas not placed in the bags, or if it were already included, it was put\r\non one side when drawn out and another name drawn in its place. This\r\nparty device was now employed by the wealthy burghers to recover a\r\nmonopoly of power for their class. By systematically bringing a charge\r\nof Ghibellinism against the members of the lesser guilds who were likely\r\nto obtain office, their exclusion could be effected without any open\r\nassertion of disqualification. In carrying out this policy the\r\nplutocrats were aided by the organisation of the _parte Guelfa_ (_vide_\r\np. 35), which was the stronghold of oligarchical interests within the\r\nrepublic. The accusations were managed by the captains of the _parte_,\r\nand they could always find the necessary six witnesses. The pretext for\r\nso strict an enforcement of the law against Ghibellinism was found in\r\nthe two Italian visits of Charles IV. in 1353 and 1368, though the\r\nemperor did nothing whatever to excite the alarm of the Guelfs.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the wealthy burghers won their victory by the abuse of\r\nwhat should have been a legal proceeding, than they were divided by the\r\nfamily quarrel of the Albizzi and the Ricci. Both families belonged to\r\nthe _popolo grasso_, and [Sidenote: The Albizzi and Ricci.] their feud\r\nhad at first none of the political significance which came to be\r\nassociated with it. In fact, the Ricci were the first to urge the harsh\r\nenforcement of the anti-Ghibelline laws, hoping to discredit their\r\nopponents, who came originally from the Ghibelline town of Arezzo. But\r\nthe Albizzi succeeded in gaining the support of the _parte Guelfa_, and\r\nwere thus enabled to turn the tables on their rivals. The _ammonizio_\r\nwas as useful a weapon against the Ricci faction as against the _popolo\r\nminuto_. By 1374 the Albizzi and their supporters had got the government\r\ninto their hands. But the indiscreet violence of their proceedings\r\nprovoked serious opposition. The _ammoniti_, constantly increasing in\r\nnumber, became more and more formidable. The desire for office, such a\r\npassion among the Florentines, was not merely due to ordinary ambition,\r\nbut also to the fact that the taxes were assessed by the arbitrary will\r\nof the state officials. The dominant faction, however, failed to\r\nappreciate the dangers that confronted them, and in seven months of 1377\r\nmore than eighty persons were admonished. This recklessness brought\r\nabout their ruin. In May 1378, Salvestro de’ Medici, who belonged to the\r\nRicci party, was drawn as gonfalonier. The bags were so depleted that\r\nthe possibility of his selection was foreseen, but his attachment to\r\nGuelf principles was so well known that it was considered unsafe to\r\naccuse him. In his second month of office he proposed a law to lessen\r\nthe power of the _parte Guelfa_, and to facilitate the recovery of civic\r\nrights by the _ammoniti_. As the scheme met with opposition in the\r\ncouncil, one of Salvestro’s supporters, Benedetto Alberti, called the\r\npeople to arms, and the law was carried under the pressure of mob\r\nviolence. The result was an unforeseen revolution. The Ricci had been\r\ndriven by common grievances into an alliance with the lesser guilds, but\r\nthe [Sidenote: Rising of the Ciompi, 1378.] demand for redress was taken\r\nup by the _Ciompi_, the lowest class of all. They were influenced, not\r\nso much by the wish to obtain political power as by the desire to extort\r\nbetter terms from their employers. Their movement was half revolution\r\nand half strike. The rising of the mob, which speedily passed beyond the\r\ncontrol of those who had called in its aid, might have destroyed the\r\nfoundations of the state but for the action of a poor wool-comber,\r\nMichel Lando, who was raised to the office of gonfalonier by the\r\naccident of popular caprice. He succeeded in suppressing disorder, while\r\nhe satisfied the more rational demands of his own class. A number of new\r\nguilds were formed of artisans who had hitherto been unorganised. Of the\r\neight priors, three were to be taken from the _arti maggiori_, three\r\nfrom the _arti minori_, and two from the new guilds. After effecting\r\nthis settlement, Lando, with a modesty as rare as the untaught\r\nstatesmanship he had displayed, resigned his office. His retirement left\r\nthe chief power in the hands of the party which had started the\r\nmovement, but had been unable to control its course. Salvestro de’\r\nMedici had disappeared from public life. Though he was only a distant\r\nrelative of the later Medici, his career served to associate the family\r\nname with the popular cause, and to give them a cue for the policy they\r\nafterwards pursued. The leadership of his party fell into the hands of a\r\ntriumvirate, consisting of Benedetto Alberti, Tommaso Strozzi, and\r\nGiorgio Scali. Alberti was a fairly moderate politician, but his two\r\nassociates were ambitious demagogues, who imitated the abuses of the\r\nAlbizzi, and employed the _ammonizio_ to rid [Sidenote:\r\nCounter-revolution in 1382.] themselves of their personal enemies. The\r\ninevitable reaction set in in 1382. A hostile _signoria_ came into\r\noffice, and a servant of Giorgio Scali was arrested on a charge of\r\nbearing false witness. Strozzi fled from the city, but Scali, trusting\r\nin the favour of the mob, determined to resist. His attempt to rescue\r\nhis servant was a failure, and he himself was seized by the priors. The\r\npopulace would not rise on his behalf, and he was put to death. A\r\ncounter-revolution undid all the changes of 1378. A _balia_ constituted\r\nby a parliament abolished the new guilds, and decreed that the priors\r\nshould be chosen, four from the greater, and four from the lesser\r\nguilds. The gonfalonier was always to belong to the former, who thus\r\nsecured a majority in the signory. The Albizzi and other exiles were\r\nrecalled to the city.\r\n\r\nFor the next fifty years after 1382, Florence was ruled by an\r\never-narrowing oligarchy. First, the greater guilds [Sidenote:\r\nOligarchical rule in Florence.] recovered a practical monopoly of\r\noffice. Later, certain members of these guilds obtained such complete\r\nascendency that the government almost ceased to be a republic, and thus\r\nthe way was prepared for the absolutism of the Medici. In 1387 Benedetto\r\nAlberti, the most blameless of the leaders in 1378, was driven into\r\nexile. A new _squittinio_ filled the bags with the names of partisans of\r\nthe dominant faction. A separate bag was formed for the chief leaders of\r\nthe faction, and two priors were to be drawn from among them (_Priori\r\ndel Borsellino_). Six of the priors were to belong to the greater\r\nguilds, and only two to the lesser. In 1393 Maso Albizzi, the leader of\r\nthe oligarchy, held the office of gonfalonier, and further measures were\r\ntaken to strengthen its supremacy. If a gonfalonier were drawn who was\r\ndispleasing to the rulers, another was to be drawn in his place, though\r\nthe former was to remain one of the priors. Three priors instead of two\r\nwere to be taken from the _borsellino_, or special bag. The signory was\r\nallowed to raise troops, and to levy taxes for their payment, without\r\nhaving to obtain the consent of the councils. These measures provoked a\r\nrising among the artisans. The rioters repaired to the house of Vieri de\r\nMedici, and invited him to lead them against the Albizzi. Vieri, who was\r\na kinsman of Salvestro de’ Medici, refused the offer of the mob, and the\r\nmovement was suppressed. In 1397 another rebellion, in which two members\r\nof the Medici family were concerned, was also put down, and the rule of\r\nthe dominant oligarchy was more firmly established than ever.\r\n\r\nThe great characteristic of this period of oligarchical government is\r\nthe activity and aggressiveness of the republic [Sidenote: Growth of\r\nFlorentine dominions.] in its external relations. Before 1342 Florence\r\nhad acquired the rule of considerable territories beyond the limits of\r\nits own _contado_, but most of these dominions were lost in the\r\ndisturbances which accompanied the expulsion of the Duke of Athens. The\r\ngreat service which the oligarchy rendered to Florence was the recovery\r\nof its ascendency in northern Tuscany. Prato, Pistoia, Volterra, San\r\nMiniato, and several lesser towns were acquired between 1350 and 1368.\r\nIn 1387 the important town of Arezzo was sold to the Florentines by\r\nEnguerrand de Coucy, who had held it as the lieutenant of Louis of\r\nAnjou. For some years after this the growth of Florence was checked by a\r\ndesperate war against the encroachments of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, who\r\nthreatened to unite Tuscany and Lombardy under his rule. It was in this\r\nwar that Sir John Hawkwood commanded for Florence against the Milanese\r\n_condottiere_, Jacopo del Verme. After Hawkwood’s death in 1394, the\r\nrepublic was for a time in serious danger. To save their independence,\r\nthe Florentines took the unusual step of appealing for German\r\nassistance, and urged the Elector Palatine, Rupert, who had been elected\r\nking of the Romans in opposition to Wenzel of Bohemia, to make war\r\nagainst the lord of Milan. The defeat of the German army at the battle\r\nof Brescia left Florence in greater straits than ever, when the sudden\r\ndeath of Gian Galeazzo in 1402 not only saved the Florentines from\r\nMilanese aggression, but enabled them to resume their policy of\r\nexpansion. Within the next twenty years Pisa, Cortona, and Livorno had\r\nbeen added to the dominions of Florence.\r\n\r\nIn northern Italy the fourteenth century witnessed the final struggle\r\nbetween the two great maritime republics, [Sidenote: Venice and Genoa.]\r\nVenice and Genoa. Ever since the beginning of the Crusades they had been\r\nrivals for commercial and political ascendency in the Levant. At first\r\nthe advantage had been on the side of the Venetians, and the diversion\r\nof the Fourth Crusade in 1204 to attack the Eastern Empire had given\r\nthem a dominant position in the islands and coasts of the Ægean. But the\r\nGenoese had their revenge in 1261, when they aided to overthrow the\r\nLatin Empire, and to establish Michael Palæologus in Constantinople. As\r\na reward for their services they received the suburb of Pera with the\r\nfortress of Galata, whence they could dictate to the occupants of the\r\nimperial throne. The control of the straits enabled them to assume a\r\nvirtual monopoly of the trade of the Black Sea, and their port of Caffa\r\nin the Crimea became one of the most flourishing cities in the east.\r\nPisa, which had once been the equal or even the superior of Genoa, lost\r\nall maritime importance after the battle of Meloria (1284). For the next\r\ncentury Venice and Genoa contended on fairly equal terms. In wealth and\r\nmaritime power they were evenly matched. Genoa had most of the northern\r\ntrade that passed through the Black Sea and Constantinople; but Venice,\r\nwhich retained possession of Negropont, Crete, and other islands, had\r\nthe advantage in the other two channels of eastern trade, through Asia\r\nMinor and Egypt. Genoa, however, was ready to seize any opportunity of\r\ncontesting this southern trade with her rival. The occupation of Chios\r\ngave her a valuable port in the Ægean. Cyprus, which became an important\r\ncommercial centre after the fall of Acre (1291), was the scene of many\r\nconflicts between the two republics. The people and the ruling house of\r\nLusignan were in favour of Venice, but the Genoese went to war to secure\r\ntheir interests, and the seizure of Famagusta in 1373 gave them for some\r\ntime the upper hand in Cyprus. On the African coast they also succeeded\r\nin establishing trade settlements. Farther west, the Genoese had several\r\nthings in their favour. The occupation of Corsica gave them a great\r\naddition of maritime strength, though their dispute with Aragon for the\r\npossession of Sardinia exposed them to the enmity of the Catalans, who\r\nranked after Venice and Genoa as the third naval power in the\r\nMediterranean. On the mainland the mountains which confined Genoa to a\r\nnarrow strip of coast, and prohibited territorial expansion, served also\r\nto protect her from continental enemies. Venice, on the other hand, ever\r\nsince the war with Mastino della Scala had given her territories on the\r\nmainland, was exposed to the hostility of her neighbours, especially the\r\nkings of Hungary and the lords of Padua. If these states were allied\r\nwith Genoa, Venice ran the risk of being cut off from supplies both by\r\nsea and land. As against this balance of strength in east and west,\r\nthere was one important difference between the two states which\r\nultimately turned the scales decisively in favour of Venice. By the\r\nbeginning of the century she had built up a constitution which, whatever\r\nits narrowness and other defects, had the supreme merit of stability.\r\nThe so-called conspiracy of Marin Falier, which led to the execution of\r\nthe Doge in 1355, only served to prove the strength of the edifice which\r\nhe proposed to attack, and the impotence of the chief magistrate to\r\nresist the Council of Ten. Genoa, on the other hand, was one of the most\r\nturbulent and factious of Italian cities. For a long time the leaders of\r\nthese domestic feuds were the four noble houses of Doria, Fieschi,\r\nSpinola, and Grimaldi, who disguised their family jealousies under the\r\nnames of Ghibelline and Guelf. In 1339 the Genoese, weary of their\r\nfactions, adopted for their chief magistracy the title of Doge, and\r\nconferred it by acclamation upon an eminent citizen, Simone Boccanegra.\r\nAfter the fashion of Florence and other Tuscan communes, the nobles were\r\ndisqualified from holding political office. But in Genoa the remedy\r\nproved wholly illusory. The nobles continued to command the military and\r\nnaval forces of the republic, and were thus enabled to retain their\r\npredominance in the state. The offices, which they could not hold\r\nthemselves, were conferred upon their plebeian adherents, as the Adorni\r\nand Fregosi, who for a long time succeeded each other in the dogeship\r\naccording to the fluctuations of power among their noble patrons. As\r\nCommines tells us, ‘the nobles in Genoa could appoint a doge, though\r\nthey could not hold the office themselves.’ Thus Genoa continued to be\r\ndistracted by factions, and when the citizens sought a brief interval of\r\nrepose, the only method by which they could secure it was to sacrifice\r\ntheir liberty to a foreign ruler—sometimes to Milan, and sometimes to\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe attempt of the Genoese merchants at Caffa to exclude the Venetians\r\nfrom the lucrative free trade with the Tartars led to numerous quarrels\r\nin the Black Sea, and [Sidenote: War of Venice and Genoa, 1350-5.]\r\nultimately to open warfare between the two states. Venice secured the\r\nsupport of John Cantacuzene, the Greek emperor, who disliked Genoese\r\ndictation at Pera, and of Peter of Aragon, who was contending with Genoa\r\nfor the possession of Sardinia. In 1352 Niccolo Pisani, with a powerful\r\nfleet of Venetian, Greek, and Catalan vessels, sailed to attack Pera,\r\nwhich was defended by the Genoese admiral, Paganino Doria. In the narrow\r\nwaters of the Bosphorus the allies were unable to make full use of their\r\nnumbers, and a furious storm threw their vessels into such disorder that\r\nthey did more harm to each other than to the enemy. Pisani was forced to\r\nretire, but Doria, though victorious, had suffered such losses that he\r\nwas superseded by Antonio Grimaldi. In 1353 the Aragonese, who had fewer\r\ninterests in the Levant than their allies, insisted upon transferring\r\nhostilities to the coast of Sardinia. In the open water off Cagliari the\r\nVenetians and Catalans gained a complete victory, and Grimaldi with\r\ndifficulty escaped to carry the news of this crushing disaster to Genoa.\r\nPisani was too weakened by the encounter to venture a direct attack upon\r\nGenoa, but the Genoese were so panic-stricken that they offered the\r\nlordship of the city to Giovanni Visconti, in order to gain the aid of\r\nMilan. Venice replied to this move by an alliance with the opponents of\r\nMilan on the mainland, but the struggle continued to be fought out at\r\nsea. Paganino Doria, restored to the command after Grimaldi’s defeat,\r\nonce more carried the war into eastern waters. Pisani, after an\r\nuneventful campaign in 1354, had retired into winter quarters at\r\nPortolungo on the coast of the Morea, under the shelter of the island of\r\nSapienza. There the Venetians were surprised by Doria, and their fleet\r\nwas completely annihilated (November 4, 1354). The battle of Sapienza\r\nwas the most decisive engagement of the struggle. It was followed by the\r\nconspiracy and death of Marin Falier, and the Venetians were so\r\ndiscouraged by the combination of external defeat and domestic treason\r\nthat they concluded peace with Genoa in 1355. All demands for\r\nconcessions in the Black Sea were abandoned, and Genoa retained its\r\nsuperiority in the northern trade.\r\n\r\nFor the next twenty years the two republics remained at peace with each\r\nother. Genoa succeeded in throwing off the Milanese yoke in 1356, with\r\nthe result that the factions resumed their quarrels. Venice became\r\ninvolved in a war with Lewis the Great of Hungary (1356-8), in which\r\nDalmatia was lost and Treviso was only retained with difficulty. This\r\nwas followed by a revolt in Crete which was put down (1364), and by\r\nalmost continuous quarrels with Francesco Carrara of Padua. These events\r\nforced the Venetians to maintain a policy of peace in the east. Even the\r\nwar of 1373 in Cyprus, which subjected that island to the suzerainty of\r\nGenoa, failed to provoke more than a verbal protest from Venice. But\r\nevents in the Eastern Empire at last drove the two republics to resume\r\nhostilities. John Palæologus had promised to Venice the rocky island of\r\nTenedos, which commanded the entrance to the Hellespont. The Genoese,\r\nregarding this as threatening their security in Pera, organised a palace\r\nrevolution in Constantinople, and seated Andronicus on the throne in\r\nplace of his father. In return for this aid the usurper ceded Tenedos to\r\nhis allies. But the governor of the island refused to recognise the\r\nauthority of Andronicus, and handed his charge over to the Venetians.\r\nThis was the immediate occasion for war. Vettor Pisani, in 1378,\r\ndefeated the Genoese fleet off Cape Antium, and cleared the Adriatic of\r\n[Sidenote: War of Chioggia, 1378-81.] the pirates who plundered Venetian\r\ncommerce. The winter he spent in the harbour of Pola, and was still\r\nthere when he was confronted by Luciano Doria in command of another\r\nGenoese force (May 7, 1379). In the battle which followed Pisani was\r\ncompletely defeated, and was sentenced by the indignant Venetians to six\r\nmonths’ imprisonment and exclusion from any command for five years.\r\nPietro Doria, the successor of Luciano who had been killed in the\r\nengagement, led the victorious fleet to the lagoons of Venice. The town\r\nof Chioggia, which commanded one of the main entrances from the open\r\nsea, was taken after an obstinate defence, and the way was opened to\r\nVenice itself. A prompt attack would probably have been successful, but\r\nDoria preferred the slower and surer method of a blockade. In this he\r\nreckoned upon the aid of Francesco Carrara, who eagerly welcomed the\r\nopportunity of humbling the formidable republic, and undertook to\r\nprevent the transit of supplies from the mainland. Never had the\r\nVenetians been in such a strait, but the courage of the citizens rose to\r\nmeet the danger. Every vessel in Venetian waters was equipped and\r\nmanned, and Vettor Pisani, the idol of the sailors, was released from\r\nprison to assume the chief command. Messengers were sent eastwards to\r\nrecall Carlo Zeno, who had been despatched to the Levant at the\r\nbeginning of the war with the second Venetian fleet. Meanwhile Pisani\r\nundertook the defence of Venice, and gradually drove the Genoese back to\r\ntheir stronghold of Chioggia. There he determined to shut them in by\r\nblocking the main outlets to the sea. Ships full of stones were sunk in\r\nthe channels of Brondolo, Chioggia, and Malamocco, and thus the\r\nblockaders were in their turn blockaded. But Pisani’s force was hardly\r\nstrong enough to maintain the blockade during the storms of winter. If\r\nreinforcements came from Genoa he would be forced to retire, and Venice\r\nwould once more be in imminent danger. So conscious were the Venetian\r\nleaders of the risk of ultimate defeat that they even discussed the\r\npossible abandonment of their islands and the transference of the\r\nrepublic to Crete. On the 1st of January 1380 sails were seen in the\r\ndistance, but as they approached they proved to be the long-expected\r\nfleet of Zeno. This sealed the fate of the Genoese in Chioggia. Every\r\neffort to force a passage, or to cut a canal through the low-lying\r\nbarrier between them and the sea, was foiled by the vigilance of the\r\nbesiegers, and on June 24 the whole of the Genoese force was compelled\r\nto capitulate.\r\n\r\nBy the fall of Chioggia Venice secured a magnificent and permanent\r\ntriumph over her great Italian rival. The naval [Sidenote: Decline of\r\nGenoa.] power of Genoa never recovered from the blow which it then\r\nreceived, and commercial superiority could only be maintained by\r\nmaritime ascendency. Chagrined at such a sudden change from anticipated\r\ntriumph to humiliating defeat, distracted by domestic feuds, and\r\nperpetually endangered by the aggressive policy of Milan, the Genoese\r\nsought to escape from their troubles by accepting the suzerainty of\r\nCharles VI. of France, and admitting a French governor into the city\r\n(1396). For the next century Genoa enters into history mainly as an\r\nobject of contention between France and Milan, and the greatness of the\r\nrepublic perished with its independence.\r\n\r\nBut Venice had to pay more than one heavy penalty for her success. In\r\nthe east the war of the two republics had been [Sidenote: Venice after\r\nthe War.] suicidal. In their mutual jealousy they had completely lost\r\nsight of their common interest in upholding the Eastern Empire against\r\nthe Turks. The struggle between Venice and Genoa was among the chief\r\ncauses of the rapid growth of the Ottoman power, which was destined to\r\nbe fatal to both the contending states. The more Venice gained in the\r\neast by the decline of Genoa the more she stood to lose to the advancing\r\nTurks; and nearer home the struggle was costly to Venice. By the peace\r\nof Turin, in 1381, she had to confirm the cession of Dalmatia to\r\nHungary, to resign the island of Tenedos, which had been the occasion of\r\nthe war, and to give up Treviso and all other possessions on the\r\nmainland of Italy. All that she had gained in the contest with the\r\nScaligers was lost again. It is true that Treviso was ceded to Leopold\r\nof Hapsburg in order to disappoint Francesco Carrara, whose\r\naggrandisement would be much more dangerous to Venice. But Leopold had\r\ntoo much to engage his attention in Germany to be keenly interested in\r\nItalian territories. Five years later he sold Treviso, with Feltre and\r\nCeneda, to Carrara, who thus obtained that control over the approaches\r\nto the Alpine passes which had driven Venice to make war on Mastino\r\ndella Scala. For the second time Venice was forced by the same danger to\r\ntake an active part in the politics of northern Italy. There was one\r\nobvious method of humbling the house of Carrara, and that was to invite\r\nthe intervention of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, who required the annexation\r\nof Padua to complete his supremacy in Lombardy. On the other hand, such\r\na policy involved the equally obvious danger that the lord of Milan\r\nwould prove a far more formidable neighbour than the lord of Padua. To\r\nunderstand the course of action adopted by Venice in this dilemma it is\r\nnecessary to turn to the history of Milan.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the fourteenth century the lordship of Milan was\r\ndisputed by two families, the della Torre and the [Sidenote: The\r\nVisconti in Milan.] Visconti. The supremacy of the latter was\r\nestablished in 1312 when Henry VII. conferred the title of imperial\r\nvicar upon Matteo Visconti. Of Matteo’s numerous family four sons\r\ndeserve mention: Galeazzo, Lucchino, and Giovanni, who all ruled in\r\nMilan, and Stefano, who died in 1327 without obtaining power, but whose\r\nchildren subsequently came to govern. Galeazzo, the eldest son, who\r\nsucceeded his father in 1322, was deposed by Lewis the Bavarian in 1327,\r\nand died in the following year at the siege of Pistoia. His son Azzo\r\nrecovered, in 1329, the sovereignty of Milan, and the tide of imperial\r\nvicar. He proved a successful ruler, and by joining in the successive\r\nleagues against John of Bohemia and Mastino della Scala, he extended his\r\nauthority over the greater part of central Lombardy. On his early death\r\nin 1339 his uncle Lucchino succeeded to the lordship over Milan,\r\nBergamo, Brescia, Cremona, Lodi, Piacenza, Vercelli, Novara, and a less\r\ncomplete sovereignty over Pavia. To these dominions Lucchino added Parma\r\nin 1346, and Tortona, Alessandria, and Asti in 1347. On the west these\r\nterritories were bounded by the dominions of the Marquis of Montferrat\r\nand the Count of Savoy; while on the east they were separated from\r\nVenice and the States of the Church by the possessions of four tyrants\r\nof lesser power—the Gonzagas in Mantua, the house of Este in Ferrara,\r\nthe della Scala in Verona and Vicenza, and the Carrara in Padua. On the\r\ndeath of Lucchino in 1349 his dominions passed to his younger brother\r\nGiovanni, who had entered the Church, and had received from Benedict\r\nXII. the archbishopric of Milan. In spite of his ecclesiastical position\r\nGiovanni did not scruple to aggrandise himself at the expense of the\r\nPapacy. In 1350 he induced the Pepoli, who had made themselves lords of\r\nBologna, to cede that city to him. This advance from Lombardy into\r\ncentral Italy made a profound impression on contemporaries, and\r\ncompletely altered the position of the Visconti. It marked the beginning\r\nof a prolonged quarrel with the Papacy, and it alarmed Florence and the\r\nTuscan communes for their independence. In 1353 the defeat of Genoa in\r\nher naval war with Venice led to the temporary submission of the\r\nLigurian republic to Milanese rule. This was the last great triumph of\r\nthe militant archbishop, who died suddenly in 1354.\r\n\r\nThe house of Visconti was now represented by the three sons of Stefano:\r\nMatteo, Bernabo, and Galeazzo. They agreed to divide their uncle’s\r\ndominions between them, but to keep the two chief cities of Milan and\r\nGenoa under their joint rule. Matteo, who was vicious and debauched even\r\n[Sidenote: Bernabo and Galeazzo Visconti.] beyond the standard of the\r\nVisconti, was assassinated by order of his brothers in 1355, and Bernabo\r\nand Galeazzo divided his share between them. On the whole their joint\r\nrule was wonderfully harmonious, though in later life they fell rather\r\napart and adopted different residences—Bernabo in Milan and Galeazzo in\r\nPavia. Few pictures are more repulsive than that which has been handed\r\ndown of the domestic government of the two brothers. In the midst of\r\nlavish profusion and ostentatious patronage of men of letters, they\r\nruled their subjects with a rod of iron. State criminals, instead of\r\nimmediate execution, were publicly tortured for forty days according to\r\na fixed daily programme. The game laws were enforced with atrocious\r\nseverity even for those days. A peasant who had killed a hare was given\r\nto Bernabo’s hounds to be devoured by them. Yet these bloodthirsty\r\ndespots, belonging to an upstart family and without any recognised or\r\nlegal title in their dominions, were allowed to ally themselves by\r\nintermarriage with the greatest dynasties in Europe. They were the\r\nrichest rulers of their time, and their wealth induced even kings to\r\nshut their eyes both to the cruelty of their rule and to their ignoble\r\norigin. Bernabo married his daughter Verde or Virida to the Leopold of\r\nHapsburg who afterwards fell in the battle of Sempach. Galeazzo obtained\r\nfor his son, Gian Galeazzo, the hand of Isabella, daughter of John of\r\nFrance, with the county of Vertus in Champagne; and his daughter\r\nViolante was married to Lionel of Clarence, the second son of Edward\r\nIII. of England.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these alliances, which gave to the Visconti a unique\r\nposition among the despots of northern Italy, the [Sidenote: Milanese\r\nreverses.] rule of the two brothers was by no means uninterruptedly\r\nsuccessful. Genoa revolted in 1356 and recovered its freedom. Cardinal\r\nAlbornoz, who was engaged in restoring papal authority in the Papal\r\nStates, organised a league among the northern despots, the Gonzagas, the\r\ndella Scala, the Marquis of Montferrat, and all who were jealous of\r\nVisconti ascendency. Pavia recovered its independence for two years\r\nunder the encouragement of a republican monk, Jacopo Bussolari, but was\r\ncompelled to surrender to Galeazzo in 1359. Asti, Novara, Como, and\r\nother western towns were for a time wrested from Visconti rule by the\r\nMarquis of Montferrat. A more serious loss was that of Bologna. Giovanni\r\nd’Oleggio, who had been appointed governor of the city by Giovanni\r\nVisconti, refused to acknowledge the authority of the latter’s nephews.\r\nWhen Bernabo endeavoured to compel his submission in 1360, Oleggio\r\nbaulked him by surrendering Bologna to Albornoz. The successes of the\r\npapal legate and the return of Urban V. to Rome seemed for a moment to\r\nrender hopeless any extension of the rule of the Visconti beyond the\r\nlimits of Lombardy. But Albornoz died in 1368, Urban returned to Avignon\r\nin 1370, and a general revolt in Romagna against papal rule restored to\r\nthe Visconti the advantages which for a moment they had lost. It was\r\nnot, however, Bernabo Visconti who profited by these changes, but a new\r\nand more famous member of the family.\r\n\r\nIn 1378—an eventful year in Italian history—Galeazzo Visconti died,\r\nleaving his share of the family dominions to his only son, Gian\r\nGaleazzo. Fearing the ambition [Sidenote: Gian Galeazzo Visconti.] of\r\nBernabo, who might well desire to provide for his numerous children at\r\nhis nephew’s expense, the young prince ruled in Pavia with such\r\nostentation of piety and moderation that his uncle deemed him a harmless\r\nsimpleton. Having thus disarmed all suspicion, Gian Galeazzo decoyed his\r\nuncle from Milan to a friendly interview, consigned him to a prison\r\nwhich he never left alive, and reunited the territories of Bernabo with\r\nhis own (1385). To the cruelty and unscrupulousness of his predecessors,\r\nGian Galeazzo added a dogged resolution and a capacity for intrigue\r\nwhich enabled him to attain a height of power beyond their most sanguine\r\ndreams. Personally he was so timid that a sudden sound excited a terror\r\nwhich he could not conceal. But his lack of courage—an unusual defect\r\namong Italian tyrants—proved no bar to his ambition. His wealth enabled\r\nhim to attract to his service most of the ablest _condottieri_ of the\r\nage, and to purchase from them a fidelity which was quite uncommon.\r\nHimself the husband of a French princess, he drew closer the connection\r\nwith France by marrying his daughter, Valentina, to Charles VI.’s\r\nbrother, Louis of Orleans (1389). The bride not only brought to the\r\nOrleans family the town of Asti as her dowry, but also an eventual claim\r\nto the succession in Milan which was fraught with most momentous\r\nconsequences to Europe. A few years later Gian Galeazzo succeeded in\r\nremoving one great defect in the dignity of the Visconti by obtaining\r\nfrom Wenzel, king of the Romans, the formal creation in his favour of a\r\nhereditary duchy of Milan (1395).\r\n\r\nThe great ambition of Gian Galeazzo Visconti was to found a kingdom of\r\nnorthern Italy, and circumstances were [Sidenote: His schemes.] so\r\nextraordinarily favourable that he very nearly succeeded in gaining his\r\nobject. The two great Guelf powers, Naples and the Papacy, might\r\nnaturally be expected to oppose such a design. But the Papacy was in the\r\nthroes of the Schism, and Naples was the scene of civil strife between\r\nthe two houses of Anjou. Of the three leading republics whose\r\nindependence was directly threatened, Genoa was powerless. Florence was\r\nhampered by the jealousy of Siena, Perugia, and other communes in\r\nTuscany and Romagna, while Venice had for the moment more immediate\r\nenemies than Milan, and might be bribed to aid in their destruction. The\r\nempire was in the feeble hands of Wenzel, France in the equally feeble\r\nhands of Charles VI., and both princes were allied with the Visconti.\r\nThere seemed to be hardly any danger either of foreign intervention or\r\nof efficient resistance in Italy.\r\n\r\nThe first task which Gian Galeazzo undertook was the reduction of\r\neastern Lombardy. A quarrel between Francesco Carrara and Antonio della\r\nScala gave him his opportunity. [Sidenote: Conquest of Verona and\r\nPadua.] He offered his aid to both princes, but ultimately concluded a\r\ntreaty with Carrara in 1387 by which Verona was to go to himself and\r\nVicenza to Padua. Both cities were easily taken by Gian Galeazzo’s\r\ntroops, and the once famous house of della Scala was ruined. But the\r\nlord of Milan kept Vicenza as well as Verona, and Carrara perceived too\r\nlate that he had only hastened his own downfall. Venice was eager to\r\npunish the neighbour who had done all he could for her destruction in\r\nthe wars both with Hungary and with Genoa. In spite of the obvious\r\ndanger of aggrandising Milan, Venice agreed to a partition of the\r\nterritories of Carrara. Resistance to such a combination was hopeless;\r\nPadua was compelled to surrender to Milanese rule, and Treviso and the\r\nmarches were handed over to Venice (1388). The supremacy of Gian\r\nGaleazzo in Lombardy was now uncontested. The remaining princes of\r\nSavoy, Montferrat, Mantua, and Ferrara, were all, for one reason or\r\nanother, his humble vassals.\r\n\r\nIn 1389 Gian Galeazzo was free to turn his attention to Tuscany and\r\nRomagna, where his ambition seemed to be equally favoured by internal\r\ndissensions. Siena, Perugia, and a number of petty lords in Romagna\r\n[Sidenote: War with Florence, 1390-2.] joined in a league against\r\nFlorence, whose fall would have assured the supremacy of Milan. But the\r\nFlorentine oligarchy served the republic faithfully in this hour of\r\ndanger. Sir John Hawkwood was taken into the service of Florence, and\r\nthe Count of Armagnac was bribed to bring a body of French troops to aid\r\nthe republic. Visconti had engaged the most eminent Italian leaders,\r\nJacopo dal Verme, Facino Cane, and others, and the numerical superiority\r\nof their troops might have gained an ultimate victory. Armagnac was\r\ndefeated and slain, and this disaster compelled Hawkwood, who had\r\ninvaded Lombardy as far as the Adda, to conduct a difficult and\r\nhazardous retreat. But the balance was turned against Milan by a wholly\r\nunexpected reverse in the north. The younger Francesco Carrara, who had\r\nbeen imprisoned with his father after the fall of Padua, succeeded in\r\nescaping. After hairbreadth escapes and the most romantic wanderings\r\nover Europe, he succeeded in getting supplies of money from Florence and\r\nof men from Bavaria. With a small body of followers he entered Padua by\r\nthe bed of the Brenta in June 1390. The citizens welcomed his return,\r\nand the rule of Milan was overthrown. This revolution in Padua was a\r\ngreat blow to Gian Galeazzo. It compelled him to withdraw part of his\r\nforces from Tuscany, and in 1392 he decided to postpone his southern\r\nenterprise and to conclude a treaty. Padua was left in the hands of\r\nFrancesco Carrara on condition of paying tribute to Milan; Florence was\r\nto abstain from intervention in Lombardy, and Gian Galeazzo from\r\nintervention in Tuscany.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of 1392 was followed by a few years of troubled peace, broken\r\nby only a brief renewal of hostilities in 1397, which was ended by\r\nanother treaty in 1398. During these years Gian Galeazzo continued to\r\nprosecute his schemes by diplomacy and intrigue. [Sidenote: Successes of\r\nGian Galeazzo.] In 1394 a revolution was effected in Pisa and the\r\nlordship of the city acquired by Jacopo d’Appiano, who was notoriously\r\nin the pay of Milan. Five years later, Appiano’s son completed the\r\nbargain by handing over Pisa to Gian Galeazzo in return for the\r\nprincipality of Piombino. Genoa only escaped a similar fate by a\r\nvoluntary submission to France in 1396. Siena in 1399, Perugia and\r\nAssisi in 1400 sought to escape the disorders of faction by accepting\r\nthe rule of Milan. Everywhere republican liberties seemed destined to\r\ngive way to the advance of despotism. Paolo Guinigi, with the help of\r\nMilanese gold, made himself lord of Lucca in 1400, and in the next year\r\nGiovanni Bentivoglio became the master of Bologna. Slowly but surely the\r\ncoils were being drawn round Florence, and the league which she had\r\nformed for the defence of liberty was wholly broken up. Hawkwood had\r\ndied in 1394, and no leader of equal merit could be found except in the\r\nservice of Milan. A momentary prospect of relief was offered when the\r\nprinces of Germany in 1400 deposed the incapable Wenzel and gave the\r\nkingship of the Romans to the Elector Palatine, Rupert III. Rupert\r\nundertook to invade Italy and to crush the upstart ruler of Milan whom\r\nhis rival had raised to the rank of duke. But the German troops were no\r\nmatch either in skill or in discipline for the mercenaries of Italy, and\r\nwere utterly routed at Brescia by Jacopo dal Verme (October 24, 1401).\r\nThe last hope of Florence disappeared when Giovanni Bentivoglio, who had\r\nturned against Milan, was compelled to surrender, and the Bolognese\r\nwelcomed the substitution of a foreign for a native despot (July, 1402).\r\nBut death intervened to thwart an [Sidenote: His death in 1402.]\r\nambition which human opposition had failed to check. On September 3,\r\n1402, Gian Galeazzo was carried off by the plague at the age of\r\nfifty-five. The kingdom of northern Italy perished with the man who had\r\npractically created it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  See Genealogical Table I, in Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n            THE SCHISMS IN THE PAPACY AND EMPIRE, 1378-1414\r\n\r\n\r\n    Decline of German Monarchy—Dangers to Germany—Policy of Charles\r\n    IV.—Return of the Papacy to Rome and election of Urban\r\n    VI.—Election of Clement VII. and beginning of the Schism—The\r\n    German towns and their hostility to the nobles—Weakness of\r\n    Wenzel—The town-war—Peace of Eger—The Succession to Hungary and\r\n    Poland—The Jagellon House is established in Poland, and\r\n    Sigismund in Hungary—Opposition to Wenzel in Germany—Troubles in\r\n    Bohemia—France and the Schism—Meeting of Wenzel and Charles\r\n    VI.—A Schism is created in the Empire—The idea of a General\r\n    Council—Negotiations between the rival Popes—Europe and the\r\n    Schism—The Council of Pisa—The Triple Schism—Alexander V. and\r\n    his successor John XXIII.—Death of Rupert of the Pale—Election\r\n    of Sigismund—Jobst—Death of Jobst—Second election of\r\n    Sigismund—Sigismund and Pope John XXIII.—Summons of the Council\r\n    of Constance.\r\n\r\nWith the year 1378 begins a period of anarchy and confusion\r\ncharacteristic of the decay of an old organisation, and the inevitable\r\nprecursor of a new system. In that year died Gregory XI. and Charles\r\nIV., the representatives of secular and ecclesiastical authority as\r\nconceived in the Middle Ages. Of the two claimants to universal rule,\r\nthe Papacy and the Empire, the former was immeasurably the stronger. It\r\npossessed a large revenue and an admirable administrative system. The\r\nEmpire had neither. Its claims to rule over Christendom were no longer\r\nacknowledged. Even in Italy its suzerainty was recognised as a legal\r\nform, but in actual politics little regard was paid to it. And the\r\nGerman monarchy had fallen with the grandiose and unreal dignity to\r\nwhich it was attached. The imperial domains had been seized or\r\nsquandered. The central administration and jurisdiction were hardly\r\nexistent. Such authority as the king [Sidenote: Decline of German\r\nmonarchy.] possessed rested upon the territorial powers which he held\r\nindependently of his kingship. His nominal vassals—ecclesiastics, lay\r\nprinces, knights and cities—enjoyed practical independence. If they\r\nquarrelled with each other, they fought the quarrel out as if they had\r\nbeen independent states. If the Emperor intervened, it was as a partisan\r\nrather than as an arbiter. There was no parliamentary organisation, as\r\nin England, where the interests of the various estates could find\r\neffective expression. There was no overwhelming national sentiment, such\r\nas was created by the Hundred Years’ War in France, to enable the\r\nmonarchy to gain ascendency and to crush rival pretensions.\r\n\r\nThe dangers of this growing disunion were sufficiently obvious in the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries. It seemed [Sidenote: Dangers to\r\nGermany.] almost inevitable that Germany would lose all semblance of a\r\nstate, and that as it fell to pieces foreign powers would seize upon the\r\nfragments. In the south-east the Turks were gradually establishing\r\nthemselves on the ruins of the Byzantine Empire, and threatened to\r\nadvance up the valley of the Danube into the heart of southern Germany.\r\nFurther north a powerful Slav kingdom was erected in Poland under the\r\nHouse of Jagellon, whose mission seemed to be to annihilate the progress\r\nwhich German influences had effected by means of the Teutonic knights.\r\nThe Slav kingdom of Bohemia, which under the House of Luxemburg had\r\nbecome almost the capital of Germany, revolted against the rule and the\r\nreligion of its kings, and the Hussite victories revealed more clearly\r\nthan any other single event the rottenness and impotence of the existing\r\nsystem in Germany. In the north, the Union of Kalmar brought the three\r\nScandinavian states under a single ruler, and threatened to deprive the\r\nGerman Hansa of the ascendency in northern waters which Lübeck and its\r\nassociates had gained by their victory over Waldemar III. of Denmark. In\r\nthe south, the Swiss Confederation was tending to free itself from even\r\nnominal dependence on the Empire, and there were other leagues in Swabia\r\nand on the Rhine which were not unlikely to follow its example. In the\r\nwest, German weakness had already allowed France to swallow a great part\r\nof the old kingdom of Arles, and though France was for a time crippled\r\nby the war with England and by internal dissensions, a new and more\r\npressing danger was created by the rapid growth of the Valois dukes of\r\nBurgundy, who absorbed one imperial fief after another, and at one time\r\nalmost succeeded in building up a middle kingdom along the Rhine, which\r\nwould have excluded Germany from all real influence on the development\r\nof western Europe.\r\n\r\nCharles IV., the greatest ruler of the fourteenth century, had clearly\r\ngrasped both the dangers of the situation and [Sidenote: Policy of\r\nCharles IV.] the only remedies which could be applied. Either Germany\r\nmust be organised as a federation which should combine some measure of\r\nlocal independence with joint action for common interests, or a single\r\nfamily must collect such an aggregate of territories in its hands as\r\nmight become the nucleus of a new territorial monarchy. Charles had kept\r\nboth expedients before him. He had laid the foundations of a federal\r\norganisation by conferring corporate powers and privileges upon the\r\nelectors. At the same time he had made the Luxemburg family the\r\nstrongest in Germany, and had placed it in a position to do for Germany\r\nwhat the Capets had done for France. It is a common error to maintain\r\nthat Charles IV.’s policy was a complete failure; that what he meant to\r\nbe a temporary expedient proved permanent, while his ultimate aims were\r\nnever achieved. It is true that a territorial monarchy was not\r\nestablished, and that such unity as Germany has since possessed has been\r\nfederal rather than monarchical. But what really held Germany together\r\nfrom the fifteenth to the eighteenth century was not the federal system,\r\nbut the territorial power of the house of Hapsburg. And that territorial\r\npower was, in the main, founded by Charles _IV._ It is as the heirs of\r\nthe Luxemburg family that the Hapsburgs assumed their unique position in\r\nGermany. Charles IV. achieved more lasting results than he has been\r\ncredited with, but the fruits of his policy were gathered by others than\r\nhis own descendants.\r\n\r\nOne very obvious source of weakness to Charles IV. had been his failure\r\nto control the ecclesiastical system, owing to the residence of the\r\nPopes at Avignon. [Sidenote: Return of the Papacy to Rome.] Charles\r\nhimself had gained the German monarchy to some extent as the papal\r\nnominee; but he had found it necessary to resist papal intervention in\r\nGermany as long as that intervention was dictated by a foreign power. It\r\nwas obviously Charles’s duty and interest to restore the Papacy to Rome,\r\nwhere alone it could exercise impartial authority. He had induced Urban\r\nV. to transfer his residence to Rome, but his hopes had been\r\ndisappointed by the Pope’s speedy return to the banks of the Rhône. Once\r\nagain his influence had been successful, and in 1377 Gregory XI. had\r\nleft Avignon for the Eternal City. But both Pope and cardinals found\r\nRome too turbulent to be an agreeable abode, and they were preparing for\r\nanother flitting when the death of Gregory compelled the conclave to\r\nmeet for a new election within the Vatican. The mob surrounded the\r\npalace and demanded the choice of a Roman Pope. The majority of the\r\ncardinals were Frenchmen, but they were divided among themselves, and\r\nthey were afraid of the violence of the citizens. As a compromise, they\r\nchose a Neapolitan, the archbishop of Bari, [Sidenote: Election of Urban\r\nVI., 1378.] who took the name of Urban VI. So little confidence had the\r\ncardinals that their decision would please the people, that they escaped\r\nin disguise and left the news of the election to become known gradually.\r\nThis fact is sufficient to prove that the election was not altogether\r\ncompulsory, and as soon as the mob had shown itself acquiescent, the\r\ncardinals were unanimous in acknowledging Urban.\r\n\r\nBut this unanimity was very short-lived. Urban VI. had never been a\r\ncardinal, and was personally unknown to most of his electors. He proved\r\nto be a man of violent temper and rough manners, eager to exercise his\r\nunexpected authority, and reckless of opposition or advice. The\r\ncardinals, who had hoped for a pliant and grateful tool, found\r\nthemselves confronted with a master who announced that he would begin\r\nthe reform of the Church with its chief dignitaries. He silenced\r\nremonstrances by the rudest sarcasms, and declared that he would never\r\nreturn to Avignon. Disappointed and indignant, many of the cardinals\r\nquitted Rome for Anagni. Encouraged by the support of France and Naples,\r\nthey declared that Urban’s election was invalid on account of the\r\nintimidation of the mob, and on September 20, 1378, proceeded to elect\r\nRobert of Geneva, a militant ecclesiastic who had succeeded Cardinal\r\nAlbornoz as commander [Sidenote: Election of Clement VII.] of the papal\r\ntroops in Italy. The Antipope assumed the name of Clement VII., and his\r\nelection commenced a schism in the Church which lasted for forty years.\r\n\r\nCharles IV. had watched these events in Italy with the greatest chagrin.\r\nHe gave unhesitating support to Urban VI., and urged the European\r\nprinces to resist the revival of French dictation in the Church. But his\r\ndeath on November 29 removed the one statesman who might possibly have\r\nchecked the progress of the schism. His son and successor, Wenzel,\r\npursued his father’s policy, but he was too young, and, as it proved,\r\ntoo incapable, to exercise the same influence. He threatened Joanna I.\r\nof Naples with the imperial ban if she did not give up the cause of\r\nClement; and this threat was the more formidable because the Neapolitans\r\nthemselves favoured their fellow-countryman Urban. But the only result\r\nwas to aggravate the schism. Finding that residence on Neapolitan soil\r\nwas no longer safe, Clement VII. and his [Sidenote: The schism in the\r\nChurch, 1378-1417.] cardinals left Italy for Avignon. There Clement was\r\nsecure of French support, and before long he was also recognised by the\r\nSpanish kingdoms, Castile, Aragon, and Navarre. Germany, England, and\r\nmost of the northern kingdoms gave their allegiance to Urban VI., and\r\nafter his death to his successors, Boniface IX. (1389-1404), Innocent\r\nVII. (1404-5), and Gregory XII., elected in 1405. Clement VII. lived\r\ntill 1394, when he was succeeded by a Spaniard, Peter de Luna, who took\r\nthe name of Benedict XIII.\r\n\r\nThe schism in the Church was by no means the only difficulty which\r\nWenzel had to face. In Germany, as in [Sidenote: The German towns.]\r\nother countries, the feudal system, in which social and political\r\nrelations depended upon the tenure of land, had been modified by the\r\ngrowth of towns, whose interests lay in industry rather than in\r\nagriculture, while their desire to maintain peace conflicted with the\r\nmilitary habits and traditions of the noble landholders. In England and\r\nin France the monarchy had advanced its own interests by taking the\r\nrising towns under its patronage and by aiding the growth of municipal\r\nself-government. At one time, under Lewis the Bavarian, a similar policy\r\nhad seemed possible in Germany. At the diet of Frankfort in 1344 the\r\nspeaker of the town deputies had used the memorable words: _civitates\r\nnon possunt stare nisi cum imperio: imperii lesio earum est destructio_.\r\nBut Charles IV., guided by his experiences in Italy, had distrusted the\r\ntowns: he had suspected them of aiming at independence rather than the\r\nstrengthening of the monarchy: and in the Golden Bull he had\r\ndeliberately opposed the development of the towns while he had conceded\r\ngreat powers to the electors. But his policy in this respect had not\r\nbeen altogether successful even during his own lifetime. The Hanse towns\r\nin the north had risen to the zenith of their power in 1370, and Charles\r\nhad found it politic to conciliate them by a personal visit to Lübeck.\r\nIn the south the Swabian League had been formed under the leadership of\r\nUlm, had defeated the warlike Count of Würtemburg, and had compelled the\r\nold emperor to allow them the right of union, of which they had been\r\ndeprived by the Golden Bull.\r\n\r\nThe death of Charles IV. and the accession of the feeble and\r\nself-indulgent Wenzel enabled the towns to take bolder measures. In 1381\r\nan alliance was concluded at [Sidenote: Hostility of towns and nobles.]\r\nSpeier between the Swabian League and the towns on the Rhine; and its\r\nobject was not merely mutual defence, but ‘to scourge and punish their\r\nmutual enemies.’ The league thus formed contained seventy-two towns, and\r\ncould supply a military force of ten thousand men-at-arms. And this\r\nforce was by no means their only or their most effective weapon. By\r\ngranting a modified form of citizenship (_Pfahlbürgerthum_), they\r\nannexed whole villages in their neighbourhood, thus depriving the lords\r\nat once of subjects, revenue, and territory. If the landholder tried to\r\nrecover his loss, he only devastated his own property, while the\r\noffending citizens were safe within walls that until the general use of\r\ngunpowder were almost impregnable. It was no wonder that the princes\r\nresented the growth of a power which seemed likely to rival their own.\r\nBut the class which was most immediately threatened by the towns was\r\nthat of the knights or lesser tenants-in-chief. Their chief occupations\r\nwere warfare and pillage, and the towns were resolute in putting a stop\r\nto practices which ruined their trade. Single-handed the knights were\r\npowerless against the civic forces, and they were driven to form\r\nleagues, such as the famous League of the Lion, for their own defence.\r\nThere was little love lost between the knights and the princes, but\r\nclass prejudices and associations tended to draw them together against a\r\nfoe whom they both detested and contemned. The materials were prepared\r\nfor a great war of classes in Germany.\r\n\r\nWenzel had neither the ability nor the experience to enable him to deal\r\nsuccessfully with such a problem, and his attention was also occupied by\r\nfamily affairs in the east and by the quarrel in the Church. His only\r\nexpedient was to form associations for the maintenance of the peace in\r\nwhich both princes and cities should be included. By this means he\r\nsucceeded in postponing but not in preventing a war. The quarrel of\r\nLeopold of Hapsburg with the Swiss precipitated matters. The Swiss\r\nconfederation differed from the Swabian and Rhenish leagues in that it\r\nincluded village communities of peasants as well as towns. When in 1385\r\nan alliance with the Swabian League was proposed, the original forest\r\ncantons refused to take any part in the matter, and only the towns,\r\nBern, Zürich, Zug and Luzern were parties to the compact. The battle of\r\nSempach was won mainly by the peasants, and the Swabian towns sent no\r\nassistance. But the fall of Leopold of Hapsburg, the champion of\r\nprincely interests, was hailed as a triumph by the towns, and had the\r\nnatural effect of increasing their pride and pretensions. In 1387 the\r\nwar which had been on the verge of outbreak since 1379 at last began.\r\nThere was little that was notable in the actual hostilities, except\r\ntheir extent. The [Sidenote: The town war, 1387-9.] war was merely a\r\nsimultaneous explosion of the numerous feuds which had often been waged\r\nbefore between a noble and a too powerful town. As long as the citizens\r\nstood on the defensive, they were successful, and the armies of the\r\nprinces and knights were repulsed from their walls. Emboldened by these\r\nsuccesses, they determined to leave their walls and to invade the\r\nterritories of their old enemy, Eberhard of Würtemburg. But the German\r\ntowns had no such soldiers as the peasants of the Alps, and no such\r\ngeographical advantages as the Swiss had. In the open field their forces\r\nwere cut to pieces by the feudal cavalry. On August 24, 1388, the united\r\ntroops of the Swabian League suffered a severe defeat at Döffingen. The\r\nweakness of their position was now apparent. They could resist\r\naggression, but they could not themselves take the offensive. The\r\nRhenish towns were defeated with great loss at Worms, and Nürnberg, the\r\nlatest and the most important recruit of the Swabian League, was reduced\r\nto submission by the Burggraf.\r\n\r\nBut the triumph of the nobles was incomplete. Though they had been\r\nvictorious in the field, they were as unable as before to carry on siege\r\noperations. Their defensive strength enabled the towns to negotiate the\r\npeace of Eger (1389) [Sidenote: Peace of Eger, 1389.] on fairly equal\r\nterms. By this treaty all leagues and unions were to be abrogated on\r\nboth sides. All future disputes between the towns and the nobles were to\r\nbe settled by arbitration. For this purpose four commissioners were\r\nappointed in Swabia, Franconia, Bavaria, and the Rhenish provinces. Each\r\ncommission was to consist of four nobles, four citizens, and a president\r\nto be appointed by the Emperor. It is obvious that the towns, though\r\ndefeated, had not been wholly unsuccessful, and had secured a position\r\nof equality with their opponents. But the real importance of the war is\r\nthe discredit which it cast upon the monarchy. Wenzel had been unable\r\neither to prevent the war or to influence its course. And the\r\norganisation created for the maintenance of the peace was a local and\r\nrepresentative organisation, in which the central authority had little\r\nmore than a nominal share.\r\n\r\nWhile Germany was convulsed with the town war, the House of Luxemburg\r\nhad made an important territorial acquisition in the east. Lewis the\r\nGreat, king of Hungary and Poland, the head of the original House of\r\nAnjou in Naples, had died in 1380. He left a widow, Elizabeth, and two\r\ndaughters, Maria and Hedwig. In spite [Sidenote: Succession in Hungary\r\nand Poland.] of the natural prejudices against female rule, he had\r\ninduced his subjects to recognise his daughters’ claim to the\r\nsuccession. If they were passed over, the nearest male heir was Charles\r\nof Durazzo,[10] who was engaged in a struggle for the crown of Naples\r\nwith Louis of Anjou, brother of Charles V. of France. Maria, the elder\r\nof the two daughters, was betrothed to Sigismund, the second son of\r\nCharles IV. She was accepted by the Hungarians, and Sigismund was eager\r\nthat his future wife should also gain the crown of Poland. But the\r\nPoles, influenced by the growing Slav sentiment, were unwilling to\r\ncontinue the connection with Hungary or to accept a German ruler. They\r\ninsisted upon electing the younger sister Hedwig, and upon choosing a\r\nhusband for her. Hedwig was sent to Poland in 1385, and in the next year\r\nwas married to Jagello, prince of Lithuania, who was baptized as a\r\nChristian under the name of Ladislas. The union of Poland and Lithuania\r\nunder the Jagellon house founded a powerful Slav state to the north-east\r\nof Germany, and led to the downfall of the Teutonic Knights, who could\r\nno longer claim to conduct a crusade when their foes had accepted\r\nChristianity (see p. 459).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sigismund, disappointed in Poland, came near to losing Hungary\r\nas well. Elizabeth, the late king’s widow, [Sidenote: Sigismund’s\r\naccession in Hungary, 1387.] unwilling to surrender authority to an\r\nambitious son-in-law, tried to break off Maria’s engagement, and to\r\nbring about a marriage with a French prince. But her schemes were\r\nsuddenly checkmated by a revolt of the Hungarian nobles, who offered the\r\ncrown to Charles of Durazzo, now established on the throne of Naples.\r\nCharles accepted the offer, and landed in Dalmatia in 1385. This\r\nunexpected danger forced Elizabeth to appeal for assistance to\r\nSigismund, whose long-delayed marriage was hastily solemnised in October\r\n1385. The bridegroom hurried off to raise troops for the defence of his\r\nwife’s crown, and among his expedients for gaining money he pawned a\r\ngreat part of Brandenburg to his cousin Jobst of Moravia. Meanwhile\r\nevents in Hungary moved with kaleidoscopic rapidity. Charles of Naples,\r\nafter having apparently secured his kingdom, was assassinated by the\r\nemissaries of Elizabeth in February 1386. Elizabeth recovered authority\r\nin her daughter’s name, and at once quarrelled with her son-in-law,\r\nwhose assistance seemed to be no longer needed. But the nobles of\r\nCroatia determined to avenge the death of Charles. They seized Elizabeth\r\nand Maria, and carried them off to the fortress of Novigrad. When the\r\nfortress was besieged, the former was put to death, and Maria was\r\nthreatened with the same fate. In the general anarchy, the Hungarian\r\nnobles determined to offer the crown to Sigismund, who was crowned in\r\n1387, and soon afterwards succeeded in effecting his wife’s release. His\r\naccession added a new province to the Luxemburg possessions, and at the\r\nsame time founded the dynastic connection between Hungary and Bohemia\r\nwhich still exists.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of Hungary did nothing to strengthen the position of the\r\nHouse of Luxemburg in Germany, while it increased the jealousy with\r\nwhich its overgrown territories were regarded. The western princes,\r\nrepresenting the original German duchies of Bavaria, Franconia, and\r\nSwabia, resented the transference of power to a dynasty whose\r\npossessions lay mostly in the east, and some of them outside Germany\r\naltogether. The House of Wittelsbach, from whose hands Charles IV. had\r\nsnatched the imperial dignity, were the foremost in raising this outcry\r\nof the west against the east. And the malcontents were not [Sidenote:\r\nOpposition to Wenzel in Germany.] without more serious grounds of\r\ncomplaint. Wenzel had done nothing to terminate the ecclesiastical\r\nschism. His feeble and vacillating conduct during the town war had\r\ndisgusted the princes; and after the peace of Eger he had practically\r\nwithdrawn from German politics, and had left the kingdom in a state of\r\nanarchy. Even in the east he incurred difficulties and humiliations\r\nwhich brought discredit upon his person and his office.\r\n\r\nCharles IV. had had two sources of strength which his successor entirely\r\nlacked. He could rely upon the enthusiastic loyalty of the Bohemians,\r\nand he was the undisputed head of the Luxemburg family. Neither of his\r\nbrothers had ever ventured to oppose his will. But under Wenzel Bohemia\r\nenjoyed neither the prestige nor [Sidenote: Troubles in Bohemia.] the\r\ngood government which had endeared Charles to his subjects, while there\r\nwas a growing feeling that it was degrading to a Slav people to be ruled\r\nby a German prince and by German methods. The sentiment of race which\r\nhad led Poland to unite with Lithuania under Jagello was beginning to be\r\npowerful in Bohemia, in spite of its long and intimate association with\r\nGermany. Wenzel himself was not personally unpopular. The very\r\ncoarseness of his character and manners, which degenerated in time into\r\nbrutish gluttony and drunkenness, seems to have evoked a rude sympathy,\r\nat any rate among the lower classes. But his reckless passion led him\r\ninto gross political blunders, his unconcealed contempt alienated the\r\nclergy, while his patronage of unworthy favourites exasperated the\r\nnobles. A series of disorderly revolts began in 1387, and followed each\r\nother in rapid succession. And Wenzel’s kinsmen, instead of assisting\r\nthe head of their house, rather added to his embarrassments. The evil\r\ngenius of the family was his cousin, Jobst of Moravia, a man who\r\nanticipated the Italians of the next century in his selfish cunning and\r\nhis complete disregard of moral rules. Jobst had already gained\r\nBrandenburg by trading on the pecuniary difficulties of Sigismund, and\r\nhe hoped by discrediting Wenzel to obtain for himself the Bohemian and\r\nthe imperial crowns. In 1394 he was at the head of a baronial revolt, in\r\nwhich Wenzel was seized and imprisoned by the rebels. The most loyal\r\nmember of the family, John of Görlitz, who succeeded in releasing his\r\nbrother, was treated by Wenzel with gross ingratitude, and died in 1396,\r\nnot without grave suspicions of poison. Sigismund, though absorbed in\r\nthe pursuit of his own ends, was less cynically selfish than Jobst, and\r\nshowed some regard for the dignity and interests of his house. But he\r\nwas prevented from giving Wenzel any real assistance or guidance by the\r\nnecessity of defending his own kingdom of Hungary against the Turks. In\r\n1396 he led a large crusading army to be cut to pieces by the forces of\r\nBajazet I. on the field of Nicopolis. But for the advance of the Tartars\r\nunder Timour, eastern Europe would have been at the mercy of the\r\nvictorious sultan.\r\n\r\nThe scandals in Bohemia and the quarrels among the Luxemburg princes\r\nseem to have convinced the western princes that Wenzel was as little to\r\nbe feared as respected. He had given them a new grievance in 1395 by\r\ngranting the title of Duke of Milan and thus raising to princely rank\r\nthe aggressive Ghibelline leader in northern Italy, Gian Galeazzo\r\nVisconti. And three years later he gave them a pretext for throwing off\r\ntheir allegiance by his action with regard to the [Sidenote: France and\r\nthe schism.] schism in the Church. From the first the University of\r\nParis, then by far the most influential university in Europe, had set\r\nitself against a schism which the French government had done much to\r\nbring about. At first the king had silenced the university, but\r\ngradually he had come to share its views. France found it extremely\r\nexpensive to support a schismatic Pope who had little but French\r\ncontributions to look to for the maintenance of himself and his court.\r\nPopular sympathy was cooled when a Spaniard, Peter de Luna, was chosen\r\nto succeed the French Pope Clement VII. Under the guidance of the\r\nuniversity leaders, Pierre d’Ailly and Jean Gerson, Charles VI. and his\r\nministers determined to end the schism by ‘the way of neutrality,’\r\n_i.e._ by withdrawing allegiance from the two rival Popes, and thus\r\nforcing them to abdicate, when a new election could restore unity to\r\nChristendom. To give effect to this scheme, it was necessary to secure\r\nsimultaneous action on the part of the supporters of the Roman Pope\r\nBoniface IX., and of these the most exalted was the King of the Romans.\r\nWenzel seems to have inherited some of the traditional attachment to\r\nFrance of the Luxemburg [Sidenote: Meeting of Wenzel and Charles VI.]\r\ndynasty, and he had quarrelled with Boniface about the appointment of an\r\nArchbishop of Mainz. The two kings, the one a confirmed drunkard and the\r\nother subject to fits of insanity, met at Rheims in 1398 to discuss the\r\nmost pressing problem of the age. Their personal intercourse cannot have\r\nbeen very edifying. On one occasion Wenzel was invited to a banquet with\r\nthe French king, and when the Dukes of Burgundy and Berri came to escort\r\nthe guest, they found that he had already dined, and was lying under the\r\ntable in a drunken sleep. But the interview resulted in a more or less\r\nformal agreement that France should extort the resignation of Benedict,\r\nwhile Wenzel was to do the same by Boniface.\r\n\r\nThe Elector Palatine had already warned Wenzel that if he withdrew his\r\nallegiance from the Pope who had confirmed his title, his subjects would\r\nno longer be bound [Sidenote: Schism in the Empire, 1400.] to him. The\r\ninterview at Rheims had the effect of hurrying the execution of a plan\r\nwhich had been for some time in contemplation. Boniface IX., though\r\ncareful to avoid committing himself to the conspiring princes, was not\r\nunwilling to checkmate Wenzel by encouraging his opponents in Germany.\r\nOf the seven electors, two, representing Bohemia and Brandenburg,\r\nbelonged to the Luxemburg house, while the Duke of Saxony held aloof.\r\nThe other four, whose territories bordered on the Rhine, met in 1400 at\r\nLahnstein, decreed the deposition of Wenzel, and elected one of their\r\nown number, the Count Palatine, Rupert III. But the Rhenish electors,\r\nlike the recalcitrant cardinals in 1378, had no power to enforce their\r\ndecree of deposition, and the only result of their action was to create\r\na schism in the Empire side by side with the schism in the Church.\r\n\r\nRupert was a far wiser ruler and a far better man than his rival, and if\r\nto his other virtues he had added the slightest military capacity, he\r\nmight have gained a complete triumph. Wenzel continued to quarrel with\r\n[Sidenote: The rival Kings of the Romans.] his brother and his cousins,\r\nand during a revolt in Hungary Sigismund was for five months a prisoner\r\nin the hands of his barons. If Ladislas of Naples had not been occupied\r\nin his contest with Louis II. of Anjou, he might have enforced the\r\nclaims of the House of Durazzo to the Hungarian crown, as his father had\r\ndone in 1385. But the difficulties of the Luxemburg princes were not\r\nenough to enable Rupert to profit by them. He invaded Bohemia, and\r\nactually reached Prague, where Jobst and the malcontent nobles offered\r\nhim their support. But at the first slight reverse he withdrew, and his\r\nopportunity was lost when Sigismund escaped from captivity and came to\r\ngovern Bohemia for his incompetent brother. Then Rupert tried to obtain\r\nan indirect triumph by crushing Wenzel’s _protégé_, Gian Galeazzo\r\nVisconti. He hoped thus to restore German influence in Italy, which the\r\ntwo last Luxemburg rulers had allowed to decay, and also to receive the\r\nimperial crown from the gratitude of Boniface IX. Florence and all the\r\nopponents of the Milanese despot promised to aid him with men and money.\r\nBut his Italian expedition was even more unsuccessful than his invasion\r\nof Bohemia. His army was utterly routed by the mercenary forces of Gian\r\nGaleazzo under the walls of Brescia (October 21, 1401), and he returned\r\nto Germany the laughing-stock of Europe. His failure encouraged Wenzel\r\nto plan a journey to Italy to obtain his long-delayed coronation, and\r\nSigismund undertook to escort him. Boniface IX., who was now committed\r\nto the cause of Rupert, sought to foil the scheme by urging Ladislas of\r\nNaples to an invasion of Hungary, which proved unsuccessful. But the\r\nproject was perforce abandoned on the news of the death of Gian Galeazzo\r\n(September 3, 1402). From this time the rival Kings of the Romans\r\nabstained from direct attacks on each other, and contented themselves\r\nwith their respective obedience, the one in the west and the other in\r\nthe east. Germany was so accustomed to dispense with any active exercise\r\nof the royal authority that the schism created little excitement and\r\nless inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe schism in the Church was far more important to Europe, though the\r\nchief actors were hardly more imposing than the rival emperors. The\r\nposition of the Papacy was necessarily shaken by the contentions of two\r\nold men, each claiming to exercise divine authority, and each cursing\r\nthe other with human petulance. The religious were shocked by such a\r\nspectacle: the irreligious laughed and mocked. A contemporary remarks\r\nthat for a long time Christians had had an earthly god who forgave their\r\nsins, but now they have two such gods, and if one will not forgive their\r\nsins, they go to the other. The prolonged scandal forced men to change\r\ntheir conception of papal power, and to contend that such power does not\r\nexist for its own ends, but for the sake of the whole Church. If\r\ntherefore that power is grossly abused, it is the right and even the\r\nduty of the Church to interfere on behalf of its suffering [Sidenote:\r\nThe idea of a General Council.] members. Hence arose the conciliar idea,\r\nwhich dominates all other ecclesiastical conceptions in the first half\r\nof the fifteenth century. The Church, as represented by a General\r\nCouncil, is superior to the head, as the whole body is superior to any\r\nmember. This idea found its main support in the Universities, especially\r\nin Paris, Oxford, and Prague. The schism in the Empire and the\r\nprominence of the University of Paris enabled France to take the\r\nforemost place in urging the summons of a Council to put an end to\r\necclesiastical anarchy. France had already adopted a policy of\r\nneutrality in 1398, and had gone so far as to besiege Avignon and to\r\nmake Benedict XIII. a prisoner. But a reaction had set in when no other\r\npower followed the example of France, and the Orleanist party, in\r\nopposition to the Duke of Burgundy, had espoused the cause of Benedict.\r\nIn 1402, to the great chagrin of the University of Paris, France\r\nreturned to its allegiance, and Benedict, released from his captivity,\r\njourneyed to the coast of Provence and opened negotiations with his\r\nrival in Rome. The last two Roman Popes, Innocent VII. and Gregory XII.,\r\nhad only been elected on the express condition that they would resign as\r\nsoon as their opponent did the same. Gregory XII. went so far as to make\r\nan agreement [Sidenote: Negotiations between the two Popes.] with\r\nBenedict, by which the two Popes pledged themselves to create no new\r\ncardinals, and to meet together at Savona in 1407. The agreement was\r\nprobably insincere on Gregory’s part, and at any rate there were\r\npowerful influences at work to prevent its execution. Gregory XII. might\r\nbe old and unambitious, but his relatives were eager to profit by his\r\nelevation, and he was too feeble to disregard their wishes. And Ladislas\r\nof Naples, who had become almost supreme at Rome under Innocent VII.,\r\nhad his own interest in prolonging the schism. A Roman Pope with a rival\r\nat Avignon was bound to support him against the Angevin claimant to\r\nNaples: but a new Pope, chosen at Savona under French influence, would\r\nbe sure to espouse the cause of Louis of Anjou. None of the princes of\r\nEurope wished France to recover the ascendency in Church matters which\r\nit had enjoyed from 1305 to 1378, yet this would probably be the result\r\nif France were allowed to take the lead in terminating the schism. So\r\nthe negotiations between the two Popes remained ludicrously futile.\r\nGregory came as far north as Lucca, and Benedict as far south as\r\nSpezzia, yet they could not agree to meet. ‘The one,’ said Leonardo\r\nBruni, ‘like a land animal, refused to approach the sea; the other, like\r\na water-beast, refused to leave the shore.’\r\n\r\nBut Europe was not prepared to allow its interests to be any longer\r\nsacrificed by the selfish procrastination of two aged priests. In France\r\nBenedict’s chief supporter, the Duke of Orleans, had been removed by\r\nassassination in 1407, and Charles VI. was induced by the University to\r\nwithdraw his allegiance once more. Benedict replied by a bull of\r\nexcommunication against the French bishops, but the bull was burned, on\r\nthe proposal of the University. This boldness convinced Benedict that he\r\ncould no longer trust in France, and he fled to Perpignan, in his native\r\nstate of Roussillon. But meanwhile an important event had taken place in\r\nItaly. [Sidenote: The Cardinals desert the Popes.] The cardinals who had\r\nsupported the respective Popes shared the general disgust at the\r\nobstinate refusal of their masters to fulfil their oft-repeated pledges.\r\nThough the Popes had never met, they had come near enough to allow their\r\ncardinals to confer together. The result was that most of them abandoned\r\nthe Popes, put themselves under Florentine protection, and summoned a\r\nGeneral Council to meet at Pisa.\r\n\r\nThe European states were invited to approve the action of the cardinals\r\nby sending delegates to Pisa. The support of [Sidenote: The attitude of\r\nEurope.] France was assured, and England readily agreed to acknowledge\r\nthe Council. The Spanish kingdoms, on the other hand, remained passively\r\nloyal to Benedict XIII., and Germany was divided. Wenzel, who had never\r\ndone anything to carry out the policy of neutrality which he had\r\npromised France to adopt in 1398, agreed to support the Council on\r\ncondition that his title as King of the Romans was formally recognised.\r\nBut Rupert, although many of his chief supporters were inclined to\r\nfavour the cause of the cardinals, remained obstinate in his allegiance\r\nto the Roman Pope. Within Italy, Ladislas of Naples showed his\r\ndetermination to enforce his own interests by occupying Rome with his\r\ntroops. The two Popes, threatened with general desertion, made a tardy\r\neffort to conciliate public opinion by each summoning a council of his\r\nown. But very few prelates could be induced to attend, and the Council\r\nof Pisa only gained in importance by comparison with these\r\n_conciliabula_.\r\n\r\nAt Pisa the Council was opened on March 25, 1409. The [Sidenote: The\r\nCouncil of Pisa, 1409.] delegates present may be divided into two\r\nparties. The majority, including the cardinals who had summoned the\r\nassembly, desired merely to end the schism and to restore the old\r\norganisation in the Church. But some of the more enlightened\r\necclesiastics, such as d’Ailly and Gerson, wished to take advantage of\r\nan exceptional opportunity, and to effect such reforms in the Church as\r\nwould render similar scandals impossible in the future. Thus the\r\nprogramme of the Council came to be divided into the _causa unionis_ and\r\nthe _causa reformationis_. It was agreed to take the more pressing\r\nquestion of unity first, but to conciliate the reformers it was given to\r\nbe understood that the Council should not separate until it had\r\nconsidered the reformation of the Church, both in its head and its\r\nmembers. After this matters proceeded without any hurry, but without any\r\nconflict of opinion. Charges against the two Popes were drawn up and\r\npublicly read. Gregory and Benedict were cited to appear and answer\r\nbefore the Council. After the third summons they were declared\r\ncontumacious, and deprived of their usurped office and dignity. It is\r\nnoteworthy that the Popes were not deposed simply on the ground of\r\npublic advantage, or because they were not canonically elected; but\r\ndistinct charges were brought against them, and the Council claimed the\r\nright to impose the punishment of deposition. It was a novel spectacle\r\nfor Europe to see the principles of constitutional government applied in\r\nthe Church as they had been enforced in the English state in the cases\r\nof Edward II. and Richard II. With the ground cleared by the decree of\r\ndeposition, the cardinals proceeded to a new election, and after eleven\r\ndays’ deliberation, their choice fell upon the Archbishop of Milan, who\r\ntook the name of Alexander V. (June 26, 1409). The question of reform\r\nwas adroitly postponed for the consideration of a new council which was\r\nto meet in 1412, and the Council of Pisa was dissolved on August 7,\r\n1409.\r\n\r\nThe Council broke up under the impression that it had accomplished at\r\nany rate the most important part of its programme. But it was soon\r\nevident that the schism was as far from an end as ever. Neither Gregory\r\nnor Benedict would acknowledge the legality of the Council and its\r\nproceedings: and indeed it was not hard to question [Sidenote: The\r\ntriple schism.] the legality of proceedings that were undoubtedly\r\nrevolutionary and without precedent. The Council had no coercive power\r\nto enforce its edicts, and as long as the Popes could find any princes\r\ninterested in supporting them, so long they would cling to their titles.\r\nThe only difference that the Council had made was that, whereas before\r\nthere had been two rival Popes, there were now three. The pontificate of\r\n[Sidenote: Alexander V.] Alexander V. only lasted ten months. During\r\nthat period he succeeded in recovering Rome from Ladislas, but only by\r\nreviving civil war by the recognition of Louis of Anjou’s claim to\r\nNaples. His only ecclesiastical measure was a bull which endeavoured to\r\nsettle an old quarrel in favour of the mendicant orders. Alexander\r\nhimself was a Franciscan, and he recognised the full rights of the\r\nfriars to receive confession and to administer the sacraments. The bull\r\nprovoked a storm of opposition from the parish clergy, whose rights were\r\ninfringed by the intruding friars, and from the University of Paris,\r\nalways at war with the Franciscans. The University, which had so\r\nrecently welcomed the Pope’s election, now expelled all mendicants, and\r\ndemanded that they should renounce the privileges conferred upon them by\r\nthe bull. In the midst of this general disapproval, Alexander V. died\r\n(May 8, 1410), and the cardinals elected as his successor the clerical\r\n_condottiere_, Baldassare [Sidenote: Election of John XXIII.] Cossa, who\r\ntook the name of John XXIII. The new Pope had rendered great services in\r\nthe protection of the Council and the recovery of Rome, and he seemed to\r\nbe the only man who could be trusted to resist the threatening power of\r\nLadislas of Naples. But he had no pretensions to piety, or even to\r\nrespectability, and the elevation of a licentious soldier to the highest\r\necclesiastical dignity was in itself a scandal to Christendom almost as\r\ngreat as the schism itself.\r\n\r\nThe apparent failure of the Council of Pisa seemed to bring discredit\r\nupon its supporters and to justify the action of those who had held\r\naloof. But Rupert was not able to profit by any improvement this might\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Rupert.] have made in his position, as he died on\r\nMay 18, 1410, a few days after Alexander V. His death forced upon the\r\nwestern electors the problem of a new election, and ten years’\r\nexperience had so fully convinced them of the difficulty of overthrowing\r\nthe House of Luxemburg, that no candidate outside that house seems to\r\nhave been considered. There were now three surviving Luxemburg princes:\r\nWenzel, who still claimed to be King of the Romans; Sigismund, who had\r\ngained a considerable reputation by the success of his recent rule in\r\nHungary; and the ambitious Jobst, who had added Brandenburg and Lausitz\r\nto his inheritance in Moravia, and was now the chief adviser of his\r\ncousin in Bohemia. On the great question of the Church these princes had\r\ntaken opposite sides: Wenzel and Jobst had acknowledged the Council,\r\nwhile Sigismund had never withdrawn his allegiance from Gregory XII. The\r\nfour Rhenish electors, who alone had voted in the election of Rupert,\r\nwere equally divided on the same question. The Archbishop of Trier and\r\nthe Elector Palatine were adherents of the Roman Pope, while the\r\nArchbishops of Mainz and Köln supported Alexander V. and his successor.\r\nAs none of them were inclined to stultify their action in 1400 by\r\nrecognising Wenzel, the ecclesiastical differences decided their votes.\r\nThe electors of Mainz and Köln were in favour of Jobst, and the other\r\ntwo were inclined to support Sigismund.\r\n\r\nSigismund was the first to bring forward his claims, and he had much to\r\nrecommend him. He had compelled Bosnia to submit to his rule: the\r\nServians acknowledged the suzerainty of Hungary; and he had reduced\r\n[Sidenote: Election of Sigismund.] the greater part of Dalmatia, always\r\ninclined to set up a Neapolitan prince. Thus he could offer Germany the\r\nmost efficient protection against the Turks, while as heir to Bohemia he\r\nseemed the only man who could mediate in the growing hostility of\r\nGermans and Slavs. As he could not come to Germany in person, he\r\nintrusted his cause to Frederick of Hohenzollern, Burggraf of Nürnberg,\r\nwho had saved his life at the battle of Nicopolis, and had since become\r\nhis most intimate adviser. But in spite of Sigismund’s distinguished\r\nreputation, his chances of election seemed small if he could only secure\r\ntwo votes, and if Jobst gave the Brandenburg vote in his own favour. To\r\nget rid of this difficulty Sigismund determined to repudiate the bargain\r\nby which Brandenburg had been pledged to his cousin, and to claim and\r\nexercise the vote himself. He appointed Frederick of Hohenzollern to act\r\nas his proxy: and on September 1, 1410, the latter appeared with the\r\nfour Rhenish electors at Frankfort. This last move on Sigismund’s part\r\nfound his opponents unprepared. Jobst had made up his mind to stand by\r\nthe cause of Wenzel and to secure his own election on his cousin’s\r\ndeath. He and Rudolf of Saxony had declined to attend the meeting on the\r\nground that there was no vacancy. The electors of Mainz and Köln did all\r\nthey could to delay matters, but on September 20 the Elector Palatine\r\nand the Archbishop of Trier refused to wait any longer. Punctiliously\r\nfulfilling all the customary forms, they examined and approved the\r\npowers of the Burggraf of Nürnberg, and declared Sigismund to be\r\nunanimously elected. By the letter of the Golden Bull the election was\r\nincontestably valid, and even the doubtfulness of his claim to\r\nBrandenburg could hardly be urged against it.\r\n\r\nBut Sigismund’s opponents had numbers on their side, and were eager to\r\natone for the blunder they had made in allowing a march to be stolen\r\nupon them. Jobst induced [Sidenote: Election of Jobst.] Wenzel to make\r\nan agreement by which the latter was to be recognised as Roman Emperor,\r\nand in return confirmed Jobst in the possession of Brandenburg and\r\npromised to give the Bohemian vote in favour of his election as King of\r\nthe Romans. In October Frankfort witnessed a new election. Five\r\nelectors, either in person or by proxy, gave their votes in favour of\r\nJobst of Moravia. Thus for the second time events in the Empire copied\r\nthe example of those in the Church. The first schism between two rival\r\nPopes had been followed by a schism between two rival Kings of the\r\nRomans. In 1409 a third Pope was added, and the next year witnessed the\r\nunique spectacle of three princes of the same family each claiming the\r\nhighest temporal dignity on earth. There could be no clearer proof of\r\nthe unsuitability of mediæval conceptions to the conditions of Europe in\r\nthe fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe triple schism in the Empire was, however, of short duration.\r\nSigismund was preparing to attack his rival, when [Sidenote: Death of\r\nJobst.] Jobst suddenly died on January 12, 1411. His removal rendered\r\npossible an agreement between the two brothers. Sigismund recovered his\r\ninherited fief of Brandenburg, and intrusted its administration to\r\nFrederick of Nürnberg. Moravia was annexed to the Bohemian crown, and\r\nhas never since been severed from it. As regards the imperial dignity,\r\nWenzel agreed to give his own vote for Sigismund, as he had given it the\r\nprevious year to Jobst, on condition that his own title should be\r\nrecognised and that he should have a prior claim to be made emperor. The\r\nsupport of the Archbishops of Mainz and Köln Sigismund purchased by\r\nchanging his attitude on the Church question and abandoning the cause of\r\nGregory XII. On July 21, 1411, a third election took place at [Sidenote:\r\nSecond election of Sigismund.] Frankfort, when the five votes which had\r\nbeen given for Jobst were unanimously registered in favour of Sigismund.\r\nThe Elector Palatine and the Archbishop of Trier took no part in the\r\nmatter, as they refused to cast a slur on the legality of their previous\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nSigismund was now to all intents and purposes the only King of the\r\nRomans, as Wenzel made no attempt to busy [Sidenote: Sigismund and John\r\nXXIII.] himself with anything but Bohemian affairs. In his new capacity\r\nSigismund displayed the bustling activity and the readiness to turn from\r\none great scheme to another which had always characterised him. He began\r\nby making war on the Venetians, who had encroached upon Dalmatia. When\r\nthis war was ended by a truce in 1413, he entered Italy to reconquer\r\nLombardy from the Visconti. But he found the power of Filippo Maria too\r\nstrongly established to be easily overthrown, and he was about to retire\r\nwhen fortune threw another and more distinguished enterprise in his way.\r\nJohn XXIII. had succeeded to his predecessor’s alliance with Louis II.\r\nof Anjou and to the war with Ladislas of Naples. The defeat of the\r\nNeapolitan king at Rocca-Secca (May 19, 1411) induced him to conclude a\r\ntreaty by which he was to abandon Gregory XII. and John was to desert\r\nthe Angevin cause. But Ladislas had more ambitious aims than merely to\r\nsecure his position in Naples. He desired to build up a kingdom of\r\nItaly, and for this purpose to seize upon the States of the Church which\r\nlay between him and the northern principalities and republics. No sooner\r\nhad John XXIII. disbanded his mercenary forces than Ladislas resumed\r\nhostilities, occupied Rome, and drove the Pope to find refuge in\r\nFlorence. In this strait John looked eagerly round for support, and the\r\nmost obvious ally was Sigismund, who had his own reasons for checking\r\nthe aggrandisement of Ladislas. But Sigismund would only give his\r\nassistance on condition that the Pope should summon a new Council to\r\nsome German city in order to put an end to the schism. John saw clearly\r\nthe danger of such a proceeding to his own position, and strove to alter\r\nthe place of meeting to some town south of the Alps. Sigismund, however,\r\nstood firm, the Pope’s difficulties were pressing, and at last a formal\r\nsummons was issued for a Council [Sidenote: Summons of the Council of\r\nConstance.] to meet at Constance on November 1, 1414. Before the dreaded\r\ndate arrived, the death of Ladislas (August 6) freed the Pope from his\r\nmost immediate difficulties and caused him to repent of his too hasty\r\nacquiescence. Sigismund had apparently gained a signal triumph. He had\r\nousted the French monarchy from the lead of the reforming movement in\r\nEurope, and if he could conduct the Council to a successful issue, he\r\nwould have done much to restore the prestige both of the imperial\r\ndignity and of the German kingship. Men were reminded of the days when\r\nthe early emperors, Otto the Great and Henry III., had dominated the\r\nChurch as well as the State.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  See Genealogical Table I, in Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n      THE HUSSITE MOVEMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF CONSTANCE, 1409-1418\r\n\r\n\r\n    Questions before the Council of Constance—The Hussite Movement—Its\r\n    Political Aspect—Exodus of Germans from Prague—Hus at the Council of\r\n    Constance—Parties at Constance—Hus imprisoned—Attacks on John\r\n    XXIII.—His flight—Triumph of Sigismund—Deposition of John XXIII.—The\r\n    Council during Sigismund’s absence—Sigismund’s journey—Dissensions\r\n    in the Council—Election of Martin V.—Dissolution of the Council.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Constance, like that of Pisa, had two very [Sidenote:\r\nQuestions before the Council of Constance.] obvious questions to\r\nconsider: (1) the restoration of unity; and (2), if the reforming party\r\ncould have its way, the reform of the Church in its head and members.\r\nBut circumstances forced the Council to consider a third question, which\r\nhad never been even touched in the discussions at Pisa. This was\r\nreformation in its widest sense: not merely a constitutional change in\r\nthe relations of Pope and hierarchy, but a vital change in dogma and\r\nritual. This question was brought to the front by the so-called Hussite\r\nmovement in Bohemia. The fundamental issues involved were those which\r\nhave been at the bottom of most subsequent disputes in the Christian\r\nChurch. How far was the Christianity of the day unlike the Christianity\r\nto be found in the record of Christ and His Apostles? And the\r\ndifference, if any, was it a real and necessary difference consequent on\r\nthe development of society, or was it the result of abuses and\r\ninnovations introduced by fallible men? The orthodox took their stand\r\nupon the unity and authority of the Church. The Church was the true\r\nfoundation of Christ and the inheritor of His spirit. Therefore what the\r\nChurch believed and taught, that alone was the true Christian doctrine:\r\nand the forms and ceremonies of the Church were the necessary aids to\r\nfaith. The reformers, on the other hand, looked to Scripture for the\r\nfundamental rules of life and conduct. Any deviation from these rules,\r\nno matter on what authority, must be superfluous, and might very\r\nprobably be harmful.\r\n\r\nThe Hussite movement was older than Hus, and it was [Sidenote: The\r\nHussite movement.] partly native and partly foreign in its origin. The\r\nfirst impulse to religious reform is to be found, in Bohemia as in\r\nEngland, in the dissensions between the parish clergy and the mendicant\r\norders. The latter, being in immediate dependence upon the Papacy, were\r\nnot subject to the ordinary authority of the bishops, and soon learned\r\nto consider themselves superior to the parish clergy. The bishops\r\nusually supported their own dependants, while the friars often found a\r\npowerful ally in the Pope. One result of this long-standing quarrel was\r\nthat the people learned to question the authority of their\r\necclesiastical superiors. Wherever it is necessary or possible to take\r\none of two sides, a certain amount of thought and independence is called\r\ninto exercise by the choice. This first questioning spirit among the\r\nBohemians was taken advantage of by a series of reforming teachers in\r\nthe fourteenth century, of whom the best known are Konrad Waldhäuser,\r\nMilecz of Kremsier, and Mathias of Janow. These men attacked the\r\ndegradation of the Church, the vices of monks and friars, the wealth and\r\nworldliness of the higher clergy. But it was not until the rise of Hus\r\nthat there was any system in the demand for reform, or any cohesion\r\namong the reformers. And the systematic teaching of Hus was for the most\r\npart derived from the great English teacher, John Wyclif. It was a rule\r\nin the University of Prague that Bachelors of Arts might not deliver\r\ntheir own lectures, but must expound the teaching of distinguished\r\nprofessors either of Prague, Paris, or Oxford. The marriage of Anne of\r\nBohemia, Wenzel’s sister, with Richard II. led to considerable\r\nintercourse between England and Bohemia. Many Bohemian students, notably\r\nthe friend and disciple of Hus, Jerome of Prague, completed part of\r\ntheir course in Oxford, and returned to their native land carrying with\r\nthem Wyclif’s treatises, or the record and recollection of his oral\r\nteaching. Wyclif, like the Bohemian reformers, had begun by quarrelling\r\nwith the friars and denouncing the vices of the clergy. The disputes\r\nwith the Avignon Popes had led him on to attack the extreme claims of\r\npapal authority: and gradually he had come to question some of the most\r\nprominent dogmas of the Church, notably that of transubstantiation. Hus\r\nwas at first reluctant to accept all the conclusions of Wyclif, but he\r\nadvanced step by step in the same direction, and in the end it was as\r\nthe avowed disciple of the English reformer that he became the leader of\r\na religious party in Bohemia.\r\n\r\nBut it is important to remember that the Hussite movement had a secular\r\nas well as an ecclesiastical side. Bohemia [Sidenote: Political aspect\r\nof the Hussite movement.] was a Slav state, and for centuries there had\r\nbeen a conflict between Slavs and Germans. At one time the Slavs had\r\nadvanced along the southern shores of the Baltic almost as far as the\r\nNorth Sea. But, harassed by the attacks of the Magyars, they had been\r\nunable to hold their own, and had gradually been subdued or driven\r\neastwards by German influences, represented by the Dukes of Saxony, the\r\nMargraves of Brandenburg, the Hanseatic League, and finally the\r\ncrusading order of the Teutonic Knights. At the end of the fourteenth\r\ncentury this steady eastward advance of the Germans met with a severe,\r\nand to some extent a permanent, check. No doubt the chief agency in\r\neffecting this was the success of the Jagellon kings of Poland in their\r\nwar with the Teutonic Order. But the Hussite movement belongs to the\r\nsame Slav reaction, and for a time contributed almost as directly as\r\nPolish victories to assure the successful resistance of the Slavs. Hus\r\nhimself, born of humble parentage in the village of Husinec, was\r\nprofoundly imbued with popular sympathies, and lost no opportunity of\r\nidentifying himself and his teaching with the national cause. And in\r\nthis aim he was served by events in the University of Prague, where he\r\nearly rose to a distinguished position. Founded in the days of Bohemian\r\nascendency under Charles IV., the University had from the first\r\nattracted a large number of German teachers and students, and had become\r\nfar larger and more distinguished than any purely German university.\r\nLike the Paris University, on which it had been modelled, it was divided\r\ninto four nations—Bohemians, Poles, Bavarians, and Saxons. After the\r\nfoundation of a Polish university at Cracow, the Polish nation at Prague\r\nhad come to be composed mainly of Germans from Silesia, Pomerania, and\r\nPrussia. Thus to all intents and purposes the University was composed of\r\ntwo nations, Germans and Bohemians, of whom the former had three times\r\nas much power as the latter. In all questions which were decided by the\r\nvote of the nations, the Germans had three votes to one, and as offices\r\nwent in rotation to the four nations, they had three turns to the\r\nBohemian one. As the divergent interests of Slavs and Germans became\r\naccentuated by political and religious differences, the inferiority of\r\nthe Bohemians in their own University became more and more of a\r\ngrievance. It was on religious questions that the quarrel was most\r\nembittered. The majority of the orthodox party in the University\r\nconsisted of Germans, and they denounced the growth of Wycliffite\r\nheresy. A German teacher brought forward a number of propositions which\r\nhad been attributed to Wyclif and condemned by a Synod in London. In\r\nspite of the opposition of Hus and his Bohemian supporters, the majority\r\nin the University voted that the doctrines were heretical, and\r\nprohibited their teaching. Wenzel, who was at this time supporting the\r\nrebellious cardinals, was anxious that his intervention should not be\r\nweakened by the charge of the prevalence of heresy in his dominions, and\r\nwas at first inclined to support the majority. But when he applied to\r\nthe University for their approval of the Council of Pisa, he found the\r\nBohemians ready to acquiesce, while the Germans were mostly on the side\r\nof the Roman Pope. At this moment the so-called ‘contest of the three\r\nvotes’ was at its height, and Hus had adroitly come forward as the\r\nchampion of the cause of his fellow-countrymen. In the hope of\r\nforwarding his ecclesiastical policy, Wenzel was induced to intervene in\r\nthe University quarrel. In January 1409 he issued an edict that\r\nhenceforth the Bohemians should have three votes and three turns in\r\noffice, while the foreign nations were only to have one between them.\r\nThe Germans protested vigorously, and as they failed to obtain redress,\r\ndetermined to leave Prague. The roads were crowded with the emigrants,\r\nand it was reckoned that on one day two thousand Germans took their\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nThe exodus of the Germans from Prague is an important [Sidenote: Exodus\r\nof the Germans from Prague.] historical event. For sixty years Prague\r\nhad been the capital of Germany, partly as the residence of the Emperor,\r\nand partly as the seat of the leading University. With the students had\r\ncome German traders, who had made Prague a commercial as well as an\r\nintellectual centre. All this came to a sudden end in 1409. Prague lost\r\nits prominence among German towns. Other universities were strengthened\r\nby the addition of the exiles from Bohemia; and a large number of them\r\nfounded a new university at Leipzig. Germany received a great\r\nintellectual impulse, which was strengthened rather than weakened by the\r\nloss of a general centre. And for Bohemia the consequences were no less\r\nimportant. The German element in the country received a blow which was\r\nfatal to its further development for two centuries. At the same time the\r\ngreat dam which had hitherto impeded the spread of the new religious\r\ndoctrines was removed. The rapidity with which the people received the\r\nWycliffite or Hussite teaching shows not only that the soil was already\r\nwell prepared for the seed, but also the strength of the national\r\nantipathy to foreigners.\r\n\r\nWith the departure of the Germans, all opposition to the recognition of\r\nthe Council of Pisa by Bohemia came to an end. But the religious dispute\r\nwas as far from a settlement as ever. Although the people were inclined\r\nto regard Hus as the champion of the national cause, there was still a\r\nlarge orthodox party among the upper classes, and the clergy were\r\nresolutely opposed to doctrinal reform. Alexander V. issued a bull\r\nordering the Archbishop of Prague to put down heresy, and Wyclif’s\r\nwritings were publicly burned. Hus appealed from the Pope ill-informed\r\nto the Pope when he should be better informed. In 1412 the quarrel was\r\nenvenomed. John XXIII. had proclaimed a crusade against Ladislas of\r\nNaples, and endeavoured to raise money by the sale of indulgences. Hus\r\nprotested against such an iniquity as vigorously as did Luther a century\r\nlater, and the papal bull was burned in the public square. Riots broke\r\nout in Prague, and Bohemia seemed to be on the verge of civil war.\r\nWenzel could only obtain a temporary truce by persuading Hus to retire\r\nfor a time into the country. Meanwhile Sigismund had succeeded in\r\ninducing John XXIII. to summon a General Council, and anxious to pacify\r\nhis future kingdom, he invited Hus to attend. The reformer’s friends\r\nwarned him of the danger he would run in accepting the invitation, but\r\nHus was eager to state his opinions before an assembly of Christendom,\r\nand on receiving a promise of [Sidenote: Hus invited to Constance.] a\r\npersonal safe-conduct from Sigismund, he arrived in Constance on\r\nNovember 3, 1414.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Constance is one of the most notable [Sidenote: The\r\nCouncil of Constance.] assemblies in the history of the world. In the\r\nnumber and fame of its members, in the importance of its objects, and\r\nabove all, in the dramatic interest of its records, it has few rivals.\r\nIt is like the meeting of two worlds, the old and the new, the mediæval\r\nand the modern. We find there represented views which have hardly yet\r\nbeen fully accepted, which have occupied the best minds of succeeding\r\ncenturies: at the same time, the Council itself and its ceremonial carry\r\nus back to the times of the Roman Empire, when Church and State were\r\nscarcely yet dual, and when Christianity was co-extensive with one\r\nunited Empire. At Constance all the ideas, religious and political, of\r\nthe Middle Ages seem to be put upon their trial. If that trial had ended\r\nin condemnation, there could be no fitter point to mark the division\r\nbetween mediæval and modern history. But the verdict was acquittal, or\r\nat least a partial acquittal; and the old system was allowed, under\r\nmodified conditions, a lease of life for another century. It must not be\r\nforgotten that there were great secular as well as ecclesiastical\r\ninterests involved in the Council. Princes and nobles were present as\r\nwell as cardinals and prelates. The Council may be regarded not only as\r\na great assembly of the Church, but also as a great diet of the mediæval\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nThe man who had done more than any one to procure the summons of the\r\nCouncil, and whose interests were most closely [Sidenote: Parties at\r\nConstance.] bound up in its success, was Sigismund, King of the Romans\r\nand potential Emperor. He was eager to terminate the schism, and to\r\nbring about such a reform in the Church as would prevent the recurrence\r\nof similar scandals. But his motive in this was not merely disinterested\r\ndevotion to the interests of the Church. He wished to revive the\r\nprestige of the Holy Roman Empire, and to gratify his own personal\r\nvanity, by posing as the secular head of Christendom and the arbiter of\r\nits disputes. More especially he wished to restore the authority of the\r\nmonarchy in Germany, and to put an end to that anarchic independence of\r\nthe princes, of which the recent schism was both the illustration and\r\nthe result. In pursuing this aim he was confronted by the champions of\r\n‘liberty’ and princely interests, who were represented at Constance by\r\nthe Archbishop of Mainz and Frederick of Hapsburg, Count of Tyrol. The\r\narchbishop, John of Nassau, had been prominent in effecting and\r\nprolonging the schism in the Empire. He was a firm supporter of John\r\nXXIII., and had no interest in attending the Council except to thwart\r\nthe designs of the king, whom he had been the last to accept. Frederick\r\nof Tyrol was the youngest son of that Duke Leopold who had fallen at\r\nSempach in the war with the Swiss. Of his father’s possessions Frederick\r\nhad inherited Tyrol and the Swabian lands, and the propinquity of his\r\nterritories made him a powerful personage at Constance. His family was\r\nthe chief rival of the House of Luxemburg for ascendency in eastern\r\nGermany, and he himself seems to have cherished a personal grudge\r\nagainst Sigismund. To these enemies Sigismund could oppose two loyal\r\nallies, the Elector Palatine Lewis, who had completely abandoned the\r\nanti-Luxemburg policy pursued by his father Rupert, and Frederick of\r\nHohenzollern, the most prominent representative of national sentiment in\r\nGermany, who had already given in Brandenburg an example of that\r\nrestoration of order which he wished Sigismund to effect throughout his\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\nOf the clerical members of the Council the most prominent at the\r\ncommencement was the Pope John XXIII. He had been forced by his\r\ndifficulties in Italy to issue the summons, but as the time for the\r\nmeeting approached he felt more and more misgiving. His one object was\r\nto maintain himself in office; but he was conscious that neither\r\nSigismund nor the cardinals would hesitate to throw him over if he stood\r\nin the way of the restoration of unity. He therefore allied himself with\r\nSigismund’s opponents, the Elector of Mainz and Frederick of Tyrol, and\r\nspared no pains to bring about dissension between Sigismund and the\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nThe assembled clergy may be divided roughly into two parties: the\r\nreformers, and the conservative or ultramontane [Sidenote: Clerical\r\nparties.] party. The reformers were not in favour of any radical change\r\nin the Church. They were if anything more vehemently opposed than their\r\nantagonists to the doctrines of Wyclif and Hus. Such reform as they\r\ndesired was aristocratic rather than democratic. They had no intention\r\nof weakening the authority of the Church; but within the Church they\r\ndesired to remove gross abuses, and to strengthen the hierarchy as\r\nagainst the Papacy. Their chief contention was that a General Council\r\nhas supreme authority, even over the Pope, and they wished such councils\r\nto meet at regular intervals. By this means papal absolutism would be\r\nlimited by a sort of oligarchical parliament within the Church. The\r\nconservatives, on the other hand, consisting chiefly of the cardinals\r\nand Italian prelates, had no wish to alter a system under which they\r\nenjoyed material advantages. Their object, as it had been at Pisa, was\r\nto restore the union of the Church, but to defeat, or at any rate\r\npostpone, any schemes of reform.\r\n\r\nThe Council was opened on November 5, but the meeting was only formal,\r\nand no real business was transacted for a month. Meanwhile Hus had been\r\nfollowed to Constance by the representatives of the orthodox party in\r\nBohemia, who brought a formidable list of charges against the reformer.\r\nJohn XXIII. at once saw in this an opportunity for embroiling the\r\nCouncil with Sigismund. Adroitly keeping himself in the background, he\r\nallowed the cardinals to take the lead in the matter. They summoned Hus\r\nto appear before them, and in spite of his protest that he was only\r\nanswerable to the whole Council, they committed [Sidenote: Hus\r\nimprisoned.] him to prison. The news that his safe-conduct had been so\r\ninsultingly disregarded reached Sigismund as he was starting for\r\nConstance after the coronation ceremony at Aachen. He arrived on\r\nChristmas day, and at once demanded that Hus should be released. The\r\nPope excused himself, and threw the blame on the cardinals. To the\r\nking’s right to protect his subject the cardinals opposed their duty to\r\nsuppress heresy. In high dudgeon, Sigismund declared that he would leave\r\nthe Council to its fate, and actually set out on his return journey. The\r\nPope was jubilant at the success of his wiles. But Sigismund’s friends,\r\nand especially Frederick of Hohenzollern, urged him not to sacrifice the\r\ninterests of Germany and of Christendom for the sake of a heretic. This\r\nadvice, and the feeling that his personal reputation was staked on the\r\nsuccess of the Council, triumphed. Sigismund returned to Constance, and\r\nHus remained a prisoner. From this moment John XXIII. began to despair.\r\n\r\nThe Pope’s position became worse when the Council, copying the procedure\r\nof the universities, began to discuss matters, [Sidenote: Attacks on\r\nJohn XXIII.] not in a general assembly, but each nation separately. This\r\ndeprived John of the advantage which he hoped to gain from the numerical\r\nmajority of Italian prelates attending the Council. Four nations\r\norganised themselves: Italians, French, Germans, and English. Over the\r\nlast three John XXIII. had no hold whatever. To his disgust they treated\r\nhim, not as the legitimate Pope, whose authority was to be vindicated\r\nagainst his rivals, but as one of three schismatic Popes, whose\r\nretirement was a necessary condition of the restoration of unity. When\r\nhe tried to evade their demand, they brought unanswerable charges\r\nagainst his personal character, and threatened to depose him. He tried\r\nto disarm hostility by declaring his readiness to resign if the other\r\nPopes would do the same. His promise was welcomed with enthusiasm, but\r\nneither Sigismund nor his supporters were softened by it. In spite of\r\nthe vehement protests of the Elector of Mainz that he would obey no Pope\r\nbut John XXIII., the proposal was made to proceed to a new election.\r\nJohn had to fall back upon his last expedient. If he departed from\r\nConstance he might throw the Council into fatal [Sidenote: The Pope’s\r\nflight.] confusion: at the worst he could maintain himself as an\r\nAntipope, as Gregory and Benedict had done against the Council of Pisa.\r\nHis ally Frederick of Tyrol was prepared to assist him. Frederick\r\narranged a tournament outside the walls, and while this absorbed public\r\ninterest, the Pope escaped from Constance in the disguise of a groom,\r\nand made his way to Schaffhausen, a strong castle of the Hapsburg count.\r\n\r\nFor the moment John XXIII. seemed not unlikely to gain his end.\r\nConstance was thrown into confusion by the news of [Sidenote: Triumph of\r\nSigismund.] his flight. The mob rushed to pillage the papal residence.\r\nThe Italian and Austrian prelates prepared to leave the city, and the\r\nCouncil was on the verge of dissolution. But Sigismund’s zeal and energy\r\nsucceeded in averting such a disaster. He restored order in the city,\r\npersuaded the prelates to remain, and took prompt measures to punish his\r\nrebellious vassal. An armed force under Frederick of Hohenzollern\r\nsucceeded in capturing not only John XXIII. but also Frederick of Tyrol.\r\nThe latter was compelled to undergo public humiliation, and to hand over\r\nhis territories to his suzerain on condition that his life should be\r\nspared. No such exercise of imperial power had been witnessed in Germany\r\nsince the days of the Hohenstaufen, and Sigismund chose this auspicious\r\nmoment to secure a powerful supporter within the electoral college by\r\nhanding over the electorate of Brandenburg to Frederick of Nürnberg\r\n(April 30, 1415). He thus established a dynasty which was destined to\r\nplay a great part in German history, and ultimately to create a new\r\nGerman Empire.\r\n\r\nThe unsuccessful flight of John XXIII. not only enabled Sigismund to\r\nassume a more authoritative position in the Council and in Germany: it\r\nalso sealed his own fate. The Council had no longer any hesitation\r\n[Sidenote: Deposition of John XXIII.] in proceeding to the formal\r\ndeposition of the Pope (May 29, 1415). As the two Popes who had been\r\ndeposed at Pisa had never been recognised at Constance, the Church was\r\nnow without a head. But instead of hastening to fill the vacancy, the\r\nCouncil turned aside to the suppression of heresy and the trial of Hus.\r\nOn three occasions, the 5th, 7th, and 8th of June, Hus was heard before\r\na general session. No point in his teaching excited greater\r\nanimadversion than his contention that a priest, whether Pope or\r\nprelate, forfeited his office by the commission of mortal sin. With\r\ngreat cunning his accusers drew him on to extend this doctrine to\r\ntemporal princes. This was enough to complete the alienation of\r\nSigismund, and after the third day’s trial he was the first to pronounce\r\nin [Sidenote: Execution of Hus.] favour of condemnation. The last\r\nobstacle in the way of the prosecution was thus removed, and Hus was\r\nburned in a meadow outside the city walls on July 6, 1415.\r\n\r\nWith the death of Hus ends the first and most eventful period of the\r\nCouncil of Constance. Within these seven or eight months Sigismund and\r\nthe reforming party, thanks to [Sidenote: The Council during Sigismund’s\r\nabsence.] the division of the Council into nations, seemed to have\r\ngained a signal success. Sigismund had purchased his triumph by breaking\r\nhis pledge to Hus, and for this he was to pay a heavy penalty in the\r\nsubsequent disturbances in Bohemia. But for the moment these were not\r\nforeseen, and Sigismund was jubilantly eager to prosecute his scheme.\r\nWarned by the experience of its predecessor at Pisa, the Council of\r\nConstance was careful not to put too much trust in paper decrees. John\r\nXXIII. was not only deposed, but a prisoner. Gregory XII. had given a\r\nconditional promise of resignation, and had so few supporters as to be\r\nof slight importance. But Benedict XIII. was still strong in the\r\nallegiance of the Spanish kingdoms, and unless they could be detached\r\nfrom his cause there was little prospect of ending the schism. This task\r\nSigismund volunteered to undertake, and he also proposed to avert the\r\nimpending war between England and France, to reconcile the Burgundian\r\nand Armagnac parties in the latter country, and to negotiate peace\r\nbetween the King of Poland and the Teutonic Knights. It would indeed be\r\na revival of the imperial idea if its representative could thus act as a\r\ngeneral mediator in European quarrels. The Council welcomed the offer\r\nwith enthusiasm, and showed their loyalty to Sigismund by deciding to\r\npostpone all important questions till his return. And this decision was\r\nactually adhered to. During the sixteen months of Sigismund’s absence\r\n(July 15, 1415, to January 27, 1417) only two prominent subjects were\r\nconsidered by the Council. One was the trial of Jerome of Prague, which\r\nwas a mere corollary of that of Hus, and ended in a similar sentence.\r\nThe other was the thorny question raised by the proposed condemnation of\r\nthe writings of Jean Petit, a Burgundian partisan who had defended the\r\nmurder of the Duke of Orleans. The leader of the attack upon Jean Petit\r\nwas Gerson, the learned and eloquent chancellor of the University of\r\nParis. But so completely had the matter become a party question, and so\r\ngreat was the influence of the Duke of Burgundy, that the Council could\r\nnot be induced to go further than a general condemnation of the doctrine\r\nof lawful tyrannicide; and Gerson’s activity in the matter provoked such\r\nill-will that after the close of the Council he could not venture to\r\nreturn to France, which was then completely under Burgundian and English\r\ndomination.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to narrate here the story of Sigismund’s [Sidenote:\r\nSigismund’s journey.] journey, though it abounds with illustrations of\r\nhis impulsive character and of the attitude of the western states\r\ntowards the imperial pretensions. It furnished conclusive proofs, if any\r\nwere needed, that however the Council, for its own ends, might welcome\r\nthe authority of a secular head, national sentiment was far too strongly\r\ndeveloped to give any chance of success to a projected revival of the\r\nmediæval empire. As regards his immediate object, Sigismund was able to\r\nachieve some results. He failed to induce Benedict XIII. to abdicate,\r\nbut the quibbles of the veteran intriguer exhausted the patience of his\r\nsupporters, and at a conference at Narbonne the Spanish kings agreed to\r\ndesert him and to adhere to the Council of Constance (December 1415).\r\nBut Sigismund’s more ambitious schemes came to nothing. So far from\r\npreventing a war between England and France, he only forwarded an\r\nalliance between Henry V. and the Duke of Burgundy, and though he may\r\nhave done this in the hope of forcing peace upon France, the result was\r\nto make the war more disastrous and prolonged.\r\n\r\nWhen Sigismund reappeared in Constance (January 27, [Sidenote:\r\nDissensions in the Council.] 1417), he found that the state of affairs\r\nboth in Germany and in the Council had altered for the worse. Frederick\r\nof Tyrol had returned to his dominions and had been welcomed by his\r\nsubjects. The Archbishop of Mainz had renewed his intrigues, and an\r\nattempt had even been made to release John XXIII. With the Elector\r\nPalatine, formerly his loyal supporter, Sigismund had quarrelled on\r\nmoney matters, and it seemed possible that the four Rhenish electors\r\nwould form a league against Sigismund as they had done against Wenzel in\r\n1400. Still more galling was his loss of influence in the Council. The\r\nadhesion of the Spanish kingdoms had been followed by the arrival of\r\nSpanish prelates, who formed a fifth nation and strengthened the party\r\nopposed to reform. The war between England and France had created a\r\nquarrel between the two nations at Constance, and the French deserted\r\nthe cause they had once championed rather than vote with their enemies.\r\nSigismund could only rely upon the English and the Germans: and the\r\nquestion which agitated the Council was one of vital importance. Which\r\nwas to come first, the election of a new Pope, or the adoption of a\r\nscheme of ecclesiastical reform? The conservatives contended that the\r\nChurch could hardly be said to exist without its head; that no reform\r\nwould be valid until the normal constitution of the Church was restored.\r\nOn the other hand, it was urged that no reform was possible unless the\r\nsupremacy of a General Council was fully recognised; that certain\r\nquestions could be more easily discussed and settled during a vacancy;\r\nthat if the reforms were agreed upon, a new Pope could be pledged to\r\naccept them, whereas a Pope elected at once could prevent all reform.\r\nParty spirit ran extremely high, and it seemed almost impossible to\r\neffect an agreement. Sigismund was openly denounced as a heretic, while\r\nhe in turn threatened to imprison the cardinals for contumacy. But\r\ngradually the balance turned against the reformers. Some of the leading\r\nGerman bishops were bribed to change their votes. The head of the\r\nEnglish representatives, Robert Hallam, Bishop of Salisbury, died at the\r\ncritical moment, and the influence of Henry Beaufort, the future\r\ncardinal, induced the English nation to support an immediate election.\r\nIt was agreed that a new Pope should be chosen at once, and that the\r\nCouncil should then proceed to the work of reform. But the only\r\npreliminary concession that Sigismund and his party could obtain was the\r\nissue of a decree in October 1417, that another Council should meet\r\nwithin five years, a second within seven years, and that afterwards a\r\nCouncil should be regularly held every ten years.\r\n\r\nFor the new election it was decided that the twenty-three cardinals\r\nshould be joined by thirty delegates of the Council, six from each\r\nnation. The conclave met on November 8, and three days later their\r\nchoice [Sidenote: Election of Martin V., Nov. 11, 1417.] fell upon\r\nCardinal Oddo Colonna, who took the name of Martin V. Even the defeated\r\nparty could not refrain from sharing in the general enthusiasm at the\r\nrestoration of unity after forty years of schism. But their fears as to\r\nthe ultimate fate of the cause of reform were fully justified. Soon\r\nafter his election Martin declared that it was impious to appeal to a\r\nCouncil against a papal decision. Such a declaration, as Gerson said,\r\nnullified the acts of the Councils of Pisa and Constance, including the\r\nelection of the Pope himself. In their indignation the members made a\r\nstrong appeal to the Pope to fulfil the conditions agreed upon before\r\nhis election. But Martin had a weapon to hand which had been furnished\r\nby the Council itself. It was the division into nations that had led to\r\nthe fall of John XXIII., and it was the same division into nations that\r\nhad ruined the prospects of reform. The Pope now drew up a few scanty\r\narticles of reform, which he offered as separate concordats to the\r\nFrench, Germans, and English. It was a dangerous expedient for a Pope to\r\nadopt, because it seemed to imply the separate existence of national\r\nchurches; but it answered its immediate purpose. Martin could contend\r\nthat there was no longer any work for the Council to do, and he\r\ndissolved it in May 1418. He set out [Sidenote: Dissolution of the\r\nCouncil, May, 1418.] for Italy, where a difficult task awaited him.\r\nPapal authority in Rome had ceased with the flight of John XXIII. in\r\n1414. Sigismund offered the Pope a residence in some German city, but\r\nMartin wisely refused. The support of his own family, the Colonnas,\r\nenabled him to re-enter Rome in 1421. By that time almost all traces of\r\nthe schism had disappeared. Gregory XII. was dead: John XXIII. had\r\nrecently died in Florence: Benedict XIII. still held out in his fortress\r\nof Peniscola, but was impotent in his isolation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n          THE HUSSITE WARS AND THE COUNCIL OF BASEL, 1419-1449\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sigismund and Germany—Hussite parties in Bohemia—Crusades against\r\n    the Hussites—Bohemian victories—Bohemia and Poland—Attempted\r\n    reforms in Germany—The Crusade of 1427—Reforms of 1427—The Crusade\r\n    of 1431—Summons of the Council of Basel—Its procedure—Its quarrel\r\n    with Eugenius IV.—His submission—The Compacts with Bohemia—Civil\r\n    war in Bohemia—Battle of Lipan—Sigismund acknowledged king of\r\n    Bohemia—The Council of Basel and reforms—Divisions within the\r\n    Council—Negotiations with the Greeks—Quarrel of the Pope and\r\n    Council—Council of Ferrara or Florence—Attitude of France and\r\n    Germany—The Pragmatic Sanction—Deposition of Eugenius IV.—Election\r\n    of Felix V.—The Council’s prestige declines—Triumph of Eugenius\r\n    IV.—Reconciliation of Germany to Eugenius IV.—Close of the Council\r\n    of Basel—Failure of the Conciliar Movement.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate failure of the reforming party at Constance had [Sidenote:\r\nSigismund and Germany.] ruined all Sigismund’s schemes for the\r\nrestoration of monarchical authority in Germany. Ready as he was to form\r\nmagnificent projects, he was equally easily discouraged and turned\r\naside. After quitting the Council he devoted himself to personal and\r\ndynastic interests, to the defence of Hungary against the Turks, and to\r\nthe enforcement of his claim to succeed in Bohemia. Germany and German\r\ninterests he abandoned almost as completely as his brother had done. The\r\nresult was a gradual rupture of the friendship that had hitherto existed\r\nbetween himself and Frederick of Brandenburg. The latter had made it his\r\nlife’s task to restore unity to Germany, in order to save that country\r\nfrom internal dissolution and foreign attack. The desertion of Sigismund\r\nfrom what had been a common cause forced him to change his means, but\r\nnot his end. Hitherto he had striven to unite Germany under the\r\nmonarchy, but that was impossible when the king would not undertake to\r\ngovern. Frederick was forced to scheme for a federal union of Germany\r\nwhich should be independent of, and perhaps hostile to, the monarchy.\r\nAnd the necessity of some such union was made more and more manifest by\r\nevents in Bohemia.\r\n\r\nIn Bohemia the news of Hus’s death had provoked a storm of indignation,\r\nand had intensified the national sentiment of hostility to Germany.\r\nSigismund was regarded [Sidenote: Hussite parties in Bohemia.] with\r\nspecial loathing as a perjured traitor as well as a party to a murder.\r\nEven the sluggish Wenzel shared the sentiments of his subjects. He\r\nbitterly reviled his brother for breaking his safe-conduct, ordered that\r\nno Bohemian should henceforth appear before a foreign tribunal, and\r\nshowed special favour to the party which demanded vengeance for Hus’s\r\ndeath. Under the leadership of Nicolas of Husinec, lord of the village\r\nwhere Hus had been born, and of John Ziska, already known as a capable\r\nmilitary leader, the Hussites made great strides towards ascendency in\r\nBohemia. The chief doctrine which they advanced was the communion in\r\nboth kinds. They held that laymen were entitled to receive the cup in\r\nthe sacrament as well as the priests, and hence, as a religious party,\r\nthey received the name of Utraquists. But though they were united in\r\nthis contention, and also in common hostility to Germany and German\r\ninfluences, there were important divisions among the Hussites. The\r\nmoderate party, or Calixtines, were in favour of a gradual reform, and\r\nwished to separate political from religious questions. They were also\r\ncalled Pragers, because they were strongest in the capital and in the\r\nUniversity of Prague. In 1420 their demands were formulated in the ‘four\r\narticles of Prague,’ which became the avowed creed of the party. These\r\nwere: (1) complete liberty of preaching; (2) the communion in both kinds\r\nfor all Christians; (3) the exclusion of priests from temporal affairs\r\nand the holding of property; (4) the subjection of clergy to secular\r\npenalties for crimes and misdemeanours. But side by side with the\r\nCalixtines was a radical and democratic party, known as the Taborites.\r\nLike the Lollards in England, they mixed up social and religious\r\nquestions, and advocated republican and even communistic theories.\r\n\r\nThe death of Wenzel in 1419 added a new element of bitterness to the\r\nquarrel between the Hussites and the [Sidenote: Crusades against the\r\nHussites.] champions of orthodoxy. The obvious heir to the crown was\r\nSigismund, the only surviving male of the Luxemburg house. But Sigismund\r\nwas regarded as peculiarly responsible for Hus’s death, and as the\r\nrepresentative of all that was foreign and anti-Bohemian. It was\r\ninevitable that his claim should be resisted, or only accepted on very\r\nstringent conditions. At the moment Sigismund was engaged in a Turkish\r\nwar, and left the government in the hands of Wenzel’s widow. But as soon\r\nas possible he patched up a truce with the Turks, and prepared to take\r\npossession of his new kingdom. Frederick of Brandenburg urged him to\r\nadopt a conciliatory policy, to play off one party against the other,\r\nand to gain over the moderates by a few concessions in religious\r\nmatters. But Sigismund was eager to secure the support of the Pope, who\r\nwas resolutely opposed to any tampering with heresy; and most of his\r\nGerman advisers urged that any concessions to his subjects would make\r\nthem haughty and disobedient in the future. The counsel of Frederick of\r\nBrandenburg was rejected, and in March 1420 Martin V. published a\r\ncrusade against the Hussites. A German army was to be raised to\r\nprosecute the religious war. No decision could have been more\r\ndisastrous. Party divisions in Bohemia were at once reconciled, and all\r\nclasses joined in maintaining a national resistance against a common\r\nfoe. And this resistance [Sidenote: Bohemian victories, 1420-22.] was\r\ncompletely successful. Ziska proved to be a general of the first rank.\r\nNot only did he give to his troops the cohesion and discipline of a\r\nstanding army, but he introduced innovations which mark an epoch in the\r\nhistory of mediæval warfare. Especially prominent is the excellence of\r\nhis artillery, and the use which he made of his baggage-waggons. These\r\nwere formed into a sort of movable fortress, equally formidable both for\r\ndefence and aggression. The German armies opposed to him were the feudal\r\nlevies, collected from various states, bound together by no common\r\ninterests or enthusiasms, and recognising no common discipline or\r\nauthority. In three successive campaigns—1420, 1421, and 1422—the\r\nGermans were routed and driven from Bohemia, until at last the mere\r\nrumour of Ziska’s approach was sufficient to drive his enemies into\r\ndisorderly and panic-stricken flight. A contemporary says that the\r\nGermans were inspired with such a loathing for heretics that they could\r\nnot bring themselves to strike them, or even to look them in the face.\r\n\r\nAfter the failure of the third crusade in 1422, Bohemia was left to\r\nherself for five years. Nicolas of Husinec had died in 1421, Ziska was\r\ncarried off by the plague in 1424, and the leadership of the militant\r\nparty passed to a general of hardly less ability, Prokop. With the\r\nremoval of external danger, the bond which had held parties together was\r\nbroken, the old divisions and quarrels reappeared, and the country was a\r\nprey to the horrors of civil war. An attempt was made to identify the\r\ncommon interests of the Slav race in opposition to Germany by offering\r\nthe crown to [Sidenote: Bohemia and Poland.] Ladislas of Poland. But\r\nLadislas was afraid of compromising his position by an alliance with\r\nheretics, and though his nephew Korybut was for a time sent into\r\nBohemia, the opportunity of forming a powerful Slav monarchy on the\r\nfrontier of Germany was allowed to slip.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the humiliation of successive and crushing defeats had made a\r\nprofound impression in Germany. The battle of Brescia (_v._ p. 196) had\r\nalready shown the weakness of German arms; but the failure to crush the\r\nHussites proved that the military and political systems of Germany were\r\nequally [Sidenote: Attempted reforms in Germany.] rotten. The more\r\npatriotic of the princes, like Frederick of Brandenburg, were driven to\r\nconsider the necessity of some drastic reform. The restoration of\r\nmonarchical authority was the most obvious remedy for disorder, but the\r\ngeneral distrust of Sigismund put that out of the question. The old\r\nalliance of the Hohenzollerns with the Luxemburg kings had now come to\r\nan end. In 1422 Albert III., the last of the Ascanian electors of\r\nSaxony, died, leaving no obvious heir. His only daughter was married to\r\nthe eldest son of the Elector of Brandenburg. A few years earlier\r\nSigismund would have welcomed the opportunity of increasing the\r\nterritorial and political influence of his chief supporter in Germany.\r\nBut things had changed since the Council of Constance, the Hohenzollern\r\nclaims were disregarded, and the vacant electorate was conferred by\r\nSigismund upon Frederick of Meissen, the founder of the Wettin line in\r\nSaxony, which rules there in the present day. This marks the final\r\nrupture between Sigismund and the Elector of Brandenburg; and in\r\nattempting to reform the constitution of Germany the latter found\r\nhimself in opposition to his former patron. In 1422 it had been proposed\r\nat a diet at Nürnberg to raise a mercenary army in place of the feudal\r\ntroops, and to defray the expense by levying a general imperial tax of\r\none per cent., ‘the hundredth penny,’ as it was called. But this project\r\nwas foiled by the opposition of the towns, who feared that they would\r\nhave to pay the money while the princes would pocket it. In 1424 the\r\nelectors formed a close league among themselves, and practically assumed\r\nto act as if they were the joint heads of a federation. Sigismund was\r\nfurious at this open disregard of his authority, and prepared to go to\r\nwar against Frederick of Brandenburg and his associates. Hostilities had\r\nactually broken out, when the news arrived that the Hussites, who had\r\nhitherto been content with standing on the defensive, were invading the\r\nneighbouring German provinces. The Pope was roused by this to make new\r\nefforts for the success of a crusade, and he [Sidenote: The fourth\r\ncrusade, 1427.] appointed Cardinal Beaufort, the uncle of Henry VI. of\r\nEngland, to act as papal legate. At the same time another attempt was\r\nmade to strengthen the military organisation of Germany. At a diet at\r\nFrankfort (April 1427) the old mode of levying troops was abandoned, and\r\nit was agreed that one out of every twenty adult males should be chosen\r\nby lot. In this way it was hoped to eradicate the provincial jealousies,\r\nwhich had hitherto been a fatal source of discord. Frederick of\r\nBrandenburg was to act as commander-in-chief. But the financial\r\ndifficulty was still in the way. None of the proposed taxes could be\r\ncarried, and at last they had to fall back upon the tenths granted by\r\nthe Pope and a poll-tax on the Jews. The army collected was the largest\r\nthat had yet been employed in the war; but the result was all the more\r\nignominious. On the news that Prokop and his dreaded Taborites were at\r\nhand, the crusaders fled in headlong confusion. On the frontier they\r\nwere met by Cardinal Beaufort, who implored them to return, and in his\r\nrage tore the imperial standard to pieces, and trampled it underfoot.\r\nBut it was all in vain, and the legate was swept away with the\r\npanic-stricken mob.\r\n\r\nThis was the most ignominious reverse yet experienced, and under the\r\nimpression which it produced a new diet at [Sidenote: Reforms of 1427.]\r\nFrankfort hastened to adopt the most far-reaching reforms. A regular\r\nincome-tax was imposed, and a general poll-tax graduated according to\r\nrank. The revenue thus derived was to be collected by local delegates,\r\nand paid to the central power. But this central power was not the German\r\nmonarchy. The two commanders-in-chief, Cardinal Beaufort and Frederick\r\nof Brandenburg, were to be aided by a council of nine, consisting of one\r\nnominee of each of the six electors, and three representatives of the\r\nimperial towns. This body was authorised to raise fresh troops, or to\r\nlevy additional taxes. Such an arrangement amounted to a practical\r\ndeposition of Sigismund, whose authority was transferred to this new\r\nfederal council. But the reform was little more than a paper scheme. The\r\nforces of disunion were too strong to be readily overcome. Much of the\r\nmoney remained unpaid, and in consequence the troops could neither be\r\nraised nor equipped. Frederick of Brandenburg was forced to fall back\r\nupon the policy of negotiation which he had always favoured. He saw\r\nclearly that every invasion of Bohemia strengthened the extreme party,\r\nand that the only prospect of settlement lay in gaining over the\r\nmoderates to the German side. But the negotiations were foiled by the\r\nirresolution of Sigismund, the discord among the German princes, and the\r\nobstinacy of the Pope. Cardinal Beaufort was ordered to lead a new\r\ncrusade in 1429, but he found it necessary to disarm domestic opponents\r\nby sending the troops he had raised to serve in France. Martin V. was\r\nfurious but impotent. In 1430 he appointed a new legate, Cardinal\r\nCesarini, in [Sidenote: Fifth crusade, 1431.] place of Beaufort, and in\r\n1431 a German army was at last collected on the principles laid down in\r\n1427. In August it crossed the frontier, and encamped under the walls of\r\nTauss. But on the news of Prokop’s approach, the old panic set in, and\r\nthe troops fled in confusion. With the so-called battle of Tauss the\r\nfifth crusade, the last effort to crush the Hussite by force of arms,\r\ncame to an end. The war had lasted twelve years, and had given\r\nconvincing proofs of the evils of provincial disunion, but it had come\r\ntwo centuries too late to inspire the Germans with a sense of national\r\nduties and interests. From this time the only hope of restoring peace in\r\neastern Europe lay in the proceedings of the General Council, which had\r\nalready been summoned to meet at Basel.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important decrees of the Council of Constance had\r\nprovided for the sequence of future councils; and [Sidenote: Summons of\r\nthe Council of Basel, 1431.] though Martin V. looked upon the\r\narrangement with profound mistrust, he dared not wholly disregard it.\r\nThe first of these assemblies met in 1423, first at Pavia and then at\r\nSiena. It was attended only by Italian prelates, who were easily\r\nmanageable, and it was dissolved without passing any important\r\nenactments except that its successor was to meet in 1431 at Basel. As\r\nthe time approached Martin began to be filled with dread of another\r\nCouncil beyond the Alps. But the condition of Europe was too disturbed,\r\nand the danger too great of allowing Bohemian heresy to spread, for him\r\nto run the risk of alienating Germany by changing the place of meeting.\r\nOn February 1 he ordered the Council to meet on March 4, and appointed\r\nCardinal Cesarini to preside as his representative. On February 20\r\nMartin V. died, leaving his successor Eugenius IV. to face the dangers\r\nand difficulties which he foresaw.\r\n\r\nVery few prelates appeared in Basel at the appointed date; but the\r\ndefeat of the Germans at Tauss suddenly gave great importance to the\r\nCouncil, as offering the only prospect of the conclusion of peace. In\r\nSeptember Cesarini arrived from Bohemia, and from this time numbers\r\nrapidly increased. The first matter for consideration [Sidenote:\r\nProcedure of the Council.] was the method of procedure. It was decided\r\nto abandon the division into nations, which had been tried at Constance,\r\non the ground that national jealousy weakened the unity of the Council.\r\nInstead, the Council was to be divided into four deputations, composed\r\nof representatives from each nation. Each deputation was to consider a\r\nseparate subject: (1) the restoration of peace; (2) matters of doctrine\r\nand faith; (3) the reform of the Church; (4) the general business of the\r\nCouncil. When a matter had been discussed in a deputation, it was to be\r\nbrought before the whole Council, and votes were to be taken by\r\ndeputations. If they were equally divided, the deputations were to be\r\nre-formed, and the question debated afresh. A committee of twelve was\r\nformed to arrange the division into deputations, and to decide on the\r\nright of any individual to take part in the Council. From the first this\r\ncommittee took a very broad view in this matter, and the result was that\r\nthe Council soon began to assume a democratic character. At Constance\r\nthe great prelates and university dignitaries had been the dominant\r\nforce: at Basel power tended to fall into the hands of the mass of the\r\nclergy.\r\n\r\nThe most pressing business of the Council was to negotiate with the\r\nvictorious Hussites, and under the influence of Cesarini it was decided\r\nto invite the Bohemians to send delegates to Basel. This gave the\r\ngreatest umbrage in Rome, where the dangers from Bohemia were less\r\nkeenly felt, and the prejudice against any dealings [Sidenote: Quarrel\r\nwith Eugenius IV.] with excommunicated heretics was strongest. Eugenius\r\nIV., who was much less prudent and statesmanlike than his predecessor,\r\ndetermined to check such dangerous proceedings at the outset. On\r\nDecember 18, 1431, he issued a bull dissolving the Council, and\r\nsummoning another to meet in eighteen months at Bologna. The bull\r\ndropped like a bomb-shell in the peaceful deliberations of Basel, where\r\nno thought of the possible displeasure of the Pope had been entertained.\r\nBut after the first feeling of dismay, it was resolved to resist.\r\nCesarini was profoundly convinced that the dissolution of the Council\r\nwould result in the complete alienation of Germany and the triumph of\r\nthe Hussite heresy, and he wrote an earnest letter to explain his views.\r\nSigismund and all the princes whose interests demanded peace were\r\ninclined to support the Council, which was thus emboldened to make a\r\nfirm stand against the Pope. In February 1432 it was decided that a\r\nGeneral Council could not be dissolved without its own consent; and in\r\nApril the Pope and cardinals were ordered to present themselves at Basel\r\nwithin three months. A new schism seemed likely to break out, not as\r\nbefore between rival heads of the Church, but between the Church itself\r\nand its head. The contest was between parliamentary and despotic\r\nauthority, and it was as difficult in the Church as in the State to\r\nreconcile their rival pretensions.\r\n\r\nIn the end the Pope was forced to give way, partly by the pressure of\r\nsecular interests, and partly by the difficulties in which he was\r\ninvolved in Italy. In 1432 Sigismund came to Rome to receive the\r\nimperial crown from the Pope, and [Sidenote: Submission of the Pope.]\r\nrefused to abandon the cause of the Council, which he hoped might secure\r\nhis tardy recognition in Bohemia. In 1433 the partiality of Eugenius for\r\nhis native city of Venice involved him in a quarrel with Filippo Maria\r\nVisconti. The mercenary troops of Milan, aided by the Colonnas, whom\r\nEugenius sought to abase from the position Martin V. had given them,\r\nlaid siege to Rome, and the Pope could only save himself from\r\nimprisonment by an ignominious flight to Florence. In these\r\ncircumstances he could hardly hope for a victory over the recalcitrant\r\nCouncil, and in December 1433 he abandoned the unequal contest. He\r\ndeclared the Council of Basel to be a lawful œcumenical council, and\r\nconfirmed its decrees.\r\n\r\nThe papal recognition came in time to give increased importance and\r\nauthority to the Council’s negotiations with [Sidenote: The Compacts\r\nwith Bohemia.] the Bohemians, which had been carried on without\r\ninterruption during the quarrel with Eugenius. Bohemian deputies,\r\nincluding Prokop himself—as redoubtable a theologian as he was a\r\ngeneral—had been admitted to Basel at the end of 1432, and had carried\r\non for three months a disputation with the speakers of the Council. The\r\nbasis of discussion was supplied by the four articles of Prague, and,\r\nthanks to the conciliatory temper of Cesarini, the controversy had\r\nrarely gone beyond the decencies of orderly debate. No definite\r\nagreement was arrived at at Basel, but it was agreed that delegates from\r\nthe Council should in their turn proceed to negotiate with the diet at\r\nPrague. There, after infinite labour, a rudimentary compromise was\r\narranged in what are called the _Compactata_. On the great question of\r\nthe cup the Council had to give way, and the Bohemians and Moravians\r\nwere to be allowed to receive the communion in both kinds. Liberty of\r\npreaching was nominally conceded, but it was added that priests must be\r\nordained by their ecclesiastical superiors, and that the authority of\r\nbishops must be obeyed. Clergy were to be punished for crimes ‘according\r\nto the law of God and the ordinances of the fathers.’ On the question of\r\nclerical property the Council gained the day. The right of the Church to\r\npossess and administer heritable property was fully recognised, and it\r\nwas declared sacrilege for a layman to interfere with it.\r\n\r\nThe _Compactata_ were very far from being an authoritative treaty, but\r\ntheir importance lies in the fact that they secured [Sidenote: Civil war\r\nin Bohemia.] the approval of the nobles and moderate party in Bohemia,\r\nwho had long desired the restoration of peace and order. The Taborites\r\nand the army, on the other hand, were resolute in condemning the\r\nproposed terms, and the quarrel developed into open war. At Lipan, in\r\nApril [Sidenote: Battle of Lipan, 1434.] 1434, the Taborites found\r\nthemselves confronted by men who had learned tactics in the same school\r\nas themselves. They were enticed from their waggon-fortress by a feigned\r\nflight, while a troop of cavalry cut off their retreat. Prokop himself\r\nwas slain, and the army, which had been so long the terror of Europe,\r\nwas almost wholly cut to pieces. With the downfall of the extreme party\r\nthe chief difficulty in the way of the restoration of the monarchy was\r\nremoved. But the nobles were not prepared for an unconditional\r\nsubmission to Sigismund. They demanded, among other things, a complete\r\namnesty and the exclusion [Sidenote: Sigismund acknowledged in Bohemia.]\r\nfrom office of all who refused to receive the communion in both kinds.\r\nSigismund found it necessary to at any rate feign compliance, and in\r\nAugust 1436 he made his formal entry into Prague. As a European question\r\nthe Hussite movement may be regarded as having come to an end. Not that\r\nBohemia was really pacified, or that the doctrines of Hus had been\r\nabandoned, but all danger of any general adoption of these doctrines in\r\ncentral Europe had disappeared. As long as the Hussites were supported\r\nby the forces of national enthusiasm they had been irresistible: their\r\ndefeat was due to their own dissensions.\r\n\r\nIn 1434 the Council of Basel was at the height of its power and\r\nreputation. Eugenius IV. had been forced to recognise its authority. Its\r\nnegotiations with the Bohemians had not [Sidenote: Reforming activity of\r\nthe Council.] indeed produced a definite treaty, but they had resulted\r\nin dividing the moderate from the extreme party, and the defeat of the\r\nlatter had brought a peaceful settlement within measurable distance.\r\nEncouraged by these successes, the Council undertook with energy the\r\ntask of reforming the Church. A series of decrees show how strong was\r\nthe dislike of the despotic rule of the Papacy. Papal reservations, by\r\nwhich the right of patrons to appoint to benefices were evaded, was\r\ndeclared illegal. The establishment of diocesan and provincial synods\r\nwas recommended. Appeals from the decision of a bishop to Rome were\r\nforbidden. But these measures were surpassed in boldness by an edict of\r\nJune 1435, which forbade the payment of annates, or the first year’s\r\nrevenue of a bishopric or benefice. This threatened to deprive the Pope\r\nof his chief source of revenue, and provoked a violent outcry from the\r\ncardinals and officials of the Curia. But Eugenius IV., still an exile\r\nfrom Rome, did not feel strong enough to resist. He accepted the decree,\r\nonly asking that some compensation in the way of national contributions\r\nshould be given him. This pusillanimity encouraged the Council to\r\nfurther attacks on the papal power. The unrestricted right of the\r\nchapters to elect bishops was confirmed: all papal commendations were\r\ndone away with: appeals from a General Council to the Pope were declared\r\nto be heretical.\r\n\r\nThe extreme measures of the Council were fatal to its unity. It was felt\r\nthat many of the decrees were inspired by French and German antipathy to\r\nItalian preponderance in the Church. At the same time the numerical\r\n[Sidenote: Divisions in the Council.] majority of the lower clergy was\r\nregarded with growing mistrust by the bishops and other dignitaries.\r\nReforms might begin with the Papacy, but were not likely to stop there.\r\nCesarini and other moderate men, who had supported the Council as long\r\nas the Bohemian negotiations were at a critical stage, were now inclined\r\nto rally to the cause of the Pope. This growing papal party found an\r\nactive and unscrupulous leader in the Bishop of Taranto, whose aim was\r\nto bring about an irreconcilable quarrel between the Pope and the\r\nCouncil. On the other side, the reforming and anti-Italian party was\r\nheaded by the Cardinal Archbishop of Arles, a prelate of unquestioned\r\npiety and learning, but a resolute antagonist of the Papacy and perhaps\r\na personal enemy of Eugenius IV. On the same side was a man destined to\r\nplay an important part in the history of the Council and of Christendom,\r\nÆneas Sylvius Piccolomini. He was a native of Siena who had come to\r\nBasel in the suite of the Bishop of Fermo, and had since acted as\r\nsecretary to various prelates. He had made a name for himself by his\r\noratorical powers, the purity of his Latin style, and his diplomatic\r\nability. He had attached himself to the reforming party, but no one\r\nsuspected him of having any firm convictions, and those who knew his\r\neasy and pleasure-loving nature can have had little expectation that he\r\nwould one day rise to the headship of the Church. Between the two\r\nextreme parties at the Council was a moderate section, headed by a\r\nSpaniard, John of Segovia, but it was neither numerous nor important.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel within the Council and the growing hostility between the\r\nCouncil and the Pope were both brought to a [Sidenote: Negotiations with\r\nthe Greeks.] head by the negotiations with the Greeks. The eastern\r\nEmperor, John VI., though not actually at war with the Ottoman Turks,\r\nfelt that they were closing round him on every side, and that an attack\r\non Constantinople was before long inevitable. In his despair he appealed\r\nfor the assistance of western Europe, and was prepared to purchase it by\r\nsacrificing the independence of the Greek Church. The idea of uniting\r\nthe Eastern and Western Churches had long been cherished by the Popes,\r\nand Eugenius IV. was the more eager to take the matter up as it offered\r\nthe prospect of a triumph over the hated Council of Basel. But the\r\nGreeks were fully aware of the divisions in the Western Church, and sent\r\nenvoys to the Council as well as to the Pope. Hence arose an eager\r\ncompetition as to which should gain control of the negotiations. The\r\nCouncil offered to send a fleet to bring the Greek prelates to the\r\ncoast, and to pay all the expenses of their stay at Basel. To raise the\r\nmoney necessary for the fulfilment of these promises, the Council\r\nusurped a papal prerogative and issued indulgences to those who would\r\ncontribute to the union of the Churches. Eugenius, on his side, issued a\r\nmemorial to the princes of Europe, in which he enumerated the misdeeds\r\nof the Council, and promised to undertake the reform of the Church with\r\nthe aid of another Council, which for the sake of the Greeks would be\r\nheld in some Italian city.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Greek question had provoked violent disputes in Basel. The\r\npapal legates proposed that for the convenience of the Greeks they\r\nshould adjourn either to Florence or to Udine in the territories of\r\nVenice. The moderate party suggested Pavia, [Sidenote: Open quarrel\r\nbetween Pope and Council.] as being less dependent upon the Pope, and\r\nthis received the support of Æneas Sylvius, who was beginning to veer\r\nround to the papal side. But the extreme party would not hear of either\r\nproposal. The Archbishop of Arles moved that the Council should remain\r\nat Basel or, if the Greeks preferred it, should adjourn to Avignon. The\r\ndebates were marked by the most unseemly behaviour, and it was with\r\ndifficulty that the reverend fathers could be restrained from laying\r\nviolent hands upon each other. The motion of the anti-papal party was\r\ncarried by more than three-fifths of the Council; but the next morning\r\nit was discovered that this had been abstracted, and that the decree of\r\nthe papal minority, duly signed and sealed, had been put in its place.\r\nThis audacious piece of trickery was attributed to the Archbishop of\r\nTaranto, and so great was the indignation against him that he found it\r\nadvisable to flee to Italy, where he was rewarded by Eugenius with the\r\ncardinal’s hat. And the anger of the majority was not diminished when\r\nthey learned that the Greeks had been persuaded to accept the papal\r\ninvitation to attend a Council in Italy. The Council was driven to the\r\nmost extreme measures to try and discredit the Papacy. In July 1437 the\r\nPope and cardinals were summoned to appear at Basel within sixty days to\r\nanswer the charges brought against them. On October 1 Eugenius was\r\npronounced contumacious for not having obeyed the summons. The Pope, on\r\nhis side, had issued a bull (September 18) dissolving the Council at\r\nBasel, and summoning an assembly to meet at Ferrara in order to effect\r\nthe union of the Churches. There was no longer any room in Basel for\r\npartisans of the Papacy, and by the beginning of 1438 Cesarini and all\r\nwho were frightened by the extreme measures of the Council had crossed\r\nthe Alps.\r\n\r\nEugenius presided at the Council which met at Ferrara in 1438 and on the\r\noutbreak of the plague was transferred to [Sidenote: Council of Ferrara\r\nor Florence, 1438-9.] Florence. Months were spent in futile debates on\r\nthe differences between the two Churches. By far the most prominent\r\nsubject of discussion was the great _filioque_ controversy. The Latin\r\nChurch had added these words to the original wording of the creed as\r\nfixed at the Council of Nicæa, while the Greek Church had never adopted\r\nthem. The other differences which gave rise to debate were the use of\r\nleavened or unleavened bread in the sacrament, the doctrine of\r\npurgatory, and the papal supremacy. The Greek Church, as the petitioning\r\nbody, was ultimately forced to accept, without being convinced, the\r\nRoman views on all four questions. A decree for the union of the two\r\nChurches was drawn up, and Eugenius thought he was celebrating the\r\ncrowning triumph of the Papacy (July 6, 1439). But, as far as actual\r\nresults went, the triumph was premature. The Greeks at home refused to\r\naccept the decision of their representatives, and clamoured that they\r\nhad been betrayed. Nor did John VI. gain any aid to make up for the\r\nunpopularity he had incurred. Western Europe was fatally divided against\r\nitself, and paid little heed to the safety of Constantinople. The union\r\nof the Greek and Latin Churches remained a mere document.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel between the Pope and the Council of Basel had become\r\nirreconcilable when the latter was deserted by all the adherents of\r\nEugenius, and when Cesarini was succeeded [Sidenote: Attitude of France\r\nand Germany.] as president by the Archbishop of Arles. The result of the\r\nquarrel could only be decided by the adhesion of the secular states to\r\none side or the other. The two states to which the Council chiefly\r\nlooked for support were Germany and France, the countries from which\r\nmost of the remaining members were drawn. But these two states, instead\r\nof warmly espousing the cause of the Council, seemed rather inclined to\r\ntake advantage of the schism to establish their own ecclesiastical\r\nindependence. In 1438 a synod of French clergy accepted the [Sidenote:\r\nPragmatic Sanction of Bourges, 1438.] famous Pragmatic Sanction of\r\nBourges, the foundation of the liberties of the Gallican Church. This\r\nmeasure adopted, in the special interests of France, most of the decrees\r\nagainst the papal power which had been carried in the Council as\r\napplying to the whole Church. France was beginning to recover from the\r\nprolonged wars with Burgundy and England, and the Pragmatic Sanction\r\noffered the supreme advantage of checking the drain of French wealth to\r\nfill the coffers of the Pope. In Germany Sigismund had died in 1437, and\r\nthe electors and leading princes began by adopting a policy of strict\r\nneutrality between the Council and the Papacy. But the policy adopted by\r\nFrance offered temptations both to lay and clerical princes, and a diet\r\nat Mainz drew up what was practically the German equivalent of the\r\nPragmatic Sanction [Sidenote: Pragmatic Sanction of Mainz, 1439.] of\r\nBourges. Annates were to be abolished, papal reservations and provisions\r\nforbidden, provincial and diocesan synods organised. The conception of\r\nnational churches, which had been encouraged by Martin V.’s concordats\r\nat Constance, seemed in 1439 to be strong enough to rend the Church in\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nThe loss of temporal support and the apparent success of the rival\r\nassembly in Italy did not soothe the temper of the councillors at Basel.\r\nIn spite of the vigorous opposition of the moderate party, they\r\nproceeded to accuse Eugenius IV. of heresy and schism, and by a decree\r\nof June 25, 1439, he [Sidenote: Deposition of Eugenius IV., 1439.] was\r\nformally deposed. It was now determined to proceed to a new election. As\r\nthe Archbishop of Arles was the only cardinal at Basel, it was decided\r\nthat he should be aided by thirty-two delegates from the Council. The\r\ntask of election was a difficult one, as the poverty of the Council made\r\nit necessary to choose a Pope who could afford to defray his own\r\nexpenses. At the fifth scrutiny it was found that twenty-six votes had\r\nbeen given for the Duke of Savoy, who was declared Pope, with the name\r\n[Sidenote: Election of Felix V.] of Felix V. From the first he\r\ndisappointed the hopes of his electors. Although he had been living in\r\nretirement since the death of his wife and had amassed a considerable\r\ntreasure, he had no intention of maintaining himself and the Council\r\nfrom his private funds. He demanded that he should receive a revenue as\r\nPope, and the Council was forced to go back on its own decrees and to\r\ngrant him a fifth of ecclesiastical revenues for a year. This measure\r\nwas certain to alienate all who had supported the Council in the hope of\r\ndiminishing clerical taxes, and as a matter of fact the tax was only\r\npaid within the territories of Savoy. From all points of view the\r\nelection was a very disadvantageous step. It disgusted those who had\r\nhoped for a substantial [Sidenote: Declining prestige of the Council.]\r\nmeasure of reform from the Council of Basel. As long as the dispute was\r\nbetween a General Council and the Pope, there were certain principles at\r\nstake which might induce men to give energetic support to one side or\r\nthe other. But by its last act the Council had merely revived a personal\r\nschism, of which Europe was already profoundly weary. The Council of\r\nBasel continued to exist for nine years after the election of Felix V.,\r\nbut every year its numbers and its influence steadily declined. Even the\r\nAntipope quarrelled with the assembly to which he owed his appointment.\r\nIn 1444 Felix quitted Basel and took up his residence at Lausanne.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate victory of Eugenius IV. was assured by the mistakes of his\r\nopponents. It only remained for him to [Sidenote: Triumph of Eugenius\r\nIV.] complete his triumph by securing the support of the temporal powers\r\nof Europe. While he resided in Florence his legates succeeded in\r\nrestoring the papal supremacy in Rome, and in 1443 he was able once more\r\nto return to his capital city. He was careful to avoid the mistakes in\r\nItalian politics which had cost him so dear in 1433. Even his\r\narch-opponent, Filippo Maria Visconti, was gained over to his side. The\r\nrecognition of France was purchased by the countenance which the Pope\r\ngave to the Angevin cause in Naples. But when the Neapolitan war ended\r\nin the victory of Alfonso of Aragon, Eugenius adroitly changed sides\r\nwithout forfeiting the French allegiance. He had thus put an end to all\r\nserious opposition in Italy. England and the Spanish kingdoms took\r\nlittle interest in the schism, and had no motive for supporting Felix V.\r\nThere remained Germany, which had openly declared for a policy of\r\nneutrality. Until the German king and princes could be gained over, the\r\nrevival of papal authority was incomplete. The task of effecting the\r\nreconciliation of Germany was undertaken and accomplished by one man,\r\nÆneas Sylvius Piccolomini.\r\n\r\nThe kingship of the Romans was transferred on the death of Sigismund to\r\nhis son-in-law, Albert of Austria. But Albert died within two years of\r\nhis elevation, and in 1440 the choice of the electors fell upon another\r\nHapsburg, Frederick _III._, Duke of Styria and Carinthia, and guardian\r\nin Austria of Albert’s infant son, Ladislas Postumus. As soon as\r\nFrederick had settled family affairs in the east, he came to Germany in\r\n1442 [Sidenote: Reconciliation of Germany to the Roman Pope.] to receive\r\nthe crown at Aachen and to consider the question of the schism. Envoys\r\nfrom Basel and from Eugenius IV. had already appeared before the German\r\ndiet, but their exhaustive arguments had not led to any decision, and\r\nthe neutrality was still observed. In 1442 Frederick III. visited Basel,\r\nand there took into his service Æneas Sylvius. The latter was convinced\r\nthat the cause of Council and Antipope was hopeless, and determined to\r\nwin his own pardon and advancement by rendering some conspicuous service\r\nto Eugenius IV. His diplomacy was as successful as it was unscrupulous.\r\nBy 1445 he had succeeded in arranging terms between his master and the\r\nPope. Frederick undertook to restore Germany to its obedience to Rome;\r\nand Eugenius in return promised to give him the imperial crown, to allow\r\nhim the nomination to certain bishoprics and benefices, and to grant him\r\na substantial bribe from the ecclesiastical revenues. It was a\r\ndisgraceful treaty, and in spite of the secrecy with which it was\r\nnegotiated, it became known that some such agreement was being made. The\r\nGerman princes were indignant at what they considered a betrayal, and\r\nwere resolute to vindicate their own independence of their elected king.\r\nThe electors of Trier and Köln, together with a number of electoral\r\nprinces, determined, as a protest against Frederick’s conduct, to adhere\r\nto Felix V. Thus the policy of neutrality was abandoned, and Germany was\r\nsplit into parties on the question of the schism. To make matters worse,\r\nEugenius IV., emboldened by his treaty with the King of the Romans,\r\nissued a bull in February 1446 declaring the Archbishops of Köln and\r\nTrier to be deprived of their sees as heretics and traitors. This rash\r\nact seemed to make reconciliation impossible. But Æneas Sylvius was\r\nequal to the occasion. The electors issued the most extreme demands:\r\nthat the Pope should withdraw his bull against the two archbishops, that\r\nhe should confirm the Pragmatic Sanction of 1439, acknowledge the\r\nsupremacy of General Councils, and summon a new council to meet in\r\nGermany in 1447. Æneas Sylvius journeyed to Rome, where he persuaded\r\nEugenius to restore the two archbishops, and to return a moderate answer\r\nto the electoral demands. Then he proceeded to Germany as papal envoy,\r\nbribed the Archbishop of Mainz to desert the electoral league, and did\r\nnot hesitate to alter the wording of the papal answer in order to\r\nconciliate German pride. By these means he avoided an open rupture, and\r\ninduced the diet at Frankfort to agree to terms, in spite of the\r\nprotests of the Archbishops of Köln and Trier. Then Æneas Sylvius\r\nhurried back to Rome, with envoys from the diet, in order to explain and\r\njustify his conduct to the Pope. He found Eugenius IV. on his death-bed,\r\nand it was necessary to hasten matters in order to avoid the\r\ncomplications that might arise with a new election. A provisional\r\nconcordat was patched up. A new council was to meet in some German town,\r\nbut only if the German princes were agreed. The supremacy of a council\r\nwas recognised, but in the most general terms, so as to avoid any\r\nreference to the assembly at Basel. The Pragmatic Sanction and the\r\nsuspension of annates were temporarily confirmed, until some final\r\narrangement could be agreed upon. These terms were accepted by Eugenius\r\non February 23, 1447, and four days later he died. His successor was the\r\nfamous scholar and collector, Thomas of Sarzana, who took the name of\r\nNicolas V. He was wise enough to follow the recent policy of his\r\npredecessor in German affairs. Æneas Sylvius returned to Germany to\r\ncomplete his work. The malcontent princes were gained over by separate\r\nnegotiations. When the obstinate Archbishop of Trier was induced to\r\nacknowledge Nicolas V., opposition in Germany was at an end. The final\r\nconcordat was arranged in 1448, and was based upon the provisional terms\r\nof the previous year. The clauses about the Council were accepted as\r\nthey stood, but on the other points the Pope gained substantial\r\nadvantages. Annates were restored, and the restrictions which had been\r\nplaced upon papal patronage by the Pragmatic Sanction were for the most\r\npart repealed.\r\n\r\nIt only remained to get rid of the moribund Council of Basel. A few\r\nbishops from Savoy and some clergy of humble [Sidenote: End of the\r\nCouncil of Basel, 1449.] rank were the only members left. Frederick III.\r\nsent an order for the dissolution of the Council to the civic\r\nmagistrates. The exiled members proceeded to Lausanne, and there, by the\r\nmediation of France, made terms with the Papacy. Felix V., who had never\r\nreceived the homage of a temporal sovereign, resigned the papal title in\r\nexchange for the cardinal’s hat. The Archbishop of Arles returned to his\r\nsee, where he was universally beloved. He died in 1450, and in the next\r\ncentury was canonised by Clement VII.\r\n\r\nWith the Council of Basel ended the conciliar movement for reform, which\r\nhad resulted from the scandal of the great [Sidenote: Failure of the\r\nConciliar Movement.] schism. It had failed, not from any lack of honest\r\npurpose, or from the blunders of its adherents, but because it was out\r\nof harmony with the conditions of the age. A few centuries earlier it\r\nmight have been possible to reform the Church, and at the same time to\r\nretain its unity. But by the fifteenth century such a scheme was too\r\nlate. Political division had advanced so far as to bring with it\r\necclesiastical divisions. The sentiment that was recognised in the\r\nconcordats of Martin V. and asserted in the Pragmatic Sanctions of\r\nBourges and Mainz, was stronger than the theory of the supremacy of a\r\ngeneral council over the Pope. The Reformation of the sixteenth century\r\nwas a series of national revolts against papal domination, and it owed\r\nits success to its harmony with political conditions and interests.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the conciliar movement brought with it a revival of papal\r\nauthority. The reaction which had commenced under Martin V. seemed to be\r\ncomplete under Nicolas V. The great jubilee which was held in Rome in\r\n1450 was a fitting celebration of the papal triumph. But it proved to be\r\nonly a Pyrrhic victory. The Papacy learned neither wisdom nor toleration\r\nfrom the trials through which it had passed. While continuing to trample\r\non the spirit of individual freedom, the Popes, in their greed for\r\ntemporal dominion, gave rise to scandals far more glaring from the moral\r\npoint of view than the senile bickerings of the schism. The Protestant\r\nrevolution more than avenged the defeat of the Councils of Constance and\r\nBasel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n          MILAN AND VENICE IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY, 1402-1494\r\n\r\n\r\n    Disruption of the duchy of Milan after the death of Gian Galeazzo\r\n    Visconti—Venice acquires Eastern Lombardy as far as the Adige—Wars\r\n    between Venice and Sigismund—Filippo Maria Visconti restores the\r\n    duchy of Milan—Wars between Venice and Milan—Venetian frontier\r\n    extended to the Adda—Death of Filippo Maria—Venice and Francesco\r\n    Sforza—Peace of Lodi—Deposition and death of Francesco\r\n    Foscari—Venice and the Turks—Treaty of Constantinople—War with\r\n    Ferrara—Acquisition of Cyprus—Decline of Venice—Francesco Sforza in\r\n    Milan—His relations with France—Galeazzo Maria Sforza—His\r\n    assassination—Regency of Bona of Savoy—Ludovico il Moro—His\r\n    relations with Naples—Calls in Charles VIII. of France.\r\n\r\nThe anarchy in the duchy of Milan, which followed the death of Gian\r\nGaleazzo Visconti in 1402, illustrates at once [Sidenote: Disruption of\r\nthe duchy of Milan.] the ability of its founder and the difficulties\r\nwhich he had succeeded in overcoming. He left his dominions to his two\r\nlegitimate sons, Gian Maria and Filippo Maria, who were to rule in Milan\r\nand Pavia respectively under the guardianship of their mother. But the\r\nwidowed duchess, Caterina, proved wholly unable to wield the power which\r\nher husband left in her hands. The _condottieri_, who had shown such\r\nunwonted loyalty to Gian Galeazzo, seized the opportunity to carve out\r\nprincipalities for themselves. In nearly every city of Lombardy the\r\nlordship was seized by some adventurer, who sought to make himself\r\nindependent. In Milan itself the cruelties with which Caterina sought to\r\nput down disorder provoked an insurrection. The duchess was imprisoned\r\nand poisoned (1404), and Gian Maria was intrusted with the government\r\nunder the guidance of a council of citizens. But Gian Maria carried the\r\ncruelty and debauchery of his predecessors to the verge of insanity. The\r\nonly use which he made of his power was to gratify his monstrous\r\npassions by the torture of his fellow-creatures. At last some semblance\r\nof order was restored by Facino Cane, one of the most eminent generals\r\nin the service of Gian Galeazzo. On the death of his employer he had\r\nmade himself master of Alessandria, Tortona, and other western towns.\r\nLater he had assumed the regency for Filippo Maria in Pavia, and he now\r\nreduced Gian Maria to similar submission. This authority he held till\r\nhis death, when the Milanese nobles, rather than allow Gian Maria to\r\nrecover the government, assassinated that youthful monster in 1412.\r\n\r\nThese disorders in Lombardy naturally led to the loss of the southern\r\nacquisitions of Gian Galeazzo. The hostility [Sidenote: Losses in\r\nRomagna and Tuscany.] of Pope Boniface IX. had to be bought off by the\r\nrestoration of Bologna and Perugia to the papal states (1403). Siena\r\nrecovered its republican liberties in 1404, and Paolo Guinigi maintained\r\nhis rule in Lucca as an independent prince. Pisa, the most important of\r\nthe Milanese conquests, had been bequeathed by Gian Galeazzo to a\r\nbastard son, Gabriele Maria. But Gabriele, finding himself unable to\r\nface the double danger of Pisan rebellion and Florentine attack, became\r\nthe vassal of France in order to gain the aid of Marshal Boucicault, the\r\nFrench governor in Genoa. Within a year, however, he had quarrelled with\r\nhis suzerain: the policy of France ceased to be hostile to Florence: and\r\nso the strange spectacle was seen of Boucicault and Gabriele, in mutual\r\nenmity, selling their sovereign rights to Florence, while the Pisans\r\nrepudiated the authority of both and reclaimed their old independence\r\n(1405). The Florentine oligarchy was prompt to seize the opportunity\r\nthat had long been looked for, and a strict blockade forced Pisa to\r\nsurrender after an obstinate resistance of many months (October 9,\r\n1406). By the reduction of the rival republic, Florence took the first\r\ngreat stride towards the formation of the later grand duchy of Tuscany.\r\n\r\nBut the most notable result of the temporary decline of Milan was the\r\npermanent establishment of Venetian dominion in Eastern Lombardy, an\r\nevent fraught with the most momentous consequences both for Venice\r\n[Sidenote: Venice acquires Verona and Padua.] and for Italy. Francesco\r\nCarrara, who had recovered Padua in 1390, and had been allowed to retain\r\nit under tribute to Milan (see p. 180), was one of the first princes to\r\ntake advantage of Gian Galeazzo’s death to obtain both freedom and\r\naggrandisement. In alliance with the surviving members of the house of\r\ndella Scala he seized Verona, and then got rid of his allies in order to\r\nkeep his conquest to himself (1404). From Verona he advanced to the\r\nsiege of Vicenza, but the citizens offered the lordship to Venice, while\r\nthe duchess Caterina, beset with difficulties in Milan, also appealed\r\nfor aid to the maritime republic. This double invitation, together with\r\nthe traditional enmity to the Carrara family, overcame any reluctance on\r\nthe part of the Venetians. They agreed to aid the duchess on condition\r\nthat all Milanese territory to the east of the Adige should be ceded to\r\nthem. Caterina accepted the terms, hard as they were, and in June 1404\r\nVenice declared war against the lord of Padua. Vicenza opened its gates\r\nto the Venetians, and in the course of 1405 both Verona and Padua were\r\ncompelled to surrender to superior forces. Francesco Carrara was carried\r\noff to die in a Venetian prison.\r\n\r\nVenice had now recovered and enormously extended the territories she had\r\nlost in the war of Chioggia. Not only [Sidenote: Venice at war with\r\nSigismund.] Treviso, Feltre, and Belluno, but Bassano, Verona, Vicenza,\r\nand Padua acknowledged her sway. And before long she was in possession\r\nof another province, Dalmatia, which she had gained from Hungary, and\r\nlost again in the previous century. Pope Boniface IX., engaged in a\r\nquarrel with Sigismund of Hungary, had stirred up Ladislas of Naples to\r\nrevive his father’s claim to the Hungarian crown (see pp. 154 and 191).\r\nIn 1402 Ladislas had landed at Zara in Dalmatia, and was crowned king by\r\nthe papal legate. But his early success was followed by reverses, and,\r\ndiscouraged by the memory of his father’s fate, Ladislas returned to\r\nNaples. But he was not unwilling to cause annoyance to his successful\r\nrival, and in 1409 he sold his rights in Dalmatia to Venice. This led to\r\na prolonged war with Sigismund, who in 1411 was recognised as king of\r\nthe Romans, and desired to gain distinction and authority in Italy. In\r\n1411 his troops occupied Feltre and Belluno, but they were defeated in\r\nthe open field by Carlo Malatesta in the service of Venice. In 1413 a\r\ntruce put an end to hostilities for a time, and Sigismund was enabled to\r\nconcentrate his attention on ecclesiastical questions and the council of\r\nConstance. But the possession of Dalmatia was still a subject of\r\ndispute, and war was renewed in 1418. Sigismund, however, was occupied\r\nwith the difficulties which the execution of Hus had excited in Bohemia,\r\nand Venice met with little efficient opposition. By 1421 the province of\r\nFriuli and almost the whole of the Dalmatian coast were subject to\r\nVenetian rule.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile important events had taken place in Milan. On the murder of\r\nhis elder brother, Filippo Maria Visconti [Sidenote: Filippo Maria\r\nVisconti.] had emerged from the obscurity in which he had previously\r\nlived, and showed himself not unfitted to fill his father’s place. With\r\neven greater personal cowardice, which induced him to conceal himself\r\nalmost entirely from human vision, he combined the same subtle powers of\r\nintrigue, and the same ability to discover and make use of military\r\ntalent in others. Only two defects of character prevented him from\r\nachieving the same measure of success as had fallen to Gian Galeazzo. He\r\nwas less resolute in the pursuit of his ends, and momentary\r\ndiscouragement led him at times to relinquish an object when it was\r\nalmost within his grasp. And his inveterate habits of suspicion involved\r\nhim not infrequently in serious danger by driving into opposition the\r\nmen who were capable of rendering him the most valuable services. It was\r\nimpossible to be loyal to a prince who distrusted a victorious general\r\neven more than he dreaded to hear of a defeat.\r\n\r\nThe first act of Filippo Maria was to marry the widow of Facino Cane,\r\nalthough she was twenty years older than himself. By this means he\r\nacquired Alessandria, Tortona, Novara, and Vercelli, and also the\r\ncontrol of Facino’s numerous and disciplined [Sidenote: He restores the\r\nduchy of Milan.] troops. With their aid he made himself master of Milan\r\nand avenged his brother’s death. Once secure in his position, he did not\r\nscruple to rid himself of his elderly benefactress, whose age rendered\r\nher an unsuitable spouse. In the attack upon Milan he had noted the\r\ncourage and conduct of Francesco Carmagnola, who took his name from the\r\nvillage near Turin where he had been born. He raised the Piedmontese\r\nsoldier to the command of his army, and employed him to reduce to\r\nsubmission the cities which had formerly owned his father’s sway. One\r\nafter another the despots who had usurped authority since the death of\r\nGian Galeazzo were compelled to surrender, and by 1421 the duchy of\r\nMilan extended from Piedmont in the west to the line of the Adige in the\r\neast. Even Genoa, which had freed itself from French rule in 1411, was\r\nforced after a prolonged struggle to acknowledge the suzerainty of\r\nFilippo Maria.\r\n\r\nThus Venice, at the very moment of her successful expansion eastwards,\r\nfound herself confronted on her western border by a prince who could\r\nadvance weighty claims to the most valuable of her recently acquired\r\ndominions. The republic was thus called upon to [Sidenote: Parties in\r\nVenice.] solve one of the most serious problems of her whole history.\r\nHitherto power on the mainland had come to her in the course of events;\r\nit had been the product of her obvious interest in protecting her trade\r\nroutes and the sources of her supply of food. There had not as yet been\r\nany deliberate going out of her way to seek for territories. But her\r\nmost pressing interests were now secured, and the question at once arose\r\nwhether she could or would stop at the point which she had reached in\r\n1421. Upon this question were formed the two great parties which divided\r\nVenice during the remainder of the century. The Doge, Tommaso Mocenigo,\r\nwho held office from 1414 to 1423, urged the maintenance of the _status\r\nquo_ as the only means of retaining that maritime supremacy which was\r\nessential for the defence of the overwhelming interests of Venice in the\r\neast. To enter into Italian politics as the avowed rival of Milan for\r\nascendency in Lombardy would inevitably result in handing over the\r\nLevant to the Turks. And if Venice lost her commerce, she would find\r\nterritorial dominion, which she could only gain and keep by employing\r\nhired foreigners in place of her own citizens, a very unsatisfactory\r\nsource either of wealth or of political greatness. On the other hand,\r\nmany of the younger nobles, headed by Francesco Foscari, laid stress\r\nupon the undoubted interests of Venice on the mainland, and upon the\r\ncertainty that the duke of Milan would never abandon his claims to\r\nVerona and Padua. They contended with vehemence that the western\r\nfrontier as it stood was hopelessly insecure, that a state must either\r\nadvance or lose ground, and that aggression is often the only means of\r\ndefence. But the policy of this party was really inspired less by these\r\narguments, sound as they were in some respects, than by the instinctive\r\ngreed for territory which had become the guiding motive of the great\r\nItalian states.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two parties was brought to a head in 1423 by\r\nthe appearance of successive embassies [Sidenote: Appeals from\r\nFlorence.] from Florence to demand aid against the duke of Milan.\r\nFilippo Maria had resumed his father’s schemes of aggression in Tuscany\r\nand the Romagna. Florence was forced into war to defend her\r\nindependence, and her troops suffered one defeat after another. Nothing\r\nbut the intervention of the great northern republic seemed likely to\r\narrest the duke’s progress, and the appeals to Venice became more and\r\nmore pressing. The first embassy in 1423 had been repulsed by the\r\ninfluence of Mocenigo, but he had died later in the year, and his place\r\nwas filled by the election of his opponent, Foscari. Still, parties in\r\nVenice were too evenly balanced to admit of a decisive intervention in\r\nthe war, and the Florentine envoys proceeded from prayers to threats. If\r\nVenice would give no aid, Florence would seek her own safety by joining\r\nwith Milan. ‘When we refused to help Genoa, she made Visconti lord of\r\nthe city; if you refuse to help us, we will make him king of Italy.’ At\r\nthe critical moment the Florentine appeal was reinforced by the arrival\r\nof Carmagnola, who had incurred the jealous suspicion of Filippo Maria,\r\nand had been driven in disgrace from his service. His announcement that\r\nthe duke would never be satisfied till he had driven the Venetians from\r\nLombardy, and the prospect of utilising so distinguished a general\r\nagainst his former employer, turned the scale in favour of Foscari and\r\nhis party. At the end of 1425 it was decided to join Florence in open\r\nwar against the duke of Milan.\r\n\r\nThe struggle opened with notable successes for Venice. Brescia was taken\r\nin 1426, and in December Filippo Maria confirmed its cession by a formal\r\ntreaty. But the treaty was only a device to gain time and to collect\r\nforces. In 1427 hostilities were renewed, [Sidenote: War between Venice\r\nand Milan.] and three of the most famous _condottieri_ of the\r\nday—Francesco Sforza, Niccolo Piccinino, and Carlo Malatesta—commanded\r\nthe forces of Milan. But Carmagnola gained a brilliant victory at Macalo\r\n(October 11), and in 1428 Visconti again made peace by handing over\r\nBergamo in addition to Brescia. Thus in two campaigns the Venetian\r\nfrontier had been extended from the Adige to the Adda. But Filippo Maria\r\ncould hardly remain satisfied with an arrangement which brought his\r\nenemies within striking distance of Milan itself. In 1431 the war was\r\nrenewed, and Carmagnola was induced by lavish payments and promises to\r\nremain in the service of Venice. The republic had now to face the\r\ndifficulties and dangers of employing mercenary soldiers. From the first\r\nthe practice had been adopted of sending two native nobles to the camp\r\nas _proveditori_. Nominally they were responsible for the commissariat,\r\nbut their real function was to keep a jealous watch on the conduct of\r\nthe general. Carmagnola had already incurred the suspicion of his\r\nemployers. Except in the battle of Macalo he had taken little personal\r\npart in the war, and had shown himself more solicitous of his own\r\ninterests than of those of Venice. He had released his prisoners without\r\nransom, in accordance with the etiquette of his profession, and had\r\nopenly conducted an independent intercourse with the duke of Milan. It\r\nseemed that he had no wish to go too far in crushing a prince whom he\r\nhad formerly served and might serve again. Still, as long as their arms\r\nwere successful, the Venetian oligarchy had kept their fears and\r\nsuspicion to themselves. But in 1431 came a series of reverses.\r\nFrancesco Sforza won a victory at Soncino, and the Venetian fleet on the\r\nPo was destroyed through the failure of Carmagnola to come to its\r\nsupport. Failure was taken as a proof of treachery, and the Council of\r\nTen determined to inflict an exemplary punishment.\r\n\r\nThey acted with characteristic duplicity and decision. Carmagnola was\r\ninvited to Venice to discuss the next campaign, and his distrust was\r\nremoved by a triumphal reception. But he was hurried from the palace\r\n[Sidenote: Execution of Carmagnola.] to prison, and a secret trial\r\nresulted in his condemnation and death (May 5, 1432). In the picturesque\r\nhistory of the _condottieri_ of the fifteenth century the execution of\r\nCarmagnola is one of the most famous episodes. He had done nothing that\r\nwas not in accordance with the traditions of his craft, but one state at\r\nany rate ventured to give striking proof that she would not allow\r\nindependence to her hired defenders. It was a dangerous dilemma from\r\nwhich Venice sought to extricate herself. A too eminent and successful\r\ngeneral might endanger her freedom, but it was difficult in the future\r\nto induce the ablest men to serve a state which was ready to exact such\r\nrigorous penalties.\r\n\r\nThe war continued for nine years after Carmagnola’s death. Florence was\r\nallied with Venice, and thus the attention of Filippo Maria was engaged\r\nin Tuscany as well as in Lombardy. This diversion was the salvation of\r\nVenice, which was more than once on the verge of losing not only\r\nBrescia, but also Verona. Fortunately for her, too, her rule was more\r\nlenient than that of Milan, and her subjects were resolutely in favour\r\nof their new against their former master. The struggle was complicated\r\nby the action of Francesco Sforza, who throughout played his own game\r\nand joined one side or the other as his private interest dictated. His\r\ndesire was to force Filippo Maria to give him the hand of his natural\r\ndaughter, Bianca, and to make this marriage the foundation of a\r\nprincipality in Lombardy. He was at last successful in attaining his\r\nend. The long siege of Brescia was raised by his intervention on behalf\r\nof Venice, and a peace in 1441 secured to Venice the possession of\r\nBrescia and Bergamo. In the same year Venice expelled the ruling house\r\nof Polenta from Ravenna, and took possession of that city, a step which\r\nbrought the republic southwards towards the states of the Church and\r\nprepared the way for a prolonged struggle with the papacy.\r\n\r\nFilippo Maria had been compelled to give his daughter with the lordship\r\nof Cremona and Pontremoli to Francesco Sforza, but he dreaded and\r\ndisliked his son-in-law and schemed to effect his ruin. Sforza, however,\r\nshowed himself as adroit an intriguer as the duke. He defeated Niccolo\r\nPiccinino and his two sons, and induced Venice and Florence to renew\r\ntheir war with Milan. At the head of the army of the republics he\r\nreduced his father-in-law to such straits that he must concede all\r\ndemands. Just as he was prepared to desert his employers [Sidenote:\r\nDeath of Filippo Maria.] in order to earn the succession to Milan as his\r\nreward, the news arrived of Filippo Maria’s death (August 13, 1447).\r\n\r\nWith Filippo Maria the male line of the Visconti came [Sidenote:\r\nSuccession in Milan.] to an end. There were three possible claimants\r\nthrough females—Sforza through his wife, the duke of Orleans through his\r\nmother Valentina Visconti, and Frederick of Styria through his\r\ngrandmother Virida Visconti. But none of these claims had any legal\r\nvalidity, as the investiture by Wenzel had only recognised male\r\nsuccession. The citizens of Milan, not unnaturally, deemed that\r\ndespotism was at an end and restored a republican government. These\r\nevents excited the keenest interest in Venice. For more than twenty\r\nyears the Venetians had been engaged in almost continuous war with\r\nMilan, but since 1428 they had not gained a square yard of territory in\r\nLombardy. Foscari and his followers urged that advantage should be taken\r\nof the confusion following Visconti’s death to establish Venetian\r\nascendency, and they carried the day. It was a fatal decision from the\r\npoint of view of the policy which they advocated. If the republic of\r\nMilan had been allowed to establish itself, the result within a few\r\nyears would have been the alienation and revolt of the subject cities,\r\nand in the troubled waters Venice could have fished with great advantage\r\nto herself. But the hasty attack on the part of the Venetians forced the\r\nnewly formed republic to throw itself into the arms of the person who\r\nwas most dangerous both to Milanese independence and to Venetian\r\nambition. Francesco Sforza undertook to defend Milan against Venice, and\r\nhe showed equal promptness and ability. He destroyed the Venetian fleet\r\non the Po at Casalmaggiore and defeated their army with great loss at\r\nCaravaggio. The Venetians, having made one false step, tried to redeem\r\nit by doing still worse. They made a treaty with Sforza, by which he\r\n[Sidenote: Francesco Sforza, duke of Milan, 1450.] pledged himself to\r\nhand over to them Crema and the Ghiara d’Adda on condition that they\r\nwould not oppose his designs. The wily general now turned his victorious\r\ntroops against his employers, who were wholly unprepared to cope with\r\nsuch unexpected treachery. One city after another had to open its gates,\r\nand in 1450 Milan surrendered and acknowledged its conqueror as duke.\r\nNow the Venetians could realise the folly of their conduct. They had\r\nfound it hard enough to cope with Milan under the rule of the cowardly\r\nVisconti, but they could have no chance of extending their rule in\r\nLombardy if the duchy were allowed to pass to the first soldier of the\r\nage. They determined by a strenuous effort to overthrow Sforza before he\r\nhad securely established his authority. But they were unsuccessful in\r\nthe war which ensued, and the tragic news of the fall of Constantinople\r\ncompelled them to turn their attention from Italy to their imperilled\r\ninterests in the east. A peace was patched up with Milan at Lodi in\r\n1454. Venice resigned her recent acquisitions, and her western frontier\r\nwas restored to the same limits as in 1428.\r\n\r\nFor half a century the history of Venice had been closely bound up with\r\nthat of Milan through their mutual rivalry for territorial expansion in\r\nLombardy. With the peace of Lodi this intimate connection ceased for\r\nforty years. As long as the Sforza dynasty was secure in Milan, Venice\r\ncould not hope to do more than retain Brescia and Bergamo. And for a\r\ntime her interests in Lombardy were thrust entirely into the background\r\nby the necessity of facing the absorbing problem of Turkish advance in\r\nthe east. The policy of Foscari, so gloriously attractive in the days of\r\nCarmagnola’s early successes, had ended in disastrous failure. Men\r\nforgot the annexation of Bergamo and Brescia, and remembered only that\r\nCrema had been lost, and that while they were fighting for it\r\nConstantinople had fallen. For some time the party hostile to the doge\r\nhad found a way of attacking him through the person of his son. Jacopo\r\nFoscari had been condemned in 1445 for taking bribes and sentenced to\r\nexile. Two years later the prayers of his father obtained leave for his\r\nreturn. But in 1450 one of the judges [Sidenote: Deposition and death of\r\nFoscari.] who had imposed the original sentence was murdered. Jacopo\r\nFoscari was denounced to the Ten; and although there was no real\r\nevidence against him, and torture failed to extract a confession, he was\r\nagain exiled. Conscious of his innocence, he made strenuous efforts to\r\nescape, and was imprudent enough to correspond with the Turks and with\r\nFrancesco Sforza. On a charge of treason the exile was brought to\r\nVenice, again subjected to terrible torture, and sent back to Candia,\r\nwhere he died in 1457. These events shook the reason of the aged doge,\r\nand his neglect of his official duties induced the Ten to demand his\r\nabdication. Even the Venetians, trained by the constant fear of\r\ndenunciation to suppress their feelings, could not help murmuring as the\r\nold man descended the steps of the palace. A few days later Foscari\r\ndied, listening, it is said, to the bells which announced the election\r\nof his successor. He had served the state loyally, if mistakenly, for\r\nthirty-four years, he had raised Venice to a lofty position among the\r\npowers of Italy, and he met with the ingratitude which the instinct of\r\nself-preservation impelled the Venetian oligarchy to show towards every\r\nindividual who exercised a commanding influence on the destinies of the\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were going on at home, Venice was keenly interested\r\nin Eastern affairs. Now that Constantinople [Sidenote: Venice and the\r\nTurks.] had fallen, it was no longer possible to pursue the old policy\r\nof bolstering up the Eastern Empire as a buffer between the Turks and\r\nVenetian possessions. Two alternative courses were open to the republic.\r\nShe might take the place of Constantinople and become the bulwark of\r\nChristendom against the infidel. Or she might endeavour to secure the\r\ncontinuance of Venetian commerce in the east by making an advantageous\r\ntreaty with the conquerors. The heroic policy was advocated by Foscari,\r\nthe more cautious and selfish policy by his opponents, and the declining\r\ncredit of the doge enabled them to carry the day. In April 1454 a treaty\r\nwas concluded with Mohammed II. On payment of a yearly tribute, the\r\nVenetians were allowed to retain their ports and other possessions in\r\nthe east, and to continue their Levant trade in temporary security. A\r\ndistrict in Constantinople was assigned for the residence of Venetian\r\nmerchants under a Venetian bailiff. It was no small argument in favour\r\nof this treaty that it enabled Venice to strike another blow at her old\r\nrival Genoa. The Genoese had for some time aided the Turks in various\r\nways, and had received the promise of special trade privileges as their\r\nreward. But the Sultan found it cheaper to buy off the hostility of a\r\npossible foe than to pay the stipulated price for services already\r\nrendered.\r\n\r\nFor a few years Venice profited by the treaty of 1454, and abstained\r\nfrom giving aid to the struggling Christian populations, either of the\r\nBalkan provinces or of Greece. But the Turkish conquests were too\r\nextensive and rapid not to awaken serious misgivings. In spite of the\r\nfamous relief of Belgrad by Hunyadi, Servia was reduced, and Wallachia\r\nand Bosnia were overrun without serious resistance. Only Albania, under\r\nthe heroic Scanderbeg, succeeded by desperate efforts in prolonging its\r\nindependence, and in extorting terms from the Sultan. It was more\r\nalarming to the Venetians when the Turkish armies crossed the isthmus\r\ninto the Morea, and equipped a fleet for the conquest of Lesbos and the\r\nother islands in the Ægean. The most strenuous opponents of war had to\r\nadmit the uselessness of a paper treaty to restrain a conqueror so\r\nunscrupulous as Mohammed II. At this juncture, Pope Pius II. was making\r\nstrenuous efforts to rouse the princes of Western Europe to a crusade\r\nagainst the Turks. Venice was convinced that the further maintenance of\r\npeace was impossible; and if the pope could secure them allies in the\r\nname of religion, their prospects of success would be improved. But\r\nthese hopes of assistance were doomed to disappointment, when, in 1464,\r\nPius proceeded to Ancona to welcome and bless the crusading host. The\r\nVenetian fleet was the only efficient force which Christendom had\r\nfurnished in response to the demand of its ecclesiastical chief.\r\n\r\nThe war which Venice waged for sixteen years against overwhelming odds\r\nis by no means the least heroic episode [Sidenote: Turkish war,\r\n1463-79.] in the history of the republic. Occasionally, as when Niccolo\r\nCanale failed to save Negropont in 1470, the Venetian commanders\r\nhesitated to act with decision in the service of a state which allowed\r\nlittle freedom to its subordinates, and was apt to punish failure as if\r\nit were treason. But, on the whole, the war was waged with equal courage\r\nand conduct. It could, however, have but one result. Mohammed II.\r\nemployed all the resources of Turkish diplomacy to prevent any coalition\r\nof Italian powers, and Venice was not so popular that other states were\r\nlikely to deplore or to share her misfortunes. It is true that\r\nScanderbeg was induced to break his treaty with the Sultan, and to admit\r\nVenetian garrisons into his fortresses of Kroja and Scutari. But\r\nScanderbeg died at the beginning of 1467, leaving the guardianship of\r\nhis son and his dominions to his ally. This proved to be a fatal\r\nbequest. After the reduction of the Morea, a Turkish force entered\r\nAlbania and laid siege to Scutari. The fortress was heroically defended\r\nby Antonio Loredano, Mohammed was engaged in Asia Minor, and the siege\r\nhad to be raised. But the triumph was only temporary. In 1478 Albania\r\nwas again invaded. Kroja was taken, and Scutari, though it repulsed all\r\nattempts to storm the walls, was closely blockaded. Venice was worn out\r\nwith her prolonged and exhausting efforts, and in 1479 the peace of\r\nConstantinople brought the war to a close. Venice gave up Scutari,\r\nKroja, Negropont, Lemnos, and her possessions in the Morea, but was\r\nallowed to retain her Levant trade and her quarter in Constantinople on\r\npayment of 150,000 ducats down and a yearly tribute of 10,000 ducats.\r\nTwo years later, the death of Mohammed II. and the accession of a\r\nfeebler sultan, freed the republic from immediate danger in the east.\r\n\r\nThe disasters of the Turkish war had a demoralising effect upon Venice.\r\nIn her eastern dominions the more ambitious and enterprising of the\r\nVenetian nobles had found scope for an ability and an energy that at\r\nhome would be regarded with suspicion. These men had now to turn their\r\nattention to Italian politics, and they urged the state to seek\r\ncompensation for losses in the Levant at the expense of its neighbours.\r\nFrom this time the policy of Venice became far more openly grasping and\r\nselfish than it had ever been before, and the enmities thus provoked\r\nultimately led to the league of Cambray. Aggression in Lombardy was\r\nstill blocked by the Sforza dynasty, and it was therefore necessary to\r\nfind some weaker power to attack. A quarrel with Ferrara about the\r\nmanufacture of salt gave the desired pretext, and Venice joined with the\r\nturbulent pope Sixtus IV. in an alliance against Ercole [Sidenote: War\r\nwith Ferrara, 1482-84.] d’Este. Ferrara was powerless against such a\r\ncombination, and the Venetian forces seized Rovigo and the adjacent\r\nterritory. But an act of such unprovoked aggression excited the\r\nmisgivings of the other states; and Naples, Milan, and Florence formed a\r\nleague to maintain the balance of power against the attempts of Venice\r\nand the papacy to disturb it. Alfonso of Calabria, who enjoyed an\r\nunmerited reputation for military skill, advanced to the aid of Ferrara,\r\nSixtus deserted an ally who had obviously no regard for papal interests,\r\nand Venice was compelled to conclude the peace of Bagnolo in 1484, by\r\nwhich Rovigo was retained, but all other conquests were restored.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Venice had the good fortune to make an acquisition in\r\nthe east, which was some set-off against her losses to the Turks. The\r\nlast king of Cyprus, James of Lusignan, had married a Venetian lady,\r\nCatarina Cornaro. In order to exalt her to sufficient rank, the republic\r\nof Venice had formally adopted her as a daughter of the state. The next\r\nyear, 1473, the king died, and Venice at once interfered as paternal\r\nguardian [Sidenote: Venice acquires Cyprus.] of the widow and her\r\nposthumous child. For some years Catarina ruled under Venetian\r\nprotection and control, but in 1488 she was half induced, half compelled\r\nto abdicate, and the banner of St. Mark was hoisted in Famagusta.\r\nCatarina Cornaro was allowed to retain the title of queen, and lived in\r\nconsiderable magnificence at Asolo till the outbreak of war in 1508\r\ndrove her to seek a refuge in Venice, where she died in 1510.\r\n\r\nBut the insatiable greed of the Venetians for territory was by no means\r\nappeased by the annexation of Cyprus, which [Sidenote: Venetian greed of\r\nterritory.] could not long be retained except under tribute to the\r\nTurks. It was to Italy that the ambition of the republic was mainly\r\ndirected, and the Ferrarese war had taught her more than one lesson. If\r\nher western boundary was to be extended, the Sforzas must be driven from\r\nMilan; if territory was to be gained in the south, the triple league for\r\nthe maintenance of the balance of power must be broken up; and, above\r\nall, the house of Aragon in Naples must be punished for its action in\r\n1483, and rendered powerless for the future. How could these ends be\r\nachieved? One solution of the problem offered itself in 1493, and that\r\nwas the intervention of a foreign state. A number of Neapolitan nobles,\r\ndriven into exile by the merciless rule of Ferrante and Alfonso, came to\r\nVenice for advice as to how they might best overthrow the Aragonese\r\ndespots. The senate advised them to invite Charles VIII. of France to\r\nclaim Naples as representing the house of Anjou. The advice was taken,\r\nand the invitation was acted upon in 1494. The motives of Venice are\r\nperfectly obvious. A French invasion would weaken the house of Aragon;\r\nit would dislocate the league of the great powers; and in the\r\ndisturbance which would follow, Venice, isolated and secure herself,\r\ncould sell her assistance for the price of ports in Apulia, which would\r\ncomplete her ascendency in the Adriatic. Nor was this all. A French\r\nprince—Louis of Orleans—was a claimant to the duchy of Milan. If the\r\nFrench once entered Italy, this claim was sure to be advanced against\r\nthe Sforzas, and the dynasty, which had so long blocked any advance\r\ntowards Cremona or Milan, might be overthrown, or at any rate reduced to\r\ncomparative impotence. The reckoning was equally cold-blooded, selfish,\r\nand astute. The immediate aims were achieved. After the first successes\r\nof Charles VIII. Venice turned against France and received Otranto,\r\nBrindisi, and other ports in Apulia, as a reward for helping to restore\r\nthe Aragonese line in Naples. The duke of Orleans, on becoming Louis\r\nXII. of France, attacked Ludovico Sforza and purchased the alliance of\r\nVenice by ceding Cremona and the Ghiara d’Adda. The fall of Cæsar Borgia\r\nenabled Venice to annex a considerable part of the papal states, and\r\nthere was no Italian league to interfere. But Nemesis overtook\r\n[Sidenote: Decline of Venice.] the republic a few years later, when\r\nevery state which had been at any time despoiled, combined to attack the\r\ncommon enemy. The ruin of Venice, however, was not the work of the\r\nleague of Cambray, but of causes which she could not control. No\r\ntreaties with the Turks could keep the Levant trade as open as it had\r\nbeen, and the people on the Atlantic seaboard set to work to find an\r\nindependent route to the east. In 1486 Bartholomew Diaz rounded the\r\nCape, and in 1498 Vasco da Gama continued the voyage to India. For three\r\ncenturies and a half the Mediterranean ceased to be the great highway of\r\ncommerce, and became merely a considerable inland sea. The marvellous\r\nprosperity of Venice ceased with the conditions which had given rise to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nUntil the invasion of Charles VIII. brought Venice and Milan once more\r\ntogether, there had been little direct connection between the two states\r\nsince the treaty of Lodi gave leisure to Francesco Sforza to secure his\r\nposition [Sidenote: Francesco Sforza in Milan.] in his newly acquired\r\nduchy. In this task he was as successful as he had been in the\r\nunscrupulous methods by which he rose to power. From the first he\r\ndetermined to sink the _condottiere_ in the prince. Peace, and not war,\r\nbecame the primary object of his policy. With Cosimo de’ Medici he was\r\nalready on the most friendly terms, and as long as he or his descendants\r\nretained their power no opposition was to be feared from Florence.\r\nVenice had received a sharp lesson, and her attention was diverted to\r\nthe east. The popes had enough to do to maintain their recently\r\nrecovered authority in the papal states. The only other important state\r\nin Italy was Naples. As a military leader Sforza had played a prominent\r\npart in Neapolitan politics. He had been the champion of the house of\r\nAnjou, and when the victory ultimately rested with Alfonso of Aragon,\r\nSforza had been deprived of his estates in Apulia and the Abruzzi. But\r\nas duke of Milan, Francesco was eager to be on good terms with the king\r\nof Naples. All his interests were now opposed to the Angevin claim on\r\nNaples, which might easily be allied with the Orleanist claim to Milan.\r\nA double marriage was arranged to cement the alliance between Naples and\r\nMilan. Alfonso’s grandson, another Alfonso, was betrothed to Ippolita,\r\nSforza’s daughter, and one of Sforza’s sons was to marry Alfonso’s\r\ngranddaughter. When Alfonso’s death, in 1458, was followed by a renewed\r\nattempt of the Angevins to gain Naples, Sforza gave his cordial support\r\nto Ferrante, the natural son of the late king, and materially aided him\r\nin defending his throne.\r\n\r\nIt was extremely fortunate for Francesco Sforza that his alliance with\r\nthe house of Aragon did not lead to a serious breach with France, which\r\nhad recovered the [Sidenote: Relations with France.] suzerainty of Genoa\r\nin 1458. It was from Genoa that John of Calabria sailed to Naples in\r\n1460 to maintain the cause of his father Réné, and one of the most\r\nnotable acts of Sforza in thwarting the Angevin pretensions was his\r\nencouragement of a successful revolt of the Genoese in 1461. At this\r\ncritical moment Charles VII. of France died, and his successor, Louis\r\nXI., not only had no love for the Anjou princes, but was an avowed\r\nadmirer and imitator of Francesco Sforza. The result was a treaty in\r\n1464, by which the town of Savona and all French claims to Genoa were\r\nceded to the duke of Milan, and later in the year Sforza succeeded in\r\nsubjecting the Ligurian republic to his rule. When Louis XI. was hard\r\npressed in 1465 by the League of the Public Weal, Sforza not only sent\r\nhis eldest son with a considerable force to attack the duke of Bourbon,\r\nhe also repaid his obligations by the celebrated advice to Louis that he\r\nshould divide his enemies by conceding their demands and then reduce\r\nthem separately. French history tells how triumphantly the king followed\r\nthe counsel of his chosen model.\r\n\r\nThe government of Galeazzo Maria Sforza, who succeeded in Milan without\r\nopposition on his father’s death in March [Sidenote: Galeazzo Maria\r\nSforza, 1466-76.] 1466, was comparatively uneventful. The external\r\nrelations were maintained by Simonetta, who had been secretary to\r\nFrancesco, and remained in office under the son, on the same lines as\r\nunder the previous duke. The connection with France was drawn closer by\r\nGaleazzo’s marriage with Bona of Savoy, the sister-in-law of Louis XI.\r\nIt is true that for a moment the growing power of Charles the Bold\r\nattracted Milan to an alliance with Burgundy in 1475. But on the news of\r\nthe duke’s first reverse at the battle of Granson, Galeazzo hastened to\r\nreturn to the French alliance. The wanton cruelty of Galeazzo’s rule in\r\nMilan illustrates the demoralising effect of unbridled power upon a weak\r\nand passionate nature. To the love of bloodshed, which had characterised\r\nso many of the Visconti, he added a lustful debauchery which outraged\r\nthe honour of the noblest families of Milan. Against a lawless despotism\r\nthe only remedy is rebellion, and the revival of classical learning\r\ntended to glorify tyrannicide by parading the examples of Brutus and of\r\nHarmodius and Aristogiton. Three young nobles—Girolamo Olgiati, whose\r\nsister Galeazzo had dishonoured, Carlo Visconti, and Andrea\r\nLampugnani—determined to win eternal fame by the murder of the tyrant.\r\nSacrilege had little terrors for Italians, and Galeazzo Maria fell\r\nbeneath their daggers in the Church of St. Stephen (December 26, 1476).\r\nBut the mass of the citizens were too accustomed to subjection to\r\nespouse the cause of the rebels. Two of the assassins were slain on the\r\nspot, and Olgiati was executed after suffering horrible tortures, which\r\nhe endured with the stoicism of an ancient Roman.\r\n\r\nGaleazzo Maria Sforza left an only son, Gian Galeazzo, who was only\r\neight years old. He was immediately acknowledged as duke of Milan, under\r\nthe regency of his mother, [Sidenote: Regency of Bona of Savoy.] Bona of\r\nSavoy, but the real government rested in the hands of Simonetta. The\r\nlatter succeeded in overcoming the first difficulties that the regency\r\nencountered. A rising in Genoa was suppressed, and the brothers of the\r\nlate duke, who wished to oust their sister-in-law, were driven into\r\nexile. But in 1479 wholly unexpected problems arose. Francesco Sforza\r\nhad leant on the alliance of Florence and Naples, and as long as those\r\ntwo states were on friendly terms Simonetta pursued the same policy. The\r\nconspiracy of the Pazzi, however, involved Florence not only in a\r\nquarrel with Pope Sixtus IV., but also in a war with Naples. Bona of\r\nSavoy, under Simonetta’s guidance, clung to the Florentine alliance, and\r\nprepared to send forces to aid Lorenzo de’ Medici. Ferrante of Naples\r\ndetermined to prevent the intervention of Milan. He stirred up a new\r\nrebellion in Genoa, which succeeded in expelling the Milanese garrison\r\nfrom the citadel. At the same time, he urged the uncles of the young\r\nduke to resume their attack on the regency of Bona. Aided by divisions\r\nin the government, the brothers contrived to secure their return to\r\nMilan and to overthrow Simonetta, who was put to death at Pavia (1480).\r\nLudovico il Moro, the eldest surviving son of Francesco Sforza, now\r\nsucceeded without serious difficulty in prosecuting his schemes. The\r\nyoung duke was declared of age in order to terminate his mother’s\r\nregency, and Ludovico carried on the government in his nephew’s name.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which Ludovico had obtained his power seemed to\r\nbind him closely to Ferrante [Sidenote: Ludovico il Moro.] of Naples,\r\nwho was now reconciled with Lorenzo de’ Medici, so that the triple\r\nalliance was restored, and was able to interfere decisively in the war\r\nof Ferrara (see above, p. 257). The young Gian Galeazzo was married to\r\nIsabella, the daughter of Alfonso of Calabria, and granddaughter of\r\nFerrante. All would have been well if Ludovico’s ambition had been\r\nsatisfied with actual rule. But he was resolved to supplant his nephew\r\nin the duchy, and if necessary to get rid of him by foul means. Such a\r\nscheme was certain to meet with the determined opposition of the rulers\r\nof Naples; and Ludovico, without venturing upon an open rupture, sought\r\nfor means to protect himself from their hostility. The first sign of\r\ngrowing mistrust was visible in the war of Ferrara, when the\r\nhalf-hearted action of Ludovico allowed Venice to escape with\r\ncomparatively favourable terms in the treaty of Bagnolo. Matters became\r\nworse when Isabella of Naples openly complained to her father and\r\ngrandfather of the way in which her husband was treated by his uncle.\r\nEven more bitter was her ill-feeling when Ludovico married Beatrice\r\nd’Este, and a personal jealousy grew up between the nominal and the real\r\nduchess. Isabella was furious that she should be compelled to live in\r\npoverty and semi-captivity while her rival was the centre of a\r\nmagnificent court.\r\n\r\nThe rulers of Naples naturally espoused the cause of Isabella and her\r\nhusband, and Ludovico was conscious that an open quarrel could not be\r\nlong delayed. It was necessary for him to strengthen his position by\r\nalliances, either within Italy or without. Venice was not a power that\r\ncould be trusted to act unselfishly in support of Milan. Florence was\r\nthe oldest ally of the house of Sforza, but Lorenzo de’ Medici died in\r\n1492, and his son Piero showed a perilous inclination to prefer the\r\nNeapolitan cause to that of Ludovico. In his despair Ludovico made up\r\nhis mind to turn to France. He had already established [Sidenote:\r\nLudovico calls in the French.] a connection with France when, after\r\nreducing Genoa once more to submission to Milan, he agreed in 1490 to\r\nhold the city under the suzerainty of the French king. In 1493 he\r\ndiscovered that the Neapolitan exiles, acting on the advice of Venice,\r\nwere urging Charles VIII. to attack Naples. Ludovico sent an embassy to\r\nsupport this appeal and to promise his co-operation. He had no\r\nexpectation or desire that the French should conquer Naples, but he\r\nwished to have a French army between Milan and the southern kingdom\r\nwhile he established himself as duke in the place of his nephew. When\r\nonce France had served his purpose, he was confident of his ability to\r\nrid himself and Italy of an ally who was no longer needed. But cunning\r\nas Ludovico was, he overreached himself. It is true that Gian Galeazzo\r\ndied at the required moment, that Ludovico became duke with an imperial\r\ninvestiture, which no previous Sforza had received, and that the French\r\ninvasion prevented any opposition on the part of Naples. But among the\r\nFrenchmen who entered Italy was Louis of Orleans, who seized the\r\nopportunity to assert his claim to the duchy of Milan as the descendant\r\nof Valentina Visconti. Ludovico succeeded for the time in defeating the\r\nduke, who was not well beloved by Charles VIII. But a few years later\r\nLouis himself became king of France, and one of his first enterprises\r\nwas the expulsion of the Sforzas from Milan. Ludovico had ample time to\r\nrepent of his short-sighted policy in calling in French aid while he lay\r\na prisoner in the castle of Loches, where he died in 1510.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n          NAPLES AND THE PAPAL STATES IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Papal States during the Schism and Ladislas of Naples—Martin V.\r\n    returns to Rome—Succession question in Naples—Troubles of Eugenius\r\n    IV.—War in Naples between Réné of Anjou and Alfonso of\r\n    Aragon—Victory of Alfonso V.—Last years of Eugenius IV.—Nicolas\r\n    V.—Calixtus III.—Death of Alfonso V. of Naples—Pius II.—Congress of\r\n    Mantua—War in Naples between Ferrante and John of Calabria—Death of\r\n    Pius II. at Ancona—Paul II.—Sixtus IV. and his nephews—War with\r\n    Florence—Relations with Ferrara and Venice—Disorders in\r\n    Rome—Innocent VIII.—Rising against Ferrante in Naples—Election of\r\n    Alexander VI.—His alliance with Naples.\r\n\r\nBoniface IX. was the ablest and most successful of the Roman popes\r\nduring the Schism. The impotence into which [Sidenote: The Papal States\r\nand Ladislas of Naples.] the temporal authority of the papacy had fallen\r\nmay be judged by the fact that Boniface found it advisable or necessary\r\nto sell the vicariate, _i.e._ the right to exercise authority in the\r\nPope’s name, to the despots who had usurped lordship in the various\r\ncities. Yet this very sale, though it seemed to legalise acts of\r\nviolence and rebellion, brought with it some advantages besides filling\r\nthe Pope’s coffers. The purchase of rights was in itself an\r\nacknowledgment that the Pope possessed them, and this could be employed\r\nsome day against the purchasers. And in several ways Boniface directly\r\nincreased his power. He induced the citizens of Rome, always as greedy\r\nof papal wealth as they were jealous of papal rule, to invite him to\r\ntake up his residence in his capital on terms which ruined the\r\nfoundations of republican liberties. He aided Ladislas of Naples to gain\r\nhis final victory over Louis II. of Anjou in 1399 (_vide_ p. 155), and\r\nLadislas repaid his obligation by helping the Pope to suppress\r\nformidable risings of the Roman barons. On the death of Gian Galeazzo\r\nVisconti, he succeeded in recovering for the papacy the towns of\r\nBologna, Perugia, and Assisi, which had fallen under the sway of the\r\nduke of Milan. But Boniface bequeathed to his successors one very\r\nserious difficulty. Ladislas of Naples, who owed his crown to papal\r\nsupport, conceived the plan of extending his kingdom at the expense of\r\nthe papacy, and even of reducing the papal states under his personal\r\nrule. His first attempt to stir up rebellion in Rome, in order that he\r\nmight intervene for his own profit in the struggle, resulted in the\r\nexpulsion of Innocent VII. and the sack of the Vatican, but the citizens\r\nhastened to come to terms with the Pope when they discovered that the\r\nonly alternative to his rule was subjection to Naples (1405). Another\r\nopportunity offered itself in 1407, when Gregory XII. left Rome in order\r\nto simulate willingness to confer with Benedict XIII. for the closing of\r\nthe schism. Ladislas had no wish that the schism should end, not only\r\nbecause its continuance facilitated his schemes of aggression, but also\r\nbecause it strengthened his position in Naples. The movement for union\r\nhad its chief strength in France, and any successful intervention of\r\nFrance in Italy would lead to a new attempt to gain Naples for the\r\nyounger house of Anjou. In 1408 Ladislas seized Rome, and practically\r\nmade himself master of the papal states. But to some extent his plan\r\nmiscarried. Gregory XII., it is true, pleaded events in Rome as a reason\r\nfor avoiding a conference, but his cardinals deserted him and joined\r\nwith those of Benedict to hold a council at Pisa (_vide_ p. 199). The\r\nattempt of Ladislas to disperse the Council by invading Tuscany was\r\nfoiled by the resistance of Florence, and the Assembly proceeded to\r\ndepose the two existing popes and to elect Alexander V. Baldassare\r\nCossa, the papal legate in Bologna, who combined the training and habits\r\nof a _condottiere_ with the office of cardinal, undertook the task of\r\nrecovering Rome and of punishing the prince who still adhered to the\r\ncause of Gregory XII. Rome was captured at the beginning of 1410, but\r\nAlexander V. died in May, and the all-powerful Cossa was elected to\r\nsucceed him as John XXIII. The new pope entered Rome in triumph in 1411,\r\nand his first act was to despatch a powerful army under Braccio, Sforza,\r\nand other famous generals, to support the cause of Louis of Anjou in\r\nNaples. A great victory was won at Rocca-Secca (May 19, 1411), but the\r\ndelay of the conquerors enabled Ladislas to rally his forces, and before\r\nlong to gain the upper hand. Louis II. abandoned the enterprise in\r\ndespair. Attendolo Sforza deserted to the side of the Neapolitan king,\r\nand John XXIII. made peace with his enemy in 1412, the one abandoning\r\nthe cause of Gregory XII., the other promising to disown the duke of\r\nAnjou. But Ladislas had no intention of observing the peace. As soon as\r\nhis preparations were completed, he again marched upon Rome in 1413, and\r\ndrove John XXIII. in hasty and undignified flight to Florence. This\r\ncrushing disaster forced the Pope into those appeals for aid to\r\nSigismund, which ultimately led to the summons of the Council of\r\nConstance and to his own ignominious deposition. But in August 1414,\r\nbefore the Council had begun its session, Ladislas died, leaving his\r\ncrown to his sister, Joanna II., and the scheme of subjecting the papal\r\nstates to Naples perished with him. The citizens of Rome expelled Sforza\r\nand his troops from the city, and welcomed the return of a papal legate.\r\n\r\nWhen unity was at last restored to the Church by the election of Martin\r\nV., the new Pope had a very cheerless prospect [Sidenote: Martin V.,\r\n1417-1431.] before him. His obvious task was to restore to the papacy\r\nsome measure of the authority and influence which had been forfeited by\r\nits experiences during the last hundred years. To do this he must find a\r\nresidence in which he would be more secure than his recent predecessors\r\nfrom the dictation of secular rulers. Sigismund urged him to reside in\r\nsome German city, and the French would have welcomed him to Avignon. But\r\nMartin, himself a Roman by birth, refused to find a home except in the\r\nancient capital of the world. Rightly or wrongly, he decided that\r\ntemporal dominion in a state of his own was necessary to secure the\r\nindependence of the Pope, and that to attain this he must recover and\r\nconsolidate the papal provinces in Italy. The whole history of the\r\npapacy during the fifteenth century was moulded by this decision. The\r\npopes became more and more absorbed in the extension of their temporal\r\npower, even when their spiritual authority was weakened by it. Nepotism\r\nand other evils were the result of this devotion to secular interests,\r\nand a revolt of outraged and alienated opinion became inevitable.\r\n\r\nBut Martin had many difficulties to overcome before he could carry out\r\nhis intention of taking up his abode in Rome. [Sidenote: Martin returns\r\nto Rome.] The departure of John XXIII. to Constance had left the papal\r\nstates in the condition of anarchy which had become chronic. Neapolitan\r\ninfluence was still strong, but the policy of Naples was no longer\r\ndirected by the strong will of Ladislas. His sister and successor,\r\nJoanna II., was devoid of political capacity, and abandoned herself to\r\nsensual indulgence and the guidance of favourites. Through her\r\nincompetence the chief influence over the destinies of Naples was\r\nallowed to fall into the hands of the two great _condottieri_, Braccio\r\nda Montone and Attendolo Sforza, who had been brought into rivalry by\r\ntheir connection with Neapolitan affairs during the previous reign.\r\nBraccio, who had quarrelled with Ladislas, and joined John XXIII., had\r\nbeen left by that Pope as governor of Bologna. After the departure of\r\nhis employer he seized his native city of Perugia and set himself to\r\ncarve a private principality out of the states of the Church. In 1417 he\r\nactually made himself master of Rome, and was besieging the castle of\r\nSt. Angelo, when Sforza was despatched from Naples to compel his\r\nretirement. These events forced Martin V. on his accession to ally\r\nhimself with Joanna and Sforza, and a treaty was arranged in 1419 by\r\nwhich Naples was to restore all that had been occupied in the papal\r\nstates. But a quarrel between Joanna and Sforza deprived this treaty of\r\nall importance, and Martin determined to coerce and distract Naples by\r\nencouraging internal feuds in that kingdom. As Joanna was childless, the\r\nquestion of the succession to a crown [Sidenote: Succession question in\r\nNaples.] which had already been so hotly disputed was certain to give\r\nrise to difficulties. Louis II. of Anjou, the rival of Ladislas, had\r\ndied in 1417; but his eldest son, Louis III., was eager to enforce his\r\nfather’s claim and to purchase the support of the papacy. Martin V. and\r\nSforza declared their recognition of Louis as heir to the kingdom. But\r\nJoanna, indignant at this attempt to force a successor upon her, turned\r\nto a family whose rivalry with her own dynasty was older than that of\r\nthe younger house of Anjou. Alfonso of Aragon had become king of Sicily\r\nin 1409, and was not likely to refuse the prospect of a notable increase\r\nof his power in the Mediterranean by the acquisition of Naples. He\r\neagerly accepted the offer of Joanna to adopt him as her heir, and he\r\ninduced Braccio to enter his service in order to oppose Sforza. Thus\r\ncivil war was kindled in Naples, and its outbreak gave the Pope the\r\nopportunity for which he had been waiting. Leaving Florence, where he\r\nhad resided since his departure from Constance, he made his way to Rome\r\nin September 1420. There he set himself to put an [Sidenote: Rule of\r\nMartin V.] end to disorders and to strengthen the foundations of papal\r\nrule. The exhaustion of the combatants in Naples, and the successive\r\ndeaths of Braccio and Sforza in 1424, freed him from the danger of any\r\nintervention from the south. Alfonso abandoned the contest for a time,\r\nand Joanna agreed to recognise the claim of Louis of Anjou to be\r\nregarded as her successor. Perugia and the other territories of Braccio\r\nreturned on his death to their allegiance to the Pope. In Rome itself\r\nMartin had one source of strength in the support of his own family of\r\nColonna, though their advancement to places of dignity and importance\r\nwas certain to create difficulties for his successor. Once secure in his\r\ntemporal dominions, the Pope was free to turn his attention to the\r\ngeneral affairs of the Church. The first council which he was bound to\r\nsummon by the decrees of Constance met at Siena, and was adroitly\r\nmanaged so as to avoid any further limitation of papal authority. By\r\nputting himself at the head of the movement to crush the Hussites, and\r\nby appointing a papal legate to lead the armies against the heretics,\r\nMartin tried to recover for the papacy the position which it had enjoyed\r\nin the time of the great crusades of the Middle Ages. But the crusading\r\nspirit was dead in Europe, and the successive victories of the Bohemians\r\nnot only frustrated his designs, but also compelled him to summon a\r\nCouncil to meet at Basel shortly before his own death on February 20,\r\n1431.\r\n\r\nEugenius IV., who was unanimously elected to succeed Martin V., had a\r\ntroubled pontificate of sixteen years. He [Sidenote: Troubles of\r\nEugenius IV.] at once set himself to deprive the Colonna family of the\r\npredominance which they had acquired in Rome through the favour of his\r\npredecessor; but he could only accomplish this by an alliance with the\r\nOrsini, and he thus revived the old feuds among the Roman barons which\r\nit was the interest and the duty of the popes to check. Very soon after\r\nhis accession he engaged in a bitter quarrel with the Council of Basel,\r\nand he completely failed in his endeavour to detach Sigismund from the\r\ncause of the Council as the price of conferring the imperial crown upon\r\nthat prince. To make matters worse, he allowed his sympathies with his\r\nnative city of Venice to involve him in a quarrel with Filippo Maria\r\nVisconti of Milan. In 1433 the climax of his misfortunes seemed to be\r\nreached, when a combination of Milanese hostility with domestic\r\ndiscontent drove him to fly in disguise from Rome, and to seek refuge in\r\nFlorence. These accumulated disasters compelled him to adopt a humbler\r\ntone towards the Council of Basel, which was conducting negotiations\r\nwith the Bohemians as if its authority completely superseded that of the\r\nPope.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the succession dispute in Naples gave rise to a\r\nprolonged war. Louis III. of Anjou died in 1434, but [Sidenote: War of\r\nAngevins and Aragonese in Naples.] Joanna made a new will in favour of\r\nhis younger brother Réné of Provence. Soon afterwards the queen herself\r\ndied, on February 2, 1435. Alfonso V. at once came forward to assert his\r\nown claims against those of Réné, and the Neapolitan baronage was\r\ndivided into the factions of Anjou and Aragon. It was impossible for the\r\npapacy to remain neutral in a struggle which so intimately concerned its\r\nown interests. Eugenius began by claiming the kingdom as a fief which\r\nhad lapsed to its suzerain on the extinction of the line of papal\r\nvassals. But he soon dropped this claim and reverted to the normal\r\npolicy of supporting the Angevin candidate. At first, events seemed to\r\nturn decisively in favour of Réné. A Genoese fleet, fighting on his\r\nside, won a great naval victory off the island of Ponza, in which\r\nAlfonso himself was taken prisoner. But in a personal interview with\r\nFilippo Maria Visconti, who claimed the captive by virtue of his\r\nsuzerainty over Genoa, Alfonso convinced him that it would be impolitic\r\neither to strengthen the papacy which was allied with Venice, or to\r\nestablish French influence in Southern Italy. By these arguments he not\r\nonly secured his own release, but also laid the foundations of a durable\r\nalliance between his own dynasty and the dukes of Milan. From this time\r\nthe fortunes of war turned steadily in favour of the Aragonese party,\r\nthough it was not till 1442 that Réné finally abandoned the contest, and\r\nAlfonso V. was formally recognised as king of Naples. His accession\r\nreunited for a time the crowns of Naples and Sicily, which had been\r\nseparated since the Sicilian Vespers in 1282 (see p. 25).\r\n\r\nSo far Eugenius had met with little but failure and disappointment. He\r\ngained an apparent victory over the Council of Basel when he induced the\r\nGreeks to conduct the negotiations for a union of eastern and western\r\nchurches at a rival council which met first at Ferrara, [Sidenote: Later\r\nyears of Eugenius IV.] and later in Florence. But the treaty which was\r\nsettled at the Council was repudiated by public opinion in Greece, and\r\nthe Pope gained little real advantage from the parade of negotiations\r\nwhich proved abortive. Yet the later years of his pontificate were more\r\nsuccessful than seemed likely from the beginning. Rome did not long\r\nenjoy the republican liberty which the citizens claimed to have\r\nrecovered on the Pope’s departure. The warlike Cardinal Vitelleschi\r\nsucceeded by 1435 in reducing the capital to submission. So successful\r\nwere the rigorous and cruel measures of the legate that Eugenius\r\nsuspected him of a design to establish his own power in the papal\r\nstates. In 1440 Vitelleschi was imprisoned and died, either from poison\r\nor from the wounds he received in the struggle with his captors.\r\nScarampo, who took his place, maintained his authority by the same means\r\nas his predecessor had employed. In 1443 Eugenius was able to quit\r\nFlorence and to return to Rome in perfect security. He gained the\r\nalliance of Naples by recognising the title of Alfonso V. But his\r\ngreatest triumph was the inauguration of the negotiations with Germany,\r\nthrough the medium of Æneas Sylvius Piccolomini, which led to the\r\nfailure and humiliation of the Council of Basel. The final treaty was\r\npractically concluded, though still unsigned, when Eugenius died, on\r\nFebruary 23, 1447.\r\n\r\nThomas of Sarzana, who succeeded to the papacy as Nicolas V., had\r\nalready won a considerable reputation as a [Sidenote: Nicolas V.,\r\n1447-1455.] student of ancient literature. Though he was rather a\r\ndiligent collector of manuscripts and works of art than an original\r\nscholar, his patronage made Rome for a time the centre of humanist\r\nculture. His greatest work was the foundation of the Vatican library. As\r\na politician Nicolas showed less ability and interest than as a student,\r\nbut he was a sincere lover of peace, and he was able to maintain the\r\nposition which Eugenius had won in his later years. He concluded the\r\nconcordat with Germany, which put an end to the revolt originating with\r\nthe Council of Basel, and the Council itself came to an ignominious end\r\nin 1449. In 1450 Nicolas celebrated the restoration of unity, and\r\nconciliated the Roman people, by a grand jubilee which brought the\r\nwealth of Europe to the eternal city. In spite of this general\r\nrejoicing, the next year witnessed a famous conspiracy against the\r\nsecular authority of the Pope. Stefano Porcaro was a Roman noble who had\r\nwon the favour of Nicolas by his devotion to ancient literature. But\r\nthese studies led Porcaro, as they had previously led Rienzi, to an\r\nenthusiastic admiration of republican liberty. When he endeavoured to\r\ninspire the people with his opinions he was banished by the Pope to\r\nBologna. Thence he returned secretly to Rome and organised a plot to\r\nimprison the Pope and cardinals, and to restore the republic, with\r\nPorcaro as tribune. More than four hundred persons were engaged in the\r\nscheme, and the number proved fatal to secrecy. Porcaro and nine of his\r\nfollowers were imprisoned in the castle of St. Angelo and executed\r\nwithout trial. After an interval of a few days harsh measures were\r\nresumed, and a number of suspected persons shared the same fate. This\r\nseverity extinguished the last active desire to restore Roman liberty.\r\nPapal rule was strengthened by the failure of the plot; but Porcaro’s\r\nname, like that of Rienzi, lived long in the affections of the people.\r\nNo sooner was this crisis passed than the news came that Constantinople\r\nhad been taken by Mohammed II. in 1453. The empire had long ceased to\r\npossess any general authority in Europe, but the papacy still claimed to\r\nrepresent that unity of Christendom, whose disappearance had rendered\r\nsuch a catastrophe possible. It was upon the papacy, therefore, that the\r\nchief discredit fell of so notable a triumph for the infidel. But\r\nNicolas V. had no ability to cope with such a vast problem as was\r\ninvolved in the union of the jarring interests of European states for\r\nthe purpose of joint resistance to the Turks. Unable to devise any\r\npractical scheme, he gave himself up to despair, lamented that fate had\r\nraised him from a private station, and died in 1455.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Nicolas V. the choice of the cardinals fell upon\r\nAlfonso Borgia, who took the name of Calixtus III. [Sidenote: Calixtus\r\nIII., 1455-1458.] He was a native of the Aragonese province of Valencia,\r\nand had been rewarded with the cardinalate for services rendered to the\r\npapacy in negotiations with Alfonso V. Although over seventy years of\r\nage, Calixtus showed creditable energy in urging the princes of Europe\r\nto war against the Turks, and he had the consolation of hearing of the\r\nsignal victory of John Hunyadi, when Mohammed II. was repulsed from the\r\nwalls of Belgrad in 1456. But the pontificate of Calixtus is mainly\r\nnoteworthy for the elevation of a relative who was destined to involve\r\nthe papacy in the gravest scandals. Nepotism was a natural result of the\r\nsecular aims of the fifteenth century popes. As long as the popes had\r\nbeen the active heads of Christendom their energies were fully employed\r\nin carrying out a great task. But they were now little more than\r\ntemporal princes, and their position differed from that of other princes\r\nin the impossibility of transmitting their power to a dynasty, and in\r\nthe brief period of rule which was possible for men elected in advanced\r\nyears. Hence there was a serious temptation to the popes to aggrandise\r\ntheir relatives at the expense of the Church or of neighbouring princes,\r\nand thus to confer those advantages upon their family which a secular\r\nprince could bring about by the normal action of hereditary succession.\r\nCalixtus had three nephews, the sons of a sister and a man called\r\nLenzuoli. These young men were allowed to take the maternal name of\r\nBorgia, and their interests were vigorously forwarded by their uncle.\r\nTwo were appointed cardinals, to the great scandal of the College and of\r\nRoman opinion; and one of these, Rodrigo Borgia, became the notorious\r\nPope Alexander VI. The third nephew received the title of duke of\r\nSpoleto, and the offices of Gonfalonier of the Church and prefect of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nBefore the death of Calixtus important events had taken place in Naples.\r\nAlfonso V., after the prolonged war which secured him the throne, had\r\nenjoyed a singularly peaceful reign. The personal charm which had\r\nenabled him to gain over Filippo Maria Visconti also served to win the\r\naffection of his subjects; and his court was rendered famous not only by\r\nits magnificence, but also by the eminence of the scholars who were\r\nattracted to Naples by royal patronage. But Alfonso’s death, in June\r\n1458, threatened a revival of dynastic struggles in southern Italy. As\r\nhe had no lawful issue, his hereditary kingdoms of Aragon and Sicily\r\npassed to his brother, John II. But Alfonso claimed the right to dispose\r\nof Naples as a private acquisition of his own, and bequeathed the\r\nkingdom to his illegitimate son, Ferrante. The Neapolitans themselves\r\nwere not at first inclined to resent an arrangement which freed them\r\nfrom a connection with Aragon and Sicily which might be regarded as\r\nsubjection. But it was obvious that the accession of a bastard would\r\nencourage the house of Anjou to revive its claim, while the legitimate\r\nline in Aragon could always assert the same right to Naples which had\r\nbeen vindicated by Alfonso himself. It was therefore of great importance\r\nto Ferrante to obtain recognition from the Pope, who claimed to be\r\nsuzerain of Naples, and he had some right to demand it with confidence\r\nfrom Calixtus, who was born a subject of Aragon. But the Pope, whether\r\nhe remembered the traditional Angevin alliance of the papacy, or whether\r\nhe sought in the spoils of Naples for new means of advancing his\r\nnephews, refused to recognise Ferrante, and claimed to dispose of the\r\nkingdom as a vacant papal fief. Before, however, he could make any\r\nefficient opposition to the new king, he was removed by death on August\r\n6, 1458.\r\n\r\nThe choice of the cardinals now fell upon the most remarkable Pope of\r\nthe century, Æneas Sylvius Piccolomini, who adopted the Virgilian\r\nepithet of Pius as his papal [Sidenote: Pius II., 1458-64.] name. In his\r\nyouth Æneas Sylvius had lived a gay and not too decorous life. The\r\nauthor of the novel of _Euryalus and Lucretia_, and the confidant of the\r\namours of princes, he had first achieved political distinction at the\r\nCouncil of Basel. There his literary and oratorical ability had given\r\nhim a position of recognised eminence; but when the cause of the Council\r\nbegan to decline, he had entered the service of Frederick III., and had\r\nplayed by far the most prominent part in effecting a reconciliation\r\nbetween Germany and the papacy. For these services he had been rewarded\r\nby Nicolas V. with the bishopric of Siena, his native city, and by\r\nCalixtus III. with the cardinal’s hat. Raised to the papacy, he set\r\nhimself to destroy the last traces of conciliar opposition to Roman\r\nsupremacy, and with this object in view he strained every nerve to put\r\nhimself at the head of a great crusading movement against the Turks. His\r\ncareer is full of strange contradictions, and the contrast has often\r\nbeen drawn between his unscrupulous youth and early manhood and the\r\naustere enthusiasm which he displayed as Pope. He himself was fully\r\nsensible of the incongruity, and in his famous recantation he urged his\r\nhearers to cast away Æneas and take Pius in his place: _Æneam rejicite,\r\nPium accipite_.\r\n\r\nAs peace was absolutely necessary for any action against the Turks, the\r\nfirst act of Pius was to reverse the policy of his predecessor, and to\r\nrecognise Ferrante as _de facto_ king of Naples, though he was careful\r\nto avoid any formal decision on the question of legal right. In 1459 he\r\nsummoned a congress of Western princes to meet at [Sidenote: Congress of\r\nMantua.] Mantua, in the confident hope that his eloquence would prove as\r\neffective as that of Peter the Hermit in the eleventh century. On the\r\nappointed date the Pope and his personal followers found themselves\r\nalone in Mantua. After a month’s anxious delay, some ambassadors and a\r\nfew German and Italian princes appeared, and the Congress was declared\r\nopen. But the Pope soon discovered that his hopes had been far too\r\nsanguine; and after much eloquence had been expended in invectives\r\nagainst the Turks, the Congress broke up without achieving anything.\r\nThere is no need to seek far for the causes of the failure of the\r\nMantuan Congress. The growth of nations, with separate and often\r\nconflicting interests of their own, had destroyed all the conditions\r\nwhich had rendered possible the crusades of the Middle Ages. There were\r\nalso special causes at the time which rendered it difficult for Pius II.\r\nto gain any real support for his schemes. The French were angry with the\r\nPope for having prejudiced the Angevin claims to Naples by his\r\nrecognition of Ferrante. Pius replied to the remonstrances of the French\r\nenvoys by attacking the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges; and though he\r\nmight claim a dialectical victory, such discussions were not conducive\r\nto a good understanding with France. Even Frederick III., the old patron\r\nof Æneas Sylvius, was at this time dissatisfied with the Pope for\r\nrefusing to support his claims to the Hungarian crown, which had gone to\r\nthe son of John Hunyadi, Mathias Corvinus. In Germany there were still\r\ntraces of that spirit of opposition to the papacy which had been both a\r\ncause and a result of the conciliar movement; and Pius II. chose this\r\nmoment to exasperate the German princes who shared these opinions by\r\nissuing from Mantua the bull _Execrabilis_, by which he condemned as\r\ndetestable heresy any future appeal from the bishop of Rome to a general\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nJust at this very time there broke out the war in Naples, which the Pope\r\nhad endeavoured to avert. The Neapolitan [Sidenote: War in Naples.]\r\nbarons revolted against the harsh rule of Ferrante, and appealed for aid\r\nto the house of Anjou. Réné le Bon was unwilling to quit his luxurious\r\nlife in Provence; but his son John, titular duke of Calabria, was at\r\nonce more capable and more ambitious. From Genoa, which was at this time\r\nunder French suzerainty, John sailed to the Neapolitan coast, and was\r\nspeedily joined by a large number of partisans. Hostilities in Naples\r\nwere fatal to the crusading schemes of Pius II. In spite of his desire\r\nto avoid a quarrel with France, he could not withdraw his support from\r\nFerrante, and he was further attached to the Aragonese cause by the\r\ninfluence of Francesco Sforza, who feared that an Angevin triumph in the\r\nsouth might encourage the duke of Orleans to advance a claim to Milan.\r\nBut in spite of the aid of the Pope and of Sforza, the cause of Ferrante\r\ndid not at first prosper. John gained an important victory at Sarno on\r\nJuly 7, 1460; and his general, Jacopo Piccinino, also succeeded in\r\ndefeating the Aragonese forces. But in the next year there was a very\r\ndecided turn of fortune. The death of Charles VII. gave the French\r\nthrone to Louis XI., who was ill disposed towards his Angevin relatives,\r\nwhile he was a warm admirer of Francesco Sforza. Genoa had already\r\nrepudiated the French control, and before long Louis agreed to transfer\r\nhis claims over Genoa to the duke of Milan. Thus John of Calabria, who\r\nhad brought with him few men and little money, was deprived of the\r\nprospect of aid from France. His Neapolitan supporters began to desert\r\nhim after his first reverse in 1462, and in 1464 John was compelled to\r\nabandon the enterprise as hopeless and return to France. His brief but\r\nadventurous career is full of incident. He sought to punish Louis XI.\r\nfor his desertion by joining the League of the Public Weal. When that\r\nwar was over, he carried on his quarrel with the house of Aragon by\r\njoining the Catalans in their revolt against John II. In that quarrel he\r\nmet his death in 1469. Four years later his only son, Nicolas, also\r\ndied, and the male descendants of Réné of Provence came to an end. The\r\nhouse of Anjou was now represented only by Réné himself; by his\r\ndaughters, Yolande and Margaret, who had married respectively Frederick\r\nof Vaudemont and Henry VI. of England; and by his brother’s son, Charles\r\nof Maine. Of the two daughters, Margaret had lost her only son, Edward,\r\nat Tewkesbury in 1471; but Yolande had a son, called Réné after his\r\ngrandfather, who was engaged in defending the duchy of Lorraine against\r\nthe attacks of Charles the Bold of Burgundy. When the old Réné died in\r\n1480, he disinherited this grandson, who was then his only descendant,\r\nin favour of his nephew Charles of Maine, with the further provision\r\nthat on the extinction of the latter’s line the inheritance should pass\r\nto the French crown. In the next year Charles of Maine died without\r\nchildren, and by virtue of this will Provence and Bar were seized by\r\nLouis XI. At a later date Charles VIII. was induced to found upon his\r\nsuccession to the house of Anjou a claim to the crown of Naples, which\r\ninaugurated a new epoch, not only in the relations between France and\r\nItaly, but also in the international politics of Europe.\r\n\r\nDuring the war in Naples Pius II. had despaired of a crusade, and with\r\ncharacteristic ingenuity and self-confidence he devised a new scheme for\r\nsecuring the victory of the cross over the crescent. The eloquence which\r\nhad failed to arouse the princes of Europe might prove more successful\r\nwith their heathen opponent. He drew up and despatched a lengthy epistle\r\nto Mohammed II., urging him to become a Christian, and promising on that\r\ncondition to confirm him in possession of the eastern empire, as his\r\npredecessors had given the empire of the west to Charles the Great. As\r\nfar as we know the Sultan returned no answer to this unique proposal.\r\nBut the pacification of Naples by the victory of Ferrante, and the\r\ngrowing uneasiness of Venice at the continuance of Turkish aggression in\r\nGreece and the Archipelago, encouraged the Pope to resume his more\r\nwarlike plans. In 1463 he concluded an alliance with the Venetians and\r\nMathias Corvinus of Hungary. He renewed his exhortations to a general\r\ncrusade, and declared his intention of leading it in person. In 1464 he\r\nwent to Ancona, which had been fixed for the meeting of the crusading\r\nforces. Again the aged Pope met with a bitter disappointment. The only\r\ncrusaders at Ancona were a few adventurers who had nothing to lose, and\r\nhoped to make their profit out of the papal treasures. At last, on\r\nAugust 12, the Venetian fleet approached the harbour, and Pius was\r\ncarried to the window to witness its entry. This effort was [Sidenote:\r\nDeath of Pius II. at Ancona.] his last, and two days later he died,\r\nstraining his eyes eastward, and with his last breath urging the\r\nprosecution of the crusade. The poignant contrasts of his career were\r\nconspicuous to the last. Æneas Sylvius, careless, light-hearted, and\r\nuntroubled by moral scruples, had faithfully represented the new epoch\r\nin which he lived. Pius II., enthusiastic, gloomy, and passionate, seems\r\nto be the ghost risen from the Middle Ages, which were dead.\r\n\r\nThe pontificate of Paul II. was short and comparatively uneventful. He\r\nbelonged to the Venetian family of the [Sidenote: Paul II., 1464-71.]\r\nBarbi, and his election seemed likely to cement that alliance between\r\nthe papacy and the maritime republic on which Pius II. had ultimately\r\nrelied for resistance to the Turkish advance. But Paul acquiesced\r\nwithout much protest in the failure of his predecessor’s plans; and by\r\nurging Hungary into war with the heretical George Podiebrad of Bohemia,\r\nhe rendered impossible even a league of eastern princes against the\r\ninfidel. Paul’s name is also associated with a so-called persecution of\r\nthe humanists, because he imprisoned some members of the Roman academy\r\nwho had talked vaguely and irresponsibly of a restoration of the\r\nrepublic. But it is absurd to treat a simple measure of internal police\r\nas evidence of a definite and far-reaching policy, or as marking a\r\nreaction from the patronage of letters by Nicolas V. The whole episode\r\nhas attracted more attention than it deserves through the interested\r\nemphasis of the chronicler, Platina, who has exaggerated both his own\r\nsufferings and his own importance. Paul II. was a true Pope of the\r\nRenaissance, looking at affairs from an intellectual rather than from a\r\nspiritual point of view, and exulting both in his own handsome figure,\r\nwhich led him to desire the name of Formosus, and in the beauty of the\r\njewels and carvings of which he was an industrious and intelligent\r\ncollector. But he was free from the grosser vices and crimes which have\r\ngiven notoriety to his successors.\r\n\r\nThe name of Sixtus IV. might well have been handed down to posterity as\r\ntypifying the extreme degradation in which the [Sidenote: Nepotism of\r\nSixtus IV.] papacy was involved in this century by its absorption in\r\ntemporal interests, but that the bolder and more picturesque crimes of\r\nCæsar Borgia have secured that pre-eminence for the pontificate of\r\nAlexander VI. The aims and actions of Sixtus were those of a secular\r\nprince, and display that cynical disregard of moral considerations which\r\nhas been portrayed as the characteristic of the age in the pages of\r\nMachiavelli. No previous Pope had ventured to show so reckless a\r\ndetermination to use his office for the advancement of his relatives,\r\nand to employ his relatives as a means of strengthening the temporal\r\npower of the papacy. Three of his nephews were the sons of his brother,\r\nRaffaelle della Rovere. The eldest, Lionardo, was made prefect of Rome,\r\nand was married to a natural daughter of Ferrante of Naples. Giuliano\r\ndella Rovere, the most capable and vigorous of the family, was raised by\r\nhis uncle to be cardinal of San Pietro ad Vincula. After playing a\r\nprominent part as the opponent of the two succeeding popes, he gained\r\nthe tiara himself as Julius II. The third son, Giovanni, succeeded\r\nLionardo as prefect of Rome, and Sixtus obtained for him the hand of\r\nJoanna, daughter of Federigo da Montefeltro, duke of Urbino, a marriage\r\nwhich in the next generation gave the duchy to a della Rovere dynasty.\r\nBut the Pope’s most lavish favours were conferred upon the two sons of a\r\nsister, Piero and Girolamo Riario. Piero was made a cardinal at the age\r\nof twenty-five, and received so many preferments, including the\r\narchbishopric of Florence, that he drew a princely revenue from the\r\nChurch. He only lived three years after his uncle’s accession, but\r\nduring that time he succeeded in startling Europe by the stories of the\r\nextraordinary pomp and debauchery on which he squandered his wealth. The\r\npromotion of Girolamo Riario, a layman, was effected within the papal\r\nstates, and had more lasting results. The papal treasure was employed to\r\npurchase for him the lordship of Imola; he was married to Caterina, a\r\nnatural daughter of Galeazzo Maria Sforza, and on the extinction of the\r\nOrdelaffi in 1480 his uncle’s support gained for him the city of Forli\r\nwith the title of duke. The whole policy of the Pope was directed for\r\nyears to the aggrandisement of a youth who proved no more worthy of his\r\nelevation than his brother had been. In 1488 the people of Forli rose\r\nand murdered him, and only the heroism of his widow secured for a time\r\nthe continuance of his dynasty.\r\n\r\nThe obvious intention of the Pope to extend his temporal power and to\r\nabuse it for the aggrandisement of his nephew excited the misgivings of\r\nthe neighbouring states, and especially of Florence, which was at this\r\ntime under the guidance of Lorenzo de’ Medici. In order to remove this\r\nobstacle from their way, Sixtus and Riario organised the famous\r\nconspiracy of the Pazzi for the overthrow of the Medici rule. The Pope\r\nasserted his ignorance of any scheme of assassination, but he must have\r\nknown that success could hardly be achieved without bloodshed, and his\r\ndenial of complicity was a merely formal attempt to save the credit of\r\nthe holy see. The plot very narrowly missed its aim: Giuliano de’ Medici\r\nwas killed in the cathedral of Florence, but Lorenzo escaped with a\r\nsevere wound, and the chief conspirators, including the archbishop of\r\nPisa, fell victims to the popular fury. Enraged at the failure of his\r\nscheme, Sixtus excommunicated the Florentines for laying violent hands\r\nupon a dignitary of the Church, and formed a league with Ferrante of\r\nNaples for the overthrow of the republic. The disorder in Milan\r\nfollowing the death of [Sidenote: War with Florence.] Galeazzo Maria\r\nSforza, and the fact that Venice was still engaged in the Turkish war,\r\ndeprived Florence of her natural allies, and in 1479 the city was\r\nexposed to serious peril. Lorenzo de’ Medici, however, not only averted\r\nthe danger, but dexterously employed it to strengthen his authority. At\r\nconsiderable personal risk, he undertook a journey to Naples, and\r\nsucceeded in negotiating a peace with Ferrante. Sixtus was at first\r\ninclined to continue the war; but the occupation of Otranto by a Turkish\r\nforce in 1480 constituted such a serious menace to Italy, that the\r\nobstinate Pope was forced to come to terms with his opponents and to\r\nwithdraw the bull of excommunication against Florence.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish invasion compelled Ferrante of Naples and his son Alfonso to\r\nwithdraw their troops from Tuscany, and [Sidenote: Relations with\r\nFerrara and Venice, 1482-84.] to concentrate their attention on the\r\nrecovery of Otranto. Fortunately for Italy, the death of Mohammed II. on\r\nMay 3, 1481, and a dispute as to the Turkish succession, led to the\r\nwithdrawal of the invaders, and enabled the Neapolitan rulers to claim a\r\nmilitary triumph which they had done little or nothing to bring about.\r\nBut the alliance between Naples and the papacy had been completely\r\nannulled, and Sixtus, as restless as ever, did not scruple to form a new\r\ncoalition, which was destined to have momentous results to Italy. Venice\r\nhad concluded the treaty of Constantinople with the Turks in 1479, and\r\nwas eager to obtain upon Italian soil compensation for its losses in the\r\neast. Hence arose in 1482 an unscrupulous and unprecedented alliance\r\nbetween the papacy and Venice for the spoliation of Ercole d’Este of\r\nFerrara. The danger to the balance of power in Italy led to the\r\nformation of a hostile coalition between Naples, Florence, and Milan.\r\nSixtus IV. soon discovered that he had gained nothing by his change of\r\nallies. Venice had seized the district of Rovigo from Ferrara, but had\r\nobviously no intention of handing over any share of the spoils to\r\nGirolamo Riario. At the same time, Neapolitan troops entered the papal\r\nstates and threatened Rome, and there was a risk that the misdeeds of\r\nthe papacy might result in the meeting of another general council. The\r\nPope, whose policy was entirely selfish, did not hesitate to avert the\r\ndanger by a sudden and complete change of front. In 1483 he made peace\r\nwith Naples and Ferrara, excommunicated the Venetians for disturbing the\r\npeace of Italy, and prepared to seize the cities which Venice had\r\nacquired within the papal dominions. But his restless greed was again\r\ndoomed to disappointment. Venice adroitly ended the war by the treaty of\r\nBagnolo, in which the only loser was the unfortunate duke of Ferrara,\r\nand Sixtus was chagrined to find that he had gained absolutely nothing\r\nby his ill-faith. Soon afterwards he died on August 12, 1484, and\r\ncontemporary lampoons declared that he died of peace.\r\n\r\n                 ‘Nulla vis potuit sævum extinguere Sixtum:\r\n                   Audito tantum nomine pacis, obit.’\r\n\r\nIn Rome itself the pontificate of Sixtus IV. had been as turbulent as\r\nhis foreign relations. The great families, and especially the Colonnas,\r\nhad opposed the advancement of the Pope’s nephews, and had thus drawn on\r\nthemselves the wrath of Sixtus. A long civil war ensued, [Sidenote:\r\nDisorders in Rome.] in which the barons allied themselves with the\r\nforeign enemies of the Pope, at one time with Florence, at another with\r\nNaples or with Venice. In this war Sixtus displayed all his cold-blooded\r\ncruelty and treachery. The stronghold of his enemies was the castle of\r\nMarino, which was surrendered by Lorenzo Colonna on condition that he\r\nshould be restored to his family. Sixtus fulfilled his promise by\r\nsending them his corpse. The mother appeared at the papal court, and\r\nproducing her son’s head, exclaimed, ‘See how a Pope keeps faith!’ It\r\nwas a graphic picture of the terrible degradation of Rome by the Pope’s\r\nabandonment of spiritual aims for temporal ambition. Directly the Pope’s\r\ndeath was known, the Colonnas headed a rising which sacked the palaces\r\nof the Riarios and drove their adherents from Rome.\r\n\r\nThe character of Innocent VIII. has been painted by some historians in\r\nblacker colours than it deserves. It is true that [Sidenote: Innocent\r\nVIII., 1484-92.] he was the first Pope who recognised his own children,\r\nbut they seem to have been born before he took orders, and his devotion\r\nto them did not involve him in such scandals as disgrace his predecessor\r\nand his successor. The principality of Anguillara was purchased for his\r\nson, Franceschetto Cibo, but the latter was more interested in gaining\r\nmoney than power, and his first act after his father’s death was to sell\r\nhis territories to Virginio Orsino. Innocent himself had little capacity\r\nand little interest in politics. He spent great part of his time in a\r\nstate of lethargy, which not infrequently gave the appearance of death.\r\nAmong those who exercised a dominant influence over the feeble Pope was\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici, who married his daughter Maddalena to Franceschetto\r\nCibo, and as a part of the bargain, obtained the cardinal’s hat for his\r\nsecond son, Giovanni, at the age of fourteen. It was under Innocent\r\nVIII. that the Medici obtained that position at the papal court which\r\nenabled them to produce two almost successive popes, Leo X. and Clement\r\nVII., and enabled these popes to use the power of the Church to suppress\r\nthe liberties of their native city.\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest difficulty of Innocent VIII.’s pontificate was\r\nconnected with Naples. Ever since the withdrawal of [Sidenote: Rising of\r\nNeapolitan barons.] John of Calabria in 1464, the bastard house of\r\nAragon had enjoyed undisputed possession of the Neapolitan throne.\r\nJacopo Piccinino, the _condottiere_, who had been formidable in the\r\nprevious struggle, was enticed to Naples by Ferrante with the aid of\r\nFrancesco Sforza, and was treacherously put to death in 1465. At the\r\ntime of his alliance with Sixtus IV. against Lorenzo de’ Medici,\r\nFerrante had succeeded in reducing his tribute to his papal suzerain to\r\nthe annual gift of a white horse. The freedom from external danger\r\nenabled the king to make the royal authority despotic, and to annul the\r\nindependence of the feudal nobles. His son, Alfonso of Calabria, gained\r\nan undeserved military reputation by the withdrawal of the Turks from\r\nOtranto, and from that time was associated with his father in the\r\ngovernment. Under his influence the royal rule became even more\r\ntyrannical and oppressive, and in 1485 the barons determined to rebel.\r\nInnocent VIII., who desired to extort the old tribute from Naples which\r\nhis predecessor had commuted, espoused their cause, and Venice, always\r\nhostile to the house of Aragon, gave secret assistance. It was decided\r\nto revive the Angevin pretensions, and Réné of Lorraine, the grandson of\r\nRéné le Bon, was invited to come to Italy as a claimant of the crown for\r\nwhich his ancestors had so long contended. But the rebellion ended in\r\ncomplete failure. Neither Florence nor Milan would consent to such a\r\ndisturbance of the normal relations of Italy as would be involved in\r\nFrench intervention. The military force of the Neapolitan rulers was\r\noverwhelming, and Alfonso, for the second time, led an army against\r\nRome. To complete the disasters of the Pope and his allies, Réné of\r\nLorraine, who was engaged in prosecuting a hopeless claim upon Provence\r\nat the French court, allowed the opportunity of gaining Naples to slip\r\nfrom his hands. But the mere threat of a French invasion was enough to\r\ninduce Ferrante and Alfonso to come to terms. The Pope was bought off by\r\nthe restoration of the former tribute, and the Neapolitan barons,\r\ndeprived of all hope of assistance, submitted on the understanding that\r\na full amnesty should be granted to them. The promise was broken with\r\nthat cynical disregard of good faith which marked the politics of Italy\r\nin the fifteenth century. The nobles who returned to Naples were\r\nimprisoned, and were never again seen alive. The sole survivors were\r\nthose who preferred to remain in exile rather than trust the rulers whom\r\nthey had endeavoured to depose. These men eagerly watched for an\r\nopportunity which might enable them at once to avenge the death of their\r\nassociates and to regain their own confiscated territories. In 1493 they\r\nwere at last enabled to act. The death of Lorenzo de’ Medici, and the\r\ngrowing alienation of Ludovico Sforza from Naples, removed some of the\r\nchief securities for peace in Italy. By the advice of Venice the\r\nNeapolitan exiles petitioned for the intervention, not of the duke of\r\nLorraine, but of the French king, Charles VIII. Before any final\r\ndecision had been come to at the French court, Ferrante had died on\r\nJanuary 25, 1494, and Alfonso II. was left to face the danger of which\r\nhis own violence and misrule had been the principal cause.\r\n\r\nInnocent VIII. had not lived to witness this new crisis in the history\r\nof Naples. His death in 1492 had been followed by a very important\r\nelection. The most prominent candidates for the suffrages of the\r\nconclave were Ascanio Sforza, the brother of Ludovico, and Giuliano\r\ndella Rovere, the nephew of Sixtus IV. But neither could obtain the\r\nrequisite majority, and in the end Ascanio Sforza was bribed to support\r\nthe candidature of the wealthiest of the Roman cardinals, Rodrigo\r\nBorgia, a nephew of Calixtus III. The well-known fact that he had\r\nseveral natural children, born to him not only since he was a priest,\r\nbut since he had been a cardinal, seems to have been completely\r\ndisregarded. [Sidenote: Election of Alexander VI.] A lavish expenditure\r\nof money and promises secured his election, and he assumed the title of\r\nAlexander VI. The first great problem which the new Pope had to solve\r\nconcerned the approaching struggle in Naples. In spite of his\r\nobligations to Ascanio Sforza, and his antagonism to the Orsini, who\r\nwere closely connected at this time with the house of Aragon, Alexander\r\nallowed himself to be drawn in 1493 into an alliance with Ferrante, and\r\non his death he recognised the title of Alfonso II. The French invasion,\r\nwhich the Pope was thus pledged to resist, threatened the papacy for\r\nsome time with serious dangers; but in the end it proved one of the\r\nchief circumstances which enabled Alexander himself, and afterwards\r\nJulius II., to erect the temporal power upon firmer foundations than any\r\nof their predecessors had been able to construct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n                       FLORENCE UNDER THE MEDICI\r\n\r\n\r\n    The period of oligarchical rule in Florence—Maso and Rinaldo degli\r\n    Albizzi—Niccolo da Uzzano—The opposition and Giovanni de’ Medici—War\r\n    with Filippo Maria Visconti—The _Catasto_—Unsuccessful attack upon\r\n    Lucca—Expulsion of the Medici—Fall of the Albizzi, and return of\r\n    Cosimo de’ Medici—Character and methods of Cosimo’s rule—Luca Pitti\r\n    and the _coup d’état_ of 1458—Cosimo’s foreign policy—Piero de’\r\n    Medici and his opponents—Victory of Piero—Accession of Lorenzo de’\r\n    Medici—Approximation to monarchy—Alienation of Naples, and quarrel\r\n    with Sixtus IV.—Conspiracy of the Pazzi—War in 1478 and 1479—Lorenzo\r\n    goes to Naples—Conclusion of peace—Constitutional changes in\r\n    1480—Lorenzo’s later years—Importance of his death—Reckless conduct\r\n    of the younger Piero.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the Florentine democracy paid a heavy penalty for their\r\nmomentary triumph in 1378. A violent [Sidenote: Oligarchical rule in\r\nFlorence.] reaction in 1382 restored the oligarchy under the leadership\r\nof the Albizzi, and for the next fifty years the curious machinery of\r\nthe civic constitution was carefully manipulated to secure the\r\nascendency of the dominant faction. Although it is by no means the most\r\nfamous, there can be no doubt that this is one of the most successful\r\nperiods in Florentine history. Under the resolute guidance of a close\r\noligarchy, Florence maintained a heroic struggle against the\r\nencroachments of Gian Galeazzo Visconti until his death in 1402 saved\r\nthe city from almost inevitable submission. When the Milanese dominions\r\nfell to pieces, Florence seized the opportunity to gain a great prize;\r\nand the city of Pisa, which commanded the mouth of the Arno, was in 1406\r\ncompelled to surrender after an obstinate resistance (see p. 244). Then\r\nfollowed a long war with Ladislas of Naples, in the course of which\r\nFlorence acquired the important town of Cortona. And in 1421 the\r\ncommercial interests of the city were strengthened by the purchase from\r\nGenoa of a second port—Livorno.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the active leader of the victorious faction and the most\r\ninfluential politician in Florence was Maso degli Albizzi, a nephew of\r\nthe Piero degli Albizzi who had been so prominent in the party strife of\r\nthe fourteenth century (see p. 164). Maso had returned from exile in\r\n1382, and at various times held most of the chief offices of the state.\r\nWhile he was gonfalonier in 1393 harsh measures were taken to complete\r\nthe defeat of the democrats. But, apart from the severity shown to the\r\nunfortunate Alberti and their supporters, Maso showed himself a wise and\r\ntolerant ruler. When he died in 1417, his place was, to some extent,\r\ntaken by his eldest son, Rinaldo, who displayed great industry and\r\nintegrity, but less prudence and insight than his father. The almost\r\nhereditary prominence of these two men did much to accustom the\r\nFlorentines to that disguised despotism which was afterwards established\r\nby the Medici. But the Albizzi never enjoyed such undivided ascendency\r\nas was held by Cosimo and Lorenzo de’ Medici. At least as influential a\r\nleader as Rinaldo was Niccolo da Uzzano, who is frequently spoken of by\r\ncontemporaries as the head of the party. He seems to have been a sincere\r\nenthusiast for aristocratic rule, and it was greatly due to his\r\ninfluence that the Albizzi were prevented from making themselves\r\nabsolute masters of the city. His reputation for wisdom and insight was\r\ndeservedly high, and his death in 1432 proved a fatal blow to the party\r\nin whose counsels he had always been on the side of moderation.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the services which it rendered to the state, the\r\noligarchical government did not succeed in averting discontent and\r\nhostility. The strongest political sentiment among the Florentines was\r\nthe love of equality, which found practical expression in the system of\r\nfilling offices by lot. This love of equality was more outraged by the\r\ndomination of a clique of ruling families than it would have been by the\r\ngovernment of a single despot. The lesser guilds and the lower classes\r\nresented their virtual exclusion from office; and many wealthy citizens,\r\nwho had incurred the displeasure of the dominant faction, found\r\nthemselves equally left in the cold. Moreover, the militant foreign\r\npolicy of the government was extremely expensive; and the burden of\r\ntaxation, as was always the case in Florence, fell more heavily upon the\r\nopponents than upon the supporters of the government. Gradually the\r\ncause of the opposition came to be more and more identified with the\r\nhouse of Medici. The action of Salvestro de’ Medici in 1378 had\r\nidentified the name with the popular cause, though he did not personally\r\nprofit by its short-lived victory. In 1393, when the severe measures of\r\nMaso degli Albizzi provoked a popular rising, it was to Vieri de’\r\nMedici, a kinsman of Salvestro, that the mob appealed for guidance, and\r\nit was his moderate advice which checked the rebellion. But it was a\r\nmember of another branch of the family—Giovanni de’ Medici—who, in the\r\nsecond decade of the fifteenth century, came to be regarded as the\r\nleader of those who disapproved of the conduct of affairs by the ruling\r\nparty. Giovanni was a banker and money-changer, and was so successful in\r\nhis business that he became the richest citizen in Florence, if not in\r\nItaly. He employed his wealth in extending his popularity, though he was\r\nextremely careful to avoid any action which might give the government a\r\nhandle against him. In 1421 he was drawn as gonfalonier, and Niccolo da\r\nUzzano wished to cancel the appointment as dangerous. But Giovanni’s\r\nhold on the people, and especially on the lesser guilds, made such a\r\nstep perilous, and his two months of office passed uneventfully.\r\nGiovanni de’ Medici died in 1429, leaving two sons—Cosimo, afterwards\r\nthe ruler of Florence, and Lorenzo, whose descendants in the sixteenth\r\ncentury became grand-dukes of Tuscany.\r\n\r\nAs long as the oligarchical government was successful, there was little\r\nprospect of its overthrow, but from 1421 its credit steadily declined.\r\nThe reunion of the [Sidenote: War with Filippo Maria Visconti.] Milanese\r\nterritories under Filippo Maria Visconti constituted a serious menace to\r\nFlorence, and the imperative duty of self-defence compelled the republic\r\nto embark once more in a desperate struggle for existence. In 1424 the\r\nFlorentine army, under Pandolfo Malatesta, was defeated with great loss\r\nin the battle of Zagonara. A despairing appeal was made to Venice for\r\nassistance, and the intervention of Carmagnola saved Florence from\r\nannihilation. But the spoils of victory were monopolised by Venice, and\r\nthe aggrandisement of their ally was by no means popular with the\r\nFlorentines. The power of the oligarchy had rested upon the success of\r\ntheir foreign policy, and alarming discontent was the inevitable result\r\nof an unsuccessful war. Two important measures were resorted to in the\r\nhope of restoring the prestige of the dominant faction. The heavy\r\nexpenses of the war had called attention to the old grievance of\r\narbitrary taxation, and in 1427 a reform was introduced to provide a\r\nmore [Sidenote: The Catasto of 1427.] equitable basis of assessment.\r\nAccording to Machiavelli, the acceptance of the _Catasto_, as it was\r\ncalled, was due to the influence of Giovanni de’ Medici. Every citizen\r\nwas to report to the gonfalonier of his district his whole income from\r\nevery source; and concealment was to be punished by confiscation. From\r\nfixed capital the income was to be estimated at seven per cent. These\r\nreports were to be collected into four books, one for each quarter of\r\nthe city; and henceforth the assessment of taxation was to be determined\r\nby them instead of depending upon a man’s political position and\r\nopinions. As wealth fluctuated rapidly in a mercantile community, a new\r\n_catasto_ was to be made every three years. It was a notable sacrifice\r\non the part of the ruling clique, and probably tended to weaken their\r\nunanimity, but it helped to pacify public opinion for a time. Rinaldo\r\ndegli Albizzi now came forward with a new scheme for restoring the\r\ncredit of his party. Ever since the days of [Sidenote: Attack upon\r\nLucca, 1430.] Castruccio Castracani, the annexation of Lucca had been a\r\ndarling object of Florentine ambition. Lucca was, at this time, ruled by\r\none of its own citizens—Paolo Guinigi—who had sided with Milan in the\r\nrecent war. Rinaldo proposed to treat this as a pretext for attacking\r\nLucca. It was in vain that Niccolo da Uzzano pointed out the risks of\r\nthe enterprise. Giovanni de’ Medici was dead, and his son Cosimo\r\nsupported the proposal of Rinaldo. His conduct on this occasion has\r\nexposed him to the suspicion that he foresaw the failure of the\r\nenterprise, and was willing to ruin his opponent even at the expense of\r\nthe state. War was declared in 1430, and Rinaldo degli Albizzi was\r\nappointed one of the commissioners to superintend the siege of Lucca.\r\nThe enterprise was as unsuccessful as it was unjust, and its failure was\r\nultimately fatal to the party in power. Rinaldo, unjustly accused of\r\npeculation, threw up his command in disgust. The duke of Milan was drawn\r\ninto the war, and the two most famous _condottieri_ of the day—Francesco\r\nSforza and Niccolo Piccinino—were employed in his service. After\r\nsuffering serious reverses in the field, the Florentines were glad to\r\naccept the mediation of the emperor Sigismund, and in 1433 peace was\r\nmade, leaving things as they were before the war.\r\n\r\nBut no treaty could restore the previous conditions within the city.\r\nNiccolo da Uzzano had died in 1432, and his death [Sidenote: Expulsion\r\nof the Medici, 1433.] deprived his party of their strongest support,\r\nwhile it removed the moderating influence on their conduct. Cosimo de’\r\nMedici was at once more ambitious and less cautious than his father, and\r\nhe and Rinaldo degli Albizzi were now avowed rivals for ascendency. The\r\nlatter, conscious of his growing weakness, determined to have recourse\r\nto violence. In September 1433, when the signoria was composed of\r\nRinaldo’s adherents, Cosimo de’ Medici was summoned to appear before the\r\nmagistrates, and was imprisoned while his fate was deliberated upon. For\r\nsome time it was generally expected that he would be put to death. But\r\nthe wealth which his father had collected stood him in good stead, and\r\nhis judges were not proof against corruption. The majority decided for a\r\nmilder sentence. Cosimo was banished for ten years to Padua, and his\r\nbrother Lorenzo for five years to Venice. Most of their prominent\r\nadherents shared their exile, and the Medici were declared incapable of\r\nholding any office in Florence.\r\n\r\nThe victory of Albizzi seemed to be assured when Cosimo went into exile\r\nin October 1433. The ordinary machinery of a Florentine _coup d’état_\r\nhad been set in motion. The people had been convened in the piazza, and\r\nhad approved the appointment of a _balia_ or revolutionary committee.\r\nBut by a strange oversight on the part of so experienced a partisan,\r\nRinaldo had failed to obtain for this committee the right of refilling\r\nthe bags with the names of candidates for office. The result was that\r\nthe weakness of his position was only slightly modified. His own party\r\nwas divided and inclined to be mutinous because the _catasto_ was not\r\nabolished. And the alienation of public opinion by military failures\r\ncould only be removed by some conspicuous success. In 1434 Florence\r\nbecame involved in a war in Romagna between Filippo Maria Visconti and\r\nthe Pope. Again her troops were defeated in the field, and her ally,\r\nEugenius IV., driven from Rome by the Colonnas, was forced to seek a\r\nrefuge within her walls. In this moment of depression the accident of\r\nlot resulted in the formation of a signoria in September 1434, which was\r\nfavourable to the Medici. Rinaldo [Sidenote: Recall of the Medici,\r\n1434.] in his turn was summoned before a hostile magistracy, and he came\r\naccompanied by eight hundred armed men. But he lost the favourable\r\nopportunity for overawing his opponents by consenting to an interview\r\nwith Eugenius IV., who had offered his mediation. This delay proved\r\nfatal. The _popolo minuto_ took up arms and surrounded the piazza; while\r\nthe signoria called in armed peasants from the country. The parliament\r\ncreated a _balia_ in the interests of the party, which had for the\r\nmoment the upper hand. The Medici and Alberti families were recalled and\r\ndeclared eligible for office. Rinaldo degli Albizzi with his son and\r\nabout seventy partisans were banished from Florence, and few of them\r\never returned to their native city. Cosimo de’ Medici, who was in Venice\r\nwhen the news of this sudden revolution reached him, re-entered Florence\r\non October 6, 1434. For the next three centuries the history of Florence\r\nis bound up with the history of the house of Medici.\r\n\r\nThe ascendency which the dramatic events of 1433 and 1434 gave to Cosimo\r\nde’ Medici was not only retained [Sidenote: Character of Medicean Rule.]\r\nduring his life, but became for a time a hereditary possession. Yet it\r\nis impossible to point to any great apparent change in the constitution.\r\nThe old magistracies and councils continued to exist and to fulfil their\r\nformer functions. Cosimo was extremely careful to avoid any outward\r\nsigns of despotism. He continued to live in his former residence; and\r\nnothing in his dress or his manner of life distinguished him from his\r\nfellow-citizens. Like his defeated rival, he surrounded himself with a\r\nsort of body-guard of allied families, whose interests he skilfully\r\nidentified with his own. To all appearance this was as much an oligarchy\r\nas the government which it had displaced. The difference is to be found\r\nin two points. On the one hand Cosimo was enabled, partly by his wealth,\r\nand partly by his extensive foreign connections, to exercise a far\r\nstronger control over his adherents and over the state than either Maso\r\nor Rinaldo degli Albizzi had ever been able to wield. And, on the other\r\nhand, the influential families who rose to power under Cosimo did not\r\nrepresent the domination of a class as the rule of the Albizzi had done.\r\nThe Medici never forgot that they owed their original rise to their\r\nchampionship of democratic equality; and they were careful to avoid any\r\nunnecessary collision with the prejudices of the mob. Even a disguised\r\ndespotism must aim at the obliteration of classes, and this can be\r\nclearly traced in the policy of Cosimo. He transferred several families\r\nfrom the lesser to the greater guilds, and thus obscured a distinction\r\nwhich had been at one time of supereminent importance. And he even\r\nprocured the repeal of the disqualifications against the old nobility on\r\nwhich the foundations of the historic municipality had been built.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to trace the methods by which Cosimo maintained the\r\npower which had fallen into his hands. He had two primary objects to\r\nattain: he must prevent [Sidenote: Methods of Cosimo’s Government.] the\r\nmore important offices from falling into the hands of malcontents, and\r\nhe must diminish their number by bringing home to them the hardships and\r\ndangers of opposition and the rewards that were to be gained by loyalty.\r\nCosimo boasted of the humanity of his rule, and he was always careful to\r\nintrust to his followers the initiation of harsh proposals. But his\r\npolicy was really one of proscription. The Albizzi and their allies were\r\ntreated with the greatest severity. Not only were they banished, but\r\ntheir place of exile was constantly changed, and they were hunted about\r\nItaly like wild beasts. It was no wonder that their patriotism gave way\r\nto a desire for revenge, and they joined the duke of Milan against their\r\nnative city. But the battle of Anghiari in 1440 destroyed all hope of\r\nsuccess, while their treason gave a pretext for more merciless\r\ntreatment. The financial administration was employed to the same ends.\r\nThe _catasto_ of 1427 was abolished, and the system of arbitrary\r\nassessment was revived. This enabled Cosimo to reward his adherents and\r\nto punish malcontents. Giannozzo Mannetti, a harmless student, whose\r\nonly offence was his popularity, was called upon to pay taxes to the\r\namount of 135,000 florins, and could only avoid ruin by going into\r\nvoluntary exile. It was a common saying that Cosimo employed the taxes,\r\nas northern princes used the dagger, to rid himself of his opponents.\r\n\r\nFor the regulation of offices Cosimo employed the revolutionary\r\nmachinery which was in theory the ultimate enforcement of popular\r\nsovereignty. The _balia_ which had recalled the Medici in 1434 had\r\nreceived from the parliament full power to reform the state. Every five\r\nyears this power was renewed—in 1439, 1444, 1449, and 1454. The most\r\nimportant act of the _balia_ was the appointment of ten _accoppiatori_\r\nto superintend the filling of the bags with the names of those who were\r\neligible for office. This was in itself a fairly ample assurance that no\r\nopposition to the Medici could be anticipated from the magistracy; and\r\nto make it doubly sure, the names of the gonfalonier and priors were\r\nselected every two months by the _accoppiatori_. They were made, as the\r\nphrase went, not by lot, but by hand. But as time went on, this\r\nprolonged departure from normal procedure gave rise to grumbling; and as\r\nthere were good reasons for avoiding at the moment any appearance of\r\ndisunion in the city, Cosimo determined to yield. In 1455 the _balia_,\r\nwhich had been renewed the year before, was abolished, and the practice\r\nof drawing the names of the signoria was revived. The concession was\r\nmore apparent than real; for the bags had only recently been refilled,\r\nand three years would elapse before a new _squittinio_ would be\r\nnecessary. For that time the ascendency of the Medici party was secure,\r\nand before it had elapsed measures might be taken to prolong it. But\r\nthat the revival of liberty was of some moment is proved by the proposal\r\nin the signoria of January 1458 to restore the _catasto_. Cosimo’s\r\npartisans urged him to employ energetic measures to defeat a scheme\r\nwhich attacked their own pockets. But he was not unwilling to teach them\r\nhow dependent they were upon his support, and he allowed the system of\r\nstrict and impartial assessment to be revived.\r\n\r\nThere was one very obvious danger to which such a government as that of\r\nCosimo de’ Medici was exposed. Jealousy and ill-will might arise among\r\nhis intimate associates. It was his deliberate policy to place them in\r\nprominent positions, and they were perforce intrusted with the secrets\r\nof his administration. One or more of them might seek to use their\r\nexperience for their own advancement and to free themselves from the\r\ncontrol of their patron. This danger was partially realised in Cosimo’s\r\nlater years, and serious difficulties arose from the same source in the\r\ntime of his son. In 1458 it had become a grave question how far the\r\nrevival of republican freedom should be allowed to go. The death of\r\nAlfonso of Naples removed one great motive for continuing the\r\nconciliatory policy of the last three years; and the appointment to the\r\ngonfaloniership of Luca Pitti, one of the oldest and closest of Cosimo’s\r\nadherents, gave the opportunity for decisive action. After careful\r\nprecautions had been taken to control the avenues to the piazza and to\r\nimpress the mob, a parliament was convened by the ringing the great bell\r\nof the Palazzo Publico. A _balia_ [Sidenote: Coup d’état of 1458.] of\r\n350 citizens, together with the existing signoria, was endowed with full\r\nauthority. _Accoppiatori_ were appointed to fill the bags, and a\r\npermanent committee, the _Otto di Balia_, received the control of the\r\ncivic police. By a curious irony it was announced to the people that the\r\npriors should henceforth be called, not _priori delle arti_, but _priori\r\ndella Liberta_. The name was chosen, says Machiavelli, to designate what\r\nhad been lost.\r\n\r\nBut in this revolution to confirm the previous revolution Cosimo had\r\ncarefully abstained from taking any active share. In the eyes of the mob\r\nthe victorious politician [Sidenote: Luca Pitti.] was Luca Pitti, who\r\nseemed to himself, as to others, to overshadow his employer. Puffed up\r\nwith ambition, he began to build the magnificent palace on the southern\r\nside of the Arno, which, afterwards the residence of the grand-dukes of\r\nTuscany, and now the shrine of one of the greatest picture galleries in\r\nthe world, has done more than any political achievement to preserve to\r\nposterity the name of its founder. Cosimo was probably convinced that\r\nlittle real danger was to be dreaded from Luca Pitti, and he made no\r\nattempt to alter or correct the popular impression. As long as his\r\ninfluence was really unimpaired he cared little who had the appearance\r\nand pomp of supremacy.\r\n\r\nAs a great banker, Cosimo de’ Medici was an important personage in many\r\nforeign courts, quite apart from his [Sidenote: Cosimo’s Foreign\r\nPolicy.] political position in Florence. With very notable dexterity he\r\nplayed his two parts so as to make each improve the other. He employed\r\nhis financial relations to strengthen his hold upon the strings of\r\nFlorentine policy, and he utilised his political influence to increase\r\nhis business and his profits. It is in foreign affairs far more than in\r\ndomestic administration that he showed himself to be the real ruler of\r\nFlorence. He inherited from the Albizzi a struggle against Filippo Maria\r\nVisconti and an alliance with Venice. As long as the duke of Milan\r\nthreatened the independence of Florence, and especially when he espoused\r\nthe cause of the exiled Albizzi, Cosimo could not safely depart from the\r\ntraditional policy of Florence. But the death of Filippo Maria in 1447\r\nand the establishment of a republic in Milan gave him more scope for\r\noriginality. He had to choose between the aggrandisement of Venice in\r\nLombardy, which must have been the inevitable result of the maintenance\r\nof the Milanese republic, and the erection of a military power in Milan\r\nwhich should hold Venice in check. Without any hesitation he decided for\r\nthe latter alternative, and the later history of Italy was vitally\r\ninfluenced by his choice. The financial and other aid which he received\r\nfrom Florence was one of the most potent factors in enabling Francesco\r\nSforza to obtain the lordship of Milan in 1450, and to conclude the\r\ntreaty of Lodi with Venice in 1454.\r\n\r\nAnother hardly less momentous question for Italy arose after the death\r\nof Alfonso V. of Naples, when in 1460 the Angevin claim was revived in\r\nantagonism to Ferrante. Although Florence was closely allied with France\r\nby her Guelf traditions and her commercial interests, Cosimo was\r\nresolute in his support of Ferrante and in urging Francesco Sforza to do\r\nthe same. Again his attitude helped to turn the scale in a struggle\r\nwhere, for a time, the balance was undecided. He just lived to hear of\r\nthe retirement of John of Calabria, which secured the bastard house of\r\nAragon from serious attack for the next thirty years. By his action in\r\nthese two great crises Cosimo must be regarded as the real author of\r\nthat triple alliance between Naples, Milan, and Florence, of which his\r\ngrandson in later years made such a masterly use.\r\n\r\nCosimo’s death in 1464 left the headship of the family to his only\r\nsurviving son, Piero, who was already middle-aged [Sidenote: Piero de’\r\nMedici and his opponents.] and in feeble health. The five years during\r\nwhich he survived his father are chiefly noteworthy because they\r\nwitnessed the great split in the Medicean party, which careful observers\r\nmust have seen for some time to be inevitable. Four of the most\r\nprominent associates of Cosimo—Luca Pitti, Diotisalvi Neroni, Angelo\r\nAcciaiuoli, and Niccolo Soderini—were unwilling to give to the son the\r\ndeference which they had shown to the father. Luckily for the Medici,\r\ntheir unanimity did not go far. The first three were actuated by motives\r\nof personal ambition, which might easily lead them to quarrel with each\r\nother, while Niccolo Soderini was an enthusiast for democracy, and had\r\nno desire to humble Piero in order to exalt another in his place. Neroni\r\nwas the ablest of the leaders, but he was lacking in personal courage,\r\nand preferred to employ intrigue and constitutional methods rather than\r\nviolence. It was only gradually that two parties were organised in\r\navowed opposition to each other. The anti-Medicean party received the\r\nnickname of the Mountain, because the great palace of Luca Pitti was\r\nrising on the hill of San Giorgio. The residence of the Medici stood on\r\nlevel ground to the north of the Arno, and hence Piero’s adherents were\r\nknown as the Plain.\r\n\r\nThe first trial of strength took place in 1465, when the opposition made\r\na bid for popularity by proposing to abolish the _balia_ of 1458 and to\r\nrestore the constitutional method of filling offices by lot. Piero was\r\ntoo cautious to oppose such a measure, and it was carried with virtual\r\nunanimity. In November the first draw took place, and Niccolo Soderini\r\nbecame gonfalonier. Disunion among the leaders prevented any use being\r\nmade of the advantage which chance had given them, and Soderini went out\r\nof office at the end of December without having effected any further\r\nchange in the constitution. In the next year the party strife was\r\nextended to foreign politics. Venice had never forgotten or forgiven the\r\npart which Florence had played in establishing the Sforzas in Milan. Now\r\nthat Francesco was dead and succeeded by the more reckless Galeazzo\r\nMaria, there was some possibility of evicting a dynasty which was a\r\nperpetual bar to Venetian expansion in Lombardy. But to overthrow the\r\nSforzas it was first necessary to overthrow the Medici. And so the\r\nleaders of the Mountain made overtures to Venice, regardless of the\r\nconsideration that a complete reversal of foreign policy might damage\r\nthe interests of Florence. The Venetians were too cautious to commit\r\nthemselves to an alliance with a faction which might fail, and moreover\r\nthey had the Turkish war on their hands. But there was a secret\r\nunderstanding that if Piero de’ Medici were got rid of, either by the\r\ndagger or by a revolution, his opponents would be aided by troops under\r\nBartolommeo Coleone, a _condottiere_ in the pay of Venice, and Ercole\r\nd’Este, brother of the duke of Ferrara.\r\n\r\nPiero knew enough of these schemes to induce him to draw closer the\r\nalliance with Milan and Naples which his [Sidenote: Crisis of 1466.]\r\nfather had bequeathed to him. His elder son, Lorenzo, received his first\r\nexperience of diplomacy by being sent on an embassy to Ferrante. The\r\nnews that Ercole d’Este had advanced in the direction of Pistoia brought\r\nmatters to a crisis. Piero hurried to Florence from his villa at\r\nCareggi, and is said to have escaped an ambush on the way through the\r\nvigilance and acuteness of Lorenzo. Galeazzo Maria Sforza was invited to\r\nsend troops to the assistance of Florence, and the peasants from the\r\nMedici estates were armed and brought into the city. On the other side\r\nNiccolo Soderini collected two hundred men who were kept in arms in the\r\nPitti palace. Civil war seemed inevitable, but by a tacit agreement\r\nactive violence was postponed till the new signoria was drawn at the end\r\nof August. Fortune or skill favoured the Medici, and a gonfalonier and\r\npriors devoted to their interests took up office on September 1. On the\r\nnext day the great bell called the people to a parliament in the piazza.\r\nThe armed adherents of Piero commanded every entrance, and the\r\ndissentients who obtained admission were too few or too timid to make\r\nthemselves heard. A numerous _balia_ was proposed by the signoria and\r\napproved by acclamation. For the next ten years the priors were to be\r\nmade by hand. Neroni, Acciaiuolo, and Niccolo Soderini were banished.\r\nLuca Pitti, who had been bribed or persuaded to desert his associates,\r\nwas allowed to remain, but his ostentation had made him unpopular, and\r\nhe spent the rest of his life in harmless insignificance. His gigantic\r\npalace remained unfinished till it was completed by the Medici in the\r\nnext century.\r\n\r\nThere still remained the danger of foreign intervention. Neroni, who had\r\nbeen banished to Sicily, defied the decree and repaired to Venice. It\r\nwas decided to carry [Sidenote: Failure of the anti-Mediceans.] out the\r\nscheme which had been arranged in the previous year. Bartolommeo Coleone\r\nwas to conduct in the interest of the exiles what was ostensibly a\r\nprivate enterprise. He was joined in the spring of 1467 by Ercole d’Este\r\nand several of the smaller princes of Romagna. Neapolitan and Milanese\r\nauxiliaries were sent to the aid of Florence, whose forces were under\r\nthe supreme command of Federigo da Montefeltro, duke of Urbino. Italy\r\nwatched with eager interest the progress of the campaign, which was\r\nconducted with the punctilious precision so dear to the professional\r\nsoldier of Italy. There was a great deal of marching, but very little\r\nfighting and very little execution. The armies never came anywhere near\r\nFlorence, whose fate was supposed to be at stake, and no decisive\r\nadvantage was gained by either side. But this was in itself decisive\r\nenough. It was sufficient for the Medici to avoid defeat; the exiles\r\ncould hope for nothing unless they gained a great victory. In 1468 peace\r\nwas negotiated by Pope Paul II., leaving matters _in statu quo_. The\r\nexiles lost all hope of returning to Florence. Niccolo Soderini died in\r\nGermany in 1474; Neroni lived in Rome till 1482; Angelo Acciaiuoli\r\nentered a Carthusian monastery in Naples.\r\n\r\nThe struggle of 1466 and 1467 removed any possible doubt as to the\r\nposition of the Medici. The whole aim of the opposition and their\r\nsupporters had been to effect their overthrow, and the attempt had\r\nfailed. They were undistinguished by any title, but they were as\r\nobviously the rulers of Florence as if they called themselves dukes or\r\ncounts. This was made clear after the death of Piero de’ Medici on\r\nDecember 3, 1469. Tommaso Soderini, Niccolo’s brother, who had remained\r\nfaithful during the recent crisis, convened a _pratica_ or [Sidenote:\r\nAccession of Lorenzo.] informal meeting of the principal citizens. He\r\nproposed that Lorenzo de’ Medici, who was only twenty-one, and therefore\r\nbelow the legal age for holding any magistracy in the republic, should\r\nbe invited to exercise the power that had been wielded by Cosimo and\r\nPiero. A deputation was chosen to carry the offer, which Lorenzo\r\naccepted after a becoming show of hesitation.\r\n\r\nLorenzo’s conduct shows that he was fully conscious of the altered\r\nposition which events had enabled him to assume. Hitherto the Medici had\r\nbeen content to intermarry with Florentine families, and thus to\r\nrecognise their equality of rank. But Lorenzo, as a prince, must seek a\r\nforeign bride, and he married Clarice Orsini, a daughter of the famous\r\nfamily of Roman nobles. Though his own tastes led him to show an\r\ninterest in art and literature, and to encourage [Sidenote:\r\nConstitutional changes.] the amusements of the people, he was also\r\ninspired by the wish to establish a court on the lines which had become\r\nfamiliar in the principalities of Italy. In their intercourse with\r\nLorenzo the Florentines showed a deference and even a servility which\r\nwould have been deemed wholly out of place in the days of Cosimo and\r\nPiero. This growth of a monarchical element within the republic is\r\nprobably the explanation of the numerous and obscure constitutional\r\nchanges which were made or attempted in the early years of Lorenzo’s\r\nadministration. Their essential object was to secure absolute control of\r\nappointments to the signory. In 1470 it was proposed that the\r\n_accoppiatori_ should be chosen every year by a new college of\r\nforty-five, consisting of men who had discharged this function since the\r\nreturn of the Medici in 1434. The scheme was denounced as an attempt to\r\nsubject the city to forty-five tyrants, and failed to pass the council\r\nof a hundred. In the next year, however, the same object was attained in\r\na different way. The existing _accoppiatori_ were associated with the\r\nsitting members of the signoria as a permanent committee, and the names\r\nwhich they proposed were to be carried in the Hundred by a bare\r\nmajority, instead of by the usual majority of two-thirds. In the same\r\nyear the legislative functions of the old councils of the people and of\r\nthe commune were suspended for ten years. It is difficult to estimate\r\nthe precise significance of these and other changes, but their general\r\neffect was to narrow the circle of families among whose members the more\r\nimportant offices circulated. This was certain to excite\r\ndissatisfaction; and among the malcontents we find the Pazzi, an old\r\nnoble family which had devoted itself to commerce, and now became rivals\r\nof the Medici in business as well as in politics.\r\n\r\nEvents proved that discontent within Florence was not very formidable,\r\nunless it was reinforced by [Sidenote: Foreign policy.] difficulties in\r\nforeign relations. Lorenzo had been brought up by his grandfather to\r\nregard Milan and Naples as the normal allies of Florence, Venice as a\r\ndangerous rival of Florence and a resolute opponent of the Medici\r\nascendency, and the papacy as a variable force depending on the\r\nidiosyncracies of rapidly changing popes, and requiring to be very\r\ncarefully watched. Lorenzo had learned the lesson, but with the egotism\r\nand self-sufficiency of youth he was not disinclined to attempt a few\r\nexperiments on his own account. If he could establish friendly relations\r\nwith the papacy and with Venice, he might make his own position stronger\r\nthan ever, and might pose as mediator and almost as arbiter in the\r\nrelations of the Italian states. On the election of Sixtus IV. in 1471,\r\nLorenzo went in person as Florentine envoy to carry the usual\r\ncongratulations. He returned not only with a confirmation of his banking\r\nprivileges in Rome, but with the lucrative appointment of receiver of\r\nthe papal revenues. At the same time he opened negotiations with Venice,\r\nwhich led in 1474 to the embassy of Tommaso Soderini and the conclusion\r\nof an alliance between Venice, Milan, and Florence.\r\n\r\nBut these new connections were dearly purchased by the alienation of\r\nNaples. Ferrante regarded Venice as the inveterate enemy of his kingdom\r\nand his family. As long as the Medici had identified their interests\r\nwith his own he had been eager to uphold [Sidenote: Alienation of Naples\r\nand quarrel with Sixtus IV.] their power in Florence. But a good\r\nunderstanding of Milan and Florence with Venice threatened Naples with\r\nisolation, and Ferrante must seek support elsewhere. Sixtus had already\r\nallowed the Neapolitan tribute to be commuted for a formal gift; and as\r\nthe ties between Naples and the papacy were drawn closer, a coolness\r\ngrew up between Sixtus and Lorenzo. The origin of the quarrel is to be\r\nfound in the opposition of Florence to the aggrandisement of Girolamo\r\nRiario (see p. 282). Lorenzo refused to find the money for the purchase\r\nof Imola, and the Pope transferred the post of receiver-general from the\r\nMedici to the Pazzi. The dispute was speedily embittered. Sixtus\r\nappointed Francesco Salviati to the archbishopric of Pisa without\r\nconsulting Lorenzo, and in defiance of his wishes. The Florentines, on\r\ntheir side, refused to admit the archbishop to his see; they supported\r\nthe Vitelli in Citta di Castello, and in many ways showed an inclination\r\nto thwart the Pope’s schemes in Romagna. For some time, however, the\r\ndispute did not seem likely to lead to serious results. But the death of\r\nGaleazzo Maria Sforza in 1476, and the obvious weakness of the\r\ngovernment of the regent, Bona of Savoy, encouraged the opponents of the\r\nMedici to bolder acts than they would have contemplated when Milan could\r\ngive efficient support to Florence. In 1477 Girolamo Riario and\r\nFrancesco Pazzi began to discuss in Rome [Sidenote: Conspiracy of the\r\nPazzi.] how to overthrow a family which stood in the way of both of\r\nthem. By the beginning of 1478 the main outlines of the conspiracy had\r\nbeen agreed to. Francesco Salviati and Jacopo Pazzi, the head of the\r\nfamily in Florence, had agreed to take part in the plot. It was\r\nunderstood that the Pope and the king of Naples would give active\r\nsupport, but they took no responsibilities for the actual means by which\r\nthe desired end was to be attained. Assassination was a recognised\r\nweapon in Italian politics, and it was obviously difficult to effect a\r\nrevolution in Florence without it. Sixtus IV. might plead that he was\r\nignorant of this part of the design, but morally the plea is worthless.\r\nIf the Medici government had been unpopular in Florence, it might have\r\nbeen possible to organise a rebellion and to overthrow them by means of\r\na parliament. But there was no widespread discontent in the city, and\r\nthe Pazzi had no strong following among either the lower or the wealthy\r\nclasses. It was decided, therefore, to kill Lorenzo and his brother\r\nGiuliano, and to trust to the resultant confusion and foreign\r\nintervention. A number of hired mercenaries, headed by Giovanni Battista\r\nda Montesecco, were engaged to carry out the two immediate objects—the\r\nmurder of the brothers and the seizure of the magistrates. It says much\r\nfor the fidelity of the plotters that no one was found to betray the\r\ndesign, in spite of the discouragement caused by unavoidable delays. The\r\ngreat practical difficulty arose from the necessity of assassinating\r\nLorenzo and Giuliano at the same moment, for fear that one might receive\r\nwarning from the fate of the other. And unless both were removed, the\r\nplot would end in failure. At last the desired opportunity was offered\r\nby a banquet which the Medici gave in honour of Cardinal Raffaelle\r\nRiario, a great-nephew of the Pope. But Giuliano was too unwell to\r\nattend, and the time and place had to be altered. On Sunday, April 26,\r\n1478, the two brothers were to be present at divine service in the\r\ncathedral, and the elevation of the host was to be the signal to the\r\nassassins. This gave rise to an unexpected difficulty. Montesecco, who\r\nhad undertaken to slay Lorenzo, refused to commit sacrilege by shedding\r\nblood in a church, and two priests were chosen to take his place. But\r\nthe priests, though they did not share the scruples, also lacked the\r\nstrength and skill of the soldier. As the little altar bell tinkled,\r\nGiuliano was struck down, and Francesco Pazzi dealt the final deathblow.\r\nBut Lorenzo was only wounded in the shoulder, and in the confused\r\nscuffle which followed he succeeded in escaping to the sacristy, where\r\nhis friends closed the bronze doors in the face of the murderers.\r\nElsewhere the conspirators were equally unsuccessful. Archbishop\r\nSalviati, who had gone to the Palazzo to superintend the seizure of the\r\ngonfalonier and priors, excited suspicion by his obvious agitation, and\r\nwas seized with several of his followers. Jacopo Pazzi headed a\r\nprocession through the streets with shouts of ‘Liberty,’ but the people\r\nraised the counter-cry of ‘Palle! Palle!’ in favour of the Medici, and\r\nthe leaders of the demonstration were carried by the mob to the Palazzo.\r\nOn the arrival of the news that Giuliano de’ Medici was dead, Francesco\r\nPazzi, the archbishop of Pisa, and several other prisoners were promptly\r\nhanged from the windows. Vindictive severity was shown to the Pazzi and\r\ntheir allies. Guglielmo Pazzi, who had married Lorenzo’s sister, was the\r\nonly member of the family who escaped. The two priests who had taken\r\nrefuge in a monastery were dragged from their sanctuary by the mob and\r\nbarbarously murdered. Montesecco had left Florence, but he was captured,\r\nand after giving evidence which implicated the Pope in the conspiracy,\r\nwas executed. One of the murderers succeeded in reaching Constantinople,\r\nbut even there the vengeance of the Medici was able to reach him. He was\r\nhanded over by Mohammed II., and brought back to Florence, where in 1479\r\nhe shared the fate of his accomplices.\r\n\r\nWithin Florence all danger was at an end. The cowardly nature of the\r\nattack rallied public opinion to the Medici; and [Sidenote: War with\r\nNaples and the Papacy.] the death of a brother, who had hitherto enjoyed\r\nthe larger share of popular favour, served to exalt the survivor and to\r\nremove from his way a possible rival. The fate of the conspirators was a\r\nstriking object-lesson to future malcontents. But Lorenzo’s signal\r\ntriumph only exasperated the foreign enemies whom his reckless policy\r\nhad alienated. He had broken up the triple alliance, in which Florence\r\nserved as a link between Milan and Naples, and had divided Italy into a\r\nnorthern and a southern league. These were now brought into collision by\r\nthe failure of the Pazzi conspiracy. Both Sixtus IV. and Ferrante of\r\nNaples had good reasons for desiring the overthrow of Lorenzo, and these\r\nreasons were multiplied now that success had made him more formidable.\r\nThe Pope, urged on by Girolamo Riario, and infuriated by the execution\r\nof an archbishop and the murder of priests, called upon the Florentines\r\nto banish Lorenzo, who was to be made the scapegoat for the crime of his\r\nopponents. The citizens refused to give up their leader, and published\r\nthe confession of Montesecco. Sixtus laid the city under an interdict,\r\nand prepared for war. The papal troops under Federigo da Montefeltro and\r\na Neapolitan army under Alfonso of Calabria marched into southern\r\nTuscany, where the adhesion of Siena gave the invaders a convenient base\r\nof operations. Florence appealed to her allies, and obtained assistance\r\nfrom Milan under Gian Jacopo Trivulzio, and from Venice under Galeotto\r\nPico of Mirandola. Ercole d’Este was appointed commander-in-chief for\r\nthe republic. Great hopes were also entertained of the intervention of\r\nFrance, and Louis XI. despatched Philippe de Commines to Italy to try\r\nwhat diplomacy could effect in favour of Lorenzo de’ Medici.\r\n\r\nIn 1478 Florence made a creditable resistance against superior forces.\r\nThe fortification of Poggio Imperiale blocked the Val d’Elsa, the most\r\nvulnerable approach to [Sidenote: Campaigns of 1478 and 1479.] the city;\r\nand when the disappointed invaders turned eastwards to the valley of the\r\nChiana, they had only completed the preliminary operation of taking\r\nMonte San Savino when winter put an end to operations. But in the\r\ncampaign of 1479 fortune turned decisively against the Florentines. A\r\nrevolution in Milan, which was dexterously organised by Ferrante, not\r\nonly compelled the withdrawal of the Milanese troops; but by\r\nsubstituting the rule of Ludovico Sforza for that of Bona of Savoy,\r\ndetached Milan for a time from the Florentine alliance. The Turkish\r\nattack on Scutari, which reduced Venice to such straits that it was\r\nnecessary to make the peace of Constantinople, and to refrain from any\r\nvigorous action in Italy, was also attributed by contemporary suspicion\r\nto the wily suggestions of the Neapolitan king. Worst of all, France\r\nwould not take action. A few hundred French lances would have been worth\r\nfar more than the threat of a general council which the Pope knew would\r\nnot be carried out. Florence found herself isolated and exposed to a\r\ncrushing attack. The plague broke out within the walls, Poggio Imperiale\r\nwas stormed, and nothing but the ponderous tactics of a mercenary army\r\nsaved the city from the necessity of an ignominious surrender. Lorenzo\r\nde’ Medici was in a very difficult position. In a sense the city was\r\nenduring these sufferings and risks on his behalf, and the loyalty of\r\nthe citizens might give way under an intolerable strain. He sought and\r\nfound a way out of the dilemma by an enterprise which his adherents and\r\napologists have agreed to consider [Sidenote: Lorenzo goes to Naples.]\r\nheroic. In December 1479 he set out on an embassy to Naples. The fate of\r\nJacopo Piccinino was sufficiently recent to convince people that it was\r\ndangerous to trust to the good faith of Ferrante, yet it is difficult to\r\nbelieve that Lorenzo undertook the journey without some fairly\r\nsubstantial assurance that there was less risk in it than appeared on\r\nthe surface. After all, Ferrante had originally been the cordial friend\r\nof Lorenzo; and although he had since then taken offence, he might be\r\nappeased by a renewal of the old understanding. Events had proved that\r\nit was not worth while to alienate Naples in order to establish better\r\nrelations with Venice, and Lorenzo was quite willing to do penance for\r\nhis blunder. And the alliance between Naples and the Pope did not rest\r\nupon very substantial foundations. Lorenzo could point out that Sixtus\r\nonly cared for the aggrandisement of his nephew, that he was already\r\npreparing to expel the Ordelaffii from Forli in order to give a duchy to\r\nGirolamo, and that a strong secular power in the papal states was by no\r\nmeans likely to benefit Naples. There was an ultimate argument in the\r\nrelations of the Medici with France. The revival of the Angevin claim\r\nwas a perpetual nightmare to Ferrante and his son, and it might well\r\nprove that the house of Aragon would find in a Florentine alliance a\r\nsubstantial bulwark to their throne. At all events, whether hazardous or\r\nnot, the enterprise was successful. Lorenzo returned to Florence in 1480\r\nwith a treaty of [Sidenote: Conclusion of peace, 1480.] peace. It was\r\nnot, of course, a very glorious agreement: the southern districts of\r\nFlorentine territory were ceded to Siena, the allies in Romagna were\r\nleft at the mercy of the Pope, and there was no provision for the\r\nrestoration of the northern fortress of Sarzana, which had been seized\r\nduring the war by the Fregosi of Genoa. But anything was better than the\r\ncontinuance of the war, and Lorenzo was hailed as the saviour of the\r\nstate. It is true that there was a momentary reaction, when it was found\r\nthat the Neapolitan forces were in no hurry to quit Tuscany, and that\r\nAlfonso was apparently taking advantage of party feuds in Siena to\r\nmaintain a permanent foothold in the province. But the Turks intervened\r\nto checkmate any such design, and the occupation of Otranto compelled\r\nAlfonso and his troops to retire for the defence of their own territory.\r\nEven the obstinate Pope was forced to give way by the danger from the\r\ninfidel. Sixtus ceased to insist that Lorenzo should make another more\r\nhumiliating, and perhaps more perilous journey to Rome, and withdrew the\r\ninterdict which he had launched against Florence for venturing to punish\r\necclesiastics for a flagrant crime.\r\n\r\nThe conspirators had failed, and foreign enemies had failed, to\r\noverthrow the Medici, and their failure necessarily strengthened the\r\ndynasty against which these strenuous [Sidenote: Constitutional changes\r\nin 1480.] attacks had been directed. In 1480 Lorenzo was able to carry\r\nthrough vital changes in the constitution which for the rest of his life\r\nsecured his authority against serious attack. It is noteworthy that no\r\nuse was made of the parliament, as on previous occasions, when\r\nrevolutionary decrees had to be enacted. The proposals were made by the\r\nsignoria and carried in the ordinary way through the three councils. A\r\nconstituent body of thirty was nominated by the signory. These were to\r\nappoint a ‘greater council’ of two hundred and ten members, afterwards\r\nenlarged to two hundred and fifty-eight, who were to act as a temporary\r\n_balia_, having power to legislate and to control the filling of the\r\nbags with the names of suitable candidates for office. In order to\r\nsecure a wide distribution of influence, no family, except two specially\r\nnamed, was to have more than three members on the council. By a far more\r\nimportant provision the thirty were to nominate another forty, and with\r\nthem were to constitute a permanent Council or Senate, known as the\r\nSeventy. The Seventy held office for life, and filled vacancies by\r\nco-optation. From among them were to be chosen the two important\r\nexecutive committees—the _Otto di Pratica_, who took the place of the\r\noccasional committees of eight or ten whom it had been usual to appoint\r\nin time of war, and the _Otto di Balia_, who superintended the police of\r\nthe city. The institution of the Seventy did not abolish any of the old\r\nmagistracies and councils; these still continued as a means of rewarding\r\nsupporters and flattering men’s love of importance. But it placed side\r\nby side with them what Florence had not for a long time possessed, a\r\npermanent machinery of government, and thus supplied the stability, the\r\nwant of which had been the chief cause which raised the Medici to their\r\nanomalous and ill-defined position in the state. It was inevitable that\r\nthe Seventy, with its two standing committees, should gradually draw\r\ninto its hands the real power which could never be effectually employed\r\nby officials who changed every two months.\r\n\r\nThe troubles of the last three years had taught Lorenzo a lesson which\r\nhe never forgot. The prompt punishment which followed his youthful\r\nerrors in statecraft had been [Sidenote: Lorenzo’s later years.] an\r\ninvaluable training to him. For the next twelve years the internal\r\nhistory of Florence is absolutely uneventful, a fact which is itself the\r\nbest evidence of the capacity of its ruler. Freed from the fear of\r\ndomestic opposition, Lorenzo could concentrate his attention on external\r\naffairs, and he became the foremost statesman in Italy. Reverting to the\r\nsound traditions which his grandfather had handed down, he maintained an\r\nalliance with Naples on the one side, and with Milan on the other, and\r\nwas thus enabled to check the aggressive tendencies of Venice and the\r\npapacy, and at the same time to avert the danger of foreign\r\nintervention. In the war of Ferrara (1482-84) he was an active member of\r\nthe coalition which saved the house of Este from annihilation, though he\r\nwas chagrined that the interested defection of Ludovico Sforza enabled\r\nVenice not only to escape well-deserved punishment, but also to retain\r\nthe polesina of Rovigo. In 1485 a more serious difficulty arose when the\r\nNeapolitan rebels, backed up by Innocent VIII., endeavoured to revive\r\nthe Angevin claims. Florence had no love for the house of Aragon, and\r\nwas closely connected by many ties with France. Fortunately, the appeal\r\nwas made to Réné of Lorraine instead of to Charles VIII., and so Lorenzo\r\ncould support the cause of Ferrante without any overt breach of the\r\nFrench alliance. And while engaged in these questions of high policy,\r\nLorenzo never lost sight of the immediate interests of Florence. He took\r\nadvantage of party feuds in Siena to procure the restoration of most of\r\nthe territories which had been ceded in 1480. And he not only recovered\r\nSarzana from Genoa, but he added to it the neighbouring fortresses of\r\nPietrasanta and Sarzanella, thus giving to Florence a strong frontier on\r\nthe ridge of the Apennines, which, if properly garrisoned, would have\r\nenabled the republic to check the invasion of Charles VIII.\r\n\r\nIn Lorenzo’s last years a new and momentous political problem was\r\ncreated by the growing alienation between Naples and Milan. Ludovico\r\nSforza could not carry out his designs upon his nephew’s duchy without\r\nincurring [Sidenote: Importance of Lorenzo’s death.] the hostility of\r\nFerrante and Alfonso; and upon Florence, as the middle state of the\r\nleague, devolved the responsibility of mediating between her two allies.\r\nIt was a task which required all Lorenzo’s tact, experience, and\r\npatience, and it may be doubted whether even he could have ultimately\r\nsucceeded in averting a collision. It is just possible, however, that\r\nconsummate prudence on the part of Florence might have prevented French\r\nintervention in Italy, and in that case the whole course of European\r\nhistory might have been altered. But in 1492, when the fate of Italy was\r\ntrembling in the balance, Lorenzo died; and his death at this critical\r\nmoment must be ranked with those other events—the discovery of America,\r\nthe conquest of Granada, and the election of Alexander VI.—which make\r\n1492 one of the most memorable years in the history of Europe.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said of the Florentine constitution to show that the\r\npower of the Medici did not rest upon very solid foundations. They had\r\nno military force [Sidenote: Recklessness of Piero de’ Medici.] behind\r\nthem; none of the ordinary securities on which a despotism must rely for\r\nits permanence. They ruled, partly because they supplied an element of\r\nstability, which the civic constitution notoriously lacked, partly\r\nbecause they maintained the credit and the influence of the state in\r\nItaly and in Europe, but mainly because they had managed to conciliate\r\nthe interests and the allegiance of a majority of the citizens. But if\r\nthe Florentines once felt that their own interests and the security of\r\nthe republic were endangered by the ascendency of the Medici, that\r\nascendency must inevitably fall. And this was precisely the impression\r\nwhich Piero, Lorenzo’s eldest son, set himself to produce. Discarding\r\nall pretence of civic equality, he indulged in the airs and pretensions\r\nof a prince born in the purple. And while his haughtiness disgusted the\r\nmass of the citizens, he made no effort to retain the support of the\r\nprominent families with whom his father had lived on familiar terms. But\r\nhis most fatal blunder was in foreign relations. His mother was an\r\nOrsini, and his wife was an Orsini, and under the influence of his\r\nforeign relatives he abandoned the mediating position of Lorenzo, and\r\nallied himself unconditionally with the rulers of Naples. This action\r\nhad a double result. It completed the exasperation of the Florentines,\r\nwho had never loved the Neapolitan alliance even when their trust in the\r\nwisdom of Cosimo or Lorenzo had convinced them that it was to their\r\ninterest to adhere to it. And it drove Ludovico Sforza into that\r\ndesperate appeal to France which was the immediate cause of Charles\r\nVIII.’s invasion. When the French came, Piero showed himself to be\r\npusillanimous as well as incompetent. He took no steps to hold the\r\ndefensible passes of the Apennines against the invaders; and when they\r\nhad reached Pisa, he sought to disarm their hostility by a more ruinous\r\nsurrender than the most extreme supporter of a French alliance would\r\nhave advocated. The patience of the citizens was exhausted; and Piero’s\r\nflight was followed by the expulsion of his family and the restoration\r\nfor a few troubled years of republican independence in Florence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n             BURGUNDIANS AND ARMAGNACS IN FRANCE, 1380-1435\r\n\r\n\r\n    Minority of Charles VI.—The princes of the lilies—Risings in\r\n    Paris—Intervention in Flanders—Battle of Roosebek and death of\r\n    Philip van Artevelde—Rule of the _Marmousets_—Insanity of Charles\r\n    VI.—Rivalry for the government—Philip the Bold of Burgundy—Louis of\r\n    Orleans—John the Fearless—Murder of Orleans—Outbreak of civil\r\n    war—The _Cabochiens_ in Paris—Victory of the Armagnacs in 1413—Henry\r\n    V. invades France—Battle of Agincourt—Armagnacs retain their\r\n    ascendency in France—English successes in Normandy—Burgundians seize\r\n    Paris—Murder of John the Fearless—Treaty of Troyes—War in Northern\r\n    France—Deaths of Henry V. and Charles VI.—John of Bedford and\r\n    Charles VII.—Divided allegiance of France—Humphrey of Gloucester and\r\n    Jacqueline of Hainault—Quarrels at the court of Charles VII.—Philip\r\n    the Good acquires territories in the Netherlands—Siege of\r\n    Orleans—Successes of Jeanne Darc—Her capture and death—Character of\r\n    the War—Quarrel of Bedford and Burgundy—Treaty of Arras and death of\r\n    Bedford.\r\n\r\nThe death of Charles V. in 1380 ushered in one of the most disastrous\r\nperiods in the history of France. The young [Sidenote: Minority of\r\nCharles VI.] Charles VI. was only eleven years of age, and the\r\ngovernment fell into the hands of his uncles, the dukes of Anjou, Berri,\r\nand Burgundy, and their brother-in-law, the duke of Bourbon. These men\r\nrepresented the new class of royal nobles, or princes of the lilies, and\r\nit was soon evident that their interests were those of their caste, and\r\nnot those of the monarchy with which they were connected by blood. Their\r\nconduct was characterised by the same selfish love of independence as\r\nhad been displayed by the older feudal nobles, whose lands had fallen to\r\nthem by inheritance, marriage, or royal grant. It was a momentous fact\r\nfor France that the power of the crown was wielded just at this time by\r\nmen who desired not to advance that power, but merely to abuse it for\r\ntheir own profit and that of their fellow-nobles. Everywhere feudalism\r\nwas fighting a final and desperate struggle to maintain itself against\r\nthe [Sidenote: Feudalism and its opponents.] forces which were destined\r\nto effect its overthrow. In Germany the Swabian towns were engaged in\r\nwar with the nobles, and the Swiss were preparing for the struggle in\r\nwhich they won their great victory of Sempach. In England social\r\ndiscontent was encouraged and organised by the teaching of Lollard\r\npriests, and the year 1381 witnessed the famous upheaval which is\r\nusually associated with the picturesque episode of the Kentish leader,\r\nWat Tyler. In Flanders the citizens of Ghent were heading a rebellion\r\nagainst their count, Lewis de Mâle; and though the latter succeeded in\r\ndetaching Bruges from the league of towns, he found the militia of Ghent\r\nmore than a match for his feudal levies, and was compelled to appeal for\r\nassistance to his suzerain, the French king. It is important to remember\r\nthat these movements were connected by more than the accident of\r\noccurring at the same time. News travelled more rapidly in the\r\nfourteenth century than it had done in earlier times, and a\r\nconsciousness of common class interests was beginning to unite men of\r\ndifferent countries, as common religious interests united them two\r\ncenturies later. Events in Germany and England, and still more events in\r\nFlanders, influenced opinion and action in France. The burghers of Paris\r\nand other towns had not forgotten their temporary triumphs in 1356 and\r\n1357, and in 1380 the general unrest in western Europe gave them a new\r\nstimulus to action just at a time when the change of government made\r\ntheir grievances more intolerable.\r\n\r\nEven under Charles V. the burden of taxation had excited indignant\r\nmurmuring, and on his deathbed the [Sidenote: Risings in Paris.] wise\r\nking had promised that the recent imposts on the sale of commodities\r\nshould be abolished. But Charles’s brothers needed money for their own\r\npurposes; and the eldest, Louis of Anjou, was so greedy, that he stole\r\nthe crown jewels and the treasure which Charles had amassed for his son.\r\nAn order was issued that the taxes should be collected in spite of the\r\npromised relief. Paris rose in revolt, and an ordinance was extorted\r\nfrom the terrified regents that all taxes imposed since the reign of\r\nPhilip IV. should be withdrawn. Peace was purchased for a year by this\r\nconcession; but at the beginning of 1382, while the regents were engaged\r\nin suppressing a rising in Rouen, an attempt was again made to collect\r\nthe tax on sales. The mob rose in arms, and their most common weapon\r\ngave them the name of _Maillotins_, or the hammerers. The streets were\r\nbarricaded, and again the government yielded. In May 1382 an amnesty was\r\npromised to the rebels, who showed their gratitude by a civic gift of a\r\nhundred thousand francs.\r\n\r\nThis treaty was the last act of the duke of Anjou, who had hitherto been\r\nthe guiding spirit in the regency. His one aim had been to collect funds\r\nfor an expedition to Italy, and in this year he set out for Naples to\r\nenforce his claim against Charles of Durazzo (see p. 154). His departure\r\nleft the chief power in the hands of Philip of Burgundy, who had bought\r\noff his elder and incapable brother, the duke of Berri, by handing over\r\nto him the wealthy province of Languedoc. Hitherto the French Government\r\nhad refused to give any assistance to the count of Flanders, who was\r\nreduced to great straits by a victory of the Gantois outside [Sidenote:\r\nIntervention in Flanders.] the walls of Bruges (May 2, 1382). Philip van\r\nArtevelde, the son of Jacob van Artevelde, was now more powerful than\r\nhis father had ever been. He was not only supreme in Ghent, but he\r\nclaimed to be _ruwaert_ or regent of the whole of Flanders. After his\r\nvictory he proceeded to lay siege to Oudenarde, the last stronghold of\r\nthe court and the Flemish nobles. If the town were allowed to fall, the\r\ntriumph of the burghers would be complete. There was sufficient evidence\r\nof intercourse between Ghent and Paris to excite the misgivings of a\r\nFrench ruler, and, moreover, the duke of Burgundy had a strong personal\r\ninterest of his own in the matter. He was the son-in-law, and his wife\r\nwas the heiress of Lewis de Mâle. It was imperative that he should\r\nstrike a blow on behalf of an authority that might before long be his\r\nown, and the French nobles were eager to suppress a civic revolt which\r\nset such a bad example to their own vassals. A large feudal force was\r\ncollected to advance to the relief of Oudenarde, and the young king\r\nhimself, who was keenly interested in military affairs, accompanied the\r\narmy in person. Filled with the confidence inspired by their recent\r\nvictory, the Flemings [Sidenote: Battle of Roosebek.] quitted their\r\nstrong position and advanced to attack a stronger and better-armed force\r\nthan their own. On the field of Roosebek they were enveloped by the\r\nconverging wings of the French army, and were almost annihilated. The\r\ncorpse of Philip van Artevelde was found at the bottom of a heap of the\r\nslain. A prompt advance must have resulted in the capture of Ghent, but\r\nthe French were satisfied with their success, and soon afterwards\r\nwithdrew. The chief sufferers were not the defeated Flemings, but the\r\n_Maillotins_ of Paris. The victorious army was irresistible on its\r\nreturn. Most of the leaders of the recent rebellion suffered death. The\r\ngates of the city were thrown down, and its municipal liberties were\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\nWith the suppression of the bourgeoisie all opposition to the regents\r\nseemed to be at an end. But in 1388 occurred a dramatic revolution which\r\nis a strange parallel to contemporary events in England. Charles VI.\r\ndeclared himself to be of age, dismissed his uncles to [Sidenote: Rule\r\nof the Marmousets.] their estates, and intrusted the Government to men\r\nwho had been trained in the service of his father. For the next four\r\nyears these _Marmousets_ or parvenus, as the nobles scornfully called\r\nthem, ruled with equal capacity and moderation. Suddenly, in 1392, came\r\nanother extraordinary change in the course of events. One of the ablest\r\nof the royal ministers was the Constable, Olivier de Clisson, a follower\r\nand fellow-countryman of Bertrand du Guesclin. An attempt was made to\r\nassassinate him in the streets of Paris, and the would-be murderers\r\nsought refuge with the duke of Brittany, who had a quarrel of his own\r\nwith the Constable. Charles VI. was furious, and led an army towards\r\nBrittany to exact vengeance. But his health was already [Sidenote:\r\nInsanity of Charles VI.] undermined by precocious debauchery and the\r\npremature possession of power. On the journey he became so violently\r\ninsane that he had to be kept in forcible restraint. He lived for thirty\r\nyears after this, but never recovered the complete control of his\r\nfaculties, though he had intervals of comparative lucidity. As a rule he\r\nwas worst in the hot weather of summer and autumn, and recovered to some\r\nextent in the colder months of winter and early spring. It would\r\nprobably have been better for France if his insanity had been complete\r\nand permanent, as in that case it would have been necessary to make\r\nregular provision for the regency. As it was, the government was still\r\ncarried on in the king’s name; but it was notorious that even when he\r\nwas at his best he had lost all strength of will, and was the obedient\r\nslave of whoever had control of his person at the time. These conditions\r\nled to that struggle for the exercise of power which brought such\r\ninnumerable woes to France in the next half century.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Burgundy was with the king at the time of the seizure, and\r\ntook prompt advantage of it to recover the authority which he had been\r\ncompelled to relinquish [Sidenote: Origin of party feuds.] four years\r\nbefore. By so doing he excited the bitter animosity of Louis of Orleans,\r\nthe king’s younger brother, who clamoured that he was ousted from his\r\nproper position by his uncle. From this rivalry arose in the course of\r\ntime the famous factions of Burgundians and Armagnacs, whose quarrels\r\ndistracted France and rendered the country an easy prey to the foreign\r\ninvaders. It would be useless and wearisome to trace in detail the\r\nfrequent fluctuations of success and failure, but it is important to\r\nform a clear idea of the position of the two antagonists, and of the\r\ninterests which became involved in their disputes.\r\n\r\nPhilip the Bold or the Rash (_le Hardi_) was the youngest and favourite\r\nson of King John, and had been taken prisoner with his father at\r\nPoitiers. To reward his bravery [Sidenote: Philip of Burgundy.] and\r\ndevotion John gave him the duchy of Burgundy when it fell in to the\r\nCrown in 1361 on the death of Philip de Rouvre. But the greatness of the\r\nhouse was mainly due to a lucky marriage. Charles V. procured for his\r\nbrother the hand of Margaret, the only child of Lewis de Mâle, count of\r\nFlanders, Artois, Nevers, Rethel, and Burgundy. When Lewis died, in\r\n1383, these territories came through his wife to Philip, who became at\r\nonce one of the wealthiest and most powerful princes in Europe. The\r\nobject of Charles V. in promoting this marriage had been to connect\r\nthese fiefs, and especially Flanders, more closely with France. The\r\nultimate result was precisely the reverse; the connection of Burgundy\r\nwith France was weakened. Commercial interests tended to sever Flanders\r\nfrom France and to attach it to England (see p. 71). These interests\r\nproved stronger than feudal and family ties. Instead of Flanders\r\nfollowing Burgundy, Burgundy followed Flanders. Thus, although the duke\r\nof Burgundy was the first peer of France, and as count of Flanders was\r\ndoubly a peer, yet he found himself more and more detached from France,\r\nand impelled to play the part of a foreign and independent prince. It is\r\nimportant to remember that part of Flanders and Franche Comté, or the\r\ncounty of Burgundy, were imperial fiefs, and had no legal connection\r\nwith France. As time went on this non-French element in the position of\r\nthe house of Burgundy was destined to be greatly extended. In 1385 an\r\nimportant double marriage was concluded with the Wittelsbach count of\r\nHolland, Hainault, and Zealand, the son of Lewis the Bavarian (see p.\r\n108). The son of Count Albert, afterwards William VI. (1404-1417), was\r\nto marry Philip’s daughter, Margaret; while Philip’s eldest son, John of\r\nNevers, was to marry Albert’s daughter, another Margaret. It was to\r\nstrengthen this alliance, which two generations later brought these\r\nWittelsbach possessions to the house of Burgundy, that Philip negotiated\r\nthe marriage of Charles VI. to a princess of another branch of the\r\nWittelsbach house, Isabel of Bavaria—a marriage that was fraught with\r\nanything but blessing to France. Another imperial fief, Brabant, which\r\nwas held by the aunt of Philip’s wife, passed in 1406 to his second son,\r\nAntony, and ultimately to the main Burgundian branch. This gradual\r\nabsorption of adjacent provinces by the Valois dukes gave to what came\r\nto be known as the Netherlands, or the Low Countries, their first\r\nsemblance of political unity.\r\n\r\nThe young Louis of Orleans was, in territorial power and prospects,\r\nquite insignificant by the side of his uncle and rival. His great\r\nambition was to redress this [Sidenote: Louis of Orleans.] obvious\r\ninequality. At every opportunity he induced his brother to alienate\r\ndomain-lands to him in spite of the protests of the _Marmousets_. By\r\nthese grants and by purchase he obtained the duchy of Orleans, which\r\nCharles V. had promised should never be severed from the Crown,\r\nPerigord, a part of Angoumois, and the counties of Valois, Dreux, and\r\nBlois. His marriage in 1386 with Valentina Visconti, daughter of Gian\r\nGaleazzo, which gave to his descendants a claim upon Milan in later\r\ntimes, brought to him a million francs as dowry, but in the way of\r\nterritory only the town of Asti in Lombardy, and the county of Vertus in\r\nChampagne. Louis even competed with his uncle for territories in the\r\nNetherlands, and in 1401 he agreed to purchase Luxemburg from Wenzel.\r\nBut this proved a complete fiasco, and Luxemburg was ultimately absorbed\r\nin the Burgundian dominions. One discreditable advantage in the struggle\r\nwas gained by the duke of Orleans. He became the paramour of the queen,\r\nIsabella of Bavaria, and by this means he not only secured her support,\r\nbut also the influence which she still retained over her unhappy\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nEarly in the fifteenth century changes took place in the personages of\r\nthe drama, though its action was only slightly changed by them. Philip\r\nthe Bold died in 1404, leaving three sons. The second son, Antony of\r\nRethel, succeeded his great-aunt in the duchy of Brabant and Limburg,\r\nand married Elizabeth of Luxemburg, a grand-daughter of the Emperor\r\nCharles IV. The youngest son, Philip, received only the county of\r\nNevers. With the exception of Nevers and Rethel, the whole magnificent\r\ninheritance [Sidenote: John the Fearless.] of Philip and Margaret passed\r\nto their eldest son, John, who also succeeded to the position of\r\nprotagonist in the party strife in France. John had been taken prisoner\r\nby the Turks at the famous battle of Nicopolis (1396), and the reckless\r\ncourage which he displayed on that occasion gained for him the name of\r\nthe Fearless (Jean sans Peur). He displayed the same impulsiveness in\r\npolitics as in the field, and this led him into criminal blunders, and\r\nultimately to a violent death. Like all politicians of the time, he\r\nsought to use marriage as a means of strengthening his position. His\r\neldest daughter was married to the duke of Guienne or dauphin, and the\r\nking’s second son, John of Touraine, was betrothed to the daughter of\r\nhis brother-in-law, William VI. of Holland.\r\n\r\nIn 1407 Louis of Orleans was assassinated in Paris; and after some\r\nhesitation, John the Fearless avowed himself to be the instigator of the\r\nmurder, and put forward [Sidenote: Murder of Orleans.] arguments to\r\njustify it. Instead of putting an end to the quarrel, this act proved\r\nthe occasion for civil war. The sons of the duke of Orleans deemed it a\r\nsacred duty to avenge their father’s death, and they were encouraged by\r\nthe support of all opponents of Burgundy. As they were young and\r\ninexperienced, the practical leadership of the party was undertaken by\r\nBernard of Armagnac, the father-in-law of the young Charles of Orleans,\r\nand himself the son-in-law of the duke of Berri, the only surviving\r\nuncle of the king. From him the party derived the name by which it is\r\nusually known both to contemporaries and to history.\r\n\r\nThe strife of parties had its origin in a purely personal rivalry for\r\npower, but it gradually came to absorb all the elements of social,\r\npolitical, and ecclesiastical conflict in France. Louis of Orleans was\r\nthe [Sidenote: Burgundians and Armagnacs.] champion of the past, of\r\nfeudal independence and privileges. His party, especially after his\r\ndeath, included most of the noble families of France. Louis had been the\r\nsupporter of Richard II. against Henry IV., of Wenzel against his rival\r\nthe Elector Palatine Rupert, of the Avignon popes against the policy of\r\nneutrality in the great schism. The Burgundians were forced to espouse\r\nthe opposite side in these disputes. They clamoured for financial\r\neconomy and encouraged the growth of municipal liberties. Flemish\r\ninterests impelled them to maintain a good understanding with Henry IV.\r\nafter his successful usurpation. In the matter of the schism they urged\r\nthe ‘way of cession,’ and thus gained the support of the University of\r\nParis. Orleans had alienated this powerful corporation by encouraging\r\nthe rival schools of Orleans, Montpellier, and Toulouse. The University\r\nof Paris showed such devotion to the Burgundian cause that Jean Petit,\r\none of the leaders of the Sorbonne, marshalled all the hackneyed\r\narguments in favour of tyrannicide in order to justify the murder of\r\nOrleans. But this went too far for doctors of more tender conscience,\r\nand at Constance Jean Gerson, the chancellor of the University, pressed\r\nfor the condemnation of Jean Petit’s discourse, and thereby incurred the\r\nbitter enmity of John the Fearless (see p. 218). The great strength of\r\nthe Burgundians lay in the enthusiastic support of the Parisians; the\r\nduke at once rewarded and conciliated their support by restoring in 1409\r\nthe municipal institutions which had been abolished in 1383.\r\n\r\nThe war has also a geographical as well as a social significance. The\r\nwest and south were Armagnac, while the north and east of France were\r\nBurgundian. This opposition was of long standing, and rested upon a\r\nsubstantial difference of race. In the south-west the strongest element\r\nof the population was the Romanised Celts; whereas in the north-east the\r\nTeutonic or Frankish race preponderated. For a long time, especially\r\nsince the Albigensian crusades, the south had been reduced to\r\nsubservience by the north, and in the Armagnac party it strove to shake\r\noff some of the fetters that had been imposed upon it.\r\n\r\nIn thus roughly estimating the significance of the civil strife in\r\nFrance, it is important to avoid being too precise and dogmatic. It was\r\nnot so much a struggle of principles as a personal quarrel, in which\r\ncertain principles became involved. It is to some extent misleading to\r\nspeak of the Armagnacs as an aristocratic, and the Burgundians as a\r\npopular or bourgeois party. The parties did not set out with definite\r\ncharacter and policy; but circumstances and momentary exigencies forced\r\nthem to seek allies where they could, and these allies could only be\r\ngained by at least a professed devotion to their interests. The age also\r\nis full of contradictions, which make it the more difficult to draw\r\ndefinite distinctions. The dukes of Burgundy were the champions of\r\nmunicipal privilege in Paris; in Flanders it was their first business to\r\nrestrict the independence of the cities. Philip the Bold declaimed\r\nagainst the extravagance of the government when he was excluded from it,\r\nand promised the people relief from taxation. But he was personally\r\nextravagant, his rule was at least as expensive as that of his\r\nopponents, and he died so profoundly in debt that his widow had to\r\nundergo a ceremonial proof of bankruptcy in order to secure the\r\ninheritance of her children from the disappointed creditors. Again,\r\nLouis of Orleans is apparently the champion of a reactionary feudalism;\r\nbut in another aspect he is a disciple of the Renaissance, and a patron\r\nof the new learning that was to overthrow the essential ideas of\r\nmediæval feudalism. In this, as in other respects, he may be\r\ninstructively compared with an Englishman who was almost his\r\ncontemporary, Humphrey of Gloucester.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for France that in the early stages of the quarrel\r\nlittle danger was to be feared from England. The minority of Richard II.\r\nwas disturbed at first by the social discontent which led to the rising\r\nof [Sidenote: Relations with England.] 1381, and afterwards by party and\r\npersonal jealousies which almost produced a great civil war. When\r\nRichard II. at last took the reins of government into his own hands and\r\neffected a temporary pacification, he began to prepare for his dramatic\r\nrevenge upon his opponents, and for that attempt to establish a despotic\r\npower which resulted in his deposition. The result was that during his\r\nreign the war with France languished. Truces were frequently made and\r\nprolonged, and during the interval of nominal hostility no operations of\r\nimportance were undertaken on either side. In 1396 Richard II. actually\r\npaid a visit to Paris, and was betrothed to Isabella, daughter of\r\nCharles VI. The revolution of 1399, which gave the English crown to\r\nHenry IV., seemed likely to bring about a resumption of hostilities,\r\nespecially when Henry married the dowager duchess of Brittany, and thus\r\nrenewed that connection with the house of Montfort which had in the past\r\ngiven the English an easy entry into France. But for some years Henry\r\nIV. sat but insecurely upon his throne, and the struggle against\r\nsuccessive rebellions left him little time or inclination for an\r\naggressive foreign policy. It was not until French parties were led by\r\ntheir irreconcilable enmity to each other to invite English intervention\r\nthat the prolonged suspension of hostilities between the two countries\r\ncame to an end.\r\n\r\nThe murder of the duke of Orleans exasperated, but at the same time\r\nintimidated the other princes of France, and their terror was increased\r\nby the punishment which the duke of Burgundy inflicted in 1408 upon the\r\ncitizens of Liége for a revolt against their bishop. In spite of the\r\npitiful entreaties of the widowed Valentina, John the Fearless was\r\nallowed to retain supreme control of the government through his\r\nson-in-law the dauphin, who was now put forward to represent his father;\r\nand the young duke of Orleans and his brother had to undergo the shame\r\nof a formal reconciliation with their father’s murderer. It was not till\r\n1410 that the first league of princes was formed to overthrow the\r\nBurgundian [Sidenote: Civil war breaks out in 1410.] ascendency. It\r\nincluded the dukes of Berri and Bourbon, Louis II. of Anjou, the titular\r\nking of Sicily, the sons of Louis of Orleans, and the counts of\r\nClermont, Alençon, and Armagnac. The duke of Brittany, who had\r\npreviously been the ally of Burgundy, also joined the league because a\r\ndaughter of John the Fearless had married the count of Penthièvre, on\r\nwhom the claims of the rival house of Blois had devolved. It would take\r\ntoo long to trace the actual progress of the war or to enumerate the\r\nhollow truces and treaties by which it was occasionally interrupted.\r\nNeither party could claim any monopoly of patriotism, and both appealed\r\nsuccessfully to England for assistance. In 1411 aid was sent to the\r\nBurgundians, and in the next year to their opponents. This was not due,\r\nas has often been asserted, to a politic desire to prolong the civil war\r\nin France, but was the result of a change of parties in England. In\r\n1411, when the Burgundian alliance was concluded, the Prince of Wales\r\nand the Beauforts were in power. In January 1412 their influence was\r\nundermined by an obscure intrigue, Henry Beaufort resigned the\r\nchancellorship, and the Prince of Wales, who had incurred his father’s\r\ndispleasure, quitted the court. The government fell into the hands of\r\nArchbishop Arundel and Thomas of Clarence, Henry IV.’s second son, and\r\nthey reversed the foreign policy of their predecessors. Clarence in\r\nperson commanded the expedition, which was despatched to help the\r\nArmagnacs, but did little except ravage Normandy and part of Guienne.\r\n\r\nThe chief interest in the struggle lay in the efforts of the Armagnacs\r\nto get possession of Paris, the stronghold of Burgundian influence. In\r\n1411 the princes advanced to besiege the city. The exigencies of the\r\ndefence gave a temporary ascendency to the lower class of the citizens,\r\nwho were the most enthusiastic partisans of Burgundy, and among them the\r\nlead was taken by the powerful guild [Sidenote: The Cabochiens in\r\nParis.] of butchers. One Caboche, a flayer, acquired an unenviable\r\neminence which gave to his associates the name of _Cabochiens_. For two\r\nyears they were all-powerful in the city, and their history is marked by\r\none of those extraordinary contrasts which are more familiar in the\r\nhistory of France than in any other country. On the one hand, their rule\r\nwas disgraced by the brutal atrocities of a Paris mob at its worst. On\r\nthe other hand, there must have been among their leaders men of virtue\r\nand capacity, who saw clearly the administrative evils under which\r\nFrance was suffering. On May 25, 1413, was issued the famous Cabochian\r\nordinance, containing 258 articles, which has been warmly praised by\r\nmore than one eminent historian as a wise and far-seeing measure of\r\nreform. But the authors of the ordinance hardly acted in its spirit, and\r\nit was so short-lived that it has no practical importance.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of Cabochian rule excited a strong reaction among the higher\r\nclass of citizens, and the Armagnacs were [Sidenote: Armagnac victory in\r\n1413.] enabled by their aid to enter Paris. The great ordinance was\r\nrevoked in September 1413, and all offices were transferred to members\r\nof the victorious faction. The dauphin, who had quarrelled with his\r\nfather-in-law, joined his former opponents, and this enabled them to\r\nclaim that they were governing in the king’s name and interest. In 1414\r\nthe Armagnacs assumed the offensive, drove the duke of Burgundy from one\r\ntown after another, and even invaded Artois. Before Arras a treaty was\r\nconcluded which left Paris and the persons of the queen and the dauphin\r\nin the hands of the Armagnacs. John the Fearless, chagrined by his\r\ndefeat, and excluded from all political influence, resumed those\r\nrelations with the English to which he was impelled by Flemish\r\ninterests. Henry V., who as Prince of Wales had shown himself disposed\r\nto aid the Burgundians in 1411, was now on the throne. He was free from\r\nsome of the difficulties which had made his father [Sidenote: English\r\ninvasion of France.] pursue a peace policy, and the condition of France\r\noffered him an irresistible temptation to renew the war. In 1415 he\r\nformally announced his intention of asserting his claim to the crown of\r\nFrance, and laid siege to Harfleur. The Armagnacs were by no means\r\ndismayed by the news. The militant instincts of an aristocracy were\r\nstrong among them, and a victory over the English invaders would\r\ncomplete their triumph over the Burgundians. A feudal army was hastily\r\ncollected under the constable d’Albret, and the offers of aid from Paris\r\nand other communes were haughtily rejected. The expected success was to\r\nbe for the party, not for the nation. But the military ability of the\r\nnobles was not equal to their exclusiveness. A slight exertion would\r\nhave relieved Harfleur, but the town was allowed to surrender on\r\nSeptember [Sidenote: Fall of Harfleur.] 22. This was a considerable gain\r\nto the English; for Harfleur, though less defensible than Calais, was\r\nfar better suited for aggressive purposes. It was the real key to\r\nNormandy, whereas the strength of Calais lay in its isolation. But the\r\nEnglish army had suffered heavily during the siege, and prudence seemed\r\nto dictate that it should either return to England or spend the winter\r\nin Harfleur. Henry, however, trusting to the incapacity and disunion of\r\nhis enemies, decided to lead his diminished army, not more than fifteen\r\nthousand at most, through a hostile country to Calais. The bridges on\r\nthe Somme had been broken down, and the English made for the famous ford\r\nof Blanchetaque, where Edward III. had effected his crossing before the\r\nbattle of Crecy. A prisoner declared that the ford was guarded by six\r\nthousand troops, and the English turned southwards to find another\r\ncrossing. One place after another was found to be impracticable, and the\r\narmy had passed Nesle before they discovered some marshy shallows which\r\ngave them the desired passage. They thus escaped the trap into which\r\nthey had fallen, but their march had brought them to the south of the\r\nFrench army, which in overwhelming numbers blocked the way to Calais. It\r\nwas necessary to fight or perish. In the [Sidenote: Battle of\r\nAgincourt.] battle of Agincourt (October 25, 1415) the muddy state of\r\nthe ground, the reckless insubordination of the French nobles, and the\r\nskill of the archers gave the English an extraordinarily easy victory.\r\nThe losses on the French side were enormously increased by a massacre of\r\nthe prisoners, which Henry ordered when the appearance of some\r\ncamp-followers was taken as the approach of a new army. Among the slain\r\nwere the constable d’Albret, the duke of Alençon, and the two brothers\r\nof John the Fearless, Antony of Brabant and Philip of Nevers. The duke\r\nhimself had refused to join his opponents, and his brothers only arrived\r\nin time to share the defeat. The most important of the prisoners whose\r\nlives had been spared were the young Charles of Orleans and the count of\r\nRichemont, brother of the duke of Brittany. As far as Henry V. was\r\nconcerned, he gained no immediate advantage in France, except the\r\nability to continue his retreat. He hastened to Calais, and there\r\nembarked for England.\r\n\r\nThe Armagnacs had destined for themselves all the glory of the expected\r\nvictory, and they had to endure all the shame of the defeat. The\r\nParisians openly exulted at [Sidenote: Continued party strife in\r\nFrance.] the humiliation of their oppressors, and prepared to welcome\r\nJohn the Fearless, who advanced as far as Lagni on his way to the\r\ncapital. But the duke had lost much of the energy of his younger days.\r\nBernard of Armagnac, who had played no part in recent events, hurried up\r\nfrom the south and took prompt measure to suppress the Burgundian\r\nsympathies of the citizens. He only arrived just in time. The dauphin,\r\nworn out by debauchery of every kind, died on December 18, and the heir\r\nof the throne was now John of Touraine, who was the creature of the\r\nBurgundian party. If John the Fearless had succeeded in reaching Paris,\r\nhis hold on the government would have been secure. But he had lost his\r\nopportunity, and retired after four months of absolute inactivity. His\r\nenemies called him in derision John of Lagni.\r\n\r\nIn 1416 there was no renewal of the English invasion, and the attention\r\nof Henry VI. was fully occupied with diplomacy. Sigismund had quitted\r\nConstance with the professed intention of putting an end to the\r\ninternational quarrels which impeded the work of the council. But his\r\nvisits to France and to England failed to effect the desired result.\r\nTheir chief result was to ally Sigismund with Henry V. and to bring\r\nabout a better understanding between the latter and the duke of\r\nBurgundy, who had found it difficult to maintain any alliance with\r\nEngland after the death of his two brothers at Agincourt. Meanwhile\r\nArmagnac continued a reign of terror in Paris. The citizens were\r\ndisarmed, the chains and barriers in the streets were removed, and a\r\nstrict system of espionage enabled the government to detect and punish\r\nany attempt to rebel. The atrocities of the _Cabochiens_ were equalled\r\nby their opponents, and without the excuse that could be offered for the\r\nbrutal action of a mob. The one difficulty in Armagnac’s way was the\r\nfact that the dauphin John was in the hands of the duke of Burgundy at\r\nValenciennes. But in April 1417 the dauphin died so opportunely that\r\nArmagnac was suspected of having brought it about. The only surviving\r\nprince, Charles, was the son-in-law of Louis II. of Anjou, and had been\r\nbrought up in bitter hostility to the Burgundians. The one influence\r\nover him that might stand in the way of Armagnac was that of his mother.\r\nIn a lucid interval Charles VI. was induced to notice and resent his\r\nwife’s notorious misconduct, and Isabel of Bavaria was sent into\r\ndisguised captivity at Tours. Indignant at this insult, she forgot the\r\nquarrel of a lifetime, sought the alliance of John the Fearless, and\r\nescaped from Tours with his aid. This encouraged the Burgundians to\r\nfresh exertions. The queen claimed to act as regent during her husband’s\r\n‘occupation,’ as it was euphemistically called. At Amiens she and the\r\nduke of Burgundy established a council and a parliament in opposition to\r\nthose in Paris, which were ‘subjected to the usurpers of the royal\r\npower.’ The civil war was carried on in a series of petty combats over\r\nthe northern provinces, in which each side was equally discredited by\r\nacts of the grossest brutality.\r\n\r\nThe renewed outbreak of civil war encouraged Henry V. to enter Normandy\r\nagain in 1417. Little resistance was offered to him, except at Caen, and\r\na truce with [Sidenote: English in Normandy.] the duke of Brittany gave\r\nhim a secure hold upon north-western France. The rapid success of the\r\nforeign invasion gave rise to negotiations between the French factions,\r\nand a treaty was on the verge of conclusion in May 1418, when it was\r\nbroken off by Armagnac and his brutal colleague, Tannegui du Châtel.\r\nThis was more than the Parisians could endure; the gates were opened to\r\nadmit a body [Sidenote: Burgundians seize Paris.] of Burgundian cavalry,\r\nand the citizens rose with cries of ‘Burgundy and peace.’ Armagnac was\r\ndiscovered and slain, but the dauphin succeeded in escaping to Melun,\r\nwhere he was joined by Tannegui and other followers, who had made a bold\r\nbut unsuccessful attempt to hold out in the Bastile. The revolution in\r\nParis gave to the Burgundians the ascendency in the north, but the\r\ndauphin continued to call himself lieutenant-general for his father, and\r\nset up a council and a parliament in Poitiers.\r\n\r\nOne result of the revolution was to impose the burden of national\r\ndefence upon the duke of Burgundy. The Parisians, although Burgundian,\r\nhad not ceased to be Frenchmen, and their clamour compelled the duke to\r\ntake measures against the English. He escorted the insane king to take\r\nthe oriflamme from St. Denis, and he established a camp at Beauvais.\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Rouen.] But he did nothing to relieve Rouen, which\r\nwas offering a heroic resistance to Henry V., and the town was forced to\r\ncapitulate on January 19, 1419. A systematic government was set up in\r\nNormandy as a dependency of the English crown.\r\n\r\nThe news of the fall of Rouen roused the national spirit of France. The\r\ntwo parliaments of Paris and Poitiers combined to demand internal peace\r\nin the face of [Sidenote: Negotiations between the factions.] the\r\nforeign foe. On May 14 a truce for three months was concluded. But the\r\nEnglish successes continued, and the capture of Pontoise enabled them to\r\nthreaten Paris. The pressure of imminent danger forced the rival\r\nfactions into closer relations with each other, and it was agreed that a\r\nmeeting should take place between the dauphin and John the Fearless for\r\nthe final settlement of all differences. This was a great blow to the\r\nextreme Armagnacs, who dreaded the loss of power and the vengeance of\r\nBurgundy. Tannegui du Châtel and his associates determined by a\r\ndesperate act to put an end to all [Sidenote: Murder of John of\r\nBurgundy.] prospects of pacification. The interview took place on\r\nSeptember 10, 1419, on the bridge at Montereau, and John the Fearless\r\nwas treacherously assassinated by the dauphin’s followers. Whether\r\nCharles himself was aware of the plot beforehand is open to question,\r\nbut by continued association with the murderers he made himself an\r\naccomplice after the event.\r\n\r\nThe murder of John the Fearless was a fatal event for France. It revived\r\nthe unity of the Burgundian party, which had been rapidly breaking up,\r\nand for the moment [Sidenote: Treaty of Troyes, 1420.] it subordinated\r\nall sentiment of nationality to the desire for revenge. The young duke\r\nPhilip vowed that the dauphin, whom he regarded as his father’s\r\nassassin, should never sit upon the throne of France. Isabel of Bavaria,\r\nwho had never loved her youngest son, did not scruple to join the duke\r\nin a close alliance with the English. The treaty of Troyes (May 21,\r\n1420) excluded the dauphin from the succession, arranged that Henry V.\r\nshould marry Katharine of France, that he and his descendants should be\r\nthe heirs of Charles VI., and that Henry should be regent during the\r\nlifetime of his father-in-law. Normandy and all other English conquests\r\nwere to be reunited to the French crown on Henry’s accession, and he\r\nswore to observe the laws and customs of France. Paris, already\r\ndominated by Burgundian partisans, and exposed to the danger of English\r\nattack from Pontoise, could make no resistance to an arrangement which\r\nproposed to subject France to an English dynasty.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Troyes was a treaty with one of the factions in France; it\r\nwas not a treaty with the French nation. In order to carry it out it was\r\nnecessary to enforce [Sidenote: War in northern France.] the submission\r\nof the Armagnacs, who had the support of almost all the provinces south\r\nof the Loire, and also held a number of strong places north of that\r\nriver. The reduction of the latter was the first task of the English and\r\nBurgundians. Some of them surrendered readily, but Melun held out for\r\nfour months, and with its fall the campaign of 1420 ended. Henry V.\r\nreturned to England, but was recalled by the news of a serious reverse.\r\nThomas of Clarence, who had been left in command, was defeated and slain\r\nby a combined force of French and Scots at Baugé in Anjou (March 23,\r\n1421), and a rising in favour of the dauphin took place in Picardy.\r\nHenry’s return restored victory to the English arms. While Philip of\r\nBurgundy put down the malcontents in Picardy, the English laid siege to\r\nMeaux, the chief Armagnac stronghold in northern France. With its\r\nsurrender (March 22, 1422) the supremacy of the allies to the north of\r\nthe Loire seemed to be assured. A few adventurers, at the head of\r\nmercenary forces, remained to pillage the country, but there was no\r\nlonger any centre of organised resistance to the English. Their army was\r\npreparing to cross the river when it was recalled by the news that Henry\r\nV. had died of dysentery, at the early [Sidenote: Deaths of Henry V. and\r\nCharles VI.] age of thirty-four (August 31, 1422). Seven weeks later,\r\nthe unfortunate Charles VI. was also carried to the grave, accompanied\r\nby the tears of his subjects, who remembered that if he had never ruled,\r\nso he had never oppressed them. None of his own family were present at\r\nthe funeral, and the only mourner of princely rank was the Duke of\r\nBedford, now regent of France for the infant Henry VI., who was solemnly\r\nproclaimed King of France and England.\r\n\r\nFor several years after 1422 there were two kings of France—Henry VI.,\r\nrepresented by his uncle Bedford, with Paris as his capital; and Charles\r\nVII., a youth of twenty years of age, at Bourges. The position\r\n[Sidenote: Bedford and Charles VII.] of the latter had been completely\r\nchanged by the treaty of Troyes. He was no longer the mere head of an\r\nunscrupulous and discredited faction, but the leader of a national\r\ncause. This washed out the stain of the murder of Montereau. There was\r\nhardly a French nation as yet, otherwise Henry V. had never conquered\r\nNormandy, but there was certainly a sentiment of nationality. A duke of\r\nBurgundy, half of whose possessions lay outside France, might be\r\ncomparatively free from such a sentiment, but his French subjects were\r\nnot. From the very first the result of the struggle was certain. All the\r\npermanent influences were in favour of Charles and against England. Only\r\ntwo things were necessary to secure the victory of Charles VII.—the\r\nnational sentiment must be kindled into a blaze, which was done by\r\nJeanne Darc, and Burgundy must be detached from England. This was sooner\r\nor later inevitable, both from the natural jarring of interests and from\r\nthe pressure brought to bear upon the duke by his own followers. Henry\r\nVI. wore the crown of France, partly by virtue of the Burgundian\r\nalliance, and partly because the feeling of national union had been\r\noverpowered for a time by domestic feuds and by the misery which they\r\nhad brought to the country. Directly this double basis collapsed, the\r\nEnglish power fell. That it lasted as long as it did was due to the\r\ndifference between the respective leaders. John of Bedford was a great\r\nsoldier and a great diplomatist; there was no one on the French side who\r\nequalled him in either capacity. Charles VII. may have had scant justice\r\ndealt to him by historians, and his latest biographer would have us\r\nbelieve that he was a model of kingly virtues. But these virtues, such\r\nas they were, were developed by adversity. At the time when he assumed\r\nthe royal title, he was too young to have much experience of government,\r\nhis training had been against him, and he had been fatally compromised\r\nby the criminal violence of his associates. He was not personally a\r\ncoward, but he disliked war, and he disliked publicity. Two important\r\ncities—Bourges and Poitiers—remained faithful to him, but he preferred\r\nthe more congenial solitude of Loches and Chinon. He had excellent\r\nadvisers. The council and parliament which he established at Poitiers\r\ncomprised many of the ablest members of those institutions who had left\r\nParis in 1418. So far as it was possible to conduct a civil government\r\nduring the war, it was conducted well. But against these civilian\r\nadvisers must be set the influence of brutal adventurers, such as\r\nTannegui du Châtel, whose services he could not dispense with, and whom\r\nhe was too feeble to restrain. Their gradual disappearance enabled him\r\nat last to free himself from the Armagnac party, and to render\r\nconspicuous services to France. But for the first seven years of his\r\nreign he had to contend with inferior instruments against superior\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nGeographically, France was fairly evenly divided. Paris, with the Ile de\r\nFrance, Normandy, Picardy, Champagne, and all the Burgundian fiefs,\r\ntogether with Western Guienne and Gascony, recognised [Sidenote:\r\nDivision of France.] Henry VI. Maine and Anjou were a battleground\r\nbetween parties. Their duke, Louis III., was absent in Italy, engaged in\r\nthe effort to secure the succession in Naples. His mother—Yolande of\r\nAragon—was the mother-in-law of Charles VII., and an influential\r\npersonage at his court. Charles could count, in the first place, upon\r\nthe provinces which he had held in fief before his father’s\r\ndeath—Touraine, Dauphiné, Berri, and Poitou. Orleans, whose duke was\r\nstill a prisoner in England, was loyal, and so were Auvergne, Lyons,\r\nBourbon, Languedoc, and the eastern parts of Guienne and Gascony. The\r\nduke of Brittany was doubtful. He was intimately connected with both\r\nparties. He had married Charles VII.’s sister, but he was the nephew\r\nthrough his mother of the first duke of Burgundy, and that mother had\r\nbeen the second wife of Henry IV. of England. His family was under great\r\nobligations to England, but his subjects were, for the most part, averse\r\nto the English alliance; and his brother—Arthur of Richemont—had been\r\none of Henry V.’s prisoners at Agincourt. For the moment the attitude of\r\nJohn V. was decided by a foolish attempt on the part of the Armagnac\r\nleaders to excite a revolt in Brittany in favour of the count of\r\nPenthièvre. This drove the duke, in 1423, to acknowledge Henry VI. and\r\nto make a treaty with the dukes of Bedford and Burgundy. At the same\r\ntime, Bedford tried to strengthen the ties between Burgundy and England\r\nby marrying Philip’s sister Anne. There were three provinces—Lorraine,\r\nSavoy, and Provence—which were not French, but for many years had been\r\ninvolved by their geography in French politics. Provence belonged to the\r\nduke of Anjou, and was certain, sooner or later, to support Charles VII.\r\nAmadeus VIII. of Savoy was the uncle of the duke of Burgundy, but held a\r\nneutral position, and tried to play the part of mediator. Charles of\r\nLorraine had been an ardent Burgundian partisan, and had been appointed\r\nconstable in 1418 by John the Fearless. But since then he had been\r\ngained over by Yolande, and induced to marry his only daughter to her\r\nsecond son, Réné.\r\n\r\nThe actual military operations were not, for some time, of first-rate\r\nimportance. There was no campaign on a large scale, and only two battles\r\nwhich deserve mention. A few places in the north, notably Guise and\r\n[Sidenote: Campaigns of 1423-24.] Ivry, held out for Charles VII., and\r\nPicardy was always ready to revolt. Important assistance was rendered by\r\nScotland, the permanent ally of France against England. Buchan, a Scot,\r\nwas appointed constable of France, and the earl of Douglas, who brought\r\na number of adventurers, was created count of Touraine. In 1423 a mixed\r\nFrench and Scottish army was defeated by the English and Burgundians at\r\nCrevant. In 1424 a more important engagement took place. The English had\r\nlaid siege to Ivry, and a great effort was made to relieve the garrison.\r\nBedford in person met the relieving army at Verneuil, and inflicted a\r\ncrushing defeat upon them. Douglas, Buchan, and a number of French\r\nnobles were slain; Maine was completely reduced, and the remaining\r\nfortresses in Picardy surrendered.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Bedford’s progress was arrested, and his whole design\r\nwas threatened with ruin by the action of his brother, Humphrey of\r\nGloucester, whose reckless selfishness nearly effected a complete\r\nrupture [Sidenote: Gloucester quarrels with Burgundy.] with Burgundy.\r\nThe dearest aim of Philip the Good was to absorb the dominions in the\r\nNetherlands of the two collateral branches of his house.[11] Holland,\r\nHainault, and Zealand had now passed, by the death of William VI., to\r\nhis only daughter, Jacqueline. Another of Philip’s uncles, Antony of\r\nBrabant, had left two sons, John IV. and Philip. The duke of Burgundy\r\nhad contrived to unite these two lines into one by marrying Jacqueline\r\nto John IV. of Brabant. But the marriage was inharmonious, Jacqueline\r\nfled from her husband, and appealed for aid to the duke of Gloucester.\r\nPhilip was infuriated when he learned that Gloucester had actually\r\nmarried Jacqueline, having obtained a dispensation from the old\r\nanti-pope, Benedict XIII. A prolonged and intricate quarrel followed.\r\nGloucester claimed his wife’s territories and defied Philip, who\r\nsupported John of Brabant, to mortal combat. Bedford was in despair. He\r\nendeavoured to pacify Philip by ceding to him the Picard towns of Roye,\r\nMondidier, and Péronne, and by allowing him to annex to Burgundy the\r\ncounties of Auxerre and Macon. Fortunately, Gloucester was as changeable\r\nas he was rash and hot-tempered. He repudiated Jacqueline in order to\r\nmarry Eleanor Cobham, and Philip the Good was free to settle matters\r\nwith his cousin without being hampered by English intervention. But\r\nGloucester continued to put difficulties in Bedford’s way. He quarrelled\r\nso violently with his uncle, Henry Beaufort, that Bedford was compelled\r\nto return to England, where the task of peacemaker detained him from\r\nDecember 1425 till the spring of 1427.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Philip of Burgundy had been nearly impelled by the conduct of\r\nGloucester to desert England and come to terms with Charles VII. One\r\ndifficulty in the way was removed by the dismissal from the court\r\n[Sidenote: Quarrels at the court of Charles VII.] of Tannegui du Châtel\r\nand the other accomplices of the assassination at Montereau. Philip had\r\ndeclared that he would never pardon the murderers of his father, and the\r\nnegotiations with Burgundy enabled Yolande and the wiser advisers of\r\nCharles VII. to procure their expulsion. The office of constable was\r\ngiven to the count of Richemont, and this induced the duke of Brittany\r\nto acknowledge Charles. The latter could now claim to be no longer the\r\nchampion of the Armagnacs, but a national king, and a reconciliation\r\nwith Burgundy seemed to be the natural and inevitable result of the\r\nchange. But the hopes of all patriotic Frenchmen were disappointed for a\r\ntime by Charles’s weakness of character. In his youth he was always\r\nunder the thumb of a favourite, and the favourite at this moment was\r\nPierre de Giac. Giac’s wife had been the mistress of John the Fearless,\r\nand she had been employed to induce him, in spite of warnings, to keep\r\nhis appointment at Montereau. With such a record behind him, it was\r\nnatural that Giac should do all in his power to thwart the negotiations\r\nwith Burgundy. Richemont, who had just returned to Bourges from an\r\nunsuccessful campaign in Normandy, was furious at the frustration of a\r\nproject on which the salvation of France depended. The favourite was\r\nseized at night, condemned to a hasty trial, and drowned. A successor,\r\nwho incurred the displeasure of the rugged constable, was assassinated.\r\nCharles VII. could not venture to punish those acts of violence, but he\r\nrefused to pardon or trust their instigator. As intimidation had failed,\r\nRichemont tried a new way to effect his object. He introduced a new\r\nfavourite, George de la Tremouille, who proved the evil genius of the\r\nking and of France for the next six years. La Tremouille became\r\nall-powerful at court, but he turned against the patron to whom he owed\r\nhis advancement. Richemont was banished from Bourges, and a small civil\r\nwar broke out between his partisans and those of the favourite. The\r\ncondition of France seemed more hopeless than ever. The reconciliation\r\nwith Burgundy had failed; and, to make matters worse, the duke of\r\nBrittany, left unaided to oppose the English, had made terms with them\r\nat the end of 1427 and had become the vassal of Henry VI.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bedford had succeeded, by persistent diplomacy, in removing\r\nthe difficulties that stood in his way. Henry Beaufort was gratified by\r\nbeing allowed to receive the cardinal’s hat, which Henry V. had\r\nforbidden, and was induced to leave England in order to head a crusade\r\nagainst the Hussites in Bohemia. The quarrel between Gloucester and\r\nBurgundy was terminated by the former’s marriage, and by the death in\r\n1427 of Jacqueline’s lawful husband, John of Brabant, whose duchy passed\r\nto his younger [Sidenote: Burgundian aggrandisement in the Netherlands.]\r\nbrother. Philip the Good might not be a very devoted ally, but no\r\nopposition was to be expected from him as long as he was allowed to\r\nswallow the Netherlandish provinces at will. His war with Jacqueline\r\ncontinued until she undertook to acknowledge him as her heir in Holland,\r\nHainault, and Zealand, and to grant him the immediate administration of\r\nthese provinces as her mainbourg. Luxemburg was in the hands of\r\nElizabeth, widow of Philip’s uncle, Antony of Brabant. She was no\r\nrelation by blood to the house of Burgundy, and there were members of\r\nher own family to whom the duchy ought to have passed, but Philip\r\nsucceeded in the end in securing possession of Luxemburg. Namur he\r\npurchased from its count. The only provinces in the Netherlands which\r\nwere free from Burgundian domination were the duchy of Gelderland and\r\nthe bishoprics of Liége and Utrecht.\r\n\r\nBurgundy being thus pacified, Bedford was encouraged by the mingled\r\nfolly and misfortunes of his opponents to make new exertions in France.\r\nIn 1428 he received [Sidenote: Siege of Orleans.] reinforcements under\r\nthe earl of Salisbury, and a regular campaign was planned instead of the\r\npetty local war of partisans that had been carried on for the last four\r\nyears. It was determined to lay siege to Orleans, which was situated at\r\nthe elbow of the Loire, and constituted the key to southern France. Its\r\ncapture would involve the submission of Touraine, Berri, and Poitou, the\r\nvery heart of Charles VII.’s kingdom. The importance of the siege was\r\nfully recognised, and desperate exertions were made both for the attack\r\nand the defence. The English forces were not numerous enough to form a\r\ncomplete blockade, but they gradually drew nearer and nearer, and their\r\nengineering works were regarded as the masterpieces of the age. The\r\nFrench attempted to cut off a large convoy of provisions, escorted by\r\nSir John Fastolf, but they were defeated in the battle of the Herrings.\r\nThis skirmish seemed likely to decide the fate of the city. The besieged\r\nsent envoys to Philip of Burgundy, offering to surrender to him if the\r\nEnglish would withdraw. Philip was eager that the offer should be\r\naccepted, but Bedford replied that after having beaten the bushes he\r\nwould not allow another to seize the birds. The duke was so indignant\r\nthat he ordered his own troops to retire, and thus a second blow was\r\nstruck at the Anglo-Burgundian alliance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Charles VII., whose kingdom was at stake, was doing nothing.\r\nTremouille would not allow him to arrange terms with the constable, and\r\nassistance from Scotland, which was urgently demanded, could not arrive\r\n[Sidenote: Appearance of Jeanne Darc.] in time to save Orleans. It was\r\nat this juncture that Jeanne Darc made her famous appearance at Chinon.\r\nIt is impossible, in a concise narrative, to do justice to the\r\nextraordinarily dramatic episodes that followed in such rapid\r\nsuccession. All that can be attempted is to tell the story of the chief\r\nevents in which Jeanne played her part, without endeavouring to discuss\r\nher claim to supernatural guidance, or to throw any new light upon her\r\nremarkable character and influence. Great efforts were made by the\r\ncourtiers to exclude her from the royal presence; but the impression she\r\nhad already made upon the common people, and the influence of Yolande of\r\nAragon, at last brought about the desired meeting. She gained the\r\nconfidence of the king by reassuring him about the legitimacy of his\r\nbirth, a matter on which he entertained not unnatural doubts, though he\r\nhad never communicated his misgivings to any one. After some delay, a\r\nforce was raised with which she entered Orleans on April 29, 1429. On\r\nMay 4 the attack upon the English [Sidenote: French successes in 1429.]\r\npositions was commenced, and on May 8 the siege was raised. Jeanne\r\nherself carried the great news to Charles VII. at Loches, and insisted\r\nthat he should accompany her to Rheims for his coronation, which had\r\nnever yet taken place. The indolent king and his courtiers were\r\nreluctant to undertake a long and hazardous march through a country\r\nwhich had long been held by the enemy, but the persistence of the\r\nvictorious maid carried the day. To the astonishment of Europe, the\r\nFrench had suddenly become invincible. Jargeau was stormed, a large body\r\nof English under Talbot and Fastolf was routed at Patay (June 18), and\r\none town after another opened its gates to the advancing army. In Troyes\r\nit was determined to make a stand, but at the first assault the citizens\r\nrose and compelled the garrison to surrender. On July 16 Rheims was\r\nentered, and on the next day the coronation took place with the\r\naccustomed formalities.\r\n\r\nThe daring and success of the march to Rheims made a profound\r\nimpression. Jeanne clamoured for an immediate advance upon Paris, and it\r\nis probable that if she had had her way the capital would have fallen.\r\nBedford was in despair. In Normandy the opponents of English rule were\r\ngaining ground, and the loyalty of the Parisians was doubtful. To obtain\r\nan army he had to conclude his famous agreement with Cardinal Beaufort,\r\nby which the troops which had been collected for the Hussite war were\r\ndiverted, much to the indignation of Martin V., to make war upon Charles\r\nVII. In order to secure Paris, he had to appeal to the duke of Burgundy,\r\nand to purchase his continued support by the cession of Meaux and by the\r\nappointment of a Burgundian partisan to the office of captain of the\r\ncity. Fortunately for the English regent, there was treachery and\r\ndivision in the royal camp. La Tremouille and his associates were eager\r\nto destroy the ascendency which Jeanne was acquiring over the king. She\r\nwas known to have advised him to come to terms with the constable and to\r\nfree himself from evil advisers, and they felt that the triumph of\r\nFrance would be dearly purchased at the cost of their own overthrow. And\r\nalthough the younger leaders, such as Dunois, the bastard half-brother\r\nof the duke of Orleans, were devoted to the heroine, the older\r\ncommanders were indignant at being controlled by a girl. Jeanne found\r\nthat she had to contend with a regular conspiracy, of which Charles VII.\r\nhimself, to his eternal shame, was a willing accomplice. Futile\r\nnegotiations with Burgundy provided a pretext for a delay which enabled\r\nBedford and Beaufort to bring up troops for the defence of Paris. But a\r\nrising in Normandy compelled Bedford to retire northwards, and Jeanne at\r\nlast succeeded in inducing the royal forces to advance. Compiègne,\r\nSenlis, and Beauvais surrendered in rapid succession. From Beauvais, the\r\nbishop, Pierre Cauchon, was expelled as an English partisan, and he was\r\ndestined to take a terrible revenge for the injury. But at St. Denis,\r\nCharles VII. refused to run any further risks, although his approach\r\nwould probably have induced the Parisians to rise. Losing all patience,\r\nthe maid attacked the fortifications with a volunteer force, but met\r\nwith her first repulse. She returned to St. Denis with the proposal to\r\ncross the Seine and attempt a new attack on the right bank. To her\r\nhorrified amazement, the bridge had been destroyed by order of the royal\r\ncouncil. Against such despicable treachery it was impossible to contend.\r\nCharles withdrew to the Loire and disbanded his army. Jeanne with\r\ndifficulty obtained leave to attack some of the smaller places on the\r\nLoire, but after some successes she was driven back from La Charité, to\r\nthe undisguised relief of the courtiers.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these bitter disappointments, the French cause had made\r\nimmense strides in 1429. The attack on Orleans had been foiled, the\r\ngreater part of Champagne and Brie had been recovered, and the dormant\r\nloyalty of the northern peoples had received a sudden stimulus. But\r\nthese successes had also served to give new vigour to the alliance\r\nbetween Burgundy and England. Philip was no longer a loyal supporter of\r\nHenry VI., but he was not prepared to acquiesce in a triumph of Charles\r\nVII. that was obtained without his aid. Moreover, his greed for\r\nterritory was by no means satisfied, and he knew that as the English got\r\ninto difficulties the value of his aid would increase. Bedford was quite\r\nwilling to pay the price, and offered the investiture of Champagne. It\r\nis true that the province was no longer in English hands, and that its\r\nacceptance imposed upon Philip the necessity of recovering it from the\r\nFrench. But Champagne was of superlative importance to the duke, because\r\nit would serve to unite his two chief possessions—Flanders and the duchy\r\nof Burgundy. He accepted the offer of the regent, and in 1430 the\r\nBurgundian troops once more [Sidenote: Capture of Jeanne.] took the\r\nfield and laid siege to Compiègne. The news that one of her precious\r\nconquests was threatened, roused Jeanne from the inaction in which she\r\nhad been kept against her will. Without authority from the king, she\r\ncollected a small band of devoted followers, and threw herself into the\r\nbesieged town. It was her last enterprise. A sortie which she headed was\r\nrepulsed, and she was cut off before she could regain the\r\nfortifications. She was taken prisoner by the followers of John of\r\nLuxemburg, a cadet of the house of St. Pol (May 24, 1430).\r\n\r\nFrom the English point of view, the capture of Jeanne was insufficient.\r\nThe impression she had made must be [Sidenote: Her trial and death.]\r\neffaced, and she herself must be discredited as well as punished. A\r\ncharge of heresy and witchcraft was equally suggested by the\r\nsuperstition of the age and by the extravagant claims to supernatural\r\npowers which Jeanne herself had put forward. It was natural for her\r\nenemies to hold that these powers came not from above, but from Satan.\r\nThe university of Paris, which boasted itself the home of the highest\r\nlearning of the time, gave the first cue for persecution. They demanded\r\nthat she should be tried before the inquisition of faith, which had been\r\nestablished in France by Innocent III., but had since fallen into\r\noblivion. But the university was not sufficiently under English\r\ndictation, and they had a more suitable instrument to hand. The bank of\r\nthe Oise on which Jeanne had been captured was just within the bishopric\r\nof Beauvais; and Pierre Cauchon, an exile from his diocese, and\r\nambitious of the archbishopric of Rouen, was at the beck and call of\r\nBedford. He demanded the surrender of the prisoner to his jurisdiction,\r\nand undertook the necessary negotiations with John of Luxemburg and his\r\nsuzerain. In ordinary times Philip the Good might have preferred to\r\nretain so valuable a prize; but his cousin, Philip of Brabant and\r\nLimburg, had just died, and he was anxious to secure the succession. The\r\nNevers branch of his house had strong claims to a partition of the\r\ninheritance; and as Bedford’s intervention might prove decisive, it was\r\nimperative to avoid any quarrel with the English. The bargain was\r\nquickly settled. John of Luxemburg carried his prisoner into Artois,\r\nresigned her to his suzerain, and left to the duke of Burgundy the\r\ndisgrace of selling the champion of France to the foreigner. In November\r\n1430 the shameful transaction was completed. Into the details of the\r\ntrial, with its arid scholasticism and its wanton brutality, it is\r\nunnecessary to enter. The presiding judge was the bishop of Beauvais,\r\nbut he was guided throughout by Bedford and Cardinal Beaufort. A\r\ncondemnation was from the first a foregone conclusion, and the martyr\r\nwas burned in the old market-place of Rouen on May 28, 1431.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the war had been going on, and the allies had gained little by\r\nthe capture of their most formidable opponent. Even Compiègne held out\r\nsuccessfully [Sidenote: Character of the war.] through a six months’\r\nsiege. An Anglo-Burgundian army was defeated in Champagne, and Philip\r\nwas chagrined to see the prize on which he had confidently reckoned lost\r\nto him for ever. In Normandy the English gained some successes, but\r\nthese were counterbalanced by the loss of Melun. In 1431 hostilities\r\nwere resumed in Champagne, Picardy, Artois, and Burgundy. It would be\r\ntedious and useless to describe the innumerable skirmishes and sieges in\r\nwhich, as a rule, only insignificant forces took part. With the\r\ndisappearance of Jeanne Darc all restraint upon the brutal instincts of\r\nthe soldiers had been removed. Most of the leaders were mercenary\r\nadventurers who fought, not out of devotion to one side or the other,\r\nbut because their followers could only be kept together by plunder. The\r\natrocities committed by the French troops were the greatest obstacle to\r\nthe success of Charles VII. The people were everywhere inclined to\r\nreturn to their allegiance, but they hesitated to trust their lives and\r\nproperty to such defenders. The war was complicated by an important\r\ndispute about the succession in Lorraine. On the death of Charles I. in\r\n1431 the duchy was claimed by his son-in-law, Réné of Anjou, who was\r\nalready duke of Bar. But he was opposed by Antony of Vaudemont, a nephew\r\nof the late duke, who maintained that Lorraine was a male fief. Charles\r\nVII. sent assistance to his brother-in-law, while Philip the Good\r\nespoused the cause of Vaudemont. The Burgundians gained a complete\r\nvictory in July 1431, when Réné was taken prisoner. But the Lorrainers\r\nwere hostile to the count of Vaudemont, and in the end the dispute was\r\ncompromised. Réné recovered his liberty, and his rival withdrew his\r\nclaims to the duchy on condition that his son Frederick should marry\r\nRéné’s daughter, Yolande.\r\n\r\nBedford was fully conscious that the English cause was steadily losing\r\nground in France. He tried to stimulate the loyalty of the Parisians by\r\nbringing over the young Henry VI. to be crowned in Paris. It was his\r\nanswer to the coronation ceremony of Rheims. But it failed to produce\r\nthe desired result. The French were indignant that the chief part in the\r\nceremony was taken by Cardinal Beaufort, and not by a native prelate.\r\nThe common people complained that there was no remission of taxes and no\r\nrelease of prisoners. Even more serious was the growing alienation of\r\nBurgundy. In 1432 occurred the death of Bedford’s wife, Anne [Sidenote:\r\nRupture between Bedford and Burgundy.] of Burgundy. She was popular with\r\nthe Parisians, whereas the regent was not, and she had always been a\r\nmediator between her husband and her brother. To make matters worse,\r\nwithin five months Bedford found a new bride in the person of Jacquetta\r\nof Luxemburg, daughter of the count of St. Pol, and niece of the captor\r\nof Joan of Arc. She was a vassal of Burgundy, and Philip was indignant\r\nthat she should make so important a marriage without his consent.\r\nCardinal Beaufort made vain attempts to effect a reconciliation between\r\nthe two dukes. They were induced to come to St. Omer, but the interview\r\ndid not take place, and the personal quarrel was never healed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile important events were taking place at the court of Charles\r\nVII. The ill-feeling against the omnipotent favourite, La Tremouille,\r\nhad been steadily growing, and the queen’s mother, Yolande of Aragon,\r\norganised a conspiracy for his overthrow. The conspirators acted in\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of La Tremouille.] conjunction with the constable\r\nRichemont, who sent some of his trusty Bretons to aid them, but wisely\r\nabstained from interfering in person. The plot was successful. La\r\nTremouille was surprised in his bed, and was kept in close captivity\r\ntill he had ceased to be formidable. The king was terrified when he\r\nheard the news, but was consoled when he learned that the dreaded\r\nRichemont was not present. It was not till 1434 that Charles consented\r\nto be reconciled to the constable, whose rough exterior and brusque\r\nmeasures against former favourites had outweighed his loyal services to\r\nthe national cause. From this time a new era opened for France. The\r\nRoyal Council was reformed under the guidance of Yolande, and room was\r\nfound in it for some of those bourgeois ministers, to whom was due the\r\nlater reorganisation of the kingdom. Even Charles himself began to show\r\nunwonted energy, a change which unsupported tradition has assigned to\r\nthe influence of his mistress, Agnes Sorel. French historians are never\r\ntired of insisting that France owed its salvation in the fifteenth\r\ncentury to two women, the one a saint and the other a sinner.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel between Bedford and Burgundy and the suppression of feuds\r\nand jealousies at the court of Charles removed the most obvious\r\ndifficulties which had [Sidenote: Treaty of Arras, 1435.] hitherto\r\nimpeded a reconciliation between the French king and Philip the Good.\r\nStrenuous negotiations resulted in an agreement that a congress should\r\nmeet at Arras in July 1435. The English were to be invited to accept\r\nreasonable terms, and if they refused Philip was to do all in his power\r\nto restore peace to the kingdom. The inevitable result of the congress\r\nwas easy to foresee. Beaufort and the English envoys rejected the first\r\nFrench demand that Henry VI. should resign the crown of France, and\r\nquitted Arras. It only remained to arrange matters with Philip, who was\r\nin a position to dictate his own terms. It was the suzerain who sued for\r\npardon and the vassal who granted it. The duke demanded and received the\r\ncounties of Auxerre and Macon in perpetuity for himself and his heirs,\r\nthe towns on the river Somme, which on certain conditions might be\r\nredeemed by the French king, and the recognition of his claims to the\r\ncounty of Boulogne, which had been contested by the heirs of the late\r\nduchess of Berri. In addition, Philip was to be freed from all homage\r\nand subjection to Charles VII. during their common lifetime. If Charles\r\ndied first, Philip was to do homage to his successor; but if Philip died\r\nfirst, his heir would become the vassal of Charles VII. On these\r\nexorbitant conditions Philip agreed to forget all past wrongs, _i.e._\r\nthe death of his father, to which Charles virtually pleaded guilty, and\r\nto enter into a defensive alliance against the English. The treaty,\r\nwhich put an end to the long feud between Burgundians and Armagnacs, was\r\nsigned on September 21, 1435. A week earlier Bedford had died. He had\r\nlived long enough to witness the collapse of the foundation on which the\r\nedifice rested, to whose construction he had devoted all his abilities\r\nand exertions.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix, Genealogical Table H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n               REVIVAL OF THE FRENCH MONARCHY, 1435-1494\r\n\r\n\r\n    English disasters and loss of Paris—Prolongation of war—France\r\n    exhausted and demoralised—Necessity of reform—Ordinance of 1439—The\r\n    _Praguerie_ —Creation of a standing army—Peace party in\r\n    England—-Henry VI. marries Margaret of Anjou—Renewal of war—Conquest\r\n    of Normandy and Guienne—Last years of Charles VII.—Accession of\r\n    Louis XI.—His character and early actions—League of the Public\r\n    Weal—Treaty of Conflans—Charles the Bold and Liége—Louis recovers\r\n    Normandy—Interview at Péronne—Charles of France receives\r\n    Guienne—Relations of France and Burgundy with England—Renewal of war\r\n    between Louis and Charles—Death of the Duke of Guienne—Charles’s\r\n    acquisitions in Germany—Fate of St. Pol—War with the Swiss and death\r\n    of Charles the Bold—Mary of Burgundy marries Maximilian—Treaty of\r\n    Arras—Successes of Louis XI.—Regency of Anne of Beaujeu—Charles\r\n    VIII. marries Anne of Brittany—Question of Naples.\r\n\r\nThe death of Bedford and the treaty of Arras were events of decisive\r\nimportance. The English power in northern [Sidenote: English disasters\r\nin 1435-6.] France had rested upon the Burgundian alliance, which was\r\nnow irretrievably lost. Philip, it is true, had not promised active aid\r\nto Charles VII., and probably intended to observe a profitable\r\nneutrality. But the English were too indignant at his desertion to allow\r\nthis. They insulted his envoys, maltreated his subjects who were\r\nresident in England, and set themselves to inflict all the damage they\r\ncould upon Flemish trade. The result was that not only was Philip forced\r\ninto hostilities with his late allies, but the Flemish citizens,\r\nhitherto the strongest link between him and England, urged on the war\r\nand offered to take the whole burden of it upon themselves. The rupture\r\nwith Burgundy altered both the balance of military force and the\r\nsentiments of the population in the northern provinces. A rising took\r\nplace in Normandy, and even Harfleur, the first conquest of Henry V.,\r\nopened its gates to French troops. Many of the strong places in the Ile\r\nde France were held by Burgundian commanders, and they followed their\r\nduke’s example in going over to Charles VII. In 1436 the constable\r\nRichemont was strong enough to attack Paris. The citizens had been\r\npartisans of Burgundy rather than of England; they had been alienated by\r\nrecent measures of repression; and the French now commanded the\r\nwater-ways by which the normal supplies of food reached the capital. The\r\nfear of famine impelled the [Sidenote: Loss of Paris.] citizens to a\r\ncourse which they were eager to adopt upon other grounds. One of the\r\ngates was opened to the constable, and the populace rose with shouts of\r\n‘Peace! The king and the duke of Burgundy!’ The English garrison, after\r\ntaking refuge in the Bastille, was allowed to depart upon honourable\r\nterms. The parliament and the other sovereign courts returned to their\r\nold abodes, and Paris became once more the capital of France.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Paris seemed to herald the immediate collapse of the English\r\ndominion in France. Yet the general expectation was disappointed, and\r\nthe war went on for another seventeen years. A number of causes combined\r\nto retard the progress of the French arms. The assistance rendered by\r\nthe duke of Burgundy proved far less efficient than had been\r\nanticipated. In the first heat of resentment at the treatment he\r\nreceived from the English, Philip vowed a striking revenge, and in 1436\r\nhe advanced with a large force to the siege of Calais. But his troops\r\nwere mostly Flemings, who had never been very skilful in aggressive\r\nwarfare, and had lost most of their military aptitudes during the\r\ncomparative peace which they had enjoyed under Burgundian rule. The\r\nsiege was abandoned in disorder even before the arrival of Gloucester\r\nwith a relieving force. Philip was deeply chagrined at this humiliating\r\nfailure, and a quarrel with the commune of Bruges diverted his attention\r\nfrom the war and induced him in 1439 to conclude a truce for the\r\nNetherlands with the English. Even more serious than the loss of such a\r\npowerful ally was the exhaustion and demoralisation of France. For\r\nnearly thirty years the country had been the scene of a desolating war\r\nwhich combined the worst horrors of civil strife and foreign invasion,\r\nand added to them some evils which were peculiar to itself. The most\r\nefficient military force on the French side was furnished by the\r\ncompanies of adventurers which had been originally introduced by\r\nArmagnac. The employment of these men proved a curse to France. They\r\nrecognised no authority except that of their own commanders, and their\r\nloyalty to them was only purchased by the plunder which they were\r\nallowed to extort with impartial greed from friend and foe. The horrible\r\ntortures which they inflicted in order to compel the hapless peasants to\r\ndisclose their savings, are among the most revolting incidents of a\r\nperiod in which horrors are the rule rather than the exception. The\r\nsignificant name of _écorcheurs_ or flayers, applied to them by their\r\nvictims, has become almost a technical term. The country was depopulated\r\nas well as despoiled, and the provinces in English occupation were the\r\nworst sufferers. Financial difficulties on both sides were a prominent\r\ncause of the prolongation of the war. Military operations on a large\r\nscale were impossible. So-called battles were mere skirmishes. A force\r\nof 2000 men was an army. Isolated leaders struck a blow here, or\r\ncaptured a town there, merely to keep their soldiers employed and to\r\nobtain booty, but not with the object of gaining any decisive advantage.\r\nTo many of these leaders the termination of the war meant ruin and\r\neffacement, a result which they were by no means eager to hasten.\r\n\r\nIn order to equip France for the final effort that was needed to expel\r\nthe foreign conqueror from her soil, it was necessary to undertake those\r\nadministrative reforms which constitute the real glory of the reign of\r\nCharles VII. [Sidenote: Ministers of Charles VII.] Charles is known in\r\nhistory by the name of ‘_le bien servi_,’ and it is probably to the\r\nministers rather than to the king that the credit of the internal\r\nprogress of France is due. Richemont and Dunois carried out the arduous\r\ntask of transforming the free companies into a disciplined force under\r\nroyal control. The two brothers, Gaspard and Jean Bureau, improved the\r\nFrench artillery till it became the best in Europe, a pre-eminence which\r\nit retained for the rest of the century. But the most famous adviser of\r\nCharles was the merchant of Bourges, Jacques Cœur. He owed his influence\r\nto the great wealth which he acquired by trade with the Levant. Hitherto\r\nthe cities of Italy and the Catalans had been without serious rivals in\r\nthe Mediterranean. Jacques Cœur brought Marseilles into competition with\r\nVenice, Genoa, and Barcelona. His loans to the monarchy enabled Charles\r\nVII. to carry on the war when the exhaustion of the country made it\r\nalmost impossible to fill the exchequer by means of taxation. Charles\r\nrewarded him with the office of _argentier_, or treasurer of the royal\r\nhousehold. In this capacity he took an active part in reforming the\r\nfinancial administration, and especially in restoring the currency which\r\nhad been ruinously debased during the recent disorders.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important single measure of the reign was the\r\n_Ordonnance sur la Gendarmerie_, published by the States-general at\r\nOrleans in 1439. The preamble recites [Sidenote: Ordinance of 1439.]\r\nthat it is made ‘to remedy and put an end to the great excesses and\r\nrobberies committed by the _gens de guerre_, who have long lived and do\r\nnow live upon the people without order or justice.’ In the future no one\r\nis to raise a company without royal licence, and all captains are to be\r\nnominated by the king, who is to fix the number and arms of their\r\nsoldiers. Pillage is expressly forbidden, and jurisdiction over the\r\ntroops is placed in the hands of royal judges. For the payment of the\r\ntroops an important financial innovation is made. The nobles are\r\nforbidden to impose a _taille_ or tallage on their domain, and the\r\n_taille_ is to be a national tax paid to the king. Thus Charles VII.\r\nreceived a revenue of 1,800,000 livres. There was nothing in the\r\nordinance to make this tax permanent, or to give to the king any power\r\nof arbitrarily fixing the amount of the _taille_; but the permanence of\r\nthe _taille_ was held to be involved in the permanence of the military\r\nforce which it was granted to support. And the successors of Charles\r\nVII. held that the right to levy the _taille_ without consent gave them\r\nalso the right to increase it without asking for any fresh grant. The\r\nacquiescence of the French people was due to the sufferings they had\r\ngone through. Worn out by the prolonged war and by the terrible\r\nexactions of the free companies, they were eager to strengthen the hands\r\nof the monarchy to which alone they could look for a restoration of\r\npeace and order. The absolute control of the national force and the\r\nnational revenue, which the action of the States-general of Orleans\r\nallowed the crown to assume, enabled the monarchy to erect a despotism\r\nin France. Englishmen may hold that orderly government and national\r\nindependence were dearly purchased by the sacrifice of all securities\r\nfor constitutional liberty, but it is at least probable that if they had\r\never found themselves in such an evil plight they would have concluded\r\nthe same bargain on the same terms.\r\n\r\nBut though the mass of the people were ready to welcome any addition to\r\nthe royal power, the French nobles were sufficiently keen-sighted to\r\nperceive the dangers [Sidenote: The Praguerie.] which it involved to\r\ntheir hereditary privileges. The ordinance of 1439 expressly deprived\r\nthem of three valued rights: the power of taxing their own domain, the\r\nmaintenance of troops under their own authority, and the carrying on of\r\nprivate war, which was enumerated among the causes of disorder which\r\nmust be suppressed by the royal troops. It was necessary to strike at\r\nonce before the monarchy became too strong. In 1440 a formidable\r\nconspiracy was formed under the leadership of the dukes of Bourbon and\r\nAlençon. Nearly all the great nobles of France were concerned in it,\r\nexcept the duke of Burgundy, who was occupied with his own affairs, and\r\nthe two brothers-in-law of the king, Réné le Bon and Charles of Maine.\r\nEven Dunois allowed himself to be seduced from the royal cause by the\r\ndesire to uphold the interests of his class. La Tremouille emerged from\r\nhis obscurity to seize a last opportunity of injuring the country and\r\noverthrowing the hated constable. In the very forefront of the\r\nconspirators was the dauphin, Louis, who had quarrelled with his father\r\non the ground that his mother was insulted by the ostentatious pomp of\r\nAgnes Sorel, and whose restless ambition demanded a share in the\r\ngovernment. Like many another heir to a throne, Louis found himself as\r\nprince allied with a cause of which as king he became the strenuous\r\nopponent. The ‘Praguerie,’as the rising was called, in allusion to the\r\nrecent disturbances in Bohemia, seemed at first sight to be\r\nirresistible, especially as the captains of the companies joined in the\r\nmovement. But the king showed unexpected energy and decision; the people\r\nrallied to his side, and the selfish coalition against national\r\ninterests broke to pieces. Many of the leaders escaped punishment by\r\nbetraying their associates, and Louis was banished to his province of\r\nDauphiné.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of the Praguerie enabled the government to take the\r\nnecessary steps for carrying out the ordinance of 1439. By 1445 fifteen\r\ncompanies had been [Sidenote: Creation of a standing army.] created,\r\neach under a captain selected by the king. A company contained a hundred\r\nlances, and a lance implied six persons, viz., the man-at-arms, his\r\npage, three archers, and a _coutillier_, a soldier armed with a _coutil_\r\nor dagger worn at the side. Thus the total number of the _gens\r\nd’ordonnance_, as they were called, was nine thousand. Each captain on\r\nappointment had to take the following oath: ‘I promise and swear by God\r\nand Our Lady that I will maintain justice—that I will allow no\r\npillage—that I will unsparingly punish all those under my charge who are\r\nguilty of such offence, and that I will make reparation for the injuries\r\nthat come to my knowledge.’ The _gens d’ordonnance_ were a cavalry\r\nforce, and three years later an ordinance of 1448 instituted a body of\r\ninfantry, the _francs archiers_. Each parish was to equip at the common\r\nexpense a single archer. During peace the cost of his maintenance was\r\nborne by the parish, but when he was on service he was to receive pay\r\nfrom the crown. They were called ‘free’ archers because they were exempt\r\nfrom the _taille_ and other obligations. Besides these troops, the king\r\nhad his Scottish Guard, which had grown up during the intimate\r\nconnection with Scotland in the early years of the reign and received\r\nits final organisation in 1445. There was also an efficient body of\r\nartillerymen and engineers, the creation of the brothers Bureau. That\r\nthese military reforms were admirably suited to their purpose is proved\r\nboth by the complete cessation of complaints about military outrages,\r\nand by the extraordinarily rapid successes of the French troops when\r\nactive hostilities were resumed.\r\n\r\nWhile France was occupied with these reforms and with the ecclesiastical\r\ndisputes connected with the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges (see p. 237),\r\nEngland in [Sidenote: Parties in England.] her turn was becoming more\r\nand more involved in those internal dissensions which developed into the\r\nWars of the Roses. The personal quarrel between Gloucester and Cardinal\r\nBeaufort proved the origin of a lasting party struggle. After the treaty\r\nof Arras, Beaufort and his supporters had seen clearly that the conquest\r\nof France was impossible and had urged the conclusion of peace as the\r\nonly means of preserving a part of the provinces acquired by Henry V.\r\nand Bedford. On the other hand, Gloucester, backed by the unreasoning\r\nsentiment of the mob, had urged the disgrace of surrender and the\r\nnecessity of a dogged prosecution of the war. The strife of parties had\r\nmaterially contributed to relax the efforts of England in the languid\r\nwarfare that went on from 1436 to 1444. In 1441 the peace party had\r\nsecured the release of Charles of Orleans, who had been a prisoner since\r\nthe battle of Agincourt and had found solace during his captivity in the\r\ncomposition of poems which have given him an honourable place in\r\nliterary history. Three years later the Duke of Suffolk, who was\r\ngradually superseding the aged cardinal in the leadership of the party,\r\nsucceeded in arranging a truce for twenty-two months and in negotiating\r\na marriage between Henry VI. and Margaret of Anjou, a daughter of Réné\r\nle Bon and a niece of Charles VII.’s wife. The marriage was solemnised\r\nin 1445, but it was extremely unpopular in England. Not only did\r\nMargaret bring no dowry, but it was part of the bargain that Anjou and\r\nMaine should be handed over to her uncle, Charles of Maine. Anjou had\r\nnever been thoroughly conquered, but Maine had long been in English\r\nhands and they still had a garrison in its capital, Le Mans. Dreading\r\nthe outbreak of popular fury, Suffolk did all in his power to keep the\r\nagreement secret and to postpone its execution. But in 1448, after\r\nseveral prolongations of the truce, the patience of the French was\r\nexhausted, and a small force marched to Le Mans and compelled the\r\nwithdrawal [Sidenote: Renewal of the war, 1449.] of the garrison and the\r\nevacuation of the whole province. The truce was now extended for another\r\ntwo years, but no permanent treaty could be arranged, and a renewal of\r\nhostilities was sooner or later inevitable. France had by this time\r\ncompleted the work of internal reorganisation, while England was\r\nhopelessly unprepared and distracted by factious disputes. Under these\r\ncircumstances it was madness for England to provoke a quarrel. But\r\nSuffolk and the Beauforts were conscious that the surrender of Maine had\r\nalienated public opinion, and hoped by a display of vigour to disarm\r\nopposition. The garrison of Le Mans had been quartered on the border of\r\nNormandy and Brittany. On March 24, 1449, while the truce was still in\r\nforce, these troops attacked and took the Breton town of Fougères. The\r\nact was as ill-timed [Sidenote: Conquest of the English provinces.] as\r\nit was treacherous. Not only did it give Charles VII. a pretext for\r\nrenewing the war, but it alienated the young Francis I. of Brittany, who\r\nhad hitherto maintained an attitude of friendly neutrality. The duke\r\nappealed for aid to his suzerain, and Charles VII. despatched his army\r\nto invade Normandy. The campaign was little more than a triumphal\r\nprogress for the French troops. Within two months more than twenty towns\r\nwere taken. When Rouen was besieged, the citizens rose and shut up the\r\ngarrison in the citadel, where Edmund Beaufort, who commanded, had to\r\nsurrender (October 19, 1449). By the end of the year the English had\r\nlost the whole of Normandy except a few places on the coast, which were\r\nall taken in the course of 1450. In England these sudden and unexpected\r\nreverses excited a storm of indignation. Adam de Moleyns, bishop of\r\nChichester, was assassinated at Portsmouth. Suffolk was impeached,\r\nexiled by the king, and murdered at sea. The rising of Jack Cade was\r\nonly a prominent symptom of the prevalent discontent. The duke of York\r\ncame over from Ireland, and civil war was on the verge of breaking out.\r\nBut domestic disturbances, however justified by previous misgovernment,\r\nwere ill calculated to assist the defence of the French provinces. From\r\nNormandy the French turned their attention to Guienne, and the campaign\r\nin the south was as rapid and successful as that in the north. On August\r\n26, 1451, Bayonne surrendered, and the English held nothing in France\r\nexcept Calais and the adjacent forts of Guines and Ham. It is true that\r\nthe long commercial intercourse with England and the recollection of the\r\nlenity of English rule as compared with that of Charles VII. led to a\r\nrising in Bordeaux in 1452, and an English force under the veteran\r\nTalbot was sent to take advantage of the opportunity. But Talbot was\r\ndefeated and slain at the battle of Castillon (July 17, 1453), and\r\nBordeaux was soon afterwards compelled to capitulate.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the glory reflected upon Charles VII. by the restoration of\r\nunity, independence, and comparative order to his kingdom, his later\r\nyears were the reverse of happy. The gloomy suspicion which he had\r\n[Sidenote: Later years of Charles VII.] contracted in his troubled youth\r\nbecame a settled habit as he grew old. He shut himself up from the eyes\r\nof his subjects with the obscure mistresses who became his companions\r\nafter the death of Agnes Sorel in 1450. To his loyal minister, Jacques\r\nCœur, he showed the same cynical ingratitude as he had formerly\r\ndisplayed to Joan of Arc. There were plenty of courtiers who were\r\njealous of the influence of the merchant whose wealth made the phrase\r\n‘rich as Jacques Cœur’ almost a proverbial expression. All sorts of\r\ncharges, ranging from malversation to the poisoning of Agnes Sorel, were\r\ntrumped up to procure his ruin. His property was confiscated, and after\r\na trial in which the evidence was ludicrously unconvincing, the sentence\r\nof death was commuted by royal clemency to perpetual imprisonment. From\r\nhis prison he escaped to Italy, and was appointed by Nicolas V.\r\ncommander of the papal galleys in the projected war against the Turks.\r\nBut he died in 1456 before he had any opportunity of winning distinction\r\nin this novel capacity.\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest trouble of Charles VII. in the later part of his\r\nreign arose out of his quarrel with his elder son Louis. After the\r\nsuppression of the Praguerie a temporary [Sidenote: Quarrel with the\r\ndauphin.] reconciliation took place, and the dauphin returned to court.\r\nBut Charles was intensely suspicious of his son, and in 1446 the alleged\r\ndiscovery of a new conspiracy induced him to banish Louis once more to\r\nDauphiné. From this time the quarrel became irreconcilable, and father\r\nand son never met again. For the next ten years Louis set himself to\r\nrule his appanage as if it were an independent principality. He erected\r\na parliament of his own at Grenoble and a university at Valence. His\r\ncourt became the refuge of all malcontents against the royal government.\r\nTo strengthen himself against his father he concluded a close alliance\r\nwith the duke of Savoy, and married his daughter Charlotte. So notorious\r\nwas the quarrel that the Pope and the kings of Aragon and Castile\r\nproffered their mediation, but in vain. At last, in 1456, Charles\r\ndespatched Dammartin with an army to compel the submission of Dauphiné.\r\nLouis had no adequate military force of his own, his father-in-law\r\ndeclined to run the risk of assisting him, and he fled to Franche-Comté\r\nand threw himself upon the protection of the duke of Burgundy. Philip\r\nreceived him with great pomp in Brabant, and assigned to him a residence\r\nat Genappe, where he remained for the next five years.\r\n\r\nSince the treaty of Arras and the futile siege of Calais, Philip the\r\nGood had taken little part in the affairs of France. He had allowed the\r\nPraguerie to be put down, [Sidenote: Relations with Burgundy.] and the\r\nEnglish to be expelled from France, without stirring to the aid of\r\neither, although the aggrandisement of the French monarchy was obviously\r\ndangerous to himself. His absorbing interest during these years was the\r\ngovernment and extension of the heterogeneous dominions which had come\r\nunder his rule. The Flemish citizens found it difficult to defend their\r\nliberties against a ruler who could employ against them the resources of\r\nso many other provinces. A rising in Bruges in 1437 was suppressed with\r\ngreat severity. In 1448 a more serious rebellion broke out in Ghent, and\r\nthe citizens appealed for aid to Charles VII. But the French king was\r\nprevented from interfering by the renewal of the English war, and the\r\nGantois were left unaided to conduct a heroic resistance against\r\noverwhelming odds. It was not till 1453 that a crushing defeat at the\r\nbattle of Gavre compelled them to submit, and even then the duke granted\r\nfairly moderate terms to such formidable opponents. This victory was\r\nfollowed by the acquisition of Luxemburg, which Philip finally acquired\r\non the death of his aunt Elizabeth, in opposition to the strong legal\r\nclaims of Ladislas Postumus, whose mother was a daughter of the emperor\r\nSigismund. In spite of the extent and wealth of his dominions, Philip\r\nwas conscious of two serious elements of weakness. There was no social\r\nor political unity between the various provinces, which were held\r\ntogether only by subjection to a common ruler. And, geographically, they\r\nwere split into two distinct units. Between the Netherlands and the two\r\nBurgundies lay the provinces of Champagne and Lorraine, over which the\r\nduke had no legal authority. He could not travel from his northern\r\ncapital at Brussels to his southern residence at Dijon without having to\r\npass through foreign and possibly hostile territories.\r\n\r\nCharles VII. was fully conscious of the danger involved to the French\r\nmonarchy in the erection of a practically independent state on the\r\neastern and north-eastern frontiers of France. His suzerainty over the\r\nFrench fiefs of Philip was suspended during the latter’s lifetime by the\r\ntreaty of Arras, and even when it should be revived by his own death or\r\nthat of the duke, it would be of little use against a vassal who was\r\nstrong enough to defy his overlord. The most pressing danger was the\r\noccupation by Philip of the strongest places in Picardy, which brought\r\nhim into dangerous proximity to Paris. Twice Charles endeavoured to\r\nexercise the power of redeeming the towns on the Somme which had been\r\nreserved in the treaty of Arras, but both times he had to put up with a\r\nrebuff. An open struggle between France and the Burgundian power was,\r\nsooner or later, inevitable, but Charles was too weary of warfare to\r\nallow it to break out during his reign. Even when the duke gave such an\r\nostentatious welcome to the rebellious dauphin, the king refused to\r\ndepart from his policy of peace. But he showed a grim sense of humour\r\nwhen he heard of the reception of his restless and ambitious son in\r\nBrussels. Philip, he said, ‘is nourishing the fox who will one day\r\ndevour his chickens.’\r\n\r\nThe dauphin was still at Genappe when the news reached him that his\r\nfather had died on July 22, 1461. It was said that Charles was so\r\nterrified of being poisoned in [Sidenote: Accession of Louis XI.] his\r\nfood that he starved himself to death; and it is quite possible that his\r\nsuspicious timidity was a trait of insanity inherited from the\r\nunfortunate Charles VI. Louis lost no time in setting out to take\r\npossession of his kingdom, and he was accompanied by his Burgundian host\r\nand champion. At the coronation ceremony at Rheims, and in the formal\r\nentry into Paris, Philip played the most prominent part. It is true\r\nthat, in accordance with the treaty of Arras, he did homage to the new\r\nking for his French fiefs, but under the circumstances the homage seemed\r\nalmost ironical. In the eyes of the people the duke was the powerful\r\npatron and protector, while his nominal suzerain appeared as his\r\ngrateful dependant. Louis was still looked upon as the leader of the\r\nPraguerie, as the rebel lord of Dauphiné, as the fugitive guest in the\r\ndominions of the duke of Burgundy; and his first acts seemed to accord\r\nwith the principles which had guided his conduct in the past. He gave\r\nthe duchy of Berri as an appanage to his younger brother Charles. To\r\nPhilip’s son and heir, Charles of Charolais, he granted the government\r\nof the all-important province of Normandy. The duke of Brittany received\r\nthe government of the district between the Lower Seine and the Loire.\r\nThe faithful servants of his father, such as Dunois and Dammartin, were\r\ndismissed, and the latter was imprisoned. The offices thus left vacant\r\nwere conferred upon men who had supported the dauphin against the late\r\nking. It seemed as if the feudal nobles of France had at last found a\r\nking who would govern in their interests rather than in those of the\r\ncrown. The history of the reign is the record of their bitter\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nLouis XI. is perhaps the most familiar figure in the history of the\r\nfifteenth century. His character has been painted for all time by\r\nPhilippe de Commines; and his portrait has been described for English\r\nreaders by Sir Walter Scott. He is the model prince of the new type, the\r\nastute pupil of that [Sidenote: Character and policy of Louis XI.]\r\nItalian statecraft which Machiavelli drew up in a systematic treatise.\r\nHe was, according to Chastellain, ‘the universal spider’; his intrigues\r\nformed a vast web with himself at the centre. No consideration of\r\nmorality, pride, or mercy was allowed to interfere with the attainment\r\nof his ends. His industry was unceasing, and he had a wonderful insight\r\ninto the weaker side of human nature. ‘No one ever took more trouble to\r\ngain over a man who might do him either service or injury.’ His one\r\nweakness was a caustic tongue, and he acknowledged that his indulgence\r\nof this unruly member frequently brought him into scrapes. He was\r\nnaturally suspicious and mistrustful; he would listen to advice, but\r\nfollow his own counsel; his ministers must be his tools; independence\r\nwas treachery in his eyes. He forgot nothing, and forgave nothing, but\r\nhe could dissimulate even his anger. His policy has been equally clearly\r\nportrayed for us. He was, in the words of Commines, ‘the enemy of all\r\ngreat men, whose power might surpass his own, and he was naturally the\r\nfriend of men of low estate.’ But this phrase must not be misunderstood.\r\nLouis XI. did not depress the nobles in order to exalt the lower classes\r\nor to extend their liberty. Municipal independence was as hateful to him\r\nas aristocratic privilege. Everything was to be equally subject to the\r\ncrown. The great achievement of his reign was the victory of\r\ncentralisation over the tendencies to disintegration in France.\r\nIndividual members of the bourgeois class were his favourite\r\ninstruments; for the class itself he did nothing, except so far as the\r\npeople were better off under a strong monarchy than under the rule of a\r\nselfish and divided noble caste.\r\n\r\nCommines tells us that Louis XI. was ‘the wisest king at recovering from\r\na false step,’ and at the beginning of his reign false steps were not\r\ninfrequent. In the [Sidenote: Louis’ first measures.] first\r\nconsciousness of the authority which he had long coveted, he made many\r\npowerful enemies by his restless activity, and did not stop to consider\r\nthe danger to which their combined hostility might expose him. The\r\nvengeful spirit with which he began his reign soon gave way to the\r\nresolute purpose of increasing his power. Instead of conciliating the\r\npeople by the expected remission of taxes, he imposed a new charge upon\r\nthe sale of wines. To the great indignation of the clergy he annulled\r\nthe Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges, which, for the last twenty-three\r\nyears, had given a large measure of independence to the Gallican Church.\r\nYet his strong sense of his own authority prevented him from restoring\r\nto the papacy its former powers, and ecclesiastical anarchy prevailed\r\nduring the rest of his reign. The Roman Curia treated the Pragmatic\r\nSanction as null and void, whereas the Parliament of Paris acted as if\r\nit were still in force, and the king regulated his conduct according to\r\nhis varying need to conciliate either the papacy or his own subjects.\r\n\r\nBut the chief dissatisfaction with the rule of Louis was felt by the\r\nnobles. An edict which declared hunting to be a domain right of the\r\ncrown, and prohibited [Sidenote: Alienation of the nobles.] private\r\npreserves as illegal, excited intense ill-feeling among men to whom the\r\nchase was not only the chief occupation of their lives, but also a badge\r\nof their rank. And the greater princes had special grievances. The duke\r\nof Bourbon was deprived of the government of Guienne which he had\r\nmis-used. With the duke of Brittany the king quarrelled on the old\r\ngrounds as to the homage due for the duchy and the extent of the ducal\r\nrights to the revenue of vacant benefices. Francis II. opened\r\nnegotiations with Edward IV., and tried to renew the Anglo-Burgundian\r\nalliance. On discovering these plans, Louis was compelled, in\r\nself-defence, to withdraw the government of Normandy from Charles of\r\nCharolais. At the same time, in order to render Charles’s hostility\r\nimpotent, and to strengthen the crown against the prince whose patronage\r\nhe resented even while he had profited by it, Louis set himself to\r\nfoment domestic disturbances at the court of Burgundy. During his five\r\nyears of exile he had established intimate relations with Philip the\r\nGood’s favourite ministers, Antony of Croy and his brother John of\r\nChimay. The growing ascendency of these men and the suspicion that they\r\nwere allied with and possibly in the pay of the French king, roused the\r\nanimosity of Charles of Charolais, who quarrelled so fiercely with his\r\nfather on the subject that he quitted Brussels and took up his residence\r\nin Holland. His absence enabled [Sidenote: Quarrel with Charles the\r\nBold.] Louis, with the help of the Croy brothers, to induce Philip to\r\nallow the redemption of the Somme towns for the stipulated 400,000\r\ncrowns. Charles was more furious than ever at the curtailment of his\r\ninheritance and the strengthening of the French frontier at his expense.\r\nIn 1464 events enabled him to turn the tables on his opponents. A report\r\nwas spread that an emissary of Louis had plotted to kidnap Charles in\r\nHolland, and though there was probably no foundation for the story, it\r\nserved to bring about a partial reconciliation between Philip and his\r\nson. Louis XI. sent an embassy to Brabant to denounce the untruth, and\r\nto demand the surrender of its author, but the Chancellor of France used\r\nsuch peremptory language that Philip’s pride was roused, and not only\r\nwas the demand refused, but the Croy favourites, who were identified\r\nwith French interests, were disgraced and expelled from the court.\r\nPhilip himself was now old and feeble, and allowed the reins of\r\ngovernment to fall into the hands of his impetuous son, whom\r\ncontemporaries and posterity have agreed to call Charles the Bold or the\r\nRash. This was a serious defeat for the plans of Louis. Charles was more\r\nof an independent prince than a vassal of France, but in both capacities\r\nit was his interest to weaken the French monarchy by encouraging the\r\nfeudal independence of the great nobles. The policy which he pursued for\r\nthe next few years is clearly expressed in his own phrase: ‘Instead of\r\none king of France I would like to see six!’\r\n\r\nIn 1465 the adhesion of Burgundy emboldened the princes of the lilies to\r\ntake active measures against the monarchy. The most prominent organiser\r\nof the conspiracy was the duke of Bourbon, who acted as negotiator\r\n[Sidenote: The war of the Public Weal, 1465.] between the two most\r\npowerful associates, the duke of Brittany and Charles the Bold. The\r\nsignal for concerted action was the flight to Brittany of Charles of\r\nBerri, a youth of nineteen, who was to take the part which Louis himself\r\nhad played in the Praguerie. At the court of Francis were assembled\r\nDunois and most of the other servants of Charles VII. whom Louis had too\r\nhastily dismissed. A sort of open letter or manifesto was drafted in the\r\nname of the duke of Berri and addressed to Philip of Burgundy. In it the\r\nconfederates denounced the oppressive rule of Louis as injurious to the\r\nwelfare of the people; and this profession of public spirit to cover\r\nprivate aims was sufficient to give them the name of the ‘League of the\r\nPublic Weal.’ Louis had for some time been conscious of the approach of\r\ndanger, and had sought to strengthen himself against it. The duke of\r\nSavoy was his brother-in-law, and the aid of Francesco Sforza was\r\npurchased by the cession of Genoa. This, however, ruined the Angevin\r\ncause in Naples, and John of Calabria, eager for vengeance, brought\r\nItalian and Swiss mercenaries to the aid of the league. In England,\r\nwhich could render more efficient aid than any other power, Louis’\r\nscheme met with failure. He had gained over Warwick, the apparently\r\nall-powerful king-maker, and hoped, with his help, to induce Edward IV.\r\nto form a marriage alliance with France. But Edward preferred the charms\r\nof Elizabeth Woodville, a niece of the count of St. Pol, who was\r\nmarshalling the forces of Burgundy for an invasion of Picardy, and this\r\nmarriage was a blow to the influence of Warwick and the interests of\r\nLouis. The king found himself almost isolated in France. His old\r\nprovince of Dauphiné was loyal to him, and his uncle, Charles of Maine,\r\nundertook to oppose the rebels on the border of Brittany. In Paris, too,\r\nhe had conciliated the citizens, but most of the towns were passively\r\nwaiting to see which side would prove the stronger. In these\r\ncircumstances Louis felt that it would be dangerous to stake everything\r\non the devotion of his capital, and instead of waiting to be attacked he\r\ndetermined to take the offensive. Some of the royal troops preferred to\r\nsupport their local overlords, but the great mass of them were loyal to\r\nthe crown, and the possession of a trained and well-equipped force was\r\nthe one advantage which the king possessed over his enemies who had to\r\ncollect hasty levies from among their vassals. His first march was\r\nagainst the duke of Bourbon, as the most resolute and the most central\r\nof his opponents, and he had already made considerable progress when he\r\nwas recalled by the news that Charles the Bold, at the head of his\r\nfather’s forces, was threatening Paris. Louis hoped to enter the capital\r\nwithout a contest, but chance or treachery brought the two armies so\r\nclose together that a collision was inevitable. The battle of Montlhéri\r\nwas a confused skirmish in which no military capacity was displayed on\r\neither side. The left wing of each army routed its immediate opponents,\r\nand thus neutralised each other’s success. The Count of Charolais\r\nclaimed the victory on the ground that his troops were left in\r\noccupation of the field, but he had suffered the greater losses, and the\r\nonly tangible result was obtained by the king, who entered Paris two\r\ndays later. Soon afterwards the arrival of Berri and Brittany from the\r\nnorth-west and of John of Calabria from the south-east gave the princes\r\nan apparently overwhelming superiority of numbers. But they were divided\r\nby mutual jealousies and by the selfishness of their several aims, and\r\nthus concerted action was rendered impossible. The urgent necessity of\r\nincreasing his forces and of securing the valleys of the Seine, Marne,\r\nand Yonne, by which Paris was provisioned, compelled Louis to make an\r\nexpedition to Normandy. By so doing he ran a very serious risk of losing\r\nParis, but the citizens refused to listen to the specious offers of the\r\nprinces, and the king returned with 12,000 troops and a supply of\r\nprovisions. Following the advice of Francesco Sforza, he sought to\r\ndivide his opponents by separate negotiations. But there was one demand,\r\nthat he should give the government of Normandy to Charles of Berri,\r\nwhich he persistently refused to grant. Not only was the province one of\r\nthe largest and wealthiest of the kingdom, but in the hands of his\r\nbrother it would serve to connect the two most powerful malcontents,\r\nBrittany and Burgundy, and the three together could reduce Paris to such\r\nstraits that they would be able to dictate terms to the king. But while\r\nthis difficulty proved a stumbling-block in the way of the negotiations,\r\nthe news came that Rouen had been treacherously surrendered to his\r\nopponents. Louis at once decided that, the mischief being done, it was\r\nbetter to put an end to the present war and to trust to future\r\nopportunities for a chance of recovering his losses. In October the\r\ntreaty was drawn up [Sidenote: Treaty of Conflans.] at Conflans and\r\nfinally signed at St. Maur des Fossés. ‘The public weal was changed into\r\nindividual weal,’ and no attempt was made to carry out the professions\r\nwhich the princes had put forward at the outset. The Pragmatic Sanction,\r\nwith regard to which the king’s conduct was most obviously indefensible,\r\nwas not even mentioned. The most important provisions were the\r\nrestoration of the Somme towns to Burgundy, with the provision that they\r\nshould not be again redeemed till after the death of Charles and his\r\nimmediate heir, and the cession of Normandy to Charles of Berri. But\r\nnearly every member of the league received some concession. The duke of\r\nBrittany was to have Montfort and Étampes, and his claims to sovereign\r\nrights, with regard to ecclesiastical revenues, were allowed. St. Pol\r\nwas to be constable, John of Calabria was to have certain cessions in\r\nLorraine and money for the maintenance of troops to support the Angevin\r\ncause, and the dispossessed officials of Charles VII. were to recover\r\ntheir places. The princes of the lilies seemed to have won a complete\r\nvictory over the monarchy.\r\n\r\nBut Louis knew that he had only to bide his time. The very completeness\r\nof their success dissolved the bonds that held the confederates\r\ntogether. United they were irresistible, but if they could be severed\r\nfrom each other the king could hope to regain what he had lost. Even\r\nduring the siege of Paris his shrewd eye had been keen to detect the\r\nnascent jealousies which were to give him the desired opportunity for\r\nrevenge. Already his intrigues had provided an occupation for the forces\r\nof Burgundy. In the heart [Sidenote: Risings in Liége.] of the\r\nNetherlands lay the ecclesiastical principality of Liége, ruled by its\r\nbishop as a vassal of the empire. Annexation was impossible, and\r\ngeography made complete independence equally out of the question. Liége\r\nwas famous then as it is now for its iron manufactures, and the\r\nprosperous artisans, the most democratic community in mediæval Europe,\r\nwere in constant revolt against episcopal rule. It was the policy of the\r\nBurgundian dukes to maintain a hold over the bishop by supporting him\r\nagainst his rebellious subjects, and the present bishop, Louis of\r\nBourbon, was a dissolute youth wholly subservient to his uncle, Philip\r\nthe Good, to whom he owed his mitre. On the other hand, the citizens\r\nlooked for aid to France, which was the chief market for their produce.\r\nAs soon as the war began, Louis had taken measures to organise a revolt\r\nin Liége, which broke out on the arrival of a false report that the\r\nBurgundian troops had been completely routed at Montlhéri. Dinant, the\r\nsecond town of the principality, incurred the special displeasure of\r\nPhilip by hanging over the walls an effigy of Charles of Charolais with\r\nan inscription declaring him to be a bastard. Directly after the treaty\r\nof Conflans, Charles led his troops into Liége to put down disorder and\r\nto punish this insult. But the season was too far advanced for active\r\noperations, and after forcing upon Liége the ‘piteous peace,’ by which\r\nthe cause of Dinant was abandoned and the liberties of the city\r\ncurtailed, Charles dispersed his forces for the winter. In 1466 the\r\ninvasion was renewed, and the aged duke, Philip, accompanied the army in\r\nperson to enjoy the luxury of revenge. Dinant was taken and razed to the\r\nground, and the men of Liége, roused by the sufferings of their\r\nneighbours to a tardy breach of the recent treaty, were compelled to\r\nrenew their submission, to pay a heavy fine, and to hand over fifty\r\nleading citizens as hostages for their good faith. In spite of these\r\nreverses they retained their obstinate antipathy to external control and\r\ntheir confident expectation of assistance from France. In 1467 Charles\r\nthe Bold, who had become duke of Burgundy by his father’s death on June\r\n15, led what had now become an annual expedition for the attack on\r\nLiége. Under the walls of St. Tron an obstinate battle ended in a\r\nvictory for the Burgundians. Liége might still have stood a siege, but\r\nthe citizens, divided and cowed, agreed to capitulate. The walls were\r\nlevelled to the ground, and the free constitution of the city was\r\nannulled. So impressive was Charles’s success, that Ghent, which had won\r\nincreased privileges by a rising on the occasion of his ‘joyous entry,’\r\nhastened to appease him by a timely submission. It seemed for a moment\r\nthat the champion of feudal independence in France might succeed in\r\nestablishing despotic government within his own territories.\r\n\r\nWhile Charles was engaged in his first campaign against Liége, Louis had\r\nseized the opportunity to recover the most serious of his losses. As\r\nsoon as the treaty of [Sidenote: Louis recovers Normandy.] Conflans had\r\nbeen concluded, the dukes of Berri and Brittany had set out together to\r\ntake possession of Normandy. But the triumphant confederates quarrelled\r\nover the division of the spoil. The feeble Charles of Berri resented the\r\npatronage and pretensions of his ally, who claimed for his own subjects\r\nthe most valuable places in the duchy. Louis took prompt advantage of\r\nthe dispute. He concluded a treaty with the indignant Francis of\r\nBrittany at Caen, and despatched the royal troops to Rouen. The province\r\nwas recovered as rapidly as it had been lost, and the two duke—‘wise\r\nafter the event’—made up their differences and set themselves in\r\nBrittany to devise means for regaining what they had forfeited by their\r\nown folly. They made urgent appeals for aid to Edward IV. of England and\r\nto Burgundy, and Louis was fully alive to the danger of such a\r\ncoalition. He had two trump cards to play in the intricate negotiations\r\nwhich followed. In England he had gained over the earl of Warwick, and\r\nWarwick, though his influence was waning, and he was unable to prevent\r\nthe marriage of Charles the Bold with Margaret of York, was yet strong\r\nenough to avert for a time any active intervention of England in\r\nopposition to France. And Louis, as we have seen, was able to hamper the\r\naction of Burgundy by stirring up disaffection in Liége. His supreme\r\nobject was to keep Burgundy and Brittany apart, and he constantly\r\noffered to abandon the cause of the Liégeois if Charles would give him a\r\nfree hand in dealing with the dukes of Brittany and Berri. But Charles\r\nthe Bold was too astute to approve of so one-sided a bargain, and Louis\r\nwas forced to adopt another ruse. In 1468 he bribed his brother and duke\r\nFrancis to conclude a separate treaty, without consulting Burgundy, and\r\nthen he promptly communicated the fact of their desertion to Charles. He\r\nwas confident that Charles’s indignation would impel him to punish them\r\nby a similar abandonment, and when his envoys failed to conduct the\r\nnegotiations to a successful issue he determined to try his own powers\r\nof diplomacy. The experienced politicians of Europe were astounded to\r\nhear that the French king had obtained an unconditional safe-conduct\r\nfrom his vassal, and had ventured with a wholly inadequate escort to run\r\nthe risk of a personal [Sidenote: Interview at Péronne.] interview at\r\nPéronne. But in his own self-confidence and his contempt for the ability\r\nof his rival, Louis had made another ‘false step.’ He had completely\r\nforgotten that his emissaries were at the moment engaged in rekindling\r\nthe smouldering embers of rebellion in Liége. While he was still the\r\nduke’s guest at Péronne, the news arrived that the citizens had seized\r\nthe bishop, and had barbarously murdered several members of the chapter.\r\nCharles was so furious that his more prudent advisers had great\r\ndifficulty in dissuading him from laying violent hands upon his\r\nsuzerain. Louis’s father had been held responsible for the murder of a\r\nduke of Burgundy; and it might well have been that the duke’s grandson\r\nwould not shrink from the death of a king of France. Louis could only\r\nescape from his perilous position by agreeing to all the terms dictated\r\nby the host who was now his gaoler. He had to incur the ignominy of\r\naccompanying the Burgundian army in a fourth expedition against Liége,\r\nand to take part in the destruction of a city whose chief fault was a\r\ntoo implicit confidence in his own promises of support. If Charles had\r\ndemanded the restoration of Normandy to the duke of Berri, Louis could\r\nhardly have refused. But the duke of Burgundy had not yet forgotten the\r\naction of Brittany earlier in the year, and he was more anxious to\r\nstrengthen himself than to weaken the French king by renewing the old\r\nleague against him. Instead of Normandy, he demanded the cession to the\r\nking’s brother of Champagne and Brie. Isolated from Brittany, Charles of\r\nBerri could hardly fail to become the tool of Burgundy; and, in the\r\nhands of a submissive ally, these provinces would serve to connect the\r\nNetherlands with the original Burgundian possessions. Louis perforce\r\nconsented; but before he escaped from the toils, his quick mind had\r\nalready discovered a means of evading the danger. At his parting\r\ninterview with Charles he put forward as a casual suggestion that his\r\nbrother might decline the proffered appanage, and asked what he should\r\ndo. Charles replied, without thought, that in that case he must leave\r\nthe king to satisfy the duke. Louis took these hasty words as authority\r\nto make an independent bargain. No sooner was he safe within his own\r\nrealm than he offered his brother the duchy of Guienne. Guienne was a\r\nfar more wealthy and important province than Champagne, and in itself\r\nwas a greater loss to the crown; but, on the other hand, it was far\r\nremoved from the two dangerous opponents of the crown—the dukes of\r\nBurgundy and Brittany—and Louis knew that his brother, by himself, was\r\nnot likely to be formidable. The bribe was accepted, and thus the most\r\nimportant provision of the treaty of Péronne was never carried into\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of Guienne for Champagne freed Louis from the worst\r\nconsequences of his ill-timed visit to Péronne, but it did little or\r\nnothing to remove the great standing difficulties in his way. Burgundy\r\nand Brittany were as powerful and as independent as ever. They could\r\nreckon on the support of all the feudal nobles in France who wished to\r\nlimit the authority of the crown. Worst of all, they could call in the\r\naid of the Yorkist king of England, who had recently proved his complete\r\nestrangement from France by giving his sister in marriage to Charles the\r\nBold. It was obviously of immense importance to Louis [Sidenote:\r\nRelations of France and Burgundy with England.] to secure himself from\r\ndanger on the side of England, and for the moment events seemed to\r\nfavour his schemes. Warwick was now completely estranged from Edward\r\nIV., and Clarence, the latter’s brother, had joined the king-maker and\r\nhad married his elder daughter, Isabel Neville. But Edward was still too\r\nstrong for his opponents, and in 1470 Warwick and Clarence had to seek\r\nrefuge in France. Louis seized the opportunity to effect a\r\nreconciliation between his cousin, Margaret of Anjou, and the man who\r\nhad done more than any other to ruin the Lancastrian cause. Warwick’s\r\nsecond daughter, Anne, was married to the ill-fated Edward, titular\r\nprince of Wales, and the former champion of the Yorkists undertook to\r\nrestore the house of Lancaster. Such an extraordinary and unexpected\r\ncoalition effected an easy revolution in England. Henry VI. emerged from\r\nhis prison to play, for a few more months, the part of king; and Edward\r\nIV. sought safety and assistance in the dominions of his brother-in-law.\r\nCharles the Bold found himself placed by these events in an awkward\r\ndilemma. Descended through his mother from John of Gaunt, he had long\r\nposed as a supporter of the Lancastrian cause, and had sheltered at his\r\ncourt many of the leading nobles of that party. Recent events had forced\r\nhim into an alliance with Edward IV., but it had been dictated by policy\r\nrather than by good-will. If the restoration of Henry VI. were\r\npermanent, Charles could hope to gain such support among the Lancastrian\r\nnobles as would secure him against the French proclivities of Warwick\r\nand Margaret of Anjou. On the other hand, Edward was his wife’s brother;\r\nhe was a refugee in the Burgundian province of Holland; to disown him\r\nwould put an end to all hope of English assistance in the event of\r\nEdward recovering his crown. Charles escaped from the dilemma in a\r\nmanner characteristic of the age. Publicly he protested his devotion to\r\nthe house of Lancaster, but secretly he gave Edward sufficient\r\nassistance to enable him to return to England. The desertion of\r\nClarence, who had no interest in restoring the Lancastrian dynasty, and\r\nthe ill-concealed enmity with which the Lancastrian partisans continued\r\nto regard Warwick, gave Edward successive victories over the two\r\nsections of the hostile coalition. At Barnet, the Nevilles were crushed\r\nand Warwick slain (April 14, 1471), and three weeks later Margaret and\r\nher immediate followers met with a fatal reverse at Tewkesbury. The\r\ndeaths of the prince of Wales and his father left the house of Lancaster\r\nalmost extinct, except for a solitary scion of the illegitimate line of\r\nBeaufort, and the permanence of the Yorkist dynasty, with its numerous\r\nmale representatives, seemed to be assured.\r\n\r\nThe decisive victory of Edward IV. was a blow to Louis XI., and it was\r\nthe more serious because in 1470 he had become involved in new\r\nhostilities with Charles the Bold. [Sidenote: The Constable St. Pol.]\r\nThis was in great measure due to the Count of St. Pol, who had been an\r\ninfluential personage at the French court ever since the war of the\r\nPublic Weal. His position was in many ways an extraordinary one. For his\r\nhereditary estates he was a vassal of Charles the Bold, and the bulk of\r\nthese estates lay in or near the province of Picardy, the very frontier\r\nwhere the rivalry between French and Burgundian interests was most\r\nacute. As Constable he was a servant of the French king and the chief\r\ncommander of the standing forces of the crown. The incongruity of such a\r\ndouble relation had been clearly shown in recent events. In 1466 St. Pol\r\nhad taken part as a Burgundian vassal in the campaign against Dinant and\r\nLiége. In the next year he had headed the French embassy which had\r\nsuggested the abandonment of Liége by Louis as the price of Charles’s\r\nseverance from Brittany. The importance and the anomaly of the\r\nconstable’s position were both increased by his own marriage with Mary\r\nof Savoy, Louis XI.’s sister-in-law, and by the marriage of his niece,\r\nElizabeth Woodville, to Edward IV. of England. It was the ambition of\r\nSt. Pol to play the part of an independent potentate in the politics of\r\nEurope, and he conceived that the best way to do this was to prolong the\r\nstrife between France and Burgundy. Not only did the war increase his\r\npower and importance as constable of France, but it also enabled him,\r\nthrough the position of his own estates, to hold a sort of balancing\r\nposition between the two opponents. Both might hate and fear him, but it\r\nwas in the highest degree unlikely that they would combine against him;\r\nand as both must bid for his support, it was in his power to make his\r\nown terms with either side as interest and policy should dictate.\r\nAccordingly, in 1470, he persuaded Louis to strike a blow for the\r\nrecovery of the Somme towns, and in the king’s name he took possession\r\nof Amiens and St. Quentin. Charles the Bold was [Sidenote: Renewed war\r\nbetween France and Burgundy.] taken by surprise, and the want of a\r\nstanding army always made it difficult for him to meet any sudden move\r\non the part of the French king. He was naturally indignant that the blow\r\nshould be dealt by one of his own vassals, and his anger was by no means\r\ndiminished when he received a message from St. Pol and his associates\r\nthat they would desert to his side if he would marry his daughter Mary\r\nto Charles of Guienne. Charles had no desire to give up his daughter,\r\nwhose hand was a valuable asset in his diplomacy, and he had no\r\nintention of submitting to coercion in the choice of a son-in-law. His\r\nobstinacy compelled the constable and the confederate nobles to remain\r\noutwardly loyal to the king, though their real aim was to reduce the\r\nduke to such straits that he must accept their terms. An attempt on the\r\npart of Charles to recover Amiens ended in failure, and the critical\r\nstruggle in England led to a truce in April 1471, by which the captured\r\ntowns were left in the king’s hands. The Yorkist victory seemed likely\r\nto turn the balance in favour of Burgundy, but, fortunately for Louis,\r\nEdward IV. was resolutely hostile to the marriage project put forward by\r\nthe French princes. It is true that a dauphin had been born in 1470, but\r\nhe was a sickly child, and if he died the duke of Guienne would once\r\nmore become heir to the throne, and the possible absorption of the vast\r\nBurgundian inheritance by the French monarchy would be ruinous to\r\nEnglish interests and ambition. Sooner than allow such a union to be\r\neffected Edward would abandon Burgundy and join Louis. But Louis was\r\ndiscouraged by the failure of his English policy. He knew that he could\r\nnot trust the loyalty of his instruments, and he preferred diplomacy to\r\nthe renewal of a war in which there was little prospect of assured gain.\r\nSo for six months he negotiated with Charles, offering to restore Amiens\r\nand St. Quentin and to abandon St. Pol to the vengeance of his injured\r\nsuzerain, on condition that Charles would give up all connection with\r\nthe dukes of Guienne and Brittany. At last, in the spring of 1472,\r\nCharles announced that he would accept the proffered terms. At the same\r\ntime he privately assured the dukes that he only agreed to the treaty in\r\norder to recover his own possessions, and that he had no intention of\r\ndeserting them. But Louis was not so easily duped. He had received\r\nintelligence that his brother was hopelessly unwell, and he adroitly\r\npostponed any final agreement until the news came that the duke of\r\nGuienne had died on May 24. Of [Sidenote: Death of Charles of Guienne.]\r\ncourse it was rumoured that so opportune an event must be due to\r\ncontrivance rather than to chance, but Louis’s gains were so substantial\r\nthat he could afford to disregard a suspicion which had no real\r\nfoundation. Guienne reverted to the crown, troops were despatched to\r\ninvade Brittany, and the treaty on which so much time had been spent was\r\nrepudiated. Charles was carried away by rage and disappointment.\r\nAlthough the truce was not yet expired he crossed the Somme to harry the\r\nterritories of the French king. Nesle was taken and sacked with a\r\nbrutality unusual even in fifteenth century France, and Charles advanced\r\nto the siege of Beauvais. But his military skill was not equal to his\r\nindignation, and after a prolonged attack he was compelled to retreat\r\nand to close the campaign by a truce in November, 1472. Curiously enough\r\nthis proved more durable than many formal treaties of peace. The truce\r\nwas renewed from time to time, and Charles and Louis never again met in\r\nopen hostility.\r\n\r\nThe death of the duke of Guienne proved far more important than his life\r\nhad been. A coalition of the princes of the lilies had nearly ruined the\r\nmonarchy in 1465, [Sidenote: Altered policy of Charles the Bold, 1472.]\r\nand the energies of Louis had been taxed ever since to prevent its\r\nrevived activity. That coalition was now wholly broken up. Charles the\r\nBold was as hostile as ever to the French king, but he was compelled to\r\nadopt different means to overthrow his rival. Hitherto his primary\r\nconcern had been with the affairs of France. He had appeared to the\r\nworld as the powerful vassal who headed the forces of feudalism to\r\ndepress the authority of his suzerain. Henceforth he turned his chief\r\nattention from his French to his German provinces, and sought to build\r\nup a rival kingdom along the valley of the Rhine, which might surpass\r\nFrance in wealth and power, and might even bring to its ruler the\r\nimperial crown. The danger to Louis was perhaps as great, but it was\r\nwholly different in character, and it required wholly different\r\nexpedients to cope with it. That within France the monarchy had gained a\r\ndecisive victory over the forces arrayed against it was recognised by\r\ntwo of the most subtle intellects of the time. Philippe de Commines, the\r\nborn vassal and the intimate adviser of Charles the Bold, had already\r\nmade the acquaintance of Louis XI. during the troubled days at Péronne.\r\nIn the autumn of 1472 he deserted his suzerain to enter the service of\r\nthe king, whose character and career he has described in the most\r\nimportant historical work of the century. His example was followed by\r\nOdet d’Aydie, lord of Lescun, who had hitherto been the trusted guide of\r\nCharles of Guienne and Francis of Brittany. The shrewd Gascon found no\r\ndifficulty in gaining the favour of his new employer, and he was\r\nrewarded with the title of count of Comminges.\r\n\r\nAlready, before 1472, Charles the Bold had taken an important step in\r\nthe direction of territorial aggrandisement in Germany. Alsace and the\r\nBreisgau, representing the original Swabian possessions of the house\r\n[Sidenote: Acquisitions of Charles the Bold in Germany.] of Hapsburg,\r\nhad been ruled since 1439 by Sigismund, son of that Frederick of Tyrol\r\nwho had played a prominent part in the early stages of the Council of\r\nConstance (see p. 213). Like his ancestors, Sigismund had become\r\ninvolved in a quarrel with the members of the Swiss confederation, and\r\nby a treaty in 1468 he had pledged himself to pay to the League a\r\nconsiderable sum of money. Unable to raise the sum from his own\r\nresources, he had applied to Charles the Bold, who agreed to furnish the\r\nmoney if Alsace and the Breisgau were handed over to him as security. It\r\nwas more than improbable that the penniless count of Tyrol would ever\r\nredeem the pledge, and Charles, treating the provinces as his own\r\npossession, intrusted the administration to Peter of Hagenbach. When, in\r\n1472, the direct opposition to Louis XI. came to an end, Charles turned\r\nwith avidity to that acquisition of lands in Germany which was to prove\r\nthe cause of his ruin. Interfering as arbiter in a dispute between\r\nfather and son in Gelderland, he seized the disputed duchy for himself\r\n(1473). In the same year occurred the death of Nicolas of Calabria, the\r\ngrandson and last male descendant of the old Réné le Bon. The duchy of\r\nLorraine now passed to another grandson, Réné of Vaudemont, who\r\ninherited both the Angevin and the Vaudemont claim. Lorraine was of\r\npeculiar importance to Charles the Bold, as it lay between his northern\r\nand his southern dominions. Although he had no legal claim to interfere,\r\nhe seized the young duke and only released him on condition that he\r\nshould cede four fortresses as a guarantee for the free passage of\r\nBurgundian forces through Lorraine. Meanwhile Charles was negotiating\r\nwith the emperor Frederick III. to have his duchy of Burgundy erected\r\ninto a kingdom, and he intended to claim all those territories which at\r\none time or another had borne the name of Burgundy. Such a claim would\r\nhave included Savoy, Provence, and several adjacent districts. The\r\nemperor was to be bribed by the proposal of a marriage between his son\r\nMaximilian and the heiress of these vast dominions present and\r\nprospective. An interview was arranged at Trier, and Charles brought\r\nwith him the crown that was to be placed on his head. But Frederick\r\nIII., always cautious and rather timid, was alarmed by the extravagant\r\npretensions of the aspirant to royalty, and he was cognisant of a scheme\r\nto recover Alsace for his cousin Sigismund. So one night the emperor\r\nslipped away in a boat down the Moselle, leaving the duke the\r\nlaughing-stock of Europe. But this humiliation failed to check Charles’s\r\nambition, and in 1474 he embarked on a new enterprise. The archbishop of\r\nCologne, Robert of Bavaria, deposed by his chapter and his subjects,\r\nappealed for assistance to the duke of Burgundy, who seized the\r\nopportunity to gain on the middle Rhine a preponderance similar to that\r\nwhich he had acquired in the bishopric of Liége. With a large army\r\nCharles entered the territories of Cologne, as the champion of the\r\narchbishop against his rebellious subjects, and laid siege to Neuss, a\r\nfortress on the Rhine held by the Landgrave of Hesse, whose brother had\r\nbeen appointed administrator of the diocese.\r\n\r\nThe siege of Neuss was one of the great blunders of Charles the Bold. He\r\nhad never shown any skill in siege operations, and for a whole year his\r\nobstinacy [Sidenote: Louis XI. stirs up enemies against Charles the\r\nBold.] kept him before a town which he was ultimately unable to reduce.\r\nDuring these months his enemies were able to attack with impunity the\r\nextremities of his dominions, and he lost a favourable opportunity of\r\nweakening his chief opponent Louis XI. Louis was frequently urged by his\r\nadvisers to check the aggrandisement of the Burgundian duke by a renewal\r\nof direct hostilities. But he preferred the more subtle policy of\r\nallowing his rival to exhaust his strength in distant enterprises, while\r\nhe secretly encouraged the resistance of the German princes and people\r\nwhose interests were threatened by Charles’s progress. Among the latter\r\nwere the leading members of the Swiss Confederation. They had always\r\nquarrelled with the Hapsburgs in Alsace, and they were not likely to\r\nfind a less formidable neighbour in the duke of Burgundy, whose\r\nexpansion southwards could hardly be effected without destroying their\r\nindependence. The oppressive rule of Peter of Hagenbach, Charles’s\r\nbailiff in Alsace, was bitterly resented by all the cities and towns of\r\nSwabia, and Bern, now the leading canton of the Confederation, was\r\nprominent in demanding redress. Louis seized the opportunity to score a\r\nnotable diplomatic victory. He induced Sigismund to demand the\r\nrestoration of Alsace, and he set himself to reconcile the Swiss with\r\ntheir old opponent. On March 30, 1474, it was agreed by the Everlasting\r\nCompact that Sigismund should renounce all Hapsburg claims within the\r\nterritory of the League, and that the confederates should support him in\r\nrecovering the provinces which had been pledged to Charles. The chief\r\nSwabian towns furnished the necessary money to redeem the pledge, and\r\nwhen Charles took no notice of the demand for restitution, Alsace was\r\ninvaded and Hagenbach was put to death (May 9, 1474). After this there\r\nwas good reason to dread the duke’s enmity, and a strong party was\r\nformed within the League which contended that the safest method of\r\ndefence was to anticipate attack. French gold was employed to aid and\r\nextend this party, which was headed by Nicolas von Diesbach of Bern, and\r\nthe emperor Frederick III. was induced to use his authority to urge on a\r\nwar with Burgundy. In October a treaty was concluded with France, and\r\nthis was followed by a formal defiance of Charles and an invasion of\r\nFranche-Comté. Charles received the news of these events before Neuss,\r\nbut he refused to abandon the siege, and the only step which he took to\r\nprotect his interests in the south was to conclude a close alliance with\r\nYolande of France, the dowager-duchess and regent of Savoy. Yolande was\r\nthe sister of Louis XI., but her policy was as independent and\r\nself-seeking as that of her brother, and she did not scruple to break\r\noff the intimate alliance between Savoy and France which had resulted in\r\nher own marriage and that of Louis. She even used her influence to\r\ndetach her brother-in-law, Galeazzo Maria Sforza, from France, and to\r\narrange an alliance between Milan and Burgundy. But the first result of\r\nher action was to extend the area of Swiss aggression, and in the spring\r\nof 1475 Granson, Morat, and other Savoyard territories fell into the\r\nhands of the confederates. About the same time Réné of Lorraine was\r\ninduced by the French king to repudiate his recent treaty with Charles\r\nthe Bold and to invade the duchy of Luxemburg. So formidable was the\r\ncoalition now formed that Louis sent to Frederick III. to propose a\r\npartition of the Burgundian territories, the French provinces to be\r\nescheated to the crown, and the German fiefs to be claimed by the\r\nemperor. But the cautious Hapsburg would not commit himself to so\r\nfar-reaching a scheme, and replied that he preferred not to bargain\r\nabout the bear’s skin until the beast was dead.\r\n\r\nThe position of Charles was one of great danger. He was practically at\r\nwar with the Swiss, with Sigismund of Tyrol, with the duke of Lorraine,\r\nand with the forces of the empire, which he had alienated by his\r\nunjustifiable intervention in the affairs of Cologne. But Charles knew\r\nthat these enemies were all set in motion by Louis _XI._, and that if he\r\ncould ruin his arch-opponent the hostile coalition would almost\r\ncertainly fall to pieces. And in 1475 he had an unequalled chance of\r\ndealing a fatal blow to the power of France. For years the duke\r\n[Sidenote: Edward IV. invades France, 1475.] of Brittany and other\r\nopponents of the French monarchy had been striving to bring about a\r\nrenewal of the English invasion, and at last their efforts were rewarded\r\nwith success. Edward IV., securely established on the English throne by\r\nthe double defeat of the Nevilles and the Lancastrian nobles, determined\r\nto resume the ambitious schemes of Henry V. and to make himself king of\r\nFrance with the aid of Burgundy. In 1474 the terms of the treaty had\r\nbeen arranged with Charles, who was to receive as his reward Champagne\r\nand some smaller districts, together with complete emancipation from the\r\nsuzerainty of France. In the summer of 1475 a considerable English army\r\nwas transported to Calais, and Charles at last set himself free to aid\r\nhis ally by retiring from Neuss, and concluding an agreement with the\r\nemperor by which the Pope was to arbitrate in the dispute about Cologne.\r\nThe truce between Burgundy and France had expired on May 1, and Charles\r\nhad refused all the entreaties of Louis for its prolongation. But all\r\nthe hopes which Charles had based upon the intervention of England were\r\ndoomed to disappointment. Edward IV. was immensely chagrined when\r\nCharles arrived alone at Calais, having sent his army from Neuss to\r\nchastise the duke of Lorraine. St. Pol, who had offered to admit the\r\nEnglish into St. Quentin, fired upon the approaching forces from behind\r\nthe closed gates. The French monarchy was infinitely stronger in 1475\r\nthan it had been in 1415, and Edward IV. was shrewd enough to see that\r\nwith such support as he received from professed allies the conquest of\r\nFrance was impossible. Louis on his side was not slow to profit by the\r\nobvious discouragement of the invaders, and promptly opened negotiations\r\nwhich resulted in a personal interview at Pecquigni on the Somme. In\r\nreturn for a large sum of money and a promise that the dauphin should\r\nmarry his daughter Elizabeth, Edward agreed to withdraw from France.\r\nCharles was furious at what he denounced as treacherous desertion, but\r\nhis own conduct had been so obviously selfish that his complaints were\r\ntreated as unreasonable, and he was compelled to renew his former truce\r\nwith Louis XI.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the English invasion and the renewal of peaceful\r\nrelations between France and Burgundy proved [Sidenote: Fate of St.\r\nPol.] fatal to St. Pol, who had succeeded for five years in maintaining\r\na practically independent position in Picardy. He had been profoundly\r\ndisappointed by the termination of active hostilities in 1472, but he\r\nstill trusted in his ability to play off one rival against the other,\r\nand he was confident that their mutual jealousy would never allow them\r\nto act together against him. For a time his forecast had been justified.\r\nIn 1472 it had been proposed that Louis and Charles should unite to\r\npunish the constable, but the scheme had broken down, because neither\r\nwould trust the other. In 1475 the proposal was renewed. St. Pol’s\r\nrecent conduct, and especially his relations with Edward IV. who handed\r\nover to Louis the constable’s correspondence, had created a strong\r\ndesire to punish the man who betrayed and deceived everybody in turn.\r\nCharles was to have St. Quentin, Ham, and Bohain, with all the fiefs\r\nwhich St. Pol held of him, on condition that he would undertake to\r\ncapture the constable and either punish him within eight days or hand\r\nhim over to the king. On the news of this treaty St. Pol determined to\r\ntrust Charles rather than Louis, partly because he believed him to be\r\nless vindictive, and partly because after his territories were in\r\nCharles’s hands the latter had little to gain by inflicting any further\r\npenalty. Charles was besieging Nanci when his ministers sent word that\r\nthe constable was in their hands. Charles was anxious to avoid any\r\nFrench opposition in Lorraine and he sent instructions that if Nanci\r\nheld out beyond November 24, St. Pol was to be handed over to the\r\nFrench, but if it were taken before that date they were to keep him in\r\ntheir hands. Nanci did not surrender till after the time had elapsed,\r\nbut Charles began to think that his order had been hasty and that St.\r\nPol might still be useful to him in his quarrel with France. His\r\ninstructions to delay the transfer, however, came too late, as the\r\nBurgundian ministers, many of whom had a personal grudge against St.\r\nPol, had punctually obeyed the original order. Louis was not unwilling\r\nto show that neither rank, nor royal relationship, nor eminent office\r\ncould save a rebel against the crown, and St. Pol, of whose treason\r\nthere was ample proof, was executed in Paris on December 19, 1475.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1475 Charles the Bold seemed to be at the height of his\r\npower. He was at peace both with the emperor and the king of France.\r\nSince the submission of Ghent he had met with no opposition from his\r\nsubjects in the Netherlands. The fall of St. Pol had restored his\r\ncomplete ascendency in Picardy. Savoy and Milan were apparently loyal\r\nand almost submissive allies. The aged Réné of Provence, who had never\r\nloved the house of Vaudemont, expressed his willingness to disinherit\r\nhis only surviving grandson in favour of the duke of Burgundy. Above\r\nall, Charles had at last succeeded in uniting the two main divisions of\r\nhis realm by the conquest of Lorraine, and he determined to make Nanci\r\nthe capital of the Burgundian kingdom that seemed now to be within his\r\ngrasp. His one immediate task was to recover the province of Alsace, and\r\nto punish the Swiss, not only for aiding to restore Sigismund, but also\r\nfor their raids upon his own territories and those of his allies. His\r\ntroops were exhausted [Sidenote: Charles’s war with the Swiss, 1476.] by\r\ntheir exertions in the long siege of Neuss and the subsequent conquest\r\nof Lorraine; but his resources, both in men and money, were so\r\ninfinitely superior to those of his opponents that it was hardly\r\npossible to doubt his ultimate victory. The Swiss had begun the war as\r\nthe allies of the emperor and the French king, but they were now\r\ndeserted by both. In February 1476 Charles crossed the Jura to drive the\r\nSwiss from the districts they had seized in Savoy. Granson, a town near\r\nthe lake of Neuchâtel, which was held by the house of Orange as a fief\r\nof Savoy, was taken by the Burgundians, and the garrison was put to\r\ndeath. Two days later the confederates arrived, and at once began the\r\nattack. Charles ordered a portion of his army to retire to the plain\r\nwhere he could use his superior cavalry. But the retirement became a\r\npanic-stricken retreat, and the Swiss, pressing their advance, gained a\r\ncomplete and easy victory (March 2, 1476). Granson was recovered, and\r\nthe Burgundian camp and artillery were the prize of the conquerors. So\r\nhumiliating a disaster was the more galling to Charles that it shook the\r\nfidelity of his allies. The succession in Provence upon which he had\r\nconfidently reckoned, was now transferred by Réné to the French king.\r\nGaleazzo Maria Sforza opened negotiations with Louis, and even Yolande\r\nof Savoy began to contemplate the possibility of a reconciliation with\r\nher brother. But Savoy could hardly desert Charles as long as there was\r\na prospect of recovering the lost lands with his help; and the\r\nBurgundian power was not destroyed by a single disaster. Within a few\r\nweeks a new army had been collected at Lausanne, and Charles advanced to\r\nthe siege of Morat, which the Bernese had taken from the Count of\r\nRomont, a brother of the late duke of Savoy. The Swiss hastily\r\nreassembled the troops, which had been disbanded after their recent\r\nsuccess in spite of the warnings of Bern. On June 22, an obstinate, and\r\nfor a long time, a very equal contest was fought out under the walls of\r\nMorat. At last the Swiss gained a decisive advantage by turning the\r\nflank of the Burgundian army; and the very obstinacy with which the\r\nlatter fought only served to make their losses heavier. Nearly\r\ntwo-thirds of Charles’s forces were practically annihilated, and the\r\nfinal desertion of his allies, combined with the disaffection of his own\r\nsubjects, rendered it hopeless to renew the struggle. Savoy made peace\r\nwith the Swiss, through the mediation of France; and Granson, Morat, and\r\nother towns of Vaud became subject to the Confederation. Charles retired\r\ninto gloomy solitude near Pontarlier, and it was feared that his reason\r\nwould give way as he cursed the ill-fortune which had humbled so\r\npowerful a prince before a despicable foe. He was roused from his\r\nretreat by the news that Lorraine was lost to him. The young Réné had\r\njoined the Swiss in the battle of Morat, and had proceeded after the\r\nvictory to raise a force with which he had recovered Nanci. Charles\r\nhurriedly collected a third army, and, in spite of the winter cold,\r\ncommenced a second siege of the town which he had destined to be his\r\ncapital. The scanty garrison could not long have resisted the attack,\r\nbut Réné appealed for the assistance of the Swiss, and they [Sidenote:\r\nDeath of Charles the Bold.] sent 20,000 men to raise the siege. The\r\nItalian mercenaries, in whom Charles placed great confidence, were\r\nheaded by the count of Campobasso, a Neapolitan who had been driven into\r\nexile for his adhesion to the house of Anjou. Of that house Réné of\r\nLorraine might now claim to be the lawful heir; and Campobasso was\r\ninduced to desert his master in favour of the family to which his first\r\nallegiance was due. This treachery placed Charles at a fatal\r\ndisadvantage, and he had to fight between the besieged and the relieving\r\nforces. But his dogged character would not allow him to retreat, and in\r\na third contest with the despised German Confederation the great Valois\r\nduke of Burgundy found an obscure and unhonoured death (January 5,\r\n1477).\r\n\r\nLouis XI. had watched the events of the last twelve months, at first\r\nwith anxiety, and later with feverish attention. Ever since his\r\naccession he had been haunted by the [Sidenote: Louis seizes Burgundian\r\nterritories.] sense of Charles’s hostility, and the dangers which it\r\ninvolved; and now his great rival had been slain by the agency of an\r\nunforeseen and apparently unequal opponent. The only claimant of the\r\nvast inheritance left vacant by the death of Charles the Bold was an\r\nunmarried girl of twenty-one years. Various schemes were debated in the\r\nroyal council as to the best way of profiting by so favourable a\r\ncontingency. One very obvious plan was to effect a marriage between Mary\r\nof Burgundy and the dauphin. But there were several objections to this.\r\nThe dauphin was only in his eighth year; he was already betrothed to an\r\nEnglish princess, and Edward IV. was not likely either to pardon an\r\ninsult to his daughter, or to acquiesce in the absorption of the\r\nBurgundian inheritance by the French monarchy. To the alternative scheme\r\nof marrying Mary to a French noble of royal blood, such as Charles of\r\nAngoulême, it could be objected that the new dynasty thus created might\r\nbe as dangerous and disloyal as that to which it would succeed. Louis\r\ndetermined to keep the possibility of either marriage as a card to be\r\nplayed, if necessary or expedient, but in the meantime to take measures\r\nfor the occupation of those Burgundian territories which France could\r\nacquire without serious opposition. The revival of such a power as that\r\nof Charles might be prevented, and the adhesion of German princes might\r\nbe purchased, by a partition of the fiefs which the late duke had held\r\nof the empire. No preparations had been made to resist Louis, and his\r\npromptness ensured a considerable measure of success. He had an\r\nunquestionable claim to the Somme towns, whose transfer had been limited\r\nto male heirs; and the duchy of Burgundy could be reasonably claimed as\r\nan escheated fief. But Flanders, Artois, and Franche-Comté had come to\r\nthe Burgundian house through an heiress, so that Mary’s right of\r\nsuccession could hardly be disputed. Regardless of this consideration,\r\nand of the fact that Franche-Comté was an imperial fief, Louis proceeded\r\nwith the work of annexation. Both the duchy and the county of Burgundy\r\nsubmitted to French rule. From Picardy, which returned willingly to its\r\nformer allegiance, the forces of Louis entered Artois and succeeded in\r\nreducing its capital, Arras.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of Artois brought the French to the frontier of Flanders,\r\nthe most wealthy and important of the Burgundian possessions. The\r\nFlemish citizens, and especially [Sidenote: Conduct of the Flemings.]\r\nthose of Ghent, where Mary of Burgundy was residing, were not likely to\r\nallow the choice of their future ruler to be settled without their\r\nparticipation. Their policy in the matter was quite distinct. They had\r\nhated Burgundian rule and the Burgundian ministers whom Charles and his\r\npredecessors had appointed to govern them. As long as their sovereign\r\nhad been a mere count of Flanders, they had enjoyed a large measure of\r\nindependence and self-government, but they had lost this under the too\r\npowerful Valois dynasty. They therefore welcomed the occupation of the\r\nBurgundies, and had no objection to a further weakening of Mary’s\r\ninheritance. But they would not be annexed to France, and the aggressive\r\nmeasures of Louis XI. drove them into opposition to him. The Burgundian\r\nministers, whom Charles had left in authority, were seized by the mob on\r\nthe discovery that they were conducting separate negotiations with\r\nFrance, and in spite of the passionate entreaties of Mary, were put to\r\ndeath. The plan that commended itself to the people of Ghent was to\r\nmarry Mary to Adolf of Gelderland, the youthful monster who had been\r\nimprisoned and disinherited for brutal ill-treatment of his father.\r\nAdolf was released and sent to oppose the French before Tournay; where,\r\nto Mary’s great relief, he was killed in an unsuccessful attempt to\r\nrelieve the town. This event, and the necessity of gaining support\r\nagainst the encroachments of France, forced the Gantois to revive the\r\nscheme of marrying Mary to [Sidenote: Maximilian marries Mary of\r\nBurgundy.] Maximilian of Hapsburg, the son of the emperor Frederick III.\r\nMary herself, naturally frightened and aggrieved by the conduct of Louis\r\nsince her father’s death, was not averse to the proposal, and the\r\nmarriage was solemnised in August 1477. Louis was extremely chagrined by\r\nthe news of an event, which not only frustrated his plans for a further\r\npartition of the Burgundian inheritance, but also compelled him to fight\r\nfor the provinces he had already seized. Maximilian undertook the\r\nchampionship of his wife’s claims with his usual impetuosity. But he was\r\nhampered by his want of money—Commines calls his father ‘the most\r\nperfectly niggardly man of his time’—and by the obstruction of the\r\nFlemish citizens, who had taken advantage of the weak government since\r\nCharles the Bold’s death to recover much of their old independence. In\r\n1482 Mary died, leaving two infant children, Philip and Margaret. This\r\nwas a great blow to Maximilian, who had no longer any formal authority\r\nin the Netherlands, except so far as the estates of the various\r\nprovinces recognised him as his son’s guardian. In these circumstances\r\nhe was not unwilling to come to terms with Louis, and the treaty of\r\nArras [Sidenote: Treaty of Arras, 1482.] gave to the king most of the\r\nterritories he had contended for. The dauphin, Charles, was to be\r\nbetrothed to Margaret, the daughter of Maximilian and Mary, and she was\r\nto be brought up in France as its future queen. Artois and Franche Comté\r\nwere to be regarded as her dowry. The treaty made no mention of the\r\nSomme towns or of the duchy of Burgundy, and thus tacitly conceded\r\nLouis’s contention that his legal rights to these provinces were\r\nindisputable. It was fortunate for Louis that Edward IV., who had good\r\nreason to regard this treaty as both injurious and insulting, was not\r\nable to give practical expression to his displeasure. He died in 1483,\r\nand the disturbances which followed kept England from any idea of\r\nintervention on the Continent. But though the treaty of Arras appears,\r\nat first sight, to be a considerable triumph for the policy of Louis,\r\nthe permanent gain to the French monarchy was not very great. Artois and\r\nFranche-Comté were lost again before very long; and the annexation of\r\nthe Netherlands to the Hapsburg possessions, together with the\r\nsubsequent further aggrandisement of that house, involved France in even\r\ngreater dangers than those which had been threatened by the Valois dukes\r\nof Burgundy. But the subsequent struggle which thus arose differed from\r\nits predecessor in one very important respect. The Hapsburgs of Spain\r\nand Austria were more powerful sovereigns than Philip the Good or\r\nCharles the Bold, but they were complete foreigners to France, and had\r\nnone of that traditional and family alliance with French nobles and\r\nFrench parties which gave to the Valois-Burgundian dynasty such a unique\r\nposition. The contest with the Hapsburgs served to strengthen, not to\r\ndestroy, the national unity of France.\r\n\r\nThe relations with Burgundy constitute by far the most important episode\r\nof the reign of Louis XI.; and he could [Sidenote: Successes of Louis\r\nXI.] boast of no more conspicuous achievement than the defeat of Charles\r\nthe Bold, and the annexation of a considerable share of his dominions.\r\nBut he gained other successes and acquired other lands. By intervening\r\nto support John II. of Aragon against the rebellious Catalans (1462), he\r\nobtained the cession of Roussillon and Cerdagne, and for a time extended\r\nthe French frontier to the Pyrenees. And the Angevin inheritance was\r\nalmost as great a windfall to the monarchy as the duchy of Burgundy.\r\nRéné le Bon had hastily abandoned the cause of Charles the Bold, after\r\nthe latter’s defeats in 1476; and Louis XI. succeeded in extorting from\r\nhis uncle an arrangement by which the latter’s territories were to pass,\r\nin the first place, to his nephew, Charles of Maine, and on the\r\nextinction of his line to the crown. The successive deaths of Réné in\r\n1480 and of Charles of Maine in 1481, gave to Louis the possession of\r\nAnjou and Maine, with the duchy of Bar and the imperial fief of\r\nProvence. Equally important, from the point of view of the French\r\nmonarchy, were the signal humiliations inflicted by Louis upon the great\r\nfeudatories who had ventured, in the early years of his reign, to\r\nidentify themselves with the cause of opposition to the monarchy. The\r\nduke of Alençon was kept a prisoner till his death in 1476. The count of\r\nArmagnac, the restless leader of the southern nobles, was attacked in\r\nhis chief town of Lectoure and perished in the sack which followed its\r\ncapture. His cousin, the duke of Nemours, who had been a favourite\r\ncompanion of Louis in his youth and had since been twice pardoned for\r\nungrateful treachery, was executed in 1477 after having suffered the\r\nmost horrible tortures. The fate of St. Pol has been already related.\r\nWith regard to the nobles who were more closely related to the royal\r\nfamily, Louis took precautions to ensure their loyalty or to disarm\r\ntheir opposition. The duke of Bourbon abstained from further rebellion\r\nafter the War of the Public Weal. His brother and heir, Pierre de\r\nBeaujeu, was married to the king’s eldest daughter, Anne, with the\r\nproviso that if they left no male heirs the succession should pass to\r\nthe crown. For Louis of Orleans, the heir-presumptive to the throne\r\nafter the dauphin, a bride was found in another daughter, Jeanne, who\r\nwas deformed in person and was regarded as unlikely to have issue.\r\n\r\nThe government of Louis XI., though in many ways advantageous to France,\r\nwas too obviously selfish to be popular. His death in August, 1483,\r\ntransferred the crown to his only son, Charles VIII., but as [Sidenote:\r\nRegency of Anne of Beaujeu.] he was too young to rule, the actual\r\ngovernment was assumed by Anne of Beaujeu. She had much of her father’s\r\nability and all his love of power, but her position was insecure and she\r\nwas obliged to conciliate support by measures which Louis XI. would\r\nnever have adopted. The States-General were convoked at Tours in January\r\n1484, and for the first time the rural districts were represented in the\r\nthird estate, which had hitherto included only delegates from the towns.\r\nAlthough the estates recognised the regent, their _cahier_ of grievances\r\nshowed an obvious hostility to the despotic rule of the late king. Among\r\nother things they demanded that they should meet regularly every second\r\nyear. But the States-General, having lost all efficient control over\r\ntaxation, had no power to extort concessions, and the crown reserved\r\nabsolute discretion as to the redress of grievances. A more serious\r\ndanger to Anne was a coalition of nobles, including the duke of Brittany\r\nand headed by Louis of Orleans, who deemed it a wrong that he was\r\nexcluded from the regency. There was some risk that the confederates\r\nmight receive support from Richard III. of England, who had good reason\r\nto divert the attention of his subjects to a foreign war, and from Réné\r\nof Lorraine, who advanced a well-founded claim to his grandfather’s\r\ndominions of Bar and Provence. Anne of Beaujeu showed notable ability in\r\nmeeting her opponents. To prevent English intervention, Henry of\r\nRichmond, whose mother was the last of the Beauforts, was encouraged to\r\nprosecute the enterprise which placed the house of Tudor on the throne\r\n(1485). The duke of Lorraine was partially satisfied by the cession of\r\nBar, and the prospect of gaining Provence was dangled before his eyes in\r\nan artfully prolonged law-suit, which was not decided against him until\r\nall danger was over. Meanwhile, the princes, deprived of external aid,\r\nproved powerless to resist the forces of the crown. The Bretons were\r\ndefeated, and Louis of Orleans, carried a prisoner to Bourges, found it\r\nto his interest to reconcile himself with his cousin.\r\n\r\nA few days after the defeat of the Bretons the death of duke Francis II.\r\nextinguished the male line of the Montforts, and left the one great\r\nprovince which had retained [Sidenote: Succession in Brittany.] its old\r\nindependence in the hands of his daughter Anne (September 9, 1488). The\r\ndisposal of the hand of so important an heiress was naturally a matter\r\nof great political interest, and Anne of Beaujeu, who wished to use the\r\nopportunity for the gain of the monarchy, was chagrined to learn in 1490\r\nthat the young duchess had been married by proxy to Maximilian of\r\nAustria, who had been a widower since the death of Mary of Burgundy.\r\nDeclaring the marriage to be null without royal consent, she despatched\r\nan army into Brittany, and Anne of Brittany was compelled to give her\r\nhand to Charles VIII. A double injury was thus inflicted upon\r\nMaximilian. Not only was he deprived of a wife, but his daughter, who\r\nhad been educated in France since 1482 as the future queen, was sent\r\nback to him. The archduke, however, was too distant and too busy\r\nelsewhere to be immediately formidable, and it was worth while to risk\r\nhis displeasure in order to secure possession of Brittany. But the\r\nchildren of Charles VIII. and Anne did not survive their parents, and\r\ntwo subsequent marriages were necessary before the union of Brittany\r\nwith France was complete.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of the king was the last achievement of Anne of Beaujeu,\r\nwhose regency came to an end when her brother assumed the reins of\r\ngovernment, while she herself [Sidenote: The question of Naples.] became\r\nduchess of Bourbon by the death of her brother-in-law. In 1493 a wholly\r\nnew problem was presented to the French government by the arrival of\r\nNeapolitan exiles with an invitation to Charles VIII. to claim the crown\r\nof Naples on the same grounds as he already held Provence. The late\r\nregent and the more experienced councillors were resolute in opposing\r\nthe scheme. But Charles himself and his younger associates were dazzled\r\nby the prospect of an Italian kingdom, and the proffered support of\r\nLudovico Sforza seemed to give a reasonable prospect of success. Before\r\nCharles could venture to quit his kingdom it was necessary to secure it\r\nagainst the hostility of jealous neighbours. Henry VII. of England, who\r\nhad come forward as the champion of Anne of Brittany, was bought off by\r\nthe peace of Etaples which offered him a large money bribe (1492). The\r\ntreaty of Barcelona restored Roussillon and Cerdagne to Ferdinand of\r\nAragon (January 1493); while the enmity of Maximilian was appeased by\r\nthe treaty of Senlis and the cession of Artois and Franche-Comté, which\r\nhad been the stipulated dowry of Margaret (May 23, 1493). In September\r\n1494, Charles set out on his journey towards the Alps. The resources of\r\nthe revived French monarchy were to be employed in an enterprise of\r\nwhich no one could foresee the end, but which was destined to usher in a\r\nnew epoch in the history of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n              GERMANY AND THE HAPSBURG EMPERORS, 1437-1493\r\n\r\n\r\n    German disunion in the fifteenth century—The House of Hapsburg—The\r\n    succession in Hungary and Bohemia—The Imperial election in\r\n    1438—Death of Albert II.—Election of Frederick III.—Death of\r\n    Frederick I. of Brandenburg—Futile opposition in Germany to the\r\n    Emperor and the Papacy—Frederick III. at war with the\r\n    Swiss—Sigismund of Tyrol—Succession to Albert II. in Austria,\r\n    Hungary, and Bohemia—Ladislas Postumus—Relief of Belgrade and death\r\n    of John Hunyadi—Death of Ladislas Postumus—Austria falls to the\r\n    Styrian Hapsburgs—Election of Mathias Corvinus in Hungary and of\r\n    George Podiebrad in Bohemia—War between Hungary and\r\n    Bohemia—Relations of Frederick III. with Burgundy—Hungarian\r\n    conquests in Austria—Last years and death of Frederick III.\r\n\r\nIn the history of three of the great countries of Europe, France,\r\nEngland, and Spain, the fifteenth century marks a [Sidenote: Disunion\r\nand weakness of Germany.] decisive epoch in the growth both of national\r\nunity and of monarchical government. In France the civil strife of\r\nArmagnacs and Burgundians and the long struggle against the English\r\nprepared the way for the rule of Charles VII. and Louis XI. In England\r\nthe Wars of the Roses ended with the accession of a powerful Tudor\r\ndynasty. In Spain national sentiment was kindled by the anti-Moorish\r\ncrusades, and the union of the chief kingdoms by the marriage of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella led to the great expansion of Spain under the\r\ndespotic rule of Charles I. and Philip II. The history of Germany\r\nresembles that of its neighbours up to a certain point. Anarchy and\r\ndisorder were as conspicuous there as they were in France under Charles\r\nVI., or under Henry VI. in England. The schism which filled the first\r\ndecade of the century both illustrated and increased the weakness and\r\nthe degradation of the once powerful German monarchy. But in Germany no\r\nremedy was found for political and social disunion. No ruler arose with\r\nthe strength and the resolution that were needed to transform a vague\r\nsuzerainty into a territorial monarchy, as Charles IV. had schemed to\r\ndo. On the contrary, there was a marked decline of imperial authority,\r\nwhich reached its nadir in the reign of Frederick III. The impulsive\r\nSigismund had striven for a moment to revive the Ghibelline tradition,\r\nand he seemed to have made a considerable stride when, in 1415, he\r\nhumbled the pride of Frederick of Tyrol, and rewarded the loyalty of\r\nFrederick of Hohenzollern with the electoral Mark of Brandenburg. But\r\nSigismund’s imperial ambitions were bound up with the cause of the\r\nreforming party at Constance, and he was discouraged and disconcerted by\r\nits failure. From that time he abandoned the interests of Germany to\r\ndevote himself to the affairs of Bohemia and Hungary. The party which\r\nhad rallied round him at Constance, deserted by their natural leader,\r\nendeavoured to give to Germany a new central government which should\r\ntake the place of the decadent monarchy. A series of ignominious defeats\r\nby the Hussites enabled them to carry through the diet some tentative\r\nreforms in 1427. There was to be a system of imperial taxation, an\r\nimperial army, and a standing representative council to wield the\r\nexecutive power which the emperors had allowed to fall from their hands.\r\nBut the projected reforms ended in failure. The sense of nationality was\r\nnot strong enough to overcome the selfish independence of states and\r\nclasses. The two last crusades against the Bohemians were even more\r\nhumiliating to Germany than their predecessors.\r\n\r\nThat the disunion of Germany was a source of many evils and of serious\r\ndangers was apparent even to the proverbial blindness of contemporaries.\r\nThe dependence of Italy had become the merest name. Even Milan, which\r\nunder the Visconti was most closely connected with Germany, was about to\r\npass to the Sforzas, who did not think it worth while even to apply for\r\nimperial investiture. North of the Alps, Lyons and Dauphiné had long\r\nbeen absorbed by France. Provence and Lorraine were in the hands of a\r\nFrench dynasty, and before the end of the century the former had been\r\nacquired by the French crown. Savoy was more independent of France, but\r\nhardly more closely tied to Germany. The Old League of High Germany, as\r\nthe Swiss confederation was then called, had paraded devotion to the\r\nempire as a means of resisting the claims of the Hapsburgs, but the\r\ncantons really desired freedom from all external control, and by the end\r\nof the century they had practically acquired it. Franche-Comté was ruled\r\nby a Valois duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good, who was absorbing one\r\nafter the other a number of imperial fiefs in the Low Countries. The\r\nScandinavian kingdoms, strengthened for a time by the union of Kalmar,\r\nwere beginning to recover their previous losses, and the Hanseatic\r\nLeague, the champion of German interests in the Baltic and the North\r\nSea, was no longer at the height of its power. In the north-east, the\r\nTeutonic knights had been fatally weakened by the union of Poland and\r\nLithuania, and since the battle of Tannenberg in 1410 were waging what\r\nseemed to be a hopeless struggle against the powerful Jagellon kings.\r\nThe danger of a general Slav revolt against German encroachments had\r\nbeen brought even more nearly home to the princes of Germany by the long\r\nBohemian war. It is true that the extreme Hussites had been defeated in\r\n1434, but it was by their own countrymen; and the sentiment of national\r\nindependence, which was necessarily anti-German, was almost as strong as\r\never. And in the south-east a new and far more terrible danger was\r\napproaching. The Turks had already established themselves in the Balkan\r\npeninsula, and threatened to sweep up the Danube valley. Hungary was the\r\nonly substantial guard to the German frontier; and if Hungarian\r\nresistance failed, it was hardly likely that the German troops, impotent\r\nto crush the ill-armed followers of Ziska, would be able to resist the\r\nall-conquering Janissaries.\r\n\r\nLosses on the extremities were the inevitable result of weakness at the\r\ncentre. But although this weakness continued, Germany escaped from some\r\nof the extreme disasters which seemed almost inevitable. It is possible\r\nthat a too vigorous attempt to bring about a compulsory union might have\r\nbroken the state up into its component parts, and Germany, like Italy,\r\nmight have become a mere geographical expression. That this complete\r\ndisruption was avoided, and that Germany retained at any rate some\r\nsymbols of unity, may be attributed, partly to the very looseness of the\r\nfederal tie, which was so little felt that it was hardly worth while to\r\nmake an effort for its rupture, and partly to the extraordinary series\r\nof events which enabled a single family, the House of Hapsburg, to\r\nobtain a sort of hereditary primacy within Germany. In view of the\r\ndanger threatened by Slavs and Turks, it was of supreme importance that\r\nGermany should retain its hold upon the border states of Bohemia and\r\nHungary, which had been gained by Sigismund. But with Sigismund’s death\r\nin 1437 the male line of the House of Luxemburg became extinct, and the\r\nfamily was only represented by two women—Sigismund’s own daughter,\r\nElizabeth, who was married to Albert V. of Austria, and his niece,\r\nanother Elizabeth, the widow of Antony of Brabant.\r\n\r\nAlthough Albert of Austria might claim through his wife the succession\r\nto the Luxemburg inheritance, the most [Sidenote: The House of\r\nHapsburg.] sanguine of contemporary observers could hardly have foretold\r\nthat the Hapsburgs would bring even partial salvation to Germany. Since\r\nthe first great expansion of the family under Rudolf I. and his\r\nimmediate successors, its power and prestige had sensibly diminished.\r\nThis had been caused, partly by defeats at the hands of the Swiss, and\r\npartly by the subdivision of Hapsburg territories effected in 1370\r\nbetween the two brothers, Albert III. and Leopold III. (see p. 137).\r\nAlbert had taken the archduchy of Austria, and Leopold the other\r\nterritories of the House—the Swabian lands, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola,\r\nand Tyrol. The Albertine line in Austria had been continued by the\r\nsuccessive rulers Albert IV. (d. 1404) and Albert V. The history of the\r\nLeopoldine line had been less simple. Leopold himself had fallen in 1386\r\nin the famous battle of Sempach, and had left his dominions to the joint\r\nrule of four sons—William, Leopold, Ernest, and Frederick. But the first\r\nprecedent of subdivision was again followed, and in the end the two\r\nsurviving sons, Ernest and Frederick, shared the inheritance between\r\nthem. Ernest, the founder of the Styrian, and ultimately the dominant,\r\nbranch of the House, was called ‘the Iron’ on account of his physical\r\nstrength, and his marriage with Cymburga, a niece of the Polish king, is\r\nsaid to have brought the famous Hapsburg lip into the family. On his\r\ndeath in 1424 his two sons, Frederick and Albert, succeeded as joint\r\nrulers to Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola. Meanwhile Frederick, who had\r\nreceived Tyrol and the Swabian lands, had played a prominent part in the\r\nearly stages of the Council of Constance, and his territories had been\r\nconfiscated by Sigismund in 1415. But the imperial authority was not\r\nstrong enough to make the penalty permanent, and in 1417 Frederick\r\nrecovered his dominions with the approval and aid of his subjects. He\r\nlived till 1439, when he left a young son, Sigismund, to succeed him.\r\n\r\nThe death of the Emperor Sigismund gave rise to three problems of\r\nconsiderable magnitude. It extinguished a dynasty which had held the\r\nimperial crown for [Sidenote: Succession in Hungary and Bohemia.] nearly\r\na whole century, and it opened the succession in two kingdoms which were\r\nof supreme importance to Germany in her relations with the Slavs on one\r\nhand and with the Turks on the other. The House of Luxemburg had built\r\nup a unique territorial power on the eastern frontier of the empire, and\r\nit was very doubtful if it could be retained by any other family. In\r\nHungary little opposition was made to the accession of Albert V. of\r\nAustria, who had already won a reputation in the Turkish wars for valour\r\nand sagacity. But before his coronation he had to promise to refuse the\r\nimperial crown if it should be offered to him, a stipulation which shows\r\nhow little the Hungarians valued the connection with Germany. In\r\nBohemia, Albert had identified himself with the orthodox party, and\r\ncould reckon on its support. But the Hussites, still a majority of the\r\npopulation, were resolutely opposed to him, not only on religious\r\ngrounds, but also because his accession would continue the hated German\r\ndomination, and his claim ran counter to their contention that the\r\nBohemian crown was elective. The result was a renewal of civil war.\r\nAlbert was accepted and crowned by his partisans, while the Hussites\r\nsought to gain the general support of the Slavs by offering the crown to\r\nCasimir, the brother of Ladislas of Poland.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the electors in Germany had to fill the imperial throne. The\r\nreforming party, which had been stirred to activity by the disasters of\r\nthe Hussite war, was still in existence and still headed by Frederick of\r\n[Sidenote: Election of Albert II., 1338.] Hohenzollern. If they could\r\ncontrol the election, it might be possible to return to the policy which\r\nSigismund had pursued in his early years. Their desire was to choose a\r\nprince whose interests lay within Germany and not outside, and who would\r\nsacrifice any personal or family considerations for the general welfare.\r\nThe candidate whom they put forward was Frederick of Hohenzollern\r\nhimself, who had already given an example within Brandenburg of that\r\nreforming activity which was needed to put an end to the selfish and\r\ndistracting divisions of Germany. But the majority of the German princes\r\nwere little influenced by patriotic considerations. They valued\r\nindependence far higher than unity. It was no grievance to them that\r\nSigismund had neglected Germany since 1417, and had busied himself with\r\naffairs in Bohemia and Hungary. They turned their eyes to Albert V. of\r\nAustria, who seemed to occupy precisely the same position as Sigismund\r\nhad held in his later years. His immediate objects lay so far outside\r\nthe empire that he was not likely to interfere with princely\r\nindependence, while the pursuit of his own interests in the east might\r\nindirectly render no small service to Germany. Another and perhaps\r\ndecisive argument in Albert’s favour was that he had adopted that policy\r\nof neutrality in the struggle between Pope and Council which commended\r\nitself to most of the German princes. When the Electoral College met in\r\nMarch 1438, it was speedily evident that Albert had a secure majority in\r\nhis favour, and Frederick of Brandenburg gracefully withdrew his\r\ncandidature in order to allow the election to be unanimous. The election\r\ndoes not bulk very largely in either contemporary or later narrative,\r\nbut it was really of quite decisive importance. Until the fall of the\r\nHoly Roman Empire in 1806, with the exception of one short interval in\r\nthe eighteenth century, the Hapsburgs retained practically hereditary\r\npossession of the imperial crown. Under them Germany became a loose and\r\nineffective federation, held together by tradition and habit and by the\r\nascendency of a dynasty which showed remarkable astuteness and obstinacy\r\nin the pursuit of its own interests. The monarchy of the Ottos and the\r\nHohenstaufen had ceased to exist, and the traditions of Ghibellinism\r\nbecame an anachronism after 1438. The choice in that year lay between a\r\nHapsburg and a Hohenzollern; and it is of more than superficial interest\r\nto note that when the empire of the Hapsburgs had come to an end, when\r\nthe evils of disunion had at last worked their own cure, the first\r\nattempt to revive German unity was the election of a Hohenzollern to the\r\nthrone which the Hapsburgs had failed to fill.\r\n\r\nAlbert II., as he is called in the list of emperors, only accepted the\r\nproffered dignity with considerable reluctance, and was never able to\r\nvisit Germany, even for the [Sidenote: Death of Albert II.] purpose of\r\nbeing crowned. His first occupation was to enforce his claim in Bohemia\r\nagainst his rival, the Polish prince Casimir. With the aid of a German\r\nforce, Albert laid siege to Tabor, which was still the great Hussite\r\nstronghold. The besiegers were repulsed by a sally headed by a young\r\nBohemian noble, George Podiebrad; and though Albert was more successful\r\nin Silesia, where there was a large German element in the population,\r\nthe fate of Bohemia was still doubtful when he was called away by the\r\nnews that the Turks had invaded Servia and were threatening Hungary.\r\nLeaving his representatives with instructions to patch up a truce with\r\nPoland, Albert hurried to meet this new danger. But he wholly failed to\r\nrelieve Semendria, and his troops were decimated by dysentery contracted\r\nin the marshy valley of the Theiss. Albert himself was attacked by the\r\ndisease, and hurried homeward in the hope of seeing his capital and his\r\nwife once more. On the way he learned that his cause in Bohemia was\r\njeopardised by treachery, that the Council of Basel had revived the\r\nschism by electing Felix V. as anti-pope, and that the Turks were\r\nadvancing upon Belgrad, the key of Hungary. At this crisis, when\r\ndisaster or ruin seemed imminent from every side, Albert succumbed to\r\ndisease just as he had reached the outskirts of Vienna (October 27,\r\n1439). His death seemed to make the general confusion worse confounded.\r\nNot only was the empire again left without a head, but the\r\nrecently-established connection of Austria with Hungary and Bohemia was\r\ndissolved before it had had time to gain any strength, and it was\r\nextremely doubtful whether it would ever be restored. The only children\r\nborn to Albert and Elizabeth were two daughters, but Elizabeth was\r\npregnant at the time of her husband’s death, and until the child was\r\nborn any question of hereditary right must remain in abeyance. It will\r\nperhaps be clearer to consider the imperial election and the general\r\nhistory of Germany before turning to the tangled series of events which\r\nensued in Albert’s personal dominions.\r\n\r\nThe election of 1438 was too recent for any marked change to have taken\r\nplace in the balance of parties, and the principles which had then\r\nprevailed were re-affirmed [Sidenote: Election of Frederick III.] in\r\n1440 with even greater emphasis. In choosing Albert the electors could\r\nargue with some force that they were giving the imperial office to the\r\nstrongest candidate. Albert was the legitimate successor of the late\r\nemperor, and he was a powerful prince. Not only was he archduke of\r\nAustria, but he had been crowned king in Hungary and Bohemia, and though\r\nhe was opposed in the latter country he had a better claim than his\r\nopponent. Moreover, his personal character and his past achievements\r\ncommanded general respect. None of these arguments could be advanced in\r\nfavour of Frederick of Styria, who was now brought forward by the\r\nelectors who had supported Albert. In his father’s territories of\r\nStyria, Carinthia, and Carniola he was only joint ruler with his brother\r\nAlbert. He was barely twenty-four years old, so that little was known of\r\nhis character and abilities, but he had given no proof either of energy\r\nor capacity for affairs. But these considerations had no weight with men\r\nwho desired only a King Log, and Frederick was chosen by five votes to\r\ntwo on February 2, 1440. The rival candidate was Lewis of Hesse, who was\r\nput forward and supported by Frederick of Brandenburg. Events had\r\nconvinced the latter that in face of the jealous hostility of the house\r\nof Wettin neither he nor any member of his family had a chance of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nHis vote on this occasion was almost the last public act of the first\r\nHohenzollern elector of Brandenburg, though he received one more proof\r\nof the esteem in which [Sidenote: Death of Frederick I. of Brandenburg.]\r\nhe was held. A council of forty-seven was formed in this year to choose\r\na new king for Bohemia. Ten votes were split among several candidates,\r\nwhile thirty-seven were given for Margrave Frederick. But he was too old\r\nand too weary to entertain any new ambitions, and the flattering offer\r\nwas declined. On September 21, 1440, he died, leaving his territories to\r\nthe joint rule of his four sons. For nearly fifty years, ever since he\r\nsaved Sigismund’s life in the battle of Nicopolis, he had played a\r\nforemost part in German politics. He had met with failures as well as\r\ntriumphs, but he had always secured respect, both for distinguished\r\nability and for purity of motive. He was the last champion of the grand\r\nimperial traditions, which had really perished at the time of the Great\r\nInterregnum, though Henry VII. and, at one time, Sigismund had made an\r\neffort for their revival. It was fitting that Frederick should die in\r\nthe year in which the ideas which he represented met with their final\r\nreverse. But he was much more than the champion of the mediæval past. He\r\nwas the real creator of the modern state of Prussia, which has become\r\nthe centre of a revived German nationality, and has thus succeeded to\r\nsome extent in carrying out the schemes in the advancement of which its\r\ngreat founder spent his life.\r\n\r\nFrederick III., who held the German crown for fifty-three years, was\r\nalmost as inefficient a ruler as the drunken Wenzel, but his inaction\r\nwas due rather to set purpose than [Sidenote: Character of Frederick\r\nIII.] to incompetence. He is described by a German chronicler as\r\nhandsome and well built, of quick intelligence but of placid spirit,\r\nfond above measure of peace and quiet. Even the labours of the chase\r\nwere distasteful to him, and his chief delight was in architecture and\r\nthe collection of precious stones. By many he was considered a coward.\r\nHis acute contemporary, Philippe de Commines, calls him ‘the most\r\nperfectly niggardly man that ever lived.’ In another passage, however,\r\nCommines admits that his long experience of men had given him wisdom.\r\nThis was quite true. Frederick had none of the energy and decision of a\r\nstatesman who wishes to control the course of events. But he had the\r\nmerit of self-control, and a cheery confidence that patience and delay\r\nwould bring improvement, no matter how hopeless might seem the condition\r\nof affairs. His reputation for cowardice arose from his habit of evading\r\ndifficulties when he felt unable to face them. Thus, in 1451, when he\r\nwas threatened by a simultaneous rising in Austria and Styria, he left\r\nthe rebels to do their worst, and hurried off to Italy to receive the\r\nimperial crown. In 1473 he had his famous interview at Trier with\r\nCharles the Bold, who desired to receive the royal title. Unwilling\r\neither to grant the request or to exasperate the duke by a direct\r\nrefusal, the emperor escaped by night to Cologne. Such expedients were\r\nnot very dignified, nor were they calculated to produce any great\r\ntriumphs of statesmanship, but they were not ill suited to avoid fatal\r\ndisasters. In Germany Frederick was threatened with reforms which should\r\nannul the royal power, and even with deposition, yet he succeeded in the\r\nend in defeating his opponents. In his hereditary dominions he suffered\r\nmany humiliations; and at one time the greater part of Austria,\r\nincluding the capital, Vienna, had fallen into the hands of the\r\nHungarians. But at the time of his death, Frederick left the house of\r\nHapsburg infinitely more powerful than it had been at the time of his\r\naccession. The family territories, which had been subdivided since 1370,\r\nwere gradually re-united in the hands of the Styrian line. And the\r\nmarriage of his son Maximilian with Mary of Burgundy raised the\r\nHapsburgs to be one of the great dynasties of Europe, and prepared the\r\nway for still greater pre-eminence in the future.\r\n\r\nOf Germany as a state there is naturally very little history under a\r\nking who deliberately neglected his duties. For nearly thirty years\r\nFrederick III. remained obstinately [Sidenote: German opposition to\r\nFrederick III.] secluded in his own territories, and never visited any\r\nother part of Germany. Diets were held and matters of the gravest\r\nimportance debated, but neither entreaties nor threats could induce the\r\nemperor to attend. In the first great problem of his reign, the quarrel\r\nbetween the papacy and the Council of Basel, Frederick showed the most\r\ncynical disregard of national interests and prejudices. The pope was\r\nanxious to annul the pragmatic sanction of 1439, which had given some\r\nmeasure of independence to the German Church. Frederick allowed himself\r\nto be bribed into a secret treaty with the papacy, and the diplomacy of\r\nÆneas Sylvius Piccolomini was employed to divide and gain over the\r\nprinces and electors. Eugenius IV. lived just long enough to accept the\r\npreliminary treaty, and the final concordat was concluded with Nicolas\r\nV. (see p. 241). Equally discreditable, though less treacherous and\r\nself-seeking, was Frederick’s conduct when the news came that\r\nConstantinople had fallen before the Turkish attack. The pope and the\r\nemperor, as the joint heads of Christendom, were the natural leaders of\r\nresistance to the encroachments of the infidel. And Frederick III. had\r\nstrong personal and territorial interests at stake which he might\r\nconsider more important than the obligations of his high dignity.\r\nNicolas V. hastened to issue exhortations to a new crusade, and Æneas\r\nSylvius set himself to rouse the martial spirit of Germany. But\r\nFrederick III. shut himself up in his room, and with tears lamented the\r\ninstability of human greatness. The German diet met at Ratisbon in 1453,\r\nand at Frankfort in 1454, but the emperor would not appear, and in his\r\nabsence no decision could be come to. Bitter indignation was felt and\r\nexpressed at such pusillanimous inactivity. The archbishop of Trier,\r\nJacob von Sirk, who had never pardoned Frederick for his betrayal of the\r\nGerman Church to the papacy, took the lead of the opposition. With him\r\nwas allied the Elector Palatine Frederick the Victorious, who had\r\nsupplanted the infant nephew for whom he had been guardian, but had\r\nnever been able to obtain the imperial sanction for his usurpation. The\r\ndeposition of the emperor was discussed, and Philip of Burgundy, who\r\nprofessed great ardour for the projected crusade, was suggested as his\r\nsuccessor. Ultimately in 1455 a more practical scheme was put forward\r\nfor the creation of a central administrative body, in which the emperor\r\nmight appoint a deputy if he would not attend in person. This council,\r\nin which the electors would have preponderated, was to put down\r\ndisorder, to raise a revenue by an imperial tax upon clergy and laity\r\nalike, and was to take measures for the defence of the empire against\r\nthe Turks. The scheme came to nothing. Frederick III. opposed a passive\r\nresistance, and the archbishop of Trier was more interested to gain\r\npower and prominence for himself than to effect any real reform. In 1456\r\nMohammed II. laid siege to Belgrade, and the fall of the fortress would\r\nhave opened the whole valley of the upper Danube to the Turks. The\r\ndanger was warded off, not by the exertions of emperor or princes, but\r\nby the heroism and skill of a Hungarian soldier.\r\n\r\nWith the opposition to the emperor was combined hostility to the papacy.\r\nMany of the princes looked back with regret to the pragmatic sanction of\r\n1439, and envied the French who still retained the pragmatic [Sidenote:\r\nGerman hostility to the papacy.] sanction of Bourges. The death of\r\nNicolas V. in 1455 and the election of Calixtus III. gave an opportunity\r\nfor formulating the old complaints against the Roman see. Some of the\r\nelectors proposed to summon a new general council in a German city to\r\ntake up the work of ecclesiastical reform which the council of Basel had\r\nfailed to carry through. At the same time the reform of the imperial\r\nadministration was again mooted, and Frederick III. was called upon to\r\nattend a meeting of the diet. But the princes had ceased to be a united\r\nparty. Albert Achilles, the brother of the elector of Brandenburg, had\r\nquarrelled with the Elector Palatine, and now came forward as the\r\nsupporter of the emperor. The archbishop of Trier was dead and his\r\nsuccessor was gained to the side of Frederick III. The opposition\r\nleaders still threatened to depose the emperor, but they had no longer a\r\nmajority behind them. Frederick III. by a masterly inactivity had\r\nthwarted the projects of administrative reform, and thus set the seal\r\nupon German disunion. His triumph brought with it a victory for the\r\npapacy. Ecclesiastical tenths were constantly levied on the pretext of a\r\nTurkish crusade, but the money passed into the pope’s coffers. Half the\r\nbenefices in Germany were practically in the gift of the Curia. In 1459\r\nÆneas Sylvius became pope as Pius II. in succession to Calixtus III. In\r\n1460 he dealt a fatal blow to the conciliar opposition with which he had\r\nbeen so closely associated in earlier years. The bull _Execrabilis_\r\ndeclared any appeal from a papal decision to a general council to be\r\nimpious and heretical. From this time the opposition to the papacy in\r\nGermany was only weak and fitful until a new era began in the next\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nFor his inaction in Germany, Frederick III. had a fairly substantial\r\nexcuse in the constant troubles in which he was involved at home. Not\r\nonly had he to contend with the factious opposition of his brother\r\nAlbert and the Styrian nobles, but in 1439 the death of his uncle\r\nFrederick left him to act as guardian for the young Sigismund of Tyrol,\r\nand later in the same year he was called upon to deal with the very\r\nserious problems to which the death of Albert II. gave rise. As\r\nSigismund’s guardian, Frederick III. had to administer Tyrol and the\r\nSwabian territories, and the latter brought him into collision with the\r\nSwiss. For a long time jealousy had existed between the [Sidenote:\r\nFrederick III. and the Swiss.] rural cantons and the city members of the\r\nLeague, especially Zürich. This was brought to a head in 1436 by the\r\ndeath of the count of Toggenburg. His inheritance was claimed by the\r\nemperor, by the Confederation as a whole, and by Zürich. When the\r\ncitizens seized a large part of the disputed territory, the rest of the\r\nconfederates, headed by Schwyz, took up arms and compelled them to\r\ndisgorge their booty. It was the prominent part taken by the men of\r\nSchwyz on this occasion which helped to give their name to the whole\r\nConfederation. Indignant at the humiliation, Zürich drew aloof from the\r\nLeague and appealed to Frederick III. as both emperor and representative\r\nof the House of Hapsburg. Frederick could not resist the temptation to\r\nenforce the imperial claims to Toggenburg, and also to recover the\r\nAargau which the Swiss had taken from his uncle, Frederick of Tyrol, at\r\nthe time of his quarrel with the Emperor Sigismund. The war broke out in\r\n1442, and in spite of Frederick’s assistance Zürich was again closely\r\nbesieged by the forces of the Confederation. Unable to spare more troops\r\nfrom his own territories, Frederick resorted to the extraordinary\r\nexpedient of employing French mercenaries against his German subjects.\r\nCharles VII., freed for the time from his war with England, was only too\r\nglad to get rid of some of the _écorcheurs_, who had become a curse to\r\nFrance. Instead of the 5000 men whose services were demanded, he sent\r\nnearly 20,000 so-called ‘Armagnacs’ to invade Swabia under the nominal\r\ncommand of the dauphin. Devastation and misery marked the track of this\r\nvast force as it advanced to raise the siege of Zürich. A few hundred\r\nSwiss tried to block the way, and on the field of St. Jacob, the German\r\nThermopylæ, they were completely annihilated. But their heroism had\r\ngained its end. The invaders, who had suffered terrible losses, hastened\r\nto conclude a truce with such resolute foes, and retired to Alsace. In\r\n1445 they were induced to evacuate the country, but it was long before\r\nthe horrors of the raid were forgotten in Germany. Frederick III., who\r\nhad brought such sufferings upon his subjects, gained nothing by his\r\nunpatriotic action. The Swiss were more than ever determined to resist\r\nthe hated Hapsburgs to the last. The war went on till 1450, when Zürich\r\ndeserted the Austrian alliance and returned to the League. Frederick had\r\nto give up the guardianship of his cousin [Sidenote: Sigismund of\r\nTyrol.] Sigismund, who became independent ruler in Tyrol and the Swabian\r\nterritories. His subsequent history may be briefly traced. Involved in\r\nconstant quarrels with the Swiss, for which he was inadequately provided\r\nwith men and money, he pledged his Swabian lands in 1469 to Charles the\r\nBold. They proved as fatal a possession to the Burgundian duke as they\r\nhad been to the Hapsburgs. The wily Louis XI. gained one of his greatest\r\ndiplomatic triumphs when he reconciled the Swiss with Sigismund of\r\nTyrol, and stirred them up to make war against their powerful neighbour.\r\nAfter successive defeats at Granson and Morat, Charles the Bold fell in\r\n1477 before the walls of Nancy. Sigismund of Tyrol recovered his Swabian\r\ninheritance, but he had no children, and before his death in 1496 he\r\nhanded his territories over to Frederick III.’s son Maximilian, in whose\r\nhands all the Hapsburg territories were reunited.\r\n\r\nThe succession to Albert II. in Austria, Hungary, and Bohemia gave rise\r\nto a series of complications in the east, and involved Frederick III. in\r\nmany difficulties. Albert’s widow, Elizabeth, gave birth to a son,\r\nLadislas Postumus, on February 22, 1440. In [Sidenote: Succession in\r\nAustria, Hungary, and Bohemia.] Austria, where the rule of male\r\nsuccession was unquestioned, the infant duke was immediately\r\nacknowledged, and was placed under the guardianship of Frederick III.\r\nBut in Bohemia and Hungary, where Hapsburg rule was both novel and\r\nunpopular, the problem was by no means so easily settled. In Hungary\r\nthere was no absolute rule of inheritance, and female succession was not\r\nexcluded either by custom or law. Sigismund’s claim to the crown had\r\nrested on his marriage with the daughter of Lewis the Great, and Albert\r\nhad been accepted as the son-in-law of Sigismund. It was possible to\r\ncontend that there was no real vacancy, and that Elizabeth was lawful\r\nqueen. The primary need of Hungary was defence against the Turks, and in\r\norder to strengthen the kingdom the nobles compelled Elizabeth to offer\r\nher hand, and with it the Hungarian crown, to Ladislas III. of Poland.\r\nOn the birth of her son, Elizabeth repudiated the engagement, and had\r\nthe infant crowned king. But she was not strong enough to enforce her\r\nwill, and on her death in 1442 the Polish king was generally\r\nacknowledged in Hungary. But he perished in the great battle of Varna\r\nagainst the Turks in 1444, and in the following year the Hungarians\r\nreturned to the direct line and recognised Ladislas Postumus as king.\r\nBut he was still a minor in the guardianship of Frederick III.; and as\r\nthe Hungarians would not allow a foreigner to administer their kingdom,\r\nthey gave the office of governor in 1446 to John Hunyadi, who had won a\r\nbrilliant reputation in the Turkish war. Meanwhile, Bohemia had pursued\r\nits own course. The Utraquists, the most numerous and powerful party in\r\nthe kingdom, refused to recognise claims based upon hereditary right or\r\ndynastic treaties, and insisted upon the right of election. In all\r\nprobability they would have chosen the Jagellon king of Poland, if he\r\nhad not already been accepted in Hungary. The connection with Hungary\r\nwas no more popular than that with Austria. The crown was offered to\r\nFrederick of Brandenburg, but he would not have it, and in the end it\r\nwas decided to elect Ladislas Postumus as king, and to intrust the\r\nadministration during the minority to a council of Regency. But this\r\nsettlement of the succession failed to produce any harmony among the\r\ncontending parties. The Roman Catholics, headed by Ulrich von Rosenberg,\r\ndesired a complete reconciliation with Germany and the Papacy. The\r\nUtraquists, who found a capable leader in George Podiebrad, were\r\nresolute to maintain the national independence and the religious\r\nsettlement arranged in the _Compactata_ with the Council of Basel. A\r\nprolonged civil war ended in the Utraquist victory and the appointment\r\nof George Podiebrad as governor of Bohemia in 1452.\r\n\r\nThe Hapsburg rule in Hungary and Bohemia was nominally prolonged by the\r\nrecognition of Ladislas Postumus in his father’s dominions. But in\r\nactual fact there was [Sidenote: Ladislas Postumus.] little strength in\r\nthe connection, as each state arranged its own affairs with intentional\r\ndisregard of its fellows. To Frederick III., the guardianship of his\r\nyoung cousin brought little but incessant worries and annoyances.\r\nNeither Hungary nor Bohemia would allow him any authority whatever, and\r\neven in Austria Styrian administration was extremely unpopular. Both the\r\nAustrian nobles and John Hunyadi were urgent in demanding that Ladislas\r\nPostumus should be released from external tutelage and intrusted to the\r\ncare of his own subjects. George Podiebrad, on the other hand, who had\r\nno wish to jeopardise his own authority by the presence of a young king,\r\nwho might fall under the influence of his opponents, urged Frederick to\r\nmaintain his rights as guardian. In 1451 a simultaneous rising broke out\r\nin Austria and in Styria. Frederick III. chose this moment for a journey\r\nto Rome, to receive the imperial crown at the hands of the Pope. He\r\nendeavoured to checkmate the rebels by taking Ladislas Postumus with\r\nhim. The coronation, on March 19, 1452, was the last that was destined\r\nto take place in the ancient capital of the empire. On the emperor’s\r\nreturn to Germany, he was disgusted to find that his absence had only\r\nexasperated his opponents. The Austrian nobles entered Styria and\r\nattacked him in his own capital of Neustadt. Unable to resist any\r\nlonger, Frederick agreed in September 1452 to hand over his ward to the\r\nCount of Cilly, who carried him in triumph to Vienna.\r\n\r\nLadislas Postumus seemed to have a brilliant career before him, when he\r\nemerged from tutelage to be Duke of Austria and King of Hungary and\r\nBohemia. He was at the time in his thirteenth year, and he had only five\r\ntroubled years to live. Hungary and Bohemia remained under the\r\nadministration of Hunyadi and Podiebrad, but Ladislas was involved in\r\nquarrels with the two regents by the evil influence of the Count of\r\nCilly. It was still uncertain whether the young king would succeed\r\n[Sidenote: Relief of Belgrad, 1456.] in asserting his personal\r\nauthority, when the fall of Constantinople and the pressing danger from\r\nthe Turks compelled a temporary pacification. In 1456, Mohammed II. with\r\na huge army laid siege to Belgrade, and Turkish vessels sailed up the\r\nDanube to exclude any attempt to relieve the garrison by way of the\r\nriver. Hungary and south-eastern Germany would be exposed to invasion if\r\nthe great fortress were allowed to fall. For a moment, something like\r\nthe old crusading fervour was excited by the preaching of an\r\nenthusiastic Franciscan, Fra Capistrano, and Hunyadi undertook the\r\ncommand of the motley host that was collected by the eloquence of the\r\nfriar. A flotilla of rafts and boats was prepared, and the destruction\r\nof the Turkish ships, under the very eyes of the Sultan and his army,\r\nenabled the relieving force to enter Belgrad. But Mohammed II. refused\r\nto acknowledge his defeat. As a blockade was no longer possible, he\r\ndetermined to carry the fortress by storm. One by one the outworks were\r\ncarried by sheer force of numbers in spite of the heroic resistance of\r\nthe defenders. The crescent was about to be elevated to announce a\r\nsignal victory, when Hunyadi and Capistrano headed a last sally. The\r\nTurks were driven in headlong flight from the walls, their camp was\r\nstormed and burned, and before evening the Sultan’s army was in full\r\nflight for Sofia, leaving 20,000 men on the field (July 22, 1456). The\r\nrelief of Belgrade was a magnificent achievement, but it cost the life\r\nof the two leaders. Hunyadi died of camp fever on August 11, and a few\r\nweeks later Capistrano followed him to the grave.\r\n\r\nThe death of the Hungarian regent was welcomed by Count Cilly as\r\nremoving a rival from his path. But the great soldier had left two sons,\r\nLadislas and Mathias, who inherited their father’s popularity [Sidenote:\r\nDeath of Ladislas Postumus.] and might aspire to hold his position in\r\nthe state, and Cilly schemed to effect their ruin. Ignorant that his\r\nintrigues had been discovered, he accompanied the young king on a visit\r\nto the rescued fortress. No sooner were they within Belgrade than they\r\nfound themselves prisoners, and Cilly was brought before Ladislas\r\nHunyadi, reproached for his treachery, and put to death. Ladislas\r\nPostumus was shrewd enough to dissimulate his wrath and to pretend to\r\npardon the murderers. But he was only waiting his time. Early in 1457 he\r\nreturned to Pesth, and as soon as he had surrounded himself with his own\r\npartisans, he had Ladislas Hunyadi taken prisoner, tried and executed\r\nfor the murder of Cilly. Mathias, the younger brother, he carried off to\r\nVienna and thence to Prague. At the latter city he was preparing to\r\ncelebrate his marriage with Madeline, daughter of Charles VII. of\r\nFrance, when he died suddenly on November 23, 1457. So tragic an event\r\nmade a profound impression in Europe. Ladislas Postumus was too young to\r\nbe regarded as responsible for the demerits of his government, and his\r\nhandsome face and winning manners had always made him personally\r\npopular. In Vienna the news was received with paroxysms of grief, and a\r\nsuspicion was naturally entertained that the young prince had met with\r\nfoul play. That he should have died in Prague was almost conclusive\r\nproof of crime. German dislike of the Slavs and Roman Catholic\r\ndetestation of heretics combined to formulate the charge against George\r\nPodiebrad. Before long men told in detail how the poison had been\r\nadministered, its effects on the unfortunate victim, and the way in\r\nwhich the doctors had been suborned by the Bohemian regent. But there is\r\nnot the slightest foundation for these stories, and Ladislas\r\nunquestionably died of the plague or Black Death which devastated Europe\r\nat intervals throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nFor the second time within a few years the connexion between Austria,\r\nHungary, and Bohemia was dissolved, and as Ladislas Postumus left no\r\ndescendants, it seemed extremely unlikely that it would be renewed. In\r\neach of the three countries which he ruled he represented a different\r\ndynasty. In Austria he was the last of the Albertine line, and his death\r\nleft the primacy to the Styrian branch of the Hapsburgs. In Hungary he\r\nhad ruled, through the marriage of his grandfather Sigismund, as the\r\nultimate descendant of the Angevin dynasty, which had held the crown for\r\na century and a half. In Bohemia, through his mother Elizabeth, he\r\nrepresented the house of Luxemburg. Great interest attached to the\r\nsuccession. Austria, by family agreement, passed to the joint rule of\r\nthe three surviving Hapsburg princes, Frederick III. and his brother\r\nAlbert, and their cousin Sigismund of Tyrol. Such an arrangement gave\r\nrise to quarrels, which were only terminated by the death of Albert in\r\n1463, when Frederick III. bought off Sigismund with a money payment and\r\nassumed the undivided government of the Austrian duchy. In Hungary it\r\nwas decided to disregard all hereditary claims, and to fill the throne\r\nby free [Sidenote: Elections of Mathias Corvinus and George Podiebrad.]\r\nelection. On January 24, 1458, the choice of the diet fell upon Mathias\r\nCorvinus, the surviving son of Hunyadi, whose final exploit in relieving\r\nBelgrade had made him a national hero. In Bohemia a similar contempt was\r\nshown for dynastic or treaty claims, and the growing national sentiment\r\nfound expression in the election of George Podiebrad (March 2, 1458).\r\nThese two elections were events of no ordinary significance. They marked\r\na popular protest against dynastic arrangements which had paid no regard\r\nto national interests, and had so often brought about the rule of alien\r\nprinces. The practical assertion of the rights of the people, of the\r\nprinciple of nationality, and of the idea that merit rather than birth\r\nconfers a claim to rule, was a serious blow to the vested interests of\r\nEuropean kings and princes.\r\n\r\nThe termination of Hapsburg rule in Hungary and Bohemia was a bitter\r\ndisappointment to Frederick III., who had hoped to succeed his cousin in\r\nthese kingdoms. But as usual, his exertions were unequal to his\r\nambition; and after a futile struggle he was compelled to acknowledge\r\nhis successful rivals. Common interests drew the new kings together, and\r\nthe marriage of Mathias with the [Sidenote: War between Hungary and\r\nBohemia.] daughter of Podiebrad seemed likely to be the basis of a close\r\nand lasting alliance. Such an alliance would have been of the greatest\r\nvalue to Europe, and would have constituted a formidable barrier to\r\nTurkish aggression. George Podiebrad had already shown consummate\r\nstatesmanship in restoring order in the distracted state of Bohemia, and\r\nMathias soon proved that he had inherited no inconsiderable share of the\r\nmilitary skill and energy of his father. But unfortunately religious\r\ndifferences placed an impediment in the way of the concerted action of\r\ntwo princes who had no superior among the monarchs of their time.\r\nMathias was an orthodox member of the Church, while his father-in-law\r\nhad been born and bred a Utraquist, and had consistently directed his\r\npolicy to the maintenance of the Compacts of 1433. But these concessions\r\nto the Hussites had been extorted with difficulty from the Council of\r\nBasel, and successive popes were eager to restore uniformity of belief\r\nand ritual by their revocation. Pius II., encouraged by a confident\r\nexpectation of the revival of crusading ardour, ventured to annul the\r\nCompacts in 1462, and his successor, Paul II., in 1466 decreed the\r\ndeposition of Podiebrad as a heretic. The result of these papal measures\r\nwas to rekindle a religious war in Bohemia, and Breslau became the\r\ncentre of a rebellious Catholic league. But Podiebrad was well able to\r\nhold his own against domestic opposition, and the Pope, with the\r\nconnivance of the Emperor, set himself to obtain the active assistance\r\nof the Hungarian king. Mathias had no sympathy with heresy, his wife had\r\ndied in 1464, and he was tempted by the prospect of acquiring the\r\nBohemian crown for himself and of gaining the active support of the\r\nGerman states against the Turks. War broke out in 1468, but Mathias, in\r\nspite of occasional victories, gained little honour or substantial\r\nadvantage. In fact the chief result of hostilities was to deprive him of\r\nthe prospect of gaining Bohemia. George Podiebrad, driven by Hungarian\r\ninvasion to seek the support of Poland, suggested Ladislas, the son of\r\nCasimir of Poland, as his successor. The proposal was not unwelcome to\r\nthe diet. The sentiment of nationality was conciliated by the choice of\r\na Slav prince, and the only lingering sentiment of loyalty to the\r\nancient dynasty was gratified by the thought that Ladislas’s mother was\r\nthe younger daughter of Albert II. and Elizabeth of Luxemburg, and that\r\ntherefore some of the blood of Charles IV. ran in his veins. On the\r\ndeath of Podiebrad in 1471, Ladislas succeeded in attaining the crown in\r\nspite of all the efforts of Mathias to exclude him.\r\n\r\nMathias had good reason to suspect that the emperor, his professed ally,\r\nhad supported the candidature of Ladislas, and during the later part of\r\nhis reign he was engaged in almost continual hostilities with Austria.\r\nFrederick III. was no soldier, and for a time he was glad to purchase\r\nthe restoration of conquered territories by a money payment to his\r\nformidable neighbour. His attention was absorbed during a whole decade\r\nby the important events in the [Sidenote: Frederick III and Burgundy.]\r\nwest which preceded and followed the death of Charles the Bold. His\r\ngreat desire was to secure the hand of Charles’s daughter for his son\r\nMaximilian, but he must many times have despaired of achieving his end.\r\nIn 1473 he evaded by flight Charles’s imperative request for a royal\r\ntitle. In the next year he had to raise an imperial army in order to\r\nrelieve Neuss from the Burgundian besiegers, though he was careful to\r\navoid actual hostilities, and rejected the artful proposals of Louis XI.\r\nfor a partition of the territories of a common enemy. Yet he used his\r\ninfluence to bring about the war between Charles and the Swiss, which\r\nrestored to the Hapsburgs their ancient lands in Swabia, and in which\r\nCharles met with his defeat and death. Then at last Frederick found his\r\nopportunity. Pressed by the selfish aggression of Louis XI., Mary of\r\nBurgundy concluded the marriage with Maximilian which had been so long\r\ndebated, and brought to her husband the great Burgundian inheritance,\r\nthough the treaty of Arras (1482) shore off some provinces which Louis\r\nXI. would not relinquish.\r\n\r\nThis notable triumph was followed by an equally signal humiliation. The\r\nwar with Hungary was renewed, and Mathias Corvinus overran the whole of\r\nAustria and great part of Styria and Carinthia. In 1485 Vienna was\r\ncompelled to surrender, and Frederick III., driven from his [Sidenote:\r\nLast years of Frederick III.] capital, was forced to wander as an\r\nimperial mendicant from one German monastery to another. Yet the old man\r\nnever lost his cheerfulness or his confidence in the future. He refused\r\nto allow Maximilian to conclude a treaty in which any permanent cession\r\nof Austrian territory should be stipulated, and insisted upon waiting\r\nfor a favourable turn in the course of events. In 1486 he induced the\r\nelectors to choose Maximilian as King of the Romans, and thus secured\r\nthe continuance of the imperial dignity in his family. In 1490 Mathias\r\nCorvinus died leaving no legitimate heir to continue the line of\r\nHunyadi. Neither Frederick nor Maximilian could secure the succession,\r\nand the Hungarian diet offered the crown to Ladislas of Bohemia. But\r\nthough the extension of Jagellon power was in itself displeasing, the\r\nchange of rulers enabled the Hapsburgs to recover their losses. In 1491\r\nLadislas was compelled to sign the treaty of Pressburg, by which all the\r\nconquests of Mathias were restored, and it was arranged that on the\r\nextinction of his male line his territories should pass to the\r\nHapsburgs. By a series of chances, this condition was actually carried\r\nout within the next forty years. But the exertions of Maximilian to\r\nextort these terms from the Hungarian king had involved him in a great\r\nhumiliation in the west. The heiress of Brittany, to whom he had been\r\nactually married by proxy, was forced to give her person and her\r\nprovince to the French king Charles VIII., and his only daughter,\r\nMargaret, who had been for years betrothed to the latter, was repudiated\r\nand sent back to her father. But the wrong brought with it some\r\ncompensation when Charles VIII., in 1493, found it a necessary\r\npreliminary to his Italian expedition to conciliate his injured rival by\r\nthe restoration of Artois and Franche-Comté. The year before, Maximilian\r\nhad received Tyrol and Alsace from Sigismund, so that Frederick III.\r\nlived to see the Hapsburg dominions not only reunited in a single line,\r\nbut vastly extended. For some time he had allowed all power to fall into\r\nthe hands of his impetuous son, and little interest was aroused in the\r\nmidst of more exciting events by the news that the old emperor had died\r\non August 19, 1493. For years he had inscribed the five vowels as a\r\nmystic sign on all his buildings, books, and ornaments, and it appeared\r\nthat their significance was _Austriæ est imperare orbi universo_, or in\r\nGerman _Alles Erdreich ist Œsterreich unterthan_. The implied prophecy\r\nwas never literally fulfilled, but it came nearer to fulfilment than any\r\ncontemporary of Frederick III. could have anticipated. And to this\r\nresult the patient and rather ignoble diplomacy of the long-lived\r\nemperor contributed in no small degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n           THE HANSEATIC LEAGUE AND THE SCANDINAVIAN KINGDOMS\r\n\r\n\r\n    Relations of Germany in the fourteenth century with Scandinavians\r\n    and Slavs—The towns of southern and northern Germany—Unions of\r\n    German merchants abroad—Trade in the Baltic and the North\r\n    Sea—Alliance of Lübeck and Hamburg—Origin of the Hanseatic\r\n    League—Aggressions of Eric Menved—Collapse of Denmark and revival of\r\n    the League—Waldemar III. and the capture of Wisby—The Hanse towns at\r\n    war with Waldemar—Treaty of Stralsund—The League at the zenith of\r\n    its power—Queen Margaret and the Union of Kalmar—War between Denmark\r\n    and Holstein for the possession of Schleswig—Deposition of Eric of\r\n    Pomerania—Christopher of Bavaria re-unites the three\r\n    kingdoms—Christian I. of Oldenburg and the severance of Sweden from\r\n    the Union—Karl Knudson and the Stures—Christian I. acquires\r\n    Schleswig and Holstein—Gradual decline of the Hanseatic League.\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth century is not a period to which Germans look back with\r\npride or satisfaction. It produced no great [Sidenote: Relation of\r\nGermany with Scandinavians and Slavs.] rulers, like the Ottos, or\r\nFrederick Barbarossa, or Frederick II., who are the favourite heroes of\r\nGerman history in the middle ages. In their place we have Lewis the\r\nBavarian and his pusillanimous struggle with French popes, Charles IV.\r\nwith his subtle and cold-blooded policy which has been little understood\r\nor appreciated because it produced no great obvious results, and Wenzel,\r\nwhose drunken incompetence led to deposition and schism. There is an\r\nobvious decline of German power and prestige. The crowns of Italy and of\r\nArles confer upon their holder a nominal dignity as unreal as that of\r\nthe Roman Empire itself. The German kingship is more substantial, but\r\npossesses little efficient authority. The king’s influence depends more\r\nupon his private territorial possessions than upon his royal position,\r\nand his chief interest is in the aggrandisement of his family rather\r\nthan the extension of the powers of the crown. He cannot extort\r\nobedience from his powerful vassals, still less can he defend the\r\ndistant frontiers of his kingdom. Yet in spite of the impotence of the\r\ncentral authority, there were two points on the frontier on which the\r\ncause of Germany was championed with brilliant though not very lasting\r\nsuccess. To the north-west lay the Scandinavian kingdoms of Norway,\r\nSweden and Denmark, of which Denmark was the nearest and for a long time\r\nthe most powerful. The Danes were of German origin, and for generations\r\nthey had recognised the overlordship of German emperors. But they had\r\ngradually become severed from the southern members of their own race,\r\nand their interests and prejudices were in many respects anti-German.\r\nKnud VI. (1182-1202) repudiated any allegiance to the emperor, and the\r\nbreak-up of the Saxon duchy by Frederick Barbarossa destroyed the most\r\nefficient bulwark of northern Germany against Danish aggression.\r\nGeographical position enabled the Danes to claim a control of the\r\nBaltic, which more than one king from Waldemar II. (1202-1241) to\r\nWaldemar III. (1340-1375) sought to convert into absolute supremacy.\r\nResistance to a design which would have been disastrous to Germany was\r\nundertaken, not by the emperors, who showed a curious incapacity to\r\nappreciate the importance of the Baltic, but by the famous association\r\nof North German towns which is known as the Hanseatic League. Their\r\nmotive was neither patriotism nor a sense of nationality, but a selfish\r\npursuit of trading interests: nevertheless their action saved Germany\r\nfrom a serious danger. Farther east was a still greater problem. In the\r\nninth century the whole of the southern coast of the Baltic was\r\ninhabited by Slavs, who had displaced the earlier German settlers. With\r\nthe tenth century began a long struggle on the part of the Germans to\r\ndrive back this alien migration, or at any rate to extort submission and\r\nthe acceptance of Christianity from the conquered Slavs. Thanks to the\r\nexertions of two great families, the Welfs in Saxony and the Ascanians\r\nin Brandenburg, this task was in great measure accomplished by the\r\nthirteenth century. As far as the Vistula German preponderance had been\r\nestablished and secured by the introduction of German settlers and the\r\nfoundation of German towns. But to the east of the Vistula the struggle\r\nwas still going on, and it still involved religious as well as political\r\nand commercial interests. Here again, as in the north-west, the emperors\r\nwere absolutely inactive, and the Teutonic Order was left almost unaided\r\nto carry on a crusade in Lithuania and Livonia for the extension at once\r\nof Christianity and of German civilisation. These two very different\r\ncorporations, the Hanse towns and the Teutonic knights—with the equally\r\ndifferent Swiss Confederation in the south—are in many ways the most\r\ninteresting developments of German life in an age when Germany as a\r\nwhole was weak and anarchical.\r\n\r\nThe towns of Germany developed more slowly than the great Italian\r\nrepublics, and never attained to the same measure of independence or\r\nfame. Yet in many respects their history is similar. Both owed\r\n[Sidenote: The German towns.] their municipal self-government to the\r\nweakness of the central authority, and both owed their prosperity to an\r\nadvantageous position for carrying on trade. The great commercial\r\nroutes, by which the commodities made or collected in Italy were\r\ndistributed throughout central Europe, ran through southern Germany, and\r\nit was their position on these routes that gave importance to such towns\r\nas Ulm, Ratisbon, Augsburg, and Nürnberg. In the north an almost equally\r\nlucrative trade was conducted along the shores of the Baltic and the\r\nNorth Sea, and this trade was almost a monopoly in the hands of German\r\nmerchants. And the northern sailors had another source of wealth in the\r\nfishing industry, which was of special importance in the Middle Ages,\r\nwhen strict rules as to fasting were enforced by the Church. The\r\ncombination of trade and fishing brought prosperity to the great\r\nnorthern towns of Bremen, Hamburg, Lübeck, Rostock, Danzig, and many\r\nothers. Between the north and the south lay the great city of Cologne,\r\ninterested in the southern trade as it found its way along the Rhine\r\nvalley, and having also a large stake in the commerce with England and\r\nother countries bordering on the North Sea. But the real meeting-place\r\nof north and south was in the Flemish city of Bruges, whither merchants\r\nfrom all parts of Europe thronged to exchange their respective wares.\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth century is the golden age of the German towns, the period\r\nin which their wealth and political importance were higher than at any\r\nother period. But there is a marked and noteworthy distinction\r\n[Sidenote: Distinction between northern and southern towns.] between the\r\nnorthern and the southern groups. The great southern cities had many\r\ninterests in common with each other. They had to resist the growing\r\npower of the territorial princes, always jealous of municipal\r\nindependence; they were eager to put down disorder and private war; and\r\nobvious motives impelled them to oppose excessive tolls on roads and\r\nrivers and to obtain security for travellers. These interests, and\r\nespecially the need of police measures to put down robbery or to extort\r\nredress, induced them from time to time to form alliances among\r\nthemselves. But still stronger than community of interest was the\r\njealousy with which the cities regarded each other, and none of these\r\nleagues proved lasting. The dominant aim of the southern cities was\r\nindependence and isolation. In the north the sense of rivalry was\r\nequally strong, but the dangers and difficulties were in many ways\r\ngreater, and thus there was a more powerful impulse towards union. The\r\nsurrounding states were all of them more backward and less civilised\r\nthan the Germans; and this gave to the northern towns an infinitely\r\ngreater political influence than could be exercised by those of the\r\nsouth, which had to deal with powerful and highly developed communities.\r\nHence, while the southern cities could never combine together except for\r\na short time and an immediate object, those in the north gradually\r\nformed a league, faulty and ill adjusted in many ways, but which gave\r\nits members far greater importance than they could have acquired by\r\nisolated action, and even enabled them to play for a short time a\r\ndominant part in the politics of northern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe word ‘hansa’ is of some importance in the Middle Ages. In its\r\nearliest known use it means a band or troop of soldiers. Hence it\r\nacquires its later meaning of a union or association, especially for\r\nmercantile purposes. It is also used for the charge made by a superior\r\nauthority for leave to carry on trade. When Henry the Lion wished to\r\nencourage trade in his newly acquired town of Lübeck, he authorised\r\nforeign merchants to enter and leave it _absque theloneo et absque\r\nhansa_, ‘without tax or toll.’ But its most usual signification is\r\nassociation or guild; the _hansa_ is the merchant-guild, the _hans-hus_\r\nis the guild-hall. And it is in this sense that it came to be applied to\r\nthe great _Hansa_, the league of north German towns. The very name\r\nexpresses the important fact that the league of towns had its origin in\r\na league or leagues of traders.\r\n\r\nThe whole social and economic life of the Middle Ages is dominated by\r\nthe principle of association. The village community or manor is the most\r\nfamiliar illustration; the Church with its inner corporations is\r\nanother. In urban communities we find the same thing. Whoever wished to\r\npractise a handicraft must belong to a guild: whoever wished to engage\r\nin commerce must enter a trade-guild or _hansa_. The individual was\r\npowerless. Only through union with others did he obtain capacity of\r\naction and protection for his activity. Any comparison of the modern\r\nassociation with the mediæval union is as a rule superficial and\r\nmisleading. What is now a matter of use and advantage was then a matter\r\nof necessity, of actual if not of formal compulsion. The essential\r\ndistinction is to be found in the very limited area of state action in\r\nearly times. In the Middle Ages the corporation fulfilled most of the\r\nduties which the undeveloped state had neither the will nor the power to\r\nundertake.\r\n\r\nIf the home trader required an association, the merchant who journeyed\r\nto foreign countries needed one still more. There were few commission\r\nagents in the Middle Ages, and the merchant in person had to superintend\r\n[Sidenote: Unions of German merchants abroad.] the carriage and the sale\r\nof his goods. The perils of travelling by land were great; those by sea\r\nwere far greater. Pirates were almost as numerous and more difficult to\r\nresist than land-robbers, and the dangers of navigation were a very\r\nserious consideration when sailors had no compass to guide their course,\r\nand owners had no system of insurance to cover their risks. It was no\r\nwonder that traders desired to travel in considerable numbers in order\r\nthat perils and disasters might be avoided, or at the worst, chronicled.\r\nBut it was when the merchants reached a foreign soil that the necessity\r\nof union became most pressing. It often took a long time to dispose of a\r\ncargo; and as winter travelling was considered impossible, it was\r\nfrequently necessary to spend several months in a foreign land. Hence\r\nthe merchants combined to acquire joint property in the chief markets\r\nthey visited: not only inns for personal lodging, but warehouses for the\r\nstowage of goods, and harbourage for their ships. These ‘factories,’ as\r\nthey were called, became the central point of the union or _hansa_\r\nformed by the merchants. The mediæval system of law gave another impulse\r\ntowards combination. Law in early time was personal, not territorial; it\r\ndid not apply to all persons on the soil. The guest, as the foreigner\r\nwas called, if not altogether lawless, was yet at a great disadvantage\r\nas compared with the native. Any disputes among the foreign merchants\r\nhad to be settled among themselves and by their own law. In disputes\r\nwith natives it was difficult for them to obtain justice, unless they\r\ncould secure some powerful support within the state. To carry on trade\r\nat all they required privileges and concessions, which were not easily\r\nto be gained by individuals. All these considerations forced the\r\nmerchants to adopt a corporate organisation. At the head of the _hansa_\r\nwere elders or aldermen, who administered justice among the members,\r\nheld assemblies for the consideration of common interests, and\r\nrepresented the community in its relations with the outside world. The\r\nmore efficient this organisation was, the better able were the merchants\r\nto obtain privileges, especially the remission of duties upon trade,\r\nfrom the community with which they had to deal. The new-comer could only\r\nshare these privileges by obtaining admission to the _hansa_, and for\r\nthis he had to obtain the consent of the members and to pay a money fee.\r\n\r\nThe two chief scenes of mercantile activity in the north were the Baltic\r\nand the North Sea, connected with each other only by the narrow straits\r\nwhich separate the [Sidenote: Trade in the Baltic and North Sea.]\r\nislands and peninsulas of Scandinavia. The great centre of the Baltic\r\ntrade was Wisby, the capital of the island of Gothland. So important and\r\nflourishing was Wisby in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries that many\r\nmerchants took up their abode there; and though it remained a part of\r\nthe Swedish kingdom, it became to all intents and purposes a German\r\ntown. Thus an important distinction grew up between the German residents\r\nin Wisby and the older union of merchants, who only visited the town for\r\npurposes of trade. From Wisby factories were organised for the extension\r\nof eastern trade. Of these, by far the most important was at Novgorod,\r\nwhich became the great centre of trade with Russia. In the course of the\r\nthirteenth century the ascendency of Wisby in the Baltic was threatened\r\nby the rise of a group of towns upon territory which had been won back\r\nfor Germany from the Wends, the most westerly of the Slav settlers on\r\nthe Baltic coasts. These ‘Wendish’ towns, as they are called, though in\r\npopulation and character they were wholly German, were Lübeck, Rostock,\r\nWismar, Stralsund, and Greifswald; and among them Lübeck, thanks to its\r\nadvantageous position on the Trave and to the efficient patronage it\r\nreceived, played from the first by far the most prominent part. In the\r\nNorth Sea there were three great foreign markets to which German\r\nmerchants resorted, and where they formed _hansas_ of notable\r\nimportance. These were Bergen in Norway, London in England, and Bruges\r\nin Flanders. For a long time the majority of the North Sea traders came\r\nfrom Cologne, which was as predominant in the west as Wisby had become\r\nin the east. But other towns became rivals of Cologne, notably Hamburg\r\non the Elbe, and Bremen on the Weser. Even from inland towns, such as\r\nSoest, Dortmund, and Münster in Westphalia, merchants journeyed to the\r\ncoast and hired vessels for the conveyance of their goods to England or\r\nNorway.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that these unions of German merchants in foreign parts\r\nshould exercise a marked influence upon the conduct of the towns from\r\nwhich they came. [Sidenote: Influence of trade on the relations of the\r\ntowns.] The merchants were only occasional sojourners in their foreign\r\nabodes; the greater part of their lives was spent at home. And it is\r\nimportant to remember that the councils of most of the north German\r\ntowns were composed almost solely of merchants. Artisans were jealously\r\nexcluded and looked down upon, and there are few traces of a land-owning\r\nnobility in the German towns such as that which played a prominent part\r\nin the history of Florence and other Italian cities. Hence the policy of\r\nthe town councils was guided by the mercantile interests of their\r\nmembers. And the foreign _hansas_, if they failed to gain what they\r\nwanted, appealed for support to the towns from which the members came.\r\nThus when merchants were closely associated in trade, their towns were\r\nnaturally drawn into co-operation for common interests. This joint\r\naction for the furtherance of trade and the protection of the fisheries\r\ngave the first great impulse to the formation of town leagues. As long\r\nas the Baltic and the North Sea were fairly distinct units, the tendency\r\nwas to form two or more separate groups. The towns on the North Sea\r\ntended to group themselves round Cologne or Hamburg, while in the Baltic\r\none or two leagues might have been formed under the guidance of Wisby or\r\nof Lübeck. But a new era in the development of northern Germany set in\r\nwhen the Baltic towns began to encroach upon the North Sea trade, and\r\nwhen Lübeck undertook to dispute the primacy of Cologne in the west, as\r\nshe had already disputed the pre-eminence of Wisby in the east. The\r\ngreat struggle took place in London. Here German merchants had been\r\nactive since the reign of Æthelred II., one of whose laws enacts that\r\n‘the men of the emperor shall be held as worthy of good laws as\r\nourselves.’ These early traders must have come mostly from Cologne, and\r\nit was the men of Cologne who formed the first German _hansa_ in\r\nEngland. Other merchants had to obtain admission by payment to the\r\n_Hansa_ of Cologne, and gradually it expanded to admit most of the\r\ntraders from the Rhine and Westphalia. But natives of other districts\r\nfound it difficult to gain admission, and when the men of Lübeck\r\nappeared upon the scene they set themselves to break down the monopoly\r\nof Cologne. In this struggle they had the support of Hamburg, already a\r\nserious rival to Cologne, and possessed of a more advantageous site for\r\ntrade with England. When applicants had money and influence behind them,\r\nit was not difficult to obtain concessions from the English government,\r\nwhich found a pecuniary interest in the protection of foreign merchants.\r\nIn 1266 and 1267 Hamburg and Lübeck were allowed to form _hansas_ of\r\ntheir own on the model of that of Cologne. These were not in London, but\r\nat Lynn, a favourite port of the Germans on the east coast. In the early\r\nyears of Edward I. the three separate _hansas_ were fused into a single\r\n_Hansa Alamanniæ_, of which we first find official mention in the year\r\n1282. Its members were known to the English as the Easterlings or\r\nOsterlings, a name which they afterwards adopted for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe combination of all German merchants to form a single hansa in\r\nEngland is in many ways a very significant event. It marks a union\r\nbetween Baltic and North Sea [Sidenote: Alliance of Lübeck and Hamburg.]\r\ntraders, which for the first time rendered possible a general league of\r\nall the towns of northern Germany. It was brought about by the joint\r\naction of Lübeck and Hamburg, and there is a well-founded tradition\r\nwhich attributes to the alliance of these two towns the origin of the\r\nHanseatic League. For free trade between the Baltic and the North Sea it\r\nwas imperative, if possible, to secure the passage through the narrow\r\nchannels of the Sound and the Belt. But these were dominated by Denmark,\r\nwhich in those days held not only the peninsula of Jutland and the\r\nisland of Zealand, but also the southern provinces of what is now\r\nSweden. Geography enabled the Danes either to close the straits or to\r\nlevy a toll upon the vessels that passed through. Moreover, the great\r\ncentre of the herring fishery in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries\r\nwas the coast of Skaania, on the eastern side of the Sound. Here again\r\nthe Danes had it in their power to inflict damage upon the German\r\nmerchants and sailors who flocked to the coast of Skaania during the\r\nfishing season. Hence one of the most pressing needs of the north German\r\ntowns was to protect the straits and the fisheries from Danish\r\naggression, and the lead in this defence naturally devolved upon the two\r\ntowns which stood nearest to the barrier between the two seas—Lübeck to\r\nthe east of Jutland, and Hamburg to the west. The two towns were not\r\nvery distant from each other; and if, at the worst, the passage of the\r\nSound was blocked, a merchant could unlade his goods at either port,\r\ncarry them overland to the other, and thence renew his voyage either on\r\nthe Baltic or the North Sea. The earliest alliance between the two towns\r\nhad for its object the protection of the roads leading from one to the\r\nother, and from this they advanced to common action in England and in\r\nFlanders.\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder that other towns tended to ally themselves with the two\r\ncities which could and did render such invaluable services to a cause\r\nwhich was common [Sidenote: The origin of the Hanseatic League.] to all.\r\nBy the end of the fourteenth century we can find sufficient traces of\r\ncombination among the north German towns to justify the fixing of this\r\nas the date of the origin of the Hanseatic League. Lübeck was the more\r\nactive and enterprising of the two allies, and had the more commanding\r\nposition through her intimate connection with the Wendish and other\r\nBaltic towns, which were already united together by the acceptance of\r\nthe Lübeck laws. It was an obvious advantage for German merchants to\r\nhave a common legal system for the settlement of disputes in which any\r\nof them might from time to time be involved; and in spite of the\r\nopposition of Wisby, Lübeck had succeeded in procuring the adoption of\r\nits code by most of the eastern traders. The hegemony which was thus\r\nacquired within a limited area both fitted and encouraged Lübeck to\r\nundertake the leadership of a larger and more ambitious combination. It\r\nwas from Lübeck that invitations were issued to the other towns to send\r\ndelegates for the discussion of matters of common interests, and many of\r\nthe early meetings were held within its walls. In 1284 a complaint of\r\ninjuries received from Norway led to a decision of the towns at an\r\nassembly at Rostock to close all export and import trade with Norway\r\nuntil redress had been obtained. It was further determined to cease all\r\nintercourse with Bremen if that city should refuse to accept the\r\ndecision of the other towns. In 1293 a meeting of delegates from the\r\nSaxon and Baltic towns resolved that henceforth all appeals from\r\nNovgorod should be carried to Lübeck. Wisby was supported only by Riga\r\nand Osnabrück in opposing a resolution which recognised the ascendency\r\nof its rival. In 1300 the consideration of commercial grievances in\r\nFlanders was undertaken in a general assembly at Lübeck, to which all\r\nthe north German towns were invited from the mouths of the Rhine to the\r\nGulf of Riga.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of the fourteenth century the unions of German\r\nmerchants in foreign parts had lost their independence, and had become\r\nsubject to the control and guidance of the towns. But the combination\r\nthus created among the towns was in many ways incomplete. There was\r\nnothing like a federation involving permanent obligations upon its\r\nmembers. The meetings were only occasional, when any matter requiring\r\nsettlement arose, and there was a great variation in the number of towns\r\nrepresented, according as the matter was of general or local interest.\r\nWithin the large area over which the north German trading communities\r\nwere spread, there were many smaller combinations of towns, connected by\r\njoint action in the past, by agreements as to the use of common laws or\r\na common currency, or merely by local contiguity. These smaller\r\nassociations were older and possessed more consistency than any general\r\nleague. In fact, such a general league can hardly be said to have come\r\ninto existence; and so far as it was beginning to grow up, it was\r\nconcerned solely with commerce, and had no political significance\r\nwhatever. Some of the towns were free imperial cities, as Lübeck had\r\nbecome on the fall of Henry the Lion, whereas the majority were subject\r\nto a territorial prince. Under such conditions an efficient federation\r\nfor political purposes was impossible. This is illustrated by the\r\nhistory of the early years of the fourteenth century. In 1307 Lübeck,\r\nthreatened by the neighbouring [Sidenote: Aggressions of Eric Menved.]\r\ncount of Holstein, appealed for assistance to Eric Menved, king of\r\nDenmark, and actually acknowledged Danish suzerainty. Such an act on the\r\npart of the most flourishing German city on the Baltic shows how little\r\nany sentiment of nationality existed among the citizens. Eric was\r\nemboldened to attempt the recovery of that ascendency over the Baltic\r\ncoasts which his predecessor, Waldemar II., had for a time established\r\ntill it was overthrown at the battle of Bornhöved in 1227. In carrying\r\nout his aim he had to subdue the Wendish towns. Rostock and Wismar were\r\ncompelled to submit, and only Stralsund offered a successful resistance\r\nto the Danes. But the striking fact is that the towns rendered no\r\nassistance to each other. The whole episode proves that their union was\r\nlimited to the protection of mercantile interests. As long as the Danish\r\nking abstained from any attack upon German commerce, there was no\r\nmachinery for common action. Still it would seem that the loss of\r\npolitical independence brought with it a diminished ability to act\r\ntogether in any way. For some years after the submission of Lübeck we\r\nlose any traces of combination among the north German towns, and the\r\nforeign merchants were left once more to protect their own interests\r\nwithout any assistance or any control from the municipalities at home.\r\n\r\nBut this decline of the towns, which amounted almost to a dissolution of\r\nthe growing league, was as short-lived as the revival of Danish\r\npreponderance on the Baltic. [Sidenote: Decline of Denmark.] Eric Menved\r\nhad attempted a task beyond the resources either of his own ability or\r\nof his state. His extravagant and reckless policy forced him to purchase\r\nsupport by lavish grants of lands and privileges, and the consequent\r\ngrowth of a powerful nobility in Denmark proved a serious hindrance to\r\nlater kings. Eric himself died in 1319, and left his brother,\r\nChristopher II., to face the troubles for which he had been responsible.\r\nChristopher found it impossible to resist the combination of foreign\r\nattack with domestic rebellion. The whole of Denmark was lost, either to\r\nthe native nobles or to German invaders; while Skaania and the adjacent\r\nprovinces were seized by Magnus of Sweden, who had also obtained the\r\ncrown of Norway as the grandson of King Hakon. When Christopher died in\r\nexile in 1332 the Danish monarchy seemed for the next eight years to be\r\npractically extinguished. The sudden collapse of [Sidenote: Revival of\r\nthe League.] Denmark restored independence to the Wendish towns, and\r\nwith it revived the activity of the League. The anarchy and disorder in\r\nthe north during and after the reign of Christopher II. rendered the\r\nduty of defending trade-routes and fishing-stations more imperative than\r\never. Between 1330 and 1360 we find evidence of more and more regular\r\nmeetings of the town delegates; and it is in these years that the name\r\nof Hansa, hitherto used only for the mercantile unions in England and\r\nother foreign countries, came to be applied to the league of towns. In\r\n1358 an assembly was summoned of ‘all towns belonging to the Hansa of\r\nthe Germans,’ and the invitation was sent to Cologne and Wisby, to the\r\ntowns of Brandenburg, Saxony, Westphalia, Prussia, and Livonia. Already,\r\nin 1352, Magnus of Sweden speaks of ‘the merchants of the sea-towns,\r\ncalled hanse-brothers.’ The decrees of the assembly are binding upon all\r\nmembers, and the penalty is expulsion from the League and its\r\nprivileges. ‘If any town of the German Hansa shall refuse to observe\r\nthis,’ says one decree, ‘the town shall remain for ever outside the\r\nGerman Hansa, and shall be deprived for ever of German law.’ About this\r\ntime Bremen, which had been excluded ever since the quarrel with Norway\r\nin 1284, was restored to membership of the League. Within the wider\r\nassociation, which champions the interests of all north German traders,\r\nwe find distinct evidence of a recognised division into three parts for\r\nmore local purposes. The Wendish and Saxon towns under the leadership of\r\nLübeck constitute one division. Another is formed of the eastern\r\nsettlements in Gothland, Livonia, and Sweden, with Wisby as a sort of\r\ncapital; while a curious and unexplained combination of Westphalian and\r\nPrussian towns are grouped round Cologne. In 1347 an agreement was made\r\nthat each third should elect two elders every year to manage the German\r\ndepôt at Bruges. Thus by the middle of the fourteenth century we find\r\nthat the Hanseatic League has gained a definite organisation, although\r\nits functions are still limited to matters of trade, and have no\r\nstrictly political character. But events were soon to occur which were\r\nto try the stability of the League and to give it more political\r\nimportance than it had yet possessed.\r\n\r\nFor eight years after the death of Christopher II. Denmark was without a\r\nking, but in 1340 Waldemar III., Christopher’s youngest son, undertook\r\nthe task of recovering [Sidenote: Waldemar III and the capture of\r\nWisby.] his father’s dominions. He received the assistance of the\r\nWendish towns, which had no interest in the prolongation of anarchy,\r\nwhile they seized the opportunity to obtain a confirmation of their\r\nprivileges as the price of their help. They even watched with equanimity\r\nwhen, in 1360, he wrested the province of Skaania from the feeble hands\r\nof Magnus of Sweden. But they found that success had rendered Waldemar\r\nless easy to deal with than he had been in the days of his weakness, and\r\nthey had to pay a heavy sum for the renewal of their fishing rights.\r\nStill, the relations with Denmark were altogether peaceful when, in\r\n1361, the news arrived that a Danish fleet had sailed to the island of\r\nGothland, and that a Danish army had sacked the ancient town of Wisby,\r\nwhose wealth gave rise to the current phrase that the pigs ate out of\r\nsilver troughs. The old tradition assigned greed of plunder as the\r\nmotive for the raid. Later writers have suggested that it was merely the\r\ncontinuance of the quarrel with Sweden about Skaania, or that Waldemar\r\nintended to use the central position of Gothland for the purpose of\r\ncarrying out the ambitious plans of Waldemar II. and Eric Menved.\r\n\r\nThe delegates of the Hanse towns were assembled at Greifswald when the\r\nastounding news arrived. The action [Sidenote: First war with Waldemar\r\nIII.] of Waldemar created a wholly novel problem for a mercantile\r\nassociation to deal with. Wisby was subject to Sweden, and it was\r\nagainst Sweden that an act of open hostility had been committed. But\r\nWisby was also a great centre of German trade, its wealth had been\r\ncreated by Germans, and it was one of the chief towns of the Hanseatic\r\nLeague. It was instinctively felt rather than reasoned that it was\r\nimpossible to allow Waldemar’s action to pass without active resentment,\r\nand that the League must justify its existence by undertaking new duties\r\nand responsibilities. The assembly passed a decree forbidding all trade\r\nand intercourse with Denmark, and then adjourned in order to give time\r\nfor negotiations with Magnus of Sweden and his son Hakon, who had been\r\nsince 1350 independent king of Norway in his father’s place. On\r\nSeptember 7, 1361, the second meeting was held, and it was decided to go\r\nto war with Denmark in alliance with Sweden, Norway, and Holstein. For\r\nthe first time a federal tax was imposed, in the form of an export duty\r\nof fourpence in the pound, which was to be levied by all the towns until\r\nMichaelmas 1362.\r\n\r\nThe Hanse towns had promised to furnish two thousand men with the\r\nnecessary ships, and Sweden and Norway were to do the same. In April the\r\nHanseatic fleet sailed to the [Sidenote: Disastrous campaign of 1362.]\r\nSound under the command of John Wittenborg, the burgomaster of Lübeck.\r\nThe Swedish contingent failed to appear, but the Germans were persuaded\r\nby their allies to abandon the projected attack upon Copenhagen and to\r\nlay siege to Helsingborg, a strong fortress on the coast of Skaania. Too\r\nmany of the sailors had been taken from the ships in order to press the\r\nsiege, when Waldemar suddenly appeared with the Danish fleet. He at once\r\nattacked the ships of the League—sunk some, and carried off the rest\r\nwith their cargoes and the remnant of their crews. Wittenborg had\r\nperforce to abandon the siege, and returned home to pay the penalty for\r\nfailure with his life. The disaster was as terrible as it was\r\nunexpected, and the towns considered themselves lucky to be able to\r\nconclude a truce in November for fourteen months, during which trade was\r\nto be resumed and no new charges were to be imposed by the Danish king.\r\nBut there was no security that Waldemar would observe his promises,\r\nespecially when he succeeded in depriving the Hanse towns of their\r\nallies. Magnus and Hakon had never been eager for the war with Denmark,\r\nwhich was really the work of the nobles in the Swedish Council. The\r\nCouncil had arranged a marriage between Hakon and the daughter of the\r\ncount of Holstein, but Waldemar seized the lady as she was on her way to\r\nSweden, and kept her a prisoner until the match was broken off. In 1363\r\nhe persuaded Hakon to marry his own daughter Margaret, and thus laid the\r\nfoundation for the future union of the three kingdoms. This marriage was\r\na serious blow to the League, which seemed to be on the verge of\r\ndissolution. The Wendish towns had been most active in the war, and\r\nwould have been the chief gainers by its successful issue. Upon them\r\ninevitably fell the chief blame for the disaster. The Prussian towns\r\nrefused to pay the export duty; they said that they had granted it for\r\nthe protection of the Sound, but the Sound was now less protected than\r\never. It was quite useless to make the obvious reply that Lübeck and its\r\nneighbours had spent far more and lost far more, and that their losses\r\nincluded men as well as money.\r\n\r\nIf Waldemar had behaved with statesmanlike prudence and moderation, he\r\nmight have permanently weakened, if not destroyed, the League, which was\r\nthe chief [Sidenote: Temporary peace.] obstacle in his way. If once the\r\nmore distant towns had been convinced that their interests in Danish\r\nwaters were as secure after defeat as they had been before, they would\r\nhardly have adhered to an alliance which proved costly as well as\r\nuseless. But Waldemar was eager to deprive the German traders of all the\r\nprivileges they had obtained through the weakness of Denmark since the\r\ndays of Eric Menved, and this danger served to keep the Hanse towns\r\ntogether in spite of their discouragement and their quarrels with each\r\nother. Before the truce had expired, Waldemar set out at the end of 1363\r\non a long tour to the principal courts of Europe. During his absence the\r\nDanish Council agreed to prolong the truce, but it seemed almost\r\nimpossible to arrange any permanent peace upon terms that the German\r\nmerchants could accept. It was still doubtful whether the towns would\r\ngive way or venture on a renewal of hostilities, when events in Sweden\r\ncompelled the Danes to moderate their demands. The Swedish nobles had\r\nlong been alienated by the feeble government of Magnus. They had\r\nresented the loss of Skaania and the humiliating conquest of Gothland.\r\nTheir fierce indignation was roused by the change of policy in 1363,\r\nwhen the Holstein alliance was abandoned and Hakon was married to\r\nMargaret of Denmark. In 1364 they declared Magnus deposed, and elected\r\nin his place Albert, the second son of the duke of Mecklenburg, and of\r\nEuphemia, a sister of Magnus. The elder brother was passed over because\r\nhe had married Ingeborg, another daughter of Waldemar III., and the\r\nSwedes would have no connection with Denmark. A civil war followed, in\r\nwhich the forces of Magnus and Hakon were defeated, and the former was\r\ntaken prisoner. The greater part of Sweden acknowledged Albert. When\r\nWaldemar returned from his travels, he found his plans checkmated by\r\nthis Swedish revolution, and resolved to overthrow the new dynasty in\r\nalliance with his son-in-law Hakon. In order to prepare for this new\r\nwar, he concluded the treaty of Wordingborg in September 1365 with the\r\nHanse towns. Freedom of trade through the Sound and a confirmation of\r\nGerman privileges on the coast of Skaania were granted, but only for a\r\nperiod of six years. It was obviously a truce rather than a real treaty;\r\nneither side was satisfied with its terms; and the inevitable struggle\r\nbetween Danish and German interests in the Baltic was only postponed.\r\n\r\nThat Waldemar, in attacking the new king of Sweden, was influenced by\r\nwholly selfish motives, is proved by the treaty [Sidenote: Second Danish\r\nwar.] which he concluded in July 1366 with the duke of Mecklenburg. In\r\nreturn for the formal cession of Gothland and other considerable\r\nterritories, he abandoned the cause of Magnus and Hakon, and agreed to\r\nrecognise and support Albert and his successors in the remaining\r\nprovinces of Sweden. This unprincipled policy raised Denmark to a\r\ngreater height of power than it had reached since the days of Waldemar\r\nII. Emboldened by success, the king did not scruple to break his recent\r\nagreement with the Hanse towns. In the course of 1367 several German\r\nships were seized and plundered in the Sound, and increased tolls were\r\nlevied upon vessels resorting to the coast of Skaania for the fishing\r\nseason. Even the distant south-western towns, which had taken hardly any\r\npart in the previous war, felt that these outrages were intolerable, and\r\nclamoured for active measures in defence of their trade and industry. It\r\nis significant of the greater unanimity of the League on this occasion\r\nthat the decisive meeting was held, not as usual in a Baltic town, but\r\nat Cologne. There in November 1367 it was decided to go to war with the\r\nDanish king; and if any town should hold aloof from the common cause,\r\n‘its burghers and merchants shall have no intercourse with the towns of\r\nthe German Hansa, no goods shall be bought from them or sold to them;\r\nthey shall have no right of entry or exit, of lading or unlading, in any\r\nharbour.’ A new export duty was imposed for a year, and the sum raised\r\nwas to be divided among the towns in proportion to the contingent which\r\neach furnished. To avoid the quarrels which had followed the last\r\ncampaign, it was expressly enacted that no injury or loss on the part of\r\nany town should give it a claim upon the others for compensation. All\r\nprivileges or other advantages which should be gained in the war were to\r\nbelong equally to all the members of the League.\r\n\r\nIt was a formidable array of enemies that Waldemar had to face in 1368.\r\nHis treaty with the duke of Mecklenburg [Sidenote: triumph of the\r\nLeague.] had come to nothing, because the Swedes refused to sacrifice\r\ntheir own interests to their new dynasty, and would not surrender the\r\nstipulated territories. So Waldemar had to renew both the alliance with\r\nHakon and the war with Albert of Sweden. On the mainland both\r\nMecklenburg and Holstein were on the side of his enemies, the nobles of\r\nJutland were on the verge of rebellion, and now he had provoked the\r\nHanse towns to a new campaign. In the presence of these dangers he\r\nadopted an extraordinary course of action. In April 1368 he placed all\r\nhis accumulated treasure upon a ship, and sailed to Pomerania, leaving\r\nthe Danish Council to govern the kingdom during his absence, and to\r\ncarry on the war which he had provoked. For two years he wandered about\r\nEurope from one court to another, while his dominions were overrun by\r\nhis enemies. The Hanseatic fleet appeared in the Sound soon after the\r\nking’s departure, and at once attacked Copenhagen. The town was taken\r\nand destroyed, and the fortress was occupied by a German garrison. From\r\nZealand the victorious traders turned to Skaania, and by the end of the\r\nyear every fortress, except the redoubtable Helsingborg, had fallen into\r\ntheir hands. It was decided to keep their forces in the field during the\r\nwinter and to prolong the tax on exports for another year. In 1369\r\nHelsingborg surrendered after an obstinate resistance, and the Danes,\r\nattacked also from Holstein and Mecklenburg, opened negotiations with\r\nthe Hanse towns. Hakon of Norway had already concluded a truce by which\r\nall the rights and privileges of German merchants in his kingdom were\r\nconfirmed. On [Sidenote: Treaty of Stralsund.] May 24, 1370, the Treaty\r\nof Stralsund put an end to the Danish war. For fifteen years all the\r\ncastles and fortified places on the coast of Skaania were to be held by\r\nthe League, which was to receive two-thirds of the revenue of the\r\nprovince in order to cover the cost of their maintenance. These terms,\r\nwhich transferred the control of the Sound and its fisheries from\r\nDenmark to the Hansa, were to be confirmed by Waldemar as the condition\r\nof his return to his kingdom. No future king was to be placed on the\r\nDanish throne without the consent of the Hanse towns and until he had\r\nconfirmed all their privileges and concessions.\r\n\r\nThe second Danish war marks an important epoch in the history of the\r\nHanseatic League. Not only was it raised to the position of an\r\ninfluential power in northern [Sidenote: The League at the zenith of its\r\npower.] Europe, but its whole character had undergone an important\r\nchange. Hitherto it had been a mercantile league for the extension and\r\nstrengthening of trade privileges, and for the settlement of trade\r\ndisputes. The decisions of the Cologne assembly in 1377 had superadded\r\nto this mercantile association a political and military alliance. It is\r\ntrue that that alliance was in express terms only temporary and for the\r\nachievement of an immediate object—the protection of the narrow waters\r\nfrom outrage and oppression. But the new obligations which success\r\nbrought to the League gave to the Cologne decrees a more permanent\r\nimportance than had been contemplated at the time of their adoption. The\r\noccupation of the forts on the Sound conceded by the treaty of\r\nStralsund, and the necessity of constantly watching the changes and\r\nstruggles in the Scandinavian kingdoms—a necessity which was all the\r\nmore pressing after the Union of Kalmar—compelled the League to maintain\r\nan armed force in constant readiness, and to continue the collection of\r\na federal revenue for military purposes. When new towns applied for\r\nadmission to the League, and there were many such applications in the\r\nyears following the Treaty of Stralsund, they had to accept, not only\r\nthe old conditions as to trade, but also the more stringent obligations\r\nimposed by the assembly at Cologne. Thus the League became more\r\nconcentrated and more highly organised than it had been before the war.\r\nThe federal assemblies were more frequent, and their sessions were\r\nlonger and more full of business. Every year there was a general\r\nassembly at midsummer, but there were also frequent provincial meetings,\r\nespecially of the Wendish towns, which continued to form the most\r\ncentral and the most influential unit within the League. And not only\r\nwas the external activity of the League greater, but it began to concern\r\nitself with the internal affairs of its members. In the fourteenth\r\ncentury the ascendency of the merchants in municipal government was\r\nthreatened by the rise of the artisans in Germany, as it was in Florence\r\nand other southern towns. The Hanseatic League, essentially mercantile\r\nin its origin and its aims, naturally made itself the champion of the\r\nold exclusive oligarchy. In 1374 a rising took place in Brunswick\r\nagainst the ruling council: some of its members were executed, and the\r\nrest were driven into exile. For this offence Brunswick was formally\r\nexpelled from the League, and its merchants were excluded from all the\r\nmarkets under its control. This mercantile excommunication was now a\r\nformidable weapon, and the men of Brunswick had to make humble\r\nreparation for their democratic aspirations before they could obtain\r\ntheir readmission to the confederacy. But in emphasising the greater\r\nunity and greater influence of the League after its victory over\r\nWaldemar III., it is imperative to remember that there were several\r\ndefects and weaknesses in its federal constitution. The very wide extent\r\nover which the towns were spread, from the Scheldt to the Gulf of\r\nFinland, and the jealousy which mercantile rivalry must almost\r\ninevitably create, rendered any complete real unity of interest and\r\npurpose almost impossible. There was never any assembly at which all the\r\ntowns were represented, and, in fact, it would be difficult to give a\r\nprecise enumeration of the members of the League at any given date.\r\nSometimes several towns would combine to give authority to a single\r\ndelegate, but no town considered itself bound to take part in the\r\nmeeting. Not infrequently the delegates would declare that their\r\ninstructions did not allow them to consent to a proposal, and that they\r\nmust refer the matter back to their respective town-councils. Hence\r\narose uncertainty and delay. But the chief defect was that membership of\r\nthe League was not and could not be the only political obligation of the\r\ntowns. Most of them were subject to some immediate authority, usually\r\nthat of a territorial prince. Thus they had a double allegiance, and the\r\ntwo might come into collision with each other. The princes might allow\r\ntheir towns to gain trading privileges by joining the League, but they\r\nwere not likely to consent to any diminution of their own authority.\r\nUnder such conditions it is wonderful that the League held together as\r\nlong as it did.\r\n\r\nThe increased dignity and importance of the Hanseatic League after the\r\nTreaty of Stralsund are illustrated by the action of the emperor.\r\nCharles IV., as is shown [Sidenote: Charles IV and the League.] in the\r\nGolden Bull, disapproved of confederations of towns and of the rapid\r\ngrowth of municipal independence. Waldemar III. was his personal friend,\r\nand during the recent war the emperor had more than once endeavoured to\r\nuse his influence in behalf of the Danish king. But in 1373 Charles had\r\nobtained Brandenburg from the last Wittelsbach Margrave (see p. 120),\r\nand thus acquired a new interest of his own in the politics of northern\r\nGermany. He was now eager to conciliate the League and to obtain the\r\nprivileges which it could give to the towns of his new dominion. In 1375\r\nhe left Prague to pay a visit to Lübeck, where the magnificence of his\r\nreception made a profound impression on contemporaries. Tradition\r\ndeclared that he began his speech in acknowledgment of civic hospitality\r\nwith the words ‘My Lords’; and when the burgomaster shook his head to\r\ndeprecate such a title, the emperor continued: ‘You are Lords! The old\r\nimperial registers prove that Lübeck is one of the five chief towns of\r\nthe empire; that your city councillors are also imperial councillors;\r\nand that they may enter his council without waiting for his permission.’\r\nThe chronicler complacently adds that the five chief towns were Rome,\r\nVenice, Pisa, Florence, and Lübeck.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Stralsund was followed by a general restoration of peace\r\nin the north. Waldemar III. returned to his kingdom, and obtained the\r\nrestoration of the Mecklenburg conquests by a treaty with Duke Albert,\r\nwho had established one son on the throne of Sweden, and now hoped with\r\nWaldemar’s support to gain Denmark for his grandson. In 1371 the long\r\nstrife between Sweden and Norway came to an end. On condition that\r\nMagnus and Hakon should abandon all claims to the Swedish crown, Albert\r\nagreed to release the former from his imprisonment and to allow him an\r\nannual income till his death, which [Sidenote: Death of Waldemar III.]\r\noccurred three years later. The most pressing question in the north was\r\nthe succession to Waldemar in Denmark. His only son had died in 1363, so\r\nthat Waldemar was the last male of his dynasty. Of his two daughters who\r\nhad lived to become brides, the elder, Ingeborg, had married Henry of\r\nMecklenburg, the elder brother of the reigning king of Sweden, and the\r\nyounger, Margaret, had married Hakon of Norway. Thus the choice lay\r\nbetween two children—Albert, the son of Ingeborg and Henry, and Olaf,\r\nthe son of Hakon and Margaret. The Mecklenburg claimant was recognised\r\nas his heir by Waldemar, and had the support of the Emperor Charles IV.\r\nand of the powerful count of Holstein. But the Danes had not forgotten\r\nthe rule of the German invaders in the time of Christopher II.; and when\r\nWaldemar died in 1375, they elected the five-year-old Olaf as his\r\nsuccessor. Both by treaty rights and by actual power the Hanse towns\r\nwere entitled to a voice in the decision, and they seem to have\r\npreferred the possibility of a union between Denmark and Norway to an\r\nextension of the already formidable power of the House of Mecklenburg.\r\nOlaf was acknowledged by the League, and one of his first acts was to\r\nconfirm the provisions of the Treaty of Stralsund.\r\n\r\nIn 1380 Hakon of Norway died, and Olaf wore his father’s crown in\r\naddition to that of Denmark. During his minority his mother Margaret\r\nruled in both kingdoms. [Sidenote: Queen Margaret and the Union of\r\nKalmar.] In 1386 she found it necessary to conciliate the count of\r\nHolstein by the cession of Schleswig, which was to be held as a fief of\r\nDenmark; but in other respects her government was so successful, that on\r\nher son’s death in 1387 she was invited to succeed him by the Danes and\r\nNorwegians. At the same time she received an offer of the crown of\r\nSweden. The government of Albert of Mecklenburg, who had rewarded his\r\nGerman followers with lands and offices, had excited great ill-will\r\namong the Swedish nobles, whose power was more than a match for that of\r\nthe king. The conquest of the distracted kingdom proved a comparatively\r\neasy task. At Falköping in 1389 Albert was completely defeated, and\r\nafter seven years’ imprisonment he could only procure his liberty by\r\nabdication. Stockholm, aided by forces from Mecklenburg, held out for\r\nsome years; and the famous association of the _Vitalien-Brüder_, or\r\n‘Victualling Brothers,’ originally formed for its relief, became a\r\nformidable body of pirates in the Baltic. The interference which they\r\ncaused to trade induced the Hanse towns to employ their mediation in\r\nfavour of Margaret, who became queen of the three Scandinavian kingdoms.\r\nHer great ambition was to render this union permanent. As she had no\r\nsurviving child of her own, she adopted Eric of Pomerania, the grandson\r\nof her sister Ingeborg. In 1397 she convened the councils of the three\r\nkingdoms to Kalmar, and induced them to agree to a formal act of union.\r\nThe three kingdoms were to be irrevocably united under the same king,\r\nand the election of successors to the crown was limited to the\r\ndescendants of Eric. Each state was to retain its own laws and\r\ninstitutions, but treaties with foreign powers were to be binding upon\r\nall. The arrangement had one obvious defect. No single electing body was\r\ncreated; and if each kingdom could choose a king, even within the limits\r\nof a single family, there was no security that their choice would fall\r\nupon the same person.\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth century was a troubled period in the history of northern\r\nEurope, but its events are far less interesting and far less important\r\nthan those of the fourteenth century. There were two great questions at\r\nissue: Whether the Union\r\n\r\nof Kalmar could be permanent, and whether the Hanse towns could retain\r\neither their unity of action or the preponderance in the north which it\r\nhad given them. Both questions remained in doubt during the century, but\r\nultimately both were answered in the negative. To maintain the union of\r\nthe three Scandinavian kingdoms, which had no great love for each other,\r\nwhile in two of them a powerful noble class had obtained a considerable\r\nmeasure of independence, would have required either exceptional good\r\nfortune or exceptional ability, and the successors of Margaret had\r\nneither. Even the ‘Union Queen’ herself made a serious blunder in her\r\nlater years. Count Gerhard of [Sidenote: War between Denmark and\r\nHolstein.] Holstein, to whom she had granted Schleswig, as a hereditary\r\nfief, died in 1404, leaving a young son Henry to succeed him. Encouraged\r\nby her previous triumphs, Margaret could not resist the temptation of\r\ntrying to escape from the bargain she had made in 1386, and to gain\r\nSchleswig for the crown. Various claims to the duchy were put forward on\r\nbehalf of Denmark, but the Schauenburg princes were resolute in support\r\nof Gerhard’s son. The struggle lasted for thirty years, and in the\r\ncourse of it most of the north German states became involved. Margaret\r\ndied suddenly in 1412, but Eric of Pomerania continued to maintain the\r\nclaims which his great-aunt had put forward with the mingled obstinacy\r\nand violence which marked his character. The authority of the king of\r\nthe Romans was called in to settle the dispute, and twice Sigismund gave\r\na formal decision in favour of the Danish crown. But as had happened\r\nmore than once before, the Hanseatic League showed a greater regard for\r\nthe interests of Germany than the German king. Hamburg, closely\r\nassociated with Holstein, from the first supported the House of\r\nSchauenburg, and gradually Lübeck and the other Hanse towns were\r\ninvolved in the war against Eric. Their intervention, combined with\r\ndisturbances in Sweden, turned the balance; and in 1435 Adolf of\r\nHolstein, who had succeeded his brother Henry in 1428, was recognised as\r\nduke of Schleswig.\r\n\r\nThe war with Holstein was not only unsuccessful, it also involved Eric\r\nin serious domestic difficulties. Sweden and Norway, which required the\r\nconstant attention of the king, were left unvisited and unregarded. In\r\nDenmark, Eric could only induce the nobles to serve in a war in which\r\nthey had little interest by lavish concessions which further weakened\r\nthe royal authority. In all the kingdoms discontent was excited by\r\nincreased taxation and by debasement of the coinage. Another grievance\r\nwas furnished by Eric’s partiality for his Pomeranian relatives, and his\r\navowed desire to secure the succession to his cousin, Boguslav. In 1434\r\nthe first rising took place in Sweden among the peasants of Dalecarlia,\r\nbut Eric succeeded in conciliating Karl Knudson, the leader of the\r\nnobles, who was appointed Marshal of the kingdom, and in 1435 the Union\r\nof Kalmar was confirmed by the Swedish diet. But the king’s neglect of\r\nthe duties of government had become intolerable, and in 1439 he was\r\nformally deposed [Sidenote: Deposition of King Eric.] by the Danish\r\nCouncil. As neither of the other kingdoms had the slightest desire to\r\nsupport Eric, this act rendered vacant the three Scandinavian thrones.\r\nThe deposed king lived for another twenty years, but he never had any\r\nchance of recovering the dignity he had forfeited.\r\n\r\nThe Danes proceeded in 1439 to offer the crown to Christopher of\r\nBavaria, whose mother was a sister of Eric, [Sidenote: Christopher of\r\nBavaria.] and he accepted it upon conditions which narrowly limited the\r\nroyal power. One of his first acts was to settle the dispute about\r\nSchleswig by confirming the duchy to Adolf of Holstein as a hereditary\r\nfief. The action of Denmark had no binding force upon the other\r\nkingdoms, but lavish bribes to Karl Knudson and the clergy purchased the\r\nacceptance of the Swedish diet; and Norway, which had shown less enmity\r\nto Eric than the other states, was induced to follow the example of its\r\nneighbour. In 1442 Christopher was recognised in the three Scandinavian\r\nkingdoms, and the Union of Kalmar was continued for another generation.\r\nIn 1446 he strengthened his position by marrying Dorothea of\r\nBrandenburg, but no heir had been born to continue the Bavarian dynasty,\r\nwhen Christopher was carried off by a sudden death in January 1448.\r\n\r\nWith the death of Christopher the severance of the kingdoms seemed to be\r\ninevitable. There was no obvious heir to any one of them, and it was\r\nhardly possible that they should combine to find the same [Sidenote:\r\nSeverance of Sweden.] successor. Sweden and Denmark were the first to\r\nact, and neither paid the slightest regard to the proceedings in the\r\nother. In Sweden there was a strong party hostile to the union; and an\r\norganised demonstration on the part of the mob led to the hasty election\r\nof Karl Knudson, who had been for years the most powerful and wealthy\r\nnoble of the kingdom (June 1448). Meanwhile the Danes had offered the\r\ncrown to Adolf, count of Holstein and duke of Schleswig. He refused the\r\noffer, but suggested the choice of his sister’s son, Christian of\r\nOldenburg, who could claim descent from a daughter of Eric Glipping, the\r\npredecessor and father of Eric Menved. Christian was accepted, but the\r\nconditions which were imposed upon him gave the chief control of the\r\ngovernment to the council of nobles. And he also had to pay for his\r\nuncle’s support by a formal document, in which assurance was given that\r\nthe duchy of Schleswig or south Jutland ‘shall never be united or\r\nannexed to the kingdom of Denmark, so that one person shall be lord of\r\nboth.’ In Norway, less energetic and independent than the other two\r\nkingdoms, there was a prolonged struggle as to whether the Danish or the\r\nSwedish king should be chosen. Karl Knudson believed that he had assured\r\nhis own election, and he actually assumed the crown in Trondhjem, but\r\nthe party which supported the Danish connection proved the stronger, and\r\nin August 1450 the diet decreed the permanent union of Denmark and\r\nNorway.\r\n\r\nDenmark and Norway remained united under the Oldenburg dynasty until the\r\nlatter was combined with Sweden by the [Sidenote: Christian I. recovers\r\nSweden.] decision of the allies in 1815. It would probably have been\r\nbetter if Christian I. had abandoned all idea of recovering Sweden. But\r\nthe Union of Kalmar was not to perish without giving rise to a long and\r\nexhausting struggle. Many of the Swedish nobles were jealous of the\r\nelevation of Karl Knudson to royal rank, and the archbishop of Upsala\r\nheaded an opposition party which appealed for Danish intervention.\r\nChristian could not resist the temptation of gaining a third crown. In\r\n1457 Karl Knudson was forced to flee to Danzig. Christian was crowned at\r\nUpsala, and his son John or Hans was acknowledged as his heir. This\r\nsuccess was followed by another conspicuous triumph. In 1459 the death\r\nof Adolf of Holstein [Sidenote: Schleswig and Holstein.] and Schleswig\r\nextinguished the male line of the chief branch of the House of\r\nSchauenburg. Christian could advance a double claim to the vacant county\r\nand duchy. He was the nearest relative of his uncle Adolf on the female\r\nside, and he could contend that Schleswig as a Danish fief escheated to\r\nthe overlord on the extinction of the family to which it had been\r\ngranted. On the other hand, the surviving Schauenburg princes claimed to\r\nbe the nearest male heirs, and they could point to Christian’s own\r\npledge in 1448 that Schleswig should never be united to the Danish\r\ncrown. The dispute enabled the estates of the two provinces to exercise\r\npowers which had never hitherto belonged to them. On condition that\r\nSchleswig and Holstein should remain united, and that they should be\r\nfree to elect any member of the family and not be bound to take the\r\nsuccessor to the Danish throne, they accepted Christian as duke and\r\ncount in March 1460. The Schauenburg princes were bought off by a money\r\npayment. In 1479 the Emperor Frederick III. raised Holstein from a\r\ncounty to a duchy, and granted the formal investiture to Christian I.\r\n\r\nGood fortune had suddenly raised the House of Oldenburg to an\r\nextraordinary preponderance of territorial power in the north. No\r\nprevious ruler had succeeded in uniting the [Sidenote: Independence of\r\nSweden.] three Scandinavian kingdoms with two considerable provinces on\r\nthe mainland. But the real strength of Christian I. was in no way\r\nproportioned to its appearance. He had purchased every state by\r\nconcessions which sapped the very foundations of the central authority.\r\nIn Sweden especially his kingship was merely nominal. The strong\r\nnational sentiment of the Swedes objected to the Union of Kalmar\r\nbecause, in spite of stipulated equality, it made their state little\r\nmore than a province of Denmark. The archbishop of Upsala, whose quarrel\r\nwith Karl Knudson had given the crown to Christian, was really more\r\npowerful than the king. Disputes were inevitable, and in 1467 Karl was\r\ninvited to quit his exile in Danzig and to resume possession of the\r\ncrown. On his death in 1470, his nephew, Sten Sture, was proclaimed\r\nregent of Sweden. Christian led an army to compel his submission, but\r\nwas completely defeated and driven from the kingdom. For the next half\r\ncentury a succession of Stures ruled Sweden in practical independence.\r\n\r\nSweden was not the only territory that was lost to Christian I. In 1469\r\nhis daughter Margaret was married to James III. of Scotland; and the\r\nOrkneys and Shetlands, which had been in the hands of Denmark since the\r\ntenth century, were pledged to the Scottish king as security for the\r\nprincess’s dowry. As the pledge was never redeemed, the islands were to\r\nall intents and purposes ceded to Scotland. The death of Christian in\r\n1481 left his dominions to his eldest son John. The new king was\r\nweakened by having to divide Schleswig and Holstein with his younger\r\nbrother Frederick, and by an unsuccessful war which he carried on to\r\nextort the submission of the independent peasants of Ditmarsh. Thus\r\nthough he was able for a time to recover Sweden and to assume the crown,\r\nhe could not retain his hold upon the kingdom. Sten Sture regained the\r\ngovernment in 1500, and after his death it was transmitted to his\r\nsuccessors, Svante Sture and a younger Sten. The desperate effort of the\r\nnext Danish king, Christian II., to restore the Kalmar Union, and the\r\ncruelty which he displayed in the famous ‘blood-bath of Stockholm’ only\r\nled to the final vindication of Swedish independence by Gustavus Vasa.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the fifteenth century had been a period of difficulty and\r\nstress to the Hanseatic League. The Union of Kalmar in itself\r\nconstituted a serious danger [Sidenote: Gradual decline of the Hanseatic\r\nLeague.] to the north German towns. The privileges which they had\r\nextorted from the Scandinavian rulers amounted to a practical monopoly\r\nof trade and fishing rights along their coasts. The obvious interest and\r\nduty of a really strong ruler would impel him to repudiate such\r\nrestrictions on the freedom of his subjects. Fortunately for the League,\r\nthe Union was never much more than nominal. The policy of the Wendish\r\ntowns was steadily directed to place difficulties in the way of the\r\nScandinavian rulers, and to encourage every tendency to independence in\r\nthe subject provinces. Thanks to the weakness of the successive kings\r\nand the turbulent opposition of the Swedes to the Union, this policy was\r\nsuccessful, and the Hanse towns were enabled to retain for a time their\r\npolitical and mercantile ascendency in the north. But in spite of this\r\nthe century was on the whole a period of decline in the history of the\r\nLeague. The weaknesses which were inherent in the coalition from the\r\nfirst became more and more visible. Foreign competition, especially that\r\nof the English, was a constant and increasing source of trouble. In the\r\nfourteenth century the Germans still had a preponderant share of the\r\nimport and export trade of England. In the fifteenth century the native\r\ntraders steadily set themselves to get the better of the privileged\r\nforeigners, and by the reign of Henry VII. the English had established a\r\nconsiderable direct trade, not only with Flanders and Norway, but also\r\nwith the countries on the Baltic. But foreign competition was a less\r\nserious danger than internal weakness and disruption. In the course of\r\nthe fifteenth century a notable change began in the balance of northern\r\ntrade. At first the western towns of the League had been for the most\r\npart engaged in trade in the North Sea, whereas the eastern towns had\r\ncarried on their trade in both the North Sea and the Baltic. In the\r\nfifteenth century the western towns, and especially those of the\r\nNetherlands, began to encroach upon the Baltic trade and entered into\r\nrivalry with Lübeck, Rostock, Stralsund, and Danzig. This growing\r\nimportance of the western and non-Baltic merchants was completed by two\r\nchanges which could neither be foreseen nor controlled. For more than a\r\ncentury the gregarious herrings had made the coast of Skaania their\r\nfavourite summer resort, and in consequence this had been the scene of\r\nthe largest and most lucrative fishing industry in Europe. In the middle\r\nof the fifteenth century the fish made one of those sudden and\r\ninexplicable changes of habitat, which have more than once affected the\r\nsocial and economic relations of the northern states. They ceased to\r\nenter the Baltic in any large numbers, and transferred themselves to the\r\ncoast of Holland. The privileged position in Skaania for which the Hanse\r\ntowns had struggled so long and so successfully became all at once\r\nalmost valueless, and the gains of the Dutch were measured by the losses\r\nof the Wendish and other Baltic towns. This change was followed by the\r\ngreat geographical discoveries which began at the end of the century.\r\nThese had the effect of transferring the great trade routes from\r\nEuropean waters to the outlying oceans, and this proved as fatal to the\r\ntowns on the Baltic as it was to those on the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nCommercial jealousy and the growth of wholly separate interests of their\r\nown impelled the towns of the Netherlands to independent political\r\naction, which in the end led to the severance of their connection with\r\nthe League. Thus in the war waged by King Eric to gain possession of\r\nSchleswig the chief Hanse towns supported Holstein, but the\r\nNetherlanders sent assistance to Eric in order to gain a share in those\r\ncommercial privileges in the Scandinavian kingdoms which Lübeck and its\r\nimmediate associates tried to keep in their own hands. Also it must be\r\nremembered that the Netherlands became less German as they fell under\r\nthe rule of the Valois dukes of Burgundy. There was no formal rupture of\r\nvassalage to the empire, but practically there was complete independence\r\nof control, and the new rulers directed the conduct of their subjects to\r\nsuit their own ends. This points to the fundamental weakness of the\r\nHanseatic League, which led to its gradual dissolution in the course of\r\nthe next century and a half. If Germany could have been made into a\r\nsingle united state, the League, as the champion of common German\r\ninterests, might have had a prolonged existence. But Germany became a\r\nvery loose federation of territorial princes, and in such a state there\r\nwas no room for an active and efficient league of towns. The local\r\nprince would not allow the burghers within his dominions sufficient\r\nindependence to make their membership of such a league a reality. As the\r\nprovinces became more compact, the towns were withdrawn from their\r\nfederal allegiance and tied down to their direct duties as subjects of\r\nthe prince. This gradual process destroyed the Hanseatic League. A few\r\nimperial cities, as Lübeck, Hamburg, and Bremen, retained the name of\r\nHanse towns till the present century, but the name was used to express\r\nindependence rather than union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n                     THE TEUTONIC ORDER AND POLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n    Foundation of the Teutonic Order—Struggles of Germans and Slavs in\r\n    the Baltic provinces—The Knights are invited to Prussia—Their\r\n    conquests—Quarrel with the Papacy and complete transfer of the Order\r\n    to Prussia—Further territorial acquisitions—The Order at the height\r\n    of its power under Kniprode—Union of Poland and Lithuania—The Battle\r\n    of Tannenberg—Decline of the Order—Internal discontent and disorder\r\n    in Prussia—The Prussian League—Civil war and Polish conquest—The\r\n    Peace of Thorn—End of the Teutonic Order and of the Order of the\r\n    Sword.\r\n\r\nThe great Emperor Frederick Barbarossa died in Asia Minor as he was\r\nleading his forces to take part in the Third Crusade. The German army\r\nbroke to [Sidenote: Foundation of the Teutonic Order.] pieces after the\r\nloss of its leader, and only a few scanty fragments reached Palestine to\r\ntake part in the siege of Acre (1189). The besiegers were decimated by\r\nthe diseases to which troops are liable in an unaccustomed climate, and\r\ncomplaints were made that the German sick were neglected in such scanty\r\nhospital arrangements as then existed. Under the pious care of some\r\nmerchants from Lübeck and Bremen, an order was formed to combine the\r\nfunctions of soldiers and nurses. The ‘German Knights of St. Mary’\r\nborrowed most of their rules from the Hospitallers or Knights of St.\r\nJohn, but some of their military regulations were adopted from the still\r\nmore famous Order of the Temple. In 1191 the new crusading order\r\nreceived a bull of confirmation from Pope Clement III., and the first\r\ngrand-master fixed his headquarters in Acre, which had now fallen before\r\nthe assaults of the Crusaders. Its origin and its peculiarly national\r\ncharacter were emphasised by the limitation of membership to men of\r\nGerman birth and speech. Like the Templars and Hospitallers, the\r\nTeutonic knights were the recipients of numerous gifts and bequests from\r\npious benefactors, and acquired considerable estates in western Europe.\r\nBut crusading ardour had begun to decline in the West, and the Germans\r\nhad never taken quite as prominent a part in the movement as the Romance\r\nnations. If the activity of the Teutonic Order had been confined to\r\nPalestine, it is not likely that its existence could have been either\r\nprolonged or important. But within forty years from its foundation a new\r\nsphere was provided for its military exertions.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the twelfth century immense strides had been made by\r\nChristianity and German civilisation [Sidenote: Germans and Slavs.]\r\namong the Slavonic peoples to the south of the Baltic. Bohemia and\r\nPoland, the two outposts of the Slavs to the south-west, had been\r\nconverted and brought into some sort of submission to the German\r\nEmperors. Their most thriving towns were filled with German settlers;\r\nand some of the border provinces, such as Silesia, had already received\r\na preponderantly German element in their population. To the north-west\r\nthe efforts of Henry the Lion and Albert the Bear had conquered and\r\nconverted the Wends; Lübeck and other towns had been founded to serve as\r\ncentres of German commerce and German influence; and bishoprics had been\r\ncreated for Mecklenburg and Pomerania. But from the valley of the\r\nVistula to the Gulf of Finland there stretched an immense tract of\r\ndreary country, alternately sandy wastes and undrained marsh, in which a\r\nnumber of Slavonic peoples—Prussians, Lithuanians, Esthonians, and\r\nLivonians—still lived their primitive life, engaged in hunting, pasture,\r\nand rudimentary agriculture. They retained their heathen religion and\r\ntheir ancient customs, and were regarded by their more advanced\r\nneighbours as little better than savages. In the tenth century St.\r\nAdalbert of Prague had met with a martyr’s death as he sought to preach\r\nthe Gospel to the Prussians, and ever since there had been a nominal\r\nbishopric on the eastern Baltic, but its holders had never ventured to\r\nreside in their diocese.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century a vigorous effort was made to extend\r\nChristianity among these eastern Slavs. [Sidenote: Teutonic knights\r\ninvited to Prussia.] The Bishop of Riga founded in 1200 the Order of the\r\nSword to compel the acceptance of the faith by the people of Livonia.\r\nSoon afterwards Christian, a Cistercian monk of Oliva, undertook to\r\npreach the Gospel among the Prussians. The Pope gave him the title of\r\nBishop of Prussia; and a Polish duke, Konrad of Masovia, who claimed the\r\nborder district of Kulm, promised him active assistance. But the task\r\nproved beyond the powers of duke and bishop. The Prussians rose against\r\nthe intruders, destroyed their settlements, and carried fire and sword\r\ninto the Kulmerland and Masovia itself. This war between the Christian\r\nand the heathen Slavs gave occasion for the introduction of the Teutonic\r\nknights into Prussia. In 1226 an embassy from Konrad of Masovia appeared\r\nbefore the grand-master in Italy, and offered to cede the Kulmerland if\r\nthe Order would undertake to defend him from the Prussians.\r\n\r\nHermann von Salza, who was grand-master at the time, was an intimate\r\nadviser of the Emperor Frederick II., who had given the black eagle of\r\nthe empire as the Order’s standard, and a man of no small importance in\r\nthe politics of southern Europe. Endowed with equal energy and\r\nforesight, he welcomed the opportunity of founding a new Christian state\r\nin the north, where greater security and distinction could be gained\r\nthan in upholding a losing cause in the Holy Land. But he had no\r\nintention of fighting the battles of the Polish duke or the Prussian\r\nbishop without adequate reward, and he took the most painstaking\r\nprecautions to secure the independent rule of the Order in what was\r\ndestined to be its future home. Frederick II., who knew little and cared\r\nless about the fate of the Baltic provinces, was easily induced to grant\r\nto the Order a formal investiture of the district of Kulm with all\r\nfuture conquests in Prussia. This was followed by treaties with the Duke\r\nof Masovia and with Christian of Oliva, whose original alliance had been\r\nbroken by their rival claims to suzerainty; and finally, to remove any\r\ndifficulties with Rome, Pope Gregory IX. was persuaded to claim the\r\nlands of the heathen as the property of St. Peter, and to grant them to\r\nthe Order on payment of a nominal tribute (1234).\r\n\r\nIn 1231 the first detachment of Knights entered Prussia and commenced\r\nthe work of conquest. In spite of their smaller numbers, their superior\r\narms and [Sidenote: Conquest of Prussia.] discipline gave them an\r\nimmense advantage over the disorderly hordes which opposed them. As each\r\ndistrict was reduced to submission, a fortress was built to enforce\r\nobedience and to serve as a base for further operations. Thus, in the\r\nfirst few years, Thorn, Kulm, and Marienwerder were built and garrisoned\r\nin rapid succession. In 1237 the Knights of the Sword agreed to form a\r\nclose alliance with the Teutonic Order, of which they became a\r\nsubordinate branch, though retaining a considerable measure of autonomy.\r\nThus the heathen were threatened with attack on both sides—on the west\r\nfrom the valley of the Vistula, and on the north-east from Riga and the\r\ncoast of Livonia. But the rapid successes of the Knights provoked\r\njealousy and opposition. The Poles were indignant at the establishment\r\nof a German state between their own borders and the Baltic, and\r\npolitical and race antipathy soon overpowered the original alliance on\r\nreligious grounds. Konrad of Masovia bitterly repented his shortsighted\r\ncession of Kulmerland, and both from Poland and from Pomerania aid was\r\nsent to the heathen Prussians. Even the bishop, Christian of Oliva, was\r\nalienated by the Order’s assumption of ecclesiastical independence, and\r\ndid his utmost to enforce his own claims to superiority in the conquered\r\ndistricts. But the Papacy remained loyal to the warrior priests, whom it\r\nregarded as submissive vassals. The usual indulgences were offered to\r\nall who would undertake the pious duty of joining a crusade against the\r\nheathen, and crowds of recruits were induced to secure their temporal\r\nprosperity and their future salvation by fighting in the service of the\r\nKnights. The most famous of the princely allies was Ottokar of Bohemia,\r\nthe lord of Austria, and the most powerful of German princes in the\r\nmiddle of the thirteenth century. In 1255 he led a large army into\r\nPrussia, and the fortress of Königsberg was named in his honour.\r\n\r\nBut the conquest of Prussia was not achieved without difficulties and\r\nreverses. In 1260 a general rising was organised among the Slav\r\npopulation, and for the next ten years the Knights were in serious\r\ndanger of losing all they had gained. But their dogged resolution\r\nprevailed in the end, and by 1280 the land had once more been forced\r\ninto sullen submission. The desperate struggle had seriously diminished\r\na population which was always thinly scattered over a huge area. To fill\r\nthe place of those who had fallen or had migrated eastwards to preserve\r\ntheir independence in Lithuania, the Order encouraged the settlement of\r\nGerman peasants and German burghers. The conquest of Prussia was a\r\nvictory for Germany as well as for Christianity. The Slavs had to accept\r\nthe religion and the language of the conquerors.\r\n\r\nThe end of the thirteenth century ushered in a period of trial for the\r\ngreat crusading orders. The fall of [Sidenote: Quarrel with the Papacy.]\r\nAcre in 1291 marked the ultimate failure of the attempts to recover the\r\nHoly Land for Western Christendom. The military associations were\r\ndiscredited by their ill-success; and while they lost their hold upon\r\npopular favour, their immense wealth excited the avarice of the temporal\r\nprinces. The Papacy had fallen from the lofty position which it had held\r\nin the time of Innocent III., and was forced to become the accomplice\r\nand the agent of the royal spoilers. The Templars were first persecuted\r\nand then suppressed by Philip IV. of France and his creature Pope\r\nClement V. The Knights of St. John only escaped a similar fate by\r\nthrowing themselves into Rhodes, and by holding the island as a bulwark\r\nof Christendom against the encroaching Mohammedan power. The position of\r\nthe Teutonic Order was as insecure as that of their older and, for a\r\ntime, more prosperous rivals. The grand-master had removed his\r\nheadquarters from Acre to Venice, and thence could watch the approach of\r\ndanger. When, in 1309, Clement V. issued a hostile bull against the\r\nOrder, the Knights were prepared with a practical and efficient answer.\r\nThe only way to prove their strength and their value to Europe was to\r\nconcentrate their undivided energies upon the work which had been\r\nundertaken on the Baltic coast. The hostility of a distant Pope would\r\nthere be comparatively impotent, and they could strengthen themselves by\r\na close alliance with the interests and forces of Germany. It was, no\r\ndoubt, a great sacrifice for the Knights to abandon a residence in\r\nsouthern Europe, where they had enjoyed considerable wealth and\r\ninfluence, and to bury themselves in a [Sidenote: Transference of the\r\nOrder to Prussia.] remote and barbarous district in the inclement north.\r\nBut there was no other alternative if they would escape destruction; and\r\nin 1309 the grand-master transferred his residence from Venice to\r\nMarienburg, which became henceforth the headquarters of the Order.\r\n\r\nThe severance of the Teutonic Order from all connection with Palestine\r\nand its concentration in Prussia had many important results. The close\r\nconnection which had been hitherto maintained with the Papacy was\r\nweakened, and the ties with Germany and the Empire were drawn closer.\r\nHenry VII. hastened to assure the Knights of his protection and to\r\nconfirm their rights and privileges. Hitherto they had conquered in the\r\nname of the Church, henceforth their triumphs are to be for the\r\nextension of Germany. And these triumphs were for a time proportioned to\r\ntheir increased unity and strength. In 1311, by dexterously taking\r\nadvantage of a dispute between Brandenburg [Sidenote: Acquisition of\r\nPomerellen.] and Poland, they seized the district of Pomerellen on the\r\nleft bank of the Vistula, which contained the important city of Danzig.\r\nThis acquisition enormously strengthened the position of the Order on\r\nits western or German border; but, at the same time, it led to the long\r\nand desperate struggle with Poland which ultimately brought disaster in\r\nits train. And the conquest illustrates the changed attitude of the\r\nOrder, for which the quarrel with the Papacy was partially responsible.\r\nIts aims have become political rather than religious. It is no longer\r\nsolely absorbed in the task of forcibly converting the heathen, but can\r\nturn aside to the pursuit of self-aggrandisement at the expense of its\r\nChristian neighbours.\r\n\r\nThe Papacy, which had been so enthusiastic a supporter of the Teutonic\r\nOrder in the thirteenth century, was on the side of Poland in the\r\nfourteenth. But its ecclesiastical [Sidenote: The Order at the height of\r\nits power.] weapons were blunted by the energetic support which was\r\ngiven to Lewis the Bavarian, and by the complete alienation of Germany\r\nowing to the residence in Avignon. The first war with Poland ended in\r\nthe victory of the Order. In 1343 Casimir the Great concluded the Treaty\r\nof Kalisch, by which he confirmed the cession of Pomerellen and other\r\ndisputed territories near the valley of the Vistula. In 1346 Denmark\r\nhanded over to the Order its ancient claims on the province of Esthonia.\r\nThe Knights had now acquired almost the whole of the Slav territories to\r\nthe south-east of the Baltic. Only the Lithuanians remained obstinately\r\nheathen and obstinately independent, and against them the Order waged a\r\nfairly successful war during the grand-mastership of Winzig von Kniprode\r\nfrom 1351 to 1382. During these years the Teutonic Order was at the\r\nzenith of its power and prosperity. Brandenburg, which might have\r\ncontested its ascendency in the north, was rendered impotent by the\r\nextinction of the Ascanian line, and by its rapid transfer through the\r\nhands of successive Wittelsbach and Luxemburg margraves. In Poland\r\nCasimir the Great was succeeded in 1370 by his nephew, Lewis of Hungary,\r\nwho had no sympathy with the anti-German prejudices of the Polish\r\nnobles, and was disinclined to employ his forces in the defence of the\r\nheathen peasants of Lithuania. The campaigns of the Order had become a\r\nrecognised school of warfare for the active and ambitious youth of\r\nnorthern Europe. Among the numerous allies who gave their services to\r\nthe cause of Christianity were the adventurous John of Bohemia, who lost\r\nhis eyesight in the marshes of Prussia, and Henry of Derby, son of John\r\nof Gaunt, who later established the Lancastrian dynasty on the English\r\nthrone. Chaucer, in describing the career of his knight, says that\r\n\r\n                  ‘Full ofte tyme he had the bord bygonne\r\n                  Aboven alle naciouns in Pruce,\r\n                  In Lettowe had he reysed and in Ruce.’\r\n\r\nThe death of Kniprode in 1382 was followed by the death of Lewis the\r\nGreat of Hungary and Poland. The party of strong Slav sympathies among\r\nthe Polish nobles were determined to put an end to the union with\r\nHungary and the rule of a foreign king. Lewis’s [Sidenote: Union of\r\nPoland and Lithuania.] younger daughter, Hedwig, was invited to assume\r\nthe crown of Poland, but she was compelled to offer her hand to Jagello,\r\nthe grand prince of Lithuania. Jagello agreed to purchase a bride and a\r\nkingdom by accepting Christianity, and was baptized and crowned by the\r\nname of Ladislas in 1387. The accession of this Lithuanian dynasty,\r\nunder whose rule Poland rose to the height of its power, dealt a fatal\r\nblow to the interests of the Teutonic Order. The two great enemies of\r\nthe Order, whose quarrels with each other had more than once given the\r\nKnights both military and diplomatic triumphs, were henceforth united in\r\na common cause. And the conversion of the Lithuanians, who now adopted\r\nthe faith of their neighbours and allies, struck at the very foundations\r\nof the Order, which rested upon the conception of a crusade against the\r\nheathen. Now that Prussia was surrounded by a ring of Christian states,\r\nthere could no longer be any pretext for a religious war; and foreign\r\nprinces and nobles were not likely to take an active interest in what\r\nbecame from this time a purely political struggle. The stream of\r\nauxiliaries from Europe was dried up at its source, and the Order had to\r\nfall back upon the expensive and unsatisfactory expedient of filling its\r\narmies with mercenary troops.\r\n\r\nFor more than three hundred years Germany had been steadily conquering\r\nthe Slavs, driving them eastwards, or subjecting them to overwhelming\r\nGerman influences. [Sidenote: War with Poland.] Thanks to the Hanseatic\r\nLeague and to the Teutonic Knights, the Baltic had been made into a\r\nGerman sea. But with the fifteenth century a reaction set in in favour\r\nof both Scandinavians and Slavs. Just as the Union of Kalmar involved a\r\nserious danger to the Hanse towns, so the close association of Lithuania\r\nand Poland threatened the vital interests of the Teutonic Knights. In\r\nBohemia the same reaction against German predominance found expression\r\nin the Hussite movement, and in the internal quarrels within the\r\nUniversity of Prague (see p. 209). But it was in Prussia that the Slavs\r\ngained their most durable successes, though the victories of Ziska and\r\nProkop over the crusading armies of Germany made the greater impression\r\nupon Europe at the time. The inevitable struggle which altered\r\nconditions forced upon the Teutonic Order broke out in 1409. In the next\r\nyear the largest armies which had ever met in these northern wars\r\nconfronted each other on the field of Tannenberg. After a [Sidenote:\r\nBattle of Tannenberg.] terrible contest, in which John Ziska, the future\r\nleader of the Hussites, fought for the men of his own race, superior\r\nnumbers gave a decisive victory to the forces of Poland and Lithuania.\r\nThe grand-master and the flower of his Knights fell in the battle, and\r\nPrussia seemed to be at the mercy of the conquerors. But the progress of\r\nKing Ladislas was checked by the heroic resistance of the fortress of\r\nMarienburg; and he consented, in the Peace of Thorn (1411), to give up\r\nall his conquests except one district, which was to be ceded only for\r\nhis own lifetime. The ruin of the Order was postponed for half a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe defeat at Tannenberg might have proved less fatal in its results if\r\nit had not been accompanied by growing internal weakness. An order of\r\nmilitant monks may provide [Sidenote: Decline of the Order.] a\r\nmagnificent fighting force, but it is unlikely to prove a satisfactory\r\nconductor of civil administration. The great evil in Prussia was the\r\nabsence of any substantial common interest between the governors and the\r\ngoverned. At first the German settlers were bound to the Knights as\r\ntheir protectors against the original inhabitants; but as time went on,\r\nand new generations grew up in the country of their birth, the original\r\nenmity between Germans and Slavs gradually cooled, and the two peoples\r\nwere brought closer together in the ordinary intercourse of industry,\r\ntrade, and social life. But this growing union was a source of danger\r\nrather than of gain to the ruling Order, because it deprived them of the\r\naid of that section of the population which might naturally have been\r\nexpected to support the Government. The Knights themselves, being bound\r\nby the priestly vow of celibacy, could not train up successors with a\r\nhereditary knowledge of the people and the country. Each generation of\r\nKnights came from other districts, and had to learn the work of\r\ngovernment afresh. They came for the most part from southern Germany,\r\nand their habits and even their language differed in many respects from\r\nthose of the Low Germans who had come in to settle in their towns and\r\nvillages. And strict as the disciplinary code of the Order was, it was\r\ndifficult to enforce its rules among men who were not secluded from the\r\nworld in monasteries, but were busily engaged in the work of war and\r\nadministration, and were in constant intercourse with visitors from all\r\ncountries. The charges of immorality and unbelief which had been urged\r\nagainst the Templars could certainly be brought with equal if not with\r\ngreater force against the members of the Teutonic Order. The Knights had\r\nnone of the ordinary restraints of family affection, private property,\r\nand home life; and it would have been superhuman if most of them had\r\nbeen able to resist the temptations to which their mode of life and\r\ntheir despotic authority over their subjects exposed them. For there was\r\nnothing like constitutional life in Prussia outside the Order itself.\r\nThe authority of the grand-master was limited by the necessity of\r\ngaining the consent of his chapter and by the great independence of the\r\nprovincial masters. But there was no machinery by which the Knights\r\ncould receive advice and information from the people whom they ruled.\r\nEven the Prussian nobles, whether of German or Slavonic origin, were\r\nexcluded from all voice in the government. After the battle of\r\nTannenberg an attempt was made to establish a representative diet, in\r\norder to enlist popular sympathy in the task of resisting invasion. But\r\nit was the arbitrary act of an individual grand-master, and it broke the\r\nstanding rule which forbade priests to be guided by the counsel of\r\nlaymen. The economic policy of the Order was peculiarly affected by this\r\nwant of easy intercourse with the traders whose interests were at stake.\r\nThe most important towns within its dominions—Danzig, Elbing, Memel,\r\nThorn, Kulm, and Königsberg—were extremely flourishing, and all except\r\nMemel were members of the Hanseatic League. On the whole, a wise\r\ninstinct impelled the Knights to maintain a close alliance with the\r\nLeague, which so ably championed the cause of Germany in the western\r\nBaltic, and thus the danger of conflicting interests between the Order\r\nand the Hanse towns proved less than might have been expected. But the\r\nKnights themselves embarked in trade, especially in amber; and, after\r\nthe fashion of rulers, they sought to regulate the market to bring gain\r\nto themselves, a course of action which excited the jealous hostility of\r\nthe professional merchants. And their imitation of the action of the\r\nLeague proved disastrous. For the maintenance of their great war against\r\nDenmark, the Hanse towns had imposed a duty upon all exports to be\r\nlevied at each port (see p. 434). The Teutonic Order imposed a similar\r\ntax for the Polish war, and endeavoured to make it a permanent source of\r\nrevenue. But the inevitable comparison was not in their favour. The\r\nHanseatic League was fighting in the common interests of all German\r\ntraders, and it was reasonable to ask them to contribute. The Order was\r\nconducting a war in which the merchants as such had no appreciable\r\ninterest at all. The heavy taxation necessitated by the employment of\r\nmercenaries raised the question whether the government of the Order was\r\nworth the expense. Both nobles, citizens, and peasants were gradually\r\nconvinced that their welfare was by no means bound up with crusades in\r\nLithuania and perpetual warfare with Poland. In 1440 a number of nobles\r\nand twenty-one towns combined to form a ‘Prussian League’ for the\r\ndefence of their liberties and common interests. There was no overt\r\ndefiance of the Order, but the League constituted a state within the\r\nstate, and a collision with the older government was sooner or later\r\ninevitable. And when it did occur, it was more than probable that the\r\nforeign enemies of the Order would be able to make use of the League to\r\nserve their own purposes.\r\n\r\nAs the alienation of their subjects became more and more pronounced, the\r\nKnights were driven to maintain their power by measures of\r\never-increasing severity. They denounced their opponents as traitors.\r\nBut they themselves had no better claim to be considered as patriots.\r\nThey were not native Prussians, and they had none of that instinctive\r\ndevotion to the cause of their country which can hardly ever be acquired\r\nexcept under the subtle influences of birth and early training. For this\r\nlove of the soil loyalty to a corporation proved a very inadequate\r\nsubstitute. Henry of Plauen, the hero of the defence of Marienburg in\r\n1410, was rewarded for his services by election to the vacant\r\ngrand-mastership. But a few years later he incurred the displeasure of\r\nthe chapter and was formally deposed. In his chagrin he did not hesitate\r\nto open treacherous negotiations with the Polish king, and ultimately he\r\ndied in the prison to which he was justly condemned. Such an instance\r\nwas by no means isolated; and, in fact, many of the Knights were\r\nsecretly members of the Prussian League. The wonder is, not that the\r\nOrder fell, but that its rule was for a time so successful, and that it\r\nlasted as long as it did.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances that grew up in the fifteenth century, with the\r\nGovernment divided in itself and confronted by the growing hostility of\r\nits subjects, a renewal [Sidenote: Civil war and Polish invasion.] of\r\nthe Polish war could only be attended with disaster. For many years a\r\nquarrel was averted by a series of abject concessions, which were\r\ninterpreted as a sign of weakness, and naturally encouraged further\r\ndemands. At last the final catastrophe was hurried on by the outbreak of\r\ncivil war. The Prussian League had become more and more openly\r\nantagonistic to the rule of the Order, and it was determined to make a\r\nresolute effort to crush the disaffection. In 1453 the Emperor Frederick\r\nIII. was induced to condemn the League, and the Order armed its forces\r\nto carry out the imperial decree. The result might have been foreseen.\r\nThe League renounced all allegiance to the Teutonic Order, and offered\r\nthe suzerainty of Prussia to Casimir of Poland. The offer was accepted.\r\nThe Polish king declared Prussia to be annexed to his dominions, and an\r\narmy was led by Casimir himself to aid the rebels. For twelve years the\r\nunfortunate country was doomed to suffer all the horrors of civil strife\r\nand foreign invasion. In spite of the tremendous odds against them, the\r\nKnights offered a resistance worthy of their military reputation in the\r\npast. In 1457 the grand-master was forced to quit the fortress of\r\nMarienburg, where seventy of his predecessors had held their residence\r\nfor a century and a half. A refuge was found for a time in the eastern\r\ncastle of Königsberg, which was to be the future home of kings of\r\nPrussia in times of similar distress. But the town of Marienburg held\r\nout with heroic obstinacy for another three years, and siege operations\r\nthere and elsewhere delayed the progress of the Poles long after they\r\nhad crushed all resistance in the open field. The grand-master made\r\nfrantic appeals to the Emperor and the German princes for aid against\r\nthe Slavonic conquerors of the great province which the Order had won\r\nfor Germany. To Frederick II. of Brandenburg he sold the Neumark (1455),\r\nwhich had been handed over to the Teutonic Knights by Sigismund in 1402.\r\nBut prayers and bribes were equally unavailing to excite any sentiment\r\nof nationality among princes who had long ceased to regard anything but\r\ntheir own territorial interests. In 1466 it was at last necessary to\r\nsubmit to the consequences of defeat [Sidenote: Treaty of Thorn, 1466.]\r\nand to sign the Treaty of Thorn. The whole of western Prussia, with\r\nPomerellen, including the towns of Danzig, Thorn, Elbing, and Kulm, was\r\nceded to Poland, and the valley of the Vistula passed once more into the\r\nhands of the Slavs. Eastern Prussia, with Königsberg as its capital, was\r\nleft in the hands of the Order, but it was to be held as a Polish fief.\r\nAll allegiance to any other secular prince was to be repudiated, and\r\nthus the connection with Germany was formally ended. Future\r\ngrand-masters were to do homage on election to the king of Poland, and\r\nwere to sit on his left hand in the Polish Diet.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to dwell at any length on the subsequent fate of the\r\nTeutonic Order, which had fallen so lamentably [Sidenote: End of the\r\nTeutonic Order.] from its high estate. The Knights of the Sword\r\nrepudiated their subordination to a grand-master who was no longer a\r\nsovereign prince, and assumed the independent rule of Livonia and\r\nEsthonia. The House of Jagellon went from one triumph to another; and\r\nits ascendency in eastern Europe seemed to be established when Ladislas,\r\na younger son of Casimir IV., was elected to the crown of Bohemia in\r\n1471, and to that of Hungary in 1490. Resistance to so great a power as\r\nPoland had now become must have seemed chimerical, yet the Knights\r\ncontinued to cherish the idea of recovering their lost independence.\r\nWith this object in view they resisted all proposals to unite the\r\ngrand-mastership with the Polish monarchy, and adopted the policy of\r\nelecting successive chiefs from the great families of northern Germany,\r\nin the hope of enlisting their support for the cause of Prussia. Thus in\r\n1498 they chose Frederick of Saxony, and in 1511 Albert of Hohenzollern.\r\nThe latter was for a time encouraged by the promise of assistance held\r\nout by Maximilian I. But the Hapsburgs ever preferred the interests of\r\ntheir house to those of Germany; and the hopes of Albert were dashed to\r\nthe ground when he learned that Maximilian had, in 1516, concluded a\r\ntreaty and a double marriage alliance with the Jagellon princes in order\r\nto secure to his grandson Ferdinand the succession in Hungary and\r\nBohemia. In anger and despair Albert determined to repudiate his\r\nallegiance both to Church and Empire. In 1525 he adopted the Protestant\r\nfaith, confirmed the cession of West Prussia to Poland, and received\r\nEast Prussia as a hereditary duchy for himself and his heirs. Although\r\nan obstinate minority of the Knights refused to acknowledge the validity\r\nof the grand-master’s action, the Teutonic Order was practically\r\ndissolved. The remnant of the state which it had built up with such\r\nstrenuous exertions fell a century later to the main line of the\r\nelectors of Brandenburg, and gave a title to the monarchy which has\r\nbecome in later times the paramount power in a united Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Order of the Sword lingered a few years longer, only to meet with a\r\nsimilar fate in the end. In 1561 the last grand-master, Gotthard\r\nKetteler, finding it impossible [Sidenote: End of the Order of the\r\nSword.] to maintain independence, imitated the action of Albert of\r\nHohenzollern. He carved out for himself the secular duchy of Courland,\r\nto be held in vassalage to Poland, while the rest of Livonia and\r\nEsthonia was thrown as an apple of discord into the midst of the rival\r\nBaltic states—Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Russia. The struggle which\r\nfollowed is noteworthy, not only because it led to the temporary\r\nascendency of Sweden in the Baltic, and so to the achievements of its\r\nwarrior-kings, Gustavus Adolphus, Charles X., and Charles XII., but also\r\nbecause it gave occasion for the first appearance of Russia as a\r\nEuropean power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n                     THE CHRISTIAN STATES OF SPAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n    Suspension of the Moorish wars in the middle of the thirteenth\r\n    century—Constitution of Castile—Disorders in the kingdom—Alfonso\r\n    XI.’s victories over the Moors—Peter the Cruel and Henry of\r\n    Trastamara—John of Gaunt in Spain—John II. of Castile and Alvaro de\r\n    Luna—Henry III. and the accession of Isabella in Castile—The\r\n    Constitution of Aragon—Acquisition of Sicily and Sardinia—The\r\n    general Privilege and the Privilege of Union—Reign of Peter\r\n    IV.—Re-union of Sicily with Aragon—Accession of the House of\r\n    Trastamara in Aragon—Alfonso V. gains Naples—Relations of Aragon and\r\n    Navarre—John II. and Charles of Viana—Union of Castile and\r\n    Aragon—Government of Ferdinand and Isabella—The _Santa Hermandad_\r\n    and the Inquisition—Conquest of Granada—Geographical discoveries of\r\n    Portugal and Castile—The Bull of Borgia and the Treaty of\r\n    Tordesillas.\r\n\r\nThe middle of the thirteenth century was an important turning-point in\r\nthe history of Spain. Hitherto the Christian [Sidenote: Suspension of\r\nMoorish wars.] states had been engaged in a continuous crusade for the\r\nconquest or expulsion of the Moors, who had held almost the whole\r\npeninsula in the eighth century. But the capture of Cordova in 1236, and\r\nof Seville in 1248, with the reduction of the province of Murcia in\r\n1266, drove the Moors to their last stronghold in the kingdom of\r\nGranada, which they were allowed to retain in comparative peace for\r\nnearly two centuries and a half. This cessation of military activity in\r\nthe south was due to several causes. Granada itself was strongly\r\ndefended by nature, and its population was more homogeneous than that of\r\nthe dominions which had been lost. And the old enemies of the Moors were\r\nnow diminished in number. Portugal was cut off from all direct contact\r\nwith the infidel by the district round Seville and Cadiz, and Aragon was\r\nequally isolated by the intervention of the Castilian province of\r\nMurcia. The only state which had a conterminous frontier with the Moors\r\nwas Castile, and the attention of Castile was distracted from its\r\nsouthern neighbours by internal feuds and foreign interests. One result\r\nof the termination of the religious war is that Spanish history loses\r\nsuch unity as it had hitherto possessed, and it is henceforth necessary\r\nto follow the separate history of its component states. And with its\r\nunity the history of the peninsula loses much of its dignity and\r\nimportance. The record of internal feuds, of dynastic revolutions, and\r\nof criminal bloodshed, which fills the annals of the Spanish kingdoms,\r\nand especially of Castile, would hardly be worth preserving if it were\r\nnot the necessary prelude to the rise of Spain in the sixteenth century\r\nto a foremost position among the powers of Europe.\r\n\r\nCastile, permanently united with Leon since 1230, was the largest, and\r\nultimately the dominant state of Spain. It had been formed in the course\r\nof a prolonged religious [Sidenote: Constitution of Castile.] war, and\r\nthis had left a permanent impress on the constitution. While the kings\r\nhad risen to power as military leaders, the nobles and cities had also\r\nearned great independence in a struggle which had often depended more\r\nupon sudden local effort than upon the action of large armies; and the\r\nclergy, as the preachers of religious ardour against the infidel,\r\nretained more authority than in any other country in Europe. When\r\nnational exertion was relaxed by the diminution of external danger, a\r\nstruggle between the rival forces was inevitable; and though the victory\r\nrested in the end with the monarchy, it was long before this result was\r\nassured. The national assembly, or Cortes, was composed of three\r\nestates—clergy, nobles, and citizens—and its importance varied very much\r\nfrom time to time. But the royal power was more effectually limited by\r\nthe danger of armed resistance than by any formal constitutional\r\nrestrictions. The great nobles were independent princes in their own\r\ndomains, and could command the allegiance of their vassals in private\r\nfeuds with each other, and even in warfare against the crown. For the\r\nvindication of their own rights, and for resisting the encroachments of\r\nthe barons, the towns claimed and exercised the right of forming an\r\narmed union or _hermandad_. It was fortunate for the kings that\r\nconflicting interests and mutual jealousy prevented any common action\r\nbetween classes whose power both of offence and defence was so extremely\r\nformidable.\r\n\r\nAlfonso X., who ruled in Castile from 1252 to 1284, is known in history\r\nas ‘The Wise,’ but the epithet was earned [Sidenote: Disorders in\r\nCastile.] by his remarkable learning rather than by his ability as a\r\nruler. The only territorial acquisition of his reign, Murcia, was won\r\nfor him by the arms of Aragon. He abandoned the war against the Moors\r\nfor a vain effort to gain the imperial dignity, which he disputed during\r\nthe Great Interregnum with an English rival, Richard of Cornwall. His\r\nlater years, and the reigns of his successors, Sancho IV. (1284-1295)\r\nand Ferdinand IV. (1295-1312), were disturbed by a disputed succession\r\nto the crown. Alfonso’s eldest son, Ferdinand de Cerda, died in 1275,\r\nleaving two sons, who are known as the Infantes de Cerda. According to\r\nmodern ideas, their hereditary claim would be incontestable. But in the\r\nMiddle Ages it was frequently held that nearness of blood gave a better\r\nclaim than descent in an elder line. On this ground Alfonso’s second\r\nson, Sancho, was recognised as his father’s heir, and succeeded in\r\nousting his nephews. But the Infantes de Cerda had many partisans in\r\nCastile, and a prolonged but desultory struggle ensued, in which the\r\nneighbouring kings of Aragon and Portugal were involved. The actual\r\ncontest was ended by a treaty in 1305, by which the claimants were\r\nbought off with lavish grants of land. But the disorders to which it had\r\ngiven rise were not so easily suppressed. Two successive kings,\r\nFerdinand IV. and Alfonso XI. (1312-1350), came to the throne in their\r\nchildhood, and a minority is always an evil in an early stage of\r\nsociety. Castile in this matter was almost as unlucky as was Scotland a\r\nlittle later, and the results in the two countries were very similar.\r\nThe noble families fought out private wars among themselves, and the\r\nkings became rather partisans than arbiters among their subjects. In\r\nfact, the chief force for the maintenance of order was supplied, not by\r\nthe monarchy, but by a great _hermandad_ or brotherhood, which was\r\nformed in 1295 by thirty-four Castilian towns.\r\n\r\nThe obvious weakness of Castile, after nearly seventy years of anarchy,\r\nencouraged the Moors to make an effort for the recovery of their lost\r\npower. Abul Hakam, the [Sidenote: War of Alfonso XI. with the Moors.]\r\nEmir of Fez, crossed the Straits of Gibraltar in 1339 with a large army.\r\nHe was joined by the ruler of Granada, and their combined forces laid\r\nsiege to Tarifa. The approach of danger had a wholesome and healing\r\neffect upon Castile. Alfonso XI. was enabled to make peace with his\r\nrebellious subjects, and also with the king of Portugal, whose daughter\r\nhe had married only to desert her for the beautiful Eleanor de Guzman.\r\nIn 1340 he advanced to the relief of Tarifa, and gained in the battle of\r\nthe Salado the first victory which had fallen to a Castilian king for\r\nnearly a century. The complaisant chronicler of the royal achievement\r\ntells us that only twenty Christians perished in a battle which cost the\r\nlives of two hundred thousand Moslems. It is at any rate authentic that\r\nAbul Hakam was driven back to Africa, and that in 1344 Alfonso captured\r\nthe town of Algeciras. He hoped to complete his success by the reduction\r\nof Gibraltar, which would have excluded any further reinforcement from\r\nAfrica to the Moors of Granada. But he was carried off by the Black\r\nDeath in 1350, and this event led to the abandonment of the siege.\r\nAlfonso’s successes against the infidel have outweighed in the histories\r\nof Spain both the vices of his private character and the disorder that\r\nprevailed in the kingdom during his minority and the greater part of his\r\nreign.\r\n\r\nFew historical epithets have been more thoroughly deserved [Sidenote:\r\nPeter the Cruel.] than that of ‘the Cruel,’ as attached to the name of\r\nPeter I. (1350-1369). Numerous attempts to whitewash his character have\r\nbeen made in vain, and all that can be said in his favour is that he had\r\nreceived very great provocation. He was the only son of Alfonso XI. and\r\nMaria of Portugal, and during his father’s reign both he and his mother\r\nhad been kept in ignominious seclusion, while every mark of favour was\r\nshowered upon the royal mistress, Eleanor de Guzman, and her numerous\r\nchildren. Henry, the eldest of the bastards, was Count of Trastamara,\r\nand his twin-brother Frederick held the grand-mastership of the great\r\nOrder of St. James. It was by no means unnatural that the dowager queen\r\nshould urge her son, when he came into power, to avenge the insults\r\nwhich she had so long endured in angry impotence. Eleanor de Guzman was\r\nstrangled in 1351, and two of her sons in later years were murdered by\r\nthe king’s own hand. Henry of Trastamara sought safety in exile, first\r\nin Portugal, and afterwards in France. It would be disgusting even to\r\nenumerate the atrocious acts which have been attributed, some with more\r\nand some with less authority, to the youthful monster in his early\r\nyears. His treatment of Blanche of Bourbon, whose hand he had solicited\r\nfrom the French king, is a conspicuous but rather mild illustration of\r\nhis ruthless temperament. He was living openly with a mistress, Maria de\r\nPadilla, when the princess arrived, and he refused even to see her.\r\nLater, under considerable pressure, he went through the form of\r\nmarriage, but immediately returned to the arms of his mistress; and the\r\nbride, who was never a wife, was consigned to a solitary prison, and\r\nultimately poisoned. In 1356 Peter put down a rebellion among his\r\nnobles, and took the most sanguinary vengeance upon his defeated\r\nopponents. His thirst for bloodshed seems, in moments of excitement, to\r\nhave amounted almost to mania. Yet, for a long time at any rate, he was\r\nnot unpopular with the lower orders among his subjects. It was upon the\r\nnobles and the Jews, neither very popular with the people, that his hand\r\nfell with such severity, and he could show at times a coarse good-nature\r\nand a taste for rough buffoonery which won him some popular applause.\r\nThis helps to explain why he met with little or no opposition when he\r\nendeavoured to secure the succession to his own illegitimate children.\r\nIn 1362 he solemnly swore to the Cortes, and his oath was supported by\r\nthe archbishop of Toledo, that he had been for ten years the lawful\r\nhusband of Maria de Padilla, and the docile Cortes recognised her\r\nchildren as legitimate heirs to the crown. But this settlement was not\r\ndestined to be carried out. Bastardy in Spain, as in Italy, was not\r\nconsidered so fatal a bar to inheritance as it was regarded in northern\r\ncountries. Henry of Trastamara found supporters in Peter of Aragon and\r\nCharles V. of France, who had both grounds of quarrel with the king of\r\nCastile. The latter, who was preparing to repudiate the treaty of\r\nBretigni and to renew the war with the English, was not unwilling to\r\nallow Bertrand du Guesclin to train on Spanish soil the military\r\ncompanies which he was forming for the service of France. In 1365 a\r\nlarge army crossed the Pyrenees into Aragon, and thence proceeded in the\r\nnext year to establish Henry of Trastamara upon the Castilian throne.\r\nPeter fled to Bordeaux to implore the aid of the Black Prince, and\r\nunfortunately succeeded in touching a chivalrous chord in his host’s\r\ncharacter. At the battle of Najara the war-hardened troops, which had\r\nwon the victory of Poitiers, proved more than a match for the only\r\nhalf-trained recruits of du Guesclin (1367). Peter recovered his\r\nkingdom, but he showed as much ingratitude to his auxiliaries as he\r\nshowed barbarity towards his own subjects. Neither the Black Prince nor\r\nhis army ever completely recovered from their successful but disastrous\r\ncampaign in Spain, and Charles V. was able in a few years from 1369 to\r\nexpel the English from nearly the whole of their possessions in France\r\n(see p. 95). But the betrayer had no better fortune than the betrayed.\r\nThe departure of Peter’s allies enabled Henry of Trastamara to return to\r\nCastile, and with French aid to win the battle of Montiel. In a personal\r\ninterview the two half-brothers came to blows, and Henry’s dagger\r\navenged the death of his murdered kinsfolk. The two surviving children\r\nof Peter and Maria Padilla, Constance and Isabella, had been left at\r\nBordeaux, and were married to two brothers of the Black Prince—John of\r\nGaunt, duke of Lancaster, and Edmund Langley, duke of York.\r\n\r\nHenry II. had by no means reached the end of his troubles when the death\r\nof Peter enabled him for the [Sidenote: Henry II., 1369-79.] second time\r\nto ascend the throne of Castile. His title was contested by two rival\r\ncandidates—Ferdinand of Portugal, whose grandmother had been a daughter\r\nof Sancho IV., and John of Gaunt, who asserted the legitimacy and rights\r\nof his wife as recognised by the Cortes of 1362.[12] The Portuguese king\r\nwas the nearer and, for the moment, the more formidable opponent, but\r\nFrench aid enabled Henry to attack Lisbon and extort a treaty of peace.\r\nThe illness of the Black Prince left the conduct of the war in France to\r\nJohn of Gaunt, and so Henry was able at once to harass his rival and to\r\nrepay some of his obligations to Charles V. by sending a Castilian fleet\r\nto cut off direct communication between England and Gascony. Thus the\r\nreign, which had opened so stormily, ended in complete peace, and Henry\r\nof Trastamara handed on the crown to his son [Sidenote: John I.\r\n1379-90.] John I. (1379). His accession gave the signal for a renewal of\r\nthe war with Portugal and of the Lancastrian claim. In 1385 the\r\nPortuguese troops won a crushing victory at Aljubarrota, and in the next\r\nyear John of Gaunt came to the Peninsula in person to uphold his wife’s\r\ncause. His daughter Philippa was married to the new king of Portugal,\r\nJohn I., and their united forces invaded Castile and occupied\r\nCompostella. But the Castilians had no desire to accept a foreign\r\ndynasty; and John of Gaunt, never very lucky or very resolute in his\r\nenterprises, was induced to desert his son-in-law and to conclude a\r\nseparate peace (1387). Catharine, the only daughter of John of Gaunt and\r\nConstance, was betrothed to John of Castile’s eldest son Henry, the\r\nfirst heir to the crown who received the title of Prince of Asturias,\r\nand the mother’s claim was renounced in favour of the youthful bride.\r\n\r\nHenry III., though he was only a boy when his father was suddenly killed\r\nby a fall from his horse, proved to be one of [Sidenote: Henry III.,\r\n1390-1406.] the ablest kings in the history of Castile. He insisted on a\r\nresumption of domain-lands which had fallen into the hands of the\r\nnobles, and maintained greater order in the kingdom than had been known\r\nfor many generations. His marriage with Catharine of Lancaster freed him\r\nfrom any rival claimants to the throne, and also contributed to the\r\nmaintenance of peace with Portugal, whose queen was Catharine’s\r\nhalf-sister. But, unfortunately, his health was never strong, and he\r\ndied in 1406 at the early age of twenty-seven, leaving a boy of two\r\nyears old to succeed him. As it happened, the minority [Sidenote: John\r\nII., 1406-1454.] of John II. proved to be the most successful and\r\norderly part of his reign. The regency was shared between his mother and\r\nhis uncle Ferdinand; and so great was the respect inspired by the\r\nlatter, that he might easily have supplanted his nephew with the general\r\napproval of the Castilians. But Ferdinand acted with perfect loyalty;\r\nand after his elevation to the throne of Aragon in 1412, he continued to\r\ngive honest and disinterested advice to his sister-in-law.\r\nUnfortunately, when John II. was old enough to take the government into\r\nhis own hands, he proved wholly unworthy of the care with which his\r\nkingdom had been administered for him. Unwarlike and averse to the cares\r\nof business, he allowed himself to be completely overshadowed by the\r\nfamous Alvaro de Luna, grand-master of the [Sidenote: Alvaro de Luna.]\r\nOrder of St. James, and constable of Castile. Alvaro de Luna was no\r\ncommonplace favourite. He was by general recognition the most\r\naccomplished knight of his country and his age, and he combined with his\r\nbrilliant personal attractions political abilities of no mean order. He\r\nset himself to increase the authority of the crown because that\r\nauthority was wielded by himself, and he achieved no small measure of\r\nsuccess. He trampled upon the privileges of his brother nobles, and he\r\nprepared the way for the humiliation of the third estate by reducing the\r\nrepresentation in the Cortes to seventeen of the principal cities. But\r\nhis government, although despotic, was by no means conducive to order.\r\nThe absolutism of a king may be submitted to and even welcomed, but the\r\nabsolutism of a subject is certain to excite discontent among those who\r\nconsider themselves to be legally his equals. The reign of John II. was\r\nfilled by a series of conspiracies and rebellions, and the malcontents\r\nin Castile received formidable assistance from the king’s cousin, John\r\nof Aragon. The constable, however, was as successful in the battle-field\r\nas in the tilt-yard, and no Castilian rebel or foreign foe was strong\r\nenough to effect his overthrow. His ultimate downfall was due to the\r\ningratitude of his master. John’s second wife, Isabella of Portugal,\r\nindignant that her authority counted for so little in the state, set\r\nherself to sow distrust between her husband and the all-powerful\r\nminister. The more domestic influence triumphed for the moment over the\r\nfeeble mind of the king, and Alvaro de Luna was put to death after a\r\nparody of a trial in 1453.\r\n\r\nJohn II. only survived the constable a year, and his death in 1454\r\nushered in a still more troubled period for Castile. He left behind him\r\nthree children—Henry, the son of his first wife, Mary of Aragon, and\r\nIsabella and Alfonso, the offspring of Isabella of Portugal. Henry IV.,\r\n[Sidenote: Henry IV., 1454-74.] who succeeded his father, was the most\r\nincapable king of Castile until the accession of the unfortunate Charles\r\nII. in the seventeenth century. He was equally feeble in mind and body,\r\nand the contempt of his subjects found expression in his appellation of\r\n‘Henry the Impotent.’ There were several aspirants to fill the position\r\nwhich Alvaro de Luna had held in the previous reign, and success rested\r\nwith Beltran de la Cueva, who had all the showy without any of the solid\r\nqualities of the famous constable. It was currently reported that the\r\nhandsome favourite supplemented his influence over the king by securing\r\nthe affections of the queen, Joanna of Portugal. The birth of a daughter\r\nincreased instead of allaying the scandal, and the unfortunate infanta\r\nwas generally known as ‘la Beltraneja.’ Jealousy of the favourite and\r\ndisgust with the king’s incompetence combined to provoke a formidable\r\nrebellion (1465). At Avila the rebels went through the formal ceremony\r\nof deposing a puppet dressed up to represent the king. The crown was\r\noffered to Henry’s half-brother Alfonso, on the ground that Joanna was\r\nillegitimate, but the young prince died in 1468, before the civil war\r\nhad come to a decisive end. Isabella, to whom the malcontents now\r\nturned, showed that she had inherited the qualities of her mother rather\r\nthan those of her father. With a calculating wisdom beyond her years,\r\nshe [Sidenote: Isabella.] refused to weaken her claim by allowing her\r\ncause to be associated with rebellion against the monarchy. At the same\r\ntime she was equally resolute to avoid any recognition of the legitimacy\r\nof her niece. Her firmness extorted a treaty from Henry IV., by which\r\nshe was recognised as his heiress, and on this condition the rebels were\r\ninduced to lay down their arms (1468). In the next year Isabella\r\nconcluded her all-important marriage with Ferdinand, the heir to the\r\ncrown of Aragon. As soon as the immediate danger of deposition was\r\nremoved, Henry IV. embarked in a struggle to repudiate the recent treaty\r\nand to secure the succession to his wife’s daughter. But he died in 1474\r\nwithout having succeeded in his aim, and his half-sister inherited the\r\ncrown. The cause of Joanna was now espoused by her uncle, Alfonso V. of\r\nPortugal, but Isabella succeeded in maintaining the position she had\r\nwon. Her accession, and the subsequent union of the crowns of Aragon and\r\nCastile, ushered in a new and more distinguished epoch in the history of\r\nthe Spanish peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Aragon was formed by the union of the three provinces of\r\nAragon, Catalonia, and Valencia. The union was very imperfect, as each\r\nprovince jealously [Sidenote: Constitution of Aragon.] insisted upon\r\nretaining its own laws and institutions, and resented any attempt to\r\nintroduce uniformity of administration. The powers of the monarchy were\r\nmore narrowly restricted than in the neighbouring kingdom of Castile.\r\nThe privileges of the _ricos hombres_, or great nobles, were so\r\nextensive as to make them almost the equals of their king, and the\r\ndesire to maintain these privileges brought about among them a wholly\r\nunusual unity of interest and political action. Ferdinand the Catholic\r\nexpressed this difference between the two kingdoms in his saying that\r\n‘it was as difficult to divide the nobles of Aragon as to unite the\r\nnobles of Castile.’ And the citizens were not far behind the nobles in\r\nthe spirit of independence, which was especially strong in the maritime\r\nprovince of Catalonia. The representation of towns in the Cortes of\r\nAragon dates back to 1133, thirty-three years before any similar\r\nconcession was made in Castile, and more than a century before any\r\nregular practice of central representation was established in England.\r\nThe Cortes was not a general assembly of the whole kingdom, but each\r\nprovince had its own Cortes, which possessed within its borders the\r\nsupreme control of jurisdiction, legislation, and taxation. In Valencia\r\nand Aragon the assembly consisted, as in Castile and France, of the\r\nordinary three estates—clergy, nobles, and citizens. But the Cortes of\r\nAragon contained four estates or arms (_brazos_). Besides the clergy and\r\nthe delegates of towns, the secular nobles were divided into two\r\ndistinct classes—(1) the _ricos hombres_, who had the right of attending\r\neither in person or by proxy, and (2) the _infanzones_, or lesser\r\ntenants-in-chief, and the _caballeros_, the sub-tenants, who were\r\nentitled to attend in virtue of their knighthood. In the office of\r\nJusticiar, Aragon possessed a unique institution which has always\r\nattracted the interest of historical students. Originally the Justiciar\r\nwas merely the president of the Cortes when it sat as a court of\r\njustice, and his functions were of no special political importance. But\r\nin course of time he became the mediator, and ultimately the supreme\r\narbiter, in all disputes between the monarch and his subjects. In this\r\ncapacity he was regarded as at once the depositary and the champion of\r\nconstitutional traditions and liberties. The dignity of the office was\r\nenhanced by the character of its successive holders, and the history of\r\nAragon abounds with instances of their resolute resistance to despotism\r\non the one hand or to lawless disorder on the other. It is noteworthy\r\nthat the responsibility of the Justiciar to the Cortes was secured by\r\nhis selection from the lesser nobles or knights. The _ricos hombres_,\r\nwhose privileges included exemption from execution or any corporal\r\npunishment, were always excluded from the office.\r\n\r\nJames I. of Aragon (1213-1276) is known by the honourable title of the\r\nConqueror. He brought the long Moorish wars to an end, and completed the\r\nextension of the kingdom by the annexation of the Balearic Islands,\r\nwhich had long been a nest of Mussulman pirates, and of Valencia. He\r\nalso effected the reduction of Murcia, but with rare loyalty handed it\r\nover to the king of Castile, in whose name he had carried on the war\r\n(1266). One result of these victories was that his successors, freed\r\nfrom the pressure of continual warfare at home, were able to turn their\r\nattention eastwards to events in Italy. Peter III. (1276-1285) was\r\nmarried to Constance, the daughter and heiress [Sidenote: Aragon and\r\nSicily.] of Manfred, and thus acquired a claim to be regarded as the\r\nsuccessor of the Hohenstaufen in Naples and Sicily. But it is doubtful\r\nwhether this claim would have led to any practical results but for the\r\nmassacre of the French in the famous Sicilian Vespers (1282). To protect\r\nthemselves from the vengeance of Charles of Anjou, the islanders\r\nappealed to the king of Aragon, and offered him the crown. Hence arose\r\nthe prolonged wars against a coalition formed by the Angevin rulers of\r\nNaples, the popes and the kings of France, which constitute the most\r\nprominent episode, not only in the later years of Peter III., but also\r\nin the reigns of his two sons and successors, Alfonso III. (1285-1291)\r\nand James II. (1291-1327). These wars have already been referred to in\r\nconnection with the history both of France and of Italy (see pp. 25,\r\n48), and it is unnecessary to tell the story again. The essential points\r\nto remember are that in 1295 Boniface VIII. negotiated a treaty by which\r\nJames II. was to marry Blanche, the daughter of Charles II. of Naples,\r\nto receive the island of Sardinia, and resign his claim upon Sicily; but\r\nthe Sicilians refused to agree to terms in which they had had no voice,\r\noffered the crown to James’s younger brother Frederick, and succeeded in\r\n1302 in establishing him upon the throne. Hence in the end there was a\r\ndouble gain. Sicily was secured to a younger branch of the house of\r\nAragon, and on its extinction reverted to the main line. Some years\r\nlater James III. (1327-1336) took Sardinia from the Genoese and Pisans\r\nin virtue of a treaty which had been very imperfectly carried out on his\r\nside, as the only price which he paid for his acquisition had been an\r\nineffectual attempt to expel his brother from a kingdom which he had\r\ndeemed himself too weak to retain. Sardinia remained united with Aragon,\r\nand so with Spain, until the treaty of Rastadt in 1714 gave it to\r\nAustria, and the treaty of London in 1720 transferred it, with the title\r\nof king, to the duke of Savoy.\r\n\r\nThese Italian wars were not without their influence on the history of\r\nAragon. They were waged in the interest of the dynasty, not of the\r\nkingdom, and the Aragonese [Sidenote: Concessions to the Aragonese.] had\r\na substantial grievance in being called upon to furnish money, men, and\r\nships for an enterprise in which they had no particular concern. Hence\r\nthe kings were compelled to appease their subjects by concessions, which\r\nwent far beyond any sacrifices extorted from contemporary rulers in\r\nother countries. The ‘General Privilege,’ granted by Peter III. in 1283,\r\nhas been compared, and justly compared, with the English _Magna Charta_.\r\nIt provided salutary securities for general and individual liberty, and\r\nits frequent confirmation shows that it was highly valued. But four\r\nyears later Alfonso III. went to a dangerous extreme when he signed the\r\nfamous ‘Privilege of Union’ (1287). By this his subjects were formally\r\nauthorised to take up arms against their sovereign if he attempted to\r\ninfringe their privileges. Rebellion may be and often is the only\r\neffectual safeguard against oppression, but it is harmful and\r\nunnecessary to formulate a right to rebel. The Privilege of Union put a\r\nvery formidable weapon into the hands of the nobles, who could always\r\ndisguise the selfish pursuit of their own interests under the pretence\r\nthat they were engaged in opposing despotism.\r\n\r\nPeter IV. of Aragon (1336-1387) was the first king who set himself to\r\nfree the monarchy from some of the excessive [Sidenote: Reign of Peter\r\nIV.] restraints which had been imposed upon it. He annexed to the crown\r\nthe Balearic Islands, which had been held since 1374 by a younger son of\r\nJames the Conqueror and his descendants, under the title of kings of\r\nMajorca. The reigning king, James II., made a prolonged struggle to\r\nretain a dominion which he had done nothing to forfeit, but was\r\ncompelled to submit to the superior force of his imperious cousin. This\r\narbitrary act was followed by an attempt to settle the succession\r\naccording to the personal wishes of the king. At the time (1347) Peter\r\nhad only one child, a daughter Constance, and the heir-presumptive to\r\nthe throne was his half-brother James, Count of Urgel. There was no law\r\nor custom excluding females from the succession in Aragon, but there was\r\na very strong prejudice in favour of male heirs, and they had usually\r\nbeen preferred to heiresses, even though the latter stood nearer in the\r\nline of descent. The attempt of James to procure a settlement in favour\r\nof his daughter, combined with the generally high-handed character of\r\nhis government, provoked a formidable rising among the nobles, and also\r\ngave them a powerful leader in James of Urgel. Claiming the rights\r\naccorded by the Privilege of 1287, the rebels formed a Union at\r\nSaragossa and formulated their demands. The king, taken by surprise, was\r\ncompelled at first to feign compliance; but the opportune death of James\r\nof Urgel, attributed by contemporaries to poison administered by his\r\nbrother’s command, together with a rally of the Catalans to the cause of\r\nthe king, turned the balance in favour of Peter IV. In 1348 the royal\r\nforces met the rebels on the field of Epila, and gained a complete\r\nvictory. The Privilege of Union was promptly revoked, and the parchment\r\non which it was written was destroyed by the king’s own hands. Thus the\r\nmonarchy gained a really considerable triumph, and the nobles were the\r\nonly immediate sufferers. In fact, Peter made no attempt to curtail any\r\npopular liberties, and the authority of the Justiciar was more firmly\r\nestablished in his reign by the grant of a life-tenure to the holders of\r\nthe office. His later years were occupied with wars against his cruel\r\nnamesake in Castile, with a struggle against the Genoese in Sardinia,\r\nand with the suppression of an attempt on the part of James III. to\r\nrecover his father’s kingdom of Majorca. The original doubt about the\r\nsuccession was removed by the birth of two sons, who successively came\r\nto the throne as John I. (1387-1395) and Martin I. (1395-1410). Their\r\nreigns are chiefly noteworthy for the reunion of Sicily with Aragon. The\r\ntwo crowns had [Sidenote: Reversion of Sicily.] been separated since the\r\nrepudiation of his claims by James II. had given his younger brother\r\nFrederick the opportunity of gaining a kingdom. Since 1302 Sicily had\r\nbeen peacefully held by the descendants of Frederick I.; and on the\r\nextinction of the male line had fallen to an heiress, Mary, the daughter\r\nof Frederick II. by a marriage with a daughter of Peter IV. of Aragon.\r\nMary was married in 1391 to her cousin, Martin the Younger, the only son\r\nof Martin I., who was enabled by the support of his uncle and father to\r\nobtain the Sicilian crown. On his early death in 1409, the island\r\nkingdom fell to his father, who for the one remaining year of his life\r\nwas king both of Aragon and of Sicily.\r\n\r\nThe death of Martin the Younger not only brought the crown of Sicily to\r\nthe king of Aragon, but also gave rise to a disputed succession in the\r\nlatter kingdom. The [Sidenote: Disputed succession.] elder Martin was\r\nnow the only surviving male descendant of Peter IV., and he died in\r\n1410, before any arrangement had been come to about his successor. If\r\nmale descent were insisted upon, the obvious heir was James of Urgel,\r\nwhose grandfather had been the second son of Alfonso IV. Recent\r\nprecedents, notably the accession of Martin himself in preference to the\r\ndaughters of John I., were in favour of the exclusion of heiresses, but\r\nthere remained the open question whether the male descendants of a woman\r\ncould derive a claim through her. Of such candidates, two were most\r\nprominent—Louis, the eldest son of Louis II. of Anjou and John I.’s\r\ndaughter Yolande, and Ferdinand, the regent of Castile in the minority\r\nof John II., whose mother was Eleanor, a daughter of Peter IV.[13] There\r\ncan be no doubt that the count of Urgel had by far the strongest\r\nhereditary claim; but his own rash assumption that he had only to take\r\nthe crown provoked opposition among the rather contentious Aragonese,\r\nand he was ultimately excluded. A joint committee was appointed from the\r\nCortes of the three provinces to inquire into precedents; and after an\r\ninterregnum of two years, their choice curiously fell upon Ferdinand of\r\nCastile, whose claim by descent was unquestionably weaker than that of\r\nhis rivals (1412).\r\n\r\nThus the lucky house of Trastamara, in spite of its illegitimate origin,\r\nhad come to furnish a king in Aragon as well as in Castile. And within a\r\ngeneration events enabled the family to add to these possessions the\r\nkingdom of Naples, and for a time the kingdom of Navarre. Ferdinand I.\r\ndid not live long enough to display in Aragon the great qualities which\r\nhis administration in Castile had shown him to possess. His elder son\r\nAlfonso V. (1416-1458) [Sidenote: Alfonso V. and Naples.] is more\r\nassociated with the history of Italy than with that of Spain. He\r\ninherited from his father Sicily and Sardinia as well as Aragon, and in\r\n1423 his adoption by Joanna II. opened to him the prospect of inheriting\r\nNaples. But the vicious queen soon changed her mind, disinherited\r\nAlfonso, and adopted in his place Louis III. of Anjou, who could claim\r\nthrough his mother a better right to the crown of Aragon than Alfonso\r\nhimself. This double adoption led to the long war between the house of\r\nAragon and the second house of Anjou, which raged for the last twelve\r\nyears of Joanna’s reign, and for eight years after her death. It ended\r\nin the victory of Alfonso, who reigned peacefully in Naples until his\r\ndeath in 1458 (see p. 271). As he left no legitimate children, Aragon,\r\nSicily, and Sardinia passed to his brother John II. (1458-1494), but\r\nNaples was transferred to his bastard son Ferrante I. Half a century was\r\nto elapse before the kingdom of the Two Sicilies was re-formed by\r\nFerdinand the Catholic.\r\n\r\nWhile Alfonso was engaged in winning the crown of Naples amidst the\r\nturmoil of an Italian war, his younger brother John had succeeded in\r\nestablishing an intimate [Sidenote: Relations of Aragon and Navarre.]\r\nrelation with Navarre. This little kingdom, which comprised territory on\r\nboth sides of the Pyrenees, had for a long time been more closely\r\nconnected with France than with Spain.[14] United with the French crown\r\nby the marriage of Blanche of Navarre with Philip IV., it had again\r\nbecome independent on the extinction of the direct line of the house of\r\nCapet. When Philip of Valois ascended the throne of France, Navarre\r\npassed to the rightful heiress, Jeanne, the daughter of Louis X., and\r\nshe was crowned with her husband, Philip of Evreux, in 1329. Their son,\r\nCharles the Bad (1349-1387), played a prominent, though not very\r\ncreditable part in French history during the wars with Edward III. (see\r\nChapter IV.). Charles II. (1387-1425), who succeeded his father, devoted\r\nmore attention to art and letters than to politics, and kept his kingdom\r\nin peace and obscurity. His daughter and heiress, Blanche, married John\r\nof Aragon, but the succession was secured to her children. As long as\r\nshe lived Blanche ruled Navarre in her own right, and on her death in\r\n1442 her son, Charles of Viana, was entitled to the crown of [Sidenote:\r\nJohn II. and Charles of Viana.] Navarre. He actually undertook the\r\nadministration of the kingdom; but in deference, apparently, to his\r\nmother’s wishes, he forbore to assume the royal title, which was still\r\nborne by his father. In the ordinary course of things, no special\r\ndifficulty need have arisen, as Charles would have succeeded his father\r\nin Aragon as well as Navarre. But in 1447 John concluded a second\r\nmarriage with Joanna Henriquez, daughter of the Admiral of Castile, and\r\na woman of equal energy and ambition. She persuaded her husband to\r\nintrust her with the administration of Navarre, and Charles of Viana\r\nfound plenty of advisers to remind him that the kingdom was lawfully his\r\nown, and to urge resistance to such an encroachment upon his authority.\r\nHence arose a civil war between the father and the stepmother on the one\r\nside, and the son on the other. The great Navarrese families of Beaumont\r\nand Egremont, as uniformly hostile to each other as the Orsini and\r\nColonnas in Rome, gladly welcomed so congenial a pretext for warfare.\r\nThe Beaumonts were intimately associated with Charles, so the Egremonts\r\nhad perforce to espouse the cause of his father. At Aybar, in 1452, the\r\nroyal troops won the victory, and Charles fell a prisoner into his\r\nfather’s hands. He was released soon afterwards, but his power had been\r\ndestroyed by his defeat, and his position was rendered worse by the\r\nbirth of a son, afterwards Ferdinand the Catholic, to the queen in 1452.\r\nJoanna hardly concealed her intention to secure the recognition of her\r\nown son as heir to his father, and her influence over John was\r\nunbounded. The unfortunate prince of Viana set out to Naples in 1458 to\r\nimplore the advice and assistance of his uncle Alfonso V. But Alfonso\r\ndied in 1458, and John was now king in Aragon instead of merely\r\nlieutenant for his brother. In 1460 Charles of Viana ventured to return\r\nto his father’s kingdom, and, after a feigned welcome, was thrown into\r\nprison at Lerida. This gross injustice—for there was no shadow of a\r\ncharge to be brought against the prince—excited a rebellion among the\r\nliberty-loving Catalans. The revolt rapidly spread to the other\r\nprovinces, and the king of Castile showed a suspicious interest in the\r\nwelfare of the heir to the crown of Aragon. John II. found it politic to\r\nyield to such general pressure. Charles of Viana was released and\r\nappointed governor of Catalonia, but before he could undertake the rule\r\nof his province he was removed by poison.\r\n\r\nThis terrible crime enabled John to retain possession of Navarre for his\r\nlifetime, but it rather increased his difficulties [Sidenote: Rebellion\r\nin Catalonia.] in his lawful kingdom. The Catalans renewed their\r\nrebellion to avenge the death of the prince whose cause they had\r\nchampioned with such fatal results, and besieged the queen and her son\r\nin the fortress of Gerona. Unable to force his way through to their aid,\r\nJohn was compelled to purchase the assistance of Louis XI. of France by\r\npledging the provinces of Roussillon and Cerdagne to cover his expenses.\r\nFrench troops raised the siege of Gerona, but the Catalans maintained an\r\nobstinate resistance. They went so far as to offer the crown to Réné le\r\nBon of Anjou and Provence, who was a grandson, through his mother, of\r\nJohn I. Réné, old, and averse to risk or exertion, sent his chivalrous\r\nson, John of Calabria, who had already fought a desperate war against\r\nthe reigning Aragonese king of Naples (see p. 277), to carry on the war\r\nwith the same family on the soil of Aragon. For a time John was almost\r\nin despair. He had become blind, and in 1468 he lost the wife whom he\r\nhad loved and trusted too well. But the old man fought on with a dogged\r\nobstinacy which deserved its reward. In 1469 John of Calabria died, and\r\nin 1472 the fall of Barcelona completed the reduction of Catalonia. On\r\nhis death in 1479 John bequeathed to Ferdinand an inheritance which was\r\nonly diminished by the loss of Roussillon and Cerdagne, and these\r\nprovinces were restored by Charles VIII. in 1493 in the hope of\r\npreventing the sending of aid from Aragon or Sicily to the bastard ruler\r\nof Naples, whom Charles was preparing to attack.\r\n\r\nDeath had at last relaxed the tenacious grip which John II. had so long\r\nmaintained upon the kingdom of Navarre. Of his three children by his\r\nfirst wife Blanche—Charles [Sidenote: Navarre after 1479.] of Viana,\r\nBlanche, and Eleanor—only the last, who had married Gaston de Foix,\r\nsurvived her father; Charles had been poisoned by his father, and\r\nBlanche had been poisoned by her sister. And, after all, Eleanor only\r\noutlived her father for a few weeks. Her grandson, Francis Phœbus,\r\nsucceeded her, but died in 1483, and his sister Catharine carried the\r\nkingdom to the house of d’Albret. From this family Ferdinand the\r\nCatholic wrested that part of Navarre which lay on the Spanish side of\r\nthe Pyrenees. The remainder came to the house of Bourbon by the marriage\r\nof duke Antony to Jeanne d’Albret, and by the accession of their son\r\nHenry IV. to the throne was ultimately annexed to France. When in the\r\nfollowing century Roussillon and Cerdagne were finally handed over to\r\nthe same state (1659), the Pyrenees at last became, as nature seemed to\r\nhave intended, although history was always thwarting her intention, a\r\nboundary between two separate states.\r\n\r\nThe union of Castile and Aragon by the accession in the two kingdoms of\r\nIsabella (1474) and Ferdinand (1479) laid the foundations of a kingdom\r\nof Spain, and [Sidenote: Union of Castile and Aragon.] opened the way\r\nfor a brief period of Spanish predominance in Europe. Yet the union of\r\nthe kingdoms was merely personal: it was no more, in some ways it was\r\neven less, than the union of England and Scotland effected by the\r\naccession of James I. in the former kingdom in 1603. The great states of\r\nthe peninsula were not welded into one; they remained distinct units,\r\neach with its own national characteristics, its own laws and\r\ninstitutions, its own sense of corporate life and interests. This\r\nimperfection of the union is a fundamental fact in later Spanish\r\nhistory; it marks the essential difference between Spain and its more\r\nsuccessful neighbour France; it is a chief cause of the rapid and\r\napparently irreparable decline of Spain in a later age. Nevertheless, in\r\nspite of its defects, the union was a necessary condition of the\r\nemergence of Spain from its mediæval isolation. The very want of harmony\r\namong the component states contributed to the rise of the royal power,\r\nand the strength and weakness of Spain were equally bound up with the\r\nfate of the monarchy. Without the forces of Aragon it would have been\r\nimpossible for Isabella to put down the disorderly independence of the\r\nCastilian nobles, or for Charles V. to repress the communes and to\r\ndegrade the Cortes to impotence. And without the forces of Castile\r\nPhilip II. could never have ventured to trample upon the hardy liberties\r\nof Aragon.\r\n\r\nThe grand period of Spanish history, and even great part of the reigns\r\nof Ferdinand and Isabella, lie beyond the limits of this volume, which\r\nis only concerned with [Sidenote: Government of Ferdinand and Isabella.]\r\nthe earlier achievements of these monarchs. The primary duty of the\r\nqueen was to strike at the independence of the Castilian nobles, and to\r\nput an end to the lawless anarchy which had reached its height under the\r\nfeeble rule of her brother. For this purpose she found an instrument\r\nready to her hand in the time-honoured privileges of the burgher class.\r\nIn 1476 she proposed and carried in the Cortes the organisation of the\r\n_Santa Hermandad_, or Holy Brotherhood, which was to supply a force of\r\ncivic police on a most extensive scale. Its affairs were managed by a\r\ncentral junta, composed of deputies from all the cities of Castile,\r\nwhich was convened once a year. A small army of two thousand cavalry,\r\nwith attendant archers, was formed to enforce the decisions of local\r\nmagistrates and of the supreme court. The nobles protested against the\r\nmeasure as unconstitutional, but the protest of the chief evil-doers is\r\na proof of its value and its efficiency. Other measures followed in\r\nrapid succession. The extravagant grants of lands and pensions which had\r\nbeen made to the nobles in recent years were revoked, the fortresses\r\nwhich had served as centres of brigandage were destroyed, and steps were\r\ntaken to codify the numerous laws which had been enacted since the reign\r\nof Alfonso X. The grandmasterships of the orders of Calatrava,\r\nAlcantara, and St. James, which conferred upon their holders powers too\r\ngreat to be safely intrusted to subjects, were on successive vacancies\r\nannexed to the crown. And the strengthened monarchy showed itself the\r\nenlightened protector of the material interests of its subjects. Trade\r\nand industry were encouraged by the remodelling of taxation, by a\r\nmuch-needed reform of the currency, and by the removal of the barriers\r\nto commercial intercourse between Castile and Aragon. It has been\r\nreckoned that the royal revenue, without any increased charges upon the\r\npeople, was multiplied thirty-fold between Isabella’s accession in 1474\r\nand her death in 1504.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of rulers have their defects, and Isabella’s were a\r\nfanatical hatred of heresy and a feminine passion for religious\r\nuniformity. There can be no doubt that her influence predominated in\r\nbringing about [Sidenote: The Spanish Inquisition.] the introduction of\r\nthe Inquisition, which was authorised by a bull of Sixtus IV. in 1478,\r\nand was set in working in 1483 under the presidency of Torquemada. It\r\nmay be regarded as the first institution of a united Spain. Its\r\nextension to Aragon excited much opposition among the liberty-loving\r\npeople, but the iron will of Ferdinand proved irresistible. One of the\r\nfirst outcomes of religious persecution was the expulsion of the Jews in\r\n1492. Some two hundred thousand Jews are said to have been driven from\r\nSpain by this edict. It was a cruel measure, but it was not so\r\ndisastrous as it has been represented by some writers, who seem to have\r\nforgotten that it was followed, not by the immediate decline of Spain,\r\nbut by a period of unexampled prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe first overt proof to the world that a new power had arisen in Spain\r\nwas furnished by the final extinction of the [Sidenote: Conquest of\r\nGranada.] Moorish dominion in the peninsula. The most signal\r\nillustration of the weakness caused by the internal disorders of Castile\r\nfor the last two hundred years is to be found in the prolonged existence\r\nof the kingdom of Granada. The establishment of a united and efficient\r\nstate upon their borders was fatal to the Moors. The war began in 1481,\r\nand was steadily but not impetuously prosecuted for ten years. On\r\nNovember 25, 1491, the capitulation of the Moorish capital was signed.\r\nThe terms granted to the conquered were as liberal as prudent policy\r\ncould dictate or as their heroic resistance had deserved. Full liberty\r\nas to the exercise of their religion and the maintenance of their own\r\nlaws was granted to all who would peacefully submit to Christian rule.\r\nBut unfortunately the terms were not observed. After seven years of\r\ntranquillity the bigotry of the Castilian government proved stronger\r\nthan considerations either of honour or of policy. The Moors were\r\nsuddenly called upon to choose between conversion and exile. Those who\r\naccepted the former alternative had to live under a sort of ban in the\r\nmidst of an alien and hostile majority, until the insane edict of\r\nexpulsion against the Moriscoes in 1609 deprived Spain of a harmless and\r\nindustrious element of its population just at the time when it could\r\nleast afford to lose them.\r\n\r\nIn one great department of activity—geographical discovery and\r\nexpansion—Spain was anticipated and to some extent [Sidenote: Portugal.]\r\nguided by her neighbour Portugal. Portugal began life as one of the\r\nstruggling Christian states of Spain, with no essential difference from\r\nthe other petty counties or kingdoms which were in the end combined to\r\nform larger states. Gradually Portugal had been hardened into something\r\nlike nationality by a long struggle, first to secure its existence\r\nagainst the Moors, and then to resist that absorption into Castile which\r\nconsiderations of geography and race seemed to render not only natural,\r\nbut almost inevitable. The first end was achieved by the victories of\r\nAlfonso I. (1112-1185), who exchanged the title of count for that of\r\nking; the second by the victory of Aljubarrota in 1385 (see above, p.\r\n474), and the wise government of John I. (1383-1433). It was in the\r\nreign of the latter that Portugal [Sidenote: Geographical discovery.]\r\nbegan to interest itself in the task of exploring the west coast of\r\nAfrica, which was destined to bring to the small kingdom such a lavish\r\nmeasure of wealth and renown. His third son, who was also the grandson\r\nof an Englishman, John of Gaunt, was the famous Prince Henry the\r\nNavigator. He was inspired with a confident belief that it was possible\r\nto sail round Africa, and that the Portuguese might by this route divert\r\nto themselves the great gains which the Venetians and Genoese enjoyed\r\nfrom their indirect trade with India through the Levant. His dream was\r\nnot fulfilled during his own lifetime, but his efforts contributed to\r\nits later realisation. For forty years he laboured to fit out\r\nexpeditions for African exploration, and to these were due the\r\nsuccessive discovery, or in some cases the re-discovery, of Porto Santo\r\n(1419), Madeira (1420), the Canaries, which were later surrendered to\r\nCastile, the Azores (1431-1444), the White Cape or Cabo Blanco (1441),\r\nand Cape Verde (1446). When once the great shoulder of Africa had been\r\nrounded it was easy to reach the Guinea coast. The death of Prince Henry\r\nin 1460 checked, but did not arrest the progress of discovery. Africa\r\nhad been found to produce one very valuable commodity—slaves—and\r\nPortugal was keenly interested in the lucrative but demoralising\r\nslave-trade. This served to stimulate frequent voyages to the west coast\r\nof Africa, and it was certain that before long some of the more\r\nadventurous sailors would be induced, either by design or by accident,\r\nto prolong their journeys. Moreover, as the fifteenth century advanced,\r\nthe impulse to find a new route to India became constantly stronger. The\r\nLevant was becoming more and more a Turkish lake. First the coast of\r\nAsia Minor and then Constantinople fell into their hands. There was a\r\ngrowing danger that the great markets in which the Venetians and Genoese\r\nhad purchased from Arab caravans the products of the East would be\r\nclosed to Christian merchants. Europe could not afford to dispense with\r\ncommodities which had become almost necessaries to her peoples, or to\r\npurchase them upon terms which drained the western countries of their\r\nall too scanty supply of the precious metals. A great prize was offered\r\nto the discoverers of a direct maritime connection with India, and the\r\ncompetition became more and more keen. Portugal, thanks to Prince Henry,\r\nhad been first in the race, and she deservedly won the prize. In 1486\r\nBartholomew Diaz reached Algoa [Sidenote: The Cape route to India.] Bay,\r\nhaving at last rounded the Cape, to which he gave the well-merited name\r\nof _Cabo Tormentoso_, or the stormy cape; though King John II., with\r\ngreater prescience and less familiarity, insisted upon calling it the\r\nCape of Good Hope. Twelve years later, in 1498, Vasco da Gama completed\r\nthe work by conducting a continuous voyage from Lisbon to Calicut.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Castile had attempted to solve the great problem of the age.\r\nBy the treaty of 1479, when Isabella was recognised and the claims of\r\nJoanna were abandoned by her uncle and husband, Alfonso V., Portugal had\r\ngiven up the Canaries, but had received the confirmation of past and\r\nfuture discoveries on the African coast. Thus Spain was debarred from\r\ncompeting with Portugal on the route to India which Henry the Navigator\r\nhad pointed out. But Christopher Columbus, a Genoese mariner who entered\r\n[Sidenote: Discovery of America.] the service of Castile, proposed to\r\nfind a way to Asia by sailing westwards. In 1492 the first of his\r\never-famous voyages brought him to land which he conceived to be part of\r\nIndia. He had really found the new world of America, but his fruitful\r\nerror has given to the islands at which he first touched the name of the\r\nWest Indies.\r\n\r\nThese two discoveries, of America and of the route to India round the\r\nCape, are perhaps the greatest events of the fifteenth century. They\r\nbrought men face to face with new problems, new conceptions, new\r\ninterests, [Sidenote: Partition of the New World.] which have drawn a\r\nconspicuous line of demarcation between the Middle Ages and later times.\r\nBut these belong to a subsequent period. The most immediate result was\r\nto create a danger of collision between Spain and Portugal, which\r\ncontemporary statesmanship set itself to avert. A bull of Alexander VI.\r\nin 1493 drew an imaginary line a hundred leagues west of the Azores, and\r\ngave the countries to the west of the line to Spain and those to the\r\neast to Portugal. This arrangement was modified in the next year by the\r\ntreaty of Tordesillas between the two countries, which shifted the line\r\nof demarcation some hundred and seventy leagues farther west. This\r\nserved to give to Portugal its subsequent claim to Brazil. But the\r\nmonstrous pretension of the two pioneers of discovery to monopolise all\r\nits fruits to themselves provoked before long the vigorous resistance of\r\nnorthern countries which were equally fitted by geography for oceanic\r\ntrade. When Spain in 1580 annexed Portugal, the struggle against a\r\nsingle monopoly became more desperate; and it was this, even more than\r\ndifferences of religion, which led to those prolonged wars with the\r\nEnglish and Dutch in which the power of Spain was shattered.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  See Genealogical Table Q, in Appendix.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  See Genealogical Table R, in Appendix.\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  See Genealogical Table S, in Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n                 THE GREEK EMPIRE AND THE OTTOMAN TURKS\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Greek Empire after the recovery of Constantinople in 1261—The\r\n    reigns of Michael VIII. and Andronicus II.—The Grand Company of the\r\n    Catalans—Civil war and deposition of Andronicus II.—The Seljuk and\r\n    Ottoman Turks—Conquests of Othman and Orchan—The tribute of\r\n    children—John V. and John Cantacuzenos—Stephen Dushan and the Empire\r\n    of Servia—First conquests of the Turks in Europe—Vassalage of the\r\n    Greek Empire—Turkish successes against the Slavonic States—Bajazet\r\n    I. attacks Constantinople—Battle of Angora—Revival of the Ottoman\r\n    power—The Emperor John VI. and the Council of Florence—Wars of\r\n    Amurath II. with Hungary—Revolt of Albania under Scanderbeg—Mohammed\r\n    II. takes Constantinople—Conquest of Servia, Wallachia, and\r\n    Bosnia—Conquest of Greece—War with Venice—The Turks in Otranto—Death\r\n    of Mohammed the Conqueror.\r\n\r\nIt is not a little curious that the two powers which claimed to\r\nrepresent the ancient Empire of Rome both perished in the thirteenth\r\ncentury. The fall of the Hohenstaufen [Sidenote: The Greek Empire after\r\n1261.] and the Great Interregnum mark the real end of the western\r\nEmpire. Henceforth it is nothing more than a feeble kingship of Germany\r\nwith a shadowy claim to suzerainty over Italy. The eastern Empire was\r\nannihilated by the destructive triumph of the Crusaders in 1204. Its\r\nso-called revival in 1261 was merely the recovery of Constantinople by a\r\nprince who had previously ruled in Nicæa. The rule of Michael Palæologus\r\nand his successors, though the forms of ceremonies of Roman tradition\r\nwere carefully maintained, has no claim to be called a Roman Empire at\r\nall; at the most, it is a Greek or Byzantine Empire. Their territories\r\nwere smaller than those of several of the western kings. In Europe they\r\nheld little more than Constantinople itself, with the adjacent district\r\nof Roumelia and the peninsula of Chalcidice. To the north and west they\r\nwere hemmed in by the independent kingdoms of Bulgaria and Servia. The\r\ngreater part of the Morea was split up into small states in the hands\r\neither of Frankish princes or of Venice. Venice also held the important\r\nislands of Corfu, Crete, and Negropont, and many of the lesser islands\r\nin the Ægean were ruled by Venetian families. In Asia Minor the\r\nPalæologi succeeded in retaining for a time the greater part of the west\r\ncoast with a few towns on the Black Sea; but the rest of the peninsula\r\nwas in the hands of the Turkish sultans of Iconium, with the exception\r\nof a small strip in the south-eastern corner of the Black Sea, which\r\nconstituted the so-called Empire of Trebizond. It is true that Michael\r\nVIII. himself, and even some of his feeble successors, made a few\r\nacquisitions of territory, especially in the Morea, but these were\r\ncounterbalanced by quite equal losses. The Knights of St. John, who\r\nlived in Crete for a few years after their expulsion from Acre in 1291,\r\nseized Rhodes and the small adjacent islands in 1310. And the Genoese,\r\nwho had rendered valuable service in the war with the Latin emperors,\r\ndemanded very large concessions as their reward. Not only did they\r\nreceive the suburb of Pera or Galata, which they fortified against the\r\nGreek emperors, but they established their power at Kaffa in the Crimea,\r\nand in Azof, at the mouth of the Don, thus securing a monopoly of the\r\nBlack Sea trade, and they also seized upon the islands of Lesbos and\r\nChios.\r\n\r\nIt is a sorry task to trace the fortunes of the decadent Greek Empire\r\nduring the two centuries that were secured to it, not by any ability on\r\nthe part of its rulers or any heroism on the part of their subjects, but\r\npartly by a series of accidents which checked the advance of encroaching\r\nneighbours, and partly by the extraordinary defensive strength of the\r\ncapital. There is hardly a single episode in this period of Greek\r\nhistory that inspires any interest or would deserve any attention, but\r\nthat the weakness of the Empire was a prominent cause of that rapid rise\r\nof the Ottoman Turks which is one of the great events in history. In\r\nConstantinople itself there is little to record except miserable court\r\njealousies and intrigues, and the most puerile discussions of minute\r\nquestions of religious dogma. The recent establishment of Latin rule had\r\ninspired the Greeks with a bitter hatred of Roman Catholicism, and at\r\nthe same time with a consciousness of their own weakness. Hence the\r\nstolid conservatism which characterised the administration in both\r\nChurch and State under the Palæologi. ‘The Greeks gloried in the name of\r\nRomans; they clung to the forms of the imperial government without its\r\nmilitary power; they retained the Roman code without the systematic\r\nadministration of justice, and prided themselves on the orthodoxy of a\r\nChurch in which the clergy were deprived of all ecclesiastical\r\nindependence, and lived in a state of vassalage to the imperial Court.\r\nSuch a society could only wither, though it might wither slowly’\r\n(Finlay).\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Latin Empire could not take place without causing a\r\nsensation in western Europe, and for some time Michael VIII. had to fear\r\na possible attempt to effect its restoration. Charles of Anjou, who as\r\n[Sidenote: Michael VIII. and Andronicus II.] the champion of the Papacy\r\nhas gained Naples and Sicily from the Hohenstaufen, twice pledged\r\nhimself to carry his victorious forces across the Adriatic, in 1266 by\r\nthe treaty of Viterbo with the exiled Baldwin II., and in 1281 by the\r\ntreaty of Orvieto with Venice and Pope Martin IV. So alarmed was Michael\r\nVIII., that he resorted to the last expedient of a Greek emperor in\r\ndistress, and sought to conciliate the Pope by offering to bring about\r\nthe union of the Greek with the Latin Church. But his pusillanimity made\r\nhim unpopular with his subjects, and proved to be wholly unnecessary.\r\nBoth schemes of the Neapolitan king were rendered abortive; the former\r\nby the attack of the luckless Conradin in 1267, the latter by the\r\nSicilian Vespers in 1282 (see p. 25). These events enabled Michael, who\r\ndied in the latter year, to leave an undiminished dominion to his son,\r\nAndronicus II. The new emperor was as superstitious and as timidly\r\northodox as any of his bishops could desire, and his personal character\r\nwas far better than that of the majority of Eastern despots; but he was\r\na thoroughly worthless and incompetent ruler. His long reign, which\r\nlasted from 1282 to 1328, was marked by three events which brought the\r\nEmpire to the verge of ruin. Ruling over a comparatively small and\r\nunwarlike population, the Greek emperors after 1261 were peculiarly\r\ndependent upon mercenary troops for either defensive or aggressive\r\nwarfare. In 1303 chance gave to Andronicus the service of perhaps the\r\nfinest fighting force in Europe at that time. The twenty years’ struggle\r\nfor the possession of Sicily between the houses of Anjou and Aragon had\r\njust ended in the victory of the latter, and Frederick I. of Sicily was\r\nnot unwilling to rid himself of the hardy soldiers from Catalonia and\r\nthe other Aragonese provinces who had gained him his crown, but were\r\nlikely to be a source of trouble and disorder now that peace had been\r\nconcluded. Under the leadership of a brilliant adventurer, Roger de\r\nFlor, these men were formed [Sidenote: The Grand Company.] into the\r\n‘Grand Company of the Catalans,’ and were transported to the eastern\r\nEmpire. Properly led, these troops might have taken advantage of the\r\ndismemberment of the Seljuk dominions to gain the whole of Asia Minor\r\nfor the Palæologi. But Andronicus II. was incapable of even planning so\r\nambitious a project. The strength of the Company was wasted in petty\r\noperations; and when the withholding of arrears of pay provoked a\r\nmutiny, the emperor recklessly endeavoured to intimidate the mercenaries\r\nby procuring the assassination of their idolised commander. Vowing\r\nvengeance, the Catalans turned their arms against their employer, routed\r\nthe armies that were sent against them, and for the next few years lived\r\nin luxurious idleness upon the spoils which they wrested from the\r\nemperor’s unfortunate subjects. Nor was it possible to expel them, and\r\nthey only quitted the dominions of Andronicus when they were tempted in\r\n1310 to enter the service of the duke of Athens. The emperor’s last\r\nyears were darkened by a civil war which was almost as disastrous as his\r\nquarrel with the foreign mercenaries. His grandson, another Andronicus,\r\na [Sidenote: Civil war, 1321-1328.] young man of considerable ability\r\nbut of vicious habits, raised the standard of rebellion in 1321 because\r\nhe was not admitted to the position of joint-emperor which had been held\r\nby his father till his death in the previous year. The war was\r\ninterrupted by several futile attempts to bring about a reconciliation;\r\nbut at last the partisans of the young prince, among whom John\r\nCantacuzenos was the most prominent, gained a complete victory in 1328,\r\nwhen the capital was taken and Andronicus II. was deposed in favour of\r\nhis grandson. Four years later the aged emperor died, after having been\r\ncompelled to become a monk in order to render his restoration\r\nimpossible. The terrible waste of force in the ravages of the Grand\r\nCompany and the miserable contest between grandfather and grandson are\r\nthe more significant when it is remembered that in this reign occurred\r\nthe first collision between the Greek Empire and its destined\r\ndestroyers, the Ottoman Turks.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Turks, or Osmanlis, as they call themselves, were by no\r\nmeans the only or the earliest members of the [Sidenote: The Ottoman\r\nTurks.] Turkish race to gain distinction. Long before their appearance\r\nin history the Seljuk Turks had risen to ascendency in western Asia,\r\nfirst as the soldiers and then as the masters of the Saracen caliphs. A\r\nSeljuk dynasty established itself in the eleventh century in Nicæa with\r\nthe title of Sultans of Rome, as ruling over great part of the Roman\r\nEmpire. The early crusades had aided the Eastern emperors to drive the\r\nTurks back from Nicæa to Iconium, but they remained the dominant power\r\nin Asia Minor. The disruption of the eastern Empire after the Fourth\r\nCrusade would probably have enabled the Seljuks to extend their\r\ndominions if they had not been at the same time exposed to attacks from\r\nthe Moguls in the east. It was in this war that we first hear of the\r\nOttoman Turks. One of the sultans of Iconium was hard pressed in battle\r\nby the Moguls, when the scale was turned by the intervention of a small\r\nbut warlike band of Turks under Ertogrul, the father of Othman, from\r\nwhom their later name was derived. The grateful sultan rewarded his\r\nunexpected auxiliaries with a considerable grant of lands; and when the\r\nSeljuk power was broken up on the death of Aladdin III. in 1307, Othman\r\nwas one of the numerous emirs who acquired independence. Among these\r\nemirs Othman and his successors gradually rose to acknowledged\r\npre-eminence, chiefly through their victories at the expense of the\r\nGreek emperors, which attracted to their service the ablest and most\r\nambitious Turks from [Sidenote: Conquests of Othman and Orchan.] the\r\nother provinces. Just before Othman’s death in 1326 his forces captured\r\nthe Greek city of Brusa, which became the Asiatic capital of the\r\nOttomans. Under his son and successor, Orchan, the Turkish power made\r\nimmense strides. Orchan’s first enterprise was the attack on Nicæa,\r\nwhich may be regarded as the second capital of the Byzantine Empire. No\r\nformal siege was laid to the city, but the Turks constructed strong\r\nforts in the neighbourhood, from which they could harass the inhabitants\r\nand cut off supplies of water and food. Andronicus III. and his\r\nminister, John Cantacuzenos, crossed the Bosphorus to attempt the relief\r\nof Nicæa, but were defeated at Pelekanon (1329), the first battle in\r\nwhich a Greek emperor confronted the Ottoman Turks in arms. Nicæa\r\nsurrendered in 1330, and was treated with such leniency as to create a\r\ntemporary impression that the Greeks would be better off under Turkish\r\nthan under Byzantine rule. The military incapacity of the emperor\r\nallowed Orchan to continue his aggressions with comparative ease; and at\r\nthe end of the next ten years the only territories retained by\r\nAndronicus in Asia Minor were the two towns of Phocæa and Philadelphia,\r\ntogether with a small strip of territory along the eastern coast of the\r\nBosphorus.\r\n\r\nOrchan is famous in Turkish history not only as a conqueror, but also as\r\na legislator and administrator. One of his institutions proved\r\ninvaluable to his successors. The law of Mohammed offered two\r\nalternatives to unbelievers—the Koran or tribute. By payment of tribute\r\nthe conquered could purchase the security of life and property and the\r\npermission to retain their own religious worship. [Sidenote: The tribute\r\nchildren.] Orchan introduced the innovation of exacting this tribute not\r\nonly in money or goods, but in children. Every Christian village was\r\ncompelled to furnish every year a fixed proportion of the strongest and\r\nmost promising boys about eight years of age. These children were\r\nbrought up in the Mohammedan religion, and were educated with the\r\ngreatest care both for body and mind. As they grew older, according as\r\nthey excelled in mental or physical qualities, they were drafted either\r\ninto the civil administration or into the army. The civil servants taken\r\nfrom these children formed an administrative body, which was under the\r\nabsolute control of the sultan, and was more efficient than could be\r\nfound in any other country at that time. The troops were still more\r\nserviceable. They constituted the famous Janissaries (_Yeni Tcheri_ or\r\nnew troops), who for two centuries were unsurpassed by any other\r\nmilitary force. With diabolical ingenuity the Turks secured the victory\r\nof the Crescent by the children of the Cross, and trained up Christian\r\nboys to destroy the independence and authority of their country and\r\ntheir Church.\r\n\r\nA critical period in Byzantine history followed the death of Andronicus\r\nIII. in 1341. His young son, John V., was left [Sidenote: John V. and\r\nJohn Cantacuzenos.] under the regency of his mother, Anne of Savoy. But\r\nthe authority of the regent was disputed by John Cantacuzenos, who had\r\nbeen virtual prime minister under Andronicus, and was now persuaded by\r\nhis partisans to assume the imperial title. A prolonged strife of\r\nfactions followed, in which both sides were base enough to appeal for\r\nthe support of the Turks. Cantacuzenos was successful in gaining Orchan\r\nto his side, but by a bargain which even Greek morality considered\r\ndisgraceful. His daughter was married to the Mussulman sultan, and was\r\nsent to reside in the harem at Brusa. But the complaisant father\r\nachieved his object. In 1347 he was recognised as emperor by the\r\nempress-regent, and was to be allowed to hold the executive authority\r\nfor ten years, when it was to be shared with John V., who was to marry\r\nHelena, another daughter of Cantacuzenos. The latter was now crowned\r\nagain with his wife, and John V. was also crowned with his bride. Thus\r\nConstantinople witnessed the unique pageant of two emperors and three\r\nempresses at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis civil war had not only given to the Turks a dangerous insight and\r\ninfluence in Greek politics, it had also enabled a rival power to extend\r\nitself on the western side of the empire. Stephen Dushan, who had become\r\nking [Sidenote: Conquests of Stephen Dushan.] of Servia in 1333, took\r\nadvantage of the anarchy in Constantinople to seize Albania, Epirus, and\r\nThessaly, and thus to extend his dominions to the Adriatic on one side\r\nand to the Ægean on the other. He assumed the title of Emperor of\r\nRoumania, Slavonia, and Albania. It would probably have been for the\r\nultimate advantage of Europe if he could have extinguished the Greek\r\nempire altogether by the conquest of Constantinople. But he was not\r\nstrong enough to do this, and his territories were divided after his\r\ndeath in 1355. His conquests left the European dominions of Byzantium\r\nhardly larger than those in Asia. Besides the capital, with the adjacent\r\npart of Thrace, there were Thessalonica and another strip of territory,\r\nabout a third of the Morea, and a few islands in the Ægean. Even between\r\nConstantinople and Thessalonica there was no secure communication except\r\nby sea, as the intervening territory was held by Servia.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of 1347 was not likely to bring about lasting peace in\r\nConstantinople, and in 1351 a quarrel between John V. and his\r\nfather-in-law gives us another illustration of the weakness of the\r\nempire. The dispute became mixed up with the standing quarrel between\r\nthe Venetians and the Genoese. The Genoese maintained that alliance with\r\nthe Palæologi which had given them their predominance [Sidenote: Renewed\r\ndisorder in Constantinople.] in the east, and therefore Cantacuzenos\r\ntried to overthrow them by obtaining the support of Venice. The two\r\nItalian republics fought out their own quarrel in Greek waters, without\r\nmuch regard to the interests of their allies. The Venetians were\r\ndefeated in 1352 in a great naval battle fought within sight of\r\nConstantinople, and Cantacuzenos was compelled to confirm all the\r\nprivileges of the victors. His authority never recovered from the blow,\r\nand in 1354 he was compelled to abdicate and become a monk.\r\n\r\nThe same year in which John V. became sole emperor witnessed the first\r\npermanent establishment of the Turks [Sidenote: The Turks in Europe.]\r\nupon European soil. Hitherto they had only appeared either as plunderers\r\nor as the auxiliaries of Cantacuzenos. But in 1354 Suleiman, Orchan’s\r\neldest son, took advantage of an earthquake, which had destroyed the\r\nwalls of many towns in Thrace, to seize and garrison Gallipoli. John V.,\r\nafraid that the Turks might support Matthew Cantacuzenos, who claimed to\r\ntake his father’s place as emperor, was unable to attempt their\r\nexpulsion, and Gallipoli became the basis for later conquests. Suleiman\r\ndied in 1358, and Orchan in 1359; but the new sultan, Amurath or Murad\r\nI., added one city after another to his rule, till in 1361 he made\r\nhimself master of Adrianople, which became the European capital of the\r\nTurks for nearly a century. The fact that these early conquests of\r\nAmurath were gained without serious opposition in the districts in which\r\nthe party of Cantacuzenos had been most numerous seems to show that\r\nfaction had overpowered all sense of patriotism among the Greeks. The\r\nconquest of Adrianople brought the Turks to the northern boundary of the\r\nByzantine empire, and for the next few years they were occupied with\r\nwars against the Slavonic states—Bulgaria, Servia, and Bosnia—great\r\nparts of which were conquered or compelled to pay tribute.\r\n\r\nJohn V., finding himself surrounded by the growing dominions of the\r\ninfidel, made desperate efforts to obtain aid from western Europe. In\r\n1369 he [Sidenote: Vassalage of the Empire.] actually went to Rome to\r\nmeet Urban V., who had just returned to his capital, and agreed to a\r\nwritten profession of faith, in which he accepted the Roman view on all\r\nthe questions at issue between the two Churches—that the procession of\r\nthe Holy Ghost is from both Father and Son; that unleavened bread may be\r\nused in the Sacrament; and that the Church of Rome is supreme in matters\r\nof faith and jurisdiction. But the document was worthless to either\r\nside. The emperor could not coerce the faith of his subjects, and the\r\nPapacy in the middle of the fourteenth century was powerless to rouse\r\nany crusading ardour among the European princes. Discouraged by the\r\nfailure of this negotiation, the pusillanimous emperor sought a still\r\nmore humiliating path to safety. He became the vassal of the Turkish\r\nsultan, allowed him to occupy Thessalonica; and when his own son\r\nAndronicus headed a successful rebellion, it was put down by Turkish aid\r\npurchased by a treaty which stipulated for the payment of tribute by the\r\nGreek emperor (1381).\r\n\r\nThe Slavonic states to the north and west of Constantinople offered a\r\nmore resolute, though not in the end a more successful resistance than\r\nthe Greeks. In 1387 a great [Sidenote: Turkish conquests in the north.]\r\nleague was formed for mutual protection, under the leadership of the\r\nking of Bosnia. For a time this checked the Ottoman advance; but in 1389\r\nAmurath won a complete victory over the allied forces at Kossova, where\r\nthe Servian king was slain. Amurath himself was killed after the battle\r\nby a Servian noble who pretended to be a deserter. But the murder\r\nbrought no gain to the Slavonic cause, as Bajazet I. succeeded at once\r\nto his father’s position and reaped all the fruits of the victory. The\r\nnew king of Servia had to give his sister in marriage to the sultan, and\r\nto promise both tribute and military service. Wallachia was also made to\r\npay tribute, and Bulgaria was annexed to the Ottoman dominions, which\r\nwere thus extended to the Danube. The most vigorous effort made by a\r\nEuropean combination against the infidel, when Sigismund of Hungary was\r\njoined by a band of French nobles under John of Nevers, heir to the\r\nduchy of Burgundy, only served to give another still more brilliant\r\nvictory to Bajazet under the walls of Nicopolis (1396). Sigismund\r\nnarrowly escaped captivity; and John the Fearless, as he was afterwards\r\ncalled, was only allowed to save the lives of twenty-four of his\r\nfellow-prisoners, who were to carry back to Europe the tale of the\r\nprowess and the fantastic mixture of cruelty and magnanimity displayed\r\nby their conqueror.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile John V. had died in 1391, and was succeeded by his second son,\r\nManuel II., the elder brother, Andronicus, having died in 1381. Manuel\r\nhad been compelled [Sidenote: First Turkish siege of Constantinople.] to\r\nlead a Greek contingent into Asia to aid Bajazet in taking Philadelphia,\r\none of the last cities in Asia Minor which retained its independence,\r\nand was still at Brusa when the news arrived of his father’s death. He\r\nsucceeded in escaping to Constantinople, but it was lucky for him that\r\nthe sultan was engaged in reducing to obedience the Seljuk emirates\r\nwhich had not yet recognised the supremacy of the Ottoman dynasty. This\r\nenabled Manuel to make good his position, but he had to accept the same\r\nsubjection as had been imposed upon his father. When, however, the great\r\ncoalition was formed under Sigismund to resist the Turks, Manuel had\r\nwelcomed the prospect of regaining his freedom, and Bajazet had learned\r\nhow little he could trust the fidelity of his imperial vassal. After his\r\nvictory at Nicopolis the sultan determined to inflict a signal\r\npunishment on all those tributary princes who had ventured to oppose\r\nhim. In 1397 he reduced Epirus and Thessaly, while Manuel was harassed\r\nby the recognition of his nephew John, the son of Andronicus, as\r\nemperor. Recognising the futility of relying upon his own strength to\r\nresist the sultan, Manuel came to terms with his nephew, admitted him as\r\na colleague, and left the administration in his hands, while he himself\r\nset out on a tour through western Europe to implore assistance. During\r\nhis absence Bajazet laid regular siege to Constantinople, and would\r\nprobably have completed its conquest if he had not been called away to\r\nAsia to resist the attack of the great Tartar leader, Timour, or\r\nTamerlane, who had already marched victoriously over the greater part of\r\nAsia. In the famous [Sidenote: Battle of Angora, 1402.] battle of\r\nAngora, the Ottoman Turks met with a crushing defeat (1402). Bajazet\r\nhimself fell into the conqueror’s hands, and was still a captive when he\r\ndied in 1403.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Angora gave Constantinople a reprieve for fifty years.\r\nManuel, whose western journey had given him little beyond experience and\r\ndiscouragement, was unexpectedly able to return to his capital and to\r\nbanish the nephew whom necessity rather than affection had compelled him\r\nto admit as a colleague. It is true that he had to pacify Timour by\r\npaying to him the same tribute as he had owed to Bajazet. But the Tartar\r\nhad too much to do in the east to undertake the conquest of Europe, and\r\nhis destructive career came to an end in 1405 as he was on his way to\r\nattempt the subjugation of China. The Ottoman power seemed to be\r\nannihilated. Not only did the Seljuk emirs in Asia recover their\r\nindependence, but for ten years after Bajazet’s death his four sons\r\ncarried on a fratricidal struggle for the succession. Yet all that the\r\nEmperor Manuel could gain from such extraordinary good fortune was the\r\nrecovery of Thessalonica and a few districts in Thessaly and Epirus.\r\nWhen in 1413 Mohammed I. succeeded in reuniting his [Sidenote: Revival\r\nof the Ottoman power.] father’s dominions, the Greek emperor with the\r\nother European vassals hastened to renew their submission; and the\r\nsultan met with so little difficulty in Europe, that he was able to\r\ndevote the remaining eight years of his reign to the reduction of the\r\nprinces of Caramania and other opponents in Asia. The extraordinary\r\nrapidity with which the Ottomans recovered their power after the\r\napparently shattering blow of 1402 proves that their authority, thanks\r\nto the wisdom and ingenuity of Orchan, rested upon far stronger\r\nfoundations than that of any other Asiatic conquerors.\r\n\r\nMohammed I. was succeeded in 1421 by his son Amurath II. Manuel\r\nPalæologus, rendered confident by the unbroken peace of the last few\r\nyears, was bold enough to stir up opposition against the new sultan by\r\nsupporting a pretender who claimed to be a son of Bajazet. Amurath had\r\nno difficulty in defeating and putting to death the rival claimant, and\r\nin 1422 he undertook another siege of Constantinople in order to punish\r\nthe emperor’s insolence. An attempt to carry the walls by storm was\r\nrepulsed with heavy loss to the assailants, but the raising of the siege\r\nwas due to a rebellion in Asia in favour of a brother of the sultan.\r\nWhen in 1424 Amurath returned to Europe after putting down disorder in\r\nthe east, Manuel hastened to appease his wrath by the payment of\r\nincreased tribute and by the cession of several cities in Thrace.\r\n\r\nJohn VI., who succeeded his father, Manuel II., in 1425, was perhaps the\r\nfeeblest of all the Palæologi. His whole reign was spent in endeavouring\r\nto evade dangers [Sidenote: Reign of John VI.] which he was incapable of\r\nconfronting. The best known event of his reign is the Council which was\r\nheld in 1438 and 1439, first at Ferrara, and then at Florence, to\r\nnegotiate for the union of the eastern and western Churches (see p.\r\n236). As far as the powers of the Council went, the treaty of union was\r\nfully and finally ratified. But the Greeks could resist their own ruler\r\nwith more courage and confidence than they could face the infidel\r\nassailant, and such a storm of reprobation greeted the return of the\r\nemperor and the envoys that they hastened to disavow their formal acts.\r\nThe decrees of the Council of Florence remained a dead letter. It was\r\nfortunate for John that he had no occasion to rely either upon western\r\naid or upon the loyalty of his subjects. His very weakness and pliancy\r\ndisarmed hostility and avoided all occasions of rupture. His reign was a\r\nperiod of almost complete peace. Thessalonica, which had repudiated the\r\nrule of Constantinople and put itself under the protection of Venice,\r\nwas conquered by Amurath in 1430. But with this exception the Sultan\r\npaid little attention to the Byzantine empire, and devoted all his\r\nenergies to war with more formidable enemies in the north and west.\r\n\r\nIn 1427 a new king came to the throne of Servia, and set himself from\r\nthe first to repudiate the vassalage to which his predecessors had been\r\nsubjected since the great battle of Kossova. The Wallachians and\r\nBosnians were inspired by the same sentiments, and George [Sidenote:\r\nAmurath II.’s wars with Hungary.] of Servia purchased the aid of\r\nSigismund of Hungary by ceding the great border fortress of Belgrade.\r\nAgainst this powerful confederacy Amurath waged a successful war for\r\nseveral years. In 1438 he had advanced as far as Semendria; and Albert\r\nof Austria, who had succeeded Sigismund on the throne of Hungary, vainly\r\nendeavoured to compel the sultan to raise the siege. Semendria fell, but\r\nthe war was checked for a time by an outbreak of dysentery in both\r\narmies, and Albert perished of the disease. This was followed by an\r\nevent which for a moment turned the balance in favour of the Christians.\r\nIn 1440 Hungarians offered their vacant crown to Ladislas of Poland in\r\norder to enlist the aid of the great house of Jagellon. For four years\r\nthe combined Slavs and Magyars not only held their own against the\r\ndreaded Janissaries, but even gained some notable successes. Under the\r\nleadership of John Hunyadi the allies repulsed the Turks from the walls\r\nof Hermanstadt and defeated them in the open field (1442). In the next\r\nyear Hunyadi crossed the Danube, routed a Turkish army near Nissa, and\r\npursued the fugitives in a brilliant march across the Balkans. These\r\nsuccesses extorted from Amurath the treaty of Szegedin (July 12, 1444),\r\nby which he abandoned his suzerainty over Servia and Bosnia, and allowed\r\nWallachia to be annexed to Hungary. So chagrined was the sultan at this\r\nunexpected reverse, that he resigned the government to his son,\r\nMohammed, and retired to seclusion at Magnesia. This news inspired the\r\nChristian princes and prelates with the belief that the Ottoman power\r\nwas on the verge of ruin, and that another effort would suffice to bring\r\nabout its complete overthrow. The representations of Pope Eugenius IV.\r\nand his legate persuaded Ladislas, against the advice of Hunyadi, to\r\nrepudiate the treaty of Szegedin and to renew the war. The Hungarian\r\narmy crossed the Danube into Bulgaria, marched to the coast of the Black\r\nSea, and captured the important town of Varna. But Amurath had been\r\nroused from his retirement by the news of this act of Christian\r\ntreachery. Hastily collecting his troops, he advanced to Varna. In the\r\nbattle which ensued the invaders were scattered to the winds, and\r\nLadislas was slain (November 10, 1444). Servia and Bosnia were once more\r\nreduced to submission; and although Hunyadi tried to renew the struggle\r\nin 1448, he was defeated and taken prisoner in the second battle of\r\nKossova.\r\n\r\nAmurath had retired for the second time to Magnesia after the victory of\r\nVarna, but he was recalled by the outbreak of disorders which Mohammed\r\nwas unable to quell, and he continued to rule till his death in 1451.\r\nDuring his last years he was busied with a rising in Albania, headed by\r\nGeorge Castriot, or Scanderbeg, as the Turks [Sidenote: Scanderbeg in\r\nAlbania.] called him. This famous patriot had been trained in the\r\nTurkish service, and thoroughly understood the strength and the weakness\r\nof their tactics. Collecting round him a band of hardy mountaineers, he\r\navoided all conflicts in the open ground; and, aided by the difficult\r\ncharacter of the country, maintained a harassing guerilla warfare for\r\nmore than twenty years. But though he caused great annoyance to his\r\nenemies, he was not strong enough to divert them from the career of\r\nsuccessful aggression which has given to a prince, who had twice shown\r\nan apparent incapacity for government, the name of Mohammed the\r\nConqueror.\r\n\r\nMohammed II. ascended the throne with the firm determination to reduce\r\nthe tributary states into complete subjection, and to begin the work\r\nwith the Greek Empire. The year 1452 was spent in open preparation\r\n[Sidenote: Mohammed II. takes Constantinople.] for the siege of\r\nConstantinople. A fort was built upon the Bosphorus, troops and stores\r\nwere collected from all parts of the Turkish dominions, and foreign\r\nengineers were employed to construct larger cannon than had ever yet\r\nbeen employed in warfare. Constantine, who had succeeded his brother\r\nJohn in 1448, was fully aware of the danger which threatened his\r\ncapital. To remove any difficulties with the western powers he confirmed\r\nthe acts of the Council of Florence, and the union of the Churches was\r\nformally celebrated in St. Sophia. The bigoted Greeks looked on in\r\nsullen indignation, and resolved to do nothing for a prince who thus\r\npaltered with heresy. And Latin Christendom was not prepared to do\r\nanything in return for this tardy acceptance of its creed. France and\r\nEngland were exhausted by their long struggle, which was just ending in\r\nthe loss of the English possessions on the mainland; Philip of Burgundy\r\nwas absorbed in the extension of his rule in the Netherlands; Germany\r\nwas hopelessly distracted; and Frederick III., the weakest of emperors,\r\nwas unable to govern even his own hereditary provinces. In the eastern\r\nstates the disputes that had gathered round the succession of Ladislas\r\nPostumus distracted attention from vital interests in the distant Balkan\r\npeninsula. The only peoples who could give any aid to the Greeks were\r\nthe Venetians, Genoese, and Catalans, whose trade with the Levant\r\nimpelled them to do all in their power to maintain the feeble ramparts\r\nof Christianity against the Turks; and their forces, scanty as they were\r\nin proportion to the work to be performed, provided the only efficient\r\ngarrison for the city of the eastern Cæsars. In the spring of 1453 the\r\ngreat siege began. The first general assault was repulsed; and a Genoese\r\nsquadron, by superior weight and seamanship, forced its way through the\r\nimmense Turkish flotilla which attempted to exclude the arrival of\r\nsupplies and reinforcements by sea. But this was the last success of the\r\ndefenders, whose limited numbers had to hold five miles of\r\nfortifications against an overwhelming attack. On the 29th of May the\r\nlast assault was ordered, and after a desperate struggle for two hours\r\nthe Janissaries forced an entrance through a great breach which the\r\nartillery had made in the wall. The Emperor Constantine, whose heroism\r\ndid something to redeem the cowardly incapacity of his predecessors,\r\nfell at the head of the defenders of his capital. The mass of the Greeks\r\ndid nothing to resist the advance of the victorious assailants, and\r\nMohammed II. made a triumphal progress to the Church of St. Sophia,\r\nwhich witnessed on that day the first celebration of the worship of the\r\nProphet. The measures of the conqueror were marked by consummate wisdom.\r\nTo conciliate the bigotry of the natives, which had signally contributed\r\nto his victory, and to interpose a permanent barrier between his new\r\nsubjects and western Christendom, Mohammed proclaimed himself the\r\nprotector of the Greek Church, and allowed the installation of a new\r\nPatriarch, whose gratitude should take the form of servility to his\r\nMussulman patron. To remove the disastrous results of the siege,\r\nMohammed set himself to restore the buildings of the city, and to\r\nencourage the immigration of settlers from all parts of his dominions.\r\nBefore the end of his reign Constantinople was more populous and more\r\nflourishing than it had been at any time under the rule of the\r\nPalæologi.\r\n\r\nThe European powers were aghast when the news arrived that\r\nConstantinople had fallen; but as they had been impotent to save the\r\ncity, they were still more unable to attempt its recovery with any\r\nprospect of success. This was fully recognised by those states which\r\nwere most immediately concerned. The Venetians and Genoese continued\r\ntheir inveterate rivalry in the haste with which they made terms with\r\nthe conqueror, and purchased the retention of their trading privileges\r\nand of their possessions in the east by the payment of tribute. The two\r\nbrothers of Constantine, Demetrius and Thomas, who had established\r\nthemselves as petty princes at Patras and Mistra in the Morea, obtained\r\ntemporary recognition upon similar terms, and even received Turkish aid\r\nto put down a rebellion among their subjects. Leaving these self-seeking\r\nvassals in their humiliating dependence, Mohammed turned his arms to the\r\nsubjection of the tributary states in the [Sidenote: Conquest of Servia,\r\nWallachia, and Bosnia.] north. In 1455 he advanced through Servia,\r\nexpelled its king, and in the next year laid siege to Belgrade. Here he\r\nmet with his first and most serious reverse. The crusading army raised\r\nby Hunyadi and Capistrano not only relieved the fortress, but drove the\r\nsultan and his shattered army in disorderly flight to Sofia (see p.\r\n412). This signal triumph saved Hungary and eastern Germany from serious\r\ndanger for eighty years, but it failed to effect the liberation of the\r\nBalkan states. The Hungarian hero died on the scene of his greatest\r\nexploit; and the subsequent death of Ladislas Postumus, and the\r\ndifficulties attending the succession, distracted the attention of\r\nHungary from the eastern war. Mohammed II. returned to the attack with\r\nrenewed vigour, and in 1457 and 1458 Servia was again overrun and made a\r\nprovince of the Ottoman dominions. For the next three years Mohammed was\r\nengaged with war in Albania and in Greece, but in 1462 he again turned\r\nnorthwards and completed his work by the annexation of Wallachia (1462)\r\nand of Bosnia (1464).\r\n\r\nThe incompetence of the two surviving Palæologi, Thomas and Demetrius,\r\nand their incessant quarrels with each other, created such anarchy in\r\nthe Morea that intervention [Sidenote: Conquest of Greece.] was almost\r\nforced upon the Turks. At first a few garrisons were sent to the chief\r\ncities for the enforcement of order, but in 1460 an army was despatched\r\nto take more stringent measures. Resistance was hopeless. Demetrius was\r\ntaken prisoner and conveyed to Asia Minor, where a small territory was\r\nassigned to him rather as a place of exile than as a principality.\r\nThomas fled in a Venetian galley to Corfu, and thence made his way to\r\nRome. By the end of the year the whole of the peninsula, with the\r\nexception of a few harbours which were held by the Venetians, was in\r\nTurkish occupation. At the same time, the Turks were also active to the\r\nnorth of the isthmus of Corinth. The last duke of Athens was put to\r\ndeath by the bowstring; and his duchy, with the other Frankish\r\nprincipalities which had survived since the partition of Greece among\r\nthe Crusaders, was annexed by the Turks. In the Ægean the conquest of\r\nthe islands was undertaken by a Turkish fleet, and was completed in 1462\r\nby the capture of Lesbos. Only Rhodes continued to make good its\r\nresistance under the Knights of St. John.\r\n\r\nThe annexation of Greece constituted a serious danger to the Venetians,\r\nwho now held the only considerable possessions in the east which were\r\nleft under Christian rule. So far they had gained rather than lost by\r\nthe fall of Constantinople, because their treaty with Mohammed in 1454\r\nhad given them greater advantages over the Genoese than they could have\r\nextorted from the Palæologi, who had usually favoured their rivals. But\r\na series of significant events convinced them that the sultan was not\r\nlikely to observe the treaty any longer than his interest impelled him.\r\nWhile he was still confronted with serious problems in the north and the\r\nsouth, he had good reason for desiring to pacify Venice. But his\r\nsuccessive conquests had removed these difficulties from his way, and\r\nthere was no longer any substantial reason for allowing the Venetian\r\ndominions to escape the fate that had attended the other tributary\r\nstates. There had always been a party in Venice which had opposed the\r\n[Sidenote: War with Venice.] policy expressed in the treaty of 1454; and\r\nthe obvious approach of danger, heralded by the fall of Lesbos, enabled\r\nthis party to gain the upper hand in 1463. It is needless to trace the\r\nhistory of the war, which has been already alluded to in connection with\r\nthe history of Venice (see Chapter XII.). On the whole, it was\r\ncreditable to the capacity and the resolution of the great maritime\r\nrepublic; and though the Venetians could not prevent the loss of\r\nNegropont and the conquest of Albania, which had been left under their\r\nprotection on the death of Scanderbeg, they obtained better terms than\r\nwere given to any other opponent of Mohammed. By the treaty of\r\nConstantinople in 1479 the Turks obtained Albania and the islands of\r\nNegropont and Lemnos, but Venice was able to keep her possessions in the\r\nMorea and some of her trading privileges in the Levant on payment of\r\nincreased tribute. The Venetian quarter in Constantinople was restored\r\nunder the administration of a bailiff appointed by the Republic.\r\n\r\nThe conquests of Mohammed II. were not confined to Greece and the Balkan\r\npeninsula. In Asia Minor he extinguished [Sidenote: Other conquests of\r\nMohammed II.] the independence of the feeble empire of Trebizond (1461),\r\nwhich had been allowed to remain in harmless obscurity under a branch of\r\nthe Comneni ever since their expulsion from Constantinople in 1204. He\r\nalso completed the subjection of the princes of Caramania, the most\r\ninveterate opponents of the Ottoman ascendency. To the north of the\r\nBlack Sea he extorted tribute from the Tartars of the Crimea, and ruined\r\nthe Genoese by depriving them of their valuable establishments at Kaffa\r\nand Azof. In 1480 he undertook an enterprise which made almost more\r\nsensation in Europe than the siege of Constantinople. A Turkish force\r\nlanded on the coast of Apulia and took possession of Otranto. For the\r\nmoment men believed that the conqueror of the eastern empire would\r\ncomplete his fatal work by the capture of Rome, the capital of the west.\r\nBut the dreadful anticipation was never realised. The death of Mohammed\r\nin [Sidenote: Mohammed’s death, 1481.] 1481 led to the recall of the\r\ngarrison from Otranto. Under his successor Bajazet II., the only one of\r\nthe early Ottoman rulers who did not display conspicuous courage and\r\nability, the progress of the Turkish arms was stayed for a generation,\r\nto be resumed again under Selim I., the conqueror of Egypt, and under\r\nthe great Suleiman, who at last overcame the obstacle offered by\r\nBelgrade, and added to his dominions the greater part of Hungary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n                        THE RENAISSANCE IN ITALY\r\n\r\n\r\n    Some differences between mediæval and modern history—The period of\r\n    the Renaissance is the transition between the two periods—The\r\n    Renaissance in its wider and in its narrower sense—Prominence of\r\n    Italy in the Renaissance—The revival of letters—Dante, Petrarch, and\r\n    Boccaccio—The age of collectors—The age of criticism—The revival of\r\n    art—(1) Painting—(2) Sculpture—(3) Architecture—Humanism and the\r\n    Reformation—The impulse given to education.\r\n\r\nThe division of history into periods is always arbitrary, and always, if\r\ntoo rigidly interpreted, misleading. Yet some sort of division is not\r\nonly convenient, but almost [Sidenote: Mediæval and modern history.]\r\nnecessary, and the distinction between mediæval and modern history is as\r\nclearly marked as any distinction of the kind can be. It is, of course,\r\nimpossible to fix upon any date, and to say that here the Middle Ages\r\ncome to an end and modern times begin, just as it is impossible to say\r\nthat on a given day in the year winter ends and spring begins. The\r\nchanges in history, as in the seasons, are gradual, and not sudden.\r\nBetween the great historic epochs there is a period of transition in\r\nwhich the changes which mark them off from each other are slowly\r\ndeveloping, sometimes advancing, sometimes apparently receding, but\r\nultimately, by a gradual evolutionary process, reaching completion. And\r\nanother word of caution is necessary. It must be borne in mind that the\r\nMiddle Ages—the period which follows the disruption of the Roman Empire\r\nby the immigration of the German peoples, and ends with the formation of\r\nthe great national states which still exist—do not constitute a complete\r\nhomogeneous and stationary epoch. Social and political changes were not\r\nperhaps quite as rapid before the fifteenth century as they have been\r\nsince the Reformation, but changes were constantly taking place. A\r\ngeneralisation about the eighth century cannot be applied without\r\nserious modifications to the eleventh or the twelfth. All attempts to\r\nestimate the Middle Ages as a whole can only be extremely superficial\r\nand general.\r\n\r\nIt follows that it is impossible to give any adequate account of the\r\ndifferences between mediæval and modern history in a few perfunctory\r\nsentences or paragraphs. The [Sidenote: Differences between the two\r\nperiods.] differences are real and substantial, but they must be felt\r\nrather than expressed, and can only be properly and usefully\r\ncomprehended by a prolonged study of the past. There is, it may be said,\r\na difference of historical atmosphere, to which some historians, eager\r\nabove measure to find comparisons and parallels, have never become\r\nacclimatised, in spite of great learning and research. The often-quoted\r\nphrase that ‘history is past politics’ has been responsible for a woful\r\nnumber of anachronisms. For the historical student imagination, the\r\npower of projecting himself by a sort of instinct into the conditions\r\nand life of the past, is almost as necessary a quality as painstaking\r\nindustry. And imagination is rather fettered than assisted by the\r\nattempt to express what it sees, in precise and formal language. For the\r\nimmediate purpose of this chapter it will be better to abandon all\r\nattempt at minute precision or completeness of analysis, and to be\r\ncontent with pointing out three salient characteristics of the Middle\r\nAges, which the modern reader should grasp at the outset. These may\r\nserve to guide him to the appreciation of other and deeper distinctions\r\nbetween that period and the more familiar times that have followed it.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the modern conception of the state as a nation was\r\nvery imperfectly grasped in the Middle Ages. The modern nations, such as\r\nthe French, English, Spaniards, and others, were in process of\r\nformation, but they only became fully conscious of their distinct\r\ncorporate unity at the end of the period. Mediæval theorists—guided by\r\nthe traditions of the Roman Empire, as modified by the influences of\r\nChristianity—regarded Christendom as a single state under two heads—the\r\nPope and the Emperor—who held ecclesiastical and secular authority as\r\ndelegates of the Deity. The best concrete illustration of this\r\nconception of unity is offered by the Crusades, which ended in failure,\r\npartly on account of the distance of the scene of action, but mainly\r\nbecause the unity of Christendom was theoretical rather than real.\r\nInternally western Christendom was organised under what is called the\r\nFeudal System, a semi-agricultural and semi-military organisation, in\r\nwhich the mutual rights and duties of classes to each other were\r\nregulated by the tenure of land, while industry, the most potent of\r\nmodern forces, had no place in it. Allied with feudalism was the\r\nfantastic body of rules and customs known as Chivalry. Chivalry was as\r\nessentially non-national as Christianity itself. A French and a German\r\nknight had more in common with each other than either had with a French\r\nor German citizen or peasant.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the social unit in the Middle Ages was not what it\r\nis now, the individual man, but a corporation; either the feudal unit\r\nwhich in England is called the manor, or the municipal commune, or\r\nwithin the commune the guild. There was no scope for the activity of the\r\nindividual by himself. The only way in which an able and ambitious man\r\ncould hope to rise from obscurity to eminence was by entering the\r\ngreatest of all corporations—the Church.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the mediæval period was a period of ignorance. Learning and\r\neducation were for the most part monopolised by the clergy, and in their\r\nhands were bound down by prescription and by ecclesiastical authority.\r\nEverybody knows with what ill-will the Church regarded freedom of\r\ninquiry and scientific research: the charge of heresy was always ready\r\nto be brought against a Roger Bacon or a Galileo. Moreover, quite apart\r\nfrom the influence of the Church, learning and literature were withheld\r\nfrom the mass of the people by their expense. Printing was unknown, and\r\npaper was only introduced at the very end of the period. Parchment was\r\nso expensive that many of the manuscripts of ancient writers were erased\r\nin order to make room for monkish chronicles or service-books. Moreover,\r\nsuch literature as existed was in Latin, and that in itself was\r\nsufficient to close it alike to nobles, burghers, and peasants, most of\r\nwhom were unable to read or write even their native tongue. And\r\nignorance was, as usual, accompanied by gross superstition. To realise\r\nthis it is only necessary to peruse the lists of marvels with which the\r\nmediæval chroniclers fill their pages, or to study the working of the\r\njudicial system in which the guilt or innocence of an accused person was\r\ndecided by the ordeal.\r\n\r\nThe period of the Renaissance, in its proper and most comprehensive\r\nmeaning, may be regarded as the age in which the [Sidenote: The\r\nRenaissance.] social and political system of the Middle Ages came to an\r\nend, in which mediæval restrictions upon liberty of thought and inquiry\r\nwere abolished. It may be said to begin in the thirteenth century, to be\r\nin full progress during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and to\r\nbe continued in an altered form in the religious struggles of the\r\nsixteenth century. It is, in fact, the period covered by the present\r\nvolume. To this great epoch of transition, ‘The Close of the Middle\r\nAges,’ belong a number of changes of the first magnitude: the decline of\r\nthe Empire and the Papacy, and of the ideas and traditions with which\r\nthey were connected; the growth and the hardening into shape of the\r\nFrench, Spanish, and English nations; the rise of national literatures\r\nand of the conception of national churches; the breaking up of feudalism\r\nand chivalry by the growing importance of industry; the overthrow of\r\naristocratic and ecclesiastical predominance by the rise of the people\r\nto political influence; the growth of strong territorial monarchies\r\nbased upon popular support, though in every country except England the\r\nmonarchy kicked away its support as soon as it was no longer needed.\r\nWith these changes must be coupled the results of the great inventions\r\nand discoveries of the age: the employment of the compass and the\r\nastrolabe, and the consequent development of maritime adventure, which\r\nled to the finding of a new way to India and a new world across the\r\nAtlantic, and so to an enormous extension of knowledge and a complete\r\nalteration of the great trade-routes of the world; the discovery of\r\ngunpowder, and the revolution which it effected not only in the art of\r\nwar, but also in the organisation of society, which in the Middle Ages\r\nwas inextricably bound up with the military system; the invention of\r\nprinting, followed by a vast extension and popularisation of literature\r\nand knowledge; and, finally, the great astronomical discovery of\r\nCopernicus, which overthrew the old belief in the stability and central\r\nposition of the earth, and dealt a fatal blow to the vast structure of\r\nsuperstition which had been erected upon that belief.\r\n\r\nAll these vast changes belong to the Renaissance; they are all part of\r\nthe development which has been aptly called a new birth; no one of them\r\ncan be fully appreciated apart from the rest. Some of them have been\r\nalluded to in the preceding pages of this volume; all of them merit the\r\nmost careful consideration; their mere enumeration is enough to show\r\ntheir immense importance. But a single chapter can only serve as a sort\r\nof sign-post, and the dictates of prudence compel a limitation of\r\nattention to two movements with which the name of the Renaissance has\r\nbeen pre-eminently and sometimes exclusively associated—the revival of\r\nletters and the revival of art. And it is to the Renaissance in this\r\nnarrower sense that Italy rendered its most active and enduring\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nThe revival of literature and art was peculiarly the work of Italy. It\r\nis not merely that the Italians began the work and that other nations\r\ncarried it on to completion. The recovery of ancient literature and art\r\nand the application of the lessons to be learned from them to\r\ncontemporary needs were both begun and completed in Italy. It was only\r\nafter this completion [Sidenote: Prominence of Italy in the\r\nRenaissance.] that the other countries came in to learn the lessons\r\nwhich Italy was able and ready to teach them. It is true that the spirit\r\ninspired by this teaching was applied by the other nations with great\r\nresults to the reform of religion, to the extension of geographical\r\nknowledge, and to new discoveries in the realms of science. But this\r\nmust not blind us to the magnitude and completeness of the task\r\naccomplished by Italy single-handed; nor must it be forgotten that, in\r\nthe departments of painting and sculpture at any rate, the actual\r\nachievements of the Italians have never been surpassed by their pupils.\r\n\r\nNor is there anything surprising in the prominence of the part played by\r\nItaly in the intellectual Renaissance. Although Italy, like the other\r\nprovinces of Rome, fell a victim to the barbarian invaders, yet the\r\ntradition of supremacy which Roman victories had created was not wholly\r\ndestroyed, and it was revived with the growing authority of the Papacy\r\nduring the Middle Ages. Moreover, the geographical position of Italy was\r\nof immense importance in an age when the Mediterranean was still the\r\ncentre of the world’s commerce. Trade and manufactures brought wealth to\r\nthe great civic communities of Italy, to Florence, Venice, and Genoa,\r\nand wealth has rarely failed to create a sense of self-importance, a\r\nconsciousness of power and a desire for freedom, while at the same time\r\nit supplies the leisure requisite for prolonged intellectual exertion.\r\nBut it may be thought—after what has been said before—that the Church,\r\nhaving its central seat and authority in Italy, would be strong enough\r\nto suppress independence of thought and inquiry. But to this suggestion\r\ntwo answers may be made. It is an old saying that familiarity breeds\r\ncontempt. The Italians had no objection to the presence of the Papacy in\r\ntheir midst. On the contrary, it flattered their pride to think that\r\nRome was still the head of a great spiritual empire, as it had once been\r\nof a vast territorial power. Moreover, the tribute of other states was\r\npoured into Italy by way of the papal coffers; and Italians had, if not\r\na monopoly, at any rate a preponderant share in the cardinalate and\r\nother lucrative offices in the Church. But at the same time the Italians\r\nby no means felt the same superstitious awe and reverence of the Church\r\nand Papacy as prevailed in more distant countries. The ecclesiastical\r\nthunders of excommunication and interdict were much less dreaded by\r\npeople who could see the working of the machinery which could produce\r\nsuch awful sounds. The abuses of the papal court, which ultimately\r\nproduced the indignant revolt of the greater part of northern Europe,\r\nwere so familiar to the Italians that they were hardly scandalised by\r\nthem. Thus though the Italians, as a whole, showed little zeal for\r\nreligious reform, they were, at any rate the wealthier classes, usually\r\nfree from superstition and unlikely to tolerate ecclesiastical\r\ndespotism.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be noted that the popes in Italy did not always pursue a\r\npolicy of enlightened devotion to their spiritual interests. These\r\ninterests were, or were [Sidenote: The Papacy and the Renaissance.]\r\nthought to be at a later time, opposed to freedom of thought, and\r\ntherefore to such an advance in literature and art as would favour such\r\nfreedom. But the popes were secular princes as well as heads of the\r\nChurch. The central provinces of Italy constituted a considerable\r\ntemporal principality; and it frequently happened that the interests of\r\nthis principality by no means coincided with the interests of Roman\r\nCatholicism throughout Europe. The same motives which made so many\r\nItalian princes the munificent patrons of literature and art appealed to\r\nthe popes also in their secular capacity. They, too, desired to have a\r\nmagnificent and learned court; they were ambitious to compete with the\r\nMedici of Florence and with the kings of Naples; they wished to have\r\ntheir palaces and their churches built and adorned by the most eminent\r\nartists of their time; they were eager that their praises should be\r\nhanded down to posterity by men whose genius would secure immortality to\r\ntheir patrons as well as to themselves. Thus individual popes, such as\r\nNicolas V. and Leo X., were the industrious furtherers of the\r\nRenaissance; and they unconsciously stimulated a movement which was\r\ndestined to overthrow the magnificent structure of ecclesiastical\r\nautocracy which had been built up by their great predecessors from\r\nGregory VII. to Innocent III. Such shortsightedness has many parallels\r\nin history. It is easy to recall how the French nobles in the eighteenth\r\ncentury flirted with a philosophy which preached the doctrine of popular\r\nrights and liberties; and how the French monarchy gave practical aid to\r\na rebellion which secured such rights and liberties in North America,\r\nthus encouraging the advance of that Revolution which for a time swept\r\nthe French monarchy and the French nobility from the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nTurning now to a rapid survey of the actual achievements of Italy, we\r\nfind that the revival of literature and art was not only a stimulus to\r\nintellectual progress and a [Sidenote: The Revival of letters.]\r\ndeathblow to ignorance and superstition; it also marks a great step in\r\nthe freedom of the individual from mediæval restrictions. In art, and\r\nstill more in literature, the individual found a career by which he\r\ncould exercise his highest talents, and in which he could attain a\r\npersonal eminence hitherto impossible. Dante, who stands on the\r\nthreshold of the Renaissance, was the first great man in the Middle Ages\r\nwho stood out by himself, unconnected with any corporate body or\r\ninstitution. He used to boast exultingly that he was his own party. The\r\n_Divine Comedy_ gave literary form to the first of the new living\r\nlanguages of Europe. For Italy the work was almost too great; it has\r\nleft too weighty an impression upon his fellow-countrymen. To this day\r\nit is the highest ambition of an Italian writer to use the language of\r\nDante, and he must have frequent recourse to a dictionary to make sure\r\nthat his words were really current in the thirteenth century. It is\r\nnever wholesome to have too marked a distinction between the language of\r\nliterature and that of ordinary life, and this servile habit of looking\r\nback has checked the growth of a really great Italian literature in\r\nlater times. But Dante, with all his greatness, was not really imbued\r\nwith the modern spirit. He had not emancipated himself from the ideas of\r\nhis time, though he had raised himself above them. In his _De Monarchia_\r\nhe willingly surrendered himself to the scholastic philosophy, and made\r\na vigorous effort to defend the already effete and worthless theory of a\r\nuniversal empire. Dante stands on the threshold of the Renaissance, but\r\nhe is rather the last giant of the Middle Ages than the herald of a new\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\nDante was followed by Petrarch, whose sonnets have influenced literary\r\nform in all countries, while his passionate devotion to the literature\r\nand liberty of the ancients makes him the first of Italian humanists. A\r\ncontemporary of Petrarch was a man of still greater original genius,\r\nGiovanni Boccaccio. Like Petrarch, Boccaccio was a great lover and\r\nstudent of ancient literature, and he did much to introduce the study of\r\nGreek into Italy. But it is as the author of the _Decameron_ that he is\r\nentitled to the greatest fame. In this collection of stories he\r\ndisplayed a contempt for superstition and a delight in life which were\r\nalien to the spirit of the Middle Ages. Chaucer borrowed many plots of\r\nthe _Canterbury Tales_ from the _Decameron_; and through Chaucer and\r\nother writers Boccaccio has influenced the whole of later English\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nThese three great men were followed by a crowd of collectors, men who\r\ntravelled throughout Europe and even [Sidenote: The age of collection.]\r\nbeyond it in search of manuscripts of ancient authors. It is almost\r\nimpossible nowadays to appreciate the extraordinary ardour with which\r\nthe search was carried on. In some cases the greed for these new and\r\nvaluable possessions tempted men into actions which in a less worthy\r\ncause would have merited the name of fraud. The greatest of these\r\ncollectors, who really performed an invaluable service to the world with\r\nmarvellous industry and success, were Poggio Bracciolini, Francesco\r\nFilelfo, and Niccolo Niccoli, the founder of the library of St. Mark in\r\nFlorence. Their most bountiful patrons were Cosimo de’ Medici, the\r\n‘father of his country,’ and Pope Nicolas V. During this period, which\r\nis roughly the first half of the fifteenth century, the Italian language\r\nseemed likely to fall into oblivion. The only great writers in Italy\r\nwere Poggio and Æneas Sylvius, and they both wrote solely in Latin. That\r\nItalian did not go wholly out of fashion was due, in the first place, to\r\nthe influence of the Medici in Florence. One great object of their\r\nambition was to attract the most learned men of the day to their court.\r\nBut their anomalous position as despots masquerading in republican robes\r\ncompelled them to appeal to popular favour. Hence even their studies had\r\nto some extent to be regulated so as to please the people. The\r\nmagnificent Lorenzo himself set an example by writing the famous\r\n‘carnival songs’ to be sung at popular festivals. These songs have a\r\nplace of their own in the history of Italian literature; but they are of\r\nspecial importance as showing how a great prince, in the midst of Greek\r\nand Latin studies, could find time to cultivate the language of the\r\npeople. The finest Italian poem of the century is the _Giostra_ of\r\nPolitiano, who was not only an eminent scholar, but also a courtier and\r\na favourite companion of Lorenzo de’ Medici.\r\n\r\nIn classical studies the second part of the fifteenth century was not so\r\nmuch an age of collection as an age of criticism. [Sidenote: The age of\r\ncriticism.] Men set themselves to read and interpret the treasures which\r\nhad been already brought together, and they were insensibly led to apply\r\nthe teaching of ancient writings to the circumstances and problems of\r\ntheir own time. Prominent among the scholars who gave to the world the\r\nfruits of their researches were Lorenzo Valla in Rome and Naples, and\r\nFicino and Politiano in Florence. It is impossible to over-estimate the\r\nsolvent influence of these studies upon human thought. Much of the\r\nscholastic philosophy which had been based upon a corrupt translation of\r\nAristotle from the Arabic gave way at once before a study of the\r\nphilosopher’s original text. All kinds of delusions and superstitious\r\nbeliefs were overturned by the new spirit of inquiry. Lorenzo Valla\r\npublished a treatise to prove that the pretended Donation of\r\nConstantine, upon which the popes had professed to base their claim to\r\ntemporal sovereignty, was a forgery. Valla was at this time in the\r\nservice of Alfonso the Magnanimous of Naples, who had quarrelled with\r\nthe Pope. Under his protection Valla went on to attack the whole\r\necclesiastical system, and especially the moral decline of monasticism.\r\nThese may serve as illustrations of the influence exerted by the new\r\nculture. In fact, so great was the energy displayed in the work of\r\ndestruction, that it seemed probable that all the old religious bonds\r\nwould be broken before anything had been found to take their place. If\r\nItaly had stood alone, this might have been the case. But by this time\r\nthe new learning had begun to spread to other countries. The more sober\r\ntemperament of the Germans revolted against the extravagances of many of\r\nthe Italian scholars. Luther and Reuchlin were impelled by the critical\r\nspirit of the age to revolt against the mediæval system, but they were\r\nnot content with mere negation, and their revolt, constructive as well\r\nas destructive, has been called the Reformation.\r\n\r\nIf we can trace to the Italians the origin of modern literature, we may\r\nwith still greater confidence call them the creators of modern art, or\r\nat any rate of the arts [Sidenote: The revival of art.] of painting and\r\nsculpture. Architecture was the only form of art which did not fall into\r\ndecay during the Middle Ages, and in which the northern peoples may\r\nclaim at least equality with the people of Italy. But in painting and\r\nsculpture the Italians can claim not only that they are entitled to all\r\nthe glories of their revival, but also that they brought these arts to\r\ntheir highest perfection. This is far more than can be said of their\r\nservices to literature.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages painting was so bound down by fixed [Sidenote: 1.\r\nPainting.] and arbitrary rules that it hardly deserved the name of an\r\nart. It was employed only for religious purposes, and it was forced to\r\nconform to the dominant religious spirit. Custom and tradition regulated\r\nnot only the subject and its treatment, but even the very colours to be\r\nemployed. Any departure from these recognised rules, if it had been\r\npossible, would have been regarded as impious. The altar-pieces of\r\nmediæval churches were covered with stiff and lifeless representations\r\nof madonnas and saints. These had a conventional value, and no artistic\r\nstandard was dreamt of. There were many pictures, but no artists. The\r\nindividual, as was so often the case in the Middle Ages, was repressed\r\nand kept down by the society of which he was perforce a member. Anybody\r\ncan obtain a concrete illustration of the differences in painting\r\nbetween the Middle Ages and modern times, who can compare a picture of\r\nCimabue or any other contemporary artist with a picture by Titian. The\r\nRenaissance, which bridges over the gap between these artists, is the\r\nsteady though gradual assertion of the freedom of the individual from\r\nthe bondage of mediæval rules and traditions. The change may be traced\r\nin the increased love of nature, in the new reverence for and study of\r\nthe human figure, and in the improvement of artistic methods. The most\r\nimportant of the technical changes were the introduction of fresco for\r\nwall-pictures, the discovery of oil-colours, which is to be credited to\r\nthe Flemings, and the employment of copper-plate and woodcuts, which\r\nmade it possible to reproduce and disseminate great works of art. But\r\nstill more important than any change in method was the change in the\r\nvery spirit of art; for the old stereotyped forms were substituted\r\nimitations of the beautiful from Nature. The study of anatomy and\r\nperspective became necessary for a painter. Works of art ceased to be\r\nmechanical copies of a pattern prescribed by ecclesiastical authority;\r\nthey became an index to the mind of the free artist. The change marks a\r\ncomplete alteration in the motives of religion as well as of art.\r\nReligion ceased to be a superstitious reverence for something unearthly\r\nand inhuman; it was brought into closer relation with the ordinary life\r\nof men and women.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the Renaissance in painting is usually placed in the\r\nfourteenth century. At that time two great art cities, Florence and\r\nSiena, were especially prominent. The first great Florentine artist\r\nwhose name has been handed down to posterity is Cimabue. His Sienese\r\ncontemporary was Duccio. In their works we see the first conception of\r\nthe beauty of the human face and figure, though they were still bound\r\ndown to the old stiffness of composition and the prescribed distribution\r\nof colours. They were followed by a number of artists who have obtained\r\nlasting renown. In Florence Giotto, equally great as a painter,\r\nsculptor, and architect, founded a school which raised the whole\r\ncharacter of art, besides effecting a great improvement in technique.\r\nGiotto was the first to substitute dramatic painting for the stiff and\r\nlifeless representation of human figures which had hitherto been\r\nuniversal. With him may be coupled the name of Andrea Orcagna, Ambrogio\r\nLorenzetti, and Fra Angelico, though the last-named belongs\r\nchronologically to a somewhat later period. But of these men the same\r\nobservation may be made as of Dante in literature. They are rather the\r\ngreatest men of an age which is already passing away than the beginners\r\nof a new period. Giotto especially is the Dante of art. He and his\r\ncontemporaries sum up in a pictorial form the mediæval theories and\r\nconceptions of religion and of human life. To their representation they\r\ncontribute a vast improvement in manner and style, as did Dante in his\r\ngreat poem, but what they represent is essentially mediæval. In fact, if\r\nany one wished to see the Middle Ages before his eyes, he might be\r\nreferred to three great pictures of this period. The gloomy personal\r\nreligion, which weighed down the spirits of thoughtful men in the Middle\r\nAges, may be seen in Orcagna’s picture, ‘The Triumph of Death,’ in the\r\nCampo Santo of Pisa. On the other hand, the converse side of religious\r\nlife in the Middle Ages, the grand and awe-inspiring organisation of the\r\nChurch, is represented in ‘The Church Militant and Triumphant,’the work\r\nof Giotto’s pupils, in the Spanish Chapel of Santa Maria Novella in\r\nFlorence. And the stormy political life of a mediæval commune may be\r\nstudied in the frescoes of Ambrogio Lorenzetti, entitled ‘Civil\r\nGovernment,’ on the walls of the Palazzo Publico of Siena.\r\n\r\nIt is when we leave the school of Giotto and his pupils, and turn to the\r\nnext generation of painters in the fifteenth century, that we find the\r\nartistic change associated with the Renaissance in full progress.\r\nFlorence was still the most important city in the history of art. The\r\nfirst great painter in this transition period was Masaccio. His frescoes\r\nin the Brancacci Chapel of the Church of the Madonna del Carmine at\r\nFlorence may be taken as illustrating the next marked advance in\r\nindependence and artistic beauty from the days of Giotto. These works\r\nexercised great influence upon all later artists, and especially upon\r\nRaphael, who made them the subject of special study. Masaccio was\r\nfollowed by a large number of eminent painters, among whom may be named\r\nFilippo Lippi, in connection with whom Browning’s poem gives so vivid a\r\npicture of the artistic struggles of the early Renaissance, Sandro\r\nBotticelli, who was the first to introduce classical myths and\r\nallegories as alternative subjects with the old Biblical stories,\r\nFilippino Lippi, Domenico Ghirlandaio, and Luca Signorelli. The last is\r\nperhaps in some way the ablest, though by no means the most pleasing, of\r\nthe fifteenth century painters. In the boldness of his conceptions, in\r\nhis knowledge of anatomy, and in his contempt for arbitrary and\r\nmeaningless rules, he is not only the forerunner but the rival of\r\nMichael Angelo. But Florence, although the most important, was by no\r\nmeans the only city in which this artistic revolution was taking place.\r\nThe same sort of work was being done in Perugia by Pietro Perugino, the\r\ntutor of Raphael, in Padua by Andrea Mantegna, one of the greatest of\r\nfifteenth century painters, and, above all, in Venice by Giovanni and\r\nGentile Bellini and by Vittore Carpaccio. It was the work of these men,\r\nin addition to that of the Florentine and many other painters, which\r\nprepared the way for the supreme artists of the sixteenth\r\ncentury—Leonardo da Vinci, Michael Angelo, Raphael, Andrea del Sarto,\r\nGiorgione, Titian, and Tintoretto. These painters still devoted their\r\ntalents mainly to the illustration of religious subjects; but they\r\ntreated these subjects in a human and secular spirit. The religious and\r\ndevotional aspect was subordinated to the desire for artistic perfection\r\nof form and colour, and to the exciting of natural associations in the\r\nminds of men and women. There is nothing really irreligious in their\r\nart, though it shows a new way of regarding both art and religion. At\r\nthe same time, it is possible to discover in these artists of the\r\ncompleted Renaissance a certain relaxation of moral earnestness and\r\npurpose as compared with their predecessors; their very mastery of\r\ncolour and of drawing seems to mislead them; there is no longer the\r\nnoble struggle to express a lofty meaning in spite of difficulties and\r\ndrawbacks. It was the perception of these differences which led many\r\nthoughtful artists and art students, who formed what has been called the\r\npre-Raphaelite school, to devote themselves to the study of the earlier\r\nand less faultless painters of the fifteenth century, and somewhat to\r\nundervalue the more mature artists who had been the idols of previous\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nThe Renaissance marks almost a greater epoch in the history of sculpture\r\nthan in that of painting. In some [Sidenote: 2. Sculpture.] respects the\r\nchange which took place was the same. Great artists revolted against the\r\nprescribed forms of the Middle Ages, and produced works of greater\r\nbeauty and greater originality. But sculpture was more profoundly\r\ninfluenced than painting by the revived study of antiquity. The great\r\npainters of ancient Greece were mere names, their works had perished. It\r\nwas therefore only the classical spirit that influenced painting. Direct\r\nimitation was impossible. With sculpture it was otherwise. Greek and\r\nRoman statues were still in existence, and many that had been buried\r\nwere unearthed and welcomed with passionate reverence. In some of these\r\nstatues had been realised the utmost possible beauty of form and truth\r\nto nature that were possible in sculpture. It was impossible to surpass\r\nthem, and before long the passion for antiquity led to a servile\r\nimitation of the ancient originals. But the first enthusiasm did produce\r\na few great master-workers who rivalled the artists of Greece. The first\r\nto inaugurate the new epoch in the history of sculpture was Niccolo da\r\nPisano. A Greek sarcophagus, still preserved, had been brought to Pisa,\r\nand Niccolo was induced by its beauty to make a thorough study of Greek\r\nforms and methods. From this time he set himself to reconcile, as far as\r\nwas possible, the Greek love of beauty with the traditions of Christian\r\nart. He was followed in the next century by a number of great sculptors,\r\nmost of whom were Florentines. Among their names the most important are\r\nthose of Lorenzo Ghiberti, who carved the gates for the Baptistery in\r\nFlorence, which Michael Angelo declared worthy to be the gates of\r\nParadise; Luca della Robbia, whose chief works are reliefs in\r\nterra-cotta; Donatello, the sculptor of the famous figure of David; and\r\nAndrea Verrocchio, the modeller of the grand equestrian statue of\r\nBartolommeo Coleone, which stands near the Scuola di San Marco in\r\nVenice. After them came the great masters of Renaissance\r\nsculpture—Benvenuto Cellini and Michael Angelo. The Memoirs of the\r\nformer may be commended to any one who wishes to study the purely\r\nartistic temperament, uninfluenced by considerations of religion or\r\nmorality, which was produced in the later stages of the Renaissance.\r\nSculpture, it must be remembered, was more essentially non-religious and\r\npagan than painting. The beauty of the face was necessarily subordinate\r\nto beauty of figure. Thus the new religious impulse of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, which led to the Reformation in northern Europe and to the\r\ncounter-Reformation in the south, was in many ways alien or hostile to\r\nsculpture, and from this time the art tended to decline.\r\n\r\nIn architecture the Renaissance exerted an overwhelming and permanent\r\ninfluence, and here again Italy led the way, but it may be questioned\r\nwhether the influence resulted in unmixed gain. Architecture had never\r\nbeen a lost art, as painting and sculpture had been. Nor was classical\r\ninfluence a new thing, for the Romanesque style of the early Middle Ages\r\nhad been based upon ancient models. Beyond the Alps the early Romanesque\r\nbuildings had been followed by the great Gothic churches and cathedrals\r\nwhich remain the great monument of the religious zeal of the Germanic\r\npeoples in the later Middle Ages. Gothic architecture had been\r\nintroduced into Italy by German builders in the later part of the\r\nthirteenth century. But Italian Gothic was a different style of\r\narchitecture from that which prevailed in the northern countries. From\r\nthe first it had been modified by national usages and by considerations\r\nof climate. The great Gothic churches of Italy are the cathedrals of\r\nOrvieto and Siena, and they are very different from the Gothic\r\ncathedrals of Germany, France, and England. The excessive height in\r\nproportion to the width and length, the enormous arches, and the flying\r\nbuttresses are absent in Italy. Italy never departed altogether from the\r\nclassical models.\r\n\r\nThe Renaissance in architecture, as in sculpture, was the result of the\r\nrevival of classical studies; and its formal changes [Sidenote: 3.\r\nArchitecture.] are to be seen in the return, first to the round arch of\r\nthe Romanesque period, and later, in the use of the flat top or lintel\r\nof the Greeks and Romans. The great building of the early or\r\ntransitional Renaissance is the Cathedral of Florence, with its\r\nmagnificent dome, the work of Filippo Brunellesco, and the progress of\r\nthe movement, may be traced in St. Peter’s in Rome, designed by\r\nBramante, but modified and completed after his death, and finally in the\r\npalaces built by Palladio in Vicenza and Verona. Thus only the beginning\r\nof the architectural Renaissance belongs properly to the period covered\r\nin this volume, whereas much more progress had been made in painting and\r\nsculpture by the end of the fifteenth century. And its ultimate results\r\nwere in many ways alien to the true spirit of the real Renaissance.\r\nGothic architecture, whatever its defects, had given great scope for\r\noriginality. After the main design had been agreed upon, the completion\r\nof details had been left in great measure to the ability and imagination\r\nof the individual workmen. But the architecture of the later Renaissance\r\nlaid supreme stress upon symmetry and uniformity. Thus the workmen could\r\nno longer be allowed to be original. Every detail, as well as the\r\ncentral design, had to be fixed from the outset. The result was\r\nmagnificent and imposing, but it was purchased at the sacrifice of\r\noriginality and imagination. When the first vigour of the intellectual\r\nrevival was spent, there was a marked decline in architecture as in\r\nsculpture, because in both the imitative faculty was cultivated rather\r\nthan the power of independent creation.\r\n\r\nThe Renaissance, like all great historic movements, contained good and\r\nevil intermingled together. Its two prominent [Sidenote: Humanism and\r\nthe Reformation.] directions, especially in its earlier period, were the\r\nrevival of classical influences in literature and art, and the\r\nvindication of originality of thought and of individual freedom. Both\r\nhad their special dangers, and they only went together for a limited\r\ndistance. The first tended to degenerate into the slavish and mechanical\r\nimitation of ancient models; the second led in many cases to atheism, to\r\nlicence, to the chaos of pure negation. Nor were these the only evils.\r\nThe Renaissance spirit of free inquiry, when applied to religion, gave\r\nrise to the Reformation, and the religious Reformation hastened to turn\r\nagainst the spirit that had given it birth. Extreme Protestantism or\r\nPuritanism was in many ways diametrically opposed to humanism.\r\nSavonarola, who may be said to represent the Puritan spirit upon Italian\r\nsoil, urged his followers to make bonfires of their pictures, their\r\npersonal ornaments, and even of their books. The English Puritans\r\ndenounced the love of beauty in art as a carnal and misleading pleasure.\r\nThe Protestants, who owed their origin to the assertion of freedom of\r\nthought and worship, soon came to erect a rigid system of dogma and\r\nchurch government, which was fully as repressive and intolerant as that\r\nagainst which they had revolted. The persecution which they resisted\r\nwith such heroism impelled them, unfortunately, not to practise\r\ntoleration, but to become persecutors in their turn.\r\n\r\nThat the good results of the Renaissance were not entirely destroyed or\r\noverwhelmed either by the evils of the movement [Sidenote: Spread of\r\neducation.] itself or by the reaction provoked by those evils, is due to\r\nthe impulse which the Renaissance and the Reformation both gave to\r\neducation. In every country the introduction of the new learning and the\r\nreformed religion was followed by the creation of new schools and\r\nuniversities, and by the improvement of educational methods in the\r\ninstitutions which already existed. To the spread of education we owe\r\nthe greatest and most permanent result of the Renaissance, the union,\r\ninstead of the antagonism, of morality and culture. And this union has\r\nresulted in a higher morality than that inspired by compulsory beliefs\r\nand compulsory observances—the morality of the free mind and conscience\r\nof the individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                APPENDIX\r\n                          GENEALOGICAL TABLES\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A. The Succession in Bohemia. (See p. 15.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: B. The Succession in Tyrol. (See pp. 107 and 120.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: C. The House of Hapsburg.]\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The Hapsburg territories were divided between Albert III. and his\r\nbrother Leopold, the former taking Austria, and the latter all the rest.\r\nOf the sons of Leopold, Ernest succeeded to Styria and Carinthia,\r\nFrederick to Tyrol and the lands in Swabia. The Albertine line became\r\nextinct with the death of Ladislas Postumus, when Austria passed to\r\nFrederick III., and the latter’s son, Maximilian I., reunited all the\r\nterritories of the house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: D. The House of Wittelsbach.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: E. The House of Luxemburg.]\r\n\r\nNOTE.—Luxemburg was transferred by Elizabeth, daughter of John of\r\nGörlitz, to her husband’s nephew, Philip the Good of Burgundy, to the\r\nexclusion of her own nearest surviving relative, Ladislas Postumus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: F. The Later Capets in France.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: G. The House of Valois.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H. The Duchy and County of Burgundy.]\r\n\r\nNOTES.—The duchy and county were united by the marriage of Eudes IV.\r\nwith Jeanne, daughter of Philip V. of France (see p. 64). On the death\r\nof Philip de Rouvre the duchy fell to the crown, and was granted by John\r\nto his fourth son, Philip the Bold. The County, with Artois, passed to\r\nMargaret, widow of Lewis II. of Flanders: and her grand-daughter,\r\nanother Margaret, brought these provinces, together with Flanders,\r\nNevers, and Rethel, to the Valois dukes of Burgundy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I. The First House of Anjou in Naples and Hungary.]\r\n\r\nNOTES.—Charles I., called in by the popes, acquired both Naples and\r\nSicily, but lost the latter in the Sicilian Vespers, 1282 (see p. 25).\r\nJoanna I., in order to disinherit her nephew, afterwards Charles III.,\r\nadopted as her heir Louis of Anjou, who could claim a distant descent\r\nfrom Charles II. Louis obtained possession of Provence, but he and his\r\ndescendants carried on a long and unsuccessful struggle for the crown of\r\nNaples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: K. The Second House of Anjou in Naples.]\r\n\r\nNOTE.—Several members of the family made strenuous efforts to gain the\r\ncrown of Naples, but without any substantial success. Réné le Bon, who\r\nspent a long life in Provence, disinherited his grandson, Réné of\r\nLorraine, and left his possessions to his nephew, Charles of Maine, with\r\nremainder to the French crown. This enabled Louis XI. to annex Provence\r\nin 1481, and also gave rise to the claim upon Naples which was put\r\nforward by Charles VIII. in 1494.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: L.
