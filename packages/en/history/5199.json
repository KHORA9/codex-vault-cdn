After hearing of the Norwegian success\r\nI began to make preparations to start a last great journey—so that the\r\nfirst crossing of the last continent should be achieved by a British\r\nExpedition.\r\n\r\nWe failed in this object, but the story of our attempt is the subject\r\nfor the following pages, and I think that though failure in the actual\r\naccomplishment must be recorded, there are chapters in this book of\r\nhigh adventure, strenuous days, lonely nights, unique experiences, and,\r\nabove all, records of unflinching determination, supreme loyalty, and\r\ngenerous self-sacrifice on the part of my men which, even in these days\r\nthat have witnessed the sacrifices of nations and regardlessness of\r\nself on the part of individuals, still will be of interest to readers\r\nwho now turn gladly from the red horror of war and the strain of the\r\nlast five years to read, perhaps with more understanding minds, the\r\ntale of the White Warfare of the South. The struggles, the\r\ndisappointments, and the endurance of this small party of Britishers,\r\nhidden away for nearly two years in the fastnesses of the Polar ice,\r\nstriving to carry out the ordained task and ignorant of the crises\r\nthrough which the world was passing, make a story which is unique in\r\nthe history of Antarctic exploration.\r\n\r\nOwing to the loss of the _Endurance_ and the disaster to the _Aurora_,\r\ncertain documents relating mainly to the organization and preparation\r\nof the Expedition have been lost; but, anyhow, I had no intention of\r\npresenting a detailed account of the scheme of preparation, storing,\r\nand other necessary but, to the general reader, unimportant affairs, as\r\nsince the beginning of this century, every book on Antarctic\r\nexploration has dealt fully with this matter. I therefore briefly place\r\nbefore you the inception and organization of the Expedition, and insert\r\nhere the copy of the programme which I prepared in order to arouse the\r\ninterest of the general public in the Expedition.\r\n\r\n“_The Trans-continental Party._\r\n\r\n“The first crossing of the Antarctic continent, from sea to sea via the\r\nPole, apart from its historic value, will be a journey of great\r\nscientific importance.\r\n\r\n“The distance will be roughly 1800 miles, and the first half of this,\r\nfrom the Weddell Sea to the Pole, will be over unknown ground. Every\r\nstep will be an advance in geographical science. It will be learned\r\nwhether the great Victoria chain of mountains, which has been traced\r\nfrom the Ross Sea to the Pole, extends across the continent and thus\r\nlinks up (except for the ocean break) with the Andes of South America,\r\nand whether the great plateau around the Pole dips gradually towards\r\nthe Weddell Sea.\r\n\r\n“Continuous magnetic observations will be taken on the journey. The\r\nroute will lead towards the Magnetic Pole, and the determination of the\r\ndip of the magnetic needle will be of importance in practical\r\nmagnetism. The meteorological conditions will be carefully noted, and\r\nthis should help to solve many of our weather problems.\r\n\r\n“The glaciologist and geologist will study ice formations and the\r\nnature of the mountains, and this report will prove of great scientific\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n“_Scientific Work by Other Parties._\r\n\r\n“While the Trans-continental party is carrying out, for the British\r\nFlag, the greatest Polar journey ever attempted, the other parties will\r\nbe engaged in important scientific work.\r\n\r\n“Two sledging parties will operate from the base on the Weddell Sea.\r\nOne will travel westwards towards Graham Land, making observations,\r\ncollecting geological specimens, and proving whether there are\r\nmountains in that region linked up with those found on the other side\r\nof the Pole.\r\n\r\n“Another party will travel eastward toward Enderby Land, carrying out a\r\nsimilar programme, and a third, remaining at the base, will study the\r\nfauna of the land and sea, and the meteorological conditions.\r\n\r\n“From the Ross Sea base, on the other side of the Pole, another party\r\nwill push southward and will probably await the arrival of the\r\nTrans-continental party at the top of the Beardmore Glacier, near Mount\r\nBuckley, where the first seams of coal were discovered in the\r\nAntarctic. This region is of great importance to the geologist, who\r\nwill be enabled to read much of the history of the Antarctic in the\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n“Both the ships of the Expedition will be equipped for dredging,\r\nsounding, and every variety of hydrographical work. The Weddell Sea\r\nship will endeavour to trace the unknown coast-line of Graham Land, and\r\nfrom both the vessels, with their scientific staffs, important results\r\nmay be expected.\r\n\r\n“The several shore parties and the two ships will thus carry out\r\ngeographical and scientific work on a scale and over an area never\r\nbefore attempted by any one Polar expedition.\r\n\r\n“This will be the first use of the Weddell Sea as a base for\r\nexploration, and all the parties will open up vast stretches of unknown\r\nland. It is appropriate that this work should be carried out under the\r\nBritish Flag, since the whole of the area southward to the Pole is\r\nBritish territory. In July 1908, Letters Patent were issued under the\r\nGreat Seal declaring that the Governor of the Falkland Islands should\r\nbe the Governor of Graham Land (which forms the western side of the\r\nWeddell Sea), and another section of the same proclamation defines the\r\narea of British territory as ‘situated in the South Atlantic Ocean to\r\nthe south of the 50th parallel of south latitude, and lying between 20\r\ndegrees and 80 degrees west longitude.’ Reference to a map will show\r\nthat this includes the area in which the present Expedition will work.\r\n\r\n“_How the Continent will be crossed._\r\n\r\n“The Weddell Sea ship, with all the members of the Expedition operating\r\nfrom that base, will leave Buenos Ayres in October 1914, and endeavour\r\nto land in November in latitude 78 degrees south.\r\n\r\n“Should this be done, the Trans-continental party will set out on their\r\n1800-mile journey at once, in the hope of accomplishing the march\r\nacross the Pole and reaching the Ross Sea base in five months. Should\r\nthe landing be made too late in the season, the party will go into\r\nwinter quarters, lay out depots during the autumn and the following\r\nspring, and as early as possible in 1915 set out on the journey.\r\n\r\n“The Trans-continental party will be led by Sir Ernest Shackleton, and\r\nwill consist of six men. It will take 100 dogs with sledges, and two\r\nmotor-sledges with aerial propellers. The equipment will embody\r\neverything that the experience of the leader and his expert advisers\r\ncan suggest. When this party has reached the area of the Pole, after\r\ncovering 800 miles of unknown ground, it will strike due north towards\r\nthe head of the Beardmore Glacier, and there it is hoped to meet the\r\noutcoming party from the Ross Sea. Both will join up and make for the\r\nRoss Sea base, where the previous Expedition had its winter quarters.\r\n\r\n“In all, fourteen men will be landed by the _Endurance_ on the Weddell\r\nSea. Six will set out on the Trans-continental journey, three will go\r\nwestward, three eastward, and two remain at the base carrying on the\r\nwork already outlined.\r\n\r\n“The _Aurora_ will land six men at the Ross Sea base. They will lay\r\ndown depots on the route of the Trans-continental party, and make a\r\nmarch south to assist that party, and to make geological and other\r\nobservations as already described.\r\n\r\n“Should the Trans-continental party succeed, as is hoped, in crossing\r\nduring the first season, its return to civilization may be expected\r\nabout April 1915. The other sections in April 1916.\r\n\r\n“_The Ships of the Expedition._\r\n\r\n“The two ships for the Expedition have now been selected.\r\n\r\n“The _Endurance_, the ship which will take the Trans-continental party\r\nto the Weddell Sea, and will afterwards explore along an unknown\r\ncoast-line, is a new vessel, specially constructed for Polar work under\r\nthe supervision of a committee of Polar explorers. She was built by\r\nChristensen, the famous Norwegian constructor of sealing vessels, at\r\nSandefjord. She is barquentine rigged, and has triple-expansion engines\r\ngiving her a speed under steam of nine to ten knots. To enable her to\r\nstay longer at sea, she will carry oil fuel as well as coal. She is of\r\nabout 350 tons, and built of selected pine, oak, and greenheart. This\r\nfine vessel, equipped, has cost the Expedition £14,000.\r\n\r\n“The _Aurora_, the ship which will take out the Ross Sea party, has\r\nbeen bought from Dr. Mawson. She is similar in all respects to the\r\n_Terra Nova_, of Captain Scott’s last Expedition. She had extensive\r\nalterations made by the Government authorities in Australia to fit her\r\nfor Dr. Mawson’s Expedition, and is now at Hobart, Tasmania, where the\r\nRoss Sea party will join her in October next.”\r\n\r\nI started the preparations in the middle of 1913, but no public\r\nannouncement was made until January 13, 1914. For the last six months\r\nof 1913 I was engaged in the necessary preliminaries, solid mule work,\r\nshowing nothing particular to interest the public, but essential for an\r\nExpedition that had to have a ship on each side of the Continent, with\r\na land journey of eighteen hundred miles to be made, the first nine\r\nhundred miles to be across an absolutely unknown land mass.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1914, having received a promised financial support\r\nsufficient to warrant the announcement of the Expedition, I made it\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThe first result of this was a flood of applications from all classes\r\nof the community to join the adventure. I received nearly five thousand\r\napplications, and out of these were picked fifty-six men.\r\n\r\nIn March, to my great disappointment and anxiety, the promised\r\nfinancial help did not materialize, and I was now faced with the fact\r\nthat I had contracted for a ship and stores, and had engaged the staff,\r\nand I was not in possession of funds to meet these liabilities. I\r\nimmediately set about appealing for help, and met with generous\r\nresponse from all sides. I cannot here give the names of all who\r\nsupported my application, but whilst taking this opportunity of\r\nthanking every one for their support, which came from parts as far\r\napart as the interior of China, Japan, New Zealand, and Australia, I\r\nmust particularly refer to the munificent donation of £24,000 from the\r\nlate Sir James Caird, and to one of £10,000 from the British\r\nGovernment. I must also thank Mr. Dudley Docker, who enabled me to\r\ncomplete the purchase of the _Endurance_, and Miss Elizabeth Dawson\r\nLambton, who since 1901 has always been a firm friend to Antarctic\r\nexploration, and who again, on this occasion, assisted largely. The\r\nRoyal Geographical Society made a grant of £1000; and last, but by no\r\nmeans least, I take this opportunity of tendering my grateful thanks to\r\nDame Janet Stancomb Wills, whose generosity enabled me to equip the\r\n_Endurance_ efficiently, especially as regards boats (which boats were\r\nthe means of our ultimate safety), and who not only, at the inception\r\nof the Expedition, gave financial help, but also continued it through\r\nthe dark days when we were overdue, and funds were required to meet the\r\nneed of the dependents of the Expedition.\r\n\r\nThe only return and privilege an explorer has in the way of\r\nacknowledgment for the help accorded him is to record on the discovered\r\nlands the names of those to whom the Expedition owes its being.\r\n\r\nOwing to the exigencies of the war the publication of this book has\r\nbeen long delayed, and the detailed maps must come with the scientific\r\nmonographs. I have the honour to place on the new land the names of the\r\nabove and other generous donors to the Expedition. The two hundred\r\nmiles of new coast-line I have called Caird Coast. Also, as a more\r\npersonal note, I named the three ship’s boats, in which we ultimately\r\nescaped from the grip of the ice, after the three principal donors to\r\nthe Expedition—the _James Caird_, the _Stancomb Wills_ and the _Dudley\r\nDocker_. The two last-named are still on the desolate sandy spit of\r\nElephant Island, where under their shelter twenty-two of my comrades\r\neked out a bare existence for four and a half months.\r\n\r\nThe _James Caird_ is now in Liverpool, having been brought home from\r\nSouth Georgia after her adventurous voyage across the sub-Antarctic\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nMost of the Public Schools of England and Scotland helped the\r\nExpedition to purchase the dog teams, and I named a dog after each\r\nschool that helped. But apart from these particular donations I again\r\nthank the many people who assisted us.\r\n\r\nSo the equipment and organization went on. I purchased the _Aurora_\r\nfrom Sir Douglas Mawson, and arranged for Mackintosh to go to Australia\r\nand take charge of her, there sending sledges, equipment and most of\r\nthe stores from this side, but depending somewhat on the sympathy and\r\nhelp of Australia and New Zealand for coal and certain other\r\nnecessities, knowing that previously these two countries had always\r\ngenerously supported the exploration of what one might call their\r\nhinterland.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of July all was ready, when suddenly the war clouds\r\ndarkened over Europe.\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged for the _Endurance_ to proceed to Cowes, to be\r\ninspected by His Majesty on the Monday of Cowes week. But on Friday I\r\nreceived a message to say that the King would not be able to go to\r\nCowes. My readers will remember how suddenly came the menace of war.\r\nNaturally, both my comrades and I were greatly exercised as to the\r\nprobable outcome of the danger threatening the peace of the world.\r\n\r\nWe sailed from London on Friday, August 1, 1914, and anchored off\r\nSouthend all Saturday. On Sunday afternoon I took the ship off Margate,\r\ngrowing hourly more anxious as the ever-increasing rumours spread; and\r\non Monday morning I went ashore and read in the morning paper the order\r\nfor general mobilization.\r\n\r\nI immediately went on board and mustered all hands and told them that I\r\nproposed to send a telegram to the Admiralty offering the ships,\r\nstores, and, if they agreed, our own services to the country in the\r\nevent of war breaking out. All hands immediately agreed, and I sent off\r\na telegram in which everything was placed at the disposal of the\r\nAdmiralty. We only asked that, in the event of the declaration of war,\r\nthe Expedition might be considered as a single unit, so as to preserve\r\nits homogeneity. There were enough trained and experienced men amongst\r\nus to man a destroyer. Within an hour I received a laconic wire from\r\nthe Admiralty saying “Proceed.” Within two hours a longer wire came\r\nfrom Mr. Winston Churchill, in which we were thanked for our offer, and\r\nsaying that the authorities desired that the Expedition, which had the\r\nfull sanction and support of the Scientific and Geographical Societies,\r\nshould go on.\r\n\r\nSo, according to these definite instructions, the _Endurance_ sailed to\r\nPlymouth. On Tuesday the King sent for me and handed me the Union Jack\r\nto carry on the Expedition. That night, at midnight, war broke out. On\r\nthe following Saturday, August 8, the _Endurance_ sailed from Plymouth,\r\nobeying the direct order of the Admiralty. I make particular reference\r\nto this phase of the Expedition as I am aware that there was a certain\r\namount of criticism of the Expedition having left the country, and\r\nregarding this I wish further to add that the preparation of the\r\nExpedition had been proceeding for over a year, and large sums of money\r\nhad been spent. We offered to give the Expedition up without even\r\nconsulting the donors of this money, and but few thought that the war\r\nwould last through these five years and involve the whole world. The\r\nExpedition was not going on a peaceful cruise to the South Sea Islands,\r\nbut to a most dangerous, difficult, and strenuous work that has nearly\r\nalways involved a certain percentage of loss of life. Finally, when the\r\nExpedition did return, practically the whole of those members who had\r\ncome unscathed through the dangers of the Antarctic took their places\r\nin the wider field of battle, and the percentage of casualties amongst\r\nthe members of this Expedition is high.\r\n\r\nThe voyage out to Buenos Ayres was uneventful, and on October 26 we\r\nsailed from that port for South Georgia, the most southerly outpost of\r\nthe British Empire. Here, for a month, we were engaged in final\r\npreparation. The last we heard of the war was when we left Buenos\r\nAyres. Then the Russian Steam-Roller was advancing. According to many\r\nthe war would be over within six months. And so we left, not without\r\nregret that we could not take our place there, but secure in the\r\nknowledge that we were taking part in a strenuous campaign for the\r\ncredit of our country.\r\n\r\nApart from private individuals and societies I here acknowledge most\r\ngratefully the assistance rendered by the Dominion Government of New\r\nZealand and the Commonwealth Government of Australia at the start of\r\nthe Ross Sea section of the Expedition; and to the people of New\r\nZealand and the Dominion Government I tender my most grateful thanks\r\nfor their continued help, which was invaluable during the dark days\r\nbefore the relief of the Ross Sea Party.\r\n\r\nMr. James Allen (acting Premier), the late Mr. McNab (Minister of\r\nMarine), Mr. Leonard Tripp, Mr. Mabin, and Mr. Toogood, and many others\r\nhave laid me under a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid.\r\n\r\nThis is also the opportunity for me to thank the Uruguayan Government\r\nfor their generous assistance in placing the government trawler,\r\n_Instituto de Pesca_, for the second attempt at the relief of my men on\r\nElephant Island.\r\n\r\nFinally, it was the Chilian Government that was directly responsible\r\nfor the rescue of my comrades. This southern Republic was unwearied in\r\nits efforts to make a successful rescue, and the gratitude of our whole\r\nparty is due to them. I especially mention the sympathetic attitude of\r\nAdmiral Muñoz Hurtado, head of the Chilian Navy, and Captain Luis\r\nPardo, who commanded the _Yelcho_ on our last and successful venture.\r\n\r\nSir Daniel Gooch came with us as far as South Georgia. I owe him my\r\nspecial thanks for his help with the dogs, and we all regretted losing\r\nhis cheery presence, when we sailed for the South.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nINTO THE WEDDELL SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nI decided to leave South Georgia about December 5, and in the intervals\r\nof final preparation scanned again the plans for the voyage to winter\r\nquarters. What welcome was the Weddell Sea preparing for us? The\r\nwhaling captains at South Georgia were generously ready to share with\r\nme their knowledge of the waters in which they pursued their trade,\r\nand, while confirming earlier information as to the extreme severity of\r\nthe ice conditions in this sector of the Antarctic, they were able to\r\ngive advice that was worth attention.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to state here briefly some of the considerations\r\nthat weighed with me at that time and in the weeks that followed. I\r\nknew that the ice had come far north that season and, after listening\r\nto the suggestions of the whaling captains, had decided to steer to the\r\nSouth Sandwich Group, round Ultima Thule, and work as far to the\r\neastward as the fifteenth meridian west longitude before pushing south.\r\nThe whalers emphasized the difficulty of getting through the ice in the\r\nneighbourhood of the South Sandwich Group. They told me they had often\r\nseen the floes come right up to the group in the summer-time, and they\r\nthought the Expedition would have to push through heavy pack in order\r\nto reach the Weddell Sea. Probably the best time to get into the\r\nWeddell Sea would be the end of February or the beginning of March. The\r\nwhalers had gone right round the South Sandwich Group and they were\r\nfamiliar with the conditions. The predictions they made induced me to\r\ntake the deck-load of coal, for if we had to fight our way through to\r\nCoats’ Land we would need every ton of fuel the ship could carry.\r\n\r\nI hoped that by first moving to the east as far as the fifteenth\r\nmeridian west we would be able to go south through looser ice, pick up\r\nCoats’ Land and finally reach Vahsel Bay, where Filchner made his\r\nattempt at landing in 1912. Two considerations were occupying my mind\r\nat this juncture. I was anxious for certain reasons to winter the\r\n_Endurance_ in the Weddell Sea, but the difficulty of finding a safe\r\nharbour might be very great. If no safe harbour could be found, the\r\nship must winter at South Georgia. It seemed to me hopeless now to\r\nthink of making the journey across the continent in the first summer,\r\nas the season was far advanced and the ice conditions were likely to\r\nprove unfavourable. In view of the possibility of wintering the ship in\r\nthe ice, we took extra clothing from the stores at the various stations\r\nin South Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe other question that was giving me anxious thought was the size of\r\nthe shore party. If the ship had to go out during the winter, or if she\r\nbroke away from winter quarters, it would be preferable to have only a\r\nsmall, carefully selected party of men ashore after the hut had been\r\nbuilt and the stores landed. These men could proceed to lay out depots\r\nby man-haulage and make short journeys with the dogs, training them for\r\nthe long early march in the following spring. The majority of the\r\nscientific men would live aboard the ship, where they could do their\r\nwork under good conditions. They would be able to make short journeys\r\nif required, using the _Endurance_ as a base. All these plans were\r\nbased on an expectation that the finding of winter quarters was likely\r\nto be difficult. If a really safe base could be established on the\r\ncontinent, I would adhere to the original programme of sending one\r\nparty to the south, one to the west round the head of the Weddell Sea\r\ntowards Graham Land, and one to the east towards Enderby Land.\r\n\r\nWe had worked out details of distances, courses, stores required, and\r\nso forth. Our sledging ration, the result of experience as well as\r\nclose study, was perfect. The dogs gave promise, after training, of\r\nbeing able to cover fifteen to twenty miles a day with loaded sledges.\r\nThe trans-continental journey, at this rate, should be completed in 120\r\ndays unless some unforeseen obstacle intervened. We longed keenly for\r\nthe day when we could begin this march, the last great adventure in the\r\nhistory of South Polar exploration, but a knowledge of the obstacles\r\nthat lay between us and our starting-point served as a curb on\r\nimpatience. Everything depended upon the landing. If we could land at\r\nFilchner’s base there was no reason why a band of experienced men\r\nshould not winter there in safety. But the Weddell Sea was notoriously\r\ninhospitable and already we knew that its sternest face was turned\r\ntoward us. All the conditions in the Weddell Sea are unfavourable from\r\nthe navigator’s point of view. The winds are comparatively light, and\r\nconsequently new ice can form even in the summer-time. The absence of\r\nstrong winds has the additional effect of allowing the ice to\r\naccumulate in masses, undisturbed. Then great quantities of ice sweep\r\nalong the coast from the east under the influence of the prevailing\r\ncurrent, and fill up the bight of the Weddell Sea as they move north in\r\na great semicircle. Some of this ice doubtless describes almost a\r\ncomplete circle, and is held up eventually, in bad seasons, against the\r\nSouth Sandwich Islands. The strong currents, pressing the ice masses\r\nagainst the coasts, create heavier pressure than is found in any other\r\npart of the Antarctic. This pressure must be at least as severe as the\r\npressure experienced in the congested North Polar basin, and I am\r\ninclined to think that a comparison would be to the advantage of the\r\nArctic. All these considerations naturally had a bearing upon our\r\nimmediate problem, the penetration of the pack and the finding of a\r\nsafe harbour on the continental coast.\r\n\r\nThe day of departure arrived. I gave the order to heave anchor at 8.45\r\na.m. on December 5, 1914, and the clanking of the windlass broke for us\r\nthe last link with civilization. The morning was dull and overcast,\r\nwith occasional gusts of snow and sleet, but hearts were light aboard\r\nthe _Endurance_. The long days of preparation were over and the\r\nadventure lay ahead.\r\n\r\nWe had hoped that some steamer from the north would bring news of war\r\nand perhaps letters from home before our departure. A ship did arrive\r\non the evening of the 4th, but she carried no letters, and nothing\r\nuseful in the way of information could be gleaned from her. The captain\r\nand crew were all stoutly pro-German, and the “news” they had to give\r\ntook the unsatisfying form of accounts of British and French reverses.\r\nWe would have been glad to have had the latest tidings from a\r\nfriendlier source. A year and a half later we were to learn that the\r\n_Harpoon_, the steamer which tends the Grytviken station, had arrived\r\nwith mail for us not more than two hours after the _Endurance_ had\r\nproceeded down the coast.\r\n\r\nThe bows of the _Endurance_ were turned to the south, and the good ship\r\ndipped to the south-westerly swell. Misty rain fell during the\r\nforenoon, but the weather cleared later in the day, and we had a good\r\nview of the coast of South Georgia as we moved under steam and sail to\r\nthe south-east. The course was laid to carry us clear of the island and\r\nthen south of South Thule, Sandwich Group. The wind freshened during\r\nthe day, and all square sail was set, with the foresail reefed in order\r\nto give the look-out a clear view ahead; for we did not wish to risk\r\ncontact with a “growler,” one of those treacherous fragments of ice\r\nthat float with surface awash. The ship was very steady in the\r\nquarterly sea, but certainly did not look as neat and trim as she had\r\ndone when leaving the shores of England four months earlier. We had\r\nfilled up with coal at Grytviken, and this extra fuel was stored on\r\ndeck, where it impeded movement considerably. The carpenter had built a\r\nfalse deck, extending from the poop-deck to the chart-room. We had also\r\ntaken aboard a ton of whale-meat for the dogs. The big chunks of meat\r\nwere hung up in the rigging, out of reach but not out of sight of the\r\ndogs, and as the _Endurance_ rolled and pitched, they watched with\r\nwolfish eyes for a windfall.\r\n\r\nI was greatly pleased with the dogs, which were tethered about the ship\r\nin the most comfortable positions we could find for them. They were in\r\nexcellent condition, and I felt that the Expedition had the right\r\ntractive-power. They were big, sturdy animals, chosen for endurance and\r\nstrength, and if they were as keen to pull our sledges as they were now\r\nto fight one another all would be well. The men in charge of the dogs\r\nwere doing their work enthusiastically, and the eagerness they showed\r\nto study the natures and habits of their charges gave promise of\r\nefficient handling and good work later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Leader]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Weddell Sea Party]\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring December 6 the _Endurance_ made good progress on a\r\nsouth-easterly course. The northerly breeze had freshened during the\r\nnight and had brought up a high following sea. The weather was hazy,\r\nand we passed two bergs, several growlers, and numerous lumps of ice.\r\nStaff and crew were settling down to the routine. Bird life was\r\nplentiful, and we noticed Cape pigeons, whale-birds, terns, mollymauks,\r\nnellies, sooty, and wandering albatrosses in the neighbourhood of the\r\nship. The course was laid for the passage between Sanders Island and\r\nCandlemas Volcano. December 7 brought the first check. At six o’clock\r\nthat morning the sea, which had been green in colour all the previous\r\nday, changed suddenly to a deep indigo. The ship was behaving well in a\r\nrough sea, and some members of the scientific staff were transferring\r\nto the bunkers the coal we had stowed on deck. Sanders Island and\r\nCandlemas were sighted early in the afternoon, and the _Endurance_\r\npassed between them at 6 p.m. Worsley’s observations indicated that\r\nSanders Island was, roughly, three miles east and five miles north of\r\nthe charted position. Large numbers of bergs, mostly tabular in form,\r\nlay to the west of the islands, and we noticed that many of them were\r\nyellow with _diatoms_. One berg had large patches of red-brown soil\r\ndown its sides. The presence of so many bergs was ominous, and\r\nimmediately after passing between the islands we encountered\r\nstream-ice. All sail was taken in and we proceeded slowly under steam.\r\nTwo hours later, fifteen miles north-east of Sanders Island, the\r\n_Endurance_ was confronted by a belt of heavy pack-ice, half a mile\r\nbroad and extending north and south. There was clear water beyond, but\r\nthe heavy south-westerly swell made the pack impenetrable in our\r\nneighbourhood. This was disconcerting. The noon latitude had been 57°\r\n26´ S., and I had not expected to find pack-ice nearly so far north,\r\nthough the whalers had reported pack-ice right up to South Thule.\r\n\r\nThe situation became dangerous that night. We pushed into the pack in\r\nthe hope of reaching open water beyond, and found ourselves after dark\r\nin a pool which was growing smaller and smaller. The ice was grinding\r\naround the ship in the heavy swell, and I watched with some anxiety for\r\nany indication of a change of wind to the east, since a breeze from\r\nthat quarter would have driven us towards the land. Worsley and I were\r\non deck all night, dodging the pack. At 3 a.m. we ran south, taking\r\nadvantage of some openings that had appeared, but met heavy rafted\r\npack-ice, evidently old; some of it had been subjected to severe\r\npressure. Then we steamed north-west and saw open water to the\r\nnorth-east. I put the _Endurance’s_ head for the opening, and, steaming\r\nat full speed, we got clear. Then we went east in the hope of getting\r\nbetter ice, and five hours later, after some dodging, we rounded the\r\npack and were able to set sail once more. This initial tussle with the\r\npack had been exciting at times. Pieces of ice and bergs of all sizes\r\nwere heaving and jostling against each other in the heavy\r\nsouth-westerly swell. In spite of all our care the _Endurance_ struck\r\nlarge lumps stem on, but the engines were stopped in time and no harm\r\nwas done. The scene and sounds throughout the day were very fine. The\r\nswell was dashing against the sides of huge bergs and leaping right to\r\nthe top of their icy cliffs. Sanders Island lay to the south, with a\r\nfew rocky faces peering through the misty, swirling clouds that swathed\r\nit most of the time, the booming of the sea running into ice-caverns,\r\nthe swishing break of the swell on the loose pack, and the graceful\r\nbowing and undulating of the inner pack to the steeply rolling swell,\r\nwhich here was robbed of its break by the masses of ice to windward.\r\n\r\nWe skirted the northern edge of the pack in clear weather with a light\r\nsouth-westerly breeze and an overcast sky. The bergs were numerous.\r\nDuring the morning of December 9 an easterly breeze brought hazy\r\nweather with snow, and at 4.30 p.m. we encountered the edge of pack-ice\r\nin lat. 58° 27´ S., long. 22° 08´ W. It was one-year-old ice\r\ninterspersed with older pack, all heavily snow-covered and lying\r\nwest-south-west to east-north-east. We entered the pack at 5 p.m., but\r\ncould not make progress, and cleared it again at 7.40 p.m. Then we\r\nsteered east-north-east and spent the rest of the night rounding the\r\npack. During the day we had seen adelie and ringed penguins, also\r\nseveral humpback and finner whales. An ice-blink to the westward\r\nindicated the presence of pack in that direction. After rounding the\r\npack we steered S. 40° E., and at noon on the 10th had reached lat. 58°\r\n28´ S., long. 20° 28´ W. Observations showed the compass variation to\r\nbe 1½° less than the chart recorded. I kept the _Endurance_ on the\r\ncourse till midnight, when we entered loose open ice about ninety miles\r\nsouth-east of our noon position. This ice proved to fringe the pack,\r\nand progress became slow. There was a long easterly swell with a light\r\nnortherly breeze, and the weather was clear and fine. Numerous bergs\r\nlay outside the pack.\r\n\r\nThe _Endurance_ steamed through loose open ice till 8 a.m. on the 11th,\r\nwhen we entered the pack in lat. 59° 46´ S., long. 18° 22´ W. We could\r\nhave gone farther east, but the pack extended far in that direction,\r\nand an effort to circle it might have involved a lot of northing. I did\r\nnot wish to lose the benefit of the original southing. The extra miles\r\nwould not have mattered to a ship with larger coal capacity than the\r\n_Endurance_ possessed, but we could not afford to sacrifice miles\r\nunnecessarily. The pack was loose and did not present great\r\ndifficulties at this stage. The foresail was set in order to take\r\nadvantage of the northerly breeze. The ship was in contact with the ice\r\noccasionally and received some heavy blows. Once or twice she was\r\nbrought up all standing against solid pieces, but no harm was done. The\r\nchief concern was to protect the propeller and rudder. If a collision\r\nseemed to be inevitable the officer in charge would order “slow” or\r\n“half speed” with the engines, and put the helm over so as to strike\r\nfloe a glancing blow. Then the helm would be put over towards the ice\r\nwith the object of throwing the propeller clear of it, and the ship\r\nwould forge ahead again. Worsley, Wild, and I, with three officers,\r\nkept three watches while we were working through the pack, so that we\r\nhad two officers on deck all the time. The carpenter had rigged a\r\nsix-foot wooden semaphore on the bridge to enable the navigating\r\nofficer to give the seamen or scientists at the wheel the direction and\r\nthe exact amount of helm required. This device saved time, as well as\r\nthe effort of shouting. We were pushing through this loose pack all\r\nday, and the view from the crow’s-nest gave no promise of improved\r\nconditions ahead. A Weddell seal and a crab-eater seal were noticed on\r\nthe floes, but we did not pause to secure fresh meat. It was important\r\nthat we should make progress towards our goal as rapidly as possible,\r\nand there was reason to fear that we should have plenty of time to\r\nspare later on if the ice conditions continued to increase in severity.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of December 12 we were working through loose pack which\r\nlater became thick in places. The sky was overcast and light snow was\r\nfalling. I had all square sail set at 7 a.m. in order to take advantage\r\nof the northerly breeze, but it had to come in again five hours later\r\nwhen the wind hauled round to the west. The noon position was lat. 60°\r\n26´ S., long. 17° 58´ W., and the run for the twenty-four hours had\r\nbeen only 33 miles. The ice was still badly congested, and we were\r\npushing through narrow leads and occasional openings with the floes\r\noften close abeam on either side. Antarctic, snow and stormy petrels,\r\nfulmars, white-rumped terns, and adelies were around us. The quaint\r\nlittle penguins found the ship a cause of much apparent excitement and\r\nprovided a lot of amusement aboard. One of the standing jokes was that\r\nall the adelies on the floe seemed to know Clark, and when he was at\r\nthe wheel rushed along as fast as their legs could carry them, yelling\r\nout “Clark! Clark!” and apparently very indignant and perturbed that he\r\nnever waited for them or even answered them.\r\n\r\nWe found several good leads to the south in the evening, and continued\r\nto work southward throughout the night and the following day. The pack\r\nextended in all directions as far as the eye could reach. The noon\r\nobservation showed the run for the twenty-four hours to be 54 miles, a\r\nsatisfactory result under the conditions. Wild shot a young Ross seal\r\non the floe, and we manœuvred the ship alongside. Hudson jumped down,\r\nbent a line on to the seal, and the pair of them were hauled up. The\r\nseal was 4 ft. 9 in. long and weighed about ninety pounds. He was a\r\nyoung male and proved very good eating, but when dressed and minus the\r\nblubber made little more than a square meal for our twenty-eight men,\r\nwith a few scraps for our breakfast and tea. The stomach contained only\r\n_amphipods_ about an inch long, allied to those found in the whales at\r\nGrytviken.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Young Emperor Penguins]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Huge Floe of Consolidated Pack]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conditions became harder on December 14. There was a misty haze,\r\nand occasional falls of snow. A few bergs were in sight. The pack was\r\ndenser than it had been on the previous days. Older ice was\r\nintermingled with the young ice, and our progress became slower. The\r\npropeller received several blows in the early morning, but no damage\r\nwas done. A platform was rigged under the jib-boom in order that Hurley\r\nmight secure some kinematograph pictures of the ship breaking through\r\nthe ice. The young ice did not present difficulties to the _Endurance_,\r\nwhich was able to smash a way through, but the lumps of older ice were\r\nmore formidable obstacles, and conning the ship was a task requiring\r\nclose attention. The most careful navigation could not prevent an\r\noccasional bump against ice too thick to be broken or pushed aside. The\r\nsoutherly breeze strengthened to a moderate south-westerly gale during\r\nthe afternoon, and at 8 p.m. we hove to, stem against a floe, it being\r\nimpossible to proceed without serious risk of damage to rudder or\r\npropeller. I was interested to notice that, although we had been\r\nsteaming through the pack for three days, the north-westerly swell\r\nstill held with us. It added to the difficulties of navigation in the\r\nlanes, since the ice was constantly in movement.\r\n\r\nThe _Endurance_ remained against the floe for the next twenty-four\r\nhours, when the gale moderated. The pack extended to the horizon in all\r\ndirections and was broken by innumerable narrow lanes. Many bergs were\r\nin sight, and they appeared to be travelling through the pack in a\r\nsouth-westerly direction under the current influence. Probably the pack\r\nitself was moving north-east with the gale. Clark put down a net in\r\nsearch of specimens, and at two fathoms it was carried south-west by\r\nthe current and fouled the propeller. He lost the net, two leads, and a\r\nline. Ten bergs drove to the south through the pack during the\r\ntwenty-four hours. The noon position was 61° 31´ S., long. 18° 12´ W.\r\nThe gale had moderated at 8 p.m., and we made five miles to the south\r\nbefore midnight and then we stopped at the end of a long lead, waiting\r\ntill the weather cleared. It was during this short run that the\r\ncaptain, with semaphore hard-a-port, shouted to the scientist at the\r\nwheel: “Why in Paradise don’t you port!” The answer came in indignant\r\ntones: “I am blowing my nose.”\r\n\r\nThe _Endurance_ made some progress on the following day. Long leads of\r\nopen water ran towards the south-west, and the ship smashed at full\r\nspeed through occasional areas of young ice till brought up with a\r\nheavy thud against a section of older floe. Worsley was out on the\r\njib-boom end for a few minutes while Wild was conning the ship, and he\r\ncame back with a glowing account of a novel sensation. The boom was\r\nswinging high and low and from side to side, while the massive bows of\r\nthe ship smashed through the ice, splitting it across, piling it mass\r\non mass and then shouldering it aside. The air temperature was 37°\r\nFahr., pleasantly warm, and the water temperature 29° Fahr. We\r\ncontinued to advance through fine long leads till 4 a.m. on December\r\n17, when the ice became difficult again. Very large floes of\r\nsix-months-old ice lay close together. Some of these floes presented a\r\nsquare mile of unbroken surface, and among them were patches of thin\r\nice and several floes of heavy old ice. Many bergs were in sight, and\r\nthe course became devious. The ship was blocked at one point by a\r\nwedge-shaped piece of floe, but we put the ice-anchor through it, towed\r\nit astern, and proceeded through the gap. Steering under these\r\nconditions required muscle as well as nerve. There was a clatter aft\r\nduring the afternoon, and Hussey, who was at the wheel, explained that\r\n“The wheel spun round and threw me over the top of it!” The noon\r\nposition was lat. 62° 13´ S., long. 18° 53´ W., and the run for the\r\npreceding twenty-four hours had been 32 miles in a south-westerly\r\ndirection. We saw three blue whales during the day and one emperor\r\npenguin, a 58-lb. bird, which was added to the larder.\r\n\r\nThe morning of December 18 found the _Endurance_ proceeding amongst\r\nlarge floes with thin ice between them. The leads were few. There was a\r\nnortherly breeze with occasional snow-flurries. We secured three\r\ncrab-eater seals—two cows and a bull. The bull was a fine specimen,\r\nnearly white all over and 9 ft. 3 in. long; he weighed 600 lbs. Shortly\r\nbefore noon further progress was barred by heavy pack, and we put an\r\nice-anchor on the floe and banked the fires. I had been prepared for\r\nevil conditions in the Weddell Sea, but had hoped that in December and\r\nJanuary, at any rate, the pack would be loose, even if no open water\r\nwas to be found. What we were actually encountering was fairly dense\r\npack of a very obstinate character. Pack-ice might be described as a\r\ngigantic and interminable jigsaw-puzzle devised by nature. The parts of\r\nthe puzzle in loose pack have floated slightly apart and become\r\ndisarranged; at numerous places they have pressed together again; as\r\nthe pack gets closer the congested areas grow larger and the parts are\r\njammed harder till finally it becomes “close pack,” when the whole of\r\nthe jigsaw-puzzle becomes jammed to such an extent that with care and\r\nlabour it can be traversed in every direction on foot. Where the parts\r\ndo not fit closely there is, of course, open water, which freezes over,\r\nin a few hours after giving off volumes of “frost-smoke.” In obedience\r\nto renewed pressure this young ice “rafts,” so forming double\r\nthicknesses of a toffee-like consistency. Again the opposing edges of\r\nheavy floes rear up in slow and almost silent conflict, till high\r\n“hedgerows” are formed round each part of the puzzle. At the junction\r\nof several floes chaotic areas of piled-up blocks and masses of ice are\r\nformed. Sometimes 5-ft. to 6-ft. piles of evenly shaped blocks of ice\r\nare seen so neatly laid that it seems impossible for them to be\r\nNature’s work. Again, a winding canyon may be traversed between icy\r\nwalls 6 ft. to 10 ft. high, or a dome may be formed that under renewed\r\npressure bursts upward like a volcano. All the winter the drifting pack\r\nchanges—grows by freezing, thickens by rafting, and corrugates by\r\npressure. If, finally, in its drift it impinges on a coast, such as the\r\nwestern shore of the Weddell Sea, terrific pressure is set up and an\r\ninferno of ice-blocks, ridges, and hedgerows results, extending\r\npossibly for 150 or 200 miles off shore. Sections of pressure ice may\r\ndrift away subsequently and become embedded in new ice.\r\n\r\nI have given this brief explanation here in order that the reader may\r\nunderstand the nature of the ice through which we pushed our way for\r\nmany hundreds of miles. Another point that may require to be explained\r\nwas the delay caused by wind while we were in the pack. When a strong\r\nbreeze or moderate gale was blowing the ship could not safely work\r\nthrough any except young ice, up to about two feet in thickness. As ice\r\nof that nature never extended for more than a mile or so, it followed\r\nthat in a gale in the pack we had always to lie to. The ship was 3 ft.\r\n3 in. down by the stern, and while this saved the propeller and rudder\r\na good deal, it made the _Endurance_ practically unmanageable in close\r\npack when the wind attained a force of six miles an hour from ahead,\r\nsince the air currents had such a big surface forward to act upon. The\r\npressure of wind on bows and the yards of the foremast would cause the\r\nbows to fall away, and in these conditions the ship could not be\r\nsteered into the narrow lanes and leads through which we had to thread\r\nour way. The falling away of the bows, moreover, would tend to bring\r\nthe stern against the ice, compelling us to stop the engines in order\r\nto save the propeller. Then the ship would become unmanageable and\r\ndrift away, with the possibility of getting excessive sternway on her\r\nand so damaging rudder or propeller, the Achilles’ heel of a ship in\r\npack-ice.\r\n\r\nWhile we were waiting for the weather to moderate and the ice to open,\r\nI had the Lucas sounding-machine rigged over the rudder-trunk and found\r\nthe depth to be 2810 fathoms. The bottom sample was lost owing to the\r\nline parting 60 fathoms from the end. During the afternoon three adelie\r\npenguins approached the ship across the floe while Hussey was\r\ndiscoursing sweet music on the banjo. The solemn-looking little birds\r\nappeared to appreciate “It’s a Long Way to Tipperary,” but they fled in\r\nhorror when Hussey treated them to a little of the music that comes\r\nfrom Scotland. The shouts of laughter from the ship added to their\r\ndismay, and they made off as fast as their short legs would carry them.\r\nThe pack opened slightly at 6.15 p.m., and we proceeded through lanes\r\nfor three hours before being forced to anchor to a floe for the night.\r\nWe fired a Hjort mark harpoon, No. 171, into a blue whale on this day.\r\nThe conditions did not improve during December 19. A fresh to strong\r\nnortherly breeze brought haze and snow, and after proceeding for two\r\nhours the _Endurance_ was stopped again by heavy floes. It was\r\nimpossible to manœuvre the ship in the ice owing to the strong wind,\r\nwhich kept the floes in movement and caused lanes to open and close\r\nwith dangerous rapidity. The noon observation showed that we had made\r\nsix miles to the south-east in the previous twenty-four hours. All\r\nhands were engaged during the day in rubbing shoots off our potatoes,\r\nwhich were found to be sprouting freely. We remained moored to a floe\r\nover the following day, the wind not having moderated; indeed, it\r\nfreshened to a gale in the afternoon, and the members of the staff and\r\ncrew took advantage of the pause to enjoy a vigorously contested game\r\nof football on the level surface of the floe alongside the ship. Twelve\r\nbergs were in sight at this time. The noon position was lat. 62° 42´\r\nS., long. 17° 54´ W., showing that we had drifted about six miles in a\r\nnorth-easterly direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Samson]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ice-Flowers]\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday, December 21, was beautifully fine, with a gentle\r\nwest-north-westerly breeze. We made a start at 3 a.m. and proceeded\r\nthrough the pack in a south-westerly direction. At noon we had gained\r\nseven miles almost due east, the northerly drift of the pack having\r\ncontinued while the ship was apparently moving to the south. Petrels of\r\nseveral species, penguins, and seals were plentiful, and we saw four\r\nsmall blue whales. At noon we entered a long lead to the southward and\r\npassed around and between nine splendid bergs. One mighty specimen was\r\nshaped like the Rock of Gibraltar but with steeper cliffs, and another\r\nhad a natural dock that would have contained the _Aquitania_. A spur of\r\nice closed the entrance to the huge blue pool. Hurley brought out his\r\nkinematograph-camera, in order to make a record of these bergs. Fine\r\nlong leads running east and south-east among bergs were found during\r\nthe afternoon, but at midnight the ship was stopped by small, heavy\r\nice-floes, tightly packed against an unbroken plain of ice. The outlook\r\nfrom the mast-head was not encouraging. The big floe was at least 15\r\nmiles long and 10 miles wide. The edge could not be seen at the widest\r\npart, and the area of the floe must have been not less than 150 square\r\nmiles. It appeared to be formed of year-old ice, not very thick and\r\nwith very few hummocks or ridges in it. We thought it must have been\r\nformed at sea in very calm weather and drifted up from the south-east.\r\nI had never seen such a large area of unbroken ice in the Ross Sea.\r\n\r\nWe waited with banked fires for the strong easterly breeze to moderate\r\nor the pack to open. At 6.30 p.m. on December 22 some lanes opened and\r\nwe were able to move towards the south again. The following morning\r\nfound us working slowly through the pack, and the noon observation gave\r\nus a gain of 19 miles S. 41° W. for the seventeen and a half hours\r\nunder steam. Many year-old adelies, three crab-eaters, six\r\nsea-leopards, one Weddell and two blue whales were seen. The air\r\ntemperature, which had been down to 25° Fahr. on December 21, had risen\r\nto 34° Fahr. While we were working along leads to the southward in the\r\nafternoon, we counted fifteen bergs. Three of these were table-topped,\r\nand one was about 70 ft high and 5 miles long. Evidently it had come\r\nfrom a barrier-edge. The ice became heavier but slightly more open, and\r\nwe had a calm night with fine long leads of open water. The water was\r\nso still that new ice was forming on the leads. We had a run of 70\r\nmiles to our credit at noon on December 24, the position being lat. 64°\r\n32´ S., long. 17° 17´ W. All the dogs except eight had been named. I do\r\nnot know who had been responsible for some of the names, which seemed\r\nto represent a variety of tastes. They were as follows Rugby, Upton\r\nBristol, Millhill, Songster, Sandy, Mack, Mercury, Wolf, Amundsen,\r\nHercules, Hackenschmidt, Samson, Sammy, Skipper, Caruso, Sub, Ulysses,\r\nSpotty, Bosun, Slobbers, Sadie, Sue, Sally, Jasper, Tim, Sweep, Martin,\r\nSplitlip, Luke, Saint, Satan, Chips, Stumps, Snapper, Painful, Bob,\r\nSnowball, Jerry, Judge, Sooty, Rufus, Sidelights, Simeon, Swanker,\r\nChirgwin, Steamer, Peter, Fluffy, Steward, Slippery, Elliott, Roy,\r\nNoel, Shakespeare, Jamie, Bummer, Smuts, Lupoid, Spider, and Sailor.\r\nSome of the names, it will be noticed, had a descriptive flavour.\r\n\r\nHeavy floes held up the ship from midnight till 6 a.m. on December 25,\r\nChristmas Day. Then they opened a little and we made progress till\r\n11.30 a.m., when the leads closed again. We had encountered good leads\r\nand workable ice during the early part of the night, and the noon\r\nobservation showed that our run for the twenty-four hours was the best\r\nsince we entered the pack a fortnight earlier. We had made 71 miles S.\r\n4° W. The ice held us up till the evening, and then we were able to\r\nfollow some leads for a couple of hours before the tightly packed floes\r\nand the increasing wind compelled a stop. The celebration of Christmas\r\nwas not forgotten. Grog was served at midnight to all on deck. There\r\nwas grog again at breakfast, for the benefit of those who had been in\r\ntheir bunks at midnight. Lees had decorated the wardroom with flags and\r\nhad a little Christmas present for each of us. Some of us had presents\r\nfrom home to open. Later there was a really splendid dinner, consisting\r\nof turtle soup, whitebait, jugged hare, Christmas pudding, mince-pies,\r\ndates, figs and crystallized fruits, with rum and stout as drinks. In\r\nthe evening everybody joined in a “sing-song.” Hussey had made a\r\none-stringed violin, on which, in the words of Worsley, he “discoursed\r\nquite painlessly.” The wind was increasing to a moderate south-easterly\r\ngale and no advance could be made, so we were able to settle down to\r\nthe enjoyments of the evening.\r\n\r\nThe weather was still bad on December 26 and 27, and the _Endurance_\r\nremained anchored to a floe. The noon position on the 26th was lat. 65°\r\n43´ S., long. 17° 36´ W. We made another sounding on this day with the\r\nLucas machine and found bottom at 2819 fathoms. The specimen brought up\r\nwas a terrigenous blue mud (glacial deposit) with some _radiolaria_.\r\nEvery one took turns at the work of heaving in, two men working\r\ntogether in ten-minute spells.\r\n\r\nSunday, December 27, was a quiet day aboard. The southerly gale was\r\nblowing the snow in clouds off the floe and the temperature had fallen\r\nto 23° Fahr. The dogs were having an uncomfortable time in their deck\r\nquarters. The wind had moderated by the following morning, but it was\r\nsqually with snow-flurries, and I did not order a start till 11 p.m.\r\nThe pack was still close, but the ice was softer and more easily\r\nbroken. During the pause the carpenter had rigged a small stage over\r\nthe stern. A man was stationed there to watch the propeller and prevent\r\nit striking heavy ice, and the arrangement proved very valuable. It\r\nsaved the rudder as well as the propeller from many blows.\r\n\r\nThe high winds that had prevailed for four and a half days gave way to\r\na gentle southerly breeze in the evening of December 29. Owing to the\r\ndrift we were actually eleven miles farther north than we had been on\r\nDecember 25. But we made fairly good progress on the 30th in fine,\r\nclear weather. The ship followed a long lead to the south-east during\r\nthe afternoon and evening, and at 11 p.m. we crossed the Antarctic\r\nCircle. An examination of the horizon disclosed considerable breaks in\r\nthe vast circle of pack-ice, interspersed with bergs of different\r\nsizes. Leads could be traced in various directions, but I looked in\r\nvain for an indication of open water. The sun did not set that night,\r\nand as it was concealed behind a bank of clouds we had a glow of\r\ncrimson and gold to the southward, with delicate pale green reflections\r\nin the water of the lanes to the south-east.\r\n\r\nThe ship had a serious encounter with the ice on the morning of\r\nDecember 31. We were stopped first by floes closing around us, and then\r\nabout noon the _Endurance_ got jammed between two floes heading\r\neast-north-east. The pressure heeled the ship over six degrees while we\r\nwere getting an ice-anchor on to the floe in order to heave astern and\r\nthus assist the engines, which were running at full speed. The effort\r\nwas successful. Immediately afterwards, at the spot where the\r\n_Endurance_ had been held, slabs of ice 50 ft. by 15 ft. and 4 ft.\r\nthick were forced ten or twelve feet up on the lee floe at an angle of\r\n45°. The pressure was severe, and we were not sorry to have the ship\r\nout of its reach. The noon position was lat. 66° 47´ S., long. 15° 52´\r\nW., and the run for the preceding twenty-four hours was 51 miles S. 29°\r\nE.\r\n\r\n“Since noon the character of the pack has improved,” wrote Worsley on\r\nthis day. “Though the leads are short, the floes are rotten and easily\r\nbroken through if a good place is selected with care and judgment. In\r\nmany cases we find large sheets of young ice through which the ship\r\ncuts for a mile or two miles at a stretch. I have been conning and\r\nworking the ship from the crow’s-nest and find it much the best place,\r\nas from there one can see ahead and work out the course beforehand, and\r\ncan also guard the rudder and propeller, the most vulnerable parts of a\r\nship in the ice. At midnight, as I was sitting in the ‘tub’ I heard a\r\nclamorous noise down on the deck, with ringing of bells, and realized\r\nthat it was the New Year.” Worsley came down from his lofty seat and\r\nmet Wild, Hudson, and myself on the bridge, where we shook hands and\r\nwished one another a happy and successful New Year. Since entering the\r\npack on December 11 we had come 480 miles, through loose and close\r\npack-ice. We had pushed and fought the little ship through, and she had\r\nstood the test well, though the propeller had received some shrewd\r\nblows against hard ice and the vessel had been driven against the floe\r\nuntil she had fairly mounted up on it and slid back rolling heavily\r\nfrom side to side. The rolling had been more frequently caused by the\r\noperation of cracking through thickish young ice, where the crack had\r\ntaken a sinuous course. The ship, in attempting to follow it, struck\r\nfirst one bilge and then the other, causing her to roll six or seven\r\ndegrees. Our advance through the pack had been in a S. 10° E.\r\ndirection, and I estimated that the total steaming distance had\r\nexceeded 700 miles. The first 100 miles had been through loose pack,\r\nbut the greatest hindrances had been three moderate south-westerly\r\ngales, two lasting for three days each and one for four and a half\r\ndays. The last 250 miles had been through close pack alternating with\r\nfine long leads and stretches of open water.\r\n\r\nDuring the weeks we spent manœuvring to the south through the tortuous\r\nmazes of the pack it was necessary often to split floes by driving the\r\nship against them. This form of attack was effective against ice up to\r\nthree feet in thickness, and the process is interesting enough to be\r\nworth describing briefly. When the way was barred by a floe of moderate\r\nthickness we would drive the ship at half speed against it, stopping\r\nthe engines just before the impact. At the first blow the _Endurance_\r\nwould cut a V-shaped nick in the face of the floe, the slope of her\r\ncutwater often causing her bows to rise till nearly clear of the water,\r\nwhen she would slide backwards, rolling slightly. Watching carefully\r\nthat loose lumps of ice did not damage the propeller, we would reverse\r\nthe engines and back the ship off 200 to 300 yds. She would then be\r\ndriven full speed into the V, taking care to hit the centre accurately.\r\nThe operation would be repeated until a short dock was cut, into which\r\nthe ship, acting as a large wedge, was driven. At about the fourth\r\nattempt, if it was to succeed at all, the floe would yield. A black,\r\nsinuous line, as though pen-drawn on white paper, would appear ahead,\r\nbroadening as the eye traced it back to the ship. Presently it would be\r\nbroad enough to receive her, and we would forge ahead. Under the bows\r\nand alongside, great slabs of ice were being turned over and slid back\r\non the floe, or driven down and under the ice or ship. In this way the\r\n_Endurance_ would split a 2-ft. to 3-ft. floe a square mile in extent.\r\nOccasionally the floe, although cracked across, would be so held by\r\nother floes that it would refuse to open wide, and so gradually would\r\nbring the ship to a standstill. We would then go astern for some\r\ndistance and again drive her full speed into the crack, till finally\r\nthe floe would yield to the repeated onslaughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nNEW LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first day of the New Year (January 1, 1915) was cloudy, with a\r\ngentle northerly breeze and occasional snow-squalls. The condition of\r\nthe pack improved in the evening, and after 8 p.m. we forged ahead\r\nrapidly through brittle young ice, easily broken by the ship. A few\r\nhours later a moderate gale came up from the east, with continuous\r\nsnow. After 4 a.m. on the 2nd we got into thick old pack-ice, showing\r\nsigns of heavy pressure. It was much hummocked, but large areas of open\r\nwater and long leads to the south-west continued until noon. The\r\nposition then was lat. 69° 49´ S., long. 15° 42´ W., and the run for\r\nthe twenty-four hours had been 124 miles S. 3° W. This was cheering.\r\n\r\nThe heavy pack blocked the way south after midday. It would have been\r\nalmost impossible to have pushed the ship into the ice, and in any case\r\nthe gale would have made such a proceeding highly dangerous. So we\r\ndodged along to the west and north, looking for a suitable opening\r\ntowards the south. The good run had given me hope of sighting the land\r\non the following day, and the delay was annoying. I was growing anxious\r\nto reach land on account of the dogs, which had not been able to get\r\nexercise for four weeks, and were becoming run down. We passed at least\r\ntwo hundred bergs during the day, and we noticed also large masses of\r\nhummocky bay-ice and ice-foot. One floe of bay-ice had black earth upon\r\nit, apparently basaltic in origin, and there was a large berg with a\r\nbroad band of yellowish brown right through it. The stain may have been\r\nvolcanic dust. Many of the bergs had quaint shapes. There was one that\r\nexactly resembled a large two-funnel liner, complete in silhouette\r\nexcept for smoke. Later in the day we found an opening in the pack and\r\nmade 9 miles to the south-west, but at 2 a.m. on January 3 the lead\r\nended in hummocky ice, impossible to penetrate. A moderate easterly\r\ngale had come up with snow-squalls, and we could not get a clear view\r\nin any direction. The hummocky ice did not offer a suitable anchorage\r\nfor the ship, and we were compelled to dodge up and down for ten hours\r\nbefore we were able to make fast to a small floe under the lee of a\r\nberg 120 ft. high. The berg broke the wind and saved us drifting fast\r\nto leeward. The position was lat. 69° 59´ S., long. 17° 31´ W. We made\r\na move again at 7 p.m., when we took in the ice-anchor and proceeded\r\nsouth, and at 10 p.m. we passed a small berg that the ship had nearly\r\ntouched twelve hours previously. Obviously we were not making much\r\nheadway. Several of the bergs passed during this day were of solid blue\r\nice, indicating true glacier origin.\r\n\r\nBy midnight of the 3rd we had made 11 miles to the south, and then came\r\nto a full stop in weather so thick with snow that we could not learn if\r\nthe leads and lanes were worth entering. The ice was hummocky, but,\r\nfortunately, the gale was decreasing, and after we had scanned all the\r\nleads and pools within our reach we turned back to the north-east. Two\r\nsperm and two large blue whales were sighted, the first we had seen for\r\n260 miles. We saw also petrels, numerous adelies, emperors,\r\ncrab-eaters, and sea-leopards. The clearer weather of the morning\r\nshowed us that the pack was solid and impassable from the south-east to\r\nthe south-west, and at 10 a.m. on the 4th we again passed within five\r\nyards of the small berg that we had passed twice on the previous day.\r\nWe had been steaming and dodging about over an area of twenty square\r\nmiles for fifty hours, trying to find an opening to the south,\r\nsouth-east, or south-west, but all the leads ran north, north-east, or\r\nnorth-west. It was as though the spirits of the Antarctic were pointing\r\nus to the backward track—the track we were determined not to follow.\r\nOur desire was to make easting as well as southing so as to reach the\r\nland, if possible, east of Ross’s farthest South and well east of\r\nCoats’ Land. This was more important as the prevailing winds appeared\r\nto be to easterly, and every mile of easting would count. In the\r\nafternoon we went west in some open water, and by 4 p.m. we were making\r\nwest-south-west with more water opening up ahead. The sun was shining\r\nbrightly, over three degrees high at midnight, and we were able to\r\nmaintain this direction in fine weather till the following noon. The\r\nposition then was lat. 70° 28´ S., long. 20° 16´ W., and the run had\r\nbeen 62 miles S. 62° W. At 8 a.m. there had been open water from north\r\nround by west to south-west, but impenetrable pack to the south and\r\neast. At 3 p.m. the way to the south-west and west-north-west was\r\nabsolutely blocked, and as we experienced a set to the west, I did not\r\nfeel justified in burning more of the reduced stock of coal to go west\r\nor north. I took the ship back over our course for four miles, to a\r\npoint where some looser pack gave faint promise of a way through; but,\r\nafter battling for three hours with very heavy hummocked ice and making\r\nfour miles to the south, we were brought up by huge blocks and floes of\r\nvery old pack. Further effort seemed useless at that time, and I gave\r\nthe order to bank fires after we had moored the _Endurance_ to a solid\r\nfloe. The weather was clear, and some enthusiastic football-players had\r\na game on the floe until, about midnight, Worsley dropped through a\r\nhole in rotten ice while retrieving the ball. He had to be retrieved\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nSolid pack still barred the way to the south on the following morning\r\n(January 6). There was some open water north of the floe, but as the\r\nday was calm and I did not wish to use coal in a possibly vain search\r\nfor an opening to the southward, I kept the ship moored to the floe.\r\nThis pause in good weather gave an opportunity to exercise the dogs,\r\nwhich were taken on to the floe by the men in charge of them. The\r\nexcitement of the animals was intense. Several managed to get into the\r\nwater, and the muzzles they were wearing did not prevent some hot\r\nfights. Two dogs which had contrived to slip their muzzles fought\r\nthemselves into an icy pool and were hauled out still locked in a\r\ngrapple. However, men and dogs enjoyed the exercise. A sounding gave a\r\ndepth of 2400 fathoms, with a blue mud bottom. The wind freshened from\r\nthe west early the next morning, and we started to skirt the northern\r\nedge of the solid pack in an easterly direction under sail. We had\r\ncleared the close pack by noon, but the outlook to the south gave small\r\npromise of useful progress, and I was anxious now to make easting. We\r\nwent north-east under sail, and after making thirty-nine miles passed a\r\npeculiar berg that we had been abreast of sixty hours earlier.\r\nKiller-whales were becoming active around us, and I had to exercise\r\ncaution in allowing any one to leave the ship. These beasts have a\r\nhabit of locating a resting seal by looking over the edge of a floe and\r\nthen striking through the ice from below in search of a meal; they\r\nwould not distinguish between seal and man.\r\n\r\nThe noon position on January 8 was lat. 70° 0´ S., long. 19° 09´ W. We\r\nhad made 66 miles in a north-easterly direction during the preceding\r\ntwenty-four hours. The course during the afternoon was east-south-east\r\nthrough loose pack and open water, with deep hummocky floes to the\r\nsouth. Several leads to the south came in view, but we held on the\r\neasterly course. The floes were becoming looser, and there were\r\nindications of open water ahead. The ship passed not fewer than five\r\nhundred bergs that day, some of them very large. A dark water-sky\r\nextended from east to south-south-east on the following morning, and\r\nthe _Endurance_, working through loose pack at half speed, reached open\r\nwater just before noon. A rampart berg 150 ft. high and a quarter of a\r\nmile long lay at the edge of the loose pack, and we sailed over a\r\nprojecting foot of this berg into rolling ocean, stretching to the\r\nhorizon. The sea extended from a little to the west of south, round by\r\neast to north-north-east, and its welcome promise was supported by a\r\ndeep water-sky to the south. I laid a course south by east in an\r\nendeavour to get south and east of Ross’s farthest south (lat. 71° 30´\r\nS.).\r\n\r\nWe kept the open water for a hundred miles, passing many bergs but\r\nencountering no pack. Two very large whales, probably blue whales, came\r\nup close to the ship, and we saw spouts in all directions. Open water\r\ninside the pack in that latitude might have the appeal of sanctuary to\r\nthe whales, which are harried by man farther north. The run southward\r\nin blue water, with a path clear ahead and the miles falling away\r\nbehind us, was a joyful experience after the long struggle through the\r\nice-lanes. But, like other good things, our spell of free movement had\r\nto end. The _Endurance_ encountered the ice again at 1 a.m. on the\r\n10th. Loose pack stretched to east and south, with open water to the\r\nwest and a good watersky. It consisted partly of heavy hummocky ice\r\nshowing evidence of great pressure, but contained also many thick, flat\r\nfloes evidently formed in some sheltered bay and never subjected to\r\npressure or to much motion. The swirl of the ship’s wash brought\r\ndiatomaceous scum from the sides of this ice. The water became thick\r\nwith _diatoms_ at 9 a.m., and I ordered a cast to be made. No bottom\r\nwas found at 210 fathoms. The _Endurance_ continued to advance\r\nsouthward through loose pack that morning. We saw the spouts of\r\nnumerous whales and noticed some hundreds of crab-eaters lying on the\r\nfloes. White-rumped terns, Antarctic petrels and snow petrels were\r\nnumerous, and there was a colony of adelies on a low berg. A few\r\nkiller-whales, with their characteristic high dorsal fin, also came in\r\nview. The noon position was lat. 72° 02´ S., long. 16° 07´ W., and the\r\nrun for the twenty-four hours had been 136 miles S. 6° E.\r\n\r\nWe were now in the vicinity of the land discovered by Dr. W. S. Bruce,\r\nleader of the _Scotia_ Expedition, in 1904, and named by him Coats’\r\nLand. Dr. Bruce encountered an ice-barrier in lat. 72° 18´ S., long.\r\n10° W., stretching from north-east to south-west. He followed the\r\nbarrier-edge to the south-west for 150 miles and reached lat. 74° 1´\r\nS., long. 22° W. He saw no naked rock, but his description of rising\r\nslopes of snow and ice, with shoaling water off the barrier-wall,\r\nindicated clearly the presence of land. It was up those slopes, at a\r\npoint as far south as possible, that I planned to begin the march\r\nacross the Antarctic continent. All hands were watching now for the\r\ncoast described by Dr. Bruce, and at 5 p.m. the look-out reported an\r\nappearance of land to the south-south-east. We could see a gentle\r\nsnow-slope rising to a height of about one thousand feet. It seemed to\r\nbe an island or a peninsula with a sound on its south side, and the\r\nposition of its most northerly point was about 72° 34´ S., 16° 40´ W.\r\nThe _Endurance_ was passing through heavy loose pack, and shortly\r\nbefore midnight she broke into a lead of open sea along a barrier-edge.\r\nA sounding within one cable’s length of the barrier-edge gave no bottom\r\nwith 210 fathoms of line. The barrier was 70 ft. high, with cliffs of\r\nabout 40 ft. The _Scotia_ must have passed this point when pushing to\r\nBruce’s farthest south on March 6, 1904, and I knew from the narrative\r\nof that voyage, as well as from our own observation, that the coast\r\ntrended away to the south-west. The lead of open water continued along\r\nthe barrier-edge, and we pushed forward without delay.\r\n\r\nAn easterly breeze brought cloud and falls of snow during the morning\r\nof January 11. The barrier trended south-west by south, and we skirted\r\nit for fifty miles until 11 am. The cliffs in the morning were 20 ft.\r\nhigh, and by noon they had increased to 110 and 115 ft. The brow\r\napparently rose 20 to 30 ft. higher. We were forced away from the\r\nbarrier once for three hours by a line of very heavy pack-ice.\r\nOtherwise there was open water along the edge, with high loose pack to\r\nthe west and north-west. We noticed a seal bobbing up and down in an\r\napparent effort to swallow a long silvery fish that projected at least\r\neighteen inches from its mouth. The noon position was lat. 73° 13´ S.,\r\nlong. 20° 43´ W., and a sounding then gave 155 fathoms at a distance of\r\na mile from the barrier. The bottom consisted of large igneous pebbles.\r\nThe weather then became thick, and I held away to the westward, where\r\nthe sky had given indications of open water, until 7 p.m., when we laid\r\nthe ship alongside a floe in loose pack. Heavy snow was falling, and I\r\nwas anxious lest the westerly wind should bring the pack hard against\r\nthe coast and jam the ship. The _Nimrod_ had a narrow escape from a\r\nmisadventure of this kind in the Ross Sea early in 1908.\r\n\r\nWe made a start again at 5 a.m. the next morning (January 12) in\r\novercast weather with mist and snow-showers, and four hours later broke\r\nthrough loose pack-ice into open water. The view was obscured, but we\r\nproceeded to the south-east and had gained 24 miles by noon, when three\r\nsoundings in lat. 74° 4´ S., long. 22° 48´ W. gave 95, 128, and 103\r\nfathoms, with a bottom of sand, pebbles, and mud. Clark got a good haul\r\nof biological specimens in the dredge. The _Endurance_ was now close to\r\nwhat appeared to be the barrier, with a heavy pack-ice foot containing\r\nnumerous bergs frozen in and possibly aground. The solid ice turned\r\naway towards the north-west, and we followed the edge for 48 miles N.\r\n60° W. to clear it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Midnight off the New Land]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: New Land: Caird Coast]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we were beyond the point reached by the _Scotia_, and the land\r\nunderlying the ice-sheet we were skirting was new. The northerly trend\r\nwas unexpected, and I began to suspect that we were really rounding a\r\nhuge ice-tongue attached to the true barrier-edge and extending\r\nnorthward. Events confirmed this suspicion. We skirted the pack all\r\nnight, steering north-west; then went west by north till 4 a.m. and\r\nround to south-west. The course at 8 a.m. on the 13th was\r\nsouth-south-west. The barrier at midnight was low and distant, and at 8\r\na.m. there was merely a narrow ice-foot about two hundred yards across\r\nseparating it from the open water. By noon there was only an occasional\r\nshelf of ice-foot. The barrier in one place came with an easy sweep to\r\nthe sea. We could have landed stores there without difficulty. We made\r\na sounding 400 ft. off the barrier but got no bottom at 676 fathoms. At\r\n4 p.m., still following the barrier to the south-west, we reached a\r\ncorner and found it receding abruptly to the south-east. Our way was\r\nblocked by very heavy pack, and after spending two hours in a vain\r\nsearch for an opening, we moored the _Endurance_ to a floe and banked\r\nfires. During that day we passed two schools of seals, swimming fast to\r\nthe north-west and north-north-east. The animals swam in close order,\r\nrising and blowing like porpoises, and we wondered if there was any\r\nsignificance in their journey northward at that time of the year.\r\nSeveral young emperor penguins had been captured and brought aboard on\r\nthe previous day. Two of them were still alive when the _Endurance_ was\r\nbrought alongside the floe. They promptly hopped on to the ice, turned\r\nround, bowed gracefully three times, and retired to the far side of the\r\nfloe. There is something curiously human about the manners and\r\nmovements of these birds. I was concerned about the dogs. They were\r\nlosing condition and some of them appeared to be ailing. One dog had to\r\nbe shot on the 12th. We did not move the ship on the 14th. A breeze\r\ncame from the east in the evening, and under its influence the pack\r\nbegan to work off shore. Before midnight the close ice that had barred\r\nour way had opened and left a lane along the foot of the barrier. I\r\ndecided to wait for the morning, not wishing to risk getting caught\r\nbetween the barrier and the pack in the event of the wind changing. A\r\nsounding gave 1357 fathoms, with a bottom of glacial mud. The noon\r\nobservation showed the position to be lat. 74° 09´ S., long. 27° 16´ W.\r\nWe cast off at 6 a.m. on the 15th in hazy weather with a north-easterly\r\nbreeze, and proceeded along the barrier in open water. The course was\r\nsouth-east for sixteen miles, then south-south-east. We now had solid\r\npack to windward, and at 3 p.m. we passed a bight probably ten miles\r\ndeep and running to the north-east. A similar bight appeared at 6 p.m.\r\nThese deep cuts strengthened the impression we had already formed that\r\nfor several days we had been rounding a great mass of ice, at least\r\nfifty miles across, stretching out from the coast and possibly destined\r\nto float away at some time in the future. The soundings—roughly, 200\r\nfathoms at the landward side and 1300 fathoms at the seaward\r\nside—suggested that this mighty projection was afloat. Seals were\r\nplentiful. We saw large numbers on the pack and several on low parts of\r\nthe barrier, where the slope was easy. The ship passed through large\r\nschools of seals swimming from the barrier to the pack off shore. The\r\nanimals were splashing and blowing around the _Endurance_, and Hurley\r\nmade a record of this unusual sight with the kinematograph-camera.\r\n\r\nThe barrier now stretched to the south-west again. Sail was set to a\r\nfresh easterly breeze, but at 7 p.m. it had to be furled, the\r\n_Endurance_ being held up by pack-ice against the barrier for an hour.\r\nWe took advantage of the pause to sound and got 268 fathoms with\r\nglacial mud and pebbles. Then a small lane appeared ahead. We pushed\r\nthrough at full speed, and by 8.30 p.m. the _Endurance_ was moving\r\nsouthward with sails set in a fine expanse of open water. We continued\r\nto skirt the barrier in clear weather. I was watching for possible\r\nlanding-places, though as a matter of fact I had no intention of\r\nlanding north of Vahsel Bay, in Luitpold Land, except under pressure of\r\nnecessity. Every mile gained towards the south meant a mile less\r\nsledging when the time came for the overland journey.\r\n\r\nShortly before midnight on the 15th we came abreast of the northern\r\nedge of a great glacier or overflow from the inland ice, projecting\r\nbeyond the barrier into the sea. It was 400 or 500 ft. high, and at its\r\nedge was a large mass of thick bay-ice. The bay formed by the northern\r\nedge of this glacier would have made an excellent landing-place. A flat\r\nice-foot nearly three feet above sea-level looked like a natural quay.\r\nFrom this ice-foot a snow-slope rose to the top of the barrier. The bay\r\nwas protected from the south-easterly wind and was open only to the\r\nnortherly wind, which is rare in those latitudes. A sounding gave 80\r\nfathoms, indicating that the glacier was aground. I named the place\r\nGlacier Bay, and had reason later to remember it with regret.\r\n\r\nThe _Endurance_ steamed along the front of this ice-flow for about\r\nseventeen miles. The glacier showed huge crevasses and high pressure\r\nridges, and appeared to run back to ice-covered slopes or hills 1000 or\r\n2000 ft. high. Some bays in its front were filled with smooth ice,\r\ndotted with seals and penguins. At 4 a.m. on the 16th we reached the\r\nedge of another huge glacial overflow from the ice-sheet. The ice\r\nappeared to be coming over low hills and was heavily broken. The\r\ncliff-face was 250 to 350 ft. high, and the ice surface two miles\r\ninland was probably 2000 ft. high. The cliff-front showed a tide-mark\r\nof about 6 ft., proving that it was not afloat. We steamed along the\r\nfront of this tremendous glacier for 40 miles and then, at 8.30 a.m.,\r\nwe were held up by solid pack-ice, which appeared to be held by\r\nstranded bergs. The depth, two cables off the barrier-cliff, was 134\r\nfathoms. No further advance was possible that day, but the noon\r\nobservation, which gave the position as lat. 76° 27´ S. long. 28° 51´\r\nW., showed that we had gained 124 miles to the south-west during the\r\npreceding twenty-four hours. The afternoon was not without incident.\r\nThe bergs in the neighbourhood were very large, several being over 200\r\nft. high, and some of them were firmly aground, showing tidemarks. A\r\nbarrier-berg bearing north-west appeared to be about 25 miles long. We\r\npushed the ship against a small banded berg, from which Wordie secured\r\nseveral large lumps of biotite granite. While the _Endurance_ was being\r\nheld slow ahead against the berg a loud crack was heard, and the\r\ngeologist had to scramble aboard at once. The bands on this berg were\r\nparticularly well defined; they were due to morainic action in the\r\nparent glacier. Later in the day the easterly wind increased to a gale.\r\nFragments of floe drifted past at about two knots, and the pack to\r\nleeward began to break up fast. A low berg of shallow draught drove\r\ndown into the grinding pack and, smashing against two larger stranded\r\nbergs, pushed them off the bank. The three went away together\r\npell-mell. We took shelter under the lee of a large stranded berg.\r\n\r\nA blizzard from the east-north-east prevented us leaving the shelter of\r\nthe berg on the following day (Sunday, January 17). The weather was\r\nclear, but the gale drove dense clouds of snow off the land and\r\nobscured the coast-line most of the time. “The land, seen when the air\r\nis clear, appears higher than we thought it yesterday; probably it\r\nrises to 3000 ft. above the head of the glacier. Caird Coast, as I have\r\nnamed it, connects Coats’ Land, discovered by Bruce in 1904, with\r\nLuitpold Land, discovered by Filchner in 1912. The northern part is\r\nsimilar in character to Coats’ Land. It is fronted by an undulating\r\nbarrier, the van of a mighty ice-sheet that is being forced outward\r\nfrom the high interior of the Antarctic Continent and apparently is\r\nsweeping over low hills, plains, and shallow seas as the great Arctic\r\nice-sheet once pressed over Northern Europe. The barrier surface, seen\r\nfrom the sea, is of a faint golden brown colour. It terminates usually\r\nin cliffs ranging from 10 to 300 ft. in height, but in a very few\r\nplaces sweeps down level with the sea. The cliffs are of dazzling\r\nwhiteness, with wonderful blue shadows. Far inland higher slopes can be\r\nseen, appearing like dim blue or faint golden fleecy clouds. These\r\ndistant slopes have increased in nearness and clearness as we have come\r\nto the south-west, while the barrier cliffs here are higher and\r\napparently firmer. We are now close to the junction with Luitpold Land.\r\nAt this southern end of the Caird Coast the ice-sheet, undulating over\r\nthe hidden and imprisoned land, is bursting down a steep slope in\r\ntremendous glaciers, bristling with ridges and spikes of ice and seamed\r\nby thousands of crevasses. Along the whole length of the coast we have\r\nseen no bare land or rock. Not as much as a solitary nunatak has\r\nappeared to relieve the surface of ice and snow. But the upward sweep\r\nof the ice-slopes towards the horizon and the ridges, terraces, and\r\ncrevasses that appear as the ice approaches the sea tell of the hills\r\nand valleys that lie below.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Close Under the Barrier]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trying to cut a way for the Ship through the Ice to a\r\nLead ahead (February 14, 1915)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Endurance_ lay under the lee of the stranded berg until 7 a.m. on\r\nJanuary 18. The gale had moderated by that time, and we proceeded under\r\nsail to the south-west through a lane that had opened along the\r\nglacier-front. We skirted the glacier till 9.30 a.m., when it ended in\r\ntwo bays, open to the north-west but sheltered by stranded bergs to the\r\nwest. The coast beyond trended south-south-west with a gentle\r\nland-slope.\r\n\r\n“The pack now forces us to go west 14 miles, when we break through a\r\nlong line of heavy brash mixed with large lumps and ‘growlers.’ We do\r\nthis under the fore-topsail only, the engines being stopped to protect\r\nthe propeller. This takes us into open water, where we make S. 50° W.\r\nfor 24 miles. Then we again encounter pack which forces us to the\r\nnorth-west for 10 miles, when we are brought up by heavy snow-lumps,\r\nbrash, and large, loose floes. The character of the pack shows change.\r\nThe floes are very thick and are covered by deep snow. The brash\r\nbetween the floes is so thick and heavy that we cannot push through\r\nwithout a great expenditure of power, and then for a short distance\r\nonly. We therefore lie to for a while to see if the pack opens at all\r\nwhen this north-east wind ceases.”\r\n\r\nOur position on the morning of the 19th was lat. 76° 34´ S., long. 31°\r\n30´ W. The weather was good, but no advance could be made. The ice had\r\nclosed around the ship during the night, and no water could be seen in\r\nany direction from the deck. A few lanes were in sight from the\r\nmast-head. We sounded in 312 fathoms, finding mud, sand, and pebbles.\r\nThe land showed faintly to the east. We waited for the conditions to\r\nimprove, and the scientists took the opportunity to dredge for\r\nbiological and geological specimens. During the night a moderate\r\nnorth-easterly gale sprang up, and a survey of the position on the 20th\r\nshowed that the ship was firmly beset. The ice was packed heavily and\r\nfirmly all round the _Endurance_ in every direction as far as the eye\r\ncould reach from the masthead. There was nothing to be done till the\r\nconditions changed, and we waited through that day and the succeeding\r\ndays with increasing anxiety. The east-north-easterly gale that had\r\nforced us to take shelter behind the stranded berg on the 16th had\r\nveered later to the north-east, and it continued with varying intensity\r\nuntil the 22nd. Apparently this wind had crowded the ice into the bight\r\nof the Weddell Sea, and the ship was now drifting south-west with the\r\nfloes which had enclosed it. A slight movement of the ice round the\r\nship caused the rudder to become dangerously jammed on the 21st, and we\r\nhad to cut away the ice with ice-chisels, heavy pieces of iron with\r\n6-ft. wooden hafts. We kept steam up in readiness for a move if the\r\nopportunity offered, and the engines running full speed ahead helped to\r\nclear the rudder. Land was in sight to the east and south about sixteen\r\nmiles distant on the 22nd. The land-ice seemed to be faced with\r\nice-cliffs at most points, but here and there slopes ran down to\r\nsea-level. Large crevassed areas in terraces parallel with the coast\r\nshowed where the ice was moving down over foot-hills. The inland ice\r\nappeared for the most part to be undulating, smooth, and easy to march\r\nover, but many crevasses might have been concealed from us by the\r\nsurface snow or by the absence of shadows. I thought that the land\r\nprobably rose to a height of 5000 ft. forty or fifty miles inland. The\r\naccurate estimation of heights and distances in the Antarctic is always\r\ndifficult, owing to the clear air, the confusing monotony of colouring,\r\nand the deceptive effect of mirage and refraction. The land appeared to\r\nincrease in height to the southward, where we saw a line of land or\r\nbarrier that must have been seventy miles, and possibly was even more\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nSunday, January 24, was a clear sunny day, with gentle easterly and\r\nsoutherly breezes. No open water could be seen from the mast-head, but\r\nthere was a slight water-sky to the west and north-west. “This is the\r\nfirst time for ten days that the wind has varied from north-east and\r\neast, and on five of these days it has risen to a gale. Evidently the\r\nice has become firmly packed in this quarter, and we must wait\r\npatiently till a southerly gale occurs or currents open the ice. We are\r\ndrifting slowly. The position to-day was 76° 49´ S., 33° 51´ W. Worsley\r\nand James, working on the floe with a Kew magnetometer, found the\r\nvariation to be six degrees west.” Just before midnight a crack\r\ndeveloped in the ice five yards wide and a mile long, fifty yards ahead\r\nof the ship. The crack had widened to a quarter of a mile by 10 a.m. on\r\nthe 25th, and for three hours we tried to force the ship into this\r\nopening with engines at full speed ahead and all sails set. The sole\r\neffect was to wash some ice away astern and clear the rudder, and after\r\nconvincing myself that the ship was firmly held I abandoned the\r\nattempt. Later in the day Crean and two other men were over the side on\r\na stage chipping at a large piece of ice that had got under the ship\r\nand appeared to be impeding her movement. The ice broke away suddenly,\r\nshot upward and overturned, pinning Crean between the stage and the\r\nhaft of the heavy 11-ft. iron pincher. He was in danger for a few\r\nmoments, but we got him clear, suffering merely from a few bad bruises.\r\nThe thick iron bar had been bent against him to an angle of 45 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe days that followed were uneventful. Moderate breezes from the east\r\nand south-west had no apparent effect upon the ice, and the ship\r\nremained firmly held. On the 27th, the tenth day of inactivity, I\r\ndecided to let the fires out. We had been burning half a ton of coal a\r\nday to keep steam in the boilers, and as the bunkers now contained only\r\n67 tons, representing thirty-three days’ steaming, we could not afford\r\nto continue this expenditure of fuel. Land still showed to the east and\r\nsouth when the horizon was clear. The biologist was securing some\r\ninteresting specimens with the hand-dredge at various depths. A\r\nsounding on the 26th gave 360 fathoms, and another on the 29th 449\r\nfathoms. The drift was to the west, and an observation on the 31st\r\n(Sunday) showed that the ship had made eight miles during the week.\r\nJames and Hudson rigged the wireless in the hope of hearing the monthly\r\nmessage from the Falkland Islands. This message would be due about 3.20\r\na.m. on the following morning, but James was doubtful about hearing\r\nanything with our small apparatus at a distance of 1630 miles from the\r\ndispatching station. We heard nothing, as a matter of fact, and later\r\nefforts were similarly unsuccessful. The conditions would have been\r\ndifficult even for a station of high power.\r\n\r\nWe were accumulating gradually a stock of seal meat during these days\r\nof waiting. Fresh meat for the dogs was needed, and seal-steaks and\r\nliver made a very welcome change from the ship’s rations aboard the\r\n_Endurance_. Four crab-eaters and three Weddells, over a ton of meat\r\nfor dog and man, fell to our guns on February 2, and all hands were\r\noccupied most of the day getting the carcasses back to the ship over\r\nthe rough ice. We rigged three sledges for man-haulage and brought the\r\nseals about two miles, the sledging parties being guided among the\r\nridges and pools by semaphore from the crow’s-nest. Two more seals were\r\nsighted on the far side of a big pool, but I did not allow them to be\r\npursued. Some of the ice was in a treacherous condition, with thin\r\nfilms hiding cracks and pools, and I did not wish to risk an accident.\r\n\r\nA crack about four miles long opened in the floe to the stern of the\r\nship on the 3rd. The narrow lane in front was still open, but the\r\nprevailing light breezes did not seem likely to produce any useful\r\nmovement in the ice. Early on the morning of the 5th a north-easterly\r\ngale sprang up, bringing overcast skies and thick snow. Soon the pack\r\nwas opening and closing without much loosening effect. At noon the ship\r\ngave a sudden start and heeled over three degrees. Immediately\r\nafterwards a crack ran from the bows to the lead ahead and another to\r\nthe lead astern. I thought it might be possible to reeve the ship\r\nthrough one of these leads towards open water, but we could see no\r\nwater through the thick snow; and before steam was raised, and while\r\nthe view was still obscured, the pack closed again. The northerly gale\r\nhad given place to light westerly breezes on the 6th. The pack seemed\r\nto be more solid than ever. It stretched almost unbroken to the horizon\r\nin every direction, and the situation was made worse by very low\r\ntemperatures in succeeding days. The temperature was down to zero on\r\nthe night of the 7th and was two degrees below zero on the 8th. This\r\ncold spell in midsummer was most unfortunate from our point of view,\r\nsince it cemented the pack and tightened the grip of the ice upon the\r\nship. The slow drift to the south-west continued, and we caught\r\noccasional glimpses of distant uplands on the eastern horizon. The\r\nposition on the 7th was lat. 76° 57´ S., long. 35° 7´ W. Soundings on\r\nthe 6th and 8th found glacial mud at 630 and 529 fathoms.\r\n\r\nThe _Endurance_ was lying in a pool covered by young ice on the 9th.\r\nThe solid floes had loosened their grip on the ship itself, but they\r\nwere packed tightly all around. The weather was foggy. We felt a slight\r\nnortherly swell coming through the pack, and the movement gave rise to\r\nhope that there was open water near to us. At 11 a.m. a long crack\r\ndeveloped in the pack, running east and west as far as we could see\r\nthrough the fog, and I ordered steam to be raised in the hope of being\r\nable to break away into this lead. The effort failed. We could break\r\nthe young ice in the pool, but the pack defied us. The attempt was\r\nrenewed on the 11th, a fine clear day with blue sky. The temperature\r\nwas still low, –2° Fahr. at midnight. After breaking through some young\r\nice the _Endurance_ became jammed against soft floe. The engines\r\nrunning full speed astern produced no effect until all hands joined in\r\n“sallying” ship. The dog-kennels amidships made it necessary for the\r\npeople to gather aft, where they rushed from side to side in a mass in\r\nthe confined space around the wheel. This was a ludicrous affair, the\r\nmen falling over one another amid shouts of laughter without producing\r\nmuch effect on the ship. She remained fast, while all hands jumped at\r\nthe word of command, but finally slid off when the men were stamping\r\nhard at the double. We were now in a position to take advantage of any\r\nopening that might appear. The ice was firm around us, and as there\r\nseemed small chance of making a move that day, I had the motor crawler\r\nand warper put out on the floe for a trial run. The motor worked most\r\nsuccessfully, running at about six miles an hour over slabs and ridges\r\nof ice hidden by a foot or two of soft snow. The surface was worse than\r\nwe would expect to face on land or barrier-ice. The motor warped itself\r\nback on a 500-fathom steel wire and was taken aboard again. “From the\r\nmast-head the mirage is continually giving us false alarms. Everything\r\nwears an aspect of unreality. Icebergs hang upside down in the sky; the\r\nland appears as layers of silvery or golden cloud. Cloud-banks look\r\nlike land, icebergs masquerade as islands or nunataks, and the distant\r\nbarrier to the south is thrown into view, although it really is outside\r\nour range of vision. Worst of all is the deceptive appearance of open\r\nwater, caused by the refraction of distant water, or by the sun shining\r\nat an angle on a field of smooth snow or the face of ice-cliffs below\r\nthe horizon.”\r\n\r\nThe second half of February produced no important change in our\r\nsituation. Early in the morning of the 14th I ordered a good head of\r\nsteam on the engines and sent all hands on to the floe with\r\nice-chisels, prickers, saws, and picks. We worked all day and\r\nthroughout most of the next day in a strenuous effort to get the ship\r\ninto the lead ahead. The men cut away the young ice before the bows and\r\npulled it aside with great energy. After twenty-four hours’ labour we\r\nhad got the ship a third of the way to the lead. But about 400 yards of\r\nheavy ice, including old rafted pack, still separated the _Endurance_\r\nfrom the water, and reluctantly I had to admit that further effort was\r\nuseless. Every opening we made froze up again quickly owing to the\r\nunseasonably low temperature. The young ice was elastic and prevented\r\nthe ship delivering a strong, splitting blow to the floe, while at the\r\nsame time it held the older ice against any movement. The abandonment\r\nof the attack was a great disappointment to all hands. The men had\r\nworked long hours without thought of rest, and they deserved success.\r\nBut the task was beyond our powers. I had not abandoned hope of getting\r\nclear, but was counting now on the possibility of having to spend a\r\nwinter in the inhospitable arms of the pack. The sun, which had been\r\nabove the horizon for two months, set at midnight on the 17th, and,\r\nalthough it would not disappear until April, its slanting rays warned\r\nus of the approach of winter. Pools and leads appeared occasionally,\r\nbut they froze over very quickly.\r\n\r\nWe continued to accumulate a supply of seal meat and blubber, and the\r\nexcursions across the floes to shoot and bring in the seals provided\r\nwelcome exercise for all hands. Three crab-eater cows shot on the 21st\r\nwere not accompanied by a bull, and blood was to be seen about the hole\r\nfrom which they had crawled. We surmised that the bull had become the\r\nprey of one of the killer-whales. These aggressive creatures were to be\r\nseen often in the lanes and pools, and we were always distrustful of\r\ntheir ability or willingness to discriminate between seal and man. A\r\nlizard-like head would show while the killer gazed along the floe with\r\nwicked eyes. Then the brute would dive, to come up a few moments later,\r\nperhaps, under some unfortunate seal reposing on the ice. Worsley\r\nexamined a spot where a killer had smashed a hole 8 ft. by 12 ft. in\r\n12½ in. of hard ice, covered by 2½ in. of snow. Big blocks of ice had\r\nbeen tossed on to the floe surface. Wordie, engaged in measuring the\r\nthickness of young ice, went through to his waist one day just as a\r\nkiller rose to blow in the adjacent lead. His companions pulled him out\r\nhurriedly.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd the _Endurance_ reached the farthest south point of her\r\ndrift, touching the 77th parallel of latitude in long. 35° W. The\r\nsummer had gone; indeed the summer had scarcely been with us at all.\r\nThe temperatures were low day and night, and the pack was freezing\r\nsolidly around the ship. The thermometer recorded 10° below zero Fahr.\r\nat 2 a.m. on the 22nd. Some hours earlier we had watched a wonderful\r\ngolden mist to the southward, where the rays of the declining sun shone\r\nthrough vapour rising from the ice. All normal standards of perspective\r\nvanish under such conditions, and the low ridges of the pack, with mist\r\nlying between them, gave the illusion of a wilderness of mountain-peaks\r\nlike the Bernese Oberland. I could not doubt now that the _Endurance_\r\nwas confined for the winter. Gentle breezes from the east, south, and\r\nsouth-west did not disturb the hardening floes. The seals were\r\ndisappearing and the birds were leaving us. The land showed still in\r\nfair weather on the distant horizon, but it was beyond our reach now,\r\nand regrets for havens that lay behind us were vain.\r\n\r\n“We must wait for the spring, which may bring us better fortune. If I\r\nhad guessed a month ago that the ice would grip us here, I would have\r\nestablished our base at one of the landing-places at the great glacier.\r\nBut there seemed no reason to anticipate then that the fates would\r\nprove unkind. This calm weather with intense cold in a summer month is\r\nsurely exceptional. My chief anxiety is the drift. Where will the\r\nvagrant winds and currents carry the ship during the long winter months\r\nthat are ahead of us? We will go west, no doubt, but how far? And will\r\nit be possible to break out of the pack early in the spring and reach\r\nVahsel Bay or some other suitable landing-place? These are momentous\r\nquestions for us.”\r\n\r\nOn February 24 we ceased to observe ship routine, and the _Endurance_\r\nbecame a winter station. All hands were on duty during the day and\r\nslept at night, except a watchman who looked after the dogs and watched\r\nfor any sign of movement in the ice. We cleared a space of 10 ft. by 20\r\nft. round the rudder and propeller, sawing through ice 2 ft. thick, and\r\nlifting the blocks with a pair of tongs made by the carpenter. Crean\r\nused the blocks to make an ice-house for the dog Sally, which had added\r\na little litter of pups to the strength of the expedition. Seals\r\nappeared occasionally, and we killed all that came within our reach.\r\nThey represented fuel as well as food for men and dogs. Orders were\r\ngiven for the after-hold to be cleared and the stores checked, so that\r\nwe might know exactly how we stood for a siege by an Antarctic winter.\r\nThe dogs went off the ship on the following day. Their kennels were\r\nplaced on the floe along the length of a wire rope to which the leashes\r\nwere fastened. The dogs seemed heartily glad to leave the ship, and\r\nyelped loudly and joyously as they were moved to their new quarters. We\r\nhad begun the training of teams, and already there was keen rivalry\r\nbetween the drivers. The flat floes and frozen leads in the\r\nneighbourhood of the ship made excellent training grounds. Hockey and\r\nfootball on the floe were our chief recreations, and all hands joined\r\nin many a strenuous game.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Night Watchman’s Story]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Dying Sun: The _Endurance_ firmly frozen in]\r\n\r\n\r\nWorsley took a party to the floe on the 26th and started building a\r\nline of igloos and “dogloos” round the ship. These little buildings\r\nwere constructed, Esquimaux fashion, of big blocks of ice, with thin\r\nsheets for the roofs. Boards or frozen sealskins were placed over all,\r\nsnow was piled on top and pressed into the joints, and then water was\r\nthrown over the structures to make everything firm. The ice was packed\r\ndown flat inside and covered with snow for the dogs, which preferred,\r\nhowever, to sleep outside except when the weather was extraordinarily\r\nsevere. The tethering of the dogs was a simple matter. The end of a\r\nchain was buried about eight inches in the snow, some fragments of ice\r\nwere pressed around it, and a little water poured over all. The icy\r\nbreath of the Antarctic cemented it in a few moments. Four dogs which\r\nhad been ailing were shot. Some of the dogs were suffering badly from\r\nworms, and the remedies at our disposal, unfortunately, were not\r\neffective. All the fit dogs were being exercised in the sledges, and\r\nthey took to the work with enthusiasm. Sometimes their eagerness to be\r\noff and away produced laughable results, but the drivers learned to be\r\nalert. The wireless apparatus was still rigged, but we listened in vain\r\nfor the Saturday-night time signals from New Year Island, ordered for\r\nour benefit by the Argentine Government. On Sunday the 28th, Hudson\r\nwaited at 2 a.m. for the Port Stanley monthly signals, but could hear\r\nnothing. Evidently the distances were too great for our small plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nWINTER MONTHS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe month of March opened with a severe north-easterly gale. Five\r\nWeddells and two crab-eaters were shot on the floe during the morning\r\nof March 1, and the wind, with fine drifting snow, sprang up while the\r\ncarcasses were being brought in by sledging parties. The men were\r\ncompelled to abandon some of the blubber and meat, and they had a\r\nstruggle to get back to the ship over the rough ice in the teeth of the\r\nstorm. This gale continued until the 3rd, and all hands were employed\r\nclearing out the ’tween decks, which was to be converted into a living-\r\nand dining-room for officers and scientists. The carpenter erected in\r\nthis room the stove that had been intended for use in the shore hut,\r\nand the quarters were made very snug. The dogs appeared indifferent to\r\nthe blizzard. They emerged occasionally from the drift to shake\r\nthemselves and bark, but were content most of the time to lie, curled\r\ninto tight balls, under the snow. One of the old dogs, Saint, died on\r\nthe night of the 2nd, and the doctors reported that the cause of death\r\nwas appendicitis.\r\n\r\nWhen the gale cleared we found that the pack had been driven in from\r\nthe north-east and was now more firmly consolidated than before. A new\r\nberg, probably fifteen miles in length, had appeared on the northern\r\nhorizon. The bergs within our circle of vision had all become familiar\r\nobjects, and we had names for some of them. Apparently they were all\r\ndrifting with the pack. The sighting of a new berg was of more than\r\npassing interest, since in that comparatively shallow sea it would be\r\npossible for a big berg to become stranded. Then the island of ice\r\nwould be a centre of tremendous pressure and disturbance amid the\r\ndrifting pack. We had seen something already of the smashing effect of\r\na contest between berg and floe, and had no wish to have the helpless\r\n_Endurance_ involved in such a battle of giants. During the 3rd the\r\nseal meat and blubber was re-stowed on hummocks around the ship. The\r\nfrozen masses had been sinking into the floe. Ice, though hard and\r\nsolid to the touch, is never firm against heavy weights. An article\r\nleft on the floe for any length of time is likely to sink into the\r\nsurface-ice. Then the salt water will percolate through and the article\r\nwill become frozen into the body of the floe.\r\n\r\nClear weather followed the gale, and we had a series of mock suns and\r\nparhelia. Minus temperatures were the rule, 21° below zero Fahr. being\r\nrecorded on the 6th. We made mattresses for the dogs by stuffing sacks\r\nwith straw and rubbish, and most of the animals were glad to receive\r\nthis furnishing in their kennels. Some of them had suffered through the\r\nsnow melting with the heat of their bodies and then freezing solid. The\r\nscientific members of the expedition were all busy by this time. The\r\nmeteorologist had got his recording station, containing anemometer,\r\nbarograph, and thermograph, rigged over the stern. The geologist was\r\nmaking the best of what to him was an unhappy situation; but was not\r\naltogether without material. The pebbles found in the penguins were\r\noften of considerable interest, and some fragments of rock were brought\r\nup from the sea floor with the sounding-lead and the drag-net. On the\r\n7th Wordie and Worsley found some small pebbles, a piece of moss, a\r\nperfect bivalve shell, and some dust on a berg fragment, and brought\r\ntheir treasure-trove proudly to the ship. Clark was using the drag-net\r\nfrequently in the leads and secured good hauls of _plankton_, with\r\noccasional specimens of greater scientific interest. Seals were not\r\nplentiful, but our store of meat and blubber grew gradually. All hands\r\nate seal meat with relish and would not have cared to become dependent\r\non the ship’s tinned meat. We preferred the crab-eater to the Weddell,\r\nwhich is a very sluggish beast. The crab-eater seemed cleaner and\r\nhealthier. The killer-whales were still with us. On the 8th we examined\r\na spot where the floe-ice had been smashed up by a blow from beneath,\r\ndelivered presumably by a large whale in search of a breathing-place.\r\nThe force that had been exercised was astonishing. Slabs of ice 3 ft.\r\nthick, and weighing tons, had been tented upwards over a circular area\r\nwith a diameter of about 25 ft., and cracks radiated outwards for more\r\nthan 20 ft.\r\n\r\nThe quarters in the ’tween decks were completed by the 10th, and the\r\nmen took possession of the cubicles that had been built. The largest\r\ncubicle contained Macklin, McIlroy, Hurley, and Hussey and it was named\r\n“The Billabong.” Clark and Wordie lived opposite in a room called “Auld\r\nReekie.” Next came the abode of “The Nuts” or engineers, followed by\r\n“The Sailors’ Rest,” inhabited by Cheetham and McNeish. “The Anchorage”\r\nand “The Fumarole” were on the other side. The new quarters became\r\nknown as “The Ritz,” and meals were served there instead of in the ward\r\nroom. Breakfast was at 9 a.m., lunch at 1 p.m., tea at 4 p.m., and\r\ndinner at 6 p.m. Wild, Marston, Crean, and Worsley established\r\nthemselves in cubicles in the wardroom, and by the middle of the month\r\nall hands had settled down to the winter routine. I lived alone aft.\r\n\r\nWorsley, Hurley, and Wordie made a journey to a big berg, called by us\r\nthe Rampart Berg, on the 11th. The distance out was 7½ miles, and the\r\nparty covered a total distance of about 17 miles. Hurley took some\r\nphotographs and Wordie came back rejoicing with a little dust and some\r\nmoss.\r\n\r\n“Within a radius of one mile round the berg there is thin young ice,\r\nstrong enough to march over with care,” wrote Worsley. “The area of\r\ndangerous pressure, as regards a ship, does not seem to extend for more\r\nthan a quarter of a mile from the berg. Here there are cracks and\r\nconstant slight movement, which becomes exciting to the traveller when\r\nhe feels a piece of ice gradually upending beneath his feet. Close to\r\nthe berg the pressure makes all sorts of quaint noises. We heard\r\ntapping as from a hammer, grunts, groans and squeaks, electric trams\r\nrunning, birds singing, kettles boiling noisily, and an occasional\r\nswish as a large piece of ice, released from pressure, suddenly jumped\r\nor turned over. We noticed all sorts of quaint effects, such as huge\r\nbubbles or domes of ice, 40 ft. across and 4 or 5 ft. high. Large\r\nsinuous pancake-sheets were spread over the floe in places, and in one\r\nspot we counted five such sheets, each about 2½ in. thick, imbricated\r\nunder one another. They look as though made of barley-sugar and are\r\nvery slippery.”\r\n\r\nThe noon position on the 14th was lat. 76° 54´ S., long. 36° 10´ W. The\r\nland was visible faintly to the south-east, distant about 36 miles. A\r\nfew small leads could be seen from the ship, but the ice was firm in\r\nour neighbourhood. The drift of the _Endurance_ was still towards the\r\nnorth-west.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Rampart Berg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Bi-Weekly Performance: Scrubbing out the “Ritz”]\r\n\r\n\r\nI had the boilers blown down on the 15th, and the consumption of 2 cwt.\r\nof coal per day to keep the boilers from freezing then ceased. The\r\nbunkers still contained 52 tons of coal, and the daily consumption in\r\nthe stoves was about 2½ cwt. There would not be much coal left for\r\nsteaming purposes in the spring, but I anticipated eking out the supply\r\nwith blubber. A moderate gale from the north-east on the 17th brought\r\nfine, penetrating snow. The weather cleared in the evening, and a\r\nbeautiful crimson sunset held our eyes. At the same time the ice-cliffs\r\nof the land were thrown up in the sky by mirage, with an apparent\r\nreflection in open water, though the land itself could not be seen\r\ndefinitely. The effect was repeated in an exaggerated form on the\r\nfollowing day, when the ice-cliffs were thrown up above the horizon in\r\ndouble and treble parallel lines, some inverted. The mirage was due\r\nprobably to lanes of open water near the land. The water would be about\r\n30° warmer than the air and would cause warmed strata to ascend. A\r\nsounding gave 606 fathoms, with a bottom of glacial mud. Six days\r\nlater, on the 24th, the depth was 419 fathoms. We were drifting\r\nsteadily, and the constant movement, coupled with the appearance of\r\nlanes near the land, convinced me that we must stay by the ship till\r\nshe got clear. I had considered the possibility of making a landing\r\nacross the ice in the spring, but the hazards of such an undertaking\r\nwould be too great.\r\n\r\nThe training of the dogs in sledge teams was making progress. The\r\norders used by the drivers were “Mush” (Go on), “Gee” (Right), “Haw”\r\n(Left), and “Whoa” (Stop). These are the words that the Canadian\r\ndrivers long ago adopted, borrowing them originally from England. There\r\nwere many fights at first, until the dogs learned their positions and\r\ntheir duties, but as days passed drivers and teams became efficient.\r\nEach team had its leader, and efficiency depended largely on the\r\nwillingness and ability of this dog to punish skulking and\r\ndisobedience. We learned not to interfere unless the disciplinary\r\nmeasures threatened to have a fatal termination. The drivers could sit\r\non the sledge and jog along at ease if they chose. But the prevailing\r\nminus temperatures made riding unpopular, and the men preferred usually\r\nto run or walk alongside the teams. We were still losing dogs through\r\nsickness, due to stomach and intestinal worms.\r\n\r\nDredging for specimens at various depths was one of the duties during\r\nthese days. The dredge and several hundred fathoms of wire line made a\r\nheavy load, far beyond the unaided strength of the scientists. On the\r\n23rd, for example, we put down a 2 ft. dredge and 650 fathoms of wire.\r\nThe dredge was hove in four hours later and brought much glacial mud,\r\nseveral pebbles and rock fragments, three sponges, some worms,\r\n_brachiapods_, and _foraminiferæ_. The mud was troublesome. It was\r\nheavy to lift, and as it froze rapidly when brought to the surface, the\r\nrecovery of the specimens embedded in it was difficult. A haul made on\r\nthe 26th brought a prize for the geologist in the form of a lump of\r\nsandstone weighing 75 lbs., a piece of fossiliferous limestone, a\r\nfragment of striated shale, sandstone-grit, and some pebbles. Hauling\r\nin the dredge by hand was severe work, and on the 24th we used the\r\nGirling tractor-motor, which brought in 500 fathoms of line in thirty\r\nminutes, including stops. One stop was due to water having run over the\r\nfriction gear and frozen. It was a day or two later that we heard a\r\ngreat yell from the floe and found Clark dancing about and shouting\r\nScottish war-cries. He had secured his first complete specimen of an\r\nAntarctic fish, apparently a new species.\r\n\r\nMirages were frequent. Barrier-cliffs appeared all around us on the\r\n29th, even in places where we knew there was deep water.\r\n\r\n“Bergs and pack are thrown up in the sky and distorted into the most\r\nfantastic shapes. They climb, trembling, upwards, spreading out into\r\nlong lines at different levels, then contract and fall down, leaving\r\nnothing but an uncertain, wavering smudge which comes and goes.\r\nPresently the smudge swells and grows, taking shape until it presents\r\nthe perfect inverted reflection of a berg on the horizon, the shadow\r\nhovering over the substance. More smudges appear at different points on\r\nthe horizon. These spread out into long lines till they meet, and we\r\nare girdled by lines of shining snow-cliffs, laved at their bases by\r\nwaters of illusion in which they appear to be faithfully reflected. So\r\nthe shadows come and go silently, melting away finally as the sun\r\ndeclines to the west. We seem to be drifting helplessly in a strange\r\nworld of unreality. It is reassuring to feel the ship beneath one’s\r\nfeet and to look down at the familiar line of kennels and igloos on the\r\nsolid floe.”\r\n\r\nThe floe was not so solid as it appeared. We had reminders occasionally\r\nthat the greedy sea was very close, and that the floe was but a\r\ntreacherous friend, which might open suddenly beneath us. Towards the\r\nend of the month I had our store of seal meat and blubber brought\r\naboard. The depth as recorded by a sounding on the last day of March\r\nwas 256 fathoms. The continuous shoaling from 606 fathoms in a drift of\r\n39 miles N. 26° W. in thirty days was interesting. The sea shoaled as\r\nwe went north, either to east or to west, and the fact suggested that\r\nthe contour-lines ran east and west, roughly. Our total drift between\r\nJanuary 19, when the ship was frozen in, and March 31, a period of\r\nseventy-one days, had been 95 miles in a N. 80° W. direction. The\r\nicebergs around us had not changed their relative positions.\r\n\r\nThe sun sank lower in the sky, the temperatures became lower, and the\r\n_Endurance_ felt the grip of the icy hand of winter. Two north-easterly\r\ngales in the early part of April assisted to consolidate the pack. The\r\nyoung ice was thickening rapidly, and though leads were visible\r\noccasionally from the ship, no opening of a considerable size appeared\r\nin our neighbourhood. In the early morning of April 1 we listened again\r\nfor the wireless signals from Port Stanley. The crew had lashed three\r\n20-ft. rickers to the mast-heads in order to increase the spread of our\r\naerials, but still we failed to hear anything. The rickers had to come\r\ndown subsequently, since we found that the gear could not carry the\r\naccumulating weight of rime. Soundings proved that the sea continued to\r\nshoal as the _Endurance_ drifted to the north-west. The depth on April\r\n2 was 262 fathoms, with a bottom of glacial mud. Four weeks later a\r\nsounding gave 172 fathoms. The presence of grit in the bottom samples\r\ntowards the end of the month suggested that we were approaching land\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe month was not uneventful. During the night of the 3rd we heard the\r\nice grinding to the eastward, and in the morning we saw that young ice\r\nwas rafted 8 to 10 ft. high in places. This was the first murmur of the\r\ndanger that was to reach menacing proportions in later months. The ice\r\nwas heard grinding and creaking during the 4th and the ship vibrated\r\nslightly. The movement of the floe was sufficiently pronounced to\r\ninterfere with the magnetic work. I gave orders that accumulations of\r\nsnow, ice, and rubbish alongside the _Endurance_ should be shovelled\r\naway, so that in case of pressure there would be no weight against the\r\ntopsides to check the ship rising above the ice. All hands were busy\r\nwith pick and shovel during the day, and moved many tons of material.\r\nAgain, on the 9th, there were signs of pressure. Young ice was piled up\r\nto a height of 11 ft. astern of the ship, and the old floe was cracked\r\nin places. The movement was not serious, but I realized that it might\r\nbe the beginning of trouble for the Expedition. We brought certain\r\nstores aboard and provided space on deck for the dogs in case they had\r\nto be removed from the floe at short notice. We had run a 500-fathom\r\nsteel wire round the ship, snow-huts, and kennels, with a loop out to\r\nthe lead ahead, where the dredge was used. This wire was supported on\r\nice-pillars, and it served as a guide in bad weather when the view was\r\nobscured by driving snow and a man might have lost himself altogether.\r\nI had this wire cut in five places, since otherwise it might have been\r\ndragged across our section of the floe with damaging effect in the\r\nevent of the ice splitting suddenly.\r\n\r\nThe dogs had been divided into six teams of nine dogs each. Wild,\r\nCrean, Macklin, McIlroy, Marston, and Hurley each had charge of a team,\r\nand were fully responsible for the exercising, training, and feeding of\r\ntheir own dogs. They called in one of the surgeons when an animal was\r\nsick. We were still losing some dogs through worms, and it was\r\nunfortunate that the doctors had not the proper remedies. Worm-powders\r\nwere to have been provided by the expert Canadian dog-driver I had\r\nengaged before sailing for the south, and when this man did not join\r\nthe Expedition the matter was overlooked. We had fifty-four dogs and\r\neight pups early in April, but several were ailing, and the number of\r\nmature dogs was reduced to fifty by the end of the month. Our store of\r\nseal meat amounted now to about 5000 lbs., and I calculated that we had\r\nenough meat and blubber to feed the dogs for ninety days without\r\ntrenching upon the sledging rations. The teams were working well, often\r\nwith heavy loads. The biggest dog was Hercules, who tipped the beam at\r\n86 lbs. Samson was 11 lbs. lighter, but he justified his name one day\r\nby starting off at a smart pace with a sledge carrying 200 lbs. of\r\nblubber and a driver.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pylon Avenue]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Long, Long Night]\r\n\r\n\r\nA new berg that was going to give us some cause for anxiety made its\r\nappearance on the 14th. It was a big berg, and we noticed as it lay on\r\nthe north-west horizon that it had a hummocky, crevassed appearance at\r\nthe east end. During the day this berg increased its apparent altitude\r\nand changed its bearing slightly. Evidently it was aground and was\r\nholding its position against the drifting pack. A sounding at 11 a.m.\r\ngave 197 fathoms, with a hard stony or rocky bottom. During the next\r\ntwenty-four hours the _Endurance_ moved steadily towards the crevassed\r\nberg, which doubled its altitude in that time. We could see from the\r\nmast-head that the pack was piling and rafting against the mass of ice,\r\nand it was easy to imagine what would be the fate of the ship if she\r\nentered the area of disturbance. She would be crushed like an egg-shell\r\namid the shattering masses.\r\n\r\nWorsley was in the crow’s-nest on the evening of the 15th, watching for\r\nsigns of land to the westward, and he reported an interesting\r\nphenomenon. The sun set amid a glow of prismatic colours on a line of\r\nclouds just above the horizon. A minute later Worsley saw a golden\r\nglow, which expanded as he watched it, and presently the sun appeared\r\nagain and rose a semi-diameter clear above the western horizon. He\r\nhailed Crean, who from a position on the floe 90 ft. below the\r\ncrow’s-nest also saw the re-born sun. A quarter of an hour later from\r\nthe deck Worsley saw the sun set a second time. This strange phenomenon\r\nwas due to mirage or refraction. We attributed it to an ice-crack to\r\nthe westward, where the band of open water had heated a stratum of air.\r\n\r\nThe drift of the pack was not constant, and during the succeeding days\r\nthe crevassed berg alternately advanced and receded as the _Endurance_\r\nmoved with the floe. On Sunday, April 18, it was only seven miles\r\ndistant from the ship.\r\n\r\n“It is a large berg, about three-quarters of a mile long on the side\r\npresented to us and probably well over 200 ft. high. It is heavily\r\ncrevassed, as though it once formed the serac portion of a glacier. Two\r\nspecially wide and deep chasms across it from south-east to north-west\r\ngive it the appearance of having broken its back on the shoal-ground.\r\nHuge masses of pressure-ice are piled against its cliffs to a height of\r\nabout 60 ft., showing the stupendous force that is being brought to\r\nbear upon it by the drifting pack. The berg must be very firmly\r\naground. We swing the arrow on the current-meter frequently and watch\r\nwith keen attention to see where it will come to rest. Will it point\r\nstraight for the berg, showing that our drift is in that direction? It\r\nswings slowly round. It points to the north-east end of the berg, then\r\nshifts slowly to the centre and seems to stop; but it moves again and\r\nswings 20 degrees clear of our enemy to the south-west.... We notice\r\nthat two familiar bergs, the Rampart Berg and the Peak Berg, have moved\r\naway from the ship. Probably they also have grounded or dragged on the\r\nshoal.”\r\n\r\nA strong drift to the westward during the night of the 18th relieved\r\nour anxiety by carrying the _Endurance_ to the lee of the crevassed\r\nberg, which passed out of our range of vision before the end of the\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nWe said good-bye to the sun on May 1 and entered the period of twilight\r\nthat would be followed by the darkness of midwinter. The sun by the aid\r\nof refraction just cleared the horizon at noon and set shortly before 2\r\np.m. A fine aurora in the evening was dimmed by the full moon, which\r\nhad risen on April 27 and would not set again until May 6. The\r\ndisappearance of the sun is apt to be a depressing event in the polar\r\nregions, where the long months of darkness involve mental as well as\r\nphysical strain. But the _Endurance’s_ company refused to abandon their\r\ncustomary cheerfulness, and a concert in the evening made the Ritz a\r\nscene of noisy merriment, in strange contrast with the cold, silent\r\nworld that lay outside. “One feels our helplessness as the long winter\r\nnight closes upon us. By this time, if fortune had smiled upon the\r\nExpedition, we would have been comfortably and securely established in\r\na shore base, with depots laid to the south and plans made for the long\r\nmarch in the spring and summer. Where will we make a landing now? It is\r\nnot easy to forecast the future. The ice may open in the spring, but by\r\nthat time we will be far to the north-west. I do not think we shall be\r\nable to work back to Vahsel Bay. There are possible landing-places on\r\nthe western coast of the Weddell Sea, but can we reach any suitable\r\nspot early enough to attempt the overland journey next year? Time alone\r\nwill tell. I do not think any member of the Expedition is disheartened\r\nby our disappointment. All hands are cheery and busy, and will do their\r\nbest when the time for action comes. In the meantime we must wait.”\r\n\r\nThe ship’s position on Sunday, May 2, was lat. 75° 23´ S., long. 42°\r\n14´ W. The temperature at noon was 5° below zero Fahr., and the sky was\r\novercast. A seal was sighted from the mast-head at lunch-time, and five\r\nmen, with two dog teams, set off after the prize. They had an\r\nuncomfortable journey outward in the dim, diffused light, which cast no\r\nshadows and so gave no warning of irregularities in the white surface.\r\nIt is a strange sensation to be running along on apparently smooth snow\r\nand to fall suddenly into an unseen hollow, or bump against a ridge.\r\n\r\n“After going out three miles to the eastward,” wrote Worsley in\r\ndescribing this seal-hunt, “we range up and down but find nothing,\r\nuntil from a hummock I fancy I see something apparently a mile away,\r\nbut probably little more than half that distance. I ran for it, found\r\nthe seal, and with a shout brought up the others at the double. The\r\nseal was a big Weddell, over 10 ft. long and weighing more than 800\r\nlbs. But Soldier, one of the team leaders, went for its throat without\r\na moment’s hesitation, and we had to beat off the dogs before we could\r\nshoot the seal. We caught five or six gallons of blood in a tin for the\r\ndogs, and let the teams have a drink of fresh blood from the seal. The\r\nlight was worse than ever on our return, and we arrived back in the\r\ndark. Sir Ernest met us with a lantern and guided us into the lead\r\nastern and thence to the ship.”\r\n\r\nThis was the first seal we had secured since March 19, and the meat and\r\nblubber made a welcome addition to the stores.\r\n\r\nThree emperor penguins made their appearance in a lead west of the ship\r\non May 3. They pushed their heads through the young ice while two of\r\nthe men were standing by the lead. The men imitated the emperor’s call\r\nand walked slowly, penguin fashion, away from the lead. The birds in\r\nsuccession made a magnificent leap 3 ft. clear from the water on to the\r\nyoung ice. Thence they tobogganed to the bank and followed the men away\r\nfrom the lead. Their retreat was soon cut off by a line of men.\r\n\r\n“We walk up to them, talking loudly and assuming a threatening aspect.\r\nNotwithstanding our bad manners, the three birds turn towards us,\r\nbowing ceremoniously. Then, after a closer inspection, they conclude\r\nthat we are undesirable acquaintances and make off across the floe. We\r\nhead them off and finally shepherd them close to the ship, where the\r\nfrenzied barking of the dogs so frightens them that they make a\r\ndetermined effort to break through the line. We seize them. One bird of\r\nphilosophic mien goes quietly, led by one flipper. The others show\r\nfight, but all are imprisoned in an igloo for the night.... In the\r\nafternoon we see five emperors in the western lead and capture one.\r\nKerr and Cheetham fight a valiant action with two large birds. Kerr\r\nrushes at one, seizes it, and is promptly knocked down by the angered\r\npenguin, which jumps on his chest before retiring. Cheetham comes to\r\nKerr’s assistance; and between them they seize another penguin, bind\r\nhis bill and lead him, muttering muffled protests, to the ship like an\r\ninebriated old man between two policemen. He weighs 85 lbs., or 5 lbs.\r\nless than the heaviest emperor captured previously. Kerr and Cheetham\r\ninsist that he is nothing to the big fellow who escaped them.”\r\n\r\nThis penguin’s stomach proved to be filled with freshly caught fish up\r\nto 10 in. long. Some of the fish were of a coastal or littoral variety.\r\nTwo more emperors were captured on the following day, and, while Wordie\r\nwas leading one of them towards the ship, Wild came along with his\r\nteam. The dogs, uncontrollable in a moment, made a frantic rush for the\r\nbird, and were almost upon him when their harness caught upon an\r\nice-pylon, which they had tried to pass on both sides at once. The\r\nresult was a seething tangle of dogs, traces, and men, and an\r\noverturned sled, while the penguin, three yards away, nonchalantly and\r\nindifferently surveyed the disturbance. He had never seen anything of\r\nthe kind before and had no idea at all that the strange disorder might\r\nconcern him. Several cracks had opened in the neighbourhood of the\r\nship, and the emperor penguins, fat and glossy of plumage, were\r\nappearing in considerable numbers. We secured nine of them on May 6, an\r\nimportant addition to our supply of fresh food.\r\n\r\nThe sun, which had made “positively his last appearance” seven days\r\nearlier, surprised us by lifting more than half its disk above the\r\nhorizon on May 8. A glow on the northern horizon resolved itself into\r\nthe sun at 11 a.m. that day. A quarter of an hour later the\r\nunseasonable visitor disappeared again, only to rise again at 11.40\r\na.m., set at 1 p.m., rise at 1.10 p.m., and set lingeringly at 1.20\r\np.m. These curious phenomena were due to refraction, which amounted to\r\n2° 37´ at 1.20 p.m. The temperature was 15° below zero Fahr. and we\r\ncalculated that the refraction was 2° above normal. In other words, the\r\nsun was visible 120 miles farther south than the refraction tables gave\r\nit any right to be. The navigating officer naturally was aggrieved. He\r\nhad informed all hands on May 1 that they would not see the sun again\r\nfor seventy days, and now had to endure the jeers of friends who\r\naffected to believe that his observations were inaccurate by a few\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nThe _Endurance_ was drifting north-north-east under the influence of a\r\nsuccession of westerly and south-westerly breezes. The ship’s head, at\r\nthe same time, swung gradually to the left, indicating that the floe in\r\nwhich she was held was turning. During the night of the 14th a very\r\npronounced swing occurred, and when daylight came at noon on the 15th\r\nwe observed a large lead running from the north-west horizon towards\r\nthe ship till it struck the western lead, circling ahead of the ship,\r\nthen continuing to the south-south-east. A lead astern connected with\r\nthis new lead on either side of the _Endurance_, thus separating our\r\nfloe completely from the main body of the pack. A blizzard from the\r\nsouth-east swept down during the 16th. At 1 p.m. the blizzard lulled\r\nfor five minutes; then the wind jumped round to the opposite quarter\r\nand the barometer rose suddenly. The centre of a cyclonic movement had\r\npassed over us, and the compass recorded an extraordinarily rapid swing\r\nof the floe. I could see nothing through the mist and snow, and I\r\nthought it possible that a magnetic storm or a patch of local magnetic\r\nattraction had caused the compass, and not the floe, to swing, Our floe\r\nwas now about 2½ miles long north and south and 3 miles wide east and\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nThe month of May passed with few incidents of importance. Hurley, our\r\nhandy man, installed our small electric-lighting plant and placed\r\nlights for occasional use in the observatory, the meteorological\r\nstation, and various other points. We could not afford to use the\r\nelectric lamps freely. Hurley also rigged two powerful lights on poles\r\nprojecting from the ship to port and starboard. These lamps would\r\nilluminate the “dogloos” brilliantly on the darkest winter’s day and\r\nwould be invaluable in the event of the floe breaking during the dark\r\ndays of winter. We could imagine what it would mean to get fifty dogs\r\naboard without lights while the floe was breaking and rafting under our\r\nfeet. May 24, Empire Day, was celebrated with the singing of patriotic\r\nsongs in the Ritz, where all hands joined in wishing a speedy victory\r\nfor the British arms. We could not know how the war was progressing,\r\nbut we hoped that the Germans had already been driven from France and\r\nthat the Russian armies had put the seal on the Allies’ success. The\r\nwar was a constant subject of discussion aboard the _Endurance_, and\r\nmany campaigns were fought on the map during the long months of\r\ndrifting. The moon in the latter part of May was sweeping continuously\r\nthrough our starlit sky in great high circles. The weather generally\r\nwas good, with constant minus temperatures. The log on May 27 recorded:\r\n\r\n“Brilliantly fine clear weather with bright moonlight throughout. The\r\nmoon’s rays are wonderfully strong, making midnight seem as light as an\r\nordinary overcast midday in temperate climes. The great clearness of\r\nthe atmosphere probably accounts for our having eight hours of twilight\r\nwith a beautiful soft golden glow to the northward. A little rime and\r\nglazed frost are found aloft. The temperature is –20° Fahr. A few wisps\r\nof cirrus-cloud are seen and a little frost-smoke shows in one or two\r\ndirections, but the cracks and leads near the ship appear to have\r\nfrozen over again.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Pups]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ice-Pressure Approaching the Ship]\r\n\r\n\r\nCrean had started to take the pups out for runs, and it was very\r\namusing to see them with their rolling canter just managing to keep\r\nabreast by the sledge and occasionally cocking an eye with an appealing\r\nlook in the hope of being taken aboard for a ride. As an addition to\r\ntheir foster-father, Crean, the pups had adopted Amundsen. They\r\ntyrannized over him most unmercifully. It was a common sight to see\r\nhim, the biggest dog in the pack, sitting out in the cold with an air\r\nof philosophic resignation while a corpulent pup occupied the entrance\r\nto his “dogloo.” The intruder was generally the pup Nelson, who just\r\nshowed his forepaws and face, and one was fairly sure to find Nelly,\r\nRoger, and Toby coiled up comfortably behind him. At hoosh-time Crean\r\nhad to stand by Amundsen’s food, since otherwise the pups would eat the\r\nbig dog’s ration while he stood back to give them fair play. Sometimes\r\ntheir consciences would smite them and they would drag round a seal’s\r\nhead, half a penguin, or a large lump of frozen meat or blubber to\r\nAmundsen’s kennel for rent. It was interesting to watch the big dog\r\nplay with them, seizing them by throat or neck in what appeared to be a\r\nfierce fashion, while really quite gentle with them, and all the time\r\nteaching them how to hold their own in the world and putting them up to\r\nall the tricks of dog life.\r\n\r\nThe drift of the _Endurance_ in the grip of the pack continued without\r\nincident of importance through June. Pressure was reported\r\noccasionally, but the ice in the immediate vicinity of the ship\r\nremained firm. The light was now very bad except in the period when the\r\nfriendly moon was above the horizon. A faint twilight round about noon\r\nof each day reminded us of the sun, and assisted us in the important\r\nwork of exercising the dogs. The care of the teams was our heaviest\r\nresponsibility in those days. The movement of the floes was beyond all\r\nhuman control, and there was nothing to be gained by allowing one’s\r\nmind to struggle with the problems of the future, though it was hard to\r\navoid anxiety at times. The conditioning and training of the dogs\r\nseemed essential, whatever fate might be in store for us, and the teams\r\nwere taken out by their drivers whenever the weather permitted.\r\nRivalries arose, as might have been expected, and on the 15th of the\r\nmonth a great race, the “Antarctic Derby,” took place. It was a notable\r\nevent. The betting had been heavy, and every man aboard the ship stood\r\nto win or lose on the result of the contest. Some money had been\r\nstaked, but the wagers that thrilled were those involving stores of\r\nchocolate and cigarettes. The course had been laid off from Khyber\r\nPass, at the eastern end of the old lead ahead of the ship, to a point\r\nclear of the jib-boom, a distance of about 700 yds. Five teams went out\r\nin the dim noon twilight, with a zero temperature and an aurora\r\nflickering faintly to the southward. The starting signal was to be\r\ngiven by the flashing of a light on the meteorological station. I was\r\nappointed starter, Worsley was judge, and James was timekeeper. The\r\nbos’n, with a straw hat added to his usual Antarctic attire, stood on a\r\nbox near the winning-post, and was assisted by a couple of shady\r\ncharacters to shout the odds, which were displayed on a board hung\r\naround his neck—6 to 4 on Wild, “evens” on Crean, 2 to 1 against\r\nHurley, 6 to 1 against Macklin, and 8 to 1 against McIlroy. Canvas\r\nhandkerchiefs fluttered from an improvised grand stand, and the pups,\r\nwhich had never seen such strange happenings before, sat round and\r\nhowled with excitement. The spectators could not see far in the dim\r\nlight, but they heard the shouts of the drivers as the teams approached\r\nand greeted the victory of the favourite with a roar of cheering that\r\nmust have sounded strange indeed to any seals or penguins that happened\r\nto be in our neighbourhood. Wild’s time was 2 min. 16 sec., or at the\r\nrate of 10½ miles per hour for the course.\r\n\r\nWe celebrated Midwinter’s Day on the 22nd. The twilight extended over a\r\nperiod of about six hours that day, and there was a good light at noon\r\nfrom the moon, and also a northern glow with wisps of beautiful pink\r\ncloud along the horizon. A sounding gave 262 fathoms with a mud bottom.\r\nNo land was in sight from the mast-head, although our range of vision\r\nextended probably a full degree to the westward. The day was observed\r\nas a holiday, necessary work only being undertaken, and, after the best\r\ndinner the cook could provide, all hands gathered in the Ritz, where\r\nspeeches, songs, and toasts occupied the evening. After supper at\r\nmidnight we sang “God Save the King” and wished each other all success\r\nin the days of sunshine and effort that lay ahead. At this time the\r\n_Endurance_ was making an unusually rapid drift to the north under the\r\ninfluence of a fresh southerly to south-westerly breeze. We travelled\r\n39 miles to the north in five days before a breeze that only once\r\nattained the force of a gale and then for no more than an hour. The\r\nabsence of strong winds, in comparison with the almost unceasing winter\r\nblizzards of the Ross Sea, was a feature of the Weddell Sea that\r\nimpressed itself upon me during the winter months.\r\n\r\nAnother race took place a few days after the “Derby.” The two crack\r\nteams, driven by Hurley and Wild, met in a race from Khyber Pass.\r\nWild’s team, pulling 910 lbs., or 130 lbs. per dog, covered the 700\r\nyds. in 2 min. 9 sec., or at the rate of 11.1 miles per hour. Hurley’s\r\nteam, with the same load, did the run in 2 min. 16 sec. The race was\r\nawarded by the judge to Hurley owing to Wild failing to “weigh in”\r\ncorrectly. I happened to be a part of the load on his sledge, and a\r\nskid over some new drift within fifty yards of the winning post\r\nresulted in my being left on the snow. It should be said in justice to\r\nthe dogs that this accident, while justifying the disqualification,\r\ncould not have made any material difference in the time.\r\n\r\nThe approach of the returning sun was indicated by beautiful sunrise\r\nglows on the horizon in the early days of July. We had nine hours’\r\ntwilight on the 10th, and the northern sky, low to the horizon, was\r\ntinted with gold for about seven hours. Numerous cracks and leads\r\nextended in all directions to within 300 yds. of the ship. Thin\r\nwavering black lines close to the northern horizon were probably\r\ndistant leads refracted into the sky. Sounds of moderate pressure came\r\nto our ears occasionally, but the ship was not involved. At midnight on\r\nthe 11th a crack in the lead ahead of the _Endurance_ opened out\r\nrapidly, and by 2 a.m. was over 200 yds. wide in places with an area of\r\nopen water to the south-west. Sounds of pressure were heard along this\r\nlead, which soon closed to a width of about 30 yds. and then froze\r\nover. The temperature at that time was –23° Fahr.\r\n\r\nThe most severe blizzard we had experienced in the Weddell Sea swept\r\ndown upon the _Endurance_ on the evening of the 13th, and by\r\nbreakfast-time on the following morning the kennels to the windward, or\r\nsouthern side of the ship were buried under 5 ft. of drift. I gave\r\norders that no man should venture beyond the kennels. The ship was\r\ninvisible at a distance of fifty yards, and it was impossible to\r\npreserve one’s sense of direction in the raging wind and suffocating\r\ndrift. To walk against the gale was out of the question. Face and eyes\r\nbecame snowed up within two minutes, and serious frost-bites would have\r\nbeen the penalty of perseverance. The dogs stayed in their kennels for\r\nthe most part, the “old stagers” putting out a paw occasionally in\r\norder to keep open a breathing-hole. By evening the gale had attained a\r\nforce of 60 or 70 miles an hour, and the ship was trembling under the\r\nattack. But we were snug enough in our quarters aboard until the\r\nmorning of the 14th, when all hands turned out to shovel the snow from\r\ndeck and kennels. The wind was still keen and searching, with a\r\ntemperature of something like –30° Fahr., and it was necessary for us\r\nto be on guard against frost-bite. At least 100 tons of snow were piled\r\nagainst the bows and port side, where the weight of the drift had\r\nforced the floe downward. The lead ahead had opened out during the\r\nnight, cracked the pack from north to south and frozen over again,\r\nadding 300 yds. to the distance between the ship and “Khyber Pass.” The\r\nbreakdown gang had completed its work by lunch-time. The gale was then\r\ndecreasing and the three-days-old moon showed as a red crescent on the\r\nnorthern horizon. The temperature during the blizzard had ranged from\r\n–21° to –33.5° Fahr. It is usual for the temperature to rise during a\r\nblizzard, and the failure to produce any Föhn effect of this nature\r\nsuggested an absence of high land for at least 200 miles to the south\r\nand south-west. The weather did not clear until the 16th. We saw then\r\nthat the appearance of the surrounding pack had been altered completely\r\nby the blizzard. The “island” floe containing the _Endurance_ still\r\nstood fast, but cracks and masses of ice thrown up by pressure could be\r\nseen in all directions. An area of open water was visible on the\r\nhorizon to the north, with a water indication in the northern sky.\r\n\r\nThe ice-pressure, which was indicated by distant rumblings and the\r\nappearance of formidable ridges, was increasingly a cause of anxiety.\r\nThe areas of disturbance were gradually approaching the ship. During\r\nJuly 21 we could bear the grinding and crashing of the working floes to\r\nthe south-west and west and could see cracks opening, working, and\r\nclosing ahead.\r\n\r\n“The ice is rafting up to a height of 10 or 15 ft. in places, the\r\nopposing floes are moving against one another at the rate of about 200\r\nyds. per hour. The noise resembles the roar of heavy, distant surf.\r\nStanding on the stirring ice one can imagine it is disturbed by the\r\nbreathing and tossing of a mighty giant below.”\r\n\r\nEarly on the afternoon of the 22nd a 2-ft. crack, running south-west\r\nand north-east for a distance of about two miles, approached to within\r\n35 yds. of the port quarter. I had all the sledges brought aboard and\r\nset a special watch in case it became necessary to get the dogs off the\r\nfloe in a hurry. This crack was the result of heavy pressure 300 yds.\r\naway on the port bow, where huge blocks of ice were piled up in wild\r\nand threatening confusion. The pressure at that point was enormous.\r\nBlocks weighing many tons were raised 15 ft. above the level of the\r\nfloe. I arranged to divide the night watches with Worsley and Wild, and\r\nnone of us had much rest. The ship was shaken by heavy bumps, and we\r\nwere on the alert to see that no dogs had fallen into cracks. The\r\nmorning light showed that our island had been reduced considerably\r\nduring the night. Our long months of rest and safety seemed to be at an\r\nend, and a period of stress had begun.\r\n\r\nDuring the following day I had a store of sledging provisions, oil,\r\nmatches, and other essentials placed on the upper deck handy to the\r\nstarboard quarter boat, so as to be in readiness for a sudden\r\nemergency. The ice was grinding and working steadily to the southward,\r\nand in the evening some large cracks appeared on the port quarter,\r\nwhile a crack alongside opened out to 15 yds. The blizzard seemed to\r\nhave set the ice in strong movement towards the north, and the\r\nsouth-westerly and west-south-westerly winds that prevailed two days\r\nout of three maintained the drift. I hoped that this would continue\r\nunchecked, since our chance of getting clear of the pack early in the\r\nspring appeared to depend upon our making a good northing. Soundings at\r\nthis time gave depths of from 186 to 190 fathoms, with a glacial mud\r\nbottom. No land was in sight. The light was improving. A great deal of\r\nice-pressure was heard and observed in all directions during the 25th,\r\nmuch of it close to the port quarter of the ship. On the starboard bow\r\nhuge blocks of ice, weighing many tons and 5 ft. in thickness, were\r\npushed up on the old floe to a height of 15 to 20 ft. The floe that\r\nheld the _Endurance_ was swung to and fro by the pressure during the\r\nday, but came back to the old bearing before midnight.\r\n\r\n“The ice for miles around is much looser. There are numerous cracks and\r\nshort leads to the north-east and south-east. Ridges are being forced\r\nup in all directions, and there is a water-sky to the south-east. It\r\nwould be a relief to be able to make some effort on our own behalf; but\r\nwe can do nothing until the ice releases our ship. If the floes\r\ncontinue to loosen, we may break out within the next few weeks and\r\nresume the fight. In the meantime the pressure continues, and it is\r\nhard to foresee the outcome. Just before noon to-day (July 26) the top\r\nof the sun appeared by refraction for one minute, seventy-nine days\r\nafter our last sunset. A few minutes earlier a small patch of the sun\r\nhad been thrown up on one of the black streaks above the horizon. All\r\nhands are cheered by the indication that the end of the winter darkness\r\nis near.... Clark finds that with returning daylight the _diatoms_ are\r\nagain appearing. His nets and line are stained a pale yellow, and much\r\nof the newly formed ice has also a faint brown or yellow tinge. The\r\n_diatoms_ cannot multiply without light, and the ice formed since\r\nFebruary can be distinguished in the pressure-ridges by its clear blue\r\ncolour. The older masses of ice are of a dark earthy brown, dull\r\nyellow, or reddish brown.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ice-Rafting]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Returning Sun]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe break-up of our floe came suddenly on Sunday, August 1, just one\r\nyear after the _Endurance_ left the South-West India Docks on the\r\nvoyage to the Far South. The position was lat. 72° 26´ S., long. 48°\r\n10´ W. The morning brought a moderate south-westerly gale with heavy\r\nsnow, and at 8 a.m., after some warning movements of the ice, the floe\r\ncracked 40 yds. off the starboard bow. Two hours later the floe began\r\nto break up all round us under pressure and the ship listed over 10\r\ndegrees to starboard. I had the dogs and sledges brought aboard at once\r\nand the gangway hoisted. The animals behaved well. They came aboard\r\neagerly as though realizing their danger, and were placed in their\r\nquarters on deck without a single fight occurring. The pressure was\r\ncracking the floe rapidly, rafting it close to the slip and forcing\r\nmasses of ice beneath the keel. Presently the _Endurance_ listed\r\nheavily to port against the gale, and at the same time was forced\r\nahead, astern, and sideways several times by the grinding floes. She\r\nreceived one or two hard nips, but resisted them without as much as a\r\ncreak. It looked at one stage as if the ship was to be made the\r\nplaything of successive floes, and I was relieved when she came to a\r\nstandstill with a large piece of our old “dock” under the starboard\r\nbilge. I had the boats cleared away ready for lowering, got up some\r\nadditional stores, and set a double watch. All hands were warned to\r\nstand by, get what sleep they could, and have their warmest clothing at\r\nhand. Around us lay the ruins of “Dog Town” amid the debris of\r\npressure-ridges. Some of the little dwellings had been crushed flat\r\nbeneath blocks of ice; others had been swallowed and pulverized when\r\nthe ice opened beneath them and closed again. It was a sad sight, but\r\nmy chief concern just then was the safety of the rudder, which was\r\nbeing attacked viciously by the ice. We managed to pole away a large\r\nlump that had become jammed between the rudder and the stern-post, but\r\nI could see that damage had been done, though a close examination was\r\nnot possible that day.\r\n\r\nAfter the ship had come to a standstill in her new position very heavy\r\npressure was set up. Some of the trenails were started and beams\r\nbuckled slightly under the terrific stresses. But the _Endurance_ had\r\nbeen built to withstand the attacks of the ice, and she lifted bravely\r\nas the floes drove beneath her. The effects of the pressure around us\r\nwere awe-inspiring. Mighty blocks of ice, gripped between meeting\r\nfloes, rose slowly till they jumped like cherry-stones squeezed between\r\nthumb and finger. The pressure of millions of tons of moving ice was\r\ncrushing and smashing inexorably. If the ship was once gripped firmly\r\nher fate would be sealed.\r\n\r\nThe gale from the south-west blew all night and moderated during the\r\nafternoon of the 2nd to a stiff breeze. The pressure had almost ceased.\r\nApparently the gale had driven the southern pack down upon us, causing\r\ncongestion in our area; the pressure had stopped when the whole of the\r\npack got into motion. The gale had given us some northing, but it had\r\ndealt the _Endurance_ what might prove to be a severe blow. The rudder\r\nhad been driven hard over to starboard and the blade partially torn\r\naway from the rudder-head. Heavy masses of ice were still jammed\r\nagainst the stern, and it was impossible to ascertain the extent of the\r\ndamage at that time. I felt that it would be impossible in any case to\r\neffect repairs in the moving pack. The ship lay steady all night, and\r\nthe sole sign of continuing pressure was an occasional slight rumbling\r\nshock. We rigged shelters and kennels for the dogs inboard.\r\n\r\nThe weather on August 3 was overcast and misty. We had nine hours of\r\ntwilight, with good light at noon. There was no land in sight for ten\r\nmiles from the mast-head. The pack as far as the eye could reach was in\r\na condition of chaos, much rafted and consolidated, with very large\r\npressure-ridges in all directions. At 9 p.m. a rough altitude of\r\n_Canopus_ gave the latitude as 71° 55´ 17´´ S. The drift, therefore,\r\nhad been about 37 miles to the north in three days. Four of the poorest\r\ndogs were shot this day. They were suffering severely from worms, and\r\nwe could not afford to keep sick dogs under the changed conditions. The\r\nsun showed through the clouds on the northern horizon for an hour on\r\nthe 4th. There was no open water to be seen from aloft in any\r\ndirection. We saw from the masthead to west-south-west an appearance of\r\nbarrier, land, or a very long iceberg, about 20 odd miles away, but the\r\nhorizon clouded over before we could determine its nature. We tried\r\ntwice to make a sounding that day, but failed on each occasion. The\r\nKelvin machine gave no bottom at the full length of the line, 370\r\nfathoms. After much labour we made a hole in the ice near the\r\nstern-post large enough for the Lucas machine with a 32-lb. lead; but\r\nthis appeared to be too light. The machine stopped at 452 fathoms,\r\nleaving us in doubt as to whether bottom had been reached. Then in\r\nheaving up we lost the lead, the thin wire cutting its way into the ice\r\nand snapping. All hands and the carpenter were busy this day making and\r\nplacing kennels on the upper deck, and by nightfall all the dogs were\r\ncomfortably housed, ready for any weather. The sun showed through the\r\nclouds above the northern horizon for nearly an hour.\r\n\r\nThe remaining days of August were comparatively uneventful. The ice\r\naround the ship froze firm again and little movement occurred in our\r\nneighbourhood. The training of the dogs, including the puppies,\r\nproceeded actively, and provided exercise as well as occupation. The\r\ndrift to the north-west continued steadily. We had bad luck with\r\nsoundings, the weather interfering at times and the gear breaking on\r\nseveral occasions, but a big increase in the depth showed that we had\r\npassed over the edge of the Weddell Sea plateau. A sounding of about\r\n1700 fathoms on August 10 agreed fairly well with Filchner’s 1924\r\nfathoms, 130 miles east of our then position. An observation at noon of\r\nthe 8th had given us lat. 71° 23´ S., long. 49° 13´ W. Minus\r\ntemperatures prevailed still, but the daylight was increasing. We\r\ncaptured a few emperor penguins which were making their way to the\r\nsouth-west. Ten penguins taken on the 19th were all in poor condition,\r\nand their stomachs contained nothing but stones and a few cuttle-fish\r\nbeaks. A sounding on the 17th gave 1676 fathoms, 10 miles west of the\r\ncharted position of Morell Land. No land could be seen from the\r\nmast-head, and I decided that Morell Land must be added to the long\r\nlist of Antarctic islands and continental coasts that on close\r\ninvestigation have resolved themselves into icebergs. On clear days we\r\ncould get an extended view in all directions from the mast-head, and\r\nthe line of the pack was broken only by familiar bergs. About one\r\nhundred bergs were in view on a fine day, and they seemed practically\r\nthe same as when they started their drift with us nearly seven months\r\nearlier. The scientists wished to inspect some of the neighbouring\r\nbergs at close quarters, but sledge travelling outside the well-trodden\r\narea immediately around the ship proved difficult and occasionally\r\ndangerous. On August 20, for example, Worsley, Hurley, and Greenstreet\r\nstarted off for the Rampart Berg and got on to a lead of young ice that\r\nundulated perilously beneath their feet. A quick turn saved them.\r\n\r\nA wonderful mirage of the Fata Morgana type was visible on August 20.\r\nThe day was clear and bright, with a blue sky overhead and some rime\r\naloft.\r\n\r\n“The distant pack is thrown up into towering barrier-like cliffs, which\r\nare reflected in blue lakes and lanes of water at their base. Great\r\nwhite and golden cities of Oriental appearance at close intervals along\r\nthese clifftops indicate distant bergs, some not previously known to\r\nus. Floating above these are wavering violet and creamy lines of still\r\nmore remote bergs and pack. The lines rise and fall, tremble,\r\ndissipate, and reappear in an endless transformation scene. The\r\nsouthern pack and bergs, catching the sun’s rays, are golden, but to\r\nthe north the ice-masses are purple. Here the bergs assume changing\r\nforms, first a castle, then a balloon just clear of the horizon, that\r\nchanges swiftly into an immense mushroom, a mosque, or a cathedral. The\r\nprincipal characteristic is the vertical lengthening of the object, a\r\nsmall pressure-ridge being given the appearance of a line of\r\nbattlements or towering cliffs. The mirage is produced by refraction\r\nand is intensified by the columns of comparatively warm air rising from\r\nseveral cracks and leads that have opened eight to twenty miles away\r\nnorth and south.”\r\n\r\nWe noticed this day that a considerable change had taken place in our\r\nposition relative to the Rampart Berg. It appeared that a big lead had\r\nopened and that there had been some differential movement of the pack.\r\nThe opening movement might presage renewed pressure. A few hours later\r\nthe dog teams, returning from exercise, crossed a narrow crack that had\r\nappeared ahead of the ship. This crack opened quickly to 60 ft. and\r\nwould have given us trouble if the dogs had been left on the wrong\r\nside. It closed on the 25th and pressure followed in its neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wild and Shackleton in the Heavy Pressure]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Exercising the Dogs]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 24 we were two miles north of the latitude of Morell’s\r\nfarthest south, and over 10° of longitude, or more than 200 miles, west\r\nof his position. From the mast-head no land could be seen within twenty\r\nmiles, and no land of over 500 ft. altitude could have escaped\r\nobservation on our side of long. 52° W. A sounding of 1900 fathoms on\r\nAugust 25 was further evidence of the non-existence of New South\r\nGreenland. There was some movement of the ice near the ship during the\r\nconcluding days of the month. All hands were called out in the night of\r\nAugust 26, sounds of pressure having been followed by the cracking of\r\nthe ice alongside the ship, but the trouble did not develop\r\nimmediately. Late on the night of the 31st the ice began to work ahead\r\nof the ship and along the port side. Creaking and groaning of timbers,\r\naccompanied by loud snapping sounds fore and aft, told their story of\r\nstrain. The pressure continued during the following day, beams and deck\r\nplanks occasionally buckling to the strain. The ponderous floes were\r\ngrinding against each other under the influence of wind and current,\r\nand our ship seemed to occupy for the time being an undesirable\r\nposition near the centre of the disturbance; but she resisted staunchly\r\nand showed no sign of water in the bilges, although she had not been\r\npumped out for six months. The pack extended to the horizon in every\r\ndirection. I calculated that we were 250 miles from the nearest known\r\nland to the westward, and more than 500 miles from the nearest outpost\r\nof civilization, Wilhelmina Bay. I hoped we would not have to undertake\r\na march across the moving ice-fields. The _Endurance_ we knew to be\r\nstout and true; but no ship ever built by man could live if taken\r\nfairly in the grip of the floes and prevented from rising to the\r\nsurface of the grinding ice. These were anxious days. In the early\r\nmorning of September 2 the ship jumped and shook to the accompaniment\r\nof cracks and groans, and some of the men who had been in the berths\r\nhurried on deck. The pressure eased a little later in the day, when the\r\nice on the port side broke away from the ship to just abaft the main\r\nrigging. The _Endurance_ was still held aft and at the rudder, and a\r\nlarge mass of ice could be seen adhering to the port bow, rising to\r\nwithin three feet of the surface. I wondered if this ice had got its\r\ngrip by piercing the sheathing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nLOSS OF THE _ENDURANCE_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ice did not trouble us again seriously until the end of September,\r\nthough during the whole month the floes were seldom entirely without\r\nmovement. The roar of pressure would come to us across the otherwise\r\nsilent ice-fields, and bring with it a threat and a warning. Watching\r\nfrom the crow’s-nest, we could see sometimes the formation of\r\npressure-ridges. The sunshine glittered on newly riven ice-surfaces as\r\nthe masses of shattered floe rose and fell away from the line of\r\npressure. The area of disturbance would advance towards us, recede, and\r\nadvance again. The routine of work and play on the _Endurance_\r\nproceeded steadily. Our plans and preparations for any contingency that\r\nmight arise during the approaching summer had been made, but there\r\nseemed always plenty to do in and about our prisoned ship. Runs with\r\nthe dogs and vigorous games of hockey and football on the rough\r\nsnow-covered floe kept all hands in good fettle. The record of one or\r\ntwo of these September days will indicate the nature of our life and\r\nour surroundings:\r\n\r\n“_September_ 4.—Temperature, –14.1° Fahr. Light easterly breeze, blue\r\nsky, and stratus clouds. During forenoon notice a distinct terra-cotta\r\nor biscuit colour in the stratus clouds to the north. This travelled\r\nfrom east to west and could conceivably have come from some of the\r\nGraham Land volcanoes, now about 300 miles distant to the north-west.\r\nThe upper current of air probably would come from that direction. Heavy\r\nrime. Pack unbroken and unchanged as far as visible. No land for 22\r\nmiles. No animal life observed.”\r\n\r\n“_September_ 7.—Temperature, –10.8° Fahr. Moderate easterly to\r\nsoutherly winds, overcast and misty, with light snow till midnight,\r\nwhen weather cleared. Blue sky and fine clear weather to noon. Much\r\nrime aloft. Thick fresh snow on ship and floe that glistens brilliantly\r\nin the morning sunlight. Little clouds of faint violet-coloured mist\r\nrise from the lower and brinier portions of the pack, which stretches\r\nunbroken to the horizon. Very great refraction all round. A tabular\r\nberg about fifty feet high ten miles west is a good index of the amount\r\nof refraction. On ordinary days it shows from the mast-head, clear-cut\r\nagainst the sky; with much refraction, the pack beyond at the back of\r\nit lifts up into view; to-day a broad expanse of miles of pack is seen\r\nabove it. Numerous other bergs generally seen in silhouette are, at\r\nfirst sight, lost, but after a closer scrutiny they appear as large\r\nlumps or dark masses well below the horizon. Refraction generally\r\nresults in too big an altitude when observing the sun for position, but\r\nto-day, the horizon is thrown up so much that the altitude is about 12´\r\ntoo small. No land visible for twenty miles. No animal life observed.\r\nLower Clark’s tow-net with 566 fathoms of wire, and hoist it up at two\r\nand a half miles an hour by walking across the floe with the wire.\r\nResult rather meagre—jelly-fish and some fish larvæ. Exercise dogs in\r\nsledge teams. The young dogs, under Crean’s care, pull as well, though\r\nnot so strongly, as the best team in the pack. Hercules for the last\r\nfortnight or more has constituted himself leader of the orchestra. Two\r\nor three times in the twenty-four hours he starts a howl—a deep,\r\nmelodious howl—and in about thirty seconds he has the whole pack in\r\nfull song, the great deep, booming, harmonious song of the half-wolf\r\npack.”\r\n\r\nBy the middle of September we were running short of fresh meat for the\r\ndogs. The seals and penguins seemed to have abandoned our neighbourhood\r\naltogether. Nearly five months had passed since we killed a seal, and\r\npenguins had been seen seldom. Clark, who was using his trawl as often\r\nas possible, reported that there was a marked absence of _plankton_ in\r\nthe sea, and we assumed that the seals and the penguins had gone in\r\nsearch of their accustomed food. The men got an emperor on the 23rd.\r\nThe dogs, which were having their sledging exercise, became wildly\r\nexcited when the penguin, which had risen in a crack, was driven\r\nashore, and the best efforts of the drivers failed to save it alive. On\r\nthe following day Wild, Hurley, Macklin, and McIlroy took their teams\r\nto the Stained Berg, about seven miles west of the ship, and on their\r\nway back got a female crab-eater, which they killed, skinned, and left\r\nto be picked up later. They ascended to the top of the berg, which lay\r\nin about lat. 69° 30´ S., long. 51° W., and from an elevation of 110\r\nft. could see no land. Samples of the discoloured ice from the berg\r\nproved to contain dust with black gritty particles or sand-grains.\r\nAnother seal, a bull Weddell, was secured on the 26th. The return of\r\nseal-life was opportune, since we had nearly finished the winter supply\r\nof dog-biscuit and wished to be able to feed the dogs on meat. The\r\nseals meant a supply of blubber, moreover, to supplement our small\r\nremaining stock of coal when the time came to get up steam again. We\r\ninitiated a daylight-saving system on this day by putting forward the\r\nclock one hour. “This is really pandering to the base but universal\r\npassion that men, and especially seafarers, have for getting up late,\r\notherwise we would be honest and make our routine earlier instead of\r\nflogging the clock.”\r\n\r\nDuring the concluding days of September the roar of the pressure grew\r\nlouder, and I could see that the area of disturbance was rapidly\r\napproaching the ship. Stupendous forces were at work and the fields of\r\nfirm ice around the _Endurance_ were being diminished steadily.\r\nSeptember 30 was a bad day. It began well, for we got two penguins and\r\nfive seals during the morning. Three other seals were seen. But at 3\r\np.m. cracks that had opened during the night alongside the ship\r\ncommenced to work in a lateral direction. The ship sustained terrific\r\npressure on the port side forward, the heaviest shocks being under the\r\nforerigging. It was the worst squeeze we had experienced. The decks\r\nshuddered and jumped, beams arched, and stanchions buckled and shook. I\r\nordered all hands to stand by in readiness for whatever emergency might\r\narise. Even the dogs seemed to feel the tense anxiety of the moment.\r\nBut the ship resisted valiantly, and just when it appeared that the\r\nlimit of her strength was being reached the huge floe that was pressing\r\ndown upon us cracked across and so gave relief.\r\n\r\n“The behaviour of our ship in the ice has been magnificent,” wrote\r\nWorsley. “Since we have been beset her staunchness and endurance have\r\nbeen almost past belief again and again. She has been nipped with a\r\nmillion-ton pressure and risen nobly, falling clear of the water out on\r\nthe ice. She has been thrown to and fro like a shuttlecock a dozen\r\ntimes. She has been strained, her beams arched upwards, by the fearful\r\npressure; her very sides opened and closed again as she was actually\r\nbent and curved along her length, groaning like a living thing. It will\r\nbe sad if such a brave little craft should be finally crushed in the\r\nremorseless, slowly strangling grip of the Weddell pack after ten\r\nmonths of the bravest and most gallant fight ever put up by a ship.”\r\n\r\nThe _Endurance_ deserved all that could be said in praise of her.\r\nShipwrights had never done sounder or better work; but how long could\r\nshe continue the fight under such conditions? We were drifting into the\r\ncongested area of the western Weddell Sea, the worst portion of the\r\nworst sea in the world, where the pack, forced on irresistibly by wind\r\nand current, impinges on the western shore and is driven up in huge\r\ncorrugated ridges and chaotic fields of pressure. The vital question\r\nfor us was whether or not the ice would open sufficiently to release\r\nus, or at least give us a chance of release, before the drift carried\r\nus into the most dangerous area. There was no answer to be got from the\r\nsilent bergs and the grinding floes, and we faced the month of October\r\nwith anxious hearts.\r\n\r\nThe leads in the pack appeared to have opened out a little on October\r\n1, but not sufficiently to be workable even if we had been able to\r\nrelease the _Endurance_ from the floe. The day was calm, cloudy and\r\nmisty in the forenoon and clearer in the afternoon, when we observed\r\nwell-defined parhelia. The ship was subjected to slight pressure at\r\nintervals. Two bull crab-eaters climbed on to the floe close to the\r\nship and were shot by Wild. They were both big animals in prime\r\ncondition, and I felt that there was no more need for anxiety as to the\r\nsupply of fresh meat for the dogs. Seal-liver made a welcome change in\r\nour own menu. The two bulls were marked, like many of their kind, with\r\nlong parallel scars about three inches apart, evidently the work of the\r\nkillers. A bull we killed on the following day had four parallel scars,\r\nsixteen inches long, on each side of its body; they were fairly deep\r\nand one flipper had been nearly torn away. The creature must have\r\nescaped from the jaws of a killer by a very small margin. Evidently\r\nlife beneath the pack is not always monotonous. We noticed that several\r\nof the bergs in the neighbourhood of the ship were changing their\r\nrelative positions more than they had done for months past. The floes\r\nwere moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crab-eater Seals]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Beginning of the End]\r\n\r\n\r\nOur position on Sunday, October 3, was lat. 69° 14´ S., long. 51° 8´ W.\r\nDuring the night the floe holding the ship aft cracked in several\r\nplaces, and this appeared to have eased the strain on the rudder. The\r\nforenoon was misty, with falls of snow, but the weather cleared later\r\nin the day and we could see that the pack was breaking. New leads had\r\nappeared, while several old leads had closed. Pressure-ridges had risen\r\nalong some of the cracks. The thickness of the season’s ice, now about\r\n230 days old, was 4 ft. 5 in. under 7 or 8 in. of snow. This ice had\r\nbeen slightly thicker in the early part of September, and I assumed\r\nthat some melting had begun below. Clark had recorded plus temperatures\r\nat depths of 150 and 200 fathoms in the concluding days of September.\r\nThe ice obviously had attained its maximum thickness by direct\r\nfreezing, and the heavier older floes had been created by the\r\nconsolidation of pressure-ice and the overlapping of floes under\r\nstrain. The air temperatures were still low, –24.5° Fahr. being\r\nrecorded on October 4.\r\n\r\nThe movement of the ice was increasing. Frost-smoke from opening cracks\r\nwas showing in all directions during October 6. It had the appearance\r\nin one place of a great prairie fire, rising from the surface and\r\ngetting higher as it drifted off before the wind in heavy, dark,\r\nrolling masses. At another point there was the appearance of a train\r\nrunning before the wind, the smoke rising from the locomotive straight\r\nupwards; and the smoke columns elsewhere gave the effect of warships\r\nsteaming in line ahead. During the following day the leads and cracks\r\nopened to such an extent that if the _Endurance_ could have been forced\r\nforward for thirty yards we could have proceeded for two or three\r\nmiles; but the effort did not promise any really useful result. The\r\nconditions did not change materially during the rest of that week. The\r\nposition on Sunday, October 10, was lat. 69° 21´ S., long. 50° 34´ W. A\r\nthaw made things uncomfortable for us that day. The temperature had\r\nrisen from –10° Fahr. to +29.8° Fahr., the highest we had experienced\r\nsince January, and the ship got dripping wet between decks. The upper\r\ndeck was clear of ice and snow and the cabins became unpleasantly\r\nmessy. The dogs, who hated wet, had a most unhappy air. Undoubtedly one\r\ngrows to like familiar conditions. We had lived long in temperatures\r\nthat would have seemed distressingly low in civilized life, and now we\r\nwere made uncomfortable by a degree of warmth that would have left the\r\nunaccustomed human being still shivering. The thaw was an indication\r\nthat winter was over, and we began preparations for reoccupying the\r\ncabins on the main deck. I had the shelter-house round the stern pulled\r\ndown on the 11th and made other preparations for working the ship as\r\nsoon as she got clear. The carpenter had built a wheel-house over the\r\nwheel aft as shelter in cold and heavy weather. The ice was still\r\nloosening and no land was visible for twenty miles.\r\n\r\nThe temperature remained relatively high for several days. All hands\r\nmoved to their summer quarters in the upper cabins on the 12th, to the\r\naccompaniment of much noise and laughter. Spring was in the air, and if\r\nthere were no green growing things to gladden our eyes, there were at\r\nleast many seals, penguins, and even whales disporting themselves in\r\nthe leads. The time for renewed action was coming, and though our\r\nsituation was grave enough, we were facing the future hopefully. The\r\ndogs were kept in a state of uproar by the sight of so much game. They\r\nbecame almost frenzied when a solemn-looking emperor penguin inspected\r\nthem gravely from some point of vantage on the floe and gave utterance\r\nto an apparently derisive “Knark!” At 7 p.m. on the 13th the ship broke\r\nfree of the floe on which she had rested to starboard sufficiently to\r\ncome upright. The rudder freed itself, but the propeller was found to\r\nbe athwartship, having been forced into that position by the floe some\r\ntime after August 1. The water was very clear and we could see the\r\nrudder, which appeared to have suffered only a slight twist to port at\r\nthe water-line. It moved quite freely. The propeller, as far as we\r\ncould see, was intact, but it could not be moved by the hand-gear,\r\nprobably owing to a film of ice in the stern gland and sleeve. I did\r\nnot think it advisable to attempt to deal with it at that stage. The\r\nship had not been pumped for eight months, but there was no water and\r\nnot much ice in the bilges. Meals were served again in the wardroom\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\nThe south-westerly breeze freshened to a gale on the 14th, and the\r\ntemperature fell from +31° Fahr. to –1° Fahr. At midnight the ship came\r\nfree from the floe and drifted rapidly astern. Her head fell off before\r\nthe wind until she lay nearly at right-angles across the narrow lead.\r\nThis was a dangerous position for rudder and propeller. The spanker was\r\nset, but the weight of the wind on the ship gradually forced the floes\r\nopen until the _Endurance_ swung right round and drove 100 yds. along\r\nthe lead. Then the ice closed and at 3 a.m. we were fast again. The\r\nwind died down during the day and the pack opened for five or six miles\r\nto the north. It was still loose on the following morning, and I had\r\nthe boiler pumped up with the intention of attempting to clear the\r\npropeller; but one of the manholes developed a leak, the packing being\r\nperished by cold or loosened by contraction, and the boiler had to be\r\nemptied out again.\r\n\r\nThe pack was rather closer on Sunday the 17th. Top-sails and head-sails\r\nwere set in the afternoon, and with a moderate north-easterly breeze we\r\ntried to force the ship ahead out of the lead; but she was held fast.\r\nLater that day heavy pressure developed. The two floes between which\r\nthe _Endurance_ was lying began to close and the ship was subjected to\r\na series of tremendously heavy strains. In the engine-room, the weakest\r\npoint, loud groans, crashes, and hammering sounds were heard. The iron\r\nplates on the floor buckled up and overrode with loud clangs. Meanwhile\r\nthe floes were grinding off each other’s projecting points and throwing\r\nup pressure-ridges. The ship stood the strain well for nearly an hour\r\nand then, to my great relief, began to rise with heavy jerks and jars.\r\nShe lifted ten inches forward and three feet four inches aft, at the\r\nsame time heeling six degrees to port. The ice was getting below us and\r\nthe immediate danger had passed. The position was lat. 69° 19´ S.,\r\nlong. 50° 40´ W.\r\n\r\nThe next attack of the ice came on the afternoon of October 18th. The\r\ntwo floes began to move laterally, exerting great pressure on the ship.\r\nSuddenly the floe on the port side cracked and huge pieces of ice shot\r\nup from under the port bilge. Within a few seconds the ship heeled over\r\nuntil she had a list of thirty degrees to port, being held under the\r\nstarboard bilge by the opposing floe. The lee boats were now almost\r\nresting on the floe. The midship dog-kennels broke away and crashed\r\ndown on to the lee kennels, and the howls and barks of the frightened\r\ndogs assisted to create a perfect pandemonium. Everything movable on\r\ndeck and below fell to the lee side, and for a few minutes it looked as\r\nif the _Endurance_ would be thrown upon her beam ends. Order was soon\r\nrestored. I had all fires put out and battens nailed on the deck to\r\ngive the dogs a foothold and enable people to get about. Then the crew\r\nlashed all the movable gear. If the ship had heeled any farther it\r\nwould have been necessary to release the lee boats and pull them clear,\r\nand Worsley was watching to give the alarm. Hurley meanwhile descended\r\nto the floe and took some photographs of the ship in her unusual\r\nposition. Dinner in the wardroom that evening was a curious affair.\r\nMost of the diners had to sit on the deck, their feet against battens\r\nand their plates on their knees. At 8 p.m. the floes opened, and within\r\na few minutes the _Endurance_ was nearly upright again. Orders were\r\ngiven for the ice to be chipped clear of the rudder. The men poled the\r\nblocks out of the way when they had been detached from the floe with\r\nthe long ice-chisels, and we were able to haul the ship’s stern into a\r\nclear berth. Then the boiler was pumped up. This work was completed\r\nearly in the morning of October 19, and during that day the engineer\r\nlit fires and got up steam very slowly, in order to economize fuel and\r\navoid any strain on the chilled boilers by unequal heating. The crew\r\ncut up all loose lumber, boxes, etc., and put them in the bunkers for\r\nfuel. The day was overcast, with occasional snowfalls, the temperature\r\n+12° Fahr. The ice in our neighbourhood was quiet, but in the distance\r\npressure was at work. The wind freshened in the evening, and we ran a\r\nwire-mooring astern. The barometer at 11 p.m. stood at 28.96, the\r\nlowest since the gales of July. An uproar among the dogs attracted\r\nattention late in the afternoon, and we found a 25-ft. whale cruising\r\nup and down in our pool. It pushed its head up once in characteristic\r\nkiller fashion, but we judged from its small curved dorsal fin that it\r\nwas a specimen of _Balænoptera acutorostrata_, not _Orca gladiator_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Within a few Seconds she heeled over until she had a\r\nList of Thirty Degrees to Port”]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Almost Overwhelmed]\r\n\r\n\r\nA strong south-westerly wind was blowing on October 20 and the pack was\r\nworking. The _Endurance_ was imprisoned securely in the pool, but our\r\nchance might come at any time. Watches were set so as to be ready for\r\nworking ship. Wild and Hudson, Greenstreet and Cheetham, Worsley and\r\nCrean, took the deck watches, and the Chief Engineer and Second\r\nEngineer kept watch and watch with three of the A.B.’s for stokers. The\r\nstaff and the forward hands, with the exception of the cook, the\r\ncarpenter and his mate, were on “watch and watch”—that is, four hours\r\non deck and four hours below, or off duty. The carpenter was busy\r\nmaking a light punt, which might prove useful in the navigation of\r\nlanes and channels. At 11 a.m. we gave the engines a gentle trial turn\r\nastern. Everything worked well after eight months of frozen inactivity,\r\nexcept that the bilge-pump and the discharge proved to be frozen up;\r\nthey were cleared with some little difficulty. The engineer reported\r\nthat to get steam he had used one ton of coal, with wood-ashes and\r\nblubber. The fires required to keep the boiler warm consumed one and a\r\nquarter to one and a half hundred-weight of coal per day. We had about\r\nfifty tons of coal remaining in the bunkers.\r\n\r\nOctober 21 and 22 were days of low temperature, which caused the open\r\nleads to freeze over. The pack was working, and ever and anon the roar\r\nof pressure came to our ears. We waited for the next move of the\r\ngigantic forces arrayed against us. The 23rd brought a strong\r\nnorth-westerly wind, and the movement of the floes and pressure-ridges\r\nbecame more formidable. Then on Sunday, October 24, there came what for\r\nthe _Endurance_ was the beginning of the end. The position was lat. 69°\r\n11´ S., long. 51° 5´ W. We had now twenty-two and a half hours of\r\ndaylight, and throughout the day we watched the threatening advance of\r\nthe floes. At 6.45 p.m. the ship sustained heavy pressure in a\r\ndangerous position. The attack of the ice is illustrated roughly in the\r\nappended diagram. The shaded portions represent the pool, covered with\r\nnew ice that afforded no support to the ship, and the arrows indicate\r\nthe direction of the pressure exercised by the thick floes and\r\npressure-ridges. The onslaught was all but irresistible. The\r\n_Endurance_ groaned and quivered as her starboard quarter was forced\r\nagainst the floe, twisting the sternpost and starting the heads and\r\nends of planking. The ice had lateral as well as forward movement, and\r\nthe ship was twisted and actually bent by the stresses. She began to\r\nleak dangerously at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI had the pumps rigged, got up steam, and started the bilge-pumps at 8\r\np.m. The pressure by that time had relaxed. The ship was making water\r\nrapidly aft, and the carpenter set to work to make a coffer-dam astern\r\nof the engines. All hands worked, watch and watch, throughout the\r\nnight, pumping ship and helping the carpenter. By morning the leak was\r\nbeing kept in check. The carpenter and his assistants caulked the\r\ncoffer-dam with strips of blankets and nailed strips over the seams\r\nwherever possible. The main or hand pump was frozen up and could not be\r\nused at once. After it had been knocked out Worsley, Greenstreet, and\r\nHudson went down in the bunkers and cleared the ice from the bilges.\r\n“This is not a pleasant job,” wrote Worsley. “We have to dig a hole\r\ndown through the coal while the beams and timbers groan and crack all\r\naround us like pistol-shots. The darkness is almost complete, and we\r\nmess about in the wet with half-frozen hands and try to keep the coal\r\nfrom slipping back into the bilges. The men on deck pour buckets of\r\nboiling water from the galley down the pipe as we prod and hammer from\r\nbelow, and at last we get the pump clear, cover up the bilges to keep\r\nthe coal out, and rush on deck, very thankful to find ourselves safe\r\nagain in the open air.”\r\n\r\nMonday, October 25, dawned cloudy and misty, with a minus temperature\r\nand a strong south-easterly breeze. All hands were pumping at intervals\r\nand assisting the carpenter with the coffer-dam. The leak was being\r\nkept under fairly easily, but the outlook was bad. Heavy\r\npressure-ridges were forming in all directions, and though the\r\nimmediate pressure upon the ship was not severe, I realized that the\r\nrespite would not be prolonged. The pack within our range of vision was\r\nbeing subjected to enormous compression, such as might be caused by\r\ncyclonic winds, opposing ocean currents, or constriction in a channel\r\nof some description. The pressure-ridges, massive and threatening,\r\ntestified to the overwhelming nature of the forces that were at work.\r\nHuge blocks of ice, weighing many tons, were lifted into the air and\r\ntossed aside as other masses rose beneath them. We were helpless\r\nintruders in a strange world, our lives dependent upon the play of grim\r\nelementary forces that made a mock of our puny efforts. I scarcely\r\ndared hope now that the _Endurance_ would live, and throughout that\r\nanxious day I reviewed again the plans made long before for the\r\nsledging journey that we must make in the event of our having to take\r\nto the ice. We were ready, as far as forethought could make us, for\r\nevery contingency. Stores, dogs, sledges, and equipment were ready to\r\nbe moved from the ship at a moment’s notice.\r\n\r\nThe following day brought bright clear weather, with a blue sky. The\r\nsunshine was inspiriting. The roar of pressure could be heard all\r\naround us. New ridges were rising, and I could see as the day wore on\r\nthat the lines of major disturbance were drawing nearer to the ship.\r\nThe _Endurance_ suffered some strains at intervals. Listening below, I\r\ncould hear the creaking and groaning of her timbers, the pistol-like\r\ncracks that told of the starting of a trenail or plank, and the faint,\r\nindefinable whispers of our ship’s distress. Overhead the sun shone\r\nserenely; occasional fleecy clouds drifted before the southerly breeze,\r\nand the light glinted and sparkled on the million facets of the new\r\npressure-ridges. The day passed slowly. At 7 p.m. very heavy pressure\r\ndeveloped, with twisting strains that racked the ship fore and aft. The\r\nbutts of planking were opened four and five inches on the starboard\r\nside, and at the same time we could see from the bridge that the ship\r\nwas bending like a bow under titanic pressure. Almost like a living\r\ncreature, she resisted the forces that would crush her; but it was a\r\none-sided battle. Millions of tons of ice pressed inexorably upon the\r\nlittle ship that had dared the challenge of the Antarctic. The\r\n_Endurance_ was now leaking badly, and at 9 p.m. I gave the order to\r\nlower boats, gear, provisions, and sledges to the floe, and move them\r\nto the flat ice a little way from the ship. The working of the ice\r\nclosed the leaks slightly at midnight, but all hands were pumping all\r\nnight. A strange occurrence was the sudden appearance of eight emperor\r\npenguins from a crack 100 yds. away at the moment when the pressure\r\nupon the ship was at its climax. They walked a little way towards us,\r\nhalted, and after a few ordinary calls proceeded to utter weird cries\r\nthat sounded like a dirge for the ship. None of us had ever before\r\nheard the emperors utter any other than the most simple calls or cries,\r\nand the effect of this concerted effort was almost startling.\r\n\r\nThen came a fateful day—Wednesday, October 27. The position was lat.\r\n69° 5´ S., long. 51° 30´ W. The temperature was –8.5° Fahr., a gentle\r\nsoutherly breeze was blowing and the sun shone in a clear sky.\r\n\r\n“After long months of ceaseless anxiety and strain, after times when\r\nhope beat high and times when the outlook was black indeed, the end of\r\nthe _Endurance_ has come. But though we have been compelled to abandon\r\nthe ship, which is crushed beyond all hope of ever being righted, we\r\nare alive and well, and we have stores and equipment for the task that\r\nlies before us. The task is to reach land with all the members of the\r\nExpedition. It is hard to write what I feel. To a sailor his ship is\r\nmore than a floating home, and in the _Endurance_ I had centred\r\nambitions, hopes, and desires. Now, straining and groaning, her timbers\r\ncracking and her wounds gaping, she is slowly giving up her sentient\r\nlife at the very outset of her career. She is crushed and abandoned\r\nafter drifting more than 570 miles in a north-westerly direction during\r\nthe 281 days since she became locked in the ice. The distance from the\r\npoint where she became beset to the place where she now rests mortally\r\nhurt in the grip of the floes is 573 miles, but the total drift through\r\nall observed positions has been 1186 miles, and probably we actually\r\ncovered more than 1500 miles. We are now 346 miles from Paulet Island,\r\nthe nearest point where there is any possibility of finding food and\r\nshelter. A small hut built there by the Swedish expedition in 1902 is\r\nfilled with stores left by the Argentine relief ship. I know all about\r\nthose stores, for I purchased them in London on behalf of the Argentine\r\nGovernment when they asked me to equip the relief expedition. The\r\ndistance to the nearest barrier west of us is about 180 miles, but a\r\nparty going there would still be about 360 miles from Paulet Island and\r\nthere would be no means of sustaining life on the barrier. We could not\r\ntake from here food enough for the whole journey; the weight would be\r\ntoo great.\r\n\r\n“This morning, our last on the ship, the weather was clear, with a\r\ngentle south-south-easterly to south-south-westerly breeze. From the\r\ncrow’s-nest there was no sign of land of any sort. The pressure was\r\nincreasing steadily, and the passing hours brought no relief or respite\r\nfor the ship. The attack of the ice reached its climax at 4 p.m. The\r\nship was hove stern up by the pressure, and the driving floe, moving\r\nlaterally across the stern, split the rudder and tore out the\r\nrudder-post and stern-post. Then, while we watched, the ice loosened\r\nand the _Endurance_ sank a little. The decks were breaking upwards and\r\nthe water was pouring in below. Again the pressure began, and at 5 p.m.\r\nI ordered all hands on to the ice. The twisting, grinding floes were\r\nworking their will at last on the ship. It was a sickening sensation to\r\nfeel the decks breaking up under one’s feet, the great beams bending\r\nand then snapping with a noise like heavy gunfire. The water was\r\novermastering the pumps, and to avoid an explosion when it reached the\r\nboilers I had to give orders for the fires to be drawn and the steam\r\nlet down. The plans for abandoning the ship in case of emergency had\r\nbeen made well in advance, and men and dogs descended to the floe and\r\nmade their way to the comparative safety of an unbroken portion of the\r\nfloe without a hitch. Just before leaving, I looked down the\r\nengine-room skylight as I stood on the quivering deck, and saw the\r\nengines dropping sideways as the stays and bed-plates gave way. I\r\ncannot describe the impression of relentless destruction that was\r\nforced upon me as I looked down and around. The floes, with the force\r\nof millions of tons of moving ice behind them, were simply annihilating\r\nthe ship.”\r\n\r\nEssential supplies had been placed on the floe about 100 yds. from the\r\nship, and there we set about making a camp for the night. But about 7\r\np.m., after the tents were up, the ice we were occupying became\r\ninvolved in the pressure and started to split and smash beneath our\r\nfeet. I had the camp moved to a bigger floe about 200 yds. away, just\r\nbeyond the bow of the ship. Boats, stores, and camp equipment had to be\r\nconveyed across a working pressure-ridge. The movement of the ice was\r\nso slow that it did not interfere much with our short trek, but the\r\nweight of the ridge had caused the floes to sink on either side and\r\nthere were pools of water there. A pioneer party with picks and shovels\r\nhad to build a snow-causeway before we could get all our possessions\r\nacross. By 8 p.m. the camp had been pitched again. We had two\r\npole-tents and three hoop-tents. I took charge of the small pole-tent,\r\nNo. 1, with Hudson, Hurley, and James as companions; Wild had the small\r\nhoop-tent, No. 2, with Wordie, McNeish, and McIlroy. These hoop-tents\r\nare very easily shifted and set up. The eight forward hands had the\r\nlarge hoop-tent, No. 3; Crean had charge of No. 4 hoop-tent with\r\nHussey, Marston, and Cheetham; and Worsley had the other pole-tent, No.\r\n5, with Greenstreet, Lees, Clark, Kerr, Rickenson, Macklin, and\r\nBlackborrow, the last named being the youngest of the forward hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “The Driving Floe, moving laterally across the Stern,\r\nsplit the Rudder and tore out the Rudder-Post and Stern-Post”]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The End]\r\n\r\n\r\n“To-night the temperature has dropped to –16° Fahr., and most of the\r\nmen are cold and uncomfortable. After the tents had been pitched I\r\nmustered all hands and explained the position to them briefly and, I\r\nhope, clearly. I have told them the distance to the Barrier and the\r\ndistance to Paulet Island, and have stated that I propose to try to\r\nmarch with equipment across the ice in the direction of Paulet Island.\r\nI thanked the men for the steadiness and good morale they have shown in\r\nthese trying circumstances, and told them I had no doubt that, provided\r\nthey continued to work their utmost and to trust me, we will all reach\r\nsafety in the end. Then we had supper, which the cook had prepared at\r\nthe big blubber-stove, and after a watch had been set all hands except\r\nthe watch turned in.” For myself, I could not sleep. The destruction\r\nand abandonment of the ship was no sudden shock. The disaster had been\r\nlooming ahead for many months, and I had studied my plans for all\r\ncontingencies a hundred times. But the thoughts that came to me as I\r\nwalked up and down in the darkness were not particularly cheerful. The\r\ntask now was to secure the safety of the party, and to that I must bend\r\nmy energies and mental power and apply every bit of knowledge that\r\nexperience of the Antarctic had given me. The task was likely to be\r\nlong and strenuous, and an ordered mind and a clear programme were\r\nessential if we were to come through without loss of life. A man must\r\nshape himself to a new mark directly the old one goes to ground.\r\n\r\nAt midnight I was pacing the ice, listening to the grinding floe and to\r\nthe groans and crashes that told of the death-agony of the _Endurance_,\r\nwhen I noticed suddenly a crack running across our floe right through\r\nthe camp. The alarm-whistle brought all hands tumbling out, and we\r\nmoved the tents and stores lying on what was now the smaller portion of\r\nthe floe to the larger portion. Nothing more could be done at that\r\nmoment, and the men turned in again; but there was little sleep. Each\r\ntime I came to the end of my beat on the floe I could just see in the\r\ndarkness the uprearing piles of pressure-ice, which toppled over and\r\nnarrowed still further the little floating island we occupied. I did\r\nnot notice at the time that my tent, which had been on the wrong side\r\nof the crack, had not been erected again. Hudson and James had managed\r\nto squeeze themselves into other tents, and Hurley had wrapped himself\r\nin the canvas of No. 1 tent. I discovered this about 5 a.m. All night\r\nlong the electric light gleamed from the stern of the dying\r\n_Endurance_. Hussey had left this light switched on when he took a last\r\nobservation, and, like a lamp in a cottage window, it braved the night\r\nuntil in the early morning the _Endurance_ received a particularly\r\nviolent squeeze. There was a sound of rending beams and the light\r\ndisappeared. The connexion had been cut.\r\n\r\nMorning came in chill and cheerless. All hands were stiff and weary\r\nafter their first disturbed night on the floe. Just at daybreak I went\r\nover to the _Endurance_ with Wild and Hurley, in order to retrieve some\r\ntins of petrol that could be used to boil up milk for the rest of the\r\nmen. The ship presented a painful spectacle of chaos and wreck. The\r\njib-boom and bowsprit had snapped off during the night and now lay at\r\nright angles to the ship, with the chains, martingale, and bob-stay\r\ndragging them as the vessel quivered and moved in the grinding pack.\r\nThe ice had driven over the forecastle and she was well down by the\r\nhead. We secured two tins of petrol with some difficulty, and postponed\r\nthe further examination of the ship until after breakfast. Jumping\r\nacross cracks with the tins, we soon reached camp, and built a\r\nfireplace out of the triangular water-tight tanks we had ripped from\r\nthe lifeboat. This we had done in order to make more room. Then we\r\npierced a petrol-tin in half a dozen places with an ice-axe and set\r\nfire to it. The petrol blazed fiercely under the five-gallon drum we\r\nused as a cooker, and the hot milk was ready in quick time. Then we\r\nthree ministering angels went round the tents with the life-giving\r\ndrink, and were surprised and a trifle chagrined at the matter-of-fact\r\nmanner in which some of the men accepted this contribution to their\r\ncomfort. They did not quite understand what work we had done for them\r\nin the early dawn, and I heard Wild say, “If any of you gentlemen would\r\nlike your boots cleaned just put them outside.” This was his gentle way\r\nof reminding them that a little thanks will go a long way on such\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nThe cook prepared breakfast, which consisted of biscuit and hoosh, at 8\r\na.m., and I then went over to the _Endurance_ again and made a fuller\r\nexamination of the wreck. Only six of the cabins had not been pierced\r\nby floes and blocks of ice. Every one of the starboard cabins had been\r\ncrushed. The whole of the after part of the ship had been crushed\r\nconcertina fashion. The forecastle and the Ritz were submerged, and the\r\nwardroom was three-quarters full of ice. The starboard side of the\r\nwardroom had come away. The motor-engine forward had been driven\r\nthrough the galley. Petrol-cases that had been stacked on the fore-deck\r\nhad been driven by the floe through the wall into the wardroom and had\r\ncarried before them a large picture. Curiously enough, the glass of\r\nthis picture had not been cracked, whereas in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood I saw heavy iron davits that had been twisted and bent\r\nlike the ironwork of a wrecked train. The ship was being crushed\r\nremorselessly.\r\n\r\nUnder a dull, overcast sky I returned to camp and examined our\r\nsituation. The floe occupied by the camp was still subject to pressure,\r\nand I thought it wise to move to a larger and apparently stronger floe\r\nabout 200 yds. away, off the starboard bow of the ship. This camp was\r\nto become known as Dump Camp, owing to the amount of stuff that was\r\nthrown away there. We could not afford to carry unnecessary gear, and a\r\ndrastic sorting of equipment took place. I decided to issue a complete\r\nnew set of Burberrys and underclothing to each man, and also a supply\r\nof new socks. The camp was transferred to the larger floe quickly, and\r\nI began there to direct the preparations for the long journey across\r\nthe floes to Paulet Island or Snow Hill.\r\n\r\nHurley meanwhile had rigged his kinematograph-camera and was getting\r\npictures of the _Endurance_ in her death-throes. While he was engaged\r\nthus, the ice, driving against the standing rigging and the fore-,\r\nmain- and mizzen-masts, snapped the shrouds. The foretop and\r\ntopgallant-mast came down with a run and hung in wreckage on the\r\nfore-mast, with the fore-yard vertical. The main-mast followed\r\nimmediately, snapping off about 10 ft. above the main deck. The\r\ncrow’s-nest fell within 10 ft. of where Hurley stood turning the handle\r\nof his camera, but he did not stop the machine, and so secured a\r\nunique, though sad, picture.\r\n\r\nThe issue of clothing was quickly accomplished. Sleeping-bags were\r\nrequired also. We had eighteen fur bags, and it was necessary,\r\ntherefore, to issue ten of the Jaeger woollen bags in order to provide\r\nfor the twenty-eight men of the party. The woollen bags were lighter\r\nand less warm than the reindeer bags, and so each man who received one\r\nof them was allowed also a reindeer-skin to lie upon. It seemed fair to\r\ndistribute the fur bags by lot, but some of us older hands did not join\r\nin the lottery. We thought we could do quite as well with the Jaegers\r\nas with the furs. With quick dispatch the clothing was apportioned, and\r\nthen we turned one of the boats on its side and supported it with two\r\nbroken oars to make a lee for the galley. The cook got the\r\nblubber-stove going, and a little later, when I was sitting round the\r\ncorner of the stove, I heard one man say, “Cook, I like my tea strong.”\r\nAnother joined in, “Cook, I like mine weak.” It was pleasant to know\r\nthat their minds were untroubled, but I thought the time opportune to\r\nmention that the tea would be the same for all hands and that we would\r\nbe fortunate if two months later we had any tea at all. It occurred to\r\nme at the time that the incident had psychological interest. Here were\r\nmen, their home crushed, the camp pitched on the unstable floes, and\r\ntheir chance of reaching safety apparently remote, calmly attending to\r\nthe details of existence and giving their attention to such trifles as\r\nthe strength of a brew of tea.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon the work continued. Every now and then we heard a\r\nnoise like heavy guns or distant thunder, caused by the floes grinding\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n“The pressure caused by the congestion in this area of the pack is\r\nproducing a scene of absolute chaos. The floes grind stupendously,\r\nthrow up great ridges, and shatter one another mercilessly. The ridges,\r\nor hedgerows, marking the pressure-lines that border the\r\nfast-diminishing pieces of smooth floe-ice, are enormous. The ice moves\r\nmajestically, irresistibly. Human effort is not futile, but man fights\r\nagainst the giant forces of Nature in a spirit of humility. One has a\r\nsense of dependence on the higher Power. To-day two seals, a Weddell\r\nand a crabeater, came close to the camp and were shot. Four others were\r\nchased back into the water, for their presence disturbed the dog teams,\r\nand this meant floggings and trouble with the harness. The arrangement\r\nof the tents has been completed and their internal management settled.\r\nEach tent has a mess orderly, the duty being taken in turn on an\r\nalphabetical rota. The orderly takes the hoosh-pots of his tent to the\r\ngalley, gets all the hoosh he is allowed, and, after the meal, cleans\r\nthe vessels with snow and stores them in sledge or boat ready for a\r\npossible move.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Week Later]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “The Wreckage lies around in Dismal Confusion”]\r\n\r\n\r\n“_October_ 29.—We passed a quiet night, although the pressure was\r\ngrinding around us. Our floe is a heavy one and it withstood the blows\r\nit received. There is a light wind from the north-west to\r\nnorth-north-west, and the weather is fine. We are twenty-eight men with\r\nforty-nine dogs, including Sue’s and Sallie’s five grown-up pups. All\r\nhands this morning were busy preparing gear, fitting boats on sledges,\r\nand building up and strengthening the sledges to carry the boats....\r\nThe main motor-sledge, with a little fitting from the carpenter,\r\ncarried our largest boat admirably. For the next boat four ordinary\r\nsledges were lashed together, but we were dubious as to the strength of\r\nthis contrivance, and as a matter of fact it broke down quickly under\r\nstrain.... The ship is still afloat, with the spurs of the pack driven\r\nthrough her and holding her up. The forecastle-head is under water, the\r\ndecks are burst up by the pressure, the wreckage lies around in dismal\r\nconfusion, but over all the blue ensign flies still.\r\n\r\n“This afternoon Sallie’s three youngest pups, Sue’s Sirius, and Mrs.\r\nChippy, the carpenter’s cat, have to be shot. We could not undertake\r\nthe maintenance of weaklings under the new conditions. Macklin, Crean,\r\nand the carpenter seemed to feel the loss of their friends rather\r\nbadly. We propose making a short trial journey to-morrow, starting with\r\ntwo of the boats and the ten sledges. The number of dog teams has been\r\nincreased to seven, Greenstreet taking charge of the new additional\r\nteam, consisting of Snapper and Sallie’s four oldest pups. We have ten\r\nworking sledges to relay with five teams. Wild’s and Hurley’s teams\r\nwill haul the cutter with the assistance of four men. The whaler and\r\nthe other boats will follow, and the men who are hauling them will be\r\nable to help with the cutter at the rough places. We cannot hope to\r\nmake rapid progress, but each mile counts. Crean this afternoon has a\r\nbad attack of snow-blindness.”\r\n\r\nThe weather on the morning of October 30 was overcast and misty, with\r\noccasional falls of snow. A moderate north-easterly breeze was blowing.\r\nWe were still living on extra food, brought from the ship when we\r\nabandoned her, and the sledging and boating rations were intact. These\r\nrations would provide for twenty-eight men for fifty-six days on full\r\nrations, but we could count on getting enough seal and penguin meat to\r\nat least double this time. We could even, if progress proved too\r\ndifficult and too injurious to the boats, which we must guard as our\r\nultimate means of salvation, camp on the nearest heavy floe, scour the\r\nneighbouring pack for penguins and seals, and await the outward rift of\r\nthe pack, to open and navigable water.\r\n\r\n“This plan would avoid the grave dangers we are now incurring of\r\ngetting entangled in impassable pressure-ridges and possibly\r\nirretrievably damaging the boats, which are bound to suffer in rough\r\nice; it would also minimize the peril of the ice splitting under us, as\r\nit did twice during the night at our first camp. Yet I feel sure that\r\nit is the right thing to attempt a march, since if we can make five or\r\nseven miles a day to the north-west our chance of reaching safety in\r\nthe months to come will be increased greatly. There is a psychological\r\naspect to the question also. It will be much better for the men in\r\ngeneral to feel that, even though progress is slow, they are on their\r\nway to land than it will be simply to sit down and wait for the tardy\r\nnorth-westerly drift to take us out of this cruel waste of ice. We will\r\nmake an attempt to move. The issue is beyond my power either to predict\r\nor to control.”\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Wild and I went out in the mist and snow to find a road\r\nto the north-east. After many devious turnings to avoid the heavier\r\npressure-ridges, we pioneered a way for at least a mile and a half. and\r\nthen returned by a rather better route to the camp. The pressure now\r\nwas rapid in movement and our floe was suffering from the shakes and\r\njerks of the ice. At 3 p.m., after lunch, we got under way, leaving\r\nDump Camp a mass of debris. The order was that personal gear must not\r\nexceed two pounds per man, and this meant that nothing but bare\r\nnecessaries was to be taken on the march. We could not afford to cumber\r\nourselves with unnecessary weight. Holes had been dug in the snow for\r\nthe reception of private letters and little personal trifles, the Lares\r\nand Penates of the members of the Expedition, and into the privacy of\r\nthese white graves were consigned much of sentimental value and not a\r\nlittle of intrinsic worth. I rather grudged the two pounds allowance\r\nper man, owing to my keen anxiety to keep weights at a minimum, but\r\nsome personal belongings could fairly be regarded as indispensable. The\r\njourney might be a long one, and there was a possibility of a winter in\r\nimprovised quarters on an inhospitable coast at the other end. A man\r\nunder such conditions needs something to occupy his thoughts, some\r\ntangible memento of his home and people beyond the seas. So sovereigns\r\nwere thrown away and photographs were kept. I tore the fly-leaf out of\r\nthe Bible that Queen Alexandra had given to the ship, with her own\r\nwriting in it, and also the wonderful page of Job containing the verse:\r\n\r\nOut of whose womb came the ice?\r\nAnd the hoary frost of Heaven, who hath gendered it?\r\nThe waters are hid as with a stone,\r\nAnd the face of the deep is frozen.\r\n—[Job 38:29–30]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other Bible, which Queen Alexandra had given for the use of the\r\nshore party, was down below in the lower hold in one of the cases when\r\nthe ship received her death-blow. Suitcases were thrown away; these\r\nwere retrieved later as material for making boots, and some of them,\r\nmarked “solid leather,” proved, to our disappointment, to contain a\r\nlarge percentage of cardboard. The manufacturer would have had\r\ndifficulty in convincing us at the time that the deception was anything\r\nshort of criminal.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer sledge party, consisting of Wordie, Hussey, Hudson, and\r\nmyself, carrying picks and shovels, started to break a road through the\r\npressure-ridges for the sledges carrying the boats. The boats, with\r\ntheir gear and the sledges beneath them, weighed each more than a ton.\r\nThe cutter was smaller than the whaler, but weighed more and was a much\r\nmore strongly built boat. The whaler was mounted on the sledge part of\r\nthe Girling tractor forward and two sledges amidships and aft. These\r\nsledges were strengthened with cross-timbers and shortened oars fore\r\nand aft. The cutter was mounted on the aero-sledge. The sledges were\r\nthe point of weakness. It appeared almost hopeless to prevent them\r\nsmashing under their heavy loads when travelling over rough\r\npressure-ice which stretched ahead of us for probably 300 miles. After\r\nthe pioneer sledge had started the seven dog teams got off. They took\r\ntheir sledges forward for half a mile, then went back for the other\r\nsledges. Worsley took charge of the two boats, with fifteen men\r\nhauling, and these also had to be relayed. It was heavy work for dogs\r\nand men, but there were intervals of comparative rest on the backward\r\njourney, after the first portion of the load had been taken forward. We\r\npassed over two opening cracks, through which killers were pushing\r\ntheir ugly snouts, and by 5 p.m. had covered a mile in a\r\nnorth-north-westerly direction. The condition of the ice ahead was\r\nchaotic, for since the morning increased pressure had developed and the\r\npack was moving and crushing in all directions. So I gave the order to\r\npitch camp for the night on flat ice, which, unfortunately, proved to\r\nbe young and salty. The older pack was too rough and too deeply laden\r\nwith snow to offer a suitable camping-ground. Although we had gained\r\nonly one mile in a direct line, the necessary deviations made the\r\ndistance travelled at least two miles, and the relays brought the\r\ndistance marched up to six miles. Some of the dog teams had covered at\r\nleast ten miles. I set the watch from 6 p.m. to 7 a.m., one hour for\r\neach man in each tent in rotation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The First Attempt to reach the Land 346 Miles Away]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ocean Camp]\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the night snow fell heavily, and the floor-cloths of the tents\r\ngot wet through, as the temperature had risen to +25° Fahr. One of the\r\nthings we hoped for in those days was a temperature in the\r\nneighbourhood of zero, for then the snow surface would be hard, we\r\nwould not be troubled by damp, and our gear would not become covered in\r\nsoft snow. The killers were blowing all night, and a crack appeared\r\nabout 20 ft. from the camp at 2 a.m. The ice below us was quite thin\r\nenough for the killers to break through if they took a fancy to do so,\r\nbut there was no other camping-ground within our reach and we had to\r\ntake the risk. When morning came the snow was falling so heavily that\r\nwe could not see more than a few score yards ahead, and I decided not\r\nto strike camp. A path over the shattered floes would be hard to find,\r\nand to get the boats into a position of peril might be disastrous.\r\nRickenson and Worsley started back for Dump Camp at 7 a.m. to get some\r\nwood and blubber for the fire, and an hour later we had hoosh, with one\r\nbiscuit each. At 10 a.m. Hurley and Hudson left for the old camp in\r\norder to bring some additional dog-pemmican, since there were no seals\r\nto be found near us. Then, as the weather cleared, Worsley and I made a\r\nprospect to the west and tried to find a practicable road. A large floe\r\noffered a fairly good road for at least another mile to the north-west,\r\nand we went back prepared for another move. The weather cleared a\r\nlittle, and after lunch we struck camp. I took Rickenson, Kerr, Wordie,\r\nand Hudson as a breakdown gang to pioneer a path among the\r\npressure-ridges. Five dog teams followed. Wild’s and Hurley’s teams\r\nwere hitched on to the cutter and they started off in splendid style.\r\nThey needed to be helped only once; indeed fourteen dogs did as well or\r\neven better than eighteen men. The ice was moving beneath and around us\r\nas we worked towards the big floe, and where this floe met the smaller\r\nones there was a mass of pressed-up ice, still in motion, with water\r\nbetween the ridges. But it is wonderful what a dozen men can do with\r\npicks and shovels. We could cut a road through a pressure-ridge about\r\n14 ft. high in ten minutes and leave a smooth, or comparatively smooth,\r\npath for the sledges and teams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nOCEAN CAMP\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the wet, deep snow and the halts occasioned by thus having\r\nto cut our road through the pressure-ridges, we managed to march the\r\nbest part of a mile towards our goal, though the relays and the\r\ndeviations again made the actual distance travelled nearer six miles.\r\nAs I could see that the men were all exhausted I gave the order to\r\npitch the tents under the lee of the two boats, which afforded some\r\nslight protection from the wet snow now threatening to cover\r\neverything. While so engaged one of the sailors discovered a small pool\r\nof water, caused by the snow having thawed on a sail which was lying in\r\none of the boats. There was not much—just a sip each; but, as one man\r\nwrote in his diary, “One has seen and tasted cleaner, but seldom more\r\nopportunely found water.”\r\n\r\nNext day broke cold and still with the same wet snow, and in the\r\nclearing light I could see that with the present loose surface, and\r\nconsidering how little result we had to show for all our strenuous\r\nefforts of the past four days, it would be impossible to proceed for\r\nany great distance. Taking into account also the possibility of leads\r\nopening close to us, and so of our being able to row north-west to\r\nwhere we might find land, I decided to find a more solid floe and there\r\ncamp until conditions were more favourable for us to make a second\r\nattempt to escape from our icy prison. To this end we moved our tents\r\nand all our gear to a thick, heavy old floe about one and a half miles\r\nfrom the wreck and there made our camp. We called this “Ocean Camp.” It\r\nwas with the utmost difficulty that we shifted our two boats. The\r\nsurface was terrible—like nothing that any of us had ever seen around\r\nus before. We were sinking at times up to our hips, and everywhere the\r\nsnow was two feet deep.\r\n\r\nI decided to conserve our valuable sledging rations, which would be so\r\nnecessary for the inevitable boat journey, as much as possible, and to\r\nsubsist almost entirely on seals and penguins.\r\n\r\nA party was sent back to Dump Camp, near the ship, to collect as much\r\nclothing, tobacco, etc., as they could find. The heavy snow which had\r\nfallen in the last few days, combined with the thawing and consequent\r\nsinking of the surface, resulted in the total disappearance of a good\r\nmany of the things left behind at this dump. The remainder of the men\r\nmade themselves as comfortable as possible under the circumstances at\r\nOcean Camp. This floating lump of ice, about a mile square at first but\r\nlater splitting into smaller and smaller fragments, was to be our home\r\nfor nearly two months. During these two months we made frequent visits\r\nto the vicinity of the ship and retrieved much valuable clothing and\r\nfood and some few articles of personal value which in our light-hearted\r\noptimism we had thought to leave miles behind us on our dash across the\r\nmoving ice to safety.\r\n\r\nThe collection of food was now the all-important consideration. As we\r\nwere to subsist almost entirely on seals and penguins, which were to\r\nprovide fuel as well as food, some form of blubber-stove was a\r\nnecessity. This was eventually very ingeniously contrived from the\r\nship’s steel ash-shoot, as our first attempt with a large iron oil-drum\r\ndid not prove eminently successful. We could only cook seal or penguin\r\nhooshes or stews on this stove, and so uncertain was its action that\r\nthe food was either burnt or only partially cooked; and, hungry though\r\nwe were, half-raw seal meat was not very appetizing. On one occasion a\r\nwonderful stew made from seal meat, with two or three tins of Irish\r\nstew that had been salved from the ship, fell into the fire through the\r\nbottom of the oil-drum that we used as a saucepan becoming burnt out on\r\naccount of the sudden intense heat of the fire below. We lunched that\r\nday on one biscuit and a quarter of a tin of bully-beef each, frozen\r\nhard.\r\n\r\nThis new stove, which was to last us during our stay at Ocean Camp, was\r\na great success. Two large holes were punched, with much labour and few\r\ntools, opposite one another at the wider or top end of the shoot. Into\r\none of these an oil-drum was fixed, to be used as the fireplace, the\r\nother hole serving to hold our saucepan. Alongside this another hole\r\nwas punched to enable two saucepans to be boiled at a time; and farther\r\nalong still a chimney made from biscuit-tins completed a very\r\nefficient, if not a very elegant, stove. Later on the cook found that\r\nhe could bake a sort of flat bannock or scone on this stove, but he was\r\nseriously hampered for want of yeast or baking-powder.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was next made to erect some sort of a galley to protect the\r\ncook against the inclemencies of the weather. The party which I had\r\nsent back under Wild to the ship returned with, amongst other things,\r\nthe wheel-house practically complete. This, with the addition of some\r\nsails and tarpaulins stretched on spars, made a very comfortable\r\nstorehouse and galley. Pieces of planking from the deck were lashed\r\nacross some spars stuck upright into the snow, and this, with the\r\nship’s binnacle, formed an excellent look-out from which to look for\r\nseals and penguins. On this platform, too, a mast was erected from\r\nwhich flew the King’s flag and the Royal Clyde Yacht Club burgee.\r\n\r\nI made a strict inventory of all the food in our possession, weights\r\nbeing roughly determined with a simple balance made from a piece of\r\nwood and some string, the counter-weight being a 60-lb. box of\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nThe dog teams went off to the wreck early each morning under Wild, and\r\nthe men made every effort to rescue as much as possible from the ship.\r\nThis was an extremely difficult task as the whole of the deck forward\r\nwas under a foot of water on the port side, and nearly three feet on\r\nthe starboard side. However, they managed to collect large quantities\r\nof wood and ropes and some few cases of provisions. Although the galley\r\nwas under water, Bakewell managed to secure three or four saucepans,\r\nwhich later proved invaluable acquisitions. Quite a number of boxes of\r\nflour, etc., had been stowed in a cabin in the hold, and these we had\r\nbeen unable to get out before we left the ship. Having, therefore,\r\ndetermined as nearly as possible that portion of the deck immediately\r\nabove these cases, we proceeded to cut a hole with large ice-chisels\r\nthrough the 3-in. planking of which it was formed. As the ship at this\r\nspot was under 5 ft. of water and ice, it was not an easy job. However,\r\nwe succeeded in making the hole sufficiently large to allow of some few\r\ncases to come floating up. These were greeted with great satisfaction,\r\nand later on, as we warmed to our work, other cases, whose upward\r\nprogress was assisted with a boat-hook, were greeted with either cheers\r\nor groans according to whether they contained farinaceous food or\r\nmerely luxuries such as jellies. For each man by now had a good idea of\r\nthe calorific value and nutritive and sustaining qualities of the\r\nvarious foods. It had a personal interest for us all. In this way we\r\nadded to our scanty stock between two and three tons of provisions,\r\nabout half of which was farinaceous food, such as flour and peas, of\r\nwhich we were so short. This sounds a great deal, but at one pound per\r\nday it would only last twenty-eight men for three months. Previous to\r\nthis I had reduced the food allowance to nine and a half ounces per man\r\nper day. Now, however, it could be increased, and “this afternoon, for\r\nthe first time for ten days, we knew what it was to be really\r\nsatisfied.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Look-out at Ocean Camp]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Emergency Sledges being packed in case of a sudden\r\nbreak up of the Ice]\r\n\r\n\r\nI had the sledges packed in readiness with the special sledging rations\r\nin case of a sudden move, and with the other food, allowing also for\r\nprospective seals and penguins, I calculated a dietary to give the\r\nutmost possible variety and yet to use our precious stock of flour in\r\nthe most economical manner. All seals and penguins that appeared\r\nanywhere within the vicinity of the camp were killed to provide food\r\nand fuel. The dog-pemmican we also added to our own larder, feeding the\r\ndogs on the seals which we caught, after removing such portions as were\r\nnecessary for our own needs. We were rather short of crockery, but\r\nsmall pieces of venesta-wood served admirably as plates for seal\r\nsteaks; stews and liquids of all sorts were served in the aluminium\r\nsledging-mugs, of which each man had one. Later on, jelly-tins and\r\nbiscuit-tin lids were pressed into service.\r\n\r\nMonotony in the meals, even considering the circumstances in which we\r\nfound ourselves, was what I was striving to avoid, so our little stock\r\nof luxuries, such as fish-paste, tinned herrings, etc., was carefully\r\nhusbanded and so distributed as to last as long as possible. My efforts\r\nwere not in vain, as one man states in his diary: “It must be admitted\r\nthat we are feeding very well indeed, considering our position. Each\r\nmeal consists of one course and a beverage. The dried vegetables, if\r\nany, all go into the same pot as the meat, and every dish is a sort of\r\nhash or stew, be it ham or seal meat or half and half. The fact that we\r\nonly have two pots available places restrictions upon the number of\r\nthings that can be cooked at one time, but in spite of the limitation\r\nof facilities, we always seem to manage to get just enough. The\r\nmilk-powder and sugar are necessarily boiled with the tea or cocoa.\r\n\r\n“We are, of course, very short of the farinaceous element in our diet,\r\nand consequently have a mild craving for more of it. Bread is out of\r\nthe question, and as we are husbanding the remaining cases of our\r\nbiscuits for our prospective boat journey, we are eking out the supply\r\nof flour by making bannocks, of which we have from three to four each\r\nday. These bannocks are made from flour, fat, water, salt, and a little\r\nbaking-powder, the dough being rolled out into flat rounds and baked in\r\nabout ten minutes on a hot sheet of iron over the fire. Each bannock\r\nweighs about one and a half to two ounces, and we are indeed lucky to\r\nbe able to produce them.”\r\n\r\nA few boxes of army biscuits soaked with sea-water were distributed at\r\none meal. They were in such a state that they would not have been\r\nlooked at a second time under ordinary circumstances, but to us on a\r\nfloating lump of ice, over three hundred miles from land, and that\r\nquite hypothetical, and with the unplumbed sea beneath us, they were\r\nluxuries indeed. Wild’s tent made a pudding of theirs with some\r\ndripping.\r\n\r\nAlthough keeping in mind the necessity for strict economy with our\r\nscanty store of food, I knew how important it was to keep the men\r\ncheerful, and that the depression occasioned by our surroundings and\r\nour precarious position could to some extent be alleviated by\r\nincreasing the rations, at least until we were more accustomed to our\r\nnew mode of life. That this was successful is shown in their diaries.\r\n\r\n“Day by day goes by much the same as one another. We work; we talk; we\r\neat. Ah, how we eat! No longer on short rations, we are a trifle more\r\nexacting than we were when we first commenced our ‘simple life,’ but by\r\ncomparison with home standards we are positive barbarians, and our\r\ngastronomic rapacity knows no bounds.\r\n\r\n“All is eaten that comes to each tent, and everything is most carefully\r\nand accurately divided into as many equal portions as there are men in\r\nthe tent. One member then closes his eyes or turns his head away and\r\ncalls out the names at random, as the cook for the day points to each\r\nportion, saying at the same time, ‘Whose?’\r\n\r\n“Partiality, however unintentional it may be, is thus entirely obviated\r\nand every one feels satisfied that all is fair, even though one may\r\nlook a little enviously at the next man’s helping, which differs in\r\nsome especially appreciated detail from one’s own. We break the Tenth\r\nCommandment energetically, but as we are all in the same boat in this\r\nrespect, no one says a word. We understand each other’s feelings quite\r\nsympathetically.\r\n\r\n“It is just like school-days over again, and very jolly it is too, for\r\nthe time being!”\r\n\r\nLater on, as the prospect of wintering in the pack became more\r\napparent, the rations had to be considerably reduced. By that time,\r\nhowever, everybody had become more accustomed to the idea and took it\r\nquite as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nOur meals now consisted in the main of a fairly generous helping of\r\nseal or penguin, either boiled or fried. As one man wrote:\r\n\r\n“We are now having enough to eat, but not by any means too much; and\r\nevery one is always hungry enough to eat every scrap he can get. Meals\r\nare invariably taken very seriously, and little talking is done till\r\nthe hoosh is finished.”\r\n\r\nOur tents made somewhat cramped quarters, especially during meal-times.\r\n\r\n“Living in a tent without any furniture requires a little getting used\r\nto. For our meals we have to sit on the floor, and it is surprising how\r\nawkward it is to eat in such a position; it is better by far to kneel\r\nand sit back on one’s heels, as do the Japanese.”\r\n\r\nEach man took it in turn to be the tent “cook” for one day, and one\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n“The word ‘cook’ is at present rather a misnomer, for whilst we have a\r\npermanent galley no cooking need be done in the tent.\r\n\r\n“Really, all that the tent cook has to do is to take his two hoosh-pots\r\nover to the galley and convey the hoosh and the beverage to the tent,\r\nclearing up after each meal and washing up the two pots and the mugs.\r\nThere are no spoons, etc., to wash, for we each keep our own spoon and\r\npocket-knife in our pockets. We just lick them as clean as possible and\r\nreplace them in our pockets after each meal.\r\n\r\n“Our spoons are one of our indispensable possessions here. To lose\r\none’s spoon would be almost as serious as it is for an edentate person\r\nto lose his set of false teeth.”\r\n\r\nDuring all this time the supply of seals and penguins, if not\r\ninexhaustible, was always sufficient for our needs.\r\n\r\nSeal- and penguin-hunting was our daily occupation, and parties were\r\nsent out in different directions to search among the hummocks and the\r\npressure-ridges for them. When one was found a signal was hoisted,\r\nusually in the form of a scarf or a sock on a pole, and an answering\r\nsignal was hoisted at the camp.\r\n\r\nThen Wild went out with a dog team to shoot and bring in the game. To\r\nfeed ourselves and the dogs, at least one seal a day was required. The\r\nseals were mostly crab-eaters, and emperor penguins were the general\r\nrule. On November 5, however, an adelie was caught, and this was the\r\ncause of much discussion, as the following extract shows: “The man on\r\nwatch from 3 a.m. to 4 a.m. caught an adelie penguin. This is the first\r\nof its kind that we have seen since January last, and it may mean a\r\nlot. It may signify that there is land somewhere near us, or else that\r\ngreat leads are opening up, but it is impossible to form more than a\r\nmere conjecture at present.”\r\n\r\nNo skuas, Antarctic petrels, or sea-leopards were seen during our two\r\nmonths’ stay at Ocean Camp.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the daily hunt for food, our time was passed in reading\r\nthe few books that we had managed to save from the ship. The greatest\r\ntreasure in the library was a portion of the “Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica.” This was being continually used to settle the inevitable\r\narguments that would arise. The sailors were discovered one day engaged\r\nin a very heated discussion on the subject of _Money and Exchange_.\r\nThey finally came to the conclusion that the Encyclopædia, since it\r\ndid not coincide with their views, must be wrong.\r\n\r\n“For descriptions of every American town that ever has been, is, or\r\never will be, and for full and complete biographies of every American\r\nstatesman since the time of George Washington and long before, the\r\nEncyclopædia would be hard to beat. Owing to our shortage of matches\r\nwe have been driven to use it for purposes other than the purely\r\nliterary ones though; and one genius having discovered that the paper,\r\nused for its pages had been impregnated with saltpetre, we can now\r\nthoroughly recommend it as a very efficient pipe-lighter.”\r\n\r\nWe also possessed a few books on Antarctic exploration, a copy of\r\nBrowning and one of “The Ancient Mariner.” On reading the latter, we\r\nsympathized with him and wondered what he had done with the albatross;\r\nit would have made a very welcome addition to our larder.\r\n\r\nThe two subjects of most interest to us were our rate of drift and the\r\nweather. Worsley took observations of the sun whenever possible, and\r\nhis results showed conclusively that the drift of our floe was almost\r\nentirely dependent upon the winds and not much affected by currents.\r\nOur hope, of course, was to drift northwards to the edge of the pack\r\nand then, when the ice was loose enough, to take to the boats and row\r\nto the nearest land. We started off in fine style, drifting north about\r\ntwenty miles in two or three days in a howling south-westerly blizzard.\r\nGradually, however, we slowed up, as successive observations showed,\r\nuntil we began to drift back to the south. An increasing north-easterly\r\nwind, which commenced on November 7 and lasted for twelve days, damped\r\nour spirits for a time, until we found that we had only drifted back to\r\nthe south three miles, so that we were now seventeen miles to the good.\r\nThis tended to reassure us in our theories that the ice of the Weddell\r\nSea was drifting round in a clockwise direction, and that if we could\r\nstay on our piece long enough we must eventually be taken up to the\r\nnorth, where lay the open sea and the path to comparative safety.\r\n\r\nThe ice was not moving fast enough to be noticeable. In fact, the only\r\nway in which we could prove that we were moving at all was by noting\r\nthe change of relative positions of the bergs around us, and, more\r\ndefinitely, by fixing our absolute latitude and longitude by\r\nobservations of the sun. Otherwise, as far as actual visible drift was\r\nconcerned, we might have been on dry land.\r\n\r\nFor the next few days we made good progress, drifting seven miles to\r\nthe north on November 24 and another seven miles in the next\r\nforty-eight hours. We were all very pleased to know that although the\r\nwind was mainly south-west all this time, yet we had made very little\r\neasting. The land lay to the west, so had we drifted to the east we\r\nshould have been taken right away to the centre of the entrance to the\r\nWeddell Sea, and our chances of finally reaching land would have been\r\nconsiderably lessened.\r\n\r\nOur average rate of drift was slow, and many and varied were the\r\ncalculations as to when we should reach the pack-edge. On December 12,\r\n1915, one man wrote: “Once across the Antarctic Circle, it will seem as\r\nif we are practically halfway home again; and it is just possible that\r\nwith favourable winds we may cross the circle before the New Year. A\r\ndrift of only three miles a day would do it, and we have often done\r\nthat and more for periods of three or four weeks.\r\n\r\n“We are now only 250 miles from Paulet Island, but too much to the east\r\nof it. We are approaching the latitudes in which we were at this time\r\nlast year, on our way down. The ship left South Georgia just a year and\r\na week ago, and reached this latitude four or five miles to the\r\neastward of our present position on January 3, 1915, crossing the\r\ncircle on New Year’s Eve.”\r\n\r\nThus, after a year’s incessant battle with the ice, we had returned, by\r\nmany strange turns of fortune’s wheel, to almost identically the same\r\nlatitude that we had left with such high hopes and aspirations twelve\r\nmonths previously; but under what different conditions now! Our ship\r\ncrushed and lost, and we ourselves drifting on a piece of ice at the\r\nmercy of the winds. However, in spite of occasional setbacks due to\r\nunfavourable winds, our drift was in the main very satisfactory, and\r\nthis went a long way towards keeping the men cheerful.\r\n\r\nAs the drift was mostly affected by the winds, the weather was closely\r\nwatched by all, and Hussey, the meteorologist, was called upon to make\r\nforecasts every four hours, and some times more frequently than that. A\r\nmeteorological screen, containing thermometers and a barograph, had\r\nbeen erected on a post frozen into the ice, and observations were taken\r\nevery four hours. When we first left the ship the weather was cold and\r\nmiserable, and altogether as unpropitious as it could possibly have\r\nbeen for our attempted march. Our first few days at Ocean Camp were\r\npassed under much the same conditions. At nights the temperature\r\ndropped to zero, with blinding snow and drift. One-hour watches were\r\ninstituted, all hands taking their turn, and in such weather this job\r\nwas no sinecure. The watchman had to be continually on the alert for\r\ncracks in the ice, or any sudden changes in the ice conditions, and\r\nalso had to keep his eye on the dogs, who often became restless,\r\nfretful, and quarrelsome in the early hours of the morning. At the end\r\nof his hour he was very glad to crawl back into the comparative warmth\r\nof his frozen sleeping-bag.\r\n\r\nOn November 6 a dull, overcast day developed into a howling blizzard\r\nfrom the south-west, with snow and low drift. Only those who were\r\ncompelled left the shelter of their tent. Deep drifts formed\r\neverywhere, burying sledges and provisions to a depth of two feet, and\r\nthe snow piling up round the tents threatened to burst the thin fabric.\r\nThe fine drift found its way in through the ventilator of the tent,\r\nwhich was accordingly plugged up with a spare sock.\r\n\r\nThis lasted for two days, when one man wrote: “The blizzard continued\r\nthrough the morning, but cleared towards noon, and it was a beautiful\r\nevening; but we would far rather have the screeching blizzard with its\r\nsearching drift and cold damp wind, for we drifted about eleven miles\r\nto the north during the night.”\r\n\r\nFor four days the fine weather continued, with gloriously warm, bright\r\nsun, but cold when standing still or in the shade. The temperature\r\nusually dropped below zero, but every opportunity was taken during\r\nthese fine, sunny days to partially dry our sleeping-bags and other\r\ngear, which had become sodden through our body-heat having thawed the\r\nsnow which had drifted in on to them during the blizzard. The bright\r\nsun seemed to put new heart into all.\r\n\r\nThe next day brought a north-easterly wind with the very high\r\ntemperature of 27° Fahr.—only 5° below freezing. “These high\r\ntemperatures do not always represent the warmth which might be assumed\r\nfrom the thermometrical readings. They usually bring dull, overcast\r\nskies, with a raw, muggy, moisture-laden wind. The winds from the\r\nsouth, though colder, are nearly always coincident with sunny days and\r\nclear blue skies.”\r\n\r\nThe temperature still continued to rise, reaching 33° Fahr. on November\r\n14. The thaw consequent upon these high temperatures was having a\r\ndisastrous effect upon the surface of our camp. “The surface is\r\nawful!—not slushy, but elusive. You step out gingerly. All is well for\r\na few paces, then your foot suddenly sinks a couple of feet until it\r\ncomes to a hard layer. You wade along in this way step by step, like a\r\nmudlark at Portsmouth Hard, hoping gradually to regain the surface.\r\nSoon you do, only to repeat the exasperating performance _ad lib_., to\r\nthe accompaniment of all the expletives that you can bring to bear on\r\nthe subject. What actually happens is that the warm air melts the\r\nsurface sufficiently to cause drops of water to trickle down slightly,\r\nwhere, on meeting colder layers of snow, they freeze again, forming a\r\nhoneycomb of icy nodules instead of the soft, powdery, granular snow\r\nthat we are accustomed to.”\r\n\r\nThese high temperatures persisted for some days, and when, as\r\noccasionally happened, the sky was clear and the sun was shining it was\r\nunbearably hot. Five men who were sent to fetch some gear from the\r\nvicinity of the ship with a sledge marched in nothing but trousers and\r\nsinglet, and even then were very hot; in fact they were afraid of\r\ngetting sunstroke, so let down flaps from their caps to cover their\r\nnecks. Their sleeves were rolled up over their elbows, and their arms\r\nwere red and sunburnt in consequence. The temperature on this occasion\r\nwas 26° Fahr., or 6° below freezing. For five or six days more the sun\r\ncontinued, and most of our clothes and sleeping-bags were now\r\ncomparatively dry. A wretched day with rainy sleet set in on November\r\n21, but one could put up with this discomfort as the wind was now from\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\nThe wind veered later to the west, and the sun came out at 9 p.m. For\r\nat this time, near the end of November, we had the midnight sun. “A\r\nthrice-blessed southerly wind” soon arrived to cheer us all,\r\noccasioning the following remarks in one of the diaries:\r\n\r\n“To-day is the most beautiful day we have had in the Antarctic—a clear\r\nsky, a gentle, warm breeze from the south, and the most brilliant\r\nsunshine. We all took advantage of it to strike tents, clean out, and\r\ngenerally dry and air ground-sheets and sleeping-bags.”\r\n\r\nI was up early—4 a.m.—to keep watch, and the sight was indeed\r\nmagnificent. Spread out before one was an extensive panorama of\r\nice-fields, intersected here and there by small broken leads, and\r\ndotted with numerous noble bergs, partly bathed in sunshine and partly\r\ntinged with the grey shadows of an overcast sky.\r\n\r\nAs one watched one observed a distinct line of demarcation between the\r\nsunshine and the shade, and this line gradually approached nearer and\r\nnearer, lighting up the hummocky relief of the ice-field bit by bit,\r\nuntil at last it reached us, and threw the whole camp into a blaze of\r\nglorious sunshine which lasted nearly all day.\r\n\r\n“This afternoon we were treated to one or two showers of hail-like\r\nsnow. Yesterday we also had a rare form of snow, or, rather,\r\nprecipitation of ice-spicules, exactly like little hairs, about a third\r\nof an inch long.\r\n\r\n“The warmth in the tents at lunch-time was so great that we had all the\r\nside-flaps up for ventilation, but it is a treat to get warm\r\noccasionally, and one can put up with a little stuffy atmosphere now\r\nand again for the sake of it. The wind has gone to the best quarter\r\nthis evening, the south-east, and is freshening.”\r\n\r\nOn these fine, clear, sunny days wonderful mirage effects could be\r\nobserved, just as occur over the desert. Huge bergs were apparently\r\nresting on nothing, with a distinct gap between their bases and the\r\nhorizon; others were curiously distorted into all sorts of weird and\r\nfantastic shapes, appearing to be many times their proper height. Added\r\nto this, the pure glistening white of the snow and ice made a picture\r\nwhich it is impossible adequately to describe.\r\n\r\nLater on, the freshening south-westerly wind brought mild, overcast\r\nweather, probably due to the opening up of the pack in that direction.\r\n\r\nI had already made arrangements for a quick move in case of a sudden\r\nbreak-up of the ice. Emergency orders were issued; each man had his\r\npost allotted and his duty detailed; and the whole was so organized\r\nthat in less than five minutes from the sounding of the alarm on my\r\nwhistle, tents were struck, gear and provisions packed, and the whole\r\nparty was ready to move off. I now took a final survey of the men to\r\nnote their condition, both mental and physical. For our time at Ocean\r\nCamp had not been one of unalloyed bliss. The loss of the ship meant\r\nmore to us than we could ever put into words. After we had settled at\r\nOcean Camp she still remained nipped by the ice, only her stern showing\r\nand her bows overridden and buried by the relentless pack. The tangled\r\nmass of ropes, rigging, and spars made the scene even more desolate and\r\ndepressing.\r\n\r\nIt was with a feeling almost of relief that the end came.\r\n\r\n“_November_ 21, 1915.—This evening, as we were lying in our tents we\r\nheard the Boss call out, ‘She’s going, boys!’ We were out in a second\r\nand up on the look-out station and other points of vantage, and, sure\r\nenough, there was our poor ship a mile and a half away struggling in\r\nher death-agony. She went down bows first, her stern raised in the air.\r\nShe then gave one quick dive and the ice closed over her for ever. It\r\ngave one a sickening sensation to see it, for, mastless and useless as\r\nshe was, she seemed to be a link with the outer world. Without her our\r\ndestitution seems more emphasized, our desolation more complete. The\r\nloss of the ship sent a slight wave of depression over the camp. No one\r\nsaid much, but we cannot be blamed for feeling it in a sentimental way.\r\nIt seemed as if the moment of severance from many cherished\r\nassociations, many happy moments, even stirring incidents, had come as\r\nshe silently up-ended to find a last resting-place beneath the ice on\r\nwhich we now stand. When one knows every little nook and corner of\r\none’s ship as we did, and has helped her time and again in the fight\r\nthat she made so well, the actual parting was not without its pathos,\r\nquite apart from one’s own desolation, and I doubt if there was one\r\namongst us who did not feel some personal emotion when Sir Ernest,\r\nstanding on the top of the look-out, said somewhat sadly and quietly,\r\n‘She’s gone, boys.’\r\n\r\n“It must, however, be said that we did not give way to depression for\r\nlong, for soon every one was as cheery as usual. Laughter rang out from\r\nthe tents, and even the Boss had a passage-at-arms with the storekeeper\r\nover the inadequacy of the sausage ration, insisting that there should\r\nbe two each ‘because they were such little ones,’ instead of the one\r\nand a half that the latter proposed.”\r\n\r\nThe psychological effect of a slight increase in the rations soon\r\nneutralized any tendency to downheartedness, but with the high\r\ntemperatures surface-thaw set in, and our bags and clothes were soaked\r\nand sodden. Our boots squelched as we walked, and we lived in a state\r\nof perpetual wet feet. At nights, before the temperature had fallen,\r\nclouds of steam could be seen rising from our soaking bags and boots.\r\nDuring the night, as it grew colder, this all condensed as rime on the\r\ninside of the tent, and showered down upon us if one happened to touch\r\nthe side inadvertently. One had to be careful how one walked, too, as\r\noften only a thin crust of ice and snow covered a hole in the floe,\r\nthrough which many an unwary member went in up to his waist. These\r\nperpetual soakings, however, seemed to have had little lasting effect,\r\nor perhaps it was not apparent owing to the excitement of the prospect\r\nof an early release.\r\n\r\nA north-westerly wind on December 7 and 8 retarded our progress\r\nsomewhat, but I had reason to believe that it would help to open the\r\nice and form leads through which we might escape to open water. So I\r\nordered a practice launching of the boats and stowage of food and\r\nstores in them. This was very satisfactory. We cut a slipway from our\r\nfloe into a lead which ran alongside, and the boats took the water\r\n“like a bird,” as one sailor remarked. Our hopes were high in\r\nanticipation of an early release. A blizzard sprang up, increasing the\r\nnext day and burying tents and packing-cases in the drift. On December\r\n12 it had moderated somewhat and veered to the south-east, and the next\r\nday the blizzard had ceased, but a good steady wind from south and\r\nsouth-west continued to blow us north.\r\n\r\n“_December_ 15, 1915.—The continuance of southerly winds is exceeding\r\nour best hopes, and raising our spirits in proportion. Prospects could\r\nnot be brighter than they are just now. The environs of our floe are\r\ncontinually changing. Some days we are almost surrounded by small open\r\nleads, preventing us from crossing over to the adjacent floes.”\r\n\r\nAfter two more days our fortune changed, and a strong north-easterly\r\nwind brought “a beastly cold, windy day” and drove us back three and a\r\nquarter miles. Soon, however, the wind once more veered to the south\r\nand south-west. These high temperatures, combined with the strong\r\nchangeable winds that we had had of late, led me to conclude that the\r\nice all around us was rotting and breaking up and that the moment of\r\nour deliverance from the icy maw of the Antarctic was at hand.\r\n\r\nOn December 20, after discussing the question with Wild, I informed all\r\nhands that I intended to try and make a march to the west to reduce the\r\ndistance between us and Paulet Island. A buzz of pleasurable\r\nanticipation went round the camp, and every one was anxious to get on\r\nthe move. So the next day I set off with Wild, Crean, and Hurley, with\r\ndog teams, to the westward to survey the route. After travelling about\r\nseven miles we mounted a small berg, and there as far as we could see\r\nstretched a series of immense flat floes from half a mile to a mile\r\nacross, separated from each other by pressure-ridges which seemed\r\neasily negotiable with pick and shovel. The only place that appeared\r\nlikely to be formidable was a very much cracked-up area between the old\r\nfloe that we were on and the first of the series of young flat floes\r\nabout half a mile away.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Sledges packed and ready]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Relaying the _James Caird_]\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 22 was therefore kept as Christmas Day, and most of our small\r\nremaining stock of luxuries was consumed at the Christmas feast. We\r\ncould not carry it all with us, so for the last time for eight months\r\nwe had a really good meal—as much as we could eat. Anchovies in oil,\r\nbaked beans, and jugged hare made a glorious mixture such as we have\r\nnot dreamed of since our school-days. Everybody was working at high\r\npressure, packing and repacking sledges and stowing what provisions we\r\nwere going to take with us in the various sacks and boxes. As I looked\r\nround at the eager faces of the men I could not but hope that this time\r\nthe fates would be kinder to us than in our last attempt to march\r\nacross the ice to safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nTHE MARCH BETWEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the night-watchman we turned in at 11 p.m., and\r\nat 3 a.m. on December 23 all hands were roused for the purpose of\r\nsledging the two boats, the _James Caird_ and the _Dudley Docker_, over\r\nthe dangerously cracked portion to the first of the young floes, whilst\r\nthe surface still held its night crust. A thick sea-fog came up from\r\nthe west, so we started off finally at 4.30 a.m., after a drink of hot\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\nPractically all hands had to be harnessed to each boat in succession,\r\nand by dint of much careful manipulation and tortuous courses amongst\r\nthe broken ice we got both safely over the danger-zone.\r\n\r\nWe then returned to Ocean Camp for the tents and the rest of the\r\nsledges, and pitched camp by the boats about one and a quarter miles\r\noff. On the way back a big seal was caught which provided fresh food\r\nfor ourselves and for the dogs. On arrival at the camp a supper of cold\r\ntinned mutton and tea was served, and everybody turned in at 2 p.m. It\r\nwas my intention to sleep by day and march by night, so as to take\r\nadvantage of the slightly lower temperatures and consequent harder\r\nsurfaces.\r\n\r\nAt 8 p.m. the men were roused, and after a meal of cold mutton and tea,\r\nthe march was resumed. A large open lead brought us to a halt at 11\r\np.m., whereupon we camped and turned in without a meal. Fortunately\r\njust at this time the weather was fine and warm. Several men slept out\r\nin the open at the beginning of the march. One night, however, a slight\r\nsnow-shower came on, succeeded immediately by a lowering of the\r\ntemperature. Worsley, who had hung up his trousers and socks on a boat,\r\nfound them iced-up and stiff; and it was quite a painful process for\r\nhim to dress quickly that morning. I was anxious, now that we had\r\nstarted, that we should make every effort to extricate ourselves, and\r\nthis temporary check so early was rather annoying. So that afternoon\r\nWild and I ski-ed out to the crack and found that it had closed up\r\nagain. We marked out the track with small flags as we returned. Each\r\nday, after all hands had turned in, Wild and I would go ahead for two\r\nmiles or so to reconnoitre the next day’s route, marking it with pieces\r\nof wood, tins, and small flags. We had to pick the road which though it\r\nmight be somewhat devious, was flattest and had least hummocks.\r\nPressure-ridges had to be skirted, and where this was not possible the\r\nbest place to make a bridge of ice-blocks across the lead or over the\r\nridge had to be found and marked. It was the duty of the dog-drivers to\r\nthus prepare the track for those who were toiling behind with the heavy\r\nboats. These boats were hauled in relays, about sixty yards at a time.\r\nI did not wish them to be separated by too great a distance in case the\r\nice should crack between them, and we should be unable to reach the one\r\nthat was in rear. Every twenty yards or so they had to stop for a rest\r\nand to take breath, and it was a welcome sight to them to see the\r\ncanvas screen go up on some oars, which denoted the fact that the cook\r\nhad started preparing a meal, and that a temporary halt, at any rate,\r\nwas going to be made. Thus the ground had to be traversed three times\r\nby the boat-hauling party. The dog-sledges all made two, and some of\r\nthem three, relays. The dogs were wonderful. Without them we could\r\nnever have transported half the food and gear that we did.\r\n\r\nWe turned in at 7 p.m. that night, and at 1 a.m. next day, the 25th,\r\nand the third day of our march, a breakfast of sledging ration was\r\nserved. By 2 a.m. we were on the march again. We wished one another a\r\nmerry Christmas, and our thoughts went back to those at home. We\r\nwondered, too, that day, as we sat down to our “lunch” of stale, thin\r\nbannock and a mug of thin cocoa, what they were having at home.\r\n\r\nAll hands were very cheerful. The prospect of a relief from the\r\nmonotony of life on the floe raised all our spirits. One man wrote in\r\nhis diary: “It’s a hard, rough, jolly life, this marching and camping;\r\nno washing of self or dishes, no undressing, no changing of clothes. We\r\nhave our food anyhow, and always impregnated with blubber-smoke;\r\nsleeping almost on the bare snow and working as hard as the human\r\nphysique is capable of doing on a minimum of food.”\r\n\r\nWe marched on, with one halt at 6 a.m., till half-past eleven. After a\r\nsupper of seal steaks and tea we turned in. The surface now was pretty\r\nbad. High temperatures during the day made the upper layers of snow\r\nvery soft, and the thin crust which formed at night was not sufficient\r\nto support a man. Consequently, at each step we went in over our knees\r\nin the soft wet snow. Sometimes a man would step into a hole in the ice\r\nwhich was hidden by the covering of snow, and be pulled up with a jerk\r\nby his harness. The sun was very hot and many were suffering from\r\ncracked lips.\r\n\r\nTwo seals were killed to-day. Wild and McIlroy, who went out to secure\r\nthem, had rather an exciting time on some very loose, rotten ice, three\r\nkiller-whales in a lead a few yards away poking up their ugly heads as\r\nif in anticipation of a feast.\r\n\r\nNext day, December 26, we started off again at 1 a.m. “The surface was\r\nmuch better than it has been for the last few days, and this is the\r\nprincipal thing that matters. The route, however, lay over very\r\nhummocky floes, and required much work with pick and shovel to make it\r\npassable for the boat-sledges. These are handled in relays by eighteen\r\nmen under Worsley. It is killing work on soft surfaces.”\r\n\r\nAt 5 a.m. we were brought up by a wide open lead after an\r\nunsatisfactorily short march. While we waited, a meal of tea and two\r\nsmall bannocks was served, but as 10 a.m. came and there were no signs\r\nof the lead closing we all turned in.\r\n\r\nIt snowed a little during the day and those who were sleeping outside\r\ngot their sleeping-bags pretty wet.\r\n\r\nAt 9.30 p.m. that night we were off again. I was, as usual, pioneering\r\nin front, followed by the cook and his mate pulling a small sledge with\r\nthe stove and all the cooking gear on. These two, black as two Mohawk\r\nMinstrels with the blubber-soot, were dubbed “Potash and Perlmutter.”\r\nNext come the dog teams, who soon overtake the cook, and the two boats\r\nbring up the rear. Were it not for these cumbrous boats we should get\r\nalong at a great rate, but we dare not abandon them on any account. As\r\nit is we left one boat, the _Stancomb Wills_, behind at Ocean Camp, and\r\nthe remaining two will barely accommodate the whole party when we leave\r\nthe floe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Potash and Perlmutter]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Loneliness”: Patience Camp]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe did a good march of one and a half miles that night before we halted\r\nfor “lunch” at 1 a.m., and then on for another mile, when at 5 a.m. we\r\ncamped by a little sloping berg.\r\n\r\nBlackie, one of Wild’s dogs, fell lame and could neither pull nor keep\r\nup with the party even when relieved of his harness, so had to be shot.\r\n\r\nNine p.m. that night, the 27th, saw us on the march again. The first\r\n200 yds. took us about five hours to cross, owing to the amount of\r\nbreaking down of pressure-ridges and filling in of leads that was\r\nrequired. The surface, too, was now very soft, so our progress was slow\r\nand tiring. We managed to get another three-quarters of a mile before\r\nlunch, and a further mile due west over a very hummocky floe before we\r\ncamped at 5.30 a.m. Greenstreet and Macklin killed and brought in a\r\nhuge Weddell seal weighing about 800 lbs., and two emperor penguins\r\nmade a welcome addition to our larder.\r\n\r\nI climbed a small tilted berg nearby. The country immediately ahead was\r\nmuch broken up. Great open leads intersected the floes at all angles,\r\nand it all looked very unpromising. Wild and I went out prospecting as\r\nusual, but it seemed too broken to travel over.\r\n\r\n“_December_ 29.—After a further reconnaissance the ice ahead proved\r\nquite un-negotiable, so at 8.30 p.m. last night, to the intense\r\ndisappointment of all, instead of forging ahead, we had to retire half\r\na mile so as to get on a stronger floe, and by 10 p.m. we had camped\r\nand all hands turned in again. The extra sleep was much needed, however\r\ndisheartening the check may be.”\r\n\r\nDuring the night a crack formed right across the floe, so we hurriedly\r\nshifted to a strong old floe about a mile and a half to the east of our\r\npresent position. The ice all around was now too broken and soft to\r\nsledge over, and yet there was not sufficient open water to allow us to\r\nlaunch the boats with any degree of safety. We had been on the march\r\nfor seven days; rations were short and the men were weak. They were\r\nworn out with the hard pulling over soft surfaces, and our stock of\r\nsledging food was very small. We had marched seven and a half miles in\r\na direct line and at this rate it would take us over three hundred days\r\nto reach the land away to the west. As we only had food for forty-two\r\ndays there was no alternative, therefore, but to camp once more on the\r\nfloe and to possess our souls with what patience we could till\r\nconditions should appear more favourable for a renewal of the attempt\r\nto escape. To this end, we stacked our surplus provisions, the reserve\r\nsledging rations being kept lashed on the sledges, and brought what\r\ngear we could from our but lately deserted Ocean Camp.\r\n\r\nOur new home, which we were to occupy for nearly three and a half\r\nmonths, we called “Patience Camp.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nPATIENCE CAMP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apathy which seemed to take possession of some of the men at the\r\nfrustration of their hopes was soon dispelled. Parties were sent out\r\ndaily in different directions to look for seals and penguins. We had\r\nleft, other than reserve sledging rations, about 110 lbs. of pemmican,\r\nincluding the dog-pemmican, and 300 lbs. of flour. In addition there\r\nwas a little tea, sugar, dried vegetables, and suet. I sent Hurley and\r\nMacklin to Ocean Camp to bring back the food that we had had to leave\r\nthere. They returned with quite a good load, including 130 lbs. of dry\r\nmilk, about 50 lbs. each of dog-pemmican and jam, and a few tins of\r\npotted meats. When they were about a mile and a half away their voices\r\nwere quite audible to us at Ocean Camp, so still was the air.\r\n\r\nWe were, of course, very short of the farinaceous element in our diet.\r\nThe flour would last ten weeks. After that our sledging rations would\r\nlast us less than three months. Our meals had to consist mainly of seal\r\nand penguin; and though this was valuable as an anti-scorbutic, so much\r\nso that not a single case of scurvy occurred amongst the party, yet it\r\nwas a badly adjusted diet, and we felt rather weak and enervated in\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\n“The cook deserves much praise for the way he has stuck to his job\r\nthrough all this severe blizzard. His galley consists of nothing but a\r\nfew boxes arranged as a table, with a canvas screen erected around them\r\non four oars and the two blubber-stoves within. The protection afforded\r\nby the screen is only partial, and the eddies drive the pungent\r\nblubber-smoke in all directions.”\r\n\r\nAfter a few days we were able to build him an igloo of ice-blocks, with\r\na tarpaulin over the top as a roof.\r\n\r\n“Our rations are just sufficient to keep us alive, but we all feel that\r\nwe could eat twice as much as we get. An average day’s food at present\r\nconsists of ½ lb. of seal with ¾ pint of tea for breakfast, a 4-oz.\r\nbannock with milk for lunch, and ¾ pint of seal stew for supper. That\r\nis barely enough, even doing very little work as we are, for of course\r\nwe are completely destitute of bread or potatoes or anything of that\r\nsort. Some seem to feel it more than others and are continually talking\r\nof food; but most of us find that the continual conversation about food\r\nonly whets an appetite that cannot be satisfied. Our craving for bread\r\nand butter is very real, not because we cannot get it, but because the\r\nsystem feels the need of it.”\r\n\r\nOwing to this shortage of food and the fact that we needed all that we\r\ncould get for ourselves, I had to order all the dogs except two teams\r\nto be shot. It was the worst job that we had had throughout the\r\nExpedition, and we felt their loss keenly.\r\n\r\nI had to be continually rearranging the weekly menu. The possible\r\nnumber of permutations of seal meat were decidedly limited. The fact\r\nthat the men did not know what was coming gave them a sort of mental\r\nspeculation, and the slightest variation was of great value.\r\n\r\n“We caught an adelie to-day (January 26) and another whale was seen at\r\nclose quarters, but no seals.\r\n\r\n“We are now very short of blubber, and in consequence one stove has to\r\nbe shut down. We only get one hot beverage a day, the tea at breakfast.\r\nFor the rest we have iced water. Sometimes we are short even of this,\r\nso we take a few chips of ice in a tobacco-tin to bed with us. In the\r\nmorning there is about a spoonful of water in the tin, and one has to\r\nlie very still all night so as not to spill it.”\r\n\r\nTo provide some variety in the food, I commenced to use the sledging\r\nration at half strength twice a week.\r\n\r\nThe ice between us and Ocean Camp, now only about five miles away and\r\nactually to the south-west of us, was very broken, but I decided to\r\nsend Macklin and Hurley back with their dogs to see if there was any\r\nmore food that could be added to our scanty stock. I gave them written\r\ninstructions to take no undue risk or cross any wide-open leads, and\r\nsaid that they were to return by midday the next day. Although they\r\nboth fell through the thin ice up to their waists more than once, they\r\nmanaged to reach the camp. They found the surface soft and sunk about\r\ntwo feet. Ocean Camp, they said, “looked like a village that had been\r\nrazed to the ground and deserted by its inhabitants.” The floor-boards\r\nforming the old tent-bottoms had prevented the sun from thawing the\r\nsnow directly underneath them, and were in consequence raised about two\r\nfeet above the level of the surrounding floe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Kitchen at Patience Camp]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Stove at Patience Camp constructed out of old\r\nOil-drums]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storehouse next the galley had taken on a list of several degrees\r\nto starboard, and pools of water had formed everywhere. They collected\r\nwhat food they could find and packed a few books in a venesta\r\nsledging-case, returning to Patience Camp by about 8 p.m. I was pleased\r\nat their quick return, and as their report seemed to show that the road\r\nwas favourable, on February 2 I sent back eighteen men under Wild to\r\nbring all the remainder of the food and the third boat, the _Stancomb\r\nWills_. They started off at 1 a.m., towing the empty boat-sledge on\r\nwhich the _James Caird_ had rested, and reached Ocean Camp about 3.30\r\na.m.\r\n\r\n“We stayed about three hours at the Camp, mounting the boat on the\r\nsledge, collecting eatables, clothing, and books. We left at 6 a.m.,\r\narriving back at Patience Camp with the boat at 12.30 p.m., taking\r\nexactly three times as long to return with the boat as it did to pull\r\nin the empty sledge to fetch it. On the return journey we had numerous\r\nhalts while the pioneer party of four were busy breaking down\r\npressure-ridges and filling in open cracks with ice-blocks, as the\r\nleads were opening up. The sun had softened the surface a good deal,\r\nand in places it was terribly hard pulling. Every one was a bit\r\nexhausted by the time we got back, as we are not now in good training\r\nand are on short rations. Every now and then the heavy sledge broke\r\nthrough the ice altogether and was practically afloat. We had an awful\r\njob to extricate it, exhausted as we were. The longest distance which\r\nwe managed to make without stopping for leads or pressure-ridges was\r\nabout three quarters of a mile.\r\n\r\n“About a mile from Patience Camp we had a welcome surprise. Sir Ernest\r\nand Hussey sledged out to meet us with dixies of hot tea, well wrapped\r\nup to keep them warm.\r\n\r\n“One or two of the men left behind had cut a moderately good track for\r\nus into the camp, and they harnessed themselves up with us, and we got\r\nin in fine style.\r\n\r\n“One excellent result of our trip was the recovery of two cases of\r\nlentils weighing 42 lbs. each.”\r\n\r\nThe next day I sent Macklin and Crean back to make a further selection\r\nof the gear, but they found that several leads had opened up during the\r\nnight, and they had to return when within a mile and a half of their\r\ndestination. We were never able to reach Ocean Camp again. Still, there\r\nwas very little left there that would have been of use to us.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of February the blubber question was a serious one. I had\r\nall the discarded seals’ heads and flippers dug up and stripped of\r\nevery vestige of blubber. Meat was very short too. We still had our\r\nthree months’ supply of sledging food practically untouched; we were\r\nonly to use this as a last resort. We had a small supply of\r\ndog-pemmican, the dogs that were left being fed on those parts of the\r\nseals that we could not use. This dog-pemmican we fried in suet with a\r\nlittle flour and made excellent bannocks.\r\n\r\nOur meat supply was now very low indeed; we were reduced to just a few\r\nscraps. Fortunately, however, we caught two seals and four emperor\r\npenguins, and next day forty adelies. We had now only forty days’ food\r\nleft, and the lack of blubber was being keenly felt. All our suet was\r\nused up, so we used seal-blubber to fry the meat in. Once we were used\r\nto its fishy taste we enjoyed it; in fact, like Oliver Twist, we wanted\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nOn Leap Year day, February 29, we held a special celebration, more to\r\ncheer the men up than for anything else. Some of the cynics of the\r\nparty held that it was to celebrate their escape from woman’s wiles for\r\nanother four years. The last of our cocoa was used to-day. Henceforth\r\nwater, with an occasional drink of weak milk, is to be our only\r\nbeverage. Three lumps of sugar were now issued to each man daily.\r\n\r\nOne night one of the dogs broke loose and played havoc with our\r\nprecious stock of bannocks. He ate four and half of a fifth before he\r\ncould be stopped. The remaining half, with the marks of the dog’s teeth\r\non it, I gave to Worsley, who divided it up amongst his seven\r\ntent-mates; they each received about half a square inch.\r\n\r\nLees, who was in charge of the food and responsible for its safe\r\nkeeping, wrote in his diary: “The shorter the provisions the more there\r\nis to do in the commissariat department, contriving to eke out our\r\nslender stores as the weeks pass by. No housewife ever had more to do\r\nthan we have in making a little go a long way.\r\n\r\n“Writing about the bannock that Peter bit makes one wish now that one\r\ncould have many a meal that one has given to the dog at home. When one\r\nis hungry, fastidiousness goes to the winds and one is only too glad to\r\neat up any scraps regardless of their antecedents. One is almost\r\nashamed to write of all the titbits one has picked up here, but it is\r\nenough to say that when the cook upset some pemmican on to an old sooty\r\ncloth and threw it outside his galley, one man subsequently made a\r\npoint of acquiring it and scraping off the palatable but dirty\r\ncompound.”\r\n\r\nAnother man searched for over an hour in the snow where he had dropped\r\na piece of cheese some days before, in the hopes of finding a few\r\ncrumbs. He was rewarded by coming across a piece as big as his\r\nthumb-nail, and considered it well worth the trouble.\r\n\r\nBy this time blubber was a regular article of our diet—either raw,\r\nboiled, or fried. “It is remarkable how our appetites have changed in\r\nthis respect. Until quite recently almost the thought of it was\r\nnauseating. Now, however, we positively demand it. The thick black oil\r\nwhich is rendered down from it, rather like train-oil in appearance and\r\ncod-liver oil in taste, we drink with avidity.”\r\n\r\nWe had now about enough farinaceous food for two meals all round, and\r\nsufficient seal to last for a month. Our forty days’ reserve sledging\r\nrations, packed on the sledges, we wished to keep till the last.\r\n\r\nBut, as one man philosophically remarked in his diary:\r\n\r\n“It will do us all good to be hungry like this, for we will appreciate\r\nso much more the good things when we get home.”\r\n\r\nSeals and penguins now seemed to studiously avoid us, and on taking\r\nstock of our provisions on March 21 I found that we had only sufficient\r\nmeat to last us for ten days, and the blubber would not last that time\r\neven, so one biscuit had to be our midday meal.\r\n\r\nOur meals were now practically all seal meat, with one biscuit at\r\nmidday; and I calculated that at this rate, allowing for a certain\r\nnumber of seals and penguins being caught, we could last for nearly six\r\nmonths. We were all very weak though, and as soon as it appeared likely\r\nthat we should leave our floe and take to the boats I should have to\r\nconsiderably increase the ration. One day a huge sea-leopard climbed on\r\nto the floe and attacked one of the men. Wild, hearing the shouting,\r\nran out and shot it. When it was cut up, we found in its stomach\r\nseveral undigested fish. These we fried in some of its blubber, and so\r\nhad our only “fresh” fish meal during the whole of our drift on the\r\nice.\r\n\r\n“As fuel is so scarce we have had to resort to melting ice for\r\ndrinking-water in tins against our bodies, and we treat the tins of\r\ndog-pemmican for breakfast similarly by keeping them in our\r\nsleeping-bags all night.\r\n\r\n“The last two teams of dogs were shot to-day (April 2) the carcasses\r\nbeing dressed for food. We had some of the dog-meat cooked, and it was\r\nnot at all bad—just like beef, but, of course, very tough.”\r\n\r\nOn April 5 we killed two seals, and this, with the sea-leopard of a few\r\ndays before, enabled us to slightly increase our ration. Everybody now\r\nfelt much happier; such is the psychological effect of hunger appeased.\r\n\r\nOn cold days a few strips of raw blubber were served out to all hands,\r\nand it is wonderful how it fortified us against the cold.\r\n\r\nOur stock of forty days’ sledging rations remained practically\r\nuntouched, but once in the boats they were used at full strength.\r\n\r\nWhen we first settled down at Patience Camp the weather was very mild.\r\nNew Year’s Eve, however, was foggy and overcast, with some snow, and\r\nnext day, though the temperature rose to 38° Fahr., it was “abominably\r\ncold and wet underfoot.” As a rule, during the first half of January\r\nthe weather was comparatively warm, so much so that we could dispense\r\nwith our mitts and work outside for quite long periods with bare hands.\r\nUp till the 13th it was exasperatingly warm and calm. This meant that\r\nour drift northwards, which was almost entirely dependent on the wind,\r\nwas checked. A light southerly breeze on the 16th raised all our hopes,\r\nand as the temperature was dropping we were looking forward to a period\r\nof favourable winds and a long drift north.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th it had developed into a howling south-westerly gale, rising\r\nnext day to a regular blizzard with much drift. No one left the shelter\r\nof his tent except to feed the dogs, fetch the meals from the galley\r\nfor his tent, or when his turn as watchman came round. For six days\r\nthis lasted, when the drift subsided somewhat, though the southerly\r\nwind continued, and we were able to get a glimpse of the sun. This\r\nshowed us to have drifted 84 miles north in six days, the longest drift\r\nwe had made. For weeks we had remained on the 67th parallel, and it\r\nseemed as though some obstruction was preventing us from passing it. By\r\nthis amazing leap, however, we had crossed the Antarctic Circle, and\r\nwere now 146 miles from the nearest land to the west of us—Snow\r\nHill—and 357 miles from the South Orkneys, the first land directly to\r\nthe north of us.\r\n\r\nAs if to make up for this, an equally strong north-easterly wind sprang\r\nup next day, and not only stopped our northward drift but set us back\r\nthree miles to the south. As usual, high temperatures and wet fog\r\naccompanied these northerly winds, though the fog disappeared on the\r\nafternoon of January 25, and we had the unusual spectacle of bright hot\r\nsun with a north-easterly wind. It was as hot a day as we had ever had.\r\nThe temperature was 36° Fahr. in the shade and nearly 80° Fahr. inside\r\nthe tents. This had an awful effect on the surface, covering it with\r\npools and making it very treacherous to walk upon. Ten days of\r\nnortherly winds rather damped our spirits, but a strong southerly wind\r\non February 4, backing later, to south-east, carried us north again.\r\nHigh temperatures and northerly winds soon succeeded this, so that our\r\naverage rate of northerly drift was about a mile a day in February.\r\nThroughout the month the diaries record alternately “a wet day,\r\novercast and mild,” and “bright and cold with light southerly winds.”\r\nThe wind was now the vital factor with us and the one topic of any real\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of March brought cold, damp, calm weather, with much wet\r\nsnow and overcast skies. The effect of the weather on our mental state\r\nwas very marked. All hands felt much more cheerful on a bright sunny\r\nday, and looked forward with much more hope to the future, than when it\r\nwas dull and overcast. This had a much greater effect than an increase\r\nin rations.\r\n\r\nA south-easterly gale on the 13th lasting for five days sent us twenty\r\nmiles north, and from now our good fortune, as far as the wind was\r\nconcerned, never left us for any length of time. On the 20th we\r\nexperienced the worst blizzard we had had up to that time, though worse\r\nwere to come after landing on Elephant Island. Thick snow fell, making\r\nit impossible to see the camp from thirty yards off. To go outside for\r\na moment entailed getting covered all over with fine powdery snow,\r\nwhich required a great deal of brushing off before one could enter\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAs the blizzard eased up, the temperature dropped and it became\r\nbitterly cold. In our weak condition, with torn, greasy clothes, we\r\nfelt these sudden variations in temperature much more than we otherwise\r\nwould have done. A calm, clear, magnificently warm day followed, and\r\nnext day came a strong southerly blizzard. Drifts four feet deep\r\ncovered everything, and we had to be continually digging up our scanty\r\nstock of meat to prevent its being lost altogether. We had taken\r\nadvantage of the previous fine day to attempt to thaw out our blankets,\r\nwhich were frozen stiff and could be held out like pieces of\r\nsheet-iron; but on this day, and for the next two or three also, it was\r\nimpossible to do anything but get right inside one’s frozen\r\nsleeping-bag to try and get warm. Too cold to read or sew, we had to\r\nkeep our hands well inside, and pass the time in conversation with each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Worsley taking Observations of the Sun to determine\r\nour Position]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “We cut Steps in this Twenty-five Foot Slab and it\r\nmakes a fine Look-out”]\r\n\r\n\r\n“The temperature was not strikingly low as temperatures go down here,\r\nbut the terrific winds penetrate the flimsy fabric of our fragile tents\r\nand create so much draught that it is impossible to keep warm within.\r\nAt supper last night our drinking-water froze over in the tin in the\r\ntent before we could drink it. It is curious how thirsty we all are.”\r\n\r\nTwo days of brilliant warm sunshine succeeded these cold times, and on\r\nMarch 29 we experienced, to us, the most amazing weather. It began to\r\nrain hard, and it was the first rain that we had seen since we left\r\nSouth Georgia sixteen months ago. We regarded, it as our first touch\r\nwith civilization, and many of the men longed for the rain and fogs of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nStrong south winds with dull, overcast skies and occasional high\r\ntemperatures were now our lot till April 7, when the mist lifted and we\r\ncould make out what appeared to be land to the north.\r\n\r\nAlthough the general drift of our ice-floe had indicated to us that we\r\nmust eventually drift north, our progress in that direction was not by\r\nany means uninterrupted. We were at the mercy of the wind, and could no\r\nmore control our drift than we could control the weather.\r\n\r\nA long spell of calm, still weather at the beginning of January caused\r\nus some anxiety by keeping us at about the latitude that we were in at\r\nthe beginning of December. Towards the end of January, however, a long\r\ndrift of eighty-four miles in a blizzard cheered us all up. This soon\r\nstopped and we began a slight drift to the east. Our general drift now\r\nslowed up considerably, and by February 22 we were still eighty miles\r\nfrom Paulet Island, which now was our objective. There was a hut there\r\nand some stores which had been taken down by the ship which went to the\r\nrescue of Nordenskjold’s Expedition in 1904, and whose fitting out and\r\nequipment I had charge of. We remarked amongst ourselves what a strange\r\nturn of fate it would be if the very cases of provisions which I had\r\nordered and sent out so many years before were now to support us during\r\nthe coming winter. But this was not to be. March 5 found us about forty\r\nmiles south of the longitude of Paulet Island, but well to the east of\r\nit; and as the ice was still too much broken up to sledge over, it\r\nappeared as if we should be carried past it. By March 17 we were\r\nexactly on a level with Paulet Island but sixty miles to the east. It\r\nmight have been six hundred for all the chance that we had of reaching\r\nit by sledging across the broken sea-ice in its present condition.\r\n\r\nOur thoughts now turned to the Danger Islands, thirty-five miles away.\r\n“It seems that we are likely to drift up and down this coast from\r\nsouth-west to north-east and back again for some time yet before we\r\nfinally clear the point of Joinville Island; until we do we cannot hope\r\nfor much opening up, as the ice must be very congested against the\r\nsouth-east coast of the island, otherwise our failure to respond to the\r\nrecent south-easterly gale cannot be well accounted for. In support of\r\nthis there has been some very heavy pressure on the north-east side, of\r\nour floe, one immense block being up-ended to a height of 25 ft. We saw\r\na Dominican gull fly over to-day, the first we have seen since leaving\r\nSouth Georgia; it is another sign of our proximity to land. We cut\r\nsteps in this 25-ft. slab, and it makes a fine look-out. When the\r\nweather clears we confidently expect to see land.”\r\n\r\nA heavy blizzard obscured our view till March 23. “‘Land in sight’ was\r\nreported this morning. We were sceptical, but this afternoon it showed\r\nup unmistakably to the west, and there can be no further doubt about\r\nit. It is Joinville Island, and its serrated mountain ranges, all\r\nsnow-clad, are just visible on the horizon. This barren,\r\ninhospitable-looking land would be a haven of refuge to us if we could\r\nbut reach it. It would be ridiculous to make the attempt though, with\r\nthe ice all broken up as it is. It is too loose and broken to march\r\nover, yet not open enough to be able to launch the boats.” For the next\r\ntwo or three days we saw ourselves slowly drifting past the land,\r\nlonging to reach it yet prevented from doing so by the ice between, and\r\ntowards the end of March we saw Mount Haddington fade away into the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nOur hopes were now centred on Elephant Island or Clarence Island, which\r\nlay 100 miles almost due north of us.\r\n\r\nIf we failed to reach either of them we might try for South Georgia,\r\nbut our chances of reaching it would be very small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nESCAPE FROM THE ICE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 7 at daylight the long-desired peak of Clarence Island came\r\ninto view, bearing nearly north from our camp. At first it had the\r\nappearance of a huge berg, but with the growing light we could see\r\nplainly the black lines of scree and the high, precipitous cliffs of\r\nthe island, which were miraged up to some extent. The dark rocks in the\r\nwhite snow were a pleasant sight. So long had our eyes looked on\r\nicebergs that apparently grew or dwindled according to the angles at\r\nwhich the shadows were cast by the sun; so often had we discovered\r\nrocky islands and brought in sight the peaks of Joinville Land, only to\r\nfind them, after some change of wind or temperature, floating away as\r\nnebulous cloud or ordinary berg; that not until Worsley, Wild, and\r\nHurley had unanimously confirmed my observation was I satisfied that I\r\nwas really looking at Clarence Island. The land was still more than\r\nsixty miles away, but it had to our eyes something of the appearance of\r\nhome, since we expected to find there our first solid footing after all\r\nthe long months of drifting on the unstable ice. We had adjusted\r\nourselves to the life on the floe, but our hopes had been fixed all the\r\ntime on some possible landing-place. As one hope failed to materialize,\r\nour anticipations fed themselves on another. Our drifting home had no\r\nrudder to guide it, no sail to give it speed. We were dependent upon\r\nthe caprice of wind and current; we went whither those irresponsible\r\nforces listed. The longing to feel solid earth under our feet filled\r\nour hearts.\r\n\r\nIn the full daylight Clarence Island ceased to look like land and had\r\nthe appearance of a berg of more than eight or ten miles away, so\r\ndeceptive are distances in the clear air of the Antarctic. The sharp\r\nwhite peaks of Elephant Island showed to the west of north a little\r\nlater in the day.\r\n\r\n“I have stopped issuing sugar now, and our meals consist of seal meat\r\nand blubber only, with 7 ozs. of dried milk per day for the party,” I\r\nwrote. “Each man receives a pinch of salt, and the milk is boiled up to\r\nmake hot drinks for all hands. The diet suits us, since we cannot get\r\nmuch exercise on the floe and the blubber supplies heat. Fried slices\r\nof blubber seem to our taste to resemble crisp bacon. It certainly is\r\nno hardship to eat it, though persons living under civilized conditions\r\nprobably would shudder at it. The hardship would come if we were unable\r\nto get it.”\r\n\r\nI think that the palate of the human animal can adjust itself to\r\nanything. Some creatures will die before accepting a strange diet if\r\ndeprived of their natural food. The Yaks of the Himalayan uplands must\r\nfeed from the growing grass, scanty and dry though it may be, and would\r\nstarve even if allowed the best oats and corn.\r\n\r\n“We still have the dark water-sky of the last week with us to the\r\nsouth-west and west, round to the north-east. We are leaving all the\r\nbergs to the west and there are few within our range of vision now. The\r\nswell is more marked to-day, and I feel sure we are at the verge of the\r\nfloe-ice. One strong gale, followed by a calm would scatter the pack, I\r\nthink, and then we could push through. I have been thinking much of our\r\nprospects. The appearance of Clarence Island after our long drift\r\nseems, somehow, to convey an ultimatum. The island is the last outpost\r\nof the south and our final chance of a landing-place. Beyond it lies\r\nthe broad Atlantic. Our little boats may be compelled any day now to\r\nsail unsheltered over the open sea with a thousand leagues of ocean\r\nseparating them from the land to the north and east. It seems vital\r\nthat we shall land on Clarence Island or its neighbour, Elephant\r\nIsland. The latter island has attraction for us, although as far as I\r\nknow nobody has ever landed there. Its name suggests the presence of\r\nthe plump and succulent sea-elephant. We have an increasing desire in\r\nany case to get firm ground under our feet. The floe has been a good\r\nfriend to us, but it is reaching the end of its journey, and it is\r\nliable at any time now to break up and fling us into the unplumbed\r\nsea.”\r\n\r\nA little later, after reviewing the whole situation in the light of our\r\ncircumstances, I made up my mind that we should try to reach Deception\r\nIsland. The relative positions of Clarence, Elephant, and Deception\r\nIslands can be seen on the chart. The two islands first named lay\r\ncomparatively near to us and were separated by some eighty miles of\r\nwater from Prince George Island, which was about 150 miles away from\r\nour camp on the berg. From this island a chain of similar islands\r\nextends westward, terminating in Deception Island. The channels\r\nseparating these desolate patches of rock and ice are from ten to\r\nfifteen miles wide. But we knew from the Admiralty sailing directions\r\nthat there were stores for the use of shipwrecked mariners on Deception\r\nIsland, and it was possible that the summer whalers had not yet\r\ndeserted its harbour. Also we had learned from our scanty records that\r\na small church had been erected there for the benefit of the transient\r\nwhalers. The existence of this building would mean to us a supply of\r\ntimber, from which, if dire necessity urged us, we could construct a\r\nreasonably seaworthy boat. We had discussed this point during our drift\r\non the floe. Two of our boats were fairly strong, but the third, the\r\n_James Caird_, was light, although a little longer than the others. All\r\nof them were small for the navigation of these notoriously stormy seas,\r\nand they would be heavily loaded, so a voyage in open water would be a\r\nserious undertaking. I fear that the carpenter’s fingers were already\r\nitching to convert pews into topsides and decks. In any case, the worst\r\nthat could befall us when we had reached Deception Island would be a\r\nwait until the whalers returned about the middle of November.\r\n\r\nAnother bit of information gathered from the records of the west side\r\nof the Weddell Sea related to Prince George Island. The Admiralty\r\n“Sailing Directions,” referring to the South Shetlands, mentioned a\r\ncave on this island. None of us had seen that cave or could say if it\r\nwas large or small, wet or dry; but as we drifted on our floe and\r\nlater, when navigating the treacherous leads and making our uneasy\r\nnight camps, that cave seemed to my fancy to be a palace which in\r\ncontrast would dim the splendours of Versailles.\r\n\r\nThe swell increased that night and the movement of the ice became more\r\npronounced. Occasionally a neighbouring floe would hammer against the\r\nice on which we were camped, and the lesson of these blows was plain to\r\nread. We must get solid ground under our feet quickly. When the\r\nvibration ceased after a heavy surge, my thoughts flew round to the\r\nproblem ahead. If the party had not numbered more than six men a\r\nsolution would not have been so hard to find; but obviously the\r\ntransportation of the whole party to a place of safety, with the\r\nlimited means at our disposal, was going to be a matter of extreme\r\ndifficulty. There were twenty-eight men on our floating cake of ice,\r\nwhich was steadily dwindling under the influence of wind, weather,\r\ncharging floes, and heavy swell. I confess that I felt the burden of\r\nresponsibility sit heavily on my shoulders; but, on the other hand, I\r\nwas stimulated and cheered by the attitude of the men. Loneliness is\r\nthe penalty of leadership, but the man who has to make the decisions is\r\nassisted greatly if he feels that there is no uncertainty in the minds\r\nof those who follow him, and that his orders will be carried out\r\nconfidently and in expectation of success.\r\n\r\nThe sun was shining in the blue sky on the following morning (April 8).\r\nClarence Island showed clearly on the horizon, and Elephant Island\r\ncould also be distinguished. The single snow-clad peak of Clarence\r\nIsland stood up as a beacon of safety, though the most optimistic\r\nimagination could not make an easy path of the ice and ocean that\r\nseparated us from that giant, white and austere.\r\n\r\n“The pack was much looser this morning, and the long rolling swell from\r\nthe north-east is more pronounced than it was yesterday. The floes rise\r\nand fall with the surge of the sea. We evidently are drifting with the\r\nsurface current, for all the heavier masses of floe, bergs, and\r\nhummocks are being left behind. There has been some discussion in the\r\ncamp as to the advisability of making one of the bergs our home for the\r\ntime being and drifting with it to the west. The idea is not sound. I\r\ncannot be sure that the berg would drift in the right direction. If it\r\ndid move west and carried us into the open water, what would be our\r\nfate when we tried to launch the boats down the steep sides of the berg\r\nin the sea-swell after the surrounding floes had left us? One must\r\nreckon, too, the chance of the berg splitting or even overturning\r\nduring our stay. It is not possible to gauge the condition of a big\r\nmass of ice by surface appearance. The ice may have a fault, and when\r\nthe wind, current, and swell set up strains and tensions, the line of\r\nweakness may reveal itself suddenly and disastrously. No, I do not like\r\nthe idea of drifting on a berg. We must stay on our floe till\r\nconditions improve and then make another attempt to advance towards the\r\nland.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “There was no Sleep for us that Night, so we lit the\r\nBlubber Stove”]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hauling up the Boats for the Night]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 6.30 p.m. a particularly heavy shock went through our floe. The\r\nwatchman and other members of the party made an immediate inspection\r\nand found a crack right under the _James Caird_ and between the other\r\ntwo boats and the main camp. Within five minutes the boats were over\r\nthe crack and close to the tents. The trouble was not caused by a blow\r\nfrom another floe. We could see that the piece of ice we occupied had\r\nslewed and now presented its long axis towards the oncoming swell. The\r\nfloe, therefore, was pitching in the manner of a ship, and it had\r\ncracked across when the swell lifted the centre, leaving the two ends\r\ncomparatively unsupported. We were now on a triangular raft of ice, the\r\nthree sides measuring, roughly, 90, 100, and 120 yds. Night came down\r\ndull and overcast, and before midnight the wind had freshened from the\r\nwest. We could see that the pack was opening under the influence of\r\nwind, wave, and current, and I felt that the time for launching the\r\nboats was near at hand. Indeed, it was obvious that even if the\r\nconditions were unfavourable for a start during the coming day, we\r\ncould not safely stay on the floe many hours longer. The movement of\r\nthe ice in the swell was increasing, and the floe might split right\r\nunder our camp. We had made preparations for quick action if anything\r\nof the kind occurred. Our case would be desperate if the ice broke into\r\nsmall pieces not large enough to support our party and not loose enough\r\nto permit the use of the boats.\r\n\r\nThe following day was Sunday (April 9), but it proved no day of rest\r\nfor us. Many of the important events of our Expedition occurred on\r\nSundays, and this particular day was to see our forced departure from\r\nthe floe on which we had lived for nearly six months, and the start of\r\nour journeyings in the boats.\r\n\r\n“This has been an eventful day. The morning was fine, though somewhat\r\novercast by stratus and cumulus clouds; moderate south-south-westerly\r\nand south-easterly breezes. We hoped that with this wind the ice would\r\ndrift nearer to Clarence Island. At 7 a.m. lanes of water and leads\r\ncould be seen on the horizon to the west. The ice separating us from\r\nthe lanes was loose, but did not appear to be workable for the boats.\r\nThe long swell from the north-west was coming in more freely than on\r\nthe previous day and was driving the floes together in the utmost\r\nconfusion. The loose brash between the masses of ice was being churned\r\nto mudlike consistency, and no boat could have lived in the channels\r\nthat opened and closed around us. Our own floe was suffering in the\r\ngeneral disturbance, and after breakfast I ordered the tents to be\r\nstruck and everything prepared for an immediate start when the boats\r\ncould be launched.”\r\n\r\nI had decided to take the _James Caird_ myself, with Wild and eleven\r\nmen. This was the largest of our boats, and in addition to her human\r\ncomplement she carried the major portion of the stores. Worsley had\r\ncharge of the _Dudley Docker_ with nine men, and Hudson and Crean were\r\nthe senior men on the _Stancomb Wills_.\r\n\r\nSoon after breakfast the ice closed again. We were standing by, with\r\nour preparations as complete as they could be made, when at 11 a.m. our\r\nfloe suddenly split right across under the boats. We rushed our gear on\r\nto the larger of the two pieces and watched with strained attention for\r\nthe next development. The crack had cut through the site of my tent. I\r\nstood on the edge of the new fracture, and, looking across the widening\r\nchannel of water, could see the spot where for many months my head and\r\nshoulders had rested when I was in my sleeping-bag. The depression\r\nformed by my body and legs was on our side of the crack. The ice had\r\nsunk under my weight during the months of waiting in the tent, and I\r\nhad many times put snow under the bag to fill the hollow. The lines of\r\nstratification showed clearly the different layers of snow. How fragile\r\nand precarious had been our resting-place! Yet usage had dulled our\r\nsense of danger. The floe had become our home, and during the early\r\nmonths of the drift we had almost ceased to realize that it was but a\r\nsheet of ice floating on unfathomed seas. Now our home was being\r\nshattered under our feet, and we had a sense of loss and incompleteness\r\nhard to describe.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of our floe came together again a little later, and we\r\nhad our lunch of seal meat, all hands eating their fill. I thought that\r\na good meal would be the best possible preparation for the journey that\r\nnow seemed imminent, and as we would not be able to take all our meat\r\nwith us when we finally moved, we could regard every pound eaten as a\r\npound rescued. The call to action came at 1 p.m. The pack opened well\r\nand the channels became navigable. The conditions were not all one\r\ncould have desired, but it was best not to wait any longer. The _Dudley\r\nDocker_ and the _Stancomb Wills_ were launched quickly. Stores were\r\nthrown in, and the two boats were pulled clear of the immediate floes\r\ntowards a pool of open water three miles broad, in which floated a lone\r\nand mighty berg. The _James Caird_ was the last boat to leave, heavily\r\nloaded with stores and odds and ends of camp equipment. Many things\r\nregarded by us as essentials at that time were to be discarded a little\r\nlater as the pressure of the primitive became more severe. Man can\r\nsustain life with very scanty means. The trappings of civilization are\r\nsoon cast aside in the face of stern realities, and given the barest\r\nopportunity of winning food and shelter, man can live and even find his\r\nlaughter ringing true.\r\n\r\nThe three boats were a mile away from our floe home at 2 p.m. We had\r\nmade our way through the channels and had entered the big pool when we\r\nsaw a rush of foam-clad water and tossing ice approaching us, like the\r\ntidal bore of a river. The pack was being impelled to the east by a\r\ntide-rip, and two huge masses of ice were driving down upon us on\r\nconverging courses. The _James Caird_ was leading. Starboarding the\r\nhelm and bending strongly to the oars, we managed to get clear. The two\r\nother boats followed us, though from their position astern at first\r\nthey had not realized the immediate danger. The _Stancomb Wills_ was\r\nthe last boat and she was very nearly caught, but by great exertion she\r\nwas kept just ahead of the driving ice. It was an unusual and startling\r\nexperience. The effect of tidal action on ice is not often as marked as\r\nit was that day. The advancing ice, accompanied by a large wave,\r\nappeared to be travelling at about three knots; and if we had not\r\nsucceeded in pulling clear we would certainly have been swamped.\r\n\r\nWe pulled hard for an hour to windward of the berg that lay in the open\r\nwater. The swell was crashing on its perpendicular sides and throwing\r\nspray to a height of sixty feet. Evidently there was an ice-foot at the\r\neast end, for the swell broke before it reached the berg-face and flung\r\nits white spray on to the blue ice-wall. We might have paused to have\r\nadmired the spectacle under other conditions; but night was coming on\r\napace, and we needed a camping-place. As we steered north-west, still\r\namid the ice-floes, the _Dudley Docker_ got jammed between two masses\r\nwhile attempting to make a short cut. The old adage about a short cut\r\nbeing the longest way round is often as true in the Antarctic as it is\r\nin the peaceful countryside. The _James Caird_ got a line aboard the\r\n_Dudley Docker_, and after some hauling the boat was brought clear of\r\nthe ice again. We hastened forward in the twilight in search of a flat,\r\nold floe, and presently found a fairly large piece rocking in the\r\nswell. It was not an ideal camping-place by any means, but darkness had\r\novertaken us. We hauled the boats up, and by 8 p.m. had the tents\r\npitched and the blubber-stove burning cheerily. Soon all hands were\r\nwell fed and happy in their tents, and snatches of song came to me as I\r\nwrote up my log.\r\n\r\nSome intangible feeling of uneasiness made me leave my tent about 11\r\np.m. that night and glance around the quiet camp. The stars between the\r\nsnow-flurries showed that the floe had swung round and was end on to\r\nthe swell, a position exposing it to sudden strains. I started to walk\r\nacross the floe in order to warn the watchman to look carefully for\r\ncracks, and as I was passing the men’s tent the floe lifted on the\r\ncrest of a swell and cracked right under my feet. The men were in one\r\nof the dome-shaped tents, and it began to stretch apart as the ice\r\nopened. A muffled sound, suggestive of suffocation, came from beneath\r\nthe stretching tent. I rushed forward, helped some emerging men from\r\nunder the canvas, and called out, “Are you all right?”\r\n\r\n“There are two in the water,” somebody answered. The crack had widened\r\nto about four feet, and as I threw myself down at the edge, I saw a\r\nwhitish object floating in the water. It was a sleeping-bag with a man\r\ninside. I was able to grasp it, and with a heave lifted man and bag on\r\nto the floe. A few seconds later the ice-edges came together again with\r\ntremendous force. Fortunately, there had been but one man in the water,\r\nor the incident might have been a tragedy. The rescued bag contained\r\nHolness, who was wet down to the waist but otherwise unscathed. The\r\ncrack was now opening again. The _James Caird_ and my tent were on one\r\nside of the opening and the remaining two boats and the rest of the\r\ncamp on the other side. With two or three men to help me I struck my\r\ntent; then all hands manned the painter and rushed the _James Caird_\r\nacross the opening crack. We held to the rope while, one by one, the\r\nmen left on our side of the floe jumped the channel or scrambled over\r\nby means of the boat. Finally I was left alone. The night had swallowed\r\nall the others and the rapid movement of the ice forced me to let go\r\nthe painter. For a moment I felt that my piece of rocking floe was the\r\nloneliest place in the world. Peering into the darkness; I could just\r\nsee the dark figures on the other floe. I hailed Wild, ordering him to\r\nlaunch the _Stancomb Wills_, but I need not have troubled. His quick\r\nbrain had anticipated the order and already the boat was being manned\r\nand hauled to the ice-edge. Two or three minutes later she reached me,\r\nand I was ferried across to the Camp.\r\n\r\nWe were now on a piece of flat ice about 200 ft. long and 100 ft. wide.\r\nThere was no more sleep for any of us that night. The killers were\r\nblowing in the lanes around, and we waited for daylight and watched for\r\nsigns of another crack in the ice. The hours passed with laggard feet\r\nas we stood huddled together or walked to and fro in the effort to keep\r\nsome warmth in our bodies. We lit the blubber-stove at 3 a.m., and with\r\npipes going and a cup of hot milk for each man, we were able to\r\ndiscover some bright spots in our outlook. At any rate, we were on the\r\nmove at last, and if dangers and difficulties lay ahead we could meet\r\nand overcome them. No longer were we drifting helplessly at the mercy\r\nof wind and current.\r\n\r\nThe first glimmerings of dawn came at 6 a.m., and I waited anxiously\r\nfor the full daylight. The swell was growing, and at times our ice was\r\nsurrounded closely by similar pieces. At 6.30 a.m. we had hot hoosh,\r\nand then stood by waiting for the pack to open. Our chance came at 8,\r\nwhen we launched the boats, loaded them, and started to make our way\r\nthrough the lanes in a northerly direction. The _James Caird_ was in\r\nthe lead, with the _Stancomb Wills_ next and the _Dudley Docker_\r\nbringing up the rear. In order to make the boats more seaworthy we had\r\nleft some of our shovels, picks, and dried vegetables on the floe, and\r\nfor a long time we could see the abandoned stores forming a dark spot\r\non the ice. The boats were still heavily loaded. We got out of the\r\nlanes, and entered a stretch of open water at 11 a.m. A strong easterly\r\nbreeze was blowing, but the fringe of pack lying outside protected us\r\nfrom the full force of the swell, just as the coral-reef of a tropical\r\nisland checks the rollers of the Pacific. Our way was across the open\r\nsea, and soon after noon we swung round the north end of the pack and\r\nlaid a course to the westward, the _James Caird_ still in the lead.\r\nImmediately our deeply laden boats began to make heavy weather. They\r\nshipped sprays, which, freezing as they fell, covered men and gear with\r\nice, and soon it was clear that we could not safely proceed. I put the\r\n_James Caird_ round and ran for the shelter of the pack again, the\r\nother boats following. Back inside the outer line of ice the sea was\r\nnot breaking. This was at 3 p.m., and all hands were tired and cold. A\r\nbig floeberg resting peacefully ahead caught my eye, and half an hour\r\nlater we had hauled up the boats and pitched camp for the night. It was\r\na fine, big, blue berg with an attractively solid appearance, and from\r\nour camp we could get a good view of the surrounding sea and ice. The\r\nhighest point was about 15 ft. above sea-level. After a hot meal all\r\nhands, except the watchman, turned in. Every one was in need of rest\r\nafter the troubles of the previous night and the unaccustomed strain of\r\nthe last thirty-six hours at the oars. The berg appeared well able to\r\nwithstand the battering of the sea, and too deep and massive to be\r\nseriously affected by the swell; but it was not as safe as it looked.\r\nAbout midnight the watchman called me and showed me that the heavy\r\nnorth-westerly swell was undermining the ice. A great piece had broken\r\noff within eight feet of my tent. We made what inspection was possible\r\nin the darkness, and found that on the westward side of the berg the\r\nthick snow covering was yielding rapidly to the attacks of the sea. An\r\nice-foot had formed just under the surface of the water. I decided that\r\nthere was no immediate danger and did not call the men. The\r\nnorth-westerly wind strengthened during the night.\r\n\r\nThe morning of April 11 was overcast and misty. There was a haze on the\r\nhorizon, and daylight showed that the pack had closed round our berg,\r\nmaking it impossible in the heavy swell to launch the boats. We could\r\nsee no sign of the water. Numerous whales and killers were blowing\r\nbetween the floes, and Cape pigeons, petrels, and fulmars were circling\r\nround our berg. The scene from our camp as the daylight brightened was\r\nmagnificent beyond description, though I must admit that we viewed it\r\nwith anxiety. Heaving hills of pack and floe were sweeping towards us\r\nin long undulations, later to be broken here and there by the dark\r\nlines that indicated open water. As each swell lifted around our\r\nrapidly dissolving berg it drove floe-ice on to the ice-foot, shearing\r\noff more of the top snow-covering and reducing the size of our camp.\r\nWhen the floes retreated to attack again the water swirled over the\r\nice-foot, which was rapidly increasing in width. The launching of the\r\nboats under such conditions would be difficult. Time after time, so\r\noften that a track was formed, Worsley, Wild, and I, climbed to the\r\nhighest point of the berg and stared out to the horizon in search of a\r\nbreak in the pack. After long hours had dragged past, far away on the\r\nlift of the swell there appeared a dark break in the tossing field of\r\nice. Æons seemed to pass, so slowly it approached. I noticed enviously\r\nthe calm peaceful attitudes of two seals which lolled lazily on a\r\nrocking floe. They were at home and had no reason for worry or cause\r\nfor fear. If they thought at all, I suppose they counted it an ideal\r\nday for a joyous journey on the tumbling ice. To us it was a day that\r\nseemed likely to lead to no more days. I do not think I had ever before\r\nfelt the anxiety that belongs to leadership quite so keenly. When I\r\nlooked down at the camp to rest my eyes from the strain of watching the\r\nwide white expanse broken by that one black ribbon of open water, I\r\ncould see that my companions were waiting with more than ordinary\r\ninterest to learn what I thought about it all. After one particularly\r\nheavy collision somebody shouted sharply, “She has cracked in the\r\nmiddle.” I jumped off the look-out station and ran to the place the men\r\nwere examining. There was a crack, but investigation showed it to be a\r\nmere surface break in the snow with no indication of a split in the\r\nberg itself. The carpenter mentioned calmly that earlier in the day he\r\nhad actually gone adrift on a fragment of ice. He was standing near the\r\nedge of our camping-ground when the ice under his feet parted from the\r\nparent mass. A quick jump over the widening gap saved him.\r\n\r\nThe hours dragged on. One of the anxieties in my mind was the\r\npossibility that we would be driven by the current through the\r\neighty-mile gap between Clarence Island and Prince George Island into\r\nthe open Atlantic; but slowly the open water came nearer, and at noon\r\nit had almost reached us. A long lane, narrow but navigable, stretched\r\nout to the south-west horizon. Our chance came a little later. We\r\nrushed our boats over the edge of the reeling berg and swung them clear\r\nof the ice-foot as it rose beneath them. The _James Caird_ was nearly\r\ncapsized by a blow from below as the berg rolled away, but she got into\r\ndeep water. We flung stores and gear aboard and within a few minutes\r\nwere away. The _James Caird_ and _Dudley Docker_ had good sails and\r\nwith a favourable breeze could make progress along the lane, with the\r\nrolling fields of ice on either side. The swell was heavy and spray was\r\nbreaking over the ice-floes. An attempt to set a little rag of sail on\r\nthe _Stancomb Wills_ resulted in serious delay. The area of sail was\r\ntoo small to be of much assistance, and while the men were engaged in\r\nthis work the boat drifted down towards the ice-floe, where her\r\nposition was likely to be perilous. Seeing her plight, I sent the\r\n_Dudley Docker_ back for her and tied the _James Caird_ up to a piece\r\nof ice. The _Dudley Docker_ had to tow the _Stancomb Wills_, and the\r\ndelay cost us two hours of valuable daylight. When I had the three\r\nboats together again we continued down the lane, and soon saw a wider\r\nstretch of water to the west; it appeared to offer us release from the\r\ngrip of the pack. At the head of an ice-tongue that nearly closed the\r\ngap through which we might enter the open space was a wave-worn berg\r\nshaped like some curious antediluvian monster, an icy Cerberus guarding\r\nthe way. It had head and eyes and rolled so heavily that it almost\r\noverturned. Its sides dipped deep in the sea, and as it rose again the\r\nwater seemed to be streaming from its eyes, as though it were weeping\r\nat our escape from the clutch of the floes. This may seem fanciful to\r\nthe reader, but the impression was real to us at the time. People\r\nliving under civilized conditions, surrounded by Nature’s varied forms\r\nof life and by all the familiar work of their own hands, may scarcely\r\nrealize how quickly the mind, influenced by the eyes, responds to the\r\nunusual and weaves about it curious imaginings like the firelight\r\nfancies of our childhood days. We had lived long amid the ice, and we\r\nhalf-unconsciously strove to see resemblances to human faces and living\r\nforms in the fantastic contours and massively uncouth shapes of berg\r\nand floe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Reeling Berg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sailing South Again]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt dusk we made fast to a heavy floe, each boat having its painter\r\nfastened to a separate hummock in order to avoid collisions in the\r\nswell. We landed the blubber-stove, boiled some water in order to\r\nprovide hot milk, and served cold rations. I also landed the dome tents\r\nand stripped the coverings from the hoops. Our experience of the\r\nprevious day in the open sea had shown us that the tents must be packed\r\ntightly. The spray had dashed over the bows and turned to ice on the\r\ncloth, which had soon grown dangerously heavy. Other articles off our\r\nscanty equipment had to go that night. We were carrying only the things\r\nthat had seemed essential, but we stripped now to the barest limit of\r\nsafety. We had hoped for a quiet night, but presently we were forced to\r\ncast off, since pieces of loose ice began to work round the floe.\r\nDrift-ice is always attracted to the lee side of a heavy floe, where it\r\nbumps and presses under the influence of the current. I had determined\r\nnot to risk a repetition of the last night’s experience and so had not\r\npulled the boats up. We spent the hours of darkness keeping an offing\r\nfrom the main line of pack under the lee of the smaller pieces.\r\nConstant rain and snow squalls blotted out the stars and soaked us\r\nthrough, and at times it was only by shouting to each other that we\r\nmanaged to keep the boats together. There was no sleep for anybody\r\nowing to the severe cold, and we dare not pull fast enough to keep\r\nourselves warm since we were unable to see more than a few yards ahead.\r\nOccasionally the ghostly shadows of silver, snow, and fulmar petrels\r\nflashed close to us, and all around we could hear the killers blowing,\r\ntheir short, sharp hisses sounding like sudden escapes of steam. The\r\nkillers were a source of anxiety, for a boat could easily have been\r\ncapsized by one of them coming up to blow. They would throw aside in a\r\nnonchalant fashion pieces of ice much bigger than our boats when they\r\nrose to the surface, and we had an uneasy feeling that the white\r\nbottoms of the boats would look like ice from below. Shipwrecked\r\nmariners drifting in the Antarctic seas would be things not dreamed of\r\nin the killers’ philosophy, and might appear on closer examination to\r\nbe tasty substitutes for seal and penguin. We certainly regarded the\r\nkillers with misgivings.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of April 12 the weather improved and the wind\r\ndropped. Dawn came with a clear sky, cold and fearless. I looked around\r\nat the faces of my companions in the _James Caird_ and saw pinched and\r\ndrawn features. The strain was beginning to tell. Wild sat at the\r\nrudder with the same calm, confident expression that he would have worn\r\nunder happier conditions; his steel-blue eyes looked out to the day\r\nahead. All the people, though evidently suffering, were doing their\r\nbest to be cheerful, and the prospect of a hot breakfast was\r\ninspiriting. I told all the boats that immediately we could find a\r\nsuitable floe the cooker would be started and hot milk and Bovril would\r\nsoon fix everybody up. Away we rowed to the westward through open pack,\r\nfloes of all shapes and sizes on every side of us, and every man not\r\nengaged in pulling looking eagerly for a suitable camping-place. I\r\ncould gauge the desire for food of the different members by the\r\neagerness they displayed in pointing out to me the floes they\r\nconsidered exactly suited to our purpose. The temperature was about 10°\r\nFahr., and the Burberry suits of the rowers crackled as the men bent to\r\nthe oars. I noticed little fragments of ice and frost falling from arms\r\nand bodies. At eight o’clock a decent floe appeared ahead and we pulled\r\nup to it. The galley was landed, and soon the welcome steam rose from\r\nthe cooking food as the blubber-stove flared and smoked. Never did a\r\ncook work under more anxious scrutiny. Worsley, Crean, and I stayed in\r\nour respective boats to keep them steady and prevent collisions with\r\nthe floe, since the swell was still running strong, but the other men\r\nwere able to stretch their cramped limbs and run to and fro “in the\r\nkitchen,” as somebody put it. The sun was now rising gloriously. The\r\nBurberry suits were drying and the ice was melting off our beards. The\r\nsteaming food gave us new vigour, and within three-quarters of an hour\r\nwe were off again to the west with all sails set. We had given an\r\nadditional sail to the _Stancomb Wills_ and she was able to keep up\r\npretty well. We could see that we were on the true pack-edge, with the\r\nblue, rolling sea just outside the fringe of ice to the north.\r\nWhite-capped waves vied with the glittering floes in the setting of\r\nblue water, and countless seals basked and rolled on every piece of ice\r\nbig enough to form a raft.\r\n\r\nWe had been making westward with oars and sails since April 9, and fair\r\neasterly winds had prevailed. Hopes were running high as to the noon\r\nobservation for position. The optimists thought that we had done sixty\r\nmiles towards our goal, and the most cautious guess gave us at least\r\nthirty miles. The bright sunshine and the brilliant scene around us may\r\nhave influenced our anticipations. As noon approached I saw Worsley, as\r\nnavigating officer, balancing himself on the gunwale of the _Dudley\r\nDocker_ with his arm around the mast, ready to snap the sun. He got his\r\nobservation and we waited eagerly while he worked out the sight. Then\r\nthe _Dudley Docker_ ranged up alongside the _James Caird_ and I jumped\r\ninto Worsley’s boat in order to see the result. It was a grievous\r\ndisappointment. Instead of making a good run to the westward we had\r\nmade a big drift to the south-east. We were actually thirty miles to\r\nthe east of the position we had occupied when we left the floe on the\r\n9th. It has been noted by sealers operating in this area that there are\r\noften heavy sets to the east in the Belgica Straits, and no doubt it\r\nwas one of these sets that we had experienced. The originating cause\r\nwould be a north-westerly gale off Cape Horn, producing the swell that\r\nhad already caused us so much trouble. After a whispered consultation\r\nwith Worsley and Wild, I announced that we had not made as much\r\nprogress as we expected, but I did not inform the hands of our\r\nretrograde movement.\r\n\r\nThe question of our course now demanded further consideration.\r\nDeception Island seemed to be beyond our reach. The wind was foul for\r\nElephant Island, and as the sea was clear to the south-west; I\r\ndiscussed with Worsley and Wild the advisability of proceeding to Hope\r\nBay on the mainland of the Antarctic Continent, now only eighty miles\r\ndistant. Elephant Island was the nearest land, but it lay outside the\r\nmain body of pack, and even if the wind had been fair we would have\r\nhesitated at that particular time to face the high sea that was running\r\nin the open. We laid a course roughly for Hope Bay, and the boats moved\r\non again. I gave Worsley a line for a berg ahead and told him, if\r\npossible, to make fast before darkness set in. This was about three\r\no’clock in the afternoon. We had set sail, and as the _Stancomb Wills_\r\ncould not keep up with the other two boats I took her in tow, not being\r\nanxious to repeat the experience of the day we left the reeling berg.\r\nThe _Dudley Docker_ went ahead, but came beating down towards us at\r\ndusk. Worsley had been close to the berg, and he reported that it was\r\nunapproachable. It was rolling in the swell and displaying an ugly\r\nice-foot. The news was bad. In the failing light we turned towards a\r\nline of pack, and found it so tossed and churned by the sea that no\r\nfragment remained big enough to give us an anchorage and shelter. Two\r\nmiles away we could see a larger piece of ice, and to it we managed,\r\nafter some trouble, to secure the boats. I brought my boat bow on to\r\nthe floe, whilst Howe, with the painter in his hand, stood ready to\r\njump. Standing up to watch our chance, while the oars were held ready\r\nto back the moment Howe had made his leap, I could see that there would\r\nbe no possibility of getting the galley ashore that night. Howe just\r\nmanaged to get a footing on the edge of the floe, and then made the\r\npainter fast to a hummock. The other two boats were fastened alongside\r\nthe _James Caird_. They could not lie astern of us in a line, since\r\ncakes of ice came drifting round the floe and gathering under its lee.\r\nAs it was we spent the next two hours poling off the drifting ice that\r\nsurged towards us. The blubber-stove could not be used, so we started\r\nthe Primus lamps. There was a rough, choppy sea, and the _Dudley\r\nDocker_ could not get her Primus under way, something being adrift. The\r\nmen in that boat had to wait until the cook on the _James Caird_ had\r\nboiled up the first pot of milk.\r\n\r\nThe boats were bumping so heavily that I had to slack away the painter\r\nof the _Stancomb Wills_ and put her astern. Much ice was coming round\r\nthe floe and had to be poled off. Then the _Dudley Docker_, being the\r\nheavier boat, began to damage the _James Caird_, and I slacked the\r\n_Dudley Docker_ away. The _James Caird_ remained moored to the ice,\r\nwith the _Dudley Docker_ and the _Stancomb Wills_ in line behind her.\r\nThe darkness had become complete, and we strained our eye to see the\r\nfragments of ice that threatened us. Presently we thought we saw a\r\ngreat berg bearing down upon us, its form outlined against the sky, but\r\nthis startling spectacle resolved itself into a low-lying cloud in\r\nfront of the rising moon. The moon appeared in a clear sky. The wind\r\nshifted to the south-east as the light improved and drove the boats\r\nbroadside on towards the jagged edge of the floe. We had to cut the\r\npainter of the _James Caird_ and pole her off, thus losing much\r\nvaluable rope. There was no time to cast off. Then we pushed away from\r\nthe floe, and all night long we lay in the open, freezing sea, the\r\n_Dudley Docker_ now ahead, the _James Caird_ astern of her, and the\r\n_Stancomb Wills_ third in the line. The boats were attached to one\r\nanother by their painters. Most of the time the _Dudley Docker_ kept\r\nthe _James Caird_ and the _Stancomb Wills_ up to the swell, and the men\r\nwho were rowing were in better pass than those in the other boats,\r\nwaiting inactive for the dawn. The temperature was down to 4° below\r\nzero, and a film of ice formed on the surface of the sea. When we were\r\nnot on watch we lay in each other’s arms for warmth. Our frozen suits\r\nthawed where our bodies met, and as the slightest movement exposed\r\nthese comparatively warm spots to the biting air, we clung motionless,\r\nwhispering each to his companion our hopes and thoughts. Occasionally\r\nfrom an almost clear sky came snow-showers, falling silently on the sea\r\nand laying a thin shroud of white over our bodies and our boats.\r\n\r\nThe dawn of April 13 came clear and bright, with occasional passing\r\nclouds. Most of the men were now looking seriously worn and strained.\r\nTheir lips were cracked and their eyes and eyelids showed red in their\r\nsalt-encrusted faces. The beards even of the younger men might have\r\nbeen those of patriarchs, for the frost and the salt spray had made\r\nthem white. I called the _Dudley Docker_ alongside and found the\r\ncondition of the people there was no better than in the _James Caird_.\r\nObviously we must make land quickly, and I decided to run for Elephant\r\nIsland. The wind had shifted fair for that rocky isle, then about one\r\nhundred miles away, and the pack that separated us from Hope Bay had\r\nclosed up during the night from the south. At 6 p.m. we made a\r\ndistribution of stores among the three boats, in view of the\r\npossibility of their being separated. The preparation of a hot\r\nbreakfast was out of the question. The breeze was strong and the sea\r\nwas running high in the loose pack around us. We had a cold meal, and I\r\ngave orders that all hands might eat as much as they pleased, this\r\nconcession being due partly to a realization that we would have to\r\njettison some of our stores when we reached open sea in order to\r\nlighten the boats. I hoped, moreover, that a full meal of cold rations\r\nwould compensate to some extent for the lack of warm food and shelter.\r\nUnfortunately, some of the men were unable to take advantage of the\r\nextra food owing to seasickness. Poor fellows, it was bad enough to be\r\nhuddled in the deeply laden, spray-swept boats, frost-bitten and\r\nhalf-frozen, without having the pangs of seasickness added to the list\r\nof their woes. But some smiles were caused even then by the plight of\r\none man, who had a habit of accumulating bits of food against the day\r\nof starvation that he seemed always to think was at hand, and who was\r\ncondemned now to watch impotently while hungry comrades with\r\nundisturbed stomachs made biscuits, rations, and sugar disappear with\r\nextraordinary rapidity.\r\n\r\nWe ran before the wind through the loose pack, a man in the bow of each\r\nboat trying to pole off with a broken oar the lumps of ice that could\r\nnot be avoided. I regarded speed as essential. Sometimes collisions\r\nwere not averted. The _James Caird_ was in the lead, where she bore the\r\nbrunt of the encounter with lurking fragments, and she was holed above\r\nthe water-line by a sharp spur of ice, but this mishap did not stay us.\r\nLater the wind became stronger and we had to reef sails, so as not to\r\nstrike the ice too heavily. The _Dudley Docker_ came next to the _James\r\nCaird_ and the _Stancomb Wills_ followed. I had given order that the\r\nboats should keep 30 or 40 yds. apart, so as to reduce the danger of a\r\ncollision if one boat was checked by the ice. The pack was thinning,\r\nand we came to occasional open areas where thin ice had formed during\r\nthe night. When we encountered this new ice we had to shake the reef\r\nout of the sails in order to force a way through. Outside of the pack\r\nthe wind must have been of hurricane force. Thousands of small dead\r\nfish were to be seen, killed probably by a cold current and the heavy\r\nweather. They floated in the water and lay on the ice, where they had\r\nbeen cast by the waves. The petrels and skua-gulls were swooping down\r\nand picking them up like sardines off toast.\r\n\r\nWe made our way through the lanes till at noon we were suddenly spewed\r\nout of the pack into the open ocean. Dark blue and sapphire green ran\r\nthe seas. Our sails were soon up, and with a fair wind we moved over\r\nthe waves like three Viking ships on the quest of a lost Atlantis. With\r\nthe sheet well out and the sun shining bright above, we enjoyed for a\r\nfew hours a sense of the freedom and magic of the sea, compensating us\r\nfor pain and trouble in the days that had passed. At last we were free\r\nfrom the ice, in water that our boats could navigate. Thoughts of home,\r\nstifled by the deadening weight of anxious days and nights, came to\r\nbirth once more, and the difficulties that had still to be overcome\r\ndwindled in fancy almost to nothing.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon we had to take a second reef in the sails, for the\r\nwind freshened and the deeply laden boats were shipping much water and\r\nsteering badly in the rising sea. I had laid the course for Elephant\r\nIsland and we were making good progress. The _Dudley Docker_ ran down\r\nto me at dusk and Worsley suggested that we should stand on all night;\r\nbut already the _Stancomb Wills_ was barely discernible among the\r\nrollers in the gathering dusk, and I decided that it would be safer to\r\nheave to and wait for the daylight. It would never have done for the\r\nboats to have become separated from one another during the night. The\r\nparty must be kept together, and, moreover, I thought it possible that\r\nwe might overrun our goal in the darkness and not be able to return. So\r\nwe made a sea-anchor of oars and hove to, the _Dudley Docker_ in the\r\nlead, since she had the longest painter. The _James Caird_ swung astern\r\nof the _Dudley Docker_ and the _Stancomb Wills_ again had the third\r\nplace. We ate a cold meal and did what little we could to make things\r\ncomfortable for the hours of darkness. Rest was not for us. During the\r\ngreater part of the night the sprays broke over the boats and froze in\r\nmasses of ice, especially at the stern and bows. This ice had to be\r\nbroken away in order to prevent the boats growing too heavy. The\r\ntemperature was below zero and the wind penetrated our clothes and\r\nchilled us almost unbearably. I doubted if all the men would survive\r\nthat night. One of our troubles was lack of water. We had emerged so\r\nsuddenly from the pack into the open sea that we had not had time to\r\ntake aboard ice for melting in the cookers, and without ice we could\r\nnot have hot food. The _Dudley Docker_ had one lump of ice weighing\r\nabout ten pounds, and this was shared out among all hands. We sucked\r\nsmall pieces and got a little relief from thirst engendered by the salt\r\nspray, but at the same time we reduced our bodily heat. The condition\r\nof most of the men was pitiable. All of us had swollen mouths and we\r\ncould hardly touch the food. I longed intensely for the dawn. I called\r\nout to the other boats at intervals during the night, asking how things\r\nwere with them. The men always managed to reply cheerfully. One of the\r\npeople on the _Stancomb Wills_ shouted, “We are doing all right, but I\r\nwould like some dry mitts.” The jest brought a smile to cracked lips.\r\nHe might as well have asked for the moon. The only dry things aboard\r\nthe boats were swollen mouths and burning tongues. Thirst is one of the\r\ntroubles that confront the traveller in polar regions. Ice may be\r\nplentiful on every hand, but it does not become drinkable until it is\r\nmelted, and the amount that may be dissolved in the mouth is limited.\r\nWe had been thirsty during the days of heavy pulling in the pack, and\r\nour condition was aggravated quickly by the salt spray. Our\r\nsleeping-bags would have given us some warmth, but they were not within\r\nour reach. They were packed under the tents in the bows, where a\r\nmail-like coating of ice enclosed them, and we were so cramped that we\r\ncould not pull them out.\r\n\r\nAt last daylight came, and with the dawn the weather cleared and the\r\nwind fell to a gentle south-westerly breeze. A magnificent sunrise\r\nheralded in what we hoped would be our last day in the boats. Rose-pink\r\nin the growing light, the lofty peak of Clarence Island told of the\r\ncoming glory of the sun. The sky grew blue above us and the crests of\r\nthe waves sparkled cheerfully. As soon as it was light enough we\r\nchipped and scraped the ice off the bows and sterns. The rudders had\r\nbeen unshipped during the night in order to avoid the painters catching\r\nthem. We cast off our ice-anchor and pulled the oars aboard. They had\r\ngrown during the night to the thickness of telegraph-poles while rising\r\nand falling in the freezing seas, and had to be chipped clear before\r\nthey could be brought inboard.\r\n\r\nWe were dreadfully thirsty now. We found that we could get momentary\r\nrelief by chewing pieces of raw seal meat and swallowing the blood, but\r\nthirst came back with redoubled force owing to the saltness of the\r\nflesh. I gave orders, therefore, that meat was to be served out only at\r\nstated intervals during the day or when thirst seemed to threaten the\r\nreason of any particular individual. In the full daylight Elephant\r\nIsland showed cold and severe to the north-north-west. The island was\r\non the bearings that Worsley had laid down, and I congratulated him on\r\nthe accuracy of his navigation under difficult circumstances, with two\r\ndays dead reckoning while following a devious course through the\r\npack-ice and after drifting during two nights at the mercy of wind and\r\nwaves. The _Stancomb Wills_ came up and McIlroy reported that\r\nBlackborrow’s feet were very badly frost-bitten. This was unfortunate,\r\nbut nothing could be done. Most of the people were frost-bitten to some\r\nextent, and it was interesting to notice that the “oldtimers,” Wild,\r\nCrean, Hurley, and I, were all right. Apparently we were acclimatized\r\nto ordinary Antarctic temperature, though we learned later that we were\r\nnot immune.\r\n\r\nAll day, with a gentle breeze on our port bow, we sailed and pulled\r\nthrough a clear sea. We would have given all the tea in China for a\r\nlump of ice to melt into water, but no ice was within our reach. Three\r\nbergs were in sight and we pulled towards them, hoping that a trail of\r\nbrash would be floating on the sea to leeward; but they were hard and\r\nblue, devoid of any sign of cleavage, and the swell that surged around\r\nthem as they rose and fell made it impossible for us to approach\r\nclosely. The wind was gradually hauling ahead, and as the day wore on\r\nthe rays of the sun beat fiercely down from a cloudless sky on\r\npain-racked men. Progress was slow, but gradually Elephant Island came\r\nnearer. Always while I attended to the other boats, signalling and\r\nordering, Wild sat at the tiller of the _James Caird_. He seemed\r\nunmoved by fatigue and unshaken by privation. About four o’clock in the\r\nafternoon a stiff breeze came up ahead and, blowing against the\r\ncurrent, soon produced a choppy sea. During the next hour of hard\r\npulling we seemed to make no progress at all. The _James Caird_ and the\r\n_Dudley Docker_ had been towing the _Stancomb Wills_ in turn, but my\r\nboat now took the _Stancomb Wills_ in tow permanently, as the _James\r\nCaird_ could carry more sail than the _Dudley Docker_ in the freshening\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nWe were making up for the south-east side of Elephant Island, the wind\r\nbeing between north-west and west. The boats, held as close to the wind\r\nas possible, moved slowly, and when darkness set in our goal was still\r\nsome miles away. A heavy sea was running. We soon lost sight of the\r\n_Stancomb Wills_, astern of the _James Caird_ at the length of the\r\npainter, but occasionally the white gleam of broken water revealed her\r\npresence. When the darkness was complete I sat in the stern with my\r\nhand on the painter, so that I might know if the other boat broke away,\r\nand I kept that position during the night. The rope grew heavy with the\r\nice as the unseen seas surged past us and our little craft tossed to\r\nthe motion of the waters. Just at dusk I had told the men on the\r\n_Stancomb Wills_ that if their boat broke away during the night and\r\nthey were unable to pull against the wind, they could run for the east\r\nside of Clarence Island and await our coming there. Even though we\r\ncould not land on Elephant Island, it would not do to have the third\r\nboat adrift.\r\n\r\nIt was a stern night. The men, except the watch, crouched and huddled\r\nin the bottom of the boat, getting what little warmth they could from\r\nthe soaking sleeping-bags and each other’s bodies. Harder and harder\r\nblew the wind and fiercer and fiercer grew the sea. The boat plunged\r\nheavily through the squalls and came up to the wind, the sail shaking\r\nin the stiffest gusts. Every now and then, as the night wore on, the\r\nmoon would shine down through a rift in the driving clouds, and in the\r\nmomentary light I could see the ghostly faces of men, sitting up to\r\ntrim the boat as she heeled over to the wind. When the moon was hidden\r\nits presence was revealed still by the light reflected on the streaming\r\nglaciers of the island. The temperature had fallen very low, and it\r\nseemed that the general discomfort of our situation could scarcely have\r\nbeen increased; but the land looming ahead was a beacon of safety, and\r\nI think we were all buoyed up by the hope that the coming day would see\r\nthe end of our immediate troubles. At least we would get firm land\r\nunder our feet. While the painter of the _Stancomb Wills_ tightened and\r\ndrooped under my hand, my thoughts were busy with plans for the future.\r\n\r\nTowards midnight the wind shifted to the south-west, and this change\r\nenabled us to bear up closer to the island. A little later the _Dudley\r\nDocker_ ran down to the _James Caird_, and Worsley shouted a suggestion\r\nthat he should go ahead and search for a landing-place. His boat had\r\nthe heels of the _James Caird_, with the _Stancomb Wills_ in tow. I\r\ntold him he could try, but he must not lose sight of the _James Caird_.\r\nJust as he left me a heavy snow-squall came down, and in the darkness\r\nthe boats parted. I saw the _Dudley Docker_ no more. This separation\r\ncaused me some anxiety during the remaining hours of the night. A\r\ncross-sea was running and I could not feel sure that all was well with\r\nthe missing boat. The waves could not be seen in the darkness, though\r\nthe direction and force of the wind could be felt, and under such\r\nconditions, in an open boat, disaster might overtake the most\r\nexperienced navigator. I flashed our compass-lamp on the sail in the\r\nhope that the signal would be visible on board the _Dudley Docker_, but\r\ncould see no reply. We strained our eyes to windward in the darkness in\r\nthe hope of catching a return signal and repeated our flashes at\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\nMy anxiety, as a matter of fact, was groundless. I will quote Worsley’s\r\nown account of what happened to the _Dudley Docker:_\r\n\r\n“About midnight we lost sight of the _James Caird_ with the _Stancomb\r\nWills_ in tow, but not long after saw the light of the _James Caird’s_\r\ncompass-lamp, which Sir Ernest was flashing on their sail as a guide to\r\nus. We answered by lighting our candle under the tent and letting the\r\nlight shine through. At the same time we got the direction of the wind\r\nand how we were hauling from my little pocket-compass, the boat’s\r\ncompass being smashed. With this candle our poor fellows lit their\r\npipes, their only solace, as our raging thirst prevented us from eating\r\nanything. By this time we had got into a bad tide-rip, which, combined\r\nwith the heavy, lumpy sea, made it almost impossible to keep the\r\n_Dudley Docker_ from swamping. As it was we shipped several bad seas\r\nover the stern as well as abeam and over the bows, although we were ‘on\r\na wind.’ Lees, who owned himself to be a rotten oarsman, made good here\r\nby strenuous baling, in which he was well seconded by Cheetham.\r\nGreenstreet, a splendid fellow, relieved me at the tiller and helped\r\ngenerally. He and Macklin were my right and left bowers as stroke-oars\r\nthroughout. McLeod and Cheetham were two good sailors and oars, the\r\nformer a typical old deep-sea salt and growler, the latter a pirate to\r\nhis finger-tips. In the height of the gale that night Cheetham was\r\nbuying matches from me for bottles of champagne, one bottle per match\r\n(too cheap; I should have charged him two bottles). The champagne is to\r\nbe paid when he opens his pub in Hull and I am able to call that\r\nway.... We had now had one hundred and eight hours of toil, tumbling,\r\nfreezing, and soaking, with little or no sleep. I think Sir Ernest,\r\nWild, Greenstreet, and I could say that we had no sleep at all.\r\nAlthough it was sixteen months since we had been in a rough sea, only\r\nfour men were actually seasick, but several others were off colour.\r\n\r\n“The temperature was 20° below freezing-point; fortunately, we were\r\nspared the bitterly low temperature of the previous night.\r\nGreenstreet’s right foot got badly frost-bitten, but Lees restored it\r\nby holding it in his sweater against his stomach. Other men had minor\r\nfrost-bites, due principally to the fact that their clothes were soaked\r\nthrough with salt water.... We were close to the land as the morning\r\napproached, but could see nothing of it through the snow and spindrift.\r\nMy eyes began to fail me. Constant peering to windward, watching for\r\nseas to strike us, appeared to have given me a cold in the eyes. I\r\ncould not see or judge distance properly, and found myself falling\r\nasleep momentarily at the tiller. At 3 a.m. Greenstreet relieved me\r\nthere. I was so cramped from long hours, cold, and wet, in the\r\nconstrained position one was forced to assume on top of the gear and\r\nstores at the tiller, that the other men had to pull me amidships and\r\nstraighten me out like a jack-knife, first rubbing my thighs, groin,\r\nand stomach.\r\n\r\n“At daylight we found ourselves close alongside the land, but the\r\nweather was so thick that we could not see where to make for a landing.\r\nHaving taken the tiller again after an hour’s rest under the shelter\r\n(save the mark!) of the dripping tent, I ran the _Dudley Docker_ off\r\nbefore the gale, following the coast around to the north. This course\r\nfor the first hour was fairly risky, the heavy sea before which we were\r\nrunning threatening to swamp the boat, but by 8 a.m. we had obtained a\r\nslight lee from the land. Then I was able to keep her very close in,\r\nalong a glacier front, with the object of picking up lumps of\r\nfresh-water ice as we sailed through them. Our thirst was intense. We\r\nsoon had some ice aboard, and for the next hour and a half we sucked\r\nand chewed fragments of ice with greedy relish.\r\n\r\n“All this time we were coasting along beneath towering rocky cliffs and\r\nsheer glacier-faces, which offered not the slightest possibility of\r\nlanding anywhere. At 9.30 a.m. we spied a narrow, rocky beach at the\r\nbase of some very high crags and cliff, and made for it. To our joy, we\r\nsighted the _James Caird_ and the _Stancomb Wills_ sailing into the\r\nsame haven just ahead of us. We were so delighted that we gave three\r\ncheers, which were not heard aboard the other boats owing to the roar\r\nof the surf. However, we soon joined them and were able to exchange\r\nexperiences on the beach.”\r\n\r\nOur experiences on the _James Caird_ had been similar, although we had\r\nnot been able to keep up to windward as well as the _Dudley Docker_ had\r\ndone. This was fortunate as events proved, for the _James Caird_ and\r\n_Stancomb Wills_ went to leeward of the big bight the _Dudley Docker_\r\nentered and from which she had to turn out with the sea astern. We thus\r\navoided the risk of having the _Stancomb Wills_ swamped in the\r\nfollowing sea. The weather was very thick in the morning. Indeed at 7\r\na.m. we were right under the cliffs, which plunged sheer into the sea,\r\nbefore we saw them. We followed the coast towards the north, and ever\r\nthe precipitous cliffs and glacier-faces presented themselves to our\r\nsearching eyes. The sea broke heavily against these walls and a landing\r\nwould have been impossible under any conditions. We picked up pieces of\r\nice and sucked them eagerly. At 9 a.m. at the north-west end of the\r\nisland we saw a narrow beach at the foot of the cliffs. Outside lay a\r\nfringe of rocks heavily beaten by the surf but with a narrow channel\r\nshowing as a break in the foaming water. I decided that we must face\r\nthe hazards of this unattractive landing-place. Two days and nights\r\nwithout drink or hot food had played havoc with most of the men, and we\r\ncould not assume that any safer haven lay within our reach. The\r\n_Stancomb Wills_ was the lighter and handier boat—and I called her\r\nalongside with the intention of taking her through the gap first and\r\nascertaining the possibilities of a landing before the _James Caird_\r\nmade the venture. I was just climbing into the _Stancomb Wills_ when I\r\nsaw the _Dudley Docker_ coming up astern under sail. The sight took a\r\ngreat load off my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The First Landing ever made on Elephant Island, April\r\n15, 1916]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “We Pulled the Three Boats a little Higher on the\r\nBeach”]\r\n\r\n\r\nRowing carefully and avoiding the blind rollers which showed where\r\nsunken rocks lay, we brought the _Stancomb Wills_ towards the opening\r\nin the reef. Then, with a few strong strokes we shot through on the top\r\nof a swell and ran the boat on to a stony beach. The next swell lifted\r\nher a little farther. This was the first landing ever made on Elephant\r\nIsland, and a thought came to me that the honour should belong to the\r\nyoungest member of the Expedition, so I told Blackborrow to jump over.\r\nHe seemed to be in a state almost of coma, and in order to avoid delay\r\nI helped him, perhaps a little roughly, over the side of the boat. He\r\npromptly sat down in the surf and did not move. Then I suddenly\r\nrealized what I had forgotten, that both his feet were frost-bitten\r\nbadly. Some of us jumped over and pulled him into a dry place. It was a\r\nrather rough experience for Blackborrow, but, anyhow, he is now able to\r\nsay that he was the first man to sit on Elephant Island. Possibly at\r\nthe time he would have been willing to forgo any distinction of the\r\nkind. We landed the cook with his blubber-stove, a supply of fuel and\r\nsome packets of dried milk, and also several of the men. Then the rest\r\nof us pulled out again to pilot the other boats through the channel.\r\nThe _James Caird_ was too heavy to be beached directly, so after\r\nlanding most of the men from the _Dudley Docker_ and the _Stancomb\r\nWills_ I superintended the transhipment of the _James Caird’s_ gear\r\noutside the reef. Then we all made the passage, and within a few\r\nminutes the three boats were aground. A curious spectacle met my eyes\r\nwhen I landed the second time. Some of the men were reeling about the\r\nbeach as if they had found an unlimited supply of alcoholic liquor on\r\nthe desolate shore. They were laughing uproariously, picking up stones\r\nand letting handfuls of pebbles trickle between their fingers like\r\nmisers gloating over hoarded gold. The smiles and laughter, which\r\ncaused cracked lips to bleed afresh, and the gleeful exclamations at\r\nthe sight of two live seals on the beach made me think for a moment of\r\nthat glittering hour of childhood when the door is open at last and the\r\nChristmas-tree in all its wonder bursts upon the vision. I remember\r\nthat Wild, who always rose superior to fortune, bad and good, came\r\nashore as I was looking at the men and stood beside me as easy and\r\nunconcerned as if he had stepped out of his car for a stroll in the\r\npark.\r\n\r\nSoon half a dozen of us had the stores ashore. Our strength was nearly\r\nexhausted and it was heavy work carrying our goods over the rough\r\npebbles and rocks to the foot of the cliff, but we dare not leave\r\nanything within reach of the tide. We had to wade knee-deep in the icy\r\nwater in order to lift the gear from the boats. When the work was done\r\nwe pulled the three boats a little higher on the beach and turned\r\ngratefully to enjoy the hot drink the cook had prepared. Those of us\r\nwho were comparatively fit had to wait until the weaker members of the\r\nparty had been supplied; but every man had his pannikin of hot milk in\r\nthe end, and never did anything taste better. Seal steak and blubber\r\nfollowed, for the seals that had been careless enough to await our\r\narrival on the beach had already given up their lives. There was no\r\nrest for the cook. The blubber-stove flared and spluttered fiercely as\r\nhe cooked, not one meal, but many meals, which merged into a day-long\r\nbout of eating. We drank water and ate seal meat until every man had\r\nreached the limit of his capacity.\r\n\r\nThe tents were pitched with oars for supports, and by 3 p.m. our camp\r\nwas in order. The original framework of the tents had been cast adrift\r\non one of the floes in order to save weight. Most of the men turned in\r\nearly for a safe and glorious sleep, to be broken only by the call to\r\ntake a turn on watch. The chief duty of the watchman was to keep the\r\nblubber-stove alight, and each man on duty appeared to find it\r\nnecessary to cook himself a meal during his watch, and a supper before\r\nhe turned in again.\r\n\r\nWild, Worsley, and Hurley accompanied me on an inspection of our beach\r\nbefore getting into the tents. I almost wished then that I had\r\npostponed the examination until after sleep, but the sense of caution\r\nthat the uncertainties of polar travel implant in one’s mind had made\r\nme uneasy. The outlook we found to be anything but cheering. Obvious\r\nsigns showed that at spring tides the little beach would be covered by\r\nthe water right up to the foot of the cliffs. In a strong\r\nnorth-easterly gale, such as we might expect to experience at any time,\r\nthe waves would pound over the scant barrier of the reef and break\r\nagainst the sheer sides of the rocky wall behind us. Well-marked\r\nterraces showed the effect of other gales, and right at the back of the\r\nbeach was a small bit of wreckage not more than three feet long,\r\nrounded by the constant chafing it had endured. Obviously we must find\r\nsome better resting-place. I decided not to share with the men the\r\nknowledge of the uncertainties of our situation until they had enjoyed\r\nthe full sweetness of rest untroubled by the thought that at any minute\r\nthey might be called to face peril again. The threat of the sea had\r\nbeen our portion during many, many days, and a respite meant much to\r\nweary bodies and jaded minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying plan will indicate our exact position more clearly\r\nthan I can describe it. The cliffs at the back of the beach were\r\ninaccessible except at two points where there were steep snow-slopes.\r\nWe were not worried now about food, for, apart from our own rations,\r\nthere were seals on the beach and we could see others in the water\r\noutside the reef. Every now and then one of the animals would rise in\r\nthe shallows and crawl up on the beach, which evidently was a\r\nrecognized place of resort for its kind. A small rocky island which\r\nprotected us to some extent from the north-westerly wind carried a\r\nringed-penguin rookery. These birds were of migratory habit and might\r\nbe expected to leave us before the winter set in fully, but in the\r\nmeantime they were within our reach. These attractions, however, were\r\noverridden by the fact that the beach was open to the attack of wind\r\nand sea from the north-east and east. Easterly gales are more prevalent\r\nthan western in that area of the Antarctic during the winter. Before\r\nturning in that night I studied the whole position and weighed every\r\nchance of getting the boats and our stores into a place of safety out\r\nof reach of the water. We ourselves might have clambered a little way\r\nup the snow-slopes, but we could not have taken the boats with us. The\r\ninterior of the island was quite inaccessible. We climbed up one of the\r\nslopes and found ourselves stopped soon by overhanging cliffs. The\r\nrocks behind the camp were much weathered, and we noticed the sharp,\r\nunworn boulders that had fallen from above. Clearly there was a danger\r\nfrom overhead if we camped at the back of the beach. We must move on.\r\nWith that thought in mind I reached my tent and fell asleep on the\r\nrubbly ground, which gave a comforting sense of stability. The fairy\r\nprincess who would not rest on her seven downy mattresses because a pea\r\nlay underneath the pile might not have understood the pleasure we all\r\nderived from the irregularities of the stones, which could not possibly\r\nbreak beneath us or drift away; the very searching lumps were sweet\r\nreminders of our safety.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning (April 15) all hands were astir. The sun soon shone\r\nbrightly and we spread out our wet gear to dry, till the beach looked\r\nlike a particularly disreputable gipsy camp. The boots and clothing had\r\nsuffered considerably during our travels. I had decided to send Wild\r\nalong the coast in the _Stancomb Wills_ to look for a new\r\ncamping-ground, and he and I discussed the details of the journey while\r\neating our breakfast of hot seal steak and blubber. The camp I wished\r\nto find was one where the party could live for weeks or even months in\r\nsafety, without danger from sea or wind in the heaviest winter gale.\r\nWild was to proceed westwards along the coast and was to take with him\r\nfour of the fittest men, Marston, Crean, Vincent, and McCarthy. If he\r\ndid not return before dark we were to light a flare, which would serve\r\nhim as a guide to the entrance of the channel. The _Stancomb Wills_\r\npushed off at 11 a.m. and quickly passed out of sight around the\r\nisland. Then Hurley and I walked along the beach towards the west,\r\nclimbing through a gap between the cliff and a great detached pillar of\r\nbasalt. The narrow strip of beach was cumbered with masses of rock that\r\nhad fallen from the cliffs. We struggled along for two miles or more in\r\nthe search for a place where we could get the boats ashore and make a\r\npermanent camp in the event of Wild’s search proving fruitless, but\r\nafter three hours’ vain toil we had to turn back. We had found on the\r\nfar side of the pillar of basalt a crevice in the rocks beyond the\r\nreach of all but the heaviest gales. Rounded pebbles showed that the\r\nseas reached the spot on occasions. Here I decided to depot ten cases\r\nof Bovril sledging ration in case of our having to move away quickly.\r\nWe could come back for the food at a later date if opportunity offered.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The First Drink and Hot Food for Three-and-a-Half Days]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mount Frank Houlder, Elephant Island]\r\n\r\n\r\nReturning to the camp, we found the men resting or attending to their\r\ngear. Clark had tried angling in the shallows off the rocks and had\r\nsecured one or two small fish. The day passed quietly. Rusty needles\r\nwere rubbed bright on the rocks and clothes were mended and darned. A\r\nfeeling of tiredness—due, I suppose, to reaction after the strain of\r\nthe preceding days—overtook us, but the rising tide, coming farther up\r\nthe beach than it had done on the day before, forced us to labour at\r\nthe boats, which we hauled slowly to a higher ledge. We found it\r\nnecessary to move our makeshift camp nearer the cliff. I portioned out\r\nthe available ground for the tents, the galley, and other purposes, as\r\nevery foot was of value. When night arrived the _Stancomb Wills_ was\r\nstill away, so I had a blubber-flare lit at the head of the channel.\r\n\r\nAbout 8 p.m. we heard a hail in the distance. We could see nothing, but\r\nsoon like a pale ghost out of the darkness came the boat, the faces of\r\nthe men showing white in the glare of the fire. Wild ran her on the\r\nbeach with the swell, and within a couple of minutes we had dragged her\r\nto a place of safety. I was waiting Wild’s report with keen anxiety,\r\nand my relief was great when he told me that he had discovered a sandy\r\nspit seven miles to the west, about 200 yds. long, running out at right\r\nangles to the coast and terminating at the seaward end in a mass of\r\nrock. A long snow-slope joined the spit at the shore end, and it seemed\r\npossible that a “dugout” could be made in the snow. The spit, in any\r\ncase, would be a great improvement on our narrow beach. Wild added that\r\nthe place he described was the only possible camping-ground he had\r\nseen. Beyond, to the west and south-west, lay a frowning line of cliffs\r\nand glaciers, sheer to the water’s edge. He thought that in very heavy\r\ngales either from the south-west or east the spit would be spray-blown,\r\nbut that the seas would not actually break over it. The boats could be\r\nrun up on a shelving beach.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing this good news I was eager to get away from the beach\r\ncamp. The wind when blowing was favourable for the run along the coast.\r\nThe weather had been fine for two days and a change might come at any\r\nhour. I told all hands that we would make a start early on the\r\nfollowing morning. A newly killed seal provided a luxurious supper of\r\nsteak and blubber, and then we slept comfortably till the dawn.\r\n\r\nThe morning of April 17 came fine and clear. The sea was smooth, but in\r\nthe offing we could see a line of pack, which seemed to be approaching.\r\nWe had noticed already pack and bergs being driven by the current to\r\nthe east and then sometimes coming back with a rush to the west. The\r\ncurrent ran as fast as five miles an hour, and it was a set of this\r\nkind that had delayed Wild on his return from the spit. The rise and\r\nfall of the tide was only about five feet at this time, but the moon\r\nwas making for full and the tides were increasing. The appearance of\r\nice emphasized the importance of getting away promptly. It would be a\r\nserious matter to be prisoned on the beach by the pack. The boats were\r\nsoon afloat in the shallows, and after a hurried breakfast all hands\r\nworked hard getting our gear and stores aboard. A mishap befell us when\r\nwe were launching the boats. We were using oars as rollers, and three\r\nof these were broken, leaving us short for the journey that had still\r\nto be undertaken. The preparations took longer than I had expected;\r\nindeed, there seemed to be some reluctance on the part of several men\r\nto leave the barren safety of the little beach and venture once more on\r\nthe ocean. But the move was imperative, and by 11 a.m. we were away,\r\nthe _James Caird_ leading. Just as we rounded the small island occupied\r\nby the ringed penguins the “willywaw” swooped down from the 2000-ft.\r\ncliffs behind us, a herald of the southerly gale that was to spring up\r\nwithin half an hour.\r\n\r\nSoon we were straining at the oars with the gale on our bows. Never had\r\nwe found a more severe task. The wind shifted from the south to the\r\nsouth-west, and the shortage of oars became a serious matter. The\r\n_James Caird_, being the heaviest boat, had to keep a full complement\r\nof rowers, while the _Dudley Docker_ and the _Stancomb Wills_ went\r\nshort and took turns using the odd oar. A big swell was thundering\r\nagainst the cliffs and at times we were almost driven on to the rocks\r\nby swirling green waters. We had to keep close inshore in order to\r\navoid being embroiled in the raging sea, which was lashed snow-white\r\nand quickened by the furious squalls into a living mass of sprays.\r\nAfter two hours of strenuous labour we were almost exhausted, but we\r\nwere fortunate enough to find comparative shelter behind a point of\r\nrock. Overhead towered the sheer cliffs for hundreds of feet, the\r\nsea-birds that fluttered from the crannies of the rock dwarfed by the\r\nheight. The boats rose and fell in the big swell, but the sea was not\r\nbreaking in our little haven, and we rested there while we ate our cold\r\nration. Some of the men had to stand by the oars in order to pole the\r\nboats off the cliff-face.\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour’s pause I gave the order to start again. The _Dudley\r\nDocker_ was pulling with three oars, as the _Stancomb Wills_ had the\r\nodd one, and she fell away to leeward in a particularly heavy squall. I\r\nanxiously watched her battling up against wind and sea. It would have\r\nbeen useless to take the _James Caird_ back to the assistance of the\r\n_Dudley Docker_ since we were hard pressed to make any progress\r\nourselves in the heavier boat. The only thing was to go ahead and hope\r\nfor the best. All hands were wet to the skin again and many men were\r\nfeeling the cold severely. We forged on slowly and passed inside a\r\ngreat pillar of rock standing out to sea and towering to a height of\r\nabout 2400 ft. A line of reef stretched between the shore and this\r\npillar, and I thought as we approached that we would have to face the\r\nraging sea outside; but a break in the white surf revealed a gap in the\r\nreef and we laboured through, with the wind driving clouds of spray on\r\nour port beam. The _Stancomb Wills_ followed safely. In the stinging\r\nspray I lost sight of the _Dudley Docker_ altogether. It was obvious\r\nshe would have to go outside the pillar as she was making so much\r\nleeway, but I could not see what happened to her and I dared not pause.\r\nIt was a bad time. At last, about 5 p.m., the _James Caird_ and the\r\n_Stancomb Wills_ reached comparatively calm water and we saw Wild’s\r\nbeach just ahead of us. I looked back vainly for the _Dudley Docker_.\r\n\r\nRocks studded the shallow water round the spit and the sea surged\r\namongst them. I ordered the _Stancomb Wills_ to run on to the beach at\r\nthe place that looked smoothest, and in a few moments the first boat\r\nwas ashore, the men jumping out and holding her against the receding\r\nwave. Immediately I saw she was safe I ran the _James Caird_ in. Some\r\nof us scrambled up the beach through the fringe of the surf and slipped\r\nthe painter round a rock, so as to hold the boat against the backwash.\r\nThen we began to get the stores and gear out, working like men\r\npossessed, for the boats could not be pulled up till they had been\r\nemptied. The blubber-stove was quickly alight and the cook began to\r\nprepare a hot drink. We were labouring at the boats when I noticed\r\nRickenson turn white and stagger in the surf. I pulled him out of reach\r\nof the water and sent him up to the stove, which had been placed in the\r\nshelter of some rocks. McIlroy went to him and found that his heart had\r\nbeen temporarily unequal to the strain placed upon it. He was in a bad\r\nway and needed prompt medical attention. There are some men who will do\r\nmore than their share of work and who will attempt more than they are\r\nphysically able to accomplish. Rickenson was one of these eager souls.\r\nHe was suffering, like many other members of the Expedition, from bad\r\nsalt-water boils. Our wrists, arms, and legs were attacked. Apparently\r\nthis infliction was due to constant soaking with sea-water, the chafing\r\nof wet clothes, and exposure.\r\n\r\nI was very anxious about the _Dudley Docker_, and my eyes as well as my\r\nthoughts were turned eastward as we carried the stores ashore; but\r\nwithin half an hour the missing boat appeared, labouring through the\r\nspume-white sea, and presently she reached the comparative calm of the\r\nbay. We watched her coming with that sense of relief that the mariner\r\nfeels when he crosses the harbour-bar. The tide was going out rapidly,\r\nand Worsley lightened the _Dudley Docker_ by placing some cases on an\r\nouter rock, where they were retrieved subsequently. Then he beached his\r\nboat, and with many hands at work we soon had our belongings ashore and\r\nour three craft above high-water mark. The spit was by no means an\r\nideal camping-ground; it was rough, bleak, and inhospitable—just an\r\nacre or two of rock and shingle, with the sea foaming around it except\r\nwhere the snow-slope, running up to a glacier, formed the landward\r\nboundary. But some of the larger rocks provided a measure of shelter\r\nfrom the wind, and as we clustered round the blubber-stove, with the\r\nacrid smoke blowing into our faces, we were quite a cheerful company.\r\nAfter all, another stage of the homeward journey had been accomplished\r\nand we could afford to forget for an hour the problems of the future.\r\nLife was not so bad. We ate our evening meal while the snow drifted\r\ndown from the surface of the glacier, and our chilled bodies grew warm.\r\nThen we dried a little tobacco at the stove and enjoyed our pipes\r\nbefore we crawled into our tents. The snow had made it impossible for\r\nus to find the tide-line and we were uncertain how far the sea was\r\ngoing to encroach upon our beach. I pitched my tent on the seaward side\r\nof the camp so that I might have early warning of danger, and, sure\r\nenough, about 2 a.m. a little wave forced its way under the tent-cloth.\r\nThis was a practical demonstration that we had not gone far enough back\r\nfrom the sea, but in the semi-darkness it was difficult to see where we\r\ncould find safety. Perhaps it was fortunate that experience had inured\r\nus to the unpleasantness of sudden forced changes of camp. We took down\r\nthe tents and re-pitched them close against the high rocks at the\r\nseaward end of the spit, where large boulders made an uncomfortable\r\nresting-place. Snow was falling heavily. Then all hands had to assist\r\nin pulling the boats farther up the beach, and at this task we suffered\r\na serious misfortune. Two of our four bags of clothing had been placed\r\nunder the bilge of the _James Caird_, and before we realized the danger\r\na wave had lifted the boat and carried the two bags back into the surf.\r\nWe had no chance of recovering them. This accident did not complete the\r\ntale of the night’s misfortunes. The big eight-man tent was blown to\r\npieces in the early morning. Some of the men who had occupied it took\r\nrefuge in other tents, but several remained in their sleeping-bags\r\nunder the fragments of cloth until it was time to turn out.\r\n\r\nA southerly gale was blowing on the morning of April 18 and the\r\ndrifting snow was covering everything. The outlook was cheerless\r\nindeed, but much work had to be done and we could not yield to the\r\ndesire to remain in the sleeping-bags. Some sea-elephants were lying\r\nabout the beach above high-water mark, and we killed several of the\r\nyounger ones for their meat and blubber. The big tent could not be\r\nreplaced, and in order to provide shelter for the men we turned the\r\n_Dudley Docker_ upside down and wedged up the weather side with\r\nboulders. We also lashed the painter and stern-rope round the heaviest\r\nrocks we could find, so as to guard against the danger of the boat\r\nbeing moved by the wind. The two bags of clothing were bobbing about\r\namid the brash and glacier-ice to the windward side of the spit, and it\r\ndid not seem possible to reach them. The gale continued all day, and\r\nthe fine drift from the surface of the glacier was added to the big\r\nflakes of snow falling from the sky. I made a careful examination of\r\nthe spit with the object of ascertaining its possibilities as a\r\ncamping-ground. Apparently, some of the beach lay above high-water mark\r\nand the rocks that stood above the shingle gave a measure of shelter.\r\nIt would be possible to mount the snow-slope towards the glacier in\r\nfine weather, but I did not push my exploration in that direction\r\nduring the gale. At the seaward end of the spit was the mass of rock\r\nalready mentioned. A few thousand ringed penguins, with some gentoos,\r\nwere on these rocks, and we had noted this fact with a great deal of\r\nsatisfaction at the time of our landing. The ringed penguin is by no\r\nmeans the best of the penguins from the point of view of the hungry\r\ntraveller, but it represents food. At 8 a.m. that morning I noticed the\r\nringed penguins mustering in orderly fashion close to the water’s edge,\r\nand thought that they were preparing for the daily fishing excursion;\r\nbut presently it became apparent that some important move was on foot.\r\nThey were going to migrate, and with their departure much valuable food\r\nwould pass beyond our reach. Hurriedly we armed ourselves with pieces\r\nof sledge-runner and other improvised clubs, and started towards the\r\nrookery. We were too late. The leaders gave their squawk of command and\r\nthe columns took to the sea in unbroken ranks. Following their leaders,\r\nthe penguins dived through the surf and reappeared in the heaving water\r\nbeyond. A very few of the weaker birds took fright and made their way\r\nback to the beach, where they fell victims later to our needs; but the\r\nmain army went northwards and we saw them no more. We feared that the\r\ngentoo penguins might follow the example of their ringed cousins, but\r\nthey stayed with us; apparently they had not the migratory habit. They\r\nwere comparatively few in number, but from time to time they would come\r\nin from the sea and walk up our beach. The gentoo is the most strongly\r\nmarked of all the smaller varieties of penguins as far as colouring is\r\nconcerned, and it far surpasses the adelie in weight of legs and\r\nbreast, the points that particularly appealed to us.\r\n\r\nThe deserted rookery was sure to be above high-water mark at all times;\r\nand we mounted the rocky ledge in search of a place to pitch our tents.\r\nThe penguins knew better than to rest where the sea could reach them\r\neven when the highest tide was supported by the strongest gale. The\r\ndisadvantages of a camp on the rookery were obvious. The smell was\r\nstrong, to put it mildly, and was not likely to grow less pronounced\r\nwhen the warmth of our bodies thawed the surface. But our choice of\r\nplaces was not wide, and that afternoon we dug out a site for two tents\r\nin the debris of the rookery, levelling it off with snow and rocks. My\r\ntent, No. 1, was pitched close under the cliff, and there during my\r\nstay on Elephant Island I lived. Crean’s tent was close by, and the\r\nother three tents, which had fairly clean snow under them, were some\r\nyards away. The fifth tent was a ramshackle affair. The material of the\r\ntorn eight-man tent had been drawn over a rough framework of oars, and\r\nshelter of a kind provided for the men who occupied it.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of our camp, the checking of our gear, the killing and\r\nskinning of seals and sea-elephants occupied us during the day, and we\r\ntook to our sleeping-bags early. I and my companions in No. 1 tent were\r\nnot destined to spend a pleasant night. The heat of our bodies soon\r\nmelted the snow and refuse beneath us and the floor of the tent became\r\nan evil smelling yellow mud. The snow drifting from the cliff above us\r\nweighted the sides of the tent, and during the night a particularly\r\nstormy gust brought our little home down on top of us. We stayed\r\nunderneath the snow-laden cloth till the morning, for it seemed a\r\nhopeless business to set about re-pitching the tent amid the storm that\r\nwas raging in the darkness of the night.\r\n\r\nThe weather was still bad on the morning of April 19. Some of the men\r\nwere showing signs of demoralization. They were disinclined to leave\r\nthe tents when the hour came for turning out, and it was apparent they\r\nwere thinking more of the discomforts of the moment than of the good\r\nfortune that had brought us to sound ground and comparative safety. The\r\ncondition of the gloves and headgear shown me by some discouraged men\r\nillustrated the proverbial carelessness of the sailor. The articles had\r\nfrozen stiff during the night, and the owners considered, it appeared,\r\nthat this state of affairs provided them with a grievance, or at any\r\nrate gave them the right to grumble. They said they wanted dry clothes\r\nand that their health would not admit of their doing any work. Only by\r\nrather drastic methods were they induced to turn to. Frozen gloves and\r\nhelmets undoubtedly are very uncomfortable, and the proper thing is to\r\nkeep these articles thawed by placing them inside one’s shirt during\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nThe southerly gale, bringing with it much snow, was so severe that as I\r\nwent along the beach to kill a seal I was blown down by a gust. The\r\ncooking-pots from No. 2 tent took a flying run into the sea at the same\r\nmoment. A case of provisions which had been placed on them to keep them\r\nsafe had been capsized by a squall. These pots, fortunately, were not\r\nessential, since nearly all our cooking was done over the\r\nblubber-stove. The galley was set up by the rocks close to my tent, in\r\na hole we had dug through the debris of the penguin rookery. Cases of\r\nstores gave some shelter from the wind and a spread sail kept some of\r\nthe snow off the cook when he was at work. He had not much idle time.\r\nThe amount of seal and sea-elephant steak and blubber consumed by our\r\nhungry party was almost incredible. He did not lack assistance—the\r\nneighbourhood of the blubber-stove had attractions for every member of\r\nthe party; but he earned everybody’s gratitude by his unflagging energy\r\nin preparing meals that to us at least were savoury and satisfying.\r\nFrankly, we needed all the comfort that the hot food could give us. The\r\nicy fingers of the gale searched every cranny of our beach and pushed\r\nrelentlessly through our worn garments and tattered tents. The snow,\r\ndrifting from the glacier and falling from the skies, swathed us and\r\nour gear and set traps for our stumbling feet. The rising sea beat\r\nagainst the rocks and shingle and tossed fragments of floe-ice within a\r\nfew feet of our boats. Once during the morning the sun shone through\r\nthe racing clouds and we had a glimpse of blue sky; but the promise of\r\nfair weather was not redeemed. The consoling feature of the situation\r\nwas that our camp was safe. We could endure the discomforts, and I felt\r\nthat all hands would be benefited by the opportunity for rest and\r\nrecuperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\nTHE BOAT JOURNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe increasing sea made it necessary for us to drag the boats farther\r\nup the beach. This was a task for all hands, and after much labour we\r\ngot the boats into safe positions among the rocks and made fast the\r\npainters to big boulders. Then I discussed with Wild and Worsley the\r\nchances of reaching South Georgia before the winter locked the seas\r\nagainst us. Some effort had to be made to secure relief. Privation and\r\nexposure had left their mark on the party, and the health and mental\r\ncondition of several men were causing me serious anxiety. Blackborrow’s\r\nfeet, which had been frost-bitten during the boat journey, were in a\r\nbad way, and the two doctors feared that an operation would be\r\nnecessary. They told me that the toes would have to be amputated unless\r\nanimation could be restored within a short period. Then the food-supply\r\nwas a vital consideration. We had left ten cases of provisions in the\r\ncrevice of the rocks at our first camping-place on the island. An\r\nexamination of our stores showed that we had full rations for the whole\r\nparty for a period of five weeks. The rations could be spread over\r\nthree months on a reduced allowance and probably would be supplemented\r\nby seals and sea-elephants to some extent. I did not dare to count with\r\nfull confidence on supplies of meat and blubber, for the animals seemed\r\nto have deserted the beach and the winter was near. Our stocks included\r\nthree seals and two and a half skins (with blubber attached). We were\r\nmainly dependent on the blubber for fuel, and, after making a\r\npreliminary survey of the situation, I decided that the party must be\r\nlimited to one hot meal a day.\r\n\r\nA boat journey in search of relief was necessary and must not be\r\ndelayed. That conclusion was forced upon me. The nearest port where\r\nassistance could certainly be secured was Port Stanley, in the Falkland\r\nIslands, 540 miles away, but we could scarcely hope to beat up against\r\nthe prevailing north-westerly wind in a frail and weakened boat with a\r\nsmall sail area. South Georgia was over 800 miles away, but lay in the\r\narea of the west winds, and I could count upon finding whalers at any\r\nof the whaling-stations on the east coast. A boat party might make the\r\nvoyage and be back with relief within a month, provided that the sea\r\nwas clear of ice and the boat survive the great seas. It was not\r\ndifficult to decide that South Georgia must be the objective, and I\r\nproceeded to plan ways and means. The hazards of a boat journey across\r\n800 miles of stormy sub-Antarctic ocean were obvious, but I calculated\r\nthat at worst the venture would add nothing to the risks of the men\r\nleft on the island. There would be fewer mouths to feed during the\r\nwinter and the boat would not require to take more than one month’s\r\nprovisions for six men, for if we did not make South Georgia in that\r\ntime we were sure to go under. A consideration that had weight with me\r\nwas that there was no chance at all of any search being made for us on\r\nElephant Island.\r\n\r\nThe case required to be argued in some detail, since all hands knew\r\nthat the perils of the proposed journey were extreme. The risk was\r\njustified solely by our urgent need of assistance. The ocean south of\r\nCape Horn in the middle of May is known to be the most tempestuous\r\nstorm-swept area of water in the world. The weather then is unsettled,\r\nthe skies are dull and overcast, and the gales are almost unceasing. We\r\nhad to face these conditions in a small and weather-beaten boat,\r\nalready strained by the work of the months that had passed. Worsley and\r\nWild realized that the attempt must be made, and they both asked to be\r\nallowed to accompany me on the voyage. I told Wild at once that he\r\nwould have to stay behind. I relied upon him to hold the party together\r\nwhile I was away and to make the best of his way to Deception Island\r\nwith the men in the spring in the event of our failure to bring help.\r\nWorsley I would take with me, for I had a very high opinion of his\r\naccuracy and quickness as a navigator, and especially in the snapping\r\nand working out of positions in difficult circumstances—an opinion that\r\nwas only enhanced during the actual journey. Four other men would be\r\nrequired, and I decided to call for volunteers, although, as a matter\r\nof fact, I pretty well knew which of the people I would select. Crean I\r\nproposed to leave on the island as a right-hand man for Wild, but he\r\nbegged so hard to be allowed to come in the boat that, after\r\nconsultation with Wild, I promised to take him. I called the men\r\ntogether, explained my plan, and asked for volunteers. Many came\r\nforward at once. Some were not fit enough for the work that would have\r\nto be done, and others would not have been much use in the boat since\r\nthey were not seasoned sailors, though the experiences of recent months\r\nentitled them to some consideration as seafaring men. McIlroy and\r\nMacklin were both anxious to go but realized that their duty lay on the\r\nisland with the sick men. They suggested that I should take Blackborrow\r\nin order that he might have shelter and warmth as quickly as possible,\r\nbut I had to veto this idea. It would be hard enough for fit men to\r\nlive in the boat. Indeed, I did not see how a sick man, lying helpless\r\nin the bottom of the boat, could possibly survive in the heavy weather\r\nwe were sure to encounter. I finally selected McNeish, McCarthy, and\r\nVincent in addition to Worsley and Crean. The crew seemed a strong one,\r\nand as I looked at the men I felt confidence increasing.\r\n\r\nThe decision made, I walked through the blizzard with Worsley and Wild\r\nto examine the _James Caird_. The 20-ft. boat had never looked big; she\r\nappeared to have shrunk in some mysterious way when I viewed her in the\r\nlight of our new undertaking. She was an ordinary ship’s whaler, fairly\r\nstrong, but showing signs of the strains she had endured since the\r\ncrushing of the _Endurance_. Where she was holed in leaving the pack\r\nwas, fortunately, about the water-line and easily patched. Standing\r\nbeside her, we glanced at the fringe of the storm-swept, tumultuous sea\r\nthat formed our path. Clearly, our voyage would be a big adventure. I\r\ncalled the carpenter and asked him if he could do anything to make the\r\nboat more seaworthy. He first inquired if he was to go with me, and\r\nseemed quite pleased when I said “Yes.” He was over fifty years of age\r\nand not altogether fit, but he had a good knowledge of sailing-boats\r\nand was very quick. McCarthy said that he could contrive some sort of\r\ncovering for the _James Caird_ if he might use the lids of the cases\r\nand the four sledge-runners that we had lashed inside the boat for use\r\nin the event of a landing on Graham Land at Wilhelmina Bay. This bay,\r\nat one time the goal of our desire, had been left behind in the course\r\nof our drift, but we had retained the runners. The carpenter proposed\r\nto complete the covering with some of our canvas; and he set about\r\nmaking his plans at once.\r\n\r\nNoon had passed and the gale was more severe than ever. We could not\r\nproceed with our preparations that day. The tents were suffering in the\r\nwind and the sea was rising. We made our way to the snow-slope at the\r\nshoreward end of the spit, with the intention of digging a hole in the\r\nsnow large enough to provide shelter for the party. I had an idea that\r\nWild and his men might camp there during my absence, since it seemed\r\nimpossible that the tents could hold together for many more days\r\nagainst the attacks of the wind; but an examination of the spot\r\nindicated that any hole we could dig probably would be filled quickly\r\nby the drift. At dark, about 5 p.m., we all turned in, after a supper\r\nconsisting of a pannikin of hot milk, one of our precious biscuits, and\r\na cold penguin leg each.\r\n\r\nThe gale was stronger than ever on the following morning (April 20). No\r\nwork could be done. Blizzard and snow, snow and blizzard, sudden lulls\r\nand fierce returns. During the lulls we could see on the far horizon to\r\nthe north-east bergs of all shapes and sizes driving along before the\r\ngale, and the sinister appearance of the swift-moving masses made us\r\nthankful indeed that, instead of battling with the storm amid the ice,\r\nwe were required only to face the drift from the glaciers and the\r\ninland heights. The gusts might throw us off our feet, but at least we\r\nfell on solid ground and not on the rocking floes. Two seals came up on\r\nthe beach that day, one of them within ten yards of my tent. So urgent\r\nwas our need of food and blubber that I called all hands and organized\r\na line of beaters instead of simply walking up to the seal and hitting\r\nit on the nose. We were prepared to fall upon this seal _en masse_ if\r\nit attempted to escape. The kill was made with a pick-handle, and in a\r\nfew minutes five days’ food and six days’ fuel were stowed in a place\r\nof safety among the boulders above high-water mark. During this day the\r\ncook, who had worked well on the floe and throughout the boat journey,\r\nsuddenly collapsed. I happened to be at the galley at the moment and\r\nsaw him fall. I pulled him down the slope to his tent and pushed him\r\ninto its shelter with orders to his tent-mates to keep him in his\r\nsleeping-bag until I allowed him to come out or the doctors said he was\r\nfit enough. Then I took out to replace the cook one of the men who had\r\nexpressed a desire to lie down and die. The task of keeping the galley\r\nfire alight was both difficult and strenuous, and it took his thoughts\r\naway from the chances of immediate dissolution. In fact, I found him a\r\nlittle later gravely concerned over the drying of a naturally not\r\nover-clean pair of socks which were hung up in close proximity to our\r\nevening milk. Occupation had brought his thoughts back to the ordinary\r\ncares of life.\r\n\r\nThere was a lull in the bad weather on April 21, and the carpenter\r\nstarted to collect material for the decking of the _James Caird_. He\r\nfitted the mast of the _Stancomb Wills_ fore and aft inside the _James\r\nCaird_ as a hog-back and thus strengthened the keel with the object of\r\npreventing our boat “hogging”—that is, buckling in heavy seas. He had\r\nnot sufficient wood to provide a deck, but by using the sledge-runners\r\nand box-lids he made a framework extending from the forecastle aft to a\r\nwell. It was a patched-up affair, but it provided a base for a canvas\r\ncovering. We had a bolt of canvas frozen stiff, and this material had\r\nto be cut and then thawed out over the blubber-stove, foot by foot, in\r\norder that it might be sewn into the form of a cover. When it had been\r\nnailed and screwed into position it certainly gave an appearance of\r\nsafety to the boat, though I had an uneasy feeling that it bore a\r\nstrong likeness to stage scenery, which may look like a granite wall\r\nand is in fact nothing better than canvas and lath. As events proved,\r\nthe covering served its purpose well. We certainly could not have lived\r\nthrough the voyage without it.\r\n\r\nAnother fierce gale was blowing on April 22, interfering with our\r\npreparations for the voyage. The cooker from No. 5 tent came adrift in\r\na gust, and, although it was chased to the water’s edge, it disappeared\r\nfor good. Blackborrow’s feet were giving him much pain, and McIlroy and\r\nMacklin thought it would be necessary for them to operate soon. They\r\nwere under the impression then that they had no chloroform, but they\r\nfound some subsequently in the medicine-chest after we had left. Some\r\ncases of stores left on a rock off the spit on the day of our arrival\r\nwere retrieved during this day. We were setting aside stores for the\r\nboat journey and choosing the essential equipment from the scanty stock\r\nat our disposal. Two ten-gallon casks had to be filled with water\r\nmelted down from ice collected at the foot of the glacier. This was a\r\nrather slow business. The blubber-stove was kept going all night, and\r\nthe watchmen emptied the water into the casks from the pot in which the\r\nice was melted. A working party started to dig a hole in the snow-slope\r\nabout forty feet above sea-level with the object of providing a site\r\nfor a camp. They made fairly good progress at first, but the snow\r\ndrifted down unceasingly from the inland ice, and in the end the party\r\nhad to give up the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Launching the _James Caird_]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The _Stancomb Wills_]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weather was fine on April 23, and we hurried forward our\r\npreparations. It was on this day I decided finally that the crew for\r\nthe _James Caird_ should consist of Worsley, Crean, McNeish, McCarthy,\r\nVincent, and myself. A storm came on about noon, with driving snow and\r\nheavy squalls. Occasionally the air would clear for a few minutes, and\r\nwe could see a line of pack-ice, five miles out, driving across from\r\nwest to east. This sight increased my anxiety to get away quickly.\r\nWinter was advancing, and soon the pack might close completely round\r\nthe island and stay our departure for days or even for weeks, I did not\r\nthink that ice would remain around Elephant Island continuously during\r\nthe winter, since the strong winds and fast currents would keep it in\r\nmotion. We had noticed ice and bergs, going past at the rate of four or\r\nfive knots. A certain amount of ice was held up about the end of our\r\nspit, but the sea was clear where the boat would have to be launched.\r\n\r\nWorsley, Wild, and I climbed to the summit of the seaward rocks and\r\nexamined the ice from a better vantage-point than the beach offered.\r\nThe belt of pack outside appeared to be sufficiently broken for our\r\npurposes, and I decided that, unless the conditions forbade it, we\r\nwould make a start in the _James Caird_ on the following morning.\r\nObviously the pack might close at any time. This decision made, I spent\r\nthe rest of the day looking over the boat, gear, and stores, and\r\ndiscussing plans with Worsley and Wild.\r\n\r\nOur last night on the solid ground of Elephant Island was cold and\r\nuncomfortable. We turned out at dawn and had breakfast. Then we\r\nlaunched the _Stancomb Wills_ and loaded her with stores, gear, and\r\nballast, which would be transferred to the _James Caird_ when the\r\nheavier boat had been launched. The ballast consisted of bags made from\r\nblankets and filled with sand, making a total weight of about 1000 lbs.\r\nIn addition we had gathered a number of round boulders and about 250\r\nlbs. of ice, which would supplement our two casks of water.\r\n\r\nThe stores taken in the _James Caird_, which would last six men for one\r\nmonth, were as follows:\r\n\r\n30 boxes of matches.\r\n6½ gallons paraffin.\r\n1 tin methylated spirit.\r\n10 boxes of flamers.\r\n1 box of blue lights.\r\n2 Primus stoves with spare parts and prickers.\r\n1 Nansen aluminium cooker.\r\n6 sleeping-bags.\r\nA few spare socks.\r\nA few candles and some blubber-oil in an oil-bag.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Food_:\r\n3 cases sledging rations = 300 rations.\r\n2 cases nut food = 200 ”\r\n2 cases biscuits = 600 biscuits.\r\n1 case lump sugar.\r\n30 packets of Trumilk.\r\n1 tin. of Bovril cubes.\r\n1 tin of Cerebos salt.\r\n36 gallons of water.\r\n250 lbs. of ice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Instruments_:\r\nSextant.\r\nSea-anchor.\r\nBinoculars.\r\nCharts.\r\nPrismatic compass.\r\nAneroid.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe swell was slight when the _Stancomb Wills_ was launched and the\r\nboat got under way without any difficulty; but half an hour later, when\r\nwe were pulling down the _James Caird_, the swell increased suddenly.\r\nApparently the movement of the ice outside had made an opening and\r\nallowed the sea to run in without being blanketed by the line of pack.\r\nThe swell made things difficult. Many of us got wet to the waist while\r\ndragging the boat out—a serious matter in that climate. When the _James\r\nCaird_ was afloat in the surf she nearly capsized among the rocks\r\nbefore we could get her clear, and Vincent and the carpenter, who were\r\non the deck, were thrown into the water. This was really bad luck, for\r\nthe two men would have small chance of drying their clothes after we\r\nhad got under way. Hurley, who had the eye of the professional\r\nphotographer for “incidents,” secured a picture of the upset, and I\r\nfirmly believe that he would have liked the two unfortunate men to\r\nremain in the water until he could get a “snap” at close quarters; but\r\nwe hauled them out immediately, regardless of his feelings.\r\n\r\nThe _James Caird_ was soon clear of the breakers. We used all the\r\navailable ropes as a long painter to prevent her drifting away to the\r\nnorth-east, and then the _Stancomb Wills_ came alongside, transferred\r\nher load, and went back to the shore for more. As she was being beached\r\nthis time the sea took her stern and half filled her with water. She\r\nhad to be turned over and emptied before the return journey could be\r\nmade. Every member of the crew of the _Stancomb Wills_ was wet to the\r\nskin. The water-casks were towed behind the _Stancomb Wills_ on this\r\nsecond journey, and the swell, which was increasing rapidly, drove the\r\nboat on to the rocks, where one of the casks was slightly stove in.\r\nThis accident proved later to be a serious one, since some sea-water\r\nhad entered the cask and the contents were now brackish.\r\n\r\nBy midday the _James Caird_ was ready for the voyage. Vincent and the\r\ncarpenter had secured some dry clothes by exchange with members of the\r\nshore party (I heard afterwards that it was a full fortnight before the\r\nsoaked garments were finally dried), and the boat’s crew was standing\r\nby waiting for the order to cast off. A moderate westerly breeze was\r\nblowing. I went ashore in the _Stancomb Wills_ and had a last word with\r\nWild, who was remaining in full command, with directions as to his\r\ncourse of action in the event of our failure to bring relief, but I\r\npractically left the whole situation and scope of action and decision\r\nto his own judgment, secure in the knowledge that he would act wisely.\r\nI told him that I trusted the party to him and said good-bye to the\r\nmen. Then we pushed off for the last time, and within a few minutes I\r\nwas aboard the _James Caird_. The crew of the _Stancomb Wills_ shook\r\nhands with us as the boats bumped together and offered us the last good\r\nwishes. Then, setting our jib, we cut the painter and moved away to the\r\nnorth-east. The men who were staying behind made a pathetic little\r\ngroup on the beach, with the grim heights of the island behind them and\r\nthe sea seething at their feet, but they waved to us and gave three\r\nhearty cheers. There was hope in their hearts and they trusted us to\r\nbring the help that they needed.\r\n\r\nI had all sails set, and the _James Caird_ quickly dipped the beach and\r\nits line of dark figures. The westerly wind took us rapidly to the line\r\nof pack, and as we entered it I stood up with my arm around the mast,\r\ndirecting the steering, so as to avoid the great lumps of ice that were\r\nflung about in the heave of the sea. The pack thickened and we were\r\nforced to turn almost due east, running before the wind towards a gap I\r\nhad seen in the morning from the high ground. I could not see the gap\r\nnow, but we had come out on its bearing and I was prepared to find that\r\nit had been influenced by the easterly drift. At four o’clock in the\r\nafternoon we found the channel, much narrower than it had seemed in the\r\nmorning but still navigable. Dropping sail, we rowed through without\r\ntouching the ice anywhere, and by 5.30 p.m. we were clear of the pack\r\nwith open water before us. We passed one more piece of ice in the\r\ndarkness an hour later, but the pack lay behind, and with a fair wind\r\nswelling the sails we steered our little craft through the night, our\r\nhopes centred on our distant goal. The swell was very heavy now, and\r\nwhen the time came for our first evening meal we found great difficulty\r\nin keeping the Primus lamp alight and preventing the hoosh splashing\r\nout of the pot. Three men were needed to attend to the cooking, one man\r\nholding the lamp and two men guarding the aluminium cooking-pot, which\r\nhad to be lifted clear of the Primus whenever the movement of the boat\r\nthreatened to cause a disaster. Then the lamp had to be protected from\r\nwater, for sprays were coming over the bows and our flimsy decking was\r\nby no means water-tight. All these operations were conducted in the\r\nconfined space under the decking, where the men lay or knelt and\r\nadjusted themselves as best they could to the angles of our cases and\r\nballast. It was uncomfortable, but we found consolation in the\r\nreflection that without the decking we could not have used the cooker\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nThe tale of the next sixteen days is one of supreme strife amid heaving\r\nwaters. The sub-Antarctic Ocean lived up to its evil winter reputation.\r\nI decided to run north for at least two days while the wind held and so\r\nget into warmer weather before turning to the east and laying a course\r\nfor South Georgia. We took two-hourly spells at the tiller. The men who\r\nwere not on watch crawled into the sodden sleeping-bags and tried to\r\nforget their troubles for a period; but there was no comfort in the\r\nboat. The bags and cases seemed to be alive in the unfailing knack of\r\npresenting their most uncomfortable angles to our rest-seeking bodies.\r\nA man might imagine for a moment that he had found a position of ease,\r\nbut always discovered quickly that some unyielding point was impinging\r\non muscle or bone. The first night aboard the boat was one of acute\r\ndiscomfort for us all, and we were heartily glad when the dawn came and\r\nwe could set about the preparation of a hot breakfast.\r\n\r\nThis record of the voyage to South Georgia is based upon scanty notes\r\nmade day by day. The notes dealt usually with the bare facts of\r\ndistances, positions, and weather, but our memories retained the\r\nincidents of the passing days in a period never to be forgotten. By\r\nrunning north for the first two days I hoped to get warmer weather and\r\nalso to avoid lines of pack that might be extending beyond the main\r\nbody. We needed all the advantage that we could obtain from the higher\r\nlatitude for sailing on the great circle, but we had to be cautious\r\nregarding possible ice-streams. Cramped in our narrow quarters and\r\ncontinually wet by the spray, we suffered severely from cold throughout\r\nthe journey. We fought the seas and the winds and at the same time had\r\na daily struggle to keep ourselves alive. At times we were in dire\r\nperil. Generally we were upheld by the knowledge that we were making\r\nprogress towards the land where we would be, but there were days and\r\nnights when we lay hove to, drifting across the storm-whitened seas and\r\nwatching with eyes interested rather than apprehensive the uprearing\r\nmasses of water, flung to and fro by Nature in the pride of her\r\nstrength. Deep seemed the valleys when we lay between the reeling seas.\r\nHigh were the hills when we perched momentarily on the tops of giant\r\ncombers. Nearly always there were gales. So small was our boat and so\r\ngreat were the seas that often our sail flapped idly in the calm\r\nbetween the crests of two waves. Then we would climb the next slope and\r\ncatch the full fury of the gale where the wool-like whiteness of the\r\nbreaking water surged around us. We had our moments of laughter—rare,\r\nit is true, but hearty enough. Even when cracked lips and swollen\r\nmouths checked the outward and visible signs of amusement we could see\r\na joke of the primitive kind. Man’s sense of humour is always most\r\neasily stirred by the petty misfortunes of his neighbours, and I shall\r\nnever forget Worsley’s efforts on one occasion to place the hot\r\naluminium stand on top of the Primus stove after it had fallen off in\r\nan extra heavy roll. With his frost-bitten fingers he picked it up,\r\ndropped it, picked it up again, and toyed with it gingerly as though it\r\nwere some fragile article of lady’s wear. We laughed, or rather gurgled\r\nwith laughter.\r\n\r\nThe wind came up strong and worked into a gale from the north-west on\r\nthe third day out. We stood away to the east. The increasing seas\r\ndiscovered the weaknesses of our decking. The continuous blows shifted\r\nthe box-lids and sledge-runners so that the canvas sagged down and\r\naccumulated water. Then icy trickles, distinct from the driving sprays,\r\npoured fore and aft into the boat. The nails that the carpenter had\r\nextracted from cases at Elephant Island and used to fasten down the\r\nbattens were too short to make firm the decking. We did what we could\r\nto secure it, but our means were very limited, and the water continued\r\nto enter the boat at a dozen points. Much baling was necessary, and\r\nnothing that we could do prevented our gear from becoming sodden. The\r\nsearching runnels from the canvas were really more unpleasant than the\r\nsudden definite douches of the sprays. Lying under the thwarts during\r\nwatches below, we tried vainly to avoid them. There were no dry places\r\nin the boat, and at last we simply covered our heads with our Burberrys\r\nand endured the all-pervading water. The baling was work for the watch.\r\nReal rest we had none. The perpetual motion of the boat made repose\r\nimpossible; we were cold, sore, and anxious. We moved on hands and\r\nknees in the semi-darkness of the day under the decking. The darkness\r\nwas complete by 6 p.m., and not until 7 a.m. of the following day could\r\nwe see one another under the thwarts. We had a few scraps of candle,\r\nand they were preserved carefully in order that we might have light at\r\nmeal-times. There was one fairly dry spot in the boat, under the solid\r\noriginal decking at the bows, and we managed to protect some of our\r\nbiscuit from the salt water; but I do not think any of us got the taste\r\nof salt out of our mouths during the voyage.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of movement in the boat would have had its humorous side\r\nif it had not involved us in so many aches and pains. We had to crawl\r\nunder the thwarts in order to move along the boat, and our knees\r\nsuffered considerably. When watch turned out it was necessary for me to\r\ndirect each man by name when and where to move, since if all hands had\r\ncrawled about at the same time the result would have been dire\r\nconfusion and many bruises. Then there was the trim of the boat to be\r\nconsidered. The order of the watch was four hours on and four hours\r\noff, three men to the watch. One man had the tiller-ropes, the second\r\nman attended to the sail, and the third baled for all he was worth.\r\nSometimes when the water in the boat had been reduced to reasonable\r\nproportions, our pump could be used. This pump, which Hurley had made\r\nfrom the Flinder’s bar case of our ship’s standard compass, was quite\r\neffective, though its capacity was not large. The man who was attending\r\nthe sail could pump into the big outer cooker, which was lifted and\r\nemptied overboard when filled. We had a device by which the water could\r\ngo direct from the pump into the sea through a hole in the gunwale, but\r\nthis hole had to be blocked at an early stage of the voyage, since we\r\nfound that it admitted water when the boat rolled.\r\n\r\nWhile a new watch was shivering in the wind and spray, the men who had\r\nbeen relieved groped hurriedly among the soaked sleeping-bags and tried\r\nto steal a little of the warmth created by the last occupants; but it\r\nwas not always possible for us to find even this comfort when we went\r\noff watch. The boulders that we had taken aboard for ballast had to be\r\nshifted continually in order to trim the boat and give access to the\r\npump, which became choked with hairs from the moulting sleeping-bags\r\nand finneskoe. The four reindeer-skin sleeping-bags shed their hair\r\nfreely owing to the continuous wetting, and soon became quite bald in\r\nappearance. The moving of the boulders was weary and painful work. We\r\ncame to know every one of the stones by sight and touch, and I have\r\nvivid memories of their angular peculiarities even to-day. They might\r\nhave been of considerable interest as geological specimens to a\r\nscientific man under happier conditions. As ballast they were useful.\r\nAs weights to be moved about in cramped quarters they were simply\r\nappalling. They spared no portion of our poor bodies. Another of our\r\ntroubles, worth mention here, was the chafing of our legs by our wet\r\nclothes, which had not been changed now for seven months. The insides\r\nof our thighs were rubbed raw, and the one tube of Hazeline cream in\r\nour medicine-chest did not go far in alleviating our pain, which was\r\nincreased by the bite of the salt water. We thought at the time that we\r\nnever slept. The fact was that we would doze off uncomfortably, to be\r\naroused quickly by some new ache or another call to effort. My own\r\nshare of the general unpleasantness was accentuated by a finely\r\ndeveloped bout of sciatica. I had become possessor of this originally\r\non the floe several months earlier.\r\n\r\nOur meals were regular in spite of the gales. Attention to this point\r\nwas essential, since the conditions of the voyage made increasing calls\r\nupon our vitality. Breakfast, at 8 a.m., consisted of a pannikin of hot\r\nhoosh made from Bovril sledging ration, two biscuits, and some lumps of\r\nsugar. Lunch came at 1 p.m., and comprised Bovril sledging ration,\r\neaten raw, and a pannikin of hot milk for each man. Tea, at 5 p.m., had\r\nthe same menu. Then during the night we had a hot drink, generally of\r\nmilk. The meals were the bright beacons in those cold and stormy days.\r\nThe glow of warmth and comfort produced by the food and drink made\r\noptimists of us all. We had two tins of Virol, which we were keeping\r\nfor an emergency; but, finding ourselves in need of an oil-lamp to eke\r\nout our supply of candles, we emptied one of the tins in the manner\r\nthat most appealed to us, and fitted it with a wick made by shredding a\r\nbit of canvas. When this lamp was filled with oil it gave a certain\r\namount of light, though it was easily blown out, and was of great\r\nassistance to us at night. We were fairly well off as regarded fuel,\r\nsince we had 6½ gallons of petroleum.\r\n\r\nA severe south-westerly gale on the fourth day out forced us to heave\r\nto. I would have liked to have run before the wind, but the sea was\r\nvery high and the _James Caird_ was in danger of broaching to and\r\nswamping. The delay was vexatious, since up to that time we had been\r\nmaking sixty or seventy miles a day, good going with our limited sail\r\narea. We hove to under double-reefed mainsail and our little jigger,\r\nand waited for the gale to blow itself out. During that afternoon we\r\nsaw bits of wreckage, the remains probably of some unfortunate vessel\r\nthat had failed to weather the strong gales south of Cape Horn. The\r\nweather conditions did not improve, and on the fifth day out the gale\r\nwas so fierce that we were compelled to take in the double-reefed\r\nmainsail and hoist our small jib instead. We put out a sea-anchor to\r\nkeep the _James Caird’s_ head up to the sea. This anchor consisted of a\r\ntriangular canvas bag fastened to the end of the painter and allowed to\r\nstream out from the bows. The boat was high enough to catch the wind,\r\nand, as she drifted to leeward, the drag of the anchor kept her head to\r\nwindward. Thus our boat took most of the seas more or less end on. Even\r\nthen the crests of the waves often would curl right over us and we\r\nshipped a great deal of water, which necessitated unceasing baling and\r\npumping. Looking out abeam, we would see a hollow like a tunnel formed\r\nas the crest of a big wave toppled over on to the swelling body of\r\nwater. A thousand times it appeared as though the _James Caird_ must be\r\nengulfed; but the boat lived. The south-westerly gale had its\r\nbirthplace above the Antarctic Continent, and its freezing breath\r\nlowered the temperature far towards zero. The sprays froze upon the\r\nboat and gave bows, sides, and decking a heavy coat of mail. This\r\naccumulation of ice reduced the buoyancy of the boat, and to that\r\nextent was an added peril; but it possessed a notable advantage from\r\none point of view. The water ceased to drop and trickle from the\r\ncanvas, and the spray came in solely at the well in the after part of\r\nthe boat. We could not allow the load of ice to grow beyond a certain\r\npoint, and in turns we crawled about the decking forward, chipping and\r\npicking at it with the available tools.\r\n\r\nWhen daylight came on the morning of the sixth day out we saw and felt\r\nthat the _James Caird_ had lost her resiliency. She was not rising to\r\nthe oncoming seas. The weight of the ice that had formed in her and\r\nupon her during the night was having its effect, and she was becoming\r\nmore like a log than a boat. The situation called for immediate action.\r\nWe first broke away the spare oars, which were encased in ice and\r\nfrozen to the sides of the boat, and threw them overboard. We retained\r\ntwo oars for use when we got inshore. Two of the fur sleeping-bags went\r\nover the side; they were thoroughly wet, weighing probably 40 lbs.\r\neach, and they had frozen stiff during the night. Three men constituted\r\nthe watch below, and when a man went down it was better to turn into\r\nthe wet bag just vacated by another man than to thaw out a frozen bag\r\nwith the heat of his unfortunate body. We now had four bags, three in\r\nuse and one for emergency use in case a member of the party should\r\nbreak down permanently. The reduction of weight relieved the boat to\r\nsome extent, and vigorous chipping and scraping did more. We had to be\r\nvery careful not to put axe or knife through the frozen canvas of the\r\ndecking as we crawled over it, but gradually we got rid of a lot of\r\nice. The _James Caird_ lifted to the endless waves as though she lived\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAbout 11 a.m. the boat suddenly fell off into the trough of the sea.\r\nThe painter had parted and the sea-anchor had gone. This was serious.\r\nThe _James Caird_ went away to leeward, and we had no chance at all of\r\nrecovering the anchor and our valuable rope, which had been our only\r\nmeans of keeping the boat’s head up to the seas without the risk of\r\nhoisting sail in a gale. Now we had to set the sail and trust to its\r\nholding. While the _James Caird_ rolled heavily in the trough, we beat\r\nthe frozen canvas until the bulk of the ice had cracked off it and then\r\nhoisted it. The frozen gear worked protestingly, but after a struggle\r\nour little craft came up to the wind again, and we breathed more\r\nfreely. Skin frost-bites were troubling us, and we had developed large\r\nblisters on our fingers and hands. I shall always carry the scar of one\r\nof these frost-bites on my left hand, which became badly inflamed after\r\nthe skin had burst and the cold had bitten deeply.\r\n\r\nWe held the boat up to the gale during that day, enduring as best we\r\ncould discomforts that amounted to pain. The boat tossed interminably\r\non the big waves under grey, threatening skies. Our thoughts did not\r\nembrace much more than the necessities of the hour. Every surge of the\r\nsea was an enemy to be watched and circumvented. We ate our scanty\r\nmeals, treated our frost-bites, and hoped for the improved conditions\r\nthat the morrow might bring. Night fell early, and in the lagging hours\r\nof darkness we were cheered by a change for the better in the weather.\r\nThe wind dropped, the snow-squalls became less frequent, and the sea\r\nmoderated. When the morning of the seventh day dawned there was not\r\nmuch wind. We shook the reef out of the sail and laid our course once\r\nmore for South Georgia. The sun came out bright and clear, and\r\npresently Worsley got a snap for longitude. We hoped that the sky would\r\nremain clear until noon, so that we could get the latitude. We had been\r\nsix days out without an observation, and our dead reckoning naturally\r\nwas uncertain. The boat must have presented a strange appearance that\r\nmorning. All hands basked in the sun. We hung our sleeping-bags to the\r\nmast and spread our socks and other gear all over the deck. Some of the\r\nice had melted off the _James Caird_ in the early morning after the\r\ngale began to slacken; and dry patches were appearing in the decking.\r\nPorpoises came blowing round the boat, and Cape pigeons wheeled and\r\nswooped within a few feet of us. These little black-and-white birds\r\nhave an air of friendliness that is not possessed by the great circling\r\nalbatross. They had looked grey against the swaying sea during the\r\nstorm as they darted about over our heads and uttered their plaintive\r\ncries. The albatrosses, of the black or sooty variety, had watched with\r\nhard, bright eyes, and seemed to have a quite impersonal interest in\r\nour struggle to keep afloat amid the battering seas. In addition to the\r\nCape pigeons an occasional stormy petrel flashed overhead. Then there\r\nwas a small bird, unknown to me, that appeared always to be in a fussy,\r\nbustling state, quite out of keeping with the surroundings. It\r\nirritated me. It had practically no tail, and it flitted about vaguely\r\nas though in search of the lost member. I used to find myself wishing\r\nit would find its tail and have done with the silly fluttering.\r\n\r\nWe revelled in the warmth of the sun that day. Life was not so bad,\r\nafter all. We felt we were well on our way. Our gear was drying, and we\r\ncould have a hot meal in comparative comfort. The swell was still\r\nheavy, but it was not breaking and the boat rode easily. At noon\r\nWorsley balanced himself on the gunwale and clung with one hand to the\r\nstay of the mainmast while he got a snap of the sun. The result was\r\nmore than encouraging. We had done over 380 miles and were getting on\r\nfor half-way to South Georgia. It looked as though we were going to get\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nThe wind freshened to a good stiff breeze during the afternoon, and the\r\n_James Caird_ made satisfactory progress. I had not realized until the\r\nsunlight came how small our boat really was. There was some influence\r\nin the light and warmth, some hint of happier days, that made us revive\r\nmemories of other voyages, when we had stout decks beneath our feet,\r\nunlimited food at our command, and pleasant cabins for our ease. Now we\r\nclung to a battered little boat, “alone, alone—all, all alone; alone on\r\na wide, wide sea.” So low in the water were we that each succeeding\r\nswell cut off our view of the sky-line. We were a tiny speck in the\r\nvast vista of the sea—the ocean that is open to all and merciful to\r\nnone, that threatens even when it seems to yield, and that is pitiless\r\nalways to weakness. For a moment the consciousness of the forces\r\narrayed against us would be almost overwhelming. Then hope and\r\nconfidence would rise again as our boat rose to a wave and tossed aside\r\nthe crest in a sparkling shower like the play of prismatic colours at\r\nthe foot of a waterfall. My double-barrelled gun and some cartridges\r\nhad been stowed aboard the boat as an emergency precaution against a\r\nshortage of food, but we were not disposed to destroy our little\r\nneighbours, the Cape pigeons, even for the sake of fresh meat. We might\r\nhave shot an albatross, but the wandering king of the ocean aroused in\r\nus something of the feeling that inspired, too late, the Ancient\r\nMariner. So the gun remained among the stores and sleeping-bags in the\r\nnarrow quarters beneath our leaking deck, and the birds followed us\r\nunmolested.\r\n\r\nThe eighth, ninth, and tenth days of the voyage had few features worthy\r\nof special note. The wind blew hard during those days, and the strain\r\nof navigating the boat was unceasing, but always we made some advance\r\ntowards our goal. No bergs showed on our horizon, and we knew that we\r\nwere clear of the ice-fields. Each day brought its little round of\r\ntroubles, but also compensation in the form of food and growing hope.\r\nWe felt that we were going to succeed. The odds against us had been\r\ngreat, but we were winning through. We still suffered severely from the\r\ncold, for, though the temperature was rising, our vitality was\r\ndeclining owing to shortage of food, exposure, and the necessity of\r\nmaintaining our cramped positions day and night. I found that it was\r\nnow absolutely necessary to prepare hot milk for all hands during the\r\nnight, in order to sustain life till dawn. This meant lighting the\r\nPrimus lamp in the darkness and involved an increased drain on our\r\nsmall store of matches. It was the rule that one match must serve when\r\nthe Primus was being lit. We had no lamp for the compass and during the\r\nearly days of the voyage we would strike a match when the steersman\r\nwanted to see the course at night; but later the necessity for strict\r\neconomy impressed itself upon us, and the practice of striking matches\r\nat night was stopped. We had one water-tight tin of matches. I had\r\nstowed away in a pocket, in readiness for a sunny day, a lens from one\r\nof the telescopes, but this was of no use during the voyage. The sun\r\nseldom shone upon us. The glass of the compass got broken one night,\r\nand we contrived to mend it with adhesive tape from the medicine-chest.\r\nOne of the memories that comes to me from those days is of Crean\r\nsinging at the tiller. He always sang while he was steering, and nobody\r\never discovered what the song was. It was devoid of tune and as\r\nmonotonous as the chanting of a Buddhist monk at his prayers; yet\r\nsomehow it was cheerful. In moments of inspiration Crean would attempt\r\n“The Wearing of the Green.”\r\n\r\nOn the tenth night Worsley could not straighten his body after his\r\nspell at the tiller. He was thoroughly cramped, and we had to drag him\r\nbeneath the decking and massage him before he could unbend himself and\r\nget into a sleeping-bag. A hard north-westerly gale came up on the\r\neleventh day (May 5) and shifted to the south-west in the late\r\nafternoon. The sky was overcast and occasional snow-squalls added to\r\nthe discomfort produced by a tremendous cross-sea—the worst, I thought,\r\nthat we had experienced. At midnight I was at the tiller and suddenly\r\nnoticed a line of clear sky between the south and south-west. I called\r\nto the other men that the sky was clearing, and then a moment later I\r\nrealized that what I had seen was not a rift in the clouds but the\r\nwhite crest of an enormous wave. During twenty-six years’ experience of\r\nthe ocean in all its moods I had not encountered a wave so gigantic. It\r\nwas a mighty upheaval of the ocean, a thing quite apart from the big\r\nwhite-capped seas that had been our tireless enemies for many days. I\r\nshouted, “For God’s sake, hold on! It’s got us!” Then came a moment of\r\nsuspense that seemed drawn out into hours. White surged the foam of the\r\nbreaking sea around us. We felt our boat lifted and flung forward like\r\na cork in breaking surf. We were in a seething chaos of tortured water;\r\nbut somehow the boat lived through it, half-full of water, sagging to\r\nthe dead weight and shuddering under the blow. We baled with the energy\r\nof men fighting for life, flinging the water over the sides with every\r\nreceptacle that came to our hands, and after ten minutes of uncertainty\r\nwe felt the boat renew her life beneath us. She floated again and\r\nceased to lurch drunkenly as though dazed by the attack of the sea.\r\nEarnestly we hoped that never again would we encounter such a wave.\r\n\r\nThe conditions in the boat, uncomfortable before, had been made worse\r\nby the deluge of water. All our gear was thoroughly wet again. Our\r\ncooking-stove had been floating about in the bottom of the boat, and\r\nportions of our last hoosh seemed to have permeated everything. Not\r\nuntil 3 a.m., when we were all chilled almost to the limit of\r\nendurance, did we manage to get the stove alight and make ourselves hot\r\ndrinks. The carpenter was suffering particularly, but he showed grit\r\nand spirit. Vincent had for the past week ceased to be an active member\r\nof the crew, and I could not easily account for his collapse.\r\nPhysically he was one of the strongest men in the boat. He was a young\r\nman, he had served on North Sea trawlers, and he should have been able\r\nto bear hardships better than McCarthy, who, not so strong, was always\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nThe weather was better on the following day (May 6), and we got a\r\nglimpse of the sun. Worsley’s observation showed that we were not more\r\nthan a hundred miles from the north-west corner of South Georgia. Two\r\nmore days with a favourable wind and we would sight the promised land.\r\nI hoped that there would be no delay, for our supply of water was\r\nrunning very low. The hot drink at night was essential, but I decided\r\nthat the daily allowance of water must be cut down to half a pint per\r\nman. The lumps of ice we had taken aboard had gone long ago. We were\r\ndependent upon the water we had brought from Elephant Island, and our\r\nthirst was increased by the fact that we were now using the brackish\r\nwater in the breaker that had been slightly stove in in the surf when\r\nthe boat was being loaded. Some sea-water had entered at that time.\r\nThirst took possession of us. I dared not permit the allowance of water\r\nto be increased since an unfavourable wind might drive us away from the\r\nisland and lengthen our voyage by many days. Lack of water is always\r\nthe most severe privation that men can be condemned to endure, and we\r\nfound, as during our earlier boat voyage, that the salt water in our\r\nclothing and the salt spray that lashed our faces made our thirst grow\r\nquickly to a burning pain. I had to be very firm in refusing to allow\r\nany one to anticipate the morrow’s allowance, which I was sometimes\r\nbegged to do. We did the necessary work dully and hoped for the land. I\r\nhad altered the course to the east so as to make sure of our striking\r\nthe island, which would have been impossible to regain if we had run\r\npast the northern end. The course was laid on our scrap of chart for a\r\npoint some thirty miles down the coast. That day and the following day\r\npassed for us in a sort of nightmare. Our mouths were dry and our\r\ntongues were swollen. The wind was still strong and the heavy sea\r\nforced us to navigate carefully, but any thought of our peril from the\r\nwaves was buried beneath the consciousness of our raging thirst. The\r\nbright moments were those when we each received our one mug of hot milk\r\nduring the long, bitter watches of the night. Things were bad for us in\r\nthose days, but the end was coming. The morning of May 8 broke thick\r\nand stormy, with squalls from the north-west. We searched the waters\r\nahead for a sign of land, and though we could see nothing more than had\r\nmet our eyes for many days, we were cheered by a sense that the goal\r\nwas near at hand. About ten o’clock that morning we passed a little bit\r\nof kelp, a glad signal of the proximity of land. An hour later we saw\r\ntwo shags sitting on a big mass of kelp, and knew then that we must be\r\nwithin ten or fifteen miles of the shore. These birds are as sure an\r\nindication of the proximity of land as a lighthouse is, for they never\r\nventure far to sea. We gazed ahead with increasing eagerness, and at\r\n12.30 p.m., through a rift in the clouds, McCarthy caught a glimpse of\r\nthe black cliffs of South Georgia, just fourteen days after our\r\ndeparture from Elephant Island. It was a glad moment. Thirst-ridden,\r\nchilled, and weak as we were, happiness irradiated us. The job was\r\nnearly done.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In Sight of our Goal: Nearing South Georgia]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Landing on South Georgia]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe stood in towards the shore to look for a landing-place, and\r\npresently we could see the green tussock-grass on the ledges above the\r\nsurf-beaten rocks. Ahead of us and to the south, blind rollers showed\r\nthe presence of uncharted reefs along the coast. Here and there the\r\nhungry rocks were close to the surface, and over them the great waves\r\nbroke, swirling viciously and spouting thirty and forty feet into the\r\nair. The rocky coast appeared to descend sheer to the sea. Our need of\r\nwater and rest was well-nigh desperate, but to have attempted a landing\r\nat that time would have been suicidal. Night was drawing near, and the\r\nweather indications were not favourable. There was nothing for it but\r\nto haul off till the following morning, so we stood away on the\r\nstarboard tack until we had made what appeared to be a safe offing.\r\nThen we hove to in the high westerly swell. The hours passed slowly as\r\nwe waited the dawn, which would herald, we fondly hoped, the last stage\r\nof our journey. Our thirst was a torment and we could scarcely touch\r\nour food; the cold seemed to strike right through our weakened bodies.\r\nAt 5 a.m. the wind shifted to the north-west and quickly increased to\r\none of the worst hurricanes any of us had ever experienced. A great\r\ncross-sea was running and the wind simply shrieked as it tore the tops\r\noff the waves and converted the whole seascape into a haze of driving\r\nspray. Down into valleys, up to tossing heights, straining until her\r\nseams opened, swung our little boat, brave still but labouring heavily.\r\nWe knew that the wind and set of the sea was driving us ashore, but we\r\ncould do nothing. The dawn showed us a storm-torn ocean, and the\r\nmorning passed without bringing us a sight of the land; but at 1 p.m.,\r\nthrough a rift in the flying mists, we got a glimpse of the huge crags\r\nof the island and realized that our position had become desperate. We\r\nwere on a dead lee shore, and we could gauge our approach to the unseen\r\ncliffs by the roar of the breakers against the sheer walls of rock. I\r\nordered the double-reefed mainsail to be set in the hope that we might\r\nclaw off, and this attempt increased the strain upon the boat. The\r\n_James Caird_ was bumping heavily, and the water was pouring in\r\neverywhere. Our thirst was forgotten in the realization of our imminent\r\ndanger, as we baled unceasingly, and adjusted our weights from time to\r\ntime; occasional glimpses showed that the shore was nearer. I knew that\r\nAnnewkow Island lay to the south of us, but our small and badly marked\r\nchart showed uncertain reefs in the passage between the island and the\r\nmainland, and I dared not trust it, though as a last resort we could\r\ntry to lie under the lee of the island. The afternoon wore away as we\r\nedged down the coast, with the thunder of the breakers in our ears. The\r\napproach of evening found us still some distance from Annewkow Island,\r\nand, dimly in the twilight, we could see a snow-capped mountain looming\r\nabove us. The chance of surviving the night, with the driving gale and\r\nthe implacable sea forcing us on to the lee shore, seemed small. I\r\nthink most of us had a feeling that the end was very near. Just after 6\r\np.m., in the dark, as the boat was in the yeasty backwash from the seas\r\nflung from this iron-bound coast, then, just when things looked their\r\nworst, they changed for the best. I have marvelled often at the thin\r\nline that divides success from failure and the sudden turn that leads\r\nfrom apparently certain disaster to comparative safety. The wind\r\nsuddenly shifted, and we were free once more to make an offing. Almost\r\nas soon as the gale eased, the pin that locked the mast to the thwart\r\nfell out. It must have been on the point of doing this throughout the\r\nhurricane, and if it had gone nothing could have saved us; the mast\r\nwould have snapped like a carrot. Our backstays had carried away once\r\nbefore when iced up and were not too strongly fastened now. We were\r\nthankful indeed for the mercy that had held that pin in its place\r\nthroughout the hurricane.\r\n\r\nWe stood off shore again, tired almost to the point of apathy. Our\r\nwater had long been finished. The last was about a pint of hairy\r\nliquid, which we strained through a bit of gauze from the\r\nmedicine-chest. The pangs of thirst attacked us with redoubled\r\nintensity, and I felt that we must make a landing on the following day\r\nat almost any hazard. The night wore on. We were very tired. We longed\r\nfor day. When at last the dawn came on the morning of May 10 there was\r\npractically no wind, but a high cross-sea was running. We made slow\r\nprogress towards the shore. About 8 a.m. the wind backed to the\r\nnorth-west and threatened another blow. We had sighted in the meantime\r\na big indentation which I thought must be King Haakon Bay, and I\r\ndecided that we must land there. We set the bows of the boat towards\r\nthe bay and ran before the freshening gale. Soon we had angry reefs on\r\neither side. Great glaciers came down to the sea and offered no\r\nlanding-place. The sea spouted on the reefs and thundered against the\r\nshore. About noon we sighted a line of jagged reef, like blackened\r\nteeth, that seemed to bar the entrance to the bay. Inside,\r\ncomparatively smooth water stretched eight or nine miles to the head of\r\nthe bay. A gap in the reef appeared, and we made for it. But the fates\r\nhad another rebuff for us. The wind shifted and blew from the east\r\nright out of the bay. We could see the way through the reef, but we\r\ncould not approach it directly. That afternoon we bore up, tacking five\r\ntimes in the strong wind. The last tack enabled us to get through, and\r\nat last we were in the wide mouth of the bay. Dusk was approaching. A\r\nsmall cove, with a boulder-strewn beach guarded by a reef, made a break\r\nin the cliffs on the south side of the bay, and we turned in that\r\ndirection. I stood in the bows directing the steering as we ran through\r\nthe kelp and made the passage of the reef. The entrance was so narrow\r\nthat we had to take in the oars, and the swell was piling itself right\r\nover the reef into the cove; but in a minute or two we were inside, and\r\nin the gathering darkness the _James Caird_ ran in on a swell and\r\ntouched the beach. I sprang ashore with the short painter and held on\r\nwhen the boat went out with the backward surge. When the _James Caird_\r\ncame in again three of the men got ashore, and they held the painter\r\nwhile I climbed some rocks with another line. A slip on the wet rocks\r\ntwenty feet up nearly closed my part of the story just at the moment\r\nwhen we were achieving safety. A jagged piece of rock held me and at\r\nthe same time bruised me sorely. However, I made fast the line, and in\r\na few minutes we were all safe on the beach, with the boat floating in\r\nthe surging water just off the shore. We heard a gurgling sound that\r\nwas sweet music in our ears, and, peering around, found a stream of\r\nfresh water almost at our feet. A moment later we were down on our\r\nknees drinking the pure, ice-cold water in long draughts that put new\r\nlife into us. It was a splendid moment.\r\n\r\nThe next thing was to get the stores and ballast out of the boat, in\r\norder that we might secure her for the night. We carried the stores and\r\ngear above high-water mark and threw out the bags of sand and the\r\nboulders that we knew so well. Then we attempted to pull the empty boat\r\nup the beach, and discovered by this effort how weak we had become. Our\r\nunited strength was not sufficient to get the _James Caird_ clear of\r\nthe water. Time after time we pulled together, but without avail. I saw\r\nthat it would be necessary to have food and rest before we beached the\r\nboat. We made fast a line to a heavy boulder and set a watch to fend\r\nthe _James Caird_ off the rocks of the beach. Then I sent Crean round\r\nto the left side of the cove, about thirty yards away, where I had\r\nnoticed a little cave as we were running in. He could not see much in\r\nthe darkness, but reported that the place certainly promised some\r\nshelter. We carried the sleeping-bags round and found a mere hollow in\r\nthe rock-face, with a shingle floor sloping at a steep angle to the\r\nsea. There we prepared a hot meal, and when the food was finished I\r\nordered the men to turn in. The time was now about 8 p.m., and I took\r\nthe first watch beside the _James Caird_, which was still afloat in the\r\ntossing water just off the beach.\r\n\r\nFending the _James Caird_ off the rocks in the darkness was awkward\r\nwork. The boat would have bumped dangerously if allowed to ride in with\r\nthe waves that drove into the cove. I found a flat rock for my feet,\r\nwhich were in a bad way owing to cold, wetness, and lack of exercise in\r\nthe boat, and during the next few hours I laboured to keep the _James\r\nCaird_ clear of the beach. Occasionally I had to rush into the seething\r\nwater. Then, as a wave receded, I let the boat out on the alpine rope\r\nso as to avoid a sudden jerk. The heavy painter had been lost when the\r\nsea-anchor went adrift. The _James Caird_ could be seen but dimly in\r\nthe cove, where the high black cliffs made the darkness almost\r\ncomplete, and the strain upon one’s attention was great. After several\r\nhours had passed I found that my desire for sleep was becoming\r\nirresistible, and at 1 a.m. I called Crean. I could hear him groaning\r\nas he stumbled over the sharp rocks on his way down the beach. While he\r\nwas taking charge of the _James Caird_ she got adrift, and we had some\r\nanxious moments. Fortunately, she went across towards the cave and we\r\nsecured her, unharmed. The loss or destruction of the boat at this\r\nstage would have been a very serious matter, since we probably would\r\nhave found it impossible to leave the cove except by sea. The cliffs\r\nand glaciers around offered no practicable path towards the head of the\r\nbay. I arranged for one-hour watches during the remainder of the night\r\nand then took Crean’s place among the sleeping men and got some sleep\r\nbefore the dawn came.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Cave Cove on South Georgia]]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Surroundings of King Haakon Bay]]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sea went down in the early hours of the morning (May 11), and after\r\nsunrise we were able to set about getting the boat ashore, first\r\nbracing ourselves for the task with another meal. We were all weak\r\nstill. We cut off the topsides and took out all the movable gear. Then\r\nwe waited for Byron’s “great ninth wave,” and when it lifted the _James\r\nCaird_ in we held her and, by dint of great exertion, worked her round\r\nbroadside to the sea. Inch by inch we dragged her up until we reached\r\nthe fringe of the tussock-grass and knew that the boat was above\r\nhigh-water mark. The rise of the tide was about five feet, and at\r\nspring tide the water must have reached almost to the edge of the\r\ntussock-grass. The completion of this job removed our immediate\r\nanxieties, and we were free to examine our surroundings and plan the\r\nnext move. The day was bright and clear.\r\n\r\nKing Haakon Bay is an eight-mile sound penetrating the coast of South\r\nGeorgia in an easterly direction. We had noticed that the northern and\r\nsouthern sides of the sound were formed by steep mountain-ranges, their\r\nflanks furrowed by mighty glaciers, the outlets of the great ice-sheet\r\nof the interior. It was obvious that these glaciers and the precipitous\r\nslopes of the mountains barred our way inland from the cove. We must\r\nsail to the head of the sound. Swirling clouds and mist-wreaths had\r\nobscured our view of the sound when we were entering, but glimpses of\r\nsnow-slopes had given us hope that an overland journey could be begun\r\nfrom that point. A few patches of very rough, tussocky land, dotted\r\nwith little tarns, lay between the glaciers along the foot of the\r\nmountains, which were heavily scarred with scree-slopes. Several\r\nmagnificent peaks and crags gazed out across their snowy domains to the\r\nsparkling waters of the sound.\r\n\r\nOur cove lay a little inside the southern headland of King Haakon Bay.\r\nA narrow break in the cliffs, which were about a hundred feet high at\r\nthis point, formed the entrance to the cove. The cliffs continued\r\ninside the cove on each side and merged into a hill which descended at\r\na steep slope to the boulder beach. The slope, which carried\r\ntussock-grass, was not continuous. It eased at two points into little\r\npeaty swamp terraces dotted with frozen pools and drained by two small\r\nstreams. Our cave was a recess in the cliff on the left-hand end of the\r\nbeach. The rocky face of the cliff was undercut at this point, and the\r\nshingle thrown up by the waves formed a steep slope, which we reduced\r\nto about one in six by scraping the stones away from the inside. Later\r\nwe strewed the rough floor with the dead, nearly dry underleaves of the\r\ntussock-grass, so as to form a slightly soft bed for our sleeping-bags.\r\nWater had trickled down the face of the cliff and formed long icicles,\r\nwhich hung down in front of the cave to the length of about fifteen\r\nfeet. These icicles provided shelter, and when we had spread our sails\r\nbelow them, with the assistance of oars, we had quarters that, in the\r\ncircumstances, had to be regarded as reasonably comfortable. The camp\r\nat least was dry, and we moved our gear there with confidence. We built\r\na fireplace and arranged our sleeping-bags and blankets around it. The\r\ncave was about 8 ft. deep and 12 ft. wide at the entrance.\r\n\r\nWhile the camp was being arranged Crean and I climbed the tussock slope\r\nbehind the beach and reached the top of a headland overlooking the\r\nsound. There we found the nests of albatrosses, and, much to our\r\ndelight, the nests contained young birds. The fledgelings were fat and\r\nlusty, and we had no hesitation about deciding that they were destined\r\nto die at an early age. Our most pressing anxiety at this stage was a\r\nshortage of fuel for the cooker. We had rations for ten more days, and\r\nwe knew now that we could get birds for food; but if we were to have\r\nhot meals we must secure fuel. The store of petroleum carried in the\r\nboat was running very low, and it seemed necessary to keep some\r\nquantity for use on the overland journey that lay ahead of us. A\r\nsea-elephant or a seal would have provided fuel as well as food, but we\r\ncould see none in the neighbourhood. During the morning we started a\r\nfire in the cave with wood from the top-sides of the boat, and though\r\nthe dense smoke from the damp sticks inflamed our tired eyes, the\r\nwarmth and the prospect of hot food were ample compensation. Crean was\r\ncook that day, and I suggested to him that he should wear his goggles,\r\nwhich he happened to have brought with him. The goggles helped him a\r\ngreat deal as he bent over the fire and tended the stew. And what a\r\nstew it was! The young albatrosses weighed about fourteen pounds each\r\nfresh killed, and we estimated that they weighed at least six pounds\r\neach when cleaned and dressed for the pot. Four birds went into the pot\r\nfor six men, with a Bovril ration for thickening. The flesh was white\r\nand succulent, and the bones, not fully formed, almost melted in our\r\nmouths. That was a memorable meal. When we had eaten our fill, we dried\r\nour tobacco in the embers of the fire and smoked contentedly. We made\r\nan attempt to dry our clothes, which were soaked with salt water, but\r\ndid not meet with much success. We could not afford to have a fire\r\nexcept for cooking purposes until blubber or driftwood had come our\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Plan of Sleeping Berths in Cave]]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe final stage of the journey had still to be attempted. I realized\r\nthat the condition of the party generally, and particularly of McNeish\r\nand Vincent, would prevent us putting to sea again except under\r\npressure of dire necessity. Our boat, moreover, had been weakened by\r\nthe cutting away of the topsides, and I doubted if we could weather the\r\nisland. We were still 150 miles away from Stromness whaling-station by\r\nsea. The alternative was to attempt the crossing of the island. If we\r\ncould not get over, then we must try to secure enough food and fuel to\r\nkeep us alive through the winter, but this possibility was scarcely\r\nthinkable. Over on Elephant Island twenty-two men were waiting for the\r\nrelief that we alone could secure for them. Their plight was worse than\r\nours. We must push on somehow. Several days must elapse before our\r\nstrength would be sufficiently recovered to allow us to row or sail the\r\nlast nine miles up to the head of the bay. In the meantime we could\r\nmake what preparations were possible and dry our clothes by taking\r\nadvantage of every scrap of heat from the fires we lit for the cooking\r\nof our meals. We turned in early that night, and I remember that I\r\ndreamed of the great wave and aroused my companions with a shout of\r\nwarning as I saw with half-awakened eyes the towering cliff on the\r\nopposite side of the cove. Shortly before midnight a gale sprang up\r\nsuddenly from the north-east with rain and sleet showers. It brought\r\nquantities of glacier-ice into the cove, and by 2 a.m. (May 12) our\r\nlittle harbour was filled with ice, which surged to and fro in the\r\nswell and pushed its way on to the beach. We had solid rock beneath our\r\nfeet and could watch without anxiety. When daylight came rain was\r\nfalling heavily, and the temperature was the highest we had experienced\r\nfor many months. The icicles overhanging our cave were melting down in\r\nstreams and we had to move smartly when passing in and out lest we\r\nshould be struck by falling lumps. A fragment weighing fifteen or\r\ntwenty pounds crashed down while we were having breakfast. We found\r\nthat a big hole had been burned in the bottom of Worsley’s reindeer\r\nsleeping-bag during the night. Worsley had been awakened by a burning\r\nsensation in his feet, and had asked the men near him if his bag was\r\nall right; they looked and could see nothing wrong. We were all\r\nsuperficially frostbitten about the feet, and this condition caused the\r\nextremities to burn painfully, while at the same time sensation was\r\nlost in the skin. Worsley thought that the uncomfortable heat of his\r\nfeet was due to the frost-bites, and he stayed in his bag and presently\r\nwent to sleep again. He discovered when he turned out in the morning\r\nthat the tussock-grass which we had laid on the floor of the cave had\r\nsmouldered outwards from the fire and had actually burned a large hole\r\nin the bag beneath his feet. Fortunately, his feet were not harmed.\r\n\r\nOur party spent a quiet day, attending to clothing and gear, checking\r\nstores, eating and resting. Some more of the young albatrosses made a\r\nnoble end in our pot. The birds were nesting on a small plateau above\r\nthe right-hand end of our beach. We had previously discovered that when\r\nwe were landing from the boat on the night of May 10 we had lost the\r\nrudder. The _James Caird_ had been bumping heavily astern as we were\r\nscrambling ashore, and evidently the rudder was then knocked off. A\r\ncareful search of the beach and the rocks within our reach failed to\r\nreveal the missing article. This was a serious loss, even if the voyage\r\nto the head of the sound could be made in good weather. At dusk the ice\r\nin the cove was rearing and crashing on the beach. It had forced up a\r\nridge of stones close to where the _James Caird_ lay at the edge of the\r\ntussock-grass. Some pieces of ice were driven right up to the canvas\r\nwall at the front of our cave. Fragments lodged within two feet of\r\nVincent, who had the lowest sleeping-place, and within four feet of our\r\nfire. Crean and McCarthy had brought down six more of the young\r\nalbatrosses in the afternoon, so we were well supplied with fresh food.\r\nThe air temperature that night probably was not lower than 38° or 40°\r\nFahr., and we were rendered uncomfortable in our cramped sleeping\r\nquarters by the unaccustomed warmth. Our feelings towards our\r\nneighbours underwent a change. When the temperature was below 20° Fahr,\r\nwe could not get too close to one another—every man wanted to cuddle\r\nagainst his neighbour; but let the temperature rise a few degrees and\r\nthe warmth of another man’s body ceased to be a blessing. The ice and\r\nthe waves had a voice of menace that night, but I heard it only in my\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nThe bay was still filled with ice on the morning of Saturday, May 13,\r\nbut the tide took it all away in the afternoon. Then a strange thing\r\nhappened. The rudder, with all the broad Atlantic to sail in and the\r\ncoasts of two continents to search for a resting-place, came bobbing\r\nback into our cove. With anxious eyes we watched it as it advanced,\r\nreceded again, and then advanced once more under the capricious\r\ninfluence of wind and wave. Nearer and nearer it came as we waited on\r\nthe shore, oars in hand, and at last we were able to seize it. Surely a\r\nremarkable salvage! The day was bright and clear; our clothes were\r\ndrying and our strength was returning. Running water made a musical\r\nsound down the tussock slope and among the boulders. We carried our\r\nblankets up the hill and tried to dry them in the breeze 300 ft. above\r\nsea-level. In the afternoon we began to prepare the _James Caird_ for\r\nthe journey to the head of King Haakon Bay. A noon observation on this\r\nday gave our latitude as 54° 10´ 47´´ S., but according to the German\r\nchart the position should have been 54° 12´ S. Probably Worsley’s\r\nobservation was the more accurate. We were able to keep the fire alight\r\nuntil we went to sleep that night, for while climbing the rocks above\r\nthe cove I had seen at the foot of a cliff a broken spar, which had\r\nbeen thrown up by the waves. We could reach this spar by climbing down\r\nthe cliff, and with a reserve supply of fuel thus in sight we could\r\nafford to burn the fragments of the _James Caird’s_ topsides more\r\nfreely.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning of this day (May 13) Worsley and I tramped across\r\nthe hills in a north-easterly direction with the object of getting a\r\nview of the sound and possibly gathering some information that would be\r\nuseful to us in the next stage of our journey. It was exhausting work,\r\nbut after covering about 2½ miles in two hours, we were able to look\r\neast, up the bay. We could not see very much of the country that we\r\nwould have to cross in order to reach the whaling-station on the other\r\nside of the island. We had passed several brooks and frozen tarns, and\r\nat a point where we had to take to the beach on the shore of the sound\r\nwe found some wreckage—an 18-ft. pine-spar (probably part of a ship’s\r\ntopmast), several pieces of timber, and a little model of a ship’s\r\nhull, evidently a child’s toy. We wondered what tragedy that pitiful\r\nlittle plaything indicated. We encountered also some gentoo penguins\r\nand a young sea-elephant, which Worsley killed.\r\n\r\nWhen we got back to the cave at 3 p.m., tired, hungry, but rather\r\npleased with ourselves, we found a splendid meal of stewed albatross\r\nchicken waiting for us. We had carried a quantity of blubber and the\r\nsea-elephant’s liver in our blouses, and we produced our treasures as a\r\nsurprise for the men. Rough climbing on the way back to camp had nearly\r\npersuaded us to throw the stuff away, but we had held on (regardless of\r\nthe condition of our already sorely tried clothing), and had our reward\r\nat the camp. The long bay had been a magnificent sight, even to eyes\r\nthat had dwelt on grandeur long enough and were hungry for the simple,\r\nfamiliar things of everyday life. Its green-blue waters were being\r\nbeaten to fury by the north-westerly gale. The mountains, “stern peaks\r\nthat dared the stars,” peered through the mists, and between them huge\r\nglaciers poured down from the great ice-slopes and fields that lay\r\nbehind. We counted twelve glaciers and heard every few minutes the\r\nreverberating roar caused by masses of ice calving from the parent\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nOn May 14 we made our preparations for an early start on the following\r\nday if the weather held fair. We expected to be able to pick up the\r\nremains of the sea-elephant on our way up the sound. All hands were\r\nrecovering from the chafing caused by our wet clothes during the boat\r\njourney. The insides of our legs had suffered severely, and for some\r\ntime after landing in the cove we found movement extremely\r\nuncomfortable. We paid our last visit to the nests of the albatrosses,\r\nwhich were situated on a little undulating plateau above the cave amid\r\ntussocks, snow-patches, and little frozen tarns. Each nest consisted of\r\na mound over a foot high of tussock-grass, roots, and a little earth.\r\nThe albatross lays one egg and very rarely two. The chicks, which are\r\nhatched in January, are fed on the nest by the parent birds for almost\r\nseven months before they take to the sea and fend for themselves. Up to\r\nfour months of age the chicks are beautiful white masses of downy\r\nfluff, but when we arrived on the scene their plumage was almost\r\ncomplete. Very often one of the parent birds was on guard near the\r\nnest. We did not enjoy attacking these birds, but our hunger knew no\r\nlaw. They tasted so very good and assisted our recuperation to such an\r\nextent that each time we killed one of them we felt a little less\r\nremorseful.\r\n\r\nMay 15 was a great day. We made our hoosh at 7.30 a.m. Then we loaded\r\nup the boat and gave her a flying launch down the steep beach into the\r\nsurf. Heavy rain had fallen in the night and a gusty north-westerly\r\nwind was now blowing, with misty showers. The _James Caird_ headed to\r\nthe sea as if anxious to face the battle of the waves once more. We\r\npassed through the narrow mouth of the cove with the ugly rocks and\r\nwaving kelp close on either side, turned to the east, and sailed\r\nmerrily up the bay as the sun broke through the mists and made the\r\ntossing waters sparkle around us. We were a curious-looking party on\r\nthat bright morning, but we were feeling happy. We even broke into\r\nsong, and, but for our Robinson Crusoe appearance, a casual observer\r\nmight have taken us for a picnic party sailing in a Norwegian fiord or\r\none of the beautiful sounds of the west coast of New Zealand. The wind\r\nblew fresh and strong, and a small sea broke on the coast as we\r\nadvanced. The surf was sufficient to have endangered the boat if we had\r\nattempted to land where the carcass of the sea-elephant was lying, so\r\nwe decided to go on to the head of the bay without risking anything,\r\nparticularly as we were likely to find sea-elephants on the upper\r\nbeaches. The big creatures have a habit of seeking peaceful quarters\r\nprotected from the waves. We had hopes, too, of finding penguins. Our\r\nexpectation as far as the sea-elephants were concerned was not at\r\nfault. We heard the roar of the bulls as we neared the head of the bay,\r\nand soon afterwards saw the great unwieldy forms of the beasts lying on\r\na shelving beach towards the bay-head. We rounded a high, glacier-worn\r\nbluff on the north side, and at 12.30 p.m. we ran the boat ashore on a\r\nlow beach of sand and pebbles, with tussock growing above high-water\r\nmark. There were hundreds of sea-elephants lying about, and our\r\nanxieties with regard to food disappeared. Meat and blubber enough to\r\nfeed our party for years was in sight. Our landing-place was about a\r\nmile and a half west of the north-east corner of the bay. Just east of\r\nus was a glacier-snout ending on the beach but giving a passage towards\r\nthe head of the bay, except at high water or when a very heavy surf was\r\nrunning. A cold, drizzling rain had begun to fall, and we provided\r\nourselves with shelter as quickly as possible. We hauled the _James\r\nCaird_ up above highwater mark and turned her over just to the lee or\r\neast side of the bluff. The spot was separated from the mountain-side\r\nby a low morainic bank, rising twenty or thirty feet above sea-level.\r\nSoon we had converted the boat into a very comfortable cabin _à la_\r\nPeggotty, turfing it round with tussocks, which we dug up with knives.\r\nOne side of the _James Caird_ rested on stones so as to afford a low\r\nentrance, and when we had finished she looked as though she had grown\r\nthere. McCarthy entered into this work with great spirit. A\r\nsea-elephant provided us with fuel and meat, and that evening found a\r\nwell-fed and fairly contented party at rest in Peggotty Camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sea Elephants on South Georgia]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Cliffs we descended whilst crossing the Island]\r\n\r\n\r\nOur camp, as I have said, lay on the north side of King Haakon Bay near\r\nthe head. Our path towards the whaling-stations led round the seaward\r\nend of the snouted glacier on the east side of the camp and up a\r\nsnow-slope that appeared to lead to a pass in the great Allardyce\r\nRange, which runs north-west and south-east and forms the main backbone\r\nof South Georgia. The range dipped opposite the bay into a well-defined\r\npass from east to west. An ice-sheet covered most of the interior,\r\nfilling the valleys and disguising the configurations of the land,\r\nwhich, indeed, showed only in big rocky ridges, peaks, and nunataks.\r\nWhen we looked up the pass from Peggotty Camp the country to the left\r\nappeared to offer two easy paths through to the opposite coast, but we\r\nknew that the island was uninhabited at that point (Possession Bay). We\r\nhad to turn our attention farther east, and it was impossible from the\r\ncamp to learn much of the conditions that would confront us on the\r\noverland journey. I planned to climb to the pass and then be guided by\r\nthe configuration of the country in the selection of a route eastward\r\nto Stromness Bay, where the whaling-stations were established in the\r\nminor bays, Leith, Husvik, and Stromness. A range of mountains with\r\nprecipitous slopes, forbidding peaks, and large glaciers lay\r\nimmediately to the south of King Haakon Bay and seemed to form a\r\ncontinuation of the main range. Between this secondary range and the\r\npass above our camp a great snow-upland sloped up to the inland\r\nice-sheet and reached a rocky ridge that stretched athwart our path and\r\nseemed to bar the way. This ridge was a right-angled offshoot from the\r\nmain ridge. Its chief features were four rocky peaks with spaces\r\nbetween that looked from a distance as though they might prove to be\r\npasses.\r\n\r\nThe weather was bad on Tuesday, May 16, and we stayed under the boat\r\nnearly all day. The quarters were cramped but gave full protection from\r\nthe weather, and we regarded our little cabin with a great deal of\r\nsatisfaction. Abundant meals of sea-elephant steak and liver increased\r\nour contentment. McNeish reported during the day that he had seen rats\r\nfeeding on the scraps, but this interesting statement was not verified.\r\nOne would not expect to find rats at such a spot, but there was a bare\r\npossibility that they had landed from a wreck and managed to survive\r\nthe very rigorous conditions.\r\n\r\nA fresh west-south-westerly breeze was blowing on the following morning\r\n(Wednesday, May 17), with misty squalls, sleet, and rain. I took\r\nWorsley with me on a pioneer journey to the west with the object of\r\nexamining the country to be traversed at the beginning of the overland\r\njourney. We went round the seaward end of the snouted glacier, and\r\nafter tramping about a mile over stony ground and snow-coated debris,\r\nwe crossed some big ridges of scree and moraines. We found that there\r\nwas good going for a sledge as far as the north-east corner of the bay,\r\nbut did not get much information regarding the conditions farther on\r\nowing to the view becoming obscured by a snow-squall. We waited a\r\nquarter of an hour for the weather to clear but were forced to turn\r\nback without having seen more of the country. I had satisfied myself,\r\nhowever, that we could reach a good snow-slope leading apparently to\r\nthe inland ice. Worsley reckoned from the chart that the distance from\r\nour camp to Husvik, on an east magnetic course, was seventeen\r\ngeographical miles, but we could not expect to follow a direct line.\r\nThe carpenter started making a sledge for use on the overland journey.\r\nThe materials at his disposal were limited in quantity and scarcely\r\nsuitable in quality.\r\n\r\nWe overhauled our gear on Thursday, May 18; and hauled our sledge to\r\nthe lower edge of the snouted glacier. The vehicle proved heavy and\r\ncumbrous. We had to lift it empty over bare patches of rock along the\r\nshore, and I realized that it would be too heavy for three men to\r\nmanage amid the snow-plains, glaciers, and peaks of the interior.\r\nWorsley and Crean were coming with me, and after consultation we\r\ndecided to leave the sleeping-bags behind us and make the journey in\r\nvery light marching order. We would take three days’ provisions for\r\neach man in the form of sledging ration and biscuit. The food was to be\r\npacked in three sacks, so that each member of the party could carry his\r\nown supply. Then we were to take the Primus lamp filled with oil, the\r\nsmall cooker, the carpenter’s adze (for use as an ice-axe), and the\r\nalpine rope, which made a total length of fifty feet when knotted. We\r\nmight have to lower ourselves down steep slopes or cross crevassed\r\nglaciers. The filled lamp would provide six hot meals, which would\r\nconsist of sledging ration boiled up with biscuit. There were two boxes\r\nof matches left, one full and the other partially used. We left the\r\nfull box with the men at the camp and took the second box, which\r\ncontained forty-eight matches. I was unfortunate as regarded footgear,\r\nsince I had given away my heavy Burberry boots on the floe, and had now\r\na comparatively light pair in poor condition. The carpenter assisted me\r\nby putting several screws in the sole of each boot with the object of\r\nproviding a grip on the ice. The screws came out of the _James Caird_.\r\n\r\nWe turned in early that night, but sleep did not come to me. My mind\r\nwas busy with the task of the following day. The weather was clear and\r\nthe outlook for an early start in the morning was good. We were going\r\nto leave a weak party behind us in the camp. Vincent was still in the\r\nsame condition, and he could not march. McNeish was pretty well broken\r\nup. The two men were not capable of managing for themselves and\r\nMcCarthy must stay to look after them. He might have a difficult task\r\nif we failed to reach the whaling station. The distance to Husvik,\r\naccording to the chart, was no more than seventeen geographical miles\r\nin a direct line, but we had very scanty knowledge of the conditions of\r\nthe interior. No man had ever penetrated a mile from the coast of South\r\nGeorgia at any point, and the whalers I knew regarded the country as\r\ninaccessible. During that day, while we were walking to the snouted\r\nglacier, we had seen three wild duck flying towards the head of the bay\r\nfrom the eastward. I hoped that the presence of these birds indicated\r\ntussock-land and not snow-fields and glaciers in the interior, but the\r\nhope was not a very bright one.\r\n\r\nWe turned out at 2 a.m. on the Friday morning and had our hoosh ready\r\nan hour later. The full moon was shining in a practically cloudless\r\nsky, its rays reflected gloriously from the pinnacles and crevassed ice\r\nof the adjacent glaciers. The huge peaks of the mountains stood in bold\r\nrelief against the sky and threw dark shadows on the waters of the\r\nsound. There was no need for delay, and we made a start as soon as we\r\nhad eaten our meal. McNeish walked about 200 yds with us; he could do\r\nno more. Then we said good-bye and he turned back to the camp. The\r\nfirst task was to get round the edge of the snouted glacier, which had\r\npoints like fingers projecting towards the sea. The waves were reaching\r\nthe points of these fingers, and we had to rush from one recess to\r\nanother when the waters receded. We soon reached the east side of the\r\nglacier and noticed its great activity at this point. Changes had\r\noccurred within the preceding twenty-four hours. Some huge pieces had\r\nbroken off, and the masses of mud and stone that were being driven\r\nbefore the advancing ice showed movement. The glacier was like a\r\ngigantic plough driving irresistibly towards the sea.\r\n\r\nLying on the beach beyond the glacier was wreckage that told of many\r\nill-fated ships. We noticed stanchions of teakwood, liberally carved,\r\nthat must have came from ships of the older type; iron-bound timbers\r\nwith the iron almost rusted through; battered barrels and all the usual\r\ndebris of the ocean. We had difficulties and anxieties of our own, but\r\nas we passed that graveyard of the sea we thought of the many tragedies\r\nwritten in the wave-worn fragments of lost vessels. We did not pause,\r\nand soon we were ascending a snow-slope heading due east on the last\r\nlap of our long trail.\r\n\r\nThe snow-surface was disappointing. Two days before we had been able to\r\nmove rapidly on hard, packed snow; now we sank over our ankles at each\r\nstep and progress was slow. After two hours’ steady climbing we were\r\n2500 ft. above sea-level. The weather continued fine and calm, and as\r\nthe ridges drew nearer and the western coast of the island spread out\r\nbelow, the bright moonlight showed us that the interior was broken\r\ntremendously. High peaks, impassable cliffs, steep snow-slopes, and\r\nsharply descending glaciers were prominent features in all directions,\r\nwith stretches of snow-plain over laying the ice-sheet of the interior.\r\nThe slope we were ascending mounted to a ridge and our course lay\r\ndirect to the top. The moon, which proved a good friend during this\r\njourney, threw a long shadow at one point and told us that the surface\r\nwas broken in our path. Warned in time, we avoided a huge hole capable\r\nof swallowing an army. The bay was now about three miles away, and the\r\ncontinued roaring of a big glacier at the head of the bay came to our\r\nears. This glacier, which we had noticed during the stay at Peggotty\r\nCamp, seemed to be calving almost continuously.\r\n\r\nI had hoped to get a view of the country ahead of us from the top of\r\nthe slope, but as the surface became more level beneath our feet, a\r\nthick fog drifted down. The moon became obscured and produced a\r\ndiffused light that was more trying than darkness, since it illuminated\r\nthe fog without guiding our steps. We roped ourselves together as a\r\nprecaution against holes, crevasses, and precipices, and I broke trail\r\nthrough the soft snow. With almost the full length of the rope between\r\nmyself and the last man we were able to steer an approximately straight\r\ncourse, since, if I veered to the right or the left when marching into\r\nthe blank wall of the fog, the last man on the rope could shout a\r\ndirection. So, like a ship with its “port,” “starboard,” “steady,” we\r\ntramped through the fog for the next two hours.\r\n\r\nThen, as daylight came, the fog thinned and lifted, and from an\r\nelevation of about 3000 ft. we looked down on what seemed to be a huge\r\nfrozen lake with its farther shores still obscured by the fog. We\r\nhalted there to eat a bit of biscuit while we discussed whether we\r\nwould go down and cross the flat surface of the lake, or keep on the\r\nridge we had already reached. I decided to go down, since the lake lay\r\non our course. After an hour of comparatively easy travel through the\r\nsnow we noticed the thin beginnings of crevasses. Soon they were\r\nincreasing in size and showing fractures, indicating that we were\r\ntravelling on a glacier. As the daylight brightened the fog dissipated;\r\nthe lake could be seen more clearly, but still we could not discover\r\nits east shore. A little later the fog lifted completely, and then we\r\nsaw that our lake stretched to the horizon, and realized suddenly that\r\nwe were looking down upon the open sea on the east coast of the island.\r\nThe slight pulsation at the shore showed that the sea was not even\r\nfrozen; it was the bad light that had deceived us. Evidently we were at\r\nthe top of Possession Bay, and the island at that point could not be\r\nmore than five miles across from the head of King Haakon Bay. Our rough\r\nchart was inaccurate. There was nothing for it but to start up the\r\nglacier again. That was about seven o’clock in the morning, and by nine\r\no’clock we had more than recovered our lost ground. We regained the\r\nridge and then struck south-east, for the chart showed that two more\r\nbays indented the coast before Stromness. It was comforting to realize\r\nthat we would have the eastern water in sight during our journey,\r\nalthough we could see there was no way around the shore line owing to\r\nsteep cliffs and glaciers. Men lived in houses lit by electric light on\r\nthe east coast. News of the outside world waited us there, and, above\r\nall, the east coast meant for us the means of rescuing the twenty-two\r\nmen we had left on Elephant Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\nACROSS SOUTH GEORGIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun rose in the sky with every appearance of a fine day, and we\r\ngrew warmer as we toiled through the soft snow. Ahead of us lay the\r\nridges and spurs of a range of mountains, the transverse range that we\r\nhad noticed from the bay. We were travelling over a gently rising\r\nplateau, and at the end of an hour we found ourselves growing\r\nuncomfortably hot. Years before, on an earlier expedition, I had\r\ndeclared that I would never again growl at the heat of the sun, and my\r\nresolution had been strengthened during the boat journey. I called it\r\nto mind as the sun beat fiercely on the blinding white snow-slope.\r\nAfter passing an area of crevasses we paused for our first meal. We dug\r\na hole in the snow about three feet deep with the adze and put the\r\nPrimus into it. There was no wind at the moment, but a gust might come\r\nsuddenly. A hot hoosh was soon eaten and we plodded on towards a sharp\r\nridge between two of the peaks already mentioned. By 11 a.m. we were\r\nalmost at the crest. The slope had become precipitous and it was\r\nnecessary to cut steps as we advanced. The adze proved an excellent\r\ninstrument for this purpose, a blow sufficing to provide a foothold.\r\nAnxiously but hopefully I cut the last few steps and stood upon the\r\nrazor-back, while the other men held the rope and waited for my news.\r\nThe outlook was disappointing. I looked down a sheer precipice to a\r\nchaos of crumpled ice 1500 ft. below. There was no way down for us. The\r\ncountry to the east was a great snow upland, sloping upwards for a\r\ndistance of seven or eight miles to a height of over 4000 ft. To the\r\nnorth it fell away steeply in glaciers into the bays, and to the south\r\nit was broken by huge outfalls from the inland ice-sheet. Our path lay\r\nbetween the glaciers and the outfalls, but first we had to descend from\r\nthe ridge on which we stood. Cutting steps with the adze, we moved in a\r\nlateral direction round the base of a dolomite, which blocked our view\r\nto the north. The same precipice confronted us. Away to the north-east\r\nthere appeared to be a snow-slope that might give a path to the lower\r\ncountry, and so we retraced our steps down the long slope that had\r\ntaken us three hours to climb. We were at the bottom in an hour. We\r\nwere now feeling the strain of the unaccustomed marching. We had done\r\nlittle walking since January and our muscles were out of tune. Skirting\r\nthe base of the mountain above us, we came to a gigantic bergschrund, a\r\nmile and a half long and 1000 ft. deep. This tremendous gully, cut in\r\nthe snow and ice by the fierce winds blowing round the mountain, was\r\nsemicircular in form, and it ended in a gentle incline. We passed\r\nthrough it, under the towering precipice of ice, and at the far end we\r\nhad another meal and a short rest. This was at 12:30 p.m. Half a pot of\r\nsteaming Bovril ration warmed us up, and when we marched again\r\nice-inclines at angles of 45 degrees did not look quite as formidable\r\nas before.\r\n\r\nOnce more we started for the crest. After another weary climb we\r\nreached the top. The snow lay thinly on blue ice at the ridge, and we\r\nhad to cut steps over the last fifty yards. The same precipice lay\r\nbelow, and my eyes searched vainly for a way down. The hot sun had\r\nloosened the snow, which was now in a treacherous condition, and we had\r\nto pick our way carefully. Looking back, we could see that a fog was\r\nrolling up behind us and meeting in the valleys a fog that was coming\r\nup from the east. The creeping grey clouds were a plain warning that we\r\nmust get down to lower levels before becoming enveloped.\r\n\r\nThe ridge was studded with peaks, which prevented us getting a clear\r\nview either to the right or to the left. The situation in this respect\r\nseemed no better at other points within our reach, and I had to decide\r\nthat our course lay back the way we had come. The afternoon was wearing\r\non and the fog was rolling up ominously from the west. It was of the\r\nutmost importance for us to get down into the next valley before dark.\r\nWe were now up 4500 ft. and the night temperature at that elevation\r\nwould be very low. We had no tent and no sleeping-bags, and our clothes\r\nhad endured much rough usage and had weathered many storms during the\r\nlast ten months. In the distance, down the valley below us, we could\r\nsee tussock-grass close to the shore, and if we could get down it might\r\nbe possible to dig out a hole in one of the lower snow-banks, line it\r\nwith dry grass, and make ourselves fairly comfortable for the night.\r\nBack we went, and after a detour we reached the top of another ridge in\r\nthe fading light. After a glance over the top I turned to the anxious\r\nfaces of the two men behind me and said, “Come on, boys.” Within a\r\nminute they stood beside me on the ice-ridge. The surface fell away at\r\na sharp incline in front of us, but it merged into a snow-slope. We\r\ncould not see the bottom clearly owing to mist and bad light, and the\r\npossibility of the slope ending in a sheer fall occurred to us; but the\r\nfog that was creeping up behind allowed no time for hesitation. We\r\ndescended slowly at first, cutting steps in the snow; then the surface\r\nbecame softer, indicating that the gradient was less severe. There\r\ncould be no turning back now, so we unroped and slid in the fashion of\r\nyouthful days. When we stopped on a snow-bank at the foot of the slope\r\nwe found that we had descended at least 900 ft. in two or three\r\nminutes. We looked back and saw the grey fingers of the fog appearing\r\non the ridge, as though reaching after the intruders into untrodden\r\nwilds. But we had escaped.\r\n\r\nThe country to the east was an ascending snow upland dividing the\r\nglaciers of the north coast from the outfalls of the south. We had seen\r\nfrom the top that our course lay between two huge masses of crevasses,\r\nand we thought that the road ahead lay clear. This belief and the\r\nincreasing cold made us abandon the idea of camping. We had another\r\nmeal at 6 p.m. A little breeze made cooking difficult in spite of the\r\nshelter provided for the cooker by a hole. Crean was the cook, and\r\nWorsley and I lay on the snow to windward of the lamp so as to break\r\nthe wind with our bodies. The meal over, we started up the long, gentle\r\nascent. Night was upon us, and for an hour we plodded along in almost\r\ncomplete darkness, watching warily for signs of crevasses. Then about 8\r\np.m. a glow which we had seen behind the jagged peaks resolved itself\r\ninto the full moon, which rose ahead of us and made a silver pathway\r\nfor our feet. Along that pathway in the wake of the moon we advanced in\r\nsafety, with the shadows cast by the edges of crevasses showing black\r\non either side of us. Onwards and upwards through soft snow we marched,\r\nresting now and then on hard patches which had revealed themselves by\r\nglittering ahead of us in the white light. By midnight we were again at\r\nan elevation of about 4000 ft. Still we were following the light, for\r\nas the moon swung round towards the north-east, our path curved in that\r\ndirection. The friendly moon seemed to pilot our weary feet. We could\r\nhave had no better guide. If in bright daylight we had made that march\r\nwe would have followed the course that was traced for us that night.\r\n\r\nMidnight found us approaching the edge of a great snowfield, pierced by\r\nisolated nunataks which cast long shadows like black rivers across the\r\nwhite expanse. A gentle slope to the north-east lured our\r\nall-too-willing feet in that direction. We thought that at the base of\r\nthe slope lay Stromness Bay. After we had descended about 300 ft. a\r\nthin wind began to attack us. We had now been on the march for over\r\ntwenty hours, only halting for our occasional meals. Wisps of cloud\r\ndrove over the high peaks to the southward, warning us that wind and\r\nsnow were likely to come. After 1 a.m. we cut a pit in the snow, piled\r\nup loose snow around it, and started the Primus again. The hot food\r\ngave us another renewal of energy. Worsley and Crean sang their old\r\nsongs when the Primus was going merrily. Laughter was in our hearts,\r\nthough not on our parched and cracked lips.\r\n\r\nWe were up and away again within half an hour, still downward to the\r\ncoast. We felt almost sure now that we were above Stromness Bay. A dark\r\nobject down at the foot of the slope looked like Mutton Island, which\r\nlies off Husvik. I suppose our desires were giving wings to our\r\nfancies, for we pointed out joyfully various landmarks revealed by the\r\nnow vagrant light of the moon, whose friendly face was cloud-swept. Our\r\nhigh hopes were soon shattered. Crevasses warned us that we were on\r\nanother glacier, and soon we looked down almost to the seaward edge of\r\nthe great riven ice-mass. I knew there was no glacier in Stromness and\r\nrealized that this must be Fortuna Glacier. The disappointment was\r\nsevere. Back we turned and tramped up the glacier again, not directly\r\ntracing our steps but working at a tangent to the south-east. We were\r\nvery tired.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One of the Glaciers we Crossed]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Typical View in South Georgia]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 5 a.m. we were at the foot of the rocky spurs of the range. We were\r\ntired, and the wind that blew down from the heights was chilling us. We\r\ndecided to get down under the lee of a rock for a rest. We put our\r\nsticks and the adze on the snow, sat down on them as close to one\r\nanother as possible, and put our arms round each other. The wind was\r\nbringing a little drift with it and the white dust lay on our clothes.\r\nI thought that we might be able to keep warm and have half an hour’s\r\nrest this way. Within a minute my two companions were fast asleep. I\r\nrealized that it would be disastrous if we all slumbered together, for\r\nsleep under such conditions merges into death. After five minutes I\r\nshook them into consciousness again, told them that they had slept for\r\nhalf an hour, and gave the word for a fresh start. We were so stiff\r\nthat for the first two or three hundred yards we marched with our knees\r\nbent. A jagged line of peaks with a gap like a broken tooth confronted\r\nus. This was the ridge that runs in a southerly direction from Fortuna\r\nBay, and our course eastward to Stromness lay across it. A very steep\r\nslope led up to the ridge and an icy wind burst through the gap.\r\n\r\nWe went through the gap at 6 a.m. with anxious hearts as well as weary\r\nbodies. If the farther slope had proved impassable our situation would\r\nhave been almost desperate; but the worst was turning to the best for\r\nus. The twisted, wave-like rock formations of Husvik Harbour appeared\r\nright ahead in the opening of dawn. Without a word we shook hands with\r\none another. To our minds the journey was over, though as a matter of\r\nfact twelve miles of difficult country had still to be traversed. A\r\ngentle snow-slope descended at our feet towards a valley that separated\r\nour ridge from the hills immediately behind Husvik, and as we stood\r\ngazing Worsley said solemnly, “Boss, it looks too good to be true!”\r\nDown we went, to be checked presently by the sight of water 2500 ft.\r\nbelow. We could see the little wave-ripples on the black beach,\r\npenguins strutting to and fro, and dark objects that looked like seals\r\nlolling lazily on the sand. This was an eastern arm of Fortuna Bay,\r\nseparated by the ridge from the arm we had seen below us during the\r\nnight. The slope we were traversing appeared to end in a precipice\r\nabove this beach. But our revived spirits were not to be damped by\r\ndifficulties on the last stage of the journey, and we camped cheerfully\r\nfor breakfast. Whilst Worsley and Crean were digging a hole for the\r\nlamp and starting the cooker I climbed a ridge above us, cutting steps\r\nwith the adze, in order to secure an extended view of the country\r\nbelow. At 6.30 a.m. I thought I heard the sound of a steam-whistle. I\r\ndared not be certain, but I knew that the men at the whaling-station\r\nwould be called from their beds about that time. Descending to the camp\r\nI told the others, and in intense excitement we watched the chronometer\r\nfor seven o’clock, when the whalers would be summoned to work. Right to\r\nthe minute the steam-whistle came to us, borne clearly on the wind\r\nacross the intervening miles of rock and snow. Never had any one of us\r\nheard sweeter music. It was the first sound created by outside human\r\nagency that had come to our ears since we left Stromness Bay in\r\nDecember 1914. That whistle told us that men were living near, that\r\nships were ready, and that within a few hours we should be on our way\r\nback to Elephant Island to the rescue of the men waiting there under\r\nthe watch and ward of Wild. It was a moment hard to describe. Pain and\r\nache, boat journeys, marches, hunger and fatigue seemed to belong to\r\nthe limbo of forgotten things, and there remained only the perfect\r\ncontentment that comes of work accomplished.\r\n\r\nMy examination of the country from a higher point had not provided\r\ndefinite information, and after descending I put the situation before\r\nWorsley and Crean. Our obvious course lay down a snow-slope in the\r\ndirection of Husvik. “Boys,” I said, “this snow-slope seems to end in a\r\nprecipice, but perhaps there is no precipice. If we don’t go down we\r\nshall have to make a detour of at least five miles before we reach\r\nlevel going. What shall it be?” They both replied at once, “Try the\r\nslope.” So we started away again downwards. We abandoned the Primus\r\nlamp, now empty, at the breakfast camp and carried with us one ration\r\nand a biscuit each. The deepest snow we had yet encountered clogged our\r\nfeet, but we plodded downward, and after descending about 500 ft.,\r\nreducing our altitude to 2000 ft. above sea-level, we thought we saw\r\nthe way clear ahead. A steep gradient of blue ice was the next\r\nobstacle. Worsley and Crean got a firm footing in a hole excavated with\r\nthe adze and then lowered me as I cut steps until the full 50 ft. of\r\nour alpine rope was out. Then I made a hole big enough for the three of\r\nus, and the other two men came down the steps. My end of the rope was\r\nanchored to the adze and I had settled myself in the hole braced for a\r\nstrain in case they slipped. When we all stood in the second hole I\r\nwent down again to make more steps, and in this laborious fashion we\r\nspent two hours descending about 500 ft. Halfway down we had to strike\r\naway diagonally to the left, for we noticed that the fragments of ice\r\nloosened by the adze were taking a leap into space at the bottom of the\r\nslope. Eventually we got off the steep ice, very gratefully, at a point\r\nwhere some rocks protruded, and we could see then that there was a\r\nperilous precipice directly below the point where we had started to cut\r\nsteps. A slide down a slippery slope, with the adze and our cooker\r\ngoing ahead, completed this descent, and incidentally did considerable\r\ndamage to our much-tried trousers.\r\n\r\nWhen we picked ourselves up at the bottom we were not more than 1500\r\nft. above the sea. The slope was comparatively easy. Water was running\r\nbeneath the snow, making “pockets” between the rocks that protruded\r\nabove the white surface. The shells of snow over these pockets were\r\ntraps for our feet; but we scrambled down, and presently came to\r\npatches of tussock. A few minutes later we reached the sandy beach. The\r\ntracks of some animals were to be seen, and we were puzzled until I\r\nremembered that reindeer, brought from Norway, had been placed on the\r\nisland and now ranged along the lower land of the eastern coast. We did\r\nnot pause to investigate. Our minds were set upon reaching the haunts\r\nof man, and at our best speed we went along the beach to another rising\r\nridge of tussock. Here we saw the first evidence of the proximity of\r\nman, whose work, as is so often the ease, was one of destruction. A\r\nrecently killed seal was lying there, and presently we saw several\r\nother bodies bearing the marks of bullet-wounds. I learned later that\r\nmen from the whaling-station at Stromness sometimes go round to Fortuna\r\nBay by boat to shoot seals.\r\n\r\nNoon found us well up the slope on the other side of the bay working\r\neast-south-east, and half an hour later we were on a flat plateau, with\r\none more ridge to cross before we descended into Husvik. I was leading\r\nthe way over this plateau when I suddenly found myself up to my knees\r\nin water and quickly sinking deeper through the snow-crust. I flung\r\nmyself down and called to the others to do the same, so as to\r\ndistribute our weight on the treacherous surface. We were on top of a\r\nsmall lake, snow-covered. After lying still for a few moments we got to\r\nour feet and walked delicately, like Agag, for 200 yds., until a rise\r\nin the surface showed us that we were clear of the lake.\r\n\r\nAt 1.30 p.m. we climbed round a final ridge and saw a little steamer, a\r\nwhaling-boat, entering the bay 2500 ft, below. A few moments later, as\r\nwe hurried forward, the masts of a sailing-ship lying at a wharf came\r\nin sight. Minute figures moving to and fro about the boats caught our\r\ngaze, and then we saw the sheds and factory of Stromness\r\nwhaling-station. We paused and shook hands, a form of mutual\r\ncongratulation that had seemed necessary on four other occasions in the\r\ncourse of the expedition. The first time was when we landed on Elephant\r\nIsland, the second when we reached South Georgia, and the third when we\r\nreached the ridge and saw the snow-slope stretching below on the first\r\nday of the overland journey, then when we saw Husvik rocks.\r\n\r\nCautiously we started down the slope that led to warmth and comfort.\r\nThe last lap of the journey proved extraordinarily difficult. Vainly we\r\nsearched for a safe, or a reasonably safe, way down the steep ice-clad\r\nmountain-side. The sole possible pathway seemed to be a channel cut by\r\nwater running from the upland. Down through icy water we followed the\r\ncourse of this stream. We were wet to the waist, shivering, cold, and\r\ntired. Presently our ears detected an unwelcome sound that might have\r\nbeen musical under other conditions. It was the splashing of a\r\nwaterfall, and we were at the wrong end. When we reached the top of\r\nthis fall we peered over cautiously and discovered that there was a\r\ndrop of 25 or 30 ft., with impassable ice-cliffs on both sides. To go\r\nup again was scarcely thinkable in our utterly wearied condition. The\r\nway down was through the waterfall itself. We made fast one end of our\r\nrope to a boulder with some difficulty, due to the fact that the rocks\r\nhad been worn smooth by the running water. Then Worsley and I lowered\r\nCrean, who was the heaviest man. He disappeared altogether in the\r\nfalling water and came out gasping at the bottom. I went next, sliding\r\ndown the rope, and Worsley, who was the lightest and most nimble member\r\nof the party, came last. At the bottom of the fall we were able to\r\nstand again on dry land. The rope could not be recovered. We had flung\r\ndown the adze from the top of the fall and also the logbook and the\r\ncooker wrapped in one of our blouses. That was all, except our wet\r\nclothes, that we brought out of the Antarctic, which we had entered a\r\nyear and a half before with well-found ship, full equipment, and high\r\nhopes. That was all of tangible things; but in memories we were rich.\r\nWe had pierced the veneer of outside things. We had “suffered, starved,\r\nand triumphed, grovelled down yet grasped at glory, grown bigger in the\r\nbigness of the whole.” We had seen God in His splendours, heard the\r\ntext that Nature renders. We had reached the naked soul of man.\r\n\r\nShivering with cold, yet with hearts light and happy, we set off\r\ntowards the whaling-station, now not more than a mile and a half\r\ndistant. The difficulties of the journey lay behind us. We tried to\r\nstraighten ourselves up a bit, for the thought that there might be\r\nwomen at the station made us painfully conscious of our uncivilized\r\nappearance. Our beards were long and our hair was matted. We were\r\nunwashed and the garments that we had worn for nearly a year without a\r\nchange were tattered and stained. Three more unpleasant-looking\r\nruffians could hardly have been imagined. Worsley produced several\r\nsafety-pins from some corner of his garments and effected some\r\ntemporary repairs that really emphasized his general disrepair. Down we\r\nhurried, and when quite close to the station we met two small boys ten\r\nor twelve years of age. I asked these lads where the manager’s house\r\nwas situated. They did not answer. They gave us one look—a\r\ncomprehensive look that did not need to be repeated. Then they ran from\r\nus as fast as their legs would carry them. We reached the outskirts of\r\nthe station and passed through the “digesting-house,” which was dark\r\ninside. Emerging at the other end, we met an old man, who started as if\r\nhe had seen the Devil himself and gave us no time to ask any question.\r\nHe hurried away. This greeting was not friendly. Then we came to the\r\nwharf, where the man in charge stuck to his station. I asked him if Mr.\r\nSorlle (the manager) was in the house.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said as he stared at us.\r\n\r\n“We would like to see him,” said I.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“We have lost our ship and come over the island,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“You have come over the island?” he said in a tone of entire disbelief.\r\n\r\nThe man went towards the manager’s house and we followed him. I learned\r\nafterwards that he said to Mr. Sorlle: “There are three funny-looking\r\nmen outside, who say they have come over the island and they know you.\r\nI have left them outside.” A very necessary precaution from his point\r\nof view.\r\n\r\nMr. Sorlle came out to the door and said, “Well?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you know me?” I said.\r\n\r\n“I know your voice,” he replied doubtfully. “You’re the mate of the\r\n_Daisy_.”\r\n\r\n“My name is Shackleton,” I said.\r\n\r\nImmediately he put out his hand and said, “Come in. Come in.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me, when was the war over?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“The war is not over,” he answered. “Millions are being killed. Europe\r\nis mad. The world is mad.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Rough Memory Map of Route Across South Georgia]]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Sorlle’s hospitality had no bounds. He would scarcely let us wait\r\nto remove our freezing boots before he took us into his house and gave\r\nus seats in a warm and comfortable room. We were in no condition to sit\r\nin anybody’s house until we had washed and got into clean clothes, but\r\nthe kindness of the station-manager was proof even against the\r\nunpleasantness of being in a room with us. He gave us coffee and cakes\r\nin the Norwegian fashion, and then showed us upstairs to the bathroom,\r\nwhere we shed our rags and scrubbed ourselves luxuriously.\r\n\r\nMr. Sorlle’s kindness did not end with his personal care for the three\r\nwayfarers who had come to his door. While we were washing he gave\r\norders for one of the whaling-vessels to be prepared at once in order\r\nthat it might leave that night for the other side of the island and\r\npick up the three men there. The whalers knew King Haakon Bay, though\r\nthey never worked on that side of the island. Soon we were clean again.\r\nThen we put on delightful new clothes supplied from the station stores\r\nand got rid of our superfluous hair. Within an hour or two we had\r\nceased to be savages and had become civilized men again. Then came a\r\nsplendid meal, while Mr. Sorlle told us of the arrangements he had made\r\nand we discussed plans for the rescue of the main party on Elephant\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nI arranged that Worsley should go with the relief ship to show the\r\nexact spot where the carpenter and his two companions were camped,\r\nwhile I started to prepare for the relief of the party on Elephant\r\nIsland. The whaling-vessel that was going round to King Haakon Bay was\r\nexpected back on the Monday morning, and was to call at Grytviken\r\nHarbour, the port from which we had sailed in December 1914, in order\r\nthat the magistrate resident there might be informed of the fate of the\r\n_Endurance_. It was possible that letters were awaiting us there.\r\nWorsley went aboard the whaler at ten o’clock that night and turned in.\r\nThe next day the relief ship entered King Haakon Bay and he reached\r\nPeggotty Camp in a boat. The three men were delighted beyond measure to\r\nknow that we had made the crossing in safety and that their wait under\r\nthe upturned _James Caird_ was ended. Curiously enough, they did not\r\nrecognize Worsley, who had left them a hairy, dirty ruffian and had\r\nreturned his spruce and shaven self. They thought he was one of the\r\nwhalers. When one of them asked why no member of the party had come\r\nround with the relief, Worsley said, “What do you mean?” “We thought\r\nthe Boss or one of the others would come round,” they explained.\r\n“What’s the matter with you?” said Worsley. Then it suddenly dawned\r\nupon them that they were talking to the man who had been their close\r\ncompanion for a year and a half. Within a few minutes the whalers had\r\nmoved our bits of gear into their boat. They towed off the _James\r\nCaird_ and hoisted her to the deck of their ship. Then they started on\r\nthe return voyage. Just at dusk on Monday afternoon they entered\r\nStromness Bay, where the men of the whaling-station mustered on the\r\nbeach to receive the rescued party and to examine with professional\r\ninterest the boat we had navigated across 800 miles of the stormy ocean\r\nthey knew so well.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Panorama of South Georgia]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I look back at those days I have no doubt that Providence guided\r\nus, not only across those snowfields, but across the storm-white sea\r\nthat separated Elephant Island from our landing-place on South Georgia.\r\nI know that during that long and racking march of thirty-six hours over\r\nthe unnamed mountains and glaciers of South Georgia it seemed to me\r\noften that we were four, not three. I said nothing to my companions on\r\nthe point, but afterwards Worsley said to me, “Boss, I had a curious\r\nfeeling on the march that there was another person with us.” Crean\r\nconfessed to the same idea. One feels “the dearth of human words, the\r\nroughness of mortal speech” in trying to describe things intangible,\r\nbut a record of our journeys would be incomplete without a reference to\r\na subject very near to our hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\nTHE RESCUE\r\n\r\n\r\nOur first night at the whaling-station was blissful. Crean and I shared\r\na beautiful room in Mr. Sorlle’s house, with electric light and two\r\nbeds, warm and soft. We were so comfortable that we were unable to\r\nsleep. Late at night a steward brought us tea, bread and butter and\r\ncakes, and we lay in bed, revelling in the luxury of it all. Outside a\r\ndense snow-storm, which started two hours after our arrival and lasted\r\nuntil the following day, was swirling and driving about the\r\nmountain-slopes. We were thankful indeed that we had made a place of\r\nsafety, for it would have gone hard with us if we had been out on the\r\nmountains that night. Deep snow lay everywhere when we got up the\r\nfollowing morning.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast Mr. Sorlle took us round to Husvik in a motor-launch.\r\nWe were listening avidly to his account of the war and of all that had\r\nhappened while we were out of the world of men. We were like men arisen\r\nfrom the dead to a world gone mad. Our minds accustomed themselves\r\ngradually to the tales of nations in arms, of deathless courage and\r\nunimagined slaughter, of a world-conflict that had grown beyond all\r\nconceptions, of vast red battlefields in grimmest contrast with the\r\nfrigid whiteness we had left behind us. The reader may not realize\r\nquite how difficult it was for us to envisage nearly two years of the\r\nmost stupendous war of history. The locking of the armies in the\r\ntrenches, the sinking of the _Lusitania_, the murder of Nurse Cavell,\r\nthe use of poison-gas and liquid fire, the submarine warfare, the\r\nGallipoli campaign, the hundred other incidents of the war, almost\r\nstunned us at first, and then our minds began to compass the train of\r\nevents and develop a perspective. I suppose our experience was unique.\r\nNo other civilized men could have been as blankly ignorant of\r\nworld-shaking happenings as we were when we reached Stromness Whaling\r\nStation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The _Yelcho_]\r\n\r\n\r\nI heard the first rumour of the _Aurora’s_ misadventures in the Ross\r\nSea from Mr. Sorlle. Our host could tell me very little. He had been\r\ninformed that the _Aurora_ had broken away from winter quarters in\r\nMcMurdo Sound and reached New Zealand after a long drift, and that\r\nthere was no news of the shore party. His information was indefinite as\r\nto details, and I had to wait until I reached the Falkland Islands some\r\ntime later before getting a definite report concerning the _Aurora_.\r\nThe rumour that had reached South Georgia, however, made it more than\r\never important that I should bring out the rest of the Weddell Sea\r\nparty quickly, so as to free myself for whatever effort was required on\r\nthe Ross Sea side.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Husvik that Sunday morning we were warmly greeted by\r\nthe magistrate (Mr. Bernsten), whom I knew of old, and the other\r\nmembers of the little community. Moored in the harbour was one of the\r\nlargest of the whalers, the _Southern Sky_, owned by an English company\r\nbut now laid up for the winter. I had no means of getting into\r\ncommunication with the owners without dangerous delay, and on my\r\naccepting all responsibility Mr. Bernsten made arrangements for me to\r\ntake this ship down to Elephant Island. I wrote out an agreement with\r\nLloyd’s for the insurance of the ship. Captain Thom, an old friend of\r\nthe Expedition, happened to be in Husvik with his ship, the _Orwell_,\r\nloading oil for use in Britain’s munition works, and he at once\r\nvolunteered to come with us in any capacity. I asked him to come as\r\ncaptain of the _Southern Sky_. There was no difficulty about getting a\r\ncrew. The whalers were eager to assist in the rescue of men in\r\ndistress. They started work that Sunday to prepare and stow the ship.\r\nParts of the engines were ashore, but willing hands made light labour.\r\nI purchased from the station stores all the stores and equipment\r\nrequired, including special comforts for the men we hoped to rescue,\r\nand by Tuesday morning the _Southern Sky_ was ready to sail. I feel it\r\nis my duty as well as my pleasure to thank here the Norwegian whalers\r\nof South Georgia for the sympathetic hands they stretched out to us in\r\nour need. Among memories of kindness received in many lands sundered by\r\nthe seas, the recollection of the hospitality and help given to me in\r\nSouth Georgia ranks high. There is a brotherhood of the sea. The men\r\nwho go down to the sea in ships, serving and suffering, fighting their\r\nendless battle against the caprice of wind and ocean, bring into their\r\nown horizons the perils and troubles of their brother sailormen.\r\n\r\nThe _Southern Sky_ was ready on Tuesday morning, and at nine o’clock we\r\nsteamed out of the bay, while the whistles of the whaling-station\r\nsounded a friendly farewell. We had forgathered aboard Captain Thom’s\r\nship on the Monday night with several whaling captains who were\r\nbringing up their sons to their own profession. They were “old stagers”\r\nwith faces lined and seamed by the storms of half a century, and they\r\nwere even more interested in the story of our voyage from Elephant\r\nIsland than the younger generation was. They congratulated us on having\r\naccomplished a remarkable boat journey. I do not wish to belittle our\r\nsuccess with the pride that apes humility. Under Providence we had\r\novercome great difficulties and dangers, and it was pleasant to tell\r\nthe tale to men who knew those sullen and treacherous southern seas.\r\n\r\nMcCarthy, McNeish, and Vincent had been landed on the Monday afternoon.\r\nThey were already showing some signs of increasing strength under a\r\nregime of warm quarters and abundant food. The carpenter looked\r\nwoefully thin after he had emerged from a bath. He must have worn a lot\r\nof clothes when he landed from the boat, and I did not realize how he\r\nhad wasted till I saw him washed and changed. He was a man over fifty\r\nyears of age, and the strain had told upon him more than upon the rest\r\nof us. The rescue came just in time for him.\r\n\r\nThe early part of the voyage down to Elephant Island in the _Southern\r\nSky_ was uneventful. At noon on Tuesday, May 23, we were at sea and\r\nsteaming at ten knots on a south-westerly course. We made good\r\nprogress, but the temperature fell very low, and the signs gave me some\r\ncause for anxiety as to the probability of encountering ice. On the\r\nthird night out the sea seemed to grow silent. I looked over the side\r\nand saw a thin film of ice. The sea was freezing around us and the ice\r\ngradually grew thicker, reducing our speed to about five knots. Then\r\nlumps of old pack began to appear among the new ice. I realized that an\r\nadvance through pack-ice was out of the question. The _Southern Sky_\r\nwas a steel-built steamer, and her structure, while strong to resist\r\nthe waves, would not endure the blows of masses of ice. So I took the\r\nship north, and at daylight on Friday we got clear of the pancake-ice.\r\nWe skirted westward, awaiting favourable conditions. The morning of the\r\n28th was dull and overcast, with little wind. Again the ship’s head was\r\nturned to the south-west, but at 3 p.m. a definite line of pack showed\r\nup on the horizon. We were about 70 miles from Elephant Island, but\r\nthere was no possibility of taking the steamer through the ice that\r\nbarred the way. North-west again we turned. We were directly north of\r\nthe island on the following day, and I made another move south. Heavy\r\npack formed an impenetrable barrier.\r\n\r\nTo admit failure at this stage was hard, but the facts had to be faced.\r\nThe _Southern Sky_ could not enter ice of even moderate thickness. The\r\nseason was late, and we could not be sure that the ice would open for\r\nmany months, though my opinion was that the pack would not become fast\r\nin that quarter even in the winter, owing to the strong winds and\r\ncurrents. The _Southern Sky_ could carry coal for ten days only, and we\r\nhad been out six days. We were 500 miles from the Falkland Islands and\r\nabout 600 miles from South Georgia. So I determined that, since we\r\ncould not wait about for an opening, I would proceed to the Falklands,\r\nget a more suitable vessel either locally or from England, and make a\r\nsecond attempt to reach Elephant Island from that point.\r\n\r\nWe encountered very bad weather on the way up, but in the early\r\nafternoon of May 31 we arrived at Port Stanley, where the cable\r\nprovided a link with the outer world. The harbour-master came out to\r\nmeet us, and after we had dropped anchor I went ashore and met the\r\nGovernor, Mr. Douglas Young. He offered me his assistance at once. He\r\ntelephoned to Mr. Harding, the manager of the Falkland Islands station,\r\nand I learned, to my keen regret, that no ship of the type required was\r\navailable at the islands. That evening I cabled to London a message to\r\nHis Majesty the King, the first account of the loss of the _Endurance_\r\nand the subsequent adventures of the Expedition. The next day I\r\nreceived the following message from the King:\r\n\r\n“Rejoice to hear of your safe arrival in the Falkland Islands and trust\r\nyour comrades on Elephant Island may soon be rescued.\r\n\r\n\r\n“GEORGE R.I.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe events of the days that followed our arrival at the Falkland\r\nIslands I will not attempt to describe in detail. My mind was bent upon\r\nthe rescue of the party on Elephant Island at the earliest possible\r\nmoment. Winter was advancing, and I was fully conscious that the lives\r\nof some of my comrades might be the price of unnecessary delay. A\r\nproposal had been made to send a relief ship from England, but she\r\ncould not reach the southern seas for many weeks. In the meantime I got\r\ninto communication with the Governments of the South American Republics\r\nby wireless and cable and asked if they had any suitable ship I could\r\nuse for a rescue. I wanted a wooden ship capable of pushing into loose\r\nice, with fair speed and a reasonable coal capacity. Messages of\r\ncongratulation and goodwill were reaching me from all parts of the\r\nworld, and the kindness of hundreds of friends in many lands was a very\r\nreal comfort in a time of anxiety and stress.\r\n\r\nThe British Admiralty informed me that no suitable vessel was available\r\nin England and that no relief could be expected before October. I\r\nreplied that October would be too late. Then the British Minister in\r\nMontevideo telegraphed me regarding a trawler named _Instituto de Pesca\r\nNo. 1_, belonging to the Uruguayan Government. She was a stout little\r\nvessel, and the Government had generously offered to equip her with\r\ncoal, provisions, clothing, etc., and send her across to the Falkland\r\nIslands for me to take down to Elephant Island. I accepted this offer\r\ngladly, and the trawler was in Port Stanley on June 10. We started\r\nsouth at once.\r\n\r\nThe weather was bad but the trawler made good progress, steaming\r\nsteadily at about six knots, and in the bright, clear dawn of the third\r\nday we sighted the peaks of Elephant Island. Hope ran high; but our\r\nancient enemy the pack was lying in wait, and within twenty miles of\r\nthe island the trawler was stopped by an impenetrable barrier of ice.\r\nThe pack lay in the form of a crescent, with a horn to the west of the\r\nship stretching north. Steaming north-east, we reached another horn and\r\nsaw that the pack, heavy and dense, then trended away to the east. We\r\nmade an attempt to push into the ice, but it was so heavy that the\r\ntrawler was held up at once and began to grind in the small thick\r\nfloes, so we cautiously backed out. The propeller, going slowly, was\r\nnot damaged, though any moment I feared we might strip the blades. The\r\nisland lay on our starboard quarter, but there was no possibility of\r\napproaching it. The Uruguayan engineer reported to me that he had three\r\ndays’ coal left, and I had to give the order to turn back. A screen of\r\nfog hid the lower slopes of the island, and the men watching from the\r\ncamp on the beach could not have seen the ship. Northward we steamed\r\nagain, with the engines knocking badly, and after encountering a new\r\ngale, made Port Stanley with the bunkers nearly empty and the engines\r\nalmost broken down. H.M.S. _Glasgow_ was in the port, and the British\r\nsailors gave us a hearty welcome as we steamed in.\r\n\r\nThe Uruguayan Government offered to send the trawler to Punta Arenas\r\nand have her dry-docked there and made ready for another effort. One of\r\nthe troubles on the voyage was that according to estimate the trawler\r\ncould do ten knots on six tons of coal a day, which would have given us\r\na good margin to allow for lying off the ice; but in reality, owing to\r\nthe fact that she had not been in dock for a year, she only developed a\r\nspeed of six knots on a consumption of ten tons a day. Time was\r\nprecious and these preparations would have taken too long. I thanked\r\nthe Government then for its very generous offer, and I want to say now\r\nthat the kindness of the Uruguayans at this time earned my warmest\r\ngratitude. I ought to mention also the assistance given me by Lieut.\r\nRyan, a Naval Reserve officer who navigated the trawler to the\r\nFalklands and came south on the attempt at relief. The _Instituto de\r\nPesca_ went off to Montevideo and I looked around for another ship.\r\n\r\nA British mail-boat, the _Orita_ called at Port Stanley opportunely,\r\nand I boarded her with Worsley and Crean and crossed to Punta Arenas in\r\nthe Magellan Straits. The reception we received there was heartening.\r\nThe members of the British Association of Magellanes took us to their\r\nhearts. Mr. Allan McDonald was especially prominent in his untiring\r\nefforts to assist in the rescue of our twenty-two companions on\r\nElephant Island. He worked day and night, and it was mainly due to him\r\nthat within three days they had raised a sum of £1500 amongst\r\nthemselves, chartered the schooner _Emma_ and equipped her for our use.\r\nShe was a forty-year-old oak schooner, strong and seaworthy, with an\r\nauxiliary oil-engine.\r\n\r\nOut of the complement of ten men all told who were manning the ship,\r\nthere were eight different nationalities; but they were all good\r\nfellows and understood perfectly what was wanted. The Chilian\r\nGovernment lent us a small steamer, the _Yelcho_, to tow us part of the\r\nway. She could not touch ice, though, as she was built of steel.\r\nHowever, on July 12 we passed her our tow-rope and proceeded on our\r\nway. In bad weather we anchored next day, and although the wind\r\nincreased to a gale I could delay no longer, so we hove up anchor in\r\nthe early morning of the 14th. The strain on the tow-rope was too\r\ngreat. With the crack of a gun the rope broke. Next day the gale\r\ncontinued, and I will quote from the log of the _Emma_, which Worsley\r\nkept as navigating officer.\r\n\r\n“9 a.m.—Fresh, increasing gale; very rough, lumpy sea. 10 a.m.—Tow-rope\r\nparted. 12 noon. Similar weather. 1 p.m.—Tow-rope parted again. Set\r\nforesail and forestay-sail and steered south-east by south. 3\r\np.m.—_Yelcho_ hailed us and said that the ship’s bilges were full of\r\nwater (so were our decks) and they were short of coal. Sir Ernest told\r\nthem that they could return to harbour. After this the _Yelcho_ steamed\r\ninto San Sebastian Bay.”\r\n\r\nAfter three days of continuous bad weather we were left alone to\r\nattempt once more to rescue the twenty-two men on Elephant Island, for\r\nwhom by this time I entertained very grave fears.\r\n\r\nAt dawn of Friday, July 21, we were within a hundred miles of the\r\nisland, and we encountered the ice in the half-light. I waited for the\r\nfull day and then tried to push through. The little craft was tossing\r\nin the heavy swell, and before she had been in the pack for ten minutes\r\nshe came down on a cake of ice and broke the bobstay. Then the\r\nwater-inlet of the motor choked with ice. The schooner was tossing like\r\na cork in the swell, and I saw after a few bumps that she was actually\r\nlighter than the fragments of ice around her. Progress under such\r\nconditions was out of the question. I worked the schooner out of the\r\npack and stood to the east. I ran her through a line of pack towards\r\nthe south that night, but was forced to turn to the north-east, for the\r\nice trended in that direction as far as I could see. We hove to for the\r\nnight, which was now sixteen hours long. The winter was well advanced\r\nand the weather conditions were thoroughly bad. The ice to the\r\nsouthward was moving north rapidly. The motor-engine had broken down\r\nand we were entirely dependent on the sails. We managed to make a\r\nlittle southing during the next day, but noon found us 108 miles from\r\nthe island. That night we lay off the ice in a gale, hove to, and\r\nmorning found the schooner iced up. The ropes, cased in frozen spray,\r\nwere as thick as a man’s arm, and if the wind had increased much we\r\nwould have had to cut away the sails, since there was no possibility of\r\nlowering them. Some members of the scratch crew were played out by the\r\ncold and the violent tossing. The schooner was about seventy feet long,\r\nand she responded to the motions of the storm-racked sea in a manner\r\nthat might have disconcerted the most seasoned sailors.\r\n\r\nI took the schooner south at every chance, but always the line of ice\r\nblocked the way. The engineer, who happened to be an American, did\r\nthings to the engines occasionally, but he could not keep them running,\r\nand, the persistent south winds were dead ahead. It was hard to turn\r\nback a third time, but I realized we could not reach the island under\r\nthose conditions, and we must turn north in order to clear the ship of\r\nheavy masses of ice. So we set a northerly course, and after a\r\ntempestuous passage reached Port Stanley once more. This was the third\r\nreverse, but I did not abandon my belief that the ice would not remain\r\nfast around Elephant Island during the winter, whatever the arm-chair\r\nexperts at home might say. We reached Port Stanley in the schooner on\r\nAugust 8, and I learned there that the ship _Discovery_ was to leave\r\nEngland at once and would be at the Falkland Islands about the middle\r\nof September. My good friend the Governor said I could settle down at\r\nPort Stanley and take things quietly for a few weeks. The street of\r\nthat port is about a mile and a half long. It has the slaughter-house\r\nat one end and the graveyard at the other. The chief distraction is to\r\nwalk from the slaughter-house to the graveyard. For a change one may\r\nwalk from the graveyard to the slaughter-house. Ellaline Terriss was\r\nborn at Port Stanley—a fact not forgotten by the residents, but she has\r\nnot lived there much since. I could not content myself to wait for six\r\nor seven weeks, knowing that six hundred miles away my comrades were in\r\ndire need. I asked the Chilian Government to send the _Yelcho_, the\r\nsteamer that had towed us before, to take the schooner across to Punta\r\nArenas, and they consented promptly, as they had done to every other\r\nrequest of mine. So in a north-west gale we went across, narrowly\r\nescaping disaster on the way, and reached Punta Arenas on August 14.\r\n\r\nThere was no suitable ship to be obtained. The weather was showing some\r\nsigns of improvement, and I begged the Chilian Government to let me\r\nhave the _Yelcho_ for a last attempt to reach the island. She was a\r\nsmall steel-built steamer, quite unsuitable for work in the pack, but I\r\npromised that I would not touch the ice. The Government was willing to\r\ngive me another chance, and on August 25 I started south on the fourth\r\nattempt at relief. This time Providence favoured us. The little steamer\r\nmade a quick run down in comparatively fine weather, and I found as we\r\nneared Elephant Island that the ice was open. A southerly gale had sent\r\nit northward temporarily, and the _Yelcho_ had her chance to slip\r\nthrough. We approached the island in a thick fog. I did not dare to\r\nwait for this to clear, and at 10 a.m. on August 30 we passed some\r\nstranded bergs. Then we saw the sea breaking on a reef, and I knew that\r\nwe were just outside the island. It was an anxious moment, for we had\r\nstill to locate the camp and the pack could not be trusted to allow\r\ntime for a prolonged search in thick weather; but presently the fog\r\nlifted and revealed the cliffs and glaciers of Elephant Island. I\r\nproceeded to the east, and at 11.40 a.m. Worsley’s keen eyes detected\r\nthe camp, almost invisible under its covering of snow. The men ashore\r\nsaw us at the same time, and we saw tiny black figures hurry to the\r\nbeach and wave signals to us. We were about a mile and a half away from\r\nthe camp. I turned the _Yelcho_ in, and within half an hour reached the\r\nbeach with Crean and some of the Chilian sailors. I saw a little figure\r\non a surf-beaten rock and recognized Wild. As I came nearer I called\r\nout, “Are you all well?” and he answered, “We are all well, boss,” and\r\nthen I heard three cheers. As I drew close to the rock I flung packets\r\nof cigarettes ashore; they fell on them like hungry tigers, for well I\r\nknew that for months tobacco was dreamed of and talked of. Some of the\r\nhands were in a rather bad way, but Wild had held the party together\r\nand kept hope alive in their hearts. There was no time then to exchange\r\nnews or congratulations. I did not even go up the beach to see the\r\ncamp, which Wild assured me had been much improved. A heavy sea was\r\nrunning and a change of wind might bring the ice back at any time. I\r\nhurried the party aboard with all possible speed, taking also the\r\nrecords of the Expedition and essential portions of equipment.\r\nEverybody was aboard the _Yelcho_ within an hour, and we steamed north\r\nat the little steamer’s best speed. The ice was open still, and nothing\r\nworse than an expanse of stormy ocean separated us from the South\r\nAmerican coast.\r\n\r\nDuring the run up to Punta Arenas I heard Wild’s story, and blessed\r\nagain the cheerfulness and resource that had served the party so well\r\nduring four and a half months of privation. The twenty-two men on\r\nElephant Island were just at the end of their resources when the\r\n_Yelcho_ reached them. Wild had husbanded the scanty stock of food as\r\nfar as possible and had fought off the devils of despondency and\r\ndespair on that little sand-spit, where the party had a precarious\r\nfoothold between the grim ice-fields and the treacherous, ice-strewn\r\nsea. The pack had opened occasionally, but much of the time the way to\r\nthe north had been barred. The _Yelcho_ had arrived at the right\r\nmoment. Two days earlier she could not have reached the island, and a\r\nfew hours later the pack may have been impenetrable again. Wild had\r\nreckoned that help would come in August, and every morning he had\r\npacked his kit, in cheerful anticipation that proved infectious, as I\r\nhave no doubt it was meant to be. One of the party to whom I had said\r\n“Well, you all were packed up ready,” replied, “You see, boss, Wild\r\nnever gave up hope, and whenever the sea was at all clear of ice he\r\nrolled up his sleeping-bag and said to all hands, ‘Roll up your\r\nsleeping-bags, boys; the boss may come to-day.’” And so it came to\r\npass that we suddenly came out of the fog, and, from a black outlook,\r\nin an hour all were in safety homeward bound. The food was eked out\r\nwith seal and penguin meat, limpets, and seaweed. Seals had been\r\nscarce, but the supply of penguins had held out fairly well during the\r\nfirst three months. The men were down to the last Bovril ration, the\r\nonly form of hot drink they had, and had scarcely four days’ food in\r\nhand at the time of the rescue. The camp was in constant danger of\r\nbeing buried by the snow, which drifted heavily from the heights\r\nbehind, and the men moved the accumulations with what implements they\r\ncould provide. There was danger that the camp would become completely\r\ninvisible from the sea, so that a rescue party might look for it in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\n“It had been arranged that a gun should be fired from the relief ship\r\nwhen she got near the island,” said Wild. “Many times when the glaciers\r\nwere ‘calving,’ and chunks fell off with a report like a gun, we\r\nthought that it was the real thing, and after a time we got to distrust\r\nthese signals. As a matter of fact, we saw the _Yelcho_ before we heard\r\nany gun. It was an occasion one will not easily forget. We were just\r\nassembling for lunch to the call of ‘Lunch O!’ and I was serving out\r\nthe soup, which was particularly good that day, consisting of boiled\r\nseal’s backbone, limpets, and seaweed, when there was another hail from\r\nMarston of ‘Ship O!’ Some of the men thought it was ‘Lunch O!’ over\r\nagain, but when there was another yell from Marston lunch had no\r\nfurther attractions. The ship was about a mile and a half away and\r\nsteaming past us. A smoke-signal was the agreed sign from the shore,\r\nand, catching up somebody’s coat that was lying about, I struck a pick\r\ninto a tin of kerosene kept for the purpose, poured it over the coat,\r\nand set it alight. It flared instead of smoking; but that didn’t\r\nmatter, for you had already recognized the spot where you had left us\r\nand the _Yelcho_ was turning in.”\r\n\r\nWe encountered bad weather on the way back to Punta Arenas, and the\r\nlittle _Yelcho_ laboured heavily; but she had light hearts aboard. We\r\nentered the Straits of Magellan on September 3 and reached Rio Secco at\r\n8 a.m. I went ashore, found a telephone, and told the Governor and my\r\nfriends at Punta Arenas that the men were safe. Two hours later we were\r\nat Punta Arenas, where we were given a welcome none of us is likely to\r\nforget. The Chilian people were no less enthusiastic than the British\r\nresidents. The police had been instructed to spread the news that the\r\n_Yelcho_ was coming with the rescued men, and lest the message should\r\nfail to reach some people, the fire-alarm had been rung. The whole\r\npopulace appeared to be in the streets. It was a great reception, and\r\nwith the strain of long, anxious months lifted at last, we were in a\r\nmood to enjoy it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arrival at Punta Arenas with the Rescued Men]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frank Wild, Second in Command of the Expedition]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next few weeks were crowded ones, but I will not attempt here to\r\nrecord their history in detail. I received congratulations and messages\r\nof friendship and good cheer from all over the world, and my heart went\r\nout to the good people who had remembered my men and myself in the\r\npress of terrible events on the battlefields. The Chilian Government\r\nplaced the _Yelcho_ at my disposal to take the men up to Valparaiso and\r\nSantiago. We reached Valparaiso on September 27. Everything that could\r\nswim in the way of a boat was out to meet us, the crews of Chilian\r\nwarships were lined up, and at least thirty thousand thronged the\r\nstreets. I lectured in Santiago on the following evening for the\r\nBritish Red Cross and a Chilian naval charity. The Chilian flag and the\r\nUnion Jack were draped together, the band played the Chilian national\r\nanthem, “God Save the King,” and the “Marseillaise,” and the Chilian\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs spoke from the platform and pinned an\r\nOrder on my coat. I saw the President and thanked him for the help that\r\nhe had given a British expedition. His Government had spent £4000 on\r\ncoal alone. In reply he recalled the part that British sailors had\r\ntaken in the making of the Chilian Navy.\r\n\r\nThe Chilian Railway Department provided a special train to take us\r\nacross the Andes, and I proceeded to Montevideo in order to thank\r\npersonally the President and Government of Uruguay for the help they\r\nhad given generously in the earlier relief voyages. We were entertained\r\nroyally at various spots _en route_. We went also to Buenos Ayres on a\r\nbrief call. Then we crossed the Andes again. I had made arrangements by\r\nthis time for the men and the staff to go to England. All hands were\r\nkeen to take their places in the Empire’s fighting forces. My own\r\nimmediate task was the relief of the marooned Ross Sea party, for news\r\nhad come to me of the _Aurora’s_ long drift in the Ross Sea and of her\r\nreturn in a damaged condition to New Zealand. Worsley was to come with\r\nme. We hurried northwards via Panama, steamship and train companies\r\ngiving us everywhere the most cordial and generous assistance, and\r\ncaught at San Francisco a steamer that would get us to New Zealand at\r\nthe end of November. I had been informed that the New Zealand\r\nGovernment was making arrangements for the relief of the Ross Sea\r\nparty, but my information was incomplete, and I was very anxious to be\r\non the spot myself as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\nELEPHANT ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe twenty-two men who had been left behind on Elephant Island were\r\nunder the command of Wild, in whom I had absolute confidence, and the\r\naccount of their experiences during the long four and a half months’\r\nwait while I was trying to get help to them, I have secured from their\r\nvarious diaries, supplemented by details which I obtained in\r\nconversation on the voyage back to civilization.\r\n\r\nThe first consideration, which was even more important than that of\r\nfood, was to provide shelter. The semi-starvation during the drift on\r\nthe ice-floe, added to the exposure in the boats, and the inclemencies\r\nof the weather encountered after our landing on Elephant Island, had\r\nleft its mark on a good many of them. Rickenson, who bore up gamely to\r\nthe last, collapsed from heart-failure. Blackborrow and Hudson could\r\nnot move. All were frost-bitten in varying degrees and their clothes,\r\nwhich had been worn continuously for six months, were much the worse\r\nfor wear. The blizzard which sprang up the day that we landed at Cape\r\nWild lasted for a fortnight, often blowing at the rate of seventy to\r\nninety miles an hour, and occasionally reaching even higher figures.\r\nThe tents which had lasted so well and endured so much were torn to\r\nribbons, with the exception of the square tent occupied by Hurley,\r\nJames, and Hudson. Sleeping-bags and clothes were wringing wet, and the\r\nphysical discomforts were tending to produce acute mental depression.\r\nThe two remaining boats had been turned upside down with one gunwale\r\nresting on the snow, and the other raised about two feet on rocks and\r\ncases, and under these the sailors and some of the scientists, with the\r\ntwo invalids, Rickenson and Blackborrow, found head-cover at least.\r\nShelter from the weather and warmth to dry their clothes was\r\nimperative, so Wild hastened the excavation of the ice-cave in the\r\nslope which had been started before I left.\r\n\r\nThe high temperature, however, caused a continuous stream of water to\r\ndrip from the roof and sides of the ice-cave, and as with twenty-two\r\nmen living in it the temperature would be practically always above\r\nfreezing, there would have been no hope of dry quarters for them there.\r\nUnder the direction of Wild they, therefore, collected some big flat\r\nstones, having in many cases to dig down under the snow which was\r\ncovering the beach, and with these they erected two substantial walls\r\nfour feet high and nineteen feet apart.\r\n\r\n“We are all ridiculously weak, and this part of the work was\r\nexceedingly laborious and took us more than twice as long as it would\r\nhave done had we been in normal health. Stones that we could easily\r\nhave lifted at other times we found quite beyond our capacity, and it\r\nneeded two or three of us to carry some that would otherwise have been\r\none man’s load. Our difficulties were added to by the fact that most of\r\nthe more suitable stones lay at the farther end of the spit, some one\r\nhundred and fifty yards away. Our weakness is best compared with that\r\nwhich one experiences on getting up from a long illness; one ‘feels’\r\nwell, but physically enervated.\r\n\r\n“The site chosen for the hut was the spot where the stove had been\r\noriginally erected on the night of our arrival. It lay between two\r\nlarge boulders, which, if they would not actually form the walls of the\r\nhut, would at least provide a valuable protection from the wind.\r\nFurther protection was provided to the north by a hill called Penguin\r\nHill at the end of the spit. As soon as the walls were completed and\r\nsquared off, the two boats were laid upside down on them side by side.\r\nThe exact adjustment of the boats took some time, but was of paramount\r\nimportance if our structure was to be the permanent affair that we\r\nhoped it would be. Once in place they were securely chocked up and\r\nlashed down to the rocks. The few pieces of wood that we had were laid\r\nacross from keel to keel, and over this the material of one of the torn\r\ntents was spread and secured with guys to the rocks. The walls were\r\ningeniously contrived and fixed up by Marston. First he cut the now\r\nuseless tents into suitable lengths; then he cut the legs of a pair of\r\nseaboots into narrow strips, and using these in much the same way that\r\nthe leather binding is put round the edge of upholstered chairs, he\r\nnailed the tent-cloth all round the insides of the outer gunwales of\r\nthe two boats in such a way that it hung down like a valance to the\r\nground, where it was secured with spars and oars. A couple of\r\noverlapping blankets made the door, superseded later by a sack-mouth\r\ndoor cut from one of the tents. This consisted of a sort of tube of\r\ncanvas sewn on to the tent-cloth, through which the men crawled in or\r\nout, tying it up as one would the mouth of a sack as soon as the man\r\nhad passed through. It is certainly the most convenient and efficient\r\ndoor for these conditions that has ever been invented.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Our Dugout]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Hut on Elephant Island]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Whilst the side walls of the hut were being fixed, others proceeded to\r\nfill the interstices between the stones of the end walls with snow. As\r\nthis was very powdery and would not bind well, we eventually had to\r\nsupplement it with the only spare blanket and an overcoat. All this\r\nwork was very hard on our frost-bitten fingers, and materials were very\r\nlimited.\r\n\r\n“At last all was completed and we were invited to bring in our sodden\r\nbags, which had been lying out in the drizzling rain for several hours;\r\nfor the tents and boats that had previously sheltered them had all been\r\nrequisitioned to form our new residence.\r\n\r\n“We took our places under Wild’s direction. There was no squabbling for\r\nbest places, but it was noticeable that there was something in the\r\nnature of a rush for the billets up on the thwarts of the boats.\r\n\r\n“Rickenson, who was still very weak and ill, but very cheery, obtained\r\na place in the boat directly above the stove, and the sailors having\r\nlived under the _Stancomb Wills_ for a few days while she was upside\r\ndown on the beach, tacitly claimed it as their own, and flocked up on\r\nto its thwarts as one man. There was one ‘upstair’ billet left in this\r\nboat, which Wild offered to Hussey and Lees simultaneously, saying that\r\nthe first man that got his bag up could have the billet. Whilst Lees\r\nwas calculating the pros and cons Hussey got his bag, and had it up\r\njust as Lees had determined that the pros had it. There were now four\r\nmen up on the thwarts of the _Dudley Docker_, and the five sailors and\r\nHussey on those of the _Stancomb Wills_, the remainder disposing\r\nthemselves on the floor.”\r\n\r\nThe floor was at first covered with snow and ice, frozen in amongst the\r\npebbles. This was cleared out, and the remainder of the tents spread\r\nout over the stones. Within the shelter of these cramped but\r\ncomparatively palatial quarters cheerfulness once more reigned amongst\r\nthe party. The blizzard, however, soon discovered the flaws in the\r\narchitecture of their hut, and the fine drift-snow forced its way\r\nthrough the crevices between the stones forming the end walls. Jaeger\r\nsleeping-bags and coats were spread over the outside of these walls,\r\npacked over with snow and securely frozen up, effectively keeping out\r\nthis drift.\r\n\r\nAt first all the cooking was done outside under the lee of some rocks,\r\nfurther protection being provided by a wall of provision-cases. There\r\nwere two blubber-stoves made from old oil-drums, and one day, when the\r\nblizzard was unusually severe, an attempt was made to cook the meals\r\ninside the hut. There being no means of escape for the pungent\r\nblubber-smoke, the inmates had rather a bad time, some being affected\r\nwith a form of smoke-blindness similar to snow-blindness, very painful\r\nand requiring medical attention.\r\n\r\nA chimney was soon fitted, made by Kerr out of the tin lining of one of\r\nthe biscuit-cases, and passed through a close-fitting tin grummet sewn\r\ninto the canvas of the roof just between the keels of the two boats,\r\nand the smoke nuisance was soon a thing of the past. Later on, another\r\nold oil-drum was made to surround this chimney, so that two pots could\r\nbe cooked at once on the one stove. Those whose billets were near the\r\nstove suffered from the effects of the local thaw caused by its heat,\r\nbut they were repaid by being able to warm up portions of steak and\r\nhooshes left over from previous meals, and even to warm up those of the\r\nless fortunate ones, for a consideration. This consisted generally of\r\npart of the hoosh or one or two pieces of sugar.\r\n\r\nThe cook and his assistant, which latter job was taken by each man in\r\nturn, were called about 7 a.m., and breakfast was generally ready by\r\nabout 10 a.m.\r\n\r\nProvision-cases were then arranged in a wide circle round the stove,\r\nand those who were fortunate enough to be next to it could dry their\r\ngear. So that all should benefit equally by this, a sort of “General\r\nPost” was carried out, each man occupying his place at meal-times for\r\none day only, moving up one the succeeding day. In this way eventually\r\nevery man managed to dry his clothes, and life began to assume a much\r\nbrighter aspect.\r\n\r\nThe great trouble in the hut was the absence of light. The canvas walls\r\nwere covered with blubber-soot, and with the snowdrifts accumulating\r\nround the hut its inhabitants were living in a state of perpetual\r\nnight. Lamps were fashioned out of sardine-tins, with bits of surgical\r\nbandage for wicks; but as the oil consisted of seal-oil rendered down\r\nfrom the blubber, the remaining fibrous tissue being issued very\r\nsparingly at lunch, by the by, and being considered a great delicacy,\r\nthey were more a means of conserving the scanty store of matches than\r\nof serving as illuminants.\r\n\r\nWild was the first to overcome this difficulty by sewing into the\r\ncanvas wall the glass lid of a chronometer box. Later on three other\r\nwindows were added, the material in this case being some celluloid\r\npanels from a photograph case of mine which I had left behind in a bag.\r\nThis enabled the occupants of the floor billets who were near enough to\r\nread and sew, which relieved the monotony of the situation\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\n“Our reading material consisted at this time of two books of poetry,\r\none book of ‘Nordenskjold’s Expedition,’ one or two torn volumes of the\r\n‘Encyclopædia Britannica,’ and a penny cookery book, owned by Marston.\r\nOur clothes, though never presentable, as they bore the scars of nearly\r\nten months of rough usage, had to be continually patched to keep them\r\ntogether at all.”\r\n\r\nAs the floor of the hut had been raised by the addition of loads of\r\nclean pebbles, from which most of the snow had been removed, during the\r\ncold weather it was kept comparatively dry. When, however, the\r\ntemperature rose to just above freezing-point, as occasionally\r\nhappened, the hut became the drainage-pool of all the surrounding\r\nhills. Wild was the first to notice it by remarking one morning that\r\nhis sleeping-bag was practically afloat. Other men examined theirs with\r\na like result, so baling operations commenced forthwith. Stones were\r\nremoved from the floor and a large hole dug, and in its gloomy depths\r\nthe water could be seen rapidly rising. Using a saucepan for a baler,\r\nthey baled out over 100 gallons of dirty water. The next day 150\r\ngallons were removed, the men taking it in turns to bale at intervals\r\nduring the night; 160 more gallons were baled out during the next\r\ntwenty-four hours, till one man rather pathetically remarked in his\r\ndiary, “This is what nice, mild, high temperatures mean to us: no\r\nwonder we prefer the cold.” Eventually, by removing a portion of one\r\nwall a long channel was dug nearly down to the sea, completely solving\r\nthe problem. Additional precautions were taken by digging away the snow\r\nwhich surrounded the hut after each blizzard, sometimes entirely\r\nobscuring it.\r\n\r\nA huge glacier across the bay behind the hut nearly put an end to the\r\nparty. Enormous blocks of ice weighing many tons would break off and\r\nfall into the sea, the disturbance thus caused giving rise to great\r\nwaves. One day Marston was outside the hut digging up the frozen seal\r\nfor lunch with a pick, when a noise “like an artillery barrage”\r\nstartled him. Looking up he saw that one of these tremendous waves,\r\nover thirty feet high, was advancing rapidly across the bay,\r\nthreatening to sweep hut and inhabitants into the sea. A hastily\r\nshouted warning brought the men tumbling out, but fortunately the loose\r\nice which filled the bay damped the wave down so much that, though it\r\nflowed right under the hut, nothing was carried away. It was a narrow\r\nescape, though, as had they been washed into the sea nothing could have\r\nsaved them.\r\n\r\nAlthough they themselves gradually became accustomed to the darkness\r\nand the dirt, some entries in their diaries show that occasionally they\r\ncould realize the conditions under which they were living.\r\n\r\n“The hut grows more grimy every day. Everything is a sooty black. We\r\nhave arrived at the limit where further increments from the smoking\r\nstove, blubber-lamps, and cooking-gear are unnoticed. It is at least\r\ncomforting to feel that we can become no filthier. Our shingle floor\r\nwill scarcely bear examination by strong light without causing even us\r\nto shudder and express our disapprobation at its state. Oil mixed with\r\nreindeer hair, bits of meat, sennegrass, and penguin feathers form a\r\nconglomeration which cements the stones together. From time to time we\r\nhave a spring cleaning, but a fresh supply of flooring material is not\r\nalways available, as all the shingle is frozen up and buried by deep\r\nrifts. Such is our Home Sweet Home.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View of Interior of Hut on Elephant Island]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marooned on Elephant Island]\r\n\r\n\r\n“All joints are aching through being compelled to lie on the hard,\r\nrubbly floor which forms our bedsteads.”\r\n\r\nAgain, later on, one writes: “Now that Wild’s window allows a shaft of\r\nlight to enter our hut, one can begin to ‘see’ things inside.\r\nPreviously one relied upon one’s sense of touch, assisted by the\r\nremarks from those whose faces were inadvertently trodden on, to guide\r\none to the door. Looking down in the semi-darkness to the far end, one\r\nobserves two very small smoky flares that dimly illuminate a row of\r\nfive, endeavouring to make time pass by reading or argument. These are\r\nMacklin, Kerr, Wordie, Hudson, and Blackborrow—the last two being\r\ninvalids.\r\n\r\n“The centre of the hut is filled with the cases which do duty for the\r\ncook’s bed, the meat and blubber boxes, and a mummified-looking object,\r\nwhich is Lees in his sleeping-bag. The near end of the floor space is\r\ntaken up with the stove, with Wild and McIlroy on one side, and Hurley\r\nand James on the other. Marston occupies a hammock most of the\r\nnight—and day—which is slung across the entrance. As he is large and\r\nthe entrance very small, he invariably gets bumped by those passing in\r\nand out. His vocabulary at such times is interesting.\r\n\r\n“In the attic, formed by the two upturned boats, live ten unkempt and\r\ncareless lodgers, who drop boots, mitts, and other articles of apparel\r\non to the men below. Reindeer hairs rain down incessantly day and\r\nnight, with every movement that they make in their moulting bags.\r\nThese, with penguin feathers and a little grit from the floor,\r\noccasionally savour the hooshes. Thank heaven man is an adaptable\r\nbrute! If we dwell sufficiently long in this hut, we are likely to\r\nalter our method of walking, for our ceiling, which is but four feet\r\nsix inches high at its highest part, compels us to walk bent double or\r\non all fours.\r\n\r\n“Our doorway—Cheetham is just crawling in now, bringing a shower of\r\nsnow with him—was originally a tent entrance. When one wishes to go\r\nout, one unties the cord securing the door, and crawls or wriggles out,\r\nat the same time exclaiming ‘Thank goodness I’m in the open air!’ This\r\nshould suffice to describe the atmosphere inside the hut, only pleasant\r\nwhen charged with the overpowering yet appetizing smell of burning\r\npenguin steaks.\r\n\r\n“From all parts there dangles an odd collection of blubbery garments,\r\nhung up to dry, through which one crawls, much as a chicken in an\r\nincubator. Our walls of tent-canvas admit as much light as might be\r\nexpected from a closed Venetian blind. It is astonishing how we have\r\ngrown accustomed to inconveniences, and tolerate, at least, habits\r\nwhich a little time back were regarded with repugnance. We have no\r\nforks, but each man has a sheath-knife and a spoon, the latter in many\r\ncases having been fashioned from a piece of box lid. The knife serves\r\nmany purposes. With it we kill, skin, and cut up seals and penguins,\r\ncut blubber into strips for the fire, very carefully scrape the snow\r\noff our hut walls, and then after a perfunctory rub with an oily\r\npenguin-skin, use it at meals. We are as regardless of our grime and\r\ndirt as is the Esquimaux. We have been unable to wash since we left the\r\nship, nearly ten months ago. For one thing we have no soap or towels,\r\nonly bare necessities being brought with us; and, again, had we\r\npossessed these articles, our supply of fuel would only permit us to\r\nmelt enough ice for drinking purposes. Had one man washed, half a dozen\r\nothers would have had to go without a drink all day. One cannot suck\r\nice to relieve the thirst, as at these low temperatures it cracks the\r\nlips and blisters the tongue. Still, we are all very cheerful.”\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of their stay on Elephant Island the weather was\r\ndescribed by Wild as “simply appalling.” Stranded as they were on a\r\nnarrow, sandy beach surrounded by high mountains, they saw little of\r\nthe scanty sunshine during the brief intervals of clear sky. On most\r\ndays the air was full of snowdrift blown from the adjacent heights.\r\nElephant Island being practically on the outside edge of the pack, the\r\nwinds which passed over the relatively warm ocean before reaching it\r\nclothed it in a “constant pall of fog and snow.”\r\n\r\nOn April 25, the day after I left for South Georgia, the island was\r\nbeset by heavy pack-ice, with snow and a wet mist. Next day was calmer,\r\nbut on the 27th, to quote one of the diaries, they experienced “the\r\nmost wretched weather conceivable. Raining all night and day, and\r\nblowing hard. Wet to the skin.” The following day brought heavy fog and\r\nsleet, and a continuance of the blizzard. April ended with a terrific\r\nwindstorm which nearly destroyed the hut. The one remaining tent had to\r\nbe dismantled, the pole taken down, and the inhabitants had to lie flat\r\nall night under the icy canvas. This lasted well into May, and a\r\ntypical May day is described as follows: “A day of terrific winds,\r\nthreatening to dislodge our shelter. The wind is a succession of\r\nhurricane gusts that sweep down the glacier immediately\r\nsouth-south-west of us. Each gust heralds its approach by a low\r\nrumbling which increases to a thunderous roar. Snow, stones, and gravel\r\nare flying about, and any gear left unweighted by very heavy stones is\r\ncarried away to sea.”\r\n\r\nHeavy bales of sennegrass, and boxes of cooking-gear, were lifted\r\nbodily in the air and carried away out of sight. Once the wind carried\r\noff the floor-cloth of a tent which six men were holding on to and\r\nshaking the snow off. These gusts often came with alarming suddenness;\r\nand without any warning. Hussey was outside in the blizzard digging up\r\nthe day’s meat, which had frozen to the ground, when a gust caught him\r\nand drove him down the spit towards the sea. Fortunately, when he\r\nreached the softer sand and shingle below high-water mark, he managed\r\nto stick his pick into the ground and hold on with both hands till the\r\nsquall had passed.\r\n\r\nOn one or two rare occasions they had fine, calm, clear days. The glow\r\nof the dying sun on the mountains and glaciers filled even the most\r\nmaterialistic of them with wonder and admiration. These days were\r\nsometimes succeeded by calm, clear nights, when, but for the cold, they\r\nwould have stayed out on the sandy beach all night.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of May a terrific blizzard sprang up, blowing from\r\nsixty to ninety miles an hour, and Wild entertained grave fears for\r\ntheir hut. One curious feature noted in this blizzard was the fact that\r\nhuge ice-sheets as big as window-panes, and about a quarter of an inch\r\nthick, were being hurled about by the wind, making it as dangerous to\r\nwalk about outside as if one were in an avalanche of splintered glass.\r\nStill, these winds from the south and south-west, though invariably\r\naccompanied by snow and low temperatures, were welcome in that they\r\ndrove the pack-ice away from the immediate vicinity of the island, and\r\nso gave rise on each occasion to hopes of relief. North-east winds, on\r\nthe other hand, by filling the bays with ice and bringing thick misty\r\nweather, made it impossible to hope for any ship to approach them.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of May a period of dead calm set in, with ice closely\r\npacked all round the island. This gave place to north-east winds and\r\nmist, and at the beginning of June came another south-west blizzard,\r\nwith cold driving snow. “The blizzard increased to terrific gusts\r\nduring the night, causing us much anxiety for the safety of our hut.\r\nThere was little sleep, all being apprehensive of the canvas roof\r\nripping off, and the boats being blown out to sea.”\r\n\r\nThus it continued, alternating between south-west blizzards, when they\r\nwere all confined to the hut, and north-east winds bringing cold, damp,\r\nmisty weather.\r\n\r\nOn June 25 a severe storm from north-west was recorded, accompanied by\r\nstrong winds and heavy seas, which encroached upon their little sandy\r\nbeach up to within four yards of their hut.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of July and the beginning of August they had a few\r\nfine, calm, clear days. Occasional glimpses of the sun, with high\r\ntemperatures, were experienced, after south-west winds had blown all\r\nthe ice away, and the party, their spirits cheered by Wild’s unfailing\r\noptimism, again began to look eagerly for the rescue ship.\r\n\r\nThe first three attempts at their rescue unfortunately coincided with\r\nthe times when the island was beset with ice, and though on the second\r\noccasion we approached close enough to fire a gun, in the hope that\r\nthey would hear the sound and know that we were safe and well, yet so\r\naccustomed were they to the noise made by the calving of the adjacent\r\nglacier that either they did not hear or the sound passed unnoticed. On\r\nAugust 16 pack was observed on the horizon, and next day the bay was\r\nfilled with loose ice, which soon consolidated. Soon afterwards huge\r\nold floes and many bergs drifted in. “The pack appears as dense as we\r\nhave ever seen it. No open water is visible, and ‘ice-blink’ girdles\r\nthe horizon. The weather is wretched—a stagnant calm of air and ocean\r\nalike, the latter obscured by dense pack through which no swell can\r\npenetrate, and a wet mist hangs like a pall over land and sea. The\r\nsilence is oppressive. There is nothing to do but to stay in one’s\r\nsleeping-bag, or else wander in the soft snow and become thoroughly\r\nwet.” Fifteen inches of snow fell in the next twenty-four hours, making\r\nover two feet between August 18 and 21. A slight swell next day from\r\nthe north-east ground up the pack-ice, but this soon subsided, and the\r\npack became consolidated once more. On August 27 a strong\r\nwest-south-west wind sprang up and drove all this ice out of the bay,\r\nand except for some stranded bergs left a clear ice-free sea through\r\nwhich we finally made our way from Punta Arenas to Elephant Island.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had left the island to get help for the rest of the\r\nExpedition, Wild set all hands to collect as many seals and penguins as\r\npossible, in case their stay was longer than was at first anticipated.\r\nA sudden rise in temperature caused a whole lot to go bad and become\r\nunfit for food, so while a fair reserve was kept in hand too much was\r\nnot accumulated.\r\n\r\nAt first the meals, consisting mostly of seal meat with one hot drink\r\nper day, were cooked on a stove in the open. The snow and wind, besides\r\nmaking it very unpleasant for the cook, filled all the cooking-pots\r\nwith sand and grit, so during the winter the cooking was done inside\r\nthe hut.\r\n\r\nA little Cerebos salt had been saved, and this was issued out at the\r\nrate of three-quarters of an ounce per man per week. Some of the\r\npackets containing the salt had broken, so that all did not get the\r\nfull ration. On the other hand, one man dropped his week’s ration on\r\nthe floor of the hut, amongst the stones and dirt. It was quickly\r\ncollected, and he found to his delight that he had enough now to last\r\nhim for three weeks. Of course it was not _all_ salt. The hot drink\r\nconsisted at first of milk made from milk-powder up to about\r\none-quarter of its proper strength. This was later on diluted still\r\nmore, and sometimes replaced by a drink made from a pea-soup-like\r\npacking from the Bovril sledging rations. For midwinter’s day\r\ncelebrations, a mixture of one teaspoonful of methylated spirit in a\r\npint of hot water, flavoured with a little ginger and sugar, served to\r\nremind some of cock-tails and _Veuve Cliquot_.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast each had a piece of seal or half a penguin breast.\r\nLuncheon consisted of one biscuit on three days a week, nut-food on\r\nThursdays, bits of blubber, from which most of the oil had been\r\nextracted for the lamps, on two days a week, and nothing on the\r\nremaining day. On this day breakfast consisted of a half-strength\r\nsledging ration. Supper was almost invariably seal and penguin, cut up\r\nvery finely and fried with a little seal blubber.\r\n\r\nThere were occasionally very welcome variations from this menu. Some\r\npaddies—a little white bird not unlike a pigeon—were snared with a loop\r\nof string, and fried, with one water-sodden biscuit, for lunch. Enough\r\nbarley and peas for one meal all round of each had been saved, and when\r\nthis was issued it was a day of great celebration. Sometimes, by\r\ngeneral consent, the luncheon biscuit would be saved, and, with the\r\nnext serving of biscuit, was crushed in a canvas bag into a powder and\r\nboiled, with a little sugar, making a very satisfying pudding. When\r\nblubber was fairly plentiful there was always a saucepan of cold water,\r\nmade from melting down the pieces of ice which had broken off from the\r\nglacier, fallen into the sea, and been washed ashore, for them to\r\nquench their thirst in. As the experience of Arctic explorers tended to\r\nshow that sea-water produced a form of dysentery, Wild was rather\r\ndiffident about using it. Penguin carcasses boiled in one part of\r\nsea-water to four of fresh were a great success, though, and no\r\nill-effects were felt by anybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Elephant Island]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Rescue Ship Sighted]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ringed penguins migrated north the day after we landed at Cape\r\nWild, and though every effort was made to secure as large a stock of\r\nmeat and blubber as possible, by the end of the month the supply was so\r\nlow that only one hot meal a day could be served. Twice the usual\r\nnumber of penguin steaks were cooked at breakfast, and the ones\r\nintended for supper were kept hot in the pots by wrapping up in coats,\r\netc. “Clark put our saucepanful in his sleeping-bag to-day to keep it\r\nhot, and it really was a great success in spite of the extra helping of\r\nreindeer hairs that it contained. In this way we can make ten penguin\r\nskins do for one day.”\r\n\r\nSome who were fortunate enough to catch penguins with fairly large\r\nundigested fish in their gullets used to warm these up in tins hung on\r\nbits of wire round the stove.\r\n\r\n“All the meat intended for hooshes is cut up inside the hut, as it is\r\ntoo cold outside. As the boards which we use for the purpose are also\r\nused for cutting up tobacco, when we still have it, a definite flavour\r\nis sometimes imparted to the hoosh, which, if anything, improves it.”\r\n\r\nTheir diet was now practically all meat, and not too much of that, and\r\nall the diaries bear witness to their craving for carbohydrates, such\r\nas flour, oatmeal, etc. One man longingly speaks of the cabbages which\r\ngrow on Kerguelen Island. By June 18 there were only nine hundred lumps\r\nof sugar left, _i.e._, just over forty pieces each. Even my readers\r\nknow what shortage of sugar means at this very date, but from a\r\ndifferent cause. Under these circumstances it is not surprising that\r\nall their thoughts and conversation should turn to food, past and\r\nfuture banquets, and second helpings that had been once refused.\r\n\r\nA census was taken, each man being asked to state just what he would\r\nlike to eat at that moment if he were allowed to have anything that he\r\nwanted. All, with but one exception, desired a suet pudding of some\r\nsort—the “duff” beloved of sailors. Macklin asked for many returns of\r\nscrambled eggs on hot buttered toast. Several voted for “a prodigious\r\nDevonshire dumpling,” while Wild wished for “any old dumpling so long\r\nas it was a large one.” The craving for carbohydrates, such as flour\r\nand sugar, and for fats was very real. Marston had with him a small\r\npenny cookery book. From this he would read out one recipe each night,\r\nso as to make them last. This would be discussed very seriously, and\r\nalterations and improvements suggested, and then they would turn into\r\ntheir bags to dream of wonderful meals that they could never reach. The\r\nfollowing conversation was recorded in one diary:\r\n\r\n“WILD: ‘Do you like doughnuts?’\r\n\r\n“McILROY: ‘Rather!’\r\n\r\n“WILD: ‘Very easily made, too. I like them cold with a little jam.’\r\n\r\n“McILROY: ‘Not bad; but how about a huge omelette?’\r\n\r\n“WILD: ‘Fine!’ (with a deep sigh).\r\n\r\n“Overhead, two of the sailors are discussing, some extraordinary\r\nmixture of hash, apple-sauce, beer, and cheese. Marston is in his\r\nhammock reading from his penny cookery book. Farther down, some one\r\neulogizes Scotch shortbread. Several of the sailors are talking of\r\nspotted dog, sea-pie, and Lockhart’s with great feeling. Some one\r\nmentions nut-food, whereat the conversation becomes general, and we all\r\ndecide to buy one pound’s worth of it as soon as we get to\r\ncivilization, and retire to a country house to eat it undisturbed. At\r\npresent we really mean it, too!”\r\n\r\nMidwinter’s day, the great Polar festival, was duly observed. A\r\n“magnificent breakfast” of sledging ration hoosh, full strength and\r\nwell boiled to thicken it, with hot milk was served. Luncheon consisted\r\nof a wonderful pudding, invented by Wild, made of powdered biscuit\r\nboiled with twelve pieces of mouldy nut-food. Supper was a very finely\r\ncut seal hoosh flavoured with sugar.\r\n\r\nAfter supper they had a concert, accompanied by Hussey on his\r\n“indispensable banjo.” This banjo was the last thing to be saved off\r\nthe ship before she sank, and I took it with us as a mental tonic. It\r\nwas carried all the way through with us, and landed on Elephant Island\r\npractically unharmed, and did much to keep the men cheerful. Nearly\r\nevery Saturday night such a concert was held, when each one sang a song\r\nabout some other member of the party. If that other one objected to\r\nsome of the remarks, a worse one was written for the next week.\r\n\r\nThe cook, who had carried on so well and for so long, was given a rest\r\non August 9, and each man took it in turns to be cook for one week. As\r\nthe cook and his “mate” had the privilege of scraping out the\r\nsaucepans, there was some anxiety to secure the job, especially amongst\r\nthose with the larger appetites. “The last of the methylated spirit was\r\ndrunk on August 12, and from then onwards the King’s health,\r\n‘sweethearts and wives,’ and ‘the Boss and crew of the _Caird_,’ were\r\ndrunk in hot water and ginger every Saturday night.”\r\n\r\nThe penguins and seals which had migrated north at the beginning of\r\nwinter had not yet returned, or else the ice-foot, which surrounded the\r\nspit to a thickness of six feet, prevented them from coming ashore, so\r\nthat food was getting short. Old seal-bones, that had been used once\r\nfor a meal and then thrown away, were dug up and stewed down with\r\nsea-water. Penguin carcasses were treated likewise. Limpets were\r\ngathered from the pools disclosed between the rocks below high tide,\r\nafter the pack-ice had been driven away. It was a cold job gathering\r\nthese little shell-fish, as for each one the whole hand and arm had to\r\nbe plunged into the icy water, and many score of these small creatures\r\nhad to be collected to make anything of a meal. Seaweed boiled in\r\nsea-water was used to eke out the rapidly diminishing stock of seal and\r\npenguin meat. This did not agree with some of the party. Though it was\r\nacknowledged to be very tasty it only served to increase their\r\nappetite—a serious thing when there was nothing to satisfy it with! One\r\nman remarked in his diary: “We had a sumptuous meal to-day—nearly five\r\nounces of solid food each.”\r\n\r\nIt is largely due to Wild, and to his energy, initiative, and resource,\r\nthat the whole party kept cheerful all along, and, indeed, came out\r\nalive and so well. Assisted by the two surgeons, Drs. McIlroy and\r\nMacklin, he had ever a watchful eye for the health of each one. His\r\ncheery optimism never failed, even when food was very short and the\r\nprospect of relief seemed remote. Each one in his diary speaks with\r\nadmiration of him. I think without doubt that all the party who were\r\nstranded on Elephant Island owe their lives to him. The demons of\r\ndepression could find no foothold when he was around; and, not content\r\nwith merely “telling,” he was “doing” as much as, and very often more\r\nthan, the rest. He showed wonderful capabilities of leadership and more\r\nthan justified the absolute confidence that I placed in him. Hussey,\r\nwith his cheeriness and his banjo, was another vital factor in chasing\r\naway any tendency to downheartedness.\r\n\r\nOnce they were settled in their hut, the health of the party was quite\r\ngood. Of course, they were all a bit weak, some were light-headed, all\r\nwere frost-bitten, and others, later, had attacks of heart failure.\r\nBlackborrow, whose toes were so badly frost-bitten in the boats, had to\r\nhave all five amputated while on the island. With insufficient\r\ninstruments and no proper means of sterilizing them, the operation,\r\ncarried out as it was in a dark, grimy hut, with only a blubber-stove\r\nto keep up the temperature and with an outside temperature well below\r\nfreezing, speaks volumes for the skill and initiative of the surgeons.\r\nI am glad to be able to say that the operation was very successful, and\r\nafter a little treatment ashore, very kindly given by the Chilian\r\ndoctors at Punta Arenas, he has now completely recovered and walks with\r\nonly a slight limp. Hudson, who developed bronchitis and hip disease,\r\nwas practically well again when the party was rescued. All trace of the\r\nsevere frost-bites suffered in the boat journey had disappeared, though\r\ntraces of recent superficial ones remained on some. All were naturally\r\nweak when rescued, owing to having been on such scanty rations for so\r\nlong, but all were alive and very cheerful, thanks to Frank Wild.\r\n\r\nAugust 30, 1916, is described in their diaries as a “day of wonders.”\r\nFood was very short, only two days’ seal and penguin meat being left,\r\nand no prospect of any more arriving. The whole party had been\r\ncollecting limpets and seaweed to eat with the stewed seal bones. Lunch\r\nwas being served by Wild, Hurley and Marston waiting outside to take a\r\nlast long look at the direction from which they expected the ship to\r\narrive. From a fortnight after I had left, Wild would roll up his\r\nsleeping-bag each day with the remark, “Get your things ready, boys,\r\nthe Boss may come to-day.” And sure enough, one day the mist opened and\r\nrevealed the ship for which they had been waiting and longing and\r\nhoping for over four months. “Marston was the first to notice it, and\r\nimmediately yelled out ‘Ship O!’ The inmates of the hut mistook it for\r\na call of ‘Lunch O!’ so took no notice at first. Soon, however, we\r\nheard him pattering along the snow as fast as he could run, and in a\r\ngasping, anxious voice, hoarse with excitement, he shouted, ‘Wild,\r\nthere’s a ship! Hadn’t we better light a flare?’ We all made one dive\r\nfor our narrow door. Those who could not get through tore down the\r\ncanvas walls in their hurry and excitement. The hoosh-pot with our\r\nprecious limpets and seaweed was kicked over in the rush. There, just\r\nrounding the island which had previously hidden her from our sight, we\r\nsaw a little ship flying the Chilian flag.\r\n\r\n“We tried to cheer, but excitement had gripped our vocal chords.\r\nMacklin had made a rush for the flagstaff, previously placed in the\r\nmost conspicuous position on the ice-slope. The running-gear would not\r\nwork, and the flag was frozen into a solid, compact mass so he tied his\r\njersey to the top of the pole for a signal.\r\n\r\n“Wild put a pick through our last remaining tin of petrol, and soaking\r\ncoats, mitts, and socks with it, carried them to the top of Penguin\r\nHill at the end of our spit, and soon, they were ablaze.\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile most of us had gathered on the foreshore watching with\r\nanxious eyes for any signs that the ship had seen us, or for any\r\nanswering signals. As we stood and gazed she seemed to turn away as if\r\nshe had not seen us. Again and again we cheered, though our feeble\r\ncries could certainly not have carried so far. Suddenly she stopped, a\r\nboat was lowered, and we could recognize Sir Ernest’s figure as he\r\nclimbed down the ladder. Simultaneously we burst into a cheer, and then\r\none said to the other, ‘Thank God, the Boss is safe.’ For I think that\r\nhis safety was of more concern to us than was our own.\r\n\r\n“Soon the boat approached near enough for the Boss, who was standing up\r\nin the bows, to shout to Wild, ‘Are you all well?’ To which he replied,\r\n‘All safe, all well,’ and we could see a smile light up the Boss’s face\r\nas he said, ‘Thank God!’\r\n\r\n“Before he could land he threw ashore handsful of cigarettes and\r\ntobacco; and these the smokers, who for two months had been trying to\r\nfind solace in such substitutes as seaweed, finely chopped pipe-bowls,\r\nseal meat, and sennegrass, grasped greedily.\r\n\r\n“Blackborrow, who could not walk, had been carried to a high rock and\r\npropped up in his sleeping-bag, so that he could view the wonderful\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n“Soon we were tumbling into the boat, and the Chilian sailors, laughing\r\nup at us, seemed as pleased at our rescue as we were. Twice more the\r\nboat returned, and within an hour of our first having sighted the boat\r\nwe were heading northwards to the outer world from which we had had no\r\nnews since October 1914, over twenty-two months before. We are like men\r\nawakened from a long sleep. We are trying to acquire suddenly the\r\nperspective which the rest of the world has acquired gradually through\r\ntwo years of war. There are many events which have happened of which we\r\nshall never know.\r\n\r\n“Our first meal, owing to our weakness and the atrophied state of our\r\nstomachs, proved disastrous to a good many. They soon recovered though.\r\nOur beds were just shake-downs on cushions and settees, though the\r\nofficer on watch very generously gave up his bunk to two of us. I think\r\nwe got very little sleep that night. It was just heavenly to lie and\r\nlisten to the throb of the engines, instead of to the crack of the\r\nbreaking floe, the beat of the surf on the ice-strewn shore, or the\r\nhowling of the blizzard.\r\n\r\n“We intend to keep August 30 as a festival for the rest of our lives.”\r\n\r\nYou readers can imagine my feelings as I stood in the little cabin\r\nwatching my rescued comrades feeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “All Safe! All Well!”]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View through a Cave on Elephant Island]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\nTHE ROSS SEA PARTY\r\n\r\n\r\nI now turn to the fortunes and misfortunes of the Ross Sea Party and\r\nthe _Aurora_. In spite of extraordinary difficulties occasioned by the\r\nbreaking out of the _Aurora_ from her winter quarters before sufficient\r\nstores and equipment had been landed, Captain Æneas Mackintosh and the\r\nparty under his command achieved the object of this side of the\r\nExpedition. For the depot that was the main object of the Expedition\r\nwas laid in the spot that I had indicated, and if the transcontinental\r\nparty had been fortunate enough to have crossed they would have found\r\nthe assistance, in the shape of stores, that would have been vital to\r\nthe success of their undertaking. Owing to the dearth of stores,\r\nclothing, and sledging equipment, the depot party was forced to travel\r\nmore slowly and with greater difficulty than would have otherwise been\r\nthe case. The result was that in making this journey the greatest\r\nqualities of endurance, self-sacrifice, and patience were called for,\r\nand the call was not in vain, as you reading the following pages will\r\nrealize. It is more than regrettable that after having gone through\r\nthose many months of hardship and toil, Mackintosh and Hayward should\r\nhave been lost. Spencer-Smith during those long days, dragged by his\r\ncomrades on the sledge, suffering but never complaining, became an\r\nexample to all men. Mackintosh and Hayward owed their lives on that\r\njourney to the unremitting care and strenuous endeavours of Joyce,\r\nWild, and Richards, who, also scurvy-stricken but fitter than their\r\ncomrades, dragged them through the deep snow and blizzards on the\r\nsledges. I think that no more remarkable story of human endeavour has\r\nbeen revealed than the tale of that long march which I have collated\r\nfrom various diaries. Unfortunately, the diary of the leader of this\r\nside of the Expedition was lost with him. The outstanding feature of\r\nthe Ross Sea side was the journey made by these six men. The earlier\r\njourneys for the first year did not produce any sign of the qualities\r\nof leadership amongst the others. Mackintosh was fortunate for the long\r\njourney in that he had these three men with him: Ernest Wild, Richards,\r\nand Joyce.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding with the adventures of this party I want to make\r\nclear in these pages how much I appreciate the assistance I received\r\nboth in Australia and New Zealand, especially in the latter dominion.\r\nAnd amongst the many friends there it is not invidious on my part to\r\nlay special stress on the name of Leonard Tripp, who has been my\r\nmentor, counsellor, and friend for many years, and who, when the\r\nExpedition was in precarious and difficult circumstances, devoted his\r\nenergy, thought, and gave his whole time and advice to the best\r\ninterests of our cause. I also must thank Edward Saunders, who for the\r\nsecond time has greatly helped me in preparing an Expedition record for\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nTo the Dominion Government I tender my warmest thanks. To the people of\r\nNew Zealand, and especially to those many friends—too numerous to\r\nmention here—who helped us when our fortunes were at a low ebb, I wish\r\nto say that their kindness is an ever-green memory to me. If ever a man\r\nhad cause to be grateful for assistance in dark days, I am he.\r\n\r\nThe _Aurora_, under the command of Captain Æneas Mackintosh, sailed\r\nfrom Hobart for the Ross Sea on December 24, 1914. The ship had\r\nrefitted in Sydney, where the State and Federal Governments had given\r\ngenerous assistance, and would be able, if necessary, to spend two\r\nyears in the Antarctic. My instructions to Captain Mackintosh, in\r\nbrief, were to proceed to the Ross Sea, make a base at some convenient\r\npoint in or near McMurdo Sound, land stores and equipment, and lay\r\ndepots on the Great Ice Barrier in the direction of the Beardmore\r\nGlacier for the use of the party that I expected to bring overland from\r\nthe Weddell Sea coast. This programme would involve some heavy\r\nsledging, but the ground to be covered was familiar, and I had not\r\nanticipated that the work would present any great difficulties. The\r\n_Aurora_ carried materials for a hut, equipment for landing and\r\nsledging parties, stores and clothing of all the kinds required, and an\r\nample supply of sledges. There were also dog teams and one of the\r\nmotor-tractors. I had told Captain Mackintosh that it was possible the\r\ntranscontinental journey would be attempted in the 1914–15 season in\r\nthe event of the landing on the Weddell Sea coast proving unexpectedly\r\neasy, and it would be his duty, therefore, to lay out depots to the\r\nsouth immediately after his arrival at his base. I had directed him to\r\nplace a depot of food and fuel-oil at lat. 80° S. in 1914–15, with\r\ncairns and flags as guides to a sledging party approaching from the\r\ndirection of the Pole. He would place depots farther south in the\r\n1915–16 season.\r\n\r\nThe _Aurora_ had an uneventful voyage southwards. She anchored off the\r\nsealing-huts at Macquarie Island on Christmas Day, December 25. The\r\nwireless station erected by Sir Douglas Mawson’s Australian Antarctic\r\nExpedition could be seen on a hill to the north-west with the\r\nExpedition’s hut at the base of the hill. This hut was still occupied\r\nby a meteorological staff, and later in the day the meteorologist, Mr.\r\nTulloch, came off to the ship and had dinner aboard. The _Aurora_ had\r\nsome stores for the Macquarie Island party, and these were sent ashore\r\nduring succeeding days in the boats. The landing-place was a rough,\r\nkelp-guarded beach, where lay the remains of the New Zealand barque\r\n_Clyde_. Macquarie Island anchorages are treacherous, and several ships\r\nengaged in the sealing and whaling trade have left their bones on the\r\nrocky shores, where bask great herds of seals and sea-elephants. The\r\n_Aurora_ sailed from the island on December 31, and three days later\r\nthey sighted the first iceberg, a tabular berg rising 250 ft. above the\r\nsea. This was in lat. 62° 44´ S., long. 169° 58´ E. The next day, in\r\nlat. 64° 27´ 38´´ S., the _Aurora_ passed through the first belt of\r\npack-ice. At 9 a.m. on January 7, Mount Sabine, a mighty peak of the\r\nAdmiralty Range, South Victoria Land, was sighted seventy-five miles\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nIt had been proposed that a party of three men should travel to Cape\r\nCrozier from winter quarters during the winter months in order to\r\nsecure emperor penguins’ eggs. The ship was to call at Cape Crozier,\r\nland provisions, and erect a small hut of fibro-concrete sheets for the\r\nuse of this party. The ship was off the Cape on the afternoon of\r\nJanuary 9, and a boat put off with Stenhouse, Cope, Joyce, Ninnis,\r\nMauger, and Aitken to search for a landing-place. “We steered in\r\ntowards the Barrier,” wrote Stenhouse, “and found an opening leading\r\ninto a large bight which jutted back to eastward into the Barrier. We\r\nendeavoured without success to scale the steep ice-foot under the\r\ncliffs, and then proceeded up the bay. Pulling along the edge of\r\nperpendicular ice, we turned into a bay in the ice-cliff and came to a\r\ncul-de-sac, at the head of which was a grotto. At the head of the\r\ngrotto and on a ledge of snow were perched some adelie penguins. The\r\nbeautiful green and blue tints in the ice-colouring made a picture as\r\nunreal as a stage setting. Coming back along the edge of the bight\r\ntowards the land, we caught and killed one penguin, much to the\r\nsurprise of another, which ducked into a niche in the ice and, after\r\nmuch squawking, was extracted with a boat-hook and captured. We\r\nreturned to our original landing, and were fortunate in our time, for\r\nno sooner had we cleared the ledge where Ninnis had been hanging in his\r\nendeavour to catch the penguin than the barrier calved and a piece\r\nweighing hundreds of tons toppled over into the sea.\r\n\r\n“Since we left the ship a mist had blown up from the south, and when we\r\narrived back at the entrance to the bay the ship could be but dimly\r\nseen. We found a slope on the ice-foot, and Joyce and I managed, by\r\ncutting steps, to climb up to a ledge of debris between the cliffs and\r\nthe ice, which we thought might lead to the vicinity of the emperor\r\npenguin rookery. I sent the boat back to the ship to tell the captain\r\nof our failure to find a spot where we could depot the hut and stores,\r\nand then, with Joyce, set out to walk along the narrow land between the\r\ncliffs and the ice to the southward in hopes of finding the rookery. We\r\nwalked for about a mile along the foot of the cliffs, over undulating\r\npaths, sometimes crawling carefully down a gully and then over rocks\r\nand debris which had fallen from the steep cliffs which towered above\r\nus, but we saw no signs of a rookery or any place where a rookery could\r\nbe. Close to the cliffs and separated from them by the path on which we\r\ntravelled, the Barrier in its movement towards the sea had broken and\r\nshowed signs of pressure. Seeing a turn in the cliffs ahead, which we\r\nthought might lead to better prospects, we trudged on, and were\r\nrewarded by a sight which Joyce admitted as being the grandest he had\r\never witnessed. The Barrier had come into contact with the cliffs and,\r\nfrom where we viewed it, it looked as if icebergs had fallen into a\r\ntremendous cavern and lay jumbled together in wild disorder. Looking\r\ndown into that wonderful picture one realized a little the\r\n‘eternalness’ of things.\r\n\r\n“We had not long to wait, and, much as we wished to go ahead, had to\r\nturn back. I went into a small crevasse; no damage. Arriving back at\r\nthe place where we left the boat we found it had not returned, so sat\r\ndown under an overhang and smoked and enjoyed the sense of loneliness.\r\nSoon the boat appeared out of the mist, and the crew had much news for\r\nus. After we left the ship the captain manœuvred her in order to get\r\nclose to the Barrier, but, unfortunately, the engines were loath to be\r\nreversed when required to go astern and the ship hit the Barrier end\r\non. The Barrier here is about twenty feet high, and her jib-boom took\r\nthe weight and snapped at the cap. When I returned Thompson was busy\r\ngetting the broken boom and gear aboard. Luckily the cap was not broken\r\nand no damage was done aloft, but it was rather a bad introduction to\r\nthe Antarctic. There is no place to land the Cape Crozier hut and\r\nstores, so we must build a hut in the winter here, which will mean so\r\nmuch extra sledging from winter quarters. Bad start, good finish! Joyce\r\nand I went aloft to the crow’s-nest, but could see no opening in the\r\nBarrier to eastward where a ship might enter and get farther south.”\r\n\r\nMackintosh proceeded into McMurdo Sound. Heavy pack delayed the ship\r\nfor three days, and it was not until January 16 that she reached a\r\npoint off Cape Evans, where he landed ten tons of coal and ninety-eight\r\ncases of oil. During succeeding days Captain Mackintosh worked the\r\n_Aurora_ southward, and by January 24 he was within nine miles of Hut\r\nPoint. There he made the ship fast to sea-ice, then breaking up\r\nrapidly, and proceeded to arrange sledging parties. It was his\r\nintention to direct the laying of the depots himself and to leave his\r\nfirst officer, Lieut. J. R. Stenhouse, in command of the _Aurora_, with\r\ninstructions to select a base and land a party.\r\n\r\nThe first objective was Hut Point, where stands the hut erected by the\r\n_Discovery_ expedition in 1902. An advance party, consisting of Joyce\r\n(in charge), Jack, and Gaze, with dogs and fully loaded sledges, left\r\nthe ship on January 24; Mackintosh, with Wild and Smith, followed the\r\nnext day; and a supporting party, consisting of Cope (in charge),\r\nStevens, Ninnis, Haywood, Hooke, and Richards, left the ship on January\r\n30. The first two parties had dog teams. The third party took with it\r\nthe motor-tractor, which does not appear to have given the good service\r\nthat I had hoped to get from it. These parties had a strenuous time\r\nduring the weeks that followed. The men, fresh from shipboard, were not\r\nin the best of training, and the same was true of the dogs. It was\r\nunfortunate that the dogs had to be worked so early after their arrival\r\nin the Antarctic. They were in poor condition and they had not learned\r\nto work together as teams. The result was the loss of many of the dogs,\r\nand this proved a serious matter in the following season. Captain\r\nMackintosh’s record of the sledging in the early months of 1915 is\r\nfairly full. It will not be necessary here to follow the fortunes of\r\nthe various parties in detail, for although the men were facing\r\ndifficulties and dangers, they were on well-travelled ground, which has\r\nbeen made familiar to most readers by the histories of earlier\r\nExpeditions.\r\n\r\nCaptain Mackintosh and his party left the _Aurora_ on the evening of\r\nJanuary 25. They had nine dogs and one heavily loaded sledge, and\r\nstarted off briskly to the accompaniment of a cheer from their\r\nshipmates. The dogs were so eager for exercise after their prolonged\r\nconfinement aboard the ship that they dashed forward at their best\r\nspeed, and it was necessary for one man to sit upon the sledge in order\r\nto moderate the pace. Mackintosh had hoped to get to Hut Point that\r\nnight, but luck was against him. The weather broke after he had\r\ntravelled about five miles, and snow, which completely obscured all\r\nlandmarks, sent him into camp on the sea-ice. The weather was still\r\nthick on the following morning, and the party, making a start after\r\nbreakfast, missed its way. “We shaped a course where I imagined Hut\r\nPoint to be,” wrote Captain Mackintosh in his diary, “but when the\r\nsledge-meter showed thirteen miles fifty yards, which is four miles in\r\nexcess of the distance from the slip to Hut Point, I decided to halt\r\nagain. The surface was changing considerably and the land was still\r\nobscured. We have been travelling over a thick snow surface, in which\r\nwe sink deeply, and the dogs are not too cheerful about it.” They\r\nstarted again at noon on January 27, when the weather had cleared\r\nsufficiently to reveal the land, and reached Hut Point at 4 p.m. The\r\nsledge-meter showed that the total distance travelled had been over\r\nseventeen miles. Mackintosh found in the hut a note from Joyce, who had\r\nbeen there on the 25th, and who reported that one of his dogs had been\r\nkilled in a fight with its companions. The hut contained some stores\r\nleft there by earlier Expeditions. The party stayed there for the\r\nnight. Mackintosh left a note for Stenhouse directing him to place\r\nprovisions in the hut in case the sledging parties did not return in\r\ntime to be taken off by the ship. Early next morning Joyce reached the\r\nhut. He had encountered bad ice and had come back to consult with\r\nMackintosh regarding the route to be followed. Mackintosh directed him\r\nto steer out towards Black Island in crossing the head of the Sound\r\nbeyond Hut Point.\r\n\r\nMackintosh left Hut Point on January 28. He had taken some additional\r\nstores, and he mentions that the sledge now weighed 1200 lbs. This was\r\na heavy load, but the dogs were pulling well and he thought it\r\npracticable. He encountered difficulty almost at once after descending\r\nthe slope from the point to the sea-ice, for the sledge stuck in soft\r\nsnow and the party had to lighten the load and relay until they reached\r\na better surface. They were having trouble with the dogs, which did not\r\npull cheerfully, and the total distance covered in the day was under\r\nfour miles. The weather was warm and the snow consequently was soft.\r\nMackintosh had decided that it would be best to travel at night. A fall\r\nof snow held up the party throughout the following day, and they did\r\nnot get away from their camp until shortly before midnight. “The\r\nsurface was abominably soft,” wrote Mackintosh. “We harnessed ourselves\r\non to the sledge and with the dogs made a start, but we had a struggle\r\nto get off. We had not gone very far when in deeper snow we stopped\r\ndead. Try as we would, no movement could be produced. Reluctantly we\r\nunloaded and began the tedious task of relaying. The work, in spite of\r\nthe lighter load on the sledge, proved terrific for ourselves and for\r\nthe dogs. We struggled for four hours, and then set camp to await the\r\nevening, when the sun would not be so fierce and the surface might be\r\nbetter. I must say I feel somewhat despondent, as we are not getting on\r\nas well as I expected, nor do we find it as easy as one would gather\r\nfrom reading.”\r\n\r\nThe two parties met again that day. Joyce also had been compelled to\r\nrelay his load, and all hands laboured strenuously and advanced slowly.\r\nThey reached the edge of the Barrier on the night of January 30 and\r\nclimbed an easy slope to the Barrier surface, about thirty feet above\r\nthe sea-ice. The dogs were showing signs of fatigue, and when\r\nMackintosh camped at 6.30 a.m. on January 31, he reckoned that the\r\ndistance covered in twelve and a half hours had been about two and a\r\nhalf miles. The men had killed a seal at the edge of the sea-ice and\r\nplaced the meat on a cairn for future use. One dog, having refused to\r\npull, had been left behind with a good feed of meat, and Mackintosh\r\nhoped the animal would follow. The experiences of the party during the\r\ndays that followed can be indicated by some extracts from Mackintosh’s\r\ndiary.\r\n\r\n“_Sunday, January_ 31.—Started off this afternoon at 3 p.m. Surface too\r\ndreadful for words. We sink into snow at times up to our knees, the\r\ndogs struggling out of it panting and making great efforts. I think the\r\nsoft snow must be accounted for by a phenomenally fine summer without\r\nmuch wind. After proceeding about 1000 yds. I spotted some poles on our\r\nstarboard side. We shaped course for these and found Captain Scott’s\r\nSafety Camp. We unloaded a relay here and went back with empty sledge\r\nfor the second relay. It took us four hours to do just this short\r\ndistance. It is exasperating. After we had got the second load up we\r\nhad lunch. Then we dug round the poles, while snow fell, and after\r\ngetting down about three feet we came across, first, a bag of oats,\r\nlower down two cases of dog-biscuit—one with a complete week’s ration,\r\nthe other with seal meat. A good find. About forty paces away we found\r\na venesta-lid sticking out of the snow. Smith scraped round this with\r\nhis ice-axe and presently discovered one of the motor-sledges Captain\r\nScott used. Everything was just as it had been left, the petrol-tank\r\npartly filled and apparently undeteriorated. We marked the spot with a\r\npole. The snow clearing, we proceeded with a relay. We got only half a\r\nmile, still struggling in deep snow, and then went back for the second\r\nload. We can still see the cairn erected at the Barrier edge and a\r\nblack spot which we take to be the dog.\r\n\r\n“_February_ 1.—We turned out at 7.30 p.m., and after a meal broke camp.\r\nWe made a relay of two and a half miles. The sledge-meter stopped\r\nduring this relay. Perhaps that is the cause of our mileage not\r\nshowing. We covered seven and a half miles in order to bring the load\r\ntwo and a half miles. After lunch we decided, as the surface was\r\ngetting better, to make a shot at travelling with the whole load. It\r\nwas a back-breaking job. Wild led the team, while Smith and I pulled in\r\nharness. The great trouble is to get the sledge started after the many\r\nunavoidable stops. We managed to cover one mile. This even is better\r\nthan relaying. We then camped—the dogs being entirely done up, poor\r\nbrutes.\r\n\r\n“_February_ 2.—We were awakened this afternoon, while in our bags, by\r\nhearing Joyce’s dogs barking. They have done well and have caught us\r\nup. Joyce’s voice was heard presently, asking us the time. He is\r\nmanaging the full load. We issued a challenge to race him to the Bluff,\r\nwhich he accepted. When we turned out at 6.30 p.m. his camp was seen\r\nabout three miles ahead. About 8 p.m., after our hoosh, we made a\r\nstart, and reached Joyce’s camp at 1 a.m. The dogs had been pulling\r\nwell, seeing the camp ahead, but when we arrived off it they were not\r\ninclined to go on. After a little persuasion and struggle we got off,\r\nbut not for long. This starting business is terrible work. We have to\r\nshake the sledge and its big load while we shout to the dogs to start.\r\nIf they do not pull together it is useless. When we get the sledge\r\ngoing we are on tenter-hooks lest it stop again on the next soft slope,\r\nand this often occurs. Sledging is real hard work; but we are getting\r\nalong.”\r\n\r\nThe surface was better on February 2, and the party covered six miles\r\nwithout relaying. They camped in soft snow, and when they started the\r\nnext day they were two hours relaying over one hundred and fifty yards.\r\nThen they got into Joyce’s track and found the going better. Mackintosh\r\novertook Joyce on the morning of February 4 and went ahead, his party\r\nbreaking trail during the next march. They covered ten miles on the\r\nnight of the 4th. One dog had “chucked his hand in” on the march, and\r\nMackintosh mentions that he intended to increase the dogs’ allowance of\r\nfood. The surface was harder, and during the night of February 5\r\nMackintosh covered eleven miles twenty-five yards, but he finished with\r\ntwo dogs on the sledge. Joyce was travelling by day, so that the\r\nparties passed one another daily on the march.\r\n\r\nA blizzard came from the south on February 10 and the parties were\r\nconfined to their tents for over twenty-four hours. The weather\r\nmoderated on the morning of the next day, and at 11 a.m. Mackintosh\r\ncamped beside Joyce and proceeded to rearrange the parties. One of his\r\ndogs had died on the 9th, and several others had ceased to be worth\r\nmuch for pulling. He had decided to take the best dogs from the two\r\nteams and continue the march with Joyce and Wild, while Smith, Jack,\r\nand Gaze went back to Hut Point with the remaining dogs. This involved\r\nthe adjustment of sledge-loads in order that the proper supplies might\r\nbe available for the depots. He had eight dogs and Smith had five. A\r\ndepot of oil and fuel was laid at this point and marked by a cairn with\r\na bamboo pole rising ten feet above it. The change made for better\r\nprogress. Smith turned back at once, and the other party went ahead\r\nfairly rapidly, the dogs being able to haul the sledge without much\r\nassistance from the men. The party built a cairn of snow after each\r\nhour’s travelling to serve as guides to the depot and as marks for the\r\nreturn journey. Another blizzard held the men up on February 13, and\r\nthey had an uncomfortable time in their sleeping-bags owing to low\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nDuring succeeding days the party plodded forward. They were able to\r\ncover from five to twelve miles a day, according to the surface and\r\nweather. They built the cairns regularly and checked their route by\r\ntaking bearings of the mountains to the west. They were able to cover\r\nfrom five to twelve miles a day, the dogs pulling fairly well. They\r\nreached lat. 80° S. on the afternoon of February 20. Mackintosh had\r\nhoped to find a depot laid in that neighbourhood by Captain Scott, but\r\nno trace of it was seen. The surface had been very rough during the\r\nafternoon, and for that reason the depot to be laid there was named\r\nRocky Mountain Depot. The stores were to be placed on a substantial\r\ncairn, and smaller cairns were to be built at right angles to the depot\r\nas a guide to the overland party. “As soon as breakfast was over,”\r\nwrote Mackintosh the next day, “Joyce and Wild went off with a light\r\nsledge and the dogs to lay out the cairns and place flags to the\r\neastward, building them at every mile. The outer cairn had a large flag\r\nand a note indicating the position of the depot. I remained behind to\r\nget angles and fix our position with the theodolite. The temperature\r\nwas very low this morning, and handling the theodolite was not too warm\r\na job for the fingers. My whiskers froze to the metal while I was\r\ntaking a sight. After five hours the others arrived back. They had\r\ncovered ten miles, five miles out and five miles back. During the\r\nafternoon we finished the cairn, which we have built to a height of\r\neight feet. It is a solid square erection which ought to stand a good\r\ndeal of weathering, and on top we have placed a bamboo pole with a\r\nflag, making the total height twenty-five feet. Building the cairn was\r\na fine warming job, but the ice on our whiskers often took some ten\r\nminutes thawing out. To-morrow we hope to lay out the cairns to the\r\nwestward, and then to shape our course for the Bluff.”\r\n\r\nThe weather, became bad again during the night. A blizzard kept the men\r\nin their sleeping-bags on February 21, and it was not until the\r\nafternoon of the 23rd that Mackintosh and Joyce made an attempt to lay\r\nout the cairns to the west. They found that two of the dogs had died\r\nduring the storm, leaving seven dogs to haul the sledge. They marched a\r\nmile and a half to the westward and built a cairn, but the weather was\r\nvery thick and they did not think it wise to proceed farther. They\r\ncould not see more than a hundred yards and the tent was soon out of\r\nsight. They returned to the camp, and stayed there until the morning of\r\nFebruary 24, when they started the return march with snow still\r\nfalling. “We did get off from our camp,” says Mackintosh, “but had only\r\nproceeded about four hundred yards when the fog came on so thick that\r\nwe could scarcely see a yard ahead, so we had to pitch the tent again,\r\nand are now sitting inside hoping the weather will clear. We are going\r\nback with only ten days’ provisions, so it means pushing on for all we\r\nare worth. These stoppages are truly annoying. The poor dogs are\r\nfeeling hungry; they eat their harness or any straps that may be about.\r\nWe can give them nothing beyond their allowance of three biscuits each\r\nas we are on bare rations ourselves; but I feel sure they require more\r\nthan one pound a day. That is what they are getting now.... After lunch\r\nwe found it a little clearer, but a very bad light. We decided to push\r\non. It is weird travelling in this light. There is no contrast or\r\noutline; the sky and the surface are one, and we cannot discern\r\nundulations, which we encounter with disastrous results. We picked up\r\nthe first of our outward cairns. This was most fortunate. After passing\r\na second cairn everything became blotted out, and so we were forced to\r\ncamp, after covering 4 miles 703 yds. The dogs are feeling the pangs of\r\nhunger and devouring everything they see. They will eat anything except\r\nrope. If we had not wasted those three days we might have been able to\r\ngive them a good feed at the Bluff depot, but now that is impossible.\r\nIt is snowing hard.”\r\n\r\nThe experiences of the next few days were unhappy. Another blizzard\r\nbrought heavy snow and held the party up throughout the 25th and 26th.\r\n“Outside is a scene of chaos. The snow, whirling along with the wind,\r\nobliterates everything. The dogs are completely buried, and only a\r\nmound with a ski sticking up indicates where the sledge is. We long to\r\nbe off, but the howl of the wind shows how impossible it is. The\r\nsleeping-bags are damp and sticky, so are our clothes. Fortunately, the\r\ntemperature is fairly high and they do not freeze. One of the dogs gave\r\na bark and Joyce went out to investigate. He found that Major, feeling\r\nhungry, had dragged his way to Joyce’s ski and eaten off the leather\r\nbinding. Another dog has eaten all his harness, canvas, rope, leather,\r\nbrass, and rivets. I am afraid the dogs will not pull through; they all\r\nlook thin and these blizzards do not improve matters.... We have a\r\nweek’s provisions and one hundred and sixty miles to travel. It appears\r\nthat we will have to get another week’s provisions from the depot, but\r\ndon’t wish it. Will see what luck to-morrow. Of course, at Bluff we can\r\nreplenish.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Aurora]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ice Stalactites at the Entrance to a Cave on Elephant\r\nIsland]\r\n\r\n\r\n“We are now reduced to one meal in the twenty-four hours,” wrote\r\nMackintosh a day later. “This going without food keeps us colder. It is\r\na rotten, miserable time. It is bad enough having this wait, but we\r\nhave also the wretched thought of having to use the provisions already\r\ndepot-ed, for which we have had all this hard struggle.” The weather\r\ncleared on the 27th, and in the afternoon Mackintosh and Joyce went\r\nback to the depot, while Wild remained behind to build a cairn and\r\nattempt to dry the sleeping-bags in the sun. The stores left at the\r\ndepot had been two and a quarter tins of biscuit (42 lbs. to the tin),\r\nrations for three men for three weeks in bags, each intended to last\r\none week, and three tins of oil. Mackintosh took one of the weekly bags\r\nfrom the depot and returned to the camp. The party resumed the homeward\r\njourney the next morning, and with a sail on the sledge to take\r\nadvantage of the southerly breeze, covered nine miles and a half during\r\nthe day. But the dogs had reached almost the limit of their endurance;\r\nthree of them fell out, unable to work longer, while on the march. That\r\nevening, for the first time since leaving the _Aurora_, the men saw the\r\nsun dip to the horizon in the south, a reminder that the Antarctic\r\nsummer was nearing its close.\r\n\r\nThe remaining four dogs collapsed on March 2. “After lunch we went off\r\nfairly well for half an hour. Then Nigger commenced to wobble about,\r\nhis legs eventually giving under him. We took him out of his harness\r\nand let him travel along with us, but he has given us all he can, and\r\nnow can only lie down. After Nigger, my friend Pompey collapsed. The\r\ndrift, I think, accounts a good deal for this. Pompey has been splendid\r\nof late, pulling steadily and well. Then Scotty, the last dog but one,\r\ngave up. They are all lying down in our tracks. They have a painless\r\ndeath, for they curl up in the snow and fall into a sleep from which\r\nthey will never wake. We are left with one dog, Pinkey. He has not been\r\none of the pullers, but he is not despised. We can afford to give him\r\nplenty of biscuit. We must nurse him and see if we cannot return with\r\none dog at least. We are now pulling ourselves, with the sail (the\r\nfloor-cloth of the tent) set and Pinkey giving a hand. At one stage a\r\nterrific gust came along and capsized the sledge. The sail was blown\r\noff the sledge, out of its guys, and we prepared to camp, but the wind\r\nfell again to a moderate breeze, so we repaired the sledge and\r\nproceeded.\r\n\r\n“It is blowing hard this evening, cold too. Another wonderful sunset.\r\nGolden colours illuminate the sky. The moon casts beautiful rays in\r\ncombination with the more vivid ones from the dipping sun. If all was\r\nas beautiful as the scene we could consider ourselves in some paradise,\r\nbut it is dark and cold in the tent and I shiver in a frozen\r\nsleeping-bag. The inside fur is a mass of ice, congealed from my\r\nbreath. One creeps into the bag, toggles up with half-frozen fingers,\r\nand hears the crackling of the ice. Presently drops of thawing ice are\r\nfalling on one’s head. Then comes a fit of shivers. You rub yourself\r\nand turn over to warm the side of the bag which has been uppermost. A\r\npuddle of water forms under the body. After about two hours you may\r\ndoze off, but I always wake with the feeling that I have not slept a\r\nwink.”\r\n\r\nThe party made only three and a half miles on March 3. They were\r\nfinding the sledge exceedingly heavy to pull, and Mackintosh decided to\r\nremove the outer runners and scrape the bottom. These runners should\r\nhave been taken off before the party started, and the lower runners\r\npolished smooth. He also left behind all spare gear, including\r\ndog-harness in order to reduce weight, and found the lighter sledge\r\neasier to pull. The temperature that night was –28° Fahr., the lowest\r\nrecorded during the journey up to that time. “We are struggling along\r\nat a mile an hour,” wrote Mackintosh on the 5th. “It is a very hard\r\npull, the surface being very sticky. Pinkey still accompanies us. We\r\nhope we can get him in. He is getting all he wants to eat. So he\r\nought.” The conditions of travel changed the next day. A southerly wind\r\nmade possible the use of the sail, and the trouble was to prevent the\r\nsledge bounding ahead over rough sastrugi and capsizing. The handling\r\nof ropes and the sail caused many frost-bites, and occasionally the men\r\nwere dragged along the surface by the sledge. The remaining dog\r\ncollapsed during the afternoon and had to be left behind. Mackintosh\r\ndid not feel that he could afford to reduce the pace. The sledge-meter,\r\nhad got out of order, so the distance covered in the day was not\r\nrecorded. The wind increased during the night, and by the morning of\r\nthe 7th was blowing with blizzard force. The party did not move again\r\nuntil the morning of the 8th. They were still finding the sledge very\r\nheavy and were disappointed at their slow progress, their marches being\r\nsix to eight miles a day. On the 10th they got the Bluff Peak in line\r\nwith Mount Discovery. My instructions had been that the Bluff depot\r\nshould be laid on this line, and as the depot had been placed north of\r\nthe line on the outward journey, owing to thick weather making it\r\nimpossible to pick up the landmarks, Mackintosh intended now to move\r\nthe stores to the proper place. He sighted the depot flag about four\r\nmiles away, and after pitching camp at the new depot site, he went\r\nacross with Joyce and Wild and found the stores as he had left them.\r\n\r\n“We loaded the sledge with the stores, placed the large mark flag on\r\nthe sledge, and proceeded back to our tent, which was now out of sight.\r\nIndeed it was not wise to come out as we did without tent or bag. We\r\nhad taken the chance, as the weather had promised fine. As we proceeded\r\nit grew darker and darker, and eventually we were travelling by only\r\nthe light of stars, the sun having dipped. After four and a half hours\r\nwe sighted the little green tent. It was hard pulling the last two\r\nhours and weird travelling in the dark. We have put in a good day,\r\nhaving had fourteen hours’ solid marching. We are now sitting in here\r\nenjoying a very excellent thick hoosh. A light has been improvised out\r\nof an old tin with methylated spirit.”\r\n\r\nThe party spent the next day in their sleeping-bags, while a blizzard\r\nraged outside. The weather was fine again on March 12, and they built a\r\ncairn for the depot. The stores placed on this cairn comprised a six\r\nweeks’ supply of biscuit and three weeks’ full ration for three men,\r\nand three tins of oil. Early in the afternoon the men resumed their\r\nmarch northwards and made three miles before camping. “Our bags are\r\ngetting into a bad state,” wrote Mackintosh, “as it is some time now\r\nsince we have had an opportunity of drying them. We use our bodies for\r\ndrying socks and such-like clothing, which we place inside our jerseys\r\nand produce when required. Wild carries a regular wardrobe in this\r\nposition, and it is amusing to see him searching round the back of his\r\nclothes for a pair of socks. Getting away in the mornings is our\r\nbitterest time. The putting on of the finneskoe is a nightmare, for\r\nthey are always frozen stiff, and we have a great struggle to force our\r\nfeet into them. The icy sennegrass round one’s fingers is another\r\npunishment that causes much pain. We are miserable until we are\r\nactually on the move, then warmth returns with the work. Our\r\nconversation now is principally conjecture as to what can have happened\r\nto the other parties. We have various ideas.”\r\n\r\nSaturday, March 13, was another day spent in the sleeping-bags. A\r\nblizzard was raging and everything was obscured. The men saved food by\r\ntaking only one meal during the day, and they felt the effect of the\r\nshort rations in lowered vitality. Both Joyce and Wild had toes\r\nfrost-bitten while in their bags and found difficulty in getting the\r\ncirculation restored. Wild suffered particularly in this way and his\r\nfeet were very sore. The weather cleared a little the next morning, but\r\nthe drift began again before the party could break camp, and another\r\nday had to be spent in the frozen bags.\r\n\r\nThe march was resumed on March 15. “About 11 p.m. last night the\r\ntemperature commenced to get lower and the gale also diminished. The\r\nlower temperature caused the bags, which were moist, to freeze hard. We\r\nhad no sleep and spent the night twisting and turning. The morning\r\nbrought sunshine and pleasure, for the hot hoosh warmed our bodies and\r\ngave a glow that was most comforting. The sun was out, the weather fine\r\nand clear but cold. At 8.30 a.m. we made a start. We take a long time\r\nputting on our finneskoe, although we get up earlier to allow for this.\r\nThis morning we were over four hours’ getting away. We had a fine\r\nsurface this morning for marching, but we did not make much headway. We\r\ndid the usual four miles before lunch. The temperature was –23° Fahr. A\r\nmirage made the sastrugi appear to be dancing like some ice-goblins.\r\nJoyce calls them ‘dancing jimmies.’ After lunch we travelled well, but\r\nthe distance for the day was only 7 miles 400 yds. We are blaming our\r\nsledge-meter for the slow rate of progress. It is extraordinary that on\r\nthe days when we consider we are making good speed we do no more than\r\non days when we have a tussle.”\r\n\r\n“_March_ 15.—The air temperature this morning was –35° Fahr. Last night\r\nwas one of the worst I have ever experienced. To cap everything, I\r\ndeveloped toothache, presumably as a result of frost-bitten cheek. I\r\nwas in positive agony. I groaned and moaned, got the medicine-chest,\r\nbut could find nothing there to stop the pain. Joyce, who had wakened\r\nup, suggested methylated spirit, so I damped some cotton-wool, then\r\nplaced it in the tooth, with the result that I burnt the inside of my\r\nmouth. All this time my fingers, being exposed (it must have been at\r\nleast 50° below zero), were continually having to be brought back.\r\nAfter putting on the methylated spirit I went back to the bag, which,\r\nof course, was frozen stiff. I wriggled and moaned till morning brought\r\nrelief by enabling me to turn out. Joyce and Wild both had a bad night,\r\ntheir feet giving them trouble. My feet do not affect me so much as\r\ntheirs. The skin has peeled off the inside of my mouth, exposing a raw\r\nsore, as the result of the methylated spirit. My tooth is better\r\nthough. We have had to reduce our daily ration. Frost-bites are\r\nfrequent in consequence. The surface became very rough in the\r\nafternoon, and the light, too, was bad owing to cumulus clouds being\r\nmassed over the sun. We are continually falling, for we are unable to\r\ndistinguish the high and low parts of the sastrugi surface. We are\r\ntravelling on our ski. We camped at 6 p.m. after travelling 6 miles 100\r\nyds. I am writing this sitting up in the bag. This is the first\r\noccasion I have been able to do thus for some time, for usually the\r\ncold has penetrated through everything should one have the bag open.\r\nThe temperature is a little higher to-night, but still it is –21° Fahr.\r\n(53° of frost). Our matches, among other things, are running short, and\r\nwe have given up using any except for lighting the Primus.”\r\n\r\nThe party found the light bad again the next day. After stumbling on\r\nski among the sastrugi for two hours, the men discarded the ski and\r\nmade better progress; but they still had many falls, owing to the\r\nimpossibility of distinguishing slopes and irregularities in the grey,\r\nshadowless surface of the snow. They made over nine and a half miles\r\nthat day, and managed to cover ten miles on the following day, March\r\n18, one of the best marches of the journey. “I look forward to seeing\r\nthe ship. All of us bear marks of our tramp. Wild takes first place.\r\nHis nose is a picture for _Punch_ to be jealous of; his ears, too, are\r\nsore, and one big toe is a black sore. Joyce has a good nose and many\r\nminor sores. My jaw is swollen from the frost-bite I got on the cheek,\r\nand I also have a bit of nose.... We have discarded the ski, which we\r\nhitherto used, and travel in the finneskoe. This makes the sledge go\r\nbetter but it is not so comfortable travelling as on ski. We\r\nencountered a very high, rough sastrugi surface, most remarkably high,\r\nand had a cold breeze in our faces during the march. Our beards and\r\nmoustaches are masses of ice. I will take care I am clean-shaven next\r\ntime I come out. The frozen moustache makes the lobes of the nose\r\nfreeze more easily than they would if there was no ice alongside\r\nthem.... I ask myself why on earth one comes to these parts of the\r\nearth. Here we are, frostbitten in the day, frozen at night. What a\r\nlife!” The temperature at 1 p.m. that day was –23° Fahr., _i.e._ 55° of\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\nThe men camped abreast of “Corner Camp,” where they had been on\r\nFebruary 1, on the evening of March 19. The next day, after being\r\ndelayed for some hours by bad weather, they turned towards Castle Rock\r\nand proceeded across the disturbed area where the Barrier impinges upon\r\nthe land. Joyce put his foot through the snow-covering of a fairly\r\nlarge crevasse, and the course had to be changed to avoid this danger.\r\nThe march for the day was only 2 miles 900 yds. Mackintosh felt that\r\nthe pace was too slow, but was unable to quicken it owing to the bad\r\nsurfaces. The food had been cut down to close upon half-rations, and at\r\nthis reduced rate the supply still in hand would be finished in two\r\ndays. The party covered 7 miles 570 yds. on the 21st, and the hoosh\r\nthat night was “no thicker than tea.”\r\n\r\n“The first thought this morning was that we must do a good march,”\r\nwrote Mackintosh on March 22. “Once we can get to Safety Camp (at the\r\njunction of the Barrier with the sea-ice) we are right. Of course, we\r\ncan as a last resort abandon the sledge and take a run into Hut Point,\r\nabout twenty-two miles away.... We have managed quite a respectable\r\nforenoon march. The surface was hard, so we took full advantage of it.\r\nWith our low food the cold is penetrating. We had lunch at 1 p.m., and\r\nthen had left over one meal at full rations and a small quantity of\r\nbiscuits. The temperature at lunch-time was –6° Fahr. Erebus is\r\nemitting large volumes of smoke, travelling in a south-easterly\r\ndirection, and a red glare is also discernible. After lunch we again\r\naccomplished a good march, the wind favouring us for two hours. We are\r\nanxiously looking out for Safety Camp.” The distance for the day was 8\r\nmiles 1525 yds.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 23, 1915.—No sooner had we camped last night than a blizzard\r\nwith drift came on and has continued ever since. This morning finds us\r\nprisoners. The drift is lashing into the sides of the tent and\r\neverything outside is obscured. This weather is rather alarming, for if\r\nit continues we are in a bad way. We have just made a meal of cocoa\r\nmixed with biscuit-crumbs. This has warmed us up a little, but on empty\r\nstomachs the cold is penetrating.”\r\n\r\nThe weather cleared in the afternoon, but too late for the men to move\r\nthat day. They made a start at 7 a.m. on the 24th after a meal of cocoa\r\nand biscuit-crumbs.\r\n\r\n“We have some biscuit-crumbs in the bag and that is all. Our start was\r\nmade under most bitter circumstances, all of us being attacked by\r\nfrost-bites. It was an effort to bare hands for an instant. After much\r\nrubbing and ‘bringing back’ of extremities we started. Wild is a mass\r\nof bites, and we are all in a bad way. We plugged on, but warmth would\r\nnot come into our bodies. We had been pulling about two hours when\r\nJoyce’s smart eyes picked up a flag. We shoved on for all we were\r\nworth, and as we got closer, sure enough, the cases of provisions\r\nloomed up. Then what feeds we promised to give ourselves. It was not\r\nlong before we were putting our gastronomic capabilities to the test.\r\nPemmican was brought down from the depot, with oatmeal to thicken it,\r\nas well as sugar. While Wild was getting the Primus lighted he called\r\nout to us that he believed his ear had gone. This was the last piece of\r\nhis face left whole—nose, cheeks, and neck all having bites. I went\r\ninto the tent and had a look. The ear was a pale green. I quickly put\r\nthe palm of my hand to it and brought it round. Then his fingers went,\r\nand to stop this and bring back the circulation he put them over the\r\nlighted Primus, a terrible thing to do. As a result he was in agony.\r\nHis ear was brought round all right, and soon the hot hoosh sent warmth\r\ntingling through us. We felt like new beings. We simply ate till we\r\nwere full, mug after mug. After we had been well satisfied, we replaced\r\nthe cases we had pulled down from the depot and proceeded towards the\r\nGap. Just before leaving Joyce discovered a note left by Spencer-Smith\r\nand Richards. This told us that both the other parties had returned to\r\nthe Hut and apparently all was well. So that is good. When we got to\r\nthe Barrier-edge we found the ice-cliff on to the newly formed sea-ice\r\nnot safe enough to bear us, so we had to make a detour along the\r\nBarrier-edge and, if the sea ice was not negotiable, find a way up by\r\nCastle Rock. At 7 p.m., not having found any suitable place to descend\r\nto the sea-ice we camped. To-night we have the Primus going and warming\r\nour frozen selves. I hope to make Hut Point to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nMackintosh and his companions broke camp on the morning of March 25,\r\nwith the thermometer recording 55° of frost, and, after another futile\r\nsearch for a way down the ice-cliff to the sea-ice, they proceeded\r\ntowards Castle Rock. While in this course they picked up sledge-tracks,\r\nand, following these, they found a route down to the sea-ice.\r\nMackintosh decided to depot the sledge on top of a well-marked\r\nundulation and proceed without gear. A short time later the three men,\r\nafter a scramble over the cliffs of Hut Point, reached the door of the\r\nhut.\r\n\r\n“We shouted. No sound. Shouted again, and presently a dark object\r\nappeared. This turned out to be Cope, who was by himself. The other\r\nmembers of the party had gone out to fetch the gear off their sledge,\r\nwhich they also had left. Cope had been laid up, so did not go with\r\nthem. We soon were telling each other’s adventures, and we heard then\r\nhow the ship had called here on March 11 and picked up Spencer-Smith,\r\nRichards, Ninnis, Hooke, and Gaze, the present members here being Cope,\r\nHayward, and Jack. A meal was soon prepared. We found here even a\r\nblubber-fire, luxurious, but what a state of dirt and grease! However,\r\nwarmth and food are at present our principal objects. While we were\r\nhaving our meal Jack and Hayward appeared.... Late in the evening we\r\nturned into dry bags. As there are only three bags here, we take it in\r\nturns to use them. Our party have the privilege.... I got a letter here\r\nfrom Stenhouse giving a summary of his doings since we left him. The\r\nship’s party also have not had a rosy time.”\r\n\r\nMackintosh learned here that Spencer-Smith, Jack, and Gaze, who had\r\nturned back on February 10, had reached Hut Point without difficulty.\r\nThe third party, headed by Cope, had also been out on the Barrier but\r\nhad not done much. This party had attempted to use the motor-tractor,\r\nbut had failed to get effective service from the machine and had not\r\nproceeded far afield. The motor was now lying at Hut Point.\r\nSpencer-Smith’s party and Cope’s party had both returned to Hut Point\r\nbefore the end of February.\r\n\r\nThe six men now at Hut Point were cut off from the winter quarters of\r\nthe Expedition at Cape Evans by the open water of McMurdo Sound.\r\nMackintosh naturally was anxious to make the crossing and get in touch\r\nwith the ship and the other members of the shore party; but he could\r\nnot make a move until the sea-ice became firm, and, as events occurred,\r\nhe did not reach Cape Evans until the beginning of June. He went out\r\nwith Cope and Hayward on March 29 to get his sledge and brought it as\r\nfar as Pram Point, on the south side of Hut Point. He had to leave the\r\nsledge there owing to the condition of the sea-ice. He and his\r\ncompanions lived an uneventful life under primitive conditions at the\r\nhut. The weather was bad, and though the temperatures recorded were\r\nlow, the young sea-ice continually broke away. The blubber-stove in use\r\nat the hut seemed to have produced soot and grease in the usual large\r\nquantities, and the men and their clothing suffered accordingly. The\r\nwhites of their eyes contrasted vividly with the dense blackness of\r\ntheir skins. Wild and Joyce had a great deal of trouble with their\r\nfrost-bites. Joyce had both feet blistered, his knees were swollen, and\r\nhis hands also were blistered. Jack devised some blubber-lamps, which\r\nproduced an uncertain light and much additional smoke. Mackintosh\r\nrecords that the members of the party were contented enough but\r\n“unspeakably dirty,” and he writes longingly of baths and clean\r\nclothing. The store of seal-blubber ran low early in April, and all\r\nhands kept a sharp look-out for seals. On April 15 several seals were\r\nseen and killed. The operations of killing and skinning made worse the\r\ngreasy and blackened clothes of the men. It is to be regretted that\r\nthough there was a good deal of literature available, especially on\r\nthis particular district, the leaders of the various parties had not\r\ntaken advantage of it and so supplemented their knowledge. Joyce and\r\nMackintosh of course had had previous Antarctic experience: but it was\r\nopen to all to have carefully studied the detailed instructions\r\npublished in the books of the three last Expeditions in this quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\nWINTERING IN McMURDO SOUND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Aurora_, after picking up six men at Hut Point on March 11, had\r\ngone back to Cape Evans. The position chosen for the winter quarters of\r\nthe _Aurora_ was at Cape Evans, immediately off the hut erected by\r\nCaptain Scott on his last Expedition. The ship on March 14 lay about\r\nforty yards off shore, bows seaward. Two anchors had been taken ashore\r\nand embedded in heavy stone rubble, and to these anchors were attached\r\nsix steel hawsers. The hawsers held the stern, while the bow was\r\nsecured by the ordinary ship’s anchors. Later, when the new ice had\r\nformed round the _Aurora_, the cable was dragged ashore over the smooth\r\nsurface and made fast. The final moorings thus were six hawsers and one\r\ncable astern, made fast to the shore anchors, and two anchors with\r\nabout seventy fathoms of cable out forward. On March 23 Mr. Stenhouse\r\nlanded a party consisting of Stevens, Spencer-Smith, Gaze, and Richards\r\nin order that they might carry out routine observations ashore. These\r\nfour men took up their quarters in Captain Scott’s hut. They had been\r\ninstructed to kill seals for meat and blubber. The landing of stores,\r\ngear, and coal did not proceed at all rapidly, it being assumed that\r\nthe ship would remain at her moorings throughout the winter. Some tons\r\nof coal were taken ashore during April, but most of it stayed on the\r\nbeach, and much of it was lost later when the sea-ice went out. This\r\nshore party was in the charge of Stevens, and his report, handed to me\r\nmuch later, gives a succinct account of what occurred, from the point\r\nof view of the men at the hut:\r\n\r\n“CAPE EVANS, ROSS ISLAND, _July_ 30, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n“On the 23rd March, 1915, a party consisting of Spencer-Smith,\r\nRichards, and Gaze was landed at Cape Evans Hut in my charge.\r\nSpencer-Smith received independent instructions to devote his time\r\nexclusively to photography. I was verbally instructed that the main\r\nduty of the party was to obtain a supply of seals for food and fuel.\r\nScientific work was also to be carried on.\r\n\r\n“Meteorological instruments were at once installed, and experiments\r\nwere instituted on copper electrical thermometers in order to\r\nsupplement our meagre supply of instruments and enable observations of\r\nearth, ice, and sea temperatures to be made. Other experimental work\r\nwas carried on, and the whole of the time of the scientific members of\r\nthe party was occupied. All seals seen were secured. On one or two\r\noccasions the members of the shore party were summoned to work on board\r\nship.\r\n\r\n“In general the weather was unsettled, blizzards occurring frequently\r\nand interrupting communication with the ship across the ice. Only\r\nsmall, indispensable supplies of stores and no clothes were issued to\r\nthe party on shore. Only part of the scientific equipment was able to\r\nbe transferred to the shore, and the necessity to obtain that prevented\r\nsome members of the party landing all their personal gear.\r\n\r\n“The ship was moored stern on to the shore, at first well over one\r\nhundred yards from it. There were two anchors out ahead and the vessel\r\nwas made fast to two others sunk in the ground ashore by seven wires.\r\nThe strain on the wires was kept constant by tightening up from time to\r\ntime such as became slack, and easing cables forward, and in this way\r\nthe ship was brought much closer inshore. A cable was now run out to\r\nthe south anchor ashore, passed onboard through a fair-lead under the\r\nport end of the bridge, and made fast to bollards forward. Subsequent\r\nstrain due to ice and wind pressure on the ship broke three of the\r\nwires. Though I believe it was considered on board that the ship was\r\nsecure, there was still considerable anxiety felt. The anchors had held\r\nbadly before, and the power of the ice-pressure on the ship was\r\nuncomfortably obvious.\r\n\r\n“Since the ship had been moored the bay had frequently frozen over, and\r\nthe ice had as frequently gone out on account of blizzards. The ice\r\ndoes not always go out before the wind has passed its maximum. It\r\ndepends on the state of tides and currents; for the sea-ice has been\r\nseen more than once to go out bodily when a blizzard had almost\r\ncompletely calmed down.\r\n\r\n“On the 6th May the ice was in and people passed freely between the\r\nshore and the ship. At 11 p.m. the wind was south, backing to\r\nsouth-east, and blew at forty miles per hour. The ship was still in her\r\nplace. At 3 a.m. on the 7th the wind had not increased to any extent,\r\nbut ice and ship had gone. As she was not seen to go we are unable to\r\nsay whether the vessel was damaged. The shore end of the cable was bent\r\ntwice sharply, and the wires were loose. On the afternoon of the 7th\r\nthe weather cleared somewhat, but nothing was seen of the ship. The\r\nblizzard only lasted some twelve hours. Next day the wind became\r\nnortherly, but on the 10th there was blowing the fiercest blizzard we\r\nhave so far experienced from the south-east. Nothing has since been\r\nseen or heard of the ship, though a look-out was kept.\r\n\r\n“Immediately the ship went as accurate an inventory as possible of all\r\nstores ashore was made, and the rate of consumption of food-stuffs so\r\nregulated that they would last ten men for not less than one hundred\r\nweeks. Coal had already been used with the utmost economy. Little could\r\nbe done to cut down the consumption, but the transference to the\r\nneighbourhood of the hut of such of the coal landed previously by the\r\nship as was not lost was pushed on. Meat also was found to be very\r\nshort; it was obvious that neither it nor coal could be made to last\r\ntwo years, but an evidently necessary step in the ensuing summer would\r\nbe the ensuring of an adequate supply of meat and blubber, for\r\nobtaining which the winter presented little opportunity. Meat and coal\r\nwere, therefore, used with this consideration in mind, as required but\r\nas carefully as possible.\r\n\r\n“A. STEVENS.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe men ashore did not at once abandon hope of the ship returning\r\nbefore the Sound froze firmly. New ice formed on the sea whenever the\r\nweather was calm, and it had been broken up and taken out many times by\r\nthe blizzards. During the next few days eager eyes looked seaward\r\nthrough the dim twilight of noon, but the sea was covered with a dense\r\nblack mist and nothing was visible. A northerly wind sprang up on May 8\r\nand continued for a few hours, but it brought no sign of the ship, and\r\nwhen on May 10 the most violent blizzard yet experienced by the party\r\ncommenced, hope grew slender. The gale continued for three days, the\r\nwind attaining a velocity of seventy miles an hour. The snowdrift was\r\nvery thick and the temperature fell to –20° Fahr. The shore party took\r\na gloomy view of the ship’s chances of safety among the ice-floes of\r\nthe Ross Sea under such conditions.\r\n\r\nStevens and his companions made a careful survey of their position and\r\nrealized that they had serious difficulties to face. No general\r\nprovisions and no clothing of the kind required for sledging had been\r\nlanded from the ship. Much of the sledging gear was also aboard.\r\nFortunately, the hut contained both food and clothing, left there by\r\nCaptain Scott’s Expedition. The men killed as many seals as possible\r\nand stored the meat and blubber. June 2 brought a welcome addition to\r\nthe party in the form of the men who had been forced to remain at Hut\r\nPoint until the sea-ice became firm. Mackintosh and those with him had\r\nincurred some risk in making the crossing, since open water had been\r\nseen on their route by the Cape Evans party only a short time before.\r\nThere were now ten men at Cape Evans—namely, Mackintosh, Spencer-Smith,\r\nJoyce, Wild, Cope, Stevens, Hayward, Gaze, Jack, and Richards. The\r\nwinter had closed down upon the Antarctic and the party would not be\r\nable to make any move before the beginning of September. In the\r\nmeantime they overhauled the available stores and gear, made plans for\r\nthe work of the forthcoming spring and summer, and lived the severe but\r\nnot altogether unhappy life of the polar explorer in winter quarters.\r\nMackintosh, writing on June 5, surveyed his position:\r\n\r\n“The decision of Stenhouse to make this bay the wintering place of the\r\nship was not reached without much thought and consideration of all\r\neventualities. Stenhouse had already tried the Glacier Tongue and other\r\nplaces, but at each of them the ship had been in an exposed and\r\ndangerous position. When this bay was tried the ship withstood several\r\nsevere blizzards, in which the ice remained in on several occasions.\r\nWhen the ice did go out the moorings held. The ship was moored bows\r\nnorth. She had both anchors down forward and two anchors buried astern,\r\nto which the stern moorings were attached with seven lengths of wire.\r\nTaking all this into account, it was quite a fair judgment on his part\r\nto assume that the ship would be secure here. The blizzard that took\r\nthe ship and the ice out of the bay was by no means as severe as others\r\nshe had weathered. The accident proves again the uncertainty of\r\nconditions in these regions. I only pray and trust that the ship and\r\nthose aboard are safe. I am sure they will have a thrilling story to\r\ntell when we see them.”\r\n\r\nThe _Aurora_ could have found safe winter quarters farther up McMurdo\r\nSound, towards Hut Point, but would have run the risk of being frozen\r\nin over the following summer, and I had given instructions to\r\nMackintosh before he went south that this danger must be avoided.\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile we are making all preparations here for a prolonged stay.\r\nThe shortage of clothing is our principal hardship. The members of the\r\nparty from Hut Point have the clothes we wore when we left the ship on\r\nJanuary 25. We have been without a wash all that time, and I cannot\r\nimagine a dirtier set of people. We have been attempting to get a wash\r\never since we came back, but owing to the blow during the last two days\r\nno opportunity has offered. All is working smoothly here, and every one\r\nis taking the situation very philosophically. Stevens is in charge of\r\nthe scientific staff and is now the senior officer ashore. Joyce is in\r\ncharge of the equipment and has undertaken to improvise clothes out of\r\nwhat canvas can be found here. Wild is working with Joyce. He is a\r\ncheerful, willing soul. Nothing ever worries or upsets him, and he is\r\never singing or making some joke or performing some amusing prank.\r\nRichards has taken over the keeping of the meteorological log. He is a\r\nyoung Australian, a hard, conscientious worker, and I look forward to\r\ngood results from his endeavours. Jack, another young Australian, is\r\nhis assistant. Hayward is the handy man, being responsible for the\r\nsupply of blubber. Gaze, another Australian, is working in conjunction\r\nwith Hayward. Spencer-Smith, the _padre_, is in charge of photography,\r\nand, of course, assists in the general routine work. Cope is the\r\nmedical officer.\r\n\r\n“The routine here is as follows: Four of us, myself, Stevens, Richards,\r\nand Spencer-Smith, have breakfast at 7 a.m. The others are called at 9\r\na.m., and their breakfast is served. Then the table is cleared, the\r\nfloor is swept, and the ordinary work of the day is commenced. At 1\r\np.m. we have what we call ‘a counter lunch,’ that is, cold food and\r\ncocoa. We work from 2 p.m. till 5 p.m. After 5 p.m. people can do what\r\nthey like. Dinner is at 7. The men play games, read, write up diaries.\r\nWe turn in early, since we have to economize fuel and light.\r\nNight-watches are kept by the scientific men, who have the privilege of\r\nturning in during the day. The day after my arrival here I gave an\r\noutline of our situation and explained the necessity for economy in the\r\nuse of fuel, light, and stores, in view of the possibility that we may\r\nhave to stay here for two years.... We are not going to commence work\r\nfor the sledging operations until we know more definitely the fate of\r\nthe _Aurora_. I dare not think any disaster has occurred.”\r\n\r\nDuring the remaining days of June the men washed and mended clothes,\r\nkilled seals, made minor excursions in the neighbourhood of the hut,\r\nand discussed plans for the future. They had six dogs, two being\r\nbitches without experience of sledging. One of these bitches had given\r\nbirth to a litter of pups, but she proved a poor mother and the young\r\nones died. The animals had plenty of seal meat and were tended\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\nMackintosh called a meeting of all hands on June 26 for the discussion\r\nof the plans he had made for the depot-laying expedition to be\r\nundertaken during the following spring and summer.\r\n\r\n“I gave an outline of the position and invited discussion from the\r\nmembers. Several points were brought up. I had suggested that one of\r\nour party should remain behind for the purpose of keeping the\r\nmeteorological records and laying in a supply of meat and blubber. This\r\nman would be able to hand my instructions to the ship and pilot a party\r\nto the Bluff. It had been arranged that Richards should do this.\r\nSeveral objected on the ground that the whole complement would be\r\nnecessary, and, after the matter had been put to the vote, it was\r\nagreed that we should delay the decision until the parties had some\r\npractical work and we had seen how they fared. The shortage of clothing\r\nwas discussed, and Joyce and Wild have agreed to do their best in this\r\nmatter. October sledging (on the Barrier) was mentioned as being too\r\nearly, but is to be given a trial. These were the most important points\r\nbrought up, and it was mutually and unanimously agreed that we could do\r\nno more.... I know we are doing our best.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Newly-frozen Lead]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Ross Sea Party]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe party was anxious to visit Cape Royds, north of Cape Evans, but at\r\nthe end of June open water remained right across the Sound and a\r\ncrossing was impossible. At Cape Royds is the hut used by the\r\nShackleton Expedition of 1907–1909, and the stores and supplies it\r\ncontains might have proved very useful. Joyce and Wild made finneskoe\r\n(fur boots) from spare sleeping-bags. Mackintosh mentions that the\r\nnecessity of economizing clothing and footgear prevented the men taking\r\nas much exercise as they would otherwise have done. A fair supply of\r\ncanvas and leather had been found in the hut, and some men tried their\r\nhands at making shoes. Many seals had been killed and brought in, and\r\nthe supply of meat and blubber was ample for present needs.\r\n\r\nDuring July Mackintosh made several trips northwards on the sea-ice,\r\nbut found always that he could not get far. A crack stretched roughly\r\nfrom Inaccessible Island to the Barne Glacier, and the ice beyond\r\nlooked weak and loose. The improving light told of the returning sun.\r\nRichards and Jack were weighing out stores in readiness for the\r\nsledging expeditions. Mackintosh, from the hill behind the hut, saw\r\nopen water stretching westward from Inaccessible Island on August 1,\r\nand noted that probably McMurdo Sound was never completely frozen over.\r\nA week later the extent of the open water appeared to have increased,\r\nand the men began to despair of getting to Cape Royds. Blizzards were\r\nfrequent and persistent. A few useful articles were found in the\r\nneighbourhood of the hut as the light improved, including some\r\ndiscarded socks and underwear, left by members of the Scott Expedition,\r\nand a case of candied peel, which was used for cakes. A small fire\r\nbroke out in the hut on August 12. The acetylene-gas lighting plant\r\ninstalled in the hut by Captain Scott had been rigged, and one day it\r\ndeveloped a leak. A member of the party searched for the leak with a\r\nlighted candle, and the explosion that resulted fired some woodwork.\r\nFortunately the outbreak was extinguished quickly. The loss of the hut\r\nat this stage would have been a tragic incident.\r\n\r\nMackintosh and Stevens paid a visit to Cape Royds on August 13. They\r\nhad decided to attempt the journey over the Barne Glacier, and after\r\ncrossing a crevassed area they got to the slopes of Cape Barne and\r\nthence down to the sea-ice. They found this ice to be newly formed, but\r\nsufficiently strong for their purpose, and soon reached the Cape Royds\r\nhut.\r\n\r\n“The outer door of the hut we found to be off,” wrote Mackintosh. “A\r\nlittle snow had drifted into the porch, but with a shovel, which we\r\nfound outside, this was soon cleared away. We then entered, and in the\r\ncentre of the hut found a pile of snow and ice, which had come through\r\nthe open ventilator in the roof of the hut. We soon closed this.\r\nStevens prepared a meal while I cleared the ice and snow away from the\r\nmiddle of the hut. After our meal we commenced taking an inventory of\r\nthe stores inside. Tobacco was our first thought. Of this we found one\r\ntin of Navy Cut and a box of cigars. Soap, too, which now ensures us a\r\nwash and clean clothes when we get back. We then began to look round\r\nfor a sleeping-bag. No bags were here, however, but on the improvised\r\nbeds of cases we found two mattresses, an old canvas screen, and two\r\nblankets. We took it in turns to turn in. Stevens started first, while\r\nI kept the fire going. No coal or blubber was here, so we had to use\r\nwood, which, while keeping the person alongside it warm, did not raise\r\nthe temperature of the hut over freezing-point. Over the stove in a\r\nconspicuous place we found a notice by Scott’s party that parties using\r\nthe hut should leave the dishes clean.”\r\n\r\nMackintosh and Stevens stayed at the Cape Royds hut over the next day\r\nand made a thorough examination of the stores there. They found outside\r\nthe hut a pile of cases containing meats, flour, dried vegetables, and\r\nsundries, at least a year’s supply for a party of six. They found no\r\nnew clothing, but made a collection of worn garments, which could be\r\nmended and made serviceable. Carrying loads of their spoils, they set\r\nout for Cape Evans on the morning of August 15 across the sea-ice. Very\r\nweak ice barred the way and they had to travel round the coast. They\r\ngot back to Cape Evans in two hours. During their absence Wild and Gaze\r\nhad climbed Inaccessible Island, Gaze having an ear badly frost-bitten\r\non the journey. The tobacco was divided among the members of the party.\r\nA blizzard was raging the next day, and Mackintosh congratulated\r\nhimself on having chosen the time for his trip fortunately.\r\n\r\nThe record of the remaining part of August is not eventful. All hands\r\nwere making preparations for the sledging, and were rejoicing in the\r\nincreasing daylight. The party tried the special sledging ration\r\nprepared under my own direction, and “all agreed it was excellent both\r\nin bulk and taste.” Three emperor penguins, the first seen since the\r\nlanding, were caught on August 19. By that time the returning sun was\r\ntouching with gold the peaks of the Western Mountains and throwing into\r\nbold relief the massive form of Erebus. The volcano was emitting a\r\ngreat deal of smoke, and the glow of its internal fires showed\r\noccasionally against the smoke-clouds above the crater. Stevens,\r\nSpencer-Smith, and Cope went to Cape Royds on the 20th, and were still\r\nthere when the sun made its first appearance over Erebus on the 26th.\r\nPreceding days had been cloudy, and the sun, although above the\r\nhorizon, had not been visible.\r\n\r\n“The morning broke clear and fine,” wrote Mackintosh. “Over Erebus the\r\nsun’s rays peeped through the massed cumulus and produced the most\r\ngorgeous cloud effects. The light made us all blink and at the same\r\ntime caused the greatest exuberance of spirits. We felt like men\r\nreleased from prison. I stood outside the hut and looked at the truly\r\nwonderful scenery all round. The West Mountains were superb in their\r\nwild grandeur. The whole outline of peaks, some eighty or ninety\r\ndistant, showed up, stencilled in delicate contrast to the sky-line.\r\nThe immense ice-slopes shone white as alabaster against dark shadows.\r\nThe sky to the west over the mountains was clear, except for low-lying\r\nbanks at the foot of the slopes round about Mount Discovery. To the\r\nsouth hard streaks of stratus lay heaped up to 30 degrees above the\r\nhorizon.... Then Erebus commenced to emit volumes of smoke, which rose\r\nhundreds of feet and trailed away in a north-westerly direction. The\r\nsouthern slopes of Erebus were enveloped in a mass of cloud.” The party\r\nfrom Cape Royds returned that afternoon, and there was disappointment\r\nat their report that no more tobacco had been found.\r\n\r\nThe sledging of stores to Hut Point, in preparation for the\r\ndepot-laying journeys on the Barrier, was to begin on September 1.\r\nMackintosh, before that date, had discussed plans fully with the\r\nmembers of his party. He considered that sufficient sledging provisions\r\nwere available at Cape Evans, the supply landed from the ship being\r\nsupplemented by the stores left by the Scott Expedition of 1912–13 and\r\nthe Shackleton Expedition of 1907–09. The supply of clothing and tents\r\nwas more difficult. Garments brought from the ship could be\r\nsupplemented by old clothing found at Hut Point and Cape Evans. The\r\nBurberry wind-proof outer garments were old and in poor order for the\r\nstart of a season’s sledging. Old sleeping-bags had been cut up to make\r\nfinneskoe (fur boots) and mend other sleeping-bags. Three tents were\r\navailable, one sound one landed from the _Aurora_, and two old ones\r\nleft by Captain Scott. Mackintosh had enough sledges, but the\r\nexperience of the first journey with the dogs had been unfortunate, and\r\nthere were now only four useful dogs left. They did not make a full\r\nteam and would have to be used merely as an auxiliary to man-haulage.\r\n\r\nThe scheme adopted by Mackintosh, after discussion with the members of\r\nhis party, was that nine men, divided into three parties of three each,\r\nshould undertake the sledging. One man would be left at Cape Evans to\r\ncontinue the meteorological observations during the summer. The\r\nmotor-tractor, which had been left at Hut Point, was to be brought to\r\nCape Evans and, if possible, put into working order. Mackintosh\r\nestimated that the provisions required for the consumption of the depot\r\nparties, and for the depots to be placed southward to the foot of the\r\nBeardmore Glacier, would amount to 4000 lbs. The first depot was to be\r\nplaced off Minna Bluff, and from there southward a depot was to be\r\nplaced on each degree of latitude. The final depot would be made at the\r\nfoot of the Beardmore Glacier. The initial task would be the haulage of\r\nstores from Cape Evans to Hut Point, a distance of 13 miles. All the\r\nsledging stores had to be taken across, and Mackintosh proposed to\r\nplace additional supplies there in case a party, returning late from\r\nthe Barrier, had to spend winter months at Hut Point.\r\n\r\nThe first party, consisting of Mackintosh, Richards, and Spencer-Smith,\r\nleft Cape Evans on September 1 with 600 lbs. of stores on one sledge,\r\nand had an uneventful journey to Hut Point. They pitched a tent\r\nhalf-way across the bay, on the sea-ice, and left it there for the use\r\nof the various parties during the month. At Hut Point they cleared the\r\nsnow from the motor-tractor and made some preliminary efforts to get it\r\ninto working order. They returned to Cape Evans on the 3rd. The second\r\ntrip to Hut Point was made by a party of nine, with three sledges. Two\r\nsledges, man-hauled, were loaded with 1278 lbs. of stores, and a\r\nsmaller sledge, drawn by the dogs, carried the sleeping-bags. This\r\nparty encountered a stiff southerly breeze, with low temperature, and,\r\nas the men were still in rather soft condition, they suffered much from\r\nfrost bites. Joyce and Gaze both had their heels badly blistered.\r\nMackintosh’s face suffered, and other men had fingers and ears\r\n“bitten.” When they returned Gaze had to travel on a sledge, since he\r\ncould not set foot to the ground. They tried to haul the motor to Cape\r\nEvans on this occasion, but left it for another time after covering a\r\nmile or so. The motor was not working and was heavy to pull.\r\n\r\nEight men made the third journey to Hut Point, Gaze and Jack remaining\r\nbehind. They took 660 lbs. of oil and 630 lbs. of stores. From Hut\r\nPoint the next day (September 14) the party proceeded with loaded\r\nsledges to Safety Camp, on the edge of the Barrier. This camp would be\r\nthe starting-point for the march over the Barrier to the Minna Bluff\r\ndepot. They left the two sledges, with 660 lbs. of oil and 500 lbs. of\r\noatmeal, sugar, and sundries, at Safety Camp and returned to Hut Point.\r\nThe dogs shared the work on this journey. The next day Mackintosh and\r\nhis companions took the motor to Cape Evans, hauling it with its\r\ngrip-wheels mounted on a sledge. After a pause due to bad weather, a\r\nparty of eight men took another load to Hut Point on September 24, and\r\non to Safety Camp the next day. They got back to Cape Evans on the\r\n26th. Richards meanwhile had overhauled the motor and given it some\r\ntrial runs on the sea-ice. But he reported that the machine was not\r\nworking satisfactorily, and Mackintosh decided not to persevere with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Everybody is up to his eyes in work,” runs the last entry in the\r\njournal left by Mackintosh at Cape Evans. “All gear is being\r\noverhauled, and personal clothing is having the last stitches. We have\r\nbeen improvising shoes to replace the finneskoe, of which we are badly\r\nshort. Wild has made an excellent shoe out of an old horse-rug he found\r\nhere, and this is being copied by other men. I have made myself a pair\r\nof mitts out of an old sleeping-bag. Last night I had a bath, the\r\nsecond since being here.... I close this journal to-day (September 30)\r\nand am packing it with my papers here. To-morrow we start for Hut\r\nPoint. Nine of us are going on the sledge party for laying\r\ndepots—namely, Stevens, Spencer-Smith, Joyce, Wild, Cope, Hayward,\r\nJack, Richards, and myself. Gaze, who is still suffering from bad feet,\r\nis remaining behind and will probably be relieved by Stevens after our\r\nfirst trip. With us we take three months’ provisions to leave at Hut\r\nPoint. I continue this journal in another book, which I keep with me.”\r\n\r\nThe nine men reached Hut Point on October 1. They took the last loads\r\nwith them. Three sledges and three tents were to be taken on to the\r\nBarrier, and the parties were as follows:\r\n\r\nNo. 1: Mackintosh, Spencer-Smith, and Wild; No. 2: Joyce, Cope, and\r\nRichards; No. 3: Jack, Hayward, and Gaze. On October 3 and 4 some\r\nstores left at Half-Way Camp were brought in, and other stores were\r\nmoved on to Safety Camp. Bad weather delayed the start of the\r\ndepot-laying expedition from Hut Point until October 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\nLAYING THE DEPOTS\r\n\r\n\r\nMackintosh’s account of the depot-laying journeys undertaken by his\r\nparties in the summer of 1915–16 unfortunately is not available. The\r\nleader of the parties kept a diary, but he had the book with him when\r\nhe was lost on the sea-ice in the following winter. The narrative of\r\nthe journeys has been compiled from the notes kept by Joyce, Richards,\r\nand other members of the parties, and I may say here that it is a\r\nrecord of dogged endeavour in the face of great difficulties and\r\nserious dangers. It is always easy to be wise after the event, and one\r\nmay realize now that the use of the dogs, untrained and soft from\r\nshipboard inactivity, on the comparatively short journey undertaken\r\nimmediately after the landing in 1915 was a mistake. The result was the\r\nloss of nearly all the dogs before the longer and more important\r\njourneys of 1915–16 were undertaken. The men were sledging almost\r\ncontinuously during a period of six months; they suffered from\r\nfrost-bite, scurvy, snow-blindness, and the utter weariness of\r\novertaxed bodies. But the they placed the depots in the required\r\npositions, and if the Weddell Sea party had been able to make the\r\ncrossing of the Antarctic continent, the stores and fuel would have\r\nbeen waiting for us where we expected to find them.\r\n\r\nThe position on October 9 was that the nine men at Hut Point had with\r\nthem the stores required for the depots and for their own maintenance\r\nthroughout the summer. The remaining dogs were at Cape Evans with Gaze,\r\nwho had a sore heel and had been replaced temporarily by Stevens in the\r\nsledging party. A small quantity of stores had been conveyed already to\r\nSafety Camp on the edge of the Barrier beyond Hut Point. Mackintosh\r\nintended to form a large depot off Minna Bluff, seventy miles out from\r\nHut Point. This would necessitate several trips with heavy loads. Then\r\nhe would use the Bluff depot as a base for the journey to Mount Hope,\r\nat the foot of the Beardmore Glacier, where the final depot was to be\r\nlaid.\r\n\r\nThe party left Hut Point on the morning of October 9, the nine men\r\nhauling on one rope and trailing three loaded sledges. They reached\r\nSafety Camp in the early afternoon, and, after repacking the sledges\r\nwith a load of about 2000 lbs., they began the journey over the\r\nBarrier. The pulling proved exceedingly heavy, and they camped at the\r\nend of half a mile. It was decided next day to separate the sledges,\r\nthree men to haul each sledge. Mackintosh hoped that better progress\r\ncould be made in this way. The distance for the day was only four\r\nmiles, and the next day’s journey was no better. Joyce mentions that he\r\nhad never done harder pulling, the surface being soft, and the load\r\namounting to 220 lbs. per man. The new arrangement was not a success,\r\nowing to differences in hauling capacity and inequalities in the\r\nloading of the sledges; and on the morning of the 12th, Mackintosh,\r\nafter consultation, decided to push forward with Wild and\r\nSpencer-Smith, hauling one sledge and a relatively light load, and\r\nleave Joyce and the remaining five men to bring two sledges and the\r\nrest of the stores at their best pace. This arrangement was maintained\r\non the later journeys. The temperatures were falling below –30° Fahr.\r\nat some hours, and, as the men perspired freely while hauling their\r\nheavy loads in the sun, they suffered a great deal of discomfort in the\r\ndamp and freezing clothes at night. Joyce cut down his load on the 13th\r\nby depot-ing some rations and spare clothing, and made better progress.\r\nHe was building snow-cairns as guide-posts for use on the return\r\njourney. He mentions passing some large crevasses during succeeding\r\ndays. Persistent head winds with occasional drift made the conditions\r\nunpleasant and caused many frost-bites. When the surface was hard, and\r\nthe pulling comparatively easy, the men slipped and fell continually,\r\n“looking much like classical dancers.”\r\n\r\nOn the 20th a northerly wind made possible the use of a sail, and\r\nJoyce’s party made rapid progress. Jack sighted a bamboo pole during\r\nthe afternoon; and Joyce found that marked a depot he had laid for my\r\nown “Farthest South” party in 1908. He dug down in the hope of finding\r\nsome stores, but the depot had been cleared. The party reached the\r\nBluff depot on the evening of the 21st and found that Mackintosh had\r\nbeen there on the 19th. Mackintosh had left 178 lbs. of provisions, and\r\nJoyce left one sledge and 273 lbs. of stores. The most interesting\r\nincident of the return journey was the discovery of a note left by Mr.\r\nCherry Garrard for Captain Scott on March 19, 1912, only a few days\r\nbefore the latter perished at his camp farther south. An upturned\r\nsledge at this point was found to mark a depot of dog-biscuit and\r\nmotor-oil, laid by one of Captain Scott’s parties. Joyce reached Safety\r\nCamp on the afternoon of the 27th, and, after dumping all spare gear,\r\npushed on to Hut Point in a blizzard. The sledges nearly went over a\r\nbig drop at the edge of the Barrier, and a few moments later Stevens\r\ndropped down a crevasse to the length of his harness.\r\n\r\n“Had a tough job getting him up, as we had no alpine rope and had to\r\nuse harness,” wrote Joyce. “Got over all right and had a very hard pull\r\nagainst wind and snow, my face getting frost-bitten as I had to keep\r\nlooking up to steer. We arrived at the hut about 7.30 p.m. after a very\r\nhard struggle. We found the Captain and his party there. They had been\r\nin for three days. Gaze was also there with the dogs. We soon had a\r\ngood feed and forgot our hard day’s work.”\r\n\r\nMackintosh decided to make use of the dogs on the second journey to the\r\nBluff depot. He thought that with the aid of the dogs heavier loads\r\nmight be hauled. This plan involved the dispatch of a party to Cape\r\nEvans to get dog-pemmican. Mackintosh himself, with Wild and\r\nSpencer-Smith, started south again on October 29. Their sledge\r\noverturned on the slope down to the sea-ice, and the rim of their\r\ntent-spread was broken. The damage did not appear serious, and the\r\nparty soon disappeared round Cape Armitage. Joyce remained in charge at\r\nHut Point, with instructions to get dog food from Cape Evans and make a\r\nstart south as soon as possible. He sent Stevens, Hayward, and Cope to\r\nCape Evans the next day, and busied himself with the repair of\r\nsledging-gear. Cope, Hayward, and Gaze arrived back from Cape Evans on\r\nNovember 1, Stevens having stayed at the base. A blizzard delayed the\r\nstart southward, and the party did not get away until November 5. The\r\nmen pulled in harness with the four dogs, and, as the surface was soft\r\nand the loads on the two sledges were heavy, the advance was slow. The\r\nparty covered 5 miles 700 yards on the 6th, 4 miles 300 yards on the\r\n7th, and 8 miles 1800 yards on the 9th, with the aid of a light\r\nnortherly wind. They passed on the 9th a huge bergstrom, with a drop of\r\nabout 70 feet from the flat surface of the Barrier. Joyce thought that\r\na big crevasse had caved in. “We took some photographs,” wrote Joyce.\r\n“It is a really extraordinary fill-in of ice, with cliffs of blue ice\r\nabout 70 feet high, and heavily crevassed, with overhanging\r\nsnow-curtains. One could easily walk over the edge coming from the\r\nnorth in thick weather.” Another bergstrom, with crevassed ice around\r\nit, was encountered on the 11th. Joyce reached the Bluff depot on the\r\nevening of the 14th and found that he could leave 624 lbs. of\r\nprovisions. Mackintosh had been there several days earlier and had left\r\n188 lbs. of stores.\r\n\r\nJoyce made Hut Point again on November 20 after an adventurous day. The\r\nsurface was good in the morning and he pushed forward rapidly. About\r\n10.30 a.m. the party encountered heavy pressure-ice with crevasses, and\r\nhad many narrow escapes. “After lunch we came on four crevasses quite\r\nsuddenly. Jack fell through. We could not alter course, or else we\r\nshould have been steering among them, so galloped right across. We were\r\ngoing so fast that the dogs that went through were jerked out. It came\r\non very thick at 2 p.m. Every bit of land was obscured, and it was hard\r\nto steer. Decided to make for Hut Point, and arrived at 6.30 p.m.,\r\nafter doing twenty-two miles, a very good performance. I had a bad\r\nattack of snow-blindness and had to use cocaine. Hayward also had a bad\r\ntime. I was laid up and had to keep my eyes bandaged for three days.\r\nHayward, too.” The two men were about again on November 24, and the\r\nparty started south on its third journey to the Bluff on the 25th.\r\nMackintosh was some distance ahead, but the two parties met on the 28th\r\nand had some discussion as to plans. Mackintosh was proceeding to the\r\nBluff depot with the intention of taking a load of stores to the depot\r\nplaced on lat. 80° S. in the first season’s sledging. Joyce, after\r\ndepositing his third load at the Bluff, would return to Hut Point for a\r\nfourth and last load, and the parties would then join forces for the\r\njourney southward to Mount Hope.\r\n\r\nJoyce left 729 lbs. at the Bluff depot on December 2, reached Hut Point\r\non December 7, and, after allowing dogs and men a good rest, he moved\r\nsouthward again on December 13. This proved to be the worst journey the\r\nparty had made. The men had much trouble with crevasses, and they were\r\nheld up by blizzards on December 16, 18, 19, 22, 23, 26, and 27. They\r\nspent Christmas Day struggling through soft snow against an icy wind\r\nand drift. The party reached the Bluff depot on December 28, and found\r\nthat Mackintosh, who had been much delayed by the bad weather, had gone\r\nsouth two days earlier on his way to the 80° S. depot. He had not made\r\nmuch progress and his camp was in sight. He had left instructions for\r\nJoyce to follow him. The Bluff depot was now well stocked. Between 2800\r\nand 2900 lbs. of provisions had been dragged to the depot for the use\r\nof parties working to the south of this point. This quantity was in\r\naddition to stores placed there earlier in the year.\r\n\r\nJoyce left the Bluff depot on December 29, and the parties were\r\ntogether two days later. Mackintosh handed Joyce instructions to\r\nproceed with his party to lat. 81° S and place a depot there. He was\r\nthen to send three men back to Hut Point and proceed to lat. 82° S.,\r\nwhere he would lay another depot. Then if provisions permitted he would\r\npush south as far as lat. 83°. Mackintosh himself was reinforcing the\r\ndepot at lat. 80° S. and would then carry on southward. Apparently his\r\ninstructions to Joyce were intended to guard against the contingency of\r\nthe parties failing to meet. The dogs were hauling well, and though\r\ntheir number was small they were of very great assistance. The parties\r\nwere now ninety days out from Cape Evans, and “all hands were feeling\r\nfit.”\r\n\r\nThe next incident of importance was the appearance of a defect in one\r\nof the two Primus lamps used by Joyce’s party. The lamps had all seen\r\nservice with one or other of Captain Scott’s parties, and they had not\r\nbeen in first-class condition when the sledging commenced. The\r\nthreatened failure of a lamp was a matter of grave moment, since a\r\nparty could not travel without the means of melting snow and preparing\r\nhot food. If Joyce took a faulty lamp past the 80° S. depot, his whole\r\nparty might have to turn back at lat. 81° S., and this would imperil\r\nthe success of the season’s sledging. He decided, therefore, to send\r\nthree men back from the 80° S. depot, which he reached on January 6,\r\n1916. Cope, Gaze, and Jack were the men to return. They took the\r\ndefective Primus and a light load, and by dint of hard travelling,\r\nwithout the aid of dogs, they reached Cape Evans on January 16.\r\n\r\nJoyce, Richards, and Hayward went forward with a load of 1280 lbs.,\r\ncomprising twelve weeks’ sledging rations, dog food and depot supplies,\r\nin addition to the sledging-gear. They built cairns at short intervals\r\nas guides to the depots. Joyce was feeding the dogs well and giving\r\nthem a hot hoosh every third night. “It is worth it for the wonderful\r\namount of work they are doing. If we can keep them to 82° S. I can\r\nhonestly say it is through their work we have got through.” On January\r\n8 Mackintosh joined Joyce, and from that point the parties, six men\r\nstrong, went forward together. They marched in thick weather during\r\nJanuary 10, 11, and 12, keeping the course by means of cairns, with a\r\nscrap of black cloth on top of each one. It was possible, by keeping\r\nthe cairns in line behind the sledges and building new ones as old ones\r\ndisappeared, to march on an approximately straight line. On the evening\r\nof the 12th they reached lat. 81° S., and built a large cairn for the\r\ndepot. The stores left here were three weeks’ rations for the ordinary\r\nsledging unit of three men. This quantity would provide five days’\r\nrations for twelve men, half for the use of the overland party, and\r\nhalf for the depot party on its return journey.\r\n\r\nThe party moved southwards again on January 13 in bad weather.\r\n\r\n“After a little consultation we decided to get under way,” wrote Joyce.\r\n“Although the weather is thick, and snow is falling, it is worth while\r\nto make the effort. A little patience with the direction and the\r\ncairns, even if one has to put them up 200 yds. apart, enables us to\r\nadvance, and it seems that this weather will never break. We have cut\r\nup an old pair of trousers belonging to Richards to place on the sides\r\nof the cairns, so as to make them more prominent. It was really\r\nsurprising to find how we got on in spite of the snow and the pie-crust\r\nsurface. We did 5 miles 75 yds. before lunch. The dogs are doing\r\nsplendidly. I really don’t know how we should manage if it were not for\r\nthem.... The distance for the day was 10 miles 720 yds., a splendid\r\nperformance considering surface and weather.”\r\n\r\nThe weather cleared on the 14th; and the men were able to get bearings\r\nfrom the mountains to the westward. They advanced fairly rapidly during\r\nsucceeding days, the daily distances being from ten to twelve miles,\r\nand reached lat. 82° S. on the morning of January 18. The depot here,\r\nlike the depot at 81° S., contained five days’ provisions for twelve\r\nmen. Mackintosh was having trouble with the Primus lamp in his tent,\r\nand this made it inadvisable to divide the party again. It was decided,\r\ntherefore, that all should proceed, and that the next and last depot\r\nshould be placed on the base of Mount Hope, at the foot of the\r\nBeardmore Glacier, in lat. 83° 30´ S. The party proceeded at once and\r\nadvanced five miles beyond the depot before camping on the evening of\r\nthe 18th.\r\n\r\nThe sledge loads were now comparatively light, and on the 19th the\r\nparty covered 13 miles 700 yds. A new trouble was developing, for\r\nSpencer-Smith was suffering from swollen and painful legs, and was\r\nunable to do much pulling. Joyce wrote on the 21st that Smith was\r\nworse, and that Mackintosh was showing signs of exhaustion. A mountain\r\nthat he believed to be Mount Hope could be seen right ahead, over\r\nthirty miles away. Spencer-Smith, who had struggled forward gamely and\r\nmade no unnecessary complaints, started with the party the next morning\r\nand kept going until shortly before noon. Then he reported his\r\ninability to proceed, and Mackintosh called a halt. Spencer-Smith\r\nsuggested that he should be left with provisions and a tent while the\r\nother members of the party pushed on to Mount Hope, and pluckily\r\nassured Mackintosh that the rest would put him right and that he would\r\nbe ready to march when they returned. The party agreed, after a brief\r\nconsultation, to adopt this plan. Mackintosh felt that the depot must\r\nbe laid, and that delay would be dangerous. Spencer-Smith was left with\r\na tent, one sledge, and provisions, and told to expect the returning\r\nparty in about a week. The tent was made as comfortable as possible\r\ninside, and food was placed within the sick man’s reach. Spencer-Smith\r\nbade his companions a cheery good-bye after lunch, and the party was\r\nsix or seven miles away before evening. Five men had to squeeze into\r\none tent that night, but with a minus temperature they did not object\r\nto being crowded.\r\n\r\nOn January 23 a thick fog obscured all landmarks, and as bearings of\r\nthe mountains were now necessary the party had to camp at 11 a.m.,\r\nafter travelling only four miles. The thick weather continued over the\r\n24th, and the men did not move again until the morning of the 25th.\r\nThey did 17¾ miles that day, and camped at 6 p.m. on the edge of “the\r\nbiggest ice-pressure” Joyce had ever seen. They were steering in\r\ntowards the mountains and were encountering the tremendous congestion\r\ncreated by the flow of the Beardmore Glacier into the barrier ice.\r\n\r\n“We decided to keep the camp up,” ran Joyce’s account of the work done\r\non January 26. “Skipper, Richards, and myself roped ourselves together,\r\nI taking the lead, to try and find a course through this pressure. We\r\ncame across very wide crevasses, went down several, came on top of a\r\nvery high ridge, and such a scene! Imagine thousands of tons of ice\r\nchurned up to a depth of about 300 ft. We took a couple of photographs,\r\nthen carried on to the east. At last we found a passage through, and\r\ncarried on through smaller crevasses to Mount Hope, or we hoped it was\r\nthe mountain by that name. We can see a great glacier ahead which we\r\ntake for the Beardmore, which this mountain is on, but the position on\r\nthe chart seems wrong. [It was not.—E.H.S.] We nearly arrived at the\r\nice-foot when Richards saw something to the right, which turned out to\r\nbe two of Captain Scott’s sledges, upright, but three-quarters buried\r\nin snow. Then we knew for certain this was the place we had struggled\r\nto get to. So we climbed the glacier on the slope and went up about one\r\nand a quarter miles, and saw the great Beardmore Glacier stretching to\r\nthe south. It is about twenty-five miles wide—a most wonderful sight.\r\nThen we returned to our camp, which we found to be six miles away. We\r\nleft at 8 a.m. and arrived back at 3 p.m., a good morning’s work. We\r\nthen had lunch. About 4 p.m. we got under way and proceeded with the\r\ntwo sledges and camped about 7 o’clock. Wild, Hayward and myself then\r\ntook the depot up the Glacier, a fortnight’s provisions. We left it\r\nlashed to a broken sledge and put up a large flag. I took two\r\nphotographs of it. We did not arrive back until 10.30 p.m. It was\r\nrather a heavy pull up. I was very pleased to see our work completed at\r\nlast.... Turned in 12 o’clock. The distance done during day 22 miles.”\r\n\r\nThe party remained in camp until 3.30 p.m. on the 27th, owing to a\r\nblizzard with heavy snow. Then they made a start in clearer weather and\r\ngot through the crevassed area before camping at 7 p.m. Joyce was\r\nsuffering from snow-blindness. They were now homeward bound, with 365\r\nmiles to go. They covered 16½ miles on the 28th, with Joyce absolutely\r\nblind and hanging to the harness for guidance, “but still pulling his\r\nwhack.” They reached Spencer-Smith’s camp the next afternoon and found\r\nhim in his sleeping-bag, quite unable to walk. Joyce’s diary of this\r\ndate contains a rather gloomy reference to the outlook, since he\r\nguessed that Mackintosh also would be unable to make the homeward\r\nmarch. “The dogs are still keeping fit,” he added. “If they will only\r\nlast to 80° S. we shall then have enough food to take them in, and then\r\nif the ship is in I guarantee they will live in comfort the remainder\r\nof their lives.”\r\n\r\nNo march could be made on the 30th, since a blizzard was raging. The\r\nparty made 8 miles on the 31st, with Spencer-Smith on one of the\r\nsledges in his sleeping-bag. The sufferer was quite helpless, and had\r\nto be lifted and carried about, but his courage did not fail him. His\r\nwords were cheerful even when his physical suffering and weakness were\r\nmost pronounced. The distance for February 1 was 13 miles. The next\r\nmorning the party abandoned one sledge in order to lighten the load,\r\nand proceeded with a single sledge, Spencer-Smith lying on top of the\r\nstores and gear. The distance for the day was 15½ miles. They picked up\r\nthe 82° S. depot on February 3, and took one week’s provisions, leaving\r\ntwo weeks’ rations for the overland party. Joyce, Wild, Richards, and\r\nHayward were feeling fit. Mackintosh was lame and weak; Spencer-Smith’s\r\ncondition was alarming. The party was being helped by strong southerly\r\nwinds, and the distances covered were decidedly good. The sledge-meter\r\nrecorded 15 miles 1700 yds. on February 4, 17 miles 1400 yds. on the\r\n5th, 18 miles 1200 yds. on the 6th, and 13 miles 1000 yds. on the 7th,\r\nwhen the 81° S. depot was picked up at 10.30 a.m., and one week’s\r\nstores taken, two weeks’ rations being left.\r\n\r\nThe march to the next depot, at 80° S., was uneventful. The party made\r\ngood marches in spite of bad surfaces and thick weather, and reached\r\nthe depot late in the afternoon of February 12. The supply of stores at\r\nthis depot was ample, and the men took a fortnight’s rations\r\n(calculated on a three-man basis), leaving nearly four weeks’ rations.\r\nSpencer-Smith seemed a little better, and all hands were cheered by the\r\nrapid advance. February 14, 15, and 16 were bad days, the soft surface\r\nallowing the men to sink to their knees at times. The dogs had a rough\r\ntime, and the daily distances fell to about eight miles. Mackintosh’s\r\nweakness was increasing. Then on the 18th, when the party was within\r\ntwelve miles of the Bluff depot, a furious blizzard made travelling\r\nimpossible. This blizzard raged for five days. Rations were reduced on\r\nthe second day, and the party went on half-rations the third day.\r\n\r\n“Still blizzarding,” wrote Joyce on the 20th. “Things are serious, what\r\nwith our patient and provisions running short. Dog provisions are\r\nnearly out, and we have to halve their rations. We are now on one cup\r\nof hoosh among the three of us, with one biscuit and six lumps of\r\nsugar. The most serious of calamities is that our oil is running out.\r\nWe have plenty of tea, but no fuel to cook it with.” The men in\r\nMackintosh’s tent were in no better plight. Mackintosh himself was in a\r\nbad way. He was uncertain about his ability to resume the march, but\r\nwas determined to try.\r\n\r\n“Still blizzarding,” wrote Joyce again on the 21st. “We are lying in\r\npools of water made by our bodies through staying in the same place for\r\nsuch a long time. I don’t know what we shall do if this does not ease.\r\nIt has been blowing continuously without a lull. The food for to-day\r\nwas one cup of pemmican amongst three of us, one biscuit each, and two\r\ncups of tea among the three.” The kerosene was exhausted, but Richards\r\nimprovised a lamp by pouring some spirit (intended for priming the\r\noil-lamp) into a mug, lighting it, and holding another mug over it. It\r\ntook half an hour to heat a mug of melted snow in this way. “Same old\r\nthing, no ceasing of this blizzard,” was Joyce’s note twenty-four hours\r\nlater. “Hardly any food left except tea and sugar. Richards, Hayward,\r\nand I, after a long talk, decided to get under way to-morrow in any\r\ncase, or else we shall be sharing the fate of Captain Scott and his\r\nparty. The other tent seems to be very quiet, but now and again we hear\r\na burst of song from Wild, so they are in the land of the living. We\r\ngave the dogs the last of their food to-night, so we shall have to\r\npush, as a great deal depends on them.” Further quotations from Joyce’s\r\ndiary tell their own story.\r\n\r\n“_February_ 23, _Wednesday_.—About 11 o’clock saw a break in the clouds\r\nand the sun showing. Decided to have the meal we kept for getting under\r\nway. Sang out to the Skipper’s party that we should shift as soon as we\r\nhad a meal. I asked Wild, and found they had a bag of oatmeal, some\r\nBovril cubes, one bag of chocolate, and eighteen biscuits, so they are\r\nmuch better off than we are. After we had our meal we started to dig\r\nout our sledge, which we found right under. It took us two hours, and\r\none would hardly credit how weak we were. Two digs of the shovel and we\r\nwere out of breath. This was caused through our lying up on practically\r\nno food. After getting sledge out we took it around to the Skipper’s\r\ntent on account of the heavy sastrugi, which was very high. Got under\r\nway about 2.20. Had to stop very often on account of sail, etc. About\r\n3.20 the Skipper, who had tied himself to the rear of the sledge, found\r\nit impossible to proceed. So after a consultation with Wild and party,\r\ndecided to pitch their tent, leaving Wild to look after the Skipper and\r\nSpencer-Smith, and make the best of our way to the depot, which is\r\nanything up to twelve miles away. So we made them comfortable and left\r\nthem about 3.40. I told Wild I should leave as much as possible and get\r\nback 26th or 27th, weather permitting, but just as we left them it came\r\non to snow pretty hard, sun going in, and we found even with the four\r\ndogs we could not make more than one-half to three-quarters of a mile\r\nan hour. The surface is so bad that sometimes you go in up to your\r\nwaist; still in spite of all this we carried on until 6.35. Camped in a\r\nhowling blizzard. I found my left foot badly frost-bitten. Now after\r\nthis march we came into our banquet—one cup of tea and half a biscuit.\r\nTurned in at 9 o’clock. Situation does not look very cheerful. This is\r\nreally the worst surface I have ever come across in all my journeys\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nMackintosh had stayed on his feet as long as was humanly possible. The\r\nrecords of the outward journey show clearly that he was really unfit to\r\ncontinue beyond the 82° S. depot, and other members of the party would\r\nhave liked him to have stayed with Spencer-Smith at lat. 83° S. But the\r\nresponsibility for the work to be done was primarily his, and he would\r\nnot give in. He had been suffering for several weeks from what he\r\ncheerfully called “a sprained leg,” owing to scurvy. He marched for\r\nhalf an hour on the 23rd before breaking down, but had to be supported\r\npartly by Richards. Spencer-Smith was sinking. Wild, who stayed in\r\ncharge of the two invalids, was in fairly good condition. Joyce,\r\nRichards, and Hayward, who had undertaken the relief journey, were all\r\nshowing symptoms of scurvy, though in varying degrees. Their legs were\r\nweak, their gums swollen. The decision that the invalids, with Wild,\r\nshould stay in camp from February 24, while Joyce’s party pushed\r\nforward to Bluff depot, was justified fully by the circumstances.\r\nJoyce, Richards, and Hayward had difficulty in reaching the depot with\r\na nearly empty sledge. An attempt to make their journey with two\r\nhelpless men might have involved the loss of the whole party.\r\n\r\n“_February_ 24, _Thursday_.—Up at 4:30; had one cup of tea, half\r\nbiscuit; under way after 7. Weather, snowing and blowing like\r\nyesterday. Richards, laying the cairns had great trouble in getting the\r\ncompass within 10° on account of wind. During the forenoon had to stop\r\nevery quarter of an hour on account of our breath. Every time the\r\nsledge struck a drift she stuck in (although only 200 lbs.), and in\r\nspite of three men and four dogs we could only shift her with the 1—2—3\r\nhaul. I wonder if this weather will ever clear up. Camped in an\r\nexhausted condition about 12.10. Lunch, half cup of weak tea and\r\nquarter biscuit, which took over half an hour to make. Richards and\r\nHayward went out of tent to prepare for getting under way, but the\r\nforce of wind and snow drove them back. The force of wind is about\r\nseventy to eighty miles per hour. We decided to get the sleeping-bags\r\nin, which took some considerable time. The worst of camping is the poor\r\ndogs and our weak condition, which means we have to get out of our wet\r\nsleeping-bags and have another half cup of tea without working for it.\r\nWith scrapings from dog-tank it is a very scanty meal. This is the\r\nsecond day the dogs have been without food, and if we cannot soon pick\r\nup depot and save the dogs it will be almost impossible to drag our two\r\ninvalids back the one hundred miles which we have to go. The wind\r\ncarried on with unabating fury until 7 o’clock, and then came a lull.\r\nWe at once turned out, but found it snowing so thickly that it was\r\nimpossible to proceed on account of our weakness. No chance must we\r\nmiss. Turned in again. Wind sprang up again with heavy drift 8.30. In\r\nspite of everything my tent-mates are very cheerful and look on the\r\nbright side of everything. After a talk we decided to wait and turned\r\nin. It is really wonderful what dreams we have, especially of food.\r\nTrusting in Providence for fine weather to-morrow.\r\n\r\n“_February_ 25, _Friday_.—Turned out 4.45. Richards prepared our usual\r\nbanquet, half cup of tea, quarter biscuit, which we relished. Under way\r\nat 7, carried on, halting every ten minutes or quarter of an hour.\r\nWeather, snowing and blowing same as yesterday. We are in a very weak\r\nstate, but we cannot give in. We often talk about poor Captain Scott\r\nand the blizzard that finished him and party. If we had stayed in our\r\ntent another day I don’t think we should have got under way at all, and\r\nwe would have shared the same fate. But if the worst comes we have made\r\nup our minds to carry on and die in harness. If any one were to see us\r\non trek they would be surprised, three men staggering on with four\r\ndogs, very weak; practically empty sledge with fair wind and just\r\ncrawling along; our clothes are all worn out, finneskoe and sleeping\r\nbags torn. Tent is our worst point, all torn in front, and we are\r\nafraid to camp on account of it, as it is too cold to mend it. We\r\ncamped for our grand lunch at noon. After five hours’ struggling I\r\nthink we did about three miles. After lunch sat in our tent talking\r\nover the situation. Decided to get under way again as soon as there is\r\nany clearance. Snowing and blowing, force about fifty or sixty miles an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n“_February_ 26, _Saturday_.—Richards went out 1.10 a.m. and found it\r\nclearing a bit, so we got under way as soon as possible, which was 2.10\r\na.m. About 2.35 Richards sighted depot, which seemed to be right on top\r\nof us. I suppose we camped no more than three-quarters of a mile from\r\nit. The dogs sighted it, which seemed to electrify them. They had new\r\nlife and started to run, but we were so weak that we could not go more\r\nthan 200 yds. and then spell. I think another day would have seen us\r\noff. Arrived at depot 3.25; found it in a dilapidated condition, cases\r\nall about the place. I don’t suppose there has ever been a weaker party\r\narrive at any depot, either north or south. After a hard struggle got\r\nour tent up and made camp. Then gave the dogs a good feed of pemmican.\r\nIf ever dogs saved the lives of any one they have saved ours. Let us\r\nhope they will continue in good health, so that we can get out to our\r\ncomrades. I started on our cooking. Not one of us had any appetite,\r\nalthough we were in the land of plenty, as we call this depot; plenty\r\nof biscuit, etc., but we could not eat. I think it is the reaction, not\r\nonly in arriving here, but also finding no news of the ship, which was\r\narranged before we left. We all think there has been a calamity there.\r\nLet us hope for the best. We decided to have rolled-oats and milk for a\r\nstart, which went down very well, and then a cup of tea. How cheery the\r\nPrimus sounds. It seems like coming out of a thick London fog into a\r\ndrawing-room. After a consultation we decided to have a meal of\r\npemmican in four hours, and so on, until our weakness was gone.\r\n_Later_.—Still the same weather. We shall get under way and make a\r\nforced march back as soon as possible. I think we shall get stronger\r\ntravelling and feeding well. _Later_.—Weather will not permit us to\r\ntravel yet. Mended our torn tent with food-bags. This took four hours.\r\nFeeding the dogs every four hours, and Richards and Hayward built up\r\ndepot. It is really surprising to find it takes two men to lift a\r\n50-lb. case; it only shows our weakness. Weather still the same; force\r\nof wind at times about seventy to ninety miles an hour; really\r\nsurprising how this can keep on so long.\r\n\r\n“_February_ 27, _Sunday_.—Wind continued with fury the whole night.\r\nExpecting every minute to have the tent blown off us. Up 5 o’clock;\r\nfound it so thick one could not get out of the tent. We are still very\r\nweak, but think we can do the twelve miles to our comrades in one long\r\nmarch. If only it would clear up for just one day we would not mind.\r\nThis is the longest continuous blizzard I have ever been in. We have\r\nnot had a travelling day for eleven days, and the amount of snow that\r\nhas fallen is astonishing. _Later_.—Had a meal 10.30 and decided to get\r\nunder way in spite of the wind and snow. Under way 12 o’clock. We have\r\nthree weeks’ food on sledge, about 160 lbs., and one week’s dog-food,\r\n50 lbs. The whole weight, all told, about 600 lbs., and also taking an\r\nextra sledge to bring back Captain Mackintosh. To our surprise we could\r\nnot shift the sledges. After half an hour we got about ten yards. We\r\nturned the sledge up and scraped runners; it went a little better\r\nafter. I am afraid our weakness is much more than we think. Hayward is\r\nin rather a bad way about his knees, which are giving him trouble and\r\nare very painful; we will give him a good massage when we camp. The\r\ndogs have lost all heart in pulling; they seem to think that going\r\nsouth again is no good to them; they seem to just jog along, and one\r\ncannot do more. I don’t suppose our pace is more than one-half or\r\nthree-quarters of a mile per hour. The surface is rotten, snow up to\r\none’s knees, and what with wind and drift a very bad outlook. Lunched\r\nabout 4.30. Carried on until 11.20, when we camped. It was very dark\r\nmaking our dinner, but soon got through the process. Then Richards\r\nspent an hour or so in rubbing Hayward with methylated spirits, which\r\ndid him a world of good. If he were to break up now I should not know\r\nwhat to do. Turned in about 1.30. It is now calm, but overcast with\r\nlight falling snow.\r\n\r\n“_February_ 28, _Monday_.—Up at 6 o’clock; can just see a little\r\nsky-line. Under way at 9 o’clock. The reason of delay, had to mend\r\nfinneskoe, which are in a very dilapidated condition. I got my feet\r\nbadly frost-bitten yesterday. About 11 o’clock came on to snow,\r\neverything overcast. We ought to reach our poor boys in three or four\r\nhours, but Fate wills otherwise, as it came on again to blizzard force\r\nabout 11.45. Camped at noon. I think the party must be within a very\r\nshort distance, but we cannot go on as we might pass them, and as we\r\nhave not got any position to go on except compass. _Later_.—Kept on\r\nblizzarding all afternoon and night.\r\n\r\n“_February_ 29, _Tuesday_.—Up at 5 o’clock; still very thick. It\r\ncleared up a little to the south about 8 o’clock, when Richards sighted\r\nsomething black to the north of us, but could not see properly what it\r\nwas. After looking round sighted camp to the south, so we got under way\r\nas soon as possible. Got up to the camp about 12.45, when Wild came out\r\nto meet us. We gave him a cheer, as we fully expected to find all down.\r\nHe said he had taken a little exercise every day; they had not any food\r\nleft. The Skipper then came out of the tent, very weak and as much as\r\nhe could do to walk. He said, ‘I want to thank you for saving our\r\nlives.’ I told Wild to go and give them a feed and not to eat too much\r\nat first in case of reaction, as I am going to get under way as soon as\r\nthey have had a feed. So we had lunch, and the Skipper went ahead to\r\nget some exercise, and after an hour’s digging out got everything ready\r\nfor leaving. When we lifted Smith we found he was in a great hole which\r\nhe had melted through. This party had been in one camp for twelve days.\r\nWe got under way and picked the Skipper up; he had fallen down, too\r\nweak to walk. We put him on the sledge we had brought out, and we\r\ncamped about 8 o’clock. I think we did about three miles, rather good\r\nwith two men on the sledges and Hayward in a very bad way. I don’t\r\nthink there has been a party, either north or south, in such straits,\r\nthree men down and three of us very weak; but the dogs seem to have new\r\nlife since we turned north. I think they realize they are homeward\r\nbound. I am glad we kept them, even when we were starving. I knew they\r\nwould have to come in at the finish. We have now to look forward to\r\nsoutherly winds for help, which I think we shall get at this time of\r\nyear. Let us hope the temperature will keep up, as our sleeping-bags\r\nare wet through and worn out, and all our clothes full of holes, and\r\nfinneskoe in a dilapidated condition; in fact, one would not be out on\r\na cold day in civilization with the rotten clothes we have on. Turned\r\nin 11 o’clock, wet through, but in a better frame of mind. Hope to try\r\nand reach the depot to-morrow, even if we have to march overtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mackintosh and Spencer-Smith being dragged on the\r\nsledge]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “The Rudder was bent over to Starboard and Smashed”]\r\n\r\n\r\n“_March_ 1, _Wednesday_.—Turned out usual time; a good south wind, but,\r\nworse luck, heavy drift. Set sail; put the Skipper on rear sledge. The\r\ntemperature has gone down and it is very cold. Bluff in sight. We are\r\nmaking good progress, doing a good mileage before lunch. After lunch a\r\nlittle stronger wind. Hayward still hanging on to sledge; Skipper fell\r\noff twice. Reached depot 5.45. When camping found we had dropped our\r\ntent-poles, so Richards went back a little way and spotted them through\r\nthe binoculars about half a mile off, and brought them back. Hayward\r\nand I were very cold by that time, the drift very bad. Moral: See\r\neverything properly secured. We soon had our tent up, cooked our dinner\r\nin the dark, and turned in about 10 o’clock.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 2, _Thursday_.—Up as usual. Strong south-west wind with heavy\r\ndrift. Took two weeks’ provisions from the depot. I think that will\r\nlast us through, as there is another depot about fifty miles north from\r\nhere; I am taking the outside course on account of the crevasses, and\r\none cannot take too many chances with two men on sledges and one\r\ncrippled. Under way about 10 o’clock; lunched noon in a heavy drift;\r\ntook an hour to get the tents up, etc., the wind being so heavy. Found\r\nsledges buried under snow after lunch, took some time to get under way.\r\nWind and drift very heavy; set half-sail on the first sledge and under\r\nway about 3.30. The going is perfect; sometimes sledges overtaking us.\r\nCarried on until 8 o’clock, doing an excellent journey for the day;\r\ndistance about eleven or twelve miles. Gives one a bit of heart to\r\ncarry on like this; only hope we can do this all the way. Had to cook\r\nour meals in the dark, but still we did not mind. Turned in about 11\r\no’clock, pleased with ourselves, although we were wet through with\r\nsnow, as it got through all the holes in our clothes, and the\r\nsleeping-bags are worse than awful.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 3, _Friday_.—Up the usual time. It has been blowing a raging\r\nblizzard all night. Found to our disgust utterly impossible to carry\r\non. Another few hours of agony in these rotten bags. _Later_.—Blizzard\r\nmuch heavier. Amused myself mending finneskoe and Burberrys, mitts and\r\nsocks. Had the Primus while this operation was in force. Hoping for a\r\nfine day to-morrow.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 4, _Saturday_.—Up 5.20. Still blizzarding, but have decided to\r\nget under way as we will have to try and travel through everything, as\r\nHayward is getting worse, and one doesn’t know who is the next. No\r\nmistake it is scurvy, and the only possible cure is fresh food. I\r\nsincerely hope the ship is in; if not we shall get over the hills by\r\nCastle Rock, which is rather difficult and will delay another couple of\r\ndays. Smith is still cheerful; he has hardly moved for weeks and he has\r\nto have everything done for him. Got under way 9.35. It took some two\r\nhours to dig out dogs and sledges, as they were completely buried. It\r\nis the same every morning now. Set sail, going along pretty fair.\r\nHayward gets on sledge now and again. Lunched as usual; sledges got\r\nburied again at lunch-time. It takes some time to camp now, and in this\r\ndrift it is awful. In the afternoon wind eased a bit and drift went\r\ndown. Found it very hard pulling with the third man on sledge, as\r\nHayward has been on all the afternoon. Wind veered two points to south,\r\nso we had a fair wind. An hour before we camped Erebus and Terror\r\nshowing up, a welcome sight. Only hope wind will continue. Drift is\r\nworst thing to contend with as it gets into our clothes, which are wet\r\nthrough now. Camped 8 o’clock. Cooked in the dark, and turned in in our\r\nwet sleeping-bags about 10 o’clock. Distance about eight or nine miles.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 5, _Sunday_.—Turned out 6.15. Overslept a little; very tired\r\nafter yesterday. Sun shining brightly and no wind. It seemed strange\r\nlast night, no flapping of tent in one’s ears. About 8.30 came on to\r\ndrift again. Under way 9.20, both sails set. Sledge going hard,\r\nespecially in soft places. If Hayward had not broken down we should not\r\nfeel the weight so much. Lunch 12.45. Under way at 3. Wind and drift\r\nvery heavy. A good job it is blowing some, or else we should have to\r\nrelay. All land obscured. Distance about ten or eleven miles, a very\r\ngood performance. Camped 7.10 in the dark. Patients not in the best of\r\ntrim. I hope to get in, bar accidents, in four days.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 6, _Monday_.—Under way 9.20. Picked up thirty-two mile depot\r\n11 o’clock. Going with a fair wind in the forenoon, which eased\r\nsomewhat after lunch and so caused very heavy work in pulling. It seems\r\nto me we shall have to depot someone if the wind eases at all. Distance\r\nduring day about eight miles.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 7, _Tuesday_.—Under way 9 o’clock. Although we turn out at 5\r\nit seems a long time to get under way. There is double as much work to\r\ndo now with our invalids. This is the calmest day we have had for\r\nweeks. The sun is shining and all land in sight. It is very hard going.\r\nHad a little breeze about 11 o’clock, set sail, but work still very,\r\nvery heavy. Hayward and Skipper going on ahead with sticks, very slow\r\npace, but it will buck them up and do them good. If one could only get\r\nsome fresh food! About 11 o’clock decided to camp and overhaul sledges\r\nand depot all gear except what is actually required. Under way again at\r\n2, but surface being so sticky did not make any difference. After a\r\nconsultation the Skipper decided to stay behind in a tent with three\r\nweeks’ provisions whilst we pushed on with Smith and Hayward. It seems\r\nhard, only about thirty miles away, and yet cannot get any assistance.\r\nOur gear is absolutely rotten, no sleep last night, shivering all night\r\nin wet bags. I wonder what will be the outcome of it all after our\r\nstruggle. Trust in Providence. Distance about three and a half miles.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 8, _Wednesday_.—Under way 9.20. Wished the Skipper good-bye;\r\ntook Smith and Hayward on. Had a fair wind, going pretty good. Hope to\r\narrive in Hut Point in four days. Lunched at No. 2 depot. Distance\r\nabout four and a half miles. Under way as usual after lunch; head wind,\r\ngoing very heavy. Carried on until 6.30. Distance about eight or nine\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 9, _Thursday_.—Had a very bad night, cold intense. Temperature\r\ndown to —29° all night. At 4 a.m. Spencer-Smith called out that he was\r\nfeeling queer. Wild spoke to him. Then at 5.45 Richards suddenly said,\r\n‘I think he has gone.’ Poor Smith, for forty days in pain he had been\r\ndragged on the sledge, but never grumbled or complained. He had a\r\nstrenuous time in his wet bag, and the jolting of the sledge on a very\r\nweak heart was not too good for him. Sometimes when we lifted him on\r\nthe sledge he would nearly faint, but during the whole time he never\r\ncomplained. Wild looked after him from the start. We buried him in his\r\nbag at 9 o’clock at the following position: Ereb. 184°—Obs. Hill 149°.\r\nWe made a cross of bamboos, and built a mound and cairn, with\r\nparticulars. After that got under way with Hayward on sledge. Found\r\ngoing very hard, as we had a northerly wind in our faces, with a\r\ntemperature below 20°. What with frost-bites, etc., we are all\r\nsuffering. Even the dogs seem like giving in; they do not seem to take\r\nany interest in their work. We have been out much too long, and nothing\r\nahead to cheer us up but a cold, cheerless hut. We did about two and a\r\nhalf miles in the forenoon; Hayward toddling ahead every time we had a\r\nspell. During lunch the wind veered to the south with drift, just right\r\nto set sail. We carried on with Hayward on sledge and camped in the\r\ndark about 8 o’clock. Turned in at 10, weary, worn, and sad. Hoping to\r\nreach depot to-morrow.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 10, _Friday_.—Turned out as usual. Beam wind, going pretty\r\nfair, very cold. Came into very soft snow about 3; arrived at Safety\r\nCamp 5 o’clock. Got to edge of Ice Barrier; found passage over in a bay\r\nfull of seals. Dogs got very excited; had a job to keep them away. By\r\nthe glass it looked clear right to Cape Armitage, which is four and a\r\nhalf miles away. Arrived there 8 o’clock, very dark and bad light.\r\nFound open water. Turned to climb slopes against a strong\r\nnorth-easterly breeze with drift. Found a place about a mile away, but\r\nwe were so done up that it took until 11.30 to get gear up. This slope\r\nwas about 150 yds. up, and every three paces we had to stop and get\r\nbreath. Eventually camped and turned in about 2 o’clock. I think this\r\nis the worst day I ever spent. What with the disappointment of not\r\ngetting round the Point, and the long day and the thought of getting\r\nHayward over the slopes, it is not very entertaining for sleep.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 11, _Saturday_.—Up at 7 o’clock; took binoculars and went over\r\nthe slope to look around the Cape. To my surprise found the open water\r\nand pack at the Cape only extended for about a mile. Came down and gave\r\nthe boys the good news. I think it would take another two hard days to\r\nget over the hills, and we are too weak to do much of that, as I am\r\nafraid of another collapsing. Richards and Wild climbed up to look at\r\nthe back of the bay and found the ice secure. Got under way 10.30, went\r\nround the Cape and found ice; very slushy, but continued on. No turning\r\nnow; got into hard ice shortly after, eventually arriving at Hut Point\r\nabout 3 o’clock. It seems strange after our adventures to arrive back\r\nat the old hut. This place has been standing since we built it in 1901,\r\nand has been the starting-point of a few expeditions since. When we\r\nwere coming down the bay I could fancy the _Discovery_ there when Scott\r\narrived from his Farthest South in 1902, the ship decorated rainbow\r\nfashion, and Lieutenant Armitage giving out the news that Captain Scott\r\nhad got to 82° 17´ S. We went wild that day. But now our homecoming is\r\nquite different. Hut half-full of snow through a window being left open\r\nand drift getting in; but we soon got it shipshape and Hayward in. I\r\nhad the fire going and plenty of vegetables on, as there was a fair\r\nsupply of dried vegetables. Then after we had had a feed, Richards and\r\nWild went down the bay and killed a couple of seals. I gave a good menu\r\nof seal meat at night, and we turned in about 11 o’clock, full—too\r\nfull, in fact. As there is no news here of the ship, and we cannot see\r\nher, we surmise she has gone down with all hands. I cannot see there is\r\nany chance of her being afloat or she would be here. I don’t know how\r\nthe Skipper will take it.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 12, _Sunday_.—Heard groans proceeding from the sleeping-bags\r\nall night; all hands suffering from over-eating. Hayward not very well.\r\nTurned out 8 o’clock. Good breakfast—porridge, seal, vegetables, and\r\ncoffee; more like a banquet to us. After breakfast Richards and Wild\r\nkilled a couple of seals whilst I made the hut a bit comfy. Hayward can\r\nhardly move. All of us in a very bad state, but we must keep up\r\nexercise. My ankles and knees badly swollen, gums prominent. Wild, very\r\nblack around joints, and gums very black. Richards about the best off.\r\nAfter digging hut out I prepared food which I think will keep the\r\nscurvy down. The dogs have lost their lassitude and are quite frisky,\r\nexcept Oscar, who is suffering from over-feeding. After a strenuous\r\nday’s work turned in 10 o’clock.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 13, _Monday_.—Turned out 7 o’clock. Carried on much the same\r\nas yesterday, bringing in seal blubber and meat. Preparing for\r\ndeparture to-morrow; hope every one will be all right. Made new dog\r\nharness and prepared sledges. In afternoon cooked sufficient seal meat\r\nfor our journey out and back, and same for dogs. Turned in 10 o’clock,\r\nfeeling much better.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 14, _Tuesday_.—A beautiful day. Under way after lunch. One\r\nwould think, looking at our party, that we were the most ragged lot one\r\ncould meet in a day’s march; all our clothes past mending, our faces as\r\nblack as niggers’—a sort of crowd one would run away from. Going pretty\r\ngood. As soon as we rounded Cape Armitage a dead head wind with a\r\ntemperature of –18° Fahr., so we are not in for a pleasant time.\r\nArrived at Safety Camp 6 o’clock, turned in 8.30, after getting\r\neverything ready.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 15, _Wednesday_.—Under way as usual. Nice calm day. Had a very\r\ncold night, temperature going down to –30° Fahr. Going along at a\r\nrattling good rate; in spite of our swollen limbs we did about fifteen\r\nmiles. Very cold when we camped; temperature –20° Fahr. Turned in 9\r\no’clock.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 16, _Thursday_.—Up before the sun, 4.45 a.m. Had a very cold\r\nnight, not much sleep. Under way early. Going good. Passed Smith’s\r\ngrave 10.45 a.m. and had lunch at depot. Saw Skipper’s camp just after,\r\nand looking through glass found him outside tent, much to the joy of\r\nall hands, as we expected him to be down. Picked him up 4.15 p.m. Broke\r\nthe news of Smith’s death and no ship. I gave him the date of the 17th\r\nto look out for our returning, so he had a surprise. We struck his camp\r\nand went north for about a mile and camped. We gave the Skipper a\r\nbanquet of seal, vegetables, and black currant jam, the feed of his\r\nlife. He seems in a bad way. I hope to get him in in three days, and I\r\nthink fresh food will improve him. We turned in 8 o’clock. Distance\r\ndone during day sixteen miles.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 17, _Friday_.—Up at 5 o’clock. Under way 8 a.m. Skipper\r\nfeeling much better after feeding him up. Lunched a few yards past\r\nSmith’s grave. Had a good afternoon, going fair. Distance about sixteen\r\nmiles. Very cold night, temperature –30° Fahr. What with wet bags and\r\nclothes, rotten.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 18, _Saturday_.—Turned out 5 o’clock. Had rather a cold night.\r\nTemperature –29° Fahr. Surface very good. The Skipper walked for a\r\nlittle way, which did him good. Lunched as usual. Pace good. After\r\nlunch going good. Arrived at Safety Camp 4.10 p.m. To our delight found\r\nthe sea-ice in the same condition and arrived at Hut Point at 7\r\no’clock. Found Hayward still about same. Set to, made a good dinner,\r\nand all hands seem in the best of spirits. Now we have arrived and got\r\nthe party in, it remains to themselves to get better. Plenty of\r\nexercise and fresh food ought to do miracles. We have been out 160\r\ndays, and done a distance of 1561 miles, a good record. I think the\r\nirony of fate was poor Smith going under a day before we got in. I\r\nthink we shall all soon be well. Turned in 10.30 p.m. Before turning in\r\nSkipper shook us by the hand with great emotion, thanking us for saving\r\nhis life.”\r\n\r\nRichards, summarizing the work of the parties, says that the journeys\r\nmade between September 1 and March 18, a period of 160 days, totalled\r\n1561 miles. The main journey, from Hut Point to Mount Hope and return,\r\nwas 830 miles.\r\n\r\n“The equipment,” he adds, “was old at the commencement of the season,\r\nand this told severely at the later stages of the journey. Three Primus\r\nlamps gave out on the journeys, and the old tent brought back by one of\r\nthe last parties showed rents several feet in length. This hampered the\r\ntravelling in the long blizzards. Finneskoe were also in pieces at the\r\nend, and time had frequently to be lost through repairs to clothing\r\nbecoming imperative. This account would not be complete without some\r\nmention of the unselfish service rendered by Wild to his two ill\r\ntent-mates. From the time he remained behind at the long blizzard till\r\nthe death of Spencer-Smith he had two helpless men to attend to, and\r\ndespite his own condition he was ever ready, night or day, to minister\r\nto their wants. This, in a temperature of –30° Fahr. at times, was no\r\nlight task.\r\n\r\n“Without the aid of four faithful friends, Oscar, Con, Gunner, and\r\nTowser, the party could never have arrived back. These dogs from\r\nNovember 5 accompanied the sledging parties, and, although the pace was\r\noften very slow, they adapted themselves well to it. Their endurance\r\nwas fine. For three whole days at one time they had not a scrap of\r\nfood, and this after a period on short rations. Though they were feeble\r\ntowards the end of the trip, their condition usually was good, and\r\nthose who returned with them will ever remember the remarkable service\r\nthey rendered.\r\n\r\n“The first indication of anything wrong with the general health of the\r\nparty occurred at about lat. 82° 30´ S., when Spencer-Smith complained\r\nof stiffness in the legs and discolouration. He attributed this to\r\nholes in his windproof clothing. At lat. 83° S., when he gave way, it\r\nwas thought that the rest would do him good. About the end of January\r\nCaptain Mackintosh showed very serious signs of lameness. At this time\r\nhis party had been absent from Hut Point, and consequently from fresh\r\nfood, about three months.\r\n\r\n“On the journey back Spencer-Smith gradually became weaker, and for\r\nsome time before the end was in a very weak condition indeed. Captain\r\nMackintosh, by great efforts, managed to keep his feet until the long\r\nblizzard was encountered. Here it was that Hayward was first found to\r\nbe affected with the scurvy, his knees being stiff. In his case the\r\ndisease took him off his feet very suddenly, apparently causing the\r\nmuscles of his legs to contract till they could be straightened hardly\r\nmore than a right angle. He had slight touches in the joints of the\r\narms. In the cases of Joyce, Wild, and Richards, joints became stiff\r\nand black in the rear, but general weakness was the worst symptom\r\nexperienced. Captain Mackintosh’s legs looked the worst in the party.”\r\n\r\nThe five men who were now at Hut Point found quickly that some of the\r\nwinter months must be spent there. They had no news of the ship, and\r\nwere justified in assuming that she had not returned to the Sound,\r\nsince if she had some message would have been awaiting them at Hut\r\nPoint, if not farther south. The sea-ice had broken and gone north\r\nwithin a mile of the point, and the party must wait until the new ice\r\nbecame firm as far as Cape Evans. Plenty of seal meat was available, as\r\nwell as dried vegetables, and the fresh food improved the condition of\r\nthe patients very rapidly. Richards massaged the swollen joints and\r\nfound that this treatment helped a good deal. Before the end of March\r\nMackintosh and Hayward, the worst sufferers, were able to take\r\nexercise. By the second week of April Mackintosh was free of pain,\r\nthough the backs of his legs were still discoloured.\r\n\r\nA tally of the stores at the hut showed that on a reasonable allowance\r\nthe supply would last till the middle of June. Richards and Wild killed\r\nmany seals, so that there was no scarcity of meat and blubber. A few\r\npenguins were also secured. The sole means of cooking food and heating\r\nthe hut was an improvised stove of brick, covered with two sheets of\r\niron. This had been used by the former Expedition. The stove emitted\r\ndense smoke and often made the hut very uncomfortable, while at the\r\nsame time it covered the men and all their gear with clinging and\r\npenetrating soot. Cleanliness was out of the question, and this\r\nincreased the desire of the men to get across to Cape Evans. During\r\nApril the sea froze in calm weather, but winds took the ice out again.\r\nOn April 23 Joyce walked four miles to the north, partly on young ice\r\ntwo inches thick, and he thought then that the party might be able to\r\nreach Cape Evans within a few days. But a prolonged blizzard took the\r\nice out right up to the Point, so that the open water extended at the\r\nend of April right up to the foot of Vinie’s Hill. Then came a spell of\r\ncalm weather, and during the first week of May the sea-ice formed\r\nrapidly. The men made several short trips over it to the north. The sun\r\nhad disappeared below the horizon in the middle of April, and would not\r\nappear again for over four months.\r\n\r\nThe disaster that followed is described by both Richards and Joyce.\r\n“And now a most regrettable incident occurred,” wrote Richards. “On the\r\nmorning of May 8, before breakfast, Captain Mackintosh asked Joyce what\r\nhe thought of his going to Cape Evans with Hayward. Captain Mackintosh\r\nconsidered the ice quite safe, and the fine morning no doubt tempted\r\nhim to exchange the quarters at the hut for the greater comfort and\r\nbetter food at Cape Evans.” (Mackintosh naturally would be anxious to\r\nknow if the men at Cape Evans were well and had any news of the ship.)\r\n“He was strongly urged at the time not to take the risk, as it was\r\npointed out that the ice, although firm, was very young, and that a\r\nblizzard was almost sure to take part of it out to sea.”\r\n\r\nHowever, at about 1 p.m., with the weather apparently changing for the\r\nworse, Mackintosh and Hayward left, after promising to turn back if the\r\nweather grew worse. The last sight the watching party on the hill\r\ngained of them was when they were about a mile away, close to the\r\nshore, but apparently making straight for Cape Evans. At 3 p.m. a\r\nmoderate blizzard was raging, which later increased in fury, and the\r\nparty in the hut had many misgivings for the safety of the absent men.\r\n\r\nOn May 10, the first day possible, the three men left behind walked\r\nover new ice to the north to try and discover some trace as to the fate\r\nof the others. The footmarks were seen clearly enough raised up on the\r\nice, and the track was followed for about two miles in a direction\r\nleading to Cape Evans. Here they ended abruptly, and in the dim light a\r\nwide stretch of water, very lightly covered with ice, was seen as far\r\nas the eye could reach. It was at once evident that part of the ice\r\nover which they had travelled had gone out to sea.\r\n\r\nThe whole party had intended, if the weather had held good, to have\r\nattempted the passage across with the full moon about May 16. On the\r\ndate on which Mackintosh and Hayward left it was impossible that a\r\nsledge should travel the distance over the sea-ice owing to the sticky\r\nnature of the surface. Hence their decision to go alone and leave the\r\nothers to follow with the sledge and equipment when the surface should\r\nimprove. That they had actually been lost was learned only on July 15,\r\non which date the party from Hut Point arrived at Cape Evans.\r\n\r\nThe entry in Joyce’s diary shows that he had very strong forebodings of\r\ndisaster when Mackintosh and Hayward left. He warned them not to go, as\r\nthe ice was still thin and the weather was uncertain. Mackintosh seems\r\nto have believed that he and Hayward, travelling light, could get\r\nacross to Cape Evans quickly before the weather broke, and if the\r\nblizzard had come two or three hours later they probably would have\r\nbeen safe. The two men carried no sleeping-bags and only a small meal\r\nof chocolate and seal meat.\r\n\r\nThe weather during June was persistently bad. No move had been possible\r\non May 16, the sea-ice being out, and Joyce decided to wait until the\r\nnext full moon. When this came the weather was boisterous, and so it\r\nwas not until the full moon of July that the journey to Cape Evans was\r\nmade. During June and July seals got very scarce, and the supply of\r\nblubber ran short.\r\n\r\nMeals consisted of little but seal meat and porridge. The small stock\r\nof salt was exhausted, but the men procured two and a half pounds by\r\nboiling down snow taken from the bottom layer next to the sea-ice. The\r\ndogs recovered condition rapidly and did some hunting on their own\r\naccount among the seals.\r\n\r\nThe party started for Cape Evans on July 15. They had expected to take\r\nadvantage of the full moon, but by a strange chance they had chosen the\r\nperiod of an eclipse, and the moon was shadowed most of the time they\r\nwere crossing the sea-ice. The ice was firm, and the three men reached\r\nCape Evans without difficulty. They found Stevens, Cope, Gaze, and Jack\r\nat the Cape Evans Hut, and learned that nothing had been seen of\r\nCaptain Mackintosh and Hayward. The conclusion that these men had\r\nperished was accepted reluctantly. The party at the base consisted now\r\nof Stevens, Cope, Joyce, Richards, Gaze, Wild, and Jack.\r\n\r\nThe men settled down now to wait for relief. When opportunity offered\r\nJoyce led search-parties to look for the bodies or any trace of the\r\nmissing men, and he subsequently handed me the following report:\r\n\r\n“I beg to report that the following steps were taken to try and\r\ndiscover the bodies of Captain Mackintosh and Mr. Hayward. After our\r\nparty’s return to the hut at Cape Evans, July 15, 1916, it was learned\r\nthat Captain Mackintosh and Mr. Hayward had not arrived; and, being\r\naware of the conditions under which they were last seen, all the\r\nmembers of the wintering party were absolutely convinced that these two\r\nmen were totally lost and dead—that they could not have lived for more\r\nthan a few hours at the outside in the blizzard that they had\r\nencountered, they being entirely unprovided with equipment of any sort.\r\n\r\n“There was the barest chance that after the return of the sun some\r\ntrace of their bodies might be found, so during the spring—that is,\r\nAugust and September 1916—and in the summer—December and January\r\n1916–17—the following searches were carried out:\r\n\r\n“(1) Wild and I thoroughly searched Inaccessible Island at the end of\r\nAugust 1916.\r\n\r\n“(2) Various parties in September searched along the shore to the\r\nvicinity of Turk’s Head.\r\n\r\n“(3) In company with Messrs. Wild and Gaze I started from Hut Point,\r\nDecember 31, 1916, at 8 a.m., and a course was steered inshore as close\r\nas possible to the cliffs in order to search for any possible means of\r\nascent. At a distance of half a mile from Hut Point we passed a snow\r\nslope which I had already ascended in June 1916; three and a half miles\r\nfarther on was another snow slope, which ended in Blue Ice Glacier\r\nslope, which we found impossible to climb, snow slope being formed by\r\nheavy winter snowfall. These were the only two places accessible.\r\nDistance on this day, 10 miles 1710 yds covered. On January 1 search\r\nwas continued round the south side of Glacier Tongue from the base\r\ntowards the seaward end. There was much heavy pressure; it was\r\nimpossible to reach the summit owing to the wide crack. Distance\r\ncovered 4 miles 100 yds. On January 2 thick weather caused party to lay\r\nup. On 3rd, glacier was further examined, and several slopes formed by\r\nsnow led to top of glacier, but crevasses between slope and the tongue\r\nprevented crossing. The party then proceeded round the Tongue to Tent\r\nIsland, which was also searched, a complete tour of the island being\r\nmade. It was decided to make for Cape Evans, as thick weather was\r\napproaching. We arrived at 8 p.m. Distance 8 miles 490 yds.\r\n\r\n“I remain, etc.,\r\n“ERNEST E. JOYCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n“_To_ Sir ERNEST SHACKLETON, C.V.O.,\r\n“_Commander_, I.T.A.E.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn September Richards was forced to lay up at the hut owing to a\r\nstrained heart, due presumably to stress of work on the sledging\r\njourneys. Early in October a party consisting of Joyce, Gaze, and Wild\r\nspent several days at Cape Royds, where they skinned specimens. They\r\nsledged stores back to Cape Evans in case it should be found necessary\r\nto remain there over another winter. In September, Joyce, Gaze, and\r\nWild went out to Spencer-Smith’s grave with a wooden cross, which they\r\nerected firmly. Relief arrived on January 10, 1917, but it is necessary\r\nnow to turn back to the events of May 1915, when the _Aurora_ was\r\ndriven from her moorings off Cape Evans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\nTHE _AURORA’S_ DRIFT\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Mackintosh left the _Aurora_ on January 25, 1915, Stenhouse kept\r\nthe ship with difficulty off Tent Island. The ice-anchors would not\r\nhold, owing to the continual breaking away of the pack, and he found it\r\nnecessary much of the time to steam slow ahead against the floes. The\r\nthird sledging party, under Cope, left the ship on the afternoon of the\r\n31st, with the motor-tractor towing two sledges, and disappeared\r\ntowards Hut Point. Cope’s party returned to the ship on February 2 and\r\nleft again on February 5, after a delay caused by the loose condition\r\nof the ice. Two days later, after more trouble with drifting floes,\r\nStenhouse proceeded to Cape Evans, where he took a line of soundings\r\nfor the winter quarters. During the next month the _Aurora_ occupied\r\nvarious positions in the neighbourhood of Cape Evans. No secure\r\nmoorings were available. The ship had to keep clear of threatening\r\nfloes, dodge “growlers” and drifting bergs, and find shelter from the\r\nblizzards. A sudden shift of wind on February 24, when the ship was\r\nsheltering in the lee of Glacier Tongue, caused her to be jammed hard\r\nagainst the low ice off the glacier, but no damage was done. Early in\r\nMarch Stenhouse sent moorings ashore at Cape Evans, and on March 11 he\r\nproceeded to Hut Point, where he dropped anchor in Discovery Bay. Here\r\nhe landed stores, amounting to about two months’ full rations for\r\ntwelve men, and embarked Spencer-Smith, Stevens, Hook, Richards,\r\nNinnis, and Gaze, with two dogs. He returned to Cape Evans that\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n“We had a bad time when we were ‘sculling’ about the Sound, first\r\nendeavouring to make Hut Point to land provisions, and then looking for\r\nwinter quarters in the neighbourhood of Glacier Tongue,” wrote\r\nStenhouse afterwards. “The ice kept breaking away in small floes, and\r\nwe were apparently no nearer to anywhere than when the sledges left; we\r\nwere frustrated in every move. The ship broke away from the fast ice in\r\nblizzards, and then we went dodging about the Sound from the Ross\r\nIsland side to the western pack, avoiding and clearing floes and\r\ngrowlers in heavy drift when we could see nothing, our compasses\r\nunreliable and the ship short-handed. In that homeless time I kept\r\nwatch and watch with the second officer, and was hard pressed to know\r\nwhat to do. Was ever ship in such predicament? To the northward of Cape\r\nRoyds was taboo, as also was the coast south of Glacier Tongue. In a\r\nsmall stretch of ice-bound coast we had to find winter quarters. The\r\nice lingered on, and all this time we could find nowhere to drop\r\nanchor, but had to keep steam handy for emergencies. Once I tried the\r\nNorth Bay of Cape Evans, as it apparently was the only ice-free spot. I\r\ncalled all hands, and making up a boat’s crew with one of the firemen\r\nsent the whaler away with the second officer in charge to sound. No\r\nsooner had the boat left ship than the wind freshened from the\r\nnorthward, and large bergs and growlers, setting into the bay, made the\r\nplace untenable. The anchorage I eventually selected seemed the best\r\navailable—and here we are drifting, with all plans upset, when we ought\r\nto be lying in winter quarters.”\r\n\r\nA heavy gale came up on March 12, and the _Aurora_, then moored off\r\nCape Evans, dragged her anchor and drifted out of the bay. She went\r\nnorthward past Cape Barne and Cape Royds in a driving mist, with a\r\nheavy storm-sea running. This gale was a particularly heavy one. The\r\nship and gear were covered with ice, owing to the freezing of spray,\r\nand Stenhouse had anxious hours amid the heavy, ice-encumbered waters\r\nbefore the gale moderated. The young ice, which was continually forming\r\nin the very low temperature, helped to reduce the sea as soon as the\r\ngale moderated, and the _Aurora_ got back to Cape Evans on the evening\r\nof the 13th. Ice was forming in the bay, and on the morning of the 14th\r\nStenhouse took the ship into position for winter moorings. He got three\r\nsteel hawsers out and made fast to the shore anchors. These hawsers\r\nwere hove tight, and the _Aurora_ rested then, with her stern to the\r\nshore, in seven fathoms. Two more wires were taken ashore the next day.\r\nYoung ice was forming around the ship, and under the influence of wind\r\nand tide this ice began early to put severe strains upon the moorings.\r\nStenhouse had the fires drawn and the boiler blown down on the 20th,\r\nand the engineer reported at that time that the bunkers contained still\r\n118 tons of coal.\r\n\r\nThe ice broke away between Cape Evans and Cape Barne on the 23rd, and\r\npressure around the ship shattered the bay ice and placed heavy strains\r\non the stern moorings. The young ice, about four inches thick, went out\r\neventually and left a lead along the shore. The ship had set in towards\r\nthe shore, owing to the pressure, and the stern was now in\r\nfour-and-a-half fathoms. Stenhouse tightened the moorings and ran out\r\nan extra wire to the shore anchor. The nature of the ice movements is\r\nillustrated by a few extracts from the log:\r\n\r\n“_March_ 27, 5 p.m.—Ice broke away from shore and started to go out. 8\r\np.m.—Light southerly airs; fine; ice setting out to north-west; heavy\r\npressure of ice on starboard side and great strain on moorings. 10\r\np.m.—Ice clear of ship.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 28.—New ice forming over bay. 3 a.m.—Ice which went out last\r\nwatch set in towards bay. 5 a.m.—Ice coming in and overriding newly\r\nformed bay-ice; heavy pressure on port side of ship; wires frozen into\r\nice. 8 a.m.—Calm and fine; new ice setting out of bay. 5 p.m.—New ice\r\nformed since morning cleared from bay except area on port side of ship\r\nand stretching abeam and ahead for about 200 yds., which is held by\r\nbights of wire; new ice forming.\r\n\r\n“_March_ 29, 1.30 p.m.—New ice going out. 2 p.m.—Hands on floe on port\r\nquarter clearing wires; stern in three fathoms; hauled wires tight,\r\nbringing stern more to eastward and in four fathoms; hove in about one\r\nfathom of starboard cable, which had dragged during recent pressure.\r\n\r\n“_April_ 10, 1.30 p.m.—Ice breaking from shore under influence of\r\nsouth-east wind. Two starboard quarter wires parted; all bights of\r\nstern wires frozen in ice; chain taking weight. 2 p.m.—Ice opened,\r\nleaving ice in bay in line from Cape to landward of glacier. 8\r\np.m.—Fresh wind; ship holding ice in bay; ice in Sound wind-driven to\r\nnorth-west.\r\n\r\n“_April_ 17, 1 am.—Pressure increased and wind shifted to north-west.\r\nIce continued to override and press into shore until 5 o’clock; during\r\nthis time pressure into bay was very heavy; movement of ice in straits\r\ncausing noise like heavy surf. Ship took ground gently at rudder-post\r\nduring pressure; bottom under stern shallows very quickly. 10\r\np.m.—Ice-moving out of bay to westward; heavy strain on after moorings\r\nand cables, which are cutting the floe.”\r\n\r\nStenhouse continued to nurse his moorings against the onslaughts of the\r\nice during the rest of April and the early days of May. The break-away\r\nfrom the shore came suddenly and unexpectedly on the evening of May 6:\r\n\r\n“_May_ 6, 1915.—Fine morning with light breezes from\r\neast-south-east.... 3.30 p.m.—Ice nearly finished. Sent hands ashore\r\nfor sledge-load. 4 p.m.—Wind freshening with blizzardy appearance of\r\nsky. 8 p.m.—. . . Heavy strain on after-moorings. 9.45 p.m.—The ice\r\nparted from the shore; all moorings parted. Most fascinating to listen\r\nto waves and chain breaking. In the thick haze I saw the ice astern\r\nbreaking up and the shore receding. I called all hands and clapped\r\nrelieving tackles (4-in. Manila luff tackles) on to the cables on the\r\nforepart of the windlass. The bos’n had rushed along with his hurricane\r\nlamp, and shouted, ‘She’s away wi’ it!’ He is a good fellow and very\r\nconscientious. I ordered steam on main engines, and the engine-room\r\nstaff, with Hooke and Ninnis, turned to. Grady, fireman, was laid up\r\nwith a broken rib. As the ship, in the solid floe, set to the\r\nnorth-west, the cables rattled and tore at the hawse-pipes; luckily the\r\nanchors, lying as they were on a strip-sloping bottom, came away\r\neasily, without damage to windlass or hawse-pipes. Slowly as we\r\ndisappeared into Sound, the light in the hut died away. At 11.30 p.m.\r\nthe ice around us started to break up, the floes playing tattoo on the\r\nship’s sides. We were out in the Sound and catching the full force of\r\nthe wind. The moon broke through the clouds after midnight and showed\r\nus the pack, stretching continuously to northward, and about one mile\r\nto the south. As the pack from the southward came up and closed in on\r\nthe ship, the swell lessened and the banging of floes alongside eased a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n“_May_ 7, 8 a.m.—Wind east-south-east. Moderate gale with thick drift.\r\nThe ice around ship is packing up and forming ridges about two feet\r\nhigh. The ship is lying with head to the eastward, Cape Bird showing to\r\nnorth-east. When steam is raised I have hopes of getting back to the\r\nfast ice near the Glacier Tongue. Since we have been in winter quarters\r\nthe ice has formed and, held by the islands and land at Cape Evans, has\r\nremained north of the Tongue. If we can return we should be able now to\r\nmoor to the fast ice. The engineers are having great difficulty with\r\nthe sea connexions, which are frozen. The main bow-down cock, from\r\nwhich the boiler is ‘run up,’ has been tapped and a screw plug put into\r\nit to allow of a hot iron rod being inserted to thaw out the ice\r\nbetween the cock and the ship’s side—about two feet of hard ice. 4.30\r\np.m.—The hot iron has been successful. Donolly (second engineer) had\r\nthe pleasure of stopping the first spurt of water through the pipe; he\r\ngot it in the eye. Fires were lit in furnaces, and water commenced to\r\nblow in the boiler—the first blow in our defence against the terrific\r\nforces of Nature in the Antarctic. 8 p.m.—The gale has freshened,\r\naccompanied by thick drift.”\r\n\r\nThe _Aurora_ drifted helplessly throughout May 7. On the morning of May\r\n8 the weather cleared a little and the Western Mountains became\r\nindistinctly visible. Cape Bird could also be seen. The ship was moving\r\nnorthwards with the ice. The daylight was no more than a short twilight\r\nof about two hours’ duration. The boiler was being filled with ice,\r\nwhich had to be lifted aboard, broken up, passed through a small\r\nporthole to a man inside, and then carried to the manhole on top of the\r\nboiler. Stenhouse had the wireless aerial rigged during the afternoon,\r\nand at 5 p.m. was informed that the watering of the boiler was\r\ncomplete. The wind freshened to a moderate southerly gale, with thick\r\ndrift, in the night, and this gale continued during the following day,\r\nthe 9th. The engineer reported at noon that he had 40-lb. pressure in\r\nthe boiler and was commencing the thawing of the auxiliary\r\nsea-connexion pump by means of a steam-pipe.\r\n\r\n“Cape Bird is the only land visible, bearing north-east true about\r\neight miles distant,” wrote, Stenhouse on the afternoon of the 9th. “So\r\nthis is the end of our attempt to winter in McMurdo Sound. Hard luck\r\nafter four months’ buffeting, for the last seven weeks of which we\r\nnursed our moorings. Our present situation calls for increasing\r\nvigilance. It is five weeks to the middle of winter. There is no sun,\r\nthe light is little and uncertain, and we may expect many blizzards. We\r\nhave no immediate water-supply, as only a small quantity of fresh ice\r\nwas aboard when we broke drift.\r\n\r\n“The _Aurora_ is fast in the pack and drifting God knows where. Well,\r\nthere are prospects of a most interesting winter drift. We are all in\r\ngood health, except Grady, whose rib is mending rapidly; we have good\r\nspirits and we will get through. But what of the poor beggars at Cape\r\nEvans, and the Southern Party? It is a dismal prospect for them. There\r\nare sufficient provisions at Cape Evans, Hut Point, and, I suppose,\r\nCape Royds, but we have the remaining Burberrys, clothing, etc., for\r\nnext year’s sledging still on board. I see little prospect of getting\r\nback to Cape Evans or anywhere in the Sound. We are short of coal and\r\nheld firmly in the ice. I hope she drifts quickly to the north-east.\r\nThen we can endeavour to push through the pack and make for New\r\nZealand, coal and return to the Barrier eastward of Cape Crozier. This\r\ncould be done, I think, in the early spring, September. We must get\r\nback to aid the depot-laying next season.”\r\n\r\nA violent blizzard raged on May 10 and 11. “I never remember such\r\nwind-force,” said Stenhouse. “It was difficult to get along the deck.”\r\nThe weather moderated on the 12th, and a survey of the ship’s position\r\nwas possible. “We are lying in a field of ice with our anchors and\r\nseventy-five fathoms of cable on each hanging at the bows. The\r\nafter-moorings were frozen into the ice astern of us at Cape Evans.\r\nPrevious to the date of our leaving our winter berth four small wires\r\nhad parted. When we broke away the chain two of the heavy (4-in.) wires\r\nparted close to shore; the other wire went at the butts. The chain and\r\ntwo wires are still fast in the ice and will have to be dug out. This\r\nmorning we cleared the ice around the cables, but had to abandon the\r\nheaving-in, as the steam-froze in the return pipes from the windlass\r\nexhaust, and the joints had to be broken and the pipe thawed out. Hooke\r\nwas ‘listening in’ from 8.30 p.m. to 12.30 a.m. for the Macquarie\r\nIsland wireless station (1340 miles away) or the Bluff (New Zealand)\r\nstation (1860 miles away), but had no luck.”\r\n\r\nThe anchors were hove in by dint of much effort on the 13th and 14th,\r\nice forming on the cable as it was hoisted through a hole cut in the\r\nfloe. Both anchors had broken, so the _Aurora_ had now one small\r\nkedge-anchor left aboard. The ship’s position on May 14 was\r\napproximately forty-five miles north, thirty-four west of Cape Evans.\r\n“In one week we have drifted forty-five miles (geographical). Most of\r\nthis distance was covered during the first two days of the drift. We\r\nappear to be nearly stationary. What movement there is in the ice seems\r\nto be to the north-west towards the ice-bound coast. Hands who were\r\nafter penguins yesterday reported much noise in the ice about one mile\r\nfrom the ship. I hope the floe around the ship is large enough to take\r\nits own pressure. We cannot expect much pressure from the south, as\r\nMcMurdo Sound should soon be frozen over and the ice holding.\r\nNorth-east winds would drive the pack in from the Ross Sea. I hope for\r\nthe best. Plans for future development are ready, but probably will be\r\ncheckmated again.... I took the anchors aboard. They are of no further\r\nuse as separate anchors, but they ornament the forecastle head, so we\r\nput them in their places.... The supply of fresh water is a problem.\r\nThe engineer turned steam from the boiler into the main water-tank\r\n(starboard) through a pipe leading from the main winch-pipe to the tank\r\ntop. The steam condenses before reaching the tank. I hope freezing does\r\nnot burst the tank. A large tabular iceberg, calved from the Barrier,\r\nis silhouetted against the twilight glow in the sky about ten miles\r\naway. The sight of millions of tons of fresh ice is most tantalizing.\r\nIt would be a week’s journey to the berg and back over pack and\r\npressure, and probably we could bring enough ice to last two days.”\r\n\r\nThe record of the early months of the _Aurora’s_ long drift in the Ross\r\nSea is not eventful. The galley condenser was rigged, but the supply of\r\nfresh water remained a problem. The men collected fresh-fallen snow\r\nwhen possible and hoped to get within reach of fresh ice. Hooke and\r\nNinnis worked hard at the wireless plant with the object of getting\r\ninto touch with Macquarie Island, and possibly sending news of the\r\nship’s movements to Cape Evans. They got the wireless motor running and\r\nmade many adjustments of the instruments and aerials, but their efforts\r\nwere not successful. Emperor penguins approached the ship occasionally,\r\nand the birds were captured whenever possible for the fresh meat they\r\nafforded. The _Aurora_ was quite helpless in the grip of the ice, and\r\nafter the engine-room bilges had been thawed and pumped out the boilers\r\nwere blown down. The pressure had been raised to sixty pounds, but\r\nthere was no chance of moving the ship, and the supply of coal was\r\nlimited. The story of the _Aurora’s_ drift during long months can be\r\ntold briefly by means of extracts from Stenhouse’s log:\r\n\r\n“_May_ 21.—Early this morning there appeared to be movements in the\r\nice. The grating and grinding noise makes one feel the unimportance of\r\nman in circumstances like ours. Twilight towards noon showed several\r\nnarrow, open leads about two cables from ship and in all directions.\r\nUnable to get bearing, but imagine that there is little or no\r\nalteration in ship’s position, as ship’s head is same, and Western\r\nMountains appear the same.... Hope all is well at Cape Evans and that\r\nthe other parties have returned safely. Wish we could relieve their\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\n“_May_ 22.—Obtained good bearings of Beaufort Island, Cape Ross, and\r\nDunlop Island, which put the ship in a position eighteen miles south\r\n75° east (true) from Cape Ross. Since the 14th, when reliable bearings\r\nwere last obtained, we have drifted north-west by north seven miles.\r\n\r\n“_May_ 24.—Blizzard from south-south-east continued until 9 p.m., when\r\nit moderated, and at 11.45 p.m. wind shifted to north-west, light, with\r\nsnow. Quite a lot of havoc has been caused during this blow, and the\r\nship has made much northing. In the morning the crack south of the ship\r\nopened to about three feet. At 2 p.m. felt heavy shock and the ship\r\nheeled to port about 70°. Found ice had cracked from port gangway to\r\nnorth-west, and parted from ship from gangway along to stern. Crack\r\nextended from stern to south-east. 7.35 p.m.—Ice cracked from port fore\r\nchains, in line parallel to previous crack. The ice broke again between\r\nthe cracks and drifted to north-west for about ten yards. The ice to\r\nsouthward then commenced to break up, causing heavy strain on ship, and\r\nsetting apparently north in large broken fields. Ship badly jammed in.\r\n9.15 p.m.—Ice closed in again around ship. Two heavy windsqualls with a\r\nshort interval between followed by cessation of wind. We are in a\r\nlabyrinth of large rectangular floes (some with their points pressing\r\nheavily against ship) and high pressure-ridges.\r\n\r\n“_May_ 25.—In middle watch felt pressure occasionally. Twilight showed\r\na scene of chaos all around; one floe about three feet in thickness had\r\nupended, driven under ship on port quarter. As far as can be seen there\r\nare heavy blocks of ice screwed up on end, and the scene is like a\r\ngraveyard. I think swell must have come up under ice from seaward\r\n(north-east), McMurdo Sound, and broken the ice, which afterwards\r\nstarted to move under the influence of the blizzard. Hardly think swell\r\ncame from the Sound, as the cracks were wending from north-west to\r\nsouth-east, and also as the Sound should be getting icebound by now. If\r\nswell came from north-east then there is open water not far away. I\r\nshould like to know. I believe the Ross Sea is rarely entirely\r\nice-covered. Have bright moonlight now, which accentuates\r\neverything—the beauty and loneliness of our surroundings, and\r\nuselessness of ourselves, while in this prison: so near to Cape Evans\r\nand yet we might as well be anywhere as here. Have made our\r\nsledging-ration scales, and crew are busy making harness and getting\r\nsledging equipment ready for emergencies. Temperature –30° Fahr.\r\n\r\n“_May_ 26.—If the ship is nipped in the ice, the ship’s company\r\n(eighteen hands) will take to four sledges with one month’s rations and\r\nmake for nearest land. Six men and one sledge will endeavour to make\r\nCape Evans via the western land, Butler Point, Hut Point, etc. The\r\nremaining twelve will come along with all possible speed, but no forced\r\nmarches, killing and depot-ing penguins and seals for emergency\r\nretreats. If the ship remains here and makes no further drift to the\r\nnorth, towards latter end of July light will be making. The sun returns\r\nAugust 23. The sea-ice should be fairly safe, and a party of three,\r\nwith one month’s rations, will proceed to Cape Evans. If the ice sets\r\nnorth and takes the ship clear of land, we will proceed to New Zealand,\r\nbunker, get extra officer and four volunteers, provisions, etc., push\r\nsouth with all speed to the Barrier, put party on to the Barrier, about\r\ntwo miles east of Cape Crozier, and land all necessary stores and\r\nrequirements. The ship will stand off until able to reach Cape Evans.\r\nIf necessary, party will depot all stores possible at Corner Camp and\r\ngo on to Cape Evans. If worst has happened my party will lay out the\r\ndepot at the Beardmore for Shackleton. If the ship is released from the\r\nice after September we must endeavour to reach Cape Evans before going\r\nnorth to bunker. We have not enough coal to hang about the Sound for\r\nmany days.\r\n\r\n“_May_ 28.—By the position obtained by meridian altitude of stars and\r\nbearing of Mount Melbourne, we have drifted thirty-six miles north-east\r\nfrom last bearings taken on 23rd inst. The most of this must have been\r\nduring the blizzard of the 24th. Mount Melbourne is one hundred and\r\neleven miles due north of us, and there is some doubt in my mind as to\r\nwhether the peak which we can see is this mountain. There may be a\r\nmirage.... In the evening had the football out on the ice by the light\r\nof a beautiful moon. The exercise and break from routine are a splendid\r\ntonic. Ice-noises sent all hands on board.\r\n\r\n“_June_ 1.—Thick, hazy weather. In the afternoon a black streak\r\nappeared in the ice about a cable’s length to the westward and\r\nstretching north and south. 8 p.m.—The black line widened and showed\r\nlong lane of open water. Apparently we are fast in a floe which has\r\nbroken from the main field. With thick weather we are uncertain of our\r\nposition and drift. It will be interesting to find out what this crack\r\nin the ice signifies. I am convinced that there is open water, not far\r\ndistant, in the Ross Sea.... To-night Hooke is trying to call up Cape\r\nEvans. If the people at the hut have rigged the set which was left\r\nthere, they will hear ‘All well’ from the _Aurora_. I hope they have.\r\n[The messages were not received.]\r\n\r\n“_June_ 8.—Made our latitude 75° 59´ S. by altitude of Sirius. This is\r\na very monotonous life, but all hands appear to be happy and contented.\r\nFind that we are not too well off for meals and will have to cut\r\nrations a little. Grady is taking exercise now and should soon be well\r\nagain. He seems very anxious to get to work again, and is a good man.\r\nNo wireless calls to-night, as there is a temporary breakdown—condenser\r\njar broken. There is a very faint display of aurora in northern sky. It\r\ncomes and goes almost imperceptibly, a most fascinating sight. The\r\ntemperature is –20° Fahr.; 52° of frost is much too cold to allow one\r\nto stand for long.\r\n\r\n“_June_ 11.—Walked over to a very high pressure-ridge about a quarter\r\nof a mile north-north-west of the ship. In the dim light walking over\r\nthe ice is far from being monotonous, as it is almost impossible to see\r\nobstacles, such as small, snowed-up ridges, which makes us wary and\r\ncautious. A dip in the sea would be the grand finale, but there is\r\nlittle risk of this as the water freezes as soon as a lane opens in the\r\nice. The pressure-ridge is about fifteen to twenty feet high for\r\nseveral hundred feet, and the ice all about it is bent up in a most\r\nextraordinary manner. At 9 p.m. Hooke called Cape Evans, ‘All\r\nwell—_Aurora_,’ etc.; 10 p.m., weather reports for 8 p.m. sent to\r\nWellington, New Zealand, and Melbourne, via Macquarie Island. [The\r\ndispatch of messages from the _Aurora_ was continued, but it was\r\nlearned afterwards that none of them had been received by any station.]\r\n\r\n“_June_ 13.—The temperature in the chart-room ranges from zero to a\r\nlittle above freezing-point. This is a very disturbing factor in rates\r\nof the chronometers (five in number, 3 G.M.T. and 2 Sid.T.), which are\r\nkept in cases in a padded box, each case covered by a piece of blanket,\r\nand the box covered by a heavy coat. In any enclosed place where people\r\npass their time, the niches and places where no heat penetrates are\r\ncovered with frozen breath. There will be a big thaw-out when the\r\ntemperature rises.\r\n\r\n“_June_ 14.—Mount Melbourne is bearing north 14° W (true). Our\r\napproximate position is forty miles east-north-east of Nordenskjold Ice\r\nTongue. At 9 p.m. Hooke called Cape Evans and sent weather reports to\r\nWellington and Melbourne via Macquarie Island. Hooke and Ninnis on\r\nseveral evenings at about 11 o’clock have heard what happened to be\r\nfaint messages, but unreadable. He sent word to Macquarie Island of\r\nthis in hopes that they would hear and increase the power.\r\n\r\n“_June_ 20.—During this last blow with its accompanying drift-snow\r\nthere has been much leakage of current from the aerial during the\r\nsending of reports. This is apparently due to induction caused by the\r\nsnow accumulating on the insulators aloft, and thus rendering them\r\nuseless, and probably to increased inductive force of the current in a\r\nbody of snowdrift. Hooke appears to be somewhat downhearted over it,\r\nand, after discussing the matter, gave me a written report on the\r\nnon-success (up to the present time) of his endeavours to establish\r\ncommunication. He thinks that the proximity of the Magnetic Pole and\r\nAurora Australis might affect things. The radiation is good and\r\nsufficient for normal conditions. His suggestion to lead the down lead\r\nwires out to the ahead and astern would increase scope, but I cannot\r\ncountenance it owing to unsettled state of ice and our too lofty poles.\r\n\r\n“_June_ 21.—Blowing gale from south-west throughout day, but for short\r\nspell of westerly breeze about 5 p.m. Light drift at frequent\r\nintervals, very hazy, and consequently no land in sight during short\r\ntwilight. Very hard up for mitts and clothing. What little we have on\r\nboard I have put to one side for the people at the hut. Have given\r\nThompson instructions to turn crew to making pair mitts and helmet out\r\nof Jaeger fleece for all hands forward. With strict economy we should\r\nmake things spin out; cannot help worrying over our people at the hut.\r\nAlthough worrying does no good, one cannot do otherwise in this present\r\nimpotent state. 11 p.m.—Wind howling and whistling through rigging.\r\nOutside, in glare of moon, flying drift and expanse of ice-field.\r\nDesolation!\r\n\r\n“_June_ 22.—To-day the sun has reached the limit of his northern\r\ndeclination and now he will start to come south. Observed this day as\r\nholiday, and in the evening had hands aft to drink to the health of the\r\nKing and the Expedition. All hands are happy, but miss the others at\r\nCape Evans. I pray to God we may soon be clear of this prison and in a\r\nposition to help them. We can live now for sunlight and activity.\r\n\r\n“_July_ 1.—The 1st of July! Thank God. The days pass quickly. Through\r\nall my waking hours one long thought of the people at Cape Evans, but\r\none must appear to be happy and take interest in the small happenings\r\nof shipboard.\r\n\r\n“_July_ 3.—Rather hazy with very little light. Moderate west-north-west\r\nto south-west winds until noon, when wind veered to south and\r\nfreshened. No apparent change in ship’s position; the berg is on the\r\nsame bearing (1 point on the port quarter) and apparently the same\r\ndistance off. Mount Melbourne was hidden behind a bank of clouds. This\r\nis our only landmark now, as Franklin Island is towered in perpetual\r\ngloom. Although we have had the berg in sight during all the time of\r\nour drift from the entrance to McMurdo Sound, we have not yet seen it\r\nin a favourable light, and, were it not for its movement, we might\r\nmistake it for a tabular island. It will be interesting to view our\r\ncompanion in the returning light—unless we are too close to it!\r\n\r\n“_July_ 5.—Dull grey day (during twilight) with light, variable,\r\nwesterly breezes. All around hangs a heavy curtain of haze, and,\r\nalthough very light snow is falling, overhead is black and clear with\r\nstars shining. As soon as the faint noon light fades away the heavy low\r\nhaze intensifies the darkness and makes one thankful that one has a\r\ngood firm ‘berth’ in the ice. I don’t care to contemplate the scene if\r\nthe ice should break up at the present time.\r\n\r\n“_July_ 6.—Last night I thought I saw open water in the shape of a long\r\nblack lane to the southward of the ship and extending in an easterly\r\nand westerly direction, but owing to the haze and light snow I could\r\nnot be sure; this morning the lane was distinctly visible and appeared\r\nto be two or three hundred yards wide and two miles long.... At 6 p.m.\r\nloud pressure-noises would be heard from the direction of the open lane\r\nand continued throughout the night. Shortly after 8 o’clock the\r\ngrinding and hissing spread to our starboard bow (west-south-west), and\r\nthe vibration caused by the pressure could be felt intermittently on\r\nboard the ship.... The incessant grinding and grating of the ice to the\r\nsouthward, with seething noises, as of water rushing under the ship’s\r\nbottom, and ominous sounds, kept me on the _qui vive_ all night, and\r\nthe prospect of a break-up of the ice would have wracked my nerves had\r\nI not had them numbed by previous experiences.\r\n\r\n“_July_ 9.—At noon the sky to the northward had cleared sufficiently to\r\nallow of seeing Mount Melbourne, which appears now as a low peak to the\r\nnorth-west. Ship’s position is twenty-eight miles north-north-east of\r\nFranklin Island. On the port bow and ahead of the ship there are some\r\nenormous pressure-ridges; they seem to be the results of the recent and\r\npresent ice-movements. Pressure heard from the southward all day.\r\n\r\n“_July_ 13.—At 5 p.m. very heavy pressure was heard on the port beam\r\nand bow (south) and very close to the ship. This occurred again at\r\nirregular intervals. Quite close to the ship the ice could be seen\r\nbending upwards, and occasional jars were felt on board. I am inclined\r\nto think that we have set into a cul-de-sac and that we will now\r\nexperience the full force of pressure from the south. We have prepared\r\nfor the worst and can only hope for the best—a release from the ice\r\nwith a seaworthy vessel under us.\r\n\r\n“_July_ 18.—This has been a day of events. About 8 a.m. the horizon to\r\nthe north became clear and, as the light grew, the more westerly land\r\nshowed up. This is the first clear day that we have had since the 9th\r\nof the month, and we have set a considerable distance to the north-east\r\nin the meantime. By meridian altitudes of stars and bearings of the\r\nland, which proved to be Coulman Islands, Mount Murchison, and Mount\r\nMelbourne, our position shows seventy-eight miles (geographical)\r\nnorth-east by north of Franklin Island. During the last three days we\r\nhave drifted forty miles (geographical), so there has been ample reason\r\nfor all the grinding and growling of pressure lately. The ship endured\r\nsome severe squeezes this day.\r\n\r\n“_July_ 20.—Shortly before breakfast the raucous voice of the emperor\r\npenguin was heard, and afterwards two were seen some distance from the\r\nship.... The nearest mainland (in vicinity of Cape Washington) is\r\nninety miles distant, as also is Coulman Island. Franklin Island is\r\neighty miles south-east by south, and the pack is in motion. This is\r\nthe emperor’s hatching season, and here we meet them out in the\r\ncheerless desert of ice.... 10.45 p.m.—Heavy pressure around ship,\r\nlanes opened and ship worked astern about twenty feet. The wires in the\r\nice took the strain (lashings at mizzen chains carried away) and\r\ncarried away fair-lead bollard on port side of forecastle head.\r\n\r\n“_July_ 21, 1 a.m.—Lanes opened to about 40 ft. wide. Ship in open pool\r\nabout 100 ft. wide. Heavy pressure in vicinity of ship. Called all\r\nhands and cut wires at the forecastle head. [These wires had remained\r\nfrozen in the ice after the ship broke away from her moorings, and they\r\nhad served a useful purpose at some times by checking ice-movements\r\nclose to the ship.] 2 a.m.—Ship swung athwart lane as the ice opened,\r\nand the floes on the port side pressed her stern round. 11.30 a.m.—Pack\r\nof killer whales came up in the lane around the ship. Some broke soft\r\nice (about one inch thick) and pushed their heads through, rising to\r\nfive or six feet perpendicularly out of the water. They were apparently\r\nhaving a look round. It is strange to see killers in this immense field\r\nof ice; open water must be near, I think. 5.15 p.m.—New ice of lanes\r\ncracked and opened. Floes on port side pushed stern on to ice (of\r\nfloe); floes then closed in and nipped the ship fore and aft. The\r\nrudder was bent over to starboard and smashed. The solid oak and iron\r\nwent like matchwood. 8 p.m.—Moderate south-south-west gale with drift.\r\nMuch straining of timbers with pressure. 10 p.m.—Extra hard nip fore\r\nand aft; ship visibly hogged. Heavy pressure.\r\n\r\n“_July_ 22.—Ship in bad position in newly frozen lane, with bow and\r\nstern jammed against heavy floes; heavy strain with much creaking and\r\ngroaning. 8 a.m.—Called all hands to stations for sledges, and made\r\nfinal preparations for abandoning ship. Allotted special duties to\r\nseveral hands to facilitate quickness in getting clear should ship be\r\ncrushed. Am afraid the ship’s back will be broken if the pressure\r\ncontinues, but cannot relieve her. 2 p.m.—Ship lying easier. Poured\r\nSulphuric acid on the ice astern in hopes of rotting crack and\r\nrelieving pressure on stern-post, but unsuccessfully. Very heavy\r\npressure on and around ship (taking strain fore and aft and on\r\nstarboard quarter). Ship, jumping and straining and listing badly. 10\r\np.m.—Ship has crushed her way into new ice on starboard side and slewed\r\naslant lane with stern-post clear of land-ice. 12 p.m.—Ship is in safer\r\nposition; lanes opening in every direction.\r\n\r\n“_July_ 23.—Caught glimpse of Coulman Island through haze. Position of\r\nship south 14° east (true), eighty miles off Coulman Island. Pressure\r\ncontinued intermittently throughout the day and night, with occasional\r\nvery heavy squeezes to the ship which made timbers crack and groan. The\r\nship’s stern is now in a more or less soft bed, formed of recently\r\nfrozen ice of about one foot in thickness. I thank God that we have\r\nbeen spared through this fearful nightmare. I shall never forget the\r\nconcertina motions of the ship during yesterday’s and Wednesday’s fore\r\nand aft nips.\r\n\r\n“_July_ 24.—Compared with previous days this is a quiet one. The lanes\r\nhave been opening and closing, and occasionally the ship gets a nasty\r\nsqueeze against the solid floe on our starboard quarter. The more lanes\r\nthat open the better, as they form ‘springs’ (when covered with thin\r\nice, which makes to a thickness of three or four inches in a few hours)\r\nbetween the solid and heavier floes and fields. Surely we have been\r\nguided by the hands of Providence to have come in heavy grinding pack\r\nfor over two hundred miles (geographical), skirting the ice-bound\r\nwestern shore, around and to the north of Franklin Island, and now into\r\nwhat appears a clear path to the open sea! In view of our precarious\r\nposition and the lives of men in jeopardy, I sent this evening an\r\naerogram to H. M. King George asking for a relief ship. I hope the\r\nwireless gets through. I have sent this message after much\r\nconsideration, and know that in the event of our non-arrival in New\r\nZealand on the specified date (November 1) a relief ship will be sent\r\nto aid the Southern Party.\r\n\r\n“_July_ 25.—Very heavy pressure about the ship. During the early hours\r\na large field on the port quarter came charging up, and on meeting our\r\nfloe tossed up a ridge from ten to fifteen feet high. The blocks of ice\r\nas they broke off crumbled and piled over each other to the\r\naccompaniment of a thunderous roar. Throughout the day the pressure\r\ncontinued, the floes alternately opening and closing, and the ship\r\ncreaking and groaning during the nips between floes.\r\n\r\n“_August_ 4.—For nine days we have had southerly winds, and the last\r\nfour we have experienced howling blizzards. I am sick of the sound of\r\nthe infernal wind. Din! Din! Din! and darkness. We should have seen the\r\nsun to-day, but a bank of cumulus effectually hid him, although the\r\ndaylight is a never-ending joy.\r\n\r\n“_August_ 6.—The wind moderated towards 6 a.m., and about breakfast\r\ntime, with a clear atmosphere, the land from near Cape Cotter to Cape\r\nAdare was visible. What a day of delights! After four days of thick\r\nweather we find ourselves in sight of Cape Adare in a position about\r\nforty-five miles east of Possession Isles; in this time we have been\r\nset one hundred miles. Good going. Mount Sabine, the first land seen by\r\nus when coming south, lies away to the westward, forming the highest\r\npeak (10,000 ft.) of a majestic range of mountains covered in eternal\r\nsnow. Due west we can see the Possession Islands, lying under the\r\nstupendous bluff of Cape Downshire, which shows large patches of black\r\nrock. The land slopes down to the north-west of Cape Downshire, and\r\nrises again into the high peninsula about Cape Adore. We felt excited\r\nthis morning in anticipation of seeing the sun, which rose about\r\nnine-thirty (local time). It was a glorious, joyful sight. We drank to\r\nsomething, and with very light hearts gave cheers for the sun.\r\n\r\n“_August_ 9.—Donolly got to work on the rudder again. It is a long job\r\ncutting through the iron sheathing-plates of the rudder, and not too\r\nsafe at present, as the ice is treacherous. Hooke says that the\r\nconditions are normal now. I wish for his sake that he could get\r\nthrough. He is a good sportsman and keeps on trying, although, I am\r\nconvinced, he has little hope with this inadequate aerial.\r\n\r\n“_August_ 10.—The ship’s position is lat. 70° 40´ S., forty miles north\r\n29° east of Cape Adare. The distance drifted from August 2 to 6 was one\r\nhundred miles, and from the 6th to the 10th eighty-eight miles.\r\n\r\n“_August_ 12.—By observation and bearings of land we are forty-five\r\nmiles north-east of Cape Adare, in lat. 70° 42´ S. This position is a\r\nlittle to the eastward of the position on the 10th. The bearings as\r\nlaid off on a small scale chart of gnomonic projection are very\r\ninaccurate, and here we are handicapped, as our chronometers have lost\r\nall regularity. Donolly and Grade are having quite a job with the iron\r\nplatings on the rudder, but should finish the cutting to-morrow. A\r\njury-rudder is nearly completed. This afternoon we mixed some concrete\r\nfor the lower part, and had to use boiling water, as the water froze in\r\nthe mixing. The carpenter has made a good job of the rudder, although\r\nhe has had to construct it on the quarterdeck in low temperatures and\r\nexposed to biting blasts.\r\n\r\n“_August_ 16.—We are ‘backing and filling’ about forty miles north-east\r\nof Cape Adare. This is where we expected to have made much mileage.\r\nHowever, we cannot grumble and must be patient. There was much mirage\r\nto the northward, and from the crow’s-nest a distinct appearance of\r\nopen water could be seen stretching from north-north-west to\r\nnorth-east.\r\n\r\n“_August_ 17.—A glorious day! Land is distinctly visible, and to the\r\nnorthward the black fringe of water-sky over the horizon hangs\r\ncontinuously. Hooke heard Macquarie Island ‘speaking’ Hobart. The\r\nmessage heard was the finish of the weather reports. We have hopes now\r\nof news in the near future.\r\n\r\n“_August_ 23.—Saw the land in the vicinity of Cape North. To the\r\nsouth-south-west the white cliffs and peaks of the inland ranges were\r\nvery distinct, and away in the distance to the south-west could be seen\r\na low stretch of undulating land. At times Mount Sabine was visible\r\nthrough the gloom. The latitude, is 69° 44½´ S. We are fifty-eight\r\nmiles north, forty miles east of Cape North.\r\n\r\n“_August_ 24.—We lifted the rudder out of the ice and placed it clear\r\nof the stern, athwart the fore-and-aft line of the ship. We had quite a\r\njob with it (weight, four and a half tons), using treble- and\r\ndouble-sheaved-blocks purchase, but with the endless-chain tackle from\r\nthe engine-room, and plenty of ‘beef’ and leverage, we dragged it\r\nclear. All the pintles are gone at the fore part of the rudder; it is a\r\nclean break and bears witness to the terrific force exerted on the ship\r\nduring the nip. I am glad to see the rudder upon the ice and clear of\r\nthe propeller. The blade itself (which is solid oak and sheathed on two\r\nsides and after part half-way down, with three-quarter-inch iron\r\nplating) is undamaged, save for the broken pintles; the twisted portion\r\nis in the rudder trunk.\r\n\r\n“_August_ 25, 11 p.m.—Hooke has just been in with the good tidings that\r\nhe has heard Macquarie and the Bluff (New Zealand) sending their\r\nweather reports and exchanging signals. Can this mean that they have\r\nheard our recent signals and are trying to get us now? Our motor has\r\nbeen out of order.\r\n\r\n“_August_ 26.—The carpenter has finished the jury-rudder and is now at\r\nwork on the lower end of the rudder truck, where the rudder burst into\r\nthe stern timbers. We are lucky in having this opportunity to repair\r\nthese minor damages, which might prove serious in a seaway.\r\n\r\n“_August_ 31, 6.30 a.m.—Very loud pressure-noises to the south-east. I\r\nwent aloft after breakfast and had the pleasure of seeing many open\r\nlanes in all directions. The lanes of yesterday are frozen over,\r\nshowing what little chance there is of a general and continued break-up\r\nof the ice until the temperature rises. Land was visible, but far too\r\ndistant for even approximate bearings. The berg still hangs to the\r\nnorth-west of the ship. We seem to have pivoted outwards from the land.\r\nWe cannot get out of this too quickly, and although every one has\r\nplenty of work, and is cheerful, the uselessness of the ship in her\r\npresent position palls.\r\n\r\n“_September_ 5.—The mizzen wireless mast came down in a raging blizzard\r\nto-day. In the forenoon I managed to crawl to windward on the top of\r\nthe bridge-house, and under the lee of the chart-house watched the mast\r\nbending over with the wind and swaying like the branch of a tree, but\r\nafter the aerial had stood throughout the winter I hardly thought the\r\nmast would carry away. Luckily, as it is dangerous to life to be on\r\ndeck in this weather (food is brought from the galley in relays through\r\nblinding drift and over big heaps of snow), no one was about when the\r\nmast carried away.\r\n\r\n“_September_ 8.—This is dull, miserable weather. Blow, snow, and calm\r\nfor an hour or two. Sometimes it blows in this neighbourhood without\r\nsnow and sometimes with—this seems to be the only difference. I have\r\ntwo patients now, Larkman and Mugridge. Larkman was frost-bitten on the\r\ngreat and second toes of the left foot some time ago, and has so far\r\ntaken little notice of them. Now they are causing him some alarm as\r\ngangrene has set in. Mugridge is suffering from an intermittent rash,\r\nwith red, inflamed skin and large, short-lived blisters. I don’t know\r\nwhat the deuce it is, but the nearest description to it in a ‘Materia\r\nMedica,’ etc., is _pemphigus_, so pemphigus it is, and he has been\r\n‘tonic-ed’ and massaged.\r\n\r\n“_September_ 9.—This is the first day for a long time that we have\r\nregistered a minimum temperature above zero for the twenty-four hours.\r\nIt is pleasant to think that from noon to noon throughout the night the\r\ntemperature never fell below +4° (28° frost), and with the increase of\r\ndaylight it makes one feel that summer really is approaching.\r\n\r\n“_September_ 13.—All around the northern horizon there is the\r\nappearance of an open water-sky, but around the ship the prospect is\r\ndreary. The sun rose at 6.20 a.m. and set at 5.25 p.m. Ship’s time\r\neleven hours five minutes of sunlight and seventeen hours light. Three\r\nhours twilight morning and evening. The carpenter is dismantling the\r\ntaffrail (to facilitate the landing and, if necessary, the boarding of\r\nthe jury-rudder) and will construct a temporary, removable rail.\r\n\r\n“_September_ 16.—There has been much mirage all around the horizon, and\r\nto the eastward through south to south-west heavy frost-smoke has been\r\nrising. Over the northern horizon a low bank of white fog hangs as\r\nthough over the sea. I do not like these continued low temperatures. I\r\nam beginning to have doubts as to our release until the sun starts to\r\nrot the ice.\r\n\r\n“_September_ 17.—This is the anniversary of our departure from London.\r\nThere are only four of the original eleven on board—Larkman, Ninnis,\r\nMauger, and I. Much has happened since Friday, September 18, 1914, and\r\nI can recall the scene as we passed down the Thames with submarines and\r\ncruisers, in commission and bent on business, crossing our course. I\r\ncan also remember the regret at leaving it all and the consequent\r\n‘fedupness.’\r\n\r\n“_September_ 21.—The sun is making rapid progress south, and we have\r\nhad to-day over seventeen hours’ light and twelve hours’ sunlight. Oh\r\nfor a release! The monotony and worry of our helpless position is\r\ndeadly. I suppose Shackleton and his party will have started\r\ndepot-laying now and will be full of hopes for the future. I wonder\r\nwhether the _Endurance_ wintered in the ice or went north. I cannot\r\nhelp thinking that if she wintered in the Weddell Sea she will be worse\r\noff than the _Aurora_. What a lot we have to look for in the next six\r\nmonths—news of Shackleton and the _Endurance_, the party at Cape Evans,\r\nand the war.\r\n\r\n“_September_ 22.—Lat. 69° 12´ S.; long. 165° 00´ E. Sturge Island\r\n(Balleny Group) is bearing north (true) ninety miles distant. Light\r\nnorth-west airs with clear, fine weather. Sighted Sturge Island in the\r\nmorning, bearing due north of us and appearing like a faint low shadow\r\non the horizon. It is good to get a good landmark for fixing positions\r\nagain, and it is good to see that we are making northerly progress,\r\nhowever small. Since breaking away from Cape Evans we have drifted\r\nroughly seven hundred and five miles around islands and past formidable\r\nobstacles, a wonderful drift! It is good to think that it has not been\r\nin vain, and that the knowledge of the set and drill of the pack will\r\nbe a valuable addition to the sum of human knowledge. The distance from\r\nCape Evans to our present position is seven hundred and five miles\r\n(geographical).\r\n\r\n“_September_ 27.—The temperature in my room last night was round about\r\nzero, rather chilly, but warm enough under the blankets. Hooke has\r\ndismantled his wireless gear. He feels rather sick about not getting\r\ncommunication, although he does not show it.\r\n\r\n“_September_ 30.—Ninnis has been busy now for the week on the\r\nconstruction of a new tractor. He is building the body and will\r\nassemble the motor in the fore ’tween decks, where it can be lashed\r\nsecurely when we are released from the ice. I can see leads of open\r\nwater from the masthead, but we are still held firmly. How long?\r\n\r\n“_October_ 7.—As time wears on the possibility of getting back to the\r\nBarrier to land a party deserves consideration; if we do not get clear\r\nuntil late in the season we will have to turn south first, although we\r\nhave no anchors and little moorings, no rudder and a short supply of\r\ncoal. To leave a party on the Barrier would make us very short-handed;\r\nstill, it can be done, and anything is preferable to the delay in\r\nassisting the people at Cape Evans. At 5 a.m. a beautiful parhelion\r\nformed around the sun. The sight so impressed the bos’n that he roused\r\nme out to see it.”\r\n\r\nDuring the month of October the _Aurora_ drifted uneventfully.\r\nStenhouse mentions that there was often an appearance of open water on\r\nthe northern and eastern horizon. But anxious eyes were strained in\r\nvain for indications that the day of the ship’s release was near at\r\nhand. Hooke had the wireless plant running again and was trying daily\r\nto get into touch with Macquarie Island, now about eight hundred and\r\nfifty miles distant. The request for a relief ship was to be renewed if\r\ncommunication could be established, for by this time, if all had gone\r\nwell with the _Endurance_, the overland party from the Weddell Sea\r\nwould have been starting. There was considerable movement of the ice\r\ntowards the end of the month, lanes opening and closing, but the floe,\r\nsome acres in area, into which the _Aurora_ was frozen, remained firm\r\nuntil the early days of November. The cracks appeared close to the\r\nship, due apparently to heavy drift causing the floe to sink. The\r\ntemperatures were higher now, under the influence of the sun, and the\r\nice was softer. Thawing was causing discomfort in the quarters aboard.\r\nThe position on November 12 was reckoned to be lat. 66° 49´ S., long.\r\n155° 17´ 45´´ E. Stenhouse made a sounding on November 17, in lat. 66°\r\n40´ S., long. 154° 45´ E., and found bottom at 194 fathoms. The bottom\r\nsample was mud and a few small stones. The sounding-line showed a\r\nfairly strong undercurrent to the north-west. “We panned out some of\r\nthe mud,” says Stenhouse, “and in the remaining grit found several\r\nspecks of gold.” Two days later the trend of the current was\r\nsouth-easterly. There was a pronounced thaw on the 22nd. The cabins\r\nwere in a dripping state, and recently fallen snow was running off the\r\nship in little streams. All hands were delighted, for the present\r\ndiscomfort offered promise of an early break-up of the pack.\r\n\r\n“_November_ 23.—At 3 a.m. Young Island, Balleny Group, was seen bearing\r\nnorth 54° east (true). The island, which showed up clearly on the\r\nhorizon, under a heavy stratus-covered sky, appeared to be very far\r\ndistant. By latitude at noon we are in 66° 26´ S. As this is the\r\ncharted latitude of Peak Foreman, Young Island, the bearing does not\r\nagree. Land was seen at 8 a.m. bearing south 60° west (true). This,\r\nwhich would appear to be Cape Hudson, loomed up through the mists in\r\nthe form of a high, bold headland, with low undulating land stretching\r\naway to the south-south-east and to the westward of it. The appearance\r\nof this headland has been foretold for the last two days, by masses of\r\nblack fog, but it seems strange that land so high should not have been\r\nseen before, as there is little change in the atmospheric conditions.\r\n\r\n“_November_ 24.—Overcast and hazy during forenoon. Cloudy, clear, and\r\nfine in afternoon and evening. Not a vestige of land can be seen, so\r\nCape Hudson is really ‘Cape Flyaway.’ This is most weird. All hands saw\r\nthe headland to the south-west, and some of us sketched it. Now\r\n(afternoon), although the sky is beautifully clear to the south-west,\r\nnothing can be seen. We cannot have drifted far from yesterday’s\r\nposition. No wonder Wilkes reported land. 9 p.m.—A low fringe of land\r\nappears on the horizon bearing south-west, but in no way resembles our\r\nCape of yesterday. This afternoon we took a cast of the lead through\r\nthe crack 200 yds. west of the ship, but found no bottom at 700\r\nfathoms.”\r\n\r\nAn interesting incident on November 26 was the discovery of an emperor\r\npenguin rookery. Ninnis and Kavenagh took a long walk to the\r\nnorth-west, and found the deserted rookery. The depressions in the ice,\r\nmade by the birds, were about eighteen inches long and contained a\r\ngreyish residue. The rookery was in a hollow surrounded by pressure\r\nridges six feet high. Apparently about twenty birds had been there. No\r\npieces of egg-shell were seen, but the petrels and skuas had been there\r\nin force and probably would have taken all scraps of this kind. The\r\nfloes were becoming soft and “rotten,” and walking was increasingly\r\ndifficult. Deep pools of slush and water covered with thin snow made\r\ntraps for the men. Stenhouse thought that a stiff blizzard would break\r\nup the pack. His anxiety was increasing with the advance of the season,\r\nand his log is a record of deep yearning to be free and active again.\r\nBut the grip of the pack was inexorable. The hands had plenty of work\r\non the _Aurora_, which was being made shipshape after the buffeting of\r\nthe winter storms. Seals and penguins were seen frequently, and the\r\nsupply of fresh meat was maintained. The jury-rudder was ready to be\r\nshipped when the ship was released, but in the meantime it was not\r\nbeing exposed to the attacks of the ice.\r\n\r\n“No appreciable change in our surroundings,” was the note for December\r\n17. “Every day past now reduces our chance of getting out in time to go\r\nnorth for rudder, anchors, and coal. If we break out before January 15\r\nwe might get north to New Zealand and down to Cape Evans again in time\r\nto pick up the parties. After that date we can only attempt to go south\r\nin our crippled state, and short of fuel. With only nine days’ coal on\r\nboard we would have little chance of working through any Ross Sea pack,\r\nor of getting south at all if we encountered many blizzards. Still\r\nthere is a sporting chance and luck may be with us.... Shackleton may\r\nbe past the Pole now. I wish our wireless calls had got through.”\r\n\r\nChristmas Day, with its special dinner and mild festivities, came and\r\npassed, and still the ice remained firm. The men were finding some\r\ninterest in watching the moulting of emperor penguins, who were\r\nstationed at various points in the neighbourhood of the ship. They had\r\ntaken station to leeward of hummocks, and appeared to move only when\r\nthe wind changed or the snow around them had become foul. They covered\r\nbut a few yards on these journeys, and even then stumbled in their\r\nweakness. One emperor was brought on board alive, and the crew were\r\ngreatly amused to see the bird balancing himself on heels and tail,\r\nwith upturned toes, the position adopted when the egg is resting on the\r\nfeet during the incubation period. The threat of a stiff “blow” aroused\r\nhopes of release several times, but the blizzard—probably the first\r\nAntarctic blizzard that was ever longed for—did not arrive. New Year’s\r\nDay found Stenhouse and other men just recovering from an attack of\r\nsnow-blindness, contracted by making an excursion across the floes\r\nwithout snow-goggles.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first week in January the ship was in lat. 65° 45´ S.\r\nThe pack was well broken a mile from the ship, and the ice was rolling\r\nfast. Under the bows and stern the pools were growing and stretching\r\naway in long lanes to the west. A seal came up to blow under the stern\r\non the 6th, proving that there was an opening in the sunken ice there.\r\nStenhouse was economizing in food. No breakfast was served on the ship,\r\nand seal or penguin meat was used for at least one of the two meals\r\nlater in the day. All hands were short of clothing, but Stenhouse was\r\nkeeping intact the sledging gear intended for the use of the shore\r\nparty. Strong, variable winds on the 9th raised hopes again, and on the\r\nmorning of the 10th the ice appeared to be well broken from half a mile\r\nto a mile distant from the ship in all directions. “It seems\r\nextraordinary that the ship should be held in an almost unbroken floe\r\nof about a mile square, the more so as this patch was completely\r\nscrewed and broken during the smash in July, and contains many faults.\r\nIn almost any direction at a distance of half a mile from the ship\r\nthere are pressure ridges of eight-inch ice piled twenty feet high. It\r\nwas provident that although so near these ridges were escaped.”\r\n\r\nThe middle of January was passed and the _Aurora_ lay still in the ice.\r\nThe period of continuous day was drawing towards its close, and there\r\nwas an appreciable twilight at midnight. A dark water-sky could be seen\r\non the northern horizon. The latitude on January 24 was 65° 39½´ S.\r\nTowards the end of the month Stenhouse ordered a thorough overhaul of\r\nthe stores and general preparations for a move. The supply of flour and\r\nbutter was ample. Other stores were running low, and the crew lost no\r\nopportunity of capturing seals and penguins. Adelies were travelling to\r\nthe east-south-east in considerable numbers, but they could not be\r\ntaken unless they approached the ship closely, owing to the soft\r\ncondition of the ice. The wireless plant, which had been idle during\r\nthe months of daylight, had been rigged again, and Hooke resumed his\r\ncalls to Macquarie Island on February 2. He listened in vain for any\r\nindication that he had been heard. The pack was showing much movement,\r\nbut the large floe containing the ship remained firm.\r\n\r\nThe break-up of the floe came on February 12. Strong north-east to\r\nsouth-east winds put the ice in motion and brought a perceptible swell.\r\nThe ship was making some water, a fore-taste of a trouble to come, and\r\nall hands spent the day at the pumps, reducing the water from three\r\nfeet eight and a half inches in the well to twelve inches, in spite of\r\nfrozen pipes and other difficulties. Work had just finished for the\r\nnight when the ice broke astern and quickly split in all directions\r\nunder the influence of the swell. The men managed to save some seal\r\nmeat which had been cached in a drift near the gangway. They lost the\r\nflagstaff, which had been rigged as a wireless mast out on the floe,\r\nbut drew in the aerial. The ship was floating now amid fragments of\r\nfloe, and bumping considerably in the swell. A fresh southerly wind\r\nblew during the night, and the ship started to forge ahead gradually\r\nwithout sail. At 8.30 a.m. on the 13th Stenhouse set the foresail and\r\nforetopmast staysail, and the _Aurora_ moved northward slowly, being\r\nbrought up occasionally by large floes. Navigation under such\r\nconditions, without steam and without a rudder, was exceedingly\r\ndifficult, but Stenhouse wished if possible to save his small remaining\r\nstock of coal until he cleared the pack, so that a quick run might be\r\nmade to McMurdo Sound. The jury-rudder could not be rigged in the pack.\r\nThe ship was making about three and a half feet of water in the\r\ntwenty-four hours, a quantity easily kept in check by the pumps.\r\n\r\nDuring the 14th the _Aurora_ worked very slowly northward through heavy\r\npack. Occasionally the yards were backed or an ice-anchor put into a\r\nfloe to help her out of difficult places, but much of the time she\r\nsteered herself. The jury-rudder boom was topped into position in the\r\nafternoon, but the rudder was not to be shipped until open pack or open\r\nwater was reached. The ship was held up all day on the 15th in lat. 64°\r\n38´ S. Heavy floes barred progress in every direction. Attempts were\r\nmade to work the ship by trimming sails and warping with ice-anchors,\r\nbut she could not be manœuvred smartly enough to take advantage of\r\nleads that opened and closed. This state of affairs continued\r\nthroughout the 16th. That night a heavy swell was rolling under the ice\r\nand the ship had a rough time. One pointed floe ten or twelve feet\r\nthick was steadily battering, with a three-feet send, against the\r\nstarboard side, and fenders only partially deadened the shock. “It is\r\nno use butting against this pack with steam-power,” wrote Stenhouse.\r\n“We would use all our meagre supply of coal in reaching the limit of\r\nthe ice in sight, and then we would be in a hole, with neither ballast\r\nnor fuel.... But if this stagnation lasts another week we will have to\r\nraise steam and consume our coal in an endeavour to get into navigable\r\nwaters. I am afraid our chances of getting south are very small now.”\r\n\r\nThe pack remained close, and on the 21st a heavy swell made the\r\nsituation dangerous. The ship bumped heavily that night and fenders\r\nwere of little avail. With each “send” of the swell the ship would bang\r\nher bows on the floe ahead, then bounce back and smash into another\r\nfloe across her stern-post. This floe, about six feet thick and 100 ft.\r\nacross, was eventually split and smashed by the impacts. The pack was\r\njammed close on the 23rd, when the noon latitude was 64° 36½´ S. The\r\nnext change was for the worse. The pack loosened on the night of the\r\n25th, and a heavy north-west swell caused the ship to bump heavily.\r\nThis state of affairs recurred at intervals in succeeding days. “The\r\nbattering and ramming of the floes increased in the early hours [of\r\nFebruary 29] until it seemed as if some sharp floe or jagged underfoot\r\nmust go through the ship’s hull. At 6 a.m. we converted a large\r\ncoir-spring into a fender, and slipped it under the port quarter, where\r\na pressured floe with twenty to thirty feet underfoot was threatening\r\ntry knock the propeller and stern-post off altogether. At 9 a.m., after\r\npumping ship, the engineer reported a leak in the way of the\r\npropeller-shaft aft near the stern-post on the port side. The carpenter\r\ncut part of the lining and filled the space between the timbers with\r\nStockholm tar, cement, and oakum. He could not get at the actual leak,\r\nbut his makeshift made a little difference. I am anxious about the\r\npropeller. This pack is a dangerous place for a ship now; it seems\r\nmiraculous that the old Barky still floats.”\r\n\r\nThe ice opened out a little on March 1. It was imperative to get the\r\nship out of her dangerous situation quickly; as winter was approaching,\r\nand Stenhouse therefore ordered steam to be raised. Next morning he had\r\nthe spanker gaff rigged over the stern for use as a temporary rudder\r\nwhile in the heavy pack. Steam had been raised to working pressure at\r\n5.15 p.m. on the 2nd, and the _Aurora_ began to work ahead to the\r\nwestward. Progress was very slow owing to heavy floes and deep\r\nunderfoots, which necessitated frequent stoppages of the engines. Open\r\nwater was in sight to the north and north-west the next morning, after\r\na restless night spent among the rocking floes. But progress was very\r\nslow. The _Aurora_ went to leeward under the influence of a\r\nwest-south-west breeze, and steering by means of the yards and a\r\nwarp-anchor was a ticklish business. The ship came to a full stop among\r\nheavy floes before noon on the 3rd, and three hours later, after vain\r\nattempts to warp ahead by means of ice-anchors, Stenhouse had the fires\r\npartially drawn (to save coal) and banked.\r\n\r\nNo advance was made on March 4 and 5. A moderate gale from the\r\neast-north-east closed the ice and set it in motion, and the _Aurora_,\r\nwith banked fires, rolled and bumped, heavily. Seventeen bergs were in\r\nsight, and one of them was working southwards into the pack and\r\nthreatening to approach the ship. During the night the engines were\r\nturned repeatedly by the action of ice on the propeller blades. “All\r\ntheories about the swell being non-existent in the pack are false,”\r\nwrote the anxious master. “Here we are with a suggestion only of open\r\nwater-sky, and the ship rolling her scuppers under and sitting down\r\nbodily on the floes.” The ice opened when the wind moderated, and on\r\nthe afternoon of the 6th the _Aurora_ moved northward again. “Without a\r\nrudder (no jury-rudder can yet be used amongst these swirling, rolling\r\nfloes) the ship requires a lot of attention. Her head must be pointed\r\nbetween floes by means of ice-anchors and warps, or by mooring to a\r\nfloe and steaming round it. We kept a fairly good course between two\r\nbergs to our northward and made about five miles northing till,\r\ndarkness coming on, the men could no longer venture on the floes with\r\nsafety to fix the anchors.”\r\n\r\nThe next three days were full of anxiety. The _Aurora_ was held by the\r\nice, and subjected to severe buffeting, while two bergs approached from\r\nthe north. On the morning of the 10th the nearest berg was within three\r\ncables of the ship. But the pack had opened and by 9.30 a.m. the ship\r\nwas out of the danger zone and headed north-north-east. The pack\r\ncontinued to open during the afternoon, and the _Aurora_ passed through\r\nwide stretches of small loose floes and brash. Progress was good until\r\ndarkness made a stop necessary. The next morning the pack was denser.\r\nStenhouse shipped a preventer jury-rudder (the weighted spanker gaff),\r\nbut could not get steerage way. Broad leads were sighted to the\r\nnorth-west in the afternoon, and the ship got within a quarter of a\r\nmile of the nearest lead before being held up by heavy pack. She again\r\nbumped severely during the night, and the watch stood by with fenders\r\nto ease the more dangerous blows.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning Stenhouse lowered a jury-rudder, with steering\r\npennants to drag through the water, and moved north to north-west\r\nthrough heavy pack. He made sixteen miles that day on an erratic\r\ncourse, and then spent an anxious night with the ship setting back into\r\nthe pack and being pounded heavily. Attempts to work forward to an open\r\nlead on the morning of the 13th were unsuccessful. Early in the\r\nafternoon a little progress was made, with all hands standing by to\r\nfend off high ice, and at 4.50 p.m. the _Aurora_ cleared the main pack.\r\nAn hour was spent shipping the jury-rudder under the counter, and then\r\nthe ship moved slowly northward. There was pack still ahead, and the\r\nbergs and growlers were a constant menace in the hours of darkness.\r\nSome anxious work remained to be done, since bergs and scattered ice\r\nextended in all directions, but at 2 p.m. on March 14 the _Aurora_\r\ncleared the last belt of pack in lat. 62° 27.5´ S., long. 157° 32´ E.\r\n“We ‘spliced the main brace,’” says Stenhouse, “and blew three blasts\r\nof farewell to the pack with the whistle.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Next Morning the Jury-Rudder was Shipped”]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Aurora_ was not at the end of her troubles, but the voyage up to\r\nNew Zealand need not be described in detail. Any attempt to reach\r\nMcMurdo Sound was now out of the question. Stenhouse had a battered,\r\nrudderless ship, with only a few tons of coal left in the bunkers, and\r\nhe struggled northward in heavy weather against persistent adverse\r\nwinds and head seas. The jury-rudder needed constant nursing, and the\r\nshortage of coal made it impossible to get the best service from the\r\nengines. There were times when the ship could make no progress and fell\r\nabout helplessly in a confused swell or lay hove to amid mountainous\r\nseas. She was short-handed, and one or two of the men were creating\r\nadditional difficulties. But Stenhouse displayed throughout fine\r\nseamanship and dogged perseverance. He accomplished successfully one of\r\nthe most difficult voyages on record, in an ocean area notoriously\r\nstormy and treacherous. On March 23 he established wireless\r\ncommunication with Bluff Station, New Zealand, and the next day was in\r\ntouch with Wellington and Hobart. The naval officer in New Zealand\r\nwaters offered assistance, and eventually it was arranged that the\r\nOtago Harbour Board’s tug _Plucky_ should meet the _Aurora_ outside\r\nPort Chalmers. There were still bad days to be endured. The jury-rudder\r\npartially carried away and had to be unshipped in a heavy sea.\r\nStenhouse carried on, and in the early morning of April 2 the _Aurora_\r\npicked up the tug and was taken in tow. She reached Port Chalmers the\r\nfollowing morning, and was welcomed with the warm hospitality that New\r\nZealand has always shown towards Antarctic explorers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\nTHE LAST RELIEF\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I reached New Zealand at the beginning of December 1916, I found\r\nthat the arrangements for the relief were complete. The New Zealand\r\nGovernment had taken the task in hand earlier in the year, before I had\r\ngot into touch with the outside world. The British and Australian\r\nGovernments were giving financial assistance. The _Aurora_ had been\r\nrepaired and refitted at Port Chalmers during the year at considerable\r\ncost, and had been provisioned and coaled for the voyage to McMurdo\r\nSound. My old friend Captain John K. Davis, who was a member of my\r\nfirst Antarctic Expedition in 1907–1909, and who subsequently commanded\r\nDr. Mawson’s ship in the Australian Antarctic Expedition, had been\r\nplaced in command of the _Aurora_ by the Governments, and he had\r\nengaged officers, engineers, and crew. Captain Davis came to Wellington\r\nto see me on my arrival there, and I heard his account of the position.\r\nI had interviews also with the Minister for Marine, the late Dr. Robert\r\nMcNab, a kindly and sympathetic Scotsman who took a deep personal\r\ninterest in the Expedition. Stenhouse also was in Wellington, and I may\r\nsay again here that his account of his voyage and drift in the _Aurora_\r\nfilled me with admiration for his pluck, seamanship, and\r\nresourcefulness.\r\n\r\nAfter discussing the situation fully with Dr. McNab, I agreed that the\r\narrangements already made for the relief expedition should stand. Time\r\nwas important and there were difficulties about making any change of\r\nplans or control at the last moment. After Captain Davis had been at\r\nwork for some months the Government agreed to hand the _Aurora_ over to\r\nme free of liability on her return to New Zealand. It was decided,\r\ntherefore, that Captain Davis should take the ship down to McMurdo\r\nSound, and that I should go with him to take charge of any shore\r\noperations that might be necessary. I “signed on” at a salary of 1s. a\r\nmonth, and we sailed from Port Chalmers on December 20, 1916. A week\r\nlater we sighted ice again. The _Aurora_ made a fairly quick passage\r\nthrough the pack and entered the open water of the Ross Sea on January\r\n7, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ice Nomenclature: 1. Young Ice (Bay Ice of Scoresby)\r\nin the Middle Distance]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2. Light Pack]\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Davis brought the _Aurora_ alongside the ice edge off Cape\r\nRoyds on the morning of January 10, and I went ashore with a party to\r\nlook for some record in the hut erected there by my Expedition in 1907.\r\nI found a letter stating that the Ross Sea party was housed at Cape\r\nEvans, and was on my way back to the ship when six men, with dogs and\r\nsledge, were sighted coming from the direction of Cape Evans. At 1 p.m.\r\nthis party arrived on board, and we learned that of the ten members of\r\nthe Expedition left behind when the _Aurora_ broke away on May 6, 1915,\r\nseven had survived, namely, A. Stevens, E. Joyce, H. E. Wild, J. L.\r\nCope, R. W. Richards, A. K. Jack, I. O. Gaze. These seven men were all\r\nwell, though they showed traces of the ordeal through which they had\r\npassed. They told us of the deaths of Mackintosh, Spencer-Smith, and\r\nHayward, and of their own anxious wait for relief.\r\n\r\nAll that remained to be done was to make a final search for the bodies\r\nof Mackintosh and Hayward. There was no possibility of either man being\r\nalive. They had been without equipment when the blizzard broke the ice\r\nthey were crossing. It would have been impossible for them to have\r\nsurvived more than a few days, and eight months had now elapsed without\r\nnews of them. Joyce had already searched south of Glacier Tongue. I\r\nconsidered that further search should be made in two directions, the\r\narea north of Glacier Tongue, and the old depot off Butler Point, and I\r\nmade a report to Captain Davis to this effect.\r\n\r\nOn January 12 the ship reached a point five and a half miles east of\r\nButler Point. I took a party across rubbly and waterlogged ice to\r\nwithin thirty yards of the piedmont ice, but owing to high cliffs and\r\nloose slushy ice could not make a landing. The land-ice had broken away\r\nat the point cut by the cross-bearings of the depot, but was visible in\r\nthe form of two large bergs grounded to the north of Cape Bernacchi.\r\nThere was no sign of the depot or of any person having visited the\r\nvicinity. We returned to the ship and proceeded across the Sound to\r\nCape Bernacchi.\r\n\r\nThe next day I took a party ashore with the object of searching the\r\narea north of Glacier Tongue, including Razorback Island, for traces of\r\nthe two missing men. We reached the Cape Evans Hut at 1.30 p.m., and\r\nJoyce and I left at 3 p.m. for the Razorbacks. We conducted a search\r\nround both islands, returning to the hut at 7 p.m. The search had been\r\nfruitless. On the 14th I started with Joyce to search the north side of\r\nGlacier Tongue, but the surface drift, with wind from south-east,\r\ndecided me not to continue, as the ice was moving rapidly at the end of\r\nCape Evans, and the pool between the hut and Inaccessible Island was\r\ngrowing larger. The wind increased in the afternoon. The next day a\r\nsouth-east blizzard was blowing, with drift half up the islands. I\r\nconsidered it unsafe to sledge that day, especially as the ice was\r\nbreaking away from the south side of Cape Evans into the pool. We spent\r\nthe day putting the hut in order.\r\n\r\nWe got up at 3 a.m. on the 16th. The weather was fine and calm. I\r\nstarted at 4.20 with Joyce to the south at the greatest possible speed.\r\nWe reached Glacier Tongue about one and a half miles from the seaward\r\nend. Wherever there were not precipitous cliffs there was an even\r\nsnow-slope to the top. From the top we searched with glasses; there was\r\nnothing to be seen but blue ice, crevassed, showing no protuberances.\r\nWe came down and, half running, half walking, worked about three miles\r\ntowards the root of the glacier; but I could see there was not the\r\nslightest chance of finding any remains owing to the enormous\r\nsnowdrifts wherever the cliffs were accessible. The base of the steep\r\ncliffs had drifts ten to fifteen feet high. We arrived back at the hut\r\nat 9.40, and left almost immediately for the ship. I considered that\r\nall places likely to hold the bodies of Mackintosh and Hayward had now\r\nbeen searched. There was no doubt to my mind that they met their deaths\r\non the breaking of the thin ice when the blizzard arose on May 8, 1916.\r\nDuring my absence from the hut Wild and Jack had erected a cross to the\r\nmemory of the three men who had lost their lives in the service of the\r\nExpedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3. Heavy Hummocked Pack]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 4. Hummocky Pack and Frozen Lead of Young-Ice]\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Davis took the ship northward on January 17. The ice conditions\r\nwere unfavourable and pack barred the way. We stood over to the western\r\ncoast towards Dunlop Island and followed it to Granite Harbour. No mark\r\nor depot of any kind was seen. The _Aurora_ reached the main pack,\r\nabout sixty miles from Cape Adare, on January 22. The ice was closed\r\nahead, and Davis went south in open water to wait for better\r\nconditions. A north-west gale on January 28 enabled the ship to pass\r\nbetween the pack and the land off Cape Adare, and we crossed the\r\nAntarctic Circle on the last day of the month. On February 4 Davis sent\r\na formal report to the New Zealand Government by wireless, and on\r\nFebruary 9 the _Aurora_ was berthed at Wellington. We were welcomed\r\nlike returned brothers by the New Zealand people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\nTHE FINAL PHASE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing chapters of this book represent the general narrative of\r\nour Expedition. That we failed in accomplishing the object we set out\r\nfor was due, I venture to assert, not to any neglect or lack of\r\norganization, but to the overwhelming natural obstacles, especially the\r\nunprecedentedly severe summer conditions on the Weddell Sea side. But\r\nthough the Expedition was a failure in one respect, I think it was\r\nsuccessful in many others. A large amount of important scientific work\r\nwas carried out. The meteorological observations in particular have an\r\neconomic bearing. The hydrographical work in the Weddell Sea has done\r\nmuch to clear up the mystery of this, the least known of all the seas.\r\nI have appended a short scientific memorandum to this volume, but the\r\nmore detailed scientific results must wait until a more suitable time\r\narrives, when more stable conditions prevail. Then results will be\r\nworked out.\r\n\r\nTo the credit side of the Expedition one can safely say that the\r\ncomradeship and resource of the members of the Expedition was worthy of\r\nthe highest traditions of Polar service; and it was a privilege to me\r\nto have had under my command men who, through dark days and the stress\r\nand strain of continuous danger, kept up their spirits and carried out\r\ntheir work regardless of themselves and heedless of the limelight. The\r\nsame energy and endurance that they showed in the Antarctic they\r\nbrought to the greater war in the Old World. And having followed our\r\nfortunes in the South you may be interested to know that practically\r\nevery member of the Expedition was employed in one or other branches of\r\nthe active fighting forces during the war. Several are still abroad,\r\nand for this very reason it has been impossible for me to obtain\r\ncertain details for this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 5. Close Pack]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 6. Open Pack]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the fifty-three men who returned out of the fifty-six who left for\r\nthe South, three have since been killed and five wounded. Four\r\ndecorations have been won, and several members of the Expedition have\r\nbeen mentioned in dispatches. McCarthy, the best and most efficient of\r\nthe sailors, always cheerful under the most trying circumstances, and\r\nwho for these very reasons I chose to accompany me on the boat journey\r\nto South Georgia, was killed at his gun in the Channel. Cheetham, the\r\nveteran of the Antarctic, who had been more often south of the\r\nAntarctic circle than any man, was drowned when the vessel he was\r\nserving in was torpedoed, a few weeks before the Armistice. Ernest\r\nWild, Frank Wild’s brother, was killed while minesweeping in the\r\nMediterranean. Mauger, the carpenter on the _Aurora_, was badly wounded\r\nwhile serving with the New Zealand Infantry, so that he is unable to\r\nfollow his trade again. He is now employed by the New Zealand\r\nGovernment. The two surgeons, Macklin and McIlroy, served in France and\r\nItaly, McIlroy being badly wounded at Ypres. Frank Wild, in view of his\r\nunique experience of ice and ice conditions, was at once sent to the\r\nNorth Russian front, where his zeal and ability won him the highest\r\npraise.\r\n\r\nMacklin served first with the Yorks and later transferred as medical\r\nofficer to the Tanks, where he did much good work. Going to the Italian\r\nfront with his battalion, he won the Military Cross for bravery in\r\ntending wounded under fire.\r\n\r\nJames joined the Royal Engineers, Sound Ranging Section, and after much\r\nfront-line work was given charge of a Sound Ranging School to teach\r\nother officers this latest and most scientific addition to the art of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nWordie went to France with the Royal Field Artillery and was badly\r\nwounded at Armentières.\r\n\r\nHussey was in France for eighteen months with the Royal Garrison\r\nArtillery, serving in every big battle from Dixmude to Saint-Quentin.\r\n\r\nWorsley, known to his intimates as Depth-Charge Bill, owing to his\r\nsuccess with that particular method of destroying German submarines,\r\nhas the Distinguished Service Order and three submarines to his credit.\r\n\r\nStenhouse, who commanded the _Aurora_ after Mackintosh landed, was with\r\nWorsley as his second in command when one of the German submarines was\r\nrammed and sunk, and received the D.S.C. for his share in the fight. He\r\nwas afterwards given command of a Mystery Ship, and fought several\r\nactions with enemy submarines.\r\n\r\nClark served on a mine-sweeper. Greenstreet was employed with the\r\nbarges on the Tigris. Rickenson was commissioned as\r\nEngineer-Lieutenant, R.N. Kerr returned to the Merchant Service as an\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\nMost of the crew of the _Endurance_ served on minesweepers.\r\n\r\nOf the Ross Sea Party, Mackintosh, Hayward, and Spencer-Smith died for\r\ntheir country as surely as any who gave up their lives on the fields of\r\nFrance and Flanders. Hooke, the wireless operator, now navigates an\r\nairship.\r\n\r\nNearly all of the crew of the _Aurora_ joined the New Zealand Field\r\nForces and saw active service in one or other of the many theatres of\r\nwar. Several have been wounded, but it has been impossible to obtain\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nOn my return, after the rescue of the survivors of the Ross Sea Party,\r\nI offered my services to the Government, and was sent on a mission to\r\nSouth America. When this was concluded I was commissioned as Major and\r\nwent to North Russia in charge of Arctic Equipment and Transport,\r\nhaving with me Worsley, Stenhouse, Hussey, Macklin, and Brocklehurst,\r\nwho was to have come South with us, but who, as a regular officer,\r\nrejoined his unit on the outbreak of war. He has been wounded three\r\ntimes and was in the retreat from Mons. Worsley was sent across to the\r\nArchangel front, where he did excellent work, and the others served\r\nwith me on the Murmansk front. The mobile columns there had exactly the\r\nsame clothing, equipment, and sledging food as we had on the\r\nExpedition. No expense was spared to obtain the best of everything for\r\nthem, and as a result not a single case of avoidable frost-bite was\r\nreported.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 7. Very Open Pack, approximating to Drift-ice]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 8. Drift-Ice]\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking the Expedition as a unit, out of fifty-six men three died in the\r\nAntarctic, three were killed in action, and five have been wounded, so\r\nthat our casualties have been fairly high.\r\n\r\nThough some have gone there are enough left to rally round and form a\r\nnucleus for the next Expedition, when troublous times are over and\r\nscientific exploration can once more be legitimately undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nBy J. M. WORDIE, M.A. (Cantab.), Lieut. R.F.A.\r\n\r\nThe research undertaken by the Expedition was originally planned for a\r\nshore party working from a fixed base on land, but it was only in South\r\nGeorgia that this condition of affairs was fully realized. On this\r\nisland, where a full month was spent, the geologist made very extensive\r\ncollections, and began the mapping of the country; the magnetician had\r\nsome of his instruments in working order for a short while; and the\r\nmeteorologist was able to co-operate with the Argentine observer\r\nstationed at Grytviken. It had been realized how important the\r\nmeteorological observations were going to be to the Argentine\r\nGovernment, and they accordingly did all in their power to help, both\r\nbefore and at the end of the Expedition. The biologist devoted most of\r\nhis time, meanwhile, to the whaling industry, there being no less than\r\nseven stations on the island; he also made collections of the neritic\r\nfauna, and, accompanied by the photographer, studied the bird life and\r\nthe habits of the sea-elephants along the east coast.\r\n\r\nBy the time the actual southern voyage commenced, each individual had\r\nhis own particular line of work which he was prepared to follow out.\r\nThe biologist at first confined himself to collecting the _plankton_,\r\nand a start was made in securing water samples for temperature and\r\nsalinity. In this, from the beginning, he had the help of the\r\ngeologist, who also gave instructions for the taking of a line of\r\nsoundings under the charge of the ship’s officers. This period of the\r\nsouthward voyage was a very busy time so far as the scientists were\r\nconcerned, for, besides their own particular work, they took the full\r\nshare of looking after the dogs and working the ship watch by watch. At\r\nthe same time, moreover, the biologist had to try and avoid being too\r\nlavish with his preserving material at the expense of the shore station\r\ncollections which were yet to make.\r\n\r\nWhen it was finally known that the ship had no longer any chance of\r\ngetting free of the ice in the 1914–1915 season, a radical change was\r\nmade in the arrangements. The scientists were freed, as far as\r\npossible, from ship’s duties, and were thus able to devote themselves\r\nalmost entirely to their own particular spheres. The meteorological\r\ninvestigations took on a more definite shape; the instruments intended\r\nfor the land base were set up on board ship, including self-recording\r\nbarographs, thermometers, and a Dines anemometer, with which very\r\nsatisfactory results were got. The physicist set up his quadrant\r\nelectrometer after a good deal of trouble, but throughout the winter\r\nhad to struggle constantly with rime forming on the parts of his\r\napparatus exposed to the outer air. Good runs were being thus\r\ncontinually spoilt. The determination of the magnetic constants also\r\ntook up a good part of his time.\r\n\r\nBesides collecting _plankton_ the biologist was now able to put down\r\none or other of his dredges at more frequent intervals, always taking\r\ncare, however, not to exhaust his store of preserving material, which\r\nwas limited. The taking of water samples was established on a better\r\nsystem, so that the series should be about equally spaced out over the\r\nship’s course. The geologist suppressed all thought of rocks, though\r\noccasionally they were met with in bottom samples; his work became\r\nalmost entirely oceanographical, and included a study of the sea-ice,\r\nof the physiography of the sea floor as shown by daily soundings, and\r\nof the bottom deposits; besides this he helped the biologist in the\r\ntemperature and salinity observations.\r\n\r\nThe work undertaken and accomplished by each member was as wide as\r\npossible; but it was only in keeping with the spirit of the times that\r\nmore attention should be paid to work from which practical and economic\r\nresults were likely to accrue. The meteorologist had always in view the\r\neffect of Antarctic climate on the other southern continents, the\r\ngeologist looked on ice from a seaman’s point of view, and the\r\nbiologist not unwillingly put whales in the forefront of his programme.\r\nThe accounts which follow on these very practical points show how\r\nclosely scientific work in the Antarctica is in touch with, and helps\r\non the economic development of, the inhabited lands to the north.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA-ICE NOMENCLATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nBy J. M. WORDIE, M.A. (Cantab.), Lieut. R.F.A.\r\n\r\nDuring the voyage of the _Endurance_ it was soon noticed that the terms\r\nbeing used to describe different forms of ice were not always in\r\nagreement with those given in Markham’s and Mill’s glossary in “The\r\nAntarctic Manual,” 1901. It was the custom, of course, to follow\r\nimplicitly the terminology used by those of the party whose experience\r\nof ice dated back to Captain Scott’s first voyage, so that the terms\r\nused may be said to be common to all Antarctic voyages of the present\r\ncentury. The principal changes, therefore, in nomenclature must date\r\nfrom the last quarter of the nineteenth century, when there was no one\r\nto pass on the traditional usage from the last naval Arctic Expedition\r\nin 1875 to the _Discovery_ Expedition of 1901. On the latter ship\r\nMarkham’s and Mill’s glossary was, of course, used, but apparently not\r\nslavishly; founded, as far as sea-ice went, on Scoresby’s, made in\r\n1820, it might well have been adopted in its entirety, for no writer\r\ncould have carried more weight than Scoresby the younger, combining as\r\nhe did more than ten years’ whaling experience with high scientific\r\nattainments. Above all others he could be accepted both by practical\r\nseamen and also by students of ice forms.\r\n\r\nThat the old terms of Scoresby did not all survive the period of\r\nindifference to Polar work, in spite of Markham and Mill, is an\r\nindication either that their usefulness has ceased or that the original\r\nusage has changed once and for all. A restatement of terms is therefore\r\nnow necessary. Where possible the actual phrases of Scoresby and of his\r\nsuccessors, Markham and Mill, are still used. The principle adopted,\r\nhowever, is to give preference to the words actually used by the Polar\r\nseamen themselves.\r\n\r\nThe following authorities have been followed as closely as possible:\r\n\r\nW. Scoresby, Jun., “An Account of the Arctic Regions,” 1820, vol. i,\r\npp. 225–233, 238–241.\r\n\r\nC. R. Markham and H. R. Mill in “The Antarctic Manual,” 1901, pp,\r\nxiv–xvi.\r\n\r\nJ. Payer, “New Lands within the Arctic Circle,” 1876, vol. i, pp. 3–14.\r\n\r\nW. S. Bruce, “Polar Exploration” in Home University Library, c. 1911,\r\npp. 54–71.\r\n\r\nReference should also be made to the annual publication of the Danish\r\nMeteorological Institute showing the Arctic ice conditions of the\r\nprevious summer. This is published in both Danish and English, so that\r\nthe terms used there are bound to have a very wide acceptance; it is\r\nhoped, therefore, that they may be the means of preventing the\r\nAntarctic terminology following a different line of evolution; for but\r\nseldom is a seaman found nowadays who knows both Polar regions. On the\r\nDanish charts six different kinds of sea-ice are marked—namely,\r\nunbroken polar ice; land-floe; great ice-fields; tight pack-ice; open\r\nice; bay-ice and brash. With the exception of bay-ice, which is more\r\ngenerally known as young ice, all these terms pass current in the\r\nAntarctic.\r\n\r\n_Slush_ or _Sludge_. The initial stages in the freezing of sea-water,\r\nwhen its consistency becomes gluey or soupy. The term is also used (but\r\nnot commonly) for brash-ice still further broken down.\r\n\r\n_Pancake-ice_. Small circular floes with raised rims; due to the\r\nbreak-up in a gently ruffled sea of the newly formed ice into pieces\r\nwhich strike against each other, and so form turned-up edges.\r\n\r\n_Young Ice_. Applied to all unhummocked ice up to about a foot in\r\nthickness. Owing to the fibrous or platy structure, the floes crack\r\neasily, and where the ice is not over thick a ship under steam cuts a\r\npassage without much difficulty. Young ice may originate from the\r\ncoalescence of “pancakes,” where the water is slightly ruffled or else\r\nbe a sheet of “black ice,” covered maybe with “ice-flowers,” formed by\r\nthe freezing of a smooth sheet of sea-water.\r\n\r\nIn the Arctic it has been the custom to call this form of ice\r\n“bay-ice”; in the Antarctic, however, the latter term is wrongly used\r\nfor land-floes (fast-ice, etc.), and has been so misapplied\r\nconsistently for fifteen years. The term bay-ice should possibly,\r\ntherefore, be dropped altogether, especially since, even in the Arctic,\r\nits meaning is not altogether a rigid one, as it may denote firstly the\r\ngluey “slush,” which forms when sea-water freezes, and secondly the\r\nfirm level sheet ultimately produced.\r\n\r\n_Land floes_. Heavy but not necessarily hummocked ice, with generally a\r\ndeep snow covering, which has remained held up in the position of\r\ngrowth by the enclosing nature of some feature of the coast, or by\r\ngrounded bergs throughout the summer season when most of the ice breaks\r\nout. Its thickness is, therefore, above the average. Has been called at\r\nvarious times “fast-ice,” “coast-ice,” “land-ice,” “bay-ice” by\r\nShackleton and David and the Charcot Expedition; and possibly what\r\nDrygalski calls _Schelfeis_ is not very different.\r\n\r\n_Floe_. An area of ice, level or hummocked, whose limits are within\r\nsight. Includes all sizes between brash on the one hand and fields on\r\nthe other. “Light-floes” are between one and two feet in thickness\r\n(anything thinner being “young-ice”). Those exceeding two feet in\r\nthickness are termed “heavy floes,” being generally hummocked, and in\r\nthe Antarctic, at any rate, covered by fairly deep snow.\r\n\r\n_Field_. A sheet of ice of such extent that its limits cannot be seen\r\nfrom the masthead.\r\n\r\n_Hummocking_. Includes all the processes of pressure formation whereby\r\nlevel young ice becomes broken up and built up into\r\n\r\n_Hummocky Floes_. The most suitable term for what has also been called\r\n“old pack” and “screwed pack” by David and _Scholleneis_ by German\r\nwriters. In contrast to young ice, the structure is no longer fibrous,\r\nbut becomes spotted or bubbly, a certain percentage of salt drains\r\naway, and the ice becomes almost translucent.\r\n\r\n_The Pack_ is a term very often used in a wide sense to include any\r\narea of sea-ice, no matter what form it takes or how disposed. The\r\nFrench term is _banquise de derive_.\r\n\r\n_Pack-ice_. A more restricted use than the above, to include hummocky\r\nfloes or close areas of young ice and light floes. Pack-ice is “close”\r\nor “tight” if the floes constituting it are in contact; “open” if, for\r\nthe most part, they do not touch. In both cases it hinders, but does\r\nnot necessarily check, navigation; the contrary holds for\r\n\r\n_Drift-ice_. Loose open ice, where the area of water exceeds that of\r\nice. Generally drift-ice is within reach of the swell, and is a stage\r\nin the breaking down of pack-ice, the size of the floes being much\r\nsmaller than in the latter. (Scoresby’s use of the term drift-ice for\r\npieces of ice intermediate in size between floes and brash has,\r\nhowever, quite died out). The Antarctic or Arctic pack usually has a\r\ngirdle or fringe of drift-ice.\r\n\r\n_Brash_. Small fragments and roundish nodules; the wreck of other kinds\r\nof ice.\r\n\r\n_Bergy Bits_. Pieces, about the size of a cottage, of glacier-ice or of\r\nhummocky pack washed clear of snow.\r\n\r\n_Growlers_. Still smaller pieces of sea-ice than the above, greenish in\r\ncolour, and barely showing above water-level.\r\n\r\n_Crack_. Any sort of fracture or rift in the sea-ice covering.\r\n\r\n_Lead_ or _Lane_. Where a crack opens out to such a width as to be\r\nnavigable. In the Antarctic it is customary to speak of these as leads,\r\neven when frozen over to constitute areas of young ice.\r\n\r\n_Pools_. Any enclosed water areas in the pack, where length and breadth\r\nare about equal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETEOROLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nBy L. D. A. HUSSEY, B.Sc., (Lond.), Capt. R.G.A.\r\n\r\nThe meteorological results of the Expedition, when properly worked out\r\nand correlated with those from other stations in the southern\r\nhemisphere, will be extremely valuable, both for their bearing on the\r\nscience of meteorology in general, and for their practical and economic\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nSouth America is, perhaps, more intimately concerned than any other\r\ncountry, but Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa are all affected\r\nby the weather conditions of the Antarctic. Researches are now being\r\ncarried on which tend to show that the meteorology of the two\r\nhemispheres is more interdependent than was hitherto believed, so that\r\na meteorological disturbance in one part of the world makes its\r\npresence felt, more or less remotely perhaps, all over the world.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that a complete knowledge of the weather\r\nconditions in any part of the world, which it is understood carries\r\nwith it the ability to make correct forecasts, can never be obtained\r\nunless the weather conditions in every other part are known. This makes\r\nthe need for purely scientific Polar Expeditions so imperative, since\r\nour present knowledge of Arctic and Antarctic meteorology is very\r\nmeagre, and to a certain extent unsystematic. What is wanted is a chain\r\nof observing stations well equipped with instruments and trained\r\nobservers stretching across the Antarctic Continent. A series of\r\nexploring ships could supplement these observations with others made by\r\nthem while cruising in the Antarctic Seas. It would pay to do this,\r\neven for the benefit accruing to farmers, sailors, and others who are\r\nso dependent on the weather.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the value of a knowledge of Antarctic weather\r\nconditions, it may be mentioned that, as the result of observations and\r\nresearches carried out at the South Orkneys—a group of sub-Antarctic\r\nislands at the entrance to the Weddell Sea—it has been found that a\r\ncold winter in that sea is a sure precursor of a drought over the maize\r\nand cereal bearing area of Argentina three and a half years later. To\r\nthe farmers, the value of this knowledge so far in advance is enormous,\r\nand since England has some three hundred million pounds sterling\r\ninvested in Argentine interests, Antarctic Expeditions have proved, and\r\nwill prove, their worth even from a purely commercial point of view.\r\n\r\nI have given just this one instance to satisfy those who question the\r\nutility of Polar Expeditions, but many more could be cited.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was apparent that no landing could be made, and that we\r\nshould have to spend a winter in the ship drifting round with the pack,\r\ninstruments were set up and observations taken just as if we had been\r\nashore.\r\n\r\nA meteorological screen or box was erected on a platform over the\r\nstern, right away from the living quarters, and in it were placed the\r\nmaximum and minimum thermometers, the recording barograph, and\r\nthermograph—an instrument which writes every variation of the\r\ntemperature and pressure on a sheet of paper on a revolving drum—and\r\nthe standard thermometer, a very carefully manufactured thermometer,\r\nwith all its errors determined and tabulated. The other thermometers\r\nwere all checked from this one. On top of the screen a Robinson’s\r\nanemometer was screwed. This consisted of an upright rod, to the top of\r\nwhich were pivoted four arms free to revolve in a plane at right angles\r\nto it. At the end of these arms hemispherical cups were screwed. These\r\nwere caught by the wind and the arms revolved at a speed varying with\r\nthe force of the wind. The speed of the wind could be read off on a\r\ndial below the arms.\r\n\r\nIn addition there was an instrument called a Dines anemometer which\r\nsupplied interesting tracings of the force, duration, and direction of\r\nthe wind. There was an added advantage in the fact that the drum on\r\nwhich these results were recorded was comfortably housed down below, so\r\nthat one could sit in a comparatively warm room and follow all the\r\nvarying phases of the blizzard which was raging without. The barometer\r\nused was of the Kew Standard pattern. When the ship was crushed, all\r\nthe monthly records were saved, but the detailed tracings, which had\r\nbeen packed up in the hold, were lost. Though interesting they were not\r\nreally essential. Continuous observations were made during the long\r\ndrift on the floe and while on Elephant Island the temperature was\r\ntaken at midday each day as long as the thermometers lasted. The\r\nmortality amongst these instruments, especially those which were tied\r\nto string and swung round, was very high.\r\n\r\nA few extracts from the observations taken during 1915—the series for\r\nthat year being practically complete—may be of interest. January was\r\ndull and overcast, only 7 per cent. of the observations recording a\r\nclear blue sky, 71 per cent. being completely overcast.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of clear sky increased steadily up till June and July,\r\nthese months showing respectively 42 per cent. and 45.7 per cent. In\r\nAugust 40 per cent. of the observations were clear sky, while September\r\nshowed a sudden drop to 27 per cent. October weather was much the same,\r\nand November was practically overcast the whole time, clear sky showing\r\nat only 8 per cent. of the observations. In December the sky was\r\ncompletely overcast for nearly 90 per cent. of the time.\r\n\r\nTemperatures on the whole were fairly high, though a sudden unexpected\r\ndrop in February, after a series of heavy north-easterly gales, caused\r\nthe ship to be frozen in, and effectually put an end to any hopes of\r\nlanding that year. The lowest temperature experienced was in July, when\r\n–35° Fahr., _i.e._ 67° below freezing, was reached. Fortunately, as the\r\nsea was one mass of consolidated pack, the air was dry, and many days\r\nof fine bright sunshine occurred. Later on, as the pack drifted\r\nnorthwards and broke up, wide lanes of water were formed, causing fogs\r\nand mist and dull overcast weather generally. In short, it may be said\r\nthat in the Weddell Sea the best weather comes in winter. Unfortunately\r\nduring that season the sun also disappears, so that one cannot enjoy it\r\nas much as one would like.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, too, southerly winds brought fine clear weather, with marked\r\nfall in the temperature, and those from the north were accompanied by\r\nmist, fog, and overcast skies, with comparatively high temperatures. In\r\nthe Antarctic a temperature of 30°, _i.e._ 2° _below_ freezing, is\r\nconsidered unbearably hot.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty that was experienced was due to the\r\naccumulation of rime on the instruments. In low temperatures everything\r\nbecame covered with ice-crystals, deposited from the air, which\r\neventually grew into huge blocks. Sometimes these blocks became\r\ndislodged and fell, making it dangerous to walk along the decks. The\r\nrime collected on the thermometers, the glass bowl of the sunshine\r\nrecorder, and the bearings of the anemometer, necessitating the\r\nfrequent use of a brush to remove it, and sometimes effectively\r\npreventing the instruments from recording at all.\r\n\r\nOne of our worst blizzards occurred on August 1, 1915, which was, for\r\nthe ship, the beginning of the end. It lasted for four days, with\r\ncloudy and overcast weather for the three following days, and from that\r\ntime onwards we enjoyed very little sun.\r\n\r\nThe weather that we experienced on Elephant Island can only be\r\ndescribed as appalling. Situated as we were at the mouth of a gully,\r\ndown which a huge glacier was slowly moving, with the open sea in front\r\nand to the left, and towering, snow-covered mountains on our right, the\r\nair was hardly ever free from snowdrift, and the winds increased to\r\nterrific violence through being forced over the glacier and through the\r\nnarrow gully. Huge blocks of ice were hurled about like pebbles, and\r\ncases of clothing and cooking utensils were whisked out of our hands\r\nand carried away to sea. For the first fortnight after our landing\r\nthere, the gale blew, at times, at over one hundred miles an hour.\r\nFortunately it never again quite reached that intensity, but on several\r\noccasions violent squalls made us very fearful for the safety of our\r\nhut. The island was almost continuously covered with a pall of fog and\r\nsnow, clear weather obtaining occasionally when pack-ice surrounded us.\r\nFortunately a series of south-westerly gales had blown all the ice away\r\nto the north-east two days before the rescue ship arrived, leaving a\r\ncomparatively clear sea for her to approach the island.\r\n\r\nBeing one solitary moving station in the vast expanse of the Weddell\r\nSea, with no knowledge of what was happening anywhere around us,\r\nforecasting was very difficult and at times impossible.\r\n\r\nGreat assistance in this direction was afforded by copies of Mr. R. C.\r\nMossmann’s researches and papers on Antarctic meteorology, which he\r\nkindly supplied to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “The Rookery”]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Anemometer covered with Rime]\r\n\r\n\r\nI have tried to make this very brief account of the meteorological side\r\nof the Expedition rather more “popular” than scientific, since the\r\npublication and scientific discussion of the observations will be\r\ncarried out elsewhere; but if, while showing the difficulties under\r\nwhich we had to work, it emphasizes the value of Antarctic Expeditions\r\nfrom a purely utilitarian point of view, and the need for further\r\ncontinuous research into the conditions obtaining in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the Pole, it will have achieved its object.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICS\r\n\r\n\r\nBy R. W. JAMES, M.A. (Cantab.), B.Sc. (Lond.), Capt. R.E.\r\n\r\nOwing to the continued drift of the ship with the ice, the programme of\r\nphysical observations originally made out had to be considerably\r\nmodified. It had been intended to set up recording magnetic instruments\r\nat the base, and to take a continuous series of records throughout the\r\nwhole period of residence there, absolute measurements of the earth’s\r\nhorizontal magnetic force, of the dip and declination being taken at\r\nfrequent intervals for purposes of calibration. With the ice\r\ncontinually drifting, and the possibility of the floe cracking at any\r\ntime, it proved impracticable to set up the recording instruments, and\r\nthe magnetic observations were confined to a series of absolute\r\nmeasurements taken whenever opportunity occurred. These measurements,\r\nowing to the drift of the ship, extend over a considerable distance,\r\nand give a chain of values along a line stretching, roughly from 77° S.\r\nlat. to 69° S. lat. This is not the place to give the actual results;\r\nit is quite enough to state that, as might have been expected from the\r\nposition of the magnetic pole, the values obtained correspond to a\r\ncomparatively low magnetic latitude, the value of the dip ranging from\r\n63° to 68°.\r\n\r\nSo far as possible, continuous records of the electric potential\r\ngradient in the atmosphere were taken, a form of quadrant electrometer\r\nwith a boom and ink recorder, made by the Cambridge Scientific\r\nInstrument Company, being employed. Here again, the somewhat peculiar\r\nconditions made work difficult, as the instrument was very susceptible\r\nto small changes of level, such as occurred from time to time owing to\r\nthe pressure of the ice on the ship. An ionium collector, for which the\r\nradioactive material was kindly supplied by Mr. F. H. Glew, was used.\r\nThe chief difficulty to contend with was the constant formation of\r\nthick deposits of rime, which either grew over the insulation and\r\nspoiled it, or covered up the collector so that it could no longer act.\r\nNevertheless, a considerable number of good records were obtained,\r\nwhich have not yet been properly worked out. Conditions during the\r\nExpedition were very favourable for observations on the physical\r\nproperties and natural history of sea-ice, and a considerable number of\r\nresults were obtained, which are, however, discussed elsewhere, mention\r\nof them being made here since they really come under the heading of\r\nphysics.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these main lines of work, many observations of a\r\nmiscellaneous character were made, including those on the occurrence\r\nand nature of parhelia or “mock suns,” which were very common, and\r\ngenerally finely developed, and observations of the auroral displays,\r\nwhich were few and rather poor owing to the comparatively low magnetic\r\nlatitude. Since most of the observations made are of little value\r\nwithout a knowledge of the place where they were made, and since a very\r\ncomplete set of soundings were also taken, the daily determination of\r\nthe ship’s position was a matter of some importance. The drift of the\r\nship throws considerable light on at least one geographical problem,\r\nthat of the existence of Morrell Land. The remainder of this appendix\r\nwill therefore be devoted to a discussion of the methods used to\r\ndetermine the positions of the ship from day to day.\r\n\r\nThe latitude and longitude were determined astronomically every day\r\nwhen the sun or stars were visible, the position thus determined\r\nserving as the fixed points between which the position on days when the\r\nsky was overcast could be interpolated by the process known as “dead\r\nreckoning,” that is to say, by estimating the speed and course of the\r\nship, taking into account the various causes affecting it. The sky was\r\noften overcast for several days at a stretch, and it was worth while to\r\ntake a certain amount of care in the matter. Captain Worsley\r\nconstructed an apparatus which gave a good idea of the direction of\r\ndrift at any time. This consisted of an iron rod, which passed through\r\nan iron tube, frozen vertically into the ice, into the water below. At\r\nthe lower end of the rod, in the water, was a vane. The rod being free\r\nto turn, the vane took up the direction of the current, the direction\r\nbeing shown by an indicator attached to the top of the rod. The\r\ndirection shown depended, of course, on the drift of the ice relative\r\nto the water, and did not take into account any actual current which\r\nmay have been carrying the ice with it, but the true current seems\r\nnever to have been large, and the direction of the vane probably gave\r\nfairly accurately the direction of the drift of the ice. No exact idea\r\nof the rate of drift could be obtained from the apparatus, although one\r\ncould get an estimate of it by displacing the vane from its position of\r\nrest and noticing how quickly it returned to it, the speed of return\r\nbeing greater the more rapid the drift. Another means of estimating the\r\nspeed and direction of the drift was from the trend of the wire when a\r\nsounding was being taken. The rate and direction of drift appeared to\r\ndepend almost entirely on the wind-velocity and direction at the time.\r\nIf any true current-effect existed, it is not obvious from a rough\r\ncomparison of the drift with the prevailing wind, but a closer\r\ninvestigation of the figures may show some outstanding effect due to\r\ncurrent.[1] The drift was always to the left of the actual\r\nwind-direction. This effect is due to the rotation of the earth, a\r\ncorresponding deviation to the right of the wind direction being noted\r\nby Nansen during the drift of the _Fram_. A change in the direction of\r\nthe wind was often preceded by some hours by a change in the reading of\r\nthe drift vane. This is no doubt due to the ice to windward being set\r\nin motion, the resulting disturbance travelling through the ice more\r\nrapidly than the approaching wind.\r\n\r\n [1] Cf. “Scientific results of Norwegian North Polar Expedition,\r\n 1893–96,” vol. iii, p. 357.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the astronomical observations either the sextant or a theodolite\r\nwas used. The theodolite employed was a light 3´´ Vernier instrument by\r\nCarey Porter, intended for sledging work. This instrument was fairly\r\nsatisfactory, although possibly rigidity had been sacrificed to\r\nlightness to rather too great an extent. Another point which appears\r\nworth mentioning is the following: The foot-screws were of brass, the\r\ntribrach, into which they fitted, was made of aluminium for the sake of\r\nlightness. The two metals have a different coefficient of expansion,\r\nand while the feet fitted the tribrach at ordinary temperatures, they\r\nwere quite loose at temperatures in the region of 20° Fahr. below zero.\r\nIn any instrument designed for use at low temperatures, care should be\r\ntaken that parts which have to fit together are made of the same\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nFor determining the position in drifting pack-ice, the theodolite\r\nproved to be a more generally useful instrument than the sextant. The\r\nice-floes are quite steady in really thick pack-ice, and the theodolite\r\ncan be set up and levelled as well as on dry land. The observations,\r\nboth for latitude and longitude, consist in measuring altitude of the\r\nsun or of a star. The chief uncertainty in this measurement is that\r\nintroduced by the refraction of light by the air. At very low\r\ntemperatures, the correction to be applied on this account is\r\nuncertain, and, if possible, observations should always be made in\r\npairs with a north star and a south star for a latitude, and an east\r\nstar and a west star for a longitude. The refraction error will then\r\nusually mean out. This error affects observations both with the\r\ntheodolite and the sextant, but in the case of the sextant another\r\ncause of error occurs. In using the sextant, the angle between the\r\nheavenly body and the visible horizon is measured directly. Even in\r\ndense pack-ice, if the observations are taken from the deck of the ship\r\nor from a hummock or a low berg, the apparent horizon is usually sharp\r\nenough for the purpose. In very cold weather, however, and particularly\r\nif there are open leads and pools between the observer and the horizon,\r\nthere is frequently a great deal of mirage, and the visible horizon may\r\nbe miraged up several minutes. This will reduce the altitude observed,\r\nand corrections on this account are practically impossible to apply.\r\nThis error may be counterbalanced to some extent by pairing\r\nobservations as described above, but it by no means follows that the\r\nmirage effect will be the same in the two directions. Then again,\r\nduring the summer months, no stars will be visible, and observations\r\nfor latitude will have to depend on a single noon sight of the sun. If\r\nthe sun is visible at midnight its altitude will be too low for\r\naccurate observations, and in any case atmospheric conditions will be\r\nquite different from those prevailing at noon. In the Antarctic,\r\ntherefore, conditions are peculiarly difficult for getting really\r\naccurate observations, and it is necessary to reduce the probability of\r\nerror in a single observation as much as possible. When possible,\r\nobservations of the altitude of a star or of the sun should be taken\r\nwith the theodolite, since the altitude is referred to the spirit-level\r\nof the instrument, and is independent of any apparent horizon. During\r\nthe drift of the _Endurance_ both means of observation were generally\r\nemployed. A comparison of the results showed an agreement between\r\nsextant and theodolite, within the errors of the instrument if the\r\ntemperature was above about 20° Fahr. At lower temperatures there were\r\nfrequently discrepancies which could generally be attributed to the\r\nmirage effects described above.\r\n\r\nAs the _Endurance_ was carried by the ice-drift well to the west of the\r\nWeddell Sea, towards the position of the supposed Morrell Land, the\r\naccurate determination of longitude became a matter of moment in view\r\nof the controversy as to the existence of this land. During a long\r\nvoyage latitude can always be determined with about the same accuracy,\r\nthe accuracy merely depending on the closeness with which altitudes can\r\nbe measured. In the case of longitude matters are rather different. The\r\nusual method employed consists in the determination of the local time\r\nby astronomical observations, and the comparison of this time with\r\nGreenwich time, as shown by the ship’s chronometer, an accurate\r\nknowledge of the errors and rate of the chronometer being required.\r\nDuring the voyage of the _Endurance_ about fifteen months elapsed\r\nduring which no check on the chronometers could be obtained by the\r\nobservation of known land, and had no other check been applied there\r\nwould have been the probability of large errors in the longitudes. For\r\nthe purpose of checking the chronometers a number of observations of\r\noccultations were observed during the winter of 1915. An occultation is\r\nreally the eclipse of a star by the moon. A number of such eclipses\r\noccur monthly, and are tabulated in the “Nautical Almanac.” From the\r\ndata given there it is possible to compute the Greenwich time at which\r\nthe phenomenon ought to occur for an observer situated at any place on\r\nthe earth, provided his position is known within a few miles, which\r\nwill always be the case. The time of disappearance of the star by the\r\nchronometer to be corrected is noted. The actual Greenwich time of the\r\noccurrence is calculated, and the error of the chronometer is thus\r\ndetermined. With ordinary care the chronometer error can be determined\r\nin this way to within a few seconds, which is accurate enough for\r\npurposes of navigation. The principal difficulties of this method lie\r\nin the fact that comparatively few occultations occur, and those which\r\ndo occur are usually of stars of the fifth magnitude or lower. In the\r\nAntarctic, conditions for observing occultation are rather favourable\r\nduring the winter, since, fifth-magnitude stars can be seen with a\r\nsmall telescope at any time during the twenty-four hours if the sky is\r\nclear, and the moon is also often above the horizon for a large\r\nfraction of the time. In the summer, however, the method is quite\r\nimpossible, since, for some months, stars are not to be seen.\r\n\r\nNo chronometer check could be applied until June 1915. On June 24 a\r\nseries of four occultations were observed; and the results of the\r\nobservations showed an error in longitude of a whole degree. In July,\r\nAugust, and September further occultations were observed, and a fairly\r\nreliable rate was worked out for the chronometers and watches. After\r\nthe crushing of the ship on October 27, 1915, no further occultations\r\nwere observed, but the calculated rates for the watches were employed,\r\nand the longitude deduced, using these rates on March 23, 1916, was\r\nonly about 10´ of arc in error, judging by the observations of\r\nJoinville Land made on that day. It is thus fairly certain that no\r\nlarge error can have been made in the determination of the position of\r\nthe _Endurance_ at any time during the drift, and her course can be\r\ntaken as known with greater certainty than is usually the case in a\r\nvoyage of such length.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH ATLANTIC WHALES AND WHALING\r\n\r\n\r\nBy ROBERT S. CLARK, M.A., B.Sc., Lieut. R.N.V.R.\r\n\r\nModern whaling methods were introduced into sub-Antarctic seas in 1904,\r\nand operations commenced in the following year at South Georgia. So\r\nsuccessful was the initial venture that several companies were floated,\r\nand the fishing area was extended to the South Shetlands, the South\r\nOrkneys, and as far as 67° S along the western coast of Graham Land.\r\nThis area lies within the Dependencies of the Falkland Islands, and is\r\nunder the control of the British Government, and its geographical\r\nposition offers exceptional opportunities for the successful\r\nprosecution of the industry by providing a sufficient number of safe\r\nanchorages and widely separated islands, where shore stations have been\r\nestablished. The Dependencies of the Falkland Islands lie roughly\r\nwithin latitude 50° and 65° S. and longitude 25° and 70° W., and\r\ninclude the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, South Sandwich, South\r\nOrkney, and South Shetland Islands, and part of Graham Land.\r\n\r\nThe industry is prosperous, and the products always find a ready\r\nmarket. In this sub-Antarctic area alone, the resulting products more\r\nthan doubled the world’s supply. The total value of the Falkland Island\r\nDependencies in 1913 amounted to £1,252,432, in 1914 to £1,300,978, in\r\n1915 to £1,333,401, and in 1916 to £1,774,570. This has resulted\r\nchiefly from the marketing of whale oil and the by-product, guano, and\r\nrepresents for each total a season’s capture of several thousand\r\nwhales. In 1916, the number of whales captured in this area was 11,860,\r\nwhich included 6000 for South Georgia alone. Whale oil, which is now\r\nthe product of most economic value in the whaling industry, is produced\r\nin four grades (some companies adding a fifth). These are Nos. 0, I,\r\nII, III, IV, which in 1913 sold at £24, £22, £20, and £18 respectively\r\nper ton, net weight, barrels included (there are six barrels to a ton).\r\nThe 1919 prices have increased to\r\n\r\n£72 10s. per ton (barrels included) less 2½ per cent.\r\n£68 per ton (barrels included) less 2½ per cent.\r\n£65   ”    ”        ”          ”          ”          ”      ”\r\n£63   ”    ”        ”          ”          ”          ”      ”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhale oil can be readily transformed into glycerine: it is used in the\r\nmanufacture of soap, and quite recently, both in this country and in\r\nNorway, it has been refined by means of a simple hardening process into\r\na highly palatable and nutritious margarine. Wartime conditions\r\nemphasized the importance of the whale oil, and fortunately the supply\r\nwas fairly constant for the production of the enormous quantities of\r\nglycerine required by the country in the manufacture of explosives. In\r\nrelation to the food supply, it was no less important in saving the\r\ncountry from a “fat” famine, when the country was confronted with the\r\nshortage of vegetable and other animal oils. The production of guano,\r\nbone-meal, and flesh-meal may pay off the running expenses of a\r\nwhaling-station, but their value lies, perhaps, more in their\r\nindividual properties. Flesh-meal makes up into cattle-cake, which\r\nforms an excellent fattening food for cattle, while bone-meal and guano\r\nare very effective fertilizers. Guano is the meat—generally the residue\r\nof distillation—which goes through a process of drying and\r\ndisintegration, and is mixed with the crushed bone in the proportion of\r\ntwo parts flesh to one part bone. This is done chiefly at the shore\r\nstations, and, to a less extent on floating factories, though so far on\r\nthe latter it has not proved very profitable. Whale flesh, though\r\nslightly greasy perhaps and of strong flavour, is quite palatable, and\r\nat South Georgia, it made a welcome addition to our bill of fare—the\r\nflesh of the hump back being used. A large supply of whale flesh was\r\n“shipped” as food for the dogs on the journey South, and this was eaten\r\nravenously. It is interesting to note also the successful rearing of\r\npigs at South Georgia—chiefly, if not entirely, on the whale products.\r\nThe whalebone or baleen plates, which at one time formed the most\r\nvaluable article of the Arctic fishery, may here be regarded as of\r\nsecondary importance. The baleen plates of the southern right whale\r\nreach only a length of about 7 ft., and have been valued at £750 per\r\nton, but the number of these whales captured is very small indeed. In\r\nthe case of the other whalebone whales, the baleen plates are much\r\nsmaller and of inferior quality—the baleen of the sei whale probably\r\nexcepted, and this only makes about £85 per ton, Sperm whales have been\r\ntaken at South Georgia and the South Shetlands, but never in any\r\nquantity, being more numerous in warmer areas. The products and their\r\nvalue are too well known to be repeated.\r\n\r\nThe _Endurance_ reached South Georgia on November 5, 1914, and anchored\r\nin King Edward Cove, Cumberland Bay, off Grytviken, the shore station\r\nof the Argentina Pesca Company. During the month’s stay at the island a\r\nconsiderable amount of time was devoted to a study of the whales and\r\nthe whaling industry, in the intervals of the general routine of\r\nexpedition work, and simultaneously with other studies on the general\r\nlife of this interesting sub-Antarctic island. Visits were made to six\r\nof the seven existing stations, observations were made on the whales\r\nlanded, and useful insight was gathered as to the general working of\r\nthe industry.\r\n\r\nFrom South Georgia the track of the _Endurance_ lay in a direct line to\r\nthe South Sandwich Group, between Saunders and Candlemas Islands. Then\r\nsouth-easterly and southerly courses were steered to the Coats’ Land\r\nbarrier, along which we steamed for a few hundred miles until forced\r\nwestward, when we were unfortunately held up in about lat. 76° 34´ S.\r\nand long. 37° 30´ W. on January 19, 1915, by enormous masses of heavy\r\npack-ice. The ship drifted to lat. 76° 59´ S., long. 37° 47´ W. on\r\nMarch 19, 1915, and then west and north until crushed in lat. 69° 5´ S.\r\nand long. 51° 30´ W. on October 26, 1915. We continued drifting\r\ngradually north, afloat on ice-floes, past Graham Land and Joinville\r\nIsland, and finally took to the boats on April 9, 1916, and reached\r\nElephant Island on April 15. The Falkland Island Dependencies were thus\r\npractically circumnavigated, and it may be interesting to compare the\r\nrecords of whales seen in the region outside and to the south of this\r\narea with the records and the percentage of each species captured in\r\nthe intensive fishing area.\r\n\r\nThe most productive part of the South Atlantic lies south of latitude\r\n50° S., where active operations extend to and even beyond the Antarctic\r\ncircle. It appears to be the general rule in Antarctic waters that\r\nwhales are more numerous the closer the association with ice\r\nconditions, and there seems to be reasonable grounds for supposing that\r\nthis may explain the comparatively few whales sighted by Expeditions\r\nwhich have explored the more northerly and more open seas, while the\r\nwhalers themselves have even asserted that their poor seasons have\r\nnearly always coincided with the absence of ice, or with poor ice\r\nconditions. At all events, those Expeditions which have penetrated far\r\nsouth and well into the pack-ice have, without exception, reported the\r\npresence of whales in large numbers, even in the farthest south\r\nlatitudes, so that our knowledge of the occurrence of whales in the\r\nAntarctic has been largely derived from these Expeditions, whose main\r\nobject was either the discovery of new land or the Pole itself. The\r\nlargest number of Antarctic Expeditions has concentrated on the two\r\nareas of the South Atlantic and the Ross Sea, and the records of the\r\noccurrences of whales have, in consequence, been concentrated in these\r\ntwo localities. In the intervening areas, however, Expeditions, notably\r\nthe _Belgica_ on the western side and the _Gauss_ on the eastern side\r\nof the Antarctic continent, have reported whales in moderately large\r\nnumbers, so that the stock is by no means confined to the two areas\r\nabove mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe effective fishing area may be assumed to lie within a radius of a\r\nhundred miles from each shore station and floating-factory anchorage,\r\nand a rough estimate of all the Falkland stations works out at 160,000\r\nsquare miles. The total for the whole Falkland area is about 2,000,000\r\nsquare miles, which is roughly less than a sixth of the total Antarctic\r\nsea area. The question then arises as to how far the “catch percentage”\r\nduring the short fishing season affects the total stock, but so far one\r\ncan only conjecture as to the actual results from a comparison of the\r\nnumbers seen, chiefly by scientific and other Expeditions, in areas\r\noutside the intensive fishing area with the numbers and percentage of\r\neach species captured in the intensive fishing area. Sufficient\r\nevidence, however, seems to point quite definitely to one species—the\r\nhumpback—being in danger of extermination, but the blue and fin\r\nwhales—the other two species of rorquals which form the bulk of the\r\ncaptures—appear to be as frequent now as they have ever been.\r\n\r\nThe whales captured at the various whaling-stations of the Falkland\r\narea are confined largely to three species—blue whale (_Balænoptera\r\nmusculus_), fin whale (_Balænoptera physalis_), and humpback\r\n(_Megaptera nodosa_); sperm whales (_Physeter catodon_) and right\r\nwhales (_Balæna glacialis_) being only occasional and rare captures,\r\nwhile the sei whale (_Balænoptera borealis_) appeared in the captures\r\nat South Georgia in 1913, and now forms a large percentage of the\r\ncaptures at the Falkland Islands. During the earlier years of whaling\r\nat South Georgia, and up to the fishing season 1910–11, humpbacks\r\nformed practically the total catch. In 1912–13 the following were the\r\npercentages for the three rorquals in the captures at South Georgia and\r\nSouth Shetlands:\r\n\r\nHumpback 38 per cent., fin whale 36 per cent., blue whale 20 per cent.\r\nOf late years the percentages have altered considerably, blue whales\r\nand fin whales predominating, humpbacks decreasing rapidly. In 1915,\r\nthe South Georgia Whaling Company (Messrs. Salvesen, Leith) captured\r\n1085 whales, consisting of 15 per cent. humpback, 25 per cent. fin\r\nwhales, 58 per cent. blue whales, and 2 right whales. In the same year\r\nthe captures of three companies at the South Shetlands gave 1512\r\nwhales, and the percentages worked out at 12 per cent. humpbacks, 42\r\nper cent. fin whales, and 45 per cent. blue whales. In 1919, the\r\nSouthern Whaling and Sealing Company captured (at Stromness, South\r\nGeorgia) 529 whales, of which 2 per cent. were humpbacks, 51 per cent.\r\nfin whales, and 45 per cent. blue whales. These captures do not\r\nrepresent the total catch, but are sufficiently reliable to show how\r\nthe species are affected. The reduction in numbers of the humpback is\r\nvery noticeable, and even allowing for the possible increase in size of\r\ngear for the capture of the larger and more lucrative blue and fin\r\nwhales, there is sufficient evidence to warrant the fears that the\r\nhumpback stock is threatened with extinction.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate northern areas—in the region from latitude 50° S.\r\nnorthward to the equator, which is regarded as next in importance\r\nquantitatively to the sub-Antarctic, though nothing like being so\r\nproductive, the captures are useful for a comparative study in\r\ndistribution. At Saldanha Bay, Cape Colony, in 1912, 131 whales were\r\ncaptured and the percentages were as follows: 35 per cent. humpback, 13\r\nper cent. fin whale, 4 per cent. blue whale, 46 per cent. sei whale,\r\nwhile nearer the equator, at Port Alexander, the total capture was 322\r\nwhales, and the percentages gave 98 per cent. humpback, and only 2\r\ncaptures each of fin and sei whales. In 1914, at South Africa (chiefly\r\nSaldanha Bay and Durban), out of a total of 839 whales 60 per cent.\r\nwere humpback, 25 per cent. fin whales, and 13 per cent. blue whales.\r\nIn 1916, out of a total of 853 whales 10 per cent. were humpback, 13\r\nper cent. fin whales, 6 per cent. blue whales, 68 per cent. sperm\r\nwhales, and 1 per cent. sei whales. In Chilian waters, in 1916, a total\r\nof 327 whales gave 31 per cent. humpbacks, 24 per cent. fin whales, 26\r\nper cent. blue whales, 12 per cent. sperm whales, and 5 right whales.\r\nThere seems then to be a definite interrelation between the two areas.\r\nThe same species of whales are captured, and the periods of capture\r\nalternate with perfect regularity, the fishing season occurring from\r\nthe end of November to April in the sub-Antarctic and from May to\r\nNovember in the sub-tropics. A few of the companies, however, carry on\r\noperations to a limited extent at South Georgia and at the Falkland\r\nislands during the southern winter, but the fishing is by no means a\r\nprofitable undertaking, though proving the presence of whales in this\r\narea during the winter months.\r\n\r\nThe migrations of whales are influenced by two causes:\r\n\r\n(1) The distribution of their food-supply;\r\n(2) The position of their breeding-grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Antarctic, during the summer months, there is present in the sea\r\nan abundance of plant and animal life, and whales which feed on the\r\nsmall _plankton_ organisms are correspondingly numerous, but in winter\r\nthis state of things is reversed, and whales are poorly represented or\r\nabsent, at least in the higher latitudes. During the drift of the\r\n_Endurance_ samples of _plankton_ were taken almost daily during an\r\nAntarctic summer and winter. From December to March, a few minutes haul\r\nof a tow-net at the surface was sufficient to choke up the meshes with\r\nthe plant and animal life, but this abundance of surface life broke off\r\nabruptly in April, and subsequent hauls contained very small organisms\r\nuntil the return of daylight and the opening up of the pack-ice. The\r\nlower water strata, down to about 100 fathoms, were only a little more\r\nproductive, and _Euphausiæ_ were taken in the hauls—though sparingly.\r\nDuring the winter spent at Elephant Island, our total catch of gentoo\r\npenguins amounted to 1436 for the period April 15 to August 30, 1916.\r\nAll these birds were cut up, the livers and hearts were extracted for\r\nfood, and the skins were used as fuel. At the same time the stomachs\r\nwere invariably examined, and a record kept of the contents. The\r\nlargest proportion of these contained the small crustacean _Euphausia_,\r\nand this generally to the exclusion of other forms. Occasionally,\r\nhowever, small fish were recorded. The quantity of _Euphausiæ_ present\r\nin most of the stomachs was enormous for the size of the birds. These\r\npenguins were migrating, and came ashore only when the bays were clear\r\nof ice, as there were several periods of fourteen consecutive days when\r\nthe bays and the surrounding sea were covered over with a thick compact\r\nmass of ice-floes, and then penguins were entirely absent.\r\n_Euphausiæ_, then, seem to be present in sufficient quantity in\r\ncertain, if not in all, sub-Antarctic waters during the southern\r\nwinter. We may assume then that the migration to the south, during the\r\nAntarctic summer, is definitely in search of food. Observations have\r\nproved the existence of a northern migration, and it seems highly\r\nimprobable that this should also be in search of food, but rather for\r\nbreeding purposes, and it seems that the whales select the more\r\ntemperate regions for the bringing forth of their young. This view is\r\nstrengthened by the statistical fœtal records, which show the pairing\r\ntakes place in the northern areas, that the fœtus is carried by the\r\nmother during the southern migration to the Antarctic, and that the\r\ncalves are born in the more congenial waters north of the sub-Antarctic\r\narea. We have still to prove, however, the possibility of a circumpolar\r\nmigration, and we are quite in the dark as to the number of whales that\r\nremain in sub-Antarctic areas during the Southern winter.\r\n\r\nThe following is a rough classification of whales, with special\r\nreference to those known to occur in the South Atlantic:\r\n\r\n               1.

TOOTHED WHALES (_Odontoceti_)\r\n      _________________________|________________________\r\nSperm whale              Beaked whales              Dolphins (_Physeter\r\ncatodon_) (including bottlenose whales)  (1) Killer (_Hyperoodon\r\nrostratus_)     (_Orcinus orca_) (2) Black Fish (_Globicephalus melas_)\r\n(3) Porpoises (_Lagenorhynchus_ sp.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subdivision of whalebone whales is one of degree in the size of the\r\nwhalebone. These whales have enormously muscular tongues, which press\r\nthe water through the whalebone lamellæ and thus, by a filtering\r\nprocess, retain the small food organisms. The food of the whalebone\r\nwhales is largely the small crustacea which occur in the _plankton_,\r\nthough some whales (humpback, fin whales, and sei whales) feed also on\r\nfish. The stomachs examined at South Georgia during December 1914,\r\nbelonged to the three species, humpbacks, fin whales, and blue whales,\r\nand all contained small crustacea—_Euphausiæ_, with a mixture of\r\n_amphipods_. The toothed whales—sperms and bottlenoses—are known to\r\nlive on squids, and that there is an abundance of this type of food in\r\nthe Weddell Sea was proved by an examination of penguin and seal\r\nstomachs. Emperor penguins (and hundreds of these were examined) were\r\ninvariably found to contain _Cephalopod_ “beaks,” while large, partly\r\ndigested squids were often observed in Weddell seals. A dorsal fin is\r\npresent in the rorquals but absent in right whales. With other\r\ncharacters, notably the size of the animal, it serves as a ready mark\r\nof identification, but is occasionally confusing owing to the variation\r\nin shape in some of the species.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of several schools of porpoises very few whales were\r\nseen during the outward voyage. Not till we approached the Falkland\r\narea did they appear in any numbers. Four small schools of fin whales\r\nand a few humpbacks were sighted on October 28 and 29, 1914, in lat.\r\n38° 01´ S., long. 55° 03´ W. and in lat. 40° 35´ S., long. 53° 11´ W.,\r\nwhile _Globicephalus melas_ was seen only once, in lat. 45° 17´ S.,\r\nlong. 48° 58´ W., on October 31, 1914. At South Georgia, the whales\r\ncaptured at the various stations in December 1914, were blue whales,\r\nfin whales, and humpbacks (arranged respectively according to numbers\r\ncaptured). During the fishing season 1914–15 (from December to March)\r\nin the area covered—South Georgia to the South Sandwich Islands and\r\nalong Coats’ Land to the head of the Weddell Sea—the records of whales\r\nwere by no means numerous. Two records only could with certainty be\r\nassigned to the humpback, and these were in the neighbourhood of the\r\nSouth Sandwich Islands. Pack-ice was entered in lat. 59° 55´ S., long.\r\n18° 28´ W., and blue whales were recorded daily until about 65° S.\r\nBetween lat. 65° 43´ S., long. 17° 30´ W., on December 27, 1914, and\r\nlat. 69° 59´ S., long. 17° 31´ W., on January 3, 1915, no whales were\r\nseen. On January 4, however, in lat. 69° 59´ S., long. 17° 36´ W., two\r\nlarge sperm whales appeared close ahead of the ship in fairly open\r\nwater, and were making westward. They remained sufficiently long on the\r\nsurface to render their identification easy. Farther south, blue whales\r\nwere only seen occasionally, and fin whales could only be identified in\r\none or two cases. Killers, however, were numerous, and the lesser piked\r\nwhale was quite frequent. There was no doubt about the identity of this\r\nlatter species as it often came close alongside the ship. From April to\r\nSeptember (inclusive) the sea was frozen over (with the exception of\r\nlocal “leads”), and whales were found to be absent. In October whales\r\nagain made their appearance, and from then onwards they were a daily\r\noccurrence. Identification of the species, however, was a difficult\r\nmatter, for the _Endurance_ was crushed and had sunk, and observations\r\nwere only possible from the ice-floe, or later on from the boats. The\r\nhigh vertical “spout” opening out into a dense spray was often visible,\r\nand denoted the presence of blue and fin whales. The lesser piked whale\r\nagain appeared in the “leads” close to our “camp” floe, and was easily\r\nidentified. An exceptional opportunity was presented to us on December\r\n6, 1915, when a school of eight bottlenose whales (_Hyperoodon\r\nrostratus_) appeared in small “pool” alongside “Ocean” Camp in lat. 67°\r\n47´ S., long. 52° 18´ W. These ranged from about 20 ft. to a little\r\nover 30 ft. in length, and were of a uniform dark dun colour—the large\r\nspecimens having a dull yellow appearance. There were no white spots.\r\nAt the edge of the pack-ice during the first half of April 1916, about\r\nlat. 62° S. and long. 54° W. (entrance to Bransfield Strait), whales\r\nwere exceedingly numerous, and these were chiefly fin whales, though a\r\nfew seemed to be sei whales. It is interesting to note that the fishing\r\nseason 1915–1916 was exceptionally productive—no less than 11,860\r\nwhales having been captured in the Falkland area alone.\r\n\r\nThe South Atlantic whaling industry, then, has reached a critical stage\r\nin development. It is now dependent on the captures of the large fin\r\nand blue whales, humpbacks having been rapidly reduced in numbers, so\r\nthat the total stock appears to have been affected. With regard to the\r\nother species, the southern right whale has never been abundant in the\r\ncaptures, the sperm whale and the sei whale have shown a good deal of\r\nseasonal variation, though never numerous, and the bottlenose and\r\nlesser piked whale have so far not been hunted, except in the case of\r\nthe latter for human food. The vigorous slaughter of whales both in the\r\nsub-Antarctic and in the sub-tropics, for the one area reacts on the\r\nother, calls for universal legislation to protect the whales from early\r\ncommercial extinction, and the industry, which is of world-wide\r\neconomic importance, from having to be abandoned. The British\r\nGovernment, with the control of the world’s best fisheries, is\r\nthoroughly alive to the situation, and an Inter-departmental Committee,\r\nunder the direction of the Colonial Office, is at present devising a\r\nworkable scheme for suitable legislation for the protection of the\r\nwhales and for the welfare of the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXPEDITION HUTS AT McMURDO SOUND\r\n\r\n\r\nBy SIR E. H. SHACKLETON\r\n\r\nThe following notes are designed for the benefit of future explorers\r\nwho may make McMurdo Sound a base for inland operations, and to clear\r\nany inaccuracies or ambiguities concerning the history, occupation, and\r\nstate of these huts.\r\n\r\n(1) THE NATIONAL ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION’S HUT AT HUT POINT—THE HEAD OF\r\nMcMURDO SOUND\r\n\r\n\r\nThis hut was constructed by Captain Scott in 1902, by the Expedition\r\nsent out by the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal Society, the\r\nGovernment, and by private subscription. Captain Robert F. Scott was\r\nappointed to the command of the Expedition. I served as Third\r\nLieutenant until February 1903, when I was invalided home through a\r\nbroken blood vessel in the lungs, the direct result of scurvy\r\ncontracted on the Southern journey. The _Discovery_ hut was a large\r\nstrong building, but was so draughty and cold in comparison with the\r\nship, which was moored one hundred yards away, that it was, during the\r\nfirst year, never used for living quarters. Its sole use was as a\r\nstorehouse, and a large supply of rough stores, such as flour, cocoa,\r\ncoffee, biscuit, and tinned meat, was left there in the event of its\r\nbeing used as a place of retreat should any disaster overtake the ship.\r\nDuring the second year occasional parties camped inside the hut, but no\r\nbunks or permanent sleeping quarters were ever erected. The discomfort\r\nof the hut was a byword on the Expedition, but it formed an excellent\r\ndepot and starting-point for all parties proceeding to the south.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Discovery_ finally left McMurdo Sound, the hut was stripped\r\nof all gear, including the stove, but there was left behind a large\r\ndepot of the stores mentioned above. I was not aware of this until I\r\nreturned to McMurdo Sound in February 1908, when I sent Adams, Joyce,\r\nand Wild across to the hut whilst the _Nimrod_ was lying off the ice.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the party they reported that the door had been burst\r\nopen, evidently by a southerly blizzard, and was jammed by snow outside\r\nand in, so they made an entrance through one of the lee windows. They\r\nfound the hut practically clear of snow, and the structure quite\r\nintact. I used the hut in the spring, _i.e._ September and October\r\n1908, as a storehouse for the large amount of equipment, food, and oil\r\nthat we were to take on the Southern journey. We built a sort of\r\nliving-room out of the cases of provisions, and swept out the debris.\r\nThe Southern Party elected to sleep there before the start, but the\r\nsupporting party slept outside in the tents, as they considered it\r\nwarmer.\r\n\r\nWe still continued to use the lee window as means of ingress and egress\r\nto avoid continual shovelling away of the snow, which would be\r\nnecessary as every southerly blizzard blocked up the main entrance. The\r\nvarious depot parties made use of the hut for replenishing their\r\nstores, which had been sledged from my own hut to Hut Point. On the\r\nnight of March 3, 1909, I arrived with the Southern Party, with a sick\r\nman, having been absent on the march 128 days. Our position was bad, as\r\nthe ship was north of us. We tried to burn the Magnetic Hut in the hope\r\nof attracting attention from the ship, but were not able to get it to\r\nlight. We finally managed to light a flare of carbide, and the ship\r\ncame down to us in a blizzard, and all were safely aboard at 1 a.m. on\r\nMarch 4, 1909. Before leaving the hut we jammed the window up with\r\nbaulks of timber, to the best of our ability, in the storm and\r\ndarkness. The hut was used again by the Ross Sea Section of this last\r\nExpedition. The snow was cleared out and extra stores were placed in\r\nit. From reports I have received the _Discovery_ Hut was in as good\r\ncondition in 1917 as it was in 1902.\r\n\r\nThe stores placed there in 1902 are intact. There are a few cases of\r\nextra provisions and oil in the hut, but no sleeping gear, or\r\naccommodation, nor stoves, and it must not be looked upon as anything\r\nelse than a shelter and a most useful _pied-à-terre_ for the start of\r\nany Southern journey. No stores nor any equipment have been taken from\r\nit during either of my two Expeditions.\r\n\r\n(2) CAPE ROYDS HUT\r\n\r\n\r\nFor several reasons, when I went into McMurdo Sound in 1908 in command\r\nof my own Expedition, known as the British Antarctic Expedition, after\r\nhaving failed to land on King Edward VII Land, I decided to build our\r\nhut at Cape Royds—a small promontory twenty-three miles north of Hut\r\nPoint. Here the whole shore party lived in comfort through the winter\r\nof 1908. When spring came stores were sledged to Hut Point, so that\r\nshould the sea-ice break up early between these two places we might not\r\nbe left in an awkward position. After the return of the Southern Party\r\nwe went direct north to civilization, so I never visited my hut again.\r\nI had left, however, full instructions with Professor David as to the\r\ncare of the hut, and before the whole Expedition left, the hut was put\r\nin order. A letter was pinned in a conspicuous place inside, stating\r\nthat there were sufficient provisions and equipment to last fifteen men\r\nfor one year, indicating also the details of these provisions and the\r\nposition of the coal store. The stove was in good condition, and the\r\nletter ended with an invitation for any succeeding party to make what\r\nuse they required of stores and hut. The hut was then locked and the\r\nkey nailed on the door in a conspicuous place. From the report of\r\nCaptain Scott’s last Expedition the hut was in good condition, and from\r\na still later report from the Ross Sea side of this present Expedition,\r\nthe hut was still intact.\r\n\r\n(3) CAPE EVANS HUT\r\n\r\n\r\nThis large and commodious hut was constructed by Captain Scott at Cape\r\nEvans on his last Expedition. The party lived in it in comfort, and it\r\nwas left well supplied with stores in the way of food and oil, and a\r\ncertain amount of coal. Several of the scientific staff of this present\r\nExpedition were ashore in it, when the _Aurora_, which was to have been\r\nthe permanent winter quarters, broke adrift in May 1915, and went north\r\nwith the ice. The hut became the permanent living quarters for the ten\r\nmarooned men, and thanks to the stores they were able to sustain life\r\nin comparative comfort, supplementing these stores from my hut at Cape\r\nRoyds. In January 1917, after I had rescued the survivors, I had the\r\nhut put in order and locked up.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, there are three available huts in McMurdo Sound.\r\n\r\n(a) The _Discovery_ Hut with a certain amount of rough stores, and only\r\nof use as a point of departure for the South.\r\n\r\n(b) Cape Royds Hut with a large amount of general stores, but no\r\nclothing or equipment now.\r\n\r\n(c) Cape Evans Hut with a large amount of stores, but no clothing or\r\nequipment and only a few sledges.\r\n\r\n(4) DEPOTS SOUTH OF HUT POINT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that several depots have been laid to the south of\r\nHut Point on the Barrier, the last being at the Gap (the entrance to\r\nthe Beardmore Glacier), no future Expedition should depend on them as\r\nthe heavy snowfall obliterates them completely. There is no record of\r\nthe depots of any Expedition being made use of by any subsequent\r\nExpedition. No party in any of my Expeditions has used any depot laid\r\ndown by a previous Expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Voyage of the _Endurance_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAdare, Cape\r\nAdmiralty\r\n    Range\r\nAgag\r\nAitken\r\nAlbatross\r\nAllardyce Range\r\nAllen, James\r\nAmphipods\r\nAmundsen\r\n    (dog)\r\n“Ancient Mariner,”\r\nAnimal life in Weddell Sea\r\n    _See also_ Penguins Seals _and_ Bird life\r\nAnnewkow Island\r\nAntarctic Circle\r\n    Derby\r\nArgentine\r\nArmitage, Cape\r\n    Lieut.\r\nAtmospheric effects\r\n    _See also_ Mirage _and_ Sun\r\nAttempt to cut ship out\r\n_Aurora,_\r\nAurora Australis\r\nAustralia\r\n\r\nBakewell\r\nBarne Glacier\r\nBarrier\r\n    Great Ice\r\n    surface\r\nBeardmore Glacier\r\nBeaufort Island\r\nBelgica Straits\r\nBergs\r\nBergschrund\r\nBernsten, Mr.\r\nBird life in Weddell Sea\r\nBlack Island\r\nBlackborrow\r\nBlizzards, severe\r\nBlue Ice Glacier\r\nBluff\r\n    depot\r\nBoats\r\nBovril\r\nBritish territory\r\nBrocklehurst, Capt.
