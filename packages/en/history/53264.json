Several interesting\r\nand valuable diaries or memoirs of officers who took part in the\r\ngreat struggle have been published of late[1], but no writer of the\r\npresent generation has dared to grapple with the details of the whole\r\nof the seven years of campaigning that lie between the _Dos Mayo_\r\nand Toulouse. Napier’s splendid work has held the field for sixty\r\nyears. Meanwhile an enormous bulk of valuable material has been\r\naccumulating in English, French, and Spanish, which has practically\r\nremained unutilized. Papers, public and private, are accessible whose\r\nexistence was not suspected in the ’thirties; an infinite number of\r\nautobiographies and reminiscences which have seen the light after fifty\r\nor sixty years of repose in some forgotten drawer, have served to fill\r\nup many gaps in our knowledge. At least one formal history of the first\r\nimportance, that of General Arteche y Moro, has been published. I fancy\r\nthat its eleven volumes are practically unknown in England, yet it is\r\nalmost as valuable as Toreño’s _Guerra de la Independencia_ in enabling\r\nus to understand the purely Spanish side of the war.\r\n\r\n  [1] I need only mention the diaries of Sir Harry Smith, Blakeney,\r\n  Shaw, and Tomkinson on our side, and Foy’s private diary and the\r\n  Memoirs of Fantin des Odoards, St. Chamans, and Thiébault on the\r\n  French.\r\n\r\nI trust therefore that it will not be considered presumptuous for one\r\nwho has been working for some ten or fifteen years at the original\r\nsources to endeavour to summarize in print the results of his\r\ninvestigations; for I believe that even the reader who has already\r\ndevoted a good deal of attention to the Peninsular War will find a\r\nconsiderable amount of new matter in these pages.\r\n\r\nMy resolve to take in hand a general history of the struggle was\r\nlargely influenced by the passing into the hands of All Souls College\r\nof the papers of one of its most distinguished fellows, the diplomatist\r\nSir Charles Vaughan. Not only had Vaughan unique opportunities for\r\nobserving the early years of the Peninsular War, but he turned them\r\nto the best account, and placed all his observations on record.\r\nI suppose that there was seldom a man who had a greater love for\r\ncollecting and filing information. His papers contain not only his\r\nown diaries and correspondence, but an infinite number of notes made\r\nfor him by Spanish friends on points which he desired to master, and\r\na vast bulk of pamphlets, proclamations, newspapers, and tables of\r\nstatistics, carefully bound together in bundles, which (as far as I\r\ncan see) have not been opened between the day of his death and that\r\non which they passed, by a legacy from his last surviving relative,\r\ninto the possession of his old college. Vaughan landed at Corunna in\r\nSeptember, 1808, in company with Charles Stuart, the first English\r\nemissary to the Central Junta. He rode with Stuart to Madrid and\r\nAranjuez, noting everything that he saw, from Roman inscriptions to\r\nthe views of local Alcaldes and priests on the politics of the day.\r\nHe contrived to interview many persons of importance--for example,\r\nhe heard from Cuesta’s own lips of his treasonable plot to overthrow\r\nthe Junta, and he secured a long conversation with Castaños as to\r\nthe Capitulation of Baylen, from which I have extracted some wholly\r\nnew facts as to that event. He then went to Aragon, where he stayed\r\nthree weeks in the company of the Captain-General Joseph Palafox.\r\nNot only did he cross-question Palafox as to all the details of his\r\nfamous defence of Saragossa, but he induced San Genis (the colonel\r\nwho conducted the engineering side of the operations) to write him a\r\nmemorandum, twelve pages long, as to the character and system of his\r\nwork. Vaughan accompanied Palafox to the front in November, but left\r\nthe Army of Aragon a day before the battle of Tudela. Hearing of the\r\ndisaster from the fugitives of Castaños’s army, he resolved to take\r\nthe news to Madrid. Riding hard for the capital, he crossed the front\r\nof Ney’s cavalry at Agreda, but escaped them and came safely through.\r\nOn arriving at Madrid he was given dispatches for Sir John Moore,\r\nand carried them to Salamanca. It was the news which he brought that\r\ninduced the British general to order his abortive retreat on Portugal.\r\nMoore entrusted to him not only his dispatch to Sir David Baird,\r\nbidding him retire into Galicia, but letters for Lord Castlereagh,\r\nwhich needed instant conveyance to London. Accordingly Vaughan rode\r\nwith headlong speed to Baird at Astorga, and from Astorga to Corunna,\r\nwhich he reached eleven days after his start from Tudela. From thence\r\nhe took ship to England and brought the news of the Spanish disasters\r\nto the British Ministry.\r\n\r\nVaughan remained some time in England before returning to Spain, but\r\nhe did not waste his time. Not only did he write a short account\r\nof the siege of Saragossa, which had a great vogue at the moment,\r\nbut he collected new information from an unexpected source. General\r\nLefebvre-Desnouettes, the besieger of Saragossa, arrived as a prisoner\r\nin England. Vaughan promptly went to Cheltenham, where the Frenchman\r\nwas living on parole, and had a long conversation with him as to the\r\ndetails of the siege, which he carefully compared with the narrative\r\nof Palafox. Probably no other person ever had such opportunities for\r\ncollecting first-hand information as to that famous leaguer. It will\r\nplease those who love the romantic side of history, to know that\r\nVaughan was introduced by Palafox to Agostina, the famous ‘Maid of\r\nSaragossa,’ and heard the tale of her exploit from the Captain-General\r\nless than three months after it had occurred. The doubts of Napier and\r\nothers as to her existence are completely dissipated by the diary of\r\nthis much-travelled Fellow of All Souls College.\r\n\r\nVaughan returned to Spain ere 1809 was out, and served under various\r\nEnglish ambassadors at Seville and Cadiz for the greater part of the\r\nwar. His papers and collections for the later years of the struggle are\r\nalmost as full and interesting as those for 1808 which I have utilized\r\nin this volume.\r\n\r\nI have worked at the Record Office on the British official papers of\r\nthe first years of the war, especially noting all the passages which\r\nare omitted in the printed dispatches of Moore and other British\r\ngenerals. The suppressed paragraphs (always placed within brackets\r\nmarked with a pencil) contain a good deal of useful matter, mainly\r\ncriticisms on individuals which it would not have been wise to publish\r\nat the time. There are a considerable number of intercepted French\r\ndispatches in the collection, and a certain amount of correspondence\r\nwith the Spaniards which contains facts and figures generally unknown.\r\nAmong the most interesting are the letters of General Leith, who was\r\nattached to the head quarters of Blake; in them I found by far the best\r\naccount of the operations of the Army of Galicia in Oct.-Nov., 1808,\r\nwhich I have come upon.\r\n\r\nAs to printed sources of information, I have read all the Parliamentary\r\npapers of 1808-9, and the whole file of the _Madrid Gazette_, as well\r\nas many scores of memoirs and diaries, French, English, and Spanish.\r\nI think that no important English or French book has escaped me;\r\nbut I must confess that some of the Spanish works quoted by General\r\nArteche proved unprocurable, both in London and Paris. The British\r\nMuseum Library is by no means strong in this department; it is even\r\nshort of obvious authorities, such as the monographs of St. Cyr and\r\nof Cabanes on the War in Catalonia. The memoirs of the Peninsular\r\nveterans on both sides often require very cautious handling; some\r\ncannot be trusted for anything that did not happen under the author’s\r\neye. Others were written so long after the events which they record,\r\nthat they are not even to be relied upon for facts which must have been\r\nunder his actual observation. For example, General Marbot claims that\r\nhe brought to Bayonne the dispatch from Murat informing Napoleon of\r\nthe insurrection of Madrid on May 2, and gives details as to the way\r\nin which the Emperor received the news. But it is absolutely certain,\r\nboth from the text of Murat’s letter and from Napoleon’s answer to it,\r\nthat the document was carried and delivered by a Captain Hannecourt.\r\nThe aged Marbot’s memory had played him false. There are worse cases,\r\nwhere an eye-witness, writing within a short time of the events which\r\nhe describes, gives a version which he must have known to be incorrect,\r\nfor the glorification of himself or some friend. Thiébault and Le\r\nNoble are bad offenders in this respect: Thiébault’s account of some\r\nof the incidents in Portugal and of the combat of Aldea del Ponte, Le\r\nNoble’s narrative of Corunna, seem to be deliberately falsified. I have\r\nfound one English authority who falls under the same suspicion. But\r\non both sides the majority of the mistakes come either from writers\r\nwho describe that which did not pass under their own eyes, or from\r\naged narrators who wrote their story twenty, thirty, or forty years\r\nafter the war was over. Their diaries written at the time are often\r\ninvaluable correctives to their memoirs or monographs composed after\r\nan interval; e.g. Foy’s rough diary lately published by Girod de l’Ain\r\ncontains some testimonials to Wellington and the British army very much\r\nmore handsomely expressed than anything which the General wrote in his\r\nformal history of the early campaigns of 1808.\r\n\r\nI hope to insert in my second volume a bibliography of all the works\r\nuseful for the first two years of the war. The inordinate size to which\r\nmy first volume has swelled has made it impossible to include in it a\r\nlist of authorities, which covers a good many pages.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that my Appendices include several extensive tables,\r\ngiving the organization of the French and Spanish armies in 1808.\r\nFor part of them I am indebted to General Arteche’s work; but the\r\nlarger half has been constructed at great cost of time and labour from\r\nscattered contemporary papers--from returns to be found in the most\r\nvaried places (some of the most important Spanish ones survive only in\r\nthe Record Office or in Vaughan’s papers, others only in the _Madrid\r\nGazette_). No one, so far as I know, had hitherto endeavoured to\r\nconstruct the complete table of the Spanish army in October, or of that\r\nof the exact composition of Napoleon’s ‘grand army’ in the same month.\r\nI hope my Appendices therefore may be found of some use.\r\n\r\nMore than one friend has asked me during the last few months whether\r\nit is worth while to rewrite the history of the Peninsular War when\r\nNapier’s great work is everywhere accessible. I can only reply that I\r\nno more dream of superseding the immortal six volumes of that grand\r\nold soldier, than Dr. S. R. Gardiner dreamed of superseding Clarendon’s\r\n_History of the Great Rebellion_ when he started to write the later\r\nvolumes of his account of the reign of Charles I. The books of Napier\r\nand Clarendon must remain as all-important contemporary narratives,\r\nwritten by men who saw clearly one aspect of the events which they\r\ndescribe; in each the personal element counts for much, and the\r\npolitical and individual sympathies and enmities of the historian have\r\ncoloured his whole work. No one would think of going to Clarendon for\r\nan unprejudiced account of the character and career of Oliver Cromwell.\r\nBut I do not think that it is generally realized that it is just as\r\nunsafe to go to Napier for an account of the aims and undertakings of\r\nthe Spanish Juntas, or the Tory governments of 1808-14. As a narrator\r\nof the incidents of war he is unrivalled: no one who has ever read them\r\ncan forget his soul-stirring descriptions of the charge of the Fusilier\r\nbrigade at Albuera, of the assault on the Great Breach at Badajoz, or\r\nthe storming of Soult’s positions on the Rhune. These and a hundred\r\nother eloquent passages will survive for ever as masterpieces of\r\nvigorous English prose.\r\n\r\nBut when he wanders off into politics, English or Spanish, Napier is\r\na less trustworthy guide. All his views are coloured by the fact that\r\nhe was a bitter enemy of the Tories of his own day. The kinsman not\r\nonly of Charles James Fox, but of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, he could\r\nnever look with unprejudiced eyes on their political opponents. Canning\r\nand Spencer Perceval were in his ideas men capable of any folly, any\r\ngratuitous perversity. Castlereagh’s splendid services to England\r\nare ignored: it would be impossible to discover from the pages of\r\nthe _Peninsular War_ that this was the man who picked out Wellington\r\nfor the command in Spain, and kept him there in spite of all manner\r\nof opposition. Nor is this all: Napier was also one of those strange\r\nEnglishmen who, notwithstanding all the evidence that lay before them,\r\nbelieved that Napoleon Bonaparte was a beneficent character, thwarted\r\nin his designs for the regeneration of Europe by the obstinate and\r\nnarrow-minded opposition of the British Government. In his preface, he\r\ngoes so far as to say that the Tories fought the Emperor not because\r\nhe was the dangerous enemy of the British Empire, but because he\r\nwas the champion of Democracy, and they the champions of caste and\r\nprivilege. When the tidings of Napoleon’s death at St. Helena reached\r\nhim (as readers of his _Life_ will remember), he cast himself down on\r\nhis sofa and wept for three hours! Hence it was that, in dealing with\r\nthe Tory ministries, he is ever a captious and unkind critic, while\r\nfor the Emperor he displays a respect that seems very strange in an\r\nenthusiastic friend of political liberty. Every one who has read the\r\nfirst chapters of his great work must see that Bonaparte gets off with\r\nslight reproof for his monstrous act of treachery at Bayonne, and for\r\nthe even more disgusting months of hypocritical friendship that had\r\npreceded it. While pouring scorn on Charles IV and Ferdinand VII, the\r\nsilly father and the rebellious son, whose quarrels were the Emperor’s\r\nopportunity, Napier forgets to rise to the proper point of indignation\r\nin dealing with the false friend who betrayed them. He almost writes\r\nas if there were some excuse for the crimes of robbery and kidnapping,\r\nif the victim were an imbecile or a bigot, or an undutiful son. The\r\nprejudice in favour of the Emperor goes so far that he even endeavours\r\nto justify obvious political and military mistakes in his conduct of\r\nthe Peninsular War, by throwing all the blame on the way in which his\r\nmarshals executed his orders, and neglecting to point out that the\r\norders themselves were impracticable.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Napier was just as over-hard to the Spaniards as\r\nhe was over-lenient to Bonaparte. He was one of those old Peninsular\r\nofficers who could never dismiss the memory of some of the things that\r\nhe had seen or heard. The cruelties of the Guerillas, the disgraceful\r\npanic on the eve of Talavera, the idiotic pride and obstinacy of\r\nCuesta, the cowardice of Imaz and La Peña, prejudiced him against\r\nall their countrymen. The turgid eloquence of Spanish proclamations,\r\nfollowed by the prosaic incapacity of Spanish performance, sickened\r\nhim. He always accepts the French rather than the Spanish version\r\nof a story, forgetting that Bonaparte and his official writers were\r\nauthorities quite as unworthy of implicit credence as their opponents.\r\nIn dealing with individual Spaniards--we may take for example Joseph\r\nPalafox, or the unfortunate Daoiz and Velarde--he is unjust to the\r\nextreme of cruelty. His astounding libel on La Romana’s army, I have\r\nhad occasion to notice in some detail on page 416 of this work.\r\nHe invariably exaggerates Spanish defeats, and minimizes Spanish\r\nsuccesses. He is reckless in the statements which he gives as to their\r\nnumbers in battle, or their losses in defeat. Evidently he did not\r\ntake the trouble to consult the elaborate collection of morning-states\r\nof armies and other official documents which the Spanish War Office\r\npublished several years before he wrote his first volume. All his\r\nfigures are borrowed from the haphazard guesses of the French marshals.\r\nThis may seem strong language to use concerning so great an author,\r\nbut minute investigation seems to prove that nearly every statement of\r\nNapier’s concerning a battle in which the Spaniards were engaged is\r\ndrawn from some French source. The Spaniards’ version is ignored. In\r\nhis indignation at the arrogance and obstinacy with which they often\r\nhampered his hero Wellington, he refuses to look at the extenuating\r\ncircumstances which often explain, or even excuse, their conduct.\r\nAfter reading his narrative, one should turn to Arguelles or Toreño or\r\nArteche, peruse their defence of their countrymen, and then make one’s\r\nultimate decision as to facts. Every student of the Peninsular War, in\r\nshort, must read Napier: but he must not think that, when the reading\r\nis finished, he has mastered the whole meaning and importance of the\r\ngreat struggle.\r\n\r\nThe topographical details of most of my maps are drawn from the\r\nsplendid Atlas published by the Spanish War Office during the last\r\ntwenty years. But the details of the placing of the troops are my own.\r\nI have been particularly careful in the maps of Vimiero and Corunna to\r\nindicate the position of every battalion, French or English.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am in duty bound to acknowledge the very kind assistance of three\r\nhelpers in the construction of this volume. The first compiled the\r\nIndex, after grappling with the whole of the proofs. The second, Mr.\r\nC. E. Doble, furnished me with a great number of suggestions as to\r\nrevision, which I have adopted. The third, Mr. C. T. Atkinson, of\r\nExeter College, placed at my disposition his wide knowledge of British\r\nregimental history, and put me in the way of obtaining many details as\r\nto the organization of Wellesley’s and Moore’s armies. I am infinitely\r\nobliged to all three.\r\n\r\n  C.

There are\r\nhistorians who have sought for the origins of the Peninsular War far\r\nback in the eternal and inevitable conflict between democracy and\r\nprivilege[3]: there are others who--accepting the Emperor’s own version\r\nof the facts--have represented it as a fortuitous development arising\r\nfrom his plan of forcing the Continental System upon every state in\r\nEurope. To us it seems that the moment beyond which we need not search\r\nbackward was that in which Bonaparte formulated to himself the idea\r\nthat he was not the successor of the greatest of the Bourbons, but of\r\nthe founder of the Holy Roman Empire. It is a different thing to claim\r\nto be the first of European monarchs, and to claim to be the king of\r\nkings. Louis XIV had wide-reaching ambitions for himself and for his\r\nfamily: but it was from his not very deep or accurate knowledge of\r\nCharlemagne that Napoleon had derived his idea of a single imperial\r\npower bestriding Europe, of a monarch whose writ ran alike at Paris and\r\nat Mainz, at Milan and at Hamburg, at Rome and at Barcelona, and whose\r\nvassal-princes brought him the tribute of all the lands of the Oder,\r\nthe Elbe, and the middle Danube[4].\r\n\r\n  [2] He works out the idea in his letter to Talleyrand of May 16,\r\n  1806.\r\n\r\n  [3] Such is the main thesis of chapter I of Napier’s _Peninsular\r\n  War_.\r\n\r\n  [4] It is curious to note how often the name of Charlemagne\r\n  occurs in Napoleon’s letters during the early months of 1806. It\r\n  is especially common in his correspondence about the relations of\r\n  the Papacy and the Empire.\r\n\r\nThere is no need for us to trace back the growth of Napoleon’s\r\nconception of himself as the successor of Charlemagne beyond the winter\r\nof 1805-6, the moment when victorious at Austerlitz and master for\r\nthe first time of Central Europe, he began to put into execution his\r\ngrandiose scheme for enfeoffing all the realms of the Continent as\r\nvassal states of the French Empire. He had extorted from Francis of\r\nAustria the renunciation of his meagre and time-worn rights as head\r\nof the Holy Roman Empire, because he intended to replace the ancient\r\nshadow by a new reality. The idea that he might be Emperor of Europe\r\nand not merely Emperor of the French was already developed, though\r\nPrussia still needed to be chastised, and Russia to be checked and\r\nturned back on to the ways of the East. It was after Austerlitz but\r\nbefore Jena that the foundations of the Confederation of the Rhine\r\nwere laid[5], and that the Emperor took in hand the erection of that\r\nseries of subject realms under princes of his own house, which was to\r\nculminate in the new kingdom of Spain ruled by ‘Joseph Napoleon the\r\nFirst.’ By the summer of 1806 the system was already well developed:\r\nthe first modest experiment, the planting out of his sister Eliza and\r\nher insignificant husband in the duchy of Lucca and Piombino was now\r\ntwelve months old. There had followed the gift of the old Bourbon\r\nkingdom of Naples to Joseph Bonaparte in February, 1806, and the\r\ntransformation of the Batavian Republic into Louis Bonaparte’s kingdom\r\nof Holland in June. The Emperor’s brother-in-law, Joachim Murat, had\r\nbeen made Grand-Duke of Berg in March, his sister, Pauline, Duchess\r\nof Guastalla in the same month. It cannot be doubted that his eye was\r\nalready roving all round Europe, marking out every region in which the\r\nsystem of feudatory states could be further extended.\r\n\r\n  [5] The negotiations for the Confederation were completed in\r\n  July, and it was formally constituted on Aug. 1, 1806.\r\n\r\nAt the ill-governed realms of Spain and Portugal it is certain that he\r\nmust have taken a specially long glance. He had against the house of\r\nthe Bourbons the grudge that men always feel against those whom they\r\nhave injured. He knew that they could never forgive the disappointed\r\nhopes of 1799, nor the murder of the Duc d’Enghien, however much they\r\nmight disguise their sentiments by base servility. What their real\r\nfeelings were might be guessed from the treacherous conduct of their\r\nkinsmen of Naples, whom he had just expelled from the Continent.\r\nThe Bourbons of Spain were at this moment the most subservient and\r\nthe most ill-used of his allies. Under the imbecile guidance of his\r\nfavourite Godoy, Charles IV had consistently held to the league with\r\nFrance since 1795, and had thereby brought down untold calamities upon\r\nhis realm. Nevertheless Napoleon was profoundly dissatisfied with\r\nhim as an ally. The seventy-two million francs of subsidies which he\r\nwas annually wringing from his impoverished neighbour seemed to him\r\na trifle. The chief gain that he had hoped to secure, when he goaded\r\nSpain into war with England in 1804, had been the assistance of her\r\nfleet, by whose aid he had intended to gain the control of the narrow\r\nseas, and to dominate the Channel long enough to enable him to launch\r\nhis projected invasion against the shores of Kent and Sussex. But the\r\nSpanish navy, always more formidable on paper than in battle, had\r\nproved a broken reed. The flower of its vessels had been destroyed at\r\nTrafalgar. There only remained in 1806 a few ships rotting in harbour\r\nat Cadiz, Cartagena, and Ferrol, unable even to concentrate on account\r\nof the strictness of Collingwood’s blockade. Napoleon was angry at his\r\nally’s impotence, and was already reflecting that in hands more able\r\nand energetic than those of Charles IV Spain might give aid of a very\r\ndifferent kind. In after years men remembered that as early as 1805 he\r\nhad muttered to his confidants that a Bourbon on the Spanish throne\r\nwas a tiresome neighbour--too weak as an ally, yet dangerous as a\r\npossible enemy[6]. For in spite of all the subservience of Charles IV\r\nthe Emperor believed, and believed quite rightly, that a Bourbon prince\r\nmust in his heart loathe the unnatural alliance with the child of the\r\nRevolution. But in 1806 Bonaparte had an impending war with Prussia on\r\nhis hands, and there was no leisure for interfering in the affairs of\r\nthe Peninsula. Spain, he thought, could wait, and it is improbable\r\nthat he had formulated in his brain any definite plan for dealing with\r\nher.\r\n\r\n  [6] See, for example, the very interesting story told by Marshal\r\n  Jourdan in his _Mémoires_ (p. 9) of the long conversation which\r\n  the emperor had with him at Verona on June 16, 1805: ‘Tant pour\r\n  l’affermissement de ma dynastie que pour la sûreté de France,’\r\n  concluded Napoleon, ‘un Bourbon sur le trône d’Espagne est un\r\n  voisin trop dangereux.’\r\n\r\nThe determining factor in his subsequent action was undoubtedly\r\nsupplied in the autumn of 1806 by the conduct of the Spanish government\r\nduring the campaign of Jena. There was a moment, just before that\r\ndecisive battle had been fought, during which European public opinion\r\nwas expecting a check to the French arms. The military prestige of\r\nPrussia was still very great, and it was well known that Russia had not\r\nbeen able to put forth her full strength at Austerlitz. Combined it\r\nwas believed that they would be too much for Napoleon. While this idea\r\nwas still current, the Spanish king, or rather his favourite Godoy,\r\nput forth a strange proclamation which showed how slight was the bond\r\nof allegiance that united them to France, and how hollow their much\r\nvaunted loyalty to the emperor[7]. It was an impassioned appeal to the\r\npeople of Spain to take arms _en masse_, and to help the government\r\nwith liberal gifts of men, horses and money. ‘Come,’ it said, ‘dear\r\nfellow countrymen, come and swear loyalty beneath the banners of the\r\nmost benevolent of sovereigns.’ The God of Victories was to smile on a\r\npeople which helped itself, and a happy and enduring peace was to be\r\nthe result of a vigorous effort. It might have been pleaded in defence\r\nof Charles IV that all this was very vague, and that the anonymous\r\nenemy who was to be crushed might be England. But unfortunately for\r\nthis interpretation, three whole sentences of the document are filled\r\nwith demands for horses and an instant increase in the cavalry arm\r\nof the Spanish military establishment. It could hardly be urged with\r\nseriousness that horsemen were intended to be employed against the\r\nEnglish fleet. And of naval armaments there was not one word in the\r\nproclamation.\r\n\r\n  [7] For the full text of this bombastic appeal see Appendix, No.\r\n  I. Godoy speaks throughout in his own name, not in that of his\r\n  master.\r\n\r\nThis document was issued on Oct. 5, 1806: not long after there arrived\r\nin Madrid the news of the battle of Jena and the capture of Berlin.\r\nThe Prince of the Peace was thunderstruck at the non-fulfilment of\r\nhis expectations and the complete triumph of Napoleon. He hastened to\r\ncountermand his armaments, and to shower letters of explanation and\r\napology on the Emperor, pointing out that his respected ally could\r\nnot possibly have been the ‘enemy’ referred to in the proclamation.\r\nThat document had reached Napoleon on the very battle-field of Jena,\r\nand had caused a violent paroxysm of rage in the august reader[8].\r\nBut, having Russia still to fight, he repressed his wrath for a\r\nmoment, affecting to regard as satisfactory Godoy’s servile letters\r\nof explanation. Yet we can hardly doubt that this was the moment at\r\nwhich he made up his mind that the House of Bourbon must cease to\r\nreign in Spain. He must have reflected on the danger that southern\r\nFrance had escaped; a hundred thousand Spaniards might have marched\r\non Bordeaux or Toulouse at the moment of Jena, and there would have\r\nbeen no army whatever on the unguarded frontier of the Pyrenees to\r\nhold them in check. Supposing that Jena had been deferred a month,\r\nor that no decisive battle at all had been fought in the first stage\r\nof the struggle with Prussia, it was clear that Godoy would have\r\ncommitted himself to open war. A stab in the back, even if dealt with\r\nno better weapon than the disorganized Spanish army, must have deranged\r\nall Napoleon’s plans, and forced him to turn southward the reserves\r\ndestined to feed the ‘Grand Army.’ It was clear that such a condition\r\nof affairs must never be allowed to recur, and we should naturally\r\nexpect to find that, the moment the war of 1806-7 was ended, Napoleon\r\nwould turn against Spain, either to dethrone Charles IV, or at least to\r\ndemand the dismissal from office of Godoy. He acknowledged this himself\r\nat St. Helena: the right thing to have done, as he then conceded, would\r\nhave been to declare open war on Spain immediately after Tilsit[9].\r\n\r\n  [8] ‘Je jurai dès lors qu’ils me la paieraient, que je les\r\n  mettrais hors d’état de me nuire,’ said Napoleon to De Pradt,\r\n  eighteen months later (_Mémoires sur la Révolution d’Espagne_, p.\r\n  16). The archbishop’s story is amply borne out by the repeated\r\n  allusions to this unhappy proclamation in Napoleon’s official\r\n  justification of his conduct in Spain. The Spanish ambassador at\r\n  Berlin, Don Benito Pardo, was told by Napoleon at the time that\r\n  he had forgiven the Proclamation, but could not forget it.\r\n\r\n  [9] _Correspondance de Napoléon_, xxxii. 59.\r\n\r\nAfter eight years of experience of Bonaparte as an ally, the rulers\r\nof Spain ought to have known that his silence during the campaigns of\r\nEylau and Friedland boded them no good. But his present intentions\r\nescaped them, and they hastened to atone for the proclamation of\r\nOct. 5 by a servile obedience to all the orders which he sent them.\r\nThe most important of these was the command to mobilize and send\r\nto the Baltic 15,000 of their best troops [March, 1807]. This was\r\npromptly done, the depleted battalions and squadrons being raised to\r\nwar-strength, by drafts of men and horses which disorganized dozens\r\nof the corps that remained at home[10]. The reason alleged, the fear\r\nof Swedish and English descents on the rear of the Grand Army, was\r\nplausible, but there can be no doubt that the real purpose was to\r\ndeprive Spain of a considerable part, and that the most efficient, of\r\nher disposable forces. If Godoy could have listened to the interviews\r\nof Napoleon and Alexander of Russia at Tilsit, he would have been\r\nterrified at the offhand way in which the Emperor suggested to the\r\nCzar that the Balearic Isles should be taken from Spain and given to\r\nFerdinand of Naples, if the latter would consent to cede Sicily to\r\nJoseph Napoleon[11]. To despoil his allies was quite in the usual\r\nstyle of Bonaparte--Godoy cannot have forgotten the lot of Trinidad\r\nand Ceylon--but he had not before proposed to tear from Spain, not a\r\ndistant colony, but an ancient province of the Aragonese crown. The\r\nproject was enshrined in the ‘secret and supplementary’ clauses of the\r\nTreaty of Tilsit, which Napoleon wished to conceal till the times were\r\nripe.\r\n\r\n  [10] The demand was made in the most peremptory fashion, and\r\n  in almost threatening language. Napoleon writes to Talleyrand\r\n  that the Spanish division in Tuscany, which was to form part of\r\n  the expeditionary corps, must march in twenty-four hours after\r\n  receiving its orders. ‘If they refuse, everything is at an end,’\r\n  a most sinister phrase (Napoleon to Talleyrand, March 25, 1807).\r\n\r\n  [11] This was Article IV of the Seven ‘Secret Articles’ of the\r\n  Treaty of Tilsit. See for this proposal the notes in Vandal’s\r\n  _Napoléon et Alexandre Ier_, vol. i.\r\n\r\nIt was only when Bonaparte had returned to France from his long\r\ncampaign in Poland that the affairs of the Iberian Peninsula began to\r\ncome seriously to the front. The Emperor arrived in Paris at the end\r\nof July, 1807, and this was the moment at which he might have been\r\nexpected to produce the rod, for the chastisement which the rulers of\r\nSpain had merited by their foolish proclamation of the preceding year.\r\nBut no sign of any such intention was displayed: it is true that early\r\nin August French troops in considerable numbers began to muster at\r\nBayonne[12], but Bonaparte openly declared that they were destined to\r\nbe used, not against Spain, but against Portugal. One of the articles\r\nof the Peace of Tilsit had been to the effect that Sweden and Portugal,\r\nthe last powers in Europe which had not submitted to the Continental\r\nSystem, should be compelled--if necessary by force--to adhere to it,\r\nand to exclude the commerce of England from their ports. It was natural\r\nthat now, as in 1801, a French contingent should be sent to aid Spain\r\nin bringing pressure to bear on her smaller neighbour. With this idea\r\nGodoy and his master persisted in the voluntary blindness to the signs\r\nof the times which they had so long been cultivating. They gave their\r\nambassador in Lisbon orders to act in all things in strict conjunction\r\nwith his French colleague.\r\n\r\n  [12] The first notice of the ‘Corps of Observation of the\r\n  Gironde’ is to be found in a dispatch of Masserano, the Spanish\r\n  ambassador at Paris, dated July 30, which gives notice of the\r\n  approaching concentration at Bayonne. But the quiet movement of\r\n  troops in this direction had begun long before the Russian war\r\n  was over.\r\n\r\nOn August 12, therefore, the representatives of Spain and France\r\ndelivered to John, the Prince-Regent of Portugal (his mother, Queen\r\nMaria, was insane), almost identical notes, in which they declared that\r\nthey should ask for their passports and leave Lisbon, unless by the\r\nfirst of September the Regent had declared war on England, joined his\r\nfleet to that of the allied powers, confiscated all British goods in\r\nhis harbours, and arrested all British subjects within the bounds of\r\nhis kingdom. The prince, a timid and incapable person, whose only wish\r\nwas to preserve his neutrality, answered that he was ready to break\r\noff diplomatic relations with England, and to close his ports against\r\nBritish ships, but that the seizure of the persons and property of the\r\nBritish merchants, without any previous declaration of war, would be\r\ncontrary to the rules of international law and morality. For a moment\r\nhe hoped that this half-measure would satisfy Napoleon, that he might\r\nsubmit to the Continental System without actually being compelled to\r\ndeclare war on Great Britain. But when dispatches had been interchanged\r\nbetween the French minister Rayneval and his master at Paris, the\r\nanswer came that the Regent’s offer was insufficient, and that the\r\nrepresentatives of France and Spain were ordered to quit Lisbon at\r\nonce. This they did on September 30, but without issuing any formal\r\ndeclaration of war.\r\n\r\nOn October 18, the French army, which had been concentrating at Bayonne\r\nsince the beginning of August, under the harmless name of the ‘Corps of\r\nObservation of the Gironde,’ crossed the Bidassoa at Irun and entered\r\nSpain. It had been placed under the orders of Junot, one of Napoleon’s\r\nmost active and vigorous officers, but not a great strategist after the\r\nstyle of Masséna, Soult, or Davoust. He was a good fighting-man, but a\r\nmediocre general. The reason that he received the appointment was that\r\nhe had already some knowledge of Portugal, from having held the post\r\nof ambassador at Lisbon in 1805. He had been promised a duchy and a\r\nmarshal’s bâton if his mission was carried out to his master’s complete\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that from the first Napoleon had intended that Portugal\r\nshould refuse the ignominious orders which he had given to the\r\nPrince-Regent. If he had only been wishing to complete the extension of\r\nthe Continental System over all Southern Europe, the form of obedience\r\nwhich had been offered him by the Portuguese government would have\r\nbeen amply sufficient. But he was aiming at annexation, and not at\r\nthe mere assertion of his suzerainty over Portugal. The fact that he\r\nbegan to mass troops at Bayonne before he commenced to threaten the\r\nRegent is sufficient proof of his intentions. An army was not needed\r\nto coerce the Portuguese: for it was incredible that in the then\r\ncondition of European affairs they would dare to risk war with France\r\nand Spain by adhering too stiffly to the cause of England. The Regent\r\nwas timid and his submission was certain; but Napoleon took care to\r\ndictate the terms that he offered in such an offensive form that the\r\nPortuguese government would be tempted to beg for changes of detail,\r\nthough it sorrowfully accepted the necessity of conceding the main\r\npoint--war with England and the acceptance of the Continental System.\r\nThe Prince-Regent, as might have been expected, made a feeble attempt\r\nto haggle over the more ignominious details, and then Napoleon withdrew\r\nhis ambassador and let loose his armies.\r\n\r\nShortly after Junot had crossed the Bidassoa there was signed at\r\nFontainebleau the celebrated secret treaty which marks the second\r\nstage of the Emperor’s designs against the Peninsula. It was drawn up\r\nby Duroc, Napoleon’s marshal of the palace, and Eugenio Izquierdo,\r\nthe agent of Godoy. For the official ambassador of Spain in Paris,\r\nthe Prince of Masserano, was not taken into the confidence of his\r\nmaster[13]. All delicate matters were conducted by the favourite’s\r\nprivate representative, an obscure but astute personage, the director\r\nof the Botanical Gardens at Madrid, whose position was legitimized by\r\na royal sign-manual giving him powers to treat as a plenipotentiary\r\nwith France. ‘Manuel is your protector: do what he tells you, and by\r\nserving him you serve me,’ the old king had said, when giving him his\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\n  [13] Talleyrand declares in his _Mémoires_ (i. 349) that Napoleon\r\n  kept Champagny, his own minister of foreign affairs, in equal\r\n  darkness.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Fontainebleau is a strange document, whose main purpose,\r\nat a first glance, seems to be the glorification of Godoy. It is\r\ncomposed of fourteen articles[14], the most important of which contain\r\nthe details of a projected dismemberment of Portugal. The country was\r\nto be cut up into three parts. Oporto and the northern province of\r\nEntre-Douro-e-Minho were to become the ‘Kingdom of Northern Lusitania,’\r\nand to be ceded to a Bourbon, the young King of Etruria, whom Napoleon\r\nwas just evicting from his pleasant abode at Florence. All Southern\r\nPortugal, the large province of Alemtejo and the coast region of\r\nAlgarve, was to be given as an independent principality to Godoy, under\r\nthe title of ‘Prince of the Algarves’[15]. The rest of Portugal, Lisbon\r\nand the provinces of Beira, Estremadura and Tras-os-Montes were to be\r\nsequestrated till the conclusion of a general peace, and meanwhile were\r\nto be governed and administered by the French. Ultimately they were to\r\nbe restored, or not restored, to the house of Braganza according as the\r\nhigh contracting parties might determine.\r\n\r\n  [14] See the text in Appendix, No. II.\r\n\r\n  [15] In the curious exculpatory memoirs which Godoy published\r\n  in 1835-6, with the aid of d’Esménard, he endeavours to make\r\n  out that he never desired the principality, and that Napoleon\r\n  pressed it upon him, because he wished to remove him from about\r\n  the person of Charles IV. ‘The gift of the principality of the\r\n  Algarves was a banishment’ (i. 54). This plea will not stand\r\n  in the face of the fact that Godoy had solicited just such\r\n  preferment as far back as the spring of 1806; see Arteche,\r\n  _Guerra de la Independencia_, i. 148. His real object was to\r\n  secure a place of refuge at the death of Charles IV.\r\n\r\nInstead therefore of receiving punishment for his escapade in the\r\nautumn of 1806, Godoy was to be made by Napoleon a sovereign prince!\r\nBut Spain, as apart from the favourite, got small profit from this\r\nextraordinary treaty: Charles IV might take, within the next three\r\nyears, the pompous title of ‘Emperor of the Two Americas,’ and was to\r\nbe given some share of the transmarine possessions of Portugal--which\r\nmeanwhile (treaties or no) would inevitably fall into the hands of\r\nGreat Britain, who held the command of the seas, while Napoleon did not.\r\n\r\nIt is incredible that Bonaparte ever seriously intended to carry out\r\nthe terms of the Treaty of Fontainebleau: they were not even to be\r\ndivulged (as Article XIV stipulated) till it was his pleasure. Godoy\r\nhad deserved badly of him, and the Emperor was never forgiving. The\r\nfavourite’s whole position and character (as we shall presently show)\r\nwere so odious and disgraceful, that it would have required an even\r\ngreater cynicism than Napoleon possessed, to overthrow an ancient and\r\nrespectable kingdom in order to make him a sovereign prince. To pose\r\nperpetually as the regenerator of Europe, and her guardian against\r\nthe sordid schemes of Britain, and then to employ as one’s agent for\r\nregeneration the corrupt and venal favourite of the wicked old Queen of\r\nSpain, would have been too absurd. Napoleon’s keen intelligence would\r\nhave repudiated the idea, even in the state of growing autolatry into\r\nwhich he was already lapsing in the year 1807. What profit could there\r\nbe in giving a kingdom to a false friend, already convicted of secret\r\ndisloyalty, incapable, disreputable, and universally detested?\r\n\r\nBut if we apply another meaning to the Treaty of Fontainebleau we\r\nget a very different light upon it. If we adopt the hypothesis that\r\nBonaparte’s real aim was to obtain an excuse for marching French\r\narmies into Spain without exciting suspicion, all its provisions\r\nbecome intelligible. ‘This Prince of the Peace,’ he said in one of his\r\nconfidential moments, ‘this mayor of the palace, is loathed by the\r\nnation; he is the rascal who will himself open for me the gates of\r\nSpain[16].’ The phantom principality that was dangled before Godoy’s\r\neyes was only designed to attract his attention while the armies of\r\nFrance were being poured across the Pyrenees. It is doubtful whether\r\nthe Emperor intended the project of the ‘Principality of the Algarves’\r\nto become generally known. If he did, it must have been with the\r\nintention of making the favourite more odious than he already was to\r\npatriotic Spaniards, at the moment when he and his master were about\r\nto be brushed away by a sweep of the imperial arm. That Napoleon was\r\nalready in October preparing other armies beside that of Junot, and\r\nthat he purposed to overrun Spain when the time was ripe, is shown in\r\nthe Treaty itself. Annexed to it is a convention regulating the details\r\nof the invasion of Portugal: the sixth clause of this paper mentions\r\nthat it was the emperor’s intention to concentrate 40,000 more troops\r\nat Bayonne--in case Great Britain should threaten an armed descent on\r\nPortugal--and that this force would be ready to cross the Pyrenees by\r\nNovember 20. Napoleon sent not 40,000 but 100,000 men, and pushed them\r\ninto Spain, though no English invasion of Portugal had taken place, or\r\neven been projected. After this is it possible to believe for a moment\r\nin his good faith, or to think that the Treaty of Fontainebleau was\r\nanything more than a snare?\r\n\r\n  [16] ‘Le Prince de la Paix, véritable maire du palais, est en\r\n  horreur à la nation. C’est un gredin qui m’ouvrira lui-même les\r\n  portes de l’Espagne’ (Fouché, _Mémoires_, i. 365).\r\n\r\nThose who could best judge what was at the back of the emperor’s mind,\r\nsuch as Talleyrand and Fouché, penetrated his designs long before the\r\ntreaty of Fontainebleau had been signed. Talleyrand declares in his\r\nmemoirs[17] that the reason for which he was deprived of the portfolio\r\nof Foreign Affairs in August, 1807, was that he had disliked the scheme\r\nof invading Spain in a treacherous fashion, and warned his master\r\nagainst it. No improbability is added to this allegation by the fact\r\nthat Napoleon at St. Helena repeatedly stated that Talleyrand had\r\nfirst thought of the idea, and had recommended it to him ‘while at\r\nthe same time contriving to set an opinion abroad that he was opposed\r\nto the design.’ On the other hand, we are not convinced of the Prince\r\nof Benevento’s innocence merely by the fact that he wrote in his\r\nautobiography that he was a strenuous opponent of the plan. He says\r\nthat the emperor broached the whole scheme to him the moment that he\r\nreturned from Tilsit, asseverating that he would never again expose\r\nhimself to the danger of a stab in the back at some moment when he\r\nmight be busy in Central Europe[18]. He himself, he adds, combated the\r\nproject by every possible argument, but could not move his master an\r\ninch from his purpose. This is probably true; but we believe it not\r\nbecause Talleyrand wrote it down--his bills require the endorsement of\r\nsome backer of a less tarnished reputation--but because the whole of\r\nthe Spanish episode is executed in the true Napoleonesque manner. Its\r\nscientific mixture of force and fraud is clearly the work of the same\r\nhand that managed the details of the fall of the Venetian Republic, and\r\nof the dethroning of Pope Pius VII. It is impossible to ascribe the\r\nplot to any other author.\r\n\r\n  [17] Talleyrand, _Mémoires_, i. 308-329.\r\n\r\n  [18] Ibid., i. 378, 379.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE COURT OF SPAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nJunot’s army was nearing the Portuguese frontier, and the reserve at\r\nBayonne was already beginning to assemble--it was now styled ‘the\r\nSecond Corps of Observation of the Gironde’--when a series of startling\r\nevents took place at the Spanish Court. On October 27, the very day\r\nthat the treaty of Fontainebleau was signed, Ferdinand, Prince of the\r\nAsturias, was seized by his father and thrown into confinement, on a\r\ncharge of high treason, of having plotted to dethrone or even to murder\r\nhis aged parent. This astonishing development in the situation need\r\nnot be laid to Napoleon’s charge. There have been historians who think\r\nthat he deliberately stirred up the whole series of family quarrels at\r\nMadrid: but all the materials for trouble were there already, and the\r\nshape which they took was not particularly favourable to the Emperor’s\r\npresent designs. They sprang from the inevitable revolt against the\r\npredominance of Godoy, which had long been due.\r\n\r\nThe mere fact that an incapable upstart like Godoy had been able to\r\ncontrol the foreign and internal policy of Spain ever since 1792 is a\r\nsufficient evidence of the miserable state of the country. He was a\r\nmere court favourite of the worst class: to compare him to Buckingham\r\nwould be far too flattering--and even Piers Gaveston had a pretty\r\nwit and no mean skill as a man-at-arms, though he was also a vain\r\nostentatious fool. After a few years, we may remember, the one met the\r\ndagger and the other the axe, with the full approval of English public\r\nopinion. But Godoy went on flourishing like the green bay-tree, for\r\nsixteen years, decked with titles and offices and laden with plunder,\r\nwith no other support than the queen’s unconcealed partiality for\r\nhim, and the idiotic old king’s desire to have trouble taken off his\r\nhands. Every thinking man in Spain hated the favourite as the outward\r\nand visible sign of corruption in high places. Every patriot saw that\r\nthe would-be statesman who made himself the adulator first of Barras\r\nand then of Bonaparte, and played cat’s-paw to each of them, to the\r\nultimate ruin and bankruptcy of the realm, ought to be removed. Yet\r\nthere was no sign of any movement against him, save obscure plots in\r\nthe household of the Prince Royal. But for the interference of Napoleon\r\nin the affairs of Spain, it is possible that the Prince of the Peace\r\nmight have enjoyed many years more of power. Such is the price which\r\nnations pay for handing over their bodies to autocratic monarchy and\r\ntheir souls to three centuries of training under the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps necessary to gain some detailed idea of the unpleasant\r\nfamily party at Madrid. King Charles IV was now a man of sixty years\r\nof age: he was so entirely simple and helpless that it is hardly an\r\nexaggeration to say that his weakness bordered on imbecility. His elder\r\nbrother, Don Philip, was so clearly wanting in intellect that he had to\r\nbe placed in confinement and excluded from the throne. It might occur\r\nto us that it would have been well for Spain if Charles had followed\r\nhim to the asylum, if we had not to remember that the crown would then\r\nhave fallen to Ferdinand of Naples, who if more intelligent was also\r\nmore morally worthless than his brother. Till the age of forty Charles\r\nhad been entirely suppressed and kept in tutelage by an autocratic\r\nfather: when he came to the throne he never developed any will or mind\r\nof his own, and remained the tool and servant of those about him. He\r\nmay be described as a good-natured and benevolent imbecile: he was not\r\ncruel or malicious or licentious, or given to extravagant fancies.\r\nHis one pronounced taste was hunting: if he could get away from his\r\nministers to some country palace, and go out all day with his dogs,\r\nhis gun, and his gamekeepers, he was perfectly happy. His brother of\r\nNaples, it will be remembered, had precisely the same hobby. Of any\r\nother tastes, save a slight interest in some of the minor handicrafts,\r\nwhich he shared with his cousin Louis XVI, we find no trace in the old\r\nking. He was very ugly, not with the fierce clever ugliness of his\r\nfather Charles III, but in an imbecile fashion, with a frightfully\r\nreceding forehead, a big nose, and a retreating jaw generally set in\r\na harmless grin. He did not understand business or politics, but was\r\nquite capable of getting through speeches and ceremonies when properly\r\nprimed and prompted beforehand. Even his private letters were managed\r\nfor him by his wife and his favourite. He had just enough brains to be\r\nproud of his position as king, and to resent anything that he regarded\r\nas an attack on his dignity--such as the mention of old constitutional\r\nrights and privileges, or any allusion to a Cortes. He liked, in fact,\r\nto feel himself and to be called an absolute king, though he wished to\r\nhand over all the duties and worries of kingship to his wife and his\r\nchosen servants. Quite contrary to Spanish usage, he often associated\r\nMaria Luisa’s name with his own in State documents, and in popular\r\ndiction they were often called ‘los Reyes,’ ‘the Kings,’ as Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella had been three hundred years before.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was about the most unfit person in Europe to be placed on\r\nthe throne at the side of such an imbecile husband. She was his first\r\ncousin, the daughter of his uncle Don Philip, Duke of Parma-Bourbon\r\non the mother’s side also, for she was the child of the daughter of\r\nLouis XV of France. Maria Luisa was self-confident, flighty, reckless,\r\nand utterly destitute of conscience of any sort. Her celebrated\r\nportrait by Goya gives us at once an idea of the woman, bold,\r\nshameless, pleasure-loving, and as corrupt as Southern court morality\r\nallows--which is saying a good deal. She had from the first taken the\r\nmeasure of her imbecile husband: she dominated him by her superior\r\nforce of will, made him her mere mouthpiece, and practically ruled\r\nthe realm, turning him out to hunt while she managed ministers and\r\nambassadors.\r\n\r\nFor the last twenty years her scandalous partiality for Don Manuel\r\nGodoy had been public property. When Charles IV came to the throne\r\nGodoy was a mere private in the bodyguard--a sort of ornamental corps\r\nof gentlemen-at-arms. He was son of a decayed noble family, a big\r\nhandsome showy young man of twenty-one--barely able to read and write,\r\nsay his detractors--but a good singer and musician. Within four years\r\nafter he caught the Queen’s eye he was a grandee of Spain, a duke,\r\nand prime minister! He was married to a royal princess, the Infanta\r\nTeresa, a cousin of the King, a mésalliance unparalleled in the whole\r\nhistory of the house of Bourbon. Three years later, to commemorate his\r\npart in concluding the disgraceful peace of Basle, he was given the\r\nodd title of ‘Prince of the Peace,’ ‘Principe de la Paz’: no Spanish\r\nsubject had ever before been decorated with any title higher than that\r\nof duke[19]. In 1808 he was a man of forty, beginning to get a little\r\nplump and bald after so many years of good (or evil) living, but still\r\na fine personable figure. He had stowed away enormous riches, not\r\nonly from the gifts of the King and Queen, but by the sale of offices\r\nand commissions, the taking of all sorts of illicit percentages, and\r\n(perhaps the worst symptom of all) by colossal speculations on the\r\nstock exchange. A French ambassador recorded the fact that he had to\r\nkeep the treaty of peace of 1802 quiet for three days after it was\r\nsigned, in order that Godoy might complete his purchases ‘for a rise’\r\nbefore the news got about[20]. Godoy was corrupt and licentious, but\r\nnot cruel or even tyrannical: though profoundly ignorant, he had the\r\nvanity to pose as a patron of art and science. His foible was to be\r\nhailed as a universal benefactor, and as the introducer of modern\r\ncivilization into Spain. He endeavoured to popularize the practice of\r\nvaccination, waged a mild and intermittent war with the Inquisition,\r\nand (a most astonishing piece of courage) tried to suppress the custom\r\nof bull-fighting. The last two acts were by far the most creditable\r\nitems that can be put down to his account: unfortunately they were also\r\nprecisely those which appealed least to the populace of Spain. Godoy\r\nwas a notable collector of pictures and antiquities, and had a certain\r\nliking for, and skill in, music. When this has been said, there is\r\nnothing more to put down in his favour. Fifteen years of power had so\r\nturned his head that for a long time he had been taking himself quite\r\nseriously, and his ambition had grown so monstrous that, not contented\r\nwith his alliance by marriage with the royal house, he was dreaming of\r\nbecoming a sovereign prince. The bait by which Napoleon finally drew\r\nhim into the trap, the promise that he should be given the Algarves\r\nand Alemtejo, was not the Corsican’s own invention. It had been an old\r\nidea of Godoy’s which he broached to his ally early in 1806, only to\r\nreceive a severe rebuff. Hence came the joy with which he finally saw\r\nit take shape in the treaty of Fontainebleau[21]. When such schemes\r\nwere running in his head, we can perfectly well credit the accusation\r\nwhich Prince Ferdinand brought against him, of having intended to\r\nchange the succession to the crown of Spain, by a _coup d’état_ on the\r\ndeath of Charles IV. The man had grown capable of any outburst of pride\r\nand ambition. Meanwhile he continued to govern Spain by his hold over\r\nthe imbecile and gouty old king and his worthless wife, who was now far\r\nover fifty, but as besotted on her favourite as ever. It was his weary\r\nlot to be always in attendance on them. They could hardly let him out\r\nof their sight. Toreño relates a ridiculous story that, when Napoleon\r\ninvited them to dinner on the first night of their unhappy visit to\r\nBayonne, he did not ask the Prince of the Peace to the royal table.\r\nCharles was so unhappy and uncomfortable that he could not settle down\r\nto his meal till the emperor had sent for Godoy, and found a place for\r\nhim near his master and mistress[22].\r\n\r\n  [19] The princes that occur in Spanish politics, e.g. Eboli or\r\n  Castelfranco, were holders of Italian, generally Neapolitan,\r\n  titles.\r\n\r\n  [20] Foy, _Guerre de la Péninsule_, ii. 267.\r\n\r\n  [21] See the proofs from papers in the Spanish Foreign Office,\r\n  quoted in Arteche’s _Guerra de la Independencia_, i. 148.\r\n\r\n  [22] Toreño, i. 86. The story is confirmed by Savary, in his\r\n  _Mémoires_, ii. 221.\r\n\r\nThe fourth individual with whose personality it is necessary to be\r\nacquainted when studying the court of Spain in 1808 is the heir to the\r\nthrone, Ferdinand, Prince of the Asturias. Little was known of him,\r\nfor his parents and Godoy had carefully excluded him from political\r\nlife. But when a prince is getting on for thirty, and his father has\r\nbegun to show signs of failing health, it is impossible that eyes\r\nshould not be turned on him from all quarters. Ferdinand was not an\r\nimbecile like his father, nor a scandalous person like his mother; but\r\n(though Spain knew it not) he was coward and a cur. With such parents\r\nhe had naturally been brought up very badly. He was ignominiously\r\nexcluded from all public business, and kept in absolute ignorance of\r\nall subjects on which a prince should have some knowledge: history,\r\nmilitary science, modern politics, foreign languages, were all sealed\r\nbooks to him. He had been educated, so far as he was trained at all,\r\nby a clever and ambitious priest, Juan Escoiquiz, a canon of Toledo.\r\nAn obscure churchman was not the best tutor for a future sovereign: he\r\ncould not instruct the prince in the more necessary arts of governance,\r\nbut he seems to have taught him dissimulation and superstition[23].\r\nFor Ferdinand was pious with a grovelling sort of piety, which made\r\nhim carry about strings of relics, spend much of his time in church\r\nceremonies, and (as rumour said) take to embroidering petticoats for\r\nhis favourite image of the Virgin in his old age.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n    MARIA LUISA\r\n    _REYNA DE ESPAÑA_.]\r\n\r\nThe prince had one healthy sentiment, a deep hatred for Godoy, who had\r\nfrom his earliest youth excluded him from his proper place in the court\r\nand the state. But he was too timid to resent the favourite’s influence\r\nby anything but sulky rudeness. If he had chosen, he could at once\r\nhave put himself at the head of the powerful body of persons whom the\r\nfavourite had disobliged or offended. His few intimate friends, and\r\nabove all his tutor Escoiquiz, were always spurring him on to take some\r\nactive measures against the Prince of the Peace. But Ferdinand was too\r\nindolent and too cautious to move, though he was in his secret heart\r\nconvinced that his enemy was plotting his destruction, and intended to\r\nexclude him from the throne at his father’s death.\r\n\r\n  [23] That Escoiquiz was a clever man, and not the mere intriguer\r\n  that he is often called, is (I think) shown not only by the\r\n  impression which he made upon Napoleon (who called him, in jest,\r\n  _le petit Ximénès_) and on De Pradt at Bayonne, but still more by\r\n  his work, the _Conversation avec Napoléon_. If he invented it,\r\n  he must have been a genius, so well has he caught the Emperor’s\r\n  style; if he only reproduced it he was at least an admirable and\r\n  picturesque reporter.\r\n\r\nTo give a fair idea of the education, character, and brains of this\r\nmiserable prince it is only necessary to quote a couple of his letters.\r\nThe first was written in November, 1807, when he had been imprisoned\r\nby his father for carrying on the famous secret correspondence with\r\nNapoleon. It runs as follows:--\r\n\r\nDEAR PAPA[24],\r\n\r\nI have done wrong: I have sinned against your majesty, both as\r\nking and as father; but I have repented, and I now offer your\r\nmajesty the most humble obedience. I ought to have done nothing\r\nwithout your majesty’s knowledge; but I was caught unawares. I\r\nhave given up the names of the guilty persons, and I beg your\r\nmajesty to pardon me for having lied to you the other night,\r\nand to allow your grateful son to kiss your royal feet.\r\n\r\n  (Signed) FERNANDO.\r\n\r\nSan Lorenzo (The Escurial), Nov. 5, 1807.\r\n\r\n  [24] Observe ‘Papa Mio’ instead of ‘Padre Mio.’ The Spanish text\r\n  I have printed as Appendix 3 of this volume. Some say that Godoy\r\n  dictated the wording of the letter, and did not merely insist\r\n  that a letter of some sort must be written to secure a pardon. In\r\n  any case the terms were such as no self-respecting person could\r\n  have signed. The sentence ‘pido à V. M. me perdone por haberle\r\n  mentido la otra noche,’ the most vile in the whole composition,\r\n  are omitted by the courtly De Pradt when he translates it into\r\n  French.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether the childish whining, the base betrayal of his\r\nunfortunate accomplices, or the slavish tone of the confession forms\r\nthe most striking point in this epistle.\r\n\r\nBut the second document that we have to quote gives an even worse idea\r\nof Ferdinand. Several years after he had been imprisoned by Napoleon\r\nat Valençay, a desperate attempt was made to deliver him. Baron Colli,\r\na daring Austrian officer, entered France, amid a thousand dangers,\r\nwith a scheme for delivering the prince: he hoped to get him to the\r\ncoast, and to an English frigate, by means of false passports and\r\nrelays of swift horses. The unfortunate adventurer was caught and\r\nthrown into a dungeon at Vincennes[25]. After the plot had miscarried\r\nFerdinand wrote as follows to his jailor:--\r\n\r\n‘An unknown person got in here in disguise and proposed to Señor\r\nAmezaga, my master of the horse and steward, to carry me off from\r\nValençay, asking him to pass on some papers, which he had brought, to\r\nmy hands, and to aid in carrying out this horrible undertaking. My\r\nhonour, my repose, and the good opinion due to my principles might all\r\nhave been compromised, if Señor Amezaga had not given proof of his\r\ndevotion to His Imperial Majesty and to myself, by revealing everything\r\nto me at once. I write immediately to give information of the matter,\r\nand take this opportunity of showing anew my inviolable fidelity to the\r\nEmperor Napoleon, and the horror that I feel at this infernal project,\r\nwhose author, I hope, may be chastised according to his deserts.’\r\n\r\n  [25] There is a very black underplot in the story of Baron\r\n  Colli. When he was caught the French police sent a spy with\r\n  his credentials to Valençay, to see how far the persons about\r\n  Ferdinand could be induced to compromise themselves. But the\r\n  prince’s terror, and abject delation of the supposed baron,\r\n  stopped further proceedings.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising to find that the man who was capable of writing\r\nthis letter also wrote more than once to congratulate Joseph Bonaparte\r\non his victories over the ‘rebels’ in Spain.\r\n\r\nIt had been clear for some time that the bitter hatred which the\r\nPrince Royal bore to Godoy, and the fear which the favourite felt\r\nat the prospect of his enemy’s accession to the throne, would lead\r\nto some explosion ere long. If Ferdinand had been a man of ordinary\r\nability and determination he could probably have organized a _coup\r\nd’état_ to get rid of the favourite, without much trouble. But he\r\nwas so slow and timid that, in spite of all the exhortations of his\r\npartisans, he never did more than copy out two letters to his father\r\nwhich Escoiquiz drafted for him. He never screwed up his courage to the\r\npoint of sending them, or personally delivering them into his father’s\r\nhands. They were rhetorical compositions, setting forth the moral and\r\npolitical turpitude of Godoy, and warning the King that his favourite\r\nwas guilty of designs on the throne. If Charles IV had been given them,\r\nhe probably could not have made out half the meaning, and would have\r\nhanded them over for interpretation to the trusty Manuel himself. The\r\nonly other move which the prince was induced to make was to draw out\r\na warrant appointing his friend and confidant, the Duke of Infantado,\r\nCaptain-General of New Castile. It was to be used if the old king, who\r\nwas then labouring under one of his attacks of gout, should chance to\r\nbe carried off by it. The charge of Madrid, and of the troops in its\r\nvicinity, was to be consigned to one whom Ferdinand could trust, so\r\nthat Godoy might be check-mated.\r\n\r\nBut the Prince of the Asturias took one other step in the autumn of\r\n1807 which was destined to bring matters to a head. It occurred to\r\nhim that instead of incurring the risks of conspiracy at home he\r\nwould do better to apply for aid to his father’s all-powerful ally.\r\nIf Napoleon took up his cause, and promised him protection, he would\r\nbe safe against all the machinations of the Prince of the Peace: for\r\na frank and undisguised terror of the Emperor was the mainspring of\r\nGodoy’s foreign and domestic policy. Ferdinand thought that he had a\r\nsure method of enlisting Bonaparte’s benevolence: he was at this moment\r\nthe most eligible _parti_ in Europe: he had lost his first wife, a\r\ndaughter of his uncle of Naples, and being childless was bound to marry\r\nagain[26]. By offering to accept a spouse of the Emperor’s choice he\r\nwould give such a guarantee of future loyalty and obedience that his\r\npatron (who was quite aware of Godoy’s real feelings towards France)\r\nwould withdraw all his support from the favourite and transfer it to\r\nhimself. Acting under the advice of Escoiquiz, with whom he was always\r\nin secret communication, Ferdinand first sounded the French ambassador\r\nat Madrid, the Marquis de Beauharnais, a brother-in-law of the Empress\r\nJosephine. Escoiquiz saw the ambassador, who displayed much pleasure\r\nat his proposals, and urged him to encourage the prince to proceed\r\nwith his plan[27]. The fact was that the diplomatist saw profit to\r\nhis own family in the scheme: for in default of eligible damsels of\r\nthe house of Bonaparte, it was probable that the lady whom the Emperor\r\nmight choose as Queen of Spain would be one of his own relatives--some\r\nBeauharnais or Tascher--a niece or cousin of the Empress. A wife for\r\nthe hereditary prince of Baden had been already chosen from among them\r\nin the preceding year.\r\n\r\n  [26] Godoy had the impudence to propose to the prince that\r\n  he should marry Donna Luisa, the younger sister of his own\r\n  unfortunate wife, and the cousin of the King. Ferdinand found\r\n  courage to refuse this alliance.\r\n\r\n  [27] The intrigues of Escoiquiz had begun as early as March,\r\n  1807, the month in which the letters to the King against Godoy\r\n  were drafted. The negotiation with Beauharnais began in June.\r\n  These dates are strongly against the idea that Bonaparte was at\r\n  the bottom of the whole affair; his hand does not appear till\r\n  July-August. Indeed he was far away in Eastern Germany when\r\n  Escoiquiz began his interviews with the ambassador.\r\n\r\nWhen therefore Escoiquiz broached the matter to the ambassador in June,\r\n1807, the latter only asked that he should be given full assurance\r\nthat the Prince of the Asturias would carry out his design. No private\r\ninterview could be managed between them in the existing state of\r\nSpanish court etiquette, and with the spies of Godoy lurking in every\r\ncorner. But by a prearranged code of signals Ferdinand certified to\r\nBeauharnais, at one of the royal levées, that he had given all his\r\nconfidence to Escoiquiz, and that the latter was really acting in his\r\nname. The ambassador therefore undertook to transmit to his master at\r\nParis any document which the prince might entrust to him. Hence there\r\ncame to be written the celebrated letter of October 11, 1807, in which\r\nFerdinand implored the pity of ‘the hero sent by providence to save\r\nEurope from anarchy, to strengthen tottering thrones, and to give to\r\nthe nations peace and felicity.’ His father, he said, was surrounded\r\nby malignant and astute intriguers who had estranged him from his son.\r\nBut one word from Paris would suffice to discomfit such persons, and\r\nto open the eyes of his loved parents to the just grievances of their\r\nchild. As a token of amity and protection he ventured to ask Bonaparte\r\nfor the hand of some lady of his august house. He does not seem to have\r\nhad any particular one in his eye, as the demand is made in the most\r\ngeneral terms. The choice would really have lain between the eldest\r\ndaughter of Lucien Bonaparte, who was then (as usual) on strained terms\r\nwith his brother, and one of the numerous kinswomen of the Empress\r\nJosephine.\r\n\r\nGodoy was so well served by his numerous spies that the news of the\r\nletter addressed to Bonaparte was soon conveyed to him. He resolved to\r\ntake advantage to the full of the mistake which the prince had made\r\nin opening a correspondence with a foreign power behind the back of\r\nhis father. He contrived an odious scene. He induced the old king to\r\nmake a sudden descent on his son’s apartments on the night of October\r\n27, with an armed guard at his back, to accuse him publicly of aiming\r\nat dethroning or even murdering his parents, and to throw him into\r\nsolitary confinement. Ferdinand’s papers were sequestrated, but there\r\nwas found among them nothing of importance except the two documents\r\ndenouncing Godoy, which the prince had composed or copied out under\r\nthe direction of his adviser Escoiquiz, and a cypher code which was\r\ndiscovered to have belonged to the prince’s late wife, and to have been\r\nused by her in her private letters to her mother, the Queen of Naples.\r\n\r\nThere was absolutely nothing that proved any intention on the part of\r\nFerdinand to commit himself to overt treason, though plenty to show\r\nhis deep discontent, and his hatred for the Prince of the Peace. The\r\nonly act that an honest critic could call disloyal was the attempt to\r\nopen up a correspondence with Napoleon. But Godoy thought that he had\r\nfound his opportunity of crushing the heir to the throne, and even of\r\nremoving him from the succession. He caused Charles IV to publish an\r\nextraordinary manifesto to his subjects, in which he was made to speak\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n‘God, who watches over all creation, does not permit the success of\r\natrocious designs against an innocent victim. His omnipotence has just\r\ndelivered me from an incredible catastrophe. My people, my faithful\r\nsubjects, know my Christian life, my regular conduct: they all love me\r\nand give me constant proof of their veneration, the reward due to a\r\nparent who loves his children. I was living in perfect confidence, when\r\nan unknown hand delated to me the most enormous and incredible plot,\r\nhatched in my own palace against my person. The preservation of my\r\nlife, which has been already several times in danger, should have been\r\nthe special charge of the heir to my throne, but blinded, and estranged\r\nfrom all those Christian principles in which my paternal care and\r\nlove have reared him, he has given his consent to a plot to dethrone\r\nme. Taking in hand the investigation of the matter, I surprised him\r\nin his apartments and found in his hands the cypher which he used\r\nto communicate with his evil counsellors. I have thrown several of\r\nthese criminals into prison, and have put my son under arrest in his\r\nown abode. This necessary punishment adds another sorrow to the many\r\nwhich already afflict me; but as it is the most painful of all, it is\r\nalso the most necessary of all to carry out. Meanwhile I publish the\r\nfacts: I do not hide from my subjects the grief that I feel--which can\r\nonly be lessened by the proofs of loyalty which I know that they will\r\ndisplay’[28] [Oct. 30, 1807].\r\n\r\n  [28] The manuscript of this decree was in the handwriting of\r\n  Godoy himself.\r\n\r\nCharles was therefore made to charge his son with a deliberate plot to\r\ndethrone him, and even to hint that his life had been in danger. The\r\nonly possible reason for the formulating of this most unjustifiable\r\naccusation must have been that Godoy thought that he might now dare to\r\nsweep away the Prince of the Asturias from his path by imprisonment\r\nor exile. There can be no other explanation for the washing in public\r\nof so much of the dirty linen of the palace. Ferdinand, by his craven\r\nconduct, did his best to help his enemy’s designs: in abject fear he\r\ndelated to the King the names of Escoiquiz and his other confidants,\r\nthe dukes of Infantado and San Carlos. He gave full particulars of his\r\nattempt to communicate with Napoleon, and of all his correspondence\r\nwith his partisans--even acknowledging that he had given Infantado that\r\nundated commission as Captain-General of New Castile, to come into\r\neffect when he himself should become king, which we have already had\r\noccasion to mention. This act, it must be owned, was a little unseemly,\r\nbut if it had really borne the sinister meaning that Godoy chose to\r\nput upon it, we may guess that Ferdinand would never have divulged it.\r\nIn addition the prince wrote the disgusting letter of supplication to\r\nhis father which has been already quoted, owning that ‘he had lied the\r\nother night,’ and asking leave to kiss his majesty’s royal feet. It\r\nis beyond dispute that this epistle, with another similar one to the\r\nQueen, was written after a stormy interview with Godoy. The favourite\r\nhad been allowed by his master and mistress to visit Ferdinand in\r\nprison, and to bully him into writing these documents, which (as he\r\nhoped) would ruin the prince’s reputation for ever with every man of\r\nheart and honour. Godoy was wrong here: what struck the public mind far\r\nmore than the prince’s craven tone was the unseemliness of publishing\r\nto the world his miserable letters. That a prince royal of Spain should\r\nhave been terrified by an upstart charlatan like Godoy into writing\r\nsuch words maddened all who read them.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was delighted to see the royal family of Spain putting itself\r\nin such an odious light. He only intervened on a side issue by sending\r\nperemptory orders that in any proceedings taken against the Prince of\r\nthe Asturias no mention was to be made of himself or of his ambassador,\r\ni.e. the matter of the secret appeal to France (the one thing for which\r\nFerdinand could be justly blamed) was not to be allowed to transpire.\r\nIt was probably this communication from Paris which saved Ferdinand\r\nfrom experiencing the full consequences of Godoy’s wrath[29]. If any\r\npublic trial took place, it was certain that either Ferdinand or some\r\nof his friends would speak of the French intrigue, and if the story\r\ncame out Napoleon would be angry. The mere thought of this possibility\r\nso worked upon the favourite that he suddenly resolved to stop the\r\nimpeachment of the prince. In return for his humiliating prayers for\r\nmercy he was given a sort of ungracious pardon. ‘The voice of nature,’\r\nso ran the turgid proclamation which Godoy dictated to the old king,\r\n‘disarms the hand of vengeance; I forgive my son, and will restore\r\nhim to my good graces when his conduct shall have proved him a truly\r\nreformed character.’ Ferdinand was left dishonoured and humiliated: he\r\nhad been accused of intended parricide, made to betray his friends and\r\nto confess plots which he had never formed, and then pardoned. Godoy\r\nhoped that he was so ruined in the eyes of the Spanish people, and\r\n(what was more important) in the eyes of Napoleon, that there would be\r\nno more trouble with him, a supposition in which he grievously erred.\r\nAfter a decent interval the prince’s fellow conspirators, Escoiquiz and\r\nInfantado, were acquitted of high treason by the court before which\r\nthey had been sent, and allowed to go free. Of the dreadful accusations\r\nmade in the Proclamation of Oct. 30 nothing more was heard.\r\n\r\n  [29] Cf. Foy and Toreño, who agree on this point. Napoleon\r\n  insinuates as much in his letter to Ferdinand of April 16, 1808:\r\n  ‘I flatter myself that I contributed by my representations to the\r\n  happy ending of the affair of the Escurial’ (_Nap. Corresp._,\r\n  13,750).\r\n\r\nThe whole of the ‘Affair of the Escurial,’ as the arrest, imprisonment,\r\nand forgiveness of Ferdinand came to be called, took place between the\r\ntwenty-seventh of October and the fifth of November, dates at which\r\nit is pretty certain that Napoleon’s unscrupulous designs against the\r\nroyal house of Spain had long been matured. The open quarrel of the\r\nimbecile father and the cowardly son only helped him in his plans, by\r\nmaking more manifest than ever the deplorable state of the Spanish\r\ncourt. It served as a useful plea to justify acts of aggression which\r\nmust have been planned many months before. If it had never taken place,\r\nit is still certain that Napoleon would have found some other plea for\r\nsweeping out the worthless house of Bourbon from the Peninsula. He\r\nhad begun to collect armies at the roots of the Pyrenees, without any\r\nobvious military necessity, some weeks before Ferdinand was arrested.\r\nWhen that simple fact is taken into consideration we see at once the\r\nhollowness of his plea, elaborated during his exile at St. Helena[30],\r\nthat it was the disgraceful explosion of family hatred in the Spanish\r\nroyal house that first suggested to him the idea of removing the whole\r\ngeneration of Bourbons, and giving Spain a new king and a new dynasty.\r\n\r\n  [30] Las Cases, ii. 206.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be worth while to give, for what it is worth,\r\na story which I find in the _Vaughan Papers_ concerning the\r\ncauses of the final quarrel between Godoy and the Prince of\r\nthe Asturias, ending in the arrest of the latter and the whole\r\n‘Affair of the Escurial.’ Among Vaughan’s large collection\r\nof miscellaneous papers is a long document addressed to him\r\nby one of his Spanish friends, purporting to give the secret\r\nhistory of the rupture; the narrative is said by the author to\r\nhave been obtained from the mouth of the minister Caballero,\r\nwho would certainly have had the best means of gaining court\r\nintelligence in October, 1807. The tale runs as follows: ‘The\r\nQueen had for many years been accustomed to make secret visits\r\nto Godoy’s palace under cover of the dark, escorted only by a\r\nlady-in-waiting and a single body-servant. The sentinels round\r\nthe palace had been designedly so placed that none of them\r\ncovered the postern door by which her majesty was accustomed\r\nto pass in and out. One night in the autumn of 1807 the whole\r\nsystem of the palace-guards was suddenly changed without the\r\nQueen’s knowledge, and when she returned from her excursion\r\nshe ran into the arms of a corporal’s guard placed in front of\r\nthe privy entrance. The men, fortunately for Maria Luisa, did\r\nnot recognize the three muffled figures who fell into their\r\nclutches, and allowed them to buy their way in for an _onza\r\nd’oro_, or gold twenty-dollar piece. But when Godoy and the\r\nQueen talked the matter over, and found that King Charles had\r\nordered the inconvenient alterations in the sentinels, they\r\ncame to the conclusion that Ferdinand had deliberately induced\r\nhis father to change the posts of the guard, with the object\r\neither of stopping his mother’s exits or of making a public\r\nscandal by causing her to be arrested at this strange place and\r\nhour. The Prince chanced to have had a private conversation\r\nwith his father on the previous day, and this might well have\r\nbeen its result.’ In high wrath, the story proceeds, the Queen\r\nand the favourite resolved to crush Ferdinand at once, and\r\nto get him excluded from the succession. They chose the very\r\ninadequate excuse of the letter of the Prince to Napoleon,\r\nof which they had perfect cognizance from the very moment of\r\nits being written. But, we are assured, they were quite wrong\r\nin their suspicions, the originator of the movement of the\r\nsentries, which had so disconcerted them, having been Baron\r\nVersage, the newly appointed colonel of the Walloon Guards.\r\nHe had got the King’s leave to rearrange the watching of the\r\npalace, and going round it had spied the private door, which he\r\nhad blocked with a new picquet, quite unaware of the purpose\r\nfor which it had been used for so many years. This Versage,\r\nit will be remembered, served under Palafox, and was killed\r\nin Aragon during the first year of the war. I should imagine\r\nthe whole tale to be an ingenious fiction, in spite of the\r\nname of Caballero cited in its support: of that personage\r\nNapoleon wrote [_Nap. Corresp._ 14,015] ‘il a une très mauvaise\r\nréputation; c’est tout dire que de dire qu’il était l’homme de\r\nconfiance de la Reine.’ But the story was current in Spain very\r\nsoon after the alleged adventure took place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEST OF PORTUGAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is certainly no example in history of a kingdom conquered in so\r\nfew days and with such small trouble as was Portugal in 1807. That a\r\nnation of three million souls, which in earlier days had repeatedly\r\ndefended itself with success against numbers far greater than those\r\nnow employed against it, should yield without firing a single shot\r\nwas astonishing. It is a testimony not only to the timidity of the\r\nPortuguese Government, but to the numbing power of Napoleon’s name.\r\n\r\nThe force destined by the Treaty of Fontainebleau for the invasion of\r\nPortugal consisted of Junot’s ‘Army of the Gironde,’ 25,000 strong,\r\nand of three auxiliary Spanish corps amounting in all to about the\r\nsame numbers. Of these one, coming from Galicia[31], was to strike at\r\nOporto and the Lower Douro; another, from Badajoz[32], was to take\r\nthe fortress of Elvas, the southern bulwark of Portugal, and then to\r\nmarch on Lisbon by the left bank of the Tagus. These were flanking\r\noperations: the main blow at the Portuguese capital was to be dealt by\r\nJunot himself, strengthened by a third Spanish force[33]; they were to\r\nconcentrate at Salamanca and Ciudad Rodrigo, and make for Lisbon by the\r\nhigh-road that passes by Almeida and Coimbra.\r\n\r\n  [31] Composed of 6,500 men under General Taranco, marching from\r\n  Vigo.\r\n\r\n  [32] Composed of 9,500 men under Solano, Captain-General of\r\n  Andalusia, and marching from Badajoz.\r\n\r\n  [33] Composed of 9,500 men under Caraffa.\r\n\r\nThe Army of the Gironde crossed the Bidassoa on October 18: by the 12th\r\nof November it had arrived at Salamanca, having covered 300 miles in\r\ntwenty-five days--very leisurely marching at the rate of twelve miles\r\na day. The Spaniards would not have been pleased to know that, by\r\nNapoleon’s orders, engineer officers were secretly taking sketches of\r\nevery fortified place and defile that the army passed, and preparing\r\nreports as to the resources of all the towns of Old Castile and Leon.\r\nThis was one of the many signs of the Emperor’s ultimate designs. On\r\nthe 12th of November, in consequence we cannot doubt of the outbreak\r\nof the troubles of October 27 at the Spanish court, Junot suddenly\r\nreceived new orders, telling him to hurry. He was informed that every\r\nday which intervened before his arrival at Lisbon was time granted to\r\nthe Portuguese in which to prepare resistance,--possibly also time in\r\nwhich England, who had plenty of troops in the Mediterranean, might\r\nmake up her mind to send military aid to her old ally. Junot was\r\ndirected to quicken his pace, and to strike before the enemy could\r\nmature plans of defence.\r\n\r\nFor this reason he was told to change his route. The Emperor had\r\noriginally intended to invade the country over the usual line of attack\r\nfrom Spain, by Almeida and Coimbra, which Masséna was to take three\r\nyears later, in 1810. But when the events at the Escurial showed that a\r\ncrisis was impending in Spain, Napoleon changed his mind: there was the\r\nfortress of Almeida in the way, which might offer resistance and cause\r\ndelay, and beyond were nearly 200 miles of difficult mountain roads.\r\nLooking at his maps, Napoleon saw that there was a much shorter way to\r\nLisbon by another route, down the Tagus. From Alcantara, the Spanish\r\nfrontier town on that river, to Lisbon is only 120 miles, and there is\r\nno fortress on the way. The maps could not show the Emperor that this\r\nroad was for half of its length a series of rocky defiles through an\r\nalmost unpeopled wilderness.\r\n\r\nOrders were therefore sent to Junot to transfer his base of operations\r\nfrom Salamanca to Alcantara, and to march down the Tagus. The Spaniards\r\n(according to their orders) had collected the magazines for feeding\r\nJunot’s force at Salamanca and Ciudad Rodrigo. But for that Napoleon\r\ncared little. He wrote that the army must take the shortest road\r\nat all costs, whatever the difficulty of getting supplies. ‘I will\r\nnot have the march of the army delayed for a single day,’ he added;\r\n‘20,000 men can feed themselves anywhere, even in a desert.’ It was\r\nindeed a desert that Junot was ordered to cross: the hill-road from\r\nCiudad Rodrigo to Alcantara, which hugs the Portuguese frontier, has\r\nhardly a village on it; it crosses ridge after ridge, ravine after\r\nravine. In November the rains had just set in, and every torrent was\r\nfull. Over this stony wilderness, by the Pass of Perales, the French\r\narmy rushed in five days, but at the cost of dreadful privations.\r\nWhen it reached Alcantara half the horses had perished of cold, all\r\nthe guns but six had been left behind, stranded at various points on\r\nthe road, and of the infantry more than a quarter was missing--the\r\nfamished men having scattered in all directions to find food. If\r\nthere had been a Portuguese force watching Alcantara, Junot must\r\nhave waited for many days to get his army together again, all the\r\nmore so because every cartridge that his men were carrying had been\r\nspoiled by the wet. But there were no enemies near; Junot found at\r\nthe great Tagus bridge only a few Spanish battalions and guns on the\r\nway to join his army. Confiscating their munitions to fill his men’s\r\npouches, and their food to provide them with two days’ rations, Junot\r\nrushed on again upon the 19th of November. He found, to his surprise,\r\nthat there was no road suitable for wheeled traffic along the Tagus\r\nvalley, but only a poor track running along the foot of the mountains\r\nto Castello Branco, the sole Portuguese town in this part of the\r\nfrontier. The march from Alcantara to Abrantes proved even more trying\r\nthan that from Ciudad Rodrigo to Alcantara. It was through a treeless\r\nwilderness of grey granite, seamed with countless ravines. The rain\r\ncontinued, the torrents were even fuller than before, the country even\r\nmore desolate than the Spanish side of the border. It was only after\r\nterrible sufferings that the head of the column reached Abrantes on\r\nNovember 23: the rear trailed in on the 26th. All the guns except four\r\nSpanish pieces of horse artillery had fallen behind: the cavalry was\r\npractically dismounted. Half the infantry was marauding off the road,\r\nor resting dead-beat in the few poor villages that it had passed. If\r\nthere had been even 5,000 Portuguese troops at Abrantes the French\r\nwould have been brought to a stop. But instead of hostile battalions,\r\nJunot found there only an anxious diplomatist, named Barreto, sent by\r\nthe Prince-Regent to stop his advance by offers of servile submission\r\nto the Emperor and proffers of tribute. Reassured as to the possibility\r\nthat the Portuguese might have been intending armed resistance, Junot\r\nnow took a most hazardous step. Choosing the least disorganized\r\ncompanies of every regiment, he made up four battalions of picked men,\r\nand pushed on again for Lisbon, now only seventy-five miles distant.\r\nThis time he had neither a gun nor a horseman left, but he struggled\r\nforward, and on the 30th of November entered the Portuguese capital at\r\nthe head of 1,500 weary soldiers, all that had been able to endure to\r\nthe end. They limped in utterly exhausted, their clothes in rags, and\r\ntheir cartridges so soaked through that they could not have fired a\r\nshot had they been attacked. If the mob of Lisbon had fallen on them\r\nwith sticks and stones, the starving invaders must have been driven\r\nout of the city. But nothing of the kind happened, and Junot was able\r\nto install himself as governor of Portugal without having to strike\r\na blow. It was ten days before the last of the stragglers came up\r\nfrom the rear, and even more before the artillery appeared and the\r\ncavalry began to remount itself with confiscated horses. Meanwhile\r\nthe Portuguese were digesting the fact that they had allowed 1,500\r\nfamished, half-armed men to seize their capital.\r\n\r\nWhile Junot had been rushing on from Salamanca to Alcantara, and from\r\nAlcantara to Abrantes, Lisbon had been the scene of much pitiful\r\ncommotion. The Prince-Regent had long refused to believe that Napoleon\r\nreally intended to dethrone him, and had been still occupying himself\r\nwith futile schemes for propitiating the Emperor. Of his courtiers\r\nand generals, hardly one counselled resistance: there was no talk of\r\nmobilizing the dilapidated army of some 30,000 men which the country\r\nwas supposed to possess, or of calling out the militia which had done\r\nsuch good service in earlier wars with Spain and France. Prince John\r\ncontented himself with declaring war on England on the twentieth of\r\nOctober, and with garrisoning the coast batteries which protect Lisbon\r\nagainst attacks from the sea. Of these signs of obedience he sent\r\nreports to Napoleon: on the eighth of November he seized the persons of\r\nthe few English merchants who still remained in Portugal; the majority\r\nhad wisely absconded in October. At the same time he let the British\r\nGovernment know that he was at heart their friend, and only driven by\r\nbrute force to his present course: he even permitted their ambassador,\r\nLord Strangford, to linger in Lisbon.\r\n\r\nIn a few days the Regent began to see that Napoleon was inexorable: his\r\nambassador from Paris was sent back to him, and reported that he had\r\npassed on the way the army of Junot marching by Burgos on Salamanca.\r\nPresently an English fleet under Sir Sydney Smith, the hero of Acre,\r\nappeared at the mouth of the Tagus, and declared Lisbon in a state of\r\nblockade--the natural reply to the Regent’s declaration of war and\r\nseizure of English residents. Other reasons existed for the blockade:\r\nthere had lately arrived in the Tagus a Russian squadron on its\r\nhomeward way from the Mediterranean. The Czar Alexander was at this\r\ntime Napoleon’s eager ally, and had just declared war on England;\r\nit seemed wise to keep an eye on these ships, whose arrival appeared\r\nto synchronize in a most suspicious way with the approach of Junot.\r\nMoreover there was the Portuguese fleet to be considered: if the\r\nPrince-Regent intended to hand it over to the French, it would have to\r\nbe dealt with in the same way as the Danish fleet had been treated a\r\nfew months before.\r\n\r\nLord Strangford retired on board Sydney Smith’s flagship, the\r\n_Hibernia_, and from thence continued to exchange notes with the\r\nmiserable Portuguese Government. The Regent was still hesitating\r\nbetween sending still more abject proposals of submission to Bonaparte,\r\nand the only other alternative, that of getting on board his fleet and\r\ncrossing the Atlantic to the great Portuguese colony in Brazil. The\r\nnews that Junot had reached Alcantara only confused him still more; he\r\ncould not make up his mind to leave his comfortable palace at Mafra,\r\nhis gardens, and the countless chapels and shrines in which his soul\r\ndelighted, in order to dare the unaccustomed horrors of the deep. On\r\nthe other hand, he feared that, if he stayed, he might ere long find\r\nhimself a prisoner of state in some obscure French castle. At last\r\nhis mind was made up for him from without: Lord Strangford on the\r\ntwenty-fifth of November received a copy of the Paris _Moniteur_ of the\r\nthirteenth of October, in which appeared a proclamation in the true\r\nNapoleonesque vein, announcing that ‘the house of Braganza had ceased\r\nto reign in Europe.’ The celerity with which the paper had been passed\r\non from Paris to London and from London to Lisbon was most fortunate,\r\nas it was just not too late for the prince to fly, though far too late\r\nfor him to think of defending himself. Junot was already at Abrantes,\r\nbut during the four days which he spent between that place and Lisbon\r\nthe die was cast. Abandoning his wonted indecision, the Regent hurried\r\non shipboard his treasure, his state papers, his insane mother, his\r\nyoung family, and all the hangers-on of his court. The whole fleet,\r\nfifteen men-of-war, was crowded with official refugees and their\r\nbelongings. More than twenty merchant vessels were hastily manned and\r\nfreighted with other inhabitants of Lisbon, who determined to fly with\r\ntheir prince: merchants and nobles alike preferred the voyage to Rio de\r\nJaneiro to facing the dreaded French. On the twenty-ninth of November\r\nthe whole convoy passed out of the mouth of the Tagus and set sail for\r\nthe West. When he toiled in on the thirtieth, Junot found the birds\r\nflown, and took possession of the dismantled city.\r\n\r\nJunot’s Spanish auxiliaries were, as might have been expected from the\r\nnational character and the deplorable state of the government, much\r\nslower than their French allies. Solano and the southern army did not\r\nenter Portugal till the second of December, three days after Lisbon\r\nhad fallen. Taranco and the Galician corps only reached Oporto on the\r\nthirteenth of December. To neither of them was any opposition offered:\r\nthe sole show of national feeling which they met was that the Governor\r\nof Valenza closed his gates, and would not admit the Spaniards till he\r\nheard that Lisbon was in the enemy’s hands, and that the Prince-Regent\r\nhad abandoned the country.\r\n\r\nJunot at first made some attempt to render himself popular and to keep\r\nhis troops in good discipline. But it was impossible to conciliate the\r\nPortuguese: when they saw the exhausted condition and comparatively\r\nsmall numbers of the army that had overrun their realm, they were\r\nfilled with rage to think that no attempt had been made to strike a\r\nblow to save its independence. When, on the thirteenth of December,\r\nJunot made a great show out of the ceremony of hauling down the\r\nPortuguese flag and of hoisting the tricolour on the public buildings\r\nof the metropolis, there broke out a fierce riot, which had to be\r\ndispersed with a cavalry charge. But this was the work of the mob:\r\nboth the civil and the military authorities showed a servile obedience\r\nto Junot’s orders, and no one of importance stood forward to head the\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\nThe first precautionary measure of the French general was to dissolve\r\nthe Portuguese army. He ordered the discharge of all men with less than\r\none and more than six years’ service, dissolved the old regimental\r\n_cadres_, and reorganized the 6,000 or 7,000 men left into nine new\r\ncorps, which were soon ordered out of the realm. Ultimately they\r\nwere sent to the Baltic, and remained garrisoned in Northern Germany\r\nfor some years. At the time of the Russian War of 1812 there were\r\nstill enough of these unhappy exiles left to constitute three strong\r\nregiments. Nearly all of them perished in the snow during the retreat\r\nfrom Moscow.\r\n\r\nFurther endeavour to make French rule popular in Portugal was soon\r\nrendered impossible by orders from Paris. The Emperor’s mandate\r\nnot only bade Junot confiscate and realize all the property of the\r\n15,000 persons, small and great, who had fled to Brazil with the\r\nPrince-Regent; it also commanded him to raise a fine of 100,000,000\r\nfrancs, four millions of our money, from the little kingdom. But the\r\nemigrants had carried away nearly half the coined money in Portugal,\r\nand the rest had been hidden, leaving nothing but coppers and\r\ndepreciated paper money visible in circulation. With the best will in\r\nthe world Junot found it difficult to begin to collect even the nucleus\r\nof the required sum. The heavy taxes and imposts which he levied had\r\nno small effect in adding to the discontent of the people, but their\r\ntotal did little more than pay for the maintenance of the invaders.\r\nMeanwhile the troops behaved with the usual licence of a French army in\r\na conquered country, and repeatedly provoked sanguinary brawls with the\r\npeasantry. Military executions of persons who had resisted requisitions\r\nby force began as early as January, 1808. Nothing was wanting to\r\nprepare an insurrection but leaders: of their appearance there was\r\nno sign; the most spirited members of the upper classes had gone off\r\nwith the Regent. Those who had remained were the miserable bureaucrats\r\nwhich despotic governments always breed. They were ready to serve the\r\nstranger if they could keep their posts and places. A discreditable\r\nproportion of the old state servants acquiesced in the new government.\r\nThe Patriarch of Lisbon issued a fulsome address in praise of Napoleon.\r\nThe members of the provisional government which the Regent had\r\nnominated on his departure mostly submitted to Junot. There was little\r\ndifficulty found in collecting a deputation, imposing by its numbers\r\nand by the names of some of its personnel, which travelled to Bayonne,\r\nto compliment Bonaparte and request him to grant some definite form\r\nof government to Portugal. The Emperor treated them in a very offhand\r\nway, asked them if they would like to be annexed to Spain, and on\r\ntheir indignant repudiation of that proposal, sent them off with a few\r\nplatitudes to the effect that the lot of a nation depends upon itself,\r\nand that his eye was upon them. But this interview only took place in\r\nApril, 1808, when events in Spain were assuming a very different aspect\r\nfrom that which they displayed at the moment of Junot’s first seizure\r\nof Lisbon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I: CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH AGGRESSION IN SPAIN: ABDICATION OF CHARLES IV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ‘Affair of the Escurial’ added some complications to the situation\r\nof affairs in Spain from Napoleon’s point of view. But there was\r\nnothing in it to make him alter the plans which he was at this moment\r\ncarrying out: if the Bourbons were to be evicted from Spain, it\r\nmade the task somewhat easier to find that the heir to the throne\r\nwas now in deep disgrace. It would be possible to urge that by his\r\nparricidal plots he had forfeited any rights to the kingdom which he\r\nhad hitherto possessed. In dealing with the politics of Spain he might\r\nfor the future be disregarded, and there would be no one to take into\r\nconsideration save the King and Queen and Godoy. All three were, as the\r\nEmperor knew, profoundly unpopular: if anything had been needed to make\r\nthe nation more discontented, it was the late scandalous events at the\r\nEscurial. Nothing could be more convenient than that the favourite and\r\nhis sovereigns should sink yet further into the abyss of unpopularity.\r\n\r\nNapoleon therefore went steadily on with his plans for pushing more\r\nand more French troops into Spain, with the object of occupying all\r\nthe main strategical points in the kingdom. The only doubtful point in\r\nhis schemes is whether he ultimately proposed to seize on the persons\r\nof the royal family, or whether he intended by a series of threatening\r\nacts to scare them off to Mexico, as he had already scared the Prince\r\nof Portugal off to Rio de Janeiro. It is on the whole probable that\r\nhe leaned to the latter plan. Every week the attitude of the French\r\narmies became more aggressive, and the language of their master more\r\nhaughty and sinister[34]. The tone in which he had forbidden the court\r\nof Spain to allow any mention of himself or his ambassador to appear,\r\nduring the trial of Prince Ferdinand and his fellow conspirators, had\r\nbeen menacing in the highest degree. After the occupation of Portugal\r\nno further allusion had been made to the project for proclaiming Godoy\r\nPrince of the Algarves. His name was never mentioned either to the\r\nPortuguese or to the officers of Junot. The favourite soon saw that he\r\nhad been duped, but was too terrified to complain.\r\n\r\n  [34] It is impossible to doubt that Napoleon’s scheme was already\r\n  in progress as early as October. On Nov. 13 he sent orders for\r\n  the secret arming and provisioning of all the frontier fortresses\r\n  of France (_Nap. Corresp._, 13,343). On Nov. 24 he directed his\r\n  chamberlain, De Tournon, to spy out the condition of Pampeluna\r\n  and the other Spanish border strongholds, and to discover the\r\n  exact distribution of the Spanish army (13,354). Such moves could\r\n  have but one meaning.\r\n\r\nBut it was the constant influx into Spain of French troops which\r\ncontributed in the most serious way to frighten the Spanish court.\r\nJunot had entered Lisbon on Nov. 30, and the news that he had mastered\r\nthe place without firing a shot had reached the Emperor early in\r\nDecember. But long before, on the twenty-second of November, the French\r\nreserves, hitherto known as the ‘Second Corps of Observation of the\r\nGironde,’ which had been collected at Bayonne in November, crossed the\r\nSpanish frontier. They consisted of 25,000 men--nearly all recently\r\nlevied conscripts--under General Dupont. The treaty of Fontainebleau\r\nhad contained a clause providing that, if the English tried to defend\r\nPortugal by landing troops, Napoleon might send 40,000 men to aid Junot\r\n_after giving due notice to the King of Spain_. Instead of waiting\r\nto hear how the first corps had fared, or apprising his ally of his\r\nintention to dispatch Dupont’s corps across the frontier, the Emperor\r\nmerely ordered it to cross the Bidassoa without sending any information\r\nto Madrid. The fact was that whether the preliminary condition stated\r\nin the treaty, an English descent on Portugal, did or did not take\r\nplace, Bonaparte was determined to carry out his design. A month later\r\nthe Spaniards heard, to their growing alarm, that yet a third army\r\ncorps had come across the border: this was the ‘Corps of Observation\r\nof the Ocean Coast,’ which had been hastily organized under Marshal\r\nMoncey at Bordeaux, and pushed on to Bayonne when Dupont’s troops\r\nmoved forward. It was 30,000 strong, but mainly composed of conscript\r\nbattalions of the levy of 1808, which had been raised by anticipation\r\nin the previous spring, while the Russian war was still in progress. On\r\nthe eighth of January this army began to pass the Pyrenees, occupying\r\nall the chief towns of Biscay and Navarre, while Dupont’s divisions\r\npressed on and cantoned themselves in Burgos, Valladolid, and the\r\nother chief cities of Old Castile. They made no further advance towards\r\nPortugal, where Junot clearly did not require their aid.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish government was terror-stricken at the unexpected appearance\r\nof more than 60,000 French troops on the road to Madrid. If anything\r\nmore was required to cause suspicion, it was the news that still more\r\n‘corps of observation’ were being formed at Bordeaux and Poitiers.\r\nWhat legitimate reason could there possibly be for the direction of\r\nsuch masses of troops on Northern Spain? But any thought of resistance\r\nwas far from the mind of Godoy and the King. Their first plan was to\r\npropitiate Napoleon by making the same request which had brought the\r\nPrince of the Asturias into such trouble in October--that the hand of\r\na princess of the house of Bonaparte might be granted to the heir of\r\nthe Spanish throne. The Emperor was making an ostentatious tour in\r\nItaly while his forces were overrunning the provinces of his ally--as\r\nif the occupation of Castile and Biscay were no affair of his. His\r\nmost important act in November was to evict from Florence the ruling\r\nsovereign, the King of Etruria, and the Regent, his mother, thus\r\nannexing the last surviving Bourbon state save Spain to the French\r\ncrown. He wrote polite but meaningless letters to Madrid, making no\r\nallusion to the boon asked by Charles IV. The fact was that Napoleon\r\ncould now treat Ferdinand as ‘damaged goods’; he was, by his father’s\r\nown avowal, no more than a pardoned parricide, and it suited the policy\r\nof the Emperor to regard him as a convicted criminal who had played\r\naway his rights of succession. If Napoleon visited his brother Lucien\r\nat Mantua, it was not (as was thought at the time) with any real\r\nintention of persuading him to give his daughter to the craven suitor\r\noffered her[35], but in order to tempt her father to accept the crown\r\nof Portugal--even perhaps that of Spain. But Lucien, who always refused\r\nto fall in with Napoleon’s family policy, showed no gratitude for the\r\noffer of a thorny throne in the Iberian Peninsula, and not without\r\nreason, for one of the details of the bargain was to be that he should\r\ndivorce a wife to whom he was fondly attached.\r\n\r\n  [35] Note on this point Talleyrand’s _Mémoires_, i. 333, and\r\n  _Nap. Corresp._, 13,402 (Napoleon to Joseph Bonaparte, Dec. 17,\r\n  1807).\r\n\r\nIt was only after returning from Italy in January that the Emperor\r\ndeigned to answer the King of Spain’s letter, now two months old, in\r\nprecise terms. He did not object to the principle of the alliance,\r\nbut doubted if he could give any daughter of his house to ‘a son\r\ndishonoured by his own father’s declaration.’ This reply was not very\r\nreassuring to Godoy and his master, and worse was to follow. In the\r\nend of January the _Moniteur_, which the Emperor always used as a\r\nmeans for ventilating schemes which were before long to take shape in\r\nfact, began a systematic course of abusing the Prince of the Peace as\r\na bad minister and a false friend. More troops kept pouring across the\r\nPyrenees without any ostensible reason, and now it was not only at\r\nthe western passes that they began to appear, but also on the eastern\r\nroads which lead from Roussillon into Catalonia and Valencia. These\r\nprovinces are so remote from Portugal that it was clear that the army\r\nwhich was collecting opposite them could not be destined for Lisbon.\r\nBut on February 10, 1808, 14,000 men, half French, half Italians, under\r\nGeneral Duhesme, began to drift into Catalonia and to work their way\r\ndown towards its capital--Barcelona. A side-light on the meaning of\r\nthis development was given by Izquierdo, Godoy’s agent at Paris, who\r\nnow kept sending his master very disquieting reports. French ministers\r\nhad begun to sound him as to the way in which Spain would take a\r\nproposal for the cession to France of Catalonia and part of Biscay, in\r\nreturn for Central Portugal. King Charles would probably be asked ere\r\nlong to give up these ancient and loyal provinces, and to do so would\r\nmean the outbreak of a revolution all over Spain.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of February Napoleon finally threw off the mask, and\r\nfrankly displayed himself as a robber in his ally’s abode. On the\r\nsixteenth of the month began that infamous seizure by surprise of the\r\nSpanish frontier fortresses, which would pass for the most odious act\r\nof the Emperor’s whole career, if the kidnapping at Bayonne were not to\r\nfollow. The movement started at Pampeluna: French troops were quartered\r\nin the lower town, while a Spanish garrison held, as was natural, the\r\ncitadel. One cold morning a large party of French soldiers congregated\r\nabout the gate of the fortress, without arms, and pretended to be\r\namusing themselves with snowballing, while waiting for a distribution\r\nof rations. At a given signal many of them, as if beaten in the mock\r\ncontest, rushed in at the gate, pursued by the rest. The first men\r\nknocked down the unsuspecting sentinels, and seized the muskets of the\r\nguard stacked in the arms-racks of the guard-room. Then a company of\r\ngrenadiers, who had been hidden in a neighbouring house, suddenly ran\r\nin at the gate, followed by a whole battalion which had been at drill a\r\nfew hundred yards away. The Spanish garrison, taken utterly by surprise\r\nand unarmed, were hustled out of their quarters and turned into the\r\ntown[36].\r\n\r\n  [36] In _Nap. Corresp._, 13,588, will be found the orders to\r\n  General D’Armagnac to get possession of the citadel by menaces\r\n  if he can, but if he cannot, by the actual use of force. ‘S’il\r\n  arrivait que le commandant-général de Navarre se refusât à rendre\r\n  la citadelle, vous employeriez les troupes du Maréchal Moncey\r\n  pour l’y forcer.’\r\n\r\nA high-spirited prince would have declared war at once, whatever the\r\nodds against him, on receiving such an insulting blow. But this was\r\nnot to be expected from persons like Godoy and Charles IV. Accordingly\r\nthey exposed themselves to the continuation of these odious tricks. On\r\nFebruary 29 General Lecchi, the officer commanding the French troops\r\nwhich were passing through Barcelona, ordered a review of his division\r\nbefore, as he said, its approaching departure for the south. After\r\nsome evolutions he marched it through the city, and past the gate of\r\nthe citadel; when this point was reached, he suddenly bade the leading\r\ncompany wheel to the left and enter the fortress. Before the Spaniards\r\nunderstood what was happening, several thousand of their allies were\r\ninside the place, and by the evening the rightful owners, who carried\r\ntheir opposition no further than noisy protestations, had been evicted.\r\nA few days later the two remaining frontier fortresses of Spain, San\r\nSebastian, at the Atlantic end of the Pyrenees, and Figueras, at the\r\ngreat pass along the Mediterranean coast, suffered the same fate: the\r\nformer place was surrendered by its governor when threatened with an\r\nactual assault, which orders from Madrid forbade him to resist [March\r\n5]. Figueras, on the other hand, was seized by a _coup de main_,\r\nsimilar to that at Pampeluna; 200 French soldiers, having obtained\r\nentrance within the walls on a futile pretext, suddenly seized the\r\ngates and admitted a whole regiment, which turned out the Spanish\r\ngarrison [March 18][37]. It would be hard, if not impossible, to find\r\nin the whole of modern history any incident approaching, in cynical\r\neffrontery and mean cunning, to these first hostile acts of the French\r\non the territory of their allies. The net result was to leave the two\r\nchief fortresses, on each of the main entries into Spain from France,\r\ncompletely in the power of the Emperor.\r\n\r\n  [37] It will hardly be believed that Napier, in his blind\r\n  reverence for Napoleon, omits to give any details concerning the\r\n  seizure of the fortresses, merely saying that they were ‘taken\r\n  by various artifices’ (i. 13). It is the particulars which are\r\n  scandalous as well as the mere fact.\r\n\r\nGodoy and his employers were driven into wild alarm by these acts of\r\nopen hostility. The favourite, in his memoirs[38], tells us that he\r\nthought, for a moment, of responding by a declaration of war, but that\r\nthe old king replied that Napoleon could not be intending treachery,\r\nbecause he had just sent him twelve fine coach-horses and several\r\npolite letters. In face of his master’s reluctance, he tells us that he\r\ntemporized for some days more. The story is highly improbable: Charles\r\nhad no will save Godoy’s, and would have done whatever he was told. It\r\nis much more likely that the reluctance to take a bold resolve was the\r\nfavourite’s own. When the French troops still continued to draw nearer\r\nto Madrid, Godoy could only bethink himself of a plan for absconding.\r\nHe proposed to the King and Queen that they should leave Madrid and\r\ntake refuge in Seville, in order to place themselves as far as possible\r\nfrom the French armies. Behind this move was a scheme for a much longer\r\nvoyage. It seems that he proposed that the court should follow the\r\nexample of the Regent of Portugal, and fly to America. At Mexico or\r\nBuenos Ayres they would at least be safe from Bonaparte. To protect\r\nthe first stage of the flight, the troops in Portugal were directed to\r\nslip away from Junot and mass in Estremadura. The garrison of Madrid\r\nwas drawn to Aranjuez, the palace where the court lay in February and\r\nMarch, and was to act as its escort to Seville. It is certain that\r\nnothing would have suited Napoleon’s plans better than that Charles IV\r\nshould abscond and leave his throne derelict: it would have given the\r\nmaximum of advantage with the minimum of odium. It is possible that the\r\nEmperor was working precisely with the object of frightening Godoy into\r\nflight. If so his scheme was foiled, because he forgot that he had to\r\ndeal not only with the contemptible court, but with the suspicious and\r\nrevengeful Spanish nation. In March the people intervened, and their\r\noutbreak put quite a different face upon affairs.\r\n\r\n  [38] _Memoirs of Godoy_, i. 122. Cf. Arteche, i. 251.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Emperor was launching a new figure upon the stage. On\r\nFebruary 26 his brother-in-law, Joachim Murat, the new Grand-Duke\r\nof Berg, appeared at Bayonne with the title of ‘Lieutenant of the\r\nEmperor,’ and a commission to take command of all the French forces in\r\nSpain. On March 10 he crossed the Bidassoa and assumed possession of\r\nhis post. Murat’s character is well known: it was not very complicated.\r\nHe was a headstrong, unscrupulous soldier, with a genius for heading a\r\ncavalry charge on a large scale, and an unbounded ambition. He was at\r\npresent meditating on thrones and kingdoms: Berg seemed a small thing\r\nto this son of a Gascon innkeeper, and ever since his brothers-in-law\r\nJoseph, Louis, and Jerome Bonaparte had become kings, he was determined\r\nto climb up to be their equal. It has frequently been asserted that\r\nMurat was at this moment dreaming of the Spanish crown: he was\r\ncertainly aware that the Emperor was plotting against the Bourbons, and\r\nthe military movements which he had been directed to carry out were\r\nsufficient in themselves to indicate more or less his brother-in-law’s\r\nintentions. Yet on the whole it is probable that he had not received\r\nmore than half-confidences from his august relative. His dispatches are\r\nfull of murmurs that he was being kept in the dark, and that he could\r\nnot act with full confidence for want of explicit directions. Napoleon\r\nhad certainly promised him promotion, if the Spanish affair came to a\r\nsuccessful end: but it is probable that Murat understood that he was\r\nnot to be rewarded with the crown of Charles IV. Perhaps Portugal, or\r\nHolland, or Naples (if one of the Emperor’s brothers should pass on\r\nto Madrid) was spoken of as his reward. Certainly there was enough at\r\nstake to make him eager to carry out whatever Bonaparte ordered. In his\r\ncheerful self-confidence he imagined himself quite capable of playing\r\nthe part of a Machiavelli, and of edging the old king out of the\r\ncountry by threats and hints. But if grape-shot was required, he was\r\nequally ready to administer an unsparing dose. With a kingdom in view\r\nhe could be utterly unscrupulous[39].\r\n\r\n  [39] That Murat did not dream of the Spanish crown is, I think,\r\n  fairly well demonstrated by his descendant, Count Murat, in his\r\n  useful _Murat, Lieutenant de l’Empereur en Espagne_ (1897). But\r\n  that after once reading the dispatches, _Nap. Corresp._, 13,588\r\n  and 13,589, he failed to see that his brother-in-law’s intention\r\n  was to seize Spain, is impossible.\r\n\r\nOn March 13 Murat arrived at Burgos, and issued a strange proclamation\r\nbidding his army ‘treat the estimable Spanish nation as friends, for\r\nthe Emperor sought only the good and happiness of Spain.’ The curious\r\nphrase could only suggest that unless he gave this warning, his troops\r\nwould have treated their allies as enemies. The scandalous pillage\r\ncommitted by many regiments during February and March quite justified\r\nthe suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe approach of Murat scared Godoy into immediate action, all the\r\nmore because a new _corps d’armée_, more than 30,000 strong, under\r\nMarshal Bessières, was already commencing to cross the Pyrenees,\r\nbringing up the total of French troops in the Peninsula to more than\r\n100,000 men. He ordered the departure of the King and his escort, the\r\nMadrid garrison, for Seville on March 18. This brought matters to a\r\nhead: it was regarded as the commencement of the projected flight to\r\nAmerica, of which rumours were already floating round the court and\r\ncapital. A despotic government, which never takes the people into its\r\nconfidence, must always expect to have its actions interpreted in the\r\nmost unfavourable light. Except Godoy’s personal adherents, there was\r\nnot a soul in Madrid who did not believe that the favourite was acting\r\nin collusion with Napoleon, and deliberately betraying his sovereign\r\nand his country. It was by his consent, they thought, that the French\r\nhad crossed the Pyrenees, had seized Pampeluna and Barcelona, and were\r\nnow marching on the capital. They were far from imagining that of all\r\nthe persons in the game he was the greatest dupe, and that the recent\r\ndevelopments of Napoleon’s policy had reduced him to despair. It was\r\ncorrect enough to attribute the present miserable situation of the\r\nrealm to Godoy’s policy, but only because his servility to Bonaparte\r\nhad tempted the latter to see how far he could go, and because his\r\nmaladministration had brought the army so low that it was no longer\r\ncapable of defending the fatherland. Men did well to be angry with\r\nthe Prince of the Peace, but they should have cursed him as a timid,\r\nincompetent fool, not as a deliberate traitor. But upstarts who guide\r\nthe policy of a great realm for their private profit must naturally\r\nexpect to be misrepresented, and there can be no doubt that the\r\nSpaniards judged Godoy to be a willing helper in the ruin of his master\r\nand his country.\r\n\r\nAranjuez, ordinarily a quiet little place, was now crowded with the\r\nhangers-on of the court, the garrison of Madrid, and a throng of\r\nanxious and distraught inhabitants of the capital: some had come out to\r\navoid the advancing French, some to learn the latest news of the King’s\r\nintentions, others with the deliberate intention of attacking the\r\nfavourite. Among the latter were the few friends of the Prince of the\r\nAsturias, and a much greater number who sympathized with his unhappy\r\nlot and had not gauged his miserable disposition. It is probable\r\nthat as things stood it was really the best move to send the King to\r\nSeville, or even to America, and to commence open resistance to the\r\nFrench when the royal person should be in safety. But the crowd could\r\nsee nothing but deliberate treason in the proposal: they waited only\r\nfor the confirmation of the news of the departure of the court before\r\nbreaking out into violence.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n    DON MANUEL GODOY\r\n    PRINCE OF THE PEACE\r\n    AT THE AGE OF 25]\r\n\r\nOn the night of the seventeenth of March Godoy was actually commencing\r\nthe evacuation of Aranjuez, by sending off his most precious\r\npossession, the too-celebrated Donna Josepha Tudo, under cover of\r\nthe dark. The party which was escorting her fell into the midst of a\r\nknot of midnight loiterers, who were watching the palace. There was a\r\nscuffle, a pistol was fired, and as if by a prearranged plan crowds\r\npoured out into the streets. The cry went round that Godoy was carrying\r\noff the King and Queen, and a general rush was made to his house. There\r\nwere guards before it, but they refused to fire on the mob, of which\r\nno small proportion was composed of soldiers who had broken out of\r\ntheir barracks without leave. In a moment the doors were battered down\r\nand the assailants poured into the mansion, hunting for the favourite.\r\nThey could not find him, and in their disappointment smashed all his\r\nworks of art, and burnt his magnificent furniture. Then they flocked to\r\nthe palace, in which they suspected that he had taken refuge, calling\r\nfor his head. The King and Queen, in deadly terror, besought their\r\nill-used son to save them, by propitiating the mob, who would listen to\r\nhis voice if to no other. Then came the hour of Ferdinand’s triumph;\r\nstepping out on to the balcony, he announced to the crowd that the King\r\nwas much displeased with the Prince of the Peace, and had determined to\r\ndismiss him from office. The throng at once dispersed with loud cheers.\r\n\r\nNext morning, in fact, a royal decree was issued, declaring Godoy\r\nrelieved of all his posts and duties and banished from the court.\r\nWithout the favourite at their elbow Charles and his queen seemed\r\nperfectly helpless. The proclamation was received at first with\r\nsatisfaction, but the people still hung about the palace and kept\r\ncalling for the King, who had to come out several times and salute\r\nthem. It began to look like a scene from the beginning of the French\r\nRevolution. There was already much talk in the crowd of the benefit\r\nthat would ensue to Spain if the Prince of the Asturias, with whose\r\nsufferings every one had sympathized, were to be entrusted with some\r\npart in the governance of the realm. His partisans openly spoke of the\r\nabdication of the old king as a desirable possibility.\r\n\r\nNext day the rioting commenced again, owing to the reappearance of\r\nGodoy. He had lain concealed for thirty-six hours beneath a heap of\r\nmats, in a hiding-place contrived under the rafters of his mansion; but\r\nhunger at last drove him out, and, when he thought that the coast was\r\nclear, he slipped down and tried to get away. In spite of his mantle\r\nand slouched hat he was recognized almost at once, and would have been\r\npulled to pieces by the crowd if he had not been saved by a detachment\r\nof the royal guard, who carried him off a prisoner to the palace. The\r\nnews that he was trapped brought thousands of rioters under the royal\r\nwindows, shouting for his instant trial and execution. The imbecile\r\nKing could not be convinced that he was himself safe, and the Queen,\r\nwho usually displayed more courage, seemed paralysed by her fears\r\nfor Godoy even more than for herself. This was the lucky hour of the\r\nPrince of the Asturias; urged on by his secret advisers, he suggested\r\nabdication to his father, promising that he would disperse the mob and\r\nsave the favourite’s life. The silly old man accepted the proposal with\r\nalacrity, and drew up a short document of twelve lines, to the effect\r\n‘that his many bodily infirmities made it hard for him to support any\r\nlonger the heavy weight of the administration of the realm, and that he\r\nhad decided to remove to some more temperate clime, there to enjoy the\r\npeace of private life. After serious deliberation he had resolved to\r\nabdicate in favour of his natural heir, and wished that Don Ferdinand\r\nshould at once be received as king in all the provinces of the Spanish\r\ncrown. That this free and spontaneous abdication should be immediately\r\npublished was to be the duty of the Council of Castile.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I: CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE TREACHERY AT BAYONNE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news of the abdication of Charles IV was received with universal\r\njoy. The rioters of Aranjuez dispersed after saluting the new\r\nsovereign, and allowed Godoy to be taken off, without further trouble,\r\nto the castle of Villaviciosa. Madrid, though Murat was now almost at\r\nits gates, gave itself up to feasts and processions, after having first\r\nsacked the palaces of the Prince of the Peace and some of his unpopular\r\nrelations and partisans. Completely ignorant of the personal character\r\nof Ferdinand VII, the Spaniards attributed to him all the virtues and\r\ngraces, and blindly expected the commencement of a golden age--as if\r\nthe son of Charles IV and Maria Luisa was likely to be a genius and a\r\nhero.\r\n\r\nLooking at the general situation of affairs, there can be no doubt that\r\nthe wisest course for the young king to have taken would have been to\r\nconcentrate his army, put his person in safety, and ask Napoleon to\r\nspeak out and formulate his intentions. Instead of taking this, the\r\nonly manly course, Ferdinand resolved to throw himself on the Emperor’s\r\nmercy, as if the fall of Godoy had been Napoleon’s object, and not\r\nthe conquest of Spain. Although Murat had actually arrived at Madrid\r\non March 23, with a great body of cavalry and 20,000 foot, the King\r\nentered the city next day and practically put himself in the hands of\r\nthe invader. He wrote a fulsome letter to Napoleon assuring him of his\r\ndevotion, and begging once more for the hand of a princess of his house.\r\n\r\nHis reception in Madrid by the French ought to have undeceived\r\nhim at once. The ambassador Beauharnais, alone among the foreign\r\nministers, refrained from acknowledging him as king. Murat was equally\r\nrecalcitrant, and moreover most rude and disobliging in his language\r\nand behaviour. The fact was that the Grand-Duke had supposed that he\r\nwas entering Madrid in order to chase out Godoy and rule in his stead.\r\nThe popular explosion which had swept away the favourite and the old\r\nking, and substituted for them a young and popular monarch, had foiled\r\nhis design. He did not know how Bonaparte would take the new situation,\r\nand meanwhile was surly and discourteous. But he was determined that\r\nthere should at least be grounds provided for a breach with Ferdinand,\r\nif the Emperor should resolve to go on with his original plan.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, he not only refused to acknowledge the new king’s title,\r\nbut hastened to put himself in secret communication with the dethroned\r\nsovereigns. They were only too eager to meet him halfway, and Maria\r\nLuisa especially was half-mad with rage at her son’s success. At first\r\nshe and her husband thought of nothing but escaping from Spain: they\r\nbegged Murat to pass on to the Emperor letters in which they asked\r\nto be permitted to buy a little estate in France, where they might\r\nenjoy his protection during their declining years. But they begged\r\nalso that ‘the poor Prince of the Peace, who lies in a dungeon covered\r\nwith wounds and contusions and in danger of death,’ might be saved and\r\nallowed to join them, ‘so that we may all live together in some healthy\r\nspot far from intrigues and state business[40].’\r\n\r\n  [40] See the letters of March 22-7 in Toreño, Appendix, i. 436-45.\r\n\r\nMurat saw that the angry old queen might be utilized to discredit her\r\nson, and promised to send on everything to Napoleon. At the first\r\nword of encouragement given by the Grand-Duke’s agent, De Monthion,\r\nMaria Luisa began to cover many sheets with abuse of her son. ‘He is\r\nfalse to the core: he has no natural affection: he is hard-hearted and\r\nnowise inclined to clemency. He has been directed by villains and will\r\ndo anything that ambition suggests: he makes promises, but does not\r\nalways keep them[41].’ Again she writes:--‘From my son we have nothing\r\nto expect but outrages and persecution. He has commenced by forgery,\r\nand he will go on manufacturing evidence to prove that the Prince of\r\nthe Peace--that innocent and affectionate friend of the Emperor, the\r\nDuke of Berg, and every Frenchman!--may appear a criminal in the eyes\r\nof the Spanish people and of Napoleon himself. Do not believe a word\r\nthat he says, for our enemies have the power and means to make any\r\nfalsehood seem true[42].’ In another letter she says that the riots of\r\nAranjuez were no genuine explosion of popular wrath, but a deliberate\r\nplot got up by her son, who spent countless sums on debauching the\r\nsoldiery and importing ruffians from Madrid. He gave the signal for the\r\noutburst himself by putting a lamp in his window at a fixed hour--and\r\nso forth[43].\r\n\r\n  [41] Letter of March 27, in Toreño, Appendix, i. 441.\r\n\r\n  [42] Ibid., p. 436.\r\n\r\n  [43] Letter of March 26 in Toreño, i. 439.\r\n\r\nFinding the Queen in this state of mind, Murat saw his way to dealing a\r\ndeadly blow at Ferdinand: with his counsel and consent Charles IV was\r\ninduced to draw up and send to Bonaparte a formal protest against his\r\nabdication. He was made to declare that his resignation had not been\r\nvoluntary, but imposed on him by force and threats. And so he ‘throws\r\nhimself into the arms of the great monarch who has been his ally, and\r\nputs himself at his disposition wholly and for every purpose[44].’\r\nThis document placed in Napoleon’s hands the precise weapon which\r\nhe required to crush King Ferdinand. If the Emperor chose to take\r\nit seriously, he could declare the new monarch a usurper--almost a\r\nparricide--the legality of whose accession had been vitiated by force\r\nand fraud.\r\n\r\n  [44] The Protest of Charles IV will be found printed in Appendix\r\n  No. 4.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact Bonaparte’s mind had long been made up. The\r\nrevolution of Aranjuez had been a surprise and a disappointment to\r\nhim: his designs against Spain were made infinitely more difficult\r\nof realization thereby. While he had only the weak and unpopular\r\ngovernment of Godoy and Charles IV to deal with, he had fancied that\r\nthe game was in his hands. It had been more than probable that the\r\nPrince of the Peace would take fright, and carry off the King and\r\nQueen to America--in which case he would, as it were, find Spain left\r\nderelict. If, however, the emigration did not take place, and it\r\nbecame necessary to lay hands on Charles and his favourite, Napoleon\r\ncalculated that the Spaniards would be more pleased to be rid of Godoy\r\nthan angry to see force employed against him. He was so profoundly\r\nignorant of the character of the nation, that he imagined that a few\r\nhigh-sounding proclamations and promises of liberal reforms would\r\ninduce them to accept from his hands any new sovereign whom he chose to\r\nnominate. It was clear that the accession of a young and popular king\r\nwould make matters far more difficult. It was no longer possible to\r\npose as the deliverer of Spain from the shameful predominance of Godoy.\r\nAny move against Ferdinand must bear the character of an open assault\r\non the national independence of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nBut Bonaparte had gone too far to recede: he had not moved 100,000\r\nmen across the Pyrenees, and seized Pampeluna and Barcelona, merely\r\nin order that his troops might assist at the coronation ceremonies of\r\nanother Bourbon king. In spite of all difficulties he was resolved\r\nto persevere in his iniquitous plan. He would not recognize the new\r\nmonarch, but would sweep him away, and put in his place some member\r\nof his own family. But his chosen instrument was not to be Murat, but\r\none of the Bonapartes. He knew too well the Duke of Berg’s restless\r\nspirit and overweening ambition to trust him with so great a charge\r\nas Spain. And he was right--with only Naples at his back Joachim was\r\npowerful enough to do his master grave harm in 1814. The tool was to\r\nbe one of his own brothers. It was on the night of March 26 that the\r\nnews of the abdication of Charles IV reached him: on the morning of\r\nthe twenty-seventh he wrote to Amsterdam offering Louis Bonaparte the\r\nchance of exchanging the Dutch for the Spanish crown. The proposal was\r\nmade in the most casual form--‘You say that the climate of Holland does\r\nnot suit you. Besides the country is too thoroughly ruined to rise\r\nagain. Give me a categorical answer: if I nominate you King of Spain\r\nwill you take the offer; can I count on you?[45]’ Louis very wisely\r\nrefused the proffered crown: but his weaker brother Joseph, tired of\r\nNaples and its brigands, made no scruples when the same proposal was\r\nlaid before him.\r\n\r\n  [45] _Nap. Corresp._, xvi. 500; see also in _Documents\r\n  historiques, publiés par Louis Bonaparte_ (Paris, 1829), ii. 290.\r\n\r\nThis letter to Louis of Holland having been written on the first\r\nnews of the events at Aranjuez, and four days before Murat began to\r\nsend in his own plans and the letters of protest from the King and\r\nQueen of Spain, it is clear that the Emperor had never any intention\r\nof recognizing Ferdinand, and was only playing with him during the\r\nmonth that followed. It was not in mere caution that Beauharnais, the\r\nambassador, and Murat, the military representative, of France, were\r\nbidden never to address the new sovereign as king but as Prince of the\r\nAsturias, and to act as if Charles IV were still legally reigning until\r\nthey should have specific directions from Paris[46].\r\n\r\n  [46] It is scarcely necessary to say that the letter which\r\n  Napoleon is said to have sent Murat on March 29, and which is\r\n  printed in the _Mémorial de Ste-Hélène_, is (as Lanfrey and\r\n  Count Murat have shown) a forgery composed by Napoleon himself\r\n  long after. It is quite inconsistent with the offer to Louis\r\n  Bonaparte, and with other letters to Murat of the same week.\r\n\r\nThis state of semi-suspended relations lasted for a fortnight, from\r\nFerdinand’s arrival in Madrid on March 24, down to his departure from\r\nit on April 10. They were very uncomfortable weeks for the new king,\r\nwho grew more alarmed as each day passed without a letter from Paris\r\nratifying his title, while French troops continued to pour into Madrid\r\ntill some 35,000 were assembled in it and its suburbs.\r\n\r\nA very few days after his accession Ferdinand was informed that it\r\nwas probable that Napoleon was intending a visit to Madrid, and was\r\nat any rate coming as far as Bayonne. He immediately sent off his\r\neldest brother Don Carlos (the hero of the unhappy wars of 1833-40) to\r\ncompliment his patron, and if necessary to receive him at the frontier\r\n[April 5]. Two days later there appeared in Madrid a new French\r\nemissary, General Savary--afterwards Duke of Rovigo--who purported\r\nto come as Bonaparte’s harbinger, charged with the duty of preparing\r\nMadrid for his arrival. He carried the farce so far that he asked for\r\na palace for the Emperor’s residence, produced trunks of his private\r\nluggage[47], and began to refurnish the apartments granted him. That\r\nhe bore secret orders for Murat we know from the latter’s dispatches,\r\nbut this was only half his task. Napoleon had confided to him verbal\r\ninstructions to lure Ferdinand to come out to meet him in the north\r\nof Spain, among the French armies massed in Biscay and Navarre--if\r\npossible even to get him to Bayonne on French soil. In his St. Helena\r\nmemoirs Napoleon denies this, and Savary in his autobiography also\r\nstates that he did not act the part of tempter or make any promises\r\nto the young king: the journey to Bayonne, he says, was a silly\r\ninspiration of Ferdinand’s own. But neither Bonaparte nor Savary are\r\nwitnesses whom one would believe on their most solemn oath. The former\r\nwe know well: the latter had been one of the persons most implicated\r\nin the shocking murder of the Duc d’Enghien. When we find the Spanish\r\nwitnesses, who conversed with Savary during his short stay in Madrid,\r\nagreeing that the general promised that Napoleon would recognize\r\nFerdinand as king, give him an imperial princess as wife, and take him\r\ninto favour, we need not doubt them. It is not disputed that Savary,\r\nunlike Murat and Beauharnais, regularly addressed his victim by the\r\nroyal title, and it is certain that he started in his company and\r\nacted as his keeper during the journey[48]. The move that he at first\r\nproposed was not a long one: the general said that according to his\r\nadvices the Emperor must be due at Burgos on April 13: it would be time\r\nenough to start to meet him on the tenth. Burgos lies well inside the\r\nfrontiers of Castile, and if it was packed with French troops, so was\r\nMadrid: one place was no more dangerous than the other.\r\n\r\n  [47] It is said that they afterwards turned out to be full of\r\n  smuggled goods, a private speculation of Savary or his underlings.\r\n\r\n  [48] Savary, in his mendacious autobiography, denies that he\r\n  persuaded Ferdinand to start for Bayonne. But he is refuted by\r\n  two contemporary documents. The young king, in his letter of\r\n  adieu to his father, states that Savary has convinced him of the\r\n  necessity of going; while Murat in a dispatch to Bonaparte says\r\n  that ‘Savary has in no small degree contributed to induce the new\r\n  court to quit Madrid’ [April 8].\r\n\r\nExactly how far the perjuries of Savary went, or how far he was\r\napprised of his master’s final intentions, we cannot tell, but it is\r\ncertain that on April 10 he set out from Madrid in the King’s company:\r\nwith them went Escoiquiz, Ferdinand’s clerical confidant, Cevallos\r\nthe minister of foreign affairs, and half a dozen dukes and marquises\r\nchosen from among the King’s old partisans. To administer affairs in\r\nhis absence Ferdinand nominated a ‘Junta’ or council of regency, with\r\nhis uncle Don Antonio, a simple and very silly old man, at its head[49].\r\n\r\n  [49] For Don Antonio’s habits we have on Talleyrand’s authority\r\n  some very curious stories. He spent most of his time of captivity\r\n  at Valençay sitting in the library, mutilating illustrated books\r\n  with his scissors, not to make a scrap-book, but to destroy any\r\n  engravings that sinned against morals or religion!\r\n\r\nOn reaching Burgos, on April 12, the party found masses of French\r\ntroops but no signs of Napoleon. Savary appeared vexed, said that his\r\ncalculation must have been wrong, and got the King to go forward two\r\nmore stages, as far as Vittoria, at the southern foot of the Pyrenees\r\n[April 14]. Here Ferdinand received a note from his brother Don Carlos,\r\nwhom he had sent ahead, saying that Bonaparte had been lingering\r\nat Bordeaux, and was not expected at Bayonne till the fifteenth.\r\nFerdinand, always timid and suspicious, was getting restive: he had\r\nnothing on paper to assure him of Napoleon’s intentions, and began\r\nto suspect Savary’s blandishments. The latter doubted for a moment\r\nwhether he should not have the court seized by the French garrison of\r\nVittoria, but finally resolved to endeavour to get a letter from his\r\nmaster, which would suffice to lure Ferdinand across the frontier. He\r\nwas entrusted with a petition of the same cast that Napoleon had been\r\nin the habit of receiving from his would-be client, full of servile\r\nloyalty and demands for the much-desired Bonaparte princess.\r\n\r\nThe four days during which Savary was absent, while the royal party\r\nremained at Vittoria, were a period of harassing doubt to Ferdinand.\r\nHe was visited by all manner of persons who besought him not to go on,\r\nand especially by Spaniards lately arrived from Paris, who detailed all\r\nthe disquieting rumours which they had heard at the French court. Some\r\nbesought him to disguise himself and escape by night from the 4,000\r\ntroops of the Imperial Guard who garrisoned Vittoria. Others pointed\r\nout that the Spanish troops in Bilbao, which was still unoccupied by\r\nthe French, might be brought down by cross-roads, and assume charge\r\nof the king’s person halfway between Vittoria and the frontier, in\r\nspite of the 600 French cavalry which escorted the cavalcade. Guarded\r\nby his own men Ferdinand might retire into the hills of Biscay. But\r\nto adopt either of the courses proposed to him would have compelled\r\nthe King to come to an open breach with Bonaparte, and for this he had\r\nnot sufficient courage, as long as there was the slightest chance of\r\ngetting safely through his troubles by mere servility.\r\n\r\nOn April 18 Savary reappeared with the expected communication from\r\nBayonne. It was certainly one of the strangest epistles that one\r\nsovereign ever wrote to another, and one of the most characteristic\r\nproducts of Napoleon’s pen. It was addressed to the Prince of the\r\nAsturias, not to the King of Spain, which was an ominous preface.\r\nBut on the other hand the Emperor distinctly stated that ‘he wished\r\nto conciliate his friend in every way, and to find occasion to give\r\nhim proofs of his affection and perfect esteem.’ He added that ‘the\r\nmarriage of your royal highness to a French princess seems conformable\r\nto the interests of my people, and likely to forge new links of union\r\nbetween myself and the house of Bourbon.’ The core of the whole was\r\nthe explicit statement that ‘if the abdication of King Charles was\r\nspontaneous, and not forced on him by the riot at Aranjuez, I shall\r\nhave no difficulty in recognizing your royal highness as King of Spain.\r\nOn these details I wish to converse with your royal highness.’ This was\r\na double-edged saying: Napoleon had in his pocket Charles’s protest,\r\ncomplaining that the abdication had been forced upon him by fears for\r\nhis personal safety: but Ferdinand was not aware of the fact; indeed\r\nhe so little realized his parent’s state of mind that he had written\r\nto him before quitting Madrid in the most friendly terms. If he had\r\nfathomed the meaning of Napoleon’s carefully constructed sentence, he\r\nwould have fled for his life to the mountains.\r\n\r\nThese were the main clauses of Napoleon’s letter, but they are embedded\r\nin a quantity of turgid verbiage, in which we are only uncertain\r\nwhether the hypocrisy or the bad taste is the more offensive. ‘How\r\nperilous is it for kings to permit their subjects to seek justice for\r\nthemselves by deeds of blood! I pray God that your royal highness may\r\nnot experience this for yourself some day! It is not for the interest\r\nof Spain that the Prince of the Peace should be hunted down: he is\r\nallied by marriage to the royal house and has governed the realm for\r\nmany years. He has no friends now: but if your royal highness were to\r\nfall into similar disgrace you would have no more friends than he. You\r\ncannot touch him without touching your parents. You have no rights to\r\nthe crown save those which your mother has transmitted to you: if in\r\ntrying the Prince you smirch her honour, you are destroying your own\r\nrights. You have no power to bring him to judgement: his evil deeds are\r\nhidden behind the throne.... O wretched Humanity! Weakness, and Error,\r\nsuch is our device! But all can be hushed up: turn the Prince out of\r\nSpain, and I will give him an asylum in France.’\r\n\r\nIn the next paragraph Napoleon tells Ferdinand that he should never\r\nhave written to him in the preceding autumn without his father’s\r\nknowledge--‘in that your royal highness was culpable; but I flatter\r\nmyself that I contributed by my remonstrances in securing a happy end\r\nto the affair of the Escurial.’ Finally Ferdinand might assure himself\r\nthat he should have from his ally precisely the same treatment that his\r\nfather had always experienced--which again is a double-edged saying, if\r\nwe take into consideration the history of the relations of Charles IV\r\nand France.\r\n\r\nThe King and his confidant Escoiquiz read and reread this curious\r\ndocument without coming to any certain conclusion: probably they\r\nthought (as would any one else who did not know the Emperor thoroughly)\r\nthat the meeting at Bayonne would open with a scolding, and end\r\nwith some tiresome concessions, but that Ferdinand’s title would be\r\nrecognized. Savary’s commentary was reassuring: Spanish witnesses say\r\nthat he exclaimed ‘I am ready to have my head taken off if, within a\r\nquarter of an hour of your majesty’s arrival at Bayonne, the Emperor\r\nhas not saluted you as King of Spain and the Indies.... The whole\r\nnegotiation will not take three days, and your majesty will be back in\r\nSpain in a moment[50].’\r\n\r\n  [50] Cevallos, p. 36.\r\n\r\nOn April 19, therefore, the royal party set out amid the groans of\r\nthe populace of Vittoria, who tried to hold back the horses, and to\r\ncut the traces of the King’s coach: on the twentieth they reached\r\nBayonne. Napoleon entertained them at dinner, but would not talk\r\npolitics: after the meal they were sent home to the not very spacious\r\nor magnificent lodgings prepared for them. An hour later the shameless\r\nSavary presented himself at the door, with the astounding message that\r\nthe Emperor had thought matters over, and had come to the conclusion\r\nthat the best thing for Spain would be that the house of Bourbon should\r\ncease to reign, and that a French prince should take their place. A\r\nprompt acquiescence in the bargain should be rewarded by the gift of\r\nthe kingdom of Etruria, which had just been taken from Ferdinand’s\r\nwidowed sister and her young son.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of such an outrage had never occurred to the young king\r\nand his counsellors: when something of the kind had been suggested\r\nto them at Vittoria, they had cried out that it was insulting to the\r\nhonour of the greatest hero of the age to dream that he could be\r\nplotting treachery[51]. And now, too late, they learnt the stuff of\r\nwhich heroes were made. Even with Savary’s words ringing in their ears,\r\nthey could not believe that they had heard aright. It must be some mere\r\nthreat intended to frighten them before negotiations began: probably\r\nit meant that Spain would have to cede some American colonies or some\r\nCatalonian frontier districts. Next morning, therefore, Ferdinand sent\r\nhis minister Cevallos to plead his cause: Napoleon refused to bargain\r\nor compromise: he wanted nothing, he said, but a prompt resignation\r\nof his rights by the Prince of the Asturias: there was nothing left\r\nto haggle about. It was gradually borne in upon Ferdinand that the\r\nEmperor meant what he had said. But though timid he was obstinate,\r\nand nothing like an abdication could be got out of him. He merely\r\ncontinued to send to Napoleon one agent after another--first the\r\nminister Cevallos, then his tutor and confidant Escoiquiz, then Don\r\nPedro Labrador, a councillor of state, all charged with professions\r\nof his great readiness to do anything, short of resigning the Spanish\r\nthrone, which might satisfy his captor. Cevallos and Escoiquiz have\r\nleft long narratives of their fruitless embassies. That of the latter\r\nis especially interesting: he was admitted to a long conference with\r\nBonaparte, in which he plied every argument to induce him to leave\r\nFerdinand on the throne, after marrying him to a French princess and\r\nexacting from him every possible guarantee of fidelity. The Emperor\r\nwas ready to listen to every remonstrance, but would not move from\r\nhis projects. He laughed at the idea that Spain would rise in arms,\r\nand give him trouble. ‘Countries full of monks, like yours,’ he said,\r\n‘are easy to subjugate. There may be some riots, but the Spaniards\r\nwill quiet down when they see that I offer them the integrity of\r\nthe boundaries of the monarchy, a liberal constitution, and the\r\npreservation of their religion and their national customs[52].’\r\n\r\n  [51] It was the Duke of Infantado who made this exclamation. See\r\n  Urquijo’s letter to Cuesta in Llorente’s collection of papers on\r\n  the Bayonne business.\r\n\r\n  [52] Escoiquiz, p. 318. Every student of Napoleon should read the\r\n  whole of the wonderful dialogue between the Emperor and the Canon\r\n  of Toledo.\r\n\r\nWhen such were Napoleon’s ideas it was useless to argue with him. But\r\nFerdinand refused to understand this, and kept reiterating all sorts\r\nof impracticable offers of concession and subservience, while refusing\r\nto do the one thing which the Emperor required of him. Napoleon, much\r\nirritated at the refusal of such a poor creature to bow to his will,\r\nhas left a sketch of him during these trying days. ‘The Prince of the\r\nAsturias,’ he wrote, ‘is very stupid, very malicious, a very great\r\nhater of France.... He is a thoroughly uninteresting person, so dull\r\nthat I cannot get a word out of him. Whatever one says to him he makes\r\nno reply. Whether I scold him, or whether I coax him, his face never\r\nmoves. After studying him you can sum him up in a single word--he is a\r\nsulky fellow[53].’\r\n\r\n  [53] Napoleon to Talleyrand, May 6, 1808.\r\n\r\nAs Ferdinand would not budge, Bonaparte had now to bring his second\r\ndevice to the front. With the old king’s protest before him, the\r\nEmperor could say that Charles IV had never abdicated in any real sense\r\nof the word. He had been made to sign a resignation ‘with a pistol\r\nlevelled at his head,’ as a leading article in the _Moniteur_ duly\r\nset forth. Such a document was, of course, worth nothing: therefore\r\nCharles was still King of Spain, and might sign that surrender of\r\nhis rights which Ferdinand denied. Napoleon promptly sent for the old\r\nking and queen, who arrived under a French escort on April 30, ten\r\ndays after their son’s captivity began. At Bayonne they rejoined their\r\ndearly-loved Godoy, whom Murat had extorted from the Junta of Regency,\r\nunder cover of a consent sent by Ferdinand to Napoleon from Vittoria\r\ntwo days before he crossed the frontier.\r\n\r\nCharles IV arrived in a state of lachrymose collapse, sank on\r\nNapoleon’s breast and called him his true friend and his only support.\r\n‘I really do not know whether it is his position or the circumstances,\r\nbut he looks like a good honest old man,’ commented the Emperor. ‘The\r\nQueen has her past written on her face--that is enough to define her.\r\nAs to the Prince of the Peace, he looked like a prize bull, with a dash\r\nof Count Daru about him.’ Godoy and the Queen had only one thought, to\r\navenge themselves on Ferdinand: after what had taken place they could\r\nnever go back to rule in Spain, so they cared little what happened to\r\nthe country. As to the King, his wife and his favourite pulled the\r\nstrings, and he gesticulated in the fashion that they desired. The\r\nEmperor treated them with an ostentatious politeness which he had\r\nalways refused to the new king: at the first banquet that he gave them\r\noccurred the absurd scene (already mentioned by us), in which Charles\r\nrefused to sit down to table till Godoy had been found and put near him.\r\n\r\nTwo days after their arrival Napoleon compelled Ferdinand to appear\r\nbefore his parents: he himself was also present. The interview[54]\r\ncommenced by King Charles ordering his son to sign a complete and\r\nabsolute renunciation of the Spanish throne. Bonaparte then threw in\r\na few threatening words: but Ferdinand, still unmoved, made a steady\r\nrefusal. At this the old king rose from his chair--he was half-crippled\r\nwith rheumatism--and tried to strike his son with his cane, while the\r\nQueen burst in with a stream of abuse worthy of a fishwife. Napoleon,\r\nhorrified at the odious scene, according to his own narrative of it,\r\nhurried Ferdinand, ‘who looked scared,’ out of the room.\r\n\r\n  [54] Of this interview we have the version of Napoleon himself\r\n  in a dispatch to Murat, dated May 1; another by Cevallos,\r\n  Ferdinand’s minister; a third by De Pradt (afterwards Archbishop\r\n  of Mechlin), then present at Bayonne.\r\n\r\nThe same night [May 1], Ferdinand’s advisers bethought them of a new\r\nand ingenious move--we need not ascribe it to his own brains, which\r\nwere surely incapable of the device. He wrote to King Charles to the\r\neffect that he had always regarded the abdication at Aranjuez as free\r\nand unconstrained, but that if it had not been so, he was ready to lay\r\ndown his crown again and hand it back to his father. But the ceremony\r\nmust be done in an open and honourable way at Madrid, before the\r\nCortes. If his parent personally resumed the reins of power, he bowed\r\nto his authority: but if his age and infirmities induced him to name a\r\nregent, that regent should be his eldest son.\r\n\r\nThis proposal did not suit the Emperor at all, so he dictated to the\r\nold king a long letter, in which the Napoleonesque phraseology peeps\r\nout in a score of places. Charles refuses all terms, says that his\r\nson’s conduct had ‘placed a barrier of bronze between him and the\r\nSpanish throne,’ and concludes that ‘only the Emperor can save Spain,\r\nand he himself would do nothing that might stir up the fire of discord\r\namong his loved vassals or bring misery on them’ [May 2]. Ferdinand\r\nreplied with an equally long letter justifying at large all his conduct\r\nof the past year [May 4].\r\n\r\nWhen things stood at this point there arrived from Madrid the news of\r\nthe bloody events of the second of May, which we have to relate in the\r\nnext chapter. This brought Napoleon up to striking point, and once\r\nmore he intervened in his own person. He sent for Ferdinand, and in\r\nthe presence of his parents accused him of having stirred up the riot\r\nin the capital, and informed him that if he did not sign an abdication\r\nand an acknowledgement of his father as the only true king by twelve\r\nthat night ‘he should be dealt with as a traitor and rebel.’ This is\r\nNapoleon’s own version[55], but Spanish witnesses say that the words\r\nused were that ‘he must choose between abdication and death[56].’\r\n\r\n  [55] Dispatch to Murat of May 5.\r\n\r\n  [56] ‘Prince, il faut opter entre la cession et la mort’\r\n  (Cevallos, p. 60).\r\n\r\nTo any one who remembered the fate of the Duc d’Enghien such a phrase\r\nwas more than an idle threat. It brought the stubborn Ferdinand to his\r\nknees at last. That evening he wrote out a simple and straightforward\r\nform of abdication--‘without any motive, save that I limited my former\r\nproposal for resignation by certain proper conditions, your majesty has\r\nthought fit to insult me in the presence of my mother and the Emperor.\r\nI have been abused in the most humiliating terms: I have been told\r\nthat unless I make an unconditional resignation I and my companions\r\nshall be treated as criminals guilty of conspiracy. Under such\r\ncircumstances I make the renunciation which your majesty commands, that\r\nthe government of Spain may return to the condition in which it was on\r\nMarch 19 last, the day on which your majesty _spontaneously_ laid down\r\nyour crown in my favour[57]’ [May 6].\r\n\r\n  [57] Toreño, Appendix, i. 466, 467.\r\n\r\nFerdinand having abdicated, Napoleon at once produced a treaty which\r\nKing Charles had ratified on the previous day, twenty-four hours before\r\nhis son gave in. By it the old man ‘resigned all his rights to the\r\nthrone of Spain and the Indies to the Emperor Napoleon, the only person\r\nwho in the present state of affairs can re-establish order.’ He only\r\nannexed two conditions: ‘(1) that there should be no partition of the\r\nSpanish monarchy; (2) that the Roman Catholic religion should be the\r\nonly one recognized in Spain: there should, according to the existing\r\npractice, be no toleration for any of the reformed religions, much less\r\nfor infidels.’ If anything is wanting to make the silly old man odious,\r\nit is the final touch of bigotry in his abdication. The rest of the\r\ndocument consists of a recital of the pensions and estates in France\r\nconferred by the Emperor on his dupe in return for the abdication.\r\nIt took five days more to extort from Don Ferdinand a formal cession\r\nof his ultimate rights, as Prince of the Asturias, to the succession\r\nto the throne. It was signed on May 10, and purported to give him in\r\nreturn a palace in France and a large annual revenue. But he was really\r\nput under close surveillance at Talleyrand’s estate of Valençay, along\r\nwith his brother Don Carlos, and never allowed to go beyond its bounds.\r\nThe Emperor’s letter of instructions to Talleyrand is worth quoting\r\nfor its cynical brutality. He wrote to his ex-minister, who was much\r\ndisgusted with the invidious duty put upon him: ‘Let the princes be\r\nreceived without any show, but yet respectably, and try to keep them\r\namused. If you chance to have a theatre at Valençay there would be no\r\nharm in importing some actors now and then. You may bring over Mme de\r\nTalleyrand [the notorious Mme Grand of 1800], and four or five ladies\r\nin attendance on her. If the prince should fall in love with some\r\npretty girl among them, there would be no harm in it, especially if you\r\nare quite sure of her. The prince must not be allowed to take any false\r\nstep, but must be amused and occupied. I ought, for political safety,\r\nto put him in Bitche or some other fortress-prison: but as he placed\r\nhimself into my clutches of his own free will, and as everything in\r\nSpain is going on as I desire, I have resolved merely to place him in a\r\ncountry house where he can amuse himself under strict surveillance....\r\nYour mission is really a very honourable one--to take in three[58]\r\nillustrious guests and keep them amused is a task which should suit a\r\nFrenchman and a personage of your rank[59].’ Napoleon afterwards owned\r\nthat he was framing what he called ‘a practical joke’ on Talleyrand, by\r\nbilleting the Spaniards on him. The Prince of Benevento had wished to\r\nmake no appearance in the matter, and the Emperor revenged himself by\r\nimplicating him in it as the jailor of his captives. Talleyrand’s anger\r\nmay be imagined, and estimated by his after conduct.\r\n\r\n  [58] The _third_ prisoner was Ferdinand’s uncle, Don Antonio.\r\n\r\n  [59] This letter, eliminated by the editors of the\r\n  _Correspondance de Napoléon_, may be found in Lecestre, _Lettres\r\n  inédites de Napoléon I_, i. p. 207.\r\n\r\nAt Valençay the unfortunate Ferdinand was destined to remain for nearly\r\nsix years, not amusing himself at all according to Napoleon’s ideas\r\nof amusement, but employed in a great many church services, a little\r\npartridge shooting, and (so his unwilling jailor tells us) the spoiling\r\nof much paper, not with the pen but with the scissors; for he developed\r\na childish passion for clipping out paper patterns and bestowing them\r\non every one that he met. One could pardon him everything if he had\r\nnot spoilt his attitude as victim and martyr by occasionally sending\r\nadulatory letters to the Emperor, and even to his own supplanter,\r\nJoseph Bonaparte the new King of Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I: CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND OF MAY: OUTBREAK OF THE SPANISH INSURRECTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen King Ferdinand had taken his departure to Bayonne, the position\r\nof Murat in Madrid became very delicate. He might expect to hear at\r\nany moment, since the Emperor’s plans were more or less known to him,\r\neither that the Spanish king had been made a prisoner, or that he had\r\ntaken the alarm, escaped from his escort, and fled into the mountains.\r\nIn either case trouble at Madrid was very probable, though there was\r\nno serious military danger to be feared, for of Spanish troops there\r\nwere only 3,000 in the city, while some 35,000 French were encamped in\r\nor about it. But there might be a moment of confusion if the Junta of\r\nRegency should take violent measures on hearing of the King’s fate,\r\nor the populace of Madrid (and this was much more likely) burst into\r\nrioting.\r\n\r\nFrom the tenth of April, the day of the King’s departure for the north,\r\ndown to the twenty-ninth there was no serious cause for apprehension.\r\nThe people were no doubt restless: they could not understand why the\r\nFrench lingered in Madrid instead of marching on Portugal or Gibraltar,\r\naccording to their expressed intention. Rumours of all kinds, some\r\nof which hit off fairly well the true projects of Bonaparte, were\r\ncurrent. Murat’s conduct was not calculated to reassure observers;\r\nhe gave himself the airs of a military governor, rather than those\r\nof an officer engaged in conducting an allied army through friendly\r\nterritory. Some of his acts gave terrible offence, such as that of\r\ninsisting that the sword of Francis I, taken at Pavia in 1525, the\r\npride for three centuries of the royal armoury, should be given up to\r\nhim[60]. His call on the Junta for the surrender of the Prince of\r\nthe Peace, whom he forwarded under French escort to Bayonne, could\r\nnot fail to be unpopular. But the first real signs of danger were\r\nnot seen till the twenty-second of April, when Murat, in obedience\r\nto his master, intended to publish the protest of Charles IV against\r\nhis abdication. It was to be presented to the Junta in the form of a\r\nletter to its president, Don Antonio. Meanwhile French agents were\r\nset to print it: their Spanish underlings stole and circulated some\r\nof the proofs. Their appearance raised a mob, for the name of Charles\r\nIV could only suggest the reappearance of Godoy. An angry crowd broke\r\ninto the printing office, destroyed the presses, and hunted away the\r\nFrenchmen. Murat at once made a great matter of the affair, and began\r\nto threaten the Junta. ‘The army which he commanded could not without\r\ndishonouring itself allow disorders to arise: there must be no more\r\nanarchy in Spain. He was not going to allow the corrupt tools of the\r\nEnglish government to stir up troubles.’ The Junta replied with rather\r\nmore spirit than might have been expected, asked why an army of 35,000\r\nFrench troops had now lingered more than a month around the capital,\r\nand expressed an opinion that the riot was but an explosion of loyalty\r\nto Ferdinand. But they undertook to deal severely with factious\r\npersons, and to discourage even harmless assemblies like that of the\r\ntwenty-second.\r\n\r\n  [60] Napoleon, disapproving of Murat’s action on this point,\r\n  committed himself to two astounding historical statements. ‘Why\r\n  trouble about the sword,’ he wrote; ‘Francis I was a Bourbon [!]\r\n  and he was taken by the Italians, not the Spaniards’ [!!] (_Nap.\r\n  Corresp._, 13,724).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Murat wrote to the Emperor that it was absurd that he could\r\nnot yet establish a police of his own in Madrid, that he could not\r\nprint what he pleased, and that he had to negotiate with the Junta when\r\nhe wished his orders published, instead of being able to issue them\r\non his own authority[61]. He was answered in a style which must have\r\nsurprised him. Napoleon was ashamed, he said, of a general who, with\r\n50,000 men at his back, asked for things instead of taking them. His\r\nletters to the Junta were servile; he should simply assume possession\r\nof the reins of power, and act for himself. If the _canaille_ stirred,\r\nlet it be shot down[62]. Murat could only reply that ‘if he had not yet\r\nscattered rioters by a blast of grape, it was only because there were\r\nno mobs to shoot: his imperial majesty’s rebuke had stunned him “like a\r\ntile falling on his head” by its unmerited severity[63].’\r\n\r\n  [61] Murat to Napoleon, April 22.\r\n\r\n  [62] Napoleon to Murat, April 26.\r\n\r\n  [63] Murat to Napoleon, April 30.\r\n\r\nWithin three days of this letter there was to be plenty of grape-shot,\r\nenough to satisfy both Emperor and Grand-Duke. They probably had the\r\nrevolt of Cairo and the 13th Vendémiaire in their mind, and were\r\nboth under the impression that a good _émeute_ pitilessly crushed by\r\nartillery was the best basis of a new régime.\r\n\r\nOn the night of April 29 the first clear and accurate account of what\r\nwas happening at Bayonne arrived at Madrid. Napoleon had intercepted\r\nall the letters which Don Ferdinand had tried to smuggle out of his\r\nprison. He read them with grave disapproval, for his guest had not\r\nscrupled to use the expression ‘the cursed French,’ and had hinted at\r\nthe propriety of resistance. He had not yet been cowed by the threat\r\nof a rebel’s death. But on the twenty-third one of the Spaniards at\r\nBayonne succeeded in escaping in disguise, crossed the mountains by a\r\nlonely track, and reached Pampeluna, whence he posted to Madrid. This\r\nwas a certain Navarrese magistrate named Ibarnavarro, to whom Ferdinand\r\nhad given a verbal message to explain Napoleon’s plans and conduct\r\nto the Junta, and to inform them that he would never give in to this\r\nvile mixture of force and fraud. He could not send them any definite\r\ninstructions, not knowing the exact state of affairs at Madrid, and a\r\npremature stroke might imperil the life of himself, his brother, and\r\nhis companions: let them beware therefore of showing their warlike\r\nintentions till preparations had been fully made to shake off the yoke\r\nof the oppressor.\r\n\r\nThis message Ibarnavarro delivered on the night of April 29-30 to the\r\nJunta[64], who had summoned in to hear it a number of judges and other\r\nmagnates of the city. Next morning, of course, the information, in a\r\nmore or less garbled shape, spread all round Madrid: there were foolish\r\nrumours that the Biscayans had already taken arms, and that 30,000 of\r\nthem were marching on Bayonne to save the King, as also that certain\r\nof the coast towns had invited the English to land. On the thirtieth\r\nleaflets, both written and printed, were being secretly circulated\r\nround the city, setting forth the unhappy condition of the King, and\r\nbidding his subjects not to forget Numancia[65]. It is astonishing that\r\nriots did not break out at once, considering the growing excitement\r\nof the people, and the habitual insolence of the French soldiery.\r\nBut leaders were wanting, and in especial the Junta of Regency and\r\nits imbecile old president made no move whatever, on the pretext,\r\napparently, that any commotion might imperil the lives of Napoleon’s\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n  [64] Ibarnavarro’s story, written down by himself on September\r\n  27, 1808, can be found printed in full on pp. 457-9 of the\r\n  Appendix to Toreño’s first volume.\r\n\r\n  [65] For a specimen see the document on p. 462 of Count Murat’s\r\n  _Murat en Espagne_ (Paris, 1897).\r\n\r\nIt was Murat himself who brought matters to a head next day, by\r\nordering the Junta to put into his hands the remaining members of the\r\nroyal family, Ferdinand’s youngest brother Don Francisco, a boy of\r\nsixteen, and his sister the widowed and exiled Queen of Etruria, with\r\nher children. Only Don Antonio, the incapable president of the Junta,\r\nand the Archbishop of Toledo, the King’s second-cousin, were to be left\r\nbehind: the rest were to be sent to Bayonne. Knowing what had happened\r\nto Don Ferdinand and Don Carlos, the people were horrified at the\r\nnews; but they trusted that the Regency would refuse its leave. To its\r\neternal disgrace that body did nothing: it did not even try to smuggle\r\naway the young Don Francisco before Murat should arrest him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Madrid in 1808.]\r\n\r\nOn the morning, therefore, of May 2 the streets were filled with\r\npeople, and the palace gates in especial were beset by an excited mob.\r\nIt was soon seen that the news was true, for the Queen of Etruria\r\nappeared and started for the north with all her numerous family. She\r\nwas unpopular for having sided with her mother and Godoy against Don\r\nFerdinand, and was allowed to depart undisturbed. But when the carriage\r\nthat was to bear off Don Francisco was brought up, and one of Murat’s\r\naides-de-camp appeared at the door to take charge of the young prince,\r\nthe rage of the crowd burst all bounds. The French officer was stoned,\r\nand saved with difficulty by a patrol: the coach was torn to pieces.\r\nMurat had not been unprepared for something of the kind: the battalion\r\non guard at his palace was at once turned out, and fired a dozen\r\nvolleys into the unarmed mob, which fled devious, leaving scores of\r\ndead and wounded on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe Grand-Duke thought that the matter was over, but it had but just\r\nbegun. At the noise of the firing the excited citizens flocked into\r\nthe streets armed with whatever came to hand, pistols, blunderbusses,\r\nfowling-pieces, many only with the long Spanish knife. They fell upon,\r\nand slew, a certain number of isolated French soldiers, armed and\r\nunarmed, who were off duty and wandering round the town, but they also\r\nmade a fierce attack on Murat’s guard. Of course they could do little\r\nagainst troops armed and in order: in the first hour of the fight there\r\nwere only about 1,000 men at the Grand-Duke’s disposal, but this small\r\nforce held its own without much loss, though eight or ten thousand\r\nangry insurgents fell upon them. But within seventy minutes the French\r\narmy from the suburban camps came pouring into the city, brigade after\r\nbrigade. After this the struggle was little more than a massacre: many\r\nof the insurgents took refuge in houses, and maintained a fierce but\r\nfutile resistance for some time; but the majority were swept away in a\r\nfew minutes by cavalry charges. Only at one point did the fight assume\r\na serious shape. Almost the entire body of the Spanish garrison of\r\nMadrid refrained from taking any part in the rising: without the orders\r\nof the Junta the chiefs refused to move, and the men waited in vain for\r\nthe orders of their officers. But at the Artillery Park two captains,\r\nDaoiz and Velarde, threw open the gates to the rioters, allowed them\r\nto seize some hundreds of muskets, and when the first French column\r\nappeared ran out three guns and opened upon it with grape[66]. Though\r\naided by no more than forty soldiers, and perhaps 500 civilians,\r\nthey beat off two assaults, and only succumbed to a third. Daoiz was\r\nbayonetted, Velarde shot dead, and their men perished with them; but\r\nthey had poured three volleys of grape into a street packed with the\r\nenemy, and caused the only serious losses which the French suffered\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\n  [66] Napier (i. 15) says that Daoiz and Velarde were ‘in a state\r\n  of excitement from drink,’ a disgraceful French calumny. How\r\n  could he bear to reproduce such a libel on these unfortunate\r\n  officers?\r\n\r\nThe whole struggle had occupied not more than four hours: when it was\r\nover Murat issued an ‘order of the day,’ sentencing all prisoners taken\r\nwith arms in their hands, all persons discovered with arms concealed\r\nin their houses, and all distributors of seditious leaflets, ‘the\r\nagents of the English government,’ to be shot. It seems that at least a\r\nhundred persons were executed under this edict, many of them innocent\r\nbystanders who had taken no part in the fighting. Next morning Murat\r\nwithdrew his Draconian decree, and no further fusillades took place.\r\nIt is impossible, in the conflict of authorities, to arrive at any\r\nclear estimate of the numbers slain on each side on May 2[67]. Probably\r\nToreño is not far out when he estimates the whole at something over a\r\nthousand. Of these four-fifths must have been Spaniards, for the French\r\nonly lost heavily at the arsenal: the number of isolated soldiers\r\nmurdered in the streets at the first outbreak of the riot does not seem\r\nto have been very large.\r\n\r\n  [67] The Junta, to soothe the feelings of Madrid, gave out that\r\n  only 150 Spaniards had fallen. The _Moniteur_ said that 2,000\r\n  criminals had been cut down or executed! Murat reported a loss of\r\n  eighty men only, while Napier says that he has excellent French\r\n  authority and eye-witnesses to the effect that 750 fell.\r\n\r\nMany French authors have called the rising a deliberate and\r\npreconcerted conspiracy to massacre the French garrison. On the other\r\nhand Spanish writers have asserted that Murat had arranged everything\r\nso as to cause a riot, in order that he might have the chance of\r\nadministering a ‘whiff of grape-shot,’ after his master’s plan.\r\nBut it is clear that both are making unfounded accusations: if the\r\ninsurrection had been premeditated, the Spanish soldiery would have\r\nbeen implicated in it, for nothing would have been easier than to\r\nstir them up. Yet of the whole 3,000 only forty ran out to help the\r\ninsurgents. Moreover, the mob would have been found armed at the first\r\ncommencement of trouble, which it certainly was not. On the other hand,\r\nif Murat had been organizing a massacre, he would not have been caught\r\nwith no more than two squadrons of cavalry and five or six companies\r\nof infantry under his hand. These might have been cut to pieces before\r\nthe troops from outside could come to their help. He had been expecting\r\nriots, and was prepared to deal with them, but was surprised by a\r\nserious insurrection on a larger scale than he had foreseen, and at a\r\nmoment when he was not ready.\r\n\r\nFor a few days after May 2, Murat at Madrid and his master at Bayonne\r\nwere both living in a sort of fools’ paradise, imagining that ‘the\r\naffairs of Spain were going off wonderfully well,’ and that ‘the\r\nparty of Ferdinand had been crushed by the prompt suppression of its\r\nconspiracy.’ The Grand-Duke had the simplicity or the effrontery to\r\nissue a proclamation in which he said ‘that every good Spaniard had\r\ngroaned at the sight of such disorders,’ and another in which the\r\ninsurrection was attributed to ‘the machinations of our common enemy,\r\ni.e. the British government[68].’ On May 4 Don Antonio laid down the\r\npresidency of the Junta without a word of regret, and went off to\r\nBayonne, having first borrowed 25,000 francs from Murat. The latter, by\r\nvirtue of a decree issued by Charles IV, then assumed the presidency\r\nof the Junta of Regency. The rest of the members of that ignoble body\r\neasily sank into his servile instruments, though they had at last\r\nreceived a secret note smuggled out from Bayonne, in which Ferdinand\r\n(the day before his abdication) told them to regard his removal into\r\nthe interior of France as a declaration of war, and to call the nation\r\nto arms. To this they paid no attention, while they pretended to take\r\nthe document of resignation, which Bonaparte had forced him to sign,\r\nas an authentic and spontaneous expression of his will. The fact is\r\nthat twenty years of Godoy had thoroughly demoralized the bureaucracy\r\nand the court of Spain: if the country’s will had not found better\r\nexponents than her ministers and officials, Napoleon might have done\r\nwhat he pleased with the Peninsula.\r\n\r\n  [68] Proclamations of May 2 and 3: there are originals in the\r\n  _Vaughan Papers_.\r\n\r\nAt present his sole interest seems to have lain in settling the details\r\nof his brother Joseph’s election to the Spanish throne. Ferdinand’s\r\nfinal resignation of all his rights having been signed on May 10, the\r\nfield was open for his successor. The Emperor thought that some sort of\r\ndeputation to represent the Spanish nation ought to be got together,\r\nin order that his brother might not seem to receive the crown from his\r\nown hands only. Murat was first set to work to terrorize the Junta\r\nof Regency, and the ‘Council of Castile,’ a body which practically\r\noccupied much the same position as the English Privy Council. At his\r\ndictation the Junta yielded, but with an ill grace, and sent petitions\r\nto Bayonne asking for a new monarch, and suggesting (as desired) that\r\nthe person chosen might be Joseph Bonaparte, King of Naples [May\r\n13]. Murat had just been informed that as all had gone well with the\r\nEmperor’s plans he should have his reward: he might make his choice\r\nbetween the thrones of Naples and of Portugal. He wisely chose the\r\nformer, where the rough work of subjection had already been done by his\r\npredecessor.\r\n\r\nBut resolved to get together something like a representative body\r\nwhich might vote away the liberty of Spain, Napoleon nominated, in\r\nthe Madrid Gazette of May 24, 150 persons who were to go to Bayonne\r\nand there ask him to grant them a king. He named a most miscellaneous\r\ncrowd--ministers, bishops, judges, municipal officers of Madrid, dukes\r\nand counts, the heads of the religious orders, the Grand Inquisitor and\r\nsome of his colleagues, and six well-known Americans who were to speak\r\nfor the colonies. To the eternal disgrace of the ruling classes of\r\nSpain, no less than ninety-one of the nominees were base enough to obey\r\nthe orders given them, to go to Bayonne, and there to crave as a boon\r\nthat the weak and incompetent Joseph Bonaparte might be set to govern\r\ntheir unhappy country, under the auspices of his brother the hero and\r\nregenerator. Long before the degrading farce was complete, the whole\r\ncountry was in arms behind them, and they knew themselves for traitors.\r\nThe election of King Joseph I was only taken in hand on June 15, while\r\ntwenty days before the north and south of Spain had risen in arms in\r\nthe name of the captive Ferdinand VII.\r\n\r\nIt took a week for the news of the insurrection of May 2 to spread\r\nround Spain: in the public mouth it of course assumed the shape of\r\na massacre deliberately planned by Murat. It was not till some days\r\nlater that the full details of the events at Bayonne got abroad. But\r\never since the surprise of the frontier fortresses in February and\r\nMarch, intelligent men all over the country had been suspecting that\r\nsome gross act of treachery was likely to be the outcome of the French\r\ninvasion. Yet in most of the districts of Spain there was a gap of some\r\ndays between the arrival of the news of the King’s captivity and the\r\nfirst outbreak of popular indignation. The fact was that the people\r\nwere waiting for the lawful and constituted authorities to take action,\r\nand did not move of themselves till it was certain that no initiative\r\nwas to be expected from those in high places. But Spain was a country\r\nwhich had long been governed on despotic lines; and its official\r\nchiefs, whether the nominees of Godoy or of the knot of intriguers who\r\nhad just won their way to power under Ferdinand, were not the men to\r\nlead a war of national independence. Many were mere adventurers, who\r\nhad risen to preferment by flattering the late favourite. Others were\r\ntypical bureaucrats, whose only concern was to accept as legitimate\r\nwhatever orders reached them from Madrid: provided those orders were\r\ncouched in the proper form and written on the right paper, they did not\r\nlook to see whether the signature at the bottom was that of Godoy or\r\nof the Infante Don Antonio, or of Murat. Others again were courtiers\r\nwho owed their position to their great names, and not to any personal\r\nability. It is this fact that accounts for the fortnight or even three\r\nweeks of torpor that followed the events of the second and sixth of\r\nMay. Murat’s orders during that space travelled over the country, and\r\nmost of the captains-general and other authorities seemed inclined to\r\nobey them. Yet they were orders which should have stirred up instant\r\ndisobedience; the Mediterranean squadron was to be sent to Toulon,\r\nwhere (if it did not get taken on the way by the British) it would\r\nfall into the hands of Napoleon. A large detachment of the depleted\r\nregular army was to sail for Buenos Ayres, with the probable prospect\r\nof finding itself ere long on the hulks at Portsmouth, instead of on\r\nthe shores of the Rio de la Plata. The Swiss regiments in Spanish pay\r\nwere directed to be transferred to the French establishment, and to\r\ntake the oath to Napoleon. All this could have no object save that of\r\ndiminishing the fighting power of the country.\r\n\r\nThe first province where the people plucked up courage to act without\r\ntheir officials, and to declare war on France in spite of the dreadful\r\nodds against them, was the remote and inaccessible principality of\r\nthe Asturias, pressed in between the Bay of Biscay and the Cantabrian\r\nhills. Riots began at its capital, Oviedo, as early as the first\r\narrival of the news from Madrid on May 9, when Murat’s edicts were\r\ntorn down in spite of the feeble resistance of the commander of the\r\ngarrison and some of the magistrates. The Asturias was one of the few\r\nprovinces of Spain which still preserved vestiges of its mediaeval\r\nrepresentative institutions. It had a ‘Junta General,’ a kind of local\r\n‘estates,’ which chanced to be in session at the time of the crisis.\r\nBeing composed of local magnates and citizens, and not of officials and\r\nbureaucrats, this body was sufficiently in touch with public opinion to\r\nfeel itself borne on to action. After ten days of secret preparation,\r\nthe city of Oviedo and the surrounding country-side rose in unison\r\non May 24: the partisans of the new government were imprisoned, and\r\nnext day the estates formally declared war on Napoleon Bonaparte, and\r\nordered a levy of 18,000 men from the principality to resist invasion.\r\nA great part of the credit for this daring move must be given to the\r\npresident of the Junta, the Marquis of Santa Cruz, who had stirred\r\nup his colleagues as early as the thirteenth by declaring that ‘when\r\nand wherever one single Spaniard took arms against Napoleon, he would\r\nshoulder a musket and put himself at that man’s side.’ The Asturians\r\nhad knowledge that other provinces would follow their example; there\r\nwas only one battalion of regular troops and one of militia under arms\r\nin the province; its financial resources were small. Its only strength\r\nlay in the rough mountains that had once sheltered King Pelayo from\r\nthe Moors. It was therefore an astounding piece of patriotism when the\r\ninhabitants of the principality threw down the challenge to the victor\r\nof Jena and Austerlitz, confiding in their stern resolution and their\r\ngood cause. All through the war the Asturias played a very creditable\r\npart in the struggle, and never let the light of liberty go out, though\r\noften its capital and its port of Gihon fell into French hands.\r\n\r\nOne of the first and wisest measures taken by the Asturian Junta was an\r\nattempt to interest Great Britain in the insurrection. On May 30 they\r\nsent to London two emissaries (one of whom was the historian Toreño)\r\non a Jersey privateer, whose captain was persuaded to turn out of his\r\ncourse for the public profit. On June 7 they had reached London and had\r\nan interview with Canning, the Foreign Secretary of the Tory government\r\nwhich had lately come into power. Five days later they were assured\r\nthat the Asturias might draw on England for all it required in the way\r\nof arms, munitions, and money. All this was done before it was known in\r\nEngland that any other Spanish province was stirring, for it was not\r\ntill June 22 that the plenipotentiaries of the other juntas began to\r\nappear in London.\r\n\r\nThe revolt of other provinces followed in very quick succession.\r\nGalicia rose on May 30, in spite of its captain-general, Filanghieri,\r\nwhose resistance to the popular voice cost him his popularity and,\r\nnot long after, his life. Corunna and Ferrol, the two northern\r\narsenals of Spain, led the way. This addition to the insurgent\r\nforces was very important, for the province was full of troops--the\r\ngarrisons that protected the ports from English descents. There were\r\neighteen battalions of regulars and fourteen of militia--a whole\r\narmy--concentrated in this remote corner of Spain. Napoleon’s plan\r\nof removing the Spanish troops from the neighbourhood of Madrid had\r\nproduced the unintended result of making the outlying provinces very\r\nstrong for self-defence.\r\n\r\nIt is more fitting for a Spanish than an English historian to descend\r\ninto the details of the rising of each province of Spain. The general\r\ncharacteristics of the outburst in each region were much the same:\r\nhardly anywhere did the civil or military officials in charge of the\r\ndistrict take the lead. Almost invariably they hung back, fearing\r\nfor their places and profits, and realizing far better than did the\r\ninsurgents the enormous military power which they were challenging.\r\nThe leaders of the movement were either local magnates not actually\r\nholding office--like the celebrated Joseph Palafox at Saragossa--or\r\ndemagogues of the streets, or (but less frequently than might have\r\nbeen expected) churchmen, Napoleon was quite wrong when he called the\r\nSpanish rising ‘an insurrection of monks.’ The church followed the\r\nnation, and not the nation the church: indeed many of the spiritual\r\nhierarchy were among the most servile instruments of Murat. Among them\r\nwas the primate of Spain, the Archbishop of Toledo, who was actually\r\na scion of the house of Bourbon. There were many ecclesiastics among\r\nthe dishonoured ninety-one that went to Bayonne, if there were others\r\nwho (like the Bishop of Santander) put themselves at the head of their\r\nflocks when the country took arms.\r\n\r\nIt was a great misfortune for Spain that the juntas, which were\r\neverywhere formed when the people rose, had to be composed in large\r\npart of men unacquainted with government and organization. There were\r\nmany intelligent patriots among their members, a certain number of\r\nstatesmen who had been kept down or disgraced by Godoy, but also a\r\nlarge proportion of ambitious windbags and self-seeking intriguers. It\r\nwas hard to constitute a capable government, on the spur of the moment,\r\nin a country which had suffered twenty years of Godoy’s rule.\r\n\r\nAn unfortunate feature of the rising was that in most of the provinces,\r\nand especially those of the south, it took from the first a very\r\nsanguinary cast. It was natural that the people should sweep away in\r\ntheir anger every official who tried to keep them down, or hesitated\r\nto commit himself to the struggle with France. But there was no reason\r\nto murder these weaklings or traitors, in the style of the Jacobins.\r\nThere was a terrible amount of assassination, public and private,\r\nduring the first days of the insurrection. Three captains-general were\r\nslain under circumstances of brutal cruelty--Filanghieri in Galicia,\r\nTorre del Fresno in Estremadura, Solano at Cadiz. The fate of Solano\r\nmay serve as an example: he tried to keep the troops from joining the\r\npeople, and vainly harangued the mob: pointing to the distant sails\r\nof the English blockading squadron he shouted, ‘There are your real\r\nenemies!’ But his words had no effect: he was hunted down in a house\r\nwhere he took refuge, and was being dragged to be hung on the public\r\ngallows, when the hand of a fanatic (or perhaps of a secret friend\r\nwho wished to spare him a dishonourable death) dealt him a fatal\r\nstab in the side. Gregorio de la Cuesta, the Governor-General of Old\r\nCastile, who was destined to play such a prominent and unhappy part in\r\nthe history of the next two years, nearly shared Solano’s fate. The\r\npopulace of Valladolid, where he was residing, rose in insurrection\r\nlike those of the other cities of Spain. They called on their military\r\nchief to put himself at their head; but Cuesta, an old soldier of the\r\nmost unintelligent and brainless sort, hated mob-violence almost more\r\nthan he hated the French. He held back, not from a desire to serve\r\nBonaparte, but from a dislike to being bullied by civilians. The\r\nindignant populace erected a gallows outside his house and came to hang\r\nhim thereon. It was not, it is said, till the rope was actually round\r\nhis neck that the obstinate old man gave in. The Castilians promptly\r\nreleased him, and put him at the head of the armed rabble which formed\r\ntheir only force. Remembering the awful slaughter at Cabezon, at Medina\r\nde Rio Seco, and at Medellin, which his incapacity and mulish obstinacy\r\nwas destined to bring about, it is impossible not to express the wish\r\nthat his consent to take arms had been delayed for a few minutes longer.\r\n\r\nAll over Spain there took place, during the last days of May and\r\nthe first week of June, scores of murders of prominent men, of old\r\nfavourites of Godoy, of colonels who would not allow their regiments\r\nto march, of officials who had shown alacrity in obeying the orders of\r\nMurat. In the Asturias and at Saragossa alone do the new juntas seem\r\nto have succeeded in keeping down assassination. The worst scenes took\r\nplace at Valencia, where a mad priest, the Canon Baltasar Calvo, led\r\nout a mob of ruffians who in two days [June 6-7] murdered 338 persons,\r\nthe whole colony of French merchants residing in that wealthy town. It\r\nis satisfactory to know that when the Junta of Valencia felt itself\r\nfirmly seated in the saddle of power, it seized and executed this\r\nabominable person and his chief lieutenants. In too many parts of Spain\r\nthe murderers went unpunished: yet remembering the provocation which\r\nthe nation had received, and comparing the blood shed by mob-violence\r\nwith that which flowed in Revolutionary France, we must consider the\r\noutburst deplorable rather than surprising.\r\n\r\nWhen the insurrection had reached its full development, we find that\r\nit centred round five points, in each of which a separate junta had\r\nseized on power and begun to levy an army. The most powerful focus\r\nwas Seville, from which all Andalusia took its directions: indeed\r\nthe Junta of Seville had assumed the arrogant style of ‘supreme Junta\r\nof Spain and the Indies,’ to which it had no legitimate title. The\r\nimportance of Andalusia was that it was full of troops, the regular\r\ngarrisons having been joined by most of the expeditionary corps which\r\nhad returned from southern Portugal. Moreover it was in possession of a\r\nfull treasury and a fleet, and had free communication with the English\r\nat Gibraltar. On June 15 the Andalusians struck the first military blow\r\nthat told on Napoleon, by bombarding and capturing the French fleet\r\n(the relics of Trafalgar) which lay at their mercy within the harbour\r\nof Cadiz.\r\n\r\nThe second in importance of the centres of resistance was Galicia,\r\nwhich was also fairly well provided with troops, and contained the\r\narsenals of Ferrol and Corunna. The risings in Asturias, and the\r\nfeebler gatherings of patriots in Leon and Old Castile, practically\r\nbecame branches of the Galician insurrection, though they were directed\r\nby their own juntas and tried to work for themselves. It was on the\r\narmy of Galicia that they relied for support, and without it they would\r\nnot have been formidable. The boundaries of this area of insurrection\r\nwere Santander, Valladolid, and Segovia: further east the troops of\r\nMoncey and Bessières, in the direction of Burgos and Aranda, kept the\r\ncountry-side from rising. There were sporadic gatherings of peasants\r\nin the Upper Ebro valley and the mountains of Northern Castile, but\r\nthese were mere unorganized ill-armed bands that half a battalion could\r\ndisperse. It was the same in the Basque Provinces and Navarre: here too\r\nthe French lay cantoned so thickly that it was impossible to meddle\r\nwith them: their points of concentration were Vittoria and the two\r\nfortresses of Pampeluna and San Sebastian.\r\n\r\nThe other horn of the half-moon of revolt, which encircled Madrid, was\r\ncomposed of the insurrections in Murcia and Valencia to the south and\r\nAragon to the north. These regions were much less favourably situated\r\nfor forming centres of resistance, because they were very weak in\r\norganized troops. When the Aragonese elected Joseph Palafox as their\r\ncaptain-general and declared war on France, there were only 2,000\r\nregulars and one battery of artillery in their realm. The levies which\r\nthey began to raise were nothing more than half-armed peasants, with no\r\nadequate body of officers to train and drill them. Valencia and Murcia\r\nwere a little better off, because the arsenal of Cartagena and its\r\ngarrison lay within their boundaries, but there were only 9,000 men\r\nin all under arms in the two provinces. Clearly they could not hope to\r\ndeliver such a blow as Galicia or Andalusia might deal.\r\n\r\nThe last centre of revolt, Catalonia, did not fall into the same\r\nstrategical system as the other four. It looked for its enemies not\r\nat Madrid, but at Barcelona, where Lecchi and Duhesme were firmly\r\nestablished ever since their _coup de main_ in February. The Catalans\r\nhad as their task the cutting off of this body of invaders from its\r\ncommunication with France, and the endeavour to prevent new forces\r\nfrom joining it by crossing the Eastern Pyrenees. The residence of the\r\ninsurrectionary Junta was at Tarragona, but the most important point in\r\nthe province for the moment was Gerona, a fortress commanding the main\r\nroad from France, which Napoleon had not had the foresight to seize at\r\nthe same moment that he won by treachery Barcelona and Figueras. While\r\nthe Spaniards could hold it, they had some chance of isolating the army\r\nof Duhesme from its supports. In Catalonia, or in the Balearic Isles\r\noff its coast, there were in May 1808, about 16,000 men of regular\r\ntroops, among whom there were only 1,200 soldiers of the cavalry arm.\r\nThere was no militia, but by old custom the _levée en masse_ might\r\nalways be called out in moments of national danger. These irregulars,\r\n_somatenes_ as they were called (from _somaten_, the alarm-bell which\r\nroused them), turned out in great numbers according to ancient custom:\r\nthey had been mobilized thirteen years before in the French War of\r\n1793-5 and their warlike traditions were by no means forgotten. All\r\nthrough the Peninsular struggle they made a very creditable figure,\r\nconsidering their want of organization and the difficulty of keeping\r\nthem together.\r\n\r\nThe French armies, putting aside Duhesme’s isolated force at Barcelona,\r\nlay compactly in a great wedge piercing into the heart of Spain. Its\r\npoint was at Toledo, just south of Madrid: its base was a line drawn\r\nfrom San Sebastian to Pampeluna across the Western Pyrenees. Its\r\nbackbone lay along the great high road from Vittoria by Burgos to\r\nMadrid. The advantageous point of this position was that it completely\r\nsplit Central Spain in two: there was no communication possible\r\nbetween the insurgents of Galicia and those of Aragon. On the other\r\nhand the wedge was long and narrow, and exposed to be pierced by a\r\nforce striking at it either from the north-east or the north-west. The\r\nAragonese rebels were too few to be dangerous; but the strong Spanish\r\narmy of Galicia was well placed for a blow at Burgos, and a successful\r\nattack in that direction would cut off Madrid from France, and leave\r\nthe troops in and about the capital, who formed the point of the\r\nintrusive wedge, in a very perilous condition. This is the reason why,\r\nin the first stage of the war, Napoleon showed great anxiety as to what\r\nthe army of Galicia might do, while professing comparative equanimity\r\nabout the proceedings of the other forces of the insurrection.\r\n\r\nHaving thus sketched the strategic position of affairs in the Peninsula\r\nduring the first days of June, we must set ourselves to learn the main\r\ncharacteristics of the military geography of Spain, and to estimate the\r\ncharacter, organization, and fighting value of the two armies which\r\nwere just about to engage. Without some knowledge of the conditions\r\nof warfare in Spain, a mere catalogue of battles and marches would be\r\nabsolutely useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II\r\n\r\nTHE LAND AND THE COMBATANTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nMILITARY GEOGRAPHY OF THE PENINSULA: MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, ROADS\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the regions of Europe, the Iberian Peninsula possesses the best\r\nmarked frontier. It is separated from France, its only neighbour, by\r\none broad range of mountains, which defines its boundaries even more\r\nclearly than the Alps mark those of Italy. For the Alps are no single\r\nchain, but a system of double and triple chains running parallel to\r\neach other, and leaving between them debatable lands such as Savoy and\r\nthe Southern Tyrol. Between Spain and France there is no possibility\r\nof any such claims and counter-claims. It is true that Roussillon,\r\nwhere the eastern end of the Pyrenean range runs into the sea, was\r\nSpanish down to 1659, but that was a political survival from the Middle\r\nAges, not a natural union: there can be no doubt that geographically\r\nRoussillon is a French and not an Iberian land: the main backbone of\r\nthe boundary chain lies south and not north of it.\r\n\r\nThe Pyrenees, though in height they cannot vie with the Alps, and\r\nthough they are not nearly so jagged or scarped as the greater chain,\r\nare extremely difficult to cross, all the more so because the hand of\r\nman has seldom come to help the hand of nature in making practicable\r\nlines of access between France and Spain. In the whole length between\r\nthe Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean there are only two short fronts\r\nwhere intercommunication is easy, and these lie at the extreme east\r\nand west, where the mountains touch the sea. In the 250 miles which\r\nintervene there is hardly one good pass practicable for wheeled traffic\r\nor for the march of an army: most are mere mule-paths, rarely used\r\nsave by smugglers and shepherds. The only one of these minor routes\r\nemployed in the war was that which leads from Jaca in Aragon to Oloron\r\nin Béarn, and that was not much used: only on one single occasion\r\nin 1813 does it appear prominently in history, when Clausel’s French\r\ndivision, fleeing before Wellington and pressed up against the foot of\r\nthe mountains, escaped across it with some difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe only passes that were systematically employed during the war were\r\nthose which lie close to the water at each end of the Pyrenean chain.\r\nAt the eastern end there are three which lead from Roussillon into\r\nCatalonia. One hugs the water’s edge, and crawls along under the cliffs\r\nfrom Perpignan to Rosas: this was not in 1808 the most important of the\r\nthree, though it is the one by which the railway passes to-day. Inland\r\nthere are two other roads over difficult crests--one ten, the other\r\nforty miles from the shore--the former from Bellegarde to Figueras, the\r\nother from Mont-Louis to Puycerda and Vich. The first was the pass most\r\nused in the war, being less exposed than the Rosas route to English\r\ndescents from the sea: the coast road could actually be cannonaded by\r\nwarships at some corners. It was blocked indeed by the fortress of\r\nFigueras, but that stronghold was only in Spanish hands for a very\r\nshort period of the war. The inmost, or Mont-Louis-Puycerda road was\r\nbad, led into nothing more than a few upland valleys, and was very\r\nlittle employed by the French. It would have been of importance had it\r\nled down into the lowlands of Aragon, but after taking a long turn in\r\nthe hills it harks back towards the Catalan coast, and joins the other\r\ntwo roads near Gerona--a fortress which is so placed as practically to\r\ncommand every possible access into Eastern Spain.\r\n\r\nTaking all three of these paths into Catalonia together, they do\r\nbut form a sort of back door into the Iberian Peninsula. They only\r\ncommunicate with the narrow eastern coast-strip from Barcelona to\r\nValencia. There is no direct access from them into Castile, the heart\r\nof the country, and only a roundabout entrance by Lerida into Aragon.\r\nThe great mass of the Catalan and Valencian Sierras bars them out from\r\nthe main bulk of the Spanish realm. Catalonia and Valencia, wealthy and\r\nin parts fertile as they are, are but its back premises.\r\n\r\nThe true front door of the kingdom is formed by the passes at the\r\nother, the western, end of the Pyrenees. Here too we have three\r\navailable routes, but they differ in character from the roads at the\r\nedge of the Mediterranean, in that they open up two completely separate\r\nlines of advance into Spain, and do not (like the Catalan defiles)\r\nall lead on to the same goal. All three start from Bayonne, the great\r\nsouthern fortress of Gascony. The first keeps for some time close to\r\nthe seaside, and after crossing the Bidassoa, the boundary river of\r\nFrance and Spain, at Irun, leaves the fortress of San Sebastian a few\r\nmiles to its right and then charges the main chain of the mountains. It\r\nemerges at Vittoria, the most northerly town of importance in the basin\r\nof the Ebro. A few miles further south it crosses that stream, and then\r\nmakes for Burgos and Madrid, over two successive lines of Sierras. It\r\nopens up the heart of both Old and New Castile. The other two roads\r\nfrom Bayonne strike inland at once, and do not hug the Biscayan shore\r\nlike the Irun-Vittoria route. They climb the Pyrenees, one by the pass\r\nof Maya, the other, twenty miles further east, by the more famous pass\r\nof Roncesvalles, where Charlemagne suffered disaster of old, and left\r\nthe great paladin, Roland, dead behind him. The Maya and Roncesvalles\r\nroads join, after passing the mountains, at the great fortress of\r\nPampeluna, the capital of Navarre. From thence several lines are\r\navailable for the invader, the two chief of which are the roads into\r\nOld Castile by Logroño and into Aragon by Tudela. Pampeluna is quite as\r\nvaluable as Vittoria as the base for an attack on Central Spain.\r\n\r\nThe whole Iberian Peninsula has been compared, not inaptly, to an\r\ninverted soup-plate: roughly it consists of a high central plateau,\r\nsurrounded by a flat rim. But no comparison of that kind can be pressed\r\ntoo hard, and we must remember that the rim is variable in width:\r\nsometimes, as on the north coast, and in the extreme south-east of the\r\npeninsula, it is very narrow, and much cut up by small spurs running\r\ndown to the sea. But as a rule, and especially in Central Portugal,\r\nAndalusia, Murcia, and Valencia, it is broad and fertile. Indeed if we\r\nset aside the northern coast--Biscay, Asturias, and Galicia--we may\r\ndraw a sharp division between the rich and semi-tropical coast plain,\r\nand the high, wind-swept, and generally barren central plateau. All\r\nthe wealth of the land lies in the outer strip: the centre is its most\r\nthinly inhabited and worthless part. Madrid, lying in the very midst\r\nof the plateau, is therefore not the natural centre of the land in\r\nanything save a mathematical sense. It is a new and artificial town of\r\nthe sixteenth century, pitched upon as an administrative capital by\r\nthe Hapsburg kings; but in spite of the long residence of the court\r\nthere, it never grew into a city of the first class. Summing up its\r\nineligibilities, an acute observer said that Madrid combined ‘the soil\r\nof the Sahara, the sun of Calcutta, the wind of Edinburgh, and the\r\ncold of the North Pole.’ Though in no sense the natural capital of\r\nthe country, it has yet a certain military importance as the centre\r\nfrom which the road-system of Spain radiates. There is, as a glance at\r\nthe map will show, no other point from which all the main avenues of\r\ncommunication with the whole of the provinces can be controlled. An\r\ninvader, therefore, who has got possession of it can make any combined\r\naction against himself very difficult. But he must not flatter himself\r\nthat the capture of Madrid carries with it the same effect that the\r\ncapture of Paris or Berlin or Vienna entails. The provinces have\r\nno such feeling of dependence on the national capital as is common\r\nin other countries. France with Paris occupied by an enemy is like\r\na body deprived of its head. But for Andalusians or Catalonians or\r\nGalicians the occupation of Madrid had no such paralysing effect. No\r\nsentimental affection for the royal residence--and Madrid was nothing\r\nmore--existed. And a government established at Seville or Cadiz, or\r\nany other point, would be just as well (or as ill) obeyed as one that\r\nissued its orders from the sandy banks of the Manzanares.\r\n\r\nThe main geographical, as well as the main political, characteristics\r\nof Spain are determined by its very complicated mountain-system. It\r\nis a land where the rivers count for little, and the hills for almost\r\neverything, in settling military conditions. In most countries great\r\nrivers are connecting cords of national life: their waters carry the\r\ninternal traffic of the realm: the main roads lie along their banks.\r\nBut in Spain the streams, in spite of their length and size, are\r\nuseless. They mostly flow in deep-sunk beds, far below the level of the\r\nsurrounding country-side. Their rapid current is always swirling round\r\nrocks, or dashing over sandbanks: often they flow for mile after mile\r\nbetween cliffs from which it is impossible to reach the water’s edge.\r\nIn the rainy season they are dangerous torrents: in the summer all save\r\nthe very largest dwindle down into miserable brooks. A river in Spain\r\nis always a sundering obstacle, never a line of communication. Only for\r\na few scores of miles near their mouths can any one of them be utilized\r\nfor navigation: the Douro can be so employed as far as Freneda on the\r\nfrontier of Portugal, the Tagus in good seasons as far as Abrantes, the\r\nGuadalquivir to Seville. For the rest of their long courses they are\r\nnot available even for the lightest boats.\r\n\r\nSpanish rivers, in short, are of importance not as lines of transit,\r\nbut as obstacles. They form many fine positions for defence, but\r\npositions generally rendered dangerous by the fact that a very few\r\ndays of drought may open many unsuspected fords, where just before\r\nthere had been deep and impassable water. Rivers as broad as the Tagus\r\nbelow Talavera and the Douro at Toro were occasionally crossed by whole\r\narmies in dry weather. It was always hazardous to trust to them as\r\npermanent lines of defence.\r\n\r\nIt is the mountains which really require to be studied in detail from\r\nthe military point of view. Speaking generally we may describe the\r\nIberian system--as distinct from the Pyrenees--as consisting of one\r\nchain running roughly from north to south, so as to separate the old\r\nkingdoms of Castile and Aragon, while at right angles to this chain run\r\na number of others, whose general courses are parallel to each other\r\nand run from east to west. There is no single name for the mountains\r\nwhich separate Castile and Aragon, nor do they form one continuous\r\nrange. They are a number of separate systems, often divided from each\r\nother by wide gaps, and sometimes broadening out into high tablelands.\r\nThe central nucleus, from which the rest run out, lies between the\r\nprovinces of New Castile and Valencia, from Guadalajara in the former\r\nto Morella in the latter. Here there is a great ganglion of chaotic\r\nsierras, pierced by hardly a single practicable road. Northward, in\r\nthe direction of Aragon, they sink down into the plain of the Ebro:\r\nsouthward they spread out into the lofty plateau of Murcia, but rise\r\ninto higher and narrower ranges again as they get near the frontier of\r\nAndalusia.\r\n\r\nThis block of chains and plateaus forms the central watershed of Spain,\r\nwhich throws westward the sources of the Douro, Tagus, Guadiana, and\r\nGuadalquivir, and eastward those of the Xucar and Segura. The basins\r\nof these streams and their tributaries form three-fourths of the\r\nIberian Peninsula. The rest consists mainly of the great valley of the\r\nEbro: this hardly falls into the system, and is somewhat exceptional.\r\nIt has been described as serving as a sort of wet-ditch to the main\r\nfortification of the peninsula. Starting in the western extension of\r\nthe Pyrenees, quite close to the Bay of Biscay, it runs diagonally\r\nacross Spain, more or less parallel to the Pyrenees, and falls into the\r\nMediterranean between Catalonia and Valencia. It is more low-lying than\r\nthe rest of the main valleys of Spain, is broader, and is not so much\r\ncramped and cut up by mountains running down to it at right angles to\r\nits course.\r\n\r\nBehind the Ebro lie, chain after chain, the parallel sierras which\r\nmark off the divisions of the great central plateau of Spain. Arteche\r\ncompares them to the waves of a great petrified sea, running some\r\nhigher and some lower, but all washing up into jagged crests, with deep\r\ntroughs between them.\r\n\r\nThe first and most northerly of these waves is that which we may call\r\nthe range of Old Castile, which separates the basin of the Ebro from\r\nthat of the Douro. At one end it links itself to the Pyrenean chain in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Santander: at the other it curves round to join\r\nthe more central sierras in the direction of Soria and Calatayud. It is\r\nthe lowest of the chains which bound the central plateau of Spain, and\r\nis pierced by three practicable roads, of which the most important is\r\nthat from Vittoria to Burgos.\r\n\r\nBetween this chain on the east and the Cantabrian mountains on the\r\nnorth lies the great plain of Old Castile and Leon, the heart of the\r\nelder Spanish monarchy, in the days when Aragon was still independent\r\nand Andalusia remained in the hands of the Moor. It is a fairly\r\nproductive corn-producing land, studded with ancient cities such as\r\nBurgos, Palencia, Valladolid, Toro, Zamora, Salamanca. The _Tierra de\r\nCampos_ (land of the plains), as it was called, was the granary of\r\nNorthern Spain, the most civilized part of the kingdom, and the only\r\none where there existed a fairly complete system of roads. For want of\r\nthe isolated mountain chains which cut up most provinces of the Iberian\r\nPeninsula, it was hard to defend and easy to overrun. If the mountains\r\nthat divide it from the Ebro valley are once passed, there is no way of\r\nstopping the invader till he reaches the border of Asturias, Galicia,\r\nor New Castile. The whole plain forms the valley of the Upper Douro\r\nand its tributaries, the Adaja, Pisuerga, Esla, Tormes, and the rest.\r\nIt narrows down towards Portugal, as the mountains of Galicia on the\r\none side and Estremadura on the other throw out their spurs to north\r\nand south. Hence the Lower Douro valley, after the Portuguese frontier\r\nhas been passed, is a defile rather than a plain. Before Oporto and\r\nthe estuary are reached, there are many places where the mountains on\r\neither side come right down to the river’s edge.\r\n\r\nThe second chain is much more important, and more strongly marked:\r\nit divides Old from New Castile, the valley of the Douro from that\r\nof the Tagus. In its central and western parts it is really a double\r\nrange, with two narrow valleys between its chief ridges. These valleys\r\nare drained by the Zezere and Alagon, two tributaries of the Tagus\r\nwhich flow parallel for many scores of miles to the broad river which\r\nthey feed. If we call this great system of mountains the chain of New\r\nCastile it is only for convenience’ sake: the Spaniards and Portuguese\r\nhave no common name for them. In the east they are styled the Sierra\r\nde Ayllon; above Madrid they are known as the Guadarrama--a name\r\nsometimes extended to the whole chain. When they become double, west\r\nof Madrid, the northern chain is the Sierra de Gata, the southern the\r\nSierra de Gredos. Finally in Portugal the extension of the Sierra de\r\nGata is called the Sierra da Estrella, the southern parallel ridge\r\nthe Sierra do Moradal. The whole system forms a very broad, desolate,\r\nand lofty belt of hills between the Tagus and Douro, through which\r\nthe practicable passes are few and difficult. Those requiring notice\r\nare (1) the Somosierra Pass, through which runs the great northern\r\nroad from Burgos to Madrid: its name is well remembered owing to the\r\nextraordinary way in which Napoleon succeeded in forcing it (against\r\nall the ordinary rules of war) in the winter of 1808. (2) There is\r\na group of three passes, all within twelve miles of each other,\r\nacross the Guadarrama, through which there debouch on to Madrid the\r\nmain roads from North-western Spain--those from (_a_) Valladolid and\r\nSegovia, (_b_) from Astorga, Tordesillas, and Arevalo, (_c_) from\r\nSalamanca by Avila. After this group of passes there is a long space\r\nof impracticable hills, till we come to the chief road from north to\r\nsouth, parallel to the Portuguese frontier: it comes down the valley\r\nof the Alagon from Salamanca, by Baños and Plasencia, on to the great\r\nRoman bridge of Alcantara, the main passage over the Middle Tagus.\r\nThis is a bad road through a desolate country, but the exigencies of\r\nwar caused it to be used continually by the French and English armies,\r\nwhenever they had to transfer themselves from the valley of the Douro\r\nto that of the Tagus. Occasionally they employed a still worse route,\r\na little further west, from Ciudad Rodrigo by Perales to Alcantara.\r\nWhen we get within the Portuguese frontier, we find a road parallel to\r\nthe last, from Almeida by Guarda to Abrantes, also a difficult route,\r\nbut like it in perpetual use: usually, when the French marched from\r\nSalamanca to Alcantara, Wellington moved in a corresponding way from\r\nnear Almeida to Abrantes. This road runs along the basin of the Zezere,\r\nthough not down in the trough of the river, but high up the hillsides\r\nabove it. Spanish and Portuguese roads, as we shall see, generally\r\navoid the river banks and run along the slopes far above them.\r\n\r\nThe next great chain across the Peninsula is that which separates the\r\nbarren and sandy valley of the Upper Tagus from the still more desolate\r\nand melancholy plateau of La Mancha, the basin of the Guadiana. Of\r\nall the regions of Central Spain, this is the most thinly peopled\r\nand uninviting. In the whole valley there are only two towns of any\r\nsize, Ciudad Real, the capital of La Mancha, and Badajoz, the frontier\r\nfortress against Portugal. The mountains north of the Guadiana are\r\ncalled first the Sierra de Toledo, then the Sierra de Guadalupe, lastly\r\non the Portuguese frontier the Sierra de San Mamed. Their peculiarity,\r\nas opposed to the other cross-ranges of the Peninsula, is that at their\r\neastern end they do not unite directly with the mountains of Valencia,\r\nbut leave a broad gap of upland, through which the roads from Madrid to\r\nMurcia and Madrid to Valencia take their way. When the Sierra de Toledo\r\nonce begins roads are very few. There are practically only three--(1)\r\nToledo by San Vincente to Merida, a most break-neck route winding among\r\nsummits for forty miles; (2) Almaraz by Truxillo to Merida, the main\r\npath from Tagus to Guadiana, and the most used, though it is difficult\r\nand steep; (3) Alcantara by Albuquerque to Badajoz, a bad military road\r\nparallel to the Portuguese frontier, continuing the similar route from\r\nSalamanca to Alcantara.\r\n\r\nLeaving the barren basin of the Guadiana to proceed southward, we find\r\nacross our path a range of first-rate importance, the southern boundary\r\nof the central plateaux of Spain: dropping down from its crest we are\r\nno longer among high uplands, but in the broad low-lying semi-tropical\r\nplain of Andalusia, the richest region of Spain. The chain between the\r\nfertile valley of the Guadalquivir and the barren plateau of La Mancha\r\nis known for the greater part of its course as the Sierra Morena, but\r\nin its western section it takes the name of Sierra de Constantino. The\r\npasses across it require special notice: the most eastern and the most\r\nimportant is that of Despeña Perros, through which passes the high road\r\nfrom Madrid to Cordova, Seville, and Cadiz. At its southern exit was\r\nfought the fight of Baylen, in which the armies of Napoleon received\r\ntheir first great check by the surrender of Dupont and his 20,000 men\r\non July 23, 1808. Higher up the defile lies another historic spot, on\r\nwhich Christian and Moor fought the decisive battle for the mastery\r\nof Spain in the early years of the thirteenth century, the well-known\r\nfight of Las Navas de Tolosa. The Despeña Perros has two side-passes\r\nclose to its left and right: the former is that of San Estevan del\r\nPuerto: the latter is known as the ‘King’s Gate’ (Puerto del Rey). All\r\nthese three defiles present tremendous difficulties to an assailant\r\nfrom the north, yet all were carried in a single rush by the armies of\r\nSoult and Sebastiani in 1810. The central pass of the Sierra Morena\r\nlies ninety miles to the left, and is of much less importance, as it\r\nstarts from the most arid corner of La Mancha, and does not connect\r\nitself with any of the great roads from the north. It leads down on to\r\nCordova from Hinojosa. Again sixty miles to the west three more passes\r\ncome down on to Seville, the one by Llerena, the second by Monasterio,\r\nthe third by Fregenal: they lead to Badajoz and Merida. These are\r\neasier routes through a less rugged country: they were habitually used\r\nby Soult in 1811 and 1812, when, from his Andalusian base at Seville,\r\nhe used to go north to besiege or to relieve the all-important fortress\r\nof Badajoz.\r\n\r\nLast of all the great Spanish chains is that which lies close along the\r\nMediterranean Sea, forming the southern edge of the fertile Andalusian\r\nplain. It is the Sierra Nevada, which, though neither the longest nor\r\nthe broadest of the ranges of the south, contains the loftiest peaks in\r\nSpain, Mulhaçen and La Veleta. This chain runs from behind Gibraltar\r\nalong the shore, till it joins the mountains of Murcia, leaving only a\r\nvery narrow coast-strip between its foot and the southern sea. Three\r\nroads cut it in its western half, which, starting from Granada, Ronda,\r\nand Antequera all come down to the shore at, or in the neighbourhood\r\nof, the great port of Malaga. The parts of the coast-line that are far\r\nfrom that city are only accessible by following difficult roads that\r\nrun close to the water’s edge.\r\n\r\nWe have still to deal with two corners of the Iberian Peninsula,\r\nwhich do not fall into any of the great valleys that we have\r\ndescribed--Galicia and Northern Portugal in the north-west, and\r\nCatalonia in the north-east. The geographical conditions of the former\r\nregion depend on the Cantabrian Mountains, the western continuation of\r\nthe Pyrenees. This chain, after running for many miles as a single\r\nridge, forks in the neighbourhood of the town of Leon. One branch\r\nkeeps on in its original direction, and runs by the coast till it\r\nreaches the Atlantic at Cape Finisterre. The other turns south-west\r\nand divides Spain from Portugal as far as the sea. The angle between\r\nthese forking ranges is drained by a considerable river, the Minho.\r\nThe basins of this stream and its tributary the Sil, form the greater\r\npart of the province of Galicia. Their valleys are lofty, much cut up\r\nby cross-spurs, and generally barren. The access to them from Central\r\nSpain is by two openings. The main one is the high road from Madrid to\r\nCorunna by Astorga; it does not follow the course of either the Sil or\r\nthe Minho, but charges cross-ridge after cross-ridge of the spurs of\r\nthe Galician hills, till at last it comes down to the water, and forks\r\ninto two routes leading the one to Corunna, the other to the still more\r\nimportant arsenal of Ferrol. The other gate of Galicia is a little to\r\nthe south of Astorga, where a pass above the town of Puebla de Sanabria\r\ngives access to a steep and winding road parallel to the Portuguese\r\nfrontier, which finally gets into the valley of the Minho, and turns\r\ndown to reach the port of Vigo. It will be remembered that Sir John\r\nMoore, in his famous retreat, hesitated for some time at Astorga\r\nbetween the Vigo and Corunna roads, and finally chose the latter. His\r\njudgement was undoubtedly correct, but the best alternative was bad,\r\nfor in winter even the Madrid-Corunna road, the main artery of this\r\npart of Spain, is distressing enough to an army. It does not follow any\r\nwell-marked valley, but cuts across four separate ranges, every one of\r\nwhich in January was a nursery of torrents in its lower slopes, and\r\nan abode of snow in its upper levels. Besides the roads with which we\r\nhave already dealt there is a third important line of communication in\r\nGalicia, that by the narrow coast-plain of the Atlantic, from Corunna\r\nby Santiago to Vigo, and thence into Portugal as far as Oporto. This\r\nwould be a good road but for the innumerable river-mouths, small and\r\ngreat, which it has to cross: the road passes each stream just where\r\nit ceases to be tidal, and at each is fronted at right angles by a\r\ndefensible position, which, if held by a competent enemy, is difficult\r\nto force from the front, and still more difficult to turn by a detour\r\nup-stream. Nevertheless it was by this route that Soult successfully\r\ninvaded Northern Portugal in the spring of 1809. It must be remembered\r\nthat he was only opposed by bands of peasants not even organized into\r\nthe loosest form of militia.\r\n\r\nThe geography of Catalonia, the last Iberian region with which we have\r\nto deal, is more simple than that of Galicia. The land is formed by a\r\nbroad mountain belt running out from the eastern end of the Pyrenees,\r\nparallel to the Mediterranean. From this chain the slopes run down\r\nand form on the eastern side a coast-plain, generally rather narrow,\r\non the western a series of parallel valleys drained by tributaries of\r\nthe Segre, the most important affluent of the Ebro. They all unite\r\nnear Lerida, an important town and a great centre of roads. But two\r\nconsiderable rivers, the Ter and the Llobregat, have small basins\r\nof their own in the heart of the central mountain mass, which open\r\ndown into the coast-plain by defiles, the one blocked by the peak\r\nof Montserrat, the other by the town of Gerona. During the greater\r\npart of the Peninsular War the French held the larger share of the\r\nshoreland, dominating it from the great fortress of Barcelona, which\r\nthey had seized by treachery ere hostilities began. In 1811 they\r\ncaptured Tarragona also, the second capital of the sea coast. But they\r\nnever succeeded in holding down all the small upland plains, and the\r\nminor passes that lead from one to the other. Hunted out of one the\r\nSpanish army took refuge in the next, and, though it dwindled down\r\nultimately to a mass of guerilla bands, was never caught _en masse_\r\nand exterminated. There were too many bolt-holes among the network\r\nof hills, and the invaders never succeeded in stopping them all, so\r\nthat down to the end of the war the patriots always maintained a\r\nprecarious existence inland, descending occasionally to the shore to\r\nget ammunition and stores from the English squadrons which haunted the\r\ncoast. They were supplied and reinforced from the Balearic Isles, which\r\nNapoleon could never hope to touch, for his power (like that of the\r\nwitches of old) vanished when it came to running water. The survival\r\nof the Catalan resistance after the French had drawn a complete cordon\r\naround the hill-country, holding the whole coast-plain on the one hand,\r\nand Lerida and the Segre valley on the other, is one of the incidents\r\nof the war most creditable to Spanish constancy.\r\n\r\nHaving dealt with the physical geography of Spain, it is necessary\r\nfor us to point out the way in which the natural difficulties of the\r\ncountry had influenced its main lines of communication. Roads always\r\ntake the ‘line of least resistance’ in early days, and seek for easy\r\npasses, not for short cuts. The idea that ‘time is money,’ and that\r\ninstead of going round two sides of a triangle it may be worth\r\nwhile to cut a new path across its base, in spite of all engineering\r\ndifficulties, was one very unfamiliar to the Spaniard. Nothing shows\r\nmore clearly the state of mediaeval isolation in which the kingdom\r\nstill lay in 1808 than the condition of its roads. Wherever the country\r\npresented any serious obstacles, little or no attempt had been made to\r\ngrapple with them since the days of the Romans. The energetic Charles\r\nIII, alone among the kings of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,\r\nhad done something to improve the system of intercommunication. He\r\nhad, for example, superseded the old break-neck road from the plains\r\nof Leon into Galicia, by building the fine new _chaussée_ from Astorga\r\nto Villafranca by Manzanal; but among the line of Hapsburg and Bourbon\r\nsovereigns Charles was a rare exception. Under the imbecile rule\r\nof his son (or rather of Godoy) improvements ceased, and internal\r\ncommunications were as much neglected as any other branch of state\r\nmanagement. What roads there were, when the war of 1808 broke out, were\r\nin a state of dreadful neglect. The Spaniard was still too prone to\r\ngo round an intolerable distance rather than attempt a serious piece\r\nof engineering work. Let us take, for example, the northern coast of\r\nSpain: the Cantabrian range is no doubt a most serious obstacle to\r\nintercourse between Castile and Leon, on the one side, and the maritime\r\nprovinces of Asturias and Biscay on the other. But who would have\r\nconceived it possible that in a length of 300 miles of mountain, there\r\nshould be no more than five roads practicable for wheeled traffic and\r\nartillery? Yet this was so: to get down from the central plateau to\r\nthe coast there are only available these five routes--one from Leon\r\nto Oviedo, one from Burgos to Santander, one from Burgos to Bilbao,\r\none from Vittoria to Bilbao, and one from Vittoria to San Sebastian\r\nand Irun. There were many other points at which a division travelling\r\nin light order without guns or baggage could cross the watershed--as\r\nwas shown in Blake’s flight from Reynosa and Ney’s invasion of the\r\nAsturias. But for an army travelling with all its _impedimenta_ such\r\nbypaths were impracticable.\r\n\r\nLet us take another part of the Peninsula--its eastern side. The\r\nancient separation between Aragon and Castile is fully reflected by\r\nthe utter isolation of the two for intercommunication. To get from\r\nMadrid to the east coast there are only three roads suitable for\r\nwheeled traffic: one goes by the main gap in the hills by Chinchilla to\r\nMurcia, another by Requeña to Valencia. The third passes by Calatayud\r\nto Saragossa and ultimately to Barcelona. Between it and the Valencia\r\nroad there is a gap of no less than 120 miles unpierced by any good\r\npracticable line of communication[69]. This being so, we begin to\r\nunderstand how it was that the operations on the eastern side of Spain,\r\nduring the whole of the struggle, were a sort of independent episode\r\nthat never exercised any great influence on the main theatre of the\r\nwar, or, on the other hand, was much affected by the progress of the\r\nstrife in Castile or Portugal. Soult’s conquest of Andalusia did not\r\nhelp Suchet to conquer Valencia. On the other hand, when the latter\r\ndid, in January, 1812, succeed in his attempt to subdue the eastern\r\ncoast-line, it did not much affect him that Wellington was storming\r\nCiudad Rodrigo and pressing back the French in the west. He was able\r\nto hold on to Valencia till the allies, in 1813, got possession of the\r\nupper valley of the Ebro and the great road from Madrid to Saragossa\r\nand Lerida, after the battle of Vittoria. It was only then that his\r\nflank was really turned, and that he was compelled to retreat and to\r\nabandon his southern conquests.\r\n\r\n  [69] The bad cross-roads Cuenca-Teruel and Molina-Teruel hardly\r\n  count.\r\n\r\nSumming up the general characteristics of the road-system of Spain, we\r\nnote first that the main routes are rather at right angles to the great\r\nrivers than parallel to them. The sole exception is to be found in the\r\nvalley of the Ebro, where the only good cross-road of Northern Spain\r\ndoes follow the river-bank from Logroño and Tudela on to Saragossa and\r\nLerida.\r\n\r\nJust because the roads do not cling to the valleys, but strike across\r\nthem at right angles, they are always crossing watersheds by means of\r\ndifficult passes. And so there is hardly a route in the whole Peninsula\r\nwhere it is possible to find fifty miles without a good defensive\r\nposition drawn across the path. Moreover, the continual passes make\r\nthe question of supplies very difficult: in crossing a plain an army\r\ncan live, more or less, on the supplies of the country-side; but among\r\nmountains and defiles there is no population, and therefore no food\r\nto be had. Hence an army on the move must take with it all that it\r\nconsumes, by means of a heavy wagon train, or an enormous convoy of\r\npack-mules. But only the best roads are suitable for wheeled traffic,\r\nand so the lines practicable for a large host are very restricted in\r\nnumber. The student is often tempted to consider the movements of the\r\nrival generals very slow. The explanation is simply that to transfer\r\nan army from one river-basin to another was a serious matter. It was\r\nnecessary to spend weeks in collecting at the base food and transport\r\nsufficient to support the whole force till it reached its goal. In 1811\r\nor 1812 the French and English were continually moving up and down the\r\nPortuguese frontier parallel to each other, the one from Salamanca to\r\nBadajoz, the other from Almeida or Guarda to Elvas. But to prepare for\r\none of these flittings was such a serious matter that by the time that\r\nthe army was able to move, the enemy had usually got wind of the plan,\r\nand was able to follow the movement on his own side of the frontier.\r\nThere were months of preparation required before a few weeks of active\r\noperations, and when the concentration was over and the forces massed,\r\nthey could only keep together as long as the food held out, and then\r\nhad to disperse again in order to live. This was what was meant by the\r\nold epigram, that ‘in Spain large armies starve, and small armies get\r\nbeaten.’\r\n\r\nHalf the strategy of the campaigns of 1811-12-13 consisted in one of\r\nthe combatants secretly collecting stores, concentrating his whole\r\narmy, and then dashing at some important part of his adversary’s\r\nline, before the other could mass his forces in a corresponding way.\r\nIf prompt, the assailant might gain a fortnight, in which he might\r\neither try to demolish the enemy in detail before he could concentrate,\r\nor else to take from him some important position or town. In 1811\r\nMarmont and Dorsenne played this trick on Wellington, during the short\r\ncampaign of El Bodon and Aldea da Ponte. They relieved Ciudad Rodrigo,\r\nand nearly caught some divisions of the English army before the rest\r\ncould join. But missing the instant blow, and allowing Wellington time\r\nto draw in his outlying troops, they failed and went home. In 1812,\r\non the other hand, the British general successfully played off this\r\ndevice on the French. He first concentrated in the north, and captured\r\nCiudad Rodrigo in eleven days, before Marmont could mass his scattered\r\ndivisions; then going hastily south he took Badajoz in exactly the same\r\nway, storming it after only nineteen days of siege. Soult drew his army\r\ntogether at the news of Wellington’s move, but had to bring troops from\r\nsuch distances, and to collect so much food, that he arrived within\r\nthree marches of Badajoz only to hear that the place had just fallen.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the main geographical facts of the war it is fair to\r\nrecollect that an invasion of Spain from France is one of the most\r\ndifficult of undertakings, because the whole river and mountain system\r\nof the Peninsula lies _across_ the main line of advance from Bayonne\r\nto Cadiz, which the invader must adopt. While the French conquest\r\nmust be pushed from north to south, both the streams and the Sierras\r\nof Spain all run at right angles to this direction, i.e. from east to\r\nwest. In advancing from the Pyrenees to Madrid, and again from Madrid\r\nto Seville and Cadiz, the invader has to cross every main river--Ebro,\r\nDouro, Tagus, Guadiana, and Guadalquivir--and to force the passes of\r\nevery main range. Moreover, as he advances southward, he has to keep\r\nhis flanks safe against disturbance from the two mountainous regions,\r\nCatalonia and Portugal, which lie along the eastern and western coasts\r\nof the Peninsula. Unless the whole breadth of Spain, from the Atlantic\r\nto the Mediterranean, be occupied step by step as the invader moves on\r\ntowards the Straits of Gibraltar, he can always be molested and have\r\nhis lines of communication with France threatened. In the end it may\r\nbe said that Napoleon’s whole scheme of conquest was shipwrecked upon\r\nthe blunder of attacking Andalusia and Cadiz while Portugal was still\r\nunsubdued. Wellington’s constant sallies out of that country upon the\r\nFrench flank, in Leon and Estremadura, detained such large forces to\r\nprotect the valleys of the Central Douro and Tagus that enough men were\r\nnever found to finish the conquest of the south and east. And finally\r\none crushing victory at Salamanca, in the plains of Leon, so threatened\r\nthe invader’s line of touch with France, that he had to abandon the\r\nwhole south of Spain in order to concentrate an army large enough to\r\nforce Wellington back from Burgos and the great northern road.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, one tremendous advantage possessed by the French\r\nin the central years of the war must be remembered. It is manifest\r\nthat Madrid is the only really important road-centre in Spain, and\r\nthat its undisturbed possession by the French in 1809-11 gave them\r\nthe advantage of being able to operate from a single point, against\r\nenemies who lay in a vast semicircle around, with no good cross-roads\r\nto join them and enable them to work together. The small ‘Army of the\r\nCentre,’ which was always kept in and around Madrid, could be used as a\r\nreserve for any other of the French armies, and transferred to join it\r\nin a few marches, while it was infinitely more difficult to unite the\r\nvarious forces lying on an outer circle at Astorga, Almeida, Abrantes,\r\nand Cadiz, which the Spaniards and the British kept in the field. In\r\nshort, in estimating the difficulties of the two parties, the advantage\r\nof the central position must be weighed against the disadvantage of\r\nlong and exposed lines of communication.\r\n\r\nOne of the cardinal blunders of Napoleon’s whole scheme for the\r\nconquest of the Peninsula was that he persisted in treating it as if\r\nit were German or Italian soil, capable of supporting an army on the\r\nmarch. His troops were accustomed to live on the country-side while\r\ncrossing Central Europe, and therefore made no proper preparations\r\nfor supplying themselves by other means than plunder. But in Spain\r\nthere are only a few districts where this can be done: it may be\r\npossible to get forward without an enormous train of convoys in\r\nAndalusia, the coast plain of Valencia, and certain parts of the rather\r\nfertile plateau of Leon, the wheat-bearing _Tierra de Campos_. But\r\nover four-fifths of the Peninsula, an army that tries to feed on the\r\ncountry-side will find itself at the point of starvation in a few days,\r\nand be forced to disperse in order to live.\r\n\r\nTill he had seen Spain with his own eyes Napoleon might perhaps\r\nhave been excused for ignoring the fact that his ordinary method of\r\n‘making war support itself’ was not in this case possible. But even\r\nafter he had marched from Bayonne to Madrid, and then from Madrid to\r\nAstorga, in 1808, he persisted in refusing to see facts as they were.\r\nWe find him on his way back to Paris from the campaign uttering the\r\nextraordinary statement that ‘Spain is a much better country than he\r\nhad ever supposed, and that he had no idea what a magnificent present\r\nhe had made to his brother Joseph till he had seen it[70].’ Of his\r\nutter failure to grasp the difficulties of the country we may get a\r\nfair conception from his orders, given at the same time, to Marshal\r\nSoult, who was at that moment occupied in pushing Sir John Moore\r\ntowards Corunna. He told the Duke of Dalmatia that if he reached Lugo\r\non January 9, and the English got away safely by sea, he was to march\r\non Oporto, where he ought to arrive on the first of February; after\r\nseizing that city he was to go on to Lisbon, which he might reach on or\r\nabout February 10. As a matter of fact Soult saw the English depart,\r\nand occupied Corunna on January 19, but his army was so utterly worn\r\nout, and his stores so entirely exhausted, that with the best will in\r\nthe world he could not move again till February 20, only took Oporto on\r\nMarch 29, and had not yet started for Lisbon when Wellesley suddenly\r\nfell on him and drove him out of the country on May 12, 1809. The\r\nEmperor, in short, had given Soult orders executable perhaps, according\r\nto the distance, in Lombardy or Bavaria, but utterly absurd when\r\napplied to a country where roads are few and bad, with a defile or a\r\nriver crossing the path at every few miles, and where food has to be\r\ncarefully collected before a move, and taken on with the army by means\r\nof enormous convoys. Moreover the month was January, when every brook\r\nhad become a raging mountain stream, and every highland was covered\r\nwith snow! With such conceptions of the task before him, it is not\r\nwonderful that Napoleon was continually issuing wholly impracticable\r\norders. The one that we have just quoted was sent out from Valladolid:\r\nhow much worse would the case be when the Emperor persisted in\r\ndirecting affairs from Paris or Vienna, the last news that had reached\r\nhim from the front being now several weeks old! With all his genius he\r\nnever thoroughly succeeded in grasping the state of affairs, and to the\r\nvery last continued to send directions that would have been wise enough\r\nin Central Europe, but happened to be inapplicable in the Iberian\r\nPeninsula.\r\n\r\n  [70] He said this to De Pradt (_Révolutions d’Espagne_, p. 224).\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to Napoleon to add that his Spanish enemies, who ought\r\nat least to have known the limitations of their own road-system, and\r\nthe disabilities of their half-starved armies, used habitually to\r\nproduce plans of operations far more fantastically impossible than\r\nany that he ever drafted. They would arrange far-reaching schemes,\r\nfor the co-operation of forces based on the most remote corners of\r\nthe Peninsula, without attempting to work out the ‘logistics’ of the\r\nmovement. The invariable result was that such enterprises either ended\r\nin disaster, or at the best came to a stop after the first few marches,\r\nbecause some vital point of the calculation had already been proved to\r\nhave been made on erroneous data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH ARMY IN 1808\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the English student begins to investigate the Peninsular War\r\nin detail, he finds that, as regards the Spanish armies and their\r\nbehaviour, he starts with a strong hostile prejudice. The Duke of\r\nWellington in his dispatches, and still more in his private letters\r\nand his table-talk, was always enlarging on the folly and arrogance\r\nof the Spanish generals with whom he had to co-operate, and on the\r\nuntrustworthiness of their troops. Napier, the one military classic\r\nwhom most Englishmen have read, is still more emphatic and far more\r\nimpressive, since he writes in a very judicial style, and with the most\r\nelaborate apparatus of references and authorities. When the reader\r\nbegins to work through the infinite number of Peninsular diaries of\r\nBritish officers and men (for there are a very considerable number of\r\nwriters from among the rank and file) the impression left upon him is\r\nmuch the same. It must be confessed that for the most part they had a\r\nvery poor opinion of our allies.\r\n\r\nBefore allowing ourselves to be carried away by the almost unanimous\r\nverdict of our own countrymen, it is only fair to examine the state and\r\ncharacter of the Spanish army when the war broke out. Only when we know\r\nits difficulties can we judge with fairness of its conduct, or decide\r\nupon its merits and shortcomings.\r\n\r\nThe armed force which served under the banners of Charles IV in the\r\nspring of 1808 consisted of 131,000 men, of whom 101,000 were regulars\r\nand 30,000 embodied militia. The latter had been under arms since 1804,\r\nand composed the greater part of the garrisons of the seaports of\r\nSpain, all of which had to be protected against possible descents of\r\nEnglish expeditions[71].\r\n\r\n  [71] See Appendix, containing the state of the Spanish army in\r\n  1808.\r\n\r\nOf the 101,000 men of the regular army, however, not all were available\r\nfor the defence of the country. While the war with Russia was still in\r\nprogress, Bonaparte had requested the Spanish government to furnish\r\nhim with a strong division for use in the North [March, 1807], and in\r\nconsequence the Marquis of La Romana had been sent to the Baltic with\r\n15,000 men, the picked regiments of the army. There remained therefore\r\nonly 86,000 regulars within the kingdom. A very cursory glance down\r\nthe Spanish army-list of 1808 is sufficient to show that this force\r\nwas far from being in a satisfactory condition for either offensive or\r\ndefensive operations.\r\n\r\nIt is well worth while to look at the details of its composition. The\r\ninfantry consisted of three sorts of troops--the Royal Guard, the line\r\nregiments, and the foreign corps in Spanish pay. For Spain, more than\r\nany other European state, had kept up the old seventeenth-century\r\nfashion of hiring foreign mercenaries on a large scale. Even in the\r\nRoyal Guard half the infantry were composed of ‘Walloon Guards,’ a\r\nsurvival from the day when the Netherlands had been part of the broad\r\ndominions of the Hapsburg kings. The men of these three battalions\r\nwere no longer mainly Walloons, for Belgium had been a group of\r\nFrench departments for the last thirteen years. There were Germans\r\nand other foreigners of all sorts in the ranks, as well as a large\r\nnumber of native Spaniards. There were also six regiments of Swiss\r\nmercenaries--over 10,000 bayonets--and in these the men in the ranks\r\ndid really come from Switzerland and Germany, though there was a\r\nsprinkling among them of strangers from all lands who had ‘left their\r\ncountry for their country’s good.’ There were also one Neapolitan and\r\nthree Irish regiments. These latter were survivals from the days of\r\nthe ‘Penal Laws,’ when young Irishmen left their homes by thousands\r\nevery year to take service with France or Spain, in the hope of getting\r\nsome day a shot at the hated redcoats. The regiments bore the names\r\nof Hibernia, Irlanda, and Ultonia (i.e. Ulster). They were very much\r\nunder their proper establishment, for of late years Irish recruits\r\nhad begun to run short, even after the ’98: they now took service in\r\nFrance and not in Spain. The three Irish corps in 1808 had only 1,900\r\nmen under arms, instead of the 5,000 which they should have produced;\r\nand of those the large majority were not real Irish, but waifs of all\r\nnationalities. Of late native Spaniards had been drafted in, to keep\r\nthe regiments from dying out. On the other hand we shall find that not\r\nonly the foreign regiments but the whole Spanish army was still full\r\nof officers of Irish name and blood, the sons and grandsons of the\r\noriginal emigrants of two generations back. An astounding proportion\r\nof the officers who rose to some note during the war bore Irish names,\r\nand were hereditary soldiers of fortune, who justified their existence\r\nby the unwavering courage which they always showed, in a time when\r\nobstinate perseverance was the main military virtue. We need only\r\nmention Blake, the two O’Donnells, Lacy, Sarsfield, O’Neill, O’Daly,\r\nMahony, O’Donahue. If none of them showed much strategical skill, yet\r\ntheir constant readiness to fight, which no series of defeats could\r\ntame, contrasts very well with the spiritless behaviour of a good many\r\nof the Spanish generals. No officer of Irish blood was ever found among\r\nthe cowards, and hardly one among the traitors[72].\r\n\r\n  [72] The minister O’Farrill and General Kindelan were the chief\r\n  exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe ten foreign corps furnished altogether about 13,000 men to the\r\nSpanish regular army. The rest of the infantry was composed of\r\nthirty-five regiments of troops of the line, of three battalions\r\neach, and twelve single-battalion regiments of light infantry. They\r\nwere theoretically territorial, like our own infantry of to-day, and\r\nmostly bore local names derived from the provinces--Asturias, Toledo,\r\nEstremadura, and so forth. All the light infantry corps belonged to\r\nthe old kingdoms of Aragon and Navarre, which were therefore scantily\r\nrepresented in the nomenclature of the ordinary line regiments.\r\nThere were altogether 147 battalions of Spanish infantry, excluding\r\nthe foreign troops, and if all of these had been up to the proper\r\nestablishment of 840 men, the total would have amounted to 98,000\r\nbayonets. But the state of disorganization was such that as a matter of\r\nfact there were only 58,000 under arms. The regiments which Napoleon\r\nhad requisitioned for service in the North had been more or less\r\nbrought up to a war-footing, and each showed on an average 2,000 men\r\nin the ranks. But many of the corps in the interior of Spain displayed\r\nthe most lamentable figures: e.g. the three battalions of the regiment\r\nof Estremadura had only 770 men between them, Cordova 793, and Navarre\r\n822--showing 250 men to the battalion instead of the proper 840.\r\nTheoretically there should have been no difficulty in keeping them\r\nup to their proper strength, as machinery for recruiting them had\r\nbeen duly provided. Voluntary enlistment was the first resource: but\r\nwhen that did not suffice to keep the ranks full, there was a kind\r\nof limited conscription called the _Quinta_[73] to fall back upon.\r\nThis consisted in balloting for men in the regimental district, under\r\ncertain rules which allowed an enormous number of exemptions--e.g. all\r\nskilled artisans and all middle-class townsfolk were free from the\r\nburden--so that the agricultural labourers had to supply practically\r\nthe whole contingent. Substitutes were allowed, if by any means the\r\nconscript could afford to pay for them. The conscription therefore\r\nshould have kept the regiments up to their proper strength, and if\r\nmany of them had only a third of their complement under arms, it was\r\nmerely due to the general demoralization of the times. Under Godoy’s\r\nadministration money was always wanting, more especially since Napoleon\r\nhad begun to levy his monthly tribute of 6,000,000 francs from the\r\nSpanish monarchy, and the gaps in the ranks probably represented\r\nenforced economy as well as corrupt administration.\r\n\r\n  [73] So called because it was originally supposed to take the\r\n  _fifth_ man.\r\n\r\nThe 30,000 embodied militia, which formed the remainder of the Spanish\r\ninfantry, had been under arms since 1804, doing garrison duty; they\r\nseem in many respects to have been equal to the line battalions in\r\nefficiency. They bore names derived from the towns in whose districts\r\nthey had been raised--Badajoz, Lugo, Alcazar, and so forth. Their\r\nofficering was also strictly local, all ranks being drawn from the\r\nleading families of their districts, and seems to have been quite\r\nas efficient as that of the line. Moreover their ranks were, on the\r\naverage, much fuller than those of the regular regiments--only two\r\nbattalions in the total of forty-three showed less than 550 bayonets on\r\nparade.\r\n\r\nIt is when we turn to the cavalry that we come to the weakest part of\r\nthe Spanish army. There were twelve regiments of heavy and twelve of\r\nlight horse, each with a nominal establishment of 700 sabres, which\r\nshould have given 16,800 men for the whole force. There were only about\r\n15,000 officers and troopers embodied, but this was a small defect. A\r\nmore real weakness lay in the fact that there were only 9,000 horses\r\nfor the 15,000 men. It is difficult for even a wealthy government,\r\nlike our own, to keep its cavalry properly horsed, and that of Charles\r\nIV was naturally unable to cope with this tiresome military problem.\r\nThe chargers were not only too few, but generally of bad quality,\r\nespecially those of the heavy cavalry: of those which were to be\r\nfound in the regimental stables a very large proportion were not fit\r\nfor service. When the five regiments which Napoleon demanded for the\r\nexpedition to Denmark had been provided with 540 horses each and sent\r\noff, the mounts of the rest of the army were in such a deplorable\r\nstate that some corps had not the power to horse one-third of their\r\ntroopers: e.g. in June, 1808, the Queen’s Regiment, No. 2 of the\r\nheavy cavalry, had 202 horses for 668 men; the 12th Regiment had 259\r\nhorses for 667 men; the 1st Chasseurs--more extraordinary still--only\r\n185 horses for 577 men. It resulted from this penury of horses that\r\nwhen Napoleon made a second demand for Spanish cavalry, asking for a\r\ndivision of 2,000 sabres to aid Junot in invading Portugal, that force\r\nhad to be made up by putting together the mounted men of no less than\r\nten regiments, each contributing two or at the most three squadrons and\r\nleaving the rest of its men dismounted at the dépôt.\r\n\r\nEven if the cavalry had all been properly mounted, they would have been\r\nfar too few in proportion to the other arms, only 15,000 out of a total\r\nforce of 130,000--one in eight; whereas in the time of the Napoleonic\r\nwars one in six, or even one in five, was considered the proper\r\ncomplement. In the Waterloo campaign the French had the enormous number\r\nof 21,000 cavalry to 83,000 infantry--one to four. What with original\r\npaucity, and with want of remounts, the Spaniards took the field in\r\n1808, when the insurrection began, with a ridiculously small number of\r\nhorsemen. At Medina de Rio Seco they had only 750 horsemen to 22,000\r\nfoot-soldiers, at Baylen only 1,200 to 16,000. Later in the war they\r\nsucceeded in filling up the ranks of the old cavalry regiments, and\r\nin raising many new ones. But the gain in number was not in the least\r\naccompanied by a gain in efficiency. For the whole six years of the\r\nstruggle the mounted arm was the weakest point of their hosts. Again\r\nand again it disgraced itself by allowing itself to be beaten by half\r\nits own numbers, or by absconding early in the fight and abandoning\r\nits infantry. It acquired, and merited, a detestable reputation, and\r\nit is hard to find half a dozen engagements in which it behaved even\r\nreasonably well[74]. When Wellington was made generalissimo of the\r\nSpanish armies in 1813 he would not bring it up to the front at all,\r\nand though he took 40,000 Spaniards over the Pyrenees, there was\r\nnot a horseman among them. It is hard to account for the thorough\r\nworthlessness of these squadrons, even when we make allowance for all\r\nthe difficulties of the time: Spain was notoriously deficient in decent\r\ncavalry officers when the war began. The horses were inferior to the\r\nFrench, and the equipment bad. From early disasters the troopers\r\ncontracted a demoralization which they could never shake off. But\r\ngranting all this, it is still impossible to explain the consistent\r\nmisbehaviour of these evasive squadrons. The officers, no doubt, had a\r\nharder task in organizing their new levies than those of the infantry\r\nand artillery, but it is curious that they should never have succeeded\r\nin learning their business even after four or five years of war.\r\n\r\n  [74] The successful and opportune charge of the _regimiento del\r\n  Rey_ at Talavera was about the only case which ever came under\r\n  English eyes.\r\n\r\nThe artillery of the Spanish army, on the other hand, earned on the\r\nwhole a good reputation. This was not the result of proper preparation.\r\nWhen the struggle began it consisted of thirty-four batteries of field\r\nartillery, six of horse, and twenty-one garrison batteries (_compañias\r\nfijas_), with a total of 6,500 men. Forty batteries--that is to say\r\n240 guns or somewhat less, for in some cases there seem to have been\r\nonly four instead of six pieces in the battery--was according to the\r\nstandard of 1808 a mediocre allowance to an army of 130,000 men, only\r\nabout two-thirds of what it should have been[75]. But this was not the\r\nworst. Deducting four fully-horsed batteries, which had been taken\r\noff by Napoleon to Denmark, there remained in Spain four horse and\r\nthirty-two field batteries. These were practically unable to move, for\r\nthey were almost entirely destitute of horses. For the 216 guns and\r\ntheir caissons there were only in hand 400 draught animals! When the\r\nwar began, the artillery had to requisition, and more or less train,\r\n3,000 horses or mules before they could move from their barracks! I\r\ndo not know any fact that illustrates better the state of Spanish\r\nadministration under the rule of Godoy. The raising of the great\r\ninsurrectionary armies in the summer of 1808 ought to have led to an\r\nenormous increase to the artillery arm, but the trained men were so few\r\nthat the greatest difficulty was found in organizing new batteries.\r\nSomething was done by turning the marine artillery of the fleet into\r\nland troops, and there were a few hundreds of the militia who had been\r\ntrained to work guns. But the officers necessary for the training and\r\nofficering of new batteries were so scarce, that for many months no\r\nfresh forces of the artillery arm could take the field. In the autumn\r\nof 1808, at the time of the battles of Espinosa and Tudela, if we\r\ncarefully add up the number of guns brought into action by the five\r\narmies of Galicia, Estremadura, Aragon, the ‘Centre’ (i.e. Andalusia\r\nand Castile), and Catalonia, we do not find a piece more than the 240\r\nwhich existed at the outbreak of the war. That is to say, the Spaniards\r\nhad raised 100,000 new levies of infantry, without any corresponding\r\nextension of the artillery arm. During the campaign the conduct of the\r\ncorps seems on the whole to have been very good, compared with that of\r\nthe other arms. This was to be expected, as they were old soldiers to a\r\nmuch greater extent than either the infantry or the cavalry. They seem\r\nto have attained a fair skill with their weapons, and to have stuck\r\nto them very well. We often hear of gunners cut down or bayonetted\r\nover their pieces, seldom of a general bolt to the rear. For this very\r\nreason the personnel of the batteries suffered terribly: every defeat\r\nmeant the capture of some dozens of guns, and the cutting up of the men\r\nwho served them. It was as much as the government could do to keep up\r\na moderate number of batteries, by supplying new guns and amalgamating\r\nthe remnants of those which had been at the front. Each batch of lost\r\nbattles in 1808-10 entailed the loss and consequent reconstruction of\r\nthe artillery. If, in spite of this, we seldom hear complaints as to\r\nits conduct, it must be taken as a high compliment to the arm. But\r\nas long as Spanish generals persisted in fighting pitched battles,\r\nand getting their armies dispersed, a solid proportion of artillery\r\nto infantry could never be established. Its average strength may be\r\nguessed from the fact that at Albuera the best army that Spain then\r\npossessed put in line 16,300 men with only fourteen guns, less than\r\none gun per thousand men--while Napoleon (as we have already noted)\r\nbelieved that five per thousand was the ideal, and often managed in\r\nactual fact to have three. In the latter years of the war the pieces\r\nwere almost always drawn by mules, yoked tandem-fashion, and not ridden\r\nby drivers but goaded by men walking at their side--the slowest and\r\nmost unsatisfactory form of traction that can be imagined. Hence came,\r\nin great part, their inability to manœuvre.\r\n\r\n  [75] Napoleon had an ideal proportion of five guns per 1,000 men.\r\n  But, as we shall show in the next chapter, while dealing with the\r\n  French armies, he never succeeded in reaching anything like this\r\n  standard in the Peninsula. Yet his opponents were always worse\r\n  off.\r\n\r\nOf engineers Spain in 1808 had 169 officers dispersed over the kingdom.\r\nThe corps had no proper rank and file. But there was a regiment of\r\nsappers, 1,000 strong, which was officered from the engineers. There\r\nwas no army service corps, no military train, no organized commissariat\r\nof any kind. When moving about a Spanish army depended either on\r\ncontractors who undertook to provide horses and wagons driven by\r\ncivilians, or more frequently on the casual sweeping in by requisition\r\nof all the mules, oxen, and carts of the unhappy district in which it\r\nwas operating. In this respect, as in so many others, Spain was still\r\nin the Middle Ages. The fact that there was no permanent arrangement\r\nfor providing for the food of the army is enough in itself to account\r\nfor many of its disasters. If, like the British, the Spaniards had\r\npossessed money to pay for what they took, things might have worked\r\nsomewhat better. Or if, like the French, they had possessed an\r\norganized military train, and no scruples, they might have contrived\r\nto get along at the cost of utterly ruining the country-side. But\r\nas things stood, depending on incapable civil commissaries and the\r\nunwilling contributions of the local authorities, they were generally\r\non the edge of starvation. Sometimes they got over the edge, and then\r\nthe army, in spite of the proverbial frugality of the Spanish soldier,\r\nsimply dispersed. It is fair to the men to say that they generally\r\nstraggled back to the front sooner or later, when they had succeeded in\r\nfilling their stomachs, and got incorporated in their own or some other\r\nregiment. It is said that by the end of the war there were soldiers who\r\nhad, in their fashion, served in as many as ten different corps during\r\nthe six years of the struggle.\r\n\r\nSumming up the faults of the Spanish army, its depleted battalions,\r\nits small and incompetent cavalry force, its insufficient proportion\r\nof artillery, its utter want of commissariat, we find that its main\r\nsource of weakness was that while the wars of the French Revolution\r\nhad induced all the other states of Europe to overhaul their military\r\norganization and learn something from the methods of the French,\r\nSpain was still, so far as its army was concerned, in the middle of\r\nthe eighteenth century. The national temperament, with its eternal\r\nrelegation of all troublesome reforms to the morrow, was no doubt\r\nlargely to blame. But Godoy, the all-powerful favourite who had also\r\nbeen commander-in-chief for the last seven years, must take the main\r\nresponsibility. If he had chosen, he possessed the power to change\r\neverything; and in some ways he had peddled a good deal with details,\r\nchanging the uniforms, and increasing the number of battalions in each\r\nregiment. But to make the army efficient he had done very little:\r\nthe fact was that the commander-in-chief was quite ignorant of the\r\nmilitary needs and tendencies of the day: all his knowledge of the army\r\nwas gained while carpet-soldiering in the ranks of the royal bodyguard.\r\nIt was natural that the kind of officers who commended themselves to\r\nhis haughty and ignorant mind should be those who were most ready to\r\ndo him homage, to wink at his peculations, to condone his jobs, and to\r\nrefrain from worrying him for the money needed for reforms and repairs.\r\nPromotion was wholly arbitrary, and was entirely in the favourite’s\r\nhands. Those who were prepared to bow down to him prospered: those who\r\nshowed any backbone or ventured on remonstrances were shelved. After\r\na few years of this system it was natural that all ranks of the army\r\nbecame demoralized, since not merit but the talents of the courtier\r\nand the flatterer were the sure road to prosperity. Hence it came to\r\npass that when the insurrection began, the level of military ability,\r\npatriotism, and integrity among the higher ranks of the army was very\r\nlow. There were a few worthy men like Castaños and La Romana in offices\r\nof trust, but a much greater proportion of Godoy’s protégés. One cannot\r\ncondone the shocking way in which, during the first days of the war,\r\nthe populace and the rank and file of the army united to murder so\r\nmany officers in high place, like Filanghieri, the Captain-General of\r\nGalicia, Torre del Fresno, the Captain-General of Estremadura, and\r\nSolano, who commanded at Cadiz. But the explanation of the atrocities\r\nis simple: the multitude were resenting the results of the long\r\nadministration of Godoy’s creatures, and fell upon such of them as\r\nrefused to throw in their lot immediately with the insurrection. The\r\nmurdered men were (rightly or wrongly) suspected either of an intention\r\nto submit to Joseph Bonaparte, or of a design to hang back, wait on\r\nthe times, and make their decision only when it should become obvious\r\nwhich paid better, patriotism or servility. The people had considerable\r\njustification in the fact that a very large proportion of Godoy’s\r\nprotégés, especially of those at Madrid, did swear homage to the\r\nintruder in order to keep their places and pensions. They were the base\r\nof the miserable party of _Afrancesados_ which brought so much disgrace\r\non Spain. The misguided cosmopolitan liberals who joined them were much\r\nthe smaller half of the traitor-faction.\r\n\r\nGodoy and his clique, therefore, must take the main responsibility\r\nfor the state of decay and corruption in which the Spanish army was\r\nfound in 1808. What more could be expected when for so many years\r\nan idle, venal, dissolute, ostentatious upstart had been permitted\r\nto control the administration of military affairs, and to settle\r\nall promotions to rank and office? ‘Like master like man’ is always\r\na true proverb, and the officers who begged or bought responsible\r\npositions from Godoy naturally followed their patron’s example in\r\nspreading jobs and peculation downwards. The undrilled and half-clothed\r\nsoldiery, the unhorsed squadrons, the empty arsenals, the idle and\r\nignorant subalterns, were all, in the end, the result of Godoy’s long\r\ndomination. But we do not wish to absolve from its share of blame the\r\npurblind nation which tolerated him for so long. In another country he\r\nwould have gone the way of Gaveston or Mortimer long before.\r\n\r\nWhen this was the state of the Spanish armies, it is no wonder that\r\nthe British observer, whether officer or soldier, could never get over\r\nhis prejudice against them. It was not merely because a Spanish army\r\nwas generally in rags and on the verge of starvation that he despised\r\nit. These were accidents of war which every one had experienced in his\r\nown person: a British battalion was often tattered and hungry. The\r\nSpanish government was notoriously poor, its old regiments had been\r\nrefilled again and again with raw conscripts, its new levies had never\r\nhad a fair start. Hence came the things which disgusted the average\r\nPeninsular diarist of British origin--the shambling indiscipline, the\r\nvoluntary dirt, the unmilitary habits of the Spanish troops. He could\r\nnot get over his dislike for men who kept their arms in a filthy, rusty\r\ncondition, who travelled not in orderly column of route but like a\r\nflock of sheep straggling along a high road, who obeyed their officers\r\nonly when they pleased. And for the officers themselves the English\r\nobserver had an even greater contempt: continually we come across\r\nobservations to the effect that the faults of the rank and file might\r\nbe condoned--after all they were only half-trained peasants--but that\r\nthe officers were the source and fount of evil from their laziness,\r\ntheir arrogance, their ignorance, and their refusal to learn from\r\nexperience. Here is a typical passage from the Earl of Munster’s\r\n_Reminiscences_:--\r\n\r\n‘We should not have been dissatisfied with our allies, _malgré_ their\r\nappearance and their rags, if we had felt any reason to confide in\r\nthem. The men might be “capable of all that men dare,” but the\r\nappearance of their officers at once bespoke their not being fit to\r\nlead them in the attempt. They not only did not look like soldiers,\r\nbut even not like gentlemen, and it was difficult from their mean and\r\nabject appearance, particularly among the infantry, to guess what class\r\nof society they could have been taken from. Few troops will behave well\r\nif those to whom they should look up are undeserving respect. Besides\r\ntheir general inefficiency we found their moral feeling different from\r\nwhat we expected. Far from evincing devotion or even common courage\r\nin their country’s cause, they were very often guilty, individually\r\nand collectively, of disgraceful cowardice. We hourly regretted that\r\nthe revolution had not occasioned a more complete _bouleversement_ of\r\nsociety, so as to bring forward fresh and vigorous talent from all\r\nclasses. Very few of the regular military showed themselves worthy of\r\ncommand. Indeed, with the exception of a few self-made soldiers among\r\nthe Guerillas, who had risen from among the farmers and peasantry, it\r\nwould be hard to point out a Spanish officer whose opinion on the most\r\ntrivial military subject was worth being asked. We saw old besotted\r\ngenerals whose armies were formed on obsolete principles of the _ancien\r\nrégime_ of a decrepit government. To this was added blind pride and\r\nvanity. No proofs of inferiority could open their eyes, and they rushed\r\nfrom one error and misfortune to another, benefiting by no experience,\r\nand disdaining to seek aid and improvement’ [pp. 194-5].\r\n\r\nA voice from the ranks, Sergeant Surtees of the Rifle Brigade, gives\r\nthe same idea in different words.\r\n\r\n‘Most of the Spanish officers appeared to be utterly unfit and\r\nunable to command their men. They had all the pride, arrogance, and\r\nself-sufficiency of the best officers in the world, with the very least\r\nof all pretension to have a high opinion of themselves. It is true they\r\nwere not all alike, but the majority were the most haughty, and at the\r\nsame time the most contemptible creatures in the shape of officers that\r\never I beheld’ [p. 109].\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the class of officers in Spain was filled up\r\nin three different ways. One-third of them were, by custom, drawn\r\nfrom the ranks. In an army raised by conscription from all strata\r\nof society excellent officers can be procured in this way. But in\r\none mainly consisting of the least admirable part of the surplus\r\npopulation, forced by want or hatred of work into enlisting, it was\r\nhard to get even good sergeants. And the sergeants made still worse\r\nsub-lieutenants, when the colonel was forced to promote some of them.\r\nNo wonder that the English observer thought that there were ‘Spanish\r\nofficers who did not look like gentlemen.’ This class were seldom\r\nor never allowed to rise above the grade of captain. The remaining\r\ntwo-thirds of the officers received their commissions from the war\r\noffice: in the cavalry they were supposed to show proofs of noble\r\ndescent, but this was not required in the infantry. There was a\r\nlarge sprinkling, however, of men of family, and for them the best\r\nplaces and the higher ranks were generally reserved--a thing feasible\r\nbecause all promotion was arbitrary, neither seniority nor merit\r\nbeing necessarily considered. The rest were drawn from all classes of\r\nsociety: for the last fifteen years any toady of Godoy could beg or\r\nbuy as many commissions for his protégés as he pleased. But a large,\r\nand not the worst, part of the body of officers was composed of the\r\ndescendants of soldiers of fortune--Irishmen were most numerous, but\r\nthere were also French and Italians--who had always been seen in great\r\nnumbers in the Spanish army. They held most of the upper-middle grades\r\nin the regiments, for the promoted sergeants were kept down to the\r\nrank of captain, while the nobles got rapid promotion and soon rose\r\nto be colonels and generals. On the whole we cannot doubt that there\r\nwas a mass of bad officers in the Spanish army: the ignorant fellows\r\nwho had risen from the ranks, the too-rapidly promoted scions of the\r\nnoblesse, and the nominees of Godoy’s hangers-on, were none of them\r\nvery promising material with which to conduct a war _à outrance_ for\r\nthe existence of the realm.\r\n\r\nIn 1808 there was but one small military college for the training of\r\ninfantry and cavalry officers. Five existed in 1790, but Godoy cut them\r\ndown to one at Zamora, and only allowed sixty cadets there at a time,\r\nso that five-sixths of the young men who got commissions went straight\r\nto their battalions, there to pick up (if they chose) the rudiments of\r\ntheir military education. From want of some common teaching the drill\r\nand organization of the regiments were in a condition of chaos. Every\r\ncolonel did what he chose in the way of manual exercise and manœuvres.\r\nA French officer says that in 1807 he saw a Spanish brigade at a\r\nreview, in which, when the brigadier gave the order ‘Ready, present,\r\nfire!’ the different battalions carried it out in three different\r\ntimes and with wholly distinct details of execution.\r\n\r\nNot only was the Spanish army indifferently officered, but even of\r\nsuch officers as it possessed there were not enough. In the old line\r\nregiments there should have been seventy to each corps, i.e. 2,450 to\r\nthe 105 battalions of that arm. But Godoy had allowed the numbers to\r\nsink to 1,520. When the insurrection broke out, the vacant places had\r\nto be filled, and many regiments received at the same moment twenty\r\nor thirty subalterns taken from civil life and completely destitute\r\nof military training. Similarly the militia ought to have had 1,800\r\nofficers, and only possessed 1,200 when the war began. The vacancies\r\nwere filled, but with raw and often indifferent material.\r\n\r\nSuch were the officers with whom the British army had to co-operate.\r\nThere is no disguising the fact that from the first the allies could\r\nnot get on together. In the earlier years of the war there were some\r\nincidents that happened while the troops of the two nations lay\r\ntogether, which our countrymen could never forgive or forget. We\r\nneed only mention the midnight panic in Cuesta’s army on the eve of\r\nTalavera, when 10,000 men ran away without having had a shot fired at\r\nthem, and the cowardly behaviour of La Peña in 1811, when he refused to\r\naid Graham at the bloody little battle of Barossa.\r\n\r\nThe strictures of Wellington, Napier, and the rest were undoubtedly\r\nwell deserved; and yet it is easy to be too hard on the Spaniards. It\r\nchanced that our countrymen did not get a fair opportunity of observing\r\ntheir allies under favourable conditions; of the old regular army\r\nthat fought at Baylen or Zornoza they never got a glimpse. It had\r\nbeen practically destroyed before we came upon the field. La Romana’s\r\nstarving hordes, and Cuesta’s evasive and demoralized battalions\r\nwere the samples from which the whole Spanish army was judged. In\r\nthe Talavera campaign, the first in which English and Spanish troops\r\nstood side by side, there can be no doubt that the latter (with few\r\nexceptions) behaved in their very worst style. They often did much\r\nbetter; but few Englishmen had the chance of watching a defence like\r\nthat of Saragossa or Gerona. Very few observers from our side saw\r\nanything of the heroically obstinate resistance of the Catalonian\r\n_miqueletes_ and _somatenes_. Chance threw in our way Cuesta and La\r\nPeña and Imaz as types of Peninsular generals, and from them the\r\nrest were judged. No one supposes that the Spaniards as a nation are\r\ndestitute of all military qualities. They made good soldiers enough\r\nin the past, and may do so in the future: but when, after centuries\r\nof intellectual and political torpor, they were called upon to fight\r\nfor their national existence, they were just emerging from subjection\r\nto one of the most worthless adventurers and one of the most idiotic\r\nkings whom history has known. Charles IV and Godoy account for an\r\nextraordinary amount of the decrepitude of the monarchy and the\r\ndemoralization of its army.\r\n\r\nIt is more just to admire the constancy with which a nation so\r\nhandicapped persisted in the hopeless struggle, than to condemn it for\r\nthe incapacity of its generals, the ignorance of its officers, the\r\nunsteadiness of its raw levies. If Spain had been a first-rate military\r\npower, there would have been comparatively little merit in the six\r\nyears’ struggle which she waged against Bonaparte. When we consider her\r\nweakness and her disorganization, we find ourselves more inclined to\r\nwonder at her persistence than to sneer at her mishaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH ARMY IN SPAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. THE ARMY OF 1808: ITS CHARACTER AND ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the history of the imperial armies in the Peninsula,\r\nit is our first duty to point out the enormous difference between the\r\ntroops who entered Spain in 1807 and 1808, under Dupont, Moncey, and\r\nMurat, and the later arrivals who came under Bonaparte’s personal\r\nguidance when the first disastrous stage of the war was over.\r\n\r\nNothing can show more clearly the contempt which the Emperor\r\nentertained, not only for the Spanish government but for the Spanish\r\nnation, than the character of the hosts which he first sent forth\r\nto occupy the Peninsula. After Tilsit he was the master of half a\r\nmillion of the best troops in the world; but he did not consider the\r\nsubjugation of Spain and Portugal a sufficiently formidable task to\r\nmake it necessary to move southward any appreciable fraction of the\r\nGrand Army. The victors of Jena and Friedland were left in their\r\ncantonments on the Rhine, the Elbe, and the Oder, while a new force,\r\nmainly composed of elements of inferior fighting value, was sent across\r\nthe Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nThis second host was at Napoleon’s disposition mainly owing to the fact\r\nthat during the late war he had been anticipating the conscription.\r\nIn the winter of 1806-7 he had called out, a year too soon, the men\r\nwho were due to serve in 1808. In the late autumn of 1807, while his\r\ndesigns in Spain were already in progress, he had summoned forth the\r\nconscription of 1809. He had thus under arms two years’ contingents of\r\nrecruits raised before their proper time. The dépôts were gorged, and,\r\neven after the corps which had been depleted in Prussia and Poland had\r\nbeen made up to full strength, there was an enormous surplus of men in\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nTo utilize this mass of conscripts the Emperor found several ways. Of\r\nthe men raised in the winter of 1806-7 some thousands had been thrown\r\ninto temporary organizations, called ‘legions of reserve,’ and used\r\nto do garrison duty on the Atlantic coast, in order to guard against\r\npossible English descents. There were five of these ‘legions’ and two\r\n‘supplementary legions’ in the army sent into Spain: they showed a\r\nstrength of 16,000 men. None of them had been more than a year under\r\narms, but they were at any rate organized units complete in themselves.\r\nThey formed the greater part of the infantry in the corps of Dupont.\r\n\r\nA shade worse in composition were twenty ‘provisional regiments’ which\r\nthe Emperor put together for Spain. Each regimental dépôt in the south\r\nof France was told to form four companies from its superabundant mass\r\nof conscripts. These bodies, of about 560 men each, were united in\r\nfours, and each group was called a ‘provisional regiment.’ The men of\r\neach battalion knew nothing of those of the others, since they were all\r\ndrawn from separate regiments: there was not a single veteran soldier\r\nin the ranks: the officers were almost all either half-pay men called\r\nback to service, or young sub-lieutenants who had just received their\r\ncommissions. These bodies, equally destitute of _esprit de corps_ and\r\nof instruction, made up nearly 30,000 men of the army of Spain. They\r\nconstituted nearly the whole of the divisions under Bessières and\r\nMoncey, which lay in Northern Spain at the moment of the outbreak of\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nBut there were military units even less trustworthy than the\r\n‘provisional regiments’ which Napoleon transferred to Spain in the\r\nspring of 1808. These were the five or six _régiments de marche_, which\r\nwere to be found in some of the brigades which crossed the Pyrenees\r\nwhen the state of affairs was already growing dangerous. They were\r\nformed of companies, or even smaller bodies, hastily drawn together\r\nfrom such southern dépôts, as were found to be still in possession of\r\nsuperfluous conscripts even after contributing to the ‘provisional\r\nregiments.’ They were to be absorbed into the old corps when the\r\npressing need for instant reinforcements for the Peninsula should come\r\nto an end. In addition to all these temporary units, Bonaparte was\r\nat the same moment making a vast addition to his permanent regular\r\narmy. Down to the war of 1806-7 the French regiments of infantry\r\nhad consisted of three battalions for the field and a fourth at the\r\ndépôt, which kept drafting its men to the front in order to fill up\r\nthe gaps in the other three. Napoleon had now resolved to raise the\r\nestablishment to five battalions per regiment, four for field service,\r\nwhile the newly created fifth became the dépôt battalion. When the\r\nPeninsular War broke out, a good many regiments had already completed\r\ntheir fourth field-battalion, and several of these new corps are to\r\nbe found in the rolls of the armies which had entered Spain. The\r\nmultiplication of battalions had been accompanied by a reduction of\r\ntheir individual strength: down to February, 1808, there were nine\r\ncompanies to each unit, and Junot’s corps had battalions of a strength\r\nof 1,100 or 1,200 bayonets. But those which came later were six-company\r\nbattalions, with a strength of 840 bayonets when at their full\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nAll the troops of which we have hitherto spoken were native Frenchmen.\r\nBut they did not compose by any means the whole of the infantry which\r\nthe Emperor dispatched into Spain between October, 1807, and May, 1808.\r\nAccording to his usual custom he employed great numbers of auxiliaries\r\nfrom his vassal kingdoms: we note intercalated among the French units\r\nseven battalions of Swiss, four of Italians, two each of Neapolitans\r\nand Portuguese[76], and one each of Prussians, Westphalians,\r\nHanoverians, and Irish. Altogether there were no less than 14,000\r\nmen of foreign infantry dispersed among the troops of Junot, Dupont,\r\nBessières, Moncey, and Duhesme. They were not massed, but scattered\r\nbroadcast in single battalions, save the Italians and Neapolitans, who\r\nformed a complete division under Lecchi in the army of Catalonia.\r\n\r\n  [76] These last were the rear battalions of the unfortunate\r\n  Portuguese legion which was in march for the Baltic; they were\r\n  still on this side of the Pyrenees when the war began, and were\r\n  hastily utilized against Saragossa.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry of the army of Spain was quite as heterogeneous and\r\nill compacted as the infantry. Just as ‘provisional regiments’ of\r\nfoot were patched up from the southern dépôts of France, so were\r\n‘provisional regiments’ of cavalry. The best of them were composed\r\nof two, three, or four squadrons, each contributed by the dépôt of\r\na different cavalry regiment. The worst were _escadrons de marche_,\r\ndrawn together in a haphazard fashion from such of the dépôts as had\r\na surplus of conscripts even after they had given a full squadron\r\nto the ‘provisional regiments.’ There were also a number of foreign\r\ncavalry regiments, Italians, Neapolitans, lancers of Berg, and Poles.\r\nOf veteran regiments of French cavalry there were actually no more than\r\nthree, about 1,250 men, among the 12,000 horsemen of the army of Spain.\r\n\r\nWhen we sum up the composition of the 116,000 men who lay south of the\r\nPyrenees on the last day of May, 1808, we find that not a third part\r\nof them belonged to the old units of the regular French army. It may be\r\nworth while to give the figures:--\r\n\r\nOf veterans we have--\r\n\r\n                                                  _Infantry._  _Cavalry._\r\n\r\n  (1) A detachment of the Imperial Guard,\r\n  which was intended to serve as the Emperor’s\r\n  special escort during his irruption into Spain        3,600      1,750\r\n\r\n  (2) Twenty-six battalions of infantry of the\r\n  line and light infantry, being all first, second,\r\n  or third battalions, and not newly raised fourth\r\n  battalions                                           25,800\r\n\r\n  (3) Three old regiments of cavalry of the line                   1,250\r\n\r\n  (4) Three newly raised fourth battalions of\r\n  infantry regiments of the line                        1,800\r\n\r\n  This gives a total of regularly organized            -----------------\r\n  French troops of the standing army of                31,200      3,000\r\n                                                       -----------------\r\n  (5) Five legions of reserve, and two\r\n  ‘supplementary legions of reserve’                   16,000\r\n\r\n  (6) Fifteen ‘provisional regiments’ from the\r\n  dépôts of Southern France [the remaining five\r\n  had not crossed the frontier on May 31]              31,000\r\n\r\n  (7) Six _régiments de marche_ of conscripts           3,200\r\n\r\n  (8) Eighteen battalions of Italian, Swiss,\r\n  German, and other auxiliaries                        14,000\r\n\r\n  (9) Sixteen ‘provisional regiments’ of cavalry,\r\n  and a few detached ‘provisional squadrons,’ and\r\n  _escadrons de marche_                                            9,500\r\n\r\n  (10) Three regiments of foreign cavalry                          1,000\r\n\r\n  This makes a total of troops in temporary            -----------------\r\n  organization, or of foreign origin, of               64,200     10,500\r\n\r\nNapoleon, then, intended to conquer Spain with a force of about 110,000\r\nmen, of which no more than 34,000 sabres and bayonets belonged to\r\nhis regular army; the rest were conscripts or foreign auxiliaries.\r\nBut we must also note that the small body of veteran troops was\r\nnot distributed equally in each of the corps, so as to stiffen the\r\npreponderating mass of conscripts. If we put aside the division of\r\nImperial Guards, we find that of the remaining 25,000 infantry of old\r\norganization no less than 17,500 belonged to Junot’s army of Portugal,\r\nwhich was the only one of the corps that had a solid organization.\r\nJunot had indeed a very fine force, seventeen old line battalions to\r\ntwo battalions of conscripts and three of foreigners. The rest of\r\nthe veteran troops were mainly with Duhesme in Catalonia, who had a\r\ngood division of 5,000 veterans. In the three corps of Dupont, Moncey,\r\nand Bessières on the other hand old troops were conspicuous by their\r\nabsence: among the 19,000 infantry of Dupont’s corps, on which (as it\r\nchanced) the first stress of the Spanish war was destined to fall,\r\nthere was actually only two battalions (1,700 men) of old troops. In\r\nMoncey’s there was not a single veteran unit; in Bessières’, only\r\nfour battalions. This simple fact goes far to explain why Dupont’s\r\nexpedition to Andalusia led to the capitulation of Baylen, and why\r\nMoncey’s march on Valencia ended in an ignominious retreat. Countries\r\ncannot be conquered with hordes of undrilled conscripts--not even\r\ncountries in an advanced stage of political decomposition, such as the\r\nSpain of 1808.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. THE ARMY OF 1808-14: ITS CHARACTER AND ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\nBaylen, as we shall see, taught Napoleon his lesson, and the second\r\narmy which he brought into the Peninsula in the autumn of 1808, to\r\nrepair his initial disasters, was very differently constituted from the\r\nheterogeneous masses which he had at first judged to be sufficient for\r\nhis task. It was composed of his finest old regiments from the Rhine\r\nand Elbe, the flower of the victors of Jena and Friedland. Even when\r\nthe despot had half a million good troops at his disposition, he could\r\nnot be in force everywhere, and the transference of 200,000 veterans to\r\nSpain left him almost too weak in Central Europe. In the Essling-Wagram\r\ncampaign of 1809 he found that he was barely strong enough to conquer\r\nthe Austrians, precisely because he had left so many men behind him\r\nin the Peninsula. In the Russian campaign of 1812, vast as were the\r\nforces that he displayed, they were yet not over numerous for the\r\nenterprise, because such an immense proportion of them was composed of\r\nunwilling allies and disaffected subjects. If the masses of Austrians,\r\nPrussians, Neapolitans, Portuguese, Westphalians, Bavarians, and so\r\nforth had been replaced by half their actual number of old French\r\ntroops from Spain, the army would have been far more powerful. Still\r\nmore was this the case in 1813: if the whole of the Peninsular army had\r\nbeen available for service on the Elbe and Oder at the time of Lützen\r\nand Bautzen, the effect on the general history of Europe might have\r\nbeen incalculable. Truly, therefore, did the Emperor call the Spanish\r\nWar ‘the running sore’ which had sapped his strength ever since its\r\ncommencement.\r\n\r\nA word as to the tactical organization of the French army in 1808 is\r\nrequired. The infantry regiments of normal formation consisted, as we\r\nhave seen, of four field battalions and one dépôt battalion; the last\r\nnamed never, of course, appeared at the front. Each field battalion\r\nwas composed of six companies of 140 men: its two flank companies, the\r\ngrenadiers and voltigeurs, were formed of the pick of the corps[77]:\r\ninto the grenadiers only tall, into the voltigeurs only short men\r\nwere drafted. Thus a battalion should normally have shown 840 and a\r\nregiment 3,360 men in the field. But it was by no means the universal\r\nrule to find the whole four battalions of a regiment serving together.\r\nIn the modern armies of France, Germany, or Russia, a regiment in\r\ntime of peace lives concentrated in its recruiting district, and can\r\ntake the field in a compact body. This was not the case in Napoleon’s\r\never-wandering hosts: the chances of war were always isolating single\r\nbattalions, which, once dropped in a garrison or sent on an expedition,\r\ndid not easily rejoin their fellows. Many, too, of the new fourth\r\nbattalions raised in 1807 had never gone forward to Germany to seek the\r\nmain body of their regiments. Of the corps which were brought down to\r\nSpain in the late autumn of 1808 there were more with three battalions\r\nthan with four concentrated under the regimental eagle. Some had only\r\ntwo present, a few no more than one[78]. But the Emperor disliked to\r\nhave single isolated battalions, and preferred to work them in pairs,\r\nif he could not get three or four together. The object of this was\r\nthat, if one or two battalions got much weakened in a campaign, the\r\nmen could be fused into a single unit, and the supernumerary officers\r\nand sergeants sent back to the dépôt, where they would form a new\r\nbattalion out of the stock of conscripts. But the fresh organization\r\nmight very likely be hurried, by some sudden chance of war, to\r\nFlushing, or Italy, or the Danube, while the eagle and the main body\r\nremained in Spain--or vice versa.\r\n\r\n  [77] French generals were much addicted to the pernicious\r\n  practice of massing the grenadier companies of all the regiments\r\n  of a division, or an army corps, in order to make a picked\r\n  battalion or brigade, to be used as a reserve. Junot had four\r\n  such battalions (_grenadiers réunis_) at Vimiero, and Victor\r\n  three at Barossa.\r\n\r\n  [78] To take a later example, of the three _corps d’armée_ (II,\r\n  VI, VIII) with which Masséna invaded Portugal in 1810, there\r\n  were only _three_ regiments with four battalions present; while\r\n  seventeen had three, eight had two, and ten a single battalion\r\n  only.\r\n\r\nThere was therefore, in consequence of the varying strength of the\r\nregiments, no regularity or system in the brigading of the French\r\ntroops in Spain: in one brigade there might be five or six isolated\r\nbattalions, each belonging to a separate regiment; in another three\r\nfrom one regiment and two from a second; in a third four from one\r\nregiment and one from another. Nor was there any fixed number of\r\nbattalions in a brigade: it might vary from three (a very unusual\r\nminimum) up to nine--an equally rare maximum. Six was perhaps the most\r\nfrequent number. A division was composed of two, or less frequently of\r\nthree, brigades, and might have any number from ten up to sixteen or\r\neighteen battalions--i.e. it varied, allowing for casual losses, from\r\n6,000 to 10,000 men. This irregularity was part of Napoleon’s system:\r\nhe laid it down as an axiom that all military units, from a brigade to\r\nan army corps, ought to differ in strength among themselves: otherwise\r\nthe enemy, if he had once discovered how many brigades or divisions\r\nwere in front of him, could calculate with accuracy the number of\r\ntroops with which he had to do.\r\n\r\nMuch confusion is caused, when we deal with Napoleon’s army, by the\r\nstrange system of numeration which he adopted. The infantry, whether\r\ncalled ‘line regiments’ or ‘light infantry regiments,’ were drilled and\r\norganized in the same way. But the Emperor had some odd vagaries: he\r\noften refused to raise again a regiment which had been exterminated,\r\nor taken prisoners _en masse_. Hence after a few years of his reign\r\nthere were some vacant numbers in the list of infantry corps. The\r\nregiments, for example, which were garrisoning the colonies at the time\r\nof the rupture of the Peace of Amiens, fell one after another into the\r\nhands of the English as the war went on. They were never replaced, and\r\nleft gaps in the army list. On the other hand the Emperor sometimes\r\nraised regiments with duplicate numbers, a most tiresome thing for the\r\nmilitary historian of the next age. It is impossible to fathom his\r\npurpose, unless he was set on confusing his enemies by showing more\r\nbattalions than the list of existing corps seemed to make possible. Or\r\nperhaps he was thinking of the old legions of the Roman Empire, of\r\nwhich there were always several in existence bearing the same number,\r\nbut distinguished by their honorary titles. Those who wish to read the\r\nstory of one of these duplicate regiments may follow in the history of\r\nNodier the tale of the raising and extermination of Colonel Oudet’s\r\ncelebrated ‘9th Bis’ of the line[79].\r\n\r\n  [79] Nodier, _Souvenirs de la Révolution_, ii. 233-5.\r\n\r\nThere is another difficulty caused by a second freak of the Emperor:\r\nall regiments ought, as we have said, to have shown four field\r\nbattalions. But Bonaparte sometimes added one or even two more, to\r\ncorps which stood high in his favour, or whose dépôts produced on some\r\noccasions a very large surplus of conscripts. Thus we find now and\r\nthen, in the morning state of a French army corps, a fifth or even\r\na sixth[80] battalion of some regiment. But as a rule these units\r\nhad not a very long existence: their usual fate was to be sent home,\r\nwhen their numbers ran low from the wear and tear of war, in order\r\nto be incorporated in the normal _cadres_ of their corps. On the\r\nauthority of that good soldier and admirable historian, Foy, we are\r\nable to state that on the first of June, 1808, Napoleon had 417 field\r\nbattalions, over and above the dépôts, on his army rolls. If the 113\r\nregiments of the line, and the thirty-two light infantry regiments had\r\nall been in existence and complete, there should have been 580 field\r\nbattalions. Clearly then some corps had disappeared and many others\r\nhad not more than three battalions ready. But the units were always\r\nbeing created, amalgamated, or dissolved, from week to week, so that\r\nit is almost impossible to state the exact force of the whole French\r\narmy at any given moment. The most important change that was made\r\nduring the year 1808 was the conversion of those of the provisional\r\nregiments which escaped Dupont’s disaster into new permanent corps.\r\nBy combining them in pairs the 114th-120th of the line and the 33rd\r\nléger were created[81]. In the succeeding five years more and more\r\ncorps were raised: the annexation of Holland and Northern Germany in\r\n1810-11 ultimately enabled the Emperor to carry the total of his line\r\nregiments up to 156 [1813], and of his light infantry regiments up to\r\nthirty-six[82].\r\n\r\n  [80] In the campaign of 1810 the 26th, 66th, and 82nd regiments\r\n  in Masséna’s army had 5th and 6th battalions in the field.\r\n\r\n  [81] This was done on July 7 (see _Nap. Corresp._, 14,164). Nos.\r\n  1 and 2 became the 114th of the line, 3 and 4 the 115th, 5 and\r\n  6 the 116th, 7 and 8 the 33rd léger, 9 and 10 the 117th, 11 the\r\n  118th, 13 and 14 the 119th, 17 and 18 the 120th. When the 6th,\r\n  7th, and 8th were captured at Baylen, new conscripts had to be\r\n  brought from France to complete the 116th and replace the 33rd\r\n  léger.\r\n\r\n  [82] See Rousset’s excellent _La Grande Armée de 1813_.\r\n\r\nOf the French cavalry we need not speak at such length. When the\r\nSpanish war broke out, Bonaparte was possessed of about eighty\r\nregiments of horsemen, each taking the field with four squadrons of\r\nsome 150 to 200 men. There were twelve regiments of cuirassiers, two of\r\ncarabineers, thirty of dragoons, twenty-six of _chasseurs à cheval_,\r\nten of hussars, i.e. fourteen regiments of heavy, thirty of medium, and\r\nthirty-six of light horse. The cuirassiers were hardly ever seen in\r\nSpain--not more than two or three regiments ever served south of the\r\nPyrenees[83]. On the other hand the greater part of the dragoons were\r\nemployed in the Peninsula--there were in 1809 twenty-five of the thirty\r\nregiments of them in the field against the English and Spaniards.\r\nMore than half of the hussars also served in Spain. To the veteran\r\ncorps of regulars there were added, at the outset of the war, as will\r\nbe remembered, a great number of ‘provisional regiments,’ but these\r\ngradually disappeared, by being incorporated in the older _cadres_, or\r\nin a few cases by being formed into new permanent units. There was also\r\na mass of Polish, German, and Italian cavalry; but these auxiliaries\r\ndid not bear such a high proportion to the native French as did the\r\nforeign part of the infantry arm. By far the most distinguished of\r\nthese corps were the Polish lancers, whom the English came to know only\r\ntoo well at Albuera. The Italians were almost exclusively employed on\r\nthe east coast of Spain, in the army of Catalonia. The Germans--mostly\r\nfrom Westphalia, Berg, and Nassau--were scattered about in single\r\nregiments among the cavalry corps of the various armies. They were\r\nalways mixed with the French horse, and never appeared in brigades\r\n(much less in divisions) of their own.\r\n\r\n  [83] The most distinguished of these was the 13th Cuirassiers,\r\n  a regiment of new formation, which served throughout the war in\r\n  Aragon and Catalonia, and was by far the best of Suchet’s mounted\r\n  corps. For its achievements the reader may be referred to the\r\n  interesting _Mémoires_ of Colonel de Gonneville.\r\n\r\nThe average strength of a French cavalry regiment during the years\r\n1809-14 was four squadrons of about 150 men each. It was very seldom\r\nthat a corps showed over 600 men in the ranks: not unfrequently it\r\nsank to 450[84]. When it grew still further attenuated, it was usual\r\nto send back the _cadres_ of one or two squadrons, and to complete to\r\nfull numbers the two or three which kept the field. These figures do\r\nnot hold good for the raw ‘provisional regiments’ which Bonaparte used\r\nduring the first year of the war: they sometimes rose to 700 or even\r\n800 strong, when the dépôts from which they had been drawn chanced to\r\nbe exceptionally full of recruits[85]. But such large corps are not to\r\nbe found in the later years of the war. By 1812, when Napoleon, busied\r\nin Central Europe, ceased to reinforce his Spanish armies, the average\r\nof a cavalry regiment had shrunk to 500 men. In 1813 it was seldom that\r\n400 effective sabres could be mustered by any mounted corps.\r\n\r\n  [84] In Masséna’s army of 1810 the largest cavalry regiment (25th\r\n  Dragoons) had 650 men. In Suchet’s army in the same year there\r\n  was one exceptionally strong regiment (4th Hussars) with 759\r\n  sabres.\r\n\r\n  [85] The 2nd Provisional Dragoons of Moncey’s corps had no less\r\n  than 872 men in June, 1808.\r\n\r\nAs to the scientific arms of the French service, the artillery and\r\nengineers, there is no doubt that throughout the war they deserved very\r\nwell of their master. Artillery cannot be improvised in the manner that\r\nis possible with infantry, and the batteries which accompanied Dupont’s\r\nand Moncey’s conscripts into Spain in 1808 were veterans. Without them\r\nthe raw infantry would have fared even worse than it did, during the\r\nfirst year of the struggle. The proportion of guns which the French\r\nemployed during the wars of the Empire was generally very large in\r\ncomparison with the size of their armies--one of the many results of\r\nthe fact that Bonaparte had originally been an artillery officer. He\r\nraised, as was remarked, the number of gunners in the French service\r\nto a figure as large as that of the whole regular army of Louis XVI at\r\nthe moment when the Revolution broke out. But in Spain the difficulties\r\nof transport and the badness of the roads seem to have combined to\r\nkeep down the proportion of guns to something very much less than\r\nwas customary in the more favourable _terrain_ of Italy or Germany.\r\nA large part, too, of the pieces were of very light metal--four- and\r\neven three-pounders, which were found easier to transport across the\r\nmountains than six- or eight-pounders, though much less effective in\r\nthe field. In many of the campaigns, therefore, of the Peninsular War\r\nthe French artillery stood in a proportion to the total number of men\r\npresent, which was so low that it barely exceeded that customary among\r\nthe British, who were notoriously more ‘under-gunned’ than any other\r\nEuropean army save that of Spain. Junot at Vimiero had twenty-three\r\nguns to 13,500 men: Victor at Talavera had eighty guns to about 50,000\r\nmen: Masséna in 1810 invaded Portugal with some 70,000 men and 126\r\nguns; at Fuentes d’Oñoro he only showed forty-two guns to 40,000\r\nbayonets and sabres[86]. Soult at Albuera had (apparently) forty guns\r\nto 24,000 men: in the autumn campaign of 1813 the same marshal had 125\r\nguns to 107,000 men. It will be noted that the proportion never rises\r\nto two guns per thousand men, and occasionally does not much exceed one\r\ngun per thousand[87]. This contrasts remarkably with the 350 guns to\r\n120,000 men which Bonaparte took out for the campaign of Waterloo, or\r\neven with the 1,372 guns to 600,000 men of the Russian expedition and\r\n1,056 guns to 450,000 men of the ill-compacted army of 1813.\r\n\r\n  [86] In this case the low proportion was due to want of horses,\r\n  not to bad roads. Even the forty-two guns were only produced when\r\n  Bessières had lent Masséna many teams.\r\n\r\n  [87] I take these figures respectively from Thiébault, Fririon,\r\n  Lapène, Le Clerc, and Rousset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II: CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE TACTICS OF THE FRENCH AND THEIR ADVERSARIES\r\nDURING THE PENINSULAR WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nAn account of the numbers and the organization of an army is of\r\ncomparatively little interest, unless we understand the principles on\r\nwhich its leaders are accustomed to handle it on the day of battle, and\r\nits value as a fighting machine.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, the tactics of the French infantry during the\r\nPeninsular War were those which had been developed fifteen years\r\nbefore, during the first struggles of the Revolution. They nearly\r\nalways attacked with a thick cloud of tirailleurs covering one or two\r\nlines of battalions in column. The idea was that the very numerous\r\nand powerful skirmishing line would engage the enemy sufficiently to\r\nattract all his attention, so that the massed battalions behind arrived\r\nat the front of battle almost without sustaining loss. The momentum\r\nof the columns ought then to suffice to carry them right through the\r\nenemy’s lines, which would already have suffered appreciably from\r\nthe fire of the tirailleurs. This form of attack had won countless\r\nvictories over Prussian, Austrian, and Russian; and many cases had been\r\nknown where a hostile position had been carried by the mere impetus\r\nof the French columns, without a shot having been fired save by their\r\nskirmishers. But this method, which Wellington called ‘the old French\r\nstyle,’ never succeeded against the English. It had the fatal defect\r\nthat when the column came up through the tirailleurs and endeavoured\r\nto charge, it presented a small front, and only the first two ranks\r\ncould fire. For the normal French battalion advanced in column of\r\ncompanies, or less frequently of double companies, i.e. with a front\r\nof forty or at most of eighty men, and a depth of nine or of eighteen,\r\nsince the company was always three deep, and there were six companies\r\nto a battalion. The rear ranks only served to give the front ranks\r\nmoral support, and to impress the enemy with a sense of the solidity\r\nand inexorable strength of the approaching mass. Sometimes a whole\r\nregiment or brigade formed one dense column. Now if the enemy, as was\r\nalways the case with the British, refused to be impressed, but stood\r\nfirm in line, held their ground, and blazed into the head of the mass,\r\nthe attack was certain to fail. For 800 men in the two-deep line,\r\nwhich Wellington loved, could all use their muskets, and thus poured\r\n800 bullets per volley into a French battalion of the same strength,\r\nwhich only could return 160. The nine-deep, or eighteen-deep, column\r\nwas a target which it was impossible to miss. Hence the front ranks\r\nwent down in rows and the whole came to a standstill. If, as was often\r\nthe case, the French battalion tried to deploy in front of the English\r\nline, so as to bring more muskets to bear, it seldom or never succeeded\r\nin accomplishing the manœuvre, for each company, as it straggled out\r\nfrom the mass, got shot down so quickly that the formation could never\r\nbe completed. No wonder that Foy in his private journal felt himself\r\nconstrained to confess that, for a set battle with equal numbers on a\r\nlimited front, the English infantry was superior. ‘I keep this opinion\r\nto myself,’ he adds, ‘and have never divulged it; for it is necessary\r\nthat the soldier in the ranks should not only hate the enemy, but also\r\ndespise him[88].’ Foy kept his opinion so closely to himself that he\r\ndid not put it in his formal history of the Peninsular War: it has only\r\nbecome public property since his journals were published in 1900.\r\n\r\n  [88] Diary of Foy, in Girod de l’Ain’s _Vie Militaire du Général\r\n  Foy_, p. 98.\r\n\r\nBut the fact that with anything like equal numbers the line must beat\r\nthe column was demonstrated over and over again during the war. It had\r\nfirst been seen at Maida in 1806, but that obscure Calabrian battle\r\nwas hardly known, even by name, save to those who had been present.\r\nIt was at Talavera, and still more at Busaco and Albuera, that it\r\nbecame patent to everybody that the attack in battalion column, even\r\nif preceded by a vigorous swarm of skirmishers, could never succeed\r\nagainst the English. At the two former fights the French attacked\r\nuphill, and laid the blame of their defeat upon the unfavourable\r\nground. But when at Albuera three English brigades drove double their\r\nown numbers from the commanding ridge on which Soult had ranged them,\r\nsimply by the superiority of their musketry fire, there was no longer\r\nany possibility of disguising the moral. Yet to the end of the war,\r\ndown to Waterloo itself, the French stuck to their old formation: at\r\nthe great battle in 1815, as Wellington tersely said, ‘The French came\r\non once more in the old style, and we beat them in the old style.’\r\n\r\nBut when Napoleon’s armies were opposed to troops who could not stand\r\nfirm to meet them in a line formation, they generally succeeded. The\r\nSpaniards, in their earlier battles, often tried to resist in a line of\r\ndeployed battalions, but their _morale_ was not good enough when the\r\nattacking column drew close to them, and they generally gave way at the\r\ncritical moment and let their assailants break through[89]. The same\r\nhad often been the case with the Austrians and Prussians, who in their\r\nearlier wars with Napoleon used the line formation which Frederick the\r\nGreat had popularized fifty years before. The great king had accustomed\r\nhis troops to fight in a three- or four-deep line, with a comparatively\r\nsmall provision of skirmishers to cover their front, for it was by the\r\nfire of the whole battalion that his troops were intended to win. The\r\nmasses of tirailleurs which the French sent forward in front of their\r\ncolumns generally succeeded in engaging the Prussian or Austrian line\r\nso closely, that the columns behind them came up without much loss, and\r\nthen broke the line by their mere momentum and moral effect. Hence in\r\ntheir later wars the German powers copied their enemies, and took to\r\nusing a very thick skirmishing line backed by battalion columns in the\r\nFrench style.\r\n\r\n  [89] The reader who wishes to see a logical explanation of the\r\n  phenomenon may find it in the remarks of the Spanish Colonel\r\n  Moscoso (1812) in Arteche, ii. 394. He explains that the\r\n  skirmishing line of his compatriots was always too thin to\r\n  keep back the tirailleurs. The latter invariably pushed their\r\n  way close up to the Spanish main body, and while presenting in\r\n  their scattered formation no definite mark for volleys, were yet\r\n  numerous enough to shoot down so many of their opponents as to\r\n  shake the Spanish formation before the columns in the rear came\r\n  up.\r\n\r\nWellington never found any reason to do so. His method was to conceal\r\nhis main line as long as possible by a dip in the ground, a hedge,\r\nor a wall, or to keep it behind the crest of the position which it\r\nwas holding. To face the tirailleurs each battalion sent out its\r\nlight company, and each brigade had assigned to it several detached\r\ncompanies of riflemen: from 1809 onward some of the 60th Rifles and one\r\nor two foreign light corps[90] were broken up and distributed round\r\nthe various divisions for this special purpose. This gave a line of\r\nskirmishers strong enough to hold back the tirailleurs for a long time,\r\nprobably till the supporting columns came up to help them. It was only\r\nthen that the British skirmishing line gave way and retired behind\r\nits main body, leaving the deployed battalions in face of the French\r\ncolumn, of which they never failed to give a satisfactory account.\r\nThe covering screen of light troops often suffered terribly; e.g., at\r\nBarossa, Brown’s ‘light battalion’ lost fourteen out of twenty-one\r\nofficers and more than half its rank and file[91], while holding off\r\nthe French advance from the line which was forming in its rear. But the\r\ncombat always went well if the enemy’s skirmishers could be kept back,\r\nand his supporting columns forced to come to the front, to engage with\r\nthe regiments in two-deep formation which were waiting for them.\r\n\r\n  [90] e.g. _Brunswick-Oels_ and the _Chasseurs Britanniques_.\r\n\r\n  [91] See Blakeney, _A Boy in the Peninsular War_, edited by\r\n  Sturges (1899), pp. 189, 190, for an account of this bloody\r\n  episode.\r\n\r\nCharges with the bayonet are often heard of in narratives--especially\r\nFrench narratives--of the Peninsular War. But it was very seldom that\r\nthe opposing troops actually came into collision with the white weapon.\r\nThere were occasions, almost invariably in fighting in villages or\r\nenclosed ground, on which considerable numbers of men were killed\r\nor wounded with the bayonet, but they were but few. It is certain,\r\nhowever, that the 43rd at Vimiero, the 71st and 88th at Fuentes\r\nd’Oñoro, and the 20th at Roncesvalles, engaged in this fashion[92];\r\nand other cases could be quoted. But as a rule a ‘bayonet charge’ in\r\na French historian merely means the advance of a column up to the\r\nenemy’s position without firing: it does not imply actual contact\r\nor the crossing of weapons. An English charge on the other hand was\r\npractically an advance in line with frequent volleys, or independent\r\nfile-firing. At Albuera, or Barossa, or Salamanca it was the ball not\r\nthe bayonet which did the work; the enemy was shot down, or gave way\r\nwithout any hand-to-hand conflict.\r\n\r\n  [92] The reader who is curious as to details of actual\r\n  bayonet-fighting may consult Grattan for the 88th, and the\r\n  anonymous ‘T.S.’ of the 71st for Fuentes d’Oñoro, and Steevens of\r\n  the 20th for Roncesvalles. The charge of Tovey’s company of the\r\n  latter corps, on the last-mentioned occasion, much resembled one\r\n  of the incidents of Inkerman.\r\n\r\nFrench cavalry tactics had by 1808 developed into as definite a system\r\nas those of the infantry. Napoleon was fond of massing his horsemen\r\nin very large bodies and launching them at the flank, or even at the\r\ncentre, of the army opposed to him. He would occasionally use as many\r\nas 6,000 or 8,000, or (as at Waterloo) even 12,000 men for one of\r\nthese great strokes. Two or three of his famous battles were won by\r\ntremendous cavalry charges--notably Marengo and Dresden, while Eylau\r\nwas just saved from falling into a disaster by a blow of the same\r\nkind. But cavalry must be used at precisely the right moment, must be\r\nskilfully led and pushed home without remorse, and even then it may be\r\nbeaten off by thoroughly cool and unshaken troops. It is only against\r\ntired, distracted, or undisciplined battalions that it can count on a\r\nreasonable certainty of success. All through the war the Spanish armies\r\nsupplied the French horsemen with exactly the opportunities that they\r\nrequired: they were always being surprised, or caught in confusion\r\nwhile executing some complicated manœuvre; and as if this was not\r\nenough, they were often weak enough in _morale_ to allow themselves to\r\nbe broken even when they had been allowed time to take their ground\r\nand form their squares. The battles of Gamonal (1808), Medellin, Alba\r\nde Tormes, and Ocaña (1809), the Gebora, and Saguntum (1811) were good\r\nexamples of the power of masses of horse skilfully handled over a\r\nnumerous but ill-disciplined infantry.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, against the English the French cavalry hardly ever\r\naccomplished anything worthy of note. It is only possible to name two\r\noccasions on which they made their mark: the first was at Albuera,\r\nwhere, profiting by an opportune cloud-burst which darkened the face\r\nof day, two regiments of lancers came in upon the flank of a British\r\nbrigade (Colborne’s of the second division), and almost entirely cut it\r\nto pieces. The second incident of the kind was at Fuentes d’Oñoro, in\r\nthe same summer, when Montbrun’s cavalry charged with some effect on\r\nHouston’s division and hustled it back for some two miles, though they\r\nnever succeeded in breaking its squares.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the cases where the French horsemen found themselves\r\nutterly unable to deal with the British infantry were very numerous--we\r\nneed only mention Cacabellos (during Moore’s retreat), El Bodon,\r\nSalamanca, and several skirmishes during the retreat from Burgos in\r\n1812. After such experiences it was no wonder that Foy, and other old\r\nofficers of the army of Spain, looked with dismay upon Napoleon’s great\r\nattempt at Waterloo to break down the long line of British squares\r\nbetween La Haye Sainte and Hougoumont, by the charges of ten or twelve\r\nthousand heavy cavalry massed on a short front of less than a mile[93].\r\nThe Emperor had never seen the British infantry fight, and was\r\nentirely ignorant of their resisting power.\r\n\r\n  [93] See Foy’s diary in Girod de l’Ain, p. 277.\r\n\r\nOf fights between cavalry and cavalry, where the two sides were\r\npresent in such equal numbers as to make the struggle a fair test\r\nof their relative efficiency, there were but few in the Peninsular\r\nWar. In the early years of the struggle Wellington was very scantily\r\nprovided with horsemen, and never could afford to engage in a cavalry\r\nbattle on a large scale. Later on, when he was more happily situated\r\nin this respect, he showed such a marked reluctance to risk great\r\ncavalry combats that the old saying that he was ‘pre-eminently an\r\ninfantry general’ seems justified. That he could use his horsemen\r\nvigorously enough, when he saw his opportunity, he showed at Assaye,\r\nlong before he had made his name known in Europe. Yet the only one\r\nof his great battles in Spain where his dragoons took a prominent\r\npart in the victory was Salamanca, where Le Marchant’s brigade struck\r\nsuch a smashing blow on the flank of the French army. We have his own\r\nauthority[94] for the fact that he hesitated to mass great bodies of\r\nhorse, because he doubted the tactical skill of his officers, and the\r\npower of the regiments to manœuvre. ‘I considered our cavalry,’ he\r\nwrote ten years after the war was over, ‘so inferior to the French from\r\nwant of order, that although I considered one squadron a match for two\r\nFrench, I did not like to see four British opposed to four French: and\r\nas the numbers increased and order, of course, became more necessary, I\r\nwas the more unwilling to risk our men without having a superiority in\r\nnumbers. They could gallop, but could not preserve their order.’\r\n\r\n  [94] Letter to Lord William Russell, July 31, 1826.\r\n\r\nFoy, in his excellent history of the Spanish War, emits an opinion\r\nin words curiously similar to those of Wellington, stating that\r\nfor practical purposes the English troopers were inferior to the\r\nFrench on account of their headlong impetuosity and want of power to\r\nmanœuvre[95]. When two such authorities agree, there must clearly\r\nhave been some solid foundation for their verdict. Yet it is hard to\r\nquote many combats in their support: there were cases, no doubt, where\r\nEnglish regiments threw their chances away by their blind fury in\r\ncharging, as did the 23rd Light Dragoons at Talavera, the 13th Light\r\nDragoons near Campo Mayor on March 25, 1811, and Slade’s brigade at\r\nMaguilla on June 11, 1812. Yet with the memory before us of Paget’s\r\nadmirable operations at Sahagun and Benavente in December, 1808, of\r\nLumley’s skilful containing of Latour Maubourg’s superior numbers at\r\nAlbuera, and his brilliant success at Usagre over that same general in\r\n1811, as well as Cotton’s considerable cavalry fight at Villa Garcia in\r\n1812, it seems strange to find Wellington disparaging his own troopers.\r\nNo doubt we must concede that the British horsemen did not show that\r\nmarked superiority over their rivals of the same arm which Wellington’s\r\ninfantry always asserted. But fairly balancing their faults and their\r\nmerits, it would seem that there was something wanting in their general\r\nno less than in themselves. A lover of the cavalry arm would have got\r\nmore profit out of the British horse than Wellington ever obtained. It\r\nis noticeable that not one of the successful fights cited above took\r\nplace under the eye or the direction of the Duke.\r\n\r\n  [95] Foy, i. 288-90.\r\n\r\nAs to the Spanish cavalry, it was (as we have already had occasion to\r\nremark) the weakest point in the national army. In the first actions\r\nof the war it appeared on the field in such small numbers that it had\r\nno chance against the French. But later on, when the juntas succeeded\r\nin raising large masses of horsemen, their scandalous conduct on a\r\nscore of fields was the despair of Spanish generals. We need only\r\nmention Medellin and Ocaña as examples of their misbehaviour. No French\r\ncavalry-general ever hesitated to engage with double of his own number\r\nof Spanish horse. When vigorously charged they never failed to give\r\nway, and when once on the move it was impossible to rally them. It\r\nwas often found on the night of a battle that the mass of the cavalry\r\nwas in flight twenty miles ahead of the infantry, which it had basely\r\ndeserted.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, as every student of the art of war knows, had started his\r\ncareer as an officer of artillery, and never forgot the fact. He\r\nhimself has left on record the statement that of all his tactical\r\nsecrets the concentration of an overwhelming artillery fire on a given\r\npoint was the most important. ‘When once the combat has grown hot,’\r\nhe wrote, ‘the general who has the skill to unite an imposing mass of\r\nartillery, suddenly and without his adversary’s knowledge, in front\r\nof some point of the hostile position, may be sure of success.’ His\r\nleading idea was to secure an overwhelming artillery preparation for\r\nhis infantry attacks: for this reason his typical battle began with\r\nthe massing of a great number of guns on the points of the enemy’s\r\nline which he intended ultimately to break down. In this respect he\r\nabandoned entirely the vicious tactics that prevailed in the earlier\r\nyears of the revolutionary war, when the cannon, instead of being\r\nconcentrated, were distributed about in twos and threes among the\r\ninfantry battalions. We shall find that his method had been perfectly\r\nassimilated by his subordinates: when the ground allowed of it, they\r\nwere much given to collecting many guns at some salient point of the\r\nline, and bringing a concentrated fire to bear on the weak spot in\r\nthe enemy’s position. At Ocaña a battery of this kind had a great\r\nshare in the credit of the victory; at Albuera it saved Soult’s routed\r\ntroops from complete destruction. The names of artillery generals like\r\nSenarmont and Ruty need honourable mention for such achievements. If\r\nthe French artillery had less effect against the English than against\r\nmost of Napoleon’s foes, it was because of Wellington’s admirable\r\ncustom of hiding his troops till the actual moment of battle. Austrian,\r\nRussian, or Prussian generals occupied a hillside by long lines drawn\r\nup on the hither slope, of which every man could be counted. Hence they\r\ncould be thoroughly searched out and battered by the French guns, long\r\nbefore the infantry was let loose. Wellington, on the other hand, loved\r\nto show a position apparently but half-defended, with his reserves, or\r\neven his main line, carefully hidden behind the crest, or covered by\r\nwalls and hedges, or concealed in hollows and ravines. Hence the French\r\nartillery-preparation was much embarrassed: there were no masses to\r\nfire at, and it was impossible to tell how any part of the line was\r\nheld. By the end of the war the French marshals grew very chary of\r\nattacking any position where Wellington showed fight, for they never\r\ncould tell whether they were opposed by a mere rearguard, or by a whole\r\narmy skilfully concealed.\r\n\r\nThe English armies, unlike the French, always took with them a\r\ncomparatively small proportion of artillery, seldom so much as two guns\r\nto the thousand men, as Foy remarks. But what there was was excellent,\r\nfrom its high discipline and the accuracy of its fire. The Duke\r\npreferred to work with small and movable units, placed in well-chosen\r\nspots, and kept dark till the critical moment, rather than with the\r\nenormous lines of guns that Bonaparte believed in. His horse artillery\r\nwas often pushed to the front in the most daring way, in reliance on\r\nits admirable power of manœuvring and its complete steadiness. At\r\nFuentes d’Oñoro, for example, it was made to cover the retreat of the\r\nright wing before the masses of French cavalry, in a way that would\r\nhave seemed impossible to any one who was not personally acquainted\r\nwith Norman Ramsay and his gunners. Hence came the astounding fact that\r\nduring the whole war the Duke never in the open field lost an English\r\ngun. Several times cannon were taken and retaken; once or twice guns\r\nnot belonging to the horse or field batteries were left behind in a\r\nretreat, when transport failed. But in the whole six years of his\r\ncommand Wellington lost no guns in battle. Foy gives an unmistakable\r\ntestimony to the English artillery in his history, by remarking that in\r\nits material it was undoubtedly superior to the French[96]: the same\r\nfact may be verified from the evidence of our own officers, several of\r\nwhom have left their opinion on record, that after having inspected\r\ncaptured French cannon, limbers, and caissons they much preferred their\r\nown.\r\n\r\n  [96] Foy, i. 296.\r\n\r\nThis statement, it must be remembered, only applies to the field and\r\nhorse artillery. The English siege artillery, all through the war,\r\nwas notably inferior to the French. Wellington never possessed a\r\nsatisfactory battering train, and the awful cost at which his sieges\r\nwere turned into successes is a testimony to the inadequacy of his\r\nresources. The infantry were sent in to win, by sheer courage and\r\nat terrible expense of life, the places that could not be reduced\r\nby the ill-equipped siege artillery. There can be no doubt that in\r\npoliorcetics the enemy was our superior: but with a very small number\r\nof artillery officers trained to siege work, an insignificant body\r\nof Royal Engineers[97], and practically no provision of trained\r\nsappers[98], what was to be expected? It was not strange that the\r\nFrench showed themselves our masters in this respect. But the fault\r\nlay with the organization at head quarters, not with the artillery and\r\nengineer officers of the Peninsular army, who had to learn their trade\r\nby experience without having received any proper training at home.\r\n\r\n  [97] It was usual to supplement the meagre supply of engineers by\r\n  officers who volunteered from the line.\r\n\r\n  [98] There were only the ‘Royal Military Artificers’ in very\r\n  small numbers. The rank and file of the engineer corps did not\r\n  yet exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III\r\n\r\nSARAGOSSA AND BAYLEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nOPENING OF HOSTILITIES: THE FRENCH INVASIONS OF ANDALUSIA AND VALENCIA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the provinces of Spain were bursting out, one after another,\r\ninto open insurrection, Murat at Madrid and Bonaparte at Bayonne were\r\nstill enjoying the fools’ paradise in which they had dwelt since the\r\nformal abdication of Ferdinand VII. The former was busy in forcing\r\nthe Junta of Regency to perform the action which he elegantly styled\r\n‘swallowing the pill,’ i.e. in compelling it to do homage to Napoleon\r\nand humbly crave for the appointment of Joseph Bonaparte as King of\r\nSpain. He imagined that his only serious trouble lay in the lamentable\r\nemptiness of the treasury at Madrid, and kept announcing smooth things\r\nto his master--‘The country was tranquil, the state of public opinion\r\nin the capital was far happier than could have been hoped: the native\r\nsoldiery were showing an excellent disposition, the captains-general\r\nkept sending in good reports: the new dynasty was likely to be popular,\r\nand the only desire expressed by the people was to see their newly\r\ndesignated king arrive promptly in their midst[99].’ Letters of this\r\nkind continued to flow from the pen of the Duke of Berg till almost the\r\nend of the month. Even after details of the insurrection of Aragon and\r\nthe Asturias began to reach him, he could write on May 31 that a strong\r\nflying column would suffice to put everything right. About this time he\r\nwas seized by a violent fever and took to his bed, just as things were\r\ncommencing to grow serious. On his convalescence he left for France,\r\nafter putting everything in charge of Savary, the man who of all\r\nFrenchmen most deserved the hatred of Spain. About the middle of June\r\nhe recrossed the French frontier, and after a few weeks went off to\r\nNaples to take up his new kingship there. Spain was never to see him\r\nagain: the catastrophe which he had, by his master’s orders, brought\r\nabout, was to be conducted to its end by other hands.\r\n\r\n  [99] Murat to Napoleon, May 18.\r\n\r\nWhile Murat lay sick at the suburban palace of Chamartin, and while\r\nNapoleon was drafting acts and constitutions which the assembly of\r\nnotables at Bayonne were to accept and publish, the first acts of war\r\nbetween the insurgents and the French army of occupation took place.\r\n\r\nWe have already had occasion to point out that the main military\r\nstrength of the insurrection lay in Galicia and Andalusia, the two\r\ndistricts in which large bodies of regular troops had placed themselves\r\nat the disposition of the newly organized juntas. In Valencia,\r\nCatalonia, and Murcia the movement was much weaker: in Old Castile,\r\nAragon, and the Asturias it had hardly any other forces at its disposal\r\nthan hordes of half-armed peasants. Clearly then Galicia and Andalusia\r\nwere the dangerous points for the French, and the former more than the\r\nlatter, since an army descending from its hills, and falling on the\r\nlong line of communications between France and Madrid, might cause the\r\ngravest inconvenience. If there had been any organized Spanish forces\r\nin Aragon, there would have been an equal danger of an attack directed\r\nfrom Saragossa against the eastern flank of the French communications.\r\nBut while Galicia was possessed of a numerous army of regular troops,\r\nAragon had nothing to show but a mass of hastily assembled peasants,\r\nwho were not yet fully provided with arms and were only just beginning\r\nto be told off into battalions.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, at the moment when he began to order his troops to move, was\r\nunder the impression that he had to deal with a number of isolated\r\nriots rather than with a general insurrection of the Spanish nation.\r\nHis first orders show that he imagined that a few flying columns would\r\nbe able to scour the disaffected districts and scatter the bands of\r\ninsurgents without much trouble. Instead of a strategical plan for\r\nthe conquest of Spain, we find in his directions nothing more than\r\nprovisions for the launching of a small column against each point where\r\nhe had been informed that a rising had broken out. He presupposes that\r\nthe kingdom as a whole is quiet, and that bodies of 3,000 or 4,000\r\nmen may march anywhere, without having to provide for the maintenance\r\nof their communications with Madrid, or with each other. Only in a\r\nfriendly country would it have been possible to carry out such orders.\r\n\r\nThere were at the Emperor’s disposition, at the end of May, some\r\n116,000 men beyond the Pyrenees: but the 26,000 troops under Junot in\r\nPortugal were so completely cut off from the rest, by the insurrection\r\nin Castile and Estremadura, that they had to be left out of\r\nconsideration. Of the remainder the corps of Dupont and Moncey, 53,000\r\nstrong, lay in and about Madrid: Bessières, to whom the preservation\r\nof the main line of communications with France fell, had some 25,000\r\nbetween Burgos and San Sebastian: Duhesme, isolated at Barcelona, and\r\ncommunicating with France by Perpignan and not by Bayonne, had only\r\nsome 13,000 at his disposal in Catalonia. Up to the first week in June\r\nthe Emperor thought that the 91,000 men of these four corps would be\r\nenough to pacify Spain.\r\n\r\nHis first design was somewhat as follows: Bessières was to keep a firm\r\nhand on the line of communications, but also to detach a division of\r\n4,000 men under Lefebvre-Desnouettes against Saragossa, and a brigade\r\nunder Merle to pacify Santander and the northern littoral. The Emperor\r\ndoes not at first seem to have realized that, with the army of Galicia\r\nhanging on his western flank, Bessières might not be able to spare men\r\nfor such distant enterprises. He dealt with the corps as if it had\r\nnothing to face save the local insurgents of Aragon and Old Castile.\r\nFrom the large body of troops which lay about Madrid, Toledo, and\r\nAranjuez, two strong columns were to be dispatched to strike at the\r\ntwo main centres of the insurrection in Southern Spain. Dupont was to\r\ntake the first division of his army corps, with two brigades of cavalry\r\nand a few other troops, and march on Cordova and Seville. This gave\r\nhim no more than about 13,000 men for the subjugation of the large and\r\npopulous province of Andalusia. The other two infantry divisions of his\r\ncorps remained for the present near Madrid[100].\r\n\r\n  [100] For details of his force see the note on pp. 182-3.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the capital, Marshal Moncey with a somewhat\r\nsmaller force--one division of infantry from his own army corps and\r\none brigade of cavalry, 9,000 men in all--was to move on Valencia,\r\nand to take possession of that city and of the great naval arsenal of\r\nCartagena. His expedition was to be supported by a diversion from the\r\nside of Catalonia, for Duhesme (in spite of the small number of his\r\narmy) was told to send a column along the sea-coast route, by Tarragona\r\nand Tortosa, to threaten Valencia from the north. Moncey’s remaining\r\ninfantry divisions, which were not detailed for the expedition that\r\nhe was to lead, remained near Madrid, available (like Dupont’s second\r\nand third divisions) for the reinforcement of Bessières or the\r\nstrengthening of the two expeditionary columns, as circumstances might\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\nClearly Dupont and Moncey were both sent forth to undertake impossible\r\ntasks. Napoleon had not comprehended that it was not provincial\r\n_émeutes_ that he had to crush, but the regular resistance of a nation.\r\nTo send a column of 12,000 men on a march through 300 miles of hostile\r\nterritory to Cadiz, or a column of 9,000 men on a march of 180 miles\r\nto Valencia, presupposes the idea that the expeditions are affairs of\r\npolice and not strategical operations. Our astonishment grows greater\r\nwhen we consider the character of the troops which Dupont and Moncey\r\ncommanded. In the army of the former there was _one_ veteran French\r\nbattalion--that of the Marines of the Guard, six of raw recruits of the\r\nLegions of Reserve, two of Paris Municipal Guards (strangely distracted\r\nfrom their usual duties), one of the contingent of the Helvetic\r\nConfederation, and four of Swiss mercenaries in the Spanish service,\r\nwho had just been compelled to transfer their allegiance to Napoleon.\r\nThe cavalry consisted of four ‘provisional regiments’ of conscripts.\r\nIt was a military crime of the first order to send 13,000 troops of\r\nthis quality on an important expedition. Moncey’s force was of exactly\r\nthe same sort--eight battalions of conscripts formed in ‘provisional\r\nregiments’ and two ‘provisional regiments’ of dragoons, plus a\r\nWestphalian battalion, and two Spanish corps, who deserted _en masse_\r\nwhen they were informed that they were to march against Valencia in\r\ncompany with the marshal’s French troops. He had not one single company\r\nor squadron of men belonging to the old imperial army.\r\n\r\nBessières was much more fortunate, as, among the 25,000 men of whom he\r\ncould dispose, there were four veteran battalions of the line and two\r\nold regiments of cavalry; moreover there were sent ere long to his aid\r\nthree of the battalions of the Imperial Guard which lay at Madrid, and\r\nfour hundred sabres of the dragoons, chasseurs, and gendarmes of the\r\nsame famous corps.\r\n\r\nThe march of the two expeditionary columns began on May 24, a date\r\nat which Murat and his master had but the faintest notion of the\r\nwide-spreading revolt which was on foot. Moncey and Dupont were both\r\nofficers of distinction: the marshal was one of the oldest and the\r\nmost respected officers of the imperial army: he had won the grade\r\nof general of division in the days of the Republic, and did not owe\r\nhis first start in life to Napoleon. Of all the marshals he was by\r\nseveral years the senior. He passed as a steady, capable, and prudent\r\nofficer of vast experience. Dupont on the other hand was a young man,\r\nwho had first won a name by his brilliant courage at the combat of\r\nDirnstein in the Austrian war of 1805. Since then he had distinguished\r\nhimself at Friedland: he was on the way to rapid promotion, and, if\r\nhis expedition to Andalusia had succeeded, might have counted on a\r\nduchy and a marshal’s bâton as his reward. Napoleon knew him as a brave\r\nand loyal subordinate, but had never before given him an independent\r\ncommand. He could hardly guess that, when left to his own inspirations,\r\nsuch a brilliant officer would turn out to be dilatory, wanting in\r\ninitiative, and wholly destitute of moral courage. It is impossible to\r\njudge with infallible accuracy how a good lieutenant will behave, when\r\nfirst the load of responsibility is laid upon his shoulders. On May 24,\r\nDupont quitted Toledo with his 13,000 men: in the broad plains of La\r\nMancha he met with no opposition. Everywhere the people were sullen,\r\nbut no open hostility was shown. Even in the tremendous defiles of the\r\nSierra Morena he found no enemy, and crossed the great pass of Despeña\r\nPerros without having to fire a shot. Coming out at its southern end\r\nhe occupied Andujar, the town at the main junction of roads in Eastern\r\nAndalusia, on June 5. Here he got clear intelligence that the whole\r\ncountry-side was up in arms: Seville had risen on May 26, and the rest\r\nof the province had followed its example. There was a large assembly\r\nof armed peasants mustering at Cordova, but the regular troops had not\r\nyet been brought up to the front. General Castaños, whom the Junta had\r\nplaced in chief command, was still busily engaged in concentrating his\r\nscattered battalions, forming them into brigades and divisions, and\r\nhastily filling up with recruits the enormous gaps which existed in the\r\ngreater part of the corps. The regulars were being got together at a\r\ncamp at Carmona, south of the Guadalquivir, and not far from Seville.\r\nThe organization of new battalions, from the large number of volunteers\r\nwho remained when the old regiments were completed, took place\r\nelsewhere. It would be weeks, rather than days, before the unorganized\r\nmass took shape as an army, and Dupont might count on a considerable\r\nrespite before being attacked. But it was not only with the forces\r\nof Castaños that he had to reckon: at Cordova, Seville, Granada, and\r\nall the other towns of Andalusia, the peasants were flocking in to be\r\narmed and told off into new regiments. There was every probability\r\nthat in a few days the movement would spread northward over the Sierra\r\nMorena into La Mancha. An insurrection in this district would sever\r\nDupont’s communications with Madrid, for he had not left behind him any\r\nsufficient detachments to guard the defiles which he had just passed,\r\nor to keep open the great post-road to the capital across the plains of\r\nNew Castile. When he started he had been under the impression that it\r\nwas only local troubles in Andalusia that he had to suppress.\r\n\r\nDupont was already beginning to find that the insurgents were in much\r\ngreater numbers than he had expected when he crossed the Sierra Morena,\r\nbut till he had made trial of their strength he considered that it\r\nwould be wrong to halt. He had close before him the great city of\r\nCordova, a most tempting prize, and he resolved to push on at least so\r\nfar before taking it upon himself to halt and ask for reinforcements.\r\nHis continued movement soon brought about the first engagement of the\r\nwar, as at the bridge of Alcolea he found his advance disputed by a\r\nconsiderable hostile force [June 7].\r\n\r\nThe military commandant of the district of Cordova was a certain Don\r\nPedro de Echávarri, a retired colonel whom the local Junta had just\r\nplaced in command of its levies. His force consisted of 10,000 or\r\n12,000 peasants and citizens, who had only received their arms three\r\ndays before, and had not yet been completely told off into regiments\r\nand companies. On the 4th of June he had been sent a small body of\r\nold troops--one battalion of light infantry (Campo Mayor), and one\r\nof militia (the 3rd Provincial Grenadiers of Andalusia)--1,400 men\r\nin all, and with them eight guns. To have abandoned Cordova without\r\na fight would have discouraged the new levies, and probably have led\r\nto Echávarri’s own death; for the armed mob which he commanded would\r\nhave torn him to pieces as a traitor if he had refused to give battle.\r\nAccordingly he resolved to defend the passage of the Guadalquivir\r\nat the point where the high-road from Andujar crossed it, six miles\r\noutside Cordova. He barricaded the bridge and placed his guns and the\r\ntwo old battalions on the hither side of the river, in a position\r\ncommanding the defile. On each flank of them some thousands of the\r\nCordovan insurgents were drawn up, while the remainder of the levy,\r\nincluding all the mounted men, were sent across the bridge, and hidden\r\nin some hills which overhung the road by which the French were coming.\r\nThey were ordered to show themselves, and to threaten to fall upon the\r\nenemy from the flank, when he should have developed his attack upon\r\nthe bridge. If Echávarri had been guided by military considerations he\r\nwould not have dared to offer battle with such a raw and motley force\r\nto 12,000 French troops--even if the latter were but the conscripts of\r\nDupont. But political necessity compelled him to make the attempt.\r\n\r\nWhen Dupont found the position of Alcolea occupied, he cannonaded\r\nthe Spaniards for a time, and then launched his vanguard against the\r\nbridge. The leading battalion (it was one of those formed of the Paris\r\nMunicipal Guards) stormed the barricades with some loss, and began to\r\ncross the river. After it the rest of Pannetier’s brigade followed,\r\nand began to deploy for the attack on the Spanish position. At this\r\nmoment the Cordovan levies beyond the river showed themselves, and\r\nbegan to threaten a flank attack on Dupont. The latter sent his cavalry\r\nagainst them, and a few charges soon turned back the demonstration, and\r\nscattered the raw troops who had made it. Meanwhile Dupont’s infantry\r\nadvanced and overpowered the two regular battalions opposed to them:\r\nseeing the line broken, the masses of insurgents on the flanks left the\r\nfield without any serious fighting. The whole horde gave way and poured\r\nback into Cordova and right through the city, whose ruined walls they\r\nmade no attempt to defend. They had lost very few men, probably no more\r\nthan 200 in all, while the French had suffered even less, their only\r\ncasualties being thirty killed and eighty wounded, wellnigh all in the\r\nbattalion which had forced the barricades at the bridge.\r\n\r\nThere would be no reason to linger even for a moment over this\r\ninsignificant skirmish, if it had not been for the deplorable events\r\nwhich followed--events which did more to give a ferocious character\r\nto the war than any others, save perhaps the massacre by Calvo at\r\nValencia, which was taking place (as it chanced) on that very same day,\r\nJune 7.\r\n\r\nDupont, after giving his army a short rest, led it, still ranged in\r\nbattle array, across the six miles of plain which separated him from\r\nCordova. He expected to find the defeated army of Echávarri rallying\r\nitself within the city. But on arriving in front of its gates, he found\r\nthe walls unoccupied and the suburbs deserted. The Cordovans had\r\nclosed their gates, but it was rather for the purpose of gaining time\r\nfor a formal surrender than with any intention of resisting. Dupont\r\nhad already opened negotiations for the unbarring of the gates, when a\r\nfew scattered shots were fired at the French columns from a tower in\r\nthe wall, or a house abutting on it. Treating this as a good excuse\r\nfor avoiding the granting of a capitulation, Dupont blew open one of\r\nthe gates with cannon, and his troops rushed into the empty streets\r\nwithout finding any enemy to defeat. The impudent fiction of Thiers to\r\nthe effect that the entry of the French was seriously resisted, and\r\nthat desperate street-fighting took place, is sufficiently disproved\r\nby the fact that in the so-called storming of Cordova the French lost\r\naltogether two killed and seven wounded.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the city was sacked from cellar to garret. Dupont’s\r\nundisciplined conscripts broke their ranks and ran amuck through the\r\nstreets, firing into windows and battering down doors. Wherever there\r\nwas the least show of resistance they slew off whole households: but\r\nthey were rather intent on pillage and rape than on murder. Cordova was\r\na wealthy place, its shops were well worth plundering, its churches\r\nand monasteries full of silver plate and jewelled reliquaries, its\r\nvaults of the strong wines of Andalusia. All the scenes of horror that\r\nafterwards occurred at Badajoz or San Sebastian were rehearsed for the\r\nfirst time at Cordova; and the army of Dupont had far less excuse than\r\nthe English marauders and murderers of 1812 and 1813. The French had\r\ntaken the city practically without loss and without opposition, and\r\ncould not plead that they had been maddened by the fall of thousands of\r\ntheir comrades, or that they were drunk with the fury of battle after\r\nmany hours of desperate fighting at the breaches. Nevertheless, without\r\nany excuse of this sort, Dupont’s army behaved in a way that would have\r\nsuited better the hordes of Tilly and Wallenstein. Their commanders\r\ncould not draw them away from their orgies and outrages till the next\r\nday: indeed, it seems that many of the French officers disgraced\r\nthemselves by joining in the plunder. While the men were filling their\r\nhaversacks with private property, there were found colonels and even\r\ngenerals who were not ashamed to load carts and coaches with pictures,\r\ntapestries, and metal-work from churches and public buildings, and bags\r\nof dollars from the treasury, where no less than 10,000,000 reals of\r\nspecie had been found. Laplanne, whom Dupont appointed commandant of\r\nthe place, took 2,000 ducats of blackmail from the Count of Villanueva,\r\non whom he had billeted himself, in return for preserving his mansion\r\nfrom pillage. When the French left Cordova, nine days later, they had\r\nwith them more than 500 wheeled vehicles seized in the place which were\r\nloaded with all sorts of plunder[101].\r\n\r\n  [101] It is astonishing to find that Napier (i. 114) expressly\r\n  denies that Cordova was sacked. Foy (iii. 231), the best of the\r\n  French historians, acknowledges that ‘unarmed civilians were\r\n  shot, churches and houses sacked, and scenes of horror enacted\r\n  such as had not been seen since the Christian drove out the\r\n  Moor in 1236.’ Captain Baste, the best narrator among French\r\n  eye-witnesses, speaks of assassination, general pillage, and\r\n  systematic rape. Cabany, Dupont’s laudatory biographer, confesses\r\n  (p. 89) to drunkenness and deplorable excesses, and allows that\r\n  Dupont distributed 300,000 francs as a ‘gratification’ among his\r\n  general officers. Many of the details given above are derived\r\n  from the official narrative of the Cordovan municipal authorities\r\n  printed in the _Madrid Gazette_.\r\n\r\nDupont had hardly settled down in Cordova, and begun to substitute\r\ncrushing military contributions for unsystematic pillage, when he found\r\nhimself cut off from his base. The valley of the Upper Guadalquivir,\r\nand the slopes of the Sierra Morena, on both the southern and the\r\nnorthern sides of the passes, rose in arms in the second week of\r\nJune. The French had left no detachments behind to preserve their\r\ncommunications: between Cordova and Toledo there were only a few posts\r\nwhere stragglers and sick had been collected, some isolated officers\r\nbusy on surveying or on raising contributions, and some bodies of ten\r\nor twenty men escorting couriers or belated trains of wagons bearing\r\nfood or ammunition to the front. Most of these unfortunate people were\r\ncut up by the insurgents, who displayed from the first a most ferocious\r\nspirit. The news of the sack of Cordova drove them to the commission\r\nof inhuman cruelties; some prisoners were blinded, others tortured\r\nto death: Foy says that the brigadier-general Réné, surprised while\r\ncrossing the Morena, was thrown into a vat of boiling water and scalded\r\nto death[102]. The parties, which escaped massacre hastily drew back\r\ntowards Madrid and Toledo, and soon there was not a French soldier\r\nwithin 150 miles of Dupont’s isolated division.\r\n\r\nThat general did not at first realize the unpleasantness of his\r\nposition. He had been sufficiently surprised by the opposition offered\r\nat Alcolea, and the rumours of the concentration of the army of\r\nCastaños, to make him unwilling to advance beyond Cordova. He wrote\r\nto Murat asking for reinforcements, and especially for troops to keep\r\nopen his lines of communication. There were, he said, at least 25,000\r\nregular troops marching against him: the English might disembark\r\nreinforcements at Cadiz: the whole province was in a flame: it was\r\nimpossible to carry out the Grand-Duke of Berg’s original orders to\r\npush straight on to Seville. But matters were even worse than he\r\nthought: in a few days he realized, from the non-arrival of couriers\r\nfrom Madrid, that he was cut off: moreover, his foraging parties, even\r\nwhen they were only a few miles outside Cordova, began to be molested\r\nand sometimes destroyed.\r\n\r\n  [102] Foy, iii. 233. Cabany (p. 96), on the other hand, says that\r\n  he was sawn in two between planks. Gille, in his _Mémoires d’un\r\n  Conscrit de 1808_ (p. 85), gives other distressing details.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting nine days, Dupont very wisely resolved to fall back, and\r\nto endeavour to reopen communications with his base. On June 16 he\r\nevacuated Cordova, much to the regret of his soldiers, who resented the\r\norder to abandon such comfortable quarters. On the nineteenth, dragging\r\nwith him an enormous convoy of plunder, he reached Andujar, the great\r\njunction of roads where the routes from the passes of the Morena come\r\ndown to the valley of the Guadalquivir. It would have been far wiser\r\nto go still further back, and to occupy the debouches of the defiles,\r\ninstead of lingering in the plain of Andalusia. He should have retired\r\nto Baylen, the town at the foot of the mountains, or to La Carolina,\r\nthe fortress in the upland which commands the southern exit of the\r\nDespeña Perros. But he was vainly dreaming of resuming the attempt to\r\nconquer the whole south of Spain when reinforcements should arrive, and\r\nAndujar tempted him, since it was the best point from which he could\r\nthreaten at once Cordova, Jaen, and Granada, the three chief towns of\r\nEastern Andalusia. Here, therefore, he abode from June 19 to July 18, a\r\nwasted month during which the whole situation of affairs in Spain was\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nHere we must leave Dupont, while we treat of the doings of the other\r\nFrench generals during the month of June. While the invasion of\r\nAndalusia was running its course, both Moncey and Bessières had been\r\nseriously engaged.\r\n\r\nThe first named of the two marshals was placed in charge of one-half of\r\nthe offensive part of Napoleon’s plan for the subjugation of Spain,\r\nwhile Bessières was mainly responsible for the defensive part, i.e.\r\nfor the maintaining of the communications between Madrid and Bayonne.\r\nIt is with Moncey’s expedition against Valencia, therefore, that we\r\nmust first deal. Although he started a few days later than Dupont,\r\nthat marshal was (like his colleague) still dominated by the idea that\r\npossessed both Napoleon and Murat--that the insurrections were purely\r\nlocal, and that their suppression was a mere measure of police. This\r\nnotion accounts for his choice of route: there are two roads from\r\nMadrid to Valencia, a long and fairly easy one which passes through\r\nthe gap between the mountains of Murcia and those of Cuenca, by San\r\nClemente, Chinchilla, and the plain of Almanza, and a shorter one,\r\nfull of dangerous defiles and gorges, which cuts through the heart\r\nof the hills by Tarancon, Valverde, and Requeña. The former crosses\r\nthe watershed between the valley of the Tagus and those of the rivers\r\nflowing into the Mediterranean Sea at the easiest point, the latter at\r\none of the most difficult ones. But Moncey, thinking only of the need\r\nto deal promptly with the Valencian insurgents, chose the shorter and\r\nmore difficult route.\r\n\r\nHe left Madrid on June 4: a week later he was near Cuenca, in the\r\nmidst of the mountains. Not a shot had yet been fired at him, but as\r\nhe pressed eastward he found the villages more and more deserted, till\r\nat last he had reached a region that seemed to have become suddenly\r\ndepopulated. He turned a little out of his way on the eleventh to\r\noccupy the city of Cuenca[103], the capital of this wild and rugged\r\ncountry, but resumed his advance on the eighteenth, after receiving\r\nfrom Madrid peremptory orders to press forward[104]. There lay before\r\nhim two tremendous defiles, which must be passed if he was to reach\r\nValencia. The first was the deep-sunk gorge of the river Cabriel, where\r\nthe highway plunges down a cliff, crosses a ravine, and climbs again\r\nup a steep opposing bank. The second, thirty miles further on, was the\r\nPass of the Cabrillas, the point where the road, on reaching the edge\r\nof the central plateau of Spain, suddenly sinks down into the low-lying\r\nfertile plain of Valencia.\r\n\r\n  [103] Cuenca lies twenty-five miles off the main Madrid-Valencia\r\n  road, well to the north of it.\r\n\r\n  [104] Moncey’s delay of a week at Cuenca provoked Savary (now\r\n  acting for the invalided Murat) to such an extent, that he sent\r\n  forward the cavalry-general Excelmans, nominally to take charge\r\n  of Moncey’s vanguard, really to spur the cautious marshal on to\r\n  action. But Excelmans was captured on the way by peasants, and\r\n  sent a prisoner to Valencia.\r\n\r\nIf the Conde de Cervellon, the general whom the Valencian Junta had put\r\nin charge of its army, had concentrated on these defiles the 7,000 or\r\n8,000 regular troops who were to be found in the province and in the\r\nneighbouring district of Murcia, it is probable that Moncey would never\r\nhave forced his way through the mountains; for each of the positions,\r\nif held in sufficient force, is practically impregnable. But the\r\nSpaniards had formed a deeply rooted notion that the invader would come\r\nby the easy road over the plains, by San Clemente and Almanza, and not\r\nthrough the mountains of Cuenca. The whole of the troops of Murcia and\r\nthe greater part of those of Valencia had been directed on Almanza,\r\nwhere there was a good position for opposing an army descending from\r\nCastile. Only a small detachment had been sent to watch the northern\r\nroad, and its commander, Don Pedro Adorno, had stationed at the bridge\r\nof the Cabriel no more than one battalion of Swiss mercenaries (No.\r\n1 of Traxler’s regiment) and 500 armed peasants with four guns. The\r\nposition was too extensive to be held by 1,500 men: Moncey found that\r\nthe river was fordable in several places, and detached a small column\r\nto cross at each, while two battalions dashed at the bridge. In spite\r\nof the steepness of the ravine the French got over at more than one\r\npoint, and climbed the opposite slope, whereupon the peasants fled,\r\nand half the Swiss battalion was surrounded and captured while it was\r\ntrying to cover the retreat of the guns[105]. Adorno, who was lying\r\nsome miles to the rear, at Requeña, when he should have been present\r\nin full force at the bridge, ought now to have fallen back to cover\r\nValencia, but in a moment of panic he fled across country to join the\r\narmy at Almanza [June 21].\r\n\r\n  [105] Moncey induced a good many of these mercenaries to take\r\n  service with him; but they deserted him when the time of trouble\r\n  began.\r\n\r\nThis disgraceful flight left the Valencian Junta almost destitute of\r\ntroops for the defence of the still stronger defile of the Cabrillas,\r\nwhich Moncey had yet to force before he could descend into the plain.\r\nThe Junta hurried up to it two regiments of recruits--one of which is\r\nsaid to have been first practised in the manual exercise the day before\r\nit went into action[106]. These, with 300 old soldiers, the wrecks of\r\nthe combat at the Cabriel, and three guns, tried to hold the pass.\r\nMoncey turned both flanks of this very inadequate defending force, and\r\nthen broke through its centre. Many of the Spaniards dispersed, 500\r\nwere slain or captured, and the rest fled down the pass to Valencia.\r\nAfter riding round the position, Moncey remarked that it was so strong\r\nthat with 6,000 steady troops he would undertake to hold it against\r\nNapoleon himself and the Grand Army [June 24].\r\n\r\n  [106] Arteche, _Guerra de la Independencia_, ii. 150.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, after a rapid march down the defile and across the\r\nfertile Valencian plain, Moncey presented himself before the gates of\r\nits capital, and demanded its surrender. But he found that there was\r\nstill much fighting to be done: a small column of regulars had arrived\r\nin the city, though the main army from Almanza was still far distant.\r\nWith three battalions of old troops and 7,000 Valencian levies, Don\r\nJosé Caro, a naval officer and brother of the celebrated Marquis of\r\nLa Romana, had taken up a position four miles outside the city at San\r\nOnofre. He had covered his front with some irrigation canals, and\r\nbarricaded the road. Moncey had to spend the twenty-seventh in beating\r\nback this force into Valencia, not without some sharp fighting.\r\n\r\nOn the next day he made a general assault upon the city. Valencia was\r\nnot a modern fortress: it had merely a wet ditch and an enceinte of\r\nmediaeval walls. There were several points where it seemed possible\r\nto escalade the defences, and the marshal resolved to storm the\r\nplace. But he had forgotten that he had to reckon with the auxiliary\r\nfortifications which the populace had constructed during the last\r\nthree days. They had built up the gates with beams and earth,\r\nbarricaded the streets, mounted cannon on the walls where it was\r\npossible, and established several batteries of heavy guns to sweep the\r\nmain approaches from the open country. The city being situated in a\r\nperfectly level plain, and in ground much cut up by irrigation canals,\r\nit had been found possible to inundate much of the low ground. As the\r\nriver Guadalaviar washed the whole northern side of the walls, Moncey’s\r\npracticable points of attack were restricted to certain short spaces on\r\ntheir southern front.\r\n\r\nThe marshal first sent a Spanish renegade, a Colonel Solano, to summon\r\nthe place. But the Valencians were exasperated rather than cowed by\r\ntheir late defeats; their leaders--especially Padre Rico, a fighting\r\npriest of undoubted courage and capacity--had worked them up to a high\r\npitch of enthusiasm, and they must have remembered that, if they\r\nsubmitted, they would have to render an account for Calvo’s abominable\r\nmassacre of the French residents. Accordingly the Junta returned\r\nthe stirring answer that ‘the people of Valencia preferred to die\r\ndefending itself rather than to open any sort of negotiations.’ A mixed\r\nmultitude of 20,000 men, of whom some 8,000 were troops of one sort\r\nand another[107], manned the walls and barricades and waited for the\r\nassault.\r\n\r\n  [107] But only 1,500 were regulars; the rest were newly\r\n  incorporated levies.\r\n\r\nAfter riding round the exposed front of the city, Moncey resolved to\r\nattack only the south-eastern section. He formed two columns, each of\r\na brigade, of which one assailed the gate of San José near the river,\r\nwhile another marched on the gate of Quarte, further to the south.\r\nConsidering the weak resistance that he had met at the Cabriel and at\r\nthe Pass of the Cabrillas, he had formed a sanguine expectation that\r\nthe Valencians would not make a firm stand, even behind walls and\r\nbarricades. In this he was wofully deceived: the French had yet to\r\nlearn that the enemy, though helpless in the open, was capable of the\r\nmost obstinate resistance when once he had put himself under cover of\r\nbricks and earth. The first assault was beaten off with heavy loss,\r\nthough Moncey’s conscripts showed great dash, reached the foot of the\r\ndefences, and tried to tear down the palisades with their hands. The\r\nmarshal should have seen at once that he had too large a business in\r\nhand for the 8,000 men of whom he could dispose. But he persevered,\r\nbringing forward his field artillery to batter the gates and earthworks\r\nbefore a second assault should be made. It was to no purpose, as they\r\nwere soon silenced by the guns of position which the besieged had\r\nprepared for this very purpose. Late in the afternoon Moncey risked a\r\nsecond general attack, embracing the gate of Santa Lucia as well as the\r\nother points which he had before assailed. But the stormers were beaten\r\noff with even heavier loss than on the first assault, and bodies of\r\nthe defenders, slipping out by posterns and side-gates, harassed the\r\nretreating columns by a terrible flanking fire.\r\n\r\nClearly the game was up: Moncey had lost at least 1,200 men, a sixth of\r\nhis available infantry force[108]. He was much to blame for pressing\r\nthe attack when his first movement failed, for as Napoleon (wise after\r\nthe event) said in his commentary on the marshal’s operations: ‘On ne\r\nprend pas par le collet une ville de quatre-vingt mille âmes.’ If the\r\nfirst charge did not carry the walls, and the garrison stood firm, the\r\nFrench could only get in by the use of siege artillery, of which they\r\ndid not possess a single piece.\r\n\r\n  [108] Foy, generally a very fair calculator of French casualties,\r\n  gives the marshal’s losses at 2,000 men in all, which seems\r\n  rather a high figure. Napier (i. 95) says that he had 800 wounded\r\n  to carry, which supposes a total loss of 1,100 or 1,200. Thiers’\r\n  estimate of 300 is as obviously absurd as most of the other\r\n  figures given by that historian. No such loss would have stopped\r\n  a French army--even an army of conscripts.\r\n\r\nMoncey’s position was now very dangerous: he knew that the country was\r\nup in arms behind him, and that his communications with Madrid were\r\ncompletely cut. He was also aware that Cervellon’s army from Almanza\r\nmust be marching towards him, unless it had taken the alternative\r\ncourse of pressing in on his rear, to occupy the difficult passes by\r\nwhich he had come down into the Valencian coast-plain. His conscripts\r\nwere dreadfully discouraged by their unexpected reverse: he was\r\nhampered by a great convoy of wounded men, whose transport would cause\r\nserious delays. Nothing had been heard of the diversion which General\r\nChabran, with troops detached from Duhesme’s army in Catalonia, had\r\nbeen ordered to execute towards the northern side of Valencia. As a\r\nmatter of fact that general had not even crossed the Ebro. Retreat was\r\nnecessary: of the three possible lines on which it could be executed,\r\nthat along the coast road, in the direction where Chabran was to be\r\nexpected, was thought of for a moment, but soon abandoned: it was too\r\nlong, and the real base of the marshal’s corps was evidently Madrid,\r\nand not Barcelona. The route by Tarancon and the Cabrillas, by which\r\nthe army had reached Valencia, was terribly difficult: clearly it would\r\nbe necessary to force again the defiles which had been cleared on the\r\nway down to the coast. And it was possible that 9,000 or 10,000 regular\r\ntroops might now be occupying them.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Moncey resolved to retire by the third road, that\r\nthrough the plains by Almanza and San Clemente. If, as was possible,\r\nCervellon’s whole army was now blocking it, they must be fought and\r\ndriven off: a battle in the plain would be less dangerous than a battle\r\nat the Cabrillas or the bridge of the Cabriel. Before daylight on June\r\n29, therefore, the marshal moved off on this road.\r\n\r\nLuck now came to his aid: the incapable Spanish commander had made up\r\nhis mind that the French would retreat by the way that they had come,\r\nand had sent forward General Llamas with all the troops of Murcia\r\nto seize the defile of the Cabrillas. He himself followed with the\r\nrest of the regulars, but halted at Alcira, behind the Xucar. Thus\r\nwhile Moncey was marching to the south, the main body of his enemies\r\nwas moving northward. Cervellon refused to fight in the absence of\r\nLlamas, so nothing was left in the marshal’s way save bands of peasants\r\nwho occupied the fords of the Xucar and the road between Jativa and\r\nAlmanza: these he easily brushed away in a couple of skirmishes. Nor\r\ndid a small column detached in pursuit from Valencia dare to meddle\r\nseriously with his rearguard. So without even exchanging a shot with\r\nthe Spanish field-army, which Cervellon had so unwisely scattered and\r\nsent off on a false track, Moncey was able to make his way by Jativa,\r\nAlmanza, and Chinchilla back towards La Mancha [July 2-6].\r\n\r\nAt San Clemente he met with reinforcements under General Frère,\r\nconsisting of the third division of Dupont’s original corps, some\r\n5,000 strong. This division had been sent to search for him by Savary,\r\nwho had been filled with fears for his safety when he found that the\r\ncommunications were cut, and that Cuenca and all the hill-country had\r\nrisen behind the expeditionary force. After vainly searching for Moncey\r\non the northern road, in the direction of Requeña, Frère at last got\r\nnews that he had taken the southern line of retreat, and successfully\r\njoined him on July 8. At San Clemente the marshal intended to halt\r\nand to wait for Cervellon’s arrival, in the hope of beating him in\r\nthe open. But a few days later he received news from Madrid, to the\r\neffect that Savary wished to draw back the French forces nearer to the\r\ncapital, and that Frère, at least, must move in to Ocaña or Toledo.\r\nMuch displeased at finding a junior officer acting as the lieutenant of\r\nthe Emperor--for Savary was but a lieutenant-general, while he himself\r\nwas a marshal--Moncey threw up the whole scheme of waiting to fight\r\nthe Valencian army, and marched back to the immediate neighbourhood of\r\nMadrid [July 15].\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the marshal had extraordinary luck in this\r\nshort campaign. If he had been opposed by a general less timid and\r\nincapable than the Conde de Cervellon, he might have found arrayed\r\nagainst him, at the bridge of the Cabriel, or at the Cabrillas, a\r\nconsiderable body of regulars--eight or nine thousand men--with a\r\nnumerous artillery, instead of the insignificant forces which he\r\nactually defeated. Again, while he was trying to storm Valencia,\r\nCervellon might have attacked him in the rear with great chance of\r\nsuccess; or the Spaniard might have kept his forces united, and opposed\r\nMoncey as he retreated from before Valencia. Instead of doing so he\r\nsplit up his army into detachments, and the greater part of it was sent\r\noff far from the central point of his operations, and did not fire\r\na shot. Truly such a general was, as Thucydides remarks concerning\r\nthe Spartans of old, ‘very convenient for his adversaries.’ A less\r\nconsiderate enemy would have had a fair chance of bringing Moncey’s\r\ncampaign to the same disastrous end that befell that of Dupont.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS IN THE NORTH: THE SIEGE OF SARAGOSSA\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving watched the failure of the expeditions by which Napoleon had\r\nhoped to complete the conquest of Southern Spain, we must turn our eyes\r\nnorthward, to Madrid and the long line of communications which joined\r\nthe capital to the French base of operations at Vittoria, Pampeluna,\r\nand San Sebastian. At the moment when the Valencian and Andalusian\r\nexpeditions were sent out from Madrid and Toledo, Murat had still\r\nunder his hand a large body of troops, the second and third division\r\nof Moncey’s corps, the second and third of Dupont’s, and the 5,000\r\nhorse and foot of the Imperial Guard--in all more than 30,000 men.\r\nBessières, if the garrison of the northern fortresses and some newly\r\narrived reinforcements are added to his original force, had more than\r\n25,000. With these the grand-duke and the marshal had to contain the\r\ninsurrection in Northern Spain, and to beat back the advance of the\r\narmy of Galicia.\r\n\r\nThe furthest points to the north and east to which the wave of\r\ninsurrection had washed up were Logroño and Tudela in the Ebro\r\nvalley, Santander on the coast of the Bay of Biscay, and Palencia and\r\nValladolid in Old Castile. All these places lay in Bessières’ sphere of\r\naction, and he promptly took measures to suppress the rising at each\r\npoint. On June 2 a column sent out from Vittoria reoccupied Logroño,\r\nslaying some hundreds of half-armed peasants, and executing some of\r\ntheir leaders who had been taken prisoners. On the same day a stronger\r\nforce, six battalions and two squadrons under General Merle, marched\r\nfrom Burgos on Santander. Driving before him the insurgents of the\r\nUpper Ebro valley, Merle advanced as far as Reynosa, and was about\r\nto force the defiles of the Cantabrian Mountains and to descend on\r\nto Santander, when he received orders to return and to take part in\r\nsuppressing the more dangerous rising in the plains of Old Castile.\r\nNews had arrived that the captain-general, Cuesta, was collecting a\r\nforce at Valladolid, which threatened to cut the road between Burgos\r\nand Madrid. To deal with him Bessières told off Merle, and another\r\nsmall column of four battalions and two regiments of _chasseurs_ under\r\nhis brilliant cavalry-brigadier, Lasalle, one of the best of Napoleon’s\r\nyounger generals. After sacking Torquemada (where some peasants\r\nattempted an ineffectual resistance) and ransoming the rich cathedral\r\ntown of Palencia, Lasalle got in touch with the forces of Cuesta at\r\nthe bridge of Cabezon, where the main road from Burgos to Valladolid\r\ncrosses the river Pisuerga. On the eleventh of June Merle joined him:\r\non the twelfth their united forces, 9,000 strong, fell upon the levies\r\nof the Captain-general.\r\n\r\nThroughout the two years during which he held high command in the\r\nfield, Gregorio de la Cuesta consistently displayed an arrogance\r\nand an incapacity far exceeding that of any other Spanish general.\r\nConsidering the state of his embryo ‘army of Castile,’ it was insane\r\nfor him to think of offering battle. He had but four cannon; his only\r\nveteran troops were 300 cavalry, mainly consisting of the squadrons\r\nwhich had accompanied Ferdinand VII as escort on his unhappy journey\r\nto Bayonne. His infantry was composed of 4,000 or 5,000 volunteers of\r\nthe Valladolid district, who had not been more than a fortnight under\r\narms, and had seen little drill and still less musketry practice. It\r\nwas absolutely wicked to take them into action. But the men, in their\r\nignorance, clamoured for a battle, and Cuesta did not refuse it to\r\nthem. His dispositions were simply astounding; instead of barricading\r\nor destroying the bridge and occupying the further bank, he led his\r\nunhappy horde across the river and drew them up in a single line, with\r\nthe bridge at their backs.\r\n\r\nOn June 12 Lasalle came rushing down upon the ‘army of Castile,’ and\r\ndashed it into atoms at the first shock. The Spanish cavalry fled\r\n(as they generally did throughout the war), the infantry broke, the\r\nbridge and the guns were captured. Some hundreds of the unfortunate\r\nrecruits were sabred, others were drowned in the river. Cuesta fled\r\nwestwards with the survivors to Medina de Rio Seco, abandoning to its\r\nfate Valladolid, which Lasalle occupied without opposition on the same\r\nevening. The combat by which this important city was won had cost the\r\nFrench only twelve killed and thirty wounded.\r\n\r\nThis stroke had completely cleared Bessières’ right flank: there\r\ncould be no more danger from the north-west till the army of Galicia\r\nshould think proper to descend from its mountains to contest with\r\nthe French the dominion of the plains of Leon and Old Castile. The\r\nmarshal could now turn his attention to other fronts of his extensive\r\nsphere of command. After the fight of Cabezon Merle’s division was\r\nsent northward, to conquer the rugged coastland of the province of\r\nSantander. There were frightful defiles between Reynosa and the shore\r\nof the Bay of Biscay: the peasants had blocked the road and covered\r\nthe hillsides with _sungahs_. But the defence was feeble--as might be\r\nexpected from the fact that the district could only put into the field\r\none battalion of militia[109] and a crowd of recent levies, who had\r\nbeen about three weeks under arms. On June 23 Merle finished clearing\r\nthe defiles and entered Santander, whose bishop and Junta fled, with\r\nthe wreck of their armed force, into the Asturias.\r\n\r\n  [109] ‘Provincial of Laredo,’ 571 bayonets.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the troops under Bessières had been equally active, but with\r\nvery different results, on the Middle Ebro and in the direction of\r\nAragon. It was known at Burgos and at Bayonne that Saragossa had risen\r\nlike the rest of the Spanish cities. But it was also known that there\r\nwas hardly a man of regular troops in the whole kingdom of Aragon:\r\nhere, as in Old Castile or in Santander, the invaders would have to\r\ndeal only with raw levies, who would probably disperse after their\r\nfirst defeat. Saragossa itself, the central focus of the rising, was no\r\nmodern fortress, but a town of 60,000 souls, surrounded by a mediaeval\r\nwall more fitted to assist in the levy of _octroi_ duties, than in a\r\ndefence against a regular army. Accordingly the column under Lefebvre\r\nDesnouettes, which was directed to start from Pampeluna against the\r\nAragonese insurgents, was one of very moderate size--3,500 infantry,\r\n1,000 horse, and a single battery of field artillery[110]. But it was\r\nto be joined a few days later by another brigade[111] and battery,\r\nwhich would bring its total force up to something more than 6,000 men.\r\n\r\n  [110] They were a battalion each of the 15th, 47th, and 70th of\r\n  the line, all old troops, and the 2nd ‘Supplementary Regiment of\r\n  the legions of Reserve,’ two battalions strong, with a regiment\r\n  of Polish lancers and the 5th _escadron de marche_.\r\n\r\n  [111] The 1st regiment of the Vistula (two batts.) and the 6th\r\n  _bataillon de marche_.\r\n\r\nThe resources of the kingdom of Aragon were large, but the patriots\r\nwere, when the war broke out, in a condition most unfavourable for\r\nstrenuous action. The province was one of those which had been denuded\r\nof its usual garrison: there only remained part of a cavalry regiment,\r\nthe ‘King’s Dragoons,’ whose squadrons had been so depleted that it had\r\nonly 300 men and ninety horses, with a weak battalion of Volunteers of\r\nAragon--some 450 men--and 200 gunners and sappers. In addition there\r\nhad straggled into Saragossa about 500 men from various Spanish corps\r\nat Madrid, Burgos, and elsewhere, who had deserted their colours when\r\nthe news of the insurrection reached them. This was a small _cadre_\r\non which to create a whole army, but the feat was accomplished by the\r\nenergetic young man who put himself at the head of the rising in the\r\nmiddle valley of the Ebro. Joseph Palafox, the second son of a noble\r\nfamily of Aragon, had been one of the suite which accompanied Ferdinand\r\nVII to Bayonne, and was an indignant spectator of the abominable\r\ntreachery which there took place. When the tragedy was over he was\r\nfortunate enough to escape to Spain: he retired to his native district,\r\ntook a prominent part in rousing the Aragonese, and was chosen by\r\nthem as Captain-general when the weak or incapable Guillelmi was\r\ndeposed. He was only twenty-eight years of age, and had no military\r\nexperience, for he had only served in the peaceful ranks of the king’s\r\nbodyguard[112]. He had been a courtier rather than a soldier, yet at\r\nthe critical moment of his life it cannot be denied that he displayed\r\na courage and energy which justified the high opinions which the\r\nAragonese entertained of him. He kept Saragossa clean from the plague\r\nof political assassination, which was so rife in every other corner of\r\nSpain. He wisely got his appointment as Captain-general confirmed by\r\nthe Cortes of Aragon, which he summoned to meet in its ancient form. He\r\nfound out the most capable leaders of the populace, and always asked\r\ntheir advice before taking any important step. But his main virtue was\r\nhis untiring activity: considering the procrastination and want of\r\norganizing power displayed by most of the Spanish generals, his talent\r\nfor rapid work seems remarkable. He was only placed in power on May 26,\r\nand by June 8 he was already engaged with the French. In this short\r\ntime he had raised and organized seven regiments of new levies--7,400\r\nmen in all. They were stiffened with the deserters from Madrid, and\r\ncommanded by such retired and half-pay officers as could be got\r\ntogether. There were some scores of cannon in the arsenal of Saragossa,\r\nbut hardly any gunners, and a very small store of ammunition. Palafox\r\nstarted a powder factory and a manufactory of small arms, turned the\r\nworkmen of the Canal of Aragon into a corps of sappers, and made a\r\ngeneral levy of horses to remount his single regiment of dragoons,\r\nand to provide his artillery with draught animals. This was but the\r\ncommencement of Palafox’s activity: ere Saragossa was saved he had\r\nraised the whole kingdom, and got more than 30,000 men under arms[113].\r\n\r\n  [112] Palafox has been so often abused that I take the\r\n  opportunity of quoting the description of him given by Sir\r\n  Charles Vaughan, one of the three or four Englishmen who saw\r\n  him at Saragossa in the day of his power, and the only one who\r\n  has left his impressions on record. He lived with Palafox for\r\n  some five weeks in October-November, 1808. ‘This distinguished\r\n  nobleman is about thirty-four years of age [an overstatement by\r\n  six years]; his person is of middling stature, his eyes lively\r\n  and expressive, and his whole deportment that of a perfectly\r\n  well-bred man. In private life, so far as my daily intercourse\r\n  gave me an opportunity of judging, his manners were kind,\r\n  unaffected, and ingratiating. From the great readiness with\r\n  which he dispatched business, and from the letters and public\r\n  papers which were written by him with apparent great ease in my\r\n  presence, I was led to form a very favourable opinion of his\r\n  talents. There was a quickness in his manner of seizing objects,\r\n  an impatience until they were accomplished. He was fond of\r\n  talking of the events of the siege, and anxious to introduce to\r\n  us men of every class who had distinguished themselves. There\r\n  was a vivacity in his manner and conversation, an activity in\r\n  his exertions as an officer, that is rarely met in a Spaniard.\r\n  It was always a most cheering and interesting thing to ride with\r\n  him through the streets of Saragossa. The joy and exultation of\r\n  the people as he passed evidently sprung from the heart. To have\r\n  acquitted himself to their satisfaction was no mean reward, and\r\n  forms a sufficient answer to all the unworthy attempts (which\r\n  I have been disgusted to witness) to depreciate his character’\r\n  (_Vaughan Papers_, from an unpublished journal of 1808).\r\n\r\n  [113] Napier is always hard on Spanish officers and\r\n  administrators, but I think that of the whole class Palafox\r\n  receives the most undeserved contumely from his pen. He holds him\r\n  to have been a mere puppet, whose strings were pulled by obscure\r\n  Saragossan demagogues like the celebrated Tio Jorge. He even\r\n  doubts his personal courage. Both Spanish and French historians\r\n  unite in taking the Captain-general quite seriously, and I think\r\n  they are right. His best testimonial is the harsh and vindictive\r\n  treatment that he received at Napoleon’s hands.\r\n\r\nAlready by the eighth of June he had hurried out a small force to\r\nmeet Lefebvre Desnouettes at Tudela, the frontier town on the Ebro,\r\nwhich in the Middle Ages had been known as ‘the key of Aragon.’ This\r\nforce, which consisted of 2,000 of his new levies, was placed under the\r\ncommand of his own elder brother the Marquis of Lazan, who had escaped\r\nfrom Madrid under the pretext that he would bring pressure to bear upon\r\nthe Captain-general and induce him to submit to Murat. The marquis,\r\nthough joined by 3,000 or 4,000 peasants and citizens of Tudela, was\r\neasily routed by the French column, and forced back to Mallen sixteen\r\nmiles nearer to Saragossa. Lefebvre followed him, after having executed\r\na certain number of the notables of Tudela and sacked the town.\r\nReinforced by more of his brother’s new levies, Lazan offered battle\r\nagain at Mallen, in a bad position, where his men had little protection\r\nagainst the enemy’s artillery and the charges of his Polish lancers. He\r\nwas naturally routed with severe losses. But even then the Aragonese\r\nwere not broken in spirit: Palafox himself marched out with the\r\nremainder of his new levies, some of whom had not been five days under\r\narms. At Alagon, only seventeen miles from the gates of Saragossa, he\r\ndrew up 6,000 infantry (of whom 500 were regulars) 150 dragoons and\r\nfour guns, trying to cover himself by the line of the Canal of Aragon\r\nand some olive groves. It is hardly necessary to say that his artillery\r\nwas overpowered by the fourteen pieces of the French, and that his\r\ninfantry gave back when furiously assailed by the Poles. Palafox\r\ncharged at the head of his two squadrons of dragoons, but was wounded\r\nin the arm and had his horse killed under him. His routed followers\r\ncarried him back into the city, where the majority took refuge, while\r\nthe more faint-hearted fled beyond it to Alcaniz and other points in\r\nUpper Aragon.\r\n\r\nElated by three easy victories, Lefebvre thought that there was nothing\r\nmore to do but to enter Saragossa in triumph. He was much deceived:\r\nthe citizens were standing at bay behind their flimsy defences, having\r\nrecovered in a single night from the dismay caused by the arrival of\r\nthe broken bands who had fought at Alagon. The military conditions\r\nwere not unlike those which Moncey had to face in another region,\r\na fortnight later: Saragossa like Valencia lies in an extensive\r\nplain, with its northern side washed by the waters of the Ebro, and\r\nits eastern by those of the shallow and fordable Huerba: but its\r\nsouthern and western fronts are exposed to attack from the open. It\r\nwas surrounded by a brick wall of ten to twelve feet high, interrupted\r\nin several places by convents and barracks whose blank back-faces\r\ncontinued the line of the _enceinte_[114]. Inside the wall were the\r\ncrowded lanes in which dwelt the 60,000 citizens, a tangle of narrow\r\nstreets save the one broad Coso which intersects the place from east\r\nto west. The houses were mostly solid and lofty structures of brick\r\nand stone, with the heavy barred windows and doors usual in Spain.\r\nThe strength, such as it was, of Saragossa consisted not in its outer\r\nshell, but in the closely packed houses, convents, and churches, each\r\nof which might serve at need as a small fortress. Many of them were\r\nsolid enough to resist any form of attack save that of being battered\r\nby artillery. When barricades had been thrown across the lanes from\r\nside to side, each square of buildings would need to be assaulted\r\nand captured piecemeal. But none of the French officers who arrived\r\nin front of Saragossa on June 15, 1808, had any conception that the\r\nproblem about to be presented to them was that of street-fighting\r\ncarried on from house to house. There had been many sieges since the\r\nwar of the French Revolution began, but none carried on in this manner.\r\nIn Italy or Germany no one had ever heard of a city which tried, for\r\nwant of bastions and curtains, to defend itself by barricades: such\r\nplaces always saved themselves by an obvious and blameless surrender.\r\n\r\n  [114] The chief of these buildings inserted in the wall were the\r\n  convents or Santa Engracia and the Misericordia, and the cavalry\r\n  barracks.\r\n\r\nBut if a siege was coming, there was one position just outside the town\r\nwhich was clearly destined to play a chief part in it. Just across the\r\nHuerba lay a broad flat-topped hill, the Monte Torrero, which rose to\r\nthe height of 180 feet, and overlooked all the south side of the place.\r\nIt was such a splendid vantage-ground for siege-batteries, that the\r\ndefenders were bound to hold it, lest it should fall into the power\r\nof the French. It should have been crowned by a strong detached fort,\r\nor even by an entrenched camp. But Palafox in the short time at his\r\ndisposal had only been able to throw up a couple of open batteries upon\r\nit, and to loophole the extensive magazines and workshops of the Canal\r\nof Aragon, which were scattered over the summit of the hill, while the\r\ncanal itself flowed, as a sort of outer defence, around its further\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nSaragossa had two other outlying defences: the one was the Aljafferia,\r\nan old square castle with four towers at its corners, which had been\r\nthe abode of Moorish emirs, and of Aragonese kings, but now served\r\nas the prison of the Inquisition. It lay a couple of hundred yards\r\noutside the western gate (Puerto del Portillo) of the city. It was a\r\nsolid brick structure, but quite unsuited to resist a serious artillery\r\nattack. The second outwork was the suburb of San Lazaro beyond the\r\nEbro: it was connected with Saragossa by a new and handsome bridge,\r\nknown as the ‘Puente de Piedra,’ or ‘Stone Bridge.’ Cannon were\r\nmounted at its southern end so as to sweep its whole length.\r\n\r\nOn June 15, Lefebvre-Desnouettes appeared before the city, driving\r\nbefore him some Spanish outposts which he had met upon the way. He\r\nresolved at once to carry the place by storm, a task which, considering\r\nthe weakness of its walls, did not seem impossible, and all the more\r\nso because the gates stood open, each defended only by an earthwork\r\ncontaining two or three guns. The French general, neglecting the Monte\r\nTorrero and its commanding slopes, attacked only the western front\r\nbetween the gate of Portillo, near the Ebro, and the gate of Santa\r\nEngracia, close to the banks of the Huerba. His French brigade assailed\r\nthe northern and his Polish regiment the southern half of this long\r\nline of walls and buildings. His two field-batteries were run up into\r\nthe fighting line, to batter the earthworks and to reply to the Spanish\r\nguns. The only reserve which he kept in hand consisted of his brigade\r\nof cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe resistance offered to Lefebvre was of the most irregular sort:\r\nPalafox himself was not present, and his second-in-command, Bustamante,\r\nseems to have done little in the way of issuing orders. The 6,000\r\nhalf-trained levies which had fought at Alagon had not recovered their\r\norganization, and were hopelessly mixed in the line of defence with\r\n4,000 or 5,000 armed citizens of all ages and classes who had gone to\r\nthe walls, each parish under the charge of two or three local leaders,\r\nwho paid little obedience to the commands of the regular officers.\r\n\r\nThe Captain-General himself had started out that morning at the head\r\nof 150 dragoons, and 200 infantry, all regulars, by the road beyond\r\nthe Ebro. He had told his subordinates that he was intending to raise\r\nin Upper Aragon a force with which he would fall on Lefebvre’s line\r\nof communications, and so compel him to abandon his attack on the\r\ncity. But there is no doubt that he had really conceived grave doubts\r\nas to the possibility of Saragossa defending itself, and intended to\r\navoid being captured within its walls. He wished to have the power of\r\ncontinuing the struggle outside, in case the French should penetrate\r\ninto the city. On the morning after the fight at Alagon, bruised and\r\nwounded, he was in a pessimistic frame of mind, as his resolve shows.\r\nBut there is no occasion to brand him, as does Napier, with timidity:\r\nhis previous and his subsequent conduct preclude such a charge. It was\r\nmerely an error of judgement: the Captain-General should have stayed\r\nbehind to defend his capital, and have sent his brother Lazan, or some\r\nother officer whom he could trust, to raise the country-side in the\r\nrear of the French[115]. His retirement might well have discouraged\r\nthe Saragossans and led to deplorable results; but as a matter of\r\nfact, Lefebvre’s attack began so soon after he had ridden out over the\r\nbridge, that the news of his departure had not yet got abroad, and the\r\npopulace were still under the impression that he was among them. It was\r\nnot till the fighting was over that he was missed.\r\n\r\n  [115] That Palafox and those about him despaired of the defence\r\n  is honestly confessed in the Marquis de Lazan’s _Campaña del\r\n  verano de 1808_. He and his brother ‘had not believed that an\r\n  open town defended by untrained peasants could defend itself,’\r\n  and the news of Lefebvre’s first repulse astonished as much as it\r\n  pleased them.\r\n\r\nLefebvre-Desnouettes before Saragossa was in exactly the same position\r\nas Moncey before Valencia, and acted in the same way, pushing forward\r\na rather reckless attack on the city in full confidence that the\r\nSpaniards would not stand before an assault pressed home. He had,\r\nmoreover, the advantages of being able to attack a wider front, of\r\nhaving no ditches and inundations to cramp his operations, and of\r\ndealing with walls even weaker than those of Valencia, and defended by\r\nartillery of which very few were pieces of heavy calibre.\r\n\r\nThe first attack was delivered in the most dashing, not to say\r\nfoolhardy, style. At the gate of Santa Engracia a squadron of Polish\r\nlancers, who led the van, charged into and over the small battery which\r\ncovered the ingress into the city. Their wild rush carried them right\r\ninto the place, in spite of a dropping fire of musketry directed upon\r\nthem from every house that they passed. Turning into a broad lane to\r\nthe left, these headstrong horsemen rode forward, losing men at every\r\nstep, till they were brought to a stand in the Plaza del Portillo,\r\nwhere the majority were shot down; a very few succeeded in escaping by\r\nthe way along which they had come. The Polish infantry, which should\r\nhave followed closely on the heels of the lancers, penetrated no\r\nfurther than the earthwork at the gate, where it got closely engaged\r\nwith the Spaniards who held the neighbouring convent of Santa Engracia.\r\nExposed in the open street to a heavy fire from behind walls and\r\nwindows, the leading battalion gave way, and retired into the olive\r\ngroves and buildings outside the gate.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the French brigade of Lefebvre’s division attacked the gates\r\nof Portillo and the Carmen and the adjoining cavalry barracks. At\r\nthe last-named post they scaled the walls, which were particularly\r\nlow and weak at this point, and got into the city. But at the gates\r\nthe batteries in the narrow ingress held them back. After a sharp\r\nskirmish, a general rush of peasants, soldiers, and citizens, swept\r\nout the invaders from the cavalry barracks, and the front of defence\r\nwas restored. Lefebvre would have done well to pause before renewing\r\nhis assault: but (like Moncey at Valencia) he was loth to believe that\r\nthe enemy would face a persistent attempt to break in. He accordingly\r\nordered both the columns to renew their attacks: for some time it\r\nseemed likely that he might succeed, for the French forced both the\r\nCarmen and the Portillo gates and reoccupied the cavalry barracks,\r\nwhile the Poles burst in for a second time at Santa Engracia. But it\r\nproved impossible to make any further advance into the city, where\r\nevery house was full of musketeers and the narrow lanes were blocked\r\nwith artillery, which swept them from end to end. When it became clear\r\nthat the enemy were making no further progress, the Spaniards rallied\r\nbehind the Bull-Ring on the Portillo front, and in the convent of Santa\r\nEngracia on the southern front, and swept out the decimated battalions\r\nof Lefebvre by a determined charge[116].\r\n\r\n  [116] The Spaniards have called this first attack on Saragossa\r\n  the action of the Eras del Rey, the name of the meadows outside\r\n  the Portillo and Carmen gates, in which the French columns massed\r\n  themselves for the attack.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising to find that the assailants had suffered very\r\nheavily in such a desperate attack on walls and barricades teeming with\r\ndefenders worked up to a high pitch of patriotic frenzy. Lefebvre lost\r\n700 men, and left behind him at the Portillo gate several guns which\r\nhad been brought up too close to the place, and could not be dragged\r\noff under the dreadful musketry fire from the walls, and the flanking\r\ndischarges from the neighbouring castle of Aljafferia. The Spaniards,\r\nfighting under cover except at the moment of their final charges, had\r\nsuffered comparatively little: their loss is estimated at not much over\r\n300 men. They might well be proud of their success: they had certainly\r\nshowed a heroic spirit in fighting so obstinately after three crushing\r\ndefeats in the open field. That a practically unfortified town should\r\ndefend itself by street-fighting was a new idea: and that peasants\r\nand citizens (there were not 900 regulars in the place) should not\r\nonly hold out behind walls, but execute desperate charges _en masse_,\r\nwould till that day have been regarded as impossible by any soldier\r\nof Napoleon. Every thinking man in the French army must have looked\r\nwith some dismay on the results of the fight, not because of the loss\r\nsuffered, for that was a mere trifle, but because of the prospect of\r\nthe desperate national resistance which had evidently to be faced.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Lefebvre-Desnouettes retired for some thousands of yards\r\nfrom the city, and pitched his camp facing its western front. He sent\r\npressing letters asking for reinforcements both to Madrid and to\r\nBayonne, and attempted no offensive action for ten days. If he sent\r\na formal summons of surrender to the Saragossans, it was to waste\r\ntime and allow fresh troops to arrive, rather than with any hope that\r\nhe could intimidate the citizens. He was himself more likely to be\r\nattacked during the next few days than to make any forward movement.\r\nBut he was already beginning to receive reinforcements: on June 21\r\nthere arrived two battalions of the 2nd Regiment of the Vistula, and\r\nmore troops were behind.\r\n\r\nPalafox, on the other hand, received much unexpected encouragement\r\nfrom the combat of the sixteenth. On receiving the news of it at\r\nBelchite on the following morning, he sent back his brother, the\r\nMarquis de Lazan, giving him the command of the city, and bidding him\r\ntell the Saragossans that he would endeavour to raise the siege in a\r\nvery few days. There was already a considerable body of insurgents\r\nin arms in South-western Aragon, under the Baron de Versage, who had\r\nraised at Calatayud two battalions of new levies[117], and gathered in\r\nsome fugitives from the Spanish garrison of Madrid. Palafox ordered\r\nthe baron to join him with every man that he could bring, and their\r\ntwo detachments met at Almunia on June 21, and from thence marched\r\ntowards Saragossa by the road which leads down the valley of the Xalon\r\nby Epila. At the last-named place they were only fifteen miles from\r\nLefebvre-Desnouettes’ camp, and were already threatening the French\r\ncommunications with Logroño and Vittoria. But their army was still very\r\nsmall--no more than 550 regular infantry, 1,000 men of Versage’s new\r\nregiments, 350 cavalry, and a couple of thousand levies of all kinds,\r\namong whom were noted a company of eighty armed Capuchin friars and a\r\nbody of mounted smugglers.\r\n\r\n  [117] He called them the ‘Regiment of Ferdinand VII,’ and the\r\n  ‘Second Regiment of the kingdom of Aragon.’\r\n\r\nThe French general had now to make up his mind whether he would raise\r\nthe siege and fall upon Palafox with his whole army, or whether he\r\nwould dare to divide his scanty resources, and maintain the attack on\r\nthe city with one part, while he sent a containing force against the\r\nCaptain-General’s bands. He resolved to take the latter course--a most\r\nhazardous one considering the fact that he had, even with his last\r\nreinforcements, not much more than 6,000 sound men in his camp. He\r\ndispatched the Polish Colonel Chlopiski with the first regiment of the\r\nVistula, one French battalion, a squadron of lancers and four guns to\r\nhold back Palafox, while with the 3,000 men that remained he executed\r\nseveral demonstrations against outlying parts of the defences of\r\nSaragossa, in order to distract the attention of the citizens.\r\n\r\nThis very risky plan was carried out with complete success. While\r\nthe Saragossans were warding off imaginary attacks, Chlopiski made\r\na forced march and fell upon Palafox at Epila on the night of June\r\n23-24. The Aragonese army was completely surprised and routed in a\r\nconfused engagement fought in the dark. Several hundred were cut up,\r\nand the town of Epila was sacked: Palafox fell back in disorder towards\r\nCalatayud and the mountains, while Chlopiski returned to the siege.\r\n\r\nThe Captain-General, much disconcerted by this disaster, resolved that\r\nhe would fight no more battles in the open, but merely reinforce the\r\ncity with the best of his soldiers and resist behind its walls. So\r\nsending back Versage and his levies to the hills, he made an enormous\r\ndetour with his handful of veteran troops and a few hundred irregulars,\r\nand re-entered Saragossa by the northern side, which still remained\r\nopen. He had great difficulty in holding his followers together, for\r\nmany (and especially his untrustworthy cavalry) wished to retire on\r\nValencia and to abandon the struggle in Aragon. But by appealing\r\nto their patriotism--‘he would give every man who insisted on it a\r\npassport for Valencia, but those who loved him would follow him’--he\r\nfinally carried off the whole force, and took somewhat over 1,000 men\r\nback to the besieged city [July 1].\r\n\r\nDuring his absence the condition of affairs in Saragossa had been\r\nconsiderably altered. On the one hand the defences had been much\r\nimproved: the gates had been strongly stockaded, and the walls had\r\nbeen thickened with earth and sandbags, and furnished with a continuous\r\n_banquette_, which had hitherto been wanting. On the other hand the\r\nFrench were beginning to receive reinforcements: on the twenty-sixth\r\nGeneral Verdier arrived with three battalions of his division (the\r\nsecond of Bessières’ corps)[118] and two _bataillons de marche_, in\r\nall some 3,000 or 3,500 men. From this time forward small bodies of\r\ntroops began to reach the besiegers at short intervals, including two\r\nmore Polish battalions[119], one battalion of French regulars, two\r\nPortuguese battalions (the last of the unfortunate division which was\r\non its way across Spain towards the Baltic), 1,000 National Guards\r\nof the Hautes Pyrénées and Basses Pyrénées, hastily sent across the\r\nfrontier from Bayonne, and three squadrons of cavalry[120]. What was\r\nmore important than the mere numbers was that they brought with them\r\nsiege-guns, in which Lefebvre had hitherto been entirely deficient.\r\nThese pieces came from the citadel of Pampeluna, and were part of those\r\nresources of which the French had so treacherously taken possession in\r\nthe preceding February.\r\n\r\n  [118] They belonged to the 14th Provisional Regiment, and the\r\n  accompanying corps were the 4th and 7th _bataillons de marche_.\r\n\r\n  [119] 3rd Regiment of the Vistula.\r\n\r\n  [120] 3rd, 6th, and 9th _escadrons de marche_.\r\n\r\nVerdier on his arrival superseded Lefebvre-Desnouettes, who was\r\nconsiderably his junior, and took charge of the siege. His first act\r\nwas to develop an attack on the Monte Torrero, the hill in the suburbs,\r\nbeyond the Huerba, which dominates, at a distance of 1,800 yards,\r\nthe southern front of the city. The Spaniards had neither encircled\r\nit with continuous lines, nor crowned it with any closed work. It\r\nwas protected only by two small batteries and some trenches covering\r\nthe most obvious points of attack. The garrison was composed of no\r\nmore than 500 men, half peasants, half regulars of the Regiment of\r\nEstremadura, of which three weak battalions had arrived from Tarrega\r\non the previous day (June 27)[121]. Verdier sent three columns, each\r\nof one battalion, against the more accessible parts of the position,\r\nand drove out the small defending force with ease. His task was made\r\nlighter by a piece of casual luck: on the night before the assault the\r\nmain powder-magazine of the Saragossans, situated in the Seminary,\r\nwas ignited by the carelessness of a workman, and blew up, killing\r\nmany persons and wrecking the Seminary itself and many houses in its\r\nvicinity. A few hours after this disaster had taken place, and while\r\nthe whole city was busy in extinguishing the conflagration, the French\r\nattack was delivered; hence the original garrison got no help from\r\nwithin the walls. But its own conduct was deplorably weak: the colonel\r\nin command[122] headed the rush to the rear, a piece of cowardice for\r\nwhich he was imprisoned and (after the siege had been raised) was sent\r\nbefore a court-martial and shot.\r\n\r\n  [121] The Regiment of Estremadura was so weak at the outbreak of\r\n  hostilities that its three battalions had only 770 men. It had\r\n  been hastily brought up to 900 bayonets before entering the city.\r\n\r\n  [122] His name was Vincente Falco; he belonged to the artillery.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the twenty-eighth Verdier began to construct heavy\r\nbreaching batteries on the slopes of the Monte Torrero, commanding\r\nall the southern side of the city. Others were thrown up on the\r\nsouth-western front, opposite the points which had been unsuccessfully\r\nassaulted twelve days before. On the thirtieth of June the works were\r\narmed with thirty siege-guns, four mortars, and twelve howitzers, which\r\nopened simultaneously on Saragossa at midnight, and continued to play\r\nupon the place for twenty-four hours, setting many houses on fire, and\r\nbreaching the flimsy ramparts in half a dozen places. The old castle\r\nof the Aljafferia was badly injured, and the gates of Portillo and the\r\nCarmen knocked out of shape: there were also large gaps in the convent\r\nof the Augustinians, and in the Misericordia, whose back wall formed\r\npart of the _enceinte_. All the unarmed population was forced to take\r\nrefuge in the cellars, or the more solidly built parts of the churches,\r\nwhile the fighting-men were trying to construct barricades behind the\r\nworst breaches, and to block up with sandbags, beams, and barrels all\r\nthe lanes that opened upon them.\r\n\r\nPalafox entered Saragossa on the morning of July 2, just in time\r\nto see Verdier launch his whole available infantry force upon the\r\nshattered western and southern fronts of the city. The assault was\r\nmade under much more favourable conditions than that of June 16, since\r\nthe strength of the storming columns was more than doubled, and the\r\ndefences had been terribly mishandled by the bombardment. On the other\r\nhand the garrison was in no degree shaken in spirit: the fire of the\r\nlast twenty-four hours had been much more dangerous to buildings than\r\nto men, and the results of the first assault had given the defenders\r\na confidence which they had not felt on the previous occasion. Hence\r\nit came to pass that of the six columns of assault not one succeeded\r\nin making a permanent lodgement within the walls. Even the isolated\r\ncastle of Aljafferia and the convent of San José, just outside the\r\nPorta Quemada, were finally left in the hands of the besieged, though\r\nthe latter was for some hours held by the French. The hardest fighting\r\nwas at the Portillo gate, where the assaulting battalions more than\r\nonce reached the dilapidated earthwork that covered the ingress to the\r\nnorth-western part of the city. It was here that there occurred the\r\nwell-known incident of the ‘Maid of Saragossa.’ The gunners at the\r\nsmall battery in the gate had been shot down one after another by the\r\nmusketry of the assailants, the final survivors falling even before\r\nthey could discharge the last gun that they had loaded. The infantry\r\nsupports were flinching and the French were closing in, when a young\r\nwoman named Agostina Zaragoza, whose lover (an artillery sergeant) had\r\njust fallen, rushed forward, snatched the lighted match from his dying\r\nhand, and fired the undischarged twenty-four-pounder into the head of\r\nthe storming column[123]. The enemy was shaken by a charge of grape\r\ndelivered at ten paces, the citizens, shamed by Agostina’s example,\r\nrushed back to reoccupy the battery, and the assault was beaten off.\r\nPalafox states that the incident occurred before his own eyes: he gave\r\nthe girl a commission as sub-lieutenant of artillery, and a warrant for\r\na life-pension: she was seen a year later by several English witnesses,\r\nserving with her battery in Andalusia[124].\r\n\r\n  [123] Sir Charles Vaughan was introduced to the heroine by\r\n  Palafox while he was staying in Saragossa in October. He\r\n  describes her as ‘a handsome young woman of the lower class,’ and\r\n  says that when he met her she was wearing on her sleeve a small\r\n  shield of honour with the name ‘Zaragoza’ inscribed on it. The\r\n  fact that the dead sergeant was her lover is given by Palafox\r\n  in his short narrative of the siege, which ought to be a good\r\n  authority enough.\r\n\r\n  [124] Napier, with all his prejudice against the Spaniards, does\r\n  not venture to absolutely reject the story. ‘Romantic tales\r\n  of women rallying the troops and leading them forward at the\r\n  most dangerous period of the siege were current; their truth\r\n  may be doubted. Yet when suddenly environed with horrors, the\r\n  sensitiveness of women, driving them to a kind of frenzy, might\r\n  have produced actions above the heroism of men’ (i. 45). W.\r\n  Jacob, M.P., in his _Travels in the South of Spain in 1809-10_\r\n  (p. 123), says that he met Agostina at Seville, wearing a blue\r\n  artillery tunic, with one epaulette, over a short skirt; she was\r\n  present when Lord Wellesley entered Seville, and was welcomed by\r\n  the Junta.\r\n\r\nThe fruitless attack of July 2 cost the French 200 killed and 300\r\nwounded. The Saragossan garrison lost somewhat less, in spite of\r\nthe bombardment, since they had been fighting under cover against\r\nenemies who had to expose themselves whenever they got near the wall.\r\nVerdier resolved for the future to shun attempts at escalade, and to\r\nbegin a regular siege. He commenced on the third of July to construct\r\nparallels, for a main attack on the southern side of the place, and\r\na secondary attack on the north-western. He also threw a detachment\r\nacross the Ebro [July 11], to close the hitherto undisturbed access to\r\nthe city through the suburb of San Lazaro and the stone bridge. The\r\nforce which could be spared for this object from an army of no more\r\nthan 12,000 or 13,000 men was not really sufficient to hold the left\r\nbank of the Ebro, and merely made ingress and egress difficult without\r\nentirely preventing it. On two or three occasions when considerable\r\nbodies of Spaniards presented themselves, the French could do no more\r\nthan skirmish with them and try to cut off the convoys which they were\r\nbringing to the city. They could not exclude them, and for the whole\r\nremainder of the siege the communications of the Saragossans with the\r\nopen country were never entirely closed[125].\r\n\r\n  [125] Foy exaggerates considerably when he says that from July\r\n  12 onward ‘the blockade of Saragossa was complete’ (iii. 300).\r\n  Reinforcements entered on several subsequent occasions.\r\n\r\nBy July 15, Verdier’s trenches were commencing to work up close\r\nto the walls, and the next ten days of the month were occupied in\r\ndesperate struggles for the convents of San José, of the Capuchins and\r\nTrinitarians, which lie outside the city near the Carmen and Porta\r\nQuemada gates. By the twenty-fourth the French had occupied them,\r\nconnected them with their approaches, and begun to establish in them\r\nbreaching batteries. Another, but less powerful, attack was directed\r\nagainst the Portillo gate. The mortars and howitzers bombarded the\r\ncity continuously from the first to the third. But it was not till the\r\ndawn of August 4 that the heavy guns were ready to begin their task of\r\nbattering down the gates and walls of Saragossa. After five hours of\r\nsteady firing the Spanish batteries were silenced, and several breaches\r\nhad been made, mostly in or about the Convent of Santa Engracia, at the\r\nsouthernmost point of the city. The streets behind it had been terribly\r\nshattered by the previous bombardment, and many buildings destroyed,\r\nnotably the central hospital, from which the Spaniards had to remove,\r\nunder a terrible hail of shells, more than 500 sick and wounded, as\r\nwell as a number of lunatics and idiots: the institution had been used\r\nas an asylum before the outbreak of the war. Many of these unfortunate\r\ncreatures were destroyed by the besiegers’ fire[126], as were also no\r\nsmall number of the wounded and of their doctors and nurses.\r\n\r\n  [126] Caballero and Toreño put the distressing scenes at the\r\n  hospital and the escape of the lunatics during the assault on the\r\n  4th, but Arteche seems more correct in placing them during the\r\n  bombardment of the preceding day.\r\n\r\nPalafox and his brother the marquis remained near Santa Engracia,\r\ntrying to encourage their followers to repair the barricades behind\r\nthe breaches, and to loophole and strengthen those of the houses\r\nwhich still stood firm. But amid the dreadful and unceasing storm\r\nof projectiles it was hard to keep the men together, and most of\r\nthe projected retrenchments were battered down before they could be\r\nfinished. At two o’clock in the afternoon of the fourth, Verdier let\r\nloose his storming columns, composed of four Polish and nine French\r\nbattalions[127]. They were directed in three bodies against three\r\nseparate breaches, the easternmost in the Convent of Santa Engracia,\r\nthe second at the gate of the same name, the third more to the left,\r\nin the wall near the gate of the Carmen. All three were successful\r\nin forcing their way into the city: the defences had been completely\r\nshattered, and at one point 300 continuous yards of the outer wall had\r\nfallen. The Spaniards clung for some time to the cloisters and church\r\nof Santa Engracia, but were at last expelled or exterminated, and 1,000\r\nyards of the _enceinte_ with the adjoining buildings were in the hands\r\nof the French.\r\n\r\n  [127] I find in the _Vaughan Papers_ the following note: ‘General\r\n  Lefebvre-Desnouettes was residing at Cheltenham on parole,\r\n  having been taken prisoner at Benavente by Lord Paget. I went to\r\n  Cheltenham on May 27, 1809, for the express purpose of seeing\r\n  the general. He told me that he had advanced at first with no\r\n  more than 3,000 men, but that after General Verdier joined him,\r\n  the French force employed against Saragossa was 15,000 men. I\r\n  understood that in the attack of July 2 and the previous fighting\r\n  they lost 2,000 men, and that their total loss in the whole siege\r\n  was 4,000, including three generals wounded.’ _Nap. Corresp._\r\n  (xvii. 389, 426) calls the whole force before Saragossa on August\r\n  2, 17,300 men. But there seems to have been present in all only--\r\n\r\n  (1)  Lefebvre-Desnouettes’ column:\r\n            { 2nd of the Vistula (1st and 2nd batts.)      1376\r\n  Brigade   { 70th of the line (3rd batt.)                  379\r\n  Grandjean { 4th _bataillon de marche_                     581\r\n            { 6th ditto                                     655 =   2991\r\n\r\n            { 1st of the Vistula (1st and 2nd batts.)      1243\r\n  Brigade   { 1st supplementary regiment of the Legions\r\n  Habert    { of Reserve (1st and 2nd batts.)              1030\r\n            { 47th of the line (3rd batt.)                  420\r\n            { 15th ditto (4th batt.)                        411 =   3104\r\n\r\n            { Regiment of Polish Lancers                    717\r\n  Cavalry   { 5th _escadron de marche_                      217 =    934\r\n\r\n  (2) Division of Gomez Freire:\r\n        14th Provisional Regiment (1st, 2nd, and\r\n          3rd batts.)                                      1173\r\n        7th _bataillon de marche_                           334\r\n        5th Portuguese infantry                             265\r\n        Portuguese Cazadores                                288 =   2060\r\n\r\n  (3) Column of Colonel Piré (arrived June 29):\r\n        3rd of the Vistula (1st and 2nd batts.)            1332\r\n        National Guards _d’élite_ (two batts.)              971\r\n        3rd, 8th, and 9th _escadrons de marche_             275 =   2578\r\n\r\n  (4) Bazancourt’s Brigade (arrived August 1):\r\n        14th of the line (1st and 2nd batts.)              1488\r\n        44th ditto (1st and 2nd batts.)                    1614\r\n        11th _escadron de marche_                           205 =   3307\r\n\r\n  (5)  Artillery and train                                  561 =    561\r\n                                                                  ------\r\n                                            Total                 15,535\r\n\r\n  These are mainly Belmas’s figures. He mentions a battalion of\r\n  the 16th of the line as present at the great assault. There\r\n  must be some error here, as that regiment was not in Spain. It\r\n  is probably a misprint for the 70th of the line, which is not\r\n  mentioned by him as present, though it certainly was so.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment, apparently, that Verdier sent in a\r\n_parlementaire_ with the laconic note--‘Head Quarters, Santa Engracia.\r\nCapitulation?’ To which Palafox returned the well-known reply--‘Head\r\nQuarters, Saragossa. War to the knife[128].’\r\n\r\n  [128] The story sounds theatrical, but is vouched for by good\r\n  authorities, Vaughan and Palafox himself, who chose the words\r\n  for the type of the reverse of the medal that was issued to the\r\n  defenders of Saragossa (see Arteche, ii. 394).\r\n\r\nAll through the afternoon of the fourth of August, the French slowly\r\npushed their way up the streets which lead northward towards the\r\nCoso, the main thoroughfare of Saragossa. They could only get forward\r\nby storming each house, and turning each barricade that offered\r\nresistance, so that their progress was very slow. While inflicting\r\nterrible losses on the Spaniards, they were also suffering very heavily\r\nthemselves. But they drove a broad wedge into the city, till finally\r\nthey reached and crossed the Coso, halfway between the southern wall\r\nand the river. In the streets beyond the Coso their impetus seemed to\r\nhave exhausted itself: many of the men were too tired to press forward\r\nany longer; others turned aside to plunder the churches and the better\r\nsort of houses[129]. Verdier tried to cut his way to the great bridge,\r\nso as to divide the defenders into two separate bodies, and was so far\r\nsuccessful that many of the Spaniards began to troop off across the\r\nriver into the suburb of San Lazaro. But he himself was wounded, his\r\nmain column lost its way in the narrow side-streets, and the attack\r\ndied down.\r\n\r\n  [129] Napier maintains (i. 45) that the city was saved only\r\n  because the French fell to pillaging, a contention which seems\r\n  very unjust to the Saragossans.\r\n\r\nIn the late afternoon there was almost a suspension of hostilities, and\r\nthe firing slackened for a space. But at last the Aragonese, encouraged\r\nby the exhaustion of their enemies, began to resume the offensive.\r\nThe fugitives who had crossed to the northern side of the Ebro were\r\nhustled together and driven back by their leaders, while a loaded gun\r\nwas placed on the bridge to prevent their return. The garrison of\r\nthe eastern front, which had not been seriously attacked, sent all\r\nthe reinforcements that it could spare into the centre of the town.\r\nAt dusk masses of Spaniards debouched from the neighbourhood of the\r\ntwo cathedrals, and began to assail the positions held by the French\r\nbeyond the line of the Coso. The first charge into the open street is\r\nrecorded to have been led by a monk[130] and sixteen peasants, every\r\none of whom were killed or wounded; but endless reinforcements poured\r\nout of every lane, and the exhausted French began to lose ground.\r\nThe fighting was of that deadly sort in which the question has to be\r\nsettled, whether the defenders of the houses in a street can shoot down\r\ntheir assailants, exposed in the roadway, before the latter can burst\r\ninto each separate dwelling and exterminate its garrison in detail.\r\nOften the French held the upper stories long after the Spaniards had\r\nseized the ground floor, and the staircases had to be stormed one after\r\nthe other. It was natural that in such struggles the defenders should\r\nreceive no quarter. Though the fight raged with many variations of\r\nfortune in all the central parts of the city, there was after a time\r\nno doubt that the Aragonese were gaining ground. The French detachments\r\nwhich had penetrated furthest into the place were gradually cut off and\r\nexterminated; the main bodies of the columns drew back and strengthened\r\nthemselves in two large stone buildings, the convents of San Francisco\r\nand San Diego. At nightfall they retained only a wedge-like section of\r\nthe city, whose apex near San Francisco just touched the southern side\r\nof the Coso, while its base was formed by the line of wall between the\r\ngates of Santa Engracia and the Carmen.\r\n\r\n  [130] Perhaps his name, Fray Ignacio de Santaromana, deserves as\r\n  much remembrance as that of Agostina. His conduct in a critical\r\n  moment was just as inspiring and told as much as hers (see\r\n  Arteche, ii. 406).\r\n\r\nThe French had lost nearly 2,000 men in the struggle: the engineer\r\nBelmas gives the total as 462 killed and 1,505 wounded[131], more than\r\na fifth of the troops which had actually been engaged in the assault.\r\nAmong the Saragossans, who before the street-fighting began had been\r\nsubjected to a severe bombardment for many hours, the casualties must\r\nhave been nearly as great. But they could spare combatants more easily\r\nthan their enemies: indeed they had more men than muskets, and as each\r\ndefender fell there was a rush of the unarmed to get possession of his\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\n  [131] Arteche accuses Belmas of giving only 505 wounded,\r\n  remarking that Verdier stated the higher number of 900. But my\r\n  edition of Belmas (Paris, 1836) distinctly says ‘quinze cent\r\n  cinq blessés’ (ii. 64). Napier gives no figures at all: Thiers,\r\n  understating French losses in his usual style, speaks of 300 dead\r\n  and 900 wounded.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of August 4-5 both sides, fatigued though they were,\r\nset to work to cover themselves with barricades and works constructed\r\nwith the débris of ruined houses. In the morning both French and\r\nSpaniards had rough but continuous lines of defence, those of the\r\nlatter circling round those of the former, with nothing but the\r\nwidth of a narrow street between them. Wherever there was anything\r\napproaching an open space cannon had been brought up to sweep it. Where\r\nthe houses still stood firm, communications had been made between them\r\nby breaking holes through the party walls. In the streets the corpses\r\nof both sides lay thick, for under the deadly cross-fire no one dared\r\nventure out to remove them: in a day or two the sanitary conditions\r\nwould be horrible.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile both besiegers and besieged were too exhausted to undertake\r\nany more serious operations, and the fighting sank to little more than\r\na desultory fusillade between enemies equally well protected by their\r\ndefences. Such interest as there was in the operations of August 5-6\r\nlay outside the walls of Saragossa. On the afternoon of the day of\r\nthe great assault a column of Spanish troops from Catalonia--two line\r\nbattalions and 2,000 or 3,000 new levies and armed peasants--arrived at\r\nVillamayor on the north of the Ebro, only seven miles from the city.\r\nIt escorted a much-desired convoy of ammunition, for the supplies in\r\nthe city were running very low. While the fighting was still raging\r\nin the streets Palafox rode out of the suburb of San Lazaro with 100\r\ndragoons and joined this force. On the next morning (August 5) he\r\nskirmished with the French troops which lay beyond the Ebro, and passed\r\ninto the city one veteran battalion and a few wagons of munitions. He\r\nthen proposed to attack the detached French brigade (that of Piré)\r\nwith his whole remaining force on the next day, in order to clear the\r\nnorthern front, and to send the rest of his convoy--no less than 200\r\nwagons--into Saragossa. But on the same night he received news of the\r\nbattle of Baylen and the surrender of Dupont’s army. Moreover, he was\r\ninformed that a division of the army of Valencia, under Saint-March,\r\nwas on the way to reinforce him. This induced him to halt for two days,\r\nto see whether the French would not raise the siege without further\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\nVerdier had got the same intelligence at the same hour, with orders\r\nto be ready to retreat at a moment’s notice, and to avoid entangling\r\nhimself in further engagements. He was preparing to withdraw, when on\r\nthe seventh he received supplementary dispatches from Madrid, with\r\ndirections to hold on for the present, and to keep the Saragossans\r\noccupied, without, however, compromising himself too much. Accordingly\r\nhe resumed the bombardment, and began to throw into the city an immense\r\nnumber of shells: for he saw that when his retreat was definitely\r\nordered, he would not be able to carry off with him the vast stores of\r\nmunitions that he had accumulated in his camp.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Saragossa.]\r\n\r\nSeeing that the French did not move, Palafox attacked the covering\r\nforce on the left bank of the Ebro on August 8. His enemies were very\r\ninferior in numbers and had been told not to risk anything, considering\r\nthe delicate state of affairs. Accordingly the relieving force crossed\r\nthe river Gallego, pushed back Piré’s 2,000 men in a long skirmishing\r\nfight, and ultimately established themselves on ground just outside\r\nthe suburb of San Lazaro: the convoy, under cover of the fighting,\r\nsuccessfully entered the city over the great bridge. That night Verdier\r\nwithdrew Piré’s brigade across the river, thus leaving the whole\r\nnorthern front of the place free from blockade. Clearly this could only\r\nmean that he was about to raise the siege, but for five days more he\r\ncontinued to ravage the central parts of the city with his bombs, and\r\nto bicker at the barricades with the Saragossans. But on the thirteenth\r\nthe Spaniards noted that his camps seemed to be growing empty, and on\r\nthe fourteenth a series of explosions told them that he was abandoning\r\nhis siege works. Santa Engracia and the other points held inside the\r\ncity were all destroyed on that day, and the ammunition which could not\r\nbe carried off was blown up. The guns which had been pressed forward\r\ninto the ruined streets were spiked and left behind, as it would have\r\nbeen impossible to extricate them under the Spanish fire. Of those in\r\nthe outer batteries some were thrown into the canal, others disabled by\r\nhaving their trunnions knocked off, others merely spiked. Altogether\r\nno less than fifty-four pieces, all more or less injured, but many\r\nsusceptible of repair, were left behind to serve as trophies for the\r\nSaragossans.\r\n\r\nFinally Verdier withdrew by slow marches up the Ebro to Tudela, where\r\nhe took post on August 17. He had lost in all over 3,500 men in his\r\nlong-continued struggle with the heroic city. The Aragonese must have\r\nsuffered at least as much, but the figures are of course impossible to\r\nverify. They said that their casualties amounted to no more than 2,000,\r\nbut this must surely be an understatement, for Palafox says that by\r\nAugust 1 there were of his original 7,000 levies only 3,500 left under\r\narms. Even allowing for heavy diminution by desertion and dispersion,\r\nthis implies very serious losses in action, and these seven Aragonese\r\nbattalions formed only a part of the garrison, which counted 13,000 men\r\non August 13. Probably the unembodied citizens and peasants suffered\r\nin a still heavier proportion than troops which had received even a\r\nsmall measure of organization. If the whole losses came to 4,500 it\r\nwould not be surprising--but nothing can be stated with certainty.\r\nYet whatever were their sufferings, the Saragossans had turned over\r\na new page in the history of the art of war. They had defended for\r\ntwo months an unfortified place, by means of extemporized barricades,\r\nretrenchments, and earthworks, and had proved their ability to resist\r\neven a formidable train of siege artillery. If the news of Dupont’s\r\ndisaster had not arrived in time to save them, they would no doubt have\r\nsuccumbed in the end, as must any besieged place which is not sooner or\r\nlater relieved from the outside. But meanwhile they had accomplished\r\na rare feat: almost unaided by regular troops, almost destitute of\r\ntrained artillerymen and engineers, they had held at bay a force which\r\nNapoleon at the commencement of the siege would have supposed to be\r\nequal to the task of conquering not only Aragon, but the whole eastern\r\nside of the Iberian Peninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS IN THE NORTH: BATTLE OF MEDINA DE RIO SECO\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Lefebvre-Desnouettes and Verdier were making their long series of\r\nattacks on Saragossa, matters were coming to a head in the north-west\r\nof Spain. The army of Galicia had at last descended into the plains,\r\nand commenced to threaten the right flank of Bessières and the\r\ncommunications between Burgos and Madrid. This forward movement was due\r\nneither to the Galician Junta, nor to the officer whom they had placed\r\nin command of their army, but to the obstinate persistence of Cuesta,\r\nwho had not in the least learnt the lesson of caution from his defeat\r\nat Cabezon, and was eager to fight a pitched battle with all the forces\r\nthat could be collected in Northern Spain.\r\n\r\nThe resources at hand were not inconsiderable: in Galicia, or on the\r\nway thither from Portugal, were no less than thirty-nine battalions\r\nof regular infantry--though most of them were very weak: there were\r\nalso thirteen battalions of embodied militia, some thirty guns, and a\r\nhandful of cavalry (not more than 150 sabres). The Junta had placed\r\nin command, after the murder of the captain-general Filanghieri, a\r\ncomparatively young general--Joachim Blake, one of those many soldiers\r\nof fortune of Irish blood who formed such a notable element in the\r\nSpanish army. When the insurrection broke out he had been merely\r\ncolonel of the regiment named ‘the Volunteers of the Crown’: he had\r\nnever had more than three battalions to manage before he found himself\r\nplaced at the head of the whole Galician army. Though a most unlucky\r\ngeneral--half a dozen times he seems to have been the victim of ill\r\nfortune, for which he was hardly responsible--Blake was in real merit\r\nfar above the average of the Spanish commanders. He had neither the\r\nslackness nor the arrogance which were the besetting sins of so many\r\nof the Peninsular generals: and his dauntless courage was not combined\r\nwith recklessness or careless over-confidence. He showed from the first\r\nvery considerable organizing power: all his efforts were directed to\r\nthe task of inducing the Junta and the people of Galicia to allow him\r\nto draft the crowds of recruits who flocked to his banner into the old\r\nregiments of the line and the militia, instead of forming them into new\r\ncorps. With some trouble he carried his point, and was able to bring\r\nup to their full complement most of the old battalions: of new units\r\nvery few[132] were created. When he took the field it was only the old\r\n_cadres_ thus brought up to strength that accompanied him, not raw and\r\nunsteady troops of new organization.\r\n\r\n  [132] The best known was the _batallon literario_, composed of\r\n  the students of the University of Santiago.\r\n\r\nAfter hastily concentrating and brigading his army at Lugo, Blake led\r\nthem to the edge of the mountains which divide Galicia from the plains\r\nof Leon. It was his original intention to stand at bay on the hills,\r\nand force the French to attack him. With this object he occupied the\r\npasses of Manzanal, Fuencebadon, and Puebla de Sanabria, the only\r\nplaces where roads of importance penetrate into the Galician uplands\r\n[June 23]. His whole field force, distributed into four divisions and a\r\n‘vanguard brigade’ of light troops, amounted to some 25,000 men fit for\r\nthe field: in addition, 8,000 or 10,000 new levies were being organized\r\nbehind him, but he refused--with great wisdom--to bring them to the\r\nfront during his first movements.\r\n\r\nOn Blake’s left flank were other Spanish troops: the Junta of the\r\nAsturias had raised some 15,000 men: but these--unlike the Galician\r\narmy--were utterly raw and untrained. Of old troops there was but one\r\nsingle militia battalion among them. The Junta had dispersed them in\r\nsmall bodies all along the eastern and southern side of the province,\r\narraying them to cover not only the high road from Madrid and Leon to\r\nOviedo, but every impracticable mule-path that crosses the Cantabrian\r\nMountains. By this unwise arrangement the Asturian army was weak at\r\nevery point: it was impossible to concentrate more than 5,000 men for\r\nthe defence of any part of the long and narrow province. The fact was\r\nthat the Junta looked solely to the defence of its own land, and had\r\nno conception that the protection of the Asturias should be treated as\r\nonly a section of the great problem of the protection of the whole of\r\nNorthern Spain.\r\n\r\nWhile the Galicians and the Asturians were taking up this purely\r\ndefensive attitude, they had forgotten to reckon with one factor in\r\ntheir neighbourhood. Right in front of them lay the old Captain-General\r\nof Castile, with the wrecks of the army that had been so signally\r\nrouted at Cabezon. He had retired to Benavente on the Esla, and there\r\nhad halted, finding that he was not pursued by Lasalle. Here he\r\nreorganized his scattered Castilian levies into three battalions, and\r\nraised three more in the province of Leon. He had still 300 or 400\r\nregular cavalry, but not a single gun. Quite undismayed by his late\r\ndefeat, he persisted in wishing to fight in the plain, and began to\r\nsend urgent messages both to Blake and to the Juntas of Asturias and\r\nGalicia, begging them to send down their armies from the hills, and\r\naid him in making a dash at Valladolid, with the object of cutting off\r\nBessières’ communications with Madrid, and so disarranging the whole\r\nsystem of Napoleon’s plan for the conquest of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe Asturians, partly from a well-justified disbelief in Cuesta’s\r\nability, partly from a selfish desire to retain all their troops for\r\nthe defence of their own province, refused to stir. They sent the\r\nCaptain-General a modest reinforcement, two battalions of the newly\r\nraised regiment of Covadonga, but refused any more aid. Instead, they\r\nsuggested that Cuesta should fall back on Leon and the southern slope\r\nof the Asturian hills, so as to threaten from thence any advance of the\r\nFrench into the plains of Leon.\r\n\r\nBut the Galician Junta showed themselves less unyielding. Despite of\r\nthe remonstrances of Blake, who was set on maintaining the defensive,\r\nand holding the passes above Astorga, they consented to allow their\r\narmy to move down into the plain of Old Castile and to join Cuesta.\r\nAfter some fruitless remonstrances Blake moved forward with the bulk of\r\nhis host, leaving behind him his second division to hold the passes,\r\nwhile with the other three and his vanguard brigade he marched on\r\nBenavente [July 5].\r\n\r\nOn July 10 the armies of Galicia and Castile met at Villalpando, and a\r\nbrisk quarrel at once broke out between their commanders. Cuesta was\r\nfor attacking the French at once: Blake pointed out that for an army\r\nwith no more than thirty guns and 500 or 600 cavalry to offer battle\r\nin the plains was sheer madness. The Irish general had the larger\r\nand more effective army, but Cuesta was thirteen years his senior as\r\nlieutenant-general, and insisted on assuming command of the combined\r\nhost in accordance with the normal rules of military precedence. After\r\nsome fruitless resistance Blake yielded, and the whole Spanish army\r\nmoved forward on Valladolid: all that Cuesta would grant on the side\r\nof caution was that the third Galician division, 5,000 strong, should\r\nbe left as a reserve at Benavente. Even this was a mistake: if the two\r\ngenerals were to fight at all, they should have put every available man\r\nin line, and have endeavoured at all costs to induce the Asturians also\r\nto co-operate with them. They might have had in all for the oncoming\r\nbattle 40,000 men, instead of 22,000, if the outlying troops had been\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nA blow from the north-west was precisely what Napoleon at Bayonne\r\nand Savary at Madrid had been expecting for some weeks. Both of them\r\nwere perfectly conscious that any check inflicted on Bessières in\r\nOld Castile would wreck the whole plan of invasion. So much of the\r\nmarshal’s _corps d’armée_ had been distracted towards Saragossa, that\r\nit was clearly necessary to reinforce him. From Madrid Savary sent up\r\nhalf of the troops of the Imperial Guard which had hitherto been in\r\nthe capital--three battalions of fusiliers (first regiment) and three\r\nsquadrons of cavalry[133]. Napoleon afterwards blamed him severely for\r\nnot having sent more, saying that from the mass of troops in and about\r\nMadrid he might have spared another complete division--that of Gobert,\r\nthe second division of Moncey’s corps. Without its aid the Emperor\r\nhalf-expected that Bessières might be checked, if the Galicians came\r\ndown in full force[134]. He himself sent up from Bayonne nearly all the\r\ntroops which were at that moment under his hand, ten veteran battalions\r\njust arrived from Germany, forming the division of General Mouton.\r\n\r\n  [133] Oddly enough, in the Duke of Rovigo’s own _Mémoires_ the\r\n  statement is made that these troops arrived too late to fight at\r\n  Rio Seco, a curious error (ii. 248).\r\n\r\n  [134] See the dispatch of July 13, to Savary, and that of the\r\n  same day to King Joseph (_Nap. Corresp._, 14,191).\r\n\r\nThe reinforcements being hurried on to Bessières by forced marches,\r\nthat general found himself on July 9 at the head of a force with\r\nwhich he thought that he might venture to attack Blake and Cuesta. If\r\nthey had brought with them all their troops, and had called in the\r\nAsturians, it is probable that the marshal would have found himself too\r\nweak to face them: fortunately for him he had only five-ninths of the\r\narmy of Galicia and Cuesta’s miserable levies in front of him. His\r\nown fighting force was formed of odd fragments of all the divisions\r\nwhich formed his _corps d’armée_: large sections of each of them were\r\nleft behind to guard his communications with France, and others were\r\nbefore Saragossa. Bessières marched from Burgos with the brigade of the\r\nImperial Guard: at Palencia he picked up Lasalle’s cavalry with half\r\nMouton’s newly arrived division of veterans (the second brigade was\r\nleft at Vittoria) and a small part of Merle’s division, which had been\r\nhastily brought over the mountains from Santander to join him. There\r\nwas also present the larger half of Verdier’s division, of which the\r\nrest was now in Aragon with its commander[135].\r\n\r\n  [135] Bessières’ army seems to have consisted of the following\r\n  elements:--\r\n\r\n                                                       _Infantry._\r\n                                                               _Cavalry._\r\n\r\n  (1) One regiment of the Fusiliers of the Imperial\r\n        Guard (three batts.)                                1,900\r\n  Three squadrons of cavalry of the Imperial Guard                   300\r\n\r\n  (2) From Verdier’s Division:\r\n  Ducos’      {13th Provisional Regiment (four batts.)      2,000\r\n  Brigade     {14th Provisional Regiment (one batt.)[a]       500\r\n\r\n  Sabathier’s {17th Provisional Regiment (four batts.)    }\r\n  Brigade     {18th Provisional Regiment (four batts.)[b] } 2,800\r\n\r\n  (3) From Merle’s Division:\r\n  D’Armagnac’s {47th of the Line (one batt.)[c] }\r\n  Brigade      {3rd Swiss Regiment (one batt.)  }           1,600\r\n\r\n  (4) From Mouton’s Division:\r\n  Reynaud’s   {4th Léger (three batts.)         }\r\n  Brigade     {15th of the Line (two batts.)[d] }           3,000\r\n\r\n  (5) Lasalle’s Cavalry Brigade:\r\n  10th Chasseurs}\r\n  22nd Chasseurs}                                                    850\r\n                                                           ------  -----\r\n                                                           11,800  1,150\r\n\r\n  We may add 750 men for the five batteries of artillery and\r\n  the train, and so get a total strength of 13,700. Napoleon\r\n  (_Corresp._, 14,213) called the force 15,000.\r\n\r\n  [a] The other three batts. of the 14th were with Verdier at\r\n  Saragossa. This odd battalion was in the battle attached to\r\n  D’Armagnac’s brigade. Merle was given Ducos’ and D’Armagnac’s\r\n  brigades to make up a division.\r\n\r\n  [b] These battalions were much weakened by detachments.\r\n\r\n  [c] A very strong battalion: it was 1,200 strong on June 1, and\r\n  must still have had 1,000 bayonets.\r\n\r\n  [d] Both regiments were incomplete, having dropped men at\r\n  Vittoria and Burgos.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of July 13, Lasalle’s light cavalry got in touch with\r\nthe outposts of the Spaniards near Medina de Rio Seco, and reported\r\nthat Blake and Cuesta were present in force. On the next morning\r\nBessières marched before daybreak from Palencia, and just as the\r\nday was growing hot, discovered the enemy drawn up on rising ground\r\na little to the east of the small town which has given its name to\r\nthe battle. Blake had 15,000 infantry and 150 cavalry with twenty\r\nguns[136]; Cuesta 6,000 infantry and 550 cavalry, but not a single\r\ncannon. They outnumbered Bessières by nearly two to one in foot\r\nsoldiery, but had little more than half his number of horse, and only\r\ntwo-thirds as many guns.\r\n\r\n  [136] In the _Vaughan Papers_ I find a ‘Journal of the operations\r\n  of General Blake,’ by some officer of his staff, unnamed. It\r\n  gives the force of the Galician army at Rio Seco as follows:--\r\n\r\n                      _Officers._\r\n                            _Sergeants._\r\n                                 _Drummers,&c._\r\n                               _Veteran rank and file._\r\n                                                    _Recruits._\r\n                                                                  _Total._\r\n\r\n  Vanguard:\r\n      Gen.

But if fighting was to be done, a wise man\r\nwould at any rate have chosen a good position, where his flanks would\r\nbe covered from turning movements and inaccessible to the enemy’s very\r\nsuperior force of horsemen. The old Captain-General cared nothing for\r\nsuch caution: he had merely drawn up his army on a gentle hillside,\r\nsomewhat cut up by low stone walls, but practicable for cavalry at\r\nnearly every point. His flanks had no protection of any kind from the\r\nlie of the ground: behind his back was the town of Medina de Rio Seco,\r\nand the dry bed of the Sequillo river, obstacles which would tend to\r\nmake a retreat difficult to conduct in orderly fashion. But a retreat\r\nwas the last thing in Cuesta’s thoughts.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Battle of Medina de Rio Seco. July 14, 1808.]\r\n\r\nBad as was the position selected, the way in which it was occupied was\r\nstill more strange. The Captain-General had divided his host into two\r\nhalves, the one consisting of the first division of the army of\r\nGalicia and of the vanguard brigade, the other of the fourth Galician\r\ndivision and the raw ‘Army of Castile.’ Blake with the first-named\r\nforce was drawn up in a short, compact formation, three lines deep,\r\nat the south-eastern front of the hill, the ‘Plateau of Valdecuevas,’\r\nas it is called. His right looked down into the plain, his left, in\r\nthe centre of the plateau, stood quite ‘in the air.’ But nearly a mile\r\nto his left rear, and quite out of sight, lay the other half of the\r\narmy, just too far off to protect Blake’s exposed flank if it should be\r\nattacked, and in a very bad position for defending itself. Why Cuesta\r\nranged his left wing (or second line, if it may so be called) low down\r\non the reverse slope of the plateau, and in a place where it could not\r\neven see Blake’s corps, it is impossible to conceive. Toreño hazards\r\nthe guess that, in his arrogant confidence, he placed Blake where he\r\nwould have to bear the stress of the battle, and might probably lose\r\nground, intending to come up himself with the left wing and restore the\r\nfight when his colleague should be sufficiently humbled. Such a plan\r\nwould not have been outside the scope of the old man’s selfish pride.\r\n\r\nBessières, marching up from the east, came in sight of the Spaniards\r\nin the early morning. He at once deployed his whole army, and advanced\r\nin battle array over the plain. In front was a slight cavalry screen\r\nof Lasalle’s chasseurs; next came Mouton’s division, deployed to the\r\nright, and Merle’s division, with Sabathier’s brigade, to the left of\r\nthe country-road which leads, over the plateau, towards Medina de Rio\r\nSeco. The Imperial Guard, horse and foot, and the bulk of Lasalle’s\r\ncavalry brigade were in reserve behind the centre. On getting near\r\nthe enemy’s position, Bessières soon discovered the two halves of the\r\nSpanish army and the broad gap which lay between them. His mind was at\r\nonce made up: he proposed to contain Cuesta with a small force, and\r\nto fall upon and envelop Blake with the rest of his army before the\r\nCaptain-General of Castile could come to his aid. This excellent plan\r\nwas carried out to the letter, thanks to the incapacity of Cuesta.\r\n\r\nNot far east of the plateau of Valdecuevas lay an isolated eminence,\r\nthe mound of Monclin: on it the marshal drew up the greater part of\r\nhis artillery (twenty guns) which began to batter Blake’s front line:\r\nthe Galician batteries replied, and held their own though outnumbered\r\nby two to one. Then Sabathier’s eight weak battalions deployed and\r\ncommenced a cautious attack upon Blake’s front: this was not to be\r\npressed home for a time. Meanwhile Merle’s seven battalions pushed into\r\nthe fight, continuing Sabathier’s line to the south-west and trying to\r\nenvelop Blake’s southern flank. They forced the Galicians to throw back\r\ntheir right wing, and to keep continually extending it, in order to\r\navoid being turned. The Spaniards fought not amiss, and for some hour\r\nor more the battle was almost stationary.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, far to the French right, Mouton’s five battalions were\r\nexecuting a cautious demonstration against Cuesta’s forces, across\r\nthe northern folds of the plateau. The old general allowed himself to\r\nbe completely occupied by this trifling show of attack, and made no\r\nmovement to aid Blake’s wing. The gap between him and his colleague was\r\nnot filled up. Then came the sudden development of Bessières’ plan:\r\nSabathier and Merle were told to attack in earnest, and while Blake was\r\ndeeply engaged with their fifteen battalions, Lasalle rode into the\r\nopen space on the left of the Galicians, formed up the 22nd _chasseurs\r\nà cheval_ at right angles to the Spanish line, and charged in furiously\r\nupon Blake’s flank. The unfortunate troops on whom the blow fell were\r\ndeployed in line, and utterly unprepared for a cavalry shock from the\r\nside. The first battalion which received the attack broke at once and\r\nran in upon the second[137]: in a few minutes Blake’s whole left wing\r\nfell down like a pack of cards, each corps as it fled sweeping away\r\nthat next to it. The French infantry, advancing at the same moment, ran\r\nin with the bayonet, seized the Spanish guns, and hustled the Galicians\r\nwestward along the plateau in a mob. Blake’s troops were only saved\r\nfrom complete destruction by the steadiness of a Navarrese battalion,\r\nwhich formed square to cover the retreat, and at the cost of one-third\r\nof its strength allowed the other corps to get a long start in their\r\nflight. They retired due west, and crossed the Sequillo to the south of\r\nthe town of Rio Seco before they could be rallied.\r\n\r\n  [137] The flank battalion which started the rout was the\r\n  ‘Regiment of Buenos Ayres,’ a provisional corps which had been\r\n  formed out of the prisoners lately returned from England, who\r\n  had been captured during our unlucky South American expedition,\r\n  before Whitelock’s final fiasco (see the ‘Journal of Blake’s\r\n  Operations,’ in the _Vaughan Papers_).\r\n\r\nIt was now the turn of Cuesta to suffer. The moment that Blake was\r\ndisposed of, Bessières marched over the hill towards the other half\r\nof the Spanish army: leaving some of Lasalle’s cavalry and Sabathier’s\r\nbrigade to pursue the routed corps, he formed the whole of his\r\nremaining troops in a line, bringing up the reserve of the Imperial\r\nGuard to make its centre, while Mouton formed the right wing and the\r\ntwo brigades of Merle the left. Cuesta, outnumbered and attacked down\r\nhill, would have done wisely to retreat and to seek for shelter in and\r\nbehind the town of Rio Seco in his immediate rear. But he had prepared\r\na new surprise for the enemy; as they descended upon him they were\r\nastonished to see his front line, the eight battalions which formed\r\nthe fourth Galician division, form itself into columns of attack and\r\nslowly commence to climb the hill with the object of attacking their\r\nright and centre. Meanwhile Cuesta’s handful of cavalry rode out on\r\nthe northern end of the line and fell upon the skirmishers of Mouton’s\r\ndivision, whom it chased back till it was met and driven off by the\r\nthree squadrons of the Imperial Guard.\r\n\r\nThe uphill charge of the fourth Galician division was a fine but an\r\nutterly useless display of courage. They were attacking nearly double\r\ntheir own numbers of victorious troops, who outflanked them on both\r\nwings and tore them to pieces with a concentric fire of artillery\r\nto which they could not respond. The regiments at each end of the\r\nline were soon broken up, but in the centre two battalions of picked\r\ngrenadiers[138] actually closed with the French, captured four guns\r\nof the Imperial Guard, and forced back the supporting infantry of the\r\nsame corps for a short space, till Bessières hurled upon them the three\r\nsquadrons of the Guard-Cavalry, which broke them and swept them down\r\nhill again.\r\n\r\n  [138] In accordance with the unwise practice prevailing in most\r\n  Continental armies, Blake had massed the grenadier companies of\r\n  all his line regiments into two battalions, to act as a select\r\n  reserve.\r\n\r\nSeeing his attack fail, Cuesta bade his last reserve, the raw Castilian\r\nand Leonese levies, retreat behind the river and the town of Medina de\r\nRio Seco, which they did without much loss, covered to a certain extent\r\nby the two Asturian battalions, the only part of Cuesta’s own force\r\nwhich was seriously engaged.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Army of Castile,’ therefore, had no more than 155 casualties, but\r\nthe two Galician divisions had suffered heavily. They left behind them\r\non the field nearly 400 dead, and over 500 wounded, with some 1,200\r\nprisoners. The ten guns of Blake’s wing had all been captured, and with\r\nthem several pairs of colours. In addition more than a thousand of the\r\nGalician recruits had dispersed, and could not be rallied. Altogether\r\nBlake’s army had lost over 3,000 men. The French, as might have been\r\nexpected, had suffered comparatively little: they had 105 killed and\r\n300 wounded, according to Foy; other historians give even smaller\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nA vigorous pursuit might have done much further harm to the defeated\r\nSpaniards; but Bessières’ men had been marching since two in the\r\nmorning, and fighting all through the mid-day. They were much fatigued,\r\nand their commander did not press the chase far beyond the river.\r\nBut the town of Rio Seco was sacked from cellar to garret, with much\r\nslaying of non-combatants and outrages of all kinds[139], a fact very\r\ndiscreditable to the marshal, who could have stopped the plunder had he\r\nchosen.\r\n\r\n  [139] When Stuart and Vaughan passed through Medina in September,\r\n  they were given many harrowing details by the local authorities.\r\n\r\nThe defeated generals met, a little to the west of the battle-field,\r\nand after a bitter altercation, in which Blake used the plainest words\r\nabout Cuesta’s generalship, parted in wrath. The Galicians retired by\r\nthe way they had come, and joined the division which had been left\r\nbehind three days before; they then went back to the passes above\r\nAstorga, abandoning a considerable amount of stores at Benavente.\r\nCuesta took the army of Castile to Leon, retiring on the Asturias\r\nrather than on Galicia.\r\n\r\nBessières’ well-earned victory was creditable to himself and his\r\ntroops, but the way had been made easy for him by the astounding\r\ntactical errors of the Captain-General of Castile. The rank and file of\r\nthe Spanish army had no reason to be ashamed of their conduct: it was\r\ntheir commander who should have blushed at the reckless way in which he\r\nhad sacrificed his willing troops. Handled by Cuesta the best army in\r\nthe world might have been defeated by inferior numbers.\r\n\r\nThe strategical results of the battle of Rio Seco were great and\r\nfar-reaching. All danger of the cutting of the communications between\r\nMadrid and Bayonne was averted, and Napoleon, his mind set at rest\r\non this point, could now assert that Dupont’s position in Andalusia\r\nwas henceforth the only hazardous point in his great scheme of\r\ninvasion[140]. It would clearly be a very long time before the army of\r\nGalicia would again dare to take the offensive, and meanwhile Madrid\r\nwas safe, and the attempt to conquer Southern Spain could be resumed\r\nwithout any fear of interruption. Bessières, after such a victory,\r\nwas strong enough not to require any further reinforcements from the\r\ncentral reserve in and about the capital.\r\n\r\n  [140] See his remarks in the document of July 21, _Nap.\r\n  Corresp._, 14,223.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious result of Rio Seco was that King Joseph was now able\r\nto proceed on his way to Madrid, and to enter the city in triumph.\r\nAfter receiving the homage of the Spanish notables at Bayonne, and\r\nnominating a ministry, he had crossed the frontier on July 9. But he\r\nhad been obliged to stop short at Burgos, till Bessières should have\r\nbeaten off the attack of Blake and Cuesta: his presence there had been\r\nmost inconvenient to the marshal, who had been forced to leave behind\r\nfor his protection Rey’s veteran brigade of Mouton’s division, which he\r\nwould gladly have taken out to the approaching battle.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of Medina de Rio Seco arrived at Burgos, the usurper\r\nresumed his march on Madrid, still escorted by Rey’s troops. He\r\ntravelled by short stages, stopping at every town to be complimented\r\nby reluctant magistrates and corporations, who dared not refuse\r\ntheir homage. The populace everywhere shut itself up in its houses\r\nin silent protest. Joseph’s state entry into Madrid on July 20 was\r\nthe culminating point of the melancholy farce. He passed through the\r\nstreets with a brilliant staff, between long lines of French bayonets,\r\nand amid the blare of military music. But not a Spaniard was to be seen\r\nexcept the handful of courtiers and officials who had accepted the new\r\ngovernment. The attempts of the French to produce a demonstration, or\r\neven to get the town decorated, had met with passive disobedience. Like\r\nCharles of Austria when he entered Madrid in 1710, Joseph Bonaparte\r\nmight have exclaimed that he could see ‘a court, but no people’ about\r\nhim. But he affected not to notice the dismal side of the situation,\r\nassumed an exaggerated urbanity, and heaped compliments and preferment\r\non the small section of _Afrancesados_ who adhered to him.\r\n\r\nThe usurper had resolved to give himself as much as possible the air\r\nof a Spanish national king. Of all his Neapolitan court he had brought\r\nwith him only one personage, his favourite Saligny, whom he had made\r\nDuke of San Germano. The rest of his household was composed of nobles\r\nand officials chosen from among the herd which had bowed before him at\r\nBayonne. There were among them several of the late partisans of King\r\nFerdinand, of whom some had frankly sold themselves to his supplanter,\r\nwhile others (like the Duke of Infantado) were only looking for an\r\nopportunity to abscond when it might present itself. The first list\r\nof ministers was also full of names that were already well known in\r\nthe Spanish bureaucracy. Of the cabinet of Ferdinand VII, Cevallos the\r\nminister of Foreign Affairs, O’Farrill at the War Office, Piñuela at\r\nthe ministry of Justice, were base enough to accept the continuation\r\nof their powers by the usurper. Urquijo, who took the Secretaryship of\r\nState, was an old victim of Godoy’s, who had once before held office\r\nunder Charles IV. Mazarredo, who was placed at the ministry of Marine,\r\nwas perhaps the most distinguished officer in the Spanish navy. But\r\nJoseph imagined that his greatest stroke of policy was the appointment\r\nas minister of the Interior of Gaspar de Jovellanos, the most prominent\r\namong the Spanish liberals, whose reputation for wisdom and patriotism\r\nhad cost him a long imprisonment during the days of the Prince of the\r\nPeace. The idea was ingenious, but the plan for strengthening the\r\nministry failed, for Jovellanos utterly refused to take office along\r\nwith a clique of traitors and in the cabinet of a usurper. Yet even\r\nwithout him, the body of courtiers and officials whom Joseph collected\r\nwas far more respectable, from their high station and old experience,\r\nthan might have been expected--a fact very disgraceful to the Spanish\r\nbureaucrats.\r\n\r\nIn less troublous times, and with a more legitimate title to the\r\ncrown, Joseph Bonaparte might have made a very tolerable king. He\r\nwas certainly a far more worthy occupant of the throne than any of\r\nthe miserable Spanish Bourbons: but he was not of the stuff of which\r\nsuccessful usurpers are made. He was a weak, well-intentioned man, not\r\ndestitute of a heart or a conscience: and as he gradually realized all\r\nthe evils that he had brought on Spain by his ill-regulated ambition,\r\nhe grew less and less satisfied with his position as his brother’s\r\ntool. He made long and untiring efforts to conciliate the Spaniards,\r\nby an unwavering affability and mildness, combined with a strict\r\nattention to public business. Unfortunately all his efforts were\r\ncounteracted by his brother’s harshness, and by the greed and violence\r\nof the French generals, over whom he could never gain any control. It\r\nis a great testimony in his favour that the Spanish people despised\r\nrather than hated him: their more violent animosity was reserved for\r\nNapoleon. His nominal subjects agreed to regard him as a humorous\r\ncharacter: they laughed at his long harangues, in which Neapolitan\r\nphrases were too often mixed with the sonorous Castilian: they insisted\r\nthat he was blind of one eye--which did not happen to be the case.\r\nThey spoke of him as always occupied with the pleasures of the table\r\nand with miscellaneous amours--accusations for which there was a very\r\nslight foundation of fact. They insisted that he was a coward and a\r\nsluggard--titles which he was far from meriting. He was, they said,\r\nperpetually hoodwinked, baffled, and bullied, alike by his generals,\r\nhis ministers, and his mistresses. But they never really hated him--a\r\nfact which, considering the manner of his accession, must be held to be\r\nvery much to his credit.\r\n\r\nBut the first stay of the ‘Intrusive King,’ as the Spaniards called\r\nhim, in his capital, was to be very short. He had only arrived there\r\non July 20: his formal proclamation took place on the twenty-fourth.\r\nHe had hardly settled down in the royal palace, and commenced a\r\ndispute with the effete ‘Council of Castile’--which with unexpected\r\nobstinacy refused to swear the oath to him and to the constitution of\r\nBayonne--when he was obliged to take to flight. On the twenty-fourth\r\nrumours began to be current in Madrid that a great disaster had taken\r\nplace in Andalusia, and that Dupont’s army had been annihilated. On the\r\ntwenty-eighth the news was confirmed in every particular. On August 1,\r\nthe King, the court, and the 20,000 French troops which still remained\r\nin and about the capital, marched out by the northern road, and took\r\ntheir way towards the Ebro. This retreat was the result of a great\r\ncouncil of war, in which the energetic advice of Savary, who wished to\r\nfight one more battle in front of the capital, with all the forces that\r\ncould be concentrated, was overruled by the King and the majority of\r\nthe generals. ‘A council of war never fights,’ as has been most truly\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III: CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDUPONT IN ANDALUSIA: THE CAPITULATION OF BAYLEN\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left General Dupont at Andujar, on the upper course of the\r\nGuadalquivir, whither he had retired on June 19 after evacuating\r\nCordova. Deeply troubled by the interruption of his communications\r\nwith Madrid, and by the growing strength displayed by the Spanish army\r\nin his front, he had resolved that it was necessary to draw back to\r\nthe foot of the Sierra Morena, and to recover at all costs his touch\r\nwith the main French army in the capital. He kept sending to Murat (or\r\nrather to Savary, who had now superseded the Grand-Duke) persistent\r\ndemands for new orders and for large reinforcements. Most of his\r\nmessengers were cut off on the way by the insurgents, but his situation\r\nhad become known at head quarters, and was engrossing much of Savary’s\r\nattention--more of it indeed than Napoleon approved. The Emperor wrote\r\non July 13 that the decisive point was for the moment in Castile, and\r\nnot in Andalusia, and that the best way to strengthen Dupont was to\r\nreinforce Bessières[141].\r\n\r\n  [141] See Foy (iv. 45), and _Nap. Corresp._, 14,192, where the\r\n  Emperor goes so far as to say: ‘Si le Général Dupont éprouvait\r\n  un échec, cela ait de peu de conséquence. Il n’aurait d’autre\r\n  résultat que de lui faire repasser les montagnes’ (i.e. the\r\n  Sierra Morena).\r\n\r\nSuch had not been Savary’s opinion: frightened at the isolation in\r\nwhich Dupont now lay, he sent to his assistance the second division\r\nof his corps, 6,000 men under General Vedel, all recruits of the\r\n‘legions of reserve,’ save one single battalion of Swiss troops. The\r\ndivision was accompanied by Boussard’s cavalry, the 6th Provisional\r\nDragoons, some 600 strong. Vedel made his way through La Mancha without\r\ndifficulty, but on entering the Despeña Perros defiles found his\r\npassage disputed by a body of insurgents--2,000 peasants with four\r\nantique cannon--who had stockaded themselves in the midst of the pass.\r\nA resolute attack scattered them in a few minutes, and on reaching La\r\nCarolina on the southern slope of the mountains Vedel got in touch\r\nwith Dupont, who had hitherto no notice of his approach [June 27].\r\n\r\nInstead of leaving the newly arrived division to guard the passes,\r\nDupont called it down to join him in the valley of the Guadalquivir.\r\nWith the assistance of Vedel’s troops he considered himself strong\r\nenough to make head against the Spanish army under Castaños, which was\r\ncommencing to draw near to Andujar. Keeping his original force at that\r\ntown--a great centre of roads, but a malarious spot whose hospitals\r\nwere already crowded with 600 sick,--he placed Vedel at Baylen, a\r\nplace sixteen miles further east, but still in the plain, though the\r\nfoot-hills of the Sierra Morena begin to rise just behind it. To\r\nassert himself and strike terror into the insurgents, Dupont ordered\r\none of Vedel’s brigades to make a forced march to Jaen, the capital\r\nof a province and a considerable focus of rebellion. This expedition\r\nscattered the local levies, took and sacked Jaen, and then returned in\r\nsafety to Baylen [July 2-3].\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Castaños was drawing near: he had now had a month in which to\r\norganize his army. Like Blake in Galicia, he had used the recruits of\r\nAndalusia to fill up the gaps in the depleted battalions of the regular\r\narmy. But less fortunate than his colleague in the north, he had not\r\nbeen able to prevent the Juntas of Seville and Granada from creating a\r\nnumber of new volunteer corps, and had been obliged to incorporate them\r\nin his field army, where they were a source of weakness rather than of\r\nstrength. His total force was some 33,000 or 34,000 men, of whom 2,600\r\nwere cavalry, for in this arm he was far better provided than was the\r\narmy of the North. The whole was organized in four divisions, under\r\nGenerals Reding, Coupigny, Felix Jones (an Irish officer, in spite of\r\nhis Welsh name), and La Peña. In addition there was a flying brigade of\r\nnew levies under Colonel Cruz-Murgeon, which was pushed forward along\r\nthe roots of the mountains, at a considerable distance in front of the\r\nmain body: it was ordered to harass Dupont’s northern flank and to cut\r\nhis communications with Baylen and La Carolina.\r\n\r\nWith 16,000 or 17,000 men, including nearly 3,500 cavalry, Dupont\r\nought to have been able to contain Castaños, if not to beat him.\r\nThe proportion of his forces to those of the enemy was not much\r\nless than that which Bessières had possessed at Medina de Rio Seco.\r\nBut, unfortunately for himself and his master, Dupont was far from\r\npossessing the boldness and the skill of the marshal. By assuming not\r\na vigorous offensive but a timid defensive along a protracted front,\r\nhe threw away his chances. The line which he had resolved to hold was\r\nthat of the Upper Guadalquivir, from Andujar to the next passage up\r\nthe river, the ferry of Mengibar, eight miles from Baylen. This gave a\r\nfront of some fifteen miles to hold: but unfortunately even when drawn\r\nout to this length the two divisions of Barbou and Vedel did not cover\r\nall the possible lines of attack which Castaños might adopt. He might\r\nstill march past them and cut them off from the defiles of the Morena,\r\nby going a little higher up the river and crossing it near Baeza and\r\nUbeda. Dupont was wrong to take this line of defence at all: unless he\r\nwas prepared to attack the army of Andalusia in the open, he should\r\nhave retired to Baylen or to La Carolina, where he would have been able\r\nto cover the passes for as long as he might choose, since he could not\r\nhave had either of his flanks turned.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he was gratified to hear that further reinforcements were\r\nbeing sent to him. Unreasonably disquieted about Andalusia, as Napoleon\r\nthought, Savary proceeded to send a third division to aid Dupont. This\r\nwas Gobert’s, the second of Moncey’s corps: it started from Madrid\r\nnot quite complete, and left strong detachments at the more important\r\ntowns along the road through La Mancha. Though originally seventeen\r\nbattalions strong, it reached the northern slope of the Sierra Morena\r\nwith only ten. Savary had not intended it to go any further: he had\r\ntold Dupont that it was to be used to cover his retreat, if a retreat\r\nbecame necessary, but not for active operations in Andalusia. But\r\ndisregarding these directions Dupont commanded Gobert to cross the\r\nMorena and come down to join Vedel: this he did, bringing with him\r\nnine ‘provisional battalions[142]’ and the second provisional regiment\r\nof cuirassiers, perhaps 5,000 men in all. There were now over 20,000\r\nFrench on the south side of the mountain, a force amply sufficient to\r\ndeal with Castaños and his 33,000 Andalusians [July 7]. But they were\r\nstill widely scattered. Dupont lay at Andujar with 9,000 or 10,000\r\nsabres and bayonets: Vedel was sixteen miles away at Baylen, with 6,000\r\nmen, of whom 2,000 under General Liger-Belair were pushed forward to\r\nthe ferry of Mengibar. Gobert was at La Carolina, at the foot of the\r\npasses, with five battalions about him, and a sixth encamped on the\r\nsummit of the defile. He had sent forward the remainder of his division\r\n(the four battalions of the sixth provisional regiment, and half the\r\nsecond provisional cuirassiers) to join Dupont at Andujar, so that he\r\nhad not more than 2,800 bayonets and 350 cavalry with him.\r\n\r\n  [142] Of Gobert’s division the 5th provisional regiment and\r\n  the Irish battalion never marched south. The 6th, 7th, and 8th\r\n  provisional regiments--twelve battalions--formed the column;\r\n  they left one battalion at Madridejos, another at Manzanares.\r\n  One more remained in the pass at the Puerto del Rey; nine and\r\n  the cuirassiers (700 strong) descended into the plains. See for\r\n  details Cabany’s _Baylen_, p. 115.\r\n\r\nCastaños, meanwhile, had brought up his whole army, with the exception\r\nof the flying corps of Cruz-Murgeon, to a line close in front of\r\nAndujar: the heads of his columns were at Arjona and Arjonilla, only\r\nfive miles from Dupont. On July 11 the Spanish generals held a council\r\nof war at Porcuña, and drew out their plan of operations. Since the\r\nenemy seemed to be still quiescent, they resolved to attack him in\r\nhis chosen position behind the river. Castaños, in person--with the\r\ndivisions of Jones and La Peña, 12,000 strong--undertook to keep\r\nDupont employed, by delivering an attack on Andujar, which he did not\r\nintend to press home unless he got good news from his second and third\r\ncolumns. Meanwhile, six miles up the river, Coupigny with the second\r\ndivision, nearly 8,000 strong, was to attempt to cross the Guadalquivir\r\nby the ford of Villa Nueva. Lastly, Reding with the first division, the\r\nbest and most numerous of the whole army, 10,000 strong, was to seize\r\nthe ferry of Mengibar and march on Baylen. Here he was to be joined by\r\nCoupigny, and the two corps were then to fall upon the rear of Dupont’s\r\nposition at Andujar, while Castaños was besetting it in front. It was\r\ntheir aim to surround and capture the whole of the French division,\r\nif its general did not move away before the encircling movement was\r\ncomplete. Meanwhile the flying column of Cruz-Murgeon, about 3,000\r\nstrong, was to cross the Guadalquivir below Andujar, throw itself into\r\nthe mountains in the north, and join hands with Reding and Coupigny\r\nbehind the back of Dupont.\r\n\r\nThis plan, though ultimately crowned with success, was perilous in the\r\nhighest degree. But Castaños had seriously underestimated the total\r\nforce of Dupont, as well as misconceived his exact position. He was\r\nunder the impression that the main body of the French, which he did\r\nnot calculate at more than 12,000 or 14,000 men, was concentrated at\r\nAndujar, and that there were nothing more than weak detachments at\r\nMengibar, Baylen, or La Carolina. These, he imagined, could not stand\r\nbefore Reding, and when the latter had once got to the northern bank of\r\nthe river, he would easily clear the way for Coupigny to cross. But as\r\na matter of fact Vedel had 6,000 men at Mengibar and Baylen, with 3,000\r\nmore under Gobert within a short march of him. If the Spanish plan had\r\nbeen punctually carried out, Reding should have suffered a severe check\r\nat the hands of these two divisions, while Dupont could easily have\r\ndealt with Castaños at Andujar. Coupigny, if he got across at Villa\r\nNueva, while the divisions on each side of him were beaten off, would\r\nhave been in a very compromised position, and could not have dared to\r\npush forward. But in this curious campaign the probable never happened,\r\nand everything went in the most unforeseen fashion.\r\n\r\nOn July 13 the Spanish plan began to be carried out, Reding marching\r\nfor Mengibar and Coupigny for Villa Nueva. Castaños kept quiet at\r\nArjonilla, till his lieutenants should have reached the points which\r\nthey were to attack. On the same day Dupont received the news of\r\nMoncey’s repulse before Valencia, and made up his mind that he must\r\npersevere in his defensive attitude, without making any attempt to\r\nmass his troops and fall upon the enemy in his front[143]. Just at\r\nthe moment when his enemies were putting the game into his hands, by\r\ndividing themselves into three columns separated from each other by\r\nconsiderable gaps, he relinquished every intention of taking advantage\r\nof their fault.\r\n\r\n  [143] Dupont considered that Savary’s intention was to stop\r\n  all offensive movements whatever: ‘Le général-en-chef me fait\r\n  entrevoir que nous aurons peut-être à garder notre position\r\n  jusqu’à ce que Valence et Saragosse soient soumises’ (Dupont to\r\n  Vedel, July 13).\r\n\r\nOn July 14 Reding appeared in front of the ferry of Mengibar, and\r\npushed back beyond the river the outlying pickets of Liger-Belair’s\r\ndetachment. He made no further attempt to press the French, but Dupont,\r\ndisquieted about an attack on this point, ordered Gobert to bring down\r\nthe remains of his division to Baylen, to join Vedel. Next morning\r\nthe Spaniards began to develop their whole plan: Castaños appeared\r\non a long front opposite Andujar, and made a great demonstration\r\nagainst the position of Dupont, using all his artillery and showing\r\nheads of columns at several points. Coupigny came down to the river\r\nat Villa Nueva, and got engaged with a detachment which was sent\r\nout from Andujar to hold the ford. Reding, making a serious attempt\r\nto push forward, crossed the Guadalquivir at Mengibar and attacked\r\nLiger-Belair. But Vedel came up to the support of his lieutenant, and\r\nwhen the Swiss general found, quite contrary to his expectation, a\r\nwhole division deployed against him, he ceased to press his advance,\r\nand retired once more beyond the river.\r\n\r\nNothing decisive had yet happened: but the next day was to be far more\r\nimportant. The operations opened with two gross faults made by the\r\nFrench: Dupont had been so much impressed with the demonstration made\r\nagainst him by Castaños, that he judged himself hopelessly outnumbered\r\nat Andujar, and sent to Vedel for reinforcements. He bade him send a\r\nbattalion or two, or even a whole brigade, if the force that he had\r\nfought at Mengibar seemed weak and unenterprising[144]. This was an\r\nerror, for Castaños only outnumbered the French at Andujar by two or\r\nthree thousand men, and was not really to be feared. But Vedel made a\r\nworse slip: despising Reding overmuch, he marched on Baylen, not with\r\none brigade, but with his whole division, save the original detachment\r\nof two battalions under Liger-Belair which remained to watch Mengibar.\r\nStarting at midnight, he reached Andujar at two on the afternoon of\r\nthe sixteenth, to find that Castaños had done no more than repeat his\r\ndemonstration of the previous day, and had been easily held back.\r\nCruz-Murgeon’s levies, which the Spanish general had pushed over the\r\nriver below Andujar, had received a sharp repulse when they tried to\r\nmolest Dupont’s flank. Coupigny had made an even feebler show than his\r\nchief at the ford of Villa Nueva, and had not passed the Guadalquivir.\r\n\r\n  [144] Dupont to Vedel, evening of July 15.\r\n\r\nBut Reding, on the morning of the sixteenth, had woken up to unexpected\r\nvigour. He had forded the river near Mengibar, and fallen on\r\nLiger-Belair’s detachment for the second time. Hard pressed, the French\r\nbrigadier had sent for succour to Baylen, whither Gobert had moved down\r\nwhen Vedel marched for Andujar. The newly arrived general came quickly\r\nto the aid of the compromised detachment, but he was very weak, for he\r\nhad left a battalion at La Carolina and sent another with a squadron\r\nof cuirassiers to Liñares, to guard against a rumoured movement of\r\nthe Spaniards along the Upper Guadalquivir. He only brought with him\r\nthree battalions and 200 cavalry, and this was not enough to contain\r\nReding. The 4,000 men of the two French detachments were outnumbered\r\nby more than two to one; they suffered a thorough defeat, and Gobert\r\nwas mortally wounded. His brigadier, Dufour, who took over the command,\r\nfell back on Baylen, eight miles to the rear. Next morning, though not\r\npressed by Reding, he retired towards La Carolina, to prevent himself\r\nbeing cut off from the passes, for he credited a false rumour that the\r\nSpaniards were detaching troops by way of Liñares to seize the Despeña\r\nPerros.\r\n\r\nDupont heard of Gobert’s defeat on the evening of the sixteenth. It\r\nderanged all his plans, for it showed him that the enemy were not\r\nmassed in front of Andujar, as he supposed, but had a large force\r\nfar up the river. Two courses were open to him--either to march on\r\nBaylen with his whole army in order to attack Reding, and to reopen\r\nthe communications with La Carolina and the passes, or to fall upon\r\nCastaños and the troops in his immediate front. An enterprising officer\r\nwould probably have taken the latter alternative, and could not have\r\nfailed of success, for the whole French army in Andalusia save the\r\ntroops of Belair and Dufour was now concentrated at Andujar, and not\r\nless than 15,000 bayonets and 3,000 sabres were available for an attack\r\non Castaños’ 12,000 men[145]. Even if Coupigny joined his chief, the\r\nFrench would have almost an equality in numbers and a great superiority\r\nin cavalry and guns. There cannot be the slightest doubt that the\r\nSpaniards would have suffered a defeat, and then it would have been\r\npossible to expel Reding from Baylen without any danger of interference\r\nfrom other quarters.\r\n\r\n  [145] Dupont’s available force at this moment consisted of the\r\n  following troops. The numbers given are their original strength,\r\n  from which deductions must of course be made:--\r\n\r\n  Infantry--Barbou’s Division:\r\n\r\n  Chabert’s    { 4th Legion of Reserve (three batts.)              3,084\r\n  Brigade      { 4th Swiss Regiment (one batt.)                      709\r\n               { Marines of the Guard (one batt.)                    532\r\n\r\n  Pannetier’s  { 3rd Legion of Reserve (two batts.)                2,057\r\n  Brigade      { Garde de Paris (two batts.)                       1,454\r\n\r\n  Schramm’s    } Swiss regiments of Reding and Preux (four batts.) 2,000\r\n  Brigade      }\r\n\r\n    Vedel’s Division:\r\n\r\n  Poinsot’s    { 5th Legion of Reserve (three batts.)              2,695\r\n  Brigade      { 3rd Swiss Regiment                                1,174\r\n\r\n  Cassagnes’   { 1st Legion of Reserve (one batt.)

(36 guns)                                           900\r\n                                                                  ------\r\n                                                                  21,058\r\n\r\n  Allowing a deduction of 3,000 men for sick and previous losses,\r\n  there remain 15,000 bayonets and 3,000 sabres.\r\n\r\nBut, in a moment of evil inspiration, Dupont chose to deprive himself\r\nof the advantage of having practically his whole army concentrated\r\non one spot, and determined to copy the error of the Spaniards by\r\nsplitting his force into two equal halves. He resolved to retain his\r\ndefensive position in front of Andujar, and to keep there his original\r\nforce--Barbou’s infantry and Frésia’s horse. But Vedel with his own\r\nmen, the four battalions from Gobert’s division which were at Andujar,\r\nand 600 cavalry, was sent off to Baylen, where he was directed to rally\r\nthe beaten troops of Dufour and Liger-Belair, and then to fall upon\r\nReding and chase him back beyond the Guadalquivir[146].\r\n\r\n  [146] ‘Je vous prie, mon cher général, de vous porter le plus\r\n  rapidement possible, sur Baylen, pour y faire votre jonction avec\r\n  le corps qui a combattu aujourd’hui à Mengibar, et qui s’est\r\n  replié sur cette ville.... J’espère que demain l’ennemi sera\r\n  rejeté sur Mengibar, au delà du fleuve, et que les postes de\r\n  Guarroman et de la Caroline resteront en sûreté; ils sont d’une\r\n  grande importance’ (Dupont to Vedel, night of July 16). In these\r\n  orders lies the foundation of the disaster.\r\n\r\nOn the morning, therefore, of July 17 Vedel set out with some 6,000\r\nmen and marched to Baylen. Arriving there he found that Dufour had\r\nevacuated the place, and had hurried on to La Carolina, on the false\r\nhypothesis that Reding had pushed past him to seize the passes. As a\r\nmatter of fact the Spaniard had done nothing of the kind: after his\r\nsuccess at Mengibar, he had simply retired to his camp by the river,\r\nand given his men twenty-four hours’ rest. It was a strange way to\r\nemploy the day after a victory--but his quiescence chanced to have the\r\nmost fortunate effect. Vedel, on hearing that Dufour had hastened\r\naway to defend La Carolina and the passes, resolved to follow him.\r\nHe was so inexcusably negligent that he did not even send a cavalry\r\nreconnaissance towards Mengibar, to find out whether any Spanish force\r\nremained there. Had he done so, he would have found Reding’s whole\r\ndivision enjoying their well-earned siesta! In the direction of La\r\nCarolina and the passes there was no enemy save a small flanking column\r\nof 1,800 raw levies under the Count of Valdecañas, which lay somewhere\r\nnear Liñares.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Battle of Baylen July 19, 1808, at the moment of\r\n    Dupont’s third attack.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Part of Andalusia, between Andujar and the Passes.\r\n    July 19, 1808.]\r\n\r\nOn the night of the seventeenth, Vedel and his men, tired out by a long\r\nmarch of over twenty miles, slept at Guarroman, halfway between Baylen\r\nand La Carolina. Dufour and Liger-Belair had reached the last-named\r\nplace and Santa Elena, and had found no Spaniards near them. On the\r\nmorning of the eighteenth Vedel followed them, and united his troops\r\nto theirs. He had then some 10,000 or 11,000 men concentrated in and\r\nabout La Carolina, with one single battalion left at Guarroman to keep\r\nup his touch with Dupont. The latter had been entirely deceived by the\r\nfalse news which Vedel had sent him from Baylen--to the effect that\r\nReding and his corps had marched for the passes, in order to cut the\r\nFrench communications with Madrid. Believing the story, he forwarded\r\nto his subordinate an approval of his disastrous movement[147], and\r\nbade him ‘instantly attack and crush the Spanish force before him, and\r\nafter disposing of it return as quickly as possible to Andujar, to deal\r\nwith the troops of the enemy in that direction.’ Unfortunately, as we\r\nhave seen, there was no Spanish corps at all in front of Vedel; but by\r\nthe time that he discovered the fact it was too late for him to rejoin\r\nDupont without a battle[148]. His troops were tired out with two\r\nnight marches: there were no supplies of food to be got anywhere but at\r\nLa Carolina, and he decided that he must halt for at least twelve hours\r\nbefore returning to join Dupont.\r\n\r\n  [147] ‘J’ai reçu votre lettre de Baylen. D’après le mouvement\r\n  de l’ennemi, le général Dufour a très-bien fait de regagner de\r\n  vitesse sur La Caroline et sur Ste-Hélène, pour occuper la tête\r\n  des gorges. Je vois avec plaisir que vous vous hâtez de vous\r\n  réunir à lui, afin de combattre avec avantage.... Si vous trouvez\r\n  l’ennemi à La Caroline ou sur tout autre point, tâchez de le\r\n  battre, pour venir me rejoindre et repousser ce qui est devant\r\n  Andujar’ (Dupont to Vedel, night of July 17).\r\n\r\n  [148] Vedel had now with him the following troops:--\r\n\r\n  (1) His own whole division [he had rallied the two detached\r\n        battalions of Liger-Belair]                                6,800\r\n\r\n  (2) Nine battalions of Gobert’s division (four from Baylen,\r\n        three which had fought at Mengibar under Dufour, two\r\n        from Liñares and La Carolina)                              4,350\r\n\r\n  (3) Cavalry { 6th Provisional Dragoons                             620\r\n              { Half 2nd Provisional Cuirassiers                     340\r\n\r\n      Artillery, &c. (18 guns)                                       500\r\n                                                                  ------\r\n                                                                  12,610\r\n\r\n  Deduct 2,500 for losses in action at Mengibar and sick, and about\r\n  10,000 remain.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the morning of the eighteenth, Reding’s 9,500 men, of\r\nwhom 750 were cavalry, had been joined by Coupigny and the second\r\nAndalusian division, which amounted to 7,300 foot and 500 horse.\r\nAdvancing from Mengibar to attack Baylen, they found to their surprise\r\nthat the place was unoccupied: Vedel’s rearguard had left it on the\r\nprevious afternoon. Reding intended to march on Andujar from the rear\r\non the next day, being under the full belief that Vedel was still with\r\nDupont, and that the troops which had retired on La Carolina were only\r\nthe fragments of Gobert’s force. For Castaños and his colleagues had\r\ndrawn up their plan of operations on the hypothesis that the enemy were\r\nstill concentrated at Andujar.\r\n\r\nReding therefore, with some 17,000 men, encamped in and about Baylen,\r\nintending to start at daybreak on July 19, and to fall on Dupont from\r\nbehind, while his chief assailed him in front. But already before\r\nthe sun was up, musket-shots from his pickets to the west announced\r\nthat the French were approaching from that direction. It was with the\r\nhead and not with the rear of Dupont’s column that Castaños’ first\r\nand second divisions were to be engaged, for the enemy had evacuated\r\nAndujar, and was in full march for Baylen.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the seventeenth Dupont had received the news that Vedel\r\nhad evacuated Baylen and gone off to the north-east, so that a gap of\r\nthirty miles or more now separated him from his lieutenant. He had\r\nat first been pleased with the move, as we have seen: but presently\r\nhe gathered, from the fact that Castaños did not press him, but only\r\nassailed him with a distant and ineffective cannonade, that the main\r\nstress of the campaign was not at Andujar but elsewhere. The Spanish\r\narmy was shifting itself eastward, and he therefore resolved that\r\nhe must do the same, though he would have to abandon his cherished\r\noffensive position, his entrenchments, and such part of his supplies as\r\nhe could not carry with him. Having made up his mind to depart, Dupont\r\nwould have done wisely to start at once: if he had gone off early on\r\nthe morning of the eighteenth, he would have found Reding and Coupigny\r\nnot established in position at Baylen, but only just approaching from\r\nthe south. Probably he might have brushed by their front, or even have\r\ngiven them a serious check, if he had fallen on them without hesitation.\r\n\r\nBut two considerations induced the French general to wait for the\r\ndarkness, and to waste fourteen invaluable hours at Andujar. The first\r\nwas that he hoped by moving at night to escape the notice of Castaños,\r\nwho might have attacked him if his retreat was open and undisguised.\r\nThe second was that he wished to carry off his heavy baggage train:\r\nnot only had he between 600 and 800 sick to load on his wagons, but\r\nthere was an enormous mass of other impedimenta, mainly consisting of\r\nthe plunder of Cordova. French and Spanish witnesses unite in stating\r\nthat the interminable file of 500 vehicles which clogged Dupont’s march\r\nwas to a very great extent laden with stolen goods[149]. And it was\r\nthe officers rather than the men who were responsible for this mass of\r\nslow-moving transport.\r\n\r\n  [149] Against Cabany’s defence of Dupont on this point there\r\n  must be set the impression of almost every French witness from\r\n  Napoleon downwards.\r\n\r\nIt was not therefore till nine in the evening of the eighteenth that\r\nthe French general thought fit to move. After barricading and blocking\r\nup the bridge of Andujar--he dared not use gunpowder to destroy it for\r\nfear of rousing Castaños--he started on his night march. He had with\r\nhim thirteen battalions of infantry and four and a half regiments of\r\ncavalry, with twenty-four guns, in all about 8,500 foot soldiers and\r\n2,500 horse, allowing for the losses which he had sustained in sick\r\nand wounded during the earlier phases of the campaign[150]. His march\r\nwas arranged as follows:--Chabert’s infantry brigade led the van:\r\nthen came the great convoy: behind it were the four Swiss battalions\r\nunder Colonel Schramm, which had lately been incorporated with the\r\nFrench army. These again were followed by Pannetier’s infantry brigade\r\nand Dupré’s two regiments of _chasseurs à cheval_. The rearguard\r\nfollowed at some distance: it was composed of two and a half regiments\r\nof heavy cavalry, placed under the command of General Privé, with\r\nthe one veteran infantry battalion which the army possessed, the 500\r\nMarines of the Guard, as also six _compagnies d’élite_ picked from\r\nthe ‘legions of reserve.’ From the fact that Dupont placed his best\r\ntroops in this quarter, it is evident that he expected to be fighting\r\na rearguard action, with Castaños in pursuit, rather than to come\r\ninto contact with Spanish troops drawn up across his line of march.\r\nHe was ignorant that Reding and Coupigny had occupied Baylen on the\r\nprevious day--a fact which speaks badly for his cavalry: with 2,500\r\nhorsemen about him, he ought to have known all that was going on in his\r\nneighbourhood. Probably the provisional regiments, which formed his\r\nwhole mounted force, were incapable of good work in the way of scouting\r\nand reconnaissances.\r\n\r\n  [150] Of the troops which we have recapitulated on page 182 there\r\n  still remained with Dupont the whole of Barbou’s infantry, four\r\n  of the five regiments of Frésia’s cavalry (the fifth had marched\r\n  with Vedel), half of the 2nd Provisional Cuirassiers, and the\r\n  two Swiss regiments of Reding and Preux. The original total of\r\n  these corps had been 13,274. There remained about 11,000, for\r\n  that number can be accounted for after the battle. The official\r\n  Spanish dispatch gave 8,242 unwounded prisoners and 2,000\r\n  casualties.\r\n\r\nThe little town of Baylen is situated in a slight depression of a\r\nsaddle-backed range of hills which runs southward out from the Sierra\r\nMorena. The road which leads through it passes over the lowest point in\r\nthe watershed, as is but natural: to the north and south of the town\r\nthe heights are better marked: they project somewhat on each flank, so\r\nthat the place is situated in a sort of amphitheatre. The hill to the\r\nsouth of Baylen is called the Cerrajon: those to the north the Cerro\r\ndel Zumacar Chico, and the Cerro del Zumacar Grande. All three are bare\r\nand bald, without a shrub or tree: none of them are steep, their lower\r\nslopes are quite suitable for cavalry work, and even their rounded\r\nsummits are not inaccessible to a horseman. The ground to the west of\r\nthem, over which the French had to advance, is open and level for a\r\nmile and a half: then it grows more irregular, and is thickly covered\r\nwith olive groves and other vegetation, so that a force advancing over\r\nit is hidden from the view of a spectator on the hills above Baylen\r\ntill it comes out into the open. The wooded ground is about two and\r\na half miles broad: its western limit is the ravine of a mountain\r\ntorrent, the Rumblar (or Herrumblar, as the aspirate-loving Andalusians\r\nsometimes call it). The road from Andujar to Baylen crosses this\r\nstream by a bridge, the only place where artillery can pass the rocky\r\nbut not very deep depression.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to say a few words about the ground eastward from\r\nBaylen, as this too was not unimportant in the later phases of the\r\nbattle. Here the road passes through a broad defile rather than a\r\nplain. It is entirely commanded by the heights on its northern side,\r\nwhere lies the highest ground of the neighbourhood, the Cerro de San\r\nCristobal, crowned by a ruined hermitage. The difference between the\r\napproach to Baylen from the west and from the east, is that on the\r\nformer side the traveller reaches the town through a semicircular\r\namphitheatre of upland, while by the latter he comes up a V-shaped\r\nvalley cut through the hills.\r\n\r\nReding and Coupigny were somewhat surprised by the bicker of musketry\r\nwhich told them that the French had fallen upon their outposts. But\r\nfortunately for them their troops were already getting under arms,\r\nand were bivouacking over the lower slopes of the hills in a position\r\nwhich made it possible to extemporize without much difficulty a line\r\nof battle, covering the main road and the approaches to Baylen. They\r\nhastily occupied the low amphitheatre of hills north and south of the\r\ntown. Reding deployed to the right of the road, on the heights of the\r\nCerro del Zumacar Chico, Coupigny to its left on the Cerrajon. Their\r\nforce was of a very composite sort--seventeen battalions of regulars,\r\nsix of embodied militia, five of new Andalusian levies. The units\r\nvaried hopelessly in size, some having as few as 350 men, others as\r\nmany as 1,000. They could also dispose of 1,200 cavalry and sixteen\r\nguns. The greater part of the latter were placed in battery on the\r\ncentral and lowest part of the position, north and south of the high\r\nroad and not far in front of Baylen. The infantry formed a semicircular\r\ndouble line: in front were deployed battalions near the foot of the\r\namphitheatre of hills; in rear, higher up the slope or concealed behind\r\nthe crest, was a second line in columns of battalions. The cavalry were\r\ndrawn up still further to the rear. Finally, as a necessary precaution\r\nagainst the possible arrival of Vedel on the scene from La Carolina,\r\nReding placed seven battalions far away to the east, on the other side\r\nof Baylen, with cavalry pickets out in front to give timely notice of\r\nany signs of the enemy in this quarter. These 3,500 men were quite out\r\nof the battle as long as Dupont was the only enemy in sight.\r\n\r\nBefore it was fully daylight General Chabert and his brigade had thrust\r\nback the Spanish outposts. But the strength of the insurgent army was\r\nquite unknown to him: the morning dusk still lay in the folds of the\r\nhills, and he thought that he might possibly have in front of him\r\nnothing but some flying column of insignificant strength. Accordingly,\r\nafter allowing the whole of his brigade to come up, Chabert formed a\r\nsmall line of attack, brought up his battery along the high road to the\r\nmiddle of the amphitheatre, between the horns of the Spanish position,\r\nand made a vigorous push forward. He operated almost entirely to the\r\nsouth of the road, where, opposite Coupigny’s division, the hill was\r\nlower and the slope gentler than further north.\r\n\r\nTo dislodge 14,000 men and twenty guns in position with 3,000 men\r\nand six guns was of course a military impossibility. But Chabert had\r\nthe excuse that he did not, and could not, know what he was doing.\r\nHis attempt was of course doomed to failure: his battery was blown\r\nto pieces by the Spanish guns, acting from a concentric position,\r\nthe moment that it opened. His four battalions, after pushing back\r\nCoupigny’s skirmishing line for a few hundred yards, were presently\r\nchecked by the reserves which the Spaniard sent forward. Having come to\r\na stand they soon had to retire, and with heavy loss. The brigade drew\r\nback to the cover of the olive groves behind it, leaving two dismounted\r\nguns out in the open.\r\n\r\nBehind Chabert the enormous convoy was blocking the way as far back as\r\nthe bridge of the Rumblar. Five hundred wagons with their two or four\r\noxen apiece, took up, when strung along the road, more than two and a\r\nhalf miles. Dupont, who rode up at the sound of the cannon, and now\r\nclearly saw the Spanish line drawn up on a front of two miles north and\r\nsouth of the road, realized that this was no skirmish but a pitched\r\nbattle. His action was governed by the fact that he every moment\r\nexpected to hear the guns of Castaños thundering behind him, and to\r\nfind that he was attacked in rear as well as in front. He accordingly\r\nresolved to deliver a second assault as quickly as possible, before\r\nthis evil chance might come upon him. With some difficulty the Swiss\r\nbattalions, Dupré’s brigade of light cavalry, and Privé’s dragoons\r\npushed their way past the convoy and got into the open. They were\r\nterribly tired, having marched all night and covered fifteen miles\r\nof bad road, but their general threw them at once into the fight:\r\nPannetier’s brigade and the Marines of the Guard were still far to the\r\nrear, at or near the bridge of the Rumblar.\r\n\r\nDupont’s second attack was a fearful mistake: he should at all costs\r\nhave concentrated his whole army for one desperate stroke, for there\r\nwas no more chance that 6,000 men could break the Spanish line than\r\nthere had been that Chabert’s 3,000 could do so. But without waiting\r\nfor Pannetier to come up, he delivered his second attack. The four\r\nSwiss battalions advanced to the north of the road, Chabert’s rallied\r\nbrigade to the south of it: to the right of the latter were Privé’s\r\nheavy cavalry, two and a half regiments strong, with whom Dupont\r\nintended to deliver his main blow. They charged with admirable vigour\r\nand precision, cut up two Spanish battalions which failed to form\r\nsquare in time, and cleared the summit of the Cerrajon. But when,\r\ndisordered with their first success, they rode up against Coupigny’s\r\nreserves, they failed to break through. Their own infantry was too far\r\nto the rear to help them, and after a gallant struggle to hold their\r\nground, the dragoons and cuirassiers fell back to their old position.\r\nWhen they were already checked, Chabert and Schramm pushed forward to\r\ntry their fortune: beaten off by the central battery of the Spanish\r\nline and its infantry supports, they recoiled to the edge of the olive\r\nwood, and there reformed.\r\n\r\nThe French were now growing disheartened, and Dupont saw disaster\r\nimpending over him so closely that he seems to have lost his head, and\r\nto have retained no other idea save that of hurling every man that he\r\ncould bring up in fruitless attacks on the Spanish centre. He hurried\r\nup from the rear Pannetier’s brigade of infantry, leaving at the bridge\r\nof the Rumblar only the single battalion of the Marines of the Guard.\r\nAt eight o’clock the reinforcements had come up, and the attack was\r\nrenewed. This time the main stress was at the northern end of the line,\r\nwhere Pannetier was thrown forward, with orders to drive Reding’s right\r\nwing off the Cerro del Zumacar Grande, while the other battalions\r\nrenewed their assault against the Spanish centre and left. But the\r\nexhausted troops on the right of the line, who had been fighting since\r\ndaybreak, made little impression on Coupigny’s front, and Reding’s\r\nlast reserves were brought forward to check and hold off the one fresh\r\nbrigade of which Dupont could dispose.\r\n\r\nThe fourth attack had failed. The French general had now but one intact\r\nbattalion, that of the Marines of the Guard, which had been left with\r\nthe baggage at the bridge over the Rumblar, to protect the rear against\r\nthe possible advent of Castaños. As there were still no signs of an\r\nattack from that side, Dupont brought up this corps, ranged it across\r\nthe road in the centre of the line, and drew up behind it all that\r\ncould be rallied of Chabert’s and Pannetier’s men. The whole formed a\r\nsort of wedge, with which he hoped to break through the Spanish centre\r\nby one last effort. The cavalry advanced on the flanks, Privé’s brigade\r\nto the south, Dupré’s to the north of the road. Dupont himself, with\r\nall his staff around him, placed himself at the head of the marines,\r\nand rode in front of the line, waving his sword and calling to the men\r\nthat this time they must cut their way through [12.30 P.M.].\r\n\r\nAll was in vain: the attack was pressed home, the marines pushed up to\r\nthe very muzzles of the Spanish cannon placed across the high road, and\r\nDupré’s chasseurs drove in two battalions in Reding’s right centre.\r\nBut the column could get no further forward: the marines were almost\r\nexterminated: Dupré was shot dead: Dupont received a painful (but not\r\ndangerous) wound in the hip, and rode to the rear. Then the whole\r\nattack collapsed, and the French rolled back in utter disorder to the\r\nolive groves which sheltered their rear. The majority of the rank and\r\nfile of the two Swiss regiments in the centre threw up the butts of\r\ntheir muskets in the air and surrendered--or rather deserted--to the\r\nenemy[151].\r\n\r\n  [151] That the desertion was pretty general is shown by the\r\n  fact that of 2,000 men of these corps only 308 were recorded as\r\n  prisoners in the Spanish official returns. If 300 more had been\r\n  killed and wounded, 1,400 must have deserted. Hardly any officers\r\n  were among those who went over to the enemy; Schramm, their\r\n  commander, was wounded.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, just as the firing died down at the front, a lively\r\nfusillade was heard from another quarter. Cruz-Murgeon’s light column,\r\nfrom the side of the mountains, had come down upon the Rumblar bridge,\r\nand had begun to attack the small baggage-guard[152] which remained\r\nwith the convoy. All was up. Cruz-Murgeon was the forerunner of La\r\nPeña, and Dupont had not a man left to send to protect his rear. The\r\nbattalions were all broken up, the wearied infantry had cast themselves\r\ndown in the shade of the olive groves, and could not be induced even to\r\nrise to their feet. Most of them were gasping for water, which could\r\nnot be got, for the stream-beds which cross the field were all dried\r\nup, and only at the Rumblar could a drink be obtained. Not 2,000 men\r\nout of the original 11,000 who had started from Andujar could be got\r\ntogether to oppose a feeble front to Reding and Coupigny. It was only\r\nby keeping up a slow artillery fire, from the few pieces that had not\r\nbeen silenced or dismounted, that any show of resistance could be made.\r\nWhen the attack from the rear, which was obviously impending, should be\r\ndelivered, the whole force must clearly be destroyed.\r\n\r\n  [152] Three companies of Pannetier’s brigade.\r\n\r\nWishing at least to get some sort of terms for the men whom he had\r\nled into such a desperate position, Dupont at two o’clock sent his\r\naide-de-camp, Captain Villoutreys, one of the Emperor’s equerries, to\r\nask for a suspension of hostilities from Reding. He offered to evacuate\r\nAndalusia, not only with his own troops but with those of Vedel and\r\nDufour, in return for a free passage to Madrid. This was asking too\r\nmuch, and if the Spanish general had been aware of the desperate state\r\nof his adversary, he would not have listened to the proposal for a\r\nminute. But he did not know that La Peña was now close in Dupont’s\r\nrear, while he was fully aware that Vedel, returning too late from the\r\npasses, was now drawing near to the field from the north. His men were\r\nalmost as exhausted as those of Dupont, many had died from sunstroke in\r\nthe ranks, and he did not refuse to negotiate. He merely replied that\r\nhe had no power to treat, and that all communications should be made\r\nto his chief, who must be somewhere in the direction of Andujar. He\r\nwould grant a suspension of arms for a few hours, while a French and a\r\nSpanish officer should ride off together to seek for Castaños.\r\n\r\nDupont accepted these terms gladly, all the more so because La Peña’s\r\ndivision had at last reached the Rumblar bridge, and had announced its\r\napproach by four cannon-shots, fired at regular intervals, as a signal\r\nto catch Reding’s ear. It was with the greatest difficulty that the\r\ncommander of the fourth Andalusian division could be got to recognize\r\nthe armistice granted by his colleague; he saw the French at his\r\nmercy, and wanted to fall upon them while they were still in disorder.\r\nBut after some argument he consented to halt. Captain Villoutreys,\r\naccompanied by the Spanish Colonel Copons, rode through his lines to\r\nlook for Castaños.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish commander-in-chief had displayed most blameworthy torpidity\r\non this day. He had let Dupont slip away from Andujar, and did not\r\ndiscover that he was gone till dawn had arrived. Then, instead of\r\npursuing at full speed with all his forces, he had sent on La Peña’s\r\ndivision, while he lingered behind with that of Felix Jones, surveying\r\nthe enemy’s empty lines. The fourth division must have marched late\r\nand moved slowly, as it only reached the Rumblar bridge--twelve miles\r\nfrom Andujar--at about 2 p.m. It could easily have been there by 8 or 9\r\na.m., and might have fallen upon Dupont while he was delivering one of\r\nhis earlier attacks on the Baylen position.\r\n\r\nAt much the same moment that Villoutreys and Copons reached Castaños\r\nat Andujar, at about five o’clock in the afternoon, the second half\r\nof the French army at last appeared upon the scene. General Vedel had\r\ndiscovered on the eighteenth that he had nothing to fear from the side\r\nof the passes. He therefore called down all Dufour’s troops, save\r\ntwo battalions left at Santa Elena, united the two divisions at La\r\nCarolina, and gave orders for their return to Baylen on the following\r\nmorning. Leaving the bivouac at five o’clock Vedel, with some 9,000 or\r\n9,500 men, marched down the defile for ten miles as far as the village\r\nof Guarroman, which he reached about 9.30 or 10 a.m.[153] The day was\r\nhot, the men were tired, and though the noise of a distant cannonade\r\ncould be distinctly heard in the direction of Baylen, the general told\r\nhis officers to allow their battalions two hours to cook, and to rest\r\nthemselves. By some inexplicable carelessness the two hours swelled to\r\nfour, and it was not till 2 p.m. that the column started out again, to\r\ndrop down to Baylen. An hour before the French marched, the cannonade,\r\nwhich had been growling in the distance all through the mid-day rest,\r\nsuddenly died down. Vedel was in nowise disturbed, and is said to have\r\nremarked that his chief had probably made an end of the Spanish corps\r\nwhich had been blocking the road between them.\r\n\r\n  [153] There is some dispute as to the exact hours of Vedel’s\r\n  start and halt: I have adopted, more or less, those given by\r\n  Cabany. Vedel himself, when examined by the court-martial, said\r\n  ‘qu’il ne pouvait pas préciser l’heure,’ which is quite in\r\n  keeping with the rest of his doings.\r\n\r\nAfter this astonishing display of sloth and slackness, Vedel proceeded\r\nalong the road for ten miles, till he came in sight of the rear of the\r\nSpanish position at Baylen. His cavalry soon brought him the news that\r\nthe troops visible upon the hillsides were enemies: they consisted of\r\nthe brigade which Reding had told off at the beginning of the day to\r\nhold the height of San Cristobal and the Cerro del Ahorcado against\r\na possible attack from the rear. It was at last clear to Vedel that\r\nthings had not gone well at Baylen, and that it was his duty to press\r\nin upon the Spaniards, and endeavour to cut his way through to his\r\nchief. He had begun to deploy his troops across the defile, with the\r\nobject of attacking both the flanking hills, when two officers with a\r\nwhite flag rode out towards him. They announced to him that Dupont had\r\nbeen beaten, and had asked for a suspension of hostilities, which had\r\nbeen granted. La Peña’s troops had stayed their advance, and he was\r\nasked to do the same.\r\n\r\nEither because he doubted the truth of these statements, or because\r\nhe thought that his appearance would improve Dupont’s position, Vedel\r\nrefused to halt, and sent back the Spanish officers to tell Reding\r\nthat he should attack him. This he did with small delay, falling\r\non the brigade opposed to him with great fury. Boussard’s dragoons\r\ncharged the troops on the lower slopes of the Cerro del Ahorcado, and\r\nrode into two battalions who were so much relying on the armistice\r\nthat they were surprised with their arms still piled, cooking their\r\nevening meal. A thousand men were taken prisoners almost without firing\r\na shot[154]. Cassagnes’ infantry attacked the steep height of San\r\nCristobal with less good fortune: his first assault was beaten off,\r\nand Vedel was preparing to succour him, when a second white flag came\r\nout of Baylen. It was carried by a Spanish officer, who brought with\r\nhim De Barbarin, one of Dupont’s aides-de-camp. The general had sent a\r\nwritten communication ordering Vedel to cease firing and remain quiet,\r\nas an armistice had been concluded, and it was hoped that Castaños\r\nwould consent to a convention. The moment that his answer was received\r\nit should be passed on; meanwhile the attack must be stopped and the\r\ntroops withdrawn.\r\n\r\n  [154] Apparently they were the 1st battalion of the Irlanda\r\n  regiment, and the militia of Jaen, according to the narrative of\r\n  Maupoey and Goicoechea (Arteche, ii. 512).\r\n\r\nVedel obeyed: clearly he could do nothing else, for Dupont was his\r\nhierarchical superior, and, as far as he could see, was still a free\r\nagent. Moreover, De Barbarin told him of the very easy terms which\r\nthe commander-in-chief hoped to get from Castaños. If they could be\r\nsecured it would be unnecessary, as well as risky, to continue the\r\nattack. For La Peña might very possibly have annihilated the beaten\r\ndivision before Vedel could force his way to its aid, since horse and\r\nfoot were both ‘fought out,’ and there was neither strength nor spirit\r\nfor resistance left among them. Vedel therefore was justified in his\r\nobedience to his superior, and in his withdrawal to a point two miles\r\nup the La Carolina road.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Villoutreys, the emissary of Dupont, had reached the camp of\r\nCastaños at Andujar[155] late in the afternoon, and laid his chief’s\r\nproposals before the Spaniard. As might have been expected, they were\r\ndeclined--Dupont was in the trap, and it would have been absurd to let\r\nhim off so easily. No great objection was made to the retreat of Vedel,\r\nbut Castaños said that the corps caught between La Peña and Reding must\r\nlay down its arms. Early next morning (July 20) Villoutreys returned\r\nwith this reply to the French camp.\r\n\r\n  [155] Or, according to some authorities, met Castaños at the\r\n  first post-house out of Andujar, on the Baylen road.\r\n\r\nDupont meanwhile had spent a restless night. He had gone round the\r\nmiserable bivouac of his men, to see if they would be in a condition\r\nto fight next morning, in the event of the negotiations failing. The\r\nresult was most discouraging: the soldiers were in dire straits for\r\nwant of water, they had little to eat, and were so worn out that they\r\ncould not be roused even to gather in the wounded. The brigadiers and\r\ncolonels reported that they could hold out no prospect of a rally\r\non the morrow[156]. Only Privé, the commander of the heavy-cavalry\r\nbrigade, spoke in favour of fighting: the others doubted whether even\r\n2,000 men could be got together for a rush at the Spanish lines. When\r\nan aide-de-camp, whom Vedel had been allowed to send to his chief,\r\nasked whether it would not be possible to make a concerted attack on\r\nReding next morning, with the object of disengaging the surrounded\r\ndivision, Dupont told him that it was no use to dream of any such\r\nthing. Vedel must prepare for a prompt retreat, in order to save\r\nhimself; no more could be done.\r\n\r\n  [156] No one confesses the demoralization of the French troops\r\n  more than Foy. ‘Dupont voulait combattre encore.... Mais pour\r\n  exécuter des résolutions vigoureuses il fallait des soldats à\r\n  conduire. Or, ces infortunés n’étaient plus des soldats; c’était\r\n  un troupeau dominé par les besoins physiques, sur lequel les\r\n  influences morales n’avaient plus de prise. La souffrance avait\r\n  achevé d’énerver les courages.’\r\n\r\nAt dawn, nothing having been yet settled, La Peña wrote to Dupont\r\nthreatening that if the 1,000 men who had been captured by Vedel on\r\nthe previous day were not at once released, he should consider the\r\narmistice at an end, and order his division to advance. The request\r\nwas reasonable, as they had been surprised and taken while relying on\r\nthe suspension of arms. Dupont ordered his subordinate to send them\r\nback to Reding’s camp. Castaños meanwhile was pressing for a reply to\r\nhis demand for surrender: he had brought up Felix Jones’s division\r\nto join La Peña’s in the early morning, so that he had over 14,000\r\nmen massed on the right bank of the Rumblar and ready to attack[157].\r\nDupont was well aware of this, and had made up his mind to surrender\r\nwhen he realized the hopeless demoralization of his troops. Early in\r\nthe morning he called a council of war; the officers present, after a\r\nshort discussion, drew up and signed a document in which they declared\r\nthat ‘the honour of the French arms had been sufficiently vindicated\r\nby the battle of the previous day: that in accepting the enemy’s terms\r\nthe commander-in-chief was yielding to evident military necessity:\r\nthat, surrounded by 40,000 enemies, he was justified in averting by\r\nan honourable treaty the destruction of his corps.’ Only the cavalry\r\nbrigadier Privé, refused to put his name to the paper, on which\r\nappear the signatures of three generals of division, of the officers\r\ncommanding the artillery and engineers, of two brigadiers, and of three\r\ncommanders of regiments.\r\n\r\n  [157] Namely, 6,600 of La Peña’s men, 5,400 of Jones’s, and 2,500\r\n  or 3,000 of Cruz-Murgeon’s flying column.\r\n\r\nAfter this formality was ended Generals Chabert and Marescot rode out\r\nfrom the French camp and met Castaños. They had orders to make the\r\nbest terms they could: in a general way it was recognized that the\r\ncompromised division could not escape surrender, and that Vedel and\r\nDufour would probably have to evacuate Andalusia and stipulate for a\r\nfree passage to Madrid. The Spaniards were not, as it seems, intending\r\nto ask for much more. But while they were haggling on such petty points\r\nas the forms of surrender, and the exemption of officers’ baggage\r\nfrom search, a new factor was introduced into the discussion. Some\r\nirregulars from the Sierra Morena came to Castaños, bringing with them\r\nas a prisoner an aide-de-camp of Savary[158]. They had secured his\r\ndispatch, which was a peremptory order to Dupont to evacuate Andalusia\r\nwith all his three divisions, and fall back towards Madrid. This put\r\na new face on affairs, for Castaños saw that if he conceded a free\r\nretreat to Vedel and Dufour, he would be enabling them to carry out\r\nexactly the movement which Savary intended. To do so would clearly be\r\nundesirable: he therefore interposed in the negotiations, and declared\r\nthat the troops of these two generals should not be allowed to quit\r\nAndalusia by the road which had been hitherto proposed. They must be\r\nsent round by sea to some port of France not immediately contiguous\r\nwith the Spanish frontier.\r\n\r\n  [158] His name was Captain de Fénelon (Cabany, p. 178).\r\n\r\nChabert and Marescot, as was natural, declaimed vehemently against\r\nthis projected change in the capitulation, and declared that it was\r\ninadmissible. But they were answered in even more violent terms by\r\nthe turbulent Conde de Tilly, who attended as representative of the\r\nJunta of Seville. He taunted them with their atrocities at the sack\r\nof Cordova, and threatened that if the negotiations fell through no\r\nquarter should be given to the French army. At last Castaños suggested\r\na compromise: he offered to let Dupont’s troops, no less than those of\r\nVedel, return to France by sea, if the claim that the latter should be\r\nallowed to retreat on Madrid were withdrawn. This was conceding much,\r\nand the French generals accepted the proposal.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Castaños and Tilly, representing the Spaniards, and Chabert\r\nand Marescot, on behalf of Dupont, signed preliminaries, by which it\r\nwas agreed that the surrounded divisions should formally lay down\r\ntheir arms and become prisoners of war, while Vedel’s men should not\r\nbe considered to have capitulated, nor make any act of surrender. Both\r\nbodies of men should leave Andalusia by sea, and be taken to Rochefort\r\non Spanish vessels. ‘The Spanish army,’ so ran the curiously worded\r\nseventh article of the capitulation, ‘guarantees them against all\r\nhostile aggression during their passage.’ The other clauses contain\r\nnothing striking, save some rather liberal permissions to the French\r\nofficers to take away their baggage--each general was to be allowed two\r\nwheeled vehicles, each field officer or staff officer one--without its\r\nbeing examined. This article caught the eye of Napoleon, and has been\r\nnoted by many subsequent critics, who have maintained that Dupont and\r\nhis colleagues, gorged with the plunder of Cordova, surrendered before\r\nthey needed, in order to preserve their booty intact. That they yielded\r\nbefore it was inevitable we do not believe: but far more anxiety than\r\nwas becoming seems to have been shown regarding the baggage. This\r\nanxiety finds easy explanation if the Spanish official statement, that\r\nmore than £40,000 in hard cash, and a great quantity of jewellery and\r\nsilver plate was afterwards found in the _fourgons_ of the staff and\r\nthe superior officers, be accepted as correct[159].\r\n\r\n  [159] It will be found in the _Gazeta de Madrid_ of October 9,\r\n  1808. It is stated that 60,000 dollars in silver and 136,000\r\n  dollars in gold, besides much plate and jewellery, were found in\r\n  the _fourgons_ of Dupont and his staff.\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth clause of the capitulation had contents of still more\r\ndoubtful propriety: it was to the effect that as many pieces of church\r\nplate had been stolen at the sack of Cordova, Dupont undertook to make\r\na search for them and restore them to the sanctuaries to which they\r\nbelonged, if they could be found in existence. The confession was so\r\nscandalous, that we share Napoleon’s wonder that such a clause could\r\never have been passed by the two French negotiators; if they were aware\r\nthat the charge of theft was true (as it no doubt was), shame should\r\nhave prevented them from putting it on paper: if they thought it false,\r\nthey were permitting a gratuitous insult to the French army to be\r\ninserted in the capitulation.\r\n\r\nWhile the negotiations were going on, Dupont sent secret orders to\r\nVedel to abscond during the night, and to retreat on Madrid as fast as\r\nhe was able. Chabert and Marescot had of course no knowledge of this,\r\nor they would hardly have consented to include that general’s troops in\r\nthe convention. In accordance with his superior’s orders, and with the\r\nobvious necessities of the case, Vedel made off on the night of July\r\n20-21, leaving only a screen of pickets in front of his position, to\r\nconceal his departure from the Spaniards as long as was possible. On\r\nthe return of his plenipotentiaries to his camp on the morning of the\r\ntwenty-first, Dupont learnt, to his surprise and discontent, that they\r\nhad included Vedel’s division in their bargain with Castaños. But as\r\nthat officer was now far away--he had reached La Carolina at daybreak\r\nand Santa Elena by noon--the commander-in-chief hoped that his troops\r\nwere saved.\r\n\r\nThe anger of the Spaniards at discovering the evasion of the second\r\nFrench division may easily be imagined. Reding, who was the first to\r\nbecome aware of it, sent down an officer into Dupont’s camp, with the\r\nmessage that if Vedel did not instantly return, he should regard the\r\nconvention as broken, and fall upon the surrounded troops: he should\r\ngive no quarter, as he considered that treachery had been shown, and\r\nthat the armistice had been abused. Dupont could not hope to make a\r\nstand, and was at the enemy’s mercy. He directed his chief of the\r\nstaff to write an order bidding Vedel to halt, and sent it to him by\r\none of his aides-de-camp, accompanied by a Spanish officer. This did\r\nnot satisfy Reding, who insisted that Dupont should write an autograph\r\nletter of his own in stronger terms. His demand could not be refused,\r\nand the two dispatches reached Vedel almost at the same hour, as he was\r\nresting his troops at Santa Elena before plunging into the passes.\r\n\r\nVedel, as all his previous conduct had shown, was weak and wanting in\r\ninitiative. Some of his officers tried to persuade him to push on, and\r\nto leave Dupont to make the best terms for himself that he could. Much\r\nwas to be said in favour of this resolve: he might have argued that\r\nsince he had never been without the power of retreating, it was wrong\r\nof his superior to include him in the capitulation. His duty to the\r\nEmperor would be to save his men, whatever might be the consequences to\r\nDupont. The latter, surrounded as he was, could hardly be considered a\r\nfree agent, and his orders might be disregarded. But such views were\r\nfar from Vedel’s mind: he automatically obeyed his chief’s dispatch and\r\nhalted. Next day he marched his troops back to Baylen, in consequence\r\nof a third communication from Dupont.\r\n\r\nOn July 23 Dupont’s troops laid down their arms with full formalities,\r\ndefiling to the sound of military music before the divisions of La\r\nPeña and Jones, who were drawn up by the Rumblar bridge. On the\r\ntwenty-fourth Vedel’s and Dufour’s troops, without any such humiliating\r\nceremony, stacked their muskets and cannon on the hillsides east of\r\nBaylen and marched for the coast. When the two corps were numbered it\r\nwas found that 8,242 unwounded men had surrendered with Dupont: nearly\r\n2,000 more, dead or wounded, were left on the battle-field; seven or\r\neight hundred of the Swiss battalions had deserted and disappeared.\r\nWith Vedel 9,393 men laid down their arms[160]. Not only did he deliver\r\nup his own column, but he called down the battalion guarding the\r\nDespeña Perros pass. Even the troops left beyond the defiles in La\r\nMancha were summoned to surrender by the Spaniards, and some of them\r\ndid so, though they were not really included in the capitulation, which\r\nwas by its wording confined to French troops in Andalusia. But the\r\ncommanders of three battalions allowed themselves to be intimidated\r\nby Colonel Cruz-Murgeon, who went to seek them at the head of a few\r\ncavalry, and tamely laid down their arms[161].\r\n\r\n  [160] This total of 17,635, given in the Spanish returns, seems\r\n  absolutely certain. It tallies very well with the original\r\n  figures of the French divisions, when losses in the campaign\r\n  are allowed for. I find in the _Vaughan Papers_ a contemporary\r\n  Spanish scrap of unknown provenance, giving somewhat different\r\n  figures, as follows:--Dupont’s corps: unwounded prisoners,\r\n  6,000; killed and wounded on the field, 3,000; Swiss deserters,\r\n  1,200; sick captured in the hospitals, 400; making a total of\r\n  10,600. Whittingham, the English attaché in Castaños’ camp, gives\r\n  another set:--unwounded prisoners, 5,500; killed and wounded,\r\n  2,600; Swiss deserters, 1,100; making 9,200. But both of these\r\n  are confessedly rough estimates, though made on the spot. As to\r\n  the other French prisoners, the Vaughan document says that 9,100\r\n  surrendered with Vedel, 800 in the passes, and 700 more in La\r\n  Mancha.\r\n\r\n  [161] Battalions surrendered at Santa Cruz, and at Manzanares.\r\n  But the officer in command at Madridejos refused to be cajoled,\r\n  and retreated on Madrid.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards had won their success at very small cost. Reding’s\r\ndivision returned a casualty list of 117 dead and 403 wounded, in\r\nwhich were included the losses of the skirmish of July 16 as well as\r\nthose of the battle of the nineteenth. Coupigny lost 100 dead and 894\r\nwounded. La Peña’s and Cruz-Murgeon’s columns, which had barely got\r\ninto touch with the French when the armistice was granted, cannot have\r\nlost more than a score or two of men. The total is no more than 954.\r\nThere were in addition 998 prisoners captured by Vedel when he attacked\r\nfrom the rear, but these were, of course, restored on the twentieth, in\r\nconsequence of the orders sent by Dupont, along with two guns and two\r\nregimental standards.\r\n\r\nCastaños, a man of untarnished honour, had every intention of carrying\r\nout the capitulation. The French troops, divided into small columns,\r\nwere sent down to the coast, or to the small towns of the Lower\r\nGuadalquivir under Spanish escorts, which had some difficulty in\r\npreserving them from the fury of the peasantry. It was necessary to\r\navoid the large towns like Cordova and Seville, where the passage of\r\nthe unarmed prisoners would certainly have led to riots and massacres.\r\nAt Ecija the mob actually succeeded in murdering sixty unfortunate\r\nFrenchmen. But when the troops had been conducted to their temporary\r\ndestinations, it was found that difficulties had arisen. The amount of\r\nSpanish shipping available would not have carried 20,000 men. This was\r\na comparatively small hindrance, as the troops could have been sent off\r\nin detachments. But it was more serious that Lord Collingwood, the\r\ncommander of the British squadron off Cadiz, refused his permission for\r\nthe embarkation of the French. He observed that Castaños had promised\r\nto send Dupont’s army home by water, without considering whether he\r\nhad the power to do so. The British fleet commanded the sea, and was\r\nblockading Rochefort, the port which the capitulation assigned for the\r\nlanding of the captive army. No representative of Great Britain had\r\nsigned the convention[162], and she was not bound by it. He must find\r\nout, by consulting his government, whether the transference of the\r\ntroops of Dupont to France was to be allowed.\r\n\r\n  [162] There had been a British attaché, Captain Whittingham, at\r\n  Castaños’ head quarters. The French negotiators had tried to\r\n  induce him to approve the terms of capitulation. But he very\r\n  wisely refused, having no authority to do so.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of the difficulties raised by Collingwood, Castaños got\r\ninto communication with Dupont, and drew up six supplementary articles\r\nto the convention, in which it was stipulated that if the British\r\nGovernment objected to Rochefort as the port at which the French troops\r\nwere to be landed, some other place should be selected. If all passage\r\nby sea was denied, a way by land should be granted by the Spaniards.\r\nThis agreement was signed at Seville on August 6, but meanwhile the\r\nJunta was being incited to break the convention. Several of its more\r\nreckless and fanatical members openly broached the idea that no faith\r\nneed be kept with those who had invaded Spain under such treacherous\r\npretences. The newspapers were full of tales of French outrages, and\r\nprotests against the liberation of the spoilers of Cordova and Jaen.\r\n\r\nMatters came to a head when Dupont wrote to Morla, the Captain-General\r\nof Andalusia, to protest against further delays, and to require\r\nthat the first division of his army should be allowed to sail at\r\nonce [August 8]. He received in reply a most shameless and cynical\r\nletter[163]. The Captain-General began by declaring that there were\r\nno ships available. But he then went on to state that no more had\r\nbeen promised than that the Junta would request the British to allow\r\nthe French troops to sail. He supposed that it was probable that a\r\nblank refusal would be sent to this demand. Why should Britain allow\r\nthe passage by sea of troops who were destined to be used against her\r\non some other point of the theatre of war? Morla next insinuated\r\nthat Dupont himself must have been well aware that the capitulation\r\ncould not be carried out. ‘Your Excellency’s object in inserting\r\nthese conditions was merely to obtain terms which, impossible as they\r\nwere to execute, might yet give a show of honour to the inevitable\r\nsurrender.... What right have you to require the performance of these\r\nimpossible conditions on behalf of an army which entered Spain under a\r\npretence of alliance, and then imprisoned our King and princes, sacked\r\nhis palaces, slew and robbed his subjects, wasted his provinces, and\r\ntore away his crown?’\r\n\r\n  [163] This will be found printed at length in the Appendix of\r\n  Papers relating to Baylen.\r\n\r\nAfter a delay of some weeks Lord Collingwood sent in to the Junta the\r\nreply of his government. It was far from being of the kind that Morla\r\nand his friends had hoped. Canning had answered that no stipulations\r\nmade at Baylen could bind Great Britain, but that to oblige her\r\nallies, and to avoid compromising their honour, she consented to\r\nallow the French army to be sent back to France, and to be landed\r\nin successive detachments of 4,000 men at some port between Brest\r\nand Rochefort (i.e. at Nantes or L’Orient). It is painful to have to\r\nadd that neither the Junta of Seville nor the Supreme Central Junta,\r\nwhich superseded that body, took any steps to carry out this project.\r\nDupont himself, his generals, and his staff, were sent home to France,\r\nbut their unfortunate troops were kept for a time in cantonments in\r\nAndalusia, then sent on board pontoons in the Bay of Cadiz, where\r\nthey were subjected to all manner of ill usage and half-starved, and\r\nfinally dispatched to the desolate rock of Cabrera, in the Balearic\r\nIslands, where more than half of them perished of cold, disease, and\r\ninsufficient nourishment[164]. Vedel’s men were imprisoned no less than\r\nDupont’s, and the survivors were only released at the conclusion of the\r\ngeneral peace of 1814.\r\n\r\n  [164] For the horrors of Cabrera, the works of three of the\r\n  prisoners, Ducor of the Marines of the Guard, and Gille and Wagré\r\n  of Vedel’s division, may be consulted. Their story is deeply\r\n  distressing.\r\n\r\nSo ended the strange and ill-fought campaign of Baylen. It is clear\r\nthat Dupont’s misfortunes were of his own creation. He ought never to\r\nhave lingered at Andujar till July was far spent, but should either\r\nhave massed his three divisions and fallen upon Castaños, or have\r\nretired to a safe defensive position at Baylen or La Carolina and have\r\nwaited to be attacked. He might have united something over 20,000 men,\r\nand could have defied every effort of the 35,000 Spaniards to drive\r\nhim back over the Sierra Morena. By dividing his army into fractions\r\nand persisting in holding Andujar, he brought ruin upon himself. But\r\nthe precise form in which the ruin came about was due less to Dupont\r\nthan to Vedel. That officer’s blind and irrational march on La Carolina\r\nand abandonment of Baylen on July 17-18 gave the Spaniards the chance\r\nof interposing between the two halves of the French army. If Vedel had\r\nmade a proper reconnaissance on the seventeenth, he would have found\r\nthat Reding had not marched for the passes, but was still lingering at\r\nMengibar. Instead, however, of sweeping the country-side for traces of\r\nthe enemy, he credited a wild rumour, and hurried off to La Carolina,\r\nleaving the fatal gap behind him. All that followed was his fault: not\r\nonly did he compromise the campaign by his march back to the passes,\r\nbut when he had discovered his mistake he returned with a slowness that\r\nwas inexcusable. If he had used ordinary diligence he might yet have\r\nsaved Dupont on the nineteenth: it was his halt at Guarroman, while\r\nthe cannon of Baylen were thundering in his ears, that gave the last\r\nfinishing touch to the disaster. If he had come upon the battle-field\r\nat ten in the morning, instead of at five in the afternoon, he could\r\nhave aided his chief to cut his way through, and even have inflicted a\r\nheavy blow on Reding and Coupigny. A careful study of Vedel’s actions,\r\nfrom his first passage of the Sierra Morena to his surrender, shows\r\nthat on every possible occasion he took the wrong course.\r\n\r\nBut even if we grant that Vedel made every possible mistake, it is\r\nnevertheless true that Dupont fought his battle most unskilfully. If\r\nhe had marched on the morning instead of the night of July 18, he\r\nprobably might have brushed past the front of Reding and Coupigny\r\nwithout suffering any greater disaster than the loss of his baggage.\r\nEven as things actually fell out, it is not certain that he need have\r\nbeen forced to surrender. He had 10,000 men, the two Spanish generals\r\nhad 17,000, but had been forced to detach some 3,500 bayonets to guard\r\nagainst the possible reappearance of Vedel. If Dupont had refused\r\nto waste his men in partial and successive attacks, and had massed\r\nthem for a vigorous assault on the left wing of the Spaniards, where\r\nCoupigny’s position on the slopes of the Cerrajon was neither very\r\nstrong nor very well defined, he might yet have cut his way through,\r\nthough probably his immense baggage-train would have been lost. It\r\nis fair, however, to remember that this chance was only granted him\r\nbecause Castaños, in front of Andujar, was slow to discover his retreat\r\nand still slower to pursue him. If that officer had shown real energy,\r\nten thousand men might have been pressing Dupont from the rear before\r\neight o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nAs it was Dupont mismanaged all the details of his attack. He made four\r\nassaults with fractions of his army, and on a long front. The leading\r\nbrigades were completely worn out and demoralized before the reserves\r\nwere sent into action. The fifth assault, in which every man was at\r\nlast brought forward, failed because the majority of the troops were\r\nalready convinced that the day was lost, and were no longer capable of\r\nany great exertions. It is absurd to accuse Dupont of cowardice--he\r\nexposed his person freely and was wounded--and still more absurd to\r\ncharge him (as did the Emperor) with treason. He did not surrender\r\ntill he saw that there was no possible hope of salvation remaining.\r\nBut there can be no doubt that he showed great incapacity to grasp the\r\nsituation, lost his head, and threw away all his chances.\r\n\r\nAs to the Spaniards, it can truly be said that they were extremely\r\nfortunate, and that even their mistakes helped them. Castaños framed\r\nhis plan for surrounding Dupont on the hypothesis that the main French\r\narmy was concentrated at Andujar. If this had indeed been the case,\r\nand Dupont had retained at that place some 15,000 or 17,000 men, the\r\nturning movement of Reding and Coupigny would have been hazardous in\r\nthe extreme. But the French general was obliging enough to divide\r\nhis force into two equal parts, and his subordinate led away one of\r\nthe halves on a wild march back to the passes. Again Reding acted\r\nin the most strange and unskilful way on July 17; after defeating\r\nLiger-Belair and Dufour he ought to have seized Baylen. Instead, he\r\nremained torpid in his camp for a day and a half: this mistake led\r\nto the far more inexcusable error of Vedel, who failed to see his\r\nadversary, and marched off to La Carolina. But Vedel’s blindness does\r\nnot excuse Reding’s sloth. On the actual day of battle, on the other\r\nhand, Reding behaved very well: he showed considerable tenacity,\r\nand his troops deserve great credit. It was no mean achievement for\r\n13,000 or 14,000[165] Spaniards, their ranks full of raw recruits\r\nand interspersed with battalions levied only five weeks before, to\r\nwithstand the attack of 10,000 French, even if the latter were badly\r\nhandled by their general. The Andalusians had good reason to be proud\r\nof their victory, though they might have refrained from calling\r\nDupont’s Legions of Reserve and provisional regiments the ‘invincible\r\ntroops of Austerlitz and Friedland,’ as they were too prone to do. They\r\nhad at least succeeded in beating in the open field and capturing a\r\nwhole French army, a thing which no continental nation had accomplished\r\nsince the wars of the Revolution began.\r\n\r\n  [165] We must deduct the seven battalions (3,500 or 4,000\r\n  men) which had been detached to the rear to watch for Vedel’s\r\n  approach, and were never engaged with Dupont’s troops.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\nSir Charles Vaughan, always in search of first-hand\r\ninformation, called on Castaños and had a long conversation\r\nwith him concerning the Convention. I find among his papers the\r\nfollowing notes:--\r\n\r\n‘Among other particulars of the surrender, General Castaños\r\nstated that the French General Marescot had the greatest\r\ninfluence in bringing it about. The great difficulty was to\r\npersuade them [Marescot and Chabert] to capitulate for Vedel’s\r\narmy as well as Dupont’s. A letter had been intercepted\r\nordering Vedel back to Madrid, and another ordering Dupont to\r\nretire. This letter had considerable effect with the French:\r\nbut the offer of carrying away their baggage and the plunder of\r\nthe country was no sooner made, than the two generals desired\r\nto be permitted to retire and deliberate alone. After a few\r\nminutes they accepted the proposal. But General Castaños, to\r\nmake the article of as little value as possible, got them to\r\ninsert the clause that the French officers should be allowed\r\nto embark all their baggage, &c., _according to the laws of\r\nSpain_. He well knew that those laws forbid the exportation\r\nof gold and silver. The consequence was that the French lost\r\nall their more valuable plunder when embarking at Puerto Santa\r\nMaria.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH IN PORTUGAL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE OUTBREAK OF THE PORTUGUESE INSURRECTION\r\n\r\n\r\nDown to the moment of the general outbreak of the Spanish insurrection\r\nJunot’s task in Portugal had not been a difficult one. As long as Spain\r\nand France were still ostensibly allies, he had at his disposition a\r\nvery large army. He had entered Portugal in 1807 with 25,000 French\r\ntroops, and during the spring of 1808 he had received 4,000 men in\r\ndrafts from Bayonne, which more than filled up the gaps made in his\r\nbattalions by the dreary march from Ciudad Rodrigo to Abrantes[166].\r\nOf the three Spanish divisions which had been lent to him, Solano’s\r\nhad gone home to Andalusia, but he had still the two others, Caraffa’s\r\n(7,000 strong) in the valley of the Tagus, and Taranco’s at Oporto. The\r\nlast-named general died during the winter, but his successor, Belesta,\r\nstill commanded 6,000 men cantoned on the banks of the Douro. The\r\ndiscontent of the Portuguese during the early months of 1808 showed\r\nitself by nothing save a few isolated deeds of violence, provoked by\r\nparticular acts of oppression on the part of Junot’s subordinates.\r\nHow promptly and severely they were chastised has been told in an\r\nearlier chapter. There were no signs whatever of a general rising: the\r\nmeans indeed were almost entirely wanting. The regular army had been\r\ndisbanded or sent off to France. The organization of the militia had\r\nbeen dissolved. The greater part of the leading men of the country had\r\nfled to Brazil with the Prince-Regent: the bureaucracy and many of the\r\nclergy had shown a discreditable willingness to conciliate Junot by a\r\ntame subservience to his orders.\r\n\r\n  [166] See Thiébault, _Expédition de Portugal_, and Foy, iv. 363.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Abrantes himself thoroughly enjoyed his Viceroyalty, and\r\nstill deluded himself into believing that he might yet prove a popular\r\nruler in Portugal: perhaps he even dreamed of becoming some day one\r\nof Bonaparte’s vassal-kings. He persisted in the farce of issuing\r\nbenevolent proclamations, and expressing his affection for the noble\r\nPortuguese people, till his master at last grew angry. ‘Why,’ he wrote\r\nby the hand of his minister Clarke, ‘do you go on making promises\r\nwhich you have no authority to carry out? Of course, there is no end\r\nmore laudable than that of winning the affection and confidence of\r\nthe inhabitants of Portugal. But do not forget that the safety of the\r\nFrench army is the first thing. Disarm the Portuguese: keep an eye\r\non the disbanded soldiers, lest reckless leaders should get hold of\r\nthem and make them into the nucleus of rebel bands.... Lisbon is an\r\ninconveniently large place: it is too populous, and its people cannot\r\nhelp being hostile to you. Keep your troops outside it, in cantonments\r\nalong the sea-front’: and so forth[167]. Meanwhile financial exactions\r\nwere heaped on the unfortunate kingdom to contribute to the huge fine\r\nwhich the Emperor had laid upon it: but there was evidently no chance\r\nthat such a large sum could be raised, however tightly the screw of\r\ntaxation might be twisted. Junot accepted, as contributions towards\r\nthe £2,000,000 that he was told to raise, much confiscated English\r\nmerchandise, church plate, and private property of the royal house, but\r\nhis extortions did little more than pay for his army and the expenses\r\nof government. Portugal indeed was in a dismal state: her ports were\r\nblocked and her wines could not be sold to her old customers in\r\nEngland, nor her manufactures to her Brazilian colonists. The working\r\nclasses in Lisbon were thrown out of employment, and starved, or\r\nmigrated in bands into the interior. Foy and other good witnesses from\r\nthe French side speak of the capital as ‘looking like a desert, with\r\nno vehicles, and hardly a foot-passenger in the streets, save 20,000\r\npersons reduced to beggary and trying vainly to live on alms[168].’ The\r\nonly activity visible was in the arsenal and dockyards, where Junot had\r\n10,000 men at work restoring the neglected material of the artillery,\r\nand fitting out that portion of the fleet which had been in too bad\r\norder to sail for Brazil in the previous November.\r\n\r\n  [167] Compare _Nap. Corresp._, 13,608 and 13,620.\r\n\r\n  [168] Foy, iv. 273-4.\r\n\r\nThe sudden outbreak of the Spanish insurrection in the last days of\r\nMay, 1808, made an enormous change in the situation of the French\r\narmy in Portugal. Before Junot had well realized what was happening in\r\nthe neighbouring kingdom, his communications with Madrid were suddenly\r\ncut, and for the future information only reached him with the greatest\r\ndifficulty, and orders not at all. The last dispatch that came through\r\nto him was one from the Emperor which spoke of the beginnings of the\r\nrising, and bade him send 4,000 men to Ciudad Rodrigo to hold out a\r\nhand to Bessières, and 8,000 to the Guadiana to co-operate in Dupont’s\r\nprojected invasion of Andalusia[169]. These orders were dispatched in\r\nthe last days of May; before they could be carried out the situation\r\nhad been profoundly modified.\r\n\r\n  [169] _Nap. Corresp._, 14,023 (from Bayonne, May 29).\r\n\r\nOn June 6 there arrived at Oporto the news of the insurrection of\r\nGalicia and the establishment of the Provincial Junta at Corunna. The\r\nfirst thought of the new government in Galicia had been to call home\r\nfor its own defence the division in northern Portugal. When its summons\r\nreached General Belesta, he obeyed without a moment’s hesitation. The\r\nonly French near him were General Quesnel, the Governor of Oporto, his\r\nstaff, and a troop of thirty dragoons which served as his personal\r\nescort. Belesta seized and disarmed both the general and his guard, and\r\nforthwith marched for Spain, by Braga and Valenza, with his prisoners.\r\nBefore leaving he called together the notables of Oporto, bade them\r\nhoist the national flag, and incited them to nominate a junta to\r\norganize resistance against Junot. But he left not a man behind to aid\r\nthem, and took off his whole force to join General Blake.\r\n\r\nOn receiving, on June 9, the news of this untoward event, Junot\r\ndetermined to prevent Caraffa’s troops on the Tagus from following\r\nthe example of their countrymen. Before they had fully realized the\r\nsituation, or had time to concert measures for a general evasion,\r\nhe succeeded in disarming them. Caraffa himself was summoned to the\r\nquarters of the commander-in-chief, and placed under arrest before\r\nhe knew that he was suspected. Of his regiments some were ordered to\r\nattend a review, others to change garrisons; while unsuspectingly on\r\ntheir way, they found themselves surrounded by French troops and were\r\ntold to lay down their arms. All were successfully trapped except the\r\nsecond cavalry regiment, the ‘Queen’s Own,’ whose colonel rode off\r\nto Oporto with his two squadrons instead of obeying the orders sent\r\nhim, and fractions of the infantry regiments of Murcia and Valencia\r\nwho escaped to Badajoz after an ineffectual pursuit by the French\r\ndragoons. But 6,000 out of Caraffa’s 7,000 men were caught, disarmed,\r\nand placed on pontoons moored under the guns of the Lisbon forts, whose\r\ncommanders had orders to sink them if they gave any trouble. Here they\r\nwere destined to remain prisoners for the next ten weeks, till the\r\nEnglish arrived to release them after the battle of Vimiero.\r\n\r\nThe imminent danger that Caraffa’s force might openly revolt, and\r\nserve as the nucleus for a general rising of the Portuguese, was\r\nthus disposed of. But Junot’s position was still unpleasant: he had\r\nonly some 26,500 men with whom to hold down the kingdom: if once\r\nthe inhabitants took arms, such a force could not supply garrisons\r\nfor every corner of a country 300 miles long and a hundred broad.\r\nMoreover, there was considerable probability that the situation might\r\nbe complicated by the appearance of an English expeditionary army:\r\nNapoleon had warned his lieutenant to keep a careful watch on the side\r\nof the sea, even before the Spanish insurrection broke out. All through\r\nthe spring a British force drawn from Sicily was already hovering\r\nabout the southern coast of the Peninsula, though hitherto it had only\r\nbeen heard of in the direction of Gibraltar and Cadiz. Another cause\r\nof disquietude was the presence in the Tagus of the Russian fleet of\r\nAdmiral Siniavin: the strange attitude adopted by that officer much\r\nperplexed Junot. He acknowledged that his master the Czar was at war\r\nwith Great Britain, and stated that he was prepared to fight if the\r\nBritish fleet tried to force the entrance of the Tagus. But on the\r\nother hand he alleged that Russia had not declared war on Portugal or\r\nacknowledged its annexation by the Emperor, and he therefore refused to\r\nland his marines and seamen to help in the garrisoning of Lisbon, or to\r\nallow them to be used in any way on shore. Meanwhile his crews consumed\r\nan inordinate amount of the provisions which were none too plentiful in\r\nthe Portuguese capital.\r\n\r\nJunot’s main advantage lay in the extreme military impotence of\r\nPortugal. That realm found its one sole centre in Lisbon, where a\r\ntenth of the population of the whole kingdom and half of its wealth\r\nwere concentrated. At Lisbon alone was there an arsenal of any size,\r\nor a considerable store of muskets and powder. Without the resources\r\nof the capital the nation was absolutely unable to equip anything fit\r\nto be called an army. Oporto was a small place in comparison, and no\r\nother town in the kingdom had over 20,000 souls. Almeida and Elvas,\r\nthe two chief fortresses of the realm, were safe in the hands of French\r\ngarrisons. The provinces might rise, but without lavish help from Spain\r\nor England they could not put in the field an army of even 10,000 men,\r\nfor assemblies of peasants armed with pikes and fowling-pieces are not\r\narmies, and of field-artillery there was hardly a piece outside Lisbon,\r\nElvas, and Almeida. Nor was there left any nucleus of trained soldiers\r\naround which the nation might rally: the old army was dissolved and\r\nits small remnant was on the way to the Baltic. The case of Spain and\r\nof Portugal was entirely different when they rose against Napoleon.\r\nThe former country was in possession of the greater part of its own\r\nfortresses, had not been systematically disarmed, and could dispose--in\r\nGalicia and Andalusia--of large bodies of veteran troops. Portugal\r\nwas without an army, an arsenal, a defensible fortress, or a legal\r\norganization--civil or military--of any kind.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to remember this in order to excuse the utter\r\nfeebleness of the Portuguese rising in June, 1808. Otherwise it would\r\nhave seemed strange that a nation of over 2,000,000 souls could not\r\nanywhere produce forces sufficient to resist for a single day a column\r\nof 3,000 or 4,000 French soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection--such as it was--started in the north, where the\r\ndeparture of Belesta and his division had left the two provinces of\r\nTras-os-Montes and Entre-Douro-e-Minho free from any garrison, French\r\nor Spanish. Oporto had been bidden to work out its own salvation\r\nby Belesta, and on the day of his departure (June 6), a junta of\r\ninsurrection had been acclaimed. But there followed a curious interval\r\nof apathy, lasting for ten days: the natural leaders of the people\r\nrefused to come forward: here, just as in Spain, the bureaucracy showed\r\nitself very timid and unpatriotic. The magistrates sent secret offers\r\nof submission to Junot: the military commandant, Oliveira da Costa,\r\nhauled down the national flag from the citadel of San João da Foz. The\r\nmembers of the insurrectionary junta absconded from the city or kept\r\nquiet[170]. It was only on the news that the neighbouring districts and\r\ntowns had risen, that the people of Oporto threw themselves frankly\r\ninto the rebellion. The rough mountain districts which lay to the east\r\nof them showed a much more whole-hearted patriotism: between the ninth\r\nand the twelfth of June the whole of the Tras-os-Montes took arms: one\r\njunta at Braganza nominated as commander the aged General Sepulveda,\r\nwho had been governor of the district in the days of the Prince-Regent:\r\nanother, at Villa Real on the Douro, also put in its claim and chose\r\nas its leader Colonel Silveira, an officer who was destined to see\r\nmuch service during the war of independence. Though the French were no\r\nfurther off than Almeida, the rival governors nearly came to blows,\r\nbut the final insurrection of Oporto created a new power to which both\r\nconsented to bow.\r\n\r\n  [170] For these incidents, so discreditable to the leading men\r\n  of Oporto, see Foy, iv. 206, and Toreño, i. 152. Most Peninsular\r\n  historians consign them to oblivion.\r\n\r\nOn June 18 the false report that a French column was drawing near\r\nOporto so roused the multitude in that city that they broke loose\r\nfrom the control of the authorities, rehoisted the Portuguese flag,\r\nthrew into prison Da Costa and many other persons suspected, rightly\r\nor wrongly, of a wish to submit to the enemy, and called for the\r\nestablishment of a provisional government. Accordingly a ‘Supreme Junta\r\nof the Kingdom’ was hastily elected with the Bishop of Oporto at its\r\nhead. This was a strange choice, for the aged prelate, Dom Antonio\r\nde Castro, though popular and patriotic, was neither a statesman\r\nnor an administrator, and had no notion whatever as to the military\r\nnecessities of the situation. However, the other local juntas of\r\nNorthern Portugal united in recognizing his authority. His colleagues\r\nstarted on the organization of an army with more zeal than discretion;\r\nthey called out the militia which Junot had disbanded, and tried to\r\nreconstruct some of the old regular battalions, by getting together\r\nthe half-pay officers, and the men who had been dismissed from the\r\ncolours in December, 1807. But they also encouraged the assembly of\r\nthousands of peasants armed with pikes and scythes, who consumed\r\nprovisions, but were of no military use whatever. In the seven weeks\r\nwhich elapsed before the coming of the English, the Supreme Junta had\r\nonly got together 5,000 men properly equipped and told off into regular\r\ncorps[171]. The fact was that they could provide arms for no more,\r\nNorthern Portugal having always looked to Lisbon for its supplies.\r\nField artillery was almost wholly wanting--perhaps a dozen guns in all\r\nhad been found: of cavalry three skeleton regiments were beginning to\r\nbe organized. But of half-armed peasantry, disguised under the name of\r\nmilitia, they had from 12,000 to 15,000 in the field.\r\n\r\n  [171] They re-embodied the old 2nd, 12th, 21st, and 24th\r\n  battalions of infantry of the line, the 6th Cazadores, and the\r\n  6th, 11th, and 12th light cavalry, as well as one or two other\r\n  old corps whose numbers I cannot identify.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Junta also concluded a treaty of offensive and defensive\r\nalliance with the Galician Spaniards, from whom they hoped to get\r\narms, and perhaps a loan of troops. Moreover they sent two envoys to\r\nEngland to ask for aid, and eagerly welcomed at Oporto Colonel Brown,\r\na British agent with a roving commission, who did his best to assist\r\nin organizing the new levies. The command of the whole armed force\r\nwas given to General Bernardino Freire, a pretentious and incapable\r\nperson, who turned his very moderate resources to no profitable account\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nA few days later than the outbreak of the insurrection in the regions\r\nnorth of the Douro, there was a corresponding movement, but of a weaker\r\nkind, in the extreme south. On June 16 the small fishing-town of Olhão\r\nin Algarve gave the signal for revolt: on the eighteenth Faro, the\r\ncapital of the province, followed the example. General Maurin, the\r\nGovernor of Algarve, was lying ill in his bed; he was made prisoner\r\nalong with seventy other French officers and men, and handed over to\r\nthe captain of an English ship which was hovering off the coast. The\r\nwhole shore between the Sierra de Caldeirão and the sea took arms,\r\nwhereupon Colonel Maransin, Maurin’s second-in-command, resolved\r\nto evacuate the province. He had only 1,200 men, a battalion each\r\nof the 26th of the line and the _Légion du Midi_, and had lost his\r\ncommunications with Lisbon, wherefore he drew together his small force\r\nand fell back first on Mertola and then on Beja, in the Alemtejo.\r\nThe insurgents whom he left behind him could do little till they had\r\nobtained muskets from Seville and Gibraltar, and made no attempt to\r\nfollow the retreating column northwards.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Junot, even after he had succeeded in disarming Caraffa’s\r\nSpanish division, was passing through a most anxious time. In obedience\r\nto the Emperor’s orders he had sent a brigade under General Avril\r\ntowards Andalusia, to help Dupont, and another under Loison to Almeida\r\nto open communications with Bessières. But these detachments had\r\nbeen made under two false ideas, the one that the troubles in Spain\r\nwere purely local, the other that Portugal would keep quiet. Avril\r\nmarched southward with 3,000 men, but, when his vanguard reached San\r\nLucar on the Spanish border, he found Andalusian militia provided\r\nwith artillery watching him across the Guadiana. He also learnt\r\nthat a large force was assembling at Badajoz, and that Dupont had\r\ngot no further than Cordova--more than 150 miles away. After some\r\nhesitation he retraced his steps till he halted at Estremoz, facing\r\nBadajoz. Loison had much the same experience: starting from Almeida he\r\ncrossed the border and scared away the small Spanish garrison of Fort\r\nConcepcion: but when he drew near Ciudad Rodrigo and learnt that the\r\nplace was strongly held, that all the kingdom of Leon was in revolt,\r\nand that Bessières was still far distant in Old Castile, he drew back\r\nto Almeida [June 12-15]. Returning thither he heard of the troubles in\r\nNorthern Portugal, and resolved to march on Oporto, which was still\r\nholding back from open insurrection when the news reached him. He\r\ndetermined to hasten to that important city and to garrison it. Taking\r\ntwo battalions and a few guns, while he left the rest of his brigade\r\nat Almeida, he marched on Oporto, crossed the Douro at the ferry of\r\nPezo-de-Ragoa, and began to move on Amarante [June 21]. But the moment\r\nthat he was over the river, he found himself in the middle of the\r\ninsurrection: among the mountains the peasantry began to fire from\r\nabove on his long column, to roll rocks down the slopes at him, and to\r\nharass his baggage and rearguard. Seeing that he had only 2,000 men in\r\nhand, and that the whole country-side was up, Loison wisely returned\r\nto Almeida, which he regained by a circular march through Lamego and\r\nCelorico, dispersing several bands of insurgents on the way, for the\r\nrebellion had already begun to spread across the Douro into the hills\r\nof Northern Beira [July 1].\r\n\r\nLisbon in the meanwhile was on the verge of revolt, but was still\r\ncontained by the fact that Junot held concentrated in and about it the\r\nmain body of his army, some 15,000 men. On the Feast of Corpus Christi\r\n(June 16) the annual religious procession through the streets nearly\r\nled to bloodshed. This was the greatest festival of Lisbon, and had\r\nalways led to the assembly of enormous crowds: Junot allowed it to be\r\nonce more celebrated, but lined the streets with soldiers, and placed\r\nartillery ready for action in the main squares and avenues. While the\r\nfunction was in progress a senseless panic broke out among the crowd,\r\nsome shouting that they felt a shock of earthquake (always a terror in\r\nLisbon since the catastrophe of 1755), others that the English were\r\nlanding, others that the soldiers were about to fire on the people.\r\nThe frantic mob burst through the military cordon, the procession was\r\nbroken up, the prelate who bore the Sacrament took refuge in a church,\r\nand the tumult grew so wild that the artillery were about to open\r\nwith grape, thinking that they had to deal with a carefully prepared\r\ninsurrection. A great and miscellaneous slaughter was only prevented\r\nby the coolness of Junot, who threw himself into the throng, prevented\r\nthe troops from firing, cleared the street, prevailed on the clergy to\r\nfinish the procession, and dispersed the multitudes with no loss of\r\nlife save that of a few persons crushed or trampled to death in the\r\npanic.\r\n\r\nBut though this tumult passed off without a disaster, Junot’s position\r\nwas uncomfortable. He had just begun to realize the real proportions of\r\nthe insurrection in Spain, which had now completely cut him off from\r\ncommunication with his colleagues. He had only the vaguest knowledge of\r\nhow Dupont and Bessières were faring: and the fact that large Spanish\r\nforces were gathering both at Ciudad Rodrigo and at Badajoz inclined\r\nhim to think that affairs must be going ill in Castile and Andalusia.\r\nThe long-feared English invasion seemed at last to be growing imminent:\r\nGeneral Spencer’s division from Sicily and Gibraltar was at sea, and\r\nhad showed itself first off Ayamonte and the coast of Algarve, then off\r\nthe Tagus-mouth. Ignorant that Spencer had only 5,000 men, and that he\r\nhad been brought near Lisbon merely by a false report that the garrison\r\nhad been cut down to a handful, Junot expected a disembarkation. But\r\nSpencer went back to Cadiz when he learnt that there were 15,000\r\ninstead of 4,000 men ready to defend the capital.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the populace of Lisbon was stirred up by all manner of wild\r\nrumours: it was said that Loison had been surrounded and forced to\r\nsurrender by the northern insurgents, that the Spanish army of Galicia\r\nwas marching south, that an English corps had landed at Oporto. All\r\nsorts of portents and signs were reported for the benefit of the\r\nsuperstitious. The most preposterous was one which we should refuse\r\nto credit if it were not vouched for by Foy, and other respectable\r\nFrench authorities. A hen’s egg was found on the high-altar of the\r\npatriarchal church, with the inscription _Morran os Franceses_ (‘Death\r\nto the French’) indented in its shell. This caused such excitement\r\nthat Junot thought it worth while to show that a similar phenomenon\r\ncould be produced on any egg by a skilful application of acids. When\r\nhis chemists exhibited several branded in an equally convincing way\r\nwith the words, _Vive l’Empereur!_ the enthusiasm of the credulous was\r\nsomewhat damped[172].\r\n\r\n  [172] Foy, iv. 276; Napier, i. 97.\r\n\r\nRecognizing that he could expect no further help from the French\r\narmies in Spain, and that the insurrection would certainly spread over\r\nevery parish of Portugal that did not contain a garrison, Junot wisely\r\nresolved to concentrate the outlying fractions of his army, which lay\r\nexposed and isolated at points far from Lisbon. At a council of war,\r\nheld on June 25, he laid before his chief officers the alternatives\r\nof evacuating Portugal and retiring on Madrid by the way of Badajoz,\r\nor of uniting the army in the neighbourhood of Lisbon and making an\r\nattempt to hold Central Portugal, while abandoning the extreme north\r\nand south. The latter plan was unanimously adopted: in the state\r\nof ignorance in which the generals lay as to what was going on at\r\nMadrid and elsewhere in Spain, the retreat by Badajoz seemed too\r\nhazardous. Moreover, it was certain to provoke Napoleon’s wrath if it\r\nturned out to have been unnecessary. Accordingly it was resolved to\r\nplace garrisons in the fortresses of Elvas, Almeida and Peniche, to\r\nfortify Setuval on the peninsula opposite Lisbon, and to draw in all\r\nthe rest of the troops to the vicinity of the capital. Dispatches to\r\nthis effect were sent to Loison at Almeida, to Avril at Estremoz, to\r\nMaransin at Mertola, and to Kellermann, who was watching Badajoz from\r\nElvas[173]. Many of the aides-de-camp who bore these orders were cut\r\noff by the insurgents[174], but in the end copies of each dispatch were\r\ntransmitted to their destinations. In several instances the detached\r\ncorps had begun to fall back on the Tagus, even before they received\r\nthe command to do so.\r\n\r\n  [173] For the twelve resolutions arrived at by the council of\r\n  war, see the analysis given by Thiébault, one of its members.\r\n\r\n  [174] Foy says that of twenty messages sent to Loison only one\r\n  got through.\r\n\r\nThis was the case with Maransin at Mertola, who, finding himself\r\nhopelessly isolated with 1,200 men in the centre of the insurrection,\r\nhad marched on Lisbon via Beja. On June 26 he reached the latter place\r\nand found its ancient walls manned by a disorderly mass of citizens,\r\nwho fired upon him as he drew near. But he stormed the town without\r\nmuch difficulty, cruelly sacked it, and resumed his march on Lisbon\r\nunharmed. This was not the first fighting that had occurred in the\r\nAlemtejo; four days before Avril had had to march from Estremoz to\r\nchastise the inhabitants of Villa Viciosa, who had taken arms and\r\nbesieged the company of the 86th regiment which garrisoned their town.\r\nHe scattered them with much slaughter, and, after the usual French\r\nfashion, plundered the little place from cellar to garret.\r\n\r\nOn receiving Junot’s orders, General Kellermann, who bore the chief\r\ncommand in the Alemtejo, left a battalion and a half[175]--1,400\r\nmen--in Elvas and its outlying fort of La Lippe. With the rest he\r\nretired on Lisbon, picking up first the corps of Avril and then that of\r\nMaransin, which met him at Evora. He then entered the capital, leaving\r\nonly one brigade, that of Graindorge, at Setuval to the south of the\r\nTagus [July 3].\r\n\r\n  [175] The 2nd Swiss, and four companies of the 86th regiment.\r\n\r\nLoison in the north did not receive his orders for a full week after\r\nthey were sent out, owing to the disorderly state of the intervening\r\ncountry. But on July 4 he left Almeida, after making for it a garrison\r\nof 1,200 men, by drafting into a provisional battalion all his soldiers\r\nwho did not seem fit for forced marching. He then moved for seven days\r\nthrough the mountains of Beira to Abrantes, skirmishing with small\r\nbands of insurgents all the way. At two or three places they tried to\r\nblock his path, and the town of Guarda made a serious attempt to defend\r\nitself, and was in consequence sacked and partly burnt. Leaving a trail\r\nof ruined villages behind him, Loison at last reached Abrantes and got\r\ninto communication with his chief. He had lost on the way 200 men,\r\nmostly stragglers whom the peasantry murdered: but he had inflicted\r\nsuch a cruel lesson on the country-side that his popular nickname\r\n(_Maneta_, ‘One-Hand’) was held accursed for many years in Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of the French troops from the outlying provinces gave\r\nthe insurrection full scope for development. It followed close in\r\nthe track of the retiring columns, and as each valley was evacuated\r\nits inhabitants hoisted the national flag, sent in their vows of\r\nallegiance to the Junta at Oporto, and began to organize armed bands.\r\nBut there was such a dearth of military stores that very few men\r\ncould be properly equipped with musket and bayonet. Junot had long\r\nbefore called in the arms of the disbanded militia, and destroyed\r\nthem or forwarded them to Lisbon. In the southern provinces the lack\r\nof weapons was even worse than in the valley of the Douro: there was\r\npractically no armament except a few hundred muskets hastily borrowed\r\nfrom the Spaniards of Badajoz and Seville, and a small dépôt of\r\ncavalry equipment at Estremoz which Avril had forgotten to carry off.\r\nAn insurrectionary junta for the Alemtejo was formed at Evora, but\r\nits general, Francisco Leite, could only succeed in equipping the\r\nmere shadow of an army. In the north things were a little better: the\r\nrising spread to Coimbra in the last week of June, and one of its\r\nfirst leaders, the student Bernardo Zagalo, succeeded in capturing the\r\nsmall coast-fortress of Figueira by starving out the scanty French\r\ngarrison, which had been caught wholly destitute of provisions [June\r\n27]. Bernardino Freire then brought up the 5,000 regular troops,\r\nwhich the Junta of Oporto had succeeded in getting together, as far\r\nas the line of the Mondego. But the insurrectionary area spread much\r\nfurther southward, even up to Leyria and Thomar, which lie no more than\r\nsixty-five miles from the capital. From these two places, however, the\r\nrebels were easily cleared out by a small expedition of 3,000 men under\r\nGeneral Margaron [July 5]. Junot’s army in the second week of July\r\nheld nothing outside the narrow quadrangle of which Setuval, Peniche,\r\nAbrantes, and Lisbon form the four points. But within that limited\r\nspace there were now 24,000 good troops, concentrated and ready to\r\nstrike a blow at the first insurrectionary force that might press in\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nBut for a fortnight the Portuguese made no further move, and Junot\r\nnow resolved to attack the insurgents who lay beyond the Tagus in the\r\nplains of the Alemtejo. His chief motive seems to have been the wish to\r\nreopen his communications with Elvas, and to keep the way clear towards\r\nBadajoz, the direction in which he would have to retreat, if ever he\r\nmade up his mind to evacuate Lisbon and retire on Spain. Accordingly,\r\non July 25, he sent out the energetic Loison at the head of a strong\r\nflying column--seven and a half battalions, two regiments of dragoons,\r\nand eight guns--over 7,000 men in all[176]. This force was directed\r\nto march on Elvas by way of Evora, the capital of the Alemtejo, and\r\nthe seat of its new Junta. On July 29 Loison appeared before the walls\r\nof that city. To his surprise the enemy offered him battle in the\r\nopen; General Leite had brought up such of his newly organized troops\r\nas he could collect--they amounted to no more than a battalion and\r\na half of infantry and 120 horse; but to help him there had come up\r\nfrom Badajoz the Spanish Colonel Moretti with about the same number of\r\nfoot, a regiment of regular cavalry (the ‘Hussars of Maria Luisa’), and\r\nseven guns[177]. In all the allies had under 3,000 men, but they were\r\npresumptuous enough to form a line of battle outside Evora, and wait\r\nfor Loison’s attack. A mixed multitude of peasants and citizens, more\r\nof them armed with pikes than with fowling-pieces, manned the walls of\r\nthe town behind them. Leite and his colleague should have drawn back\r\ntheir regulars to the same position: they might have been able to do\r\nsomething behind walls, but to expose them in the open to the assault\r\nof more than double of their own numbers of French troops was absurd.\r\n\r\n  [176] The column comprised the following troops:--\r\n\r\n    Two battalions of Reserve Grenadiers                   1,100\r\n    12th Léger (3rd batt.)                                 1,253\r\n    15th Léger (3rd batt.)                                 1,305\r\n    58th Line (3rd batt.)                                  1,428\r\n    86th Line, twelve companies of the 1st and 2nd batts.  1,667\r\n    1st Hanoverian Legion                                    804\r\n    4th and 5th Provisional Dragoons                       1,248\r\n\r\n  Deducting 1,200 for detached grenadier companies, &c., the whole\r\n  was well over 7,000. For details, see Thiébault’s _Expédition de\r\n  Portugal_.\r\n\r\n  [177] The figures of the Portuguese historian, Accursio das\r\n  Neves, reproduced in Arteche (ii. 35), seem indubitable, as\r\n  they go into minute accounts of the regiments and fractions of\r\n  regiments present. It seems clear that the allies had nothing\r\n  like the 5,000 regular troops of which Foy speaks (iv. 267-8).\r\n\r\nLoison’s first charge broke the weak line of the allied army; the\r\nSpanish cavalry fled without crossing swords with the French, and\r\nGeneral Leite left the field with equal precipitation. But the bulk\r\nof the infantry fell back on Evora and aided the peasantry to defend\r\nits ruined mediaeval walls. They could not hold out, however, for\r\nmany minutes; the French forced their way in at four or five points,\r\nmade a great slaughter in the streets, and ended the day by sacking\r\nthe city with every detail of sacrilege and brutality. Foy says that\r\n2,000 Spaniards and Portuguese fell; his colleague Thiébault gives the\r\nincredible figure of 8,000. Even the smaller number must include a good\r\nmany unarmed inhabitants of Evora massacred during the sack. The French\r\nlost ninety killed and 200 wounded [July 29].\r\n\r\nOn the third day after the fight Loison marched for Elvas, and drove\r\naway the hordes which were blockading it. He was then preparing to\r\npush a reconnaissance in force against Badajoz, when he received\r\nfrom his commander-in-chief orders to return at once to Lisbon. The\r\nlong-expected English invasion of Portugal had at last begun, for on\r\nAugust 1 Sir Arthur Wellesley was already disembarking his troops\r\nin Mondego Bay. Junot was therefore set on concentrating in order to\r\nfight, and Loison’s expeditionary force was too important a part of\r\nhis army to be left out of the battle. Dropping the battalion of the\r\nHanoverian Legion as a garrison at Santarem, Loison brought the rest of\r\nhis 7,000 men to his commander’s aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nLANDING OF THE BRITISH: COMBAT OF ROLIÇA\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the first moment when the Asturian deputies arrived in London,\r\nwith the news of the insurrection in Northern Spain [June 4], the\r\nEnglish Government had been eager to intervene in the Peninsula.\r\nThe history of the last fifteen years was full of the records of\r\nunfortunate expeditions sent out to aid national risings, real or\r\nimaginary, against France. They had mostly turned out disastrous\r\nfailures: it is only necessary to mention the Duke of York’s miserable\r\ncampaign of 1799 in Holland, Stewart’s invasion of Calabria in 1806,\r\nand Whitelock’s disgraceful fiasco at Buenos Ayres in 1807. As a rule\r\nthe causes of their ill success had been partly incapable leading,\r\npartly an exaggerated parsimony in the means employed. Considering the\r\nvast power of France, it was futile to throw ashore bodies of five\r\nthousand, ten thousand, or even twenty thousand men on the Continent,\r\nand to expect them to maintain themselves by the aid of small local\r\ninsurrections, such as those of the Orange party in Holland or the\r\nCalabrian mountaineers. The invasion of Spanish South America, on the\r\nhypothesis that its inhabitants were all prepared to revolt against the\r\nmother-country--a fiction of General Miranda--had been even more unwise.\r\n\r\nThe ‘policy of filching sugar islands,’ as Sheridan wittily called\r\nit--of sending out expeditions of moderate size, which only inflicted\r\npin-pricks on non-vital portions of the enemy’s dominions--was still\r\nin full favour when the Spanish War began. There was hardly a British\r\nstatesman who rose above such ideas; Pitt and Addington, Fox and\r\nGrenville, and the existing Tory government of the Duke of Portland,\r\nhad all persisted in the same futile plans. At the best such warfare\r\nresulted in the picking up of stray colonies, such as Ceylon and\r\nTrinidad, the Cape, St. Thomas, or Curaçao: but in 1808 the more\r\nimportant oversea possessions of France and her allies were still\r\nunsubdued. At the worst the policy led to checks and disasters small\r\nor great, like Duckworth’s failure at Constantinople, the abortive\r\nEgyptian expedition of 1807, or the catastrophe of Buenos Ayres.\r\nCastlereagh seems to have been the only leading man who dared to\r\ncontemplate an interference on a large scale in Continental campaigns.\r\nHis bold scheme for the landing of 60,000 men in Hanover, during the\r\nwinter of 1805-6, had been foiled partly by the hesitation of his\r\ncolleagues, partly by the precipitation with which Francis II made\r\npeace after Austerlitz[178].\r\n\r\n  [178] This fine and not unpromising scheme deserves study (see\r\n  Alison’s _Life of Castlereagh_, i. 199-202).\r\n\r\nBut the policy of sending small auxiliary forces to the Iberian\r\nPeninsula was quite a familiar one. We had maintained a few thousand\r\nmen under Generals Burgoyne and Townsend for the defence of Portugal\r\nagainst Spain in 1762. And again in 1801 there had been a small\r\nBritish division employed in the farcical war which had ended in\r\nthe Treaty of Badajoz. In the year after Austerlitz, when it seemed\r\nlikely that Bonaparte might take active measures against Portugal,\r\nthe Fox-Grenville ministry had offered the Regent military aid, but\r\nhad seen it politely refused, for the timid prince was still set on\r\nconciliating the Emperor.\r\n\r\nWith so many precedents before them, it was natural that the Portland\r\ncabinet should assent to the demands of the Spanish deputies who\r\nappeared in London in June, 1808. The insurrection in the Iberian\r\nPeninsula was so unexpected[179] and so fortunate a chance, that it\r\nwas obviously necessary to turn it to account. Moreover, its attendant\r\ncircumstances were well calculated to rouse enthusiasm even in the\r\nbreasts of professional politicians. Here was the first serious sign\r\nof that national rising against Bonaparte which had been so often\r\nprophesied, but which had been so long in coming. Even the Whigs,\r\nwho had systematically denounced the sending of aid to the ‘effete\r\ndespotisms of the Continent,’ and had long maintained that Napoleon\r\nwas not so black as he was painted, were disarmed in their criticisms\r\nby the character of the Spanish rising. What excuse could be made for\r\nthe treachery at Bayonne? And how could sympathy be refused to a people\r\nwhich, deprived of its sovereign and betrayed by its bureaucracy,\r\nhad so gallantly taken arms to defend its national existence? The\r\ndebates in the British Parliament during the middle days of June show\r\nclearly that both the Government and the Opposition had grasped the\r\nsituation, and that for once they were united as to the policy which\r\nshould be pursued. It is only needful to quote a few sentences from the\r\nspeeches of Canning as Foreign Secretary, and Sheridan as Leader of the\r\nOpposition [June 15].\r\n\r\n  [179] I cannot quite credit the story that Toreño and Arteche\r\n  repeat of Pitt’s dying prophecy, that ‘Napoleon could only be\r\n  overthrown by a national war, and that such a war would probably\r\n  begin in Spain.’\r\n\r\n‘Whenever any nation in Europe,’ said Canning, ‘starts up with a\r\ndetermination to oppose that power which (whether professing insidious\r\npeace or declaring open war) is alike the common enemy of all other\r\npeoples, that nation, whatever its former relations with us may have\r\nbeen, becomes _ipso facto_ the ally of Great Britain. In furnishing\r\nthe aid which may be required, the Government will be guided by three\r\nprinciples--to direct the united efforts of both countries against the\r\ncommon foe, to direct them in such a way as shall be most beneficial\r\nto our common ally, and to direct them to such objects as may be\r\nmost conducive to British interests. But of these objects the last\r\nshall never be allowed to come into competition with the other two. I\r\nmention British interests chiefly for the purpose of disclaiming them\r\nas any material part of the considerations which influence the British\r\nGovernment. No interest can be so purely British as Spanish success:\r\nno conquest so advantageous to England as conquering from France the\r\ncomplete integrity of the Spanish dominions in every quarter of the\r\nglobe.’\r\n\r\nSheridan repeats the same theme in a slightly different key:--‘Hitherto\r\nBuonaparte has run a victorious race, because he has contended with\r\nprinces without dignity, ministers without wisdom, and peoples without\r\npatriotism. He has yet to learn what it is to combat a nation who are\r\nanimated with one spirit against him. Now is the time to stand up\r\nboldly and fairly for the deliverance of Europe, and if the ministry\r\nwill co-operate effectually with the Spanish patriots they shall\r\nreceive from us cordial support.... Never was anything so brave, so\r\nnoble, so generous as the conduct of the Spaniards: never was there a\r\nmore important crisis than that which their patriotism has occasioned\r\nto the state of Europe. Instead of striking at the core of the evil,\r\nthe Administrations of this country have hitherto gone on nibbling\r\nmerely at the rind: filching sugar islands, but neglecting all that was\r\ndignified and consonant to the real interests of the country. Now is\r\nthe moment to let the world know that we are resolved to stand up for\r\nthe salvation of Europe. Let us then co-operate with the Spaniards, but\r\nco-operate in an effectual and energetic way. And if we find that they\r\nare really heart and soul in the enterprise, let us advance with them,\r\nmagnanimous and undaunted, for the liberation of mankind.... Above all,\r\nlet us mix no little interests of our own in this mighty combat. Let us\r\ndiscard or forget British objects, and conduct the war on the principle\r\nof generous support and active co-operation.’\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be hypercritical to point out the weak spot in each\r\nof these stirring harangues. But Canning protested a little too\r\nmuch--within a few weeks of his speech the British Government was\r\napplying to the Junta of Seville to allow them to garrison Cadiz,\r\nwhich was refused (and rightly), for in the proposal British interests\r\npeeped out a little too clearly. And Sheridan, speaking from vague and\r\novercoloured reports of the state of affairs in the Peninsula, went too\r\nfar when he extolled the unmixed generosity and nobility of the conduct\r\nof the Spaniards: mingled with their undoubted patriotism there was\r\nenough of bigotry and cruelty, of self-seeking and ignorance, to make\r\nhis harangue ring somewhat false in the ears of future generations. Yet\r\nboth Canning and Sheridan spoke from the heart, and their declarations\r\nmark a very real turning-point in the history of the great struggle\r\nwith Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Great Britain, and for the nations of the Iberian\r\nPeninsula, we were far better prepared for striking a heavy blow on\r\nthe Continent in 1808 than we had been at any earlier period of the\r\nwar. There was no longer any need to keep masses of men ready in the\r\nsouth-eastern counties for the defence of England against a French\r\ninvasion. There were no longer any French forces of appreciable\r\nstrength garrisoned along the English Channel: indeed Castlereagh\r\nhad just been planning a raid to burn the almost unprotected French\r\nflotilla which still mouldered in the harbour of Boulogne. Our\r\nstanding army had recently been strengthened and reorganized by a not\r\ninconsiderable military reform. The system had just been introduced by\r\nwhich Wellington’s host was destined to be recruited during the next\r\nsix years. Every year two-fifths of the 120,000 embodied militia of\r\nthe United Kingdom were to be allowed to volunteer into the regular\r\narmy, while the places of the volunteers were filled up by men raised\r\nby ballot from the counties. This sort of limited conscription worked\r\nwell: in the year 1808 it gave 41,786 men to the line, and these\r\nnot raw recruits, but already more or less trained to arms by their\r\nservice in the militia. All through the war this system continued: the\r\nPeninsular army, it must always be remembered, drew more than half its\r\nreinforcing drafts from the ‘old constitutional force.’ Hence came the\r\nease with which it assimilated its recruits. Meanwhile the embodied\r\nmilitia never fell short in establishment, as it was automatically\r\nreplenished by the ballot. The result of these changes, for which\r\nCastlereagh deserves the chief credit, was a permanent addition of\r\n25,000 men to the regular force available for service at home or in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1808, there chanced to be several considerable bodies of\r\ntroops which could be promptly utilized for an expedition to Spain. The\r\nmost important was a corps of some 9,000 men which was being collected\r\nin the south of Ireland, to renew the attack on South America which had\r\nfailed so disastrously in 1807. The news of the Spanish insurrection\r\nhad, of course, led to the abandonment of the design, and General\r\nMiranda, its originator, had been informed that he must look for no\r\nfurther support from England. In addition to this force in Ireland\r\nthere were a couple of brigades in the south-eastern counties of\r\nEngland, which had been intended to form the nucleus of Castlereagh’s\r\nprojected raid on Boulogne. They had been concentrated at Harwich\r\nand Ramsgate respectively, and the transports for them were ready. A\r\nstill more important contingent, but one that lay further off, and was\r\nnot so immediately available, was the corps of 10,000 men which Sir\r\nJohn Moore had taken to the Baltic. In June it became known that it\r\nwas impossible to co-operate with the hairbrained King of Sweden, who\r\nwas bent on invading Russian Finland, a scheme to which the British\r\nMinistry refused its assent. Moore, therefore, after many stormy\r\ninterviews with Gustavus IV, was preparing to bring his division home.\r\nWith the aid of Spencer’s troops, which had so long been hovering about\r\nCadiz and Gibraltar, and of certain regiments picked out of the English\r\ngarrisons, it was easily possible to provide 40,000 men for service in\r\nSpain and Portugal.\r\n\r\nBut a number of isolated brigades and battalions suddenly thrown\r\ntogether do not form an army, and though Castlereagh had provided a\r\nlarge force for the projected expedition to the Peninsula, it was\r\ndestitute of any proper organization. With the expedition that sailed\r\nfrom Cork there was only half a regiment of cavalry, and the brigades\r\nfrom Harwich, Ramsgate, and Gibraltar had not a single horseman with\r\nthem, so that there were actually 18,000 foot to 390 horse among the\r\ncontingents that first disembarked to contend with Junot’s army.\r\nTransport was almost equally neglected: only the troops from Cork had\r\nany military train with them, and that they were provided with horses\r\nand vehicles was only due to the prescience of their commander, who had\r\nat the last moment procured leave from London to enlist for foreign\r\nservice and take with him two troops of the ‘Royal Irish Corps of\r\nWagoners.’ ‘I declare,’ wrote Wellesley, ‘that I do not understand the\r\nprinciples on which our military establishments are formed, if, when\r\nlarge corps are sent out to perform important and difficult services,\r\nthey are not to have with them those means of equipment which they\r\nrequire, such as horses to draw artillery, and drivers attached to\r\nthe commissariat[180].’ Without this wise inspiration, he would have\r\nfound himself unable to move when he arrived in the Peninsula: as it\r\nwas, he had to leave behind, when he landed, some of his guns and half\r\nhis small force of cavalry, because the authorities had chosen to\r\nbelieve that both draft and saddle horses could readily be procured\r\nin Portugal. Such little _contretemps_ were common in the days when\r\nFrederick Duke of York, with the occasional assistance of Mrs. Mary Ann\r\nClark, managed the British army.\r\n\r\n  [180] Wellesley to Castlereagh, June 29, 1808 (_Well. Suppl.\r\n  Disp._, vi. 87).\r\n\r\nBut the arrangements as to the command of the expedition were the\r\nmost ill-managed part of the business. The force at Cork was,\r\nas we have already explained, under the orders of Sir Arthur\r\nWellesley, the younger brother of the great viceroy who had so much\r\nextended our Indian Empire between 1799 and 1805. He was the junior\r\nlieutenant-general in the British army, but had already to his credit\r\na more brilliant series of victories than any other officer then\r\nliving, including the all-important triumph of Assaye, which had so\r\neffectually broken the power of the Mahrattas. In 1808 he was a Member\r\nof Parliament and Under-Secretary for Ireland, but Castlereagh (who\r\nhad the most unbounded belief in his abilities, and had long been\r\nusing his advice on military questions) had picked him out to command\r\nthe expedition mustering at Cork. When its destination was changed\r\nfrom America to Spain, the Secretary for War still hoped to keep him\r\nin command, but the Duke of York and the War Office were against\r\nWellesley[181]. There were many respectable lieutenant-generals of\r\nenormous seniority and powerful connexions who were eager for foreign\r\nservice. None of them had Wellesley’s experience of war on a large\r\nscale, or had ever moved 40,000 men on the field: but this counted for\r\nlittle at head quarters. The command in Portugal was made over to two\r\nof his seniors. The first was Sir Hew Dalrymple, a man of fifty-eight,\r\nwhose only campaigning had been with the Duke of York in Flanders\r\nthirteen years back. He had been Governor of Gibraltar since 1806, knew\r\nsomething of Spanish politics, and was now in active communication with\r\nCastaños. The second in command was to be Sir Harry Burrard[182]: he\r\nwas an old Guards officer who had served during the American rebellion,\r\nand had more recently commanded a division during the Copenhagen\r\nexpedition without any special distinction. The third was Sir John\r\nMoore, and to being superseded by him Wellesley could not reasonably\r\nhave objected. He was at this moment perhaps the most distinguished\r\nofficer in the British service: he had done splendid work in the West\r\nIndies, Egypt, and the Netherlands. He had reorganized the light\r\ninfantry tactics of the British army, and had won the enthusiastic\r\nadmiration of all who had ever served under him for his zeal and\r\nintelligent activity. But Moore, like Wellesley, was to be placed under\r\nDalrymple and Burrard, and not trusted with an independent command. At\r\nthe present moment he was still far away in the Baltic, and was not\r\nexpected to arrive for some time. Meanwhile Wellesley was allowed to\r\nsail in temporary charge of the expeditionary force, and still under\r\nthe impression that he was to retain its guidance. His transports\r\nweighed anchor on July 12, and it was only on July 15 that the dispatch\r\nfrom Downing Street, informing him that he had been superseded by\r\nDalrymple and Burrard, was drafted. It did not reach him till he had\r\nalready landed in Portugal.\r\n\r\n  [181] For hints on this subject see the letter of W. Wellesley\r\n  Pole, a kinsman of Sir Arthur, in _Wellington Supplementary\r\n  Dispatches_ (vi. 171). ‘The desire that has been manifested at\r\n  Head Quarters for active command will render it natural for all\r\n  that has passed to be seen through a false medium.... The object\r\n  of Head Quarters, if it has any object at all, must be to keep\r\n  down the officer for whom the army has the greatest enthusiasm,\r\n  and to prevent him from being called by the voice of the nation\r\n  to the head of the forces upon active service, rather than to\r\n  crush old officers of known incapacity and want of following....\r\n  Dalrymple is a Guardsman; Burrard is a Guardsman; their\r\n  connexions are closely united to Windsor and Whitehall, and for\r\n  years have not only been in the most confidential situation about\r\n  Head Quarters, but have imbibed all their military notions from\r\n  thence;’ &c.\r\n\r\n  [182] Born in 1755, he was a favourite of the Duke of York, and\r\n  had acted as his aide-de-camp. At this moment he held a command\r\n  in the Home District.\r\n\r\nHis political instructions had been forwarded as early as June 30.\r\nThey were drawn up mainly on the data that the Asturian and Galician\r\ndeputations had furnished to the ministry[183]. Both the Juntas had\r\nbeen unwise enough to believe that the national rising would suffice\r\nto expel the French--whose numbers they much underrated--from Spain.\r\nWhile empowering their envoys to ask for money, arms, and stores,\r\nthey had ordered them to decline the offer of an auxiliary force.\r\nThey requested that all available British troops might be directed on\r\nPortugal, in order to rouse an insurrection in that country (which was\r\nstill quiet when they arrived in London), and to prevent the troops\r\nof Junot from being employed against the rear of the army of General\r\nBlake. In deference to their suggestions the British Government had\r\nsent enormous stores of muskets, powder, and equipment to Gihon and\r\nFerrol, but directed Wellesley to confine his activity to Portugal.\r\nThe Spaniards, with their usual inaccuracy, had estimated the total\r\nof Junot’s army at no more than 15,000 men. Misled by this absurd\r\nundervaluation, Castlereagh informed Wellesley that if he found that\r\nhis own and Spencer’s forces sufficed for the reduction of Portugal,\r\nhe might ‘operate against the Tagus’ at once. But if more men were\r\nrequired, an additional 10,000 bayonets would be provided from England,\r\nand the expeditionary force might meanwhile ask the leave of the\r\nGalician Junta to stop at Vigo--a halt which would have cost many weeks\r\nof valuable time. Wellesley himself was to choose a fast-sailing vessel\r\nand make for Corunna, where he was to confer with the Junta and pick up\r\nthe latest information as to the state of affairs in the Peninsula.\r\n\r\n  [183] Castlereagh to Wellington (_Well. Disp._, iv. 8, 9).\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these instructions Sir Arthur preceded the bulk\r\nof his armament on the _Crocodile_, and reached Corunna in the short\r\nspace of eight days [July 20]. He found the Galicians somewhat\r\ndepressed by the disaster of Medina de Rio Seco, whose details they\r\nmisrepresented in the most shameless fashion to their distinguished\r\nvisitor. Bessières, they said, had lost 7,000 men and six guns, and\r\nalthough he had forced Blake and Cuesta to retreat on Benavente,\r\nthose generals had still 40,000 troops under arms, and had no need\r\nof any auxiliary force. ‘The arrival of the British money yesterday\r\nhas entirely renewed their spirits,’ wrote Wellesley, ‘and neither\r\nin them nor in the inhabitants of this town do I see any symptom of\r\nalarm, or doubt of their final success.’ This vainglorious confidence\r\nwas supported by an infinity of false news: Lefebvre-Desnouettes was\r\nsaid to have been thrice defeated near Saragossa, and Dupont and his\r\nwhole corps had been taken prisoners on June 22 in an action between\r\nAndujar and La Carolina--a curious prophecy, for it foresaw and placed\r\na month too early the catastrophe of Baylen[184], which no reasonable\r\nman could have predicted. Almost the only correct information which\r\nwas supplied to Wellesley was the news of the revolt of Oporto and the\r\nrest of Northern Portugal. It was clear that there was now an opening\r\nfor the British army in that country, and as the Galicians continued to\r\ndisplay their reluctance to receive any military aid, Sir Arthur went\r\nto sea again, joined his fleet of transports off Cape Finisterre, and\r\nbade them make for the mouth of the Douro. He himself put into Oporto,\r\nwhere he landed and interviewed the Bishop and the Supreme Junta. He\r\nfound them in no very happy frame of mind: they had, as they confessed,\r\nonly been able to arm 5,000 infantry and 300 cavalry, who lay under\r\nBernardino Freire at Coimbra, and 1,500 men more for a garrison at\r\nOporto. The rest of these levies consisted of 12,000 peasants with\r\npikes, ‘and though the people were ready and desirous to take arms,\r\nunfortunately there were none in the country’--not even enough to equip\r\nthe disbanded regulars. The Bishop expressed himself as much alarmed\r\nat the news of the disaster at Medina de Rio Seco, and his military\r\nadvisers acknowledged that in consequence of that battle they had given\r\nup any hope of aid from Spain[185]. They asked eagerly for arms, of\r\nwhich the English fleet carried many thousand stand, and were anxious\r\nto see Wellesley’s troops landed. The place which they recommended for\r\nputting the army ashore was Mondego Bay, near Coimbra, where the mouth\r\nof the Mondego River furnishes an indifferent harbour, guarded by the\r\nfort of Figueira. That stronghold, it will be remembered, had been\r\nseized by the bold exploit of the student Zagalo; it was now garrisoned\r\nby 300 British marines, so that the disembarkation would be safe from\r\ndisturbance by anything save the heavy Atlantic surf, which always\r\nbeats against the western coast of Portugal. There was no other port\r\navailable along the shore save Peniche, which was dangerously close to\r\nLisbon, and guarded by a castle still in French hands. Nearer still\r\nto the capital, landing is just possible at Cascaes and a few other\r\nplaces: but there was no regular harbour, and Admiral Cotton agreed\r\nwith Wellesley in thinking that it would be mad to attempt to throw\r\ntroops ashore on a dangerous rock-bound coast in the midst of Junot’s\r\ncantonments. Mondego Bay was therefore appointed as the general place\r\nof rendezvous for the fleet, which had now begun to arrive opposite the\r\nmouth of the Douro.\r\n\r\n  [184] Wellesley to Castlereagh, from Corunna, July 21 (_Well.\r\n  Disp._, vi. 23-5).\r\n\r\n  [185] Napier’s statement that Wellesley found the Supreme Junta\r\n  in an extravagant and irrational frame of mind is by no means\r\n  borne out by the dispatches which he sent off from Oporto on\r\n  July 25. They rather represent the Portuguese as in a state of\r\n  pronounced depression of spirits.\r\n\r\nAs to the Portuguese troops, the Supreme Junta agreed that Bernardino\r\nFreire and his 5,000 men should go forward with the British army,\r\nwhile the new levies should blockade Almeida, and guard the frontier\r\nalong the Douro against any possible advance on the part of Marshal\r\nBessières from Castile. The Junta calculated that, if supplied with\r\narms, they could put into the field from the three northern provinces\r\nof Portugal 38,000 foot and 8,000 horse--a liberal estimate, as they\r\nhad, including their peasant levies, no more than 19,000 collected on\r\nJuly 25. They asked for weapons and clothing for the whole mass, and\r\nfor a loan of 300,000 Cruzado Novas (about £35,000)--no very large sum\r\nconsidering the grants that were being made to the Spaniards at this\r\ntime. Wellesley would only promise that he would arm the militia and\r\npeasantry who were lying along the Mondego in company with Freire’s\r\nregulars, ‘if he found them worth it[186].’ The Bishop undertook\r\nto forward from Oporto all the remounts for cavalry and all the\r\ndraught-mules for commissariat purposes that he could get together. He\r\nthought that he could procure 150 of the former and 500 of the latter\r\nin six days.\r\n\r\n  [186] Wellesley to Castlereagh, from Oporto, July 25 (_Well.\r\n  Disp._, vi. 31).\r\n\r\nOn August 1, 1808, the disembarkation in Mondego Bay began, in the\r\nface of a heavy surf which rendered landing very dangerous, especially\r\nfor the horses, guns, and stores. Many boats were upset and a few\r\nlives lost[187]; but the troops and their commander were in good\r\nspirits, for the news of the surrender of Dupont at Baylen on July 20\r\nhad reached them the day before the disembarkation began. Wellesley\r\nwas convinced that General Spencer would have sailed from Andalusia\r\nto join him, the moment that this great victory made the presence of\r\nBritish troops in the south unnecessary. He was right, for Spencer,\r\nbefore receiving any orders to that effect, had embarked his men for\r\nPortugal and came into Mondego Bay on August 5, just as the last of the\r\ndivision from Cork had been placed on shore. It was therefore with some\r\n13,000 men that Wellesley began his march on Lisbon[188]. But to his\r\nbitter disappointment the young lieutenant-general had just learnt that\r\nthree commanders had been placed over his head, and that he might soon\r\nexpect Dalrymple to arrive and assume charge of the army. Castlereagh’s\r\ndispatch of July 15, containing this unwelcome news, was delivered to\r\nWellesley as he lay in Mondego Bay on the thirtieth, and he had to make\r\nall his arrangements for disembarkation while suffering under this\r\nunexpected slight. Many men would have resigned under such a blow, and\r\nWellesley with his unbounded ambition, his strong sense of his deserts,\r\nand his well-marked tendency to take offence[189] must have been\r\nboiling over with suppressed indignation. But he felt that to ask to be\r\nrecalled, because he had been degraded from a commander-in-chief to a\r\nmere general of division, would be an unsoldierly act. To Castlereagh\r\nhe merely wrote that ‘whether he was to command the army or to quit\r\nit, he would do his best to ensure its success, and would not hurry\r\noperations one moment in order to acquire credit before the arrival of\r\nhis superiors[190].’\r\n\r\n  [187] For the difficulties of disembarkation see the interesting\r\n  narrative of Landsheit of the 20th Dragoons, p. 248.

Disp._, ii.\r\n  362) to his own brother concerning his merits, his promotion, and\r\n  his career. The man who could so write must have felt the blow in\r\n  the worst way.\r\n\r\n  [190] _Well. Disp._, iv. 43.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there were yet a few days during which he would retain the\r\ncommand, and it was in his power to start the campaign on the right\r\nlines, even if he was not to reap the reward of its success. His first\r\neight days on shore (August 2-9), were spent in the organization of the\r\ncommissariat of his army, which the Home Government had disgracefully\r\nneglected. Except the two troops of the Irish Wagon Train, which he had\r\ninsisted on bringing with him, he had no transport at his disposal,\r\nand, as he wrote to Castlereagh, ‘the existence of the army depends\r\nupon the commissariat, and yet the people who manage it are incapable\r\nof managing anything out of a counting-house[191].’ All that could\r\nbe got out of the country he utilized: the Bishop of Oporto had sent\r\nhim a few horses which enabled him to raise his force of mounted men\r\nfrom 180 to 240[192], and to give some animals to the artillery[5], to\r\nadd to those that had come from Ireland[193]. But though he succeeded\r\nin equipping his own three batteries, the two which Spencer brought\r\nfrom Andalusia had to be left behind on the Mondego for want of\r\ndraught-horses[194]: the dismounted men of the 20th Dragoons had also\r\nto be dropped. For the commissariat the Bishop of Oporto had sent\r\nsome mules, which were raised to a total of 500 by purchases in the\r\ncountry-side, while 300 bullock-carts were procured for the heavier\r\nstores by requisition from the neighbouring villages. It was only\r\non the ninth that things were so far ready that the army could move\r\nforward. It was now divided into six small brigades under Generals\r\nHill, Ferguson, Nightingale, Bowes, Catlin Crawfurd, and Fane: the\r\nthird, fourth, and fifth brigades had only two battalions each, the\r\nother four had three[195].\r\n\r\n  [191] Ibid., iv. 59; cf. pp. 168, 169.\r\n\r\n  [192] Ibid., iv. 168. Cf. the returns for Vimiero of men present,\r\n  with the 180 horsed men brought from Ireland.\r\n\r\n  [193] Ibid., iv. 168.\r\n\r\n  [194] Ibid., iv. 59.\r\n\r\n  [195] The brigading was as follows:--1st Brigade (Hill), 5th,\r\n  9th, 38th; 2nd Brigade (Ferguson), 36th, 40th, 71st; 3rd Brigade\r\n  (Nightingale), 29th, 82nd; 4th Brigade (Bowes), 6th, 32nd; 5th\r\n  Brigade (C. Crawfurd), 50th, 91st; 6th Brigade (Fane), 45th,\r\n  5/60th, 2/95th. Before Vimiero the 45th and 50th changed places\r\n  (see the narrative of Col. Leach of Fane’s Brigade). It is worth\r\n  noting that six of these sixteen battalions, as also the 20th\r\n  Light Dragoons, had just returned from the disheartening work of\r\n  the Buenos Ayres expedition. They were the 5th, 36th, 38th, 40th,\r\n  45th, and 71st.\r\n\r\nWellesley had resolved to advance by the coast-road on Lisbon, via\r\nAlcobaça, Obidos, and Torres Vedras, and it was along the desolate\r\nshore ‘up to the knees in sand and suffering dreadfully from\r\nthirst[196],’ that his men made their first march of twelve miles to\r\nLugar. The distance was moderate, but the troops had been so long\r\ncramped on shipboard that some of the regiments had fallen out of\r\ncondition and left many stragglers.\r\n\r\n  [196] _Journal of a Soldier of the 71st Regiment_ (Edin. 1828),\r\n  p. 47.\r\n\r\nThe reasons which had determined Wellesley to take the coast route,\r\nrather than that which leads from the Mondego to Lisbon via Santarem,\r\nwere, as he afterwards explained, partly a wish to keep in touch with\r\nthe fleet for the purpose of obtaining supplies--for he found that\r\nthe country could support him in wine and beef, but not in flour--and\r\npartly the fact that he had learnt that new reinforcements from England\r\nwere likely to appear within a few days. The brigades from Harwich and\r\nRamsgate, under Generals Acland and Anstruther, had sailed on July\r\n19 and might be looked for at any moment. Sir John Moore, with the\r\ndivision from Sweden, was also reported to be on his way to the south,\r\nbut could not be expected to arrive for some time. Having ascertained\r\nthat the French force in Portugal was somewhat larger than he\r\noriginally supposed, Sir Arthur wished to pick up the troops of Acland\r\nand Anstruther before giving battle. In this he was even wiser than he\r\nknew, for he still estimated Junot’s total disposable force at 18,000\r\nmen[197], while it was really 26,000. To have attacked Lisbon with no\r\nmore than the 13,000 troops who had originally disembarked at the mouth\r\nof the Mondego would have been most hazardous.\r\n\r\n  [197] Wellesley to Burrard, August 8 (_Well. Disp._, iv. 53).\r\n\r\nWellesley had at first intended to take on with him the whole of\r\nBernardino Freire’s army. He had visited the Portuguese commander at\r\nMontemor Velho on the seventh, and had issued to his ally a supply\r\nof 5,000 muskets. Freire was anxious to persuade him to give up the\r\ncoast route, and to throw himself into the interior on the side of\r\nSantarem. But the cogent reasons which compelled him to prefer the\r\nroad which allowed him to keep in touch with the fleet, made him\r\nrefuse to listen to this plan, and he invited the Portuguese general\r\nto transfer himself on to the same line. Freire so far submitted as to\r\nmove to Leiria, where he met the British army on August 10. But here\r\nthe two commanders came to hard words and parted. Freire, a self-willed\r\nand shifty man, was determined not to act in unison with Wellesley.\r\nWhether he wished to preserve his independent command, or whether he\r\nfeared (as Napier hints) to oppose his raw levies to the French, even\r\nwhen supported by 13,000 British bayonets[198], he now showed himself\r\nutterly impracticable. He began by laying hands on all the stores of\r\nfood in Leiria, though they had been promised to Wellesley. Then he\r\nmade the absurd and impudent statement that he could only co-operate\r\nwith his allies if Wellesley would undertake to provide rations for his\r\n6,000 men. This proposal was all the more astounding because he had\r\njust been trying to persuade his colleague to move into the inland, by\r\nthe statement that resources of every kind abounded in Estremadura, and\r\nthat the whole British army could easily live upon the country-side!\r\nWellesley’s men had now been subsisting for ten days on biscuit landed\r\nby the fleet, and it was ludicrous that he should be asked to take\r\nupon his shoulders the whole burden of feeding the Portuguese in their\r\nown country. Accordingly he utterly rejected the proposal, but he\r\ninsisted that Freire should lend him some cavalry and light troops, and\r\nthese he promised to maintain. The bulk of the Portuguese, therefore,\r\nremained behind at Leiria, their general being left free to take up,\r\nif he should choose, his favourite plan of marching on Santarem. But\r\n260 horsemen--the skeletons of three old cavalry regiments--a battalion\r\nof Cazadores, and three weak line-regiments were placed at Wellesley’s\r\ndisposition: they amounted to about 2,300 men[199], according to the\r\nPortuguese official figures, but the British commander repeatedly\r\nstates that he saw no more than 260 horse and 1,600 infantry[200]; so\r\nit is probable that the regiments were somewhat under the estimate\r\ngiven by Freire. They were commanded by Colonel Trant, a British\r\nofficer in the Portuguese service[201].\r\n\r\n  [198] Napier, i. 197.\r\n\r\n  [199] According to the figures given by the Portuguese historian\r\n  of the war, Da Luz Soriano, they stood as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Cavalry of the 6th, 11th, and 12th Regiments     258 sabres.\r\n    6th battalion of Cazadores                       562 bayonets.\r\n    12th, 21st, and 24th line battalions           1,514    ”\r\n\r\n  A few troopers of the Lisbon Police Guard, forty-one in all,\r\n  according to Soriano, deserted Junot and joined the army\r\n  before Vimiero. Landsheit of the 20th Light Dragoons mentions\r\n  their arrival, and says that they were put in company with his\r\n  regiment. This would give 2,375 as the total of the Portuguese\r\n  whom Trant commanded.\r\n\r\n  [200] _Well. Disp._ (iv. 78) says 1,400, but in his narrative of\r\n  Roliça Sir Arthur accounts for 1,600, 1,200 in his right and 400\r\n  in his centre column. As a middle figure between Wellesley and\r\n  Soriano, 2,000 would probably be safe.\r\n\r\n  [201] Their allies did not think much of their looks. Col. Leslie\r\n  describes them thus: ‘The poor fellows had little or no uniform,\r\n  but were merely in white jackets, and large broad-brimmed hats\r\n  turned up at one side, some having feathers and others none, so\r\n  that they cut rather a grotesque appearance’ (p. 40).\r\n\r\nTurning once more into the road that skirts the coast, Wellesley\r\nmarched on the thirteenth from Leiria, and reached Alcobaça on the\r\nfourteenth. Here he got his first news of the French: a brigade under\r\nThomières had occupied the village till the previous day, and he learnt\r\nthat General Delaborde, with a weak division, was somewhere in his\r\nfront, in the direction of Obidos and Roliça.\r\n\r\nJunot had received prompt information of the landing of the British\r\nin Mondego Bay; on the very day after it had commenced he was able\r\nto send orders to Loison to abandon his post in front of Badajoz and\r\nto march at once to join the main army. Meanwhile Delaborde was sent\r\nout from Lisbon on August 6 to observe and, if possible, contain\r\nWellesley, till Junot should have concentrated his whole field-army\r\nand be ready to fight. He was told to expect Loison from the direction\r\nof Thomar and Santarem, and to join him as soon as was possible. For\r\nhis rather hazardous task he was given no more than five battalions\r\nof infantry and a single regiment of _chasseurs à cheval_, with five\r\nguns[202]--not much more than 5,000 men.\r\n\r\n  [202] Delaborde’s numbers at the combat of Roliça have been the\r\n  cause of much controversy. Wellesley in one of his dispatches\r\n  estimated them at as much as 6,000 men; the unveracious Thiébault\r\n  would reduce them as low as 1,900. But it is possible to arrive\r\n  at something like the real figures.\r\n\r\n  Delaborde brought out from Lisbon two battalions of the 70th, the\r\n  26th _Chasseurs à Cheval_, and five guns. Thomières joined him\r\n  from Peniche with the 1st Provisional Light Infantry (a battalion\r\n  each of the 2nd and 4th Léger) and with the 4th Swiss.\r\n\r\n  The numbers of these corps had been on July 15:--\r\n\r\n    70th of the Line (two batts.)                    2,358\r\n    2nd Léger (one batt.)                            1,075\r\n    4th   ”       ”                                  1,098\r\n    4th Swiss     ”                                    985\r\n    26th Chasseurs                                     263\r\n                                                     -----\r\n                                                     5,779\r\n\r\n  But each of the four French corps had given its grenadier company\r\n  as a contribution to the ‘Reserve Grenadier Battalions’ which\r\n  Junot had organized. The battalions being on the old nine-company\r\n  establishment (see Foy’s large table of the _Armée d’Espagne_,\r\n  note _d_) we must deduct one-ninth of each, or about 500 men\r\n  in all. We have also to allow for six companies of the 4th\r\n  Swiss sent to garrison Peniche; not for the whole battalion,\r\n  as Foy says in iv. 306, for there were Swiss in the fight of\r\n  Roliça (Leslie’s _Military Journal_, p. 43), and at Vimiero\r\n  in the official state of Junot’s army we find two companies\r\n  of this corps with Brennier’s brigade. We must deduct, then,\r\n  three-fourths of them from the force present with Delaborde,\r\n  i.e. some 740 men. This leaves 4,276 men for the four and a\r\n  quarter battalions under fire at Roliça. Of course Junot’s troops\r\n  must have had a few men in hospital since July 15, the date of\r\n  the return which we are using. But they cannot have been many.\r\n  The 70th had been quiet in its quarters in Lisbon. The other\r\n  three battalions had been in Loison’s Beira expedition, and had\r\n  lost some men therein, but all before July 11. If we concede\r\n  300 sick on August 16, it is ample. We can allow therefore for\r\n  4,000 infantry, 250 cavalry, and some 100 gunners present with\r\n  Delaborde, i.e. his total force must have been about 4,350 men--a\r\n  number much closer to Wellesley’s 6,000 than to Thiébault’s\r\n  1,900; Foy, usually so accurate, is clearly wrong in bringing the\r\n  figures down to 2,500 (iv. 310).\r\n\r\nDelaborde at first thought of making a stand, and compelling Wellesley\r\nto show his force, at Batalha near Alcobaça, where John I had beaten\r\nthe Spaniards, four and a half centuries ago, at the decisive battle\r\nof Aljubarotta. But, after examining the position, he found it so much\r\nsurrounded by woods, and so destitute of good points of view, that he\r\nfeared to be enveloped if he committed himself to a fight. Accordingly\r\nhe drew back to Roliça, leaving only a rearguard at Obidos to observe\r\nthe approach of the British. At the same time he detached six companies\r\nof the 4th Swiss to garrison Peniche, thus reducing his available force\r\nto 4,350 men.\r\n\r\nWellesley, meanwhile, knowing himself to be close to the enemy,\r\nadvanced steadily but with caution. He left behind his tents and other\r\nweighty baggage at Leiria, and moved forward with a lightly equipped\r\narmy to Alcobaça on the fourteenth, to Caldas on the fifteenth. On that\r\nday the first shot of the campaign was fired: four companies of the\r\nfifth battalion of the 60th and of the second battalion of the 95th\r\nRifles discovered the French outposts at Brilos in front of Obidos,\r\ndrove them in, and pursuing furiously for three miles, came on the\r\nbattalion which formed Delaborde’s rearguard. This corps turned upon\r\nthem, checked them with the loss of two[203] officers and twenty-seven\r\nmen killed and wounded, and only retired when General Spencer led up a\r\nbrigade to save the riflemen.\r\n\r\n  [203] The name of Lieutenant Bunbury, of the 2/95th, perhaps\r\n  deserves remembrance as that of the first British officer killed\r\n  in the Peninsular War.\r\n\r\nNext morning the French were discovered to have fallen back no further\r\nthan Roliça, where Delaborde had found the position that he had sought\r\nin vain at Batalha. The road from Caldas and Obidos towards Torres\r\nVedras and Lisbon passes for some miles over a sandy plain enclosed\r\non either flank by bold hills. The southern limit of the basin is a\r\ncross-ridge, which connects the other two: in front of it lies Roliça,\r\non the side-slope of an isolated eminence which overlooks the whole\r\nplain: a mile further south the road passes over the cross-ridge by\r\na sort of gorge or defile, on the right hand of which is the village\r\nof Columbeira, while to its left rear lies that of Zambugeira. Though\r\nDelaborde had drawn up his men on the hill of Roliça down in the plain,\r\nit was not this advanced position that he intended to hold, but the\r\nhigher and steeper line of the cross-ridge, on either side of the\r\ndefile above Columbeira. Here he had a short front, only three-quarters\r\nof a mile in length, scarped by precipitous slopes, and covered by\r\nthickets and brushwood, which served to mask the strength (or rather\r\nthe weakness) of his division.\r\n\r\nDiscovering Delaborde drawn up on the isolated hill of Roliça,\r\nwhere both his flanks could easily be turned, the British commander\r\nresolved to endeavour to envelop and surround him. He waited on the\r\nsixteenth till the rear of the army had come up, and marched at dawn\r\non the seventeenth with his whole force--13,000 British and 2,000\r\nPortuguese, drawn up in a crescent-shaped formation with the centre\r\nrefused and the wings thrown far forward. On the right Colonel Trant,\r\nwith three battalions of Portuguese infantry and fifty horse of the\r\nsame nation, moved along the foot of the western range of heights,\r\nto turn the Roliça position by a wide circular movement. On the left\r\nGeneral Ferguson, with his own brigade, that of Bowes, and six guns,\r\nstruck over the hills to get round the eastern flank of the French.\r\nIn the centre the remainder of the army--four brigades of British\r\ninfantry, 400 cavalry, half English and half Portuguese, with the\r\nbattalion of Cazadores and twelve guns, advanced on a broad front in\r\ntwo lines, forming a most magnificent spectacle: ‘they came on slowly\r\nbut in beautiful order, dressing at intervals to correct the gaps\r\ncaused by the inequalities of ground, and all converging on the hill\r\nof Roliça[204].’ Hill’s brigade formed the right, Fane’s the left,\r\nNightingale’s the centre, while Catlin Crawfurd’s two battalions and\r\nthe Cazadores acted as the reserve.\r\n\r\n  [204] Foy, iv. 309.\r\n\r\nDelaborde had warned his men to be ready for a sudden rush to the rear\r\nthe minute that the enveloping movement should grow dangerous. Waiting\r\ntill the last possible moment, when Fane’s riflemen were already\r\nengaged with his tirailleurs, and Trant and Ferguson were showing on\r\nthe flanks, he suddenly gave the order for retreat. His men hurried\r\nback, easily eluding the snare, and took post on the wooded heights\r\nabove Columbeira a mile to the rear. Wellesley had to rearrange his\r\ntroops for an attack on the second position, and half the morning had\r\nbeen wasted to no effect. He resolved, however, to repeat his original\r\nmanœuvre. Trant and the Portuguese once more made a long sweep to\r\nthe right: Ferguson’s column mounted the foot-hills of the Sierra de\r\nBaragueda and commenced a toilsome detour to the left[205]. In the\r\ncentre two batteries formed up near a windmill on the northern slope\r\nof Roliça hill and began to bombard the French position, while Fane’s\r\nbrigade to the left on the main road, and Hill’s and Nightingale’s to\r\nthe right deployed for the attack.\r\n\r\n  [205] I cannot find the authority for Napier’s statement that\r\n  Fane joined Ferguson in the second move. He seems still to have\r\n  acted in the centre.\r\n\r\nWellesley had not intended to assault the Columbeira heights till the\r\nturning movements of Trant and Ferguson should be well developed. But,\r\ncontrary to his intention, part of his centre pushed forward at once,\r\nand when it was engaged the other troops in the front line were sent\r\nup to its aid. The face of the hill was scarred by four ‘passes’ as\r\nWellesley called them, or rather large ravines, up each of which some\r\nof the British troops tried to penetrate. On the extreme right the\r\nlight companies of Hill’s brigade, supported by the first battalion\r\nof the 5th Regiment from the same brigade, delivered their attack up\r\none gully. The second pass, just beyond the village of Columbeira, was\r\nassayed by the 29th from Nightingale’s brigade, with the 9th of Hill’s\r\nin support. The 82nd went towards the centre, while Fane’s two rifle\r\nbattalions and the 45th tried the heights far to the left.\r\n\r\nThe 29th Regiment, urged on by the rash courage of its colonel, Lake,\r\nattacked some time before any other corps was engaged. It pushed up a\r\nnarrow craggy pass, the bed of a dried-up mountain torrent, where in\r\nsome places only two or three men abreast could keep their footing: the\r\nfurther that the battalion advanced, the more did the ravine recede\r\ninto the centre of the enemy, and the 29th was soon being fired on\r\nfrom three sides. The right wing, which led, at last forced its way\r\nto the brow of the hill, and was able to deploy in a more or less\r\nimperfect way, and to commence its fire. In front of it were the few\r\ncompanies of the 4th Swiss, some of whom tried to surrender, calling\r\nout that they were friends, turning up their musket butts, and rushing\r\nin to shake hands with the British[206]. But before the 29th could\r\nfully recover its formation, it was fiercely charged from the rear:\r\nsome of the French troops on the lower slopes of the position, finding\r\nthemselves likely to be cut off, formed in a dense mass and rushed\r\nstraight through the right wing of Colonel Lake’s regiment from behind,\r\nbreaking it, killing its commander and capturing six officers and some\r\nthirty of its rank and file, whom they took back with them in triumph.\r\nThe 29th reeled down the slope into a wood, where it reformed on its\r\ncomparatively intact left wing, and then resumed the fight, aided by\r\nthe 9th, its supporting regiment. About this moment the 5th and Fane’s\r\nrifles made other attacks on the two ends of the hostile line, but were\r\nat first checked. Delaborde and his brigadier, Brennier, had only\r\nfour battalions on the ridge, as they had detached three companies of\r\nthe 70th far to their right in the direction in which Ferguson was\r\nmoving. But they held their ground very gallantly, waiting till the\r\nBritish skirmishers had begun to get a lodgement on the brow, and then\r\ncharging each detachment as it tried to deploy, and forcing it down to\r\nthe edge of the wood that covered the lower slopes. Three assaults were\r\nthus repulsed, but the British troops would not be denied--Wellesley\r\nwrote that he had never seen more gallant fighting than that of the 9th\r\nand the 29th[207]--and after each reverse formed up again and came on\r\nonce more. After two hours of desperate struggles they made good their\r\nlodgement on the crest at several points: Ferguson’s troops (though\r\nthey had lost their way and wasted much time) began to appear on the\r\nextreme left, and Delaborde then saw that it was time for him to go.\r\n\r\n  [206] Col. Leslie’s narrative, p. 43. The 4th Swiss was a very\r\n  discontented corps; individuals of it had begun to desert to the\r\n  British even before Roliça (Leach, p. 44), and a considerable\r\n  number of them took service in the 60th Rifles after the\r\n  Convention of Cintra, refusing to return to France.\r\n\r\n  [207] _Well. Disp._, iv. 83, 87.\r\n\r\nHe retired by alternate battalions, two in turn holding back the\r\ndisordered pursuers, while the other two doubled to the rear. His\r\nregiment of _chasseurs à cheval_ also executed several partial charges\r\nagainst the British skirmishers, and lost its commander mortally\r\nwounded: the Portuguese cavalry refused to face them. In this way the\r\nFrench reached the pass behind Zambugeira, a mile to the rear, without\r\nany great loss. But in passing through this defile, they were forced to\r\nclub together by the narrowness of the road, were roughly hustled by\r\ntheir pursuers, and lost three[208] of their guns and a few prisoners.\r\nThe rest of the force escaped in some disorder to Cazal da Sprega,\r\nwhere Wellesley halted his men, seeing that it was now impossible to\r\ncatch Delaborde’s main body. Two miles to the rear the French were\r\nrejoined by the three companies of the 70th Regiment which had been\r\ndetached to the east. They then retreated to Montechique some fifteen\r\nmiles from Lisbon, where they at last got news of Loison and Junot.\r\n\r\n  [208] Foy says only one gun, but Wellesley, who had better\r\n  opportunities of knowing, says that he took three (_Well. Disp._,\r\n  iv. 83).\r\n\r\nDelaborde had fought a most admirable rearguard action, holding on to\r\nthe last moment, and escaping by his prompt manœuvres the very serious\r\nrisk of being enveloped and captured by the forces of the English,\r\nwho outnumbered him fourfold. But he had lost 600 men and three guns,\r\nwhile his assailants had only suffered to the extent of 474 killed,\r\nwounded, and prisoners[209], nearly half of whom were in the ranks of\r\nthe 29th[210]. The French flattered themselves that they had somewhat\r\nshaken the _morale_ of Wellesley’s men by their obstinate resistance:\r\nbut this was far from being the case. The English had only put five and\r\na half battalions[211] into the fighting line, and were proud of having\r\nturned the enemy out of such a position as that of Columbeira without\r\nengaging more than 4,600 men.\r\n\r\n  [209] Thiébault solemnly states our loss at 2,000 men!\r\n  _Mémoires_, iv. 186.\r\n\r\n  [210] That corps lost no less than 190 officers and men, among\r\n  whom were six officers taken prisoners.\r\n\r\n  [211] The 5th, 9th, 29th, 82nd, 5/60th, and four companies of the\r\n  2/95th, in all 4,635 men. They lost respectively 46, 72, 190, 25,\r\n  66, and 42 men, or 441 in all; while the rest of the army (ten\r\n  British and four Portuguese battalions) only lost the remaining\r\n  38 of the total of 479 casualties suffered on the 17th, i.e. were\r\n  not really engaged.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether Delaborde should have fought at all: he was\r\nholding on in the hope that Loison’s division would come up and join\r\nhim, but this junction was very problematical, as nothing had been\r\nheard of that general for many days. By fighting at Columbeira,\r\nDelaborde risked complete destruction for an inadequate end. It was\r\ntrue that if Loison was now close at hand Wellesley’s further advance\r\nmight cut him off from Lisbon. But as a matter of fact Loison was still\r\nfar away. He had reached Santarem on August 13, with his troops so\r\ntired by his long march from the Alemtejo, that he halted there for\r\ntwo days to rest them and allow his stragglers to come up. Marching\r\nagain on the sixteenth, he was at Cercal, fifteen miles from Roliça to\r\nthe east, while Delaborde was fighting. He barely heard the distant\r\ncannonade, and rejoined the rest of the army at Torres Vedras, by a\r\nroute through Cadaval and Quinta da Bugagliera, which crossed his\r\ncolleague’s line of retreat at an acute angle [August 18].\r\n\r\nIt is true that if Wellesley had been accurately informed of Loison’s\r\nposition on the seventeenth, he could have so manœuvred as to place\r\nhimself directly between that general and Lisbon on the following\r\nday, by seizing the cross-roads at Quinta da Bugagliera. In that case\r\nLoison’s division could only have rejoined Junot by a perilous flank\r\nmarch through Villafranca and Saccavem, or by crossing the Tagus and\r\nmoving along its eastern bank to the heights of Almada opposite the\r\ncapital. But the English general’s object at this moment was not to\r\ncut off Loison, but to pick up a considerable reinforcement, of\r\nwhose approach he had just heard. On the morning of the eighteenth\r\nthe brigade of General Acland from Harwich had arrived off the\r\nPeniche peninsula, and its advent was reported to Wellesley, with the\r\nadditional news that that of General Anstruther, which had sailed from\r\nRamsgate, was close behind. It was all-important to get these 4,000 men\r\nashore: they could not be landed at Peniche, whose fort was still in\r\nFrench hands, and the only other anchorage near was that of Porto Novo,\r\nat the mouth of the little river Maceira, twelve miles south of Roliça.\r\nTo cover their disembarkation Wellesley marched by the coast-road\r\nthrough Lourinhão, and encamped on the heights of Vimiero. This\r\nmovement allowed Loison, who moved by the parallel road more inland, to\r\npass the English and reach Torres Vedras.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nBy far the best English account of Roliça is that by Col.\r\nLeslie of the 29th, in his _Military Journal_, which was not\r\nprinted till 1887 (at the Aberdeen University Press). He\r\ncorrects Napier on several points. I have also found useful\r\ndetails in the letters (unpublished) of Major Gell, of the\r\nsame regiment, which were placed at my disposition by Mr. P.\r\nLyttelton Gell. Leslie and Gell agree that Colonel Lake led on\r\nhis regiment too fast, contrary to Wellesley’s intentions. The\r\nnarrative of Colonel Leach of the 2/95th is also valuable. The\r\naccounts of Landsheit of the 20th Light Dragoons, of Colonel\r\nWilkie in Maxwell’s _Peninsular Sketches_ (vol. i), and the\r\nanonymous ‘T.S.’ of the 71st (Constable, Edinburgh, 1828) have\r\nsome useful points. Foy and Thiébault, the French narrators of\r\nthe fight, were not eye-witnesses, like the six above-named\r\nBritish writers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nVIMIERO\r\n\r\n\r\nJunot much disliked leaving Lisbon: he greatly enjoyed his viceregal\r\nstate, and was so convinced that to retain the capital was equivalent\r\nto dominating the whole of Portugal[212], that he attached an\r\nexaggerated importance to his hold on the place, and was very\r\nreluctant to cut down its garrison. But it was clearly necessary to\r\nsupport Delaborde and Loison, and at last he took his departure. As\r\na preliminary precaution he resolved to deal a blow at the Alemtejo\r\ninsurgents, who, emboldened by Loison’s retreat, were creeping nearer\r\nto the mouth of the Tagus, and showing themselves opposite Setuval.\r\nOn August 11, five days after Delaborde had marched off, General\r\nKellermann was sent out with two battalions and a few dragoons to drive\r\noff these hovering bands, a task which he executed with ease, giving\r\nthem a thorough beating at Alcacer do Sal. Having cleared this flank\r\nJunot evacuated Setuval and his other outlying posts beyond the Tagus,\r\nand only retained garrisons at Forts Bugio and Trafaria, which command\r\nthe entrance of the river, and on the heights of Almada, which face\r\nLisbon across the ‘Mar de Palio.’ He put in a state of defence the old\r\ncitadel which crowns the highest of the seven hills on which the city\r\nis built, and established a battalion in each of the suburban villages\r\nof Belem and Saccavem, another in Fort San Julian at the mouth of the\r\nTagus, and two at Cascaes, in the batteries which command the only\r\npoint where a disembarkation from the side of the Atlantic is barely\r\npossible. This excess of precaution was largely due to the fact that\r\na small English convoy of transports, carrying the 3rd Regiment (the\r\nBuffs) from Madeira, had been seen off the mouth of the Tagus. The duke\r\nfeared that this portended an attempt to throw troops ashore in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the capital, when he should have gone off to meet\r\nWellesley.\r\n\r\n  [212] As Foy well puts it, the idea was that ‘le Portugal était\r\n  dans Lisbonne, et Lisbonne était à elle seule tout le Portugal’\r\n  (iv. 283).\r\n\r\nAltogether Junot left seven battalions, not less than 6,500 men, in\r\nLisbon and the neighbouring forts, a much greater number than was\r\nreally required, for, as Napoleon afterwards observed, capitals wait,\r\nbefore declaring themselves, for events outside to cast their shadows\r\nbefore[213]. Knowing that a decisive blow given to the English would be\r\nthe best way to keep the city quiet, the Duke of Abrantes would have\r\nbeen wise to cut down his garrisons round Lisbon to 3,000 men, however\r\ngreat the risk, and take every available man to meet Wellesley[214].\r\nIt is probable that his error, which no French general would have\r\ncommitted at a later period of the war, was due to that tendency to\r\ndespise the fighting power of the British which was prevalent on the\r\nContinent all through the early years of the century.\r\n\r\n  [213] See his curious criticism on Junot, recorded by Thiébault\r\n  in iv. 268, 269 of his _Mémoires_.\r\n\r\n  [214] For clearness it may be worth while to give the dislocation\r\n  of Junot’s army on the day of the battle of Vimiero, adding the\r\n  force of each unit on July 15, the last available return.\r\n\r\n  1st Division, Delaborde:--\r\n\r\n    Brigade Avril:                _Men._           _Station._\r\n      15th Line (3rd batt.)       1,086  At Saccavem and in Lisbon city.\r\n      47th  ” (2nd batt.)         1,541  In forts south of the Tagus-mouth.\r\n      70th  ” (1st and 2nd\r\n        batts.)                   2,358  Field-army.

The Russian had refused to take part in the war as long\r\nas only Portuguese were in the field, on the plea that his master\r\nhad never declared war on the Prince-Regent or recognized the French\r\nannexation. But when the British had landed, Junot hoped to move him to\r\naction, for there was no doubt that Russia and the United Kingdom were\r\ntechnically at war. The Duke of Abrantes first tried to induce Siniavin\r\nto put out from the Tagus, to fall upon scattered British convoys, and\r\nto distract the attention of the blockading squadron under Cotton.\r\nBut the reply that to sally forth into the Atlantic would probably\r\nmean destruction in two days by the British fleet was too rational to\r\nbe overruled. Then Junot proposed that Siniavin should at least take\r\ncharge of the pontoons containing the captive Spanish division of\r\nCaraffa: but this too was denied him, and he had to leave a battalion\r\nof Graindorge’s brigade to mount guard on the prisoners[215]. The\r\nRussians were perfectly useless to Junot, except in so far as their\r\nguns helped to overawe Lisbon, and presented a show of force to deter\r\nBritish vessels from trying to force the passage of the forts at the\r\nmouth of the Tagus. The fact was that Siniavin was not so much stupid\r\nas disaffected: he belonged to the party in Russia which was opposed to\r\nFrance, and he had perhaps received a hint from home that he was not\r\nexpected to show too much zeal in supporting the projects of Napoleon.\r\n\r\n  [215] I cannot make out whether this was the 31st or the 32nd\r\n  Léger. Foy and Thiébault omit to give the detail.\r\n\r\nOn the night of August 15, Junot marched out of Lisbon at the head\r\nof his reserve, a very small force consisting of a battalion of the\r\n82nd of the line, one of the two regiments of grenadiers, which he had\r\ncreated by concentrating the grenadier companies of the eighteen line\r\nbattalions in his army[216], the 3rd provisional regiment of dragoons,\r\na squadron of volunteer cavalry formed by the French inhabitants of\r\nLisbon, and his reserve artillery--ten guns under General Taviel. He\r\nalso took with him the reserve ammunition-train, a large convoy of\r\nfood, and his military chest containing a million of francs in specie.\r\nOn the morning of the seventeenth the troops had reached Villafranca,\r\nwhen a false report that the English were trying to land at Cascaes\r\ncaused them to retrace their steps for some miles, and to lose half a\r\nday’s march. On learning that Lisbon and its neighbourhood were quiet,\r\nJunot returned to the front, and growing vexed at the slow march of\r\nthe great convoy which the reserve was escorting, pushed on ahead, and\r\njoined Loison at Cercal. He heard the distant thunder of the guns at\r\nRoliça in the afternoon, but was too far away to help Delaborde.\r\n\r\n  [216] Junot had created two of these regiments of grenadiers,\r\n  each of two battalions. The second was at this moment with Loison.\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth Loison and Junot marched southward to Torres Vedras,\r\nand heard that Delaborde had fallen back so far that he was ten miles\r\nto their rear, at Montechique. He only came up to join them next day\r\n[August 19], and the reserve with its heavy convoy, much hampered by\r\nbad country roads in the Monte Junto hills, did not appear till the\r\ntwentieth.\r\n\r\nJunot had been much exercised in mind by the doubt whether Wellesley\r\nwould march by the direct road on Lisbon through Torres Vedras and\r\nMontechique, or would continue to hug the shore by the longer route\r\nthat passes by Vimiero and Mafra. Not knowing of the approach of\r\nAcland’s and Anstruther’s brigades, he was ignorant of the main fact\r\nwhich governed his adversary’s movements. But learning on the twentieth\r\nthat the British were still keeping to the coast-road, by which\r\nthey could in one more march turn his position at Torres Vedras, he\r\ndetermined to rush upon them with his united forces and give battle.\r\nAt the last moment he resolved to draw a few more men from Lisbon, and\r\ncalled up a battalion of the 66th of the line, and another composed of\r\nfour picked companies selected from the other corps of the garrison--a\r\ntrifling reinforcement of 1,000 or 1,200 men, which arrived just too\r\nlate for the fight at Vimiero.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the French army had been so much cut up by the\r\nnumerous garrisons which Junot had thought fit to leave behind\r\nhim, that although five of his six infantry brigades were more or\r\nless represented in his field-army, not one of them was complete.\r\nHe accordingly recast the whole system, and arranged his force in\r\ntwo divisions under Delaborde and Loison, and a reserve brigade of\r\nGrenadiers under Kellermann. His cavalry on the other hand was intact:\r\nevery one of the four regiments of Margaron’s division was present, and\r\nover and above them he had the squadron of French volunteers raised\r\nin Lisbon. He had also twenty-three guns: there should have been\r\ntwenty-six, but Delaborde had lost three at Roliça. The total of men\r\npresent amounted to 10,300 foot and 2,000 horse, with 700 artillerymen\r\nand men of the military train[217], or about 13,000 in all.\r\n\r\n  [217] Junot’s numbers at Vimiero are as much disputed as\r\n  Delaborde’s at Roliça. Among the French accounts the figures\r\n  vary from 12,500 to 9,200. Foy, usually the most conscientious\r\n  historian, gives 11,500; Thiébault, both in his narrative,\r\n  published in 1816, and in his private _Mémoires_, descends to\r\n  9,200. Wellesley estimated the army that he had fought at 14,000\r\n  (_Well. Disp._, iv. 101).\r\n\r\n  It will be well to give the corps present, and to examine into\r\n  their probable strength. Just before the landing of the British\r\n  they had stood as follows (I have arranged them in their new\r\n  brigading):--\r\n\r\n  (1) Division Delaborde:--\r\n\r\n      Brigade Brennier:\r\n          2nd Léger (3rd batt.)                     1,075\r\n          4th    ”      ”                           1,098\r\n          70th of the Line (1st and 2nd batts.)     2,358\r\n                                                    -----    4,531\r\n\r\n      Brigade Thomières:\r\n        86th of the Line (1st and 2nd batts.)(minus\r\n            four companies left at Elvas)           1,945\r\n        4th Swiss (two companies)                     246\r\n                                                    -----    2,191\r\n\r\n  (2) Division Loison:--\r\n\r\n    Brigade Solignac:\r\n        12th Léger (3rd batt.)                      1,253\r\n        15th    ”       ”                           1,305\r\n        58th of the Line (3rd batt.)                1,428\r\n                                                    -----    3,986\r\n\r\n    Brigade Charlot:\r\n        32nd of the Line (3rd batt.)                1,034\r\n        82nd  ”              ”                        963\r\n                                                    -----    1,997\r\n                                                            ------\r\n                                                            12,705\r\n\r\n  [(3) Reserve of Grenadiers:--\r\n\r\n         1st Regiment (1st and 2nd batts.) }\r\n         2nd     ”           ”      ”      }  2,100\r\n\r\n  This corps, being formed of companies drawn from every battalion\r\n  in Portugal, except the three foreign regiments and the _Légion\r\n  du Midi_, must not be counted in our first estimate.]\r\n\r\n  (4) Cavalry Division Margaron:--\r\n        1st Provisional Chasseurs                     263\r\n        3rd     ”       Dragoons                      640\r\n        4th     ”          ”                          589\r\n        5th     ”          ”                          659\r\n        Squadron of volunteer cavalry                 100\r\n                                                    -----    2,251\r\n\r\n  (5) Artillerymen for 23 guns, engineers, train, &            700\r\n                                                            ------\r\n                                                            15,656\r\n\r\n  But from this 15,656 large deductions have to be made; each of the\r\n  eleven line battalions present had given its grenadier company to\r\n  contribute to the four battalions of ‘Reserve Grenadiers’ which Junot\r\n  had formed. We must therefore deduct from them about 1,350 bayonets.\r\n  Delaborde had lost 600 men at Roliça. Loison’s regiments had been\r\n  thinned by the dépôt battalion left to garrison Almeida, and by his\r\n  losses in his campaign on the Douro and in the Alemtejo. Thiébault\r\n  states that the casualties had amounted to 450 during these operations:\r\n  the details left at Almeida, including many sick, were 1,000 strong,\r\n  so we must subtract 1,450 from Loison’s total. This is liberal, as\r\n  some, both of the Almeida force and of the Alemtejo losses, came from\r\n  regiments not present at Vimiero (e.g. the 1st Hanoverians and the 4th\r\n  Swiss).\r\n\r\n  We must make some deduction for the ordinary hospital wastage of the\r\n  troops which had come out of Lisbon with Delaborde and Junot, seven\r\n  battalions and two regiments of cavalry. Loison’s sick are already\r\n  partly accounted for by the Almeida details. It would seem that 1,000\r\n  would be an ample allowance. When the French evacuated Portugal they\r\n  had 3,281 men in hospital. Of these, 1,200 were the wounded of Vimiero.\r\n  Of the remainder, 1,000 may have belonged to the ten and two-thirds\r\n  battalions present at the battle, the other 1,081 to the eleven and\r\n  one-third not present.\r\n\r\n  For the infantry then we allow--\r\n\r\n    12,705 of original strength, minus 1,350 Grenadiers,\r\n      600 lost at Roliça, and 1,450 in garrison at Almeida\r\n      or lost in the insurrection, and 1,000 sick (4,400\r\n      in all)                                                8,305\r\n    Add for four battalions of Reserve Grenadiers            2,100\r\n                                                            ------\r\n                                           Total            10,405\r\n\r\n    Margaron’s cavalry was practically intact: on July 15\r\n      it was 2,151 strong (Thiébault); it hardly suffered\r\n      in the insurrection. If we allow 300 men for casual\r\n      losses and troopers on detachment or acting as\r\n      orderlies, it is ample                                 1,851\r\n    We must add the 100 volunteer horse                        100\r\n    Lastly, for artillerymen of four batteries (23 guns),\r\n      engineers and train, &c., we allow                       700\r\n                                                            ------\r\n                                           Total            13,056\r\n\r\n  This is not far from Wellesley’s estimate of 14,000 men.\r\n\r\nHearing that Wellesley was stationary in Vimiero since the morning\r\nof the nineteenth, Junot determined to attack him at the earliest\r\npossible moment. He was ignorant that his adversary’s halt was due to\r\nthe arrival of Anstruther and Acland, but knowing that more troops were\r\nexpected from the sea he resolved to fight at once. The reserve and\r\nconvoy joined him on the morning of the twentieth: the same night he\r\nmarched under cover of the darkness and traversed the ten miles which\r\nseparated him from the hostile position: at dawn he was close under it.\r\n\r\nBut Wellesley meanwhile had received his reinforcements, and was\r\n4,000 men stronger than the Duke of Abrantes supposed. On the\r\nnineteenth Anstruther’s[218] brigade had accomplished its dangerous\r\ndisembarkation, through the surf that beats upon the sandy shore north\r\nof the mouth of the Maceira. It had been a tedious business, many\r\nboats having been upset and some lives lost. On the afternoon of the\r\ntwentieth the convoy that brought Acland’s brigade was got inshore, and\r\nthe greater part of the men disembarked in the dusk in the actual mouth\r\nof the little river, and slept upon the beach. But some of them were\r\nstill on shipboard on the morning of the twenty-first, and came too\r\nlate for the battle of that day[219].\r\n\r\n  [218] Anstruther’s Brigade from Ramsgate consisted of--\r\n\r\n          9th Regiment (2nd batt.)            633\r\n          43rd    ”        ”                  721\r\n          52nd    ”        ”                  654\r\n          97th    ”                           695\r\n                                            -----\r\n                                            2,703\r\n\r\n  With them the 43rd and 52nd, so famous in many a Peninsular\r\n  battle-field in the Light Division, made their appearance.\r\n\r\n  [219] Of Acland’s Brigade from Harwich there disembarked--\r\n\r\n  2nd or Queen’s Regiment                     731\r\n  20th Regiment (seven and a half companies)  401\r\n  95th Rifles (1st batt., two companies)      200\r\n                                            -----\r\n                                            1,332\r\n\r\n  The ship that bore Colonel Ross and two and a half companies of\r\n  the 20th had drifted so far off the shore that it did not succeed\r\n  in getting its freight delivered till late on the twenty-first.\r\n\r\nWhile covering this disembarkation Wellesley had taken up an excellent\r\nposition on the heights of Vimiero, with the sea at his back. The\r\nsurrounding country was pleasant, good water was forthcoming in\r\nabundance, and the neighbouring villages provided a considerable\r\nquantity of food. The region is both more fertile and better wooded\r\nthan most of central Portugal. The only fault of the position was\r\nthat it was one from which retreat would have been very difficult. But\r\nconfident in himself and his men, and somewhat under-estimating the\r\npossible maximum of force that Junot could bring against him, Wellesley\r\nwas thinking of nothing less than of retreat. If he had not been\r\nattacked on the twenty-first, he would himself have pushed on towards\r\nthe enemy next day. He had now 16,778 British troops, besides Trant’s\r\n2,000 Portuguese, and thought himself competent to cope with any force\r\nthat Junot could collect.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Battle of Vimiero. August 21, 1808.]\r\n\r\nThe position of Vimiero consists of a well-marked line of heights\r\nsweeping from the north to the south-west, and cut through the centre\r\nby the narrow valley of the river Maceira, on which the village of\r\nVimiero stands. The southern part of the range, which lies nearest the\r\nsea, is especially steep and formidable: the northern part, beyond the\r\nMaceira, is lower and broader: along its ridge runs a country road\r\nleading northward to Lourinhão. But even here the position is very\r\nstrong, for a ravine creeps along its eastern foot and acts as a sort\r\nof ditch to the broad ridge, or rather plateau, which the British army\r\nwas holding. Its only accessible side is the north, where it sinks\r\ndown into a rolling upland beyond the village of Ventosa. In the very\r\ncentre of the position, well in front of the main ridge, just above the\r\nvillage of Vimiero, lies an isolated hill, well suited to serve as an\r\noutwork or first line of defence. It was partly occupied by vineyards\r\nand thickets, partly by open fields, and gave admirable cover for its\r\ndefenders.\r\n\r\nThis hill Wellesley had chosen as the key of his position: on it were\r\nplaced the two brigades of Fane and Anstruther, seven battalions in\r\nall. The high ridge running from behind it to the sea was held by the\r\nbrigades of Hill, Bowes, Catlin Crawfurd, Nightingale, and Acland.\r\nThat of Ferguson lay behind Vimiero, astride of the valley of the\r\nMaceira. Trant’s four battalions of Portuguese were near Ferguson, on\r\nthe lower heights north of Vimiero, ready to act as a reserve to Fane\r\nand Anstruther. The handful of cavalry, 240 English and 260 Portuguese\r\nsabres, were in the low ground on the banks of the Maceira, close under\r\nCrawfurd’s position. Of the three batteries which Wellesley had been\r\nable to bring with him, six guns were on the projecting height with\r\nAnstruther, eight were on the high mountain south of Vimiero, and four\r\nwere with the reserve.\r\n\r\nA glance at this order of battle shows that Wellesley expected to be\r\nattacked from the south, up the valley of the Maceira, and that he\r\nthought that the enemy’s plan would be to force his right-centre.\r\nLittle or no provision is made against the plan which Junot actually\r\nadopted, that of assaulting the British left-centre and simultaneously\r\nturning their extreme left flank, while leaving the right unmolested.\r\nBut the whole position was so short--it was less than three miles in\r\nlength--that there was no difficulty in shifting troops rapidly from\r\none end of it to the other, and, as the event showed, no risk whatever\r\nwas run.\r\n\r\nWellesley was busy arranging his line of battle, when to his bitter\r\ndisappointment he received the news that he was superseded, a calamity\r\nwhich he had been expecting to occur at any moment. Sir Harry Burrard\r\nhad arrived from England at the tail of Acland’s convoy, and was now on\r\nboard the sloop _Brazen_ in Maceira Bay. Sir Arthur at once went off\r\nin a boat to greet him, and to give him an account of the condition in\r\nwhich affairs stood. Burrard heard him out, and then placed a strong\r\nembargo on any further offensive movement. He had learnt that Sir John\r\nMoore, with the division from the Baltic, was now off the Portuguese\r\ncoast, and was resolved not to stir till those troops should have been\r\nlanded. Being, as it seems, a leisurely sort of man, he resolved to\r\nsleep on board his ship for one night more, and to come ashore next\r\nmorning--a resolve which cost him that chance of commanding a British\r\narmy in a pitched battle which so many generals have in vain desired.\r\nWellesley went back through the surf charged, for a short fifteen hours\r\nmore, with the destinies of the army of Portugal[220].\r\n\r\n  [220] It may be well to give Wellesley’s army at Vimiero:--\r\n\r\n              Cavalry, 20th Light Dragoons                  240\r\n              Artillery, three batteries                    226\r\n\r\n          1st Brigade, Hill:\r\n              5th (1st batt.)                     944\r\n              9th      ”                          761\r\n              38th     ”                          953\r\n                                                 ----     2,658\r\n\r\n          2nd Brigade, Ferguson:\r\n              36th                                591\r\n              40th (1st batt.)                    923\r\n              71st      ”                         935\r\n                                                 ----     2,449\r\n\r\n          3rd Brigade, Nightingale:\r\n              29th                                616\r\n              82nd (1st batt.)                    904\r\n                                                 ----     1,520\r\n\r\n          4th Brigade, Bowes:\r\n              6th (1st batt.)                     943\r\n              32nd ”                              870\r\n                                                 ----     1,813\r\n\r\n          5th Brigade, C.

It had been moved from\r\n  Catlin Crawfurd’s to Fane’s brigade the day after Roliça, in\r\n  exchange for the 45th. Napier has inserted it, and counted it, in\r\n  both places with its 945 men.\r\n\r\n  (3) Forgotten that Spencer’s artillery, 245 men, had been left\r\n  behind for want of horses.\r\n\r\n  (4) Omitted (very excusably) to note that two and a half\r\n  companies of the 20th Regiment were not ashore yet, having\r\n  drifted away on a disabled transport, so that the regiment is\r\n  given 135 too strong.\r\n\r\n  There is therefore a total excess of no less than 1,799 British\r\n  troops. On the other hand, the Portuguese of Trant are probably\r\n  understated by some 350 bayonets.\r\n\r\nThe French cavalry had been hovering around Vimiero all through the\r\ntwentieth, and knowing that Junot was not far off, Sir Arthur had\r\ntaken all precautions against being surprised. General Fane, in charge\r\nof the outposts, had pushed pickets of riflemen into the wooded\r\nheights that faced the British position on the northern bank of the\r\nMaceira[221]: vedettes of the 20th Light Dragoons were thrown out three\r\nor four miles to the front, and especially watched the Torres Vedras\r\nroad. About midnight they began to hear the approach of the enemy;\r\nthe rumbling of his guns and caissons over the wooden bridge of Villa\r\nFacaia travelled for miles through the still night air. In half an\r\nhour Wellesley was warned that the French were drawing near, and sent\r\nthe order round all his brigades to be under arms and in line on their\r\ndesignated position an hour before daybreak[222].\r\n\r\n  [221] Leach’s _Sketches_, p. 50. He was himself on the line of\r\n  pickets, 200 strong, which held the wooded height from which\r\n  Junot afterwards viewed the battle.\r\n\r\n  [222] Napier says that the news was brought ‘by a German officer\r\n  of dragoons, who showed some consternation.’ This statement\r\n  much offended the news-bearer Landsheit, a sergeant of the 20th\r\n  Light Dragoons, not an officer. He has left his protest in his\r\n  interesting autobiography, p. 264.\r\n\r\nBut the enemy was late in appearing: Junot had halted on the near\r\nside of the bridge of Villa Facaia, four miles away, to rest his men\r\nafter their night march and to allow them to cook their breakfast.\r\nIt was not till nearly nine in the morning that dense clouds of dust\r\nrolling along the Torres Vedras road bore witness to the approach of\r\nthe French. They were indistinctly visible, among woods and rolling\r\nupland, as they advanced with a broad front on each side of the village\r\nof Villa Facaia--a regiment of cavalry in front, then Loison on the\r\nleft and Delaborde on the right side of the road, finally Kellermann’s\r\ngrenadiers, the reserve of artillery, and the bulk of Margaron’s\r\ncavalry. The English were surprised to note that the columns showed\r\nas masses of dust colour, not of the customary dark blue. On account\r\nof the hot weather they had been provided with white linen frocks,\r\nand were wearing their uniform coats folded and buckled over their\r\nknapsacks[223].\r\n\r\n  [223] Col. Leslie’s _Military Journal_, p. 52.\r\n\r\nWellesley had been expecting to see the great column swerve to its\r\nleft, and approach him along the valley of the Maceira, by Cunhados and\r\nSobreiro Curvo. But instead of so doing Junot continued his progress\r\nnorthward, till he had completely marched past the English right\r\nwing, and only fronted and deployed when he had got on a level with\r\nVimiero. After driving off the small pickets of English riflemen who\r\nstill lay out in the woods a mile in front of Fane’s brigade[224], the\r\nFrench began to form a line of battle whose southern end was opposite\r\nWellesley’s centre. But at the same time the cavalry advance-guard was\r\nnoted riding far away to the north, toward Carrasqueira and Praganza,\r\nand it was clear that infantry were following them. Obviously there was\r\ngoing to be an attempt to turn the English position at its northern\r\nend, on the comparatively gentle slopes along the Lourinhão road.\r\n\r\n  [224] Col. Leach’s _Sketches_, pp. 50, 51.\r\n\r\nJunot after reconnoitring the British position in a somewhat\r\nperfunctory fashion, had resolved to leave alone the formidable heights\r\noccupied by the right wing, and to try to storm the low hill in front\r\nof Vimiero with his main body, while he turned Wellesley’s left with a\r\nsecondary column. This detachment was composed of the 3rd provisional\r\nregiment of dragoons, and Brennier’s brigade, the same four battalions\r\nwhich had fought so handsomely at Roliça. But the moment that Wellesley\r\nhad seen that his right flank was safe, and that his left was about\r\nto be attacked, he rapidly changed his line of battle. Ferguson, from\r\nbehind Vimiero, started to march north. Behind him followed three of\r\nthe four brigades which had occupied the hills above the sea. Only\r\nHill was still left on the crest to the south-west of Vimiero; Bowes,\r\nNightingale, and Acland--six battalions in all, taking with them six\r\nguns--dropped down into the valley of the Maceira, crossed it behind\r\nVimiero, and marched along the Lourinhão road parallel with Brennier’s\r\nmovement on the opposite side of the valley. In rear of these troops,\r\nand nearer the sea, Catlin Crawfurd and the Portuguese also moved\r\nnorthward, and took up a position near Ribamar, where they covered the\r\nflank of the other corps and were in a good position for preventing\r\nany movement of the French on the extreme north-west. Junot caught\r\na glimpse of the extensive transference of troops to the left which\r\nhis adversary was making, and struck with a sudden fear lest Brennier\r\nmight be overwhelmed, sent off another brigade--Solignac’s of Loison’s\r\ndivision--to support him. He would have been much wiser had he kept\r\nthese three battalions in hand to support his main attack, and merely\r\ndirected Brennier to demonstrate against the British left without\r\npressing his attack home. His last movement had divided his army into\r\ntwo halves, separated from each other by a gap of nearly two miles: for\r\nthe main attack he had only kept eight and a quarter battalions, three\r\nregiments of cavalry and seventeen guns, while seven battalions, one\r\nregiment of cavalry, and six guns had gone off on the turning movement.\r\nHow long their flank march was to be he had not calculated, for, not\r\ndiscerning the steepness of the ravine at the foot of the British\r\nposition, he had not realized that Brennier and Solignac would have to\r\ntake a vast sweep to the north in order to cross it. As a matter of\r\nfact they got completely out of touch with him and, what was worse,\r\nwith each other. Their diversion did not begin till the main battle was\r\nnearly over[225].\r\n\r\n  [225] Thiébault (iv. 188, 189) expresses (and with reason) his\r\n  wonder that Junot mixed his divisions so hopelessly, and thinks\r\n  that it would have been more rational to send Delaborde and his\r\n  second brigade after Brennier, instead of breaking up Loison’s\r\n  division by taking the supporting brigade from it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the French general deployed the second brigades of his two\r\ndivisions, Charlot’s of Loison’s, and Thomières’ of Delaborde’s, only\r\nfour and a quarter battalions in all, as a first line for the attack\r\non Vimiero. Kellermann’s four battalions of grenadiers in a second\r\nline were for the moment held back, as was the cavalry and the reserve\r\nartillery. But seven guns went forward with the first line. The French\r\ncame on in their usual style, a thick line of tirailleurs, supported by\r\nbattalion columns close in their rear. Fane and Anstruther were very\r\ncomfortably placed for repelling the attack: the latter had drawn up\r\nthe 52nd and 97th in line on the slope of the hill, partly hidden by a\r\ndip in the ground and largely covered by vines and brushwood: the 9th\r\nand 43rd were in open column to the rear, ready to act as a reserve.\r\nFane had got most of the riflemen of the 60th and 95th out in front,\r\nat the foot of the hill, in a very thick skirmishing line: only a few\r\ncompanies of them were in reserve along with the 50th (the famous\r\n‘dirty half-hundredth’) at the head of the slope. In consequence of the\r\norder which Junot had adopted, Thomières’ two battalions were opposed\r\nto Fane, and Charlot’s brigade to Anstruther on the southern half of\r\nthe hill. In each quarter the course of the fight was much the same:\r\nthe French tirailleurs pushed up the slope among the brushwood and\r\nvineyards, slowly driving the riflemen before them. Then, as they drew\r\nnear the crest, the two English brigadiers suddenly let loose their\r\nformed battalions upon the assailants. There was one fierce volley\r\nfrom the six guns on the hill top, and then the 97th charged Charlot’s\r\nmen in front, while the 52nd swerved round and took them in flank.\r\nOne smashing discharge at ten paces blew to pieces the heads of the\r\ncolumns of the 32nd and 82nd, which crumpled up in hopeless disorder\r\nand rolled down to the foot of the hill, pursued by their assailants. A\r\nfew moments later Fane dashed the 50th and the reserve companies of his\r\nrifles against Thomières’ troops, and sent them flying down the slope\r\nin equal disorder. They could not be rallied till they had got out\r\nof musketry range, and the seven guns which they had brought forward\r\nwith them were all captured: Delaborde and Charlot were wounded: the\r\ncommander of the 82nd was killed[226].\r\n\r\n  [226] The best narrative of the fight on Vimiero Hill is that in\r\n  General Anstruther’s ‘Journal,’ printed in the memoir attached to\r\n  Wyld’s _Atlas_: Leach and Rifleman Harris give many interesting\r\n  details.\r\n\r\nJunot’s first attack had failed, but his spirit was not yet broken: he\r\ncalled up half his reserve of grenadiers, two battalions under Colonel\r\nSt. Clair, and sent them against the hill on the same point, while the\r\ndébris of the two wrecked brigades were rallied and pushed forward in\r\nsupport. Eight guns under Foy (the historian in after-years of the\r\nwar), were brought out from the artillery reserve and pushed to the\r\nfront. The second attack, however, failed even more disastrously than\r\nthe first: the grenadiers, attacking on a narrow front and a single\r\npoint, were blown to pieces by the converging fire of the 52nd, the\r\n97th, and Fane’s two rifle battalions, as well as by the battery on\r\nthe hill, which having no longer any British skirmishers in front of\r\nit had a free field. It was here, as Wellesley’s dispatches show, that\r\nshrapnell shell, a recent invention of the British colonel of that\r\nname, was first used, and with the most effective results. St. Clair’s\r\nbattalions climbed halfway up the hill, but could do no more, and\r\nfinally gave way, bearing back with them their half-rallied supports.\r\nThe fight was rolling down the slope into the pine-wood at its foot,\r\nwhen Junot made his last desperate stroke. His only infantry reserve\r\nwas now the 1st Regiment of Grenadiers, two battalions under Colonel\r\nMaransin. He resolved to throw them into the fight _pour en finir_,\r\nas he said to his chief of the staff, but they ‘made a finish of it’\r\nin a way very different from his intention. This time the assailants,\r\nled by General Kellermann in person, made not for the front of the\r\nhill, but for the gap between it and the heights to the north, trying\r\nto turn Fane’s flank and to penetrate into the village of Vimiero by\r\ncoasting round the foot of the higher ground. There were at first no\r\ntroops directly opposed to the column, but soon the grenadiers found\r\nthemselves under fire from both flanks. On the southern side Anstruther\r\ntook from his reserve the 43rd, which had not yet fired a shot, and\r\nthrew it into the cemetery of Vimiero, from whence it descended on the\r\nleft flank of the leading battalion of grenadiers. On the northern\r\nside a new force intervened: General Acland on the heights along the\r\nLourinhão road had been acting as the reserve of Wellesley’s left wing:\r\nhe was not needed there, and seeing Kellermann’s attack threatening\r\nto break in between himself and Anstruther, took action on his own\r\nresponsibility. Marching a little southward along the ridge, he sent\r\nhis two companies of the 95th Rifles, and the light companies of his\r\ntwo line-battalions to fall on the right flank of the grenadiers. At\r\nthe same time he turned upon them the fire of two field-guns which were\r\nin reserve near his brigade.\r\n\r\nThe double flank attack cost Kellermann many men, and brought his\r\ncolumn to a standstill, but he held his ground for some time, till\r\nthe 43rd closed in upon him at the eastern end of Vimiero village.\r\nBoth French and English were in great disorder, the houses and\r\nenclosure-walls having broken up their formation. There was a furious\r\nhand-to-hand fight, volleys were interchanged at the distance of five\r\nyards, and both sides used the bayonet freely. At last the grenadiers\r\ngave way and retired sullenly towards their original position: they had\r\nlost many men, but so had the 43rd, who from a weak battalion of 700\r\nmen had forty killed and seventy-nine wounded.\r\n\r\nAll along the line the French were now falling back, and Junot brought\r\nup a regiment of dragoons to cover the retreat of the disordered\r\nmasses. Wellesley now resolved to make use of his handful of cavalry:\r\nclose behind Vimiero there were drawn up the 240 sabres of the 20th\r\nLight Dragoons, with 260 Portuguese horsemen in two squadrons on their\r\nflanks[227]. ‘Now, Twentieth, now is the time!’ cried Wellesley,\r\nlifting his cocked hat, and Colonel Taylor wheeled his regiment from\r\nbehind the sheltering hill and dashed at the retreating Frenchmen.\r\nThe two Portuguese squadrons started level with him, but after going\r\na few hundred yards and receiving a shot or two, they broke, fell\r\ninto disorder, and finally galloped to the rear amid the hoots of\r\nAnstruther’s brigade. But the 20th rode at the French dragoons who\r\nstood in their path, burst through them, and then plunged among the\r\nflying infantry, sabring them to right and left and taking many\r\nprisoners. They could not be stayed till they had hewn their way\r\nthrough the fugitives, to the place where Junot himself sat watching\r\nthe rout of his men. The charge had been pushed beyond all reasonable\r\nbounds, for the men were mad with excitement and would not halt. But as\r\nthey rode up the French hill they were checked by a stone wall, and at\r\nthe same time charged by the two reserve regiments of Margaron’s horse.\r\nIt was a wonder that the headstrong troopers were not annihilated, but\r\nthe larger part returned in safety to the English lines, leaving behind\r\nthem their colonel[228] and twenty men slain, twenty-four wounded, and\r\neleven prisoners.\r\n\r\n  [227] All this comes from the narrative, which I have already\r\n  utilized in more than one place, of Sergeant Landsheit of the\r\n  20th.\r\n\r\n  [228] Taylor, like the heroic Blake, and like Graham the victor\r\n  of Barossa, was one of Oxford’s few fighting men. Every visitor\r\n  to Christ Church sees his memorial stone, stating how he had\r\n  reformed and disciplined the regiment, when it came home a\r\n  skeleton from the West Indies in 1805, and had practically to be\r\n  raised anew. Since then it had been in the unfortunate expedition\r\n  to Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\nWe must now turn to the northern part of the battle-field, where the\r\nmain stress of the fighting did not begin till the engagement round\r\nVimiero was nearly over. This was the result of the reckless way in\r\nwhich Junot had sent his flanking brigades to attack over unexplored\r\nground. When Brennier reached the point at which he would naturally\r\nhave wheeled inward to climb the slopes along the Lourinhão road,\r\nhe came upon the deep and rugged valley of Toledo, the steepness of\r\nwhose slopes he did not realize till he had almost reached its brink.\r\nHaving guns with him, the French brigadier thought the obstacle\r\nimpassable, and turned northward again in a long sweep by the village\r\nof Carrasqueira, the 3rd Dragoons still heading his march. In this wide\r\nflanking movement he passed quite out of sight of the British.\r\n\r\nBut Solignac, with the second brigade which Junot had told off for\r\nthe northern diversion, was not so cautious. He too came upon the\r\nravine; but instead of turning it he sought out its least precipitous\r\npoint and passed it near its head, underneath the farm of Ventosa.\r\nHaving crossed, he deployed his three battalions, brought up his right\r\nshoulder, and ascended the gentle slope. By this movement he was\r\ndevoting his brigade to destruction. On the hill above he could see\r\nonly the thin line of British skirmishers, but hidden behind the crest\r\nwas the main body of Wellesley’s right wing, the seven battalions of\r\nFerguson, Nightingale, and Bowes. They had long watched the approach\r\nof the French, and were lying down in battle order. In front were\r\nFerguson’s three regiments, the 36th, 40th, and 71st, and one of\r\nNightingale’s, the 82nd. A couple of hundred yards to the rear was the\r\nsecond line, the 29th of Nightingale’s brigade, and the 6th and 32nd,\r\nwhich formed Bowes’ command. Acland and Catlin Crawfurd were a mile\r\naway in different directions, but not too far to have been called in if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nWhen Solignac’s men reached the brow of the hill, the four British\r\nbattalions in the front line rose up and marched to meet them. Their\r\nlong array completely overlapped at both ends the advancing columns\r\nand their screen of light troops[229], At the distance of one hundred\r\nyards all the four regiments directed a converging volley on the\r\nFrench, which almost swept away the tirailleurs and shook terribly\r\nthe supporting masses. Then they reloaded and advanced in silence on\r\nthe enemy, who were shouting, firing irregularly, and endeavouring to\r\ndeploy, with their officers all in front. For troops in such disorder\r\nthe near approach of the majestic two-deep line of 3,300 bayonets\r\nwas too much. They wavered and fled northward along the summit of\r\nthe ridge, carrying with them their commander, Solignac, desperately\r\nwounded. The British pursued, halting at intervals to pour a volley\r\ninto the retreating masses, and picking up on the way many prisoners,\r\nand also the three guns which the enemy had laboriously dragged up the\r\nhill.\r\n\r\n  [229] There is a good account of this charge in the anonymous\r\n  ‘T.S.’ of the 71st, p. 50.\r\n\r\nThe pursuit was stopped by an unexpected development. General Brennier\r\nhad heard from afar the heavy musketry fire which told him that his\r\nsupporting brigade was engaged. He was now on the summit of the\r\nheights, having at last accomplished his long flank march. Pushing\r\nhastily forward, he came to the edge of a saddle-backed depression in\r\nthe ridge, and had the spectacle of the fight at his feet. The 36th\r\nand 40th were engaged in driving the wrecks of Solignac’s men back in\r\na north-westerly direction, while the 71st and 82nd, halted around\r\nthe captured guns, were resting and reforming their ranks. Without\r\na moment’s hesitation, Brennier threw his four battalions upon the\r\ntwo regiments that lay beneath him. He had taken them by surprise;\r\nattacked diagonally by fresh troops, and charged by the two squadrons\r\nof dragoons that accompanied the French, they reeled back in some\r\ndisorder and abandoned the guns that they had taken. But they rallied\r\nin a moment, and returned to the fight aided by the 29th[230], the\r\nreserve regiment of Nightingale’s brigade. There was heavy firing\r\nfor a moment, but very soon Brennier’s troops broke and fled up the\r\nslope which they had just descended. Their flight was covered by the\r\ndragoons, who suffered severely in holding off the pursuers, losing\r\nmany officers, among them the young Arrighi, a kinsman of the Bonaparte\r\nfamily. Brennier was left on the field wounded and a prisoner, and not\r\nonly did his men lose the guns which they had just recaptured, but they\r\nalso left behind the three which had accompanied their own column.\r\nTheir hurried retreat was accelerated by the fire of a half-battery,\r\nbrought up from the reserve, which played upon them with effect till\r\nthey had plunged down into the ravine and regained their original\r\nposition on the opposite heights.\r\n\r\n  [230] There are clear accounts of this fighting in Col. Leslie’s\r\n  autobiography, p. 61, as well as in the narrative of ‘T.S.’ of\r\n  the 71st.\r\n\r\nAll the fighting here had been done by Ferguson’s and Nightingale’s\r\nfive battalions. Bowes’ brigade did not fire a shot or lose a man, and\r\nCatlin Crawfurd and the Portuguese were only beginning to approach the\r\nscene of action when Brennier’s column broke up and fled. The main\r\nhonours of the fight must be given to the 71st and 82nd, who lost\r\nrespectively 112 and 61 men out of the total of 272 casualties suffered\r\nin this part of the action.\r\n\r\nTwo and a half hours after the battle began the French, both in\r\nthe north and the south of the field, were retiring in confusion.\r\nThe British were awaiting eagerly the order for a general\r\nadvance--especially Ferguson, who, with the 36th and 40th, had got\r\npart of Solignac’s brigade pinned into an angle of the hills, from\r\nwhich they could not easily escape when attacked. But instead of the\r\norder to advance there came a prohibition to move, and the French were\r\nallowed to withdraw unmolested. The stream of fugitives from Brennier’s\r\nand Solignac’s fight joined that from the centre; then both shook\r\nthemselves together and formed up in more or less order on the heights.\r\nThe reserve artillery under Hulot and Prost (Foy had been wounded) kept\r\nup a distant and ineffective fire towards the hill of Vimiero, more\r\nto put heart into their own infantry by the noise of their guns than\r\nin any hope of harming the English. Margaron’s cavalry showed a front\r\nbehind them, and the two belated battalions from Lisbon, which arrived\r\nabout noon, were sent to the front and displayed on the edge of the\r\nheights to make some show of force. But the French would not have stood\r\na serious attack: every single unit of their infantry had been deeply\r\nengaged and had suffered a thorough defeat. More than half their guns\r\n(thirteen out of twenty-three) had been captured. The cavalry was in\r\nbetter case, though two of its regiments had suffered severely, yet it\r\ncould not by itself have resisted the attack of the victorious British.\r\nA vigorous push would have sent the whole mass reeling backward, not on\r\nTorres Vedras or Lisbon--for these roads would have been barred to them\r\nwhen Wellesley advanced--but on the rugged path, over the spurs of the\r\nSierra da Baragueda, which leads to Santarem.\r\n\r\nBut while the French were striving to rally and to form a new front,\r\nthe leaden hand of Sir Harry Burrard was laid upon the British\r\narmy. That leisurely person had only landed on the morning of the\r\ntwenty-first, and the battle was in full progress before he rode up\r\nfrom the beach to Vimiero. He had the grace not to interfere with the\r\nmovements of troops which Wellesley had already ordered; but when\r\nthe victory was won, and his subordinate rode up to him crying, ‘Sir\r\nHarry, now is your time to advance, the enemy is completely beaten, and\r\nwe shall be in Lisbon in three days[231],’ he refused to listen. The\r\narmy, he said, had done enough for one day, and he intended to wait\r\nfor the arrival of Sir John Moore and the division from the Baltic\r\nbefore making any further move. Greatly disconcerted by this stolid\r\nopposition, Wellesley launched forth into argument: the French army,\r\nas he pointed out, was now so placed that it had lost control of its\r\nline of retreat on Torres Vedras and Lisbon. Hill’s intact brigade,\r\nand those of Fane and Anstruther had but to advance a mile or so, and\r\nthe French were irretrievably cut off from their base of operations.\r\nAt the same time the five brigades of the left wing, of which those\r\nof Bowes and Crawfurd were absolutely intact, might so hustle and\r\npress the retreating enemy that he could never rally. At this moment\r\narrived an aide-de-camp from Ferguson, who begged to be allowed to\r\ngo on: ‘a column of broken troops 1,500 to 2,000 strong had in their\r\nconfusion got into a hollow, and could be cut off from their main\r\nbody by a movement in advance of his brigade[232].’ The enemy had\r\nlost all their artillery, were retiring in the utmost confusion, none\r\nof them save the cavalry were regularly formed, and it was his hope\r\nthat he might be allowed to continue to go forward. Burrard still\r\nremained obdurate, though Wellesley pointed out to him that he had\r\nnine thousand fresh troops in hand, that every soldier had a day’s\r\nfood cooked in his haversack, that the ammunition reserve was ready\r\nto move, and that, with twelve days’ provisions in the camp and an\r\nample store of munitions, he had it in his power to march forward both\r\nrapidly and with complete security[233]. But all these arguments were\r\nof no effect. The slow and cautious Burrard chose to believe that Junot\r\nmight still have a large and intact reserve, that his cavalry was too\r\ndangerous to be meddled with, and that the dispersion of the British\r\nbrigades (there were more than three miles between Hill’s extreme\r\nright and Ferguson’s extreme left) would make a general advance a very\r\ndislocated and hazardous business[234]. He utterly refused to listen\r\nto any further discussion, and, as the French were now in full retreat\r\nand disappearing over the eastern horizon, ordered the troops back to\r\ncamp. They returned with colours flying and bands playing, dragging the\r\ncaptured French guns, and with a considerable column of prisoners in\r\ntheir midst. But every one, from Generals Spencer and Ferguson down to\r\nthe youngest private, was utterly puzzled at the tame and inconsequent\r\nend to such a glorious day.\r\n\r\n  [231] Evidence of Col.

Torrens (p. 127).\r\n\r\n  [234] Burrard’s account of his own views before the Court of\r\n  Inquiry (_Proceedings_, pp. 115, 116, 135).\r\n\r\nThe losses had been very moderate--four officers and 131 men killed,\r\nthirty-seven officers and 497 men wounded, two officers and forty-nine\r\nmen missing. Of the total of 720 no less than 573 were from the ten\r\nbattalions of Fane’s, Anstruther’s, and Ferguson’s brigades. Those of\r\nHill, Bowes, and Catlin Crawfurd did not return a single casualty. The\r\nhandful of prisoners were mainly supplied by the 20th Light Dragoons,\r\nand by the two rifle battalions, whose pickets had been driven in\r\nat the commencement of the fight[235]. The French losses were very\r\ndifferent: both Foy and Thiébault acknowledge a total of 1,800, and\r\nthis may be taken as a minimum: of these some 300 or 400 were unwounded\r\nprisoners. Delaborde and three brigadier-generals--Charlot, Brennier,\r\nand Solignac--as well as Colonels Foy and Prost of the artillery, were\r\nwounded. Two battalion commanders were killed, a third and the disabled\r\nBrennier were prisoners. Men and officers were alike disheartened:\r\nevery single corps present had been engaged: even the squadron of\r\nvolunteer cavalry had been in action against Taylor’s dragoons: more\r\nthan half the guns had been lost, and the officers who brought back\r\nthose that remained asked themselves in wonder how they had ever been\r\npermitted to get away[236]. But at least they were unmolested in their\r\nretreat: using the two battalions that had just come up from Lisbon\r\nas his rearguard, Junot retired unharmed, but full of despair, on\r\nTorres Vedras. It was not till early on the next morning that the last\r\nstragglers of his scattered army drifted in to join the main body.\r\n\r\n  [235] See table of losses at Vimiero in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n  [236] _Souvenirs Militaires_ of Hulot, who commanded one of the\r\n  two reserve batteries, p. 235: ‘J’étais étonné de ne pas voir\r\n  l’ennemi fondre sur mes pièces,’ &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV: CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE CONVENTION OF CINTRA\r\n\r\n\r\nFor only one single day did the incubus of Burrard rest upon the\r\nBritish army in Portugal, though that day was one on which he succeeded\r\nin changing a decisive victory, which might have laid a whole kingdom\r\nat his feet, into an ordinary successful defensive action. He had\r\nstopped Wellesley’s triumphant march at noon on August 21; early on\r\nthe morning of the twenty-second Sir Hew Dalrymple appeared in Maceira\r\nBay, disembarked, and took over the command. He naturally began his\r\ntenure of control by interviewing his two predecessors, whose divergent\r\nviews as to the situation and its requirements were laid before him.\r\nHe was an old man, and unpractised in the field: he had only seen\r\nwar in the wretched Flanders campaign of 1793-4. His prejudice was\r\nin favour of caution, and he was not slow to let it be seen that he\r\nregarded Wellesley’s actions in the past, and still more his plans\r\nfor the future, as rash and hazardous. ‘On the first interview that I\r\nhad with Sir Hew Dalrymple,’ said Wellesley at the Court of Inquiry\r\nin the following winter, ‘I had reason to believe that I did not\r\npossess his confidence: nay more, that he was prejudiced against any\r\nopinions which I should give him[237].’ The veteran’s ill-concealed\r\nhostility was, we cannot doubt, mainly due to an unhappy inspiration\r\nof Castlereagh, who had sent him a letter bidding him ‘take Sir Arthur\r\nWellesley into his particular confidence, as he had been, for a length\r\nof time past, in the closest habits of communication with His Majesty’s\r\nministers with respect to the affairs of Spain.’ He was also directed\r\n‘to make the most prominent use of him which the rules of the service\r\nwould permit[238].’ Such a letter very naturally caused Dalrymple to\r\nlook upon the young lieutenant-general as a sort of emissary from the\r\nGovernment, sent to overrule his plans and curb his full power of\r\ncommand. He was inclined, consciously or unconsciously, to entertain a\r\nstrong prejudice against anything that Wellesley might recommend: and\r\nwe cannot doubt that the latter, always stiff and haughty, was at this\r\nmoment in a state of suppressed fury at the foiling of his plans by\r\nBurrard on the preceding day. Probably, in his own cold way, he let his\r\nindignation appear, and Dalrymple may have been glad of an excuse for\r\nrepressing him.\r\n\r\n  [237] Wellesley’s evidence at the Court of Inquiry\r\n  (_Proceedings_, p. 81).\r\n\r\n  [238] Castlereagh to Dalrymple, July 15 (_Well. Disp._, iv. 18).\r\n\r\nThe plan which Wellesley had drawn up for the conduct of the campaign,\r\nand which he now urged upon his chief, is detailed in the proceedings\r\nof the Court of Inquiry. He had hoped to get Sir John Moore’s division,\r\nwhose arrival was just reported, sent to Santarem, to cut off any\r\nattempt of Junot to escape out of the Lisbon peninsula by following\r\nthe road along the right bank of the Tagus: the Portuguese were to be\r\nbrought up to assist. Meanwhile the army which had fought at Vimiero\r\nwas to turn the position of Torres Vedras, on which the enemy had\r\nretired, by marching along the sea-coast by the route that leads to\r\nMafra. If Junot let them march past him, he would infallibly lose\r\nLisbon; for they could, by forcing the pace, arrive in the capital as\r\nsoon as he. If he abandoned Torres Vedras, and fell back on Mafra or\r\nMontechique as soon as he saw them moving, he would have to fight a\r\nsecond battle on the twenty-third or twenty-fourth, with an army which\r\nhad been gravely demoralized by the events of Roliça and Vimiero, and\r\nwhich could not receive much succour from Lisbon: for the populace of\r\nthat city, when apprised of the defeat of the French, would undoubtedly\r\nhave burst into insurrection, and would have required for its\r\nrepression every man of the 5,000[239] troops who had been left to hold\r\nit down. There was a third possibility, that Junot, on hearing that the\r\nEnglish were marching past his flank, might have hastened from Torres\r\nVedras to attack their line of march by one of the cross-roads (such\r\nas that from Torres Vedras to Puente de Roll), which cut down to the\r\nAtlantic coast. But Wellesley had convinced himself that this chance\r\nwould not occur: he reckoned, very rightly, on the exhaustion of the\r\nenemy on the day after such a crushing blow as Vimiero. As a matter of\r\nfact, on the morning of the twenty-second, at the moment when the head\r\nof the British column, if it had marched, would have been outflanking\r\ntheir position, Junot and those of his generals who were not _hors de\r\ncombat_ were sitting in council of war at Torres Vedras, with despair\r\nin their souls, and resolving to ask for terms on which to evacuate\r\nPortugal. Kellermann was just about to ride in to the English lines\r\nto open negotiations[240]. The idea of an ‘offensive return’ by the\r\nFrench was in the head of the cautious Burrard[241]: but not in that of\r\nWellesley, who had made up his mind ‘that they would act in Portugal\r\nas they did in Egypt: they tried their strength once in the field, and\r\nhaving failed they would have continued to retreat till they could have\r\ngot into safety. I do not believe that any corps could have fallen on\r\nthe flank of our march on the twenty-third.’ The only course open to\r\nthe French, in his opinion, was to throw over any idea of holding the\r\ncapital, withdraw its garrison, and cross the Tagus at Saccavem or\r\nVillafranca, or Santarem, by means of the ships which lay in the river,\r\nand the large fleet of barges which is always to be found in and near\r\nLisbon. Having passed the Tagus they might cut their way through the\r\ninsurgents of the Alemtejo, disperse the Spanish levies about Elvas and\r\nBadajoz, and press north through Estremadura to join Bessières[242].\r\nThis very idea did for a moment flash through the brains of some\r\nof Junot’s council of war at Torres Vedras: but there lay on their\r\nminds, like a nightmare, the remembrance of their awful march through\r\nthe Estremaduran mountains in the preceding autumn. If, journeying\r\nunopposed from Ciudad Rodrigo to Lisbon, they had been nearly starved\r\nin that wilderness, what would be their fate if they had to cut their\r\nway through an insurrection, with the English army hanging on their\r\nheels? The most hopeful could only say that perhaps half the army might\r\nstruggle through to Old Castile.\r\n\r\n  [239] This figure, of course, does not include the garrisons of\r\n  the outlying places, but only those immediately in and about\r\n  the capital, after the 66th and _compagnies d’élite_ marched to\r\n  Torres Vedras.\r\n\r\n  [240] Hulot, _Mémoires Militaires_, p. 236.\r\n\r\n  [241] Questions asked of Wellesley by Burrard at the Court of\r\n  Inquiry (_Proceedings_, p. 133).\r\n\r\n  [242] Wellesley to Mr. Stuart, Aug. 25, 1808 (_Well. Disp._, iv.\r\n  105); Wellesley’s address at the Court of Inquiry (_Proceedings_,\r\n  p. 132).\r\n\r\nWellesley’s arguments to Dalrymple had no further effect than to induce\r\nthat general to make up his mind that the troops should march not on\r\nthe twenty-second but on the twenty-third, and not on Mafra but on\r\nTorres Vedras. Sir John Moore’s division was to be brought down at\r\nonce to Maceira Bay, to join the main army, and not to be sent (as\r\nWellesley had urged) to Santarem. With the aid of this reinforcement\r\nDalrymple hoped to be strong enough to force back Junot into Lisbon.\r\nThe resolve meant fatal delay: Moore did not begin to disembark till\r\nAugust 25, and his last men did not get ashore till August 30. On\r\nthat day only could Junot have been attacked seriously, and meanwhile\r\nhe would have obtained nine days in which to fortify his positions\r\nand to place Lisbon in a thorough state of defence. The consequences\r\nentailed would have been a long siege, the probable devastation of the\r\nPortuguese capital, and the protraction of operations into November and\r\nDecember. Even then there would still have been Elvas and Almeida to be\r\nrecaptured[243].\r\n\r\n  [243] This is Wellesley’s own view (_Well. Disp._, iv. 121, 184,\r\n  185).\r\n\r\nBut things were not destined to take this course. Dalrymple was busy\r\ndrafting his orders for the movement of the next day on Torres Vedras,\r\nwhen an alarm ran through the camp that the French were at hand, and\r\nthe whole force flew to arms. This rumour was caused by the folly of\r\na Portuguese cavalry officer, whose vedettes had seen French horsemen\r\nin the distance; he imagined an army on the move and reported its\r\napproach. What he had really seen was General Kellermann, with two\r\nsquadrons of dragoons as his escort, bearing the white flag, and about\r\nto propose to the British commander-in-chief the evacuation of Portugal\r\nby the French army under a convention.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the fact that on the early morning of the\r\ntwenty-second, Junot had called together at Torres Vedras a council\r\nof war composed of all his surviving generals--Loison, Kellermann,\r\nDelaborde (who attended though suffering from two severe wounds),\r\nThiébault, the chief of the staff, Taviel, the commander of the\r\nartillery, Col. Vincent, the chief engineer, and Trousset, the chief\r\ncommissary at Lisbon. Junot’s spirits were very low: he began by\r\nexplaining that he had only fought at Vimiero to save the honour of\r\nthe French arms, not because he hoped for victory--a statement which\r\nwill not bear investigation in the light of his previous dispatches and\r\nletters[244]. The British, he said, were expecting huge reinforcements\r\nfrom the sea: Freire was now moving on Obidos, another Portuguese corps\r\non Santarem: the reports of the state of public opinion in Lisbon were\r\nmost alarming. Under these circumstances, ought the army to try the\r\nfortune of battle a second time? And if it must, what plan should be\r\nadopted? If it could not, what alternative remained? When such was\r\nthe spirit of the leader, it was easy to foresee the replies of his\r\nsubordinates. The army, they soon resolved, had done its best in the\r\nmost honourable fashion, but it was not ready for another fight. Indeed\r\nthe stragglers had not yet finished pouring into Torres Vedras, and the\r\nwearied rearguard which covered them had only reached the defile in\r\nfront of the town two hours after midnight[245]. The army, unmolested\r\nas it was, did not get into fighting trim again till two days after\r\nVimiero. On the twenty-second it was still in a state of complete\r\ndisorganization: if Dalrymple had marched on Mafra he would not have\r\nfound a man in his path.\r\n\r\n  [244] Cf. for Junot’s address, Foy, iv. 341, and Thiébault.\r\n\r\n  [245] Hulot, _Souvenirs Militaires_, pp. 235, 236.\r\n\r\nHaving resolved that the army was not ready for another battle, the\r\ncouncil of war had three alternatives before it: to fall back to cover\r\nLisbon on the positions of Mafra and Montechique; to evacuate Lisbon,\r\ncross the Tagus, and make for Elvas; or to try to negotiate with the\r\nBritish. The decision was soon made in favour of the third: Lisbon,\r\nwithout regular fortifications, and swarming with a discontented\r\npopulace, would be a mere snare for the army. The retreat via Elvas on\r\nOld Castile would mean the slow but certain destruction of the whole\r\ncorps[246]. For it was now known that Joseph Bonaparte had evacuated\r\nMadrid, and that Burgos was probably the nearest point where a French\r\nforce was to be found. Not one of the officers present had the heart\r\nto make a serious proposal for such a retreat. It only remained to try\r\nwhether Dalrymple was open to receive an offer: if he could be tempted\r\nby the prospect of receiving Lisbon with all its magazines and riches\r\nintact, he might allow the French army to return under safe conduct\r\nto their own land. Kellermann, who could understand English, more or\r\nless, and was considered a skilful diplomatist, was charged with the\r\nnegotiations. He rode out of Torres Vedras between ten and eleven in\r\nthe morning with his escort, charged with ample powers to treat. As he\r\npassed the rearguard in the pass, four miles outside the town, he told\r\nthe officer in command that he was going to visit the English ‘to see\r\nif he could get the army out of the mousetrap[247].’\r\n\r\n  [246] But it is said that Delaborde urged the possibility of this\r\n  move.\r\n\r\n  [247] Hulot heard this himself. Kellermann said ‘qu’il allait\r\n  trouver les Anglais, pour voir à nous tirer de la souricière’ (p.\r\n  236).\r\n\r\nBy two o’clock Kellermann was conferring with the English commander--he\r\nwas astonished to find that it was Dalrymple and not Wellesley. The\r\nreception that he met was an agreeable surprise to him. Dalrymple\r\nshowed his pleasure at the broaching of the idea of a convention in\r\nthe most undisguised fashion. The fact was that he was very glad\r\nto avoid the possible dangers of an immediate advance and a second\r\nfight. He called in Burrard and Wellesley to the interview, and from\r\nhis unguarded ‘asides’ to them, Kellermann soon learnt that Moore\r\nhad not yet landed, and that till he was ashore Dalrymple did not\r\nfeel safe. This gave the Frenchman a confidence which he had not\r\nat first possessed, and he at once assumed an air of self-reliance\r\nwhich he had been far from showing when he rode out of Torres Vedras.\r\nInstead of merely trying to save the army at all costs, he began to\r\nhaggle about details, and to speak about the possibility of resuming\r\nhostilities--the last thing in the world that he really desired[248].\r\n\r\n  [248] Foy, iv. 344, 345; _Well. Disp._, iv. 108.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt that a convention by which Portugal and all its\r\nfortresses could be recovered without the necessity of firing another\r\nshot was an eminently desirable thing. Wellesley did not hesitate a\r\nmoment in advising his superiors to take the offer. Burrard had given\r\naway the certainty of recapturing Lisbon yesterday: Dalrymple, by\r\ndelaying his advance, had on this very morning sacrificed the second\r\nchance (a much less brilliant one, it must be confessed) of ending\r\nthe campaign by a single blow. If Junot’s proposals were rejected and\r\nhostilities were resumed, there lay before the British army either\r\na siege of Lisbon, which could not fail to ruin the city, or a long\r\nstern-chase after the French, if they should resolve to cross the Tagus\r\nand march off through the Alemtejo. No doubt it would sound better\r\nin the ears of the British public if the surrender or destruction\r\nof Junot’s army could be reported. But as a matter of practical\r\nexpediency, the recovery of Lisbon and all its wealth unharmed was\r\nworth far more than the capture of a French army at the cost of much\r\ntime, many lives, and the ruin of the Portuguese capital. The loss of\r\n25,000 soldiers would be nothing to Napoleon, who disposed of more than\r\nhalf a million men: the blow to his pride would be almost as great if\r\nhe lost Portugal by a convention as if he lost it by a capitulation. As\r\na matter of fact he was much incensed at Junot, and would have dealt\r\nhardly with him if Dupont had not drawn off his wrath by failing in an\r\neven more disastrous fashion[249].\r\n\r\n  [249] See the curious account of the Emperor’s interviews with\r\n  Legendre and Thiébault, the chiefs of the staff to Dupont and\r\n  Junot, who appeared before him simultaneously at Valladolid\r\n  in January, 1809. The imperial thunders played so fiercely on\r\n  the army of Andalusia that the army of Portugal got off easily\r\n  (Thiébault, iv. 247-9). But Napoleon said that the English\r\n  had saved him the pain of crushing an old friend by sending\r\n  Dalrymple, Burrard, and Wellesley before a court-martial.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing what Kellermann had to say, the three English generals\r\nwithdrew into an inner room, and after a very short discussion agreed\r\nto treat. They told their visitor that he might have a forty-eight\r\nhours’ suspension of hostilities at once, and that they would open\r\nnegotiations on the general base that Junot and his army should be\r\nallowed to evacuate Portugal by sea without any of the forms of\r\ncapitulation, and be returned to their own country on British ships.\r\nThe details would take much discussion: meanwhile they invited\r\nKellermann to dine with them and to settle the main lines of the\r\nConvention before he returned to his commander. There was a long\r\npost-prandial debate, which showed that on two points there was likely\r\nto be trouble; one was the way in which Siniavin’s Russian fleet in the\r\nTagus was to be treated: the other was how much the French should be\r\nallowed to carry away with them from Portugal. Kellermann said that he\r\nasked for no more than their ‘military baggage and equipments,’ but he\r\nseemed to have a large idea of what came under these headings[250].\r\n\r\n  [250] Wellesley at the Court of Inquiry (_Well. Disp._, iv. 189).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the terms of the suspension of hostilities were successfully\r\ndrafted; the line of the Zizandre river was to be fixed as that of\r\ndemarcation between the two hosts. Neither of them was to occupy\r\nTorres Vedras: Dalrymple undertook to get the armistice recognized by\r\nFreire and the other Portuguese generals in the field. They were not\r\nto advance beyond Leiria and Thomar. The garrisons at Elvas, Almeida,\r\nPeniche, and elsewhere were to be included in the Convention, unless\r\nit should turn out that any of them had surrendered before August\r\n25--which as a matter of fact they had not. The Russian fleet in the\r\nTagus was to be treated as if in a neutral port. This last clause was\r\nmuch objected to by Wellesley, who found also several minor points in\r\nthe agreement of which he could not approve. But by the directions\r\nof Dalrymple he signed the suspension of arms after a protest; his\r\nsuperior had told him that it was ‘useless to drive the French to the\r\nwall upon points of form[251].’\r\n\r\n  [251] Wellesley’s evidence before the Court of Inquiry\r\n  (_Proceedings_, p. 83).\r\n\r\nThe subsequent negotiations for a definite convention occupied seven\r\ndays, from August 23 to 30. On the first-named day Junot evacuated\r\nTorres Vedras, according to the stipulations of the agreement made by\r\nKellermann. He retired to the line of hills behind him, establishing\r\nLoison’s division at Mafra and Delaborde’s at Montechique. Dalrymple,\r\non the other hand, moved his head quarters forward to Ramalhal, a\r\nposition just north of Torres Vedras, and only nine miles from Vimiero.\r\nIn this respect he profited less than the French from the suspension\r\nof hostilities: it is true that he got leisure to disembark Moore’s\r\ntroops, but Junot gained the much more important advantage of a safe\r\nretreat to a good position, and of leisure to strengthen himself in\r\nit. It must not be supposed, however, that he was in a comfortable\r\nsituation; Lisbon was seething with suppressed rebellion. The news of\r\nFrench victories, which had been published to quiet the people, had\r\nsoon been discovered to be nothing more than an impudent fiction. At\r\nany moment an insurrection might have broken out: the garrison and the\r\nmob were alike in a state of extreme nervous tension, which took shape\r\non the one side in assassinations, and on the other in wanton firing\r\nat every person who approached a sentinel, or refused to stand when\r\nchallenged by a patrol.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations for a definitive convention suffered several checks.\r\nAt one moment it seemed likely that the Portuguese army might give\r\ntrouble. General Freire arrived at Ramalhal in a state of high wrath,\r\nto protest that he ought to have been made a party to the suspension\r\nof hostilities. There was, as Napier remarks, more plausibility than\r\nreal foundation in his objection[252], for his motley army had taken no\r\npart whatever in the operations that had brought Junot to his knees.\r\nBut he could make a distinct point when he asked by what authority\r\nDalrymple had given promises as to his neutrality in the agreement with\r\nKellermann, or laid down lines which he was not to pass. Freire was\r\nall the bolder because his levies were now being strengthened by the\r\nforces from Oporto which the Bishop had lately raised, while a small\r\nSpanish brigade under the Marquis of Valladares, lent by the Galician\r\nJunta, had come down as far as Guarda. But he contented himself with\r\nprotests, without committing any definite act that might have rendered\r\nthe Convention impossible.\r\n\r\n  [252] Napier, i. 225.\r\n\r\nA more dangerous source of possible rupture was the view of the\r\nsituation taken by Sir Charles Cotton, the admiral in command of the\r\nBritish blockading squadron off the mouth of the Tagus. As Wellesley\r\nhad foreseen, the naval men were determined to secure the possession of\r\nthe Russian ships of Siniavin. Cotton refused to entertain the proposal\r\nthat such a force should be allowed a free departure from Lisbon, as\r\nif from a neutral port, and should be given a long start before being\r\npursued. He had held the Russians under blockade for many a weary\r\nmonth, and was not going to abandon his hold upon them. Why should the\r\nFrench evacuation of Portugal place Siniavin in a better position than\r\nhe had ever occupied before? The admiral declared that he saw no reason\r\nwhy the Russians should be included in the Convention at all. If there\r\nwas going to be any agreement made with them, he should conduct it\r\nhimself, treating directly with Siniavin instead of through a French\r\nintermediary.\r\n\r\nSir Hew Dalrymple was forced to report to the French commander these\r\nobjections of the admiral. It seemed possible for a moment that the\r\ndifficulty would not be got over, and that war must recommence.\r\nWellesley strongly advised his chief to try the game of bluff--to\r\nannounce to Junot that operations would be resumed at the end of the\r\nstipulated forty-eight hours, as Sir Charles Cotton had objected to\r\nthe terms of the armistice, but that he was prepared to take into\r\nconsideration any new proposals which might be made to him before the\r\ninterval of two days expired[253]. Such a firm policy, he thought,\r\nwould induce the French to yield the point--all the more because Junot\r\nand Siniavin were known to be on very bad terms. But Dalrymple would\r\nnot accept this plan. He merely reported the admiral’s proposals to\r\nJunot, without any intimation that the resumption of hostilities must\r\nresult from their rejection. This move placed the power of playing the\r\ngame of brag in the Frenchman’s hands. Seeing that Dalrymple did not\r\nseem to desire to break off negotiations, he assumed an indignant tone,\r\nand began to talk of his determination not to concede an inch, and of\r\nthe harm that he could do if he were forced to fight. ‘The English\r\nmight take away the half-drafted convention: he would have none of it.\r\nHe would defend Lisbon street by street: he would burn as much of it as\r\nhe could not hold, and it should cost them dear to take from him what\r\nremained[254].’ At the same time he made a final proposal to Siniavin,\r\nthat he should put ashore his 6,000 seamen and marines, to take part\r\nin the defence of Lisbon on the land side. This was only part of the\r\ngame of bluff, and intended for the benefit of the English rather than\r\nof Siniavin, for Junot knew perfectly well, from the latter’s previous\r\nconduct, that he was bent on playing his own hand, and would not fire a\r\nsingle shot to help the French.\r\n\r\n  [253] Evidence of Wellesley before the Court of Inquiry\r\n  (_Proceedings_, pp. 87-91).\r\n\r\n  [254] Foy, iv. 352, and Thiébault.\r\n\r\nAll Junot’s desperate language was, in fact, no more than a device\r\nto squeeze better terms out of Dalrymple. The actual point on which\r\nthe argument grew hot was a mere pretext, for the Russian admiral\r\nutterly refused to assist the French, and intimated that he should\r\nprefer to conclude a separate convention of his own with Sir Charles\r\nCotton. Clearly it was not worth while for the Duke of Abrantes to risk\r\nanything on behalf of such a torpid ally.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the Convention was reduced to a definitive form between\r\nAugust 27 and 30. Colonel George Murray, the quartermaster-general,\r\nacted as the British negotiator, while Kellermann continued to\r\nrepresent Junot. The details were settled in Lisbon, where Murray\r\ntook up his residence, sending back frequent reports to his superior\r\nofficer at Ramalhal. Dalrymple and Cotton carried their point in that\r\nno allusion whatever was made to the Russians in the document. Junot\r\nfound a salve for his injured pride by remembering that he had slipped\r\na mention of Napoleon as ‘Emperor of the French,’ into the text of the\r\nsuspension of hostilities[255]: in this he thought that he had won\r\na great success, for the British Government had hitherto refused to\r\nrecognize any such title, and had constantly irritated its adversaries\r\nby alluding to the master of the Continent as ‘General Bonaparte,’ or\r\nthe ‘actual head of the French executive.’\r\n\r\n  [255] Article 1 of the armistice mentioned ‘his Imperial and\r\n  Royal Majesty, Napoleon I,’ though this formula did not recur in\r\n  the Convention, which only spoke of the ‘French Army.’\r\n\r\nThe terms of the Convention need close study[256]: it comprised\r\ntwenty-two articles and three supplementary paragraphs of addenda. The\r\nfirst article provided that the French should surrender Lisbon and the\r\nPortuguese fortresses in their existing condition, without harming or\r\ndismantling them. The second and third granted the army of Junot a safe\r\ndeparture by sea in English vessels: they were not to be considered\r\nprisoners of war, might take their arms and baggage, and were to be\r\nlanded at any port between Rochefort and L’Orient. The fourth, fifth,\r\nand sixth articles attempted to define the property which the French\r\nmight take away--their horses, their guns of French calibre (but not\r\nany that they might have found in the Portuguese arsenals), with\r\nsixty rounds for each piece, their wagons, their military chest, in\r\nshort, ‘all their equipment, and all that is comprehended under the\r\nname of property of the army.’ It was found, later on, that these\r\nparagraphs had been too loosely worded, and gave much endless occasion\r\nfor disputes. The next six articles settled the manner in which the\r\ndeparting army was to embark, and the order in which each of the\r\nstrongholds that it evacuated was to be given up to the British.\r\nThe thirteenth and fourteenth articles arranged for the appointment\r\nof commissaries by each side, to deal with disputed points in the\r\nConvention, and added the curious clause that ‘where a doubt arose as\r\nto the meaning of any article, it should be explained favourably to the\r\nFrench army.’\r\n\r\n  [256] The full text will be found in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nBut the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth articles were the most\r\nobjectionable part of the Convention. It was true that they secured\r\nthat no more taxes or contributions were to be raised by Junot, and\r\nthat undischarged fines which he had laid on the Portuguese should be\r\nregarded as cancelled. But they also provided that French civilians in\r\nPortugal might either depart with the army, or, if they preferred it,\r\nmight be allowed to remain behind unmolested, and have a year in which\r\nto dispose of their property. This might perhaps pass: not so, however,\r\nthe ensuing clause, which provided that Portuguese subjects should not\r\nbe rendered accountable for their political conduct during the French\r\noccupation: all who had taken service with the usurping government were\r\nto be placed under the protection of the British, and to suffer no\r\ninjury in person or property. They were also to be granted liberty to\r\ndepart with the French army if they chose.\r\n\r\nThe five remaining articles were unimportant. The eighteenth secured\r\nthe release of Caraffa and the rest of Junot’s Spanish prisoners,\r\nand provided that in return the few French officers of the army of\r\nPortugal, whom the Spaniards had captured at Oporto and Elvas, should\r\nbe liberated. The twenty-first permitted Junot to send one of his\r\naides-de-camp directly to France to carry the news of the Convention,\r\nso that preparations might be made for the reception of the troops[257].\r\n\r\n  [257] For the strange way in which Junot utilized this permission\r\n  for his personal profit, see page 281.\r\n\r\nThree unimportant supplementary articles were added below the\r\nsignatures of Murray and Kellermann: one stipulated that French\r\ncivilian prisoners in the hands of the English and Portuguese should be\r\nreleased, another that Junot’s army should subsist on its own magazines\r\ntill it embarked, a third that the British should permit the entry of\r\nprovisions into Lisbon, now that the Convention had been concluded.\r\n\r\nSuch was the celebrated agreement which was destined to gain a most\r\nunhappy notoriety in England under the name of the ‘Convention of\r\nCintra,’ a designation which it is hard to understand, for it was first\r\nsketched at Torres Vedras, and was discussed and ratified at Lisbon.\r\nThe only connexion which it had with Cintra was that Dalrymple’s\r\ndispatch to the British Government, enclosing the document in its\r\nlatest form, was dated from that pleasant spot in the environs of\r\nLisbon. But it would perhaps be pedantic to give any other name to such\r\na well-known document, than that under which it has been known for the\r\nlast ninety-three years.\r\n\r\nAfter a careful investigation of the details of this famous agreement,\r\nthe conclusion at which the impartial student will probably arrive is\r\nthat while on the military side it was justifiable, it presented grave\r\npolitical faults. In order to recover Lisbon with its arsenals, its\r\nforts and its shipping, all intact, Dalrymple might without serious\r\nblame have granted even more to the French. By the Convention he saved,\r\nnot only the wealth of the capital, and the lives of the troops who\r\nmust have fallen in storming it, but, most important of all, time. If\r\nhe had but known the value of that commodity, he might have been in\r\nMadrid at the head of all his British troops by October 1, or even\r\nearlier. ‘I do not know what Sir Hew proposes to do,’ wrote Wellesley\r\nthe morning after the Convention was signed, ‘but if I were in his\r\nsituation I would have 20,000 men in Madrid in less than a month\r\nfrom this day[258]’ But the importance of time was never realized by\r\nthe old commander-in-chief: he was superseded long before his army\r\nhad even moved up to the Portuguese frontier. Looking, therefore,\r\nat the Convention in the broadest aspect, we hold that its military\r\nadvantages entirely outweighed those which might have been secured by\r\na prolongation of hostilities. But this conclusion does not mean that\r\nthere were not points in the military part of the agreement that might\r\nhave been modified with advantage.\r\n\r\n  [258] Wellesley to Mr. Stuart, Sept. 1, 1808 (_Well. Disp._, iv.\r\n  121).\r\n\r\nIt is when we turn to the political section of the Convention that we\r\nlight upon grave faults and mistakes on the part of Dalrymple. The\r\nfirst and foremost was that he signed the document without previously\r\nsubmitting certain portions of it to the Portuguese government. In\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth articles the British general took upon\r\nhimself to grant certain favours both to French civilians resident in\r\nPortugal, and to Portuguese subjects who had taken service under Junot,\r\nwhich he had no authority to concede. These were points which concerned\r\nnot the British army but the Portuguese civil administration, and\r\nshould not have been decided without a consultation with our allies,\r\nand a permission from them to make terms on their behalf. The sixteenth\r\narticle allowed Frenchmen resident in Lisbon to remain there for a\r\nyear after the Convention, if they did not chose to leave the country\r\nwith Junot and his troops. To permit subjects of the hostile power to\r\nremain in Lisbon for so long was, of course, most distasteful to the\r\nPortuguese government, which was naturally desirous of expelling at\r\nonce, according to the ordinary customs of war, a body of persons many\r\nof whom had made themselves the partners and instruments of Junot’s\r\npeculations, and who for the next twelve months would serve as spies\r\nand purveyors of intelligence to the French Emperor. Nothing more than\r\nthe leave to quit Lisbon in Junot’s wake should have been secured to\r\nthem, unless the Junta of Regency gave its consent. The seventeenth\r\narticle is even more objectionable: a considerable portion of the\r\nbureaucracy of Portugal had been weak and criminal enough to acquiesce\r\nin the French usurpation, and to make themselves the tools of the Duke\r\nof Abrantes. It was natural that their countrymen should feel deeply\r\nindignant with them; and their lot was likely to be so hard that it was\r\nbut rational and humane to give them leave to quit the kingdom. But\r\nconsidering that they had deserved very ill of the state, it was surely\r\nwrong for the British general to promise to take them under his special\r\nprotection, and to guarantee them against injury to their persons or\r\nproperty. He had no power to grant them an amnesty for their past\r\nill-doing; that could be given only by the Portuguese government.\r\nWhen the latter resumed its ordinary functions at Lisbon, it was\r\nabsurd that it should be prevented, by the Convention, from taking\r\ninto consideration the cases of such of these unpatriotic persons as\r\nit might wish to deal with. When, therefore, Kellermann broached to\r\nDalrymple the sixteenth and seventeenth articles, the latter should\r\nhave refused to accept them without a reference to the Junta at Oporto.\r\nHe might have granted both the French and the Portuguese satellites of\r\nJunot a free passage out of Portugal, with such of their goods as they\r\ncould carry, but more than this he could not rationally concede on his\r\nown authority.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate, therefore, that the practical harm done did not\r\nturn out to be very great. Both the aliens and the natives covered by\r\nthese two clauses were so perfectly aware of their own unpopularity\r\nin Lisbon, that they absconded almost _en masse_. The populace of the\r\ncapital had given them fair warning of what they might expect, for\r\nnot only were they threatened and insulted in the streets whenever\r\nthey were out of sight of a French sentry, but unknown hands posted\r\non the walls lists of houses to be sacked and individuals to be hung\r\nas soon as Junot’s army should have sailed. The watchwords, ‘Death to\r\nthe French’ and ‘Death to the traitors,’ were muttered even under the\r\nmuzzles of the cannon, which had been trained on all the main streets,\r\nto keep down the insurrection for the few days which had to elapse\r\nbefore the embarkation. The invaders, therefore, had to take away with\r\nthem a very large body of civilian dependants, headed by the Comte de\r\nNovion, a French _émigré_, who, after being hospitably entertained in\r\nLisbon for many years, had shown his gratitude by accepting the post of\r\nhead of Junot’s police--a capacity in which he had much odd business to\r\ntransact.\r\n\r\nBut besides Articles XVI and XVII of the Convention there were other\r\nclauses to which Dalrymple should not have given his assent without\r\nconsulting the representatives of his allies. Almeida was being\r\nblockaded by a mass of Portuguese militia, and Elvas, a few days after\r\nthe treaty had been signed, was attacked by a Spanish force sent out\r\nfrom Badajoz by Galluzzo, the Captain-General of Estremadura. No\r\nBritish soldier had yet been seen within a hundred miles of either\r\nfortress. What was to be done if the generals of the besieging troops\r\nrefused to abide by an agreement which they had not been asked to sign,\r\nand which had not even been laid before their respective governments\r\nere it was definitively ratified? A grave crisis, as we shall find, was\r\ncreated by Dalrymple’s neglect to foresee this difficulty. His conduct\r\nall through the days of negotiation was very strange; not only did he\r\nmake no proper attempt to communicate with the Portuguese authorities,\r\nbut he actually left his own government uninformed of his proceedings\r\nfor a fortnight. He failed to send them any dispatch to announce\r\nthe armistice of August 22, and only forwarded that detailing the\r\nConvention of August 30 on the fourth day of the succeeding month.\r\n\r\nDalrymple’s main reason for leaving the Portuguese out of the\r\nnegotiations was that the Junta at Oporto had not yet been formally\r\nrecognized as the legitimate government of Portugal[259]. Wellesley,\r\nno doubt, had conferred with the Bishop, given him arms and munitions,\r\nprocured from him food and draught animals, and asked his advice, but\r\nthe British ministry had not yet acknowledged the existence of any\r\nregular executive in Portugal. This being so, Dalrymple thought himself\r\njustified in acting as if there were none in being; and it cannot be\r\ndenied that thereby he saved himself much present trouble, at the cost\r\nof future friction. All, therefore, that he did was to inform the\r\nJunta’s agent at the British head quarters, one Pinto da Souza, that he\r\nwas negotiating with Junot for the evacuation of Lisbon, and that he\r\nwas open to receive any observations which the Junta might make. The\r\nsame announcement was made to Bernardino Freire, who had ridden over\r\nto Ramalhal[260] to complain that he and his army were not mentioned\r\nin the armistice of August 22. Both Freire and the Junta were treated\r\nas persons whose opinions it was useful to obtain, not as constituted\r\nauthorities whose consent to the definitive convention was necessary\r\nin order to make it binding. Dalrymple tried to cover himself during\r\nthe subsequent inquiry by maintaining that the Convention was purely\r\nmilitary, and concerned the French and English armies alone: but this\r\nplea cannot seriously be put forward in face of Articles XV, XVI, and\r\nXVII, all of which are concerned with problems of civil government,\r\nwhich would arise after the French army should have embarked. Each\r\nof these articles clearly required the ratification of some proper\r\nPortuguese authority to make it valid.\r\n\r\n  [259] Dalrymple’s _Memoir of the Affairs of Portugal_, p. 66.\r\n\r\n  [260] Dalrymple says that he signed the armistice so soon after\r\n  landing, and with such an incomplete knowledge of the situation\r\n  in Portugal, that he did not know that Freire’s army was anywhere\r\n  in his neighbourhood (p. 65).\r\n\r\nBoth the Bishop of Oporto and General Freire were deeply wounded by the\r\nway in which Dalrymple ignored their status--the prelate more justly\r\nthan the soldier, for he had done his best to assist the British army,\r\nwhile Freire by his captious and impracticable behaviour had been more\r\nof a hindrance than a help. The Bishop charged the representative of\r\nthe Supreme Junta in London to complain to the British Government as\r\nto the behaviour of their generals, denouncing not only their neglect\r\nto make the Junta a party to the Convention, but also the terms of\r\nthat document, which were stated to be far too favourable to Junot.\r\nOwing to Dalrymple’s extraordinary delay in apprising the ministry\r\nof the details of the treaty, the Bishop’s excited denunciations of\r\nthe agreement had currency for nearly a fortnight, before any one in\r\nEngland knew what exactly had been granted to Junot, or how far the\r\nJunta was justified in its wrath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV: CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH EVACUATE PORTUGAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Convention of Cintra being once signed, the difficulties which were\r\nbound to arise from the unwisdom of some of its articles were not long\r\nin showing themselves. Indeed the first fortnight of September turned\r\nout to be a very critical time.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese authorities were furious: Dalrymple found the greatest\r\ntrouble in preventing the insurgents of the Alemtejo, who had gathered\r\nopposite the mouth of the Tagus under the Conde de Castro Marim[261],\r\nfrom attacking the French detachments in the forts on the left bank.\r\nTheir commander protested against the Convention, and actually appealed\r\nto Admiral Cotton to repudiate it: fortunately he was content to\r\nconfine his opposition to words. But there was much more trouble at\r\nElvas: the Junta of Estremadura did not object to the settlement, and\r\nliberated the French prisoners who were in its hands, according to the\r\nproposal in the eighteenth article. But Galluzzo, the Captain-General\r\nof that province, showed himself much more disobliging. He refused to\r\ncall off the troops under his lieutenant De Arce, who were beleaguering\r\nElvas, and behaved in the most dictatorial manner within Portuguese\r\nterritory, raising not only requisitions of food but contributions\r\nof money. He even seized, at Campo Mayor, the military chest of the\r\nPortuguese general Leite, who commanded the wrecks of the force that\r\nhad been beaten at Evora by Loison in July[262]. His detestable\r\nbehaviour had the good effect of throwing the natives of the country on\r\nthe English side, and Leite welcomed the arrival of troops from Lisbon,\r\nwhich enabled him to protest with effect against the misdoings and\r\nplunderings of the Spaniards. De Arce’s troops were doing no real good:\r\nthey only maintained a distant and futile bombardment of the citadel\r\nof La Lippe, in which the garrison of Elvas had taken refuge. The\r\nFrench commandant, Girod de Novillars, laughed their efforts to scorn,\r\nand refused to listen to the proposals for a capitulation which they\r\nkept pressing upon him. In spite of orders from the Junta of Seville,\r\nbidding him abandon the siege and march for Madrid with his army,\r\nGalluzzo persisted in his ridiculous proceedings till nearly the end\r\nof September. It was only when Dalrymple moved up to the neighbourhood\r\nfirst the 20th Regiment, and then two whole brigades under Sir John\r\nHope, that the Captain-General drew off his men and retired into\r\nSpanish territory [September 25]. Then Girod and his garrison, which\r\nwas mainly composed of the 4th Swiss Regiment, were able to march to\r\nLisbon under British escort and embark for France. They did not sail\r\ntill October 9, so long had Galluzzo’s freaks delayed them.\r\n\r\n  [261] Better known, from his court office, as the _Monteiro Mor_,\r\n  which answers to our ‘Master of the Horse.’\r\n\r\n  [262] See Leite’s indignant letters to Dalrymple in Napier, vol.\r\n  i. App. xii. De Arce is the real name of the Dearey of whom\r\n  Napier speaks on p. 245. Cf. Dalrymple’s _Memoir_, p. 82.\r\n\r\nThe garrison of Almeida departed about the same time: they had\r\nmaintained themselves without difficulty against the Portuguese\r\ninsurgents, but duly yielded up the place on the arrival of British\r\ntroops. They were marched down to Oporto under an escort of 200 men, a\r\nforce so weak that it nearly led to a disaster. For the mob of Oporto,\r\nunder the pretext that church plate and other public plunder was being\r\ncarried off by the French, fell upon them as they were embarking and\r\nnearly made an end of them. It required all the exertions of the\r\nescort, the Bishop of Oporto, and Sir Robert Wilson--who was then on\r\nthe spot organizing his well-known ‘Lusitanian Legion’--to prevent the\r\npopulace from boarding the transports and slaying the whole of the\r\nFrench battalion. The baggage of the departing troops was seized and\r\nplundered, and they barely succeeded in escaping with their lives[263].\r\n\r\n  [263] Foy, iv. 361, 362; Napier, i. 246, 247. Napier suppresses\r\n  the part taken in saving the French by the Bishop and by Wilson,\r\n  to neither of whom were his feelings friendly. Foy acknowledges\r\n  the services of both. There is a good account of the whole by\r\n  Wilson, in his papers at the Record Office.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, long before the garrisons of Elvas and Almeida had been\r\nbrought down to the coast, Junot and the main body of his army had\r\ndeparted. The commander-in-chief himself had sailed on September 13,\r\nthe first division of his army on the fifteenth, the rest between\r\nthat day and the thirtieth. The last weeks of the French occupation\r\nof Lisbon had been most uncomfortable for all parties concerned.\r\nThe populace was seething with discontent, assassinating isolated\r\nsoldiers, and threatening a general rising. The French were under\r\narms day and night, with cannon trained down every street and square.\r\nUnpopular officers, such as Loison, could not stir from their quarters\r\nwithout a large escort. Sullen at their defeat, and still more angry\r\nat having to abandon the heaps of plunder which they had amassed, the\r\nFrench were in a most disobliging mood in their dealings with the\r\nPortuguese, and in a less degree with the English. The main source of\r\nirritation was the very necessary measures which had to be taken for\r\nsearching the baggage of the departing army. A commission had been\r\nformed, consisting of Kellermann on the one side and General Beresford\r\nand Lord Proby on the other, to settle in all disputed cases what was\r\nmilitary equipment and legitimate personal property, and what was not.\r\nThe English commissioners discovered the most astounding hoards of\r\nmiscellaneous goods among the bags and boxes of the invaders[264]. The\r\nconduct of most of the French officers, from the commander-in-chief\r\ndownwards, was most disgraceful. A few examples may suffice: Junot,\r\nby the twenty-first article of the Convention, had been granted leave\r\nto send a single officer to France with news for the Emperor. This\r\nofficer, his aide-de-camp Lagrave, took with him for his general’s\r\nprivate profit the most valuable set of books in the Royal Library\r\nof Lisbon, fourteen volumes of a manuscript Bible of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, illustrated with miniatures by the best Florentine artists--a\r\ngift to King Emanuel from one of the Renaissance popes. Junot’s widow\r\nafterwards sold it to the French government for 85,000 francs. Lagrave,\r\nhaving started before the commissioners had begun to work, got off with\r\nhis boxes unsearched. But other interesting items were discovered in\r\nthe baggage of the Duke of Abrantes--one was £5,000 worth of indigo in\r\nfifty-three large chests, another was a quantity of valuable specimens\r\nof natural history from the public museum. General Delaborde was found\r\nto be in possession of a large collection of sacred pictures which had\r\nadorned Lisbon churches. Scattered through the baggage of many officers\r\nwas a quantity of church plate--apparently part of the property\r\nseized to pay the war contributions which Napoleon had imposed on\r\nPortugal: but it had in some mysterious way passed from public into\r\nprivate possession[265]. In the military chest were gold bars to the\r\nvalue of 1,000,000 francs which had come from the same source, but the\r\npaymaster-general tried to get them out of the country without paying\r\nthe numerous accounts owed by his department to private individuals in\r\nLisbon. They were not discharged till this individual, one Thonnellier,\r\nhad been put under arrest, and threatened with detention after the\r\nrest of the army should have sailed[266]. Another most scandalous\r\nproceeding discovered by the commissioners was that Junot, after the\r\nsignature of the Convention, had broken open the Deposito Publico, the\r\nchest of the Supreme Court of Lisbon, which contained moneys whose\r\nrightful ownership was in dispute between private litigants. He took\r\nfrom it coin to the value of £25,000, which was only wrung out of\r\nhim with the greatest difficulty. Even after a vast amount had been\r\nrecovered, the French sailed with a military chest containing pay for\r\nthree months ahead for the whole army, though they had entered Portugal\r\npenniless. For a general picture of their behaviour it may suffice to\r\nquote the report of the British commissioners. ‘The conduct of the\r\nFrench has been marked by the most shameful disregard of honour and\r\nprobity, publicly evincing their intention of departing with their\r\nbooty, and leaving acknowledged debts unpaid. Finally they only paid\r\nwhat they were obliged to disgorge.... Unmindful of every tie of\r\nhonour or justice, the French army has taken away a considerable sum\r\nin its military chest, still leaving its debts unpaid to a very large\r\namount[267].’\r\n\r\n  [264] Napier, with his customary tenderness for French\r\n  susceptibilities, has only very general allusions to these\r\n  disgraceful peculations. My details are mainly from Thiébault\r\n  (iv. 198-200), who frankly confesses everything, and gives many\r\n  scandalous particulars. He was, as Napoleon wrote, ‘not delicate\r\n  in money matters.’\r\n\r\n  [265] Cf. Thiébault, Napier, and some curious details given in\r\n  the _Annual Register_ for 1808, with Proby and Beresford’s Report.\r\n\r\n  [266] For previous acts and plans of this shameless person see\r\n  Thiébault, iv. 151-3.\r\n\r\n  [267] Report of General Beresford and Lord Proby to Sir Hew\r\n  Dalrymple after the evacuation.\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder that the resentment of the Portuguese was so great\r\nthat the last French who embarked could only get away under the\r\nprotection of British bayonets, and that many of those who straggled\r\nor lingered too long in remote corners of the town lost their lives.\r\nThe wild fury of the Lisbon mob surprised the British officers who\r\nwere charged with the embarkation[268]: they knew little of what had\r\nbeen going on in the capital for the last nine months, and could not\r\nunderstand the mad rage displayed against the garrison.\r\n\r\n  [268] For the tumults and murders at the embarkation see Col.\r\n  Leslie’s _Military Journal_, pp. 66-76, and Col. Wilkie’s\r\n  _English in Spain_, p. 16.\r\n\r\nBut finally the last French bayonet disappeared from the streets of\r\nLisbon, and the populace, with no object left on which to vent their\r\nfury, turned to illuminations, feasts, and the childish delights of\r\nfireworks. They did not show themselves ungrateful to the army of\r\nliberation; all the British officers who have described the first\r\nweeks after the evacuation of Lisbon, bear witness to the enthusiasm\r\nwith which they were received, and the good feeling displayed by their\r\nallies[269]. It was only in the highest Portuguese quarters that\r\ndissatisfaction was rampant: the Bishop of Oporto, General Freire, and\r\nthe Monteiro Mor, had all suffered what they considered an insult,\r\nwhen their consent was not asked to the Convention of Cintra, and made\r\nno secret of their anger against Dalrymple. But it does not seem that\r\ntheir feelings affected any large section of the people.\r\n\r\n  [269] See Col. Steevens’ _Reminiscences_, pp. 54, 55; Col.\r\n  Wilkie, p. 14; Col. Leslie, pp. 65, 66.\r\n\r\nThe French army embarked for its native soil still 25,747 strong.\r\nIt had entered Portugal in the previous November with a strength of\r\nnearly 25,000, and had received during the spring of 1808 some 4,500\r\nrecruits: in the month of May, before hostilities began, its full\r\nforce had been 26,594[270]. Of this total 20,090 were under arms at\r\nthe moment that the Convention was signed, 3,522 were in hospital,\r\nsick or wounded: 916 were prisoners in the hands of the English or the\r\nPortuguese. There remain, therefore, some 4,500 men to be accounted\r\nfor: these, however, were not all dead. More than 500 had deserted\r\nand taken service with the British before the embarkation: they\r\ncame, almost without exception, from the ranks of the three foreign\r\nbattalions which had been serving with Junot, the 1st Hanoverians and\r\nthe 2nd and 4th Swiss[271]. As the total force of these corps had been\r\nonly 2,548, it is clear that about one man in five deserted. This was\r\nnatural in the case of the Germans, who were old subjects of George\r\nIII, and most unwilling recruits to the French army, but the equally\r\nwell-marked defection of the Swiss is very notable. Most of the\r\nlatter were enlisted for the 5th Battalion of the 60th Rifles, while\r\nthe Hanoverians joined their countrymen in the ranks of the King’s\r\nGerman Legion[272]. The real deficit, then, in Junot’s army was about\r\n4,000 men: this represents the total loss of life by the fights of\r\nRoliça and Vimiero, by the numerous combats with the Portuguese, by the\r\nstragglers cut off during the forced marches of July and August, and by\r\nthe ordinary mortality in hospital. It must be considered on the whole\r\na very moderate casualty list: Junot’s corps, when it re-entered Spain\r\nto serve once more under the Emperor, was still 22,000 strong. It would\r\nhave been even a trifle higher in numbers if a transport carrying two\r\ncompanies of the 86th Regiment had not foundered at sea, with the loss\r\nof every man on board.\r\n\r\n  [270] _Well. Suppl. Disp._, vi. 207 (figures given for May 23),\r\n  and Thiébault.\r\n\r\n  [271] Napier, i. 246; Foy, iv. 363. We have already had occasion\r\n  to note the proclivity of the 2nd Swiss to desert. The 4th Swiss,\r\n  who had formed the garrison of Elvas, showed exactly the same\r\n  tendency.\r\n\r\n  [272] A table in the _Parliamentary Papers relative to Spain and\r\n  Portugal_ shows that the Legion received 163 recruits from this\r\n  source. The 5/60th obtained a much larger number, having still\r\n  over 200 Swiss with them in 1809.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to give some account of the fate of Siniavin’s Russian\r\nsquadron, before dismissing the topic of the evacuation of Portugal.\r\nThe admiral, as we have already had occasion to state, had steadfastly\r\nrefused to throw in his lot with Junot and to join in the Convention\r\nof Cintra. He preferred to make an agreement of his own with Sir\r\nCharles Cotton. It was a simple document of two articles: the first\r\nprovided that the nine sail of the line and one frigate, which formed\r\nthe Russian fleet, should be given up, sent to England, and ‘held as a\r\ndeposit’ by his Britannic majesty, to be restored within six months of\r\na peace between Great Britain and Russia. The second was to the effect\r\nthat Siniavin, his officers and crews, should be sent back to Russia on\r\nEnglish ships without being in any way considered prisoners of war, or\r\ndebarred from further service.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Cotton, it is clear, regarded the ships as important and the\r\ncrews as worthy of small attention. It was profitable to Great Britain\r\nto keep down the number of vessels in the power of Napoleon, though now\r\nthat the Danish fleet was captured, and the Spanish fleet transferred\r\nto the other side of the balance, there could be no longer any\r\nimmediate danger of the French taking the offensive at sea. The easy\r\nterms of release granted to the _personnel_ of the Russian squadron\r\nsuggest that the British admiral had determined to reward its commander\r\nfor his persistent refusal to help Junot. It almost appears that Cotton\r\nlooked upon Siniavin as a secret friend, and treated him accordingly.\r\nMilder terms could hardly have been devised, for the moment that the\r\nharbour-forts of Lisbon were surrendered to the British, the Russians\r\nmust obviously be made prisoners, since they could not get out of the\r\nriver. It is probable that the two admirals thoroughly understood each\r\nother’s mind, and that the Russian was undisguisedly pleased at the\r\ndisaster of his detested French allies.\r\n\r\nThe most pressing necessity in Portugal, after the French had departed,\r\nwas the construction of a new national government, for it was clear\r\nthat the Supreme Junta at Oporto represented in reality only the\r\nnorthern provinces of the realm, and could not be accepted--as its\r\npresident, the Bishop, suggested--as a permanent and legitimate\r\nexecutive for the whole kingdom. Constitutionally speaking, if one\r\nmay use such a phrase when dealing with a country like Portugal, the\r\nonly body which possessed a clear title of authority was the Council\r\nof Regency, which Prince John had nominated nine months before, on the\r\neve of his departure for Brazil. But this council had long ceased to\r\nact; its members were dispersed; several had compromised themselves\r\nby submitting to the French and taking office under Junot; and its\r\ncomposition gave no promise of vigorous action for the future. If a\r\nchoice must be made between the Junta at Oporto, which was active and\r\npatriotic, though perhaps too much given up to self-assertion and\r\nintrigue, and the effete old Regency, there could be no doubt that\r\nthe former possessed more claims to the confidence of the Portuguese\r\nnation and its English allies. But it was not necessary to adopt\r\neither alternative in full: Wellesley, who had already got a firm\r\ngrip upon the outlines of Portuguese politics, advised Dalrymple to\r\ninvite the old Regency, with the exception of those members who had\r\ncompromised themselves with the French, to reassemble, and to bring\r\npressure upon them to co-opt to the vacant places the Bishop of Oporto\r\nand the other prominent members of the Junta. This proposal would have\r\nsecured legality of form (since the old Regency would theoretically\r\nhave continued to exist), while introducing new and vigorous elements\r\nof undoubted patriotism into the body[273]. But Dalrymple preferred to\r\nreinstate, by a proclamation of his own, those members of the Regency\r\nwho had never wavered in their allegiance to Prince John [Sept. 18].\r\nHe called upon all public bodies and officials in the realm to obey\r\nthis reconstituted executive. Here was an undoubted mistake; it was\r\nwounding to Portuguese pride to see the central governing body of\r\nthe kingdom created by the edict of an English general: Dalrymple\r\nshould surely have allowed the Regents to apprise the nation, by\r\na proclamation of their own, that they had resumed their former\r\nfunctions. However, they fell in with Wellesley’s plans so far as\r\nto co-opt the Bishop of Oporto as a colleague, though refusing any\r\nplaces to the rest of his Junta. The whole body now consisted of\r\nthree original members, the Conde de Castro Marim (otherwise known\r\nas the Monteiro Mor), Francisco Da Cunha, and Xavier de Noronha, of\r\ntwo persons chosen from a list of possible substitutes, which the\r\nPrince-Regent had left behind, Joam de Mendonça and General Miguel\r\nForjas Coutinho, and of two co-opted members, the Bishop and the Conde\r\ndas Minas, an old nobleman who had shown a very determined spirit in\r\nresisting Junot during the days of his power.\r\n\r\n  [273] Wellesley to Lord Castlereagh, Sept. 9 (_Well. Disp._, iv.\r\n  137). In spite of Napier’s denunciation of the Bishop, Wellesley\r\n  bears good witness in his favour, e.g. iv. 146.\r\n\r\nOn the reconstitution of the Regency the Junta of Oporto, with more\r\nself-denial than had been expected, dissolved itself. The minor\r\njuntas in the Algarve, the Alemtejo, and the Tras-os-Montes followed\r\nits example, and Portugal was once more in possession of a single\r\nexecutive, whose authority was freely recognized throughout the\r\nkingdom. Unfortunately it turned out to be slow, timid, and divided\r\ninto cliques which were always at variance with each other.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that owing to various causes of delay, of which\r\nGalluzzo’s preposterous proceedings at Elvas were the most prominent,\r\nthe last French troops did not quit Portugal till September had\r\nexpired, and that Junot himself and the main body of his army had only\r\nbegun to leave on the fifteenth of that month. It would have been\r\nimpossible for Dalrymple to advance into Spain till the French had left\r\nLisbon, however urgently his presence might have been required. But it\r\nwould perhaps have proved feasible to push forward towards the Spanish\r\nfrontier a considerable part of his army, and to make preparations for\r\nthe movement of the whole towards Madrid or Salamanca as soon as the\r\nevacuation should be complete. Dalrymple, however, was as leisurely\r\nas the generals of the old days before the Revolutionary War. He kept\r\nhis troops cantoned about Lisbon, only pushing forward two brigades\r\ntowards Elvas in order to bring Galluzzo to reason, and dispatching\r\nthe 6th Regiment as a garrison to Almeida. He seems to have been\r\nquite as much interested in the administration of Portugal as in the\r\nfurther prosecution of the war in Spain. We find him much busied in\r\nthe reconstruction of the Portuguese government and army, reviewing\r\nand rearming the Spanish division of Caraffa before shipping it off\r\nto Catalonia [Sept. 22], and spending a great deal of time over the\r\nredistribution into brigades and divisions of his army, which had now\r\nswelled to something like 35,000 men, by the arrival of Moore’s force\r\nand certain regiments from Madeira, Gibraltar, and England. He was also\r\nengaged in endeavours to organize a proper commissariat for this large\r\nbody of men, a hard task, for every brigade arrived in the same state\r\nof destitution as to means of transport as had those which landed with\r\nWellesley at Mondego Bay on the first of August. But in all his actions\r\nthere was evident a want of vigour and of purposeful resource, which\r\nwas very distressing to those of his subordinates who were anxious for\r\na rapid and decisive advance towards the main theatre of war in Spain.\r\n\r\nNo one felt this more clearly than Wellesley, whose views as to his\r\ncommander’s competence had never changed since that hour on the morning\r\nof August 22, when Dalrymple had refused to march on Mafra, and had\r\ndecided to delay his advance till the advent of Moore. Since then he\r\nhad offered his advice on several points, and had almost always seen it\r\nrefused. Dealing with the disputed details of the Convention of Cintra,\r\nhe had spoken in favour of meeting the French demands with high-handed\r\ndecision: hence he was vexed by Dalrymple’s tendency towards weakness\r\nand compromise. One of his special grievances was that he had been\r\nordered to sign the armistice of August 22 as representing the British\r\narmy, although he had privately protested against its details[274]. His\r\nunofficial letters home during the first half of September are full of\r\nbitter remarks on the weakness of the policy that had been adopted, and\r\nthe many faults of the Convention[275]. Seeing that warlike operations\r\nappeared likely to be postponed for an indefinite time, he at last\r\nasked and obtained leave to return to England, after declining in\r\nsomewhat acid terms an offer made to him by Dalrymple that he should\r\ngo to Madrid, to concert a plan for combined operations with Castaños\r\nand the other Spanish generals. ‘In order to be able to perform the\r\nimportant part allotted to him,’ he wrote, ‘the person sent should\r\npossess the confidence of those who employ him, and be acquainted with\r\ntheir plans, the means by which they hope to carry them into execution,\r\nand those by which they intend to enable the Spanish nation to execute\r\nthat which will be proposed to them. I certainly cannot consider myself\r\nas possessing these advantages[276].’ Wellesley also refused another\r\nand a less tempting offer of a mission to the Asturias, for the purpose\r\nof seeing what facilities that province would offer as the base of\r\noperations for a British army. He was not a ‘draftsman,’ he wrote, or\r\na ‘topographical engineer,’ and he could not pretend to describe in\r\nwriting the character of such a region. In short he was set on going\r\nhome, and would not turn from his purpose. But before leaving Portugal\r\nhe wrote two remarkable letters. One was to Sir John Moore, the third\r\nin command of the army, telling him that he regarded him as the right\r\nperson to take charge of the British forces in the Peninsula, and would\r\nuse every effort with the ministers to get the post secured to him.\r\n‘It is quite impossible that we can go on as we are now constituted:\r\nthe commander-in-chief must be changed, and the country and the army\r\nnaturally turn their eyes to you as their commander[277].’ The second\r\nand longer was a letter to his patron Castlereagh, in which he laid\r\ndown his views as to the general state of the war in Spain, and the way\r\nin which the British army could be best employed. It is a wonderful\r\ndocument, as he foretells in it all the disasters that were about to\r\nbefall the Spaniards from their reckless self-confidence. The only\r\nreal fighting-force that they possessed was, he said, the army of\r\nCastaños: the rest, with the possible exception of Blake’s Galicians,\r\nwere ‘armies of peasantry,’ which could not be relied upon to meet the\r\nFrench in the field. Though they might on some occasions fight with\r\nsuccess in their own mountains, ‘yet in others a thousand French with\r\ncavalry and artillery will disperse thousands of them.’ They would not,\r\nand indeed could not, leave their native provinces, and no officer\r\ncould calculate upon them for the carrying out of a great combined\r\noperation. How then could the British army of Portugal be best employed\r\nto aid such allies? The only efficient plan, Wellesley concludes, would\r\nbe to place it upon the flank and rear of any French advance to Madrid,\r\nby moving it up to the valley of the Douro, and basing it upon Asturias\r\nand Galicia. Posted in the kingdom of Leon, with its ports of supply at\r\nGihon, Corunna, and Ferrol, it should co-operate with Blake, and hang\r\nupon the right flank of the French army which was forming upon the line\r\nof the Ebro. The result would be to prevent the invaders from moving\r\nforward, even perhaps (here Wellesley erred from ignorance of the\r\nenemy’s numbers) to oblige them to retire towards their own frontier.\r\nBut Bonaparte could, unless occupied by the affairs of Central Europe,\r\nincrease his armies in Spain to any extent. The moment that he heard\r\nof an English force in the field, he would consider its destruction as\r\nhis first object, and so multiply his numbers in the Peninsula that\r\nthe British commander would have to give back. ‘There must be a line\r\nof retreat open, and that retreat must be the sea.’ Accordingly, Sir\r\nArthur recommended that the Asturias should be made the ultimate base,\r\nand the transports and stores sent to its port of Gihon[278].\r\n\r\n  [274] Wellesley to the Bishop of Oporto, Sept. 6: ‘I was present\r\n  during the negotiation of the agreement, and by the desire of the\r\n  Commander-in-chief I signed it. But I did not negotiate it, nor\r\n  can I in any manner be considered responsible for its contents’\r\n  (_Well. Disp._, iv. 134). Wellesley to Castlereagh, Oct. 6: ‘I do\r\n  not consider myself responsible in any degree for the terms in\r\n  which it was framed, or for any of its provisions.’\r\n\r\n  [275] Wellesley to Mr. Stuart (_Well. Disp._, iv. 120). To Lord\r\n  Castlereagh (iv. 118). To the Duke of Richmond (_Suppl. Disp._,\r\n  vi. 129).\r\n\r\n  [276] Wellesley to Dalrymple _(Well. Disp._, iv. 138).\r\n\r\n  [277] Wellesley to Moore, Sept. 17, 1808 (_Well. Disp._, p. 142).\r\n  Moore, as a noted Whig, was imagined not to be a _persona grata_\r\n  at head quarters; Wellesley offers, in the most handsome way, to\r\n  endeavour to smooth matters for him.\r\n\r\n  [278] This letter, written to Castlereagh from Zambujal (_Well.\r\n  Disp._, iv. 127-32), is one of the most conclusive proofs of\r\n  Wellesley’s military genius. He valued the Spanish armies at\r\n  their true force. He foresaw that Bonaparte would make ‘the\r\n  driving of the leopard into the sea’ a point of honour, and\r\n  would send corps on corps into Spain in order to secure it. He\r\n  even noted that the affairs of Central Europe, ‘of which I have\r\n  no knowledge whatever,’ would be the only possible reason that\r\n  might prevent the Emperor from inundating the Peninsula with his\r\n  legions. He saw that the presence of the British in Leon would be\r\n  the one thing that would keep the French from subduing Central\r\n  Spain: a disaster in the Douro valley was the nightmare of the\r\n  Emperor, as half a dozen of his dispatches show. The first news\r\n  that Moore was near Valladolid drew Napoleon from Madrid in wild\r\n  haste, and deferred for six months the conquest of the valley of\r\n  the Guadiana.\r\n\r\nThis letter was different in its general character from the other\r\nreports which Castlereagh was receiving: most of the correspondents\r\nof the Secretary for War could write of nothing but the enthusiastic\r\npatriotism of the Spaniards and their enormous resources: they spoke\r\nof the French as a dispirited remnant, ready to fly, at the first\r\nattack, behind the line of the Pyrenees. It is therefore greatly to\r\nthe credit of Castlereagh that he did not hesitate to pin his faith\r\nupon Wellesley’s intelligence, and to order the execution of the very\r\nplan that he recommended. It was practically carried out in the great\r\ncampaign of Sir John Moore, after the collapse of the Spanish armies\r\nhad justified every word that Sir Arthur had written about them.\r\n\r\nWellesley sailed from Lisbon on September 20, and reached Plymouth on\r\nOctober 4. On his arrival in England he was met with news of a very\r\nmixed character. On the one hand he was rejoiced to hear that both\r\nDalrymple and Burrard had been recalled, and that Sir John Moore had\r\nbeen placed in command of the British forces in the Peninsula. He\r\nwrote at once to the latter, to say that there could be no greater\r\nsatisfaction than to serve under his orders, and that he would return\r\nat once to Spain to join him: ‘he would forward with zeal every wish’\r\nof his new commander[279]. It was also most gratifying to Wellesley to\r\nknow that the dispatch of September 25, by which Moore was given the\r\ncommand of the army of Portugal, directed him to move into Northern\r\nSpain and base himself upon the Asturias and Galicia, the very plan\r\nwhich formed the main thesis of the document that we have been\r\ndiscussing. There can be no doubt that Castlereagh had recognized the\r\nstrategical and political verities that were embodied in Wellesley’s\r\nletter, and had resolved to adopt the line therein recommended.\r\n\r\n  [279] Wellesley to Moore, Oct. 8 (_Well. Suppl. Disp._, vi. 150,\r\n  151).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV: CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE COURT OF INQUIRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was another and a less pleasant surprise in store for Wellesley\r\nwhen he landed at Plymouth. He learnt that if he himself disliked the\r\narmistice of August 22, and the Convention of Cintra, the British\r\npublic had gone far beyond him, and was in a state of frantic rage\r\nconcerning them. To his anger and amazement he also learnt that he\r\nhimself was considered no less responsible for the two agreements than\r\nwere Dalrymple and Burrard. The fact that the former had told him to\r\nset his signature opposite to that of Kellermann on the document signed\r\nat Vimiero, had misled the world into regarding him as the negotiator\r\nand framer of the armistice. ‘Every whisperer who disliked the name of\r\nWellesley[280]’--and Sir Arthur’s brother, the Governor-General, had\r\nmade it very unpopular in certain quarters--was busy propagating the\r\nstory that of the three generals who had lately commanded in Portugal,\r\neach one was as slack and supine as the others.\r\n\r\n  [280] The Duke of Richmond to Wellesley, Oct. 12, 1808 (_Well.\r\n  Suppl. Disp._, vi. 633).\r\n\r\nThe wave of indignation which swept across England on the receipt of\r\nthe news of the Convention of Cintra is, at this distance of time, a\r\nlittle hard to understand. Successes had not been so plentiful on the\r\nContinent during the last fifteen years, that an agreement which gave\r\nback its liberty to a whole kingdom need have been criticized with\r\nvindictive minuteness. But the news of Baylen had set the public mind\r\non the look-out for further triumphs, and when the dispatches which\r\ngave an account of Roliça and of Vimiero had come to hand, there had\r\nbeen a confident expectation that the next news received would be that\r\nJunot’s army had been scattered or captured, and that Lisbon had been\r\nset free. Then came a gap of thirteen days, caused by Dalrymple’s\r\nstrange fit of silence. The only intelligence that reached London in\r\nthis interval was the Bishop of Oporto’s letter of protest against the\r\narmistice, in which, without giving any definite details about that\r\nagreement, he denounced it as insulting to Portugal and unworthy of\r\nEngland. The public was prepared, therefore, to hear that something\r\ntimid and base had been done, when Dalrymple’s dispatch of September\r\n3, enclosing the Convention of Cintra, came to hand. It was easy to\r\nset forth the terms of that treaty in an odious light. Junot, it was\r\nsaid, had been beaten in the field, he was completely isolated from all\r\nthe other French armies, and his surrender must have followed in a few\r\ndays, if the British generals had only chosen to press their advantage.\r\nInstead of this, they preferred to let him return to France with the\r\nwhole of his troops, and with most of his plunder. He was not even\r\ncompelled to release a corresponding number of British prisoners in\r\nreturn for the freedom secured to his army. In fact, his position was\r\nmuch better after than before his defeat at Vimiero, for the Convention\r\ngranted him a quiet and safe return home with his force intact, while,\r\neven if he had won some success in battle, the best that he would have\r\nbeen able to secure himself would have been a retreat on Northern\r\nSpain, through the midst of great dangers. Excitable politicians and\r\njournalists used the most exaggerated language, and compared the\r\nConvention with that of Kloster Seven, and the conduct of the generals\r\nwho had not pressed the campaign to its logical end with Admiral Byng’s\r\nshirking before Minorca. Caricatures were issued showing Dalrymple,\r\nBurrard, and Wellesley sporting the white feather, or hanging from\r\nthree gibbets as traitors[281]. Nor was Admiral Cotton spared: he was\r\ndenounced in bitter terms for taking the Russian ships as ‘deposits,’\r\nwhen he should have towed them into Spithead as prizes: moreover the\r\nrepatriation of the Russian crews was asserted to be a deadly blow at\r\nour unfortunate ally the King of Sweden.\r\n\r\n  [281] Toreño, then acting as agent for the Asturian Junta in\r\n  London, has much interesting information on this point. He saw\r\n  the gibbet caricature and papers published with black edges (i.\r\n  251).\r\n\r\nThe rage against the Convention was not confined to any one class or\r\nfaction in the state. If some Whigs tried to turn it into the shape of\r\nan attack on the government, there were plenty of Tories who joined in\r\nthe cry, begging their leaders in the ministry to dismiss and punish\r\nthe three unpopular generals. A number of public meetings were held\r\nwith the object of forcing the hands of the Duke of Portland and his\r\ncolleagues, but the most prominent part in the agitation was taken\r\nby the Corporation of London. Recalling the old days of Wilkes and\r\nBeckford, they resolved that the Lord Mayor, with a deputation of\r\nSheriffs, Aldermen, and Common-Councillors, should present a petition\r\nto the King begging him to order ‘an inquiry into this dishonourable\r\nand unprecedented transaction, for the discovery and punishment of\r\nthose by whose misconduct and incapacity the cause of the kingdom and\r\nits allies has been so shamelessly sacrificed.’\r\n\r\nAccordingly such a petition was laid before the King on October 12.\r\nIts terms are worth a moment’s attention, as they show very clearly\r\nthe points on which popular indignation had been concentrated. ‘The\r\ntreaty,’ it states, ‘is humiliating and degrading, because after\r\na signal victory, by which the enemy appears to have been cut off\r\nfrom all means of succour or escape, we had the sad mortification of\r\nseeing the laurels so nobly acquired torn from the brows of our brave\r\nsoldiers, and terms granted to the enemy disgraceful to the British\r\nname.... By this ignominious Convention British ships are to convey to\r\nFrance the French army and its plunder, where they will be at liberty\r\nimmediately to recommence their active operations against us and our\r\nallies. And the full recognition of the title and dignity of Emperor\r\nof France[282], while all mention of the Government of Portugal is\r\nomitted, must be considered as highly disrespectful to the authorities\r\nof that country.’ There was another clause denouncing the sending back\r\nof the Russian sailors, but not so much stress was laid on this point.\r\nFinally the King is asked ‘in justice to the outraged feelings of a\r\nbrave, injured, and indignant people, whose blood and treasure have\r\nbeen thus expended,’ to cause the guilty persons to be punished.\r\n\r\n  [282] The petitioners ought in fairness to have stated that this\r\n  was only made in the document setting forth the armistice, and\r\n  not in the definitive Convention.\r\n\r\nKing George III replied to these flowers of oratory by a short speech\r\nwhich displays admirably that power of getting an occasional lucid\r\nglimpse of the obvious in which he was by no means deficient. He\r\nwas fully sensible, he said, of the loyalty and good intentions of\r\nthe City of London, but he wished the deputation to remember that\r\nto pronounce judgement without previous trial and investigation was\r\nhardly consonant with the principles of British justice. He was always\r\nready to institute an inquiry when the honour of the British arms was\r\nin question: and the interposition of the City of London was not\r\nnecessary to induce him to set one on foot in this case, when the hopes\r\nand expectations of the nation had been so much disappointed.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, till seventeen days later that his majesty’s\r\nformal orders for the summoning of a Court of Inquiry ‘to investigate\r\ninto the late Armistice and Convention concluded in Portugal, and\r\nall the circumstances connected therewith,’ were communicated to\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief. Dalrymple and Burrard, both of whom had now\r\nreturned to England, were directed to hold themselves in readiness\r\nto present themselves before the court, and Wellesley, for the same\r\nreason, was directed to abandon his project of going back to the\r\nPeninsula in order to serve under Sir John Moore.\r\n\r\nThe members of the celebrated Court of Inquiry, which commenced its\r\nsittings on November 14, 1808, were seven in number, all general\r\nofficers of great respectability and advanced years, men more likely,\r\nfor the most part, to sympathize with caution than with daring. The\r\npresident was Sir David Dundas, the author of a celebrated drill-book\r\nwhich had long been the terror of young officers: the other members\r\nwere Lord Moira, Lord Heathfield[283], the Earl of Pembroke, and\r\nGenerals Craig, Sir G. Nugent, and Nicholls. Not one of them has left\r\nbehind a name to be remembered, save indeed Lord Moira, who, as Lord\r\nRawdon in the old American War, had won the victory of Hobkirk’s Hill,\r\nand who was destined to be the next Viceroy of India and to make the\r\nname of Hastings famous for a second time in the East.\r\n\r\n  [283] Not, of course, the Eliot who had defended Gibraltar so\r\n  well in 1780-3, but his son, the second Lord Heathfield.\r\n\r\nThe court began its sittings on November 14, and did not terminate\r\nthem till December 22. In the great hall of Chelsea Hospital, where\r\nits proceedings were held, there was much warm debate. As the details\r\nof the Campaign of Portugal were gradually worked out, not only by the\r\ncross-examination of Dalrymple, Burrard, and Wellesley, but by that of\r\nmany of the other officers of rank who had been in Portugal--Spencer,\r\nAcland, Ferguson, Lord Burghersh, and others--the points on which\r\nthe verdict of the court must turn gradually became clear. They were\r\nsix in number:--Had Burrard been justified in preventing Wellesley\r\nfrom pursuing the French at the end of the battle of Vimiero? Had\r\nDalrymple erred in refusing to take Wellesley’s advice to march on\r\nMafra the next morning? Should Kellermann’s offer of an armistice\r\nhave been accepted on the twenty-second, and, if so, were the terms\r\ngranted him too favourable? Lastly, was the Convention of Cintra\r\nitself justifiable under the existing circumstances, and were all\r\nits articles reasonable and proper? Much evidence was produced for\r\nand against each view on every one of these topics. On the first two\r\nWellesley practically impeached Burrard and Dalrymple for unwarrantable\r\nslackness and timidity. He was so much in love with his own bold plans\r\nthat his superior’s caution appeared to him contemptible. He stood up\r\nto them and cross-questioned them with an acidity and a complete want\r\nof deference that seemed very reprehensible to military men steeped in\r\nthe old traditions of unquestioning deference to one’s senior officers.\r\nSir Walter Scott, who followed the inquiry with great interest, called\r\nhim ‘a haughty devil,’ but expressed his admiration for him at the\r\nsame moment[284]. It is curious to find that Wellesley showed less\r\nanger with Burrard, whose caution on the afternoon of the twenty-first\r\nreally wrecked his plan of campaign, than with Dalrymple. The latter\r\nhad snubbed him on his first arrival, had persistently refused him\r\nhis confidence, and would not state clearly to the court that the\r\narmistice, though it bore Wellesley’s name, had not been drawn up or\r\napproved in detail by him. Of the numerous minor witnesses who were\r\nexamined, all who had served at Roliça and Vimiero spoke on Wellesley’s\r\nside: Spencer and Ferguson were especially strong in their statements.\r\nThe fact was that they were intensely proud of their two fights, and\r\nlooked upon Burrard as the man who had prevented them from entering\r\nLisbon in triumph after capturing Junot and his whole host. So strong\r\nwas this feeling that the brigadiers and field-officers of the eight\r\nbrigades that fought at Vimiero had presented Wellesley with a handsome\r\ntestimonial--a service of plate worth £1,000--as a sort of mark of\r\nconfidence in him, and of protest against those who had stayed his hand.\r\n\r\n  [284] Lockhart’s _Life of Sir Walter Scott_, ii. 226.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Burrard and Dalrymple urged all the justifications\r\nof caution. Each had arrived at a crisis, the details of which could\r\nnot be properly known to him from sheer want of time to master them.\r\nEach acknowledged that Wellesley had vehemently pressed him to strike\r\nboldly and promptly, but thought that he had not been justified in\r\ndoing so till he had made out for himself the exact situation of\r\naffairs. Burrard pleaded that Junot might have possessed reserves\r\nunknown to him, which might have changed the fortune of the fight\r\nif a headlong pursuit had been ordered. Wellesley had told him that\r\nnone such existed (and this turned out to have been the fact), but he\r\nhimself had not seen any clear proof of it at the time[285]. Dalrymple\r\nwent even further, and stated that he had considered the whole conduct\r\nof the campaign, from the landing in Mondego Bay till the battle of\r\nVimiero, terribly rash[286]. If he had permitted the army to march on\r\nMafra on the twenty-second, the French from Torres Vedras might have\r\ntaken him in the flank as he passed through a very difficult country,\r\nand the most disastrous results might have ensued. He was positive\r\nthat nothing hazardous ought to have been attempted, and that it was\r\nnecessary to wait for Sir John Moore’s division before pressing the\r\nFrench to extremity.\r\n\r\n  [285] Burrard before the Court of Inquiry (_Proceedings_, pp.\r\n  115, 116, 135).\r\n\r\n  [286] Dalrymple before the Court of Inquiry (_Well. Disp._, iv.\r\n  178, 180, 181).\r\n\r\nWith regard to the armistice and the Convention, all the three\r\ngenerals, when defending themselves, agreed that they were wise and\r\njustifiable. To clear the French out of Portugal without further\r\nfighting, and to recover Lisbon and all its resources intact, were\r\nends so important that it was well worth while to sacrifice even the\r\npractical certainty of capturing all Junot’s army, after a resistance\r\nthat might have been long and desperate. But as to the wisdom of\r\ncertain clauses and articles, both in the document of August 22 and\r\nthat of August 30, there was considerable difference of opinion.\r\nWellesley proved that he had opposed many details of each agreement,\r\nand that he was in no way responsible for the final shape taken by\r\nthem. He only assented to the general proposition that it was right to\r\nlet the French army depart under a convention, rather than to force it\r\nto a capitulation. He considered that Dalrymple had yielded far too\r\nmuch, from his unwillingness to ‘drive Junot into a corner.’\r\n\r\nOn December 22 the Court of Inquiry issued its report. It was a very\r\ncautious and a rather inconclusive document. But its main point\r\nwas that nothing had been done in Portugal which called for the\r\npunishment of any of the parties concerned: ‘On a consideration of\r\nall the circumstances, we most humbly submit our opinion that no\r\nfurther military proceeding is necessary,’ i.e. there was no ground\r\nfor a court-martial on any one of the three British generals. As to\r\nBurrard’s refusal to pursue the French on the afternoon of Vimiero,\r\nthere were ‘fair military grounds’ for his decision: the court omitted\r\nto say whether the decision itself was right or wrong. ‘It could not\r\npronounce with confidence whether or not a pursuit could have been\r\nefficacious.’ As to the halt on the following day, for which Dalrymple\r\nno less than Burrard was responsible, ‘under the extraordinary\r\ncircumstances that two new commanding generals arrived from the ocean\r\nand joined the army within the space of twenty-four hours, it is not\r\nsurprising that the army was not carried forward until the second\r\nday after the action, from the necessity of the generals becoming\r\nacquainted with the actual state of things, and of their army, and\r\nproceeding accordingly.’ Finally, as to the Convention, ‘howsoever\r\nsome of us may differ in our sentiments respecting its fitness in the\r\nrelative situation of the two armies, it is our unanimous declaration\r\nthat unquestionable zeal and firmness appear to have been exhibited\r\nthroughout both by Sir Hew Dalrymple, Sir Harry Burrard, and Sir Arthur\r\nWellesley.’ There was a special compliment inserted for Wellesley’s\r\nbenefit, to the effect that his whole action, from the landing in\r\nMondego Bay down to the battle of Vimiero, was ‘highly honourable and\r\nsuccessful, and such as might have been expected from a distinguished\r\nofficer.’\r\n\r\nSuch a report amounted to a plain acquittal of all the three\r\ngenerals, but it left so much unsaid that the Government directed\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief to require from the members of the court\r\ntheir decision as to whether the armistice of the twenty-second and\r\nthe Convention of the thirtieth were advisable, and, if they were\r\nadvisable, whether their terms were proper, and honourable. On the\r\ntwenty-seventh the court returned its answer: there was, this time, no\r\nunanimous report, but a series of written opinions, for the members of\r\nthe body differed from each other on many points. As to the armistice,\r\nsix members replied that they approved of it, one, but he the most\r\ndistinguished of the seven--Lord Moira--said that he did not. On the\r\nquestion as to the definitive Convention there was more difference\r\nof opinion: Dundas, Lord Heathfield, Craig, and Nugent thought it\r\nfair and reasonable; Lord Moira, the Earl of Pembroke, and Nicholls\r\nconsidered it as unjustifiable, considering the relative situations of\r\nthe two armies. The two last-named officers added short explanatory\r\nnotes to their opinions, while Lord Moira subjoined to his a long and\r\nelaborate argument, a document which does not seem in the least to\r\ndeserve the slighting reference made to it by Napier[287]. It is very\r\nsensible in its general drift. Lord Moira contended that while on\r\nAugust 22 there was no reason why an armistice should not have been\r\nconcluded, yet the paper drawn up by Kellermann contained clauses\r\nthat limited unduly the demands which the British commander might\r\nmake in the subsequent Convention. Dalrymple ought, before conceding\r\nthem, to have reflected that Junot’s anxious and hurried offer of\r\nterms betokened demoralization. If the French had been pressed, and a\r\nconfident and haughty answer returned to their envoy, Junot would have\r\naccepted any conditions that might be imposed upon him. His army was\r\nin such a state of disorder and dismay that it was most unlikely that\r\nhe would have tried either to burn Lisbon or to retreat across the\r\nAlemtejo. Moreover, the contention that the deliverance of Portugal\r\nwas the one object of the expedition, and that it was duly secured by\r\nthe Convention, was a mistake. Lord Moira wished to point out that\r\nour armies were sent forth, not only to emancipate Portugal, but also\r\nto destroy the forces and lower the prestige of France by every means\r\nin their power. By forcing Junot to a capitulation, or by making the\r\nterms of the Convention more stringent, a much greater blow might\r\nhave been dealt to Bonaparte’s reputation. As an instance of what\r\nmight have been done, he suggested that some remote and inconvenient\r\nlanding-place--Belle Isle for example--might have been imposed upon the\r\nFrench troops, or they might have been compelled to engage not to serve\r\nfor some specified time against England and her allies.\r\n\r\n  [287] He calls it ‘a laboured criticism, which nevertheless left\r\n  the pith of the question entirely untouched’ (Napier, i. 249). I\r\n  have printed Lord Moira’s plea in an Appendix, to show that it is\r\n  well-reasoned and practical.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Inquiry had thus delivered its last opinion. But the\r\nmatter of the Convention was not even yet at an end. The ministry\r\nresolved to inflict a rebuke on Dalrymple, not for his military action,\r\non which they completely accepted the verdict of the seven generals,\r\nbut for his political action in allowing the Articles XV, XVI, and XVII\r\nto be inserted in the Convention. These, it will be remembered, were\r\nthe clauses which conceded certain privileges to the French inhabitants\r\nof Lisbon, and to the Portuguese who had compromised themselves by\r\ntaking service under Junot. The Duke of York, as commander-in-chief,\r\nwas ordered to convey to Dalrymple ‘His Majesty’s disapprobation\r\nof those articles in the Convention in which stipulations were made\r\naffecting the interests and feelings of the Spanish and Portuguese\r\nnations[288].’ It was to be impressed upon Sir Hew that it was most\r\nimproper and dangerous to admit into a military convention articles of\r\nsuch a description, which (especially when carelessly and incautiously\r\nframed) might lead to the most injurious consequences. Furthermore,\r\nDalrymple was to be gravely censured for his extraordinary delay in not\r\nsending the news of the armistice of the twenty-second till September\r\n3, whereby ‘great public inconvenience’ had been caused.\r\n\r\n  [288] _The King’s Opinion on the Convention of Cintra_,\r\n  paragraphs 4, 5, and 6.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that these rebukes were well deserved: we have\r\nalready pointed out that the three articles to which allusion is\r\nmade were the only part of the Convention for which no defence is\r\npossible. It is equally clear that it was the thirteen days’ gap in the\r\ninformation sent home which gave time for the rise and development of\r\nthe unreasoning popular agitation against the whole agreement made with\r\nJunot.\r\n\r\nAs to the verdict of the court, it does substantial justice to the\r\ncase. There existed ‘fair military reasons’ for all that Burrard and\r\nDalrymple had done, or left undone. In a similar way ‘fair military\r\nreasons’ can be alleged for most of the main slips and errors committed\r\nduring any campaign in the Napoleonic War--for Dupont’s stay at\r\nAndujar, or for Murray’s retreat from Tarragona, or for Grouchy’s\r\noperations on June 17 and 18, 1815. It would be unjust to punish old\r\nand respectable generals for mere errors of judgement, and inability\r\nto rise to the height of the situation. Burrard and Dalrymple had\r\nsacrificed the most brilliant possibilities by their torpid caution,\r\nafter refusing to listen to Wellesley’s cogent arguments for bold\r\naction. But their conduct had resulted neither from cowardice nor\r\nfrom deliberate perversity. The blame must rest quite as much on\r\nthe government, which had entrusted the expedition to elderly men\r\nunaccustomed to command in the field, as on those men themselves. And\r\nas to the details of the armistice and Convention, we may well accept\r\nWellesley’s verdict, that the gain secured by the rescue of Lisbon with\r\nall its wealth intact, and by the prompt termination of the campaign,\r\nfully justified the resolve not to drive Junot to extremity.\r\n\r\nBut there was an unexpressed corollary to the verdict of the court\r\nwhich the ministry fully realized, and upon which they acted. Burrard\r\nand Dalrymple, with their ‘fair military reasons,’ must never again\r\nappear in the field. It was not by such men that Bonaparte would be\r\nfoiled and Spain emancipated, and so they were relegated to home\r\nservice and quiet retirement for the rest of their lives. Wellesley,\r\non the other hand, was marked out as a man of energy, resource, and\r\ndetermination, eminently fit to be employed again. Within four months\r\nof the termination of the proceedings of the Court of Inquiry he was\r\nonce more in command of the British army in the Peninsula[289].\r\n\r\n  [289] The proceedings terminated Dec. 27, 1808. Wellesley took up\r\n  the command at Lisbon on April 25, 1809.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE IN CATALONIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nDUHESME’S OPERATIONS: FIRST SIEGE OF GERONA (JUNE-JULY, 1808)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is still one corner of the Iberian Peninsula whose history,\r\nduring the eventful summer months of 1808, we have not yet chronicled.\r\nThe rugged and warlike province of Catalonia had already begun that\r\nheroic struggle against its French garrison which was to endure\r\nthroughout the whole of the war. Far more than any other section of\r\nthe Spanish nation do the Catalans deserve credit for their unswerving\r\npatriotism. Nowhere else was the war maintained with such resolution.\r\nWhen the struggle commenced the French were already masters by\r\ntreachery of the chief fortresses of the land: the force of Spanish\r\nregular troops which lay within its borders was insignificant: there\r\nwas no recognized leader, no general of repute, to head the rising\r\nof the province. Yet the attack on the invaders was delivered with a\r\nfierceness and a persistent energy that was paralleled in no other\r\nquarter of the Peninsula. For six years marshal after marshal ravaged\r\nthe Catalan valleys, sacked the towns, scattered the provincial levies.\r\nBut not for one moment did the resistance slacken; the invaders\r\ncould never control a foot of ground beyond the narrow space that\r\nwas swept by the cannon of their strongholds. The spirit of the race\r\nwas as unbroken in 1813 as in 1808, and their untiring bands still\r\nheld out in the hills, ready to strike at the enemy when the least\r\nchance was offered. Other provinces had equal or greater advantages\r\nthan Catalonia for protracted resistance: Biscay, the Asturias, and\r\nGalicia were as rugged, Andalusia far more populous, Valencia more\r\nfertile and wealthy. But in none of these was the struggle carried on\r\nwith such a combination of energy and persistence as in the Catalan\r\nhills. Perhaps the greatest testimony that can be quoted in behalf\r\nof the people of that devoted province is that Napier, bitter critic\r\nas he was of all things Spanish, is forced to say a good word for\r\nit. ‘The Catalans,’ he writes, ‘were vain and superstitious; but\r\ntheir courage was higher, their patriotism purer, and their efforts\r\nmore sustained than those of the rest. The _somatenes_ were bold and\r\nactive in battle, the population of the towns firm, and the juntas\r\napparently disinterested[290].’ No one but a careful student of Napier\r\nwill realize what a handsome testimonial is contained in the somewhat\r\ngrudging language of this paragraph. What the real credit due to the\r\nCatalans was, it will now be our duty to display.\r\n\r\n  [290] Napier, _History of the Peninsular War_, i. 90.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in the month of February the French general\r\nDuhesme had obtained possession of the citadel and forts of Barcelona\r\nby a particularly impudent and shameless stratagem[291]. Since that\r\ntime he had been lying in the city that he had seized, with his whole\r\nforce concentrated under his hand. Of the 7,000 French and 5,000\r\nItalian troops which composed his corps, all were with him save a\r\nsingle battalion of detachments which had been left behind to garrison\r\nFigueras, the fortress close to the French frontier, which commands\r\nthe most important of the three roads by which the principality of\r\nCatalonia can be entered.\r\n\r\n  [291] See pp. 36, 37 of this book.\r\n\r\nDuhesme believed himself to be entirely secure, for of Spanish\r\nregular troops there were barely 6,000 in all scattered through the\r\nprovince[292], and a third of these were Swiss mercenaries, who,\r\naccording to the orders of Bonaparte, were to be taken at once into\r\nthe French service. That there was any serious danger to be feared\r\nfrom the _miqueletes_ of the mountains never entered into the heads\r\nof the Emperor or his lieutenant. Nor does it seem to have occurred\r\nto them that any insurrection which broke out in Catalonia might be\r\nimmediately supported from the Balearic Isles, where a heavy garrison\r\nwas always kept, in order to guard against any descent of the British\r\nto recover their old stronghold of Port Mahon[293]. If Napoleon had\r\nrealized in May that the Spanish rising was about to sweep over the\r\nwhole Peninsula, he would not have dared to leave Duhesme with such a\r\nsmall force. But persisting in his original blunder of believing that\r\nthe troubles which had broken out were merely local and sporadic, he\r\nwas about to order Duhesme to make large detachments from a corps that\r\nwas already dangerously weak.\r\n\r\n  [292] They were the following:--\r\n\r\n  Regiment of Estremadura                         840 strong at Tarrega\r\n                                                            (near Lerida).\r\n  Regiment of Ultonia                             421    ”      Gerona.\r\n  Two battalions of Wimpfen’s Swiss Regiment    2,149    ”      Tarragona.\r\n  Two battalions of Spanish and Walloon Guards  1,700    ”      Barcelona.\r\n  Cavalry Regiment of Borbon                      658    ”          ”\r\n  Artillery                                       300    ”   in various\r\n                                                               forts on\r\n                                                               coast.\r\n                                               ------\r\n                                                6,068\r\n\r\n\r\n  [293] The Spanish garrisons in the Balearic Isles consisted of\r\n  the following troops:--\r\n\r\n  Regiment of Granada (three batts.)       1,183 at Port Mahon.\r\n  Regiment of Soria (three batts.)         1,381      ”\r\n  Regiment of Borbon (three batts.)        1,570 at Palma.\r\n  Swiss Regiment of Beschard (two batts.)  2,121     ”\r\n  Light Infantry of Barcelona, No. 2       1,341 at Port Mahon.\r\n    ”     ”         Aragon, No. 2.         1,267 at Palma.\r\n  Militia Battalion of Majorca               604    ”\r\n  6th Hussars (_Husares Españoles_)          680    ”\r\n  Artillery                                  500    ”      and Port Mahon.\r\n                                          ------\r\n                                          10,647\r\n\r\nThe geography of Catalonia, as we have had occasion to relate in an\r\nearlier chapter, is rather complicated. Not only is the principality\r\ncut off by its mountains from the rest of Spain--it faces towards the\r\nsea, while its neighbour Aragon faces towards the Ebro--but it is\r\ndivided by its numerous cross-ranges into a number of isolated valleys,\r\nbetween which communication is very difficult. Its coast-plain along\r\nthe Mediterranean is generally narrow, and often cut across by spurs\r\nwhich run down from the mountains of the inland till they strike the\r\nsea. Except on the eastern side of the principality, where it touches\r\nAragon in the direction of Lerida, there is no broad expanse of level\r\nground within its borders: much the greater part of its surface is\r\nupland and mountain.\r\n\r\nCatalonia may be divided into four regions: the first is the district\r\nat the foot of the Eastern Pyrenees, drained by the Fluvia and the\r\nTer. This narrow corner is called the Ampurdam; it contains all the\r\nfrontier-fortresses which protect the province on the side of France.\r\nRosas commands the pass along the sea-shore, Figueras the main road\r\nfrom Perpignan, which runs some twenty miles further inland. A little\r\nfurther south both these roads meet, and are blocked by the strong\r\ncity of Gerona, the capital of all this region and its most important\r\nstrategical point. South of Gerona a cross-range divides the Ampurdam\r\nfrom the coast-plain of Central Catalonia; the defile through this\r\nrange is covered by the small fortified town of Hostalrich, but there\r\nis an alternative route from Gerona to Barcelona along the coast by\r\nBlanes and Arens de Mar.\r\n\r\nThe river-basin of Central Catalonia is that of the Llobregat, near\r\nwhose estuary Barcelona stands. Its lower course lies through the\r\nlevel ground along the coast, but its upper waters and those of its\r\ntributaries drain a series of highland valleys, difficult of access\r\nand divided from each other by considerable chains of hills. All these\r\nvalleys unite at the foot of the crag of Montserrat, which, crowned\r\nby its monastery, overlooks the plain, and stands sentinel over the\r\napproach to the upland. In the mountains behind Montserrat was the\r\nmain stronghold of the Catalan insurrection, whose rallying-places\r\nwere the high-lying towns of Manresa, Cardona, Berga, and Solsona.\r\nOnly three practicable roads enter the valleys of the Upper Llobregat,\r\none communicates by the line of Manresa and Vich with the Ampurdam;\r\na second goes from Manresa via Cervera to Lerida, and ultimately to\r\nthe plains of Aragon; the third is the high-road from Barcelona to\r\nManresa, the main line of approach from the shore to the upland. But\r\nthere is another route of high importance in this section of Catalonia,\r\nthat which, starting from Barcelona, avoids the upper valleys, strikes\r\ninland by Igualada, crosses the main watershed between the coast and\r\nthe Ebro valley below Cervera, and at that place joins the other road\r\nfrom Manresa and the Upper Llobregat, and continues on its way to\r\nLerida and the plains of Aragon. This, passing the mountains at the\r\npoint of least resistance, forms the great trunk-road from Barcelona to\r\nMadrid.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Catalonia.]\r\n\r\nThe third region of the principality is the coastland of Tarragona,\r\na district cut off from the coastland of Barcelona by a well-marked\r\ncross-ridge, which runs down from the mountains to the sea, and reaches\r\nthe latter near the mouth of the Llobregat. The communication between\r\nthe two maritime districts is by two roads, one passing the cross-ridge\r\nby the defile of Ordal, the other hugging the beach and finding its way\r\nbetween the hills and the water’s edge by Villanueva de Sitjas. The\r\ncoastland of Tarragona is not drained by a single river of considerable\r\nvolume, like the Llobregat, but by a number of small streams such as\r\nthe Francoli and the Gaya, running parallel to each other and at right\r\nangles to the coast. Each is separated from the next by a line of hills\r\nof moderate height. The southern limit of this region is the Ebro,\r\nwhose lower course is protected by the strong fortress of Tortosa.\r\nIts main line of internal communication is the great coast-route from\r\nBarcelona to Tarragona, and from Tarragona to the mouth of the Ebro.\r\nIts touch with Aragon and Central Spain is maintained by a good road\r\nfrom Tarragona by Montblanch to Lerida.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and last region of Catalonia is the inland, which looks not\r\ntowards the Mediterranean but to the Ebro and Aragon. It is drained\r\nby the Segre, an important stream, which after being joined by its\r\ntributaries, the Noguera and the Pallaresa, falls into the Ebro not\r\nfar to the south of Lerida. The tracts around that town are flat and\r\nfertile, part of the main valley of the Ebro. But the head-waters of\r\nthe Segre and its affluents flow through narrow and difficult mountain\r\nvalleys, starting in the highest and wildest region of the Pyrenees.\r\nThey are very inaccessible, and served by no roads suitable for the use\r\nof an army. Hence, like the upper valley of the Llobregat, they served\r\nas places of refuge for the Catalan insurgents when Lerida and the flat\r\ncountry had been lost. The only place of importance in these highlands\r\nis the remote town of Seu d’ Urgel[294], a mediaeval fortress near the\r\nsources of the Segre, approached by mule-paths only, and quite lost in\r\nthe hills.\r\n\r\n  [294] Urgel is more accessible from France than from Spain. The\r\n  easiest path to it is that which, starting from Mont-Louis,\r\n  crosses the Spanish frontier at Puycerda, and follows the\r\n  head-water of the Segre to the foot of the hill on which the Seu\r\n  stands.\r\n\r\nCatalonia, then, is pre-eminently a mountain land, and one presenting\r\nspecial difficulties to an invader, because it has no central system\r\nof roads or valleys, but is divided into so many heterogeneous parts.\r\nThough not fertile, it was yet rich, and fairly well peopled when\r\ncompared with other regions of Spain[295]. Its wealth came not from\r\nagriculture but from commerce and manufactures. Barcelona, a city of\r\n180,000 souls, was the greatest Mediterranean port of Spain: on each\r\nside of it, along the coast, are dozens of large fishing-villages and\r\nsmall harbour-towns, drawing their living from the sea. Of the places\r\nwhich lay farther back from the water there were many which made an\r\nample profit from their manufactures, for Catalonia was, and still\r\nremains, the workshop of Spain. It is the only province of the kingdom\r\nwhere the inhabitants have developed industries on a large scale: its\r\ntextile products were especially successful, and supplied the whole\r\nPeninsula.\r\n\r\n  [295] The population of the Principality in 1803 was 858,000\r\n  souls.\r\n\r\nMore than any other part of Spain, Catalonia had suffered from the\r\nwar with England and the Continental System. The closure of its ports\r\nhad told cruelly upon its merchants and manufacturers, who were\r\nfully aware that their sufferings were the logical consequence of\r\nthe French alliance. They had, moreover, a historic grudge against\r\nFrance: after encouraging them to revolt in the seventeenth century,\r\nthe Bourbons had then abandoned them to the mercies of the King of the\r\nCastilians. In the great war of the Spanish Succession, Catalonia had\r\ntaken sides against France and Don Philip, and had proclaimed Charles\r\nof Austria its king--not because it loved him, but because it hated\r\nthe French claimant. Even after the Peace of Utrecht the Catalans\r\nhad refused to lay down their arms, and had made a last desperate\r\nstruggle for provincial independence. It was in these wars that their\r\n_miqueletes_[296] had first made their name famous by their stubborn\r\nfighting. These bands were a levy _en masse_ of the population of\r\nmilitary age, armed and paid by their parishes, not by the central\r\ngovernment, which could be called out whenever the principality was\r\nthreatened with invasion. From their liability to turn out whenever the\r\nalarm-bell (_somaten_) was rung, they were also known as _somatenes_.\r\nThe system of the _Quinta_ and the militia ballot, which prevailed in\r\nthe provinces under the crown of Castile, had never been applied to\r\nthe Catalans, who gloried in the survival of their ancient military\r\ncustoms. The _somatenes_ had been called out in the French war of\r\n1793-5, and had done good service in it, distinguishing themselves\r\nfar more than the troops of the line which fought on the frontier\r\nof the Eastern Pyrenees. The memories of that struggle were still\r\nfresh among them, and many of the leaders who had won a name in it\r\nwere still fit for service. In Catalonia then, more than in any other\r\ncorner of Spain, there were all the materials at hand for a vigorous\r\npopular insurrection, even though the body of regular troops in the\r\nprincipality was insignificant. The Catalans rose to defend their\r\nprovincial independence, and to recover their capital, which had been\r\nseized so shamelessly by the trickery of Duhesme. They did not concern\r\nthemselves much with what was going on in Aragon and Valencia, or even\r\nin Madrid. Their fight with the invader forms an episode complete\r\nin itself, a sort of underplot in the great drama of the Peninsular\r\nWar, which only touches the main struggle at infrequent intervals. It\r\nwas not affected by the campaigns of Castile, still less had it any\r\nnoticeable influence on them. It would be equally possible to write the\r\nhistory of the war in Catalonia as a separate treatise, or to compile a\r\ngeneral history of the war in which Catalonia was barely mentioned.\r\n\r\n  [296] So called from Miquelot de Prats, the Catalan _condottiere_\r\n  who served under Caesar Borgia. From him the light infantry, once\r\n  called _almogavares_, got the name of _miqueletes_.\r\n\r\nWhen the echoes of the cannon of the second of May went rolling round\r\nSpain, they stirred up Catalonia no less than the other provinces which\r\nlie at a distance from the capital. The phenomena which appeared in the\r\nSouth and the West were repeated here, in much the same sequence, and\r\nat much the same dates, as elsewhere. But the rising of the Catalans\r\nwas greatly handicapped by the fact that their populous and wealthy\r\ncapital was occupied by 12,000 French troops. Barcelona could not set\r\nthe example to the smaller places, and for some time the outburst was\r\nspasmodic and local. The chief focus of rebellion was Lerida, where an\r\ninsurrectionary Junta was formed on May 29. At Tortosa the populace\r\nrose a few days later, and murdered the military governor, Santiago\r\nde Guzman, because he had been slow and reluctant to place himself at\r\ntheir head. On June 2 Manresa, in the upper valley of the Llobregat,\r\nfollowed their example, and from it the flame of insurrection spread\r\nall over the central upland. In Barcelona itself there were secret\r\nmeetings, and suspicious gatherings in the streets, on which Duhesme\r\nhad to keep a watchful eye. But the main preoccupation of the French\r\ngeneral was that there were still several thousand Spanish troops\r\nin the town, who might easily lead the populace in an _émeute_. He\r\nhad got rid of one regiment, that of Estremadura, in May: he gave it\r\norders to march to Lerida, where the magistrates and people refused to\r\nreceive it within their walls, dreading that it might not be ready to\r\njoin in their projected rising. This was a vain fear, for the corps\r\nreadily took its part in the insurrection, and marched to join Palafox\r\nat Saragossa. But there still remained in Barcelona a battalion each\r\nof the Spanish and the Walloon Guards, and the cavalry regiment of\r\nBorbon, some 2,500 men in all. To Duhesme’s intense satisfaction,\r\nthese troops, instead of keeping together and attacking the French\r\ngarrison when the news of the revolt reached them, began to desert in\r\nsmall parties. Far from attempting to compel them to stay by their\r\ncolours, Duhesme winked at their evasion, and took no notice of their\r\nproceedings, even when a whole squadron of the Borbon Regiment rode off\r\nwith trumpets sounding and its officers at its head. Within a few days\r\nthe greater part of the Spanish troops had vanished, and when Duhesme\r\nwas directed by his master to disarm them, there were very few left\r\nfor him to deal with. These scattered remnants of the Guard Regiments\r\ndrifted in small bands all over Catalonia, some were found at Gerona,\r\nothers at Tarragona, others at Rosas. Nearly 400 went to Aragon and\r\nfought under Palafox at Epila: another considerable body joined the\r\nValencian insurgents[297]. But these two strong veteran battalions\r\nnever were united again, or made to serve as a nucleus for the Catalan\r\nlevies[298].\r\n\r\n  [297] There were 400 Spanish Guards at the fight on the\r\n  Cabrillas, who must have come from the battalion at Barcelona.\r\n\r\n  [298] I cannot make out the movements of the cavalry regiment of\r\n  Borbon; it was certainly at Barcelona, 600 strong, in May. But\r\n  in July it had got down to Andalusia, and was marching with a\r\n  strength of 401 in the army of Castaños.\r\n\r\nSaved from the peril of a rising of the Spanish regiments in Barcelona,\r\nDuhesme had still the insurrection of the province on his hands. But he\r\nwas not left free to deal with it according to his own inspirations.\r\nBy the last dispatch from Napoleon which reached him before the\r\ncommunications with Madrid and Bayonne were cut, a plan of campaign was\r\ndictated to him. The Emperor ordered him to chastise the insurgents of\r\nLerida and Manresa, without ceasing to keep a strong grip on Barcelona,\r\nand on the line of touch with France through Figueras. But, as if this\r\nwas not enough to occupy his small army of 12,000 or 13,000 men, he\r\nwas to provide two strong detachments, one of which was to co-operate\r\nwith Moncey in Valencia, and the other with Lefebvre-Desnouettes in\r\nAragon. A glance at the Emperor’s instructions is enough to show how\r\nentirely he had misconceived the situation, and how thoroughly he had\r\nfailed to realize that all Spain was up in arms. The first detachment,\r\n4,000 strong, was to march on Lerida, and to enter Aragon along the\r\nline of the Ebro. It was then to move on Saragossa to join Lefebvre.\r\nThe second detachment, also 4,000 strong, was to move on Valencia\r\nvia Tortosa, join Marshal Moncey, and finally occupy the great naval\r\narsenal of Cartagena. With the 5,000 men that remained Duhesme was to\r\nhold down Barcelona and Central Catalonia, while keeping open the line\r\nof communications with Figueras and Perpignan.\r\n\r\nEither Duhesme was as blind to the real state of affairs as his\r\nmaster, or he considered that unquestioning obedience was his first\r\nduty. He told off the two columns as directed, only cutting down\r\ntheir strength a little, so as not wholly to ungarnish Barcelona. For\r\nthe Valencian expedition he told off General Chabran, with the best\r\nbrigade in his army, three veteran French battalions of the 7th and\r\n16th of the line[299]. With this force he sent his single brigade of\r\nFrench cavalry, two regiments under General Bessières (the brother of\r\nthe Duke of Istria). The whole amounted to 2,500 foot and 600 horse.\r\nFor the attack on Lerida, he had to send out troops of more doubtful\r\nvalue--all foreigners, for there were no more French to be spared.\r\nGeneral Schwartz was given one Swiss, two Neapolitan, and one Italian\r\nbattalion[300], with no more than a single squadron of cavalry, for\r\nhis march was to lie over a very mountainous country. His whole force\r\nwas 3,200 strong. To the general directions given by Napoleon, Duhesme\r\nadded some supplementary orders of his own. Chabran was to pass by\r\nTarragona, leave a battalion in its citadel, and take as a compensation\r\nthe two battalions of Wimpfen’s Swiss Regiment, which was to be\r\nincorporated in the French army. It was expected that he would get into\r\ntouch with Marshal Moncey when he should reach Castellon de la Plana.\r\nSchwartz, on the other hand, was told to march by the mountain road\r\nleading to Manresa, in order to punish the inhabitants of that town for\r\ntheir rebellion. He was to fine them 750,000 francs, and to destroy a\r\npowder-mill which they possessed. He was then to march on Lerida, from\r\nwhich he was to evict the insurrectionary Junta: the city was to pay\r\na heavy war-contribution, and to receive a garrison of 500 men. With\r\nthe rest of his brigade Schwartz was to join the French forces before\r\nSaragossa, not later than June 19.\r\n\r\n  [299] This force was Goulas’s Brigade of Chabran’s Division,\r\n  viz.:--\r\n\r\n    7th of the Line (1st and 2nd batts.)        1,785\r\n    16th    ”       (3rd batt.)                   789\r\n                                                -----  2,574\r\n\r\n  and Bessières’ Cavalry:\r\n    3rd Provisional Cuirassiers (minus one\r\n        squadron)                                 205\r\n    3rd Provisional Chasseurs                     416\r\n                                                 ----    621\r\n                                                       -----  3,195\r\n    with eight guns.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [300] Schwartz’s force was:--\r\n\r\n  2nd Swiss (3rd batt.)                           580\r\n  1st Neapolitans (1st and 2nd batts.)          1,944\r\n  1st Italian _Velites_ (1st batt.)               519\r\n                                                -----  3,043\r\n  One squadron of the 3rd Provisional Cuirassiers        204\r\n                                                       -----  3,247\r\n  with four guns.\r\n\r\n  [That the detached squadron were cuirassiers is proved by\r\n  Arteche, ii. 86. The French authorities do not give the regiment.]\r\n\r\n  Foy makes the odd mistake of saying ‘trois bataillons du\r\n  deuxième Suisse,’ instead of ‘le troisième bataillon du\r\n  deuxième Suisse.’ There was only one battalion of this regiment\r\n  with Duhesme.\r\n\r\nSchwartz started from Barcelona on June 4: a tempest forced him to wait\r\nfor a day at Martorel, in the coast-plain, but on the sixth he reached\r\nthe pass of Bruch, at whose foot the roads from Igualada and from\r\nManresa join. Here he met with opposition: the news of his approach\r\nhad spread all up the valley of the Llobregat, and the _somatenes_ of\r\nthe upland towns were hurrying forward to hold the defile by which the\r\nhigh-road from Barcelona climbs into the upper country. At the moment\r\nwhen the invaders, marching in the most careless fashion, were making\r\ntheir way up the hill, only the levy of Manresa was in position. They\r\nwere a mere handful, 300 or 400 at most, and many were destitute of\r\nmuskets. But from the cover of a pine-wood they boldly opened fire upon\r\nthe head of Schwartz’s column. Surprised to find himself attacked,\r\nthe French general deployed a battalion and drove the _somatenes_ out\r\nof their position: they retired in great disorder up the hill towards\r\nManresa. Schwartz followed them with caution, under the idea that they\r\nmust be the vanguard of a larger force, and that there were probably\r\nregular troops in support, further along the defile. In this he was\r\nwrong, but the retreating Manresans received reinforcements a few\r\nmiles behind the place of the first skirmish. They were joined by the\r\nlevies of San Pedor and other villages of the Upper Llobregat, marching\r\nforward to the sound of the single drum that was to be found in the\r\nupland. The peasants ensconced themselves in the rocks and bushes on\r\neither side of the road, and again offered battle. Schwartz took their\r\nopposition much too seriously, extended a long front of tirailleurs\r\nagainst them, but did not push his attack home. Soon other bands of\r\n_somatenes_ from the direction of Igualada began to gather round his\r\nleft flank, and it seemed to him that he would soon be surrounded and\r\ncut off from his line of communications with Barcelona. His regiments\r\nwere raw and not of the best quality: the Neapolitans who composed more\r\nthan half his force passed, and with reason, as the worst troops in\r\nEurope. He himself was a cavalry officer who had never held independent\r\ncommand before, and was wholly unversed in mountain warfare. Reflecting\r\nthat the afternoon was far spent, that he was still twelve miles from\r\nManresa, and that the whole country-side was on the move against him,\r\nhe resolved to abandon his expedition. Instead of hurling his four\r\nbattalions upon the _somatenes_, who must have been scattered to the\r\nwinds if attacked by such superior numbers, he drew back, formed his\r\nmen in a great square, with the cavalry and guns in the middle, and\r\nbegan a retreat across the more open parts of the defile. The Spaniards\r\nfollowed, pressing in the screen of tirailleurs by which the square\r\nwas covered, and taking easy shots into the solid mass behind them.\r\nAfter six miles of marching under fire, Schwartz’s Swiss and Italians\r\nwere growing somewhat demoralized, for nothing could be more harassing\r\nto raw and unwilling troops than such a retreat. At last they found\r\ntheir way blocked by the village of Esparraguera, where the inhabitants\r\nbarricaded the streets and opened a hot fire upon the front face of\r\nthe square. Seeing his men hesitate and break their ranks, Schwartz\r\nhastily bade them scatter right and left and pass round the village\r\nwithout attempting to storm it. This device succeeded, but when the two\r\nhalves of the column reunited beyond Esparraguera, they were in such\r\ndisorder that there was no means of stopping them. The whole streamed\r\ninto Martorel in a confused mass at nightfall, after a retreat whose\r\nincidents remind the military reader, in every detail, of the rout of\r\nthe British troops in the march to Lexington, on the first day of the\r\nold American War of 1775.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the plains Schwartz was able to retire unharmed to\r\nBarcelona, having saved three of his four guns[301] and lost no very\r\nlarge proportion of his men. But he had suffered the disgrace of being\r\nworsted by inferior numbers of undisciplined peasantry, and brought his\r\ntroops back in a state of demoralization, which was very discouraging\r\nto the rest of the garrison of the Catalonian capital. Duhesme, instead\r\nof taking him to task, fully approved of his retreat, on the ground\r\nthat if he had pushed on for Manresa and Lerida he would probably have\r\nlost his whole brigade. Realizing at last the true strength of the\r\ninsurrection, and learning that the _somaten_ was sounding in every\r\nvillage, and that the peasantry were flocking together in thousands,\r\nDuhesme determined to concentrate his whole force, and sent orders\r\nto Chabran to abandon his Valencian expedition and return at once to\r\nBarcelona. He was probably quite right in his resolve, though Chabran’s\r\nretreat was the determining fact that ruined Moncey’s campaign in the\r\nprovince south of the Ebro. The Emperor had sketched out the whole plan\r\nof operations on false premises, and when the new military situation\r\nhad developed itself, it would have been absurd for his lieutenants to\r\ncarry out his original orders in blind and servile obedience.\r\n\r\n  [301] One gun was lost after leaving Esparraguera by the fall of\r\n  a rickety bridge over the Abrera (Arteche, ii. 93, 94). Foy and\r\n  other French narrators do not mention this loss.\r\n\r\nChabran’s column had reached Tarragona when it received Duhesme’s\r\nletters of recall. It had started on June 4, and found the coastland\r\nstill quiet, the insurrection not having yet spread downwards from the\r\nhills. On arriving at Tarragona Chabran took possession of the citadel,\r\nand issued orders to the two battalions of Wimpfen’s Swiss Regiment,\r\nwhich formed the garrison of the place, to prepare to march with him\r\nagainst Valencia. The Swiss officers showed no alacrity in falling in\r\nwith this plan. They were not animated by the patriotic fury which had\r\ncarried away the rest of the Spanish regular troops into the insurgent\r\ncamp. On the other hand they felt no enthusiasm at the idea of joining\r\nthe French in an attack on their late employers. They were deferring\r\nobedience to the orders of the French general on various futile pleas,\r\nwhen the news of Schwartz’s defeat at Bruch reached Tarragona. Directed\r\nto return in haste and to rejoin Duhesme, General Chabran marched off\r\non June 9, leaving Wimpfen’s mercenaries behind: they would not follow\r\nhim, and declared in favour of the insurgent Junta at Lerida the moment\r\nthat his back was turned. The retreating French column had to brush\r\naside several considerable bands of _somatenes_, which tried to arrest\r\nits progress, for the coastland had taken arms after the combat of\r\nBruch, and its levies hoped to treat Chabran as their compatriots\r\nof the upland had treated Schwartz. But the three veteran French\r\nbattalions were of tougher material than the Neapolitans and Italians\r\nwho had been routed on the sixth, and successfully cut their way back\r\nto Barcelona. They were aided by the unwisdom of the insurgents, who,\r\ninstead of trying to defend the difficult defile of Ordal, came down\r\ninto the plain. When they attacked Chabran at Vendrell and Arbos, they\r\nwere charged by his cavalry and scattered to the winds with heavy loss.\r\nThe French, when the actions were over, sacked with every circumstance\r\nof brutality all the villages which lay along their path[302]. On June\r\n11 they got into touch with Duhesme’s outposts, and on the twelfth\r\nre-entered Barcelona.\r\n\r\n  [302] For details see Arteche, ii. 98, 99, and Foy, iv. 150, who\r\n  adds that Arbos ‘fut pillé et réduit en cendres, _conformément\r\n  aux usages de la guerre_’(!)\r\n\r\nThe whole of the ‘Army of the Eastern Pyrenees’ was now reunited\r\nunder its commander’s hand, and Duhesme thought himself strong enough\r\nto punish the peasantry of the Upper Llobregat for their victory at\r\nBruch. On the fourteenth Chabran, with his own brigade and the Swiss\r\nand Italians of Schwartz, marched from Martorel to assault once more\r\nthe pass which the uplanders had defended so well eight days before.\r\nBut the woods and rocks of Bruch were now manned by many thousands of\r\n_somatenes_: all Central Catalonia had sent its levies thither, and\r\nthey were supported by 400 regulars from Lerida and four pieces of\r\nartillery. After feeling the position, and directing against it at\r\nleast one serious attack, Chabran drew back and refused to press on the\r\naction--apparently influenced by the manifest reluctance of Schwartz’s\r\ntroops to advance, no less than by the strength of the ground. After\r\nlosing nearly 400 men he retired to the plain and marched back to\r\nBarcelona [June 15].\r\n\r\nDuhesme had a more pressing business in hand than the chastisement of\r\nthe mountaineers of the Upper Llobregat. He had now learnt, by the fact\r\nthat couriers from France had ceased to arrive, that his communications\r\nwith Figueras and Upper Catalonia had been cut, and it was absolutely\r\nnecessary that they should be reopened. This was to prove a harder task\r\nthan he imagined: the _somatenes_ were now up in every valley as far\r\nas the French frontier; they had driven into the citadel of Figueras\r\nthe weak battalion of detachments that had been left to hold that\r\ntown, and some of the bolder spirits were feeling their way through\r\nthe Pyrenean recesses to commence raids on Roussillon. Such alarm was\r\nfelt at Perpignan that the general commanding the district had begun to\r\ncall out the national guards, for he had no regulars at his disposal\r\nsave a few hundred men of details and detachments, who were waiting to\r\ngo forward to join their regiments in Duhesme’s corps. But all this\r\nwas unknown at Barcelona, and it was with very little conception of\r\nthe difficulties before him that Duhesme resolved to march on Gerona\r\nand reopen the main road to France. He told off for this service one\r\nhalf of the infantry battalions which composed his army--the Italian\r\ndivision of Lecchi, consisting of the brigades of Schwartz and of\r\nMilosewitz, the latter of which had hitherto remained in garrison at\r\nBarcelona, and had not taken part in the futile attacks on the defile\r\nof Bruch. He also took with him nearly the whole of his cavalry, four\r\nFrench and three Italian squadrons of cuirassiers and chasseurs, and\r\na battery of eight guns. This gave him a formidable force of 5,900\r\nmen[303], about half of the total strength of his corps when the losses\r\nsuffered at Bruch and elsewhere are deducted.\r\n\r\n  [303] Brigade of Milosewitz:\r\n      2nd Italian Line (2nd batt.)             740\r\n      4th ” (3rd batt.)                        587\r\n      5th ” (2nd batt.)                        806\r\n                                              ----  2,133\r\n\r\n  Brigade of Schwartz:\r\n      1st Neapolitans (1st and 2nd batts.)   1,944\r\n      1st Italian _Velites_ (1st batt.)        519\r\n        (Minus 300 men lost in the actions at\r\n           Bruch on June 6 and 14)\r\n                                             -----  2,163\r\n\r\n  Cavalry:\r\n    3rd Provisional Cuirassiers                409\r\n    3rd ” Chasseurs                            416\r\n    Italian _Chasseurs à Cheval_               504\r\n    2nd Neapolitan      ”                      388\r\n      (Minus one squadron left at\r\n         Barcelona, say                        200)\r\n                                             -----  1,517\r\n\r\n  Artillerymen for eight guns                         150\r\n                                                    -----  5,963\r\n\r\n\r\nDuhesme had resolved to march on Gerona by the comparatively easy road\r\nalong the sea-coast, rather than by the alternative route which passes\r\nfurther inland by the valley of the Besos and the town of Hostalrich.\r\nEven in the lowland, however, he found the _somatenes_ prepared to\r\noppose him. At the castle of Mongat, only six miles outside Barcelona,\r\nhe met the first swarm 8,000 or 9,000 strong. They had procured a\r\nfew guns, which they had mounted so as to sweep the road, and lay in\r\ndisorderly masses along the crest of a rising ground. Duhesme, amusing\r\nthem in front by a false attack, sent a strong column to turn their\r\nright flank: seeing themselves likely to be enveloped, the peasants\r\nfled after a short skirmish, in which they suffered considerable loss.\r\nPushing onward, Duhesme arrived that same afternoon at the large open\r\ntown of Mataro, a place of 20,000 souls given over to the manufacture\r\nof glass and cotton goods. The populace had hastily barricaded\r\nthe outlets of the streets with carts and piles of furniture, and\r\ndischarged two or three cannon against the approaching enemy. But\r\nMilosewitz’s Italian brigade easily burst through the feeble defences\r\nand took Mataro by storm. Its attempt at resistance was considered by\r\nDuhesme to justify its sack, and he granted the plunder of the town to\r\nhis men, who only moved on the next day after having thoroughly robbed\r\nevery dwelling of its portable goods and murdered a considerable number\r\nof the inhabitants. The French army of Catalonia was the most motley\r\nand undisciplined force of all the imperial hosts in Spain, and for\r\nthat reason it was by far the most cruel and brutal in its behaviour to\r\nthe natives, who had not as yet justified any such treatment by their\r\nmanner of conducting the war. Any ferocity which they showed from this\r\ntime onward was a well-deserved revenge for what they had suffered.\r\n\r\nLeaving Mataro on the eighteenth, Duhesme arrived before Gerona on the\r\ntwentieth, after burning most of the villages on the road, in revenge\r\nfor the constant molestation which he suffered from the _somatenes_.\r\nHe found the city placed in a state of defence, so far as was possible\r\nin the case of an old-fashioned fortress called upon to stand a siege\r\nat ten days’ notice. There was a small regular garrison, the Irish\r\nregiment of Ultonia, under its two lieutenant-colonels, O’Donovan and\r\nO’Daly: but this corps only counted 350 bayonets. In addition there\r\nwere a few trained artillerymen, and the armed citizens of the town,\r\nnot more than 2,000 in all, for Gerona had but 14,000 inhabitants. The\r\nplace lies on either side of the small stream of the Oña, just above\r\nits confluence with the river Ter. On the south bank is the main part\r\nof the town, straggling up the side of a steep hill, which is crowned\r\nat its eastern end by an ancient citadel, known (like those of several\r\nother Catalonian towns) by the name of Monjuich. Further westward,\r\nalong the crest of this hill, lie three other forts, those of the\r\nConstable, Queen Anne, and the Capuchins. These, like the citadel, are\r\ndetached works, not connected by any line of wall but only by a ditch.\r\nThe town, which is completely commanded by the four forts, has no\r\nprotection on the south side of the Oña but a mediaeval wall, destitute\r\nof a ditch and not more than twenty feet high. But on the other side\r\nof the river, the northern suburb, known as the Mercadal, having no\r\nline of outlying heights to protect it, had been fortified in the style\r\nof Vauban with a regular front of five bastions, though, like the\r\nfortifications of the city, it was without a ditch.\r\n\r\nDuhesme had no battering-train, and his force of 5,900 men was\r\ninsufficient to invest the whole circumference of the city of Gerona\r\nand its forts. But, like Moncey before Valencia, he was resolved to\r\nmake an attempt to storm the city by escalade, or by battering in its\r\ngates. He left alone the citadel and the line of works on the hill,\r\nonly sending a single battalion to demonstrate against the fort of the\r\nCapuchins. His real attack was directed against the sole point where\r\nthe old _enceinte_ of the city is not fully protected by the forts,\r\nthe gate of the Carmen, on the very brink of the Oña. In no very\r\nhonourable spirit, he sent in one of his aides-de-camp, with a white\r\nflag, to demand the surrender of Gerona, and while that officer was\r\nconferring with the governor and the local Junta, suddenly launched his\r\ncolumn of assault against the gate, hoping to catch the Spaniards off\r\ntheir guard. The attack was a failure: the heavy guns from the forts\r\nabove silenced the French field-artillery which tried to batter in the\r\ngate. Then Duhesme sent forward a storming party, with artillerymen\r\nat its head bearing petards with which to blow open the entrance:\r\nbut the heavy musketry-fire from the walls laid low the head of the\r\ncolumn, and the rest swerved, and fell back to get under cover. A\r\nfeeble demonstration beyond the Oña against the bastions of Santa Clara\r\nand San Francisco had not even the desired effect of distracting the\r\nattention of the defenders of the Carmen Gate.\r\n\r\nSeeing his attack foiled, Duhesme sent in at dusk a second flag of\r\ntruce, inviting the Junta of Gerona to send out deputies to confer with\r\nhim on certain points which he was desirous of submitting to them.\r\nThe Catalans were simple enough to comply with his offer: they would\r\nhave been wiser to avoid all negotiations with such an enemy. For this\r\nparley was only intended to cover a second assault. Seeing that he\r\ncould not hope to batter his way into the place by means of his light\r\nfield-artillery, Duhesme was preparing a great escalade under cover of\r\nthe night. The point which he chose for it was the bastion of Santa\r\nClara, on the centre of the low front of the Mercadal, beyond the Oña.\r\nHe collected a quantity of ladders from the neighbouring villages,\r\nand told off for the assault the three battalions of the brigade of\r\nSchwartz.\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock[304] the Italians crept up beneath the ramparts, where\r\nthe citizens on guard do not seem to have kept a good look out, and\r\ndelivered their attack. But these raw troops, moving in the darkness,\r\nmade many mistakes: the chief one was that many of the ladder-party\r\nwent astray among the water-courses and field-walls, so that the\r\nprovision of ladders proved insufficient. The garrison of the bastion,\r\nhowever, had been taken completely by surprise, and allowed the head\r\nof the column to escalade the twenty-foot wall with no more hindrance\r\nthan a few musket-shots. The Neapolitan Colonel Ambrosio and the\r\nleading files had actually mounted, and driven back the citizens to\r\nthe gorge of the bastion, when there arrived reinforcements, a company\r\nof the Regiment of Ultonia, which charged with the bayonet, drove the\r\nItalians back, and hurled them over the rampart. An Irish lieutenant,\r\nThomas Magrath, and a Carmelite friar seized and overturned the\r\nladders, at the cost of the life of the former. When the garrison began\r\nfiring down into the mass of assailants crowded at the foot of the\r\nwall, and the neighbouring bastion commenced to discharge a flanking\r\nfire of artillery, the Italians broke and fled. A second attempt at\r\nan escalade, made two hours later at another bastion, failed even\r\nmore lamentably, for the garrison were on the alert and detected the\r\nassailants before they drew near the walls.\r\n\r\n  [304] Napier says that the assault was delivered at seven in\r\n  the evening, before dark (i. 79); but all the Spanish accounts\r\n  speak of it as having taken place long after dark, though before\r\n  midnight (cf. Arteche, Toreño, and Minali, quoted by the former);\r\n  so does Foy (iv. 158), who fixes the hour as ‘between nine and\r\n  ten.’\r\n\r\nConvinced that he was too weak to take Gerona without siege-artillery,\r\nDuhesme broke up his camp and fled under cover of the night, marking\r\nhis retreat by a third insincere attempt to open negotiations with the\r\ngarrison. He hastily made off by the same road by which he had come,\r\nand returned to Barcelona by forced marches, dropping on the way one of\r\nhis Italian brigades at Mataro [June 24]. In the whole expedition he\r\nhad lost 700 men[305].\r\n\r\n  [305] Yet he had the hardihood to write to the Emperor that\r\n  ‘after some slight skirmishing, he did not think it worth while\r\n  to make a serious attack on Gerona’ (_Nap. Corresp._, xvii. 347).\r\n\r\nSo ended the first attempt on Gerona, to the great credit of its\r\ngallant defenders, and more especially to that of the weak Irish\r\nregiment which had borne the brunt of the fighting. Duhesme’s whole\r\ncampaign bore a singular resemblance to that which Moncey was making at\r\nthe same moment in Valencia, and, like it, was wrecked on the initial\r\nblunder of supposing that Spanish towns, defended by a population in\r\na high state of patriotic enthusiasm, could be carried by escalade\r\nwithout any proper preparation by artillery. French generals soon got\r\nto know their adversaries better: the same levies that could be easily\r\nscattered in the open field were formidable under cover of stone walls.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Barcelona, Duhesme found that the insurgents of Central\r\nCatalonia had drawn close to the capital in his absence. Eight or ten\r\nthousand _somatenes_ had come down to the line of the Llobregat, had\r\nbroken its bridges, had entrenched themselves opposite its fords,\r\nand were preparing to blockade Barcelona. They had brought up a\r\nconsiderable number of guns taken from the batteries on the coast,\r\nwhich had so long kept watch upon the English. But of regular troops\r\nthere were only a few present--a mixed body of 400 men from Lerida,\r\nand some small remnants of the old Spanish garrison of Barcelona. The\r\ncommand seems to have been held by Juan Baget, a lawyer of Lerida,\r\nwho had been named colonel of _miqueletes_ by the Junta of his native\r\ntown. Duhesme was determined not to be deprived of his hold on the\r\ncoast-plain by this tumultuary army. On the thirtieth he sallied out\r\nfrom Barcelona with Goulas’s French brigade and three of Lecchi’s\r\nItalian battalions, accompanied by the cuirassiers of Bessières.\r\nThough the line of the Llobregat is marked by steep banks, and though\r\na considerable number of guns were mounted behind it, the position was\r\ntoo long and too much exposed to be capable of defence by undisciplined\r\nbands of mountaineers. While the Italians menaced its front, Goulas and\r\nBessières forded the river and turned the flank of the Catalans. Chased\r\nout from the villages of San Boy and Molins de Rey by a sweeping\r\ncharge, they were pursued across the plain, stripped of all their\r\nartillery, and forced to take refuge in their old positions along the\r\nedge of the mountains of Montserrat, after losing a considerable number\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nLess successful was another stroke against the insurgents which Duhesme\r\nendeavoured to deal five days later. General Chabran, with the Italian\r\nbrigade that had been left at Mataro, a regiment of French cavalry and\r\na field-battery, moved out to clear the hills above the coast, and to\r\nsweep the valley of the Besos. He had before him the _somatenes_ of\r\nthe regions about Vich, Hostalrich, and Santa Coloma, under Francisco\r\nMilans, a half-pay lieutenant-colonel, who had been placed at their\r\nhead by the local Junta. Chabran forced his way for some distance\r\ninland till he reached Granollers, always harassed but never seriously\r\nattacked by the insurgents. Milans, who showed all through his career\r\na real genius for guerilla warfare, had ordered his levies never to\r\nstand when pressed, but to hang about the enemy’s line of march, cut\r\noff his pickets and scouting parties, and fall upon the baggage-train\r\nwhich trailed at the rear of his column. These tactics were perfectly\r\nsuccessful: having reached Granollers after a most toilsome march,\r\nChabran refused to push further among the mountains, turned back, and\r\nretreated to Mataro, accompanied home by the _somatenes_, who pursued\r\nhim to the very outskirts of the town, and cut off his stragglers and\r\nmany of his baggage animals [July 4].\r\n\r\nThe moment that the Catalan insurrection grew serious, Duhesme had sent\r\nrepeated appeals for help to the Emperor: the land route to Perpignan\r\nbeing cut, he had to use small vessels which put out to sea at night,\r\nrisked capture by the English ships lying off the coast, and when\r\nfortunate reached the harbours of Collioure or Port-Vendres, just\r\nbeyond the Pyrenees. Napoleon looked upon the Catalonian war as a very\r\nsmall matter, but he was fully resolved that Duhesme must be succoured.\r\nAccordingly he determined to concentrate a division at Perpignan, but\r\nhe refused to allot to it any of his veteran French troops. He swept\r\ntogether from the Southern Alps and Piedmont a most heterogeneous body\r\nof 7,000 or 8,000 men, even worse in quality than the motley army which\r\nhe had entrusted to Duhesme. The command was entrusted to a capable\r\nofficer, General Reille, one of the Emperor’s aides-de-camp, who was\r\ntold to advance and relieve Figueras, after which he was to stretch\r\nout his hand to Duhesme, who would push northward to meet him. His\r\nimprovised army consisted of two battalions of recruits just levied\r\nin the lately annexed duchy of Tuscany, and constituting the nucleus\r\nof a new regiment with the number 113, of a battalion of national\r\nguards, some mobilized gendarmerie, a battalion of the ‘Legion of\r\nReserve of the Alps’ from Grenoble, five ‘battalions of detachments,’\r\nand the single battalion which formed the contingent of the little\r\nrepublic of the Valais[306]. The cavalry comprised two squadrons of\r\nTuscan dragoons, and two _escadrons de marche_ of French cuirassiers\r\nand chasseurs. There seem to have been no more than two batteries of\r\nartillery allotted to the force[307]. Reille was informed that other\r\ntroops from Italy would ultimately arrive at Perpignan, but that they\r\nwere not to be expected till the end of July or the beginning of\r\nAugust. For the relief of Figueras and the opening up of communications\r\nwith Duhesme he must depend on his own forces.\r\n\r\n  [306] The Valais was a republic from 1802 till 1810, when it was\r\n  annexed to the Empire, as the ‘department of the Simplon.’\r\n\r\n  [307] From _Nap. Corresp._, 14,092, 14,150, 14,151, and 14,168,\r\n  we get the composition of this force. They account for the\r\n  following:\r\n\r\n  Two batts. of the 113th (Tuscans)                             1,300\r\n  National Guards of the Pyrénées Orientales                      560\r\n  1st Provisional Battalion of Perpignan (companies from the\r\n        dépôts of the 1st, 5th, 24th, 62nd of the Line, and 16th\r\n        and 22nd Léger)                                           840\r\n  2nd Provisional Battalion, similarly formed from the 23rd,\r\n        60th, 79th, 81st of the Line, and the 8th and 18th\r\n        Léger                                                     840\r\n  A mixed battalion of the 16th and 32nd French and 2nd Swiss   1,100\r\n  Another from the 7th and 93rd of the Line                       840\r\n  Another from the 2nd, 56th, and 37th of the Line                840\r\n  One battalion of the ‘5th Legion of Reserve’ from Grenoble      500\r\n  Battalion of the Valais                                         800\r\n  Two squadrons of Tuscan Dragoons                                250\r\n  Two _escadrons de marche_ (French)                              300\r\n  Two batteries of artillery                                      200\r\n                                                                -----\r\n                                                                8,370\r\n\r\n  There were also nine companies of gendarmerie and ‘departmental\r\n  reserves.’\r\n\r\nTravelling with commendable rapidity, Reille arrived at Perpignan on\r\nJuly 3. Of all the detachments that were marching to join him he found\r\nthat nothing had yet reached the frontier but the local national guards\r\nand gendarmerie, the two Tuscan battalions, a company of the 2nd Swiss\r\nRegiment, and artillerymen enough to serve a couple of guns. With no\r\nmore than the Tuscans and the Swiss, less than 1,600 men in all, he\r\nmarched on Figueras on July 5, dispersing on the way some bands of\r\n_somatenes_, who tried to oppose him at the passage of the Muga. He\r\nthrew a convoy into the place and strengthened its garrison, but could\r\ndo no more, for all the country beyond Figueras was up in arms, and his\r\nraw Italian recruits could hardly be kept to their colours. Indeed he\r\nwas forced to make them march in solid columns whenever he moved them,\r\nfor when ordered to deploy they always fell into disorder, and tried to\r\nmake off to the rear[308].\r\n\r\n  [308] Foy, iv. 165, 166.\r\n\r\nBut by July 11 Reille had begun to receive many of the drafts and\r\ndetachments which the Emperor was pouring into Perpignan, and having\r\nnow three or four thousand men disposable, he resolved to strike a\r\nblow at Rosas, the small seaport town which blocks the coast-road from\r\nPerpignan to Barcelona. Marching through the plains of the Ampurdam\r\nhe reached his objective, an insignificant place with a dilapidated\r\nouter entrenchment and a citadel of some small strength. It was\r\ndefended by no more than 400 _miqueletes_, and had but five guns on\r\nits land-front. But the little garrison showed a bold face, and when\r\nReille proceeded to invest Rosas he found himself attacked from the\r\nrear by four or five thousand _somatenes_ levied by Don Juan Claros, a\r\nretired infantry captain who had called to arms the peasantry of the\r\ncoast. They beset the besiegers so fiercely that Reille resolved to\r\nabandon the investment, a determination which was assisted by the sight\r\nof a British line-of-battle ship[309] landing marines to strengthen the\r\ngarrison. Accordingly he cut his way back to Figueras on the twelfth,\r\nharassed all the way by the bands of Claros, who killed or took no\r\nless than 200 of his men[310]. Rosas was to defy capture for some\r\nmonths more, for Reille’s next effort was, by his master’s direction,\r\ndevoted to a more important object--the clearing of the great road\r\nfrom Perpignan to Barcelona, and the opening up of communications with\r\nDuhesme.\r\n\r\n  [309] The _Montague_, of 74 guns, Captain R.

Otway.\r\n\r\n  [310] Foy, iv. 169.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE IN CATALONIA (JULY-AUGUST, 1808): THE SECOND SIEGE OF\r\nGERONA\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first six weeks of the war in Catalonia Duhesme and Reille had\r\nbeen opposed only by the gallant _somatenes_. Of the handful of regular\r\ntroops who had been stationed in the principality when the insurrection\r\nbroke out, the greater part had drifted off to the siege of Saragossa,\r\nor to the struggle in the south. Only the Irish regiment at Gerona,\r\nand certain fragments of the disbanded battalions of the Guards from\r\nBarcelona had aided the peasantry in resisting the invader. The success\r\nof the Catalans, in hemming in Duhesme and checking Reille’s advance,\r\nis all the more notable when we reflect that their levies had not been\r\nguided by any central organization, nor placed under the command of any\r\nsingle general. The Junta at Lerida had done little more than issue\r\nproclamations and serve out to the _somatenes_ the moderate amount\r\nof munitions of war that was at its disposition. It had indeed drawn\r\nout a scheme for the raising of a provincial army--forty _tercios_ of\r\n_miqueletes_, each 1,000 strong, were to be levied and kept permanently\r\nin the field. But this scheme existed only on paper, and there were\r\nno means of officering or arming such a mass of men. Even as late as\r\nAugust 1, there were only 6,000 of them embodied in organized corps:\r\nthe mass of the men of military age were still at their own firesides,\r\nprepared to turn out at the sound of the _somaten_, whenever a French\r\ncolumn appeared in their neighbourhood, but not ready to keep the field\r\nfor more than a few days, or to transfer their service to the more\r\ndistant regions of the principality. The direction of these irregular\r\nbands was still in the hands of local leaders like Claros, Milans, and\r\nBaget, who aided each other in a sufficiently loyal fashion when they\r\nhad the chance, but did not obey any single commander-in-chief, or act\r\non any settled military plan. Their successes had been due to their\r\nown untutored intelligence and courage, not to the carrying out of any\r\nregular policy.\r\n\r\nThis period of patriotic anarchy was now drawing to an end; regular\r\ntroops were beginning to appear on the scene in considerable numbers,\r\nand the direction of the military resources of Catalonia was about to\r\nbe confided to their generals. The change was not all for the better:\r\nduring the whole struggle the Spaniards showed themselves admirable\r\ninsurgents but indifferent soldiers. After one more short but brilliant\r\nperiod of success, the balance of fortune was about to turn against\r\nthe Catalans, and a long series of disasters was to try, but never to\r\nsubdue, their indomitable and persevering courage.\r\n\r\nWe have already shown that the only body of regular troops available\r\nfor the succour of Catalonia was the corps of 10,000 men which lay\r\nin the Balearic Islands. That these thirteen battalions of veterans\r\nhad not yet been thrown ashore in the principality was mainly due to\r\nthe over-caution of the aged General Vives, the Captain-General at\r\nPalma, to whom the charge of the garrisons of Majorca and Minorca was\r\ncommitted[311]. He had a deeply rooted idea that if he left Port Mahon\r\nunguarded, the English would find some excuse for once more making\r\nthemselves masters of that ancient stronghold, where the Union Jack\r\nhad waved for the greater part of the eighteenth century. Even the\r\ntransparent honesty of Lord Collingwood, the veteran admiral of the\r\nMediterranean fleet, could not reassure him. It was only when strong\r\npressure was applied to him by his second in command, the Marquis\r\ndel Palacio, governor of Minorca, and when he had received the most\r\nexplicit pledges from Collingwood concerning the disinterested views\r\nof Great Britain, that he consented to disgarnish Port Mahon. His mind\r\nwas only finally made up, when the Aragonese and Catalan battalions\r\nof his army burst out into open mutiny, threatening to seize shipping\r\nand transport themselves to the mainland without his leave, if any\r\nfurther delay was made [June 30]. A fortnight later Vives permitted Del\r\nPalacio, with the greater part of the Balearic garrisons, to set sail\r\nfor the seat of war. The Aragonese regiment landed near Tortosa, and\r\nmarched for Saragossa: but the bulk of the expeditionary force, nearly\r\n5,000 strong, was put ashore in Catalonia between July 19 and 23.\r\n\r\n  [311] Neither Toreño nor Arteche mentions the trouble caused by\r\n  this tiresome old man, to whom the delay in succouring Catalonia\r\n  was due. For the negotiations with him see Lord Collingwood’s\r\n  correspondence (_Life_, ii. 291, 292), and Foy (iv. 181).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile affairs in the principality had taken a new turn. Duhesme\r\nhad remained quiet for six days after Chabran’s check at Granollers,\r\nthough his position at Barcelona grew daily more uncomfortable, owing\r\nto the constant activity of the _somatenes_. But when he learnt that\r\nReille’s vanguard had reached Figueras, and that he might expect ere\r\nlong to be aided by a whole division of fresh troops from the north,\r\nhe resolved to renew his attack on Gerona, the fortress which so\r\ncompletely blocked his communications with France. Sending messages\r\nby sea to bid his colleague meet him under the walls of that place,\r\nhe sallied out from Barcelona, on July 10, with the larger half of\r\nhis army. This time he took with him the French brigades of Goulas\r\nand Nicolas only, leaving Barcelona to the care of Lecchi and the\r\nforeign troops. He felt that the situation was too grave for him to\r\ntrust the fate of Catalonia to the steadiness of Lombard or Neapolitan\r\nregiments. So leaving four Italian and one Swiss battalion, 3,500 men\r\nin all, in the Barcelona forts, he marched for Gerona with seven French\r\nbattalions, a regiment of Italian cavalry, and twenty-two guns, of\r\nwhich ten were heavy siege-artillery. At Mataro he picked up Chabran,\r\nwho had been resting there since his check at Granollers on July 4,\r\nand incorporated with his expedition the Italian battalions which\r\nthat officer had with him, as well as a regiment of French cavalry.\r\nThis gave him a total force of some 7,000 men[312]; yet his march was\r\nslow and difficult. Milans with the _somatenes_ of the upland was\r\nalways hanging upon his left flank, and Lord Cochrane with two British\r\nfrigates followed him along the coast, bombarding his columns whenever\r\nthe road came within cannon-shot of the sea. At Arens de Mar Duhesme\r\nhalted for no less than five days, either from sheer indecision as to\r\nthe advisability of proceeding with his project, or because he was\r\nwaiting for definite news of Reille. At last he made up his mind: two\r\nroutes meet at Arens, the main _chaussée_ from Barcelona to Gerona\r\nvia Tordera, and a cross-road which seeks the same end by a detour\r\nthrough the small hill-fortress of Hostalrich. The three battalions\r\nof Goulas’s brigade were sent by this latter path, with orders to\r\nendeavour to seize the place if they could. The main column, with the\r\nbattering-train, followed the high-road. Goulas found Hostalrich too\r\nstrong for him: it was garrisoned by 500 _miqueletes_ under Manuel\r\nO’Sullivan, a captain of the Regiment of Ultonia, who gallantly\r\nheld their own against an attempt at escalade. The French brigadier\r\nthereupon abandoned the attack, crossed the mountains, and joined his\r\nchief before Gerona on July 22. Duhesme meanwhile had been harassed for\r\nthree days by the _somatenes_ of Milans, and, though he always drove\r\nthem off in the end, had lost much of his baggage, and an appreciable\r\nnumber of men, before he reached the banks of the Ter. On the day after\r\nhe was rejoined by Goulas he forced the passage of that river and took\r\npost before Gerona. On the next morning [July 24] he was rejoiced\r\nto meet with the vanguard of Reille’s division descending from the\r\nnorth. That general had started from Figueras two days before, with\r\nall the fractions of his motley force that had reached the front, two\r\nTuscan battalions, the Swiss from the Valais, three French _bataillons\r\nde marche_, the two ‘Provisional Battalions of Perpignan,’ and some\r\nother improvised units, with a total strength of some 6,500 men. He\r\nestablished his head quarters at Puente Mayor to the north of the city,\r\non the right bank of the Ter, while Duhesme placed his at Santa Eugenia\r\non the left bank. There were good and easy communications between them\r\nby means of two fords, and the bridge of Salt, a little further from\r\nGerona, was also available.\r\n\r\n  [312] The numbers of these corps before the fighting commenced in\r\n  June had been:\r\n\r\n    Goulas’s Brigade (three batts.)       2,574\r\n    Nicolas’s Brigade (four batts.)       2,891\r\n    Two Italian battalions                1,300\r\n    3rd Provisional Cuirassiers             409\r\n    2nd Neapolitan Chasseurs                388\r\n    Artillery                               250\r\n                                          -----\r\n                                          7,812\r\n\r\n  But as the Italians, Goulas, and the cuirassiers had all been\r\n  engaged several times, and had suffered serious losses, we must\r\n  deduct 800 men at least, in order to get the figures of July 17.\r\n  Foy gives only 6,000.\r\n\r\nThirteen thousand men seemed enough to make an end of an old-fashioned\r\nfortress like Gerona, held by a garrison which down to the first day\r\nof the siege counted no more than 400 regular troops--that same Irish\r\nregiment of Ultonia which had stood out against Duhesme’s first attack\r\nin June. It was fortunate for the defenders that at the very moment of\r\nthe arrival of the French they received a powerful reinforcement. The\r\nlight infantry regiment named the 2nd Volunteers of Barcelona, 1,300\r\nstrong, entered the city on the night of July 22[313], slipping between\r\nthe heads of Duhesme’s and Reille’s columns. This corps had formed\r\npart of the garrison of Minorca: instead of being landed at Tarragona\r\nwith the rest of Del Palacio’s troops, it was dropped at San Feliu, the\r\nnearest port on the coast to Gerona, and had just time to reach that\r\nplace before its investment was completed.\r\n\r\n  [313] Not on the twenty-fifth, as Napier says (i. 83), following\r\n  apparently the dates given by Cabanes. I have followed Arteche\r\n  here, as his search into times and seasons seems more careful\r\n  than that of any other authority.\r\n\r\nDuhesme had resolved to avoid for the future the fruitless attempts\r\nat escalade, which had cost him so many men during his first siege of\r\nGerona, and to proceed by the regular rules of poliorcetics. He had\r\nwith him a battering-train more than sufficient to wreck the ancient\r\nwalls of the city: accordingly he opened a secondary attack on the\r\nlower town on the left of the Oña, but turned the greater part of his\r\nattention to the citadel of Monjuich. If this work, which from its\r\nlofty hill commands the whole city, were once mastered, the place could\r\nnot hold out for a day longer. By this arrangement the charge of the\r\nmain attack fell to Reille, and Duhesme himself undertook only the\r\ndemonstration against the Mercadal. The French began by establishing\r\nthemselves on the lower slopes of the tableland of which Monjuich\r\noccupies the culminating point. They found shelter in three ruined\r\ntowers which the garrison was too weak to occupy, and raised near them\r\nthree batteries with six heavy guns and two howitzers, which battered\r\nthe citadel, and also played upon certain parts of the town wall near\r\nthe gate of San Pedro. The batteries in Duhesme’s section of the\r\nsiege-lines consisted only of mortars and howitzers, which shelled and\r\nseveral times set fire to the Mercadal, but could make no attempt to\r\nopen breaches in its walls.\r\n\r\nThe siege-approaches of the French before Gerona were conducted with\r\nan astonishing slowness: it was not till sixteen days after they had\r\nestablished themselves on the slopes round Monjuich, that they began to\r\nbatter it in a serious fashion [Aug. 12]. This delay was partly due to\r\nthe steepness of the ground up which the guns had to be dragged, partly\r\nto the necessity for sending to Figueras for extra artillery material,\r\nwhich could only be brought slowly and under heavy escort to the banks\r\nof the Ter. But Duhesme’s slackness, and the want of skill displayed by\r\nhis engineer officers, were responsible for the greater portion of the\r\ndelay. Moreover the investment of Gerona was so badly managed, that not\r\nonly did the garrison keep up a regular communication at night with\r\nthe chiefs of the _somatenes_ who lay out on the hills to the west,\r\nbut convoys repeatedly left and entered the town in the dark, without\r\nmeeting a single French picket or patrol.\r\n\r\nThis delay of a fortnight in pressing the attack on Gerona led to two\r\nimportant results. The first was that the news of the capitulation of\r\nBaylen reached both camps, producing grave discouragement in the one,\r\nand a disposition for bold action in the other. The second was that Del\r\nPalacio and the troops from Minorca had time granted to them to prepare\r\nfor interference in the siege. The marquis had landed at Tarragona on\r\nJuly 23, with all his division, save the regiment sent to St. Feliu and\r\nthe Aragonese battalion which had been directed on Tortosa. Immediately\r\non his arrival the insurrectionary Junta of Catalonia transferred\r\nitself from Lerida to Tarragona and elected Del Palacio Captain-General\r\nof the principality. Thus a real central authority was established in\r\nthe province, and a single military direction could at last be given\r\nto its armies. The new Captain-General was well-intentioned and full\r\nof patriotism, but no great strategist[314]. His plan was to press\r\nBarcelona with the bulk of his regular forces, so that Lecchi might\r\nbe compelled to call for instant help from Duhesme, while a small\r\ncolumn under the Conde de Caldagues was to march on Gerona, not so much\r\nwith the hope of raising the siege, as to aid the _somatenes_ of the\r\nAmpurdam in harassing the investing force and throwing succours into\r\nthe city[315].\r\n\r\n  [314] Collingwood (_Correspondence_, ii. 271) calls him ‘a fat\r\n  unwieldy marquess, who, if his principles are good, has a very\r\n  limited ability.’\r\n\r\n  [315] For Del Palacio’s intentions see his orders to Caldagues,\r\n  quoted by Arteche (ii. 622).\r\n\r\nAccordingly the main body of Del Palacio’s army, the regiments of\r\nSoria, Granada, and Borbon, with Wimpfen’s two Swiss battalions from\r\nTarragona, marched on the Llobregat, drove in Lecchi’s outposts, and\r\nconfined him to the immediate environs of Barcelona. The _somatenes_\r\ncame to give help in thousands, and a cordon of investment was\r\nestablished at a very short distance from the great city. On the\r\nseaside Lord Cochrane, with the _Impérieuse_ and _Cambrian_ frigates,\r\nkept up a strict blockade, so that Lecchi, with his insufficient and\r\nnot too trustworthy garrison of 3,500 Swiss and Italian troops, was in\r\na most uncomfortable position. If it had not been that Barcelona was\r\ncompletely commanded by the impregnable citadel of Monjuich, he could\r\nnot have maintained his hold on the large and turbulent city. His last\r\noutpost was destroyed on July 31: this was the strong castle of Mongat,\r\nsix miles out on the coast-road from Barcelona to Mataro. It was held\r\nby a company of Neapolitans, 150 men with seven guns. Attacked on the\r\nland-side by 800 _miqueletes_ under Francisco Barcelo, and from the sea\r\nby the broadside of the _Impérieuse_, the Italian officer in command\r\nsurrendered to Lord Cochrane, in order to save his men from massacre\r\nby the Catalans. Cochrane then blew up the castle, and destroyed the\r\nnarrow coast-road on each side of it by cuttings and explosions[316],\r\nso that there was no longer any practicable route for guns, horses,\r\nor wagons along the shore. Thus hemmed in, Lecchi began to send to\r\nDuhesme, by various secret channels, appeals for instant aid, and\r\nreports painting his situation in gloomy but not much exaggerated\r\ncolours. He asserted that the _somatenes_ were pushing their incursions\r\nto within 600 yards of his advanced posts, and that there were now\r\n30,000 Catalans in arms around him. If he had said 10,000 he would have\r\nbeen within the limits of fact.\r\n\r\n  [316] For a good narrative of these operations see Lord\r\n  Cochrane’s autobiography, i. 262-5.\r\n\r\nOn August 6 the Captain-General, after carefully arranging his troops\r\nin the positions round Barcelona, sent off Caldagues to harass Duhesme\r\nin the north. This enterprising brigadier-general was given no more\r\nthan four companies of regulars, three guns, and 2,000 _miqueletes_\r\nfrom the Lerida district under their colonel, Juan Baget. Marching by\r\nthe mountain road that goes by Hostalrich, and picking up many recruits\r\non the way, he established himself on the fourteenth at Castella, in\r\nthe hills that lie between Gerona and the sea. Here he was met by all\r\nthe _somatenes_ of Northern Catalonia, under their daring leaders,\r\nMilans and Claros.\r\n\r\nThe investment of Gerona was so badly managed, that when the news\r\nof Caldagues’ approach was received, two colonels (O’Donovan of the\r\nUltonia Regiment and La Valeta of the Barcelona Volunteers) were able\r\nto penetrate the French lines and to confer with the commander of the\r\narmy of succour. These two officers were really conducting the defence,\r\nfor the titular governor, Bolivar, seems to have been a nonentity[317],\r\nwho exercised no influence on the course of events. At a council of\r\nwar which they attended, it was resolved to try a stroke which was far\r\nbolder than anything that the Captain-General had contemplated when\r\nhe sent Caldagues northward. The relieving force was to attack from\r\nthe rear Reille’s troops on the heights before Monjuich, while at the\r\nsame time every man that could be spared from the garrison was to be\r\nflung on the breaching batteries from the front. Duhesme’s army in the\r\nplain beyond the Oña was to be left alone: it was hoped that the whole\r\nbusiness would be over before he could arrive at the spot where the\r\nfate of battle was to be decided. There were somewhat over 8,000 men\r\ndisposable for the attack: 1,000 regulars and four hundred _miqueletes_\r\nwere to sally out of Gerona: Caldagues could bring up 7,000 more, all\r\nraw levies except the four companies of old troops that he had brought\r\nfrom Tarragona. He had also five field-guns. As Duhesme and Reille had\r\n13,000 men, of whom 1,200 were cavalry, it was a daring experiment\r\nto attack them, even though their forces were distributed along an\r\nextensive line of investment.\r\n\r\n  [317] It is very odd, as Arteche remarks (ii. 611), that none of\r\n  the contemporary Spanish narratives mention the name of Bolivar.\r\n  They only speak of La Valeta and O’Donovan as heading the defence.\r\n\r\nA bold and confident general, placed in Duhesme’s position, would not\r\nhave waited to be attacked in his trenches. The moment that he heard of\r\nthe approach of Caldagues, he would have drawn off half his battalions\r\nfrom the siege, and have gone out to meet the relieving army, before\r\nit could get within striking distance of Gerona. But Duhesme was not\r\nin the mood for adventurous strokes: he was chilled in his ardour by\r\nthe news of the disaster of Baylen: he was worried by Lecchi’s gloomy\r\nreports; and he had been pondering for some days whether it would not\r\nbe well to raise the siege and march off to save Barcelona. But the\r\nravages which his bombardment was producing in the beleaguered city,\r\nand the fact that a breach was beginning to be visible in the walls of\r\nMonjuich, induced him to remain before the place, hoping that it might\r\nfall within the next few days. If this was his determination, he should\r\nat least have made preparations to receive Caldagues: but no attempt\r\nwhatever appears to have been made to resist an attack from without.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of August 16, the Spaniards struck their blow. Between\r\nnine and ten o’clock in the morning, the 1,400 men of the garrison\r\ndeployed from behind the cover of the citadel, and charged down upon\r\nthe trenches and batteries of the besiegers[318]. They completely\r\nswept away the battalion of the 5th Legion of Reserve, which was\r\nfurnishing the guard of the trenches, captured the siege-guns, and set\r\nfire to the fascines of the batteries. Then pushing on, they drove off\r\nthe Swiss battalion of the Valais, and the two Tuscan battalions of the\r\n113th Regiment, pressing them down hill towards Reille’s head quarters\r\nat Puente Mayor. The French general rallied them upon the 1st _Régiment\r\nde Marche_, which formed his reserve at this point of the line, and\r\nmounting the slope retook some of the works which had been lost. But at\r\nthis moment Caldagues’ whole army appeared upon the heights, pressing\r\nforward in four columns with great confidence. The sight of these\r\nmultitudes checked Reille, who hastily drew back, evacuated Puente\r\nMayor and withdrew to the other bank of the Ter. Duhesme, on his side,\r\nabandoned all his outlying positions and concentrated his whole force\r\nin front of the village of Santa Eugenia.\r\n\r\n  [318] The Barcelona Volunteers under La Valeta led; the Ultonia,\r\n  under Major Henry O’Donnell, supported.\r\n\r\nThe Catalans were wise enough not to descend into the plain, where\r\nDuhesme’s cavalry and guns would have had a free hand. Caldagues\r\nrefrained from passing the Ter, and merely drew up his army on the\r\nslopes above Puente Mayor, ready to receive battle. But the expected\r\nattack never came; Duhesme held back all the afternoon, and then fled\r\naway under cover of the darkness. His losses in the fighting on the\r\nhills had not been heavy--seventy-five killed and 196 wounded--but\r\nhis spirit was broken. He would not risk an assault on such a strong\r\nposition with his motley and somewhat demoralized army. For a moment\r\nhe thought of leading his whole force back to Reille’s base at\r\nFigueras: but the reflection that in this case Lecchi would probably be\r\ndestroyed, and he himself be made responsible for the loss of Barcelona\r\nby the Emperor, deterred him from such a cowardly move. Bidding Reille\r\ntake the northern road and keep open the communications with France,\r\nhe drew off the rest of his army to the south to rejoin his Italian\r\ncomrades. The move was made with some panic and precipitation: the\r\nremaining siege-guns were buried in a perfunctory fashion, and some\r\nstores destroyed. Then Duhesme marched away over the mountains, pursued\r\nby the _somatenes_ of Milans; while Reille retired across the plains of\r\nthe Ampurdam, and had a fairly easy journey to Figueras. Claros, who\r\ntried to harass his retreat, never dared to close in upon him in the\r\nopen country, fearing his cavalry and guns. Far more toilsome was the\r\nlot of Duhesme’s column, which had to march for twenty miles through\r\nvery broken ground, chased by the levies of Milans, to whom the whole\r\ndistrict was familiar. When he reached the sea at Malgrat he found that\r\nhis troubles were only growing worse. The _somatenes_ hung on his right\r\nflank, while Lord Cochrane’s frigate the _Impérieuse_ followed him on\r\nthe left hand, giving him a broadside whenever his march lay within\r\ncannon-shot of the beach. Moreover, the peasants had been cutting\r\nand blasting away the road under Cochrane’s direction; and at each\r\npoint where one of these obstructions had been made, it was necessary\r\nto drag the guns and wagons of the column across almost impassable\r\nhillsides[319]. Finding that he was making no appreciable progress, and\r\nthat his men were growing utterly demoralized, Duhesme at last took a\r\ndesperate step. He blew up his ammunition, burnt his baggage, cast his\r\nfield-guns into the sea, and fled away by hill-tracks parallel with the\r\nshore. After long skirmishing with the _somatenes_ he reached Mongat,\r\nwhere Lecchi came out to his aid with 1000 men and a battery--all\r\nthat could be spared from the depleted garrison of Barcelona. There\r\nthe Catalans stayed their pursuit, and Duhesme’s harassed battalions\r\npoured back into the city, sick of mountain warfare, half-starved, and\r\ncarrying with them nothing but what they brought in on their backs\r\n[August 20]. As a fighting force for offensive operations they were\r\nuseless for some weeks, and all that their general could do was to hold\r\nfor foraging purposes as much of the open ground about Barcelona as he\r\ncould manage to retain. Nothing more could be essayed till Napoleon\r\nshould vouchsafe to send heavy reinforcements to Catalonia, for the\r\npurpose of reopening the severed communications with France.\r\n\r\n  [319] See Cochrane’s autobiography, i. 266.\r\n\r\nTwo obvious criticisms on these operations in the month of August must\r\nbe made. The first is that Del Palacio might probably have destroyed\r\nDuhesme’s whole army, if, instead of sending out his lieutenant\r\nCaldagues with a handful of regulars and 2,000 _miqueletes_, he had\r\nmarched on Gerona with his entire force, the 5,000 old troops from\r\nPort Mahon and the whole of the local levies of Central Catalonia.\r\nLecchi was so weak in Barcelona that a few thousand _somatenes_ could\r\nhave kept him in check, for he dared not ungarnish the city. If the\r\nCaptain-General had thrown every man into the struggle at Gerona,\r\nit seems certain that Duhesme must either have been annihilated or\r\nhave fled away with Reille to Figueras, abandoning Barcelona to its\r\ninevitable fate.\r\n\r\nThe second comment is equally obvious: Duhesme’s generalship was even\r\nworse than that of Del Palacio. Since the Spaniards came against him\r\nnot with the whole army of Catalonia, but with a mere detachment of\r\n7,000 _somatenes_, he should have formed a covering force of 5,000\r\nmen, and have fallen upon them while they were still at some distance\r\nfrom Gerona. Instead of doing this, he allowed them to encamp for\r\nthree days unmolested at Castella, a village no more than five miles\r\ndistant from Reille’s outposts. There they concerted their operations\r\nwith the garrison, and fell upon the investing force at the moment that\r\nsuited them best. It is the extraordinary apathy or neglect displayed\r\nby Duhesme that justifies Caldagues’ bold stroke at the French lines.\r\nFinding the enemy so torpid, he might well venture an assault upon\r\nthem, without incurring the charge of rashness of which Napier finds\r\nhim guilty[320]. In other circumstances it would have been mad for the\r\nSpaniard, who had no more than 7,000 _somatenes_, to attack a French\r\narmy 13,000 strong. But seeing Duhesme so utterly negligent--and his\r\narmy strung out on a long front of investment, without any covering\r\nforce--Caldagues was quite justified in making the experiment which\r\nturned out so successfully. Duhesme tried to extenuate his fault, by\r\ngiving out that he had been about to abandon the siege even before he\r\nwas attacked, and that he had orders from Bayonne authorizing such a\r\nstep. But we may be permitted to join his successor St. Cyr in doubting\r\nboth the original intention and the imperial authorization[321]. There\r\nis at least no trace of it in the correspondence of Napoleon, who as\r\nlate as August 23, seven days after the fight outside Gerona, was under\r\nthe impression that Reille’s division alone might suffice to capture\r\nthe city, though he was prepared if necessary to support him with\r\nother troops. On the seventeenth of the same month, the day on which\r\nDuhesme began his disastrous retreat on Barcelona, Napoleon had already\r\nmade up his mind to supersede him, and had directed St. Cyr, with two\r\nfresh divisions, to take post at Perpignan. But in the orders given to\r\nthe new commander in Catalonia there is no sign that the Emperor had\r\nacquiesced in the raising of the siege of Gerona, though it may perhaps\r\nbe deduced from a later dispatch that he had not disapproved of the\r\nstrengthening of Lecchi’s garrison at Barcelona by the withdrawal of\r\nChabran’s division from the leaguer[322].\r\n\r\n  [320] Napier, i. 89.\r\n\r\n  [321] St. Cyr, _Journal de l’Armée de Catalogne_, 1808-9, p. 15.\r\n\r\n  [322] The notices of the army of Catalonia and its intended\r\n  operations are not very numerous in Napoleon’s dispatches. Foy\r\n  accepts Duhesme’s story that he had intended all along to raise\r\n  the siege after receiving from Bayonne an order to suspend active\r\n  operations (iv. 177). But it seems difficult to read this into\r\n  the Emperor’s dispatches; Napoleon received the news of Baylen\r\n  on Aug. 3, but did not begin pushing large reinforcements on to\r\n  Catalonia till Aug. 10 (_Nap. Corresp._, 14,249), nor supersede\r\n  Duhesme by St. Cyr till Aug. 17 (_Nap. Corresp._, 14,256).\r\n  On Aug. 23 he concludes that Duhesme would be best placed at\r\n  Barcelona, but that Reille must take Gerona with his division,\r\n  which may be reinforced by that of Chabot, newly arrived at\r\n  Perpignan, or even by more troops due from Italy in a few weeks.\r\n  The expectation which he expresses, that Reille alone might very\r\n  possibly be strong enough to capture the place, is enough to\r\n  show that he did not intend to raise the siege, but (at most)\r\n  to order Duhesme to strengthen Lecchi with men drawn off from\r\n  the leaguer--which is a very different thing from that general’s\r\n  statement of the case.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Napoleon had recognized that even with Reille’s\r\nreinforcements, Catalonia was not adequately garrisoned, and on August\r\n10 had directed 18,000 fresh troops upon the principality. These,\r\nmoreover, were not the mere sweepings of his dépôts, like Reille’s\r\nmen, but consisted of two strong divisions of old troops; Souham’s was\r\ncomposed of ten French battalions from Lombardy, Pino’s of 10,000 men\r\nof the best corps of the army of the kingdom of Italy[323]. A little\r\nlater the Emperor resolved to send one division more, Germans this\r\ntime, to Catalonia. Instead of the 13,000 men whom he had originally\r\nthought sufficient for the subjugation of the province, he had now\r\nset aside more than 40,000 for the task, and this did not prove to be\r\none man too many. No better testimonial could be given to the gallant\r\n_somatenes_, than that they had forced the enemy to detach so large\r\na force against them. Nor could any better proof be given of the\r\nEmperor’s fundamental misconception of the Spanish problem in May and\r\nJune, than the fact that he had so long been under the impression that\r\nDuhesme’s original divisions would be enough to subdue the rugged and\r\nwarlike Catalan principality.\r\n\r\n  [323] The Emperor writes to Eugène Beauharnais that the 10,000\r\n  Italians, horse, foot, and artillery, must be ‘un extrait de\r\n  l’armée italienne dans le cas de se faire honneur,’ the best that\r\n  could be got (_Dispatch_ 14,249, Aug. 10).\r\n\r\nBefore Souham, Pino, and the rest could arrive on the scene, many\r\nweeks must elapse, and meanwhile we must turn back to the main course\r\nof the war in Central Spain, where the condition of affairs had been\r\nprofoundly modified by the results of the Capitulation of Baylen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI\r\n\r\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF BAYLEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH RETREAT TO THE EBRO\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile dealing with the operations of the French armies in the various\r\nprovinces of Spain, we have observed that at every point the arrival\r\nof the news of Dupont’s disaster at Baylen produced notable results.\r\nIt was this unexpected intelligence that drove the intrusive king out\r\nof Madrid within a week of his arrival, and ere the ceremonial of his\r\nproclamation had been completed. It brought back Bessières from the\r\nEsla to the Arlanzon, and raised the siege of Saragossa. Knowing of\r\nit Junot summoned his council of war at Torres Vedras with a sinking\r\nheart, and Duhesme lacked the confidence to try the ordeal of battle\r\nbefore Gerona. Beyond the Pyrenees its influence was no less marked.\r\nNapoleon had imagined that the victory of Rio Seco had practically\r\ndecided the fate of the Peninsula, and at the moment of Baylen was\r\nturning his attention to Austria rather than to Spain. On July 25,\r\nfive days after Dupont had laid down his arms, he was meditating the\r\nreinforcement of his army in Germany, and drafting orders that directed\r\nthe garrisons of northern France on Mainz and Strasburg[324]. To a\r\nmind thus preoccupied the news of the disaster in Andalusia came like\r\na thunderclap. So far was the Spanish trouble from an end, that it\r\nwas assuming an aspect of primary importance. If Austria was really\r\nintending mischief, it was clear that the Emperor would have two great\r\ncontinental wars on his hands at the same moment--a misfortune that\r\nhad never yet befallen him. It was already beginning to be borne in\r\nupon him that the treachery at Bayonne had been a blunder as well as a\r\ncrime. Hence came the wild rage that bursts out in the letters written\r\nupon the days following that on which the news of Baylen reached him\r\nat Bordeaux. ‘Has there ever, since the world began,’ wrote Bonaparte\r\nto Clarke, his minister of war, ‘been such a stupid, cowardly, idiotic\r\nbusiness as this? Behold Mack and Hohenlohe justified! Dupont’s own\r\ndispatch shows that all that has occurred is the result of his own\r\ninconceivable folly.... The loss of 20,000 picked men, who have\r\ndisappeared without even inflicting any considerable loss on the\r\nenemy, will necessarily have the worst moral influence on the Spanish\r\nnation.... Its effect on European politics will prevent me from going\r\nto Spain myself.... I wish to know at once what tribunal ought to try\r\nthese generals, and what penalty the law can inflict on them for such\r\na crime[325].’ A similar strain runs through his first letter to his\r\nbrother Joseph after the receipt of the news--‘Dupont has soiled our\r\nbanners. What folly and what baseness! The English will lay hands on\r\nhis army[326]. Such events make it necessary for me to go to Paris,\r\nfor Germany, Poland, Italy, and all, are tied up in the same knot.\r\nIt pains me grievously that I cannot be with you, in the midst of\r\nmy soldiers[327].’ In other letters the capitulation is ‘a terrible\r\ncatastrophe,’ ‘a horrible affair, for the cowards capitulated to save\r\ntheir baggage,’ and (of course) ‘a machination paid for with English\r\ngold[328]. These imbeciles are to suffer on the scaffold the penalty\r\nof this great national crime[329].’ The Emperor did well to be angry,\r\nfor the shock of Baylen was indeed felt to every end of Europe. But he\r\nshould have blamed his own Macchiavellian brain, that conceived the\r\nplot of Bayonne, and his own overweening confidence, that launched\r\nDupont with 20,000 half-trained conscripts (not, as he wrote to\r\nClarke, with _vingt mille hommes d’élite et choisis_) on the hazardous\r\nAndalusian enterprise.\r\n\r\n  [324] Napoleon to Jerome, King of Westphalia, July 25 (_Nap.\r\n  Corresp._, 14,230): ‘L’Autriche arme: elle nie ses armements,\r\n  elle arme donc contre nous.... Puisque l’Autriche arme, il faut\r\n  donc armer. Aussi j’ordonne que la Grande Armée soit renforcée.\r\n  Mes troupes se réunissent à Strasbourg, Mayence, Wesel,’ &c.\r\n  Compare this with the great harangue made to Metternich on August\r\n  15 (_Nap. Corresp._, 14,254) and with _Nap. Corresp._, 14,248,\r\n  which discusses the co-operation of Russia in a war with Austria.\r\n\r\n  [325] Napoleon to Clarke, Aug. 3 (_Nap. Corresp._, 14,242).\r\n\r\n  [326] i.e. Napoleon is aware that they will never allow the army\r\n  to be taken home by sea, as the capitulation provided.\r\n\r\n  [327] Napoleon to Joseph, Aug. 3 (_Nap. Corresp._, 14,243):\r\n  ‘L’Allemagne, l’Italie, la Pologne etc., tout se lie,’ is the\r\n  Emperor’s phrase.\r\n\r\n  [328] _Nap. Corresp._, 14,244, 14,272, 14,283.\r\n\r\n  [329] A few words as to Dupont’s fate may be added. His\r\n  experiences during the next four years throw a curious light\r\n  on the administration of military justice under the Empire.\r\n  He, together with Vedel, Chabert, Marescot, Legendre, and the\r\n  aide-de-camp Villoutreys, were arrested on returning to France,\r\n  and thrown into prison. They were told to prepare for a trial\r\n  before the Supreme High Court (_Haute Cour Impériale_), and\r\n  a long series of interrogatories was administered to them. A\r\n  military commission drew up a preliminary report on the case:\r\n  on reading it the Emperor saw that Dupont had a fair defence to\r\n  make on all the charges brought against him, with the exception\r\n  of that of military incapacity. He countermanded the order for\r\n  a trial, and the prisoners (after nine months of confinement)\r\n  were released, but left under police surveillance. After Dupont\r\n  had spent two years and a half of peace in the country-house of\r\n  a relative, he was suddenly arrested at midnight on Feb. 12,\r\n  1812, and given a secret trial, not before a court of justice or\r\n  a court-martial, but before a special military commission. He\r\n  was allowed neither counsel nor documents, and forced to defend\r\n  himself at forty-eight hours’ notice. The judges declared him\r\n  guilty of having signed a capitulation containing ‘des conditions\r\n  honteuses et avilissantes,’ but not of having surrendered without\r\n  necessity, or of having shown cowardice or treason. Since the\r\n  capitulation had been ‘contrary to the political interests of\r\n  the Empire, and had compromised the safety of the State,’ while\r\n  yet ‘there would be grave inconvenience in giving the accused a\r\n  public trial,’ the court advised the Emperor to deprive Dupont of\r\n  rank, title, and pension, and to relegate him to the country. The\r\n  other accused officers might suffer the same penalties. Refusing\r\n  to consider this a sufficient punishment, Napoleon shut up Dupont\r\n  in the lonely fort of Joux, in the Jura, where he remained a\r\n  prisoner till the fall of the Empire. Vedel and Legendre were\r\n  pardoned, and afterwards served in Italy. Chabert and Villoutreys\r\n  were put on half-pay.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he had to face the situation: within a few hours of the\r\nmoment when Villoutreys placed Dupont’s dispatch in his hands, he had\r\nso far got over the first spasms of his wrath that he was able to\r\ndictate a general plan for the reconcentration of his armies[330]. We\r\nhave compared the French forces in Spain to a broad wedge, of which\r\nthe point, directed against the heart of the insurrection, was formed\r\nby the three divisions of Dupont’s corps. This point had now been\r\nbroken off; but the Emperor, still clinging to the idea of the wedge,\r\nwished to preserve Madrid and to form in and about it a new army fit\r\nfor offensive operations. With this force he would strike at the\r\ninsurgents of Andalusia and Valencia when they marched on the capital,\r\nwhile Bessières in the valley of the Douro, and Verdier in the valley\r\nof the Ebro were still to preserve a forward position, and shield the\r\narmy of the centre from the flank attacks of the Galicians and the\r\nAragonese. The troops left around Madrid at the moment of the disaster\r\nof Baylen were parts of the three divisions of Moncey’s corps[331],\r\none of Dupont’s, and the brigade which had escorted Joseph Napoleon\r\nfrom Burgos, together with 3,000 horse--a total of about 23,000 men.\r\nBonaparte judged that this was not enough to resist the combined attack\r\nof Castaños and of the Valencians and Murcians of Saint March and\r\nLlamas. Accordingly he intended that Bessières should lend the King two\r\nbrigades of infantry--a deduction from his force which would compel him\r\nto fall back from Leon into Old Castile[332]--and that Verdier should\r\nspare a brigade from the army in front of Saragossa[333], though it was\r\nnone too strong for the task before it. Six battalions from the reserve\r\nat Bayonne were to make a forced march to Madrid to join the King. Thus\r\nreinforced up to 35,000 men, the corps at Madrid would be able, as\r\nthe Emperor supposed, to make head against any combination of Spanish\r\ntroops that could possibly be brought against it.\r\n\r\n  [330] The ‘Note sur la situation actuelle de l’Espagne,’ which\r\n  forms No. 14,241 of the _Correspondance_.

Bonaparte at Bordeaux was\r\nseparated from his brother at the Retiro by so many miles that his\r\norders were grown stale before they reached their destination. His\r\nscheme was made out on August 2, but on the preceding day King Joseph\r\nand his whole army had evacuated Madrid. The terror of Baylen was\r\nupon them, and they were expecting every moment to find themselves\r\nattacked by Castaños, who was as a matter of fact celebrating triumphal\r\nfeasts at Seville. With a haste that turned out to be altogether\r\nunnecessary, Moncey’s corps, escorting the King, his court, and his\r\nlong train of Spanish refugees, crossed the Somosierra and did not\r\nhalt till they reached Aranda de Duero, in the plains of Old Castile.\r\nNapoleon was forced to make other plans in view of this retreat, whose\r\nmoral consequences were hardly inferior in importance to those of\r\nDupont’s capitulation. For both the Spanish nation and the courts of\r\nEurope looked upon the evacuation of Madrid as marking the complete\r\ndownfall of Napoleon’s policy, and portending a speedy retirement of\r\nthe invaders behind the Pyrenees. It is certain that if the spirit of\r\nJoseph and his advisers had been unbroken, they might have clung to the\r\ncapital till the reinforcements which the Emperor was hurrying to their\r\naid had arrived. It is probable that the 35,000 men, of whom Savary\r\nand Moncey could then have disposed, might have held Castaños in check\r\ntill the army from the Rhine had time to come up. Yet there is every\r\nexcuse for the behaviour of the French commanders, for they could not\r\npossibly have known that the Spaniards would move with such astonishing\r\nslowness, or that they would refrain from hurling every available man\r\non Madrid. And as a matter of fact the evacuation of the capital turned\r\nout in the end to be advantageous to Napoleon, for it inspired his\r\nadversaries with a foolish self-confidence which proved their ruin. If\r\nthey had been forced to fight hard in New Castile, they would have been\r\nobliged to throw much more energy into the struggle, and could not have\r\nslackened their efforts under the false impression that the French were\r\nabsconding in dismay to Bayonne.\r\n\r\nWhen Bonaparte learnt that his brother had fled from Madrid and crossed\r\nthe passes into Old Castile, he was forced to draw out a wholly\r\ndifferent scheme from that which he had sketched on August 2. The\r\nKing, he wrote, with Moncey’s corps, must take post at Aranda, where\r\nthe Douro is crossed by the high-road from France to Madrid. His army\r\nshould be strengthened to a force of 30,000 men: meanwhile Bessières\r\nand Verdier must protect his flanks. The former with 15,000 men should\r\ntake Valladolid as his head quarters and guard against any attempt\r\nof Blake to resume the offensive. As to Verdier, since he had been\r\ninstructed to abandon the siege of Saragossa--a grave blunder--he must\r\nbe drawn back as far as Tudela on the Middle Ebro. From that point he\r\nwould easily be able to ‘contain’ the tumultuary army of Palafox. If\r\nthe Spaniards showed signs of pressing in on any part of the front,\r\nthe King, Verdier, or Bessières--as the case might demand--must not\r\nhang back, but endeavour to shatter the vanguard of any advancing\r\nforce by a bold stroke. At all costs the war must not be waged in a\r\ntimid style--in short, to adopt a well-known military axiom, ‘the\r\nbest defensive would be a vigorous local offensive[334].’ Meanwhile\r\nit should be known that enormous reinforcements were in march from\r\nthe Rhine and the Elbe. This was indubitably correct, for on August 5\r\nthe 1st and 6th Corps of the ‘Grand Army,’ and two divisions of heavy\r\ncavalry, had been sent their orders to break up from their garrisons\r\nand set out for Spain[335]. The Viceroy of Italy and the Princes of\r\nthe Confederation of the Rhine had also been directed to send large\r\ncontingents to the Peninsula: the troops from Italy were to move on\r\nPerpignan and strengthen the army of Catalonia; those from the German\r\nstates were to march on Bayonne and join the main army[336]. Somewhat\r\nlater the Emperor directed still further masses of men to be drawn\r\noff from Germany, namely Marshal Mortier with the 5th Corps and two\r\nmore divisions of dragoons[337], while the whole of the Imperial Guard\r\ncame down from Paris on the same errand[338]. There were still nearly\r\n100,000 of the old army left in Spain[339], and the reinforcements\r\nwould amount to 130,000 more, a force which when united would far\r\nsurpass both in numbers and in quality any army that the Spaniards\r\nwould be able to get together in the course of the next two months.\r\n\r\n  [334] Note on the situation of Spain, Aug. 5 (_Nap.

Once more the distances\r\nof space and time were too much for him. Before the dispatch from\r\nRochefort came to hand, Joseph and Savary had already abandoned Aranda:\r\nthey left it on the sixth and by the ninth were at Burgos. At that city\r\nthey were met by Bessières, who according to the King’s orders had\r\nfallen back from the Esla to the Arlanzon. Napoleon’s elaborate scheme\r\nfor the maintenance of the line of the Douro had thus fallen through,\r\nas completely as his earlier plan for the defence of Madrid. Seeing\r\nthat his orders were clearly out of date, Moncey and Bessières[340]\r\nagreed that they might be disregarded. The next line suitable for an\r\narmy acting on the defensive was that of the Ebro, and to the banks of\r\nthat river the dispirited army of France now withdrew.\r\n\r\n  [340] Savary had left the army on Aug. 4, and returned to France.\r\n\r\nThe head quarters were established at Miranda: the troops of Bessières\r\nand Moncey were massed at that place and at Logroño, with a strong\r\ndetachment across the Ebro at Pancorbo, and some cavalry lying out\r\nas far as Burgos: Verdier’s army, after finally raising the siege of\r\nSaragossa, fell back on Milagro, the point where the Aragon falls into\r\nthe Ebro. Thus some 70,000 men were concentrated on a comparatively\r\nshort and compact front, covering the two great roads which lead to\r\nFrance by Vittoria and by Pampeluna. Against any frontal attack from\r\nthe direction of Madrid the position was very strong. But a glance at\r\nthe map shows that the flanks were not properly protected: there was\r\nnothing to prevent Blake from turning the extreme right by an advance\r\ninto Biscay, or to prevent Palafox from turning the extreme left by\r\na march on Pampeluna via Tafalla or Sanguesa. If either of these\r\nmoves were made by a powerful force, the army on the Ebro would be\r\ncompelled either to abandon its positions in order to go in pursuit,\r\nor else to leave them occupied by a detachment insufficient to resist\r\na serious attack along the line of the high-road from Madrid. Both\r\nthose operations were ultimately taken in hand by the Spaniards, but\r\nit was at too late an hour, when the reinforcements from Germany had\r\nbegun to arrive, and when ample means were at the disposal of the\r\nFrench generals for repulsing flank attacks, without drawing off men\r\nfrom the line of the Ebro. The astounding slowness of the Spaniards,\r\nand the lamentable want of union between the commanders of the various\r\nprovincial armies, ruined any chance that there might have been of\r\nsuccess. The troops of King Joseph were safely installed in their\r\ndefensive positions by August 15. On that day the leading columns of\r\nthe Spanish army had only just arrived at Madrid. It was not till a\r\nmonth later that the number of troops brought forward to the line of\r\nthe Ebro approached the total strength of the host of the intrusive\r\nKing. The offensive operations of Blake and Palafox did not commence\r\ntill the second half of September, when the columns of the ‘Grand Army’\r\nwere already drawing near to the Pyrenees, and all possible chance\r\nof success had long gone by. They were not developed till October,\r\nwhen the counter-stroke of the French was fully prepared. From August\r\n15 down to the day of the battle of Zornoza (October 31) there are\r\ntwo months and a half of wasted time, during which the Spaniards\r\ndid nothing more than stir up an ineffectual rising in Biscay and\r\ngradually push to the front scattered corps whose total did not amount\r\nto much more than 100,000 men. The troops of Bonaparte on the other\r\nhand--now under the orders of Jourdan, who arrived at Miranda on August\r\n25[341]--had little to do but to ward off the feeble attempts to cut\r\ntheir communications in Biscay, and to incorporate, brigade by brigade,\r\nthe numerous reinforcements which kept marching in from Bayonne. For\r\neven ere the three veteran corps from Germany came to hand, there\r\nwas a continuous stream of troops pouring across the Pyrenees. Most\r\nimportant, perhaps, of all the arrivals was that of Marshal Ney, the\r\ntoughest and most resolute of all the Emperor’s fighting-men, who\r\nbrought with him a spirit of enterprise and confidence which had long\r\nbeen wanting in the army of Spain[342].\r\n\r\n  [341] See his _Mémoires_ (pp. 66, 67) for the situation at this\r\n  date.\r\n\r\n  [342] He arrived at Irun on Aug. 30 (_Madrid Gazette_, Sept.\r\n  17th, 1808).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCREATION OF THE ‘JUNTA GENERAL’\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 1, Madrid had seen the last of the French: yet it was not\r\ntill the thirteenth that the Spanish troops appeared before the gates\r\nof the capital. Even then it was not the victorious army of Andalusia\r\nwhich presented itself, but only the Valencian corps of Llamas, a mere\r\ndivision of 8,000 men, which would not have dared to push forward,\r\nhad it not known that Joseph Bonaparte and all his train were now far\r\non their way towards the Ebro. During the thirteen days which elapsed\r\nbetween his departure and the arrival of the Valencians there was\r\na curious interregnum in Madrid. It took some time to convince the\r\npopulace and the local authorities that the hated invaders were really\r\ngone, and that they were once more their own masters. Nothing reflects\r\nthe state of public opinion better than the _Madrid Gazette_: down to\r\nAugust 1, it shows the hand of a French editor; ‘His Majesty’ means\r\nKing Joseph, and all the foreign intelligence is coloured with French\r\nviews. On August 2 the foreign influence begins to disappear, and we\r\nnote a very cautious and tentative proclamation by the old ‘Council\r\nof Castile.’ That effete body, shorn by the French of most of its\r\nprominent members, had repeatedly yielded to the orders of Murat and\r\nSavary: it had carried out many decrees of the new executive, yet it\r\nhad never actually recognized the legality of King Joseph’s accession.\r\nIndeed at the last moment it had striven, by feeble methods of evasion\r\nand delay, to avoid committing itself to this final step. But we may\r\nguess that, had there been no Baylen, the Council would finally have\r\nmade up its mind to ‘swallow the pill’--if we may use once more Murat’s\r\ncharacteristic phrase. However, the flight of Joseph had saved it\r\nfrom being forced to range itself on the side of the traitors, and\r\nits members were able to stay behind in Madrid without fearing for\r\ntheir necks. In their first manifesto there is not a word that could\r\nhave offended Savary, if he had returned the next day. It preaches\r\nthe necessity of calm, order, and quiet: no one must stir up mobs,\r\ncompromise the public safety, or vex his respectable neighbours[343].\r\nThe rest of the paper on this and the two following days is filled\r\nup with essays on geography and political economy, lists of servants\r\nseeking places, and colourless foreign news many weeks old. Such\r\npiteous stuff was not likely to keep the people quiet: on August 4 a\r\nmob assembled, broke open the house of Don Luis Viguri (one of Godoy’s\r\nold confidants), murdered him, and dragged his body through the\r\nstreets. Fearing that they too might be considered _Afrancesados_ the\r\nCouncil published a second proclamation of the most abject kind. The\r\n‘melancholy instance of insubordination’ of the previous day causes\r\nthem ‘intolerable sorrow’ and is ‘unlikely to tend to public felicity.’\r\nThe loyal and generous citizens ought to wait for the working of the\r\nlaw and its ministers, and not to take the execution of justice into\r\ntheir own hands. The clergy, the local officials, every employer of\r\nlabour, every father of a family, are begged to help to maintain peace\r\nand order. Then comes a page of notices of new books, and a short paper\r\non the ethics of emigration! Of Ferdinand VII or Joseph I, of politics\r\ndomestic or foreign, there is not a word. Two days later the Council at\r\nlast makes up its mind, and, after a week of most uncomfortable sitting\r\non the fence, suddenly bursts out into an ‘Address to the honourable\r\nand generous people of the capital of Spain,’ in the highest strain\r\nof patriotism: ‘Our loved King is in chains, but his loyal subjects\r\nhave risen in his name. Our gallant armies have achieved triumphs over\r\n“the invincibles of Marengo, Austerlitz, and Jena.” All Europe stands\r\nsurprised at their rapid victories. These fellow citizens of ours,\r\ncrowned with the laurels of success, will soon be with us. Meanwhile\r\nthe Council must beg the patriotic citizens of Madrid to abstain from\r\nriot and murder, and to turn their energies into more useful channels.\r\nLet them prostrate themselves before the altar in grateful thanks\r\nto God, and make preparations to receive and embrace the oncoming\r\nbands of liberators.’ Domestic intelligence becomes for the future a\r\nlist of French atrocities, and of (sometimes apocryphal) victories\r\nin the remoter corners of Spain[344]. Foreign intelligence is served\r\nup with an English rather than a French flavour. The arsenal of\r\n‘Volovich[345]’ is shipping scores of cannon and thousands of muskets\r\nfor the use of the brave Spaniards, the treasures of Great Britain\r\nare to be poured into the hands of the insurrectionary Juntas, and\r\nso forth. All this comes a little late: the good intentions of the\r\nCouncil would have been more clear if they had been expressed on August\r\n2 instead of August 7, when the French were still at Buitrago, rather\r\nthan when they were far away beyond Aranda de Duero[346].\r\n\r\n  [343] Proclamation of the Council, dated Aug. 1, published Aug. 2\r\n  in the _Gazette_. There is an original copy of the broadsheet in\r\n  the _Vaughan Papers_.\r\n\r\n  [344] On Aug. 9 the reader is invited to believe that Roussillon\r\n  has risen against Napoleon, and that the peasantry have stormed\r\n  its frontier-fortress of Bellegarde.\r\n\r\n  [345] i.e. Woolwich.\r\n\r\n  [346] It is hard to agree with Napier’s verdict that ‘The Council\r\n  was not wanting to itself; the individuals comprising it did\r\n  not hesitate to seize the reins of power when the French had\r\n  departed, and the prudence with which they preserved tranquillity\r\n  in the capital, and prevented all reaction, proves that they were\r\n  not without merit, and forms a striking contrast to the conduct\r\n  of the provincial Juntas, under whose savage sway every kind of\r\n  excess was committed and even encouraged’ (Napier, i. 299).\r\n\r\nIt is really astonishing to find that the Council made a bid for power,\r\nand attempted to assume the pose of a senate of warm-hearted patriots,\r\nafter all its base servility to Murat and Savary during the last six\r\nmonths. Its president, Don Arias Mon y Velarde, actually had the\r\naudacity to write a circular-note to the various provincial Juntas of\r\nSpain, proposing that, as a single central government must obviously\r\nbe established, they should send representatives to Madrid to concert\r\nwith the Council on means of defence, and lend it the aid of their\r\ninfluence and authority. That such a discredited body should attempt\r\nto assume a kind of presidential authority over the local Juntas who\r\nhad raised and directed the insurrection was absurd. The replies which\r\nwere returned were of the most uncompromising kind: the Galician Junta\r\ntaunted the Council with having been ‘the most active instrument of\r\nthe Usurper.’ Palafox, speaking for Aragon, wrote that it ‘was a\r\ncorporation which had not done its duty.’ The active and ambitious\r\nJunta of Seville wished to accuse the Council before the face of the\r\nSpanish people ‘of having subverted the fundamental laws of the realm,\r\nof having given the enemy every facility for seizing the domination of\r\nSpain, of having lost all legal authority and become null and void, and\r\nof being suspected of deliberate treason of the most atrocious sort\r\npossible.’ The Valencians voted that ‘no public body of any kind ought\r\nto enter into correspondence with the Council of Castile, or come\r\nto any understanding with it[347].’ All these rebuffs to the Council\r\nwere well deserved, and it is clear that the provincial Juntas were\r\nentirely justified in their action. But it is to be feared that there\r\nlay at the bottom of their hearts not merely honest indignation at the\r\nimpudent proposal that had been laid before them, but a not unnatural\r\ndesire to cling as long as possible to their existing power and\r\nauthority. In many of the provinces there was shown a most unworthy and\r\nunwise reluctance to proceed at once to the construction of a single\r\ngoverning body for Spain, even when the proposal was put forward not\r\nby a discredited corporation like the Council, but by men of undoubted\r\npatriotism.\r\n\r\n  [347] All these quotations come from the documents inserted by\r\n  Toreño in his fifth book (i. 262).\r\n\r\nThe credit of starting a serious agitation for the erection of a\r\n‘Supreme Junta’ must be given to the Murcians, whose councils were\r\nguided by the old statesman Florida Blanca, a survivor from the days\r\nof Charles III. As far back as June 22 they had issued a proclamation\r\nsetting forth the evils of provincial particularism, and advocating\r\nthe establishment of a central government. None of the other Juntas\r\nventured openly to oppose this laudable design, and some of them did\r\ntheir best to further it. But there were others who clung to power,\r\nand were determined to surrender it at as late a date as they could\r\nmanage. The Junta of Seville was far the worst: that body--as we have\r\nhad occasion to mention in another place--was largely in the hands\r\nof intriguers, and had put forth unjustifiable claims to domination\r\nin the whole southern part of the realm, even usurping the title of\r\n‘Supreme Junta of Spain and the Indies[348].’ In their desire for\r\nself-aggrandizement they took most unjustifiable steps: they suppressed\r\nFlorida Blanca’s Murcian proclamation, lest it might stir up an\r\nagitation in Andalusia in behalf of the establishment of a central\r\ngovernment[349]. But this was a comparatively venial sin: their worst\r\nact was to stay the march of Castaños on Madrid after Baylen. The\r\npretext used was that they wished to welcome the victorious general\r\nand his army with triumphal entries and feasts of rejoicing--things\r\nentirely out of place, so long as the French were still holding the\r\ncapital of the realm. To his own entire dissatisfaction Castaños was\r\ndragged back to Seville, there to display the captured guns and flags\r\nof the French, and to be received with salvos fired by patriotic\r\nladies who had learnt the drill of the artilleryman[350]. But he\r\nsoon found to his disgust that the Junta was really aiming at the\r\nemployment of his troops not for national purposes but for their own\r\naggrandizement. They wished to speak with 40,000 men at their back,\r\nand were most reluctant to let the army pass the Sierra Morena, lest\r\nit should get out of their control. Their most iniquitous design was\r\nto overawe by armed force their neighbours, the Junta of Granada, who\r\nrefused to recognize them as a central authority for Andalusia, and had\r\ngiven their assent to the Murcian proposal for the prompt formation of\r\na national government. They were actually issuing orders for a division\r\nto march against the Granadans, when Castaños--though a man of mild\r\nand conciliatory manners--burst out in wrath at the council board.\r\nSpringing up from his chair and smiting the table a resounding blow,\r\nhe exclaimed, ‘Who is the man that dares bid the troops march without\r\nmy leave? Away with all provincial differences: I am the general of\r\nthe Spanish nation, I am in command of an honourable army, and we are\r\nnot going to allow any one to stir up civil war[351].’ Conscious that\r\nthe regiments would follow the victor of Baylen, and refuse obedience\r\nto mere civilians, the Junta dropped their suicidal project. But\r\nthey turned all their energy into devising pretexts for delaying the\r\nmarch of the army on Madrid. Their selfishness was undisguised: when\r\nCastaños begged for leave to march on the capital without further\r\ndelay[352], the Conde de Tilly (the most intriguing spirit among\r\nall the politicians of Seville) responded with the simple question,\r\n‘And what then will become of _us_?’ He then moved that the Junta of\r\nAndalusia should concern itself with Andalusia and Portugal alone, and\r\nnot interfere in what went on beyond the Sierra Morena. This proposal\r\nwas a little too strong even for the narrow-minded particularists of\r\nthe Junta: but though they let Castaños go, they contrived excuses for\r\ndelaying the march of the greater part of his army. He did not get to\r\nMadrid till August 23, more than a month after Baylen, and then brought\r\nwith him only the single division of La Peña, about 7,000 strong. The\r\nother three divisions, those of Reding, Jones, and Coupigny, did not\r\ncross the Sierra Morena for many weeks after, and some of the troops\r\nhad not even left Andalusia at the moment when the French resumed\r\noffensive operations in October. On various specious pretences the\r\nJunta detained many regiments at Seville and Cadiz, giving out that\r\nthey were to form the nucleus of a new ‘army of reserve,’ which was\r\nstill a mere skeleton three months after Baylen had been fought. If we\r\ncompare the Andalusian army-list of November with that of July, we find\r\nthat only seven new battalions[353] had joined the army of Castaños in\r\ntime to fight on the Ebro. It is true that a new division had been also\r\nraised in Granada, and sent to Catalonia under General Reding, but this\r\nwas due to the energy of the Junta of that small kingdom, which was far\r\nmore active than that of Seville. Andalusia had 40,000 men under arms\r\nin July, and no more than 50,000 at the beginning of November, though\r\nthe Junta had promised to have at least thirty reserve battalions ready\r\nbefore the end of the autumn, and had received from England enormous\r\nstores of muskets and clothing for their equipment.\r\n\r\n  [348] See page 69.\r\n\r\n  [349] Lord Collingwood’s _Correspondence_, ii. 98.\r\n\r\n  [350] Arteche, ii. 124.\r\n\r\n  [351] Toreño, i. 264.\r\n\r\n  [352] This story is told by Lord Collingwood, in an official\r\n  dispatch to Castlereagh, dated July 29.

The main sources of\r\ntrouble were the rivalry of the Juntas of Asturias and Galicia, and\r\nthe extravagant claims of the aged and imbecile Cuesta, in virtue of\r\nhis position as Captain-General of Castile. It will be remembered\r\nthat in June insurrectionary Juntas had been established at Leon\r\nand Valladolid, the former purporting to represent the kingdom of\r\nLeon, the latter the kingdom of Old Castile. Each had been under\r\nthe thumb of Cuesta, who looked upon them as nothing more than\r\ncommittees established under his authority for the civil government\r\nof the provinces of the Douro. But the disaster of Medina de Rio Seco\r\ndestroyed both the power and the credit of the Captain-General. Flying\r\nbefore the French, the Juntas took refuge in Galicia, where they\r\nsettled down at Ponferrada for a few days, and then moved to Lugo,\r\nwhither the Junta of Galicia came out to meet them. The three bodies,\r\njoining in common session, chose as their president Don Antonio Valdes,\r\nthe Bailiff of the Knights of Malta, who was one of the representatives\r\nof Castile. They claimed to be recognized as the supreme civil\r\ngovernment of Northern Spain, but their position was weakened by two\r\nmischances. The Asturian Junta refused to have anything to do with\r\nthem, and persisted in remaining sovereign within the borders of its\r\nown principality. Even more vexatious was the conduct of Cuesta: though\r\nhe was wandering in the mountains with only three or four thousand\r\nraw levies--the wrecks of Rio Seco--he refused to recognize any\r\nauthority in the three federated Juntas, and pretended to revoke by his\r\nproclamation any powers vested in those of Castile and Leon. The fact\r\nwas that he knew that they would lend support to his military rival\r\nBlake, and not to himself. He feigned to regard the Captains-General\r\nand the old _Audiencias_, or provincial tribunals, as the sole\r\nlegitimate powers left in the kingdom, and to consider the Juntas\r\nas irregular assemblies destitute of any valid authority. In what a\r\nscandalous form he translated his theories into action, we shall soon\r\nsee. Meanwhile he refused to co-operate with the troops of Galicia, and\r\nmade no attempt to follow the retreating French. All his efforts were\r\ndirected to increasing the numbers of the mass of raw levies which he\r\ncalled the ‘Army of Castile.’ But from the whole of the provinces over\r\nwhich he claimed authority he had only succeeded in scraping together\r\n12,000 men by the middle of September, though as far as population went\r\nthey represented nearly a sixth of the people of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe want of any central executive for directing the armies of the\r\npatriots had the most disastrous results. By September 1 Castaños and\r\nLlamas had not more than 20,000 men at Madrid. Galluzzo’s army of\r\nEstremadura, which ought to have joined them long before, was still\r\nemployed in its futile siege of Elvas. Cuesta was hanging back in\r\nCastile, as jealous of Castaños as he had been of Blake. The only\r\narmies which were in touch with the French were Palafox’s troops on\r\nthe Ebro and the Valencian division of Saint March, which the Junta of\r\nValencia (showing more patriotism than most of their colleagues) had\r\npushed up to Saragossa to aid the Aragonese. Blake, with the powerful\r\narmy of Galicia, had descended to Astorga when Bessières retreated to\r\nBurgos. But from Astorga he advanced most cautiously, always clinging\r\nto the southern slope of the Cantabrian hills, in order to avoid the\r\nplains, where the cavalry of the French would have a free hand. It\r\nwas not till September 10 that he had concentrated his main body at\r\nReynosa, near the sources of the Ebro, where he was at last near enough\r\nto the front to be able to commence operations.\r\n\r\nThe whole month of August, it is not too much to say, was lost for\r\nmilitary purposes because Spain had not succeeded in furnishing itself\r\nwith a central government or a commander-in-chief. It had been wasted\r\nin constitutional debates of the most futile kind. To every one, except\r\nto certain of the more selfish members of the Juntas, it was clear\r\nthat a way must be found out of the existing anarchy. Three courses\r\nseemed possible: one was to appoint a Regent, or a small Council of\r\nRegency, and to entrust to him (or to them) the conduct of affairs.\r\nThe second was to summon the Cortes, the old national parliament of\r\nSpain. The third was to establish a new sort of central government,\r\nby inducing each of the existing Juntas to send deputies, with full\r\npowers of representation, to sit together as a ‘Supreme Central Junta’\r\nfor the whole realm. The project of appointing a Regent had at first\r\nmany advocates: it occurred to both Castaños and Palafox, and each (as\r\nit chanced) pitched upon the same individual as most worthy of the\r\npost[354]. This was the Archduke Charles of Austria, the sole general\r\nin Europe who had won a military reputation of the first class while\r\ncontending with the French. He would have been an excellent choice--if\r\nonly he could have been secured. But it did not take much reflection\r\nto see that if Austria allowed her greatest captain to accept such a\r\npost, she would involve herself in instant war with Bonaparte, and if\r\nsuch a war broke out the Archduke would be wanted on the Danube rather\r\nthan upon the Ebro. There was no other name likely to command general\r\nconfidence. Some spoke of the Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo[355], the\r\nlast prince of the Spanish royal house who remained in the realm. But\r\nhe was an insignificant and incapable person, and much discredited by\r\nhis dallyings with Murat in the days before the insurrection had begun.\r\nClearly he would be no more than a puppet, worked by some astute person\r\nbehind the viceregal throne. Other names suggested were those of the\r\nyoung Dom Pedro of Portugal (son of the Prince-Regent John), and of\r\nPrince Leopold, the son of Ferdinand IV of Sicily. The former was a\r\ngrandson, the latter a nephew of Charles IV. Both therefore were near\r\nto the throne, but both were foreigners, young, untried in matters of\r\nstate, and utterly unknown to the Spaniards. Dom Pedro’s claims were\r\nnot strongly pushed, but the Sicilian court made a strenuous attempt\r\nto forward those of Prince Leopold. Their ambassador in London tried to\r\nenlist the support of the English Government for him: but Canning and\r\nCastlereagh were anxious to avoid any appearance of dictating orders\r\nto Spain, and firmly refused to countenance the project. Before their\r\nreply came to hand, King Ferdinand (or rather that old intriguer, his\r\nspouse, and her son-in-law the Duke of Orleans) sent the prince to\r\nGibraltar, on a man-of-war which they had obtained from Mr. Drummond,\r\nthe British minister at Palermo. By lending his aid to the plan this\r\nunwise diplomat almost succeeded in compromising his government. But\r\nmost fortunately our representatives in Spain nipped in the bud this\r\nintrigue, which could not have failed to embroil them with the Juntas,\r\nnone of whom had the least love for the Sicilian house. When the\r\n_Thunderer_ arrived at Gibraltar [August 9] Sir Hew Dalrymple--then\r\njust on the eve of starting for Portugal--refused to allow the prince\r\nto land, or to distribute the proclamations which he had prepared.\r\nThese were the work of Leopold’s brother-in-law, Louis Philippe of\r\nOrleans, who had accompanied him from Palermo with the design of\r\nfishing in troubled waters, a craft of which he was to show himself\r\nin later days a past master. If Leopold should become regent, Orleans\r\nintended to be the ‘power behind the throne.’ Dalrymple detained the\r\ntwo princes at Gibraltar, and when he was gone Lord Collingwood[356]\r\ntook the same attitude of hostile neutrality. Tired of detention,\r\nLouis Philippe after a few days sailed for London, in the vain hope of\r\nmelting the hearts of the British Cabinet. The Sicilian prince lingered\r\nsome time, protesting against the fashion in which he was treated,\r\nand holding secret colloquies with deputations which came to him from\r\nmany quarters in which the Junta of Seville was detested. But there\r\nwas no real party in his favour. What benefit could come to Spain from\r\nthe election of a youth of nineteen, whose very name was unknown to\r\nthe people, and who could help them neither with men nor with money,\r\nneither with the statesmanship that comes from experience, nor with the\r\nmilitary capacity that must be developed on the battle-field? After\r\nremaining long enough in Spanish waters to lose all his illusions,\r\nPrince Leopold returned to his mother in Sicily[357]. There had\r\nnever been any foundation for a persistent rumour that he was to be\r\nmade co-regent along with the Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo and the\r\nConde de Montijo. Not even the least intelligent members of the Juntas\r\nwould have consented to hand over the rule of Spain to this strange\r\ntriumvirate--an imbecile, a boy, and a turbulent intriguer. There was\r\nabout as much chance that another vain project might be carried out--an\r\ninvitation to General Dumouriez to take command of all the Spanish\r\narmies. Yet this plan too was seriously brought forward: the Frenchman\r\nwould not have been unwilling, but the Spanish officers, flushed with\r\ntheir recent successes, were not the kind of people to welcome a\r\nforeign leader, and one whose last military exploit had been to desert\r\nhis own army and go over to the enemy.\r\n\r\n  [354] See Arteche, iii. 118.\r\n\r\n  [355] First cousin to Charles IV, being the son of the Infante\r\n  Luis, and brother of Godoy’s unfortunate wife.\r\n\r\n  [356] Napier is wrong in hinting that Canning lent himself to the\r\n  Sicilian scheme (i. 177, 178) in order to disoblige Castlereagh.\r\n  Collingwood’s dispatches show that he opposed it, as much as\r\n  did Dalrymple, and thereby won approval from his government\r\n  (_Collingwood Correspondence_, ii. 216, 217).\r\n\r\n  [357] He sailed on Nov. 4 (_Madrid Gazette_).\r\n\r\nMuch more specious, at first sight, than any project for the\r\nestablishment of a regency, was the proposal mooted in many quarters\r\nfor the summoning of the Cortes--whose name recalled so many ancient\r\nmemories, and was connected with the days of constitutional freedom in\r\nthe Middle Ages. But not only had the Cortes been obscured by the long\r\nspell of autocracy under the Hapsburg and Bourbon kings, but it was by\r\nits very constitution unsuited to represent a nation seeking for a new\r\nand vigorous executive. It was full of mediaeval anomalies: for example\r\nthe Asturias had never been represented in it, but had possessed (like\r\nWales in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries) separate governmental\r\nmachinery of its own. This might have been altered without much\r\ndifficulty, but it was more fatal that the distribution of seats in the\r\nlower estates represented an archaic survival. Many decayed towns in\r\nCastile sent members to the Cortes, while on the other hand the warlike\r\nand populous province of Galicia had only one single vote. To rearrange\r\nthe representation on a rational basis would take so long, and cause\r\nso much provincial jealousy, that it was recognized as practically\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThere remained therefore only the third plan for creating a supreme\r\ngovernment in Spain--that which proposed that the various existing\r\nJuntas should each send deputies to some convenient spot, and that the\r\nunion of these representatives should constitute a central authority\r\nfor the whole realm. This scheme was not so clearly constitutional\r\nas the summoning of the Cortes would have been, nor did it provide\r\nfor real unity of direction in so complete a way as would have been\r\nsecured by the appointment of a single Regent. But it had the practical\r\nadvantage of conciliating the various provincial Juntas: though they\r\nsacrificed their local sovereignty, they obtained at least the power\r\nof nominating their own masters. In each of them the more active and\r\nambitious members hoped that they might secure for themselves the\r\nplaces of delegates to the new supreme assembly. Accordingly the\r\nJuntas were induced, one after another, to consent to the scheme.\r\nPublic opinion ran so strongly in favour of unity, and the existing\r\nadministrative chaos was so clearly undesirable, that it was impossible\r\nto protest against the creation of a Supreme Central Junta. Some of the\r\nprovinces--notably Murcia, Valencia, and Granada--showed a patriotic\r\nspirit of self-abnegation and favoured the project from the first. Even\r\nGalicia and Seville, where the spirit of particularism was strongest,\r\ndared not openly resist the movement. There were malcontents who\r\nsuggested that a federal constitution was preferable to a centralized\r\none, and that it would suffice for the provinces to bind themselves\r\ntogether by treaties of alliance, instead of handing themselves over to\r\na newly created executive. But even in Aragon, where federal union with\r\nCastile seemed more attractive to many than complete incorporation,\r\nthe obvious necessity for common military action determined the\r\nsituation[358]. Every province of Spain at last adhered to the project\r\nfor constructing a Supreme Central Junta. Even the narrow-minded\r\npoliticians at Seville had to assume an attitude of hearty consent. But\r\ntheir reluctance peeped out in the suggestion which they made that the\r\nJunta should meet, not at Madrid, but at Ciudad Real or Almagro in La\r\nMancha, places convenient to themselves, but obscure and remote in the\r\neyes of inhabitants of Asturias or Galicia. Their aversion to Madrid\r\nwas partly caused by its remoteness from their own borders, but much\r\nmore by jealousy of the Council of Castile, which still hung together\r\nand exercised local authority in the capital. Other Juntas showed\r\ntheir aversion for the Council in the same way, and ultimately the\r\nplace selected for the gathering of the new government was the royal\r\nresidence of Aranjuez, which stands to Madrid much as do Versailles\r\nor Windsor to Paris and London. This choice was an obvious mistake:\r\nthe central government of a country loses in dignity when it does not\r\nreside in the national capital. It seems to distrust its own power or\r\nits legality, when it exiles itself from its proper abode. At the best\r\nit casts a slur on the inhabitants of the capital by refusing to trust\r\nitself among them. Madrid, it is true, is not to Spain what Paris is\r\nto France, or London to England: it is a comparatively modern place,\r\npitched upon by Philip II as the seat of his court, but destitute of\r\nancient memories. Nevertheless, it was at least infinitely superior to\r\nAranjuez as a meeting-place. On geographical or strategical grounds\r\nthey are so close that no advantage accrues to one that does not belong\r\nto the other. But for political reasons the capital was distinctly\r\npreferable to the almost suburban palace[359]. If the existence of the\r\nCouncil of Castile so much disturbed the Junta, it would have been\r\nquite possible to dissolve that discredited body. No one would have\r\nmade any serious effort in its favour, even in the city of its abode.\r\n\r\n  [358] Note the federalist views of the Aragonese Miguel Principe,\r\n  quoted by Arteche (ii. 121).\r\n\r\n  [359] Both Florida Blanca and Jovellanos were in favour of making\r\n  Madrid the meeting-place. The Andalusians defeated them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE ‘JUNTA GENERAL’ IN SESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe provincial Juntas, when once they had consented to sacrifice\r\ntheir local sovereignty, made no great delay in forwarding their\r\nrepresentatives to the chosen meeting-place at Aranjuez. The number of\r\ndeputies whom they sent to the Supreme Central Junta was thirty-five,\r\nseventeen provincial Juntas each contributing two, and the Canary\r\nIslands one. The Biscayan provinces, still wholly in the possession\r\nof the French, had no local body to speak for them, and could not\r\ntherefore choose deputies. The number thus arrived at was not a very\r\nconvenient one: thirty-five is too few for a parliament, and too many\r\nfor an executive government. Moreover proportional representation was\r\nnot secured; Navarre and the Balearic Islands were given too much\r\nweight by having two members each. Andalusia, having eight deputies\r\nfor its four Juntas of Seville, Jaen, Granada, and Cordova, was\r\nover-represented when compared with Galicia, Aragon, and Catalonia,\r\nwhich had each no more than two. The quality of the delegates was very\r\nvarious: among the most notable were the ex-ministers Florida Blanca\r\nand Jovellanos, who represented respectively the better sides of the\r\nConservative and the Liberal parties of Spain--if we may use such\r\nterms. The former, trained in the school of ‘benevolent despotism’\r\nunder Charles III, was a good specimen of the eighteenth-century\r\nstatesman of the old sort--polite, experienced, energetic, a ripe\r\nscholar, and an able diplomat. But he was eighty years old and failing\r\nin health, and his return to active politics killed him in a few\r\nmonths. Jovellanos, a somewhat younger man[360], belonged in spirit\r\nto the end rather than the middle of the eighteenth century, and was\r\nimbued with the ideas of liberty and constitutional government which\r\nwere afloat all over Europe in the early days of the French Revolution.\r\nHe represented modern liberalism in the shape which it took in Spain.\r\nFor this reason he had suffered many things at the hands of Godoy,\r\nand emerged from a long period of imprisonment and obscurity to take\r\nhis place in the councils of the nation. Unhappily he was to find that\r\nhis ideas were still those of a minority, and that bureaucracy and\r\nobscurantism were deeply rooted in Spain.\r\n\r\n  [360] He was born in 1743.\r\n\r\nOf the other members[361] of the Supreme Junta, the Bailiff Valdez and\r\nFrancisco Palafox, fresh from his brother’s triumphs at Saragossa, were\r\nperhaps the best known. Among the rest we note a considerable number of\r\nclergy--two archbishops, a prior, and three canons--but not more than\r\nmight have been expected in a country where the Church was so powerful.\r\nMilitary men were not so strongly represented, being only five in\r\nnumber, and three of these were militia colonels. The rest were mainly\r\nlocal notables--grandees, marquises, and counts predominated over mere\r\ncommoners. Some of them were blind particularists, and a few--like the\r\ndisreputable Conde de Tilly--were intriguers with doubtful antecedents.\r\nThe whole body represented Spain well enough, but Spain with her\r\nweaknesses as well as her strong points. It was not a very promising\r\ninstrument with which to achieve the liberation of the Peninsula, or to\r\nresist the greatest general in Europe. Considered as a government of\r\nnational defence, it had far too little military knowledge: a haphazard\r\nassembly of priests, politicians, and grandees is not adapted for the\r\nconduct of a war of independence. Hence came the incredible blindness\r\nwhich led it to refuse to appoint a single commander-in-chief, and the\r\nobstinacy with which it buried itself in constitutional debates of the\r\nmost futile sort when Napoleon was thundering at the gates of Spain.\r\n\r\n  [361] For a complete list of the names and professions of the\r\n  members of the Junta, see the Appendix.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the Supreme Junta was fixed for September 25, but long\r\nere that date came round the military situation was assuming new\r\ndevelopments. The first modification in the state of affairs was caused\r\nby the abortive attempt of the Basque provinces to free themselves. The\r\nnews of Baylen had caused as great a stir in the northern mountains as\r\nin the south or the east of Spain. But Biscay, Guipuzcoa, and Alava\r\nhad considerable French garrisons, and the retreat of Joseph Bonaparte\r\nto the Ebro only increased the number of enemies in their immediate\r\nneighbourhood. It would have been no less patriotic than prudent for\r\nthese provinces to delay their insurrection till it had some chance of\r\nproving useful to the general scheme of operations for the expulsion\r\nof the French from Spain. If they could have waited till Blake and\r\nCastaños had reached the Ebro, and then have taken arms, they might\r\nhave raised a most dangerous distraction in the rear of the French, and\r\nhave prevented them from turning all their forces against the regular\r\narmies. But it was mad to rise when Blake was still at Astorga, and\r\nCastaños had not yet reached Madrid. It could not have been expected\r\nthat the local patriots should understand this: but grave blame falls\r\non those who ought to have known better. The Duke of Infantado, who\r\nwas acting under Blake, and Colonel Doyle, the English representative\r\nat that general’s head quarters, did their best to precipitate the\r\noutbreak in Biscay. They promised the Biscayan leaders that a division\r\nfrom Asturias should come to their aid, and that English arms and\r\nammunition should be poured into their harbours[362]. At the first\r\nword of encouragement all Biscay took arms [August 6]: a great mass of\r\ninsurgents collected at Bilbao, and smaller bands appeared along the\r\nline of the mountains, even as far as Valcarlos on the very frontier\r\nof France. But no external aid came to them: the Asturians--averse to\r\nevery proposal that came from Galicia--did not move outside their own\r\nprovincial boundary, and no other Spanish army was within striking\r\ndistance. Bessières was able, at his leisure, to detach General Merlin\r\nwith 3,000 men to fall on Bilbao. This brigade proved enough to deal\r\nwith the main body of the Biscayan insurgents, who after a creditable\r\nfight were dispersed with heavy loss--1,200 killed, according to the\r\nFrench commander’s dispatch [August 16]. Bilbao was taken and sacked,\r\nand English vessels bringing--now that it was too late--5,000 stand\r\nof arms for the insurgents, narrowly escaped capture in its harbour.\r\nAll along the line of the Basque hills there was hanging and shooting\r\nof the leaders of the abortive rising[363]. The only result of this\r\nill-advised move was that Bessières was warned of the danger in his\r\nrear, and kept a vigilant eye for the future on the coastland. The\r\nBiscayans, as was natural, were much discouraged at the way in which\r\nthey had been left in the lurch by their fellow countrymen, and at\r\nthe inefficacy of their own unaided efforts. They were loth to rise a\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\n  [362] See the letters of Doyle quoted in Napier, i. 287.\r\n\r\n  [363] Joseph Bonaparte to Napoleon, Sept. 5, 1808.\r\n\r\nIt was not till twenty days had passed since the fall of Bilbao\r\nthat the first attempts at combined action were made by the Spanish\r\ngenerals. On September 5 there met at Madrid a council of war,\r\ncomposed of Castaños, Cuesta, the Valencian General Llamas, and the\r\nrepresentatives of Blake and Palafox--the Duke of Infantado and Calvo\r\nde Rozas, intendant-general of the army of Aragon. These officers met\r\nwith much suppressed jealousy and suspicion of each other. The Duke\r\nhad his eye on Cuesta, in accordance with the instructions of Blake.\r\nCastaños and Cuesta were at daggers drawn, for the old Captain-General\r\nhad just proposed a _coup d’état_ against the Junta to the Andalusian,\r\nand had been repulsed with scorn[364]. The representative of the army\r\nof Aragon had been charged to see that no one was put above the head\r\nof Palafox. When the meeting opened, Cuesta proposed that it should\r\nappoint a single general to direct all the forces of Spain. The\r\nothers demurred: Cuesta was much their senior in the army-list, and\r\nthey imagined--probably with truth--that he would claim the post of\r\ncommander-in-chief for himself, in spite of the memories of Cabezon\r\nand Rio Seco. They refused to listen to his arguments, though it was\r\ncertain that unity of command was in every way desirable. Nor was any\r\ndisposition shown to raise Castaños to supreme authority, though this\r\nwas the obvious step to take, as he was the only general of Spain who\r\nhad won a great battle in the open field. But personal and provincial\r\njealousy stood in the way, and Castaños himself, though not without\r\nambition, was destitute of the arts of cajolery, and made no attempt to\r\npush his own candidature for the post of commander-in-chief. Perhaps\r\nhe hoped that the Supreme Junta would do him justice ere long, and\r\nrefrained for that reason from self-assertion before his colleagues.\r\nNothing, therefore, was settled on September 5, save a plan for common\r\noperations against the French on the Ebro. Like all schemes that are\r\nformed from a compromise between the views of several men, this was\r\nnot a very brilliant strategical effort: instead of providing for a\r\nbold stroke with the whole Spanish army, at some point on the long line\r\nbetween Burgos and Milagro, it merely brought the insurgent forces\r\nin half-a-dozen separate columns face to face with the enemy. Blake,\r\nwith his own army and the Asturians, was to be asked to concentrate\r\nnear Reynosa, at the sources of the Ebro, and to endeavour to turn\r\nBessières’ flank and penetrate into Biscay[365]. He would have 30,000\r\nmen, or more, but not a single complete regiment of cavalry. Next to\r\nhim Cuesta was to operate against the front of Bessières’ corps, with\r\nhis ‘Army of Castile,’ eight or nine thousand raw levies backed by\r\nabout 1,000 horse. He undertook to make Burgo de Osma his point of\r\nstarting. More to the east, Castaños was to gather at Soria the four\r\ndivisions of the army of Andalusia, but at present he had only that of\r\nLa Peña in hand: the Junta of Seville was detaining the rest. Still\r\nmore to the right, Llamas with his 8,000 Valencians and Murcians was\r\nto march on Tudela. Lastly Palafox, with the army of Aragon and the\r\nValencian division of Saint March, was to keep north of the Ebro, and\r\nturn the left flank of Moncey’s corps by way of Sanguesa: he could\r\nbring about 25,000 men into line, but there were not more than five or\r\nsix regular battalions among them; the rest were recent levies. When\r\nthe army of Estremadura should come up (it was still about Elvas and\r\nBadajoz), it was to join Castaños; and it was hoped that the English\r\nforces from Portugal might also be directed on the same point.\r\n\r\n  [364] I find the story of Cuesta’s projected _coup d’état_ (in\r\n  Toreño, i. 267), which was supposed to rest on the authority\r\n  of Castaños alone, completely corroborated in Sir Charles\r\n  Vaughan’s private diary. On Sept. 15 Vaughan, while passing\r\n  through Segovia, met Cuesta, who told him ‘that two measures\r\n  were absolutely necessary: (1) the abolition of the provincial\r\n  Juntas, and the restoration of the ancient authority of the\r\n  Captains-General and _Real Audiencia_; (2) _The exercise of\r\n  military force_ over the Junta at Ocaña (i.e. the supreme\r\n  ‘Central Junta’) sufficient to compel them to elect an executive\r\n  council of three or five persons to be placed at the head of\r\n  different departments, and to be responsible to the nation at\r\n  large.’ This is precisely what Cuesta proposed to Castaños.\r\n\r\n  [365] So Toreño. Arteche says that he was to concentrate at\r\n  Aranda.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile only 75,000 men were available in the first line; and\r\nthis force, spread along the whole front from Reynosa to Sanguesa, and\r\nacting on wide external lines, was not likely to make much impression\r\non the French. The numbers of the invaders were considerably greater\r\nthan those of the patriot-armies. Jourdan had 70,000 men by September\r\n1, and was being reinforced every day by fresh battalions, though the\r\nthree corps from Germany were still far off. Before the Spaniards\r\ncould move he appreciably outnumbered them, and he had the inestimable\r\nadvantage of holding a comparatively short front, and of being able to\r\nconcentrate on any point with far greater rapidity than was possible to\r\nhis adversaries. Even had they thrown all their forces on one single\r\npoint, the French, always using the ‘interior lines,’ could have got\r\ntogether in a very short time. The only weak point, indeed, in the\r\nFrench position was that Bessières’ vanguard at Burgos was too far\r\nforward, and in some peril of being enveloped between Blake and Cuesta.\r\nBut this detachment, as we shall see, was ere long drawn back to the\r\nEbro.\r\n\r\nBefore the campaign began the Spaniards obtained one notable\r\nadvantage--the removal of Cuesta from command, owing to his own\r\nincredible arrogance and folly. It will be remembered that he regarded\r\nthe Juntas of Leon and Castile as recalcitrant subordinates of his own,\r\nand had declared all their acts null and void. When they proceeded,\r\nlike the other Juntas, to elect representatives for the meeting at\r\nAranjuez, he waited till the deputies of Leon were passing near his\r\ncamp, and then suddenly descended upon them. Don Antonio Valdez, the\r\nBailiff of the Maltese Knights, and the Vizconde de Quintanilla, were\r\narrested by his troopers and shut up in the castle of Segovia. He\r\nannounced that they should be tried by court-martial, for failing in\r\nobedience to their Captain-General. This astonishing act of presumption\r\ndrew down on him the wrath of the Supreme Junta, which was naturally\r\neager to protect its members from the interference of the military\r\narm. Almost its first act on assembling was to order him to appear\r\nat Aranjuez and to suspend him from command. Cuesta would have liked\r\nto resist, but knowing that his own army was weak and that Blake and\r\nCastaños were his bitter enemies, he had to yield. He came to Aranjuez,\r\nand was superseded by General Eguia. Valdez and Quintanilla were\r\nimmediately released, and took their seats in the Supreme Junta.\r\n\r\nThe sessions of that body had begun on September 25. Twenty-four\r\nmembers out of the designated thirty-five had assembled on that day,\r\nand after a solemn religious ceremony had re-proclaimed Ferdinand VII,\r\nand elected Florida Blanca as their President. They then proceeded to\r\nnominate a Cabinet, chosen entirely from outside their own body. Don\r\nPedro Cevallos was to be Minister of Foreign Affairs: he had served\r\nFerdinand VII in that capacity, but had smirched his reputation by his\r\nsubmission to Bonaparte after the treachery at Bayonne. However, his\r\ningenious justification[366] of his conduct, and his early desertion\r\nof King Joseph, were allowed to serve as an adequate defence. Don\r\nAntonio Escaño was Minister of Marine, Don Benito Hermida Minister\r\nof Justice, Don Francisco de Saavedra Minister of the Interior. The\r\nmost important place of all, that of Minister of War, was given to\r\nan utterly unknown person, General Antonio Cornel, instead of to\r\nany of the officers who had distinguished themselves during the\r\nrecent campaigns. He was to be aided by a supreme council of war,\r\nconsisting of six members of the Junta, three of whom were civilians\r\nwithout any military knowledge whatever. No intention of appointing\r\na commander-in-chief was shown, and the Minister of War corresponded\r\ndirectly with all the generals in charge of the provincial armies.\r\nNothing could have been more ill judged; from the want of a single\r\nhand at the helm all the oncoming operations were doomed to inevitable\r\nfailure. The supreme direction was nominally entrusted to the obscure\r\nwar-minister and his councillors, really it lay with the generals in\r\nthe field, who obeyed orders from head quarters only just as much as\r\nthey chose. Each played his own game, and the result was disaster.\r\n\r\n  [366] His very elaborate vindication of himself can be read\r\n  in his pamphlet of September, 1808, which was translated into\r\n  English in the same winter, and reprinted in London. It contains\r\n  a good account of the Bayonne business, and many valuable state\r\n  papers.\r\n\r\nA glance at the subjects which were discussed by the members of\r\nthe Junta, during its first weeks of session, suffices to show the\r\nshort-sightedness of their policy, and their utter inability to grasp\r\nthe situation. They should have remembered that they were a government\r\nof national defence, whose main duty was the expulsion of the French\r\nfrom the soil of Spain. But military subjects furnished the smallest\r\nportion of their subjects of debate. They published indeed a manifesto\r\nto the effect that they intended to levy an army of 500,000 foot, and\r\n50,000 horse--a much greater force than Spain in her most flourishing\r\ndays could have raised or maintained. But this paper army was never\r\nseen in the field: less than a third of the number were under arms\r\nat the moment in December when the Junta had to fly from Aranjuez,\r\nbefore the advancing legions of Napoleon. Nor was it likely that a\r\ngreat army could be raised, equipped, and disciplined, while the\r\ncentral government was devoting the greater part of its attention to\r\nfutilities. The most cruel comment on its work lies in the fact that\r\nits troops were ill furnished, badly armed, and half starved, at the\r\nmoment when the provinces were doing their best to provide equipment,\r\nand every port in Spain was gorged with cannon, muskets, munitions, and\r\nstores sent from England--a great part of them destined to fall into\r\nthe hands of the French. Partly from want of experience, but still more\r\nfrom want of energy, the Junta failed to use the national enthusiasm\r\nand the considerable resources placed at its disposal.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the main topics of its debates we begin to understand\r\nits failures. A good deal of time was spent in voting honorary\r\ndistinctions to its own members. The President was to be addressed\r\nas ‘his highness,’ the Junta as a corporation was ‘its majesty,’ if\r\nwe may use the ludicrous phrase. Each member became ‘his excellency’\r\nand received the liberal salary of 120,000 reals (£1,200), besides\r\nthe right of wearing on his breast a gold plaque with an embossed\r\nrepresentation of the eastern and western hemispheres. There was a\r\ngood deal of dispensing of places and patronage in the army and the\r\ncivil service among relatives and dependencies of ‘their excellencies,’\r\nbut not more perhaps than happens in other countries in war-time when\r\na new government comes in. At least the changes led to the getting\r\nrid of a good many of Godoy’s old bureaucrats. The real fault of the\r\nJunta lay in its readiness to fall into factions, and fight over\r\nconstitutional questions that should have been relegated to times of\r\npeace. Among the thirty-five members of the Junta a clear majority\r\nwere, like their president, Florida Blanca, Spaniards of the old\r\nschool, whose ideas of government were those of the autocratic sort\r\nthat had prevailed under Alberoni and Charles III. They looked upon\r\nall innovations as tinged with the poison of the French Revolution and\r\nsavouring of Jacobinism and infidelity. On the other hand there was a\r\npowerful minority, headed by Jovellanos and including Martin de Garay,\r\nthe secretary of the Junta, the Marquis of Campo Sagrado, Valdes,\r\nCalvo de Rozas, and others, who held more modern views and hoped that\r\nthe main result of the war would be to make Spain a constitutional\r\nmonarchy of the English type. How far this dream was from realization\r\nwas shown by the fact that among the first measures passed through\r\nthe Supreme Junta were ordinances allowing the Jesuits (expelled long\r\nsince by Charles III) to return to Spain, recreating the office of\r\nInquisitor-General, and suspending the liberty of the press. Such\r\nmeasures filled the liberal section in the Junta with despair, by\r\nshowing the narrow and reactionary views of the majority. But the\r\ngreater part of the time spent in session by ‘its majesty’ was wasted\r\non purely constitutional questions. Firstly there was a long polemic\r\nwith the Council of Castile, whose hatred for the Junta took the form\r\nof starting doubts as to the legality of its constitution[367]. It\r\nsuggested that all constitutional precedents were against a body so\r\nnumerous as thirty-five persons taking charge of the governance of\r\nthe realm. Former councils of regency had been composed of three or\r\nfive members only, and there was no legal authority for breaking the\r\nrule. The Council suggested that the only way out of the difficulty\r\nwould be to call the Cortes, and that assembly would at once supersede\r\nthe authority of the Supreme Junta. Instead of arguing with the\r\nCouncil of Castile, the new government would have done well to arrest\r\nor disperse that effete and disloyal body; but it chose instead to\r\nindulge in a war of manifestos and proclamations which led to nothing.\r\nTo find the supreme government consenting to argue about its own\r\nlegality was not reassuring to the nation. Moreover, Jovellanos and\r\nhis followers spent much time in impressing on their colleagues that\r\nit was their duty to appoint a regency, and to cut down their own\r\nunwieldy numbers, as well as to provide machinery for the summoning\r\nof the Cortes at some not too distant date. To be reminded that they\r\nwere no permanent corporation, but a temporary committee dressed in\r\na little brief authority, was most unpleasant to the majority. They\r\ndiscussed from every point of view the question of the regency and\r\nthe Cortes, but would not yield up their own supremacy. Indeed they\r\nproposed to begin legislation on a very wide basis for the reform of\r\nthe constitution--business which should rather have been left to the\r\nCortes, and which was particularly inappropriate to the moment when\r\nNapoleon was crossing the Pyrenees. The great manifesto of the Junta\r\n[October 26] sets forth its intentions very clearly. ‘The knowledge and\r\nillustration of our ancient and constitutional laws; the changes which\r\naltered circumstances render necessary in their re-establishment; the\r\nreforms necessary in civil, criminal, and commercial codes; projects\r\nfor improving public education; a system of regulated economy for the\r\ncollection and distribution of the public revenue ... are the subjects\r\nfor the investigation of wise and thoughtful men. The Junta will form\r\ndifferent committees, each entrusted with a particular department, to\r\nwhom all writings on matters of government and administration may be\r\naddressed. The exertions of each contributing to give a just direction\r\nto the public mind, the government will be enabled to establish the\r\ninternal happiness of Spain[368].’ From another official document we\r\nlearn that ‘among the most grave and urgent objects of the attention of\r\nthe Central Junta will be the encouragement of agriculture, the arts,\r\ncommerce, and navigation[369].’\r\n\r\n  [367] For these documents see the _Madrid Gazette_ of Oct. 4.\r\n\r\n  [368] Manifesto of the Junta to the Spanish people, Oct. 26.\r\n\r\n  [369] _Madrid Gazette_ of Oct. 18, p. 1,301.\r\n\r\nClearly nothing could be more inappropriate and absurd than that this\r\ngovernment of national defence should turn its attention to subjects\r\nsuch as the reform of national education, or the encouragement of the\r\narts. It is equally certain that if it should propose to ‘consider\r\nthe changes necessary in our ancient laws,’ it would be going beyond\r\nits competence; for such business belonged only to a permanent and\r\nproperly constituted national assembly, such as the Cortes. This was\r\nnot the time for constitutional debates, nor was the Central Junta the\r\nbody that should have started them. All their energies should have\r\nbeen devoted to the war. But misled as to the situation by the long\r\nquiescence of the French army on the Ebro, they turned their minds to\r\nevery topic that should have been avoided, and neglected the single one\r\nthat should always have been before their eyes. It was in vain that\r\nCalvo de Rozas, the Aragonese deputy, and a few more, tried to keep\r\ntheir colleagues to the point. The majority fell to debating on the\r\nsubjects on which the despotic and the liberal theories of government\r\nclash, and spent themselves on discussions that were as heated as they\r\nwere futile. Meanwhile the time that should have been turned to account\r\nwas slipping away, and the army was not being reinforced. A glance\r\nat the field-states of the Spanish troops, comparing those of August\r\n1 with those of November 1, sufficiently proves this. The provinces\r\nwhich had been recovered by the retreat of the French to the Ebro were\r\nnot doing their duty. The wide and populous regions of Old Castile\r\nand Leon had sent 4,600 men to Rio Seco in July: in October they had\r\nless than 12,000 under arms[370]. From New Castile there seem to have\r\nbeen raised nothing more than four battalions of Madrid Volunteers,\r\na weak cavalry regiment, and two battalions of _Cazadores de Cuenca_\r\nand _Tiradores de Castilla_: at any rate no troops but these are to\r\nbe found recorded in the lists of the armies that fought in October,\r\nNovember, and December, 1808. Even allowing that New Castile may have\r\nsupplied recruits to its own corps of embodied militia serving with the\r\nAndalusian army[371], it is clear that, with a population of 1,200,000\r\nsouls, it ought to have done much more in raising new regiments. And\r\nthis was the district in whose very midst the Junta was sitting! What\r\nlittle was done in Madrid seems to have been mainly the result of\r\nprivate enterprise: the _Gazette_ for October is full of voluntary\r\ndonations of horses, saddlery, and money, for the equipment of a corps\r\nof dragoons for the army of Old Castile, and of similar gifts received\r\nby Calvo de Rozas for the army of Aragon. But there are no signs of\r\nrequisitions by the government for the purpose of raising an army of\r\nNew Castile, which could certainly have been done. The kingdom with\r\nits five provinces ought to have given 40,000 men instead of 4,000:\r\nfor Asturias, with only 370,000 souls, had raised 13,000: Aragon\r\nwith 650,000 had placed no less than 32,000 levies in the field: and\r\nEstremadura with 420,000 had sent to the front 12,000 men by October,\r\nwhile keeping 10,000 more of undrilled recruits in its dépôts[372].\r\nNew Castile, as we have already had occasion to remark, had 1,200,000\r\ninhabitants, and yet had only added to its original five battalions\r\nof militia six more of volunteers, and a single regiment of horse, at\r\nthe moment when Napoleon’s armies came flooding across the Ebro. The\r\nCentral Junta’s authority in Andalusia or Galicia was much limited\r\nby the survival of the ambitious local Juntas. But in Leon and the\r\ntwo Castiles there was, when once Cuesta had been got out of the way,\r\nno rival power in the field. No one was to blame but the central\r\ngovernment, if the full resources of those regions were not utilized\r\nin September, October, and November. The English representatives at\r\nMadrid saw all this, and did their best to stir up the Junta. But it\r\nwas not likely that mere foreigners would succeed, where Castaños\r\nand the other more energetic Spanish officers had failed. Already in\r\nOctober the situation appeared most unpromising: ‘We have made repeated\r\nrepresentations,’ wrote Mr. Stuart, the British minister, ‘and I have\r\ngiven in paper after paper, to obtain something like promptitude and\r\nvigour: but though loaded with fair promises in the commencement,\r\nwe scarcely quit the members of the Junta before their attention is\r\nabsorbed in petty pursuits and in wrangling, which impedes even the\r\nsimplest arrangements necessary for the interior government of the\r\ncountry.... In short, we are doing what we can, not what we wish: and I\r\nassure you we have infamous tools to work with[373].’ Exactly the same\r\nimpression is produced by a study of the dispatches of Lord William\r\nBentinck, our military representative at Madrid, and of the diary of\r\nSir Charles Vaughan, who carefully attended and followed the debates\r\nof the Central Junta at Aranjuez. It was clear to any dispassionate\r\nobserver that time was being wasted, and that the best was not being\r\ndone with the available material.\r\n\r\n  [370] Napier is not quite correct in saying (i. 293) that ‘Leon\r\n  never raised a single soldier for the cause.’ It had three\r\n  battalions of volunteers (2,400 men) at Rio Seco, and raised\r\n  four more at Leon, Zamora, Ledesma, and Benavente in September\r\n  (_Madrid Gazette_, Sept. 28). But this was a poor contribution\r\n  for a kingdom of four provinces and 620,000 souls.\r\n\r\n  [371] I see no proof that even this was done. There were only\r\n  five of them, the _Provinciales_ of Cuenca, Toledo, Ciudad Real,\r\n  Alcazar de Don Juan, and Siguenza. Toledo and Alcazar had 579\r\n  and 595 under arms at the time of Baylen, and only 500 each,\r\n  apparently, in Nov. 1808. See Arteche, iii. 496.\r\n\r\n  [372] For the Asturians see the table in Arteche (ii. 651):\r\n  they were still 10,000 strong after having shared in Blake’s\r\n  disastrous campaign. For the Estremadurans compare the list of\r\n  regiments raised in the _Madrid Gazette_ of Oct. 21, giving\r\n  a total of 23,600 men, with the actual morning state of the\r\n  Estremaduran troops at Madrid on their way to Burgos, 12,846 in\r\n  all, given in Arteche (iii. 477).\r\n\r\n  [373] Stuart to Moore, from Madrid, Oct. 18, 1808.\r\n\r\nThis was all the more inexcusable because the nation was thoroughly\r\nin earnest, and prepared to make any sacrifices. The voluntary\r\ncontributions made both by provinces and by individuals were astounding\r\nwhen the poverty of Spain is taken into consideration[374]. It was\r\nthe energy and will to use them on the part of the leaders that was\r\nwanting. Moreover, England was pouring in supplies of all sorts: before\r\nNovember 16 she had sent at least 122,000 muskets and other military\r\nequipment of all kinds to the value of several hundred thousand pounds.\r\nBefore the same date she had forwarded 4,725,000 dollars in hard\r\ncash[375], and Mr. Frere, the newly appointed minister, brought another\r\nmillion to Corunna.\r\n\r\n  [374] For details see the tables in Arguelles, and the grants\r\n  recorded in the _Madrid Gazette_ for September, October, and\r\n  November.\r\n\r\n  [375] I take these figures as to what had been actually received\r\n  from Vaughan, who was at Madrid, in constant communication with\r\n  Stuart and Bentinck. They represent what had been paid over and\r\n  acknowledged, not what had been promised or provided, and may be\r\n  taken as accurate.\r\n\r\nInstead of utilizing every possible resource the government went on\r\ndebating about things unessential, as if the war had been ended at\r\nBaylen. It would neither conduct the new campaign itself, nor appoint\r\na single commander-in-chief to conduct it in its behalf. With absolute\r\ntruth Colonel Graham wrote from the head quarters of the Army of the\r\nCentre that ‘the miserable system established by the Junta was at the\r\nbottom of all misfortunes. I pitied poor Castaños and poor Spain, and\r\ncame away disgusted to the greatest degree[376].’\r\n\r\n  [376] Graham to Moore, from Tudela, Nov. 9, 1808.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI: CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nAN EPISODE IN THE BALTIC\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that one of Napoleon’s preliminary measures, in\r\nhis long campaign against the freedom of Spain, had been the removal of\r\nthe flower of her army to the shores of the Baltic. In the spring of\r\n1807 the Marquis of La Romana, with fourteen battalions of infantry and\r\nfive regiments of cavalry, all completed to war strength, had marched\r\nfor Hamburg. After wintering in the Hanseatic towns, Mecklenburg, and\r\nSwedish Pomerania, this corps had been moved up early in 1808 into\r\nDenmark[377]. It is clear that there was no military object in placing\r\nit there. The Danish fleet was gone, carried off by Lord Cathcart’s\r\nexpedition in the previous September, and there was no probability\r\nthat the English would return for a second visit, when they had\r\ncompletely executed their plan for destroying the naval resources of\r\nDenmark. France and Sweden, it is true, were still at war, but King\r\nGustavus was so much occupied by the defensive struggle against the\r\nRussians in Finland, that it was unlikely that he would detach troops\r\nfor an objectless expedition against the Danes. On the other hand the\r\nAnglo-Swedish fleet was so completely dominant in the Baltic and the\r\nSound, that there was no possibility of launching an expedition from\r\nDenmark against Southern Sweden. Even between the various islands at\r\nthe mouth of the Baltic, where the water-distances are very short,\r\ntroops could only be moved at night, and with infinite precautions\r\nagainst being surprised on the passage by English frigates. Gothenburg\r\nand the other harbours of South-western Sweden served as convenient\r\nports of call to the British squadron told off for the observation\r\nof the Cattegat, the two Belts, and the Sound. Nothing could be done\r\nagainst Sweden, unless indeed a frost of exceptional severity might\r\nclose the waterway between Zealand and Scania. Even then an attempt to\r\nmake a dash at Helsingborg or Malmö would involve so many difficulties\r\nand dangers that few generals would have cared to risk it.\r\n\r\n  [377] The Spanish troops, though the best of the whole army, do\r\n  not seem to have much impressed the German observer with their\r\n  discipline. See the Mecklenburger Von Suckow’s observations on\r\n  what he saw of them in his _From Jena to Moscow_, p. 92.\r\n\r\nLa Romana’s corps formed part of an army under Marshal Bernadotte,\r\nwhose sphere of command extended all over the south-western shores of\r\nthe Baltic, and whose head quarters were sometimes at Schleswig and\r\nsometimes at Lübeck or Stralsund. He had considerable French and Dutch\r\ncontingents, but the bulk of his force consisted of 30,000 Danes. In\r\npreparation for Napoleon’s scheme against the Spanish Bourbons, La\r\nRomana’s forces had been carefully scattered between Jutland and the\r\nDanish Isles, so that there was no large central body concentrated\r\nunder the Marquis’s own hand. The garrisons of the Spanish regiments\r\nwere interspersed between those of Danish troops, so that it would be\r\ndifficult to get them together. In March, 1808, when the Emperor had at\r\nlast shown his hand by the treacherous seizure of Pampeluna, Barcelona,\r\nand Figueras, the troops of La Romana were cantoned as follows. Six\r\nbattalions were in the island of Zealand, mainly in and about the old\r\nroyal residence of Roeskilde[378]. Four battalions and two cavalry\r\nregiments were in Fünen, the central island of the Danish group, and\r\nwith them La Romana himself, whose head quarters were at Nyborg[379].\r\nOne battalion lay in the island of Langeland, close to the south coast\r\nof Fünen[380]. In the mainland of Jutland were three cavalry regiments\r\nand three battalions of infantry[381], quartered in the little towns\r\nat the southern end of the Cattegat--Fredericia, Aarhuus, and Randers.\r\nIn Zealand the 4,000 Spaniards were under the eyes of the main Danish\r\narmy of observation against Sweden. In Fünen La Romana’s 4,500 horse\r\nand foot were cantoned in small detachments, while a solid body of\r\n3,000 Danes garrisoned Odense in the centre of the island, separating\r\nthe Spanish regiments one from another. In Langeland, along with the\r\nCatalonian light battalion, were a company of French grenadiers and\r\nabout 800 Danes. The troops in Jutland were mixed up with a brigade of\r\nDutch light cavalry and some Danish infantry. Napoleon’s own provident\r\neye had been roving round Denmark, and he had himself given the orders\r\nfor the dislocation of the Spanish corps in the fashion that seemed\r\nbest calculated to make any common action impossible. To keep them\r\nin good temper he had recently raised the pay of the officers, and\r\nannounced his intention of decorating La Romana with the Grand Cross of\r\nthe Legion of Honour. Bernadotte, by his desire, displayed the greatest\r\nconfidence in his auxiliaries, and took a troop of the cavalry regiment\r\nDel Rey as his personal escort while moving about in Denmark[382].\r\n\r\n  [378] Infantry regiments of Guadalajara and Asturias, of three\r\n  battalions each.\r\n\r\n  [379] Infantry regiment of Princesa (three battalions), light\r\n  battalion of Barcelona, and cavalry regiments of Almanza and\r\n  Villaviciosa.\r\n\r\n  [380] Light battalion of ‘Volunteers of Catalonia.’\r\n\r\n  [381] Infantry regiment of Zamora, cavalry regiments Del Rey,\r\n  Algarve, Infante.\r\n\r\n  [382] Arteche, iii. 151.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this, the Marquis and his officers began to grow uneasy\r\nin April, 1808, for the stream of dispatches and letters from Spain,\r\nwhich had been reaching them very regularly during the winter, began\r\nto dry up in the spring. When the first communication from the new\r\nministry of Ferdinand VII reached La Romana he found that it contained\r\na complaint that the home government had received no reports from the\r\nexpeditionary force since January, and that fifteen separate dispatches\r\nsent to him from Madrid had failed to get any answer. The fact was\r\nthat Napoleon had been systematically intercepting every document\r\nwhich the war minister at one end of the line, and the Marquis at the\r\nother, had been committing to the French post[383]. The last dispatch\r\nhad only come to hand because such an important announcement as that\r\nof the accession of King Ferdinand had been sent by the hands of a\r\nSpanish officer, whom Bonaparte or Fouché had not thought proper to\r\narrest, though they had intercepted so much official correspondence.\r\nThe Emperor himself had sent orders to Bernadotte that the news of the\r\nrevolution at Aranjuez should be kept as long as possible from the\r\nMarquis and his troops[384]: and so it came to pass that only a very\r\nfew days after the events of March 19 became known in Denmark, there\r\nfollowed the deplorable intelligence of the treachery of Bayonne and\r\nof the Madrid insurrection of May 2. These tidings produced the same\r\nfeelings in Nyborg and Fredericia that they had caused at Seville\r\nor Corunna. But on the shores of the Baltic, further north than any\r\nSpanish troops had ever been before, the expeditionary corps felt\r\nitself helpless and surrounded by enemies. Yet as Joseph O’Donnell,\r\nthen one of La Romana’s staff, observed: ‘The more they tried to\r\npersuade us that Spain was tranquil, and had settled down to enjoy\r\nan age of felicity under Napoleon, the more clearly did we foresee\r\nthe scenes of blood, strife, and disaster which were to follow these\r\nincredible events[385].’\r\n\r\n  [383] Bourrienne, _Mémoires_, viii. 20.\r\n\r\n  [384] Napoleon to Berthier, March 29, 1808 (_Nap. Corresp._,\r\n  13,699).\r\n\r\n  [385] See his words quoted in Arteche, iii. 154.\r\n\r\nOn June 24 there reached Nyborg the intelligence which showed the whole\r\nof Napoleon’s schemes completed: it was announced to La Romana that\r\nJoseph Bonaparte had been proclaimed King of Spain, and he was ordered\r\nto transmit the news to his troops, and to inform them in General\r\nOrders that they were now serving a new master. The only commentary on\r\nthis astonishing information which the Spanish officers could procure\r\nconsisted of the nauseous banalities of the _Moniteur_ concerning the\r\n‘regeneration of Spain.’\r\n\r\nA very few days later the first ray of hope shone upon the humbled\r\nand disheartened general. One of the earliest ideas of the British\r\nGovernment, on hearing of the Spanish insurrection, had been to open\r\ncommunications with the troops in Denmark. Castaños, in his first\r\ninterview with the Governor of Gibraltar, had expressed his opinion\r\nthat they would strike a blow for liberty if only they were given the\r\nchance. The fleet of Sir Richard Keates so completely commanded the\r\nBaltic that it would be possible to rescue the Spanish expeditionary\r\nforce, if only it were willing and able to cut its way to the coast.\r\nBut it was necessary to find out whether the Marquis was ready to risk\r\nhis neck in such an enterprise, and whether he could depend on the\r\nloyalty of his troops.\r\n\r\nTo settle this all-important question some agent must be found who\r\nwould undertake to penetrate to La Romana’s head quarters, a task\r\nof the most uninviting kind, for it was quite uncertain whether the\r\nSpaniard would eagerly join in the plan, or whether he would make up\r\nhis mind to espouse the cause of Napoleon, and hand over his visitor to\r\nthe French police. To find a man who knew the Continent well enough to\r\nmove about without detection, and who would take the risk of placing\r\nhimself at La Romana’s mercy, in case his offers were refused, did\r\nnot seem easy. But the right person was pitched upon by Sir Arthur\r\nWellesley just before he sailed for Portugal. He recommended to\r\nCanning a Roman Catholic priest of the name of James Robertson. This\r\nenterprising ecclesiastic was a Scot who had spent most of his life\r\nin a monastery at Ratisbon, but had lately come to England and was\r\nacting as tutor in the house of an English Catholic peer. He had some\r\ntime before offered himself to Wellesley as a man who knew Germany\r\nwell, and was prepared to run risks in making himself useful to the\r\nGovernment[386].\r\n\r\n  [386] See his interesting little book, _A Secret Mission to the\r\n  Danish Isles in 1808_, published at Edinburgh in 1863 by his\r\n  relative Alexander Fraser.\r\n\r\nUnder the belief that the Spaniards were still quartered in the Hanse\r\ntowns and Holstein, Canning sent for Robertson and asked him whether\r\nhe would undertake this dangerous mission to Northern Germany. The\r\npriest accepted the offer, and was dispatched to Heligoland, where\r\nMr. Mackenzie, the British agent in this lately seized island, found\r\nhim a place on board a smuggling vessel bound for the mouth of the\r\nWeser. He was safely landed near Bremerhafen and made his way to\r\nHamburg, only to find that the Spaniards had been moved northward into\r\nthe Danish isles. This made the mission more dangerous, as Robertson\r\nknew neither the country nor the language. But he disguised himself\r\nas a German commercial traveller, and laid in a stock of chocolate\r\nand cigars--things which were very rare in the North, as along with\r\nother colonial produce they were proscribed by the Continental System,\r\nand could only be got from smugglers. It was known that the Spanish\r\nofficers felt deeply their privation of the two luxuries most dear to\r\ntheir frugal race, so that it seemed very natural that a dealer in such\r\ngoods should attempt to find a market among them.\r\n\r\nGetting to Nyborg without much difficulty, the priest took his fate in\r\nhis hands, and introduced himself to La Romana with a box of cigars\r\nunder one arm and a dozen packets of chocolate under the other.\r\nWhen they were alone, he threw himself on the Marquis’s confidence,\r\nowning that he was a priest and a British subject, not a German or a\r\ncommercial traveller. The Spaniard was at first suspicious and silent,\r\nthinking that he had to deal with an _agent provocateur_ of the French\r\nGovernment, who was trying to make him show his hand. Robertson\r\nhad no written vouchers for his mission--they would have been too\r\ndangerous--but had been given some verbal credentials by Canning, which\r\nsoon convinced La Romana of his good faith. The Marquis then owned that\r\nhe was disgusted with his position, and felt sure that Napoleon had\r\nplotted the ruin of Spain, though what exactly had happened at Bayonne\r\nhe had not yet been able to ascertain. Robertson next laid before him\r\nCanning’s offer--that if the expeditionary force could be concentrated\r\nand got to the coast, the Baltic fleet should pick it up, and see that\r\nit was landed at Minorca, Gibraltar, the Canaries, in South America, or\r\nat any point in Spain that the Marquis might select.\r\n\r\nLa Romana asked for a night to talk the matter over with his staff,\r\nand next day gave his full consent to the plan, bidding the priest\r\npass the word on to Sir Richard Keates, and discover the earliest day\r\non which transports could be got ready to carry off his men. Robertson\r\ntried to communicate with a British frigate which was hovering off the\r\ncoast of Fünen, but was arrested by Danish militiamen while signalling\r\nto the ship from a lonely point on the beach. His purpose was almost\r\ndiscovered, and he only escaped by a series of ingenious lies to the\r\nmilitia colonel before whom he was taken by his captors. Moving further\r\nsouth, he again tried to get in touch with Sir Richard Keates, and\r\nthis time succeeded. The news was passed to London, and transports\r\nwere prepared for the deliverance of the Spaniards. Canning also sent\r\nto Fünen an agent of the Asturian Junta, who would be able to give his\r\ncountrymen full news of the insurrection that had taken place in June.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile La Romana had sounded his subordinates, and found them\r\nall eager to join in the plan of evasion, save Kindelan, the\r\nbrigadier-general commanding the troops in Jutland, who showed such\r\nunpatriotic views that the officer sent to confer with him dropped the\r\ntopic without revealing his commission. The plan which the Marquis\r\nhad formed was rather ingenious: Bernadotte was about to go round the\r\ngarrisons in his command on a tour of inspection. It was agreed that\r\nunder the pretext of holding a grand field-day for his benefit, all the\r\nscattered Spanish troops in Fünen should be concentrated at Nyborg. The\r\nregiments in Zealand and Jutland were to join them, when the arrival of\r\nthe British fleet should be reported, by seizing the Danish small craft\r\nin the harbours nearest to them, and crossing over the two Belts to\r\njoin their commander.\r\n\r\nAn unfortunate _contretemps_, however, interfered to prevent the full\r\nexecution of the scheme. Orders came from Paris that all the Spanish\r\ntroops were to swear allegiance to Joseph Bonaparte, each corps\r\nparading at its head quarters for the purpose on July 30 or 31. This\r\nnews caused grave disorders among the subordinate officers and the men,\r\nwho were of course in complete ignorance of the plan for evasion. La\r\nRomana and his councillors held that the ceremony had better be gone\r\nthrough--to swear under compulsion was not perjury, and to refuse\r\nwould draw down on the Spanish corps overwhelming numbers of Danes and\r\nFrench, so that the whole scheme for escape would miscarry. Accordingly\r\nthe troops in Jutland and Fünen went through the ceremony in a more or\r\nless farcical way--in some cases the men are said to have substituted\r\nthe name Ferdinand for the name Joseph in their oath, while the\r\nofficers took no notice of this rather startling variation.\r\n\r\nBut in Zealand things went otherwise: the two infantry regiments of\r\nGuadalajara and Asturias, when paraded and told to take the oath,\r\nburst out into mutiny, drove off those of their own officers who\r\ntried to restrain them, killed the aide-de-camp of the French General\r\nFririon, who was presiding at the ceremony, and threatened to march on\r\nCopenhagen. Next day they were surrounded by masses of Danish troops,\r\nforced to surrender, disarmed, and put in confinement in small bodies\r\nat various points in the island [August 1].\r\n\r\nThis startling news revealed to Bernadotte the true state of feeling\r\nin the Spanish army, and he wrote to La Romana to announce that he was\r\nabout to visit the Danish Isles in order to inquire into the matter.\r\nFortunately there came at the same moment news from England that the\r\ntime for escape was at hand. On August 4, only three days after the\r\nmutiny at Roeskilde, the brigantine _Mosquito_, having on board Rafael\r\nLobo (the emissary of the Asturian deputies), reached the Baltic, and\r\ncommunicated by night with some of the Spanish officers on the island\r\nof Langeland. The British fleet had sailed, and the time for action had\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nAccordingly La Romana gave the word to the officers in each garrison to\r\nwhom the secret had been entrusted. On August 7, the troops in Fünen\r\nconcentrated, and seized the port of Nyborg: the Danes were completely\r\ntaken by surprise, and no resistance was made save by a gallant and\r\nobstinate naval officer commanding a brig in the harbour. He fired on\r\nthe Spaniards, and would not yield till an English frigate and five\r\ngunboats ran into the port and battered his vessel to pieces.\r\n\r\nOn August 8 the troops in Jutland struck their blow: the infantry\r\nregiment of Zamora at Fredericia seized a number of fishing-vessels,\r\nand ferried itself over into Fünen with no difficulty. General\r\nKindelan, the only traitor in the camp, had been kept from all\r\nknowledge of what was to happen: when he saw his troops on the\r\nmove, and received an explanatory note from La Romana putting him\r\nin possession of the state of affairs, he feigned compliance in the\r\nplan, but disguised himself and fled to the nearest French cantonment,\r\nwhere he gave enemy a full account of the startling news. The cavalry\r\nregiments Infante and Del Rey had the same luck as their comrades of\r\nZamora: they seized boats at Aarhuus, and, abandoning their horses, got\r\nacross unopposed to Fünen. Their comrades of the regiment of Algarve\r\nwere less lucky: they were delayed for some time by the indecision of\r\ntheir aged and imbecile colonel: when Costa, their senior captain, took\r\ncommand and marched them from Horsens towards the port of Fredericia,\r\nit was now too late. A brigade of Dutch Hussars, warned by Kindelan,\r\nbeset them on the way and took them all prisoners. Costa, seeing that\r\nthe responsibility would fall on his head, blew out his brains at the\r\nmoment of surrender.\r\n\r\nRomana had concentrated in Fünen nearly 8,000 men, and was so strong\r\nthat the Danish general at Odense, in the centre of the island, dared\r\nnot meddle with him. On August 9, 10, and 11 he passed his troops over\r\nto the smaller island of Langeland, where the regiment of Catalonia had\r\nalready disarmed the Danish garrison and seized the batteries. Here he\r\nwas safe, for Langeland was far out to sea, and he was now protected\r\nfrom the Danes by the English warships which were beginning to gather\r\non the spot. A few isolated men from Zealand, about 150 in all,\r\nsucceeded in joining the main body, having escaped from their guards\r\nand seized fishing-boats: but these were all that got away from the\r\nregiments of Asturias and Guadalajara, the mutineers of July 31.\r\n\r\nFor ten days Langeland was crammed with 9,000 Spanish troops, waiting\r\nanxiously for the expected British squadron. On the twenty-first,\r\nhowever, Admiral Keates appeared, with three sail of the line and\r\nseveral smaller craft. On these and on small Danish vessels the whole\r\narmy was hastily embarked: they reached Gothenburg in Sweden on August\r\n27, and found there thirty-seven large transports sent from England\r\nfor their accommodation. After a long voyage they reached the Spanish\r\ncoast in safety, and the whole expeditionary corps of the North, now\r\n9,000 strong, was concentrated at Santander by October 11. The infantry\r\nwas sent to take part in the second campaign of General Blake. The\r\ndismounted cavalry were ordered to move to Estremadura, and there to\r\nprovide themselves with horses. La Romana himself was called to Madrid\r\nto interview the Junta, so that his troops went to the front under the\r\ncharge of his second in command, the Count of San Roman, to take part\r\nin the bloody fight of Espinosa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON’S INVASION OF SPAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nFRENCH AND SPANISH PREPARATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Supreme Junta was expending its energy on discussing\r\nthe relative merits of benevolent despotism and representative\r\ngovernment, and while Castaños fretted and fumed for the moving up\r\nof reinforcements that never arrived, the French Emperor was getting\r\nready to strike. It took many weeks for the veteran divisions from\r\nGlogau and Erfurt, from Bayreuth and Berlin, to traverse the whole\r\nbreadth of the French Empire and reach the Pyrenees. While they were\r\ntrailing across the Rhineland and the plains of France, well fêted and\r\nfed at every important town[387], their master employed the time of\r\nwaiting in strengthening his political hold on Central Europe. We have\r\nseen that he was seriously alarmed at the possibility of an Austrian\r\nwar, and alluded to it in his confidential letters to his kinsfolk.\r\nBut the court of Vienna was slow to stir, and as August and September\r\nslipped by without any definite move on the Danube, Bonaparte began\r\nto hope that he was to be spared the dangerous problem of waging two\r\nEuropean wars at the same time. Meanwhile he assumed an arrogant and\r\nblustering tone with the Austrian Government, warning them that though\r\nhe was withdrawing 100,000 men from Germany, he should replace them\r\nwith new levies, and was still strong enough to hold his own[388].\r\nMetternich gave prudent and evasive answers, and no immediate signs\r\nof a rupture could be discerned. But to make matters sure, the Emperor\r\nhastened to invite his ally the Emperor Alexander of Russia to meet\r\nhim at Erfurt. The ostensible object of the conference was to make\r\na final effort to induce the British Government to accept terms of\r\npeace. Its real meaning was that Bonaparte wished to reassure himself\r\nconcerning the Czar’s intentions, and to see whether he could rely\r\nupon the support of Russia in the event of a new Austrian war. There\r\nis no need to go into the details of the meeting (September 27 to\r\nOctober 14), of the gathering of four vassal kings and a score of\r\nminor princes of the Confederation of the Rhine to do homage to their\r\nmaster, of the feasts and plays and reviews. Suffice it to say that\r\nNapoleon got what he wanted, a definite promise from the Czar of an\r\noffensive and defensive alliance against all enemies whatsoever: a\r\nspecial mention of Austria was made in the tenth clause of the new\r\ntreaty[389]. In return Alexander obtained leave to carry out his\r\ndesigns against Finland and the Danubian principalities: his ally was\r\nonly too glad to see him involved in any enterprise that would distract\r\nhis attention from Central Europe. The Emperor Francis II hastened to\r\ndisarm the suspicions of Napoleon by sending to Erfurt an envoy[390]\r\ncharged with all manner of pacific declarations: they were accepted,\r\nbut the acceptance was accompanied by a message of scarcely concealed\r\nthreats[391], which must have touched the court of Vienna to the quick.\r\nStrong in his Russian alliance, Bonaparte chose rather to bully than to\r\ncajole the prince who, by the strangest of chances, was destined within\r\neighteen months to become his father-in-law. The quiet reception given\r\nto his hectoring dispatches showed that, for the present at least,\r\nnothing need be feared from the side of Austria. The Emperor’s whole\r\nattention could be turned towards Spain. After telling off a few more\r\nregiments for service beyond the Pyrenees, and giving leave to the\r\nprinces of the Confederation of the Rhine to demobilize their armies,\r\nhe left Erfurt [October 14] and came rushing back across Germany and\r\nFrance to Paris; he stayed there ten days and then started for Bayonne,\r\nwhere he arrived on the twentieth day after the termination of the\r\nconference [November 3].\r\n\r\n  [387] For the banquets given (under imperial orders) by the\r\n  cities, see _Nap. Corresp._, 14,291, 14,331. Clearly Napoleon I\r\n  understood the ‘policy of champagne and sausages’ as well as his\r\n  nephew.\r\n\r\n  [388] Considering the delicate nature of the political situation,\r\n  Napoleon’s language to the Austrians was most rude and\r\n  provocative. See the long interview with Metternich [Aug. 15]\r\n  reported by Champagny in his dispatch (_Nap. Corresp._, 14,254):\r\n  ‘Vous avez levé 400,000 hommes: je vais en lever 200,000. La\r\n  Confédération du Rhin, qui avait renvoyé ses troupes, va les\r\n  réunir et faire des levées. Je rétablirai les places de Silésie,\r\n  au lieu d’évacuer cette province et les états Prussiens, comme\r\n  je me le proposais. L’Europe sera sur pied, et le plus léger\r\n  incident amènera le commencement des hostilités,’ &c.\r\n\r\n  [389] ‘Dans le cas où l’Autriche se mettrait en guerre contre\r\n  la France, l’Empereur de Russie s’engage à se déclarer contre\r\n  l’Autriche, et à faire cause commune avec la France’ (Article X,\r\n  clause 2, of the Secret Treaty).\r\n\r\n  [390] Baron Vincent.\r\n\r\n  [391] See the dispatch (_Nap. Corresp._, 14,380).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the ostensible purpose of that meeting had been carried out,\r\nby the forwarding to the King of England of a joint note in which\r\nFrance and Russia offered him peace on the basis of _Uti Possidetis_.\r\nIt was a vague and grandiloquent document, obviously intended for\r\nthe eye of the public rather than for that of the old King. The two\r\nEmperors expatiated on the horrors of war and on the vast changes\r\nmade of late in the map of Europe. Unless peace were made ‘there\r\nmight be greater changes still, and all to the disadvantage of the\r\nEnglish nation.’ The Continental System was working untold misery, and\r\nthe cessation of hostilities would be equally advantageous to Great\r\nBritain and to her enemies. King George should ‘listen to the voice\r\nof humanity,’ and assure the happiness of Europe by consenting to a\r\ngeneral pacification.\r\n\r\nThough well aware of the hollowness of these protestations, which were\r\nonly intended to throw on England the odium of continuing the war,\r\nthe British Cabinet took them into serious consideration. The replies\r\nto the two powers were carefully kept separate, and were written, not\r\nin the name of the King (for the personal appeal to him was merely\r\na theatrical device), but in that of the ministry. To Russia a very\r\npolite answer was returned, but the question on which the possibility\r\nof peace rested was brought straight to the front. Would France\r\nacknowledge the existing government of Spain as a power with which she\r\nwas prepared to treat? Canning, who drafted the dispatch, was perfectly\r\nwell aware that nothing was further from the Emperor’s thoughts, and\r\ncould not keep himself from adding an ironical clause, to the effect\r\nthat Napoleon had so often spoken of late of his regard for the dignity\r\nand welfare of the Spanish people, that it could not be doubted that he\r\nwould consent. The late transactions at Bayonne, ‘whose principles were\r\nas unjust as their example was dangerous to all legitimate sovereigns,’\r\nmust clearly have been carried through without his concurrence or\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\nThe reply to France was still more uncompromising. ‘The King,’ it\r\nsaid, ‘was desirous for peace on honourable terms. The miserable\r\ncondition of the Continent, to which allusion had been made, was not\r\ndue to his policy: a system devised for the destruction of British\r\ncommerce had recoiled on its authors and their instruments.’ But the\r\ndistress even of his enemies was no source of pleasure to the King, and\r\nhe would treat at once, if the representatives of Sweden, Portugal,\r\nSicily, and Spain were admitted to take part in the negotiations. It\r\nwas to be specially stipulated that the ‘Central Junta of Government’\r\nat Madrid was to be a party to any treaty of peace.\r\n\r\nThe two British notes brought the replies from St. Petersburg and Paris\r\nthat Canning expected. Count Romanzoff, writing for the Czar, could\r\nonly state that his master had acknowledged Joseph Bonaparte as King\r\nof Spain, and could not recognize the existence of any other legal\r\nauthority in that kingdom. But if this point (the only really important\r\none) could be got over, the Russian Government was ready to treat on a\r\nbasis of _Uti Possidetis_, or any other just and honourable terms. The\r\nFrench reply was, as was natural, couched in very different language.\r\nNapoleon had been irritated by Canning’s sarcastic allusions to the\r\nfailure of the Continental System: he thought the tone of the British\r\nnote most improper and insulting--‘it comes from the same pen which the\r\nEnglish ministry employs to fabricate the swarm of libels with which it\r\ninundates the Continent. Such language is despicable, and unworthy of\r\nthe imperial attention[392].’\r\n\r\n  [392] Napoleon to Champagny (_Nap. Corresp._, 14,643).\r\n\r\nConsidering the offensive and bullying tone which Bonaparte was wont\r\nto use to other powers--his note written to Austria a few days before\r\nwas a fair example of it--he had little reason to be indignant at the\r\nepigrams of the English minister. Yet the latter might perhaps have\r\ndone well to keep his pen under control, and to forget that he was not\r\nwriting for the _Anti-Jacobin_, but composing an official document.\r\nEven though Napoleon’s offer was hollow and insincere, it should have\r\nbeen met with dry courtesy rather than with humorous irony.\r\n\r\nOf course Bonaparte refused to treat the Spaniards as a free and equal\r\nbelligerent power. He had declared his brother King of Spain, and had\r\nnow reached that pitch of blind autolatry in which he regarded his own\r\nfiat as the sole source of legality. In common honour England could\r\nnot abandon the insurgents; for the Emperor to allow his brother’s\r\nclaim to be ignored was equally impossible. In his present state of\r\nmind he would have regarded such a concession to the enemy as an\r\nacknowledgement of disgraceful defeat. It was obvious that the war must\r\ngo on, and when the Emperor suggested that England might treat with him\r\nwithout stipulating for the admission of the Junta as a party to the\r\nnegotiations[393], he must have been perfectly well aware that he was\r\nproposing a dishonourable move which the ministry of Portland could not\r\npossibly make. His suggestions as to a separate treaty with England on\r\nthe basis of _Uti Possidetis_ were futile: he intended that they should\r\nbe declined, and declined they were. But he had succeeded in his end\r\nof posing before the French nation and the European powers as a lover\r\nof peace, foiled in his devices by the unbending arrogance of Great\r\nBritain. This was all that he had desired, and so far his machinations\r\nattained their object[394].\r\n\r\n  [393] Napoleon to Champagny (_Nap. Corresp._, 14,643).\r\n\r\n  [394] It is strange to find that Napier was convinced that\r\n  Napoleon had a real desire for peace, and hoped to secure it by\r\n  the proposals of October, 1808. He writes (i. 210): ‘The English\r\n  ministers asserted that the whole proceeding was an artifice\r\n  to sow distrust among his enemies. Yet what enemies were they\r\n  among whom he could create this uneasy feeling? Sweden, Sicily,\r\n  Portugal! the notion as applied to them was absurd; it is more\r\n  probable that he was sincere. He said so at St. Helena, and the\r\n  circumstances of the period warrant a belief in that assertion.’\r\n  But Napier has failed to see that the design was not to ‘sow\r\n  distrust among his enemies.’ The whole business was intended\r\n  to influence French public opinion, and in a secondary way the\r\n  public opinion of all Europe. Bonaparte wished to pose as a\r\n  friend of peace, and to bestow on England the unenviable rôle of\r\n  the selfish fomenter of wars. With many simple folk in France and\r\n  elsewhere he succeeded, but no Englishman, save one blinded by a\r\n  dislike for everything Tory, could have been deceived.\r\n\r\nLong before the English replies had been sent off to Champagny and\r\nRomanzoff, the much-delayed campaign on the Ebro had commenced. All\r\nthrough the months of August and September the French had behaved as if\r\ntheir adversaries were acting on proper military principles, and might\r\nbe expected to throw their whole force on the true objective point.\r\nJourdan and his colleagues had no reason to foresee that the Spanish\r\nGovernment would launch out into the hideous series of blunders which,\r\nas a matter of fact, were committed. That no commander-in-chief would\r\nbe appointed, that the victorious troops of Baylen would be held back\r\nfor weeks in Andalusia, that no strenuous effort would be made to raise\r\nnew armies in Leon and the two Castiles, were chances that seemed so\r\nimprobable that King Joseph and his advisers did not take them into\r\nconsideration. They expected that the Spaniards would mass the armies\r\nof Andalusia, Estremadura, Castile, and Aragon, and endeavour to turn\r\ntheir left flank on the side of Sanguesa and Pampeluna, or that (the\r\nother rational course) they would send the Asturians, the Andalusians,\r\nand the Castilians to join Blake, and debouch down the line of the\r\nUpper Ebro, from Reynosa on to Vittoria and Miranda. In the first case\r\n70,000, and in the latter case 80,000 men would be flung against one\r\nflank of the French position, and it would be necessary to concentrate\r\nin hot haste in order to hold them back. But, as a matter of fact,\r\nthe Spanish forces did not even come up to the front for many weeks,\r\nand when they did appear it was, as we have seen, not in the form of\r\none great army concentrated for a stroke on a single point, but as a\r\nnumber of weak and isolated columns, each threatening a different part\r\nof the long line that lay along the Ebro from Miranda to Milagro. When\r\nfeeble demonstrations were made against so many separate sections of\r\nhis front, Jourdan supposed that they were skilful feints, intended\r\nto cover some serious attack on a weak spot, and acted accordingly,\r\nholding back till the enemy should develop his real plan, and refusing\r\nto commit himself meanwhile to offensive operations on a serious scale.\r\nIt must be confessed that the chaotic and inconsequent movements of\r\nthe Spaniards bore, to the eye of the observer from the outside,\r\nsomething like the appearance of a deep plan. On August 27 the Conde\r\nde Montijo, with a column of the Aragonese army, felt his way up the\r\nEbro as far as the bridge of Alfaro, nearly opposite the extreme left\r\nflank of the French at Milagro. When attacked by Lefebvre-Desnouettes\r\nat the head of a few cavalry and a horse-battery, the Spanish general\r\nrefused to stand, and retreated on Tudela. Marshal Moncey then pressed\r\nhim with an infantry division, but Montijo again gave back. The French\r\nthought that this move must be a mere diversion, intended to attract\r\ntheir attention to the side of Aragon, for Montijo had acted with such\r\nextreme feebleness that it was unnatural to suppose that he was making\r\nanything but a feint. They were quite wrong however: Palafox had told\r\nthe count to push as far up the Ebro as he could, without any thought\r\nof favouring operations by Blake or Castaños, the former of whom was\r\nat this moment not far in front of Astorga, while the latter was still\r\nat Madrid. Montijo had given way simply because his troops were raw\r\nlevies, and because there were no supports behind him nearer than\r\nSaragossa. It was to no effect, therefore, that King Joseph, after the\r\nfighting in front of Alfaro and Tudela, moved his reserves up the river\r\nto Miranda, thinking that the real attack must be coming from that\r\nside. There was no real attack intended, for the enemy had not as yet\r\nbrought any considerable force up to the front.\r\n\r\nIt was not till nearly three weeks later that the Spaniards made\r\nanother offensive move. This time Blake was the assailant. On September\r\n10 he had at last concentrated the greater part of his army at\r\nReynosa--the centre of roads at the source of the Ebro, of which we\r\nhave already had to speak on several occasions. He had with him four\r\ndivisions of the army of Galicia, as well as a ‘vanguard brigade’ and a\r\n‘reserve brigade’ of picked troops from the same quarter. Close behind\r\nhim were 8,000 Asturians under General Acevedo. The whole came to\r\n32,000 men, but there were no more than 400 cavalry with the corps--a\r\nfact which made Blake very anxious to keep to the mountains and to\r\navoid the plains of Old Castile[395]. He had left behind him in Galicia\r\nand about Astorga more than 10,000 men of new levies, not yet fit to\r\ntake the field. There were also some 9,000 Asturians in similar case,\r\nheld back within the limits of their own principality[396].\r\n\r\n  [395] For the organization and state of Blake’s force, see the\r\n  Appendix.\r\n\r\n  [396] The Asturias had raised nineteen new battalions: of these\r\n  eight went forward with Blake, and eleven remained behind.\r\n\r\nIn the elaborate plan of operations which had been sketched out at\r\nMadrid on September 5, it will be remembered that Blake’s army was\r\nintended to co-operate with those of Castaños and of Eguia. But he\r\npaid no attention whatever to the promises which his representative,\r\nInfantado, had made in his name, and executed an entirely different\r\nmovement: there was no commander-in-chief to compel him to act in\r\nunison with his colleagues. The Castilian and Estremaduran armies were\r\nnot ready, and Castaños had as yet only a feeble vanguard facing the\r\nenemy on the Central Ebro, his rear divisions being still far back,\r\non the road from Andalusia. Blake neither asked for nor received any\r\nassistance whatever from his colleagues, and set out in the most\r\nlight-hearted way to attack 70,000 French with his 32,000 Galicians and\r\nAsturians.\r\n\r\nHis plan was to threaten Burgos with a small portion of his army,\r\nwhile with the main body he marched on Bilbao, in order to rouse Biscay\r\nto a second revolt, and to turn the right flank of the French along the\r\nsea-shore. Accordingly he sent his ‘vanguard’ and ‘reserve’ brigades\r\ntowards Burgos, by the road that passes by Oña and Briviesca, while\r\nwith four complete divisions he moved on Bilbao. On the twentieth his\r\nleading column turned out of that town General Monthion, who was in\r\ngarrison there with a weak brigade of details and detachments.\r\n\r\nHere at last, as it seemed to Joseph Bonaparte and to Jourdan, was\r\nthe long-expected main attack of the Spaniards. Accordingly they\r\nconcentrated to their right, with the object of meeting it. Bessières\r\nevacuated Burgos and drew back to the line of the Upper Ebro. He there\r\nreplaced the King’s reserve, and the incomplete corps that was forming\r\nat Miranda and Vittoria under the command of Marshal Ney: thus these\r\ntroops became available for operations in Biscay. Ney, with two small\r\ninfantry divisions, marched on Bilbao by way of Durango: Joseph, with\r\nthe reserve, followed him. But when the Marshal reached the Biscayan\r\ncapital, the division of Blake’s army[397], which had occupied it for\r\nthe last six days, retired and took up a defensive attitude in the\r\nhills above Valmaceda, twenty miles to the west. Here it was joined by\r\na second division of the Galician army[398], and stood fast in a very\r\ndifficult country abounding in strong positions. Ney therefore held\r\nback, unwilling to attack a force that might be 30,000 strong (for\r\nall that he knew) with the 10,000 men that he had brought. Clearly he\r\nmust wait for King Joseph and the reserve, in case he should find that\r\nBlake’s whole army was in front of him.\r\n\r\n  [397] The 4th Galician Division under the Marquis of Portago.\r\n\r\n  [398] The 3rd Galician Division under General Riquelme.\r\n\r\nBut the King and his corps failed to appear: Bessières had sent to\r\ninform him that Blake, far from having moved his whole army on to\r\nBilbao, had still got the bulk of it in positions from which he could\r\nmarch down the Ebro and attack Miranda and Vittoria. This was to a\r\ncertain extent true, for the first and second divisions of the Galician\r\narmy were now at Villarcayo, on the southern side of the Cantabrian\r\nhills, a spot from which they could march either northward to Bilbao\r\nor eastward to Miranda. Moreover, Blake’s ‘reserve’ and ‘vanguard’\r\nbrigades were still about Frias and Oña, whither they had been pushed\r\nbefore the French evacuated Burgos. Bessières, therefore, had much to\r\nsay in favour of his view, that the point of danger was in the Ebro\r\nvalley and not in Biscay. King Joseph, convinced by his arguments,\r\nleft Ney unreinforced, and took post with the 6,000 men of the central\r\nreserve at Vittoria. His conclusion that Bilbao was not the true\r\nobjective of the Spaniards was soon confirmed by other movements of\r\nthe enemy. The feeble columns of Castaños were at last showing on the\r\nCentral Ebro, and Palafox was on the move on the side of Aragon.\r\n\r\nUnder the idea that all Blake’s Biscayan expedition had been no more\r\nthan a feint and a diversion, and that the real blow would be struck\r\non the Ebro, Jourdan and the King now directed Ney to come back from\r\nBilbao and to take up his old positions. The Marshal obeyed: leaving\r\nGeneral Merlin with 3,000 men in the Biscayan capital, he returned with\r\n7,000 bayonets to La Guardia, on the borders of Alava and Navarre. His\r\nold head quarters at Logroño, beyond the Ebro, had been occupied by the\r\nhead of one of Castaños’s columns. He did not attack this force, but\r\nmerely encamped opposite it, on the northern bank of the river [October\r\n5][399].\r\n\r\n  [399] All these moves are best described in Marshal Jourdan’s\r\n  _Mémoires_ (edited by Grouchy; Paris, 1899), pp. 71-5.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Part of Northern Spain.]\r\n\r\nIt is now time to review the position and forces of the Spanish\r\narmies, which were at last up in the fighting line. Blake’s 32,000\r\nAsturians[400] and Galicians were divided into two masses, at Valmaceda\r\nand Villarcayo, on the two sides of the Cantabrian hills. They were\r\nwithin three marches of each other, and the whole could be turned\r\neither against Biscay or against Vittoria, as the opportunity might\r\ndemand. But between Blake and the central divisions of the Spanish\r\narmy there was a vast gap. This, at a later period of the campaign,\r\nwas filled up by bringing forward the 12,000 men of the Estremaduran\r\narmy to Burgos: but this force, insufficient as it was for the purpose,\r\nhad not reached the front: in the middle of October it had not even\r\narrived at Madrid[401]. There seems to have been at Burgos nothing\r\nmore than a detached battalion or two, which had occupied the place\r\nwhen Bessières drew back towards the Ebro[402]. Of all the Spanish\r\nforces, the nearest organized corps on Blake’s right consisted of\r\nthe main body of this same army of Castile. This division, for it was\r\nno more, consisted of about 10,000 or 11,000 men: it contained a few\r\nregular corps (Regiment of Cantabria, a battalion of Grenadiers, the\r\nLeon Militia) which had been lent to it by the army of Andalusia, and\r\ntwelve raw Leonese and Castilian battalions, of the new levy which\r\nCuesta had raised. There were also some 800 cavalry with it. The\r\ncommander was now Pignatelli, for Eguia (who had originally been told\r\noff to the post) had fallen sick. This small and inefficient force was\r\nat Logroño on the Central Ebro, having taken possession of that place\r\nwhen it was evacuated by Marshal Ney in the last week of September.\r\nA little further down the river lay the 2nd Division of the army of\r\nAndalusia, which, under the orders of Coupigny, had taken a creditable\r\npart in the battle of Baylen. Released by the Junta of Seville in\r\nSeptember, it had at last gone forward and joined Castaños. But it was\r\nsomewhat changed in composition, for three of its original fourteen\r\nbattalions had been withdrawn[403] and sent to Catalonia, while three\r\nnew Andalusian corps had replaced them. Its commander was now General\r\nGrimarest, Coupigny having been told off to another sphere of duty. The\r\ndivision numbered about 6,000 bayonets, with 400 or 500 cavalry, and\r\na single battery. It occupied Lodosa, on the north bank of the Ebro,\r\nsome twelve miles down-stream from Logroño. Quite close to its right\r\nthere lay at Calahorra the 4th Division of the army of Andalusia, under\r\nLa Peña--a somewhat stronger force--about 7,500 foot, with 400 horse\r\nand two batteries. The only remaining division of Castaños’ ‘Army of\r\nthe Centre’ consisted of the Murcian and Valencian corps under Llamas.\r\nThis had entered Madrid 8,000 strong on August 13, but one of its\r\nregiments had been left behind at Aranjuez to guard the Junta. It now\r\nconsisted of no more than 7,000 men, and lay at Tudela, in close touch\r\nwith La Peña’s Andalusians. The total, therefore, of Castaños’ army\r\nin the second half of October did not amount to more than 31,000 foot\r\nand 3,000 horse. The 1st and 3rd divisions of the Andalusian army,\r\nlong detained beyond the Morena by the Junta of Seville, were but just\r\ncommencing to arrive at Madrid: of their 15,000 men less than half\r\nreached the front in November, in time to take their share in the\r\nrout of Tudela. Even these were not yet at Castaños’ disposition in\r\nOctober[404].\r\n\r\n  [400] Acevedo’s 8,000 Asturians joined Blake at Villarcayo on\r\n  Oct. 11 (see his dispatch in _Madrid Gazette_, Oct. 25).\r\n\r\n  [401] I gather from _Madrid Gazette_ (Oct. 21, p. 1,333) that it\r\n  was still organizing in and about Badajoz on Oct. 6, and did not\r\n  begin to march till later.\r\n\r\n  [402] Volunteers of Benavente from the army of Castile, and Tuy\r\n  Militia of Blake’s army.\r\n\r\n  [403] These three Granadan battalions had been sent, along with\r\n  the rest of the levies of that kingdom, to form part of the\r\n  division which Reding was leading to Catalonia. They had been\r\n  replaced by the new Andalusian battalions of Baylen, Navas de\r\n  Tolosa, and 5th of Seville.\r\n\r\n  [404] Castaños himself, in his exculpatory memoir, will not allow\r\n  that he ever had more than 26,000 men, even including the belated\r\n  troops of the 1st and 3rd Andalusian divisions which came up in\r\n  November.\r\n\r\nThe right wing of the Spanish army of the Ebro consisted of the raw\r\nand half-organized masses composing the army of Aragon. Palafox had\r\nsucceeded in getting together a great body of men from that loyal\r\nprovince, but he had not been able to form them into a force fit to\r\ntake the field. Owing to the way in which Aragon had been stripped\r\nof regular troops before the commencement of the war, there was no\r\nsolid body round which the new levies could be organized, and no\r\nsupply of trained officers to drill or discipline the thousands of\r\neager recruits. It would seem that in all no less than 32,000 were\r\nraised, but no force in any degree approaching these numbers took the\r\nfield. Every village and every mountain valley had contributed its\r\n_partida_ or its company, but with the best of wills Palafox had not\r\nyet succeeded in incorporating all these small and scattered units into\r\nregiments and brigades. Many of them had not even been armed: very few\r\nhad been properly clothed and equipped. Nevertheless no fewer than\r\nthirty-nine battalions in a state of greater or less organization were\r\nin existence by the end of October. They varied in strength to the most\r\nextraordinary degree: many were no more than 300 strong[405], one or\r\ntwo were enormous and ran up to 1,300 or 1,400 bayonets. Of the whole\r\nthirty-nine battalions only three belonged to the old regular army,\r\nand these corps--whose total numbers only reached 2,350 men--had been\r\nlargely diluted with raw recruits[406]. Of the remainder some belonged\r\nto the _tercios_ who had taken arms in June, and had served through\r\nthe first siege of Saragossa, but a large number had only been raised\r\nafter Verdier had retired from before the city in August. It would seem\r\nthat the total of Palafox’s Aragonese, who went to the front for the\r\ncampaign of October and November, was about 12,000 men. The rest were\r\nleft behind at Saragossa, being not yet organized or equipped for field\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n  [405] See the tables in Arteche, iii. 479, 480. The Regiment of\r\n  Calatayud was only 310 strong, that of Doyle 306, and that of\r\n  Navarre 302; on the other hand the 2nd Volunteers of Aragon had\r\n  1,302, the 1st Volunteers of Huesca 1,319, and the overgrown\r\n  ‘Aragonese Fusiliers’ no less than 1,836.\r\n\r\n  [406] 3rd Spanish Guards 609, Estremadura 600, 1st Volunteers of\r\n  Aragon 1,141. These figures are from a return of Nov. 1, sent to\r\n  England by Colonel Doyle, then in high favour with Palafox. It\r\n  may be found in the Record Office.\r\n\r\nBut Palafox had also in his army troops which did not belong to his\r\nnative kingdom. These were the Murcians and Valencians of Saint March\r\nand O’Neille, who after taking part in the campaign against Moncey,\r\nhad not marched with Llamas to Madrid, but had turned off to aid in\r\nraising the siege of Saragossa. Saint March had brought with him\r\nfourteen battalions and a cavalry regiment, O’Neille had with him three\r\nmore infantry corps. The total of their force reached 11,200 bayonets\r\nand 620 sabres. Adding these to the best of his own Aragonese levies,\r\nPalafox sent out 23,000 men: of these only about 800 were cavalry[407].\r\nA force such as this, backed by the mass of unorganized levies at\r\nSaragossa, was barely sufficient to maintain a defensive position on\r\nthe frontiers of Aragon. But the Junta, with great unwisdom, came to\r\nthe conclusion that Palafox was strong enough not only to hold his own\r\nagainst the French in his immediate front, but to spare some troops\r\nto reinforce the army of Catalonia. By their orders he told off six\r\nbattalions--some 4,000 men--who were placed under the command of his\r\nbrother, the Marquis of Lazan, and dispatched to Lerida with the object\r\nof aiding the Captain-General of Catalonia to besiege Duhesme in\r\nBarcelona.\r\n\r\n  [407] The Valencian and Murcian contributions to the army of\r\n  Aragon consisted of the following troops:--One old line regiment\r\n  of three battalions (Volunteers of Castile), the militia\r\n  battalion of Soria, and of new levies the 1st and 2nd Volunteers\r\n  of Murcia, the 2nd Volunteers of Valencia, the regiments of Turia\r\n  (three battalions), Alicante (three battalions), Segorbe (two\r\n  battalions), Borbon, Chelva, and Cazadores de Fernando VII, the\r\n  Dragoons of Numancia (an old corps), and two squadrons of new\r\n  Valencian cavalry. I get these names partly from the return of\r\n  Nov. 1 in the Record Office at London, partly from Saint March’s\r\n  return of his killed and wounded at Tudela. Some more Murcian\r\n  corps started to join Palafox, but were not in time for Tudela,\r\n  though they took part in the second defence of Saragossa: viz.\r\n  3rd and 5th Volunteers of Murcia, the regiment of Florida Blanca,\r\n  and 1st and 2nd Tiradores of Murcia. Their start from Murcia on\r\n  Oct. 13 is noted in the _Madrid Gazette_ of 1808 (p. 1,336).\r\n\r\nNor was this the only force that was drawn off from the main theatre\r\nof the war in order to take part in helping the Catalans, who had\r\nhitherto proved quite strong enough to help themselves. The Junta\r\ndirected Reding, the victor of Baylen, to take command of all the\r\nGranadan troops in the army of Andalusia, and lead them to Tortosa\r\nwith the object of joining Lazan. With Reding there marched nearly\r\n15,000 men[408]: to raise this force all the regiments belonging to the\r\nkingdom of Granada had been drafted out from the 1st and 2nd Divisions\r\nof Castaños’ army, which were thus mutilated before they reached the\r\nEbro. To those comparatively veteran troops were added eight new\r\nbattalions of raw levies--the regiments of Baza, Almeria, Loxa, and\r\nSanta Fé. Starting on their long march from Granada on October 8, the\r\nhead of Reding’s column had only reached Murcia on October 22, and was\r\nthus hopelessly distant from any point where it could have been useful\r\nwhen the campaign began[409]. Nor was this the last detachment which\r\nthe Junta directed on Catalonia: it sent thither part of the prisoners\r\nfrom Lisbon, whom the Convention of Cintra had delivered--3,500 of the\r\nmen who had once formed the division of Caraffa. Laguna, who now held\r\nthe command, landed from English transports at La Rapita near Tortosa\r\non October 25, and marched from thence on Tarragona[410].\r\n\r\n  [408] Just 14,970, according to the details given in the _Madrid\r\n  Gazette_ for Oct. 12 (p. 1,379). See my Appendix on the Spanish\r\n  forces in Oct.-Nov.\r\n\r\n  [409] _Madrid Gazette_, Oct. 28 (p. 1,381).\r\n\r\n  [410] Ibid., Nov. 1 (p. 1,407).\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that of these 23,000 men transferred to Catalonia\r\nfrom Aragon, Granada, and Portugal, every man ought to have been\r\npushed forward to help Castaños on the Ebro, and not distracted to the\r\nside-issue at Barcelona. It was mad to send them thither when the main\r\nforce facing Jourdan and King Joseph did not yet amount to 75,000 men.\r\nCatalonia, with such small aid as the Balearic Islands could give, was\r\nstrong enough to defend herself against the motley hordes of Duhesme\r\nand Reille.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the feeble offensive of Castaños and Palafox began,\r\non the line of the Ebro, the French had some 65,000 men ranged opposite\r\nthem[411], while a reserve of 10,000 was formed at Bayonne, and the\r\nleading columns of the ‘Grand Army’ from Germany were only ten or\r\ntwelve marches away. Napoleon had, by a decree issued on September\r\n7, recast the form of his army of Spain. It was in the future to\r\nconsist of seven army corps. The 1st, 4th, and 5th were to be composed\r\nof old divisions from the Rhine and the Elbe. Of the forces already\r\non the spot Bessières’ troops were to form the 2nd Corps, Moncey’s\r\nthe 3rd, the still incomplete divisions under Ney the 6th. The army\r\nof Catalonia, where St. Cyr was superseding Reille, formed the 7th\r\nCorps[412]. Junot’s army from Portugal, when it once more appeared\r\nupon the scene, made the 8th, but in September Napoleon did not yet\r\nknow of its fate, and it only received its number and its place in the\r\nhost at a much later date. Many alterations of detail were made in the\r\nbrigades and divisions that formed the new 2nd and 3rd Corps. All the\r\n_bataillons de marche_ were abolished, and their men drafted into the\r\nold regiments. The fifteen ‘provisional regiments,’ which had composed\r\nthe whole of Moncey’s and a considerable part of Bessières’ strength,\r\nwere taken into the regular establishment of the army, and renumbered\r\nas the 114th-120th of the Line and the 33rd Léger, two provisional\r\nregiments being told off to form each of the new bodies[413]. There was\r\na certain amount of shifting of units, but in the main the brigades and\r\ndivisions of these two corps remained intact.\r\n\r\n  [411] The figures given by Jourdan in his _Mémoires_ seem\r\n  quite accurate, and are borne out by all the details in _Nap.\r\n  Corresp._; they are:--\r\n      Corps of Bessières [2nd Corps]         17,597\r\n      Corps of Moncey [3rd Corps]            20,747\r\n      Corps of Ney [6th Corps], incomplete    8,957\r\n      The King’s general reserve              6,088\r\n      Garrisons of Navarre and Biscay        11,559\r\n                                             ------\r\n                                             64,948\r\n\r\n  [412] It was originally to be called the 5th, but this title was\r\n  taken from it, in order that Mortier’s corps might keep its old\r\n  number.\r\n\r\n  [413] For their distribution see p. 110.\r\n\r\nOn or about October 8-10 Bessières lay at Miranda and Murguia, guarding\r\nagainst any possible descent of Blake from Villarcayo upon the Upper\r\nEbro. Ney was at La Guardia, facing Pignatelli’s Castilians, who\r\noccupied his old head quarters at Logroño. Moncey had thrown back his\r\nleft to guard against a possible descent of Palafox upon Navarre, and\r\nwas behind the line of the river Aragon, with his right at Estella,\r\nhis centre at Falces and Tafalla, and his left facing Sanguesa, where\r\nit was opposed by the advanced division of the army of Palafox under\r\nO’Neille. For the Captain-General of Aragon, pleased with a plan\r\nproposed to him by Colonel Doyle, the English military attaché in his\r\ncamp, had resolved to make a long turning movement under the roots of\r\nthe Pyrenees, exactly parallel to that which Blake was executing at the\r\nother end of the line. With this object he sent out from Saragossa,\r\non September 29, O’Neille with a division of Aragonese strengthened\r\nby a few Murcian and Valencian battalions, and numbering some 9,000\r\nbayonets. This detachment, marching in a leisurely way, reached\r\nSanguesa on the Upper Aragon, but there stopped short, on getting\r\ninformation that Moncey’s corps lay before it in some strength. Palafox\r\nthen sent up in support a second division, Saint March’s Murcians\r\nand Valencians, who advanced to Egea and there halted. There was\r\nconsiderable bickering all through the second half of October on this\r\nline, but Sanguesa remained in the hands of the Spaniards, Moncey being\r\ntoo much distracted by the movements of Castaños in the direction of\r\nTudela to dare to concentrate his whole force for a blow at Saint March\r\nand O’Neille. The latter, on the other hand, had realized that if they\r\npressed further forward towards Pampeluna, as their commander-in-chief\r\nhad originally intended, they would leave Moncey so much in their rear\r\nthat he could cut them off both from Saragossa and from the Army of the\r\nCentre. Here then matters had come to a deadlock; but the position was\r\nall in favour of the French, who lay compactly in the centre, while\r\nO’Neille and Saint March were separated from Castaños by a gap of sixty\r\nmiles, and Blake on the other wing was about seventy (as the crow\r\nflies) from the army of Castile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE PRELIMINARY FIGHTING: ARRIVAL OF NAPOLEON\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the middle of October the French and Spanish armies were in presence\r\nof each other along the whole line of the Ebro, and it seemed certain\r\nthat one or other of them must at last take the offensive. Both were\r\nstill in expectation of reinforcements, but those which the Spaniards\r\ncould expect to receive within the next few weeks were comparatively\r\nunimportant, while their adversaries knew that more than 100,000 men\r\nfrom Germany were due at Bayonne in the last days of October. Clearly\r\nit was for Castaños and his colleagues to make a move now or never. The\r\nwasted months of August and September could not be recalled, but there\r\nwas still time to attack Bessières, Ney, and Moncey, before the arrival\r\nof the Emperor and the three veteran corps from the Elbe.\r\n\r\nMatters lay thus when the Spanish generals resolved on a perfectly new\r\nand wildly impracticable scheme. Castaños had come to the conclusion--a\r\nthoroughly sound one--that his 34,000 men were too few to make a\r\nfrontal attack on the French on the line between Miranda and Calahorra.\r\nHe left Madrid on October 13, deeply chagrined to find that the Central\r\nJunta had no intention of making him commander-in-chief. Instead of\r\nbeing able to issue orders to the other generals, he must meet them on\r\nequal terms and endeavour to cajole them into adopting a common plan\r\nof operations. Accordingly he rode to Saragossa to visit Palafox, and\r\nafter long and not very friendly converse drew out a new plan. The Army\r\nof the Centre was to shift itself down the Ebro, leaving the troops of\r\nPignatelli (the ‘Army of Castile’) and of Grimarest (the 2nd Andalusian\r\ndivision) to ‘contain’ Ney and Bessières. The rest were to concentrate\r\nat Tudela, where they were to be joined by as many battalions of the\r\nAragonese levies at Saragossa as could take the field. With some 25,000\r\nor 30,000 men at the highest estimate, Castaños and Palafox were to\r\nfall upon Moncey’s flank at the bridge of Caparrosa. Meanwhile O’Neille\r\nand Saint March, with the advanced divisions of the army of Aragon,\r\nwere to break up from Sanguesa, march round Pampeluna by the foot-hills\r\nof the Pyrenees, and place themselves across the road to France. Moncey\r\nwas thus to be surrounded, and a second Baylen was to ensue! Indeed,\r\nif Blake could be persuaded to push forward once more to Bilbao, and\r\nthence into Guipuzcoa, the whole army of King Joseph (as it was hoped)\r\nmight be cut off and made prisoners. Eighty thousand men, according\r\nto this strange scheme, starting from bases 200 miles apart, were to\r\nsurround 65,000 French in a most difficult mountain country. Meanwhile\r\nthe enormous gap between Blake’s right and Castaños’ left was to\r\nremain wholly unguarded, for the army of Estremadura was still in the\r\nfar distance; while nothing was to be left opposite Bessières and Ney\r\nsave Pignatelli’s disorderly ‘Army of Castile,’ and Grimarest’s 6,000\r\nAndalusians.\r\n\r\nBut before the scheme for the cutting off of Moncey had even begun\r\nto be carried out, Castaños and Palafox had a rude awakening. They\r\nwere themselves attacked by the army which they were so confidently\r\nproposing to surround. King Joseph, emboldened by the long delay of his\r\nadversaries in advancing, had several times discussed with Jourdan,\r\nBessières, and Ney schemes for taking the offensive. Indeed he had\r\nsketched out in September no less than five separate plans for bringing\r\nthe enemy to an action, and it is probable that he might have tried one\r\nof them if he had been allowed a free hand[414]. Napoleon, however,\r\nhaving determined to come to Spain in person, put an embargo on any\r\ncomprehensive scheme for an advance on Madrid, and restricted his\r\nbrother to minor operations.\r\n\r\n  [414] The paper containing them was captured in Joseph’s carriage\r\n  at Vittoria five years later. It will be found printed in full in\r\n  Napier (Appendix to vol. i, pp. 453, 454).\r\n\r\nBut there was nothing in the Emperor’s instructions which forbade\r\na blow on a small scale, if the Spaniards should grow too daring.\r\nThere was now a good excuse for such a move, for both Pignatelli and\r\nGrimarest had been trespassing beyond the Ebro. They seem to have moved\r\nforward quite contrary to the intentions of Castaños, who at this\r\nmoment was proposing to refuse battle with his left and centre, and to\r\ndraw the bulk of his army southward to Tudela. But his two divisional\r\ngenerals pushed so far forward, that they at last drew upon themselves\r\nmost undesired attentions from the French marshals. Pignatelli\r\nhad thrown troops across the Ebro to Viana: Grimarest had pushed\r\ndetachments still further forward into Navarre, to Mendavia, Sesma,\r\nand Lerin. Joseph and Jourdan resolved to drive back these outlying\r\nposts, and to find out what was behind them. About 25,000 men were put\r\nin movement against the 16,000 Spaniards who had so rashly crossed the\r\nriver. Moncey marched against Grimarest [Oct. 25-6] with two divisions:\r\nNey with a similar force fell upon Pignatelli, while Bessières sent a\r\ndivision down the southern bank of the Ebro by Haro and Briones, to\r\nthreaten the line of retreat of the army of Castile across the bridge\r\nof Logroño.\r\n\r\nAgainst such forces the Spaniards could do nothing: on the twenty-fifth\r\nNey marched on Viana, and drove in Pignatelli’s advanced guard. On the\r\nfollowing day he opened a fierce cannonade upon Logroño from across the\r\nriver, while at the same time Bonnet’s division, sent by Bessières,\r\nmarched upon the town from the hither side of the Ebro. Pignatelli was\r\na craven, and his Castilian levies proved to be the worst of all the\r\nmaterial which the Spaniards had brought to the front. General and\r\narmy vanished in the night, without even stopping to blow up the great\r\nbridge, though they had mined it and laid the train in due form. Ney’s\r\nofficers crossing at dawn found all prepared, except the sappers who\r\nshould have applied the match[415]! Neither Ney nor Bonnet got in touch\r\nwith the flying horde: but in sheer panic Pignatelli abandoned his\r\nguns by the roadside, and did not stop till he had joined Castaños at\r\nCintruenigo, near Tudela. His hurried retreat was wholly unnecessary,\r\nfor the French did not move beyond Logroño, and Castaños was able to\r\nsend out next morning a brigade which picked up the deserted guns\r\nand brought them in without molestation. Rightly indignant, the\r\nCommander-in-chief removed Pignatelli from his post, and distributed\r\nhis demoralized battalions among the divisions of Grimarest, La Peña,\r\nand Llamas[416], leaving in separate existence only a single brigade\r\nof six battalions under Cartaojal, which mainly consisted of the few\r\nregular battalions that had been lent to Pignatelli to stiffen his raw\r\nlevies. Thus the ‘Army of Castile’ ceased to exist[417].\r\n\r\n  [415] For an account of this curious affair see the _Mémoires_\r\n  of General Boulart, then an artillery officer under Ney, who\r\n  discovered the flight of the Castilians and the abandoned mine\r\n  below the bridge (pp. 202, 203). Oddly enough he gives the wrong\r\n  date for the incident, Oct. 30 instead of Oct. 27.\r\n\r\n  [416] I cannot find any details as to their redistribution.\r\n\r\n  [417] See Colonel Graham’s _Diary_, p. 275 (Oct. 30). He reached\r\n  Castaños’ camp on that day.\r\n\r\nOn the same day that the Castilians were routed by Ney, the 2nd\r\nAndalusian division was severely handled by Moncey. When that Marshal\r\nadvanced against Lerin and Sesma with the divisions of Morlot and\r\nMaurice Mathieu, Grimarest withdrew beyond the Ebro, abandoning by\r\nsome oversight his vanguard. This force, commanded by a resolute\r\nofficer, Colonel Cruz-Murgeon, was enveloped at Lerin by the division\r\nof Morlot[418]. The colonel shut himself up in the mediaeval castle of\r\nthat town, and defended himself for two days, in hopes that he might\r\nbe succoured. But his chief had fled beyond the river, and could not\r\nbe induced to return by any appeals. On October 27 Cruz-Murgeon had to\r\nsurrender, after two-thirds of his troops had been killed or wounded.\r\nTheir obstinate defence was the more creditable because they were all\r\nnew levies, consisting of a single Andalusian battalion (_Tiradores\r\nde Cadiz_) and a few Catalan volunteers. Marshal Moncey then occupied\r\nLodosa and its bridge, but made no attempt to follow Grimarest, who was\r\nable to rejoin his chief without further loss.\r\n\r\n  [418] Jourdan in his _Mémoires_ (p. 77) says that it was Morlot\r\n  who acted against Lerin, and I follow him rather than those who\r\n  state that it was Maurice Mathieu.\r\n\r\nCastaños was greatly disturbed by the vigorous offensive movement of\r\nNey and Moncey. Seeing the French so strong and so confident, he was\r\nstruck with sudden qualms as to the advisability of the movement on\r\nCaparrosa and Pampeluna, which he and Palafox had agreed to carry out.\r\nHe proposed to his colleague that they should drop their plan for\r\nsurrounding Moncey, and attempt no more than an attack on his flanks at\r\nCaparrosa and Sanguesa. Meanwhile he concentrated the greater part of\r\nhis army at Calahorra and Tudela [Oct. 29]. The initiative had passed\r\nto the French, and if Ney and Moncey did not seize the opportunity for\r\nan advance against the Army of the Centre, it was merely because they\r\nknew that Napoleon was now close at hand--he reached Bayonne four days\r\nlater--and would not wish them to attempt anything decisive without his\r\norders.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there arrived from Madrid a deputation from the Supreme\r\nJunta, consisting of Francisco Palafox (the younger brother of the\r\nCaptain-General), of Coupigny, Reding’s colleague at the victory of\r\nBaylen, and the intriguing Conde de Montijo. The Junta were indignant\r\nthat Castaños had not made bricks without straw. Though they had not\r\ngiven him any appreciable reinforcements, they had expected him to\r\nattack the French and win a great victory beyond the Ebro. Conscious\r\nthat the deputies came to him in no friendly spirit, Castaños\r\nnevertheless received them with all respect, and laid before them the\r\ndifficulties of his situation. Joseph Palafox came up from Saragossa\r\nto join the conference, and after a long and stormy meeting--this was\r\nthe conference which so disgusted Colonel Graham[419]--it was decided\r\nto resume offensive operations [November 5]. The idea was a mad one,\r\nfor six days before the council of war was held two French army corps,\r\nthose of Victor and Lefebvre, had crossed the Bidassoa and entered\r\nSpain. There were now 110,000 instead of 65,000 enemies in front of the\r\nSpanish armies. Moreover, and this was still more important, Napoleon\r\nhimself had reached Bayonne on November 3.\r\n\r\n  [419] Cf. p. 366 and Graham’s _Diary_, p. 276.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it was resolved once more to push forward and fall upon\r\nMoncey. Castaños was to leave one division at Calahorra, and to bring\r\nthe rest of his army over the Ebro to attack the bridge of Caparrosa:\r\nO’Neille and Saint March were to come down from Sanguesa to co-operate\r\nwith him: Joseph Palafox was to bring up the Aragonese reserves from\r\nSaragossa. The only sign of prudence that appeared was that the council\r\nof war agreed not to commence the attack on Moncey till they had\r\nlearnt how Blake and the army of Galicia were faring in Biscay. For\r\nthat general had, as they knew, commenced some days before his second\r\nadvance on Bilbao. Since the armies on the Central Ebro hung back,\r\nit was in the distant region on the coast that the first important\r\ncollision between the Spaniards and the French reinforcements from\r\nGermany was to take place. For a fortnight more there was comparative\r\nquiet in front of Tudela and Caparrosa. Meanwhile Castaños, prostrated\r\nby an attack of the gout[420], took to his bed, and the Army of the\r\nCentre was abandoned for a few days to the tender mercies of the\r\ndeputation from Madrid.\r\n\r\n  [420] According to Toreño; but Graham, who was present in the\r\n  camp, calls it rheumatism.\r\n\r\nThere is a strange contrast when we turn from the study of the rash\r\nand inconsiderate plans of the Spanish generals to mark the movements\r\nof Napoleon. The Emperor had left Erfurt on October 14: on the\r\nnineteenth he had reached Paris, where he stayed for ten days, busied\r\nnot only with the ‘logistics’ of moving the columns of the ‘Grand Army’\r\nacross France, but with all manner of administrative work. He had also\r\nto arrange the details of the conscription: though he had raised in\r\n1807 the enormous mass of new levies of which we had to speak in an\r\nearlier chapter, he now asked for 140,000 men more[421]. Of these,\r\n80,000 were to be drawn from the classes of 1806-9, which had already\r\ncontributed so heavily to the army. The balance was to be taken from\r\nthe class of 1810, whose members were still fifteen months below the\r\nlegal age. From these multitudes of young soldiers every regiment\r\nof the army of Spain was to be brought up to full strength, but the\r\nmajority were destined to reinforce the depleted armies of Germany and\r\nItaly, which had been thinned of veterans for the Peninsular War.\r\n\r\n  [421] See _Nap. Corresp._, 14,312 (xvii. 505, 506), and compare\r\n  with 14,601 (xviii. 141, 142).\r\n\r\nOn October 25 Bonaparte presided at the opening of the Legislative\r\nAssembly, and made a characteristic harangue to its members. He\r\npainted the situation of the Empire in the most roseate colours. ‘The\r\nsight of this great French family, once torn apart by differences of\r\nopinion and domestic hatreds, but now so tranquil, prosperous, and\r\nunited, had sensibly touched his soul. To be happy himself he only\r\nrequired the assurance that France also was happy. Law, finance, the\r\nChurch, every branch of the state, seemed in the most flourishing\r\ncondition. The Empire was strong in its alliances with Russia, the\r\nConfederation of the Rhine, Denmark, Switzerland, and Naples. Great\r\nBritain, it was true, had landed some troops in the Peninsula, and\r\nstirred up insurrections there. But this was a blessing in disguise.\r\nThe Providence which had so constantly protected the arms of France,\r\nhad deigned to strike the English ministry with blindness, and to\r\ninduce them to present an army on the Continent where it was doomed to\r\ninevitable destruction. In a few days the Emperor would place himself\r\nat the head of his troops, and, with the aid of God, would crown in\r\nMadrid the true King of Spain, and plant his eagles on the forts of\r\nLisbon[422].’\r\n\r\n  [422] _Discours prononcé le 25 oct._ (_Nap. Corresp._, xviii. 20,\r\n  21).\r\n\r\nFour days later Bonaparte quitted Paris, and passing hastily through\r\nOrleans and Bordeaux reached Bayonne at three o’clock in the morning\r\nof November 3. The corps of Victor and Lefebvre, with two divisions\r\nof dragoons, were several days ahead of him, and had already crossed\r\nthe Bidassoa. The Imperial Guard and the divisions destined for\r\nNey[423], as well as a great mass of cavalry, were just converging on\r\nthe frontier. Mortier’s corps was not very far off: Junot’s army from\r\nPortugal had already landed at Quiberon and Rochefort, and was being\r\ndirected on Bordeaux. All the machinery for the great blow was now\r\nready.\r\n\r\n  [423] Those of Marchand and Bisson, forming the old 6th Corps,\r\n  with which he fought at Jena and Friedland.\r\n\r\nNapoleon profoundly despised the Spanish army and the Spanish generals.\r\nHis correspondence is full of contemptuous allusions to them: ‘ever\r\nsince he served at Toulon he knew them for the worst troops in Europe.’\r\n‘Nothing could be so bad as the Spaniards--they are mere rabble--6,000\r\nFrench can beat 20,000 of them.’ ‘The whole Spanish army could not\r\nturn 15,000 good troops out of a position that had been properly\r\noccupied[424].’ Nevertheless he had determined to run no risks: the\r\nsecond Peninsular campaign must not end like the first, in a fiasco\r\nand a humiliating retreat. It was for this reason that the Emperor had\r\nmassed more than 250,000 good troops against the tumultuary levies of\r\nthe Junta--a force which, in his private opinion, was far more than\r\nenough to sweep the whole of his adversaries into the sea before the\r\nyear 1808 should have run out. Any expedition in which he himself took\r\npart must, for the sake of his prestige, be conducted from beginning\r\nto end in a series of spectacular triumphs. It was better to use a\r\nlarger army than was absolutely necessary, in order to make his blows\r\nsufficiently heavy, and to get the Spanish business over as rapidly\r\nas possible. If the whole Peninsula were overrun in a few months, and\r\nresistance had been completely beaten down ere the winter was over,\r\nthere would be no chance of that intervention on the part of Austria\r\nwhich was the only danger on the political horizon[425].\r\n\r\n  [424] Napoleon to Joseph Bonaparte, to Caulaincourt, to Eugène\r\n  Beauharnais (vols. xvii, xviii of _Nap. Corresp._).\r\n\r\n  [425] The clearest proof which I find in the _Napoleon\r\n  Correspondance_ of the Emperor’s intention to sweep over the\r\n  whole Peninsula, with a single rush, is that already in November\r\n  he was assembling at Bayonne naval officers who were to take\r\n  charge of the port of Lisbon, and to reorganize the Portuguese\r\n  fleet. This was a little premature! (See Napoleon to Decrès,\r\n  Minister of Marine, _Nap. Corresp._, 14,514, vol. xviii.)\r\n\r\nNapoleon, therefore, drew out his plans not merely for a triumphant\r\nadvance on Madrid, but for the complete annihilation of the Spanish\r\narmies on the Ebro and in Biscay. From a careful study of the\r\ndispatches of his lieutenants, he had realized the existence of the\r\ngreat gap in the direction of Burgos between the armies of Blake and\r\nof Castaños. His plan of campaign, stated shortly, was to burst in\r\nthrough this gap, so as to separate the Spanish armies on his left\r\nand right, and then to wheel troops outwards in both directions so as\r\nto surround and annihilate them. Both Blake and Palafox were, at this\r\nmoment, playing the game that he most desired. The further that the\r\nformer pressed onward into Biscay, the nearer that the latter drew to\r\nthe roots of the Pyrenees, the more did they expose themselves to being\r\nencompassed by great masses of troops breaking out from Burgos and\r\nLogroño to fall upon their flank and rear. When the Emperor drew up his\r\nscheme he knew that Blake was in front of Zornoza, and that the bulk\r\nof the army of Aragon was at Sanguesa. Meanwhile the French advanced\r\ndivisions were in possession of Miranda, Logroño, and Lodosa, the three\r\nchief passages over the Upper Ebro. A glance at the map is sufficient\r\nto show that the moment that the Emperor and his reserves reached\r\nVittoria the Spanish armies were in the most perilous position. It\r\nwould suffice to order a march on Burgos on the one hand and on Tudela\r\non the other, and then the troops of Aragon and Galicia would not\r\nmerely be cut off from any possible retreat on Madrid, but run grave\r\ndanger of annihilation. A further advance of the French would probably\r\nthrust the one against the Pyrenees, and roll the other into the Bay of\r\nBiscay.\r\n\r\nFor this reason it was the Emperor’s wish that his lieutenants should\r\nrefrain from attacking Blake and Palafox till he himself was ready to\r\nmarch on Burgos. For any premature advance against the Spaniards might\r\nforce them to retreat from their dangerous advanced positions, and fall\r\nback the one on Reynosa the other on Saragossa, where they would be\r\nmuch less exposed.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the ‘Grand Army’ was to be as follows. Lefebvre\r\nwith the 4th Corps was to present himself in front of Blake between\r\nDurango and Zornoza, and to hold him fast without pressing him. Moncey\r\nwith the 3rd Corps, in a similar way, was to ‘contain’ Palafox and\r\nCastaños from his posts at Lodosa, Caparrosa, and Tafalla. Meanwhile\r\nVictor, with the newly arrived 1st Corps, was to endeavour to get\r\ninto Blake’s rear, by the road Vittoria--Murguia--Orduña. The main\r\nbody of the army, consisting of the troops of Bessières and Ney, King\r\nJoseph’s reserve, the Imperial Guard, and four divisions of cavalry,\r\nwas to march on Burgos. Napoleon knew that there was no large body\r\nof Spaniards in that place: he expected to find there Pignatelli’s\r\n‘Army of Castile,’ but this force (as we have seen) had ceased to\r\nexist, having been drafted with ignominy into the ranks of the army\r\nof Andalusia[426]. As a matter of fact Burgos was now occupied by a\r\nnew force from the second line--the long-expected army of Estremadura,\r\nsome 12,000 strong, which had at last come up from Madrid and taken\r\nits place at the front. But Napoleon’s reasoning still held good: any\r\nSpanish army that might chance to be at Burgos must be overwhelmed by\r\nthe enormous mass of troops that was about to be hurled upon it. The\r\nmoment that it was disposed of, Ney with the 6th Corps was to wheel\r\nto the east, and march by Aranda and Soria, so as to place himself\r\nbetween Castaños and Palafox and Madrid. Then he would turn their flank\r\nat Tarazona and Tudela, and--in conjunction with Moncey--drive them\r\nnorthward against the Pyrenees. In a similar way, upon the other flank,\r\nthe 2nd Corps was to wheel to the north-west and march from Burgos on\r\nReynosa, there to intercept Blake, if he had not already been cut off\r\nby Victor’s shorter turning movement. Meanwhile the Emperor with the\r\nrest of his army, followed by the new reserves (Mortier’s corps and\r\nother troops) which were due from France, would march straight from\r\nBurgos on Madrid, force the defiles of the Somosierra and Guadarrama,\r\nand seize the Spanish capital. He was well aware that there would be\r\nno serious hostile force in front of him, since the armies of Blake,\r\nPalafox, and Castaños were all provided for. He does not seem to have\r\nknown of the army of Estremadura, or to have had any idea that the\r\nEnglish forces from Portugal might conceivably be on their way to\r\ncover Madrid. There is no mention of Sir John Moore and his host in the\r\nimperial dispatches till December 5.\r\n\r\n  [426] Napoleon to Bessières, Nov. 6: ‘J’ai vu vos dépêches du 5\r\n  novembre sur l’existence d’un corps de 24,000 hommes à Burgos.\r\n  Si cela est, ce ne peut être que 12,000 hommes de l’armée de\r\n  Castille qui ont évacué Logroño, et qui ne sont pas en cas de\r\n  faire tête à 3,000 ou 4,000 de vos gens’ (_Nap. Corresp._,\r\n  14,443, xviii. 38).\r\n\r\nAll being ready, Bonaparte rode out of Bayonne on November 4, having\r\nstayed there only thirty-six hours. Before leaving he had received\r\none vexatious piece of news: Lefebvre, in direct disobedience to his\r\norders, had attacked Blake on October 31, and forced him back beyond\r\nBilbao. This made the plan for the cutting off of the army of Galicia a\r\nlittle more difficult, since the Spaniards were now forty miles further\r\nback, and not nearly so much exposed as they had been hitherto. But it\r\nwas still not impossible that Victor might succeed in circumventing\r\nthem, and forcing them into the Bay of Biscay.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to withhold our admiration from the Emperor’s simple\r\nyet all-embracing plan of operations. It is true that the campaign\r\nwas made more easy by the fact that he was dealing with raw and\r\nundisciplined armies and inexpert generals. It is also clear that he\r\nrightly reckoned on having two men in the field against every one whom\r\nthe Spaniards could produce. But the excellence of a scheme is not to\r\nbe judged merely by the difficulties in its way; and military genius\r\ncan be displayed in dealing with an easy as well as with a dangerous\r\nproblem. Half a dozen other plans for conducting the invasion of Spain\r\nmight have been drawn up, but it is impossible to see that any better\r\none could have been constructed. In its main lines it was carried out\r\nwith complete success: the armies of the Junta were scattered to the\r\nwinds, and Madrid fell almost without a blow.\r\n\r\nIt was only when the capital had been occupied, and the troops of\r\nBlake and Belvedere, of Castaños and Palafox were flying devious over\r\nhalf the provinces of Spain, that the difficulties of the Peninsular\r\nWar began to develop themselves. Napoleon had never before had any\r\nexperience of the character of guerilla warfare, or the kind of\r\nresistance that can be offered by a proud and revengeful nation which\r\nhas made up its mind never to submit to the conqueror. In his complete\r\nignorance of Spain and the Spaniards, he imagined that he had a very\r\nsimple campaign to conduct. The subjugation of the Peninsula was to\r\nhim an ordinary military problem, like the invasion of Lombardy or of\r\nPrussia, and he went forth in cheerful confidence to ‘plant the eagles\r\nof France on the forts of Lisbon,’ and to ‘drive the Britannic leopard\r\nfrom the soil of the Peninsula, which it defiles by its presence.’ But\r\nthe last chapter of this story was to be told not at Lisbon but at\r\nToulouse: and ‘the Beneficent Providence which had deigned to strike\r\nthe British ministry with such blindness that they had been induced to\r\nsend an army to the Continent[427],’ had other designs than Bonaparte\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\n  [427] See page 396.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE MISFORTUNES OF JOACHIM BLAKE: ZORNOZA AND ESPINOSA DE LOS MONTEROS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe campaign of November 1808 was fought out upon three separate\r\ntheatres of war, though every movement of the French armies which\r\nengaged in it formed part of a single plan, and was properly linked to\r\nthe operations which were progressing upon other sections of the front.\r\nThe working out of Napoleon’s great scheme, therefore, must be dealt\r\nwith under three heads--the destruction of Blake’s ‘Army of the Left’\r\nin the north-west; the rout of the armies of Andalusia and Aragon upon\r\nthe banks of the Ebro; and the central advance of the Emperor upon\r\nBurgos and Madrid, which completed the plan.\r\n\r\nWe must first deal with the misfortunes of Blake and his Galician host,\r\nboth on chronological grounds--it was he who first felt the weight\r\nof the French arms--and also because Napoleon rightly attached more\r\nimportance to the destruction of this, the most formidable of the\r\nSpanish armies, than to the other operations which he was carrying out\r\nat the same moment.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that after his first abortive expedition against\r\nBilbao, and his retreat before Ney [October 5], Blake had fallen back\r\nto Valmaceda. Finding that he was not pursued, he drew up to that point\r\nthe divisions which he had hitherto kept in the upper valley of the\r\nEbro, and prepared to advance again, this time with his whole army\r\nmassed for a bold stroke. On October 11 he again marched into Biscay,\r\nand drove out of Bilbao the division of General Merlin, which Ney\r\nhad left behind him to hold the line of the Nervion. On the twelfth\r\nthis small force fell back on Zornoza and Durango, and halted at the\r\nlatter place, after having been reinforced from King Joseph’s reserve\r\nat Vittoria. Verdier headed the succours, which consisted of three\r\nbattalions of the Imperial Guard, two battalions of the 118th Regiment,\r\ntwo battalions of Joseph’s own Royal Guards, and the 36th Regiment,\r\nwhich had just come up from France. When strengthened by these 7,000\r\nmen, Merlin considered himself able to make a stand, and took up a\r\nstrong position in front of Durango, the important point at which the\r\nroads from Bayonne and from Vittoria to Bilbao meet.\r\n\r\nWhen committing himself to his second expedition into Biscay, Blake\r\nwas not wholly unaware of the dangers of the step, though he failed\r\nto realize them at their full value, since (in common with the other\r\nSpanish generals) he greatly underrated the strength of the French army\r\non the Ebro. He intended to carry out his original plan of cutting off\r\nBessières and King Joseph from their retreat on Bayonne, by forcing\r\nthe position of Durango, and seizing the high-road at Bergara; but he\r\nwas aware that an advance to that point had its dangers. As long as\r\nhis divisions had lain in or about Villarcayo and Valmaceda, he had a\r\nperfectly clear line of retreat westward in the event of a disaster.\r\nBut the moment that he pushed forward beyond Bilbao, he could be\r\nattacked in flank and rear by any troops whom the King might send\r\nup from the valley of the Ebro, by the two mountain-roads which run\r\nfrom Vittoria to the Biscayan capital. One of these is the main route\r\nfrom Vittoria to Bilbao via Murguia and Orduña. The other is a more\r\nobscure and difficult path, which leads across the rough watershed\r\nfrom Vittoria by Villareal and Villaro to Bilbao. Aware of the fact\r\nthat he might be assailed by either of these two passes, Blake told\r\noff a strong covering force to hold them. Half of Acevedo’s Asturian\r\ndivision, 4,000 strong, was placed at Orduña: the other half, with\r\nthe whole of Martinengo’s 2nd Division of Galicia, 8,500 bayonets in\r\nall, took its post in the direction of Villaro. These detachments\r\nwere eminently justifiable, but they had the unfortunate result of\r\nenfeebling the main force that remained available for the stroke at\r\nthe French in front of Durango. For that operation Blake could only\r\ncount on his 1st, 3rd, and 4th Divisions, as well as the ‘Vanguard’ and\r\n‘Reserve’ Brigades--a total of 18,000 men[428].\r\n\r\n  [428] Viz.\r\n    Vanguard Brigade, General Mendizabal   2,884\r\n    1st Division, General Figueroa         4,018\r\n    3rd Division, General Riquelme         4,789\r\n    4th Division, General Carbajal         3,531\r\n    Reserve Brigade, General Mahy          3,025\r\n                                          ------\r\n                            Total         18,247\r\n\r\n  The detached corps being--\r\n    2nd Division, General Martinengo       5,066\r\n    Asturian Division, General Acevedo     7,633\r\n\r\nBlake had seized Bilbao on October 11: it is astonishing therefore\r\nto find that he made no forward movement till the twenty-fourth. By\r\nthis sluggishness he sacrificed his chance of crushing Merlin before\r\nhe could be reinforced, and--what was far worse--allowed the leading\r\ncolumns of the ‘Grand Army’ to reach Irun. If he had pressed forward\r\non the twelfth or thirteenth, they would still have been many marches\r\naway, trailing across Guyenne and Gascony. Having once put his hand to\r\nsuch a dangerous manœuvre as that of pushing between the French flank\r\nand the northern sea, Blake was most unwise to leave the enemy time to\r\ndivine his object and to concentrate against him. A rapid stroke at\r\nDurango and Bergara, so as to cut the great high-road to France in the\r\nrear of Bessières, was his only chance. Such an attempt would probably\r\nhave landed him in ultimate disaster, for the enemy (even before the\r\n‘Grand Army’ arrived) were far more numerous than he supposed. He\r\nhad valued them at 40,000 men, while they were really 64,000 strong.\r\nBut having framed the plan, he should at least have made a strenuous\r\nattempt to carry it out. It is possible to explain but not to excuse\r\nhis delay: his army was not equipped for a winter campaign, and the\r\nsnow was beginning to lie on the upper slopes of the Cantabrian hills\r\nand the Pyrenees. While he was vainly trying to obtain great-coats\r\nand shoes for his somewhat tattered army, from the Central Junta or\r\nthe English, and while he was accumulating stores in Bilbao, the days\r\nslipped by with fatal rapidity.\r\n\r\nIt was not till October 24 that he at last moved forward from Bilbao,\r\nand committed himself to the now hopeless task of clearing the way to\r\nDurango and Bergara. On that day his advanced guard drove Merlin’s\r\noutlying posts from their positions, and came face to face with the\r\nFrench main body, drawn out on the hillsides of Baquijano, a few miles\r\nin front of Durango. The enemy expected him to attack next day, but he\r\nhad just received confused notices from the peasantry to the effect\r\nthat enormous reinforcements had reached Irun and San Sebastian, and\r\nwere within supporting distance of the comparatively small force with\r\nwhich he had hitherto been dealing. This information threw him back\r\ninto the condition of doubt and hesitation from which he had for a\r\nmoment emerged, and he proceeded to halt for another full week in\r\nfront of the Durango position. Yet it was clear that there were only\r\ntwo rational alternatives before him: one was to attack Merlin and\r\nVerdier before they could draw succour from the newly arrived corps.\r\nThe other was to fall back at once to a position in which he could not\r\nbe enveloped and outflanked, i.e. to retire behind Bilbao, holding that\r\ntown with nothing more than a small detachment which could easily get\r\naway if attacked. But Blake did nothing, and waited in the supremely\r\ndangerous post of Zornoza, in front of Durango, till the enemy fell\r\nupon him at his leisure.\r\n\r\nThe troops whose arrival at Irun had been reported consisted of the\r\ntwo leading divisions of the 4th Corps, that of Lefebvre, and of the\r\nwhole of the 1st Corps, that of Victor. The former, arriving as early\r\nas October 18, only seven days after Blake captured Bilbao, marched\r\nwestward, and replaced Merlin and Verdier in the Durango position. The\r\ntroops of these two generals were directed by King Joseph to rejoin\r\ntheir proper commanders when relieved, so Verdier led the Guards back\r\nto the central reserve, while Merlin reported himself to Ney, at La\r\nGuardia. To compensate Lefebvre for their departure, and for the\r\nnon-arrival of his third division, that of Valence, which still lay far\r\nto the rear, Villatte’s division of the 1st Corps was sent to Durango.\r\nMarshal Victor himself, with his other two divisions, took the road to\r\nVittoria, and from thence, at the King’s orders, transferred himself to\r\nMurguia, on the cross-road over the mountains to Bilbao. Here he was in\r\na position to strike at Blake’s rear, after driving off the 4,000 men\r\nof Acevedo’s Asturian division, who (as it will be remembered) had been\r\ntold off by the Spanish General to cover this road[429].\r\n\r\n  [429] There is a clear and precise account of all these moves in\r\n  the _Mémoires_ of Jourdan, who was still acting as Joseph’s chief\r\n  of the staff (pp. 79-81).\r\n\r\nKing Joseph, inclining for once to a bold stroke, wished to push Victor\r\nacross the hills on to Bilbao, while Lefebvre should advance along\r\nthe high-road and drive Blake into the trap. Bessières at the same\r\nmoment might move a division by Orduña and Oquendo, and place himself\r\nat Valmaceda, which Blake would have to pass if he escaped from Victor\r\nat Bilbao. This plan was eminently sound, for there was no doubt that\r\nthe two marshals, who had at their disposal some 35,000 men, could\r\neasily have brushed out of their way the two divisions under Acevedo\r\nand Martinengo which Blake had left behind him in the passes. Nothing\r\ncould have prevented them from seizing Bilbao and Valmaceda, and the\r\nSpanish army would have been surrounded and captured. At the best some\r\npart of it might have escaped along the coast-road to Santander, if its\r\ncommander detected ere it was too late the full danger of his position.\r\n\r\nThis scheme, however, was not carried out: Bessières, Victor, and\r\nNey showed themselves opposed to it: Napoleon had announced that he\r\nintended ere long to appear in person, and that he did not wish to\r\nhave matters hurried before his arrival. His obsequious lieutenants\r\nrefused to concur in any great general movement which might not win\r\nhis approval. Victor, in particular, urged that he had been ordered to\r\nhave the whole of the 1st Corps concentrated at Vittoria, and that if\r\nhe marched northward into Biscay he would be violating his master’s\r\nexpress command[430]. Joseph and Jourdan, therefore, resolved to defer\r\nthe execution of their plan for the annihilation of Blake, and sent\r\norders to Lefebvre to maintain his defensive position at Durango, and\r\nmake no forward movement. In so doing they were acting exactly as the\r\nEmperor desired.\r\n\r\n  [430] Jourdan’s _Mémoires_, p. 79.\r\n\r\nThey had forgotten, however, to reckon with the personal ambition of\r\nthe old Duke of Dantzig. Lefebvre, in spite of his many campaigns, had\r\nnever before had the chance of fighting on his own account a pitched\r\nbattle of the first class. The Spanish army had been lying before him\r\nfor a week doing nothing, its commander being evidently afraid to\r\nattack. Its force was not very great--indeed it was outnumbered by\r\nthat of the Marshal whose three divisions counted not less than 21,000\r\nbayonets[431]. Noting with the eye of an old soldier Blake’s indecision\r\nand obvious timidity, he could not resist the temptation of falling\r\nupon him. Notwithstanding the King’s orders, he resolved to strike,\r\ncovering his disobedience by a futile excuse to the effect that he\r\nhad observed preparations for taking the offensive on the part of the\r\nenemy, and that his outposts had been attacked.\r\n\r\n  [431] He had\r\n  Sebastiani’s Division, 28th (three batts.), 32nd, 58th\r\n    (two batts. each), and 75th of the Line (three batts.)   5,808\r\n  Leval’s Division, seven German and two Dutch battalions    8,347\r\n  Villatte’s Division, 27th, 63rd, 94th, and 95th of the\r\n    Line (each of three batts.)                              7,169\r\n                                                            ------\r\n                                   Total                    21,324\r\n\r\n  Arteche gives twelve German battalions (iii. 491); but the\r\n  Frankfort Regiment had only one battalion, those of Nassau,\r\n  Baden, and Darmstadt two each. The figures are those of the\r\n  return of Oct. 10.\r\n\r\nBlake’s army lay before him, posted in three lines, with the village of\r\nZornoza to its rear. In front, on a range of comparatively low hills,\r\nwas the ‘Vanguard Brigade,’ drawn up across the road with the 1st\r\nDivision of Galicia to its left on somewhat higher ground. They were\r\nsupported by the 3rd and 4th Divisions, while the ‘Reserve Brigade’\r\noccupied the houses of Zornoza to the rear of all. There were only six\r\nguns with the army, as Blake had sent the rest of his artillery to the\r\nrear, when advancing into the mountains: this single battery lay with\r\nthe Vanguard on the lower heights. The whole amounted to 19,000 men, a\r\nslight reinforcement having just come to hand by the arrival of the 1st\r\nCatalonian Light Infantry[432], the advanced guard of La Romana’s army\r\nfrom the Baltic. That general, having landed at Santander on October\r\n11, had reorganized his force as the ‘5th Division of the army of\r\nGalicia’ and sent it forward under his senior brigadier, the Conde de\r\nSan Roman. But only the single Catalonian battalion had passed Bilbao\r\nat the moment when Lefebvre delivered his attack.\r\n\r\n  [432] It counted 1,066 bayonets when entering on the campaign,\r\n  and was attached to the Vanguard.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the Marshal’s advance was quite simple. The division of\r\nVillatte drove in the front line of the Spanish right, and then spread\r\nitself out on a long front threatening to turn Blake’s flank. That\r\nof Sebastiani, formed in a single dense column, marched along the\r\nhigh-road at the bottom of the valley to pierce the Spanish centre;\r\nmeanwhile Leval’s Germans attacked the left wing of the enemy, the\r\n1st Division of the army of Galicia[433]. A dense fog, a common\r\nphenomenon in the Pyrenees in the late autumn, hid the advance of\r\nthe French, so that they were close upon the front line of Blake’s\r\narmy before they were observed. The first line was easily driven in,\r\nbut the whole army rallied on the heights of San Martin and stood at\r\nbay. Lefebvre cannonaded them for some time, without meeting with any\r\nreply, for Blake had hurried off his single battery to the rear when\r\nhis first line gave way. Then the Marshal sent in the ten battalions\r\nof the division of Sebastiani, who completely cut through the Spanish\r\ncentre, and left the two wings in isolated and dangerous positions.\r\nWithout waiting for further developments, Blake gave way and ordered\r\na retreat on Bilbao and Valmaceda. His intact wing-divisions covered\r\nthe retreat, and though badly beaten he got away with very small loss,\r\nno more than 300 killed and wounded, and about the same number of\r\nprisoners. The French casualties were insignificant, not amounting in\r\nall to more than 200 men. The whole combat, indeed, though 40,000 men\r\nwere on the field, was very short and not at all costly. The fact was\r\nthat Blake had been surprised, and had given way at the first push,\r\nwithout making a serious attempt to defend himself. His sending away\r\nthe guns, at the very commencement of the action, makes it sufficiently\r\nclear that he did not hope for ultimate success, and was already\r\ncontemplating a retreat on Bilbao. His army, if properly handled, could\r\nhave made a much more creditable fight; in fact it was tactically\r\nbeaten rather than defeated by force of arms. It made its retreat in\r\nvery fair order, and was irritated rather than cowed by the check which\r\nit had received. English eye-witnesses vouch for the steadiness and\r\ngood spirit shown by the troops[434].\r\n\r\n  [433] Captain Carroll, an eye-witness, gives a good account of\r\n  this action in his report to General Leith, dated from Valmaceda\r\n  on Nov. 2.\r\n\r\n  [434] Report of Captain Carroll in papers of 1809 in the Record\r\n  Office.\r\n\r\nImmediately after giving orders for a general retreat behind the river\r\nNervion, Blake had sent dispatches to the two divisions of Acevedo\r\nand Martinengo, which were covering his flank against a possible\r\nturning movement from the valley of the Ebro. They were told to save\r\nthemselves, by falling back at once to Bilbao and joining the main\r\narmy in its retreat. The part of the Asturian division which lay at\r\nOrduña succeeded in carrying out this order. But the remainder of\r\nAcevedo’s men and the whole of those of Martinengo--some 8,000 bayonets\r\nin all--were at Villaro, a point higher up in the mountains, on a\r\nmuch more difficult road, and closer to the French. They received\r\nBlake’s dispatch too late, and on pushing down the northern side of\r\nthe pass which they had been holding, they learnt at Miravalles, only\r\nten miles from Bilbao, that the latter town was in the hands of the\r\nFrench. Blake had evacuated it on the early morning of November 1, and\r\nLefebvre had occupied it on the same night. Urging his pursuit some\r\nway beyond Bilbao in the hope of overtaking Blake, the duke pushed as\r\nfar as Valmaceda: but even here the Galician army would make no stand,\r\nbut fell back still further westward to Nava. Seeing that he could\r\nnot reach his adversary, Lefebvre left the division of Villatte at\r\nValmaceda to observe Blake, and returned with those of Sebastiani and\r\nLeval to Bilbao, to feed and rest his men in the town, after four days\r\nof marching in the mountains with very insufficient supplies. This\r\nwas a very dangerous step, for Blake had been outmanœuvred rather than\r\nbeaten, and was still far too strong to be contained by a mere 7,000\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nWhen therefore Acevedo and his column drew near to Bilbao, they learnt\r\nthat 13,000 French troops blocked their road towards Blake [Nov. 3].\r\nThey drew back a little up the pass, keeping very quiet, and very\r\nfortunately failed to attract the attention of Lefebvre, who thought at\r\nthe most that there were some bands of stragglers in the mountains on\r\nhis left.\r\n\r\nBut their situation was still most uncomfortable, for their rearguard\r\nbegan to report that French troops were pushing up from Vittoria and\r\nentering the southern end of the defile in which they were blocked.\r\nKing Joseph had been much vexed to hear of Lefebvre’s disobedience\r\nto his orders at Zornoza, but, wishing to draw what profit he could\r\nfrom the victory, sent Victor up the Murguia--Orduña road, with\r\norders to cut in upon the line of Blake’s retreat. This the Duke of\r\nBelluno failed to accomplish, on account of the rapidity with which\r\nthe Spanish army had retired. But reaching Amurrio, a few miles beyond\r\nOrduña, he came upon the flank of Acevedo’s column, whose head was\r\nblocked at Miravalles, ten miles further north, by the presence of\r\nLefebvre at Bilbao. If either marshal had realized the situation, the\r\n8,000 Spaniards, caught in a defile without lateral issues, must have\r\nsurrendered _en masse_. But Victor had only one division with him, the\r\nother was far behind: and imagining that he had chanced upon the whole\r\nof Blake’s army he came to a dead stop, while Lefebvre, not yet aware\r\nof Victor’s approach, did not move at all. Acevedo wisely kept quiet,\r\nand tried to slip across Victor’s front towards Orantia and the river\r\nSalcedon: meanwhile the news of his situation reached Blake.\r\n\r\nThat general was never wanting in personal courage, and had been deeply\r\ndistressed to hear that his flanking detachment had been cut off.\r\nRealizing Acevedo’s danger he resolved to make a sudden ‘offensive\r\nreturn’ against Lefebvre, and to endeavour to clear for a moment the\r\nroad from Miravalles to Valmaceda, by which his subordinate could\r\nescape. On the night of November 4 he concentrated his whole army,\r\nwhich had now been raised to 24,000 men by the arrival of the main\r\nbody of La Romana’s division from Santander. At dawn on the fifth he\r\nfell upon the enemy in his front, by the two roads on each side of the\r\nriver Salcedon, sending one division[435] and the ‘Vanguard Brigade’\r\nto attack Valmaceda, and two[436] and the ‘Reserve Brigade’ by Orantia\r\nalong the southern bank of the stream. Villatte had been holding both\r\nthese paths; but on seeing the heavy forces deployed against him, he\r\nwithdrew from Orantia and concentrated at Valmaceda. This left the\r\npath clear for Acevedo, who escaped along the hillsides without being\r\nmolested by Victor’s advanced guard, and got into communication with\r\nhis chief. The inactivity of Victor is inexplicable: when he saw the\r\nAsturian division pushing hastily across his front, he should have\r\nattacked it at all costs; but though he heard plainly the cannonade of\r\nVillatte’s fight with Blake at Valmaceda, he held back, and finally\r\nretired on Orduña when Acevedo had got out of sight[437]. His only\r\nexcuse was that he had heard the distant roar of battle die down,\r\nand concluded therefore that Villatte (who as he supposed might be\r\nsupported by the whole of Lefebvre’s corps) must have been victorious.\r\n\r\n  [435] The 4th Division.\r\n\r\n  [436] The 1st and 3rd Divisions. See the dispatches of Captain\r\n  Carroll from Valmaceda, dated Nov. 5, in the Record Office.\r\n\r\n  [437] Napoleon, furious at the escape of the Asturians,\r\n  administered a fiery rebuke to the Marshal. ‘He had left one of\r\n  his own divisions, exposed by Lefebvre’s imprudence, to run the\r\n  risk of annihilation. He had never gone to the front himself to\r\n  look at Acevedo, but had allowed the reconnoitring to be done\r\n  by an incapable subordinate. His guess that Villatte had been\r\n  victorious and did not need help was absurd; why should the dying\r\n  down of the fire mean that the French were successful rather than\r\n  beaten? The first principles of the art of war prescribe that a\r\n  general should march toward the cannon, when he knows that his\r\n  colleagues are engaged’ (_Nap. Corresp._, 14,445).\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the isolated French division had almost suffered\r\nthe fate that should have befallen the Asturians. Driven out of\r\nValmaceda by Blake, it was falling back on Guenes when it came across\r\nAcevedo’s men marching on the opposite side of the Salcedon to join\r\ntheir comrades. Thereupon the Asturian general threw some of his\r\nmen[438] across the stream to intercept the retiring column. Villatte\r\nformed his troops in a solid mass and broke through, but left behind\r\nhim one gun (an eight-pounder), many of his baggage-wagons, and 300\r\nprisoners. That he escaped at all is a fine testimony to his resolution\r\nand his capable handling of his troops, for he had been most wantonly\r\nexposed to destruction by Victor’s timidity and Lefebvre’s carelessness\r\n[November 5].\r\n\r\n  [438] One battalion of Segovia and two of volunteers of Galicia.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of Villatte’s desperate situation, the Duke of Dantzig had\r\nrealized the consequences of his unjustifiable retreat to Bilbao, and\r\nmarched up in hot haste with the divisions of Sebastiani and Leval. He\r\nwas relieved to find that Villatte had extricated himself, and resolved\r\nto punish Blake for his unexpected offensive move. But he was unable\r\nto do his adversary much harm: the Galician general had only advanced\r\nin order to save Acevedo, and did not intend to engage in any serious\r\nfighting. When Lefebvre moved forward he found that the Spaniards\r\nwould not stand. Blake had pushed out two flanking divisions to turn\r\nthe position at Guenes, on to which Villatte had fallen back, and had\r\nhis main body placed in front of it. But when Lefebvre advanced, the\r\nwhole Galician army fell back, only fighting two rearguard actions on\r\nNovember 7, in which they suffered small loss. On the next day there\r\nwas a more serious engagement of the same sort at Valmaceda, to which\r\nthe Galicians had withdrawn on the previous night. The troops with\r\nwhich Blake covered his retreat were hustled out of the town with the\r\nloss of 150 killed and wounded, and 600 missing[439]. In his dispatches\r\nthe Spanish general explains that he retreated not because he could\r\nnot have made a better resistance, but because he had used up all his\r\nprovisions, and was prevented by the bad weather and the state of the\r\nroads from drawing further supplies from Santander and Reynosa, the\r\ntwo nearest points at which they could be procured. For Western Biscay\r\nhad been eaten bare by the large forces that had been crossing and\r\nre-crossing it during the last two months, and was absolutely incapable\r\nof feeding the army for a single day. The men too were in a wretched\r\ncondition, not only from hunger[440] but from bad equipment: hardly\r\nany of them had received great-coats, their shoes were worn out, and\r\nsickness was very prevalent. An appreciable number of the raw Galician\r\nand Asturian levies deserted during the miserable retreat from Guenes\r\nand Valmaceda to Espinosa de los Monteros, the next point on the\r\nBilbao-Reynosa road at which Blake stood at bay. When he reached that\r\nplace he was short of some 6,000 men, less from losses in battle than\r\nfrom wholesale straggling. Moreover he was for the moment deprived of\r\nthe aid of the greater part of one of his divisions. This was the 4th\r\nGalician division, that of General Carbajal: it had formed the extreme\r\nleft of the army, and had lain nearest to the sea during the fighting\r\nabout Guenes and Valmaceda. Cut off from the main body, a large portion\r\nof it had retreated by the coast-road towards Santander, and only a\r\nfraction of it had rejoined the commander-in-chief[441]. The total of\r\nBlake’s forces would have been nearly 40,000[442], if his army had been\r\nstill at the strength with which each corps started on the campaign.\r\nBut for its decisive battle he had no more than 23,000 in hand.\r\n\r\n  [439] This engagement, unmentioned by Napier, Thiers, and most\r\n  other historians, will be found in detail in Carroll’s dispatch\r\n  and Arteche (iii. 273, 274).\r\n\r\n  [440] Indeed they were only saved from starvation by receiving\r\n  at Espinosa 250 mules laden with biscuit, from English ships at\r\n  Santander, which General Leith had pushed across the mountains.\r\n  Blake in a letter of Nov. 9 to Leith (Record Office) acknowledges\r\n  that this kept his men alive.\r\n\r\n  [441] I gather from a comparison of the muster-rolls of the\r\n  Galician army in October and in December, that four battalions\r\n  rejoined Blake and six escaped towards Santander.\r\n\r\n  [442] He had originally (see the table on p. 403)--\r\n    Galician troops (four divisions and two brigades)          23,313\r\n    The Asturian Division of Acevedo                            7,633\r\n    La Romana’s troops from the Baltic (the infantry only)      5,294\r\n    Cavalry and artillery (400 and 1,000 respectively)          1,400\r\n                                                               ------\r\n                                                               37,640\r\n\r\n  From this have to be deducted--\r\n    Losses in battle and by desertion                           6,000\r\n    The cavalry, all the artillery save one battery, and\r\n      two battalions guarding the same, all still to the\r\n      rear towards Reynosa                                      2,400\r\n    Two battalions of regiment Del Rey with Malaspina,\r\n      at Villarcayo                                             1,000\r\n    Part of the 4th Division, cut off and retreating on\r\n       Santander                                                2,200\r\n                                                               ------\r\n                                                               11,600\r\n\r\n  This leaves 26,040 available at Espinosa; the real figure was\r\n  probably somewhat smaller.\r\n\r\nBeyond Valmaceda he had been pursued no longer by Lefebvre, but by\r\nVictor. The latter, soundly rebuked by the Emperor for his inactivity\r\non November 5, had advanced again from Orduña, had picked up the\r\ndivision of Villatte--which properly belonged to his corps--and had\r\nthen taken the lead in pressing Blake. Lefebvre, reduced to his\r\noriginal force--the 13,000 men of Sebastiani and Leval, followed as\r\nfar as the end of the defile of El Berron, and then turned off by a\r\nflanking road which reaches the upper valley of the Ebro at Medina\r\nde Pomar. He intended to strike at Villarcayo and Reynosa, and to\r\nintercept Blake’s retreat at one of these two points. If he arrived\r\nthere before the Galicians, who would be delayed by the necessity of\r\nfighting continual rearguard actions with Victor, he hoped that the\r\nwhole of the Spanish army might be surrounded and captured.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Battle of Espinosa. November 11th, 1808.]\r\n\r\nIn this expectation he was disappointed, for matters came to a head\r\nbefore he was near enough to exercise any influence on the approaching\r\nbattle. On November 10 Blake turned to bay: his rearguard, composed of\r\nthe troops from the Baltic, had been so much harassed and detained by\r\nthe incessant attacks of Victor’s leading division, that its commander,\r\nthe Conde de San Roman, sent to the general to ask for aid. Unless\r\nsupported by more troops he would be surrounded and cut off. Tempted\r\nby the strong defensive position in front of the picturesque old town\r\nof Espinosa de los Monteros, Blake directed the rearguard to take\r\npost there, and brought up the whole of the rest of his army into\r\nline with them. At this point the high-road along the river Trueba,\r\nafter passing through a small plain (the Campo de Pedralva), reaches a\r\ndefile almost blocked by the little town of Espinosa, for steep hills\r\ndescending from each flank narrow the breadth of the passage to half\r\na mile. Here Blake occupied a semicircular position of considerable\r\nstrength. The troops of San Roman took post at its southern end, on\r\na hill above the high-road, and close to the river’s edge. The line\r\nwas prolonged to the north of them, across the narrow space of level\r\nground, by the Vanguard Brigade (Mendizabal) and the 3rd Division\r\n(Riquelme). Where the ground begins to rise again lay the 1st Division\r\n(Figueroa), and on the extreme left, far to the north, the Asturians\r\nof Acevedo occupied a lofty ridge called Las Peñucas. Here they were\r\nso strongly placed that it seemed unlikely that they could either be\r\nturned or dislodged by a frontal attack. The rest of the army formed a\r\nsecond line: the Reserve Brigade (Mahy) was in the rear of the centre,\r\nin the suburb of Espinosa. The 2nd Division (Martinengo) and the small\r\nremains of the 4th Division lay behind San Roman, near the Trueba, to\r\nsupport the right wing, along the line of the high-road. The whole\r\namounted to something between 22,000 and 23,000 men, but there were\r\nonly six guns with the army--the same light battery which had fought\r\nat Zornoza. They were posted on the right-centre, with Mendizabal’s\r\nbrigade, in a position from which they could sweep the level ground in\r\nfront of Espinosa. Blake also called up to his aid the one outlying\r\nforce that was within reach, a brigade under General Malaspina, which\r\nlay at Villarcayo, guarding the dépôt which had been there established.\r\nBut these 2,500 men and the six guns which they had with them were\r\nprevented, as we shall see, from reaching the field[443].\r\n\r\n  [443] Malaspina had two battalions of Del Rey, and the Betanzos\r\n  and Monterrey militia. (Journal of Blake’s Operations in the\r\n  _Vaughan Papers_.)\r\n\r\nThe position of Espinosa was most defensible: its projecting wings\r\nwere each strong, and its centre, drawn far back, could not prudently\r\nbe attacked as long as the flanking heights were in the hands of the\r\nSpaniards. But the pursuing French were under the impression that the\r\nGalician army was so thoroughly demoralized, and worn out by hunger\r\nand cold, that it would not stand. Victor had with him the infantry of\r\nhis own corps, some 21,000 strong: Villatte’s division, which led the\r\npursuit, dashed at the enemy as soon as it came upon the field. Six\r\nbattalions drew up opposite the Spanish centre, to contain any sally\r\nthat it might make, while the other six swerved to the left and made\r\na desperate attack on the division from the Baltic, which held the\r\nheights immediately above the banks of the Trueba[444]. San Roman’s\r\ntroops, the pick of the Spanish army, made a fine defence, and after\r\ntwo hours of hard fighting retained their position.\r\n\r\n  [444] Puthod’s brigade of Villatte’s division, the 94th and 95th\r\n  of the Line.\r\n\r\nAt this moment--it was about three o’clock in the short winter\r\nafternoon--Victor himself came on the scene, bringing with him\r\nhis other two divisions, the twenty-two battalions of Ruffin and\r\nLapisse. The Marshal was anxious to vindicate himself from the\r\ncharge of slackness which his master had made against him for his\r\nconduct on November 5, and pushed his men hastily to the front. Nine\r\nfresh battalions--a brigade of Ruffin’s and a regiment of Lapisse’s\r\ndivision--attacked again the heights from which Villatte had been\r\nrepulsed[445]. There followed a very fierce fight, and Blake only\r\nsucceeded in holding his ground by bringing up to the aid of the\r\nregiments from the Baltic the whole of his 3rd Division and part of\r\nhis 2nd. At dusk the heights were still in Spanish hands, and Victor’s\r\ncorps was obliged to draw back into the woods at the foot of the\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n  [445] The 9th Léger and 24th of the Line from Ruffin’s division,\r\n  and the 54th from that of Lapisse, each three battalions strong.\r\n\r\nThis engagement was most creditable to Blake’s army: the lie of\r\nthe ground was in their favour, but considering their fatigue and\r\nsemi-starvation they did very well in repulsing equal numbers of the\r\nbest French troops. They were aided by the reckless manner in which\r\nVillatte and Victor attacked: it was not consonant with true military\r\nprinciples that the van should commit itself to a desperate fight\r\nbefore the main body came up, or that a strong position should be\r\nassailed without the least attempt at a preliminary reconnaissance.\r\n\r\nNext day the Marshal, taught caution by his repulse, resumed the\r\naction in a more scientific fashion. He came to the conclusion that\r\nBlake would have been induced by the battle of the previous day,\r\nto strengthen his right, and in this he was perfectly correct. The\r\nSpaniard had shifted all his reserves towards the high-road and the\r\nbanks of the Trueba, expecting to be attacked on the same ground as on\r\nthe previous day. But Victor, making no more than a demonstration on\r\nthis point, sent the greater part of Lapisse’s division to attack the\r\nextreme left of Blake’s line--the Asturian troops who held the high\r\nridge to the north of Espinosa. Here the position was very strong,\r\nbut the troops were not equal in quality to the veteran battalions\r\nfrom the Baltic[446]. When the French pressed up the hill covered\r\nby a thick cloud of skirmishers, the Asturians fell into disorder.\r\nTheir general, Acevedo, and his brigadiers, Quiros and Valdes, were\r\nall struck down while trying to lead forward their wavering troops.\r\nFinally the whole division gave way and fled down the back of the hill\r\ntowards Espinosa. Their rout left the enemy in possession of the high\r\nground, which completely commanded the Spanish centre, and General\r\nMaison, who had led the attack, fully used his advantage. He fell upon\r\nthe Galician 1st Division from the flank, while at the same moment\r\nVictor ordered his entire line to advance, and assailed the whole of\r\nBlake’s front. Such an assault could not fail, and the Spaniards gave\r\nway in all directions, and escaped by fording the Trueba and flying\r\nover the hillsides towards Reynosa. They had to abandon their six guns\r\nand the whole of their baggage, which lay parked behind Espinosa. The\r\nlosses in killed and wounded were not very heavy--indeed many more were\r\nhurt in the hard fighting of November 10 than in the rout of November\r\n11: it is probable that the whole of the Spanish casualties did not\r\nexceed 3,000 men: nor were many prisoners captured, for formed troops\r\ncannot pursue fugitives who have broken their ranks and taken to the\r\nhills. The main loss to Blake’s army came from straggling and desertion\r\nafter the battle, for the routed battalions, when once scattered over\r\nthe face of the country, did not easily rally to their colours. When\r\nBlake reassembled his force at Reynosa he could only show some 12,000\r\nhalf-starved men out of the 23,000 who had stood in line at Espinosa.\r\nThe loss in battle had fallen most heavily on the division from the\r\nBaltic--their commander, San Roman, with about 1,000 of his men had\r\nfallen in their very creditable struggle on the first day of the\r\nfight[447]. Victor’s triumph had not been bloodless: in the repulse of\r\nthe tenth the fifteen battalions which had tried to storm the heights\r\nhad all suffered appreciable losses: the total of French casualties on\r\nthe two days cannot have fallen below 1,000 killed and wounded.\r\n\r\n  [446] It is fair to the Asturians to mention that eight of their\r\n  ten battalions were raw levies; there were among them only one\r\n  regular and one militia battalion of old formation.\r\n\r\n  [447] It is necessary to protest against the groundless libel\r\n  upon this corps in which Napier indulges (i. 257) when he says:\r\n  ‘It has been said that Romana’s soldiers died Spartan-like, to\r\n  a man, in their ranks; yet in 1812 Captain Hill of the Royal\r\n  Navy, being at Cronstadt to receive Spaniards taken by the\r\n  Russians during Napoleon’s retreat, found the greater portion\r\n  were Romana’s men captured at Espinosa; they had served Napoleon\r\n  for four years, passed the ordeal of the Moscow retreat, and were\r\n  still 4,000 strong.’ This is ludicrous: the eight battalions of\r\n  the Baltic division landed in Spain 5,294 strong; a month after\r\n  Espinosa they still figured for 3,953 in the muster-rolls of the\r\n  army of Galicia (see the morning state in Arteche, iv. 532).\r\n  Only 1,300 were missing, so Victor, clearly, cannot have taken\r\n  4,000 prisoners. Captain Hill’s (or Napier’s) mistake lies in not\r\n  seeing that the Russian prisoners of 1812 belonged to the 5,000\r\n  men of La Romana’s army (regiments of Guadalajara, Asturias, and\r\n  the Infante) which did not succeed in escaping from Denmark in\r\n  1808, and remained perforce in Napoleon’s ranks.\r\n\r\nTo complete the story of Blake’s retreat, it is only necessary to\r\nmention that the detached brigade under Malaspina, which he had called\r\nup from Villarcayo to Espinosa, was never able to rejoin. On its way it\r\nfell in with Marshal Lefebvre’s corps, marching to outflank the retreat\r\nof the Galician army. Attacked by Sebastiani’s division, Malaspina had\r\nto turn off and make a hasty and isolated retreat, sacrificing his six\r\nguns. The driving away of his small force was the only practical work\r\ndone in this part of the campaign by the 4th Corps: its long turning\r\nmovement was rendered useless by Blake’s rapid retreat across its front\r\nto Reynosa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII: CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON CROSSES THE EBRO: THE ROUT OF GAMONAL: SOULT’S PURSUIT OF BLAKE\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter resting for only thirty-six hours at Bayonne the Emperor, as we\r\nhave already seen, pushed on to Vittoria, where he arrived on November\r\n6. He found in and about that ancient city the bulk of the Imperial\r\nGuard, his brother Joseph’s reserves, the light cavalry of Beaumont and\r\nFranceschi, and the heavy cavalry of Latour-Maubourg and Milhaud. The\r\ndivisions of Marchand and Bisson, which were to complete the corps of\r\nNey, were close behind him, so that he had under his hand a mass of at\r\nleast 40,000 men. The 2nd Corps, which Bessières had so long commanded,\r\nwas in front of him at Pancorbo, just beyond the Ebro. Victor and\r\nLefebvre, very busy with Blake, lay on his right hand with some 35,000\r\nmen. The troops which had hitherto been under Ney, with Moncey’s\r\n3rd Corps, were on his right--the former at Logroño, the latter at\r\nCaparrosa and Lodosa. They were in close touch with the armies of\r\nCastaños and Palafox.\r\n\r\nAll was ready for the great stroke, and on the day of his arrival the\r\nEmperor gave orders for the general advance, bidding Bessières (whose\r\ncorps formed his vanguard) to march at once on Burgos and sweep out\r\nof it whatever troops he might find in his front. Napoleon imagined\r\nthat the force in this section of the Spanish line would turn out\r\nto be Pignatelli’s ‘Army of Castile,’ but that very untrustworthy\r\nbody had ceased to exist, and had been drafted into the ranks of the\r\narmy of Andalusia[448]. It was really with the newly arrived army of\r\nEstremadura that the 2nd Corps had to deal.\r\n\r\n  [448] See pp. 393-4, and _Nap. Corresp._, 14,443.\r\n\r\nEverything seemed to promise a successful issue to the Emperor’s plan:\r\nthe enemy had only a trifling force in front of him at Burgos. Palafox\r\nand Castaños were still holding their dangerous advanced positions\r\nat Sanguesa and Calahorra. Blake was being pursued by Victor, while\r\nLefebvre was marching to intercept him. The only _contretemps_ that had\r\noccurred was the temporary check to Villatte’s division on November 5,\r\nwhich had been caused by the carelessness of the Duke of Dantzig and\r\nthe unaccountable timidity of the Duke of Belluno. But by the seventh\r\ntheir mistakes had been repaired, and Blake was once more on the run,\r\nwith both marshals in full cry behind him. The Emperor found time to\r\nsend to each of them a letter of bitter rebuke[449], but told them to\r\npush on and catch up the army of Galicia at all hazards. Upon Moncey,\r\non the other hand, he imposed the duty of keeping absolutely quiet\r\nin his present position: his share in the game would only begin when\r\nCastaños and Palafox should have been turned and enveloped by troops\r\ndetached from the central mass of the army.\r\n\r\n  [449] That to Victor will be found in _Nap. Corresp._, 14,445.\r\n\r\nThe total stay of the Emperor in Vittoria covered parts of four days.\r\nAll this time he was anxiously expecting decisive news from Victor and\r\nLefebvre, but it had not yet arrived when he set forth. He waited, also\r\nin vain, for the news that Bessières had occupied Burgos: but that\r\nmarshal did not show the decision and dash which Napoleon expected from\r\nhim: finding that there was infantry in the place, he would not risk\r\nan action without his master’s presence, and merely contented himself\r\nwith pushing back the Spanish outposts, and extending his cavalry on\r\nboth flanks. It is possible that his slackness was due to chagrin\r\non receiving the intelligence that he was about to be superseded in\r\ncommand of the 2nd Corps by Soult, whom the Emperor had summoned out\r\nof Germany, and who was due at the front on the ninth. Bessières was\r\nto be compensated by being given the command of the reserve-cavalry\r\nof the army, five splendid divisions of dragoons, of which four were\r\nalready on the Ebro. But this post, which would always keep him at\r\nthe Emperor’s heels, was probably less attractive to him than the\r\nmore independent position of chief of a corps complete in all arms.\r\nHe was probably loth to leave the divisions with which he had won the\r\nvictory of Medina de Rio Seco. Be this as it may, he was told to attack\r\nBurgos on the sixth, and on the ninth he had not yet done so. On the\r\nmorning of that day Soult arrived, alone and on a jaded post-horse,\r\nhaving outridden even his aides-de-camp[450], who did not join him\r\ntill twenty-four hours later. He at once took over command of the 2nd\r\nCorps, and proceeded next day to carry out the Emperor’s orders by\r\nattacking the enemy.\r\n\r\n  [450] For details of their ride against time, see the _Mémoires_\r\n  of St. Chamans, his senior aide-de-camp (p. 107).\r\n\r\nThe supersession of Bessières was not the only change which was made\r\nduring the few days while the Emperor lay at Vittoria. He rearranged\r\nthe internal organization of several of the corps, altered the\r\nbrigading of that of Moncey, and turned over to other corps most of the\r\ntroops which had hitherto served under Ney, leaving to that marshal\r\nlittle more than the two newly arrived divisions from Germany (those of\r\nLagrange and Marchand).\r\n\r\nThe troops destined for the march on Burgos counted some 70,000 men,\r\nbut only the 2nd Corps and the cavalry of Milhaud and Franceschi were\r\nin the front line. These 18,000 bayonets and 6,500 sabres were amply\r\nsufficient for the task. Behind followed fourteen battalions of the\r\nImperial Guard and the cavalry of that corps, the two divisions of\r\nNey’s 6th Corps, the division of Dessolles from King Joseph’s reserve,\r\nand two and a half divisions of reserve cavalry--an enormous mass of\r\ntroops, of which nearly 20,000 were veteran cavalry from Germany,\r\na force invaluable for the sweeping of the great plains of Old\r\nCastile[451].\r\n\r\n  [451] The figures here given are mainly those indicated by\r\n  Napoleon in his dispatch of Nov. 8 (_Nap. Corresp._, 14,456),\r\n  supplemented from the morning state of the army on Oct. 10:--\r\n\r\n  2nd Corps (Marshal Soult):\r\n    Division Mouton (Merle)                                   6,000\r\n    Division Bonnet                                           4,500\r\n    Division Merle (Verdier)                                  7,000\r\n    Cavalry of Lasalle                                        2,000\r\n  6th Corps (Marshal Ney):\r\n    Division Marchand                }\r\n    Division Lagrange (late Bisson)  }                       17,000\r\n    Cavalry of Colbert (detached at this moment)              2,000\r\n  From King Joseph’s Reserve, Division Dessolles              6,000\r\n  Imperial Guard { fourteen battalions of infantry            8,000\r\n                 { cavalry                                    3,500\r\n  Cavalry Brigade (Beaumont) belonging to the 1st Corps       1,200\r\n  Latour-Maubourg’s Division of Dragoons (six regiments)      3,700\r\n  Milhaud’s Division of Dragoons (three regiments)            2,500\r\n  Franceschi’s Light Cavalry (four regiments)                 2,000\r\n  Lahoussaye’s Division of Dragoons (four regiments)          2,000\r\n                                                             ------\r\n                                  Total                      67,400\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to enumerate the forces opposed to the Emperor at Burgos,\r\nthe disproportion between the two armies appears ludicrous. Down to\r\nNovember 6 the only Spanish troops in that ancient city consisted of\r\ntwo battalions, one from the reserves of the army of Galicia, the other\r\nfrom the army of Castile[452]. They numbered 1,600 men, and had four\r\nguns with them. If Bessières had attacked on the sixth, he would have\r\nfound no more than this miserable detachment to oppose him. But on\r\nNovember 7 there arrived from Madrid the 1st Division of the army of\r\nEstremadura under the Conde de Belvedere, 4,000 foot and 400 horse with\r\ntwelve guns. On the next day there came up the greater part of the 2nd\r\nDivision of the same army, about 3,000 infantry and two regiments of\r\nhussars. On the tenth, therefore, when Soult attacked, Belvedere--who\r\ntook the command as the senior general present--had about 8,600\r\nbayonets, 1,100 sabres, and sixteen guns under his orders.\r\n\r\n  [452] These battalions were those of Tuy and Benavente, the first\r\n  a militia battalion, the second a new volunteer corps.\r\n\r\nDown to November 2 the army of Estremadura had been commanded by Don\r\nJoseph Galluzzo, Captain-General of that province--the officer who\r\nhad given so much trouble to Dalrymple by his refusal to desist from\r\nthe futile siege of Elvas. He had been repeatedly ordered to bring\r\nhis army up to Madrid, but did not arrive till the end of October.\r\nOn the twenty-ninth of that month he marched for Burgos, his three\r\ndivisions, 13,000 men in all, following each other at intervals of a\r\nday. But on November 2 he received orders to lay down his command and\r\nreturn to Aranjuez, to answer some charges brought against him by the\r\nSupreme Junta. No successor was nominated to replace him, and hence\r\nthe conduct of the army fell into the hands of the Conde de Belvedere,\r\nthe chief of the 1st Division, a rash and headstrong young aristocrat\r\nwith no military experience whatever. His family influence had made\r\nhim a general at an age when he might reasonably have expected to lead\r\na company, and he found himself by chance the interim commander of an\r\narmy: hence came the astonishing series of blunders that led to the\r\ncombat of Gamonal.\r\n\r\nBelvedere’s army was still incomplete, for his 3rd Division had only\r\nreached Lerma, thirty miles back on the Madrid road, when the French\r\ncavalry came forward and began to press in his outposts. Clearly a\r\ncrisis was at hand, and the Count had to consider how he would face it.\r\nIsolated with 10,000 men on the edge of the great plain of Old Castile,\r\nand with an enemy of unknown strength in front of him, he should have\r\nbeen cautious. If he attempted a stand, he should at least have taken\r\nadvantage of the ancient fortifications of Burgos and the broken ground\r\nnear the city. But with the most cheerful disregard of common military\r\nprecautions, the Count marched out of Burgos, advanced a few miles,\r\nand drew up his army across the high-road in front of the village of\r\nGamonal. He was in an open plain, his right flank ill covered by the\r\nriver Arlanzon, which was fordable in many places, his left completely\r\n‘in the air,’ near the village of Vellimar. In front of the line was a\r\nlarge wood, which the road bisects: it gave the enemy every facility\r\nfor masking his movements till the last moment. Belvedere had ranged\r\nhis two Estremaduran batteries on the centre: he had six battalions\r\nin his first line, including two of the Royal Guards--both very\r\nweak[453]--with a cavalry regiment on each flank. His second line was\r\nformed of four battalions--two of them Galician: two more battalions,\r\nthe four Galician guns, and his third cavalry regiment were coming up\r\nfrom the rear, and had not yet taken their post in the second line when\r\nthe short and sudden battle was fought and lost[454].\r\n\r\n  [453] Each mustered less than 400 bayonets.\r\n\r\n  [454] To show how strange is Napier’s statement (i. 254) that the\r\n  army of Estremadura consisted of ‘the best troops then in Spain,’\r\n  and that it was therefore disgraceful that they ‘fought worse\r\n  than the half-starved peasants of Blake,’ we may perhaps give the\r\n  list of Belvedere’s little force: it consisted of--\r\n\r\n  1st Division (General de Alos):\r\n    *4th battalion of the Spanish Guards                   }\r\n     One battalion of Provincial Grenadiers of Estremadura }\r\n    *Regiment of Majorca (two batts.)                      } 4,160\r\n    *2nd Regiment of Catalonia (one batt.)                 }\r\n     One company of Sharpshooters                          }\r\n  2nd Division (General Henestrosa):\r\n    *4th battalion of the Walloon Guards                   }\r\n     Volunteers of Badajoz (two batts.)                    }\r\n     Volunteers of Valencia de Alcantara (one batt.)       } 3,300\r\n     Volunteers of Zafra (one batt.)                       }\r\n  Galician troops: Battalions of Tuy and Benavente           1,600\r\n  Cavalry: 2nd, 4th, and 5th Hussars (called respectively\r\n    ‘Lusitania,’ ‘Volunteers of Spain,’ and ‘Maria Luisa’)   1,100\r\n  Artillery: two and a half batteries                          250\r\n  Sappers: one battalion                                       550\r\n                                                            ------\r\n                                 Total                      10,960\r\n\r\n  Only the cavalry and the five battalions marked with a star were\r\n  regulars.\r\n\r\nSoult came on the scene during the hours of the morning, with the\r\nlight-cavalry division of Lasalle deployed in his front. Then followed\r\nthe dragoons of Milhaud, and three infantry divisions of the 2nd\r\nCorps--Mouton in front, then Merle, then Bonnet bringing up the rear.\r\nWhen he came upon the Spaniards, arrayed on either side of the road,\r\nthe Marshal was able with a single glance to recognize the weakness of\r\ntheir numbers and their position. He did not hesitate for a moment, and\r\nrapidly formed his line of battle, under cover of the wood which lay\r\nbetween the two armies. Milhaud’s division of dragoons rode southward\r\nand formed up on the banks of the Arlanzon, facing the Spanish right:\r\nLasalle’s four regiments of light cavalry composed the French centre:\r\nthe twelve battalions of Mouton’s division deployed on the left, and\r\nadvanced through the wood preceded by a crowd of tirailleurs. There was\r\nno need to wait for Merle and Bonnet, who were still some way to the\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nThe engagement opened by a discharge of the two Spanish batteries,\r\ndirected at those of Mouton’s men who were advancing across the\r\ncomparatively open ground on each side of the high-road. But they had\r\nhardly time to fire three or four salvos before the enemy was upon\r\nthem. The seven regiments of cavalry which formed the left and centre\r\nof the French army had delivered a smashing charge at the infantry\r\nopposed to them in the plain. The regiment of Spanish hussars which\r\ncovered their flank was swept away like chaff before the wind, and\r\nthe unfortunate Estremaduran and Galician battalions had not even\r\ntime to throw themselves into squares before this torrent of nearly\r\n5,000 horsemen swept over them. They received the attack in line,\r\nwith a wavering ill-directed fire which did not stop the enemy for a\r\nmoment. Five battalions were ridden down in the twinkling of an eye,\r\ntheir colours were all taken, and half the men were hewn down or made\r\nprisoners[455]. The remnant fled in disorder towards Burgos. Then\r\nMilhaud’s dragoons continued the pursuit, while Lasalle’s chasseurs\r\nswerved inwards and fell upon the flank of the surviving half of\r\nBelvedere’s army. At the same moment the infantry of Mouton attacked\r\nthem vigorously from the front. The inevitable result was the complete\r\nrout and dispersion of the whole: only the battalion of Walloon Guards\r\nsucceeded in forming square and going off the field in some order. The\r\nrest broke their ranks and poured into Burgos, in a stream of fugitives\r\nsimilar to that which was already rushing through the streets from the\r\nother wing. The sixteen Spanish guns were all captured on the spot,\r\nthose of the second line before they had been unlimbered or fired a\r\nsingle shot.\r\n\r\n  [455] As ill luck would have it four of these five battalions in\r\n  the plain were raw levies, the Volunteers of Badajoz (two batts.)\r\n  and of Tuy and Benavente. They had not skill enough even to form\r\n  square.\r\n\r\nBelvedere, who was rash and incompetent but no coward, made two\r\ndesperate attempts to rally his troops, one at the bridge of the\r\nArlanzon, the other outside the city; but his men would not halt for a\r\nmoment: their only concern was to get clear of the baggage-train which\r\nwas blocking the road in the transpontine suburb. A little further on\r\nthe fugitives met the belated battalions of Valencia and Zafra, which\r\nhad been four or five miles from the field when the battle was lost.\r\nThe Commander-in-chief tried to form them across the road, and to rally\r\nthe broken troops upon them: but they cried ‘Treason,’ pretended that\r\ntheir cartridge-boxes were empty, broke their ranks, and headed the\r\nflight. Ere night they had reached Lerma, thirty miles to the rear,\r\nwhere the 3rd Division of Estremadura had just arrived.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was probably using less than his customary exaggeration when\r\nhe declared in his _Bulletin_ that he had won the combat of Gamonal\r\nat the cost of fifteen killed and fifty wounded. It is at any rate\r\nunlikely that his total of casualties exceeded the figure of 200.\r\nThe army of Estremadura on the other hand had suffered terribly:\r\nconsidering that its whole right wing had been ridden down by cavalry,\r\nand that the pursuit had been urged across an open plain for nine\r\nmiles, it may well have lost the 2,500 killed and wounded and the\r\n900 prisoners spoken of by the more moderate French narrators of the\r\nfight[456]. It is certain that it left behind twelve of the twenty-four\r\nregimental standards which it carried to the field, and every one of\r\nits guns[457].\r\n\r\n  [456] It is fair to say, however, that Jourdan asserts that\r\n  their loss was only about 1,500 (_Mémoires_, p. 85). There is no\r\n  Spanish estimate of any authority. Napoleon in his _Bulletin_\r\n  claimed 3,000 killed and 3,000 prisoners, one of his usual\r\n  exaggerations.\r\n\r\n  [457] There were only sixteen field-guns with the army, yet\r\n  Napoleon says that he took twenty-five (_Nap. Corresp._, 14,478).\r\n  If this figure is correct (which we may doubt) there must have\r\n  been some guns of position taken in the city of Burgos. But of\r\n  the twelve flags there is no question: they were forwarded to\r\n  Paris two days later (_Nap. Corresp._, 14,463).\r\n\r\nThe French army celebrated its not very glorious victory in the\r\nusual fashion by sacking Burgos with every attendant circumstances\r\nof misconduct. They were so much out of hand that the house next to\r\nthat in which the Emperor had taken up his quarters for the night was\r\npillaged and set on fire, so that he had to shift hastily into another\r\nstreet[458].\r\n\r\n  [458] _Mémoires_ of St. Chamans (Soult’s senior aide-de-camp),\r\n  p. 110. Compare the _Journal_ of Fantin des Odoards (p. 189)\r\n  for the scenes of horror in and about the town. The scattered\r\n  corpses of Spaniards, cut down as they fled, covered the road for\r\n  half-a-day’s march beyond Burgos.\r\n\r\nThe night of the tenth was devoted to plunder, but on the following\r\nmorning Bonaparte resumed without delay the execution of his great\r\nplan, and hurried out to the south the heavy masses of cavalry which\r\nwere to sweep the plains of Old Castile. Lasalle’s division pushed on\r\nto Lerma, from which the shattered remnants of the army of Belvedere\r\nhastily retired. Milhaud’s dragoons were directed on Palencia,\r\nFranceschi’s light cavalry more to the west, along the banks of the\r\nUrbel and the Odra. Nowhere, save at Lerma, was a single Spanish\r\nsoldier seen, but it is said that some of Milhaud’s flying parties\r\nobtained vague information of the advance of Sir John Moore’s English\r\narmy beyond the frontier of Portugal. His vanguard was reported to\r\nbe at Toro, an utter mistake, for the expeditionary force had not\r\nreally passed Salamanca on the day when the rumour was transmitted to\r\nthe Emperor[459]. There is no sign in his dispatches of any serious\r\nexpectation of a possible British diversion.\r\n\r\n  [459] _Nap. Corresp._, 14,496, contains this false report.\r\n\r\nOn the same day on which the cavalry poured down into the plains of\r\nCastile, the Emperor began also to execute the great flanking movements\r\nwhich were to circumvent the armies of Blake and Castaños and to drive\r\nthe one into the Bay of Biscay and the other against the Pyrenees.\r\nOn the afternoon of the eleventh Soult, with the three divisions\r\nof Mouton, Merle, and Bonnet, and Debelle’s cavalry brigade[460],\r\nwas directed to make forced marches upon Reynosa, by the hilly road\r\nthat passes by Urbel and Olleros[461]. It was hoped that he might\r\nreach Reynosa before Blake, whose retreat towards the west was being\r\nclosely pressed by Victor and Lefebvre. If he failed to catch the\r\narmy of Galicia, the Marshal was to push on across the mountains, and\r\noccupy the important harbour-town of Santander, where it was known\r\nthat British stores had been landed in great quantities. Milhaud was\r\nto co-operate in this movement by sending from Palencia one of his\r\nbrigades of dragoons, to cut the road from Reynosa to Saldaña, by which\r\nthe Emperor considered it likely that Blake would send off his heavy\r\nbaggage and guns when he heard of Soult’s approach[462]. Two days after\r\ndispatching Soult to the north-west, the Emperor gave orders for the\r\nother great turning movement, which was destined to cut off the army of\r\nCastaños. On the thirteenth Marshal Ney, with one division of his own\r\ncorps (that of Marchand) and with the four regiments of Dessolles from\r\nthe central reserve, together with the light cavalry of Beaumont, had\r\nmarched from Burgos, in the wake of Lasalle’s advance. On the sixteenth\r\nhe reached Aranda de Duero, and, having halted there for two days, was\r\nthen directed to turn off from the high-road to Madrid, and march by\r\nOsma and Soria so as to fall upon the rear of Castaños, who was still\r\nreported to be in the neighbourhood of Tudela[463]. If he could succeed\r\nin placing himself at Tarazona before the enemy moved, the Emperor\r\nconsidered that the fate of the Spanish ‘Army of the Centre’ was sealed.\r\n\r\n  [460] This brigade did not properly belong to the 2nd Corps, but\r\n  to Franceschi’s division of reserve cavalry. Lasalle, with the\r\n  proper cavalry division of the 2nd Corps, was being employed\r\n  elsewhere.\r\n\r\n  [461] This was done on November 11, and not (as Arteche says) on\r\n  the thirteenth. The proof may be found in the itinerary given by\r\n  St. Chamans in his _Mémoires_ (p. 110). On the thirteenth the\r\n  Marshal was already at Canduelas, close to Reynosa.\r\n\r\n  [462] _Nap. Corresp._, 14,467 and 14,477. Napoleon to Bessières,\r\n  Nov. 13 (at two, midnight), and to Milhaud, Nov. 16 (at three,\r\n  midnight).\r\n\r\n  [463] These orders will be found in _Nap. Corresp._, 14,489.\r\n\r\nWhile the movements of Soult and Ney were developing, Napoleon remained\r\nat Burgos. He stayed there in all for ten days, while his army passed\r\nby, each corps that arrived pressing forward along the high-road to\r\nMadrid by Lerma as far as Aranda. His advance on the Spanish capital\r\nwas not to begin till he was certain how Blake and Castaños had fared,\r\nand whether there was any considerable body of the enemy interposed\r\nbetween him and the point at which he was about to strike. Meanwhile\r\nhis correspondence shows a feverish activity devoted to subjects of the\r\nmost varied kind. A good many hours were devoted to drawing up a scheme\r\nfor the restoration of the citadel of Burgos: it was the Emperor’s own\r\nbrain which planned the fortifications that proved such an obstacle\r\nto Wellington four years later in September, 1812. It was in these\r\ndays also that Napoleon dictated the last reply sent to Canning with\r\nregard to the peace negotiations that had been started at Erfurt. At\r\nthe same moment he was commenting on the _Code Napoléon_, organizing\r\nthe grand-duchy of Berg, ordering the assembly of Neapolitan troops for\r\na descent on Sicily, regulating the university of Pisa, and drawing\r\nup notes on the internal government of Spain for the benefit of his\r\nbrother Joseph[464]. But the most characteristic of all his actions\r\nwas a huge piece of ‘commandeering’ of private property. Burgos was\r\nthe great distributing centre for the wool-trade of Spain: here lay\r\nthe warehouses of the flock-masters, who owned the great herds of\r\nmerino sheep that feed upon the central plateaux of Castile. There\r\nwere 20,000 bales of wool in the city, not government stores but\r\npurely private accumulations. The Emperor seized it all and sold it in\r\nFrance, gloating over the fact that it was worth more than 15,000,000\r\nfrancs[465].\r\n\r\n  [464] _Nap. Corresp._, 14,465, 14,488-91, 14,472, 14,482, 14,503,\r\n  and 14,499 respectively.\r\n\r\n  [465] For this barefaced robbery see the _Sixth Bulletin of the\r\n  Army of Spain_, published at Madrid on December 14, and also\r\n  Jourdan’s _Mémoires_, pp. 85, 86; cf. Arteche, iii. 325.\r\n\r\nNeither of the flanking expeditions which the Emperor sent out quite\r\nfulfilled his expectations, but that of Soult was worked far more\r\nsuccessfully than that of Ney. The Duke of Dalmatia’s corps marched\r\nsixty miles over bad Spanish roads in three days--a great feat for\r\ninfantry--and reached Canduelas close to Reynosa on November 13. If\r\nBlake had not already been flying for his life before Victor, he must\r\nhave been intercepted. But he had made such headlong speed that he\r\nhad already reached Reynosa only twenty-four hours after his defeat\r\nat Espinosa. He had hoped to refit and reorganize his army by means\r\nof the vast accumulation of stores collected there, for he had left\r\nboth Victor and Lefebvre far behind, and calculated on getting several\r\ndays’ rest. His first act was to begin to evacuate his artillery,\r\nbaggage, and wounded on to Leon by the road of Aguilar del Campo and\r\nSaldaña. He intended to follow with the infantry[466], but on the\r\nmorning of November 14 Soult’s advanced cavalry came upon the flank\r\nof the great slow-moving convoy, and captured a considerable part of\r\nit. The Asturian general, Acevedo, lying wounded in his carriage,\r\nwas slain, it is said, by Debelle’s dragoons, along with many other\r\nunfortunates. Much of the artillery and all the baggage was taken.\r\nThe news of this disaster showed Blake that his only road into the\r\nplain was cut: no retreat on Leon was any longer possible. At the same\r\nmoment the approach of Victor along the Espinosa road and of Lefebvre\r\nalong the Villarcayo road was reported to him. It seemed as if he was\r\ndoomed to destruction or capture, for all the practicable roads were\r\ncut, and the army, though a little heartened up by two days of regular\r\nrations at Reynosa, was in the most disorganized condition. But making\r\na desperate appeal to the patriotism of his men, Blake abandoned all\r\nhis stores, all his wheeled vehicles, even his horses, and struck up\r\nby a wild mountain track into the heart of the Asturian hills. He went\r\nby the gorge of Cabuerniga, along the rocky edge of the Saja torrent,\r\nand finally reached the sea near Santillana. This forced march was\r\naccomplished in two days of drenching rain, and without food of any\r\nkind save a few chestnuts and heads of maize obtained in the villages\r\nof this remote upland. If anything was needed to make Blake’s misery\r\ncomplete it was to be met, at Renedo[467] [November 15], by the news\r\nthat he was superseded by La Romana, who came with a commission from\r\nthe Junta to take command of the army of Galicia. After the receipt of\r\nthe intelligence of Zornoza, the Government had disgraced the Irish\r\ngeneral, and given his place to the worthy Marquis. But the latter did\r\nnot assume the command for some days, and it was left to Blake to get\r\nhis army out of the terrible straits in which it now lay. On nearing\r\nthe coast he obtained a little more food for his men from the English\r\nvessels that had escaped from Santander[468], waited for his stragglers\r\nto come up, and, when he had 7,000 men collected, resumed his march. He\r\nsent the wrecks of the Asturian division back to their own province,\r\nbut resolved to return with the rest of his army to the southern side\r\nof the Cantabrian Mountains, so as to cover the direct road from Burgos\r\nto Galicia. He had quite shaken off his pursuers, and had nothing to\r\nfear save physical difficulties in his retreat. But these were severe\r\nenough to try the best troops, and Blake’s men, under-fed, destitute\r\nof great-coats and shoes, and harassed by endless marching, were in a\r\npiteous state: although they had not thrown away their muskets, very\r\nfew had a dry cartridge left in their boxes[469]. An English officer\r\nwho accompanied them described them as ‘a half-starved and straggling\r\nmob, without officers, and all mixed in utter confusion[470].’ The snow\r\nwas now lying deep on the mountains, and the road back to the plains of\r\nLeon by Potes and Pedrosa was almost as bare and rough as that by which\r\nthe troops had saved themselves from the snare at Reynosa. Nevertheless\r\nBlake’s miserable army straggled over the defile across the Peñas de\r\nEuropa, reached the upper valley of the Esla, and at last got a few\r\ndays of rest in cantonments around Leon. Here La Romana took up the\r\ncommand, and by December 4 was at the head of 15,000 men. This total\r\nwas only reached by the junction of outlying troops, for there had\r\ncome into Leon a few detachments from the rear, and that part of the\r\nartillery and its escort which had escaped Soult’s cavalry at Aguilar\r\ndel Campo. Of Blake’s original force, even after stragglers had come\r\nup, there were not 10,000 left: that so many survived is astonishing\r\nwhen we consider the awful march that they had accomplished[471].\r\nBetween November 1 and 23 they had trudged for three hundred miles\r\nover some of the roughest country in Europe, had crossed the watershed\r\nof the Cantabrian Mountains thrice[472] (twice by mere mule-tracks),\r\nwading through rain and snow for the greater part of the time, for the\r\nweather had been abominable. For mere physical difficulty this retreat\r\nfar exceeded Moore’s celebrated march to Corunna, but it is fair to\r\nremember that Blake had shaken off his pursuers at Reynosa, while the\r\nEnglish general was chased by an active enemy from first to last.\r\n\r\n  [466] Leith, Nov. 16, from Cabezon de Sal (in the Record Office).\r\n\r\n  [467] Not Arnedo as in Napier (i. 257).\r\n\r\n  [468] See letter of General Leith (dated from San Vincente de la\r\n  Barquera, Nov. 17), in the Record Office.\r\n\r\n  [469] General Leith to Sir John Moore, from Renedo on Nov. 15 (in\r\n  the Record Office).\r\n\r\n  [470] It is from that officer’s dispatches alone that we glean\r\n  some details of this miserable retreat. There is nothing of the\r\n  kind in Toreño, Arteche, or any other Spanish authority that I\r\n  have found.\r\n\r\n  [471] Of La Romana’s army of 15,626 men (Dec. 4) about 5,000\r\n  belonged to regiments which had not been present at Espinosa,\r\n  including the battalions of Tuy, Betanzos, Monterrey, Santiago,\r\n  Salamanca, the 3rd Volunteers of Galicia, and the _Batallon\r\n  del General_, the artillery reserve, and a number of detached\r\n  companies that had been left behind at Reynosa, Astorga, and\r\n  Sahagun before Blake marched on Bilbao on October 11.\r\n\r\n  [472] Once between Valmaceda and Espinosa, once between Reynosa\r\n  and Renedo, once between Potes and Pedrosa.\r\n\r\nWhile the unhappy army of Galicia was working out its salvation over\r\nthese rough paths, Soult’s corps had fared comparatively well. On\r\nreaching Reynosa on November 14 the Duke of Dalmatia had come into\r\npossession of an enormous mass of plunder, the whole of the stores\r\nand munitions of Blake’s army. Among the trophies were no less than\r\n15,000 new English muskets and thirty-five unhorsed field-guns. The\r\nfood secured maintained the 2nd Corps for many days: it included, as\r\nan appreciative French consumer informs us, an enormous consignment of\r\nexcellent Cheshire cheese, newly landed at Santander[473]. At Reynosa\r\nSoult’s arrival was followed by that of Victor and Lefebvre, who rode\r\nin at the head of their corps the day after the place had been occupied\r\n[November 15]. There was no longer any chance of catching Blake, and\r\nthe assembly of 50,000 men in this quarter was clearly unnecessary.\r\nThe Emperor sent orders to Victor to march on Burgos and join the main\r\narmy, and to Lefebvre to drop down into the plains as far as Carrion,\r\nfrom whence he could threaten Benavente and Leon[474]. Soult, whose men\r\nwere much less exhausted than those of the other two corps, was charged\r\nwith the occupation of Santander and the pursuit of Blake. He marched\r\nby the high-road to the sea, just in time to see seventeen British\r\nships laden with munitions of war sailing out of the harbour[475]. But\r\nhe captured, nevertheless, a large quantity of valuable stores, which\r\nwere too heavy to be removed in a hurry [November 16].\r\n\r\n  [473] _Mémoires_ of Gen. St. Chamans, p. 111.\r\n\r\n  [474] _Nap. Corresp._, 14,496 (Napoleon to Berthier, from Burgos,\r\n  Nov. 20).\r\n\r\n  [475] Leith mentions this in his letter from Cabezon de Sal, Nov.\r\n  16.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal left Bonnet’s division at Santander, with orders to clear\r\nthe surrounding district and to keep open the road to Burgos. With the\r\nrest of his troops he marched eastward along the coast, trying to get\r\ninformation about Blake’s movements. At San Vincente de la Barquera\r\nhe came upon the wrecks of the Asturian division which Blake had left\r\nbehind him when he turned south again into the mountains. They fled\r\nin disorder the moment that they were attacked, and the principality\r\nseemed exposed without any defence to the Marshal’s advance. But\r\nSoult did not intend to lose touch with his master, or to embark on\r\nany unauthorized expedition. When he learnt that the Galician army\r\nhad returned to the plains he followed their example, and crossed the\r\nCantabrian Mountains by a track over the Sierras Albas from Potes to\r\nCervera, almost as impracticable as the parallel defile over which\r\nBlake had escaped. Coming down on to the upper valley of the Pisuerga\r\nhe reached Saldaña, where he was again in close communication with\r\nLefebvre.\r\n\r\nBlake and his army might now be considered as being out of the game;\r\nthey were so dispersed and demoralized that they required no more\r\nattention. But there was as yet no news of Ney, who had been sent to\r\nexecute the turning movement against Castaños, which corresponded to\r\nthe one that Soult had carried out against the Galicians. Meanwhile\r\nmore troops continued to come up to Burgos, ready for the Emperor’s\r\ngreat central march on Madrid. King Joseph and his Guards had arrived\r\nthere as early as the twelfth; Victor came down from Reynosa on the\r\ntwenty-first[476], and on the same day appeared the division of\r\ndragoons commanded by Lahoussaye[477]. The belated corps of Mortier\r\nand Junot were reported to be nearing Bayonne: both generals received\r\norders to march on Burgos, after equipping their men for a serious\r\nwinter campaign. Independent of the large bodies of men which were\r\nstill kept out on the two flanks under Soult and Lefebvre, Moncey and\r\nNey, there would soon be 100,000 bayonets and sabres ready for the\r\ndecisive blow at the Spanish capital.\r\n\r\n  [476] _Nap. Corresp._, 14,502: on the twenty-first the 1st Corps\r\n  was at Tardajos, outside Burgos.\r\n\r\n  [477] _Nap. Corresp._, 14,501.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII: CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTUDELA\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving narrated the misfortunes of Blake and of Belvedere, we must\r\nnow turn to the eastern end of the Spanish line, where Castaños and\r\nPalafox had been enjoying a brief and treacherous interval of safety,\r\nwhile their friends were being hunted over the Cantabrian Mountains\r\nand the plains of Old Castile. From October 26-27--the days when Ney\r\nand Moncey drove Castaños’ advanced troops back over the Ebro--down\r\nto November 21, the French in Navarre made no further movement. We\r\nhave seen that it was essential to Napoleon’s plan of campaign that\r\nthe armies of Andalusia and Aragon should be left unmolested in the\r\ndangerous advanced position which they were occupying, till measures\r\nshould have been taken to cut them off from Madrid and to drive them\r\nback against the roots of the Pyrenees. The Emperor had left opposite\r\nto them the whole of Moncey’s corps, one division of Ney’s corps (that\r\nof Lagrange), and the cavalry of Colbert and Digeon[478]--in all about\r\n27,000 bayonets and 4,500 sabres. They had strict orders to act merely\r\nas a containing force: to repel any attack that the Spaniards might\r\nmake on the line of the Ebro or the Aragon, but not to advance till\r\nthey should receive the orders from head quarters.\r\n\r\n  [478] Colbert’s brigade belonged to Ney’s corps; Digeon’s\r\n  dragoons were part of the reserve-cavalry of Latour-Maubourg.\r\n\r\nThe initiative therefore had passed back to the Spanish generals:\r\nit was open to them to advance once more against the enemy, if they\r\nchose to be so foolish. Their troops were in very bad order for an\r\noffensive campaign. Many of them (like Blake’s men) had never received\r\ngreat-coats or winter clothing, and were facing the November frosts\r\nand the incessant rain with the light linen garments in which they had\r\nmarched up from the south. An English observer, who passed through\r\nthe camps of Palafox and Castaños at this moment, reports that while\r\nthe regulars and the Valencian troops seemed fairly well clad, the\r\nAragonese, the Castilians, and the Murcians were suffering terribly\r\nfrom exposure. The Murcians in especial were shivering in light\r\nlinen shirts and pantaloons, with nothing but a striped _poncho_ to\r\ncover them against the rain[479]. Hence came a terrible epidemic of\r\ndysentery, which thinned the ranks when once the autumn began to melt\r\ninto winter. The armies of Castaños and Palafox should have counted\r\n53,000 men at least when the fighting at last began. It seems doubtful\r\nwhether they actually could put much over 40,000 into the field.\r\nCastaños claims that at Tudela his own ‘Army of the Centre’ had only\r\n26,000 men in line, and the Aragonese about 16,000. It is probable that\r\nthe figures are almost correct.\r\n\r\n  [479] Unpublished diary of Sir Charles Vaughan, then riding with\r\n  the staff of Palafox.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the generals assumed the responsibility of ordering a\r\ngeneral advance. We have shown in an earlier chapter that after the\r\narrival of the three deputies from Madrid, and the stormy council of\r\nwar at Tudela on November 5, a new plan of offensive operations was\r\nadopted. It was not quite so mad as the scheme that had been drafted\r\nin October, for seizing the passes of the Pyrenees and surrounding the\r\nwhole French army. Castaños and Palafox, it will be remembered, were\r\nto mass the bulk of their forces between Tudela and Caparrosa, cross\r\nthe Aragon, and deliver a frontal attack upon the scattered fractions\r\nof the corps of Moncey at Peralta, Falces, and Lodosa. There would\r\nhave been something to say for this plan if it had been proposed in\r\nSeptember, or early in October; but on November 5 it was hopeless, for\r\nit ignored the fact that 80,000 French troops had entered Biscay and\r\nNavarre since the middle of October, and that Napoleon himself had\r\nreached Vittoria. To advance now was to run into the lion’s mouth.\r\n\r\nThe armies of Andalusia and Aragon were just beginning to concentrate\r\nwhen, on November 8, a dispatch came in from Blake announcing his\r\ndisaster at Zornoza, and his hurried retreat beyond Bilbao. The same\r\nday there arrived a correct report of the arrival of the Emperor and\r\ngreat masses of French troops at Vittoria, with an inaccurate addition\r\nto the effect that they were being directed on Logroño and Lodosa, as\r\nif about to cross the Central Ebro and fall upon the left flank of the\r\narmy of Andalusia[480].\r\n\r\n  [480] The best picture of Castaños’ head quarters at this time is\r\n  to be found in the diary of General Graham, printed in his _Life_\r\n  by Delavoye.\r\n\r\nCastaños, in his _Vindication_, published to explain and defend\r\nhis movements during this campaign, stated that his first impulse\r\nwas to march by Logroño and Haro to meet the enemy, or to hasten by\r\nAgreda and Soria to interpose himself between the Emperor and Madrid.\r\nBut, on second thoughts, he resolved that it was more necessary to\r\nendeavour to beat the French in his immediate front, and that it would\r\nbe better to persevere in the plan, drawn up on November 5, for a blow\r\nat Moncey. A sharp thrust delivered on this point would distract the\r\nattention of the Emperor from Blake, and draw him off the direct road\r\nto Madrid. Meanwhile, however, on November 11 Castaños fell ill, and\r\ntook to his bed at Cintruenigo. While he was thus disabled, the deputy\r\nFrancisco Palafox took the astounding step of issuing orders in his\r\nown name to the divisional generals both of the Andalusian and the\r\nAragonese armies. Nothing like this had been seen since the days in\r\nthe French Revolutionary War, when the ‘Representatives on Mission’\r\nused to overrule the commands of the unhappy generals of the Republic.\r\nBefore the concentration of the armies was complete, the Deputy ordered\r\nthe assumption of the offensive at all points in the line: he directed\r\nO’Neille, whom he incorrectly supposed to be already at Caparrosa,\r\nto attack Moncey at once; bade Grimarest, with the 2nd Andalusian\r\ndivision, to cross the Ebro at Calahorra; La Peña to threaten Milagro;\r\nand Cartaojal, with a small flanking brigade, to demonstrate against\r\nthe French troops who lay at Logroño. These orders produced utter\r\nconfusion, for some of the generals obeyed, while others sent the\r\nanswer that they would not move without the permission of their proper\r\nchiefs, Castaños and Joseph Palafox. The former got his first notice of\r\nthe Deputy’s presumptuous action by letters from La Peña, delivered to\r\nhis bedside, in which he was asked whether he had given his sanction\r\nto the project for crossing the Ebro[481]. As a matter of fact only\r\nGrimarest and Cartaojal moved: the former was sharply repulsed at the\r\nfords opposite Calahorra: the latter, more fortunate, skirmished with\r\nLagrange’s division, in front of Logroño, without coming to any harm\r\n[November 13].\r\n\r\n  [481] See Graham’s _Diary_, p. 280. This is far the best\r\n  authority for the chaotic movements of the Spaniards during these\r\n  weeks. Some allowance, perhaps, should be made for Graham’s\r\n  dislike for the Palafox brothers.\r\n\r\nIt was now three days since the Emperor had routed Belvedere at\r\nGamonal and entered Burgos, and two days since Blake had been beaten\r\nat Espinosa. The conduct of the generals who had charge of the last\r\nintact army that Spain possessed, seems all the more insane when we\r\nreflect on the general condition of affairs. For on the fourteenth the\r\nmad advance which Francisco Palafox advocated was resumed, Castaños\r\non his sick bed not having had sufficient energy to lay an embargo\r\non the moving forward of his own troops. On the fourteenth O’Neille\r\narrived at Caparrosa and drove out of it Moncey’s advanced posts, while\r\nGrimarest and La Peña received new instructions--to push up the Ebro\r\nand attack Lodosa, which O’Neille was at the same moment to assail from\r\nthe other side of the stream. Thus the great river was to be placed\r\nbetween the two halves of the army, which had no communication except\r\nby the bridge of Tudela, far to the rear of both. ‘This seems rather\r\na hazardous undertaking,’ wrote Graham in his diary, ‘affording the\r\nenemy an opportunity of attacking on whichever side of the river he\r\nchooses with superior force.’ But the only thing that prevented it from\r\nbeing attempted was the sudden refusal of O’Neille to advance beyond\r\nCaparrosa unless he were provided with 50,000 rations of biscuit, and\r\nreinforced at once with 6,000 bayonets from the Army of the Centre\r\n[November 18]. As if the situation were not already sufficiently\r\ncomplicated, Castaños had on the preceding day received unofficial\r\nintelligence[482] from Madrid, to the effect that the Central Junta\r\nhad determined to depose him, and to appoint the Marquis of La Romana\r\ngeneral-in-chief of the Army of the Centre as well as of the Army of\r\nGalicia. This really made little difference, as the Marquis was at\r\nthis moment with Blake’s corps (he had joined it at Renedo on the\r\nfifteenth), so that he could not issue any orders for the troops\r\non the Ebro, from whom he was separated by the whole French army.\r\nCastaños remained at the head of the Andalusians till he was formally\r\nsuperseded, and it was he who was destined to fight the great battle\r\nthat was now impending. It is hard to say what might have happened had\r\nthe French held back for a few days more, for now, at the last moment,\r\nJoseph Palafox suddenly harked back to his old plan for an advance\r\non Pampeluna and the roots of the Pyrenees, and proposed to Castaños\r\nthat the whole of the Andalusian army save La Peña’s division should\r\nassist him[483]. Castaños and Coupigny strongly opposed this mad idea,\r\nand submitted an entirely different scheme to the Captain-General of\r\nAragon, inviting him to bring all his forces to Calahorra, and to join\r\nthe Army of the Centre in taking up a defensive position behind the\r\nEbro.\r\n\r\n  [482] By a letter from Lord William Bentinck, at Madrid (see\r\n  Graham’s _Diary_, p. 281).\r\n\r\n  [483] It is most difficult to unravel all these projects and\r\n  counter-projects: I have followed Graham, who was always at the\r\n  side of Castaños, supplementing him with that general’s own\r\n  vindication, and with Butron’s narrative.\r\n\r\nThe two plans were being hotly debated, when news arrived which proved\r\ndecisive. The French were at last on the move, and their columns\r\nwere pouring out of Logroño and Lodosa along the southern bank of\r\nthe Ebro, heading for Calahorra and Tudela [November 21]. On the\r\nsame day a messenger arrived from the Bishop of Osma, bearing the\r\nintelligence that a French corps (he called it that of Dessolles,\r\nbut it was really Ney) had marched up the head-waters of the Douro\r\nto Almazan, and was heading for Soria and Agreda, with the obvious\r\nintention of falling upon the rear of the Army of the Centre. If\r\nCastaños remained for a moment longer at Calahorra, he would clearly\r\nbe caught between the two French armies. He should have retired at\r\nonce in the direction of Saragossa, before Ney could reach him: but\r\ninstead he took the dangerous half-measure of falling back only as far\r\nas the line Tudela-Tarazona. This was a safer position than that of\r\nCalahorra-Arnedo, but still sufficiently perilous, for the enveloping\r\ncorps from the south could still reach his rear by a long turning\r\nmovement through Xalon and Borja.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Battle of Tudela. November 23, 1808.]\r\n\r\nIf the position from Tudela, on the banks of the Ebro, to Tarazona at\r\nthe foot of the Sierra de Moncayo was to be held, the army of Castaños\r\nneeded strong reinforcements, for the line was ten miles long, and\r\nthere were but 26,000 men to occupy it. The Army of Aragon must be\r\nbrought up also, and Castaños wrote at once to O’Neille at Caparrosa,\r\ninviting him to hasten to cross the Ebro and occupy Tudela and its\r\nimmediate vicinity. The dispatch reached the Irish general late on\r\nthe afternoon of the twenty-first, but he refused to obey without the\r\npermission of his own commander, Joseph Palafox. Thus the night of\r\nNovember 21-22 was lost, but next morning the Aragonese Captain-General\r\nappeared from Saragossa, and met Castaños and Coupigny. They besought\r\nhim to bid O’Neille join the Army of the Centre, but at first he\r\nrefused, even when the forward march of Moncey and the flanking\r\nmovement of Ney had been explained to him. He still clung to his wild\r\nproposal for a blow at Pampeluna, ‘talking,’ says Colonel Graham, ‘such\r\nnonsense as under the present circumstances ought only to have come\r\nfrom a madman[484].’ But at the last moment he yielded, and at noon on\r\nthe twenty-second wrote orders to O’Neille to bring his two divisions\r\nto Tudela, and to form up on the right of the Army of Andalusia. When\r\nthe Aragonese host at last got under weigh, the hour was so late that\r\ndarkness was falling before the bridge of Tudela was passed. O’Neille\r\nthen had an unhappy inspiration: he ordered his men to defer the\r\ncrossing of the Ebro till the following morning, and to cook and encamp\r\non the northern bank. Half of the line which Castaños intended to hold\r\nnext day was still ungarnished with troops when the dawn broke, and\r\nsoon it was discovered that the French were close at hand.\r\n\r\n  [484] Graham’s _Diary_, p. 284.\r\n\r\nThe approaching enemy were not, as Castaños and Palafox supposed,\r\nunder the command of Moncey and Ney. The latter was carrying out his\r\nturning movement by Soria: the former was for the moment superseded.\r\nThe Emperor regarded the Duke of Conegliano as somewhat slow and\r\novercautious, and for the sudden and smashing blow which he had\r\nplanned had chosen another instrument. This was Marshal Lannes, who\r\nhad crossed the Pyrenees with the ‘Grand Army,’ but had been detained\r\nfor a fortnight at Vittoria by an accident. His horse had fallen with\r\nhim over a precipice, and he had been so bruised and shaken that his\r\nlife was despaired of. It appears that the celebrated surgeon Larrey\r\ncured him by the strange device of sewing up his battered frame in the\r\nskin of a newly flayed sheep[485]. By November 20 he was again fit for\r\nservice, and set out from Logroño with Lagrange’s division of Ney’s\r\ncorps, Colbert’s light cavalry, and Digeon’s dragoons. Moncey joined\r\nhim by the bridge of Lodosa, bringing his whole corps--four divisions\r\nof infantry and one of cavalry. The protection of Navarre had been\r\nhanded over to General Bisson, the governor of Pampeluna.\r\n\r\n  [485] See Larrey’s _Mémoires de Chirurgie Militaire_.\r\n\r\nLannes met with no opposition whatever in his march to Tudela, and\r\neasily reached Alfaro on the twenty-second. Here he learnt that the\r\nSpaniards were awaiting him beyond the river Queiles, drawn up on a\r\nvery long front between Tudela and Tarazona. On the morning of the\r\ntwenty-third he came in sight of them, and deployed for an attack: the\r\nstate of utter disorder in which the enemy lay gave the best auguries\r\nfor the success of the imperial arms.\r\n\r\nCastaños had placed the troops under his immediate command at Tarazona\r\nand Cascante, which were destined to form the left and centre of his\r\nposition: the remainder of it, from Cascante to Tudela, was allotted\r\nto the Aragonese and to the Murcian division of the Army of Andalusia,\r\nwhich had been across the Ebro in O’Neille’s company, and was now\r\nreturning with him. Till they came up Castaños had only under his\r\nhand two complete divisions of his ‘Army of the Centre,’ and some\r\nsmall fragments of two others. The complete divisions were those of\r\nGrimarest (No. 2) and La Peña (No. 4), each of which had been increased\r\nin numbers but not in efficiency by having allotted to it some of the\r\nbattalions of the ‘Army of Castile,’ which had been dissolved for its\r\nbad conduct at Logroño on October 26. There had at last begun to arrive\r\nat the front a considerable part of the other two Andalusian divisions,\r\nwhich had first been detained beyond the Sierra Morena by the Junta of\r\nSeville, and then kept some time in Madrid to complete their equipment.\r\nTwo battalions of these belated troops had at last appeared on October\r\n30, and ten more had since come up[486]. But the bulk of the 1st and\r\n3rd Divisions was still absent, and no more than 5,500 men from them\r\nhad been added to Castaños’ army. The mixed brigade formed from these\r\nlate arrivals seems to have been under General Villariezo, of the 1st\r\nDivision. The whole force amounted to about 28,000 men, of whom 3,000\r\nwere horsemen, for the army of Andalusia was stronger in the cavalry\r\narm than any other of the Spanish hosts. But of these the Murcian and\r\nValencian division of Roca (formerly that of Llamas) was with O’Neille,\r\nand had not yet reached the field; while five battalions, from the\r\ndissolved Castilian army, were far away on the left in the mountains of\r\nSoria, whither Castaños had detached them under General Cartaojal, with\r\norders to observe the French corps which was coming up on his rear.\r\n\r\n  [486] Of the 1st Division there seem to have arrived one\r\n  battalion each of the regiments Reina, Jaen, Irlanda, and\r\n  Barbastro, and the Jaen Militia. Of the 3rd Division one\r\n  battalion each of Campo Mayor, Volunteers of Valencia, and the\r\n  Militia of Plasencia, Guadix, Lorca, Toro, and Seville (No. 1).\r\n\r\nThe other half of the Spanish army consisted of the missing division\r\nof the Army of the Centre--that of Roca--and the two divisions\r\nbelonging to Palafox--those of O’Neille and Saint March--the former\r\ncomposed mainly of Aragonese[487], the latter almost entirely of\r\nValencian troops. None of the Aragonese reserves from the great camp\r\nat Saragossa had yet come upon the scene. But the two divisions in the\r\nfield were very strong--they must have had at least 17,000 men in their\r\nranks. On November 1 they were more than 18,000 strong, and, two months\r\nafter--when they had passed through the disaster of Tudela, and had\r\nendured ten days of the murderous siege of Saragossa--they still showed\r\n14,000 bayonets. We cannot calculate them at less than 17,000 men for\r\nthe battle of November 23. On the other hand, there were hardly 600\r\ncavalry in the whole corps.\r\n\r\n  [487] But with one Valencian and two Murcian battalions: see\r\n  Appendix.\r\n\r\nIt would appear then that Castaños must have had some 45,000 men\r\nin line, between Tarazona and Tudela, when Lannes came up against\r\nhim[488]. The French marshal, on the other hand, had about 34,000.\r\nOn the difference in quality between the two armies we have no need\r\nto dilate: even the two divisions of the conscripts of 1807, which\r\nserved in Moncey’s corps, were old soldiers compared to the armies of\r\nAragon and Castile, or a great part of that of Andalusia. Moreover, as\r\nin all the earlier battles of the Peninsular War, the Spaniards were\r\nhopelessly outmatched in the cavalry arm. There was no force that could\r\nstop the 4,500 or 5,000 horsemen of Colbert, Digeon, and Wathier[489].\r\n\r\n  [488] The troops should have numbered--\r\n\r\n  2nd Division of the Army of Andalusia [Grimarest] (five\r\n      battalions of regulars, four of militia, and four of new\r\n      levies) about                                              6,000\r\n  4th Division of the Army of Andalusia [La Peña] (seven\r\n      battalions of regulars, three of militia, and three of\r\n      new levies) about                                          7,500\r\n  Mixed brigade of the 1st and 3rd Divisions [Villariezo] (six\r\n      battalions of regulars and six of militia) about           5,500\r\n  5th Division (Murcians and Valencians) [Roca] (eight\r\n      battalions of regulars, two of militia, and seven of new\r\n      levies)                                                    6,500\r\n  Castilian battalions distributed between the other divisions,\r\n      or detached on the left [Cartaojal]                        8,000\r\n  O’Neille’s Division of the Army of Aragon (three battalions\r\n      of regulars, five battalions of Aragonese, and three of\r\n      Valencian and Murcian new levies)                          9,000\r\n  Saint March’s Division of the Army of Aragon (three\r\n      battalions of regulars, one of militia, and ten of\r\n      Valencian new levies)                                      8,000\r\n  Cavalry (3,000 Andalusians, 600 Aragonese)                     3,600\r\n  Artillery                                                      1,800\r\n                                                                ------\r\n                                                                55,900\r\n  Minus the detachment of Cartaojal, about 3,000                 3,000\r\n                                                                ------\r\n                                                         Total  52,900\r\n\r\n  But we must make large deductions for sickness (which had fallen\r\n  heavily on the ill-clothed men), for loss in previous actions,\r\n  desertion, and detachments; e.g. some of Roca’s division were on\r\n  the Lower Ebro.\r\n\r\n  [489] The French army consisted of--\r\n  Moncey’s Corps:\r\n    Maurice Mathieu’s Division (twelve battalions)          7,000\r\n    Musnier’s Division (eight battalions)                   5,500\r\n    Morlot’s Division (six battalions)                      4,000\r\n    Grandjean’s (late Frère’s) Division (eight battalions)  5,000\r\n    Cavalry of Wathier (three regiments)                    1,600\r\n  Ney’s Corps:\r\n    Lagrange’s Division                                     6,000\r\n    Colbert’s Cavalry (three regiments)                     2,200\r\n  Reserve Cavalry:\r\n    Digeon’s Brigade of Dragoons (two regiments)            1,200\r\n  Artillery, &c.                                            1,200\r\n                                                           ------\r\n                                                    Total  33,700\r\n\r\n  These figures are mainly taken from Napoleon’s dispatch, No.\r\n  14,456, of Nov. 8. They do not include the Irish, Prussian, and\r\n  Westphalian battalions of Moncey’s corps garrisoning Pampeluna\r\n  and San Sebastian.\r\n\r\nThe position Tudela-Tarazona, which Castaños intended to hold, is of\r\nenormous length--about ten and a half miles in all. Clearly 45,000\r\nmen in the close order that prevailed in the early nineteenth century\r\nwere inadequate to hold it all in proper strength. Yet if the points\r\non which the French were about to attack could be ascertained in\r\ngood time, the distances were not so great but that the army could\r\nconcentrate on any portion of the line within three hours. But to make\r\nthis practicable, it was necessary firstly that Castaños should keep\r\nin close touch with the enemy by means of his cavalry--he had quite\r\nenough for the purpose--and secondly that he should have all his men\r\nmassed at suitable points, from which they could march out to the\r\ndesignated fighting-ground at short notice. The Spanish troops were,\r\nnow as always, so slow at manœuvring that the experiment would be a\r\ndangerous one, but this was the only way in which the chosen position\r\ncould possibly be held. The ground was not unfavourable; it consisted\r\nof a line of gentle hills along the south bank of the river Queiles,\r\nwhich commanded a good view over the rolling plain across which the\r\nFrench had to advance. On the extreme right was the town of Tudela,\r\ncovered by a bold hill--the Cerro de Santa Barbara--which overhangs the\r\nEbro. Thence two long ridges, the hills of Santa Quiteria and Cabezo\r\nMalla, extend for some two and a half miles in a well-marked line: this\r\nsection formed the right of the position. From the left of the Cabezo\r\nMalla as far as the little town of Cascante--four miles--the ground is\r\nless favourable; indeed, it is fairly flat, and the line is indicated\r\nmainly by the Queiles and its irrigation-cuts, behind which the Spanish\r\ncentre was to form[490]. From Cascante westward as far as Tarazona--a\r\ndistance of four miles or a little over--the position is better marked,\r\na spur of the Sierra de Moncayo coming down in a gentle slope all along\r\nthe southern bank of the little Queiles. The centre, between the Cabezo\r\nMalla and Cascante, was obviously the weak point in the position, as\r\nthe only obstacle to the enemy’s advance was the river, which was\r\nfordable by all arms at every point along this dangerous four miles.\r\n\r\n  [490] The town and the hill, unlike the rest of the position, are\r\n  on the _north_ bank of the Queiles.\r\n\r\nThe disaster which Castaños was to suffer may be ascribed to two\r\nmistakes, one of which was entirely within his own control, while the\r\nother was due to the stupidity of O’Neille. With 3,000 cavalry in\r\nhand, the Commander-in-chief ought to have known of every movement\r\nof the French for many hours before they drew near to the position.\r\nIt would then have been in his power to concentrate on those parts\r\nof the line where the attack was about to be delivered. But instead\r\nof sending out his horse ten miles to the front, Castaños kept them\r\nwith the infantry[491], and the first notice of the approach of Lannes\r\nwas only given when, at nine in the morning, a regiment of Wathier’s\r\ncavalry rode right up to the town of Tudela, driving in the outposts\r\nand causing great confusion. To the second cause of disaster we have\r\nalready had occasion to allude: on the night of the twenty-second\r\nO’Neille had (contrary to his orders) encamped north of the Ebro. His\r\n17,000 men began to defile over the bridge next morning in a leisurely\r\nfashion, and were still only making their way to their designated\r\npositions when Lannes attacked. In fact the Spanish line of battle was\r\nnever formed as had been planned: the various brigades of the Army of\r\nAragon were hurried one after another on to the heights south-west of\r\nTudela, but entirely without system or order: the lower ground to the\r\nleft of the Cabezo Malla was never occupied at all, and remained as a\r\ngap in the centre of the line all through the battle.\r\n\r\n  [491] It is impossible to acquit Castaños of the charge of\r\n  carelessness on this point. Doyle’s letter of the night of Nov.\r\n  22 is conclusive: ‘Not one soldier has been left to observe the\r\n  motions of the enemy, or to check the progress of his advanced\r\n  guard, common pickets excepted, which are pushed a little outside\r\n  the town. I confess I have not a shade of doubt that the enemy\r\n  will attack at daybreak, and confusion must naturally ensue’\r\n  (Doyle’s correspondence in the Record Office). It is seldom that\r\n  a military prophecy is so exactly fulfilled.\r\n\r\nLannes, who was aware that the Spaniards were intending to fight at\r\nTudela, had marched at dawn from his camps in front of Alfaro in two\r\ncolumns. One, composed of Moncey’s corps, with Wathier’s cavalry at\r\nits head, came by the high-road near the Ebro. The other, composed of\r\nthe two independent cavalry brigades of Colbert and Digeon, and of\r\nLagrange’s division, was more to the west, and headed for Cascante. The\r\nMarshal had no intention of attacking the left of the Spanish line in\r\nthe direction of Tarazona, which he left entirely to itself. He met not\r\na single Spanish vedette till Wathier’s cavalry ran into the pickets\r\nimmediately outside Tudela.\r\n\r\nCastaños was in the town, engaged in hurrying the march of the\r\nAragonese troops across the great bridge of the Ebro, when the\r\nfusillade broke out. The unexpected sound of musketry threw the troops\r\ninto great excitement, for they were jammed in the narrow mediaeval\r\nlanes of Tudela when the sounds of battle came rolling down from the\r\nCerro de Santa Barbara. The Commander-in-chief himself was caught\r\nbetween two regiments and could not push his way out to the field for\r\nsome time. But the men were quite ready to fight, and hurried to the\r\nfront as fast as they were able. Roca’s Valencian division (the 5th\r\nof the Andalusian army) had been the first to cross the Ebro: it was\r\npushed up to the Cerro de Santa Barbara, and reached its summit just in\r\ntime to beat off the leading brigade, one from Morlot’s division, which\r\nwas ascending the hill from the other side. Saint March’s battalions,\r\nwho had crossed the bridge next after Roca, were fortunate enough to\r\nbe able to deploy and occupy the hill of Santa Quiteria before they\r\nwere attacked. But O’Neille’s Aragonese and Murcians were less lucky:\r\nthey only succeeded in seizing the Cabezo Malla ridge after driving off\r\nthe skirmishers of Maurice Mathieu’s French division, which had come\r\nup next in succession to Morlot, and was just preparing to mount the\r\nslope. But the position was just saved, and the Army of Aragon was by\r\nten o’clock formed up along the hills, with its right overhanging the\r\nEbro and its left--quite in the air--established on the Cabezo Malla.\r\nThe front was somewhat over two miles in length, and quite defensible;\r\nbut the troops were in great disorder after their hurried march, and\r\nthe generals were appalled to find that the Army of the Centre had not\r\nmoved up to join them, and that there was a gap of three miles between\r\nthe Cabezo Malla and the nearest of the Andalusian divisions. Castaños\r\nperceived this fact and rode off, too late, to bring up La Peña from\r\nCascante to fill the void. Palafox was not on the field: he had gone\r\noff at daybreak (still in high dudgeon that his scheme for an attack by\r\nPampeluna had been overruled) and was far on the road to Saragossa.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that Lannes’ first attack was unpremeditated and\r\nill-arranged: he had been tempted to strike when his vanguard only\r\nhad come up, because he saw the Spanish position half empty and the\r\nAragonese divisions struggling up in disorder to occupy it. Hence came\r\nhis first check: but the preliminary skirmish had revealed to him the\r\nexistence of the fatal gap between the two Spanish armies, and he was\r\nnow ready to utilize it. While Castaños was riding for Cascante, the\r\ndivisions of Musnier, Grandjean, and Lagrange were coming upon the\r\nfield, and Lannes was preparing for a second and more serious attack.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the fortune of the day was being settled on the left.\r\nWhen the army of Lannes appeared in the plain, La Peña at Cascante\r\nshould have marched at once towards the Aragonese, and Grimarest and\r\nVillariezo from Tarazona should have moved on Cascante to replace La\r\nPeña’s division at that place. Neither of them stirred, though the\r\nsituation was obvious, and though they presently received orders from\r\nCastaños to close in to their right. La Peña was the most guilty, for\r\nthe whole battle-field was under his eye: he would not move because he\r\nhad before him Digeon’s and Colbert’s cavalry, and was afraid to march\r\nacross their front in the open plain, protected only by the shallow\r\nQueiles. He had 8,000 or 9,000 Andalusian and Castilian infantry, and\r\n1,500 horse, but allowed himself to be neutralized by two brigades of\r\ndragoons. All that he did in response to the summons to move eastward\r\nwas to send two battalions to occupy the hamlet of Urzante, a mile to\r\nhis right. There was still a space of three miles between him and Saint\r\nMarch. This scandalous and cowardly inaction is in keeping with the\r\nman’s later career: it was he who in 1811 betrayed Graham at Barossa,\r\nand fled back into safety instead of stopping to assist his allies. On\r\nthis occasion he lay for four hours motionless, while he watched the\r\nFrench forming up for a second attack on the Army of Aragon. Cowed by\r\nthe 3,000 dragoons in his front, he made no attempt to march on the\r\nCabezo Malla to O’Neille’s assistance. Grimarest’s conduct was almost\r\nequally bad: he was further from the scene of fighting, and could\r\nnot, like La Peña, see the field: but it is sufficient to say that he\r\nreceived Castaños’ order to march on Cascante at noon, and that he did\r\nnot reach that place--four miles distant--till dusk.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-chief himself was most unlucky: he started for\r\nCascante about noon, intending to force his divisional generals to draw\r\nnear the battle-field. But as he was crossing the gap between O’Neille\r\nand La Peña he was sighted by some French cavalry, who were cautiously\r\npushing forward through the unoccupied ground. He and his staff were\r\nchased far to the rear by this reconnoitring party, and only shook\r\nthem off by riding hard and scattering among the olive groves. Unable\r\nto reach Cascante, he was returning towards Tudela, when he received a\r\nhasty note from General Roca to the effect that the right wing of the\r\narmy had been broken, and the heights of Santa Barbara lost.\r\n\r\nWhen his three belated divisions had appeared Lannes had drawn up his\r\narmy in two lines, and flung the bulk of it against the Aragonese,\r\nleaving only Colbert’s and Digeon’s dragoons and the single division of\r\nLagrange to look after La Peña and the rest of the Army of Andalusia.\r\n\r\nInstead of sending forward fresh troops, Lannes brought up to the\r\ncharge for a second time the regiments of Maurice Mathieu and Morlot.\r\nBehind the latter Musnier deployed, behind the former Grandjean, but\r\nneither of these divisions, as it turned out, was to fire a shot or to\r\nlose a man. While Morlot with his six battalions once more attacked\r\nthe heights above the city, Maurice Mathieu with his twelve attempted\r\nboth to push back O’Neille and to turn his flank by way of the Cabezo\r\nMalla. After a short but well-contested struggle both these attacks\r\nsucceeded. Morlot, though his leading brigade suffered heavily,\r\nobtained a lodgement on top of the Cerro de Santa Barbara, by pushing\r\na battalion up a lateral ravine, which had been left unwatched on\r\naccount of its difficulty. Others followed, and Roca’s division broke,\r\npoured down the hill into Tudela, and fled away by the Saragossa\r\nroad. Almost at the same moment O’Neille’s troops were beaten off\r\nthe Cabezo Malla by Maurice Mathieu, who had succeeded in slipping a\r\nbattalion and a cavalry regiment round their left flank, on the side of\r\nthe fatal gap. Seeing the line of the Aragonese reeling back, General\r\nLefebvre-Desnouettes, to whom Lannes had given the chief command of\r\nhis cavalry, charged with three regiments of Wathier’s division at the\r\nvery centre of the hostile army. He burst through between O’Neille and\r\nSaint March’s troops, and then wheeling outward attacked both in flank.\r\nThis assault was decisive. The whole mass dispersed among the olive\r\ngroves, irrigation-cuts, and stone fences which cover the plain to the\r\nsouth of Tudela. A few battalions kept their ranks and formed a sort of\r\nrearguard, but the main part of Roca’s, Saint March’s, and O’Neille’s\r\nlevies fled straight before them till the dusk fell, and far into the\r\nnight. Some of them got to Saragossa next day, though the distance was\r\nover fifty miles.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile La Peña’s futile operations in front of Cascante had gone\r\non all through the afternoon. He had at first nothing but cavalry in\r\nfront of him, but about three o’clock Lagrange’s division, which had\r\nbeen the last to arrive on the field of all the French army, appeared\r\nin his direction. Its leading brigade marched into the gap, wheeled\r\nto its right, and drove out of Urzante the two isolated battalions\r\nwhich La Peña had placed there in the morning. They made a gallant\r\nresistance[492], but had to yield to superior numbers and to fall back\r\non the main body at Cascante[493]. Here they found not only La Peña but\r\nalso Grimarest, and Villariezo’s mixed brigade, for these officers had\r\nat last deigned to obey Castaños’ orders and to close in to the right.\r\nThere was now an imposing mass of troops collected in this quarter,\r\nat least 18,000 foot and 3,000 horse, but they allowed themselves to\r\nbe ‘contained’ by Lagrange’s single division and Digeon’s dragoons.\r\nColbert, with the rest of the cavalry, had ridden through the gap and\r\ngone off in pursuit of the Aragonese. The remaining hour of daylight\r\nwas spent in futile skirmishing with Lagrange, and after dark La Peña\r\nand Grimarest retired unmolested to Borja, by the road which skirts\r\nthe foot of the Sierra de Moncayo. They were only disturbed by a panic\r\ncaused by the blowing up of the reserve ammunition of the Army of the\r\nCentre. Some of the troops took the explosion for a sudden discharge\r\nof French artillery, broke their ranks, and were with difficulty\r\nreassembled.\r\n\r\n  [492] Graham witnessed this and reports in his _Diary_ (p. 285)\r\n  that ‘the two regiments that had been sent down into the plain\r\n  behaved uncommonly well.’\r\n\r\n  [493] I agree with Schepeler and the Spanish witnesses in holding\r\n  that on this side the French did very little; their great\r\n  advance, as Schepeler says, ‘ist nur Bulletinformel und weiter\r\n  nichts.’\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to speak too strongly of the shameful slackness and\r\ntimidity of La Peña and his colleagues. If they had been tried for\r\ncowardice, and shot after the manner of Admiral Byng, they would not\r\nhave received more than their deserts. That 20,000 men, including the\r\ngreater part of the victors of Baylen, should assist, from a distance\r\nof four miles only, at the rout of their comrades of the Army of\r\nAragon, was the most deplorable incident of all this unhappy campaign.\r\n\r\nFrom the astounding way in which the Andalusian army had been\r\nmishandled, it resulted that practically no loss--200 killed and\r\nwounded at the most--was suffered in this quarter, and the troops\r\nmarched off with their artillery and wagons, after blowing up their\r\nreserve ammunition and abandoning their heavy baggage in their\r\ncamps[494]. The Aragonese had, of course, fared very differently.\r\nThey lost twenty-six guns--apparently all that they had brought\r\nto the field--over 1,000 prisoners, and at least 3,000 killed and\r\nwounded[495]. That the casualties were not more numerous was due\r\nto the fact that the plain to the south of Tudela was covered with\r\nolive-groves, and irrigation-cuts, which checked the French cavalry and\r\nfacilitated the flight of the fugitives.\r\n\r\n  [494] The 3,000 men of Cartaojal’s troops, which had been\r\n  detached to watch Ney in the direction of Agreda, were cut off\r\n  from the rest of the Army of the Centre, and ran great risks. But\r\n  they ultimately escaped and rejoined the main body.\r\n\r\n  [495] Only Saint March’s casualties are preserved. They amounted\r\n  to 1,328. Roca and O’Neille must have suffered in proportion.\r\n\r\nLannes, it is clear, did not entirely fulfil Napoleon’s expectations.\r\nHe did not take full advantage of the gap between O’Neille and La Peña,\r\nand wasted much force in frontal attacks which might have been avoided.\r\nIf he had thrust two divisions and all his horse between the fractions\r\nof the Spanish army, before ordering the second attack of Maurice\r\nMathieu and Morlot, the victory would have been far more decisive, and\r\nless costly. The loss of the 3rd Corps was 44 killed and 513 wounded;\r\nthat of Lagrange’s division and the dragoons has not been preserved,\r\nbut can have been but small--probably less than 100 in all--though\r\nLagrange himself received a severe hurt in the arm. The only regiment\r\nthat suffered heavily was the 117th, of Morlot’s division, which,\r\nin turning Roca off the Cerro de Santa Barbara, lost 303 killed and\r\nwounded, more than half the total casualties of the 3rd Corps.\r\n\r\nLannes had carried out indifferently well the part of the Emperor’s\r\ngreat plan that had been entrusted to him; but this, as we have seen,\r\nwas only half of the game. When Castaños and the Aragonese were routed,\r\nthey ought to have found Marshal Ney at their backs, intercepting their\r\nretreat on Saragossa or Madrid. As a matter of fact he was more than\r\nfifty miles away on the day of the battle, and arrived with a tardiness\r\nwhich made his flanking march entirely futile. The orders for him to\r\nmarch from Aranda on Soria and Tarazona had been issued on November\r\n18[496], and he had been warned that Lannes would deliver his blow\r\non the twenty-second. But Ney did not receive his instructions till\r\nthe nineteenth, and only set out on the twentieth. When once he was\r\nupon the move he made tremendous marches, for on the twenty-first he\r\nhad reached Almazan, more than sixty miles from his starting-point:\r\nby dusk on the twenty-second he had pushed on to Soria[497], where\r\nhe halted for forty-eight hours on account of the utter exhaustion\r\nof his troops. He had pushed them forward no less than seventy-eight\r\nmiles in three days, a rate which cannot be kept up. Hence he was\r\nobliged to let them spend the twenty-third and twenty-fourth in Soria:\r\nat dawn on the twenty-fifth they set out again, and executed another\r\nterrible march. It is thirty miles from Soria to Agreda, in the heart\r\nof the Sierra de Moncayo, where the 6th Corps slept on that night, and\r\nevery foot of the way was over villainous mountain roads. Hence Ney\r\nonly reached Tarazona early on the twenty-sixth, three days after the\r\nbattle; yet it cannot be said that he had been slow: he had covered 121\r\nmiles in six and a half days, even when the halt at Soria is included.\r\nThis is very fair marching for infantry, when the difficulties of the\r\ncountry are considered. Napoleon ungenerously ascribed the escape of\r\nCastaños to the fact that ‘Ney had allowed himself to be imposed upon\r\nby the Spaniards, and rested for the twenty-second and twenty-third\r\nat Soria, because he chose to imagine that the enemy had 80,000 men,\r\nand other follies. If he had reached Agreda on the twenty-third,\r\naccording to my orders, not a man would have escaped[498].’ But, as\r\nMarshal Jourdan very truly remarks in his _Mémoires_, ‘Calculating the\r\ndistance from Aranda to Tarazona via Soria, one easily sees that even\r\nif Ney had given no rest to his troops, it would have been impossible\r\nfor him to arrive before the afternoon of the twenty-fourth, that is\r\nto say, twenty-four hours after the battle. It is not he who should be\r\nreproached, but the Emperor, who ought to have started him from Aranda\r\ntwo days earlier[499].’\r\n\r\n  [496] _Nap. Corresp._, 14,489.\r\n\r\n  [497] Ibid., 14,504.\r\n\r\n  [498] Napoleon to Joseph Napoleon, from Aranda, Nov. 27 (_Nap.\r\n  Corresp._, 14, 518).\r\n\r\n  [499] Jourdan’s _Mémoires_, p. 92.\r\n\r\nBlind admirers of Bonaparte have endeavoured to make out a case against\r\nNey, by accusing him of having stopped at Soria for three days in\r\norder to pillage it--which he did not, though he made a requisition\r\nof shoes and cloth for great-coats from the municipality. If he is\r\nreally to blame, it is rather for having worked his men so hard on the\r\ntwentieth to the twenty-second that they were not fit to march on the\r\ntwenty-third: he had taken them seventy-eight miles on those three\r\ndays, with the natural result that they were dead beat. If he had\r\ncontented himself with doing sixteen or eighteen miles a day, he would\r\nhave reached Soria on the twenty-third, but his men would have been\r\ncomparatively fresh, and could have moved on next morning. Even then he\r\nwould have been late for the battle, as Jourdan clearly shows: the fact\r\nwas that the Emperor asked an impossibility of him when he expected\r\nhim to cover 121 miles in four days, with artillery and baggage, and a\r\ndifficult mountain range to climb[500].\r\n\r\n  [500] Ney’s march and its difficulties can be studied in the\r\n  _Mémoires_ of Roca, then a captain in the 2nd Hussars, who shared\r\n  this march with the 6th Corps.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the routed forces of O’Neille, Roca, and Saint March joined\r\nat Mallen, and retreated along the high-road to Saragossa, accompanied\r\nfor part of the way by Castaños; while those of La Peña, Grimarest, and\r\nVillariezo marched by Borja to La Almunia on the Xalon, where their\r\nGeneral-in-chief joined them and directed them to take the road to\r\nMadrid, not that which led to the Aragonese capital. On the night of\r\nthe twenty-fifth the Army of Andalusia, minus the greater part of the\r\nwrecks of Roca’s division[501], was concentrated at Calatayud, not much\r\nreduced in numbers, but already suffering from hunger--all their stores\r\nhaving been lost at Cascante and Tarazona--and inclined to be mutinous.\r\nThe incredible mismanagement at Tudela was put down to treachery, and\r\nthe men were much inclined to disobey their chiefs. It was at this\r\nunhappy moment that Castaños received a dispatch from the Central Junta\r\ndated November 21, which authorized him to incorporate the divisions\r\nof O’Neille and Saint March with the army of Andalusia, leaving only\r\nthe Aragonese under the control of Palafox. This order, if given a\r\nmonth earlier, would have saved an enormous amount of wrangling and\r\nmismanagement. But it was now too late: these divisions had retired on\r\nSaragossa, and the enemy having interposed between them and Castaños,\r\nthe authorization remained perforce a dead letter.\r\n\r\n  [501] Only 1,500 of them, with Roca himself, followed Castaños.\r\n\r\nLannes had directed Maurice Mathieu, with the divisions of Lagrange and\r\nMusnier, to follow the Andalusians by Borja, while Morlot and Grandjean\r\npursued the Aragonese on the road of Mallen. The chase does not seem\r\nto have been very hotly urged, but on each road a certain number of\r\nstragglers were picked up. Ney, reaching Borja on the twenty-sixth with\r\nthe head of his column, found himself in the rear of Maurice Mathieu,\r\nand committed to the pursuit of Castaños. Their vanguard reached\r\nCalatayud on the twenty-seventh, and learnt that the Army of the Centre\r\nhad evacuated that city on the same morning, and was pressing towards\r\nMadrid, with the intention of taking part in the defence of the capital.\r\n\r\nNey, taking with him Lagrange’s infantry and Digeon’s and Colbert’s\r\ncavalry from the troops which fought at Tudela, and adding them to the\r\ntwo divisions of Marchand and Dessolles, which had formed his turning\r\ncolumn, urged the pursuit as fast as he was able. Twice he came up with\r\nthe Spanish army: on each occasion Castaños sacrificed his rearguard,\r\nwhich made a long stand and was terribly mauled, while he pushed ahead\r\nwith his main body. At this cost the army was saved, but it arrived in\r\nNew Castile half starved and exhausted, and almost as much demoralized\r\nas if it had been beaten in a pitched battle. A few days later many of\r\nthe battalions burst into open mutiny, when they were ordered to retire\r\ninto the mountains of Cuenca. But at least they had escaped from Ney\r\nby rapid marching, and still preserved the form and semblance of an\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Napoleon, on his side, had begun to operate against Madrid\r\nwith a speed and sureness of stroke that made futile every attempt of\r\nthe Spaniards to intervene between him and his goal. The moment that\r\nthe news of Tudela reached him (November 26) he had hurled his main\r\nbody upon the capital, and within eight days it was in his hands. The\r\nmarch of the army of Andalusia to cover Madrid was (though Castaños\r\ncould not know it) useless from the first. By hurrying to the aid of\r\nthe Junta, through Siguenza and Guadalajara, he was merely exposing\r\nhimself for a second time to destruction. His troops were destined to\r\nescape from the peril in New Castile, by a stroke of fortune just as\r\nnotable as that which had saved them from being cut off on the day\r\nafter Tudela. But he, meanwhile, was separated from his troops, for on\r\narriving at Siguenza he was met by another dispatch from the Junta,\r\nwhich relieved him of the command of the army of the Centre, and bade\r\nhim hasten to Head Quarters, where his aid was required by the Central\r\nCommittee for War. Handing over the troops to the incapable La Peña,\r\nCastaños hastened southward in search of the Junta, whose whereabouts\r\nin those days of flight and confusion it was not easy to find.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII: CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPASSAGE OF THE SOMOSIERRA: NAPOLEON AT MADRID\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter completing his arrangements for the two sweeping flank-movements\r\nthat were destined to entrap Blake and Castaños, the Emperor moved\r\nforward from Burgos on November 22, along the great road to Madrid by\r\nLerma and Aranda de Duero. His advance was completely masked by the\r\nbroad screen of cavalry which had gone on in front of him. Lasalle\r\nwas ahead, Milhaud on the right flank, and covered by them he moved\r\nwith ease across the plain of Old Castile. He brought with him a very\r\nsubstantial force, all the Imperial Guard, horse and foot, Victor\r\nand his 1st Corps, and the reserve-cavalry of Latour-Maubourg and\r\nLahoussaye. King Joseph and his household troops were left behind\r\nat Burgos, to preserve the line of communication with Vittoria and\r\nBayonne. The flanks were quite safe, with Ney and Moncey lying out\r\nupon the left, and Soult and Lefebvre upon the right. In a few\r\ndays--supposing that the armies of Blake and Castaños fell into the\r\nsnare, or were at least broken and scattered--the Emperor hoped to\r\nbe able to draw in both Ney and Lefebvre to aid in his enveloping\r\nattack upon Madrid. Nor was this all: the corps of Mortier and Junot\r\nwere now approaching the Pyrenees, and would soon be available as a\r\ngreat central reserve. The whole force put in motion against Madrid\r\nwas enormous: the Emperor had 45,000 men under his own hand: Ney and\r\nLefebvre could dispose of 40,000 more: Mortier and Junot were bringing\r\nup another 40,000 in the rear. Omitting the troops left behind on the\r\nline of communication and the outlying corps of Soult and Moncey, not\r\nless than 130,000 men were about to concentrate upon Madrid.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor halted at Aranda from November 23 to 28, mainly (as\r\nit would seem) to allow the two great flanking operations to work\r\nthemselves out. When Soult reported that Blake’s much-chased army had\r\ndissolved into a mere mob, and taken refuge in the fastnesses of the\r\nAsturias, and when Lannes sent in the news of Tudela, the Emperor saw\r\nthat it was time to move. On the twenty-eighth he marched on Madrid,\r\nby the direct high-road that crosses the long and desolate pass of the\r\nSomosierra.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Spaniards had been granted nineteen days since the rout\r\nof Gamonal in which to organize the defence of their capital--a space\r\nin which something might have been done had their resources been\r\nproperly applied and their commanders capable. It is true that even if\r\nevery available man had been hurried to Madrid, the Emperor must still\r\nhave prevailed: his numbers were too overwhelming to be withstood. But\r\nthis fact does not excuse the Junta for not having done their best\r\nto hold him back. It is clear that when the news of Gamonal reached\r\nthem, on the morning of the twelfth, orders should have been sent to\r\nCastaños to fall back on the capital by way of Calatayud and Siguenza,\r\nleaving Palafox and the Aragonese to ‘contain’ Moncey as long as\r\nmight be possible. Nothing of the kind was done, and the army of the\r\nCentre--as we have seen--was still at Tudela on the twenty-third. There\r\nwas another and a still more important source of aid available: the\r\nEnglish army from Portugal had begun to arrive at Salamanca on November\r\n13: its rearguard had reached that city ten days later. With Sir John\r\nMoore’s designs and plans of campaign we shall have to deal in another\r\nchapter. It must suffice in this place to say that he was now within\r\n150 miles of Madrid by a good high-road: the subsidiary column under\r\nHope, which had with it nearly the whole of the British artillery, was\r\nat Talavera, still nearer to the capital. If the Junta had realized\r\nand frankly avowed the perils of the situation, there can be no doubt\r\nthat they would have used every effort to bring Moore to the defence\r\nof Madrid. Seven or eight good marches could have carried him thither.\r\nBut the Spaniards did nothing of the kind: refusing to realize the\r\nimminence of the danger, they preferred to urge on Mr. Frere, the newly\r\narrived British minister, a scheme for the union of Moore’s forces with\r\nBlake’s broken ‘Army of the Left[502].’ They suggested that Hope’s\r\ndivision might be brought up to reinforce the capital, but that the\r\nrest of the British troops should operate in the valley of the Douro.\r\nThis proposition was wholly inadmissible, for Hope had with him all\r\nMoore’s cavalry and most of his guns. To have separated him from his\r\nchief would have left the latter incapable of any offensive movement.\r\nHope declined to listen to the proposal, and marched via the Escurial\r\nto join the main army[503].\r\n\r\n  [502] Mr. Frere to General Moore (from Aranjuez, Nov. 25);\r\n  compare the letter of Martin de Garay (secretary of the Junta) to\r\n  Mr. Frere, dated Nov. 24: ‘If the English troops form a junction\r\n  with the Army of the Left, we compose a formidable body of\r\n  70,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry, a force with which we shall\r\n  be certain of our blow, which we never could be by any different\r\n  conduct.’\r\n\r\n  [503] Morla used many arguments to induce Hope to direct his\r\n  men on Madrid, when the English general rode in from Talavera\r\n  to discuss the situation with the Spanish authorities. Hope, of\r\n  course, pleaded the duty of obedience to his chief.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that the Junta still persisted in the foolish belief that\r\nNapoleon had no more than 80,000 men disposable in Northern Spain,\r\ninstead of the 250,000 who were really at his command. They looked\r\non the French advance to Burgos as a mere reconnaissance in force\r\nmade by a single corps, and in this notion the imbecile Belvedere\r\ndid his best to confirm them, by stating in his dispatch that the\r\nforce which had routed him amounted to no more than 3,000 horse and\r\n6,000 infantry[504]. Instead of calling in Castaños and making a\r\ndesperate appeal for aid to Moore, the Junta contented themselves with\r\nendeavouring to reorganize the wrecks of the army of Estremadura, and\r\npushing forward the belated fragments of the 1st and 3rd Andalusian\r\ndivisions, which still lingered in Madrid, as well as the few Castilian\r\nlevies that were now available for service in the field. Nothing can\r\nshow their blind self-confidence more clearly than their proclamation\r\nof November 15, put forward to attenuate the ill effects on the\r\npublic mind of the news of the rout of Gamonal. ‘The Supreme Junta\r\nof Government’--so runs the document--‘in order to prevent any more\r\nunhappy accidents of this kind, has already taken the most prudent\r\nmeasures; it has nominated Don Joseph Heredia to the command of the\r\narmy of Estremadura: it has ordered all the other generals of the Army\r\nof the Right to combine their movements: it has given stringent orders\r\nfor the prompt reinforcement of the above-named army.... There is every\r\nhope that the enemy, who now boasts of having been able to advance as\r\nfar as Burgos, will soon be well chastised for his temerity. And if\r\nit is certain--as the reports from the frontier assure us--that the\r\nEmperor of the French has come in person to inspect the conduct of\r\nhis generals and his troops in Spain, we may hope that the valiant\r\ndefenders of our fatherland may aspire to the glory of making him\r\nfly, with the same haste with which they forced his brother Joseph to\r\nabandon the throne and the capital of which he vainly thought that he\r\nhad taken possession[505].’\r\n\r\n  [504] Belvedere’s dispatch to the Junta (_Madrid Gazette_ of Nov.\r\n  15).\r\n\r\n  [505] Proclamation of the Supreme Junta, published in the _Madrid\r\n  Gazette_ of Nov. 15, 1808.\r\n\r\nSince they systematically undervalued the number of Napoleon’s host,\r\nand refused to believe that there was any danger of a serious attack on\r\nMadrid during the next few days, it was natural that the Junta should\r\nwaste, in the most hopeless fashion, the short time of respite that\r\nwas granted to them between the rout of Gamonal and Napoleon’s advance\r\nfrom Aranda. They hurried forward the troops that were close at hand to\r\nhold the passes of the watershed between Old and New Castile, and then\r\nresumed their usual constitutional debates.\r\n\r\nThe forces available for the defence of Madrid appear absurdly small\r\nwhen we consider the mighty mass of men that Bonaparte was leading\r\nagainst them. Nearly half of the total was composed of the wrecks of\r\nthe Estremaduran army. Belvedere, as it will be remembered, had brought\r\nback to Lerma the remains of his 1st and 2nd Divisions, and rallied\r\nthem on his intact 3rd Division. The approach of Lasalle’s cavalry on\r\nNovember 11 scared them from Lerma, and the whole body, now perhaps\r\n8,000 or 9,000 strong, fell back on Aranda. From thence we should have\r\nexpected that they would retire by the high-road on Madrid, and take\r\npost in the pass of the Somosierra. But the Estremaduran officers\r\ndecided to retreat on Segovia, far to the left, leaving only a handful\r\nof men[506] to cover the main line of access to the capital. It looks\r\nas if a kind of ‘homing instinct’ had seized the whole army, and\r\ncompelled them to retire along the road that led to their own province.\r\nThe only explanation given by their commanders was that they hoped to\r\npick up in this direction many of the fugitives who had not rallied to\r\ntheir main body (one cannot say to their colours, for most of them had\r\nbeen captured by the French) on the day after Gamonal[507]. At Segovia\r\nthe unhappy Belvedere was superseded by Heredia, whom the Junta had\r\nsent down from Aranjuez to reorganize the army.\r\n\r\n  [506] Arteche says that ‘all the intact troops,’ i.e. the whole\r\n  3rd Estremaduran division, fell back on the Somosierra. But\r\n  this is incorrect, for a dispatch of General Trias (_Madrid\r\n  Gazette_ of November 22) shows that he only took two or three\r\n  battalions to the pass, and even some of these must afterwards\r\n  have gone onto Segovia, for only one Estremaduran corps (the\r\n  Badajoz Regiment) is found in the list of San Juan’s little army\r\n  (Arteche, iii. 496).\r\n\r\n  [507] See Arteche, iii. 321. The fugitives fled so far and wide\r\n  that Blake rallied 157 of the regiment of Tuy at Leon! Leith Hay\r\n  found them all over the country-side on November 15.\r\n\r\nThe other troops available for the defence of Madrid consisted mainly\r\nof the belated fractions of the army of Andalusia, which Castaños had\r\nsummoned so many times to join him on the Ebro, but which were still,\r\non November 15, in or about Madrid. They were supposed to be completing\r\ntheir clothing and equipment, and to be incorporating recruits. But\r\nconsidering the enormous space of time that had elapsed since Baylen,\r\nit is not unfair to believe that the true reason for their detention in\r\nthe capital had been the Junta’s wish to keep a considerable body of\r\ntroops in its own immediate neighbourhood. It was convenient to have\r\nregiments near at hand which had not passed under the control of any\r\nof the generals commanding the provincial armies. There were in Madrid\r\nno less than nine battalions of the original division of Reding--all\r\nregulars and all corps who had distinguished themselves at Baylen[508].\r\nOf the 3rd Division there were two regular and two old militia\r\nbattalions[509]. The remainder of the available force in the capital\r\nconsisted of four battalions of new levies raised in the capital (the\r\n1st and 2nd Regiments of the ‘Volunteers of Madrid’), of one new corps\r\nfrom Andalusia (the 3rd Volunteers of Seville), and of fragments of\r\nfour regiments of cavalry[510]. The whole division, twelve thousand\r\nstrong, was placed under the charge of General San Juan, a veteran\r\nof good reputation[511]. But he was only a subordinate: the supreme\r\ncommand in Madrid was at this moment in dispute between General Eguia,\r\nwho had just been appointed as head of the whole ‘Army of Reserve,’ and\r\nthe Marquis of Castelar, Captain-General of New Castile. The existence\r\nof two rival authorities on the spot did not tend to facilitate the\r\norganization of the army, or the formation of a regular plan of\r\ndefence. Eguia, succeeding at last in asserting his authority, ordered\r\nSan Juan with his 12,000 men to defend the Somosierra, while Heredia\r\nwith the 9,000 Estremadurans was to hold the pass of the Guadarrama,\r\nthe alternative road from Old Castile to Madrid via Segovia and San\r\nIldefonso. These 21,000 men were all that could be brought up to resist\r\nNapoleon’s attack, since the Junta had neglected to call in its more\r\ndistant resources. It is clear that from the first they were doomed to\r\nfailure, for mountain chains are not like perpendicular walls: they\r\ncannot be maintained merely by blocking the roads in the defiles. Small\r\nbodies of troops, entrenched across the actual summit of the pass, can\r\nalways be turned by an enemy of superior numbers; for infantry can\r\neasily scramble up the flanking heights on each side of the high-road.\r\nThese heights must be held by adequate forces, arranged in a continuous\r\nline for many miles on each side of the defile, if the position is\r\nnot to be outflanked. Neither Heredia nor San Juan had the numbers\r\nnecessary for this purpose.\r\n\r\n  [508] These corps were the Walloon Guards (3rd batt.), Reina (two\r\n  batts.), Jaen (two batts.), Corona (two batts.), Irlanda (two\r\n  batts.)--much the larger half of the original 1st Division of\r\n  Andalusia, and all old corps (see the lists in Arteche, iii. 496).\r\n\r\n  [509] The regiment of Cordova (two batts.) and the provincial\r\n  militia of Alcazar and Toledo.\r\n\r\n  [510] Two squadrons each of ‘Principe’ and ‘Voluntarios de\r\n  Madrid,’ one each of Alcantara and Montesa. The whole amounted to\r\n  no more than 600 sabres.\r\n\r\n  [511] Napier’s description of the ‘Army of Reserve’ is very\r\n  incomplete: he says that ‘Belvedere’s army rallied part in the\r\n  Somosierra and part on the side of Segovia. The troops which\r\n  had been detained in Madrid from Castaños’ army were forwarded\r\n  to the Somosierra; those left behind from Cuesta’s levies (the\r\n  Castilians) went to Segovia’ (i. 259). But, as we have seen, only\r\n  one regiment of Belvedere’s men went to the Somosierra, and the\r\n  Castilians (Madrid Volunteers) marched thither and not to Segovia.\r\n\r\nIt was open to Napoleon to attack both the passes, or to demonstrate\r\nagainst one while concentrating his main force on the other, or to\r\ncompletely ignore the one and to turn every man against the other. He\r\nchose the last-named alternative: a few cavalry only were told off\r\nto watch the Estremadurans at Segovia, though Lefebvre and the 4th\r\nCorps were ultimately sent in that direction. The main mass of the\r\narmy marched from Aranda against the Somosierra. San Juan had not\r\nmade the best of his opportunities: he had done no more than range\r\nhis whole artillery across the pass at its culminating point, with a\r\nshallow earthwork to protect it. This only covered the little plateau\r\nat the head of the defile: the flanking heights on either side were\r\nnot prepared or entrenched. They were steep, especially on the right\r\nside of the road, but nowhere inaccessible to infantry moving in\r\nskirmishing order. At the northern foot of the pass lies the little\r\ntown of Sepulveda, which is reached by a road that branches off from\r\nthe Madrid _chaussée_ before it commences to mount the defile. To this\r\nplace San Juan pushed forward a vanguard, consisting of five battalions\r\nof veteran line troops[512], a battery, and half his available cavalry.\r\nIt is hard to see why he risked the flower of his little army in this\r\nadvanced position: they were placed (it is true) so as to flank any\r\nattempt of the French to advance up the high-road. But what use could\r\nthere be in threatening the flank of Napoleon’s 40,000 men with a small\r\ndetached brigade of 3,500 bayonets? And how were the troops to join\r\ntheir main body, if the Emperor simply ‘contained’ them with a small\r\nforce, and pushed up the pass?\r\n\r\n  [512] One battalion of Walloon Guards, two each of the regiments\r\n  of Jaen and Irlanda, and three squadrons of the regiments of\r\n  Montesa and Alcantara, with six guns, all under Colonel Sarden\r\n  (colonel of the Montesa Regiment).\r\n\r\nNapoleon left Aranda on November 28: on the twenty-ninth he reached\r\nBoceguillas, near the foot of the mountains, where the Sepulveda\r\nroad joins the great _chaussée_, at the bottom of the pass. After\r\nreconnoitring the Spanish position, he sent a brigade of fusiliers of\r\nthe Guard, under Savary, to turn the enemy out of Sepulveda. Meanwhile\r\nhe pushed his vanguard up the defile, to look for the position of San\r\nJuan. Savary’s battalions failed to dislodge Sarden’s detachment before\r\nnightfall: behind the walls of the town the Spaniards stood firm, and\r\nafter losing sixty or seventy men Savary drew off. His attack was not\r\nreally necessary, for the moment that the Emperor had seized the exit\r\nof the defile, the force at Sepulveda, on its cross-road, was cut off\r\nfrom any possibility of rejoining its commander-in-chief, and stood\r\nin a very compromised position. Realizing this fact, Colonel Sarden\r\nretreated in the night, passed cautiously along the foot of the hills,\r\nand fell back on the Estremaduran army at Segovia. The only result,\r\ntherefore, of San Juan’s having made this detachment to threaten the\r\nEmperor’s flank, was that he had deprived himself of the services of a\r\nquarter of his troops--and those the best in his army--when it became\r\nnecessary to defend the actual pass. He had now left to oppose Napoleon\r\nonly six battalions of regulars, two of militia, and seven of raw\r\nCastilian and Estremaduran levies: the guns which he had established in\r\nline across the little plateau, at the crest of the pass, seem to have\r\nbeen sixteen in number. The Emperor could bring against him about five\r\nmen to one.\r\n\r\nThe high-road advances by a series of curves up the side of the\r\nmountain, with the ravine of the little river Duraton always on its\r\nright hand. The ground on either flank is steep but not inaccessible.\r\nCavalry and guns must stick to the _chaussée_, but infantry can push\r\nahead with more or less ease in every direction. There were several\r\nrough side-tracks on which the French could have turned San Juan’s\r\nposition, by making a long circling movement. But Bonaparte disdained\r\nto use cautious measures: he knew that he had in front of him a very\r\nsmall force, and he had an exaggerated contempt for the Spanish levies.\r\nAccordingly, at dawn on the thirtieth, he pushed up the main defile,\r\nmerely taking the precaution of keeping strong pickets of infantry out\r\nupon the flanking heights.\r\n\r\nWhen, after a march of about seventeen miles up the defile, the French\r\nreached the front of San Juan’s position, the morning was very far\r\nspent. It was a dull November day with occasional showers of rain, and\r\nfogs and mists hung close to the slopes of the mountains. No general\r\nview of the ground could be obtained, but the Emperor made out the\r\nSpanish guns placed across the high-road, and could see that the\r\nheights for some little way on either hand were occupied. He at once\r\ndeployed the division of Ruffin, belonging to Victor’s corps, which\r\nheaded his line of march. The four battalions of the 96th moved up the\r\nroad towards the battery: the 9th Léger spread out in skirmishing order\r\nto the right, the 24th of the Line to the left. They pressed forward\r\nup the steep slopes, taking cover behind rocks and in undulations\r\nof the ground: their progress was in no small degree helped by the\r\nmist, which prevented the Spaniards from getting any full view of\r\ntheir assailants. Presently, for half a mile on each flank of the\r\nhigh-road, the mountain-side was alive with the crackling fire of\r\nthe long lines of tirailleurs. The ten French battalions were making\r\ntheir way slowly but surely towards the crest, when the Emperor rode\r\nto the front. He brought up with him a battery of artillery of the\r\nGuard, which he directed against the Spanish line of guns, but with\r\nsmall effect, for the enemy had the advantage in numbers and position.\r\nBonaparte grew impatient: if he had waited a little longer Ruffin’s\r\ndivision would have cleared the flanking heights without asking for\r\naid. But he was anxious to press the combat to a decision, and had\r\nthe greatest contempt for the forces in front of him. His main idea\r\nat the moment seems to have been to give his army and his generals\r\na sample of the liberties that might be taken with Spanish levies.\r\nAfter noting that Victor’s infantry were drawing near the summit of\r\nthe crest, and seemed able to roll back all that lay in front of them,\r\nhe suddenly took a strange and unexpected step. He turned to the\r\nsquadron of Polish Light Horse, which formed his escort for the day,\r\nand bade them prepare to charge the Spanish battery at the top of the\r\npass. It appeared a perfectly insane order, for the Poles were not 100\r\nstrong[513]: they could only advance along the road four abreast, and\r\nthen they would be exposed for some 400 yards to the converging fire of\r\nsixteen guns. Clearly the head of the charging column would be vowed to\r\ndestruction, and not a man would escape if the infantry supports of the\r\nbattery stood firm. But Bonaparte cared nothing for the lives of the\r\nunfortunate troopers who would form the forlorn hope, if only he could\r\ndeliver one of those theatrical strokes with which he loved to adorn a\r\n_Bulletin_. It would be tame and commonplace to allow Victor’s infantry\r\nto clear the heights on either side, and to compel the retreat of the\r\nSpanish guns by mere outflanking. On the other hand, it was certain\r\nthat the enemy must be growing very uncomfortable at the sight of the\r\nsteady progress of Ruffin’s battalions up the heights: the Emperor\r\ncalculated that San Juan’s artillerymen must already be looking over\r\ntheir shoulders and expecting the order to retire, when the crests\r\nabove them should be lost. If enough of the Poles struggled through to\r\nthe guns to silence the battery for a moment, there was a large chance\r\nthat the whole Spanish line would break and fly down hill to Buitrago\r\nand Madrid. To support the escort-squadron he ordered up the rest of\r\nthe Polish regiment and the _chasseurs à cheval_ of the Guard: if the\r\ndevoted vanguard could once reach the guns 1,000 sabres would support\r\nthem and sweep along the road. If, on the other hand, the Poles were\r\nexterminated, the Guard cavalry would be held back, and nothing would\r\nhave been lost, save the lives of the forlorn hope.\r\n\r\n  [513] Seven officers and eighty men, to be exact (see Ségur,\r\n  _Mémoires_, iii. 282). It does not seem to be generally known\r\n  that the Poles were not yet lancers. They were only armed with\r\n  the lance three months later (see _Nap. Corresp._, 14,819, giving\r\n  the order to that effect), and were at this moment properly\r\n  styled _Chevaux-Légers Polonais_ only. Almost every narrative of\r\n  the Somosierra that I have read calls them lancers; Napier is an\r\n  exception.\r\n\r\nGeneral Montbrun led the Polish squadron forward for about half the\r\ndistance that separated them from the guns: so many saddles were\r\nemptied that the men hesitated, and sought refuge in a dip of the\r\nground where some rocks gave them more or less cover from the Spanish\r\nballs. This sight exasperated the Emperor: when Walther, the general\r\ncommanding the Imperial Guard, rode up to him, and suggested that he\r\nshould wait a moment longer till Victor’s tirailleurs should have\r\ncarried the heights on each side of the road, he smote the pommel of\r\nhis saddle and shouted, ‘My Guard must not be stopped by peasants, mere\r\narmed banditti[514].’ Then he sent forward his aide-de-camp, Philippe\r\nde Ségur, to tell the Poles that they must quit their cover and charge\r\nhome. Ségur galloped on and gave his message to the _chef d’escadron_\r\nKorjietulski: the Emperor’s eye was upon them, and the Polish officers\r\ndid not shrink. Placing themselves at the head of the survivors of\r\ntheir devoted band they broke out of their cover and charged in upon\r\nthe guns, Ségur riding two horses’ lengths in front of the rest.\r\nThere were only 200 yards to cross, but the task was impossible; one\r\nblasting discharge of the Spanish guns, aided by the fire of infantry\r\nskirmishers from the flanks, practically exterminated the unhappy\r\nsquadron. Of the eighty-eight who charged four officers and forty men\r\nwere killed, four officers (one of them was Ségur) and twelve men\r\nwounded[515]. The foremost of these bold riders got within thirty yards\r\nof the guns before he fell.\r\n\r\n  [514] All this narrative comes from Philippe de Ségur, who must\r\n  be followed in preference to the 13th _Bulletin_ and all the\r\n  witnesses who allege that the Poles did reach the battery. He, if\r\n  any one, knew what really happened (_Mémoires_, iii. 281-5). His\r\n  account of the whole business is in close accord with that of De\r\n  Pradt, who was also an eye-witness.\r\n\r\n  [515] The frightful proportion of killed to wounded came,\r\n  of course, from the fact that the casualties were caused by\r\n  artillery fire.\r\n\r\nHaving thus sacrificed in vain this little band of heroes, Bonaparte\r\nfound himself forced, after all, to wait for the infantry. General\r\nBarrois with the 96th Regiment, following in the wake of the lost\r\nsquadron, seized the line of rocks behind which the Poles had taken\r\nrefuge before their charge, and began to exchange a lively musketry\r\nfire with the Spanish battalions which flanked and guarded the guns.\r\nMeanwhile the 9th and 24th Regiments on either side had nearly reached\r\nthe crest of the heights. The enemy were already wavering, and\r\nfalling back before the advance of Barrois’ brigade, whose skirmishers\r\nhad struggled to the summit just to the right of the grand battery\r\non the high-road, when the Emperor ordered a second cavalry charge.\r\nThis time he sent up Montbrun with the remaining squadrons of the\r\nPolish regiment, supported by the _chasseurs à cheval_ of the Guard.\r\nThe conditions were completely changed, and this second attack was\r\ndelivered at the right moment: the Spaniards, all along the line,\r\nwere now heavily engaged with Victor’s infantry. When, therefore, the\r\nhorsemen rode furiously in upon the guns, it is not wonderful that they\r\nsucceeded in closing with them, and seized the whole battery with small\r\nloss. The defenders of the pass gave way so suddenly, and scattered\r\namong the rocks with such speed, that only 200 of them were caught and\r\nridden down. The Poles pursued those of them who retired down the road\r\nas far as Buitrago, at the southern foot of the defile, but without\r\ninflicting on them any very severe loss; for the fugitives swerved off\r\nthe path, and could not be hunted down by mounted men among the steep\r\nslopes whereon they sought refuge. The larger part of the Spaniards,\r\nbeing posted to the left of the _chaussée_, fled westward along the\r\nside of the mountain and arrived at Segovia, where they joined the army\r\nof Estremadura. With them went San Juan, who had vainly tried to make\r\nhis reserve stand firm behind the guns, and had received two sword-cuts\r\non the head from a Polish officer. Only a small part of the army fled\r\nto the direct rear and entered Madrid.\r\n\r\nThe story of the passage of the Somosierra has often been told as if\r\nit was an example of the successful frontal attack of cavalry on guns,\r\nand as if the Poles had actually defeated the whole Spanish army.\r\nNothing of the kind occurred: Napoleon, as we have seen, in a moment\r\nof impatience and rage called upon the leading squadron to perform an\r\nimpossibility, and caused them to be exterminated. The second charge\r\nwas quite a different matter: here the horsemen fell upon shaken troops\r\nalready closely engaged with infantry, and broke through them. But if\r\nthey had not charged at all, the pass would have been forced none the\r\nless, and only five minutes later than was actually the case[516]. In\r\nshort, it was Ruffin’s division, and not the cavalry, which really\r\ndid the work. Napoleon, with his habitual love of the theatrical and\r\nhis customary disregard of truth, wrote in the 13th _Bulletin_ that\r\nthe charge of the Polish Light Horse decided the action, and that\r\nthey had lost only eight killed and sixteen wounded! This legend has\r\nslipped into history, and traces of its influence will be found even in\r\nNapier[517] and other serious authors.\r\n\r\n  [516] The real course of events is best given by Ségur (iii.\r\n  295), who writes as follows: ‘Pendant que notre charge avait\r\n  attiré sur elle les feux de l’ennemi, le général Barrois avait\r\n  profité de cette diversion. Il s’était avancé jusqu’à le rocher,\r\n  notre point de départ. Là, poussés en avant par l’empereur pour\r\n  recommencer ma charge, treize de ses grenadiers avaient été\r\n  abattus par le feu de la redoute. Alors, rétrogradant derrière\r\n  le roc, il avait envoyé quelques compagnies à l’escalade des\r\n  hauteurs à notre droite, puis lui-même, à la tête de sa brigade,\r\n  y était monté.... Les Espagnols, se voyant près d’être abordés,\r\n  avaient déchargé leurs armes, et, se débandant aussitôt, ils\r\n  s’étaient mis a fuir à toutes jambes. Au même moment à sa gauche\r\n  le bruit de la canonnade avait cessé. C’était alors que le\r\n  régiment entier de lanciers Polonais, recommençant la charge\r\n  prématurée de notre escadron détruit, avait achevé, sans autre\r\n  perte, d’enlever la position. Les canons, quelques officiers\r\n  et 150 à 200 Espagnols seulement purent être atteints, tant la\r\n  dispersion de l’armée devant les quatre bataillons de Barrois\r\n  avait été subite et rapide.’\r\n\r\n  [517] He describes it as if ‘a position nearly impregnable, and\r\n  defended by 12,000 men, had been abandoned to the wild charge of\r\n  a few squadrons, whom two companies of steady infantry could have\r\n  stopped’ (i. 268).\r\n\r\nThe combat of the Somosierra, in short, is only an example of the\r\nwell-known fact that defiles with accessible flank-slopes cannot be\r\nheld by a small army against fourfold numbers. To state the matter\r\nshortly, fifteen battalions of Spaniards (five of them regular\r\nbattalions which had been present at Baylen) were turned off the\r\nheights by the ten battalions of Ruffin: the cavalry action was only\r\na spectacular interlude. The Spanish infantry, considering that there\r\nwere so many veteran corps among them, might have behaved better.\r\nBut they did not suffer the disgrace of being routed by a single\r\nsquadron of horse as Napoleon asserted; and if they fought feebly their\r\ndiscouragement was due, we cannot doubt, to the fact that they saw the\r\npass packed for miles to the rear with the advancing columns of the\r\nFrench, and knew that Ruffin’s division was only the skirmishing line\r\n(so to speak) of a great army.\r\n\r\nOn the night of November 30, Napoleon descended the pass and fixed\r\nhis head quarters at Buitrago. On the afternoon of December 1 the\r\nadvanced parties of Latour-Maubourg’s and Lasalle’s cavalry rode up to\r\nthe northern suburbs of Madrid: on the second the French appeared in\r\nforce, and the attack on the city began.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish capital was, and is, a place incapable of any regular\r\ndefence. It had not even, like Valencia and Saragossa, the remains of\r\na mediaeval wall: its development had taken place in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, when serious fortifications had gone out of date. Its streets\r\nwere broad and regular, unlike the tortuous lanes which had been the\r\nreal strength of Saragossa. Nothing separates the city from its suburbs\r\nsave ornamental gates, whose only use was for the levy of octroi\r\nduties. Madrid is built in a level upland, but there is a rising ground\r\nwhich dominates the whole place: it lies just outside the eastern limit\r\nof the city. On it stood the palace of the Buen Retiro (which gives its\r\nname to the height), and several other public buildings, among them the\r\nObservatory and the royal porcelain manufactory, known as La China.\r\nThe latter occupied the more commanding and important section of the\r\nsummit of the hill. Between the Retiro and the eastern side of the city\r\nlies the public park known as the Prado, a low-lying open space laid\r\nout with fountains, statues, and long avenues of trees. Three broad and\r\nhandsome streets[518] run eastward and terminate in the Prado, just\r\nopposite the Retiro, so that cannon planted either by the palace or\r\nby La China can search them from end to end. This was so obvious that\r\nMurat, during his occupation of Madrid in April and May, had built\r\nthree redoubts, one large and two small, facing down into the city\r\nand armed with guns of position. The inhabitants of Madrid had partly\r\ndismantled them after the departure of the French--and did themselves\r\nno harm thereby, for these earthworks were useless for defence against\r\nan enemy from without: they could be employed to overawe the city but\r\nnot to protect it[519].\r\n\r\n  [518] The Calle de Alcala, Calle de Atocha, and Carrera de San\r\n  Geronimo.\r\n\r\n  [519] This description is mainly from Vaughan’s unpublished diary\r\n  (p. 230).\r\n\r\nEver since the rout of Gamonal, those members of the Junta who were\r\ngifted with ordinary foresight must have realized that it was probable\r\nthat the Emperor would appear ere long before the gates of the capital.\r\nBut to avoid alarming the excitable populace, the fact was concealed as\r\nlong as possible, and it was given out that Madrid would be defended\r\nat the impregnable Somosierra. It was not till November 25 that any\r\npublic measures for the fortification of the capital were spoken of.\r\nOn that day the Junta issued a proclamation placing the charge of the\r\ncapital in the hands of the Marquis of Castelar, Captain-General of New\r\nCastile, and of Don Tomas de Morla, the officer who had won a name by\r\nbombarding and capturing the French fleet at Cadiz in June. Under their\r\ndirections, preparations were begun for putting the city in a state\r\nof defence. But the military men had a strong and well-founded belief\r\nthat the place was indefensible, and that all efforts made to fortify\r\nit were labour thrown away: the fight must be made at the Somosierra,\r\nnot at the gates of Madrid. It was not till the news of the rout of San\r\nJuan’s army on the thirtieth came to hand, that any very serious work\r\nwas executed. But when this disaster was known there was a sudden and\r\nsplendid outburst of energy. The populace, full of vindictive memories\r\nof May 2, were ready and willing to fight, and had no conception of\r\nthe military weakness of their situation. If Saragossa had defended\r\nitself street by street, why, they asked, should not Madrid do the\r\nsame? Their spirits were so high and their temper so ferocious, that\r\nthe authorities realized that they must place themselves at the head of\r\nthe multitude, or be torn to pieces as traitors. On December 1 a Junta\r\nof Defence was formed, under the presidency of the Duke of Infantado,\r\nin which Morla and Castelar were given a large and heterogeneous mass\r\nof colleagues--magistrates, officers, and prominent citizens forming\r\nan unwieldy body very unfit to act as an executive council of war. The\r\nmilitary resources at their disposal were insignificant: there was\r\na handful of the fugitives from the Somosierra--Castelar estimated\r\nthem as not more than 300 or 400 in all[520]--and two battalions of\r\nnew levies from the south, which had arrived only on the morning of\r\nDecember 1. The organized forces then were not more than 2,500 or 3,000\r\nin all. But there was a vast and unruly mob of citizens of Madrid and\r\nof peasants, who had flocked into the city to aid in its defence.\r\nWeapons rather than men were wanting, for when 8,000 muskets from the\r\nArsenal had been served out, the supply ran short. All private persons\r\nowning firearms of any description were invited to hand them in to the\r\nJunta: but this resource soon failed, and finally pikes were served\r\nout, and even mediaeval weapons from the royal armoury and the family\r\ncollections of certain grandees. How many men, armed in one way or\r\nanother, took part in the defence of Madrid will never be known--it\r\ncannot have been less than 20,000, and may have amounted to much more.\r\n\r\n  [520] This must have been an under-estimate. More than 1,500 of\r\n  the Somosierra troops had joined the army of Infantado by the New\r\n  Year.\r\n\r\nNot merely the combatants, but the whole population of both sexes\r\nturned themselves with absolute frenzy to the work of fortification.\r\nIn the two days which they had at their disposal they carried out an\r\nenormous and ill-compacted scheme for surrounding the whole city with\r\nlines. In front of each of the gates a battery was established, formed\r\nof earth reveted with paving-stones: to connect these a continuous\r\nwall was made, by joining together all the exterior houses of the town\r\nwith earthworks, or with piles of stones and bricks pulled down from\r\nbuildings in the suburbs. On several fronts ditches were excavated:\r\nthe more important streets were blocked with barricades, and the\r\nwindows and doors of exposed buildings were built up. There were\r\nvery few engineers at the disposal of the Junta of Defence, and the\r\npopulace in many places worked not under skilled guidance but by the\r\nlight of nature, executing enormous but perfectly useless works. ‘The\r\nbatteries,’ wrote a prominent Spanish witness, ‘were all too small:\r\nthey were so low that they did not prevent the gates and streets which\r\nthey defended from being enfiladed: the guns being placed _en barbette_\r\nwere much exposed, and were dominated by the artillery which the enemy\r\nafterwards placed on the high ground [i.e. the Retiro heights]. The low\r\nparapets and the want of proportion between them and their banquettes\r\nleft the infantry unsheltered: indeed they were harmed rather than\r\nhelped by the works, for the splinters of the paving-stones which\r\nformed the parapets proved more deadly to the garrison than did the\r\nenemy’s cannon-balls. The batteries were too low at the flanks, and\r\nplaced so close to the buildings in their rear that the guns could\r\nnot easily be worked nor the infantry supports move freely. The gates\r\nbehind being all of hewn stone, every ball that struck them sent such\r\na shower of fragments flying that the effect was like grape: it forced\r\nthe defenders to lie flat, and even then caused terrible loss[521].’ It\r\nmay be added that not only were the works unscientifically executed,\r\nbut that the most tiresome results were produced by the misguided\r\nenergy of persons who threw up barricades, or dug cuttings, behind\r\nthem, so that it was very hard to send up reinforcements, and quite\r\nimpossible to withdraw the guns from one battery for use in another.\r\n\r\n  [521] Report on the defences of Madrid, by the Duke of Infantado,\r\n  quoted in Arteche (iii. 400, 401).\r\n\r\nIt was natural that these self-taught engineers should neglect the one\r\nmost important point in the defences of Madrid. The Retiro heights were\r\nthe key of the city: if they were lost, the whole place lay open to\r\nbombardment from the dominating ground. But nothing was done here, save\r\nthat the old French works round the factory of La China were repaired,\r\nthe buildings of the palace, barracks, and hospital in the vicinity\r\nbarricaded, and a low continuous earthwork constructed round the summit\r\nof the hill. It should have been turned into a regular entrenched camp,\r\nif the city was really to be defended.\r\n\r\nThe Junta of Defence did its best to preserve order and introduce\r\ndiscipline: all the armed men were paraded in the Prado, told off\r\ninto bands, and allotted their posts around the circumference of the\r\ncity. But there were many idle hands, and much confusion: it was\r\ninevitable that mobs should collect, with the usual consequences. Cries\r\nof ‘Treason’ were raised, some houses were sacked, and at least one\r\natrocious murder was committed. The Marquis of Perales was president\r\nof the sub-committee which the Junta had appointed to superintend the\r\nmanufacture and distribution of ammunition. Among the cartridges given\r\nout to the people some were found in which sand had been substituted\r\nfor powder--probably they were relics of some petty piece of peculation\r\ndating back to the times of Godoy. When this was discovered, a furious\r\nmob ran to the house of the marquis, beat him to death, and dragged his\r\ncorpse through the streets on a hurdle[522].\r\n\r\n  [522] Napier calls Perales ‘a respectable old general’; but as\r\n  Toreño remarks (i. 305), he was neither old, nor a military\r\n  officer of any rank, nor respectable. He was a man of fashion\r\n  noted for his licentious life, and the mob which murdered him\r\n  is said to have been headed by his discarded mistress. Arteche\r\n  suggests that the sand-cartridges were constructed for the\r\n  purpose of ruining him, and that the whole business was a piece\r\n  of private vengeance. The marquis had once been a very popular\r\n  character among the lower classes, but had lost credit by showing\r\n  politeness to Murat.\r\n\r\nIf the populace of Madrid was full of blind self-confidence, and\r\nimagined that it had the power to beat off the assault of Napoleon, its\r\nleaders were in a much more despondent frame of mind. Morla was one of\r\nthose who had joined the patriotic party merely because he thought it\r\nwas the winning side: he was deeply disgusted with himself, and was\r\nalready contemplating the traitorous desertion to the enemy which has\r\ncovered his name with eternal disgrace. Castelar seems to have been\r\nweak and downhearted. The Duke of Infantado was enough of a soldier\r\nto see the hopeless inefficiency of the measures of defence which had\r\nbeen adopted. The only chance of saving Madrid was to hurry up to its\r\naid the two field-armies which were within touch--the old Andalusian\r\ndivisions (now under La Peña), which, by orders of the Supreme Junta,\r\nwere marching from Calatayud on the capital, and the routed bands of\r\nHeredia and San Juan at Segovia. Urgent appeals were sent to both of\r\nthese hosts to press forward without delay: Infantado himself rode out\r\nto meet the army of the Centre, which on this day [Dec. 1] had not long\r\npassed Siguenza in its retreat, and was still nearly eighty miles from\r\nthe capital. He met it at Guadalajara on the next day, in very bad\r\ncondition, and much reduced by long marches and starvation: with the\r\ncolours there were only 9,000 foot and 2,000 horse, and these were in\r\na state of half-developed mutiny. The rest of the 20,000 men who had\r\nescaped from Tudela were ranging in small bands over the country-side,\r\nin search of food, and were not rallied for many days. There was not\r\nmuch to be hoped for from the army of the Centre, and it was evident\r\nthat it could not reach Madrid till December 3 or 4. The troops of San\r\nJuan and Heredia were not so far distant, but even they had fifty-five\r\nmiles to march from Segovia, and--as it turned out--the capital had\r\nfallen before either of the field-armies could possibly come to its\r\naid. Still more fruitless were the attempts made at the last moment to\r\ninduce Sir John Moore to bring up the British expeditionary force from\r\nSalamanca--he was 150 miles away, and could not have arrived before\r\nDecember 7, three days after the capitulation had been signed.\r\n\r\nNapoleon dealt with the insurgents of Madrid in a very summary manner.\r\nOn December 1--as we have already seen--his vedettes appeared before\r\nthe city: on the morning of the second the dragoons of Lahoussaye and\r\nLatour-Maubourg came up in force and invested the northern and eastern\r\nfronts of the city. At noon the Emperor himself appeared, and late in\r\nthe afternoon the infantry columns of Victor’s corps. December 2 was\r\none of Bonaparte’s lucky days, being the anniversary of Austerlitz, and\r\nhe had indulged in a faint hope that an open town like the Spanish\r\ncapital might do him the courtesy of surrendering without a blow,\r\nlike Vienna in 1805, or Berlin in 1806. Accordingly he sent a summons\r\nto the Junta in the afternoon; but the Spaniards were in no mood for\r\nyielding. General Montbrun, who rode up to the gates with the white\r\nflag, was nearly mobbed by enraged peasants, and the aide-de-camp who\r\ntook the dispatch into the city was only saved from certain death by\r\nthe exertions of some Spanish officers of the line. The Junta sent him\r\nback with the haughty reply that ‘the people of Madrid were resolved to\r\nbury themselves under the ruins of their houses rather than to permit\r\nthe French troops to enter their city.’\r\n\r\nSince the ‘sun of Austerlitz’ was not destined to set upon the\r\ntriumphal entry of the Emperor into the Spanish capital, it became\r\nnecessary to prepare for the use of force. As a preliminary for an\r\nattack on the following morning, Lapisse’s division of Victor’s corps\r\nwas sent forward to turn the Spaniards out of many isolated houses in\r\nfront of their line of entrenchments, which were being held as advanced\r\nposts. The ground being cleared, preparations could be made for the\r\nassault. The moment that Bonaparte cast eyes on the place, he realized\r\nthat the heights of the Retiro were the key of the position. Under\r\ncover of the night, therefore, thirty guns were ranged in line opposite\r\nthe weak earthworks which crowned the eminence. Artillery in smaller\r\nforce was placed in front of several of the northern and eastern\r\ngates of the city, to distract the attention of the garrison from the\r\ncritical point. Before dawn the Emperor sent in another summons to\r\nsurrender, by the hands of an artillery officer who had been captured\r\nat the Somosierra. It is clear that he wished, if possible, to enter\r\nMadrid without being obliged to deliver up the city to fire and sword:\r\nit would be unfortunate if his brother’s second reign were to begin\r\nunder such unhappy conditions. But it is hard to understand how he\r\ncould suppose that the warlike frenzy of the Spaniards would have died\r\ndown between the afternoon of December 2 and the dawn of December 3.\r\nAll the reply that he obtained was a proposal from the Captain-General\r\nCastelar, that there should be a suspension of arms for twelve hours.\r\nThe sole object of this delay was to allow the Spanish field-armies\r\ntime to draw nearer to Madrid. Recognizing the fact--which was obvious\r\nenough--the Emperor gave orders for an immediate assault. A cannonade\r\nwas opened against the gates of Los Pozos, the Recoletos, Fuencarral,\r\nand several others on the northern and eastern sides of the city.\r\nConsiderable damage was done to the Spanish defences, but these\r\nattacks were all subsidiary. The real assault was delivered against\r\nthe Retiro heights. The heavy cannonade which was directed against the\r\nSpanish works soon opened several breaches. Then Villatte’s division\r\nof Victor’s corps was sent in to storm the position, a feat which it\r\naccomplished with the greatest ease. The garrison of this all-important\r\nsection of the defences consisted of a single battalion of new\r\nlevies--the Regiment of Mazzaredo--and a mass of armed citizens. They\r\nwere swept out of their works, and pursued downhill into the Prado.\r\nPressing onward among the avenues and fountains, Villatte’s division\r\ntook in the rear the defenders of the three neighbouring gates, and\r\nthen, pushing in among the houses of the city, made a lodgement in the\r\npalace of the Duke of Medina Celi, and several other large buildings.\r\nThere was now nothing between the French army and the heart of Madrid\r\nsave the street-barricades, which the populace had thrown up behind the\r\noriginal lines of defence.\r\n\r\nIf Napoleon had chosen to send into the fight the rest of Victor’s\r\ncorps, and had pushed forward the whole of his artillery to the edge\r\nof the captured heights, with orders to shell the city, there can be\r\nlittle doubt that Madrid might have been stormed ere nightfall. Its\r\nbroad streets did not give the facilities of defence that Saragossa\r\nhad possessed, and the Emperor had at his disposal not a weak and\r\nheterogeneous army, such as Verdier had commanded, but more than 40,000\r\nveteran troops. His artillery, too, had on the Retiro a vantage-ground\r\nsuch as did not exist outside the Aragonese capital. Nevertheless the\r\nEmperor did not press the attack, and once more sent in a demand for\r\nthe surrender of the place, at about eleven in the morning of December\r\n3.\r\n\r\nThe populace of Madrid did not yet recognize its own forlorn state,\r\nand was keeping up a vigorous fusillade at the gates and behind the\r\nbarricades. It had suffered severe loss from the French artillery,\r\nowing to the unscientific construction of the defences, but was not\r\nyet ready to yield. But the Junta was in a very different frame of\r\nmind: the military men thoroughly understood the situation, and\r\nwere expecting to see a hundred guns open from the crest of the\r\nRetiro within the next few minutes. Their civilian colleagues, the\r\nmagistrates, and local notables were looking forward with no enviable\r\nfeelings to the conflagration and the general sack that seemed to be\r\nat hand. In short the idea of rivalling Saragossa was far from their\r\nthoughts. When Napoleon’s letter, offering ‘pardon to the city of\r\nMadrid, protection and security for the peaceful inhabitants, respect\r\nfor the churches and the clergy, oblivion for the past,’ was delivered\r\nto the Junta, the majority decided to treat with him. They sent out as\r\nnegotiators General Morla, representing the military element, and Don\r\nBernardo Iriarte[523], on behalf of the civil authorities. Napoleon\r\ntreated these delegates to one of those scenes of simulated rage which\r\nhe was such an adept at producing--his harangue was quite in the style\r\nof the famous allocutions to Lord Whitworth and to Metternich. It was\r\nnecessary, he thought, to terrify the delegates. Accordingly he let\r\nloose on Morla a storm of largely irrelevant abuse, stringing together\r\naccusations concerning the bombardment of the French fleet at Cadiz,\r\nthe violation of the Convention of Baylen, the escape of La Romana’s\r\ntroops from the Baltic, and (strangest of all!) the misconduct of the\r\nSpanish troops in Roussillon during the war of 1793-5. He ended by\r\ndeclaring that unless the city had been surrendered by six o’clock on\r\nthe following morning, every man taken in arms should be put to the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\n  [523] Not ‘another military officer,’ as Napier says.\r\n\r\nMorla was a very timid man[524], moreover he was already meditating\r\nsubmission to King Joseph: he returned to the Junta in a state of\r\nabsolute collapse, and gave such a highly coloured account of the\r\nEmperor’s wrath, and of the number of the French army, that there\r\nwas no further talk of resistance. The main difficulty was to stop\r\nthe promiscuous firing which was still going on at the outposts, and\r\nto induce the more exasperated section of the mob to quit the city\r\nor to lay down their arms. Many of them took the former alternative:\r\nthe Marquis of Castelar, resolved to avoid captivity, got together\r\nhis handful of regular troops, and fled in haste by the road towards\r\nEstremadura: he was followed by some thousands of peasants, and by\r\na considerable number of persons who thought themselves too much\r\ncompromised to be able to remain behind. Having got rid of the\r\nrecalcitrants, the Junta drew up a form of capitulation in eleven\r\narticles, and sent it out to the French camp. Napoleon, anxious above\r\nall things to get possession of the city as soon as possible, accepted\r\nit almost without discussion, though it contained many clauses entirely\r\ninappropriate to such a document. As he did not intend to observe\r\nany of the inconvenient stipulations, he did not care to waste time\r\nin discussing them[525]. Morla and Fernando de Vera, governor of the\r\ncity, came back with the capitulation duly ratified by Berthier, and\r\nnext morning the gates were opened, a division under General Belliard\r\nmarched in, and the Spaniards gave up their artillery and laid down\r\ntheir muskets without further trouble. After the spasmodic burst of\r\nenergy which they had displayed during the last four days, the citizens\r\nshowed a melancholy apathy which surprised the conquerors. There was\r\nno riot or confusion, nor were any isolated attempts at resistance\r\nmade. Hence the occupation of Madrid took place without any scenes of\r\nbloodshed or pillage, the Emperor for his part keeping a very stern\r\nhand upon the soldiery, and sending in as small a garrison as could\r\nsafely be allotted to the task.\r\n\r\n  [524] ‘Hombre de corazon pusilánime, aunque de fiera y africana\r\n  figura,’ says Toreño (i. 307).\r\n\r\n  [525] The first clause of the Capitulation was to the effect\r\n  that no religion save the Catholic Apostolic Roman faith should\r\n  be tolerated! The second provided that all government officials\r\n  should be continued in the tenure of their offices. Clearly such\r\n  articles were absurd in a military capitulation, and the second\r\n  was impossible to execute, as the conqueror must necessarily\r\n  place in office such persons as he could trust. But the amnesty\r\n  articles (Nos. 4 and 11) could have been observed, and were not.\r\n\r\nMadrid having fallen after no more than two days of resistance, the\r\ntwo Spanish field-armies which were marching to its aid were far too\r\nlate to be of any use. The army of the Centre under La Peña had reached\r\nGuadalajara at nightfall on December 2: there it was met by the Duke\r\nof Infantado, who had come out from Madrid to hurry on the troops. At\r\nhis solicitation the wearied and disorganized host, with Ney’s corps\r\npressing hard on its heels, marched for San Torcaz and Arganda, thus\r\nplacing itself in a most dangerous position between the Emperor and the\r\ncorps that was in pursuit. Fortunately La Peña got early news of the\r\ncapitulation, and swerving southward from Arganda, made for the passage\r\nof the Tagus at Aranjuez. But Bonaparte had sent out part of Victor’s\r\ncorps to seize that place, and when the army of the Centre drew near,\r\nit found French troops in possession [December 6]. With Ney behind,\r\nVictor in front, and Bessières’ cavalry ranging all over the plain of\r\nNew Castile, the Spaniards were in grave danger. But they escaped by\r\nway of Estremera, crossed the ferries on the Upper Tagus, and finally\r\nrallied--in a most miserable and disorganized condition--at Cuenca.\r\nThe artillery, unable to leave the high-road, had been sent off three\r\ndays before, from Guadalajara towards the kingdom of Murcia, almost\r\nwithout an escort: by a piece of extraordinary luck it escaped without\r\nseeing an enemy.\r\n\r\nThe doings of the disorganized divisions of San Juan and Heredia, which\r\nhad marched from Segovia on December 2, were much more discreditable.\r\nLate on the third they reached the Escurial, some thirty miles from\r\nMadrid, and were met by fugitives from the capital, who reported that\r\nthe Retiro had been stormed, and that the Junta of Defence was debating\r\nabout a surrender. The two commanders were doubting whether they ought\r\nnot to turn back, when their troops broke out into mutiny, insisting\r\nthat the march on Madrid must be continued. After a scene of great\r\ndisorder the generals gave in, and resumed their advance on the morning\r\nof the fourth, just at the moment when Morla was opening the gates\r\nto Napoleon. They had only gone a few miles when certain news of the\r\ncapitulation was received. There followed a disgraceful scene; the cry\r\nof treason ran down the ranks: some battalions disbanded themselves,\r\nothers attacked their own officers, and the whole mass dissolved and\r\nwent off in panic to Talavera, leaving its artillery abandoned by the\r\nwayside. They had not even seen a French vedette, or fired a single\r\nshot, yet they fled in utter rout for sixty miles, and only halted\r\nwhen they could run no further. Seven or eight thousand men out of the\r\ntwo armies were got together at Talavera, on the sixth; but when, next\r\nmorning, San Juan attempted to take up the command again, they raised\r\nthe idiotic cry that he wished to lead them forward into the midst of\r\nNapoleon’s armies in order to force them to surrender! The unfortunate\r\ngeneral was hunted down, shot as he was trying to escape from a window,\r\nand hung from a large elm-tree just outside the town. This was the most\r\ndisgraceful scene of the whole campaign in 1808. It was not for some\r\ndays later that the remnants of this miserable army were reduced to\r\nsome shadow of discipline, and consented to march under the command of\r\nnew generals.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that even if Madrid had held out for a day or two more, by\r\ndint of desperate street-fighting, it would have got no effective aid\r\nfrom the armies in the field. We cannot therefore say that the Junta of\r\nDefence did much harm by its tame surrender. From the military point\r\nof view Madrid was indefensible: on the other hand it was eminently\r\ndesirable, from the political point of view, that Napoleon should not\r\nenter the place unopposed, to be received, as at Vienna or Berlin, by\r\nobsequious deputations mouthing compliments, and bearing the keys of\r\nthe city on silver salvers. It was far better, in the long run, for\r\nSpain and for Europe that he should be received with cannon-balls, and\r\nforced to fight his way in. This simple fact made all his fictions\r\nto the effect that he was only opposed by the rabble, the monks,\r\nand the agents of England appear absurd. He could not, after this,\r\npretend to introduce his brother Joseph as a legitimate sovereign\r\nquietly returning to his loyal capital. So much was secured by the two\r\ndays’ resistance of Madrid: on the other hand, when once the French\r\nwere inside the city, and further resistance would have ended merely\r\nin general pillage and conflagration, it would have required more\r\nthan Spartan resolution for the Junta to go on fighting. If Madrid\r\nhad been burnt like Moscow, the moral effect on Spain and on Europe\r\nwould, no doubt, have been enormous. But the heterogeneous council\r\nof war, composed of dispirited officers and local notables trembling\r\nfor their homes, could hardly be expected to see this. They yielded,\r\nconsidering that they had already done enough by way of protest--and\r\neven with Saragossa in our mind we should be loth to say that their\r\ncapitulation was culpable. The one shameful thing about the surrender\r\nwas that within a few days both Morla, the military head of the\r\ndefence, and several of the chief civil officials, swore allegiance to\r\nJoseph Bonaparte, and took service under him. Such treason on the part\r\nof prominent men did more to encourage the invader and to dishearten\r\nSpain and her allies than the loss of half a dozen battles. For, when\r\nonce desertion begins, no one knows where it will stop, and every man\r\ndistrusts his neighbour as a possible traitor. Madrid, as we have\r\nalready said, was not a true national capital, nor was its loss a\r\nfatal blow; but that its chief defenders should shamelessly throw over\r\nthe cause of their country, and join the enemy, was a symptom of the\r\nmost dire and deadly sort. But, fortunately, the fate of the country\r\nwas not in the hands of its corrupt bureaucracy, but in those of its\r\nmuch-enduring people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII\r\n\r\nTHE CAMPAIGN OF SIR JOHN MOORE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON AT MADRID\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom December 4 to December 22 the Emperor remained fixed in the\r\nneighbourhood of Madrid. He did not settle down in the royal palace,\r\nand it would seem that he made no more than one or two hurried visits\r\nof inspection to the city[526]. He established himself outside the\r\ngates, at Chamartin, a desolate and uncomfortable country house of the\r\nDuke of Infantado, and devoted himself to incessant desk-work[527].\r\nIt was here that he drew up his projects for the reorganization of\r\nthe kingdom of Spain, and at the same time set himself to the task of\r\nconstructing his plans of campaign against those parts of the Peninsula\r\nwhich still remained unsubdued. In seventeen days, uninterrupted by\r\nthe cares of travel, Bonaparte could get through an enormous amount of\r\nbusiness. His words and deeds at this period are well worth studying,\r\nfor the light that they throw alike on his own character and on his\r\nconceptions of the state and the needs of Spain.\r\n\r\n  [526] Not, as the Spaniards whispered, because he feared the\r\n  stiletto of some fanatical monk, but because he wished to leave\r\n  the place clear for his brother Joseph. For the curious story of\r\n  his visit to the royal palace, and long study of the portrait of\r\n  Philip II, see Toreño, i. 309.\r\n\r\n  [527] For the discomforts of Chamartin see the _Mémoires sur la\r\n  Révolution d’Espagne_ of De Pradt. Though belonging to one of\r\n  the richest nobles of Spain, it had not a single fireplace, and\r\n  the imperial courtiers and aides-de-camp had to shiver in the\r\n  ante-rooms over miserable _braseros_.\r\n\r\nHis first act was to annul the capitulation which he had granted to the\r\ninhabitants of Madrid. Having served its purpose in inducing the Junta\r\nto yield, it was promptly violated. ‘The Spaniards have failed to carry\r\nit out,’ he wrote, ‘and I consider the whole thing void[528].’ Looking\r\nat the preposterous clauses which he had allowed to be inserted in the\r\ndocument, there can be no doubt that this was his intention at the very\r\nmoment when he ratified it. It was a small thing that he should break\r\nengagements, such as those in which he had promised not to quarter\r\ntroops in the monasteries (Article 7), or to maintain all existing\r\nofficials in their places (Article 2). But having guaranteed security\r\nfor their life and property, freedom from arrest, and free exit at\r\ntheir pleasure, to such persons as chose to remain behind in the city,\r\nit was shameless to commence his proceedings with a proscription and\r\na long series of arrests. The list of persons declared traitors and\r\ncondemned to loss of life and goods was not very long: only ten persons\r\nwere named, and seven of these were absent from Madrid. But the three\r\nothers, the Prince of Castelfranco, the Marquis of Santa Cruz, and the\r\nCount of Altamira, were seized and dispatched into France, sentenced to\r\nimprisonment for life.\r\n\r\n  [528] ‘La capitulation, n’ayant pas été tenue par les habitants\r\n  de Madrid, est nulle,’ Napoleon to Belliard, Dec. 5 (_Nap.\r\n  Corresp._, 14,534). He scolds Belliard for having allowed the\r\n  document to be printed and placarded on the walls. Every copy was\r\n  to be torn down at once. In what respect the Spaniards had broken\r\n  the treaty he does not state. He may have referred to the evasion\r\n  of Castelar’s troops.\r\n\r\nThe arrests were a much more serious matter. In flagrant contravention\r\nof the terms of surrender, Bonaparte put under lock and key all the\r\nmembers of the Council of the Inquisition on whom he could lay hands,\r\nirrespective of what their conduct had been during the reign of the\r\nSupreme Junta. He also declared all the superior officers of the army\r\nresident in Madrid, even retired veterans, to be prisoners of war,\r\nand liable to answer with their necks for the safety of the captives\r\nof Dupont’s corps. Among them was discovered an old French _émigré_,\r\nthe Marquis de Saint-Simon, who had entered the service of Charles\r\nIV as far back as 1793, and had taken part in the last campaign. The\r\nEmperor refused to consider him as a Spaniard, declared that he was\r\none of his own subjects, had him tried by court-martial, and condemned\r\nhim to death. All this was to lead up to one of those odious comedies\r\nof magnanimity which Bonaparte sometimes practised for the benefit of\r\nthe editor of the _Moniteur_. Saint-Simon’s daughter was admitted to\r\nthe imperial presence to beg for her father’s life, and the master\r\nof the world deigned to commute the punishment of the ‘traitor’ to\r\nimprisonment for life in the mountain-fortress of Joux[529]. This was\r\na repetition of the Hatzfeldt affairs at Berlin, and Saint-Simon was\r\ntreated even worse than the unfortunate Prussian nobleman of 1806.\r\nTruly the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel!\r\n\r\n  [529] Cf. _Nap. Corresp._, 14,708, with De Pradt (p. 205-6) and\r\n  Arteche (iii. 432).\r\n\r\nAmong other persons who were arrested were Don Arias Mon, president of\r\nthe Council of Castile, the Duke of Sotomayor, and about thirty other\r\nnotables: some were ultimately sent away to France, others allowed to\r\ngo free after swearing allegiance to Joseph Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nAll these measures were designed to strike terror into the hearts of\r\nthe Spaniards. But at the same time the Emperor issued a series of\r\ndecrees--in his own name and not in that of his brother, the titular\r\nking--which were intended to conciliate them by bestowing upon them\r\ncertain tangible benefits. He knew that there existed the nucleus of\r\na Liberal party in Spain, and hoped to draw it over to his side by\r\nintroducing certain much-needed reforms in the administration of the\r\ncountry. With this object he removed the tiresome inter-provincial\r\noctroi duties, abolished all feudal dues and all rights of private\r\njurisdiction, declared that all monopolies should be annulled, and\r\nforbade all assignments of public revenues to individuals. Such\r\nmeasures would have seemed excellent to many good Spaniards, if they\r\nhad been introduced by a legitimate ruler: but coming from the hand\r\nof a foreign conqueror they were without effect. Moreover there\r\nwas hardly a square mile of Spanish territory, outside Madrid and\r\nthe other towns held by the French, where Napoleon’s writs could\r\nrun. Every village which was unoccupied was passively or actively\r\ndisobedient. The reforms, therefore, were but on paper. Another series\r\nof decrees, which appeared at the same time, were in themselves quite\r\nas justifiable as those which were concerned with administrative\r\nchanges, but were certain to offend nine-tenths of the Spanish nation.\r\nThey dealt with the Church and its ministers. The most important was\r\none which declared (with perfect truth) that there were far too many\r\nmonasteries and nunneries in Spain, and that it was necessary to cut\r\nthem down to one-third of their existing number. The names of those\r\nwhich were destined to survive were published: to them the inmates of\r\nthe remaining institutions were to be transferred, as vacancies arose.\r\nThe suppressed convents were to become the property of the state. Part\r\nof their revenues was to be devoted to raising the salaries of the\r\nsecular clergy, so that every parish priest should have an income of\r\n2,400 reals (about £25). Monks or nuns who might choose to leave the\r\nmonastic life were to be granted a small pension[530]. At the same\r\ntime the Inquisition was abolished ‘as dangerous to the crown and to\r\ncivil authority,’ and all its property confiscated. In Madrid there was\r\nseized 2,453,972 reals in hard cash--about £25,000; the smallness of\r\nthe amount much surprised the French, who had vague ideas concerning\r\nthe fabulous wealth of the institution[531].\r\n\r\n  [530] For details see the decree in _Nap. Corresp._, 14,528. The\r\n  last-named clause curiously resembles a provision of Henry VIII\r\n  of England, at the Dissolution of 1536.\r\n\r\n  [531] Cf. _Nap. Corresp._, 14,563, and De Pradt, _Mémoires_, &c.,\r\n  p. 205.\r\n\r\nThe only results of these measures were that every Spaniard was\r\nconfirmed in his belief that Napoleon was a concealed atheist and an\r\nirreconcilable enemy of all religion. Could anything else be expected\r\nof one who (in spite of his _Concordats_ and _Te Deums_) was after\r\nall a child of the Revolution? The man who had persecuted the Pope\r\nin January, 1808, would naturally persecute the monks of Spain in\r\nDecember. As to the Inquisition, its fate inspired no rejoicing: it\r\nhad been effete for many years: there was not a prisoner in any of\r\nits dungeons. Indeed it had enjoyed a feeble popularity of late, for\r\nhaving refused to lend itself as a tool to Godoy. The only result of\r\nNapoleon’s decree for its abolition was that it acquired (grotesque\r\nas the idea may seem) considerable credit in the eyes of the majority\r\nof the Spanish people, as one of the usurper’s victims. Never was\r\nwork more wasted than that which the Emperor spent on his reforms of\r\nDecember, 1808. They actually tended to make old abuses popular with\r\nthe masses, merely because he had attempted to remove them. As to the\r\npossibility of conciliating the comparatively small body of Liberals,\r\nhe was equally in error: they agreed with the views of Jovellanos:\r\nreforms were necessary, but they must come from within, and not be\r\nimposed by force from without. They were Spaniards first and reformers\r\nafterwards. The only recruits whom Bonaparte succeeded in enrolling\r\nfor his brother’s court were the purely selfish bureaucrats who would\r\naccept any government--who would serve Godoy, Ferdinand, Joseph, a red\r\nrepublic, or the Sultan of Turkey with equal equanimity, so long as\r\nthey could keep their places or gain better ones.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor had a curious belief in the power of oaths and phrases over\r\nother men, though he was entirely free himself from any feebleness of\r\nthe kind. He took considerable pains to get up a semblance of national\r\nacceptance of his brother’s authority, now that his second reign was\r\nabout to begin. Joseph had appeared at Chamartin on December 2[532]:\r\nbut he was not allowed to re-enter Madrid for many days. The Emperor\r\ntold him to stay outside, at the royal palace of the Pardo, till things\r\nwere ready for his reception. This was not at all to the mind of the\r\nKing, who took his position seriously, and was deeply wounded at being\r\nordered about in such an arbitrary fashion. He sent in a formal protest\r\nagainst the publication of the decrees of December 4: his own name,\r\nhe complained, not that of his brother, ought to have appeared at\r\nthe bottom of all these projects of reform. He had never coveted any\r\ncrown, and least of all that of Spain: but having once accepted the\r\nposition he could not consent to be relegated into a corner, while all\r\nthe acts of sovereignty were being exercised by his brother. He was\r\nready to resign his crown into the hands from which he had received\r\nit: but if he was not allowed to abdicate, he must be allowed to reign\r\nin the true sense of the word. It made him blush with shame before his\r\nsubjects[533] when he saw them invited to obey laws which he had never\r\nseen, much less sanctioned. Napoleon refused to accept this abdication:\r\nhe looked at matters from an entirely different point of view. He was\r\nmaster of Spain, as he considered, not merely by the cession made at\r\nBayonne, but by the new title of conquest. He intended to restore\r\nJoseph to the throne, but till he had done so he saw no reason why he\r\nshould not exercise all the rights of sovereignty at Madrid. If, in\r\na moment of pique, he said that his brother might exchange the crown\r\nof Spain for that of Italy, or for the position of lieutenant of the\r\nEmperor in France during his own numerous absences, there is clear\r\nevidence that these were empty words. His dispatches show not the least\r\nsign of any project for the future of Spain other than the restoration\r\nof Joseph; and while the latter was at the Pardo he was continually\r\nreceiving notes concerning the reorganization of the Spanish army and\r\nfinances, which presuppose his confirmation on the throne within the\r\nnext few days[534].\r\n\r\n  [532] Napier (i. 273) makes a curious blunder in saying that he\r\n  remained at Burgos.\r\n\r\n  [533] This odd phrase is used by Joseph himself in his letter of\r\n  Dec. 8, sent from the Pardo, after he had received the decrees\r\n  issued on Dec. 4 by his brother.\r\n\r\n  [534] There is a complete _catena_ of letters and dispatches\r\n  from Dec. 4 to Dec. 22, in which the retention of Joseph as\r\n  king is presupposed: (1) 14,531 [Dec. 5] advises him to raise a\r\n  Spanish army; (2) 14,537 [Dec. 7] advises the Spaniards to ‘make\r\n  their King certain of their love and confidence’; (3) 14,543\r\n  [Dec. 9], the allocution to the Corregidor, bids the Madrileños\r\n  swear fidelity on the Sacrament to their King; (4) 14,558 [Dec.\r\n  13] speaks of the knitting up again of the bonds which attach\r\n  Joseph’s subjects to their sovereign; (5) 14,593 [Dec. 18] gives\r\n  the King advice as to the reorganization of his finances. None of\r\n  them could have been written if there had been any real intention\r\n  of ousting Joseph from the throne.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that Napoleon’s real object in keeping his brother off\r\nthe scene, and acting as if he intended to annex Spain to France as\r\na vassal province, was merely to frighten the inhabitants of Madrid\r\ninto a proper frame of mind. If they remained recalcitrant, and\r\nrefused to come before him with petitions for pardon, they were to be\r\nthreatened with a purely French military government. If they bowed the\r\nknee, they should have back King Joseph and the mockery of liberal\r\nand constitutional monarchy which he represented. So much we gather\r\nfrom the Emperor’s celebrated proclamation of December 7, and his\r\nallocution to the Corregidor and magistrates of Madrid two days later.\r\nBoth of these addresses are in the true Napoleonesque vein. In the\r\nfirst we read that if the people of Spain prefer ‘the poisons which the\r\nEnglish have ministered to them’ to the wholesome régime introduced\r\nfrom France, they shall be treated as a conquered province, and Joseph\r\nshall be removed to another throne. ‘I will place the crown of Spain on\r\nmy own brow, and I will make it respected by evil-doers, for God has\r\ngiven me the strength and the force of will necessary to surmount all\r\nobstacles.’ In the second, which is written in a mood of less rigour,\r\nthe inhabitants of Madrid are told that nothing could be easier than to\r\ncut up Spain into provinces, each governed by a separate viceroy. But\r\nif the clergy, nobles, merchants, and magistrates of the capital will\r\nswear a solemn oath upon the Blessed Sacrament to be true and loyal for\r\nthe future to King Joseph, he shall be restored to them and the Emperor\r\nwill make over to him all his rights of conquest. We cannot stop to\r\nlinger over the other details of these addresses: one of the most\r\nastounding statements in them is that the quarrel between King Charles\r\nand King Ferdinand had been hatched by the English ministry[535], and\r\nthat the Duke of Infantado, acting as their tool, was plotting to make\r\nSpain England’s vassal, ‘an insensate project which would have made\r\nblood run in torrents’! But this mattered little, as within a few weeks\r\nevery English soldier would have been cast out of the Peninsula, and\r\nLisbon no less than Saragossa, Valencia, and Seville would be flying\r\nthe French flag[536].\r\n\r\n  [535] _Nap. Corresp._, 14,547, p. 108.\r\n\r\n  [536] Napier (i. 273) prints Bonaparte’s allocution in full,\r\n  with the astonishing comment that it ‘was an exposition of the\r\n  principles upon which Spain was to be governed, and it forces\r\n  reflection upon the passionate violence with which men resist\r\n  positive good, to seek danger, misery, and death rather than\r\n  resign their prejudices.’ Is the desire for national independence\r\n  a prejudice? And should it be easily resigned for ‘positive\r\n  good,’ e.g. administrative reform?\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Emperor’s command, the notables of Madrid,\r\ncivil and ecclesiastical, were compelled to go through the ceremony of\r\nswearing allegiance to King Joseph on the Holy Sacrament, which was\r\nexposed for several days in every church for this purpose. Apparently\r\na very large number of persons were induced, by terror or despair, to\r\ngive in their formal submission to the intrusive King. Three pages of\r\nthe _Madrid Gazette_ for December 15 are filled with the names of the\r\ndeputies of the ten quarters and sixty-four _barrios_ of the city, who\r\njoined in the formal petition for the restoration to them of ‘that\r\nsovereign who unites so much kindness of heart with such an interest in\r\nthe welfare of his subjects, and whose presence will be their joy.’\r\n\r\nSatisfied with this declaration, and pretending to take it as the\r\nexpression of the wishes of every Spaniard who was not the paid agent\r\nof England or the slave of the Inquisition, the Emperor was graciously\r\npleased to restore Joseph to all his rights. Great preparations were\r\nmade for his solemn entry, which was celebrated with considerable state\r\nin the month of January.\r\n\r\nBut his plans for the reorganization of Spain only formed a part\r\nof the Emperor’s work at Chamartin. He was also busied in the\r\nreconcentration of his armies, for the purpose of overrunning those\r\nparts of the Peninsula which still remained unconquered. On the very\r\nmorrow of the fall of Madrid he had pushed out detachments in all\r\ndirections, to cover all the approaches to the capital, and to hunt\r\ndown any remnants of the Spanish armies which might still be within\r\nreach[537]. He was particularly hopeful that he might catch the army\r\nof the Centre, which, with Ney and Maurice Mathieu at its heels, was\r\ncoming in from the direction of Siguenza and Calatayud. To intercept\r\nit the fusiliers of the Guard marched for Alcala, one of Victor’s\r\ndivisions for Guadalajara, and another for Aranjuez; while Bessières\r\nwith the Guard cavalry, and one of Latour-Maubourg’s brigades of\r\ndragoons, swept all the country around the Tajuna and the Tagus.\r\nBut, as we have already seen, La Peña’s famishing men ultimately got\r\naway in the direction of Cuenca. When it was certain that they had\r\nescaped from the net, Napoleon rearranged his forces on the eastern\r\nside of Madrid. Bessières, with Latour-Maubourg’s whole division of\r\ndragoons[538], occupied cantonments facing at once towards Cuenca and\r\ntowards La Mancha: the Marshal’s head quarters, on December 11, were\r\nat Tarancon. Of Victor’s infantry, one division (Ruffin) marched on\r\nToledo, which opened its gates without resistance; another, that of\r\nVillatte, remained at Aranjuez with an advanced guard at Ocaña, a few\r\nmiles further south. The third division of the 1st Corps, that of\r\nLapisse, remained at Madrid. Ney’s troops were also at hand in this\r\nquarter: when La Peña had finally escaped from him, he was told to\r\nleave the division of Dessolles at Guadalajara and Siguenza. These\r\nforces were destined to keep open the communications between Madrid and\r\nAragon, where the siege of Saragossa was just about to begin. With his\r\nother two divisions, those of Marchand and Maurice Mathieu[539], Ney\r\nwas directed to march into Madrid: he was to form part of the mass of\r\ntroops which the Emperor was collecting, in and about the capital, for\r\nnew offensive operations. For this same purpose the 4th Corps, that of\r\nLefebvre, was brought up from Old Castile: the Marshal with his two\r\nleading divisions, those of Sebastiani and Leval, arrived in Madrid on\r\nDecember 9: his third division, that of Valence, composed of Poles,\r\nwas some way to the rear, having only reached Burgos on December 1.\r\nBut by the thirteenth the whole corps was concentrated at Madrid. A\r\nfew days later the divisions of Sebastiani and Valence were pushed on\r\nto Talavera, as if to form the advanced guard of an expedition against\r\nEstremadura, while that of Leval remained in Madrid[540]. Talavera had\r\nbeen occupied, before the Duke of Dantzig’s arrival, by the cavalry\r\nof Lasalle and Milhaud, who drove out of it without difficulty the\r\ndemoralized troops that had murdered San Juan. This mob, now under the\r\norders of Galluzzo, the Captain-General of Estremadura, fled behind the\r\nTagus and barricaded the bridges of Arzobispo and Almaraz, to cover its\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n  [537] _Nap. Corresp._, 14,525.\r\n\r\n  [538] I cannot speak for certain as to the moment at which\r\n  Digeon’s brigade of dragoons, which had been lent to Lannes for\r\n  the Tudela campaign, rejoined Latour-Maubourg. But probably it\r\n  came across with Ney, as it was with its division by Dec. 28\r\n  (Jourdan’s _Mémoires_, p. 138).\r\n\r\n  [539] The latter had taken over Lagrange’s division after Tudela.\r\n\r\n  [540] This division was incomplete, having left behind in Biscay\r\n  two Dutch and one German battalions.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the troops of Victor, Lefebvre, and\r\nDessolles, with the cavalry of Latour-Maubourg, Lasalle, and Milhaud\r\nthrown out in front of them, formed a semicircle protecting Madrid to\r\nthe east, the south, and the south-west. On the north-west, in the\r\ndirection of the Guadarrama and the roads towards the kingdom of Leon,\r\nthe circle was completed by a brigade of Lahoussaye’s division of\r\ndragoons, who lay in and about Avila[541]. In the centre, available for\r\na blow in any direction, were the whole of the Imperial Guard (horse\r\nand foot), Ney’s corps, Lapisse’s division of Victor’s corps, and\r\nLeval’s division of Lefebvre’s corps, besides King Joseph’s Guards--a\r\ntotal of at least 40,000 men. It only needed the word to be given,\r\nand these troops (after deducting a garrison for Madrid) could march\r\nforward, either to join Lefebvre for a blow at Lisbon, or Victor for a\r\nblow at Seville.\r\n\r\n  [541] The other brigade was astray near Toledo, contrary to the\r\n  Emperor’s intention: _Nap. Corresp._, 14,594, orders it to march\r\n  on Talavera.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there were still reinforcements coming up from the rear:\r\nthe belated corps of Mortier, the last great instalment of the army\r\nof Germany, had at last reached Vittoria, accompanied by the division\r\nof dragoons of Lorges. The Marshal was directed to take his corps to\r\nSaragossa, in order to assist Lannes and Moncey in the siege of that\r\ncity; but the dragoons were sent to Burgos on the road to Madrid.\r\nMoreover Junot’s corps, after having been refitted and reorganized\r\nsince its return from Portugal, was also available. Its leading\r\ndivision, that of Delaborde, had crossed the Bidassoa on December 4,\r\nand had now reached Burgos. The other two divisions, those of Loison\r\nand Heudelet (who had replaced Travot at the head of the 3rd Division)\r\nwere not far behind. They could all be brought up to Madrid by the\r\nfirst day of January. The last division of reserve cavalry, Millet’s\r\nfour regiments of dragoons, was due a little later, and had not yet\r\ncrossed the frontier.\r\n\r\nThat the Emperor believed that there was no serious danger to be\r\napprehended from the side of Leon and Old Castile, is shown by the\r\nfact that he allotted to these regions only the single corps of Soult.\r\nNor had the Duke of Dalmatia even the whole of his troops in hand, for\r\nthe division of Bonnet was immobilized in Santander, and only those of\r\nMerle and Mermet were near his head quarters at Carrion. The cavalry\r\nthat properly belonged to his corps were detached, under Lasalle, in\r\nNew Castile. Instead of them he had been assigned the four regiments\r\nforming the division of Franceschi[542]. He was promised the aid of\r\nMillet’s dragoons when they should arrive, but this would not be for\r\nsome three weeks at the least. Nevertheless, with the 15,000 foot and\r\n1,800 or 2,000 light cavalry at his disposal, Soult was told that he\r\ncommanded everything from the Douro to the Bay of Biscay, and that he\r\nmight advance at once into Leon, as there was nothing in his way that\r\ncould withstand him[543]. As far as the Emperor knew, the only hostile\r\nforce in this direction was the miserable wreck of Blake’s army, which\r\nhad been rallied by La Romana on the Esla. In making this supposition\r\nhe was gravely mistaken, and if Soult had obeyed his orders without\r\ndelay, and advanced westward from Carrion, he would have found himself\r\nin serious trouble; for, as we shall presently see, the English from\r\nSalamanca were in full march against him at the moment when the Emperor\r\ndispatched these instructions. It was in the valley of the Douro,\r\nand not (as Bonaparte intended) in that of the Tagus that the next\r\ndevelopments of the winter campaign of 1808 were to take place.\r\n\r\n  [542] 8th Dragoons, 22nd Chasseurs, 1st Supplementary regiment of\r\n  Chasseurs, and Hanoverian Chasseurs.\r\n\r\n  [543] Cf. _Nap. Corresp._, 14,581 (of Dec. 10, 1808, but wrongly\r\n  dated Dec. 17 in the collection), the rough draft of the\r\n  dispatch to be sent to Soult, with the full document, which was\r\n  fortunately captured on its way to Carrion, and fell into the\r\n  hands of Sir John Moore. It is printed in the original French in\r\n  James Moore’s account of his brother’s campaign (London, 1809).\r\n  The documents tally accurately, but Berthier has expanded, as was\r\n  his wont, Napoleon’s short phrases.\r\n\r\nIt remains only to speak of the north-east. The Emperor was determined\r\nthat Saragossa should pay dearly for the renown that it had won during\r\nits first siege. He directed against it not only Moncey’s force, the\r\ntroops which had won Tudela, but the whole of Mortier’s 5th Corps. One\r\nof its divisions was to take post at Calatayud, relieving Musnier’s\r\neight battalions at that point, and to keep open (with the aid of\r\nDessolles) the road from Saragossa to Madrid: but the rest would be\r\navailable to aid in the siege. More than 40,000 men were to be turned\r\nagainst Palafox and the stubborn Aragonese. With Catalonia we need not\r\ndeal in this place: the operations in the principality had little or no\r\nconnexion with those in the rest of Spain. St. Cyr and Duhesme, with\r\nthe 7th Corps, had to work out their own salvation. They were not to\r\nexpect help from the Emperor, nor on the other hand were they expected\r\nto assist him for the present, though it was hoped that some day they\r\nmight invade Aragon from the side of Lerida.\r\n\r\nLooking at the disposition of the French troops on December 15-20, we\r\ncan see that the Emperor had it in his power to push the central mass\r\nat Madrid, supported by the oncoming reserves under Junot and Lorges,\r\neither to support Lefebvre on the road to Lisbon, or Victor on the road\r\nto Seville. As a matter of fact there can be no doubt that the former\r\nwas his intention. He was fully under the impression that the English\r\narmy was at this moment executing a hasty retreat upon Portugal, and\r\nhe had announced that his next move was to hurl them into the sea.\r\n‘Tout porte à penser que les Anglais sont en pleine marche rétrograde,’\r\nhe wrote to Soult on December 10. On December 12 he issued in his\r\n_Bulletin_ the statement that the ‘English are in full flight towards\r\nLisbon, and if they do not make good speed the French army may enter\r\nthat capital before them[544].’ If anything was wanted to confirm the\r\nEmperor in his idea that the English were not likely to be heard of in\r\nthe north, it was the capture by Lasalle’s cavalry of eight stragglers\r\nbelonging to the King’s German Legion near Talavera. ‘When we catch\r\nHanoverians the English cannot be far off,’ he observed[545], and made\r\nall his arrangements on the hypothesis that Moore would be met in the\r\nvalley of the Tagus, and not in that of the Douro. In so doing he was\r\nbreaking one of his own precepts, that censuring generals ‘qui se font\r\ndes tableaux’ concerning their enemy’s position and intentions, before\r\nthey have sufficient data upon which to form a sound conclusion. All\r\nthat he really knew about Moore and his army was that they had reached\r\nSalamanca in the middle of November, and had been joined towards the\r\nend of the month by Hope’s column that marched--as we shall presently\r\nrelate--via Badajoz and the Escurial. Of the existence of this last\r\ndivision we have clear proof that Bonaparte was aware, for he inserted\r\na silly taunt in the _Bulletin_ of December 5 to the effect that ‘the\r\nconduct of the British had been dishonourable. Six thousand of them\r\nwere at the Escurial on November 20: the Spaniards hoped that they\r\nwould aid in the defence of the capital of their allies. But they did\r\nnot know the English: as soon as the latter heard that the Emperor\r\nwas at the Somosierra they beat a retreat, joined the division at\r\nSalamanca, and retired towards the sea-coast.’ There is also no doubt\r\nthat the Emperor had received intelligence of a more or less definite\r\nsort concerning the landing of Baird’s division at Corunna. It is\r\nvaguely alluded to in the 10th _Bulletin_, and clearly spoken of in\r\nthe _Madrid Gazette_ of December 17[546]. But though aware of the\r\nexistence of all the three fractions of the British army, Bonaparte\r\ncould draw no other deduction from the facts at his disposal than\r\nthat the whole of them would promptly retreat to Portugal, when the\r\npassage of the Somosierra and the fall of Madrid became known to\r\ntheir commander-in-chief. Lisbon, he thought, must be their base of\r\noperations, and on it they must retire: he had forgotten that one of\r\nthe advantages of sea-power is that the combatant who possesses it can\r\ntransfer his base to any port that he may choose. So far from being\r\ntied to Lisbon was Moore, that he at one moment contemplated making\r\nCadiz his base, and finally moved it to Corunna.\r\n\r\n  [544] See the statement in the _Madrid Gazette_ for Dec. 12\r\n  (p. 1576). It is not in the _Correspondance de Napoléon_, and\r\n  contains invaluable details as to the placing of the French army\r\n  on that day.\r\n\r\n  [545] ‘Le général Lasalle a pris huit Hanovriens.... Puisqu’il a\r\n  pris des Hanovriens, cela sent la proximité des Anglais’ (_Nap.\r\n  Corresp._, 14,551, Dec. 12). These must have been stragglers from\r\n  Hope’s division, which had passed Talavera at least a fortnight\r\n  before. The Germans with it were the 3rd Light Dragoons, K.G.L.\r\n\r\n  [546] Napoleon seems to have got the knowledge of Baird’s arrival\r\n  from the London newspapers. An English brigantine, called the\r\n  _Ferret_, ran into Santander, under the impression that it was\r\n  still in Spanish hands. On board were many journals, with details\r\n  about the Cintra Court of Inquiry, and about the reinforcements\r\n  for Spain. Long extracts from them were reprinted in the _Madrid\r\n  Gazette_ for the second half of December. The danger of the press\r\n  already existed!\r\n\r\nWith pre-conceived ideas of this sort in his head, the Emperor was\r\npreparing to push on his main body in support of the advanced troops\r\nunder Lefebvre and Lasalle on the road to Estremadura and Portugal.\r\nVictor meanwhile was to guard against the unlikely chance of any move\r\nbeing made on Madrid by the shattered ‘Army of the Centre’ from Cuenca,\r\nor by new Andalusian levies. Already Lasalle’s horsemen were pushing on\r\nto Truxillo and Plasencia, almost to the gates of Badajoz and to the\r\nPortuguese frontier, when unexpected news arrived, and the whole plan\r\nof campaign was upset.\r\n\r\nInstead of retiring on Lisbon, Sir John Moore had pushed forward\r\ninto the plains of Old Castile, and was advancing by forced marches\r\nto attack the isolated corps of Marshal Soult. Bonaparte was keenly\r\nalive, now as always, to the danger of a defeat in the valley of the\r\nDouro. Moreover the sight of a British army in the field, and within\r\nstriking distance, acted on him as the red rag acts upon the bull.\r\nNo toil or trouble would be too great that ended in its destruction,\r\nand looking at his maps the Emperor thought that he saw the way to\r\nsurround and annihilate Moore’s host. Throwing up without a moment’s\r\ndelay the whole plan for the invasion of Portugal, he marched for the\r\npasses of the Guadarrama with every man that was disposable at Madrid.\r\nHis spirits were high, and the event seemed to him certain. He sent\r\nback to his brother Joseph the command to put in the Madrid newspapers\r\nand circulate everywhere the news that 36,000 English troops were\r\nsurrounded and doomed to destruction[547]. Meanwhile, with 50,000 men\r\nat his back, he was marching hard for Arevalo and Benavente.\r\n\r\n  [547] I know no better way of displaying the Napoleonesque method\r\n  than the printing opposite each other of his dispatches 14,620\r\n  and 14,626, both addressed to Joseph Bonaparte. For the benefit\r\n  of the newspapers the English army was to be overstated by 10,000\r\n  or 12,000 men!\r\n\r\n  14,620.                          14,626.\r\n\r\n  Faites mettre dans les journaux  Leur force _réelle_ est de 20,000\r\n  et répandre partout que 36,000   à 21,000 infanterie, et de 4,000\r\n  Anglais sont cernés. Je suis     à 5,000 de cavalerie avec une\r\n  sur leurs derrières tandis que   quarantaine de pièces de canon.\r\n  le maréchal Soult est devant\r\n  eux.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMOORE AT SALAMANCA\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that on October 6, 1808, the command of the\r\nBritish forces in Portugal had passed into the hands of Sir John Moore,\r\nto the entire satisfaction of Wellesley and the other officers who had\r\nserved under those slow and cautious generals Sir Hew Dalrymple and\r\nSir Harry Burrard. The moment that the news of Vimiero was received,\r\nand long before the details of the Convention of Cintra could come to\r\nhand, the Government had determined to send on the victorious British\r\narmy into Spain, and to assist it with heavy reinforcements from home.\r\nDalrymple was even informed that he might cross the frontier at once,\r\nif he chose, without waiting for any detailed instructions from the War\r\nOffice[548]. Wellesley, as we have seen, thought that his chief should\r\nhave done so without delay, and observed that if _he_ had charge of\r\naffairs the army would be at Madrid by October 1[549].\r\n\r\n  [548] Castlereagh to Dalrymple, Sept. 2, 1808: ‘As circumstances\r\n  may come to your knowledge which might render the immediate\r\n  employment of your disposable forces in the north of Spain of the\r\n  utmost importance to the common cause, without waiting for orders\r\n  from hence, I am to inform you that you should not consider\r\n  the present instructions as depriving you of the latitude of\r\n  discretion which you now possess, without waiting for express\r\n  orders from hence.’\r\n\r\n  [549] See p. 274.\r\n\r\nYet when Moore took over the command, he found that little or nothing\r\nhad been done to carry out this design. The delay was partly occasioned\r\nby the tardy evacuation of Portugal by Junot’s troops: the last of\r\nthem, as we have seen[550], did not leave the Tagus till the month\r\nof October had begun. But it was still more due to the leisurely and\r\nfeeble management of Dalrymple, who would not march without detailed\r\nand definite orders from home. He might well have begun to move his\r\nbrigades eastward long before the last small detachments of the French\r\nhad disappeared. But when on October 6 Dalrymple’s successor looked\r\naround him, he found that the whole army was still concentrated in the\r\nneighbourhood of Lisbon, save Hope’s two brigades, and these had been\r\nsent forward to the frontier not so much for the purpose of entering\r\nSpain, as for that of bringing moral force to bear on General Galluzzo,\r\nand compelling him to abandon his ridiculous siege of Elvas. Two things\r\nhad been especially neglected by Dalrymple--the exploration of the\r\nroads that lead from Portugal into Spain, and the pressing on of the\r\nformation of a proper divisional and regimental transport for the army.\r\nIt is strange to find that he had remembered the existence of both of\r\nthese needs: his dispatches speak of his intention to send officers\r\nboth towards Badajoz and into Beira, and he asserts that ‘the army is\r\nin high order and fit to move when required[551].’ Yet his successor\r\nhad to state that as a matter of fact no body of information about the\r\nroutes and resources of Portugal and Spain had been collected, and that\r\nthe scheme for moving and feeding the army had not been drawn up. ‘When\r\nI shall pass the frontier of Portugal,’ wrote Moore to Castlereagh,\r\n‘it is impossible for me at this instant to say: it depends on a\r\nknowledge of the country which I am still without, and on commissariat\r\narrangements yet unmade[552].’ We may grant that Dalrymple had been\r\nsomewhat handicapped by the fact that his army had been landed,\r\nin the old haphazard British fashion, without any proper military\r\ntrain. We may also concede that no one could have foreseen that the\r\nPortuguese and Spanish governments would be unable to supply any useful\r\ninformation concerning the main roads and the resources of their own\r\ncountries. But the whole month of September had been at the disposal of\r\nthe late commander-in-chief, and he, with his quartermaster-general,\r\nMurray, must take the blame of having failed to accomplish in it all\r\nthat might have been done. Within a fortnight after the Convention of\r\nCintra had been signed, British officers ought to have explored every\r\nroad to the frontier, and to have reported on their facilities. Yet\r\non October 6 Moore could not find any one who could tell him whether\r\nthe roads Lisbon-Sabugal-Almeida, and Lisbon-Abrantes-Castello Branco\r\nwere or were not practicable for artillery! And this was in spite of\r\nthe fact that a British detachment had actually marched from Lisbon\r\nto Almeida, in order to receive the surrender of the garrison of\r\nthat fortress. The fact would seem to be that Dalrymple had placed\r\nhis confidence in the native governments of the Peninsula. He vainly\r\nimagined that the Portuguese engineers could supply him with accurate\r\ndetails concerning the roads and resources of Beira and the Alemtejo.\r\nHe sent a very capable officer--Lord William Bentinck--to Madrid, and\r\nentered into communication with the Spanish government. From them\r\nhe hoped that he might get some account of the plan of campaign in\r\nwhich his army was to join, a list of the routes which it would be\r\nconvenient for him to use, and details as to the way in which he could\r\ncollect and carry provisions. As a matter of fact he could only obtain\r\na quantity of vague and generally useless suggestions, some of which\r\nargued an astonishing ignorance of military affairs in those who made\r\nthem. If there had been a Spanish commander-in-chief, Dalrymple might\r\nhave extracted from him his views about the campaign that must shortly\r\nbegin. But the Junta had steadfastly refused to unite the charge of\r\ntheir many armies in the hands of a single general: they told Lord\r\nWilliam that he might make inquiries from Castaños: but the Andalusian\r\ngeneral could only speak for himself. It was not he, but a council\r\nof war, that would settle the plan of operations: he could only give\r\nBentinck the conclusions that had been arrived at after the abortive\r\nmeeting of generals that had taken place on September 5. In answer to\r\na string of questions administered to him by Dalrymple’s emissary,\r\nas to the routes that the British army had better follow, and the\r\nmethods of supply that it had better adopt, he could only reply that\r\nhe was at present without good maps, and could not give the necessary\r\ninformation in detail. He could only refer Bentinck to the newly formed\r\nCommissariat Board (_Junta de Víveres_), which ought to be able to\r\ndesignate the best routes with reference to the feeding of the army and\r\nthe establishment of magazines[553]. Of course this board turned out\r\nto know even less than Castaños himself. Nothing whatever was done for\r\nthe British army, with the exception that a certain Colonel Lopez was\r\nsent to its head quarters to act as the representative of the _Junta\r\nde Víveres_. It does not seem that he was able to do anything for the\r\nexpeditionary force that they could not have done for themselves. In\r\nthis way the whole time that Dalrymple had at his disposal had been\r\nwasted in the long correspondence with Madrid, and not a soldier had\r\npassed the frontier when Moore took up the command.\r\n\r\n  [550] See p. 283, dealing with the garrison of Elvas.\r\n\r\n  [551] Dalrymple to Castlereagh, Sept. 27.\r\n\r\n  [552] Moore to Castlereagh from Lisbon, Oct. 9, 1808.\r\n\r\n  [553] The very interesting (and sometimes very sensible) replies\r\n  of Castaños to Bentinck will be found in the latter’s letter to\r\n  Dalrymple (Oct. 2).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it ought at least to have been possible to make preparations\r\nin Portugal, even if nothing could be done in Spain. But the question\r\nof transport and commissariat was a very difficult one. The British\r\narmy had struggled from Mondego Bay to Lisbon with the aid of the\r\nsmall ox-wagons of the country-side, requisitioned and dismissed from\r\nvillage to village. But clearly a long campaign in Spain could not\r\nbe managed on these lines. A permanent provision of draught and pack\r\nanimals was required, and natives must be hired to drive them. The few\r\nregular enlisted men of the Royal Wagon Train who had reached Portugal\r\nwere only enough to take care of the more important military stores.\r\nMoreover their wagons turned out to be much too heavy for the roads of\r\nthe Peninsula, and had to be gradually replaced by country carts[554].\r\nThe great mass of the regimental baggage and the food had always to be\r\ntransported on mules, or vehicles bought or hired from the peasantry.\r\nThe Portuguese did not care to contract to take their animals over the\r\nfrontier, and it was most difficult to collect transport of any kind,\r\neven with the aid of the local authorities. When once Moore’s dreadful\r\nretreat began, his drivers and muleteers deserted their wagons and\r\nbeasts, and fled home, resolved that if they must lose their property\r\nthey would not lose their lives also[555].\r\n\r\n  [554] Moore to Castlereagh from Salamanca, Dec. 10, 1808.\r\n\r\n  [555] A good account of the difficulties of transport in Moore’s\r\n  army will be found in Quartermaster Surtees’s _Twenty-five Years\r\n  in the Rifle Brigade_. Placed in charge of the baggage and beasts\r\n  of the 2/95th, he found it absolutely impossible to keep the\r\n  native drivers from absconding, even when they had to sacrifice\r\n  their beasts to do so (pages 81-82).\r\n\r\nIn later years Wellington gradually succeeded in collecting a large\r\nand invaluable army of Spanish and Portuguese employés, who--in their\r\nown fashion--were as good campaigners as his soldiery, and served him\r\nwith exemplary fidelity even when their pay was many months in arrear.\r\nBut in 1808 this body of trained camp-followers did not exist, and\r\nMoore had the greatest difficulty in scraping together the transport\r\nthat took him forward to Salamanca. As to commissariat arrangements,\r\nhe found that even though he divided his army into several small\r\ncolumns, and utilized as many separate routes as possible, it was not\r\neasy for the troops to live. The commissariat officers, sent on to\r\ncollect magazines at the various halting-places, were so inexperienced\r\nand so uniformly ignorant of the Portuguese tongue, that even where\r\nthey were energetic they had the greatest difficulty in catering for\r\nthe army. Wellesley, as we have already seen[@repeated 556 note],\r\nhad been complaining bitterly of their inefficiency during the short\r\nVimiero campaign. Moore, more gracious in his phrases, wrote that ‘we\r\nhave a Commissariat extremely zealous, but quite new and inexperienced\r\nin the important duties which it falls to their lot to perform.’ This\r\nwas but one of the many penalties which England had to pay for her long\r\nabstention from continental warfare on a large scale. It is easy to\r\nblame the ministry, the permanent officials in London, or the executive\r\nofficials on the spot[556]. But in reality mere want of knowledge of\r\nthe needs of a great land-war accounts for most of the mistakes that\r\nwere committed. To lavish angry criticism on individuals, as did the\r\nOpposition papers in England at the time, was almost as unjust as it\r\nwas useless. The art of war, in this as in its other branches, had to\r\nbe learnt; it was not possible to pick it up by intuition. Nothing can\r\nbe more interesting than to look through the long series of orders and\r\ndirections drawn up by the quartermaster-general’s department between\r\n1809 and 1813, in which the gradual evolution of order out of chaos by\r\ndint of practical experience can be traced. But in October, 1808, the\r\nprocess was yet in its infancy.\r\n\r\n  [556] See p. 231.\r\n\r\nIt was with the greatest difficulty, therefore, that Moore got his\r\narmy under weigh. He found it, as he wrote to Castlereagh, ‘without\r\nequipment of any kind, either for the carriage of the light baggage\r\nof regiments, artillery stores, commissariat stores, or any other\r\nappendage of an army, and without a magazine formed on any of the\r\nroutes by which we are to march[557].’ Within ten days, however, the\r\nwhole force was on the move. The heavy impedimenta were placed in store\r\nin Lisbon: it was a thousand pities that the troops did not leave\r\nbehind their women and children, whose presence with the regiments was\r\ndestined to cause so many harrowing scenes during the forced marches\r\nof the ensuing winter. They were offered a passage to England, but the\r\ngreater part refused it, and the colonels (from mistaken kindness)\r\ngenerally allowed them to march with their corps.\r\n\r\n  [557] Moore to Castlereagh, Oct. 9, 1808.\r\n\r\nThe direction in which the army was to move had been settled in a\r\ngeneral way by the dispatches sent from Castlereagh to Dalrymple in\r\nSeptember[558]. It was to be held together in a single mass and sent\r\nforward to the Ebro, there to be put in line with Blake and Castaños.\r\nAn attempt on the part of the Junta to distract part of it to Catalonia\r\nhad been firmly and very wisely rejected. The French were still on\r\nthe defensive when the plan was drawn out, and Burgos had been named\r\nas the point at which the British troops might aim. It was very close\r\nto the enemy, but in September neither English nor Spanish statesmen\r\nwere taking into consideration the probability of the advent of the\r\nEmperor, and his immediate assumption of the offensive. They were\r\nrather dreaming of an advance towards the Pyrenees by the allied\r\narmies. If the large reinforcements which were promised to Moore were\r\ndestined to land at Corunna, rather than at Gihon or Santander, it was\r\nmerely because these latter ports were known to be small and destitute\r\nof resources, not because they were considered to be dangerously\r\nnear to the French. La Romana’s division, it will be remembered, was\r\nactually put ashore at Santander: it is quite possible that Sir David\r\nBaird’s troops might have been sent to the same destination, but for\r\nthe fortunate fact that it was believed that it would be impossible\r\nto supply him with transport from the bare and rugged region of\r\nthe Montaña. Corunna was selected as the landing-place for all the\r\nregiments that were to join Moore, partly on account of its safe and\r\nspacious port, partly because it was believed that food and draught\r\nanimals could be collected with comparative ease from Galicia.\r\n\r\n  [558] Castlereagh to Dalrymple, Sept. 2, 1808.\r\n\r\nMore than 12,000 men, including three regiments of cavalry (the arm\r\nin which the force in Portugal was most deficient) and a brigade of\r\nthe Guards, had been drawn from the home garrisons. The charge of this\r\nfine division had been given to Sir David Baird[559], an officer with\r\na great Indian reputation, but comparatively unpractised in European\r\nwarfare. They were embarked at Harwich, Portsmouth, Ramsgate, and Cork\r\nat various dates during September and October, and on the thirteenth\r\nof the latter month the main body of the force reached Corunna. By\r\nsome stupid mismanagement at home the cavalry, the most important part\r\nof the expedition, were shipped off the last, and did not arrive till\r\nthree weeks[560] after the rest of the troops had reached Spain.\r\n\r\n  [559] It is fair to this distinguished officer to state that his\r\n  dispatches and letters show no trace whatever of the irascible\r\n  and impracticable temper that has been attributed to him. They\r\n  are most sensible, cautious, and prudent, and not at all what\r\n  might have been expected from the hero of the story of ‘the lad\r\n  that was chained to our Davie.’\r\n\r\n  [560] The 7th and 10th Hussars apparently on Nov. 7, the 15th\r\n  Hussars on Nov. 12. See Baird to Castlereagh, Nov. 8 and 13, 1808.\r\n\r\nBy October 18 Moore reported that the greater part of his troops\r\nwere already in motion, and as Baird’s infantry had reached Corunna\r\non the thirteenth, it might have been expected that the junction\r\nof their forces would have taken place in time to enable them to\r\nplay a part in the defensive campaign against Napoleon which ended\r\nin the fall of Madrid on December 4. If the troops had marched\r\npromptly, and by the best and shortest routes, they might have easily\r\nconcentrated at Salamanca by the middle of November: Napier suggests\r\nthe thirteenth[561] as a probable day, and considering the distances\r\nthe date seems a very reasonable one. At that moment Gamonal and\r\nEspinosa had only just been fought and lost: Tudela was yet ten days\r\nin the future: sixteen days were to elapse before the Somosierra was\r\nforced. It is clear that the British army, which at Salamanca would\r\nhave been only seven marches (150 miles) from Madrid, and four marches\r\n(eighty miles) from Valladolid, might have intervened in the struggle:\r\nwhether its intervention might not have ended in disaster, considering\r\nthe enormous forces of the French[562], is another matter. But the\r\nBritish Government intended that Moore and Baird should take part in\r\nthe campaign: the Junta had been told to expect their help: and for the\r\nconsolidation of the alliance between the two nations it was desirable\r\nthat the help should be given in the most prompt and effective fashion.\r\n\r\n  [561] Napier, i. 347.\r\n\r\n  [562] It is to be remembered that Baird’s cavalry would not have\r\n  been up till Nov. 20-25, owing to its tardy start from England.\r\n  Nothing could have been more unlucky.\r\n\r\nThere is no possibility of asserting that this was done. Moore and\r\nBaird did not join till December 20: no British soldier fired a single\r\nshot at a Frenchman before December 12[563]. The whole army was so\r\nmuch out of the campaign that Bonaparte never could learn what had\r\nbecome of it, and formed the most erroneous hypotheses concerning\r\nits position and intentions. We may frankly say that not one of his\r\nmovements, down to the fall of Madrid, was in the least influenced by\r\nthe fact that there was a British force in Spain.\r\n\r\n  [563] At the skirmish at Rueda on that date.\r\n\r\nThat this circumstance was most unfortunate from the political point\r\nof view it would be childish to deny. It gave discontented Spaniards\r\nthe opportunity of asserting that they had been deserted and betrayed\r\nby their allies[564]. It afforded Bonaparte the chance, which he did\r\nnot fail to take, of enlarging upon the invariable selfishness and\r\ntimidity of the British[565]. It furnished the critics of the ministry\r\nin London with a text for declamations against the imbecility of its\r\narrangements. It is true that after the fall of Madrid Moore was\r\nenabled, by the new situation of affairs, to make that demonstration\r\nagainst the French lines of communication in Castile which wrecked\r\nNapoleon’s original plan of campaign, and saved Lisbon and Seville. But\r\nthis tardy though effective intervention in the struggle was a mere\r\nafterthought. Moore’s original plan had been to make a tame retreat\r\non Lisbon, when he discovered that he was too late to save Madrid. It\r\nwas a mere chance that an intercepted dispatch and an unfounded rumour\r\ncaused him to throw up the idea of retiring into Portugal, and to\r\nstrike at the Emperor’s flank and rear by his famous march on Sahagun.\r\nWithout this piece of good fortune he would never have repaired the\r\nmischief caused by the lateness of his original arrival on the scene.\r\nHow that late arrival came to pass it is now our duty to investigate.\r\n\r\n  [564] See the letters from Spanish officers in the _Madrid\r\n  Gazette_ for Dec. 19, 1808.\r\n\r\n  [565] See the Dec. 5 _Bulletin_, and the inspired articles in the\r\n  _Madrid Gazette_ for Dec. 14.\r\n\r\nAs far as Moore’s own army was concerned, the loss of time may be\r\nascribed to a single cause--a mistake made in the choice of the roads\r\nby which the advance into Spain was conducted. It was the original\r\nintention of the British general to march on Almeida and Ciudad Rodrigo\r\nby three parallel routes, those by Coimbra and Celorico, by Abrantes,\r\nCastello Branco, and Guarda, and by Elvas, Alcantara, and Coria[566].\r\nHe was compelled to utilize the last-named road, which was rather\r\ncircuitous and notoriously bad, by the fact that Dalrymple had left\r\nHope’s two brigades at Elvas, and that any advance from that place\r\ninto the kingdom of Leon could only be directed across the bridge\r\nof Alcantara. If Moore had stuck to this original resolve, and used\r\nnone but these three roads, his army might have been concentrated at\r\nSalamanca on or about November 13. This could have been done with\r\nease if all the reserve artillery and heavy baggage had taken the\r\nCoimbra-Celorico road, the easiest of the three, and nothing but an\r\nirreducible minimum had been allowed to follow the columns which went\r\nby the other routes. It would have been necessary also to move the\r\ntroops in masses of not less than a brigade, and to keep them well\r\nclosed up.\r\n\r\n  [566] Moore to Castlereagh, Oct. 9: ‘The march from this will be\r\n  by the three roads Coimbra, Guarda, and Alcantara.’\r\n\r\nMoore had the best intentions: he cut down the baggage to what\r\nhe considered the smallest practicable bulk, and started off the\r\nleading regiments on the Coimbra route as easily as October 11, two\r\ndays after he had taken over the command[567]. ‘I am sufficiently\r\naware,’ he wrote, ‘of the importance of even the name of a British\r\narmy in Spain, and I am hurrying as much as possible[568].’ Then\r\nfollowed an irreparable mistake: it was all-important to find\r\nout which of the roads was most suitable for artillery and heavy\r\nbaggage. Moore consulted the available officers of the old Portuguese\r\narmy, and received from them the almost incredibly erroneous\r\ninformation that neither the Coimbra-Celorico-Almeida road nor the\r\nAbrantes-Guarda-Almeida road was practicable for artillery. It would\r\nseem that he also sought information from the officers whom Dalrymple\r\nhad sent out into the province of Beira, and that their answers tallied\r\nwith those of the Portuguese[569], for he wrote to Castlereagh that\r\n‘every information agreed that neither of them was fit for artillery or\r\ncould be recommended for cavalry.’ General Anstruther, then in command\r\nat Almeida, must take a considerable share in the blame that has to be\r\ndistributed to those who failed to give the Commander-in-chief accurate\r\ninformation, for he more than any one else had been given the chance\r\nof trying these roads. But whatever may be the proportion in which the\r\ncensure must be distributed, a certain amount must be reserved for\r\nMoore himself. He ought on first principles to have refused to believe\r\nthe strange news that was brought to him. It might have occurred to\r\nhim to ask how heavy guns of position had found their way to the\r\nramparts of Almeida, the second fortress of Portugal, if there was\r\nno practicable road leading to it. A few minutes spent in consulting\r\nany book dealing with Portuguese history would have shown that in the\r\ngreat wars of the Spanish Succession, and again in that of 1762[570],\r\nforces of all arms had moved freely up and down the Spanish frontier,\r\nin the direction of Celorico, Guarda, Sabugal, and Castello Branco.\r\nEven a glance at Dumouriez’s _Account of the Kingdom of Portugal_, the\r\none modern military book on the subject then available, would have\r\nenabled Moore to correct the ignorant reports of the natives. Strangest\r\nof all, there seems to have been no one to tell him that, only four\r\nmonths before, Loison, in his campaign against the insurgents of Beira,\r\nhad taken guns first from Lisbon to Almeida, then from Almeida to\r\nPezo-de-Ragoa and Vizeu, and finally from Almeida to Abrantes[571].\r\nIt is simply astounding that no one seems to have remembered this\r\nsimple fact. In short, it was not easily pardonable in any competent\r\ngeneral that he should accept as possible the statement that there\r\nwas no road for artillery connecting the capital of Portugal and the\r\nmain stronghold of its north-eastern frontier. Moore did so, and in a\r\nfortnight was bitterly regretting his credulity. ‘If anything adverse\r\nhappens,’ he wrote to his subordinate Hope, ‘I have not necessity to\r\nplead: the road we are now travelling [Abrantes-Villa Velha-Guarda]\r\nreached Guarda, and as far as I have already seen the road presents\r\nfew obstacles, and those easily surmounted. This knowledge was only\r\nacquired by our own officers: when the brigade was at Castello Branco,\r\nit was still not certain that it could proceed[572].’ What made the\r\ncase worse was that another of the three roads, the one by Coimbra\r\nand Celorico, was far easier than that by Guarda. Both Wellesley and\r\nMasséna took enormous trains of artillery and baggage over it in 1810,\r\nwithout any particular difficulty[573].\r\n\r\n  [567] Moore to Castlereagh, Oct. 9.\r\n\r\n  [568] Ibid., Oct. 11.\r\n\r\n  [569] Moore also consulted Colonel Lopez, the Spanish officer\r\n  who had been sent to his head quarters by the Junta, as being\r\n  specially skilled in roads and topography. But Lopez disclaimed\r\n  any knowledge, and could only say that Junot’s artillery had been\r\n  nearly ruined by the roads between Ciudad Rodrigo and Abrantes.\r\n\r\n  [570] e.g. in 1706 Lord Galway took over forty guns, twelve of\r\n  which were heavy siege-pieces, from Elvas by Alcantara and Coria\r\n  to Ciudad Rodrigo. In 1762 the Spaniards took no less than ninety\r\n  guns from Ciudad Rodrigo by Celorico and Sabugal to Castello\r\n  Branco, and thence back into Spain.\r\n\r\n  [571] Napier does not seem to know this, and distinctly states\r\n  (i. 102) that Loison had no guns.\r\n\r\n  [572] Moore to Hope, from Almeida, Nov. 8.\r\n\r\n  [573] In endeavouring to excuse Moore, Napier takes the strange\r\n  course of making out that the Guarda road, though usable, as\r\n  experience showed, was ‘in a military sense, non-practicable’\r\n  from its difficulties. This will not stand in face of Moore’s\r\n  words quoted above. Of the Coimbra-Celorico road he omits all\r\n  mention (i. 345).\r\n\r\nMisled by the erroneous reports as to the impracticability of the\r\nPortuguese roads, Moore took the unhappy step of sending six of the\r\nseven batteries of his corps, his only two cavalry regiments, and\r\nfour battalions of infantry to act as escort[574], by the circuitous\r\nhigh-road from Elvas to Madrid. In order to reach Salamanca they were\r\nto advance almost to the gates of the Spanish capital, only turning\r\noff at Talavera, in order to take the route by the Escurial, Espinar,\r\nand Arevalo. To show the result of this lamentable divagation, it is\r\nonly necessary to remark that from Lisbon to Salamanca via Coimbra\r\nis about 250 miles: from Lisbon to Salamanca via Elvas, Talavera,\r\nand Arevalo is about 380 miles: i.e. it was certain that the column\r\ncontaining all Moore’s cavalry and nearly all his guns would be at\r\nleast seven or eight days late at the rendezvous, in a crisis when\r\nevery moment was of vital importance. As a matter of fact the head of\r\nthe main column reached Salamanca on November 13: the cavalry and guns\r\nturned up on December 4. It would not be fair, however, to say that\r\nthe absence of Hope’s column delayed the advance of the whole army for\r\nso much as three weeks. It was only the leading regiments from Lisbon\r\nthat appeared on November 13. However carefully the march of the rest\r\nhad been arranged, the rear could not have come in till several days\r\nlater: indeed the last brigade did not appear till the twenty-third:\r\nthis delay, however, was owing to bad arrangements and preventable\r\naccidents. But it cannot be denied that the twelve days Nov. 23-Dec. 4\r\nwere completely sacrificed by the non-arrival of the cavalry and guns,\r\nwithout which Moore very wisely refused to move forward. If the army\r\nhad been concentrated--Baird could easily have arrived from Corunna\r\nere this--it would have been able to advance on November 23, and the\r\ncampaign would undoubtedly have been modified in its character, for\r\nthe Emperor would have learnt of the arrival of Moore upon the scene\r\nsome days before he crossed the Somosierra and started on his march for\r\nMadrid. There can be no doubt that he would have changed his plans on\r\nreceiving such news, for the sight of a British army within striking\r\ndistance would have caused him to turn aside at once with a large part\r\nof his army. Very probably he might have directed Lefebvre, Victor, and\r\nthe Imperial Guard--all the disposable forces under his hand--against\r\nMoore, and have left Madrid alone for the present as a mere secondary\r\nobject. It is impossible to deny that disaster to the British arms\r\nmight have followed: on the other hand Moore was a cautious general, as\r\nhis operations in December showed. He would probably have retired at\r\nonce to the mountains, and left the Emperor a fruitless stern-chase,\r\nsuch as that which actually took place a month later. But whether\r\nhe would have fallen back on the route to Portugal, or on the route\r\nto Galicia, it is impossible to say: everything would have depended\r\non the exact development of Napoleon’s advance, but the first-named\r\nalternative is the more probable[575].\r\n\r\n  [574] These were the 2nd, 36th, 71st, and 92nd Foot.\r\n\r\n  [575] Napier has a long note, in justification of Moore, to the\r\n  effect that if the concentration point of the British army had\r\n  been Burgos instead of Salamanca, Hope’s detour would have cost\r\n  no waste of time, and would have been rather profitable than\r\n  otherwise. But Moore distinctly looked upon the movement as a\r\n  deplorable necessity, not as a proper strategical proceeding.\r\n  ‘It is a great round,’ he wrote to Castlereagh on October 27,\r\n  when announcing this modification of his original plan, ‘and\r\n  will separate the corps, for a time, from the rest of the army:\r\n  _but there is no help for it_.’ Moreover he stated, in this same\r\n  letter, that he would not move forward an inch from Salamanca\r\n  till Hope should have reached Espinar, on the northern side of\r\n  the Guadarrama Pass. At a later date he announced that he should\r\n  not advance till Hope had got even nearer to him, and made his\r\n  way as far as Arevalo [letter of Nov. 24]. He was too good a\r\n  general to dream of a concentration at Burgos, when once he had\r\n  ascertained the relative positions of the Spanish and the French\r\n  armies, for that place was within a couple of marches of the\r\n  enemy’s outposts at Miranda and Logroño. There is, in short, no\r\n  way of justifying Hope’s circular march, when once it is granted\r\n  that the roads of Northern Portugal were not impracticable for\r\n  artillery. Moore knew this perfectly well, as his letter to Hope,\r\n  which we have quoted on p. 495 shows. No arguments are worth\r\n  anything in his justification when he himself writes ‘if anything\r\n  adverse happens, I have not necessity to plead.’ This is the\r\n  language of an honest man, conscious that he has made a mistake,\r\n  and prepared to take the responsibility. Napier’s apology for him\r\n  (i. 345-7) is but ingenious and eloquent casuistry.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous direction given to Moore’s cavalry and guns, however,\r\nwas not the only reason for the late appearance of the British army\r\nupon the theatre of war. Almost as much delay was caused by a piece\r\nof egregious folly and procrastination, for which the Spaniards\r\nwere wholly responsible. When Sir David Baird and the bulk of his\r\ngreat convoy arrived in the harbour of Corunna on October 13, he was\r\nastonished to find that the Junta of Galicia raised serious objections\r\nto allowing him to land. Their real reason for so doing was that\r\nthey wished the British troops to disembark further east, at Gihon\r\nor Santander. They did not realize the military danger of throwing\r\nthem ashore in places so close to the French army, nor did it affect\r\nthem in the least when they were told that the equipment of Baird’s\r\nforce in those barren regions would be almost impossible. All that\r\nthey cared for was to preserve Galicia from the strain of having to\r\nmake provisions for the feeding and transport of a second army, when\r\nall its resources had been sorely tried in supplying (and supplying\r\nmost indifferently) the troops of Blake. They did not, however, make\r\nmention of their real objections to Baird’s disembarkation in their\r\ncorrespondence with him, but assumed an attitude of very suspicious\r\nhumility, stating that they considered their functions to have come\r\nto an end now that the Central Junta had met, and that they thought\r\nit beyond their competence to give consent to the landing of such a\r\nlarge body of men without explicit directions from Aranjuez. Baird\r\ncould not offer to land by force, in face of this opposition. He did\r\nnot, however, move off to Santander (as the Galicians had hoped), but\r\ninsisted that an officer should be promptly dispatched to the Supreme\r\nJunta. This was done, but the delay in receiving an answer was so\r\ngreat that thirteen days were wasted: the Galician officer bearing\r\nthe consent of the central government travelled (so Moore complained)\r\nwith the greatest deliberation, as if he were carrying an unimportant\r\nmessage in full time of peace[576]. The first regiments, therefore,\r\nonly landed on October 26, and it was not till November 4 that all\r\nthe infantry were ashore. Thus they were certain to be late at the\r\nrendezvous in the plains of Leon. Nor was this all: the Supreme Junta\r\nhad suggested that, in order to facilitate the feeding of the division,\r\nBaird should send it forward not in large masses but in bodies of 2,000\r\nmen, with a considerable interval between them. The advice was taken,\r\nand in consequence the troops were soon spread out over the whole\r\nlength of road between Corunna and Astorga. The greatest difficulty was\r\nfound in equipping them for the march: Galicia, always a poor country,\r\nhad been almost stripped of mules and carts to supply Blake. It was\r\nabsolutely impossible to procure a sufficient train for the transport\r\nof Baird’s food and baggage. He was only able to gather enough beasts\r\nto carry his lighter impedimenta from stage to stage, by the offer of\r\nexorbitant rates of hire. He vainly hoped to complete his equipment\r\nwhen he should have reached the plains. Part of his difficulties was\r\ncaused by lack of money: the Government at home had not realized that\r\nonly hard cash would circulate in Spain: dollars in abundance were\r\nto come out in the _Tigre_ frigate in a few weeks: meanwhile it was\r\nexpected that the Spaniards would gladly accept British Government\r\nbills. But so little was paper liked in the Peninsula that only £5,000\r\nor £6,000 in dollars could be raised at Corunna[577]: without further\r\nresources it would have been impossible to begin to push the army\r\nforward. The feat was only accomplished by borrowing 92,000 dollars\r\nfrom the Galician Junta. For this act, carefully ignored by Napier,\r\nthey deserve a proper recognition: it shows a much better spirit than\r\nmight have been expected after their foolish behaviour about the\r\ndisembarkation. Shortly after, Baird succeeded in getting £40,000 from\r\nMr. Frere, the new minister to Madrid, who chanced to arrive at Corunna\r\nwith £410,000 in cash destined for the Spanish government. Finally on\r\nNovember 9 the expected ship came in with the 500,000 dollars that had\r\nbeen originally intended to be divided between Corunna and Lisbon,\r\nand Baird had as much money as he could possibly require, even when\r\nmules and draught-oxen had risen to famine prices in Galicia[578]. If\r\nhe still found it hard to move, it was because this poor and desolate\r\nprovince was really drained dry of resources[579].\r\n\r\n  [576] Moore to Bentinck from Salamanca, Nov. 13, 1808.\r\n\r\n  [577] Baird to Castlereagh, Oct. 14, 1808.\r\n\r\n  [578] Napier knew the correspondence of Baird by heart. It is\r\n  therefore most unfair in him to suppress the loan made by the\r\n  Galician Junta, which appears in Sir David’s letters of Oct. 22,\r\n  29, and Nov. 13, as also the receipt of the 500,000 dollars sent\r\n  by the British Government in the _Tigre_, which is acknowledged\r\n  in the letter of Nov. 9. He implies that the only sums received\r\n  were £40,000 from Mr. Frere and £8,000 from Sir John Moore. The\r\n  simple fact is that no good act done by a Spanish Junta or a Tory\r\n  minister is ever acknowledged by Napier.\r\n\r\n  [579] After reading Sir Charles Vaughan’s diary, showing how hard\r\n  he and Mr. Stuart found it to procure enough draught animals to\r\n  take their small party from Corunna to Madrid, in September,\r\n  1808, I cannot doubt that by October the collecting of the\r\n  transport for a whole army was an almost impossible task in\r\n  Galicia.\r\n\r\nBut what between the Junta’s folly in hindering the landing of the\r\ntroops, and the unfortunate lack of money in the second half of\r\nOctober, all-important time was lost. Baird ought to have been near\r\nSalamanca by November 13: as a matter of fact he had only reached\r\nAstorga with three brigades of infantry and some artillery, but without\r\na single mounted man to cover his march, on November 22. There he\r\nreceived, to his infinite dismay, the news that Blake had been routed\r\nat Espinosa on November 11, and Belvedere at Gamonal on November 10.\r\nThere was now no Spanish army between him and the French: the latter\r\nmight be advancing, for all he knew, upon Leon. He heard of Soult being\r\nat Reynosa, and Lefebvre at Carrion: if they continued their advance\r\nwestward, they would catch him, with the 9,000 infantry of the Corunna\r\ncolumn, marching across their front on the way to Salamanca. Appalled\r\nat the prospect, he halted at Astorga, and, after sending news of his\r\nsituation to Moore, began to prepare to retreat on Corunna, if the\r\nmarshals should continue their movement in his direction. This, as\r\nwe have already seen, they did not: Napoleon had no knowledge of the\r\nposition of the British troops, and instead of ordering the dukes of\r\nDalmatia and Dantzig to push westward, moved them both in a southerly\r\ndirection. Soult came down to Sahagun and Carrion: Lefebvre, on being\r\nrelieved by the 2nd Corps, moved on Madrid by way of Segovia. Thus\r\nBaird, left entirely unmolested, was in the end able to join Moore.\r\n\r\nIt is time to turn to the movements of that general. After sending\r\noff Sir John Hope on his unhappy circular march by Badajoz and the\r\nEscurial, he set out from Lisbon on October 26. He took with him the\r\nwhole force in Portugal, save a single division which was left behind\r\nto protect Lisbon, Elvas, and Almeida while a new native army was\r\nbeing reorganized. This detachment was to be commanded by Sir John\r\nCradock, who was just due from England: it comprised four battalions\r\nof the German Legion, a battalion each of the 9th, 27th, 29th, 31st,\r\n40th, 45th, and 97th Foot, the wrecks of the 20th Light Dragoons,\r\nand six batteries of artillery--about 9,000 men in all. The rest,\r\ntwenty-five battalions of infantry, two cavalry regiments and seven\r\nbatteries, marched for Spain. Two brigades under Beresford took the\r\ngood road by Coimbra and Celorico to Almeida: three under Fraser went\r\nby Abrantes and Guarda, taking with them the single battery which Moore\r\nhad retained with his main body, in order to try whether the roads of\r\nEastern Portugal were as bad as his advisers had reported. Two brigades\r\nunder General Paget, starting from Elvas, not from Lisbon, separated\r\nthemselves from Hope and marched on Ciudad Rodrigo by Alcantara and\r\nCoria. The general himself followed in the track of Fraser, whom he\r\novertook and passed in the neighbourhood of Castello Branco[580].\r\n\r\n  [580] It may perhaps be worth while to give the composition and\r\n  brigading of Moore’s army on the march from Lisbon and Elvas to\r\n  Salamanca.\r\n\r\n  There marched by Coimbra and Almeida, Beresford [1/9th, 2/43rd,\r\n  2/52nd] #/ and Fane [1/38th, 1/79th, 2/95th]. By Abrantes and\r\n  Guarda went Bentinck [1/4th, 1/28th, 1/42nd, and four companies\r\n  5/60th] and Hill [1/5th, 1/32nd, 1/91st]: this column took with\r\n  it one battery: it was followed by two isolated regiments,\r\n  the 1/6th and 1/50th. The corps which marched from Elvas by\r\n  Alcantara, under Paget, was composed of the brigades of Alten\r\n  (1st and 2nd Light Battalions of the K. G. L.) and Anstruther\r\n  20th, 1/52nd, 1/95th. The 3rd Regiment joined the army from\r\n  Almeida, where it was in garrison, and the 1/82nd came up\r\n  late from Lisbon. It was originally intended that Bentinck\r\n  and Beresford should form a division under Fraser, Anstruther\r\n  and Alten a division under Paget. Of the troops which reached\r\n  Salamanca the 3rd and 5/60th were sent back to Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe original brigading of Baird’s force was:--Cavalry Brigade (Lord\r\nPaget) 7th, 10th, and 15th Hussars. 1st Brigade (Warde) 1st and 3rd\r\nbatts. of the 1st Foot Guards. 2nd Brigade (Manningham) 3/1st, 1/26th,\r\n2/81st. 3rd Brigade (Leith) 51st, 2/59th, 76th. Light Brigade (R.\r\nCrawfurd) 2/43rd, 1/95th, 2/95th (detachments). The 2/14th and 2/23rd\r\nwere also present, perhaps as a brigade under Mackenzie.\r\n\r\nAll these arrangements were temporary, and at Sahagun, as we shall see,\r\nthe whole army was recast. A complete table of Moore’s army, with its\r\nfinal organization, force, and losses, will be found in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nThe march was a most unpleasant one, for the autumn rains surprised\r\nthe troops in their passage through the mountains. Moreover some of\r\nthe regiments were badly fed, as Sataro, the Portuguese contractor who\r\nhad undertaken to supply them with meat, went bankrupt at this moment\r\nand failed to fulfil his obligations. Nevertheless the advance was\r\ncarried out with complete success: the men were in good heart, marched\r\nwell, and generally maintained their[581] discipline. On November\r\n13 the leading regiments began to file into Salamanca, whither the\r\nCommander-in-chief had already preceded them. The concentration would\r\nhave been a little more rapid but for a strange mistake of General\r\nAnstruther, commanding at Almeida, who detained some of the troops for\r\na few days, contrary to the orders which had been sent him. But by the\r\ntwenty-third the three columns had all joined at Salamanca[582], where\r\nMoore now had 15,000 infantry and the solitary battery that had marched\r\nwith Fraser’s division. The guns had met with some tiresome obstacles,\r\nbut had surmounted them with no great difficulty, and Moore now saw\r\n(as we have already shown) that he might have brought the whole of his\r\nartillery with him, if only he had been given correct information as to\r\nthe state of the roads.\r\n\r\n  [581] Moore names one regiment only as an exception.\r\n\r\n  [582] Save two stray battalions, which had started last from\r\n  Lisbon.\r\n\r\nOn November 23, then, the British commander-in-chief lay at Salamanca,\r\nwith six infantry brigades and one battery. Baird lay at Astorga, with\r\nfour brigades and three batteries: a few of his battalions were still\r\non the march from Galicia. Hope, with Moore’s cavalry and guns, was\r\nnear the Escurial. Lord Paget with Baird’s equally belated cavalry,\r\nwhich had left Corunna on the fifteenth, was between Lugo and Astorga.\r\nThe situation was deplorable, for it was clear that the army would\r\nrequire ten days more to concentrate and get into full fighting order,\r\nand it was by no means certain that those ten days would be granted\r\nto it. Such were the unhappy results of the false direction given to\r\nHope’s column, and of the enforced delay of Baird at Corunna, owing to\r\nthe folly of the Galician Junta.\r\n\r\nIt may easily be guessed that Moore’s state of mind at this moment\r\nwas most unenviable. He had received, much at the same time as did\r\nBaird, the news of Gamonal and Espinosa. He was aware that no screen\r\nof Spanish troops now lay between him and the enemy. He had heard of\r\nthe arrival of Milhaud’s dragoons at Valladolid, and of Lefebvre’s\r\ncorps at Carrion, and he expected every moment to hear that they were\r\nmarching forward against himself. Yet he could not possibly advance\r\nwithout cavalry or guns, and if attacked he must fly at once towards\r\nPortugal, for it would be mad to attempt to fight in the plains with no\r\nforce at his disposition save a mass of foot-soldiery. If the French\r\nmoved forward from Valladolid to Zamora on the one side, or to Avila\r\non the other, he would inevitably be cut off from Baird and Hope.\r\nThere was no serious danger that any one of the three columns might be\r\ncaught by the enemy, if they halted at once, for each had a clear and\r\nsafe line of retreat, on Lisbon, Corunna, and Talavera respectively.\r\nBut if they continued their movement of concentration the case was\r\notherwise. To any one unacquainted with Bonaparte’s actual design of\r\nthrowing all his forces on Madrid by the Somosierra road, it looked\r\nnot only possible, but probable, that the enemy would advance westward\r\nas well as southward from his present positions, and if he did so the\r\ngame was up. The British army, utterly unable to concentrate, must fly\r\nin three separate directions. Moore and Hope might ultimately unite in\r\nfront of Lisbon: Baird might be shipped round from Corunna to the same\r\npoint. But this movement would take many weeks, and its moral effect\r\nwould be deplorable. What would be thought of the general who marched\r\nforward till he was within eighty miles of the French, and then ordered\r\na precipitate retreat, without even succeeding in concentrating his\r\narmy or firing a single shot? The thought filled Moore’s heart with\r\nbitterness: must he, with all his ability and with his well-earned\r\nreputation, swell the list of the failures, and be reckoned with the\r\nDuke of York, Dalrymple, and Hutchinson among the generals who were\r\ntoo late--who had their chance of fame, and lost it by being an hour,\r\nor a week, or a month behind the decisive moment? But on one point he\r\nwas clear: he must run no unnecessary risk with the forces committed\r\nto him: they were, as was once remarked, not _a_ British field-army,\r\nbut the only British field-army. Supposing they were destroyed, no\r\nsuch second host existed: it would take years to make another. There\r\nwere still many regiments on home service, but those which now lay at\r\nSalamanca and Astorga were the pick of the whole, the corps chosen for\r\nforeign service because they were the fittest for it.\r\n\r\nThe question, then, which Moore had to put to himself was whether he\r\nshould persist in attempting to complete the concentration of his army,\r\nand in case of success take an active part in the campaign, or whether\r\nhe should simply order each fraction of the British forces to retreat\r\nat once towards some safe base. The way in which the question should be\r\nanswered depended mainly on two points--what would be the movements of\r\nthe French during the next few days, and what Spanish troops existed\r\nto co-operate with the British army, in case it were determined to\r\ncommence active operations. For clearly the 30,000 men of Moore and\r\nBaird could not hope to struggle unaided against the whole French army\r\nin Spain.\r\n\r\nTo explain Moore’s action, it is necessary to remember that he started\r\nwith a strong prejudice against trusting the British army to the mercy\r\nof Spanish co-operation. He had been receiving very gloomy reports both\r\nfrom Mr. Stuart, the temporary representative of the British Government\r\nat Aranjuez, and from Lord William Bentinck, the military agent whom\r\nDalrymple had sent to Madrid. The latter was one of the few British\r\nofficers who (like Wellesley) foresaw from the first a catastrophe\r\nwhenever the French reinforcements should cross the Ebro[583]. Moreover\r\nthe character of Moore’s correspondence with the Central Junta, before\r\nand during his advance, had conspired with the reports of Stuart\r\nand Bentinck to give him a very unfavourable idea of the energy and\r\nadministrative capacity of our allies. He had been vexed that the\r\nJunta refused to put him in direct communication with the Spanish\r\ngenerals[584]. He complained that he got from them tardy, unfrequent,\r\nand inaccurate news of the enemy’s movements. He was disgusted that\r\nLopez, the officer sent to aid him in moving his troops, turned out\r\nto know even less about the roads of the Spanish frontier than he\r\ndid himself. But above all he professed that he was terrified by the\r\napathy which he found both among the officials and the people of the\r\nkingdom of Leon and Old Castile. He had been politely received by the\r\nauthorities both at Ciudad Rodrigo and at Salamanca, but he complained\r\nthat he got little but empty compliments from them.\r\n\r\n  [583] There is an undertone of gloom in most of Bentinck’s very\r\n  capable letters, which contrasts sharply with the very optimistic\r\n  views expressed by Doyle and most of the other military agents.\r\n  On Oct. 2 he ‘feels the danger forcibly’ of the want of a single\r\n  commander for the Spanish armies. On Sept. 30 he remarks that\r\n  ‘the Spanish troops consider themselves invincible, but that the\r\n  Spanish Government ought not to be deluded by the same opinion.’\r\n  On Nov. 14 ‘he must not disguise that he thinks very unfavourably\r\n  of the affairs of Spain: the Spaniards have not the means to\r\n  repel the danger that threatens’: most of his letters are in more\r\n  or less the same strain.\r\n\r\n  [584] Except with Castaños, from whom some sensible but rather\r\n  vague advice was procured.\r\n\r\nThere was some truth in this allegation, though certain facts can be\r\nquoted against it[585], even from Moore’s own correspondence. Leon and\r\nOld Castile had, as we have already had occasion to remark, been far\r\nless energetic than other parts of the Peninsula in raising new troops\r\nand coming forward with contributions to the national exchequer. They\r\nhad done no more than furnish the 10,000 men of Cuesta’s disorderly\r\n‘Army of Castile,’ a contingent utterly out of proportion with their\r\npopulation and resources. Nor did they seem to realize the scandal of\r\ntheir own sloth and procrastination. Moore had expected to see every\r\ntown full of new levies undergoing drill before marching to the Ebro,\r\nto discover magazines accumulated in important places like Ciudad\r\nRodrigo and Salamanca, to find the military and civil officials working\r\nbusily for the armies at the front. Instead he found an unaccountable\r\napathy. Even after the reports of Espinosa and Gamonal had come to\r\nhand, the people and the authorities alike seemed to be living in a\r\nsort of fools’ paradise, disbelieving the gloomy news that arrived, or\r\nat least refusing to recognize that the war was now at their own doors.\r\nMoore feared that this came from want of patriotism or of courage.\r\n\r\n  [585] e.g. in his letter of Nov. 19 Moore speaks of the town of\r\n  Salamanca as doing its best for him: the clergy were exerting\r\n  themselves, and a convent of nuns had promised him £5,000. In his\r\n  _Journal_ he has a testimonial to the fidelity with which the\r\n  people of Tordesillas protected an English officer from a raiding\r\n  party of French cavalry. There are some similar notes in British\r\n  memoirs: e.g. ‘T.S.’ of the 71st expresses much gratitude for the\r\n  kindness of the people of Peñaranda, who, when Hope’s division\r\n  arrived in a drenched and frozen condition, rolled out barrels of\r\n  spirits into the streets and gave every man a good dram before\r\n  the regiments marched on. Some towns, e.g. Zamora and Alba de\r\n  Tormes, behaved well in opposing (though without any hope of\r\n  success) the French, when they did appear.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the people’s hearts were sound enough[586], but\r\nthey had still got ‘Baylen on the brain’: they simply failed to\r\nrecognize the full horror of the situation. That their armies were\r\nnot merely beaten but dispersed, that the way to Madrid was open to\r\nBonaparte, escaped them. This attitude of mind enraged Moore. ‘In these\r\nprovinces,’ he wrote, ‘no armed force whatever exists, either for\r\nimmediate protection or to reinforce the armies. The French cavalry\r\nfrom Burgos, in small detachments, are overrunning the province of\r\nLeon, and raising contributions to which the inhabitants submit without\r\nthe least resistance: the enthusiasm of which we heard so much nowhere\r\nappears. Whatever good-will there is (and among the lower orders I\r\nbelieve there is a good deal) is taken no advantage of. I am at this\r\nmoment in no communication with any of their generals. I am ignorant\r\nof their plans, or those of their government[587].’ And again, he adds\r\nin despair, ‘I hope a better spirit exists in the southern provinces:\r\nhere no one stirs--and yet they are well inclined[588].’ While Leon\r\nand Old Castile were in this state of apathy, it was maddening to\r\nMoore to receive constant appeals from the Supreme Junta, begging that\r\nthe British army might move forward at once. Their dispatches were\r\naccompanied by representations, which Moore knew to be inaccurate,\r\nconcerning the numbers and enthusiasm of the Spanish armies still in\r\nthe field, and by misrepresentations of the force of the French. They\r\nwere also backed by urgent letters from Mr. Frere, the new ambassador\r\nat Madrid, urging him to give help at all costs.\r\n\r\n  [586] As to the conduct of the Spaniards I think that the\r\n  best commentary on it is that of Leith Hay (i. 80-1), who was\r\n  riding all over Castile and Leon in these unhappy weeks. ‘Thus\r\n  terminated a journey of about 900 miles, in which a considerable\r\n  portion of the country had been traversed, under circumstances\r\n  which enabled me to ascertain the sincere feeling of the people.\r\n  It is but justice to say that I met with but one sentiment as to\r\n  the war: that I was everywhere treated with kindness. I mention\r\n  this as a creditable circumstance to the inhabitants of the\r\n  Peninsula, and in contradiction to the statements often recorded,\r\n  unjustly in my opinion, as to the want of faith, supineness, and\r\n  perfidy of the Spanish people.... Their conduct was throughout\r\n  distinguished by good faith, if it was at the same time rendered\r\n  apparently equivocal from characteristic negligence, want of\r\n  energy, and the deficiency of that moral power that can alone be\r\n  derived from free institutions and an enlightened aristocracy.’\r\n\r\n  [587] Moore to Castlereagh from Salamanca, Nov. 24.\r\n\r\n  [588] Ibid., Dec. 8.\r\n\r\nThese appeals were intolerable to a man who dared not advance because\r\nhis army (partly by his own fault, partly owing to circumstances that\r\nhad not been under his control) was not concentrated. From the point\r\nof view of policy, Moore knew that it was all-important that he should\r\ntake the field: but, from the point of view of strategy, he saw that\r\nan advance with the 15,000 men that he had at Salamanca might very\r\nprobably lead to instant and complete disaster. He refused to move, but\r\nall the time he knew that his refusal was having the worst effect, and\r\nwould certainly be represented by his critics as the result of timidity\r\nand selfishness. It was this consciousness that caused him to fill\r\nhis dispatches with the bitterest comments on the Spanish government\r\nand people. He had been induced to advance to Salamanca, he said, by\r\nfalse pretences. He had been told that there was a large army in front\r\nof him, ready to cover his concentration. He had been informed that\r\nthe whole country-side was full of enthusiasm, that he might look for\r\nready help from every official, that when once he had crossed the\r\nfrontier transport and food would be readily provided for him. Instead,\r\nhe found nothing but apathy and disasters. ‘Had the real strength and\r\ncomposition of the Spanish armies been known, and the defenceless state\r\nof the country, I conceive that Cadiz, not Corunna, would have been\r\nchosen for the disembarkation of the troops from England: and Seville\r\nor Cordova, not Salamanca, would have been selected as the proper place\r\nfor the assembling of this army[589].’ Thus he wrote to Castlereagh:\r\nto Frere, in reponse to constant invitations to strike a blow of some\r\nsort in behalf of Spain, he replied in more vigorous terms[590].\r\n‘Madrid is threatened; the French have destroyed one army (Blake’s),\r\nhave passed the Ebro, and are advancing in superior numbers against\r\nanother (Castaños’), which from its composition promises no resistance,\r\nbut must retire or be overwhelmed. No other armed force exists in\r\nthis country: I perceive no enthusiasm or determined spirit among the\r\npeople. This is a state of affairs quite different from that conceived\r\nby the British Government, when they determined to send troops to the\r\nassistance of Spain. It was not expected that these were to cope alone\r\nwith the whole force of France: as auxiliaries they were to aid a\r\npeople who were believed to be enthusiastic, determined, and prepared\r\nfor resistance. It becomes therefore a question whether the British\r\narmy should remain to be attacked in its turn, or should retire from\r\na country where the contest, from whatever circumstances, is become\r\nunequal.’\r\n\r\n  [589] Moore to Castlereagh from Salamanca, Nov. 24.\r\n\r\n  [590] Moore to Frere from Salamanca, Nov. 27.\r\n\r\nAll that Moore wrote was true: yet, granting the accuracy of every\r\npremise, his conclusion that he ought to retire to Portugal was\r\nnot necessarily correct. The British Government had undoubtedly\r\nover-estimated the power and resources of Spain: the Supreme Junta had\r\nshown no capacity for organization or command: most of the Spanish\r\ngenerals had committed gross military blunders. But none of these\r\nfacts were enough to justify Moore in washing his hands of the whole\r\nbusiness, and marching out of Spain without firing a shot. He had\r\nnot been sent to help the patriots only if they were powerful and\r\nvictorious, to desert them if they proved weak and unlucky. If these\r\nhad been the orders issued to him by Castlereagh, all Bonaparte’s\r\ntaunts about the selfishness and timidity of the British Government\r\nwould have been justified. It was true that on his arrival at Salamanca\r\nhe found the aspect of the war very different from what he had expected\r\nat the moment of his quitting Lisbon. Instead of aiding the victorious\r\nSpanish armies to press up to the Pyrenees, he would have to cover\r\ntheir retreat and gain time for the reorganization of the scattered\r\nremnants of their first line of defence. To reject this task because\r\nthe Supreme Junta had been incapable, or Blake and Palafox rash and\r\nunskilful, would have been unworthy of a man of Moore’s talents and\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nYet in a moment of irritation at the mismanagement that he saw before\r\nhim, and of anger at the continual importunities that he was receiving\r\nfrom the Central Junta and from Mr. Frere, Moore nearly committed this\r\nfault. The last piece of news which broke down his resolution and drove\r\nhim to order a retreat was the account of the battle of Tudela. If he\r\nhad been forced to wait for the notification of this disaster through\r\nSpanish official sources, he might have remained ignorant of it for\r\nmany days. But Charles Vaughan, the secretary of Mr. Stuart, had been\r\nin the camp of Palafox, and had ridden straight from Tudela to Madrid,\r\nand from Madrid to Salamanca--476 miles in six days[591]. He brought\r\nthe intelligence of Castaños’ defeat to the English commander-in-chief\r\non the night of November 28. Moore lost not a moment in dictating\r\norders of retreat to the whole army. In the few hours that elapsed\r\nbefore midnight he gave his own troops directions to prepare to\r\nretire on Portugal, sent Hope a dispatch bidding him turn off on to\r\ncross-roads and move by Peñaranda on Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida, and\r\nwrote to Baird that he must return to Corunna, re-embark his army, and\r\nbring it round by sea to Lisbon.\r\n\r\n  [591] The notes and diaries of this ancient member of my own\r\n  College have been of enormous use to me for side-lights on\r\n  Spanish politics during 1808. His summary of his great ride from\r\n  Caparrosa in Navarre to Corunna, between November 21 and December\r\n  2, is perhaps worth quoting. ‘From Caparrosa to Madrid and from\r\n  Madrid to Salamanca, with the dispatches for Sir John Moore,\r\n  containing the defeat of the army commanded by General Castaños,\r\n  I rode post. I stayed the night at Salamanca, and at two o’clock\r\n  on the following day (Nov. 29) I set out for Astorga with\r\n  dispatches for Sir D. Baird, and with Sir J. Moore’s dispatches\r\n  for England. I was detained only six hours at Astorga, and after\r\n  riding two days and two nights on end arrived at Corunna the\r\n  evening of Dec. 2. The post-horses at every relay in Spain were\r\n  at this time so overworked that the journey was tiresome and\r\n  painful. I had ridden 790 miles from Caparrosa to Corunna in\r\n  eleven days (Nov. 21 to Dec. 2). I had a night’s rest at Agreda,\r\n  Cetina, and Salamanca, and two at Madrid.’ Deducting two days in\r\n  Madrid, the ride was really one of 790 miles in nine days.\r\n\r\nThe spirit in which Moore acted is shown by the wording of his letter\r\nto Hope:--‘I have determined to give the thing up, and to retire. It\r\nwas my wish to have run great risks to fulfil what I conceive to be\r\nthe wishes of the people of England, and to give every aid to the\r\nSpanish cause. But they have shown themselves equal to do so little for\r\nthemselves, that it would only be sacrificing this army, without doing\r\nany good to Spain, to oppose it to such numbers as must now be brought\r\nagainst us. A junction with Baird is out of the question, and with you,\r\nperhaps, problematical.... This is a cruel determination for me to\r\nmake--I mean to retreat: but I hope you will think the circumstances\r\nsuch as demand it[592].’\r\n\r\n  [592] Moore to Hope from Salamanca, Nov. 28.\r\n\r\nTo Moore, weighed down by the burden of responsibility, and worried by\r\nthe constant pressure of the Spaniards at Madrid, ‘who expected every\r\none to fly but themselves,’ this resolve to retreat seemed reasonable,\r\nand even inevitable. But it was clearly wrong: when he gave the order\r\nhe was overwrought by irritation and despondency. He was sent to\r\naid the Spaniards, and till he was sure that he could do absolutely\r\nnothing in their behalf, it was his duty not to abandon them. The\r\nBritish army was intended to be used freely in their cause, not to be\r\nlaid up--like the talent in the napkin--lest anything might happen to\r\nit. Its mere presence at Salamanca was valuable as an encouragement\r\nto the Spaniards, and a check on the free movement of the French.\r\nAbove all, it was not yet proved that the concentration with Baird\r\nand Hope was impossible: indeed, the events of the last few days were\r\nrendering it more and more likely that the junction might, after all,\r\ntake place. The French cavalry which had appeared at Valladolid had\r\ngone off southward, without any attempt to move in the direction of\r\nSalamanca. Soult and Lefebvre were also moving in a direction which\r\nwould not bring them anywhere near the British army. Hope had crossed\r\nthe Guadarrama unhindered, and was now near Villacastin, only seventy\r\nmiles from Moore’s head quarters. Under these circumstances it was most\r\nimpolitic to order an instant retreat. What would have been thought of\r\nMoore if this movement had been carried out, and if after the British\r\ncolumns had reached Corunna and Almeida the news had come that no\r\nFrench infantry had ever been nearer than fifty miles to them, that\r\ntheir concentration had been perfectly feasible, and that Napoleon had\r\npossessed no knowledge of their whereabouts? All these facts chanced\r\nto be true--as we have seen. The Emperor’s advance on Madrid was made\r\nwithout any reference to the British army, by roads that took him\r\nvery far from Salamanca: he was marching past Moore’s front in serene\r\nunconsciousness of his proximity. If, at the same moment, the British\r\nhad been hurrying back to Portugal, pursued only by phantoms hatched in\r\ntheir general’s imagination, it is easy to guess what military critics\r\nwould have said, and what historians would have written. Moore would\r\nhave been pronounced a selfish and timid officer, who in a moment of\r\npique and despondency deliberately abandoned his unhappy allies.\r\n\r\nFortunately for his own reputation and for that of England, his\r\noriginal intentions of the night of November 28 were not fully carried\r\nout. Only Baird’s column actually commenced its retrograde movement.\r\nThat general received Moore’s letter from Vaughan on the thirtieth, and\r\nimmediately began to retire on Galicia. Leaving his cavalry and his\r\nlight brigade at Astorga, to cover his retreat, he fell back with the\r\nrest of his division to Villafranca, fifty miles on the road towards\r\nCorunna. Here (as we shall see) he received on December 6 a complete\r\nnew set of orders, countermanding his retreat and bidding him return to\r\nthe plains of Leon.\r\n\r\nHope also had heard from Moore on the thirtieth, had been informed\r\nthat the army was to retire on Portugal, and was told to make forced\r\nmarches by Peñaranda and Ciudad Rodrigo to join his chief--unless\r\nindeed he were forced to go back by the way that he had come, owing to\r\nthe appearance of French troops in his path. Fortunately no such danger\r\noccurred: Hope arranged his two cavalry regiments as a screen in front\r\nof his right, in the direction of Arevalo and Madrigal. He hurried his\r\ninfantry and guns by Fontiveros and Peñaranda, along the road that\r\nhad been pointed out to him. The cavalry obtained news that patrols\r\nof French dragoons coming from the north had pushed as far as Olmedo\r\nand La Nava--some sixteen or eighteen miles from their outposts--but\r\ndid not actually see a single hostile vedette. This was lucky, as,\r\nif Napoleon had heard of a British force hovering on the flank of his\r\nadvancing columns, he would certainly have turned against it the troops\r\nthat were covering the right flank of his advance on Madrid--Lefebvre’s\r\ncorps and the dragoons of Milhaud. But, as it chanced, Hope was\r\nentirely unmolested: he moved, as was right, with his troops closed\r\nup and ready for a fight: on the night of the thirtieth his infantry\r\nactually slept in square without piling arms: during the ensuing\r\nthirty-six hours they marched forty-seven miles before they were\r\nallowed to encamp at Peñaranda. There they were practically in safety:\r\nslackening the pace for the exhausted infantry and for the over-driven\r\noxen of the convoy, Hope drew in to Alba de Tormes, where he was only\r\nfifteen miles from Salamanca[593]. Here he received orders not to push\r\nfor Ciudad Rodrigo, but to turn northward and join the main body of the\r\narmy, which was still--as it turned out--in its old positions. Thus on\r\nDecember 3 Moore could at last dispose of his long-lost cavalry and\r\nguns, and possessed an army of 20,000 men complete in all arms. This\r\nvery much changed the aspect of affairs for him, and removed one of his\r\nmain justifications for the projected retreat on Portugal. Hope also\r\nbrought information as to the movements of the French which was of the\r\nhighest importance. He reported that their columns were all trending\r\nsouthward, none of them to the west of Segovia. He had also heard of\r\nthe infantry of the 4th Corps, and could report that it had marched\r\nby Valladolid and Olmedo on Segovia, evidently with the intention of\r\ndriving Heredia’s Estremaduran troops out of the last-named city, and\r\nof opening the Guadarrama Pass[594]. There was no sign whatever of any\r\nmovement of the French in this quarter towards Salamanca. Thus the\r\nEmperor’s plan for a concentration of his whole army on Madrid became\r\nclear to Moore’s discerning eyes.\r\n\r\n  [593] There is a good, but short, account of this forced march,\r\n  in bitter cold, to be found in the memoir of ‘T.S.’ of the 71st,\r\n  one of Hope’s four infantry regiments. He speaks of a curious\r\n  fact that I have nowhere else seen mentioned, viz. that at\r\n  Peñaranda the artillery horses were so done up that Hope buried\r\n  six guns, and turned their teams to help the other batteries.\r\n  Apparently they were dug up a few days after by troops sent out\r\n  from Salamanca, as the tale of batteries is complete when Moore\r\n  resumed his march.\r\n\r\n  [594] I think that Napier (i. 287-8) somewhat exaggerates the\r\n  danger which Hope ran in his march from Villacastin to Alba de\r\n  Tormes. Of course if Lefebvre had been marching on Salamanca,\r\n  the situation would have been dangerous: but as a matter of\r\n  fact he was marching on the Guadarrama, which Hope had safely\r\n  passed on the twenty-eighth. Every mile that the British moved\r\n  took them further from Lefebvre’s route: his infantry was never\r\n  within fifty miles of Hope’s convoy: and supposing his brigade\r\n  of cavalry had got in touch with the British, it could have done\r\n  nothing serious against a force of all arms in the hands of a\r\n  very capable general. The ‘4,000 cavalry’ of which Napier speaks\r\n  were in reality only 1,500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMOORE’S ADVANCE TO SAHAGUN\r\n\r\n\r\nMoore’s determination to retreat on Portugal lasted just seven days.\r\nIt was at midnight on November 28-29 that he wrote his orders to Baird\r\nand Hope, bidding the one to fall back on Corunna and the other on\r\nCiudad Rodrigo. On the afternoon of December 5 he abandoned his scheme,\r\nand wrote to recall Baird from Galicia: on the tenth he set out on a\r\nvery different sort of enterprise, and advanced into the plains of Old\r\nCastile with the object of striking at the communications of the French\r\narmy. We have now to investigate the curious mixture of motives which\r\nled him to make such a complete and dramatic change in his plan of\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nHaving sent off his dispatches to Hope and Baird, the\r\nCommander-in-chief had announced next morning to the generals who\r\ncommanded his divisions and brigades his intention of retreating to\r\nPortugal. The news evoked manifestations of surprise and anger that\r\ncould not be concealed. Even Moore’s own staff did not succeed in\r\ndisguising their dismay and regret[595]. The army was looking forward\r\nwith eagerness to another campaign against the French under a general\r\nof such well-earned reputation as their present chief: a sudden order\r\nto retreat, when the enemy had not even been seen, and when his\r\nnearest cavalry vedettes were still three or four marches away, seemed\r\nastounding. There would have been remonstrances, had not Moore curtly\r\ninformed his subordinates that ‘he had not called them together to\r\nrequest their counsel, or to induce them to commit themselves to giving\r\nany opinion on the subject. He was taking the whole responsibility\r\nentirely upon himself: and he only required that they would immediately\r\nprepare to carry it into effect.’ In face of this speech there could be\r\nno argument or opposition: but there was murmuring in every quarter:\r\nof all the officers of the army of Portugal Hope is said to have been\r\nthe only one who approved of the Commander-in-chief’s resolve. The\r\nconsciousness of the criticism that he was undergoing from his own\r\nsubordinates did not tend to soften Moore’s temper, which was already\r\nsufficiently tried by the existing situation of affairs.\r\n\r\n  [595] See James Moore’s memoir of his brother, p. 72; compare\r\n  Napier, i. 292, and Lord Londonderry’s account of his own\r\n  observations at Salamanca, in his _History of the Peninsular\r\n  War_, i. 220, 221.\r\n\r\nAfter announcing this determination, it might have been expected that\r\nMoore would fall back at once on Almeida. But while beginning to send\r\nback his stores and his sick[596], he did not move his fighting-men:\r\nthe reason (as he wrote to Castlereagh[597]) was that he still hoped\r\nthat he might succeed in picking up Hope’s division, if the French did\r\nnot press him. Accordingly he lingered on, waiting for that general’s\r\napproach, and much surprised that the enemy was making no advance in\r\nhis direction. It was owing to the fact that he delayed his departure\r\nfor five days, on the chance that his lost cavalry and guns might after\r\nall come in, that Moore finally gained the opportunity of striking his\r\ngreat blow and saving his reputation.\r\n\r\n  [596] The heavy ammunition and all the sick who could be moved\r\n  were sent off on Dec. 5, under the escort of the 5/60th. See\r\n  Moore’s ‘General Orders’ for that day, and Ormsby, ii. 54.\r\n\r\n  [597] Moore to Castlereagh, from Salamanca, Nov. 29.\r\n\r\nDuring this period of waiting and of preparation to depart, appeals\r\nfrom many quarters came pouring in upon Moore, begging him to advance\r\nat all costs and make his presence felt by the French. The first\r\ndispatches which he received were written before his determination\r\nto retreat was known: after it was divulged, his correspondents only\r\nbecame the more importunate and clamorous. Simultaneous pressure was\r\nbrought to bear upon him by the British ambassador at Aranjuez, by\r\nthe Supreme Junta, by the general who now commanded the wrecks of the\r\nSpanish army of Galicia, and by the military authorities at Madrid.\r\nEach one of them had many and serious considerations to set before the\r\nharassed Commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nMoore had been so constantly asserting that Blake’s old ‘Army of the\r\nLeft’ had been completely dispersed and ruined, that it must have been\r\nsomewhat of a surprise to him when the Marquis of La Romana wrote\r\nfrom Leon, on November 30, to say that he was now at the head of a\r\nconsiderable force, and hoped to co-operate in the oncoming campaign.\r\nThe Galicians had rallied in much greater numbers than had been\r\nexpected: their losses in battle had not been very great, and the\r\nmen had dispersed from sheer want of food rather than from a desire\r\nto desert their colours. Their equipment was in the most wretched\r\ncondition, and their shoes worn out: but their spirit was not broken,\r\nand if they could get food and clothing, they were quite prepared to\r\ndo their duty. La Romana enclosed a dispatch of Soult’s which had been\r\nintercepted, and remarked that the news in it (apparently a statement\r\nof the marshal’s intention to move westward) made it advisable that\r\nthe English and Spanish armies should at once concert measures for a\r\njunction[598].\r\n\r\n  [598] La Romana to Moore, from Leon, Nov. 30.\r\n\r\nAll that the Marquis stated was perfectly true: his army was growing\r\nrapidly, for his muster-rolls of December 4 showed that he had already\r\n15,600 men with the colours, exclusive of sick and wounded: ten days\r\nlater the number had gone up to 22,800[599]. This was a force that\r\ncould not be entirely neglected, even though the men were in a dire\r\nstate of nakedness, and were only just recovering from the effects of\r\ntheir dreadful march from Reynosa across the Cantabrian hills. Moore\r\nhad always stated, in his dispatches to Castlereagh, that there was no\r\nSpanish army with which he could co-operate. He was now offered the aid\r\nof 15,000 men, under a veteran officer of high reputation and undoubted\r\npatriotism. The proposal to retreat on Portugal seemed even less\r\nhonourable than before, when it involved the desertion of the Marquis\r\nand his much-tried host.\r\n\r\n  [599] See the ‘morning states’ for the army of Galicia on Dec. 4\r\n  and Dec. 14, in Arteche (iv. 532, 533).\r\n\r\nNot long after the moment at which La Romana’s dispatch came to hand,\r\nthere arrived at Salamanca two officers deputed by the Central Junta\r\nto make a final appeal to Moore. These were Don Ventura Escalante,\r\nCaptain-General of the kingdom of Granada, and the Brigadier-General\r\nAugustin Bueno. They had started from Aranjuez on November 28, and\r\nseem to have arrived at the British head quarters on December 3 or\r\n4. They brought a letter from Don Martin de Garay, the secretary to\r\nthe Junta, stating that they were authorized to treat with Moore for\r\nthe drawing up of a plan of campaign, ‘by which the troops of his\r\nBritannic Majesty may act in concert with those of Spain, accelerating\r\na combined movement, and avoiding the delays that are so prejudicial\r\nto the noble enterprise in which the two nations are engaged[600].’\r\nThe proposal that the two generals made would appear to have been\r\nthat Moore should march on Madrid by the Guadarrama Pass, picking up\r\nHope’s division on the way, and ordering Baird to follow as best he\r\ncould. They wished to demonstrate to their despondent ally that it was\r\npossible to concentrate for the defence of Madrid a force sufficient\r\nto hold the Emperor at bay. If the British came up, they hoped even\r\nto be able to repulse him with decisive effect. They alleged that\r\nCastaños had escaped from Tudela with the Andalusian divisions almost\r\nintact, and must now be at Guadalajara, quite close to the capital,\r\nwith 25,000 good troops. Heredia, with the rallied Estremaduran army,\r\nwas at Segovia, and had 10,000 bayonets: San Juan with 12,000 men\r\nwas occupying the impregnable Somosierra. Andalusian and Castilian\r\nlevies were coming in to Madrid every day--they believed that 10,000\r\nmen must already be collected. This would constitute when united a\r\nmass of nearly 60,000 men: if Moore brought up 20,000 British troops\r\nall must go well, for Napoleon had only 80,000 men in the north of\r\nSpain. After deducting the army sent against Saragossa, and the\r\ndetachments at Burgos and in Biscay, as also the corps of Soult, he\r\ncould not have much more than 20,000 men concentrated for the attack\r\non Madrid. All this ingenious calculation was based on the fundamental\r\nmisconception that the French armies were only one-third of their\r\nactual strength--which far exceeded 200,000 men. But on this point\r\nMoore was as ill informed as the Spaniards themselves, and the causes\r\nwhich he alleged for refusing to march on Madrid had nothing to do with\r\nstatistics. He informed them that his reasons for proposing to retreat\r\non Portugal were that the Spanish armies were too much demoralized to\r\noffer successful resistance to the Emperor, and that the road to the\r\ncapital was now in the possession of the French. He then introduced\r\nColonel Graham, who had just returned from a meeting with San Juan,\r\nand had heard from him the story of the forcing of the Somosierra on\r\nNovember 29. Of this disaster Escalante and Bueno were still ignorant:\r\nthey had to learn from English lips that the French were actually\r\nbefore the gates of Madrid, that Heredia and San Juan were in flight,\r\nand that their junction with Castaños (wherever that general might\r\nnow be) had become impossible. This appalling news deeply affected\r\nEscalante and Bueno, but they then turned to urging Moore to unite\r\nwith La Romana, and march to the relief of Madrid. The British general\r\nreplied that he did not believe that the Marquis had 5,000 men fit to\r\ntake the field along with the British[601], and that any such scheme\r\nwould be chimerical. His whole bearing towards the emissaries of the\r\nJunta seems to have been frigid to the verge of discourtesy. How much\r\nthey irritated him may be gathered from the account of the interview\r\nwhich he sent to Mr. Frere two days later. In language that seems very\r\ninappropriate in an official dispatch--destined ere long to be printed\r\nas a ‘Parliamentary Paper’--he wrote: ‘The two generals seemed to me\r\nto be two weak old men, or rather women, with whom it was impossible\r\nfor me to concert any military operations, even had I been so inclined.\r\nTheir conferences with me consisted in questions, and in assertions\r\nwith regard to the strength of different Spanish corps, all of which I\r\nknew to be erroneous. They neither knew that Segovia or the Somosierra\r\nwere in the hands of the enemy. I shall be obliged to you to save me\r\nfrom such visits, which are very painful[602].’\r\n\r\n  [600] Martin de Garay to Moore, from Aranjuez, Nov. 28, 1808.\r\n\r\n  [601] This answer is recorded in the despairing appeal which\r\n  Escalante wrote to Moore from Calzada de Baños on Nov. 7, after\r\n  having started back to join the Junta. The rest of Moore’s\r\n  arguments can be gathered from his own dispatches.\r\n\r\n  [602] Moore to Frere, from Salamanca, Dec. 6, 1808.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the mission of Escalante and Bueno had no great\r\nshare in determining Sir John to abandon his projected retreat on\r\nPortugal, though it may possibly have had some cumulative effect when\r\ntaken in conjunction with other appeals that were coming in to him\r\nat the same moment. It was quite otherwise with the dispatches which\r\nhe received from the authorities at Madrid, and from the British\r\nambassador at Aranjuez: in them we may find the chief causes of his\r\nchanged attitude. The Madrid dispatch was written by Morla and the\r\nPrince of Castelfranco--the two military heads of the Junta of Defence\r\nwhich had been created on December 1--in behalf of themselves and\r\ntheir colleagues. It was sent off early on December 2, before Napoleon\r\nhad begun to press in upon the suburbs, for it speaks of the city as\r\nmenaced, not as actually attacked by the enemy. It amounted to an\r\nappeal to Moore to do something to help Madrid--not necessarily (as has\r\nbeen often stated) to throw himself into the city, but, if he judged\r\nit best, to manœuvre on the flank and rear of the Emperor’s army, so\r\nas to distract him from his present design. The writers stated, in\r\nmuch the same terms that Escalante and Bueno had used, that Castaños\r\nwith 25,000 men from Tudela and San Juan with 10,000 men from the\r\nSomosierra were converging on the capital, and added that the Junta had\r\ngot together 40,000 men for its defence. With this mass of new levies\r\nthey thought that they could hold off for the moment the forces that\r\nNapoleon had displayed in front of them; but when his reserves and\r\nreinforcements came up the situation would be more dangerous. Wherefore\r\nthey made no doubt that the British general would move with the\r\nrapidity that was required in the interests of the allied nations. They\r\nsupposed it probable that Moore had already united with La Romana’s\r\narmy, and that the two forces would be able to act together.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to think, with Napier and with Moore’s\r\nbiographer[603], that this dispatch was written by Morla with the\r\ntreacherous intent of involving the British army in the catastrophe\r\nthat was impending over the capital. Morla ultimately betrayed his\r\ncountry and joined King Joseph, but there is no real proof that he\r\ncontemplated doing so before the fall of Madrid. The letter was signed\r\nnot only by him but by Castelfranco, of whose loyalty there is no\r\ndoubt, and who was actually arrested and imprisoned by Bonaparte.\r\nMoreover, if it had been designed to draw Moore into the Emperor’s\r\nclutches, it would not have given him the perfectly sound advice to\r\nfall upon the communications of the French army after uniting with La\r\nRomana--the precise move that the British general made ten days later\r\nwith such effect. It would have begged him to enter Madrid, without\r\nsuggesting any other alternative.\r\n\r\n  [603] See James Moore (p. 86-7), where he vilely mistranslates\r\n  the letter--even rendering _corte_ by ‘country’; and Napier (i.\r\n  291), where the same accusation is formulated.\r\n\r\nMoore had always stated that his reluctance to advance into Spain had\r\nbeen due, in no small degree, to the apathy which he had found there:\r\nbut now the capital, as it seemed, was about to imitate Saragossa and\r\nto stand at bay behind its barricades. He had no great confidence\r\nin its power to hold out. ‘I own,’ he wrote to Castlereagh, ‘that I\r\ncannot derive much hope from the resistance of one town against forces\r\nso formidable, unless the spark catches and the flame becomes pretty\r\ngeneral[604].’ But he could realize the dishonour that would rest\r\nupon his own head if, as now seemed possible, Madrid were to make a\r\ndesperate resistance, and at the same moment the British army were to\r\nbe seen executing unmolested a tame retreat on Portugal. The letter of\r\nMorla and Castelfranco he might perhaps have disregarded, suspecting\r\nthe usual Spanish exaggerations, if it had stood alone. But it was\r\nbacked up by an appeal from the most important British sources. Mr.\r\nStuart, whose forecasts Moore had always respected because they were\r\nfar from optimistic[605], had written him to the effect that ‘the\r\nretrograde movements of the British divisions were likely to produce\r\nan effect not less serious than the most decisive victory on the part\r\nof the enemy.’ Frere, the newly arrived ambassador to the Central\r\nJunta, launched out into language of the strongest kind. He had already\r\ndiscovered that his opinions were fundamentally opposed to those of\r\nMoore: this was but natural, as the general looked upon the problem\r\nthat lay before him from a military point of view, while the ambassador\r\ncould only regard its political aspect. Any impartial observer can now\r\nsee that the advance of the British army into Spain was likely to be\r\na hazardous matter, even if Hope and Baird succeeded in joining the\r\nmain body at Salamanca. On the other hand, it is quite clear that the\r\nSpanish government would have every reason to regard itself as having\r\nbeen abandoned and betrayed, if that advance were not made. Balancing\r\nthe one danger against the other, it seems evident that Frere was\r\nright, and that it was Moore’s duty to make a diversion of some sort\r\nagainst the French. Executed on any day before Madrid fell, such a\r\nmovement would have disturbed Bonaparte and distracted him from his\r\nmain plan of operations. Nor would the operation have been so hazardous\r\nas Moore supposed, since his junction with Hope had become certain\r\nwhen that general reached Peñaranda, while Baird had never had any\r\nFrench troops in his neighbourhood. The retreat on Galicia was always\r\nopen: that on Portugal was equally available till the moment when the\r\ncapitulation of Madrid set free great masses of Bonaparte’s central\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\n  [604] Moore to Castlereagh, from Salamanca, Dec. 5.\r\n\r\n  [605] Stuart to Moore, from Madrid, Nov. 30.\r\n\r\nIn his earlier epistles to Moore Frere had deprecated the idea of a\r\nretreat, and had suggested that if for military reasons an advance\r\nshould be impracticable, it would at least be possible that the British\r\narmy might remain on Spanish ground. He had soon learnt that the\r\ngeneral entertained very different views, and his penultimate letter,\r\nthat of November 30, shows signs of pique at the small impression that\r\nhis arguments had made upon his correspondent[606]. Now on December\r\n3 he wrote from Talavera, whither he had followed the Supreme Junta\r\nin their flight, to try his last effort. To his previous arguments he\r\nhad only one more to add, the fact that on December 1-2 the people of\r\nMadrid were showing that spirit of fanatical patriotism which Moore\r\nhad sought in vain hitherto among the Spaniards. The populace, as he\r\nhad learnt, was barricading the streets and throwing up batteries:\r\n30,000 citizens and peasants were now under arms. Considering their\r\nspirit, he had no hesitation in taking upon himself the responsibility\r\nof representing the propriety, not to say the necessity, of doing\r\nsomething in their behalf. The fate of Spain depended absolutely, for\r\nthe moment, on some help being given by the British army. Frere had\r\nfirst-hand evidence of the enthusiasm which was reigning in Madrid\r\non the first day of December, having spoken to several persons who\r\nhad just left the capital, including a French _émigré_ colonel,\r\none Charmilly, to whose care he entrusted his last letter to the\r\nCommander-in-chief. But so convinced was he that no argument of his\r\nwould affect Sir John Moore, that he took a most improper step, and\r\nendeavoured to appeal to the public opinion of the army over the head\r\nof its general. He entrusted Charmilly with a second letter, which he\r\nwas only to deliver if Moore refused to countermand his retreat after\r\nreading the first. This document was a request that in case Sir John\r\nremained fixed in his original determination, he would allow the bearer\r\nof these letters to be examined before a Council of War. Frere thought\r\nthat Charmilly’s account of what was going on in Madrid would appeal\r\nto the Brigadiers, if it had no effect on the Lieutenant-General--and\r\nprobably he was not far wrong. Such a plan struck at the roots of all\r\nmilitary obedience: it could only have occurred to a civilian. If\r\nanything could have made the matter worse, it was that the document\r\nshould be entrusted not to a British officer but to a foreign\r\nadventurer, a kind of person to whom the breach between the civil and\r\nmilitary representatives of Great Britain ought never to have been\r\ndivulged. Moreover Charmilly (though Frere was not aware of this fact)\r\nchanced to be personally known to Moore, who had a very bad opinion\r\nof him[607]. The _émigré_ was said to have been implicated in the San\r\nDomingo massacres of 1794, and to have been engaged of late in doubtful\r\nfinancial speculations in London. To send him to Salamanca with such an\r\nerrand seemed like a deliberate insult to the Commander-in-chief. Frere\r\nwas innocent of this intention, but the whole business, even without\r\nthis aggravation, was most unwise and improper.\r\n\r\n  [606] ‘I do not know that I can in any way express with less\r\n  offence the entire difference of our opinions on this subject,\r\n  than by forwarding what I had already written, in ignorance of\r\n  the determination [to retreat] which you had already taken’\r\n  (Aranjuez, Nov. 30).\r\n\r\n  [607] He had called on Sir John a few days before, while on his\r\n  way to Madrid to solicit a military post from the Junta. Moore\r\n  wrote on Nov. 27 to Mr. Stuart, to say that he had seen him and\r\n  that ‘he never could help having a dislike to people of this\r\n  description.’\r\n\r\nCharmilly handed in his first document on the evening of December 5, a\r\nfew hours after Morla’s messenger had delivered the appeal from Madrid.\r\nMoore received him in the most formal way, dismissed him, and began\r\nto compare Frere’s information with that of the Junta of Defence, of\r\nthe emissaries from Aranjuez, and of his other English correspondents.\r\nPutting all together, he felt his determination much shaken: Madrid, as\r\nit seemed, was really about to defend itself: the preparations which\r\nwere reported to him bore out the words of Morla and Castelfranco.\r\nHis own army was seething with discontent at the projected retreat:\r\nHope being now only one march away, at Alba de Tormes, he could no\r\nlonger plead that he was unable to advance because he was destitute\r\nof cavalry and guns. Moreover, he was now so far informed as to the\r\nposition--though not as to the numbers--of the French, that he was\r\naware that there was no very serious force in front of himself or of\r\nBaird: everything had been turned on to Madrid. Even the 4th Corps, of\r\nwhich Hope had heard during his march, was evidently moving on Segovia\r\nand the Guadarrama.\r\n\r\nContemplating the situation, Moore’s resolution broke down: he knew\r\nwhat his army was saying about him at the present moment: he guessed\r\nwhat his government would say, if it should chance that Madrid made a\r\nheroic defence while he was retreating unpursued on Lisbon and Almeida.\r\nA man of keen ambition and soldierly feeling, he could not bear to\r\nthink that he might be sacrificing his life’s work and reputation to\r\nan over-conscientious caution. Somewhere between eight o’clock and\r\nmidnight on the night of December 5 he made up his mind to countermand\r\nthe retreat. He dashed off a short note to Castlereagh, and a dispatch\r\nto Baird, and the thing was done. To the war-minister he wrote that\r\n‘considerable hopes were entertained from the enthusiastic manner in\r\nwhich the people of Madrid resist the French.’ This hope he did not\r\nshare himself, but ‘in consequence of the general opinion, which is\r\nalso Mr. Frere’s, I have ordered Sir David Baird to suspend his march\r\n[to Corunna] and shall myself continue at this place until I see\r\nfurther, and shall be guided by circumstances.’ To Madrid he would not\r\ngo till he was certain that the town was making a firm defence, and\r\nthat the spirit of resistance was spreading all over Spain: but the\r\nplan of instant retreat on Portugal was definitely abandoned[608]. The\r\ndispatch to Baird shows even more of the General’s mind, for he and\r\nhis subordinate were personal friends, and spoke out freely to each\r\nother. The people of Madrid, Moore wrote, had taken up arms, refused\r\nto capitulate, and were barricading their streets--they said that they\r\nwould suffer anything rather than submit. Probably all this came too\r\nlate, and Bonaparte was too strong to be resisted. ‘There is, however,\r\nno saying, and I feel myself the more obliged to give it a trial, as\r\nMr. Frere has made a formal representation, which I received this\r\nevening. All this appears very strange and unsteady--but if the spirit\r\nof enthusiasm _does_ arise in Spain, and the people _will_ be martyrs,\r\nthere is no saying what our force may do.’ Baird therefore was to stay\r\nhis march on Corunna, to make arrangements to return to Astorga, and to\r\nsend off at once to join the main army one of his three regiments of\r\nhussars[609]. All this was written ere midnight: at early dawn Moore’s\r\nmind was still further made up. He sent to Sir David orders to push his\r\ncavalry to Zamora, his infantry, brigade by brigade, to Benavente, in\r\nthe plains of Leon. ‘What is passing at Madrid may be decisive of the\r\nfate of Spain, and we must be at hand to take advantage of whatever\r\nhappens. The wishes of our country and our duty demand it of us, with\r\nwhatever risk it may be attended.... But if the bubble bursts, and\r\nMadrid falls, we shall have a run for it.... Both you and me, though\r\nwe may look big, and determine to get everything forward, yet we must\r\nnever lose sight of this, that at any moment affairs may take the turn\r\nthat will render it necessary to retreat[610].’\r\n\r\n  [608] Moore to Castlereagh, from Salamanca, Dec. 5.\r\n\r\n  [609] Moore to Baird, from Salamanca, Dec. 5.\r\n\r\n  [610] Moore to Baird, from Salamanca, Dec. 6. The strange grammar\r\n  would seem to show that the letter was dashed off in a hurry, and\r\n  never revised.\r\n\r\nIf only Moore had discovered on November 13, instead of on December 5,\r\nthat events at Madrid were important, and that his country’s wishes and\r\nhis duty required him to take a practical interest in them, the winter\r\ncampaign of 1808 would have taken--for good or evil--a very different\r\nshape from that which it actually assumed. Meanwhile his resolve came\r\ntoo late. Madrid had actually capitulated thirty-six hours before he\r\nreceived the letters of Morla and of Frere. Moreover the offensive\r\ncould not be assumed till Baird should have retraced his steps from\r\nVillafranca, and returned to the position at Astorga from which his\r\nwholly unnecessary retreat had removed him.\r\n\r\nA painful and rather grotesque scene had to be gone through on the\r\nmorning of December 6. Colonel Charmilly had been received by Moore\r\non the previous night in such a dry and formal manner, that it never\r\noccurred to him that the letter which he had delivered was likely to\r\nhave had any effect. Accordingly he presented himself for the second\r\ntime next morning, with Frere’s supplementary epistle, taking it for\r\ngranted that retreat was still the order of the day, and making the\r\ndemand for the assembly of a Council of War. Moore, fresh from the\r\nsevere mental struggle which attended the reversal of all his plans,\r\nwas in no mood for politeness. Righteously indignant at what seemed to\r\nhim both a deliberate personal insult, and an intrigue to undermine\r\nhis authority with his subordinates, he burst out into words of anger\r\nand contempt, and told his provost-marshal to expel Charmilly from the\r\ncamp without a moment’s delay[611]. When this had been done, he sat\r\ndown to write a dispatch to Frere, in which his conscientious desire\r\nto avoid hard words with a British minister struggled in vain with\r\nhis natural resentment. He began by justifying his original resolve\r\nto retreat; and then informed his correspondent that ‘I should never\r\nhave thought of asking your opinion or advice, as the determination was\r\nfounded on circumstances with which you could not be acquainted, and\r\nwas a question purely military, of which I thought myself the best\r\njudge.’ When he made up his mind, the army had been hopelessly divided\r\ninto fractions, and there was good reason at that moment to fear that\r\nthe French would prevent their concentration. But as the resistance\r\nmade by the people of Madrid had deterred Bonaparte from detaching\r\nany corps against him, and the junction of the British divisions now\r\nseemed possible, the situation was changed. ‘Without being able to say\r\nexactly in what manner, everything shall be done for the assistance\r\nof Madrid, and the Spanish cause, that can be expected from an army\r\nsuch as I command.’ But Moore would not move till Baird came up, and\r\neven then, he said, he would only have 26,000 men fit for duty[612].\r\nBelieving that Frere’s conduct had been inspired by a regard for the\r\npublic welfare, he should abstain from any comment on the two letters\r\nbrought by Colonel Charmilly. But he must confess that he both felt\r\nand expressed much indignation at a person of that sort being made the\r\nchannel of communication between them. ‘I have prejudices against all\r\nthat class, and it is impossible for me to put any trust in him. I\r\nshall therefore thank you not to employ him in any communication with\r\nme[613].’\r\n\r\n  [611] Charmilly, greatly indignant, published a narrative of the\r\n  whole, in which he justified himself and his character. It does\r\n  not alter the main facts of the case.\r\n\r\n  [612] His muster-rolls show 33,000 troops in all, with 29,000\r\n  actually present with the colours, but Leith’s brigade and the\r\n  82nd, 2,539 men, were not up.\r\n\r\n  [613] Moore to Frere, Dec. 6. The version presented to Parliament\r\n  has been somewhat expurgated: I quote from that given by James\r\n  Moore.\r\n\r\nMoore had kept his temper more in hand than might have been expected,\r\nconsidering the provocation that he had received: the same cannot be\r\nsaid for Frere, whose next letter, written from Truxillo on December 9,\r\nended by informing the general that ‘if the British army had been sent\r\nabroad for the express object of doing the utmost possible mischief\r\nto the cause of Spain, short of actually firing upon the Spanish\r\ntroops, they would have most completely fulfilled their purpose by\r\ncarrying out exactly the measures which they have taken[614].’ This\r\nwas unpardonable language from one official writing a state paper\r\nto another, and it is regrettable to find that Frere made no formal\r\napology for it in his later dispatches. Even when he discovered that\r\nMoore was actually executing a diversion against the communications of\r\nthe French army, he only wrote that he was ‘highly gratified’ to find\r\nthat they were at last agreed on the advisability of such a move[615].\r\nFrere’s uncontrolled expressions showed that he was entirely unfit for\r\na diplomatic post, and cannot be too strongly reprobated. At the same\r\ntime we are forced to concede that his main thesis was perfectly true:\r\nnothing could have been more unhappy than that the aid of a British\r\narmy of 33,000 men should have been promised to Spain: that the army\r\nshould have marched late, in isolated divisions and by the wrong roads:\r\nthat after its van had reached Salamanca on November 13, it should not\r\nhave taken one step in advance up to December 5: that just as Madrid\r\nwas attacked it should tamely begin to retreat on Corunna and Lisbon.\r\nMoore was only partly responsible for all this: but it is certain\r\nthat the whole series of movements had in truth been calculated to do\r\nthe utmost possible mischief to the cause of Spain and of England.\r\nIf Moore had died or been superseded on December 4, 1808, he would\r\nhave been written down as wellnigh the worst failure in all the long\r\nlist of incompetent British commanders since the commencement of the\r\nRevolutionary War.\r\n\r\n  [614] Frere to Moore, from Truxillo, Dec. 9.\r\n\r\n  [615] Frere to Moore, from Merida, Dec. 14.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, with all the greater satisfaction that we now pass\r\non to the second part of the campaign of the British army in Spain,\r\nwherein Moore showed himself as resourceful, rapid, and enterprising as\r\nhe had hitherto appeared slow and hesitating. Having once got rid of\r\nthe over-caution which had hitherto governed his movements, and having\r\nmade up his mind that it was right to run risks, he showed that the\r\nhigh reputation which he enjoyed in the British army was well deserved.\r\n\r\nMoore’s first intention, as is shown by his orders to Baird and his\r\nletters to Castlereagh, was merely to disturb the French communications\r\nby a sudden raid on Valladolid, or even on Burgos. If Madrid was really\r\nholding out, the Emperor would not be able to send any large detachment\r\nagainst him, unless he made up his mind to raise the siege of the\r\ncapital. It was probable that Bonaparte would consider the destruction\r\nof an English army of even more importance than the prosecution of the\r\nsiege, and that he would come rushing northward with all his army. In\r\nthat case, as Moore wrote to Baird, ‘we shall have a run for it,’ but\r\nMadrid would be saved. In short, Napoleon was to be treated like the\r\nbull in the arena, who is lured away from a fallen adversary by having\r\na red cloak dangled before his eyes. Supposing that the main force of\r\nthe French were turned upon him, Moore was perfectly well aware that\r\nhis line of retreat on Portugal would be cut, for troops marching from\r\nthe neighbourhood of Madrid, via the Guadarrama Pass, might easily\r\nseize Salamanca. But it is one of the privileges of the possessor of\r\nsea-power that he can change his base whenever he chooses, and Moore\r\nwrote to Castlereagh to request that transports might be massed at\r\nCorunna for the reception of his army. If forced to fall back on that\r\nplace he intended to sail round to Lisbon or to Cadiz, as circumstances\r\nmight dictate.\r\n\r\nIn the unlikely event of Bonaparte’s persisting in the siege of Madrid,\r\nand sending only small detachments against the British army, Moore\r\nthought that he would be strong enough to make matters very unpleasant\r\nfor the enemy in Old Castile. If he beat the forces immediately\r\nopposed to him, and seized Valladolid and Burgos, the Emperor would be\r\ncompelled to come north, whether he wished it or no.\r\n\r\nAll these plans were perfectly reasonable and well concerted,\r\nconsidering the information that was at Moore’s disposition on December\r\n6. But that information was based on two false premises: the one was\r\nthat Madrid was likely to hold out for some little time--Moore never\r\nsupposed that it could be for very long, for he remained fixed in his\r\ndistrust of Spanish civic virtues: the second was that the French army\r\nin the north of Spain did not amount to more than 80,000 or 100,000\r\nmen, an estimate which had been repeated to him by every Spaniard with\r\nwhom he had communicated, and which had been confirmed, not only by\r\nFrere, but by Stuart and other English correspondents in whom he had\r\nsome confidence. If he had known that the French had entered Madrid\r\non December 4, and that they numbered more than 250,000 bayonets and\r\nsabres, his plans would have been profoundly modified[616].\r\n\r\n  [616] Moore’s plans between Dec. 6 and 10, the day on which he\r\n  got news of the fall of Madrid, must be gathered from his rather\r\n  meagre dispatches to Castlereagh of midnight, Dec. 5, and of Dec.\r\n  8; from his much more explicit letters to Frere on Dec. 6 and 10;\r\n  from that to La Romana on Dec. 8; and most of all from the very\r\n  interesting and confidential letters to Baird on Dec. 6 and 8.\r\n\r\n  His doubts as to the permanence of the outburst of enthusiasm\r\n  in Madrid are plainly expressed in nearly every one of these\r\n  epistles. The terrible under-estimate of Napoleon’s disposable\r\n  forces is to be found in that to Castlereagh on Dec. 12, where\r\n  he writes that ‘the French force in Spain may fairly be set down\r\n  at 80,000 men, besides what is in Catalonia.’ Acting upon this\r\n  hypothesis, it is no wonder that he was convinced that Bonaparte\r\n  could not both besiege Madrid and hunt the British army.\r\n\r\nMoore’s original intention was to move on Valladolid, a great centre\r\nof roads, and a sort of halfway-house between Burgos and Madrid.\r\nMeanwhile, Baird was to come down from Astorga via Benavente, and to\r\nconverge on the same point. A cavalry screen in front of the combined\r\nforce was formed, by pushing the two regiments which belonged to\r\nMoore’s own corps towards Alaejos and Tordesillas, on the south bank\r\nof the Douro; while Baird’s cavalry brigade, under Lord Paget, made a\r\nforced march from Astorga to Toro, and extended itself north of the\r\nriver. Moore’s infantry was not to move till the tenth, but that of\r\nBaird was already returning as fast as it could manage from Villafranca\r\nto Astorga. The unfortunate orders of retreat, issued on November 29,\r\nhad cost Sir David six marches, three from Astorga to Villafranca and\r\nthree from Villafranca to Astorga--time lost in the most miserable and\r\nunnecessary fashion. One of his brigades, that of General Leith[617],\r\nwas now so far off that it never managed to overtake the army, and was\r\nout of the game for something like a fortnight. But the rest, which had\r\nonly to return from Villafranca[618], succeeded in joining the main\r\nbody in much better time than might have been expected. The fact was\r\nthat the news of an advance had restored the high spirits of the whole\r\narmy, and the men stepped out splendidly through the cold and rainy\r\nwinter days, and easily accomplished their twenty miles between dawn\r\nand dusk.\r\n\r\n  [617] Consisting of the 51st Regiment, 59th (2nd batt.), and 76th.\r\n\r\n  [618] Except the ‘Light Brigade’ of Baird’s army which had never\r\n  left Astorga, having been intended to act with the cavalry as a\r\n  rearguard.\r\n\r\nMoore, meanwhile, was occupied at Salamanca in making the last\r\npreparations for his advance. He had already sent back into Portugal\r\none large convoy on December 5, escorted by the fifth battalion\r\nof the 60th Regiment. He now dispatched another which marched by\r\nCiudad Rodrigo, where it picked up the 3rd Foot, who guarded it\r\nback to Portugal[619]. The two between them contained all his heavy\r\nbaggage, and all the sick from his base hospital who could bear\r\ntransport--probably more than 1,500 invalids: for the total number of\r\nthe sick of the army was very nearly 4,000, and the larger half of them\r\nmust have belonged to Moore’s own corps, which was in worse trim than\r\nthat of Baird. The loss of the regiments sent off on escort duty was\r\npartly made up a few days later by the arrival of the 82nd, which came\r\nup by forced marches from Oporto, and reached Benavente on December\r\n26. It was the leading battalion of a brigade which the government\r\nhad resolved to add to Moore’s force from the slender division of\r\nCradock: the other two battalions of the brigade were too far behind,\r\nand never succeeded in joining the field-army[620]. Allowing for these\r\nfinal changes we find that Moore and Baird started forth with 29,946\r\neffective sabres and bayonets--in which are included 1,687 men on\r\ndetachment: they left behind them nearly 4,000 sick[621]. If we deduct\r\n2,539 for Leith’s brigade, which was still far beyond Villafranca, and\r\nfor the belated 82nd, the actual force which carried out the great raid\r\ninto the plain of Old Castile must have been just over 25,000 strong:\r\nof these 2,450 were cavalry, and there were 1,297 artillery gunners and\r\ndrivers with sixty-six guns.\r\n\r\n  [619] The 3rd had been at Ciudad Rodrigo since Oct. 29 guarding\r\n  communications.\r\n\r\n  [620] They were the 45th (1st batt.) and the 97th.\r\n\r\n  [621] See the tables in the Appendix. It seems to result that the\r\n  gross total who marched from Corunna and Lisbon was 33,884, that\r\n  the deduction of 3,938 sick leaves 29,946. Leith’s battalions and\r\n  the 82nd were 2,539 strong, the men on detachment 1,687: this\r\n  leaves 25,720 for the actual marching force.\r\n\r\nMoore had, of course, given notice to La Romana of his change of plan:\r\nin response to his letter of December 6 the Marquis expressed his\r\npleasure at the prospect of the union of the allied armies, and his\r\nwish to co-operate to the best of his power[622]. He had now collected\r\n20,000 men--a formidable army on paper--and was certain to do his best,\r\nbut what that might amount to was very doubtful. It was well known that\r\na great part of his troops were not fit to move: but it was not till\r\na few days later that Moore received definite intelligence as to the\r\nexact amount of military aid that might be furnished by the army of the\r\nLeft.\r\n\r\n  [622] As Arteche very truly observes, the letter of La Romana\r\n  cannot be safely quoted (after the fashion of James Moore on his\r\n  p. 122) as approving of the retreat on Portugal. He is answering\r\n  the dispatch of Dec. 6, not that of Nov. 28.\r\n\r\nThe British troops were fully committed to their new plan of\r\ncampaign--Baird was hastening back to Astorga, the sick and the\r\nconvoys had started for Portugal, the cavalry had pushed well to the\r\nfront--when Moore suddenly received a piece of intelligence which\r\nprofoundly modified the situation. Madrid had fallen into the hands of\r\nBonaparte: the news was brought by Colonel Graham, who had been sent\r\noff with the reply to Morla and Castelfranco. Forced to make a long\r\ndetour, because all the direct roads were known to be in the hands of\r\nthe French, he had fallen in at Talavera with the fugitive army from\r\nthe Escurial, and had almost witnessed the murder of San Juan. From\r\ninformation given him by various persons, and especially by two belated\r\nmembers of the Central Junta, he learnt that Napoleon had stormed the\r\nRetiro and the Prado, and that Morla had signed a capitulation. The\r\npopulace were said to be still in possession of their arms, and it was\r\nsupposed that there would be much trouble in pacifying the city; but\r\nthere was no doubt that, from a military point of view, it was in the\r\nEmperor’s power[623].\r\n\r\n  [623] Graham to Moore, from Talavera, Dec. 7-8.\r\n\r\nConsidering Moore’s earlier doubts and hesitations, we should almost\r\nhave expected that this news would have induced him to throw up his\r\nwhole plan for an advance into Old Castile, and once more to order\r\na retreat on Almeida. But he evidently considered that he was now\r\ncommitted to the raid on Bonaparte’s lines of communication, and\r\nthought that, even if he could not save Madrid, he could at least\r\ndistract the enemy from an attempt to push further south, and give\r\nthe Spanish armies time to rally. There was a chance, as he wrote to\r\nCastlereagh[624], that he might effect something, and he should take\r\nit, committing himself to Fortune: ‘If she smiles we may do some good:\r\nif not, we shall still I hope have the merit of having done all that we\r\ncould. The army, for its numbers, is excellent, and is (I am confident)\r\nquite determined to do its duty.’\r\n\r\n  [624] Moore to Castlereagh, from Salamanca, Dec. 10.\r\n\r\nOn December 11 the infantry at last began to move forward from\r\nSalamanca--a month all but two days had elapsed since its vanguard\r\nreached that city. On that day the reserve division, under General\r\nE. Paget, and Beresford’s brigade of Fraser’s division marched for\r\nToro, where they found Lord Paget with Baird’s cavalry, ready to\r\ncover their advance. These troops were to form the left-hand column\r\nof the advance on Valladolid. On the next day Hope’s detachment from\r\nAlba de Tormes, and the brigades of Bentinck, Fane, Hill, and Charles\r\nAlten from Salamanca, which formed the right-hand column, marched\r\nfor Alaejos and Tordesillas. In front of them was Charles Stewart’s\r\ncavalry brigade, which, on the same evening (December 12), fell upon\r\na French cavalry patrol at Rueda and captured it whole, only one man\r\nescaping. The prisoners turned out to belong to the 22nd Chasseurs\r\ncf Franceschi’s cavalry division, which, as it was discovered, lay\r\nat Valladolid without any infantry supports[625]. They expressed the\r\ngreatest surprise at finding themselves assailed by English cavalry,\r\nas they were under the impression that Moore had retired on Lisbon\r\nsome days before. This side-light on the general ignorance prevailing\r\nin the French army as to the position and designs of the British was\r\nvery valuable: the first meeting with the enemy, trifling as was the\r\nsuccess, promised well for the future.\r\n\r\n  [625] There were thirty of these dragoons: with them were fifty\r\n  infantry, apparently a belated detail or foraging party from\r\n  Lefebvre’s corps.\r\n\r\nOn the thirteenth Moore himself came up from Salamanca to Alaejos,\r\nwhere he overtook the infantry. Stewart’s cavalry meanwhile pushed on\r\nto Tordesillas and Medina del Campo, without coming across any traces\r\nof the French. At Tordesillas they found themselves in touch with Lord\r\nPaget’s horsemen on the other side of the Douro, who had also met\r\nwith no opposition whatever. On the fifteenth the whole army would\r\nhave converged on Valladolid, if Moore’s original intention had been\r\ncarried out. But a fortunate accident intervened to prevent this march,\r\nwhich would have placed the British troops nearer to Madrid and to the\r\nEmperor than did the route which they finally adopted.\r\n\r\nThere was brought to Moore at Alaejos an intercepted dispatch from\r\nBerthier to Soult, containing the most valuable information. The\r\nofficer bearing it had been sent off from Madrid without an escort,\r\naccording to the Emperor’s usual habit--a habit that cost the lives\r\nof some scores of unfortunate aides-de-camp during the first year of\r\nthe Peninsular War. It was only by experience that Napoleon and his\r\nmarshals learnt that isolated officers travelling in this fashion were\r\ndevoted in Spain to probable death and possible torture, as Marbot\r\n(after a personal experience of the kind) bitterly observed. The bearer\r\nof this particular dispatch had been murdered by peasants at the\r\npost-house of Valdestillos, near Segovia.\r\n\r\nThe document was full of invaluable facts and details. It informed\r\nSoult that with his existing force--the two infantry divisions of\r\nMerle and Mouton, and the four cavalry regiments of Franceschi’s\r\ndivision[626]--he was strong enough to march straight before him from\r\nSaldaña, and to overrun the whole kingdom of Leon. He was to seize the\r\ntowns of Leon, Zamora, and Benavente, and to sweep the débris of the\r\narmy of Galicia into its native mountains. He would find nothing else\r\nto oppose him; for the English, as all accounts agreed, were in full\r\nretreat on Lisbon. They had last been heard of at Salamanca and the\r\nEscurial. A knowledge of this plan was valuable to Moore, but still\r\nmore so was what followed--a sketch of the position of the French army\r\nat the moment when the dispatch was written. The advanced guard of the\r\n‘Grand Army’ (Lefebvre’s corps) was at Talavera, and would shortly be\r\nat Badajoz: Bessières was chasing Castaños beyond the Upper Tagus, on\r\nthe road to Valencia. Mortier’s and Junot’s corps had reached Spain:\r\nthe former had been ordered off to aid in the siege of Saragossa: the\r\nlatter was on the march to Burgos, and its leading division had reached\r\nVittoria. The chief omission was that Berthier did not mention the\r\nImperial Guard or the corps of Ney, which were in or about Madrid when\r\nhe wrote, and were probably destined to follow Lefebvre’s march on\r\nBadajoz and Lisbon. The dispatch ends with the curious note that ‘His\r\nMajesty is in the best of health. The city of Madrid is quite tranquil:\r\nthe shops are open, theatrical amusements have been resumed, and you\r\nwould never suppose that our first addresses to the place had been\r\nemphasized by 4,000 cannon-balls[627].’\r\n\r\n  [626] Berthier speaks as if Mouton were still commanding one of\r\n  Soult’s divisions, but he was now gone, and Mermet’s name ought\r\n  to appear.\r\n\r\n  [627] This dispatch, though often published, has been\r\n  deliberately omitted (like some others) in the _Correspondance de\r\n  Napoléon_, vol. xviii, probably because it shows the Emperor in\r\n  one of his least omniscient moods.\r\n\r\nMoore was thus placed in possession of the Emperor’s plan of campaign,\r\nand of the dislocation of the greater part of his army. Most important\r\nof all, he discovered that his own position and designs were wholly\r\nunsuspected. His mind was soon made up: Soult, as it seemed, with his\r\n15,000 or 16,000 men at Saldaña and Carrion, was about to move forward\r\ninto Leon. He would thus be placed at an enormous distance from the\r\nEmperor, and would have no solid supports save the leading division\r\nof Junot’s corps, which must now be drawing near to Burgos. If he\r\nadvanced, the whole British army, aided by whatever troops La Romana\r\ncould produce, might be hurled upon him. The results could not be\r\ndoubtful, and a severe defeat inflicted on the 2nd Corps would shake\r\nthe hold of the French on Northern Spain, and ruin all the Emperor’s\r\nplans. Moreover the region where Soult might be looked for, about\r\nCarrion, Sahagun, and Mayorga, was far more remote from Madrid than the\r\nValladolid country, where Moore was originally intending to strike his\r\nblow, so that several days would be gained before the Emperor could\r\ninterfere.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on December 15, the whole army suddenly changed its\r\ndirection from eastward to northward. The left-hand column of the\r\ninfantry crossed the Douro at Zamora, the right-hand column at\r\nToro. The cavalry, screening the march of both, went northward from\r\nTordesillas to the banks of the Sequillo, pushing its advanced parties\r\nright up to Valladolid, and driving back the dragoons of Franceschi,\r\nseveral of whose detachments they cut off, capturing a colonel and\r\nmore than a hundred men. They intercepted the communications between\r\nBurgos and Madrid to such effect that Bonaparte believed that the whole\r\nBritish army was moving on Valladolid, and drew up his first plan of\r\noperations under that hypothesis[628].\r\n\r\n  [628] It is clear from _Nap. Corresp._, 14,614, 14,616-7, that\r\n  Franceschi actually evacuated Valladolid and retired northwards.\r\n  Napoleon at first believed that Moore had occupied the place:\r\n  but 14,620 mentions that no more happened than that 100 hussars\r\n  swooped down on it on Dec. 19, and carried off the intendant\r\n  of the province and 300,000 reals (£3,000) from the treasury.\r\n  This exploit is omitted by nearly every English writer. Only\r\n  Vivian mentions it in his diary, and says that the lucky captors\r\n  belonged to the 18th Hussars (_Memoirs_, p. 94). What became of\r\n  the money?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile four good marches [December 16-20] carried Moore’s infantry\r\nfrom Zamora and Toro by the route Villalpando-Valderas to Mayorga.\r\nThe weather was bitterly cold, which in one way favoured the movement,\r\nfor the frost hardened the country roads, which would otherwise have\r\nbeen mere sloughs of mud. A little snow fell from time to time, but\r\nnot enough to incommode the troops. They marched well, kept their\r\ndiscipline, and left few sick or stragglers behind. This was the result\r\nof good spirits, for they had been told that they would meet the French\r\nbefore the week was out. At Mayorga the junction with Baird’s column\r\nwas safely effected.\r\n\r\nWhen the army had thus completed its concentration, Sir John Moore,\r\nfor reasons which it is not quite easy to understand, rearranged all\r\nits units. He formed it into four divisions and two independent\r\nlight brigades. The 1st Division was given to Sir David Baird, the\r\n2nd to Sir John Hope, the 3rd to General Fraser, the 4th (or Reserve)\r\nto General E. Paget. The two light brigades were under Charles Alten\r\nand Robert Crawfurd (now as always to be carefully distinguished from\r\nCatlin Crawfurd, who commanded a brigade of Hope’s division). All the\r\nold arrangements of the army of Portugal were broken up: Baird was\r\ngiven three regiments which had come from Lisbon: on the other hand\r\nhe had to make over four of his Corunna battalions to Hope and two to\r\nFraser. Apparently the idea of the Commander-in-chief was to mix the\r\ncorps who had already had experience of the French in Portugal with\r\nthe comparatively raw troops who had landed in Galicia. Otherwise it\r\nis impossible to understand the gratuitous divorce of regiments which\r\nhad been for some time accustomed to act together. The cavalry was\r\nformed as a division of two brigades under Lord Paget: the three hussar\r\nregiments from Corunna formed one, under General Slade; the two corps\r\nfrom Lisbon the other, under Charles Stewart, the brother of Lord\r\nCastlereagh. Of the whole army only the 82nd and Leith’s brigade were\r\nstill missing: the former had not yet reached Benavente. The belated\r\nregiments of the latter were still on the further side of Astorga, and\r\nnever took any part in the advance.\r\n\r\nDuring this march Moore at last got full information as to the state\r\nof La Romana’s troops, and the aid that might be expected from them.\r\nThe Marquis himself, writing to contradict a false report that he\r\nwas retiring on Galicia, confessed that two-thirds of his 20,000 men\r\nwanted reclothing from head to foot, and that there was a terrible\r\nwant of haversacks, cartridge-boxes, and shoes. He complained bitterly\r\nthat the provinces (i.e. Asturias and Galicia) were slack and tardy\r\nin forwarding him supplies, and laid much of the blame on them[629].\r\nBut he would move forward the moment he could be assisted by Baird’s\r\ntroops in pressing the French in his front. He reported that Soult had\r\n10,000 infantry at Saldaña, Carrion, and Almanza, with cavalry out in\r\nadvance at Sahagun: he dared not move across their front southward, for\r\nto do so would uncover the high-road through Leon to the Asturias. But\r\nthe appearance of Baird on the Benavente-Palencia road should be the\r\nsignal for him to advance against the French in conjunction with his\r\nallies[630].\r\n\r\n  [629] Toreño, being an Asturian, is rather indignant at Romana’s\r\n  reflection on the Junta of his province, and observes (i. 324)\r\n  that the Marquis did not take the trouble to ask for help from\r\n  them, only writing them a single letter during his stay at Leon.\r\n  But they sent him some tents, and took in some of his sick. From\r\n  Galicia there was coming for him an enormous convoy with 100\r\n  wagons of English boots and clothes: but it was three weeks too\r\n  late, and had only reached Lugo by Jan. 1.\r\n\r\n  [630] Romana to Moore, from Leon, Dec. 14.\r\n\r\nRomana’s description of his army did not sound very promising. But\r\na confidential report from an English officer who had visited his\r\ncantonments gave an even less favourable account of the Galicians.\r\nColonel Symes had seen four of the seven divisions which formed the\r\n‘Army of the Left.’ He wrote that the soldiers were ‘in general, stout\r\nyoung men, without order or discipline, but not at all turbulent\r\nor ferocious. Their clothing was motley, and some were half-naked.\r\nTheir manœuvres were very confusedly performed, and the officers were\r\ncomparatively inferior to the men. The equipment was miserable: of\r\nsixteen men of General Figueroa’s guard only six had bayonets. The\r\nsprings and locks of the muskets often did not correspond. A portion\r\nof them--at least one-third--would not explode, and a French soldier\r\ncould load and fire his piece with precision thrice, before a Spaniard\r\ncould fire his twice.’ Of the three divisions which he saw reviewed at\r\nLeon, one (the 5th, the old troops from the Baltic) seemed superior to\r\nthe rest, and was armed with good English firelocks: there was also\r\na corps of light troops, 1,000 men in uniform, who might be called\r\nrespectable[631].... Without undervaluing the spirit of patriotism of\r\nthe Spaniards, which might in the end effect their deliverance, the\r\nwriter of the report could only say that they were not, and for a very\r\nlong time could not be, sufficiently improved in the art of war to\r\nbe coadjutors in a general action with the British: if any reliance\r\nwere placed on Spanish aid in the field, terrible disappointment must\r\nresult: ‘we must stand or fall through our own means[632].’ Colonel\r\nSymes doubted whether La Romana would even dare to take his troops into\r\nthe field at all--wherein he did the Marquis grave injustice: he had\r\nevery intention of doing his best--though that best turned out to be\r\nmerely the bringing to the front of the 7,000 or 8,000 men out of his\r\n22,000, who were more or less armed and equipped, while the rest were\r\nleft behind as wholly unserviceable.\r\n\r\n  [631] Possibly the two light infantry battalions (Catalonia and\r\n  Barcelona) of the Baltic division.\r\n\r\n  [632] Symes to Baird, from Leon, Dec. 14. Baird, of course,\r\n  forwarded the letter to Moore. I have cut down the report to\r\n  one-third of its bulk, by omitting the less important parts.\r\n\r\nWith this document before him, Moore must have found a certain grim\r\nhumour in the perusal of a letter from the Supreme Junta, which reached\r\nhim at Toro on December 16, informing him that La Romana would join him\r\nwith 14,000 ‘picked men,’ and that within a month 30,000 more Asturian\r\nand Galician levies should be at his disposal. This communication was\r\nbrought to him by Francisco Xavier Caro, the brother of the Marquis,\r\nwho was himself a member of the Junta. With him came Mr. Stuart, as\r\nan emissary from the British minister, bringing the last of those\r\nunhappy epistles which Frere had written before he knew that the plan\r\nof retreating on Portugal had been given up. We have already quoted one\r\nof its insulting phrases on page 524: the rest was in the same strain.\r\nFortunately, it could be disregarded, as Moore was actually advancing\r\non the enemy, with a definite promise of help from La Romana. Caro\r\nprofessed to be much delighted that the Junta’s hopes were at last\r\nobtaining fruition. Stuart expressed surprise and grief at the tone of\r\nFrere’s letters, and ‘seemed not much pleased at his mission[633].’\r\nThis was the last of the many troubles with the British and Spanish\r\ncivil authorities which were destined to harass the Commander-in-chief.\r\nFor the future it was only military cares that were to weigh upon his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n  [633] Moore’s diary, quoted in his brother’s memoir of him, pp.\r\n  141, 142.\r\n\r\nOn December 20 the army had concentrated at Mayorga. Somewhat to his\r\ndisappointment Moore discovered that Soult had not begun the advance\r\non Leon which Berthier’s intercepted dispatch had ordered. Either\r\nno duplicate of it had been received by the Marshal, or he had been\r\ndisconcerted by the report that the English were on the move for\r\nValladolid. That they were coming against his own force he can as yet\r\nhardly have guessed. He was still in his old position, one infantry\r\ndivision at Saldaña, the other at Carrion. Debelle’s light-cavalry\r\nbrigade lay in front as a screen, with its head quarters at Sahagun,\r\nonly nine miles from the English advanced pickets, which had reached\r\nthe abbey of Melgar Abaxo.\r\n\r\nThe proximity of the enemy led Lord Paget, who showed himself\r\nthroughout the campaign a most admirable and enterprising cavalry\r\ncommander, to attempt a surprise. Marching long ere dawn with the\r\n10th and 15th Hussars, he reached the vicinity of Sahagun without\r\nbeing discovered. Debelle had no outlying vedettes, and his main-guard\r\non the high-road was suddenly surrounded and captured before it was\r\naware that an enemy was near. Only a single trooper escaped, but he\r\naroused the town, and Paget, hearing the French trumpets sounding in\r\nthe streets, saw that he must lose no time. He sent General Slade with\r\nthe 10th Hussars by the straight road into Sahagun, while he himself\r\ngalloped around it with the 15th to cut off the enemy’s retreat. As he\r\nreached the suburb he found Debelle forming up his two regiments--the\r\n8th Dragoons and the 1st Provisional Chasseurs--among the snow-covered\r\nstumps of a vineyard. Nothing could be seen of the 10th, which was\r\nscouring the town, but Paget formed up the 15th for a charge. His first\r\nmovement was checked by an unexpected ditch; but moving rapidly down\r\nit he crossed at a place where it was practicable, and found Debelle\r\nchanging front to meet him. Catching the French before they had begun\r\nto move--their new formation was not yet quite completed--Paget charged\r\ninto them without hesitation, though they outnumbered him by nearly two\r\nto one. He completely rode down the front regiment, the provisional\r\nchasseurs, and flung it back on to the dragoons, who broke and fled.\r\nThe chasseurs, who were commanded by Colonel Tascher, a cousin of\r\nthe Empress Josephine, were half destroyed: two lieutenant-colonels,\r\neleven other officers, and 157 men were taken prisoners, twenty were\r\nkilled, many were wounded[634]. The regiment indeed was so mauled that\r\nBonaparte dissolved it soon after, and replaced it in Franceschi’s\r\ndivision by the 1st Hussars, which had just arrived from France.\r\n\r\n  [634] Compare Lord Londonderry (a participator in the charge),\r\n  Vivian, Adam Neale, and on the French side, Colonel St. Chamans,\r\n  Soult’s aide-de-camp. The British lost only 14 men (Vivian, p.\r\n  97).\r\n\r\nThis was perhaps the most brilliant exploit of the British cavalry\r\nduring the whole six years of the war. When the Peninsular medals were\r\ndistributed, nearly forty years after, a special clasp was very rightly\r\ngiven for it, though many combats in which a much larger number of men\r\nwere engaged received no such notice. While reading the records of\r\nlater stages of the war the historian must often regret that Wellington\r\nnever, till Waterloo, had the services of Paget as commander of his\r\nlight cavalry. There were unfortunate personal reasons which rendered\r\nthe presence of the victor of Sahagun and Benavente impossible in the\r\ncamp of the victor of Vimiero[635].\r\n\r\n  [635] After his return from Spain in January, 1809, Paget\r\n  eloped with the wife of Henry Wellesley, the younger brother of\r\n  Wellington. Naturally they could not be placed together for many\r\n  years, and Paget lost his chance of seeing any more of the war.\r\n  But at Waterloo he gloriously vindicated his reputation as the\r\n  best living British cavalry-officer.\r\n\r\nThe scared survivors of Debelle’s brigade rode back to give Soult\r\nnotice that the enemy was upon him, and might close in on the very\r\nnext day. Meanwhile Moore’s infantry, following in the wake of Paget’s\r\nhorse, reached Sahagun on the evening of the twenty-first. It was to\r\nbe almost their last step in advance. The general allowed one day’s\r\nrest to enable the rear divisions to close up to the van, so that all\r\nmight advance on Saldaña and Carrion in a compact mass. He intended to\r\ndeliver his much-desired blow at Soult upon the twenty-third.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Dalmatia, though he had heard nothing as yet of the British\r\ninfantry, made the right inference from the vigorous way in which his\r\ncavalry had been driven in, and concluded that Moore was not far off.\r\nHe drew down his second infantry division from Saldaña to Carrion,\r\nthus concentrating his corps, and sent aides-de-camp to Burgos and\r\nPalencia to hurry up to his support every regiment that could be found.\r\nThe disposable troops turned out to be Lorges’s division of dragoons,\r\nand Delaborde’s division of the 8th Corps, which were both on their\r\nway from Burgos to Madrid. The rest of Junot’s infantry was two days\r\noff, on the road from Vittoria to Burgos. The brigade of Franceschi’s\r\ncavalry which had evacuated Valladolid, was also heard of on the\r\nPalencia road. No news or orders had been received from Madrid, with\r\nwhich place communication was now only possible by the route of Aranda,\r\nthat by Valladolid being closed.\r\n\r\nIf Moore, allowing his infantry the night of the twenty-first and the\r\nmorning of the twenty-second to recruit their strength, had marched\r\non Carrion on the afternoon of the latter day, he would have caught\r\nSoult at a disadvantage at dawn on the twenty-third, for none of the\r\nsupporting forces had yet got into touch with the Marshal. If the\r\nlatter had dared to make a stand, he would have been crushed: but it is\r\nmore probable that--being a prudent general--he would have fallen back\r\na march in the direction of Burgos. But, as it chanced, Moore resolved\r\nto give his men forty-eight hours instead of thirty-six at Sahagun--and\r\ntwelve hours often suffice to change the whole situation. The army was\r\ntold to rest as long as daylight lasted on the twenty-third, and to\r\nmarch at nightfall, so as to appear in front of the bridge of Carrion\r\nat dawn on the twenty-fourth. Attacked at daybreak, the Marshal would,\r\nas Moore hoped, find no time to organize his retreat and would thus be\r\nforced to fight.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting at Sahagun for the sun to set, Moore received a dispatch\r\nfrom La Romana to say that, in accordance with his promise, he had\r\nmarched from Leon to aid his allies. But he could only put into the\r\nfield some 8,000 men and a single battery--with which he had advanced\r\nto Mansilla, with his vanguard at Villarminio, on the road to Saldaña.\r\nHe was thus but eighteen miles from Sahagun, and though he had only\r\nbrought a third of his army with him, could be utilized in the oncoming\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the only news which reached Moore on the afternoon\r\nof the twenty-third. Only two short hours before he received the\r\ndispatch from Mansilla, another note from La Romana had come in, with\r\ninformation of very much greater importance. A confidential agent of\r\nthe Marquis, beyond the Douro, had sent him a messenger with news that\r\nall the French forces in the direction of the Escurial were turning\r\nnorthward and crossing the Guadarrama. Putting this intelligence side\r\nby side with rumours brought in by peasants, to the effect that great\r\nquantities of food and forage had been ordered to be collected in the\r\nvillages west of Palencia, Moore drew the right inference. What he\r\nhad always expected had come to pass. Napoleon had turned north from\r\nMadrid, and was hastening across the mountains to overwhelm the British\r\narmy[636].\r\n\r\n  [636] From Moore’s dispatch to La Romana, written on the\r\n  twenty-third, we gather that the letter with the news about the\r\n  French movements came in about six p.m., and the second one with\r\n  the report that the Spaniards had reached Mansilla about eight.\r\n  The latter is acknowledged in a postscript to Moore’s reply to\r\n  the former. The resolve to retreat was made between six and eight\r\n  o’clock.\r\n\r\nWithout losing a moment, Moore countermanded his advance on Carrion.\r\nThe orders went out at nine o’clock, when the leading brigades had\r\nalready started. As the men were tramping over the frozen snow, in\r\nfull expectation of a fight at dawn, they were suddenly told to halt.\r\nA moment later came the command to turn back by the road that they had\r\ncome, and to retire to their bivouacs of the previous day. Utterly\r\npuzzled and much disgusted the troops returned to Sahagun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII: CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON’S PURSUIT OF MOORE: SAHAGUN TO ASTORGA\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have many times had occasion in this narrative to wonder at the\r\nextreme tardiness with which news reached the Spanish and the English\r\ngenerals. It is now at the inefficiency of Napoleon’s intelligence\r\ndepartment that we must express our surprise. Considering that Moore\r\nhad moved forward from Salamanca as far back as December 12, and had\r\nmade his existence manifest to the French on that same day by the\r\nsuccessful skirmish at Rueda, it is astonishing to find that the\r\nEmperor did not grasp the situation for nine days. Under the influence\r\nof his pre-conceived idea that the British must be retiring on Lisbon,\r\nhe was looking for them in every other quarter rather than the banks\r\nof the Upper Douro. On the seventeenth he was ordering reconnaissances\r\nto be made in the direction of Plasencia[637] in Estremadura (of all\r\nplaces in the world) to get news of Moore, and was still pushing\r\ntroops towards Talavera on the road to Portugal. The general tendency\r\nof all his movements was in this direction, and there can be no doubt\r\nthat in a few days his great central reserve would have followed in\r\nthe wake of Lasalle and Lefebvre, and started for Badajoz and Elvas.\r\nOn the nineteenth he reviewed outside Madrid the troops that were\r\navailable for instant movement--the Imperial Guard, the corps of Ney,\r\nthe divisions of Leval and Lapisse--about 40,000 men with 150 guns,\r\nall in excellent order, and with fifteen days’ biscuit stored in\r\ntheir wagons[638]. Of the direction they were to take we can have no\r\ndoubt, when we read in the imperial correspondence orders for naval\r\nofficers to be hurried up to reorganize the arsenal of Lisbon[639],\r\nand a private note to Bessières--the commander-in-chief of the\r\ncavalry--bidding him start his spare horses and his personal baggage\r\nfor Talavera[640].\r\n\r\n  [637] _Nap. Corresp._, 14,577 [Dec. 17], orders Lasalle’s cavalry\r\n  to push for Plasencia in order to get news of the British army.\r\n\r\n  [638] Napier (i. 304) says that there were 60,000 men present,\r\n  but it is hard to see how such a number could have been collected\r\n  on that day at Madrid; and the official account of the review in\r\n  the _Madrid Gazette_ for Dec. 23 says that 40,000 men appeared,\r\n  ‘all in beautiful order, and testifying their enthusiasm by their\r\n  shouts as His Majesty rode past the front of each regiment.’\r\n  The Emperor never understated his forces on such occasions: the\r\n  tendency was the other way.\r\n\r\n  [639] _Nap. Corresp._, 14,514, to Admiral Decrès. Cf. De Pradt,\r\n  p. 211.\r\n\r\n  [640] _Nap. Corresp._, 14,553, to Bessières, Dec. 12.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor’s obstinate refusal to look in the right direction is very\r\ncurious when we remember that Moore’s cavalry was sweeping the plains\r\nas far as Valladolid from December 12 to 16, and that on the eighteenth\r\nFranceschi had abandoned that important city, while Soult had got news\r\nof Moore’s being on the move two days earlier. Clearly either there\r\nwas grave neglect in sending information on the part of the French\r\ncavalry generals in Old Castile, or else the Emperor had so convinced\r\nhimself that the British were somewhere on the road to Lisbon, that\r\nhe did not read the true meaning of the dispatches from the north. Be\r\nthis as it may, it is evident that there was a serious failure in the\r\nimperial intelligence department, and that a week or more was wasted.\r\nBonaparte ought to have been astir two or three days after Stewart and\r\nPaget drove in Franceschi’s screen of vedettes. As a matter of fact it\r\nwas nine days before any move was made at the French head quarters: yet\r\nRueda is only ninety-five miles from Madrid.\r\n\r\nThe first definite intelligence as to the English being on the move in\r\nOld Castile reached the Emperor on the evening of December 19. Yet it\r\nwas only on the twenty-first that he really awoke to the full meaning\r\nof the reports that reached him from Soult and Franceschi[641]. But\r\nwhen he did at last realize the situation, he acted with a sudden\r\nand spasmodic energy which was never surpassed in any of his earlier\r\ncampaigns. He hurled on to Moore’s track not only the central reserve\r\nat Madrid, but troops gathered in from all directions, till he had\r\nset at least 80,000 men on the march, to encompass the British corps\r\nwhich had so hardily thrown itself upon his communications. Moore had\r\nbeen perfectly right when he stated his belief that the sight of the\r\nredcoats within reach would stir the Emperor up to such wrath, that\r\nhe would abandon every other enterprise and rush upon them with every\r\navailable man.\r\n\r\n  [641] In _Nap. Corresp._ there is no trace of movement till the\r\n  twenty-second.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the twenty-first the French troops from every\r\ncamp around Madrid were pouring out towards the Escurial and the two\r\npasses over the Guadarrama. The cavalry of Ney’s corps and of the\r\nImperial Guard was in front, then came the masses of their infantry.\r\nLapisse’s division fell in behind: an express was sent to Dessolles,\r\nwho was guarding the road to Calatayud and Saragossa, to leave only\r\ntwo battalions and a battery behind, and to make forced marches on the\r\nEscurial with the rest of his men. Another aide-de-camp rode to set\r\nLahoussaye’s division of dragoons on the move from Avila[642]. Finally\r\nmessengers rode north to bid Lorges’s dragoons, and all the fractions\r\nof Junot’s corps, to place themselves under the orders of Soult.\r\nMillet’s belated division of dragoons was to do the same, if it had yet\r\ncrossed the Ebro.\r\n\r\n  [642] All this can be studied in _Nap. Corresp._, 14,609,\r\n  14,611, 14,614. The march out towards the Escurial is fixed, by\r\n  the _Madrid Gazette_ of Dec. 23, as having begun late on the\r\n  twenty-first.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, once more committing the error of arguing from\r\ninsufficient data, had made up his mind that the English were at\r\nValladolid[643]. He had no news from that place since Franceschi\r\nhad abandoned it, and chose to assume that Moore, or at any rate\r\nsome portion of the British army, was there established. Under this\r\nhypothesis it would be easy to cut off the raiders from a retreat on\r\nPortugal, or even on Galicia, by carrying troops with extreme speed\r\nto Tordesillas and Medina de Rio Seco. This comparatively easy task\r\nwas all that Napoleon aimed at in his first directions. Villacastin,\r\nArevalo, Olmedo, and Medina del Campo are the points to which his\r\norders of December 21 and 22 require that the advancing columns should\r\nbe pushed.\r\n\r\n  [643] This error appears in _Nap. Corresp._, 14,614 [Dec. 22],\r\n  ‘si les Anglais veulent tenir à Valladolid’; 14,616 [Dec. 23]\r\n  says, ‘Les Anglais paraissent être à Valladolid, probablement\r\n  avec une avant-garde.’ It is only on Dec. 27 that he writes to\r\n  King Joseph that they had never been there at all, save with a\r\n  flying party of 100 light cavalry.\r\n\r\nFor the maintenance of Madrid, and the ‘containing’ of the Spanish\r\narmies at Cuenca and Almaraz, the Emperor left nothing behind but the\r\ncorps of Lefebvre, two-thirds of the corps of Victor, and the three\r\ncavalry divisions of Lasalle, Milhaud, and Latour-Maubourg--8,000 horse\r\nand 28,000 foot in all, with ninety guns[644]. King Joseph was left\r\nin nominal command of the whole. Such a force was amply sufficient to\r\nhold back the disorganized troops of Galluzzo and Infantado, but not to\r\nadvance on Seville or on Lisbon. It was impossible that any blow should\r\nbe dealt to the west or the south, till the Emperor should send back\r\nsome of the enormous masses of men that he had hurled upon Moore. Thus\r\nthe English general’s intention was fully carried out: his raid into\r\nOld Castile had completely disarranged all Bonaparte’s plans. It gave\r\nthe Spaniards at least two months in which to rally and recover their\r\nspirits, and it drew the field-army of the Emperor into a remote and\r\ndesolate corner of Spain, so that the main centres of resistance were\r\nleft unmolested.\r\n\r\n  [644] This is Napoleon’s own estimate (_Nap. Corresp._, 14,615).\r\n  Marshal Jourdan, who was more or less in charge of the whole,\r\n  as chief of the staff to King Joseph, says that there were in\r\n  reality only 30,000 men in all (_Mémoires Militaires_, p. 130).\r\n  Not only was Victor’s corps short of the division of Lapisse\r\n  (which the Emperor had carried off), but Lefebvre’s was also\r\n  incomplete, as two Dutch and one German battalions of Leval’s\r\n  division were behind in Biscay, garrisoning Bilbao and other\r\n  points. King Joseph’s Guards had also left some detachments\r\n  behind, and were not up to full strength (_Nap. Corresp._,\r\n  14,615).\r\n\r\nNapoleon had guessed part, but by no means all, of Moore’s design.\r\n‘The manœuvre of the English is very strange,’ he wrote to his brother\r\nJoseph; ‘it is proved that they have evacuated Salamanca. Probably\r\nthey have brought their transports round to Ferrol, because they think\r\nthat the retreat on Lisbon is no longer safe, as we could push on\r\nfrom Talavera by the left bank of the Tagus and shut the mouth of the\r\nriver.... Probably they have evacuated Portugal and transferred their\r\nbase to Ferrol, because it offers advantages for a safe embarkation.\r\nBut while retreating, they might hope to inflict a check on the corps\r\nof Soult, and may not have made up their mind to try it till they\r\nhad got upon their new line of retreat, and moved to the right bank\r\nof the Douro. They may have argued as follows: “If the French commit\r\nthemselves to a march on Lisbon, we can evacuate on Oporto, and while\r\ndoing so are still on our line of communications with Ferrol. Or,\r\npossibly, they may be expecting fresh reinforcements. But whatever\r\ntheir plan may be, their move will have a great influence on the end of\r\nthis whole business.”’\r\n\r\nThe Emperor thought therefore that Moore’s main object had been to\r\nchange an unsafe base at Lisbon for a safe one in Galicia, and that the\r\ndemonstration against Soult was incidental and secondary. It does not\r\nseem to have struck him that the real design was to lure the central\r\nfield-army of the French from Madrid, and to postpone the invasion\r\nof the south. Many of his apologists and admirers have excused his\r\nblindness, by saying that Moore’s plan was so rash and hazardous that\r\nno sensible man could have guessed it. But this is a complete mistake:\r\nthe plan, if properly carried out, was perfectly sound. Sir John knew\r\nprecisely what he was doing, and was prepared to turn on his heel and\r\ngo back at full speed, the instant that he saw the least movement on\r\nthe side of Madrid. It was in no rash spirit that he acted, but rather\r\nthe reverse: ‘I mean to proceed bridle in hand,’ he said; ‘and if the\r\nbubble bursts, we shall have a run for it.’[645] And on this principle\r\nhe acted: three hours after he got notice that Napoleon was on the\r\nmarch, he started to ‘make a run for it’ to Astorga, and his promptness\r\nwas such that his main body was never in the slightest danger from\r\nthe Emperor’s rush on Benavente, fierce and sudden though it was. The\r\ndisasters of the second part of the retreat were not in the least\r\ncaused by Napoleon’s intercepting movement, which proved an absolute\r\nand complete failure.\r\n\r\n  [645] Moore to Baird, from Salamanca, Dec. 6.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed: Ney’s corps, which led the advance against Moore,\r\ncrossed the Guadarrama on the night of December 21, and had arrived\r\nsafely at Villacastin, on the northern side of the passes, on the\r\nmorning of the twenty-second. As if to contradict the Emperor’s\r\nstatement--made as he was setting out--that ‘the weather could not\r\nbe better,’ a dreadful tempest arose that day. When Bonaparte rode\r\nup from Chamartin, to place himself at the head of his Guard, which\r\nwas to cross the mountains on the twenty-second, he found the whole\r\ncolumn stopped by a howling blizzard, which swept down the pass with\r\nirresistible strength and piled the snow in large drifts at every\r\ninconvenient corner of the defile. It is said that several horsemen\r\nwere flung over precipices by the mere force of the wind. The whole\r\ntrain of cannon and caissons stuck halfway up the ascent, and could\r\nneither advance nor retreat. Violently irritated at the long delay,\r\nNapoleon turned on every pioneer that could be found to clear away the\r\ndrifts, set masses of men to trample down the snow into a beaten track,\r\nforced the officers and all the cavalry to dismount and lead their\r\nhorses, and unharnessed half the artillery so as to give double teams\r\nto the rest. In this way the Guard, with the Emperor walking on foot in\r\nits midst, succeeded at last in crawling through to Villacastin by the\r\nnight of December 23. A considerable number of men died of cold and\r\nfatigue, and the passage had occupied some sixteen hours more than had\r\nbeen calculated by the Emperor. The troops which followed him had less\r\ntrouble in their passage, the tempest having abated its fury, and the\r\npath cleared by the Guard being available for their use.\r\n\r\nAt the very moment at which Moore was countermanding the\r\nadvance on Sahagun--about seven o’clock on the evening of the\r\ntwenty-third--Napoleon was throwing himself on his couch at\r\nVillacastin, after a day of fatigue which had tried even his iron\r\nframe. For the next week the two armies were contending with their\r\nfeet and not their arms, in the competition which the French officers\r\ncalled the ‘race to Benavente[646].’ Napoleon was at last beginning to\r\nunderstand that he had not before him the comparatively simple task of\r\ncutting the road between Valladolid and Astorga, but the much harder\r\none of intercepting that between Sahagun and Astorga. For the first\r\nthree days of his march he was still under some hopes of catching the\r\nEnglish before they could cross the Esla--and if any of them had been\r\nat Valladolid this would certainly have been possible. On December 24\r\nhe was at Arevalo: on Christmas Day he reached Tordesillas, where he\r\nwaited twenty-four hours to allow his infantry to come up with his\r\ncavalry. On the twenty-seventh he at last understood--mainly through a\r\nletter from Soult--that the English were much further north than he had\r\nat first believed. But he was still in high spirits: he did not think\r\nit probable that Moore also might have been making forced marches, and\r\nhaving seized Medina de Rio Seco with Ney’s corps, he imagined that he\r\nwas close on the flank of the retreating enemy. ‘To-day or to-morrow,’\r\nhe wrote to his brother Joseph on that morning, ‘it is probable that\r\ngreat events will take place. If the English have not already retreated\r\nthey are lost: even if they have already moved they shall be pursued\r\nto the water’s edge, and not half of them shall re-embark. Put in your\r\nnewspapers that 36,000 English are surrounded, that I am at Benavente\r\nin their rear, while Soult is in their front[647].’ The announcement\r\nwas duly made in the _Madrid Gazette_, but the Emperor had been\r\ndeceived as to the condition of affairs, which never in actual fact\r\nresembled the picture that he had drawn for himself[648].\r\n\r\n  [646] The phrase will be found in De Pradt, p. 211.\r\n\r\n  [647] _Nap. Corresp._, 14,620 (Napoleon to King Joseph, Dec. 27).\r\n\r\n  [648] Oddly enough Joseph had anticipated his brother’s orders,\r\n  by putting in the _Madrid Gazette_ of that very day a notice\r\n  that a British corps was in the most critical position, that its\r\n  retreat was cut off, and that ‘London, so long insensible to the\r\n  woes of Spain, will soon grieve over a disaster that is her own\r\n  and not that of another.’\r\n\r\nSir John had commenced his retreat from Sahagun on the twenty-fourth,\r\nwith the intention of retiring to Astorga, and of taking up a position\r\non the mountains behind it that might cover Galicia. He did not\r\nintend to retire any further unless he were obliged[649]. If Soult\r\nshould follow him closely, while the Emperor was still two or three\r\nmarches away, he announced his intention of turning upon the Marshal\r\nand offering him battle. He wrote to La Romana asking him to hold the\r\nbridge of Mansilla (the most northerly passage over the Esla) as long\r\nas might be prudent, and then to retire on the Asturias, leaving the\r\nroad to Galicia clear for the English army[650].\r\n\r\n  [649] Moore to La Romana, from Sahagun, night of Dec. 23-4.\r\n\r\n  [650] Moore to La Romana, from Sahagun, Dec. 24.\r\n\r\nAt noon on the twenty-fourth Moore started off in two columns: Baird’s\r\ndivision marched by the northern road to Valencia de Don Juan, where\r\nthe Esla is passable by a ford and a ferry: Hope and Fraser took the\r\nmore southern route by Mayorga and the bridge of Castro Gonzalo. The\r\nreserve division under E. Paget, and the two light brigades, remained\r\nbehind at Sahagun for twenty-four hours to cover the retreat. The five\r\ncavalry regiments were ordered to press in closely upon Soult, and to\r\nkeep him as long as possible in doubt as to whether he was not himself\r\nabout to be attacked.\r\n\r\nThis demonstration seems to have served its purpose, for the Marshal\r\nmade no move either on the twenty-fourth or the twenty-fifth. Yet by\r\nthe latter day his army was growing very formidable, as all the corps\r\nfrom Burgos and Palencia were reporting themselves to him: Lorges’s\r\ndragoons had reached Frechilla, and Delaborde with the head of the\r\ninfantry of Junot’s corps was at Paredes, only thirteen miles from\r\nSoult’s head quarters at Carrion. Loison and Heudelet were not far\r\nbehind. Yet the English columns marched for two days wholly unmolested.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-sixth Baird crossed the Esla at Valencia: the ford was\r\ndangerous, for the river was rising: a sudden thaw on the twenty-fourth\r\nhad turned the roads into mud, and loosened the snows. But the guns\r\nand baggage crossed without loss, as did also some of the infantry,\r\nthe rest using the two ferry-boats[651]. Hope and Fraser, on the\r\nMayorga road, had nothing but the badness of their route to contend\r\nagainst. The soil of this part of the kingdom of Leon is a soft rich\r\nloam, and the cross-roads were knee-deep in clay: for the whole of\r\nthe twenty-sixth it rained without intermission: the troops plodded\r\non in very surly mood, but as yet there was no straggling. It was\r\nstill believed that Moore would fight at Astorga, and, though the men\r\ngrumbled that ‘the General intended to march them to death first and to\r\nfight after[652],’ they still kept together.\r\n\r\n  [651] There is a good account of this dangerous passage in Adam\r\n  Neale’s _Spanish Campaign of 1808_.\r\n\r\n  [652] Memoir of ‘T.S.’ of the 71st Highlanders, p. 53.\r\n\r\nBut already signs were beginning to be visible that their discipline\r\nwas about to break down. A good deal of wanton damage and a\r\ncertain amount of plunder took place at the halting-places for the\r\nnight--Mayorga, Valderas, and Benavente. A voice from the ranks\r\nexplains the situation. ‘Our sufferings were so great that many of the\r\nmen lost their natural activity and spirits, and became savage in their\r\ndispositions. The idea of running away, without even firing a shot,\r\nfrom the enemy we had beaten so easily at Vimiero, was too galling to\r\ntheir feelings. Each spoke to his fellow, even in common conversation,\r\nwith bitterness: rage flashed out on the most trifling occasion of\r\ndisagreement. The poor Spaniards had little to expect from such men as\r\nthese, who blamed them for their inactivity. Every man found at home\r\nwas looked upon as a traitor to his country. “Why is not every Spaniard\r\nunder arms and fighting? The cause is not ours: are we to be the only\r\nsufferers?” Such was the common language, and from these feelings\r\npillage and outrage naturally arose[653].’ The men began to seize food\r\nin the towns and villages without waiting for the regular distribution,\r\nforced their way into houses, and (the country being singularly\r\ndestitute of wood) tore down sheds and doors to build up their bivouac\r\nfires. The most deplorable mischief took place at Benavente, where\r\nthe regiment quartered in the picturesque old castle belonging to the\r\nDuchess of Osuna burnt much of the mediaeval furniture, tore down the\r\nsixteenth-century tapestry to make bed-clothes, and lighted fires on\r\nthe floors of the rooms, to the destruction of the porcelain friezes\r\nand alcoves[654]. Moore issued a strongly-worded proclamation against\r\nthese excesses on December 27, blaming the officers for not keeping\r\nan eye upon the men, and pointing out that ‘not bravery alone, but\r\npatience and constancy under fatigue and hardship were military\r\nvirtues[655].’ Unfortunately, such arguments had little effect on the\r\ntired and surly rank and file. Things were ere long to grow much worse.\r\n\r\n  [653] I am again quoting from the admirable narrative of ‘T.S.’,\r\n  the private in the 71st. Compare Ormsby’s _Letters_, ii. 92-3,\r\n  for the wanton plundering.\r\n\r\n  [654] The French did worse, as they burnt the whole castle when\r\n  they occupied it during the first days of the new year. But\r\n  that is no justification for the conduct of the British. For a\r\n  description of the damage done see Ormsby, ii. 102, 103.\r\n\r\n  [655] General Order, issued at Benavente on Dec. 27.\r\n\r\nThe infantry, as we have seen, accomplished their march to Benavente\r\nwithout molestation, and all, including the rearguard, were across the\r\nEsla by the twenty-seventh. Paget’s cavalry, however, had a much more\r\nexciting time on the last two days. Finding that he was not attacked,\r\nSoult began to bestir himself on the twenty-sixth: he sent Lorges’s\r\ndragoons after the British army, in the direction of Mayorga, while\r\nwith Franceschi’s cavalry and the whole of his infantry he marched by\r\nthe direct road on Astorga, via the bridge of Mansilla.\r\n\r\nLorges’s four regiments were in touch with the rearguard of Paget’s\r\nhussars on the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh, but they were not the\r\nonly or the most important enemies who were now striving to drive in\r\nMoore’s cavalry screen. The advanced guard of the Emperor’s army had\r\njust come up, and first Colbert’s brigade of Ney’s corps and then\r\nthe cavalry of the Guard began to press in upon Paget: Lahoussaye’s\r\ndragoons arrived on the scene a little later. It is a splendid\r\ntestimonial to the way in which the British horsemen were handled, that\r\nthey held their own for three days against nearly triple forces on a\r\nfront of thirty miles[656]. No better certificate could be given to\r\nthem than the fact that the Emperor estimated them, when the fighting\r\nwas over, at 4,000 or 5,000 sabres, their real force being only 2,400.\r\nHe wrote, too, in a moment of chagrin when Moore’s army had just\r\nescaped from him, so that he was not at all inclined to exaggerate\r\ntheir numbers, and as a matter of fact rated the infantry too low.\r\n\r\nBut under the admirable leading of Paget the British cavalry held its\r\nown in every direction. Moore was not exaggerating when he wrote on the\r\ntwenty-eighth that ‘they have obtained by their spirit and enterprise\r\nan ascendency over the French which nothing but great superiority of\r\nnumbers on their part can get the better of[657].’ The 18th Light\r\nDragoons turned back to clear their rear six times on December 27, and\r\non each occasion drove in the leading squadrons of their pursuers with\r\nsuch effect that they secured themselves an unmolested retreat for the\r\nnext few miles. At one charge, near Valencia de Don Juan, a troop of\r\nthirty-eight sabres of this regiment charged a French squadron of 105\r\nmen, and broke through them, killing twelve and capturing twenty. The\r\n10th Hussars, while fending off Lorges’s dragoons near Mayorga, found\r\nthat a regiment of the light cavalry of Ney had got into their rear and\r\nhad drawn itself up on a rising ground flanking the high-road. Charging\r\nup the slope, and over soil deep in the slush of half-melted snow,\r\nthey broke through the enemy’s line, and got off in safety with 100\r\nprisoners. Every one of Paget’s five regiments had its full share of\r\nfighting on the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh, yet they closed in on\r\nto Benavente in perfect order, with insignificant losses, and exulting\r\nin a complete consciousness of their superiority to the enemy’s horse.\r\nSince the start from Salamanca they had in twelve days taken no less\r\nthan 500 prisoners, besides inflicting considerable losses in killed\r\nand wounded on the French. They had still one more success before them,\r\nere they found themselves condemned to comparative uselessness among\r\nthe mountains of Galicia.\r\n\r\n  [656] Five regiments (7th, 10th, and 15th Hussars, 18th Light\r\n  Dragoons, 3rd K. G. L.) were being pressed by thirteen French\r\n  regiments--four each of Lorges’s and Lahoussaye’s, two of\r\n  Colbert’s, and three of the Guard.\r\n\r\n  [657] Moore to Castlereagh, from Benavente, Dec. 28.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-eighth Robert Crawfurd’s brigade had waited behind in\r\nthe mud and rain, drawn up in front of the bridge of Castro Gonzalo,\r\n‘standing for many hours with arms posted, and staring the French\r\ncavalry in the face, while the water actually ran out of the muzzles\r\nof their muskets[658].’ At last our hussars retired, and Crawfurd blew\r\nup two arches of the bridge when Paget had passed over, and moved back\r\non Benavente, after some trifling skirmishing with the cavalry of the\r\nImperial Guard, who had come up in force and tried to interrupt his\r\nwork. The indefatigable British horsemen left pickets all along the\r\nriver on each side of the broken bridge, ready to report and oppose any\r\nattempt to cross.\r\n\r\n  [658] _Recollections of Rifleman Harris_, p. 171.\r\n\r\nAfter resting for a day in Benavente Moore had sent on the divisions\r\nof Fraser and Hope to Astorga, by the highway through La Baneza. The\r\ndivision of Baird, marching from Valencia by villainous cross-roads,\r\nconverged on the same point, where the three corps met upon December\r\n29. Their march was wholly unmolested by the French, who were being\r\nsuccessfully held back by Moore’s rearguard under the two Pagets--the\r\ncavalry general and the commander of the reserve division--and by\r\nCrawfurd and Alten’s light brigades. On the same morning that the main\r\nbody reached Astorga, the infantry of the rearguard marched out of\r\nBenavente, leaving behind only the horsemen, who were watching all the\r\nfords, with their supports three miles behind in the town of Benavente.\r\nSeeing that all the infantry had disappeared, Lefebvre-Desnouettes,\r\nwho commanded the cavalry of the Guard, thought it high time to press\r\nbeyond the Esla: it was absurd, he thought, that the mass of French\r\nhorsemen, now gathered opposite the broken bridge of Castro Gonzalo,\r\nshould allow themselves to be kept in check by a mere chain of vedettes\r\nunsupported by infantry or guns. Accordingly he searched for fords,\r\nand when one was found a few hundred yards from the bridge, crossed\r\nit at the head of the four squadrons of the chasseurs of the Guard,\r\nbetween 500 and 600 sabres[659]. The rest of his troops, after vainly\r\nseeking for other passages, were about to follow him. The moment that\r\nhe had got over the water Lefebvre found himself withstood by the\r\npickets, mainly belonging to the 18th Light Dragoons, who came riding\r\nin from their posts along the river to mass themselves opposite to\r\nhim. When about 130 men were collected, under Colonel Otway, they\r\nventured to charge the leading squadrons of the chasseurs, of course\r\nwith indifferent success. After retiring a few hundred yards more,\r\nthey were joined by a troop of the 3rd Dragoons of the King’s German\r\nLegion, under Major Burgwedel, and again turned to fight. At this\r\nsecond clash the front line of the pursuers was broken for a moment,\r\nand the dragoons who had burst through the gap had a narrow escape of\r\nbeing surrounded and captured by the second line, but finally fought\r\ntheir way out of the _mêlée_ with no great loss. Charles Stewart, their\r\nbrigadier, now came up and rallied them for the second time: he retired\r\ntowards the town in good order, without allowing himself to be cowed\r\nby Lefebvre’s rapid advance, for he knew that supports were at hand.\r\nLord Paget, warned in good time, had drawn out the 10th Hussars under\r\ncover of the houses of the southern suburb of Benavente. He waited till\r\nthe chasseurs drew quite near to him, and were too remote from the\r\nford they had crossed to be able to retire with ease: then he suddenly\r\nsallied out from his cover and swooped down upon them. The pickets at\r\nthe same moment wheeled about, cheered, and charged. The enemy, now\r\nslightly outnumbered--for the 10th were fully 450 sabres strong, and\r\nthe pickets at least 200--made a good fight. A British witness observes\r\nthat these ‘fine big fellows in fur caps and long green coats’ were\r\nfar better than the line regiments with which the hussars had hitherto\r\nbeen engaged. But in a few minutes they were broken, and chased for\r\ntwo miles right back to the ford by which they had crossed. Lefebvre\r\nhimself was captured by a private of the 10th named Grisdale, his\r\nwounded horse having refused to swim the river[660]. With him there\r\nwere taken two captains and seventy unwounded prisoners. The chasseurs\r\nleft fifty-five men dead or hurt upon the field, and many of those who\r\ngot away were much cut about[661]. The British casualties were fifty,\r\nalmost all from the men who had furnished the pickets, for the 10th\r\nsuffered little: Burgwedel, who had led the Germans of the 3rd K. G.\r\nL., was the only officer hurt[662].\r\n\r\n  [659] Napoleon (_Nap. Corresp._, 14,623) says that the regiment\r\n  of chasseurs was only 300 strong, and their loss only sixty. But\r\n  the splendid regiments of the Guard cavalry had not yet fallen to\r\n  this small number of sabres.\r\n\r\n  [660] He was sent to England, and long lived on parole at\r\n  Cheltenham. While he was there Charles Vaughan called on him, and\r\n  got from him some valuable information about the first siege of\r\n  Saragossa, whose history he was then writing. In 1811 Lefebvre\r\n  broke his parole and escaped to France, where Napoleon welcomed\r\n  him and restored him to command.\r\n\r\n  [661] Larrey, the Emperor’s surgeon, commenting on sabre-wounds,\r\n  says that no less than seventy wounded of the chasseurs came\r\n  under his care on this occasion.\r\n\r\n  [662] In James Moore’s book this gallant officer appears under\r\n  the English disguise of Major Bagwell, under which I did not at\r\n  first recognize him (p. 181). Oddly enough Adam Neale makes the\r\n  same mistake (p. 179).\r\n\r\nThe remnant of the chasseurs crossed the river, and were immediately\r\nsupported by other regiments, who (after failing to find another ford)\r\nhad come down to that which Lefebvre had used. They showed some\r\nsigns of attempting a second passage, but Lord Paget turned upon them\r\nthe guns of Downman’s horse-battery, which had just galloped up from\r\nBenavente. After two rounds the enemy rode off hastily from the river,\r\nand fell back inland. They had received such a sharp lesson that they\r\nallowed the British cavalry to retreat without molestation in the\r\nafternoon. Napoleon consoled himself with writing that the British were\r\n‘flying in panic’--a statement which the circumstances hardly seemed to\r\njustify[663]--and gave an exaggerated account of the disorders which\r\nthey had committed at Valderas and Benavente, to which he added an\r\nimaginary outrage at Leon[664]. But there is no more talk of Moore’s\r\ncorps being surrounded--wherefore it suddenly shrinks in the Emperor’s\r\nestimation, being no longer 36,000 strong, but only ‘21,000 infantry,\r\nwith 4,000 or 5,000 horse.’ Lefebvre’s affair he frankly owned, when\r\nwriting to King Joseph, was disgusting: ‘by evening I had 8,000 horse\r\non the spot, but the enemy was gone[665].’\r\n\r\n  [663] _Nap. Corresp._, 14,623 (Napoleon to Josephine, from\r\n  Benavente, Dec. 31), ‘Les Anglais fuient épouvantés.’\r\n\r\n  [664] _Nap. Corresp._, 14,626 (Napoleon to King Joseph). Joseph\r\n  is to insert in the Madrid papers letters written from these\r\n  three places with descriptions of the brigandage practised by the\r\n  English--‘à Leon ils ont chassé les moines.’ No English troops\r\n  had ever been within thirty miles of Leon!\r\n\r\n  [665] ‘Cette affaire m’a coûté une soixantaine de mes chasseurs.\r\n  Vous sentez combien cela m’a été désagréable’ (ibid.).\r\n\r\nPaget indeed was so effectively gone, that though French cavalry by\r\nthe thousand crossed the ford that night they could do nothing. And\r\nCrawfurd had so thoroughly destroyed the bridge of Castro Gonzalo--he\r\nhad blown up the central pier, and not merely cut the crowns of the\r\narches--that infantry and guns could not cross till the thirtieth. It\r\nwas only on that day that the heads of Ney’s corps and of the Imperial\r\nGuard came up: Lapisse’s division was still far behind, at Toro. All\r\nthat the rapid forced marches of the Emperor had brought him was the\r\nprivilege of assisting at Paget’s departure, and of picking up in\r\nBenavente some abandoned carts, which Moore had caused to be broken\r\nafter burning their contents.\r\n\r\nNapoleon still consoled himself with the idea that it was possible that\r\nSoult might have been more fortunate than himself, and might perhaps\r\nalready be attacking the English at Astorga. This was not the case:\r\nafter learning that Moore had disappeared from his front, the Duke of\r\nDalmatia had taken the road Sahagun-Mansilla, as the shortest line\r\nwhich would bring him to Astorga, the place where any army intending\r\nto defend Galicia would make its first stand. This choice brought him\r\nupon the tracks of La Romana’s army, not of the British. The Marquis,\r\nwhen Moore retired, had moved back on Leon, but had sent to his ally a\r\nmessage to the effect that he could not accept the suggestion to make\r\nthe Asturias his base, and would be forced, when the enemy advanced, to\r\njoin the British at Astorga. It was absolutely impossible, he said, to\r\nrepair to the Asturias, for the pass of Pajares, the only coach-road\r\nthither, was impassable on account of the snow[666]. La Romana left as\r\na rearguard at the all-important bridge of Mansilla, his 2nd Division,\r\n3,000 strong, with two guns. Contrary to Moore’s advice he would not\r\nblow up the bridge, giving as his reason that the Esla was fordable\r\nin several places in its immediate neighbourhood. This was a blunder;\r\nbut the officer in command of the 2nd Division committed a greater\r\none, by drawing up his main body in front of the bridge and not behind\r\nit--a repetition of Cuesta’s old error at Cabezon. Soult did not come\r\nin contact with the Spanish rearguard till four days after he had left\r\nCarrion: so heavy had been the rain, and so vile the road, that it took\r\nhim from the twenty-sixth to the twenty-ninth to cover the forty-five\r\nmiles between Carrion and Mansilla. But on the morning of December 30\r\nhe delivered his attack: a tremendous cavalry-charge by the chasseurs\r\nand dragoons of Franceschi broke the Spanish line, and pursuers\r\nand pursued went pell-mell over the bridge, which was not defended\r\nfor a moment. The French captured 1,500 men--who were cut off from\r\nre-crossing the river--two guns, and two standards. Hearing of this\r\ndisaster La Romana at once evacuated Leon, which Soult seized on the\r\nthirty-first. The place had been hastily fortified, and there had been\r\nmuch talk of the possibility of defending it[667]; but at the first\r\nsummons it opened its gates without firing a shot. The Marquis--leaving\r\n2,000 sick in the hospitals, and a considerable accumulation of food in\r\nhis magazines--fell back on Astorga, much to the discontent of Moore,\r\nwho had not desired to see him in that direction. Soult at Leon was\r\nonly twenty-five miles from Astorga: he was now but one march from\r\nMoore’s rearguard, and in close touch with the Emperor, who coming up\r\nfrom the south reached La Baneza on the same day--the last of the old\r\nyear, 1808.\r\n\r\n  [666] Symes to Moore, from La Romana’s camp at Mansilla, Dec. 25.\r\n\r\n  [667] Ibid.\r\n\r\nThe divisions of Baird, Hope, and Fraser, as we have already seen,\r\nhad reached Astorga on the twenty-ninth, the reserve division and the\r\nlight brigades (after a most fatiguing march from Benavente) on the\r\nthirtieth, while the cavalry was, as always, to the rear, keeping\r\nback the advancing squadrons of Bessières. Thus on the thirtieth the\r\nEnglish and Spanish armies were concentrated at Astorga with every\r\navailable man present--the British still 25,000 strong; for they had\r\nsuffered little in the fighting, and had not yet begun to straggle--but\r\nRomana with no more than 9,000 or 10,000 of the nominal 22,000 which\r\nhad been shown in his returns of ten days before. His 2nd Division\r\nhad been practically destroyed at Mansilla: he had left 2,000 sick at\r\nLeon, and many more had fallen out of the ranks in the march from that\r\nplace--some because they wished to desert their colours, but more from\r\ncold, disease, and misery; for the army was not merely half naked,\r\nbut infected with a malignant typhus fever which was making terrible\r\nravages in its ranks[668].\r\n\r\n  [668] All witnesses agree that the army of Galicia was in a most\r\n  distressing condition. ‘This army was literally half naked and\r\n  half starved,’ says Adam Neale. ‘A malignant fever was raging\r\n  among them, and long fatigues, privation, and this mortal\r\n  distemper made them appear like spectres issuing from a hospital\r\n  rather than an army’ (p. 181). ‘T.S.’ describes them as ‘looking\r\n  more like a large body of peasants driven from their homes, and\r\n  in want of everything, than a regular army ’ (p. 56). The men fit\r\n  for service are described as being no more than 5,000 strong.\r\n\r\nMoore had told La Romana on the twenty-fourth that he hoped to make\r\na stand at Astorga. The same statement had been passed round the\r\narmy, and had kept up the spirits of the men to some extent, though\r\nmany had begun to believe that ‘Moore would never fight[669].’ There\r\nwere magazines of food at Astorga, and much more considerable ones of\r\nmilitary equipment: a large convoy of shoes, blankets, and muskets\r\nhad lately come in from Corunna, and Baird’s heavy baggage had been\r\nstacked in the place before he marched for Sahagun. The town itself was\r\nsurrounded with ancient walls, and had some possibilities of defence:\r\njust behind it rises the first range of the Galician mountains, a steep\r\nand forbidding chain pierced only by the two passes which contain\r\nthe old and the new high-roads to Corunna. The former--the shorter,\r\nbut by far the more rugged--is called the defile of Foncebadon; the\r\nlatter--longer and easier--is the defile of Manzanal.\r\n\r\n  [669] ‘We all wished it, but none believed it,’ writes ‘T.S.’\r\n  ‘We had been told the same at Benavente, but our movement had\r\n  no appearance of a retreat in which we were to face about and\r\n  make a stand: it was more like a shameful flight’ (p. 56). This\r\n  undoubtedly was the prevailing view in the ranks.\r\n\r\nThe question was at once raised as to whether the position in rear\r\nof Astorga should not be seriously defended. The town itself would\r\nnaturally have to be given up, if the French chose to press on in\r\nforce; but the two defiles might be fortified and held against very\r\nsuperior numbers. To turn 25,000 British troops out of them would have\r\nbeen a very serious task, and the Spaniards meanwhile could have been\r\nused for diversions on the enemy’s flank and rear. La Romana called\r\nupon Moore, at the moment of the latter’s arrival at Astorga, and\r\nproposed that they should join in defending the passes. To give them\r\nup meant, he said, to give up also the great upland valley behind\r\nthem--the Vierzo--where lay his own dépôts and his park of artillery at\r\nPonferrada, and where Moore also had considerable stores and magazines\r\nat Villafranca. The proposal was well worthy of being taken into\r\naccount, and was far from being--as Napier calls it--‘wilder than the\r\ndreams of Don Quixote!’ for the positions were very strong, and there\r\nwas no convenient route by which they could be turned. The only other\r\nway into Galicia, that by Puebla de Sanabria, is not only far away, but\r\nalmost impassable at midwinter from the badness of the road and the\r\ndeep snow. Moreover it leads not into the main valley of the Minho, but\r\ninto that of the Tamega on the Portuguese frontier, from which another\r\nseries of difficult defiles have to be crossed in order to get into the\r\nheart of Galicia. La Romana thought that this road might practically be\r\ndisregarded as an element of danger in a January campaign.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion of the Marquis deserved serious consideration. Moore’s\r\nreasons for a summary rejection of the proposal are not stated by him\r\nat any length[670]. He wrote to Castlereagh merely that there was only\r\ntwo days’ bread at Astorga, that his means of carriage were melting\r\naway by the death of draught beasts and the desertion of drivers, and\r\nthat he feared that the enemy might use the road upon his flank--i.e.\r\nthe Puebla de Sanabria route--to turn his position. He purposed\r\ntherefore to fall back at once to the coast as fast as he could, and\r\ntrusted that the French, for want of food, would not be able to follow\r\nhim further than Villafranca. To these reasons may be added another,\r\nwhich Moore cited in his conversation with La Romana, that the troops\r\nrequired rest, and could not get it in the bleak positions above\r\nAstorga[671].\r\n\r\n  [670] Moore to Castlereagh, from Astorga, Dec. 31, 1808.\r\n\r\n  [671] This plea is not to be found in any of Moore’s dispatches,\r\n  but only in La Romana’s account of the interview which he sent to\r\n  the Junta.\r\n\r\nSome of these reasons are not quite convincing: though there were only\r\ntwo days’ rations at Astorga, there were fourteen days’ at Villafranca,\r\nand large dépôts had also been gathered at Lugo and Corunna. These\r\ncould be rendered available with no great trouble, if real energy were\r\ndisplayed, for there was still (as the disasters of the retreat were to\r\nshow) a good deal of wheeled transport with the army. The flanking road\r\nby Puebla de Sanabria was (as we have said) so difficult and so remote\r\nthat any turning corps that tried it would be heard of long before it\r\nbecame dangerous. There would be great political advantage in checking\r\nBonaparte at the passes, even if it were only for a week or ten days.\r\nMoreover, to show a bold front would raise the spirits of the army,\r\nwhose growing disorders were the marks of discontent at the retreat,\r\nand whose one wish was to fight the French as soon as possible. As to\r\nthe rest which Moore declared to be necessary for the troops, this\r\ncould surely have been better given by halting them and offering to\r\ndefend the passes, than by taking them over the long and desolate road\r\nthat separated them from Corunna. The experiences of the next eleven\r\ndays can hardly be called ‘rest.’\r\n\r\nThough clearly possible, a stand behind Astorga may not have been the\r\nbest policy. Napoleon had a vast force in hand after his junction with\r\nSoult, and he was a dangerous foe to brave, even in such a formidable\r\nposition as that which the British occupied. But it is doubtful whether\r\nthis fact was the cause of Moore’s determination to retreat to the\r\nsea. If we may judge from the tone of his dispatches, his thought was\r\nmerely that he had promised to make a diversion, under strong pressure\r\nfrom Frere and the rest; that he had successfully carried out his\r\nengagement, and lured the Emperor and the bulk of the French forces\r\naway from Madrid; and that he considered his task completed. In his\r\nletter of December 31 to Castlereagh, he harks back once more to his\r\nold depreciation of the Spaniards--they had taken no advantage of the\r\nchance he had given them, they were as apathetic as ever, his exertions\r\nhad been wasted, and so forth[672]. In so writing he made a mistake:\r\nhis campaign was so far from being wasted that he had actually saved\r\nSpain. He had caused the Emperor to lose the psychological moment\r\nfor striking at Seville and Lisbon, when the spirits of the patriots\r\nwere at their lowest, and had given them three months to rally. By\r\nthe time that the southward move from Madrid was once more possible\r\nto the French, Spain had again got armies in the field, and the awful\r\ndisasters of November and December, 1808, had been half forgotten.\r\n\r\n  [672] ‘Abandoned from the beginning by everything Spanish, we\r\n  were equal to nothing by ourselves. From a desire to do what I\r\n  could, I made the movement against Soult. As a diversion it has\r\n  answered completely: but as there is nothing to take advantage of\r\n  it, I have risked the loss of an army to no purpose. I find no\r\n  option now but to fall down to the coast as fast as I am able....\r\n  The army would, there cannot be a doubt, have distinguished\r\n  itself, had the Spaniards been able to offer any resistance. But\r\n  from the first it was placed in situations in which, without the\r\n  possibility of doing any good, it was itself constantly risked’\r\n  (Moore to Castlereagh, from Astorga, Dec. 31).\r\n\r\nIt seems improbable, from Moore’s tone in his dispatch of December 31,\r\nthat he ever had any serious intention of standing behind Astorga.\r\nHe had fallen back upon his old desponding views of the last days\r\nof November, and was simply set on bringing off the British army in\r\nsafety, without much care for the fate of the Spaniards whom he so\r\nmuch disliked and contemned. The only sign of his ever having studied\r\nthe intermediate positions between Astorga and Corunna lies in a\r\nreport addressed to him on December 26, by Carmichael Smith of the\r\nRoyal Engineers. This speaks of the Manzanal--Rodrigatos position as\r\npresenting an appearance of strong ground, but having the defect of\r\npossessing a down-slope to the rear for six miles, so that if the line\r\nwere forced, a long retreat downhill would be necessary in face of the\r\npursuing enemy. The engineer then proceeded to recommend the position\r\nof Cacabellos, a league in front of Villafranca, as being very strong\r\nand safe from any turning movement. But Moore, as we shall see, refused\r\nto stand at the one place as much as at the other, only halting a\r\nrearguard at Cacabellos to keep off the pursuing horse for a few hours,\r\nand never offering a pitched battle upon that ground. It is probable\r\nthat nothing would have induced him to fight at either position, after\r\nhe had once resolved that a straight march to the sea was the best\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nSo little time did Moore take in making up his mind as to the\r\ndesirability of holding the passes above Astorga, that he pushed on\r\nBaird’s, Fraser’s, and Hope’s divisions towards Villafranca on the\r\nthirtieth, while Paget’s reserve with the two light brigades followed\r\non the thirty-first. The whole British army was on the other side of\r\nAstorga, and across the passes, when Soult and Bonaparte’s columns\r\nconverged on La Baneza. Their infantry did not enter Astorga till the\r\nfirst day of the new year, thirty-six hours after Moore’s main body had\r\nevacuated the place.\r\n\r\nBut this easy escape from the Emperor’s clutches had been bought\r\nat considerable sacrifices. Astorga was crammed with stores of all\r\nkinds, as we have already had occasion to mention: food was the only\r\nthing that was at all short. But there was not sufficient transport\r\nin the place, and the retreating army was already losing wagons and\r\nbeasts so fast that it could not carry off much of the accumulated\r\nmaterial that lay before it. A hasty attempt was made to serve out to\r\nthe troops the things that could be immediately utilized. La Romana’s\r\nSpaniards received several thousand new English muskets to replace\r\ntheir dilapidated weapons, and a quantity of blankets. Some of the\r\nBritish regiments had shoes issued to them; but out of mere hurry and\r\nmismanagement several thousand pairs more were destroyed instead of\r\ndistributed, though many men were already almost barefoot. There were\r\nabandoned all the heavy baggage of Baird’s division (which had been\r\nstacked at Astorga before the march to Sahagun), an entire dépôt of\r\nentrenching tools, several hundred barrels of rum, and many scores of\r\ncarts and wagons for which draught animals were wanting. A quantity\r\nof small-arms ammunition was blown up. But the most distressing thing\r\nof all was that those of the sick of the army who could not bear to\r\nbe taken on through the January cold in open wagons had to be left\r\nbehind: some four hundred invalids, it would seem, were abandoned in\r\nthe hospital and fell into the hands of the French[673].\r\n\r\n  [673] Compare Moore to Castlereagh (from Astorga, Dec. 31) with\r\n  _Nap. Corresp._, 14,637, and with James Moore’s memoir (p. 184),\r\n  and ‘T.S.’s autobiography (p. 57).\r\n\r\nThe most deplorable thing about these losses was that all the\r\nevacuation and destruction was carried out under difficulties, owing to\r\nthe gross state of disorder and indiscipline into which the army was\r\nfalling. The news that they were to retreat once more without fighting\r\nhad exasperated the men to the last degree. Thousands of them got loose\r\nin the streets, breaking into houses, maltreating the inhabitants, and\r\npillaging the stores, which were to be abandoned, for their private\r\nprofit. The rum was naturally a great attraction, and many stragglers\r\nwere left behind dead drunk, to be beaten out of the place by the\r\ncavalry when they left it on the night of the thirty-first. La Romana\r\nhad to make formal complaint to Moore of the misbehaviour of the\r\ntroops, who had even tried to steal his artillery mules and insulted\r\nhis officers. There can be no doubt that if the rank and file had been\r\nkept in hand many valuable stores could have been distributed instead\r\nof destroyed, and the straggling which was to prove so fatal might\r\nhave been nipped in the bud. But the officers were as discontented as\r\nthe men, and in many regiments seem to have made little or no effort\r\nto keep things together. Already several battalions were beginning to\r\nmarch with an advanced guard of marauders and a rearguard of limping\r\nstragglers, the sure signs of impending trouble.\r\n\r\nBy the thirty-first, however, Astorga was clear of British and Spanish\r\ntroops. Moore marched by the new high-road, the route of Manzanal: La\r\nRomana took the shorter but more rugged defile of Foncebadon. But he\r\nsent his guns along with the British, in order to spare the beasts\r\nthe steeper ascents of the old _chaussée_. The terrible rain of the\r\nlast week was just passing into snow as the two columns, every man\r\ndesperately out of heart, began their long uphill climb across the\r\nridge of the Monte Teleno, towards the uplands of the Vierzo.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\nThis account of the retreat from Sahagun is constructed from a\r\ncareful comparison of the official documents with the memoirs\r\nand monographs of the following British eye-witnesses:--Robert\r\nBlakeney (of the 28th), Rifleman Harris and Sergeant Surtees\r\n(of the 2/95th), Lord Londonderry, and Lord Vivian of the\r\nCavalry Brigade, Leith Hay (Aide-de-Camp to General Leith),\r\nCharles and William Napier, T.S. of the 71st, Steevens of\r\nthe 20th, the Surgeon Adam Neale, and the Chaplain Ormsby.\r\nBradford, another chaplain, has left a series of admirable\r\nwater-colour drawings of the chief points on the road as far as\r\nLugo, made under such difficulties as can be well imagined. Of\r\nFrench eye-witnesses I have used the accounts of St. Chamans,\r\nFantin des Odoards, Naylies, De Gonneville, Lejeune, and the\r\ndetestably inaccurate Le Noble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII: CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nSOULT’S PURSUIT OF MOORE: ASTORGA TO CORUNNA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he found that Moore had escaped from him, Napoleon slackened down\r\nfrom the high speed with which he had been moving for the last ten\r\ndays. He stayed at Benavente for two nights, occupying himself with\r\ndesk-work of all kinds, and abandoning the pursuit of the British to\r\nBessières and Soult. The great _coup_ had failed: instead of capturing\r\nthe expeditionary force he could but harass it on its way to the sea.\r\nSuch a task was beneath his own dignity: it would compromise the\r\nimperial reputation for infallibility, if a campaign that had opened\r\nwith blows like Espinosa, Tudela, and the capture of Madrid ended in a\r\nlong and ineffectual stern-chase. If Bonaparte had continued the hunt\r\nhimself, with the mere result of arriving in time to see Moore embark\r\nand depart, he would have felt that his prestige had been lowered. He\r\ntacitly confessed as much himself long years after, when, in one of his\r\nlucubrations at St. Helena, he remarked that he would have conducted\r\nthe pursuit in person, if he had but known that contrary winds had\r\nprevented the fleet of British transports from reaching Corunna. But\r\nof this he was unaware at the time; and since he calculated that Moore\r\ncould be harassed perhaps, but not destroyed or captured, he resolved\r\nto halt and turn back. Soult should have the duty of escorting the\r\nBritish to the sea: they were to be pressed vigorously and, with luck,\r\nthe Emperor trusted that half of them might never see England again.\r\nBut no complete success could be expected, and he did not wish to\r\nappear personally in any enterprise that was but partially successful.\r\n\r\nOther reasons were assigned both by Napoleon himself and by his\r\nadmirers for his abandonment of the pursuit of Moore. He stated that\r\nGalicia was too much in a corner of the world for him to adventure\r\nhimself in its mountains--he would be twenty days journey from Paris\r\nand the heart of affairs. If Austria began to move again in the spring,\r\nthere would be an intolerable delay before he could receive news or\r\ntransmit orders[674]. He wished to take in hand the reorganization of\r\nhis armies in Italy, on the Rhine, and beyond the Adriatic. All this\r\nwas plausible enough, but the real reason of his return was that he\r\nwould not be present at a fiasco or a half-success. It would seem,\r\nhowever, that there may have been another operating cause, which the\r\nEmperor never chose to mention; the evidence for it has only cropped\r\nup of late years[675]. It appears that he was somewhat disquieted by\r\nsecret intelligence from Paris, as to obscure intrigues among his\r\nown ministers and courtiers. The Spanish War had given new occasions\r\nto the malcontents who were always criticizing the Empire. Not much\r\ncould be learnt by the French public about the affair of Bayonne, but\r\nall that had got abroad was well calculated to disgust even loyal\r\nsupporters of the Empire. The talk of the _salons_, which Napoleon\r\nalways affected to despise, but which he never disregarded, was more\r\nbitter than ever. It is quite possible that some hint of the conspiracy\r\nof the ‘Philadelphes,’ which four months later showed its hand in the\r\nmysterious affair of D’Argenteau, may have reached him. But it is\r\ncertain that he had disquieting reports concerning the intrigues of\r\nFouché and Talleyrand. Both of those veteran plotters were at this\r\nmoment in more or less marked disgrace. For once in a way, therefore,\r\nthey were acting in concert. They were relieving their injured feelings\r\nby making secret overtures in all directions, in search of allies\r\nagainst their master. Incredible as it may appear, they had found a\r\nready hearer in Murat, who was much disgusted with his brother-in-law\r\nfor throwing upon him the blame for the disasters of the first Spanish\r\ncampaign. Other notable personages were being drawn into the cave\r\nof malcontents, and discourses of more than doubtful loyalty were\r\nbeing delivered. Like many other cabals of the period, this one was\r\ndestined to shrink into nothingness at the reappearance of the master\r\nat Paris[676]. But while he was away his agents were troubled and\r\nterrified: they seem to have sent him alarming hints, which had far\r\nmore to do with his return to France than any fear as to the intentions\r\nof Austria[677].\r\n\r\n  [674] These reasons will be found set forth at length in _Nap.\r\n  Corresp._, 14,684 (to King Joseph, Jan. 11), and 14,692 (to\r\n  Clarke, Jan. 13).\r\n\r\n  [675] There is a distinct allusion to the matter, however, in\r\n  Fouché’s _Mémoires_ (i. 385).\r\n\r\n  [676] For a long account of all this intrigue see the _Mémoires_\r\n  of Chancellor Pasquier (i. 355, &c.). He says that it was\r\n  discovered by Lavalette, the Postmaster-General, who sent\r\n  information to the Viceroy of Italy, in consequence of which\r\n  a compromising letter from Caroline Bonaparte (at Naples)\r\n  to Talleyrand was seized. The reproaches which he puts into\r\n  Napoleon’s mouth must, I fancy, be taken as about as authentic as\r\n  an oration in Thucydides.\r\n\r\n  [677] There was also at this moment a slight recrudescence of the\r\n  old agitation of the _chouans_ in the west of France. Movable\r\n  columns had to be sent out in the departments of the Mayenne and\r\n  Sarthe. See _Nap. Corresp._, 14,871-2.\r\n\r\nAn oft-repeated story says that the Emperor received a packet of\r\nletters from Paris while riding from Benavente to Astorga on January\r\n1, 1809, and, after reading them by the wayside with every sign of\r\nanger, declared that he must return to France. If the tale be true, we\r\nmay be sure that the papers which so moved his wrath had no reference\r\nto armaments on the Danube, but were concerned with the intrigues in\r\nParis. There was absolutely nothing in the state of European affairs\r\nto make an instant departure from Spain necessary. On the other hand,\r\nrumours of domestic plots always touched the Emperor to the quick, and\r\nit must have been as irritating as it was unexpected to discover that\r\nhis own sister and brother-in-law were dabbling in such intrigues,\r\neven though ostensibly they were but discussing what should be done if\r\nsomething should happen in Spain to their august relative.\r\n\r\nAlready ere leaving Benavente the Emperor had issued orders which\r\nshowed that he had abandoned his hope of surrounding and crushing\r\nMoore. He had begun to send off, to the right and to the left, part of\r\nthe great mass of troops which he had brought with him. On December\r\n31 he wrote to Dessolles, and ordered him to give his division a\r\nshort rest at Villacastin, and then to return to Madrid, where the\r\ngarrison was too weak. On January 1, the whole of the Imperial Guard\r\nwas directed to halt and return to Benavente, from whence it was soon\r\nafter told to march back to Valladolid. Lapisse’s division of Victor’s\r\ncorps, which had got no further than Benavente in its advance, was\r\nturned off to subdue the southern parts of the kingdom of Leon. To the\r\nsame end were diverted D’Avenay’s[678] and Maupetit’s[679] brigades of\r\ncavalry. Quite contrary to Moore’s expectations and prophecies, the\r\npeople of this part of Spain displayed a frantic patriotism, when once\r\nthe enemy was upon them. Toro, an open town[680], had to be stormed:\r\nZamora made a still better resistance, repulsed a first attack, and\r\nhad to be breached and assaulted by a brigade of Lapisse’s division.\r\nThe villagers of Penilla distinguished themselves by falling upon and\r\ncapturing a battery of the Imperial Guard, which was passing by with an\r\ninsufficient escort. Of course the guns were recovered, and the place\r\nburnt, within a few days of the exploit[681].\r\n\r\n  [678] This was a temporary brigade, made up of the 3rd Dutch\r\n  Hussars and a provisional regiment of dragoons.\r\n\r\n  [679] 5th Dragoons and part of the regiment of Westphalian\r\n  _Chevaux-Légers_; they belonged to the corps-cavalry of Lefebvre.\r\n\r\n  [680] The defence of Toro was headed by a stray English officer.\r\n  The place was taken by D’Avenay, not by Maupetit as Arteche says.\r\n  See the _Mémoires_ of De Gonneville, i. 207.\r\n\r\n  [681] For information on these rather obscure operations consult\r\n  the _Mémoires_ of De Gonneville (of D’Avenay’s brigade) and _Nap.\r\n  Corresp._, 14,685.\r\n\r\nHaving sent off the Guards, Lapisse, Dessolles, and Maupetit’s and\r\nD’Avenay’s cavalry, the Emperor had still a large force left in hand\r\nfor the pursuit of Moore. There remained Soult’s and Ney’s corps,\r\nthe horsemen of Lahoussaye, Lorges, and Franceschi, and the greater\r\npart of Junot’s 8th Corps. The Emperor had resolved to break up this\r\nlast-named unit: it contained many third-battalions belonging to\r\nregiments which were already in Spain: they were directed to rejoin\r\ntheir respective head quarters. When this was done, there remained only\r\nenough to make up two rather weak divisions of 5,000 men each. These\r\nwere given to Delaborde and Heudelet, and incorporated with Soult’s\r\n2nd Corps. Loison’s division, the third of the original 8th Corps,\r\nwas suppressed[682]. Junot himself was sent off to take a command\r\nunder Lannes at the siege of Saragossa. When joined by Delaborde and\r\nHeudelet, Soult had a corps of exceptional strength--five divisions\r\nand nearly 30,000 bayonets. He could not use for the pursuit of Moore\r\nBonnet’s division, which had been left to garrison Santander. But\r\nwith the remainder, 25,000 strong, he pressed forward from Astorga in\r\npursuance of his master’s orders. His cavalry force was very large\r\nin proportion: it consisted of 6,000 sabres, for not only were three\r\ncomplete divisions of dragoons with him, but Ney’s corps-cavalry (the\r\nbrigade of Colbert) was up at the front and leading the pursuit. Ney\r\nhimself, with his two infantry divisions, those of Maurice Mathieu and\r\nMarchand, was a march or two to the rear, some 16,000 bayonets strong.\r\nIf Soult should suffer any check, he was sure of prompt support within\r\nthree days. Thus the whole force sent in chase of Moore mustered some\r\n47,000 men[683].\r\n\r\n  [682] There were only two battalions remaining with Loison by\r\n  Jan. 10.\r\n\r\n  [683] A month after the pursuit of Moore had ended, and the\r\n  battle of Corunna had been fought, the four infantry divisions of\r\n  Soult’s corps which were in Galicia had still 19,000 effective\r\n  bayonets for the invasion of Portugal. The three cavalry\r\n  divisions were some 5,300 strong. Ney’s corps, which had hardly\r\n  been engaged, had 16,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry. There were\r\n  still, therefore, 41,300 men in hand of the two corps. It is\r\n  impossible to make the losses from the long pursuit in the snow\r\n  and the battle of Corunna less than 4,500 or 5,000 men, when we\r\n  reflect that Moore lost 6,000, of whom only 2,000 were prisoners,\r\n  and that Soult suffered at least 1,500 casualties in the Corunna\r\n  fighting.\r\n\r\nThe head of the pursuing column was formed by Lahoussaye’s dragoons and\r\nColbert’s light cavalry: in support of these, but always some miles to\r\nthe rear, came Merle’s infantry. This formed the French van: the rest\r\nof Soult’s troops were a march behind, with Heudelet’s division for\r\nrearguard. All the 2nd Corps followed the English on the Manzanal road:\r\nonly Franceschi’s four regiments of cavalry turned aside, to follow the\r\nrugged pass of Foncebadon, by which La Romana’s dilapidated host had\r\nretired. The exhausted Spaniards were making but slow progress through\r\nthe snow and the mountain torrents. Franceschi caught them up on\r\nJanuary 2, and scattered their rearguard under General Rengel, taking\r\na couple of flags and some 1,500 men: the prisoners are described as\r\nbeing in the last extremity of misery and fatigue, and many of them\r\nwere infected with the typhus fever, which had been hanging about this\r\nunfortunate corps ever since its awful experience in the Cantabrian\r\nhills during the month of November[684].\r\n\r\n  [684] _Nap. Corresp._, 14,662. ‘Les hommes pris sur La Romana\r\n  étaient horribles à voir,’ says Napoleon, who saw them at Astorga.\r\n\r\nMoore’s army, as we have already seen, had marched out from\r\nAstorga--the main body on December 30, the rearguard on the\r\nthirty-first. After determining that he would not defend the passes\r\nof Manzanal and Foncebadon, the general had doubted whether he should\r\nmake his retreat on Corunna by the great _chaussée_, or on Vigo, by\r\nthe minor road which goes via Orense and the valley of the Sil. It is\r\nstrange that he did not see that his mind must be promptly made up, and\r\nthat when once he had passed the mountains he must commit himself to\r\none or the other route. But his dispatches to Castlereagh show that it\r\nwas not till he had reached Lugo that he finally decided in favour of\r\nthe main road[685]. He must have formed the erroneous conclusion that\r\nthe French would not pursue him far beyond Astorga[686]: he thought\r\nthat they would be stopped by want of provisions and by fatigue. Having\r\nformed this unsound hypothesis, he put off the final decision as to his\r\nroute till he should reach Lugo. Meanwhile, to protect the side-road\r\nto Vigo he detached 3,500 of his best troops, Robert Crawfurd’s\r\nlight brigade [the 43rd (1st batt.), 52nd (2nd batt.), and 95th (2nd\r\nbatt.)], and Alten’s brigade of the German Legion. They diverged from\r\nthe main road after leaving Astorga, and marched, by Ponferrada and\r\nLa Rua, on Orense. How much they suffered on the miserable bypaths\r\nof the valley of the Sil may be gathered in the interesting diaries\r\nof Surtees and Harris: but it was only with the snow and the want of\r\nfood that they had to contend. They never saw a Frenchman, embarked\r\nunmolested at Vigo, and were absolutely useless to Moore during the\r\nrest of the campaign. It is impossible to understand how it came that\r\nthey were sent away in this fashion, and nothing can be said in favour\r\nof the move. Unless the whole army were going by the Orense road, no\r\none should have been sent along it: and the difficulties of the track\r\nwere such that to have taken the main body over it would have been\r\npractically impossible. As it was, 3,500 fine soldiers were wasted for\r\nall fighting purposes. The duty of covering the rear of the army, which\r\nhad hitherto fallen to the lot of Crawfurd, was now transferred to\r\nGeneral Paget and the ‘Reserve Division[687].’ One regiment of hussars\r\n[the 15th] was left with them: the other four cavalry corps pushed on\r\nto the front, as there was no great opportunity for using them, now\r\nthat the army had plunged into the mountains.\r\n\r\n  [685] This is made absolutely certain by his letter of Jan.\r\n  13, in which he says that ‘at Lugo I became sensible of the\r\n  impossibility of reaching Vigo, which is at too great a\r\n  distance.’ On starting from Astorga, then, he still thought\r\n  that he might be able to embark at that port. A glance at the\r\n  map shows that the march Astorga-Lugo-Vigo is two sides of a\r\n  triangle. If the Vigo route was to be taken, the only rational\r\n  places to turn on to it are Astorga and Ponferrada.\r\n\r\n  [686] ‘After a time the same difficulties which affect us must\r\n  affect him [Soult]: therefore the rear once past Villafranca,\r\n  I do not expect to be molested’ (Moore to Castlereagh, from\r\n  Astorga, Dec. 31).\r\n\r\n  [687] Consisting of the 20th Foot, and the first battalions of\r\n  the 28th, 52nd, 91st, and 95th.\r\n\r\nColbert and Lahoussaye took some little time, after leaving Astorga,\r\nbefore they came upon the rear of Moore’s army. But they had no\r\ndifficulty in ascertaining the route that the English had taken: the\r\nsteep uphill road from Astorga into the Vierzo was strewn with wreckage\r\nof all kinds, which had been abandoned by the retreating troops. The\r\nlong twelve-mile incline, deeply covered with snow, had proved fatal\r\nto a vast number of draught animals, and wagon after wagon had to\r\nbe abandoned to the pursuers, for want of sufficient oxen and mules\r\nto drag them further forward. Among the derelict baggage were lying\r\nno small number of exhausted stragglers, dead or dying from cold or\r\ndysentery.\r\n\r\nThe whole _morale_ of Moore’s army had suffered a dreadful\r\ndeterioration from the moment that the order to evacuate Astorga was\r\nissued. As long as there was any prospect of fighting, the men--though\r\nsurly and discontented--had stuck to their colours. Some regiments had\r\nbegun to maraud, but the majority were still in good order. But from\r\nAstorga onward the discipline of the greater part of the corps began to\r\nrelax. There were about a dozen regiments[688] which behaved thoroughly\r\nwell, and came through the retreat with insignificant losses: on the\r\nother hand there were many others which left from thirty to forty\r\nper cent. of their men behind them. It cannot be disguised that the\r\nenormous difference between the proportion of ‘missing’ in battalions\r\nof the same brigade, which went through exactly identical experiences,\r\nwas simply due to the varying degrees of zeal and energy with which the\r\nofficers kept their men together. Where there was a strong controlling\r\nwill the stragglers were few, and no one fell behind save those who\r\nwere absolutely dying. The iron hand of Robert Crawfurd brought the\r\n43rd and 95th through their troubles with a loss of eighty or ninety\r\nmen each. The splendid discipline of the Guards brigade carried them to\r\nCorunna with even smaller proportional losses. There is no mistaking\r\nthe coincidence when we find that the battalion which Moore denounced\r\nat Salamanca as being the worst commanded and the worst disciplined\r\nin his force, was also the one which left a higher percentage of\r\nstragglers behind than any other corps. The fact was that the toils\r\nof the retreat tried the machinery of the regiments to the utmost,\r\nand that where the management was weak or incompetent discipline broke\r\ndown. It was not the troops who had the longest marches or the most\r\nfighting that suffered the heaviest losses: those of Paget’s division,\r\nthe rearguard of the whole army, which was constantly in touch with\r\nthe French advance, compare favourably with those of some corps which\r\nnever fired a shot between Benavente and Corunna. It is sad to have\r\nto confess that half the horrors of the retreat were due to purely\r\npreventible causes, and that if the badly-managed regiments had been up\r\nto the disciplinary standard of the Guards or the Light Brigade, the\r\nwhole march would have been remembered as toilsome but not disastrous.\r\nMoore himself wrote, in the last dispatch to which he ever set his\r\nhand, that ‘he would not have believed, had he not witnessed it,\r\nthat a British army would in so short a time have been so completely\r\ndemoralized. Its conduct during the late marches was infamous beyond\r\nbelief. He could say nothing in its favour but that when there was a\r\nprospect of fighting the men were at once steady, and seemed pleased\r\nand determined to do their duty[689].’ This denunciation was far too\r\nsweeping, for many corps kept good order throughout the whole campaign:\r\nbut there was only too much to justify Moore’s anger.\r\n\r\n  [688] The reader should note, in the Appendix dealing with the\r\n  numbers of Moore’s army, the very small proportional losses\r\n  suffered by the two battalions of the Guards, the 43rd (1st\r\n  batt.), 4th, 42nd, 71st, 79th, 92nd, 95th (2nd batt.), and the\r\n  cavalry.\r\n\r\n  [689] I quote from the original in the Record Office, not from\r\n  the mutilated version printed in the _Parliamentary Papers_ and\r\n  elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe serious trouble began at Bembibre, the first place beyond the pass\r\nof Manzanal, where Hope’s, Baird’s, and Fraser’s divisions had encamped\r\non the night of the thirty-first. The village was unfortunately a\r\nlarge local dépôt for wine: slinking off from their companies, many\r\nhundreds of marauders made their way into the vaults and cellars.\r\nWhen the divisions marched next morning they left nearly a thousand\r\nmen, in various stages of intoxication, lying about the houses and\r\nstreets. The officers of Paget’s Reserve, who came up that afternoon,\r\ndescribe Bembibre as looking like a battle-field, so thickly were the\r\nprostrate redcoats strewn in every corner. Vigorous endeavours were\r\nmade to rouse these bad soldiers, and to start them upon their way;\r\nbut even next morning there were multitudes who could not or would not\r\nmarch[690]. When the Reserve evacuated the place on January 2, it\r\nwas still full of torpid stragglers. Suddenly there appeared on the\r\nscene the leading brigade of Lahoussaye’s dragoons, pushing down from\r\nthe pass of Manzanal, and driving before them the last hussar picket\r\nwhich Paget had left behind. The noise of the horsemen roused the\r\nlingerers, who began at last to stagger away, but it was too late: ‘the\r\ncavalry rode through the long line of these lame defenceless wretches,\r\nslashing among them as a schoolboy does among thistles[691].’ Most of\r\nthe stragglers, it is said, were still so insensible from liquor that\r\nthey made no resistance, and did not even get out of the road[692]. A\r\nfew, with dreadful cuts about their heads and shoulders, succeeded in\r\novertaking the Reserve. Moore had the poor bleeding wretches paraded\r\nalong the front of the regiments, as a warning to drunkards and\r\nmalingerers.\r\n\r\n  [690] Blakeney, of the 28th, says: ‘We employed the greater part\r\n  of Jan. 1 in turning or dragging the drunken men out of the\r\n  houses into the streets, and sending forward as many as could\r\n  be moved. Yet little could be effected with men incapable of\r\n  standing, much less of marching’ (p. 50).\r\n\r\n  [691] ‘T.S.’ of the 71st (_Journal_, p. 58).\r\n\r\n  [692] Adam Neale, p. 188. Both he and ‘T.S.’ mention the parading\r\n  of the wounded men along the lines.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Baird and Hope’s divisions had reached Villafranca on the\r\nfirst, and scenes almost as disgraceful as those of Bembibre were\r\noccurring. The town was Moore’s most important dépôt: it contained\r\nfourteen days’ rations of biscuit for the whole army, an immense amount\r\nof salt-beef and pork, and some hundreds of barrels of rum. There\r\nwas no transport to carry off all this valuable provender, and Moore\r\nordered it to be given to the flames. Hearing of this the troops broke\r\ninto the magazines, and began to load themselves with all and more than\r\nthey could carry, arguing, not unnaturally, that so much good food\r\nshould not be burnt. Moore ordered one man--who was caught breaking\r\ninto the rum store--to be shot in the square. But it was no use; the\r\nsoldiers burst loose, though many of their officers cut and slashed at\r\nthem to keep them in the ranks, and snatched all that they could from\r\nthe fires. Some forced open private houses and plundered, and in a few\r\ncases maltreated, or even murdered, the townsfolk who would not give\r\nthem drink. A great many got at the rum, and were left behind when the\r\ndivisions marched on January 3[693].\r\n\r\n  [693] Cf. Blakeney, Neale, Londonderry, and James Moore.\r\n\r\nWhile these orgies were going on at Villafranca, Paget and the Reserve\r\nhad been halted six miles away, at Cacabellos, where the high-road\r\npasses over the little river Cua[694]. There was here a position in\r\nwhich a whole army could stand at bay, and Moore’s engineers had\r\npointed it out to him as the post between Astorga and Lugo where there\r\nwas the most favourable fighting-ground. It is certain that if he had\r\nchosen to offer battle to Soult on this front, the Marshal would have\r\nbeen checked for many days--he could not have got forward without\r\ncalling up Ney from Astorga, and there is no good road by which the\r\nBritish could have been outflanked. But Moore had no intention of\r\nmaking a serious defence: he was fighting a rearguard action merely to\r\nallow time for the stores at Villafranca to be destroyed.\r\n\r\n  [694] Not the Guia, as the English generally call it.\r\n\r\nThe forces which were halted at Cacabellos consisted of the five\r\nbattalions of the Reserve (under Paget), the 15th Hussars, and a\r\nhorse-artillery battery. A squadron of the cavalry and half of the\r\n95th Rifles were left beyond the river, in observation along the road\r\ntowards Bembibre: the guns were placed on the western side of the Cua,\r\ncommanding the road up from the bridge. The 28th formed their escort,\r\nwhile the other three battalions of the division were hidden behind a\r\nline of vineyards and stone walls parallel with the winding stream[695].\r\n\r\n  [695] I take my account of the skirmish mainly from Blakeney,\r\n  whose narrative is admirable. Those of Londonderry, Napier, and\r\n  Neale do not give so many details.\r\n\r\nAbout one o’clock in the afternoon the French appeared, pushing\r\ncautiously forward from Bembibre with Colbert’s cavalry brigade of\r\nNey’s corps now at their head, while Lahoussaye’s division of dragoons\r\nwas in support. The infantry were not yet in sight. Colbert, a young\r\nand very dashing officer, currently reputed to be the most handsome man\r\nin the whole French army, was burning to distinguish himself. He had\r\nnever before met the British, and had formed a poor opinion of them\r\nfrom the numerous stragglers and drunkards whom he had seen upon the\r\nroad. He thought that the rearguard might be pushed, and the defile\r\nforced with little loss. Accordingly he rode forward at the head of\r\nhis two regiments[696], and fell upon the squadron of the 15th Hussars\r\nwhich was observing him. They had to fly in hot haste, and, coming in\r\nsuddenly to the bridge, rode into and over the last two companies of\r\nthe 95th Rifles, who had not yet crossed the stream. Colbert, sweeping\r\ndown close to their heels, came upon the disordered infantry and took\r\nsome forty or fifty prisoners before the riflemen could escape across\r\nthe water[697]. But, seeing the 28th and the guns holding the slope\r\nabove, he halted for a moment before attempting to proceed further.\r\n\r\n  [696] They were the 15th Chasseurs and the 3rd Hussars.\r\n\r\n  [697] Forty-eight is the number given in Cope’s excellent\r\n  _History of the Rifle Brigade_.\r\n\r\nJudging however, from a hasty survey, that there were no very great\r\nnumbers opposed to him, the young French general resolved to attempt to\r\ncarry the bridge of Cacabellos by a furious charge, just as Franceschi\r\nhad forced that of Mansilla five days before. This was a most hazardous\r\nand ill-advised move: it could only succeed against demoralized troops,\r\nand was bound to fail when tried against the steady battalions of\r\nthe Reserve division. But ranging his leading regiment four abreast,\r\nColbert charged for the bridge: the six guns opposite him tore the head\r\nof the column to pieces, but the majority of the troopers got across\r\nand tried to dash uphill and capture the position. They had fallen\r\ninto a dreadful trap, for the 28th blocked the road just beyond the\r\nbridge, while the 95th and 52nd poured in a hot flanking fire from\r\nbehind the vineyard walls on either side. There was no getting forward:\r\nColbert himself was shot as he tried to urge on his men[698], and his\r\naide-de-camp Latour-Maubourg fell at his side. After staying for no\r\nmore than a few minutes on the further side of the water, the brigade\r\nturned rein and plunged back across the bridge, leaving many scores of\r\ndead and wounded behind them.\r\n\r\n  [698] He was shot by Tom Plunket, a noted character in the 95th,\r\n  from a range that seemed extraordinary to the riflemen of that\r\n  day.\r\n\r\nLahoussaye’s dragoons now came to the front: several squadrons of\r\nthem forded the river at different points, but, unable to charge\r\namong the rocks and vines, they were forced to dismount and to act as\r\nskirmishers, a capacity in which they competed to no great advantage\r\nagainst the 52nd, with whom they found themselves engaged. It was\r\nnot till the leading infantry of Merle’s division came up, not long\r\nbefore dusk, that the French were enabled to make any head against\r\nthe defenders. Their voltigeurs bickered with the 95th and 52nd for\r\nan hour, but when the formed columns tried to cross the bridge, they\r\nwere so raked by the six guns opposite them that they gave back in\r\ndisorder. After dark the firing ceased, and Moore, who had come up in\r\nperson from Villafranca at the sound of the cannon, had no difficulty\r\nin withdrawing his men under cover of the night. In this sharp skirmish\r\neach side lost some 200 men: the French casualties were mainly in\r\nColbert’s cavalry, the British were distributed unequally between the\r\n95th (who suffered most), the 28th, and 52nd: the other two regiments\r\npresent (the 20th and 91st) were hardly engaged[699].\r\n\r\n  [699] Napoleon’s not very convincing account of the combat (_Nap.\r\n  Corresp._, 14,647) runs as follows: ‘Trois mille Ecossais,\r\n  voulant défendre les gorges de Picros près de Villafranca, pour\r\n  donner le temps à beaucoup de choses à filer, ont été culbutés.\r\n  Mais le général Colbert pétillant de faire avancer sa cavalerie,\r\n  une balle l’a frappé au front, et l’a tué.’\r\n\r\nMarching all through the night of 3rd-4th of January the Reserve\r\ndivision passed through Villafranca, where stores of all kinds were\r\nstill blazing in huge bonfires, and did not halt till they reached\r\nNogales, eighteen miles further on. They found the road before them\r\nstrewn with one continuous line of wreckage from the regiments of\r\nthe main body. The country beyond Villafranca was far more bare and\r\ndesolate than the eastern half of the Vierzo: discipline grew worse\r\neach day, and the surviving animals of the baggage-train were dying\r\noff wholesale from cold and want of forage. The cavalry horses were\r\nalso beginning to perish very fast, mainly from losing their shoes on\r\nthe rough and stony road. As soon as a horse was unable to keep up\r\nwith the regiment, he was (by Lord Paget’s orders) shot by his rider,\r\nin order to prevent him from falling into the hands of the French.\r\nMany witnesses of the retreat state that the incessant cracking of the\r\nhussars’ pistols, as the unfortunate chargers were shot, was the thing\r\nthat lingered longest in their memories of all the sounds of these\r\nunhappy days.\r\n\r\nBeyond Villafranca the Corunna road passes through the picturesque\r\ndefile of Piedrafita, by which it reaches the head waters of the Nava\r\nriver, and then climbing the spurs of Monte Cebrero comes out into\r\nthe bleak upland plain of Lugo. This fifty miles contained the most\r\ndifficult and desolate country in the whole of Moore’s march, and\r\nwas the scene of more helpless and undeserved misery than any other\r\nsection of the retreat. It was not merely drunkards and marauders who\r\nnow began to fall to the rear, but steady old soldiers who could not\r\nface the cold, the semi-starvation, and the forced marches. Moore\r\nhurried his troops forward at a pace that, over such roads, could only\r\nbe kept up by the strongest men. On January 5 he compelled the whole\r\narmy to execute a forced march of no less than thirty-six continuous\r\nhours, which was almost as deadly as a battle. This haste seems all\r\nthe less justifiable because the district abounded with positions\r\nat which the enemy could be held back for many hours, whenever the\r\nrearguard was told to stand at bay. At Nogales and Constantino, where\r\nopposition was offered, the French were easily checked, and there were\r\nmany other points where similar stands could have been made. It would\r\nseem that Moore, shocked at the state of indiscipline into which his\r\nregiments were falling, thought only of getting to the sea as quickly\r\nas possible. Certainly, the pursuit was not so vigorous as to make\r\nsuch frantic haste necessary. Whenever the Reserve division halted and\r\noffered battle, the French dragoons held off, and waited, often for\r\nmany hours, for their infantry to come up.\r\n\r\n‘All that had hitherto been suffered by our troops was but a prelude\r\nto this time of horrors,’ wrote one British eye-witness. ‘It had still\r\nbeen attempted to carry forward our sick and wounded: here (on Monte\r\nCebrero) the beasts which dragged them failed, and they were left in\r\ntheir wagons, to perish among the snow. As we looked round on gaining\r\nthe highest point of these slippery precipices, and observed the rear\r\nof the army winding along the narrow road, we could see the whole track\r\nmarked out by our own wretched people, who lay expiring from fatigue\r\nand the severity of the cold--while their uniforms reddened in spots\r\nthe white surface of the ground. Our men had now become quite mad with\r\ndespair: excessive fatigue and the consciousness of disgrace, in thus\r\nflying before an enemy whom they despised, excited in them a spirit\r\nwhich was quite mutinous. A few hours’ pause was all they asked, an\r\nopportunity of confronting the foe, and the certainty of making the\r\npursuers atone for all the miseries that they had suffered. Not allowed\r\nto fight, they cast themselves down to perish by the wayside, giving\r\nutterance to feelings of shame, anger, and grief. But too frequently\r\ntheir dying groans were mingled with imprecations upon the General, who\r\nchose rather to let them die like beasts than to take their chance on\r\nthe field of battle. That no degree of horror might be wanting, this\r\nunfortunate army was accompanied by many women and children, of whom\r\nsome were frozen to death on the abandoned baggage-wagons, some died\r\nof fatigue and cold, while their infants were seen vainly sucking at\r\ntheir clay-cold breasts[700].’ It is shocking to have to add that the\r\nmiserable survivors of these poor women of the camp were abominably\r\nmaltreated by the French[701].\r\n\r\n  [700] From Adam Neale’s _Spanish Campaign of 1808_, pp. 190, 191.\r\n\r\n  [701] For French evidence of this see the journal of Fantin des\r\n  Odoards of the 31st Léger: ‘Plusieurs jeunes Anglaises devenues\r\n  la proie de nos cavaliers étaient mises à l’encan en même temps\r\n  que les chevaux pris avec elles. J’ai vu, à mon grand scandale,\r\n  qu’elles n’avaient pas toujours la préférence’ (p. 196). Cf. the\r\n  miserable story of Mrs. Pullen in the _Recollections of Rifleman\r\n  Harris_, p. 142.\r\n\r\nNot only was the greater part of the baggage-train of the army lost\r\nbetween Villafranca and Lugo, but other things of more importance. A\r\nbattery of Spanish guns was left behind on the crest of Monte Oribio\r\nfor want of draught animals, and the military chest of the army was\r\nabandoned between Nogales and Cerezal. It contained about £25,000 in\r\ndollars, and was drawn in two ox-wagons, which gradually fell behind\r\nthe main body as the beasts wore out. General Paget refused to fight\r\na rearguard action to cover its slow progress, and ordered the 28th\r\nRegiment to hurl the small kegs containing the money over a precipice.\r\nThe silver shower lay scattered among the rocks at the bottom: part was\r\ngathered up by Lahoussaye’s dragoons, but the bulk fell next spring,\r\nwhen the snow melted, into the hands of the local peasantry [Jan. 4].\r\n\r\nOn the further side of the mountains, between Cerezal and Constantino,\r\nthe army was astounded to meet a long train of fifty bullock-carts\r\nmoving southward. It contained clothing and stores for La Romana’s\r\narmy, which the Junta of Galicia, with incredible carelessness, had\r\nsent forward from Lugo, though it had heard that the British were\r\nretreating. A few miles of further advance would have taken it into the\r\nhands of the French. Very naturally, the soldiery stripped the wagons\r\nand requisitioned the beasts for their own baggage. The shoes and\r\ngarments were a godsend to those of the ragged battalions who could lay\r\nhands on them, and next day at Constantino many of the Reserve fought\r\nin whole- or half-Spanish uniforms.\r\n\r\nThe skirmish at Constantino, on the afternoon of January 5, was the\r\nmost important engagement, save that of Cacabellos, during the whole\r\nretreat. It was a typical rearguard action to cover a bridge: the\r\nBritish engineers having failed in their endeavour to blow up the\r\ncentral arch, Paget placed his guns so as to command the passage,\r\nextended the 28th and the 95th along the nearer bank of the deep-sunk\r\nriver, and held out with ease till nightfall. Lahoussaye’s dragoons\r\nrefused, very wisely, to attempt the position. Merle’s infantry tried\r\nto force the passage by sending forward a regiment in dense column,\r\nwhich suffered heavily from the guns, was much mauled by the British\r\nlight troops ranged along the water’s edge, and finally desisted from\r\nthe attack, allowing Paget to withdraw unmolested after dark. The\r\nFrench were supposed to have lost about 300 men--a figure which was\r\nprobably exaggerated: the British casualties were insignificant.\r\n\r\nOn January 6 Paget and the rearguard reached Lugo, where they found\r\nthe main body of the army drawn out in battle order on a favourable\r\nposition three miles outside the town. The fearful amount of straggling\r\nwhich had taken place during the forced marches of the fourth and fifth\r\nhad induced Moore to halt on his march to the sea, in order to rest his\r\nmen, restore discipline, and allow the laggards to come up. A tiresome\r\n_contretemps_ had made him still more anxious to allow the army time to\r\nrecruit itself. He had made up his mind at Herrerias (near Villafranca)\r\nthat the wild idea of retiring on Vigo must be given up. The reports\r\nof the engineer officers whom he had sent to survey that port, as well\r\nas Ferrol and Corunna, were all in favour of the last-named place.\r\nAccordingly he had sent orders to the admiral at Vigo, bidding him\r\nbring the fleet of transports round to Corunna. At the same time Baird\r\nwas directed to halt at Lugo, and not to take the side-road to Vigo\r\nvia Compostella. Baird duly received the dispatch, and should have\r\nseen that it was sent on to his colleagues, Hope and Fraser. He gave\r\nthe letter for Fraser to a private dragoon, who got drunk and lost\r\nthe important document. Hence the 3rd Division started off on the\r\nCompostella road, a bad bypath, and went many miles across the snow\r\nbefore it was found and recalled. Baird’s negligence cost Fraser’s\r\nbattalions 400 men in stragglers, and having marched and countermarched\r\nmore than twenty miles, they returned to Lugo so thoroughly worn\r\nout that they could not possibly have resumed their retreat on the\r\nsixth[702].\r\n\r\n  [702] The whole of this story may be found in Londonderry (i.\r\n  272), Ormsby (ii. 140), James Moore (p. 190), as well as in\r\n  Napier.\r\n\r\nMoore had found in Lugo a dépôt containing four or five\r\ndays’ provisions for the whole force, as well as a welcome\r\nreinforcement--Leith’s brigade of Hope’s division, which had never\r\nmarched to Astorga, and had been preceding the army by easy stages\r\nin its retreat. Including these 1,800 fresh bayonets, the army now\r\nmustered about 19,000 combatants. Since it left Benavente it had been\r\ndiminished by the strength of the two Light Brigades detached to Vigo\r\n(3,500 men), by 1,000 dismounted cavalry who had been sent on to\r\nCorunna, by 500 or 600 sick too ill to be moved, who had been left in\r\nthe hospitals of Astorga and Villafranca, and by about 2,000 men lost\r\nby the way between Astorga and Lugo. Moore imagined that the loss under\r\nthe last-named head had been even greater: but the moment that the\r\narmy halted and the news of approaching battle flew round, hundreds of\r\nstragglers and marauders flocked in to the colours, sick men pulled\r\nthemselves together, and the regiments appeared far stronger than had\r\nbeen anticipated. The Commander-in-chief issued a scathing ‘General\r\nOrder’ to the officers commanding corps with regard to this point.\r\n‘They must be as sensible as himself of the complete disorganization\r\nof the army. If they wished to give the troops a fair chance of\r\nsuccess, they must exert themselves to restore order and discipline.\r\nThe Commander of the Forces was tired of giving orders which were never\r\nattended to: he therefore appealed to the honour and feelings of the\r\narmy: if those were not sufficient to induce them to do their duty, he\r\nmust despair of succeeding by any other means. He had been obliged to\r\norder military executions, but there would have been no need for them\r\nif only officers did their duty. It was chiefly from their negligence,\r\nand from the want of proper regulations in the regiments, that crimes\r\nand irregularities were committed[703].’\r\n\r\n  [703] General Orders (Lugo, Jan. 6, 1809).\r\n\r\nThe Lugo position was very strong: on the right it touched the\r\nunfordable river Minho, on the left it rested on rocky and inaccessible\r\nhills. All along the front there was a line of low stone walls, the\r\nboundaries of fields and vineyards. Below it there was a gentle\r\ndown-slope of a mile, up which the enemy would have to march in order\r\nto attack. The army and the general alike were pleased with the\r\noutlook: they hoped that Soult would fight, and knew that they could\r\ngive a good account of him.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal turned out to be far too circumspect to run his head\r\nagainst such a formidable line. He came up on the sixth, with the\r\ndragoons of Lahoussaye and Franceschi and Merle’s infantry. On the\r\nnext morning Mermet’s and Delaborde’s divisions and Lorges’s cavalry\r\nappeared. But the forced marches had tried them no less than they\r\nhad tried the British. French accounts say that the three infantry\r\ndivisions had only 13,000 bayonets with the eagles, instead of the\r\n20,000 whom they should have shown, and that the cavalry instead of\r\n6,000 sabres mustered only 4,000. Some men had fallen by the way in\r\nthe snow, others were limping along the road many miles to the rear:\r\nmany were marauding on the flanks, like the British who had gone before\r\nthem. Heudelet’s whole division was more than two marches to the rear,\r\nat Villafranca.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh, therefore, Soult did no more than feel the British\r\nposition. He had not at first been sure that Moore’s whole army was in\r\nfront of him, and imagined that he might have to deal with no more than\r\nPaget’s Reserve division, with which he had bickered so much during\r\nthe last four days. He was soon undeceived: when he brought forward\r\na battery against Moore’s centre, it was immediately silenced by the\r\nfire of fifteen guns. A feint opposite the British right, near the\r\nriver, was promptly opposed by the Brigade of Guards. A more serious\r\nattack by Merle’s division, on the hill to the left, was beaten back by\r\nLeith’s brigade, who drove back the 2nd Léger and 36th of the Line by a\r\nbayonet-charge downhill, and inflicted on them a loss of 300 men.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth many of Soult’s stragglers came up, but he still\r\nconsidered himself too weak to attack, and sent back to hurry up\r\nHeudelet’s division, and to request Ney to push forward his corps to\r\nVillafranca. He remained quiescent all day, to the great disappointment\r\nof Moore, who had issued orders to his army warning them that a\r\nbattle was at hand, and bidding them not to waste their fire on the\r\ntirailleurs, but reserve it for the supporting columns. As the day wore\r\non, without any sign of movement on the part of the French, the British\r\ncommander began to grow anxious and depressed. If Soult would not move,\r\nit must mean that he had resolved to draw up heavy reinforcements from\r\nthe rear. It would be mad to wait till they should come up: either the\r\nMarshal must be attacked at once, before he could be strengthened,\r\nor else the army must resume its retreat on Corunna before Soult was\r\nready. To take the offensive Moore considered very doubtful policy--the\r\nFrench had about his own numbers, or perhaps even more, and they were\r\nestablished in a commanding position almost as strong as his own. Even\r\nif he beat them, they could fall back on Heudelet and Ney, and face\r\nhim again, in or about Villafranca. To win a second battle would be\r\nhard work, and, even if all went well, the army would be so reduced in\r\nnumbers that practically nothing would remain for a descent into the\r\nplains of Leon.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Moore resolved neither to attack nor to wait to be\r\nattacked, but to resume his retreat towards the sea. It was not a very\r\nenterprising course; but it was at least a safe one; and since the\r\ntroops were now somewhat rested, and (as he hoped) restored to good\r\nspirits, by seeing that the enemy dared not face them, he considered\r\nthat he might withdraw without evil results. Accordingly the evening of\r\nthe eighth was spent in destroying impedimenta and making preparations\r\nfor retreat. Five hundred foundered cavalry and artillery horses were\r\nshot, a number of caissons knocked to pieces, and the remainder of\r\nthe stores of food destroyed so far as was possible. At midnight on\r\nJanuary 8-9 the army silently slipped out of its lines, leaving its\r\nbivouac fires burning, so as to delude the enemy with the idea that it\r\nstill lay before him. Elaborate precautions had been taken to guide\r\neach division to the point from which it could fall with the greatest\r\nease into the Corunna road. But it is not easy to evacuate by night a\r\nlong position intersected with walls, enclosures, and suburban bypaths.\r\nMoreover the fates were unpropitious: drenching rain had set in, and\r\nit was impossible to see five yards in the stormy darkness. Whole\r\nregiments and brigades got astray, and of all the four divisions only\r\nPaget’s Reserve kept its bearings accurately and reached the _chaussée_\r\nexactly at the destined point. For miles on each side of the road\r\nstray battalions were wandering in futile circles when the day dawned.\r\nInstead of marching fifteen miles under cover of the night, many\r\ncorps had got no further than four or five from their starting-point.\r\nIsolated men were scattered all over the face of the country-side,\r\nsome because they had lost their regiments, others because they had\r\ndeliberately sought shelter from the rain behind any convenient wall or\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nContinuing their retreat for some hours after daybreak, the troops\r\nreached the village of Valmeda, where their absolute exhaustion made\r\na halt necessary. The more prudent commanders made their men lie down\r\nin their ranks, in spite of the downpour, and eat as they lay. But\r\nBaird, from mistaken kindness, allowed his division to disperse and to\r\nseek shelter in the cottages and barns of neighbouring hamlets: they\r\ncould not be got together again when the time to start had arrived, and\r\nBentinck and Manningham’s brigades left an enormous proportion of their\r\nmen behind. The same thing happened on a smaller scale with Hope’s\r\nand Fraser’s divisions: only Paget’s regiments brought up the rear\r\nin good order. But behind them trailed several thousand stragglers,\r\nforming a sort of irregular rearguard. There was more dispersion,\r\ndisorder, and marauding in this march than in any other during the\r\nwhole retreat. The plundering during this stage seems to have been\r\nparticularly discreditable: the inhabitants of the villages along the\r\nhigh-road had for the most part gone up into the hills, in spite of\r\nthe dreadful weather. The British seem to have imputed their absence\r\nto them as a crime, and to have regarded every empty house as a fair\r\nfield for plunder. As a matter of fact it was not with the desire of\r\nwithholding aid from their friends that the Galicians had disappeared,\r\nbut from fear of the French. If they had remained behind they would\r\nhave been stripped and misused by the enemy. But the unreasoning\r\nsoldiery chose to regard the unfortunate peasants as hostile[704]:\r\nthey wantonly broke up doors and furniture, and stole all manner of\r\nuseless household stuff. Even worse outrages occasionally happened:\r\nwhere the inhabitants, in outlying farms and hamlets, had remained\r\nbehind, they turned them out of their houses, robbed them by force,\r\nand even shot those who resisted. In return, it was but natural that\r\nisolated marauders should be killed by the angry country-folk. But the\r\ngood spirit of the Galicians was displayed in many places by the way\r\nin which they fed stragglers[705], and saved them from the French by\r\nshowing them bypaths over the hills. No less than 500 men who had lost\r\ntheir way were passed on from village to village by the peasants, till\r\nthey reached Portugal.\r\n\r\n  [704] In defence of the unfortunate Galicians, whose patriotism\r\n  and good faith has been impugned by so many English narrators\r\n  of the retreat, it is only necessary to quote the reflections\r\n  of two dispassionate eye-witnesses. Leith Hay (i. 132) writes:\r\n  ‘To expect that the peasantry were to rush from their houses,\r\n  and supply the wants of our soldiers with the only provision\r\n  that they possessed for their own families--who might in\r\n  consequence be left in the midst of the mountains, at midwinter,\r\n  to starve--was imagining friendly feeling carried to an unnatural\r\n  extent, and just as likely to happen as it would have been\r\n  if, Napoleon having invaded Britain, an English yeoman should\r\n  have earnestly requested one of our own soldiers to accept the\r\n  last morsel of bread he had the means of obtaining for his\r\n  children.’ Ormsby (ii. 162) says, to much the same effect: ‘As\r\n  to their inhospitable reception of us, and the concealment of\r\n  provisions, in candour I must be their apologist, and declare\r\n  my conviction that the charge in many instances is unfounded\r\n  and in others exaggerated. Do those who are most loud in their\r\n  complaints honestly think that an army of 30,000 Spaniards would\r\n  be better received in England than we were in Spain? I doubt\r\n  it much. The people, dispirited and alarmed, began to look to\r\n  self-preservation as the primary or sole object of their care.\r\n  Add to this the horror and dismay which the excesses of our\r\n  soldiers struck, and you will not be surprised that villages and\r\n  houses were frequently deserted. Is it a matter of astonishment\r\n  that the peasantry fled into the recesses of their mountains,\r\n  intimidated by our presence and confounded by our crimes?’\r\n\r\n  [705] For instances of kindness shown by the peasantry see Ormsby\r\n  (ii. 139). On the other hand the educated classes were often\r\n  sulky, and even insolent, because they thought that Moore was\r\n  deliberately abandoning Spain from cowardice. See in Ormsby the\r\n  anecdotes of the Alcalde of Pinhalla (ii. 79) and the Alcalde of\r\n  Villafranca (ii. 127), as also of the abuse which he got from a\r\n  ‘furious canon of Lugo,’ on whom he was billeted (ii. 147, 148).\r\n\r\nWhat between deliberate marauding for food or plunder[706], and\r\ngenuine inability to keep up with the regiment on the part of weakly\r\nmen, Moore’s main body accomplished the march from Lugo to Betanzos\r\nin the most disorderly style. Paget’s rearguard kept their ranks, but\r\nthe troops in front were marching in a drove, without any attempt\r\nto preserve discipline. An observer counted one very distinguished\r\nregiment in Manningham’s brigade of Baird’s division, and reports that\r\nwith the colours there were only nine officers, three sergeants, and\r\nthree privates when they reached the gates of Betanzos[707].\r\n\r\n  [706] Outside Betanzos Paget halted, stopped the marauding\r\n  stragglers, and had them stripped of their plunder. Blakeney of\r\n  the 28th saw 1,500 men searched. ‘It is impossible to enumerate\r\n  the different articles of plunder which they had crammed into\r\n  their packs and haversacks--brass candlesticks bent double,\r\n  bundles of common knives, copper saucepans, every kind of\r\n  domestic utensil, without regard to weight or value’ (p. 92).\r\n\r\n  [707] Adam Neale, p. 196. The same battalion could show 500\r\n  bayonets for the battle of Corunna, so the men were not far off,\r\n  as it would seem.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Moore, the French pursued the retreating army with the\r\ngreatest slackness. It was late on the morning of the ninth before\r\nSoult discovered that the British were gone: the drenching rain which\r\nhad so incommoded them had at least screened their retreat. After\r\noccupying Lugo, which was full of dead horses, broken material, and\r\nspoiled provisions, the Marshal pushed on Franceschi’s cavalry in\r\npursuit. But he had lost twelve hours, and Moore was far ahead: only\r\nstragglers were captured on the road, and the British rearguard was\r\nnot sighted till the passage of the Ladra, nearly halfway from Lugo to\r\nBetanzos[708]. This was late in the day, and Paget was not seriously\r\nmolested, though the engineers who accompanied him failed to blow up\r\nthe bridges over the Ladra and the Mendeo, partly because their powder\r\nhad been spoilt by the rain, partly (as it would seem) from unskilful\r\nhandiwork.\r\n\r\n  [708] Le Noble (_Campagne du Maréchal Soult_, p. 24) says that\r\n  Franceschi made a ‘charge’ here and took 500 prisoners. The\r\n  number of prisoners is very probably correct, but it is hardly a\r\n  ‘charge’ when isolated stragglers are picked up. The rearguard\r\n  was never molested, and retired without having to fire a shot.\r\n\r\nThe fatiguing retreat was continued through part of the night of\r\nJanuary 9-10, and on the following morning all the regiments reached\r\nBetanzos, on the sea-coast. The indefatigable Reserve division took up\r\na position on a low range of heights outside the town, to cover the\r\nincoming of the thousands of stragglers who were still to the rear.\r\nFrom this vantage-ground they had the opportunity of witnessing a\r\ncurious incident which few of the narrators of the retreat have failed\r\nto record. Franceschi’s cavalry had resumed the pursuit, and after\r\nsweeping up some hundreds of prisoners from isolated parties, came to\r\nthe village at the foot of the hills where the stragglers had gathered\r\nmost thickly. At the noise of their approach, a good number of the more\r\nable-bodied men ran together, hastily formed up in a solid mass across\r\nthe road, and beat off the French horsemen by a rolling fire. This had\r\nbeen done more by instinct than by design: but a sergeant of the 43rd,\r\nwho assumed command over the assembly, skilfully brought order out of\r\nthe danger[709]. He divided the men into two parties, which retired\r\nalternately down the road, the one facing the French while the other\r\npushed on. The chasseurs charged them several times, but could never\r\nbreak in, and the whole body escaped to the English lines[710]. They\r\nhad covered the retreat of many other stragglers, who ran in from all\r\nsides while the combat was going on. Yet in spite of this irregular\r\nexploit, the army lost many men: on this day and the preceding ninth,\r\nmore than 1000 were left behind--some had died of cold and fatigue,\r\nsome had been cut down by the French. But the majority had been\r\ncaptured as they straggled along, too dazed and worn out even to leave\r\nthe road and take to the hillside when the cavalry got among them[711].\r\n\r\n  [709] This sergeant’s name was William Newman. He was rewarded by\r\n  an ensign’s commission in the 1st West India Regiment.\r\n\r\n  [710] I think that it must be to this combat that one of the\r\n  reminiscences of ‘T.S.’ of the 71st relates, though he is vague\r\n  in his dates. ‘Sleep was stealing over me when I perceived\r\n  a bustle around me. It was an advanced party of the French.\r\n  Unconscious of my action I started to my feet, levelled my\r\n  musket, which I still retained, fired and formed with the other\r\n  stragglers. There were more of them than of us, but the action\r\n  and the approach of danger in a shape which we could repel roused\r\n  our downcast feelings.... While we ran they pursued, the moment\r\n  we faced about they halted. We never fought but with success,\r\n  never were attacked but we forced them to retire’ (p. 60).\r\n\r\n  [711] The stragglers’ battle in front of Betanzos is described by\r\n  Adam Neale (p. 196), Blakeney (pp. 90, 91), and Steevens of the\r\n  20th (p. 70), as well as by Napier and the other historians. I\r\n  find no account of it in Le Noble or the other French narrators,\r\n  such as Naylies, St. Chamans, or Fantin des Odoards. Le Noble\r\n  gives instead a wholly fictitious account of an engagement of\r\n  Franceschi with English _cavalry_, in which the latter lost a\r\n  thousand men and five guns (p. 34). As the cavalry had marched\r\n  for Corunna before Franceschi came up, and lost only about 200\r\n  men in the whole campaign, I am quite at a loss to understand\r\n  what can be the foundation of this romance.\r\n\r\nSoult had as yet no infantry to the front, and Moore remained for a day\r\nat Betanzos, observed by Franceschi’s and Lahoussaye’s cavalry, which\r\ndared not molest him. On January 11 he resumed his march to Corunna,\r\nwith his army in a far better condition than might have been expected.\r\nThe weather had turned mild and dry, and the climate of the coastland\r\nwas a pleasant change from that of the mountains[712]. The men had been\r\nwell fed at Betanzos with food sent on from Corunna, and, marching\r\nalong the friendly sea with their goal in sight, recovered themselves\r\nin a surprising manner. Their general was not so cheerful: he had heard\r\nthat the fleet from Vigo had failed to double Cape Finisterre, and was\r\nstill beating about in the Atlantic. He had hoped to find it already in\r\nharbour, and was much concerned to think that he might have to stand at\r\nbay for some days in order to allow it time to arrive.\r\n\r\n  [712] Fantin des Odoards gives a vivid and picturesque account of\r\n  the relief caused to the pursuers, by the sudden plunge into fine\r\n  spring-like weather, on descending from the snows of the interior\r\n  (p. 198).\r\n\r\nAt Betanzos more sacrifices of war-material were made by the retiring\r\narmy. Moore found there a large quantity of stores intended for La\r\nRomana, and had to spike and throw into the river five guns and some\r\nthousands of muskets. A considerable amount of food was imperfectly\r\ndestroyed, but enough remained to give a welcome supply to the\r\nfamishing French. It had been intended to blow up Betanzos bridge,\r\nbut the mines were only partially successful, and the 28th Regiment\r\nfrom Paget’s Reserve division had to stay behind and to guard the\r\nhalf-ruined structure against Franceschi’s cavalry, till the main body\r\nhad nearly reached Corunna, and the French infantry had begun to appear.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the eleventh, the divisions of Hope, Baird, and Fraser\r\nreached Corunna, while that of Paget halted at El Burgo, four miles\r\noutside the town, where the _chaussée_ crosses the tidal river Mero.\r\nHere the bridge was successfully blown up: it was only the second\r\noperation of the kind which had been carried out with efficiency during\r\nthe whole retreat. Another bridge at Cambria, a few miles further up\r\nthe stream, was also destroyed. Thus the French were for the moment\r\nbrought to a stand. On the twelfth their leading infantry column came\r\nup, and bickered with Paget’s troops, across the impassable water, for\r\nthe whole day[713]. But it was not till the thirteenth that Franceschi\r\ndiscovered a third passage at Celas, seven miles inland, across which\r\nhe conducted his division. Moore then ordered the Reserve to draw back\r\nto the heights in front of Corunna. The French instantly came down to\r\nthe river, and began to reconstruct the broken bridge. On the night of\r\nthe thirteenth infantry could cross: on the fourteenth the artillery\r\nalso began to pass over. But Soult advanced with great caution: here,\r\nas at Lugo, he was dismayed to see how much the fatigues of the march\r\nhad diminished his army: Delaborde’s division was not yet up: those\r\nof Merle and Mermet were so thinned by straggling that the Marshal\r\nresolved not to put his fortune to the test till the ranks were again\r\nfull.\r\n\r\n  [713] There is a good account of the bickering in Blakeney, pp.\r\n  102-5.\r\n\r\nThis delay gave the British general ample time to arrange for his\r\ndeparture. On the thirteenth, he blew up the great stores of powder\r\nwhich the Junta of Galicia had left stowed away in a magazine three\r\nmiles outside the town. The quantity was not much less than 4,000\r\nbarrels, and the explosion was so powerful that wellnigh every window\r\nin Corunna was shattered.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the fourteenth the long-expected transports at\r\nlast ran into the harbour, and Moore began to get on board his sick\r\nand wounded, his cavalry, and his guns. The horses were in such a\r\ndeplorable state that very few of them were worth reshipping: only\r\nabout 250 cavalry chargers and 700 artillery draught-cattle were\r\nconsidered too good to be left behind[714]. The remainder of the poor\r\nbeasts, more than 2,000 in number, were shot or stabbed and flung into\r\nthe sea. Only enough were left to draw nine guns, which the general\r\nintended to use if he was forced to give battle before the embarkation\r\nwas finished. The rest of the cannon, over fifty in number, were safely\r\ngot on board the fleet. The personnel of the cavalry and artillery went\r\non shipboard very little reduced by their casualties in the retreat.\r\nThe former was only short of 200 men, the latter of 250: they had come\r\noff so easily because they had been sent to the rear since Cacabellos,\r\nand had retreated to Corunna without any check or molestation. Along\r\nwith the hussars and the gunners some 2,500 or 3,000 invalids were\r\nsent on board. A few hundred more, too sick to face a voyage, were\r\nleft behind in the hospitals of Corunna. Something like 5,000 men had\r\nperished or been taken during the retreat; 3,500 had embarked at Vigo,\r\nso that about 15,000 men, all infantry save some 200 gunners, remained\r\nbehind to oppose Soult. Considering all that they had gone through,\r\nthey were now in very good trim: all the sick and weakly men had\r\nbeen sent off, those who remained in the ranks were all war-hardened\r\nveterans. Before the battle they had enjoyed four days of rest and\r\ngood feeding in Corunna. Moreover, they had repaired their armament:\r\nthere were in the arsenal many thousand stand of arms, newly arrived\r\nfrom England for the use of the Galician army. Moore made his men\r\nchange their rusty and battered muskets for new ones, before ordering\r\nthe store to be destroyed. He also distributed new cartridges, from an\r\nenormous stock found in the place. The town was, in fact, crammed with\r\nmunitions of all sorts. Seeing that there would be no time to re-embark\r\nthem, Moore utilized what he could, and destroyed the rest.\r\n\r\n  [714] I obtain these figures from the _Parliamentary Returns_ of\r\n  1809.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII: CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF CORUNNA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Sir John Moore found that the transports were not ready on the\r\ntwelfth, he had recognized that he might very probably have to fight\r\na defensive action in order to cover his retreat, for two days would\r\nallow Soult to bring up his main-body. He refused to listen to the\r\ntimid proposal of certain of his officers that he should negotiate\r\nfor a quiet embarkation, in return for giving up Corunna and its\r\nfortifications unharmed[715]. This would have been indeed a tame line\r\nof conduct for a general and an army which had never been beaten in the\r\nfield. Instead he sought for a good position in which to hold back the\r\nenemy till all his impedimenta were on shipboard. There were no less\r\nthan three lines of heights on which the army might range itself to\r\nresist an enemy who had crossed the Mero. But the first two ranges, the\r\nMonte Loureiro just above the river, and the plateaux of Palavea and\r\nPeñasquedo two miles further north, were too extensive to be held by\r\nan army of 15,000 men. Moore accordingly chose as his fighting-ground\r\nthe Monte Moro, a shorter and lower ridge, only two miles outside\r\nthe walls of Corunna. It is an excellent position, about 2,500 yards\r\nlong, but has two defects: its western and lower end is commanded at\r\nlong cannon-range by the heights of Peñasquedo. Moreover, beyond this\r\nextreme point of the hill, there is open ground extending as far as\r\nthe gates of Corunna, by which the whole position can be turned. Fully\r\naware of this fact, Moore told off more than a third of his army to\r\nserve as a flank-guard on this wing, and to prevent the enemy from\r\npushing in between the Monte Moro and the narrow neck of the peninsula\r\non which Corunna stands.\r\n\r\n  [715] There can be no doubt that this strange suggestion was\r\n  made, as Moore himself mentions it in his dispatch of Jan. 13,\r\n  the last which he wrote.\r\n\r\nSoult, even after he had passed the Mero and repaired the bridges, was\r\nvery circumspect in his advances. He had too much respect for the\r\nfighting power of the English army to attack before he had rallied his\r\nwhole force. When Delaborde’s division and a multitude of stragglers\r\nhad joined him on the fifteenth, he at last moved forward and seized\r\nthe heights of Palavea and Peñasquedo, overlooking the British\r\nposition. There was some slight skirmishing with the outposts which had\r\nbeen left on these positions, and when the French brought down two guns\r\nto the lower slopes by Palavea, and began to cannonade the opposite\r\nhill, Colonel McKenzie, of the 5th Regiment, made an attempt to drive\r\nthem off, which failed with loss, and cost him his life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Battle of Corunna. January 16, 1809.]\r\n\r\nAs the French pressed westward along these commanding heights, Moore\r\nsaw that he might very possibly be attacked on the following day, and\r\nbrought up his troops to their fighting-ground, though he was still\r\nnot certain that Soult would risk a battle. The divisions of Hope and\r\nBaird were ranged along the upper slopes of the Monte Moro: the ten\r\nbattalions of the former on the eastern half of the ridge, nearest\r\nthe river, the eight battalions of the latter on its western half,\r\nmore towards the inland. Each division had two brigades in the first\r\nline and a third in reserve. Counting from left to right, the brigades\r\nwere those of Hill and Leith from Hope’s division, and Manningham and\r\nBentinck from Baird’s. Behind the crest Catlin Crawfurd supported the\r\ntwo former, and Warde’s battalions of Guards the two latter. Down in\r\nthe hollow behind the Monte Moro lay Paget’s division, close to the\r\nvillage of Eiris[716]. He was invisible to the French, but so placed\r\nthat he could immediately move out to cover the right wing if the enemy\r\nattempted a turning movement. Lastly, Fraser’s division lay under cover\r\nin Corunna, ready to march forth to support Paget the moment that\r\nfighting should begin[717]. Six of the nine guns (small six-pounders),\r\nwhich Moore had left on shore, were distributed in pairs along the\r\nfront of Monte Moro: the other three were with Paget’s reserve.\r\n\r\n  [716] Paget had just lost his senior brigadier, Anstruther, who\r\n  died of dysentery in Corunna that day. His second brigade was\r\n  commanded by Disney.\r\n\r\n  [717] His two brigadiers were Beresford and Fane.\r\n\r\nAfter surveying the British position from the Peñasquedo heights, Soult\r\nhad resolved to attempt the manœuvre which Moore had thought most\r\nprobable--to assault the western end of the line, where the heights are\r\nleast formidable, and at the same moment to turn the Monte Moro by a\r\nmovement round its extreme right through the open ground. Nor had it\r\nescaped him that the ground occupied by Baird’s division was within\r\ncannon-shot of the opposite range. He ordered ten guns to be dragged\r\nup to the westernmost crest of the French position, and to be placed\r\nabove the village of Elvina, facing Bentinck’s brigade. The rest of\r\nhis artillery was distributed along the front of the Peñasquedo and\r\nPalavea heights, in situations that were less favourable, because they\r\nwere more remote from the British lines. The hills were steep, no road\r\nran along their summit, and the guns had to be dragged by hand to the\r\nplaces which they were intended to occupy. It was only under cover\r\nof the night that those opposite Elvina were finally got to their\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nSoult’s force was now considerably superior to that which was opposed\r\nto him, sufficiently so in his own estimation to compensate for the\r\nstrength of the defensive positions which he would have to assail. He\r\nhad three infantry divisions with thirty-nine battalions (Heudelet\r\nwas still far to the rear), and twelve regiments of cavalry, with\r\nabout forty guns[718]. The whole, even allowing for stragglers still\r\ntrailing in the rear, and for men who had perished in the snows of the\r\nmountains, must have been over 20,000 strong. The cavalry had 4,500\r\nsabres, and the infantry battalions must still have averaged over 500\r\nmen, for in November they had nearly all been up to 700 bayonets, and\r\neven the toilsome march in pursuit of Moore cannot have destroyed so\r\nmuch as a third of their numbers: only Merle’s division had done any\r\nfighting. It is absurd of some of the French narrators of the battle to\r\npretend that Soult had only 13,000 infantry--a figure which would only\r\ngive 330 bayonets to each battalion[719].\r\n\r\n  [718] The force stood as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Infantry--1st Division, Merle (Brigades Reynaud, Sarrut, Thomières).\r\n                                    }   Each of Merle’s regiments (of which\r\n    2nd Léger (three batts.)        } three were originally two battalions\r\n    4th Léger (four batts.)         } and one three battalions strong) had\r\n    15th of the Line (three batts.) } received an additional battalion from\r\n    36th of the Line (three batts.) } the dissolved corps of Junot, before\r\n                                    } leaving Astorga.\r\n\r\n  2nd Division, Mermet (Brigades Gaulois, Jardon, Lefebvre).\r\n                                    }   The 47th had received two, and the\r\n    31st Léger (four batts.)        } 31st Léger and 2nd Swiss each one\r\n    47th of the Line (four batts.)  } battalion from Junot’s corps. The\r\n    122nd of the Line (four batts.) } 122nd was a new regiment,\r\n    2nd Swiss Regiment (two batts.) } consolidated from six battalions of\r\n    3rd Swiss Regiment (one batt.)  } the ‘Supplementary Legions of\r\n                                    } Reserve.’\r\n\r\n  3rd Division, Delaborde (Brigades Foy and Arnaud).\r\n                                    }  The 70th and 86th, from Portugal,\r\n    17th Léger (three batts.)       } had each received a battalion from\r\n    70th of the Line (four batts.)  } Merle’s division, where they had been\r\n    86th of the Line (three batts.) } serving in the autumn. The 17th\r\n    4th Swiss Regiment (one batt.)  } Léger had been transferred from the\r\n                                    } 6th Corps to the 2nd.\r\n\r\n  Cavalry--Lahoussaye’s Division of Dragoons (Brigades Marisy and\r\n    Caulaincourt).\r\n      17th, 18th, 19th, and 27th Dragoons--four regiments.\r\n\r\n  Lorges’s Division of Dragoons (Brigades Vialannes and Fournier).\r\n    13th, 15th, 22nd, and 25th Dragoons--four regiments.\r\n\r\n  Franceschi’s Mixed Division (Brigades Debelle and Girardin [?]).\r\n    1st Hussars, 8th Dragoons, 22nd Chasseurs, and Hanoverian\r\n      Chasseurs--four regiments.\r\n\r\n  Artillery--600 men (?): exact figures not available.\r\n\r\n  [719] e.g. Le Noble in his _Campagne du Maréchal Soult_, 1808-9,\r\n  p. 41.\r\n\r\nSoult’s plan was to contain the British left and centre with two of his\r\ndivisions--those of Delaborde and Merle--while Mermet and the bulk of\r\nthe cavalry should attack Moore’s right, seize the western end of Monte\r\nMoro, and push in between Baird’s flank and Corunna. If this movement\r\nsucceeded, the British retreat would be compromised: Delaborde and\r\nMerle could then assail Hope and prevent him from going to the rear: if\r\nall went right, two-thirds of the British army must be surrounded and\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\nThe movement of masses of infantry, and still more of cavalry and\r\nguns, along the rugged crest and slopes of the Peñasquedo heights, was\r\nattended with so much difficulty, that noon was long passed before the\r\nwhole army was in position. It was indeed so late in the day, that\r\nSir John Moore had come to the conclusion that Soult did not intend\r\nto attack, and had ordered Paget’s division, who were to be the first\r\ntroops to embark, to march down to the harbour[720]. The other corps\r\nwere to retire at dusk, and go on shipboard under cover of the night.\r\n\r\n  [720] Blakeney, p. 114.\r\n\r\nBut between 1.30 and 2 o’clock the French suddenly took the offensive:\r\nthe battery opposite Elvina began to play upon Baird’s division,\r\ncolumns descending from each side of it commenced to pour down into the\r\nvalley, and the eight cavalry regiments of Lahoussaye and Franceschi,\r\npushing out from behind the Peñasquedo heights, rode northward along\r\nthe lower slopes of the hills of San Cristobal, with the obvious design\r\nof cutting in between the Monte Moro and Corunna.\r\n\r\nMoore welcomed the approach of battle with joy: he had every confidence\r\nin his men and his position, and saw that a victory won ere his\r\ndeparture would silence the greater part of the inevitable criticism\r\nfor timidity and want of enterprise, to which he would be exposed\r\non his return to England. He rode up to the crest of his position,\r\nbehind Baird’s division, took in the situation of affairs at a glance,\r\nand sent back orders to Paget to pay attention to the French turning\r\nmovement, and to Fraser to come out from Corunna and contain any\r\nadvance on the part of the enemy’s cavalry on the extreme right.\r\n\r\nFor some time the English left and centre were scarcely engaged, for\r\nMerle and Delaborde did no more than push tirailleurs out in front\r\nof their line, to bicker with the skirmishers of Hill, Leith, and\r\nManningham. But Bentinck’s brigade was at once seriously assailed: not\r\nonly were its lines swept by the balls of Soult’s main battery, but a\r\nheavy infantry attack was in progress. Gaulois and Jardon’s brigades of\r\nMermet’s division were coming forward in great strength: they turned\r\nout of the village of Elvina the light company of the 50th, which had\r\nbeen detached to hold that advanced position, and then came up the\r\nslope of Monte Moro, with a dense crowd of tirailleurs covering the\r\nadvance of eight battalion columns. Meanwhile the third brigade of\r\nMermet’s division was hurrying past the flank of Bentinck’s line, in\r\nthe lower ground, with the obvious intention of turning the British\r\nflank. Beyond them Lahoussaye’s dragoons were cautiously feeling their\r\nway forward, much incommoded by walls and broken ground.\r\n\r\nAll the stress of the first fighting fell on the three battalions of\r\nBentinck, on the hill above Elvina. Moore was there in person to direct\r\nthe fight: Baird, on whom the responsibility for this part of the\r\nground would naturally have fallen, was wounded early in the day, by\r\na cannon-ball which shattered his left arm[721], and was borne to the\r\nrear. When the French came near the top of the slope, driving in before\r\nthem the British skirmishing line, the Commander-in-chief ordered the\r\n42nd and 50th to charge down upon them. The 4th, the flank regiment\r\nof the whole line, could not follow them: it was threatened by the\r\nencircling movement of the French left, and Moore bade it throw back\r\nits right wing so as to form an angle _en potence_ with the rest of the\r\nbrigade, while still keeping up its fire. The manœuvre was executed\r\nwith such precision as to win his outspoken approval--‘That is exactly\r\nhow it should be done,’ he shouted to Colonel Wynch, and then rode off\r\nto attend to the 50th and 42nd, further to his left.\r\n\r\n  [721] His dispatch to Castlereagh, of Jan. 18, proves that he was\r\n  wounded before Moore fell.\r\n\r\nHere a very heavy combat was raging. Advancing to meet the French\r\nattack, these two battalions drove in the tirailleurs with the\r\ncrushing fire of their two-deep line, and then became engaged with the\r\nsupporting columns on the slopes above Elvina. For some time the battle\r\nstood still, but Moore told the regiments that they must advance to\r\nmake their fire tell, and at last Colonel Sterling and Major Charles\r\nNapier led their men over the line of stone walls behind which they\r\nwere standing, and pressed forward. The head of the French formation\r\nmelted away before their volleys, and the enemy rolled back into\r\nElvina. The 42nd halted just above the village, but Napier led the\r\n50th in among the houses, and cleared out the defenders after a sharp\r\nfight. He even passed through with part of his men, and became engaged\r\nwith the French supports on the further side of the place. Presently\r\nMermet sent down his reserves and drove out the 50th, who suffered very\r\nheavily: Charles Napier was wounded and taken, and Stanhope the junior\r\nmajor was killed[722]. While the 50th was reforming, Moore brought up\r\nthe divisional reserve, Warde’s two magnificent battalions of Guards,\r\neach of which, in consequence of their splendid discipline during the\r\nretreat, mustered over 800 bayonets. With these and the 42nd he held\r\nthe slope above Elvina in face of a very hot fire, not only from the\r\nenemy’s infantry but from the battery on the opposite heights, which\r\nswept the ground with a lateral and almost an enfilading fire. It was\r\nwhile directing one of the Guards’ battalions to go forward and storm\r\na large house on the flank of the village that Moore received a mortal\r\nwound. A cannon-ball struck him on the left shoulder, carrying it away\r\nwith part of the collar-bone, and leaving the arm hanging only by\r\nthe flesh and muscles above the armpit[723]. He was dashed from his\r\nhorse, but immediately raised himself on his sound arm and bade his\r\naide-de-camp Hardinge see that the 42nd should advance along with the\r\nGuards. Then he was borne to the rear, fully realizing that his wound\r\nwas mortal: his consciousness never failed, in spite of the pain and\r\nthe loss of blood, and he found strength to send a message to Hope to\r\nbid him take command of the army. When his bearers wished to unbuckle\r\nhis sword, which was jarring his wounded arm and side, he refused to\r\nallow it, saying ‘in his usual tone and with a very distinct voice,\r\n“It is well as it is. I had rather that it should go out of the field\r\nwith me.”’ He was borne back to Corunna in a blanket by six men of the\r\nGuards and 42nd. Frequently he made them turn him round to view the\r\nfield of battle, and as he saw the French line of fire rolling back, he\r\nseveral times expressed his pleasure at dying in the moment of victory,\r\nwhen his much-tried army was at last faring as it deserved.\r\n\r\n  [722] Every student of the Peninsular War should read Charles\r\n  Napier’s vivid and thrilling account of the storm of Elvina.\r\n  William Napier reprinted it in vol. i of his brother’s biography.\r\n  Charles was within an ace of being murdered after surrender, and\r\n  was saved by a gallant French drummer.\r\n\r\n  [723] Letter of his aide-de-camp Hardinge in James Moore’s\r\n  _Life_, p. 220.\r\n\r\nWhile Bentinck’s brigade and the Guards were thus engaged with Mermet’s\r\nright, a separate combat was going on more to the west, where Edward\r\nPaget and the Reserve division had marched out to resist the French\r\nturning movement. The instant that Moore’s first orders had been\r\nreceived, Paget had sent forward the 95th Rifles in extended order to\r\ncover the gap, half a mile in breadth, between the Monte Moro and the\r\nheights of San Cristobal. Soon afterwards he pushed up the 52nd into\r\nline with the riflemen. The other three battalions of the division\r\nmoved out soon after. Paget had in front of him a brigade--five\r\nbattalions--of Mermet’s division, which was trying to slip round the\r\ncorner of Monte Moro in order to take Baird in the flank. He had also\r\nto guard against the charges of Lahoussaye’s cavalry more to his right,\r\nand those of Franceschi’s chasseurs still further south. Fortunately\r\nthe ground was so much cut up with rough stone walls, dividing the\r\nfields of the villages of San Cristobal and Elvina, that Soult’s\r\ncavalry were unable to execute any general or vigorous advance. When\r\nthe British swept across the low ground, Lahoussaye’s dragoons made two\r\nor three attempts to charge, but, forced to advance among walls and\r\nravines, they never even compelled Paget’s battalions to form square,\r\nand were easily driven off by a rolling fire. The Reserve division\r\nsteadily advanced, with the 95th and 52nd in its front, and the\r\nhorsemen gave back. It was in vain that Lahoussaye dismounted the 27th\r\nDragoons and ranged them as _tirailleurs_ along the lower slopes of the\r\nheights of San Cristobal. The deadly fire of Paget’s infantry thinned\r\ntheir ranks, and forced them back. It would seem that the 95th, 28th,\r\nand 91st had mainly to do with Lahoussaye, while the 52nd and 20th\r\nbecame engaged with the infantry from the division of Mermet, which was\r\nbickering with the 4th Regiment below the Monte Moro, and striving to\r\nturn its flank. In both quarters the advance was completely successful,\r\nand Paget pushed forward, taking numerous prisoners from the enemy’s\r\nbroken infantry. So far did he advance in his victorious onslaught that\r\nhe approached from the flank the main French battery on the heights of\r\nPeñasquedo, and thought that (if leave had been given him) he would\r\nhave been able to capture it: for its infantry supports were broken,\r\nand the cavalry had gone off far to the right. But Hope sent no orders\r\nto his colleague, and the Reserve halted at dusk at the foot of the\r\nFrench position.\r\n\r\nFranceschi’s horsemen meanwhile, on the extreme left of the French\r\nline, had at first pushed cautiously towards Corunna, till they saw\r\nFraser’s division drawn up half a mile outside the gates, on the low\r\nridge of Santa Margarita, covering the whole neck of the peninsula.\r\nThis checked the cavalry, and presently, when Paget’s advance drove\r\nin Lahoussaye, Franceschi conformed to the retreat of his colleague,\r\nand drew back across the heights of San Cristobal till he had reached\r\nthe left rear of Soult’s position, and halted in the upland valley\r\nsomewhere near the village of Mesoiro.\r\n\r\nWe left Bentinck’s and Warde’s brigades engaged on the slopes above\r\nElvina with Mermet’s right-hand column, at the moment of the fall of\r\nSir John Moore. The second advance on Elvina had begun just as the\r\nBritish commander-in-chief fell: it was completely successful, and the\r\nvillage was for the second time captured. Mermet now sent down his last\r\nreserves, and Merle moved forward his left-hand brigade to attack the\r\nvillage on its eastern side. This led to a corresponding movement on\r\nthe part of the British. Manningham’s brigade from the right-centre of\r\nthe British line came down the slope, and fell upon Merle’s columns as\r\nthey pressed in towards the village. This forced the French to halt,\r\nand to turn aside to defend themselves: there was a long and fierce\r\nstrife, during the later hours of the afternoon, between Manningham’s\r\ntwo right-hand regiments (the 3/1st and 2/81st) and the 2nd Léger and\r\n36th of the Line of Reynaud’s brigade. It was prolonged till the\r\n2/81st had exhausted all its ammunition, and had suffered a loss of 150\r\nmen, when Hope sent down the 2/59th, the reserve regiment of Leith’s\r\nbrigade, to relieve it. Soon afterwards the French retired, and the\r\nbattle died away at dusk into mere distant bickering along the bottom\r\nof the valley, as a few skirmishers of the victorious brigade pursued\r\nthe retreating columns to the foot of their position.\r\n\r\nFurther eastward Delaborde had done nothing more than make a feeble\r\ndemonstration against Hope’s very strong position on the heights above\r\nthe Mero river. He drove in Hill’s pickets, and afterwards, late in\r\nthe afternoon, endeavoured to seize the village of Piedralonga[724],\r\nat the bottom of the valley which lay between the hostile lines. Foy,\r\nwho was entrusted with this operation, took the voltigeur companies of\r\nhis brigade, and drove out from the hamlet the outposts of the 14th\r\nRegiment. Thereupon Hill sent down Colonel Nicholls with three more\r\ncompanies of that corps, supported by two of the 92nd from Hope’s\r\ndivisional reserve. They expelled the French, and broke the supports on\r\nwhich the voltigeurs tried to rally, taking a few prisoners including\r\nFoy’s brigade-major. Delaborde then sent down another battalion,\r\nwhich recovered the southern end of the village, while Nicholls held\r\ntightly to the rest of it. At dusk both parties ceased to push on,\r\nand the firing died away. The engagement at this end of the line was\r\ninsignificant: Foy lost eighteen killed and fifty wounded from the 70th\r\nof the Line, and a few more from the 86th. Nicholls’s casualties were\r\nprobably even smaller[725].\r\n\r\n  [724] Erroneously called in most British and French accounts\r\n  Palavea Abaxo. The latter village is at the foot of the French\r\n  line, a little to the north.\r\n\r\n  [725] For an account of this combat from the French side see\r\n  Foy’s report to Delaborde, printed in Girod de l’Ain’s _Vie\r\n  militaire du Général Foy_ (appendix), where the losses of the\r\n  brigade are given. On the English side the 92nd lost three killed\r\n  and five wounded (see Gardyne’s _History of the 92nd Regiment_).\r\n  The 14th do not separate their battle-losses from those of the\r\n  retreat in their casualty-returns. They had sixty-six dead and\r\n  missing in the whole campaign, and put on board at Corunna\r\n  seventy-two sick and wounded. Probably not more than ten of\r\n  the former and thirty of the latter were hit in the battle; if\r\n  the casualties were any larger on January 16 the losses in the\r\n  retreat must have been abnormally small in the 14th Regiment.\r\n\r\nSoult had suffered such a decided reverse that he had no desire to\r\nprolong the battle, while Hope--who so unexpectedly found himself in\r\ncommand of the British army--showed no wish to make a counter-attack,\r\nand was quite contented to have vindicated his position. He claimed,\r\nin his dispatch, that at the end of the engagement the army was\r\nholding a more advanced line than at its commencement: and this was\r\nin part true, for Elvina was now occupied in force, and not merely\r\nby a picket, and Paget on the right had cleared the ground below the\r\nheights of San Cristobal, which Lahoussaye had been occupying during\r\nthe action. Some of the French writers have claimed that Soult also\r\nhad gained ground[726]: but the only fact that can be cited in favour\r\nof their contention is that Foy was holding on to the southern end of\r\nPiedralonga[727]. All the eye-witnesses on their side concede that\r\nat the end of the action the marshal’s army had fallen back to its\r\noriginal position[728].\r\n\r\n  [726] Of course the untrustworthy Le Noble does so, and falsifies\r\n  his map accordingly.\r\n\r\n  [727] Foy’s brigade engaged two battalions of the 70th Regiment,\r\n  besides three companies of _voltigeurs_ of the 86th; this was all\r\n  that Delaborde sent forward. There were two _chefs de bataillon_\r\n  among the wounded.\r\n\r\n  [728] ‘Chaque armée resta sur son terrain,’ says St. Chamans,\r\n  Soult’s senior aide-de-camp (the man who so kindly entreated\r\n  Charles Napier, as the latter’s memoirs show). ‘A la nuit, qui\r\n  seule a pu terminer cette lutte opiniâtre, nous nous sommes\r\n  retrouvés au point d’où nous étions partis à 3 heures,’ says\r\n  Fantin des Odoards, of Mermet’s division (p. 200). ‘Nos troupes\r\n  furent obligées, par des forces supérieures, de rentrer dans\r\n  leurs premiers postes,’ says Naylies, of Lahoussaye’s dragoons\r\n  (p. 46).\r\n\r\nEnglish critics have occasionally suggested that the success won by\r\nPaget and Bentinck might have been pressed, and that if the division\r\nof Fraser had been brought up to their support, the French left might\r\nhave been turned and crushed[729]. But considering that Soult had\r\nfourteen or fifteen intact battalions left, in the divisions of Merle\r\nand Delaborde[730], it would have been well in his power to fight a\r\nsuccessful defensive action on his heights, throwing back his left\r\nwing, so as to keep it from being encircled. Hope was right to be\r\ncontented with his success: even if he had won a victory he could have\r\ndone no more than re-embark, for the army was not in a condition to\r\nplunge once more into the Galician highlands in pursuit of Soult, who\r\nwould have been joined in a few days by Heudelet, and in a week by Ney.\r\n\r\n  [729] Blakeney urges this very strongly (pp. 117, 118); Graham\r\n  also.\r\n\r\n  [730] It would seem that only the 2nd Léger and 36th of the Line\r\n  of Merle, and the 70th of Delaborde, had been seriously engaged.\r\n\r\nThe losses suffered by the two armies at the battle of Corunna are not\r\neasy to estimate. The British regiments, embarking on the day after\r\nthe fight, did not send in any returns of their casualties till they\r\nreached England. Then, most unfortunately, a majority of the colonels\r\nlumped together the losses of the retreat and those of the battle.\r\nIt is lucky, however, to find that among the regiments which sent in\r\nproper returns are nearly all those which fought the brunt of the\r\naction. The 50th and 42nd of Bentinck’s brigade were by far the most\r\nheavily tried, from the prolonged and desperate fighting in and about\r\nElvina. The former lost two officers killed and three wounded, with\r\n180 rank and file: the Highland battalion thirty-nine rank and file\r\nkilled and 111 (including six officers) wounded. The Guards’ brigade,\r\non the other hand, which was brought up to support these regiments,\r\nsuffered very little; the first battalion of the 1st Regiment had\r\nonly five, the second only eight killed, with about forty wounded\r\nbetween them. In Manningham’s brigade the 81st, with its loss of three\r\nofficers and twenty-seven men killed, and eleven officers and 112 men\r\nwounded, was by far the heaviest sufferer: the Royals may also have\r\nhad a considerable casualty-list, but its figures are apparently not\r\nto be found, except confused with those of the whole retreat. Paget’s\r\ndivision in its flank march to ward off the French turning movement\r\nsuffered surprisingly little: of its two leading regiments the 1/95th\r\nhad but twelve killed and thirty-three wounded, the 1/52nd five killed\r\nand thirty-three wounded. The other three battalions, which formed the\r\nsupports, must have had even fewer men disabled. Hope’s division, with\r\nthe exception of the 14th and the 59th, was not seriously engaged: the\r\nfew battalions which sent in their battle-losses, apart from those of\r\nthe retreat, show figures such as six or ten for their casualties on\r\nJanuary 16. Fraser’s whole division neither fired a shot nor lost a\r\nman. It is probable then that Hope, when in his dispatch he estimated\r\nthe total loss of the British army at ‘something between 700 and 800,’\r\nwas overstating rather than understating the total.\r\n\r\nSoult’s losses are even harder to discover than those of Moore’s army.\r\nHis chronicler, Le Noble[731], says that they amounted to no more\r\nthan 150 killed and 500 wounded. The ever inaccurate Thiers reduces\r\nthis figure to 400 or less. On the other hand Naylies, a combatant in\r\nthe battle, speaks of 800 casualties; and Marshal Jourdan, in his\r\n_précis_ of the campaign, gives 1,000[732]. But all these figures\r\nmust be far below the truth. Fantin des Odoards has preserved the\r\nexact loss of his own corps, the 31st Léger, one of the regiments of\r\nMermet’s division, which fought in Elvina. It amounted to no less\r\nthan 330 men[733]. The other four regiments of the division were not\r\nless deeply engaged, and it is probable that Mermet alone must have\r\nlost over 1,000 in killed and wounded. Two of his three brigadiers\r\nwent down in the fight: Gaulois was shot dead, Lefebvre badly hurt.\r\nOf Merle’s division, one brigade was hotly engaged in the struggle\r\nwith Manningham’s battalions, in which our 2/81st lost so heavily.\r\nThe French cannot have suffered less, as they were the beaten party.\r\nLahoussaye’s dragoons must also have sustained appreciable loss: that\r\nof Delaborde (as we have already seen) was limited to about eighteen\r\nkilled and fifty wounded. Of unwounded prisoners the British took seven\r\nofficers and 156 men. If we put the total of Soult’s casualties at\r\n1,500, we probably shall not be far wrong. All the later experience of\r\nthe war showed that, when French troops delivered in column an uphill\r\nattack on a British position and failed, they suffered twice or thrice\r\nthe loss of the defenders: we need only mention Vimiero and Busaco.\r\nOn this occasion there was the additional advantage that Moore’s army\r\nhad new muskets and good ammunition, while those of Soult’s corps\r\nwere much deteriorated. A loss of 1,500 men therefore seems a fair\r\nand rational estimate. The impression left by the battle on Soult’s\r\nmind was such that, in his first dispatch to the Emperor, he wrote\r\nthat he could do no more against the English till he should have\r\nreceived large reinforcements[734]. But two days later, when Hope had\r\nevacuated Corunna, he changed his tone and let it be understood that\r\nhe had gained ground during the battle, and had so far established\r\nan advantage that his position forced the English to embark. This\r\nallegation was wholly without foundation. Hope simply carried out the\r\narrangements which Moore had made for sending off the army to England,\r\nand his resolve was dictated by the condition of his troops, who\r\nurgently needed reorganization and repose, and not by any fear of what\r\nthe Marshal could do against him.\r\n\r\n  [731] Belmas gives the same number, probably copying Le Noble.\r\n\r\n  [732] Jourdan’s _Mémoires_, p. 126.\r\n\r\n  [733] Fantin des Odoards, p. 201.\r\n\r\n  [734] See Marshal Jourdan’s very judicious remark on Soult’s\r\n  bulletins in his _Mémoires militaires_ (p. 127). ‘His first\r\n  dispatch was not that of a general who imagined that he had been\r\n  successful.’\r\n\r\nMoore, borne back to his quarters in Corunna, survived long enough to\r\nrealize that his army had completely beaten off Soult’s attack, and had\r\nsecured for itself a safe departure. In spite of his dreadful wound he\r\nretained his consciousness to the last. Forgetful of his own pain, he\r\nmade inquiries as to the fate of his especial friends and dependants,\r\nand found strength to dictate several messages, recommending for\r\npromotion officers who had distinguished themselves, and sending\r\nfarewell greetings to his family. He repeatedly said that he was dying\r\nin the way he had always desired, on the night of a victorious battle.\r\nThe only weight on his mind was the thought that public opinion at\r\nhome might bear hardly upon him, in consequence of the horrors of the\r\nretreat. ‘I hope the people of England will be satisfied,’ he gasped;\r\n‘I hope my country will do me justice.’ And then his memory wandered\r\nback to those whom he loved: he tried in vain to frame a message to\r\nhis mother, but weakness and emotion overcame him, and a few minutes\r\nlater he died, with the name of Pitt’s niece (Lady Hester Stanhope)\r\non his lips. Moore had expressed a wish to be buried where he fell,\r\nand his staff carried out his desire as far as was possible, by laying\r\nhim in a grave on the ramparts of Corunna. He was buried at early dawn\r\non the seventeenth, on the central bastion that looks out towards the\r\nland-side and the battle-field. Hard by him lies General Anstruther,\r\nwho had died of dysentery on the day before the fight. Soult, with a\r\ngenerosity that does him much credit, took care of Moore’s grave, and\r\nordered a monument to be erected over the spot where he fell[735]. La\r\nRomana afterwards carried out the Marshal’s pious intentions.\r\n\r\n  [735] The inscription was to run: ‘Hic cecidit Iohannes Moore dux\r\n  exercitus Britannici, in pugna Ianuarii xvi, 1809, contra Gallos\r\n  a duce Dalmatiae ductos.’\r\n\r\nLittle remains to be said about the embarkation of the army. At\r\nnine o’clock on the night of the battle the troops were withdrawn\r\nfrom the Monte Moro position, leaving only pickets along its front.\r\nMany regiments were embarked that night, more on the morning of\r\nthe seventeenth. By the evening of that day all were aboard save\r\nBeresford’s brigade of Fraser’s division, which remained to cover the\r\nembarkation of the rest.\r\n\r\nSoult, when he found that the British had withdrawn, sent up some\r\nfield-pieces to the heights above Fort San Diego, on the southern end\r\nof the bay. Their fire could reach the more outlying transports, and\r\ncreated some confusion, as the masters hastily weighed anchor and\r\nstood out to sea. Four vessels ran on shore, and three of them could\r\nnot be got off: the troops on board were hastily transferred to other\r\nships, with no appreciable loss: from the whole army only nine men of\r\nthe Royal Wagon Train are returned as having been ‘drowned in Corunna\r\nharbour,’ no doubt from the sinking of the boat which was transhipping\r\nthem. General Leith records, in his diary, that on the vessel which\r\ntook him home there were fragments of no less than six regiments: we\r\ncan hardly doubt that this must have been one of those which picked up\r\nthe men from the stranded transports.\r\n\r\nBeresford’s brigade embarked from a safe point behind the citadel\r\non the eighteenth, leaving the town in charge of the small Spanish\r\ngarrison under General Alcedo, which maintained the works till all the\r\nfleet were far out to sea, and then rather tamely surrendered. This was\r\nentirely the doing of their commander, a shifty old man, who almost\r\nimmediately after took service with King Joseph[736].\r\n\r\n  [736] St. Chamans calls him ‘un vieux faible et sans moyens, mené\r\n  par une espèce de courtisane.’ Mr. Stuart (in a note to Vaughan)\r\n  describes him as an ‘unscrupulous old rascal.’\r\n\r\nThe returning fleet had a tempestuous but rapid passage: urged on by a\r\nraging south-wester the vessels ran home in four or five days, and made\r\nalmost every harbour between Falmouth and Dover. Many transports had a\r\ndangerous passage, but only two, the _Dispatch_ and the _Smallbridge_,\r\ncame to grief off the Cornish coast and were lost, the former with\r\nthree officers and fifty-six men of the 7th Hussars, the latter with\r\nfive officers and 209 men of the King’s German Legion[737]. So ended\r\nthe famous ‘Retreat from Sahagun.’\r\n\r\n  [737] Cf. for their losses the _Parliamentary Papers for 1809_\r\n  (pp. 8, 9), and Beamish’s _History of the German Legion_.\r\n\r\nMoore’s memory met, as he had feared, with many unjust aspersions when\r\nthe results of his campaign were known in England. The aspect of the\r\n26,000 ragged war-worn troops, who came ashore on the South Coast,\r\nwas so miserable that those who saw them were shocked. The state of\r\nthe mass of 3,000 invalids, racked with fever and dysentery, who were\r\ncast into the hospitals was eminently distressing. It is seldom that\r\na nation sees its troops returning straight from the field, with the\r\ngrime and sweat of battle and march fresh upon them. The impression\r\nmade was a very unhappy one, and it was easy to blame the General.\r\nPublic discontent was roused both against Moore and against the\r\nministry, and some of the defenders of the latter took an ungenerous\r\nopportunity of shifting all the blame upon the man who could no longer\r\nvindicate himself. This provoked his numerous friends into asserting\r\nthat his whole conduct of the campaign had been absolutely blameless,\r\nand that any misfortunes which occurred were simply and solely the\r\nfault of maladministration and unwise councils at home. Moore was the\r\nhero of the Whig party, and politics were dragged into the discussion\r\nof the campaign to a lamentable extent. Long years after his death the\r\nattitude of the critic or the historian, who dealt with the Corunna\r\nretreat, was invariably coloured by his Whig or Tory predilections.\r\n\r\nThe accepted view of the present generation is (though most men\r\nare entirely unacquainted with the fact) strongly coloured by the\r\ncircumstance that William Napier, whose eloquent history has superseded\r\nall other narratives of the Peninsular War, was a violent enemy of\r\nthe Tory ministry and a personal admirer of Moore. Ninety years and\r\nmore have now passed since the great retreat, and we can look upon the\r\ncampaign with impartial eyes. It is easy to point out mistakes made by\r\nthe home government, such as the tardy dispatch of Baird’s cavalry,\r\nand the inadequate provision of money, both for the division which\r\nstarted from Lisbon and for that which started from Corunna. But these\r\nare not the most important causes of the misfortunes of the campaign.\r\nNor can it be pleaded that the ministry did not support Moore loyally,\r\nor that they tied his hands by contradictory or over-explicit orders.\r\nA glance at Castlereagh’s dispatches is sufficient to show that he\r\nand his colleagues left everything that was possible to be settled by\r\nthe General, and that they approved each of his determinations as it\r\nreached them without any cavilling or criticism[738].\r\n\r\n  [738] In fairness to the government Castlereagh’s dispatches,\r\n  92-105 in the _Parliamentary Papers for 1809_, should be\r\n  carefully studied.\r\n\r\nMoore must take the main responsibility for all that happened. On\r\nthe whole, the impression left after a study of his campaign is\r\nvery favourable to him. His main conception when he marched from\r\nSalamanca--that of gaining time for the rallying of the Spanish\r\narmies, by directing a sudden raid upon the Emperor’s communications\r\nin Castile--was as sound as it was enterprising. The French critics\r\nwho have charged him with rashness have never read his dispatches,\r\nnor realized the care with which he had thought out the retreat, which\r\nhe knew would be inevitable when his movement became known at Madrid.\r\nHe was never for a moment in any serious danger of being surrounded by\r\nthe Emperor, because he was proceeding (as he himself wrote) ‘bridle in\r\nhand,’ and with a full knowledge that he must ‘have a run for it’ on\r\nthe first receipt of news that Napoleon was upon the march. His plan\r\nof making a diversion was a complete success: he drew the Emperor,\r\nwith the 70,000 men who would otherwise have marched on Lisbon, up\r\ninto the north-west of the Peninsula, quite out of the main centre\r\nof operations. Napoleon himself halted at Astorga, but 45,000 men\r\nmarched on after the British, and were engulfed in the mountains of\r\nGalicia, where they were useless for the main operations of the war.\r\nSpain, in short, gained three months of respite, because the main\r\ndisposable field-army of her invaders had been drawn off into a corner\r\nby the unexpected march of the British on Sahagun. ‘As a diversion the\r\nmovement has answered completely,’ wrote Moore to Castlereagh from\r\nAstorga[739], and with justice. That the subsequent retreat to Corunna\r\nwas also advisable we must concede, though the arguments in favour of\r\nattempting a defence of Galicia were more weighty than has generally\r\nbeen allowed[740].\r\n\r\n  [739] Moore to Castlereagh, from Astorga, Dec. 31, 1808.\r\n\r\n  [740] See the arguments stated on pp. 554-5.\r\n\r\nBut when we turn to the weeks that preceded the advance from Salamanca,\r\nand that followed the departure from Astorga, it is only a very\r\nblind admirer of Moore who will contend that everything was arranged\r\nand ordered for the best. That the army, which began to arrive at\r\nSalamanca on November 13, did not make a forward move till December\r\n12 is a fact which admits of explanation, but not of excuse. The main\r\ngoverning fact of its inactivity was not, as Moore was always urging,\r\nthe disasters of the Spaniards, but the misdirection of the British\r\ncavalry and artillery on the roundabout route by Elvas, Talavera, and\r\nthe Escurial. For this the British general was personally responsible:\r\nwe have already shown that he had good reasons for distrusting the\r\nerroneous reports on the roads of Portugal which were sent in to him,\r\nand that he should not have believed them[741]. He ought to have\r\nmarched on Almeida, with his troops distributed between the three\r\navailable roads, and should have had a compact force of all arms\r\nconcentrated at Salamanca by November 15. Even without Baird he could\r\nthen have exercised some influence on the course of events. As it was,\r\nhe condemned himself--by the unmilitary act of separating himself from\r\nhis guns and his horsemen--to a month of futile waiting, while the fate\r\nof the campaign was being settled a hundred and fifty miles away.\r\n\r\n  [741] See the facts stated on pp. 493-5.\r\n\r\nThe chance that Napoleon turned his whole army upon Madrid, and did\r\nnot send a single corps in search of the British, gave Moore the grand\r\nopportunity for striking at the French communications, which he turned\r\nto such good account in the middle of December. But, though he so\r\nsplendidly vindicated his reputation by this blow, we cannot forget the\r\nlong hesitation at Salamanca by which it was preceded, nor the unhappy\r\nproject for instant retreat on Portugal, which was so nearly put into\r\nexecution. If it had been carried out, Moore’s name would have been\r\nrelegated to a very low place in the list of British commanders, for\r\nhe would undoubtedly have evacuated Lisbon, just as he had prepared\r\nto evacuate Corunna on the day before he was slain. We have his own\r\nwords to that effect. On November 25 he put on paper his opinion as to\r\nthe defence of Portugal. ‘Its frontier,’ he wrote, ‘is not defensible\r\nagainst a superior force. It is an open frontier, all equally rugged,\r\nbut all equally to be penetrated. If the French succeed in Spain, it\r\nwill be vain to attempt to resist them in Portugal. The British must\r\nin that event immediately take steps to evacuate the country[742].’\r\nIt is fortunate that Sir Arthur Wellesley was not of this opinion, or\r\nthe course of the Peninsular War, and of the whole struggle between\r\nBonaparte and Britain, might have been modified in a very unhappy\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\n  [742] Moore to Castlereagh, from Salamanca, Nov. 25.\r\n\r\nSo much must be said of Moore’s earlier faults. Of his later ones,\r\ncommitted after his departure from Astorga, almost as much might be\r\nmade. His long hesitation, as to whether he should march on Vigo or on\r\nCorunna, was inexcusable: at Astorga his mind should have been made\r\nup, and the Vigo road (a bad cross-route on which he had not a single\r\nmagazine) should have been left out of consideration. By failing to\r\nmake up his mind, and taking useless half-measures, Moore deprived\r\nhimself of the services of Robert Crawfurd and 3,500 of the best\r\nsoldiers of his army. But, as we have shown elsewhere, the hesitation\r\nwas in its origin the result of the groundless hypothesis which Moore\r\nhad formed--one knows not from what premises--that the French would\r\nnot be able to pursue him beyond Villafranca.\r\n\r\nStill more open to criticism is the headlong pace at which Moore\r\nconducted the last stages of the retreat. Napier has tried to represent\r\nthat the marches were not unreasonable: ‘in eleven days,’ he wrote, ‘a\r\nsmall army passed over a hundred and fifty miles of good road[743].’\r\nBut we have to deduct three days of rest, leaving an average of about\r\nseventeen miles a day; and this for January marching, in a rugged\r\nsnow-clad country, is no trifle. For though the road was ‘good,’ in the\r\nsense that it was well engineered, it was conducted over ridge after\r\nridge of one of the most mountainous lands in Europe. The desperate\r\nuphill gradients between Astorga and Manzanal, and between Villafranca\r\nand Cerezal, cannot be measured in mere miles when their difficulty is\r\nbeing estimated. The marching should be calculated by hours, and not\r\nby miles. Moreover, Moore repeatedly gave his men night-marches, and\r\neven two night-marches on end. Half the horrors of the dreadful stage\r\nbetween Lugo and Betanzos came from the fact that the army started\r\nat midnight on January 8-9, only rested a few hours by day, and then\r\nmarched again at seven on the evening of the ninth, and through the\r\nwhole of the dark hours between the ninth and tenth. Flesh and blood\r\ncannot endure such a trial even in good weather, and these were nights\r\nof hurricane and downpour. Who can wonder that even well-disposed and\r\nwilling men lagged behind, sank down, and died by hundreds under such\r\nstress?\r\n\r\n  [743] Napier, i. 349.\r\n\r\nAll this hurry was unnecessary: whenever the rearguard turned to face\r\nthe French, Soult was forced to wait for many hours before he could\r\neven begin an attempt to evict it. For his infantry was always many\r\nmiles to the rear, and he could not effect anything with the horsemen\r\nof his advanced guard against Paget’s steady battalions--as Cacabellos\r\nsufficiently showed. Napier urges that any position that the British\r\ntook up could be turned by side-roads: this is true, but the flanking\r\nmovement would always take an inordinate time, and by the moment that\r\nthe French had started upon it, the British rearguard could have\r\ngot off in safety, after having delayed the enemy for the best part\r\nof a day. If, instead of offering resistance only at Cacabellos,\r\nConstantino, and Lugo, Moore had shown fight at three or four other\r\nplaces--e.g. at the narrow pass of Piedrafita, the passage of the\r\nLadra, and the defile of Monte Falqueiro--he need not have hurried his\r\nmain body beyond their strength, and left the road strewn with so many\r\nexhausted stragglers. French and English eye-witnesses alike repeatedly\r\nexpress their surprise that such positions were left undefended.\r\nWhile not disguising the fact that a great proportion of the British\r\nlosses were due to mere want of discipline and sullen discontent on\r\nthe part of the rank and file, we cannot fail to see that this was\r\nnot the sole cause of the disasters of the retreat. The General drove\r\nhis men beyond their strength, when he might, at the cost of a few\r\nrearguard skirmishes, have given them four or five days more in which\r\nto accomplish their retreat. Moore arrived at Corunna on January 11: it\r\nwas January 16 before Soult had so far collected his army that he could\r\nventure to attack. At any other point, the result of offering battle\r\nwould have been much the same. No excuse for Moore can be made on the\r\nground of insufficient supplies: at Villafranca, Lugo, and Betanzos he\r\ndestroyed enormous quantities of food, and often so imperfectly that\r\nthe French succeeded in living for several days on what they could save\r\nfrom the flames.\r\n\r\nIn making these criticisms we are not in the least wishing to impugn\r\nMoore’s reputation as a capable officer and a good general. He was\r\nboth, but his fault was an excessive sense of responsibility. He could\r\nnever forget that he had in his charge, as was said, ‘not _a_ British\r\narmy, but _the_ British army’--the one efficient force that the United\r\nKingdom could put into the field. He was loth to risk it, though\r\nultimately he did so in his admirably conceived march on Sahagun. He\r\nhad also to think of his own career: among his numerous friends and\r\nadmirers he had a reputation for military infallibility which he was\r\nloth to hazard. Acting under a strong sense of duty he did so, but all\r\nthe while he was anxiously asking himself ‘What will they say at home?’\r\nIt was this self-consciousness that was Moore’s weak point. Fortunately\r\nhe was a man of courage and honour, and at the critical moment\r\nrecovered the confidence and decision which was sometimes wanting in\r\nthe hours of doubt and waiting.\r\n\r\nFew men have been better loved by those who knew them best. To have\r\nserved in the regiments which Moore had trained at Shorncliffe in\r\n1803-5, was to be his devoted friend and admirer for life and death.\r\nHandsome, courteous, just, and benevolent, unsparing to himself,\r\nconsiderate to his subordinates, he won all hearts. ‘He was a very king\r\nof men,’ wrote Charles Napier; and Charles’s more eloquent brother has\r\nleft him a panegyric such as few generals have merited and fewer still\r\nobtained[744].\r\n\r\n  [744] ‘Thus ended the career of Sir John Moore, a man whose\r\n  uncommon capacity was sustained by the purest virtue, and\r\n  governed by a disinterested patriotism, more in keeping with\r\n  the primitive than the luxurious age of a great nation. His\r\n  tall graceful person, his dark searching eyes, strongly defined\r\n  forehead, and singularly expressive mouth indicated a noble\r\n  disposition and a refined understanding. The lofty sentiments of\r\n  honour habitual to his mind were adorned by a subtle playful wit,\r\n  which gave him in conversation the ascendency which he always\r\n  preserved by the decisive vigour of his action. He maintained\r\n  the right with a vehemence bordering on fierceness, and every\r\n  important transaction in which he was engaged increased his\r\n  reputation for talent, and confirmed his character as a stern\r\n  enemy to vice, a steadfast friend to merit, a just and faithful\r\n  servant of his country. The honest loved him, the dishonest\r\n  feared him; he did not shun, but scorned and spurned the base,\r\n  and, with characteristic propriety, they spurned at him when he\r\n  was dead.... If glory be a distinction, for such a man death is\r\n  not a leveller!’ (_Peninsular War_, i. 333.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nGODOY’S PROCLAMATION OF OCT. 5, 1806\r\n\r\n\r\nESPAÑOLES!\r\n\r\nEn circunstancias menos arriesgadas que las presentes han procurado\r\nlos vasallos leales auxiliar á sus soberanos con dones y recursos\r\nanticipados á las necesidades; pero en esta prevision tiene el mejor\r\nlugar la generosa accion de súbdito hácia su señor.

Un corps de troupes impériales françaises, de vingt-cinq\r\nmille hommes d’infanterie et de trois de cavalerie, entrera en Espagne,\r\nil fera sa jonction avec un corps de troupes espagnoles, composé de\r\nhuit mille hommes d’infanterie, trois mille de cavalerie, et trente\r\npièces d’artillerie.\r\n\r\n2. Au même tems, une division de troupes espagnoles de dix mille hommes\r\nprendra possession de la province d’entre Minhô et Duero, et de la\r\nville d’Oporto, et une autre division de six mille hommes, composée\r\npareillement de troupes espagnoles, prendra possession de l’Alentéjo et\r\ndu royaume des Algarves.\r\n\r\n3. Les troupes françaises seront nourries et entretenues par l’Espagne,\r\net leur solde payée par la France pendant tout le temps de leur passage\r\nen Espagne.\r\n\r\n4. Depuis le moment où les troupes combinées seront entrées en\r\nPortugal, les provinces de Beira, Tras-los-Montes et l’Estramadure\r\nportugaise (qui doivent rester en dépôt), seront administrées et\r\ngouvernées par le général commandant des troupes françaises, et\r\nles contributions qui leur seront imposées seront au profit de la\r\nFrance. Les provinces qui doivent composer le royaume de la Lusitanie\r\nseptentrionale et la principauté des Algarves seront administrées et\r\ngouvernées par les généraux commandant les divisions espagnoles qui en\r\nprendront possession, et les contributions qui leur seront imposées\r\nresteront au bénéfice de l’Espagne.\r\n\r\n5. Le corps du centre sera sous les ordres du commandant des troupes\r\nfrançaises, aussi bien que les troupes espagnoles qui lui seront\r\nréunies. Cependant, si le roi d’Espagne ou le prince de la Paix\r\ntrouvaient convenable et jugeaient à propos de s’y rendre, le général\r\ncommandant des troupes françaises et elles-mêmes seront soumises aux\r\nordres du roi d’Espagne ou du prince de la Paix.\r\n\r\n6. Un autre corps de quarante mille hommes de troupes françaises sera\r\nréuni à Bayonne le 20 novembre prochain ou avant ce temps-là, et il\r\ndevra être prêt à marcher sur le Portugal, en passant par l’Espagne, si\r\nles Anglais envoient des renforts et menacent d’attaquer le premier.\r\nCependant, ce nouveau corps de troupes n’entrera que quand les deux\r\nhautes parties contractantes se seront mises d’accord pour cet effet.\r\n\r\n7. La présente convention sera ratifiée, et l’échange des ratifications\r\nsera faite au même temps que le traité d’aujourd’hui.\r\n\r\nFait à Fontainebleau, le 27 octobre 1807.\r\n\r\n  DUROC.\r\n\r\n  EUGENIO IZQUIERDO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nPAPERS RELATING TO THE ‘AFFAIR OF THE ESCURIAL’\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER OF CHARLES IV TO NAPOLEON.\r\n\r\nMONSIEUR MON FRÈRE,\r\n\r\nDans le moment où je ne m’occupais que des moyens de coopérer à la\r\ndestruction de notre ennemi commun; quand je croyais que tous les\r\ncomplots de la ci-devant reine de Naples avaient été ensevelis avec\r\nsa fille, je vois avec une horreur qui me fait frémir, que l’esprit\r\nd’intrigue le plus horrible a pénétré jusque dans le sein de mon\r\npalais. Hélas! mon cœur saigne en faisant le récit d’un attentat si\r\naffreux! mon fils aîné, l’héritier présomptif de mon trône, avait formé\r\nle complot horrible de me détrôner; il s’était porté jusqu’à l’excès\r\nd’attenter contre la vie de sa mère! Un attentat si affreux doit être\r\npuni avec la rigueur la plus exemplaire des lois. La loi qui l’appelait\r\nà la succession doit être révoquée: un de ses frères sera plus digne de\r\nle remplacer et dans mon cœur et sur le trône. Je suis dans ce moment à\r\nla recherche de ses complices pour approfondir ce plan de la plus noire\r\nscélératesse; et je ne veux perdre un seul moment pour en instruire V.\r\nM.

Mi hijo ha declarado ya los autores del plan horrible que\r\nle habian hecho concebir unos malvados: todo lo ha manifestado en\r\nforma de derecho, y todo consta con la escrupulosidad que exige la\r\nley en tales pruebas: su arrepentimiento y asombro le han dictado las\r\nrepresentaciones que me ha dirigido.\r\n\r\nEn vista de ellos y á ruego de la reina mi amada esposa perdono á mi\r\nhijo, y le volveré á mi gracia cuando con su conducta me dé pruebas\r\nde una verdadera reforma en su frágil manejo; y mando que los mismos\r\njueces que han entendido en la causa desde su principio la sigan,\r\npermitiéndoles asociados si los necesitaren, y que concluida me\r\nconsulten la sentencia ajustada á la ley, segun fuesen la gravedad\r\nde delitos y calidad de personas en quienes recaigan; teniendo por\r\nprincipio para la formacion de cargos las respuestas dadas por\r\nel príncipe á las demandas que se le han hecho; pues todas estan\r\nrubricadas y firmadas de mi puño, asi como los papeles aprehendidos en\r\nsus mesas, escritos por su mano; y esta providencia se comunique á mis\r\nconsejos y tribunales, circulándola á mis pueblos, para que reconozcan\r\nen ella mi piedad y justicia, y alivien la afliccion y cuidado en que\r\nles puso mi primer decreto; pues en él verán el riesgo de su soberano\r\ny padre que como á hijos los ama, y asi me corresponden.

Por tanto es mi real voluntad que sea reconocido y obedecido\r\ncomo rey y señor natural de todos mis reinos y dominios.

They include only rank and file. The officers\r\nshould have been ninety-eight to a regiment of guards, seventy to a\r\nline regiment, forty-one to a light battalion, thirty-four to a militia\r\nbattalion, forty-two to a cavalry regiment. But most corps were under\r\nstrength in officers, no less than in men, in June, 1808, and Arteche,\r\ngiving every regiment of infantry a complete staff of officers, is\r\nclearly over-estimating them. He gives e.g. 2,450 officers of line\r\ninfantry, the possible maximum, while the _Estado Militar_ for 1808\r\ngives only 1,521 present; so with the militia he gives 1,887 officers,\r\nwhile apparently there were only 1,230 actually existing. It would seem\r\nthat his gross total of 7,222 officers ought to be cut down to 5,911.\r\nFor the rank and file we get:--\r\n\r\nROYAL GUARD.\r\n\r\n  CAVALRY.\r\n                _Numbers._   _Quartered in_\r\n\r\n  Life Guards          615 } Old Castile\r\n  Royal Carabineers    540 } and Madrid.\r\n                     -----\r\n            Total    1,155\r\n\r\n  INFANTRY.\r\n                _Numbers._   _Quartered in_\r\n\r\n  Halberdiers              }\r\n    (one compy.)       152 } Madrid.\r\n\r\n  Spanish Guards           } 1, 2 Barcelona.\r\n    (three batts.)   3,294 } 3 New Castile.\r\n\r\n  Walloon Guards           } 1 Madrid.\r\n    (three                 } 2 Barcelona.\r\n    batts.)          2,58  } 3 Portugal.\r\n                   ------\r\n           Total    6,029\r\n\r\nINFANTRY OF THE LINE.\r\n\r\nN.B.--Each regiment had three battalions of four companies, and should\r\nhave numbered 2,186 bayonets.\r\n\r\n                _Numbers._   _Quartered in_\r\n\r\n  Africa               898 { 1, 3 Andalusia.\r\n                           { 2 S.

A. R. Elle doit avoir acquis la preuve, dans\r\nles papiers qu’elle a eu du roi son père, de l’intérêt que je lui ai\r\ntoujours porté. Elle me permettra, dans la circonstance actuelle, de\r\nlui parler avec franchise et loyauté. En arrivant à Madrid, j’espérais\r\nporter mon illustre ami à quelques réformes nécessaires dans ses Etats,\r\net à donner quelque satisfaction à l’opinion publique. Le renvoi du\r\nprince de la Paix me paraissait nécessaire pour son bonheur et celui de\r\nses peuples. Les affaires du Nord ont retardé mon voyage. Les événemens\r\nd’Aranjuez ont eu lieu. Je ne suis point juge de ce qui s’est passé,\r\net de la conduite du prince de la Paix; mais ce que je sais bien,\r\nc’est qu’il est dangereux pour les rois d’accoutumer les peuples à\r\nrépandre du sang et à se faire justice eux-mêmes. Je prie Dieu que V.\r\nA. R. n’en fasse pas elle-même un jour l’expérience. Il n’est pas de\r\nl’intérêt de l’Espagne de faire du mal à un prince qui a épousé une\r\nprincesse du sang royal, et qui a si long-temps régi le royaume. Il n’a\r\nplus d’amis; V. A. R. n’en aura plus, si jamais elle est malheureuse.\r\nLes peuples se vengent volontiers des hommages qu’ils nous rendent.\r\nComment, d’ailleurs, pourrait-on faire le procès au prince de la Paix,\r\nsans le faire à la reine et au roi votre père? Ce procès alimentera\r\nles haines et les passions factieuses; le résultat en sera funeste\r\npour votre couronne; V. A. R. déchire par là ses droits. Qu’elle ferme\r\nl’oreille à des conseils faibles et perfides. Elle n’a pas le droit\r\nde juger le prince de la Paix: ses crimes, si on lui en reproche, se\r\nperdent dans les droits du trône. J’ai souvent manifesté le désir que\r\nle prince de la Paix fût éloigné des affaires. L’amitié du roi Charles\r\nm’a porté souvent à me taire, et à détourner les yeux des faiblesses\r\nde son attachement. Misérables hommes que nous sommes! faiblesse et\r\nerreur, c’est notre devise. Mais tout cela peut se concilier. Que le\r\nprince de la Paix soit exilé d’Espagne, et je lui offre un refuge en\r\nFrance. Quant à l’abdication de Charles IV, elle a eu lieu dans un\r\nmoment où mes armées couvraient les Espagnes; et, aux yeux de l’Europe\r\net de la postérité, je paraîtrais n’avoir envoyé tant de troupes que\r\npour précipiter du trône mon allié et mon ami. Comme souverain voisin,\r\nil m’est permis de vouloir connaître, avant de reconnaître, cette\r\nabdication. Je le dis à V. A. R., aux Espagnols, au monde entier: Si\r\nl’abdication du roi Charles est de pur mouvement, s’il n’y a pas été\r\nforcé par l’insurrection et l’émeute d’Aranjuez, je ne fais aucune\r\ndifficulté de l’admettre, et je reconnais V. A. R. comme roi d’Espagne.\r\nJe désire donc causer avec elle sur cet objet. La circonspection que je\r\nporte depuis un mois dans ces affaires doit lui être garant de l’appui\r\nqu’elle trouvera en moi, si, à son tour, des factions, de quelque\r\nnature qu’elles soient, venaient à l’inquiéter sur son trône.\r\n\r\nQuand le roi Charles me fit part de l’événement du mois d’octobre\r\ndernier, j’en fus douloureusement affecté, et je pense avoir contribué,\r\npar des insinuations que j’ai faites, à la bonne issue de l’affaire de\r\nl’Escurial. V. A. R. avait bien des torts; je n’en veux pour preuve que\r\nla lettre qu’elle m’a écrite, et que j’ai constamment voulu oublier.\r\nRoi à son tour, elle saura combien les droits du trône sont sacrés.\r\nToute démarche près d’un souverain étranger, de la part d’un prince\r\nhéréditaire, est criminelle. V. A. R. doit se défier des écarts et des\r\némotions populaires.\r\n\r\nOn pourra commettre quelques meurtres sur mes soldats isolés, mais la\r\nruine de l’Espagne en serait le résultat. J’ai déjà vu avec peine qu’à\r\nMadrid on ait répandu des lettres du capitaine-général de la Catalogne,\r\net fait tout ce qui pouvait donner du mouvement aux têtes. V. A. R.\r\nconnaît ma pensée toute entière: elle voit que je flotte entre diverses\r\nidées qui ont besoin d’être fixées. Elle peut être certaine que,\r\ndans tous les cas, je me comporterai avec elle comme avec le roi son\r\npère. Qu’elle croie à mon désir de tout concilier, et de trouver des\r\noccasions de lui donner des preuves de mon affection et de ma parfaite\r\nestime.\r\n\r\nSur ce, je prie Dieu qu’il vous ait en sa sainte et digne garde.\r\n\r\n  NAPOLÉON.\r\n\r\nBayonne, le 16 avril 1808.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ABDICATION OF CHARLES IV.\r\n\r\nArt. Ier. S. M. le roi Charles, n’ayant en vue pendant toute sa vie\r\nque le bonheur de ses sujets, et constant dans le principe, que tous\r\nles actes d’un souverain ne doivent être faits que pour arriver à ce\r\nbut; les circonstances actuelles ne pouvant être qu’une source de\r\ndissensions d’autant plus funestes que les factions ont divisé sa\r\npropre famille, a résolu de céder, comme il cède par le présent, à S.\r\nM. l’empereur Napoléon, tous ses droits sur le trône des Espagnes et\r\ndes Indes, comme au seul qui, au point où en sont arrivées les choses,\r\npeut rétablir l’ordre: entendant que ladite cession n’ait lieu qu’afin\r\nde faire jouir ses sujets des deux conditions suivantes:\r\n\r\n1º. L’intégrité du royaume sera maintenue. Le prince que S. M.\r\nl’empereur Napoléon jugera devoir placer sur le trône d’Espagne\r\nsera indépendant, et les limites de l’Espagne ne souffriront aucune\r\naltération.\r\n\r\n2º. La religion catholique, apostolique et romaine sera la seule en\r\nEspagne. Il ne pourra y être toléré aucune religion réformée, et encore\r\nmoins infidèle, suivant l’usage établi jusqu’aujourd’hui.\r\n\r\nII. Tous actes faits contre ceux de nos fidèles sujets, depuis la\r\nrévolution d’Aranjuez, sont nuls et de nulle valeur, et leurs\r\npropriétés leur seront rendues.\r\n\r\nIII. Sa majesté le roi Charles ayant ainsi assuré la prospérité,\r\nl’intégrité et l’indépendance de ses sujets, Sa Majesté l’Empereur\r\ns’engage à donner refuge dans ses états au roi Charles, à la reine, à\r\nsa famille, au prince de la Paix, ainsi qu’à ceux de leurs serviteurs\r\nqui voudront les suivre, lesquels jouiront en France d’un rang\r\néquivalent à celui qu’ils possédaient en Espagne.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remaining seven articles have reference to the estates and revenues\r\nin France, which the Emperor makes over to Charles IV and his family.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESIGNATION OF HIS RIGHTS BY FERDINAND VII.\r\n\r\nArt. I. Son Altesse Royale le prince des Asturies adhère à la cession\r\nfaite par le roi Charles, de ses droits au trône d’Espagne et des\r\nIndes, en faveur de Sa Majesté l’Empereur des Français, roi d’Italie,\r\net renonce, en tant que de besoin, aux droits qui lui sont acquis,\r\ncomme prince des Asturies, à la couronne des Espagnes et des Indes.\r\n\r\nII. Sa Majesté l’Empereur des Français, roi d’Italie, accorde en France\r\nà Son Altesse Royale le prince des Asturies le titre d’Altesse Royale,\r\navec tous les honneurs et prérogatives dont jouissent les princes de\r\nson rang. Les descendans de Son Altesse Royale le prince des Asturies\r\nconserveront le titre de prince et celui d’Altesse Sérénissime, et\r\nauront toujours le même rang en France, que les princes dignitaires de\r\nl’Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remaining five articles have reference to the estates and revenues\r\nin France, which the Emperor makes over to Ferdinand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE CAPITULATION OF BAYLEN\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Other authorities give Cruz-Murgeon 3,000 men.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that Castaños’ field-army does not comprise the\r\nwhole number of men under arms in Andalusia. Most of the regular\r\nregiments had left behind their third battalion, which was being\r\ncompleted with recruits, and was not fit to take the field. Of all the\r\nregiments only Burgos, Irlanda, and Ordenes Militares seem to have gone\r\nforward three battalions strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. CORRESPONDENCE OF THE FRENCH GENERALS.\r\n\r\n(_a._) GENERAL DUPONT TO GENERAL VEDEL.\r\n\r\nJe vous prie, mon cher général, de vous porter le plus rapidement\r\npossible sur Baylen, pour y faire votre jonction avec le corps qui a\r\ncombattu aujourd’hui à Mengibar et qui s’est replié sur cette ville.\r\nLe sixième régiment provisoire et deux escadrons, l’un de dragons et\r\nl’autre de chasseurs, sont réunis à votre division.\r\n\r\nJ’espère que l’ennemi sera rejeté demain sur Mengibar, au delà du\r\nfleuve, et que les postes de Guarraman et de la Caroline resteront en\r\nsûreté; ils sont d’une grande importance.\r\n\r\nLorsque vous aurez obtenu ce succès, je désire que vous réunissiez\r\nà Andujar une partie de vos forces, afin de combattre l’ennemi qui\r\nse trouve devant nous. Vous ne laisserez à Baylen que ce qui sera\r\nnécessaire pour sa défense.\r\n\r\nSi l’ennemi occupe Baëza, il faut l’en chasser.\r\n\r\nRecevez mes assurances d’amitié.\r\n\r\n  Le général DUPONT.\r\n\r\nAndujar, le 16 juillet 1808.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b._) GENERAL VEDEL TO GENERAL DUPONT.\r\n\r\nMon général,\r\n\r\nIl est huit heures et demie. J’arrive à Baylen, où je n’ai trouvé\r\npersonne. Le général Dufour en est parti à minuit et a marché sur\r\nGuarraman. Comme il n’a laissé personne pour m’instruire des motifs\r\nde cette démarche, je ne puis rien dire de positif à cet égard; mais\r\nle bruit commun étant que les troupes ennemies, qui out attaqué hier\r\nle général Belair, se sont dirigées avec celles qui étaient à Ubeda,\r\nvers les gorges, par Linharès et Sainte-Hélène, on doit penser que le\r\ngénéral Dufour s’est mis à leur poursuite, afin de les combattre.\r\n\r\nComme les instructions de Votre Excellence portent que je dois faire\r\nma jonction avec le corps qui s’était replié sur Baylen, quoique\r\nharassé et fatigué, je partirai d’ici pour me rendre encore aujourd’hui\r\nà Guarraman, afin de regagner la journée que l’ennemi a sur moi,\r\nl’atteindre, le battre, et déjouer ainsi ses projets sur les gorges.\r\n\r\nJe vais écrire au général Dufour, pour l’informer de mon mouvement,\r\nsavoir quelque chose de positif sur sa marche et sur les données qu’il\r\npeut avoir de celle de l’ennemi.\r\n\r\n· · · · · · · · ·\r\n\r\n  Le général de division,\r\n\r\n    VEDEL.\r\n\r\nBaylen, le 17 juillet 1808.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c._) GENERAL DUPONT TO GENERAL VEDEL.\r\n\r\nJ’ai reçu votre lettre de Baylen; d’après le mouvement de l’ennemi, le\r\ngénéral Dufour a très-bien fait de le gagner de vitesse sur la Caroline\r\net sur Sainte-Hélène, pour occuper la tête des gorges; je vois avec\r\nplaisir que vous vous hâtez de vous réunir à lui, afin de combattre\r\navec avantage, si l’ennemi se présente. Mais, au lieu de se rendre à\r\nSainte-Hélène, l’ennemi peut suivre la vieille route, qui de Baëza va à\r\nGuëmada, et qui est parallèle à la grande route; s’il prend ce parti,\r\nil faut le gagner encore de vitesse au débouché de cette route, afin de\r\nl’empêcher de pénétrer dans la Manche. D’après ce que vous me dites, ce\r\ncorps ne serait que d’environ dix mille hommes, et vous êtes en mesure\r\nde la battre complétement; s’il est plus considérable, manœuvrez pour\r\nsuspendre sa marche, ou pour le contenir dans les gorges, en attendant\r\nque j’arrive à votre appui.\r\n\r\n· · · · · · · · ·\r\n\r\nSi vous trouvez l’ennemi à la Caroline, ou sur tout autre point de la\r\ngrande route, tâchez de le battre, pour me venir rejoindre et repousser\r\nce qui est devant Andujar.\r\n\r\n· · · · · · · · ·\r\n\r\n  Mille amitiés.\r\n\r\n    Le général DUPONT.\r\n\r\nAndujar, le 17 juillet 1808.\r\n\r\n\r\nN.B.--It will be seen that by letter (_a_) Dupont deliberately divides\r\nhis army into two halves. By letter (_b_) Vedel shows that he made\r\nno reconnaissances, but acted merely on ‘le bruit commun.’ By letter\r\n(_c_) Dupont accepts Vedel’s erroneous views without suspicion,\r\nand authorizes him to go off on the wild-goose chase which he was\r\nprojecting.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. CAPITULATION.\r\n\r\nLeurs Excellences MM. le comte de Casa Tilly et le général don\r\nFrancisco Xavier Castaños, commandant en chef l’armée d’Espagne en\r\nAndalousie, voulant donner une preuve de leur haute estime à Son\r\nExcellence M. le général comte Dupont, grand aigle de la Légion\r\nd’honneur, commandant en chef le corps d’observation de la Gironde,\r\nainsi qu’à l’armée sous ses ordres, pour la belle et glorieuse défense\r\nqu’ils out faite contre une armée infiniment supérieure en nombre, et\r\nqui les enveloppait de toutes parts; sur la demande de M. le général\r\nde brigade Chabert, commandant de la Légion d’honneur, et chargé\r\ndes pleins pouvoirs de Son Excellence le général en chef de l’armée\r\nfrançaise, en présence de Son Excellence M. le général comte Marescot,\r\ngrand aigle de la Légion d’honneur et premier inspecteur du génie, ont\r\narrêté les conventions suivantes:\r\n\r\nArt. 1er. Les troupes françaises sous les ordres de Son Excellence M.\r\nle général Dupont sont prisonnières de guerre, la division Vedel et les\r\nautres troupes françaises en Andalousie exceptées.\r\n\r\n2. La division de M. le général Vedel, et généralement toutes les\r\ntroupes françaises en Andalousie, qui ne sont pas dans la position de\r\ncelles comprises dans l’article 1er, évacueront l’Andalousie.\r\n\r\n3. Les troupes comprises dans l’article 2 conserveront généralement\r\ntous leurs bagages, et, pour éviter tout sujet de trouble pendant la\r\nmarche, elles remettront leur artillerie, train et autres armes, à\r\nl’armée espagnole, qui s’engage à les leur rendre au moment de leur\r\nembarquement.\r\n\r\n4. Les troupes comprises dans l’article 1er du traité sortiront de\r\nleur camp avec les honneurs de la guerre; chaque bataillon ayant deux\r\ncanons en tête; les soldats armés de leurs fusils, qui seront déposés à\r\nquatre cents toises du camp.\r\n\r\n5. Les troupes de M. le général Vedel et autres, ne devant pas déposer\r\nles armes, les placeront en faisceaux sur le front de bandière; elles\r\ny laisseront aussi leur artillerie et leur train. Il en sera dressé\r\nprocès-verbal par des officiers des deux armées, et le tout leur sera\r\nremis ainsi qu’il est convenu dans l’article 3.\r\n\r\n6. Toutes les troupes françaises en Andalousie se rendront à San-Lucar\r\net à Rota, par journées d’étape, qui ne pourront excéder quatre lieues\r\nde poste, avec les séjours nécessaires, pour y être embarquées sur des\r\nvaisseaux ayant équipage espagnol, et transportées en France au port de\r\nRochefort.\r\n\r\n7. Les troupes françaises seront embarquées aussitôt après leur\r\narrivée. L’armée espagnole assure leur traversée contre toute agression\r\nhostile.\r\n\r\n8. MM. les officiers généraux, supérieurs et autres, conserveront leurs\r\narmes, et les soldats leurs sacs.\r\n\r\n9. Les logements, vivres et fourrages, pendant la marche et la\r\ntraversée, seront fournis à MM. les officiers généraux et autres y\r\nayant droit, ainsi qu’à la troupe, dans la proportion de leur grade, et\r\nsur le pied des troupes espagnoles en temps de guerre.\r\n\r\n10. Les chevaux de MM. les officiers généraux, supérieurs et\r\nd’état-major, dans la proportion de leur grade, seront transportés en\r\nFrance, et nourris sur le pied de guerre.\r\n\r\n11. MM. les officiers généraux conserveront chacun une voiture et un\r\nfourgon; MM. les officiers supérieurs et d’état-major, une voiture\r\nseulement, sans être soumis à aucun examen, _mais sans contrevenir aux\r\nordonnances et aux lois du royaume_.\r\n\r\n12. Sont exceptées de l’article précédent les voitures prises en\r\nAndalousie, dont l’examen sera fait par M. le général Chabert.\r\n\r\n13. Pour éviter la difficulté d’embarquer les chevaux des corps de\r\ncavalerie et d’artillerie, compris dans l’article 2, lesdits chevaux\r\nseront laissés en Espagne, et seront payés, d’après l’estimation\r\nde deux commissaires français et espagnol, et acquittés par le\r\ngouvernement espagnol.\r\n\r\n14. Les blessés et malades de l’armée française, laissés dans les\r\nhôpitaux, seront traités avec le plus grand soin, et seront transportés\r\nen France sous bonne et sûre escorte, aussitôt après leur guérison.\r\n\r\n15. Comme, en diverses rencontres et particulièrement à la prise de\r\nCordoue, plusieurs soldats, au mépris des ordres des généraux et\r\nmalgré les efforts des officiers, se sont portés à des excès qui sont\r\ninévitables dans les villes qui opposent encore de la résistance au\r\nmoment d’être prises, MM. les généraux et autres officiers prendront\r\nles mesures nécessaires pour retrouver les vases sacrés qu’on pourrait\r\navoir enlevés, et les restituer, s’ils existent.\r\n\r\n16. Tous les employés civils, attachés à l’armée française, ne sont pas\r\nconsidérés comme prisonniers de guerre; ils jouiront cependant, pour\r\nleur transport en France, de tous les avantages de la troupe, dans la\r\nproportion de leur emploi.\r\n\r\n17. Les troupes françaises commenceront à évacuer l’Andalousie le 23\r\njuillet, à quatre heures du matin. Pour éviter la grande chaleur, la\r\nmarche des troupes s’effectuera de nuit, et se conformera aux journées\r\nd’étape qui seront réglées par MM. les officiers d’état-major français\r\net espagnols, en évitant le passage des villes de Cordoue et de Séville.\r\n\r\n18. Les troupes françaises, pendant leur marche, seront escortées par\r\nla troupe de ligne espagnole, à raison de trois cents hommes d’escorte\r\npar colonne de trois mille hommes, et MM. les officiers généraux seront\r\nescortés par des détachements de cavalerie et d’infanterie de ligne.\r\n\r\n19. Les troupes, dans leur marche, seront toujours précédées par des\r\ncommissaires français et espagnols, qui devront assurer les logements\r\net les vivres nécessaires, d’après les états qui leur seront remis.\r\n\r\n20. La présente capitulation sera portée de suite à Son Excellence M.\r\nle duc de Rovigo, commandant en chef les troupes françaises en Espagne,\r\npar un officier français qui devra être escorté par des troupes de\r\nligne espagnoles.\r\n\r\n21. Il est convenu par les deux armées qu’il sera ajouté, comme\r\narticles supplémentaires, à la capitulation, ce qui peut avoir été omis\r\net ce qui pourrait encore augmenter le bien-être des troupes françaises\r\npendant leur séjour en Espagne, et pendant la traversée.\r\n\r\n  _Signé_,\r\n\r\n  XAVIER CASTAÑOS.           MARESCOT, Général de Division.\r\n\r\n  CONDE DE TILLY.            CHABERT, Général de Brigade.\r\n\r\n  VENTURA ESCALANTE, Capitan-General de Granada.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY ARTICLES OF AUGUST 6.\r\n\r\nArt. 1er. On a déjà sollicité du roi d’Angleterre et de l’amirauté\r\nanglaise des passe-ports pour la sûreté du passage des troupes\r\nfrançaises.\r\n\r\n2. L’embarquement s’effectuera sur des vaisseaux de l’escadre\r\nespagnole, ou sur tous autres bâtiments de transport qui seront\r\nnécessaires pour conduire le total des troupes françaises, au moins par\r\ndivision, à commencer par celle du général Dupont, et immédiatement\r\naprès, celle du général Vedel.\r\n\r\n3. Le débarquement s’effectuera sur les côtes du Languedoc ou de\r\nProvence, ou bien au port de Lorient, selon que le voyage sera jugé\r\nplus commode et plus court.\r\n\r\n4. On embarquera des vivres pour un mois et plus, afin de prévenir tous\r\nles accidents de la navigation.\r\n\r\n5. Dans le cas qu’on n’obtînt pas de l’Angleterre les passe-ports de\r\nsûreté qu’on a demandés, alors on traitera des moyens les plus propres\r\npour le passage par terre.\r\n\r\n6. Chaque division des troupes françaises sera cantonnée sur différents\r\npoints, dans un rayon de huit à dix lieues, en attendant que le susdit\r\nembarquement ait son effet.\r\n\r\nAinsi fait à Séville, le 6 août 1808.\r\n\r\n  _Signé_,\r\n\r\n    XAVIER CASTAÑOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER OF THE CAPTAIN-GENERAL OF ANDALUSIA, REPUDIATING THE\r\nCAPITULATION.\r\n\r\nMonsieur le général Dupont,\r\n\r\nJe n’ai jamais eu ni de mauvaise foi, ni de fausse dissimulation: de\r\nlà vient ce que j’écrivis à V. E., sous la date du 8, dicté, d’après\r\nmon caractère, par la plus grande candeur, et je suis fâché de me voir\r\nobligé, par votre réponse en date d’hier, de répéter en abrégé ce que\r\nj’eus l’honneur de dire alors à V. E., et ce qui certainement ne peut\r\nmanquer de se vérifier.\r\n\r\nNi la capitulation, ni l’approbation de la junte, ni un ordre exprès\r\nde notre souverain chéri, ne peuvent rendre possible ce qui ne l’est\r\npas; il n’y a point de bâtiments, ni de moyens de s’en procurer pour\r\nle transport de votre armée. Quelle plus grande preuve que celle de\r\nretenir ici très-dispendieusement les prisonniers de votre corps, pour\r\nn’avoir point de quoi les transporter sur d’autres points hors du\r\ncontinent?\r\n\r\nLorsque le général Castaños promit d’obtenir des Anglais des\r\npasse-ports pour le passage de votre armée, il ne put s’obliger à autre\r\nchose qu’à les demander avec instance, et c’est ce qu’il a fait. Mais\r\ncomment V. E. put-elle croire que la nation britannique accéderait à\r\nla laisser passer, certaine qu’elle allait lui faire la guerre sur un\r\nautre point, ou peut-être sur le même?\r\n\r\n_Je me persuade que ni le général Castaños, ni V. E. ne crurent que\r\nladite capitulation pût être exécutée: le but du premier fut de sortir\r\nd’embarras, et celui de V. E. d’obtenir des conditions qui, quoique\r\nimpossibles, honorassent sa reddition indispensable. Chacun de vous\r\nobtint ce qu’il désirait, et maintenant il est nécessaire que la loi\r\nimpérieuse de la nécessité commande._\r\n\r\nLe caractère national ne permet d’en user avec les Français que d’après\r\ncette loi, et non d’après celle des représailles; V. E. m’oblige de\r\nlui exprimer des vérités qui doivent lui être amères. _Quel droit\r\na-t-elle d’exiger l’exécution impossible d’une capitulation avec une\r\narmée qui est entrée en Espagne sous le voile de l’alliance intime et\r\nde l’union, qui a emprisonné notre roi et sa famille royale, saccagé\r\nses palais, assassiné et volé ses sujets, détruit ses campagnes et\r\narraché sa couronne?_ Si V. E. ne veut s’attirer de plus en plus la\r\njuste indignation des peuples, que je travaille tant à réprimer,\r\nqu’elle cesse de semblables et d’aussi intolérables réclamations, et\r\nqu’elle cherche, par sa conduite et sa résignation, à affaiblir la vive\r\nsensation des horreurs qu’elle a commises récemment à Cordoue. V. E.\r\ncroit bien assurément que mon but, en lui faisant cet avertissement,\r\nn’a d’autre objet que son propre bien: le vulgaire irréfléchi ne pense\r\nqu’à payer le mal par le mal, sans apprécier les circonstances, et je\r\nne peux m’empêcher de rendre V. E. responsable des résultats funestes\r\nque peut entraîner sa répugnance à ce qui ne peut manquer d’être.\r\n\r\nLes dispositions que j’ai données à D. Juan Creagh, et qui ont été\r\ncommuniquées à V. E., sont les mêmes que celles de la junte suprême,\r\net sont, en outre, indispensables dans les circonstances actuelles:\r\nle retard de leur exécution alarme les peuples et attire des\r\ninconvénients: déjà ledit Creagh m’a fait part d’un accident qui me\r\ndonne les plus grandes craintes. _Quel stimulant pour la populace, de\r\nsavoir qu’un seul soldat était porteur de 2,180 livres tournois!_\r\n\r\nC’est tout ce que j’ai à répondre à la dépêche de V. E., et j’espère\r\nque celle-ci sera la dernière réponse relative à ces objets, demeurant,\r\nsur toute autre chose, dans le désir de lui être agréable, étant son\r\naffectionné et sincère serviteur,\r\n\r\n  MORLA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE CONVENTION OF CINTRA\r\n\r\n\r\n1. DEFINITIVE CONVENTION FOR THE EVACUATION OF PORTUGAL BY THE FRENCH\r\nARMY.\r\n\r\nThe Generals commanding-in-chief of the British and French armies in\r\nPortugal having determined to negotiate and conclude a treaty for\r\nthe evacuation of Portugal by the French troops, on the basis of\r\nthe agreement entered into on the 22nd instant for a suspension of\r\nhostilities, have appointed the undermentioned officers to negotiate\r\nthe same in their names: viz. on the part of the General-in-chief of\r\nthe British army, Lieut.-Col. Murray, Quartermaster-General, and on the\r\npart of the French army, M. Kellermann, General of Division, to whom\r\nthey have given authority to negotiate and conclude a Convention to\r\nthat effect, subject to their ratification respectively, and to that of\r\nthe Admiral commanding the British fleet at the entrance of the Tagus.\r\nThese two officers, after exchanging their full powers, have agreed\r\nupon the articles which follow:--\r\n\r\nI. All the places and forts in the kingdom of Portugal occupied by the\r\nFrench troops shall be delivered up to the British army in the state in\r\nwhich they are at the moment of the signature of the present Convention.\r\n\r\nII. The French troops shall evacuate Portugal with their arms and\r\nbaggage: they shall not be considered prisoners of war: and on their\r\narrival in France they shall be at liberty to serve.\r\n\r\nIII. The English Government shall furnish the means of conveyance for\r\nthe French army, which shall be disembarked in any of the ports of\r\nFrance between Rochefort and L’Orient inclusively.\r\n\r\nIV. The French army shall carry with it all its artillery of French\r\ncalibre, with the horses belonging to it, and the tumbrils supplied\r\nwith sixty rounds per gun. All other artillery arms and ammunition, as\r\nalso the military and naval arsenals, shall be given up to the British\r\narmy and navy, in the state in which they may be at the period of the\r\nratification of the Convention.\r\n\r\nV. The French army shall carry away with it all its equipment, and\r\nall that is comprehended under the name of property of the army, that\r\nis to say its military chest, and the carriages attached to the field\r\ncommissariat and field hospital, or shall be allowed to dispose of such\r\npart of the same on its account, as the Commander-in-chief may judge\r\nit unnecessary to embark. In like manner all individuals of the army\r\nshall be at liberty to dispose of all their private property of every\r\ndescription, with full security hereafter for the purchasers.\r\n\r\nVI. The cavalry are to embark their horses, as also the Generals and\r\nother officers of all ranks: it is, however, fully understood that the\r\nmeans of conveyance[745] for horses at the disposal of the British\r\nCommander-in-chief are very limited: some additional conveyance may be\r\nprocured in the port of Lisbon.\r\n\r\n  [745] Of transports fitted for carrying horses Dalrymple only had\r\n  at this moment those which had brought 180 horses for the 20th\r\n  Light Dragoons, 300 of the Irish commissariat, and 560 of the 3rd\r\n  Light Dragoons of the German Legion, which had just arrived with\r\n  Moore.\r\n\r\nVII. In order to facilitate the embarkation, it shall take place in\r\nthree divisions, the last of which will be principally composed of the\r\ngarrisons of the places, of the cavalry and artillery, the sick, and\r\nthe equipment of the army. The first division shall embark within seven\r\ndays from the ratification of the Convention, or sooner if possible.\r\n\r\nVIII. The garrisons of Elvas, Peniche, and Palmella will be embarked at\r\nLisbon; that of Almeida at Oporto, or the nearest harbour. They will\r\nbe accompanied on their march by British commissaries, charged with\r\nproviding for their subsistence and accommodation.\r\n\r\nIX. All the French sick and wounded who cannot be embarked are\r\nentrusted to the British army.... The English Government shall provide\r\nfor their return to France, which shall take place by detachments of\r\n150 or 200 men at a time[@ 746 repetido].\r\n\r\nX. As soon as the vessels employed to carry the army to France shall\r\nhave disembarked it ... every facility shall be given them to return to\r\nEngland without delay: they shall have security against capture until\r\ntheir arrival in a friendly port[746].\r\n\r\n  [746] These articles are shortened of some unimportant verbiage\r\n  and details.\r\n\r\nXI. The French army shall be concentrated in Lisbon, or within a\r\ndistance of about two leagues from it. The British army will approach\r\nto within three leagues of the capital, so as to leave about one league\r\nbetween the two armies.\r\n\r\nXII. The forts of St. Julian, the Bugio, and Cascaes shall be occupied\r\nby the British troops on the ratification of the Convention. Lisbon\r\nand its forts and batteries, as far as the Lazaretto or Trafaria on\r\none side, and the Fort St. Joseph on the other inclusively, shall be\r\ngiven up on the embarkation of the second division, as shall be also\r\nthe harbour and all the armed vessels in it of every description,\r\nwith their rigging, sails, stores, and ammunition. The fortresses of\r\nElvas, Almeida, Peniche, and Palmella shall be given up so soon as\r\nBritish troops can arrive to occupy them: in the meantime the British\r\nGeneral-in-chief will give notice of the present Convention to the\r\ngarrisons of those places, as also to the troops in front of them, in\r\norder to put a stop to further hostilities.\r\n\r\nXIII. Commissaries shall be appointed on both sides to regulate and\r\naccelerate the execution of the arrangements agreed upon.\r\n\r\nXIV. Should there arise any doubt as to the meaning of any article, it\r\nshall be explained favourably to the French army.\r\n\r\nXV. From the date of the ratification of the present Convention, all\r\narrears of contributions, requisitions, and claims of the French\r\nGovernment against the subjects of Portugal, or other individuals\r\nresiding in this country, founded on the occupation of Portugal by the\r\nFrench troops since December, 1807, which may not have been paid up are\r\ncancelled; and all sequestrations laid upon their property, movable or\r\nimmovable, are removed, and the free disposal of the same is restored\r\nto their proper owners.\r\n\r\nXVI. All subjects of France, or of powers in friendship or alliance\r\nwith France, domiciliated in Portugal, or accidentally in this\r\ncountry, shall be protected. Their property of every kind, movable and\r\nimmovable, shall be respected, and they shall be at liberty either to\r\naccompany the French army or to remain in Portugal. In either case\r\ntheir property is guaranteed to them with the liberty of retaining or\r\ndisposing of it, and of passing the sale[747] of it into France or any\r\nother country where they may fix their residence, the space of one year\r\nbeing allowed them for that purpose.\r\n\r\n  [747] The meaning of this odd and crabbed phrase is shown by the\r\n  French duplicate of the Convention--‘d’en faire passer le produit\r\n  en France.’ Murray should have written ‘the proceeds’ instead of\r\n  ‘the sale.’\r\n\r\nIt is fully understood that shipping is excepted from this arrangement;\r\nonly, however, as regards leaving the port, and that none of the\r\nstipulations above mentioned can be made the pretext of any commercial\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nXVII. No native of Portugal shall be rendered accountable for his\r\npolitical conduct during the period of the occupation of this country\r\nby the French army. And all those who have continued in the exercise\r\nof their employments, or who have accepted situations under the French\r\nGovernment, are placed under the protection of the British commanders.\r\nThey shall suffer no injury in their persons or property, it not having\r\nbeen at their option to be obedient or not to the French Government.\r\nThey are also at liberty to avail themselves of the stipulations of the\r\nsixteenth article.\r\n\r\nXVIII. The Spanish troops detained on board ship in the port of Lisbon\r\nshall be given up to the General-in-chief of the British army, who\r\nengages to obtain of the Spaniards to restore such French subjects,\r\neither military or civil, as may have been detained[748] in Spain,\r\nwithout having been taken in battle or in consequence of military\r\noperations, but on the occasion of the occurrences of the 29th of May\r\nlast, and the days immediately following.\r\n\r\n  [748] Murray’s English does not here translate Kellermann’s\r\n  French: the latter has ‘détenus en Espagne,’ i.e. ‘at present\r\n  prisoners in Spain,’ not ‘who may have been detained in Spain.’\r\n  For the persons intended were primarily General Quesnel, his\r\n  staff, and escort, who had been seized in Portugal and then taken\r\n  into Spain. The clause also covered some French officers and\r\n  commissaries who had been seized at Badajoz and elsewhere while\r\n  making their way to Lisbon, at the moment when the insurrection\r\n  broke out.\r\n\r\nXIX. There shall be an immediate exchange established for all ranks\r\nof prisoners made in Portugal since the commencement of the present\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\nXX. Hostages of the rank of field-officers shall be mutually furnished\r\non the part of the British army and navy, and on that of the French\r\narmy, for the reciprocal guarantee of the present Convention.\r\n\r\nThe officer representing the British army to be restored on the\r\ncompletion of the articles which concern the army, and the officer\r\nof the navy on the disembarkation of the French troops in their own\r\ncountry. The like is to take place on the part of the French army[749].\r\n\r\n  [749] The hostage for the English army was Col. Donkin. I cannot\r\n  find out who was the naval hostage.\r\n\r\nXXI. It shall be allowed to the General-in-chief of the French army to\r\nsend an officer to France with intelligence of the present Convention.\r\nA vessel will be furnished by the British Admiral to carry him to\r\nBordeaux or Rochefort.\r\n\r\nXXII. The British Admiral will be invited to accommodate His Excellency\r\nthe Commander-in-chief[750] and the other principal French officers on\r\nboard of ships of war.\r\n\r\n  [750] i.e. Junot and his chief officers preferred the\r\n  hospitalities of a man of war to the hard fare of a transport.\r\n\r\nDone and concluded at Lisbon this thirteenth day of August, 1808.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE MURRAY, Quar.-Mas.-Gen.\r\n  KELLERMANN, Général de Division.\r\n\r\nThree unimportant supplementary articles were added, one stipulating\r\nthat French civilian prisoners in the hands of the English or\r\nPortuguese should be released, another that the French army should\r\nsubsist on its own magazines till it embarked, a third that the British\r\nshould allow the free entry of provisions into Lisbon after the\r\nsignature of the Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. REPORT OF THE COURT OF INQUIRY.\r\n\r\nOn a consideration of all circumstances, as set forth in this Report,\r\nwe most humbly submit our opinion, that no further military proceeding\r\nis necessary on the subject. Because, howsoever some of us may differ\r\nin our sentiments respecting the fitness of the Convention in the\r\nrelative situation of the two armies, it is our unanimous declaration,\r\nthat unquestionable zeal and firmness appear throughout to have been\r\nexhibited by Lieut.-Generals Sir Hew Dalrymple, Sir Harry Burrard,\r\nand Sir Arthur Wellesley, as well as that the ardour and gallantry of\r\nthe rest of the officers and soldiers, on every occasion during this\r\nexpedition, have done honour to the troops, and reflected lustre on\r\nYour Majesty’s arms.\r\n\r\nAll which is most dutifully submitted.\r\n\r\n(Signed)\r\n\r\n  DAVID DUNDAS, General.\r\n  MOIRA, General.\r\n  PETER CRAIG, General.\r\n  HEATHFIELD, General.\r\n  PEMBROKE, Lieut.-Gen.\r\n  G. NUGENT, Lieut.-Gen.\r\n  OL. NICHOLLS, Lieut.-Gen.\r\n\r\nDec. 22, 1808.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. LORD MOIRA’S ‘OPINION.’\r\n\r\nI feel less awkwardness in obeying the order to detail my sentiments\r\non the nature of the Convention, because that I have already joined\r\nin the tribute of applause due in other respects to the Officers\r\nconcerned. My opinion, therefore, is only opposed to theirs on a\r\nquestion of judgment, where their talents are likely to have so much\r\nmore weight, as to render the profession of my difference, even on that\r\npoint, somewhat painful. Military duty is, however, imperious on me not\r\nto disguise or qualify the deductions which I have made during this\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nAn Armistice simply might not have been objectionable, because Sir\r\nHew Dalrymple, expecting hourly the arrival of Sir John Moore’s\r\ndivision, might see more advantage for himself in a short suspension\r\nof hostilities, than what the French could draw from it. But as the\r\nArmistice involved, and in fact established, the whole principle of the\r\nConvention, I cannot separate it from the latter.\r\n\r\nSir Arthur Wellesley has stated that he considered his force, at the\r\ncommencement of the march from the Mondego river, as sufficient to\r\ndrive the French from their positions on the Tagus. That force is\r\nsubsequently joined by above 4,000 British troops, under Generals\r\nAnstruther and Acland. The French make an attack with their whole\r\ndisposable strength, and are repulsed with heavy loss, though but a\r\npart of the British army is brought into action. It is difficult to\r\nconceive that the prospects which Sir Arthur Wellesley entertained\r\ncould be unfavourably altered by these events, even had not the\r\ncertainty of speedy reinforcements to the British army existed.\r\n\r\nIt is urged, that, had the French been pushed to extremity, they would\r\nhave crossed the Tagus, and have protracted the campaign in such a\r\nmanner as to have frustrated the more important view of the British\r\nGenerals, namely, sending succours into Spain.\r\n\r\nThis measure must have been equally feasible for the French if no\r\nvictory had been obtained over them; but I confess that the chance\r\nof such an attempt seems to me assumed against probability. Sir Hew\r\nDalrymple notices what he calls ‘the critical and embarrassed state\r\nof Junot,’ before that General has been pressed by the British army;\r\nand, in explanation of that expression, observes, that the surrender\r\nof Dupont, the existence of the victorious Spanish army in Andalusia,\r\nwhich cut off the retreat of the French in that direction, and the\r\nuniversal hostility of the Portuguese, made the situation of Junot\r\none of great distress. No temptation for the translation of the\r\nwar into Alemtejo presents itself from this picture; nor does any\r\nother representation give ground to suppose, that Junot could have\r\ncontemplated the measure, as holding forth any prospect but ultimate\r\nruin, after much preliminary distress and disgrace. The strongest of\r\nall proofs as to Junot’s opinion, arises from his sending the very\r\nmorning after the battle of Vimiero, to propose the evacuation of\r\nPortugal; a step which sufficiently indicated that he was satisfied he\r\ncould not only make no effectual defence, but could not even prolong\r\nthe contest to take the chance of accidents. He seems, indeed, to have\r\nbeen without any real resource.\r\n\r\nI humbly conceive it to have been erroneous to regard the emancipation\r\nof Portugal from the French, as the sole or the principal object of the\r\nexpedition.--Upon whatever territory we contend with the French, it\r\nmust be a prominent object in the struggle to destroy their resources,\r\nand to narrow their means of injuring us, or those whose cause we\r\nare supporting. This seems to have been so little considered in the\r\nConvention, that the terms appear to have extricated Junot’s army from\r\na situation of infinite distress, in which it was wholly out of play,\r\nand to have brought it, in a state of entire equipment, into immediate\r\ncurrency, in a quarter too, where it must interfere with our most\r\nurgent and interesting concerns.\r\n\r\nHad it been impracticable to reduce the French army to lay down its\r\narms unconditionally, still an obligation not to serve for a specified\r\ntime might have been insisted upon, or Belleisle might have been\r\nprescribed as the place at which they should be landed, in order to\r\nprevent the possibility of their reinforcing (at least for a long\r\ntime) the armies employed for the subjugation of Spain. Perhaps a\r\nstronger consideration than the merit of those terms presents itself.\r\nOpinion relative to the British arms was of the highest importance,\r\nas it might influence the confidence of the Spaniards, or invite the\r\nnations groaning under the yoke of France, to appeal to this country,\r\nand co-operate with it for their deliverance. The advantages ought,\r\ntherefore, to have been more than usually great, which should be deemed\r\nsufficient to balance the objection of granting to a very inferior\r\narmy, hopeless in circumstances, and broken in spirit, such terms as\r\nmight argue, that, notwithstanding its disparity in numbers, it was\r\nstill formidable to its victors. No advantages seem to have been gained\r\nthat would not have equally followed from forcing the enemy to a more\r\nmarked submission. The gain of time as to sending succours into Spain\r\ncannot be admitted as a plea; because it appears that no arrangements\r\nfor the reception of our troops in Spain had been undertaken previous\r\nto the Convention; and this is without reasoning on subsequent facts.\r\n\r\nI trust that these reasons will vindicate me from the charge of\r\npresumption, in maintaining an opinion contradictory to that professed\r\nby so many most respectable Officers; for, even if the reasons be\r\nessentially erroneous, if they are conclusive to my mind (as I must\r\nconscientiously affirm them to be), it is a necessary consequence that\r\nI must disapprove the Convention.\r\n\r\n  MOIRA, General.\r\n\r\nDecember 27, 1808.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTHE CENTRAL JUNTA OF REGENCY\r\n\r\nLIST OF THE MEMBERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nN.B.--The notes as to individuals are extracted from Arguelles.\r\n\r\n1.

Their force was trifling--a single squadron, or at most two.\r\nIf we give them 600 men in all, we shall probably be not far wrong.\r\nSeveral regular cavalry regiments had left the _cadre_ of one or two\r\nsquadrons behind.\r\n\r\nThe existence of all these regiments in November--December can be\r\nproved. The 2nd and 4th of Seville reached Madrid in time to join in\r\nits defence against Napoleon, and then fled to join the Army of the\r\nCentre. The figures given are their January strengths, when they had\r\nalready suffered severely. The Malaga regiment’s figure is from _Madrid\r\nGazette_ of Nov. 29, recording its march out to Granada. The militia\r\nbattalions Jerez, Malaga, Ronda, Ecija were all in existence in June,\r\nthey did not march to the Ebro, and are found in the Army of the Centre\r\nin the spring of 1809. España was apparently in garrison at Ceuta,\r\nand only brought up to the front early in 1809. Velez Malaga, 2nd of\r\nAntequera, and Osuna are first heard of under Del Palacio in January,\r\n1809. They must have been raised by December at the latest.\r\n\r\nThe total of the Andalusian reserves accounted for in this table is\r\n13,371, but no such number could have been sent forward in December, as\r\nmany of the battalions were not properly armed, much less uniformed.\r\nBut some of the volunteers, all the militia, and the regular regiment\r\nEspaña--perhaps 6,000 or 7,000 in all--should have been at Madrid by\r\nDec. 1. Only 1,000 bayonets actually reached it before Napoleon’s\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nIt would seem then that the second line of the Spanish Army consisted\r\nof something like the following numbers:--\r\n\r\n                                                     _Men._\r\n  Army of Reserve of Madrid                          12,118\r\n  Reding’s Granadan Divisions                        15,000\r\n  Galician Reserves                                   3,610\r\n  Asturian Reserves                                   5,285\r\n  Estremaduran Reserves                               4,608\r\n  Balearic Isles Reserves                             3,360\r\n  Murcian and Valencian Reserves                      5,774\r\n  Andalusian Reserves                                13,371\r\n  Cavalry from Denmark, in march for Estremadura      2,252\r\n                                                     ------\r\n                                         Total       65,378\r\n\r\nSome of the battalions (e.g. the Valencians and Murcians who went to\r\nSaragossa) must have been much stronger in December; on the other hand,\r\nothers (e.g. the Estremadurans) are probably over-estimated: they\r\nshowed no such figures as those given above, when they took the field\r\nearly in 1809.\r\n\r\nN.B.--In several armies, notably in those of Aragon and the Centre,\r\nthere are doubtful points. It is impossible to speak with certainty of\r\nthe number of battalions which some corps took to the front. It will be\r\nnoted that all the numbers given are much larger than those attributed\r\nby Napier (i. 504) to the Spanish armies. I have worked from detailed\r\nofficial figures, the greater part of which seem perfectly trustworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH ARMY OF SPAIN\r\n\r\nIN NOVEMBER, 1808.\r\n\r\nN.B.--The distribution of the regiments is that of November. The\r\ndetailed strength of the corps, however, comes from an October return,\r\nand there had been several changes at the end of that month.\r\n\r\n\r\n1ST CORPS.

The cavalry was afterwards strengthened by the 4th Hussars\r\nfrom the 1st Corps. The 121st of the Line (four batts.) arrived in\r\nDecember, and joined Morlot. The battalions in square brackets were\r\nleft behind in the garrisons of Biscay and Navarre.\r\n\r\nThe gross total of the corps on Oct. 10 was 37,690 men, of whom 11,082\r\nwere detached in garrisons, &c. and 7,522 in hospital.\r\n\r\n4TH CORPS.

But this does not include several\r\nregiments which did not join St. Cyr from Italy till long after the\r\ndate of the return. In January, 1809, he had 41,386 men present with\r\nthe colours, and 6,589 in hospital, besides 543 prisoners. There had\r\nalso been considerable losses in the fighting. Probably the corps in\r\nNovember--December was well over 50,000 strong.\r\n\r\n8TH CORPS. General JUNOT, Duke of Abrantes.\r\n\r\nDissolved in December, 1808.

It would seem, therefore, that\r\nabout 1,748 men in small detachments joined the army at Salamanca and\r\nelsewhere before Dec. 19. They must represent drafts and convoy-escorts\r\ncoming up from Portugal. The apparent deficiency for the campaign\r\ntherefore is 8,783. But it must not be supposed that these 8,783 men\r\nwere all lost between Salamanca and Corunna: from them we must deduct\r\n(1) the 296 casualties by shipwreck while returning to England; (2)\r\n589 rank and file who escaped individually to Portugal, and were then\r\nenrolled (along with the convalescent sick left behind by Moore’s\r\nregiments) in the two ‘battalions of detachments’ which fought at\r\nTalavera; (3) the number of sick discharged from Salamanca on to\r\nPortugal in the convoys escorted by the 5/60th and 3rd Regiments. I can\r\nnowhere find the number of these invalids stated, but it must have been\r\nlarge, as the total of the sick belonging to the whole army was nearly\r\n4,000 in December. It will be a very modest estimate if we give 1,500\r\nfor those of them who were at Salamanca, the head quarters hospital of\r\nthe army, and were capable of being moved back to Portugal.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore deduct under these three heads about 2,385 men. This\r\nfigure taken from 8,783 leaves 6,398 for the real loss in the campaign.\r\n\r\nBut even from this total 400 more must be deducted, for 400 British\r\nconvalescents were released by the Galician insurgents from French\r\ncaptivity and sent back to Lisbon in the spring of 1809. [‘Further\r\npapers relative to Spain and Portugal,’ p. 7 in _Parliamentary Papers_\r\nfor 1809.]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, about 5,998 men were actually lost. Napier’s\r\nestimate of 3,233 (i. 502) for the total loss is certainly too low.\r\nOf these 2,189 were prisoners sent to France. [Schepeler, ‘Table of\r\nprisoners sent to France, 1809-13’ on p. 150.] The remaining 3,809\r\nperished in battle, by the road, or in hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Acevedo, general, commands division under Blake, 408;\r\n    wounded at Espinosa, 415;\r\n    murdered by the French, 426.\r\n\r\n  Acland, brigadier-general, arrives at Peniche, 241;\r\n    at Vimiero, 249-58;\r\n    gives evidence before the Court of Inquiry, 294.\r\n\r\n  Afrancesados, party of the, in Spain, 97.\r\n\r\n  Alagon, Palafox defeated at, 145.\r\n\r\n  Alcedo, general, governor of Corunna, surrenders to Soult, 596.\r\n\r\n  Alcolea, combat of, 129.\r\n\r\n  Alexander, Emperor of Russia,\r\n    his meeting with Napoleon at Erfurt, 377.\r\n\r\n  Andalusia, province of, rises against the French, 69;\r\n    its geography, 74, 80.\r\n\r\n  Anstruther, brigadier-general, arrives in Portugal, 248;\r\n    at Vimiero, 250-61;\r\n    in command at Almeida, 494;\r\n    dies at Corunna, 595.\r\n\r\n  Antonio, Don, brother of Charles IV,\r\n    appointed head of the Junta of Regency, 48;\r\n    goes to Bayonne, 62;\r\n    at Valençay, 56.\r\n\r\n  Army, the Spanish, its character and organization, 89-95:\r\n    _see_ also Tables and Appendices v, viii, &c.\r\n\r\n  Army of Spain, the French, character of the first, 103-7;\r\n    of the second, 107-13:\r\n    _see_ also Tables and Appendices vi, &c.\r\n\r\n  Artillery, the, of the Spanish army, 94, 95;\r\n    of the French army, 112;\r\n    tactics of the, 120-2.\r\n\r\n  Asturias, Prince of the: _see_ Ferdinand.\r\n\r\n  Asturias, province of the, declares war on France, 65;\r\n    sends emissaries to England, 66;\r\n    sends troops to Blake’s army, 382, 384.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Baget, Juan, leader of Catalan _miqueletes_, 318, 322, 328.\r\n\r\n  Baird, Sir David, general, lands at Corunna, 484, 491, 498;\r\n    advances to Astorga, 500;\r\n    joins Moore at Mayorga, 532;\r\n    wounded at Corunna, 584, 589.\r\n\r\n  Barcelona, treacherously seized by Duhesme, 36;\r\n    operations round, 302, 318.\r\n\r\n  Baylen, battle of, 187-92;\r\n    Convention of, 197-9;\r\n    text of the Convention, Appendix, 621-3.\r\n\r\n  Bayonne, French troops at, 6-12, 34;\r\n    treachery of Napoleon at, 51-6.\r\n\r\n  Beauharnais, Marquis of, French ambassador at Madrid,\r\n    his negotiations with Ferdinand, Prince of the Asturias, 19, 20;\r\n    refuses to acknowledge Ferdinand as King, 43, 46.\r\n\r\n  Belesta, general, joins Blake with his division, 208.\r\n\r\n  Belvedere, Conde de, defeated at Gamonal, 421-3.\r\n\r\n  Bembibre, the British at, 566.\r\n\r\n  Benavente, combat of, 549-51.\r\n\r\n  Bentinck, Lord William,\r\n    British military representative in Madrid, 365;\r\n    endeavours to get information from the Junta, 488;\r\n    his correspondence with Moore, 504;\r\n    at Corunna, 584.\r\n\r\n  Bernadotte, Jean Baptiste, marshal, Prince of Ponte Corvo,\r\n    in command on the Baltic, 368;\r\n    tricked by La Romana, 373.\r\n\r\n  Bessières, Jean Baptiste, marshal, Duke of Istria,\r\n    leads a _corps d’armée_ into Spain, 40;\r\n    his first operations, 125, 126;\r\n    operations in Northern Spain, 140, 142, 166-72;\r\n    victory at Medina de Rio Seco, 169-72;\r\n    represses rising in Biscay, 356;\r\n    superseded by Soult, 418;\r\n    pursues Infantado, 470.\r\n\r\n  Bessières, general, leads French cavalry in Catalonia, 309, 318.\r\n\r\n  Betanzos, the stragglers’ battle at, during Moore’s retreat, 579.\r\n\r\n  Bilbao, taken and sacked by Merlin, 356;\r\n    taken by Blake, 383;\r\n    taken by Lefebvre, 400.\r\n\r\n  Biscay, rising in, 355, 356.\r\n\r\n  Blake, Joachim, captain-general of the province of Galicia, 163;\r\n    his differences with Cuesta, 165;\r\n    defeated at Medina de Rio Seco, 168-72;\r\n    his operations in Biscay, 382, 384, 400;\r\n    defeated at Zornoza, 407;\r\n      at Valmaceda, 411;\r\n      at Espinosa, 413-6;\r\n    escapes into the Asturian hills, 427;\r\n    superseded by La Romana, 427.\r\n\r\n  Bonaparte, Joseph: _see_ Joseph Napoleon.\r\n\r\n  Bonaparte, Louis, King of Holland, refuses the crown of Spain, 46.\r\n\r\n  Bonnet, general, at Gamonal, 422;\r\n    occupies Santander, 429.\r\n\r\n  Bowes, general, B.
