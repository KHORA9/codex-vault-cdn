The Editor.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The great work of Gibbon is indispensable to the student of\r\n      history. The literature of Europe offers no substitute for “The\r\n      Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.” It has obtained undisputed\r\n      possession, as rightful occupant, of the vast period which it\r\n      comprehends. However some subjects, which it embraces, may have\r\n      undergone more complete investigation, on the general view of the\r\n      whole period, this history is the sole undisputed authority to\r\n      which all defer, and from which few appeal to the original\r\n      writers, or to more modern compilers. The inherent interest of\r\n      the subject, the inexhaustible labor employed upon it; the\r\n      immense condensation of matter; the luminous arrangement; the\r\n      general accuracy; the style, which, however monotonous from its\r\n      uniform stateliness, and sometimes wearisome from its elaborate\r\n      ar., is throughout vigorous, animated, often picturesque, always\r\n      commands attention, always conveys its meaning with emphatic\r\n      energy, describes with singular breadth and fidelity, and\r\n      generalizes with unrivalled felicity of expression; all these\r\n      high qualifications have secured, and seem likely to secure, its\r\n      permanent place in historic literature.\r\n\r\n      This vast design of Gibbon, the magnificent whole into which he\r\n      has cast the decay and ruin of the ancient civilization, the\r\n      formation and birth of the new order of things, will of itself,\r\n      independent of the laborious execution of his immense plan,\r\n      render “The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” an\r\n      unapproachable subject to the future historian: 101 in the\r\n      eloquent language of his recent French editor, M. Guizot:—\r\n\r\n      101 (return) [ A considerable portion of this preface has already\r\n      appeared before us public in the Quarterly Review.]\r\n\r\n      “The gradual decline of the most extraordinary dominion which has\r\n      ever invaded and oppressed the world; the fall of that immense\r\n      empire, erected on the ruins of so many kingdoms, republics, and\r\n      states both barbarous and civilized; and forming in its turn, by\r\n      its dismemberment, a multitude of states, republics, and\r\n      kingdoms; the annihilation of the religion of Greece and Rome;\r\n      the birth and the progress of the two new religions which have\r\n      shared the most beautiful regions of the earth; the decrepitude\r\n      of the ancient world, the spectacle of its expiring glory and\r\n      degenerate manners; the infancy of the modern world, the picture\r\n      of its first progress, of the new direction given to the mind and\r\n      character of man—such a subject must necessarily fix the\r\n      attention and excite the interest of men, who cannot behold with\r\n      indifference those memorable epochs, during which, in the fine\r\n      language of Corneille—\r\n\r\n     ‘Un grand destin commence, un grand destin s’achève.’”\r\n\r\n      This extent and harmony of design is unquestionably that which\r\n      distinguishes the work of Gibbon from all other great historical\r\n      compositions. He has first bridged the abyss between ancient and\r\n      modern times, and connected together the two great worlds of\r\n      history. The great advantage which the classical historians\r\n      possess over those of modern times is in unity of plan, of course\r\n      greatly facilitated by the narrower sphere to which their\r\n      researches were confined. Except Herodotus, the great historians\r\n      of Greece—we exclude the more modern compilers, like Diodorus\r\n      Siculus—limited themselves to a single period, or at ‘east to the\r\n      contracted sphere of Grecian affairs. As far as the Barbarians\r\n      trespassed within the Grecian boundary, or were necessarily\r\n      mingled up with Grecian politics, they were admitted into the\r\n      pale of Grecian history; but to Thucydides and to Xenophon,\r\n      excepting in the Persian inroad of the latter, Greece was the\r\n      world. Natural unity confined their narrative almost to\r\n      chronological order, the episodes were of rare occurrence and\r\n      extremely brief. To the Roman historians the course was equally\r\n      clear and defined. Rome was their centre of unity; and the\r\n      uniformity with which the circle of the Roman dominion spread\r\n      around, the regularity with which their civil polity expanded,\r\n      forced, as it were, upon the Roman historian that plan which\r\n      Polybius announces as the subject of his history, the means and\r\n      the manner by which the whole world became subject to the Roman\r\n      sway. How different the complicated politics of the European\r\n      kingdoms! Every national history, to be complete, must, in a\r\n      certain sense, be the history of Europe; there is no knowing to\r\n      how remote a quarter it may be necessary to trace our most\r\n      domestic events; from a country, how apparently disconnected, may\r\n      originate the impulse which gives its direction to the whole\r\n      course of affairs.\r\n\r\n      In imitation of his classical models, Gibbon places _Rome_ as the\r\n      cardinal point from which his inquiries diverge, and to which\r\n      they bear constant reference; yet how immeasurable the space over\r\n      which those inquiries range! how complicated, how confused, how\r\n      apparently inextricable the causes which tend to the decline of\r\n      the Roman empire! how countless the nations which swarm forth, in\r\n      mingling and indistinct hordes, constantly changing the\r\n      geographical limits—incessantly confounding the natural\r\n      boundaries! At first sight, the whole period, the whole state of\r\n      the world, seems to offer no more secure footing to an historical\r\n      adventurer than the chaos of Milton—to be in a state of\r\n      irreclaimable disorder, best described in the language of the\r\n      poet:—\r\n\r\n     —“A dark Illimitable ocean, without bound, Without dimension,\r\n     where length, breadth, and height,\r\n     And time, and place, are lost: where eldest Night And Chaos,\r\n     ancestors of Nature, hold Eternal anarchy, amidst the noise Of\r\n     endless wars, and by confusion stand.”\r\n\r\n      We feel that the unity and harmony of narrative, which shall\r\n      comprehend this period of social disorganization, must be\r\n      ascribed entirely to the skill and luminous disposition of the\r\n      historian. It is in this sublime Gothic architecture of his work,\r\n      in which the boundless range, the infinite variety, the, at first\r\n      sight, incongruous gorgeousness of the separate parts,\r\n      nevertheless are all subordinate to one main and predominant\r\n      idea, that Gibbon is unrivalled. We cannot but admire the manner\r\n      in which he masses his materials, and arranges his facts in\r\n      successive groups, not according to chronological order, but to\r\n      their moral or political connection; the distinctness with which\r\n      he marks his periods of gradually increasing decay; and the skill\r\n      with which, though advancing on separate parallels of history, he\r\n      shows the common tendency of the slower or more rapid religious\r\n      or civil innovations. However these principles of composition may\r\n      demand more than ordinary attention on the part of the reader,\r\n      they can alone impress upon the memory the real course, and the\r\n      relative importance of the events. Whoever would justly\r\n      appreciate the superiority of Gibbon’s lucid arrangement, should\r\n      attempt to make his way through the regular but wearisome annals\r\n      of Tillemont, or even the less ponderous volumes of Le Beau. Both\r\n      these writers adhere, almost entirely, to chronological order;\r\n      the consequence is, that we are twenty times called upon to break\r\n      off, and resume the thread of six or eight wars in different\r\n      parts of the empire; to suspend the operations of a military\r\n      expedition for a court intrigue; to hurry away from a siege to a\r\n      council; and the same page places us in the middle of a campaign\r\n      against the barbarians, and in the depths of the Monophysite\r\n      controversy. In Gibbon it is not always easy to bear in mind the\r\n      exact dates but the course of events is ever clear and distinct;\r\n      like a skilful general, though his troops advance from the most\r\n      remote and opposite quarters, they are constantly bearing down\r\n      and concentrating themselves on one point—that which is still\r\n      occupied by the name, and by the waning power of Rome. Whether he\r\n      traces the progress of hostile religions, or leads from the\r\n      shores of the Baltic, or the verge of the Chinese empire, the\r\n      successive hosts of barbarians—though one wave has hardly burst\r\n      and discharged itself, before another swells up and\r\n      approaches—all is made to flow in the same direction, and the\r\n      impression which each makes upon the tottering fabric of the\r\n      Roman greatness, connects their distant movements, and measures\r\n      the relative importance assigned to them in the panoramic\r\n      history. The more peaceful and didactic episodes on the\r\n      development of the Roman law, or even on the details of\r\n      ecclesiastical history, interpose themselves as resting-places or\r\n      divisions between the periods of barbaric invasion. In short,\r\n      though distracted first by the two capitals, and afterwards by\r\n      the formal partition of the empire, the extraordinary felicity of\r\n      arrangement maintains an order and a regular progression. As our\r\n      horizon expands to reveal to us the gathering tempests which are\r\n      forming far beyond the boundaries of the civilized world—as we\r\n      follow their successive approach to the trembling frontier—the\r\n      compressed and receding line is still distinctly visible; though\r\n      gradually dismembered and the broken fragments assuming the form\r\n      of regular states and kingdoms, the real relation of those\r\n      kingdoms to the empire is maintained and defined; and even when\r\n      the Roman dominion has shrunk into little more than the province\r\n      of Thrace—when the name of Rome, confined, in Italy, to the walls\r\n      of the city—yet it is still the memory, the shade of the Roman\r\n      greatness, which extends over the wide sphere into which the\r\n      historian expands his later narrative; the whole blends into the\r\n      unity, and is manifestly essential to the double catastrophe of\r\n      his tragic drama.\r\n\r\n      But the amplitude, the magnificence, or the harmony of design,\r\n      are, though imposing, yet unworthy claims on our admiration,\r\n      unless the details are filled up with correctness and accuracy.\r\n      No writer has been more severely tried on this point than Gibbon.\r\n      He has undergone the triple scrutiny of theological zeal\r\n      quickened by just resentment, of literary emulation, and of that\r\n      mean and invidious vanity which delights in detecting errors in\r\n      writers of established fame. On the result of the trial, we may\r\n      be permitted to summon competent witnesses before we deliver our\r\n      own judgment.\r\n\r\n      M. Guizot, in his preface, after stating that in France and\r\n      Germany, as well as in England, in the most enlightened countries\r\n      of Europe, Gibbon is constantly cited as an authority, thus\r\n      proceeds:—\r\n\r\n      “I have had occasion, during my labors, to consult the writings\r\n      of philosophers, who have treated on the finances of the Roman\r\n      empire; of scholars, who have investigated the chronology; of\r\n      theologians, who have searched the depths of ecclesiastical\r\n      history; of writers on law, who have studied with care the Roman\r\n      jurisprudence; of Orientalists, who have occupied themselves with\r\n      the Arabians and the Koran; of modern historians, who have\r\n      entered upon extensive researches touching the crusades and their\r\n      influence; each of these writers has remarked and pointed out, in\r\n      the ‘History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,’ some\r\n      negligences, some false or imperfect views, some omissions, which\r\n      it is impossible not to suppose voluntary; they have rectified\r\n      some facts, combated with advantage some assertions; but in\r\n      general they have taken the researches and the ideas of Gibbon,\r\n      as points of departure, or as proofs of the researches or of the\r\n      new opinions which they have advanced.”\r\n\r\n      M. Guizot goes on to state his own impressions on reading\r\n      Gibbon’s history, and no authority will have greater weight with\r\n      those to whom the extent and accuracy of his historical\r\n      researches are known:—\r\n\r\n      “After a first rapid perusal, which allowed me to feel nothing\r\n      but the interest of a narrative, always animated, and,\r\n      notwithstanding its extent and the variety of objects which it\r\n      makes to pass before the view, always perspicuous, I entered upon\r\n      a minute examination of the details of which it was composed; and\r\n      the opinion which I then formed was, I confess, singularly\r\n      severe. I discovered, in certain chapters, errors which appeared\r\n      to me sufficiently important and numerous to make me believe that\r\n      they had been written with extreme negligence; in others, I was\r\n      struck with a certain tinge of partiality and prejudice, which\r\n      imparted to the exposition of the facts that want of truth and\r\n      justice, which the English express by their happy term\r\n      _misrepresentation_. Some imperfect (_tronquées_) quotations;\r\n      some passages, omitted unintentionally or designedly cast a\r\n      suspicion on the honesty (_bonne foi_) of the author; and his\r\n      violation of the first law of history—increased to my eye by the\r\n      prolonged attention with which I occupied myself with every\r\n      phrase, every note, every reflection—caused me to form upon the\r\n      whole work, a judgment far too rigorous. After having finished my\r\n      labors, I allowed some time to elapse before I reviewed the\r\n      whole. A second attentive and regular perusal of the entire work,\r\n      of the notes of the author, and of those which I had thought it\r\n      right to subjoin, showed me how much I had exaggerated the\r\n      importance of the reproaches which Gibbon really deserved; I was\r\n      struck with the same errors, the same partiality on certain\r\n      subjects; but I had been far from doing adequate justice to the\r\n      immensity of his researches, the variety of his knowledge, and\r\n      above all, to that truly philosophical discrimination (_justesse\r\n      d’esprit_) which judges the past as it would judge the present;\r\n      which does not permit itself to be blinded by the clouds which\r\n      time gathers around the dead, and which prevent us from seeing\r\n      that, under the toga, as under the modern dress, in the senate as\r\n      in our councils, men were what they still are, and that events\r\n      took place eighteen centuries ago, as they take place in our\r\n      days. I then felt that his book, in spite of its faults, will\r\n      always be a noble work—and that we may correct his errors and\r\n      combat his prejudices, without ceasing to admit that few men have\r\n      combined, if we are not to say in so high a degree, at least in a\r\n      manner so complete, and so well regulated, the necessary\r\n      qualifications for a writer of history.”\r\n\r\n      The present editor has followed the track of Gibbon through many\r\n      parts of his work; he has read his authorities with constant\r\n      reference to his pages, and must pronounce his deliberate\r\n      judgment, in terms of the highest admiration as to his general\r\n      accuracy. Many of his seeming errors are almost inevitable from\r\n      the close condensation of his matter. From the immense range of\r\n      his history, it was sometimes necessary to compress into a single\r\n      sentence, a whole vague and diffuse page of a Byzantine\r\n      chronicler. Perhaps something of importance may have thus\r\n      escaped, and his expressions may not quite contain the whole\r\n      substance of the passage from which they are taken. His limits,\r\n      at times, compel him to sketch; where that is the case, it is not\r\n      fair to expect the full details of the finished picture. At times\r\n      he can only deal with important results; and in his account of a\r\n      war, it sometimes requires great attention to discover that the\r\n      events which seem to be comprehended in a single campaign, occupy\r\n      several years. But this admirable skill in selecting and giving\r\n      prominence to the points which are of real weight and\r\n      importance—this distribution of light and shade—though perhaps it\r\n      may occasionally betray him into vague and imperfect statements,\r\n      is one of the highest excellencies of Gibbon’s historic manner.\r\n      It is the more striking, when we pass from the works of his chief\r\n      authorities, where, after laboring through long, minute, and\r\n      wearisome descriptions of the accessary and subordinate\r\n      circumstances, a single unmarked and undistinguished sentence,\r\n      which we may overlook from the inattention of fatigue, contains\r\n      the great moral and political result.\r\n\r\n      Gibbon’s method of arrangement, though on the whole most\r\n      favorable to the clear comprehension of the events, leads\r\n      likewise to apparent inaccuracy. That which we expect to find in\r\n      one part is reserved for another. The estimate which we are to\r\n      form, depends on the accurate balance of statements in remote\r\n      parts of the work; and we have sometimes to correct and modify\r\n      opinions, formed from one chapter by those of another. Yet, on\r\n      the other hand, it is astonishing how rarely we detect\r\n      contradiction; the mind of the author has already harmonized the\r\n      whole result to truth and probability; the general impression is\r\n      almost invariably the same. The quotations of Gibbon have\r\n      likewise been called in question;—I have, _in general_, been more\r\n      inclined to admire their exactitude, than to complain of their\r\n      indistinctness, or incompleteness. Where they are imperfect, it\r\n      is commonly from the study of brevity, and rather from the desire\r\n      of compressing the substance of his notes into pointed and\r\n      emphatic sentences, than from dishonesty, or uncandid suppression\r\n      of truth.\r\n\r\n      These observations apply more particularly to the accuracy and\r\n      fidelity of the historian as to his facts; his inferences, of\r\n      course, are more liable to exception. It is almost impossible to\r\n      trace the line between unfairness and unfaithfulness; between\r\n      intentional misrepresentation and undesigned false coloring. The\r\n      relative magnitude and importance of events must, in some\r\n      respect, depend upon the mind before which they are presented;\r\n      the estimate of character, on the habits and feelings of the\r\n      reader. Christians, like M. Guizot and ourselves, will see some\r\n      things, and some persons, in a different light from the historian\r\n      of the Decline and Fall. We may deplore the bias of his mind; we\r\n      may ourselves be on our guard against the danger of being misled,\r\n      and be anxious to warn less wary readers against the same perils;\r\n      but we must not confound this secret and unconscious departure\r\n      from truth, with the deliberate violation of that veracity which\r\n      is the only title of an historian to our confidence. Gibbon, it\r\n      may be fearlessly asserted, is rarely chargeable even with the\r\n      suppression of any material fact, which bears upon individual\r\n      character; he may, with apparently invidious hostility, enhance\r\n      the errors and crimes, and disparage the virtues of certain\r\n      persons; yet, in general, he leaves us the materials for forming\r\n      a fairer judgment; and if he is not exempt from his own\r\n      prejudices, perhaps we might write _passions_, yet it must be\r\n      candidly acknowledged, that his philosophical bigotry is not more\r\n      unjust than the theological partialities of those ecclesiastical\r\n      writers who were before in undisputed possession of this province\r\n      of history.\r\n\r\n      We are thus naturally led to that great misrepresentation which\r\n      pervades his history—his false estimate of the nature and\r\n      influence of Christianity.\r\n\r\n      But on this subject some preliminary caution is necessary, lest\r\n      that should be expected from a new edition, which it is\r\n      impossible that it should completely accomplish. We must first be\r\n      prepared with the only sound preservative against the false\r\n      impression likely to be produced by the perusal of Gibbon; and we\r\n      must see clearly the real cause of that false impression. The\r\n      former of these cautions will be briefly suggested in its proper\r\n      place, but it may be as well to state it, here, somewhat more at\r\n      length. The art of Gibbon, or at least the unfair impression\r\n      produced by his two memorable chapters, consists in his\r\n      confounding together, in one indistinguishable mass, the _origin_\r\n      and _apostolic_ propagation of the new religion, with its _later_\r\n      progress. No argument for the divine authority of Christianity\r\n      has been urged with greater force, or traced with higher\r\n      eloquence, than that deduced from its primary development,\r\n      explicable on no other hypothesis than a heavenly origin, and\r\n      from its rapid extension through great part of the Roman empire.\r\n      But this argument—one, when confined within reasonable limits, of\r\n      unanswerable force—becomes more feeble and disputable in\r\n      proportion as it recedes from the birthplace, as it were, of the\r\n      religion. The further Christianity advanced, the more causes\r\n      purely human were enlisted in its favor; nor can it be doubted\r\n      that those developed with such artful exclusiveness by Gibbon did\r\n      concur most essentially to its establishment. It is in the\r\n      Christian dispensation, as in the material world. In both it is\r\n      as the great First Cause, that the Deity is most undeniably\r\n      manifest. When once launched in regular motion upon the bosom of\r\n      space, and endowed with all their properties and relations of\r\n      weight and mutual attraction, the heavenly bodies appear to\r\n      pursue their courses according to secondary laws, which account\r\n      for all their sublime regularity. So Christianity proclaims its\r\n      Divine Author chiefly in its first origin and development. When\r\n      it had once received its impulse from above—when it had once been\r\n      infused into the minds of its first teachers—when it had gained\r\n      full possession of the reason and affections of the favored\r\n      few—it _might be_—and to the Protestant, the rationa Christian,\r\n      it is impossible to define _when_ it really _was_—left to make\r\n      its way by its native force, under the ordinary secret agencies\r\n      of all-ruling Providence. The main question, the _divine origin\r\n      of the religion_, was dexterously eluded, or speciously conceded\r\n      by Gibbon; his plan enabled him to commence his account, in most\r\n      parts, _below the apostolic times;_ and it was only by the\r\n      strength of the dark coloring with which he brought out the\r\n      failings and the follies of the succeeding ages, that a shadow of\r\n      doubt and suspicion was thrown back upon the primitive period of\r\n      Christianity.\r\n\r\n      “The theologian,” says Gibbon, “may indulge the pleasing task of\r\n      describing religion as she descended from heaven, arrayed in her\r\n      native purity; a more melancholy duty is imposed upon the\r\n      historian:—he must discover the inevitable mixture of error and\r\n      corruption which she contracted in a long residence upon earth\r\n      among a weak and degenerate race of beings.” Divest this passage\r\n      of the latent sarcasm betrayed by the subsequent tone of the\r\n      whole disquisition, and it might commence a Christian history\r\n      written in the most Christian spirit of candor. But as the\r\n      historian, by seeming to respect, yet by dexterously confounding\r\n      the limits of the sacred land, contrived to insinuate that it was\r\n      an Utopia which had no existence but in the imagination of the\r\n      theologian—as he _suggested_ rather than affirmed that the days\r\n      of Christian purity were a kind of poetic golden age;—so the\r\n      theologian, by venturing too far into the domain of the\r\n      historian, has been perpetually obliged to contest points on\r\n      which he had little chance of victory—to deny facts established\r\n      on unshaken evidence—and thence, to retire, if not with the shame\r\n      of defeat, yet with but doubtful and imperfect success. Paley,\r\n      with his intuitive sagacity, saw through the difficulty of\r\n      answering Gibbon by the ordinary arts of controversy; his\r\n      emphatic sentence, “Who can refute a sneer?” contains as much\r\n      truth as point. But full and pregnant as this phrase is, it is\r\n      not quite the whole truth; it is the tone in which the progress\r\n      of Christianity is traced, in _comparison_ with the rest of the\r\n      splendid and prodigally ornamented work, which is the radical\r\n      defect in the “Decline and Fall.” Christianity alone receives no\r\n      embellishment from the magic of Gibbon’s language; his\r\n      imagination is dead to its moral dignity; it is kept down by a\r\n      general zone of jealous disparagement, or neutralized by a\r\n      painfully elaborate exposition of its darker and degenerate\r\n      periods. There are occasions, indeed, when its pure and exalted\r\n      humanity, when its manifestly beneficial influence, can compel\r\n      even him, as it were, to fairness, and kindle his unguarded\r\n      eloquence to its usual fervor; but, in general, he soon relapses\r\n      into a frigid apathy; _affects_ an ostentatiously severe\r\n      impartiality; notes all the faults of Christians in every age\r\n      with bitter and almost malignant sarcasm; reluctantly, and with\r\n      exception and reservation, admits their claim to admiration. This\r\n      inextricable bias appears even to influence his manner of\r\n      composition. While all the other assailants of the Roman empire,\r\n      whether warlike or religious, the Goth, the Hun, the Arab, the\r\n      Tartar, Alaric and Attila, Mahomet, and Zengis, and Tamerlane,\r\n      are each introduced upon the scene almost with dramatic\r\n      animation—their progress related in a full, complete, and\r\n      unbroken narrative—the triumph of Christianity alone takes the\r\n      form of a cold and critical disquisition. The successes of\r\n      barbarous energy and brute force call forth all the consummate\r\n      skill of composition; while the moral triumphs of Christian\r\n      benevolence—the tranquil heroism of endurance, the blameless\r\n      purity, the contempt of guilty fame and of honors destructive to\r\n      the human race, which, had they assumed the proud name of\r\n      philosophy, would have been blazoned in his brightest words,\r\n      because they own religion as their principle—sink into narrow\r\n      asceticism. The _glories_ of Christianity, in short, touch on no\r\n      chord in the heart of the writer; his imagination remains\r\n      unkindled; his words, though they maintain their stately and\r\n      measured march, have become cool, argumentative, and inanimate.\r\n      Who would obscure one hue of that gorgeous coloring in which\r\n      Gibbon has invested the dying forms of Paganism, or darken one\r\n      paragraph in his splendid view of the rise and progress of\r\n      Mahometanism? But who would not have wished that the same equal\r\n      justice had been done to Christianity; that its real character\r\n      and deeply penetrating influence had been traced with the same\r\n      philosophical sagacity, and represented with more sober, as would\r\n      become its quiet course, and perhaps less picturesque, but still\r\n      with lively and attractive, descriptiveness? He might have thrown\r\n      aside, with the same scorn, the mass of ecclesiastical fiction\r\n      which envelops the early history of the church, stripped off the\r\n      legendary romance, and brought out the facts in their primitive\r\n      nakedness and simplicity—if he had but allowed those facts the\r\n      benefit of the glowing eloquence which he denied to them alone.\r\n      He might have annihilated the whole fabric of post-apostolic\r\n      miracles, if he had left uninjured by sarcastic insinuation those\r\n      of the New Testament; he might have cashiered, with Dodwell, the\r\n      whole host of martyrs, which owe their existence to the prodigal\r\n      invention of later days, had he but bestowed fair room, and dwelt\r\n      with his ordinary energy on the sufferings of the genuine\r\n      witnesses to the truth of Christianity, the Polycarps, or the\r\n      martyrs of Vienne. And indeed, if, after all, the view of the\r\n      early progress of Christianity be melancholy and humiliating we\r\n      must beware lest we charge the whole of this on the infidelity of\r\n      the historian. It is idle, it is disingenuous, to deny or to\r\n      dissemble the early depravations of Christianity, its gradual but\r\n      rapid departure from its primitive simplicity and purity, still\r\n      more, from its spirit of universal love. It may be no unsalutary\r\n      lesson to the Christian world, that this silent, this\r\n      unavoidable, perhaps, yet fatal change shall have been drawn by\r\n      an impartial, or even an hostile hand. The Christianity of every\r\n      age may take warning, lest by its own narrow views, its want of\r\n      wisdom, and its want of charity, it give the same advantage to\r\n      the future unfriendly historian, and disparage the cause of true\r\n      religion.\r\n\r\n      The design of the present edition is partly corrective, partly\r\n      supplementary: corrective, by notes, which point out (it is\r\n      hoped, in a perfectly candid and dispassionate spirit with no\r\n      desire but to establish the truth) such inaccuracies or\r\n      misstatements as may have been detected, particularly with regard\r\n      to Christianity; and which thus, with the previous caution, may\r\n      counteract to a considerable extent the unfair and unfavorable\r\n      impression created against rational religion: supplementary, by\r\n      adding such additional information as the editor’s reading may\r\n      have been able to furnish, from original documents or books, not\r\n      accessible at the time when Gibbon wrote.\r\n\r\n      The work originated in the editor’s habit of noting on the margin\r\n      of his copy of Gibbon references to such authors as had\r\n      discovered errors, or thrown new light on the subjects treated by\r\n      Gibbon. These had grown to some extent, and seemed to him likely\r\n      to be of use to others. The annotations of M. Guizot also\r\n      appeared to him worthy of being better known to the English\r\n      public than they were likely to be, as appended to the French\r\n      translation.\r\n\r\n      The chief works from which the editor has derived his materials\r\n      are, I. The French translation, with notes by M. Guizot; 2d\r\n      edition, Paris, 1828. The editor has translated almost all the\r\n      notes of M. Guizot. Where he has not altogether agreed with him,\r\n      his respect for the learning and judgment of that writer has, in\r\n      general, induced him to retain the statement from which he has\r\n      ventured to differ, with the grounds on which he formed his own\r\n      opinion. In the notes on Christianity, he has retained all those\r\n      of M. Guizot, with his own, from the conviction, that on such a\r\n      subject, to many, the authority of a French statesman, a\r\n      Protestant, and a rational and sincere Christian, would appear\r\n      more independent and unbiassed, and therefore be more commanding,\r\n      than that of an English clergyman.\r\n\r\n      The editor has not scrupled to transfer the notes of M. Guizot to\r\n      the present work. The well-known zeal for knowledge, displayed in\r\n      all the writings of that distinguished historian, has led to the\r\n      natural inference, that he would not be displeased at the attempt\r\n      to make them of use to the English readers of Gibbon. The notes\r\n      of M. Guizot are signed with the letter G.\r\n\r\n      II. The German translation, with the notes of Wenck.\r\n      Unfortunately this learned translator died, after having\r\n      completed only the first volume; the rest of the work was\r\n      executed by a very inferior hand.\r\n\r\n      The notes of Wenck are extremely valuable; many of them have been\r\n      adopted by M. Guizot; they are distinguished by the letter W. 102\r\n\r\n      102 (return) [ The editor regrets that he has not been able to\r\n      find the Italian translation, mentioned by Gibbon himself with\r\n      some respect. It is not in our great libraries, the Museum or the\r\n      Bodleian; and he has never found any bookseller in London who has\r\n      seen it.]\r\n\r\n      III. The new edition of Le Beau’s “Histoire du Bas Empire, with\r\n      notes by M. St. Martin, and M. Brosset.” That distinguished\r\n      Armenian scholar, M. St. Martin (now, unhappily, deceased) had\r\n      added much information from Oriental writers, particularly from\r\n      those of Armenia, as well as from more general sources. Many of\r\n      his observations have been found as applicable to the work of\r\n      Gibbon as to that of Le Beau.\r\n\r\n      IV. The editor has consulted the various answers made to Gibbon\r\n      on the first appearance of his work; he must confess, with little\r\n      profit. They were, in general, hastily compiled by inferior and\r\n      now forgotten writers, with the exception of Bishop Watson, whose\r\n      able apology is rather a general argument, than an examination of\r\n      misstatements. The name of Milner stands higher with a certain\r\n      class of readers, but will not carry much weight with the severe\r\n      investigator of history.\r\n\r\n      V. Some few classical works and fragments have come to light,\r\n      since the appearance of Gibbon’s History, and have been noticed\r\n      in their respective places; and much use has been made, in the\r\n      latter volumes particularly, of the increase to our stores of\r\n      Oriental literature. The editor cannot, indeed, pretend to have\r\n      followed his author, in these gleanings, over the whole vast\r\n      field of his inquiries; he may have overlooked or may not have\r\n      been able to command some works, which might have thrown still\r\n      further light on these subjects; but he trusts that what he has\r\n      adduced will be of use to the student of historic truth.\r\n\r\n      The editor would further observe, that with regard to some other\r\n      objectionable passages, which do not involve misstatement or\r\n      inaccuracy, he has intentionally abstained from directing\r\n      particular attention towards them by any special protest.\r\n\r\n      The editor’s notes are marked M.\r\n\r\n      A considerable part of the quotations (some of which in the later\r\n      editions had fallen into great confusion) have been verified, and\r\n      have been corrected by the latest and best editions of the\r\n      authors.\r\n\r\n      June, 1845.\r\n\r\n      In this new edition, the text and the notes have been carefully\r\n      revised, the latter by the editor.\r\n\r\n      Some additional notes have been subjoined, distinguished by the\r\n      signature M. 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Preface Of The Author.\r\n\r\n\r\n      It is not my intention to detain the reader by expatiating on the\r\n      variety or the importance of the subject, which I have undertaken\r\n      to treat; since the merit of the choice would serve to render the\r\n      weakness of the execution still more apparent, and still less\r\n      excusable. But as I have presumed to lay before the public a\r\n      _first_ volume only 1 of the History of the Decline and Fall of\r\n      the Roman Empire, it will, perhaps, be expected that I should\r\n      explain, in a few words, the nature and limits of my general\r\n      plan.\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ The first volume of the quarto, which contained the\r\n      sixteen first chapters.]\r\n\r\n      The memorable series of revolutions, which in the course of about\r\n      thirteen centuries gradually undermined, and at length destroyed,\r\n      the solid fabric of human greatness, may, with some propriety, be\r\n      divided into the three following periods:\r\n\r\n      I. The first of these periods may be traced from the age of\r\n      Trajan and the Antonines, when the Roman monarchy, having\r\n      attained its full strength and maturity, began to verge towards\r\n      its decline; and will extend to the subversion of the Western\r\n      Empire, by the barbarians of Germany and Scythia, the rude\r\n      ancestors of the most polished nations of modern Europe. This\r\n      extraordinary revolution, which subjected Rome to the power of a\r\n      Gothic conqueror, was completed about the beginning of the sixth\r\n      century.\r\n\r\n      II. The second period of the Decline and Fall of Rome may be\r\n      supposed to commence with the reign of Justinian, who, by his\r\n      laws, as well as by his victories, restored a transient splendor\r\n      to the Eastern Empire. It will comprehend the invasion of Italy\r\n      by the Lombards; the conquest of the Asiatic and African\r\n      provinces by the Arabs, who embraced the religion of Mahomet; the\r\n      revolt of the Roman people against the feeble princes of\r\n      Constantinople; and the elevation of Charlemagne, who, in the\r\n      year eight hundred, established the second, or German Empire of\r\n      the West.\r\n\r\n      III. The last and longest of these periods includes about six\r\n      centuries and a half; from the revival of the Western Empire,\r\n      till the taking of Constantinople by the Turks, and the\r\n      extinction of a degenerate race of princes, who continued to\r\n      assume the titles of Cæsar and Augustus, after their dominions\r\n      were contracted to the limits of a single city; in which the\r\n      language, as well as manners, of the ancient Romans, had been\r\n      long since forgotten. The writer who should undertake to relate\r\n      the events of this period, would find himself obliged to enter\r\n      into the general history of the Crusades, as far as they\r\n      contributed to the ruin of the Greek Empire; and he would\r\n      scarcely be able to restrain his curiosity from making some\r\n      inquiry into the state of the city of Rome, during the darkness\r\n      and confusion of the middle ages.\r\n\r\n      As I have ventured, perhaps too hastily, to commit to the press a\r\n      work which in every sense of the word, deserves the epithet of\r\n      imperfect. I consider myself as contracting an engagement to\r\n      finish, most probably in a second volume, 2a the first of these\r\n      memorable periods; and to deliver to the Public the complete\r\n      History of the Decline and Fall of Rome, from the age of the\r\n      Antonines to the subversion of the Western Empire. With regard to\r\n      the subsequent periods, though I may entertain some hopes, I dare\r\n      not presume to give any assurances. The execution of the\r\n      extensive plan which I have described, would connect the ancient\r\n      and modern history of the world; but it would require many years\r\n      of health, of leisure, and of perseverance.\r\n\r\n      2a (return) [ The Author, as it frequently happens, took an\r\n      inadequate measure of his growing work.

S. The entire History, which is now published, of the Decline\r\n      and Fall of the Roman Empire in the West, abundantly discharges\r\n      my engagements with the Public. Perhaps their favorable opinion\r\n      may encourage me to prosecute a work, which, however laborious it\r\n      may seem, is the most agreeable occupation of my leisure hours.\r\n\r\n      BENTINCK STREET, _March_ 1, 1781.\r\n\r\n      An Author easily persuades himself that the public opinion is\r\n      still favorable to his labors; and I have now embraced the\r\n      serious resolution of proceeding to the last period of my\r\n      original design, and of the Roman Empire, the taking of\r\n      Constantinople by the Turks, in the year one thousand four\r\n      hundred and fifty-three. The most patient Reader, who computes\r\n      that three ponderous 3 volumes have been already employed on the\r\n      events of four centuries, may, perhaps, be alarmed at the long\r\n      prospect of nine hundred years. But it is not my intention to\r\n      expatiate with the same minuteness on the whole series of the\r\n      Byzantine history. At our entrance into this period, the reign of\r\n      Justinian, and the conquests of the Mahometans, will deserve and\r\n      detain our attention, and the last age of Constantinople (the\r\n      Crusades and the Turks) is connected with the revolutions of\r\n      Modern Europe. From the seventh to the eleventh century, the\r\n      obscure interval will be supplied by a concise narrative of such\r\n      facts as may still appear either interesting or important.\r\n\r\n      BENTINCK STREET, _March_ 1, 1782.\r\n\r\n      3 (return) [ The first six volumes of the octavo edition.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Preface To The First Volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Diligence and accuracy are the only merits which an historical\r\n      writer may ascribe to himself; if any merit, indeed, can be\r\n      assumed from the performance of an indispensable duty. I may\r\n      therefore be allowed to say, that I have carefully examined all\r\n      the original materials that could illustrate the subject which I\r\n      had undertaken to treat. Should I ever complete the extensive\r\n      design which has been sketched out in the Preface, I might\r\n      perhaps conclude it with a critical account of the authors\r\n      consulted during the progress of the whole work; and however such\r\n      an attempt might incur the censure of ostentation, I am persuaded\r\n      that it would be susceptible of entertainment, as well as\r\n      information.\r\n\r\n      At present I shall content myself with a single observation.\r\n\r\n      The biographers, who, under the reigns of Diocletian and\r\n      Constantine, composed, or rather compiled, the lives of the\r\n      Emperors, from Hadrian to the sons of Carus, are usually\r\n      mentioned under the names of Ælius Spartianus, Julius\r\n      Capitolinus, Ælius Lampridius, Vulcatius Gallicanus, Trebellius\r\n      Pollio and Flavius Vopiscus. But there is so much perplexity in\r\n      the titles of the MSS., and so many disputes have arisen among\r\n      the critics (see Fabricius, Biblioth. Latin. l. iii. c. 6)\r\n      concerning their number, their names, and their respective\r\n      property, that for the most part I have quoted them without\r\n      distinction, under the general and well-known title of the\r\n      _Augustan History_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Preface To The Fourth Volume Of The Original Quarto Edition.\r\n\r\n      I now discharge my promise, and complete my design, of writing\r\n      the History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, both in\r\n      the West and the East. The whole period extends from the age of\r\n      Trajan and the Antonines, to the taking of Constantinople by\r\n      Mahomet the Second; and includes a review of the Crusades, and\r\n      the state of Rome during the middle ages. Since the publication\r\n      of the first volume, twelve years have elapsed; twelve years,\r\n      according to my wish, “of health, of leisure, and of\r\n      perseverance.” I may now congratulate my deliverance from a long\r\n      and laborious service, and my satisfaction will be pure and\r\n      perfect, if the public favor should be extended to the conclusion\r\n      of my work.\r\n\r\n      It was my first intention to have collected, under one view, the\r\n      numerous authors, of every age and language, from whom I have\r\n      derived the materials of this history; and I am still convinced\r\n      that the apparent ostentation would be more than compensated by\r\n      real use. If I have renounced this idea, if I have declined an\r\n      undertaking which had obtained the approbation of a\r\n      master-artist,4 my excuse may be found in the extreme difficulty\r\n      of assigning a proper measure to such a catalogue. A naked list\r\n      of names and editions would not be satisfactory either to myself\r\n      or my readers: the characters of the principal Authors of the\r\n      Roman and Byzantine History have been occasionally connected with\r\n      the events which they describe; a more copious and critical\r\n      inquiry might indeed deserve, but it would demand, an elaborate\r\n      volume, which might swell by degrees into a general library of\r\n      historical writers. For the present, I shall content myself with\r\n      renewing my serious protestation, that I have always endeavored\r\n      to draw from the fountain-head; that my curiosity, as well as a\r\n      sense of duty, has always urged me to study the originals; and\r\n      that, if they have sometimes eluded my search, I have carefully\r\n      marked the secondary evidence, on whose faith a passage or a fact\r\n      were reduced to depend.\r\n\r\n      4 (return) [ See Dr. Robertson’s Preface to his History of\r\n      America.]\r\n\r\n      I shall soon revisit the banks of the Lake of Lausanne, a country\r\n      which I have known and loved from my early youth. Under a mild\r\n      government, amidst a beauteous landscape, in a life of leisure\r\n      and independence, and among a people of easy and elegant manners,\r\n      I have enjoyed, and may again hope to enjoy, the varied pleasures\r\n      of retirement and society. But I shall ever glory in the name and\r\n      character of an Englishman: I am proud of my birth in a free and\r\n      enlightened country; and the approbation of that country is the\r\n      best and most honorable reward of my labors. Were I ambitious of\r\n      any other Patron than the Public, I would inscribe this work to a\r\n      Statesman, who, in a long, a stormy, and at length an unfortunate\r\n      administration, had many political opponents, almost without a\r\n      personal enemy; who has retained, in his fall from power, many\r\n      faithful and disinterested friends; and who, under the pressure\r\n      of severe infirmity, enjoys the lively vigor of his mind, and the\r\n      felicity of his incomparable temper. Lord North will permit me to\r\n      express the feelings of friendship in the language of truth: but\r\n      even truth and friendship should be silent, if he still dispensed\r\n      the favors of the crown.\r\n\r\n      In a remote solitude, vanity may still whisper in my ear, that my\r\n      readers, perhaps, may inquire whether, in the conclusion of the\r\n      present work, I am now taking an everlasting farewell. They shall\r\n      hear all that I know myself, and all that I could reveal to the\r\n      most intimate friend. The motives of action or silence are now\r\n      equally balanced; nor can I pronounce, in my most secret\r\n      thoughts, on which side the scale will preponderate. I cannot\r\n      dissemble that six quartos must have tried, and may have\r\n      exhausted, the indulgence of the Public; that, in the repetition\r\n      of similar attempts, a successful Author has much more to lose\r\n      than he can hope to gain; that I am now descending into the vale\r\n      of years; and that the most respectable of my countrymen, the men\r\n      whom I aspire to imitate, have resigned the pen of history about\r\n      the same period of their lives. Yet I consider that the annals of\r\n      ancient and modern times may afford many rich and interesting\r\n      subjects; that I am still possessed of health and leisure; that\r\n      by the practice of writing, some skill and facility must be\r\n      acquired; and that, in the ardent pursuit of truth and knowledge,\r\n      I am not conscious of decay. To an active mind, indolence is more\r\n      painful than labor; and the first months of my liberty will be\r\n      occupied and amused in the excursions of curiosity and taste. By\r\n      such temptations, I have been sometimes seduced from the rigid\r\n      duty even of a pleasing and voluntary task: but my time will now\r\n      be my own; and in the use or abuse of independence, I shall no\r\n      longer fear my own reproaches or those of my friends. I am fairly\r\n      entitled to a year of jubilee: next summer and the following\r\n      winter will rapidly pass away; and experience only can determine\r\n      whether I shall still prefer the freedom and variety of study to\r\n      the design and composition of a regular work, which animates,\r\n      while it confines, the daily application of the Author.\r\n\r\n      Caprice and accident may influence my choice; but the dexterity\r\n      of self-love will contrive to applaud either active industry or\r\n      philosophic repose.\r\n\r\n      DOWNING STREET, _May_ 1, 1788.\r\n\r\n      P. S. I shall embrace this opportunity of introducing two\r\n      _verbal_ remarks, which have not conveniently offered themselves\r\n      to my notice. 1. As often as I use the definitions of _beyond_\r\n      the Alps, the Rhine, the Danube, &c., I generally suppose myself\r\n      at Rome, and afterwards at Constantinople; without observing\r\n      whether this relative geography may agree with the local, but\r\n      variable, situation of the reader, or the historian. 2. In proper\r\n      names of foreign, and especially of Oriental origin, it should be\r\n      always our aim to express, in our English version, a faithful\r\n      copy of the original. But this rule, which is founded on a just\r\n      regard to uniformity and truth, must often be relaxed; and the\r\n      exceptions will be limited or enlarged by the custom of the\r\n      language and the taste of the interpreter. Our alphabets may be\r\n      often defective; a harsh sound, an uncouth spelling, might offend\r\n      the ear or the eye of our countrymen; and some words, notoriously\r\n      corrupt, are fixed, and, as it were, naturalized in the vulgar\r\n      tongue. The prophet _Mohammed_ can no longer be stripped of the\r\n      famous, though improper, appellation of Mahomet: the well-known\r\n      cities of Aleppo, Damascus, and Cairo, would almost be lost in\r\n      the strange descriptions of _Haleb, Demashk_, and _Al Cahira:_\r\n      the titles and offices of the Ottoman empire are fashioned by the\r\n      practice of three hundred years; and we are pleased to blend the\r\n      three Chinese monosyllables, _Con-fû-tzee_, in the respectable\r\n      name of Confucius, or even to adopt the Portuguese corruption of\r\n      Mandarin. But I would vary the use of Zoroaster and _Zerdusht_,\r\n      as I drew my information from Greece or Persia: since our\r\n      connection with India, the genuine _Timour_ is restored to the\r\n      throne of Tamerlane: our most correct writers have retrenched the\r\n      _Al_, the superfluous article, from the Koran; and we escape an\r\n      ambiguous termination, by adopting _Moslem_ instead of Musulman,\r\n      in the plural number. In these, and in a thousand examples, the\r\n      shades of distinction are often minute; and I can feel, where I\r\n      cannot explain, the motives of my choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter I: The Extent Of The Empire In The Age Of The\r\n      Antonines—Part I.\r\n\r\n      Introduction.\r\n\r\n     The Extent And Military Force Of The Empire In The Age Of The\r\n     Antonines.\r\n\r\n      In the second century of the Christian Æra, the empire of Rome\r\n      comprehended the fairest part of the earth, and the most\r\n      civilized portion of mankind. The frontiers of that extensive\r\n      monarchy were guarded by ancient renown and disciplined valor.\r\n      The gentle but powerful influence of laws and manners had\r\n      gradually cemented the union of the provinces. Their peaceful\r\n      inhabitants enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth and\r\n      luxury. The image of a free constitution was preserved with\r\n      decent reverence: the Roman senate appeared to possess the\r\n      sovereign authority, and devolved on the emperors all the\r\n      executive powers of government. During a happy period of more\r\n      than fourscore years, the public administration was conducted by\r\n      the virtue and abilities of Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the two\r\n      Antonines. It is the design of this, and of the two succeeding\r\n      chapters, to describe the prosperous condition of their empire;\r\n      and afterwards, from the death of Marcus Antoninus, to deduce the\r\n      most important circumstances of its decline and fall; a\r\n      revolution which will ever be remembered, and is still felt by\r\n      the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\n      The principal conquests of the Romans were achieved under the\r\n      republic; and the emperors, for the most part, were satisfied\r\n      with preserving those dominions which had been acquired by the\r\n      policy of the senate, the active emulations of the consuls, and\r\n      the martial enthusiasm of the people. The seven first centuries\r\n      were filled with a rapid succession of triumphs; but it was\r\n      reserved for Augustus to relinquish the ambitious design of\r\n      subduing the whole earth, and to introduce a spirit of moderation\r\n      into the public councils. Inclined to peace by his temper and\r\n      situation, it was easy for him to discover that Rome, in her\r\n      present exalted situation, had much less to hope than to fear\r\n      from the chance of arms; and that, in the prosecution of remote\r\n      wars, the undertaking became every day more difficult, the event\r\n      more doubtful, and the possession more precarious, and less\r\n      beneficial. The experience of Augustus added weight to these\r\n      salutary reflections, and effectually convinced him that, by the\r\n      prudent vigor of his counsels, it would be easy to secure every\r\n      concession which the safety or the dignity of Rome might require\r\n      from the most formidable barbarians. Instead of exposing his\r\n      person and his legions to the arrows of the Parthians, he\r\n      obtained, by an honorable treaty, the restitution of the\r\n      standards and prisoners which had been taken in the defeat of\r\n      Crassus. 1a\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ Dion Cassius, (l. liv. p. 736,) with the annotations\r\n      of Reimar, who has collected all that Roman vanity has left upon\r\n      the subject.

They marched near a\r\n      thousand miles to the south of the tropic; but the heat of the\r\n      climate soon repelled the invaders, and protected the un-warlike\r\n      natives of those sequestered regions. 2c The northern countries\r\n      of Europe scarcely deserved the expense and labor of conquest.\r\n      The forests and morasses of Germany were filled with a hardy race\r\n      of barbarians, who despised life when it was separated from\r\n      freedom; and though, on the first attack, they seemed to yield to\r\n      the weight of the Roman power, they soon, by a signal act of\r\n      despair, regained their independence, and reminded Augustus of\r\n      the vicissitude of fortune. 3a On the death of that emperor, his\r\n      testament was publicly read in the senate. He bequeathed, as a\r\n      valuable legacy to his successors, the advice of confining the\r\n      empire within those limits which nature seemed to have placed as\r\n      its permanent bulwarks and boundaries: on the west, the Atlantic\r\n      Ocean; the Rhine and Danube on the north; the Euphrates on the\r\n      east; and towards the south, the sandy deserts of Arabia and\r\n      Africa. 4a\r\n\r\n      2c (return) [ Strabo, (l. xvi. p. 780,) Pliny the elder, (Hist.\r\n      Natur. l. vi. c. 32, 35, [28, 29,]) and Dion Cassius, (l. liii.\r\n      p. 723, and l. liv. p. 734,) have left us very curious details\r\n      concerning these wars. The Romans made themselves masters of\r\n      Mariaba, or Merab, a city of Arabia Felix, well known to the\r\n      Orientals. (See Abulfeda and the Nubian geography, p. 52) They\r\n      were arrived within three days’ journey of the spice country, the\r\n      rich object of their invasion.\r\n\r\n      Note: It is this city of Merab that the Arabs say was the\r\n      residence of Belkis, queen of Saba, who desired to see Solomon. A\r\n      dam, by which the waters collected in its neighborhood were kept\r\n      back, having been swept away, the sudden inundation destroyed\r\n      this city, of which, nevertheless, vestiges remain. It bordered\r\n      on a country called Adramout, where a particular aromatic plant\r\n      grows: it is for this reason that we real in the history of the\r\n      Roman expedition, that they were arrived within three days’\r\n      journey of the spice country.—G. Compare _Malte-Brun, Geogr_.\r\n      Eng. trans. vol. ii. p. 215.

The detailed account of Strabo\r\n      makes the invaders fail before Marsuabæ this cannot be the same\r\n      place as Mariaba. Ukert observes, that Ælius Gallus would not\r\n      have failed for want of water before Mariaba. (See M. Guizot’s\r\n      note above.) “Either, therefore, they were different places, or\r\n      Strabo is mistaken.” (Ukert, _Geographie der Griechen und Römer_,\r\n      vol. i. p. 181.) Strabo, indeed, mentions Mariaba distinct from\r\n      Marsuabæ. Gibbon has followed Pliny in reckoning Mariaba among\r\n      the conquests of Gallus. There can be little doubt that he is\r\n      wrong, as Gallus did not approach the capital of Sabæa.

Spanheim.]\r\n\r\n      Happily for the repose of mankind, the moderate system\r\n      recommended by the wisdom of Augustus, was adopted by the fears\r\n      and vices of his immediate successors. Engaged in the pursuit of\r\n      pleasure, or in the exercise of tyranny, the first Cæsars seldom\r\n      showed themselves to the armies, or to the provinces; nor were\r\n      they disposed to suffer, that those triumphs which _their_\r\n      indolence neglected, should be usurped by the conduct and valor\r\n      of their lieutenants. The military fame of a subject was\r\n      considered as an insolent invasion of the Imperial prerogative;\r\n      and it became the duty, as well as interest, of every Roman\r\n      general, to guard the frontiers intrusted to his care, without\r\n      aspiring to conquests which might have proved no less fatal to\r\n      himself than to the vanquished barbarians. 5\r\n\r\n      5 (return) [ Germanicus, Suetonius Paulinus, and Agricola were\r\n      checked and recalled in the course of their victories.

The proximity of its situation to the\r\n      coast of Gaul seemed to invite their arms; the pleasing though\r\n      doubtful intelligence of a pearl fishery attracted their avarice;\r\n      6 and as Britain was viewed in the light of a distinct and\r\n      insulated world, the conquest scarcely formed any exception to\r\n      the general system of continental measures. After a war of about\r\n      forty years, undertaken by the most stupid, 7 maintained by the\r\n      most dissolute, and terminated by the most timid of all the\r\n      emperors, the far greater part of the island submitted to the\r\n      Roman yoke. 8 The various tribes of Britain possessed valor\r\n      without conduct, and the love of freedom without the spirit of\r\n      union. They took up arms with savage fierceness; they laid them\r\n      down, or turned them against each other, with wild inconsistency;\r\n      and while they fought singly, they were successively subdued.\r\n      Neither the fortitude of Caractacus, nor the despair of Boadicea,\r\n      nor the fanaticism of the Druids, could avert the slavery of\r\n      their country, or resist the steady progress of the Imperial\r\n      generals, who maintained the national glory, when the throne was\r\n      disgraced by the weakest, or the most vicious of mankind. At the\r\n      very time when Domitian, confined to his palace, felt the terrors\r\n      which he inspired, his legions, under the command of the virtuous\r\n      Agricola, defeated the collected force of the Caledonians, at the\r\n      foot of the Grampian Hills; and his fleets, venturing to explore\r\n      an unknown and dangerous navigation, displayed the Roman arms\r\n      round every part of the island. The conquest of Britain was\r\n      considered as already achieved; and it was the design of Agricola\r\n      to complete and insure his success, by the easy reduction of\r\n      Ireland, for which, in his opinion, one legion and a few\r\n      auxiliaries were sufficient. 9 The western isle might be improved\r\n      into a valuable possession, and the Britons would wear their\r\n      chains with the less reluctance, if the prospect and example of\r\n      freedom were on every side removed from before their eyes.\r\n\r\n      6 (return) [ Cæsar himself conceals that ignoble motive; but it\r\n      is mentioned by Suetonius, c. 47.

Before his\r\n      departure, the prudent general had provided for security as well\r\n      as for dominion. He had observed, that the island is almost\r\n      divided into two unequal parts by the opposite gulfs, or, as they\r\n      are now called, the Friths of Scotland. Across the narrow\r\n      interval of about forty miles, he had drawn a line of military\r\n      stations, which was afterwards fortified, in the reign of\r\n      Antoninus Pius, by a turf rampart, erected on foundations of\r\n      stone. 10 This wall of Antoninus, at a small distance beyond the\r\n      modern cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, was fixed as the limit of\r\n      the Roman province. The native Caledonians preserved, in the\r\n      northern extremity of the island, their wild independence, for\r\n      which they were not less indebted to their poverty than to their\r\n      valor. Their incursions were frequently repelled and chastised;\r\n      but their country was never subdued. 11 The masters of the\r\n      fairest and most wealthy climates of the globe turned with\r\n      contempt from gloomy hills, assailed by the winter tempest, from\r\n      lakes concealed in a blue mist, and from cold and lonely heaths,\r\n      over which the deer of the forest were chased by a troop of naked\r\n      barbarians. 12\r\n\r\n      10 (return) [ See Horsley’s Britannia Romana, l. i. c. 10.

That virtuous and active prince had received the\r\n      education of a soldier, and possessed the talents of a general.\r\n      13 The peaceful system of his predecessors was interrupted by\r\n      scenes of war and conquest; and the legions, after a long\r\n      interval, beheld a military emperor at their head. The first\r\n      exploits of Trajan were against the Dacians, the most warlike of\r\n      men, who dwelt beyond the Danube, and who, during the reign of\r\n      Domitian, had insulted, with impunity, the Majesty of Rome. 14 To\r\n      the strength and fierceness of barbarians they added a contempt\r\n      for life, which was derived from a warm persuasion of the\r\n      immortality and transmigration of the soul. 15 Decebalus, the\r\n      Dacian king, approved himself a rival not unworthy of Trajan; nor\r\n      did he despair of his own and the public fortune, till, by the\r\n      confession of his enemies, he had exhausted every resource both\r\n      of valor and policy. 16 This memorable war, with a very short\r\n      suspension of hostilities, lasted five years; and as the emperor\r\n      could exert, without control, the whole force of the state, it\r\n      was terminated by an absolute submission of the barbarians. 17\r\n      The new province of Dacia, which formed a second exception to the\r\n      precept of Augustus, was about thirteen hundred miles in\r\n      circumference. Its natural boundaries were the Niester, the Teyss\r\n      or Tibiscus, the Lower Danube, and the Euxine Sea.

The praises of\r\n      Alexander, transmitted by a succession of poets and historians,\r\n      had kindled a dangerous emulation in the mind of Trajan. Like\r\n      him, the Roman emperor undertook an expedition against the\r\n      nations of the East; but he lamented with a sigh, that his\r\n      advanced age scarcely left him any hopes of equalling the renown\r\n      of the son of Philip. 19 Yet the success of Trajan, however\r\n      transient, was rapid and specious. The degenerate Parthians,\r\n      broken by intestine discord, fled before his arms. He descended\r\n      the River Tigris in triumph, from the mountains of Armenia to the\r\n      Persian Gulf. He enjoyed the honor of being the first, as he was\r\n      the last, of the Roman generals, who ever navigated that remote\r\n      sea. His fleets ravaged the coast of Arabia; and Trajan vainly\r\n      flattered himself that he was approaching towards the confines of\r\n      India. 20 Every day the astonished senate received the\r\n      intelligence of new names and new nations, that acknowledged his\r\n      sway. They were informed that the kings of Bosphorus, Colchos,\r\n      Iberia, Albania, Osrhoene, and even the Parthian monarch himself,\r\n      had accepted their diadems from the hands of the emperor; that\r\n      the independent tribes of the Median and Carduchian hills had\r\n      implored his protection; and that the rich countries of Armenia,\r\n      Mesopotamia, and Assyria, were reduced into the state of\r\n      provinces. 21 But the death of Trajan soon clouded the splendid\r\n      prospect; and it was justly to be dreaded, that so many distant\r\n      nations would throw off the unaccustomed yoke, when they were no\r\n      longer restrained by the powerful hand which had imposed it.\r\n\r\n      19 (return) [ Trajan’s sentiments are represented in a very just\r\n      and lively manner in the Cæsars of Julian.]\r\n\r\n      20 (return) [ Eutropius and Sextus Rufus have endeavored to\r\n      perpetuate the illusion.

A favorable\r\n      inference was drawn from his obstinacy, which was interpreted by\r\n      the augurs as a sure presage that the boundaries of the Roman\r\n      power would never recede. 22 During many ages, the prediction, as\r\n      it is usual, contributed to its own accomplishment. But though\r\n      Terminus had resisted the Majesty of Jupiter, he submitted to the\r\n      authority of the emperor Hadrian. 23 The resignation of all the\r\n      eastern conquests of Trajan was the first measure of his reign.\r\n      He restored to the Parthians the election of an independent\r\n      sovereign; withdrew the Roman garrisons from the provinces of\r\n      Armenia, Mesopotamia, and Assyria; and, in compliance with the\r\n      precept of Augustus, once more established the Euphrates as the\r\n      frontier of the empire. 24 Censure, which arraigns the public\r\n      actions and the private motives of princes, has ascribed to envy,\r\n      a conduct which might be attributed to the prudence and\r\n      moderation of Hadrian. The various character of that emperor,\r\n      capable, by turns, of the meanest and the most generous\r\n      sentiments, may afford some color to the suspicion. It was,\r\n      however, scarcely in his power to place the superiority of his\r\n      predecessor in a more conspicuous light, than by thus confessing\r\n      himself unequal to the task of defending the conquests of Trajan.\r\n\r\n      22 (return) [ Ovid.

They persisted in\r\n      the design of maintaining the dignity of the empire, without\r\n      attempting to enlarge its limits. By every honorable expedient\r\n      they invited the friendship of the barbarians; and endeavored to\r\n      convince mankind that the Roman power, raised above the\r\n      temptation of conquest, was actuated only by the love of order\r\n      and justice. During a long period of forty-three years, their\r\n      virtuous labors were crowned with success; and if we except a few\r\n      slight hostilities, that served to exercise the legions of the\r\n      frontier, the reigns of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius offer the fair\r\n      prospect of universal peace. 27 The Roman name was revered among\r\n      the most remote nations of the earth.

But in\r\n      proportion as the public freedom was lost in extent of conquest,\r\n      war was gradually improved into an art, and degraded into a\r\n      trade. 30 The legions themselves, even at the time when they were\r\n      recruited in the most distant provinces, were supposed to consist\r\n      of Roman citizens. That distinction was generally considered,\r\n      either as a legal qualification or as a proper recompense for the\r\n      soldier; but a more serious regard was paid to the essential\r\n      merit of age, strength, and military stature. 31 In all levies, a\r\n      just preference was given to the climates of the North over those\r\n      of the South: the race of men born to the exercise of arms was\r\n      sought for in the country rather than in cities; and it was very\r\n      reasonably presumed, that the hardy occupations of smiths,\r\n      carpenters, and huntsmen, would supply more vigor and resolution\r\n      than the sedentary trades which are employed in the service of\r\n      luxury. 32 After every qualification of property had been laid\r\n      aside, the armies of the Roman emperors were still commanded, for\r\n      the most part, by officers of liberal birth and education; but\r\n      the common soldiers, like the mercenary troops of modern Europe,\r\n      were drawn from the meanest, and very frequently from the most\r\n      profligate, of mankind.\r\n\r\n      30 (return) [ The poorest rank of soldiers possessed above forty\r\n      pounds sterling, (Dionys.

Such a sentiment, which had rendered the legions\r\n      of the republic almost invincible, could make but a very feeble\r\n      impression on the mercenary servants of a despotic prince; and it\r\n      became necessary to supply that defect by other motives, of a\r\n      different, but not less forcible nature—honor and religion. The\r\n      peasant, or mechanic, imbibed the useful prejudice that he was\r\n      advanced to the more dignified profession of arms, in which his\r\n      rank and reputation would depend on his own valor; and that,\r\n      although the prowess of a private soldier must often escape the\r\n      notice of fame, his own behavior might sometimes confer glory or\r\n      disgrace on the company, the legion, or even the army, to whose\r\n      honors he was associated. On his first entrance into the service,\r\n      an oath was administered to him with every circumstance of\r\n      solemnity. He promised never to desert his standard, to submit\r\n      his own will to the commands of his leaders, and to sacrifice his\r\n      life for the safety of the emperor and the empire. 33 The\r\n      attachment of the Roman troops to their standards was inspired by\r\n      the united influence of religion and of honor. The golden eagle,\r\n      which glittered in the front of the legion, was the object of\r\n      their fondest devotion; nor was it esteemed less impious than it\r\n      was ignominious, to abandon that sacred ensign in the hour of\r\n      danger. 34 These motives, which derived their strength from the\r\n      imagination, were enforced by fears and hopes of a more\r\n      substantial kind. Regular pay, occasional donatives, and a stated\r\n      recompense, after the appointed time of service, alleviated the\r\n      hardships of the military life, 35 whilst, on the other hand, it\r\n      was impossible for cowardice or disobedience to escape the\r\n      severest punishment. The centurions were authorized to chastise\r\n      with blows, the generals had a right to punish with death; and it\r\n      was an inflexible maxim of Roman discipline, that a good soldier\r\n      should dread his officers far more than the enemy. From such\r\n      laudable arts did the valor of the Imperial troops receive a\r\n      degree of firmness and docility unattainable by the impetuous and\r\n      irregular passions of barbarians.\r\n\r\n      33 (return) [ The oath of service and fidelity to the emperor was\r\n      annually renewed by the troops on the first of January.]\r\n\r\n      34 (return) [ Tacitus calls the Roman eagles, Bellorum Deos.

The recruits and young soldiers were constantly\r\n      trained, both in the morning and in the evening, nor was age or\r\n      knowledge allowed to excuse the veterans from the daily\r\n      repetition of what they had completely learnt. Large sheds were\r\n      erected in the winter-quarters of the troops, that their useful\r\n      labors might not receive any interruption from the most\r\n      tempestuous weather; and it was carefully observed, that the arms\r\n      destined to this imitation of war, should be of double the weight\r\n      which was required in real action. 37 It is not the purpose of\r\n      this work to enter into any minute description of the Roman\r\n      exercises. We shall only remark, that they comprehended whatever\r\n      could add strength to the body, activity to the limbs, or grace\r\n      to the motions. The soldiers were diligently instructed to march,\r\n      to run, to leap, to swim, to carry heavy burdens, to handle every\r\n      species of arms that was used either for offence or for defence,\r\n      either in distant engagement or in a closer onset; to form a\r\n      variety of evolutions; and to move to the sound of flutes in the\r\n      Pyrrhic or martial dance. 38 In the midst of peace, the Roman\r\n      troops familiarized themselves with the practice of war; and it\r\n      is prettily remarked by an ancient historian who had fought\r\n      against them, that the effusion of blood was the only\r\n      circumstance which distinguished a field of battle from a field\r\n      of exercise. 39 It was the policy of the ablest generals, and\r\n      even of the emperors themselves, to encourage these military\r\n      studies by their presence and example; and we are informed that\r\n      Hadrian, as well as Trajan, frequently condescended to instruct\r\n      the unexperienced soldiers, to reward the diligent, and sometimes\r\n      to dispute with them the prize of superior strength or dexterity.\r\n      40 Under the reigns of those princes, the science of tactics was\r\n      cultivated with success; and as long as the empire retained any\r\n      vigor, their military instructions were respected as the most\r\n      perfect model of Roman discipline.\r\n\r\n      36 (return) [ _Exercitus ab exercitando_, Varro de Lingua Latina,\r\n      l. iv.

Life of Hadrian, in the\r\n      Augustan History.]\r\n\r\n      Nine centuries of war had gradually introduced into the service\r\n      many alterations and improvements. The legions, as they are\r\n      described by Polybius, 41 in the time of the Punic wars, differed\r\n      very materially from those which achieved the victories of Cæsar,\r\n      or defended the monarchy of Hadrian and the Antonines. The\r\n      constitution of the Imperial legion may be described in a few\r\n      words. 42 The heavy-armed infantry, which composed its principal\r\n      strength, 43 was divided into ten cohorts, and fifty-five\r\n      companies, under the orders of a correspondent number of tribunes\r\n      and centurions. The first cohort, which always claimed the post\r\n      of honor and the custody of the eagle, was formed of eleven\r\n      hundred and five soldiers, the most approved for valor and\r\n      fidelity. The remaining nine cohorts consisted each of five\r\n      hundred and fifty-five; and the whole body of legionary infantry\r\n      amounted to six thousand one hundred men. Their arms were\r\n      uniform, and admirably adapted to the nature of their service: an\r\n      open helmet, with a lofty crest; a breastplate, or coat of mail;\r\n      greaves on their legs, and an ample buckler on their left arm.\r\n      The buckler was of an oblong and concave figure, four feet in\r\n      length, and two and a half in breadth, framed of a light wood,\r\n      covered with a bull’s hide, and strongly guarded with plates of\r\n      brass. Besides a lighter spear, the legionary soldier grasped in\r\n      his right hand the formidable _pilum_, a ponderous javelin, whose\r\n      utmost length was about six feet, and which was terminated by a\r\n      massy triangular point of steel of eighteen inches. 44 This\r\n      instrument was indeed much inferior to our modern fire-arms;\r\n      since it was exhausted by a single discharge, at the distance of\r\n      only ten or twelve paces. Yet when it was launched by a firm and\r\n      skilful hand, there was not any cavalry that durst venture within\r\n      its reach, nor any shield or corselet that could sustain the\r\n      impetuosity of its weight. As soon as the Roman had darted his\r\n      _pilum_, he drew his sword, and rushed forwards to close with the\r\n      enemy. His sword was a short well-tempered Spanish blade, that\r\n      carried a double edge, and was alike suited to the purpose of\r\n      striking or of pushing; but the soldier was always instructed to\r\n      prefer the latter use of his weapon, as his own body remained\r\n      less exposed, whilst he inflicted a more dangerous wound on his\r\n      adversary. 45 The legion was usually drawn up eight deep; and the\r\n      regular distance of three feet was left between the files as well\r\n      as ranks. 46 A body of troops, habituated to preserve this open\r\n      order, in a long front and a rapid charge, found themselves\r\n      prepared to execute every disposition which the circumstances of\r\n      war, or the skill of their leader, might suggest. The soldier\r\n      possessed a free space for his arms and motions, and sufficient\r\n      intervals were allowed, through which seasonable reinforcements\r\n      might be introduced to the relief of the exhausted combatants. 47\r\n      The tactics of the Greeks and Macedonians were formed on very\r\n      different principles. The strength of the phalanx depended on\r\n      sixteen ranks of long pikes, wedged together in the closest\r\n      array. 48 But it was soon discovered by reflection, as well as by\r\n      the event, that the strength of the phalanx was unable to contend\r\n      with the activity of the legion. 49\r\n\r\n      41 (return) [ See an admirable digression on the Roman\r\n      discipline, in the sixth book of his History.]\r\n\r\n      42 (return) [ Vegetius de Re Militari, l. ii. c. 4, &c.\r\n      Considerable part of his very perplexed abridgment was taken from\r\n      the regulations of Trajan and Hadrian; and the legion, as he\r\n      describes it, cannot suit any other age of the Roman empire.]\r\n\r\n      43 (return) [Vegetius de Re Militari, l. ii. c. 1.

(xviii. 9.)]\r\n\r\n      The cavalry, without which the force of the legion would have\r\n      remained imperfect, was divided into ten troops or squadrons; the\r\n      first, as the companion of the first cohort, consisted of a\r\n      hundred and thirty-two men; whilst each of the other nine\r\n      amounted only to sixty-six. The entire establishment formed a\r\n      regiment, if we may use the modern expression, of seven hundred\r\n      and twenty-six horse, naturally connected with its respective\r\n      legion, but occasionally separated to act in the line, and to\r\n      compose a part of the wings of the army. 50 The cavalry of the\r\n      emperors was no longer composed, like that of the ancient\r\n      republic, of the noblest youths of Rome and Italy, who, by\r\n      performing their military service on horseback, prepared\r\n      themselves for the offices of senator and consul; and solicited,\r\n      by deeds of valor, the future suffrages of their countrymen. 51\r\n      Since the alteration of manners and government, the most wealthy\r\n      of the equestrian order were engaged in the administration of\r\n      justice, and of the revenue; 52 and whenever they embraced the\r\n      profession of arms, they were immediately intrusted with a troop\r\n      of horse, or a cohort of foot. 53 Trajan and Hadrian formed their\r\n      cavalry from the same provinces, and the same class of their\r\n      subjects, which recruited the ranks of the legion. The horses\r\n      were bred, for the most part, in Spain or Cappadocia.

A\r\n      javelin, and a long broad sword, were their principal weapons of\r\n      offence.

This\r\n      appears to have been a defect in the Roman discipline; which\r\n      Hadrian endeavored to remedy by ascertaining the legal age of a\r\n      tribune. * Note: These details are not altogether accurate.\r\n      Although, in the latter days of the republic, and under the first\r\n      emperors, the young Roman nobles obtained the command of a\r\n      squadron or a cohort with greater facility than in the former\r\n      times, they never obtained it without passing through a tolerably\r\n      long military service. Usually they served first in the prætorian\r\n      cohort, which was intrusted with the guard of the general: they\r\n      were received into the companionship (contubernium) of some\r\n      superior officer, and were there formed for duty. Thus Julius\r\n      Cæsar, though sprung from a great family, served first as\r\n      contubernalis under the prætor, M. Thermus, and later under\r\n      Servilius the Isaurian. (Suet. Jul. 2, 5. Plut. in Par. p. 516.\r\n      Ed. Froben.) The example of Horace, which Gibbon adduces to prove\r\n      that young knights were made tribunes immediately on entering the\r\n      service, proves nothing. In the first place, Horace was not a\r\n      knight; he was the son of a freedman of Venusia, in Apulia, who\r\n      exercised the humble office of coactor exauctionum, (collector of\r\n      payments at auctions.) (Sat. i. vi. 45, or 86.) Moreover, when\r\n      the poet was made tribune, Brutus, whose army was nearly entirely\r\n      composed of Orientals, gave this title to all the Romans of\r\n      consideration who joined him. The emperors were still less\r\n      difficult in their choice; the number of tribunes was augmented;\r\n      the title and honors were conferred on persons whom they wished\r\n      to attack to the court. Augustus conferred on the sons of\r\n      senators, sometimes the tribunate, sometimes the command of a\r\n      squadron. Claudius gave to the knights who entered into the\r\n      service, first the command of a cohort of auxiliaries, later that\r\n      of a squadron, and at length, for the first time, the tribunate.\r\n      (Suet in Claud. with the notes of Ernesti.) The abuses that arose\r\n      caused by the edict of Hadrian, which fixed the age at which that\r\n      honor could be attained. (Spart. in Had. &c.) This edict was\r\n      subsequently obeyed; for the emperor Valerian, in a letter\r\n      addressed to Mulvius Gallinnus, prætorian præfect, excuses\r\n      himself for having violated it in favor of the young Probus\r\n      afterwards emperor, on whom he had conferred the tribunate at an\r\n      earlier age on account of his rare talents. (Vopisc. in Prob.\r\n      iv.)—W. and G. Agricola, though already invested with the title\r\n      of tribune, was contubernalis in Britain with Suetonius Paulinus.\r\n      Tac. Agr. v.—M.]\r\n\r\n      54 (return) [ See Arrian’s Tactics.]\r\n\r\n      The safety and honor of the empire was principally intrusted to\r\n      the legions, but the policy of Rome condescended to adopt every\r\n      useful instrument of war. Considerable levies were regularly made\r\n      among the provincials, who had not yet deserved the honorable\r\n      distinction of Romans. Many dependent princes and communities,\r\n      dispersed round the frontiers, were permitted, for a while, to\r\n      hold their freedom and security by the tenure of military\r\n      service. 55 Even select troops of hostile barbarians were\r\n      frequently compelled or persuaded to consume their dangerous\r\n      valor in remote climates, and for the benefit of the state. 56\r\n      All these were included under the general name of auxiliaries;\r\n      and howsoever they might vary according to the difference of\r\n      times and circumstances, their numbers were seldom much inferior\r\n      to those of the legions themselves. 57 Among the auxiliaries, the\r\n      bravest and most faithful bands were placed under the command of\r\n      præfects and centurions, and severely trained in the arts of\r\n      Roman discipline; but the far greater part retained those arms,\r\n      to which the nature of their country, or their early habits of\r\n      life, more peculiarly adapted them. By this institution, each\r\n      legion, to whom a certain proportion of auxiliaries was allotted,\r\n      contained within itself every species of lighter troops, and of\r\n      missile weapons; and was capable of encountering every nation,\r\n      with the advantages of its respective arms and discipline. 58 Nor\r\n      was the legion destitute of what, in modern language, would be\r\n      styled a train of artillery. It consisted in ten military engines\r\n      of the largest, and fifty-five of a smaller size; but all of\r\n      which, either in an oblique or horizontal manner, discharged\r\n      stones and darts with irresistible violence. 59\r\n\r\n      55 (return) [ Such, in particular, was the state of the\r\n      Batavians.

Its form\r\n      was an exact quadrangle; and we may calculate, that a square of\r\n      about seven hundred yards was sufficient for the encampment of\r\n      twenty thousand Romans; though a similar number of our own troops\r\n      would expose to the enemy a front of more than treble that\r\n      extent. In the midst of the camp, the prætorium, or general’s\r\n      quarters, rose above the others; the cavalry, the infantry, and\r\n      the auxiliaries occupied their respective stations; the streets\r\n      were broad and perfectly straight, and a vacant space of two\r\n      hundred feet was left on all sides between the tents and the\r\n      rampart. The rampart itself was usually twelve feet high, armed\r\n      with a line of strong and intricate palisades, and defended by a\r\n      ditch of twelve feet in depth as well as in breadth. This\r\n      important labor was performed by the hands of the legionaries\r\n      themselves; to whom the use of the spade and the pickaxe was no\r\n      less familiar than that of the sword or _pilum_.

We may compute, however,\r\n      that the legion, which was itself a body of six thousand eight\r\n      hundred and thirty-one Romans, might, with its attendant\r\n      auxiliaries, amount to about twelve thousand five hundred men.\r\n      The peace establishment of Hadrian and his successors was\r\n      composed of no less than thirty of these formidable brigades; and\r\n      most probably formed a standing force of three hundred and\r\n      seventy-five thousand men. Instead of being confined within the\r\n      walls of fortified cities, which the Romans considered as the\r\n      refuge of weakness or pusillanimity, the legions were encamped on\r\n      the banks of the great rivers, and along the frontiers of the\r\n      barbarians. As their stations, for the most part, remained fixed\r\n      and permanent, we may venture to describe the distribution of the\r\n      troops. Three legions were sufficient for Britain. The principal\r\n      strength lay upon the Rhine and Danube, and consisted of sixteen\r\n      legions, in the following proportions: two in the Lower, and\r\n      three in the Upper Germany; one in Rhætia, one in Noricum, four\r\n      in Pannonia, three in Mæsia, and two in Dacia. The defence of the\r\n      Euphrates was intrusted to eight legions, six of whom were\r\n      planted in Syria, and the other two in Cappadocia. With regard to\r\n      Egypt, Africa, and Spain, as they were far removed from any\r\n      important scene of war, a single legion maintained the domestic\r\n      tranquillity of each of those great provinces. Even Italy was not\r\n      left destitute of a military force. Above twenty thousand chosen\r\n      soldiers, distinguished by the titles of City Cohorts and\r\n      Prætorian Guards, watched over the safety of the monarch and the\r\n      capital. As the authors of almost every revolution that\r\n      distracted the empire, the Prætorians will, very soon, and very\r\n      loudly, demand our attention; but, in their arms and\r\n      institutions, we cannot find any circumstance which discriminated\r\n      them from the legions, unless it were a more splendid appearance,\r\n      and a less rigid discipline. 65\r\n\r\n      65 (return) [ Tacitus (Annal. iv. 5) has given us a state of the\r\n      legions under Tiberius; and Dion Cassius (l. lv. p. 794) under\r\n      Alexander Severus.

See likewise Lipsius de Magnitudine\r\n      Romana, l. i. c. 4, 5.]\r\n\r\n      The navy maintained by the emperors might seem inadequate to\r\n      their greatness; but it was fully sufficient for every useful\r\n      purpose of government. The ambition of the Romans was confined to\r\n      the land; nor was that warlike people ever actuated by the\r\n      enterprising spirit which had prompted the navigators of Tyre, of\r\n      Carthage, and even of Marseilles, to enlarge the bounds of the\r\n      world, and to explore the most remote coasts of the ocean. To the\r\n      Romans the ocean remained an object of terror rather than of\r\n      curiosity; 66 the whole extent of the Mediterranean, after the\r\n      destruction of Carthage, and the extirpation of the pirates, was\r\n      included within their provinces. The policy of the emperors was\r\n      directed only to preserve the peaceful dominion of that sea, and\r\n      to protect the commerce of their subjects. With these moderate\r\n      views, Augustus stationed two permanent fleets in the most\r\n      convenient ports of Italy, the one at Ravenna, on the Adriatic,\r\n      the other at Misenum, in the Bay of Naples. Experience seems at\r\n      length to have convinced the ancients, that as soon as their\r\n      galleys exceeded two, or at the most three ranks of oars, they\r\n      were suited rather for vain pomp than for real service. Augustus\r\n      himself, in the victory of Actium, had seen the superiority of\r\n      his own light frigates (they were called Liburnians) over the\r\n      lofty but unwieldy castles of his rival. 67 Of these Liburnians\r\n      he composed the two fleets of Ravenna and Misenum, destined to\r\n      command, the one the eastern, the other the western division of\r\n      the Mediterranean; and to each of the squadrons he attached a\r\n      body of several thousand marines. Besides these two ports, which\r\n      may be considered as the principal seats of the Roman navy, a\r\n      very considerable force was stationed at Frejus, on the coast of\r\n      Provence, and the Euxine was guarded by forty ships, and three\r\n      thousand soldiers. To all these we add the fleet which preserved\r\n      the communication between Gaul and Britain, and a great number of\r\n      vessels constantly maintained on the Rhine and Danube, to harass\r\n      the country, or to intercept the passage of the barbarians. 68 If\r\n      we review this general state of the Imperial forces; of the\r\n      cavalry as well as infantry; of the legions, the auxiliaries, the\r\n      guards, and the navy; the most liberal computation will not allow\r\n      us to fix the entire establishment by sea and by land at more\r\n      than four hundred and fifty thousand men: a military power,\r\n      which, however formidable it may seem, was equalled by a monarch\r\n      of the last century, whose kingdom was confined within a single\r\n      province of the Roman empire. 69\r\n\r\n      66 (return) [ The Romans tried to disguise, by the pretence of\r\n      religious awe their ignorance and terror.

Spain, the\r\n      western extremity of the empire, of Europe, and of the ancient\r\n      world, has, in every age, invariably preserved the same natural\r\n      limits; the Pyrenæan Mountains, the Mediterranean, and the\r\n      Atlantic Ocean. That great peninsula, at present so unequally\r\n      divided between two sovereigns, was distributed by Augustus into\r\n      three provinces, Lusitania, Bætica, and Tarraconensis. The\r\n      kingdom of Portugal now fills the place of the warlike country of\r\n      the Lusitanians; and the loss sustained by the former on the side\r\n      of the East, is compensated by an accession of territory towards\r\n      the North. The confines of Grenada and Andalusia correspond with\r\n      those of ancient Bætica. The remainder of Spain, Gallicia, and\r\n      the Asturias, Biscay, and Navarre, Leon, and the two Castiles,\r\n      Murcia, Valencia, Catalonia, and Arragon, all contributed to form\r\n      the third and most considerable of the Roman governments, which,\r\n      from the name of its capital, was styled the province of\r\n      Tarragona. 70 Of the native barbarians, the Celtiberians were the\r\n      most powerful, as the Cantabrians and Asturians proved the most\r\n      obstinate. Confident in the strength of their mountains, they\r\n      were the last who submitted to the arms of Rome, and the first\r\n      who threw off the yoke of the Arabs.\r\n\r\n      70 (return) [ See Strabo, l. ii. It is natural enough to suppose,\r\n      that Arragon is derived from Tarraconensis, and several moderns\r\n      who have written in Latin use those words as synonymous. It is,\r\n      however, certain, that the Arragon, a little stream which falls\r\n      from the Pyrenees into the Ebro, first gave its name to a\r\n      country, and gradually to a kingdom. See d’Anville, Geographie du\r\n      Moyen Age, p. 181.]\r\n\r\n      Ancient Gaul, as it contained the whole country between the\r\n      Pyrenees, the Alps, the Rhine, and the Ocean, was of greater\r\n      extent than modern France. To the dominions of that powerful\r\n      monarchy, with its recent acquisitions of Alsace and Lorraine, we\r\n      must add the duchy of Savoy, the cantons of Switzerland, the four\r\n      electorates of the Rhine, and the territories of Liege,\r\n      Luxemburgh, Hainault, Flanders, and Brabant. When Augustus gave\r\n      laws to the conquests of his father, he introduced a division of\r\n      Gaul, equally adapted to the progress of the legions, to the\r\n      course of the rivers, and to the principal national distinctions,\r\n      which had comprehended above a hundred independent states. 71 The\r\n      sea-coast of the Mediterranean, Languedoc, Provence, and\r\n      Dauphiné, received their provincial appellation from the colony\r\n      of Narbonne. The government of Aquitaine was extended from the\r\n      Pyrenees to the Loire. The country between the Loire and the\r\n      Seine was styled the Celtic Gaul, and soon borrowed a new\r\n      denomination from the celebrated colony of Lugdunum, or Lyons.\r\n      The Belgic lay beyond the Seine, and in more ancient times had\r\n      been bounded only by the Rhine; but a little before the age of\r\n      Cæsar, the Germans, abusing their superiority of valor, had\r\n      occupied a considerable portion of the Belgic territory. The\r\n      Roman conquerors very eagerly embraced so flattering a\r\n      circumstance, and the Gallic frontier of the Rhine, from Basil to\r\n      Leyden, received the pompous names of the Upper and the Lower\r\n      Germany. 72 Such, under the reign of the Antonines, were the six\r\n      provinces of Gaul; the Narbonnese, Aquitaine, the Celtic, or\r\n      Lyonnese, the Belgic, and the two Germanies.\r\n\r\n      71 (return) [ One hundred and fifteen _cities_ appear in the\r\n      Notitia of Gaul; and it is well known that this appellation was\r\n      applied not only to the capital town, but to the whole territory\r\n      of each state.

Notice de l’Ancienne Gaule.]\r\n\r\n      We have already had occasion to mention the conquest of Britain,\r\n      and to fix the boundary of the Roman Province in this island. It\r\n      comprehended all England, Wales, and the Lowlands of Scotland, as\r\n      far as the Friths of Dumbarton and Edinburgh. Before Britain lost\r\n      her freedom, the country was irregularly divided between thirty\r\n      tribes of barbarians, of whom the most considerable were the\r\n      Belgæ in the West, the Brigantes in the North, the Silures in\r\n      South Wales, and the Iceni in Norfolk and Suffolk. 73 As far as\r\n      we can either trace or credit the resemblance of manners and\r\n      language, Spain, Gaul, and Britain were peopled by the same hardy\r\n      race of savages. Before they yielded to the Roman arms, they\r\n      often disputed the field, and often renewed the contest. After\r\n      their submission, they constituted the western division of the\r\n      European provinces, which extended from the columns of Hercules\r\n      to the wall of Antoninus, and from the mouth of the Tagus to the\r\n      sources of the Rhine and Danube.\r\n\r\n      73 (return) [ Whittaker’s History of Manchester, vol. i. c. 3.]\r\n      Before the Roman conquest, the country which is now called\r\n      Lombardy, was not considered as a part of Italy. It had been\r\n      occupied by a powerful colony of Gauls, who, settling themselves\r\n      along the banks of the Po, from Piedmont to Romagna, carried\r\n      their arms and diffused their name from the Alps to the Apennine.\r\n\r\n      The Ligurians dwelt on the rocky coast which now forms the\r\n      republic of Genoa. Venice was yet unborn; but the territories of\r\n      that state, which lie to the east of the Adige, were inhabited by\r\n      the Venetians. 74 The middle part of the peninsula, that now\r\n      composes the duchy of Tuscany and the ecclesiastical state, was\r\n      the ancient seat of the Etruscans and Umbrians; to the former of\r\n      whom Italy was indebted for the first rudiments of civilized\r\n      life. 75 The Tyber rolled at the foot of the seven hills of Rome,\r\n      and the country of the Sabines, the Latins, and the Volsci, from\r\n      that river to the frontiers of Naples, was the theatre of her\r\n      infant victories. On that celebrated ground the first consuls\r\n      deserved triumphs, their successors adorned villas, and _their_\r\n      posterity have erected convents. 76 Capua and Campania possessed\r\n      the immediate territory of Naples; the rest of the kingdom was\r\n      inhabited by many warlike nations, the Marsi, the Samnites, the\r\n      Apulians, and the Lucanians; and the sea-coasts had been covered\r\n      by the flourishing colonies of the Greeks. We may remark, that\r\n      when Augustus divided Italy into eleven regions, the little\r\n      province of Istria was annexed to that seat of Roman sovereignty.\r\n      77\r\n\r\n      74 (return) [ The Italian Veneti, though often confounded with\r\n      the Gauls, were more probably of Illyrian origin.

The latter of those mighty streams,\r\n      which rises at the distance of only thirty miles from the former,\r\n      flows above thirteen hundred miles, for the most part to the\r\n      south-east, collects the tribute of sixty navigable rivers, and\r\n      is, at length, through six mouths, received into the Euxine,\r\n      which appears scarcely equal to such an accession of waters. 78\r\n      The provinces of the Danube soon acquired the general appellation\r\n      of Illyricum, or the Illyrian frontier, 79 and were esteemed the\r\n      most warlike of the empire; but they deserve to be more\r\n      particularly considered under the names of Rhætia, Noricum,\r\n      Pannonia, Dalmatia, Dacia, Mæsia, Thrace, Macedonia, and Greece.\r\n\r\n      78 (return) [ Tournefort, Voyages en Grece et Asie Mineure,\r\n      lettre xviii.]\r\n\r\n      79 (return) [ The name of Illyricum originally belonged to the\r\n      sea-coast of the Adriatic, and was gradually extended by the\r\n      Romans from the Alps to the Euxine Sea. See Severini Pannonia, l.\r\n      i. c. 3.]\r\n\r\n      The province of Rhætia, which soon extinguished the name of the\r\n      Vindelicians, extended from the summit of the Alps to the banks\r\n      of the Danube; from its source, as far as its conflux with the\r\n      Inn. The greatest part of the flat country is subject to the\r\n      elector of Bavaria; the city of Augsburg is protected by the\r\n      constitution of the German empire; the Grisons are safe in their\r\n      mountains, and the country of Tirol is ranked among the numerous\r\n      provinces of the house of Austria.\r\n\r\n      The wide extent of territory which is included between the Inn,\r\n      the Danube, and the Save,—Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola,\r\n      the Lower Hungary, and Sclavonia,—was known to the ancients under\r\n      the names of Noricum and Pannonia. In their original state of\r\n      independence, their fierce inhabitants were intimately connected.\r\n      Under the Roman government they were frequently united, and they\r\n      still remain the patrimony of a single family. They now contain\r\n      the residence of a German prince, who styles himself Emperor of\r\n      the Romans, and form the centre, as well as strength, of the\r\n      Austrian power. It may not be improper to observe, that if we\r\n      except Bohemia, Moravia, the northern skirts of Austria, and a\r\n      part of Hungary between the Teyss and the Danube, all the other\r\n      dominions of the House of Austria were comprised within the\r\n      limits of the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\n      Dalmatia, to which the name of Illyricum more properly belonged,\r\n      was a long, but narrow tract, between the Save and the Adriatic.\r\n      The best part of the sea-coast, which still retains its ancient\r\n      appellation, is a province of the Venetian state, and the seat of\r\n      the little republic of Ragusa. The inland parts have assumed the\r\n      Sclavonian names of Croatia and Bosnia; the former obeys an\r\n      Austrian governor, the latter a Turkish pacha; but the whole\r\n      country is still infested by tribes of barbarians, whose savage\r\n      independence irregularly marks the doubtful limit of the\r\n      Christian and Mahometan power. 80\r\n\r\n      80 (return) [ A Venetian traveller, the Abbate Fortis, has lately\r\n      given us some account of those very obscure countries.

If we inquire into the present state\r\n      of those countries, we shall find that, on the left hand of the\r\n      Danube, Temeswar and Transylvania have been annexed, after many\r\n      revolutions, to the crown of Hungary; whilst the principalities\r\n      of Moldavia and Wallachia acknowledge the supremacy of the\r\n      Ottoman Porte. On the right hand of the Danube, Mæsia, which,\r\n      during the middle ages, was broken into the barbarian kingdoms of\r\n      Servia and Bulgaria, is again united in Turkish slavery.\r\n\r\n      81 (return) [ The Save rises near the confines of _Istria_, and\r\n      was considered by the more early Greeks as the principal stream\r\n      of the Danube.]\r\n\r\n      The appellation of Roumelia, which is still bestowed by the Turks\r\n      on the extensive countries of Thrace, Macedonia, and Greece,\r\n      preserves the memory of their ancient state under the Roman\r\n      empire. In the time of the Antonines, the martial regions of\r\n      Thrace, from the mountains of Hæmus and Rhodope, to the Bosphorus\r\n      and the Hellespont, had assumed the form of a province.\r\n      Notwithstanding the change of masters and of religion, the new\r\n      city of Rome, founded by Constantine on the banks of the\r\n      Bosphorus, has ever since remained the capital of a great\r\n      monarchy. The kingdom of Macedonia, which, under the reign of\r\n      Alexander, gave laws to Asia, derived more solid advantages from\r\n      the policy of the two Philips; and with its dependencies of\r\n      Epirus and Thessaly, extended from the Ægean to the Ionian Sea.\r\n      When we reflect on the fame of Thebes and Argos, of Sparta and\r\n      Athens, we can scarcely persuade ourselves, that so many immortal\r\n      republics of ancient Greece were lost in a single province of the\r\n      Roman empire, which, from the superior influence of the Achæan\r\n      league, was usually denominated the province of Achaia.\r\n\r\n      Such was the state of Europe under the Roman emperors. The\r\n      provinces of Asia, without excepting the transient conquests of\r\n      Trajan, are all comprehended within the limits of the Turkish\r\n      power. But, instead of following the arbitrary divisions of\r\n      despotism and ignorance, it will be safer for us, as well as more\r\n      agreeable, to observe the indelible characters of nature. The\r\n      name of Asia Minor is attributed with some propriety to the\r\n      peninsula, which, confined betwixt the Euxine and the\r\n      Mediterranean, advances from the Euphrates towards Europe. The\r\n      most extensive and flourishing district, westward of Mount Taurus\r\n      and the River Halys, was dignified by the Romans with the\r\n      exclusive title of Asia. The jurisdiction of that province\r\n      extended over the ancient monarchies of Troy, Lydia, and Phrygia,\r\n      the maritime countries of the Pamphylians, Lycians, and Carians,\r\n      and the Grecian colonies of Ionia, which equalled in arts, though\r\n      not in arms, the glory of their parent. The kingdoms of Bithynia\r\n      and Pontus possessed the northern side of the peninsula from\r\n      Constantinople to Trebizond. On the opposite side, the province\r\n      of Cilicia was terminated by the mountains of Syria: the inland\r\n      country, separated from the Roman Asia by the River Halys, and\r\n      from Armenia by the Euphrates, had once formed the independent\r\n      kingdom of Cappadocia. In this place we may observe, that the\r\n      northern shores of the Euxine, beyond Trebizond in Asia, and\r\n      beyond the Danube in Europe, acknowledged the sovereignty of the\r\n      emperors, and received at their hands either tributary princes or\r\n      Roman garrisons. Budzak, Crim Tartary, Circassia, and Mingrelia,\r\n      are the modern appellations of those savage countries. 82\r\n\r\n      82 (return) [ See the Periplus of Arrian. He examined the coasts\r\n      of the Euxine, when he was governor of Cappadocia.]\r\n\r\n      Under the successors of Alexander, Syria was the seat of the\r\n      Seleucidæ, who reigned over Upper Asia, till the successful\r\n      revolt of the Parthians confined their dominions between the\r\n      Euphrates and the Mediterranean. When Syria became subject to the\r\n      Romans, it formed the eastern frontier of their empire: nor did\r\n      that province, in its utmost latitude, know any other bounds than\r\n      the mountains of Cappadocia to the north, and towards the south,\r\n      the confines of Egypt, and the Red Sea. Phœnicia and Palestine\r\n      were sometimes annexed to, and sometimes separated from, the\r\n      jurisdiction of Syria. The former of these was a narrow and rocky\r\n      coast; the latter was a territory scarcely superior to Wales,\r\n      either in fertility or extent. 821 Yet Phœnicia and Palestine\r\n      will forever live in the memory of mankind; since America, as\r\n      well as Europe, has received letters from the one, and religion\r\n      from the other. 83 A sandy desert, alike destitute of wood and\r\n      water, skirts along the doubtful confine of Syria, from the\r\n      Euphrates to the Red Sea. The wandering life of the Arabs was\r\n      inseparably connected with their independence; and wherever, on\r\n      some spots less barren than the rest, they ventured to for many\r\n      settled habitations, they soon became subjects to the Roman\r\n      empire. 84\r\n\r\n      821 (return) [ This comparison is exaggerated, with the\r\n      intention, no doubt, of attacking the authority of the Bible,\r\n      which boasts of the fertility of Palestine. Gibbon’s only\r\n      authorities were that of Strabo (l. xvi. 1104) and the present\r\n      state of the country. But Strabo only speaks of the neighborhood\r\n      of Jerusalem, which he calls barren and arid to the extent of\r\n      sixty stadia round the city: in other parts he gives a favorable\r\n      testimony to the fertility of many parts of Palestine: thus he\r\n      says, “Near Jericho there is a grove of palms, and a country of a\r\n      hundred stadia, full of springs, and well peopled.” Moreover,\r\n      Strabo had never seen Palestine; he spoke only after reports,\r\n      which may be as inaccurate as those according to which he has\r\n      composed that description of Germany, in which Gluverius has\r\n      detected so many errors. (Gluv. Germ. iii. 1.) Finally, his\r\n      testimony is contradicted and refuted by that of other ancient\r\n      authors, and by medals. Tacitus says, in speaking of Palestine,\r\n      “The inhabitants are healthy and robust; the rains moderate; the\r\n      soil fertile.” (Hist. v. 6.) Ammianus Macellinus says also, “The\r\n      last of the Syrias is Palestine, a country of considerable\r\n      extent, abounding in clean and well-cultivated land, and\r\n      containing some fine cities, none of which yields to the other;\r\n      but, as it were, being on a parallel, are rivals.”—xiv. 8. See\r\n      also the historian Josephus, Hist. vi. 1. Procopius of Cæserea,\r\n      who lived in the sixth century, says that Chosroes, king of\r\n      Persia, had a great desire to make himself master of Palestine,\r\n      _on account of its_ extraordinary fertility, its opulence, and\r\n      the great number of its inhabitants. The Saracens thought the\r\n      same, and were afraid that Omar. when he went to Jerusalem,\r\n      charmed with the fertility of the soil and the purity of the air,\r\n      would never return to Medina. (Ockley, Hist. of Sarac. i. 232.)\r\n      The importance attached by the Romans to the conquest of\r\n      Palestine, and the obstacles they encountered, prove also the\r\n      richness and population of the country. Vespasian and Titus\r\n      caused medals to be struck with trophies, in which Palestine is\r\n      represented by a female under a palm-tree, to signify the\r\n      richness of he country, with this legend: _Judæa capta_. Other\r\n      medals also indicate this fertility; for instance, that of Herod\r\n      holding a bunch of grapes, and that of the young Agrippa\r\n      displaying fruit. As to the present state of he country, one\r\n      perceives that it is not fair to draw any inference against its\r\n      ancient fertility: the disasters through which it has passed, the\r\n      government to which it is subject, the disposition of the\r\n      inhabitants, explain sufficiently the wild and uncultivated\r\n      appearance of the land, where, nevertheless, fertile and\r\n      cultivated districts are still found, according to the testimony\r\n      of travellers; among others, of Shaw, Maundrel, La Rocque, &c.—G.\r\n      The Abbé Guénée, in his _Lettres de quelques Juifs à Mons. de\r\n      Voltaire_, has exhausted the subject of the fertility of\r\n      Palestine; for Voltaire had likewise indulged in sarcasm on this\r\n      subject. Gibbon was assailed on this point, not, indeed, by Mr.\r\n      Davis, who, he slyly insinuates, was prevented by his patriotism\r\n      as a Welshman from resenting the comparison with Wales, but by\r\n      other writers. In his Vindication, he first established the\r\n      correctness of his measurement of Palestine, which he estimates\r\n      as 7600 square English miles, while Wales is about 7011. As to\r\n      fertility, he proceeds in the following dexterously composed and\r\n      splendid passage: “The emperor Frederick II., the enemy and the\r\n      victim of the clergy, is accused of saying, after his return from\r\n      his crusade, that the God of the Jews would have despised his\r\n      promised land, if he had once seen the fruitful realms of Sicily\r\n      and Naples.” (See Giannone, Istor. Civ. del R. di Napoli, ii.\r\n      245.) This raillery, which malice has, perhaps, falsely imputed\r\n      to Frederick, is inconsistent with truth and piety; yet it must\r\n      be confessed that the soil of Palestine does not contain that\r\n      inexhaustible, and, as it were, spontaneous principle of\r\n      fertility, which, under the most unfavorable circumstances, has\r\n      covered with rich harvests the banks of the Nile, the fields of\r\n      Sicily, or the plains of Poland. The Jordan is the only navigable\r\n      river of Palestine: a considerable part of the narrow space is\r\n      occupied, or rather lost, in the _Dead Sea_ whose horrid aspect\r\n      inspires every sensation of disgust, and countenances every tale\r\n      of horror. The districts which border on Arabia partake of the\r\n      sandy quality of the adjacent desert. The face of the country,\r\n      except the sea-coast, and the valley of the Jordan, is covered\r\n      with mountains, which appear, for the most part, as naked and\r\n      barren rocks; and in the neighborhood of Jerusalem, there is a\r\n      real scarcity of the two elements of earth and water. (See\r\n      Maundrel’s Travels, p. 65, and Reland’s Palestin. i. 238, 395.)\r\n      These disadvantages, which now operate in their fullest extent,\r\n      were formerly corrected by the labors of a numerous people, and\r\n      the active protection of a wise government. The hills were\r\n      clothed with rich beds of artificial mould, the rain was\r\n      collected in vast cisterns, a supply of fresh water was conveyed\r\n      by pipes and aqueducts to the dry lands. The breed of cattle was\r\n      encouraged in those parts which were not adapted for tillage, and\r\n      almost every spot was compelled to yield some production for the\r\n      use of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n      Pater ispe colendi Haud facilem esse viam voluit, primusque par\r\n      artem Movit agros; curis acuens mortalia corda, Nec torpere gravi\r\n      passus sua Regna veterno. Gibbon, Misc. Works, iv. 540.\r\n\r\n      But Gibbon has here eluded the question about the land “flowing\r\n      with milk and honey.” He is describing Judæa only, without\r\n      comprehending Galilee, or the rich pastures beyond the Jordan,\r\n      even now proverbial for their flocks and herds. (See Burckhardt’s\r\n      Travels, and Hist of Jews, i. 178.) The following is believed to\r\n      be a fair statement: “The extraordinary fertility of the whole\r\n      country must be taken into the account. No part was waste; very\r\n      little was occupied by unprofitable wood; the more fertile hills\r\n      were cultivated in artificial terraces, others were hung with\r\n      orchards of fruit trees the more rocky and barren districts were\r\n      covered with vineyards.” Even in the present day, the wars and\r\n      misgovernment of ages have not exhausted the natural richness of\r\n      the soil. “Galilee,” says Malte Brun, “would be a paradise were\r\n      it inhabited by an industrious people under an enlightened\r\n      government. No land could be less dependent on foreign\r\n      importation; it bore within itself every thing that could be\r\n      necessary for the subsistence and comfort of a simple\r\n      agricultural people. The climate was healthy, the seasons\r\n      regular; the former rains, which fell about October, after the\r\n      vintage, prepared the ground for the seed; that latter, which\r\n      prevailed during March and the beginning of April, made it grow\r\n      rapidly. Directly the rains ceased, the grain ripened with still\r\n      greater rapidity, and was gathered in before the end of May. The\r\n      summer months were dry and very hot, but the nights cool and\r\n      refreshed by copious dews. In September, the vintage was\r\n      gathered. Grain of all kinds, wheat, barley, millet, zea, and\r\n      other sorts, grew in abundance; the wheat commonly yielded thirty\r\n      for one. Besides the vine and the olive, the almond, the date,\r\n      figs of many kinds, the orange, the pomegranate, and many other\r\n      fruit trees, flourished in the greatest luxuriance. Great\r\n      quantity of honey was collected. The balm-tree, which produced\r\n      the opobalsamum, a great object of trade, was probably introduced\r\n      from Arabia, in the time of Solomon. It flourished about Jericho\r\n      and in Gilead.”—Milman’s Hist. of Jews. i. 177.—M.]\r\n\r\n      83 (return) [ The progress of religion is well known.

But in a\r\n      period of three thousand years, the Phœnician alphabet received\r\n      considerable alterations, as it passed through the hands of the\r\n      Greeks and Romans.]\r\n\r\n      84 (return) [ Dion Cassius, lib. lxviii. p. 1131.]\r\n\r\n      The geographers of antiquity have frequently hesitated to what\r\n      portion of the globe they should ascribe Egypt. 85 By its\r\n      situation that celebrated kingdom is included within the immense\r\n      peninsula of Africa; but it is accessible only on the side of\r\n      Asia, whose revolutions, in almost every period of history, Egypt\r\n      has humbly obeyed. A Roman præfect was seated on the splendid\r\n      throne of the Ptolemies; and the iron sceptre of the Mamelukes is\r\n      now in the hands of a Turkish pacha.

The genuine Mauritania, or country of the Moors,\r\n      which, from the ancient city of Tingi, or Tangier, was\r\n      distinguished by the appellation of Tingitana, is represented by\r\n      the modern kingdom of Fez. Salle, on the Ocean, so infamous at\r\n      present for its piratical depredations, was noticed by the\r\n      Romans, as the extreme object of their power, and almost of their\r\n      geography.

The obedient provinces of Trajan\r\n      and the Antonines were united by laws, and adorned by arts. They\r\n      might occasionally suffer from the partial abuse of delegated\r\n      authority; but the general principle of government was wise,\r\n      simple, and beneficent.

The policy of the emperors and the senate, as far as it\r\n      concerned religion, was happily seconded by the reflections of\r\n      the enlightened, and by the habits of the superstitious, part of\r\n      their subjects. The various modes of worship, which prevailed in\r\n      the Roman world, were all considered by the people, as equally\r\n      true; by the philosopher, as equally false; and by the\r\n      magistrate, as equally useful. And thus toleration produced not\r\n      only mutual indulgence, but even religious concord.\r\n\r\n      The superstition of the people was not imbittered by any mixture\r\n      of theological rancor; nor was it confined by the chains of any\r\n      speculative system. The devout polytheist, though fondly attached\r\n      to his national rites, admitted with implicit faith the different\r\n      religions of the earth. 3 Fear, gratitude, and curiosity, a dream\r\n      or an omen, a singular disorder, or a distant journey,\r\n      perpetually disposed him to multiply the articles of his belief,\r\n      and to enlarge the list of his protectors. The thin texture of\r\n      the Pagan mythology was interwoven with various but not\r\n      discordant materials. As soon as it was allowed that sages and\r\n      heroes, who had lived or who had died for the benefit of their\r\n      country, were exalted to a state of power and immortality, it was\r\n      universally confessed, that they deserved, if not the adoration,\r\n      at least the reverence, of all mankind. The deities of a thousand\r\n      groves and a thousand streams possessed, in peace, their local\r\n      and respective influence; nor could the Romans who deprecated the\r\n      wrath of the Tiber, deride the Egyptian who presented his\r\n      offering to the beneficent genius of the Nile. The visible powers\r\n      of nature, the planets, and the elements were the same throughout\r\n      the universe. The invisible governors of the moral world were\r\n      inevitably cast in a similar mould of fiction and allegory. Every\r\n      virtue, and even vice, acquired its divine representative; every\r\n      art and profession its patron, whose attributes, in the most\r\n      distant ages and countries, were uniformly derived from the\r\n      character of their peculiar votaries. A republic of gods of such\r\n      opposite tempers and interests required, in every system, the\r\n      moderating hand of a supreme magistrate, who, by the progress of\r\n      knowledge and flattery, was gradually invested with the sublime\r\n      perfections of an Eternal Parent, and an Omnipotent Monarch. 4\r\n      Such was the mild spirit of antiquity, that the nations were less\r\n      attentive to the difference, than to the resemblance, of their\r\n      religious worship. The Greek, the Roman, and the Barbarian, as\r\n      they met before their respective altars, easily persuaded\r\n      themselves, that under various names, and with various\r\n      ceremonies, they adored the same deities. 5 The elegant mythology\r\n      of Homer gave a beautiful, and almost a regular form, to the\r\n      polytheism of the ancient world.\r\n\r\n      3 (return) [ There is not any writer who describes in so lively a\r\n      manner as Herodotus the true genius of polytheism.

The polytheistic nations, tolerant as they\r\n      were towards each other, as separate states, were not the less\r\n      ignorant of the eternal principle, the only basis of enlightened\r\n      toleration, that every one has a right to worship God in the\r\n      manner which seems to him the best. Citizens, on the contrary,\r\n      were bound to conform to the religion of the state; they had not\r\n      the liberty to adopt a foreign religion, though that religion\r\n      might be legally recognized in their own city, for the strangers\r\n      who were its votaries.” —Sur la Religion, v. 184.

At this time, the growing religious indifference,\r\n      and the general administration of the empire by Romans, who,\r\n      being strangers, would do no more than protect, not enlist\r\n      themselves in the cause of the local superstitions, had\r\n      introduced great laxity.

They meditated, however, on\r\n      the Divine Nature, as a very curious and important speculation;\r\n      and in the profound inquiry, they displayed the strength and\r\n      weakness of the human understanding. 6 Of the four most\r\n      celebrated schools, the Stoics and the Platonists endeavored to\r\n      reconcile the jaring interests of reason and piety. They have\r\n      left us the most sublime proofs of the existence and perfections\r\n      of the first cause; but, as it was impossible for them to\r\n      conceive the creation of matter, the workman in the Stoic\r\n      philosophy was not sufficiently distinguished from the work;\r\n      whilst, on the contrary, the spiritual God of Plato and his\r\n      disciples resembled an idea, rather than a substance. The\r\n      opinions of the Academics and Epicureans were of a less religious\r\n      cast; but whilst the modest science of the former induced them to\r\n      doubt, the positive ignorance of the latter urged them to deny,\r\n      the providence of a Supreme Ruler. The spirit of inquiry,\r\n      prompted by emulation, and supported by freedom, had divided the\r\n      public teachers of philosophy into a variety of contending sects;\r\n      but the ingenious youth, who, from every part, resorted to\r\n      Athens, and the other seats of learning in the Roman empire, were\r\n      alike instructed in every school to reject and to despise the\r\n      religion of the multitude. How, indeed, was it possible that a\r\n      philosopher should accept, as divine truths, the idle tales of\r\n      the poets, and the incoherent traditions of antiquity; or that he\r\n      should adore, as gods, those imperfect beings whom he must have\r\n      despised, as men? Against such unworthy adversaries, Cicero\r\n      condescended to employ the arms of reason and eloquence; but the\r\n      satire of Lucian was a much more adequate, as well as more\r\n      efficacious, weapon. We may be well assured, that a writer,\r\n      conversant with the world, would never have ventured to expose\r\n      the gods of his country to public ridicule, had they not already\r\n      been the objects of secret contempt among the polished and\r\n      enlightened orders of society. 7\r\n\r\n      6 (return) [ The admirable work of Cicero de Natura Deorum is the\r\n      best clew we have to guide us through the dark and profound\r\n      abyss.

In their\r\n      writings and conversation, the philosophers of antiquity asserted\r\n      the independent dignity of reason; but they resigned their\r\n      actions to the commands of law and of custom. Viewing, with a\r\n      smile of pity and indulgence, the various errors of the vulgar,\r\n      they diligently practised the ceremonies of their fathers,\r\n      devoutly frequented the temples of the gods; and sometimes\r\n      condescending to act a part on the theatre of superstition, they\r\n      concealed the sentiments of an atheist under the sacerdotal\r\n      robes. Reasoners of such a temper were scarcely inclined to\r\n      wrangle about their respective modes of faith, or of worship. It\r\n      was indifferent to them what shape the folly of the multitude\r\n      might choose to assume; and they approached with the same inward\r\n      contempt, and the same external reverence, the altars of the\r\n      Libyan, the Olympian, or the Capitoline Jupiter. 8\r\n\r\n      8 (return) [ Socrates, Epicurus, Cicero, and Plutarch always\r\n      inculcated a decent reverence for the religion of their own\r\n      country, and of mankind.

Lært. x. 10.]\r\n\r\n      It is not easy to conceive from what motives a spirit of\r\n      persecution could introduce itself into the Roman councils. The\r\n      magistrates could not be actuated by a blind, though honest\r\n      bigotry, since the magistrates were themselves philosophers; and\r\n      the schools of Athens had given laws to the senate. They could\r\n      not be impelled by ambition or avarice, as the temporal and\r\n      ecclesiastical powers were united in the same hands. The pontiffs\r\n      were chosen among the most illustrious of the senators; and the\r\n      office of Supreme Pontiff was constantly exercised by the\r\n      emperors themselves. They knew and valued the advantages of\r\n      religion, as it is connected with civil government. They\r\n      encouraged the public festivals which humanize the manners of the\r\n      people. They managed the arts of divination as a convenient\r\n      instrument of policy; and they respected, as the firmest bond of\r\n      society, the useful persuasion, that, either in this or in a\r\n      future life, the crime of perjury is most assuredly punished by\r\n      the avenging gods. 9 But whilst they acknowledged the general\r\n      advantages of religion, they were convinced that the various\r\n      modes of worship contributed alike to the same salutary purposes;\r\n      and that, in every country, the form of superstition, which had\r\n      received the sanction of time and experience, was the best\r\n      adapted to the climate, and to its inhabitants. Avarice and taste\r\n      very frequently despoiled the vanquished nations of the elegant\r\n      statues of their gods, and the rich ornaments of their temples;\r\n      10 but, in the exercise of the religion which they derived from\r\n      their ancestors, they uniformly experienced the indulgence, and\r\n      even protection, of the Roman conquerors. The province of Gaul\r\n      seems, and indeed only seems, an exception to this universal\r\n      toleration. Under the specious pretext of abolishing human\r\n      sacrifices, the emperors Tiberius and Claudius suppressed the\r\n      dangerous power of the Druids: 11 but the priests themselves,\r\n      their gods and their altars, subsisted in peaceful obscurity till\r\n      the final destruction of Paganism. 12\r\n\r\n      9 (return) [ Polybius, l. vi. c. 53, 54.

The narrow policy of preserving, without any foreign mixture,\r\n      the pure blood of the ancient citizens, had checked the fortune,\r\n      and hastened the ruin, of Athens and Sparta. The aspiring genius\r\n      of Rome sacrificed vanity to ambition, and deemed it more\r\n      prudent, as well as honorable, to adopt virtue and merit for her\r\n      own wheresoever they were found, among slaves or strangers,\r\n      enemies or barbarians. 20 During the most flourishing æra of the\r\n      Athenian commonwealth, the number of citizens gradually decreased\r\n      from about thirty 21 to twenty-one thousand. 22 If, on the\r\n      contrary, we study the growth of the Roman republic, we may\r\n      discover, that, notwithstanding the incessant demands of wars and\r\n      colonies, the citizens, who, in the first census of Servius\r\n      Tullius, amounted to no more than eighty-three thousand, were\r\n      multiplied, before the commencement of the social war, to the\r\n      number of four hundred and sixty-three thousand men, able to bear\r\n      arms in the service of their country. 23 When the allies of Rome\r\n      claimed an equal share of honors and privileges, the senate\r\n      indeed preferred the chance of arms to an ignominious concession.\r\n      The Samnites and the Lucanians paid the severe penalty of their\r\n      rashness; but the rest of the Italian states, as they\r\n      successively returned to their duty, were admitted into the bosom\r\n      of the republic, 24 and soon contributed to the ruin of public\r\n      freedom. Under a democratical government, the citizens exercise\r\n      the powers of sovereignty; and those powers will be first abused,\r\n      and afterwards lost, if they are committed to an unwieldy\r\n      multitude. But when the popular assemblies had been suppressed by\r\n      the administration of the emperors, the conquerors were\r\n      distinguished from the vanquished nations, only as the first and\r\n      most honorable order of subjects; and their increase, however\r\n      rapid, was no longer exposed to the same dangers.

Those\r\n      princes, whom the ostentation of gratitude or generosity\r\n      permitted for a while to hold a precarious sceptre, were\r\n      dismissed from their thrones, as soon as they had performed their\r\n      appointed task of fashioning to the yoke the vanquished nations.\r\n      The free states and cities which had embraced the cause of Rome\r\n      were rewarded with a nominal alliance, and insensibly sunk into\r\n      real servitude. The public authority was everywhere exercised by\r\n      the ministers of the senate and of the emperors, and that\r\n      authority was absolute, and without control. 291 But the same\r\n      salutary maxims of government, which had secured the peace and\r\n      obedience of Italy were extended to the most distant conquests. A\r\n      nation of Romans was gradually formed in the provinces, by the\r\n      double expedient of introducing colonies, and of admitting the\r\n      most faithful and deserving of the provincials to the freedom of\r\n      Rome.\r\n\r\n      28 (return) [ See Pausanias, l. vii.

But after the legions were rendered permanent by\r\n      the emperors, the provinces were peopled by a race of soldiers;\r\n      and the veterans, whether they received the reward of their\r\n      service in land or in money, usually settled with their families\r\n      in the country, where they had honorably spent their youth.\r\n      Throughout the empire, but more particularly in the western\r\n      parts, the most fertile districts, and the most convenient\r\n      situations, were reserved for the establishment of colonies; some\r\n      of which were of a civil, and others of a military nature. In\r\n      their manners and internal policy, the colonies formed a perfect\r\n      representation of their great parent; and they were soon endeared\r\n      to the natives by the ties of friendship and alliance, they\r\n      effectually diffused a reverence for the Roman name, and a\r\n      desire, which was seldom disappointed, of sharing, in due time,\r\n      its honors and advantages. 32 The municipal cities insensibly\r\n      equalled the rank and splendor of the colonies; and in the reign\r\n      of Hadrian, it was disputed which was the preferable condition,\r\n      of those societies which had issued from, or those which had been\r\n      received into, the bosom of Rome. 33 The right of Latium, as it\r\n      was called, 331 conferred on the cities to which it had been\r\n      granted, a more partial favor. The magistrates only, at the\r\n      expiration of their office, assumed the quality of Roman\r\n      citizens; but as those offices were annual, in a few years they\r\n      circulated round the principal families. 34 Those of the\r\n      provincials who were permitted to bear arms in the legions; 35\r\n      those who exercised any civil employment; all, in a word, who\r\n      performed any public service, or displayed any personal talents,\r\n      were rewarded with a present, whose value was continually\r\n      diminished by the increasing liberality of the emperors. Yet\r\n      even, in the age of the Antonines, when the freedom of the city\r\n      had been bestowed on the greater number of their subjects, it was\r\n      still accompanied with very solid advantages. The bulk of the\r\n      people acquired, with that title, the benefit of the Roman laws,\r\n      particularly in the interesting articles of marriage, testaments,\r\n      and inheritances; and the road of fortune was open to those whose\r\n      pretensions were seconded by favor or merit. The grandsons of the\r\n      Gauls, who had besieged Julius Cæsar in Alesia, commanded\r\n      legions, governed provinces, and were admitted into the senate of\r\n      Rome. 36 Their ambition, instead of disturbing the tranquillity\r\n      of the state, was intimately connected with its safety and\r\n      greatness.\r\n\r\n      30 (return) [ Seneca in Consolat. ad Helviam, c. 6.]\r\n\r\n      31 (return) [ Memnon apud Photium, (c. 33,) [c. 224, p. 231, ed\r\n      Bekker.] Valer.

This obvious difference marked the two portions of\r\n      the empire with a distinction of colors, which, though it was in\r\n      some degree concealed during the meridian splendor of prosperity,\r\n      became gradually more visible, as the shades of night descended\r\n      upon the Roman world. The western countries were civilized by the\r\n      same hands which subdued them. As soon as the barbarians were\r\n      reconciled to obedience, their minds were open to any new\r\n      impressions of knowledge and politeness. The language of Virgil\r\n      and Cicero, though with some inevitable mixture of corruption,\r\n      was so universally adopted in Africa, Spain, Gaul, Britain, and\r\n      Pannonia, 38 that the faint traces of the Punic or Celtic idioms\r\n      were preserved only in the mountains, or among the peasants. 39\r\n      Education and study insensibly inspired the natives of those\r\n      countries with the sentiments of Romans; and Italy gave fashions,\r\n      as well as laws, to her Latin provincials. They solicited with\r\n      more ardor, and obtained with more facility, the freedom and\r\n      honors of the state; supported the national dignity in letters 40\r\n      and in arms; and at length, in the person of Trajan, produced an\r\n      emperor whom the Scipios would not have disowned for their\r\n      countryman. The situation of the Greeks was very different from\r\n      that of the barbarians. The former had been long since civilized\r\n      and corrupted. They had too much taste to relinquish their\r\n      language, and too much vanity to adopt any foreign institutions.\r\n      Still preserving the prejudices, after they had lost the virtues,\r\n      of their ancestors, they affected to despise the unpolished\r\n      manners of the Roman conquerors, whilst they were compelled to\r\n      respect their superior wisdom and power. 41 Nor was the influence\r\n      of the Grecian language and sentiments confined to the narrow\r\n      limits of that once celebrated country. Their empire, by the\r\n      progress of colonies and conquest, had been diffused from the\r\n      Adriatic to the Euphrates and the Nile. Asia was covered with\r\n      Greek cities, and the long reign of the Macedonian kings had\r\n      introduced a silent revolution into Syria and Egypt. In their\r\n      pompous courts, those princes united the elegance of Athens with\r\n      the luxury of the East, and the example of the court was\r\n      imitated, at an humble distance, by the higher ranks of their\r\n      subjects. Such was the general division of the Roman empire into\r\n      the Latin and Greek languages. To these we may add a third\r\n      distinction for the body of the natives in Syria, and especially\r\n      in Egypt, the use of their ancient dialects, by secluding them\r\n      from the commerce of mankind, checked the improvements of those\r\n      barbarians. 42 The slothful effeminacy of the former exposed them\r\n      to the contempt, the sullen ferociousness of the latter excited\r\n      the aversion, of the conquerors. 43 Those nations had submitted\r\n      to the Roman power, but they seldom desired or deserved the\r\n      freedom of the city: and it was remarked, that more than two\r\n      hundred and thirty years elapsed after the ruin of the Ptolemies,\r\n      before an Egyptian was admitted into the senate of Rome. 44\r\n\r\n      37 (return) [ See Plin.

Those immortal writers who\r\n      still command the admiration of modern Europe, soon became the\r\n      favorite object of study and imitation in Italy and the western\r\n      provinces. But the elegant amusements of the Romans were not\r\n      suffered to interfere with their sound maxims of policy. Whilst\r\n      they acknowledged the charms of the Greek, they asserted the\r\n      dignity of the Latin tongue, and the exclusive use of the latter\r\n      was inflexibly maintained in the administration of civil as well\r\n      as military government. 45 The two languages exercised at the\r\n      same time their separate jurisdiction throughout the empire: the\r\n      former, as the natural idiom of science; the latter, as the legal\r\n      dialect of public transactions. Those who united letters with\r\n      business were equally conversant with both; and it was almost\r\n      impossible, in any province, to find a Roman subject, of a\r\n      liberal education, who was at once a stranger to the Greek and to\r\n      the Latin language.\r\n\r\n      45 (return) [ See Valerius Maximus, l. ii. c. 2, n. 2.

Dion. l. lvii. c. 15.—M]\r\n\r\n      It was by such institutions that the nations of the empire\r\n      insensibly melted away into the Roman name and people. But there\r\n      still remained, in the centre of every province and of every\r\n      family, an unhappy condition of men who endured the weight,\r\n      without sharing the benefits, of society. In the free states of\r\n      antiquity, the domestic slaves were exposed to the wanton rigor\r\n      of despotism. The perfect settlement of the Roman empire was\r\n      preceded by ages of violence and rapine. The slaves consisted,\r\n      for the most part, of barbarian captives, 451 taken in thousands\r\n      by the chance of war, purchased at a vile price, 46 accustomed to\r\n      a life of independence, and impatient to break and to revenge\r\n      their fetters. Against such internal enemies, whose desperate\r\n      insurrections had more than once reduced the republic to the\r\n      brink of destruction, 47 the most severe 471 regulations, 48 and\r\n      the most cruel treatment, seemed almost justified by the great\r\n      law of self-preservation. But when the principal nations of\r\n      Europe, Asia, and Africa were united under the laws of one\r\n      sovereign, the source of foreign supplies flowed with much less\r\n      abundance, and the Romans were reduced to the milder but more\r\n      tedious method of propagation. 481 In their numerous families,\r\n      and particularly in their country estates, they encouraged the\r\n      marriage of their slaves. 482 The sentiments of nature, the\r\n      habits of education, and the possession of a dependent species of\r\n      property, contributed to alleviate the hardships of servitude. 49\r\n      The existence of a slave became an object of greater value, and\r\n      though his happiness still depended on the temper and\r\n      circumstances of the master, the humanity of the latter, instead\r\n      of being restrained by fear, was encouraged by the sense of his\r\n      own interest. The progress of manners was accelerated by the\r\n      virtue or policy of the emperors; and by the edicts of Hadrian\r\n      and the Antonines, the protection of the laws was extended to the\r\n      most abject part of mankind. The jurisdiction of life and death\r\n      over the slaves, a power long exercised and often abused, was\r\n      taken out of private hands, and reserved to the magistrates\r\n      alone. The subterraneous prisons were abolished; and, upon a just\r\n      complaint of intolerable treatment, the injured slave obtained\r\n      either his deliverance, or a less cruel master. 50\r\n\r\n      451 (return) [ It was this which rendered the wars so sanguinary,\r\n      and the battles so obstinate. The immortal Robertson, in an\r\n      excellent discourse on the state of the world at the period of\r\n      the establishment of Christianity, has traced a picture of the\r\n      melancholy effects of slavery, in which we find all the depth of\r\n      his views and the strength of his mind. I shall oppose\r\n      successively some passages to the reflections of Gibbon. The\r\n      reader will see, not without interest, the truths which Gibbon\r\n      appears to have mistaken or voluntarily neglected, developed by\r\n      one of the best of modern historians. It is important to call\r\n      them to mind here, in order to establish the facts and their\r\n      consequences with accuracy. I shall more than once have occasion\r\n      to employ, for this purpose, the discourse of Robertson.\r\n      “Captives taken in war were, in all probability, the first\r\n      persons subjected to perpetual servitude; and, when the\r\n      necessities or luxury of mankind increased the demand for slaves,\r\n      every new war recruited their number, by reducing the vanquished\r\n      to that wretched condition. Hence proceeded the fierce and\r\n      desperate spirit with which wars were carried on among ancient\r\n      nations. While chains and slavery were the certain lot of the\r\n      conquered, battles were fought, and towns defended with a rage\r\n      and obstinacy which nothing but horror at such a fate could have\r\n      inspired; but, putting an end to the cruel institution of\r\n      slavery, Christianity extended its mild influences to the\r\n      practice of war, and that barbarous art, softened by its humane\r\n      spirit, ceased to be so destructive. Secure, in every event, of\r\n      personal liberty, the resistance of the vanquished became less\r\n      obstinate, and the triumph of the victor less cruel. Thus\r\n      humanity was introduced into the exercise of war, with which it\r\n      appears to be almost incompatible; and it is to the merciful\r\n      maxims of Christianity, much more than to any other cause, that\r\n      we must ascribe the little ferocity and bloodshed which accompany\r\n      modern victories.”—G.]\r\n\r\n      46 (return) [ In the camp of Lucullus, an ox sold for a drachma,\r\n      and a slave for four drachmæ, or about three shillings.

The prætor, struck by the dexterity and\r\n      courage of the man, desired to see him. The poor wretch, highly\r\n      gratified with the distinction, came to present himself before\r\n      the prætor, in hopes, no doubt, of praise and reward; but\r\n      Domitius, on learning that he had only a javelin to attack and\r\n      kill the boar, ordered him to be instantly crucified, under the\r\n      barbarous pretext that the law prohibited the use of this weapon,\r\n      as of all others, to slaves.” Perhaps the cruelty of Domitius is\r\n      less astonishing than the indifference with which the Roman\r\n      orator relates this circumstance, which affects him so little\r\n      that he thus expresses himself: “Durum hoc fortasse videatur,\r\n      neque ego in ullam partem disputo.” “This may appear harsh, nor\r\n      do I give any opinion on the subject.” And it is the same orator\r\n      who exclaims in the same oration, “Facinus est cruciare civem\r\n      Romanum; scelus verberare; prope parricidium necare: quid dicam\r\n      in crucem tollere?” “It is a crime to imprison a Roman citizen;\r\n      wickedness to scourge; next to parricide to put to death, what\r\n      shall I call it to crucify?”\r\n\r\n      In general, this passage of Gibbon on slavery, is full, not only\r\n      of blamable indifference, but of an exaggeration of impartiality\r\n      which resembles dishonesty. He endeavors to extenuate all that is\r\n      appalling in the condition and treatment of the slaves; he would\r\n      make us consider those cruelties as possibly “justified by\r\n      necessity.” He then describes, with minute accuracy, the\r\n      slightest mitigations of their deplorable condition; he\r\n      attributes to the virtue or the policy of the emperors the\r\n      progressive amelioration in the lot of the slaves; and he passes\r\n      over in silence the most influential cause, that which, after\r\n      rendering the slaves less miserable, has contributed at length\r\n      entirely to enfranchise them from their sufferings and their\r\n      chains,—Christianity. It would be easy to accumulate the most\r\n      frightful, the most agonizing details, of the manner in which the\r\n      Romans treated their slaves; whole works have been devoted to the\r\n      description.

Some\r\n      reflections of Robertson, taken from the discourse already\r\n      quoted, will make us feel that Gibbon, in tracing the mitigation\r\n      of the condition of the slaves, up to a period little later than\r\n      that which witnessed the establishment of Christianity in the\r\n      world, could not have avoided the acknowledgment of the influence\r\n      of that beneficent cause, if he had not already determined not to\r\n      speak of it.\r\n\r\n      “Upon establishing despotic government in the Roman empire,\r\n      domestic tyranny rose, in a short time, to an astonishing height.\r\n      In that rank soil, every vice, which power nourishes in the\r\n      great, or oppression engenders in the mean, thrived and grew up\r\n      apace. * * * It is not the authority of any single detached\r\n      precept in the gospel, but the spirit and genius of the Christian\r\n      religion, more powerful than any particular command, which hath\r\n      abolished the practice of slavery throughout the world. The\r\n      temper which Christianity inspired was mild and gentle; and the\r\n      doctrines it taught added such dignity and lustre to human\r\n      nature, as rescued it from the dishonorable servitude into which\r\n      it was sunk.”\r\n\r\n      It is in vain, then, that Gibbon pretends to attribute solely to\r\n      the desire of keeping up the number of slaves, the milder conduct\r\n      which the Romans began to adopt in their favor at the time of the\r\n      emperors. This cause had hitherto acted in an opposite direction;\r\n      how came it on a sudden to have a different influence? “The\r\n      masters,” he says, “encouraged the marriage of their slaves; * *\r\n      * the sentiments of nature, the habits of education, contributed\r\n      to alleviate the hardships of servitude.” The children of slaves\r\n      were the property of their master, who could dispose of or\r\n      alienate them like the rest of his property. Is it in such a\r\n      situation, with such notions, that the sentiments of nature\r\n      unfold themselves, or habits of education become mild and\r\n      peaceful? We must not attribute to causes inadequate or\r\n      altogether without force, effects which require to explain them a\r\n      reference to more influential causes; and even if these slighter\r\n      causes had in effect a manifest influence, we must not forget\r\n      that they are themselves the effect of a primary, a higher, and\r\n      more extensive cause, which, in giving to the mind and to the\r\n      character a more disinterested and more humane bias, disposed men\r\n      to second or themselves to advance, by their conduct, and by the\r\n      change of manners, the happy results which it tended to\r\n      produce.—G.\r\n\r\n      I have retained the whole of M. Guizot’s note, though, in his\r\n      zeal for the invaluable blessings of freedom and Christianity, he\r\n      has done Gibbon injustice. The condition of the slaves was\r\n      undoubtedly improved under the emperors. What a great authority\r\n      has said, “The condition of a slave is better under an arbitrary\r\n      than under a free government,” (Smith’s Wealth of Nations, iv.\r\n      7,) is, I believe, supported by the history of all ages and\r\n      nations. The protecting edicts of Hadrian and the Antonines are\r\n      historical facts, and can as little be attributed to the\r\n      influence of Christianity, as the milder language of heathen\r\n      writers, of Seneca, (particularly Ep. 47,) of Pliny, and of\r\n      Plutarch. The latter influence of Christianity is admitted by\r\n      Gibbon himself. The subject of Roman slavery has recently been\r\n      investigated with great diligence in a very modest but valuable\r\n      volume, by Wm. Blair, Esq., Edin. 1833. May we be permitted,\r\n      while on the subject, to refer to the most splendid passage\r\n      extant of Mr. Pitt’s eloquence, the description of the Roman\r\n      slave-dealer. on the shores of Britain, condemning the island to\r\n      irreclaimable barbarism, as a perpetual and prolific nursery of\r\n      slaves?

The increase in their population was\r\n      not sufficient, and recourse was had to the purchase of slaves,\r\n      which was made even in the provinces of the East subject to the\r\n      Romans. It is, moreover, known that slavery is a state little\r\n      favorable to population. (See Hume’s Essay, and Malthus on\r\n      population, i. 334.—G.) The testimony of Appian (B.C. l. i. c. 7)\r\n      is decisive in favor of the rapid multiplication of the\r\n      agricultural slaves; it is confirmed by the numbers engaged in\r\n      the servile wars.

The benevolence of\r\n      the master was so frequently prompted by the meaner suggestions\r\n      of vanity and avarice, that the laws found it more necessary to\r\n      restrain than to encourage a profuse and undistinguishing\r\n      liberality, which might degenerate into a very dangerous abuse.\r\n      51 It was a maxim of ancient jurisprudence, that a slave had not\r\n      any country of his own; he acquired with his liberty an admission\r\n      into the political society of which his patron was a member. The\r\n      consequences of this maxim would have prostituted the privileges\r\n      of the Roman city to a mean and promiscuous multitude. Some\r\n      seasonable exceptions were therefore provided; and the honorable\r\n      distinction was confined to such slaves only as, for just causes,\r\n      and with the approbation of the magistrate, should receive a\r\n      solemn and legal manumission. Even these chosen freedmen obtained\r\n      no more than the private rights of citizens, and were rigorously\r\n      excluded from civil or military honors. Whatever might be the\r\n      merit or fortune of their sons, _they_ likewise were esteemed\r\n      unworthy of a seat in the senate; nor were the traces of a\r\n      servile origin allowed to be completely obliterated till the\r\n      third or fourth generation. 52 Without destroying the distinction\r\n      of ranks, a distant prospect of freedom and honors was presented,\r\n      even to those whom pride and prejudice almost disdained to number\r\n      among the human species.\r\n\r\n      51 (return) [ See another Dissertation of M. de Burigny, in the\r\n      xxxviith volume, on the Roman freedmen.]\r\n\r\n      52 (return) [ Spanheim, Orbis Roman. l. i. c. 16, p. 124, &c.] It\r\n      was once proposed to discriminate the slaves by a peculiar habit;\r\n      but it was justly apprehended that there might be some danger in\r\n      acquainting them with their own numbers. 53 Without interpreting,\r\n      in their utmost strictness, the liberal appellations of legions\r\n      and myriads, 54 we may venture to pronounce, that the proportion\r\n      of slaves, who were valued as property, was more considerable\r\n      than that of servants, who can be computed only as an expense. 55\r\n      The youths of a promising genius were instructed in the arts and\r\n      sciences, and their price was ascertained by the degree of their\r\n      skill and talents. 56 Almost every profession, either liberal 57\r\n      or mechanical, might be found in the household of an opulent\r\n      senator. The ministers of pomp and sensuality were multiplied\r\n      beyond the conception of modern luxury. 58 It was more for the\r\n      interest of the merchant or manufacturer to purchase, than to\r\n      hire his workmen; and in the country, slaves were employed as the\r\n      cheapest and most laborious instruments of agriculture. To\r\n      confirm the general observation, and to display the multitude of\r\n      slaves, we might allege a variety of particular instances. It was\r\n      discovered, on a very melancholy occasion, that four hundred\r\n      slaves were maintained in a single palace of Rome. 59 The same\r\n      number of four hundred belonged to an estate which an African\r\n      widow, of a very private condition, resigned to her son, whilst\r\n      she reserved for herself a much larger share of her property. 60\r\n      A freedman, under the name of Augustus, though his fortune had\r\n      suffered great losses in the civil wars, left behind him three\r\n      thousand six hundred yoke of oxen, two hundred and fifty thousand\r\n      head of smaller cattle, and what was almost included in the\r\n      description of cattle, four thousand one hundred and sixteen\r\n      slaves. 61\r\n\r\n      53 (return) [ Seneca de Clementia, l. i. c. 24.

We are informed, that when the Emperor Claudius\r\n      exercised the office of censor, he took an account of six\r\n      millions nine hundred and forty-five thousand Roman citizens,\r\n      who, with the proportion of women and children, must have\r\n      amounted to about twenty millions of souls. The multitude of\r\n      subjects of an inferior rank was uncertain and fluctuating. But,\r\n      after weighing with attention every circumstance which could\r\n      influence the balance, it seems probable that there existed, in\r\n      the time of Claudius, about twice as many provincials as there\r\n      were citizens, of either sex, and of every age; and that the\r\n      slaves were at least equal in number to the free inhabitants of\r\n      the Roman world.611 The total amount of this imperfect\r\n      calculation would rise to about one hundred and twenty millions\r\n      of persons; a degree of population which possibly exceeds that of\r\n      modern Europe, 62 and forms the most numerous society that has\r\n      ever been united under the same system of government.\r\n\r\n      611] ( return)\r\n      [ According to Robertson, there were twice as many slaves as free\r\n      citizens.—G. Mr. Blair (p. 15) estimates three slaves to one\r\n      freeman, between the conquest of Greece, B.C. 146, and the reign\r\n      of Alexander Severus, A. D. 222, 235. The proportion was probably\r\n      larger in Italy than in the provinces.—M. On the other hand,\r\n      Zumpt, in his Dissertation quoted below, (p. 86,) asserts it to\r\n      be a gross error in Gibbon to reckon the number of slaves equal\r\n      to that of the free population. The luxury and magnificence of\r\n      the great, (he observes,) at the commencement of the empire, must\r\n      not be taken as the groundwork of calculations for the whole\r\n      Roman world. “The agricultural laborer, and the artisan, in\r\n      Spain, Gaul, Britain, Syria, and Egypt, maintained himself, as in\r\n      the present day, by his own labor and that of his household,\r\n      without possessing a single slave.” The latter part of my note\r\n      was intended to suggest this consideration. Yet so completely was\r\n      slavery rooted in the social system, both in the east and the\r\n      west, that in the great diffusion of wealth at this time, every\r\n      one, I doubt not, who could afford a domestic slave, kept one;\r\n      and generally, the number of slaves was in proportion to the\r\n      wealth. I do not believe that the cultivation of the soil by\r\n      slaves was confined to Italy; the holders of large estates in the\r\n      provinces would probably, either from choice or necessity, adopt\r\n      the same mode of cultivation. The latifundia, says Pliny, had\r\n      ruined Italy, and had begun to ruin the provinces. Slaves were no\r\n      doubt employed in agricultural labor to a great extent in Sicily,\r\n      and were the estates of those six enormous landholders who were\r\n      said to have possessed the whole province of Africa, cultivated\r\n      altogether by free coloni? Whatever may have been the case in the\r\n      rural districts, in the towns and cities the household duties\r\n      were almost entirely discharged by slaves, and vast numbers\r\n      belonged to the public establishments. I do not, however, differ\r\n      so far from Zumpt, and from M. Dureau de la Malle, as to adopt\r\n      the higher and bolder estimate of Robertson and Mr. Blair, rather\r\n      than the more cautious suggestions of Gibbon. I would reduce\r\n      rather than increase the proportion of the slave population. The\r\n      very ingenious and elaborate calculations of the French writer,\r\n      by which he deduces the amount of the population from the produce\r\n      and consumption of corn in Italy, appear to me neither precise\r\n      nor satisfactory bases for such complicated political arithmetic.\r\n      I am least satisfied with his views as to the population of the\r\n      city of Rome; but this point will be more fitly reserved for a\r\n      note on the thirty-first chapter of Gibbon.

Zumpt, in a dissertation printed in the\r\n      Transactions of the Berlin Academy, 1840. M. Dureau de la Malle\r\n      confines his inquiry almost entirely to the city of Rome, and\r\n      Roman Italy. Zumpt examines at greater length the axiom, which he\r\n      supposes to have been assumed by Gibbon as unquestionable, “that\r\n      Italy and the Roman world was never so populous as in the time of\r\n      the Antonines.” Though this probably was Gibbon’s opinion, he has\r\n      not stated it so peremptorily as asserted by Mr. Zumpt. It had\r\n      before been expressly laid down by Hume, and his statement was\r\n      controverted by Wallace and by Malthus. Gibbon says (p. 84) that\r\n      there is no reason to believe the country (of Italy) less\r\n      populous in the age of the Antonines, than in that of Romulus;\r\n      and Zumpt acknowledges that we have no satisfactory knowledge of\r\n      the state of Italy at that early age. Zumpt, in my opinion with\r\n      some reason, takes the period just before the first Punic war, as\r\n      that in which Roman Italy (all south of the Rubicon) was most\r\n      populous. From that time, the numbers began to diminish, at first\r\n      from the enormous waste of life out of the free population in the\r\n      foreign, and afterwards in the civil wars; from the cultivation\r\n      of the soil by slaves; towards the close of the republic, from\r\n      the repugnance to marriage, which resisted alike the dread of\r\n      legal punishment and the offer of legal immunity and privilege;\r\n      and from the depravity of manners, which interfered with the\r\n      procreation, the birth, and the rearing of children. The\r\n      arguments and the authorities of Zumpt are equally conclusive as\r\n      to the decline of population in Greece. Still the details, which\r\n      he himself adduces as to the prosperity and populousness of Asia\r\n      Minor, and the whole of the Roman East, with the advancement of\r\n      the European provinces, especially Gaul, Spain, and Britain, in\r\n      civilization, and therefore in populousness, (for I have no\r\n      confidence in the vast numbers sometimes assigned to the\r\n      barbarous inhabitants of these countries,) may, I think, fairly\r\n      compensate for any deduction to be made from Gibbon’s general\r\n      estimate on account of Greece and Italy. Gibbon himself\r\n      acknowledges his own estimate to be vague and conjectural; and I\r\n      may venture to recommend the dissertation of Zumpt as deserving\r\n      respectful consideration.—M 1815.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter II: The Internal Prosperity In The Age Of The\r\n      Antonines.—Part III.\r\n\r\n      Domestic peace and union were the natural consequences of the\r\n      moderate and comprehensive policy embraced by the Romans. If we\r\n      turn our eyes towards the monarchies of Asia, we shall behold\r\n      despotism in the centre, and weakness in the extremities; the\r\n      collection of the revenue, or the administration of justice,\r\n      enforced by the presence of an army; hostile barbarians\r\n      established in the heart of the country, hereditary satraps\r\n      usurping the dominion of the provinces, and subjects inclined to\r\n      rebellion, though incapable of freedom. But the obedience of the\r\n      Roman world was uniform, voluntary, and permanent. The vanquished\r\n      nations, blended into one great people, resigned the hope, nay,\r\n      even the wish, of resuming their independence, and scarcely\r\n      considered their own existence as distinct from the existence of\r\n      Rome. The established authority of the emperors pervaded without\r\n      an effort the wide extent of their dominions, and was exercised\r\n      with the same facility on the banks of the Thames, or of the\r\n      Nile, as on those of the Tyber. The legions were destined to\r\n      serve against the public enemy, and the civil magistrate seldom\r\n      required the aid of a military force. 63 In this state of general\r\n      security, the leisure, as well as opulence, both of the prince\r\n      and people, were devoted to improve and to adorn the Roman\r\n      empire.\r\n\r\n      63 (return) [ Joseph. de Bell.

The oration\r\n      of Agrippa, or rather of the historian, is a fine picture of the\r\n      Roman empire.]\r\n\r\n      Among the innumerable monuments of architecture constructed by\r\n      the Romans, how many have escaped the notice of history, how few\r\n      have resisted the ravages of time and barbarism! And yet, even\r\n      the majestic ruins that are still scattered over Italy and the\r\n      provinces, would be sufficient to prove that those countries were\r\n      once the seat of a polite and powerful empire. Their greatness\r\n      alone, or their beauty, might deserve our attention: but they are\r\n      rendered more interesting, by two important circumstances, which\r\n      connect the agreeable history of the arts with the more useful\r\n      history of human manners. Many of those works were erected at\r\n      private expense, and almost all were intended for public benefit.\r\n\r\n      It is natural to suppose that the greatest number, as well as the\r\n      most considerable of the Roman edifices, were raised by the\r\n      emperors, who possessed so unbounded a command both of men and\r\n      money. Augustus was accustomed to boast that he had found his\r\n      capital of brick, and that he had left it of marble. 64 The\r\n      strict economy of Vespasian was the source of his magnificence.\r\n      The works of Trajan bear the stamp of his genius. The public\r\n      monuments with which Hadrian adorned every province of the\r\n      empire, were executed not only by his orders, but under his\r\n      immediate inspection. He was himself an artist; and he loved the\r\n      arts, as they conduced to the glory of the monarch. They were\r\n      encouraged by the Antonines, as they contributed to the happiness\r\n      of the people. But if the emperors were the first, they were not\r\n      the only architects of their dominions. Their example was\r\n      universally imitated by their principal subjects, who were not\r\n      afraid of declaring to the world that they had spirit to\r\n      conceive, and wealth to accomplish, the noblest undertakings.\r\n      Scarcely had the proud structure of the Coliseum been dedicated\r\n      at Rome, before the edifices, of a smaller scale indeed, but of\r\n      the same design and materials, were erected for the use, and at\r\n      the expense, of the cities of Capua and Verona. 65 The\r\n      inscription of the stupendous bridge of Alcantara attests that it\r\n      was thrown over the Tagus by the contribution of a few Lusitanian\r\n      communities. When Pliny was intrusted with the government of\r\n      Bithynia and Pontus, provinces by no means the richest or most\r\n      considerable of the empire, he found the cities within his\r\n      jurisdiction striving with each other in every useful and\r\n      ornamental work, that might deserve the curiosity of strangers,\r\n      or the gratitude of their citizens. It was the duty of the\r\n      proconsul to supply their deficiencies, to direct their taste,\r\n      and sometimes to moderate their emulation. 66 The opulent\r\n      senators of Rome and the provinces esteemed it an honor, and\r\n      almost an obligation, to adorn the splendor of their age and\r\n      country; and the influence of fashion very frequently supplied\r\n      the want of taste or generosity. Among a crowd of these private\r\n      benefactors, we may select Herodes Atticus, an Athenian citizen,\r\n      who lived in the age of the Antonines. Whatever might be the\r\n      motive of his conduct, his magnificence would have been worthy of\r\n      the greatest kings.\r\n\r\n      64 (return) [ Sueton. in August. c. 28.

At Nicomedia, a new forum, an aqueduct, and a canal, left\r\n      unfinished by a king; at Nice, a gymnasium, and a theatre, which\r\n      had already cost near ninety thousand pounds; baths at Prusa and\r\n      Claudiopolis, and an aqueduct of sixteen miles in length for the\r\n      use of Sinope.]\r\n\r\n      The family of Herod, at least after it had been favored by\r\n      fortune, was lineally descended from Cimon and Miltiades, Theseus\r\n      and Cecrops, Æacus and Jupiter. But the posterity of so many gods\r\n      and heroes was fallen into the most abject state. His grandfather\r\n      had suffered by the hands of justice, and Julius Atticus, his\r\n      father, must have ended his life in poverty and contempt, had he\r\n      not discovered an immense treasure buried under an old house, the\r\n      last remains of his patrimony. According to the rigor of the law,\r\n      the emperor might have asserted his claim, and the prudent\r\n      Atticus prevented, by a frank confession, the officiousness of\r\n      informers. But the equitable Nerva, who then filled the throne,\r\n      refused to accept any part of it, and commanded him to use,\r\n      without scruple, the present of fortune. The cautious Athenian\r\n      still insisted, that the treasure was too considerable for a\r\n      subject, and that he knew not how to _use it. Abuse it then_,\r\n      replied the monarch, with a good-natured peevishness; for it is\r\n      your own. 67 Many will be of opinion, that Atticus literally\r\n      obeyed the emperor’s last instructions; since he expended the\r\n      greatest part of his fortune, which was much increased by an\r\n      advantageous marriage, in the service of the public. He had\r\n      obtained for his son Herod the prefecture of the free cities of\r\n      Asia; and the young magistrate, observing that the town of Troas\r\n      was indifferently supplied with water, obtained from the\r\n      munificence of Hadrian three hundred myriads of drachms, (about a\r\n      hundred thousand pounds,) for the construction of a new aqueduct.\r\n      But in the execution of the work, the charge amounted to more\r\n      than double the estimate, and the officers of the revenue began\r\n      to murmur, till the generous Atticus silenced their complaints,\r\n      by requesting that he might be permitted to take upon himself the\r\n      whole additional expense. 68\r\n\r\n      67 (return) [ Hadrian afterwards made a very equitable\r\n      regulation, which divided all treasure-trove between the right of\r\n      property and that of discovery.

Their\r\n      pupil soon became a celebrated orator, according to the useless\r\n      rhetoric of that age, which, confining itself to the schools,\r\n      disdained to visit either the Forum or the Senate.\r\n\r\n      He was honored with the consulship at Rome: but the greatest part\r\n      of his life was spent in a philosophic retirement at Athens, and\r\n      his adjacent villas; perpetually surrounded by sophists, who\r\n      acknowledged, without reluctance, the superiority of a rich and\r\n      generous rival. 69 The monuments of his genius have perished;\r\n      some considerable ruins still preserve the fame of his taste and\r\n      munificence: modern travellers have measured the remains of the\r\n      stadium which he constructed at Athens. It was six hundred feet\r\n      in length, built entirely of white marble, capable of admitting\r\n      the whole body of the people, and finished in four years, whilst\r\n      Herod was president of the Athenian games. To the memory of his\r\n      wife Regilla he dedicated a theatre, scarcely to be paralleled in\r\n      the empire: no wood except cedar, very curiously carved, was\r\n      employed in any part of the building. The Odeum, 691 designed by\r\n      Pericles for musical performances, and the rehearsal of new\r\n      tragedies, had been a trophy of the victory of the arts over\r\n      barbaric greatness; as the timbers employed in the construction\r\n      consisted chiefly of the masts of the Persian vessels.\r\n      Notwithstanding the repairs bestowed on that ancient edifice by a\r\n      king of Cappadocia, it was again fallen to decay. Herod restored\r\n      its ancient beauty and magnificence. Nor was the liberality of\r\n      that illustrious citizen confined to the walls of Athens. The\r\n      most splendid ornaments bestowed on the temple of Neptune in the\r\n      Isthmus, a theatre at Corinth, a stadium at Delphi, a bath at\r\n      Thermopylæ, and an aqueduct at Canusium in Italy, were\r\n      insufficient to exhaust his treasures. The people of Epirus,\r\n      Thessaly, Eubœa, Bœotia, and Peloponnesus, experienced his\r\n      favors; and many inscriptions of the cities of Greece and Asia\r\n      gratefully style Herodes Atticus their patron and benefactor. 70\r\n\r\n      69 (return) [ Aulus Gellius, in Noct.

It was in works of national honor and benefit, that the\r\n      most virtuous of the emperors affected to display their\r\n      magnificence. The golden palace of Nero excited a just\r\n      indignation, but the vast extent of ground which had been usurped\r\n      by his selfish luxury was more nobly filled under the succeeding\r\n      reigns by the Coliseum, the baths of Titus, the Claudian portico,\r\n      and the temples dedicated to the goddess of Peace, and to the\r\n      genius of Rome. 72 These monuments of architecture, the property\r\n      of the Roman people, were adorned with the most beautiful\r\n      productions of Grecian painting and sculpture; and in the temple\r\n      of Peace, a very curious library was open to the curiosity of the\r\n      learned. 721 At a small distance from thence was situated the\r\n      Forum of Trajan. It was surrounded by a lofty portico, in the\r\n      form of a quadrangle, into which four triumphal arches opened a\r\n      noble and spacious entrance: in the centre arose a column of\r\n      marble, whose height, of one hundred and ten feet, denoted the\r\n      elevation of the hill that had been cut away. This column, which\r\n      still subsists in its ancient beauty, exhibited an exact\r\n      representation of the Dacian victories of its founder. The\r\n      veteran soldier contemplated the story of his own campaigns, and\r\n      by an easy illusion of national vanity, the peaceful citizen\r\n      associated himself to the honors of the triumph. All the other\r\n      quarters of the capital, and all the provinces of the empire,\r\n      were embellished by the same liberal spirit of public\r\n      magnificence, and were filled with amphitheatres, theatres,\r\n      temples, porticoes, triumphal arches, baths and aqueducts, all\r\n      variously conducive to the health, the devotion, and the\r\n      pleasures of the meanest citizen. The last mentioned of those\r\n      edifices deserve our peculiar attention. The boldness of the\r\n      enterprise, the solidity of the execution, and the uses to which\r\n      they were subservient, rank the aqueducts among the noblest\r\n      monuments of Roman genius and power. The aqueducts of the capital\r\n      claim a just preeminence; but the curious traveller, who, without\r\n      the light of history, should examine those of Spoleto, of Metz,\r\n      or of Segovia, would very naturally conclude that those\r\n      provincial towns had formerly been the residence of some potent\r\n      monarch. The solitudes of Asia and Africa were once covered with\r\n      flourishing cities, whose populousness, and even whose existence,\r\n      was derived from such artificial supplies of a perennial stream\r\n      of fresh water. 73\r\n\r\n      71 (return) [ It is particularly remarked of Athens by\r\n      Dicæarchus, de Statu Græciæ, p. 8, inter Geographos Minores,\r\n      edit.

The observation of the number and\r\n      greatness of its cities will serve to confirm the former, and to\r\n      multiply the latter. It may not be unpleasing to collect a few\r\n      scattered instances relative to that subject without forgetting,\r\n      however, that from the vanity of nations and the poverty of\r\n      language, the vague appellation of city has been indifferently\r\n      bestowed on Rome and upon Laurentum.\r\n\r\n      I. _Ancient_ Italy is said to have contained eleven hundred and\r\n      ninety-seven cities; and for whatsoever æra of antiquity the\r\n      expression might be intended, 74 there is not any reason to\r\n      believe the country less populous in the age of the Antonines,\r\n      than in that of Romulus. The petty states of Latium were\r\n      contained within the metropolis of the empire, by whose superior\r\n      influence they had been attracted. 741 Those parts of Italy which\r\n      have so long languished under the lazy tyranny of priests and\r\n      viceroys, had been afflicted only by the more tolerable\r\n      calamities of war; and the first symptoms of decay which _they_\r\n      experienced, were amply compensated by the rapid improvements of\r\n      the Cisalpine Gaul. The splendor of Verona may be traced in its\r\n      remains: yet Verona was less celebrated than Aquileia or Padua,\r\n      Milan or Ravenna. II. The spirit of improvement had passed the\r\n      Alps, and been felt even in the woods of Britain, which were\r\n      gradually cleared away to open a free space for convenient and\r\n      elegant habitations. York was the seat of government; London was\r\n      already enriched by commerce; and Bath was celebrated for the\r\n      salutary effects of its medicinal waters. Gaul could boast of her\r\n      twelve hundred cities; 75 and though, in the northern parts, many\r\n      of them, without excepting Paris itself, were little more than\r\n      the rude and imperfect townships of a rising people, the southern\r\n      provinces imitated the wealth and elegance of Italy. 76 Many were\r\n      the cities of Gaul, Marseilles, Arles, Nismes, Narbonne,\r\n      Thoulouse, Bourdeaux, Autun, Vienna, Lyons, Langres, and Treves,\r\n      whose ancient condition might sustain an equal, and perhaps\r\n      advantageous comparison with their present state. With regard to\r\n      Spain, that country flourished as a province, and has declined as\r\n      a kingdom. Exhausted by the abuse of her strength, by America,\r\n      and by superstition, her pride might possibly be confounded, if\r\n      we required such a list of three hundred and sixty cities, as\r\n      Pliny has exhibited under the reign of Vespasian. 77 III. Three\r\n      hundred African cities had once acknowledged the authority of\r\n      Carthage, 78 nor is it likely that their numbers diminished under\r\n      the administration of the emperors: Carthage itself rose with new\r\n      splendor from its ashes; and that capital, as well as Capua and\r\n      Corinth, soon recovered all the advantages which can be separated\r\n      from independent sovereignty. IV. The provinces of the East\r\n      present the contrast of Roman magnificence with Turkish\r\n      barbarism. The ruins of antiquity scattered over uncultivated\r\n      fields, and ascribed, by ignorance, to the power of magic,\r\n      scarcely afford a shelter to the oppressed peasant or wandering\r\n      Arab. Under the reign of the Cæsars, the proper Asia alone\r\n      contained five hundred populous cities, 79 enriched with all the\r\n      gifts of nature, and adorned with all the refinements of art.\r\n      Eleven cities of Asia had once disputed the honor of dedicating a\r\n      temple of Tiberius, and their respective merits were examined by\r\n      the senate. 80 Four of them were immediately rejected as unequal\r\n      to the burden; and among these was Laodicea, whose splendor is\r\n      still displayed in its ruins. 81 Laodicea collected a very\r\n      considerable revenue from its flocks of sheep, celebrated for the\r\n      fineness of their wool, and had received, a little before the\r\n      contest, a legacy of above four hundred thousand pounds by the\r\n      testament of a generous citizen. 82 If such was the poverty of\r\n      Laodicea, what must have been the wealth of those cities, whose\r\n      claim appeared preferable, and particularly of Pergamus, of\r\n      Smyrna, and of Ephesus, who so long disputed with each other the\r\n      titular primacy of Asia? 83 The capitals of Syria and Egypt held\r\n      a still superior rank in the empire; Antioch and Alexandria\r\n      looked down with disdain on a crowd of dependent cities, 84 and\r\n      yielded, with reluctance, to the majesty of Rome itself.\r\n\r\n      74 (return) [ Ælian.

If we carefully\r\n      trace the distance from the wall of Antoninus to Rome, and from\r\n      thence to Jerusalem, it will be found that the great chain of\r\n      communication, from the north-west to the south-east point of the\r\n      empire, was drawn out to the length of four thousand and eighty\r\n      Roman miles. 85 The public roads were accurately divided by\r\n      mile-stones, and ran in a direct line from one city to another,\r\n      with very little respect for the obstacles either of nature or\r\n      private property. Mountains were perforated, and bold arches\r\n      thrown over the broadest and most rapid streams. 86 The middle\r\n      part of the road was raised into a terrace which commanded the\r\n      adjacent country, consisted of several strata of sand, gravel,\r\n      and cement, and was paved with large stones, or, in some places\r\n      near the capital, with granite. 87 Such was the solid\r\n      construction of the Roman highways, whose firmness has not\r\n      entirely yielded to the effort of fifteen centuries. They united\r\n      the subjects of the most distant provinces by an easy and\r\n      familiar intercourse; but their primary object had been to\r\n      facilitate the marches of the legions; nor was any country\r\n      considered as completely subdued, till it had been rendered, in\r\n      all its parts, pervious to the arms and authority of the\r\n      conqueror. The advantage of receiving the earliest intelligence,\r\n      and of conveying their orders with celerity, induced the emperors\r\n      to establish, throughout their extensive dominions, the regular\r\n      institution of posts. 88 Houses were everywhere erected at the\r\n      distance only of five or six miles; each of them was constantly\r\n      provided with forty horses, and by the help of these relays, it\r\n      was easy to travel a hundred miles in a day along the Roman\r\n      roads. 89 891 The use of posts was allowed to those who claimed\r\n      it by an Imperial mandate; but though originally intended for the\r\n      public service, it was sometimes indulged to the business or\r\n      conveniency of private citizens. 90 Nor was the communication of\r\n      the Roman empire less free and open by sea than it was by land.\r\n      The provinces surrounded and enclosed the Mediterranean: and\r\n      Italy, in the shape of an immense promontory, advanced into the\r\n      midst of that great lake. The coasts of Italy are, in general,\r\n      destitute of safe harbors; but human industry had corrected the\r\n      deficiencies of nature; and the artificial port of Ostia, in\r\n      particular, situate at the mouth of the Tyber, and formed by the\r\n      emperor Claudius, was a useful monument of Roman greatness. 91\r\n      From this port, which was only sixteen miles from the capital, a\r\n      favorable breeze frequently carried vessels in seven days to the\r\n      columns of Hercules, and in nine or ten, to Alexandria in Egypt.\r\n      92\r\n\r\n      85 (return) [ The following Itinerary may serve to convey some\r\n      idea of the direction of the road, and of the distance between\r\n      the principal towns.

In the more remote ages of\r\n      antiquity, the world was unequally divided. The East was in the\r\n      immemorial possession of arts and luxury; whilst the West was\r\n      inhabited by rude and warlike barbarians, who either disdained\r\n      agriculture, or to whom it was totally unknown. Under the\r\n      protection of an established government, the productions of\r\n      happier climates, and the industry of more civilized nations,\r\n      were gradually introduced into the western countries of Europe;\r\n      and the natives were encouraged, by an open and profitable\r\n      commerce, to multiply the former, as well as to improve the\r\n      latter. It would be almost impossible to enumerate all the\r\n      articles, either of the animal or the vegetable reign, which were\r\n      successively imported into Europe from Asia and Egypt: 93 but it\r\n      will not be unworthy of the dignity, and much less of the\r\n      utility, of an historical work, slightly to touch on a few of the\r\n      principal heads. 1. Almost all the flowers, the herbs, and the\r\n      fruits, that grow in our European gardens, are of foreign\r\n      extraction, which, in many cases, is betrayed even by their\r\n      names: the apple was a native of Italy, and when the Romans had\r\n      tasted the richer flavor of the apricot, the peach, the\r\n      pomegranate, the citron, and the orange, they contented\r\n      themselves with applying to all these new fruits the common\r\n      denomination of apple, discriminating them from each other by the\r\n      additional epithet of their country. 2. In the time of Homer, the\r\n      vine grew wild in the island of Sicily, and most probably in the\r\n      adjacent continent; but it was not improved by the skill, nor did\r\n      it afford a liquor grateful to the taste, of the savage\r\n      inhabitants. 94 A thousand years afterwards, Italy could boast,\r\n      that of the fourscore most generous and celebrated wines, more\r\n      than two thirds were produced from her soil. 95 The blessing was\r\n      soon communicated to the Narbonnese province of Gaul; but so\r\n      intense was the cold to the north of the Cevennes, that, in the\r\n      time of Strabo, it was thought impossible to ripen the grapes in\r\n      those parts of Gaul. 96 This difficulty, however, was gradually\r\n      vanquished; and there is some reason to believe, that the\r\n      vineyards of Burgundy are as old as the age of the Antonines. 97\r\n      3. The olive, in the western world, followed the progress of\r\n      peace, of which it was considered as the symbol. Two centuries\r\n      after the foundation of Rome, both Italy and Africa were\r\n      strangers to that useful plant: it was naturalized in those\r\n      countries; and at length carried into the heart of Spain and\r\n      Gaul. The timid errors of the ancients, that it required a\r\n      certain degree of heat, and could only flourish in the\r\n      neighborhood of the sea, were insensibly exploded by industry and\r\n      experience. 4. The cultivation of flax was transported from Egypt\r\n      to Gaul, and enriched the whole country, however it might\r\n      impoverish the particular lands on which it was sown. 99 5. The\r\n      use of artificial grasses became familiar to the farmers both of\r\n      Italy and the provinces, particularly the Lucerne, which derived\r\n      its name and origin from Media. 100 The assured supply of\r\n      wholesome and plentiful food for the cattle during winter,\r\n      multiplied the number of the docks and herds, which in their turn\r\n      contributed to the fertility of the soil. To all these\r\n      improvements may be added an assiduous attention to mines and\r\n      fisheries, which, by employing a multitude of laborious hands,\r\n      serve to increase the pleasures of the rich and the subsistence\r\n      of the poor. The elegant treatise of Columella describes the\r\n      advanced state of the Spanish husbandry under the reign of\r\n      Tiberius; and it may be observed, that those famines, which so\r\n      frequently afflicted the infant republic, were seldom or never\r\n      experienced by the extensive empire of Rome. The accidental\r\n      scarcity, in any single province, was immediately relieved by the\r\n      plenty of its more fortunate neighbors.\r\n\r\n      93 (return) [ It is not improbable that the Greeks and Phœnicians\r\n      introduced some new arts and productions into the neighborhood of\r\n      Marseilles and Gades.]\r\n\r\n      94 (return) [ See Homer, Odyss. l. ix. v. 358.]\r\n\r\n      95 (return) [ Plin.

Under the Roman\r\n      empire, the labor of an industrious and ingenious people was\r\n      variously, but incessantly, employed in the service of the rich.\r\n      In their dress, their table, their houses, and their furniture,\r\n      the favorites of fortune united every refinement of conveniency,\r\n      of elegance, and of splendor, whatever could soothe their pride\r\n      or gratify their sensuality. Such refinements, under the odious\r\n      name of luxury, have been severely arraigned by the moralists of\r\n      every age; and it might perhaps be more conducive to the virtue,\r\n      as well as happiness, of mankind, if all possessed the\r\n      necessaries, and none the superfluities, of life. But in the\r\n      present imperfect condition of society, luxury, though it may\r\n      proceed from vice or folly, seems to be the only means that can\r\n      correct the unequal distribution of property. The diligent\r\n      mechanic, and the skilful artist, who have obtained no share in\r\n      the division of the earth, receive a voluntary tax from the\r\n      possessors of land; and the latter are prompted, by a sense of\r\n      interest, to improve those estates, with whose produce they may\r\n      purchase additional pleasures. This operation, the particular\r\n      effects of which are felt in every society, acted with much more\r\n      diffusive energy in the Roman world. The provinces would soon\r\n      have been exhausted of their wealth, if the manufactures and\r\n      commerce of luxury had not insensibly restored to the industrious\r\n      subjects the sums which were exacted from them by the arms and\r\n      authority of Rome. As long as the circulation was confined within\r\n      the bounds of the empire, it impressed the political machine with\r\n      a new degree of activity, and its consequences, sometimes\r\n      beneficial, could never become pernicious.\r\n\r\n      But it is no easy task to confine luxury within the limits of an\r\n      empire. The most remote countries of the ancient world were\r\n      ransacked to supply the pomp and delicacy of Rome. The forests of\r\n      Scythia afforded some valuable furs. Amber was brought over land\r\n      from the shores of the Baltic to the Danube; and the barbarians\r\n      were astonished at the price which they received in exchange for\r\n      so useless a commodity. 101 There was a considerable demand for\r\n      Babylonian carpets, and other manufactures of the East; but the\r\n      most important and unpopular branch of foreign trade was carried\r\n      on with Arabia and India. Every year, about the time of the\r\n      summer solstice, a fleet of a hundred and twenty vessels sailed\r\n      from Myos-hormos, a port of Egypt, on the Red Sea. By the\r\n      periodical assistance of the monsoons, they traversed the ocean\r\n      in about forty days. The coast of Malabar, or the island of\r\n      Ceylon, 102 was the usual term of their navigation, and it was in\r\n      those markets that the merchants from the more remote countries\r\n      of Asia expected their arrival. The return of the fleet of Egypt\r\n      was fixed to the months of December or January; and as soon as\r\n      their rich cargo had been transported on the backs of camels,\r\n      from the Red Sea to the Nile, and had descended that river as far\r\n      as Alexandria, it was poured, without delay, into the capital of\r\n      the empire. 103 The objects of oriental traffic were splendid and\r\n      trifling; silk, a pound of which was esteemed not inferior in\r\n      value to a pound of gold; 104 precious stones, among which the\r\n      pearl claimed the first rank after the diamond; 105 and a variety\r\n      of aromatics, that were consumed in religious worship and the\r\n      pomp of funerals. The labor and risk of the voyage was rewarded\r\n      with almost incredible profit; but the profit was made upon Roman\r\n      subjects, and a few individuals were enriched at the expense of\r\n      the public. As the natives of Arabia and India were contented\r\n      with the productions and manufactures of their own country,\r\n      silver, on the side of the Romans, was the principal, if not the\r\n      only 1051 instrument of commerce. It was a complaint worthy of\r\n      the gravity of the senate, that, in the purchase of female\r\n      ornaments, the wealth of the state was irrecoverably given away\r\n      to foreign and hostile nations. 106 The annual loss is computed,\r\n      by a writer of an inquisitive but censorious temper, at upwards\r\n      of eight hundred thousand pounds sterling. 107 Such was the style\r\n      of discontent, brooding over the dark prospect of approaching\r\n      poverty. And yet, if we compare the proportion between gold and\r\n      silver, as it stood in the time of Pliny, and as it was fixed in\r\n      the reign of Constantine, we shall discover within that period a\r\n      very considerable increase. 108 There is not the least reason to\r\n      suppose that gold was become more scarce; it is therefore evident\r\n      that silver was grown more common; that whatever might be the\r\n      amount of the Indian and Arabian exports, they were far from\r\n      exhausting the wealth of the Roman world; and that the produce of\r\n      the mines abundantly supplied the demands of commerce.\r\n\r\n      101 (return) [ Tacit.

The\r\n      most aspiring spirits resorted to the court or standard of the\r\n      emperors; and the deserted provinces, deprived of political\r\n      strength or union, insensibly sunk into the languid indifference\r\n      of private life.\r\n\r\n      The love of letters, almost inseparable from peace and\r\n      refinement, was fashionable among the subjects of Hadrian and the\r\n      Antonines, who were themselves men of learning and curiosity. It\r\n      was diffused over the whole extent of their empire; the most\r\n      northern tribes of Britons had acquired a taste for rhetoric;\r\n      Homer as well as Virgil were transcribed and studied on the banks\r\n      of the Rhine and Danube; and the most liberal rewards sought out\r\n      the faintest glimmerings of literary merit. 110 The sciences of\r\n      physic and astronomy were successfully cultivated by the Greeks;\r\n      the observations of Ptolemy and the writings of Galen are studied\r\n      by those who have improved their discoveries and corrected their\r\n      errors; but if we except the inimitable Lucian, this age of\r\n      indolence passed away without having produced a single writer of\r\n      original genius, or who excelled in the arts of elegant\r\n      composition.1101 The authority of Plato and Aristotle, of Zeno\r\n      and Epicurus, still reigned in the schools; and their systems,\r\n      transmitted with blind deference from one generation of disciples\r\n      to another, precluded every generous attempt to exercise the\r\n      powers, or enlarge the limits, of the human mind. The beauties of\r\n      the poets and orators, instead of kindling a fire like their own,\r\n      inspired only cold and servile imitations: or if any ventured to\r\n      deviate from those models, they deviated at the same time from\r\n      good sense and propriety. On the revival of letters, the youthful\r\n      vigor of the imagination, after a long repose, national\r\n      emulation, a new religion, new languages, and a new world, called\r\n      forth the genius of Europe. But the provincials of Rome, trained\r\n      by a uniform artificial foreign education, were engaged in a very\r\n      unequal competition with those bold ancients, who, by expressing\r\n      their genuine feelings in their native tongue, had already\r\n      occupied every place of honor. The name of Poet was almost\r\n      forgotten; that of Orator was usurped by the sophists. A cloud of\r\n      critics, of compilers, of commentators, darkened the face of\r\n      learning, and the decline of genius was soon followed by the\r\n      corruption of taste.\r\n\r\n      110 (return) [ Herodes Atticus gave the sophist Polemo above\r\n      eight thousand pounds for three declamations.

The salary of a philosopher was ten\r\n      thousand drachmæ, between three and four hundred pounds a year.\r\n      Similar establishments were formed in the other great cities of\r\n      the empire.

But,\r\n      unless public liberty is protected by intrepid and vigilant\r\n      guardians, the authority of so formidable a magistrate will soon\r\n      degenerate into despotism. The influence of the clergy, in an age\r\n      of superstition, might be usefully employed to assert the rights\r\n      of mankind; but so intimate is the connection between the throne\r\n      and the altar, that the banner of the church has very seldom been\r\n      seen on the side of the people. 101 A martial nobility and\r\n      stubborn commons, possessed of arms, tenacious of property, and\r\n      collected into constitutional assemblies, form the only balance\r\n      capable of preserving a free constitution against enterprises of\r\n      an aspiring prince.\r\n\r\n      101 (return) [ Often enough in the ages of superstition, but not\r\n      in the interest of the people or the state, but in that of the\r\n      church to which all others were subordinate.

After the victory of Actium, the\r\n      fate of the Roman world depended on the will of Octavianus,\r\n      surnamed Cæsar, by his uncle’s adoption, and afterwards Augustus,\r\n      by the flattery of the senate. The conqueror was at the head of\r\n      forty-four veteran legions, 1 conscious of their own strength,\r\n      and of the weakness of the constitution, habituated, during\r\n      twenty years’ civil war, to every act of blood and violence, and\r\n      passionately devoted to the house of Cæsar, from whence alone\r\n      they had received, and expected the most lavish rewards. The\r\n      provinces, long oppressed by the ministers of the republic,\r\n      sighed for the government of a single person, who would be the\r\n      master, not the accomplice, of those petty tyrants. The people of\r\n      Rome, viewing, with a secret pleasure, the humiliation of the\r\n      aristocracy, demanded only bread and public shows; and were\r\n      supplied with both by the liberal hand of Augustus. The rich and\r\n      polite Italians, who had almost universally embraced the\r\n      philosophy of Epicurus, enjoyed the present blessings of ease and\r\n      tranquillity, and suffered not the pleasing dream to be\r\n      interrupted by the memory of their old tumultuous freedom. With\r\n      its power, the senate had lost its dignity; many of the most\r\n      noble families were extinct. The republicans of spirit and\r\n      ability had perished in the field of battle, or in the\r\n      proscription. The door of the assembly had been designedly left\r\n      open, for a mixed multitude of more than a thousand persons, who\r\n      reflected disgrace upon their rank, instead of deriving honor\r\n      from it. 2\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ Orosius, vi. 18. * Note: Dion says twenty-five, (or\r\n      three,) (lv. 23.)

He was elected censor; and, in concert with his\r\n      faithful Agrippa, he examined the list of the senators, expelled\r\n      a few members, 201 whose vices or whose obstinacy required a\r\n      public example, persuaded near two hundred to prevent the shame\r\n      of an expulsion by a voluntary retreat, raised the qualification\r\n      of a senator to about ten thousand pounds, created a sufficient\r\n      number of patrician families, and accepted for himself the\r\n      honorable title of Prince of the Senate, 202 which had always\r\n      been bestowed, by the censors, on the citizen the most eminent\r\n      for his honors and services. 3 But whilst he thus restored the\r\n      dignity, he destroyed the independence, of the senate.

Filial piety had required at his hands the revenge of\r\n      his father’s murder; the humanity of his own nature had sometimes\r\n      given way to the stern laws of necessity, and to a forced\r\n      connection with two unworthy colleagues: as long as Antony lived,\r\n      the republic forbade him to abandon her to a degenerate Roman,\r\n      and a barbarian queen. He was now at liberty to satisfy his duty\r\n      and his inclination. He solemnly restored the senate and people\r\n      to all their ancient rights; and wished only to mingle with the\r\n      crowd of his fellow-citizens, and to share the blessings which he\r\n      had obtained for his country.” 4\r\n\r\n      4 (return) [ Dion (l. liii. p. 698) gives us a prolix and bombast\r\n      speech on this great occasion. I have borrowed from Suetonius and\r\n      Tacitus the general language of Augustus.]\r\n\r\n      It would require the pen of Tacitus (if Tacitus had assisted at\r\n      this assembly) to describe the various emotions of the senate,\r\n      those that were suppressed, and those that were affected. It was\r\n      dangerous to trust the sincerity of Augustus; to seem to distrust\r\n      it was still more dangerous. The respective advantages of\r\n      monarchy and a republic have often divided speculative inquirers;\r\n      the present greatness of the Roman state, the corruption of\r\n      manners, and the license of the soldiers, supplied new arguments\r\n      to the advocates of monarchy; and these general views of\r\n      government were again warped by the hopes and fears of each\r\n      individual. Amidst this confusion of sentiments, the answer of\r\n      the senate was unanimous and decisive. They refused to accept the\r\n      resignation of Augustus; they conjured him not to desert the\r\n      republic, which he had saved. After a decent resistance, the\r\n      crafty tyrant submitted to the orders of the senate; and\r\n      consented to receive the government of the provinces, and the\r\n      general command of the Roman armies, under the well-known names\r\n      of PROCONSUL and IMPERATOR. 5 But he would receive them only for\r\n      ten years. Even before the expiration of that period, he hope\r\n      that the wounds of civil discord would be completely healed, and\r\n      that the republic, restored to its pristine health and vigor,\r\n      would no longer require the dangerous interposition of so\r\n      extraordinary a magistrate. The memory of this comedy, repeated\r\n      several times during the life of Augustus, was preserved to the\r\n      last ages of the empire, by the peculiar pomp with which the\r\n      perpetual monarchs of Rome always solemnized the tenth years of\r\n      their reign. 6\r\n\r\n      5 (return) [ Imperator (from which we have derived Emperor)\r\n      signified under her republic no more than general, and was\r\n      emphatically bestowed by the soldiers, when on the field of\r\n      battle they proclaimed their victorious leader worthy of that\r\n      title. When the Roman emperors assumed it in that sense, they\r\n      placed it after their name, and marked how often they had taken\r\n      it.]\r\n\r\n      6 (return) [ Dion. l. liii. p. 703, &c.]\r\n\r\n      Without any violation of the principles of the constitution, the\r\n      general of the Roman armies might receive and exercise an\r\n      authority almost despotic over the soldiers, the enemies, and the\r\n      subjects of the republic. With regard to the soldiers, the\r\n      jealousy of freedom had, even from the earliest ages of Rome,\r\n      given way to the hopes of conquest, and a just sense of military\r\n      discipline. The dictator, or consul, had a right to command the\r\n      service of the Roman youth; and to punish an obstinate or\r\n      cowardly disobedience by the most severe and ignominious\r\n      penalties, by striking the offender out of the list of citizens,\r\n      by confiscating his property, and by selling his person into\r\n      slavery. 7 The most sacred rights of freedom, confirmed by the\r\n      Porcian and Sempronian laws, were suspended by the military\r\n      engagement. In his camp the general exercised an absolute power\r\n      of life and death; his jurisdiction was not confined by any forms\r\n      of trial, or rules of proceeding, and the execution of the\r\n      sentence was immediate and without appeal. 8 The choice of the\r\n      enemies of Rome was regularly decided by the legislative\r\n      authority. The most important resolutions of peace and war were\r\n      seriously debated in the senate, and solemnly ratified by the\r\n      people. But when the arms of the legions were carried to a great\r\n      distance from Italy, the general assumed the liberty of directing\r\n      them against whatever people, and in whatever manner, they judged\r\n      most advantageous for the public service. It was from the\r\n      success, not from the justice, of their enterprises, that they\r\n      expected the honors of a triumph. In the use of victory,\r\n      especially after they were no longer controlled by the\r\n      commissioners of the senate, they exercised the most unbounded\r\n      despotism. When Pompey commanded in the East, he rewarded his\r\n      soldiers and allies, dethroned princes, divided kingdoms, founded\r\n      colonies, and distributed the treasures of Mithridates. On his\r\n      return to Rome, he obtained, by a single act of the senate and\r\n      people, the universal ratification of all his proceedings. 9 Such\r\n      was the power over the soldiers, and over the enemies of Rome,\r\n      which was either granted to, or assumed by, the generals of the\r\n      republic. They were, at the same time, the governors, or rather\r\n      monarchs, of the conquered provinces, united the civil with the\r\n      military character, administered justice as well as the finances,\r\n      and exercised both the executive and legislative power of the\r\n      state.\r\n\r\n      7 (return) [ Livy Epitom. l. xiv.

They violated the laws of\r\n      nature and humanity, but they asserted those of military\r\n      discipline; and the people, who abhorred the action, was obliged\r\n      to respect the principle.]\r\n\r\n      9 (return) [ By the lavish but unconstrained suffrages of the\r\n      people, Pompey had obtained a military command scarcely inferior\r\n      to that of Augustus. Among the extraordinary acts of power\r\n      executed by the former we may remark the foundation of\r\n      twenty-nine cities, and the distribution of three or four\r\n      millions sterling to his troops. The ratification of his acts met\r\n      with some opposition and delays in the senate See Plutarch,\r\n      Appian, Dion Cassius, and the first book of the epistles to\r\n      Atticus.]\r\n\r\n      From what has already been observed in the first chapter of this\r\n      work, some notion may be formed of the armies and provinces thus\r\n      intrusted to the ruling hand of Augustus. But as it was\r\n      impossible that he could personally command the regions of so\r\n      many distant frontiers, he was indulged by the senate, as Pompey\r\n      had already been, in the permission of devolving the execution of\r\n      his great office on a sufficient number of lieutenants. In rank\r\n      and authority these officers seemed not inferior to the ancient\r\n      proconsuls; but their station was dependent and precarious. They\r\n      received and held their commissions at the will of a superior, to\r\n      whose auspicious influence the merit of their action was legally\r\n      attributed. 10 They were the representatives of the emperor. The\r\n      emperor alone was the general of the republic, and his\r\n      jurisdiction, civil as well as military, extended over all the\r\n      conquests of Rome. It was some satisfaction, however, to the\r\n      senate, that he always delegated his power to the members of\r\n      their body. The imperial lieutenants were of consular or\r\n      prætorian dignity; the legions were commanded by senators, and\r\n      the præfecture of Egypt was the only important trust committed to\r\n      a Roman knight.\r\n\r\n      10 (return) [ Under the commonwealth, a triumph could only be\r\n      claimed by the general, who was authorized to take the Auspices\r\n      in the name of the people. By an exact consequence, drawn from\r\n      this principle of policy and religion, the triumph was reserved\r\n      to the emperor; and his most successful lieutenants were\r\n      satisfied with some marks of distinction, which, under the name\r\n      of triumphal honors, were invented in their favor.]\r\n\r\n      Within six days after Augustus had been compelled to accept so\r\n      very liberal a grant, he resolved to gratify the pride of the\r\n      senate by an easy sacrifice. He represented to them, that they\r\n      had enlarged his powers, even beyond that degree which might be\r\n      required by the melancholy condition of the times. They had not\r\n      permitted him to refuse the laborious command of the armies and\r\n      the frontiers; but he must insist on being allowed to restore the\r\n      more peaceful and secure provinces to the mild administration of\r\n      the civil magistrate. In the division of the provinces, Augustus\r\n      provided for his own power and for the dignity of the republic.\r\n      The proconsuls of the senate, particularly those of Asia, Greece,\r\n      and Africa, enjoyed a more honorable character than the\r\n      lieutenants of the emperor, who commanded in Gaul or Syria. The\r\n      former were attended by lictors, the latter by soldiers. 105 A\r\n      law was passed, that wherever the emperor was present, his\r\n      extraordinary commission should supersede the ordinary\r\n      jurisdiction of the governor; a custom was introduced, that the\r\n      new conquests belonged to the imperial portion; and it was soon\r\n      discovered that the authority of the _Prince_, the favorite\r\n      epithet of Augustus, was the same in every part of the empire.\r\n\r\n      105 (return) [ This distinction is without foundation. The\r\n      lieutenants of the emperor, who were called Proprætors, whether\r\n      they had been prætors or consuls, were attended by six lictors;\r\n      those who had the right of the sword, (of life and death over the\r\n      soldiers.—M.) bore the military habit (paludamentum) and the\r\n      sword. The provincial governors commissioned by the senate, who,\r\n      whether they had been consuls or not, were called Pronconsuls,\r\n      had twelve lictors when they had been consuls, and six only when\r\n      they had but been prætors. The provinces of Africa and Asia were\r\n      only given to ex-consuls. See, on the Organization of the\r\n      Provinces, Dion, liii. 12, 16 Strabo, xvii 840.—W]\r\n\r\n      In return for this imaginary concession, Augustus obtained an\r\n      important privilege, which rendered him master of Rome and Italy.\r\n      By a dangerous exception to the ancient maxims, he was authorized\r\n      to preserve his military command, supported by a numerous body of\r\n      guards, even in time of peace, and in the heart of the capital.\r\n      His command, indeed, was confined to those citizens who were\r\n      engaged in the service by the military oath; but such was the\r\n      propensity of the Romans to servitude, that the oath was\r\n      voluntarily taken by the magistrates, the senators, and the\r\n      equestrian order, till the homage of flattery was insensibly\r\n      converted into an annual and solemn protestation of fidelity.\r\n\r\n      Although Augustus considered a military force as the firmest\r\n      foundation, he wisely rejected it, as a very odious instrument of\r\n      government. It was more agreeable to his temper, as well as to\r\n      his policy, to reign under the venerable names of ancient\r\n      magistracy, and artfully to collect, in his own person, all the\r\n      scattered rays of civil jurisdiction. With this view, he\r\n      permitted the senate to confer upon him, for his life, the powers\r\n      of the consular 11 and tribunitian offices, 12 which were, in the\r\n      same manner, continued to all his successors. The consuls had\r\n      succeeded to the kings of Rome, and represented the dignity of\r\n      the state. They superintended the ceremonies of religion, levied\r\n      and commanded the legions, gave audience to foreign ambassadors,\r\n      and presided in the assemblies both of the senate and people. The\r\n      general control of the finances was intrusted to their care; and\r\n      though they seldom had leisure to administer justice in person,\r\n      they were considered as the supreme guardians of law, equity, and\r\n      the public peace. Such was their ordinary jurisdiction; but\r\n      whenever the senate empowered the first magistrate to consult the\r\n      safety of the commonwealth, he was raised by that decree above\r\n      the laws, and exercised, in the defence of liberty, a temporary\r\n      despotism. 13 The character of the tribunes was, in every\r\n      respect, different from that of the consuls. The appearance of\r\n      the former was modest and humble; but their persons were sacred\r\n      and inviolable. Their force was suited rather for opposition than\r\n      for action. They were instituted to defend the oppressed, to\r\n      pardon offences, to arraign the enemies of the people, and, when\r\n      they judged it necessary, to stop, by a single word, the whole\r\n      machine of government. As long as the republic subsisted, the\r\n      dangerous influence, which either the consul or the tribune might\r\n      derive from their respective jurisdiction, was diminished by\r\n      several important restrictions. Their authority expired with the\r\n      year in which they were elected; the former office was divided\r\n      between two, the latter among ten persons; and, as both in their\r\n      private and public interest they were averse to each other, their\r\n      mutual conflicts contributed, for the most part, to strengthen\r\n      rather than to destroy the balance of the constitution. 131 But\r\n      when the consular and tribunitian powers were united, when they\r\n      were vested for life in a single person, when the general of the\r\n      army was, at the same time, the minister of the senate and the\r\n      representative of the Roman people, it was impossible to resist\r\n      the exercise, nor was it easy to define the limits, of his\r\n      imperial prerogative.\r\n\r\n      11 (return) [ Cicero (de Legibus, iii. 3) gives the consular\r\n      office the name of egia potestas; and Polybius (l. vi. c. 3)\r\n      observes three powers in the Roman constitution.

By the former he acquired the management of the\r\n      religion, and by the latter a legal inspection over the manners\r\n      and fortunes, of the Roman people. If so many distinct and\r\n      independent powers did not exactly unite with each other, the\r\n      complaisance of the senate was prepared to supply every\r\n      deficiency by the most ample and extraordinary concessions. The\r\n      emperors, as the first ministers of the republic, were exempted\r\n      from the obligation and penalty of many inconvenient laws: they\r\n      were authorized to convoke the senate, to make several motions in\r\n      the same day, to recommend candidates for the honors of the\r\n      state, to enlarge the bounds of the city, to employ the revenue\r\n      at their discretion, to declare peace and war, to ratify\r\n      treaties; and by a most comprehensive clause, they were empowered\r\n      to execute whatsoever they should judge advantageous to the\r\n      empire, and agreeable to the majesty of things private or public,\r\n      human of divine. 14\r\n\r\n      14 (return) [ See a fragment of a Decree of the Senate,\r\n      conferring on the emperor Vespasian all the powers granted to his\r\n      predecessors, Augustus, Tiberius, and Claudius.

The names and forms of the ancient\r\n      administration were preserved by Augustus with the most anxious\r\n      care. The usual number of consuls, prætors, and tribunes, 15 were\r\n      annually invested with their respective ensigns of office, and\r\n      continued to discharge some of their least important functions.\r\n      Those honors still attracted the vain ambition of the Romans; and\r\n      the emperors themselves, though invested for life with the powers\r\n      of the consulship, frequently aspired to the title of that annual\r\n      dignity, which they condescended to share with the most\r\n      illustrious of their fellow-citizens. 16 In the election of these\r\n      magistrates, the people, during the reign of Augustus, were\r\n      permitted to expose all the inconveniences of a wild democracy.\r\n      That artful prince, instead of discovering the least symptom of\r\n      impatience, humbly solicited their suffrages for himself or his\r\n      friends, and scrupulously practised all the duties of an ordinary\r\n      candidate. 17 But we may venture to ascribe to his councils the\r\n      first measure of the succeeding reign, by which the elections\r\n      were transferred to the senate. 18 The assemblies of the people\r\n      were forever abolished, and the emperors were delivered from a\r\n      dangerous multitude, who, without restoring liberty, might have\r\n      disturbed, and perhaps endangered, the established government.\r\n\r\n      15 (return) [ Two consuls were created on the Calends of January;\r\n      but in the course of the year others were substituted in their\r\n      places, till the annual number seems to have amounted to no less\r\n      than twelve.

Dion. lviii. 20.—W.]\r\n\r\n      By declaring themselves the protectors of the people, Marius and\r\n      Cæsar had subverted the constitution of their country. But as\r\n      soon as the senate had been humbled and disarmed, such an\r\n      assembly, consisting of five or six hundred persons, was found a\r\n      much more tractable and useful instrument of dominion. It was on\r\n      the dignity of the senate that Augustus and his successors\r\n      founded their new empire; and they affected, on every occasion,\r\n      to adopt the language and principles of Patricians. In the\r\n      administration of their own powers, they frequently consulted the\r\n      great national council, and _seemed_ to refer to its decision the\r\n      most important concerns of peace and war. Rome, Italy, and the\r\n      internal provinces, were subject to the immediate jurisdiction of\r\n      the senate. With regard to civil objects, it was the supreme\r\n      court of appeal; with regard to criminal matters, a tribunal,\r\n      constituted for the trial of all offences that were committed by\r\n      men in any public station, or that affected the peace and majesty\r\n      of the Roman people. The exercise of the judicial power became\r\n      the most frequent and serious occupation of the senate; and the\r\n      important causes that were pleaded before them afforded a last\r\n      refuge to the spirit of ancient eloquence. As a council of state,\r\n      and as a court of justice, the senate possessed very considerable\r\n      prerogatives; but in its legislative capacity, in which it was\r\n      supposed virtually to represent the people, the rights of\r\n      sovereignty were acknowledged to reside in that assembly. Every\r\n      power was derived from their authority, every law was ratified by\r\n      their sanction. Their regular meetings were held on three stated\r\n      days in every month, the Calends, the Nones, and the Ides. The\r\n      debates were conducted with decent freedom; and the emperors\r\n      themselves, who gloried in the name of senators, sat, voted, and\r\n      divided with their equals. To resume, in a few words, the system\r\n      of the Imperial government; as it was instituted by Augustus, and\r\n      maintained by those princes who understood their own interest and\r\n      that of the people, it may be defined an absolute monarchy\r\n      disguised by the forms of a commonwealth. The masters of the\r\n      Roman world surrounded their throne with darkness, concealed\r\n      their irresistible strength, and humbly professed themselves the\r\n      accountable ministers of the senate, whose supreme decrees they\r\n      dictated and obeyed. 19\r\n\r\n      19 (return) [Dion Cassius (l. liii. p. 703—714) has given a very\r\n      loose and partial sketch of the Imperial system. To illustrate\r\n      and often to correct him, I have meditated Tacitus, examined\r\n      Suetonius, and consulted the following moderns: the Abbé de la\r\n      Bleterie, in the Memoires de l’Academie des Inscriptions, tom.\r\n      xix. xxi. xxiv. xxv. xxvii.

Maffei, Verona Illustrata, p.\r\n      i. p. 245, &c.]\r\n\r\n      The face of the court corresponded with the forms of the\r\n      administration. The emperors, if we except those tyrants whose\r\n      capricious folly violated every law of nature and decency,\r\n      disdained that pomp and ceremony which might offend their\r\n      countrymen, but could add nothing to their real power. In all the\r\n      offices of life, they affected to confound themselves with their\r\n      subjects, and maintained with them an equal intercourse of visits\r\n      and entertainments. Their habit, their palace, their table, were\r\n      suited only to the rank of an opulent senator. Their family,\r\n      however numerous or splendid, was composed entirely of their\r\n      domestic slaves and freedmen. 20 Augustus or Trajan would have\r\n      blushed at employing the meanest of the Romans in those menial\r\n      offices, which, in the household and bedchamber of a limited\r\n      monarch, are so eagerly solicited by the proudest nobles of\r\n      Britain.\r\n\r\n      20 (return) [ A weak prince will always be governed by his\r\n      domestics. The power of slaves aggravated the shame of the\r\n      Romans; and the senate paid court to a Pallas or a Narcissus.\r\n      There is a chance that a modern favorite may be a gentleman.]\r\n\r\n      The deification of the emperors 21 is the only instance in which\r\n      they departed from their accustomed prudence and modesty. The\r\n      Asiatic Greeks were the first inventors, the successors of\r\n      Alexander the first objects, of this servile and impious mode of\r\n      adulation. 211 It was easily transferred from the kings to the\r\n      governors of Asia; and the Roman magistrates very frequently were\r\n      adored as provincial deities, with the pomp of altars and\r\n      temples, of festivals and sacrifices. 22 It was natural that the\r\n      emperors should not refuse what the proconsuls had accepted; and\r\n      the divine honors which both the one and the other received from\r\n      the provinces, attested rather the despotism than the servitude\r\n      of Rome. But the conquerors soon imitated the vanquished nations\r\n      in the arts of flattery; and the imperious spirit of the first\r\n      Cæsar too easily consented to assume, during his lifetime, a\r\n      place among the tutelar deities of Rome. The milder temper of his\r\n      successor declined so dangerous an ambition, which was never\r\n      afterwards revived, except by the madness of Caligula and\r\n      Domitian. Augustus permitted indeed some of the provincial cities\r\n      to erect temples to his honor, on condition that they should\r\n      associate the worship of Rome with that of the sovereign; he\r\n      tolerated private superstition, of which he might be the object;\r\n      23 but he contented himself with being revered by the senate and\r\n      the people in his human character, and wisely left to his\r\n      successor the care of his public deification. A regular custom\r\n      was introduced, that on the decease of every emperor who had\r\n      neither lived nor died like a tyrant, the senate by a solemn\r\n      decree should place him in the number of the gods: and the\r\n      ceremonies of his apotheosis were blended with those of his\r\n      funeral. 231 This legal, and, as it should seem, injudicious\r\n      profanation, so abhorrent to our stricter principles, was\r\n      received with a very faint murmur, 24 by the easy nature of\r\n      Polytheism; but it was received as an institution, not of\r\n      religion, but of policy. We should disgrace the virtues of the\r\n      Antonines by comparing them with the vices of Hercules or\r\n      Jupiter. Even the characters of Cæsar or Augustus were far\r\n      superior to those of the popular deities. But it was the\r\n      misfortune of the former to live in an enlightened age, and their\r\n      actions were too faithfully recorded to admit of such a mixture\r\n      of fable and mystery, as the devotion of the vulgar requires. As\r\n      soon as their divinity was established by law, it sunk into\r\n      oblivion, without contributing either to their own fame, or to\r\n      the dignity of succeeding princes.\r\n\r\n      21 (return) [ See a treatise of Vandale de Consecratione\r\n      Principium.

The successors of Alexander\r\n      were not the first deified sovereigns; the Egyptians had deified\r\n      and worshipped many of their kings; the Olympus of the Greeks was\r\n      peopled with divinities who had reigned on earth; finally,\r\n      Romulus himself had received the honors of an apotheosis (Tit.\r\n      Liv. i. 16) a long time before Alexander and his successors. It\r\n      is also an inaccuracy to confound the honors offered in the\r\n      provinces to the Roman governors, by temples and altars, with the\r\n      true apotheosis of the emperors; it was not a religious worship,\r\n      for it had neither priests nor sacrifices. Augustus was severely\r\n      blamed for having permitted himself to be worshipped as a god in\r\n      the provinces, (Tac. Ann. i. 10: ) he would not have incurred\r\n      that blame if he had only done what the governors were accustomed\r\n      to do.—G. from W. M.

The obscure name of\r\n      Octavianus he derived from a mean family, in the little town of\r\n      Aricia. 241 It was stained with the blood of the proscription;\r\n      and he was desirous, had it been possible, to erase all memory of\r\n      his former life. The illustrious surname of Cæsar he had assumed,\r\n      as the adopted son of the dictator: but he had too much good\r\n      sense, either to hope to be confounded, or to wish to be compared\r\n      with that extraordinary man. It was proposed in the senate to\r\n      dignify their minister with a new appellation; and after a\r\n      serious discussion, that of Augustus was chosen, among several\r\n      others, as being the most expressive of the character of peace\r\n      and sanctity, which he uniformly affected. 25 _Augustus_ was\r\n      therefore a personal, _Cæsar_ a family distinction. The former\r\n      should naturally have expired with the prince on whom it was\r\n      bestowed; and however the latter was diffused by adoption and\r\n      female alliance, Nero was the last prince who could allege any\r\n      hereditary claim to the honors of the Julian line. But, at the\r\n      time of his death, the practice of a century had inseparably\r\n      connected those appellations with the Imperial dignity, and they\r\n      have been preserved by a long succession of emperors, Romans,\r\n      Greeks, Franks, and Germans, from the fall of the republic to the\r\n      present time. A distinction was, however, soon introduced. The\r\n      sacred title of Augustus was always reserved for the monarch,\r\n      whilst the name of Cæsar was more freely communicated to his\r\n      relations; and, from the reign of Hadrian, at least, was\r\n      appropriated to the second person in the state, who was\r\n      considered as the presumptive heir of the empire. 251\r\n\r\n      241 (return) [ Octavius was not of an obscure family, but of a\r\n      considerable one of the equestrian order.

The time\r\n      at which it was employed in the latter sense, cannot be fixed\r\n      with certainty. Bach (Hist. Jurisprud.

Artzen) says that\r\n      Hadrian first received this title on his adoption; but as the\r\n      adoption of Hadrian is still doubtful, and besides this, as\r\n      Trajan, on his death-bed, was not likely to have created a new\r\n      title for his successor, it is more probable that Ælius Verus was\r\n      the first who was called Cæsar when adopted by Hadrian.

A cool\r\n      head, an unfeeling heart, and a cowardly disposition, prompted\r\n      him at the age of nineteen to assume the mask of hypocrisy, which\r\n      he never afterwards laid aside. With the same hand, and probably\r\n      with the same temper, he signed the proscription of Cicero, and\r\n      the pardon of Cinna. His virtues, and even his vices, were\r\n      artificial; and according to the various dictates of his\r\n      interest, he was at first the enemy, and at last the father, of\r\n      the Roman world. 26 When he framed the artful system of the\r\n      Imperial authority, his moderation was inspired by his fears. He\r\n      wished to deceive the people by an image of civil liberty, and\r\n      the armies by an image of civil government.\r\n\r\n      26 (return) [ As Octavianus advanced to the banquet of the\r\n      Cæsars, his color changed like that of the chameleon; pale at\r\n      first, then red, afterwards black, he at last assumed the mild\r\n      livery of Venus and the Graces, (Cæsars, p. 309.) This image,\r\n      employed by Julian in his ingenious fiction, is just and elegant;\r\n      but when he considers this change of character as real and\r\n      ascribes it to the power of philosophy, he does too much honor to\r\n      philosophy and to Octavianus.]\r\n\r\n      I. The death of Cæsar was ever before his eyes. He had lavished\r\n      wealth and honors on his adherents; but the most favored friends\r\n      of his uncle were in the number of the conspirators. The fidelity\r\n      of the legions might defend his authority against open rebellion;\r\n      but their vigilance could not secure his person from the dagger\r\n      of a determined republican; and the Romans, who revered the\r\n      memory of Brutus, 27 would applaud the imitation of his virtue.\r\n      Cæsar had provoked his fate, as much as by the ostentation of his\r\n      power, as by his power itself. The consul or the tribune might\r\n      have reigned in peace. The title of king had armed the Romans\r\n      against his life. Augustus was sensible that mankind is governed\r\n      by names; nor was he deceived in his expectation, that the senate\r\n      and people would submit to slavery, provided they were\r\n      respectfully assured that they still enjoyed their ancient\r\n      freedom. A feeble senate and enervated people cheerfully\r\n      acquiesced in the pleasing illusion, as long as it was supported\r\n      by the virtue, or even by the prudence, of the successors of\r\n      Augustus. It was a motive of self-preservation, not a principle\r\n      of liberty, that animated the conspirators against Caligula,\r\n      Nero, and Domitian. They attacked the person of the tyrant,\r\n      without aiming their blow at the authority of the emperor.\r\n\r\n      27 (return) [ Two centuries after the establishment of monarchy,\r\n      the emperor Marcus Antoninus recommends the character of Brutus\r\n      as a perfect model of Roman virtue. * Note: In a very ingenious\r\n      essay, Gibbon has ventured to call in question the preeminent\r\n      virtue of Brutus. Misc Works, iv. 95.—M.]\r\n\r\n      There appears, indeed, _one_ memorable occasion, in which the\r\n      senate, after seventy years of patience, made an ineffectual\r\n      attempt to re-assume its long-forgotten rights. When the throne\r\n      was vacant by the murder of Caligula, the consuls convoked that\r\n      assembly in the Capitol, condemned the memory of the Cæsars, gave\r\n      the watchword _liberty_ to the few cohorts who faintly adhered to\r\n      their standard, and during eight-and-forty hours acted as the\r\n      independent chiefs of a free commonwealth. But while they\r\n      deliberated, the prætorian guards had resolved. The stupid\r\n      Claudius, brother of Germanicus, was already in their camp,\r\n      invested with the Imperial purple, and prepared to support his\r\n      election by arms. The dream of liberty was at an end; and the\r\n      senate awoke to all the horrors of inevitable servitude. Deserted\r\n      by the people, and threatened by a military force, that feeble\r\n      assembly was compelled to ratify the choice of the prætorians,\r\n      and to embrace the benefit of an amnesty, which Claudius had the\r\n      prudence to offer, and the generosity to observe. 28\r\n\r\n      28 (return) [ It is much to be regretted that we have lost the\r\n      part of Tacitus which treated of that transaction. We are forced\r\n      to content ourselves with the popular rumors of Josephus, and the\r\n      imperfect hints of Dion and Suetonius.]\r\n\r\n      II. The insolence of the armies inspired Augustus with fears of a\r\n      still more alarming nature. The despair of the citizens could\r\n      only attempt, what the power of the soldiers was, at any time,\r\n      able to execute. How precarious was his own authority over men\r\n      whom he had taught to violate every social duty! He had heard\r\n      their seditious clamors; he dreaded their calmer moments of\r\n      reflection. One revolution had been purchased by immense rewards;\r\n      but a second revolution might double those rewards. The troops\r\n      professed the fondest attachment to the house of Cæsar; but the\r\n      attachments of the multitude are capricious and inconstant.\r\n      Augustus summoned to his aid whatever remained in those fierce\r\n      minds of Roman prejudices; enforced the rigor of discipline by\r\n      the sanction of law; and, interposing the majesty of the senate\r\n      between the emperor and the army, boldly claimed their\r\n      allegiance, as the first magistrate of the republic.\r\n\r\n      During a long period of two hundred and twenty years from the\r\n      establishment of this artful system to the death of Commodus, the\r\n      dangers inherent to a military government were, in a great\r\n      measure, suspended. The soldiers were seldom roused to that fatal\r\n      sense of their own strength, and of the weakness of the civil\r\n      authority, which was, before and afterwards, productive of such\r\n      dreadful calamities. Caligula and Domitian were assassinated in\r\n      their palace by their own domestics: 281 the convulsions which\r\n      agitated Rome on the death of the former, were confined to the\r\n      walls of the city. But Nero involved the whole empire in his\r\n      ruin. In the space of eighteen months, four princes perished by\r\n      the sword; and the Roman world was shaken by the fury of the\r\n      contending armies. Excepting only this short, though violent\r\n      eruption of military license, the two centuries from Augustus 29\r\n      to Commodus passed away unstained with civil blood, and\r\n      undisturbed by revolutions. The emperor was elected by _the\r\n      authority of the senate_, and _the consent of the soldiers_. 30\r\n      The legions respected their oath of fidelity; and it requires a\r\n      minute inspection of the Roman annals to discover three\r\n      inconsiderable rebellions, which were all suppressed in a few\r\n      months, and without even the hazard of a battle. 31\r\n\r\n      281 (return) [ Caligula perished by a conspiracy formed by the\r\n      officers of the prætorian troops, and Domitian would not,\r\n      perhaps, have been assassinated without the participation of the\r\n      two chiefs of that guard in his death.—W.]\r\n\r\n      29 (return) [ Augustus restored the ancient severity of\r\n      discipline. After the civil wars, he dropped the endearing name\r\n      of Fellow-Soldiers, and called them only Soldiers, (Sueton. in\r\n      August. c. 25.) See the use Tiberius made of the Senate in the\r\n      mutiny of the Pannonian legions, (Tacit. Annal. i.)]\r\n\r\n      30 (return) [ These words seem to have been the constitutional\r\n      language. See Tacit. Annal. xiii. 4. * Note: This panegyric on\r\n      the soldiery is rather too liberal. Claudius was obliged to\r\n      purchase their consent to his coronation: the presents which he\r\n      made, and those which the prætorians received on other occasions,\r\n      considerably embarrassed the finances. Moreover, this formidable\r\n      guard favored, in general, the cruelties of the tyrants. The\r\n      distant revolts were more frequent than Gibbon thinks: already,\r\n      under Tiberius, the legions of Germany would have seditiously\r\n      constrained Germanicus to assume the Imperial purple. On the\r\n      revolt of Claudius Civilis, under Vespasian, the legions of Gaul\r\n      murdered their general, and offered their assistance to the Gauls\r\n      who were in insurrection. Julius Sabinus made himself be\r\n      proclaimed emperor, &c. The wars, the merit, and the severe\r\n      discipline of Trajan, Hadrian, and the two Antonines,\r\n      established, for some time, a greater degree of subordination.—W]\r\n\r\n      31 (return) [ The first was Camillus Scribonianus, who took up\r\n      arms in Dalmatia against Claudius, and was deserted by his own\r\n      troops in five days, the second, L. Antonius, in Germany, who\r\n      rebelled against Domitian; and the third, Avidius Cassius, in the\r\n      reign of M. Antoninus. The two last reigned but a few months, and\r\n      were cut off by their own adherents. We may observe, that both\r\n      Camillus and Cassius colored their ambition with the design of\r\n      restoring the republic; a task, said Cassius peculiarly reserved\r\n      for his name and family.]\r\n\r\n      In elective monarchies, the vacancy of the throne is a moment big\r\n      with danger and mischief. The Roman emperors, desirous to spare\r\n      the legions that interval of suspense, and the temptation of an\r\n      irregular choice, invested their designed successor with so large\r\n      a share of present power, as should enable him, after their\r\n      decease, to assume the remainder, without suffering the empire to\r\n      perceive the change of masters. Thus Augustus, after all his\r\n      fairer prospects had been snatched from him by untimely deaths,\r\n      rested his last hopes on Tiberius, obtained for his adopted son\r\n      the censorial and tribunitian powers, and dictated a law, by\r\n      which the future prince was invested with an authority equal to\r\n      his own, over the provinces and the armies. 32 Thus Vespasian\r\n      subdued the generous mind of his eldest son. Titus was adored by\r\n      the eastern legions, which, under his command, had recently\r\n      achieved the conquest of Judæa. His power was dreaded, and, as\r\n      his virtues were clouded by the intemperance of youth, his\r\n      designs were suspected. Instead of listening to such unworthy\r\n      suspicions, the prudent monarch associated Titus to the full\r\n      powers of the Imperial dignity; and the grateful son ever\r\n      approved himself the humble and faithful minister of so indulgent\r\n      a father. 33\r\n\r\n      32 (return) [ Velleius Paterculus, l. ii. c. 121.

Hist.\r\n      Natur.]\r\n\r\n      The good sense of Vespasian engaged him indeed to embrace every\r\n      measure that might confirm his recent and precarious elevation.\r\n      The military oath, and the fidelity of the troops, had been\r\n      consecrated, by the habits of a hundred years, to the name and\r\n      family of the Cæsars; and although that family had been continued\r\n      only by the fictitious rite of adoption, the Romans still\r\n      revered, in the person of Nero, the grandson of Germanicus, and\r\n      the lineal successor of Augustus. It was not without reluctance\r\n      and remorse, that the prætorian guards had been persuaded to\r\n      abandon the cause of the tyrant. 34 The rapid downfall of Galba,\r\n      Otho, and Vitellus, taught the armies to consider the emperors as\r\n      the creatures of _their_ will, and the instruments of _their_\r\n      license. The birth of Vespasian was mean: his grandfather had\r\n      been a private soldier, his father a petty officer of the\r\n      revenue; 35 his own merit had raised him, in an advanced age, to\r\n      the empire; but his merit was rather useful than shining, and his\r\n      virtues were disgraced by a strict and even sordid parsimony.\r\n      Such a prince consulted his true interest by the association of a\r\n      son, whose more splendid and amiable character might turn the\r\n      public attention from the obscure origin, to the future glories,\r\n      of the Flavian house. Under the mild administration of Titus, the\r\n      Roman world enjoyed a transient felicity, and his beloved memory\r\n      served to protect, above fifteen years, the vices of his brother\r\n      Domitian.\r\n\r\n      34 (return) [ This idea is frequently and strongly inculcated by\r\n      Tacitus. See Hist. i. 5, 16, ii. 76.]\r\n\r\n      35 (return) [ The emperor Vespasian, with his usual good sense,\r\n      laughed at the genealogists, who deduced his family from Flavius,\r\n      the founder of Reate, (his native country,) and one of the\r\n      companions of Hercules Suet in Vespasian, c. 12.]\r\n\r\n      Nerva had scarcely accepted the purple from the assassins of\r\n      Domitian, before he discovered that his feeble age was unable to\r\n      stem the torrent of public disorders, which had multiplied under\r\n      the long tyranny of his predecessor. His mild disposition was\r\n      respected by the good; but the degenerate Romans required a more\r\n      vigorous character, whose justice should strike terror into the\r\n      guilty. Though he had several relations, he fixed his choice on a\r\n      stranger. He adopted Trajan, then about forty years of age, and\r\n      who commanded a powerful army in the Lower Germany; and\r\n      immediately, by a decree of the senate, declared him his\r\n      colleague and successor in the empire. 36 It is sincerely to be\r\n      lamented, that whilst we are fatigued with the disgustful\r\n      relation of Nero’s crimes and follies, we are reduced to collect\r\n      the actions of Trajan from the glimmerings of an abridgment, or\r\n      the doubtful light of a panegyric. There remains, however, one\r\n      panegyric far removed beyond the suspicion of flattery. Above two\r\n      hundred and fifty years after the death of Trajan, the senate, in\r\n      pouring out the customary acclamations on the accession of a new\r\n      emperor, wished that he might surpass the felicity of Augustus,\r\n      and the virtue of Trajan. 37\r\n\r\n      36 (return) [ Dion, l. lxviii. p. 1121. Plin. Secund. in\r\n      Panegyric.]\r\n\r\n      37 (return) [ Felicior Augusto, Melior Trajano. Eutrop. viii. 5.]\r\n\r\n      We may readily believe, that the father of his country hesitated\r\n      whether he ought to intrust the various and doubtful character of\r\n      his kinsman Hadrian with sovereign power. In his last moments the\r\n      arts of the empress Plotina either fixed the irresolution of\r\n      Trajan, or boldly supposed a fictitious adoption; 38 the truth of\r\n      which could not be safely disputed, and Hadrian was peaceably\r\n      acknowledged as his lawful successor. Under his reign, as has\r\n      been already mentioned, the empire flourished in peace and\r\n      prosperity. He encouraged the arts, reformed the laws, asserted\r\n      military discipline, and visited all his provinces in person. His\r\n      vast and active genius was equally suited to the most enlarged\r\n      views, and the minute details of civil policy. But the ruling\r\n      passions of his soul were curiosity and vanity. As they\r\n      prevailed, and as they were attracted by different objects,\r\n      Hadrian was, by turns, an excellent prince, a ridiculous sophist,\r\n      and a jealous tyrant. The general tenor of his conduct deserved\r\n      praise for its equity and moderation. Yet in the first days of\r\n      his reign, he put to death four consular senators, his personal\r\n      enemies, and men who had been judged worthy of empire; and the\r\n      tediousness of a painful illness rendered him, at last, peevish\r\n      and cruel. The senate doubted whether they should pronounce him a\r\n      god or a tyrant; and the honors decreed to his memory were\r\n      granted to the prayers of the pious Antoninus. 39\r\n\r\n      38 (return) [ Dion (l. lxix. p. 1249) affirms the whole to have\r\n      been a fiction, on the authority of his father, who, being\r\n      governor of the province where Trajan died, had very good\r\n      opportunities of sifting this mysterious transaction. Yet Dodwell\r\n      (Prælect. Camden. xvii.) has maintained that Hadrian was called\r\n      to the certain hope of the empire, during the lifetime of\r\n      Trajan.]\r\n\r\n      39 (return) [ Dion, (l. lxx. p. 1171.) Aurel. Victor.]\r\n\r\n      The caprice of Hadrian influenced his choice of a successor.\r\n\r\n      After revolving in his mind several men of distinguished merit,\r\n      whom he esteemed and hated, he adopted Ælius Verus a gay and\r\n      voluptuous nobleman, recommended by uncommon beauty to the lover\r\n      of Antinous. 40 But whilst Hadrian was delighting himself with\r\n      his own applause, and the acclamations of the soldiers, whose\r\n      consent had been secured by an immense donative, the new Cæsar 41\r\n      was ravished from his embraces by an untimely death. He left only\r\n      one son. Hadrian commended the boy to the gratitude of the\r\n      Antonines. He was adopted by Pius; and, on the accession of\r\n      Marcus, was invested with an equal share of sovereign power.\r\n      Among the many vices of this younger Verus, he possessed one\r\n      virtue; a dutiful reverence for his wiser colleague, to whom he\r\n      willingly abandoned the ruder cares of empire. The philosophic\r\n      emperor dissembled his follies, lamented his early death, and\r\n      cast a decent veil over his memory.\r\n\r\n      40 (return) [ The deification of Antinous, his medals, his\r\n      statues, temples, city, oracles, and constellation, are well\r\n      known, and still dishonor the memory of Hadrian.

Aurelius Victor in Epitom.]\r\n\r\n      As soon as Hadrian’s passion was either gratified or\r\n      disappointed, he resolved to deserve the thanks of posterity, by\r\n      placing the most exalted merit on the Roman throne. His\r\n      discerning eye easily discovered a senator about fifty years of\r\n      age, blameless in all the offices of life; and a youth of about\r\n      seventeen, whose riper years opened a fair prospect of every\r\n      virtue: the elder of these was declared the son and successor of\r\n      Hadrian, on condition, however, that he himself should\r\n      immediately adopt the younger. The two Antonines (for it is of\r\n      them that we are now speaking,) governed the Roman world\r\n      forty-two years, with the same invariable spirit of wisdom and\r\n      virtue. Although Pius had two sons, 42 he preferred the welfare\r\n      of Rome to the interest of his family, gave his daughter\r\n      Faustina, in marriage to young Marcus, obtained from the senate\r\n      the tribunitian and proconsular powers, and, with a noble\r\n      disdain, or rather ignorance of jealousy, associated him to all\r\n      the labors of government. Marcus, on the other hand, revered the\r\n      character of his benefactor, loved him as a parent, obeyed him as\r\n      his sovereign, 43 and, after he was no more, regulated his own\r\n      administration by the example and maxims of his predecessor.\r\n      Their united reigns are possibly the only period of history in\r\n      which the happiness of a great people was the sole object of\r\n      government.\r\n\r\n      42 (return) [ Without the help of medals and inscriptions, we\r\n      should be ignorant of this fact, so honorable to the memory of\r\n      Pius.

At the age of twelve years he embraced the\r\n      rigid system of the Stoics, which taught him to submit his body\r\n      to his mind, his passions to his reason; to consider virtue as\r\n      the only good, vice as the only evil, all things external as\r\n      things indifferent. 46 His meditations, composed in the tumult of\r\n      the camp, are still extant; and he even condescended to give\r\n      lessons of philosophy, in a more public manner than was perhaps\r\n      consistent with the modesty of sage, or the dignity of an\r\n      emperor. 47 But his life was the noblest commentary on the\r\n      precepts of Zeno. He was severe to himself, indulgent to the\r\n      imperfections of others, just and beneficent to all mankind. He\r\n      regretted that Avidius Cassius, who excited a rebellion in Syria,\r\n      had disappointed him, by a voluntary death, 471 of the pleasure\r\n      of converting an enemy into a friend;; and he justified the\r\n      sincerity of that sentiment, by moderating the zeal of the senate\r\n      against the adherents of the traitor. 48 War he detested, as the\r\n      disgrace and calamity of human nature; 481 but when the necessity\r\n      of a just defence called upon him to take up arms, he readily\r\n      exposed his person to eight winter campaigns, on the frozen banks\r\n      of the Danube, the severity of which was at last fatal to the\r\n      weakness of his constitution. His memory was revered by a\r\n      grateful posterity, and above a century after his death, many\r\n      persons preserved the image of Marcus Antoninus among those of\r\n      their household gods. 49\r\n\r\n      45 (return) [ The enemies of Marcus charged him with hypocrisy,\r\n      and with a want of that simplicity which distinguished Pius and\r\n      even Verus.

Antonin. c. 18.]\r\n\r\n      If a man were called to fix the period in the history of the\r\n      world, during which the condition of the human race was most\r\n      happy and prosperous, he would, without hesitation, name that\r\n      which elapsed from the death of Domitian to the accession of\r\n      Commodus. The vast extent of the Roman empire was governed by\r\n      absolute power, under the guidance of virtue and wisdom. The\r\n      armies were restrained by the firm but gentle hand of four\r\n      successive emperors, whose characters and authority commanded\r\n      involuntary respect. The forms of the civil administration were\r\n      carefully preserved by Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the Antonines,\r\n      who delighted in the image of liberty, and were pleased with\r\n      considering themselves as the accountable ministers of the laws.\r\n      Such princes deserved the honor of restoring the republic, had\r\n      the Romans of their days been capable of enjoying a rational\r\n      freedom.\r\n\r\n      The labors of these monarchs were overpaid by the immense reward\r\n      that inseparably waited on their success; by the honest pride of\r\n      virtue, and by the exquisite delight of beholding the general\r\n      happiness of which they were the authors. A just but melancholy\r\n      reflection imbittered, however, the noblest of human enjoyments.\r\n      They must often have recollected the instability of a happiness\r\n      which depended on the character of single man. The fatal moment\r\n      was perhaps approaching, when some licentious youth, or some\r\n      jealous tyrant, would abuse, to the destruction, that absolute\r\n      power, which they had exerted for the benefit of their people.\r\n      The ideal restraints of the senate and the laws might serve to\r\n      display the virtues, but could never correct the vices, of the\r\n      emperor. The military force was a blind and irresistible\r\n      instrument of oppression; and the corruption of Roman manners\r\n      would always supply flatterers eager to applaud, and ministers\r\n      prepared to serve, the fear or the avarice, the lust or the\r\n      cruelty, of their master. These gloomy apprehensions had been\r\n      already justified by the experience of the Romans. The annals of\r\n      the emperors exhibit a strong and various picture of human\r\n      nature, which we should vainly seek among the mixed and doubtful\r\n      characters of modern history. In the conduct of those monarchs we\r\n      may trace the utmost lines of vice and virtue; the most exalted\r\n      perfection, and the meanest degeneracy of our own species. The\r\n      golden age of Trajan and the Antonines had been preceded by an\r\n      age of iron. It is almost superfluous to enumerate the unworthy\r\n      successors of Augustus. Their unparalleled vices, and the\r\n      splendid theatre on which they were acted, have saved them from\r\n      oblivion. The dark, unrelenting Tiberius, the furious Caligula,\r\n      the feeble Claudius, the profligate and cruel Nero, the beastly\r\n      Vitellius, 50 and the timid, inhuman Domitian, are condemned to\r\n      everlasting infamy. During fourscore years (excepting only the\r\n      short and doubtful respite of Vespasian’s reign) 51 Rome groaned\r\n      beneath an unremitting tyranny, which exterminated the ancient\r\n      families of the republic, and was fatal to almost every virtue\r\n      and every talent that arose in that unhappy period.\r\n\r\n      50 (return) [ Vitellius consumed in mere eating at least six\r\n      millions of our money in about seven months. It is not easy to\r\n      express his vices with dignity, or even decency.

From these\r\n      causes were derived, 1. The exquisite sensibility of the\r\n      sufferers; and, 2. The impossibility of escaping from the hand of\r\n      the oppressor.\r\n\r\n      I. When Persia was governed by the descendants of Sefi, a race of\r\n      princes whose wanton cruelty often stained their divan, their\r\n      table, and their bed, with the blood of their favorites, there is\r\n      a saying recorded of a young nobleman, that he never departed\r\n      from the sultan’s presence, without satisfying himself whether\r\n      his head was still on his shoulders. The experience of every day\r\n      might almost justify the scepticism of Rustan. 52 Yet the fatal\r\n      sword, suspended above him by a single thread, seems not to have\r\n      disturbed the slumbers, or interrupted the tranquillity, of the\r\n      Persian. The monarch’s frown, he well knew, could level him with\r\n      the dust; but the stroke of lightning or apoplexy might be\r\n      equally fatal; and it was the part of a wise man to forget the\r\n      inevitable calamities of human life in the enjoyment of the\r\n      fleeting hour. He was dignified with the appellation of the\r\n      king’s slave; had, perhaps, been purchased from obscure parents,\r\n      in a country which he had never known; and was trained up from\r\n      his infancy in the severe discipline of the seraglio. 53 His\r\n      name, his wealth, his honors, were the gift of a master, who\r\n      might, without injustice, resume what he had bestowed. Rustan’s\r\n      knowledge, if he possessed any, could only serve to confirm his\r\n      habits by prejudices. His language afforded not words for any\r\n      form of government, except absolute monarchy. The history of the\r\n      East informed him, that such had ever been the condition of\r\n      mankind. 54 The Koran, and the interpreters of that divine book,\r\n      inculcated to him, that the sultan was the descendant of the\r\n      prophet, and the vicegerent of heaven; that patience was the\r\n      first virtue of a Mussulman, and unlimited obedience the great\r\n      duty of a subject.\r\n\r\n      52 (return) [ Voyage de Chardin en Perse, vol. iii. p. 293.]\r\n\r\n      53 (return) [ The practice of raising slaves to the great offices\r\n      of state is still more common among the Turks than among the\r\n      Persians.

They have done them a very ill\r\n      office.]\r\n\r\n      The minds of the Romans were very differently prepared for\r\n      slavery. Oppressed beneath the weight of their own corruption and\r\n      of military violence, they for a long while preserved the\r\n      sentiments, or at least the ideas, of their free-born ancestors.\r\n      The education of Helvidius and Thrasea, of Tacitus and Pliny, was\r\n      the same as that of Cato and Cicero. From Grecian philosophy,\r\n      they had imbibed the justest and most liberal notions of the\r\n      dignity of human nature, and the origin of civil society. The\r\n      history of their own country had taught them to revere a free, a\r\n      virtuous, and a victorious commonwealth; to abhor the successful\r\n      crimes of Cæsar and Augustus; and inwardly to despise those\r\n      tyrants whom they adored with the most abject flattery. As\r\n      magistrates and senators they were admitted into the great\r\n      council, which had once dictated laws to the earth, whose\r\n      authority was so often prostituted to the vilest purposes of\r\n      tyranny. Tiberius, and those emperors who adopted his maxims,\r\n      attempted to disguise their murders by the formalities of\r\n      justice, and perhaps enjoyed a secret pleasure in rendering the\r\n      senate their accomplice as well as their victim. By this\r\n      assembly, the last of the Romans were condemned for imaginary\r\n      crimes and real virtues. Their infamous accusers assumed the\r\n      language of independent patriots, who arraigned a dangerous\r\n      citizen before the tribunal of his country; and the public\r\n      service was rewarded by riches and honors. 55 The servile judges\r\n      professed to assert the majesty of the commonwealth, violated in\r\n      the person of its first magistrate, 56 whose clemency they most\r\n      applauded when they trembled the most at his inexorable and\r\n      impending cruelty. 57 The tyrant beheld their baseness with just\r\n      contempt, and encountered their secret sentiments of detestation\r\n      with sincere and avowed hatred for the whole body of the senate.\r\n\r\n      55 (return) [ They alleged the example of Scipio and Cato,\r\n      (Tacit.

The division of Europe into a number of independent states,\r\n      connected, however, with each other by the general resemblance of\r\n      religion, language, and manners, is productive of the most\r\n      beneficial consequences to the liberty of mankind. A modern\r\n      tyrant, who should find no resistance either in his own breast,\r\n      or in his people, would soon experience a gentle restraint from\r\n      the example of his equals, the dread of present censure, the\r\n      advice of his allies, and the apprehension of his enemies. The\r\n      object of his displeasure, escaping from the narrow limits of his\r\n      dominions, would easily obtain, in a happier climate, a secure\r\n      refuge, a new fortune adequate to his merit, the freedom of\r\n      complaint, and perhaps the means of revenge. But the empire of\r\n      the Romans filled the world, and when the empire fell into the\r\n      hands of a single person, the world became a safe and dreary\r\n      prison for his enemies. The slave of Imperial despotism, whether\r\n      he was condemned to drag his gilded chain in rome and the senate,\r\n      or to were out a life of exile on the barren rock of Seriphus, or\r\n      the frozen bank of the Danube, expected his fate in silent\r\n      despair. 58 To resist was fatal, and it was impossible to fly. On\r\n      every side he was encompassed with a vast extent of sea and land,\r\n      which he could never hope to traverse without being discovered,\r\n      seized, and restored to his irritated master. Beyond the\r\n      frontiers, his anxious view could discover nothing, except the\r\n      ocean, inhospitable deserts, hostile tribes of barbarians, of\r\n      fierce manners and unknown language, or dependent kings, who\r\n      would gladly purchase the emperor’s protection by the sacrifice\r\n      of an obnoxious fugitive. 59 “Wherever you are,” said Cicero to\r\n      the exiled Marcellus, “remember that you are equally within the\r\n      power of the conqueror.” 60\r\n\r\n      58 (return) [ Seriphus was a small rocky island in the Ægean Sea,\r\n      the inhabitants of which were despised for their ignorance and\r\n      obscurity.

It has been objected to Marcus, that he\r\n      sacrificed the happiness of millions to a fond partiality for a\r\n      worthless boy; and that he chose a successor in his own family,\r\n      rather than in the republic. Nothing however, was neglected by\r\n      the anxious father, and by the men of virtue and learning whom he\r\n      summoned to his assistance, to expand the narrow mind of young\r\n      Commodus, to correct his growing vices, and to render him worthy\r\n      of the throne for which he was designed. But the power of\r\n      instruction is seldom of much efficacy, except in those happy\r\n      dispositions where it is almost superfluous. The distasteful\r\n      lesson of a grave philosopher was, in a moment, obliterated by\r\n      the whisper of a profligate favorite; and Marcus himself blasted\r\n      the fruits of this labored education, by admitting his son, at\r\n      the age of fourteen or fifteen, to a full participation of the\r\n      Imperial power. He lived but four years afterwards: but he lived\r\n      long enough to repent a rash measure, which raised the impetuous\r\n      youth above the restraint of reason and authority.\r\n\r\n      Most of the crimes which disturb the internal peace of society,\r\n      are produced by the restraints which the necessary but unequal\r\n      laws of property have imposed on the appetites of mankind, by\r\n      confining to a few the possession of those objects that are\r\n      coveted by many. Of all our passions and appetites, the love of\r\n      power is of the most imperious and unsociable nature, since the\r\n      pride of one man requires the submission of the multitude. In the\r\n      tumult of civil discord, the laws of society lose their force,\r\n      and their place is seldom supplied by those of humanity. The\r\n      ardor of contention, the pride of victory, the despair of\r\n      success, the memory of past injuries, and the fear of future\r\n      dangers, all contribute to inflame the mind, and to silence the\r\n      voice of pity. From such motives almost every page of history has\r\n      been stained with civil blood; but these motives will not account\r\n      for the unprovoked cruelties of Commodus, who had nothing to wish\r\n      and every thing to enjoy. The beloved son of Marcus succeeded to\r\n      his father, amidst the acclamations of the senate and armies; 6\r\n      and when he ascended the throne, the happy youth saw round him\r\n      neither competitor to remove, nor enemies to punish. In this\r\n      calm, elevated station, it was surely natural that he should\r\n      prefer the love of mankind to their detestation, the mild glories\r\n      of his five predecessors to the ignominious fate of Nero and\r\n      Domitian.\r\n\r\n      6 (return) [ Commodus was the first _Porphyrogenitus_, (born\r\n      since his father’s accession to the throne.)

Tillemont, Hist.\r\n      des Empereurs, tom. ii. p. 752.]\r\n\r\n      Yet Commodus was not, as he has been represented, a tiger born\r\n      with an insatiate thirst of human blood, and capable, from his\r\n      infancy, of the most inhuman actions. 7 Nature had formed him of\r\n      a weak rather than a wicked disposition. His simplicity and\r\n      timidity rendered him the slave of his attendants, who gradually\r\n      corrupted his mind. His cruelty, which at first obeyed the\r\n      dictates of others, degenerated into habit, and at length became\r\n      the ruling passion of his soul. 8\r\n\r\n      7 (return) [ Hist.

They exaggerated the\r\n      hardships and dangers of a campaign in the wild countries beyond\r\n      the Danube; and they assured the indolent prince that the terror\r\n      of his name, and the arms of his lieutenants, would be sufficient\r\n      to complete the conquest of the dismayed barbarians, or to impose\r\n      such conditions as were more advantageous than any conquest. By a\r\n      dexterous application to his sensual appetites, they compared the\r\n      tranquillity, the splendor, the refined pleasures of Rome, with\r\n      the tumult of a Pannonian camp, which afforded neither leisure\r\n      nor materials for luxury. 10 Commodus listened to the pleasing\r\n      advice; but whilst he hesitated between his own inclination and\r\n      the awe which he still retained for his father’s counsellors, the\r\n      summer insensibly elapsed, and his triumphal entry into the\r\n      capital was deferred till the autumn. His graceful person, 11\r\n      popular address, and imagined virtues, attracted the public\r\n      favor; the honorable peace which he had recently granted to the\r\n      barbarians, diffused a universal joy; 12 his impatience to\r\n      revisit Rome was fondly ascribed to the love of his country; and\r\n      his dissolute course of amusements was faintly condemned in a\r\n      prince of nineteen years of age.\r\n\r\n      9 (return) [ According to Tertullian, (Apolog. c. 25,) he died at\r\n      Sirmium.

The young prince and his\r\n      profligate favorites revelled in all the license of sovereign\r\n      power; but his hands were yet unstained with blood; and he had\r\n      even displayed a generosity of sentiment, which might perhaps\r\n      have ripened into solid virtue. 13 A fatal incident decided his\r\n      fluctuating character.\r\n\r\n      13 (return) [ Manilius, the confidential secretary of Avidius\r\n      Cassius, was discovered after he had lain concealed several\r\n      years.

It had been\r\n      formed, not in the state, but within the walls of the palace.\r\n      Lucilla, the emperor’s sister, and widow of Lucius Verus,\r\n      impatient of the second rank, and jealous of the reigning\r\n      empress, had armed the murderer against her brother’s life. She\r\n      had not ventured to communicate the black design to her second\r\n      husband, Claudius Pompeiarus, a senator of distinguished merit\r\n      and unshaken loyalty; but among the crowd of her lovers (for she\r\n      imitated the manners of Faustina) she found men of desperate\r\n      fortunes and wild ambition, who were prepared to serve her more\r\n      violent, as well as her tender passions. The conspirators\r\n      experienced the rigor of justice, and the abandoned princess was\r\n      punished, first with exile, and afterwards with death. 15\r\n\r\n      14 (return) [See Maffei degli Amphitheatri, p. 126.]\r\n\r\n      15 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxi. p. 1205 Herodian, l. i. p. 16 Hist.\r\n      August p. 46.]\r\n\r\n      But the words of the assassin sunk deep into the mind of\r\n      Commodus, and left an indelible impression of fear and hatred\r\n      against the whole body of the senate. 151 Those whom he had\r\n      dreaded as importunate ministers, he now suspected as secret\r\n      enemies. The Delators, a race of men discouraged, and almost\r\n      extinguished, under the former reigns, again became formidable,\r\n      as soon as they discovered that the emperor was desirous of\r\n      finding disaffection and treason in the senate. That assembly,\r\n      whom Marcus had ever considered as the great council of the\r\n      nation, was composed of the most distinguished of the Romans; and\r\n      distinction of every kind soon became criminal. The possession of\r\n      wealth stimulated the diligence of the informers; rigid virtue\r\n      implied a tacit censure of the irregularities of Commodus;\r\n      important services implied a dangerous superiority of merit; and\r\n      the friendship of the father always insured the aversion of the\r\n      son. Suspicion was equivalent to proof; trial to condemnation.\r\n      The execution of a considerable senator was attended with the\r\n      death of all who might lament or revenge his fate; and when\r\n      Commodus had once tasted human blood, he became incapable of pity\r\n      or remorse.\r\n\r\n      151 (return) [ The conspirators were senators, even the assassin\r\n      himself.

Their studies\r\n      and their occupations, their pursuits and their pleasures, were\r\n      still the same. In the enjoyment of a great estate, they never\r\n      admitted the idea of a separate interest: some fragments are now\r\n      extant of a treatise which they composed in common; 152 and in\r\n      every action of life it was observed that their two bodies were\r\n      animated by one soul. The Antonines, who valued their virtues,\r\n      and delighted in their union, raised them, in the same year, to\r\n      the consulship; and Marcus afterwards intrusted to their joint\r\n      care the civil administration of Greece, and a great military\r\n      command, in which they obtained a signal victory over the\r\n      Germans. The kind cruelty of Commodus united them in death. 16\r\n\r\n      152 (return) [ This work was on agriculture, and is often quoted\r\n      by later writers. See P. Needham, Proleg. ad Geoponic.

Whilst Commodus was immersed in blood and luxury, he\r\n      devolved the detail of the public business on Perennis, a servile\r\n      and ambitious minister, who had obtained his post by the murder\r\n      of his predecessor, but who possessed a considerable share of\r\n      vigor and ability. By acts of extortion, and the forfeited\r\n      estates of the nobles sacrificed to his avarice, he had\r\n      accumulated an immense treasure. The Prætorian guards were under\r\n      his immediate command; and his son, who already discovered a\r\n      military genius, was at the head of the Illyrian legions.\r\n      Perennis aspired to the empire; or what, in the eyes of Commodus,\r\n      amounted to the same crime, he was capable of aspiring to it, had\r\n      he not been prevented, surprised, and put to death. The fall of a\r\n      minister is a very trifling incident in the general history of\r\n      the empire; but it was hastened by an extraordinary circumstance,\r\n      which proved how much the nerves of discipline were already\r\n      relaxed. The legions of Britain, discontented with the\r\n      administration of Perennis, formed a deputation of fifteen\r\n      hundred select men, with instructions to march to Rome, and lay\r\n      their complaints before the emperor. These military petitioners,\r\n      by their own determined behaviour, by inflaming the divisions of\r\n      the guards, by exaggerating the strength of the British army, and\r\n      by alarming the fears of Commodus, exacted and obtained the\r\n      minister’s death, as the only redress of their grievances. 17\r\n      This presumption of a distant army, and their discovery of the\r\n      weakness of government, was a sure presage of the most dreadful\r\n      convulsions.\r\n\r\n      17 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxii. p. 1210. Herodian, l. i. p. 22.\r\n      Hist. August. p. 48. Dion gives a much less odious character of\r\n      Perennis, than the other historians. His moderation is almost a\r\n      pledge of his veracity. Note: Gibbon praises Dion for the\r\n      moderation with which he speaks of Perennis: he follows,\r\n      nevertheless, in his own narrative, Herodian and Lampridius. Dion\r\n      speaks of Perennis not only with moderation, but with admiration;\r\n      he represents him as a great man, virtuous in his life, and\r\n      blameless in his death: perhaps he may be suspected of\r\n      partiality; but it is singular that Gibbon, having adopted, from\r\n      Herodian and Lampridius, their judgment on this minister, follows\r\n      Dion’s improbable account of his death. What likelihood, in fact,\r\n      that fifteen hundred men should have traversed Gaul and Italy,\r\n      and have arrived at Rome without any understanding with the\r\n      Prætorians, or without detection or opposition from Perennis, the\r\n      Prætorian præfect? Gibbon, foreseeing, perhaps, this difficulty,\r\n      has added, that the military deputation inflamed the divisions of\r\n      the guards; but Dion says expressly that they did not reach Rome,\r\n      but that the emperor went out to meet them: he even reproaches\r\n      him for not having opposed them with the guards, who were\r\n      superior in number. Herodian relates that Commodus, having\r\n      learned, from a soldier, the ambitious designs of Perennis and\r\n      his son, caused them to be attacked and massacred by night.—G.\r\n      from W. Dion’s narrative is remarkably circumstantial, and his\r\n      authority higher than either of the other writers. He hints that\r\n      Cleander, a new favorite, had already undermined the influence of\r\n      Perennis.—M.]\r\n\r\n      The negligence of the public administration was betrayed, soon\r\n      afterwards, by a new disorder, which arose from the smallest\r\n      beginnings. A spirit of desertion began to prevail among the\r\n      troops: and the deserters, instead of seeking their safety in\r\n      flight or concealment, infested the highways. Maternus, a private\r\n      soldier, of a daring boldness above his station, collected these\r\n      bands of robbers into a little army, set open the prisons,\r\n      invited the slaves to assert their freedom, and plundered with\r\n      impunity the rich and defenceless cities of Gaul and Spain. The\r\n      governors of the provinces, who had long been the spectators, and\r\n      perhaps the partners, of his depredations, were, at length,\r\n      roused from their supine indolence by the threatening commands of\r\n      the emperor. Maternus found that he was encompassed, and foresaw\r\n      that he must be overpowered. A great effort of despair was his\r\n      last resource. He ordered his followers to disperse, to pass the\r\n      Alps in small parties and various disguises, and to assemble at\r\n      Rome, during the licentious tumult of the festival of Cybele. 18\r\n      To murder Commodus, and to ascend the vacant throne, was the\r\n      ambition of no vulgar robber. His measures were so ably concerted\r\n      that his concealed troops already filled the streets of Rome. The\r\n      envy of an accomplice discovered and ruined this singular\r\n      enterprise, in a moment when it was ripe for execution. 19\r\n\r\n      18 (return) [ During the second Punic war, the Romans imported\r\n      from Asia the worship of the mother of the gods. Her festival,\r\n      the Megalesia, began on the fourth of April, and lasted six days.\r\n      The streets were crowded with mad processions, the theatres with\r\n      spectators, and the public tables with unbidden guests. Order and\r\n      police were suspended, and pleasure was the only serious business\r\n      of the city. See Ovid. de Fastis, l. iv. 189, &c.]\r\n\r\n      19 (return) [ Herodian, l. i. p. 23, 23.]\r\n\r\n      Suspicious princes often promote the last of mankind, from a vain\r\n      persuasion, that those who have no dependence, except on their\r\n      favor, will have no attachment, except to the person of their\r\n      benefactor. Cleander, the successor of Perennis, was a Phrygian\r\n      by birth; of a nation over whose stubborn, but servile temper,\r\n      blows only could prevail. 20 He had been sent from his native\r\n      country to Rome, in the capacity of a slave. As a slave he\r\n      entered the Imperial palace, rendered himself useful to his\r\n      master’s passions, and rapidly ascended to the most exalted\r\n      station which a subject could enjoy. His influence over the mind\r\n      of Commodus was much greater than that of his predecessor; for\r\n      Cleander was devoid of any ability or virtue which could inspire\r\n      the emperor with envy or distrust. Avarice was the reigning\r\n      passion of his soul, and the great principle of his\r\n      administration. The rank of Consul, of Patrician, of Senator, was\r\n      exposed to public sale; and it would have been considered as\r\n      disaffection, if any one had refused to purchase these empty and\r\n      disgraceful honors with the greatest part of his fortune. 21 In\r\n      the lucrative provincial employments, the minister shared with\r\n      the governor the spoils of the people. The execution of the laws\r\n      was penal and arbitrary. A wealthy criminal might obtain, not\r\n      only the reversal of the sentence by which he was justly\r\n      condemned, but might likewise inflict whatever punishment he\r\n      pleased on the accuser, the witnesses, and the judge.\r\n\r\n      20 (return) [ Cicero pro Flacco, c. 27.]\r\n\r\n      21 (return) [ One of these dear-bought promotions occasioned a\r\n      current... that Julius Solon was banished into the senate.]\r\n\r\n      By these means, Cleander, in the space of three years, had\r\n      accumulated more wealth than had ever yet been possessed by any\r\n      freedman. 22 Commodus was perfectly satisfied with the\r\n      magnificent presents which the artful courtier laid at his feet\r\n      in the most seasonable moments. To divert the public envy,\r\n      Cleander, under the emperor’s name, erected baths, porticos, and\r\n      places of exercise, for the use of the people. 23 He flattered\r\n      himself that the Romans, dazzled and amused by this apparent\r\n      liberality, would be less affected by the bloody scenes which\r\n      were daily exhibited; that they would forget the death of\r\n      Byrrhus, a senator to whose superior merit the late emperor had\r\n      granted one of his daughters; and that they would forgive the\r\n      execution of Arrius Antoninus, the last representative of the\r\n      name and virtues of the Antonines. The former, with more\r\n      integrity than prudence, had attempted to disclose, to his\r\n      brother-in-law, the true character of Cleander. An equitable\r\n      sentence pronounced by the latter, when proconsul of Asia,\r\n      against a worthless creature of the favorite, proved fatal to\r\n      him. 24 After the fall of Perennis, the terrors of Commodus had,\r\n      for a short time, assumed the appearance of a return to virtue.\r\n      He repealed the most odious of his acts; loaded his memory with\r\n      the public execration, and ascribed to the pernicious counsels of\r\n      that wicked minister all the errors of his inexperienced youth.\r\n      But his repentance lasted only thirty days; and, under Cleander’s\r\n      tyranny, the administration of Perennis was often regretted.\r\n\r\n      22 (return) [ Dion (l. lxxii. p. 12, 13) observes, that no\r\n      freedman had possessed riches equal to those of Cleander.

The popular discontent, after it\r\n      had long circulated in whispers, broke out in the assembled\r\n      circus. The people quitted their favorite amusements for the more\r\n      delicious pleasure of revenge, rushed in crowds towards a palace\r\n      in the suburbs, one of the emperor’s retirements, and demanded,\r\n      with angry clamors, the head of the public enemy. Cleander, who\r\n      commanded the Prætorian guards, 26 ordered a body of cavalry to\r\n      sally forth, and disperse the seditious multitude. The multitude\r\n      fled with precipitation towards the city; several were slain, and\r\n      many more were trampled to death; but when the cavalry entered\r\n      the streets, their pursuit was checked by a shower of stones and\r\n      darts from the roofs and windows of the houses. The foot guards,\r\n      27 who had been long jealous of the prerogatives and insolence of\r\n      the Prætorian cavalry, embraced the party of the people. The\r\n      tumult became a regular engagement, and threatened a general\r\n      massacre. The Prætorians, at length, gave way, oppressed with\r\n      numbers; and the tide of popular fury returned with redoubled\r\n      violence against the gates of the palace, where Commodus lay,\r\n      dissolved in luxury, and alone unconscious of the civil war. It\r\n      was death to approach his person with the unwelcome news. He\r\n      would have perished in this supine security, had not two women,\r\n      his eldest sister Fadilla, and Marcia, the most favored of his\r\n      concubines, ventured to break into his presence. Bathed in tears,\r\n      and with dishevelled hair, they threw themselves at his feet; and\r\n      with all the pressing eloquence of fear, discovered to the\r\n      affrighted emperor the crimes of the minister, the rage of the\r\n      people, and the impending ruin, which, in a few minutes, would\r\n      burst over his palace and person. Commodus started from his dream\r\n      of pleasure, and commanded that the head of Cleander should be\r\n      thrown out to the people. The desired spectacle instantly\r\n      appeased the tumult; and the son of Marcus might even yet have\r\n      regained the affection and confidence of his subjects. 28\r\n\r\n      25 (return) [ Herodian, l. i. p. 28.

Whilst he thus abandoned the reins of empire to\r\n      these unworthy favorites, he valued nothing in sovereign power,\r\n      except the unbounded license of indulging his sensual appetites.\r\n      His hours were spent in a seraglio of three hundred beautiful\r\n      women, and as many boys, of every rank, and of every province;\r\n      and, wherever the arts of seduction proved ineffectual, the\r\n      brutal lover had recourse to violence. The ancient historians 29\r\n      have expatiated on these abandoned scenes of prostitution, which\r\n      scorned every restraint of nature or modesty; but it would not be\r\n      easy to translate their too faithful descriptions into the\r\n      decency of modern language. The intervals of lust were filled up\r\n      with the basest amusements. The influence of a polite age, and\r\n      the labor of an attentive education, had never been able to\r\n      infuse into his rude and brutish mind the least tincture of\r\n      learning; and he was the first of the Roman emperors totally\r\n      devoid of taste for the pleasures of the understanding. Nero\r\n      himself excelled, or affected to excel, in the elegant arts of\r\n      music and poetry: nor should we despise his pursuits, had he not\r\n      converted the pleasing relaxation of a leisure hour into the\r\n      serious business and ambition of his life. But Commodus, from his\r\n      earliest infancy, discovered an aversion to whatever was rational\r\n      or liberal, and a fond attachment to the amusements of the\r\n      populace; the sports of the circus and amphitheatre, the combats\r\n      of gladiators, and the hunting of wild beasts. The masters in\r\n      every branch of learning, whom Marcus provided for his son, were\r\n      heard with inattention and disgust; whilst the Moors and\r\n      Parthians, who taught him to dart the javelin and to shoot with\r\n      the bow, found a disciple who delighted in his application, and\r\n      soon equalled the most skilful of his instructors in the\r\n      steadiness of the eye and the dexterity of the hand.\r\n\r\n      29 (return) [ Sororibus suis constupratis.

Aug. p. 47.]\r\n\r\n      The servile crowd, whose fortune depended on their master’s\r\n      vices, applauded these ignoble pursuits. The perfidious voice of\r\n      flattery reminded him, that by exploits of the same nature, by\r\n      the defeat of the Nemæan lion, and the slaughter of the wild boar\r\n      of Erymanthus, the Grecian Hercules had acquired a place among\r\n      the gods, and an immortal memory among men. They only forgot to\r\n      observe, that, in the first ages of society, when the fiercer\r\n      animals often dispute with man the possession of an unsettled\r\n      country, a successful war against those savages is one of the\r\n      most innocent and beneficial labors of heroism. In the civilized\r\n      state of the Roman empire, the wild beasts had long since retired\r\n      from the face of man, and the neighborhood of populous cities. To\r\n      surprise them in their solitary haunts, and to transport them to\r\n      Rome, that they might be slain in pomp by the hand of an emperor,\r\n      was an enterprise equally ridiculous for the prince and\r\n      oppressive for the people. 30 Ignorant of these distinctions,\r\n      Commodus eagerly embraced the glorious resemblance, and styled\r\n      himself (as we still read on his medals31) the _Roman Hercules_.\r\n      311 The club and the lion’s hide were placed by the side of the\r\n      throne, amongst the ensigns of sovereignty; and statues were\r\n      erected, in which Commodus was represented in the character, and\r\n      with the attributes, of the god, whose valor and dexterity he\r\n      endeavored to emulate in the daily course of his ferocious\r\n      amusements. 32\r\n\r\n      30 (return) [ The African lions, when pressed by hunger, infested\r\n      the open villages and cultivated country; and they infested them\r\n      with impunity.

On the appointed day, the various\r\n      motives of flattery, fear, and curiosity, attracted to the\r\n      amphitheatre an innumerable multitude of spectators; and some\r\n      degree of applause was deservedly bestowed on the uncommon skill\r\n      of the Imperial performer. Whether he aimed at the head or heart\r\n      of the animal, the wound was alike certain and mortal. With\r\n      arrows whose point was shaped into the form of crescent, Commodus\r\n      often intercepted the rapid career, and cut asunder the long,\r\n      bony neck of the ostrich. 33 A panther was let loose; and the\r\n      archer waited till he had leaped upon a trembling malefactor. In\r\n      the same instant the shaft flew, the beast dropped dead, and the\r\n      man remained unhurt. The dens of the amphitheatre disgorged at\r\n      once a hundred lions: a hundred darts from the unerring hand of\r\n      Commodus laid them dead as they run raging round the _Arena_.\r\n      Neither the huge bulk of the elephant, nor the scaly hide of the\r\n      rhinoceros, could defend them from his stroke. Æthiopia and India\r\n      yielded their most extraordinary productions; and several animals\r\n      were slain in the amphitheatre, which had been seen only in the\r\n      representations of art, or perhaps of fancy. 34 In all these\r\n      exhibitions, the securest precautions were used to protect the\r\n      person of the Roman Hercules from the desperate spring of any\r\n      savage, who might possibly disregard the dignity of the emperor\r\n      and the sanctity of the god. 35\r\n\r\n      33 (return) [ The ostrich’s neck is three feet long, and composed\r\n      of seventeen vertebræ.

The _Secutor_ was armed with a\r\n      helmet, sword, and buckler; his naked antagonist had only a large\r\n      net and a trident; with the one he endeavored to entangle, with\r\n      the other to despatch his enemy. If he missed the first throw, he\r\n      was obliged to fly from the pursuit of the _Secutor_, till he had\r\n      prepared his net for a second cast. 37 The emperor fought in this\r\n      character seven hundred and thirty-five several times. These\r\n      glorious achievements were carefully recorded in the public acts\r\n      of the empire; and that he might omit no circumstance of infamy,\r\n      he received from the common fund of gladiators a stipend so\r\n      exorbitant that it became a new and most ignominious tax upon the\r\n      Roman people. 38 It may be easily supposed, that in these\r\n      engagements the master of the world was always successful; in the\r\n      amphitheatre, his victories were not often sanguinary; but when\r\n      he exercised his skill in the school of gladiators, or his own\r\n      palace, his wretched antagonists were frequently honored with a\r\n      mortal wound from the hand of Commodus, and obliged to seal their\r\n      flattery with their blood. 39 He now disdained the appellation of\r\n      Hercules. The name of Paulus, a celebrated Secutor, was the only\r\n      one which delighted his ear. It was inscribed on his colossal\r\n      statues, and repeated in the redoubled acclamations 40 of the\r\n      mournful and applauding senate. 41 Claudius Pompeianus, the\r\n      virtuous husband of Lucilla, was the only senator who asserted\r\n      the honor of his rank. As a father, he permitted his sons to\r\n      consult their safety by attending the amphitheatre. As a Roman,\r\n      he declared, that his own life was in the emperor’s hands, but\r\n      that he would never behold the son of Marcus prostituting his\r\n      person and dignity. Notwithstanding his manly resolution\r\n      Pompeianus escaped the resentment of the tyrant, and, with his\r\n      honor, had the good fortune to preserve his life. 42\r\n\r\n      36 (return) [ The virtuous and even the wise princes forbade the\r\n      senators and knights to embrace this scandalous profession, under\r\n      pain of infamy, or, what was more dreaded by those profligate\r\n      wretches, of exile.

Amidst\r\n      the acclamations of a flattering court, he was unable to disguise\r\n      from himself, that he had deserved the contempt and hatred of\r\n      every man of sense and virtue in his empire. His ferocious spirit\r\n      was irritated by the consciousness of that hatred, by the envy of\r\n      every kind of merit, by the just apprehension of danger, and by\r\n      the habit of slaughter, which he contracted in his daily\r\n      amusements. History has preserved a long list of consular\r\n      senators sacrificed to his wanton suspicion, which sought out,\r\n      with peculiar anxiety, those unfortunate persons connected,\r\n      however remotely, with the family of the Antonines, without\r\n      sparing even the ministers of his crimes or pleasures. 43 His\r\n      cruelty proved at last fatal to himself. He had shed with\r\n      impunity the noblest blood of Rome: he perished as soon as he was\r\n      dreaded by his own domestics. Marcia, his favorite concubine,\r\n      Eclectus, his chamberlain, and Lætus, his Prætorian præfect,\r\n      alarmed by the fate of their companions and predecessors,\r\n      resolved to prevent the destruction which every hour hung over\r\n      their heads, either from the mad caprice of the tyrant, 431 or\r\n      the sudden indignation of the people. Marcia seized the occasion\r\n      of presenting a draught of wine to her lover, after he had\r\n      fatigued himself with hunting some wild beasts. Commodus retired\r\n      to sleep; but whilst he was laboring with the effects of poison\r\n      and drunkenness, a robust youth, by profession a wrestler,\r\n      entered his chamber, and strangled him without resistance. The\r\n      body was secretly conveyed out of the palace, before the least\r\n      suspicion was entertained in the city, or even in the court, of\r\n      the emperor’s death. Such was the fate of the son of Marcus, and\r\n      so easy was it to destroy a hated tyrant, who, by the artificial\r\n      powers of government, had oppressed, during thirteen years, so\r\n      many millions of subjects, each of whom was equal to their master\r\n      in personal strength and personal abilities. 44\r\n\r\n      43 (return) [ The prefects were changed almost hourly or daily;\r\n      and the caprice of Commodus was often fatal to his most favored\r\n      chamberlains.

They resolved instantly to fill the vacant\r\n      throne with an emperor whose character would justify and maintain\r\n      the action that had been committed. They fixed on Pertinax,\r\n      præfect of the city, an ancient senator of consular rank, whose\r\n      conspicuous merit had broke through the obscurity of his birth,\r\n      and raised him to the first honors of the state. He had\r\n      successively governed most of the provinces of the empire; and in\r\n      all his great employments, military as well as civil, he had\r\n      uniformly distinguished himself by the firmness, the prudence,\r\n      and the integrity of his conduct. 45 He now remained almost alone\r\n      of the friends and ministers of Marcus; and when, at a late hour\r\n      of the night, he was awakened with the news, that the chamberlain\r\n      and the præfect were at his door, he received them with intrepid\r\n      resignation, and desired they would execute their master’s\r\n      orders. Instead of death, they offered him the throne of the\r\n      Roman world. During some moments he distrusted their intentions\r\n      and assurances. Convinced at length of the death of Commodus, he\r\n      accepted the purple with a sincere reluctance, the natural effect\r\n      of his knowledge both of the duties and of the dangers of the\r\n      supreme rank. 46\r\n\r\n      45 (return) [ Pertinax was a native of Alba Pompeia, in Piedmont,\r\n      and son of a timber merchant.

This important\r\n      night was now far spent; with the dawn of day, and the\r\n      commencement of the new year, the senators expected a summons to\r\n      attend an ignominious ceremony. 461 In spite of all\r\n      remonstrances, even of those of his creatures who yet preserved\r\n      any regard for prudence or decency, Commodus had resolved to pass\r\n      the night in the gladiators’ school, and from thence to take\r\n      possession of the consulship, in the habit and with the\r\n      attendance of that infamous crew. On a sudden, before the break\r\n      of day, the senate was called together in the temple of Concord,\r\n      to meet the guards, and to ratify the election of a new emperor.\r\n      For a few minutes they sat in silent suspense, doubtful of their\r\n      unexpected deliverance, and suspicious of the cruel artifices of\r\n      Commodus: but when at length they were assured that the tyrant\r\n      was no more, they resigned themselves to all the transports of\r\n      joy and indignation. Pertinax, who modestly represented the\r\n      meanness of his extraction, and pointed out several noble\r\n      senators more deserving than himself of the empire, was\r\n      constrained by their dutiful violence to ascend the throne, and\r\n      received all the titles of Imperial power, confirmed by the most\r\n      sincere vows of fidelity. The memory of Commodus was branded with\r\n      eternal infamy. The names of tyrant, of gladiator, of public\r\n      enemy resounded in every corner of the house. They decreed in\r\n      tumultuous votes, 462 that his honors should be reversed, his\r\n      titles erased from the public monuments, his statues thrown down,\r\n      his body dragged with a hook into the stripping room of the\r\n      gladiators, to satiate the public fury; and they expressed some\r\n      indignation against those officious servants who had already\r\n      presumed to screen his remains from the justice of the senate.\r\n      But Pertinax could not refuse those last rites to the memory of\r\n      Marcus, and the tears of his first protector Claudius Pompeianus,\r\n      who lamented the cruel fate of his brother-in-law, and lamented\r\n      still more that he had deserved it. 47\r\n\r\n      461 (return) [ The senate always assembled at the beginning of\r\n      the year, on the night of the 1st January, (see Savaron on Sid.\r\n      Apoll. viii. 6,) and this happened the present year, as usual,\r\n      without any particular order.—G from W.]\r\n\r\n      462 (return) [ What Gibbon improperly calls, both here and in the\r\n      note, tumultuous decrees, were no more than the applauses and\r\n      acclamations which recur so often in the history of the emperors.\r\n      The custom passed from the theatre to the forum, from the forum\r\n      to the senate. Applauses on the adoption of the Imperial decrees\r\n      were first introduced under Trajan. (Plin. jun. Panegyr. 75.) One\r\n      senator read the form of the decree, and all the rest answered by\r\n      acclamations, accompanied with a kind of chant or rhythm.

To censure, to depose,\r\n      or to punish with death, the first magistrate of the republic,\r\n      who had abused his delegated trust, was the ancient and undoubted\r\n      prerogative of the Roman senate; 48 but the feeble assembly was\r\n      obliged to content itself with inflicting on a fallen tyrant that\r\n      public justice, from which, during his life and reign, he had\r\n      been shielded by the strong arm of military despotism. 481\r\n\r\n      48 (return) [ The senate condemned Nero to be put to death more\r\n      majorum.

Gibbon appears to infer, from the passage of Suetonius,\r\n      that the senate, according to its ancient right, punished Nero\r\n      with death. The words, however, more majerum refer not to the\r\n      decree of the senate, but to the kind of death, which was taken\r\n      from an old law of Romulus. (See Victor. Epit. Ed. Artzen p. 484,\r\n      n. 7.)—W.]\r\n\r\n      Pertinax found a nobler way of condemning his predecessor’s\r\n      memory; by the contrast of his own virtues with the vices of\r\n      Commodus. On the day of his accession, he resigned over to his\r\n      wife and son his whole private fortune; that they might have no\r\n      pretence to solicit favors at the expense of the state. He\r\n      refused to flatter the vanity of the former with the title of\r\n      Augusta; or to corrupt the inexperienced youth of the latter by\r\n      the rank of Cæsar. Accurately distinguishing between the duties\r\n      of a parent and those of a sovereign, he educated his son with a\r\n      severe simplicity, which, while it gave him no assured prospect\r\n      of the throne, might in time have rendered him worthy of it. In\r\n      public, the behavior of Pertinax was grave and affable. He lived\r\n      with the virtuous part of the senate, (and, in a private station,\r\n      he had been acquainted with the true character of each\r\n      individual,) without either pride or jealousy; considered them as\r\n      friends and companions, with whom he had shared the danger of the\r\n      tyranny, and with whom he wished to enjoy the security of the\r\n      present time. He very frequently invited them to familiar\r\n      entertainments, the frugality of which was ridiculed by those who\r\n      remembered and regretted the luxurious prodigality of Commodus.\r\n      49\r\n\r\n      49 (return) [ Dion (l. lxxiii. p. 1223) speaks of these\r\n      entertainments, as a senator who had supped with the emperor;\r\n      Capitolinus, (Hist. August. p. 58,) like a slave, who had\r\n      received his intelligence from one the scullions.]\r\n\r\n      To heal, as far as it was possible, the wounds inflicted by the\r\n      hand of tyranny, was the pleasing, but melancholy, task of\r\n      Pertinax. The innocent victims, who yet survived, were recalled\r\n      from exile, released from prison, and restored to the full\r\n      possession of their honors and fortunes. The unburied bodies of\r\n      murdered senators (for the cruelty of Commodus endeavored to\r\n      extend itself beyond death) were deposited in the sepulchres of\r\n      their ancestors; their memory was justified and every consolation\r\n      was bestowed on their ruined and afflicted families. Among these\r\n      consolations, one of the most grateful was the punishment of the\r\n      Delators; the common enemies of their master, of virtue, and of\r\n      their country. Yet even in the inquisition of these legal\r\n      assassins, Pertinax proceeded with a steady temper, which gave\r\n      every thing to justice, and nothing to popular prejudice and\r\n      resentment.\r\n\r\n      The finances of the state demanded the most vigilant care of the\r\n      emperor. Though every measure of injustice and extortion had been\r\n      adopted, which could collect the property of the subject into the\r\n      coffers of the prince, the rapaciousness of Commodus had been so\r\n      very inadequate to his extravagance, that, upon his death, no\r\n      more than eight thousand pounds were found in the exhausted\r\n      treasury, 50 to defray the current expenses of government, and to\r\n      discharge the pressing demand of a liberal donative, which the\r\n      new emperor had been obliged to promise to the Prætorian guards.\r\n      Yet under these distressed circumstances, Pertinax had the\r\n      generous firmness to remit all the oppressive taxes invented by\r\n      Commodus, and to cancel all the unjust claims of the treasury;\r\n      declaring, in a decree of the senate, “that he was better\r\n      satisfied to administer a poor republic with innocence, than to\r\n      acquire riches by the ways of tyranny and dishonor.” Economy and\r\n      industry he considered as the pure and genuine sources of wealth;\r\n      and from them he soon derived a copious supply for the public\r\n      necessities. The expense of the household was immediately reduced\r\n      to one half. All the instruments of luxury Pertinax exposed to\r\n      public auction, 51 gold and silver plate, chariots of a singular\r\n      construction, a superfluous wardrobe of silk and embroidery, and\r\n      a great number of beautiful slaves of both sexes; excepting only,\r\n      with attentive humanity, those who were born in a state of\r\n      freedom, and had been ravished from the arms of their weeping\r\n      parents. At the same time that he obliged the worthless favorites\r\n      of the tyrant to resign a part of their ill-gotten wealth, he\r\n      satisfied the just creditors of the state, and unexpectedly\r\n      discharged the long arrears of honest services. He removed the\r\n      oppressive restrictions which had been laid upon commerce, and\r\n      granted all the uncultivated lands in Italy and the provinces to\r\n      those who would improve them; with an exemption from tribute\r\n      during the term of ten years. 52\r\n\r\n      50 (return) [ Decies.

A hasty zeal to\r\n      reform the corrupted state, accompanied with less prudence than\r\n      might have been expected from the years and experience of\r\n      Pertinax, proved fatal to himself and to his country. His honest\r\n      indiscretion united against him the servile crowd, who found\r\n      their private benefit in the public disorders, and who preferred\r\n      the favor of a tyrant to the inexorable equality of the laws. 53\r\n\r\n      53 (return) [ Leges, rem surdam, inexorabilem esse. T. Liv. ii.\r\n      3.]\r\n\r\n      Amidst the general joy, the sullen and angry countenance of the\r\n      Prætorian guards betrayed their inward dissatisfaction. They had\r\n      reluctantly submitted to Pertinax; they dreaded the strictness of\r\n      the ancient discipline, which he was preparing to restore; and\r\n      they regretted the license of the former reign. Their discontents\r\n      were secretly fomented by Lætus, their præfect, who found, when\r\n      it was too late, that his new emperor would reward a servant, but\r\n      would not be ruled by a favorite. On the third day of his reign,\r\n      the soldiers seized on a noble senator, with a design to carry\r\n      him to the camp, and to invest him with the Imperial purple.\r\n      Instead of being dazzled by the dangerous honor, the affrighted\r\n      victim escaped from their violence, and took refuge at the feet\r\n      of Pertinax. A short time afterwards, Sosius Falco, one of the\r\n      consuls of the year, a rash youth, 54 but of an ancient and\r\n      opulent family, listened to the voice of ambition; and a\r\n      conspiracy was formed during a short absence of Pertinax, which\r\n      was crushed by his sudden return to Rome, and his resolute\r\n      behavior. Falco was on the point of being justly condemned to\r\n      death as a public enemy had he not been saved by the earnest and\r\n      sincere entreaties of the injured emperor, who conjured the\r\n      senate, that the purity of his reign might not be stained by the\r\n      blood even of a guilty senator.\r\n\r\n      54 (return) [ If we credit Capitolinus, (which is rather\r\n      difficult,) Falco behaved with the most petulant indecency to\r\n      Pertinax, on the day of his accession.

August. p.\r\n      55.]\r\n\r\n      These disappointments served only to irritate the rage of the\r\n      Prætorian guards. On the twenty-eighth of March, eighty-six days\r\n      only after the death of Commodus, a general sedition broke out in\r\n      the camp, which the officers wanted either power or inclination\r\n      to suppress. Two or three hundred of the most desperate soldiers\r\n      marched at noonday, with arms in their hands and fury in their\r\n      looks, towards the Imperial palace. The gates were thrown open by\r\n      their companions upon guard, and by the domestics of the old\r\n      court, who had already formed a secret conspiracy against the\r\n      life of the too virtuous emperor. On the news of their approach,\r\n      Pertinax, disdaining either flight or concealment, advanced to\r\n      meet his assassins; and recalled to their minds his own\r\n      innocence, and the sanctity of their recent oath. For a few\r\n      moments they stood in silent suspense, ashamed of their atrocious\r\n      design, and awed by the venerable aspect and majestic firmness of\r\n      their sovereign, till at length, the despair of pardon reviving\r\n      their fury, a barbarian of the country of Tongress 55 levelled\r\n      the first blow against Pertinax, who was instantly despatched\r\n      with a multitude of wounds. His head, separated from his body,\r\n      and placed on a lance, was carried in triumph to the Prætorian\r\n      camp, in the sight of a mournful and indignant people, who\r\n      lamented the unworthy fate of that excellent prince, and the\r\n      transient blessings of a reign, the memory of which could serve\r\n      only to aggravate their approaching misfortunes. 56\r\n\r\n      55 (return) [ The modern bishopric of Liege.

It has been calculated by\r\n      the ablest politicians, that no state, without being soon\r\n      exhausted, can maintain above the hundredth part of its members\r\n      in arms and idleness. But although this relative proportion may\r\n      be uniform, the influence of the army over the rest of the\r\n      society will vary according to the degree of its positive\r\n      strength. The advantages of military science and discipline\r\n      cannot be exerted, unless a proper number of soldiers are united\r\n      into one body, and actuated by one soul. With a handful of men,\r\n      such a union would be ineffectual; with an unwieldy host, it\r\n      would be impracticable; and the powers of the machine would be\r\n      alike destroyed by the extreme minuteness or the excessive weight\r\n      of its springs. To illustrate this observation, we need only\r\n      reflect, that there is no superiority of natural strength,\r\n      artificial weapons, or acquired skill, which could enable one man\r\n      to keep in constant subjection one hundred of his\r\n      fellow-creatures: the tyrant of a single town, or a small\r\n      district, would soon discover that a hundred armed followers were\r\n      a weak defence against ten thousand peasants or citizens; but a\r\n      hundred thousand well-disciplined soldiers will command, with\r\n      despotic sway, ten millions of subjects; and a body of ten or\r\n      fifteen thousand guards will strike terror into the most numerous\r\n      populace that ever crowded the streets of an immense capital.\r\n\r\n      The Prætorian bands, whose licentious fury was the first symptom\r\n      and cause of the decline of the Roman empire, scarcely amounted\r\n      to the last-mentioned number. 1 They derived their institution\r\n      from Augustus. That crafty tyrant, sensible that laws might\r\n      color, but that arms alone could maintain, his usurped dominion,\r\n      had gradually formed this powerful body of guards, in constant\r\n      readiness to protect his person, to awe the senate, and either to\r\n      prevent or to crush the first motions of rebellion. He\r\n      distinguished these favored troops by a double pay and superior\r\n      privileges; but, as their formidable aspect would at once have\r\n      alarmed and irritated the Roman people, three cohorts only were\r\n      stationed in the capital, whilst the remainder was dispersed in\r\n      the adjacent towns of Italy. 2 But after fifty years of peace and\r\n      servitude, Tiberius ventured on a decisive measure, which forever\r\n      rivetted the fetters of his country. Under the fair pretences of\r\n      relieving Italy from the heavy burden of military quarters, and\r\n      of introducing a stricter discipline among the guards, he\r\n      assembled them at Rome, in a permanent camp, 3 which was\r\n      fortified with skilful care, 4 and placed on a commanding\r\n      situation. 5\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ They were originally nine or ten thousand men, (for\r\n      Tacitus and son are not agreed upon the subject,) divided into as\r\n      many cohorts.

Cramer’s Italy 390.—M.]\r\n\r\n      Such formidable servants are always necessary, but often fatal to\r\n      the throne of despotism. By thus introducing the Prætorian guards\r\n      as it were into the palace and the senate, the emperors taught\r\n      them to perceive their own strength, and the weakness of the\r\n      civil government; to view the vices of their masters with\r\n      familiar contempt, and to lay aside that reverential awe, which\r\n      distance only, and mystery, can preserve towards an imaginary\r\n      power. In the luxurious idleness of an opulent city, their pride\r\n      was nourished by the sense of their irresistible weight; nor was\r\n      it possible to conceal from them, that the person of the\r\n      sovereign, the authority of the senate, the public treasure, and\r\n      the seat of empire, were all in their hands. To divert the\r\n      Prætorian bands from these dangerous reflections, the firmest and\r\n      best established princes were obliged to mix blandishments with\r\n      commands, rewards with punishments, to flatter their pride,\r\n      indulge their pleasures, connive at their irregularities, and to\r\n      purchase their precarious faith by a liberal donative; which,\r\n      since the elevation of Claudius, was enacted as a legal claim, on\r\n      the accession of every new emperor. 6\r\n\r\n      6 (return) [ Claudius, raised by the soldiers to the empire, was\r\n      the first who gave a donative.

We may form some idea of the amount of these sums, by\r\n      Hadrian’s complaint that the promotion of a Cæsar had cost him\r\n      ter millies, two millions and a half sterling.]\r\n\r\n      The advocate of the guards endeavored to justify by arguments the\r\n      power which they asserted by arms; and to maintain that,\r\n      according to the purest principles of the constitution, _their_\r\n      consent was essentially necessary in the appointment of an\r\n      emperor. The election of consuls, of generals, and of\r\n      magistrates, however it had been recently usurped by the senate,\r\n      was the ancient and undoubted right of the Roman people. 7 But\r\n      where was the Roman people to be found? Not surely amongst the\r\n      mixed multitude of slaves and strangers that filled the streets\r\n      of Rome; a servile populace, as devoid of spirit as destitute of\r\n      property. The defenders of the state, selected from the flower of\r\n      the Italian youth, 8 and trained in the exercise of arms and\r\n      virtue, were the genuine representatives of the people, and the\r\n      best entitled to elect the military chief of the republic. These\r\n      assertions, however defective in reason, became unanswerable when\r\n      the fierce Prætorians increased their weight, by throwing, like\r\n      the barbarian conqueror of Rome, their swords into the scale. 9\r\n\r\n      7 (return) [ Cicero de Legibus, iii. 3.

The camp was without a leader, for\r\n      even the præfect Lætus, who had excited the tempest, prudently\r\n      declined the public indignation. Amidst the wild disorder,\r\n      Sulpicianus, the emperor’s father-in-law, and governor of the\r\n      city, who had been sent to the camp on the first alarm of mutiny,\r\n      was endeavoring to calm the fury of the multitude, when he was\r\n      silenced by the clamorous return of the murderers, bearing on a\r\n      lance the head of Pertinax. Though history has accustomed us to\r\n      observe every principle and every passion yielding to the\r\n      imperious dictates of ambition, it is scarcely credible that, in\r\n      these moments of horror, Sulpicianus should have aspired to\r\n      ascend a throne polluted with the recent blood of so near a\r\n      relation and so excellent a prince. He had already begun to use\r\n      the only effectual argument, and to treat for the Imperial\r\n      dignity; but the more prudent of the Prætorians, apprehensive\r\n      that, in this private contract, they should not obtain a just\r\n      price for so valuable a commodity, ran out upon the ramparts;\r\n      and, with a loud voice, proclaimed that the Roman world was to be\r\n      disposed of to the best bidder by public auction. 10\r\n\r\n      10 (return) [ Dion, L. lxxiii. p. 1234.

It reached at length the ears of Didius\r\n      Julianus, a wealthy senator, who, regardless of the public\r\n      calamities, was indulging himself in the luxury of the table. 11\r\n      His wife and his daughter, his freedmen and his parasites, easily\r\n      convinced him that he deserved the throne, and earnestly conjured\r\n      him to embrace so fortunate an opportunity. The vain old man\r\n      hastened to the Prætorian camp, where Sulpicianus was still in\r\n      treaty with the guards, and began to bid against him from the\r\n      foot of the rampart. The unworthy negotiation was transacted by\r\n      faithful emissaries, who passed alternately from one candidate to\r\n      the other, and acquainted each of them with the offers of his\r\n      rival. Sulpicianus had already promised a donative of five\r\n      thousand drachms (above one hundred and sixty pounds) to each\r\n      soldier; when Julian, eager for the prize, rose at once to the\r\n      sum of six thousand two hundred and fifty drachms, or upwards of\r\n      two hundred pounds sterling. The gates of the camp were instantly\r\n      thrown open to the purchaser; he was declared emperor, and\r\n      received an oath of allegiance from the soldiers, who retained\r\n      humanity enough to stipulate that he should pardon and forget the\r\n      competition of Sulpicianus. 111\r\n\r\n      11 (return) [ Spartianus softens the most odious parts of the\r\n      character and elevation of Julian.]\r\n\r\n      111 (return) [ One of the principal causes of the preference of\r\n      Julianus by the soldiers, was the dexterty dexterity with which\r\n      he reminded them that Sulpicianus would not fail to revenge on\r\n      them the death of his son-in-law. (See Dion, p. 1234, 1234. c.\r\n      11. Herod. ii. 6.)—W.]\r\n\r\n      It was now incumbent on the Prætorians to fulfil the conditions\r\n      of the sale. They placed their new sovereign, whom they served\r\n      and despised, in the centre of their ranks, surrounded him on\r\n      every side with their shields, and conducted him in close order\r\n      of battle through the deserted streets of the city. The senate\r\n      was commanded to assemble; and those who had been the\r\n      distinguished friends of Pertinax, or the personal enemies of\r\n      Julian, found it necessary to affect a more than common share of\r\n      satisfaction at this happy revolution. 12 After Julian had filled\r\n      the senate house with armed soldiers, he expatiated on the\r\n      freedom of his election, his own eminent virtues, and his full\r\n      assurance of the affections of the senate. The obsequious\r\n      assembly congratulated their own and the public felicity; engaged\r\n      their allegiance, and conferred on him all the several branches\r\n      of the Imperial power. 13 From the senate Julian was conducted,\r\n      by the same military procession, to take possession of the\r\n      palace. The first objects that struck his eyes, were the\r\n      abandoned trunk of Pertinax, and the frugal entertainment\r\n      prepared for his supper. The one he viewed with indifference, the\r\n      other with contempt. A magnificent feast was prepared by his\r\n      order, and he amused himself, till a very late hour, with dice,\r\n      and the performances of Pylades, a celebrated dancer. Yet it was\r\n      observed, that after the crowd of flatterers dispersed, and left\r\n      him to darkness, solitude, and terrible reflection, he passed a\r\n      sleepless night; revolving most probably in his mind his own rash\r\n      folly, the fate of his virtuous predecessor, and the doubtful and\r\n      dangerous tenure of an empire which had not been acquired by\r\n      merit, but purchased by money. 14\r\n\r\n      12 (return) [ Dion Cassius, at that time prætor, had been a\r\n      personal enemy to Julian, i. lxxiii. p. 1235.]\r\n\r\n      13 (return) [ Hist.

We learn from thence one\r\n      curious circumstance, that the new emperor, whatever had been his\r\n      birth, was immediately aggregated to the number of patrician\r\n      families. Note: A new fragment of Dion shows some shrewdness in\r\n      the character of Julian. When the senate voted him a golden\r\n      statue, he preferred one of brass, as more lasting. He “had\r\n      always observed,” he said, “that the statues of former emperors\r\n      were soon destroyed. Those of brass alone remained.” The\r\n      indignant historian adds that he was wrong.

On the throne of the world he found\r\n      himself without a friend, and even without an adherent. The\r\n      guards themselves were ashamed of the prince whom their avarice\r\n      had persuaded them to accept; nor was there a citizen who did not\r\n      consider his elevation with horror, as the last insult on the\r\n      Roman name. The nobility, whose conspicuous station, and ample\r\n      possessions, exacted the strictest caution, dissembled their\r\n      sentiments, and met the affected civility of the emperor with\r\n      smiles of complacency and professions of duty. But the people,\r\n      secure in their numbers and obscurity, gave a free vent to their\r\n      passions. The streets and public places of Rome resounded with\r\n      clamors and imprecations. The enraged multitude affronted the\r\n      person of Julian, rejected his liberality, and, conscious of the\r\n      impotence of their own resentment, they called aloud on the\r\n      legions of the frontiers to assert the violated majesty of the\r\n      Roman empire. The public discontent was soon diffused from the\r\n      centre to the frontiers of the empire. The armies of Britain, of\r\n      Syria, and of Illyricum, lamented the death of Pertinax, in whose\r\n      company, or under whose command, they had so often fought and\r\n      conquered. They received with surprise, with indignation, and\r\n      perhaps with envy, the extraordinary intelligence, that the\r\n      Prætorians had disposed of the empire by public auction; and they\r\n      sternly refused to ratify the ignominious bargain. Their\r\n      immediate and unanimous revolt was fatal to Julian, but it was\r\n      fatal at the same time to the public peace, as the generals of\r\n      the respective armies, Clodius Albinus, Pescennius Niger, and\r\n      Septimius Severus, were still more anxious to succeed than to\r\n      revenge the murdered Pertinax. Their forces were exactly\r\n      balanced. Each of them was at the head of three legions, 15 with\r\n      a numerous train of auxiliaries; and however different in their\r\n      characters, they were all soldiers of experience and capacity.\r\n\r\n      15 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxiii. p. 1235.]\r\n\r\n      Clodius Albinus, governor of Britain, surpassed both his\r\n      competitors in the nobility of his extraction, which he derived\r\n      from some of the most illustrious names of the old republic. 16\r\n      But the branch from which he claimed his descent was sunk into\r\n      mean circumstances, and transplanted into a remote province. It\r\n      is difficult to form a just idea of his true character. Under the\r\n      philosophic cloak of austerity, he stands accused of concealing\r\n      most of the vices which degrade human nature. 17 But his accusers\r\n      are those venal writers who adored the fortune of Severus, and\r\n      trampled on the ashes of an unsuccessful rival. Virtue, or the\r\n      appearances of virtue, recommended Albinus to the confidence and\r\n      good opinion of Marcus; and his preserving with the son the same\r\n      interest which he had acquired with the father, is a proof at\r\n      least that he was possessed of a very flexible disposition. The\r\n      favor of a tyrant does not always suppose a want of merit in the\r\n      object of it; he may, without intending it, reward a man of worth\r\n      and ability, or he may find such a man useful to his own service.\r\n      It does not appear that Albinus served the son of Marcus, either\r\n      as the minister of his cruelties, or even as the associate of his\r\n      pleasures. He was employed in a distant honorable command, when\r\n      he received a confidential letter from the emperor, acquainting\r\n      him of the treasonable designs of some discontented generals, and\r\n      authorizing him to declare himself the guardian and successor of\r\n      the throne, by assuming the title and ensigns of Cæsar. 18 The\r\n      governor of Britain wisely declined the dangerous honor, which\r\n      would have marked him for the jealousy, or involved him in the\r\n      approaching ruin, of Commodus. He courted power by nobler, or, at\r\n      least, by more specious arts. On a premature report of the death\r\n      of the emperor, he assembled his troops; and, in an eloquent\r\n      discourse, deplored the inevitable mischiefs of despotism,\r\n      described the happiness and glory which their ancestors had\r\n      enjoyed under the consular government, and declared his firm\r\n      resolution to reinstate the senate and people in their legal\r\n      authority. This popular harangue was answered by the loud\r\n      acclamations of the British legions, and received at Rome with a\r\n      secret murmur of applause. Safe in the possession of his little\r\n      world, and in the command of an army less distinguished indeed\r\n      for discipline than for numbers and valor, 19 Albinus braved the\r\n      menaces of Commodus, maintained towards Pertinax a stately\r\n      ambiguous reserve, and instantly declared against the usurpation\r\n      of Julian. The convulsions of the capital added new weight to his\r\n      sentiments, or rather to his professions of patriotism. A regard\r\n      to decency induced him to decline the lofty titles of Augustus\r\n      and Emperor; and he imitated perhaps the example of Galba, who,\r\n      on a similar occasion, had styled himself the Lieutenant of the\r\n      senate and people. 20\r\n\r\n      16 (return) [ The Posthumian and the Ce’onian; the former of whom\r\n      was raised to the consulship in the fifth year after its\r\n      institution.]\r\n\r\n      17 (return) [ Spartianus, in his undigested collections, mixes up\r\n      all the virtues and all the vices that enter into the human\r\n      composition, and bestows them on the same object.

Yet his parts seem to have been\r\n      better suited to the second than to the first rank; he was an\r\n      unequal rival, though he might have approved himself an excellent\r\n      lieutenant, to Severus, who afterwards displayed the greatness of\r\n      his mind by adopting several useful institutions from a\r\n      vanquished enemy. 21 In his government Niger acquired the esteem\r\n      of the soldiers and the love of the provincials. His rigid\r\n      discipline fortified the valor and confirmed the obedience of the\r\n      former, whilst the voluptuous Syrians were less delighted with\r\n      the mild firmness of his administration, than with the affability\r\n      of his manners, and the apparent pleasure with which he attended\r\n      their frequent and pompous festivals. 22 As soon as the\r\n      intelligence of the atrocious murder of Pertinax had reached\r\n      Antioch, the wishes of Asia invited Niger to assume the Imperial\r\n      purple and revenge his death. The legions of the eastern frontier\r\n      embraced his cause; the opulent but unarmed provinces, from the\r\n      frontiers of Æthiopia 23 to the Hadriatic, cheerfully submitted\r\n      to his power; and the kings beyond the Tigris and the Euphrates\r\n      congratulated his election, and offered him their homage and\r\n      services. The mind of Niger was not capable of receiving this\r\n      sudden tide of fortune: he flattered himself that his accession\r\n      would be undisturbed by competition and unstained by civil blood;\r\n      and whilst he enjoyed the vain pomp of triumph, he neglected to\r\n      secure the means of victory. Instead of entering into an\r\n      effectual negotiation with the powerful armies of the West, whose\r\n      resolution might decide, or at least must balance, the mighty\r\n      contest; instead of advancing without delay towards Rome and\r\n      Italy, where his presence was impatiently expected, 24 Niger\r\n      trifled away in the luxury of Antioch those irretrievable moments\r\n      which were diligently improved by the decisive activity of\r\n      Severus. 25\r\n\r\n      21 (return) [ Hist.

In the defence of\r\n      national freedom, two hundred thousand of these barbarians had\r\n      once appeared in the field, alarmed the declining age of\r\n      Augustus, and exercised the vigilant prudence of Tiberius at the\r\n      head of the collected force of the empire. 26 The Pannonians\r\n      yielded at length to the arms and institutions of Rome. Their\r\n      recent subjection, however, the neighborhood, and even the\r\n      mixture, of the unconquered tribes, and perhaps the climate,\r\n      adapted, as it has been observed, to the production of great\r\n      bodies and slow minds, 27 all contributed to preserve some\r\n      remains of their original ferocity, and under the tame and\r\n      uniform countenance of Roman provincials, the hardy features of\r\n      the natives were still to be discerned. Their warlike youth\r\n      afforded an inexhaustible supply of recruits to the legions\r\n      stationed on the banks of the Danube, and which, from a perpetual\r\n      warfare against the Germans and Sarmazans, were deservedly\r\n      esteemed the best troops in the service.\r\n\r\n      26 (return) [ See an account of that memorable war in Velleius\r\n      Paterculus, is 110, &c., who served in the army of Tiberius.]\r\n\r\n      27 (return) [ Such is the reflection of Herodian, l. ii. p. 74.\r\n      Will the modern Austrians allow the influence?]\r\n\r\n      The Pannonian army was at this time commanded by Septimius\r\n      Severus, a native of Africa, who, in the gradual ascent of\r\n      private honors, had concealed his daring ambition, which was\r\n      never diverted from its steady course by the allurements of\r\n      pleasure, the apprehension of danger, or the feelings of\r\n      humanity. 28 On the first news of the murder of Pertinax, he\r\n      assembled his troops, painted in the most lively colors the\r\n      crime, the insolence, and the weakness of the Prætorian guards,\r\n      and animated the legions to arms and to revenge. He concluded\r\n      (and the peroration was thought extremely eloquent) with\r\n      promising every soldier about four hundred pounds; an honorable\r\n      donative, double in value to the infamous bribe with which Julian\r\n      had purchased the empire. 29 The acclamations of the army\r\n      immediately saluted Severus with the names of Augustus, Pertinax,\r\n      and Emperor; and he thus attained the lofty station to which he\r\n      was invited, by conscious merit and a long train of dreams and\r\n      omens, the fruitful offsprings either of his superstition or\r\n      policy. 30\r\n\r\n      28 (return) [ In the letter to Albinus, already mentioned,\r\n      Commodus accuses Severus, as one of the ambitious generals who\r\n      censured his conduct, and wished to occupy his place.

During the\r\n      whole expedition, he scarcely allowed himself any moments for\r\n      sleep or food; marching on foot, and in complete armor, at the\r\n      head of his columns, he insinuated himself into the confidence\r\n      and affection of his troops, pressed their diligence, revived\r\n      their spirits, animated their hopes, and was well satisfied to\r\n      share the hardships of the meanest soldier, whilst he kept in\r\n      view the infinite superiority of his reward.\r\n\r\n      31 (return) [ Velleius Paterculus, l. ii. c. 3.

The hasty arrival of every messenger\r\n      increased his just apprehensions. He was successively informed,\r\n      that Severus had passed the Alps; that the Italian cities,\r\n      unwilling or unable to oppose his progress, had received him with\r\n      the warmest professions of joy and duty; that the important place\r\n      of Ravenna had surrendered without resistance, and that the\r\n      Hadriatic fleet was in the hands of the conqueror. The enemy was\r\n      now within two hundred and fifty miles of Rome; and every moment\r\n      diminished the narrow span of life and empire allotted to Julian.\r\n\r\n      He attempted, however, to prevent, or at least to protract, his\r\n      ruin. He implored the venal faith of the Prætorians, filled the\r\n      city with unavailing preparations for war, drew lines round the\r\n      suburbs, and even strengthened the fortifications of the palace;\r\n      as if those last intrenchments could be defended, without hope of\r\n      relief, against a victorious invader. Fear and shame prevented\r\n      the guards from deserting his standard; but they trembled at the\r\n      name of the Pannonian legions, commanded by an experienced\r\n      general, and accustomed to vanquish the barbarians on the frozen\r\n      Danube. 32 They quitted, with a sigh, the pleasures of the baths\r\n      and theatres, to put on arms, whose use they had almost\r\n      forgotten, and beneath the weight of which they were oppressed.\r\n      The unpractised elephants, whose uncouth appearance, it was\r\n      hoped, would strike terror into the army of the north, threw\r\n      their unskilful riders; and the awkward evolutions of the\r\n      marines, drawn from the fleet of Misenum, were an object of\r\n      ridicule to the populace; whilst the senate enjoyed, with secret\r\n      pleasure, the distress and weakness of the usurper. 33\r\n\r\n      32 (return) [ This is not a puerile figure of rhetoric, but an\r\n      allusion to a real fact recorded by Dion, l. lxxi. p. 1181.

See also\r\n      Apulius, Orat. de Magia.—M.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter V: Sale Of The Empire To Didius Julianus.—Part II.\r\n\r\n      Severus, who dreaded neither his arms nor his enchantments,\r\n      guarded himself from the only danger of secret conspiracy, by the\r\n      faithful attendance of six hundred chosen men, who never quitted\r\n      his person or their cuirasses, either by night or by day, during\r\n      the whole march. Advancing with a steady and rapid course, he\r\n      passed, without difficulty, the defiles of the Apennine, received\r\n      into his party the troops and ambassadors sent to retard his\r\n      progress, and made a short halt at Interamnia, about seventy\r\n      miles from Rome. His victory was already secure, but the despair\r\n      of the Prætorians might have rendered it bloody; and Severus had\r\n      the laudable ambition of ascending the throne without drawing the\r\n      sword. 35 His emissaries, dispersed in the capital, assured the\r\n      guards, that provided they would abandon their worthless prince,\r\n      and the perpetrators of the murder of Pertinax, to the justice of\r\n      the conqueror, he would no longer consider that melancholy event\r\n      as the act of the whole body. The faithless Prætorians, whose\r\n      resistance was supported only by sullen obstinacy, gladly\r\n      complied with the easy conditions, seized the greatest part of\r\n      the assassins, and signified to the senate, that they no longer\r\n      defended the cause of Julian. That assembly, convoked by the\r\n      consul, unanimously acknowledged Severus as lawful emperor,\r\n      decreed divine honors to Pertinax, and pronounced a sentence of\r\n      deposition and death against his unfortunate successor. Julian\r\n      was conducted into a private apartment of the baths of the\r\n      palace, and beheaded as a common criminal, after having\r\n      purchased, with an immense treasure, an anxious and precarious\r\n      reign of only sixty-six days. 36 The almost incredible expedition\r\n      of Severus, who, in so short a space of time, conducted a\r\n      numerous army from the banks of the Danube to those of the Tyber,\r\n      proves at once the plenty of provisions produced by agriculture\r\n      and commerce, the goodness of the roads, the discipline of the\r\n      legions, and the indolent, subdued temper of the provinces. 37\r\n\r\n      35 (return) [ Victor and Eutropius, viii. 17, mention a combat\r\n      near the Milvian bridge, the Ponte Molle, unknown to the better\r\n      and more ancient writers.]\r\n\r\n      36 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxiii. p. 1240. Herodian, l. ii. p. 83.\r\n      Hist. August. p. 63.]\r\n\r\n      37 (return) [ From these sixty-six days, we must first deduct\r\n      sixteen, as Pertinax was murdered on the 28th of March, and\r\n      Severus most probably elected on the 13th of April, (see Hist.\r\n      August. p. 65, and Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iii. p.\r\n      393, note 7.) We cannot allow less than ten days after his\r\n      election, to put a numerous army in motion. Forty days remain for\r\n      this rapid march; and as we may compute about eight hundred miles\r\n      from Rome to the neighborhood of Vienna, the army of Severus\r\n      marched twenty miles every day, without halt or intermission.]\r\n\r\n      The first cares of Severus were bestowed on two measures, the one\r\n      dictated by policy, the other by decency; the revenge, and the\r\n      honors, due to the memory of Pertinax. Before the new emperor\r\n      entered Rome, he issued his commands to the Prætorian guards,\r\n      directing them to wait his arrival on a large plain near the\r\n      city, without arms, but in the habits of ceremony, in which they\r\n      were accustomed to attend their sovereign. He was obeyed by those\r\n      haughty troops, whose contrition was the effect of their just\r\n      terrors. A chosen part of the Illyrian army encompassed them with\r\n      levelled spears. Incapable of flight or resistance, they expected\r\n      their fate in silent consternation. Severus mounted the tribunal,\r\n      sternly reproached them with perfidy and cowardice, dismissed\r\n      them with ignominy from the trust which they had betrayed,\r\n      despoiled them of their splendid ornaments, and banished them, on\r\n      pain of death, to the distance of a hundred miles from the\r\n      capital. During the transaction, another detachment had been sent\r\n      to seize their arms, occupy their camp, and prevent the hasty\r\n      consequences of their despair. 38\r\n\r\n      38 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxiv. p. 1241. Herodian, l. ii. p. 84.]\r\n      The funeral and consecration of Pertinax was next solemnized with\r\n      every circumstance of sad magnificence. 39 The senate, with a\r\n      melancholy pleasure, performed the last rites to that excellent\r\n      prince, whom they had loved, and still regretted. The concern of\r\n      his successor was probably less sincere; he esteemed the virtues\r\n      of Pertinax, but those virtues would forever have confined his\r\n      ambition to a private station. Severus pronounced his funeral\r\n      oration with studied eloquence, inward satisfaction, and\r\n      well-acted sorrow; and by this pious regard to his memory,\r\n      convinced the credulous multitude, that _he alone_ was worthy to\r\n      supply his place. Sensible, however, that arms, not ceremonies,\r\n      must assert his claim to the empire, he left Rome at the end of\r\n      thirty days, and without suffering himself to be elated by this\r\n      easy victory, prepared to encounter his more formidable rivals.\r\n\r\n      39 (return) [ Dion, (l. lxxiv. p. 1244,) who assisted at the\r\n      ceremony as a senator, gives a most pompous description of it.]\r\n\r\n      The uncommon abilities and fortune of Severus have induced an\r\n      elegant historian to compare him with the first and greatest of\r\n      the Cæsars. 40 The parallel is, at least, imperfect. Where shall\r\n      we find, in the character of Severus, the commanding superiority\r\n      of soul, the generous clemency, and the various genius, which\r\n      could reconcile and unite the love of pleasure, the thirst of\r\n      knowledge, and the fire of ambition? 41 In one instance only,\r\n      they may be compared, with some degree of propriety, in the\r\n      celerity of their motions, and their civil victories. In less\r\n      than four years, 42 Severus subdued the riches of the East, and\r\n      the valor of the West. He vanquished two competitors of\r\n      reputation and ability, and defeated numerous armies, provided\r\n      with weapons and discipline equal to his own. In that age, the\r\n      art of fortification, and the principles of tactics, were well\r\n      understood by all the Roman generals; and the constant\r\n      superiority of Severus was that of an artist, who uses the same\r\n      instruments with more skill and industry than his rivals. I shall\r\n      not, however, enter into a minute narrative of these military\r\n      operations; but as the two civil wars against Niger and against\r\n      Albinus were almost the same in their conduct, event, and\r\n      consequences, I shall collect into one point of view the most\r\n      striking circumstances, tending to develop the character of the\r\n      conqueror and the state of the empire.\r\n\r\n      40 (return) [ Herodian, l. iii. p. 112]\r\n\r\n      41 (return) [ Though it is not, most assuredly, the intention of\r\n      Lucan to exalt the character of Cæsar, yet the idea he gives of\r\n      that hero, in the tenth book of the Pharsalia, where he describes\r\n      him, at the same time, making love to Cleopatra, sustaining a\r\n      siege against the power of Egypt, and conversing with the sages\r\n      of the country, is, in reality, the noblest panegyric. * Note:\r\n      Lord Byron wrote, no doubt, from a reminiscence of that\r\n      passage—“It is possible to be a very great man, and to be still\r\n      very inferior to Julius Cæsar, the most complete character, so\r\n      Lord Bacon thought, of all antiquity. Nature seems incapable of\r\n      such extraordinary combinations as composed his versatile\r\n      capacity, which was the wonder even of the Romans themselves. The\r\n      first general; the only triumphant politician; inferior to none\r\n      in point of eloquence; comparable to any in the attainments of\r\n      wisdom, in an age made up of the greatest commanders, statesmen,\r\n      orators, and philosophers, that ever appeared in the world; an\r\n      author who composed a perfect specimen of military annals in his\r\n      travelling carriage; at one time in a controversy with Cato, at\r\n      another writing a treatise on punuing, and collecting a set of\r\n      good sayings; fighting and making love at the same moment, and\r\n      willing to abandon both his empire and his mistress for a sight\r\n      of the fountains of the Nile. Such did Julius Cæsar appear to his\r\n      contemporaries, and to those of the subsequent ages who were the\r\n      most inclined to deplore and execrate his fatal genius.” Note 47\r\n      to Canto iv. of Childe Harold.—M.]\r\n\r\n      42 (return) [ Reckoning from his election, April 13, 193, to the\r\n      death of Albinus, February 19, 197. See Tillemont’s Chronology.]\r\n\r\n      Falsehood and insincerity, unsuitable as they seem to the dignity\r\n      of public transactions, offend us with a less degrading idea of\r\n      meanness, than when they are found in the intercourse of private\r\n      life. In the latter, they discover a want of courage; in the\r\n      other, only a defect of power: and, as it is impossible for the\r\n      most able statesmen to subdue millions of followers and enemies\r\n      by their own personal strength, the world, under the name of\r\n      policy, seems to have granted them a very liberal indulgence of\r\n      craft and dissimulation. Yet the arts of Severus cannot be\r\n      justified by the most ample privileges of state reason. He\r\n      promised only to betray, he flattered only to ruin; and however\r\n      he might occasionally bind himself by oaths and treaties, his\r\n      conscience, obsequious to his interest, always released him from\r\n      the inconvenient obligation. 43\r\n\r\n      43 (return) [ Herodian, l. ii. p. 85.]\r\n\r\n      If his two competitors, reconciled by their common danger, had\r\n      advanced upon him without delay, perhaps Severus would have sunk\r\n      under their united effort. Had they even attacked him, at the\r\n      same time, with separate views and separate armies, the contest\r\n      might have been long and doubtful. But they fell, singly and\r\n      successively, an easy prey to the arts as well as arms of their\r\n      subtle enemy, lulled into security by the moderation of his\r\n      professions, and overwhelmed by the rapidity of his action. He\r\n      first marched against Niger, whose reputation and power he the\r\n      most dreaded: but he declined any hostile declarations,\r\n      suppressed the name of his antagonist, and only signified to the\r\n      senate and people his intention of regulating the eastern\r\n      provinces. In private, he spoke of Niger, his old friend and\r\n      intended successor, 44 with the most affectionate regard, and\r\n      highly applauded his generous design of revenging the murder of\r\n      Pertinax. To punish the vile usurper of the throne, was the duty\r\n      of every Roman general. To persevere in arms, and to resist a\r\n      lawful emperor, acknowledged by the senate, would alone render\r\n      him criminal. 45 The sons of Niger had fallen into his hands\r\n      among the children of the provincial governors, detained at Rome\r\n      as pledges for the loyalty of their parents. 46 As long as the\r\n      power of Niger inspired terror, or even respect, they were\r\n      educated with the most tender care, with the children of Severus\r\n      himself; but they were soon involved in their father’s ruin, and\r\n      removed first by exile, and afterwards by death, from the eye of\r\n      public compassion. 47\r\n\r\n      44 (return) [ Whilst Severus was very dangerously ill, it was\r\n      industriously given out, that he intended to appoint Niger and\r\n      Albinus his successors. As he could not be sincere with respect\r\n      to both, he might not be so with regard to either. Yet Severus\r\n      carried his hypocrisy so far, as to profess that intention in the\r\n      memoirs of his own life.]\r\n\r\n      45 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 65.]\r\n\r\n      46 (return) [ This practice, invented by Commodus, proved very\r\n      useful to Severus. He found at Rome the children of many of the\r\n      principal adherents of his rivals; and he employed them more than\r\n      once to intimidate, or seduce, the parents.]\r\n\r\n      47 (return) [ Herodian, l. iii. p. 95. Hist. August. p. 67, 68.]\r\n\r\n      Whilst Severus was engaged in his eastern war, he had reason to\r\n      apprehend that the governor of Britain might pass the sea and the\r\n      Alps, occupy the vacant seat of empire, and oppose his return\r\n      with the authority of the senate and the forces of the West. The\r\n      ambiguous conduct of Albinus, in not assuming the Imperial title,\r\n      left room for negotiation. Forgetting, at once, his professions\r\n      of patriotism, and the jealousy of sovereign power, he accepted\r\n      the precarious rank of Cæsar, as a reward for his fatal\r\n      neutrality. Till the first contest was decided, Severus treated\r\n      the man, whom he had doomed to destruction, with every mark of\r\n      esteem and regard. Even in the letter, in which he announced his\r\n      victory over Niger, he styles Albinus the brother of his soul and\r\n      empire, sends him the affectionate salutations of his wife Julia,\r\n      and his young family, and entreats him to preserve the armies and\r\n      the republic faithful to their common interest. The messengers\r\n      charged with this letter were instructed to accost the Cæsar with\r\n      respect, to desire a private audience, and to plunge their\r\n      daggers into his heart. 48 The conspiracy was discovered, and the\r\n      too credulous Albinus, at length, passed over to the continent,\r\n      and prepared for an unequal contest with his rival, who rushed\r\n      upon him at the head of a veteran and victorious army.\r\n\r\n      48 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 84. Spartianus has inserted this\r\n      curious letter at full length.]\r\n\r\n      The military labors of Severus seem inadequate to the importance\r\n      of his conquests. Two engagements, 481 the one near the\r\n      Hellespont, the other in the narrow defiles of Cilicia, decided\r\n      the fate of his Syrian competitor; and the troops of Europe\r\n      asserted their usual ascendant over the effeminate natives of\r\n      Asia. 49 The battle of Lyons, where one hundred and fifty\r\n      thousand Romans 50 were engaged, was equally fatal to Albinus.\r\n      The valor of the British army maintained, indeed, a sharp and\r\n      doubtful contest, with the hardy discipline of the Illyrian\r\n      legions. The fame and person of Severus appeared, during a few\r\n      moments, irrecoverably lost, till that warlike prince rallied his\r\n      fainting troops, and led them on to a decisive victory. 51 The\r\n      war was finished by that memorable day. 511\r\n\r\n      481 (return) [ There were three actions; one near Cyzicus, on the\r\n      Hellespont, one near Nice, in Bithynia, the third near the Issus,\r\n      in Cilicia, where Alexander conquered Darius.

See Tillemont, tom.\r\n      iii. p. 406, note 18.]\r\n\r\n      511 (return) [ According to Herodian, it was his lieutenant Lætus\r\n      who led back the troops to the battle, and gained the day, which\r\n      Severus had almost lost. Dion also attributes to Lætus a great\r\n      share in the victory. Severus afterwards put him to death, either\r\n      from fear or jealousy.—W. and G. Wenck and M. Guizot have not\r\n      given the real statement of Herodian or of Dion. According to the\r\n      former, Lætus appeared with his own army entire, which he was\r\n      suspected of having designedly kept disengaged when the battle\r\n      was still doudtful, or rather after the rout of severus. Dion\r\n      says that he did not move till Severus had won the victory.—M.]\r\n\r\n      The civil wars of modern Europe have been distinguished, not only\r\n      by the fierce animosity, but likewise by the obstinate\r\n      perseverance, of the contending factions. They have generally\r\n      been justified by some principle, or, at least, colored by some\r\n      pretext, of religion, freedom, or loyalty. The leaders were\r\n      nobles of independent property and hereditary influence. The\r\n      troops fought like men interested in the decision of the quarrel;\r\n      and as military spirit and party zeal were strongly diffused\r\n      throughout the whole community, a vanquished chief was\r\n      immediately supplied with new adherents, eager to shed their\r\n      blood in the same cause. But the Romans, after the fall of the\r\n      republic, combated only for the choice of masters. Under the\r\n      standard of a popular candidate for empire, a few enlisted from\r\n      affection, some from fear, many from interest, none from\r\n      principle. The legions, uninflamed by party zeal, were allured\r\n      into civil war by liberal donatives, and still more liberal\r\n      promises. A defeat, by disabling the chief from the performance\r\n      of his engagements, dissolved the mercenary allegiance of his\r\n      followers, and left them to consult their own safety by a timely\r\n      desertion of an unsuccessful cause. It was of little moment to\r\n      the provinces, under whose name they were oppressed or governed;\r\n      they were driven by the impulsion of the present power, and as\r\n      soon as that power yielded to a superior force, they hastened to\r\n      implore the clemency of the conqueror, who, as he had an immense\r\n      debt to discharge, was obliged to sacrifice the most guilty\r\n      countries to the avarice of his soldiers. In the vast extent of\r\n      the Roman empire, there were few fortified cities capable of\r\n      protecting a routed army; nor was there any person, or family, or\r\n      order of men, whose natural interest, unsupported by the powers\r\n      of government, was capable of restoring the cause of a sinking\r\n      party. 52\r\n\r\n      52 (return) [ Montesquieu, Considerations sur la Grandeur et la\r\n      Decadence des Romains, c. xiii.]\r\n\r\n      Yet, in the contest between Niger and Severus, a single city\r\n      deserves an honorable exception. As Byzantium was one of the\r\n      greatest passages from Europe into Asia, it had been provided\r\n      with a strong garrison, and a fleet of five hundred vessels was\r\n      anchored in the harbor. 53 The impetuosity of Severus\r\n      disappointed this prudent scheme of defence; he left to his\r\n      generals the siege of Byzantium, forced the less guarded passage\r\n      of the Hellespont, and, impatient of a meaner enemy, pressed\r\n      forward to encounter his rival. Byzantium, attacked by a numerous\r\n      and increasing army, and afterwards by the whole naval power of\r\n      the empire, sustained a siege of three years, and remained\r\n      faithful to the name and memory of Niger. The citizens and\r\n      soldiers (we know not from what cause) were animated with equal\r\n      fury; several of the principal officers of Niger, who despaired\r\n      of, or who disdained, a pardon, had thrown themselves into this\r\n      last refuge: the fortifications were esteemed impregnable, and,\r\n      in the defence of the place, a celebrated engineer displayed all\r\n      the mechanic powers known to the ancients. 54 Byzantium, at\r\n      length, surrendered to famine. The magistrates and soldiers were\r\n      put to the sword, the walls demolished, the privileges\r\n      suppressed, and the destined capital of the East subsisted only\r\n      as an open village, subject to the insulting jurisdiction of\r\n      Perinthus. The historian Dion, who had admired the flourishing,\r\n      and lamented the desolate, state of Byzantium, accused the\r\n      revenge of Severus, for depriving the Roman people of the\r\n      strongest bulwark against the barbarians of Pontus and Asia 55\r\n      The truth of this observation was but too well justified in the\r\n      succeeding age, when the Gothic fleets covered the Euxine, and\r\n      passed through the undefined Bosphorus into the centre of the\r\n      Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n      53 (return) [ Most of these, as may be supposed, were small open\r\n      vessels; some, however, were galleys of two, and a few of three\r\n      ranks of oars.]\r\n\r\n      54 (return) [The engineer’s name was Priscus. His skill saved his\r\n      life, and he was taken into the service of the conqueror. For the\r\n      particular facts of the siege, consult Dion Cassius (l. lxxv. p.\r\n      1251) and Herodian, (l. iii. p. 95;) for the theory of it, the\r\n      fanciful chevalier de Folard may be looked into. See Polybe, tom.\r\n      i. p. 76.]\r\n\r\n      55 (return) [ Notwithstanding the authority of Spartianus, and\r\n      some modern Greeks, we may be assured, from Dion and Herodian,\r\n      that Byzantium, many years after the death of Severus, lay in\r\n      ruins. There is no contradiction between the relation of Dion and\r\n      that of Spartianus and the modern Greeks. Dion does not say that\r\n      Severus destroyed Byzantium, but that he deprived it of its\r\n      franchises and privileges, stripped the inhabitants of their\r\n      property, razed the fortifications, and subjected the city to the\r\n      jurisdiction of Perinthus. Therefore, when Spartian, Suidas,\r\n      Cedrenus, say that Severus and his son Antoninus restored to\r\n      Byzantium its rights and franchises, ordered temples to be built,\r\n      &c., this is easily reconciled with the relation of Dion. Perhaps\r\n      the latter mentioned it in some of the fragments of his history\r\n      which have been lost. As to Herodian, his expressions are\r\n      evidently exaggerated, and he has been guilty of so many\r\n      inaccuracies in the history of Severus, that we have a right to\r\n      suppose one in this passage.—G. from W Wenck and M. Guizot have\r\n      omitted to cite Zosimus, who mentions a particular portico built\r\n      by Severus, and called, apparently, by his name. Zosim. Hist. ii.\r\n      c. xxx. p. 151, 153, edit Heyne.—M.]\r\n\r\n      Both Niger and Albinus were discovered and put to death in their\r\n      flight from the field of battle. Their fate excited neither\r\n      surprise nor compassion. They had staked their lives against the\r\n      chance of empire, and suffered what they would have inflicted;\r\n      nor did Severus claim the arrogant superiority of suffering his\r\n      rivals to live in a private station. But his unforgiving temper,\r\n      stimulated by avarice, indulged a spirit of revenge, where there\r\n      was no room for apprehension. The most considerable of the\r\n      provincials, who, without any dislike to the fortunate candidate,\r\n      had obeyed the governor under whose authority they were\r\n      accidentally placed, were punished by death, exile, and\r\n      especially by the confiscation of their estates. Many cities of\r\n      the East were stripped of their ancient honors, and obliged to\r\n      pay, into the treasury of Severus, four times the amount of the\r\n      sums contributed by them for the service of Niger. 56\r\n\r\n      56 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxiv. p. 1250.]\r\n\r\n      Till the final decision of the war, the cruelty of Severus was,\r\n      in some measure, restrained by the uncertainty of the event, and\r\n      his pretended reverence for the senate. The head of Albinus,\r\n      accompanied with a menacing letter, announced to the Romans that\r\n      he was resolved to spare none of the adherents of his unfortunate\r\n      competitors. He was irritated by the just auspicion that he had\r\n      never possessed the affections of the senate, and he concealed\r\n      his old malevolence under the recent discovery of some\r\n      treasonable correspondences. Thirty-five senators, however,\r\n      accused of having favored the party of Albinus, he freely\r\n      pardoned, and, by his subsequent behavior, endeavored to convince\r\n      them, that he had forgotten, as well as forgiven, their supposed\r\n      offences. But, at the same time, he condemned forty-one 57 other\r\n      senators, whose names history has recorded; their wives,\r\n      children, and clients attended them in death, 571 and the noblest\r\n      provincials of Spain and Gaul were involved in the same ruin. 572\r\n      Such rigid justice—for so he termed it—was, in the opinion of\r\n      Severus, the only conduct capable of insuring peace to the people\r\n      or stability to the prince; and he condescended slightly to\r\n      lament, that to be mild, it was necessary that he should first be\r\n      cruel. 58\r\n\r\n      57 (return) [ Dion, (l. lxxv. p. 1264;) only twenty-nine senators\r\n      are mentioned by him, but forty-one are named in the Augustan\r\n      History, p. 69, among whom were six of the name of Pescennius.\r\n      Herodian (l. iii. p. 115) speaks in general of the cruelties of\r\n      Severus.]\r\n\r\n      571 (return) [ Wenck denies that there is any authority for this\r\n      massacre of the wives of the senators.

Their numbers, their wealth, their order, and\r\n      their security, are the best and only foundations of his real\r\n      greatness; and were he totally devoid of virtue, prudence might\r\n      supply its place, and would dictate the same rule of conduct.\r\n      Severus considered the Roman empire as his property, and had no\r\n      sooner secured the possession, than he bestowed his care on the\r\n      cultivation and improvement of so valuable an acquisition.\r\n      Salutary laws, executed with inflexible firmness, soon corrected\r\n      most of the abuses with which, since the death of Marcus, every\r\n      part of the government had been infected. In the administration\r\n      of justice, the judgments of the emperor were characterized by\r\n      attention, discernment, and impartiality; and whenever he\r\n      deviated from the strict line of equity, it was generally in\r\n      favor of the poor and oppressed; not so much indeed from any\r\n      sense of humanity, as from the natural propensity of a despot to\r\n      humble the pride of greatness, and to sink all his subjects to\r\n      the same common level of absolute dependence. His expensive taste\r\n      for building, magnificent shows, and above all a constant and\r\n      liberal distribution of corn and provisions, were the surest\r\n      means of captivating the affection of the Roman people. 59 The\r\n      misfortunes of civil discord were obliterated. The calm of peace\r\n      and prosperity was once more experienced in the provinces; and\r\n      many cities, restored by the munificence of Severus, assumed the\r\n      title of his colonies, and attested by public monuments their\r\n      gratitude and felicity. 60 The fame of the Roman arms was revived\r\n      by that warlike and successful emperor, 61 and he boasted, with a\r\n      just pride, that, having received the empire oppressed with\r\n      foreign and domestic wars, he left it established in profound,\r\n      universal, and honorable peace. 62\r\n\r\n      59 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxvi. p. 1272.

By gratitude, by misguided\r\n      policy, by seeming necessity, Severus was reduced to relax the\r\n      nerves of discipline. 63 The vanity of his soldiers was flattered\r\n      with the honor of wearing gold rings; their ease was indulged in\r\n      the permission of living with their wives in the idleness of\r\n      quarters. He increased their pay beyond the example of former\r\n      times, and taught them to expect, and soon to claim,\r\n      extraordinary donatives on every public occasion of danger or\r\n      festivity. Elated by success, enervated by luxury, and raised\r\n      above the level of subjects by their dangerous privileges, 64\r\n      they soon became incapable of military fatigue, oppressive to the\r\n      country, and impatient of a just subordination. Their officers\r\n      asserted the superiority of rank by a more profuse and elegant\r\n      luxury. There is still extant a letter of Severus, lamenting the\r\n      licentious stage of the army, 641 and exhorting one of his\r\n      generals to begin the necessary reformation from the tribunes\r\n      themselves; since, as he justly observes, the officer who has\r\n      forfeited the esteem, will never command the obedience, of his\r\n      soldiers. 65 Had the emperor pursued the train of reflection, he\r\n      would have discovered, that the primary cause of this general\r\n      corruption might be ascribed, not indeed to the example, but to\r\n      the pernicious indulgence, however, of the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\n      63 (return) [ Herodian, l. iii. p. 115.

In the room of these elegant troops, better\r\n      adapted to the pomp of courts than to the uses of war, it was\r\n      established by Severus, that from all the legions of the\r\n      frontiers, the soldiers most distinguished for strength, valor,\r\n      and fidelity, should be occasionally draughted; and promoted, as\r\n      an honor and reward, into the more eligible service of the\r\n      guards. 67 By this new institution, the Italian youth were\r\n      diverted from the exercise of arms, and the capital was terrified\r\n      by the strange aspect and manners of a multitude of barbarians.\r\n      But Severus flattered himself, that the legions would consider\r\n      these chosen Prætorians as the representatives of the whole\r\n      military order; and that the present aid of fifty thousand men,\r\n      superior in arms and appointments to any force that could be\r\n      brought into the field against them, would forever crush the\r\n      hopes of rebellion, and secure the empire to himself and his\r\n      posterity.\r\n\r\n      66 (return) [ Herodian, l. iii. p. 131.]\r\n\r\n      67 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxiv. p. 1243.]\r\n\r\n      The command of these favored and formidable troops soon became\r\n      the first office of the empire. As the government degenerated\r\n      into military despotism, the Prætorian Præfect, who in his origin\r\n      had been a simple captain of the guards, 671 was placed not only\r\n      at the head of the army, but of the finances, and even of the\r\n      law. In every department of administration, he represented the\r\n      person, and exercised the authority, of the emperor. The first\r\n      præfect who enjoyed and abused this immense power was Plautianus,\r\n      the favorite minister of Severus. His reign lasted above ten\r\n      years, till the marriage of his daughter with the eldest son of\r\n      the emperor, which seemed to assure his fortune, proved the\r\n      occasion of his ruin. 68 The animosities of the palace, by\r\n      irritating the ambition and alarming the fears of Plautianus, 681\r\n      threatened to produce a revolution, and obliged the emperor, who\r\n      still loved him, to consent with reluctance to his death. 69\r\n      After the fall of Plautianus, an eminent lawyer, the celebrated\r\n      Papinian, was appointed to execute the motley office of Prætorian\r\n      Præfect.\r\n\r\n      671 (return) [ The Prætorian Præfect had never been a simple\r\n      captain of the guards; from the first creation of this office,\r\n      under Augustus, it possessed great power.

But the youth of\r\n      Severus had been trained in the implicit obedience of camps, and\r\n      his riper years spent in the despotism of military command. His\r\n      haughty and inflexible spirit could not discover, or would not\r\n      acknowledge, the advantage of preserving an intermediate power,\r\n      however imaginary, between the emperor and the army. He disdained\r\n      to profess himself the servant of an assembly that detested his\r\n      person and trembled at his frown; he issued his commands, where\r\n      his requests would have proved as effectual; assumed the conduct\r\n      and style of a sovereign and a conqueror, and exercised, without\r\n      disguise, the whole legislative, as well as the executive power.\r\n\r\n      The victory over the senate was easy and inglorious. Every eye\r\n      and every passion were directed to the supreme magistrate, who\r\n      possessed the arms and treasure of the state; whilst the senate,\r\n      neither elected by the people, nor guarded by military force, nor\r\n      animated by public spirit, rested its declining authority on the\r\n      frail and crumbling basis of ancient opinion. The fine theory of\r\n      a republic insensibly vanished, and made way for the more natural\r\n      and substantial feelings of monarchy. As the freedom and honors\r\n      of Rome were successively communicated to the provinces, in which\r\n      the old government had been either unknown, or was remembered\r\n      with abhorrence, the tradition of republican maxims was gradually\r\n      obliterated. The Greek historians of the age of the Antonines 70\r\n      observe, with a malicious pleasure, that although the sovereign\r\n      of Rome, in compliance with an obsolete prejudice, abstained from\r\n      the name of king, he possessed the full measure of regal power.\r\n      In the reign of Severus, the senate was filled with polished and\r\n      eloquent slaves from the eastern provinces, who justified\r\n      personal flattery by speculative principles of servitude. These\r\n      new advocates of prerogative were heard with pleasure by the\r\n      court, and with patience by the people, when they inculcated the\r\n      duty of passive obedience, and descanted on the inevitable\r\n      mischiefs of freedom. The lawyers and historians concurred in\r\n      teaching, that the Imperial authority was held, not by the\r\n      delegated commission, but by the irrevocable resignation of the\r\n      senate; that the emperor was freed from the restraint of civil\r\n      laws, could command by his arbitrary will the lives and fortunes\r\n      of his subjects, and might dispose of the empire as of his\r\n      private patrimony. 71 The most eminent of the civil lawyers, and\r\n      particularly Papinian, Paulus, and Ulpian, flourished under the\r\n      house of Severus; and the Roman jurisprudence, having closely\r\n      united itself with the system of monarchy, was supposed to have\r\n      attained its full majority and perfection.\r\n\r\n      70 (return) [ Appian in Proœm.]\r\n\r\n      71 (return) [ Dion Cassius seems to have written with no other\r\n      view than to form these opinions into an historical system.

This\r\n      melancholy truth was felt and acknowledged by Severus. Fortune\r\n      and merit had, from an humble station, elevated him to the first\r\n      place among mankind. “He had been all things,” as he said\r\n      himself, “and all was of little value.” 1 Distracted with the\r\n      care, not of acquiring, but of preserving an empire, oppressed\r\n      with age and infirmities, careless of fame, 2 and satiated with\r\n      power, all his prospects of life were closed. The desire of\r\n      perpetuating the greatness of his family was the only remaining\r\n      wish of his ambition and paternal tenderness.\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ Hist.

He had lost his first wife, while he was governor of the\r\n      Lionnese Gaul. 3 In the choice of a second, he sought only to\r\n      connect himself with some favorite of fortune; and as soon as he\r\n      had discovered that the young lady of Emesa in Syria had _a royal\r\n      nativity_, he solicited and obtained her hand. 4 Julia Domna (for\r\n      that was her name) deserved all that the stars could promise her.\r\n\r\n      She possessed, even in advanced age, the attractions of beauty, 5\r\n      and united to a lively imagination a firmness of mind, and\r\n      strength of judgment, seldom bestowed on her sex. Her amiable\r\n      qualities never made any deep impression on the dark and jealous\r\n      temper of her husband; but in her son’s reign, she administered\r\n      the principal affairs of the empire, with a prudence that\r\n      supported his authority, and with a moderation that sometimes\r\n      corrected his wild extravagancies. 6 Julia applied herself to\r\n      letters and philosophy, with some success, and with the most\r\n      splendid reputation. She was the patroness of every art, and the\r\n      friend of every man of genius. 7 The grateful flattery of the\r\n      learned has celebrated her virtues; but, if we may credit the\r\n      scandal of ancient history, chastity was very far from being the\r\n      most conspicuous virtue of the empress Julia. 8\r\n\r\n      3 (return) [ About the year 186.

During his reign, he assumed the\r\n      appellation of Antoninus, which is employed by lawyers and\r\n      ancient historians. After his death, the public indignation\r\n      loaded him with the nicknames of Tarantus and Caracalla. The\r\n      first was borrowed from a celebrated Gladiator, the second from a\r\n      long Gallic gown which he distributed to the people of Rome.]\r\n\r\n      Their aversion, confirmed by years, and fomented by the arts of\r\n      their interested favorites, broke out in childish, and gradually\r\n      in more serious competitions; and, at length, divided the\r\n      theatre, the circus, and the court, into two factions, actuated\r\n      by the hopes and fears of their respective leaders. The prudent\r\n      emperor endeavored, by every expedient of advice and authority,\r\n      to allay this growing animosity. The unhappy discord of his sons\r\n      clouded all his prospects, and threatened to overturn a throne\r\n      raised with so much labor, cemented with so much blood, and\r\n      guarded with every defence of arms and treasure. With an\r\n      impartial hand he maintained between them an exact balance of\r\n      favor, conferred on both the rank of Augustus, with the revered\r\n      name of Antoninus; and for the first time the Roman world beheld\r\n      three emperors. 10 Yet even this equal conduct served only to\r\n      inflame the contest, whilst the fierce Caracalla asserted the\r\n      right of primogeniture, and the milder Geta courted the\r\n      affections of the people and the soldiers. In the anguish of a\r\n      disappointed father, Severus foretold that the weaker of his sons\r\n      would fall a sacrifice to the stronger; who, in his turn, would\r\n      be ruined by his own vices. 11\r\n\r\n      10 (return) [ The elevation of Caracalla is fixed by the accurate\r\n      M. de Tillemont to the year 198; the association of Geta to the\r\n      year 208.]\r\n\r\n      11 (return) [ Herodian, l. iii. p. 130. The lives of Caracalla\r\n      and Geta, in the Augustan History.]\r\n\r\n      In these circumstances the intelligence of a war in Britain, and\r\n      of an invasion of the province by the barbarians of the North,\r\n      was received with pleasure by Severus. Though the vigilance of\r\n      his lieutenants might have been sufficient to repel the distant\r\n      enemy, he resolved to embrace the honorable pretext of\r\n      withdrawing his sons from the luxury of Rome, which enervated\r\n      their minds and irritated their passions; and of inuring their\r\n      youth to the toils of war and government. Notwithstanding his\r\n      advanced age, (for he was above threescore,) and his gout, which\r\n      obliged him to be carried in a litter, he transported himself in\r\n      person into that remote island, attended by his two sons, his\r\n      whole court, and a formidable army. He immediately passed the\r\n      walls of Hadrian and Antoninus, and entered the enemy’s country,\r\n      with a design of completing the long attempted conquest of\r\n      Britain. He penetrated to the northern extremity of the island,\r\n      without meeting an enemy. But the concealed ambuscades of the\r\n      Caledonians, who hung unseen on the rear and flanks of his army,\r\n      the coldness of the climate and the severity of a winter march\r\n      across the hills and morasses of Scotland, are reported to have\r\n      cost the Romans above fifty thousand men. The Caledonians at\r\n      length yielded to the powerful and obstinate attack, sued for\r\n      peace, and surrendered a part of their arms, and a large tract of\r\n      territory. But their apparent submission lasted no longer than\r\n      the present terror. As soon as the Roman legions had retired,\r\n      they resumed their hostile independence. Their restless spirit\r\n      provoked Severus to send a new army into Caledonia, with the most\r\n      bloody orders, not to subdue, but to extirpate the natives. They\r\n      were saved by the death of their haughty enemy. 12\r\n\r\n      12 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxvi. p. 1280, &c. Herodian, l. iii. p.\r\n      132, &c.]\r\n\r\n      This Caledonian war, neither marked by decisive events, nor\r\n      attended with any important consequences, would ill deserve our\r\n      attention; but it is supposed, not without a considerable degree\r\n      of probability, that the invasion of Severus is connected with\r\n      the most shining period of the British history or fable. Fingal,\r\n      whose fame, with that of his heroes and bards, has been revived\r\n      in our language by a recent publication, is said to have\r\n      commanded the Caledonians in that memorable juncture, to have\r\n      eluded the power of Severus, and to have obtained a signal\r\n      victory on the banks of the Carun, in which the son of _the King\r\n      of the World_, Caracul, fled from his arms along the fields of\r\n      his pride. 13 Something of a doubtful mist still hangs over these\r\n      Highland traditions; nor can it be entirely dispelled by the most\r\n      ingenious researches of modern criticism; 14 but if we could,\r\n      with safety, indulge the pleasing supposition, that Fingal lived,\r\n      and that Ossian sung, the striking contrast of the situation and\r\n      manners of the contending nations might amuse a philosophic mind.\r\n\r\n      The parallel would be little to the advantage of the more\r\n      civilized people, if we compared the unrelenting revenge of\r\n      Severus with the generous clemency of Fingal; the timid and\r\n      brutal cruelty of Caracalla with the bravery, the tenderness, the\r\n      elegant genius of Ossian; the mercenary chiefs, who, from motives\r\n      of fear or interest, served under the imperial standard, with the\r\n      free-born warriors who started to arms at the voice of the king\r\n      of Morven; if, in a word, we contemplated the untutored\r\n      Caledonians, glowing with the warm virtues of nature, and the\r\n      degenerate Romans, polluted with the mean vices of wealth and\r\n      slavery.\r\n\r\n      13 (return) [ Ossian’s Poems, vol. i. p. 175.]\r\n\r\n      14 (return) [ That the Caracul of Ossian is the Caracalla of the\r\n      Roman History, is, perhaps, the only point of British antiquity\r\n      in which Mr. Macpherson and Mr. Whitaker are of the same opinion;\r\n      and yet the opinion is not without difficulty. In the Caledonian\r\n      war, the son of Severus was known only by the appellation of\r\n      Antoninus, and it may seem strange that the Highland bard should\r\n      describe him by a nickname, invented four years afterwards,\r\n      scarcely used by the Romans till after the death of that emperor,\r\n      and seldom employed by the most ancient historians. See Dion, l.\r\n      lxxvii. p. 1317. Hist. August. p. 89 Aurel. Victor. Euseb. in\r\n      Chron. ad ann. 214. Note: The historical authority of\r\n      Macpherson’s Ossian has not increased since Gibbon wrote. We may,\r\n      indeed, consider it exploded. Mr. Whitaker, in a letter to Gibbon\r\n      (Misc. Works, vol. ii. p. 100,) attempts, not very successfully,\r\n      to weaken this objection of the historian.—M.]\r\n\r\n      The declining health and last illness of Severus inflamed the\r\n      wild ambition and black passions of Caracalla’s soul. Impatient\r\n      of any delay or division of empire, he attempted, more than once,\r\n      to shorten the small remainder of his father’s days, and\r\n      endeavored, but without success, to excite a mutiny among the\r\n      troops. 15 The old emperor had often censured the misguided\r\n      lenity of Marcus, who, by a single act of justice, might have\r\n      saved the Romans from the tyranny of his worthless son. Placed in\r\n      the same situation, he experienced how easily the rigor of a\r\n      judge dissolves away in the tenderness of a parent. He\r\n      deliberated, he threatened, but he could not punish; and this\r\n      last and only instance of mercy was more fatal to the empire than\r\n      a long series of cruelty. 16 The disorder of his mind irritated\r\n      the pains of his body; he wished impatiently for death, and\r\n      hastened the instant of it by his impatience. He expired at York\r\n      in the sixty-fifth year of his life, and in the eighteenth of a\r\n      glorious and successful reign. In his last moments he recommended\r\n      concord to his sons, and his sons to the army. The salutary\r\n      advice never reached the heart, or even the understanding, of the\r\n      impetuous youths; but the more obedient troops, mindful of their\r\n      oath of allegiance, and of the authority of their deceased\r\n      master, resisted the solicitations of Caracalla, and proclaimed\r\n      both brothers emperors of Rome. The new princes soon left the\r\n      Caledonians in peace, returned to the capital, celebrated their\r\n      father’s funeral with divine honors, and were cheerfully\r\n      acknowledged as lawful sovereigns, by the senate, the people, and\r\n      the provinces. Some preeminence of rank seems to have been\r\n      allowed to the elder brother; but they both administered the\r\n      empire with equal and independent power. 17\r\n\r\n      15 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxvi. p. 1282.

Herodian, l.\r\n      iii. p. 135.]\r\n\r\n      Such a divided form of government would have proved a source of\r\n      discord between the most affectionate brothers. It was impossible\r\n      that it could long subsist between two implacable enemies, who\r\n      neither desired nor could trust a reconciliation. It was visible\r\n      that one only could reign, and that the other must fall; and each\r\n      of them, judging of his rival’s designs by his own, guarded his\r\n      life with the most jealous vigilance from the repeated attacks of\r\n      poison or the sword. Their rapid journey through Gaul and Italy,\r\n      during which they never ate at the same table, or slept in the\r\n      same house, displayed to the provinces the odious spectacle of\r\n      fraternal discord. On their arrival at Rome, they immediately\r\n      divided the vast extent of the imperial palace. 18 No\r\n      communication was allowed between their apartments; the doors and\r\n      passages were diligently fortified, and guards posted and\r\n      relieved with the same strictness as in a besieged place. The\r\n      emperors met only in public, in the presence of their afflicted\r\n      mother; and each surrounded by a numerous train of armed\r\n      followers. Even on these occasions of ceremony, the dissimulation\r\n      of courts could ill disguise the rancor of their hearts. 19\r\n\r\n      18 (return) [ Mr. Hume is justly surprised at a passage of\r\n      Herodian, (l. iv. p. 139,) who, on this occasion, represents the\r\n      Imperial palace as equal in extent to the rest of Rome. The whole\r\n      region of the Palatine Mount, on which it was built, occupied, at\r\n      most, a circumference of eleven or twelve thousand feet, (see the\r\n      Notitia and Victor, in Nardini’s Roma Antica.) But we should\r\n      recollect that the opulent senators had almost surrounded the\r\n      city with their extensive gardens and suburb palaces, the\r\n      greatest part of which had been gradually confiscated by the\r\n      emperors. If Geta resided in the gardens that bore his name on\r\n      the Janiculum, and if Caracalla inhabited the gardens of Mæcenas\r\n      on the Esquiline, the rival brothers were separated from each\r\n      other by the distance of several miles; and yet the intermediate\r\n      space was filled by the Imperial gardens of Sallust, of Lucullus,\r\n      of Agrippa, of Domitian, of Caius, &c., all skirting round the\r\n      city, and all connected with each other, and with the palace, by\r\n      bridges thrown over the Tiber and the streets. But this\r\n      explanation of Herodian would require, though it ill deserves, a\r\n      particular dissertation, illustrated by a map of ancient Rome.\r\n      (Hume, Essay on Populousness of Ancient Nations.—M.)]\r\n\r\n      19 (return) [ Herodian, l. iv. p. 139]\r\n\r\n      This latent civil war already distracted the whole government,\r\n      when a scheme was suggested that seemed of mutual benefit to the\r\n      hostile brothers. It was proposed, that since it was impossible\r\n      to reconcile their minds, they should separate their interest,\r\n      and divide the empire between them. The conditions of the treaty\r\n      were already drawn with some accuracy. It was agreed that\r\n      Caracalla, as the elder brother should remain in possession of\r\n      Europe and the western Africa; and that he should relinquish the\r\n      sovereignty of Asia and Egypt to Geta, who might fix his\r\n      residence at Alexandria or Antioch, cities little inferior to\r\n      Rome itself in wealth and greatness; that numerous armies should\r\n      be constantly encamped on either side of the Thracian Bosphorus,\r\n      to guard the frontiers of the rival monarchies; and that the\r\n      senators of European extraction should acknowledge the sovereign\r\n      of Rome, whilst the natives of Asia followed the emperor of the\r\n      East. The tears of the empress Julia interrupted the negotiation,\r\n      the first idea of which had filled every Roman breast with\r\n      surprise and indignation. The mighty mass of conquest was so\r\n      intimately united by the hand of time and policy, that it\r\n      required the most forcible violence to rend it asunder. The\r\n      Romans had reason to dread, that the disjointed members would\r\n      soon be reduced by a civil war under the dominion of one master;\r\n      but if the separation was permanent, the division of the\r\n      provinces must terminate in the dissolution of an empire whose\r\n      unity had hitherto remained inviolate. 20\r\n\r\n      20 (return) [ Herodian, l. iv. p. 144.]\r\n\r\n      Had the treaty been carried into execution, the sovereign of\r\n      Europe might soon have been the conqueror of Asia; but Caracalla\r\n      obtained an easier, though a more guilty, victory. He artfully\r\n      listened to his mother’s entreaties, and consented to meet his\r\n      brother in her apartment, on terms of peace and reconciliation.\r\n      In the midst of their conversation, some centurions, who had\r\n      contrived to conceal themselves, rushed with drawn swords upon\r\n      the unfortunate Geta. His distracted mother strove to protect him\r\n      in her arms; but, in the unavailing struggle, she was wounded in\r\n      the hand, and covered with the blood of her younger son, while\r\n      she saw the elder animating and assisting 21 the fury of the\r\n      assassins. As soon as the deed was perpetrated, Caracalla, with\r\n      hasty steps, and horror in his countenance, ran towards the\r\n      Prætorian camp, as his only refuge, and threw himself on the\r\n      ground before the statues of the tutelar deities. 22 The soldiers\r\n      attempted to raise and comfort him. In broken and disordered\r\n      words he informed them of his imminent danger, and fortunate\r\n      escape; insinuating that he had prevented the designs of his\r\n      enemy, and declared his resolution to live and die with his\r\n      faithful troops. Geta had been the favorite of the soldiers; but\r\n      complaint was useless, revenge was dangerous, and they still\r\n      reverenced the son of Severus. Their discontent died away in idle\r\n      murmurs, and Caracalla soon convinced them of the justice of his\r\n      cause, by distributing in one lavish donative the accumulated\r\n      treasures of his father’s reign. 23 The real _sentiments_ of the\r\n      soldiers alone were of importance to his power or safety. Their\r\n      declaration in his favor commanded the dutiful _professions_ of\r\n      the senate. The obsequious assembly was always prepared to ratify\r\n      the decision of fortune; 231 but as Caracalla wished to assuage\r\n      the first emotions of public indignation, the name of Geta was\r\n      mentioned with decency, and he received the funeral honors of a\r\n      Roman emperor. 24 Posterity, in pity to his misfortune, has cast\r\n      a veil over his vices. We consider that young prince as the\r\n      innocent victim of his brother’s ambition, without recollecting\r\n      that he himself wanted power, rather than inclination, to\r\n      consummate the same attempts of revenge and murder. 241\r\n\r\n      21 (return) [ Caracalla consecrated, in the temple of Serapis,\r\n      the sword with which, as he boasted, he had slain his brother\r\n      Geta.

Neither business, nor pleasure,\r\n      nor flattery, could defend Caracalla from the stings of a guilty\r\n      conscience; and he confessed, in the anguish of a tortured mind,\r\n      that his disordered fancy often beheld the angry forms of his\r\n      father and his brother rising into life, to threaten and upbraid\r\n      him. 25 The consciousness of his crime should have induced him to\r\n      convince mankind, by the virtues of his reign, that the bloody\r\n      deed had been the involuntary effect of fatal necessity. But the\r\n      repentance of Caracalla only prompted him to remove from the\r\n      world whatever could remind him of his guilt, or recall the\r\n      memory of his murdered brother. On his return from the senate to\r\n      the palace, he found his mother in the company of several noble\r\n      matrons, weeping over the untimely fate of her younger son. The\r\n      jealous emperor threatened them with instant death; the sentence\r\n      was executed against Fadilla, the last remaining daughter of the\r\n      emperor Marcus; 251 and even the afflicted Julia was obliged to\r\n      silence her lamentations, to suppress her sighs, and to receive\r\n      the assassin with smiles of joy and approbation. It was computed\r\n      that, under the vague appellation of the friends of Geta, above\r\n      twenty thousand persons of both sexes suffered death. His guards\r\n      and freedmen, the ministers of his serious business, and the\r\n      companions of his looser hours, those who by his interest had\r\n      been promoted to any commands in the army or provinces, with the\r\n      long connected chain of their dependants, were included in the\r\n      proscription; which endeavored to reach every one who had\r\n      maintained the smallest correspondence with Geta, who lamented\r\n      his death, or who even mentioned his name. 26 Helvius Pertinax,\r\n      son to the prince of that name, lost his life by an unseasonable\r\n      witticism. 27 It was a sufficient crime of Thrasea Priscus to be\r\n      descended from a family in which the love of liberty seemed an\r\n      hereditary quality. 28 The particular causes of calumny and\r\n      suspicion were at length exhausted; and when a senator was\r\n      accused of being a secret enemy to the government, the emperor\r\n      was satisfied with the general proof that he was a man of\r\n      property and virtue. From this well-grounded principle he\r\n      frequently drew the most bloody inferences. 281\r\n\r\n      25 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxvii. p. 1307]\r\n\r\n      251 (return) [ The most valuable paragraph of dion, which the\r\n      industry of M.

The death of\r\n      Papinian, the Prætorian Præfect, was lamented as a public\r\n      calamity. 282 During the last seven years of Severus, he had\r\n      exercised the most important offices of the state, and, by his\r\n      salutary influence, guided the emperor’s steps in the paths of\r\n      justice and moderation. In full assurance of his virtue and\r\n      abilities, Severus, on his death-bed, had conjured him to watch\r\n      over the prosperity and union of the Imperial family. 29 The\r\n      honest labors of Papinian served only to inflame the hatred which\r\n      Caracalla had already conceived against his father’s minister.\r\n      After the murder of Geta, the Præfect was commanded to exert the\r\n      powers of his skill and eloquence in a studied apology for that\r\n      atrocious deed. The philosophic Seneca had condescended to\r\n      compose a similar epistle to the senate, in the name of the son\r\n      and assassin of Agrippina. 30 “That it was easier to commit than\r\n      to justify a parricide,” was the glorious reply of Papinian; 31\r\n      who did not hesitate between the loss of life and that of honor.\r\n      Such intrepid virtue, which had escaped pure and unsullied from\r\n      the intrigues of courts, the habits of business, and the arts of\r\n      his profession, reflects more lustre on the memory of Papinian,\r\n      than all his great employments, his numerous writings, and the\r\n      superior reputation as a lawyer, which he has preserved through\r\n      every age of the Roman jurisprudence. 32\r\n\r\n      282 (return) [ Papinian was no longer Prætorian Præfect.\r\n      Caracalla had deprived him of that office immediately after the\r\n      death of Severus.

Augustus, Trajan,\r\n      Hadrian, and Marcus visited their extensive dominions in person,\r\n      and their progress was marked by acts of wisdom and beneficence.\r\n      The tyranny of Tiberius, Nero, and Domitian, who resided almost\r\n      constantly at Rome, or in the adjacent was confined to the\r\n      senatorial and equestrian orders. 33 But Caracalla was the common\r\n      enemy of mankind. He left the capital (and he never returned to\r\n      it) about a year after the murder of Geta. The rest of his reign\r\n      was spent in the several provinces of the empire, particularly\r\n      those of the East, and every province was by turns the scene of\r\n      his rapine and cruelty. The senators, compelled by fear to attend\r\n      his capricious motions, were obliged to provide daily\r\n      entertainments at an immense expense, which he abandoned with\r\n      contempt to his guards; and to erect, in every city, magnificent\r\n      palaces and theatres, which he either disdained to visit, or\r\n      ordered immediately thrown down. The most wealthy families were\r\n      ruined by partial fines and confiscations, and the great body of\r\n      his subjects oppressed by ingenious and aggravated taxes. 34 In\r\n      the midst of peace, and upon the slightest provocation, he issued\r\n      his commands, at Alexandria, in Egypt for a general massacre.\r\n      From a secure post in the temple of Serapis, he viewed and\r\n      directed the slaughter of many thousand citizens, as well as\r\n      strangers, without distinguishing the number or the crime of the\r\n      sufferers; since as he coolly informed the senate, _all_ the\r\n      Alexandrians, those who had perished, and those who had escaped,\r\n      were alike guilty. 35\r\n\r\n      33 (return) [ Tiberius and Domitian never moved from the\r\n      neighborhood of Rome.

It seems probable that the Alexandrians has\r\n      irritated the tyrant by their railleries, and perhaps by their\r\n      tumults. * Note: After these massacres, Caracalla also deprived\r\n      the Alexandrians of their spectacles and public feasts; he\r\n      divided the city into two parts by a wall with towers at\r\n      intervals, to prevent the peaceful communications of the\r\n      citizens. Thus was treated the unhappy Alexandria, says Dion, by\r\n      the savage beast of Ausonia. This, in fact, was the epithet which\r\n      the oracle had applied to him; it is said, indeed, that he was\r\n      much pleased with the name and often boasted of it. Dion, lxxvii.\r\n      p. 1307.—G.]\r\n\r\n      The wise instructions of Severus never made any lasting\r\n      impression on the mind of his son, who, although not destitute of\r\n      imagination and eloquence, was equally devoid of judgment and\r\n      humanity. 36 One dangerous maxim, worthy of a tyrant, was\r\n      remembered and abused by Caracalla. “To secure the affections of\r\n      the army, and to esteem the rest of his subjects as of little\r\n      moment.” 37 But the liberality of the father had been restrained\r\n      by prudence, and his indulgence to the troops was tempered by\r\n      firmness and authority. The careless profusion of the son was the\r\n      policy of one reign, and the inevitable ruin both of the army and\r\n      of the empire. The vigor of the soldiers, instead of being\r\n      confirmed by the severe discipline of camps, melted away in the\r\n      luxury of cities. The excessive increase of their pay and\r\n      donatives 38 exhausted the state to enrich the military order,\r\n      whose modesty in peace, and service in war, is best secured by an\r\n      honorable poverty. The demeanor of Caracalla was haughty and full\r\n      of pride; but with the troops he forgot even the proper dignity\r\n      of his rank, encouraged their insolent familiarity, and,\r\n      neglecting the essential duties of a general, affected to imitate\r\n      the dress and manners of a common soldier.\r\n\r\n      36 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxvii. p. 1296.]\r\n\r\n      37 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxvi. p. 1284. Mr. Wotton (Hist. of Rome,\r\n      p. 330) suspects that this maxim was invented by Caracalla\r\n      himself, and attributed to his father.]\r\n\r\n      38 (return) [ Dion (l. lxxviii. p. 1343) informs us that the\r\n      extraordinary gifts of Caracalla to the army amounted annually to\r\n      seventy millions of drachmæ (about two millions three hundred and\r\n      fifty thousand pounds.) There is another passage in Dion,\r\n      concerning the military pay, infinitely curious, were it not\r\n      obscure, imperfect, and probably corrupt. The best sense seems to\r\n      be, that the Prætorian guards received twelve hundred and fifty\r\n      drachmæ, (forty pounds a year,) (Dion, l. lxxvii. p. 1307.) Under\r\n      the reign of Augustus, they were paid at the rate of two drachmæ,\r\n      or denarii, per day, 720 a year, (Tacit. Annal. i. 17.) Domitian,\r\n      who increased the soldiers’ pay one fourth, must have raised the\r\n      Prætorians to 960 drachmæ, (Gronoviue de Pecunia Veteri, l. iii.\r\n      c. 2.) These successive augmentations ruined the empire; for,\r\n      with the soldiers’ pay, their numbers too were increased. We have\r\n      seen the Prætorians alone increased from 10,000 to 50,000 men.\r\n      Note: Valois and Reimar have explained in a very simple and\r\n      probable manner this passage of Dion, which Gibbon seems to me\r\n      not to have understood. He ordered that the soldiers should\r\n      receive, as the reward of their services the Prætorians 1250\r\n      drachms, the other 5000 drachms. Valois thinks that the numbers\r\n      have been transposed, and that Caracalla added 5000 drachms to\r\n      the donations made to the Prætorians, 1250 to those of the\r\n      legionaries. The Prætorians, in fact, always received more than\r\n      the others. The error of Gibbon arose from his considering that\r\n      this referred to the annual pay of the soldiers, while it relates\r\n      to the sum they received as a reward for their services on their\r\n      discharge: donatives means recompense for service. Augustus had\r\n      settled that the Prætorians, after sixteen campaigns, should\r\n      receive 5000 drachms: the legionaries received only 3000 after\r\n      twenty years. Caracalla added 5000 drachms to the donative of the\r\n      Prætorians, 1250 to that of the legionaries. Gibbon appears to\r\n      have been mistaken both in confounding this donative on discharge\r\n      with the annual pay, and in not paying attention to the remark of\r\n      Valois on the transposition of the numbers in the text.—G]\r\n\r\n      It was impossible that such a character, and such conduct as that\r\n      of Caracalla, could inspire either love or esteem; but as long as\r\n      his vices were beneficial to the armies, he was secure from the\r\n      danger of rebellion. A secret conspiracy, provoked by his own\r\n      jealousy, was fatal to the tyrant. The Prætorian præfecture was\r\n      divided between two ministers. The military department was\r\n      intrusted to Adventus, an experienced rather than able soldier;\r\n      and the civil affairs were transacted by Opilius Macrinus, who,\r\n      by his dexterity in business, had raised himself, with a fair\r\n      character, to that high office. But his favor varied with the\r\n      caprice of the emperor, and his life might depend on the\r\n      slightest suspicion, or the most casual circumstance. Malice or\r\n      fanaticism had suggested to an African, deeply skilled in the\r\n      knowledge of futurity, a very dangerous prediction, that Macrinus\r\n      and his son were destined to reign over the empire. The report\r\n      was soon diffused through the province; and when the man was sent\r\n      in chains to Rome, he still asserted, in the presence of the\r\n      præfect of the city, the faith of his prophecy. That magistrate,\r\n      who had received the most pressing instructions to inform himself\r\n      of the _successors_ of Caracalla, immediately communicated the\r\n      examination of the African to the Imperial court, which at that\r\n      time resided in Syria. But, notwithstanding the diligence of the\r\n      public messengers, a friend of Macrinus found means to apprise\r\n      him of the approaching danger. The emperor received the letters\r\n      from Rome; and as he was then engaged in the conduct of a chariot\r\n      race, he delivered them unopened to the Prætorian Præfect,\r\n      directing him to despatch the ordinary affairs, and to report the\r\n      more important business that might be contained in them. Macrinus\r\n      read his fate, and resolved to prevent it. He inflamed the\r\n      discontents of some inferior officers, and employed the hand of\r\n      Martialis, a desperate soldier, who had been refused the rank of\r\n      centurion. The devotion of Caracalla prompted him to make a\r\n      pilgrimage from Edessa to the celebrated temple of the Moon at\r\n      Carrhæ. 381 He was attended by a body of cavalry: but having\r\n      stopped on the road for some necessary occasion, his guards\r\n      preserved a respectful distance, and Martialis, approaching his\r\n      person under a presence of duty, stabbed him with a dagger. The\r\n      bold assassin was instantly killed by a Scythian archer of the\r\n      Imperial guard. Such was the end of a monster whose life\r\n      disgraced human nature, and whose reign accused the patience of\r\n      the Romans. 39 The grateful soldiers forgot his vices, remembered\r\n      only his partial liberality, and obliged the senate to prostitute\r\n      their own dignity and that of religion, by granting him a place\r\n      among the gods. Whilst he was upon earth, Alexander the Great was\r\n      the only hero whom this god deemed worthy his admiration. He\r\n      assumed the name and ensigns of Alexander, formed a Macedonian\r\n      phalanx of guards, persecuted the disciples of Aristotle, and\r\n      displayed, with a puerile enthusiasm, the only sentiment by which\r\n      he discovered any regard for virtue or glory. We can easily\r\n      conceive, that after the battle of Narva, and the conquest of\r\n      Poland, Charles XII. (though he still wanted the more elegant\r\n      accomplishments of the son of Philip) might boast of having\r\n      rivalled his valor and magnanimity; but in no one action of his\r\n      life did Caracalla express the faintest resemblance of the\r\n      Macedonian hero, except in the murder of a great number of his\r\n      own and of his father’s friends. 40\r\n\r\n      381 (return) [ Carrhæ, now Harran, between Edessan and Nisibis,\r\n      famous for the defeat of Crassus—the Haran from whence Abraham\r\n      set out for the land of Canaan.

The choice of the army (for\r\n      the authority of a distant and feeble senate was little regarded)\r\n      hung in anxious suspense, as no candidate presented himself whose\r\n      distinguished birth and merit could engage their attachment and\r\n      unite their suffrages. The decisive weight of the Prætorian\r\n      guards elevated the hopes of their præfects, and these powerful\r\n      ministers began to assert their _legal_ claim to fill the vacancy\r\n      of the Imperial throne. Adventus, however, the senior præfect,\r\n      conscious of his age and infirmities, of his small reputation,\r\n      and his smaller abilities, resigned the dangerous honor to the\r\n      crafty ambition of his colleague Macrinus, whose well-dissembled\r\n      grief removed all suspicion of his being accessary to his\r\n      master’s death. 41 The troops neither loved nor esteemed his\r\n      character. They cast their eyes around in search of a competitor,\r\n      and at last yielded with reluctance to his promises of unbounded\r\n      liberality and indulgence. A short time after his accession, he\r\n      conferred on his son Diadumenianus, at the age of only ten years,\r\n      the Imperial title, and the popular name of Antoninus. The\r\n      beautiful figure of the youth, assisted by an additional\r\n      donative, for which the ceremony furnished a pretext, might\r\n      attract, it was hoped, the favor of the army, and secure the\r\n      doubtful throne of Macrinus.\r\n\r\n      41 (return) [ Herodian, l. iv. p. 169. Hist. August. p. 94.]\r\n\r\n      The authority of the new sovereign had been ratified by the\r\n      cheerful submission of the senate and provinces. They exulted in\r\n      their unexpected deliverance from a hated tyrant, and it seemed\r\n      of little consequence to examine into the virtues of the\r\n      successor of Caracalla. But as soon as the first transports of\r\n      joy and surprise had subsided, they began to scrutinize the\r\n      merits of Macrinus with a critical severity, and to arraign the\r\n      nasty choice of the army. It had hitherto been considered as a\r\n      fundamental maxim of the constitution, that the emperor must be\r\n      always chosen in the senate, and the sovereign power, no longer\r\n      exercised by the whole body, was always delegated to one of its\r\n      members. But Macrinus was not a senator. 42 The sudden elevation\r\n      of the Prætorian præfects betrayed the meanness of their origin;\r\n      and the equestrian order was still in possession of that great\r\n      office, which commanded with arbitrary sway the lives and\r\n      fortunes of the senate. A murmur of indignation was heard, that a\r\n      man, whose obscure 43 extraction had never been illustrated by\r\n      any signal service, should dare to invest himself with the\r\n      purple, instead of bestowing it on some distinguished senator,\r\n      equal in birth and dignity to the splendor of the Imperial\r\n      station. As soon as the character of Macrinus was surveyed by the\r\n      sharp eye of discontent, some vices, and many defects, were\r\n      easily discovered. The choice of his ministers was in many\r\n      instances justly censured, and the dissatisfied people, with\r\n      their usual candor, accused at once his indolent tameness and his\r\n      excessive severity. 44\r\n\r\n      42 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxxviii. p. 1350.

The personal favor of Plautianus and Sejanus had broke\r\n      through the established rule.

Trained in the arts of courts and the forms of civil\r\n      business, he trembled in the presence of the fierce and\r\n      undisciplined multitude, over whom he had assumed the command;\r\n      his military talents were despised, and his personal courage\r\n      suspected; a whisper that circulated in the camp, disclosed the\r\n      fatal secret of the conspiracy against the late emperor,\r\n      aggravated the guilt of murder by the baseness of hypocrisy, and\r\n      heightened contempt by detestation. To alienate the soldiers, and\r\n      to provoke inevitable ruin, the character of a reformer was only\r\n      wanting; and such was the peculiar hardship of his fate, that\r\n      Macrinus was compelled to exercise that invidious office. The\r\n      prodigality of Caracalla had left behind it a long train of ruin\r\n      and disorder; and if that worthless tyrant had been capable of\r\n      reflecting on the sure consequences of his own conduct, he would\r\n      perhaps have enjoyed the dark prospect of the distress and\r\n      calamities which he bequeathed to his successors.\r\n\r\n      In the management of this necessary reformation, Macrinus\r\n      proceeded with a cautious prudence, which would have restored\r\n      health and vigor to the Roman army in an easy and almost\r\n      imperceptible manner. To the soldiers already engaged in the\r\n      service, he was constrained to leave the dangerous privileges and\r\n      extravagant pay given by Caracalla; but the new recruits were\r\n      received on the more moderate though liberal establishment of\r\n      Severus, and gradually formed to modesty and obedience. 45 One\r\n      fatal error destroyed the salutary effects of this judicious\r\n      plan. The numerous army, assembled in the East by the late\r\n      emperor, instead of being immediately dispersed by Macrinus\r\n      through the several provinces, was suffered to remain united in\r\n      Syria, during the winter that followed his elevation. In the\r\n      luxurious idleness of their quarters, the troops viewed their\r\n      strength and numbers, communicated their complaints, and revolved\r\n      in their minds the advantages of another revolution. The\r\n      veterans, instead of being flattered by the advantageous\r\n      distinction, were alarmed by the first steps of the emperor,\r\n      which they considered as the presage of his future intentions.\r\n      The recruits, with sullen reluctance, entered on a service, whose\r\n      labors were increased while its rewards were diminished by a\r\n      covetous and unwarlike sovereign. The murmurs of the army swelled\r\n      with impunity into seditious clamors; and the partial mutinies\r\n      betrayed a spirit of discontent and disaffection that waited only\r\n      for the slightest occasion to break out on every side into a\r\n      general rebellion. To minds thus disposed, the occasion soon\r\n      presented itself.\r\n\r\n      45 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxxiii. p. 1336.

From an humble station she had been raised to greatness,\r\n      only to taste the superior bitterness of an exalted rank. She was\r\n      doomed to weep over the death of one of her sons, and over the\r\n      life of the other. The cruel fate of Caracalla, though her good\r\n      sense must have long taught her to expect it, awakened the\r\n      feelings of a mother and of an empress. Notwithstanding the\r\n      respectful civility expressed by the usurper towards the widow of\r\n      Severus, she descended with a painful struggle into the condition\r\n      of a subject, and soon withdrew herself, by a voluntary death,\r\n      from the anxious and humiliating dependence. 46 461 Julia Mæsa,\r\n      her sister, was ordered to leave the court and Antioch. She\r\n      retired to Emesa with an immense fortune, the fruit of twenty\r\n      years’ favor accompanied by her two daughters, Soæmias and Mamæ,\r\n      each of whom was a widow, and each had an only son. Bassianus,\r\n      462 for that was the name of the son of Soæmias, was consecrated\r\n      to the honorable ministry of high priest of the Sun; and this\r\n      holy vocation, embraced either from prudence or superstition,\r\n      contributed to raise the Syrian youth to the empire of Rome. A\r\n      numerous body of troops was stationed at Emesa; and as the severe\r\n      discipline of Macrinus had constrained them to pass the winter\r\n      encamped, they were eager to revenge the cruelty of such\r\n      unaccustomed hardships. The soldiers, who resorted in crowds to\r\n      the temple of the Sun, beheld with veneration and delight the\r\n      elegant dress and figure of the young pontiff; they recognized,\r\n      or they thought that they recognized, the features of Caracalla,\r\n      whose memory they now adored. The artful Mæsa saw and cherished\r\n      their rising partiality, and readily sacrificing her daughter’s\r\n      reputation to the fortune of her grandson, she insinuated that\r\n      Bassianus was the natural son of their murdered sovereign. The\r\n      sums distributed by her emissaries with a lavish hand silenced\r\n      every objection, and the profusion sufficiently proved the\r\n      affinity, or at least the resemblance, of Bassianus with the\r\n      great original. The young Antoninus (for he had assumed and\r\n      polluted that respectable name) was declared emperor by the\r\n      troops of Emesa, asserted his hereditary right, and called aloud\r\n      on the armies to follow the standard of a young and liberal\r\n      prince, who had taken up arms to revenge his father’s death and\r\n      the oppression of the military order. 47\r\n\r\n      46 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxviii. p. 1330.

But it appears, as\r\n      far as the mutilated text of Dion and the imperfect epitome of\r\n      Xiphilin permit us to judge, that she conceived projects of\r\n      ambition, and endeavored to raise herself to the empire. She\r\n      wished to tread in the steps of Semiramis and Nitocris, whose\r\n      country bordered on her own. Macrinus sent her an order\r\n      immediately to leave Antioch, and to retire wherever she chose.\r\n      She returned to her former purpose, and starved herself to\r\n      death.—G.]\r\n\r\n      462 (return) [ He inherited this name from his great-grandfather\r\n      of the mother’s side, Bassianus, father of Julia Mæsa, his\r\n      grandmother, and of Julia Domna, wife of Severus.

August. p. 135,)\r\n      Alexander Severus lived twenty-nine years three months and seven\r\n      days. As he was killed March 19, 235, he was born December 12,\r\n      205 and was consequently about this time thirteen years old, as\r\n      his elder cousin might be about seventeen. This computation suits\r\n      much better the history of the young princes than that of\r\n      Herodian, (l. v. p. 181,) who represents them as three years\r\n      younger; whilst, by an opposite error of chronology, he lengthens\r\n      the reign of Elagabalus two years beyond its real duration. For\r\n      the particulars of the conspiracy, see Dion, l. lxxviii. p. 1339.\r\n      Herodian, l. v. p. 184.]\r\n\r\n      Whilst a conspiracy of women and eunuchs was concerted with\r\n      prudence, and conducted with rapid vigor, Macrinus, who, by a\r\n      decisive motion, might have crushed his infant enemy, floated\r\n      between the opposite extremes of terror and security, which alike\r\n      fixed him inactive at Antioch. A spirit of rebellion diffused\r\n      itself through all the camps and garrisons of Syria, successive\r\n      detachments murdered their officers, 48 and joined the party of\r\n      the rebels; and the tardy restitution of military pay and\r\n      privileges was imputed to the acknowledged weakness of Macrinus.\r\n      At length he marched out of Antioch, to meet the increasing and\r\n      zealous army of the young pretender. His own troops seemed to\r\n      take the field with faintness and reluctance; but, in the heat of\r\n      the battle, 49 the Prætorian guards, almost by an involuntary\r\n      impulse, asserted the superiority of their valor and discipline.\r\n      The rebel ranks were broken; when the mother and grandmother of\r\n      the Syrian prince, who, according to their eastern custom, had\r\n      attended the army, threw themselves from their covered chariots,\r\n      and, by exciting the compassion of the soldiers, endeavored to\r\n      animate their drooping courage. Antoninus himself, who, in the\r\n      rest of his life, never acted like a man, in this important\r\n      crisis of his fate, approved himself a hero, mounted his horse,\r\n      and, at the head of his rallied troops, charged sword in hand\r\n      among the thickest of the enemy; whilst the eunuch Gannys, 491\r\n      whose occupations had been confined to female cares and the soft\r\n      luxury of Asia, displayed the talents of an able and experienced\r\n      general. The battle still raged with doubtful violence, and\r\n      Macrinus might have obtained the victory, had he not betrayed his\r\n      own cause by a shameful and precipitate flight. His cowardice\r\n      served only to protract his life a few days, and to stamp\r\n      deserved ignominy on his misfortunes. It is scarcely necessary to\r\n      add, that his son Diadumenianus was involved in the same fate.\r\n\r\n      As soon as the stubborn Prætorians could be convinced that they\r\n      fought for a prince who had basely deserted them, they\r\n      surrendered to the conqueror: the contending parties of the Roman\r\n      army, mingling tears of joy and tenderness, united under the\r\n      banners of the imagined son of Caracalla, and the East\r\n      acknowledged with pleasure the first emperor of Asiatic\r\n      extraction.\r\n\r\n      48 (return) [ By a most dangerous proclamation of the pretended\r\n      Antoninus, every soldier who brought in his officer’s head became\r\n      entitled to his private estate, as well as to his military\r\n      commission.]\r\n\r\n      49 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxviii. p. 1345.

Dion, p. 1355.—W]\r\n\r\n      The letters of Macrinus had condescended to inform the senate of\r\n      the slight disturbance occasioned by an impostor in Syria, and a\r\n      decree immediately passed, declaring the rebel and his family\r\n      public enemies; with a promise of pardon, however, to such of his\r\n      deluded adherents as should merit it by an immediate return to\r\n      their duty. During the twenty days that elapsed from the\r\n      declaration of the victory of Antoninus (for in so short an\r\n      interval was the fate of the Roman world decided,) the capital\r\n      and the provinces, more especially those of the East, were\r\n      distracted with hopes and fears, agitated with tumult, and\r\n      stained with a useless effusion of civil blood, since whosoever\r\n      of the rivals prevailed in Syria must reign over the empire. The\r\n      specious letters in which the young conqueror announced his\r\n      victory to the obedient senate were filled with professions of\r\n      virtue and moderation; the shining examples of Marcus and\r\n      Augustus, he should ever consider as the great rule of his\r\n      administration; and he affected to dwell with pride on the\r\n      striking resemblance of his own age and fortunes with those of\r\n      Augustus, who in the earliest youth had revenged, by a successful\r\n      war, the murder of his father. By adopting the style of Marcus\r\n      Aurelius Antoninus, son of Antoninus and grandson of Severus, he\r\n      tacitly asserted his hereditary claim to the empire; but, by\r\n      assuming the tribunitian and proconsular powers before they had\r\n      been conferred on him by a decree of the senate, he offended the\r\n      delicacy of Roman prejudice. This new and injudicious violation\r\n      of the constitution was probably dictated either by the ignorance\r\n      of his Syrian courtiers, or the fierce disdain of his military\r\n      followers. 50\r\n\r\n      50 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxix. p. 1353.]\r\n\r\n      As the attention of the new emperor was diverted by the most\r\n      trifling amusements, he wasted many months in his luxurious\r\n      progress from Syria to Italy, passed at Nicomedia his first\r\n      winter after his victory, and deferred till the ensuing summer\r\n      his triumphal entry into the capital. A faithful picture,\r\n      however, which preceded his arrival, and was placed by his\r\n      immediate order over the altar of Victory in the senate house,\r\n      conveyed to the Romans the just but unworthy resemblance of his\r\n      person and manners. He was drawn in his sacerdotal robes of silk\r\n      and gold, after the loose flowing fashion of the Medes and\r\n      Phœnicians; his head was covered with a lofty tiara, his numerous\r\n      collars and bracelets were adorned with gems of an inestimable\r\n      value. His eyebrows were tinged with black, and his cheeks\r\n      painted with an artificial red and white. 51 The grave senators\r\n      confessed with a sigh, that, after having long experienced the\r\n      stern tyranny of their own countrymen, Rome was at length humbled\r\n      beneath the effeminate luxury of Oriental despotism.\r\n\r\n      51 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxix. p. 1363. Herodian, l. v. p. 189.]\r\n\r\n      The Sun was worshipped at Emesa, under the name of Elagabalus, 52\r\n      and under the form of a black conical stone, which, as it was\r\n      universally believed, had fallen from heaven on that sacred\r\n      place. To this protecting deity, Antoninus, not without some\r\n      reason, ascribed his elevation to the throne. The display of\r\n      superstitious gratitude was the only serious business of his\r\n      reign. The triumph of the god of Emesa over all the religions of\r\n      the earth, was the great object of his zeal and vanity; and the\r\n      appellation of Elagabalus (for he presumed as pontiff and\r\n      favorite to adopt that sacred name) was dearer to him than all\r\n      the titles of Imperial greatness. In a solemn procession through\r\n      the streets of Rome, the way was strewed with gold dust; the\r\n      black stone, set in precious gems, was placed on a chariot drawn\r\n      by six milk-white horses richly caparisoned. The pious emperor\r\n      held the reins, and, supported by his ministers, moved slowly\r\n      backwards, that he might perpetually enjoy the felicity of the\r\n      divine presence. In a magnificent temple raised on the Palatine\r\n      Mount, the sacrifices of the god Elagabalus were celebrated with\r\n      every circumstance of cost and solemnity. The richest wines, the\r\n      most extraordinary victims, and the rarest aromatics, were\r\n      profusely consumed on his altar. Around the altar, a chorus of\r\n      Syrian damsels performed their lascivious dances to the sound of\r\n      barbarian music, whilst the gravest personages of the state and\r\n      army, clothed in long Phœnician tunics, officiated in the meanest\r\n      functions, with affected zeal and secret indignation. 53\r\n\r\n      52 (return) [ This name is derived by the learned from two Syrian\r\n      words, Ela a God, and Gabal, to form, the forming or plastic god,\r\n      a proper, and even happy epithet for the sun.

Herodian calls him; Lampridius, and the more modern\r\n      writers, make him Heliogabalus. Dion calls him Elegabalus; but\r\n      Elegabalus was the true name, as it appears on the medals.\r\n      (Eckhel. de Doct. num. vet. t. vii. p. 250.)

Pallas had been first\r\n      chosen for his consort; but as it was dreaded lest her warlike\r\n      terrors might affright the soft delicacy of a Syrian deity, the\r\n      Moon, adored by the Africans under the name of Astarte, was\r\n      deemed a more suitable companion for the Sun. Her image, with the\r\n      rich offerings of her temple as a marriage portion, was\r\n      transported with solemn pomp from Carthage to Rome, and the day\r\n      of these mystic nuptials was a general festival in the capital\r\n      and throughout the empire. 55\r\n\r\n      54 (return) [ He broke into the sanctuary of Vesta, and carried\r\n      away a statue, which he supposed to be the palladium; but the\r\n      vestals boasted that, by a pious fraud, they had imposed a\r\n      counterfeit image on the profane intruder.

But Elagabalus, (I speak\r\n      of the emperor of that name,) corrupted by his youth, his\r\n      country, and his fortune, abandoned himself to the grossest\r\n      pleasures with ungoverned fury, and soon found disgust and\r\n      satiety in the midst of his enjoyments. The inflammatory powers\r\n      of art were summoned to his aid: the confused multitude of women,\r\n      of wines, and of dishes, and the studied variety of attitude and\r\n      sauces, served to revive his languid appetites. New terms and new\r\n      inventions in these sciences, the only ones cultivated and\r\n      patronized by the monarch, 56 signalized his reign, and\r\n      transmitted his infamy to succeeding times. A capricious\r\n      prodigality supplied the want of taste and elegance; and whilst\r\n      Elagabalus lavished away the treasures of his people in the\r\n      wildest extravagance, his own voice and that of his flatterers\r\n      applauded a spirit of magnificence unknown to the tameness of his\r\n      predecessors. To confound the order of seasons and climates, 57\r\n      to sport with the passions and prejudices of his subjects, and to\r\n      subvert every law of nature and decency, were in the number of\r\n      his most delicious amusements. A long train of concubines, and a\r\n      rapid succession of wives, among whom was a vestal virgin,\r\n      ravished by force from her sacred asylum, 58 were insufficient to\r\n      satisfy the impotence of his passions. The master of the Roman\r\n      world affected to copy the dress and manners of the female sex,\r\n      preferred the distaff to the sceptre, and dishonored the\r\n      principal dignities of the empire by distributing them among his\r\n      numerous lovers; one of whom was publicly invested with the title\r\n      and authority of the emperor’s, or, as he more properly styled\r\n      himself, of the empress’s husband. 59\r\n\r\n      56 (return) [ The invention of a new sauce was liberally\r\n      rewarded; but if it was not relished, the inventor was confined\r\n      to eat of nothing else till he had discovered another more\r\n      agreeable to the Imperial palate Hist.

Secure\r\n      of impunity, careless of censure, they lived without restraint in\r\n      the patient and humble society of their slaves and parasites.

The licentious\r\n      soldiers, who had raised to the throne the dissolute son of\r\n      Caracalla, blushed at their ignominious choice, and turned with\r\n      disgust from that monster, to contemplate with pleasure the\r\n      opening virtues of his cousin Alexander, the son of Mamæa. The\r\n      crafty Mæsa, sensible that her grandson Elagabalus must\r\n      inevitably destroy himself by his own vices, had provided another\r\n      and surer support of her family. Embracing a favorable moment of\r\n      fondness and devotion, she had persuaded the young emperor to\r\n      adopt Alexander, and to invest him with the title of Cæsar, that\r\n      his own divine occupations might be no longer interrupted by the\r\n      care of the earth. In the second rank that amiable prince soon\r\n      acquired the affections of the public, and excited the tyrant’s\r\n      jealousy, who resolved to terminate the dangerous competition,\r\n      either by corrupting the manners, or by taking away the life, of\r\n      his rival. His arts proved unsuccessful; his vain designs were\r\n      constantly discovered by his own loquacious folly, and\r\n      disappointed by those virtuous and faithful servants whom the\r\n      prudence of Mamæa had placed about the person of her son. In a\r\n      hasty sally of passion, Elagabalus resolved to execute by force\r\n      what he had been unable to compass by fraud, and by a despotic\r\n      sentence degraded his cousin from the rank and honors of Cæsar.\r\n      The message was received in the senate with silence, and in the\r\n      camp with fury. The Prætorian guards swore to protect Alexander,\r\n      and to revenge the dishonored majesty of the throne. The tears\r\n      and promises of the trembling Elagabalus, who only begged them to\r\n      spare his life, and to leave him in the possession of his beloved\r\n      Hierocles, diverted their just indignation; and they contented\r\n      themselves with empowering their præfects to watch over the\r\n      safety of Alexander, and the conduct of the emperor. 61\r\n\r\n      61 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxix. p. 1365.

The\r\n      report of the death of Alexander, and the natural suspicion that\r\n      he had been murdered, inflamed their passions into fury, and the\r\n      tempest of the camp could only be appeased by the presence and\r\n      authority of the popular youth. Provoked at this new instance of\r\n      their affection for his cousin, and their contempt for his\r\n      person, the emperor ventured to punish some of the leaders of the\r\n      mutiny. His unseasonable severity proved instantly fatal to his\r\n      minions, his mother, and himself. Elagabalus was massacred by the\r\n      indignant Prætorians, his mutilated corpse dragged through the\r\n      streets of the city, and thrown into the Tiber. His memory was\r\n      branded with eternal infamy by the senate; the justice of whose\r\n      decree has been ratified by posterity. 62\r\n\r\n      62 (return) [ The æra of the death of Elagabalus, and of the\r\n      accession of Alexander, has employed the learning and ingenuity\r\n      of Pagi, Tillemont, Valsecchi, Vignoli, and Torre, bishop of\r\n      Adria. The question is most assuredly intricate; but I still\r\n      adhere to the authority of Dion, the truth of whose calculations\r\n      is undeniable, and the purity of whose text is justified by the\r\n      agreement of Xiphilin, Zonaras, and Cedrenus. Elagabalus reigned\r\n      three years nine months and four days, from his victory over\r\n      Macrinus, and was killed March 10, 222. But what shall we reply\r\n      to the medals, undoubtedly genuine, which reckon the fifth year\r\n      of his tribunitian power? We shall reply, with the learned\r\n      Valsecchi, that the usurpation of Macrinus was annihilated, and\r\n      that the son of Caracalla dated his reign from his father’s\r\n      death? After resolving this great difficulty, the smaller knots\r\n      of this question may be easily untied, or cut asunder. Note: This\r\n      opinion of Valsecchi has been triumphantly contested by Eckhel,\r\n      who has shown the impossibility of reconciling it with the medals\r\n      of Elagabalus, and has given the most satisfactory explanation of\r\n      the five tribunates of that emperor. He ascended the throne and\r\n      received the tribunitian power the 16th of May, in the year of\r\n      Rome 971; and on the 1st January of the next year, 972, he began\r\n      a new tribunate, according to the custom established by preceding\r\n      emperors. During the years 972, 973, 974, he enjoyed the\r\n      tribunate, and commenced his fifth in the year 975, during which\r\n      he was killed on the 10th March. Eckhel de Doct.

His relation to the family of\r\n      Severus, whose name he assumed, was the same as that of his\r\n      predecessor; his virtue and his danger had already endeared him\r\n      to the Romans, and the eager liberality of the senate conferred\r\n      upon him, in one day, the various titles and powers of the\r\n      Imperial dignity. 63 But as Alexander was a modest and dutiful\r\n      youth, of only seventeen years of age, the reins of government\r\n      were in the hands of two women, of his mother, Mamæa, and of\r\n      Mæsa, his grandmother. After the death of the latter, who\r\n      survived but a short time the elevation of Alexander, Mamæa\r\n      remained the sole regent of her son and of the empire.\r\n\r\n      63 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 114. By this unusual\r\n      precipitation, the senate meant to confound the hopes of\r\n      pretenders, and prevent the factions of the armies.]\r\n\r\n      In every age and country, the wiser, or at least the stronger, of\r\n      the two sexes, has usurped the powers of the state, and confined\r\n      the other to the cares and pleasures of domestic life. In\r\n      hereditary monarchies, however, and especially in those of modern\r\n      Europe, the gallant spirit of chivalry, and the law of\r\n      succession, have accustomed us to allow a singular exception; and\r\n      a woman is often acknowledged the absolute sovereign of a great\r\n      kingdom, in which she would be deemed incapable of exercising the\r\n      smallest employment, civil or military. But as the Roman emperors\r\n      were still considered as the generals and magistrates of the\r\n      republic, their wives and mothers, although distinguished by the\r\n      name of Augusta, were never associated to their personal honors;\r\n      and a female reign would have appeared an inexpiable prodigy in\r\n      the eyes of those primitive Romans, who married without love, or\r\n      loved without delicacy and respect. 64 The haughty Agrippina\r\n      aspired, indeed, to share the honors of the empire which she had\r\n      conferred on her son; but her mad ambition, detested by every\r\n      citizen who felt for the dignity of Rome, was disappointed by the\r\n      artful firmness of Seneca and Burrhus. 65 The good sense, or the\r\n      indifference, of succeeding princes, restrained them from\r\n      offending the prejudices of their subjects; and it was reserved\r\n      for the profligate Elagabalus to discharge the acts of the senate\r\n      with the name of his mother Soæmias, who was placed by the side\r\n      of the consuls, and subscribed, as a regular member, the decrees\r\n      of the legislative assembly. Her more prudent sister, Mamæa,\r\n      declined the useless and odious prerogative, and a solemn law was\r\n      enacted, excluding women forever from the senate, and devoting to\r\n      the infernal gods the head of the wretch by whom this sanction\r\n      should be violated. 66 The substance, not the pageantry, of power\r\n      was the object of Mamæa’s manly ambition. She maintained an\r\n      absolute and lasting empire over the mind of her son, and in his\r\n      affection the mother could not brook a rival. Alexander, with her\r\n      consent, married the daughter of a patrician; but his respect for\r\n      his father-in-law, and love for the empress, were inconsistent\r\n      with the tenderness of interest of Mamæa. The patrician was\r\n      executed on the ready accusation of treason, and the wife of\r\n      Alexander driven with ignominy from the palace, and banished into\r\n      Africa. 67\r\n\r\n      64 (return) [ Metellus Numidicus, the censor, acknowledged to the\r\n      Roman people, in a public oration, that had kind nature allowed\r\n      us to exist without the help of women, we should be delivered\r\n      from a very troublesome companion; and he could recommend\r\n      matrimony only as the sacrifice of private pleasure to public\r\n      duty.

It is impossible to pronounce between them; but Dion\r\n      is an irreproachable witness of the jealousy and cruelty of Mamæa\r\n      towards the young empress, whose hard fate Alexander lamented,\r\n      but durst not oppose.]\r\n\r\n      Notwithstanding this act of jealous cruelty, as well as some\r\n      instances of avarice, with which Mamæa is charged, the general\r\n      tenor of her administration was equally for the benefit of her\r\n      son and of the empire. With the approbation of the senate, she\r\n      chose sixteen of the wisest and most virtuous senators as a\r\n      perpetual council of state, before whom every public business of\r\n      moment was debated and determined. The celebrated Ulpian, equally\r\n      distinguished by his knowledge of, and his respect for, the laws\r\n      of Rome, was at their head; and the prudent firmness of this\r\n      aristocracy restored order and authority to the government. As\r\n      soon as they had purged the city from foreign superstition and\r\n      luxury, the remains of the capricious tyranny of Elagabalus, they\r\n      applied themselves to remove his worthless creatures from every\r\n      department of the public administration, and to supply their\r\n      places with men of virtue and ability. Learning, and the love of\r\n      justice, became the only recommendations for civil offices;\r\n      valor, and the love of discipline, the only qualifications for\r\n      military employments. 68\r\n\r\n      68 (return) [ Herodian, l. vi. p. 203.

The fortunate soil assisted, and even\r\n      prevented, the hand of cultivation. An excellent understanding\r\n      soon convinced Alexander of the advantages of virtue, the\r\n      pleasure of knowledge, and the necessity of labor. A natural\r\n      mildness and moderation of temper preserved him from the assaults\r\n      of passion, and the allurements of vice. His unalterable regard\r\n      for his mother, and his esteem for the wise Ulpian, guarded his\r\n      unexperienced youth from the poison of flattery. 581\r\n\r\n      581 (return) [ Alexander received into his chapel all the\r\n      religions which prevailed in the empire; he admitted Jesus\r\n      Christ, Abraham, Orpheus, Apollonius of Tyana, &c. It was almost\r\n      certain that his mother Mamæa had instructed him in the morality\r\n      of Christianity. Historians in general agree in calling her a\r\n      Christian; there is reason to believe that she had begun to have\r\n      a taste for the principles of Christianity. (See Tillemont,\r\n      Alexander Severus) Gibbon has not noticed this circumstance; he\r\n      appears to have wished to lower the character of this empress; he\r\n      has throughout followed the narrative of Herodian, who, by the\r\n      acknowledgment of Capitolinus himself, detested Alexander.\r\n      Without believing the exaggerated praises of Lampridius, he ought\r\n      not to have followed the unjust severity of Herodian, and, above\r\n      all, not to have forgotten to say that the virtuous Alexander\r\n      Severus had insured to the Jews the preservation of their\r\n      privileges, and permitted the exercise of Christianity.

The Christians had established their worship in a\r\n      public place, of which the victuallers (cauponarii) claimed, not\r\n      the property, but possession by custom.

I have scrupled to\r\n      omit this note, as it contains some points worthy of notice; but\r\n      it is very unjust to Gibbon, who mentions almost all the\r\n      circumstances, which he is accused of omitting, in another, and,\r\n      according to his plan, a better place, and, perhaps, in stronger\r\n      terms than M. Guizot. See Chap. xvi.— M.]\r\n\r\n      The simple journal of his ordinary occupations exhibits a\r\n      pleasing picture of an accomplished emperor, 69 and, with some\r\n      allowance for the difference of manners, might well deserve the\r\n      imitation of modern princes. Alexander rose early: the first\r\n      moments of the day were consecrated to private devotion, and his\r\n      domestic chapel was filled with the images of those heroes, who,\r\n      by improving or reforming human life, had deserved the grateful\r\n      reverence of posterity. But as he deemed the service of mankind\r\n      the most acceptable worship of the gods, the greatest part of his\r\n      morning hours was employed in his council, where he discussed\r\n      public affairs, and determined private causes, with a patience\r\n      and discretion above his years. The dryness of business was\r\n      relieved by the charms of literature; and a portion of time was\r\n      always set apart for his favorite studies of poetry, history, and\r\n      philosophy. The works of Virgil and Horace, the republics of\r\n      Plato and Cicero, formed his taste, enlarged his understanding,\r\n      and gave him the noblest ideas of man and government. The\r\n      exercises of the body succeeded to those of the mind; and\r\n      Alexander, who was tall, active, and robust, surpassed most of\r\n      his equals in the gymnastic arts. Refreshed by the use of the\r\n      bath and a slight dinner, he resumed, with new vigor, the\r\n      business of the day; and, till the hour of supper, the principal\r\n      meal of the Romans, he was attended by his secretaries, with whom\r\n      he read and answered the multitude of letters, memorials, and\r\n      petitions, that must have been addressed to the master of the\r\n      greatest part of the world. His table was served with the most\r\n      frugal simplicity, and whenever he was at liberty to consult his\r\n      own inclination, the company consisted of a few select friends,\r\n      men of learning and virtue, amongst whom Ulpian was constantly\r\n      invited. Their conversation was familiar and instructive; and the\r\n      pauses were occasionally enlivened by the recital of some\r\n      pleasing composition, which supplied the place of the dancers,\r\n      comedians, and even gladiators, so frequently summoned to the\r\n      tables of the rich and luxurious Romans. 70 The dress of\r\n      Alexander was plain and modest, his demeanor courteous and\r\n      affable: at the proper hours his palace was open to all his\r\n      subjects, but the voice of a crier was heard, as in the\r\n      Eleusinian mysteries, pronouncing the same salutary admonition:\r\n      “Let none enter these holy walls, unless he is conscious of a\r\n      pure and innocent mind.” 71\r\n\r\n      69 (return) [ See his life in the Augustan History.

August. p. 119.]\r\n\r\n      Such a uniform tenor of life, which left not a moment for vice or\r\n      folly, is a better proof of the wisdom and justice of Alexander’s\r\n      government, than all the trifling details preserved in the\r\n      compilation of Lampridius. Since the accession of Commodus, the\r\n      Roman world had experienced, during the term of forty years, the\r\n      successive and various vices of four tyrants. From the death of\r\n      Elagabalus, it enjoyed an auspicious calm of thirteen years. 711\r\n      The provinces, relieved from the oppressive taxes invented by\r\n      Caracalla and his pretended son, flourished in peace and\r\n      prosperity, under the administration of magistrates who were\r\n      convinced by experience that to deserve the love of the subjects\r\n      was their best and only method of obtaining the favor of their\r\n      sovereign. While some gentle restraints were imposed on the\r\n      innocent luxury of the Roman people, the price of provisions and\r\n      the interest of money, were reduced by the paternal care of\r\n      Alexander, whose prudent liberality, without distressing the\r\n      industrious, supplied the wants and amusements of the populace.\r\n      The dignity, the freedom, the authority of the senate was\r\n      restored; and every virtuous senator might approach the person of\r\n      the emperor without a fear and without a blush.\r\n\r\n      711 (return) [ Wenck observes that Gibbon, enchanted with the\r\n      virtue of Alexander has heightened, particularly in this\r\n      sentence, its effect on the state of the world.

It became the honorable\r\n      appellation of the sons of Severus, was bestowed on young\r\n      Diadumenianus, and at length prostituted to the infamy of the\r\n      high priest of Emesa. Alexander, though pressed by the studied,\r\n      and, perhaps, sincere importunity of the senate, nobly refused\r\n      the borrowed lustre of a name; whilst in his whole conduct he\r\n      labored to restore the glories and felicity of the age of the\r\n      genuine Antonines. 72\r\n\r\n      72 (return) [ See, in the Hist.

Before the appellation\r\n      of Antoninus was offered him as a title of honor, the senate\r\n      waited to see whether Alexander would not assume it as a family\r\n      name.]\r\n\r\n      In the civil administration of Alexander, wisdom was enforced by\r\n      power, and the people, sensible of the public felicity, repaid\r\n      their benefactor with their love and gratitude. There still\r\n      remained a greater, a more necessary, but a more difficult\r\n      enterprise; the reformation of the military order, whose interest\r\n      and temper, confirmed by long impunity, rendered them impatient\r\n      of the restraints of discipline, and careless of the blessings of\r\n      public tranquillity. In the execution of his design, the emperor\r\n      affected to display his love, and to conceal his fear of the\r\n      army. The most rigid economy in every other branch of the\r\n      administration supplied a fund of gold and silver for the\r\n      ordinary pay and the extraordinary rewards of the troops. In\r\n      their marches he relaxed the severe obligation of carrying\r\n      seventeen days’ provision on their shoulders. Ample magazines\r\n      were formed along the public roads, and as soon as they entered\r\n      the enemy’s country, a numerous train of mules and camels waited\r\n      on their haughty laziness. As Alexander despaired of correcting\r\n      the luxury of his soldiers, he attempted, at least, to direct it\r\n      to objects of martial pomp and ornament, fine horses, splendid\r\n      armor, and shields enriched with silver and gold. He shared\r\n      whatever fatigues he was obliged to impose, visited, in person,\r\n      the sick and wounded, preserved an exact register of their\r\n      services and his own gratitude, and expressed on every occasion,\r\n      the warmest regard for a body of men, whose welfare, as he\r\n      affected to declare, was so closely connected with that of the\r\n      state. 73 By the most gentle arts he labored to inspire the\r\n      fierce multitude with a sense of duty, and to restore at least a\r\n      faint image of that discipline to which the Romans owed their\r\n      empire over so many other nations, as warlike and more powerful\r\n      than themselves. But his prudence was vain, his courage fatal,\r\n      and the attempt towards a reformation served only to inflame the\r\n      ills it was meant to cure.\r\n\r\n      73 (return) [ It was a favorite saying of the emperor’s Se\r\n      milites magis servare, quam seipsum, quod salus publica in his\r\n      esset.

That amiable\r\n      prince was sensible of the obligation; but as his gratitude was\r\n      restrained within the limits of reason and justice, they soon\r\n      were more dissatisfied with the virtues of Alexander, than they\r\n      had ever been with the vices of Elagabalus. Their præfect, the\r\n      wise Ulpian, was the friend of the laws and of the people; he was\r\n      considered as the enemy of the soldiers, and to his pernicious\r\n      counsels every scheme of reformation was imputed. Some trifling\r\n      accident blew up their discontent into a furious mutiny; and the\r\n      civil war raged, during three days, in Rome, whilst the life of\r\n      that excellent minister was defended by the grateful people.\r\n      Terrified, at length, by the sight of some houses in flames, and\r\n      by the threats of a general conflagration, the people yielded\r\n      with a sigh, and left the virtuous but unfortunate Ulpian to his\r\n      fate. He was pursued into the Imperial palace, and massacred at\r\n      the feet of his master, who vainly strove to cover him with the\r\n      purple, and to obtain his pardon from the inexorable soldiers.\r\n      731 Such was the deplorable weakness of government, that the\r\n      emperor was unable to revenge his murdered friend and his\r\n      insulted dignity, without stooping to the arts of patience and\r\n      dissimulation. Epagathus, the principal leader of the mutiny, was\r\n      removed from Rome, by the honorable employment of præfect of\r\n      Egypt: from that high rank he was gently degraded to the\r\n      government of Crete; and when at length, his popularity among the\r\n      guards was effaced by time and absence, Alexander ventured to\r\n      inflict the tardy but deserved punishment of his crimes. 74 Under\r\n      the reign of a just and virtuous prince, the tyranny of the army\r\n      threatened with instant death his most faithful ministers, who\r\n      were suspected of an intention to correct their intolerable\r\n      disorders. The historian Dion Cassius had commanded the Pannonian\r\n      legions with the spirit of ancient discipline. Their brethren of\r\n      Rome, embracing the common cause of military license, demanded\r\n      the head of the reformer. Alexander, however, instead of yielding\r\n      to their seditious clamors, showed a just sense of his merit and\r\n      services, by appointing him his colleague in the consulship, and\r\n      defraying from his own treasury the expense of that vain dignity:\r\n      but as was justly apprehended, that if the soldiers beheld him\r\n      with the ensigns of his office, they would revenge the insult in\r\n      his blood, the nominal first magistrate of the state retired, by\r\n      the emperor’s advice, from the city, and spent the greatest part\r\n      of his consulship at his villas in Campania. 75 751\r\n\r\n      731 (return) [ Gibbon has confounded two events altogether\r\n      different— the quarrel of the people with the Prætorians, which\r\n      lasted three days, and the assassination of Ulpian by the latter.\r\n      Dion relates first the death of Ulpian, afterwards, reverting\r\n      back according to a manner which is usual with him, he says that\r\n      during the life of Ulpian, there had been a war of three days\r\n      between the Prætorians and the people.

He asked and obtained leave to pass the\r\n      rest of his life in his native city, (Nice, in Bithynia: ) it was\r\n      there that he finished his history, which closes with his second\r\n      consulship.—W.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter VI: Death Of Severus, Tyranny Of Caracalla, Usurpation Of\r\n      Marcinus.—Part IV.\r\n\r\n      The lenity of the emperor confirmed the insolence of the troops;\r\n      the legions imitated the example of the guards, and defended\r\n      their prerogative of licentiousness with the same furious\r\n      obstinacy. The administration of Alexander was an unavailing\r\n      struggle against the corruption of his age. In llyricum, in\r\n      Mauritania, in Armenia, in Mesopotamia, in Germany, fresh\r\n      mutinies perpetually broke out; his officers were murdered, his\r\n      authority was insulted, and his life at last sacrificed to the\r\n      fierce discontents of the army. 76 One particular fact well\r\n      deserves to be recorded, as it illustrates the manners of the\r\n      troops, and exhibits a singular instance of their return to a\r\n      sense of duty and obedience. Whilst the emperor lay at Antioch,\r\n      in his Persian expedition, the particulars of which we shall\r\n      hereafter relate, the punishment of some soldiers, who had been\r\n      discovered in the baths of women, excited a sedition in the\r\n      legion to which they belonged. Alexander ascended his tribunal,\r\n      and with a modest firmness represented to the armed multitude the\r\n      absolute necessity, as well as his inflexible resolution, of\r\n      correcting the vices introduced by his impure predecessor, and of\r\n      maintaining the discipline, which could not be relaxed without\r\n      the ruin of the Roman name and empire. Their clamors interrupted\r\n      his mild expostulation. “Reserve your shout,” said the undaunted\r\n      emperor, “till you take the field against the Persians, the\r\n      Germans, and the Sarmatians. Be silent in the presence of your\r\n      sovereign and benefactor, who bestows upon you the corn, the\r\n      clothing, and the money of the provinces. Be silent, or I shall\r\n      no longer style you solders, but _citizens_, 77 if those indeed\r\n      who disclaim the laws of Rome deserve to be ranked among the\r\n      meanest of the people.” His menaces inflamed the fury of the\r\n      legion, and their brandished arms already threatened his person.\r\n      “Your courage,” resumed the intrepid Alexander, “would be more\r\n      nobly displayed in the field of battle; _me_ you may destroy, you\r\n      cannot intimidate; and the severe justice of the republic would\r\n      punish your crime and revenge my death.” The legion still\r\n      persisted in clamorous sedition, when the emperor pronounced,\r\n      with a loud voice, the decisive sentence, “_Citizens!_ lay down\r\n      your arms, and depart in peace to your respective habitations.”\r\n      The tempest was instantly appeased: the soldiers, filled with\r\n      grief and shame, silently confessed the justice of their\r\n      punishment, and the power of discipline, yielded up their arms\r\n      and military ensigns, and retired in confusion, not to their\r\n      camp, but to the several inns of the city. Alexander enjoyed,\r\n      during thirty days, the edifying spectacle of their repentance;\r\n      nor did he restore them to their former rank in the army, till he\r\n      had punished with death those tribunes whose connivance had\r\n      occasioned the mutiny. The grateful legion served the emperor\r\n      whilst living, and revenged him when dead. 78\r\n\r\n      76 (return) [ Annot.

The\r\n      internal change, which undermined the foundations of the empire,\r\n      we have endeavored to explain with some degree of order and\r\n      perspicuity. The personal characters of the emperors, their\r\n      victories, laws, follies, and fortunes, can interest us no\r\n      farther than as they are connected with the general history of\r\n      the Decline and Fall of the monarchy. Our constant attention to\r\n      that great object will not suffer us to overlook a most important\r\n      edict of Antoninus Caracalla, which communicated to all the free\r\n      inhabitants of the empire the name and privileges of Roman\r\n      citizens. His unbounded liberality flowed not, however, from the\r\n      sentiments of a generous mind; it was the sordid result of\r\n      avarice, and will naturally be illustrated by some observations\r\n      on the finances of that state, from the victorious ages of the\r\n      commonwealth to the reign of Alexander Severus.\r\n\r\n      The siege of Veii in Tuscany, the first considerable enterprise\r\n      of the Romans, was protracted to the tenth year, much less by the\r\n      strength of the place than by the unskilfulness of the besiegers.\r\n      The unaccustomed hardships of so many winter campaigns, at the\r\n      distance of near twenty miles from home, 81 required more than\r\n      common encouragements; and the senate wisely prevented the\r\n      clamors of the people, by the institution of a regular pay for\r\n      the soldiers, which was levied by a general tribute, assessed\r\n      according to an equitable proportion on the property of the\r\n      citizens. 82 During more than two hundred years after the\r\n      conquest of Veii, the victories of the republic added less to the\r\n      wealth than to the power of Rome. The states of Italy paid their\r\n      tribute in military service only, and the vast force, both by sea\r\n      and land, which was exerted in the Punic wars, was maintained at\r\n      the expense of the Romans themselves. That high-spirited people\r\n      (such is often the generous enthusiasm of freedom) cheerfully\r\n      submitted to the most excessive but voluntary burdens, in the\r\n      just confidence that they should speedily enjoy the rich harvest\r\n      of their labors. Their expectations were not disappointed. In the\r\n      course of a few years, the riches of Syracuse, of Carthage, of\r\n      Macedonia, and of Asia, were brought in triumph to Rome. The\r\n      treasures of Perseus alone amounted to near two millions\r\n      sterling, and the Roman people, the sovereign of so many nations,\r\n      was forever delivered from the weight of taxes. 83 The increasing\r\n      revenue of the provinces was found sufficient to defray the\r\n      ordinary establishment of war and government, and the superfluous\r\n      mass of gold and silver was deposited in the temple of Saturn,\r\n      and reserved for any unforeseen emergency of the state. 84\r\n\r\n      81 (return) [ According to the more accurate Dionysius, the city\r\n      itself was only a hundred stadia, or twelve miles and a half,\r\n      from Rome, though some out-posts might be advanced farther on the\r\n      side of Etruria.

We are informed\r\n      that, by the conquests of Pompey, the tributes of Asia were\r\n      raised from fifty to one hundred and thirty-five millions of\r\n      drachms; or about four millions and a half sterling. 86 861 Under\r\n      the last and most indolent of the Ptolemies, the revenue of Egypt\r\n      is said to have amounted to twelve thousand five hundred talents;\r\n      a sum equivalent to more than two millions and a half of our\r\n      money, but which was afterwards considerably improved by the more\r\n      exact economy of the Romans, and the increase of the trade of\r\n      Æthiopia and India. 87 Gaul was enriched by rapine, as Egypt was\r\n      by commerce, and the tributes of those two great provinces have\r\n      been compared as nearly equal to each other in value. 88 The ten\r\n      thousand Euboic or Phœnician talents, about four millions\r\n      sterling, 89 which vanquished Carthage was condemned to pay\r\n      within the term of fifty years, were a slight acknowledgment of\r\n      the superiority of Rome, 90 and cannot bear the least proportion\r\n      with the taxes afterwards raised both on the lands and on the\r\n      persons of the inhabitants, when the fertile coast of Africa was\r\n      reduced into a province. 91\r\n\r\n      841 (return) [ See Rationarium imperii.

Note: If Justus Lipsius has\r\n      exaggerated the revenue of the Roman empire Gibbon, on the other\r\n      hand, has underrated it. He fixes it at fifteen or twenty\r\n      millions of our money. But if we take only, on a moderate\r\n      calculation, the taxes in the provinces which he has already\r\n      cited, they will amount, considering the augmentations made by\r\n      Augustus, to nearly that sum. There remain also the provinces of\r\n      Italy, of Rhætia, of Noricum, Pannonia, and Greece, &c., &c. Let\r\n      us pay attention, besides, to the prodigious expenditure of some\r\n      emperors, (Suet. Vesp. 16;) we shall see that such a revenue\r\n      could not be sufficient. The authors of the Universal History,\r\n      part xii., assign forty millions sterling as the sum to about\r\n      which the public revenue might amount.—G. from W.]\r\n\r\n      Notwithstanding the seeming probability of both these\r\n      conclusions, the latter of them at least is positively disowned\r\n      by the language and conduct of Augustus. It is not easy to\r\n      determine whether, on this occasion, he acted as the common\r\n      father of the Roman world, or as the oppressor of liberty;\r\n      whether he wished to relieve the provinces, or to impoverish the\r\n      senate and the equestrian order. But no sooner had he assumed the\r\n      reins of government, than he frequently intimated the\r\n      insufficiency of the tributes, and the necessity of throwing an\r\n      equitable proportion of the public burden upon Rome and Italy.\r\n      961 In the prosecution of this unpopular design, he advanced,\r\n      however, by cautious and well-weighed steps. The introduction of\r\n      customs was followed by the establishment of an excise, and the\r\n      scheme of taxation was completed by an artful assessment on the\r\n      real and personal property of the Roman citizens, who had been\r\n      exempted from any kind of contribution above a century and a\r\n      half.\r\n\r\n      961 (return) [ It is not astonishing that Augustus held this\r\n      language.

In a great empire like that of Rome, a natural balance of\r\n      money must have gradually established itself. It has been already\r\n      observed, that as the wealth of the provinces was attracted to\r\n      the capital by the strong hand of conquest and power, so a\r\n      considerable part of it was restored to the industrious provinces\r\n      by the gentle influence of commerce and arts. In the reign of\r\n      Augustus and his successors, duties were imposed on every kind of\r\n      merchandise, which through a thousand channels flowed to the\r\n      great centre of opulence and luxury; and in whatsoever manner the\r\n      law was expressed, it was the Roman purchaser, and not the\r\n      provincial merchant, who paid the tax. 97 The rate of the customs\r\n      varied from the eighth to the fortieth part of the value of the\r\n      commodity; and we have a right to suppose that the variation was\r\n      directed by the unalterable maxims of policy; that a higher duty\r\n      was fixed on the articles of luxury than on those of necessity,\r\n      and that the productions raised or manufactured by the labor of\r\n      the subjects of the empire were treated with more indulgence than\r\n      was shown to the pernicious, or at least the unpopular, commerce\r\n      of Arabia and India. 98 There is still extant a long but\r\n      imperfect catalogue of eastern commodities, which about the time\r\n      of Alexander Severus were subject to the payment of duties;\r\n      cinnamon, myrrh, pepper, ginger, and the whole tribe of\r\n      aromatics; a great variety of precious stones, among which the\r\n      diamond was the most remarkable for its price, and the emerald\r\n      for its beauty; 99 Parthian and Babylonian leather, cottons,\r\n      silks, both raw and manufactured, ebony ivory, and eunuchs. 100\r\n      We may observe that the use and value of those effeminate slaves\r\n      gradually rose with the decline of the empire.\r\n\r\n      97 (return) [ Tacit.

It seldom exceeded one\r\n      _per cent_.; but it comprehended whatever was sold in the markets\r\n      or by public auction, from the most considerable purchases of\r\n      lands and houses, to those minute objects which can only derive a\r\n      value from their infinite multitude and daily consumption. Such a\r\n      tax, as it affects the body of the people, has ever been the\r\n      occasion of clamor and discontent. An emperor well acquainted\r\n      with the wants and resources of the state was obliged to declare,\r\n      by a public edict, that the support of the army depended in a\r\n      great measure on the produce of the excise. 101\r\n\r\n      101 (return) [ Tacit. Annal. i. 78. Two years afterwards, the\r\n      reduction of the poor kingdom of Cappadocia gave Tiberius a\r\n      pretence for diminishing the excise of one half, but the relief\r\n      was of very short duration.]\r\n\r\n      III. When Augustus resolved to establish a permanent military\r\n      force for the defence of his government against foreign and\r\n      domestic enemies, he instituted a peculiar treasury for the pay\r\n      of the soldiers, the rewards of the veterans, and the\r\n      extra-ordinary expenses of war. The ample revenue of the excise,\r\n      though peculiarly appropriated to those uses, was found\r\n      inadequate. To supply the deficiency, the emperor suggested a new\r\n      tax of five per cent. on all legacies and inheritances. But the\r\n      nobles of Rome were more tenacious of property than of freedom.\r\n      Their indignant murmurs were received by Augustus with his usual\r\n      temper. He candidly referred the whole business to the senate,\r\n      and exhorted them to provide for the public service by some other\r\n      expedient of a less odious nature. They were divided and\r\n      perplexed. He insinuated to them, that their obstinacy would\r\n      oblige him to _propose_ a general land tax and capitation. They\r\n      acquiesced in silence. 102 The new imposition on legacies and\r\n      inheritances was, however, mitigated by some restrictions. It did\r\n      not take place unless the object was of a certain value, most\r\n      probably of fifty or a hundred pieces of gold; 103 nor could it\r\n      be exacted from the nearest of kin on the father’s side. 104 When\r\n      the rights of nature and poverty were thus secured, it seemed\r\n      reasonable, that a stranger, or a distant relation, who acquired\r\n      an unexpected accession of fortune, should cheerfully resign a\r\n      twentieth part of it, for the benefit of the state. 105\r\n\r\n      102 (return) [ Dion Cassius, l. lv. p. 794, l. lvi. p. 825.

The senators\r\n      then preferred giving the tax on legacies and inheritances.—W.]\r\n\r\n      103 (return) [ The sum is only fixed by conjecture.]\r\n\r\n      104 (return) [ As the Roman law subsisted for many ages, the\r\n      Cognati, or relations on the mother’s side, were not called to\r\n      the succession.

From various causes,\r\n      the partiality of paternal affection often lost its influence\r\n      over the stern patriots of the commonwealth, and the dissolute\r\n      nobles of the empire; and if the father bequeathed to his son the\r\n      fourth part of his estate, he removed all ground of legal\r\n      complaint. 106 But a rich childish old man was a domestic tyrant,\r\n      and his power increased with his years and infirmities. A servile\r\n      crowd, in which he frequently reckoned prætors and consuls,\r\n      courted his smiles, pampered his avarice, applauded his follies,\r\n      served his passions, and waited with impatience for his death.\r\n      The arts of attendance and flattery were formed into a most\r\n      lucrative science; those who professed it acquired a peculiar\r\n      appellation; and the whole city, according to the lively\r\n      descriptions of satire, was divided between two parties, the\r\n      hunters and their game. 107 Yet, while so many unjust and\r\n      extravagant wills were every day dictated by cunning and\r\n      subscribed by folly, a few were the result of rational esteem and\r\n      virtuous gratitude. Cicero, who had so often defended the lives\r\n      and fortunes of his fellow-citizens, was rewarded with legacies\r\n      to the amount of a hundred and seventy thousand pounds; 108 nor\r\n      do the friends of the younger Pliny seem to have been less\r\n      generous to that amiable orator. 109 Whatever was the motive of\r\n      the testator, the treasury claimed, without distinction, the\r\n      twentieth part of his estate: and in the course of two or three\r\n      generations, the whole property of the subject must have\r\n      gradually passed through the coffers of the state.\r\n\r\n      106 (return) [ See Heineccius in the Antiquit.

Every such will gave him an\r\n      occasion of displaying his reverence to the dead, and his justice\r\n      to the living. He reconciled both in his behavior to a son who\r\n      had been disinherited by his mother, (v.l.)]\r\n\r\n      In the first and golden years of the reign of Nero, that prince,\r\n      from a desire of popularity, and perhaps from a blind impulse of\r\n      benevolence, conceived a wish of abolishing the oppression of the\r\n      customs and excise. The wisest senators applauded his\r\n      magnanimity: but they diverted him from the execution of a design\r\n      which would have dissolved the strength and resources of the\r\n      republic. 110 Had it indeed been possible to realize this dream\r\n      of fancy, such princes as Trajan and the Antonines would surely\r\n      have embraced with ardor the glorious opportunity of conferring\r\n      so signal an obligation on mankind. Satisfied, however, with\r\n      alleviating the public burden, they attempted not to remove it.\r\n      The mildness and precision of their laws ascertained the rule and\r\n      measure of taxation, and protected the subject of every rank\r\n      against arbitrary interpretations, antiquated claims, and the\r\n      insolent vexation of the farmers of the revenue. 111 For it is\r\n      somewhat singular, that, in every age, the best and wisest of the\r\n      Roman governors persevered in this pernicious method of\r\n      collecting the principal branches at least of the excise and\r\n      customs. 112\r\n\r\n      110 (return) [ Tacit.

Inattentive, or\r\n      rather averse, to the welfare of his people, he found himself\r\n      under the necessity of gratifying the insatiate avarice which he\r\n      had excited in the army. Of the several impositions introduced by\r\n      Augustus, the twentieth on inheritances and legacies was the most\r\n      fruitful, as well as the most comprehensive. As its influence was\r\n      not confined to Rome or Italy, the produce continually increased\r\n      with the gradual extension of the Roman City. The new citizens,\r\n      though charged, on equal terms, 113 with the payment of new\r\n      taxes, which had not affected them as subjects, derived an ample\r\n      compensation from the rank they obtained, the privileges they\r\n      acquired, and the fair prospect of honors and fortune that was\r\n      thrown open to their ambition. But the favor which implied a\r\n      distinction was lost in the prodigality of Caracalla, and the\r\n      reluctant provincials were compelled to assume the vain title,\r\n      and the real obligations, of Roman citizens. 1131 Nor was the\r\n      rapacious son of Severus contented with such a measure of\r\n      taxation as had appeared sufficient to his moderate predecessors.\r\n      Instead of a twentieth, he exacted a tenth of all legacies and\r\n      inheritances; and during his reign (for the ancient proportion\r\n      was restored after his death) he crushed alike every part of the\r\n      empire under the weight of his iron sceptre. 114\r\n\r\n      113 (return) [ The situation of the new citizens is minutely\r\n      described by Pliny, (Panegyric, c. 37, 38, 39).

This\r\n      opinion may be disputed. Several passages of Spartianus, of\r\n      Aurelius Victor, and of Aristides, attribute this edict to Marc.\r\n      Aurelius. See a learned essay, entitled Joh. P. Mahneri Comm. de\r\n      Marc. Aur. Antonino Constitutionis de Civitate Universo Orbi\r\n      Romano data auctore. Halæ, 1772, 8vo. It appears that Marc.\r\n      Aurelius made some modifications of this edict, which released\r\n      the provincials from some of the charges imposed by the right of\r\n      the city, and deprived them of some of the advantages which it\r\n      conferred. Caracalla annulled these modifications.—W.]\r\n\r\n      114 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxvii. p. 1295.]\r\n\r\n      When all the provincials became liable to the peculiar\r\n      impositions of Roman citizens, they seemed to acquire a legal\r\n      exemption from the tributes which they had paid in their former\r\n      condition of subjects. Such were not the maxims of government\r\n      adopted by Caracalla and his pretended son. The old as well as\r\n      the new taxes were, at the same time, levied in the provinces. It\r\n      was reserved for the virtue of Alexander to relieve them in a\r\n      great measure from this intolerable grievance, by reducing the\r\n      tributes to a thirteenth part of the sum exacted at the time of\r\n      his accession. 115 It is impossible to conjecture the motive that\r\n      engaged him to spare so trifling a remnant of the public evil;\r\n      but the noxious weed, which had not been totally eradicated,\r\n      again sprang up with the most luxuriant growth, and in the\r\n      succeeding age darkened the Roman world with its deadly shade. In\r\n      the course of this history, we shall be too often summoned to\r\n      explain the land tax, the capitation, and the heavy contributions\r\n      of corn, wine, oil, and meat, which were exacted from the\r\n      provinces for the use of the court, the army, and the capital.\r\n\r\n      115 (return) [ He who paid ten aurei, the usual tribute, was\r\n      charged with no more than the third part of an aureus, and\r\n      proportional pieces of gold were coined by Alexander’s order.\r\n      Hist. August. p. 127, with the commentary of Salmasius.]\r\n\r\n      As long as Rome and Italy were respected as the centre of\r\n      government, a national spirit was preserved by the ancient, and\r\n      insensibly imbibed by the adopted, citizens. The principal\r\n      commands of the army were filled by men who had received a\r\n      liberal education, were well instructed in the advantages of laws\r\n      and letters, and who had risen, by equal steps, through the\r\n      regular succession of civil and military honors. 116 To their\r\n      influence and example we may partly ascribe the modest obedience\r\n      of the legions during the two first centuries of the Imperial\r\n      history.\r\n\r\n      116 (return) [ See the lives of Agricola, Vespasian, Trajan,\r\n      Severus, and his three competitors; and indeed of all the eminent\r\n      men of those times.]\r\n\r\n      But when the last enclosure of the Roman constitution was\r\n      trampled down by Caracalla, the separation of professions\r\n      gradually succeeded to the distinction of ranks. The more\r\n      polished citizens of the internal provinces were alone qualified\r\n      to act as lawyers and magistrates. The rougher trade of arms was\r\n      abandoned to the peasants and barbarians of the frontiers, who\r\n      knew no country but their camp, no science but that of war, no\r\n      civil laws, and scarcely those of military discipline. With\r\n      bloody hands, savage manners, and desperate resolutions, they\r\n      sometimes guarded, but much oftener subverted, the throne of the\r\n      emperors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter VII: Tyranny Of Maximin, Rebellion, Civil Wars, Death Of\r\n      Maximin.—Part I.\r\n\r\n     The Elevation And Tyranny Of Maximin.—Rebellion In Africa And\r\n     Italy, Under The Authority Of The Senate.—Civil Wars And\r\n     Seditions.—Violent Deaths Of Maximin And His Son, Of Maximus And\r\n     Balbinus, And Of The Three Gordians.— Usurpation And Secular Games\r\n     Of Philip.\r\n\r\n      Of the various forms of government which have prevailed in the\r\n      world, an hereditary monarchy seems to present the fairest scope\r\n      for ridicule. Is it possible to relate without an indignant\r\n      smile, that, on the father’s decease, the property of a nation,\r\n      like that of a drove of oxen, descends to his infant son, as yet\r\n      unknown to mankind and to himself; and that the bravest warriors\r\n      and the wisest statesmen, relinquishing their natural right to\r\n      empire, approach the royal cradle with bended knees and\r\n      protestations of inviolable fidelity? Satire and declamation may\r\n      paint these obvious topics in the most dazzling colors, but our\r\n      more serious thoughts will respect a useful prejudice, that\r\n      establishes a rule of succession, independent of the passions of\r\n      mankind; and we shall cheerfully acquiesce in any expedient which\r\n      deprives the multitude of the dangerous, and indeed the ideal,\r\n      power of giving themselves a master.\r\n\r\n      In the cool shade of retirement, we may easily devise imaginary\r\n      forms of government, in which the sceptre shall be constantly\r\n      bestowed on the most worthy, by the free and incorrupt suffrage\r\n      of the whole community. Experience overturns these airy fabrics,\r\n      and teaches us, that in a large society, the election of a\r\n      monarch can never devolve to the wisest, or to the most numerous\r\n      part of the people. The army is the only order of men\r\n      sufficiently united to concur in the same sentiments, and\r\n      powerful enough to impose them on the rest of their\r\n      fellow-citizens; but the temper of soldiers, habituated at once\r\n      to violence and to slavery, renders them very unfit guardians of\r\n      a legal, or even a civil constitution. Justice, humanity, or\r\n      political wisdom, are qualities they are too little acquainted\r\n      with in themselves, to appreciate them in others. Valor will\r\n      acquire their esteem, and liberality will purchase their\r\n      suffrage; but the first of these merits is often lodged in the\r\n      most savage breasts; the latter can only exert itself at the\r\n      expense of the public; and both may be turned against the\r\n      possessor of the throne, by the ambition of a daring rival.\r\n\r\n      The superior prerogative of birth, when it has obtained the\r\n      sanction of time and popular opinion, is the plainest and least\r\n      invidious of all distinctions among mankind. The acknowledged\r\n      right extinguishes the hopes of faction, and the conscious\r\n      security disarms the cruelty of the monarch. To the firm\r\n      establishment of this idea we owe the peaceful succession and\r\n      mild administration of European monarchies. To the defect of it\r\n      we must attribute the frequent civil wars, through which an\r\n      Asiatic despot is obliged to cut his way to the throne of his\r\n      fathers. Yet, even in the East, the sphere of contention is\r\n      usually limited to the princes of the reigning house, and as soon\r\n      as the more fortunate competitor has removed his brethren by the\r\n      sword and the bowstring, he no longer entertains any jealousy of\r\n      his meaner subjects. But the Roman empire, after the authority of\r\n      the senate had sunk into contempt, was a vast scene of confusion.\r\n      The royal, and even noble, families of the provinces had long\r\n      since been led in triumph before the car of the haughty\r\n      republicans. The ancient families of Rome had successively fallen\r\n      beneath the tyranny of the Cæsars; and whilst those princes were\r\n      shackled by the forms of a commonwealth, and disappointed by the\r\n      repeated failure of their posterity, 1 it was impossible that any\r\n      idea of hereditary succession should have taken root in the minds\r\n      of their subjects. The right to the throne, which none could\r\n      claim from birth, every one assumed from merit. The daring hopes\r\n      of ambition were set loose from the salutary restraints of law\r\n      and prejudice; and the meanest of mankind might, without folly,\r\n      entertain a hope of being raised by valor and fortune to a rank\r\n      in the army, in which a single crime would enable him to wrest\r\n      the sceptre of the world from his feeble and unpopular master.\r\n      After the murder of Alexander Severus, and the elevation of\r\n      Maximin, no emperor could think himself safe upon the throne, and\r\n      every barbarian peasant of the frontier might aspire to that\r\n      august, but dangerous station.\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ There had been no example of three successive\r\n      generations on the throne; only three instances of sons who\r\n      succeeded their fathers. The marriages of the Cæsars\r\n      (notwithstanding the permission, and the frequent practice of\r\n      divorces) were generally unfruitful.]\r\n\r\n      About thirty-two years before that event, the emperor Severus,\r\n      returning from an eastern expedition, halted in Thrace, to\r\n      celebrate, with military games, the birthday of his younger son,\r\n      Geta. The country flocked in crowds to behold their sovereign,\r\n      and a young barbarian of gigantic stature earnestly solicited, in\r\n      his rude dialect, that he might be allowed to contend for the\r\n      prize of wrestling. As the pride of discipline would have been\r\n      disgraced in the overthrow of a Roman soldier by a Thracian\r\n      peasant, he was matched with the stoutest followers of the camp,\r\n      sixteen of whom he successively laid on the ground. His victory\r\n      was rewarded by some trifling gifts, and a permission to enlist\r\n      in the troops. The next day, the happy barbarian was\r\n      distinguished above a crowd of recruits, dancing and exulting\r\n      after the fashion of his country. As soon as he perceived that he\r\n      had attracted the emperor’s notice, he instantly ran up to his\r\n      horse, and followed him on foot, without the least appearance of\r\n      fatigue, in a long and rapid career. “Thracian,” said Severus\r\n      with astonishment, “art thou disposed to wrestle after thy race?”\r\n      “Most willingly, sir,” replied the unwearied youth; and, almost\r\n      in a breath, overthrew seven of the strongest soldiers in the\r\n      army. A gold collar was the prize of his matchless vigor and\r\n      activity, and he was immediately appointed to serve in the\r\n      horseguards who always attended on the person of the sovereign. 2\r\n\r\n      2 (return) [ Hist. August p. 138.]\r\n\r\n      Maximin, for that was his name, though born on the territories of\r\n      the empire, descended from a mixed race of barbarians. His father\r\n      was a Goth, and his mother of the nation of the Alani. He\r\n      displayed on every occasion a valor equal to his strength; and\r\n      his native fierceness was soon tempered or disguised by the\r\n      knowledge of the world. Under the reign of Severus and his son,\r\n      he obtained the rank of centurion, with the favor and esteem of\r\n      both those princes, the former of whom was an excellent judge of\r\n      merit. Gratitude forbade Maximin to serve under the assassin of\r\n      Caracalla. Honor taught him to decline the effeminate insults of\r\n      Elagabalus. On the accession of Alexander he returned to court,\r\n      and was placed by that prince in a station useful to the service,\r\n      and honorable to himself. The fourth legion, to which he was\r\n      appointed tribune, soon became, under his care, the best\r\n      disciplined of the whole army. With the general applause of the\r\n      soldiers, who bestowed on their favorite hero the names of Ajax\r\n      and Hercules, he was successively promoted to the first military\r\n      command; 3 and had not he still retained too much of his savage\r\n      origin, the emperor might perhaps have given his own sister in\r\n      marriage to the son of Maximin. 4\r\n\r\n      3 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 140. Herodian, l. vi. p. 223.\r\n      Aurelius Victor. By comparing these authors, it should seem that\r\n      Maximin had the particular command of the Tribellian horse, with\r\n      the general commission of disciplining the recruits of the whole\r\n      army. His biographer ought to have marked, with more care, his\r\n      exploits, and the successive steps of his military promotions.]\r\n\r\n      4 (return) [ See the original letter of Alexander Severus, Hist.\r\n      August. p. 149.]\r\n\r\n      Instead of securing his fidelity, these favors served only to\r\n      inflame the ambition of the Thracian peasant, who deemed his\r\n      fortune inadequate to his merit, as long as he was constrained to\r\n      acknowledge a superior. Though a stranger to real wisdom, he was\r\n      not devoid of a selfish cunning, which showed him that the\r\n      emperor had lost the affection of the army, and taught him to\r\n      improve their discontent to his own advantage. It is easy for\r\n      faction and calumny to shed their poison on the administration of\r\n      the best of princes, and to accuse even their virtues by artfully\r\n      confounding them with those vices to which they bear the nearest\r\n      affinity. The troops listened with pleasure to the emissaries of\r\n      Maximin. They blushed at their own ignominious patience, which,\r\n      during thirteen years, had supported the vexatious discipline\r\n      imposed by an effeminate Syrian, the timid slave of his mother\r\n      and of the senate. It was time, they cried, to cast away that\r\n      useless phantom of the civil power, and to elect for their prince\r\n      and general a real soldier, educated in camps, exercised in war,\r\n      who would assert the glory, and distribute among his companions\r\n      the treasures, of the empire. A great army was at that time\r\n      assembled on the banks of the Rhine, under the command of the\r\n      emperor himself, who, almost immediately after his return from\r\n      the Persian war, had been obliged to march against the barbarians\r\n      of Germany. The important care of training and reviewing the new\r\n      levies was intrusted to Maximin. One day, as he entered the field\r\n      of exercise, the troops, either from a sudden impulse, or a\r\n      formed conspiracy, saluted him emperor, silenced by their loud\r\n      acclamations his obstinate refusal, and hastened to consummate\r\n      their rebellion by the murder of Alexander Severus.\r\n\r\n      The circumstances of his death are variously related. The\r\n      writers, who suppose that he died in ignorance of the ingratitude\r\n      and ambition of Maximin affirm that, after taking a frugal repast\r\n      in the sight of the army, he retired to sleep, and that, about\r\n      the seventh hour of the day, a part of his own guards broke into\r\n      the imperial tent, and, with many wounds, assassinated their\r\n      virtuous and unsuspecting prince. 5 If we credit another, and\r\n      indeed a more probable account, Maximin was invested with the\r\n      purple by a numerous detachment, at the distance of several miles\r\n      from the head-quarters; and he trusted for success rather to the\r\n      secret wishes than to the public declarations of the great army.\r\n      Alexander had sufficient time to awaken a faint sense of loyalty\r\n      among the troops; but their reluctant professions of fidelity\r\n      quickly vanished on the appearance of Maximin, who declared\r\n      himself the friend and advocate of the military order, and was\r\n      unanimously acknowledged emperor of the Romans by the applauding\r\n      legions. The son of Mamæa, betrayed and deserted, withdrew into\r\n      his tent, desirous at least to conceal his approaching fate from\r\n      the insults of the multitude. He was soon followed by a tribune\r\n      and some centurions, the ministers of death; but instead of\r\n      receiving with manly resolution the inevitable stroke, his\r\n      unavailing cries and entreaties disgraced the last moments of his\r\n      life, and converted into contempt some portion of the just pity\r\n      which his innocence and misfortunes must inspire. His mother,\r\n      Mamæa, whose pride and avarice he loudly accused as the cause of\r\n      his ruin, perished with her son. The most faithful of his friends\r\n      were sacrificed to the first fury of the soldiers. Others were\r\n      reserved for the more deliberate cruelty of the usurper; and\r\n      those who experienced the mildest treatment, were stripped of\r\n      their employments, and ignominiously driven from the court and\r\n      army. 6\r\n\r\n      5 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 135. I have softened some of the\r\n      most improbable circumstances of this wretched biographer. From\r\n      his ill-worded narration, it should seem that the prince’s\r\n      buffoon having accidentally entered the tent, and awakened the\r\n      slumbering monarch, the fear of punishment urged him to persuade\r\n      the disaffected soldiers to commit the murder.]\r\n\r\n      6 (return) [ Herodian, l. vi. 223-227.]\r\n\r\n      The former tyrants, Caligula and Nero, Commodus, and Caracalla,\r\n      were all dissolute and unexperienced youths, 7 educated in the\r\n      purple, and corrupted by the pride of empire, the luxury of Rome,\r\n      and the perfidious voice of flattery. The cruelty of Maximin was\r\n      derived from a different source, the fear of contempt. Though he\r\n      depended on the attachment of the soldiers, who loved him for\r\n      virtues like their own, he was conscious that his mean and\r\n      barbarian origin, his savage appearance, and his total ignorance\r\n      of the arts and institutions of civil life, 8 formed a very\r\n      unfavorable contrast with the amiable manners of the unhappy\r\n      Alexander. He remembered, that, in his humbler fortune, he had\r\n      often waited before the door of the haughty nobles of Rome, and\r\n      had been denied admittance by the insolence of their slaves. He\r\n      recollected too the friendship of a few who had relieved his\r\n      poverty, and assisted his rising hopes. But those who had\r\n      spurned, and those who had protected, the Thracian, were guilty\r\n      of the same crime, the knowledge of his original obscurity. For\r\n      this crime many were put to death; and by the execution of\r\n      several of his benefactors, Maximin published, in characters of\r\n      blood, the indelible history of his baseness and ingratitude. 9\r\n\r\n      7 (return) [ Caligula, the eldest of the four, was only\r\n      twenty-five years of age when he ascended the throne; Caracalla\r\n      was twenty-three, Commodus nineteen, and Nero no more than\r\n      seventeen.]\r\n\r\n      8 (return) [ It appears that he was totally ignorant of the Greek\r\n      language; which, from its universal use in conversation and\r\n      letters, was an essential part of every liberal education.]\r\n\r\n      9 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 141. Herodian, l. vii. p. 237. The\r\n      latter of these historians has been most unjustly censured for\r\n      sparing the vices of Maximin.]\r\n\r\n      The dark and sanguinary soul of the tyrant was open to every\r\n      suspicion against those among his subjects who were the most\r\n      distinguished by their birth or merit. Whenever he was alarmed\r\n      with the sound of treason, his cruelty was unbounded and\r\n      unrelenting. A conspiracy against his life was either discovered\r\n      or imagined, and Magnus, a consular senator, was named as the\r\n      principal author of it. Without a witness, without a trial, and\r\n      without an opportunity of defence, Magnus, with four thousand of\r\n      his supposed accomplices, was put to death. Italy and the whole\r\n      empire were infested with innumerable spies and informers. On the\r\n      slightest accusation, the first of the Roman nobles, who had\r\n      governed provinces, commanded armies, and been adorned with the\r\n      consular and triumphal ornaments, were chained on the public\r\n      carriages, and hurried away to the emperor’s presence.\r\n      Confiscation, exile, or simple death, were esteemed uncommon\r\n      instances of his lenity. Some of the unfortunate sufferers he\r\n      ordered to be sewed up in the hides of slaughtered animals,\r\n      others to be exposed to wild beasts, others again to be beaten to\r\n      death with clubs. During the three years of his reign, he\r\n      disdained to visit either Rome or Italy. His camp, occasionally\r\n      removed from the banks of the Rhine to those of the Danube, was\r\n      the seat of his stern despotism, which trampled on every\r\n      principle of law and justice, and was supported by the avowed\r\n      power of the sword. 10 No man of noble birth, elegant\r\n      accomplishments, or knowledge of civil business, was suffered\r\n      near his person; and the court of a Roman emperor revived the\r\n      idea of those ancient chiefs of slaves and gladiators, whose\r\n      savage power had left a deep impression of terror and\r\n      detestation. 11\r\n\r\n      10 (return) [ The wife of Maximin, by insinuating wise counsels\r\n      with female gentleness, sometimes brought back the tyrant to the\r\n      way of truth and humanity.

Hist.\r\n      August p. 141.]\r\n\r\n      As long as the cruelty of Maximin was confined to the illustrious\r\n      senators, or even to the bold adventurers, who in the court or\r\n      army expose themselves to the caprice of fortune, the body of the\r\n      people viewed their sufferings with indifference, or perhaps with\r\n      pleasure. But the tyrant’s avarice, stimulated by the insatiate\r\n      desires of the soldiers, at length attacked the public property.\r\n      Every city of the empire was possessed of an independent revenue,\r\n      destined to purchase corn for the multitude, and to supply the\r\n      expenses of the games and entertainments. By a single act of\r\n      authority, the whole mass of wealth was at once confiscated for\r\n      the use of the Imperial treasury. The temples were stripped of\r\n      their most valuable offerings of gold and silver, and the statues\r\n      of gods, heroes, and emperors, were melted down and coined into\r\n      money. These impious orders could not be executed without tumults\r\n      and massacres, as in many places the people chose rather to die\r\n      in the defence of their altars, than to behold in the midst of\r\n      peace their cities exposed to the rapine and cruelty of war. The\r\n      soldiers themselves, among whom this sacrilegious plunder was\r\n      distributed, received it with a blush; and hardened as they were\r\n      in acts of violence, they dreaded the just reproaches of their\r\n      friends and relations. Throughout the Roman world a general cry\r\n      of indignation was heard, imploring vengeance on the common enemy\r\n      of human kind; and at length, by an act of private oppression, a\r\n      peaceful and unarmed province was driven into rebellion against\r\n      him. 12\r\n\r\n      12 (return) [ Herodian, l. vii. p. 238. Zosim. l. i. p. 15.]\r\n\r\n      The procurator of Africa was a servant worthy of such a master,\r\n      who considered the fines and confiscations of the rich as one of\r\n      the most fruitful branches of the Imperial revenue. An iniquitous\r\n      sentence had been pronounced against some opulent youths of that\r\n      country, the execution of which would have stripped them of far\r\n      the greater part of their patrimony. In this extremity, a\r\n      resolution that must either complete or prevent their ruin, was\r\n      dictated by despair. A respite of three days, obtained with\r\n      difficulty from the rapacious treasurer, was employed in\r\n      collecting from their estates a great number of slaves and\r\n      peasants blindly devoted to the commands of their lords, and\r\n      armed with the rustic weapons of clubs and axes. The leaders of\r\n      the conspiracy, as they were admitted to the audience of the\r\n      procurator, stabbed him with the daggers concealed under their\r\n      garments, and, by the assistance of their tumultuary train,\r\n      seized on the little town of Thysdrus, 13 and erected the\r\n      standard of rebellion against the sovereign of the Roman empire.\r\n      They rested their hopes on the hatred of mankind against Maximin,\r\n      and they judiciously resolved to oppose to that detested tyrant\r\n      an emperor whose mild virtues had already acquired the love and\r\n      esteem of the Romans, and whose authority over the province would\r\n      give weight and stability to the enterprise. Gordianus, their\r\n      proconsul, and the object of their choice, refused, with\r\n      unfeigned reluctance, the dangerous honor, and begged with tears,\r\n      that they would suffer him to terminate in peace a long and\r\n      innocent life, without staining his feeble age with civil blood.\r\n      Their menaces compelled him to accept the Imperial purple, his\r\n      only refuge, indeed, against the jealous cruelty of Maximin;\r\n      since, according to the reasoning of tyrants, those who have been\r\n      esteemed worthy of the throne deserve death, and those who\r\n      deliberate have already rebelled. 14\r\n\r\n      13 (return) [ In the fertile territory of Byzacium, one hundred\r\n      and fifty miles to the south of Carthage.

August. p. 153.]\r\n\r\n      The family of Gordianus was one of the most illustrious of the\r\n      Roman senate. On the father’s side he was descended from the\r\n      Gracchi; on his mother’s, from the emperor Trajan. A great estate\r\n      enabled him to support the dignity of his birth, and in the\r\n      enjoyment of it, he displayed an elegant taste and beneficent\r\n      disposition. The palace in Rome, formerly inhabited by the great\r\n      Pompey, had been, during several generations, in the possession\r\n      of Gordian’s family. 15 It was distinguished by ancient trophies\r\n      of naval victories, and decorated with the works of modern\r\n      painting. His villa on the road to Præneste was celebrated for\r\n      baths of singular beauty and extent, for three stately rooms of a\r\n      hundred feet in length, and for a magnificent portico, supported\r\n      by two hundred columns of the four most curious and costly sorts\r\n      of marble. 16 The public shows exhibited at his expense, and in\r\n      which the people were entertained with many hundreds of wild\r\n      beasts and gladiators, 17 seem to surpass the fortune of a\r\n      subject; and whilst the liberality of other magistrates was\r\n      confined to a few solemn festivals at Rome, the magnificence of\r\n      Gordian was repeated, when he was ædile, every month in the year,\r\n      and extended, during his consulship, to the principal cities of\r\n      Italy. He was twice elevated to the last-mentioned dignity, by\r\n      Caracalla and by Alexander; for he possessed the uncommon talent\r\n      of acquiring the esteem of virtuous princes, without alarming the\r\n      jealousy of tyrants. His long life was innocently spent in the\r\n      study of letters and the peaceful honors of Rome; and, till he\r\n      was named proconsul of Africa by the voice of the senate and the\r\n      approbation of Alexander, 18 he appears prudently to have\r\n      declined the command of armies and the government of provinces.\r\n      181 As long as that emperor lived, Africa was happy under the\r\n      administration of his worthy representative: after the barbarous\r\n      Maximin had usurped the throne, Gordianus alleviated the miseries\r\n      which he was unable to prevent. When he reluctantly accepted the\r\n      purple, he was above fourscore years old; a last and valuable\r\n      remains of the happy age of the Antonines, whose virtues he\r\n      revived in his own conduct, and celebrated in an elegant poem of\r\n      thirty books. With the venerable proconsul, his son, who had\r\n      accompanied him into Africa as his lieutenant, was likewise\r\n      declared emperor. His manners were less pure, but his character\r\n      was equally amiable with that of his father. Twenty-two\r\n      acknowledged concubines, and a library of sixty-two thousand\r\n      volumes, attested the variety of his inclinations; and from the\r\n      productions which he left behind him, it appears that the former\r\n      as well as the latter were designed for use rather than for\r\n      ostentation. 19 The Roman people acknowledged in the features of\r\n      the younger Gordian the resemblance of Scipio Africanus, 191\r\n      recollected with pleasure that his mother was the granddaughter\r\n      of Antoninus Pius, and rested the public hope on those latent\r\n      virtues which had hitherto, as they fondly imagined, lain\r\n      concealed in the luxurious indolence of private life.\r\n\r\n      15 (return) [ Hist.

But these vain acclamations\r\n      neither strengthened nor confirmed the title of the Gordians.\r\n      They were induced by principle, as well as interest, to solicit\r\n      the approbation of the senate; and a deputation of the noblest\r\n      provincials was sent, without delay, to Rome, to relate and\r\n      justify the conduct of their countrymen, who, having long\r\n      suffered with patience, were at length resolved to act with\r\n      vigor. The letters of the new princes were modest and respectful,\r\n      excusing the necessity which had obliged them to accept the\r\n      Imperial title; but submitting their election and their fate to\r\n      the supreme judgment of the senate. 20\r\n\r\n      20 (return) [ Herodian, l. vii. p. 243.

Their\r\n      fortune had created many dependants in that assembly, their merit\r\n      had acquired many friends. Their mild administration opened the\r\n      flattering prospect of the restoration, not only of the civil but\r\n      even of the republican government. The terror of military\r\n      violence, which had first obliged the senate to forget the murder\r\n      of Alexander, and to ratify the election of a barbarian peasant,\r\n      21 now produced a contrary effect, and provoked them to assert\r\n      the injured rights of freedom and humanity. The hatred of Maximin\r\n      towards the senate was declared and implacable; the tamest\r\n      submission had not appeased his fury, the most cautious innocence\r\n      would not remove his suspicions; and even the care of their own\r\n      safety urged them to share the fortune of an enterprise, of which\r\n      (if unsuccessful) they were sure to be the first victims. These\r\n      considerations, and perhaps others of a more private nature, were\r\n      debated in a previous conference of the consuls and the\r\n      magistrates. As soon as their resolution was decided, they\r\n      convoked in the temple of Castor the whole body of the senate,\r\n      according to an ancient form of secrecy, 22 calculated to awaken\r\n      their attention, and to conceal their decrees. “Conscript\r\n      fathers,” said the consul Syllanus, “the two Gordians, both of\r\n      consular dignity, the one your proconsul, the other your\r\n      lieutenant, have been declared emperors by the general consent of\r\n      Africa. Let us return thanks,” he boldly continued, “to the youth\r\n      of Thysdrus; let us return thanks to the faithful people of\r\n      Carthage, our generous deliverers from a horrid monster—Why do\r\n      you hear me thus coolly, thus timidly? Why do you cast those\r\n      anxious looks on each other? Why hesitate? Maximin is a public\r\n      enemy! may his enmity soon expire with him, and may we long enjoy\r\n      the prudence and felicity of Gordian the father, the valor and\r\n      constancy of Gordian the son!” 23 The noble ardor of the consul\r\n      revived the languid spirit of the senate. By a unanimous decree,\r\n      the election of the Gordians was ratified, Maximin, his son, and\r\n      his adherents, were pronounced enemies of their country, and\r\n      liberal rewards were offered to whomsoever had the courage and\r\n      good fortune to destroy them.\r\n\r\n      21 (return) [ Quod. tamen patres dum periculosum existimant;\r\n      inermes armato esistere approbaverunt.—Aurelius Victor.]\r\n\r\n      22 (return) [ Even the servants of the house, the scribes, &c.,\r\n      were excluded, and their office was filled by the senators\r\n      themselves.

The præfect Vitalianus had signalized his fidelity to\r\n      Maximin, by the alacrity with which he had obeyed, and even\r\n      prevented the cruel mandates of the tyrant. His death alone could\r\n      rescue the authority of the senate, and the lives of the senators\r\n      from a state of danger and suspense.

The enthusiasm of liberty was\r\n      seconded by the promise of a large donative, in lands and money;\r\n      the statues of Maximin were thrown down; the capital of the\r\n      empire acknowledged, with transport, the authority of the two\r\n      Gordians and the senate; 24 and the example of Rome was followed\r\n      by the rest of Italy.\r\n\r\n      24 (return) [ Herodian, l. vii. p. 244]\r\n\r\n      A new spirit had arisen in that assembly, whose long patience had\r\n      been insulted by wanton despotism and military license. The\r\n      senate assumed the reins of government, and, with a calm\r\n      intrepidity, prepared to vindicate by arms the cause of freedom.\r\n      Among the consular senators recommended by their merit and\r\n      services to the favor of the emperor Alexander, it was easy to\r\n      select twenty, not unequal to the command of an army, and the\r\n      conduct of a war. To these was the defence of Italy intrusted.\r\n      Each was appointed to act in his respective department,\r\n      authorized to enroll and discipline the Italian youth; and\r\n      instructed to fortify the ports and highways, against the\r\n      impending invasion of Maximin. A number of deputies, chosen from\r\n      the most illustrious of the senatorian and equestrian orders,\r\n      were despatched at the same time to the governors of the several\r\n      provinces, earnestly conjuring them to fly to the assistance of\r\n      their country, and to remind the nations of their ancient ties of\r\n      friendship with the Roman senate and people. The general respect\r\n      with which these deputies were received, and the zeal of Italy\r\n      and the provinces in favor of the senate, sufficiently prove that\r\n      the subjects of Maximin were reduced to that uncommon distress,\r\n      in which the body of the people has more to fear from oppression\r\n      than from resistance. The consciousness of that melancholy truth,\r\n      inspires a degree of persevering fury, seldom to be found in\r\n      those civil wars which are artificially supported for the benefit\r\n      of a few factious and designing leaders. 25\r\n\r\n      25 (return) [ Herodian, l. vii. p. 247, l. viii. p. 277.

The feeble\r\n      court of Carthage was alarmed by the rapid approach of\r\n      Capelianus, governor of Mauritania, who, with a small band of\r\n      veterans, and a fierce host of barbarians, attacked a faithful,\r\n      but unwarlike province. The younger Gordian sallied out to meet\r\n      the enemy at the head of a few guards, and a numerous\r\n      undisciplined multitude, educated in the peaceful luxury of\r\n      Carthage. His useless valor served only to procure him an\r\n      honorable death on the field of battle. His aged father, whose\r\n      reign had not exceeded thirty-six days, put an end to his life on\r\n      the first news of the defeat. Carthage, destitute of defence,\r\n      opened her gates to the conqueror, and Africa was exposed to the\r\n      rapacious cruelty of a slave, obliged to satisfy his unrelenting\r\n      master with a large account of blood and treasure. 26\r\n\r\n      26 (return) [ Herodian, l. vii. p. 254.

A silent consternation prevailed in the\r\n      assembly, till a senator, of the name and family of Trajan,\r\n      awakened his brethren from their fatal lethargy. He represented\r\n      to them that the choice of cautious, dilatory measures had been\r\n      long since out of their power; that Maximin, implacable by\r\n      nature, and exasperated by injuries, was advancing towards Italy,\r\n      at the head of the military force of the empire; and that their\r\n      only remaining alternative was either to meet him bravely in the\r\n      field, or tamely to expect the tortures and ignominious death\r\n      reserved for unsuccessful rebellion. “We have lost,” continued\r\n      he, “two excellent princes; but unless we desert ourselves, the\r\n      hopes of the republic have not perished with the Gordians. Many\r\n      are the senators whose virtues have deserved, and whose abilities\r\n      would sustain, the Imperial dignity.

The various nature of their\r\n      talents seemed to appropriate to each his peculiar department of\r\n      peace and war, without leaving room for jealous emulation.\r\n      Balbinus was an admired orator, a poet of distinguished fame, and\r\n      a wise magistrate, who had exercised with innocence and applause\r\n      the civil jurisdiction in almost all the interior provinces of\r\n      the empire. His birth was noble, 28 his fortune affluent, his\r\n      manners liberal and affable. In him the love of pleasure was\r\n      corrected by a sense of dignity, nor had the habits of ease\r\n      deprived him of a capacity for business. The mind of Maximus was\r\n      formed in a rougher mould. By his valor and abilities he had\r\n      raised himself from the meanest origin to the first employments\r\n      of the state and army. His victories over the Sarmatians and the\r\n      Germans, the austerity of his life, and the rigid impartiality of\r\n      his justice, while he was a Præfect of the city, commanded the\r\n      esteem of a people whose affections were engaged in favor of the\r\n      more amiable Balbinus. The two colleagues had both been consuls,\r\n      (Balbinus had twice enjoyed that honorable office,) both had been\r\n      named among the twenty lieutenants of the senate; and since the\r\n      one was sixty and the other seventy-four years old, 29 they had\r\n      both attained the full maturity of age and experience.\r\n\r\n      28 (return) [ He was descended from Cornelius Balbus, a noble\r\n      Spaniard, and the adopted son of Theophanes, the Greek historian.\r\n      Balbus obtained the freedom of Rome by the favor of Pompey, and\r\n      preserved it by the eloquence of Cicero.

The licentious multitude\r\n      neither loved the rigid Maximus, nor did they sufficiently fear\r\n      the mild and humane Balbinus. Their increasing numbers surrounded\r\n      the temple of Jupiter; with obstinate clamors they asserted their\r\n      inherent right of consenting to the election of their sovereign;\r\n      and demanded, with an apparent moderation, that, besides the two\r\n      emperors, chosen by the senate, a third should be added of the\r\n      family of the Gordians, as a just return of gratitude to those\r\n      princes who had sacrificed their lives for the republic. At the\r\n      head of the city-guards, and the youth of the equestrian order,\r\n      Maximus and Balbinus attempted to cut their way through the\r\n      seditious multitude.

It is prudent to yield when the\r\n      contest, whatever may be the issue of it, must be fatal to both\r\n      parties. A boy, only thirteen years of age, the grandson of the\r\n      elder, and nephew 301 of the younger Gordian, was produced to the\r\n      people, invested with the ornaments and title of Cæsar. The\r\n      tumult was appeased by this easy condescension; and the two\r\n      emperors, as soon as they had been peaceably acknowledged in\r\n      Rome, prepared to defend Italy against the common enemy.\r\n\r\n      30 (return) [ Herodian, l. vii. p. 256, supposes that the senate\r\n      was at first convoked in the Capitol, and is very eloquent on the\r\n      occasion.

He is said to have received the news\r\n      of the rebellion of the Gordians, and of the decree of the senate\r\n      against him, not with the temper of a man, but the rage of a wild\r\n      beast; which, as it could not discharge itself on the distant\r\n      senate, threatened the life of his son, of his friends, and of\r\n      all who ventured to approach his person. The grateful\r\n      intelligence of the death of the Gordians was quickly followed by\r\n      the assurance that the senate, laying aside all hopes of pardon\r\n      or accommodation, had substituted in their room two emperors,\r\n      with whose merit he could not be unacquainted. Revenge was the\r\n      only consolation left to Maximin, and revenge could only be\r\n      obtained by arms. The strength of the legions had been assembled\r\n      by Alexander from all parts of the empire. Three successful\r\n      campaigns against the Germans and the Sarmatians, had raised\r\n      their fame, confirmed their discipline, and even increased their\r\n      numbers, by filling the ranks with the flower of the barbarian\r\n      youth. The life of Maximin had been spent in war, and the candid\r\n      severity of history cannot refuse him the valor of a soldier, or\r\n      even the abilities of an experienced general. 31 It might\r\n      naturally be expected, that a prince of such a character, instead\r\n      of suffering the rebellion to gain stability by delay, should\r\n      immediately have marched from the banks of the Danube to those of\r\n      the Tyber, and that his victorious army, instigated by contempt\r\n      for the senate, and eager to gather the spoils of Italy, should\r\n      have burned with impatience to finish the easy and lucrative\r\n      conquest. Yet as far as we can trust to the obscure chronology of\r\n      that period, 32 it appears that the operations of some foreign\r\n      war deferred the Italian expedition till the ensuing spring. From\r\n      the prudent conduct of Maximin, we may learn that the savage\r\n      features of his character have been exaggerated by the pencil of\r\n      party, that his passions, however impetuous, submitted to the\r\n      force of reason, and that the barbarian possessed something of\r\n      the generous spirit of Sylla, who subdued the enemies of Rome\r\n      before he suffered himself to revenge his private injuries. 33\r\n\r\n      31 (return) [ In Herodian, l. vii. p. 249, and in the Augustan\r\n      History, we have three several orations of Maximin to his army,\r\n      on the rebellion of Africa and Rome: M. de Tillemont has very\r\n      justly observed that they neither agree with each other nor with\r\n      truth.

Setting aside\r\n      all the historians, whose contradictions are irreconcilable, he\r\n      has only consulted the medals, and has arranged the events before\r\n      us in the following order:— Maximin, A. U. 990, after having\r\n      conquered the Germans, reenters Pannonia, establishes his winter\r\n      quarters at Sirmium, and prepares himself to make war against the\r\n      people of the North. In the year 991, in the cal ends of January,\r\n      commences his fourth tribunate. The Gordians are chosen emperors\r\n      in Africa, probably at the beginning of the month of March. The\r\n      senate confirms this election with joy, and declares Maximin the\r\n      enemy of Rome. Five days after he had heard of this revolt,\r\n      Maximin sets out from Sirmium on his march to Italy. These events\r\n      took place about the beginning of April; a little after, the\r\n      Gordians are slain in Africa by Capellianus, procurator of\r\n      Mauritania. The senate, in its alarm, names as emperors Balbus\r\n      and Maximus Pupianus, and intrusts the latter with the war\r\n      against Maximin. Maximin is stopped on his road near Aquileia, by\r\n      the want of provisions, and by the melting of the snows: he\r\n      begins the siege of Aquileia at the end of April. Pupianus\r\n      assembles his army at Ravenna. Maximin and his son are\r\n      assassinated by the soldiers enraged at the resistance of\r\n      Aquileia: and this was probably in the middle of May.

Such had been the wise orders of the generals of the\r\n      senate: whose design was to protract the war, to ruin the army of\r\n      Maximin by the slow operation of famine, and to consume his\r\n      strength in the sieges of the principal cities of Italy, which\r\n      they had plentifully stored with men and provisions from the\r\n      deserted country. Aquileia received and withstood the first shock\r\n      of the invasion. The streams that issue from the head of the\r\n      Hadriatic Gulf, swelled by the melting of the winter snows, 34\r\n      opposed an unexpected obstacle to the arms of Maximin. At length,\r\n      on a singular bridge, constructed with art and difficulty, of\r\n      large hogsheads, he transported his army to the opposite bank,\r\n      rooted up the beautiful vineyards in the neighborhood of\r\n      Aquileia, demolished the suburbs, and employed the timber of the\r\n      buildings in the engines and towers, with which on every side he\r\n      attacked the city. The walls, fallen to decay during the security\r\n      of a long peace, had been hastily repaired on this sudden\r\n      emergency: but the firmest defence of Aquileia consisted in the\r\n      constancy of the citizens; all ranks of whom, instead of being\r\n      dismayed, were animated by the extreme danger, and their\r\n      knowledge of the tyrant’s unrelenting temper. Their courage was\r\n      supported and directed by Crispinus and Menophilus, two of the\r\n      twenty lieutenants of the senate, who, with a small body of\r\n      regular troops, had thrown themselves into the besieged place.\r\n      The army of Maximin was repulsed in repeated attacks, his\r\n      machines destroyed by showers of artificial fire; and the\r\n      generous enthusiasm of the Aquileians was exalted into a\r\n      confidence of success, by the opinion that Belenus, their tutelar\r\n      deity, combated in person in the defence of his distressed\r\n      worshippers. 35\r\n\r\n      34 (return) [ Muratori (Annali d’ Italia, tom. ii. p. 294) thinks\r\n      the melting of the snows suits better with the months of June or\r\n      July, than with those of February.

A temple was likewise built to Venus the Bald, in\r\n      honor of the women of Aquileia, who had given up their hair to\r\n      make ropes for the military engines.]\r\n\r\n      The emperor Maximus, who had advanced as far as Ravenna, to\r\n      secure that important place, and to hasten the military\r\n      preparations, beheld the event of the war in the more faithful\r\n      mirror of reason and policy. He was too sensible, that a single\r\n      town could not resist the persevering efforts of a great army;\r\n      and he dreaded, lest the enemy, tired with the obstinate\r\n      resistance of Aquileia, should on a sudden relinquish the\r\n      fruitless siege, and march directly towards Rome. The fate of the\r\n      empire and the cause of freedom must then be committed to the\r\n      chance of a battle; and what arms could he oppose to the veteran\r\n      legions of the Rhine and Danube? Some troops newly levied among\r\n      the generous but enervated youth of Italy; and a body of German\r\n      auxiliaries, on whose firmness, in the hour of trial, it was\r\n      dangerous to depend. In the midst of these just alarms, the\r\n      stroke of domestic conspiracy punished the crimes of Maximin, and\r\n      delivered Rome and the senate from the calamities that would\r\n      surely have attended the victory of an enraged barbarian.\r\n\r\n      The people of Aquileia had scarcely experienced any of the common\r\n      miseries of a siege; their magazines were plentifully supplied,\r\n      and several fountains within the walls assured them of an\r\n      inexhaustible resource of fresh water. The soldiers of Maximin\r\n      were, on the contrary, exposed to the inclemency of the season,\r\n      the contagion of disease, and the horrors of famine. The open\r\n      country was ruined, the rivers filled with the slain, and\r\n      polluted with blood. A spirit of despair and disaffection began\r\n      to diffuse itself among the troops; and as they were cut off from\r\n      all intelligence, they easily believed that the whole empire had\r\n      embraced the cause of the senate, and that they were left as\r\n      devoted victims to perish under the impregnable walls of\r\n      Aquileia. The fierce temper of the tyrant was exasperated by\r\n      disappointments, which he imputed to the cowardice of his army;\r\n      and his wanton and ill-timed cruelty, instead of striking terror,\r\n      inspired hatred, and a just desire of revenge. A party of\r\n      Prætorian guards, who trembled for their wives and children in\r\n      the camp of Alba, near Rome, executed the sentence of the senate.\r\n      Maximin, abandoned by his guards, was slain in his tent, with his\r\n      son (whom he had associated to the honors of the purple),\r\n      Anulinus the præfect, and the principal ministers of his tyranny.\r\n      36 The sight of their heads, borne on the point of spears,\r\n      convinced the citizens of Aquileia that the siege was at an end;\r\n      the gates of the city were thrown open, a liberal market was\r\n      provided for the hungry troops of Maximin, and the whole army\r\n      joined in solemn protestations of fidelity to the senate and the\r\n      people of Rome, and to their lawful emperors Maximus and\r\n      Balbinus. Such was the deserved fate of a brutal savage,\r\n      destitute, as he has generally been represented, of every\r\n      sentiment that distinguishes a civilized, or even a human being.\r\n      The body was suited to the soul. The stature of Maximin exceeded\r\n      the measure of eight feet, and circumstances almost incredible\r\n      are related of his matchless strength and appetite. 37 Had he\r\n      lived in a less enlightened age, tradition and poetry might well\r\n      have described him as one of those monstrous giants, whose\r\n      supernatural power was constantly exerted for the destruction of\r\n      mankind.\r\n\r\n      36 (return) [ Herodian, l. viii. p. 279.

He could move a loaded wagon, break a horse’s leg\r\n      with his fist, crumble stones in his hand, and tear up small\r\n      trees by the roots. See his life in the Augustan History.]\r\n\r\n      It is easier to conceive than to describe the universal joy of\r\n      the Roman world on the fall of the tyrant, the news of which is\r\n      said to have been carried in four days from Aquileia to Rome. The\r\n      return of Maximus was a triumphal procession; his colleague and\r\n      young Gordian went out to meet him, and the three princes made\r\n      their entry into the capital, attended by the ambassadors of\r\n      almost all the cities of Italy, saluted with the splendid\r\n      offerings of gratitude and superstition, and received with the\r\n      unfeigned acclamations of the senate and people, who persuaded\r\n      themselves that a golden age would succeed to an age of iron. 38\r\n      The conduct of the two emperors corresponded with these\r\n      expectations. They administered justice in person; and the rigor\r\n      of the one was tempered by the other’s clemency. The oppressive\r\n      taxes with which Maximin had loaded the rights of inheritance and\r\n      succession, were repealed, or at least moderated. Discipline was\r\n      revived, and with the advice of the senate many wise laws were\r\n      enacted by their imperial ministers, who endeavored to restore a\r\n      civil constitution on the ruins of military tyranny. “What reward\r\n      may we expect for delivering Rome from a monster?” was the\r\n      question asked by Maximus, in a moment of freedom and confidence.\r\n\r\n      Balbinus answered it without hesitation—“The love of the senate,\r\n      of the people, and of all mankind.” “Alas!” replied his more\r\n      penetrating colleague—“alas! I dread the hatred of the soldiers,\r\n      and the fatal effects of their resentment.” 39 His apprehensions\r\n      were but too well justified by the event.\r\n\r\n      38 (return) [ See the congratulatory letter of Claudius Julianus,\r\n      the consul to the two emperors, in the Augustan History.]\r\n\r\n      39 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 171.]\r\n\r\n      Whilst Maximus was preparing to defend Italy against the common\r\n      foe, Balbinus, who remained at Rome, had been engaged in scenes\r\n      of blood and intestine discord. Distrust and jealousy reigned in\r\n      the senate; and even in the temples where they assembled, every\r\n      senator carried either open or concealed arms. In the midst of\r\n      their deliberations, two veterans of the guards, actuated either\r\n      by curiosity or a sinister motive, audaciously thrust themselves\r\n      into the house, and advanced by degrees beyond the altar of\r\n      Victory. Gallicanus, a consular, and Mæcenas, a Prætorian\r\n      senator, viewed with indignation their insolent intrusion:\r\n      drawing their daggers, they laid the spies (for such they deemed\r\n      them) dead at the foot of the altar, and then, advancing to the\r\n      door of the senate, imprudently exhorted the multitude to\r\n      massacre the Prætorians, as the secret adherents of the tyrant.\r\n      Those who escaped the first fury of the tumult took refuge in the\r\n      camp, which they defended with superior advantage against the\r\n      reiterated attacks of the people, assisted by the numerous bands\r\n      of gladiators, the property of opulent nobles. The civil war\r\n      lasted many days, with infinite loss and confusion on both sides.\r\n      When the pipes were broken that supplied the camp with water, the\r\n      Prætorians were reduced to intolerable distress; but in their\r\n      turn they made desperate sallies into the city, set fire to a\r\n      great number of houses, and filled the streets with the blood of\r\n      the inhabitants. The emperor Balbinus attempted, by ineffectual\r\n      edicts and precarious truces, to reconcile the factions at Rome.\r\n      But their animosity, though smothered for a while, burnt with\r\n      redoubled violence. The soldiers, detesting the senate and the\r\n      people, despised the weakness of a prince, who wanted either the\r\n      spirit or the power to command the obedience of his subjects. 40\r\n\r\n      40 (return) [ Herodian, l. viii. p. 258.]\r\n\r\n      After the tyrant’s death, his formidable army had acknowledged,\r\n      from necessity rather than from choice, the authority of Maximus,\r\n      who transported himself without delay to the camp before\r\n      Aquileia. As soon as he had received their oath of fidelity, he\r\n      addressed them in terms full of mildness and moderation;\r\n      lamented, rather than arraigned the wild disorders of the times,\r\n      and assured the soldiers, that of all their past conduct the\r\n      senate would remember only their generous desertion of the\r\n      tyrant, and their voluntary return to their duty. Maximus\r\n      enforced his exhortations by a liberal donative, purified the\r\n      camp by a solemn sacrifice of expiation, and then dismissed the\r\n      legions to their several provinces, impressed, as he hoped, with\r\n      a lively sense of gratitude and obedience. 41 But nothing could\r\n      reconcile the haughty spirit of the Prætorians. They attended the\r\n      emperors on the memorable day of their public entry into Rome;\r\n      but amidst the general acclamations, the sullen, dejected\r\n      countenance of the guards sufficiently declared that they\r\n      considered themselves as the object, rather than the partners, of\r\n      the triumph. When the whole body was united in their camp, those\r\n      who had served under Maximin, and those who had remained at Rome,\r\n      insensibly communicated to each other their complaints and\r\n      apprehensions. The emperors chosen by the army had perished with\r\n      ignominy; those elected by the senate were seated on the throne.\r\n      42 The long discord between the civil and military powers was\r\n      decided by a war, in which the former had obtained a complete\r\n      victory. The soldiers must now learn a new doctrine of submission\r\n      to the senate; and whatever clemency was affected by that politic\r\n      assembly, they dreaded a slow revenge, colored by the name of\r\n      discipline, and justified by fair pretences of the public good.\r\n      But their fate was still in their own hands; and if they had\r\n      courage to despise the vain terrors of an impotent republic, it\r\n      was easy to convince the world, that those who were masters of\r\n      the arms, were masters of the authority, of the state.\r\n\r\n      41 (return) [ Herodian, l. viii. p. 213.]\r\n\r\n      42 (return) [ The observation had been made imprudently enough in\r\n      the acclamations of the senate, and with regard to the soldiers\r\n      it carried the appearance of a wanton insult. Hist. August. p.\r\n      170.]\r\n\r\n      When the senate elected two princes, it is probable that, besides\r\n      the declared reason of providing for the various emergencies of\r\n      peace and war, they were actuated by the secret desire of\r\n      weakening by division the despotism of the supreme magistrate.\r\n      Their policy was effectual, but it proved fatal both to their\r\n      emperors and to themselves. The jealousy of power was soon\r\n      exasperated by the difference of character. Maximus despised\r\n      Balbinus as a luxurious noble, and was in his turn disdained by\r\n      his colleague as an obscure soldier. Their silent discord was\r\n      understood rather than seen; 43 but the mutual consciousness\r\n      prevented them from uniting in any vigorous measures of defence\r\n      against their common enemies of the Prætorian camp. The whole\r\n      city was employed in the Capitoline games, and the emperors were\r\n      left almost alone in the palace. On a sudden, they were alarmed\r\n      by the approach of a troop of desperate assassins. Ignorant of\r\n      each other’s situation or designs (for they already occupied very\r\n      distant apartments), afraid to give or to receive assistance,\r\n      they wasted the important moments in idle debates and fruitless\r\n      recriminations. The arrival of the guards put an end to the vain\r\n      strife. They seized on these emperors of the senate, for such\r\n      they called them with malicious contempt, stripped them of their\r\n      garments, and dragged them in insolent triumph through the\r\n      streets of Rome, with the design of inflicting a slow and cruel\r\n      death on these unfortunate princes. The fear of a rescue from the\r\n      faithful Germans of the Imperial guards shortened their tortures;\r\n      and their bodies, mangled with a thousand wounds, were left\r\n      exposed to the insults or to the pity of the populace. 44\r\n\r\n      43 (return) [ Discordiæ tacitæ, et quæ intelligerentur potius\r\n      quam viderentur. _Hist.

Gordian, who had already received the title of Cæsar, was\r\n      the only person that occurred to the soldiers as proper to fill\r\n      the vacant throne. 45 They carried him to the camp, and\r\n      unanimously saluted him Augustus and Emperor. His name was dear\r\n      to the senate and people; his tender age promised a long impunity\r\n      of military license; and the submission of Rome and the provinces\r\n      to the choice of the Prætorian guards saved the republic, at the\r\n      expense indeed of its freedom and dignity, from the horrors of a\r\n      new civil war in the heart of the capital. 46\r\n\r\n      45 (return) [ Quia non alius erat in præsenti, is the expression\r\n      of the Augustan History.]\r\n\r\n      46 (return) [ Quintus Curtius (l. x. c. 9,) pays an elegant\r\n      compliment to the emperor of the day, for having, by his happy\r\n      accession, extinguished so many firebrands, sheathed so many\r\n      swords, and put an end to the evils of a divided government.\r\n      After weighing with attention every word of the passage, I am of\r\n      opinion, that it suits better with the elevation of Gordian, than\r\n      with any other period of the Roman history. In that case, it may\r\n      serve to decide the age of Quintus Curtius. Those who place him\r\n      under the first Cæsars, argue from the purity of his style but\r\n      are embarrassed by the silence of Quintilian, in his accurate\r\n      list of Roman historians. * Note: This conjecture of Gibbon is\r\n      without foundation. Many passages in the work of Quintus Curtius\r\n      clearly place him at an earlier period. Thus, in speaking of the\r\n      Parthians, he says, Hinc in Parthicum perventum est, tunc\r\n      ignobilem gentem: nunc caput omnium qui post Euphratem et Tigrim\r\n      amnes siti Rubro mari terminantur. The Parthian empire had this\r\n      extent only in the first age of the vulgar æra: to that age,\r\n      therefore, must be assigned the date of Quintus Curtius. Although\r\n      the critics (says M. de Sainte Croix) have multiplied conjectures\r\n      on this subject, most of them have ended by adopting the opinion\r\n      which places Quintus Curtius under the reign of Claudius.

Immediately after his accession, he fell\r\n      into the hands of his mother’s eunuchs, that pernicious vermin of\r\n      the East, who, since the days of Elagabalus, had infested the\r\n      Roman palace. By the artful conspiracy of these wretches, an\r\n      impenetrable veil was drawn between an innocent prince and his\r\n      oppressed subjects, the virtuous disposition of Gordian was\r\n      deceived, and the honors of the empire sold without his\r\n      knowledge, though in a very public manner, to the most worthless\r\n      of mankind. We are ignorant by what fortunate accident the\r\n      emperor escaped from this ignominious slavery, and devolved his\r\n      confidence on a minister, whose wise counsels had no object\r\n      except the glory of his sovereign and the happiness of the\r\n      people. It should seem that love and learning introduced\r\n      Misitheus to the favor of Gordian. The young prince married the\r\n      daughter of his master of rhetoric, and promoted his\r\n      father-in-law to the first offices of the empire. Two admirable\r\n      letters that passed between them are still extant. The minister,\r\n      with the conscious dignity of virtue, congratulates Gordian that\r\n      he is delivered from the tyranny of the eunuchs, 47 and still\r\n      more that he is sensible of his deliverance. The emperor\r\n      acknowledges, with an amiable confusion, the errors of his past\r\n      conduct; and laments, with singular propriety, the misfortune of\r\n      a monarch from whom a venal tribe of courtiers perpetually labor\r\n      to conceal the truth. 48\r\n\r\n      47 (return) [ Hist.

From some hints in the two\r\n      letters, I should expect that the eunuchs were not expelled the\r\n      palace without some degree of gentle violence, and that the young\r\n      Gordian rather approved of, than consented to, their disgrace.]\r\n\r\n      48 (return) [ Duxit uxorem filiam Misithei, quem causa eloquentiæ\r\n      dignum parentela sua putavit; et præfectum statim fecit; post\r\n      quod, non puerile jam et contemptibile videbatur imperium.]\r\n\r\n      The life of Misitheus had been spent in the profession of\r\n      letters, not of arms; yet such was the versatile genius of that\r\n      great man, that, when he was appointed Prætorian Præfect, he\r\n      discharged the military duties of his place with vigor and\r\n      ability. The Persians had invaded Mesopotamia, and threatened\r\n      Antioch. By the persuasion of his father-in-law, the young\r\n      emperor quitted the luxury of Rome, opened, for the last time\r\n      recorded in history, the temple of Janus, and marched in person\r\n      into the East. On his approach, with a great army, the Persians\r\n      withdrew their garrisons from the cities which they had already\r\n      taken, and retired from the Euphrates to the Tigris. Gordian\r\n      enjoyed the pleasure of announcing to the senate the first\r\n      success of his arms, which he ascribed, with a becoming modesty\r\n      and gratitude, to the wisdom of his father and Præfect. During\r\n      the whole expedition, Misitheus watched over the safety and\r\n      discipline of the army; whilst he prevented their dangerous\r\n      murmurs by maintaining a regular plenty in the camp, and by\r\n      establishing ample magazines of vinegar, bacon, straw, barley,\r\n      and wheat in all the cities of the frontier. 49 But the\r\n      prosperity of Gordian expired with Misitheus, who died of a flux,\r\n      not without very strong suspicions of poison. Philip, his\r\n      successor in the præfecture, was an Arab by birth, and\r\n      consequently, in the earlier part of his life, a robber by\r\n      profession. His rise from so obscure a station to the first\r\n      dignities of the empire, seems to prove that he was a bold and\r\n      able leader. But his boldness prompted him to aspire to the\r\n      throne, and his abilities were employed to supplant, not to\r\n      serve, his indulgent master. The minds of the soldiers were\r\n      irritated by an artificial scarcity, created by his contrivance\r\n      in the camp; and the distress of the army was attributed to the\r\n      youth and incapacity of the prince. It is not in our power to\r\n      trace the successive steps of the secret conspiracy and open\r\n      sedition, which were at length fatal to Gordian. A sepulchral\r\n      monument was erected to his memory on the spot 50 where he was\r\n      killed, near the conflux of the Euphrates with the little river\r\n      Aboras. 51 The fortunate Philip, raised to the empire by the\r\n      votes of the soldiers, found a ready obedience from the senate\r\n      and the provinces. 52\r\n\r\n      49 (return) [ Hist.

What\r\n      in that age was called the Roman empire, was only an irregular\r\n      republic, not unlike the aristocracy 53 of Algiers, 54 where the\r\n      militia, possessed of the sovereignty, creates and deposes a\r\n      magistrate, who is styled a Dey. Perhaps, indeed, it may be laid\r\n      down as a general rule, that a military government is, in some\r\n      respects, more republican than monarchical. Nor can it be said\r\n      that the soldiers only partook of the government by their\r\n      disobedience and rebellions. The speeches made to them by the\r\n      emperors, were they not at length of the same nature as those\r\n      formerly pronounced to the people by the consuls and the\r\n      tribunes? And although the armies had no regular place or forms\r\n      of assembly; though their debates were short, their action\r\n      sudden, and their resolves seldom the result of cool reflection,\r\n      did they not dispose, with absolute sway, of the public fortune?\r\n      What was the emperor, except the minister of a violent\r\n      government, elected for the private benefit of the soldiers?\r\n\r\n      53 (return) [ Can the epithet of Aristocracy be applied, with any\r\n      propriety, to the government of Algiers?

He requested that the power\r\n      might be equally divided between them; the army would not listen\r\n      to his speech. He consented to be degraded to the rank of Cæsar;\r\n      the favor was refused him. He desired, at least, he might be\r\n      appointed Prætorian præfect; his prayer was rejected. Finally, he\r\n      pleaded for his life. The army, in these several judgments,\r\n      exercised the supreme magistracy.” According to the historian,\r\n      whose doubtful narrative the President De Montesquieu has\r\n      adopted, Philip, who, during the whole transaction, had preserved\r\n      a sullen silence, was inclined to spare the innocent life of his\r\n      benefactor; till, recollecting that his innocence might excite a\r\n      dangerous compassion in the Roman world, he commanded, without\r\n      regard to his suppliant cries, that he should be seized,\r\n      stripped, and led away to instant death.

How could he order his public execution, and yet, in his\r\n      letters to the senate, exculpate himself from the guilt of his\r\n      death?

Since their institution or\r\n      revival by Augustus, 56 they had been celebrated by Claudius, by\r\n      Domitian, and by Severus, and were now renewed the fifth time, on\r\n      the accomplishment of the full period of a thousand years from\r\n      the foundation of Rome. Every circumstance of the secular games\r\n      was skillfully adapted to inspire the superstitious mind with\r\n      deep and solemn reverence. The long interval between them 57\r\n      exceeded the term of human life; and as none of the spectators\r\n      had already seen them, none could flatter themselves with the\r\n      expectation of beholding them a second time. The mystic\r\n      sacrifices were performed, during three nights, on the banks of\r\n      the Tyber; and the Campus Martius resounded with music and\r\n      dances, and was illuminated with innumerable lamps and torches.\r\n      Slaves and strangers were excluded from any participation in\r\n      these national ceremonies. A chorus of twenty-seven youths, and\r\n      as many virgins, of noble families, and whose parents were both\r\n      alive, implored the propitious gods in favor of the present, and\r\n      for the hope of the rising generation; requesting, in religious\r\n      hymns, that according to the faith of their ancient oracles, they\r\n      would still maintain the virtue, the felicity, and the empire of\r\n      the Roman people. The magnificence of Philip’s shows and\r\n      entertainments dazzled the eyes of the multitude. The devout were\r\n      employed in the rites of superstition, whilst the reflecting few\r\n      revolved in their anxious minds the past history and the future\r\n      fate of the empire.58\r\n\r\n      56 (return) [ The account of the last supposed celebration,\r\n      though in an enlightened period of history, was so very doubtful\r\n      and obscure, that the alternative seems not doubtful.

The last three\r\n      hundred years had been consumed in apparent prosperity and\r\n      internal decline. The nation of soldiers, magistrates, and\r\n      legislators, who composed the thirty-five tribes of the Roman\r\n      people, were dissolved into the common mass of mankind, and\r\n      confounded with the millions of servile provincials, who had\r\n      received the name, without adopting the spirit, of Romans. A\r\n      mercenary army, levied among the subjects and barbarians of the\r\n      frontier, was the only order of men who preserved and abused\r\n      their independence. By their tumultuary election, a Syrian, a\r\n      Goth, or an Arab, was exalted to the throne of Rome, and invested\r\n      with despotic power over the conquests and over the country of\r\n      the Scipios.\r\n\r\n      59 (return) [The received calculation of Varro assigns to the\r\n      foundation of Rome an æra that corresponds with the 754th year\r\n      before Christ.

To the undiscerning eye of the vulgar, Philip appeared a\r\n      monarch no less powerful than Hadrian or Augustus had formerly\r\n      been. The form was still the same, but the animating health and\r\n      vigor were fled. The industry of the people was discouraged and\r\n      exhausted by a long series of oppression. The discipline of the\r\n      legions, which alone, after the extinction of every other virtue,\r\n      had propped the greatness of the state, was corrupted by the\r\n      ambition, or relaxed by the weakness, of the emperors. The\r\n      strength of the frontiers, which had always consisted in arms\r\n      rather than in fortifications, was insensibly undermined; and the\r\n      fairest provinces were left exposed to the rapaciousness or\r\n      ambition of the barbarians, who soon discovered the decline of\r\n      the Roman empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter VIII: State Of Persia And Restoration Of The\r\n      Monarchy.—Part I.\r\n\r\n     Of The State Of Persia After The Restoration Of The Monarchy By\r\n     Artaxerxes.\r\n\r\n      Whenever Tacitus indulges himself in those beautiful episodes, in\r\n      which he relates some domestic transaction of the Germans or of\r\n      the Parthians, his principal object is to relieve the attention\r\n      of the reader from a uniform scene of vice and misery. From the\r\n      reign of Augustus to the time of Alexander Severus, the enemies\r\n      of Rome were in her bosom—the tyrants and the soldiers; and her\r\n      prosperity had a very distant and feeble interest in the\r\n      revolutions that might happen beyond the Rhine and the Euphrates.\r\n      But when the military order had levelled, in wild anarchy, the\r\n      power of the prince, the laws of the senate, and even the\r\n      discipline of the camp, the barbarians of the North and of the\r\n      East, who had long hovered on the frontier, boldly attacked the\r\n      provinces of a declining monarchy. Their vexatious inroads were\r\n      changed into formidable irruptions, and, after a long vicissitude\r\n      of mutual calamities, many tribes of the victorious invaders\r\n      established themselves in the provinces of the Roman Empire. To\r\n      obtain a clearer knowledge of these great events, we shall\r\n      endeavor to form a previous idea of the character, forces, and\r\n      designs of those nations who avenged the cause of Hannibal and\r\n      Mithridates.\r\n\r\n      In the more early ages of the world, whilst the forest that\r\n      covered Europe afforded a retreat to a few wandering savages, the\r\n      inhabitants of Asia were already collected into populous cities,\r\n      and reduced under extensive empires the seat of the arts, of\r\n      luxury, and of despotism. The Assyrians reigned over the East, 1\r\n      till the sceptre of Ninus and Semiramis dropped from the hands of\r\n      their enervated successors. The Medes and the Babylonians divided\r\n      their power, and were themselves swallowed up in the monarchy of\r\n      the Persians, whose arms could not be confined within the narrow\r\n      limits of Asia. Followed, as it is said, by two millions of\r\n      _men_, Xerxes, the descendant of Cyrus, invaded Greece.\r\n\r\n      Thirty thousand _soldiers_, under the command of Alexander, the\r\n      son of Philip, who was intrusted by the Greeks with their glory\r\n      and revenge, were sufficient to subdue Persia. The princes of the\r\n      house of Seleucus usurped and lost the Macedonian command over\r\n      the East. About the same time, that, by an ignominious treaty,\r\n      they resigned to the Romans the country on this side Mount Tarus,\r\n      they were driven by the Parthians, 1001 an obscure horde of\r\n      Scythian origin, from all the provinces of Upper Asia. The\r\n      formidable power of the Parthians, which spread from India to the\r\n      frontiers of Syria, was in its turn subverted by Ardshir, or\r\n      Artaxerxes; the founder of a new dynasty, which, under the name\r\n      of Sassanides, governed Persia till the invasion of the Arabs.\r\n      This great revolution, whose fatal influence was soon experienced\r\n      by the Romans, happened in the fourth year of Alexander Severus,\r\n      two hundred and twenty-six years after the Christian era. 2 201\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ An ancient chronologist, quoted by Valleius\r\n      Paterculus, (l. i. c. 6,) observes, that the Assyrians, the\r\n      Medes, the Persians, and the Macedonians, reigned over Asia one\r\n      thousand nine hundred and ninety-five years, from the accession\r\n      of Ninus to the defeat of Antiochus by the Romans.

His birth was obscure, and\r\n      the obscurity equally gave room to the aspersions of his enemies,\r\n      and the flattery of his adherents. If we credit the scandal of\r\n      the former, Artaxerxes sprang from the illegitimate commerce of a\r\n      tanner’s wife with a common soldier. 3 The latter represent him\r\n      as descended from a branch of the ancient kings of Persian,\r\n      though time and misfortune had gradually reduced his ancestors to\r\n      the humble station of private citizens. 4 As the lineal heir of\r\n      the monarchy, he asserted his right to the throne, and challenged\r\n      the noble task of delivering the Persians from the oppression\r\n      under which they groaned above five centuries since the death of\r\n      Darius. The Parthians were defeated in three great battles. 401\r\n      In the last of these their king Artaban was slain, and the spirit\r\n      of the nation was forever broken. 5 The authority of Artaxerxes\r\n      was solemnly acknowledged in a great assembly held at Balch in\r\n      Khorasan. 501 Two younger branches of the royal house of Arsaces\r\n      were confounded among the prostrate satraps.

But these\r\n      pompous titles, instead of gratifying the vanity of the Persian,\r\n      served only to admonish him of his duty, and to inflame in his\r\n      soul the ambition of restoring in their full splendor, the\r\n      religion and empire of Cyrus.\r\n\r\n      3 (return) [ The tanner’s name was Babec; the soldier’s, Sassan:\r\n      from the former Artaxerxes obtained the surname of Babegan, from\r\n      the latter all his descendants have been styled Sassanides.]\r\n\r\n      4 (return) [ D’Herbelot, Bibliotheque Orientale, Ardshir.]\r\n\r\n      401 (return) [ In the plain of Hoormuz, the son of Babek was\r\n      hailed in the field with the proud title of Shahan Shah, king of\r\n      kings—a name ever since assumed by the sovereigns of Persia.\r\n      Malcolm, i. 71.—M.]\r\n\r\n      5 (return) [ Dion Cassius, l. lxxx.

During the long servitude of Persia under the Macedonian and\r\n      the Parthian yoke, the nations of Europe and Asia had mutually\r\n      adopted and corrupted each other’s superstitions. The Arsacides,\r\n      indeed, practised the worship of the Magi; but they disgraced and\r\n      polluted it with a various mixture of foreign idolatry. 601 The\r\n      memory of Zoroaster, the ancient prophet and philosopher of the\r\n      Persians, 7 was still revered in the East; but the obsolete and\r\n      mysterious language, in which the Zendavesta was composed, 8\r\n      opened a field of dispute to seventy sects, who variously\r\n      explained the fundamental doctrines of their religion, and were\r\n      all indifferently devided by a crowd of infidels, who rejected\r\n      the divine mission and miracles of the prophet. To suppress the\r\n      idolaters, reunite the schismatics, and confute the unbelievers,\r\n      by the infallible decision of a general council, the pious\r\n      Artaxerxes summoned the Magi from all parts of his dominions.\r\n      These priests, who had so long sighed in contempt and obscurity\r\n      obeyed the welcome summons; and, on the appointed day, appeared,\r\n      to the number of about eighty thousand. But as the debates of so\r\n      tumultuous an assembly could not have been directed by the\r\n      authority of reason, or influenced by the art of policy, the\r\n      Persian synod was reduced, by successive operations, to forty\r\n      thousand, to four thousand, to four hundred, to forty, and at\r\n      last to seven Magi, the most respected for their learning and\r\n      piety. One of these, Erdaviraph, a young but holy prelate,\r\n      received from the hands of his brethren three cups of\r\n      soporiferous wine. He drank them off, and instantly fell into a\r\n      long and profound sleep. As soon as he waked, he related to the\r\n      king and to the believing multitude, his journey to heaven, and\r\n      his intimate conferences with the Deity. Every doubt was silenced\r\n      by this supernatural evidence; and the articles of the faith of\r\n      Zoroaster were fixed with equal authority and precision. 9 A\r\n      short delineation of that celebrated system will be found useful,\r\n      not only to display the character of the Persian nation, but to\r\n      illustrate many of their most important transactions, both in\r\n      peace and war, with the Roman empire. 10\r\n\r\n      601 (return) [ Silvestre de Sacy (Antiquites de la Perse) had\r\n      proved the neglect of the Zoroastrian religion under the Parthian\r\n      kings.—M.]\r\n\r\n      7 (return) [ Hyde and Prideaux, working up the Persian legends\r\n      and their own conjectures into a very agreeable story, represent\r\n      Zoroaster as a contemporary of Darius Hystaspes.

The\r\n      word means, either the collection of the canonical books of the\r\n      followers of Zoroaster, or the language itself in which they are\r\n      written. They are the books that contain the word of life whether\r\n      the language was originally called Zend, or whether it was so\r\n      called from the contents of the books. Avesta means word, oracle,\r\n      revelation: this term is not the title of a particular work, but\r\n      of the collection of the books of Zoroaster, as the revelation of\r\n      Ormuzd. This collection is sometimes called Zendavesta, sometimes\r\n      briefly Zend. The Zend was the ancient language of Media, as is\r\n      proved by its affinity with the dialects of Armenia and Georgia;\r\n      it was already a dead language under the Arsacides in the country\r\n      which was the scene of the events recorded in the Zendavesta.\r\n      Some critics, among others Richardson and Sir W. Jones, have\r\n      called in question the antiquity of these books. The former\r\n      pretended that Zend had never been a written or spoken language,\r\n      but had been invented in the later times by the Magi, for the\r\n      purposes of their art; but Kleuker, in the dissertations which he\r\n      added to those of Anquetil and the Abbé Foucher, has proved that\r\n      the Zend was a living and spoken language.—G. Sir W. Jones\r\n      appears to have abandoned his doubts, on discovering the affinity\r\n      between the Zend and the Sanskrit. Since the time of Kleuker,\r\n      this question has been investigated by many learned scholars. Sir\r\n      W. Jones, Leyden, (Asiat. Research. x. 283,) and Mr. Erskine,\r\n      (Bombay Trans. ii. 299,) consider it a derivative from the\r\n      Sanskrit. The antiquity of the Zendavesta has likewise been\r\n      asserted by Rask, the great Danish linguist, who, according to\r\n      Malcolm, brought back from the East fresh transcripts and\r\n      additions to those published by Anquetil. According to Rask, the\r\n      Zend and Sanskrit are sister dialects; the one the parent of the\r\n      Persian, the other of the Indian family of languages.—G. and\r\n      M.——But the subject is more satisfactorily illustrated in Bopp’s\r\n      comparative Grammar of the Sanscrit, Zend, Greek, Latin,\r\n      Lithuanian, Gothic, and German languages.

Ol. shausen, in Hamburg.—M.——The Pehlvi was the language\r\n      of the countries bordering on Assyria, and probably of Assyria\r\n      itself. Pehlvi signifies valor, heroism; the Pehlvi, therefore,\r\n      was the language of the ancient heroes and kings of Persia, the\r\n      valiant. (Mr. Erskine prefers the derivation from Pehla, a\r\n      border.—M.) It contains a number of Aramaic roots. Anquetil\r\n      considered it formed from the Zend. Kleuker does not adopt this\r\n      opinion. The Pehlvi, he says, is much more flowing, and less\r\n      overcharged with vowels, than the Zend. The books of Zoroaster,\r\n      first written in Zend, were afterwards translated into Pehlvi and\r\n      Parsi. The Pehlvi had fallen into disuse under the dynasty of the\r\n      Sassanides, but the learned still wrote it.

The first and original Being, in whom, or\r\n      by whom, the universe exists, is denominated in the writings of\r\n      Zoroaster, _Time without bounds_; 1001a but it must be confessed,\r\n      that this infinite substance seems rather a metaphysical\r\n      abstraction of the mind than a real object endowed with\r\n      self-consciousness, or possessed of moral perfections. From\r\n      either the blind or the intelligent operation of this infinite\r\n      Time, which bears but too near an affinity with the chaos of the\r\n      Greeks, the two secondary but active principles of the universe\r\n      were from all eternity produced, Ormusd and Ahriman, each of them\r\n      possessed of the powers of creation, but each disposed, by his\r\n      invariable nature, to exercise them with different designs. 1002\r\n      The principle of good is eternally aborbed in light; the\r\n      principle of evil eternally buried in darkness. The wise\r\n      benevolence of Ormusd formed man capable of virtue, and\r\n      abundantly provided his fair habitation with the materials of\r\n      happiness. By his vigilant providence, the motion of the planets,\r\n      the order of the seasons, and the temperate mixture of the\r\n      elements, are preserved. But the malice of Ahriman has long since\r\n      pierced _Ormusd’s egg;_ or, in other words, has violated the\r\n      harmony of his works. Since that fatal eruption, the most minute\r\n      articles of good and evil are intimately intermingled and\r\n      agitated together; the rankest poisons spring up amidst the most\r\n      salutary plants; deluges, earthquakes, and conflagrations attest\r\n      the conflict of Nature, and the little world of man is\r\n      perpetually shaken by vice and misfortune. Whilst the rest of\r\n      human kind are led away captives in the chains of their infernal\r\n      enemy, the faithful Persian alone reserves his religious\r\n      adoration for his friend and protector Ormusd, and fights under\r\n      his banner of light, in the full confidence that he shall, in the\r\n      last day, share the glory of his triumph. At that decisive\r\n      period, the enlightened wisdom of goodness will render the power\r\n      of Ormusd superior to the furious malice of his rival. Ahriman\r\n      and his followers, disarmed and subdued, will sink into their\r\n      native darkness; and virtue will maintain the eternal peace and\r\n      harmony of the universe. 11 1101\r\n\r\n      1001a (return) [ Zeruane Akerene, so translated by Anquetil and\r\n      Kleuker.

But the Persians of every age have denied the\r\n      charge, and explained the equivocal conduct, which might appear\r\n      to give a color to it. The elements, and more particularly Fire,\r\n      Light, and the Sun, whom they called Mithra, 1201 were the\r\n      objects of their religious reverence because they considered them\r\n      as the purest symbols, the noblest productions, and the most\r\n      powerful agents of the Divine Power and Nature. 13\r\n\r\n      12 (return) [ Herodotus, l. i. c. 131.

Mithra is the first of the genii, or jzeds,\r\n      created by Ormuzd; it is he who watches over all nature. Hence\r\n      arose the misapprehension of some of the Greeks, who have said\r\n      that Mithra was the summus deus of the Persians: he has a\r\n      thousand ears and ten thousand eyes. The Chaldeans appear to have\r\n      assigned him a higher rank than the Persians. It is he who\r\n      bestows upon the earth the light of the sun. The sun. named Khor,\r\n      (brightness,) is thus an inferior genius, who, with many other\r\n      genii, bears a part in the functions of Mithra. These assistant\r\n      genii to another genius are called his kamkars; but in the\r\n      Zendavesta they are never confounded. On the days sacred to a\r\n      particular genius, the Persian ought to recite, not only the\r\n      prayers addressed to him, but those also which are addressed to\r\n      his kamkars; thus the hymn or iescht of Mithra is recited on the\r\n      day of the sun, (Khor,) and vice versa. It is probably this which\r\n      has sometimes caused them to be confounded; but Anquetil had\r\n      himself exposed this error, which Kleuker, and all who have\r\n      studied the Zendavesta, have noticed. See viii. Diss. of\r\n      Anquetil. Kleuker’s Anhang, part iii. p. 132.—G. M. Guizot is\r\n      unquestionably right, according to the pure and original doctrine\r\n      of the Zend. The Mithriac worship, which was so extensively\r\n      propagated in the West, and in which Mithra and the sun were\r\n      perpetually confounded, seems to have been formed from a fusion\r\n      of Zoroastrianism and Chaldaism, or the Syrian worship of the\r\n      sun. An excellent abstract of the question, with references to\r\n      the works of the chief modern writers on his curious subject, De\r\n      Sacy, Kleuker, Von Hammer, &c., may be found in De Guigniaut’s\r\n      translation of Kreuzer.

Notwithstanding all\r\n      their distinctions and protestations, which seem sincere enough,\r\n      their tyrants, the Mahometans, have constantly stigmatized them\r\n      as idolatrous worshippers of the fire.]\r\n\r\n      Every mode of religion, to make a deep and lasting impression on\r\n      the human mind, must exercise our obedience, by enjoining\r\n      practices of devotion, for which we can assign no reason; and\r\n      must acquire our esteem, by inculcating moral duties analogous to\r\n      the dictates of our own hearts. The religion of Zoroaster was\r\n      abundantly provided with the former and possessed a sufficient\r\n      portion of the latter. At the age of puberty, the faithful\r\n      Persian was invested with a mysterious girdle, the badge of the\r\n      divine protection; and from that moment all the actions of his\r\n      life, even the most indifferent, or the most necessary, were\r\n      sanctified by their peculiar prayers, ejaculations, or\r\n      genuflections; the omission of which, under any circumstances,\r\n      was a grievous sin, not inferior in guilt to the violation of the\r\n      moral duties. The moral duties, however, of justice, mercy,\r\n      liberality, &c., were in their turn required of the disciple of\r\n      Zoroaster, who wished to escape the persecution of Ahriman, and\r\n      to live with Ormusd in a blissful eternity, where the degree of\r\n      felicity will be exactly proportioned to the degree of virtue and\r\n      piety. 14\r\n\r\n      14 (return) [ See the Sadder, the smallest part of which consists\r\n      of moral precepts. The ceremonies enjoined are infinite and\r\n      trifling.

This is the\r\n      progress of all religions the worship, simple in its origin, is\r\n      gradually overloaded with minute superstitions. The maxim of the\r\n      Zendavesta, on the relative merit of sowing the earth and of\r\n      prayers, quoted below by Gibbon, proves that Zoroaster did not\r\n      attach too much importance to these observances. Thus it is not\r\n      from the Zendavesta that Gibbon derives the proof of his\r\n      allegation, but from the Sadder, a much later work.—G]\r\n\r\n      But there are some remarkable instances in which Zoroaster lays\r\n      aside the prophet, assumes the legislator, and discovers a\r\n      liberal concern for private and public happiness, seldom to be\r\n      found among the grovelling or visionary schemes of superstition.\r\n      Fasting and celibacy, the common means of purchasing the divine\r\n      favor, he condemns with abhorrence as a criminal rejection of the\r\n      best gifts of Providence. The saint, in the Magian religion, is\r\n      obliged to beget children, to plant useful trees, to destroy\r\n      noxious animals, to convey water to the dry lands of Persia, and\r\n      to work out his salvation by pursuing all the labors of\r\n      agriculture. 1401 We may quote from the Zendavesta a wise and\r\n      benevolent maxim, which compensates for many an absurdity. “He\r\n      who sows the ground with care and diligence acquires a greater\r\n      stock of religious merit than he could gain by the repetition of\r\n      ten thousand prayers.” 15 In the spring of every year a festival\r\n      was celebrated, destined to represent the primitive equality, and\r\n      the present connection, of mankind. The stately kings of Persia,\r\n      exchanging their vain pomp for more genuine greatness, freely\r\n      mingled with the humblest but most useful of their subjects. On\r\n      that day the husbandmen were admitted, without distinction, to\r\n      the table of the king and his satraps. The monarch accepted their\r\n      petitions, inquired into their grievances, and conversed with\r\n      them on the most equal terms. “From your labors,” was he\r\n      accustomed to say, (and to say with truth, if not with\r\n      sincerity,) “from your labors we receive our subsistence; you\r\n      derive your tranquillity from our vigilance: since, therefore, we\r\n      are mutually necessary to each other, let us live together like\r\n      brothers in concord and love.” 16 Such a festival must indeed\r\n      have degenerated, in a wealthy and despotic empire, into a\r\n      theatrical representation; but it was at least a comedy well\r\n      worthy of a royal audience, and which might sometimes imprint a\r\n      salutary lesson on the mind of a young prince.\r\n\r\n      1401 (return) [ See, on Zoroaster’s encouragement of agriculture,\r\n      the ingenious remarks of Heeren, Ideen, vol. i. p. 449, &c., and\r\n      Rhode, Heilige Sage, p. 517—M.]\r\n\r\n      15 (return) [ Zendavesta, tom. i. p. 224, and Precis du Systeme\r\n      de Zoroastre, tom. iii.]\r\n\r\n      16 (return) [ Hyde de Religione Persarum, c. 19.]\r\n\r\n      Had Zoroaster, in all his institutions, invariably supported this\r\n      exalted character, his name would deserve a place with those of\r\n      Numa and Confucius, and his system would be justly entitled to\r\n      all the applause, which it has pleased some of our divines, and\r\n      even some of our philosophers, to bestow on it. But in that\r\n      motley composition, dictated by reason and passion, by enthusiasm\r\n      and by selfish motives, some useful and sublime truths were\r\n      disgraced by a mixture of the most abject and dangerous\r\n      superstition. The Magi, or sacerdotal order, were extremely\r\n      numerous, since, as we have already seen, fourscore thousand of\r\n      them were convened in a general council. Their forces were\r\n      multiplied by discipline. A regular hierarchy was diffused\r\n      through all the provinces of Persia; and the Archimagus, who\r\n      resided at Balch, was respected as the visible head of the\r\n      church, and the lawful successor of Zoroaster. 17 The property of\r\n      the Magi was very considerable. Besides the less invidious\r\n      possession of a large tract of the most fertile lands of Media,\r\n      18 they levied a general tax on the fortunes and the industry of\r\n      the Persians. 19 “Though your good works,” says the interested\r\n      prophet, “exceed in number the leaves of the trees, the drops of\r\n      rain, the stars in the heaven, or the sands on the sea-shore,\r\n      they will all be unprofitable to you, unless they are accepted by\r\n      the _destour_, or priest.

The temples of the\r\n      Parthians, and the statues of their deified monarchs, were thrown\r\n      down with ignominy. 27 The sword of Aristotle (such was the name\r\n      given by the Orientals to the polytheism and philosophy of the\r\n      Greeks) was easily broken; 28 the flames of persecution soon\r\n      reached the more stubborn Jews and Christians; 29 nor did they\r\n      spare the heretics of their own nation and religion. The majesty\r\n      of Ormusd, who was jealous of a rival, was seconded by the\r\n      despotism of Artaxerxes, who could not suffer a rebel; and the\r\n      schismatics within his vast empire were soon reduced to the\r\n      inconsiderable number of eighty thousand. 30 301 This spirit of\r\n      persecution reflects dishonor on the religion of Zoroaster; but\r\n      as it was not productive of any civil commotion, it served to\r\n      strengthen the new monarchy, by uniting all the various\r\n      inhabitants of Persia in the bands of religious zeal. 302\r\n\r\n      24 (return) [ Mr. Hume, in the Natural History of Religion,\r\n      sagaciously remarks, that the most refined and philosophic sects\r\n      are constantly the most intolerant. * Note: Hume’s comparison is\r\n      rather between theism and polytheism.

There still\r\n      remained the more difficult task of establishing, throughout the\r\n      vast extent of Persia, a uniform and vigorous administration. The\r\n      weak indulgence of the Arsacides had resigned to their sons and\r\n      brothers the principal provinces, and the greatest offices of the\r\n      kingdom in the nature of hereditary possessions. The _vitaxæ_, or\r\n      eighteen most powerful satraps, were permitted to assume the\r\n      regal title; and the vain pride of the monarch was delighted with\r\n      a nominal dominion over so many vassal kings. Even tribes of\r\n      barbarians in their mountains, and the Greek cities of Upper\r\n      Asia, 31 within their walls, scarcely acknowledged, or seldom\r\n      obeyed. any superior; and the Parthian empire exhibited, under\r\n      other names, a lively image of the feudal system 32 which has\r\n      since prevailed in Europe. But the active victor, at the head of\r\n      a numerous and disciplined army, visited in person every province\r\n      of Persia. The defeat of the boldest rebels, and the reduction of\r\n      the strongest fortifications, 33 diffused the terror of his arms,\r\n      and prepared the way for the peaceful reception of his authority.\r\n      An obstinate resistance was fatal to the chiefs; but their\r\n      followers were treated with lenity. 34 A cheerful submission was\r\n      rewarded with honors and riches, but the prudent Artaxerxes,\r\n      suffering no person except himself to assume the title of king,\r\n      abolished every intermediate power between the throne and the\r\n      people. His kingdom, nearly equal in extent to modern Persia,\r\n      was, on every side, bounded by the sea, or by great rivers; by\r\n      the Euphrates, the Tigris, the Araxes, the Oxus, and the Indus,\r\n      by the Caspian Sea, and the Gulf of Persia. 35 That country was\r\n      computed to contain, in the last century, five hundred and\r\n      fifty-four cities, sixty thousand villages, and about forty\r\n      millions of souls. 36 If we compare the administration of the\r\n      house of Sassan with that of the house of Sefi, the political\r\n      influence of the Magian with that of the Mahometan religion, we\r\n      shall probably infer, that the kingdom of Artaxerxes contained at\r\n      least as great a number of cities, villages, and inhabitants. But\r\n      it must likewise be confessed, that in every age the want of\r\n      harbors on the sea-coast, and the scarcity of fresh water in the\r\n      inland provinces, have been very unfavorable to the commerce and\r\n      agriculture of the Persians; who, in the calculation of their\r\n      numbers, seem to have indulged one of the meanest, though most\r\n      common, artifices of national vanity.\r\n\r\n      31 (return) [ These colonies were extremely numerous.

He obtained some\r\n      easy victories over the wild Scythians and the effeminate\r\n      Indians; but the Romans were an enemy, who, by their past\r\n      injuries and present power, deserved the utmost efforts of his\r\n      arms.

They were received as friends by the\r\n      Greek colony; they attacked as enemies the seat of the Parthian\r\n      kings; yet both cities experienced the same treatment. The sack\r\n      and conflagration of Seleucia, with the massacre of three hundred\r\n      thousand of the inhabitants, tarnished the glory of the Roman\r\n      triumph. 42 Seleucia, already exhausted by the neighborhood of a\r\n      too powerful rival, sunk under the fatal blow; but Ctesiphon, in\r\n      about thirty-three years, had sufficiently recovered its strength\r\n      to maintain an obstinate siege against the emperor Severus. The\r\n      city was, however, taken by assault; the king, who defended it in\r\n      person, escaped with precipitation; a hundred thousand captives,\r\n      and a rich booty, rewarded the fatigues of the Roman soldiers. 43\r\n      Notwithstanding these misfortunes, Ctesiphon succeeded to Babylon\r\n      and to Seleucia, as one of the great capitals of the East. In\r\n      summer, the monarch of Persia enjoyed at Ecbatana the cool\r\n      breezes of the mountains of Media; but the mildness of the\r\n      climate engaged him to prefer Ctesiphon for his winter residence.\r\n\r\n      38 (return) [ For the precise situation of Babylon, Seleucia,\r\n      Ctesiphon, Moiain, and Bagdad, cities often confounded with each\r\n      other, see an excellent Geographical Tract of M. d’Anville, in\r\n      Mem. de l’Academie, tom. xxx.]\r\n\r\n      39 (return) [ Tacit.

The reduction of the kingdom of\r\n      Osrhoene was an acquisition of less splendor indeed, but of a far\r\n      more solid advantage. That little state occupied the northern and\r\n      most fertile part of Mesopotamia, between the Euphrates and the\r\n      Tigris. Edessa, its capital, was situated about twenty miles\r\n      beyond the former of those rivers; and the inhabitants, since the\r\n      time of Alexander, were a mixed race of Greeks, Arabs, Syrians,\r\n      and Armenians. 44 The feeble sovereigns of Osrhoene, placed on\r\n      the dangerous verge of two contending empires, were attached from\r\n      inclination to the Parthian cause; but the superior power of Rome\r\n      exacted from them a reluctant homage, which is still attested by\r\n      their medals. After the conclusion of the Parthian war under\r\n      Marcus, it was judged prudent to secure some substantial pledges\r\n      of their doubtful fidelity. Forts were constructed in several\r\n      parts of the country, and a Roman garrison was fixed in the\r\n      strong town of Nisibis. During the troubles that followed the\r\n      death of Commodus, the princes of Osrhoene attempted to shake off\r\n      the yoke; but the stern policy of Severus confirmed their\r\n      dependence, 45 and the perfidy of Caracalla completed the easy\r\n      conquest. Abgarus, the last king of Edessa, was sent in chains to\r\n      Rome, his dominions reduced into a province, and his capital\r\n      dignified with the rank of colony; and thus the Romans, about ten\r\n      years before the fall of the Parthian monarchy, obtained a firm\r\n      and permanent establishment beyond the Euphrates. 46\r\n\r\n      44 (return) [ The polished citizens of Antioch called those of\r\n      Edessa mixed barbarians.

Cyrus, he alleged, had\r\n      first subdued, and his successors had for a long time possessed,\r\n      the whole extent of Asia, as far as the Propontis and the Ægean\r\n      Sea; the provinces of Caria and Ionia, under their empire, had\r\n      been governed by Persian satraps, and all Egypt, to the confines\r\n      of Æthiopia, had acknowledged their sovereignty. 47 Their rights\r\n      had been suspended, but not destroyed, by a long usurpation; and\r\n      as soon as he received the Persian diadem, which birth and\r\n      successful valor had placed upon his head, the first great duty\r\n      of his station called upon him to restore the ancient limits and\r\n      splendor of the monarchy. The Great King, therefore, (such was\r\n      the haughty style of his embassies to the emperor Alexander,)\r\n      commanded the Romans instantly to depart from all the provinces\r\n      of his ancestors, and, yielding to the Persians the empire of\r\n      Asia, to content themselves with the undisturbed possession of\r\n      Europe. This haughty mandate was delivered by four hundred of the\r\n      tallest and most beautiful of the Persians; who, by their fine\r\n      horses, splendid arms, and rich apparel, displayed the pride and\r\n      greatness of their master. 48 Such an embassy was much less an\r\n      offer of negotiation than a declaration of war. Both Alexander\r\n      Severus and Artaxerxes, collecting the military force of the\r\n      Roman and Persian monarchies, resolved in this important contest\r\n      to lead their armies in person.\r\n\r\n      47 (return) [ Xenophon, in the preface to the Cyropædia, gives a\r\n      clear and magnificent idea of the extent of the empire of Cyrus.\r\n      Herodotus (l. iii. c. 79, &c.) enters into a curious and\r\n      particular description of the twenty great Satrapies into which\r\n      the Persian empire was divided by Darius Hystaspes.]\r\n\r\n      48 (return) [ Herodian, vi. 209, 212.]\r\n\r\n      If we credit what should seem the most authentic of all records,\r\n      an oration, still extant, and delivered by the emperor himself to\r\n      the senate, we must allow that the victory of Alexander Severus\r\n      was not inferior to any of those formerly obtained over the\r\n      Persians by the son of Philip. The army of the Great King\r\n      consisted of one hundred and twenty thousand horse, clothed in\r\n      complete armor of steel; of seven hundred elephants, with towers\r\n      filled with archers on their backs, and of eighteen hundred\r\n      chariots armed with scythes.

The Great King fled before his\r\n      valor; an immense booty, and the conquest of Mesopotamia, were\r\n      the immediate fruits of this signal victory.

Instead of\r\n      three or four thousand elephants, which the Great Mogul was\r\n      supposed to possess, Tavernier (Voyages, part ii. l. i. p. 198)\r\n      discovered, by a more accurate inquiry, that he had only five\r\n      hundred for his baggage, and eighty or ninety for the service of\r\n      war. The Greeks have varied with regard to the number which Porus\r\n      brought into the field; but Quintus Curtius, (viii. 13,) in this\r\n      instance judicious and moderate, is contented with eighty-five\r\n      elephants, distinguished by their size and strength. In Siam,\r\n      where these animals are the most numerous and the most esteemed,\r\n      eighteen elephants are allowed as a sufficient proportion for\r\n      each of the nine brigades into which a just army is divided. The\r\n      whole number, of one hundred and sixty-two elephants of war, may\r\n      sometimes be doubled.

According to the Persian authorities Ardeschir extended\r\n      his conquests to the Euphrates. Malcolm i. 71.—M.]\r\n\r\n      Our suspicions are confirmed by the authority of a contemporary\r\n      historian, who mentions the virtues of Alexander with respect,\r\n      and his faults with candor. He describes the judicious plan which\r\n      had been formed for the conduct of the war. Three Roman armies\r\n      were destined to invade Persia at the same time, and by different\r\n      roads. But the operations of the campaign, though wisely\r\n      concerted, were not executed either with ability or success. The\r\n      first of these armies, as soon as it had entered the marshy\r\n      plains of Babylon, towards the artificial conflux of the\r\n      Euphrates and the Tigris, 51 was encompassed by the superior\r\n      numbers, and destroyed by the arrows of the enemy. The alliance\r\n      of Chosroes, king of Armenia, 52 and the long tract of\r\n      mountainous country, in which the Persian cavalry was of little\r\n      service, opened a secure entrance into the heart of Media, to the\r\n      second of the Roman armies. These brave troops laid waste the\r\n      adjacent provinces, and by several successful actions against\r\n      Artaxerxes, gave a faint color to the emperor’s vanity. But the\r\n      retreat of this victorious army was imprudent, or at least\r\n      unfortunate. In repassing the mountains, great numbers of\r\n      soldiers perished by the badness of the roads, and the severity\r\n      of the winter season. It had been resolved, that whilst these two\r\n      great detachments penetrated into the opposite extremes of the\r\n      Persian dominions, the main body, under the command of Alexander\r\n      himself, should support their attack, by invading the centre of\r\n      the kingdom. But the unexperienced youth, influenced by his\r\n      mother’s counsels, and perhaps by his own fears, deserted the\r\n      bravest troops, and the fairest prospect of victory; and after\r\n      consuming in Mesopotamia an inactive and inglorious summer, he\r\n      led back to Antioch an army diminished by sickness, and provoked\r\n      by disappointment. The behavior of Artaxerxes had been very\r\n      different. Flying with rapidity from the hills of Media to the\r\n      marshes of the Euphrates, he had everywhere opposed the invaders\r\n      in person; and in either fortune had united with the ablest\r\n      conduct the most undaunted resolution. But in several obstinate\r\n      engagements against the veteran legions of Rome, the Persian\r\n      monarch had lost the flower of his troops. Even his victories had\r\n      weakened his power. The favorable opportunities of the absence of\r\n      Alexander, and of the confusions that followed that emperor’s\r\n      death, presented themselves in vain to his ambition. Instead of\r\n      expelling the Romans, as he pretended, from the continent of\r\n      Asia, he found himself unable to wrest from their hands the\r\n      little province of Mesopotamia. 53\r\n\r\n      51 (return) [ M. de Tillemont has already observed, that\r\n      Herodian’s geography is somewhat confused.]\r\n\r\n      52 (return) [ Moses of Chorene (Hist.

His character\r\n      seems to have been marked by those bold and commanding features,\r\n      that generally distinguish the princes who conquer, from those\r\n      who inherit, an empire. Till the last period of the Persian\r\n      monarchy, his code of laws was respected as the groundwork of\r\n      their civil and religious policy. 54 Several of his sayings are\r\n      preserved. One of them in particular discovers a deep insight\r\n      into the constitution of government. “The authority of the\r\n      prince,” said Artaxerxes, “must be defended by a military force;\r\n      that force can only be maintained by taxes; all taxes must, at\r\n      last, fall upon agriculture; and agriculture can never flourish\r\n      except under the protection of justice and moderation.” 55\r\n      Artaxerxes bequeathed his new empire, and his ambitious designs\r\n      against the Romans, to Sapor, a son not unworthy of his great\r\n      father; but those designs were too extensive for the power of\r\n      Persia, and served only to involve both nations in a long series\r\n      of destructive wars and reciprocal calamities.\r\n\r\n      54 (return) [Eutychius, tom. ii. p. 180, vers.

Compare\r\n      Malcolm, i. 79.—M.]\r\n\r\n      The Persians, long since civilized and corrupted, were very far\r\n      from possessing the martial independence, and the intrepid\r\n      hardiness, both of mind and body, which have rendered the\r\n      northern barbarians masters of the world. The science of war,\r\n      that constituted the more rational force of Greece and Rome, as\r\n      it now does of Europe, never made any considerable progress in\r\n      the East. Those disciplined evolutions which harmonize and\r\n      animate a confused multitude, were unknown to the Persians. They\r\n      were equally unskilled in the arts of constructing, besieging, or\r\n      defending regular fortifications. They trusted more to their\r\n      numbers than to their courage; more to their courage than to\r\n      their discipline. The infantry was a half-armed, spiritless crowd\r\n      of peasants, levied in haste by the allurements of plunder, and\r\n      as easily dispersed by a victory as by a defeat. The monarch and\r\n      his nobles transported into the camp the pride and luxury of the\r\n      seraglio. Their military operations were impeded by a useless\r\n      train of women, eunuchs, horses, and camels; and in the midst of\r\n      a successful campaign, the Persian host was often separated or\r\n      destroyed by an unexpected famine. 56\r\n\r\n      56 (return) [ Herodian, l. vi. p. 214.

From the age of seven years they were taught to speak\r\n      truth, to shoot with the bow, and to ride; and it was universally\r\n      confessed that in the two last of these arts they had made a more\r\n      than common proficiency. 57 The most distinguished youth were\r\n      educated under the monarch’s eye, practised their exercises in\r\n      the gate of his palace, and were severely trained up to the\r\n      habits of temperance and obedience, in their long and laborious\r\n      parties of hunting. In every province, the satrap maintained a\r\n      like school of military virtue. The Persian nobles (so natural is\r\n      the idea of feudal tenures) received from the king’s bounty lands\r\n      and houses, on the condition of their service in war. They were\r\n      ready on the first summons to mount on horseback, with a martial\r\n      and splendid train of followers, and to join the numerous bodies\r\n      of guards, who were carefully selected from among the most robust\r\n      slaves, and the bravest adventurers of Asia. These armies, both\r\n      of light and of heavy cavalry, equally formidable by the\r\n      impetuosity of their charge and the rapidity of their motions,\r\n      threatened, as an impending cloud, the eastern provinces of the\r\n      declining empire of Rome. 58\r\n\r\n      57 (return) [ The Persians are still the most skilful horsemen,\r\n      and their horses the finest in the East.]\r\n\r\n      58 (return) [ From Herodotus, Xenophon, Herodian, Ammianus,\r\n      Chardin, &c., I have extracted such probable accounts of the\r\n      Persian nobility, as seem either common to every age, or\r\n      particular to that of the Sassanides.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter IX: State Of Germany Until The Barbarians.—Part I.\r\n\r\n     The State Of Germany Till The Invasion Of The Barbarians In The\r\n     Time Of The Emperor Decius.\r\n\r\n      The government and religion of Persia have deserved some notice,\r\n      from their connection with the decline and fall of the Roman\r\n      empire. We shall occasionally mention the Scythian or Sarmatian\r\n      tribes, 1001 which, with their arms and horses, their flocks and\r\n      herds, their wives and families, wandered over the immense plains\r\n      which spread themselves from the Caspian Sea to the Vistula, from\r\n      the confines of Persia to those of Germany. But the warlike\r\n      Germans, who first resisted, then invaded, and at length\r\n      overturned the Western monarchy of Rome, will occupy a much more\r\n      important place in this history, and possess a stronger, and, if\r\n      we may use the expression, a more domestic, claim to our\r\n      attention and regard. The most civilized nations of modern Europe\r\n      issued from the woods of Germany; and in the rude institutions of\r\n      those barbarians we may still distinguish the original principles\r\n      of our present laws and manners. In their primitive state of\r\n      simplicity and independence, the Germans were surveyed by the\r\n      discerning eye, and delineated by the masterly pencil, of\r\n      Tacitus, 1002 the first of historians who applied the science of\r\n      philosophy to the study of facts. The expressive conciseness of\r\n      his descriptions has served to exercise the diligence of\r\n      innumerable antiquarians, and to excite the genius and\r\n      penetration of the philosophic historians of our own times. The\r\n      subject, however various and important, has already been so\r\n      frequently, so ably, and so successfully discussed, that it is\r\n      now grown familiar to the reader, and difficult to the writer. We\r\n      shall therefore content ourselves with observing, and indeed with\r\n      repeating, some of the most important circumstances of climate,\r\n      of manners, and of institutions, which rendered the wild\r\n      barbarians of Germany such formidable enemies to the Roman power.\r\n\r\n      1001 (return) [ The Scythians, even according to the ancients,\r\n      are not Sarmatians. It may be doubted whether Gibbon intended to\r\n      confound them.—M. ——The Greeks, after having divided the world\r\n      into Greeks and barbarians. divided the barbarians into four\r\n      great classes, the Celts, the Scythians, the Indians, and the\r\n      Ethiopians. They called Celts all the inhabitants of Gaul.\r\n      Scythia extended from the Baltic Sea to the Lake Aral: the people\r\n      enclosed in the angle to the north-east, between Celtica and\r\n      Scythia, were called Celto-Scythians, and the Sarmatians were\r\n      placed in the southern part of that angle. But these names of\r\n      Celts, of Scythians, of Celto-Scythians, and Sarmatians, were\r\n      invented, says Schlozer, by the profound cosmographical ignorance\r\n      of the Greeks, and have no real ground; they are purely\r\n      geographical divisions, without any relation to the true\r\n      affiliation of the different races. Thus all the inhabitants of\r\n      Gaul are called Celts by most of the ancient writers; yet Gaul\r\n      contained three totally distinct nations, the Belgæ, the\r\n      Aquitani, and the Gauls, properly so called.

On the west, ancient Germany was divided by\r\n      the Rhine from the Gallic, and on the south, by the Danube, from\r\n      the Illyrian, provinces of the empire. A ridge of hills, rising\r\n      from the Danube, and called the Carpathian Mountains, covered\r\n      Germany on the side of Dacia or Hungary. The eastern frontier was\r\n      faintly marked by the mutual fears of the Germans and the\r\n      Sarmatians, and was often confounded by the mixture of warring\r\n      and confederating tribes of the two nations. In the remote\r\n      darkness of the north, the ancients imperfectly descried a frozen\r\n      ocean that lay beyond the Baltic Sea, and beyond the Peninsula,\r\n      or islands 1001a of Scandinavia.\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ Germany was not of such vast extent. It is from\r\n      Cæsar, and more particularly from Ptolemy, (says Gatterer,) that\r\n      we can know what was the state of ancient Germany before the wars\r\n      with the Romans had changed the positions of the tribes. Germany,\r\n      as changed by these wars, has been described by Strabo, Pliny,\r\n      and Tacitus. Germany, properly so called, was bounded on the west\r\n      by the Rhine, on the east by the Vistula, on the north by the\r\n      southern point of Norway, by Sweden, and Esthonia. On the south,\r\n      the Maine and the mountains to the north of Bohemia formed the\r\n      limits. Before the time of Cæsar, the country between the Maine\r\n      and the Danube was partly occupied by the Helvetians and other\r\n      Gauls, partly by the Hercynian forest but, from the time of Cæsar\r\n      to the great migration, these boundaries were advanced as far as\r\n      the Danube, or, what is the same thing, to the Suabian Alps,\r\n      although the Hercynian forest still occupied, from north to\r\n      south, a space of nine days’ journey on both banks of the Danube.\r\n      “Gatterer, Versuch einer all-gemeinen Welt-Geschichte,” p. 424,\r\n      edit. de 1792. This vast country was far from being inhabited by\r\n      a single nation divided into different tribes of the same origin.\r\n      We may reckon three principal races, very distinct in their\r\n      language, their origin, and their customs. 1. To the east, the\r\n      Slaves or Vandals. 2. To the west, the Cimmerians or Cimbri. 3.\r\n      Between the Slaves and Cimbrians, the Germans, properly so\r\n      called, the Suevi of Tacitus. The South was inhabited, before\r\n      Julius Cæsar, by nations of Gaulish origin, afterwards by the\r\n      Suevi.—G. On the position of these nations, the German\r\n      antiquaries differ. I. The Slaves, or Sclavonians, or Wendish\r\n      tribes, according to Schlozer, were originally settled in parts\r\n      of Germany unknown to the Romans, Mecklenburgh, Pomerania,\r\n      Brandenburgh, Upper Saxony; and Lusatia. According to Gatterer,\r\n      they remained to the east of the Theiss, the Niemen, and the\r\n      Vistula, till the third century. The Slaves, according to\r\n      Procopius and Jornandes, formed three great divisions. 1. The\r\n      Venedi or Vandals, who took the latter name, (the Wenden,) having\r\n      expelled the Vandals, properly so called, (a Suevian race, the\r\n      conquerors of Africa,) from the country between the Memel and the\r\n      Vistula. 2. The Antes, who inhabited between the Dneister and the\r\n      Dnieper. 3. The Sclavonians, properly so called, in the north of\r\n      Dacia. During the great migration, these races advanced into\r\n      Germany as far as the Saal and the Elbe. The Sclavonian language\r\n      is the stem from which have issued the Russian, the Polish, the\r\n      Bohemian, and the dialects of Lusatia, of some parts of the duchy\r\n      of Luneburgh, of Carniola, Carinthia, and Styria, &c.; those of\r\n      Croatia, Bosnia, and Bulgaria. Schlozer, Nordische Geschichte, p.\r\n      323, 335. II. The Cimbric race. Adelung calls by this name all\r\n      who were not Suevi. This race had passed the Rhine, before the\r\n      time of Cæsar, occupied Belgium, and are the Belgæ of Cæsar and\r\n      Pliny. The Cimbrians also occupied the Isle of Jutland. The Cymri\r\n      of Wales and of Britain are of this race. Many tribes on the\r\n      right bank of the Rhine, the Guthini in Jutland, the Usipeti in\r\n      Westphalia, the Sigambri in the duchy of Berg, were German\r\n      Cimbrians. III. The Suevi, known in very early times by the\r\n      Romans, for they are mentioned by L. Corn. Sisenna, who lived 123\r\n      years before Christ, (Nonius v. Lancea.) This race, the real\r\n      Germans, extended to the Vistula, and from the Baltic to the\r\n      Hercynian forest. The name of Suevi was sometimes confined to a\r\n      single tribe, as by Cæsar to the Catti. The name of the Suevi has\r\n      been preserved in Suabia. These three were the principal races\r\n      which inhabited Germany; they moved from east to west, and are\r\n      the parent stem of the modern natives. But northern Europe,\r\n      according to Schlozer, was not peopled by them alone; other\r\n      races, of different origin, and speaking different languages,\r\n      have inhabited and left descendants in these countries. The\r\n      German tribes called themselves, from very remote times, by the\r\n      generic name of Teutons, (Teuten, Deutschen,) which Tacitus\r\n      derives from that of one of their gods, Tuisco. It appears more\r\n      probable that it means merely men, people. Many savage nations\r\n      have given themselves no other name. Thus the Laplanders call\r\n      themselves Almag, people; the Samoiedes Nilletz, Nissetsch, men,\r\n      &c. As to the name of Germans, (Germani,) Cæsar found it in use\r\n      in Gaul, and adopted it as a word already known to the Romans.\r\n      Many of the learned (from a passage of Tacitus, de Mor Germ. c.\r\n      2) have supposed that it was only applied to the Teutons after\r\n      Cæsar’s time; but Adelung has triumphantly refuted this opinion.\r\n      The name of Germans is found in the Fasti Capitolini. See Gruter,\r\n      Iscrip. 2899, in which the consul Marcellus, in the year of Rome\r\n      531, is said to have defeated the Gauls, the Insubrians, and the\r\n      Germans, commanded by Virdomar.

The considerable changes which have taken place on\r\n      its shores, Mr. Lyell, from actual observation now decidedly\r\n      attributes to the regular and uniform elevation of the\r\n      land.—Lyell’s Geology, b. ii. c. 17—M.]\r\n\r\n      Some ingenious writers 2 have suspected that Europe was much\r\n      colder formerly than it is at present; and the most ancient\r\n      descriptions of the climate of Germany tend exceedingly to\r\n      confirm their theory. The general complaints of intense frost and\r\n      eternal winter are perhaps little to be regarded, since we have\r\n      no method of reducing to the accurate standard of the\r\n      thermometer, the feelings, or the expressions, of an orator born\r\n      in the happier regions of Greece or Asia. But I shall select two\r\n      remarkable circumstances of a less equivocal nature. 1. The great\r\n      rivers which covered the Roman provinces, the Rhine and the\r\n      Danube, were frequently frozen over, and capable of supporting\r\n      the most enormous weights. The barbarians, who often chose that\r\n      severe season for their inroads, transported, without\r\n      apprehension or danger, their numerous armies, their cavalry, and\r\n      their heavy wagons, over a vast and solid bridge of ice. 3 Modern\r\n      ages have not presented an instance of a like phenomenon. 2. The\r\n      reindeer, that useful animal, from whom the savage of the North\r\n      derives the best comforts of his dreary life, is of a\r\n      constitution that supports, and even requires, the most intense\r\n      cold. He is found on the rock of Spitzberg, within ten degrees of\r\n      the Pole; he seems to delight in the snows of Lapland and\r\n      Siberia: but at present he cannot subsist, much less multiply, in\r\n      any country to the south of the Baltic. 4 In the time of Cæsar\r\n      the reindeer, as well as the elk and the wild bull, was a native\r\n      of the Hercynian forest, which then overshadowed a great part of\r\n      Germany and Poland. 5 The modern improvements sufficiently\r\n      explain the causes of the diminution of the cold. These immense\r\n      woods have been gradually cleared, which intercepted from the\r\n      earth the rays of the sun. 6 The morasses have been drained, and,\r\n      in proportion as the soil has been cultivated, the air has become\r\n      more temperate. Canada, at this day, is an exact picture of\r\n      ancient Germany. Although situated in the same parallel with the\r\n      finest provinces of France and England, that country experiences\r\n      the most rigorous cold. The reindeer are very numerous, the\r\n      ground is covered with deep and lasting snow, and the great river\r\n      of St. Lawrence is regularly frozen, in a season when the waters\r\n      of the Seine and the Thames are usually free from ice. 7\r\n\r\n      2 (return) [ In particular, Mr. Hume, the Abbé du Bos, and M.\r\n      Pelloutier.

Many writers have supposed, and most have\r\n      allowed, though, as it should seem, without any adequate proof,\r\n      that the rigorous cold of the North was favorable to long life\r\n      and generative vigor, that the women were more fruitful, and the\r\n      human species more prolific, than in warmer or more temperate\r\n      climates. 8 We may assert, with greater confidence, that the keen\r\n      air of Germany formed the large and masculine limbs of the\r\n      natives, who were, in general, of a more lofty stature than the\r\n      people of the South, 9 gave them a kind of strength better\r\n      adapted to violent exertions than to patient labor, and inspired\r\n      them with constitutional bravery, which is the result of nerves\r\n      and spirits.

When\r\n      Tacitus considered the purity of the German blood, and the\r\n      forbidding aspect of the country, he was disposed to pronounce\r\n      those barbarians _Indigenæ_, or natives of the soil. We may allow\r\n      with safety, and perhaps with truth, that ancient Germany was not\r\n      originally peopled by any foreign colonies already formed into a\r\n      political society; 12 but that the name and nation received their\r\n      existence from the gradual union of some wandering savages of the\r\n      Hercynian woods. To assert those savages to have been the\r\n      spontaneous production of the earth which they inhabited would be\r\n      a rash inference, condemned by religion, and unwarranted by\r\n      reason.\r\n\r\n      12 (return) [ Facit. Germ. c. 3. The emigration of the Gauls\r\n      followed the course of the Danube, and discharged itself on\r\n      Greece and Asia. Tacitus could discover only one inconsiderable\r\n      tribe that retained any traces of a Gallic origin. * Note: The\r\n      Gothini, who must not be confounded with the Gothi, a Suevian\r\n      tribe. In the time of Cæsar many other tribes of Gaulish origin\r\n      dwelt along the course of the Danube, who could not long resist\r\n      the attacks of the Suevi. The Helvetians, who dwelt on the\r\n      borders of the Black Forest, between the Maine and the Danube,\r\n      had been expelled long before the time of Cæsar. He mentions also\r\n      the Volci Tectosagi, who came from Languedoc and settled round\r\n      the Black Forest. The Boii, who had penetrated into that forest,\r\n      and also have left traces of their name in Bohemia, were subdued\r\n      in the first century by the Marcomanni. The Boii settled in\r\n      Noricum, were mingled afterwards with the Lombards, and received\r\n      the name of Boio Arii (Bavaria) or Boiovarii: var, in some German\r\n      dialects, appearing to mean remains, descendants. Compare Malte\r\n      B-m, Geography, vol. i. p. 410, edit 1832—M.]\r\n\r\n      Such rational doubt is but ill suited with the genius of popular\r\n      vanity. Among the nations who have adopted the Mosaic history of\r\n      the world, the ark of Noah has been of the same use, as was\r\n      formerly to the Greeks and Romans the siege of Troy. On a narrow\r\n      basis of acknowledged truth, an immense but rude superstructure\r\n      of fable has been erected; and the wild Irishman, 13 as well as\r\n      the wild Tartar, 14 could point out the individual son of Japhet,\r\n      from whose loins his ancestors were lineally descended. The last\r\n      century abounded with antiquarians of profound learning and easy\r\n      faith, who, by the dim light of legends and traditions, of\r\n      conjectures and etymologies, conducted the great grandchildren of\r\n      Noah from the Tower of Babel to the extremities of the globe. Of\r\n      these judicious critics, one of the most entertaining was Olaus\r\n      Rudbeck, professor in the university of Upsal. 15 Whatever is\r\n      celebrated either in history or fable this zealous patriot\r\n      ascribes to his country. From Sweden (which formed so\r\n      considerable a part of ancient Germany) the Greeks themselves\r\n      derived their alphabetical characters, their astronomy, and their\r\n      religion. Of that delightful region (for such it appeared to the\r\n      eyes of a native) the Atlantis of Plato, the country of the\r\n      Hyperboreans, the gardens of the Hesperides, the Fortunate\r\n      Islands, and even the Elysian Fields, were all but faint and\r\n      imperfect transcripts. A clime so profusely favored by Nature\r\n      could not long remain desert after the flood. The learned Rudbeck\r\n      allows the family of Noah a few years to multiply from eight to\r\n      about twenty thousand persons. He then disperses them into small\r\n      colonies to replenish the earth, and to propagate the human\r\n      species. The German or Swedish detachment (which marched, if I am\r\n      not mistaken, under the command of Askenaz, the son of Gomer, the\r\n      son of Japhet) distinguished itself by a more than common\r\n      diligence in the prosecution of this great work. The northern\r\n      hive cast its swarms over the greatest part of Europe, Africa,\r\n      and Asia; and (to use the author’s metaphor) the blood circulated\r\n      from the extremities to the heart.\r\n\r\n      13 (return) [ According to Dr. Keating, (History of Ireland, p.\r\n      13, 14,) the giant Portholanus, who was the son of Seara, the son\r\n      of Esra, the son of Sru, the son of Framant, the son of\r\n      Fathaclan, the son of Magog, the son of Japhet, the son of Noah,\r\n      landed on the coast of Munster the 14th day of May, in the year\r\n      of the world one thousand nine hundred and seventy-eight.

Without that\r\n      artificial help, the human memory soon dissipates or corrupts the\r\n      ideas intrusted to her charge; and the nobler faculties of the\r\n      mind, no longer supplied with models or with materials, gradually\r\n      forget their powers; the judgment becomes feeble and lethargic,\r\n      the imagination languid or irregular. Fully to apprehend this\r\n      important truth, let us attempt, in an improved society, to\r\n      calculate the immense distance between the man of learning and\r\n      the _illiterate_ peasant. The former, by reading and reflection,\r\n      multiplies his own experience, and lives in distant ages and\r\n      remote countries; whilst the latter, rooted to a single spot, and\r\n      confined to a few years of existence, surpasses but very little\r\n      his fellow-laborer, the ox, in the exercise of his mental\r\n      faculties. The same, and even a greater, difference will be found\r\n      between nations than between individuals; and we may safely\r\n      pronounce, that without some species of writing, no people has\r\n      ever preserved the faithful annals of their history, ever made\r\n      any considerable progress in the abstract sciences, or ever\r\n      possessed, in any tolerable degree of perfection, the useful and\r\n      agreeable arts of life.\r\n\r\n      16 (return) [ Tacit.

We may rest contented with this decisive\r\n      authority, without entering into the obscure disputes concerning\r\n      the antiquity of the Runic characters. The learned Celsius, a\r\n      Swede, a scholar, and a philosopher, was of opinion, that they\r\n      were nothing more than the Roman letters, with the curves changed\r\n      into straight lines for the ease of engraving. See Pelloutier,\r\n      Histoire des Celtes, l. ii. c. 11. Dictionnaire Diplomatique,\r\n      tom. i. p. 223. We may add, that the oldest Runic inscriptions\r\n      are supposed to be of the third century, and the most ancient\r\n      writer who mentions the Runic characters is Venan tius\r\n      Frotunatus, (Carm. vii. 18,) who lived towards the end of the\r\n      sixth century. Barbara fraxineis pingatur Runa tabellis. * Note:\r\n      The obscure subject of the Runic characters has exercised the\r\n      industry and ingenuity of the modern scholars of the north. There\r\n      are three distinct theories; one, maintained by Schlozer,\r\n      (Nordische Geschichte, p. 481, &c.,) who considers their sixteen\r\n      letters to be a corruption of the Roman alphabet, post-Christian\r\n      in their date, and Schlozer would attribute their introduction\r\n      into the north to the Alemanni. The second, that of Frederick\r\n      Schlegel, (Vorlesungen uber alte und neue Literatur,) supposes\r\n      that these characters were left on the coasts of the\r\n      Mediterranean and Northern Seas by the Phœnicians, preserved by\r\n      the priestly castes, and employed for purposes of magic. Their\r\n      common origin from the Phœnician would account for heir\r\n      similarity to the Roman letters. The last, to which we incline,\r\n      claims much higher and more venerable antiquity for the Runic,\r\n      and supposes them to have been the original characters of the\r\n      Indo-Teutonic tribes, brought from the East, and preserved among\r\n      the different races of that stock. See Ueber Deutsche Runen von\r\n      W. C. Grimm, 1821. A Memoir by Dr. Legis. Fundgruben des alten\r\n      Nordens.

Modern Germany is said to\r\n      contain about two thousand three hundred walled towns. 17 In a\r\n      much wider extent of country, the geographer Ptolemy could\r\n      discover no more than ninety places which he decorates with the\r\n      name of cities; 18 though, according to our ideas, they would but\r\n      ill deserve that splendid title. We can only suppose them to have\r\n      been rude fortifications, constructed in the centre of the woods,\r\n      and designed to secure the women, children, and cattle, whilst\r\n      the warriors of the tribe marched out to repel a sudden invasion.\r\n      19 But Tacitus asserts, as a well-known fact, that the Germans,\r\n      in his time, had _no_ cities; 20 and that they affected to\r\n      despise the works of Roman industry, as places of confinement\r\n      rather than of security. 21 Their edifices were not even\r\n      contiguous, or formed into regular villas; 22 each barbarian\r\n      fixed his independent dwelling on the spot to which a plain, a\r\n      wood, or a stream of fresh water, had induced him to give the\r\n      preference. Neither stone, nor brick, nor tiles, were employed in\r\n      these slight habitations. 23 They were indeed no more than low\r\n      huts, of a circular figure, built of rough timber, thatched with\r\n      straw, and pierced at the top to leave a free passage for the\r\n      smoke. In the most inclement winter, the hardy German was\r\n      satisfied with a scanty garment made of the skin of some animal.\r\n      The nations who dwelt towards the North clothed themselves in\r\n      furs; and the women manufactured for their own use a coarse kind\r\n      of linen. 24 The game of various sorts, with which the forests of\r\n      Germany were plentifully stocked, supplied its inhabitants with\r\n      food and exercise. 25 Their monstrous herds of cattle, less\r\n      remarkable indeed for their beauty than for their utility, 26\r\n      formed the principal object of their wealth. A small quantity of\r\n      corn was the only produce exacted from the earth; the use of\r\n      orchards or artificial meadows was unknown to the Germans; nor\r\n      can we expect any improvements in agriculture from a people,\r\n      whose prosperity every year experienced a general change by a new\r\n      division of the arable lands, and who, in that strange operation,\r\n      avoided disputes, by suffering a great part of their territory to\r\n      lie waste and without tillage. 27\r\n\r\n      1601 (return) [ Luden (the author of the Geschichte des Teutschen\r\n      Volkes) has surpassed most writers in his patriotic enthusiasm\r\n      for the virtues and noble manners of his ancestors.

The various transactions of peace and war had introduced\r\n      some Roman coins (chiefly silver) among the borderers of the\r\n      Rhine and Danube; but the more distant tribes were absolutely\r\n      unacquainted with the use of money, carried on their confined\r\n      traffic by the exchange of commodities, and prized their rude\r\n      earthen vessels as of equal value with the silver vases, the\r\n      presents of Rome to their princes and ambassadors. 28 To a mind\r\n      capable of reflection, such leading facts convey more\r\n      instruction, than a tedious detail of subordinate circumstances.\r\n      The value of money has been settled by general consent to express\r\n      our wants and our property, as letters were invented to express\r\n      our ideas; and both these institutions, by giving a more active\r\n      energy to the powers and passions of human nature, have\r\n      contributed to multiply the objects they were designed to\r\n      represent. The use of gold and silver is in a great measure\r\n      factitious; but it would be impossible to enumerate the important\r\n      and various services which agriculture, and all the arts, have\r\n      received from iron, when tempered and fashioned by the operation\r\n      of fire and the dexterous hand of man. Money, in a word, is the\r\n      most universal incitement, iron the most powerful instrument, of\r\n      human industry; and it is very difficult to conceive by what\r\n      means a people, neither actuated by the one, nor seconded by the\r\n      other, could emerge from the grossest barbarism. 29\r\n\r\n      28 (return) [ Tacit. Germ. 6.]\r\n\r\n      29 (return) [ It is said that the Mexicans and Peruvians, without\r\n      the use of either money or iron, had made a very great progress\r\n      in the arts. Those arts, and the monuments they produced, have\r\n      been strangely magnified. See Recherches sur les Americains, tom.\r\n      ii. p. 153, &c]\r\n\r\n      If we contemplate a savage nation in any part of the globe, a\r\n      supine indolence and a carelessness of futurity will be found to\r\n      constitute their general character. In a civilized state every\r\n      faculty of man is expanded and exercised; and the great chain of\r\n      mutual dependence connects and embraces the several members of\r\n      society. The most numerous portion of it is employed in constant\r\n      and useful labor. The select few, placed by fortune above that\r\n      necessity, can, however, fill up their time by the pursuits of\r\n      interest or glory, by the improvement of their estate or of their\r\n      understanding, by the duties, the pleasures, and even the follies\r\n      of social life. The Germans were not possessed of these varied\r\n      resources. The care of the house and family, the management of\r\n      the land and cattle, were delegated to the old and the infirm, to\r\n      women and slaves. The lazy warrior, destitute of every art that\r\n      might employ his leisure hours, consumed his days and nights in\r\n      the animal gratifications of sleep and food. And yet, by a\r\n      wonderful diversity of nature, (according to the remark of a\r\n      writer who had pierced into its darkest recesses,) the same\r\n      barbarians are by turns the most indolent and the most restless\r\n      of mankind. They delight in sloth, they detest tranquility. 30\r\n      The languid soul, oppressed with its own weight, anxiously\r\n      required some new and powerful sensation; and war and danger were\r\n      the only amusements adequate to its fierce temper. The sound that\r\n      summoned the German to arms was grateful to his ear. It roused\r\n      him from his uncomfortable lethargy, gave him an active pursuit,\r\n      and, by strong exercise of the body, and violent emotions of the\r\n      mind, restored him to a more lively sense of his existence. In\r\n      the dull intervals of peace, these barbarians were immoderately\r\n      addicted to deep gaming and excessive drinking; both of which, by\r\n      different means, the one by inflaming their passions, the other\r\n      by extinguishing their reason, alike relieved them from the pain\r\n      of thinking. They gloried in passing whole days and nights at\r\n      table; and the blood of friends and relations often stained their\r\n      numerous and drunken assemblies. 31 Their debts of honor (for in\r\n      that light they have transmitted to us those of play) they\r\n      discharged with the most romantic fidelity. The desperate\r\n      gamester, who had staked his person and liberty on a last throw\r\n      of the dice, patiently submitted to the decision of fortune, and\r\n      suffered himself to be bound, chastised, and sold into remote\r\n      slavery, by his weaker but more lucky antagonist. 32\r\n\r\n      30 (return) [ Tacit.

But those who had tasted the\r\n      rich wines of Italy, and afterwards of Gaul, sighed for that more\r\n      delicious species of intoxication. They attempted not, however,\r\n      (as has since been executed with so much success,) to naturalize\r\n      the vine on the banks of the Rhine and Danube; nor did they\r\n      endeavor to procure by industry the materials of an advantageous\r\n      commerce. To solicit by labor what might be ravished by arms, was\r\n      esteemed unworthy of the German spirit. 33 The intemperate thirst\r\n      of strong liquors often urged the barbarians to invade the\r\n      provinces on which art or nature had bestowed those much envied\r\n      presents. The Tuscan who betrayed his country to the Celtic\r\n      nations, attracted them into Italy by the prospect of the rich\r\n      fruits and delicious wines, the productions of a happier climate.\r\n      34 And in the same manner the German auxiliaries, invited into\r\n      France during the civil wars of the sixteenth century, were\r\n      allured by the promise of plenteous quarters in the provinces of\r\n      Champaigne and Burgundy. 35 Drunkenness, the most illiberal, but\r\n      not the most dangerous of _our_ vices, was sometimes capable, in\r\n      a less civilized state of mankind, of occasioning a battle, a\r\n      war, or a revolution.\r\n\r\n      33 (return) [ Tacit.

The same extent of ground which at present\r\n      maintains, in ease and plenty, a million of husbandmen and\r\n      artificers, was unable to supply a hundred thousand lazy warriors\r\n      with the simple necessaries of life. 36 The Germans abandoned\r\n      their immense forests to the exercise of hunting, employed in\r\n      pasturage the most considerable part of their lands, bestowed on\r\n      the small remainder a rude and careless cultivation, and then\r\n      accused the scantiness and sterility of a country that refused to\r\n      maintain the multitude of its inhabitants. When the return of\r\n      famine severely admonished them of the importance of the arts,\r\n      the national distress was sometimes alleviated by the emigration\r\n      of a third, perhaps, or a fourth part of their youth. 37 The\r\n      possession and the enjoyment of property are the pledges which\r\n      bind a civilized people to an improved country. But the Germans,\r\n      who carried with them what they most valued, their arms, their\r\n      cattle, and their women, cheerfully abandoned the vast silence of\r\n      their woods for the unbounded hopes of plunder and conquest. The\r\n      innumerable swarms that issued, or seemed to issue, from the\r\n      great storehouse of nations, were multiplied by the fears of the\r\n      vanquished, and by the credulity of succeeding ages.

We are only at a loss to conceive\r\n      by what means riches and despotism could penetrate into a remote\r\n      corner of the North, and extinguish the generous flame that\r\n      blazed with such fierceness on the frontier of the Roman\r\n      provinces, or how the ancestors of those Danes and Norwegians, so\r\n      distinguished in latter ages by their unconquered spirit, could\r\n      thus tamely resign the great character of German liberty. 42 Some\r\n      tribes, however, on the coast of the Baltic, acknowledged the\r\n      authority of kings, though without relinquishing the rights of\r\n      men, 43 but in the far greater part of Germany, the form of\r\n      government was a democracy, tempered, indeed, and controlled, not\r\n      so much by general and positive laws, as by the occasional\r\n      ascendant of birth or valor, of eloquence or superstition. 44\r\n\r\n      41 (return) [ Tacit.

The German\r\n      tribes were contented with this rude but liberal outline of\r\n      political society. As soon as a youth, born of free parents, had\r\n      attained the age of manhood, he was introduced into the general\r\n      council of his countrymen, solemnly invested with a shield and\r\n      spear, and adopted as an equal and worthy member of the military\r\n      commonwealth. The assembly of the warriors of the tribe was\r\n      convened at stated seasons, or on sudden emergencies. The trial\r\n      of public offences, the election of magistrates, and the great\r\n      business of peace and war, were determined by its independent\r\n      voice. Sometimes indeed, these important questions were\r\n      previously considered and prepared in a more select council of\r\n      the principal chieftains. 45 The magistrates might deliberate and\r\n      persuade, the people only could resolve and execute; and the\r\n      resolutions of the Germans were for the most part hasty and\r\n      violent. Barbarians accustomed to place their freedom in\r\n      gratifying the present passion, and their courage in overlooking\r\n      all future consequences, turned away with indignant contempt from\r\n      the remonstrances of justice and policy, and it was the practice\r\n      to signify by a hollow murmur their dislike of such timid\r\n      counsels. But whenever a more popular orator proposed to\r\n      vindicate the meanest citizen from either foreign or domestic\r\n      injury, whenever he called upon his fellow-countrymen to assert\r\n      the national honor, or to pursue some enterprise full of danger\r\n      and glory, a loud clashing of shields and spears expressed the\r\n      eager applause of the assembly. For the Germans always met in\r\n      arms, and it was constantly to be dreaded, lest an irregular\r\n      multitude, inflamed with faction and strong liquors, should use\r\n      those arms to enforce, as well as to declare, their furious\r\n      resolves. We may recollect how often the diets of Poland have\r\n      been polluted with blood, and the more numerous party has been\r\n      compelled to yield to the more violent and seditious. 46\r\n\r\n      45 (return) [ Grotius changes an expression of Tacitus,\r\n      pertractantur into Prætractantur.

The most obscure soldier resisted with disdain the\r\n      authority of the magistrates. “The noblest youths blushed not to\r\n      be numbered among the faithful companions of some renowned chief,\r\n      to whom they devoted their arms and service. A noble emulation\r\n      prevailed among the companions to obtain the first place in the\r\n      esteem of their chief; amongst the chiefs, to acquire the\r\n      greatest number of valiant companions. To be ever surrounded by a\r\n      band of select youths was the pride and strength of the chiefs,\r\n      their ornament in peace, their defence in war. The glory of such\r\n      distinguished heroes diffused itself beyond the narrow limits of\r\n      their own tribe. Presents and embassies solicited their\r\n      friendship, and the fame of their arms often insured victory to\r\n      the party which they espoused. In the hour of danger it was\r\n      shameful for the chief to be surpassed in valor by his\r\n      companions; shameful for the companions not to equal the valor of\r\n      their chief. To survive his fall in battle was indelible infamy.\r\n      To protect his person, and to adorn his glory with the trophies\r\n      of their own exploits, were the most sacred of their duties. The\r\n      chiefs combated for victory, the companions for the chief. The\r\n      noblest warriors, whenever their native country was sunk into the\r\n      laziness of peace, maintained their numerous bands in some\r\n      distant scene of action, to exercise their restless spirit, and\r\n      to acquire renown by voluntary dangers. Gifts worthy of\r\n      soldiers—the warlike steed, the bloody and ever victorious\r\n      lance—were the rewards which the companions claimed from the\r\n      liberality of their chief. The rude plenty of his hospitable\r\n      board was the only pay that _he_ could bestow, or _they_ would\r\n      accept. War, rapine, and the free-will offerings of his friends,\r\n      supplied the materials of this munificence.” 53 This institution,\r\n      however it might accidentally weaken the several republics,\r\n      invigorated the general character of the Germans, and even\r\n      ripened amongst them all the virtues of which barbarians are\r\n      susceptible; the faith and valor, the hospitality and the\r\n      courtesy, so conspicuous long afterwards in the ages of chivalry.\r\n\r\n      The honorable gifts, bestowed by the chief on his brave\r\n      companions, have been supposed, by an ingenious writer, to\r\n      contain the first rudiments of the fiefs, distributed after the\r\n      conquest of the Roman provinces, by the barbarian lords among\r\n      their vassals, with a similar duty of homage and military\r\n      service. 54 These conditions are, however, very repugnant to the\r\n      maxims of the ancient Germans, who delighted in mutual presents,\r\n      but without either imposing, or accepting, the weight of\r\n      obligations. 55\r\n\r\n      53 (return) [ Tacit.

The\r\n      gross appetite of love becomes most dangerous when it is\r\n      elevated, or rather, indeed, disguised by sentimental passion.\r\n      The elegance of dress, of motion, and of manners, gives a lustre\r\n      to beauty, and inflames the senses through the imagination.\r\n      Luxurious entertainments, midnight dances, and licentious\r\n      spectacles, present at once temptation and opportunity to female\r\n      frailty. 57 From such dangers the unpolished wives of the\r\n      barbarians were secured by poverty, solitude, and the painful\r\n      cares of a domestic life. The German huts, open, on every side,\r\n      to the eye of indiscretion or jealousy, were a better safeguard\r\n      of conjugal fidelity than the walls, the bolts, and the eunuchs\r\n      of a Persian harem. To this reason another may be added of a more\r\n      honorable nature. The Germans treated their women with esteem and\r\n      confidence, consulted them on every occasion of importance, and\r\n      fondly believed, that in their breasts resided a sanctity and\r\n      wisdom more than human. Some of the interpreters of fate, such as\r\n      Velleda, in the Batavian war, governed, in the name of the deity,\r\n      the fiercest nations of Germany. 58 The rest of the sex, without\r\n      being adored as goddesses, were respected as the free and equal\r\n      companions of soldiers; associated even by the marriage ceremony\r\n      to a life of toil, of danger, and of glory. 59 In their great\r\n      invasions, the camps of the barbarians were filled with a\r\n      multitude of women, who remained firm and undaunted amidst the\r\n      sound of arms, the various forms of destruction, and the\r\n      honorable wounds of their sons and husbands. 60 Fainting armies\r\n      of Germans have, more than once, been driven back upon the enemy\r\n      by the generous despair of the women, who dreaded death much less\r\n      than servitude. If the day was irrecoverably lost, they well knew\r\n      how to deliver themselves and their children, with their own\r\n      hands, from an insulting victor. 61 Heroines of such a cast may\r\n      claim our admiration; but they were most assuredly neither lovely\r\n      nor very susceptible of love. Whilst they affected to emulate the\r\n      stern virtues of _man_, they must have resigned that attractive\r\n      softness in which principally consist the charm and weakness of\r\n      _woman_. Conscious pride taught the German females to suppress\r\n      every tender emotion that stood in competition with honor, and\r\n      the first honor of the sex has ever been that of chastity. The\r\n      sentiments and conduct of these high-spirited matrons may, at\r\n      once, be considered as a cause, as an effect, and as a proof of\r\n      the general character of the nation. Female courage, however it\r\n      may be raised by fanaticism, or confirmed by habit, can be only a\r\n      faint and imperfect imitation of the manly valor that\r\n      distinguishes the age or country in which it may be found.\r\n\r\n      57 (return) [ Ovid employs two hundred lines in the research of\r\n      places the most favorable to love.

They were persuaded, that, by some ridiculous arts of\r\n      divination, they could discover the will of the superior beings,\r\n      and that human sacrifices were the most precious and acceptable\r\n      offering to their altars. Some applause has been hastily bestowed\r\n      on the sublime notion, entertained by that people, of the Deity,\r\n      whom they neither confined within the walls of the temple, nor\r\n      represented by any human figure; but when we recollect, that the\r\n      Germans were unskilled in architecture, and totally unacquainted\r\n      with the art of sculpture, we shall readily assign the true\r\n      reason of a scruple, which arose not so much from a superiority\r\n      of reason, as from a want of ingenuity. The only temples in\r\n      Germany were dark and ancient groves, consecrated by the\r\n      reverence of succeeding generations. Their secret gloom, the\r\n      imagined residence of an invisible power, by presenting no\r\n      distinct object of fear or worship, impressed the mind with a\r\n      still deeper sense of religious horror; 63 and the priests, rude\r\n      and illiterate as they were, had been taught by experience the\r\n      use of every artifice that could preserve and fortify impressions\r\n      so well suited to their own interest.\r\n\r\n      62 (return) [ Tacitus has employed a few lines, and Cluverius one\r\n      hundred and twenty-four pages, on this obscure subject.

The\r\n      German priests, improving this favorable temper of their\r\n      countrymen, had assumed a jurisdiction even in temporal concerns,\r\n      which the magistrate could not venture to exercise; and the\r\n      haughty warrior patiently submitted to the lash of correction,\r\n      when it was inflicted, not by any human power, but by the\r\n      immediate order of the god of war. 64 The defects of civil policy\r\n      were sometimes supplied by the interposition of ecclesiastical\r\n      authority. The latter was constantly exerted to maintain silence\r\n      and decency in the popular assemblies; and was sometimes extended\r\n      to a more enlarged concern for the national welfare. A solemn\r\n      procession was occasionally celebrated in the present countries\r\n      of Mecklenburgh and Pomerania. The unknown symbol of the _Earth_,\r\n      covered with a thick veil, was placed on a carriage drawn by\r\n      cows; and in this manner the goddess, whose common residence was\r\n      in the Isles of Rugen, visited several adjacent tribes of her\r\n      worshippers. During her progress the sound of war was hushed,\r\n      quarrels were suspended, arms laid aside, and the restless\r\n      Germans had an opportunity of tasting the blessings of peace and\r\n      harmony. 65 The _truce of God_, so often and so ineffectually\r\n      proclaimed by the clergy of the eleventh century, was an obvious\r\n      imitation of this ancient custom. 66\r\n\r\n      64 (return) [ Tacit.

Interest\r\n      and fanaticism often prompted its ministers to sanctify the most\r\n      daring and the most unjust enterprises, by the approbation of\r\n      Heaven, and full assurances of success. The consecrated\r\n      standards, long revered in the groves of superstition, were\r\n      placed in the front of the battle; 67 and the hostile army was\r\n      devoted with dire execrations to the gods of war and of thunder.\r\n      68 In the faith of soldiers (and such were the Germans) cowardice\r\n      is the most unpardonable of sins. A brave man was the worthy\r\n      favorite of their martial deities; the wretch who had lost his\r\n      shield was alike banished from the religious and civil assemblies\r\n      of his countrymen. Some tribes of the north seem to have embraced\r\n      the doctrine of transmigration, 69 others imagined a gross\r\n      paradise of immortal drunkenness. 70 All agreed that a life spent\r\n      in arms, and a glorious death in battle, were the best\r\n      preparations for a happy futurity, either in this or in another\r\n      world.\r\n\r\n      67 (return) [ Tacit.

That singular order of men has\r\n      most deservedly attracted the notice of all who have attempted to\r\n      investigate the antiquities of the Celts, the Scandinavians, and\r\n      the Germans. Their genius and character, as well as the reverence\r\n      paid to that important office, have been sufficiently\r\n      illustrated. But we cannot so easily express, or even conceive,\r\n      the enthusiasm of arms and glory which they kindled in the breast\r\n      of their audience. Among a polished people a taste for poetry is\r\n      rather an amusement of the fancy than a passion of the soul. And\r\n      yet, when in calm retirement we peruse the combats described by\r\n      Homer or Tasso, we are insensibly seduced by the fiction, and\r\n      feel a momentary glow of martial ardor. But how faint, how cold\r\n      is the sensation which a peaceful mind can receive from solitary\r\n      study! It was in the hour of battle, or in the feast of victory,\r\n      that the bards celebrated the glory of the heroes of ancient\r\n      days, the ancestors of those warlike chieftains, who listened\r\n      with transport to their artless but animated strains. The view of\r\n      arms and of danger heightened the effect of the military song;\r\n      and the passions which it tended to excite, the desire of fame,\r\n      and the contempt of death, were the habitual sentiments of a\r\n      German mind. 71 711\r\n\r\n      71 (return) [ See Tacit.

The same\r\n      honor was paid to the remains of Attila. Ibid. c. 49. According\r\n      to some historians, the Germans had songs also at their weddings;\r\n      but this appears to me inconsistent with their customs, in which\r\n      marriage was no more than the purchase of a wife. Besides, there\r\n      is but one instance of this, that of the Gothic king, Ataulph,\r\n      who sang himself the nuptial hymn when he espoused Placidia,\r\n      sister of the emperors Arcadius and Honorius, (Olympiodor. p. 8.)\r\n      But this marriage was celebrated according to the Roman rites, of\r\n      which the nuptial songs formed a part.

Mag.—M.]\r\n\r\n      Such was the situation, and such were the manners of the ancient\r\n      Germans. Their climate, their want of learning, of arts, and of\r\n      laws, their notions of honor, of gallantry, and of religion,\r\n      their sense of freedom, impatience of peace, and thirst of\r\n      enterprise, all contributed to form a people of military heroes.\r\n      And yet we find, that during more than two hundred and fifty\r\n      years that elapsed from the defeat of Varus to the reign of\r\n      Decius, these formidable barbarians made few considerable\r\n      attempts, and not any material impression on the luxurious, and\r\n      enslaved provinces of the empire. Their progress was checked by\r\n      their want of arms and discipline, and their fury was diverted by\r\n      the intestine divisions of ancient Germany. I. It has been\r\n      observed, with ingenuity, and not without truth, that the command\r\n      of iron soon gives a nation the command of gold. But the rude\r\n      tribes of Germany, alike destitute of both those valuable metals,\r\n      were reduced slowly to acquire, by their unassisted strength, the\r\n      possession of the one as well as the other. The face of a German\r\n      army displayed their poverty of iron. Swords, and the longer kind\r\n      of lances, they could seldom use. Their _frameæ_ (as they called\r\n      them in their own language) were long spears headed with a sharp\r\n      but narrow iron point, and which, as occasion required, they\r\n      either darted from a distance, or pushed in close onset. With\r\n      this spear, and with a shield, their cavalry was contented. A\r\n      multitude of darts, scattered 72 with incredible force, were an\r\n      additional resource of the infantry. Their military dress, when\r\n      they wore any, was nothing more than a loose mantle. A variety of\r\n      colors was the only ornament of their wooden or osier shields.\r\n      Few of the chiefs were distinguished by cuirasses, scarcely any\r\n      by helmets. Though the horses of Germany were neither beautiful,\r\n      swift, nor practised in the skilful evolutions of the Roman\r\n      manege, several of the nations obtained renown by their cavalry;\r\n      but, in general, the principal strength of the Germans consisted\r\n      in their infantry, 73 which was drawn up in several deep columns,\r\n      according to the distinction of tribes and families. Impatient of\r\n      fatigue and delay, these half-armed warriors rushed to battle\r\n      with dissonant shouts and disordered ranks; and sometimes, by the\r\n      effort of native valor, prevailed over the constrained and more\r\n      artificial bravery of the Roman mercenaries. But as the\r\n      barbarians poured forth their whole souls on the first onset,\r\n      they knew not how to rally or to retire. A repulse was a sure\r\n      defeat; and a defeat was most commonly total destruction. When we\r\n      recollect the complete armor of the Roman soldiers, their\r\n      discipline, exercises, evolutions, fortified camps, and military\r\n      engines, it appears a just matter of surprise, how the naked and\r\n      unassisted valor of the barbarians could dare to encounter, in\r\n      the field, the strength of the legions, and the various troops of\r\n      the auxiliaries, which seconded their operations. The contest was\r\n      too unequal, till the introduction of luxury had enervated the\r\n      vigor, and a spirit of disobedience and sedition had relaxed the\r\n      discipline, of the Roman armies. The introduction of barbarian\r\n      auxiliaries into those armies, was a measure attended with very\r\n      obvious dangers, as it might gradually instruct the Germans in\r\n      the arts of war and of policy. Although they were admitted in\r\n      small numbers and with the strictest precaution, the example of\r\n      Civilis was proper to convince the Romans, that the danger was\r\n      not imaginary, and that their precautions were not always\r\n      sufficient. 74 During the civil wars that followed the death of\r\n      Nero, that artful and intrepid Batavian, whom his enemies\r\n      condescended to compare with Hannibal and Sertorius, 75 formed a\r\n      great design of freedom and ambition. Eight Batavian cohorts\r\n      renowned in the wars of Britain and Italy, repaired to his\r\n      standard. He introduced an army of Germans into Gaul, prevailed\r\n      on the powerful cities of Treves and Langres to embrace his\r\n      cause, defeated the legions, destroyed their fortified camps, and\r\n      employed against the Romans the military knowledge which he had\r\n      acquired in their service. When at length, after an obstinate\r\n      struggle, he yielded to the power of the empire, Civilis secured\r\n      himself and his country by an honorable treaty. The Batavians\r\n      still continued to occupy the islands of the Rhine, 76 the\r\n      allies, not the servants, of the Roman monarchy.\r\n\r\n      72 (return) [ Missilia spargunt, Tacit.

The strength of ancient Germany appears formidable, when we\r\n      consider the effects that might have been produced by its united\r\n      effort. The wide extent of country might very possibly contain a\r\n      million of warriors, as all who were of age to bear arms were of\r\n      a temper to use them. But this fierce multitude, incapable of\r\n      concerting or executing any plan of national greatness, was\r\n      agitated by various and often hostile intentions. Germany was\r\n      divided into more than forty independent states; and, even in\r\n      each state, the union of the several tribes was extremely loose\r\n      and precarious. The barbarians were easily provoked; they knew\r\n      not how to forgive an injury, much less an insult; their\r\n      resentments were bloody and implacable. The casual disputes that\r\n      so frequently happened in their tumultuous parties of hunting or\r\n      drinking were sufficient to inflame the minds of whole nations;\r\n      the private feuds of any considerable chieftains diffused itself\r\n      among their followers and allies. To chastise the insolent, or to\r\n      plunder the defenceless, were alike causes of war. The most\r\n      formidable states of Germany affected to encompass their\r\n      territories with a wide frontier of solitude and devastation. The\r\n      awful distance preserved by their neighbors attested the terror\r\n      of their arms, and in some measure defended them from the danger\r\n      of unexpected incursions. 77\r\n\r\n      77 (return) [ Cæsar de Bell. Gal. l. vi. 23.]\r\n\r\n      “The Bructeri 771 (it is Tacitus who now speaks) were totally\r\n      exterminated by the neighboring tribes, 78 provoked by their\r\n      insolence, allured by the hopes of spoil, and perhaps inspired by\r\n      the tutelar deities of the empire. Above sixty thousand\r\n      barbarians were destroyed; not by the Roman arms, but in our\r\n      sight, and for our entertainment. May the nations, enemies of\r\n      Rome, ever preserve this enmity to each other! We have now\r\n      attained the utmost verge of prosperity, 79 and have nothing left\r\n      to demand of fortune, except the discord of the barbarians.”\r\n      80—These sentiments, less worthy of the humanity than of the\r\n      patriotism of Tacitus, express the invariable maxims of the\r\n      policy of his countrymen. They deemed it a much safer expedient\r\n      to divide than to combat the barbarians, from whose defeat they\r\n      could derive neither honor nor advantage. The money and\r\n      negotiations of Rome insinuated themselves into the heart of\r\n      Germany; and every art of seduction was used with dignity, to\r\n      conciliate those nations whom their proximity to the Rhine or\r\n      Danube might render the most useful friends as well as the most\r\n      troublesome enemies. Chiefs of renown and power were flattered by\r\n      the most trifling presents, which they received either as marks\r\n      of distinction, or as the instruments of luxury. In civil\r\n      dissensions the weaker faction endeavored to strengthen its\r\n      interest by entering into secret connections with the governors\r\n      of the frontier provinces. Every quarrel among the Germans was\r\n      fomented by the intrigues of Rome; and every plan of union and\r\n      public good was defeated by the stronger bias of private jealousy\r\n      and interest. 81\r\n\r\n      771 (return) [ The Bructeri were a non-Suevian tribe, who dwelt\r\n      below the duchies of Oldenburgh, and Lauenburgh, on the borders\r\n      of the Lippe, and in the Hartz Mountains.

This dangerous invasion required all the\r\n      firmness and vigilance of Marcus.

As the ancient, or as new tribes\r\n      successively present themselves in the series of this history, we\r\n      shall concisely mention their origin, their situation, and their\r\n      particular character. Modern nations are fixed and permanent\r\n      societies, connected among themselves by laws and government,\r\n      bound to their native soil by art and agriculture. The German\r\n      tribes were voluntary and fluctuating associations of soldiers,\r\n      almost of savages. The same territory often changed its\r\n      inhabitants in the tide of conquest and emigration. The same\r\n      communities, uniting in a plan of defence or invasion, bestowed a\r\n      new title on their new confederacy. The dissolution of an ancient\r\n      confederacy restored to the independent tribes their peculiar but\r\n      long-forgotten appellation. A victorious state often communicated\r\n      its own name to a vanquished people. Sometimes crowds of\r\n      volunteers flocked from all parts to the standard of a favorite\r\n      leader; his camp became their country, and some circumstance of\r\n      the enterprise soon gave a common denomination to the mixed\r\n      multitude. The distinctions of the ferocious invaders were\r\n      perpetually varied by themselves, and confounded by the\r\n      astonished subjects of the Roman empire. 86\r\n\r\n      86 (return) [ See an excellent dissertation on the origin and\r\n      migrations of nations, in the Memoires de l’Academie des\r\n      Inscriptions, tom. xviii. p. 48—71.

The irregular divisions, and the restless motions, of the\r\n      people of Germany, dazzle our imagination, and seem to multiply\r\n      their numbers. The profuse enumeration of kings, of warriors, of\r\n      armies and nations, inclines us to forget that the same objects\r\n      are continually repeated under a variety of appellations, and\r\n      that the most splendid appellations have been frequently lavished\r\n      on the most inconsiderable objects.\r\n\r\n      87 (return) [ Should we suspect that Athens contained only 21,000\r\n      citizens, and Sparta no more than 39,000?

During that calamitous period, every instant of time\r\n      was marked, every province of the Roman world was afflicted, by\r\n      barbarous invaders, and military tyrants, and the ruined empire\r\n      seemed to approach the last and fatal moment of its dissolution.\r\n      The confusion of the times, and the scarcity of authentic\r\n      memorials, oppose equal difficulties to the historian, who\r\n      attempts to preserve a clear and unbroken thread of narration.\r\n      Surrounded with imperfect fragments, always concise, often\r\n      obscure, and sometimes contradictory, he is reduced to collect,\r\n      to compare, and to conjecture: and though he ought never to place\r\n      his conjectures in the rank of facts, yet the knowledge of human\r\n      nature, and of the sure operation of its fierce and unrestrained\r\n      passions, might, on some occasions, supply the want of historical\r\n      materials.\r\n\r\n      There is not, for instance, any difficulty in conceiving, that\r\n      the successive murders of so many emperors had loosened all the\r\n      ties of allegiance between the prince and people; that all the\r\n      generals of Philip were disposed to imitate the example of their\r\n      master; and that the caprice of armies, long since habituated to\r\n      frequent and violent revolutions, might every day raise to the\r\n      throne the most obscure of their fellow-soldiers. History can\r\n      only add, that the rebellion against the emperor Philip broke out\r\n      in the summer of the year two hundred and forty-nine, among the\r\n      legions of Mæsia; and that a subaltern officer, 1 named Marinus,\r\n      was the object of their seditious choice. Philip was alarmed. He\r\n      dreaded lest the treason of the Mæsian army should prove the\r\n      first spark of a general conflagration. Distracted with the\r\n      consciousness of his guilt and of his danger, he communicated the\r\n      intelligence to the senate. A gloomy silence prevailed, the\r\n      effect of fear, and perhaps of disaffection; till at length\r\n      Decius, one of the assembly, assuming a spirit worthy of his\r\n      noble extraction, ventured to discover more intrepidity than the\r\n      emperor seemed to possess. He treated the whole business with\r\n      contempt, as a hasty and inconsiderate tumult, and Philip’s rival\r\n      as a phantom of royalty, who in a very few days would be\r\n      destroyed by the same inconstancy that had created him. The\r\n      speedy completion of the prophecy inspired Philip with a just\r\n      esteem for so able a counsellor; and Decius appeared to him the\r\n      only person capable of restoring peace and discipline to an army\r\n      whose tumultuous spirit did not immediately subside after the\r\n      murder of Marinus. Decius, 2 who long resisted his own\r\n      nomination, seems to have insinuated the danger of presenting a\r\n      leader of merit to the angry and apprehensive minds of the\r\n      soldiers; and his prediction was again confirmed by the event.\r\n      The legions of Mæsia forced their judge to become their\r\n      accomplice. They left him only the alternative of death or the\r\n      purple. His subsequent conduct, after that decisive measure, was\r\n      unavoidable. He conducted, or followed, his army to the confines\r\n      of Italy, whither Philip, collecting all his force to repel the\r\n      formidable competitor whom he had raised up, advanced to meet\r\n      him. The Imperial troops were superior in number; but the rebels\r\n      formed an army of veterans, commanded by an able and experienced\r\n      leader. Philip was either killed in the battle, or put to death a\r\n      few days afterwards at Verona. His son and associate in the\r\n      empire was massacred at Rome by the Prætorian guards; and the\r\n      victorious Decius, with more favorable circumstances than the\r\n      ambition of that age can usually plead, was universally\r\n      acknowledged by the senate and provinces. It is reported, that,\r\n      immediately after his reluctant acceptance of the title of\r\n      Augustus, he had assured Philip, by a private message, of his\r\n      innocence and loyalty, solemnly protesting, that, on his arrival\r\n      on Italy, he would resign the Imperial ornaments, and return to\r\n      the condition of an obedient subject. His professions might be\r\n      sincere; but in the situation where fortune had placed him, it\r\n      was scarcely possible that he could either forgive or be\r\n      forgiven. 3\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ The expression used by Zosimus and Zonaras may\r\n      signify that Marinus commanded a century, a cohort, or a legion.]\r\n\r\n      2 (return) [ His birth at Bubalia, a little village in Pannonia,\r\n      (Eutrop. ix.

This is the\r\n      first considerable occasion in which history mentions that great\r\n      people, who afterwards broke the Roman power, sacked the Capitol,\r\n      and reigned in Gaul, Spain, and Italy. So memorable was the part\r\n      which they acted in the subversion of the Western empire, that\r\n      the name of Goths is frequently but improperly used as a general\r\n      appellation of rude and warlike barbarism.\r\n\r\n      In the beginning of the sixth century, and after the conquest of\r\n      Italy, the Goths, in possession of present greatness, very\r\n      naturally indulged themselves in the prospect of past and of\r\n      future glory. They wished to preserve the memory of their\r\n      ancestors, and to transmit to posterity their own achievements.\r\n      The principal minister of the court of Ravenna, the learned\r\n      Cassiodorus, gratified the inclination of the conquerors in a\r\n      Gothic history, which consisted of twelve books, now reduced to\r\n      the imperfect abridgment of Jornandes. 4 These writers passed\r\n      with the most artful conciseness over the misfortunes of the\r\n      nation, celebrated its successful valor, and adorned the triumph\r\n      with many Asiatic trophies, that more properly belonged to the\r\n      people of Scythia. On the faith of ancient songs, the uncertain,\r\n      but the only memorials of barbarians, they deduced the first\r\n      origin of the Goths from the vast island, or peninsula, of\r\n      Scandinavia. 5 501 That extreme country of the North was not\r\n      unknown to the conquerors of Italy: the ties of ancient\r\n      consanguinity had been strengthened by recent offices of\r\n      friendship; and a Scandinavian king had cheerfully abdicated his\r\n      savage greatness, that he might pass the remainder of his days in\r\n      the peaceful and polished court of Ravenna. 6 Many vestiges,\r\n      which cannot be ascribed to the arts of popular vanity, attest\r\n      the ancient residence of the Goths in the countries beyond the\r\n      Rhine. From the time of the geographer Ptolemy, the southern part\r\n      of Sweden seems to have continued in the possession of the less\r\n      enterprising remnant of the nation, and a large territory is even\r\n      at present divided into east and west Gothland. During the middle\r\n      ages, (from the ninth to the twelfth century,) whilst\r\n      Christianity was advancing with a slow progress into the North,\r\n      the Goths and the Swedes composed two distinct and sometimes\r\n      hostile members of the same monarchy. 7 The latter of these two\r\n      names has prevailed without extinguishing the former. The Swedes,\r\n      who might well be satisfied with their own fame in arms, have, in\r\n      every age, claimed the kindred glory of the Goths. In a moment of\r\n      discontent against the court of Rome, Charles the Twelfth\r\n      insinuated, that his victorious troops were not degenerated from\r\n      their brave ancestors, who had already subdued the mistress of\r\n      the world. 8\r\n\r\n      4 (return) [ See the prefaces of Cassiodorus and Jornandes; it is\r\n      surprising that the latter should be omitted in the excellent\r\n      edition, published by Grotius, of the Gothic writers.]\r\n\r\n      5 (return) [ On the authority of Ablavius, Jornandes quotes some\r\n      old Gothic chronicles in verse.

This great nation was anciently of\r\n      the Suevian race; it occupied, in the time of Tacitus, and long\r\n      before, Mecklenburgh, Pomerania Southern Prussia and the\r\n      north-west of Poland. A little before the birth of J. C., and in\r\n      the first years of that century, they belonged to the kingdom of\r\n      Marbod, king of the Marcomanni: but Cotwalda, a young Gothic\r\n      prince, delivered them from that tyranny, and established his own\r\n      power over the kingdom of the Marcomanni, already much weakened\r\n      by the victories of Tiberius. The power of the Goths at that time\r\n      must have been great: it was probably from them that the Sinus\r\n      Codanus (the Baltic) took this name, as it was afterwards called\r\n      Mare Suevicum, and Mare Venedicum, during the superiority of the\r\n      proper Suevi and the Venedi. The epoch in which the Goths passed\r\n      into Scandinavia is unknown. See Adelung, Hist. of Anc. Germany,\r\n      p. 200. Gatterer, Hist. Univ. 458.—G. ——M. St. Martin observes,\r\n      that the Scandinavian descent of the Goths rests on the authority\r\n      of Jornandes, who professed to derive it from the traditions of\r\n      the Goths. He is supported by Procopius and Paulus Diaconus. Yet\r\n      the Goths are unquestionably the same with the Getæ of the\r\n      earlier historians. St. Martin, note on Le Beau, Hist. du bas\r\n      Empire, iii. 324. The identity of the Getæ and Goths is by no\r\n      means generally admitted. On the whole, they seem to be one vast\r\n      branch of the Indo-Teutonic race, who spread irregularly towards\r\n      the north of Europe, and at different periods, and in different\r\n      regions, came in contact with the more civilized nations of the\r\n      south. At this period, there seems to have been a reflux of these\r\n      Gothic tribes from the North. Malte Brun considers that there are\r\n      strong grounds for receiving the Islandic traditions commented by\r\n      the Danish Varro, M. Suhm. From these, and the voyage of Pytheas,\r\n      which Malte Brun considers genuine, the Goths were in possession\r\n      of Scandinavia, Ey-Gothland, 250 years before J. C., and of a\r\n      tract on the continent (Reid-Gothland) between the mouths of the\r\n      Vistula and the Oder.

That Odin, yielding with indignant fury to a power he\r\n      was unable to resist, conducted his tribe from the frontiers of\r\n      the Asiatic Sarmatia into Sweden, with the great design of\r\n      forming, in that inaccessible retreat of freedom, a religion and\r\n      a people which, in some remote age, might be subservient to his\r\n      immortal revenge; when his invincible Goths, armed with martial\r\n      fanaticism, should issue in numerous swarms from the neighborhood\r\n      of the Polar circle, to chastise the oppressors of mankind. 12\r\n\r\n      11 (return) [ Mallet, c. iv. p. 55, has collected from Strabo,\r\n      Pliny, Ptolemy, and Stephanus Byzantinus, the vestiges of such a\r\n      city and people.]\r\n\r\n      12 (return) [ This wonderful expedition of Odin, which, by\r\n      deducting the enmity of the Goths and Romans from so memorable a\r\n      cause, might supply the noble groundwork of an epic poem, cannot\r\n      safely be received as authentic history. According to the obvious\r\n      sense of the Edda, and the interpretation of the most skilful\r\n      critics, As-gard, instead of denoting a real city of the Asiatic\r\n      Sarmatia, is the fictitious appellation of the mystic abode of\r\n      the gods, the Olympus of Scandinavia; from whence the prophet was\r\n      supposed to descend, when he announced his new religion to the\r\n      Gothic nations, who were already seated in the southern parts of\r\n      Sweden. * Note: A curious letter may be consulted on this subject\r\n      from the Swede, Ihre counsellor in the Chancery of Upsal, printed\r\n      at Upsal by Edman, in 1772 and translated into German by M.\r\n      Schlozer. Gottingen, printed for Dietericht, 1779.—G. ——Gibbon,\r\n      at a later period of his work, recanted his opinion of the truth\r\n      of this expedition of Odin. The Asiatic origin of the Goths is\r\n      almost certain from the affinity of their language to the\r\n      Sanscrit and Persian; but their northern writers, when all\r\n      mythology was reduced to hero worship.—M.]\r\n\r\n      If so many successive generations of Goths were capable of\r\n      preserving a faint tradition of their Scandinavian origin, we\r\n      must not expect, from such unlettered barbarians, any distinct\r\n      account of the time and circumstances of their emigration. To\r\n      cross the Baltic was an easy and natural attempt. The inhabitants\r\n      of Sweden were masters of a sufficient number of large vessels,\r\n      with oars, 13 and the distance is little more than one hundred\r\n      miles from Carlscroon to the nearest ports of Pomerania and\r\n      Prussia. Here, at length, we land on firm and historic ground. At\r\n      least as early as the Christian æra, 14 and as late as the age of\r\n      the Antonines, 15 the Goths were established towards the mouth of\r\n      the Vistula, and in that fertile province where the commercial\r\n      cities of Thorn, Elbing, Köningsberg, and Dantzick, were long\r\n      afterwards founded. 16 Westward of the Goths, the numerous tribes\r\n      of the Vandals were spread along the banks of the Oder, and the\r\n      sea-coast of Pomerania and Mecklenburgh. A striking resemblance\r\n      of manners, complexion, religion, and language, seemed to\r\n      indicate that the Vandals and the Goths were originally one great\r\n      people. 17 The latter appear to have been subdivided into\r\n      Ostrogoths, Visigoths, and Gepidæ. 18 The distinction among the\r\n      Vandals was more strongly marked by the independent names of\r\n      Heruli, Burgundians, Lombards, and a variety of other petty\r\n      states, many of which, in a future age, expanded themselves into\r\n      powerful monarchies. 181\r\n\r\n      13 (return) [ Tacit.

The Vandals\r\n      and the Goths equally belonged to the great division of the\r\n      Suevi, but the two tribes were very different. Those who have\r\n      treated on this part of history, appear to me to have neglected\r\n      to remark that the ancients almost always gave the name of the\r\n      dominant and conquering people to all the weaker and conquered\r\n      races. So Pliny calls Vindeli, Vandals, all the people of the\r\n      north-east of Europe, because at that epoch the Vandals were\r\n      doubtless the conquering tribe. Cæsar, on the contrary, ranges\r\n      under the name of Suevi, many of the tribes whom Pliny reckons as\r\n      Vandals, because the Suevi, properly so called, were then the\r\n      most powerful tribe in Germany. When the Goths, become in their\r\n      turn conquerors, had subjugated the nations whom they encountered\r\n      on their way, these nations lost their name with their liberty,\r\n      and became of Gothic origin. The Vandals themselves were then\r\n      considered as Goths; the Heruli, the Gepidæ, &c., suffered the\r\n      same fate. A common origin was thus attributed to tribes who had\r\n      only been united by the conquests of some dominant nation, and\r\n      this confusion has given rise to a number of historical\r\n      errors.—G. ——M. St. Martin has a learned note (to Le Beau, v.\r\n      261) on the origin of the Vandals. The difficulty appears to be\r\n      in rejecting the close analogy of the name with the Vend or\r\n      Wendish race, who were of Sclavonian, not of Suevian or German,\r\n      origin. M. St. Martin supposes that the different races spread\r\n      from the head of the Adriatic to the Baltic, and even the Veneti,\r\n      on the shores of the Adriatic, the Vindelici, the tribes which\r\n      gave their name to Vindobena, Vindoduna, Vindonissa, were\r\n      branches of the same stock with the Sclavonian Venedi, who at one\r\n      time gave their name to the Baltic; that they all spoke dialects\r\n      of the Wendish language, which still prevails in Carinthia,\r\n      Carniola, part of Bohemia, and Lusatia, and is hardly extinct in\r\n      Mecklenburgh and Pomerania. The Vandal race, once so fearfully\r\n      celebrated in the annals of mankind, has so utterly perished from\r\n      the face of the earth, that we are not aware that any vestiges of\r\n      their language can be traced, so as to throw light on the\r\n      disputed question of their German, their Sclavonian, or\r\n      independent origin. The weight of ancient authority seems against\r\n      M. St. Martin’s opinion. Compare, on the Vandals, Malte Brun.\r\n      394. Also Gibbon’s note, c. xli. n. 38.—M.]\r\n\r\n      In the age of the Antonines, the Goths were still seated in\r\n      Prussia. About the reign of Alexander Severus, the Roman province\r\n      of Dacia had already experienced their proximity by frequent and\r\n      destructive inroads. 19 In this interval, therefore, of about\r\n      seventy years we must place the second migration of the Goths\r\n      from the Baltic to the Euxine; but the cause that produced it\r\n      lies concealed among the various motives which actuate the\r\n      conduct of unsettled barbarians. Either a pestilence or a famine,\r\n      a victory or a defeat, an oracle of the gods or the eloquence of\r\n      a daring leader, were sufficient to impel the Gothic arms on the\r\n      milder climates of the south. Besides the influence of a martial\r\n      religion, the numbers and spirit of the Goths were equal to the\r\n      most dangerous adventures. The use of round bucklers and short\r\n      swords rendered them formidable in a close engagement; the manly\r\n      obedience which they yielded to hereditary kings, gave uncommon\r\n      union and stability to their councils; 20 and the renowned Amala,\r\n      the hero of that age, and the tenth ancestor of Theodoric, king\r\n      of Italy, enforced, by the ascendant of personal merit, the\r\n      prerogative of his birth, which he derived from the _Anses_, or\r\n      demigods of the Gothic nation. 21\r\n\r\n      19 (return) [ See a fragment of Peter Patricius in the Excerpta\r\n      Legationum and with regard to its probable date, see Tillemont,\r\n      Hist, des Empereurs, tom. iii. p. 346.]\r\n\r\n      20 (return) [ Omnium harum gentium insigne, rotunda scuta, breves\r\n      gladii, et erga rages obsequium.

They followed the unknown course of the river, confident\r\n      in their valor, and careless of whatever power might oppose their\r\n      progress. The Bastarnæ and the Venedi were the first who\r\n      presented themselves; and the flower of their youth, either from\r\n      choice or compulsion, increased the Gothic army. The Bastarnæ\r\n      dwelt on the northern side of the Carpathian Mountains: the\r\n      immense tract of land that separated the Bastarnæ from the\r\n      savages of Finland was possessed, or rather wasted, by the\r\n      Venedi; 24 we have some reason to believe that the first of these\r\n      nations, which distinguished itself in the Macedonian war, 25 and\r\n      was afterwards divided into the formidable tribes of the Peucini,\r\n      the Borani, the Carpi, &c., derived its origin from the Germans.\r\n      251 With better authority, a Sarmatian extraction may be assigned\r\n      to the Venedi, who rendered themselves so famous in the middle\r\n      ages. 26 But the confusion of blood and manners on that doubtful\r\n      frontier often perplexed the most accurate observers. 27 As the\r\n      Goths advanced near the Euxine Sea, they encountered a purer race\r\n      of Sarmatians, the Jazyges, the Alani, 271 and the Roxolani; and\r\n      they were probably the first Germans who saw the mouths of the\r\n      Borysthenes, and of the Tanais. If we inquire into the\r\n      characteristic marks of the people of Germany and of Sarmatia, we\r\n      shall discover that those two great portions of human kind were\r\n      principally distinguished by fixed huts or movable tents, by a\r\n      close dress or flowing garments, by the marriage of one or of\r\n      several wives, by a military force, consisting, for the most\r\n      part, either of infantry or cavalry; and above all, by the use of\r\n      the Teutonic, or of the Sclavonian language; the last of which\r\n      has been diffused by conquest, from the confines of Italy to the\r\n      neighborhood of Japan.\r\n\r\n      22 (return) [ The Heruli, and the Uregundi or Burgundi, are\r\n      particularly mentioned.

But the prospect\r\n      of the Roman territories was far more alluring; and the fields of\r\n      Dacia were covered with rich harvests, sown by the hands of an\r\n      industrious, and exposed to be gathered by those of a warlike,\r\n      people. It is probable that the conquests of Trajan, maintained\r\n      by his successors, less for any real advantage than for ideal\r\n      dignity, had contributed to weaken the empire on that side. The\r\n      new and unsettled province of Dacia was neither strong enough to\r\n      resist, nor rich enough to satiate, the rapaciousness of the\r\n      barbarians. As long as the remote banks of the Niester were\r\n      considered as the boundary of the Roman power, the fortifications\r\n      of the Lower Danube were more carelessly guarded, and the\r\n      inhabitants of Mæsia lived in supine security, fondly conceiving\r\n      themselves at an inaccessible distance from any barbarian\r\n      invaders. The irruptions of the Goths, under the reign of Philip,\r\n      fatally convinced them of their mistake. The king, or leader, of\r\n      that fierce nation, traversed with contempt the province of\r\n      Dacia, and passed both the Niester and the Danube without\r\n      encountering any opposition capable of retarding his progress.\r\n      The relaxed discipline of the Roman troops betrayed the most\r\n      important posts, where they were stationed, and the fear of\r\n      deserved punishment induced great numbers of them to enlist under\r\n      the Gothic standard. The various multitude of barbarians\r\n      appeared, at length, under the walls of Marcianopolis, a city\r\n      built by Trajan in honor of his sister, and at that time the\r\n      capital of the second Mæsia. 29 The inhabitants consented to\r\n      ransom their lives and property by the payment of a large sum of\r\n      money, and the invaders retreated back into their deserts,\r\n      animated, rather than satisfied, with the first success of their\r\n      arms against an opulent but feeble country. Intelligence was soon\r\n      transmitted to the emperor Decius, that Cniva, king of the Goths,\r\n      had passed the Danube a second time, with more considerable\r\n      forces; that his numerous detachments scattered devastation over\r\n      the province of Mæsia, whilst the main body of the army,\r\n      consisting of seventy thousand Germans and Sarmatians, a force\r\n      equal to the most daring achievements, required the presence of\r\n      the Roman monarch, and the exertion of his military power.\r\n\r\n      29 (return) [ In the sixteenth chapter of Jornandes, instead of\r\n      secundo Mæsiam we may venture to substitute secundam, the second\r\n      Mæsia, of which Marcianopolis was certainly the capital.

The camp of the Romans was\r\n      surprised and pillaged, and, for the first time, their emperor\r\n      fled in disorder before a troop of half-armed barbarians.

In carelessness\r\n      alone they are alike.]\r\n\r\n      At the same time when Decius was struggling with the violence of\r\n      the tempest, his mind, calm and deliberate amidst the tumult of\r\n      war, investigated the more general causes that, since the age of\r\n      the Antonines, had so impetuously urged the decline of the Roman\r\n      greatness. He soon discovered that it was impossible to replace\r\n      that greatness on a permanent basis without restoring public\r\n      virtue, ancient principles and manners, and the oppressed majesty\r\n      of the laws. To execute this noble but arduous design, he first\r\n      resolved to revive the obsolete office of censor; an office\r\n      which, as long as it had subsisted in its pristine integrity, had\r\n      so much contributed to the perpetuity of the state, 37 till it\r\n      was usurped and gradually neglected by the Cæsars. 38 Conscious\r\n      that the favor of the sovereign may confer power, but that the\r\n      esteem of the people can alone bestow authority, he submitted the\r\n      choice of the censor to the unbiased voice of the senate. By\r\n      their unanimous votes, or rather acclamations, Valerian, who was\r\n      afterwards emperor, and who then served with distinction in the\r\n      army of Decius, was declared the most worthy of that exalted\r\n      honor. As soon as the decree of the senate was transmitted to the\r\n      emperor, he assembled a great council in his camp, and before the\r\n      investiture of the censor elect, he apprised him of the\r\n      difficulty and importance of his great office. “Happy Valerian,”\r\n      said the prince to his distinguished subject, “happy in the\r\n      general approbation of the senate and of the Roman republic!\r\n      Accept the censorship of mankind; and judge of our manners.

He modestly argued the alarming greatness\r\n      of the trust, his own insufficiency, and the incurable corruption\r\n      of the times. He artfully insinuated, that the office of censor\r\n      was inseparable from the Imperial dignity, and that the feeble\r\n      hands of a subject were unequal to the support of such an immense\r\n      weight of cares and of power. 42 The approaching event of war\r\n      soon put an end to the prosecution of a project so specious, but\r\n      so impracticable; and whilst it preserved Valerian from the\r\n      danger, saved the emperor Decius from the disappointment, which\r\n      would most probably have attended it. A censor may maintain, he\r\n      can never restore, the morals of a state. It is impossible for\r\n      such a magistrate to exert his authority with benefit, or even\r\n      with effect, unless he is supported by a quick sense of honor and\r\n      virtue in the minds of the people, by a decent reverence for the\r\n      public opinion, and by a train of useful prejudices combating on\r\n      the side of national manners. In a period when these principles\r\n      are annihilated, the censorial jurisdiction must either sink into\r\n      empty pageantry, or be converted into a partial instrument of\r\n      vexatious oppression. 43 It was easier to vanquish the Goths than\r\n      to eradicate the public vices; yet even in the first of these\r\n      enterprises, Decius lost his army and his life.\r\n\r\n      41 (return) [ This transaction might deceive Zonaras, who\r\n      supposes that Valerian was actually declared the colleague of\r\n      Decius, l. xii. p. 625.]\r\n\r\n      42 (return) [ Hist.

The flower of their troops had perished in the long\r\n      siege of Philippopolis, and the exhausted country could no longer\r\n      afford subsistence for the remaining multitude of licentious\r\n      barbarians. Reduced to this extremity, the Goths would gladly\r\n      have purchased, by the surrender of all their booty and\r\n      prisoners, the permission of an undisturbed retreat. But the\r\n      emperor, confident of victory, and resolving, by the chastisement\r\n      of these invaders, to strike a salutary terror into the nations\r\n      of the North, refused to listen to any terms of accommodation.\r\n      The high-spirited barbarians preferred death to slavery. An\r\n      obscure town of Mæsia, called Forum Terebronii, 44 was the scene\r\n      of the battle. The Gothic army was drawn up in three lines, and\r\n      either from choice or accident, the front of the third line was\r\n      covered by a morass. In the beginning of the action, the son of\r\n      Decius, a youth of the fairest hopes, and already associated to\r\n      the honors of the purple, was slain by an arrow, in the sight of\r\n      his afflicted father; who, summoning all his fortitude,\r\n      admonished the dismayed troops, that the loss of a single soldier\r\n      was of little importance to the republic. 45 The conflict was\r\n      terrible; it was the combat of despair against grief and rage.\r\n      The first line of the Goths at length gave way in disorder; the\r\n      second, advancing to sustain it, shared its fate; and the third\r\n      only remained entire, prepared to dispute the passage of the\r\n      morass, which was imprudently attempted by the presumption of the\r\n      enemy. “Here the fortune of the day turned, and all things became\r\n      adverse to the Romans; the place deep with ooze, sinking under\r\n      those who stood, slippery to such as advanced; their armor heavy,\r\n      the waters deep; nor could they wield, in that uneasy situation,\r\n      their weighty javelins. The barbarians, on the contrary, were\r\n      inured to encounter in the bogs, their persons tall, their spears\r\n      long, such as could wound at a distance.” 46 In this morass the\r\n      Roman army, after an ineffectual struggle, was irrecoverably\r\n      lost; nor could the body of the emperor ever be found. 47 Such\r\n      was the fate of Decius, in the fiftieth year of his age; an\r\n      accomplished prince, active in war and affable in peace; 48 who,\r\n      together with his son, has deserved to be compared, both in life\r\n      and death, with the brightest examples of ancient virtue. 49\r\n\r\n      44 (return) [ Tillemont, Histoire des Empereurs, tom. iii. p.\r\n      598.

They appeared to have patiently expected, and\r\n      submissively obeyed, the decree of the senate which regulated the\r\n      succession to the throne. From a just regard for the memory of\r\n      Decius, the Imperial title was conferred on Hostilianus, his only\r\n      surviving son; but an equal rank, with more effectual power, was\r\n      granted to Gallus, whose experience and ability seemed equal to\r\n      the great trust of guardian to the young prince and the\r\n      distressed empire. 50 The first care of the new emperor was to\r\n      deliver the Illyrian provinces from the intolerable weight of the\r\n      victorious Goths. He consented to leave in their hands the rich\r\n      fruits of their invasion, an immense booty, and what was still\r\n      more disgraceful, a great number of prisoners of the highest\r\n      merit and quality. He plentifully supplied their camp with every\r\n      conveniency that could assuage their angry spirits or facilitate\r\n      their so much wished-for departure; and he even promised to pay\r\n      them annually a large sum of gold, on condition they should never\r\n      afterwards infest the Roman territories by their incursions. 51\r\n\r\n      50 (return) [ Hæc ubi Patres comperere.. .. decernunt.

They relieved the\r\n      poverty of the barbarians, honored their merit, and recompensed\r\n      their fidelity. These voluntary marks of bounty were understood\r\n      to flow, not from the fears, but merely from the generosity or\r\n      the gratitude of the Romans; and whilst presents and subsidies\r\n      were liberally distributed among friends and suppliants, they\r\n      were sternly refused to such as claimed them as a debt. 53 But\r\n      this stipulation, of an annual payment to a victorious enemy,\r\n      appeared without disguise in the light of an ignominious tribute;\r\n      the minds of the Romans were not yet accustomed to accept such\r\n      unequal laws from a tribe of barbarians; and the prince, who by a\r\n      necessary concession had probably saved his country, became the\r\n      object of the general contempt and aversion. The death of\r\n      Hostiliamus, though it happened in the midst of a raging\r\n      pestilence, was interpreted as the personal crime of Gallus; 54\r\n      and even the defeat of the later emperor was ascribed by the\r\n      voice of suspicion to the perfidious counsels of his hated\r\n      successor. 55 The tranquillity which the empire enjoyed during\r\n      the first year of his administration, 56 served rather to inflame\r\n      than to appease the public discontent; and as soon as the\r\n      apprehensions of war were removed, the infamy of the peace was\r\n      more deeply and more sensibly felt.\r\n\r\n      52 (return) [ A _Sella_, a _Toga_, and a golden _Patera_ of five\r\n      pounds weight, were accepted with joy and gratitude by the\r\n      wealthy king of Egypt.

The Gothic writer at least\r\n      observed the peace which his victorious countrymen had sworn to\r\n      Gallus.]\r\n\r\n      But the Romans were irritated to a still higher degree, when they\r\n      discovered that they had not even secured their repose, though at\r\n      the expense of their honor. The dangerous secret of the wealth\r\n      and weakness of the empire had been revealed to the world. New\r\n      swarms of barbarians, encouraged by the success, and not\r\n      conceiving themselves bound by the obligation of their brethren,\r\n      spread devastation though the Illyrian provinces, and terror as\r\n      far as the gates of Rome. The defence of the monarchy, which\r\n      seemed abandoned by the pusillanimous emperor, was assumed by\r\n      Æmilianus, governor of Pannonia and Mæsia; who rallied the\r\n      scattered forces, and revived the fainting spirits of the troops.\r\n      The barbarians were unexpectedly attacked, routed, chased, and\r\n      pursued beyond the Danube. The victorious leader distributed as a\r\n      donative the money collected for the tribute, and the\r\n      acclamations of the soldiers proclaimed him emperor on the field\r\n      of battle. 57 Gallus, who, careless of the general welfare,\r\n      indulged himself in the pleasures of Italy, was almost in the\r\n      same instant informed of the success, of the revolt, and of the\r\n      rapid approach of his aspiring lieutenant. He advanced to meet\r\n      him as far as the plains of Spoleto. When the armies came in\r\n      sight of each other, the soldiers of Gallus compared the\r\n      ignominious conduct of their sovereign with the glory of his\r\n      rival. They admired the valor of Æmilianus; they were attracted\r\n      by his liberality, for he offered a considerable increase of pay\r\n      to all deserters. 58 The murder of Gallus, and of his son\r\n      Volusianus, put an end to the civil war; and the senate gave a\r\n      legal sanction to the rights of conquest. The letters of\r\n      Æmilianus to that assembly displayed a mixture of moderation and\r\n      vanity. He assured them, that he should resign to their wisdom\r\n      the civil administration; and, contenting himself with the\r\n      quality of their general, would in a short time assert the glory\r\n      of Rome, and deliver the empire from all the barbarians both of\r\n      the North and of the East. 59 His pride was flattered by the\r\n      applause of the senate; and medals are still extant, representing\r\n      him with the name and attributes of Hercules the Victor, and Mars\r\n      the Avenger. 60\r\n\r\n      57 (return) [ Zosimus, l. i. p. 25, 26.]\r\n\r\n      58 (return) [ Victor in Cæsaribus.]\r\n\r\n      59 (return) [ Zonaras, l. xii. p. 628.]\r\n\r\n      60 (return) [ Banduri Numismata, p. 94.]\r\n\r\n      If the new monarch possessed the abilities, he wanted the time,\r\n      necessary to fulfil these splendid promises. Less than four\r\n      months intervened between his victory and his fall. 61 He had\r\n      vanquished Gallus: he sunk under the weight of a competitor more\r\n      formidable than Gallus. That unfortunate prince had sent\r\n      Valerian, already distinguished by the honorable title of censor,\r\n      to bring the legions of Gaul and Germany 62 to his aid. Valerian\r\n      executed that commission with zeal and fidelity; and as he\r\n      arrived too late to save his sovereign, he resolved to revenge\r\n      him. The troops of Æmilianus, who still lay encamped in the\r\n      plains of Spoleto, were awed by the sanctity of his character,\r\n      but much more by the superior strength of his army; and as they\r\n      were now become as incapable of personal attachment as they had\r\n      always been of constitutional principle, they readily imbrued\r\n      their hands in the blood of a prince who so lately had been the\r\n      object of their partial choice. The guilt was theirs, 621 but the\r\n      advantage of it was Valerian’s; who obtained the possession of\r\n      the throne by the means indeed of a civil war, but with a degree\r\n      of innocence singular in that age of revolutions; since he owed\r\n      neither gratitude nor allegiance to his predecessor, whom he\r\n      dethroned.\r\n\r\n      61 (return) [ Eutropius, l. ix. c. 6, says tertio mense.

Tropius, in speaking of his death, does not say\r\n      that he was assassinated—G.]\r\n\r\n      Valerian was about sixty years of age 63 when he was invested\r\n      with the purple, not by the caprice of the populace, or the\r\n      clamors of the army, but by the unanimous voice of the Roman\r\n      world. In his gradual ascent through the honors of the state, he\r\n      had deserved the favor of virtuous princes, and had declared\r\n      himself the enemy of tyrants. 64 His noble birth, his mild but\r\n      unblemished manners, his learning, prudence, and experience, were\r\n      revered by the senate and people; and if mankind (according to\r\n      the observation of an ancient writer) had been left at liberty to\r\n      choose a master, their choice would most assuredly have fallen on\r\n      Valerian. 65 Perhaps the merit of this emperor was inadequate to\r\n      his reputation; perhaps his abilities, or at least his spirit,\r\n      were affected by the languor and coldness of old age. The\r\n      consciousness of his decline engaged him to share the throne with\r\n      a younger and more active associate; 66 the emergency of the\r\n      times demanded a general no less than a prince; and the\r\n      experience of the Roman censor might have directed him where to\r\n      bestow the Imperial purple, as the reward of military merit. But\r\n      instead of making a judicious choice, which would have confirmed\r\n      his reign and endeared his memory, Valerian, consulting only the\r\n      dictates of affection or vanity, immediately invested with the\r\n      supreme honors his son Gallienus, a youth whose effeminate vices\r\n      had been hitherto concealed by the obscurity of a private\r\n      station. The joint government of the father and the son subsisted\r\n      about seven, and the sole administration of Gallienus continued\r\n      about eight, years. But the whole period was one uninterrupted\r\n      series of confusion and calamity.

It has been supposed that Pannonia, 67 that\r\n      Gaul, that the northern parts of Germany, 68 gave birth to that\r\n      celebrated colony of warriors. At length the most rational\r\n      critics, rejecting the fictitious emigrations of ideal\r\n      conquerors, have acquiesced in a sentiment whose simplicity\r\n      persuades us of its truth. 69 They suppose, that about the year\r\n      two hundred and forty, 70 a new confederacy was formed under the\r\n      name of Franks, by the old inhabitants of the Lower Rhine and the\r\n      Weser. 701 The present circle of Westphalia, the Landgraviate of\r\n      Hesse, and the duchies of Brunswick and Luneburg, were the\r\n      ancient seat of the Chauci who, in their inaccessible morasses,\r\n      defied the Roman arms; 71 of the Cherusci, proud of the fame of\r\n      Arminius; of the Catti, formidable by their firm and intrepid\r\n      infantry; and of several other tribes of inferior power and\r\n      renown. 72 The love of liberty was the ruling passion of these\r\n      Germans; the enjoyment of it their best treasure; the word that\r\n      expressed that enjoyment the most pleasing to their ear. They\r\n      deserved, they assumed, they maintained the honorable epithet of\r\n      Franks, or Freemen; which concealed, though it did not\r\n      extinguish, the peculiar names of the several states of the\r\n      confederacy. 73 Tacit consent, and mutual advantage, dictated the\r\n      first laws of the union; it was gradually cemented by habit and\r\n      experience. The league of the Franks may admit of some comparison\r\n      with the Helvetic body; in which every canton, retaining its\r\n      independent sovereignty, consults with its brethren in the common\r\n      cause, without acknowledging the authority of any supreme head or\r\n      representative assembly. 74 But the principle of the two\r\n      confederacies was extremely different. A peace of two hundred\r\n      years has rewarded the wise and honest policy of the Swiss. An\r\n      inconstant spirit, the thirst of rapine, and a disregard to the\r\n      most solemn treaties, disgraced the character of the Franks.\r\n\r\n      67 (return) [ Various systems have been formed to explain a\r\n      difficult passage in Gregory of Tours, l. ii. c. 9.]\r\n\r\n      68 (return) [ The Geographer of Ravenna, i. 11, by mentioning\r\n      Mauringania, on the confines of Denmark, as the ancient seat of\r\n      the Franks, gave birth to an ingenious system of Leibritz.]\r\n\r\n      69 (return) [ See Cluver.

In that part of Upper Saxony, beyond the Elbe, which is at\r\n      present called the Marquisate of Lusace, there existed, in\r\n      ancient times, a sacred wood, the awful seat of the superstition\r\n      of the Suevi. None were permitted to enter the holy precincts,\r\n      without confessing, by their servile bonds and suppliant posture,\r\n      the immediate presence of the sovereign Deity. 81 Patriotism\r\n      contributed, as well as devotion, to consecrate the Sonnenwald,\r\n      or wood of the Semnones. 82 It was universally believed, that the\r\n      nation had received its first existence on that sacred spot. At\r\n      stated periods, the numerous tribes who gloried in the Suevic\r\n      blood, resorted thither by their ambassadors; and the memory of\r\n      their common extraction was perpetrated by barbaric rites and\r\n      human sacrifices. The wide-extended name of Suevi filled the\r\n      interior countries of Germany, from the banks of the Oder to\r\n      those of the Danube. They were distinguished from the other\r\n      Germans by their peculiar mode of dressing their long hair, which\r\n      they gathered into a rude knot on the crown of the head; and they\r\n      delighted in an ornament that showed their ranks more lofty and\r\n      terrible in the eyes of the enemy. 83 Jealous as the Germans were\r\n      of military renown, they all confessed the superior valor of the\r\n      Suevi; and the tribes of the Usipetes and Tencteri, who, with a\r\n      vast army, encountered the dictator Cæsar, declared that they\r\n      esteemed it not a disgrace to have fled before a people to whose\r\n      arms the immortal gods themselves were unequal. 84\r\n\r\n      81 (return) [ Tacit.Germania, 38.]\r\n\r\n      82 (return) [ Cluver.

The Alemanni fought chiefly on horseback; but\r\n      their cavalry was rendered still more formidable by a mixture of\r\n      light infantry, selected from the bravest and most active of the\r\n      youth, whom frequent exercise had inured to accompany the\r\n      horsemen in the longest march, the most rapid charge, or the most\r\n      precipitate retreat. 87\r\n\r\n      85 (return) [ Victor in Caracal.

Three hundred thousand are said to have been vanquished,\r\n      in a battle near Milan, by Gallienus in person, at the head of\r\n      only ten thousand Romans. 91 We may, however, with great\r\n      probability, ascribe this incredible victory either to the\r\n      credulity of the historian, or to some exaggerated exploits of\r\n      one of the emperor’s lieutenants. It was by arms of a very\r\n      different nature, that Gallienus endeavored to protect Italy from\r\n      the fury of the Germans. He espoused Pipa, the daughter of a king\r\n      of the Marcomanni, a Suevic tribe, which was often confounded\r\n      with the Alemanni in their wars and conquests. 92 To the father,\r\n      as the price of his alliance, he granted an ample settlement in\r\n      Pannonia. The native charms of unpolished beauty seem to have\r\n      fixed the daughter in the affections of the inconstant emperor,\r\n      and the bands of policy were more firmly connected by those of\r\n      love. But the haughty prejudice of Rome still refused the name of\r\n      marriage to the profane mixture of a citizen and a barbarian; and\r\n      has stigmatized the German princess with the opprobrious title of\r\n      concubine of Gallienus. 93\r\n\r\n      91 (return) [ Zonaras, l. xii. p. 631.]\r\n\r\n      92 (return) [ One of the Victors calls him king of the\r\n      Marcomanni; the other of the Germans.]\r\n\r\n      93 (return) [ See Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iii. p.\r\n      398, &c.]\r\n\r\n      III. We have already traced the emigration of the Goths from\r\n      Scandinavia, or at least from Prussia, to the mouth of the\r\n      Borysthenes, and have followed their victorious arms from the\r\n      Borysthenes to the Danube. Under the reigns of Valerian and\r\n      Gallienus, the frontier of the last-mentioned river was\r\n      perpetually infested by the inroads of Germans and Sarmatians;\r\n      but it was defended by the Romans with more than usual firmness\r\n      and success. The provinces that were the seat of war, recruited\r\n      the armies of Rome with an inexhaustible supply of hardy\r\n      soldiers; and more than one of these Illyrian peasants attained\r\n      the station, and displayed the abilities, of a general. Though\r\n      flying parties of the barbarians, who incessantly hovered on the\r\n      banks of the Danube, penetrated sometimes to the confines of\r\n      Italy and Macedonia, their progress was commonly checked, or\r\n      their return intercepted, by the Imperial lieutenants. 94 But the\r\n      great stream of the Gothic hostilities was diverted into a very\r\n      different channel. The Goths, in their new settlement of the\r\n      Ukraine, soon became masters of the northern coast of the Euxine:\r\n      to the south of that inland sea were situated the soft and\r\n      wealthy provinces of Asia Minor, which possessed all that could\r\n      attract, and nothing that could resist, a barbarian conqueror.\r\n\r\n      94 (return) [ See the lives of Claudius, Aurelian, and Probus, in\r\n      the Augustan History.]\r\n\r\n      The banks of the Borysthenes are only sixty miles distant from\r\n      the narrow entrance 95 of the peninsula of Crim Tartary, known to\r\n      the ancients under the name of Chersonesus Taurica. 96 On that\r\n      inhospitable shore, Euripides, embellishing with exquisite art\r\n      the tales of antiquity, has placed the scene of one of his most\r\n      affecting tragedies. 97 The bloody sacrifices of Diana, the\r\n      arrival of Orestes and Pylades, and the triumph of virtue and\r\n      religion over savage fierceness, serve to represent an historical\r\n      truth, that the Tauri, the original inhabitants of the peninsula,\r\n      were, in some degree, reclaimed from their brutal manners by a\r\n      gradual intercourse with the Grecian colonies, which settled\r\n      along the maritime coast. The little kingdom of Bosphorus, whose\r\n      capital was situated on the Straits, through which the Mæotis\r\n      communicates itself to the Euxine, was composed of degenerate\r\n      Greeks and half-civilized barbarians. It subsisted, as an\r\n      independent state, from the time of the Peloponnesian war, 98 was\r\n      at last swallowed up by the ambition of Mithridates, 99 and, with\r\n      the rest of his dominions, sunk under the weight of the Roman\r\n      arms. From the reign of Augustus, 100 the kings of Bosphorus were\r\n      the humble, but not useless, allies of the empire. By presents,\r\n      by arms, and by a slight fortification drawn across the Isthmus,\r\n      they effectually guarded, against the roving plunderers of\r\n      Sarmatia, the access of a country which, from its peculiar\r\n      situation and convenient harbors, commanded the Euxine Sea and\r\n      Asia Minor. 101 As long as the sceptre was possessed by a lineal\r\n      succession of kings, they acquitted themselves of their important\r\n      charge with vigilance and success. Domestic factions, and the\r\n      fears, or private interest, of obscure usurpers, who seized on\r\n      the vacant throne, admitted the Goths into the heart of\r\n      Bosphorus. With the acquisition of a superfluous waste of fertile\r\n      soil, the conquerors obtained the command of a naval force,\r\n      sufficient to transport their armies to the coast of Asia. 102\r\n      These ships used in the navigation of the Euxine were of a very\r\n      singular construction. They were slight flat-bottomed barks\r\n      framed of timber only, without the least mixture of iron, and\r\n      occasionally covered with a shelving roof, on the appearance of a\r\n      tempest. 103 In these floating houses, the Goths carelessly\r\n      trusted themselves to the mercy of an unknown sea, under the\r\n      conduct of sailors pressed into the service, and whose skill and\r\n      fidelity were equally suspicious. But the hopes of plunder had\r\n      banished every idea of danger, and a natural fearlessness of\r\n      temper supplied in their minds the more rational confidence,\r\n      which is the just result of knowledge and experience. Warriors of\r\n      such a daring spirit must have often murmured against the\r\n      cowardice of their guides, who required the strongest assurances\r\n      of a settled calm before they would venture to embark; and would\r\n      scarcely ever be tempted to lose sight of the land.

Trebizond, celebrated in\r\n      the retreat of the ten thousand as an ancient colony of Greeks,\r\n      108 derived its wealth and splendor from the magnificence of the\r\n      emperor Hadrian, who had constructed an artificial port on a\r\n      coast left destitute by nature of secure harbors. 109 The city\r\n      was large and populous; a double enclosure of walls seemed to\r\n      defy the fury of the Goths, and the usual garrison had been\r\n      strengthened by a reënforcement of ten thousand men. But there\r\n      are not any advantages capable of supplying the absence of\r\n      discipline and vigilance. The numerous garrison of Trebizond,\r\n      dissolved in riot and luxury, disdained to guard their\r\n      impregnable fortifications. The Goths soon discovered the supine\r\n      negligence of the besieged, erected a lofty pile of fascines,\r\n      ascended the walls in the silence of the night, and entered the\r\n      defenceless city sword in hand.

The\r\n      booty that fell into the hands of the Goths was immense: the\r\n      wealth of the adjacent countries had been deposited in Trebizond,\r\n      as in a secure place of refuge. The number of captives was\r\n      incredible, as the victorious barbarians ranged without\r\n      opposition through the extensive province of Pontus. 110 The rich\r\n      spoils of Trebizond filled a great fleet of ships that had been\r\n      found in the port. The robust youth of the sea-coast were chained\r\n      to the oar; and the Goths, satisfied with the success of their\r\n      first naval expedition, returned in triumph to their new\r\n      establishment in the kingdom of Bosphorus. 111\r\n\r\n      107 (return) [ Arrian (in Periplo Maris Euxine, p. 130) calls the\r\n      distance 2610 stadia.]\r\n\r\n      108 (return) [ Xenophon, Anabasis, l. iv. p. 348, edit.\r\n      Hutchinson.

The garrison of Chalcedon was encamped near the\r\n      temple of Jupiter Urius, on a promontory that commanded the\r\n      entrance of the Strait; and so inconsiderable were the dreaded\r\n      invasions of the barbarians that this body of troops surpassed in\r\n      number the Gothic army. But it was in numbers alone that they\r\n      surpassed it. They deserted with precipitation their advantageous\r\n      post, and abandoned the town of Chalcedon, most plentifully\r\n      stored with arms and money, to the discretion of the conquerors.\r\n      Whilst they hesitated whether they should prefer the sea or land,\r\n      Europe or Asia, for the scene of their hostilities, a perfidious\r\n      fugitive pointed out Nicomedia, 1111 once the capital of the\r\n      kings of Bithynia, as a rich and easy conquest. He guided the\r\n      march, which was only sixty miles from the camp of Chalcedon, 112\r\n      directed the resistless attack, and partook of the booty; for the\r\n      Goths had learned sufficient policy to reward the traitor whom\r\n      they detested. Nice, Prusa, Apamæa, Cius, 1121 cities that had\r\n      sometimes rivalled, or imitated, the splendor of Nicomedia, were\r\n      involved in the same calamity, which, in a few weeks, raged\r\n      without control through the whole province of Bithynia. Three\r\n      hundred years of peace, enjoyed by the soft inhabitants of Asia,\r\n      had abolished the exercise of arms, and removed the apprehension\r\n      of danger. The ancient walls were suffered to moulder away, and\r\n      all the revenue of the most opulent cities was reserved for the\r\n      construction of baths, temples, and theatres. 113\r\n\r\n      1111 (return) [ It has preserved its name, joined to the\r\n      preposition of place in that of Nikmid.

From the recent sack\r\n      of Prusa, the Goths advanced within eighteen miles 116 of the\r\n      city, which they had devoted to destruction; but the ruin of\r\n      Cyzicus was delayed by a fortunate accident. The season was\r\n      rainy, and the Lake Apolloniates, the reservoir of all the\r\n      springs of Mount Olympus, rose to an uncommon height. The little\r\n      river of Rhyndacus, which issues from the lake, swelled into a\r\n      broad and rapid stream, and stopped the progress of the Goths.\r\n      Their retreat to the maritime city of Heraclea, where the fleet\r\n      had probably been stationed, was attended by a long train of\r\n      wagons, laden with the spoils of Bithynia, and was marked by the\r\n      flames of Nico and Nicomedia, which they wantonly burnt. 117 Some\r\n      obscure hints are mentioned of a doubtful combat that secured\r\n      their retreat. 118 But even a complete victory would have been of\r\n      little moment, as the approach of the autumnal equinox summoned\r\n      them to hasten their return.

Impatient of the limits of the Euxine,\r\n      they steered their destructive course from the Cimmerian to the\r\n      Thracian Bosphorus. When they had almost gained the middle of the\r\n      Straits, they were suddenly driven back to the entrance of them;\r\n      till a favorable wind, springing up the next day, carried them in\r\n      a few hours into the placid sea, or rather lake, of the\r\n      Propontis. Their landing on the little island of Cyzicus was\r\n      attended with the ruin of that ancient and noble city. From\r\n      thence issuing again through the narrow passage of the\r\n      Hellespont, they pursued their winding navigation amidst the\r\n      numerous islands scattered over the Archipelago, or the Ægean\r\n      Sea. The assistance of captives and deserters must have been very\r\n      necessary to pilot their vessels, and to direct their various\r\n      incursions, as well on the coast of Greece as on that of Asia. At\r\n      length the Gothic fleet anchored in the port of Piræus, five\r\n      miles distant from Athens, 122 which had attempted to make some\r\n      preparations for a vigorous defence. Cleodamus, one of the\r\n      engineers employed by the emperor’s orders to fortify the\r\n      maritime cities against the Goths, had already begun to repair\r\n      the ancient walls, fallen to decay since the time of Scylla. The\r\n      efforts of his skill were ineffectual, and the barbarians became\r\n      masters of the native seat of the muses and the arts. But while\r\n      the conquerors abandoned themselves to the license of plunder and\r\n      intemperance, their fleet, that lay with a slender guard in the\r\n      harbor of Piræus, was unexpectedly attacked by the brave\r\n      Dexippus, who, flying with the engineer Cleodamus from the sack\r\n      of Athens, collected a hasty band of volunteers, peasants as well\r\n      as soldiers, and in some measure avenged the calamities of his\r\n      country. 123\r\n\r\n      120 (return) [ Syncellus (p. 382) speaks of this expedition, as\r\n      undertaken by the Heruli.]\r\n\r\n      121 (return) [ Strabo, l. xi. p. 495.]\r\n\r\n      122 (return) [ Plin.

It is not without some attention, that we can explain and\r\n      conciliate their imperfect hints. We can still discover some\r\n      traces of the partiality of Dexippus, in the relation of his own\r\n      and his countrymen’s exploits. * Note: According to a new\r\n      fragment of Dexippus, published by Mai, the 2000 men took up a\r\n      strong position in a mountainous and woods district, and kept up\r\n      a harassing warfare.

A general\r\n      conflagration blazed out at the same time in every district of\r\n      Greece. Thebes and Argos, Corinth and Sparta, which had formerly\r\n      waged such memorable wars against each other, were now unable to\r\n      bring an army into the field, or even to defend their ruined\r\n      fortifications. The rage of war, both by land and by sea, spread\r\n      from the eastern point of Sunium to the western coast of Epirus.\r\n      The Goths had already advanced within sight of Italy, when the\r\n      approach of such imminent danger awakened the indolent Gallienus\r\n      from his dream of pleasure. The emperor appeared in arms; and his\r\n      presence seems to have checked the ardor, and to have divided the\r\n      strength, of the enemy. Naulobatus, a chief of the Heruli,\r\n      accepted an honorable capitulation, entered with a large body of\r\n      his countrymen into the service of Rome, and was invested with\r\n      the ornaments of the consular dignity, which had never before\r\n      been profaned by the hands of a barbarian. 124 Great numbers of\r\n      the Goths, disgusted with the perils and hardships of a tedious\r\n      voyage, broke into Mæsia, with a design of forcing their way over\r\n      the Danube to their settlements in the Ukraine. The wild attempt\r\n      would have proved inevitable destruction, if the discord of the\r\n      Roman generals had not opened to the barbarians the means of an\r\n      escape. 125 The small remainder of this destroying host returned\r\n      on board their vessels; and measuring back their way through the\r\n      Hellespont and the Bosphorus, ravaged in their passage the shores\r\n      of Troy, whose fame, immortalized by Homer, will probably survive\r\n      the memory of the Gothic conquests. As soon as they found\r\n      themselves in safety within the basin of the Euxine, they landed\r\n      at Anchialus in Thrace, near the foot of Mount Hæmus; and, after\r\n      all their toils, indulged themselves in the use of those pleasant\r\n      and salutary hot baths. What remained of the voyage was a short\r\n      and easy navigation. 126 Such was the various fate of this third\r\n      and greatest of their naval enterprises. It may seem difficult to\r\n      conceive how the original body of fifteen thousand warriors could\r\n      sustain the losses and divisions of so bold an adventure. But as\r\n      their numbers were gradually wasted by the sword, by shipwrecks,\r\n      and by the influence of a warm climate, they were perpetually\r\n      renewed by troops of banditti and deserters, who flocked to the\r\n      standard of plunder, and by a crowd of fugitive slaves, often of\r\n      German or Sarmatian extraction, who eagerly seized the glorious\r\n      opportunity of freedom and revenge. In these expeditions, the\r\n      Gothic nation claimed a superior share of honor and danger; but\r\n      the tribes that fought under the Gothic banners are sometimes\r\n      distinguished and sometimes confounded in the imperfect histories\r\n      of that age; and as the barbarian fleets seemed to issue from the\r\n      mouth of the Tanais, the vague but familiar appellation of\r\n      Scythians was frequently bestowed on the mixed multitude. 127\r\n\r\n      124 (return) [Syncellus, p. 382.

Yet we cannot forget that\r\n      the temple of Diana at Ephesus, after having risen with\r\n      increasing splendor from seven repeated misfortunes, 128 was\r\n      finally burnt by the Goths in their third naval invasion. The\r\n      arts of Greece, and the wealth of Asia, had conspired to erect\r\n      that sacred and magnificent structure. It was supported by a\r\n      hundred and twenty-seven marble columns of the Ionic order. They\r\n      were the gifts of devout monarchs, and each was sixty feet high.\r\n      The altar was adorned with the masterly sculptures of Praxiteles,\r\n      who had, perhaps, selected from the favorite legends of the place\r\n      the birth of the divine children of Latona, the concealment of\r\n      Apollo after the slaughter of the Cyclops, and the clemency of\r\n      Bacchus to the vanquished Amazons. 129 Yet the length of the\r\n      temple of Ephesus was only four hundred and twenty-five feet,\r\n      about two thirds of the measure of the church of St. Peter’s at\r\n      Rome. 130 In the other dimensions, it was still more inferior to\r\n      that sublime production of modern architecture. The spreading\r\n      arms of a Christian cross require a much greater breadth than the\r\n      oblong temples of the Pagans; and the boldest artists of\r\n      antiquity would have been startled at the proposal of raising in\r\n      the air a dome of the size and proportions of the Pantheon. The\r\n      temple of Diana was, however, admired as one of the wonders of\r\n      the world. Successive empires, the Persian, the Macedonian, and\r\n      the Roman, had revered its sanctity and enriched its splendor.\r\n      131 But the rude savages of the Baltic were destitute of a taste\r\n      for the elegant arts, and they despised the ideal terrors of a\r\n      foreign superstition. 132\r\n\r\n      128 (return) [ Hist.

Chosroes, king\r\n      of Armenia, had alone preserved both his life and his\r\n      independence. He defended himself by the natural strength of his\r\n      country; by the perpetual resort of fugitives and malecontents;\r\n      by the alliance of the Romans, and above all, by his own courage.\r\n\r\n      Invincible in arms, during a thirty years’ war, he was at length\r\n      assassinated by the emissaries of Sapor, king of Persia. The\r\n      patriotic satraps of Armenia, who asserted the freedom and\r\n      dignity of the crown, implored the protection of Rome in favor of\r\n      Tiridates, the lawful heir. But the son of Chosroes was an\r\n      infant, the allies were at a distance, and the Persian monarch\r\n      advanced towards the frontier at the head of an irresistible\r\n      force. Young Tiridates, the future hope of his country, was saved\r\n      by the fidelity of a servant, and Armenia continued above\r\n      twenty-seven years a reluctant province of the great monarchy of\r\n      Persia. 134 Elated with this easy conquest, and presuming on the\r\n      distresses or the degeneracy of the Romans, Sapor obliged the\r\n      strong garrisons of Carrhæ and Nisibis 1341 to surrender, and\r\n      spread devastation and terror on either side of the Euphrates.\r\n\r\n      134 (return) [ Moses Chorenensis, l. ii. c. 71, 73, 74.

Malcolm’s Persia, l. 76.—M]\r\n\r\n      The loss of an important frontier, the ruin of a faithful and\r\n      natural ally, and the rapid success of Sapor’s ambition, affected\r\n      Rome with a deep sense of the insult as well as of the danger.\r\n      Valerian flattered himself, that the vigilance of his lieutenants\r\n      would sufficiently provide for the safety of the Rhine and of the\r\n      Danube; but he resolved, notwithstanding his advanced age, to\r\n      march in person to the defence of the Euphrates.\r\n\r\n      During his progress through Asia Minor, the naval enterprises of\r\n      the Goths were suspended, and the afflicted province enjoyed a\r\n      transient and fallacious calm. He passed the Euphrates,\r\n      encountered the Persian monarch near the walls of Edessa, was\r\n      vanquished, and taken prisoner by Sapor. The particulars of this\r\n      great event are darkly and imperfectly represented; yet, by the\r\n      glimmering light which is afforded us, we may discover a long\r\n      series of imprudence, of error, and of deserved misfortunes on\r\n      the side of the Roman emperor. He reposed an implicit confidence\r\n      in Macrianus, his Prætorian præfect. 135 That worthless minister\r\n      rendered his master formidable only to the oppressed subjects,\r\n      and contemptible to the enemies of Rome. 136 By his weak or\r\n      wicked counsels, the Imperial army was betrayed into a situation\r\n      where valor and military skill were equally unavailing. 137 The\r\n      vigorous attempt of the Romans to cut their way through the\r\n      Persian host was repulsed with great slaughter; 138 and Sapor,\r\n      who encompassed the camp with superior numbers, patiently waited\r\n      till the increasing rage of famine and pestilence had insured his\r\n      victory. The licentious murmurs of the legions soon accused\r\n      Valerian as the cause of their calamities; their seditious\r\n      clamors demanded an instant capitulation. An immense sum of gold\r\n      was offered to purchase the permission of a disgraceful retreat.\r\n      But the Persian, conscious of his superiority, refused the money\r\n      with disdain; and detaining the deputies, advanced in order of\r\n      battle to the foot of the Roman rampart, and insisted on a\r\n      personal conference with the emperor. Valerian was reduced to the\r\n      necessity of intrusting his life and dignity to the faith of an\r\n      enemy. The interview ended as it was natural to expect. The\r\n      emperor was made a prisoner, and his astonished troops laid down\r\n      their arms. 139 In such a moment of triumph, the pride and policy\r\n      of Sapor prompted him to fill the vacant throne with a successor\r\n      entirely dependent on his pleasure. Cyriades, an obscure fugitive\r\n      of Antioch, stained with every vice, was chosen to dishonor the\r\n      Roman purple; and the will of the Persian victor could not fail\r\n      of being ratified by the acclamations, however reluctant, of the\r\n      captive army. 140\r\n\r\n      135 (return) [ Hist.

He conducted Sapor over\r\n      the Euphrates, and, by the way of Chalcis, to the metropolis of\r\n      the East. So rapid were the motions of the Persian cavalry, that,\r\n      if we may credit a very judicious historian, 141 the city of\r\n      Antioch was surprised when the idle multitude was fondly gazing\r\n      on the amusements of the theatre. The splendid buildings of\r\n      Antioch, private as well as public, were either pillaged or\r\n      destroyed; and the numerous inhabitants were put to the sword, or\r\n      led away into captivity. 142 The tide of devastation was stopped\r\n      for a moment by the resolution of the high priest of Emesa.\r\n      Arrayed in his sacerdotal robes, he appeared at the head of a\r\n      great body of fanatic peasants, armed only with slings, and\r\n      defended his god and his property from the sacrilegious hands of\r\n      the followers of Zoroaster. 143 But the ruin of Tarsus, and of\r\n      many other cities, furnishes a melancholy proof that, except in\r\n      this singular instance, the conquest of Syria and Cilicia\r\n      scarcely interrupted the progress of the Persian arms. The\r\n      advantages of the narrow passes of Mount Taurus were abandoned,\r\n      in which an invader, whose principal force consisted in his\r\n      cavalry, would have been engaged in a very unequal combat: and\r\n      Sapor was permitted to form the siege of Cæsarea, the capital of\r\n      Cappadocia; a city, though of the second rank, which was supposed\r\n      to contain four hundred thousand inhabitants. Demosthenes\r\n      commanded in the place, not so much by the commission of the\r\n      emperor, as in the voluntary defence of his country. For a long\r\n      time he deferred its fate; and when at last Cæsarea was betrayed\r\n      by the perfidy of a physician, he cut his way through the\r\n      Persians, who had been ordered to exert their utmost diligence to\r\n      take him alive. This heroic chief escaped the power of a foe who\r\n      might either have honored or punished his obstinate valor; but\r\n      many thousands of his fellow-citizens were involved in a general\r\n      massacre, and Sapor is accused of treating his prisoners with\r\n      wanton and unrelenting cruelty. 144 Much should undoubtedly be\r\n      allowed for national animosity, much for humbled pride and\r\n      impotent revenge; yet, upon the whole, it is certain, that the\r\n      same prince, who, in Armenia, had displayed the mild aspect of a\r\n      legislator, showed himself to the Romans under the stern features\r\n      of a conqueror. He despaired of making any permanent\r\n      establishment in the empire, and sought only to leave behind him\r\n      a wasted desert, whilst he transported into Persia the people and\r\n      the treasures of the provinces. 145\r\n\r\n      141 (return) [ The sack of Antioch, anticipated by some\r\n      historians, is assigned, by the decisive testimony of Ammianus\r\n      Marcellinus, to the reign of Gallienus, xxiii. 5. * Note: Heyne,\r\n      in his note on Zosimus, contests this opinion of Gibbon and\r\n      observes, that the testimony of Ammianus is in fact by no means\r\n      clear, decisive.

The rich offering was accompanied with an epistle,\r\n      respectful, but not servile, from Odenathus, one of the noblest\r\n      and most opulent senators of Palmyra. “Who is this Odenathus,”\r\n      (said the haughty victor, and he commanded that the present\r\n      should be cast into the Euphrates,) “that he thus insolently\r\n      presumes to write to his lord?

He met Sapor; but he met him in arms.\r\n\r\n      Infusing his own spirit into a little army collected from the\r\n      villages of Syria 147 and the tents of the desert, 148 he hovered\r\n      round the Persian host, harassed their retreat, carried off part\r\n      of the treasure, and, what was dearer than any treasure, several\r\n      of the women of the great king; who was at last obliged to repass\r\n      the Euphrates with some marks of haste and confusion. 149 By this\r\n      exploit, Odenathus laid the foundations of his future fame and\r\n      fortunes.

Notwithstanding all the remonstrances of\r\n      his allies, who repeatedly advised him to remember the\r\n      vicissitudes of fortune, to dread the returning power of Rome,\r\n      and to make his illustrious captive the pledge of peace, not the\r\n      object of insult, Sapor still remained inflexible. When Valerian\r\n      sunk under the weight of shame and grief, his skin, stuffed with\r\n      straw, and formed into the likeness of a human figure, was\r\n      preserved for ages in the most celebrated temple of Persia; a\r\n      more real monument of triumph, than the fancied trophies of brass\r\n      and marble so often erected by Roman vanity. 150 The tale is\r\n      moral and pathetic, but the truth 1501 of it may very fairly be\r\n      called in question. The letters still extant from the princes of\r\n      the East to Sapor are manifest forgeries; 151 nor is it natural\r\n      to suppose that a jealous monarch should, even in the person of a\r\n      rival, thus publicly degrade the majesty of kings. Whatever\r\n      treatment the unfortunate Valerian might experience in Persia, it\r\n      is at least certain that the only emperor of Rome who had ever\r\n      fallen into the hands of the enemy, languished away his life in\r\n      hopeless captivity.\r\n\r\n      150 (return) [ The Pagan writers lament, the Christian insult,\r\n      the misfortunes of Valerian.

When the great emergencies of the state\r\n      required his presence and attention, he was engaged in\r\n      conversation with the philosopher Plotinus, 154 wasting his time\r\n      in trifling or licentious pleasures, preparing his initiation to\r\n      the Grecian mysteries, or soliciting a place in the Areopagus of\r\n      Athens. His profuse magnificence insulted the general poverty;\r\n      the solemn ridicule of his triumphs impressed a deeper sense of\r\n      the public disgrace. 155 The repeated intelligence of invasions,\r\n      defeats, and rebellions, he received with a careless smile; and\r\n      singling out, with affected contempt, some particular production\r\n      of the lost province, he carelessly asked, whether Rome must be\r\n      ruined, unless it was supplied with linen from Egypt, and arras\r\n      cloth from Gaul. There were, however, a few short moments in the\r\n      life of Gallienus, when, exasperated by some recent injury, he\r\n      suddenly appeared the intrepid soldier and the cruel tyrant;\r\n      till, satiated with blood, or fatigued by resistance, he\r\n      insensibly sunk into the natural mildness and indolence of his\r\n      character. 156\r\n\r\n      152 (return) [ See his life in the Augustan History.]\r\n\r\n      153 (return) [ There is still extant a very pretty Epithalamium,\r\n      composed by Gallienus for the nuptials of his nephews:—“Ite ait,\r\n      O juvenes, pariter sudate medullis Omnibus, inter vos: non\r\n      murmura vestra columbæ, Brachia non hederæ, non vincant oscula\r\n      conchæ.”]\r\n\r\n      154 (return) [ He was on the point of giving Plotinus a ruined\r\n      city of Campania to try the experiment of realizing Plato’s\r\n      Republic.

The generals, who assumed the title of Augustus, were\r\n      either respected by their troops for their able conduct and\r\n      severe discipline, or admired for valor and success in war, or\r\n      beloved for frankness and generosity. The field of victory was\r\n      often the scene of their election; and even the armorer Marius,\r\n      the most contemptible of all the candidates for the purple, was\r\n      distinguished, however, by intrepid courage, matchless strength,\r\n      and blunt honesty. 160 His mean and recent trade cast, indeed, an\r\n      air of ridicule on his elevation; 1601 but his birth could not be\r\n      more obscure than was that of the greater part of his rivals, who\r\n      were born of peasants, and enlisted in the army as private\r\n      soldiers. In times of confusion every active genius finds the\r\n      place assigned him by nature: in a general state of war military\r\n      merit is the road to glory and to greatness. Of the nineteen\r\n      tyrants Tetricus only was a senator; Piso alone was a noble. The\r\n      blood of Numa, through twenty-eight successive generations, ran\r\n      in the veins of Calphurnius Piso, 161 who, by female alliances,\r\n      claimed a right of exhibiting, in his house, the images of\r\n      Crassus and of the great Pompey. 162 His ancestors had been\r\n      repeatedly dignified with all the honors which the commonwealth\r\n      could bestow; and of all the ancient families of Rome, the\r\n      Calphurnian alone had survived the tyranny of the Cæsars. The\r\n      personal qualities of Piso added new lustre to his race. The\r\n      usurper Valens, by whose order he was killed, confessed, with\r\n      deep remorse, that even an enemy ought to have respected the\r\n      sanctity of Piso; and although he died in arms against Gallienus,\r\n      the senate, with the emperor’s generous permission, decreed the\r\n      triumphal ornaments to the memory of so virtuous a rebel. 163\r\n\r\n      160 (return) [ See the speech of Marius in the Augustan History,\r\n      p. 197.

A Piso was deemed worthy of the\r\n      throne by Augustus, (Tacit. Annal. i. 13;) a second headed a\r\n      formidable conspiracy against Nero; and a third was adopted, and\r\n      declared Cæsar, by Galba.]\r\n\r\n      163 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 195. The senate, in a moment of\r\n      enthusiasm, seems to have presumed on the approbation of\r\n      Gallienus.]\r\n\r\n      The lieutenants of Valerian were grateful to the father, whom\r\n      they esteemed. They disdained to serve the luxurious indolence of\r\n      his unworthy son. The throne of the Roman world was unsupported\r\n      by any principle of loyalty; and treason against such a prince\r\n      might easily be considered as patriotism to the state. Yet if we\r\n      examine with candor the conduct of these usurpers, it will\r\n      appear, that they were much oftener driven into rebellion by\r\n      their fears, than urged to it by their ambition. They dreaded the\r\n      cruel suspicions of Gallienus; they equally dreaded the\r\n      capricious violence of their troops. If the dangerous favor of\r\n      the army had imprudently declared them deserving of the purple,\r\n      they were marked for sure destruction; and even prudence would\r\n      counsel them to secure a short enjoyment of empire, and rather to\r\n      try the fortune of war than to expect the hand of an executioner.\r\n\r\n      When the clamor of the soldiers invested the reluctant victims\r\n      with the ensigns of sovereign authority, they sometimes mourned\r\n      in secret their approaching fate. “You have lost,” said\r\n      Saturninus, on the day of his elevation, “you have lost a useful\r\n      commander, and you have made a very wretched emperor.” 164\r\n\r\n      164 (return) [ Hist. August p. 196.]\r\n\r\n      The apprehensions of Saturninus were justified by the repeated\r\n      experience of revolutions. Of the nineteen tyrants who started up\r\n      under the reign of Gallienus, there was not one who enjoyed a\r\n      life of peace, or a natural death. As soon as they were invested\r\n      with the bloody purple, they inspired their adherents with the\r\n      same fears and ambition which had occasioned their own revolt.\r\n      Encompassed with domestic conspiracy, military sedition, and\r\n      civil war, they trembled on the edge of precipices, in which,\r\n      after a longer or shorter term of anxiety, they were inevitably\r\n      lost. These precarious monarchs received, however, such honors as\r\n      the flattery of their respective armies and provinces could\r\n      bestow; but their claim, founded on rebellion, could never obtain\r\n      the sanction of law or history. Italy, Rome, and the senate,\r\n      constantly adhered to the cause of Gallienus, and he alone was\r\n      considered as the sovereign of the empire. That prince\r\n      condescended, indeed, to acknowledge the victorious arms of\r\n      Odenathus, who deserved the honorable distinction, by the\r\n      respectful conduct which he always maintained towards the son of\r\n      Valerian. With the general applause of the Romans, and the\r\n      consent of Gallienus, the senate conferred the title of Augustus\r\n      on the brave Palmyrenian; and seemed to intrust him with the\r\n      government of the East, which he already possessed, in so\r\n      independent a manner, that, like a private succession, he\r\n      bequeathed it to his illustrious widow, Zenobia. 165\r\n\r\n      165 (return) [ The association of the brave Palmyrenian was the\r\n      most popular act of the whole reign of Gallienus. Hist. August.\r\n      p. 180.]\r\n\r\n      The rapid and perpetual transitions from the cottage to the\r\n      throne, and from the throne to the grave, might have amused an\r\n      indifferent philosopher; were it possible for a philosopher to\r\n      remain indifferent amidst the general calamities of human kind.\r\n      The election of these precarious emperors, their power and their\r\n      death, were equally destructive to their subjects and adherents.\r\n      The price of their fatal elevation was instantly discharged to\r\n      the troops by an immense donative, drawn from the bowels of the\r\n      exhausted people. However virtuous was their character, however\r\n      pure their intentions, they found themselves reduced to the hard\r\n      necessity of supporting their usurpation by frequent acts of\r\n      rapine and cruelty. When they fell, they involved armies and\r\n      provinces in their fall. There is still extant a most savage\r\n      mandate from Gallienus to one of his ministers, after the\r\n      suppression of Ingenuus, who had assumed the purple in Illyricum.\r\n\r\n      “It is not enough,” says that soft but inhuman prince, “that you\r\n      exterminate such as have appeared in arms; the chance of battle\r\n      might have served me as effectually. The male sex of every age\r\n      must be extirpated; provided that, in the execution of the\r\n      children and old men, you can contrive means to save our\r\n      reputation. Let every one die who has dropped an expression, who\r\n      has entertained a thought against me, against _me_, the son of\r\n      Valerian, the father and brother of so many princes. 166 Remember\r\n      that Ingenuus was made emperor: tear, kill, hew in pieces. I\r\n      write to you with my own hand, and would inspire you with my own\r\n      feelings.” 167 Whilst the public forces of the state were\r\n      dissipated in private quarrels, the defenceless provinces lay\r\n      exposed to every invader. The bravest usurpers were compelled, by\r\n      the perplexity of their situation, to conclude ignominious\r\n      treaties with the common enemy, to purchase with oppressive\r\n      tributes the neutrality or services of the Barbarians, and to\r\n      introduce hostile and independent nations into the heart of the\r\n      Roman monarchy. 168\r\n\r\n      166 (return) [ Gallienus had given the titles of Cæsar and\r\n      Augustus to his son Saloninus, slain at Cologne by the usurper\r\n      Posthumus.

As far as\r\n      the barrenness of materials would permit, we have attempted to\r\n      trace, with order and perspicuity, the general events of that\r\n      calamitous period. There still remain some particular facts; I.\r\n      The disorders of Sicily; II. The tumults of Alexandria; and, III.\r\n      The rebellion of the Isaurians, which may serve to reflect a\r\n      strong light on the horrid picture.\r\n\r\n      I.

The situation of Sicily preserved it from the\r\n      Barbarians; nor could the disarmed province have supported a\r\n      usurper. The sufferings of that once flourishing and still\r\n      fertile island were inflicted by baser hands. A licentious crowd\r\n      of slaves and peasants reigned for a while over the plundered\r\n      country, and renewed the memory of the servile wars of more\r\n      ancient times. 169 Devastations, of which the husbandman was\r\n      either the victim or the accomplice, must have ruined the\r\n      agriculture of Sicily; and as the principal estates were the\r\n      property of the opulent senators of Rome, who often enclosed\r\n      within a farm the territory of an old republic, it is not\r\n      improbable, that this private injury might affect the capital\r\n      more deeply, than all the conquests of the Goths or the Persians.\r\n\r\n      169 (return) [ The Augustan History, p. 177. See Diodor. Sicul.\r\n      l. xxxiv.]\r\n\r\n      II. The foundation of Alexandria was a noble design, at once\r\n      conceived and executed by the son of Philip. The beautiful and\r\n      regular form of that great city, second only to Rome itself,\r\n      comprehended a circumference of fifteen miles; 170 it was peopled\r\n      by three hundred thousand free inhabitants, besides at least an\r\n      equal number of slaves. 171 The lucrative trade of Arabia and\r\n      India flowed through the port of Alexandria, to the capital and\r\n      provinces of the empire. 1711 Idleness was unknown. Some were\r\n      employed in blowing of glass, others in weaving of linen, others\r\n      again manufacturing the papyrus. Either sex, and every age, was\r\n      engaged in the pursuits of industry, nor did even the blind or\r\n      the lame want occupations suited to their condition. 172 But the\r\n      people of Alexandria, a various mixture of nations, united the\r\n      vanity and inconstancy of the Greeks with the superstition and\r\n      obstinacy of the Egyptians. The most trifling occasion, a\r\n      transient scarcity of flesh or lentils, the neglect of an\r\n      accustomed salutation, a mistake of precedency in the public\r\n      baths, or even a religious dispute, 173 were at any time\r\n      sufficient to kindle a sedition among that vast multitude, whose\r\n      resentments were furious and implacable. 174 After the captivity\r\n      of Valerian and the insolence of his son had relaxed the\r\n      authority of the laws, the Alexandrians abandoned themselves to\r\n      the ungoverned rage of their passions, and their unhappy country\r\n      was the theatre of a civil war, which continued (with a few short\r\n      and suspicious truces) above twelve years. 175 All intercourse\r\n      was cut off between the several quarters of the afflicted city,\r\n      every street was polluted with blood, every building of strength\r\n      converted into a citadel; nor did the tumults subside till a\r\n      considerable part of Alexandria was irretrievably ruined. The\r\n      spacious and magnificent district of Bruchion, 1751 with its\r\n      palaces and musæum, the residence of the kings and philosophers\r\n      of Egypt, is described above a century afterwards, as already\r\n      reduced to its present state of dreary solitude. 176\r\n\r\n      170 (return) [ Plin.

The obscure rebellion of Trebellianus, who assumed the purple in\r\nIsauria, a petty province of Asia Minor, was attended with strange and\r\nmemorable consequences. The pageant of royalty was soon destroyed by an\r\nofficer of Gallienus; but his followers, despairing of mercy, resolved\r\nto shake off their allegiance, not only to the emperor, but to the\r\nempire, and suddenly returned to the savage manners from which they had\r\nnever perfectly been reclaimed. Their craggy rocks, a branch of the\r\nwide-extended Taurus, protected their inaccessible retreat. The tillage\r\nof some fertile valleys 177 supplied them with necessaries, and a habit\r\nof rapine with the luxuries of life. In the heart of the Roman\r\nmonarchy, the Isaurians long continued a nation of wild barbarians.\r\nSucceeding princes, unable to reduce them to obedience, either by arms\r\nor policy, were compelled to acknowledge their weakness, by surrounding\r\nthe hostile and independent spot with a strong chain of fortifications,\r\n178 which often proved insufficient to restrain the incursions of these\r\ndomestic foes. The Isaurians, gradually extending their territory to\r\nthe sea-coast, subdued the western and mountainous part of Cilicia,\r\nformerly the nest of those daring pirates, against whom the republic\r\nhad once been obliged to exert its utmost force, under the conduct of\r\nthe great Pompey. 179\r\n\r\n      177 (return) [ Strabo, l. xiii. p. 569.]\r\n\r\n      178 (return) [ Hist.

It was the inevitable\r\n      consequence of rapine and oppression, which extirpated the\r\n      produce of the present and the hope of future harvests. Famine is\r\n      almost always followed by epidemical diseases, the effect of\r\n      scanty and unwholesome food. Other causes must, however, have\r\n      contributed to the furious plague, which, from the year two\r\n      hundred and fifty to the year two hundred and sixty-five, raged\r\n      without interruption in every province, every city, and almost\r\n      every family, of the Roman empire.

An\r\n      exact register was kept at Alexandria of all the citizens\r\n      entitled to receive the distribution of corn. It was found, that\r\n      the ancient number of those comprised between the ages of forty\r\n      and seventy, had been equal to the whole sum of claimants, from\r\n      fourteen to fourscore years of age, who remained alive after the\r\n      reign of Gallienus. 182 Applying this authentic fact to the most\r\n      correct tables of mortality, it evidently proves, that above half\r\n      the people of Alexandria had perished; and could we venture to\r\n      extend the analogy to the other provinces, we might suspect, that\r\n      war, pestilence, and famine, had consumed, in a few years, the\r\n      moiety of the human species. 183\r\n\r\n      182 (return) [ Euseb.

It was saved by a series of great princes,\r\n      who derived their obscure origin from the martial provinces of\r\n      Illyricum. Within a period of about thirty years, Claudius,\r\n      Aurelian, Probus, Diocletian and his colleagues, triumphed over\r\n      the foreign and domestic enemies of the state, reëstablished,\r\n      with the military discipline, the strength of the frontiers, and\r\n      deserved the glorious title of Restorers of the Roman world.\r\n\r\n      The removal of an effeminate tyrant made way for a succession of\r\n      heroes. The indignation of the people imputed all their\r\n      calamities to Gallienus, and the far greater part were, indeed,\r\n      the consequence of his dissolute manners and careless\r\n      administration. He was even destitute of a sense of honor, which\r\n      so frequently supplies the absence of public virtue; and as long\r\n      as he was permitted to enjoy the possession of Italy, a victory\r\n      of the barbarians, the loss of a province, or the rebellion of a\r\n      general, seldom disturbed the tranquil course of his pleasures.\r\n      At length, a considerable army, stationed on the Upper Danube,\r\n      invested with the Imperial purple their leader Aureolus; who,\r\n      disdaining a confined and barren reign over the mountains of\r\n      Rhætia, passed the Alps, occupied Milan, threatened Rome, and\r\n      challenged Gallienus to dispute in the field the sovereignty of\r\n      Italy. The emperor, provoked by the insult, and alarmed by the\r\n      instant danger, suddenly exerted that latent vigor which\r\n      sometimes broke through the indolence of his temper. Forcing\r\n      himself from the luxury of the palace, he appeared in arms at the\r\n      head of his legions, and advanced beyond the Po to encounter his\r\n      competitor. The corrupted name of Pontirolo 1 still preserves the\r\n      memory of a bridge over the Adda, which, during the action, must\r\n      have proved an object of the utmost importance to both armies.\r\n      The Rhætian usurper, after receiving a total defeat and a\r\n      dangerous wound, retired into Milan. The siege of that great city\r\n      was immediately formed; the walls were battered with every engine\r\n      in use among the ancients; and Aureolus, doubtful of his internal\r\n      strength, and hopeless of foreign succors already anticipated the\r\n      fatal consequences of unsuccessful rebellion.\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ Pons Aureoli, thirteen miles from Bergamo, and\r\n      thirty-two from Milan.

The\r\n      excellent relation of the Chevalier de Folard, who was present,\r\n      gives a very distinct idea of the ground. See Polybe de Folard,\r\n      tom. iii. p. 233-248.]\r\n\r\n      His last resource was an attempt to seduce the loyalty of the\r\n      besiegers. He scattered libels through the camp, inviting the\r\n      troops to desert an unworthy master, who sacrificed the public\r\n      happiness to his luxury, and the lives of his most valuable\r\n      subjects to the slightest suspicions. The arts of Aureolus\r\n      diffused fears and discontent among the principal officers of his\r\n      rival. A conspiracy was formed by Heraclianus, the Prætorian\r\n      præfect, by Marcian, a general of rank and reputation, and by\r\n      Cecrops, who commanded a numerous body of Dalmatian guards. The\r\n      death of Gallienus was resolved; and notwithstanding their desire\r\n      of first terminating the siege of Milan, the extreme danger which\r\n      accompanied every moment’s delay obliged them to hasten the\r\n      execution of their daring purpose. At a late hour of the night,\r\n      but while the emperor still protracted the pleasures of the\r\n      table, an alarm was suddenly given, that Aureolus, at the head of\r\n      all his forces, had made a desperate sally from the town;\r\n      Gallienus, who was never deficient in personal bravery, started\r\n      from his silken couch, and without allowing himself time either\r\n      to put on his armor, or to assemble his guards, he mounted on\r\n      horseback, and rode full speed towards the supposed place of the\r\n      attack. Encompassed by his declared or concealed enemies, he\r\n      soon, amidst the nocturnal tumult, received a mortal dart from an\r\n      uncertain hand. Before he expired, a patriotic sentiment rising\r\n      in the mind of Gallienus, induced him to name a deserving\r\n      successor; and it was his last request, that the Imperial\r\n      ornaments should be delivered to Claudius, who then commanded a\r\n      detached army in the neighborhood of Pavia. The report at least\r\n      was diligently propagated, and the order cheerfully obeyed by the\r\n      conspirators, who had already agreed to place Claudius on the\r\n      throne. On the first news of the emperor’s death, the troops\r\n      expressed some suspicion and resentment, till the one was\r\n      removed, and the other assuaged, by a donative of twenty pieces\r\n      of gold to each soldier. They then ratified the election, and\r\n      acknowledged the merit of their new sovereign. 2\r\n\r\n      2 (return) [ On the death of Gallienus, see Trebellius Pollio in\r\n      Hist.

We can only\r\n      discover that he was a native of one of the provinces bordering\r\n      on the Danube; that his youth was spent in arms, and that his\r\n      modest valor attracted the favor and confidence of Decius. The\r\n      senate and people already considered him as an excellent officer,\r\n      equal to the most important trusts; and censured the inattention\r\n      of Valerian, who suffered him to remain in the subordinate\r\n      station of a tribune. But it was not long before that emperor\r\n      distinguished the merit of Claudius, by declaring him general and\r\n      chief of the Illyrian frontier, with the command of all the\r\n      troops in Thrace, Mæsia, Dacia, Pannonia, and Dalmatia, the\r\n      appointments of the præfect of Egypt, the establishment of the\r\n      proconsul of Africa, and the sure prospect of the consulship. By\r\n      his victories over the Goths, he deserved from the senate the\r\n      honor of a statue, and excited the jealous apprehensions of\r\n      Gallienus. It was impossible that a soldier could esteem so\r\n      dissolute a sovereign, nor is it easy to conceal a just contempt.\r\n      Some unguarded expressions which dropped from Claudius were\r\n      officiously transmitted to the royal ear. The emperor’s answer to\r\n      an officer of confidence describes in very lively colors his own\r\n      character, and that of the times. “There is not any thing capable\r\n      of giving me more serious concern, than the intelligence\r\n      contained in your last despatch; 4 that some malicious\r\n      suggestions have indisposed towards us the mind of our friend and\r\n      _parent_ Claudius. As you regard your allegiance, use every means\r\n      to appease his resentment, but conduct your negotiation with\r\n      secrecy; let it not reach the knowledge of the Dacian troops;\r\n      they are already provoked, and it might inflame their fury. I\r\n      myself have sent him some presents: be it your care that he\r\n      accept them with pleasure. Above all, let him not suspect that I\r\n      am made acquainted with his imprudence. The fear of my anger\r\n      might urge him to desperate counsels.” 5 The presents which\r\n      accompanied this humble epistle, in which the monarch solicited a\r\n      reconciliation with his discontented subject, consisted of a\r\n      considerable sum of money, a splendid wardrobe, and a valuable\r\n      service of silver and gold plate. By such arts Gallienus softened\r\n      the indignation and dispelled the fears of his Illyrian general;\r\n      and during the remainder of that reign, the formidable sword of\r\n      Claudius was always drawn in the cause of a master whom he\r\n      despised. At last, indeed, he received from the conspirators the\r\n      bloody purple of Gallienus: but he had been absent from their\r\n      camp and counsels; and however he might applaud the deed, we may\r\n      candidly presume that he was innocent of the knowledge of it. 6\r\n      When Claudius ascended the throne, he was about fifty-four years\r\n      of age.\r\n\r\n      3 (return) [ Some supposed him, oddly enough, to be a bastard of\r\n      the younger Gordian. Others took advantage of the province of\r\n      Dardania, to deduce his origin from Dardanus, and the ancient\r\n      kings of Troy.]\r\n\r\n      4 (return) [ Notoria, a periodical and official despatch which\r\n      the emperor received from the frumentarii, or agents dispersed\r\n      through the provinces.

But we may\r\n      distrust the partiality of a kinsman.]\r\n\r\n      The siege of Milan was still continued, and Aureolus soon\r\n      discovered that the success of his artifices had only raised up a\r\n      more determined adversary. He attempted to negotiate with\r\n      Claudius a treaty of alliance and partition. “Tell him,” replied\r\n      the intrepid emperor, “that such proposals should have been made\r\n      to Gallienus; _he_, perhaps, might have listened to them with\r\n      patience, and accepted a colleague as despicable as himself.” 7\r\n      This stern refusal, and a last unsuccessful effort, obliged\r\n      Aureolus to yield the city and himself to the discretion of the\r\n      conqueror. The judgment of the army pronounced him worthy of\r\n      death; and Claudius, after a feeble resistance, consented to the\r\n      execution of the sentence. Nor was the zeal of the senate less\r\n      ardent in the cause of their new sovereign. They ratified,\r\n      perhaps with a sincere transport of zeal, the election of\r\n      Claudius; and, as his predecessor had shown himself the personal\r\n      enemy of their order, they exercised, under the name of justice,\r\n      a severe revenge against his friends and family. The senate was\r\n      permitted to discharge the ungrateful office of punishment, and\r\n      the emperor reserved for himself the pleasure and merit of\r\n      obtaining by his intercession a general act of indemnity. 8\r\n\r\n      7 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 203. There are some trifling\r\n      differences concerning the circumstances of the last defeat and\r\n      death of Aureolus]\r\n\r\n      8 (return) [ Aurelius Victor in Gallien. The people loudly prayed\r\n      for the damnation of Gallienus. The senate decreed that his\r\n      relations and servants should be thrown down headlong from the\r\n      Gemonian stairs. An obnoxious officer of the revenue had his eyes\r\n      torn out whilst under examination. Note: The expression is\r\n      curious, “terram matrem deosque inferos impias uti Gallieno\r\n      darent.”—M.]\r\n\r\n      Such ostentatious clemency discovers less of the real character\r\n      of Claudius, than a trifling circumstance in which he seems to\r\n      have consulted only the dictates of his heart. The frequent\r\n      rebellions of the provinces had involved almost every person in\r\n      the guilt of treason, almost every estate in the case of\r\n      confiscation; and Gallienus often displayed his liberality by\r\n      distributing among his officers the property of his subjects. On\r\n      the accession of Claudius, an old woman threw herself at his\r\n      feet, and complained that a general of the late emperor had\r\n      obtained an arbitrary grant of her patrimony. This general was\r\n      Claudius himself, who had not entirely escaped the contagion of\r\n      the times. The emperor blushed at the reproach, but deserved the\r\n      confidence which she had reposed in his equity. The confession of\r\n      his fault was accompanied with immediate and ample restitution. 9\r\n\r\n      9 (return) [ Zonaras, l. xii. p. 137.]\r\n\r\n      In the arduous task which Claudius had undertaken, of restoring\r\n      the empire to its ancient splendor, it was first necessary to\r\n      revive among his troops a sense of order and obedience. With the\r\n      authority of a veteran commander, he represented to them that the\r\n      relaxation of discipline had introduced a long train of\r\n      disorders, the effects of which were at length experienced by the\r\n      soldiers themselves; that a people ruined by oppression, and\r\n      indolent from despair, could no longer supply a numerous army\r\n      with the means of luxury, or even of subsistence; that the danger\r\n      of each individual had increased with the despotism of the\r\n      military order, since princes who tremble on the throne will\r\n      guard their safety by the instant sacrifice of every obnoxious\r\n      subject. The emperor expiated on the mischiefs of a lawless\r\n      caprice, which the soldiers could only gratify at the expense of\r\n      their own blood; as their seditious elections had so frequently\r\n      been followed by civil wars, which consumed the flower of the\r\n      legions either in the field of battle, or in the cruel abuse of\r\n      victory. He painted in the most lively colors the exhausted state\r\n      of the treasury, the desolation of the provinces, the disgrace of\r\n      the Roman name, and the insolent triumph of rapacious barbarians.\r\n      It was against those barbarians, he declared, that he intended to\r\n      point the first effort of their arms. Tetricus might reign for a\r\n      while over the West, and even Zenobia might preserve the dominion\r\n      of the East. 10 These usurpers were his personal adversaries; nor\r\n      could he think of indulging any private resentment till he had\r\n      saved an empire, whose impending ruin would, unless it was timely\r\n      prevented, crush both the army and the people.\r\n\r\n      10 (return) [ Zonaras on this occasion mentions Posthumus but the\r\n      registers of the senate (Hist. August. p. 203) prove that\r\n      Tetricus was already emperor of the western provinces.]\r\n\r\n      The various nations of Germany and Sarmatia, who fought under the\r\n      Gothic standard, had already collected an armament more\r\n      formidable than any which had yet issued from the Euxine. On the\r\n      banks of the Niester, one of the great rivers that discharge\r\n      themselves into that sea, they constructed a fleet of two\r\n      thousand, or even of six thousand vessels; 11 numbers which,\r\n      however incredible they may seem, would have been insufficient to\r\n      transport their pretended army of three hundred and twenty\r\n      thousand barbarians. Whatever might be the real strength of the\r\n      Goths, the vigor and success of the expedition were not adequate\r\n      to the greatness of the preparations. In their passage through\r\n      the Bosphorus, the unskilful pilots were overpowered by the\r\n      violence of the current; and while the multitude of their ships\r\n      were crowded in a narrow channel, many were dashed against each\r\n      other, or against the shore. The barbarians made several descents\r\n      on the coasts both of Europe and Asia; but the open country was\r\n      already plundered, and they were repulsed with shame and loss\r\n      from the fortified cities which they assaulted. A spirit of\r\n      discouragement and division arose in the fleet, and some of their\r\n      chiefs sailed away towards the islands of Crete and Cyprus; but\r\n      the main body, pursuing a more steady course, anchored at length\r\n      near the foot of Mount Athos, and assaulted the city of\r\n      Thessalonica, the wealthy capital of all the Macedonian\r\n      provinces. Their attacks, in which they displayed a fierce but\r\n      artless bravery, were soon interrupted by the rapid approach of\r\n      Claudius, hastening to a scene of action that deserved the\r\n      presence of a warlike prince at the head of the remaining powers\r\n      of the empire. Impatient for battle, the Goths immediately broke\r\n      up their camp, relinquished the siege of Thessalonica, left their\r\n      navy at the foot of Mount Athos, traversed the hills of\r\n      Macedonia, and pressed forwards to engage the last defence of\r\n      Italy.\r\n\r\n      11 (return) [ The Augustan History mentions the smaller, Zonaras\r\n      the larger number; the lively fancy of Montesquieu induced him to\r\n      prefer the latter.]\r\n\r\n      We still posses an original letter addressed by Claudius to the\r\n      senate and people on this memorable occasion. “Conscript\r\n      fathers,” says the emperor, “know that three hundred and twenty\r\n      thousand Goths have invaded the Roman territory. If I vanquish\r\n      them, your gratitude will reward my services. Should I fall,\r\n      remember that I am the successor of Gallienus. The whole republic\r\n      is fatigued and exhausted. We shall fight after Valerian, after\r\n      Ingenuus, Regillianus, Lollianus, Posthumus, Celsus, and a\r\n      thousand others, whom a just contempt for Gallienus provoked into\r\n      rebellion. We are in want of darts, of spears, and of shields.\r\n      The strength of the empire, Gaul, and Spain, are usurped by\r\n      Tetricus, and we blush to acknowledge that the archers of the\r\n      East serve under the banners of Zenobia. Whatever we shall\r\n      perform will be sufficiently great.” 12 The melancholy firmness\r\n      of this epistle announces a hero careless of his fate, conscious\r\n      of his danger, but still deriving a well-grounded hope from the\r\n      resources of his own mind.\r\n\r\n      12 (return) [ Trebell. Pollio in Hist. August. p. 204.]\r\n\r\n      The event surpassed his own expectations and those of the world.\r\n      By the most signal victories he delivered the empire from this\r\n      host of barbarians, and was distinguished by posterity under the\r\n      glorious appellation of the Gothic Claudius. The imperfect\r\n      historians of an irregular war 13 do not enable us to describe\r\n      the order and circumstances of his exploits; but, if we could be\r\n      indulged in the allusion, we might distribute into three acts\r\n      this memorable tragedy. I. The decisive battle was fought near\r\n      Naissus, a city of Dardania. The legions at first gave way,\r\n      oppressed by numbers, and dismayed by misfortunes. Their ruin was\r\n      inevitable, had not the abilities of their emperor prepared a\r\n      seasonable relief. A large detachment, rising out of the secret\r\n      and difficult passes of the mountains, which, by his order, they\r\n      had occupied, suddenly assailed the rear of the victorious Goths.\r\n\r\n      The favorable instant was improved by the activity of Claudius.\r\n      He revived the courage of his troops, restored their ranks, and\r\n      pressed the barbarians on every side. Fifty thousand men are\r\n      reported to have been slain in the battle of Naissus. Several\r\n      large bodies of barbarians, covering their retreat with a movable\r\n      fortification of wagons, retired, or rather escaped, from the\r\n      field of slaughter.\r\n\r\n      II. We may presume that some insurmountable difficulty, the\r\n      fatigue, perhaps, or the disobedience, of the conquerors,\r\n      prevented Claudius from completing in one day the destruction of\r\n      the Goths. The war was diffused over the province of Mæsia,\r\n      Thrace, and Macedonia, and its operations drawn out into a\r\n      variety of marches, surprises, and tumultuary engagements, as\r\n      well by sea as by land. When the Romans suffered any loss, it was\r\n      commonly occasioned by their own cowardice or rashness; but the\r\n      superior talents of the emperor, his perfect knowledge of the\r\n      country, and his judicious choice of measures as well as\r\n      officers, assured on most occasions the success of his arms. The\r\n      immense booty, the fruit of so many victories, consisted for the\r\n      greater part of cattle and slaves. A select body of the Gothic\r\n      youth was received among the Imperial troops; the remainder was\r\n      sold into servitude; and so considerable was the number of female\r\n      captives that every soldier obtained to his share two or three\r\n      women. A circumstance from which we may conclude, that the\r\n      invaders entertained some designs of settlement as well as of\r\n      plunder; since even in a naval expedition, they were accompanied\r\n      by their families.\r\n\r\n      III. The loss of their fleet, which was either taken or sunk, had\r\n      intercepted the retreat of the Goths. A vast circle of Roman\r\n      posts, distributed with skill, supported with firmness, and\r\n      gradually closing towards a common centre, forced the barbarians\r\n      into the most inaccessible parts of Mount Hæmus, where they found\r\n      a safe refuge, but a very scanty subsistence. During the course\r\n      of a rigorous winter in which they were besieged by the emperor’s\r\n      troops, famine and pestilence, desertion and the sword,\r\n      continually diminished the imprisoned multitude. On the return of\r\n      spring, nothing appeared in arms except a hardy and desperate\r\n      band, the remnant of that mighty host which had embarked at the\r\n      mouth of the Niester.\r\n\r\n      13 (return) [ Hist. August. in Claud. Aurelian. et Prob. Zosimus,\r\n      l. i. p. 38-42. Zonaras, l. xii. p. 638. Aurel. Victor in Epitom.\r\n      Victor Junior in Cæsar. Eutrop. ix ll. Euseb. in Chron.]\r\n\r\n      The pestilence which swept away such numbers of the barbarians,\r\n      at length proved fatal to their conqueror. After a short but\r\n      glorious reign of two years, Claudius expired at Sirmium, amidst\r\n      the tears and acclamations of his subjects. In his last illness,\r\n      he convened the principal officers of the state and army, and in\r\n      their presence recommended Aurelian, 14 one of his generals, as\r\n      the most deserving of the throne, and the best qualified to\r\n      execute the great design which he himself had been permitted only\r\n      to undertake. The virtues of Claudius, his valor, affability,\r\n      justice, and temperance, his love of fame and of his country,\r\n      place him in that short list of emperors who added lustre to the\r\n      Roman purple. Those virtues, however, were celebrated with\r\n      peculiar zeal and complacency by the courtly writers of the age\r\n      of Constantine, who was the great-grandson of Crispus, the elder\r\n      brother of Claudius. The voice of flattery was soon taught to\r\n      repeat, that gods, who so hastily had snatched Claudius from the\r\n      earth, rewarded his merit and piety by the perpetual\r\n      establishment of the empire in his family. 15\r\n\r\n      14 (return) [ According to Zonaras, (l. xii. p. 638,) Claudius,\r\n      before his death, invested him with the purple; but this singular\r\n      fact is rather contradicted than confirmed by other writers.]\r\n\r\n      15 (return) [ See the Life of Claudius by Pollio, and the\r\n      Orations of Mamertinus, Eumenius, and Julian. See likewise the\r\n      Cæsars of Julian p. 318. In Julian it was not adulation, but\r\n      superstition and vanity.]\r\n\r\n      Notwithstanding these oracles, the greatness of the Flavian\r\n      family (a name which it had pleased them to assume) was deferred\r\n      above twenty years, and the elevation of Claudius occasioned the\r\n      immediate ruin of his brother Quintilius, who possessed not\r\n      sufficient moderation or courage to descend into the private\r\n      station to which the patriotism of the late emperor had condemned\r\n      him. Without delay or reflection, he assumed the purple at\r\n      Aquileia, where he commanded a considerable force; and though his\r\n      reign lasted only seventeen days, 151 he had time to obtain the\r\n      sanction of the senate, and to experience a mutiny of the troops.\r\n\r\n      As soon as he was informed that the great army of the Danube had\r\n      invested the well-known valor of Aurelian with Imperial power, he\r\n      sunk under the fame and merit of his rival; and ordering his\r\n      veins to be opened, prudently withdrew himself from the unequal\r\n      contest. 16\r\n\r\n      151 (return) [ Such is the narrative of the greater part of the\r\n      older historians; but the number and the variety of his medals\r\n      seem to require more time, and give probability to the report of\r\n      Zosimus, who makes him reign some months.—G.]\r\n\r\n      16 (return) [ Zosimus, l. i. p. 42.

According to Dexippus, he died of a\r\n      disease.]\r\n\r\n      The general design of this work will not permit us minutely to\r\n      relate the actions of every emperor after he ascended the throne,\r\n      much less to deduce the various fortunes of his private life. We\r\n      shall only observe, that the father of Aurelian was a peasant of\r\n      the territory of Sirmium, who occupied a small farm, the property\r\n      of Aurelius, a rich senator. His warlike son enlisted in the\r\n      troops as a common soldier, successively rose to the rank of a\r\n      centurion, a tribune, the præfect of a legion, the inspector of\r\n      the camp, the general, or, as it was then called, the duke, of a\r\n      frontier; and at length, during the Gothic war, exercised the\r\n      important office of commander-in-chief of the cavalry. In every\r\n      station he distinguished himself by matchless valor, 17 rigid\r\n      discipline, and successful conduct. He was invested with the\r\n      consulship by the emperor Valerian, who styles him, in the\r\n      pompous language of that age, the deliverer of Illyricum, the\r\n      restorer of Gaul, and the rival of the Scipios. At the\r\n      recommendation of Valerian, a senator of the highest rank and\r\n      merit, Ulpius Crinitus, whose blood was derived from the same\r\n      source as that of Trajan, adopted the Pannonian peasant, gave him\r\n      his daughter in marriage, and relieved with his ample fortune the\r\n      honorable poverty which Aurelian had preserved inviolate. 18\r\n\r\n      17 (return) [ Theoclius (as quoted in the Augustan History, p.\r\n      211) affirms that in one day he killed with his own hand\r\n      forty-eight Sarmatians, and in several subsequent engagements\r\n      nine hundred and fifty. This heroic valor was admired by the\r\n      soldiers, and celebrated in their rude songs, the burden of which\r\n      was, mille, mile, mille, occidit.]\r\n\r\n      18 (return) [ Acholius (ap. Hist. August. p. 213) describes the\r\n      ceremony of the adoption, as it was performed at Byzantium, in\r\n      the presence of the emperor and his great officers.]\r\n\r\n      The reign of Aurelian lasted only four years and about nine\r\n      months; but every instant of that short period was filled by some\r\n      memorable achievement. He put an end to the Gothic war, chastised\r\n      the Germans who invaded Italy, recovered Gaul, Spain, and Britain\r\n      out of the hands of Tetricus, and destroyed the proud monarchy\r\n      which Zenobia had erected in the East on the ruins of the\r\n      afflicted empire.\r\n\r\n      It was the rigid attention of Aurelian, even to the minutest\r\n      articles of discipline, which bestowed such uninterrupted success\r\n      on his arms. His military regulations are contained in a very\r\n      concise epistle to one of his inferior officers, who is commanded\r\n      to enforce them, as he wishes to become a tribune, or as he is\r\n      desirous to live. Gaming, drinking, and the arts of divination,\r\n      were severely prohibited. Aurelian expected that his soldiers\r\n      should be modest, frugal, and laborious; that their armor should\r\n      be constantly kept bright, their weapons sharp, their clothing\r\n      and horses ready for immediate service; that they should live in\r\n      their quarters with chastity and sobriety, without damaging the\r\n      cornfields, without stealing even a sheep, a fowl, or a bunch of\r\n      grapes, without exacting from their landlords either salt, or\r\n      oil, or wood. “The public allowance,” continues the emperor, “is\r\n      sufficient for their support; their wealth should be collected\r\n      from the spoils of the enemy, not from the tears of the\r\n      provincials.” 19 A single instance will serve to display the\r\n      rigor, and even cruelty, of Aurelian. One of the soldiers had\r\n      seduced the wife of his host. The guilty wretch was fastened to\r\n      two trees forcibly drawn towards each other, and his limbs were\r\n      torn asunder by their sudden separation. A few such examples\r\n      impressed a salutary consternation. The punishments of Aurelian\r\n      were terrible; but he had seldom occasion to punish more than\r\n      once the same offence. His own conduct gave a sanction to his\r\n      laws, and the seditious legions dreaded a chief who had learned\r\n      to obey, and who was worthy to command.\r\n\r\n      19 (return) [ Hist.

The troops which guarded the passes of Mount Hæmus, and\r\n      the banks of the Danube, had been drawn away by the apprehension\r\n      of a civil war; and it seems probable that the remaining body of\r\n      the Gothic and Vandalic tribes embraced the favorable\r\n      opportunity, abandoned their settlements of the Ukraine,\r\n      traversed the rivers, and swelled with new multitudes the\r\n      destroying host of their countrymen. Their united numbers were at\r\n      length encountered by Aurelian, and the bloody and doubtful\r\n      conflict ended only with the approach of night. 20 Exhausted by\r\n      so many calamities, which they had mutually endured and inflicted\r\n      during a twenty years’ war, the Goths and the Romans consented to\r\n      a lasting and beneficial treaty. It was earnestly solicited by\r\n      the barbarians, and cheerfully ratified by the legions, to whose\r\n      suffrage the prudence of Aurelian referred the decision of that\r\n      important question. The Gothic nation engaged to supply the\r\n      armies of Rome with a body of two thousand auxiliaries,\r\n      consisting entirely of cavalry, and stipulated in return an\r\n      undisturbed retreat, with a regular market as far as the Danube,\r\n      provided by the emperor’s care, but at their own expense. The\r\n      treaty was observed with such religious fidelity, that when a\r\n      party of five hundred men straggled from the camp in quest of\r\n      plunder, the king or general of the barbarians commanded that the\r\n      guilty leader should be apprehended and shot to death with darts,\r\n      as a victim devoted to the sanctity of their engagements. 201 It\r\n      is, however, not unlikely, that the precaution of Aurelian, who\r\n      had exacted as hostages the sons and daughters of the Gothic\r\n      chiefs, contributed something to this pacific temper. The youths\r\n      he trained in the exercise of arms, and near his own person: to\r\n      the damsels he gave a liberal and Roman education, and by\r\n      bestowing them in marriage on some of his principal officers,\r\n      gradually introduced between the two nations the closest and most\r\n      endearing connections. 21\r\n\r\n      20 (return) [ Zosimus, l. i. p. 45.]\r\n\r\n      201 (return) [ The five hundred stragglers were all slain.—M.]\r\n\r\n      21 (return) [ Dexipphus (ap.

August. p.\r\n      247.]\r\n\r\n      But the most important condition of peace was understood rather\r\n      than expressed in the treaty. Aurelian withdrew the Roman forces\r\n      from Dacia, and tacitly relinquished that great province to the\r\n      Goths and Vandals. 22 His manly judgment convinced him of the\r\n      solid advantages, and taught him to despise the seeming disgrace,\r\n      of thus contracting the frontiers of the monarchy. The Dacian\r\n      subjects, removed from those distant possessions which they were\r\n      unable to cultivate or defend, added strength and populousness to\r\n      the southern side of the Danube. A fertile territory, which the\r\n      repetition of barbarous inroads had changed into a desert, was\r\n      yielded to their industry, and a new province of Dacia still\r\n      preserved the memory of Trajan’s conquests. The old country of\r\n      that name detained, however, a considerable number of its\r\n      inhabitants, who dreaded exile more than a Gothic master. 23\r\n      These degenerate Romans continued to serve the empire, whose\r\n      allegiance they had renounced, by introducing among their\r\n      conquerors the first notions of agriculture, the useful arts, and\r\n      the conveniences of civilized life. An intercourse of commerce\r\n      and language was gradually established between the opposite banks\r\n      of the Danube; and after Dacia became an independent state, it\r\n      often proved the firmest barrier of the empire against the\r\n      invasions of the savages of the North. A sense of interest\r\n      attached these more settled barbarians to the alliance of Rome,\r\n      and a permanent interest very frequently ripens into sincere and\r\n      useful friendship. This various colony, which filled the ancient\r\n      province, and was insensibly blended into one great people, still\r\n      acknowledged the superior renown and authority of the Gothic\r\n      tribe, and claimed the fancied honor of a Scandinavian origin. At\r\n      the same time, the lucky though accidental resemblance of the\r\n      name of Getæ, 231 infused among the credulous Goths a vain\r\n      persuasion, that in a remote age, their own ancestors, already\r\n      seated in the Dacian provinces, had received the instructions of\r\n      Zamolxis, and checked the victorious arms of Sesostris and\r\n      Darius. 24\r\n\r\n      22 (return) [ Hist.

Forty thousand horse appeared in the\r\n      field, 26 and the numbers of the infantry doubled those of the\r\n      cavalry. 27 The first objects of their avarice were a few cities\r\n      of the Rhætian frontier; but their hopes soon rising with\r\n      success, the rapid march of the Alemanni traced a line of\r\n      devastation from the Danube to the Po. 28\r\n\r\n      25 (return) [ Dexippus, p. 7—12.

Collecting an\r\n      active body of troops, he marched with silence and celerity along\r\n      the skirts of the Hercynian forest; and the Alemanni, laden with\r\n      the spoils of Italy, arrived at the Danube, without suspecting,\r\n      that on the opposite bank, and in an advantageous post, a Roman\r\n      army lay concealed and prepared to intercept their return.\r\n      Aurelian indulged the fatal security of the barbarians, and\r\n      permitted about half their forces to pass the river without\r\n      disturbance and without precaution. Their situation and\r\n      astonishment gave him an easy victory; his skilful conduct\r\n      improved the advantage. Disposing the legions in a semicircular\r\n      form, he advanced the two horns of the crescent across the\r\n      Danube, and wheeling them on a sudden towards the centre,\r\n      enclosed the rear of the German host. The dismayed barbarians, on\r\n      whatsoever side they cast their eyes, beheld, with despair, a\r\n      wasted country, a deep and rapid stream, a victorious and\r\n      implacable enemy.\r\n\r\n      Reduced to this distressed condition, the Alemanni no longer\r\n      disdained to sue for peace. Aurelian received their ambassadors\r\n      at the head of his camp, and with every circumstance of martial\r\n      pomp that could display the greatness and discipline of Rome. The\r\n      legions stood to their arms in well-ordered ranks and awful\r\n      silence. The principal commanders, distinguished by the ensigns\r\n      of their rank, appeared on horseback on either side of the\r\n      Imperial throne. Behind the throne the consecrated images of the\r\n      emperor, and his predecessors, 29 the golden eagles, and the\r\n      various titles of the legions, engraved in letters of gold, were\r\n      exalted in the air on lofty pikes covered with silver. When\r\n      Aurelian assumed his seat, his manly grace and majestic figure 30\r\n      taught the barbarians to revere the person as well as the purple\r\n      of their conqueror. The ambassadors fell prostrate on the ground\r\n      in silence. They were commanded to rise, and permitted to speak.\r\n      By the assistance of interpreters they extenuated their perfidy,\r\n      magnified their exploits, expatiated on the vicissitudes of\r\n      fortune and the advantages of peace, and, with an ill-timed\r\n      confidence, demanded a large subsidy, as the price of the\r\n      alliance which they offered to the Romans. The answer of the\r\n      emperor was stern and imperious. He treated their offer with\r\n      contempt, and their demand with indignation, reproached the\r\n      barbarians, that they were as ignorant of the arts of war as of\r\n      the laws of peace, and finally dismissed them with the choice\r\n      only of submitting to this unconditional mercy, or awaiting the\r\n      utmost severity of his resentment. 31 Aurelian had resigned a\r\n      distant province to the Goths; but it was dangerous to trust or\r\n      to pardon these perfidious barbarians, whose formidable power\r\n      kept Italy itself in perpetual alarms.\r\n\r\n      29 (return) [ The emperor Claudius was certainly of the number;\r\n      but we are ignorant how far this mark of respect was extended; if\r\n      to Cæsar and Augustus, it must have produced a very awful\r\n      spectacle; a long line of the masters of the world.]\r\n\r\n      30 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist.

But an active despair has often triumphed\r\n      over the indolent assurance of success. The barbarians, finding\r\n      it impossible to traverse the Danube and the Roman camp, broke\r\n      through the posts in their rear, which were more feebly or less\r\n      carefully guarded; and with incredible diligence, but by a\r\n      different road, returned towards the mountains of Italy. 32\r\n      Aurelian, who considered the war as totally extinguished,\r\n      received the mortifying intelligence of the escape of the\r\n      Alemanni, and of the ravage which they already committed in the\r\n      territory of Milan. The legions were commanded to follow, with as\r\n      much expedition as those heavy bodies were capable of exerting,\r\n      the rapid flight of an enemy whose infantry and cavalry moved\r\n      with almost equal swiftness. A few days afterwards, the emperor\r\n      himself marched to the relief of Italy, at the head of a chosen\r\n      body of auxiliaries, (among whom were the hostages and cavalry of\r\n      the Vandals,) and of all the Prætorian guards who had served in\r\n      the wars on the Danube. 33\r\n\r\n      32 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 215.]\r\n\r\n      33 (return) [ Dexippus, p. 12.]\r\n\r\n      As the light troops of the Alemanni had spread themselves from\r\n      the Alps to the Apennine, the incessant vigilance of Aurelian and\r\n      his officers was exercised in the discovery, the attack, and the\r\n      pursuit of the numerous detachments. Notwithstanding this\r\n      desultory war, three considerable battles are mentioned, in which\r\n      the principal force of both armies was obstinately engaged. 34\r\n      The success was various. In the first, fought near Placentia, the\r\n      Romans received so severe a blow, that, according to the\r\n      expression of a writer extremely partial to Aurelian, the\r\n      immediate dissolution of the empire was apprehended. 35 The\r\n      crafty barbarians, who had lined the woods, suddenly attacked the\r\n      legions in the dusk of the evening, and, it is most probable,\r\n      after the fatigue and disorder of a long march.\r\n\r\n      The fury of their charge was irresistible; but, at length, after\r\n      a dreadful slaughter, the patient firmness of the emperor rallied\r\n      his troops, and restored, in some degree, the honor of his arms.\r\n      The second battle was fought near Fano in Umbria; on the spot\r\n      which, five hundred years before, had been fatal to the brother\r\n      of Hannibal. 36 Thus far the successful Germans had advanced\r\n      along the Æmilian and Flaminian way, with a design of sacking the\r\n      defenceless mistress of the world. But Aurelian, who, watchful\r\n      for the safety of Rome, still hung on their rear, found in this\r\n      place the decisive moment of giving them a total and\r\n      irretrievable defeat. 37 The flying remnant of their host was\r\n      exterminated in a third and last battle near Pavia; and Italy was\r\n      delivered from the inroads of the Alemanni.\r\n\r\n      34 (return) [ Victor Junior in Aurelian.]\r\n\r\n      35 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist.

Though the best hope of the republic was in\r\n      the valor and conduct of Aurelian, yet such was the public\r\n      consternation, when the barbarians were hourly expected at the\r\n      gates of Rome, that, by a decree of the senate the Sibylline\r\n      books were consulted. Even the emperor himself, from a motive\r\n      either of religion or of policy, recommended this salutary\r\n      measure, chided the tardiness of the senate, 38 and offered to\r\n      supply whatever expense, whatever animals, whatever captives of\r\n      any nation, the gods should require. Notwithstanding this liberal\r\n      offer, it does not appear, that any human victims expiated with\r\n      their blood the sins of the Roman people. The Sibylline books\r\n      enjoined ceremonies of a more harmless nature, processions of\r\n      priests in white robes, attended by a chorus of youths and\r\n      virgins; lustrations of the city and adjacent country; and\r\n      sacrifices, whose powerful influence disabled the barbarians from\r\n      passing the mystic ground on which they had been celebrated.\r\n      However puerile in themselves, these superstitious arts were\r\n      subservient to the success of the war; and if, in the decisive\r\n      battle of Fano, the Alemanni fancied they saw an army of spectres\r\n      combating on the side of Aurelian, he received a real and\r\n      effectual aid from this imaginary reënforcement. 39\r\n\r\n      38 (return) [ One should imagine, he said, that you were\r\n      assembled in a Christian church, not in the temple of all the\r\n      gods.]\r\n\r\n      39 (return) [ Vopiscus, in Hist. August. p. 215, 216, gives a\r\n      long account of these ceremonies from the Registers of the\r\n      senate.]\r\n\r\n      But whatever confidence might be placed in ideal ramparts, the\r\n      experience of the past, and the dread of the future, induced the\r\n      Romans to construct fortifications of a grosser and more\r\n      substantial kind. The seven hills of Rome had been surrounded by\r\n      the successors of Romulus with an ancient wall of more than\r\n      thirteen miles. 40 The vast enclosure may seem disproportioned to\r\n      the strength and numbers of the infant-state. But it was\r\n      necessary to secure an ample extent of pasture and arable land\r\n      against the frequent and sudden incursions of the tribes of\r\n      Latium, the perpetual enemies of the republic. With the progress\r\n      of Roman greatness, the city and its inhabitants gradually\r\n      increased, filled up the vacant space, pierced through the\r\n      useless walls, covered the field of Mars, and, on every side,\r\n      followed the public highways in long and beautiful suburbs. 41\r\n      The extent of the new walls, erected by Aurelian, and finished in\r\n      the reign of Probus, was magnified by popular estimation to near\r\n      fifty, 42 but is reduced by accurate measurement to about\r\n      twenty-one miles. 43 It was a great but a melancholy labor, since\r\n      the defence of the capital betrayed the decline of monarchy. The\r\n      Romans of a more prosperous age, who trusted to the arms of the\r\n      legions the safety of the frontier camps, 44 were very far from\r\n      entertaining a suspicion that it would ever become necessary to\r\n      fortify the seat of empire against the inroads of the barbarians.\r\n      45\r\n\r\n      40 (return) [ Plin.

To chastise domestic tyrants, and to reunite the\r\n      dismembered parts of the empire, was a task reserved for the\r\n      second of those warlike emperors. Though he was acknowledged by\r\n      the senate and people, the frontiers of Italy, Africa, Illyricum,\r\n      and Thrace, confined the limits of his reign. Gaul, Spain, and\r\n      Britain, Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor, were still possessed by\r\n      two rebels, who alone, out of so numerous a list, had hitherto\r\n      escaped the dangers of their situation; and to complete the\r\n      ignominy of Rome, these rival thrones had been usurped by women.\r\n\r\n      A rapid succession of monarchs had arisen and fallen in the\r\n      provinces of Gaul. The rigid virtues of Posthumus served only to\r\n      hasten his destruction. After suppressing a competitor, who had\r\n      assumed the purple at Mentz, he refused to gratify his troops\r\n      with the plunder of the rebellious city; and in the seventh year\r\n      of his reign, became the victim of their disappointed avarice. 46\r\n      The death of Victorinus, his friend and associate, was occasioned\r\n      by a less worthy cause. The shining accomplishments 47 of that\r\n      prince were stained by a licentious passion, which he indulged in\r\n      acts of violence, with too little regard to the laws of society,\r\n      or even to those of love. 48 He was slain at Cologne, by a\r\n      conspiracy of jealous husbands, whose revenge would have appeared\r\n      more justifiable, had they spared the innocence of his son. After\r\n      the murder of so many valiant princes, it is somewhat remarkable,\r\n      that a female for a long time controlled the fierce legions of\r\n      Gaul, and still more singular, that she was the mother of the\r\n      unfortunate Victorinus. The arts and treasures of Victoria\r\n      enabled her successively to place Marius and Tetricus on the\r\n      throne, and to reign with a manly vigor under the name of those\r\n      dependent emperors. Money of copper, of silver, and of gold, was\r\n      coined in her name; she assumed the titles of Augusta and Mother\r\n      of the Camps: her power ended only with her life; but her life\r\n      was perhaps shortened by the ingratitude of Tetricus. 49\r\n\r\n      46 (return) [ His competitor was Lollianus, or Ælianus, if,\r\n      indeed, these names mean the same person.

He reigned four or five years over Gaul, Spain, and\r\n      Britain, the slave and sovereign of a licentious army, whom he\r\n      dreaded, and by whom he was despised. The valor and fortune of\r\n      Aurelian at length opened the prospect of a deliverance. He\r\n      ventured to disclose his melancholy situation, and conjured the\r\n      emperor to hasten to the relief of his unhappy rival. Had this\r\n      secret correspondence reached the ears of the soldiers, it would\r\n      most probably have cost Tetricus his life; nor could he resign\r\n      the sceptre of the West without committing an act of treason\r\n      against himself.

But if we except the doubtful achievements of\r\n      Semiramis, Zenobia is perhaps the only female whose superior\r\n      genius broke through the servile indolence imposed on her sex by\r\n      the climate and manners of Asia. 54 She claimed her descent from\r\n      the Macedonian kings of Egypt, 541 equalled in beauty her\r\n      ancestor Cleopatra, and far surpassed that princess in chastity\r\n      55 and valor. Zenobia was esteemed the most lovely as well as the\r\n      most heroic of her sex. She was of a dark complexion (for in\r\n      speaking of a lady these trifles become important). Her teeth\r\n      were of a pearly whiteness, and her large black eyes sparkled\r\n      with uncommon fire, tempered by the most attractive sweetness.\r\n      Her voice was strong and harmonious. Her manly understanding was\r\n      strengthened and adorned by study. She was not ignorant of the\r\n      Latin tongue, but possessed in equal perfection the Greek, the\r\n      Syriac, and the Egyptian languages. She had drawn up for her own\r\n      use an epitome of oriental history, and familiarly compared the\r\n      beauties of Homer and Plato under the tuition of the sublime\r\n      Longinus.\r\n\r\n      54 (return) [ Almost everything that is said of the manners of\r\n      Odenathus and Zenobia is taken from their lives in the Augustan\r\n      History, by Trebeljus Pollio; see p. 192, 198.]\r\n\r\n      541 (return) [ According to some Christian writers, Zenobia was a\r\n      Jewess.

In the\r\n      intervals of war, Odenathus passionately delighted in the\r\n      exercise of hunting; he pursued with ardor the wild beasts of the\r\n      desert, lions, panthers, and bears; and the ardor of Zenobia in\r\n      that dangerous amusement was not inferior to his own. She had\r\n      inured her constitution to fatigue, disdained the use of a\r\n      covered carriage, generally appeared on horseback in a military\r\n      habit, and sometimes marched several miles on foot at the head of\r\n      the troops. The success of Odenathus was in a great measure\r\n      ascribed to her incomparable prudence and fortitude. Their\r\n      splendid victories over the Great King, whom they twice pursued\r\n      as far as the gates of Ctesiphon, laid the foundations of their\r\n      united fame and power. The armies which they commanded, and the\r\n      provinces which they had saved, acknowledged not any other\r\n      sovereigns than their invincible chiefs. The senate and people of\r\n      Rome revered a stranger who had avenged their captive emperor,\r\n      and even the insensible son of Valerian accepted Odenathus for\r\n      his legitimate colleague.\r\n\r\n      551 (return) [ According to Zosimus, Odenathus was of a noble\r\n      family in Palmyra and according to Procopius, he was prince of\r\n      the Saracens, who inhabit the ranks of the Euphrates.

Invincible in war, he was there cut off by domestic\r\n      treason, and his favorite amusement of hunting was the cause, or\r\n      at least the occasion, of his death. 56 His nephew Mæonius\r\n      presumed to dart his javelin before that of his uncle; and though\r\n      admonished of his error, repeated the same insolence. As a\r\n      monarch, and as a sportsman, Odenathus was provoked, took away\r\n      his horse, a mark of ignominy among the barbarians, and chastised\r\n      the rash youth by a short confinement. The offence was soon\r\n      forgot, but the punishment was remembered; and Mæonius, with a\r\n      few daring associates, assassinated his uncle in the midst of a\r\n      great entertainment. Herod, the son of Odenathus, though not of\r\n      Zenobia, a young man of a soft and effeminate temper, 57 was\r\n      killed with his father. But Mæonius obtained only the pleasure of\r\n      revenge by this bloody deed. He had scarcely time to assume the\r\n      title of Augustus, before he was sacrificed by Zenobia to the\r\n      memory of her husband. 58\r\n\r\n      56 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 192, 193.

By the death of\r\n      Odenathus, that authority was at an end which the senate had\r\n      granted him only as a personal distinction; but his martial\r\n      widow, disdaining both the senate and Gallienus, obliged one of\r\n      the Roman generals, who was sent against her, to retreat into\r\n      Europe, with the loss of his army and his reputation. 59 Instead\r\n      of the little passions which so frequently perplex a female\r\n      reign, the steady administration of Zenobia was guided by the\r\n      most judicious maxims of policy. If it was expedient to pardon,\r\n      she could calm her resentment; if it was necessary to punish, she\r\n      could impose silence on the voice of pity. Her strict economy was\r\n      accused of avarice; yet on every proper occasion she appeared\r\n      magnificent and liberal. The neighboring states of Arabia,\r\n      Armenia, and Persia, dreaded her enmity, and solicited her\r\n      alliance. To the dominions of Odenathus, which extended from the\r\n      Euphrates to the frontiers of Bithynia, his widow added the\r\n      inheritance of her ancestors, the populous and fertile kingdom of\r\n      Egypt. 60 The emperor Claudius acknowledged her merit, and was\r\n      content, that, while _he_ pursued the Gothic war, _she_ should\r\n      assert the dignity of the empire in the East. The conduct,\r\n      however, of Zenobia was attended with some ambiguity; not is it\r\n      unlikely that she had conceived the design of erecting an\r\n      independent and hostile monarchy. She blended with the popular\r\n      manners of Roman princes the stately pomp of the courts of Asia,\r\n      and exacted from her subjects the same adoration that was paid to\r\n      the successor of Cyrus. She bestowed on her three sons 61 a Latin\r\n      education, and often showed them to the troops adorned with the\r\n      Imperial purple. For herself she reserved the diadem, with the\r\n      splendid but doubtful title of Queen of the East.\r\n\r\n      59 (return) [ Hist.

Claudius, during all his\r\n      reign, is represented as emperor on the medals of Alexandria,\r\n      which are very numerous. If Zenobia possessed any power in Egypt,\r\n      it could only have been at the beginning of the reign of\r\n      Aurelian. The same circumstance throws great improbability on her\r\n      conquests in Galatia.

See\r\n      Tillemont, tom. 3, p. 1190.]\r\n\r\n      When Aurelian passed over into Asia, against an adversary whose\r\n      sex alone could render her an object of contempt, his presence\r\n      restored obedience to the province of Bithynia, already shaken by\r\n      the arms and intrigues of Zenobia. 62 Advancing at the head of\r\n      his legions, he accepted the submission of Ancyra, and was\r\n      admitted into Tyana, after an obstinate siege, by the help of a\r\n      perfidious citizen. The generous though fierce temper of Aurelian\r\n      abandoned the traitor to the rage of the soldiers; a\r\n      superstitious reverence induced him to treat with lenity the\r\n      countrymen of Apollonius the philosopher. 63 Antioch was deserted\r\n      on his approach, till the emperor, by his salutary edicts,\r\n      recalled the fugitives, and granted a general pardon to all who,\r\n      from necessity rather than choice, had been engaged in the\r\n      service of the Palmyrenian Queen. The unexpected mildness of such\r\n      a conduct reconciled the minds of the Syrians, and as far as the\r\n      gates of Emesa, the wishes of the people seconded the terror of\r\n      his arms. 64\r\n\r\n      62 (return) [ Zosimus, l. i. p. 44.]\r\n\r\n      63 (return) [ Vopiscus (in Hist.

His life\r\n      (that of the former) is related in so fabulous a manner by his\r\n      disciples, that we are at a loss to discover whether he was a\r\n      sage, an impostor, or a fanatic.]\r\n\r\n      64 (return) [ Zosimus, l. i. p. 46.]\r\n\r\n      Zenobia would have ill deserved her reputation, had she\r\n      indolently permitted the emperor of the West to approach within a\r\n      hundred miles of her capital. The fate of the East was decided in\r\n      two great battles; so similar in almost every circumstance, that\r\n      we can scarcely distinguish them from each other, except by\r\n      observing that the first was fought near Antioch, 65 and the\r\n      second near Emesa. 66 In both the queen of Palmyra animated the\r\n      armies by her presence, and devolved the execution of her orders\r\n      on Zabdas, who had already signalized his military talents by the\r\n      conquest of Egypt. The numerous forces of Zenobia consisted for\r\n      the most part of light archers, and of heavy cavalry clothed in\r\n      complete steel. The Moorish and Illyrian horse of Aurelian were\r\n      unable to sustain the ponderous charge of their antagonists. They\r\n      fled in real or affected disorder, engaged the Palmyrenians in a\r\n      laborious pursuit, harassed them by a desultory combat, and at\r\n      length discomfited this impenetrable but unwieldy body of\r\n      cavalry. The light infantry, in the mean time, when they had\r\n      exhausted their quivers, remaining without protection against a\r\n      closer onset, exposed their naked sides to the swords of the\r\n      legions. Aurelian had chosen these veteran troops, who were\r\n      usually stationed on the Upper Danube, and whose valor had been\r\n      severely tried in the Alemannic war. 67 After the defeat of\r\n      Emesa, Zenobia found it impossible to collect a third army. As\r\n      far as the frontier of Egypt, the nations subject to her empire\r\n      had joined the standard of the conqueror, who detached Probus,\r\n      the bravest of his generals, to possess himself of the Egyptian\r\n      provinces. Palmyra was the last resource of the widow of\r\n      Odenathus. She retired within the walls of her capital, made\r\n      every preparation for a vigorous resistance, and declared, with\r\n      the intrepidity of a heroine, that the last moment of her reign\r\n      and of her life should be the same.\r\n\r\n      65 (return) [ At a place called Immæ.

His account of the two\r\n      battles is clear and circumstantial.]\r\n\r\n      Amid the barren deserts of Arabia, a few cultivated spots rise\r\n      like islands out of the sandy ocean. Even the name of Tadmor, or\r\n      Palmyra, by its signification in the Syriac as well as in the\r\n      Latin language, denoted the multitude of palm-trees which\r\n      afforded shade and verdure to that temperate region. The air was\r\n      pure, and the soil, watered by some invaluable springs, was\r\n      capable of producing fruits as well as corn. A place possessed of\r\n      such singular advantages, and situated at a convenient distance\r\n      68 between the Gulf of Persia and the Mediterranean, was soon\r\n      frequented by the caravans which conveyed to the nations of\r\n      Europe a considerable part of the rich commodities of India.\r\n      Palmyra insensibly increased into an opulent and independent\r\n      city, and connecting the Roman and the Parthian monarchies by the\r\n      mutual benefits of commerce, was suffered to observe an humble\r\n      neutrality, till at length, after the victories of Trajan, the\r\n      little republic sunk into the bosom of Rome, and flourished more\r\n      than one hundred and fifty years in the subordinate though\r\n      honorable rank of a colony. It was during that peaceful period,\r\n      if we may judge from a few remaining inscriptions, that the\r\n      wealthy Palmyrenians constructed those temples, palaces, and\r\n      porticos of Grecian architecture, whose ruins, scattered over an\r\n      extent of several miles, have deserved the curiosity of our\r\n      travellers. The elevation of Odenathus and Zenobia appeared to\r\n      reflect new splendor on their country, and Palmyra, for a while,\r\n      stood forth the rival of Rome: but the competition was fatal, and\r\n      ages of prosperity were sacrificed to a moment of glory. 69\r\n\r\n      68 (return) [ It was five hundred and thirty-seven miles from\r\n      Seleucia, and two hundred and three from the nearest coast of\r\n      Syria, according to the reckoning of Pliny, who, in a few words,\r\n      (Hist.

For the history of Palmyra, we may consult the\r\n      masterly dissertation of Dr. Halley in the Philosophical\r\n      Transactions: Lowthorp’s Abridgment, vol. iii. p. 518.]\r\n\r\n      In his march over the sandy desert between Emesa and Palmyra, the\r\n      emperor Aurelian was perpetually harassed by the Arabs; nor could\r\n      he always defend his army, and especially his baggage, from those\r\n      flying troops of active and daring robbers, who watched the\r\n      moment of surprise, and eluded the slow pursuit of the legions.\r\n      The siege of Palmyra was an object far more difficult and\r\n      important, and the emperor, who, with incessant vigor, pressed\r\n      the attacks in person, was himself wounded with a dart. “The\r\n      Roman people,” says Aurelian, in an original letter, “speak with\r\n      contempt of the war which I am waging against a woman. They are\r\n      ignorant both of the character and of the power of Zenobia. It is\r\n      impossible to enumerate her warlike preparations, of stones, of\r\n      arrows, and of every species of missile weapons. Every part of\r\n      the walls is provided with two or three _balistæ_ and artificial\r\n      fires are thrown from her military engines. The fear of\r\n      punishment has armed her with a desperate courage. Yet still I\r\n      trust in the protecting deities of Rome, who have hitherto been\r\n      favorable to all my undertakings.” 70 Doubtful, however, of the\r\n      protection of the gods, and of the event of the siege, Aurelian\r\n      judged it more prudent to offer terms of an advantageous\r\n      capitulation; to the queen, a splendid retreat; to the citizens,\r\n      their ancient privileges. His proposals were obstinately\r\n      rejected, and the refusal was accompanied with insult.\r\n\r\n      70 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 218.]\r\n\r\n      The firmness of Zenobia was supported by the hope, that in a very\r\n      short time famine would compel the Roman army to repass the\r\n      desert; and by the reasonable expectation that the kings of the\r\n      East, and particularly the Persian monarch, would arm in the\r\n      defence of their most natural ally. But fortune, and the\r\n      perseverance of Aurelian, overcame every obstacle. The death of\r\n      Sapor, which happened about this time, 71 distracted the councils\r\n      of Persia, and the inconsiderable succors that attempted to\r\n      relieve Palmyra were easily intercepted either by the arms or the\r\n      liberality of the emperor. From every part of Syria, a regular\r\n      succession of convoys safely arrived in the camp, which was\r\n      increased by the return of Probus with his victorious troops from\r\n      the conquest of Egypt. It was then that Zenobia resolved to fly.\r\n      She mounted the fleetest of her dromedaries, 72 and had already\r\n      reached the banks of the Euphrates, about sixty miles from\r\n      Palmyra, when she was overtaken by the pursuit of Aurelian’s\r\n      light horse, seized, and brought back a captive to the feet of\r\n      the emperor. Her capital soon afterwards surrendered, and was\r\n      treated with unexpected lenity. The arms, horses, and camels,\r\n      with an immense treasure of gold, silver, silk, and precious\r\n      stones, were all delivered to the conqueror, who, leaving only a\r\n      garrison of six hundred archers, returned to Emesa, and employed\r\n      some time in the distribution of rewards and punishments at the\r\n      end of so memorable a war, which restored to the obedience of\r\n      Rome those provinces that had renounced their allegiance since\r\n      the captivity of Valerian.\r\n\r\n      71 (return) [ From a very doubtful chronology I have endeavored\r\n      to extract the most probable date.]\r\n\r\n      72 (return) [ Hist.

Though\r\n      the camel is a heavy beast of burden, the dromedary, which is\r\n      either of the same or of a kindred species, is used by the\r\n      natives of Asia and Africa on all occasions which require\r\n      celerity. The Arabs affirm, that he will run over as much ground\r\n      in one day as their fleetest horses can perform in eight or ten.\r\n      See Buffon, Hist. Naturelle, tom. xi. p. 222, and Shaw’s Travels\r\n      p. 167]\r\n\r\n      When the Syrian queen was brought into the presence of Aurelian,\r\n      he sternly asked her, How she had presumed to rise in arms\r\n      against the emperors of Rome! The answer of Zenobia was a prudent\r\n      mixture of respect and firmness. “Because I disdained to consider\r\n      as Roman emperors an Aureolus or a Gallienus. You alone I\r\n      acknowledge as my conqueror and my sovereign.” 73 But as female\r\n      fortitude is commonly artificial, so it is seldom steady or\r\n      consistent. The courage of Zenobia deserted her in the hour of\r\n      trial; she trembled at the angry clamors of the soldiers, who\r\n      called aloud for her immediate execution, forgot the generous\r\n      despair of Cleopatra, which she had proposed as her model, and\r\n      ignominiously purchased life by the sacrifice of her fame and her\r\n      friends. It was to their counsels, which governed the weakness of\r\n      her sex, that she imputed the guilt of her obstinate resistance;\r\n      it was on their heads that she directed the vengeance of the\r\n      cruel Aurelian. The fame of Longinus, who was included among the\r\n      numerous and perhaps innocent victims of her fear, will survive\r\n      that of the queen who betrayed, or the tyrant who condemned him.\r\n      Genius and learning were incapable of moving a fierce unlettered\r\n      soldier, but they had served to elevate and harmonize the soul of\r\n      Longinus. Without uttering a complaint, he calmly followed the\r\n      executioner, pitying his unhappy mistress, and bestowing comfort\r\n      on his afflicted friends. 74\r\n\r\n      73 (return) [ Pollio in Hist.

Zosimus, l. i. p.\r\n      51.]\r\n\r\n      Returning from the conquest of the East, Aurelian had already\r\n      crossed the Straits which divided Europe from Asia, when he was\r\n      provoked by the intelligence that the Palmyrenians had massacred\r\n      the governor and garrison which he had left among them, and again\r\n      erected the standard of revolt. Without a moment’s deliberation,\r\n      he once more turned his face towards Syria. Antioch was alarmed\r\n      by his rapid approach, and the helpless city of Palmyra felt the\r\n      irresistible weight of his resentment. We have a letter of\r\n      Aurelian himself, in which he acknowledges, 75 that old men,\r\n      women, children, and peasants, had been involved in that dreadful\r\n      execution, which should have been confined to armed rebellion;\r\n      and although his principal concern seems directed to the\r\n      reëstablishment of a temple of the Sun, he discovers some pity\r\n      for the remnant of the Palmyrenians, to whom he grants the\r\n      permission of rebuilding and inhabiting their city. But it is\r\n      easier to destroy than to restore. The seat of commerce, of arts,\r\n      and of Zenobia, gradually sunk into an obscure town, a trifling\r\n      fortress, and at length a miserable village. The present citizens\r\n      of Palmyra, consisting of thirty or forty families, have erected\r\n      their mud cottages within the spacious court of a magnificent\r\n      temple.\r\n\r\n      75 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 219.]\r\n\r\n      Another and a last labor still awaited the indefatigable\r\n      Aurelian; to suppress a dangerous though obscure rebel, who,\r\n      during the revolt of Palmyra, had arisen on the banks of the\r\n      Nile. Firmus, the friend and ally, as he proudly styled himself,\r\n      of Odenathus and Zenobia, was no more than a wealthy merchant of\r\n      Egypt. In the course of his trade to India, he had formed very\r\n      intimate connections with the Saracens and the Blemmyes, whose\r\n      situation on either coast of the Red Sea gave them an easy\r\n      introduction into the Upper Egypt. The Egyptians he inflamed with\r\n      the hope of freedom, and, at the head of their furious multitude,\r\n      broke into the city of Alexandria, where he assumed the Imperial\r\n      purple, coined money, published edicts, and raised an army,\r\n      which, as he vainly boasted, he was capable of maintaining from\r\n      the sole profits of his paper trade. Such troops were a feeble\r\n      defence against the approach of Aurelian; and it seems almost\r\n      unnecessary to relate, that Firmus was routed, taken, tortured,\r\n      and put to death. 76 Aurelian might now congratulate the senate,\r\n      the people, and himself, that in little more than three years, he\r\n      had restored universal peace and order to the Roman world.\r\n\r\n      76 (return) [ See Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 220, 242. As an\r\n      instance of luxury, it is observed, that he had glass windows. He\r\n      was remarkable for his strength and appetite, his courage and\r\n      dexterity. From the letter of Aurelian, we may justly infer, that\r\n      Firmus was the last of the rebels, and consequently that Tetricus\r\n      was already suppressed.]\r\n\r\n      Since the foundation of Rome, no general had more nobly deserved\r\n      a triumph than Aurelian; nor was a triumph ever celebrated with\r\n      superior pride and magnificence. 77 The pomp was opened by twenty\r\n      elephants, four royal tigers, and above two hundred of the most\r\n      curious animals from every climate of the North, the East, and\r\n      the South. They were followed by sixteen hundred gladiators,\r\n      devoted to the cruel amusement of the amphitheatre. The wealth of\r\n      Asia, the arms and ensigns of so many conquered nations, and the\r\n      magnificent plate and wardrobe of the Syrian queen, were disposed\r\n      in exact symmetry or artful disorder. The ambassadors of the most\r\n      remote parts of the earth, of Æthiopia, Arabia, Persia,\r\n      Bactriana, India, and China, all remarkable by their rich or\r\n      singular dresses, displayed the fame and power of the Roman\r\n      emperor, who exposed likewise to the public view the presents\r\n      that he had received, and particularly a great number of crowns\r\n      of gold, the offerings of grateful cities.\r\n\r\n      The victories of Aurelian were attested by the long train of\r\n      captives who reluctantly attended his triumph, Goths, Vandals,\r\n      Sarmatians, Alemanni, Franks, Gauls, Syrians, and Egyptians. Each\r\n      people was distinguished by its peculiar inscription, and the\r\n      title of Amazons was bestowed on ten martial heroines of the\r\n      Gothic nation who had been taken in arms. 78 But every eye,\r\n      disregarding the crowd of captives, was fixed on the emperor\r\n      Tetricus and the queen of the East. The former, as well as his\r\n      son, whom he had created Augustus, was dressed in Gallic\r\n      trousers, 79 a saffron tunic, and a robe of purple. The beauteous\r\n      figure of Zenobia was confined by fetters of gold; a slave\r\n      supported the gold chain which encircled her neck, and she almost\r\n      fainted under the intolerable weight of jewels. She preceded on\r\n      foot the magnificent chariot, in which she once hoped to enter\r\n      the gates of Rome. It was followed by two other chariots, still\r\n      more sumptuous, of Odenathus and of the Persian monarch. The\r\n      triumphal car of Aurelian (it had formerly been used by a Gothic\r\n      king) was drawn, on this memorable occasion, either by four stags\r\n      or by four elephants. 80 The most illustrious of the senate, the\r\n      people, and the army, closed the solemn procession. Unfeigned\r\n      joy, wonder, and gratitude, swelled the acclamations of the\r\n      multitude; but the satisfaction of the senate was clouded by the\r\n      appearance of Tetricus; nor could they suppress a rising murmur,\r\n      that the haughty emperor should thus expose to public ignominy\r\n      the person of a Roman and a magistrate. 81\r\n\r\n      77 (return) [ See the triumph of Aurelian, described by Vopiscus.\r\n      He relates the particulars with his usual minuteness; and, on\r\n      this occasion, they happen to be interesting.

These usurpers, whom their\r\n      defeat had convicted of the crime of treason, were permitted to\r\n      spend their lives in affluence and honorable repose.\r\n\r\n      The emperor presented Zenobia with an elegant villa at Tibur, or\r\n      Tivoli, about twenty miles from the capital; the Syrian queen\r\n      insensibly sunk into a Roman matron, her daughters married into\r\n      noble families, and her race was not yet extinct in the fifth\r\n      century. 82 Tetricus and his son were reinstated in their rank\r\n      and fortunes. They erected on the Cælian hill a magnificent\r\n      palace, and as soon as it was finished, invited Aurelian to\r\n      supper. On his entrance, he was agreeably surprised with a\r\n      picture which represented their singular history. They were\r\n      delineated offering to the emperor a civic crown and the sceptre\r\n      of Gaul, and again receiving at his hands the ornaments of the\r\n      senatorial dignity. The father was afterwards invested with the\r\n      government of Lucania, 83 and Aurelian, who soon admitted the\r\n      abdicated monarch to his friendship and conversation, familiarly\r\n      asked him, Whether it were not more desirable to administer a\r\n      province of Italy, than to reign beyond the Alps. The son long\r\n      continued a respectable member of the senate; nor was there any\r\n      one of the Roman nobility more esteemed by Aurelian, as well as\r\n      by his successors. 84\r\n\r\n      82 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist.

The\r\n      festival was protracted by theatrical representations, the games\r\n      of the circus, the hunting of wild beasts, combats of gladiators,\r\n      and naval engagements. Liberal donatives were distributed to the\r\n      army and people, and several institutions, agreeable or\r\n      beneficial to the city, contributed to perpetuate the glory of\r\n      Aurelian. A considerable portion of his oriental spoils was\r\n      consecrated to the gods of Rome; the Capitol, and every other\r\n      temple, glittered with the offerings of his ostentatious piety;\r\n      and the temple of the Sun alone received above fifteen thousand\r\n      pounds of gold. 85 This last was a magnificent structure, erected\r\n      by the emperor on the side of the Quirinal hill, and dedicated,\r\n      soon after the triumph, to that deity whom Aurelian adored as the\r\n      parent of his life and fortunes. His mother had been an inferior\r\n      priestess in a chapel of the Sun; a peculiar devotion to the god\r\n      of Light was a sentiment which the fortunate peasant imbibed in\r\n      his infancy; and every step of his elevation, every victory of\r\n      his reign, fortified superstition by gratitude. 86\r\n\r\n      85 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist.

Commentaire\r\n      de Spanheim, p. 109.]\r\n\r\n      The arms of Aurelian had vanquished the foreign and domestic foes\r\n      of the republic. We are assured, that, by his salutary rigor,\r\n      crimes and factions, mischievous arts and pernicious connivance,\r\n      the luxurious growth of a feeble and oppressive government, were\r\n      eradicated throughout the Roman world. 87 But if we attentively\r\n      reflect how much swifter is the progress of corruption than its\r\n      cure, and if we remember that the years abandoned to public\r\n      disorders exceeded the months allotted to the martial reign of\r\n      Aurelian, we must confess that a few short intervals of peace\r\n      were insufficient for the arduous work of reformation. Even his\r\n      attempt to restore the integrity of the coin was opposed by a\r\n      formidable insurrection. The emperor’s vexation breaks out in one\r\n      of his private letters. “Surely,” says he, “the gods have decreed\r\n      that my life should be a perpetual warfare. A sedition within the\r\n      walls has just now given birth to a very serious civil war. The\r\n      workmen of the mint, at the instigation of Felicissimus, a slave\r\n      to whom I had intrusted an employment in the finances, have risen\r\n      in rebellion. They are at length suppressed; but seven thousand\r\n      of my soldiers have been slain in the contest, of those troops\r\n      whose ordinary station is in Dacia, and the camps along the\r\n      Danube.” 88 Other writers, who confirm the same fact, add\r\n      likewise, that it happened soon after Aurelian’s triumph; that\r\n      the decisive engagement was fought on the Cælian hill; that the\r\n      workmen of the mint had adulterated the coin; and that the\r\n      emperor restored the public credit, by delivering out good money\r\n      in exchange for the bad, which the people was commanded to bring\r\n      into the treasury. 89\r\n\r\n      87 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist.

Eutropius, ix. 14. Aurel\r\n      Victor.]\r\n\r\n      We might content ourselves with relating this extraordinary\r\n      transaction, but we cannot dissemble how much in its present form\r\n      it appears to us inconsistent and incredible. The debasement of\r\n      the coin is indeed well suited to the administration of\r\n      Gallienus; nor is it unlikely that the instruments of the\r\n      corruption might dread the inflexible justice of Aurelian. But\r\n      the guilt, as well as the profit, must have been confined to a\r\n      very few; nor is it easy to conceive by what arts they could arm\r\n      a people whom they had injured, against a monarch whom they had\r\n      betrayed. We might naturally expect that such miscreants should\r\n      have shared the public detestation with the informers and the\r\n      other ministers of oppression; and that the reformation of the\r\n      coin should have been an action equally popular with the\r\n      destruction of those obsolete accounts, which by the emperor’s\r\n      order were burnt in the forum of Trajan. 90 In an age when the\r\n      principles of commerce were so imperfectly understood, the most\r\n      desirable end might perhaps be effected by harsh and injudicious\r\n      means; but a temporary grievance of such a nature can scarcely\r\n      excite and support a serious civil war. The repetition of\r\n      intolerable taxes, imposed either on the land or on the\r\n      necessaries of life, may at last provoke those who will not, or\r\n      who cannot, relinquish their country. But the case is far\r\n      otherwise in every operation which, by whatsoever expedients,\r\n      restores the just value of money. The transient evil is soon\r\n      obliterated by the permanent benefit, the loss is divided among\r\n      multitudes; and if a few wealthy individuals experience a\r\n      sensible diminution of treasure, with their riches, they at the\r\n      same time lose the degree of weight and importance which they\r\n      derived from the possession of them. However Aurelian might\r\n      choose to disguise the real cause of the insurrection, his\r\n      reformation of the coin could furnish only a faint pretence to a\r\n      party already powerful and discontented. Rome, though deprived of\r\n      freedom, was distracted by faction. The people, towards whom the\r\n      emperor, himself a plebeian, always expressed a peculiar\r\n      fondness, lived in perpetual dissension with the senate, the\r\n      equestrian order, and the Prætorian guards. 91 Nothing less than\r\n      the firm though secret conspiracy of those orders, of the\r\n      authority of the first, the wealth of the second, and the arms of\r\n      the third, could have displayed a strength capable of contending\r\n      in battle with the veteran legions of the Danube, which, under\r\n      the conduct of a martial sovereign, had achieved the conquest of\r\n      the West and of the East.\r\n\r\n      90 (return) [ Hist.

August.\r\n      p. 244.]\r\n\r\n      Whatever was the cause or the object of this rebellion, imputed\r\n      with so little probability to the workmen of the mint, Aurelian\r\n      used his victory with unrelenting rigor. 92 He was naturally of a\r\n      severe disposition. A peasant and a soldier, his nerves yielded\r\n      not easily to the impressions of sympathy, and he could sustain\r\n      without emotion the sight of tortures and death. Trained from his\r\n      earliest youth in the exercise of arms, he set too small a value\r\n      on the life of a citizen, chastised by military execution the\r\n      slightest offences, and transferred the stern discipline of the\r\n      camp into the civil administration of the laws. His love of\r\n      justice often became a blind and furious passion; and whenever he\r\n      deemed his own or the public safety endangered, he disregarded\r\n      the rules of evidence, and the proportion of punishments. The\r\n      unprovoked rebellion with which the Romans rewarded his services,\r\n      exasperated his haughty spirit. The noblest families of the\r\n      capital were involved in the guilt or suspicion of this dark\r\n      conspiracy. A nasty spirit of revenge urged the bloody\r\n      prosecution, and it proved fatal to one of the nephews of the\r\n      emperor. The executioners (if we may use the expression of a\r\n      contemporary poet) were fatigued, the prisons were crowded, and\r\n      the unhappy senate lamented the death or absence of its most\r\n      illustrious members. 93 Nor was the pride of Aurelian less\r\n      offensive to that assembly than his cruelty. Ignorant or\r\n      impatient of the restraints of civil institutions, he disdained\r\n      to hold his power by any other title than that of the sword, and\r\n      governed by right of conquest an empire which he had saved and\r\n      subdued. 94\r\n\r\n      92 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist.

It was expedient to exercise the\r\n      restless temper of the legions in some foreign war, and the\r\n      Persian monarch, exulting in the shame of Valerian, still braved\r\n      with impunity the offended majesty of Rome. At the head of an\r\n      army, less formidable by its numbers than by its discipline and\r\n      valor, the emperor advanced as far as the Straits which divide\r\n      Europe from Asia. He there experienced that the most absolute\r\n      power is a weak defence against the effects of despair. He had\r\n      threatened one of his secretaries who was accused of extortion;\r\n      and it was known that he seldom threatened in vain. The last hope\r\n      which remained for the criminal was to involve some of the\r\n      principal officers of the army in his danger, or at least in his\r\n      fears. Artfully counterfeiting his master’s hand, he showed them,\r\n      in a long and bloody list, their own names devoted to death.\r\n      Without suspecting or examining the fraud, they resolved to\r\n      secure their lives by the murder of the emperor. On his march,\r\n      between Byzantium and Heraclea, Aurelian was suddenly attacked by\r\n      the conspirators, whose stations gave them a right to surround\r\n      his person, and after a short resistance, fell by the hand of\r\n      Mucapor, a general whom he had always loved and trusted. He died\r\n      regretted by the army, detested by the senate, but universally\r\n      acknowledged as a warlike and fortunate prince, the useful,\r\n      though severe reformer of a degenerate state. 96\r\n\r\n      95 (return) [ It was the observation of Dioclatian.

A life of pleasure or virtue, of severity or mildness, of\r\n      indolence or glory, alike led to an untimely grave; and almost\r\n      every reign is closed by the same disgusting repetition of\r\n      treason and murder. The death of Aurelian, however, is remarkable\r\n      by its extraordinary consequences. The legions admired, lamented,\r\n      and revenged their victorious chief. The artifice of his\r\n      perfidious secretary was discovered and punished.\r\n\r\n      The deluded conspirators attended the funeral of their injured\r\n      sovereign, with sincere or well-feigned contrition, and submitted\r\n      to the unanimous resolution of the military order, which was\r\n      signified by the following epistle: “The brave and fortunate\r\n      armies to the senate and people of Rome.—The crime of one man,\r\n      and the error of many, have deprived us of the late emperor\r\n      Aurelian. May it please you, venerable lords and fathers! to\r\n      place him in the number of the gods, and to appoint a successor\r\n      whom your judgment shall declare worthy of the Imperial purple!\r\n      None of those whose guilt or misfortune have contributed to our\r\n      loss, shall ever reign over us.” 1 The Roman senators heard,\r\n      without surprise, that another emperor had been assassinated in\r\n      his camp; they secretly rejoiced in the fall of Aurelian; but the\r\n      modest and dutiful address of the legions, when it was\r\n      communicated in full assembly by the consul, diffused the most\r\n      pleasing astonishment. Such honors as fear and perhaps esteem\r\n      could extort, they liberally poured forth on the memory of their\r\n      deceased sovereign. Such acknowledgments as gratitude could\r\n      inspire, they returned to the faithful armies of the republic,\r\n      who entertained so just a sense of the legal authority of the\r\n      senate in the choice of an emperor. Yet, notwithstanding this\r\n      flattering appeal, the most prudent of the assembly declined\r\n      exposing their safety and dignity to the caprice of an armed\r\n      multitude. The strength of the legions was, indeed, a pledge of\r\n      their sincerity, since those who may command are seldom reduced\r\n      to the necessity of dissembling; but could it naturally be\r\n      expected, that a hasty repentance would correct the inveterate\r\n      habits of fourscore years? Should the soldiers relapse into their\r\n      accustomed seditions, their insolence might disgrace the majesty\r\n      of the senate, and prove fatal to the object of its choice.\r\n      Motives like these dictated a decree, by which the election of a\r\n      new emperor was referred to the suffrage of the military order.\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 222. Aurelius Victor\r\n      mentions a formal deputation from the troops to the senate.]\r\n\r\n      The contention that ensued is one of the best attested, but most\r\n      improbable events in the history of mankind. 2 The troops, as if\r\n      satiated with the exercise of power, again conjured the senate to\r\n      invest one of its own body with the Imperial purple. The senate\r\n      still persisted in its refusal; the army in its request. The\r\n      reciprocal offer was pressed and rejected at least three times,\r\n      and, whilst the obstinate modesty of either party was resolved to\r\n      receive a master from the hands of the other, eight months\r\n      insensibly elapsed; an amazing period of tranquil anarchy, during\r\n      which the Roman world remained without a sovereign, without a\r\n      usurper, and without a sedition. 201 The generals and magistrates\r\n      appointed by Aurelian continued to execute their ordinary\r\n      functions; and it is observed, that a proconsul of Asia was the\r\n      only considerable person removed from his office in the whole\r\n      course of the interregnum.\r\n\r\n      2 (return) [ Vopiscus, our principal authority, wrote at Rome,\r\n      sixteen years only after the death of Aurelian; and, besides the\r\n      recent notoriety of the facts, constantly draws his materials\r\n      from the Journals of the Senate, and the original papers of the\r\n      Ulpian library. Zosimus and Zonaras appear as ignorant of this\r\n      transaction as they were in general of the Roman constitution.]\r\n\r\n      201 (return) [ The interregnum could not be more than seven\r\n      months; Aurelian was assassinated in the middle of March, the\r\n      year of Rome 1028. Tacitus was elected the 25th September in the\r\n      same year.—G.]\r\n\r\n      An event somewhat similar, but much less authentic, is supposed\r\n      to have happened after the death of Romulus, who, in his life and\r\n      character, bore some affinity with Aurelian. The throne was\r\n      vacant during twelve months, till the election of a Sabine\r\n      philosopher, and the public peace was guarded in the same manner,\r\n      by the union of the several orders of the state. But, in the time\r\n      of Numa and Romulus, the arms of the people were controlled by\r\n      the authority of the Patricians; and the balance of freedom was\r\n      easily preserved in a small and virtuous community. 3 The decline\r\n      of the Roman state, far different from its infancy, was attended\r\n      with every circumstance that could banish from an interregnum the\r\n      prospect of obedience and harmony: an immense and tumultuous\r\n      capital, a wide extent of empire, the servile equality of\r\n      despotism, an army of four hundred thousand mercenaries, and the\r\n      experience of frequent revolutions. Yet, notwithstanding all\r\n      these temptations, the discipline and memory of Aurelian still\r\n      restrained the seditious temper of the troops, as well as the\r\n      fatal ambition of their leaders. The flower of the legions\r\n      maintained their stations on the banks of the Bosphorus, and the\r\n      Imperial standard awed the less powerful camps of Rome and of the\r\n      provinces. A generous though transient enthusiasm seemed to\r\n      animate the military order; and we may hope that a few real\r\n      patriots cultivated the returning friendship of the army and the\r\n      senate as the only expedient capable of restoring the republic to\r\n      its ancient beauty and vigor.\r\n\r\n      3 (return) [ Liv. i. 17 Dionys. Halicarn. l. ii. p. 115. Plutarch\r\n      in Numa, p. 60. The first of these writers relates the story like\r\n      an orator, the second like a lawyer, and the third like a\r\n      moralist, and none of them probably without some intermixture of\r\n      fable.]\r\n\r\n      On the twenty-fifth of September, near eight months after the\r\n      murder of Aurelian, the consul convoked an assembly of the\r\n      senate, and reported the doubtful and dangerous situation of the\r\n      empire. He slightly insinuated, that the precarious loyalty of\r\n      the soldiers depended on the chance of every hour, and of every\r\n      accident; but he represented, with the most convincing eloquence,\r\n      the various dangers that might attend any further delay in the\r\n      choice of an emperor. Intelligence, he said, was already\r\n      received, that the Germans had passed the Rhine, and occupied\r\n      some of the strongest and most opulent cities of Gaul. The\r\n      ambition of the Persian king kept the East in perpetual alarms;\r\n      Egypt, Africa, and Illyricum, were exposed to foreign and\r\n      domestic arms, and the levity of Syria would prefer even a female\r\n      sceptre to the sanctity of the Roman laws. The consul, then\r\n      addressing himself to Tacitus, the first of the senators, 4\r\n      required his opinion on the important subject of a proper\r\n      candidate for the vacant throne.\r\n\r\n      4 (return) [ Vopiscus (in Hist. August p. 227) calls him “primæ\r\n      sententia consularis;” and soon afterwards Princeps senatus. It\r\n      is natural to suppose, that the monarchs of Rome, disdaining that\r\n      humble title, resigned it to the most ancient of the senators.]\r\n\r\n      If we can prefer personal merit to accidental greatness, we shall\r\n      esteem the birth of Tacitus more truly noble than that of kings.\r\n      He claimed his descent from the philosophic historian whose\r\n      writings will instruct the last generations of mankind. 5 The\r\n      senator Tacitus was then seventy-five years of age. 6 The long\r\n      period of his innocent life was adorned with wealth and honors.\r\n      He had twice been invested with the consular dignity, 7 and\r\n      enjoyed with elegance and sobriety his ample patrimony of between\r\n      two and three millions sterling. 8 The experience of so many\r\n      princes, whom he had esteemed or endured, from the vain follies\r\n      of Elagabalus to the useful rigor of Aurelian, taught him to form\r\n      a just estimate of the duties, the dangers, and the temptations\r\n      of their sublime station. From the assiduous study of his\r\n      immortal ancestor, he derived the knowledge of the Roman\r\n      constitution, and of human nature. 9 The voice of the people had\r\n      already named Tacitus as the citizen the most worthy of empire.\r\n      The ungrateful rumor reached his ears, and induced him to seek\r\n      the retirement of one of his villas in Campania. He had passed\r\n      two months in the delightful privacy of Baiæ, when he reluctantly\r\n      obeyed the summons of the consul to resume his honorable place in\r\n      the senate, and to assist the republic with his counsels on this\r\n      important occasion.\r\n\r\n      5 (return) [ The only objection to this genealogy is, that the\r\n      historian was named Cornelius, the emperor, Claudius. But under\r\n      the lower empire, surnames were extremely various and uncertain.]\r\n\r\n      6 (return) [ Zonaras, l. xii. p. 637. The Alexandrian Chronicle,\r\n      by an obvious mistake, transfers that age to Aurelian.]\r\n\r\n      7 (return) [ In the year 273, he was ordinary consul. But he must\r\n      have been Suffectus many years before, and most probably under\r\n      Valerian.]\r\n\r\n      8 (return) [ Bis millies octingenties. Vopiscus in Hist. August\r\n      p. 229. This sum, according to the old standard, was equivalent\r\n      to eight hundred and forty thousand Roman pounds of silver, each\r\n      of the value of three pounds sterling. But in the age of Tacitus,\r\n      the coin had lost much of its weight and purity.]\r\n\r\n      9 (return) [ After his accession, he gave orders that ten copies\r\n      of the historian should be annually transcribed and placed in the\r\n      public libraries. The Roman libraries have long since perished,\r\n      and the most valuable part of Tacitus was preserved in a single\r\n      Ms., and discovered in a monastery of Westphalia. See Bayle,\r\n      Dictionnaire, Art. Tacite, and Lipsius ad Annal. ii. 9.]\r\n\r\n      He arose to speak, when from every quarter of the house, he was\r\n      saluted with the names of Augustus and emperor. “Tacitus\r\n      Augustus, the gods preserve thee! we choose thee for our\r\n      sovereign; to thy care we intrust the republic and the world.\r\n      Accept the empire from the authority of the senate. It is due to\r\n      thy rank, to thy conduct, to thy manners.” As soon as the tumult\r\n      of acclamations subsided, Tacitus attempted to decline the\r\n      dangerous honor, and to express his wonder, that they should\r\n      elect his age and infirmities to succeed the martial vigor of\r\n      Aurelian. “Are these limbs, conscript fathers! fitted to sustain\r\n      the weight of armor, or to practise the exercises of the camp?\r\n      The variety of climates, and the hardships of a military life,\r\n      would soon oppress a feeble constitution, which subsists only by\r\n      the most tender management. My exhausted strength scarcely\r\n      enables me to discharge the duty of a senator; how insufficient\r\n      would it prove to the arduous labors of war and government! Can\r\n      you hope, that the legions will respect a weak old man, whose\r\n      days have been spent in the shade of peace and retirement? Can\r\n      you desire that I should ever find reason to regret the favorable\r\n      opinion of the senate?” 10\r\n\r\n      10 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 227.]\r\n\r\n      The reluctance of Tacitus (and it might possibly be sincere) was\r\n      encountered by the affectionate obstinacy of the senate. Five\r\n      hundred voices repeated at once, in eloquent confusion, that the\r\n      greatest of the Roman princes, Numa, Trajan, Hadrian, and the\r\n      Antonines, had ascended the throne in a very advanced season of\r\n      life; that the mind, not the body, a sovereign, not a soldier,\r\n      was the object of their choice; and that they expected from him\r\n      no more than to guide by his wisdom the valor of the legions.\r\n      These pressing though tumultuary instances were seconded by a\r\n      more regular oration of Metius Falconius, the next on the\r\n      consular bench to Tacitus himself. He reminded the assembly of\r\n      the evils which Rome had endured from the vices of headstrong and\r\n      capricious youths, congratulated them on the election of a\r\n      virtuous and experienced senator, and, with a manly, though\r\n      perhaps a selfish, freedom, exhorted Tacitus to remember the\r\n      reasons of his elevation, and to seek a successor, not in his own\r\n      family, but in the republic. The speech of Falconius was enforced\r\n      by a general acclamation. The emperor elect submitted to the\r\n      authority of his country, and received the voluntary homage of\r\n      his equals. The judgment of the senate was confirmed by the\r\n      consent of the Roman people and of the Prætorian guards. 11\r\n\r\n      11 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 228. Tacitus addressed the\r\n      Prætorians by the appellation of sanctissimi milites, and the\r\n      people by that of sacratissim. Quirites.]\r\n\r\n      The administration of Tacitus was not unworthy of his life and\r\n      principles. A grateful servant of the senate, he considered that\r\n      national council as the author, and himself as the subject, of\r\n      the laws. 12 He studied to heal the wounds which Imperial pride,\r\n      civil discord, and military violence, had inflicted on the\r\n      constitution, and to restore, at least, the image of the ancient\r\n      republic, as it had been preserved by the policy of Augustus, and\r\n      the virtues of Trajan and the Antonines. It may not be useless to\r\n      recapitulate some of the most important prerogatives which the\r\n      senate appeared to have regained by the election of Tacitus. 13\r\n      1. To invest one of their body, under the title of emperor, with\r\n      the general command of the armies, and the government of the\r\n      frontier provinces. 2. To determine the list, or, as it was then\r\n      styled, the College of Consuls. They were twelve in number, who,\r\n      in successive pairs, each, during the space of two months, filled\r\n      the year, and represented the dignity of that ancient office. The\r\n      authority of the senate, in the nomination of the consuls, was\r\n      exercised with such independent freedom, that no regard was paid\r\n      to an irregular request of the emperor in favor of his brother\r\n      Florianus. “The senate,” exclaimed Tacitus, with the honest\r\n      transport of a patriot, “understand the character of a prince\r\n      whom they have chosen.” 3. To appoint the proconsuls and\r\n      presidents of the provinces, and to confer on all the magistrates\r\n      their civil jurisdiction. 4. To receive appeals through the\r\n      intermediate office of the præfect of the city from all the\r\n      tribunals of the empire. 5. To give force and validity, by their\r\n      decrees, to such as they should approve of the emperor’s edicts.\r\n      6. To these several branches of authority we may add some\r\n      inspection over the finances, since, even in the stern reign of\r\n      Aurelian, it was in their power to divert a part of the revenue\r\n      from the public service. 14\r\n\r\n      12 (return) [ In his manumissions he never exceeded the number of\r\n      a hundred, as limited by the Caninian law, which was enacted\r\n      under Augustus, and at length repealed by Justinian.

August. p. 216. The passage is\r\n      perfectly clear, both Casaubon and Salmasius wish to correct it.]\r\n\r\n      Circular epistles were sent, without delay, to all the principal\r\n      cities of the empire, Treves, Milan, Aquileia, Thessalonica,\r\n      Corinth, Athens, Antioch, Alexandria, and Carthage, to claim\r\n      their obedience, and to inform them of the happy revolution,\r\n      which had restored the Roman senate to its ancient dignity. Two\r\n      of these epistles are still extant. We likewise possess two very\r\n      singular fragments of the private correspondence of the senators\r\n      on this occasion. They discover the most excessive joy, and the\r\n      most unbounded hopes. “Cast away your indolence,” it is thus that\r\n      one of the senators addresses his friend, “emerge from your\r\n      retirements of Baiæ and Puteoli. Give yourself to the city, to\r\n      the senate. Rome flourishes, the whole republic flourishes.\r\n      Thanks to the Roman army, to an army truly Roman; at length we\r\n      have recovered our just authority, the end of all our desires. We\r\n      hear appeals, we appoint proconsuls, we create emperors; perhaps\r\n      too we may restrain them—to the wise a word is sufficient.” 15\r\n      These lofty expectations were, however, soon disappointed; nor,\r\n      indeed, was it possible that the armies and the provinces should\r\n      long obey the luxurious and unwarlike nobles of Rome. On the\r\n      slightest touch, the unsupported fabric of their pride and power\r\n      fell to the ground. The expiring senate displayed a sudden\r\n      lustre, blazed for a moment, and was extinguished forever.\r\n\r\n      15 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 230, 232, 233. The\r\n      senators celebrated the happy restoration with hecatombs and\r\n      public rejoicings.]\r\n\r\n      All that had yet passed at Rome was no more than a theatrical\r\n      representation, unless it was ratified by the more substantial\r\n      power of the legions. Leaving the senators to enjoy their dream\r\n      of freedom and ambition, Tacitus proceeded to the Thracian camp,\r\n      and was there, by the Prætorian præfect, presented to the\r\n      assembled troops, as the prince whom they themselves had\r\n      demanded, and whom the senate had bestowed. As soon as the\r\n      præfect was silent, the emperor addressed himself to the soldiers\r\n      with eloquence and propriety. He gratified their avarice by a\r\n      liberal distribution of treasure, under the names of pay and\r\n      donative. He engaged their esteem by a spirited declaration, that\r\n      although his age might disable him from the performance of\r\n      military exploits, his counsels should never be unworthy of a\r\n      Roman general, the successor of the brave Aurelian. 16\r\n\r\n      16 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 228.]\r\n\r\n      Whilst the deceased emperor was making preparations for a second\r\n      expedition into the East, he had negotiated with the Alani, 161 a\r\n      Scythian people, who pitched their tents in the neighborhood of\r\n      the Lake Mæotis. Those barbarians, allured by presents and\r\n      subsidies, had promised to invade Persia with a numerous body of\r\n      light cavalry. They were faithful to their engagements; but when\r\n      they arrived on the Roman frontier, Aurelian was already dead,\r\n      the design of the Persian war was at least suspended, and the\r\n      generals, who, during the interregnum, exercised a doubtful\r\n      authority, were unprepared either to receive or to oppose them.\r\n      Provoked by such treatment, which they considered as trifling and\r\n      perfidious, the Alani had recourse to their own valor for their\r\n      payment and revenge; and as they moved with the usual swiftness\r\n      of Tartars, they had soon spread themselves over the provinces of\r\n      Pontus, Cappadocia, Cilicia, and Galatia. The legions, who from\r\n      the opposite shores of the Bosphorus could almost distinguish the\r\n      flames of the cities and villages, impatiently urged their\r\n      general to lead them against the invaders. The conduct of Tacitus\r\n      was suitable to his age and station. He convinced the barbarians\r\n      of the faith, as well as the power, of the empire. Great numbers\r\n      of the Alani, appeased by the punctual discharge of the\r\n      engagements which Aurelian had contracted with them, relinquished\r\n      their booty and captives, and quietly retreated to their own\r\n      deserts, beyond the Phasis. Against the remainder, who refused\r\n      peace, the Roman emperor waged, in person, a successful war.\r\n      Seconded by an army of brave and experienced veterans, in a few\r\n      weeks he delivered the provinces of Asia from the terror of the\r\n      Scythian invasion. 17\r\n\r\n      161 (return) [ On the Alani, see ch. xxvi. note 55.—M.]\r\n\r\n      17 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist.

Two passages in the life of Probus\r\n      (p. 236, 238) convince me, that these Scythian invaders of Pontus\r\n      were Alani. If we may believe Zosimus, (l. i. p. 58,) Florianus\r\n      pursued them as far as the Cimmerian Bosphorus. But he had\r\n      scarcely time for so long and difficult an expedition.]\r\n\r\n      But the glory and life of Tacitus were of short duration.\r\n      Transported, in the depth of winter, from the soft retirement of\r\n      Campania to the foot of Mount Caucasus, he sunk under the\r\n      unaccustomed hardships of a military life. The fatigues of the\r\n      body were aggravated by the cares of the mind. For a while, the\r\n      angry and selfish passions of the soldiers had been suspended by\r\n      the enthusiasm of public virtue. They soon broke out with\r\n      redoubled violence, and raged in the camp, and even in the tent\r\n      of the aged emperor. His mild and amiable character served only\r\n      to inspire contempt, and he was incessantly tormented with\r\n      factions which he could not assuage, and by demands which it was\r\n      impossible to satisfy. Whatever flattering expectations he had\r\n      conceived of reconciling the public disorders, Tacitus soon was\r\n      convinced that the licentiousness of the army disdained the\r\n      feeble restraint of laws, and his last hour was hastened by\r\n      anguish and disappointment. It may be doubtful whether the\r\n      soldiers imbrued their hands in the blood of this innocent\r\n      prince. 18 It is certain that their insolence was the cause of\r\n      his death. He expired at Tyana in Cappadocia, after a reign of\r\n      only six months and about twenty days. 19\r\n\r\n      18 (return) [ Eutropius and Aurelius Victor only say that he\r\n      died; Victor Junior adds, that it was of a fever. Zosimus and\r\n      Zonaras affirm, that he was killed by the soldiers. Vopiscus\r\n      mentions both accounts, and seems to hesitate. Yet surely these\r\n      jarring opinions are easily reconciled.]\r\n\r\n      19 (return) [ According to the two Victors, he reigned exactly\r\n      two hundred days.]\r\n\r\n      The eyes of Tacitus were scarcely closed, before his brother\r\n      Florianus showed himself unworthy to reign, by the hasty\r\n      usurpation of the purple, without expecting the approbation of\r\n      the senate. The reverence for the Roman constitution, which yet\r\n      influenced the camp and the provinces, was sufficiently strong to\r\n      dispose them to censure, but not to provoke them to oppose, the\r\n      precipitate ambition of Florianus. The discontent would have\r\n      evaporated in idle murmurs, had not the general of the East, the\r\n      heroic Probus, boldly declared himself the avenger of the senate.\r\n\r\n      The contest, however, was still unequal; nor could the most able\r\n      leader, at the head of the effeminate troops of Egypt and Syria,\r\n      encounter, with any hopes of victory, the legions of Europe,\r\n      whose irresistible strength appeared to support the brother of\r\n      Tacitus. But the fortune and activity of Probus triumphed over\r\n      every obstacle. The hardy veterans of his rival, accustomed to\r\n      cold climates, sickened and consumed away in the sultry heats of\r\n      Cilicia, where the summer proved remarkably unwholesome. Their\r\n      numbers were diminished by frequent desertion; the passes of the\r\n      mountains were feebly defended; Tarsus opened its gates; and the\r\n      soldiers of Florianus, when they had permitted him to enjoy the\r\n      Imperial title about three months, delivered the empire from\r\n      civil war by the easy sacrifice of a prince whom they despised.\r\n      20\r\n\r\n      20 (return) [ Hist. August, p. 231. Zosimus, l. i. p. 58, 59.\r\n      Zonaras, l. xii. p. 637. Aurelius Victor says, that Probus\r\n      assumed the empire in Illyricum; an opinion which (though adopted\r\n      by a very learned man) would throw that period of history into\r\n      inextricable confusion.]\r\n\r\n      The perpetual revolutions of the throne had so perfectly erased\r\n      every notion of hereditary title, that the family of an\r\n      unfortunate emperor was incapable of exciting the jealousy of his\r\n      successors. The children of Tacitus and Florianus were permitted\r\n      to descend into a private station, and to mingle with the general\r\n      mass of the people. Their poverty indeed became an additional\r\n      safeguard to their innocence. When Tacitus was elected by the\r\n      senate, he resigned his ample patrimony to the public service; 21\r\n      an act of generosity specious in appearance, but which evidently\r\n      disclosed his intention of transmitting the empire to his\r\n      descendants. The only consolation of their fallen state was the\r\n      remembrance of transient greatness, and a distant hope, the child\r\n      of a flattering prophecy, that at the end of a thousand years, a\r\n      monarch of the race of Tacitus should arise, the protector of the\r\n      senate, the restorer of Rome, and the conqueror of the whole\r\n      earth. 22\r\n\r\n      21 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 229]\r\n\r\n      22 (return) [ He was to send judges to the Parthians, Persians,\r\n      and Sarmatians, a president to Taprobani, and a proconsul to the\r\n      Roman island, (supposed by Casaubon and Salmasius to mean\r\n      Britain.) Such a history as mine (says Vopiscus with proper\r\n      modesty) will not subsist a thousand years, to expose or justify\r\n      the prediction.]\r\n\r\n      The peasants of Illyricum, who had already given Claudius and\r\n      Aurelian to the sinking empire, had an equal right to glory in\r\n      the elevation of Probus. 23 Above twenty years before, the\r\n      emperor Valerian, with his usual penetration, had discovered the\r\n      rising merit of the young soldier, on whom he conferred the rank\r\n      of tribune, long before the age prescribed by the military\r\n      regulations. The tribune soon justified his choice, by a victory\r\n      over a great body of Sarmatians, in which he saved the life of a\r\n      near relation of Valerian; and deserved to receive from the\r\n      emperor’s hand the collars, bracelets, spears, and banners, the\r\n      mural and the civic crown, and all the honorable rewards reserved\r\n      by ancient Rome for successful valor. The third, and afterwards\r\n      the tenth, legion were intrusted to the command of Probus, who,\r\n      in every step of his promotion, showed himself superior to the\r\n      station which he filled. Africa and Pontus, the Rhine, the\r\n      Danube, the Euphrates, and the Nile, by turns afforded him the\r\n      most splendid occasions of displaying his personal prowess and\r\n      his conduct in war. Aurelian was indebted for the honest courage\r\n      with which he often checked the cruelty of his master. Tacitus,\r\n      who desired by the abilities of his generals to supply his own\r\n      deficiency of military talents, named him commander-in-chief of\r\n      all the eastern provinces, with five times the usual salary, the\r\n      promise of the consulship, and the hope of a triumph. When Probus\r\n      ascended the Imperial throne, he was about forty-four years of\r\n      age; 24 in the full possession of his fame, of the love of the\r\n      army, and of a mature vigor of mind and body.\r\n\r\n      23 (return) [ For the private life of Probus, see Vopiscus in\r\n      Hist. August p. 234—237]\r\n\r\n      24 (return) [ According to the Alexandrian chronicle, he was\r\n      fifty at the time of his death.]\r\n\r\n      His acknowledged merit, and the success of his arms against\r\n      Florianus, left him without an enemy or a competitor. Yet, if we\r\n      may credit his own professions, very far from being desirous of\r\n      the empire, he had accepted it with the most sincere reluctance.\r\n      “But it is no longer in my power,” says Probus, in a private\r\n      letter, “to lay down a title so full of envy and of danger. I\r\n      must continue to personate the character which the soldiers have\r\n      imposed upon me.” 25 His dutiful address to the senate displayed\r\n      the sentiments, or at least the language, of a Roman patriot:\r\n      “When you elected one of your order, conscript fathers! to\r\n      succeed the emperor Aurelian, you acted in a manner suitable to\r\n      your justice and wisdom. For you are the legal sovereigns of the\r\n      world, and the power which you derive from your ancestors will\r\n      descend to your posterity. Happy would it have been, if\r\n      Florianus, instead of usurping the purple of his brother, like a\r\n      private inheritance, had expected what your majesty might\r\n      determine, either in his favor, or in that of any other person.\r\n      The prudent soldiers have punished his rashness. To me they have\r\n      offered the title of Augustus. But I submit to your clemency my\r\n      pretensions and my merits.” 26 When this respectful epistle was\r\n      read by the consul, the senators were unable to disguise their\r\n      satisfaction, that Probus should condescend thus numbly to\r\n      solicit a sceptre which he already possessed. They celebrated\r\n      with the warmest gratitude his virtues, his exploits, and above\r\n      all his moderation. A decree immediately passed, without a\r\n      dissenting voice, to ratify the election of the eastern armies,\r\n      and to confer on their chief all the several branches of the\r\n      Imperial dignity: the names of Cæsar and Augustus, the title of\r\n      Father of his country, the right of making in the same day three\r\n      motions in the senate, 27 the office of Pontifex Maximus, the\r\n      tribunitian power, and the proconsular command; a mode of\r\n      investiture, which, though it seemed to multiply the authority of\r\n      the emperor, expressed the constitution of the ancient republic.\r\n      The reign of Probus corresponded with this fair beginning. The\r\n      senate was permitted to direct the civil administration of the\r\n      empire. Their faithful general asserted the honor of the Roman\r\n      arms, and often laid at their feet crowns of gold and barbaric\r\n      trophies, the fruits of his numerous victories. 28 Yet, whilst he\r\n      gratified their vanity, he must secretly have despised their\r\n      indolence and weakness. Though it was every moment in their power\r\n      to repeal the disgraceful edict of Gallienus, the proud\r\n      successors of the Scipios patiently acquiesced in their exclusion\r\n      from all military employments. They soon experienced, that those\r\n      who refuse the sword must renounce the sceptre.\r\n\r\n      25 (return) [ This letter was addressed to the Prætorian præfect,\r\n      whom (on condition of his good behavior) he promised to continue\r\n      in his great office.

After his death they seemed to revive with an increase of\r\n      fury and of numbers. They were again vanquished by the active\r\n      vigor of Probus, who, in a short reign of about six years, 29\r\n      equalled the fame of ancient heroes, and restored peace and order\r\n      to every province of the Roman world. The dangerous frontier of\r\n      Rhætia he so firmly secured, that he left it without the\r\n      suspicion of an enemy. He broke the wandering power of the\r\n      Sarmatian tribes, and by the terror of his arms compelled those\r\n      barbarians to relinquish their spoil. The Gothic nation courted\r\n      the alliance of so warlike an emperor. 30 He attacked the\r\n      Isaurians in their mountains, besieged and took several of their\r\n      strongest castles, 31 and flattered himself that he had forever\r\n      suppressed a domestic foe, whose independence so deeply wounded\r\n      the majesty of the empire. The troubles excited by the usurper\r\n      Firmus in the Upper Egypt had never been perfectly appeased, and\r\n      the cities of Ptolemais and Coptos, fortified by the alliance of\r\n      the Blemmyes, still maintained an obscure rebellion. The\r\n      chastisement of those cities, and of their auxiliaries the\r\n      savages of the South, is said to have alarmed the court of\r\n      Persia, 32 and the Great King sued in vain for the friendship of\r\n      Probus. Most of the exploits which distinguished his reign were\r\n      achieved by the personal valor and conduct of the emperor,\r\n      insomuch that the writer of his life expresses some amazement\r\n      how, in so short a time, a single man could be present in so many\r\n      distant wars. The remaining actions he intrusted to the care of\r\n      his lieutenants, the judicious choice of whom forms no\r\n      inconsiderable part of his glory. Carus, Diocletian, Maximian,\r\n      Constantius, Galerius, Asclepiodatus, Annibalianus, and a crowd\r\n      of other chiefs, who afterwards ascended or supported the throne,\r\n      were trained to arms in the severe school of Aurelian and Probus.\r\n      33\r\n\r\n      29 (return) [ The date and duration of the reign of Probus are\r\n      very correctly ascertained by Cardinal Noris in his learned work,\r\n      De Epochis Syro-Macedonum, p. 96—105.

He drove back the Franks into their morasses; a\r\n      descriptive circumstance from whence we may infer, that the\r\n      confederacy known by the manly appellation of _Free_, already\r\n      occupied the flat maritime country, intersected and almost\r\n      overflown by the stagnating waters of the Rhine, and that several\r\n      tribes of the Frisians and Batavians had acceded to their\r\n      alliance. He vanquished the Burgundians, a considerable people of\r\n      the Vandalic race. 341 They had wandered in quest of booty from\r\n      the banks of the Oder to those of the Seine. They esteemed\r\n      themselves sufficiently fortunate to purchase, by the restitution\r\n      of all their booty, the permission of an undisturbed retreat.\r\n      They attempted to elude that article of the treaty. Their\r\n      punishment was immediate and terrible. 35 But of all the invaders\r\n      of Gaul, the most formidable were the Lygians, a distant people,\r\n      who reigned over a wide domain on the frontiers of Poland and\r\n      Silesia. 36 In the Lygian nation, the Arii held the first rank by\r\n      their numbers and fierceness. “The Arii” (it is thus that they\r\n      are described by the energy of Tacitus) “study to improve by art\r\n      and circumstances the innate terrors of their barbarism. Their\r\n      shields are black, their bodies are painted black. They choose\r\n      for the combat the darkest hour of the night. Their host\r\n      advances, covered as it were with a funeral shade; 37 nor do they\r\n      often find an enemy capable of sustaining so strange and infernal\r\n      an aspect. Of all our senses, the eyes are the first vanquished\r\n      in battle.” 38 Yet the arms and discipline of the Romans easily\r\n      discomfited these horrid phantoms. The Lygii were defeated in a\r\n      general engagement, and Semno, the most renowned of their chiefs,\r\n      fell alive into the hands of Probus. That prudent emperor,\r\n      unwilling to reduce a brave people to despair, granted them an\r\n      honorable capitulation, and permitted them to return in safety to\r\n      their native country. But the losses which they suffered in the\r\n      march, the battle, and the retreat, broke the power of the\r\n      nation: nor is the Lygian name ever repeated in the history\r\n      either of Germany or of the empire. The deliverance of Gaul is\r\n      reported to have cost the lives of four hundred thousand of the\r\n      invaders; a work of labor to the Romans, and of expense to the\r\n      emperor, who gave a piece of gold for the head of every\r\n      barbarian. 39 But as the fame of warriors is built on the\r\n      destruction of human kind, we may naturally suspect that the\r\n      sanguinary account was multiplied by the avarice of the soldiers,\r\n      and accepted without any very severe examination by the liberal\r\n      vanity of Probus.\r\n\r\n      34 (return) [ See the Cæsars of Julian, and Hist.

The more\r\n      daring Probus pursued his Gallic victories, passed the Rhine, and\r\n      displayed his invincible eagles on the banks of the Elbe and the\r\n      Neckar. He was fully convinced that nothing could reconcile the\r\n      minds of the barbarians to peace, unless they experienced, in\r\n      their own country, the calamities of war. Germany, exhausted by\r\n      the ill success of the last emigration, was astonished by his\r\n      presence. Nine of the most considerable princes repaired to his\r\n      camp, and fell prostrate at his feet. Such a treaty was humbly\r\n      received by the Germans, as it pleased the conqueror to dictate.\r\n      He exacted a strict restitution of the effects and captives which\r\n      they had carried away from the provinces; and obliged their own\r\n      magistrates to punish the more obstinate robbers who presumed to\r\n      detain any part of the spoil. A considerable tribute of corn,\r\n      cattle, and horses, the only wealth of barbarians, was reserved\r\n      for the use of the garrisons which Probus established on the\r\n      limits of their territory. He even entertained some thoughts of\r\n      compelling the Germans to relinquish the exercise of arms, and to\r\n      trust their differences to the justice, their safety to the\r\n      power, of Rome. To accomplish these salutary ends, the constant\r\n      residence of an Imperial governor, supported by a numerous army,\r\n      was indispensably requisite. Probus therefore judged it more\r\n      expedient to defer the execution of so great a design; which was\r\n      indeed rather of specious than solid utility. 40 Had Germany been\r\n      reduced into the state of a province, the Romans, with immense\r\n      labor and expense, would have acquired only a more extensive\r\n      boundary to defend against the fiercer and more active barbarians\r\n      of Scythia.\r\n\r\n      40 (return) [ Hist. August. 238, 239. Vopiscus quotes a letter\r\n      from the emperor to the senate, in which he mentions his design\r\n      of reducing Germany into a province.]\r\n\r\n      Instead of reducing the warlike natives of Germany to the\r\n      condition of subjects, Probus contented himself with the humble\r\n      expedient of raising a bulwark against their inroads. The country\r\n      which now forms the circle of Swabia had been left desert in the\r\n      age of Augustus by the emigration of its ancient inhabitants. 41\r\n      The fertility of the soil soon attracted a new colony from the\r\n      adjacent provinces of Gaul. Crowds of adventurers, of a roving\r\n      temper and of desperate fortunes, occupied the doubtful\r\n      possession, and acknowledged, by the payment of tithes, the\r\n      majesty of the empire. 42 To protect these new subjects, a line\r\n      of frontier garrisons was gradually extended from the Rhine to\r\n      the Danube. About the reign of Hadrian, when that mode of defence\r\n      began to be practised, these garrisons were connected and covered\r\n      by a strong intrenchment of trees and palisades. In the place of\r\n      so rude a bulwark, the emperor Probus constructed a stone wall of\r\n      a considerable height, and strengthened it by towers at\r\n      convenient distances. From the neighborhood of Neustadt and\r\n      Ratisbon on the Danube, it stretched across hills, valleys,\r\n      rivers, and morasses, as far as Wimpfen on the Neckar, and at\r\n      length terminated on the banks of the Rhine, after a winding\r\n      course of near two hundred miles. 43 This important barrier,\r\n      uniting the two mighty streams that protected the provinces of\r\n      Europe, seemed to fill up the vacant space through which the\r\n      barbarians, and particularly the Alemanni, could penetrate with\r\n      the greatest facility into the heart of the empire. But the\r\n      experience of the world, from China to Britain, has exposed the\r\n      vain attempt of fortifying any extensive tract of country. 44 An\r\n      active enemy, who can select and vary his points of attack, must,\r\n      in the end, discover some feeble spot, or some unguarded moment.\r\n      The strength, as well as the attention, of the defenders is\r\n      divided; and such are the blind effects of terror on the firmest\r\n      troops, that a line broken in a single place is almost instantly\r\n      deserted. The fate of the wall which Probus erected may confirm\r\n      the general observation. Within a few years after his death, it\r\n      was overthrown by the Alemanni. Its scattered ruins, universally\r\n      ascribed to the power of the Dæmon, now serve only to excite the\r\n      wonder of the Swabian peasant.\r\n\r\n      41 (return) [ Strabo, l. vii.

The emperor dispersed them through\r\n      all the provinces, and distributed this dangerous reënforcement,\r\n      in small bands of fifty or sixty each, among the national troops;\r\n      judiciously observing, that the aid which the republic derived\r\n      from the barbarians should be felt but not seen. 45 Their aid was\r\n      now become necessary. The feeble elegance of Italy and the\r\n      internal provinces could no longer support the weight of arms.\r\n      The hardy frontiers of the Rhine and Danube still produced minds\r\n      and bodies equal to the labors of the camp; but a perpetual\r\n      series of wars had gradually diminished their numbers. The\r\n      infrequency of marriage, and the ruin of agriculture, affected\r\n      the principles of population, and not only destroyed the strength\r\n      of the present, but intercepted the hope of future, generations.\r\n      The wisdom of Probus embraced a great and beneficial plan of\r\n      replenishing the exhausted frontiers, by new colonies of captive\r\n      or fugitive barbarians, on whom he bestowed lands, cattle,\r\n      instruments of husbandry, and every encouragement that might\r\n      engage them to educate a race of soldiers for the service of the\r\n      republic. Into Britain, and most probably into Cambridgeshire, 46\r\n      he transported a considerable body of Vandals. The impossibility\r\n      of an escape reconciled them to their situation, and in the\r\n      subsequent troubles of that island, they approved themselves the\r\n      most faithful servants of the state. 47 Great numbers of Franks\r\n      and Gepidæ were settled on the banks of the Danube and the Rhine.\r\n      A hundred thousand Bastarnæ, expelled from their own country,\r\n      cheerfully accepted an establishment in Thrace, and soon imbibed\r\n      the manners and sentiments of Roman subjects. 48 But the\r\n      expectations of Probus were too often disappointed. The\r\n      impatience and idleness of the barbarians could ill brook the\r\n      slow labors of agriculture. Their unconquerable love of freedom,\r\n      rising against despotism, provoked them into hasty rebellions,\r\n      alike fatal to themselves and to the provinces; 49 nor could\r\n      these artificial supplies, however repeated by succeeding\r\n      emperors, restore the important limit of Gaul and Illyricum to\r\n      its ancient and native vigor.\r\n\r\n      45 (return) [ He distributed about fifty or sixty barbarians to a\r\n      Numerus, as it was then called, a corps with whose established\r\n      number we are not exactly acquainted.]\r\n\r\n      46 (return) [ Camden’s Britannia, Introduction, p. 136; but he\r\n      speaks from a very doubtful conjecture.]\r\n\r\n      47 (return) [ Zosimus, l. i. p. 62.

For a short season they might wander in\r\n      arms through the empire; but in the end they were surely\r\n      destroyed by the power of a warlike emperor. The successful\r\n      rashness of a party of Franks was attended, however, with such\r\n      memorable consequences, that it ought not to be passed unnoticed.\r\n      They had been established by Probus, on the sea-coast of Pontus,\r\n      with a view of strengthening the frontier against the inroads of\r\n      the Alani. A fleet stationed in one of the harbors of the Euxine\r\n      fell into the hands of the Franks; and they resolved, through\r\n      unknown seas, to explore their way from the mouth of the Phasis\r\n      to that of the Rhine. They easily escaped through the Bosphorus\r\n      and the Hellespont, and cruising along the Mediterranean,\r\n      indulged their appetite for revenge and plunder by frequent\r\n      descents on the unsuspecting shores of Asia, Greece, and Africa.\r\n      The opulent city of Syracuse, in whose port the navies of Athens\r\n      and Carthage had formerly been sunk, was sacked by a handful of\r\n      barbarians, who massacred the greatest part of the trembling\r\n      inhabitants. From the island of Sicily the Franks proceeded to\r\n      the columns of Hercules, trusted themselves to the ocean, coasted\r\n      round Spain and Gaul, and steering their triumphant course\r\n      through the British Channel, at length finished their surprising\r\n      voyage, by landing in safety on the Batavian or Frisian shores.\r\n      50 The example of their success, instructing their countrymen to\r\n      conceive the advantages and to despise the dangers of the sea,\r\n      pointed out to their enterprising spirit a new road to wealth and\r\n      glory.\r\n\r\n      50 (return) [ Panegyr. Vet. v. 18. Zosimus, l. i. p. 66.]\r\n\r\n      Notwithstanding the vigilance and activity of Probus, it was\r\n      almost impossible that he could at once contain in obedience\r\n      every part of his wide-extended dominions. The barbarians, who\r\n      broke their chains, had seized the favorable opportunity of a\r\n      domestic war. When the emperor marched to the relief of Gaul, he\r\n      devolved the command of the East on Saturninus. That general, a\r\n      man of merit and experience, was driven into rebellion by the\r\n      absence of his sovereign, the levity of the Alexandrian people,\r\n      the pressing instances of his friends, and his own fears; but\r\n      from the moment of his elevation, he never entertained a hope of\r\n      empire, or even of life. “Alas!” he said, “the republic has lost\r\n      a useful servant, and the rashness of an hour has destroyed the\r\n      services of many years. You know not,” continued he, “the misery\r\n      of sovereign power; a sword is perpetually suspended over our\r\n      head. We dread our very guards, we distrust our companions. The\r\n      choice of action or of repose is no longer in our disposition,\r\n      nor is there any age, or character, or conduct, that can protect\r\n      us from the censure of envy. In thus exalting me to the throne,\r\n      you have doomed me to a life of cares, and to an untimely fate.\r\n      The only consolation which remains is the assurance that I shall\r\n      not fall alone.” 51 But as the former part of his prediction was\r\n      verified by the victory, so the latter was disappointed by the\r\n      clemency, of Probus. That amiable prince attempted even to save\r\n      the unhappy Saturninus from the fury of the soldiers. He had more\r\n      than once solicited the usurper himself to place some confidence\r\n      in the mercy of a sovereign who so highly esteemed his character,\r\n      that he had punished, as a malicious informer, the first who\r\n      related the improbable news of his disaffection. 52 Saturninus\r\n      might, perhaps, have embraced the generous offer, had he not been\r\n      restrained by the obstinate distrust of his adherents. Their\r\n      guilt was deeper, and their hopes more sanguine, than those of\r\n      their experienced leader.\r\n\r\n      51 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 245, 246.

The most distinguished merit of\r\n      those two officers was their respective prowess, of the one in\r\n      the combats of Bacchus, of the other in those of Venus, 53 yet\r\n      neither of them was destitute of courage and capacity, and both\r\n      sustained, with honor, the august character which the fear of\r\n      punishment had engaged them to assume, till they sunk at length\r\n      beneath the superior genius of Probus. He used the victory with\r\n      his accustomed moderation, and spared the fortune, as well as the\r\n      lives of their innocent families. 54\r\n\r\n      53 (return) [ A very surprising instance is recorded of the\r\n      prowess of Proculus.

His mild but steady administration\r\n      confirmed the re-ëstablishment of the public tranquillity; nor\r\n      was there left in the provinces a hostile barbarian, a tyrant, or\r\n      even a robber, to revive the memory of past disorders. It was\r\n      time that the emperor should revisit Rome, and celebrate his own\r\n      glory and the general happiness. The triumph due to the valor of\r\n      Probus was conducted with a magnificence suitable to his fortune,\r\n      and the people, who had so lately admired the trophies of\r\n      Aurelian, gazed with equal pleasure on those of his heroic\r\n      successor. 55 We cannot, on this occasion, forget the desperate\r\n      courage of about fourscore gladiators, reserved, with near six\r\n      hundred others, for the inhuman sports of the amphitheatre.\r\n      Disdaining to shed their blood for the amusement of the populace,\r\n      they killed their keepers, broke from the place of their\r\n      confinement, and filled the streets of Rome with blood and\r\n      confusion. After an obstinate resistance, they were overpowered\r\n      and cut in pieces by the regular forces; but they obtained at\r\n      least an honorable death, and the satisfaction of a just revenge.\r\n      56\r\n\r\n      55 (return) [ Hist.

The latter had punished the irregularities of the soldiers\r\n      with unrelenting severity, the former prevented them by employing\r\n      the legions in constant and useful labors. When Probus commanded\r\n      in Egypt, he executed many considerable works for the splendor\r\n      and benefit of that rich country. The navigation of the Nile, so\r\n      important to Rome itself, was improved; and temples, buildings,\r\n      porticos, and palaces, were constructed by the hands of the\r\n      soldiers, who acted by turns as architects, as engineers, and as\r\n      husbandmen. 57 It was reported of Hannibal, that, in order to\r\n      preserve his troops from the dangerous temptations of idleness,\r\n      he had obliged them to form large plantations of olive-trees\r\n      along the coast of Africa. 58 From a similar principle, Probus\r\n      exercised his legions in covering with rich vineyards the hills\r\n      of Gaul and Pannonia, and two considerable spots are described,\r\n      which were entirely dug and planted by military labor. 59 One of\r\n      these, known under the name of Mount Almo, was situated near\r\n      Sirmium, the country where Probus was born, for which he ever\r\n      retained a partial affection, and whose gratitude he endeavored\r\n      to secure, by converting into tillage a large and unhealthy tract\r\n      of marshy ground. An army thus employed constituted perhaps the\r\n      most useful, as well as the bravest, portion of Roman subjects.\r\n\r\n      57 (return) [ Hist.

The imprudence of Probus is\r\n      said to have inflamed the discontent of his troops. More\r\n      attentive to the interests of mankind than to those of the army,\r\n      he expressed the vain hope, that, by the establishment of\r\n      universal peace, he should soon abolish the necessity of a\r\n      standing and mercenary force. 61 The unguarded expression proved\r\n      fatal to him. In one of the hottest days of summer, as he\r\n      severely urged the unwholesome labor of draining the marshes of\r\n      Sirmium, the soldiers, impatient of fatigue, on a sudden threw\r\n      down their tools, grasped their arms, and broke out into a\r\n      furious mutiny. The emperor, conscious of his danger, took refuge\r\n      in a lofty tower, constructed for the purpose of surveying the\r\n      progress of the work. 62 The tower was instantly forced, and a\r\n      thousand swords were plunged at once into the bosom of the\r\n      unfortunate Probus. The rage of the troops subsided as soon as it\r\n      had been gratified. They then lamented their fatal rashness,\r\n      forgot the severity of the emperor whom they had massacred, and\r\n      hastened to perpetuate, by an honorable monument, the memory of\r\n      his virtues and victories. 63\r\n\r\n      60 (return) [ Julian bestows a severe, and indeed excessive,\r\n      censure on the rigor of Probus, who, as he thinks, almost\r\n      deserved his fate.]\r\n\r\n      61 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist.

Notwithstanding the severe justice which he\r\n      exercised against the assassins of Probus, to whose favor and\r\n      esteem he was highly indebted, he could not escape the suspicion\r\n      of being accessory to a deed from whence he derived the principal\r\n      advantage. He enjoyed, at least before his elevation, an\r\n      acknowledged character of virtue and abilities; 65 but his\r\n      austere temper insensibly degenerated into moroseness and\r\n      cruelty; and the imperfect writers of his life almost hesitate\r\n      whether they shall not rank him in the number of Roman tyrants.\r\n      66 When Carus assumed the purple, he was about sixty years of\r\n      age, and his two sons, Carinus and Numerian had already attained\r\n      the season of manhood. 67\r\n\r\n      64 (return) [ Yet all this may be conciliated.

The election of Carus was decided\r\n      without expecting the approbation of the senate, and the new\r\n      emperor contented himself with announcing, in a cold and stately\r\n      epistle, that he had ascended the vacant throne. 68 A behavior so\r\n      very opposite to that of his amiable predecessor afforded no\r\n      favorable presage of the new reign: and the Romans, deprived of\r\n      power and freedom, asserted their privilege of licentious\r\n      murmurs. 69 The voice of congratulation and flattery was not,\r\n      however, silent; and we may still peruse, with pleasure and\r\n      contempt, an eclogue, which was composed on the accession of the\r\n      emperor Carus.

Before his departure for this distant\r\n      expedition, Carus conferred on his two sons, Carinus and\r\n      Numerian, the title of Cæsar, and investing the former with\r\n      almost an equal share of the Imperial power, directed the young\r\n      prince first to suppress some troubles which had arisen in Gaul,\r\n      and afterwards to fix the seat of his residence at Rome, and to\r\n      assume the government of the Western provinces. 71 The safety of\r\n      Illyricum was confirmed by a memorable defeat of the Sarmatians;\r\n      sixteen thousand of those barbarians remained on the field of\r\n      battle, and the number of captives amounted to twenty thousand.\r\n      The old emperor, animated with the fame and prospect of victory,\r\n      pursued his march, in the midst of winter, through the countries\r\n      of Thrace and Asia Minor, and at length, with his younger son,\r\n      Numerian, arrived on the confines of the Persian monarchy.

The\r\n      conference was conducted with the same disregard of courtly\r\n      elegance. Carus, taking off a cap which he wore to conceal his\r\n      baldness, assured the ambassadors, that, unless their master\r\n      acknowledged the superiority of Rome, he would speedily render\r\n      Persia as naked of trees as his own head was destitute of hair.\r\n      73 Notwithstanding some traces of art and preparation, we may\r\n      discover in this scene the manners of Carus, and the severe\r\n      simplicity which the martial princes, who succeeded Gallienus,\r\n      had already restored in the Roman camps.

Notwithstanding all the arts that were practised to\r\n      disguise the manner of the late emperor’s death, it was found\r\n      impossible to remove the opinion of the multitude, and the power\r\n      of opinion is irresistible. Places or persons struck with\r\n      lightning were considered by the ancients with pious horror, as\r\n      singularly devoted to the wrath of Heaven. 78 An oracle was\r\n      remembered, which marked the River Tigris as the fatal boundary\r\n      of the Roman arms. The troops, terrified with the fate of Carus\r\n      and with their own danger, called aloud on young Numerian to obey\r\n      the will of the gods, and to lead them away from this\r\n      inauspicious scene of war. The feeble emperor was unable to\r\n      subdue their obstinate prejudice, and the Persians wondered at\r\n      the unexpected retreat of a victorious enemy. 79\r\n\r\n      77 (return) [ See Nemesian.

Aurelius Victor\r\n      seems to believe the prediction, and to approve the retreat.]\r\n\r\n      The intelligence of the mysterious fate of the late emperor was\r\n      soon carried from the frontiers of Persia to Rome; and the\r\n      senate, as well as the provinces, congratulated the accession of\r\n      the sons of Carus. These fortunate youths were strangers,\r\n      however, to that conscious superiority, either of birth or of\r\n      merit, which can alone render the possession of a throne easy,\r\n      and, as it were, natural. Born and educated in a private station,\r\n      the election of their father raised them at once to the rank of\r\n      princes; and his death, which happened about sixteen months\r\n      afterwards, left them the unexpected legacy of a vast empire. To\r\n      sustain with temper this rapid elevation, an uncommon share of\r\n      virtue and prudence was requisite; and Carinus, the elder of the\r\n      brothers, was more than commonly deficient in those qualities. In\r\n      the Gallic war he discovered some degree of personal courage; 80\r\n      but from the moment of his arrival at Rome, he abandoned himself\r\n      to the luxury of the capital, and to the abuse of his fortune. He\r\n      was soft, yet cruel; devoted to pleasure, but destitute of taste;\r\n      and though exquisitely susceptible of vanity, indifferent to the\r\n      public esteem. In the course of a few months, he successively\r\n      married and divorced nine wives, most of whom he left pregnant;\r\n      and notwithstanding this legal inconstancy, found time to indulge\r\n      such a variety of irregular appetites, as brought dishonor on\r\n      himself and on the noblest houses of Rome. He beheld with\r\n      inveterate hatred all those who might remember his former\r\n      obscurity, or censure his present conduct. He banished, or put to\r\n      death, the friends and counsellors whom his father had placed\r\n      about him, to guide his inexperienced youth; and he persecuted\r\n      with the meanest revenge his school-fellows and companions who\r\n      had not sufficiently respected the latent majesty of the emperor.\r\n\r\n      With the senators, Carinus affected a lofty and regal demeanor,\r\n      frequently declaring, that he designed to distribute their\r\n      estates among the populace of Rome. From the dregs of that\r\n      populace he selected his favorites, and even his ministers. The\r\n      palace, and even the Imperial table, were filled with singers,\r\n      dancers, prostitutes, and all the various retinue of vice and\r\n      folly. One of his doorkeepers 81 he intrusted with the government\r\n      of the city. In the room of the Prætorian præfect, whom he put to\r\n      death, Carinus substituted one of the ministers of his looser\r\n      pleasures. Another, who possessed the same, or even a more\r\n      infamous, title to favor, was invested with the consulship. A\r\n      confidential secretary, who had acquired uncommon skill in the\r\n      art of forgery, delivered the indolent emperor, with his own\r\n      consent from the irksome duty of signing his name.\r\n\r\n      80 (return) [ Nemesian.

The intelligence which he soon\r\n      received of the conduct of Carinus filled him with shame and\r\n      regret; nor had he concealed his resolution of satisfying the\r\n      republic by a severe act of justice, and of adopting, in the\r\n      place of an unworthy son, the brave and virtuous Constantius, who\r\n      at that time was governor of Dalmatia. But the elevation of\r\n      Constantius was for a while deferred; and as soon as the father’s\r\n      death had released Carinus from the control of fear or decency,\r\n      he displayed to the Romans the extravagancies of Elagabalus,\r\n      aggravated by the cruelty of Domitian. 82\r\n\r\n      82 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist.

More than\r\n      twenty years afterwards, when the courtiers of Diocletian\r\n      represented to their frugal sovereign the fame and popularity of\r\n      his munificent predecessor, he acknowledged that the reign of\r\n      Carinus had indeed been a reign of pleasure. 83 But this vain\r\n      prodigality, which the prudence of Diocletian might justly\r\n      despise, was enjoyed with surprise and transport by the Roman\r\n      people. The oldest of the citizens, recollecting the spectacles\r\n      of former days, the triumphal pomp of Probus or Aurelian, and the\r\n      secular games of the emperor Philip, acknowledged that they were\r\n      all surpassed by the superior magnificence of Carinus. 84\r\n\r\n      83 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist.

We may observe,\r\n      that the spectacles of Probus were still recent, and that the\r\n      poet is seconded by the historian.]\r\n\r\n      The spectacles of Carinus may therefore be best illustrated by\r\n      the observation of some particulars, which history has\r\n      condescended to relate concerning those of his predecessors. If\r\n      we confine ourselves solely to the hunting of wild beasts,\r\n      however we may censure the vanity of the design or the cruelty of\r\n      the execution, we are obliged to confess that neither before nor\r\n      since the time of the Romans so much art and expense have ever\r\n      been lavished for the amusement of the people. 85 By the order of\r\n      Probus, a great quantity of large trees, torn up by the roots,\r\n      were transplanted into the midst of the circus. The spacious and\r\n      shady forest was immediately filled with a thousand ostriches, a\r\n      thousand stags, a thousand fallow deer, and a thousand wild\r\n      boars; and all this variety of game was abandoned to the riotous\r\n      impetuosity of the multitude. The tragedy of the succeeding day\r\n      consisted in the massacre of a hundred lions, an equal number of\r\n      lionesses, two hundred leopards, and three hundred bears. 86 The\r\n      collection prepared by the younger Gordian for his triumph, and\r\n      which his successor exhibited in the secular games, was less\r\n      remarkable by the number than by the singularity of the animals.\r\n      Twenty zebras displayed their elegant forms and variegated beauty\r\n      to the eyes of the Roman people. 87 Ten elks, and as many\r\n      camelopards, the loftiest and most harmless creatures that wander\r\n      over the plains of Sarmatia and Æthiopia, were contrasted with\r\n      thirty African hyænas and ten Indian tigers, the most implacable\r\n      savages of the torrid zone. The unoffending strength with which\r\n      Nature has endowed the greater quadrupeds was admired in the\r\n      rhinoceros, the hippopotamus of the Nile, 88 and a majestic troop\r\n      of thirty-two elephants. 89 While the populace gazed with stupid\r\n      wonder on the splendid show, the naturalist might indeed observe\r\n      the figure and properties of so many different species,\r\n      transported from every part of the ancient world into the\r\n      amphitheatre of Rome. But this accidental benefit, which science\r\n      might derive from folly, is surely insufficient to justify such a\r\n      wanton abuse of the public riches. There occurs, however, a\r\n      single instance in the first Punic war, in which the senate\r\n      wisely connected this amusement of the multitude with the\r\n      interest of the state. A considerable number of elephants, taken\r\n      in the defeat of the Carthaginian army, were driven through the\r\n      circus by a few slaves, armed only with blunt javelins. 90 The\r\n      useful spectacle served to impress the Roman soldier with a just\r\n      contempt for those unwieldy animals; and he no longer dreaded to\r\n      encounter them in the ranks of war.\r\n\r\n      85 (return) [ The philosopher Montaigne (Essais, l. iii. 6) gives\r\n      a very just and lively view of Roman magnificence in these\r\n      spectacles.]\r\n\r\n      86 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist.

Posterity\r\n      admires, and will long admire, the awful remains of the\r\n      amphitheatre of Titus, which so well deserved the epithet of\r\n      Colossal. 91 It was a building of an elliptic figure, five\r\n      hundred and sixty-four feet in length, and four hundred and\r\n      sixty-seven in breadth, founded on fourscore arches, and rising,\r\n      with four successive orders of architecture, to the height of one\r\n      hundred and forty feet. 92 The outside of the edifice was\r\n      encrusted with marble, and decorated with statues. The slopes of\r\n      the vast concave, which formed the inside, were filled and\r\n      surrounded with sixty or eighty rows of seats of marble likewise,\r\n      covered with cushions, and capable of receiving with ease about\r\n      fourscore thousand spectators. 93 Sixty-four _vomitories_ (for by\r\n      that name the doors were very aptly distinguished) poured forth\r\n      the immense multitude; and the entrances, passages, and\r\n      staircases were contrived with such exquisite skill, that each\r\n      person, whether of the senatorial, the equestrian, or the\r\n      plebeian order, arrived at his destined place without trouble or\r\n      confusion. 94 Nothing was omitted, which, in any respect, could\r\n      be subservient to the convenience and pleasure of the spectators.\r\n\r\n      They were protected from the sun and rain by an ample canopy,\r\n      occasionally drawn over their heads. The air was continally\r\n      refreshed by the playing of fountains, and profusely impregnated\r\n      by the grateful scent of aromatics. In the centre of the edifice,\r\n      the _arena_, or stage, was strewed with the finest sand, and\r\n      successively assumed the most different forms. At one moment it\r\n      seemed to rise out of the earth, like the garden of the\r\n      Hesperides, and was afterwards broken into the rocks and caverns\r\n      of Thrace. The subterraneous pipes conveyed an inexhaustible\r\n      supply of water; and what had just before appeared a level plain,\r\n      might be suddenly converted into a wide lake, covered with armed\r\n      vessels, and replenished with the monsters of the deep. 95 In the\r\n      decoration of these scenes, the Roman emperors displayed their\r\n      wealth and liberality; and we read on various occasions that the\r\n      whole furniture of the amphitheatre consisted either of silver,\r\n      or of gold, or of amber. 96 The poet who describes the games of\r\n      Carinus, in the character of a shepherd, attracted to the capital\r\n      by the fame of their magnificence, affirms that the nets designed\r\n      as a defence against the wild beasts were of gold wire; that the\r\n      porticos were gilded; and that the _belt_ or circle which divided\r\n      the several ranks of spectators from each other was studded with\r\n      a precious mosaic of beautiful stones. 97\r\n\r\n      91 (return) [ See Maffei, Verona Illustrata, p. iv. l. i. c. 2.]\r\n\r\n      92 (return) [ Maffei, l. ii. c. 2.

The arrangements which their new situation required were\r\n      probably deferred till the return of the younger brother to Rome,\r\n      where a triumph was decreed to the young emperors for the\r\n      glorious success of the Persian war. 100 It is uncertain whether\r\n      they intended to divide between them the administration, or the\r\n      provinces, of the empire; but it is very unlikely that their\r\n      union would have proved of any long duration. The jealousy of\r\n      power must have been inflamed by the opposition of characters. In\r\n      the most corrupt of times, Carinus was unworthy to live: Numerian\r\n      deserved to reign in a happier period. His affable manners and\r\n      gentle virtues secured him, as soon as they became known, the\r\n      regard and affections of the public. He possessed the elegant\r\n      accomplishments of a poet and orator, which dignify as well as\r\n      adorn the humblest and the most exalted station. His eloquence,\r\n      however it was applauded by the senate, was formed not so much on\r\n      the model of Cicero, as on that of the modern declaimers; but in\r\n      an age very far from being destitute of poetical merit, he\r\n      contended for the prize with the most celebrated of his\r\n      contemporaries, and still remained the friend of his rivals; a\r\n      circumstance which evinces either the goodness of his heart, or\r\n      the superiority of his genius. 101 But the talents of Numerian\r\n      were rather of the contemplative than of the active kind. When\r\n      his father’s elevation reluctantly forced him from the shade of\r\n      retirement, neither his temper nor his pursuits had qualified him\r\n      for the command of armies. His constitution was destroyed by the\r\n      hardships of the Persian war; and he had contracted, from the\r\n      heat of the climate, 102 such a weakness in his eyes, as obliged\r\n      him, in the course of a long retreat, to confine himself to the\r\n      solitude and darkness of a tent or litter.\r\n\r\n      The administration of all affairs, civil as well as military, was\r\n      devolved on Arrius Aper, the Prætorian præfect, who to the power\r\n      of his important office added the honor of being father-in-law to\r\n      Numerian. The Imperial pavilion was strictly guarded by his most\r\n      trusty adherents; and during many days, Aper delivered to the\r\n      army the supposed mandates of their invisible sovereign. 103\r\n\r\n      100 (return) [ Nemesianus (in the Cynegeticon) seems to\r\n      anticipate in his fancy that auspicious day.]\r\n\r\n      101 (return) [ He won all the crowns from Nemesianus, with whom\r\n      he vied in didactic poetry.

August. p. 250.]\r\n\r\n      It was not till eight months after the death of Carus, that the\r\n      Roman army, returning by slow marches from the banks of the\r\n      Tigris, arrived on those of the Thracian Bosphorus. The legions\r\n      halted at Chalcedon in Asia, while the court passed over to\r\n      Heraclea, on the European side of the Propontis. 104 But a report\r\n      soon circulated through the camp, at first in secret whispers,\r\n      and at length in loud clamors, of the emperor’s death, and of the\r\n      presumption of his ambitious minister, who still exercised the\r\n      sovereign power in the name of a prince who was no more. The\r\n      impatience of the soldiers could not long support a state of\r\n      suspense. With rude curiosity they broke into the Imperial tent,\r\n      and discovered only the corpse of Numerian. 105 The gradual\r\n      decline of his health might have induced them to believe that his\r\n      death was natural; but the concealment was interpreted as an\r\n      evidence of guilt, and the measures which Aper had taken to\r\n      secure his election became the immediate occasion of his ruin.\r\n      Yet, even in the transport of their rage and grief, the troops\r\n      observed a regular proceeding, which proves how firmly discipline\r\n      had been reëstablished by the martial successors of Gallienus. A\r\n      general assembly of the army was appointed to be held at\r\n      Chalcedon, whither Aper was transported in chains, as a prisoner\r\n      and a criminal. A vacant tribunal was erected in the midst of the\r\n      camp, and the generals and tribunes formed a great military\r\n      council. They soon announced to the multitude that their choice\r\n      had fallen on Diocletian, commander of the domestics or\r\n      body-guards, as the person the most capable of revenging and\r\n      succeeding their beloved emperor. The future fortunes of the\r\n      candidate depended on the chance or conduct of the present hour.\r\n      Conscious that the station which he had filled exposed him to\r\n      some suspicions, Diocletian ascended the tribunal, and raising\r\n      his eyes towards the Sun, made a solemn profession of his own\r\n      innocence, in the presence of that all-seeing Deity. 106 Then,\r\n      assuming the tone of a sovereign and a judge, he commanded that\r\n      Aper should be brought in chains to the foot of the tribunal.\r\n      “This man,” said he, “is the murderer of Numerian;” and without\r\n      giving him time to enter on a dangerous justification, drew his\r\n      sword, and buried it in the breast of the unfortunate præfect. A\r\n      charge supported by such decisive proof was admitted without\r\n      contradiction, and the legions, with repeated acclamations,\r\n      acknowledged the justice and authority of the emperor Diocletian.\r\n      107\r\n\r\n      104 (return) [ We are obliged to the Alexandrian Chronicle, p.\r\n      274, for the knowledge of the time and place where Diocletian was\r\n      elected emperor.]\r\n\r\n      105 (return) [ Hist.

But his personal vices overbalanced\r\n      every advantage of birth and situation. The most faithful\r\n      servants of the father despised the incapacity, and dreaded the\r\n      cruel arrogance, of the son. The hearts of the people were\r\n      engaged in favor of his rival, and even the senate was inclined\r\n      to prefer a usurper to a tyrant. The arts of Diocletian inflamed\r\n      the general discontent; and the winter was employed in secret\r\n      intrigues, and open preparations for a civil war. In the spring,\r\n      the forces of the East and of the West encountered each other in\r\n      the plains of Margus, a small city of Mæsia, in the neighborhood\r\n      of the Danube. 108 The troops, so lately returned from the\r\n      Persian war, had acquired their glory at the expense of health\r\n      and numbers; nor were they in a condition to contend with the\r\n      unexhausted strength of the legions of Europe. Their ranks were\r\n      broken, and, for a moment, Diocletian despaired of the purple and\r\n      of life. But the advantage which Carinus had obtained by the\r\n      valor of his soldiers, he quickly lost by the infidelity of his\r\n      officers. A tribune, whose wife he had seduced, seized the\r\n      opportunity of revenge, and, by a single blow, extinguished civil\r\n      discord in the blood of the adulterer. 109\r\n\r\n      108 (return) [ Eutropius marks its situation very accurately; it\r\n      was between the Mons Aureus and Viminiacum.

The parents of Diocletian had been\r\n      slaves in the house of Anulinus, a Roman senator; nor was he\r\n      himself distinguished by any other name than that which he\r\n      derived from a small town in Dalmatia, from whence his mother\r\n      deduced her origin. 1 It is, however, probable that his father\r\n      obtained the freedom of the family, and that he soon acquired an\r\n      office of scribe, which was commonly exercised by persons of his\r\n      condition. 2 Favorable oracles, or rather the consciousness of\r\n      superior merit, prompted his aspiring son to pursue the\r\n      profession of arms and the hopes of fortune; and it would be\r\n      extremely curious to observe the gradation of arts and accidents\r\n      which enabled him in the end to fulfil those oracles, and to\r\n      display that merit to the world. Diocletian was successively\r\n      promoted to the government of Mæsia, the honors of the\r\n      consulship, and the important command of the guards of the\r\n      palace. He distinguished his abilities in the Persian war; and\r\n      after the death of Numerian, the slave, by the confession and\r\n      judgment of his rivals, was declared the most worthy of the\r\n      Imperial throne. The malice of religious zeal, whilst it arraigns\r\n      the savage fierceness of his colleague Maximian, has affected to\r\n      cast suspicions on the personal courage of the emperor\r\n      Diocletian. 3 It would not be easy to persuade us of the\r\n      cowardice of a soldier of fortune, who acquired and preserved the\r\n      esteem of the legions as well as the favor of so many warlike\r\n      princes. Yet even calumny is sagacious enough to discover and to\r\n      attack the most vulnerable part. The valor of Diocletian was\r\n      never found inadequate to his duty, or to the occasion; but he\r\n      appears not to have possessed the daring and generous spirit of a\r\n      hero, who courts danger and fame, disdains artifice, and boldly\r\n      challenges the allegiance of his equals. His abilities were\r\n      useful rather than splendid; a vigorous mind, improved by the\r\n      experience and study of mankind; dexterity and application in\r\n      business; a judicious mixture of liberality and economy, of\r\n      mildness and rigor; profound dissimulation, under the disguise of\r\n      military frankness; steadiness to pursue his ends; flexibility to\r\n      vary his means; and, above all, the great art of submitting his\r\n      own passions, as well as those of others, to the interest of his\r\n      ambition, and of coloring his ambition with the most specious\r\n      pretences of justice and public utility. Like Augustus,\r\n      Diocletian may be considered as the founder of a new empire. Like\r\n      the adopted son of Cæsar, he was distinguished as a statesman\r\n      rather than as a warrior; nor did either of those princes employ\r\n      force, whenever their purpose could be effected by policy.\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ Eutrop. ix. 19.

In chap. 9 he says of him, “erat in omni\r\n      tumultu meticulosu et animi disjectus.”]\r\n\r\n      The victory of Diocletian was remarkable for its singular\r\n      mildness. A people accustomed to applaud the clemency of the\r\n      conqueror, if the usual punishments of death, exile, and\r\n      confiscation, were inflicted with any degree of temper and\r\n      equity, beheld, with the most pleasing astonishment, a civil war,\r\n      the flames of which were extinguished in the field of battle.\r\n      Diocletian received into his confidence Aristobulus, the\r\n      principal minister of the house of Carus, respected the lives,\r\n      the fortunes, and the dignity, of his adversaries, and even\r\n      continued in their respective stations the greater number of the\r\n      servants of Carinus. 4 It is not improbable that motives of\r\n      prudence might assist the humanity of the artful Dalmatian; of\r\n      these servants, many had purchased his favor by secret treachery;\r\n      in others, he esteemed their grateful fidelity to an unfortunate\r\n      master. The discerning judgment of Aurelian, of Probus, and of\r\n      Carus, had filled the several departments of the state and army\r\n      with officers of approved merit, whose removal would have injured\r\n      the public service, without promoting the interest of his\r\n      successor. Such a conduct, however, displayed to the Roman world\r\n      the fairest prospect of the new reign, and the emperor affected\r\n      to confirm this favorable prepossession, by declaring, that,\r\n      among all the virtues of his predecessors, he was the most\r\n      ambitious of imitating the humane philosophy of Marcus Antoninus.\r\n      5\r\n\r\n      4 (return) [ In this encomium, Aurelius Victor seems to convey a\r\n      just, though indirect, censure of the cruelty of Constantius.

August. p. 30.]\r\n\r\n      The first considerable action of his reign seemed to evince his\r\n      sincerity as well as his moderation. After the example of Marcus,\r\n      he gave himself a colleague in the person of Maximian, on whom he\r\n      bestowed at first the title of Cæsar, and afterwards that of\r\n      Augustus. 6 But the motives of his conduct, as well as the object\r\n      of his choice, were of a very different nature from those of his\r\n      admired predecessor. By investing a luxurious youth with the\r\n      honors of the purple, Marcus had discharged a debt of private\r\n      gratitude, at the expense, indeed, of the happiness of the state.\r\n      By associating a friend and a fellow-soldier to the labors of\r\n      government, Diocletian, in a time of public danger, provided for\r\n      the defence both of the East and of the West. Maximian was born a\r\n      peasant, and, like Aurelian, in the territory of Sirmium.\r\n      Ignorant of letters, 7 careless of laws, the rusticity of his\r\n      appearance and manners still betrayed in the most elevated\r\n      fortune the meanness of his extraction. War was the only art\r\n      which he professed. In a long course of service he had\r\n      distinguished himself on every frontier of the empire; and though\r\n      his military talents were formed to obey rather than to command,\r\n      though, perhaps, he never attained the skill of a consummate\r\n      general, he was capable, by his valor, constancy, and experience,\r\n      of executing the most arduous undertakings. Nor were the vices of\r\n      Maximian less useful to his benefactor. Insensible to pity, and\r\n      fearless of consequences, he was the ready instrument of every\r\n      act of cruelty which the policy of that artful prince might at\r\n      once suggest and disclaim. As soon as a bloody sacrifice had been\r\n      offered to prudence or to revenge, Diocletian, by his seasonable\r\n      intercession, saved the remaining few whom he had never designed\r\n      to punish, gently censured the severity of his stern colleague,\r\n      and enjoyed the comparison of a golden and an iron age, which was\r\n      universally applied to their opposite maxims of government.\r\n      Notwithstanding the difference of their characters, the two\r\n      emperors maintained, on the throne, that friendship which they\r\n      had contracted in a private station. The haughty, turbulent\r\n      spirit of Maximian, so fatal, afterwards, to himself and to the\r\n      public peace, was accustomed to respect the genius of Diocletian,\r\n      and confessed the ascendant of reason over brutal violence. 8\r\n      From a motive either of pride or superstition, the two emperors\r\n      assumed the titles, the one of Jovius, the other of Herculius.\r\n      Whilst the motion of the world (such was the language of their\r\n      venal orators) was maintained by the all-seeing wisdom of\r\n      Jupiter, the invincible arm of Hercules purged the earth from\r\n      monsters and tyrants. 9\r\n\r\n      6 (return) [ The question of the time when Maximian received the\r\n      honors of Cæsar and Augustus has divided modern critics, and\r\n      given occasion to a great deal of learned wrangling.

The prudence\r\n      of Diocletian discovered that the empire, assailed on every side\r\n      by the barbarians, required on every side the presence of a great\r\n      army, and of an emperor. With this view, he resolved once more to\r\n      divide his unwieldy power, and with the inferior title of\r\n      _Cæsars_, 901 to confer on two generals of approved merit an\r\n      unequal share of the sovereign authority. 10 Galerius, surnamed\r\n      Armentarius, from his original profession of a herdsman, and\r\n      Constantius, who from his pale complexion had acquired the\r\n      denomination of Chlorus, 11 were the two persons invested with\r\n      the second honors of the Imperial purple. In describing the\r\n      country, extraction, and manners of Herculius, we have already\r\n      delineated those of Galerius, who was often, and not improperly,\r\n      styled the younger Maximian, though, in many instances both of\r\n      virtue and ability, he appears to have possessed a manifest\r\n      superiority over the elder. The birth of Constantius was less\r\n      obscure than that of his colleagues. Eutropius, his father, was\r\n      one of the most considerable nobles of Dardania, and his mother\r\n      was the niece of the emperor Claudius. 12 Although the youth of\r\n      Constantius had been spent in arms, he was endowed with a mild\r\n      and amiable disposition, and the popular voice had long since\r\n      acknowledged him worthy of the rank which he at last attained. To\r\n      strengthen the bonds of political, by those of domestic, union,\r\n      each of the emperors assumed the character of a father to one of\r\n      the Cæsars, Diocletian to Galerius, and Maximian to Constantius;\r\n      and each, obliging them to repudiate their former wives, bestowed\r\n      his daughter in marriage or his adopted son. 13 These four\r\n      princes distributed among themselves the wide extent of the Roman\r\n      empire. The defence of Gaul, Spain, 14 and Britain, was intrusted\r\n      to Constantius: Galerius was stationed on the banks of the\r\n      Danube, as the safeguard of the Illyrian provinces. Italy and\r\n      Africa were considered as the department of Maximian; and for his\r\n      peculiar portion, Diocletian reserved Thrace, Egypt, and the rich\r\n      countries of Asia. Every one was sovereign with his own\r\n      jurisdiction; but their united authority extended over the whole\r\n      monarchy, and each of them was prepared to assist his colleagues\r\n      with his counsels or presence. The Cæsars, in their exalted rank,\r\n      revered the majesty of the emperors, and the three younger\r\n      princes invariably acknowledged, by their gratitude and\r\n      obedience, the common parent of their fortunes. The suspicious\r\n      jealousy of power found not any place among them; and the\r\n      singular happiness of their union has been compared to a chorus\r\n      of music, whose harmony was regulated and maintained by the\r\n      skilful hand of the first artist. 15\r\n\r\n      901 (return) [ On the relative power of the Augusti and the\r\n      Cæsars, consult a dissertation at the end of Manso’s Leben\r\n      Constantius des Grossen—M.]\r\n\r\n      10 (return) [ Aurelius Victor.

But we have\r\n      preferred, for the sake of perspicuity, first to describe the\r\n      more perfect form of Diocletian’s government, and afterwards to\r\n      relate the actions of his reign, following rather the natural\r\n      order of the events, than the dates of a very doubtful\r\n      chronology.\r\n\r\n      The first exploit of Maximian, though it is mentioned in a few\r\n      words by our imperfect writers, deserves, from its singularity,\r\n      to be recorded in a history of human manners. He suppressed the\r\n      peasants of Gaul, who, under the appellation of Bagaudæ, 16 had\r\n      risen in a general insurrection; very similar to those which in\r\n      the fourteenth century successively afflicted both France and\r\n      England. 17 It should seem that very many of those institutions,\r\n      referred by an easy solution to the feudal system, are derived\r\n      from the Celtic barbarians. When Cæsar subdued the Gauls, that\r\n      great nation was already divided into three orders of men; the\r\n      clergy, the nobility, and the common people. The first governed\r\n      by superstition, the second by arms, but the third and last was\r\n      not of any weight or account in their public councils. It was\r\n      very natural for the plebeians, oppressed by debt, or\r\n      apprehensive of injuries, to implore the protection of some\r\n      powerful chief, who acquired over their persons and property the\r\n      same absolute right as, among the Greeks and Romans, a master\r\n      exercised over his slaves. 18 The greatest part of the nation was\r\n      gradually reduced into a state of servitude; compelled to\r\n      perpetual labor on the estates of the Gallic nobles, and confined\r\n      to the soil, either by the real weight of fetters, or by the no\r\n      less cruel and forcible restraints of the laws. During the long\r\n      series of troubles which agitated Gaul, from the reign of\r\n      Gallienus to that of Diocletian, the condition of these servile\r\n      peasants was peculiarly miserable; and they experienced at once\r\n      the complicated tyranny of their masters, of the barbarians, of\r\n      the soldiers, and of the officers of the revenue. 19\r\n\r\n      16 (return) [ The general name of Bagaudæ (in the signification\r\n      of rebels) continued till the fifth century in Gaul.

On every side\r\n      they rose in multitudes, armed with rustic weapons, and with\r\n      irresistible fury. The ploughman became a foot soldier, the\r\n      shepherd mounted on horseback, the deserted villages and open\r\n      towns were abandoned to the flames, and the ravages of the\r\n      peasants equalled those of the fiercest barbarians. 20 They\r\n      asserted the natural rights of men, but they asserted those\r\n      rights with the most savage cruelty. The Gallic nobles, justly\r\n      dreading their revenge, either took refuge in the fortified\r\n      cities, or fled from the wild scene of anarchy. The peasants\r\n      reigned without control; and two of their most daring leaders had\r\n      the folly and rashness to assume the Imperial ornaments. 21 Their\r\n      power soon expired at the approach of the legions. The strength\r\n      of union and discipline obtained an easy victory over a\r\n      licentious and divided multitude. 22 A severe retaliation was\r\n      inflicted on the peasants who were found in arms; the affrighted\r\n      remnant returned to their respective habitations, and their\r\n      unsuccessful effort for freedom served only to confirm their\r\n      slavery.

The integrity of the new\r\n      admiral corresponded not with his abilities. When the German\r\n      pirates sailed from their own harbors, he connived at their\r\n      passage, but he diligently intercepted their return, and\r\n      appropriated to his own use an ample share of the spoil which\r\n      they had acquired. The wealth of Carausius was, on this occasion,\r\n      very justly considered as an evidence of his guilt; and Maximian\r\n      had already given orders for his death. But the crafty Menapian\r\n      foresaw and prevented the severity of the emperor. By his\r\n      liberality he had attached to his fortunes the fleet which he\r\n      commanded, and secured the barbarians in his interest. From the\r\n      port of Boulogne he sailed over to Britain, persuaded the legion,\r\n      and the auxiliaries which guarded that island, to embrace his\r\n      party, and boldly assuming, with the Imperial purple, the title\r\n      of Augustus, defied the justice and the arms of his injured\r\n      sovereign. 26\r\n\r\n      24 (return) [ Aurelius Victor calls them Germans.

Britain at this time was secure,\r\n      and slightly guarded.]\r\n\r\n      When Britain was thus dismembered from the empire, its importance\r\n      was sensibly felt, and its loss sincerely lamented. The Romans\r\n      celebrated, and perhaps magnified, the extent of that noble\r\n      island, provided on every side with convenient harbors; the\r\n      temperature of the climate, and the fertility of the soil, alike\r\n      adapted for the production of corn or of vines; the valuable\r\n      minerals with which it abounded; its rich pastures covered with\r\n      innumerable flocks, and its woods free from wild beasts or\r\n      venomous serpents. Above all, they regretted the large amount of\r\n      the revenue of Britain, whilst they confessed, that such a\r\n      province well deserved to become the seat of an independent\r\n      monarchy. 27 During the space of seven years it was possessed by\r\n      Carausius; and fortune continued propitious to a rebellion\r\n      supported with courage and ability. The British emperor defended\r\n      the frontiers of his dominions against the Caledonians of the\r\n      North, invited, from the continent, a great number of skilful\r\n      artists, and displayed, on a variety of coins that are still\r\n      extant, his taste and opulence. Born on the confines of the\r\n      Franks, he courted the friendship of that formidable people, by\r\n      the flattering imitation of their dress and manners. The bravest\r\n      of their youth he enlisted among his land or sea forces; and, in\r\n      return for their useful alliance, he communicated to the\r\n      barbarians the dangerous knowledge of military and naval arts.\r\n      Carausius still preserved the possession of Boulogne and the\r\n      adjacent country. His fleets rode triumphant in the channel,\r\n      commanded the mouths of the Seine and of the Rhine, ravaged the\r\n      coasts of the ocean, and diffused beyond the columns of Hercules\r\n      the terror of his name. Under his command, Britain, destined in a\r\n      future age to obtain the empire of the sea, already assumed its\r\n      natural and respectable station of a maritime power. 28\r\n\r\n      27 (return) [ Panegyr.

And when, after a\r\n      vast expense of time and labor, a new armament was launched into\r\n      the water, 29 the Imperial troops, unaccustomed to that element,\r\n      were easily baffled and defeated by the veteran sailors of the\r\n      usurper. This disappointed effort was soon productive of a treaty\r\n      of peace. Diocletian and his colleague, who justly dreaded the\r\n      enterprising spirit of Carausius, resigned to him the sovereignty\r\n      of Britain, and reluctantly admitted their perfidious servant to\r\n      a participation of the Imperial honors. 30 But the adoption of\r\n      the two Cæsars restored new vigor to the Romans arms; and while\r\n      the Rhine was guarded by the presence of Maximian, his brave\r\n      associate Constantius assumed the conduct of the British war. His\r\n      first enterprise was against the important place of Boulogne. A\r\n      stupendous mole, raised across the entrance of the harbor,\r\n      intercepted all hopes of relief. The town surrendered after an\r\n      obstinate defence; and a considerable part of the naval strength\r\n      of Carausius fell into the hands of the besiegers. During the\r\n      three years which Constantius employed in preparing a fleet\r\n      adequate to the conquest of Britain, he secured the coast of\r\n      Gaul, invaded the country of the Franks, and deprived the usurper\r\n      of the assistance of those powerful allies.\r\n\r\n      29 (return) [ When Mamertinus pronounced his first panegyric, the\r\n      naval preparations of Maximian were completed; and the orator\r\n      presaged an assured victory.

The servants of\r\n      Carausius imitated the example of treason which he had given. He\r\n      was murdered by his first minister, Allectus, and the assassin\r\n      succeeded to his power and to his danger. But he possessed not\r\n      equal abilities either to exercise the one or to repel the other.\r\n\r\n      He beheld, with anxious terror, the opposite shores of the\r\n      continent already filled with arms, with troops, and with\r\n      vessels; for Constantius had very prudently divided his forces,\r\n      that he might likewise divide the attention and resistance of the\r\n      enemy. The attack was at length made by the principal squadron,\r\n      which, under the command of the præfect Asclepiodatus, an officer\r\n      of distinguished merit, had been assembled in the north of the\r\n      Seine. So imperfect in those times was the art of navigation,\r\n      that orators have celebrated the daring courage of the Romans,\r\n      who ventured to set sail with a side-wind, and on a stormy day.\r\n      The weather proved favorable to their enterprise. Under the cover\r\n      of a thick fog, they escaped the fleet of Allectus, which had\r\n      been stationed off the Isle of Wight to receive them, landed in\r\n      safety on some part of the western coast, and convinced the\r\n      Britons, that a superiority of naval strength will not always\r\n      protect their country from a foreign invasion. Asclepiodatus had\r\n      no sooner disembarked the imperial troops, then he set fire to\r\n      his ships; and, as the expedition proved fortunate, his heroic\r\n      conduct was universally admired. The usurper had posted himself\r\n      near London, to expect the formidable attack of Constantius, who\r\n      commanded in person the fleet of Boulogne; but the descent of a\r\n      new enemy required his immediate presence in the West. He\r\n      performed this long march in so precipitate a manner, that he\r\n      encountered the whole force of the præfect with a small body of\r\n      harassed and disheartened troops. The engagement was soon\r\n      terminated by the total defeat and death of Allectus; a single\r\n      battle, as it has often happened, decided the fate of this great\r\n      island; and when Constantius landed on the shores of Kent, he\r\n      found them covered with obedient subjects. Their acclamations\r\n      were loud and unanimous; and the virtues of the conqueror may\r\n      induce us to believe, that they sincerely rejoiced in a\r\n      revolution, which, after a separation of ten years, restored\r\n      Britain to the body of the Roman empire. 31\r\n\r\n      31 (return) [ With regard to the recovery of Britain, we obtain a\r\n      few hints from Aurelius Victor and Eutropius.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter XIII: Reign Of Diocletian And His Three Associates.—Part\r\n      II.\r\n\r\n      Britain had none but domestic enemies to dread; and as long as\r\n      the governors preserved their fidelity, and the troops their\r\n      discipline, the incursions of the naked savages of Scotland or\r\n      Ireland could never materially affect the safety of the province.\r\n\r\n      The peace of the continent, and the defence of the principal\r\n      rivers which bounded the empire, were objects of far greater\r\n      difficulty and importance. The policy of Diocletian, which\r\n      inspired the councils of his associates, provided for the public\r\n      tranquility, by encouraging a spirit of dissension among the\r\n      barbarians, and by strengthening the fortifications of the Roman\r\n      limit. In the East he fixed a line of camps from Egypt to the\r\n      Persian dominions, and for every camp, he instituted an adequate\r\n      number of stationary troops, commanded by their respective\r\n      officers, and supplied with every kind of arms, from the new\r\n      arsenals which he had formed at Antioch, Emesa, and Damascus. 32\r\n      Nor was the precaution of the emperor less watchful against the\r\n      well-known valor of the barbarians of Europe. From the mouth of\r\n      the Rhine to that of the Danube, the ancient camps, towns, and\r\n      citidels, were diligently reëstablished, and, in the most exposed\r\n      places, new ones were skilfully constructed: the strictest\r\n      vigilance was introduced among the garrisons of the frontier, and\r\n      every expedient was practised that could render the long chain of\r\n      fortifications firm and impenetrable. 33 A barrier so respectable\r\n      was seldom violated, and the barbarians often turned against each\r\n      other their disappointed rage. The Goths, the Vandals, the\r\n      Gepidæ, the Burgundians, the Alemanni, wasted each other’s\r\n      strength by destructive hostilities: and whosoever vanquished,\r\n      they vanquished the enemies of Rome. The subjects of Diocletian\r\n      enjoyed the bloody spectacle, and congratulated each other, that\r\n      the mischiefs of civil war were now experienced only by the\r\n      barbarians. 34\r\n\r\n      32 (return) [ John Malala, in Chron, Antiochen. tom. i. p. 408,\r\n      409.]\r\n\r\n      33 (return) [ Zosim. l. i. p. 3.

Mamertinus illustrates the\r\n      fact by the example of almost all the nations in the world.]\r\n\r\n      Notwithstanding the policy of Diocletian, it was impossible to\r\n      maintain an equal and undisturbed tranquillity during a reign of\r\n      twenty years, and along a frontier of many hundred miles.\r\n      Sometimes the barbarians suspended their domestic animosities,\r\n      and the relaxed vigilance of the garrisons sometimes gave a\r\n      passage to their strength or dexterity. Whenever the provinces\r\n      were invaded, Diocletian conducted himself with that calm dignity\r\n      which he always affected or possessed; reserved his presence for\r\n      such occasions as were worthy of his interposition, never exposed\r\n      his person or reputation to any unnecessary danger, insured his\r\n      success by every means that prudence could suggest, and\r\n      displayed, with ostentation, the consequences of his victory. In\r\n      wars of a more difficult nature, and more doubtful event, he\r\n      employed the rough valor of Maximian; and that faithful soldier\r\n      was content to ascribe his own victories to the wise counsels and\r\n      auspicious influence of his benefactor. But after the adoption of\r\n      the two Cæsars, the emperors themselves, retiring to a less\r\n      laborious scene of action, devolved on their adopted sons the\r\n      defence of the Danube and of the Rhine. The vigilant Galerius was\r\n      never reduced to the necessity of vanquishing an army of\r\n      barbarians on the Roman territory. 35 The brave and active\r\n      Constantius delivered Gaul from a very furious inroad of the\r\n      Alemanni; and his victories of Langres and Vindonissa appear to\r\n      have been actions of considerable danger and merit. As he\r\n      traversed the open country with a feeble guard, he was\r\n      encompassed on a sudden by the superior multitude of the enemy.\r\n      He retreated with difficulty towards Langres; but, in the general\r\n      consternation, the citizens refused to open their gates, and the\r\n      wounded prince was drawn up the wall by the means of a rope. But,\r\n      on the news of his distress, the Roman troops hastened from all\r\n      sides to his relief, and before the evening he had satisfied his\r\n      honor and revenge by the slaughter of six thousand Alemanni. 36\r\n      From the monuments of those times, the obscure traces of several\r\n      other victories over the barbarians of Sarmatia and Germany might\r\n      possibly be collected; but the tedious search would not be\r\n      rewarded either with amusement or with instruction.\r\n\r\n      35 (return) [ He complained, though not with the strictest truth,\r\n      “Jam fluxisse annos quindecim in quibus, in Illyrico, ad ripam\r\n      Danubii relegatus cum gentibus barbaris luctaret.” Lactant. de M.\r\n      P. c. 18.]\r\n\r\n      36 (return) [ In the Greek text of Eusebius, we read six\r\n      thousand, a number which I have preferred to the sixty thousand\r\n      of Jerome, Orosius Eutropius, and his Greek translator Pæanius.]\r\n\r\n      The conduct which the emperor Probus had adopted in the disposal\r\n      of the vanquished was imitated by Diocletian and his associates.\r\n      The captive barbarians, exchanging death for slavery, were\r\n      distributed among the provincials, and assigned to those\r\n      districts (in Gaul, the territories of Amiens, Beauvais, Cambray,\r\n      Treves, Langres, and Troyes, are particularly specified) 37 which\r\n      had been depopulated by the calamities of war. They were usefully\r\n      employed as shepherds and husbandmen, but were denied the\r\n      exercise of arms, except when it was found expedient to enroll\r\n      them in the military service. Nor did the emperors refuse the\r\n      property of lands, with a less servile tenure, to such of the\r\n      barbarians as solicited the protection of Rome. They granted a\r\n      settlement to several colonies of the Carpi, the Bastarnæ, and\r\n      the Sarmatians; and, by a dangerous indulgence, permitted them in\r\n      some measure to retain their national manners and independence.\r\n      38 Among the provincials, it was a subject of flattering\r\n      exultation, that the barbarian, so lately an object of terror,\r\n      now cultivated their lands, drove their cattle to the neighboring\r\n      fair, and contributed by his labor to the public plenty. They\r\n      congratulated their masters on the powerful accession of subjects\r\n      and soldiers; but they forgot to observe, that multitudes of\r\n      secret enemies, insolent from favor, or desperate from\r\n      oppression, were introduced into the heart of the empire. 39\r\n\r\n      37 (return) [ Panegyr.

From the Nile to Mount\r\n      Atlas, Africa was in arms. A confederacy of five Moorish nations\r\n      issued from their deserts to invade the peaceful provinces. 40\r\n      Julian had assumed the purple at Carthage. 41 Achilleus at\r\n      Alexandria, and even the Blemmyes, renewed, or rather continued,\r\n      their incursions into the Upper Egypt. Scarcely any circumstances\r\n      have been preserved of the exploits of Maximian in the western\r\n      parts of Africa; but it appears, by the event, that the progress\r\n      of his arms was rapid and decisive, that he vanquished the\r\n      fiercest barbarians of Mauritania, and that he removed them from\r\n      the mountains, whose inaccessible strength had inspired their\r\n      inhabitants with a lawless confidence, and habituated them to a\r\n      life of rapine and violence. 42 Diocletian, on his side, opened\r\n      the campaign in Egypt by the siege of Alexandria, cut off the\r\n      aqueducts which conveyed the waters of the Nile into every\r\n      quarter of that immense city, 43 and rendering his camp\r\n      impregnable to the sallies of the besieged multitude, he pushed\r\n      his reiterated attacks with caution and vigor. After a siege of\r\n      eight months, Alexandria, wasted by the sword and by fire,\r\n      implored the clemency of the conqueror, but it experienced the\r\n      full extent of his severity. Many thousands of the citizens\r\n      perished in a promiscuous slaughter, and there were few obnoxious\r\n      persons in Egypt who escaped a sentence either of death or at\r\n      least of exile. 44 The fate of Busiris and of Coptos was still\r\n      more melancholy than that of Alexandria: those proud cities, the\r\n      former distinguished by its antiquity, the latter enriched by the\r\n      passage of the Indian trade, were utterly destroyed by the arms\r\n      and by the severe order of Diocletian. 45 The character of the\r\n      Egyptian nation, insensible to kindness, but extremely\r\n      susceptible of fear, could alone justify this excessive rigor.\r\n      The seditions of Alexandria had often affected the tranquillity\r\n      and subsistence of Rome itself. Since the usurpation of Firmus,\r\n      the province of Upper Egypt, incessantly relapsing into\r\n      rebellion, had embraced the alliance of the savages of Æthiopia.\r\n      The number of the Blemmyes, scattered between the Island of Meroe\r\n      and the Red Sea, was very inconsiderable, their disposition was\r\n      unwarlike, their weapons rude and inoffensive. 46 Yet in the\r\n      public disorders, these barbarians, whom antiquity, shocked with\r\n      the deformity of their figure, had almost excluded from the human\r\n      species, presumed to rank themselves among the enemies of Rome.\r\n      47 Such had been the unworthy allies of the Egyptians; and while\r\n      the attention of the state was engaged in more serious wars,\r\n      their vexations inroads might again harass the repose of the\r\n      province. With a view of opposing to the Blemmyes a suitable\r\n      adversary, Diocletian persuaded the Nobatæ, or people of Nubia,\r\n      to remove from their ancient habitations in the deserts of Libya,\r\n      and resigned to them an extensive but unprofitable territory\r\n      above Syene and the cataracts of the Nile, with the stipulation,\r\n      that they should ever respect and guard the frontier of the\r\n      empire. The treaty long subsisted; and till the establishment of\r\n      Christianity introduced stricter notions of religious worship, it\r\n      was annually ratified by a solemn sacrifice in the isle of\r\n      Elephantine, in which the Romans, as well as the barbarians,\r\n      adored the same visible or invisible powers of the universe. 48\r\n\r\n      40 (return) [ Scaliger (Animadvers. ad Euseb. p. 243) decides, in\r\n      his usual manner, that the Quinque gentiani, or five African\r\n      nations, were the five great cities, the Pentapolis of the\r\n      inoffensive province of Cyrene.]\r\n\r\n      41 (return) [ After his defeat, Julian stabbed himself with a\r\n      dagger, and immediately leaped into the flames.

He caused a diligent inquiry to be made “for all the\r\n      ancient books which treated of the admirable art of making gold\r\n      and silver, and without pity, committed them to the flames;\r\n      apprehensive, as we are assumed, lest the opulence of the\r\n      Egyptians should inspire them with confidence to rebel against\r\n      the empire.” 50 But if Diocletian had been convinced of the\r\n      reality of that valuable art, far from extinguishing the memory,\r\n      he would have converted the operation of it to the benefit of the\r\n      public revenue. It is much more likely, that his good sense\r\n      discovered to him the folly of such magnificent pretensions, and\r\n      that he was desirous of preserving the reason and fortunes of his\r\n      subjects from the mischievous pursuit. It may be remarked, that\r\n      these ancient books, so liberally ascribed to Pythagoras, to\r\n      Solomon, or to Hermes, were the pious frauds of more recent\r\n      adepts. The Greeks were inattentive either to the use or to the\r\n      abuse of chemistry. In that immense register, where Pliny has\r\n      deposited the discoveries, the arts, and the errors of mankind,\r\n      there is not the least mention of the transmutation of metals;\r\n      and the persecution of Diocletian is the first authentic event in\r\n      the history of alchemy. The conquest of Egypt by the Arabs\r\n      diffused that vain science over the globe. Congenial to the\r\n      avarice of the human heart, it was studied in China as in Europe,\r\n      with equal eagerness, and with equal success. The darkness of the\r\n      middle ages insured a favorable reception to every tale of\r\n      wonder, and the revival of learning gave new vigor to hope, and\r\n      suggested more specious arts of deception. Philosophy, with the\r\n      aid of experience, has at length banished the study of alchemy;\r\n      and the present age, however desirous of riches, is content to\r\n      seek them by the humbler means of commerce and industry. 51\r\n\r\n      49 (return) [ He fixed the public allowance of corn, for the\r\n      people of Alexandria, at two millions of medimni; about four\r\n      hundred thousand quarters.

It was reserved for the reign of Diocletian to vanquish that\r\n      powerful nation, and to extort a confession from the successors\r\n      of Artaxerxes, of the superior majesty of the Roman empire.\r\n\r\n      We have observed, under the reign of Valerian, that Armenia was\r\n      subdued by the perfidy and the arms of the Persians, and that,\r\n      after the assassination of Chosroes, his son Tiridates, the\r\n      infant heir of the monarchy, was saved by the fidelity of his\r\n      friends, and educated under the protection of the emperors.\r\n      Tiridates derived from his exile such advantages as he could\r\n      never have obtained on the throne of Armenia; the early knowledge\r\n      of adversity, of mankind, and of the Roman discipline. He\r\n      signalized his youth by deeds of valor, and displayed a matchless\r\n      dexterity, as well as strength, in every martial exercise, and\r\n      even in the less honorable contests of the Olympian games. 52\r\n      Those qualities were more nobly exerted in the defence of his\r\n      benefactor Licinius. 53 That officer, in the sedition which\r\n      occasioned the death of Probus, was exposed to the most imminent\r\n      danger, and the enraged soldiers were forcing their way into his\r\n      tent, when they were checked by the single arm of the Armenian\r\n      prince. The gratitude of Tiridates contributed soon afterwards to\r\n      his restoration. Licinius was in every station the friend and\r\n      companion of Galerius, and the merit of Galerius, long before he\r\n      was raised to the dignity of Cæsar, had been known and esteemed\r\n      by Diocletian. In the third year of that emperor’s reign\r\n      Tiridates was invested with the kingdom of Armenia. The justice\r\n      of the measure was not less evident than its expediency. It was\r\n      time to rescue from the usurpation of the Persian monarch an\r\n      important territory, which, since the reign of Nero, had been\r\n      always granted under the protection of the empire to a younger\r\n      branch of the house of Arsaces. 54\r\n\r\n      52 (return) [ See the education and strength of Tiridates in the\r\n      Armenian history of Moses of Chorene, l. ii. c. 76.

Hist.\r\n      Ecclesiast. l. x. c. 8,) that Licinius was at that time in the\r\n      last period of old age: sixteen years before, he is represented\r\n      with gray hairs, and as the contemporary of Galerius. See\r\n      Lactant. c. 32. Licinius was probably born about the year 250.]\r\n\r\n      54 (return) [ See the sixty-second and sixty-third books of Dion\r\n      Cassius.]\r\n\r\n      When Tiridates appeared on the frontiers of Armenia, he was\r\n      received with an unfeigned transport of joy and loyalty. During\r\n      twenty-six years, the country had experienced the real and\r\n      imaginary hardships of a foreign yoke. The Persian monarchs\r\n      adorned their new conquest with magnificent buildings; but those\r\n      monuments had been erected at the expense of the people, and were\r\n      abhorred as badges of slavery. The apprehension of a revolt had\r\n      inspired the most rigorous precautions: oppression had been\r\n      aggravated by insult, and the consciousness of the public hatred\r\n      had been productive of every measure that could render it still\r\n      more implacable. We have already remarked the intolerant spirit\r\n      of the Magian religion. The statues of the deified kings of\r\n      Armenia, and the sacred images of the sun and moon, were broke in\r\n      pieces by the zeal of the conqueror; and the perpetual fire of\r\n      Ormuzd was kindled and preserved upon an altar erected on the\r\n      summit of Mount Bagavan. 55 It was natural, that a people\r\n      exasperated by so many injuries, should arm with zeal in the\r\n      cause of their independence, their religion, and their hereditary\r\n      sovereign. The torrent bore down every obstacle, and the Persian\r\n      garrisons retreated before its fury. The nobles of Armenia flew\r\n      to the standard of Tiridates, all alleging their past merit,\r\n      offering their future service, and soliciting from the new king\r\n      those honors and rewards from which they had been excluded with\r\n      disdain under the foreign government. 56 The command of the army\r\n      was bestowed on Artavasdes, whose father had saved the infancy of\r\n      Tiridates, and whose family had been massacred for that generous\r\n      action. The brother of Artavasdes obtained the government of a\r\n      province. One of the first military dignities was conferred on\r\n      the satrap Otas, a man of singular temperance and fortitude, who\r\n      presented to the king his sister 57 and a considerable treasure,\r\n      both of which, in a sequestered fortress, Otas had preserved from\r\n      violation. Among the Armenian nobles appeared an ally, whose\r\n      fortunes are too remarkable to pass unnoticed. His name was\r\n      Mamgo, 571 his origin was Scythian, and the horde which\r\n      acknowledge his authority had encamped a very few years before on\r\n      the skirts of the Chinese empire, 58 which at that time extended\r\n      as far as the neighborhood of Sogdiana. 59 Having incurred the\r\n      displeasure of his master, Mamgo, with his followers, retired to\r\n      the banks of the Oxus, and implored the protection of Sapor. The\r\n      emperor of China claimed the fugitive, and alleged the rights of\r\n      sovereignty. The Persian monarch pleaded the laws of hospitality,\r\n      and with some difficulty avoided a war, by the promise that he\r\n      would banish Mamgo to the uttermost parts of the West, a\r\n      punishment, as he described it, not less dreadful than death\r\n      itself. Armenia was chosen for the place of exile, and a large\r\n      district was assigned to the Scythian horde, on which they might\r\n      feed their flocks and herds, and remove their encampment from one\r\n      place to another, according to the different seasons of the year.\r\n\r\n      They were employed to repel the invasion of Tiridates; but their\r\n      leader, after weighing the obligations and injuries which he had\r\n      received from the Persian monarch, resolved to abandon his party.\r\n\r\n      The Armenian prince, who was well acquainted with the merit as\r\n      well as power of Mamgo, treated him with distinguished respect;\r\n      and, by admitting him into his confidence, acquired a brave and\r\n      faithful servant, who contributed very effectually to his\r\n      restoration. 60\r\n\r\n      55 (return) [ Moses of Chorene.

He not only expelled the enemies of his family and\r\n      country from the whole extent of Armenia, but in the prosecution\r\n      of his revenge he carried his arms, or at least his incursions,\r\n      into the heart of Assyria.

Diocletian, with the calm\r\n      dignity which he constantly assumed, fixed his own station in the\r\n      city of Antioch, from whence he prepared and directed the\r\n      military operations. 63 The conduct of the legions was intrusted\r\n      to the intrepid valor of Galerius, who, for that important\r\n      purpose, was removed from the banks of the Danube to those of the\r\n      Euphrates. The armies soon encountered each other in the plains\r\n      of Mesopotamia, and two battles were fought with various and\r\n      doubtful success; but the third engagement was of a more decisive\r\n      nature; and the Roman army received a total overthrow, which is\r\n      attributed to the rashness of Galerius, who, with an\r\n      inconsiderable body of troops, attacked the innumerable host of\r\n      the Persians. 64 But the consideration of the country that was\r\n      the scene of action, may suggest another reason for his defeat.\r\n      The same ground on which Galerius was vanquished, had been\r\n      rendered memorable by the death of Crassus, and the slaughter of\r\n      ten legions. It was a plain of more than sixty miles, which\r\n      extended from the hills of Carrhæ to the Euphrates; a smooth and\r\n      barren surface of sandy desert, without a hillock, without a\r\n      tree, and without a spring of fresh water. 65 The steady infantry\r\n      of the Romans, fainting with heat and thirst, could neither hope\r\n      for victory if they preserved their ranks, nor break their ranks\r\n      without exposing themselves to the most imminent danger. In this\r\n      situation they were gradually encompassed by the superior\r\n      numbers, harassed by the rapid evolutions, and destroyed by the\r\n      arrows of the barbarian cavalry.\r\n\r\n      The king of Armenia had signalized his valor in the battle, and\r\n      acquired personal glory by the public misfortune. He was pursued\r\n      as far as the Euphrates; his horse was wounded, and it appeared\r\n      impossible for him to escape the victorious enemy. In this\r\n      extremity Tiridates embraced the only refuge which appeared\r\n      before him: he dismounted and plunged into the stream. His armor\r\n      was heavy, the river very deep, and at those parts at least half\r\n      a mile in breadth; 66 yet such was his strength and dexterity,\r\n      that he reached in safety the opposite bank. 67 With regard to\r\n      the Roman general, we are ignorant of the circumstances of his\r\n      escape; but when he returned to Antioch, Diocletian received him,\r\n      not with the tenderness of a friend and colleague, but with the\r\n      indignation of an offended sovereign. The haughtiest of men,\r\n      clothed in his purple, but humbled by the sense of his fault and\r\n      misfortune, was obliged to follow the emperor’s chariot above a\r\n      mile on foot, and to exhibit, before the whole court, the\r\n      spectacle of his disgrace. 68\r\n\r\n      63 (return) [ We may readily believe, that Lactantius ascribes to\r\n      cowardice the conduct of Diocletian.

The mile, in the hands\r\n      of Eutropoius, (ix. 24,) of Festus (c. 25,) and of Orosius, (vii\r\n      25), easily increased to several miles]\r\n\r\n      As soon as Diocletian had indulged his private resentment, and\r\n      asserted the majesty of supreme power, he yielded to the\r\n      submissive entreaties of the Cæsar, and permitted him to retrieve\r\n      his own honor, as well as that of the Roman arms. In the room of\r\n      the unwarlike troops of Asia, which had most probably served in\r\n      the first expedition, a second army was drawn from the veterans\r\n      and new levies of the Illyrian frontier, and a considerable body\r\n      of Gothic auxiliaries were taken into the Imperial pay. 69 At the\r\n      head of a chosen army of twenty-five thousand men, Galerius again\r\n      passed the Euphrates; but, instead of exposing his legions in the\r\n      open plains of Mesopotamia he advanced through the mountains of\r\n      Armenia, where he found the inhabitants devoted to his cause, and\r\n      the country as favorable to the operations of infantry as it was\r\n      inconvenient for the motions of cavalry. 70 Adversity had\r\n      confirmed the Roman discipline, while the barbarians, elated by\r\n      success, were become so negligent and remiss, that in the moment\r\n      when they least expected it, they were surprised by the active\r\n      conduct of Galerius, who, attended only by two horsemen, had with\r\n      his own eyes secretly examined the state and position of their\r\n      camp. A surprise, especially in the night time, was for the most\r\n      part fatal to a Persian army. “Their horses were tied, and\r\n      generally shackled, to prevent their running away; and if an\r\n      alarm happened, a Persian had his housing to fix, his horse to\r\n      bridle, and his corselet to put on, before he could mount.” 71 On\r\n      this occasion, the impetuous attack of Galerius spread disorder\r\n      and dismay over the camp of the barbarians. A slight resistance\r\n      was followed by a dreadful carnage, and, in the general\r\n      confusion, the wounded monarch (for Narses commanded his armies\r\n      in person) fled towards the deserts of Media. His sumptuous\r\n      tents, and those of his satraps, afforded an immense booty to the\r\n      conqueror; and an incident is mentioned, which proves the rustic\r\n      but martial ignorance of the legions in the elegant superfluities\r\n      of life. A bag of shining leather, filled with pearls, fell into\r\n      the hands of a private soldier; he carefully preserved the bag,\r\n      but he threw away its contents, judging that whatever was of no\r\n      use could not possibly be of any value. 72 The principal loss of\r\n      Narses was of a much more affecting nature. Several of his wives,\r\n      his sisters, and children, who had attended the army, were made\r\n      captives in the defeat. But though the character of Galerius had\r\n      in general very little affinity with that of Alexander, he\r\n      imitated, after his victory, the amiable behavior of the\r\n      Macedonian towards the family of Darius. The wives and children\r\n      of Narses were protected from violence and rapine, conveyed to a\r\n      place of safety, and treated with every mark of respect and\r\n      tenderness, that was due from a generous enemy to their age,\r\n      their sex, and their royal dignity. 73\r\n\r\n      69 (return) [ Aurelius Victor.

On the intelligence of the victory he\r\n      condescended to advance towards the frontier, with a view of\r\n      moderating, by his presence and counsels, the pride of Galerius.\r\n      The interview of the Roman princes at Nisibis was accompanied\r\n      with every expression of respect on one side, and of esteem on\r\n      the other. It was in that city that they soon afterwards gave\r\n      audience to the ambassador of the Great King. 74 The power, or at\r\n      least the spirit, of Narses, had been broken by his last defeat;\r\n      and he considered an immediate peace as the only means that could\r\n      stop the progress of the Roman arms. He despatched Apharban, a\r\n      servant who possessed his favor and confidence, with a commission\r\n      to negotiate a treaty, or rather to receive whatever conditions\r\n      the conqueror should impose. Apharban opened the conference by\r\n      expressing his master’s gratitude for the generous treatment of\r\n      his family, and by soliciting the liberty of those illustrious\r\n      captives. He celebrated the valor of Galerius, without degrading\r\n      the reputation of Narses, and thought it no dishonor to confess\r\n      the superiority of the victorious Cæsar, over a monarch who had\r\n      surpassed in glory all the princes of his race. Notwithstanding\r\n      the justice of the Persian cause, he was empowered to submit the\r\n      present differences to the decision of the emperors themselves;\r\n      convinced as he was, that, in the midst of prosperity, they would\r\n      not be unmindful of the vicissitudes of fortune. Apharban\r\n      concluded his discourse in the style of eastern allegory, by\r\n      observing that the Roman and Persian monarchies were the two eyes\r\n      of the world, which would remain imperfect and mutilated if\r\n      either of them should be put out.\r\n\r\n      74 (return) [ The account of the negotiation is taken from the\r\n      fragments of Peter the Patrician, in the Excerpta Legationum,\r\n      published in the Byzantine Collection. Peter lived under\r\n      Justinian; but it is very evident, by the nature of his\r\n      materials, that they are drawn from the most authentic and\r\n      respectable writers.]\r\n\r\n      “It well becomes the Persians,” replied Galerius, with a\r\n      transport of fury, which seemed to convulse his whole frame, “it\r\n      well becomes the Persians to expatiate on the vicissitudes of\r\n      fortune, and calmly to read us lectures on the virtues of\r\n      moderation. Let them remember their own _moderation_ towards the\r\n      unhappy Valerian. They vanquished him by fraud, they treated him\r\n      with indignity. They detained him till the last moment of his\r\n      life in shameful captivity, and after his death they exposed his\r\n      body to perpetual ignominy.” Softening, however, his tone,\r\n      Galerius insinuated to the ambassador, that it had never been the\r\n      practice of the Romans to trample on a prostrate enemy; and that,\r\n      on this occasion, they should consult their own dignity rather\r\n      than the Persian merit. He dismissed Apharban with a hope that\r\n      Narses would soon be informed on what conditions he might obtain,\r\n      from the clemency of the emperors, a lasting peace, and the\r\n      restoration of his wives and children. In this conference we may\r\n      discover the fierce passions of Galerius, as well as his\r\n      deference to the superior wisdom and authority of Diocletian. The\r\n      ambition of the former grasped at the conquest of the East, and\r\n      had proposed to reduce Persia into the state of a province. The\r\n      prudence of the latter, who adhered to the moderate policy of\r\n      Augustus and the Antonines, embraced the favorable opportunity of\r\n      terminating a successful war by an honorable and advantageous\r\n      peace. 75\r\n\r\n      75 (return) [ Adeo victor (says Aurelius) ut ni Valerius, cujus\r\n      nutu omnis gerebantur, abnuisset, Romani fasces in provinciam\r\n      novam ferrentur Verum pars terrarum tamen nobis utilior quæsita.]\r\n\r\n      In pursuance of their promise, the emperors soon afterwards\r\n      appointed Sicorius Probus, one of their secretaries, to acquaint\r\n      the Persian court with their final resolution. As the minister of\r\n      peace, he was received with every mark of politeness and\r\n      friendship; but, under the pretence of allowing him the necessary\r\n      repose after so long a journey, the audience of Probus was\r\n      deferred from day to day; and he attended the slow motions of the\r\n      king, till at length he was admitted to his presence, near the\r\n      River Asprudus in Media. The secret motive of Narses, in this\r\n      delay, had been to collect such a military force as might enable\r\n      him, though sincerely desirous of peace, to negotiate with the\r\n      greater weight and dignity. Three persons only assisted at this\r\n      important conference, the minister Apharban, the præfect of the\r\n      guards, and an officer who had commanded on the Armenian\r\n      frontier. 76 The first condition proposed by the ambassador is\r\n      not at present of a very intelligible nature; that the city of\r\n      Nisibis might be established for the place of mutual exchange,\r\n      or, as we should formerly have termed it, for the staple of\r\n      trade, between the two empires. There is no difficulty in\r\n      conceiving the intention of the Roman princes to improve their\r\n      revenue by some restraints upon commerce; but as Nisibis was\r\n      situated within their own dominions, and as they were masters\r\n      both of the imports and exports, it should seem that such\r\n      restraints were the objects of an internal law, rather than of a\r\n      foreign treaty. To render them more effectual, some stipulations\r\n      were probably required on the side of the king of Persia, which\r\n      appeared so very repugnant either to his interest or to his\r\n      dignity, that Narses could not be persuaded to subscribe them. As\r\n      this was the only article to which he refused his consent, it was\r\n      no longer insisted on; and the emperors either suffered the trade\r\n      to flow in its natural channels, or contented themselves with\r\n      such restrictions, as it depended on their own authority to\r\n      establish.\r\n\r\n      76 (return) [ He had been governor of Sumium, (Pot.

The conditions of\r\n      a treaty so glorious to the empire, and so necessary to Persia,\r\n      may deserve a more peculiar attention, as the history of Rome\r\n      presents very few transactions of a similar nature; most of her\r\n      wars having either been terminated by absolute conquest, or waged\r\n      against barbarians ignorant of the use of letters. I. The Aboras,\r\n      or, as it is called by Xenophon, the Araxes, was fixed as the\r\n      boundary between the two monarchies. 77 That river, which rose\r\n      near the Tigris, was increased, a few miles below Nisibis, by the\r\n      little stream of the Mygdonius, passed under the walls of\r\n      Singara, and fell into the Euphrates at Circesium, a frontier\r\n      town, which, by the care of Diocletian, was very strongly\r\n      fortified. 78 Mesopotomia, the object of so many wars, was ceded\r\n      to the empire; and the Persians, by this treaty, renounced all\r\n      pretensions to that great province. II. They relinquished to the\r\n      Romans five provinces beyond the Tigris. 79 Their situation\r\n      formed a very useful barrier, and their natural strength was soon\r\n      improved by art and military skill. Four of these, to the north\r\n      of the river, were districts of obscure fame and inconsiderable\r\n      extent; Intiline, Zabdicene, Arzanene, and Moxoene; 791 but on\r\n      the east of the Tigris, the empire acquired the large and\r\n      mountainous territory of Carduene, the ancient seat of the\r\n      Carduchians, who preserved for many ages their manly freedom in\r\n      the heart of the despotic monarchies of Asia. The ten thousand\r\n      Greeks traversed their country, after a painful march, or rather\r\n      engagement, of seven days; and it is confessed by their leader,\r\n      in his incomparable relation of the retreat, that they suffered\r\n      more from the arrows of the Carduchians, than from the power of\r\n      the Great King. 80 Their posterity, the Curds, with very little\r\n      alteration either of name or manners, 801 acknowledged the\r\n      nominal sovereignty of the Turkish sultan. III. It is almost\r\n      needless to observe, that Tiridates, the faithful ally of Rome,\r\n      was restored to the throne of his fathers, and that the rights of\r\n      the Imperial supremacy were fully asserted and secured. The\r\n      limits of Armenia were extended as far as the fortress of Sintha\r\n      in Media, and this increase of dominion was not so much an act of\r\n      liberality as of justice. Of the provinces already mentioned\r\n      beyond the Tigris, the four first had been dismembered by the\r\n      Parthians from the crown of Armenia; 81 and when the Romans\r\n      acquired the possession of them, they stipulated, at the expense\r\n      of the usurpers, an ample compensation, which invested their ally\r\n      with the extensive and fertile country of Atropatene. Its\r\n      principal city, in the same situation perhaps as the modern\r\n      Tauris, was frequently honored by the residence of Tiridates; and\r\n      as it sometimes bore the name of Ecbatana, he imitated, in the\r\n      buildings and fortifications, the splendid capital of the Medes.\r\n      82 IV. The country of Iberia was barren, its inhabitants rude and\r\n      savage. But they were accustomed to the use of arms, and they\r\n      separated from the empire barbarians much fiercer and more\r\n      formidable than themselves. The narrow defiles of Mount Caucasus\r\n      were in their hands, and it was in their choice, either to admit\r\n      or to exclude the wandering tribes of Sarmatia, whenever a\r\n      rapacious spirit urged them to penetrate into the richer climes\r\n      of the South. 83 The nomination of the kings of Iberia, which was\r\n      resigned by the Persian monarch to the emperors, contributed to\r\n      the strength and security of the Roman power in Asia. 84 The East\r\n      enjoyed a profound tranquillity during forty years; and the\r\n      treaty between the rival monarchies was strictly observed till\r\n      the death of Tiridates; when a new generation, animated with\r\n      different views and different passions, succeeded to the\r\n      government of the world; and the grandson of Narses undertook a\r\n      long and memorable war against the princes of the house of\r\n      Constantine.\r\n\r\n      77 (return) [ By an error of the geographer Ptolemy, the position\r\n      of Singara is removed from the Aboras to the Tigris, which may\r\n      have produced the mistake of Peter, in assigning the latter river\r\n      for the boundary, instead of the former. The line of the Roman\r\n      frontier traversed, but never followed, the course of the Tigris.\r\n      * Note: There are here several errors.

As soon as Diocletian entered into the\r\n      twentieth year of his reign, he celebrated that memorable æra, as\r\n      well as the success of his arms, by the pomp of a Roman triumph.\r\n      85 Maximian, the equal partner of his power, was his only\r\n      companion in the glory of that day. The two Cæsars had fought and\r\n      conquered, but the merit of their exploits was ascribed,\r\n      according to the rigor of ancient maxims, to the auspicious\r\n      influence of their fathers and emperors. 86 The triumph of\r\n      Diocletian and Maximian was less magnificent, perhaps, than those\r\n      of Aurelian and Probus, but it was dignified by several\r\n      circumstances of superior fame and good fortune. Africa and\r\n      Britain, the Rhine, the Danube, and the Nile, furnished their\r\n      respective trophies; but the most distinguished ornament was of a\r\n      more singular nature, a Persian victory followed by an important\r\n      conquest. The representations of rivers, mountains, and\r\n      provinces, were carried before the Imperial car. The images of\r\n      the captive wives, the sisters, and the children of the Great\r\n      King, afforded a new and grateful spectacle to the vanity of the\r\n      people. 87 In the eyes of posterity, this triumph is remarkable,\r\n      by a distinction of a less honorable kind. It was the last that\r\n      Rome ever beheld. Soon after this period, the emperors ceased to\r\n      vanquish, and Rome ceased to be the capital of the empire.\r\n\r\n      85 (return) [ Euseb. in Chron. Pagi ad annum.

As the persons had been restored to Narses, nothing more\r\n      than their images could be exhibited.]\r\n\r\n      The spot on which Rome was founded had been consecrated by\r\n      ancient ceremonies and imaginary miracles. The presence of some\r\n      god, or the memory of some hero, seemed to animate every part of\r\n      the city, and the empire of the world had been promised to the\r\n      Capitol. 88 The native Romans felt and confessed the power of\r\n      this agreeable illusion. It was derived from their ancestors, had\r\n      grown up with their earliest habits of life, and was protected,\r\n      in some measure, by the opinion of political utility. The form\r\n      and the seat of government were intimately blended together, nor\r\n      was it esteemed possible to transport the one without destroying\r\n      the other. 89 But the sovereignty of the capital was gradually\r\n      annihilated in the extent of conquest; the provinces rose to the\r\n      same level, and the vanquished nations acquired the name and\r\n      privileges, without imbibing the partial affections, of Romans.\r\n      During a long period, however, the remains of the ancient\r\n      constitution, and the influence of custom, preserved the dignity\r\n      of Rome. The emperors, though perhaps of African or Illyrian\r\n      extraction, respected their adopted country, as the seat of their\r\n      power, and the centre of their extensive dominions. The\r\n      emergencies of war very frequently required their presence on the\r\n      frontiers; but Diocletian and Maximian were the first Roman\r\n      princes who fixed, in time of peace, their ordinary residence in\r\n      the provinces; and their conduct, however it might be suggested\r\n      by private motives, was justified by very specious considerations\r\n      of policy. The court of the emperor of the West was, for the most\r\n      part, established at Milan, whose situation, at the foot of the\r\n      Alps, appeared far more convenient than that of Rome, for the\r\n      important purpose of watching the motions of the barbarians of\r\n      Germany. Milan soon assumed the splendor of an Imperial city. The\r\n      houses are described as numerous and well built; the manners of\r\n      the people as polished and liberal. A circus, a theatre, a mint,\r\n      a palace, baths, which bore the name of their founder Maximian;\r\n      porticos adorned with statues, and a double circumference of\r\n      walls, contributed to the beauty of the new capital; nor did it\r\n      seem oppressed even by the proximity of Rome. 90 To rival the\r\n      majesty of Rome was the ambition likewise of Diocletian, who\r\n      employed his leisure, and the wealth of the East, in the\r\n      embellishment of Nicomedia, a city placed on the verge of Europe\r\n      and Asia, almost at an equal distance between the Danube and the\r\n      Euphrates. By the taste of the monarch, and at the expense of the\r\n      people, Nicomedia acquired, in the space of a few years, a degree\r\n      of magnificence which might appear to have required the labor of\r\n      ages, and became inferior only to Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch,\r\n      in extent of populousness. 91 The life of Diocletian and Maximian\r\n      was a life of action, and a considerable portion of it was spent\r\n      in camps, or in the long and frequent marches; but whenever the\r\n      public business allowed them any relaxation, they seemed to have\r\n      retired with pleasure to their favorite residences of Nicomedia\r\n      and Milan. Till Diocletian, in the twentieth year of his reign,\r\n      celebrated his Roman triumph, it is extremely doubtful whether he\r\n      ever visited the ancient capital of the empire. Even on that\r\n      memorable occasion his stay did not exceed two months. Disgusted\r\n      with the licentious familiarity of the people, he quitted Rome\r\n      with precipitation thirteen days before it was expected that he\r\n      should have appeared in the senate, invested with the ensigns of\r\n      the consular dignity. 92\r\n\r\n      88 (return) [ Livy gives us a speech of Camillus on that subject,\r\n      (v. 51—55,) full of eloquence and sensibility, in opposition to a\r\n      design of removing the seat of government from Rome to the\r\n      neighboring city of Veii.]\r\n\r\n      89 (return) [ Julius Cæsar was reproached with the intention of\r\n      removing the empire to Ilium or Alexandria.

On a similar occasion,\r\n      Ammianus mentions the dicacitas plebis, as not very agreeable to\r\n      an Imperial ear. (See l. xvi. c. 10.)]\r\n\r\n      The dislike expressed by Diocletian towards Rome and Roman\r\n      freedom was not the effect of momentary caprice, but the result\r\n      of the most artful policy. That crafty prince had framed a new\r\n      system of Imperial government, which was afterwards completed by\r\n      the family of Constantine; and as the image of the old\r\n      constitution was religiously preserved in the senate, he resolved\r\n      to deprive that order of its small remains of power and\r\n      consideration. We may recollect, about eight years before the\r\n      elevation of Diocletian, the transient greatness, and the\r\n      ambitious hopes, of the Roman senate. As long as that enthusiasm\r\n      prevailed, many of the nobles imprudently displayed their zeal in\r\n      the cause of freedom; and after the successes of Probus had\r\n      withdrawn their countenance from the republican party, the\r\n      senators were unable to disguise their impotent resentment.\r\n\r\n      As the sovereign of Italy, Maximian was intrusted with the care\r\n      of extinguishing this troublesome, rather than dangerous spirit,\r\n      and the task was perfectly suited to his cruel temper. The most\r\n      illustrious members of the senate, whom Diocletian always\r\n      affected to esteem, were involved, by his colleague, in the\r\n      accusation of imaginary plots; and the possession of an elegant\r\n      villa, or a well-cultivated estate, was interpreted as a\r\n      convincing evidence of guilt. 93 The camp of the Prætorians,\r\n      which had so long oppressed, began to protect, the majesty of\r\n      Rome; and as those haughty troops were conscious of the decline\r\n      of their power, they were naturally disposed to unite their\r\n      strength with the authority of the senate. By the prudent\r\n      measures of Diocletian, the numbers of the Prætorians were\r\n      insensibly reduced, their privileges abolished, 94 and their\r\n      place supplied by two faithful legions of Illyricum, who, under\r\n      the new titles of Jovians and Herculians, were appointed to\r\n      perform the service of the Imperial guards. 95 But the most fatal\r\n      though secret wound, which the senate received from the hands of\r\n      Diocletian and Maximian, was inflicted by the inevitable\r\n      operation of their absence. As long as the emperors resided at\r\n      Rome, that assembly might be oppressed, but it could scarcely be\r\n      neglected. The successors of Augustus exercised the power of\r\n      dictating whatever laws their wisdom or caprice might suggest;\r\n      but those laws were ratified by the sanction of the senate. The\r\n      model of ancient freedom was preserved in its deliberations and\r\n      decrees; and wise princes, who respected the prejudices of the\r\n      Roman people, were in some measure obliged to assume the language\r\n      and behavior suitable to the general and first magistrate of the\r\n      republic. In the armies and in the provinces, they displayed the\r\n      dignity of monarchs; and when they fixed their residence at a\r\n      distance from the capital, they forever laid aside the\r\n      dissimulation which Augustus had recommended to his successors.\r\n      In the exercise of the legislative as well as the executive\r\n      power, the sovereign advised with his ministers, instead of\r\n      consulting the great council of the nation. The name of the\r\n      senate was mentioned with honor till the last period of the\r\n      empire; the vanity of its members was still flattered with\r\n      honorary distinctions; 96 but the assembly which had so long been\r\n      the source, and so long the instrument of power, was respectfully\r\n      suffered to sink into oblivion. The senate of Rome, losing all\r\n      connection with the Imperial court and the actual constitution,\r\n      was left a venerable but useless monument of antiquity on the\r\n      Capitoline hill.\r\n\r\n      93 (return) [ Lactantius accuses Maximian of destroying fictis\r\n      criminationibus lumina senatus, (De M.

The civil offices of consul, of proconsul, of\r\n      censor, and of tribune, by the union of which it had been formed,\r\n      betrayed to the people its republican extraction. Those modest\r\n      titles were laid aside; 97 and if they still distinguished their\r\n      high station by the appellation of Emperor, or Imperator, that\r\n      word was understood in a new and more dignified sense, and no\r\n      longer denoted the general of the Roman armies, but the sovereign\r\n      of the Roman world. The name of Emperor, which was at first of a\r\n      military nature, was associated with another of a more servile\r\n      kind. The epithet of Dominus, or Lord, in its primitive\r\n      signification, was expressive not of the authority of a prince\r\n      over his subjects, or of a commander over his soldiers, but of\r\n      the despotic power of a master over his domestic slaves. 98\r\n      Viewing it in that odious light, it had been rejected with\r\n      abhorrence by the first Cæsars. Their resistance insensibly\r\n      became more feeble, and the name less odious; till at length the\r\n      style of _our Lord and Emperor_ was not only bestowed by\r\n      flattery, but was regularly admitted into the laws and public\r\n      monuments. Such lofty epithets were sufficient to elate and\r\n      satisfy the most excessive vanity; and if the successors of\r\n      Diocletian still declined the title of King, it seems to have\r\n      been the effect not so much of their moderation as of their\r\n      delicacy. Wherever the Latin tongue was in use, (and it was the\r\n      language of government throughout the empire,) the Imperial\r\n      title, as it was peculiar to themselves, conveyed a more\r\n      respectable idea than the name of king, which they must have\r\n      shared with a hundred barbarian chieftains; or which, at the\r\n      best, they could derive only from Romulus, or from Tarquin. But\r\n      the sentiments of the East were very different from those of the\r\n      West. From the earliest period of history, the sovereigns of Asia\r\n      had been celebrated in the Greek language by the title of\r\n      Basileus, or King; and since it was considered as the first\r\n      distinction among men, it was soon employed by the servile\r\n      provincials of the East, in their humble addresses to the Roman\r\n      throne. 99 Even the attributes, or at least the titles, of the\r\n      DIVINITY, were usurped by Diocletian and Maximian, who\r\n      transmitted them to a succession of Christian emperors. 100 Such\r\n      extravagant compliments, however, soon lose their impiety by\r\n      losing their meaning; and when the ear is once accustomed to the\r\n      sound, they are heard with indifference, as vague though\r\n      excessive professions of respect.\r\n\r\n      97 (return) [ See the 12th dissertation in Spanheim’s excellent\r\n      work de Usu Numismatum.

According to\r\n      Tillemont, Gregory Nazianzen complains most bitterly of the\r\n      profanation, especially when it was practised by an Arian\r\n      emperor. * Note: In the time of the republic, says Hegewisch,\r\n      when the consuls, the prætors, and the other magistrates appeared\r\n      in public, to perform the functions of their office, their\r\n      dignity was announced both by the symbols which use had\r\n      consecrated, and the brilliant cortege by which they were\r\n      accompanied. But this dignity belonged to the office, not to the\r\n      individual; this pomp belonged to the magistrate, not to the man.\r\n      * * The consul, followed, in the comitia, by all the senate, the\r\n      prætors, the quæstors, the ædiles, the lictors, the apparitors,\r\n      and the heralds, on reentering his house, was served only by\r\n      freedmen and by his slaves. The first emperors went no further.\r\n      Tiberius had, for his personal attendance, only a moderate number\r\n      of slaves, and a few freedmen. (Tacit. Ann. iv. 7.) But in\r\n      proportion as the republican forms disappeared, one after\r\n      another, the inclination of the emperors to environ themselves\r\n      with personal pomp, displayed itself more and more. ** The\r\n      magnificence and the ceremonial of the East were entirely\r\n      introduced by Diocletian, and were consecrated by Constantine to\r\n      the Imperial use. Thenceforth the palace, the court, the table,\r\n      all the personal attendance, distinguished the emperor from his\r\n      subjects, still more than his superior dignity. The organization\r\n      which Diocletian gave to his new court, attached less honor and\r\n      distinction to rank than to services performed towards the\r\n      members of the Imperial family.

Few historians have characterized, in a more\r\n      philosophic manner, the influence of a new institution.—G.——It is\r\n      singular that the son of a slave reduced the haughty aristocracy\r\n      of Home to the offices of servitude.—M.]\r\n\r\n      From the time of Augustus to that of Diocletian, the Roman\r\n      princes, conversing in a familiar manner among their\r\n      fellow-citizens, were saluted only with the same respect that was\r\n      usually paid to senators and magistrates. Their principal\r\n      distinction was the Imperial or military robe of purple; whilst\r\n      the senatorial garment was marked by a broad, and the equestrian\r\n      by a narrow, band or stripe of the same honorable color. The\r\n      pride, or rather the policy, of Diocletian engaged that artful\r\n      prince to introduce the stately magnificence of the court of\r\n      Persia. 101 He ventured to assume the diadem, an ornament\r\n      detested by the Romans as the odious ensign of royalty, and the\r\n      use of which had been considered as the most desperate act of the\r\n      madness of Caligula. It was no more than a broad white fillet set\r\n      with pearls, which encircled the emperor’s head. The sumptuous\r\n      robes of Diocletian and his successors were of silk and gold; and\r\n      it is remarked with indignation that even their shoes were\r\n      studded with the most precious gems. The access to their sacred\r\n      person was every day rendered more difficult by the institution\r\n      of new forms and ceremonies. The avenues of the palace were\r\n      strictly guarded by the various schools, as they began to be\r\n      called, of domestic officers. The interior apartments were\r\n      intrusted to the jealous vigilance of the eunuchs, the increase\r\n      of whose numbers and influence was the most infallible symptom of\r\n      the progress of despotism. When a subject was at length admitted\r\n      to the Imperial presence, he was obliged, whatever might be his\r\n      rank, to fall prostrate on the ground, and to adore, according to\r\n      the eastern fashion, the divinity of his lord and master. 102\r\n      Diocletian was a man of sense, who, in the course of private as\r\n      well as public life, had formed a just estimate both of himself\r\n      and of mankind; nor is it easy to conceive that in substituting\r\n      the manners of Persia to those of Rome he was seriously actuated\r\n      by so mean a principle as that of vanity. He flattered himself\r\n      that an ostentation of splendor and luxury would subdue the\r\n      imagination of the multitude; that the monarch would be less\r\n      exposed to the rude license of the people and the soldiers, as\r\n      his person was secluded from the public view; and that habits of\r\n      submission would insensibly be productive of sentiments of\r\n      veneration. Like the modesty affected by Augustus, the state\r\n      maintained by Diocletian was a theatrical representation; but it\r\n      must be confessed, that of the two comedies, the former was of a\r\n      much more liberal and manly character than the latter. It was the\r\n      aim of the one to disguise, and the object of the other to\r\n      display, the unbounded power which the emperors possessed over\r\n      the Roman world.\r\n\r\n      101 (return) [ See Spanheim de Usu Numismat. Dissert. xii.]\r\n\r\n      102 (return) [ Aurelius Victor. Eutropius, ix. 26. It appears by\r\n      the Panegyrists, that the Romans were soon reconciled to the name\r\n      and ceremony of adoration.]\r\n\r\n      Ostentation was the first principle of the new system instituted\r\n      by Diocletian. The second was division. He divided the empire,\r\n      the provinces, and every branch of the civil as well as military\r\n      administration. He multiplied the wheels of the machine of\r\n      government, and rendered its operations less rapid, but more\r\n      secure. Whatever advantages and whatever defects might attend\r\n      these innovations, they must be ascribed in a very great degree\r\n      to the first inventor; but as the new frame of policy was\r\n      gradually improved and completed by succeeding princes, it will\r\n      be more satisfactory to delay the consideration of it till the\r\n      season of its full maturity and perfection. 103 Reserving,\r\n      therefore, for the reign of Constantine a more exact picture of\r\n      the new empire, we shall content ourselves with describing the\r\n      principal and decisive outline, as it was traced by the hand of\r\n      Diocletian. He had associated three colleagues in the exercise of\r\n      the supreme power; and as he was convinced that the abilities of\r\n      a single man were inadequate to the public defence, he considered\r\n      the joint administration of four princes not as a temporary\r\n      expedient, but as a fundamental law of the constitution. It was\r\n      his intention that the two elder princes should be distinguished\r\n      by the use of the diadem, and the title of _Augusti;_ that, as\r\n      affection or esteem might direct their choice, they should\r\n      regularly call to their assistance two subordinate colleagues;\r\n      and that the _Cæsars_, rising in their turn to the first rank,\r\n      should supply an uninterrupted succession of emperors. The empire\r\n      was divided into four parts. The East and Italy were the most\r\n      honorable, the Danube and the Rhine the most laborious stations.\r\n      The former claimed the presence of the _Augusti_, the latter were\r\n      intrusted to the administration of the _Cæsars_. The strength of\r\n      the legions was in the hands of the four partners of sovereignty,\r\n      and the despair of successively vanquishing four formidable\r\n      rivals might intimidate the ambition of an aspiring general. In\r\n      their civil government the emperors were supposed to exercise the\r\n      undivided power of the monarch, and their edicts, inscribed with\r\n      their joint names, were received in all the provinces, as\r\n      promulgated by their mutual councils and authority.\r\n      Notwithstanding these precautions, the political union of the\r\n      Roman world was gradually dissolved, and a principle of division\r\n      was introduced, which, in the course of a few years, occasioned\r\n      the perpetual separation of the Eastern and Western Empires.\r\n\r\n      103 (return) [ The innovations introduced by Diocletian are\r\n      chiefly deduced, 1st, from some very strong passages in\r\n      Lactantius; and, 2dly, from the new and various offices which, in\r\n      the Theodosian code, appear already established in the beginning\r\n      of the reign of Constantine.]\r\n\r\n      The system of Diocletian was accompanied with another very\r\n      material disadvantage, which cannot even at present be totally\r\n      overlooked; a more expensive establishment, and consequently an\r\n      increase of taxes, and the oppression of the people. Instead of a\r\n      modest family of slaves and freedmen, such as had contented the\r\n      simple greatness of Augustus and Trajan, three or four\r\n      magnificent courts were established in the various parts of the\r\n      empire, and as many Roman _kings_ contended with each other and\r\n      with the Persian monarch for the vain superiority of pomp and\r\n      luxury. The number of ministers, of magistrates, of officers, and\r\n      of servants, who filled the different departments of the state,\r\n      was multiplied beyond the example of former times; and (if we may\r\n      borrow the warm expression of a contemporary) “when the\r\n      proportion of those who received exceeded the proportion of those\r\n      who contributed, the provinces were oppressed by the weight of\r\n      tributes.” 104 From this period to the extinction of the empire,\r\n      it would be easy to deduce an uninterrupted series of clamors and\r\n      complaints. According to his religion and situation, each writer\r\n      chooses either Diocletian, or Constantine, or Valens, or\r\n      Theodosius, for the object of his invectives; but they\r\n      unanimously agree in representing the burden of the public\r\n      impositions, and particularly the land tax and capitation, as the\r\n      intolerable and increasing grievance of their own times. From\r\n      such a concurrence, an impartial historian, who is obliged to\r\n      extract truth from satire, as well as from panegyric, will be\r\n      inclined to divide the blame among the princes whom they accuse,\r\n      and to ascribe their exactions much less to their personal vices,\r\n      than to the uniform system of their administration. 1041 The\r\n      emperor Diocletian was indeed the author of that system; but\r\n      during his reign, the growing evil was confined within the bounds\r\n      of modesty and discretion, and he deserves the reproach of\r\n      establishing pernicious precedents, rather than of exercising\r\n      actual oppression. 105 It may be added, that his revenues were\r\n      managed with prudent economy; and that after all the current\r\n      expenses were discharged, there still remained in the Imperial\r\n      treasury an ample provision either for judicious liberality or\r\n      for any emergency of the state.\r\n\r\n      104 (return) [ Lactant. de M.

Leake. This inscription was first copied\r\n      by Sherard, afterwards much more completely by Mr. Bankes. It is\r\n      confirmed and illustrated by a more imperfect copy of the same\r\n      edict, found in the Levant by a gentleman of Aix, and brought to\r\n      this country by M. Vescovali. This edict was issued in the name\r\n      of the four Cæsars, Diocletian, Maximian, Constantius, and\r\n      Galerius. It fixed a maximum of prices throughout the empire, for\r\n      all the necessaries and commodities of life. The preamble\r\n      insists, with great vehemence on the extortion and inhumanity of\r\n      the venders and merchants. Quis enim adeo obtunisi (obtusi)\r\n      pectores (is) et a sensu inhumanitatis extorris est qui ignorare\r\n      potest immo non senserit in venalibus rebus quævel in mercimoniis\r\n      aguntur vel diurna urbium conversatione tractantur, in tantum se\r\n      licen liam defusisse, ut effrænata libido rapien—rum copia nec\r\n      annorum ubertatibus mitigaretur. The edict, as Col. Leake clearly\r\n      shows, was issued A. C. 303. Among the articles of which the\r\n      maximum value is assessed, are oil, salt, honey, butchers’ meat,\r\n      poultry, game, fish, vegetables, fruit the wages of laborers and\r\n      artisans, schoolmasters and skins, boots and shoes, harness,\r\n      timber, corn, wine, and beer, (zythus.) The depreciation in the\r\n      value of money, or the rise in the price of commodities, had been\r\n      so great during the past century, that butchers’ meat, which, in\r\n      the second century of the empire, was in Rome about two denaril\r\n      the pound, was now fixed at a maximum of eight. Col. Leake\r\n      supposes the average price could not be less than four: at the\r\n      same time the maximum of the wages of the agricultural laborers\r\n      was twenty-five. The whole edict is, perhaps, the most gigantic\r\n      effort of a blind though well-intentioned despotism, to control\r\n      that which is, and ought to be, beyond the regulation of the\r\n      government.

Diocletian acquired the glory of giving to the\r\n      world the first example of a resignation, 106 which has not been\r\n      very frequently imitated by succeeding monarchs. The parallel of\r\n      Charles the Fifth, however, will naturally offer itself to our\r\n      mind, not only since the eloquence of a modern historian has\r\n      rendered that name so familiar to an English reader, but from the\r\n      very striking resemblance between the characters of the two\r\n      emperors, whose political abilities were superior to their\r\n      military genius, and whose specious virtues were much less the\r\n      effect of nature than of art. The abdication of Charles appears\r\n      to have been hastened by the vicissitudes of fortune; and the\r\n      disappointment of his favorite schemes urged him to relinquish a\r\n      power which he found inadequate to his ambition. But the reign of\r\n      Diocletian had flowed with a tide of uninterrupted success; nor\r\n      was it till after he had vanquished all his enemies, and\r\n      accomplished all his designs, that he seems to have entertained\r\n      any serious thoughts of resigning the empire. Neither Charles nor\r\n      Diocletian were arrived at a very advanced period of life; since\r\n      the one was only fifty-five, and the other was no more than\r\n      fifty-nine years of age; but the active life of those princes,\r\n      their wars and journeys, the cares of royalty, and their\r\n      application to business, had already impaired their constitution,\r\n      and brought on the infirmities of a premature old age. 107\r\n\r\n      106 (return) [ Solus omnium post conditum Romanum Imperium, qui\r\n      extanto fastigio sponte ad privatæ vitæ statum civilitatemque\r\n      remearet, Eutrop. ix. 28.]\r\n\r\n      107 (return) [ The particulars of the journey and illness are\r\n      taken from Laclantius, c. 17, who may sometimes be admitted as an\r\n      evidence of public facts, though very seldom of private\r\n      anecdotes.]\r\n\r\n      Notwithstanding the severity of a very cold and rainy winter,\r\n      Diocletian left Italy soon after the ceremony of his triumph, and\r\n      began his progress towards the East round the circuit of the\r\n      Illyrian provinces. From the inclemency of the weather, and the\r\n      fatigue of the journey, he soon contracted a slow illness; and\r\n      though he made easy marches, and was generally carried in a close\r\n      litter, his disorder, before he arrived at Nicomedia, about the\r\n      end of the summer, was become very serious and alarming. During\r\n      the whole winter he was confined to his palace: his danger\r\n      inspired a general and unaffected concern; but the people could\r\n      only judge of the various alterations of his health, from the joy\r\n      or consternation which they discovered in the countenances and\r\n      behavior of his attendants. The rumor of his death was for some\r\n      time universally believed, and it was supposed to be concealed\r\n      with a view to prevent the troubles that might have happened\r\n      during the absence of the Cæsar Galerius. At length, however, on\r\n      the first of March, Diocletian once more appeared in public, but\r\n      so pale and emaciated, that he could scarcely have been\r\n      recognized by those to whom his person was the most familiar. It\r\n      was time to put an end to the painful struggle, which he had\r\n      sustained during more than a year, between the care of his health\r\n      and that of his dignity. The former required indulgence and\r\n      relaxation, the latter compelled him to direct, from the bed of\r\n      sickness, the administration of a great empire. He resolved to\r\n      pass the remainder of his days in honorable repose, to place his\r\n      glory beyond the reach of fortune, and to relinquish the theatre\r\n      of the world to his younger and more active associates. 108\r\n\r\n      108 (return) [ Aurelius Victor ascribes the abdication, which had\r\n      been so variously accounted for, to two causes: 1st, Diocletian’s\r\n      contempt of ambition; and 2dly, His apprehension of impending\r\n      troubles. One of the panegyrists (vi. 9) mentions the age and\r\n      infirmities of Diocletian as a very natural reason for his\r\n      retirement. * Note: Constantine (Orat. ad Sanct. c. 401) more\r\n      than insinuated that derangement of mind, connected with the\r\n      conflagration of the palace at Nicomedia by lightning, was the\r\n      cause of his abdication. But Heinichen. in a very sensible note\r\n      on this passage in Eusebius, while he admits that his long\r\n      illness might produce a temporary depression of spirits,\r\n      triumphantly appeals to the philosophical conduct of Diocletian\r\n      in his retreat, and the influence which he still retained on\r\n      public affairs.—M.]\r\n\r\n      The ceremony of his abdication was performed in a spacious plain,\r\n      about three miles from Nicomedia. The emperor ascended a lofty\r\n      throne, and in a speech, full of reason and dignity, declared his\r\n      intention, both to the people and to the soldiers who were\r\n      assembled on this extraordinary occasion. As soon as he had\r\n      divested himself of his purple, he withdrew from the gazing\r\n      multitude; and traversing the city in a covered chariot,\r\n      proceeded, without delay, to the favorite retirement which he had\r\n      chosen in his native country of Dalmatia. On the same day, which\r\n      was the first of May, 109 Maximian, as it had been previously\r\n      concerted, made his resignation of the Imperial dignity at Milan.\r\n\r\n      Even in the splendor of the Roman triumph, Diocletian had\r\n      meditated his design of abdicating the government. As he wished\r\n      to secure the obedience of Maximian, he exacted from him either a\r\n      general assurance that he would submit his actions to the\r\n      authority of his benefactor, or a particular promise that he\r\n      would descend from the throne, whenever he should receive the\r\n      advice and the example. This engagement, though it was confirmed\r\n      by the solemnity of an oath before the altar of the Capitoline\r\n      Jupiter, 110 would have proved a feeble restraint on the fierce\r\n      temper of Maximian, whose passion was the love of power, and who\r\n      neither desired present tranquility nor future reputation. But he\r\n      yielded, however reluctantly, to the ascendant which his wiser\r\n      colleague had acquired over him, and retired, immediately after\r\n      his abdication, to a villa in Lucania, where it was almost\r\n      impossible that such an impatient spirit could find any lasting\r\n      tranquility.\r\n\r\n      109 (return) [ The difficulties as well as mistakes attending the\r\n      dates both of the year and of the day of Diocletian’s abdication\r\n      are perfectly cleared up by Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom.\r\n      iv. p 525, note 19, and by Pagi ad annum.]\r\n\r\n      110 (return) [ See Panegyr. Veter. vi. 9. The oration was\r\n      pronounced after Maximian had resumed the purple.]\r\n\r\n      Diocletian, who, from a servile origin, had raised himself to the\r\n      throne, passed the nine last years of his life in a private\r\n      condition. Reason had dictated, and content seems to have\r\n      accompanied, his retreat, in which he enjoyed, for a long time,\r\n      the respect of those princes to whom he had resigned the\r\n      possession of the world. 111 It is seldom that minds long\r\n      exercised in business have formed any habits of conversing with\r\n      themselves, and in the loss of power they principally regret the\r\n      want of occupation. The amusements of letters and of devotion,\r\n      which afford so many resources in solitude, were incapable of\r\n      fixing the attention of Diocletian; but he had preserved, or at\r\n      least he soon recovered, a taste for the most innocent as well as\r\n      natural pleasures, and his leisure hours were sufficiently\r\n      employed in building, planting, and gardening. His answer to\r\n      Maximian is deservedly celebrated. He was solicited by that\r\n      restless old man to reassume the reins of government, and the\r\n      Imperial purple. He rejected the temptation with a smile of pity,\r\n      calmly observing, that if he could show Maximian the cabbages\r\n      which he had planted with his own hands at Salona, he should no\r\n      longer be urged to relinquish the enjoyment of happiness for the\r\n      pursuit of power. 112 In his conversations with his friends, he\r\n      frequently acknowledged, that of all arts, the most difficult was\r\n      the art of reigning; and he expressed himself on that favorite\r\n      topic with a degree of warmth which could be the result only of\r\n      experience. “How often,” was he accustomed to say, “is it the\r\n      interest of four or five ministers to combine together to deceive\r\n      their sovereign! Secluded from mankind by his exalted dignity,\r\n      the truth is concealed from his knowledge; he can see only with\r\n      their eyes, he hears nothing but their misrepresentations. He\r\n      confers the most important offices upon vice and weakness, and\r\n      disgraces the most virtuous and deserving among his subjects. By\r\n      such infamous arts,” added Diocletian, “the best and wisest\r\n      princes are sold to the venal corruption of their courtiers.” 113\r\n      A just estimate of greatness, and the assurance of immortal fame,\r\n      improve our relish for the pleasures of retirement; but the Roman\r\n      emperor had filled too important a character in the world, to\r\n      enjoy without alloy the comforts and security of a private\r\n      condition. It was impossible that he could remain ignorant of the\r\n      troubles which afflicted the empire after his abdication. It was\r\n      impossible that he could be indifferent to their consequences.\r\n      Fear, sorrow, and discontent, sometimes pursued him into the\r\n      solitude of Salona. His tenderness, or at least his pride, was\r\n      deeply wounded by the misfortunes of his wife and daughter; and\r\n      the last moments of Diocletian were imbittered by some affronts,\r\n      which Licinius and Constantine might have spared the father of so\r\n      many emperors, and the first author of their own fortune. A\r\n      report, though of a very doubtful nature, has reached our times,\r\n      that he prudently withdrew himself from their power by a\r\n      voluntary death. 114\r\n\r\n      111 (return) [ Eumenius pays him a very fine compliment: “At enim\r\n      divinum illum virum, qui primus imperium et participavit et\r\n      posuit, consilii et fact isui non poenitet; nec amisisse se putat\r\n      quod sponte transcripsit.

It\r\n      has been affirmed that he died raving mad, that he was condemned\r\n      as a criminal by the Roman senate, &c.]\r\n\r\n      Before we dismiss the consideration of the life and character of\r\n      Diocletian, we may, for a moment, direct our view to the place of\r\n      his retirement. Salona, a principal city of his native province\r\n      of Dalmatia, was near two hundred Roman miles (according to the\r\n      measurement of the public highways) from Aquileia and the\r\n      confines of Italy, and about two hundred and seventy from\r\n      Sirmium, the usual residence of the emperors whenever they\r\n      visited the Illyrian frontier. 115 A miserable village still\r\n      preserves the name of Salona; but so late as the sixteenth\r\n      century, the remains of a theatre, and a confused prospect of\r\n      broken arches and marble columns, continued to attest its ancient\r\n      splendor. 116 About six or seven miles from the city Diocletian\r\n      constructed a magnificent palace, and we may infer, from the\r\n      greatness of the work, how long he had meditated his design of\r\n      abdicating the empire. The choice of a spot which united all that\r\n      could contribute either to health or to luxury did not require\r\n      the partiality of a native. “The soil was dry and fertile, the\r\n      air is pure and wholesome, and, though extremely hot during the\r\n      summer months, this country seldom feels those sultry and noxious\r\n      winds to which the coasts of Istria and some parts of Italy are\r\n      exposed. The views from the palace are no less beautiful than the\r\n      soil and climate were inviting. Towards the west lies the fertile\r\n      shore that stretches along the Adriatic, in which a number of\r\n      small islands are scattered in such a manner as to give this part\r\n      of the sea the appearance of a great lake. On the north side lies\r\n      the bay, which led to the ancient city of Salona; and the country\r\n      beyond it, appearing in sight, forms a proper contrast to that\r\n      more extensive prospect of water, which the Adriatic presents\r\n      both to the south and to the east. Towards the north, the view is\r\n      terminated by high and irregular mountains, situated at a proper\r\n      distance, and in many places covered with villages, woods, and\r\n      vineyards.” 117\r\n\r\n      115 (return) [ See the Itiner. p. 269, 272, edit.

We may add a circumstance or two from the Abate\r\n      Fortis: the little stream of the Hyader, mentioned by Lucan,\r\n      produces most exquisite trout, which a sagacious writer, perhaps\r\n      a monk, supposes to have been one of the principal reasons that\r\n      determined Diocletian in the choice of his retirement. Fortis, p.\r\n      45. The same author (p. 38) observes, that a taste for\r\n      agriculture is reviving at Spalatro; and that an experimental\r\n      farm has lately been established near the city, by a society of\r\n      gentlemen.]\r\n\r\n      Though Constantine, from a very obvious prejudice, affects to\r\n      mention the palace of Diocletian with contempt, 118 yet one of\r\n      their successors, who could only see it in a neglected and\r\n      mutilated state, celebrates its magnificence in terms of the\r\n      highest admiration. 119 It covered an extent of ground consisting\r\n      of between nine and ten English acres. The form was quadrangular,\r\n      flanked with sixteen towers. Two of the sides were near six\r\n      hundred, and the other two near seven hundred feet in length. The\r\n      whole was constructed of a beautiful freestone, extracted from\r\n      the neighboring quarries of Trau, or Tragutium, and very little\r\n      inferior to marble itself. Four streets, intersecting each other\r\n      at right angles, divided the several parts of this great edifice,\r\n      and the approach to the principal apartment was from a very\r\n      stately entrance, which is still denominated the Golden Gate. The\r\n      approach was terminated by a _peristylium_ of granite columns, on\r\n      one side of which we discover the square temple of Æsculapius, on\r\n      the other the octagon temple of Jupiter. The latter of those\r\n      deities Diocletian revered as the patron of his fortunes, the\r\n      former as the protector of his health. By comparing the present\r\n      remains with the precepts of Vitruvius, the several parts of the\r\n      building, the baths, bedchamber, the _atrium_, the _basilica_,\r\n      and the Cyzicene, Corinthian, and Egyptian halls have been\r\n      described with some degree of precision, or at least of\r\n      probability. Their forms were various, their proportions just;\r\n      but they all were attended with two imperfections, very repugnant\r\n      to our modern notions of taste and conveniency. These stately\r\n      rooms had neither windows nor chimneys. They were lighted from\r\n      the top, (for the building seems to have consisted of no more\r\n      than one story,) and they received their heat by the help of\r\n      pipes that were conveyed along the walls. The range of principal\r\n      apartments was protected towards the south-west by a portico five\r\n      hundred and seventeen feet long, which must have formed a very\r\n      noble and delightful walk, when the beauties of painting and\r\n      sculpture were added to those of the prospect.\r\n\r\n      118 (return) [ Constantin.

Porphyr. de Statu Imper. p. 86.]\r\n\r\n      Had this magnificent edifice remained in a solitary country, it\r\n      would have been exposed to the ravages of time; but it might,\r\n      perhaps, have escaped the rapacious industry of man. The village\r\n      of Aspalathus, 120 and, long afterwards, the provincial town of\r\n      Spalatro, have grown out of its ruins. The Golden Gate now opens\r\n      into the market-place. St. John the Baptist has usurped the\r\n      honors of Æsculapius; and the temple of Jupiter, under the\r\n      protection of the Virgin, is converted into the cathedral church.\r\n\r\n      For this account of Diocletian’s palace we are principally\r\n      indebted to an ingenious artist of our own time and country, whom\r\n      a very liberal curiosity carried into the heart of Dalmatia. 121\r\n      But there is room to suspect that the elegance of his designs and\r\n      engraving has somewhat flattered the objects which it was their\r\n      purpose to represent. We are informed by a more recent and very\r\n      judicious traveller, that the awful ruins of Spalatro are not\r\n      less expressive of the decline of the art than of the greatness\r\n      of the Roman empire in the time of Diocletian. 122 If such was\r\n      indeed the state of architecture, we must naturally believe that\r\n      painting and sculpture had experienced a still more sensible\r\n      decay. The practice of architecture is directed by a few general\r\n      and even mechanical rules. But sculpture, and, above all,\r\n      painting, propose to themselves the imitation not only of the\r\n      forms of nature, but of the characters and passions of the human\r\n      soul. In those sublime arts the dexterity of the hand is of\r\n      little avail, unless it is animated by fancy, and guided by the\r\n      most correct taste and observation.\r\n\r\n      120 (return) [ D’Anville, Geographie Ancienne, tom. i. p. 162.]\r\n\r\n      121 (return) [ Messieurs Adam and Clerisseau, attended by two\r\n      draughtsmen visited Spalatro in the month of July, 1757.

The succession of\r\n      Illyrian princes restored the empire without restoring the\r\n      sciences. Their military education was not calculated to inspire\r\n      them with the love of letters; and even the mind of Diocletian,\r\n      however active and capacious in business, was totally uninformed\r\n      by study or speculation. The professions of law and physic are of\r\n      such common use and certain profit that they will always secure a\r\n      sufficient number of practitioners endowed with a reasonable\r\n      degree of abilities and knowledge; but it does not appear that\r\n      the students in those two faculties appeal to any celebrated\r\n      masters who have flourished within that period. The voice of\r\n      poetry was silent. History was reduced to dry and confused\r\n      abridgments, alike destitute of amusement and instruction. A\r\n      languid and affected eloquence was still retained in the pay and\r\n      service of the emperors, who encouraged not any arts except those\r\n      which contributed to the gratification of their pride, or the\r\n      defence of their power. 123\r\n\r\n      123 (return) [ The orator Eumenius was secretary to the emperors\r\n      Maximian and Constantius, and Professor of Rhetoric in the\r\n      college of Autun.

The school\r\n      of Alexandria silenced those of Athens; and the ancient sects\r\n      enrolled themselves under the banners of the more fashionable\r\n      teachers, who recommended their system by the novelty of their\r\n      method, and the austerity of their manners. Several of these\r\n      masters, Ammonius, Plotinus, Amelius, and Porphyry, 124 were men\r\n      of profound thought and intense application; but by mistaking the\r\n      true object of philosophy, their labors contributed much less to\r\n      improve than to corrupt the human understanding. The knowledge\r\n      that is suited to our situation and powers, the whole compass of\r\n      moral, natural, and mathematical science, was neglected by the\r\n      new Platonists; whilst they exhausted their strength in the\r\n      verbal disputes of metaphysics, attempted to explore the secrets\r\n      of the invisible world, and studied to reconcile Aristotle with\r\n      Plato, on subjects of which both these philosophers were as\r\n      ignorant as the rest of mankind. Consuming their reason in these\r\n      deep but unsubstantial meditations, their minds were exposed to\r\n      illusions of fancy. They flattered themselves that they possessed\r\n      the secret of disengaging the soul from its corporal prison;\r\n      claimed a familiar intercourse with demons and spirits; and, by a\r\n      very singular revolution, converted the study of philosophy into\r\n      that of magic. The ancient sages had derided the popular\r\n      superstition; after disguising its extravagance by the thin\r\n      pretence of allegory, the disciples of Plotinus and Porphyry\r\n      became its most zealous defenders. As they agreed with the\r\n      Christians in a few mysterious points of faith, they attacked the\r\n      remainder of their theological system with all the fury of civil\r\n      war. The new Platonists would scarcely deserve a place in the\r\n      history of science, but in that of the church the mention of them\r\n      will very frequently occur.\r\n\r\n      124 (return) [Porphyry died about the time of Diocletian’s\r\n      abdication.

It required such a fortunate mixture of different\r\n      tempers and abilities as could scarcely be found or even expected\r\n      a second time; two emperors without jealousy, two Cæsars without\r\n      ambition, and the same general interest invariably pursued by\r\n      four independent princes. The abdication of Diocletian and\r\n      Maximian was succeeded by eighteen years of discord and\r\n      confusion. The empire was afflicted by five civil wars; and the\r\n      remainder of the time was not so much a state of tranquillity as\r\n      a suspension of arms between several hostile monarchs, who,\r\n      viewing each other with an eye of fear and hatred, strove to\r\n      increase their respective forces at the expense of their\r\n      subjects.\r\n\r\n      As soon as Diocletian and Maximian had resigned the purple, their\r\n      station, according to the rules of the new constitution, was\r\n      filled by the two Cæsars, Constantius and Galerius, who\r\n      immediately assumed the title of Augustus. 1\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ M. de Montesquieu (Considerations sur la Grandeur et\r\n      La Decadence des Romains, c. 17) supposes, on the authority of\r\n      Orosius and Eusebius, that, on this occasion, the empire, for the\r\n      first time, was really divided into two parts. It is difficult,\r\n      however, to discover in what respect the plan of Galerius\r\n      differed from that of Diocletian.]\r\n\r\n      The honors of seniority and precedence were allowed to the former\r\n      of those princes, and he continued under a new appellation to\r\n      administer his ancient department of Gaul, Spain, and Britain.\r\n\r\n      The government of those ample provinces was sufficient to\r\n      exercise his talents and to satisfy his ambition. Clemency,\r\n      temperance, and moderation, distinguished the amiable character\r\n      of Constantius, and his fortunate subjects had frequently\r\n      occasion to compare the virtues of their sovereign with the\r\n      passions of Maximian, and even with the arts of Diocletian. 2\r\n      Instead of imitating their eastern pride and magnificence,\r\n      Constantius preserved the modesty of a Roman prince. He declared,\r\n      with unaffected sincerity, that his most valued treasure was in\r\n      the hearts of his people, and that, whenever the dignity of the\r\n      throne, or the danger of the state, required any extraordinary\r\n      supply, he could depend with confidence on their gratitude and\r\n      liberality. 3 The provincials of Gaul, Spain, and Britain,\r\n      sensible of his worth, and of their own happiness, reflected with\r\n      anxiety on the declining health of the emperor Constantius, and\r\n      the tender age of his numerous family, the issue of his second\r\n      marriage with the daughter of Maximian.\r\n\r\n      2 (return) [ Hic non modo amabilis, sed etiam venerabilis Gallis\r\n      fuit; præcipuc quod Diocletiani suspectam prudentiam, et\r\n      Maximiani sanguinariam violentiam imperio ejus evaserant.

His fame in arms, and,\r\n      above all, the success of the Persian war, had elated his haughty\r\n      mind, which was naturally impatient of a superior, or even of an\r\n      equal. If it were possible to rely on the partial testimony of an\r\n      injudicious writer, we might ascribe the abdication of Diocletian\r\n      to the menaces of Galerius, and relate the particulars of a\r\n      _private_ conversation between the two princes, in which the\r\n      former discovered as much pusillanimity as the latter displayed\r\n      ingratitude and arrogance. 4 But these obscure anecdotes are\r\n      sufficiently refuted by an impartial view of the character and\r\n      conduct of Diocletian. Whatever might otherwise have been his\r\n      intentions, if he had apprehended any danger from the violence of\r\n      Galerius, his good sense would have instructed him to prevent the\r\n      ignominious contest; and as he had held the sceptre with glory,\r\n      he would have resigned it without disgrace.\r\n\r\n      4 (return) [ Lactantius de Mort.

His reputation obtained him the esteem of Constantine,\r\n      who invited him to his court, and intrusted to him the education\r\n      of his son Crispus. The facts which he relates took place during\r\n      his own time; he cannot be accused of dishonesty or imposture.\r\n      Satis me vixisse arbitrabor et officium hominis implesse si labor\r\n      meus aliquos homines, ab erroribus iberatos, ad iter coeleste\r\n      direxerit.

The fame of Lactantius for\r\n      eloquence as well as for truth, would suffer no loss if it should\r\n      be adjudged to some more “obscure rhetorician.” Manso, in his\r\n      Leben Constantins des Grossen, concurs on this point with Gibbon\r\n      Beylage, iv. —M.]\r\n\r\n      After the elevation of Constantius and Galerius to the rank of\r\n      _Augusti_, two new _Cæsars_ were required to supply their place,\r\n      and to complete the system of the Imperial government. Diocletian\r\n      was sincerely desirous of withdrawing himself from the world; he\r\n      considered Galerius, who had married his daughter, as the firmest\r\n      support of his family and of the empire; and he consented,\r\n      without reluctance, that his successor should assume the merit as\r\n      well as the envy of the important nomination. It was fixed\r\n      without consulting the interest or inclination of the princes of\r\n      the West. Each of them had a son who was arrived at the age of\r\n      manhood, and who might have been deemed the most natural\r\n      candidates for the vacant honor. But the impotent resentment of\r\n      Maximian was no longer to be dreaded; and the moderate\r\n      Constantius, though he might despise the dangers, was humanely\r\n      apprehensive of the calamities, of civil war. The two persons\r\n      whom Galerius promoted to the rank of Cæsar were much better\r\n      suited to serve the views of his ambition; and their principal\r\n      recommendation seems to have consisted in the want of merit or\r\n      personal consequence. The first of these was Daza, or, as he was\r\n      afterwards called, Maximin, whose mother was the sister of\r\n      Galerius. The unexperienced youth still betrayed, by his manners\r\n      and language, his rustic education, when, to his own\r\n      astonishment, as well as that of the world, he was invested by\r\n      Diocletian with the purple, exalted to the dignity of Cæsar, and\r\n      intrusted with the sovereign command of Egypt and Syria. 5 At the\r\n      same time, Severus, a faithful servant, addicted to pleasure, but\r\n      not incapable of business, was sent to Milan, to receive, from\r\n      the reluctant hands of Maximian, the Cæsarian ornaments, and the\r\n      possession of Italy and Africa. According to the forms of the\r\n      constitution, Severus acknowledged the supremacy of the western\r\n      emperor; but he was absolutely devoted to the commands of his\r\n      benefactor Galerius, who, reserving to himself the intermediate\r\n      countries from the confines of Italy to those of Syria, firmly\r\n      established his power over three fourths of the monarchy. In the\r\n      full confidence that the approaching death of Constantius would\r\n      leave him sole master of the Roman world, we are assured that he\r\n      had arranged in his mind a long succession of future princes, and\r\n      that he meditated his own retreat from public life, after he\r\n      should have accomplished a glorious reign of about twenty years.\r\n      6 7\r\n\r\n      5 (return) [ Sublatus nuper a pecoribus et silvis (says\r\n      Lactantius de M.

P. c. 20.]\r\n\r\n      But within less than eighteen months, two unexpected revolutions\r\n      overturned the ambitious schemes of Galerius. The hopes of\r\n      uniting the western provinces to his empire were disappointed by\r\n      the elevation of Constantine, whilst Italy and Africa were lost\r\n      by the successful revolt of Maxentius.\r\n\r\n      I. The fame of Constantine has rendered posterity attentive to\r\n      the most minute circumstances of his life and actions. The place\r\n      of his birth, as well as the condition of his mother Helena, have\r\n      been the subject, not only of literary, but of national disputes.\r\n      Notwithstanding the recent tradition, which assigns for her\r\n      father a British king, 8 we are obliged to confess, that Helena\r\n      was the daughter of an innkeeper; but at the same time, we may\r\n      defend the legality of her marriage, against those who have\r\n      represented her as the concubine of Constantius. 9 The great\r\n      Constantine was most probably born at Naissus, in Dacia; 10 and\r\n      it is not surprising that, in a family and province distinguished\r\n      only by the profession of arms, the youth should discover very\r\n      little inclination to improve his mind by the acquisition of\r\n      knowledge. 11 He was about eighteen years of age when his father\r\n      was promoted to the rank of Cæsar; but that fortunate event was\r\n      attended with his mother’s divorce; and the splendor of an\r\n      Imperial alliance reduced the son of Helena to a state of\r\n      disgrace and humiliation. Instead of following Constantius in the\r\n      West, he remained in the service of Diocletian, signalized his\r\n      valor in the wars of Egypt and Persia, and gradually rose to the\r\n      honorable station of a tribune of the first order. The figure of\r\n      Constantine was tall and majestic; he was dexterous in all his\r\n      exercises, intrepid in war, affable in peace; in his whole\r\n      conduct, the active spirit of youth was tempered by habitual\r\n      prudence; and while his mind was engrossed by ambition, he\r\n      appeared cold and insensible to the allurements of pleasure. The\r\n      favor of the people and soldiers, who had named him as a worthy\r\n      candidate for the rank of Cæsar, served only to exasperate the\r\n      jealousy of Galerius; and though prudence might restrain him from\r\n      exercising any open violence, an absolute monarch is seldom at a\r\n      loss how to execute a sure and secret revenge. 12 Every hour\r\n      increased the danger of Constantine, and the anxiety of his\r\n      father, who, by repeated letters, expressed the warmest desire of\r\n      embracing his son. For some time the policy of Galerius supplied\r\n      him with delays and excuses; but it was impossible long to refuse\r\n      so natural a request of his associate, without maintaining his\r\n      refusal by arms. The permission of the journey was reluctantly\r\n      granted, and whatever precautions the emperor might have taken to\r\n      intercept a return, the consequences of which he, with so much\r\n      reason, apprehended, they were effectually disappointed by the\r\n      incredible diligence of Constantine. 13 Leaving the palace of\r\n      Nicomedia in the night, he travelled post through Bithynia,\r\n      Thrace, Dacia, Pannonia, Italy, and Gaul, and, amidst the joyful\r\n      acclamations of the people, reached the port of Boulogne in the\r\n      very moment when his father was preparing to embark for Britain.\r\n      14\r\n\r\n      8 (return) [ This tradition, unknown to the contemporaries of\r\n      Constantine was invented in the darkness of monestaries, was\r\n      embellished by Jeffrey of Monmouth, and the writers of the xiith\r\n      century, has been defended by our antiquarians of the last age,\r\n      and is seriously related in the ponderous History of England,\r\n      compiled by Mr. Carte, (vol. i. p. 147.)

By insisting on the divorce of Helena,\r\n      Diocletian acknowledged her marriage.]\r\n\r\n      10 (return) [ There are three opinions with regard to the place\r\n      of Constantine’s birth. 1. Our English antiquarians were used to\r\n      dwell with rapture on the words of his panegyrist, “Britannias\r\n      illic oriendo nobiles fecisti.” But this celebrated passage may\r\n      be referred with as much propriety to the accession, as to the\r\n      nativity of Constantine. 2. Some of the modern Greeks have\r\n      ascribed the honor of his birth to Drepanum, a town on the Gulf\r\n      of Nicomedia, (Cellarius, tom. ii. p. 174,) which Constantine\r\n      dignified with the name of Helenopolis, and Justinian adorned\r\n      with many splendid buildings, (Procop. de Edificiis, v. 2.) It is\r\n      indeed probable enough, that Helena’s father kept an inn at\r\n      Drepanum, and that Constantius might lodge there when he returned\r\n      from a Persian embassy, in the reign of Aurelian. But in the\r\n      wandering life of a soldier, the place of his marriage, and the\r\n      places where his children are born, have very little connection\r\n      with each other. 3. The claim of Naissus is supported by the\r\n      anonymous writer, published at the end of Ammianus, p. 710, and\r\n      who in general copied very good materials; and it is confirmed by\r\n      Julius Firmicus, (de Astrologia, l. i. c. 4,) who flourished\r\n      under the reign of Constantine himself.

P. c. 24. suppose, with less accuracy, that\r\n      he found his father on his death-bed.]\r\n\r\n      The British expedition, and an easy victory over the barbarians\r\n      of Caledonia, were the last exploits of the reign of Constantius.\r\n      He ended his life in the Imperial palace of York, fifteen months\r\n      after he had received the title of Augustus, and almost fourteen\r\n      years and a half after he had been promoted to the rank of Cæsar.\r\n      His death was immediately succeeded by the elevation of\r\n      Constantine. The ideas of inheritance and succession are so very\r\n      familiar, that the generality of mankind consider them as founded\r\n      not only in reason but in nature itself. Our imagination readily\r\n      transfers the same principles from private property to public\r\n      dominion: and whenever a virtuous father leaves behind him a son\r\n      whose merit seems to justify the esteem, or even the hopes, of\r\n      the people, the joint influence of prejudice and of affection\r\n      operates with irresistible weight. The flower of the western\r\n      armies had followed Constantius into Britain, and the national\r\n      troops were reënforced by a numerous body of Alemanni, who obeyed\r\n      the orders of Crocus, one of their hereditary chieftains. 15 The\r\n      opinion of their own importance, and the assurance that Britain,\r\n      Gaul, and Spain would acquiesce in their nomination, were\r\n      diligently inculcated to the legions by the adherents of\r\n      Constantine. The soldiers were asked, whether they could hesitate\r\n      a moment between the honor of placing at their head the worthy\r\n      son of their beloved emperor, and the ignominy of tamely\r\n      expecting the arrival of some obscure stranger, on whom it might\r\n      please the sovereign of Asia to bestow the armies and provinces\r\n      of the West. It was insinuated to them, that gratitude and\r\n      liberality held a distinguished place among the virtues of\r\n      Constantine; nor did that artful prince show himself to the\r\n      troops, till they were prepared to salute him with the names of\r\n      Augustus and Emperor. The throne was the object of his desires;\r\n      and had he been less actuated by ambition, it was his only means\r\n      of safety. He was well acquainted with the character and\r\n      sentiments of Galerius, and sufficiently apprised, that if he\r\n      wished to live he must determine to reign. The decent and even\r\n      obstinate resistance which he chose to affect, 16 was contrived\r\n      to justify his usurpation; nor did he yield to the acclamations\r\n      of the army, till he had provided the proper materials for a\r\n      letter, which he immediately despatched to the emperor of the\r\n      East. Constantine informed him of the melancholy event of his\r\n      father’s death, modestly asserted his natural claim to the\r\n      succession, and respectfully lamented, that the affectionate\r\n      violence of his troops had not permitted him to solicit the\r\n      Imperial purple in the regular and constitutional manner. The\r\n      first emotions of Galerius were those of surprise,\r\n      disappointment, and rage; and as he could seldom restrain his\r\n      passions, he loudly threatened, that he would commit to the\r\n      flames both the letter and the messenger. But his resentment\r\n      insensibly subsided; and when he recollected the doubtful chance\r\n      of war, when he had weighed the character and strength of his\r\n      adversary, he consented to embrace the honorable accommodation\r\n      which the prudence of Constantine had left open to him. Without\r\n      either condemning or ratifying the choice of the British army,\r\n      Galerius accepted the son of his deceased colleague as the\r\n      sovereign of the provinces beyond the Alps; but he gave him only\r\n      the title of Cæsar, and the fourth rank among the Roman princes,\r\n      whilst he conferred the vacant place of Augustus on his favorite\r\n      Severus. The apparent harmony of the empire was still preserved,\r\n      and Constantine, who already possessed the substance, expected,\r\n      without impatience, an opportunity of obtaining the honors, of\r\n      supreme power. 17\r\n\r\n      15 (return) [ Cunctis qui aderant, annitentibus, sed præcipue\r\n      Croco (alii Eroco) [Erich?] Alamannorum Rege, auxilii gratia\r\n      Constantium comitato, imperium capit.

But Constantine was in the thirty-second year of his\r\n      age, in the full vigor both of mind and body, at the time when\r\n      the eldest of his brothers could not possibly be more than\r\n      thirteen years old. His claim of superior merit had been allowed\r\n      and ratified by the dying emperor. 18 In his last moments\r\n      Constantius bequeathed to his eldest son the care of the safety\r\n      as well as greatness of the family; conjuring him to assume both\r\n      the authority and the sentiments of a father with regard to the\r\n      children of Theodora. Their liberal education, advantageous\r\n      marriages, the secure dignity of their lives, and the first\r\n      honors of the state with which they were invested, attest the\r\n      fraternal affection of Constantine; and as those princes\r\n      possessed a mild and grateful disposition, they submitted without\r\n      reluctance to the superiority of his genius and fortune. 19\r\n\r\n      18 (return) [ The choice of Constantine, by his dying father,\r\n      which is warranted by reason, and insinuated by Eumenius, seems\r\n      to be confirmed by the most unexceptionable authority, the\r\n      concurring evidence of Lactantius (de M.

The ambitious spirit of Galerius was scarcely reconciled to\r\n      the disappointment of his views upon the Gallic provinces, before\r\n      the unexpected loss of Italy wounded his pride as well as power\r\n      in a still more sensible part. The long absence of the emperors\r\n      had filled Rome with discontent and indignation; and the people\r\n      gradually discovered, that the preference given to Nicomedia and\r\n      Milan was not to be ascribed to the particular inclination of\r\n      Diocletian, but to the permanent form of government which he had\r\n      instituted. It was in vain that, a few months after his\r\n      abdication, his successors dedicated, under his name, those\r\n      magnificent baths, whose ruins still supply the ground as well as\r\n      the materials for so many churches and convents. 20 The\r\n      tranquility of those elegant recesses of ease and luxury was\r\n      disturbed by the impatient murmurs of the Romans, and a report\r\n      was insensibly circulated, that the sums expended in erecting\r\n      those buildings would soon be required at their hands. About that\r\n      time the avarice of Galerius, or perhaps the exigencies of the\r\n      state, had induced him to make a very strict and rigorous\r\n      inquisition into the property of his subjects, for the purpose of\r\n      a general taxation, both on their lands and on their persons. A\r\n      very minute survey appears to have been taken of their real\r\n      estates; and wherever there was the slightest suspicion of\r\n      concealment, torture was very freely employed to obtain a sincere\r\n      declaration of their personal wealth. 21 The privileges which had\r\n      exalted Italy above the rank of the provinces were no longer\r\n      regarded: 211 and the officers of the revenue already began to\r\n      number the Roman people, and to settle the proportion of the new\r\n      taxes. Even when the spirit of freedom had been utterly\r\n      extinguished, the tamest subjects have sometimes ventured to\r\n      resist an unprecedented invasion of their property; but on this\r\n      occasion the injury was aggravated by the insult, and the sense\r\n      of private interest was quickened by that of national honor. The\r\n      conquest of Macedonia, as we have already observed, had delivered\r\n      the Roman people from the weight of personal taxes.\r\n\r\n      Though they had experienced every form of despotism, they had now\r\n      enjoyed that exemption near five hundred years; nor could they\r\n      patiently brook the insolence of an Illyrian peasant, who, from\r\n      his distant residence in Asia, presumed to number Rome among the\r\n      tributary cities of his empire. The rising fury of the people was\r\n      encouraged by the authority, or at least the connivance, of the\r\n      senate; and the feeble remains of the Prætorian guards, who had\r\n      reason to apprehend their own dissolution, embraced so honorable\r\n      a pretence, and declared their readiness to draw their swords in\r\n      the service of their oppressed country. It was the wish, and it\r\n      soon became the hope, of every citizen, that after expelling from\r\n      Italy their foreign tyrants, they should elect a prince who, by\r\n      the place of his residence, and by his maxims of government,\r\n      might once more deserve the title of Roman emperor. The name, as\r\n      well as the situation, of Maxentius determined in his favor the\r\n      popular enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n      20 (return) [ See Gruter. Inscrip. p. 178.

It was a necessary consequence of\r\n      the division of the empire: it became impossible to maintain a\r\n      second court and executive, and leave so large and fruitful a\r\n      part of the territory exempt from contribution.—M.]\r\n\r\n      Maxentius was the son of the emperor Maximian, and he had married\r\n      the daughter of Galerius. His birth and alliance seemed to offer\r\n      him the fairest promise of succeeding to the empire; but his\r\n      vices and incapacity procured him the same exclusion from the\r\n      dignity of Cæsar, which Constantine had deserved by a dangerous\r\n      superiority of merit. The policy of Galerius preferred such\r\n      associates as would never disgrace the choice, nor dispute the\r\n      commands, of their benefactor. An obscure stranger was therefore\r\n      raised to the throne of Italy, and the son of the late emperor of\r\n      the West was left to enjoy the luxury of a private fortune in a\r\n      villa a few miles distant from the capital. The gloomy passions\r\n      of his soul, shame, vexation, and rage, were inflamed by envy on\r\n      the news of Constantine’s success; but the hopes of Maxentius\r\n      revived with the public discontent, and he was easily persuaded\r\n      to unite his personal injury and pretensions with the cause of\r\n      the Roman people. Two Prætorian tribunes and a commissary of\r\n      provisions undertook the management of the conspiracy; and as\r\n      every order of men was actuated by the same spirit, the immediate\r\n      event was neither doubtful nor difficult. The præfect of the\r\n      city, and a few magistrates, who maintained their fidelity to\r\n      Severus, were massacred by the guards; and Maxentius, invested\r\n      with the Imperial ornaments, was acknowledged by the applauding\r\n      senate and people as the protector of the Roman freedom and\r\n      dignity. It is uncertain whether Maximian was previously\r\n      acquainted with the conspiracy; but as soon as the standard of\r\n      rebellion was erected at Rome, the old emperor broke from the\r\n      retirement where the authority of Diocletian had condemned him to\r\n      pass a life of melancholy and solitude, and concealed his\r\n      returning ambition under the disguise of paternal tenderness. At\r\n      the request of his son and of the senate, he condescended to\r\n      reassume the purple. His ancient dignity, his experience, and his\r\n      fame in arms, added strength as well as reputation to the party\r\n      of Maxentius. 22\r\n\r\n      22 (return) [ The sixth Panegyric represents the conduct of\r\n      Maximian in the most favorable light, and the ambiguous\r\n      expression of Aurelius Victor, “retractante diu,” may signify\r\n      either that he contrived, or that he opposed, the conspiracy. See\r\n      Zosimus, l. ii. p. 79, and Lactantius de M. P. c. 26.]\r\n\r\n      According to the advice, or rather the orders, of his colleague,\r\n      the emperor Severus immediately hastened to Rome, in the full\r\n      confidence, that, by his unexpected celerity, he should easily\r\n      suppress the tumult of an unwarlike populace, commanded by a\r\n      licentious youth. But he found on his arrival the gates of the\r\n      city shut against him, the walls filled with men and arms, an\r\n      experienced general at the head of the rebels, and his own troops\r\n      without spirit or affection. A large body of Moors deserted to\r\n      the enemy, allured by the promise of a large donative; and, if it\r\n      be true that they had been levied by Maximian in his African war,\r\n      preferring the natural feelings of gratitude to the artificial\r\n      ties of allegiance. Anulinus, the Prætorian præfect, declared\r\n      himself in favor of Maxentius, and drew after him the most\r\n      considerable part of the troops, accustomed to obey his commands.\r\n\r\n      Rome, according to the expression of an orator, recalled her\r\n      armies; and the unfortunate Severus, destitute of force and of\r\n      counsel, retired, or rather fled, with precipitation, to Ravenna.\r\n\r\n      Here he might for some time have been safe. The fortifications of\r\n      Ravenna were able to resist the attempts, and the morasses that\r\n      surrounded the town were sufficient to prevent the approach, of\r\n      the Italian army. The sea, which Severus commanded with a\r\n      powerful fleet, secured him an inexhaustible supply of\r\n      provisions, and gave a free entrance to the legions, which, on\r\n      the return of spring, would advance to his assistance from\r\n      Illyricum and the East. Maximian, who conducted the siege in\r\n      person, was soon convinced that he might waste his time and his\r\n      army in the fruitless enterprise, and that he had nothing to hope\r\n      either from force or famine. With an art more suitable to the\r\n      character of Diocletian than to his own, he directed his attack,\r\n      not so much against the walls of Ravenna, as against the mind of\r\n      Severus. The treachery which he had experienced disposed that\r\n      unhappy prince to distrust the most sincere of his friends and\r\n      adherents. The emissaries of Maximian easily persuaded his\r\n      credulity, that a conspiracy was formed to betray the town, and\r\n      prevailed upon his fears not to expose himself to the discretion\r\n      of an irritated conqueror, but to accept the faith of an\r\n      honorable capitulation. He was at first received with humanity\r\n      and treated with respect. Maximian conducted the captive emperor\r\n      to Rome, and gave him the most solemn assurances that he had\r\n      secured his life by the resignation of the purple. But Severus\r\n      could obtain only an easy death and an Imperial funeral. When the\r\n      sentence was signified to him, the manner of executing it was\r\n      left to his own choice; he preferred the favorite mode of the\r\n      ancients, that of opening his veins; and as soon as he expired,\r\n      his body was carried to the sepulchre which had been constructed\r\n      for the family of Gallienus. 23\r\n\r\n      23 (return) [ The circumstances of this war, and the death of\r\n      Severus, are very doubtfully and variously told in our ancient\r\n      fragments, (see Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iv. part i.\r\n      p. 555.) I have endeavored to extract from them a consistent and\r\n      probable narration. * Note: Manso justly observes that two\r\n      totally different narratives might be formed, almost upon equal\r\n      authority.

Notwithstanding the\r\n      superiority of his age and dignity, the indefatigable Maximian\r\n      passed the Alps, and, courting a personal interview with the\r\n      sovereign of Gaul, carried with him his daughter Fausta as the\r\n      pledge of the new alliance. The marriage was celebrated at Arles\r\n      with every circumstance of magnificence; and the ancient\r\n      colleague of Diocletian, who again asserted his claim to the\r\n      Western empire, conferred on his son-in-law and ally the title of\r\n      Augustus. By consenting to receive that honor from Maximian,\r\n      Constantine seemed to embrace the cause of Rome and of the\r\n      senate; but his professions were ambiguous, and his assistance\r\n      slow and ineffectual. He considered with attention the\r\n      approaching contest between the masters of Italy and the emperor\r\n      of the East, and was prepared to consult his own safety or\r\n      ambition in the event of the war. 24\r\n\r\n      24 (return) [ The sixth Panegyric was pronounced to celebrate the\r\n      elevation of Constantine; but the prudent orator avoids the\r\n      mention either of Galerius or of Maxentius. He introduces only\r\n      one slight allusion to the actual troubles, and to the majesty of\r\n      Rome. * Note: Compare Manso, Beylage, iv. p. 302. Gibbon’s\r\n      account is at least as probable as that of his critic.—M.]\r\n\r\n      The importance of the occasion called for the presence and\r\n      abilities of Galerius. At the head of a powerful army, collected\r\n      from Illyricum and the East, he entered Italy, resolved to\r\n      revenge the death of Severus, and to chastise the rebellious\r\n      Romans; or, as he expressed his intentions, in the furious\r\n      language of a barbarian, to extirpate the senate, and to destroy\r\n      the people by the sword. But the skill of Maximian had concerted\r\n      a prudent system of defence. The invader found every place\r\n      hostile, fortified, and inaccessible; and though he forced his\r\n      way as far as Narni, within sixty miles of Rome, his dominion in\r\n      Italy was confined to the narrow limits of his camp. Sensible of\r\n      the increasing difficulties of his enterprise, the haughty\r\n      Galerius made the first advances towards a reconciliation, and\r\n      despatched two of his most considerable officers to tempt the\r\n      Roman princes by the offer of a conference, and the declaration\r\n      of his paternal regard for Maxentius, who might obtain much more\r\n      from his liberality than he could hope from the doubtful chance\r\n      of war. 25 The offers of Galerius were rejected with firmness,\r\n      his perfidious friendship refused with contempt, and it was not\r\n      long before he discovered, that, unless he provided for his\r\n      safety by a timely retreat, he had some reason to apprehend the\r\n      fate of Severus. The wealth which the Romans defended against his\r\n      rapacious tyranny, they freely contributed for his destruction.\r\n      The name of Maximian, the popular arts of his son, the secret\r\n      distribution of large sums, and the promise of still more liberal\r\n      rewards, checked the ardor and corrupted the fidelity of the\r\n      Illyrian legions; and when Galerius at length gave the signal of\r\n      the retreat, it was with some difficulty that he could prevail on\r\n      his veterans not to desert a banner which had so often conducted\r\n      them to victory and honor. A contemporary writer assigns two\r\n      other causes for the failure of the expedition; but they are both\r\n      of such a nature, that a cautious historian will scarcely venture\r\n      to adopt them. We are told that Galerius, who had formed a very\r\n      imperfect notion of the greatness of Rome by the cities of the\r\n      East with which he was acquainted, found his forces inadequate to\r\n      the siege of that immense capital.\r\n\r\n      But the extent of a city serves only to render it more accessible\r\n      to the enemy: Rome had long since been accustomed to submit on\r\n      the approach of a conqueror; nor could the temporary enthusiasm\r\n      of the people have long contended against the discipline and\r\n      valor of the legions. We are likewise informed that the legions\r\n      themselves were struck with horror and remorse, and that those\r\n      pious sons of the republic refused to violate the sanctity of\r\n      their venerable parent. 26 But when we recollect with how much\r\n      ease, in the more ancient civil wars, the zeal of party and the\r\n      habits of military obedience had converted the native citizens of\r\n      Rome into her most implacable enemies, we shall be inclined to\r\n      distrust this extreme delicacy of strangers and barbarians, who\r\n      had never beheld Italy till they entered it in a hostile manner.\r\n      Had they not been restrained by motives of a more interested\r\n      nature, they would probably have answered Galerius in the words\r\n      of Cæsar’s veterans: “If our general wishes to lead us to the\r\n      banks of the Tyber, we are prepared to trace out his camp.\r\n      Whatsoever walls he has determined to level with the ground, our\r\n      hands are ready to work the engines: nor shall we hesitate,\r\n      should the name of the devoted city be Rome itself.” These are\r\n      indeed the expressions of a poet; but of a poet who has been\r\n      distinguished, and even censured, for his strict adherence to the\r\n      truth of history. 27\r\n\r\n      25 (return) [ With regard to this negotiation, see the fragments\r\n      of an anonymous historian, published by Valesius at the end of\r\n      his edition of Ammianus Marcellinus, p. 711.

Pharsal. i. 381.]\r\n\r\n      The legions of Galerius exhibited a very melancholy proof of\r\n      their disposition, by the ravages which they committed in their\r\n      retreat. They murdered, they ravished, they plundered, they drove\r\n      away the flocks and herds of the Italians; they burnt the\r\n      villages through which they passed, and they endeavored to\r\n      destroy the country which it had not been in their power to\r\n      subdue. During the whole march, Maxentius hung on their rear, but\r\n      he very prudently declined a general engagement with those brave\r\n      and desperate veterans. His father had undertaken a second\r\n      journey into Gaul, with the hope of persuading Constantine, who\r\n      had assembled an army on the frontier, to join in the pursuit,\r\n      and to complete the victory. But the actions of Constantine were\r\n      guided by reason, and not by resentment. He persisted in the wise\r\n      resolution of maintaining a balance of power in the divided\r\n      empire, and he no longer hated Galerius, when that aspiring\r\n      prince had ceased to be an object of terror. 28\r\n\r\n      28 (return) [ Lactantius de M. P. c. 27. Zosim. l. ii. p. 82. The\r\n      latter, that Constantine, in his interview with Maximian, had\r\n      promised to declare war against Galerius.]\r\n\r\n      The mind of Galerius was the most susceptible of the sterner\r\n      passions, but it was not, however, incapable of a sincere and\r\n      lasting friendship. Licinius, whose manners as well as character\r\n      were not unlike his own, seems to have engaged both his affection\r\n      and esteem. Their intimacy had commenced in the happier period\r\n      perhaps of their youth and obscurity. It had been cemented by the\r\n      freedom and dangers of a military life; they had advanced almost\r\n      by equal steps through the successive honors of the service; and\r\n      as soon as Galerius was invested with the Imperial dignity, he\r\n      seems to have conceived the design of raising his companion to\r\n      the same rank with himself. During the short period of his\r\n      prosperity, he considered the rank of Cæsar as unworthy of the\r\n      age and merit of Licinius, and rather chose to reserve for him\r\n      the place of Constantius, and the empire of the West. While the\r\n      emperor was employed in the Italian war, he intrusted his friend\r\n      with the defence of the Danube; and immediately after his return\r\n      from that unfortunate expedition, he invested Licinius with the\r\n      vacant purple of Severus, resigning to his immediate command the\r\n      provinces of Illyricum. 29 The news of his promotion was no\r\n      sooner carried into the East, than Maximin, who governed, or\r\n      rather oppressed, the countries of Egypt and Syria, betrayed his\r\n      envy and discontent, disdained the inferior name of Cæsar, and,\r\n      notwithstanding the prayers as well as arguments of Galerius,\r\n      exacted, almost by violence, the equal title of Augustus. 30 For\r\n      the first, and indeed for the last time, the Roman world was\r\n      administered by six emperors. In the West, Constantine and\r\n      Maxentius affected to reverence their father Maximian. In the\r\n      East, Licinius and Maximin honored with more real consideration\r\n      their benefactor Galerius. The opposition of interest, and the\r\n      memory of a recent war, divided the empire into two great hostile\r\n      powers; but their mutual fears produced an apparent tranquillity,\r\n      and even a feigned reconciliation, till the death of the elder\r\n      princes, of Maximian, and more particularly of Galerius, gave a\r\n      new direction to the views and passions of their surviving\r\n      associates.\r\n\r\n      29 (return) [ M. de Tillemont (Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iv. part\r\n      i. p. 559) has proved that Licinius, without passing through the\r\n      intermediate rank of Cæsar, was declared Augustus, the 11th of\r\n      November, A. D. 307, after the return of Galerius from Italy.]\r\n\r\n      30 (return) [ Lactantius de M. P. c. 32. When Galerius declared\r\n      Licinius Augustus with himself, he tried to satisfy his younger\r\n      associates, by inventing for Constantine and Maximin (not\r\n      Maxentius; see Baluze, p. 81) the new title of sons of the\r\n      Augusti. But when Maximin acquainted him that he had been saluted\r\n      Augustus by the army, Galerius was obliged to acknowledge him as\r\n      well as Constantine, as equal associates in the Imperial\r\n      dignity.]\r\n\r\n      When Maximian had reluctantly abdicated the empire, the venal\r\n      orators of the times applauded his philosophic moderation. When\r\n      his ambition excited, or at least encouraged, a civil war, they\r\n      returned thanks to his generous patriotism, and gently censured\r\n      that love of ease and retirement which had withdrawn him from the\r\n      public service. 31 But it was impossible that minds like those of\r\n      Maximian and his son could long possess in harmony an undivided\r\n      power. Maxentius considered himself as the legal sovereign of\r\n      Italy, elected by the Roman senate and people; nor would he\r\n      endure the control of his father, who arrogantly declared that by\r\n      _his_ name and abilities the rash youth had been established on\r\n      the throne. The cause was solemnly pleaded before the Prætorian\r\n      guards; and those troops, who dreaded the severity of the old\r\n      emperor, espoused the party of Maxentius. 32 The life and freedom\r\n      of Maximian were, however, respected, and he retired from Italy\r\n      into Illyricum, affecting to lament his past conduct, and\r\n      secretly contriving new mischiefs. But Galerius, who was well\r\n      acquainted with his character, soon obliged him to leave his\r\n      dominions, and the last refuge of the disappointed Maximian was\r\n      the court of his son-in-law Constantine. 33 He was received with\r\n      respect by that artful prince, and with the appearance of filial\r\n      tenderness by the empress Fausta. That he might remove every\r\n      suspicion, he resigned the Imperial purple a second time, 34\r\n      professing himself at length convinced of the vanity of greatness\r\n      and ambition. Had he persevered in this resolution, he might have\r\n      ended his life with less dignity, indeed, than in his first\r\n      retirement, yet, however, with comfort and reputation. But the\r\n      near prospect of a throne brought back to his remembrance the\r\n      state from whence he was fallen, and he resolved, by a desperate\r\n      effort, either to reign or to perish. An incursion of the Franks\r\n      had summoned Constantine, with a part of his army, to the banks\r\n      of the Rhine; the remainder of the troops were stationed in the\r\n      southern provinces of Gaul, which lay exposed to the enterprises\r\n      of the Italian emperor, and a considerable treasure was deposited\r\n      in the city of Arles. Maximian either craftily invented, or\r\n      easily credited, a vain report of the death of Constantine.\r\n      Without hesitation he ascended the throne, seized the treasure,\r\n      and scattering it with his accustomed profusion among the\r\n      soldiers, endeavored to awake in their minds the memory of his\r\n      ancient dignity and exploits. Before he could establish his\r\n      authority, or finish the negotiation which he appears to have\r\n      entered into with his son Maxentius, the celerity of Constantine\r\n      defeated all his hopes. On the first news of his perfidy and\r\n      ingratitude, that prince returned by rapid marches from the Rhine\r\n      to the Saone, embarked on the last-mentioned river at Chalons,\r\n      and, at Lyons trusting himself to the rapidity of the Rhone,\r\n      arrived at the gates of Arles with a military force which it was\r\n      impossible for Maximian to resist, and which scarcely permitted\r\n      him to take refuge in the neighboring city of Marseilles. The\r\n      narrow neck of land which joined that place to the continent was\r\n      fortified against the besiegers, whilst the sea was open, either\r\n      for the escape of Maximian, or for the succor of Maxentius, if\r\n      the latter should choose to disguise his invasion of Gaul under\r\n      the honorable pretence of defending a distressed, or, as he might\r\n      allege, an injured father. Apprehensive of the fatal consequences\r\n      of delay, Constantine gave orders for an immediate assault; but\r\n      the scaling-ladders were found too short for the height of the\r\n      walls, and Marseilles might have sustained as long a siege as it\r\n      formerly did against the arms of Cæsar, if the garrison,\r\n      conscious either of their fault or of their danger, had not\r\n      purchased their pardon by delivering up the city and the person\r\n      of Maximian. A secret but irrevocable sentence of death was\r\n      pronounced against the usurper; he obtained only the same favor\r\n      which he had indulged to Severus, and it was published to the\r\n      world, that, oppressed by the remorse of his repeated crimes, he\r\n      strangled himself with his own hands. After he had lost the\r\n      assistance, and disdained the moderate counsels, of Diocletian,\r\n      the second period of his active life was a series of public\r\n      calamities and personal mortifications, which were terminated, in\r\n      about three years, by an ignominious death. He deserved his fate;\r\n      but we should find more reason to applaud the humanity of\r\n      Constantine, if he had spared an old man, the benefactor of his\r\n      father, and the father of his wife. During the whole of this\r\n      melancholy transaction, it appears that Fausta sacrificed the\r\n      sentiments of nature to her conjugal duties. 35\r\n\r\n      31 (return) [ See Panegyr.

He survived his retreat from Italy about four years;\r\n      and wisely relinquishing his views of universal empire, he\r\n      devoted the remainder of his life to the enjoyment of pleasure,\r\n      and to the execution of some works of public utility, among which\r\n      we may distinguish the discharging into the Danube the\r\n      superfluous waters of the Lake Pelso, and the cutting down the\r\n      immense forests that encompassed it; an operation worthy of a\r\n      monarch, since it gave an extensive country to the agriculture of\r\n      his Pannonian subjects. 36 His death was occasioned by a very\r\n      painful and lingering disorder. His body, swelled by an\r\n      intemperate course of life to an unwieldy corpulence, was covered\r\n      with ulcers, and devoured by innumerable swarms of those insects\r\n      which have given their name to a most loathsome disease; 37 but\r\n      as Galerius had offended a very zealous and powerful party among\r\n      his subjects, his sufferings, instead of exciting their\r\n      compassion, have been celebrated as the visible effects of divine\r\n      justice. 38 He had no sooner expired in his palace of Nicomedia,\r\n      than the two emperors who were indebted for their purple to his\r\n      favors, began to collect their forces, with the intention either\r\n      of disputing, or of dividing, the dominions which he had left\r\n      without a master. They were persuaded, however, to desist from\r\n      the former design, and to agree in the latter. The provinces of\r\n      Asia fell to the share of Maximin, and those of Europe augmented\r\n      the portion of Licinius. The Hellespont and the Thracian\r\n      Bosphorus formed their mutual boundary, and the banks of those\r\n      narrow seas, which flowed in the midst of the Roman world, were\r\n      covered with soldiers, with arms, and with fortifications. The\r\n      deaths of Maximian and of Galerius reduced the number of emperors\r\n      to four. The sense of their true interest soon connected Licinius\r\n      and Constantine; a secret alliance was concluded between Maximin\r\n      and Maxentius, and their unhappy subjects expected with terror\r\n      the bloody consequences of their inevitable dissensions, which\r\n      were no longer restrained by the fear or the respect which they\r\n      had entertained for Galerius. 39\r\n\r\n      36 (return) [ Aurelius Victor, c. 40.

In the sixth\r\n      year of his reign, Constantine visited the city of Autun, and\r\n      generously remitted the arrears of tribute, reducing at the same\r\n      time the proportion of their assessment from twenty-five to\r\n      eighteen thousand heads, subject to the real and personal\r\n      capitation. 40 Yet even this indulgence affords the most\r\n      unquestionable proof of the public misery. This tax was so\r\n      extremely oppressive, either in itself or in the mode of\r\n      collecting it, that whilst the revenue was increased by\r\n      extortion, it was diminished by despair: a considerable part of\r\n      the territory of Autun was left uncultivated; and great numbers\r\n      of the provincials rather chose to live as exiles and outlaws,\r\n      than to support the weight of civil society. It is but too\r\n      probable, that the bountiful emperor relieved, by a partial act\r\n      of liberality, one among the many evils which he had caused by\r\n      his general maxims of administration. But even those maxims were\r\n      less the effect of choice than of necessity. And if we except the\r\n      death of Maximian, the reign of Constantine in Gaul seems to have\r\n      been the most innocent and even virtuous period of his life.\r\n\r\n      The provinces were protected by his presence from the inroads of\r\n      the barbarians, who either dreaded or experienced his active\r\n      valor. After a signal victory over the Franks and Alemanni,\r\n      several of their princes were exposed by his order to the wild\r\n      beasts in the amphitheatre of Treves, and the people seem to have\r\n      enjoyed the spectacle, without discovering, in such a treatment\r\n      of royal captives, any thing that was repugnant to the laws of\r\n      nations or of humanity. 41\r\n\r\n      40 (return) [ See the viiith Panegyr., in which Eumenius\r\n      displays, in the presence of Constantine, the misery and the\r\n      gratitude of the city of Autun.]\r\n\r\n      41 (return) [Eutropius, x. 3.

The orator appeals to the\r\n      ancient ideal of the republic.—M.]\r\n\r\n      The virtues of Constantine were rendered more illustrious by the\r\n      vices of Maxentius. Whilst the Gallic provinces enjoyed as much\r\n      happiness as the condition of the times was capable of receiving,\r\n      Italy and Africa groaned under the dominion of a tyrant, as\r\n      contemptible as he was odious. The zeal of flattery and faction\r\n      has indeed too frequently sacrificed the reputation of the\r\n      vanquished to the glory of their successful rivals; but even\r\n      those writers who have revealed, with the most freedom and\r\n      pleasure, the faults of Constantine, unanimously confess that\r\n      Maxentius was cruel, rapacious, and profligate. 42 He had the\r\n      good fortune to suppress a slight rebellion in Africa. The\r\n      governor and a few adherents had been guilty; the province\r\n      suffered for their crime. The flourishing cities of Cirtha and\r\n      Carthage, and the whole extent of that fertile country, were\r\n      wasted by fire and sword. The abuse of victory was followed by\r\n      the abuse of law and justice. A formidable army of sycophants and\r\n      delators invaded Africa; the rich and the noble were easily\r\n      convicted of a connection with the rebels; and those among them\r\n      who experienced the emperor’s clemency, were only punished by the\r\n      confiscation of their estates. 43 So signal a victory was\r\n      celebrated by a magnificent triumph, and Maxentius exposed to the\r\n      eyes of the people the spoils and captives of a Roman province.\r\n      The state of the capital was no less deserving of compassion than\r\n      that of Africa. The wealth of Rome supplied an inexhaustible fund\r\n      for his vain and prodigal expenses, and the ministers of his\r\n      revenue were skilled in the arts of rapine. It was under his\r\n      reign that the method of exacting a _free gift_ from the senators\r\n      was first invented; and as the sum was insensibly increased, the\r\n      pretences of levying it, a victory, a birth, a marriage, or an\r\n      imperial consulship, were proportionably multiplied. 44 Maxentius\r\n      had imbibed the same implacable aversion to the senate, which had\r\n      characterized most of the former tyrants of Rome; nor was it\r\n      possible for his ungrateful temper to forgive the generous\r\n      fidelity which had raised him to the throne, and supported him\r\n      against all his enemies. The lives of the senators were exposed\r\n      to his jealous suspicions, the dishonor of their wives and\r\n      daughters heightened the gratification of his sensual passions.\r\n      45 It may be presumed that an Imperial lover was seldom reduced\r\n      to sigh in vain; but whenever persuasion proved ineffectual, he\r\n      had recourse to violence; and there remains _one_ memorable\r\n      example of a noble matron, who preserved her chastity by a\r\n      voluntary death. The soldiers were the only order of men whom he\r\n      appeared to respect, or studied to please. He filled Rome and\r\n      Italy with armed troops, connived at their tumults, suffered them\r\n      with impunity to plunder, and even to massacre, the defenceless\r\n      people; 46 and indulging them in the same licentiousness which\r\n      their emperor enjoyed, Maxentius often bestowed on his military\r\n      favorites the splendid villa, or the beautiful wife, of a\r\n      senator. A prince of such a character, alike incapable of\r\n      governing, either in peace or in war, might purchase the support,\r\n      but he could never obtain the esteem, of the army. Yet his pride\r\n      was equal to his other vices. Whilst he passed his indolent life\r\n      either within the walls of his palace, or in the neighboring\r\n      gardens of Sallust, he was repeatedly heard to declare, that _he\r\n      alone_ was emperor, and that the other princes were no more than\r\n      his lieutenants, on whom he had devolved the defence of the\r\n      frontier provinces, that he might enjoy without interruption the\r\n      elegant luxury of the capital. Rome, which had so long regretted\r\n      the absence, lamented, during the six years of his reign, the\r\n      presence of her sovereign. 47\r\n\r\n      42 (return) [ Julian excludes Maxentius from the banquet of the\r\n      Cæsars with abhorrence and contempt; and Zosimus (l. ii. p. 85)\r\n      accuses him of every kind of cruelty and profligacy.]\r\n\r\n      43 (return) [ Zosimus, l. ii. p. 83—85.

But the tyrant of Italy\r\n      rashly ventured to provoke a formidable enemy, whose ambition had\r\n      been hitherto restrained by considerations of prudence, rather\r\n      than by principles of justice. 48 After the death of Maximian,\r\n      his titles, according to the established custom, had been erased,\r\n      and his statues thrown down with ignominy. His son, who had\r\n      persecuted and deserted him when alive, effected to display the\r\n      most pious regard for his memory, and gave orders that a similar\r\n      treatment should be immediately inflicted on all the statues that\r\n      had been erected in Italy and Africa to the honor of Constantine.\r\n\r\n      That wise prince, who sincerely wished to decline a war, with the\r\n      difficulty and importance of which he was sufficiently\r\n      acquainted, at first dissembled the insult, and sought for\r\n      redress by the milder expedient of negotiation, till he was\r\n      convinced that the hostile and ambitious designs of the Italian\r\n      emperor made it necessary for him to arm in his own defence.\r\n      Maxentius, who openly avowed his pretensions to the whole\r\n      monarchy of the West, had already prepared a very considerable\r\n      force to invade the Gallic provinces on the side of Rhætia; and\r\n      though he could not expect any assistance from Licinius, he was\r\n      flattered with the hope that the legions of Illyricum, allured by\r\n      his presents and promises, would desert the standard of that\r\n      prince, and unanimously declare themselves his soldiers and\r\n      subjects. 49 Constantine no longer hesitated. He had deliberated\r\n      with caution, he acted with vigor. He gave a private audience to\r\n      the ambassadors, who, in the name of the senate and people,\r\n      conjured him to deliver Rome from a detested tyrant; and without\r\n      regarding the timid remonstrances of his council, he resolved to\r\n      prevent the enemy, and to carry the war into the heart of Italy.\r\n      50\r\n\r\n      48 (return) [ After the victory of Constantine, it was\r\n      universally allowed, that the motive of delivering the republic\r\n      from a detested tyrant, would, at any time, have justified his\r\n      expedition into Italy.

Photius (p. 63) has made a short\r\n      extract from that historical work.]\r\n\r\n      The enterprise was as full of danger as of glory; and the\r\n      unsuccessful event of two former invasions was sufficient to\r\n      inspire the most serious apprehensions. The veteran troops, who\r\n      revered the name of Maximian, had embraced in both those wars the\r\n      party of his son, and were now restrained by a sense of honor, as\r\n      well as of interest, from entertaining an idea of a second\r\n      desertion. Maxentius, who considered the Prætorian guards as the\r\n      firmest defence of his throne, had increased them to their\r\n      ancient establishment; and they composed, including the rest of\r\n      the Italians who were enlisted into his service, a formidable\r\n      body of fourscore thousand men. Forty thousand Moors and\r\n      Carthaginians had been raised since the reduction of Africa. Even\r\n      Sicily furnished its proportion of troops; and the armies of\r\n      Maxentius amounted to one hundred and seventy thousand foot and\r\n      eighteen thousand horse. The wealth of Italy supplied the\r\n      expenses of the war; and the adjacent provinces were exhausted,\r\n      to form immense magazines of corn and every other kind of\r\n      provisions.\r\n\r\n      The whole force of Constantine consisted of ninety thousand foot\r\n      and eight thousand horse; 51 and as the defence of the Rhine\r\n      required an extraordinary attention during the absence of the\r\n      emperor, it was not in his power to employ above half his troops\r\n      in the Italian expedition, unless he sacrificed the public safety\r\n      to his private quarrel. 52 At the head of about forty thousand\r\n      soldiers he marched to encounter an enemy whose numbers were at\r\n      least four times superior to his own. But the armies of Rome,\r\n      placed at a secure distance from danger, were enervated by\r\n      indulgence and luxury. Habituated to the baths and theatres of\r\n      Rome, they took the field with reluctance, and were chiefly\r\n      composed of veterans who had almost forgotten, or of new levies\r\n      who had never acquired, the use of arms and the practice of war.\r\n      The hardy legions of Gaul had long defended the frontiers of the\r\n      empire against the barbarians of the North; and in the\r\n      performance of that laborious service, their valor was exercised\r\n      and their discipline confirmed. There appeared the same\r\n      difference between the leaders as between the armies. Caprice or\r\n      flattery had tempted Maxentius with the hopes of conquest; but\r\n      these aspiring hopes soon gave way to the habits of pleasure and\r\n      the consciousness of his inexperience. The intrepid mind of\r\n      Constantine had been trained from his earliest youth to war, to\r\n      action, and to military command.\r\n\r\n      51 (return) [ Zosimus (l. ii. p. 86) has given us this curious\r\n      account of the forces on both sides.

Vet. ix. 25)\r\n      that the war was carried on by sea as well as by land; and that\r\n      the fleet of Constantine took possession of Sardinia, Corsica,\r\n      and the ports of Italy.]\r\n\r\n      52 (return) [ Panegyr.

Citadels, constructed with no less skill than\r\n      labor and expense, command every avenue into the plain, and on\r\n      that side render Italy almost inaccessible to the enemies of the\r\n      king of Sardinia. 54 But in the course of the intermediate\r\n      period, the generals, who have attempted the passage, have seldom\r\n      experienced any difficulty or resistance. In the age of\r\n      Constantine, the peasants of the mountains were civilized and\r\n      obedient subjects; the country was plentifully stocked with\r\n      provisions, and the stupendous highways, which the Romans had\r\n      carried over the Alps, opened several communications between Gaul\r\n      and Italy. 55 Constantine preferred the road of the Cottian Alps,\r\n      or, as it is now called, of Mount Cenis, and led his troops with\r\n      such active diligence, that he descended into the plain of\r\n      Piedmont before the court of Maxentius had received any certain\r\n      intelligence of his departure from the banks of the Rhine. The\r\n      city of Susa, however, which is situated at the foot of Mount\r\n      Cenis, was surrounded with walls, and provided with a garrison\r\n      sufficiently numerous to check the progress of an invader; but\r\n      the impatience of Constantine’s troops disdained the tedious\r\n      forms of a siege. The same day that they appeared before Susa,\r\n      they applied fire to the gates, and ladders to the walls; and\r\n      mounting to the assault amidst a shower of stones and arrows,\r\n      they entered the place sword in hand, and cut in pieces the\r\n      greatest part of the garrison. The flames were extinguished by\r\n      the care of Constantine, and the remains of Susa preserved from\r\n      total destruction. About forty miles from thence, a more severe\r\n      contest awaited him. A numerous army of Italians was assembled\r\n      under the lieutenants of Maxentius, in the plains of Turin. Its\r\n      principal strength consisted in a species of heavy cavalry, which\r\n      the Romans, since the decline of their discipline, had borrowed\r\n      from the nations of the East. The horses, as well as the men,\r\n      were clothed in complete armor, the joints of which were artfully\r\n      adapted to the motions of their bodies. The aspect of this\r\n      cavalry was formidable, their weight almost irresistible; and as,\r\n      on this occasion, their generals had drawn them up in a compact\r\n      column or wedge, with a sharp point, and with spreading flanks,\r\n      they flattered themselves that they could easily break and\r\n      trample down the army of Constantine. They might, perhaps, have\r\n      succeeded in their design, had not their experienced adversary\r\n      embraced the same method of defence, which in similar\r\n      circumstances had been practised by Aurelian. The skilful\r\n      evolutions of Constantine divided and baffled this massy column\r\n      of cavalry. The troops of Maxentius fled in confusion towards\r\n      Turin; and as the gates of the city were shut against them, very\r\n      few escaped the sword of the victorious pursuers. By this\r\n      important service, Turin deserved to experience the clemency and\r\n      even favor of the conqueror. He made his entry into the Imperial\r\n      palace of Milan, and almost all the cities of Italy between the\r\n      Alps and the Po not only acknowledged the power, but embraced\r\n      with zeal the party, of Constantine. 56\r\n\r\n      53 (return) [ The three principal passages of the Alps between\r\n      Gaul and Italy, are those of Mount St. Bernard, Mount Cenis, and\r\n      Mount Genevre.

We must apply to\r\n      the two Panegyrics for the intermediate actions of Constantine.]\r\n\r\n      From Milan to Rome, the Æmilian and Flaminian highways offered an\r\n      easy march of about four hundred miles; but though Constantine\r\n      was impatient to encounter the tyrant, he prudently directed his\r\n      operations against another army of Italians, who, by their\r\n      strength and position, might either oppose his progress, or, in\r\n      case of a misfortune, might intercept his retreat. Ruricius\r\n      Pompeianus, a general distinguished by his valor and ability, had\r\n      under his command the city of Verona, and all the troops that\r\n      were stationed in the province of Venetia. As soon as he was\r\n      informed that Constantine was advancing towards him, he detached\r\n      a large body of cavalry, which was defeated in an engagement near\r\n      Brescia, and pursued by the Gallic legions as far as the gates of\r\n      Verona. The necessity, the importance, and the difficulties of\r\n      the siege of Verona, immediately presented themselves to the\r\n      sagacious mind of Constantine. 57 The city was accessible only by\r\n      a narrow peninsula towards the west, as the other three sides\r\n      were surrounded by the Adige, a rapid river, which covered the\r\n      province of Venetia, from whence the besieged derived an\r\n      inexhaustible supply of men and provisions. It was not without\r\n      great difficulty, and after several fruitless attempts, that\r\n      Constantine found means to pass the river at some distance above\r\n      the city, and in a place where the torrent was less violent. He\r\n      then encompassed Verona with strong lines, pushed his attacks\r\n      with prudent vigor, and repelled a desperate sally of Pompeianus.\r\n      That intrepid general, when he had used every means of defence\r\n      that the strength of the place or that of the garrison could\r\n      afford, secretly escaped from Verona, anxious not for his own,\r\n      but for the public safety. With indefatigable diligence he soon\r\n      collected an army sufficient either to meet Constantine in the\r\n      field, or to attack him if he obstinately remained within his\r\n      lines. The emperor, attentive to the motions, and informed of the\r\n      approach of so formidable an enemy, left a part of his legions to\r\n      continue the operations of the siege, whilst, at the head of\r\n      those troops on whose valor and fidelity he more particularly\r\n      depended, he advanced in person to engage the general of\r\n      Maxentius. The army of Gaul was drawn up in two lines, according\r\n      to the usual practice of war; but their experienced leader,\r\n      perceiving that the numbers of the Italians far exceeded his own,\r\n      suddenly changed his disposition, and, reducing the second,\r\n      extended the front of his first line to a just proportion with\r\n      that of the enemy. Such evolutions, which only veteran troops can\r\n      execute without confusion in a moment of danger, commonly prove\r\n      decisive; but as this engagement began towards the close of the\r\n      day, and was contested with great obstinacy during the whole\r\n      night, there was less room for the conduct of the generals than\r\n      for the courage of the soldiers. The return of light displayed\r\n      the victory of Constantine, and a field of carnage covered with\r\n      many thousands of the vanquished Italians. Their general,\r\n      Pompeianus, was found among the slain; Verona immediately\r\n      surrendered at discretion, and the garrison was made prisoners of\r\n      war. 58 When the officers of the victorious army congratulated\r\n      their master on this important success, they ventured to add some\r\n      respectful complaints, of such a nature, however, as the most\r\n      jealous monarchs will listen to without displeasure. They\r\n      represented to Constantine, that, not contented with all the\r\n      duties of a commander, he had exposed his own person with an\r\n      excess of valor which almost degenerated into rashness; and they\r\n      conjured him for the future to pay more regard to the\r\n      preservation of a life in which the safety of Rome and of the\r\n      empire was involved. 59\r\n\r\n      57 (return) [ The Marquis Maffei has examined the siege and\r\n      battle of Verona with that degree of attention and accuracy which\r\n      was due to a memorable action that happened in his native\r\n      country.

Vet. ix. 11.]\r\n\r\n      While Constantine signalized his conduct and valor in the field,\r\n      the sovereign of Italy appeared insensible of the calamities and\r\n      danger of a civil war which reigned in the heart of his\r\n      dominions. Pleasure was still the only business of Maxentius.\r\n      Concealing, or at least attempting to conceal, from the public\r\n      knowledge the misfortunes of his arms, 60 he indulged himself in\r\n      a vain confidence which deferred the remedies of the approaching\r\n      evil, without deferring the evil itself. 61 The rapid progress of\r\n      Constantine 62 was scarcely sufficient to awaken him from his\r\n      fatal security; he flattered himself, that his well-known\r\n      liberality, and the majesty of the Roman name, which had already\r\n      delivered him from two invasions, would dissipate with the same\r\n      facility the rebellious army of Gaul. The officers of experience\r\n      and ability, who had served under the banners of Maximian, were\r\n      at length compelled to inform his effeminate son of the imminent\r\n      danger to which he was reduced; and, with a freedom that at once\r\n      surprised and convinced him, to urge the necessity of preventing\r\n      his ruin by a vigorous exertion of his remaining power. The\r\n      resources of Maxentius, both of men and money, were still\r\n      considerable. The Prætorian guards felt how strongly their own\r\n      interest and safety were connected with his cause; and a third\r\n      army was soon collected, more numerous than those which had been\r\n      lost in the battles of Turin and Verona. It was far from the\r\n      intention of the emperor to lead his troops in person. A stranger\r\n      to the exercises of war, he trembled at the apprehension of so\r\n      dangerous a contest; and as fear is commonly superstitious, he\r\n      listened with melancholy attention to the rumors of omens and\r\n      presages which seemed to menace his life and empire. Shame at\r\n      length supplied the place of courage, and forced him to take the\r\n      field. He was unable to sustain the contempt of the Roman people.\r\n      The circus resounded with their indignant clamors, and they\r\n      tumultuously besieged the gates of the palace, reproaching the\r\n      pusillanimity of their indolent sovereign, and celebrating the\r\n      heroic spirit of Constantine. 63 Before Maxentius left Rome, he\r\n      consulted the Sibylline books. The guardians of these ancient\r\n      oracles were as well versed in the arts of this world as they\r\n      were ignorant of the secrets of fate; and they returned him a\r\n      very prudent answer, which might adapt itself to the event, and\r\n      secure their reputation, whatever should be the chance of arms.\r\n      64\r\n\r\n      60 (return) [ Literas calamitatum suarum indices supprimebat.\r\n      Panegyr Vet. ix. 15.]\r\n\r\n      61 (return) [ Remedia malorum potius quam mala differebat, is the\r\n      fine censure which Tacitus passes on the supine indolence of\r\n      Vitellius.]\r\n\r\n      62 (return) [ The Marquis Maffei has made it extremely probable\r\n      that Constantine was still at Verona, the 1st of September, A.D.\r\n      312, and that the memorable æra of the indications was dated from\r\n      his conquest of the Cisalpine Gaul.]\r\n\r\n      63 (return) [ See Panegyr.

The\r\n      vanquished became of course the enemy of Rome.]\r\n\r\n      The celerity of Constantine’s march has been compared to the\r\n      rapid conquest of Italy by the first of the Cæsars; nor is the\r\n      flattering parallel repugnant to the truth of history, since no\r\n      more than fifty-eight days elapsed between the surrender of\r\n      Verona and the final decision of the war. Constantine had always\r\n      apprehended that the tyrant would consult the dictates of fear,\r\n      and perhaps of prudence; and that, instead of risking his last\r\n      hopes in a general engagement, he would shut himself up within\r\n      the walls of Rome. His ample magazines secured him against the\r\n      danger of famine; and as the situation of Constantine admitted\r\n      not of delay, he might have been reduced to the sad necessity of\r\n      destroying with fire and sword the Imperial city, the noblest\r\n      reward of his victory, and the deliverance of which had been the\r\n      motive, or rather indeed the pretence, of the civil war. 65 It\r\n      was with equal surprise and pleasure, that on his arrival at a\r\n      place called Saxa Rubra, about nine miles from Rome, 66 he\r\n      discovered the army of Maxentius prepared to give him battle. 67\r\n      Their long front filled a very spacious plain, and their deep\r\n      array reached to the banks of the Tyber, which covered their\r\n      rear, and forbade their retreat. We are informed, and we may\r\n      believe, that Constantine disposed his troops with consummate\r\n      skill, and that he chose for himself the post of honor and\r\n      danger. Distinguished by the splendor of his arms, he charged in\r\n      person the cavalry of his rival; and his irresistible attack\r\n      determined the fortune of the day. The cavalry of Maxentius was\r\n      principally composed either of unwieldy cuirassiers, or of light\r\n      Moors and Numidians. They yielded to the vigor of the Gallic\r\n      horse, which possessed more activity than the one, more firmness\r\n      than the other. The defeat of the two wings left the infantry\r\n      without any protection on its flanks, and the undisciplined\r\n      Italians fled without reluctance from the standard of a tyrant\r\n      whom they had always hated, and whom they no longer feared. The\r\n      Prætorians, conscious that their offences were beyond the reach\r\n      of mercy, were animated by revenge and despair. Notwithstanding\r\n      their repeated efforts, those brave veterans were unable to\r\n      recover the victory: they obtained, however, an honorable death;\r\n      and it was observed that their bodies covered the same ground\r\n      which had been occupied by their ranks. 68 The confusion then\r\n      became general, and the dismayed troops of Maxentius, pursued by\r\n      an implacable enemy, rushed by thousands into the deep and rapid\r\n      stream of the Tyber. The emperor himself attempted to escape back\r\n      into the city over the Milvian bridge; but the crowds which\r\n      pressed together through that narrow passage forced him into the\r\n      river, where he was immediately drowned by the weight of his\r\n      armor. 69 His body, which had sunk very deep into the mud, was\r\n      found with some difficulty the next day. The sight of his head,\r\n      when it was exposed to the eyes of the people, convinced them of\r\n      their deliverance, and admonished them to receive with\r\n      acclamations of loyalty and gratitude the fortunate Constantine,\r\n      who thus achieved by his valor and ability the most splendid\r\n      enterprise of his life. 70\r\n\r\n      65 (return) [ See Panegyr.

M. de Tillemont (Hist.\r\n      des Empereurs, tom. iv. part i. p. 576) very seriously examines\r\n      whether, in contradiction to common sense, the testimony of\r\n      Eusebius and Zosimus ought to prevail over the silence of\r\n      Lactantius, Nazarius, and the anonymous, but contemporary orator,\r\n      who composed the ninth Panegyric. * Note: Manso (Beylage, vi.)\r\n      examines the question, and adduces two manifest allusions to the\r\n      bridge, from the Life of Constantine by Praxagoras, and from\r\n      Libanius. Is it not very probable that such a bridge was thrown\r\n      over the river to facilitate the advance, and to secure the\r\n      retreat, of the army of Maxentius? In case of defeat, orders were\r\n      given for destroying it, in order to check the pursuit: it broke\r\n      down accidentally, or in the confusion was destroyed, as has not\r\n      unfrequently been the case, before the proper time.—M.]\r\n\r\n      70 (return) [ Zosimus, l. ii. p. 86-88, and the two Panegyrics,\r\n      the former of which was pronounced a few months afterwards,\r\n      afford the clearest notion of this great battle. Lactantius,\r\n      Eusebius, and even the Epitomes, supply several useful hints.]\r\n\r\n      In the use of victory, Constantine neither deserved the praise of\r\n      clemency, nor incurred the censure of immoderate rigor. 71 He\r\n      inflicted the same treatment to which a defeat would have exposed\r\n      his own person and family, put to death the two sons of the\r\n      tyrant, and carefully extirpated his whole race. The most\r\n      distinguished adherents of Maxentius must have expected to share\r\n      his fate, as they had shared his prosperity and his crimes; but\r\n      when the Roman people loudly demanded a greater number of\r\n      victims, the conqueror resisted, with firmness and humanity,\r\n      those servile clamors, which were dictated by flattery as well as\r\n      by resentment. Informers were punished and discouraged; the\r\n      innocent, who had suffered under the late tyranny, were recalled\r\n      from exile, and restored to their estates. A general act of\r\n      oblivion quieted the minds and settled the property of the\r\n      people, both in Italy and in Africa. 72 The first time that\r\n      Constantine honored the senate with his presence, he\r\n      recapitulated his own services and exploits in a modest oration,\r\n      assured that illustrious order of his sincere regard, and\r\n      promised to reëstablish its ancient dignity and privileges. The\r\n      grateful senate repaid these unmeaning professions by the empty\r\n      titles of honor, which it was yet in their power to bestow; and\r\n      without presuming to ratify the authority of Constantine, they\r\n      passed a decree to assign him the first rank among the three\r\n      _Augusti_ who governed the Roman world. 73 Games and festivals\r\n      were instituted to preserve the fame of his victory, and several\r\n      edifices, raised at the expense of Maxentius, were dedicated to\r\n      the honor of his successful rival. The triumphal arch of\r\n      Constantine still remains a melancholy proof of the decline of\r\n      the arts, and a singular testimony of the meanest vanity. As it\r\n      was not possible to find in the capital of the empire a sculptor\r\n      who was capable of adorning that public monument, the arch of\r\n      Trajan, without any respect either for his memory or for the\r\n      rules of propriety, was stripped of its most elegant figures. The\r\n      difference of times and persons, of actions and characters, was\r\n      totally disregarded. The Parthian captives appear prostrate at\r\n      the feet of a prince who never carried his arms beyond the\r\n      Euphrates; and curious antiquarians can still discover the head\r\n      of Trajan on the trophies of Constantine. The new ornaments which\r\n      it was necessary to introduce between the vacancies of ancient\r\n      sculpture are executed in the rudest and most unskilful manner.\r\n      74\r\n\r\n      71 (return) [ Zosimus, the enemy of Constantine, allows (l. ii.\r\n      p. 88) that only a few of the friends of Maxentius were put to\r\n      death; but we may remark the expressive passage of Nazarius,\r\n      (Panegyr.

Those haughty troops, whose\r\n      numbers and privileges had been restored, and even augmented, by\r\n      Maxentius, were forever suppressed by Constantine. Their\r\n      fortified camp was destroyed, and the few Prætorians who had\r\n      escaped the fury of the sword were dispersed among the legions,\r\n      and banished to the frontiers of the empire, where they might be\r\n      serviceable without again becoming dangerous. 75 By suppressing\r\n      the troops which were usually stationed in Rome, Constantine gave\r\n      the fatal blow to the dignity of the senate and people, and the\r\n      disarmed capital was exposed without protection to the insults or\r\n      neglect of its distant master. We may observe, that in this last\r\n      effort to preserve their expiring freedom, the Romans, from the\r\n      apprehension of a tribute, had raised Maxentius to the throne. He\r\n      exacted that tribute from the senate under the name of a free\r\n      gift. They implored the assistance of Constantine. He vanquished\r\n      the tyrant, and converted the free gift into a perpetual tax. The\r\n      senators, according to the declaration which was required of\r\n      their property, were divided into several classes. The most\r\n      opulent paid annually eight pounds of gold, the next class paid\r\n      four, the last two, and those whose poverty might have claimed an\r\n      exemption, were assessed, however, at seven pieces of gold.\r\n      Besides the regular members of the senate, their sons, their\r\n      descendants, and even their relations, enjoyed the vain\r\n      privileges, and supported the heavy burdens, of the senatorial\r\n      order; nor will it any longer excite our surprise, that\r\n      Constantine should be attentive to increase the number of persons\r\n      who were included under so useful a description. 76 After the\r\n      defeat of Maxentius, the victorious emperor passed no more than\r\n      two or three months in Rome, which he visited twice during the\r\n      remainder of his life, to celebrate the solemn festivals of the\r\n      tenth and of the twentieth years of his reign. Constantine was\r\n      almost perpetually in motion, to exercise the legions, or to\r\n      inspect the state of the provinces. Treves, Milan, Aquileia,\r\n      Sirmium, Naissus, and Thessalonica, were the occasional places of\r\n      his residence, till he founded a new Rome on the confines of\r\n      Europe and Asia. 77\r\n\r\n      75 (return) [ Prætoriæ legiones ac subsidia factionibus aptiora\r\n      quam urbi Romæ, sublata penitus; simul arma atque usus indumenti\r\n      militaris Aurelius Victor.

He had promised his sister Constantia in marriage to\r\n      that prince; but the celebration of the nuptials was deferred\r\n      till after the conclusion of the war, and the interview of the\r\n      two emperors at Milan, which was appointed for that purpose,\r\n      appeared to cement the union of their families and interests. 78\r\n      In the midst of the public festivity they were suddenly obliged\r\n      to take leave of each other. An inroad of the Franks summoned\r\n      Constantine to the Rhine, and the hostile approach of the\r\n      sovereign of Asia demanded the immediate presence of Licinius.\r\n      Maximin had been the secret ally of Maxentius, and without being\r\n      discouraged by his fate, he resolved to try the fortune of a\r\n      civil war. He moved out of Syria, towards the frontiers of\r\n      Bithynia, in the depth of winter. The season was severe and\r\n      tempestuous; great numbers of men as well as horses perished in\r\n      the snow; and as the roads were broken up by incessant rains, he\r\n      was obliged to leave behind him a considerable part of the heavy\r\n      baggage, which was unable to follow the rapidity of his forced\r\n      marches. By this extraordinary effort of diligence, he arrived\r\n      with a harassed but formidable army, on the banks of the Thracian\r\n      Bosphorus before the lieutenants of Licinius were apprised of his\r\n      hostile intentions. Byzantium surrendered to the power of\r\n      Maximin, after a siege of eleven days. He was detained some days\r\n      under the walls of Heraclea; and he had no sooner taken\r\n      possession of that city than he was alarmed by the intelligence\r\n      that Licinius had pitched his camp at the distance of only\r\n      eighteen miles. After a fruitless negotiation, in which the two\r\n      princes attempted to seduce the fidelity of each other’s\r\n      adherents, they had recourse to arms. The emperor of the East\r\n      commanded a disciplined and veteran army of above seventy\r\n      thousand men; and Licinius, who had collected about thirty\r\n      thousand Illyrians, was at first oppressed by the superiority of\r\n      numbers. His military skill, and the firmness of his troops,\r\n      restored the day, and obtained a decisive victory. The incredible\r\n      speed which Maximin exerted in his flight is much more celebrated\r\n      than his prowess in the battle. Twenty-four hours afterwards he\r\n      was seen, pale, trembling, and without his Imperial ornaments, at\r\n      Nicomedia, one hundred and sixty miles from the place of his\r\n      defeat. The wealth of Asia was yet unexhausted; and though the\r\n      flower of his veterans had fallen in the late action, he had\r\n      still power, if he could obtain time, to draw very numerous\r\n      levies from Syria and Egypt. But he survived his misfortune only\r\n      three or four months. His death, which happened at Tarsus, was\r\n      variously ascribed to despair, to poison, and to the divine\r\n      justice. As Maximin was alike destitute of abilities and of\r\n      virtue, he was lamented neither by the people nor by the\r\n      soldiers. The provinces of the East, delivered from the terrors\r\n      of civil war, cheerfully acknowledged the authority of Licinius.\r\n      79\r\n\r\n      78 (return) [ Zosimus (l. ii. p. 89) observes, that before the\r\n      war the sister of Constantine had been betrothed to Licinius.\r\n      According to the younger Victor, Diocletian was invited to the\r\n      nuptials; but having ventured to plead his age and infirmities,\r\n      he received a second letter, filled with reproaches for his\r\n      supposed partiality to the cause of Maxentius and Maximin.]\r\n\r\n      79 (return) [ Zosimus mentions the defeat and death of Maximin as\r\n      ordinary events; but Lactantius expatiates on them, (de M. P. c.\r\n      45-50,) ascribing them to the miraculous interposition of Heaven.\r\n      Licinius at that time was one of the protectors of the church.]\r\n\r\n      The vanquished emperor left behind him two children, a boy of\r\n      about eight, and a girl of about seven, years old. Their\r\n      inoffensive age might have excited compassion; but the compassion\r\n      of Licinius was a very feeble resource, nor did it restrain him\r\n      from _extinguishing_ the name and memory of his adversary. The\r\n      death of Severianus will admit of less excuse, as it was dictated\r\n      neither by revenge nor by policy. The conqueror had never\r\n      received any injury from the father of that unhappy youth, and\r\n      the short and obscure reign of Severus, in a distant part of the\r\n      empire, was already forgotten. But the execution of Candidianus\r\n      was an act of the blackest cruelty and ingratitude. He was the\r\n      natural son of Galerius, the friend and benefactor of Licinius.\r\n      The prudent father had judged him too young to sustain the weight\r\n      of a diadem; but he hoped that, under the protection of princes\r\n      who were indebted to his favor for the Imperial purple,\r\n      Candidianus might pass a secure and honorable life. He was now\r\n      advancing towards the twentieth year of his age, and the royalty\r\n      of his birth, though unsupported either by merit or ambition, was\r\n      sufficient to exasperate the jealous mind of Licinius. 80 To\r\n      these innocent and illustrious victims of his tyranny, we must\r\n      add the wife and daughter of the emperor Diocletian. When that\r\n      prince conferred on Galerius the title of Cæsar, he had given him\r\n      in marriage his daughter Valeria, whose melancholy adventures\r\n      might furnish a very singular subject for tragedy. She had\r\n      fulfilled and even surpassed the duties of a wife. As she had not\r\n      any children herself, she condescended to adopt the illegitimate\r\n      son of her husband, and invariably displayed towards the unhappy\r\n      Candidianus the tenderness and anxiety of a real mother. After\r\n      the death of Galerius, her ample possessions provoked the\r\n      avarice, and her personal attractions excited the desires, of his\r\n      successor, Maximin. 81 He had a wife still alive; but divorce was\r\n      permitted by the Roman law, and the fierce passions of the tyrant\r\n      demanded an immediate gratification. The answer of Valeria was\r\n      such as became the daughter and widow of emperors; but it was\r\n      tempered by the prudence which her defenceless condition\r\n      compelled her to observe. She represented to the persons whom\r\n      Maximin had employed on this occasion, “that even if honor could\r\n      permit a woman of her character and dignity to entertain a\r\n      thought of second nuptials, decency at least must forbid her to\r\n      listen to his addresses at a time when the ashes of her husband\r\n      and his benefactor were still warm, and while the sorrows of her\r\n      mind were still expressed by her mourning garments. She ventured\r\n      to declare, that she could place very little confidence in the\r\n      professions of a man whose cruel inconstancy was capable of\r\n      repudiating a faithful and affectionate wife.” 82 On this\r\n      repulse, the love of Maximin was converted into fury; and as\r\n      witnesses and judges were always at his disposal, it was easy for\r\n      him to cover his fury with an appearance of legal proceedings,\r\n      and to assault the reputation as well as the happiness of\r\n      Valeria. Her estates were confiscated, her eunuchs and domestics\r\n      devoted to the most inhuman tortures; and several innocent and\r\n      respectable matrons, who were honored with her friendship,\r\n      suffered death, on a false accusation of adultery. The empress\r\n      herself, together with her mother Prisca, was condemned to exile;\r\n      and as they were ignominiously hurried from place to place before\r\n      they were confined to a sequestered village in the deserts of\r\n      Syria, they exposed their shame and distress to the provinces of\r\n      the East, which, during thirty years, had respected their august\r\n      dignity. Diocletian made several ineffectual efforts to alleviate\r\n      the misfortunes of his daughter; and, as the last return that he\r\n      expected for the Imperial purple, which he had conferred upon\r\n      Maximin, he entreated that Valeria might be permitted to share\r\n      his retirement of Salona, and to close the eyes of her afflicted\r\n      father. 83 He entreated; but as he could no longer threaten, his\r\n      prayers were received with coldness and disdain; and the pride of\r\n      Maximin was gratified, in treating Diocletian as a suppliant, and\r\n      his daughter as a criminal. The death of Maximin seemed to assure\r\n      the empresses of a favorable alteration in their fortune. The\r\n      public disorders relaxed the vigilance of their guard, and they\r\n      easily found means to escape from the place of their exile, and\r\n      to repair, though with some precaution, and in disguise, to the\r\n      court of Licinius. His behavior, in the first days of his reign,\r\n      and the honorable reception which he gave to young Candidianus,\r\n      inspired Valeria with a secret satisfaction, both on her own\r\n      account and on that of her adopted son. But these grateful\r\n      prospects were soon succeeded by horror and astonishment; and the\r\n      bloody executions which stained the palace of Nicomedia\r\n      sufficiently convinced her that the throne of Maximin was filled\r\n      by a tyrant more inhuman than himself. Valeria consulted her\r\n      safety by a hasty flight, and, still accompanied by her mother\r\n      Prisca, they wandered above fifteen months 84 through the\r\n      provinces, concealed in the disguise of plebeian habits. They\r\n      were at length discovered at Thessalonica; and as the sentence of\r\n      their death was already pronounced, they were immediately\r\n      beheaded, and their bodies thrown into the sea. The people gazed\r\n      on the melancholy spectacle; but their grief and indignation were\r\n      suppressed by the terrors of a military guard. Such was the\r\n      unworthy fate of the wife and daughter of Diocletian. We lament\r\n      their misfortunes, we cannot discover their crimes; and whatever\r\n      idea we may justly entertain of the cruelty of Licinius, it\r\n      remains a matter of surprise that he was not contented with some\r\n      more secret and decent method of revenge. 85\r\n\r\n      80 (return) [ Lactantius de M.

It might perhaps have been expected that the conquerors,\r\n      fatigued with civil war, and connected by a private as well as\r\n      public alliance, would have renounced, or at least would have\r\n      suspended, any further designs of ambition. And yet a year had\r\n      scarcely elapsed after the death of Maximin, before the\r\n      victorious emperors turned their arms against each other. The\r\n      genius, the success, and the aspiring temper of Constantine, may\r\n      seem to mark him out as the aggressor; but the perfidious\r\n      character of Licinius justifies the most unfavorable suspicions,\r\n      and by the faint light which history reflects on this\r\n      transaction, 86 we may discover a conspiracy fomented by his arts\r\n      against the authority of his colleague. Constantine had lately\r\n      given his sister Anastasia in marriage to Bassianus, a man of a\r\n      considerable family and fortune, and had elevated his new kinsman\r\n      to the rank of Cæsar. According to the system of government\r\n      instituted by Diocletian, Italy, and perhaps Africa, were\r\n      designed for his department in the empire. But the performance of\r\n      the promised favor was either attended with so much delay, or\r\n      accompanied with so many unequal conditions, that the fidelity of\r\n      Bassianus was alienated rather than secured by the honorable\r\n      distinction which he had obtained. His nomination had been\r\n      ratified by the consent of Licinius; and that artful prince, by\r\n      the means of his emissaries, soon contrived to enter into a\r\n      secret and dangerous correspondence with the new Cæsar, to\r\n      irritate his discontents, and to urge him to the rash enterprise\r\n      of extorting by violence what he might in vain solicit from the\r\n      justice of Constantine. But the vigilant emperor discovered the\r\n      conspiracy before it was ripe for execution; and after solemnly\r\n      renouncing the alliance of Bassianus, despoiled him of the\r\n      purple, and inflicted the deserved punishment on his treason and\r\n      ingratitude. The haughty refusal of Licinius, when he was\r\n      required to deliver up the criminals who had taken refuge in his\r\n      dominions, confirmed the suspicions already entertained of his\r\n      perfidy; and the indignities offered at Æmona, on the frontiers\r\n      of Italy, to the statues of Constantine, became the signal of\r\n      discord between the two princes. 87\r\n\r\n      86 (return) [ The curious reader, who consults the Valesian\r\n      fragment, p. 713, will probably accuse me of giving a bold and\r\n      licentious paraphrase; but if he considers it with attention, he\r\n      will acknowledge that my interpretation is probable and\r\n      consistent.]\r\n\r\n      87 (return) [ The situation of Æmona, or, as it is now called,\r\n      Laybach, in Carniola, (D’Anville, Geographie Ancienne, tom. i. p.\r\n      187,) may suggest a conjecture. As it lay to the north-east of\r\n      the Julian Alps, that important territory became a natural object\r\n      of dispute between the sovereigns of Italy and of Illyricum.]\r\n\r\n      The first battle was fought near Cibalis, a city of Pannonia,\r\n      situated on the River Save, about fifty miles above Sirmium. 88\r\n      From the inconsiderable forces which in this important contest\r\n      two such powerful monarchs brought into the field, it may be\r\n      inferred that the one was suddenly provoked, and that the other\r\n      was unexpectedly surprised. The emperor of the West had only\r\n      twenty thousand, and the sovereign of the East no more than five\r\n      and thirty thousand, men. The inferiority of number was, however,\r\n      compensated by the advantage of the ground. Constantine had taken\r\n      post in a defile about half a mile in breadth, between a steep\r\n      hill and a deep morass, and in that situation he steadily\r\n      expected and repulsed the first attack of the enemy. He pursued\r\n      his success, and advanced into the plain. But the veteran legions\r\n      of Illyricum rallied under the standard of a leader who had been\r\n      trained to arms in the school of Probus and Diocletian. The\r\n      missile weapons on both sides were soon exhausted; the two\r\n      armies, with equal valor, rushed to a closer engagement of swords\r\n      and spears, and the doubtful contest had already lasted from the\r\n      dawn of the day to a late hour of the evening, when the right\r\n      wing, which Constantine led in person, made a vigorous and\r\n      decisive charge. The judicious retreat of Licinius saved the\r\n      remainder of his troops from a total defeat; but when he computed\r\n      his loss, which amounted to more than twenty thousand men, he\r\n      thought it unsafe to pass the night in the presence of an active\r\n      and victorious enemy. Abandoning his camp and magazines, he\r\n      marched away with secrecy and diligence at the head of the\r\n      greatest part of his cavalry, and was soon removed beyond the\r\n      danger of a pursuit. His diligence preserved his wife, his son,\r\n      and his treasures, which he had deposited at Sirmium. Licinius\r\n      passed through that city, and breaking down the bridge on the\r\n      Save, hastened to collect a new army in Dacia and Thrace. In his\r\n      flight he bestowed the precarious title of Cæsar on Valens, his\r\n      general of the Illyrian frontier. 89\r\n\r\n      88 (return) [ Cibalis or Cibalæ (whose name is still preserved in\r\n      the obscure ruins of Swilei) was situated about fifty miles from\r\n      Sirmium, the capital of Illyricum, and about one hundred from\r\n      Taurunum, or Belgrade, and the conflux of the Danube and the\r\n      Save.

The troops on both\r\n      sides displayed the same valor and discipline; and the victory\r\n      was once more decided by the superior abilities of Constantine,\r\n      who directed a body of five thousand men to gain an advantageous\r\n      height, from whence, during the heat of the action, they attacked\r\n      the rear of the enemy, and made a very considerable slaughter.\r\n      The troops of Licinius, however, presenting a double front, still\r\n      maintained their ground, till the approach of night put an end to\r\n      the combat, and secured their retreat towards the mountains of\r\n      Macedonia. 90 The loss of two battles, and of his bravest\r\n      veterans, reduced the fierce spirit of Licinius to sue for peace.\r\n      His ambassador Mistrianus was admitted to the audience of\r\n      Constantine: he expatiated on the common topics of moderation and\r\n      humanity, which are so familiar to the eloquence of the\r\n      vanquished; represented in the most insinuating language, that\r\n      the event of the war was still doubtful, whilst its inevitable\r\n      calamities were alike pernicious to both the contending parties;\r\n      and declared that he was authorized to propose a lasting and\r\n      honorable peace in the name of the _two_ emperors his masters.\r\n      Constantine received the mention of Valens with indignation and\r\n      contempt. “It was not for such a purpose,” he sternly replied,\r\n      “that we have advanced from the shores of the western ocean in an\r\n      uninterrupted course of combats and victories, that, after\r\n      rejecting an ungrateful kinsman, we should accept for our\r\n      colleague a contemptible slave. The abdication of Valens is the\r\n      first article of the treaty.” 91 It was necessary to accept this\r\n      humiliating condition; and the unhappy Valens, after a reign of a\r\n      few days, was deprived of the purple and of his life. As soon as\r\n      this obstacle was removed, the tranquillity of the Roman world\r\n      was easily restored. The successive defeats of Licinius had\r\n      ruined his forces, but they had displayed his courage and\r\n      abilities. His situation was almost desperate, but the efforts of\r\n      despair are sometimes formidable, and the good sense of\r\n      Constantine preferred a great and certain advantage to a third\r\n      trial of the chance of arms. He consented to leave his rival, or,\r\n      as he again styled Licinius, his friend and brother, in the\r\n      possession of Thrace, Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt; but the\r\n      provinces of Pannonia, Dalmatia, Dacia, Macedonia, and Greece,\r\n      were yielded to the Western empire, and the dominions of\r\n      Constantine now extended from the confines of Caledonia to the\r\n      extremity of Peloponnesus. It was stipulated by the same treaty,\r\n      that three royal youths, the sons of emperors, should be called\r\n      to the hopes of the succession. Crispus and the young Constantine\r\n      were soon afterwards declared Cæsars in the West, while the\r\n      younger Licinius was invested with the same dignity in the East.\r\n      In this double proportion of honors, the conqueror asserted the\r\n      superiority of his arms and power. 92\r\n\r\n      90 (return) [ Zosimus, l. ii. p. 92, 93.

Four of these writers affirm that the promotion of the\r\n      Cæsars was an article of the treaty. It is, however, certain,\r\n      that the younger Constantine and Licinius were not yet born; and\r\n      it is highly probable that the promotion was made the 1st of\r\n      March, A. D. 317. The treaty had probably stipulated that the two\r\n      Cæsars might be created by the western, and one only by the\r\n      eastern emperor; but each of them reserved to himself the choice\r\n      of the persons.]\r\n\r\n      The reconciliation of Constantine and Licinius, though it was\r\n      imbittered by resentment and jealousy, by the remembrance of\r\n      recent injuries, and by the apprehension of future dangers,\r\n      maintained, however, above eight years, the tranquility of the\r\n      Roman world. As a very regular series of the Imperial laws\r\n      commences about this period, it would not be difficult to\r\n      transcribe the civil regulations which employed the leisure of\r\n      Constantine. But the most important of his institutions are\r\n      intimately connected with the new system of policy and religion,\r\n      which was not perfectly established till the last and peaceful\r\n      years of his reign. There are many of his laws, which, as far as\r\n      they concern the rights and property of individuals, and the\r\n      practice of the bar, are more properly referred to the private\r\n      than to the public jurisprudence of the empire; and he published\r\n      many edicts of so local and temporary a nature, that they would\r\n      ill deserve the notice of a general history. Two laws, however,\r\n      may be selected from the crowd; the one for its importance, the\r\n      other for its singularity; the former for its remarkable\r\n      benevolence, the latter for its excessive severity. 1. The horrid\r\n      practice, so familiar to the ancients, of exposing or murdering\r\n      their new-born infants, was become every day more frequent in the\r\n      provinces, and especially in Italy. It was the effect of\r\n      distress; and the distress was principally occasioned by the\r\n      intolerant burden of taxes, and by the vexatious as well as cruel\r\n      prosecutions of the officers of the revenue against their\r\n      insolvent debtors. The less opulent or less industrious part of\r\n      mankind, instead of rejoicing in an increase of family, deemed it\r\n      an act of paternal tenderness to release their children from the\r\n      impending miseries of a life which they themselves were unable to\r\n      support. The humanity of Constantine, moved, perhaps, by some\r\n      recent and extraordinary instances of despair, engaged him to\r\n      address an edict to all the cities of Italy, and afterwards of\r\n      Africa, directing immediate and sufficient relief to be given to\r\n      those parents who should produce before the magistrates the\r\n      children whom their own poverty would not allow them to educate.\r\n      But the promise was too liberal, and the provision too vague, to\r\n      effect any general or permanent benefit. 93 The law, though it\r\n      may merit some praise, served rather to display than to alleviate\r\n      the public distress. It still remains an authentic monument to\r\n      contradict and confound those venal orators, who were too well\r\n      satisfied with their own situation to discover either vice or\r\n      misery under the government of a generous sovereign. 94 2. The\r\n      laws of Constantine against rapes were dictated with very little\r\n      indulgence for the most amiable weaknesses of human nature; since\r\n      the description of that crime was applied not only to the brutal\r\n      violence which compelled, but even to the gentle seduction which\r\n      might persuade, an unmarried woman, under the age of twenty-five,\r\n      to leave the house of her parents. “The successful ravisher was\r\n      punished with death;” and as if simple death was inadequate to\r\n      the enormity of his guilt, he was either burnt alive, or torn in\r\n      pieces by wild beasts in the amphitheatre. The virgin’s\r\n      declaration, that she had been carried away with her own consent,\r\n      instead of saving her lover, exposed her to share his fate. The\r\n      duty of a public prosecution was intrusted to the parents of the\r\n      guilty or unfortunate maid; and if the sentiments of nature\r\n      prevailed on them to dissemble the injury, and to repair by a\r\n      subsequent marriage the honor of their family, they were\r\n      themselves punished by exile and confiscation. The slaves,\r\n      whether male or female, who were convicted of having been\r\n      accessory to rape or seduction, were burnt alive, or put to death\r\n      by the ingenious torture of pouring down their throats a quantity\r\n      of melted lead. As the crime was of a public kind, the accusation\r\n      was permitted even to strangers.9401\r\n\r\n      9401 (return) [ This explanation appears to me little probable.\r\n      Godefroy has made a much more happy conjecture, supported by all\r\n      the historical circumstances which relate to this edict. It was\r\n      published the 12th of May, A. D. 315. at Naissus in Pannonia, the\r\n      birthplace of Constantine. The 8th of October, in that year,\r\n      Constantine gained the victory of Cibalis over Licinius. He was\r\n      yet uncertain as to the fate of the war: the Christians, no\r\n      doubt, whom he favored, had prophesied his victory. Lactantius,\r\n      then preceptor of Crispus, had just written his work upon\r\n      Christianity, (his Divine Institutes;) he had dedicated it to\r\n      Constantine. In this book he had inveighed with great force\r\n      against infanticide, and the exposure of infants, (l. vi. c. 20.)\r\n      Is it not probable that Constantine had read this work, that he\r\n      had conversed on the subject with Lactantius, that he was moved,\r\n      among other things, by the passage to which I have referred, and\r\n      in the first transport of his enthusiasm, he published the edict\r\n      in question? The whole of the edict bears the character of\r\n      precipitation, of excitement, (entrainement,) rather than of\r\n      deliberate reflection—the extent of the promises, the\r\n      indefiniteness of the means, of the conditions, and of the time\r\n      during which the parents might have a right to the succor of the\r\n      state. Is there not reason to believe that the humanity of\r\n      Constantine was excited by the influence of Lactantius, by that\r\n      of the principles of Christianity, and of the Christians\r\n      themselves, already in high esteem with the emperor, rather than\r\n      by some “extraordinary instances of despair”? * * * See\r\n      Hegewisch, Essai Hist. sur les Finances Romaines. The edict for\r\n      Africa was not published till 322: of that we may say in truth\r\n      that its origin was in the misery of the times. Africa had\r\n      suffered much from the cruelty of Maxentius. Constantine says\r\n      expressly, that he had learned that parents, under the pressure\r\n      of distress, were there selling their children. This decree is\r\n      more distinct, more maturely deliberated than the former; the\r\n      succor which was to be given to the parents, and the source from\r\n      which it was to be derived, are determined. (Code Theod. l. xi.\r\n      tit. 27, c 2.) If the direct utility of these laws may not have\r\n      been very extensive, they had at least the great and happy effect\r\n      of establishing a decisive opposition between the principles of\r\n      the government and those which, at this time, had prevailed among\r\n      the subjects of the empire.—G.]\r\n\r\n      The commencement of the action was not limited to any term of\r\n      years, and the consequences of the sentence were extended to the\r\n      innocent offspring of such an irregular union. 95 But whenever\r\n      the offence inspires less horror than the punishment, the rigor\r\n      of penal law is obliged to give way to the common feelings of\r\n      mankind. The most odious parts of this edict were softened or\r\n      repealed in the subsequent reigns; 96 and even Constantine\r\n      himself very frequently alleviated, by partial acts of mercy, the\r\n      stern temper of his general institutions. Such, indeed, was the\r\n      singular humor of that emperor, who showed himself as indulgent,\r\n      and even remiss, in the execution of his laws, as he was severe,\r\n      and even cruel, in the enacting of them. It is scarcely possible\r\n      to observe a more decisive symptom of weakness, either in the\r\n      character of the prince, or in the constitution of the\r\n      government. 97\r\n\r\n      93 (return) [ Codex Theodosian. l. xi. tit. 27, tom. iv. p. 188,\r\n      with Godefroy’s observations.

Crispus, a youth of the most\r\n      amiable character, who had received with the title of Cæsar the\r\n      command of the Rhine, distinguished his conduct, as well as\r\n      valor, in several victories over the Franks and Alemanni, and\r\n      taught the barbarians of that frontier to dread the eldest son of\r\n      Constantine, and the grandson of Constantius. 98 The emperor\r\n      himself had assumed the more difficult and important province of\r\n      the Danube. The Goths, who in the time of Claudius and Aurelian\r\n      had felt the weight of the Roman arms, respected the power of the\r\n      empire, even in the midst of its intestine divisions. But the\r\n      strength of that warlike nation was now restored by a peace of\r\n      near fifty years; a new generation had arisen, who no longer\r\n      remembered the misfortunes of ancient days; the Sarmatians of the\r\n      Lake Mæotis followed the Gothic standard either as subjects or as\r\n      allies, and their united force was poured upon the countries of\r\n      Illyricum. Campona, Margus, and Benonia, 982 appear to have been\r\n      the scenes of several memorable sieges and battles; 99 and though\r\n      Constantine encountered a very obstinate resistance, he prevailed\r\n      at length in the contest, and the Goths were compelled to\r\n      purchased an ignominious retreat, by restoring the booty and\r\n      prisoners which they had taken. Nor was this advantage sufficient\r\n      to satisfy the indignation of the emperor. He resolved to\r\n      chastise as well as to repulse the insolent barbarians who had\r\n      dared to invade the territories of Rome. At the head of his\r\n      legions he passed the Danube, after repairing the bridge which\r\n      had been constructed by Trajan, penetrated into the strongest\r\n      recesses of Dacia, 100 and when he had inflicted a severe\r\n      revenge, condescended to give peace to the suppliant Goths, on\r\n      condition that, as often as they were required, they should\r\n      supply his armies with a body of forty thousand soldiers. 101\r\n      Exploits like these were no doubt honorable to Constantine, and\r\n      beneficial to the state; but it may surely be questioned, whether\r\n      they can justify the exaggerated assertion of Eusebius, that ALL\r\n      SCYTHIA, as far as the extremity of the North, divided as it was\r\n      into so many names and nations of the most various and savage\r\n      manners, had been added by his victorious arms to the Roman\r\n      empire. 102\r\n\r\n      98 (return) [ Nazarius in Panegyr.

Calling forth that spirit\r\n      and those abilities by which he had deserved the friendship of\r\n      Galerius and the Imperial purple, he prepared himself for the\r\n      contest, collected the forces of the East, and soon filled the\r\n      plains of Hadrianople with his troops, and the straits of the\r\n      Hellespont with his fleet. The army consisted of one hundred and\r\n      fifty thousand foot, and fifteen thousand horse; and as the\r\n      cavalry was drawn, for the most part, from Phrygia and\r\n      Cappadocia, we may conceive a more favorable opinion of the\r\n      beauty of the horses, than of the courage and dexterity of their\r\n      riders. The fleet was composed of three hundred and fifty galleys\r\n      of three ranks of oars. A hundred and thirty of these were\r\n      furnished by Egypt and the adjacent coast of Africa. A hundred\r\n      and ten sailed from the ports of Phœnicia and the isle of Cyprus;\r\n      and the maritime countries of Bithynia, Ionia, and Caria were\r\n      likewise obliged to provide a hundred and ten galleys. The troops\r\n      of Constantine were ordered to a rendezvous at Thessalonica; they\r\n      amounted to above a hundred and twenty thousand horse and foot.\r\n      104 Their emperor was satisfied with their martial appearance,\r\n      and his army contained more soldiers, though fewer men, than that\r\n      of his eastern competitor. The legions of Constantine were levied\r\n      in the warlike provinces of Europe; action had confirmed their\r\n      discipline, victory had elevated their hopes, and there were\r\n      among them a great number of veterans, who, after seventeen\r\n      glorious campaigns under the same leader, prepared themselves to\r\n      deserve an honorable dismission by a last effort of their valor.\r\n      105 But the naval preparations of Constantine were in every\r\n      respect much inferior to those of Licinius. The maritime cities\r\n      of Greece sent their respective quotas of men and ships to the\r\n      celebrated harbor of Piræus, and their united forces consisted of\r\n      no more than two hundred small vessels—a very feeble armament, if\r\n      it is compared with those formidable fleets which were equipped\r\n      and maintained by the republic of Athens during the Peloponnesian\r\n      war. 106 Since Italy was no longer the seat of government, the\r\n      naval establishments of Misenum and Ravenna had been gradually\r\n      neglected; and as the shipping and mariners of the empire were\r\n      supported by commerce rather than by war, it was natural that\r\n      they should the most abound in the industrious provinces of Egypt\r\n      and Asia. It is only surprising that the eastern emperor, who\r\n      possessed so great a superiority at sea, should have neglected\r\n      the opportunity of carrying an offensive war into the centre of\r\n      his rival’s dominions.\r\n\r\n      103 (return) [ Constantinus tamen, vir ingens, et omnia efficere\r\n      nitens quæ animo præparasset, simul principatum totius urbis\r\n      affectans, Licinio bellum intulit.

See Thucydides de Bel.\r\n      Pelopon. l. ii. c. 13, and Meursius de Fortuna Attica, c. 19.]\r\n\r\n      Instead of embracing such an active resolution, which might have\r\n      changed the whole face of the war, the prudent Licinius expected\r\n      the approach of his rival in a camp near Hadrianople, which he\r\n      had fortified with an anxious care that betrayed his apprehension\r\n      of the event. Constantine directed his march from Thessalonica\r\n      towards that part of Thrace, till he found himself stopped by the\r\n      broad and rapid stream of the Hebrus, and discovered the numerous\r\n      army of Licinius, which filled the steep ascent of the hill, from\r\n      the river to the city of Hadrianople. Many days were spent in\r\n      doubtful and distant skirmishes; but at length the obstacles of\r\n      the passage and of the attack were removed by the intrepid\r\n      conduct of Constantine. In this place we might relate a wonderful\r\n      exploit of Constantine, which, though it can scarcely be\r\n      paralleled either in poetry or romance, is celebrated, not by a\r\n      venal orator devoted to his fortune, but by an historian, the\r\n      partial enemy of his fame. We are assured that the valiant\r\n      emperor threw himself into the River Hebrus, accompanied only by\r\n      _twelve_ horsemen, and that by the effort or terror of his\r\n      invincible arm, he broke, slaughtered, and put to flight a host\r\n      of a hundred and fifty thousand men. The credulity of Zosimus\r\n      prevailed so strongly over his passion, that among the events of\r\n      the memorable battle of Hadrianople, he seems to have selected\r\n      and embellished, not the most important, but the most marvellous.\r\n      The valor and danger of Constantine are attested by a slight\r\n      wound which he received in the thigh; but it may be discovered\r\n      even from an imperfect narration, and perhaps a corrupted text,\r\n      that the victory was obtained no less by the conduct of the\r\n      general than by the courage of the hero; that a body of five\r\n      thousand archers marched round to occupy a thick wood in the rear\r\n      of the enemy, whose attention was diverted by the construction of\r\n      a bridge, and that Licinius, perplexed by so many artful\r\n      evolutions, was reluctantly drawn from his advantageous post to\r\n      combat on equal ground on the plain. The contest was no longer\r\n      equal. His confused multitude of new levies was easily vanquished\r\n      by the experienced veterans of the West. Thirty-four thousand men\r\n      are reported to have been slain. The fortified camp of Licinius\r\n      was taken by assault the evening of the battle; the greater part\r\n      of the fugitives, who had retired to the mountains, surrendered\r\n      themselves the next day to the discretion of the conqueror; and\r\n      his rival, who could no longer keep the field, confined himself\r\n      within the walls of Byzantium. 107\r\n\r\n      107 (return) [ Zosimus, l. ii. p. 95, 96.

In\r\n      the late civil wars, the fortifications of that place, so justly\r\n      considered as the key of Europe and Asia, had been repaired and\r\n      strengthened; and as long as Licinius remained master of the sea,\r\n      the garrison was much less exposed to the danger of famine than\r\n      the army of the besiegers. The naval commanders of Constantine\r\n      were summoned to his camp, and received his positive orders to\r\n      force the passage of the Hellespont, as the fleet of Licinius,\r\n      instead of seeking and destroying their feeble enemy, continued\r\n      inactive in those narrow straits, where its superiority of\r\n      numbers was of little use or advantage. Crispus, the emperor’s\r\n      eldest son, was intrusted with the execution of this daring\r\n      enterprise, which he performed with so much courage and success,\r\n      that he deserved the esteem, and most probably excited the\r\n      jealousy, of his father. The engagement lasted two days; and in\r\n      the evening of the first, the contending fleets, after a\r\n      considerable and mutual loss, retired into their respective\r\n      harbors of Europe and Asia. The second day, about noon, a strong\r\n      south wind 108 sprang up, which carried the vessels of Crispus\r\n      against the enemy; and as the casual advantage was improved by\r\n      his skilful intrepidity, he soon obtained a complete victory. A\r\n      hundred and thirty vessels were destroyed, five thousand men were\r\n      slain, and Amandus, the admiral of the Asiatic fleet, escaped\r\n      with the utmost difficulty to the shores of Chalcedon. As soon as\r\n      the Hellespont was open, a plentiful convoy of provisions flowed\r\n      into the camp of Constantine, who had already advanced the\r\n      operations of the siege. He constructed artificial mounds of\r\n      earth of an equal height with the ramparts of Byzantium. The\r\n      lofty towers which were erected on that foundation galled the\r\n      besieged with large stones and darts from the military engines,\r\n      and the battering rams had shaken the walls in several places. If\r\n      Licinius persisted much longer in the defence, he exposed himself\r\n      to be involved in the ruin of the place. Before he was\r\n      surrounded, he prudently removed his person and treasures to\r\n      Chalcedon in Asia; and as he was always desirous of associating\r\n      companions to the hopes and dangers of his fortune, he now\r\n      bestowed the title of Cæsar on Martinianus, who exercised one of\r\n      the most important offices of the empire. 109\r\n\r\n      108 (return) [ Zosimus, l. ii. p. 97, 98. The current always sets\r\n      out of the Hellespont; and when it is assisted by a north wind,\r\n      no vessel can attempt the passage. A south wind renders the force\r\n      of the current almost imperceptible. See Tournefort’s Voyage au\r\n      Levant, Let. xi.]\r\n\r\n      109 (return) [ Aurelius Victor. Zosimus, l. ii. p. 93. According\r\n      to the latter, Martinianus was Magister Officiorum, (he uses the\r\n      Latin appellation in Greek.) Some medals seem to intimate, that\r\n      during his short reign he received the title of Augustus.]\r\n\r\n      Such were still the resources, and such the abilities, of\r\n      Licinius, that, after so many successive defeats, he collected in\r\n      Bithynia a new army of fifty or sixty thousand men, while the\r\n      activity of Constantine was employed in the siege of Byzantium.\r\n      The vigilant emperor did not, however, neglect the last struggles\r\n      of his antagonist. A considerable part of his victorious army was\r\n      transported over the Bosphorus in small vessels, and the decisive\r\n      engagement was fought soon after their landing on the heights of\r\n      Chrysopolis, or, as it is now called, of Scutari. The troops of\r\n      Licinius, though they were lately raised, ill armed, and worse\r\n      disciplined, made head against their conquerors with fruitless\r\n      but desperate valor, till a total defeat, and a slaughter of five\r\n      and twenty thousand men, irretrievably determined the fate of\r\n      their leader. 110 He retired to Nicomedia, rather with the view\r\n      of gaining some time for negotiation, than with the hope of any\r\n      effectual defence. Constantia, his wife, and the sister of\r\n      Constantine, interceded with her brother in favor of her husband,\r\n      and obtained from his policy, rather than from his compassion, a\r\n      solemn promise, confirmed by an oath, that after the sacrifice of\r\n      Martinianus, and the resignation of the purple, Licinius himself\r\n      should be permitted to pass the remainder of this life in peace\r\n      and affluence. The behavior of Constantia, and her relation to\r\n      the contending parties, naturally recalls the remembrance of that\r\n      virtuous matron who was the sister of Augustus, and the wife of\r\n      Antony. But the temper of mankind was altered, and it was no\r\n      longer esteemed infamous for a Roman to survive his honor and\r\n      independence. Licinius solicited and accepted the pardon of his\r\n      offences, laid himself and his purple at the feet of his _lord_\r\n      and _master_, was raised from the ground with insulting pity, was\r\n      admitted the same day to the Imperial banquet, and soon\r\n      afterwards was sent away to Thessalonica, which had been chosen\r\n      for the place of his confinement. 111 His confinement was soon\r\n      terminated by death, and it is doubtful whether a tumult of the\r\n      soldiers, or a decree of the senate, was suggested as the motive\r\n      for his execution. According to the rules of tyranny, he was\r\n      accused of forming a conspiracy, and of holding a treasonable\r\n      correspondence with the barbarians; but as he was never\r\n      convicted, either by his own conduct or by any legal evidence, we\r\n      may perhaps be allowed, from his weakness, to presume his\r\n      innocence. 112 The memory of Licinius was branded with infamy,\r\n      his statues were thrown down, and by a hasty edict, of such\r\n      mischievous tendency that it was almost immediately corrected,\r\n      all his laws, and all the judicial proceedings of his reign, were\r\n      at once abolished. 113 By this victory of Constantine, the Roman\r\n      world was again united under the authority of one emperor,\r\n      thirty-seven years after Diocletian had divided his power and\r\n      provinces with his associate Maximian.\r\n\r\n      110 (return) [ Eusebius (in Vita Constantin.

The causes\r\n      assigned, in the fifteenth chapter, for the diffusion of\r\n      Christianity, must, no doubt, have contributed to it materially;\r\n      but I doubt whether he saw them all.

Mackintosh see Life, i. p. 244.—M.]\r\n\r\n      A candid but rational inquiry into the progress and establishment\r\n      of Christianity may be considered as a very essential part of the\r\n      history of the Roman empire. While that great body was invaded by\r\n      open violence, or undermined by slow decay, a pure and humble\r\n      religion gently insinuated itself into the minds of men, grew up\r\n      in silence and obscurity, derived new vigor from opposition, and\r\n      finally erected the triumphant banner of the Cross on the ruins\r\n      of the Capitol. Nor was the influence of Christianity confined to\r\n      the period or to the limits of the Roman empire. After a\r\n      revolution of thirteen or fourteen centuries, that religion is\r\n      still professed by the nations of Europe, the most distinguished\r\n      portion of human kind in arts and learning as well as in arms. By\r\n      the industry and zeal of the Europeans, it has been widely\r\n      diffused to the most distant shores of Asia and Africa; and by\r\n      the means of their colonies has been firmly established from\r\n      Canada to Chili, in a world unknown to the ancients.\r\n\r\n      But this inquiry, however useful or entertaining, is attended\r\n      with two peculiar difficulties. The scanty and suspicious\r\n      materials of ecclesiastical history seldom enable us to dispel\r\n      the dark cloud that hangs over the first age of the church. The\r\n      great law of impartiality too often obliges us to reveal the\r\n      imperfections of the uninspired teachers and believers of the\r\n      gospel; and, to a careless observer, _their_ faults may seem to\r\n      cast a shade on the faith which they professed. But the scandal\r\n      of the pious Christian, and the fallacious triumph of the\r\n      Infidel, should cease as soon as they recollect not only _by\r\n      whom_, but likewise _to whom_, the Divine Revelation was given.\r\n      The theologian may indulge the pleasing task of describing\r\n      Religion as she descended from Heaven, arrayed in her native\r\n      purity. A more melancholy duty is imposed on the historian. He\r\n      must discover the inevitable mixture of error and corruption,\r\n      which she contracted in a long residence upon earth, among a weak\r\n      and degenerate race of beings. 102\r\n\r\n      102 (return) [ The art of Gibbon, or at least the unfair\r\n      impression produced by these two memorable chapters, consists in\r\n      confounding together, in one undistinguishable mass, the origin\r\n      and apostolic propagation of the Christian religion with its\r\n      later progress. The main question, the divine origin of the\r\n      religion, is dexterously eluded or speciously conceded; his plan\r\n      enables him to commence his account, in most parts, below the\r\n      apostolic times; and it is only by the strength of the dark\r\n      coloring with which he has brought out the failings and the\r\n      follies of succeeding ages, that a shadow of doubt and suspicion\r\n      is thrown back on the primitive period of Christianity. Divest\r\n      this whole passage of the latent sarcasm betrayed by the\r\n      subsequent one of the whole disquisition, and it might commence a\r\n      Christian history, written in the most Christian spirit of\r\n      candor.—M.]\r\n\r\n      Our curiosity is naturally prompted to inquire by what means the\r\n      Christian faith obtained so remarkable a victory over the\r\n      established religions of the earth. To this inquiry, an obvious\r\n      but satisfactory answer may be returned; that it was owing to the\r\n      convincing evidence of the doctrine itself, and to the ruling\r\n      providence of its great Author. But as truth and reason seldom\r\n      find so favorable a reception in the world, and as the wisdom of\r\n      Providence frequently condescends to use the passions of the\r\n      human heart, and the general circumstances of mankind, as\r\n      instruments to execute its purpose, we may still be permitted,\r\n      though with becoming submission, to ask, not indeed what were the\r\n      first, but what were the secondary causes of the rapid growth of\r\n      the Christian church. It will, perhaps, appear, that it was most\r\n      effectually favored and assisted by the five following causes:\r\n\r\n      I. The inflexible, and if we may use the expression, the\r\n      intolerant zeal of the Christians, derived, it is true, from the\r\n      Jewish religion, but purified from the narrow and unsocial\r\n      spirit, which, instead of inviting, had deterred the Gentiles\r\n      from embracing the law of Moses.1023\r\n\r\n      II. The doctrine of a future life, improved by every additional\r\n      circumstance which could give weight and efficacy to that\r\n      important truth. III. The miraculous powers ascribed to the\r\n      primitive church. IV. The pure and austere morals of the\r\n      Christians.\r\n\r\n      V. The union and discipline of the Christian republic, which\r\n      gradually formed an independent and increasing state in the heart\r\n      of the Roman empire.\r\n\r\n      1023 (return) [Though we are thus far agreed with respect to the\r\n      inflexibility and intolerance of Christian zeal, yet as to the\r\n      principle from which it was derived, we are, toto cœlo, divided\r\n      in opinion. You deduce it from the Jewish religion; I would refer\r\n      it to a more adequate and a more obvious source, a full\r\n      persuasion of the truth of Christianity. Watson. Letters Gibbon,\r\n      i. 9.—M.]\r\n\r\n      I. We have already described the religious harmony of the ancient\r\n      world, and the facility with which the most different and even\r\n      hostile nations embraced, or at least respected, each other’s\r\n      superstitions. A single people refused to join in the common\r\n      intercourse of mankind. The Jews, who, under the Assyrian and\r\n      Persian monarchies, had languished for many ages the most\r\n      despised portion of their slaves, 1 emerged from obscurity under\r\n      the successors of Alexander; and as they multiplied to a\r\n      surprising degree in the East, and afterwards in the West, they\r\n      soon excited the curiosity and wonder of other nations. 2 The\r\n      sullen obstinacy with which they maintained their peculiar rites\r\n      and unsocial manners seemed to mark them out as a distinct\r\n      species of men, who boldly professed, or who faintly disguised,\r\n      their implacable habits to the rest of human kind. 3 Neither the\r\n      violence of Antiochus, nor the arts of Herod, nor the example of\r\n      the circumjacent nations, could ever persuade the Jews to\r\n      associate with the institutions of Moses the elegant mythology of\r\n      the Greeks. 4 According to the maxims of universal toleration,\r\n      the Romans protected a superstition which they despised. 5 The\r\n      polite Augustus condescended to give orders, that sacrifices\r\n      should be offered for his prosperity in the temple of Jerusalem;\r\n      6 whilst the meanest of the posterity of Abraham, who should have\r\n      paid the same homage to the Jupiter of the Capitol, would have\r\n      been an object of abhorrence to himself and to his brethren.\r\n\r\n      But the moderation of the conquerors was insufficient to appease\r\n      the jealous prejudices of their subjects, who were alarmed and\r\n      scandalized at the ensigns of paganism, which necessarily\r\n      introduced themselves into a Roman province. 7 The mad attempt of\r\n      Caligula to place his own statue in the temple of Jerusalem was\r\n      defeated by the unanimous resolution of a people who dreaded\r\n      death much less than such an idolatrous profanation. 8 Their\r\n      attachment to the law of Moses was equal to their detestation of\r\n      foreign religions. The current of zeal and devotion, as it was\r\n      contracted into a narrow channel, ran with the strength, and\r\n      sometimes with the fury, of a torrent. This facility has not\r\n      always prevented intolerance, which seems inherent in the\r\n      religious spirit, when armed with authority. The separation of\r\n      the ecclesiastical and civil power, appears to be the only means\r\n      of at once maintaining religion and tolerance: but this is a very\r\n      modern notion. The passions, which mingle themselves with\r\n      opinions, made the Pagans very often intolerant and persecutors;\r\n      witness the Persians, the Egyptians even the Greeks and Romans.\r\n\r\n      1st. The Persians.—Cambyses, conqueror of the Egyptians,\r\n      condemned to death the magistrates of Memphis, because they had\r\n      offered divine honors to their god. Apis: he caused the god to be\r\n      brought before him, struck him with his dagger, commanded the\r\n      priests to be scourged, and ordered a general massacre of all the\r\n      Egyptians who should be found celebrating the festival of the\r\n      statues of the gods to be burnt. Not content with this\r\n      intolerance, he sent an army to reduce the Ammonians to slavery,\r\n      and to set on fire the temple in which Jupiter delivered his\r\n      oracles. See Herod. iii. 25—29, 37. Xerxes, during his invasion\r\n      of Greece, acted on the same principles: l c destroyed all the\r\n      temples of Greece and Ionia, except that of Ephesus. See Paus. l.\r\n      vii. p. 533, and x. p. 887.\r\n\r\n      Strabo, l. xiv. b. 941. 2d. The Egyptians.—They thought\r\n      themselves defiled when they had drunk from the same cup or eaten\r\n      at the same table with a man of a different belief from their\r\n      own. “He who has voluntarily killed any sacred animal is punished\r\n      with death; but if any one, even involuntarily, has killed a cat\r\n      or an ibis, he cannot escape the extreme penalty: the people drag\r\n      him away, treat him in the most cruel manner, sometimes without\r\n      waiting for a judicial sentence. * * * Even at the time when King\r\n      Ptolemy was not yet the acknowledged friend of the Roman people,\r\n      while the multitude were paying court with all possible attention\r\n      to the strangers who came from Italy * * a Roman having killed a\r\n      cat, the people rushed to his house, and neither the entreaties\r\n      of the nobles, whom the king sent to them, nor the terror of the\r\n      Roman name, were sufficiently powerful to rescue the man from\r\n      punishment, though he had committed the crime involuntarily.”\r\n      Diod. Sic. i 83. Juvenal, in his 13th Satire, describes the\r\n      sanguinary conflict between the inhabitants of Ombos and of\r\n      Tentyra, from religious animosity. The fury was carried so far,\r\n      that the conquerors tore and devoured the quivering limbs of the\r\n      conquered.\r\n\r\n      Ardet adhuc Ombos et Tentyra, summus utrinque Inde furor vulgo,\r\n      quod numina vicinorum Odit uterque locus; quum solos credat\r\n      habendos Esse Deos quos ipse colit. Sat. xv. v. 85.\r\n\r\n      3d. The Greeks.—“Let us not here,” says the Abbé Guénée, “refer\r\n      to the cities of Peloponnesus and their severity against atheism;\r\n      the Ephesians prosecuting Heraclitus for impiety; the Greeks\r\n      armed one against the other by religious zeal, in the\r\n      Amphictyonic war. Let us say nothing either of the frightful\r\n      cruelties inflicted by three successors of Alexander upon the\r\n      Jews, to force them to abandon their religion, nor of Antiochus\r\n      expelling the philosophers from his states. Let us not seek our\r\n      proofs of intolerance so far off. Athens, the polite and learned\r\n      Athens, will supply us with sufficient examples. Every citizen\r\n      made a public and solemn vow to conform to the religion of his\r\n      country, to defend it, and to cause it to be respected. An\r\n      express law severely punished all discourses against the gods,\r\n      and a rigid decree ordered the denunciation of all who should\r\n      deny their existence. * * * The practice was in unison with the\r\n      severity of the law. The proceedings commenced against\r\n      Protagoras; a price set upon the head of Diagoras; the danger of\r\n      Alcibiades; Aristotle obliged to fly; Stilpo banished; Anaxagoras\r\n      hardly escaping death; Pericles himself, after all his services\r\n      to his country, and all the glory he had acquired, compelled to\r\n      appear before the tribunals and make his defence; * * a priestess\r\n      executed for having introduced strange gods; Socrates condemned\r\n      and drinking the hemlock, because he was accused of not\r\n      recognizing those of his country, &c.; these facts attest too\r\n      loudly, to be called in question, the religious intolerance of\r\n      the most humane and enlightened people in Greece.” Lettres de\r\n      quelques Juifs a Mons. Voltaire, i. p. 221. (Compare Bentley on\r\n      Freethinking, from which much of this is derived.)—M.\r\n\r\n      4th. The Romans.—The laws of Rome were not less express and\r\n      severe. The intolerance of foreign religions reaches, with the\r\n      Romans, as high as the laws of the twelve tables; the\r\n      prohibitions were afterwards renewed at different times.\r\n      Intolerance did not discontinue under the emperors; witness the\r\n      counsel of Mæcenas to Augustus. This counsel is so remarkable,\r\n      that I think it right to insert it entire. “Honor the gods\r\n      yourself,” says Mæcenas to Augustus, “in every way according to\r\n      the usage of your ancestors, and compel others to worship them.\r\n      Hate and punish those who introduce strange gods, not only for\r\n      the sake of the gods, (he who despises them will respect no one,)\r\n      but because those who introduce new gods engage a multitude of\r\n      persons in foreign laws and customs. From hence arise unions\r\n      bound by oaths and confederacies, and associations, things\r\n      dangerous to a monarchy.” Dion Cass. l. ii. c. 36. (But, though\r\n      some may differ from it, see Gibbon’s just observation on this\r\n      passage in Dion Cassius, ch. xvi. note 117; impugned, indeed, by\r\n      M. Guizot, note in loc.)—M.\r\n\r\n      Even the laws which the philosophers of Athens and of Rome wrote\r\n      for their imaginary republics are intolerant. Plato does not\r\n      leave to his citizens freedom of religious worship; and Cicero\r\n      expressly prohibits them from having other gods than those of the\r\n      state. Lettres de quelques Juifs a Mons. Voltaire, i. p. 226.—G.\r\n\r\n      According to M. Guizot’s just remarks, religious intolerance will\r\n      always ally itself with the passions of man, however different\r\n      those passions may be. In the instances quoted above, with the\r\n      Persians it was the pride of despotism; to conquer the gods of a\r\n      country was the last mark of subjugation.

Note: Among a rude and\r\n      barbarous people, religious impressions are easily made, and are\r\n      as soon effaced. The ignorance which multiplies imaginary\r\n      wonders, would weaken and destroy the effect of real miracle. At\r\n      the period of the Jewish history, referred to in the passage from\r\n      Numbers, their fears predominated over their faith,—the fears of\r\n      an unwarlike people, just rescued from debasing slavery, and\r\n      commanded to attack a fierce, a well-armed, a gigantic, and a far\r\n      more numerous race, the inhabitants of Canaan. As to the frequent\r\n      apostasy of the Jews, their religion was beyond their state of\r\n      civilization. Nor is it uncommon for a people to cling with\r\n      passionate attachment to that of which, at first, they could not\r\n      appreciate the value. Patriotism and national pride will contend,\r\n      even to death, for political rights which have been forced upon a\r\n      reluctant people. The Christian may at least retort, with\r\n      justice, that the great sign of his religion, the resurrection of\r\n      Jesus, was most ardently believed, and most resolutely asserted,\r\n      by the eye witnesses of the fact.—M.]\r\n\r\n      The Jewish religion was admirably fitted for defence, but it was\r\n      never designed for conquest; and it seems probable that the\r\n      number of proselytes was never much superior to that of\r\n      apostates. The divine promises were originally made, and the\r\n      distinguishing rite of circumcision was enjoined, to a single\r\n      family. When the posterity of Abraham had multiplied like the\r\n      sands of the sea, the Deity, from whose mouth they received a\r\n      system of laws and ceremonies, declared himself the proper and as\r\n      it were the national God of Israel; and with the most jealous\r\n      care separated his favorite people from the rest of mankind. The\r\n      conquest of the land of Canaan was accompanied with so many\r\n      wonderful and with so many bloody circumstances, that the\r\n      victorious Jews were left in a state of irreconcilable hostility\r\n      with all their neighbors. They had been commanded to extirpate\r\n      some of the most idolatrous tribes, and the execution of the\r\n      divine will had seldom been retarded by the weakness of humanity.\r\n\r\n      With the other nations they were forbidden to contract any\r\n      marriages or alliances; and the prohibition of receiving them\r\n      into the congregation, which in some cases was perpetual, almost\r\n      always extended to the third, to the seventh, or even to the\r\n      tenth generation. The obligation of preaching to the Gentiles the\r\n      faith of Moses had never been inculcated as a precept of the law,\r\n      nor were the Jews inclined to impose it on themselves as a\r\n      voluntary duty.\r\n\r\n      In the admission of new citizens that unsocial people was\r\n      actuated by the selfish vanity of the Greeks, rather than by the\r\n      generous policy of Rome. The descendants of Abraham were\r\n      flattered by the opinion that they alone were the heirs of the\r\n      covenant, and they were apprehensive of diminishing the value of\r\n      their inheritance by sharing it too easily with the strangers of\r\n      the earth. A larger acquaintance with mankind extended their\r\n      knowledge without correcting their prejudices; and whenever the\r\n      God of Israel acquired any new votaries, he was much more\r\n      indebted to the inconstant humor of polytheism than to the active\r\n      zeal of his own missionaries. 11 The religion of Moses seems to\r\n      be instituted for a particular country as well as for a single\r\n      nation; and if a strict obedience had been paid to the order,\r\n      that every male, three times in the year, should present himself\r\n      before the Lord Jehovah, it would have been impossible that the\r\n      Jews could ever have spread themselves beyond the narrow limits\r\n      of the promised land. 12 That obstacle was indeed removed by the\r\n      destruction of the temple of Jerusalem; but the most considerable\r\n      part of the Jewish religion was involved in its destruction; and\r\n      the Pagans, who had long wondered at the strange report of an\r\n      empty sanctuary, 13 were at a loss to discover what could be the\r\n      object, or what could be the instruments, of a worship which was\r\n      destitute of temples and of altars, of priests and of sacrifices.\r\n\r\n      Yet even in their fallen state, the Jews, still asserting their\r\n      lofty and exclusive privileges, shunned, instead of courting, the\r\n      society of strangers. They still insisted with inflexible rigor\r\n      on those parts of the law which it was in their power to\r\n      practise. Their peculiar distinctions of days, of meats, and a\r\n      variety of trivial though burdensome observances, were so many\r\n      objects of disgust and aversion for the other nations, to whose\r\n      habits and prejudices they were diametrically opposite. The\r\n      painful and even dangerous rite of circumcision was alone capable\r\n      of repelling a willing proselyte from the door of the synagogue.\r\n      14\r\n\r\n      11 (return) [ All that relates to the Jewish proselytes has been\r\n      very ably by Basnage, Hist. des Juifs, l. vi. c. 6, 7.]\r\n\r\n      12 (return) [ See Exod. xxiv. 23, Deut. xvi. 16, the\r\n      commentators, and a very sensible note in the Universal History,\r\n      vol. i. p. 603, edit. fol.]\r\n\r\n      13 (return) [ When Pompey, using or abusing the right of\r\n      conquest, entered into the Holy of Holies, it was observed with\r\n      amazement, “Nulli intus Deum effigie, vacuam sedem et inania\r\n      arcana.” Tacit.

An exclusive zeal for the truth\r\n      of religion, and the unity of God, was as carefully inculcated in\r\n      the new as in the ancient system; and whatever was now revealed\r\n      to mankind concerning the nature and designs of the Supreme Being\r\n      was fitted to increase their reverence for that mysterious\r\n      doctrine. The divine authority of Moses and the prophets was\r\n      admitted, and even established, as the firmest basis of\r\n      Christianity. From the beginning of the world, an uninterrupted\r\n      series of predictions had announced and prepared the\r\n      long-expected coming of the Messiah, who, in compliance with the\r\n      gross apprehensions of the Jews, had been more frequently\r\n      represented under the character of a King and Conqueror, than\r\n      under that of a Prophet, a Martyr, and the Son of God. By his\r\n      expiatory sacrifice, the imperfect sacrifices of the temple were\r\n      at once consummated and abolished. The ceremonial law, which\r\n      consisted only of types and figures, was succeeded by a pure and\r\n      spiritual worship equally adapted to all climates, as well as to\r\n      every condition of mankind; and to the initiation of blood was\r\n      substituted a more harmless initiation of water. The promise of\r\n      divine favor, instead of being partially confined to the\r\n      posterity of Abraham, was universally proposed to the freeman and\r\n      the slave, to the Greek and to the barbarian, to the Jew and to\r\n      the Gentile. Every privilege that could raise the proselyte from\r\n      earth to heaven, that could exalt his devotion, secure his\r\n      happiness, or even gratify that secret pride which, under the\r\n      semblance of devotion, insinuates itself into the human heart,\r\n      was still reserved for the members of the Christian church; but\r\n      at the same time all mankind was permitted, and even solicited,\r\n      to accept the glorious distinction, which was not only proffered\r\n      as a favor, but imposed as an obligation. It became the most\r\n      sacred duty of a new convert to diffuse among his friends and\r\n      relations the inestimable blessing which he had received, and to\r\n      warn them against a refusal that would be severely punished as a\r\n      criminal disobedience to the will of a benevolent but\r\n      all-powerful Deity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter XV: Progress Of The Christian Religion.—Part II.\r\n\r\n      The enfranchisement of the church from the bonds of the synagogue\r\n      was a work, however, of some time and of some difficulty. The\r\n      Jewish converts, who acknowledged Jesus in the character of the\r\n      Messiah foretold by their ancient oracles, respected him as a\r\n      prophetic teacher of virtue and religion; but they obstinately\r\n      adhered to the ceremonies of their ancestors, and were desirous\r\n      of imposing them on the Gentiles, who continually augmented the\r\n      number of believers. These Judaizing Christians seem to have\r\n      argued with some degree of plausibility from the divine origin of\r\n      the Mosaic law, and from the immutable perfections of its great\r\n      Author. They affirmed, that if the Being, who is the same through\r\n      all eternity, had designed to abolish those sacred rites which\r\n      had served to distinguish his chosen people, the repeal of them\r\n      would have been no less clear and solemn than their first\r\n      promulgation: _that_, instead of those frequent declarations,\r\n      which either suppose or assert the perpetuity of the Mosaic\r\n      religion, it would have been represented as a provisionary scheme\r\n      intended to last only to the coming of the Messiah, who should\r\n      instruct mankind in a more perfect mode of faith and of worship:\r\n      15 _that_ the Messiah himself, and his disciples who conversed\r\n      with him on earth, instead of authorizing by their example the\r\n      most minute observances of the Mosaic law, 16 would have\r\n      published to the world the abolition of those useless and\r\n      obsolete ceremonies, without suffering Christianity to remain\r\n      during so many years obscurely confounded among the sects of the\r\n      Jewish church. Arguments like these appear to have been used in\r\n      the defence of the expiring cause of the Mosaic law; but the\r\n      industry of our learned divines has abundantly explained the\r\n      ambiguous language of the Old Testament, and the ambiguous\r\n      conduct of the apostolic teachers. It was proper gradually to\r\n      unfold the system of the gospel, and to pronounce, with the\r\n      utmost caution and tenderness, a sentence of condemnation so\r\n      repugnant to the inclination and prejudices of the believing\r\n      Jews.\r\n\r\n      15 (return) [ These arguments were urged with great ingenuity by\r\n      the Jew Orobio, and refuted with equal ingenuity and candor by\r\n      the Christian Limborch.

A little afterwards,\r\n      (c. 12,) he expatiates on the condescension of the apostles.]\r\n\r\n      The history of the church of Jerusalem affords a lively proof of\r\n      the necessity of those precautions, and of the deep impression\r\n      which the Jewish religion had made on the minds of its sectaries.\r\n      The first fifteen bishops of Jerusalem were all circumcised Jews;\r\n      and the congregation over which they presided united the law of\r\n      Moses with the doctrine of Christ. 17 It was natural that the\r\n      primitive tradition of a church which was founded only forty days\r\n      after the death of Christ, and was governed almost as many years\r\n      under the immediate inspection of his apostle, should be received\r\n      as the standard of orthodoxy. The distant churches very\r\n      frequently appealed to the authority of their venerable Parent,\r\n      and relieved her distresses by a liberal contribution of alms.\r\n      But when numerous and opulent societies were established in the\r\n      great cities of the empire, in Antioch, Alexandria, Ephesus,\r\n      Corinth, and Rome, the reverence which Jerusalem had inspired to\r\n      all the Christian colonies insensibly diminished. 18b The Jewish\r\n      converts, or, as they were afterwards called, the Nazarenes, who\r\n      had laid the foundations of the church, soon found themselves\r\n      overwhelmed by the increasing multitudes, that from all the\r\n      various religions of polytheism enlisted under the banner of\r\n      Christ: and the Gentiles, who, with the approbation of their\r\n      peculiar apostle, had rejected the intolerable weight of the\r\n      Mosaic ceremonies, at length refused to their more scrupulous\r\n      brethren the same toleration which at first they had humbly\r\n      solicited for their own practice. The ruin of the temple of the\r\n      city, and of the public religion of the Jews, was severely felt\r\n      by the Nazarenes; as in their manners, though not in their faith,\r\n      they maintained so intimate a connection with their impious\r\n      countrymen, whose misfortunes were attributed by the Pagans to\r\n      the contempt, and more justly ascribed by the Christians to the\r\n      wrath, of the Supreme Deity. The Nazarenes retired from the ruins\r\n      of Jerusalem 18 to the little town of Pella beyond the Jordan,\r\n      where that ancient church languished above sixty years in\r\n      solitude and obscurity. 19 They still enjoyed the comfort of\r\n      making frequent and devout visits to the _Holy City_, and the\r\n      hope of being one day restored to those seats which both nature\r\n      and religion taught them to love as well as to revere. But at\r\n      length, under the reign of Hadrian, the desperate fanaticism of\r\n      the Jews filled up the measure of their calamities; and the\r\n      Romans, exasperated by their repeated rebellions, exercised the\r\n      rights of victory with unusual rigor. The emperor founded, under\r\n      the name of Ælia Capitolina, a new city on Mount Sion, 20 to\r\n      which he gave the privileges of a colony; and denouncing the\r\n      severest penalties against any of the Jewish people who should\r\n      dare to approach its precincts, he fixed a vigilant garrison of a\r\n      Roman cohort to enforce the execution of his orders. The\r\n      Nazarenes had only one way left to escape the common\r\n      proscription, and the force of truth was on this occasion\r\n      assisted by the influence of temporal advantages. They elected\r\n      Marcus for their bishop, a prelate of the race of the Gentiles,\r\n      and most probably a native either of Italy or of some of the\r\n      Latin provinces. At his persuasion, the most considerable part of\r\n      the congregation renounced the Mosaic law, in the practice of\r\n      which they had persevered above a century. By this sacrifice of\r\n      their habits and prejudices, they purchased a free admission into\r\n      the colony of Hadrian, and more firmly cemented their union with\r\n      the Catholic church. 21\r\n\r\n      17 (return) [ Pæne omnes Christum Deum sub legis observatione\r\n      credebant Sulpicius Severus, ii. 31.

They still preserved their former\r\n      habitation of Pella, spread themselves into the villages adjacent\r\n      to Damascus, and formed an inconsiderable church in the city of\r\n      Berœa, or, as it is now called, of Aleppo, in Syria. 22 The name\r\n      of Nazarenes was deemed too honorable for those Christian Jews,\r\n      and they soon received, from the supposed poverty of their\r\n      understanding, as well as of their condition, the contemptuous\r\n      epithet of Ebionites. 23 In a few years after the return of the\r\n      church of Jerusalem, it became a matter of doubt and controversy,\r\n      whether a man who sincerely acknowledged Jesus as the Messiah,\r\n      but who still continued to observe the law of Moses, could\r\n      possibly hope for salvation. The humane temper of Justin Martyr\r\n      inclined him to answer this question in the affirmative; and\r\n      though he expressed himself with the most guarded diffidence, he\r\n      ventured to determine in favor of such an imperfect Christian, if\r\n      he were content to practise the Mosaic ceremonies, without\r\n      pretending to assert their general use or necessity. But when\r\n      Justin was pressed to declare the sentiment of the church, he\r\n      confessed that there were very many among the orthodox\r\n      Christians, who not only excluded their Judaizing brethren from\r\n      the hope of salvation, but who declined any intercourse with them\r\n      in the common offices of friendship, hospitality, and social\r\n      life. 24 The more rigorous opinion prevailed, as it was natural\r\n      to expect, over the milder; and an eternal bar of separation was\r\n      fixed between the disciples of Moses and those of Christ. The\r\n      unfortunate Ebionites, rejected from one religion as apostates,\r\n      and from the other as heretics, found themselves compelled to\r\n      assume a more decided character; and although some traces of that\r\n      obsolete sect may be discovered as late as the fourth century,\r\n      they insensibly melted away, either into the church or the\r\n      synagogue. 25\r\n\r\n      22 (return) [ Le Clerc (Hist.

From the acknowledged truth of the Jewish\r\n      religion, the Ebionites had concluded that it could never be\r\n      abolished. From its supposed imperfections, the Gnostics as\r\n      hastily inferred that it never was instituted by the wisdom of\r\n      the Deity. There are some objections against the authority of\r\n      Moses and the prophets, which too readily present themselves to\r\n      the sceptical mind; though they can only be derived from our\r\n      ignorance of remote antiquity, and from our incapacity to form an\r\n      adequate judgment of the divine economy. These objections were\r\n      eagerly embraced and as petulantly urged by the vain science of\r\n      the Gnostics. 26 As those heretics were, for the most part,\r\n      averse to the pleasures of sense, they morosely arraigned the\r\n      polygamy of the patriarchs, the gallantries of David, and the\r\n      seraglio of Solomon. The conquest of the land of Canaan, and the\r\n      extirpation of the unsuspecting natives, they were at a loss how\r\n      to reconcile with the common notions of humanity and justice. 261\r\n      But when they recollected the sanguinary list of murders, of\r\n      executions, and of massacres, which stain almost every page of\r\n      the Jewish annals, they acknowledged that the barbarians of\r\n      Palestine had exercised as much compassion towards their\r\n      idolatrous enemies, as they had ever shown to their friends or\r\n      countrymen. 27 Passing from the sectaries of the law to the law\r\n      itself, they asserted that it was impossible that a religion\r\n      which consisted only of bloody sacrifices and trifling\r\n      ceremonies, and whose rewards as well as punishments were all of\r\n      a carnal and temporal nature, could inspire the love of virtue,\r\n      or restrain the impetuosity of passion. The Mosaic account of the\r\n      creation and fall of man was treated with profane derision by the\r\n      Gnostics, who would not listen with patience to the repose of the\r\n      Deity after six days’ labor, to the rib of Adam, the garden of\r\n      Eden, the trees of life and of knowledge, the speaking serpent,\r\n      the forbidden fruit, and the condemnation pronounced against\r\n      human kind for the venial offence of their first progenitors. 28\r\n      The God of Israel was impiously represented by the Gnostics as a\r\n      being liable to passion and to error, capricious in his favor,\r\n      implacable in his resentment, meanly jealous of his superstitious\r\n      worship, and confining his partial providence to a single people,\r\n      and to this transitory life. In such a character they could\r\n      discover none of the features of the wise and omnipotent Father\r\n      of the universe. 29 They allowed that the religion of the Jews\r\n      was somewhat less criminal than the idolatry of the Gentiles; but\r\n      it was their fundamental doctrine that the Christ whom they\r\n      adored as the first and brightest emanation of the Deity appeared\r\n      upon earth to rescue mankind from their various errors, and to\r\n      reveal a new system of truth and perfection.

As the terms of\r\n      communion were insensibly narrowed, and the spiritual authority\r\n      of the prevailing party was exercised with increasing severity,\r\n      many of its most respectable adherents, who were called upon to\r\n      renounce, were provoked to assert their private opinions, to\r\n      pursue the consequences of their mistaken principles, and openly\r\n      to erect the standard of rebellion against the unity of the\r\n      church. The Gnostics were distinguished as the most polite, the\r\n      most learned, and the most wealthy of the Christian name; and\r\n      that general appellation, which expressed a superiority of\r\n      knowledge, was either assumed by their own pride, or ironically\r\n      bestowed by the envy of their adversaries. They were almost\r\n      without exception of the race of the Gentiles, and their\r\n      principal founders seem to have been natives of Syria or Egypt,\r\n      where the warmth of the climate disposes both the mind and the\r\n      body to indolent and contemplative devotion. The Gnostics blended\r\n      with the faith of Christ many sublime but obscure tenets, which\r\n      they derived from oriental philosophy, and even from the religion\r\n      of Zoroaster, concerning the eternity of matter, the existence of\r\n      two principles, and the mysterious hierarchy of the invisible\r\n      world. 32 As soon as they launched out into that vast abyss, they\r\n      delivered themselves to the guidance of a disordered imagination;\r\n      and as the paths of error are various and infinite, the Gnostics\r\n      were imperceptibly divided into more than fifty particular sects,\r\n      33 of whom the most celebrated appear to have been the\r\n      Basilidians, the Valentinians, the Marcionites, and, in a still\r\n      later period, the Manichæans. Each of these sects could boast of\r\n      its bishops and congregations, of its doctors and martyrs; 34\r\n      and, instead of the Four Gospels adopted by the church, 341 the\r\n      heretics produced a multitude of histories, in which the actions\r\n      and discourses of Christ and of his apostles were adapted to\r\n      their respective tenets. 35 The success of the Gnostics was rapid\r\n      and extensive. 36 They covered Asia and Egypt, established\r\n      themselves in Rome, and sometimes penetrated into the provinces\r\n      of the West. For the most part they arose in the second century,\r\n      flourished during the third, and were suppressed in the fourth or\r\n      fifth, by the prevalence of more fashionable controversies, and\r\n      by the superior ascendant of the reigning power. Though they\r\n      constantly disturbed the peace, and frequently disgraced the\r\n      name, of religion, they contributed to assist rather than to\r\n      retard the progress of Christianity.

The philosopher, who\r\n      considered the system of polytheism as a composition of human\r\n      fraud and error, could disguise a smile of contempt under the\r\n      mask of devotion, without apprehending that either the mockery,\r\n      or the compliance, would expose him to the resentment of any\r\n      invisible, or, as he conceived them, imaginary powers. But the\r\n      established religions of Paganism were seen by the primitive\r\n      Christians in a much more odious and formidable light. It was the\r\n      universal sentiment both of the church and of heretics, that the\r\n      dæmons were the authors, the patrons, and the objects of\r\n      idolatry. 38 Those rebellious spirits who had been degraded from\r\n      the rank of angels, and cast down into the infernal pit, were\r\n      still permitted to roam upon earth, to torment the bodies, and to\r\n      seduce the minds, of sinful men. The dæmons soon discovered and\r\n      abused the natural propensity of the human heart towards\r\n      devotion, and artfully withdrawing the adoration of mankind from\r\n      their Creator, they usurped the place and honors of the Supreme\r\n      Deity. By the success of their malicious contrivances, they at\r\n      once gratified their own vanity and revenge, and obtained the\r\n      only comfort of which they were yet susceptible, the hope of\r\n      involving the human species in the participation of their guilt\r\n      and misery. It was confessed, or at least it was imagined, that\r\n      they had distributed among themselves the most important\r\n      characters of polytheism, one dæmon assuming the name and\r\n      attributes of Jupiter, another of Æsculapius, a third of Venus,\r\n      and a fourth perhaps of Apollo; 39 and that, by the advantage of\r\n      their long experience and ærial nature, they were enabled to\r\n      execute, with sufficient skill and dignity, the parts which they\r\n      had undertaken. They lurked in the temples, instituted festivals\r\n      and sacrifices, invented fables, pronounced oracles, and were\r\n      frequently allowed to perform miracles.

The innumerable deities and rites of polytheism were\r\n      closely interwoven with every circumstance of business or\r\n      pleasure, of public or of private life, and it seemed impossible\r\n      to escape the observance of them, without, at the same time,\r\n      renouncing the commerce of mankind, and all the offices and\r\n      amusements of society. 40 The important transactions of peace and\r\n      war were prepared or concluded by solemn sacrifices, in which the\r\n      magistrate, the senator, and the soldier, were obliged to preside\r\n      or to participate. 41 The public spectacles were an essential\r\n      part of the cheerful devotion of the Pagans, and the gods were\r\n      supposed to accept, as the most grateful offering, the games that\r\n      the prince and people celebrated in honor of their peculiar\r\n      festivals. 42 The Christians, who with pious horror avoided the\r\n      abomination of the circus or the theatre, found himself\r\n      encompassed with infernal snares in every convivial\r\n      entertainment, as often as his friends, invoking the hospitable\r\n      deities, poured out libations to each other’s happiness. 43 When\r\n      the bride, struggling with well-affected reluctance, was forced\r\n      in hymenæal pomp over the threshold of her new habitation, 44 or\r\n      when the sad procession of the dead slowly moved towards the\r\n      funeral pile, 45 the Christian, on these interesting occasions,\r\n      was compelled to desert the persons who were the dearest to him,\r\n      rather than contract the guilt inherent to those impious\r\n      ceremonies. Every art and every trade that was in the least\r\n      concerned in the framing or adorning of idols was polluted by the\r\n      stain of idolatry; 46 a severe sentence, since it devoted to\r\n      eternal misery the far greater part of the community, which is\r\n      employed in the exercise of liberal or mechanic professions. If\r\n      we cast our eyes over the numerous remains of antiquity, we shall\r\n      perceive, that besides the immediate representations of the gods,\r\n      and the holy instruments of their worship, the elegant forms and\r\n      agreeable fictions consecrated by the imagination of the Greeks,\r\n      were introduced as the richest ornaments of the houses, the\r\n      dress, and the furniture of the Pagans. 47 Even the arts of music\r\n      and painting, of eloquence and poetry, flowed from the same\r\n      impure origin. In the style of the fathers, Apollo and the Muses\r\n      were the organs of the infernal spirit; Homer and Virgil were the\r\n      most eminent of his servants; and the beautiful mythology which\r\n      pervades and animates the compositions of their genius, is\r\n      destined to celebrate the glory of the dæmons. Even the common\r\n      language of Greece and Rome abounded with familiar but impious\r\n      expressions, which the imprudent Christian might too carelessly\r\n      utter, or too patiently hear. 48\r\n\r\n      40 (return) [ Tertullian has written a most severe treatise\r\n      against idolatry, to caution his brethren against the hourly\r\n      danger of incurring that guilt.

So artfully were they\r\n      framed and disposed throughout the year, that superstition always\r\n      wore the appearance of pleasure, and often of virtue. Some of the\r\n      most sacred festivals in the Roman ritual were destined to salute\r\n      the new calends of January with vows of public and private\r\n      felicity; to indulge the pious remembrance of the dead and\r\n      living; to ascertain the inviolable bounds of property; to hail,\r\n      on the return of spring, the genial powers of fecundity; to\r\n      perpetuate the two memorable æras of Rome, the foundation of the\r\n      city and that of the republic; and to restore, during the humane\r\n      license of the Saturnalia, the primitive equality of mankind.\r\n      Some idea may be conceived of the abhorrence of the Christians\r\n      for such impious ceremonies, by the scrupulous delicacy which\r\n      they displayed on a much less alarming occasion. On days of\r\n      general festivity it was the custom of the ancients to adorn\r\n      their doors with lamps and with branches of laurel, and to crown\r\n      their heads with a garland of flowers. This innocent and elegant\r\n      practice might perhaps have been tolerated as a mere civil\r\n      institution. But it most unluckily happened that the doors were\r\n      under the protection of the household gods, that the laurel was\r\n      sacred to the lover of Daphne, and that garlands of flowers,\r\n      though frequently worn as a symbol either of joy or mourning, had\r\n      been dedicated in their first origin to the service of\r\n      superstition. The trembling Christians, who were persuaded in\r\n      this instance to comply with the fashion of their country, and\r\n      the commands of the magistrate, labored under the most gloomy\r\n      apprehensions, from the reproaches of his own conscience, the\r\n      censures of the church, and the denunciations of divine\r\n      vengeance. 49 50\r\n\r\n      49 (return) [ Consult the most labored work of Ovid, his\r\n      imperfect Fasti.

By the mention of the\r\n      emperors, (Severus and Caracalla,) it is evident, notwithstanding\r\n      the wishes of M. de Tillemont, that Tertullian composed his\r\n      treatise De Corona long before he was engaged in the errors of\r\n      the Montanists.

But as often as they occurred, they\r\n      afforded the Christians an opportunity of declaring and\r\n      confirming their zealous opposition. By these frequent\r\n      protestations their attachment to the faith was continually\r\n      fortified; and in proportion to the increase of zeal, they\r\n      combated with the more ardor and success in the holy war, which\r\n      they had undertaken against the empire of the demons.\r\n\r\n      II. The writings of Cicero 51 represent in the most lively colors\r\n      the ignorance, the errors, and the uncertainty of the ancient\r\n      philosophers with regard to the immortality of the soul. When\r\n      they are desirous of arming their disciples against the fear of\r\n      death, they inculcate, as an obvious though melancholy position,\r\n      that the fatal stroke of our dissolution releases us from the\r\n      calamities of life; and that those can no longer suffer, who no\r\n      longer exist. Yet there were a few sages of Greece and Rome who\r\n      had conceived a more exalted, and, in some respects, a juster\r\n      idea of human nature, though it must be confessed, that in the\r\n      sublime inquiry, their reason had been often guided by their\r\n      imagination, and that their imagination had been prompted by\r\n      their vanity. When they viewed with complacency the extent of\r\n      their own mental powers, when they exercised the various\r\n      faculties of memory, of fancy, and of judgment, in the most\r\n      profound speculations, or the most important labors, and when\r\n      they reflected on the desire of fame, which transported them into\r\n      future ages, far beyond the bounds of death and of the grave,\r\n      they were unwilling to confound themselves with the beasts of the\r\n      field, or to suppose that a being, for whose dignity they\r\n      entertained the most sincere admiration, could be limited to a\r\n      spot of earth, and to a few years of duration. With this\r\n      favorable prepossession they summoned to their aid the science,\r\n      or rather the language, of Metaphysics. They soon discovered,\r\n      that as none of the properties of matter will apply to the\r\n      operations of the mind, the human soul must consequently be a\r\n      substance distinct from the body, pure, simple, and spiritual,\r\n      incapable of dissolution, and susceptible of a much higher degree\r\n      of virtue and happiness after the release from its corporeal\r\n      prison. From these specious and noble principles, the\r\n      philosophers who trod in the footsteps of Plato deduced a very\r\n      unjustifiable conclusion, since they asserted, not only the\r\n      future immortality, but the past eternity, of the human soul,\r\n      which they were too apt to consider as a portion of the infinite\r\n      and self-existing spirit, which pervades and sustains the\r\n      universe. 52 A doctrine thus removed beyond the senses and the\r\n      experience of mankind might serve to amuse the leisure of a\r\n      philosophic mind; or, in the silence of solitude, it might\r\n      sometimes impart a ray of comfort to desponding virtue; but the\r\n      faint impression which had been received in the schools was soon\r\n      obliterated by the commerce and business of active life. We are\r\n      sufficiently acquainted with the eminent persons who flourished\r\n      in the age of Cicero and of the first Cæsars, with their actions,\r\n      their characters, and their motives, to be assured that their\r\n      conduct in this life was never regulated by any serious\r\n      conviction of the rewards or punishments of a future state. At\r\n      the bar and in the senate of Rome the ablest orators were not\r\n      apprehensive of giving offence to their hearers by exposing that\r\n      doctrine as an idle and extravagant opinion, which was rejected\r\n      with contempt by every man of a liberal education and\r\n      understanding. 53\r\n\r\n      51 (return) [ In particular, the first book of the Tusculan\r\n      Questions, and the treatise De Senectute, and the Somnium\r\n      Scipionis, contain, in the most beautiful language, every thing\r\n      that Grecian philosophy, on Roman good sense, could possibly\r\n      suggest on this dark but important object.]\r\n\r\n      52 (return) [ The preexistence of human souls, so far at least as\r\n      that doctrine is compatible with religion, was adopted by many of\r\n      the Greek and Latin fathers.

But we may perceive several defects inherent to the\r\n      popular religions of Greece and Rome, which rendered them very\r\n      unequal to so arduous a task. 1. The general system of their\r\n      mythology was unsupported by any solid proofs; and the wisest\r\n      among the Pagans had already disclaimed its usurped authority. 2.\r\n      The description of the infernal regions had been abandoned to the\r\n      fancy of painters and of poets, who peopled them with so many\r\n      phantoms and monsters, who dispensed their rewards and\r\n      punishments with so little equity, that a solemn truth, the most\r\n      congenial to the human heart, was oppressed and disgraced by the\r\n      absurd mixture of the wildest fictions. 54 3. The doctrine of a\r\n      future state was scarcely considered among the devout polytheists\r\n      of Greece and Rome as a fundamental article of faith. The\r\n      providence of the gods, as it related to public communities\r\n      rather than to private individuals, was principally displayed on\r\n      the visible theatre of the present world. The petitions which\r\n      were offered on the altars of Jupiter or Apollo expressed the\r\n      anxiety of their worshippers for temporal happiness, and their\r\n      ignorance or indifference concerning a future life. 55 The\r\n      important truth of the immortality of the soul was inculcated\r\n      with more diligence, as well as success, in India, in Assyria, in\r\n      Egypt, and in Gaul; and since we cannot attribute such a\r\n      difference to the superior knowledge of the barbarians, we must\r\n      ascribe it to the influence of an established priesthood, which\r\n      employed the motives of virtue as the instrument of ambition. 56\r\n\r\n      54 (return) [ The xith book of the Odyssey gives a very dreary\r\n      and incoherent account of the infernal shades.

The same custom is more darkly\r\n      insinuated by Mela, l. iii. c. 2. It is almost needless to add,\r\n      that the profits of trade hold a just proportion to the credit of\r\n      the merchant, and that the Druids derived from their holy\r\n      profession a character of responsibility, which could scarcely be\r\n      claimed by any other order of men.]\r\n\r\n      We might naturally expect that a principle so essential to\r\n      religion, would have been revealed in the clearest terms to the\r\n      chosen people of Palestine, and that it might safely have been\r\n      intrusted to the hereditary priesthood of Aaron. It is incumbent\r\n      on us to adore the mysterious dispensations of Providence, 57\r\n      when we discover that the doctrine of the immortality of the soul\r\n      is omitted in the law of Moses; it is darkly insinuated by the\r\n      prophets; and during the long period which elapsed between the\r\n      Egyptian and the Babylonian servitudes, the hopes as well as\r\n      fears of the Jews appear to have been confined within the narrow\r\n      compass of the present life. 58 After Cyrus had permitted the\r\n      exiled nation to return into the promised land, and after Ezra\r\n      had restored the ancient records of their religion, two\r\n      celebrated sects, the Sadducees and the Pharisees, insensibly\r\n      arose at Jerusalem. 59 The former, selected from the more opulent\r\n      and distinguished ranks of society, were strictly attached to the\r\n      literal sense of the Mosaic law, and they piously rejected the\r\n      immortality of the soul, as an opinion that received no\r\n      countenance from the divine book, which they revered as the only\r\n      rule of their faith. To the authority of Scripture the Pharisees\r\n      added that of tradition, and they accepted, under the name of\r\n      traditions, several speculative tenets from the philosophy or\r\n      religion of the eastern nations. The doctrines of fate or\r\n      predestination, of angels and spirits, and of a future state of\r\n      rewards and punishments, were in the number of these new articles\r\n      of belief; and as the Pharisees, by the austerity of their\r\n      manners, had drawn into their party the body of the Jewish\r\n      people, the immortality of the soul became the prevailing\r\n      sentiment of the synagogue, under the reign of the Asmonæan\r\n      princes and pontiffs. The temper of the Jews was incapable of\r\n      contenting itself with such a cold and languid assent as might\r\n      satisfy the mind of a Polytheist; and as soon as they admitted\r\n      the idea of a future state, they embraced it with the zeal which\r\n      has always formed the characteristic of the nation. Their zeal,\r\n      however, added nothing to its evidence, or even probability: and\r\n      it was still necessary that the doctrine of life and immortality,\r\n      which had been dictated by nature, approved by reason, and\r\n      received by superstition, should obtain the sanction of divine\r\n      truth from the authority and example of Christ.\r\n\r\n      57 (return) [ The right reverend author of the Divine Legation of\r\n      Moses as signs a very curious reason for the omission, and most\r\n      ingeniously retorts it on the unbelievers. * Note: The hypothesis\r\n      of Warburton concerning this remarkable fact, which, as far as\r\n      the Law of Moses, is unquestionable, made few disciples; and it\r\n      is difficult to suppose that it could be intended by the author\r\n      himself for more than a display of intellectual strength. Modern\r\n      writers have accounted in various ways for the silence of the\r\n      Hebrew legislator on the immortality of the soul. According to\r\n      Michaelis, “Moses wrote as an historian and as a lawgiver; he\r\n      regulated the ecclesiastical discipline, rather than the\r\n      religious belief of his people; and the sanctions of the law\r\n      being temporal, he had no occasion, and as a civil legislator\r\n      could not with propriety, threaten punishments in another world.”\r\n      See Michaelis, Laws of Moses, art. 272, vol. iv. p. 209, Eng.\r\n      Trans.; and Syntagma Commentationum, p. 80, quoted by Guizot. M.\r\n      Guizot adds, the “ingenious conjecture of a philosophic\r\n      theologian,” which approximates to an opinion long entertained by\r\n      the Editor. That writer believes, that in the state of\r\n      civilization at the time of the legislator, this doctrine, become\r\n      popular among the Jews, would necessarily have given birth to a\r\n      multitude of idolatrous superstitions which he wished to prevent.\r\n      His primary object was to establish a firm theocracy, to make his\r\n      people the conservators of the doctrine of the Divine Unity, the\r\n      basis upon which Christianity was hereafter to rest. He carefully\r\n      excluded everything which could obscure or weaken that doctrine.\r\n      Other nations had strangely abused their notions on the\r\n      immortality of the soul; Moses wished to prevent this abuse:\r\n      hence he forbade the Jews from consulting necromancers, (those\r\n      who evoke the spirits of the dead.)

Those who\r\n      reflect on the state of the Pagans and the Jews, and on the\r\n      facility with which idolatry crept in on every side, will not be\r\n      astonished that Moses has not developed a doctrine of which the\r\n      influence might be more pernicious than useful to his people.\r\n      Orat.

But this doctrine if popularly known\r\n      among the Jews, must have been purely Egyptian, and as so,\r\n      intimately connected with the whole religious system of that\r\n      country. It was no doubt moulded up with the tenet of the\r\n      transmigration of the soul, perhaps with notions analogous to the\r\n      emanation system of India in which the human soul was an efflux\r\n      from or indeed a part of, the Deity. The Mosaic religion drew a\r\n      wide and impassable interval between the Creator and created\r\n      human beings: in this it differed from the Egyptian and all the\r\n      Eastern religions. As then the immortality of the soul was thus\r\n      inseparably blended with those foreign religions which were\r\n      altogether to be effaced from the minds of the people, and by no\r\n      means necessary for the establishment of the theocracy, Moses\r\n      maintained silence on this point and a purer notion of it was\r\n      left to be developed at a more favorable period in the history of\r\n      man.—M.]\r\n\r\n      58 (return) [ See Le Clerc (Prolegomena ad Hist.

According to the most natural interpretation of his words,\r\n      the Sadducees admitted only the Pentateuch; but it has pleased\r\n      some modern critics to add the Prophets to their creed, and to\r\n      suppose that they contented themselves with rejecting the\r\n      traditions of the Pharisees. Dr. Jortin has argued that point in\r\n      his Remarks on Ecclesiastical History, vol. ii. p. 103.]\r\n\r\n      When the promise of eternal happiness was proposed to mankind on\r\n      condition of adopting the faith, and of observing the precepts,\r\n      of the gospel, it is no wonder that so advantageous an offer\r\n      should have been accepted by great numbers of every religion, of\r\n      every rank, and of every province in the Roman empire. The\r\n      ancient Christians were animated by a contempt for their present\r\n      existence, and by a just confidence of immortality, of which the\r\n      doubtful and imperfect faith of modern ages cannot give us any\r\n      adequate notion. In the primitive church, the influence of truth\r\n      was very powerfully strengthened by an opinion, which, however it\r\n      may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity, has not\r\n      been found agreeable to experience. It was universally believed,\r\n      that the end of the world, and the kingdom of heaven, were at\r\n      hand. 591 The near approach of this wonderful event had been\r\n      predicted by the apostles; the tradition of it was preserved by\r\n      their earliest disciples, and those who understood in their\r\n      literal senses the discourse of Christ himself, were obliged to\r\n      expect the second and glorious coming of the Son of Man in the\r\n      clouds, before that generation was totally extinguished, which\r\n      had beheld his humble condition upon earth, and which might still\r\n      be witness of the calamities of the Jews under Vespasian or\r\n      Hadrian. The revolution of seventeen centuries has instructed us\r\n      not to press too closely the mysterious language of prophecy and\r\n      revelation; but as long as, for wise purposes, this error was\r\n      permitted to subsist in the church, it was productive of the most\r\n      salutary effects on the faith and practice of Christians, who\r\n      lived in the awful expectation of that moment, when the globe\r\n      itself, and all the various race of mankind, should tremble at\r\n      the appearance of their divine Judge. 60\r\n\r\n      591 (return) [ This was, in fact, an integral part of the Jewish\r\n      notion of the Messiah, from which the minds of the apostles\r\n      themselves were but gradually detached.

They say, that Jesus Christ, after having proclaimed\r\n      the ruin of Jerusalem and of the Temple, speaks of his second\r\n      coming and the sings which were to precede it; but those who\r\n      believed that the moment was near deceived themselves as to the\r\n      sense of two words, an error which still subsists in our versions\r\n      of the Gospel according to St. Matthew, xxiv. 29, 34. In verse\r\n      29, we read, “Immediately after the tribulation of those days\r\n      shall the sun be darkened,” &c. The Greek word signifies all at\r\n      once, suddenly, not immediately; so that it signifies only the\r\n      sudden appearance of the signs which Jesus Christ announces not\r\n      the shortness of the interval which was to separate them from the\r\n      “days of tribulation,” of which he was speaking. The verse 34 is\r\n      this “Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass till\r\n      all these things shall be fulfilled.” Jesus, speaking to his\r\n      disciples, uses these words, which the translators have rendered\r\n      by this generation, but which means the race, the filiation of my\r\n      disciples; that is, he speaks of a class of men, not of a\r\n      generation. The true sense then, according to these learned men,\r\n      is, In truth I tell you that this race of men, of which you are\r\n      the commencement, shall not pass away till this shall take place;\r\n      that is to say, the succession of Christians shall not cease till\r\n      his coming.

As the works of the\r\n      creation had been finished in six days, their duration in their\r\n      present state, according to a tradition which was attributed to\r\n      the prophet Elijah, was fixed to six thousand years. 61 By the\r\n      same analogy it was inferred, that this long period of labor and\r\n      contention, which was now almost elapsed, 62 would be succeeded\r\n      by a joyful Sabbath of a thousand years; and that Christ, with\r\n      the triumphant band of the saints and the elect who had escaped\r\n      death, or who had been miraculously revived, would reign upon\r\n      earth till the time appointed for the last and general\r\n      resurrection. So pleasing was this hope to the mind of believers,\r\n      that the _New Jerusalem_, the seat of this blissful kingdom, was\r\n      quickly adorned with all the gayest colors of the imagination. A\r\n      felicity consisting only of pure and spiritual pleasure would\r\n      have appeared too refined for its inhabitants, who were still\r\n      supposed to possess their human nature and senses. A garden of\r\n      Eden, with the amusements of the pastoral life, was no longer\r\n      suited to the advanced state of society which prevailed under the\r\n      Roman empire. A city was therefore erected of gold and precious\r\n      stones, and a supernatural plenty of corn and wine was bestowed\r\n      on the adjacent territory; in the free enjoyment of whose\r\n      spontaneous productions the happy and benevolent people was never\r\n      to be restrained by any jealous laws of exclusive property. 63\r\n      The assurance of such a Millennium was carefully inculcated by a\r\n      succession of fathers from Justin Martyr, 64 and Irenæus, who\r\n      conversed with the immediate disciples of the apostles, down to\r\n      Lactantius, who was preceptor to the son of Constantine. 65\r\n      Though it might not be universally received, it appears to have\r\n      been the reigning sentiment of the orthodox believers; and it\r\n      seems so well adapted to the desires and apprehensions of\r\n      mankind, that it must have contributed in a very considerable\r\n      degree to the progress of the Christian faith. But when the\r\n      edifice of the church was almost completed, the temporary support\r\n      was laid aside. The doctrine of Christ’s reign upon earth was at\r\n      first treated as a profound allegory, was considered by degrees\r\n      as a doubtful and useless opinion, and was at length rejected as\r\n      the absurd invention of heresy and fanaticism. 66 A mysterious\r\n      prophecy, which still forms a part of the sacred canon, but which\r\n      was thought to favor the exploded sentiment, has very narrowly\r\n      escaped the proscription of the church. 67\r\n\r\n      61 (return) [ See Burnet’s Sacred Theory, part iii. c. 5.

The Greeks were subdued by\r\n      the authority of an impostor, who, in the sixth century, assumed\r\n      the character of Dionysius the Areopagite. 2.

The edification of a new\r\n      Jerusalem was to advance by equal steps with the destruction of\r\n      the mystic Babylon; and as long as the emperors who reigned\r\n      before Constantine persisted in the profession of idolatry, the\r\n      epithet of Babylon was applied to the city and to the empire of\r\n      Rome. A regular series was prepared of all the moral and physical\r\n      evils which can afflict a flourishing nation; intestine discord,\r\n      and the invasion of the fiercest barbarians from the unknown\r\n      regions of the North; pestilence and famine, comets and eclipses,\r\n      earthquakes and inundations. 68 All these were only so many\r\n      preparatory and alarming signs of the great catastrophe of Rome,\r\n      when the country of the Scipios and Cæsars should be consumed by\r\n      a flame from Heaven, and the city of the seven hills, with her\r\n      palaces, her temples, and her triumphal arches, should be buried\r\n      in a vast lake of fire and brimstone. It might, however, afford\r\n      some consolation to Roman vanity, that the period of their empire\r\n      would be that of the world itself; which, as it had once perished\r\n      by the element of water, was destined to experience a second and\r\n      a speedy destruction from the element of fire. In the opinion of\r\n      a general conflagration, the faith of the Christian very happily\r\n      coincided with the tradition of the East, the philosophy of the\r\n      Stoics, and the analogy of Nature; and even the country, which,\r\n      from religious motives, had been chosen for the origin and\r\n      principal scene of the conflagration, was the best adapted for\r\n      that purpose by natural and physical causes; by its deep caverns,\r\n      beds of sulphur, and numerous volcanoes, of which those of Ætna,\r\n      of Vesuvius, and of Lipari, exhibit a very imperfect\r\n      representation. The calmest and most intrepid sceptic could not\r\n      refuse to acknowledge that the destruction of the present system\r\n      of the world by fire was in itself extremely probable. The\r\n      Christian, who founded his belief much less on the fallacious\r\n      arguments of reason than on the authority of tradition and the\r\n      interpretation of Scripture, expected it with terror and\r\n      confidence as a certain and approaching event; and as his mind\r\n      was perpetually filled with the solemn idea, he considered every\r\n      disaster that happened to the empire as an infallible symptom of\r\n      an expiring world. 69\r\n\r\n      68 (return) [ Lactantius (Institut.

There were many who felt a sincere compassion for the\r\n      danger of their friends and countrymen, and who exerted the most\r\n      benevolent zeal to save them from the impending destruction.\r\n\r\n      The careless Polytheist, assailed by new and unexpected terrors,\r\n      against which neither his priests nor his philosophers could\r\n      afford him any certain protection, was very frequently terrified\r\n      and subdued by the menace of eternal tortures. His fears might\r\n      assist the progress of his faith and reason; and if he could once\r\n      persuade himself to suspect that the Christian religion might\r\n      possibly be true, it became an easy task to convince him that it\r\n      was the safest and most prudent party that he could possibly\r\n      embrace.\r\n\r\n      III. The supernatural gifts, which even in this life were\r\n      ascribed to the Christians above the rest of mankind, must have\r\n      conduced to their own comfort, and very frequently to the\r\n      conviction of infidels. Besides the occasional prodigies, which\r\n      might sometimes be effected by the immediate interposition of the\r\n      Deity when he suspended the laws of Nature for the service of\r\n      religion, the Christian church, from the time of the apostles and\r\n      their first disciples, 73 has claimed an uninterrupted succession\r\n      of miraculous powers, the gift of tongues, of vision, and of\r\n      prophecy, the power of expelling dæmons, of healing the sick, and\r\n      of raising the dead. The knowledge of foreign languages was\r\n      frequently communicated to the contemporaries of Irenæus, though\r\n      Irenæus himself was left to struggle with the difficulties of a\r\n      barbarous dialect, whilst he preached the gospel to the natives\r\n      of Gaul. 74 The divine inspiration, whether it was conveyed in\r\n      the form of a waking or of a sleeping vision, is described as a\r\n      favor very liberally bestowed on all ranks of the faithful, on\r\n      women as on elders, on boys as well as upon bishops. When their\r\n      devout minds were sufficiently prepared by a course of prayer, of\r\n      fasting, and of vigils, to receive the extraordinary impulse,\r\n      they were transported out of their senses, and delivered in\r\n      ecstasy what was inspired, being mere organs of the Holy Spirit,\r\n      just as a pipe or flute is of him who blows into it. 75 We may\r\n      add, that the design of these visions was, for the most part,\r\n      either to disclose the future history, or to guide the present\r\n      administration, of the church. The expulsion of the dæmons from\r\n      the bodies of those unhappy persons whom they had been permitted\r\n      to torment, was considered as a signal though ordinary triumph of\r\n      religion, and is repeatedly alleged by the ancient apoligists, as\r\n      the most convincing evidence of the truth of Christianity. The\r\n      awful ceremony was usually performed in a public manner, and in\r\n      the presence of a great number of spectators; the patient was\r\n      relieved by the power or skill of the exorcist, and the\r\n      vanquished dæmon was heard to confess that he was one of the\r\n      fabled gods of antiquity, who had impiously usurped the adoration\r\n      of mankind. 76 But the miraculous cure of diseases of the most\r\n      inveterate or even preternatural kind can no longer occasion any\r\n      surprise, when we recollect, that in the days of Irenæus, about\r\n      the end of the second century, the resurrection of the dead was\r\n      very far from being esteemed an uncommon event; that the miracle\r\n      was frequently performed on necessary occasions, by great fasting\r\n      and the joint supplication of the church of the place, and that\r\n      the persons thus restored to their prayers had lived afterwards\r\n      among them many years. 77 At such a period, when faith could\r\n      boast of so many wonderful victories over death, it seems\r\n      difficult to account for the scepticism of those philosophers,\r\n      who still rejected and derided the doctrine of the resurrection.\r\n      A noble Grecian had rested on this important ground the whole\r\n      controversy, and promised Theophilus, Bishop of Antioch, that if\r\n      he could be gratified with the sight of a single person who had\r\n      been actually raised from the dead, he would immediately embrace\r\n      the Christian religion. It is somewhat remarkable, that the\r\n      prelate of the first eastern church, however anxious for the\r\n      conversion of his friend, thought proper to decline this fair and\r\n      reasonable challenge. 78\r\n\r\n      73 (return) [ Notwithstanding the evasions of Dr. Middleton, it\r\n      is impossible to overlook the clear traces of visions and\r\n      inspiration, which may be found in the apostolic fathers. * Note:\r\n      Gibbon should have noticed the distinct and remarkable passage\r\n      from Chrysostom, quoted by Middleton, (Works, vol. i. p. 105,) in\r\n      which he affirms the long discontinuance of miracles as a\r\n      notorious fact.—M.]\r\n\r\n      74 (return) [ Irenæus adv.

The duty of an\r\n      historian does not call upon him to interpose his private\r\n      judgment in this nice and important controversy; but he ought not\r\n      to dissemble the difficulty of adopting such a theory as may\r\n      reconcile the interest of religion with that of reason, of making\r\n      a proper application of that theory, and of defining with\r\n      precision the limits of that happy period, exempt from error and\r\n      from deceit, to which we might be disposed to extend the gift of\r\n      supernatural powers. From the first of the fathers to the last of\r\n      the popes, a succession of bishops, of saints, of martyrs, and of\r\n      miracles, is continued without interruption; and the progress of\r\n      superstition was so gradual, and almost imperceptible, that we\r\n      know not in what particular link we should break the chain of\r\n      tradition. Every age bears testimony to the wonderful events by\r\n      which it was distinguished, and its testimony appears no less\r\n      weighty and respectable than that of the preceding generation,\r\n      till we are insensibly led on to accuse our own inconsistency, if\r\n      in the eighth or in the twelfth century we deny to the venerable\r\n      Bede, or to the holy Bernard, the same degree of confidence\r\n      which, in the second century, we had so liberally granted to\r\n      Justin or to Irenæus. 81 If the truth of any of those miracles is\r\n      appreciated by their apparent use and propriety, every age had\r\n      unbelievers to convince, heretics to confute, and idolatrous\r\n      nations to convert; and sufficient motives might always be\r\n      produced to justify the interposition of Heaven. And yet, since\r\n      every friend to revelation is persuaded of the reality, and every\r\n      reasonable man is convinced of the cessation, of miraculous\r\n      powers, it is evident that there must have been _some period_ in\r\n      which they were either suddenly or gradually withdrawn from the\r\n      Christian church. Whatever æra is chosen for that purpose, the\r\n      death of the apostles, the conversion of the Roman empire, or the\r\n      extinction of the Arian heresy, 82 the insensibility of the\r\n      Christians who lived at that time will equally afford a just\r\n      matter of surprise. They still supported their pretensions after\r\n      they had lost their power. Credulity performed the office of\r\n      faith; fanaticism was permitted to assume the language of\r\n      inspiration, and the effects of accident or contrivance were\r\n      ascribed to supernatural causes. The recent experience of genuine\r\n      miracles should have instructed the Christian world in the ways\r\n      of Providence, and habituated their eye (if we may use a very\r\n      inadequate expression) to the style of the divine artist. Should\r\n      the most skilful painter of modern Italy presume to decorate his\r\n      feeble imitations with the name of Raphæl or of Correggio, the\r\n      insolent fraud would be soon discovered, and indignantly\r\n      rejected.\r\n\r\n      79 (return) [ Dr. Middleton sent out his Introduction in the year\r\n      1747, published his Free Inquiry in 1749, and before his death,\r\n      which happened in 1750, he had prepared a vindication of it\r\n      against his numerous adversaries.]\r\n\r\n      80 (return) [ The university of Oxford conferred degrees on his\r\n      opponents.

The more rational divines are\r\n      unwilling to admit the miracles of the ivth, whilst the more\r\n      credulous are unwilling to reject those of the vth century. *\r\n      Note: All this appears to proceed on the principle that any\r\n      distinct line can be drawn in an unphilosophic age between\r\n      wonders and miracles, or between what piety, from their\r\n      unexpected and extraordinary nature, the marvellous concurrence\r\n      of secondary causes to some remarkable end, may consider\r\n      providential interpositions, and miracles strictly so called, in\r\n      which the laws of nature are suspended or violated. It is\r\n      impossible to assign, on one side, limits to human credulity, on\r\n      the other, to the influence of the imagination on the bodily\r\n      frame; but some of the miracles recorded in the Gospels are such\r\n      palpable impossibilities, according to the known laws and\r\n      operations of nature, that if recorded on sufficient evidence,\r\n      and the evidence we believe to be that of eye-witnesses, we\r\n      cannot reject them, without either asserting, with Hume, that no\r\n      evidence can prove a miracle, or that the Author of Nature has no\r\n      power of suspending its ordinary laws. But which of the\r\n      post-apostolic miracles will bear this test?—M.]\r\n\r\n      Whatever opinion may be entertained of the miracles of the\r\n      primitive church since the time of the apostles, this unresisting\r\n      softness of temper, so conspicuous among the believers of the\r\n      second and third centuries, proved of some accidental benefit to\r\n      the cause of truth and religion. In modern times, a latent and\r\n      even involuntary scepticism adheres to the most pious\r\n      dispositions. Their admission of supernatural truths is much less\r\n      an active consent than a cold and passive acquiescence.\r\n      Accustomed long since to observe and to respect the invariable\r\n      order of Nature, our reason, or at least our imagination, is not\r\n      sufficiently prepared to sustain the visible action of the Deity.\r\n\r\n      But, in the first ages of Christianity, the situation of mankind\r\n      was extremely different. The most curious, or the most credulous,\r\n      among the Pagans, were often persuaded to enter into a society\r\n      which asserted an actual claim of miraculous powers. The\r\n      primitive Christians perpetually trod on mystic ground, and their\r\n      minds were exercised by the habits of believing the most\r\n      extraordinary events. They felt, or they fancied, that on every\r\n      side they were incessantly assaulted by dæmons, comforted by\r\n      visions, instructed by prophecy, and surprisingly delivered from\r\n      danger, sickness, and from death itself, by the supplications of\r\n      the church. The real or imaginary prodigies, of which they so\r\n      frequently conceived themselves to be the objects, the\r\n      instruments, or the spectators, very happily disposed them to\r\n      adopt with the same ease, but with far greater justice, the\r\n      authentic wonders of the evangelic history; and thus miracles\r\n      that exceeded not the measure of their own experience, inspired\r\n      them with the most lively assurance of mysteries which were\r\n      acknowledged to surpass the limits of their understanding. It is\r\n      this deep impression of supernatural truths which has been so\r\n      much celebrated under the name of faith; a state of mind\r\n      described as the surest pledge of the divine favor and of future\r\n      felicity, and recommended as the first, or perhaps the only merit\r\n      of a Christian. According to the more rigid doctors, the moral\r\n      virtues, which may be equally practised by infidels, are\r\n      destitute of any value or efficacy in the work of our\r\n      justification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter XV: Progress Of The Christian Religion.—Part V.\r\n\r\n      IV. But the primitive Christian demonstrated his faith by his\r\n      virtues; and it was very justly supposed that the divine\r\n      persuasion, which enlightened or subdued the understanding, must,\r\n      at the same time, purify the heart, and direct the actions, of\r\n      the believer. The first apologists of Christianity who justify\r\n      the innocence of their brethren, and the writers of a later\r\n      period who celebrate the sanctity of their ancestors, display, in\r\n      the most lively colors, the reformation of manners which was\r\n      introduced into the world by the preaching of the gospel. As it\r\n      is my intention to remark only such human causes as were\r\n      permitted to second the influence of revelation, I shall slightly\r\n      mention two motives which might naturally render the lives of the\r\n      primitive Christians much purer and more austere than those of\r\n      their Pagan contemporaries, or their degenerate successors;\r\n      repentance for their past sins, and the laudable desire of\r\n      supporting the reputation of the society in which they were\r\n      engaged. 83\r\n\r\n      83 (return) [ These, in the opinion of the editor, are the most\r\n      uncandid paragraphs in Gibbon’s History. He ought either, with\r\n      manly courage, to have denied the moral reformation introduced by\r\n      Christianity, or fairly to have investigated all its motives; not\r\n      to have confined himself to an insidious and sarcastic\r\n      description of the less pure and generous elements of the\r\n      Christian character as it appeared even at that early time.—M.]\r\n\r\n      It is a very ancient reproach, suggested by the ignorance or the\r\n      malice of infidelity, that the Christians allured into their\r\n      party the most atrocious criminals, who, as soon as they were\r\n      touched by a sense of remorse, were easily persuaded to wash\r\n      away, in the water of baptism, the guilt of their past conduct,\r\n      for which the temples of the gods refused to grant them any\r\n      expiation. But this reproach, when it is cleared from\r\n      misrepresentation, contributes as much to the honor as it did to\r\n      the increase of the church. The friends of Christianity may\r\n      acknowledge without a blush that many of the most eminent saints\r\n      had been before their baptism the most abandoned sinners. Those\r\n      persons, who in the world had followed, though in an imperfect\r\n      manner, the dictates of benevolence and propriety, derived such a\r\n      calm satisfaction from the opinion of their own rectitude, as\r\n      rendered them much less susceptible of the sudden emotions of\r\n      shame, of grief, and of terror, which have given birth to so many\r\n      wonderful conversions. After the example of their divine Master,\r\n      the missionaries of the gospel disdained not the society of men,\r\n      and especially of women, oppressed by the consciousness, and very\r\n      often by the effects, of their vices. As they emerged from sin\r\n      and superstition to the glorious hope of immortality, they\r\n      resolved to devote themselves to a life, not only of virtue, but\r\n      of penitence. The desire of perfection became the ruling passion\r\n      of their soul; and it is well known that, while reason embraces a\r\n      cold mediocrity, our passions hurry us, with rapid violence, over\r\n      the space which lies between the most opposite extremes. 83b\r\n\r\n      83b (return) [The imputations of Celsus and Julian, with the\r\n      defence of the fathers, are very fairly stated by Spanheim,\r\n      Commentaire sur les Cesars de Julian, p. 468.]\r\n\r\n      When the new converts had been enrolled in the number of the\r\n      faithful, and were admitted to the sacraments of the church, they\r\n      found themselves restrained from relapsing into their past\r\n      disorders by another consideration of a less spiritual, but of a\r\n      very innocent and respectable nature. Any particular society that\r\n      has departed from the great body of the nation, or the religion\r\n      to which it belonged, immediately becomes the object of universal\r\n      as well as invidious observation. In proportion to the smallness\r\n      of its numbers, the character of the society may be affected by\r\n      the virtues and vices of the persons who compose it; and every\r\n      member is engaged to watch with the most vigilant attention over\r\n      his own behavior, and over that of his brethren, since, as he\r\n      must expect to incur a part of the common disgrace, he may hope\r\n      to enjoy a share of the common reputation. When the Christians of\r\n      Bithynia were brought before the tribunal of the younger Pliny,\r\n      they assured the proconsul, that, far from being engaged in any\r\n      unlawful conspiracy, they were bound by a solemn obligation to\r\n      abstain from the commission of those crimes which disturb the\r\n      private or public peace of society, from theft, robbery,\r\n      adultery, perjury, and fraud. 84 841 Near a century afterwards,\r\n      Tertullian, with an honest pride, could boast, that very few\r\n      Christians had suffered by the hand of the executioner, except on\r\n      account of their religion. 85 Their serious and sequestered life,\r\n      averse to the gay luxury of the age, inured them to chastity,\r\n      temperance, economy, and all the sober and domestic virtues.

The bishops and doctors of\r\n      the church, whose evidence attests, and whose authority might\r\n      influence, the professions, the principles, and even the practice\r\n      of their contemporaries, had studied the Scriptures with less\r\n      skill than devotion; and they often received, in the most literal\r\n      sense, those rigid precepts of Christ and the apostles, to which\r\n      the prudence of succeeding commentators has applied a looser and\r\n      more figurative mode of interpretation.

If the former is refined by art\r\n      and learning, improved by the charms of social intercourse, and\r\n      corrected by a just regard to economy, to health, and to\r\n      reputation, it is productive of the greatest part of the\r\n      happiness of private life. The love of action is a principle of a\r\n      much stronger and more doubtful nature. It often leads to anger,\r\n      to ambition, and to revenge; but when it is guided by the sense\r\n      of propriety and benevolence, it becomes the parent of every\r\n      virtue, and if those virtues are accompanied with equal\r\n      abilities, a family, a state, or an empire may be indebted for\r\n      their safety and prosperity to the undaunted courage of a single\r\n      man. To the love of pleasure we may therefore ascribe most of the\r\n      agreeable, to the love of action we may attribute most of the\r\n      useful and respectable, qualifications. The character in which\r\n      both the one and the other should be united and harmonized would\r\n      seem to constitute the most perfect idea of human nature.

Such amusements, however,\r\n      were rejected with abhorrence, or admitted with the utmost\r\n      caution, by the severity of the fathers, who despised all\r\n      knowledge that was not useful to salvation, and who considered\r\n      all levity of discours as a criminal abuse of the gift of speech.\r\n      In our present state of existence the body is so inseparably\r\n      connected with the soul, that it seems to be our interest to\r\n      taste, with innocence and moderation, the enjoyments of which\r\n      that faithful companion is susceptible. Very different was the\r\n      reasoning of our devout predecessors; vainly aspiring to imitate\r\n      the perfection of angels, they disdained, or they affected to\r\n      disdain, every earthly and corporeal delight. 88 Some of our\r\n      senses indeed are necessary for our preservation, others for our\r\n      subsistence, and others again for our information; and thus far\r\n      it was impossible to reject the use of them. The first sensation\r\n      of pleasure was marked as the first moment of their abuse. The\r\n      unfeeling candidate for heaven was instructed, not only to resist\r\n      the grosser allurements of the taste or smell, but even to shut\r\n      his ears against the profane harmony of sounds, and to view with\r\n      indifference the most finished productions of human art. Gay\r\n      apparel, magnificent houses, and elegant furniture, were supposed\r\n      to unite the double guilt of pride and of sensuality; a simple\r\n      and mortified appearance was more suitable to the Christian who\r\n      was certain of his sins and doubtful of his salvation. In their\r\n      censures of luxury the fathers are extremely minute and\r\n      circumstantial; 89 and among the various articles which excite\r\n      their pious indignation we may enumerate false hair, garments of\r\n      any color except white, instruments of music, vases of gold or\r\n      silver, downy pillows, (as Jacob reposed his head on a stone,)\r\n      white bread, foreign wines, public salutations, the use of warm\r\n      baths, and the practice of shaving the beard, which, according to\r\n      the expression of Tertullian, is a lie against our own faces, and\r\n      an impious attempt to improve the works of the Creator. 90 When\r\n      Christianity was introduced among the rich and the polite, the\r\n      observation of these singular laws was left, as it would be at\r\n      present, to the few who were ambitious of superior sanctity. But\r\n      it is always easy, as well as agreeable, for the inferior ranks\r\n      of mankind to claim a merit from the contempt of that pomp and\r\n      pleasure which fortune has placed beyond their reach. The virtue\r\n      of the primitive Christians, like that of the first Romans, was\r\n      very frequently guarded by poverty and ignorance.\r\n\r\n      88 (return) [ Lactant. Institut.

Pædagog. l. iii. c. 8.]\r\n\r\n      The chaste severity of the fathers, in whatever related to the\r\n      commerce of the two sexes, flowed from the same principle; their\r\n      abhorrence of every enjoyment which might gratify the sensual,\r\n      and degrade the spiritual nature of man. It was their favorite\r\n      opinion, that if Adam had preserved his obedience to the Creator,\r\n      he would have lived forever in a state of virgin purity, and that\r\n      some harmless mode of vegetation might have peopled paradise with\r\n      a race of innocent and immortal beings. 91 The use of marriage\r\n      was permitted only to his fallen posterity, as a necessary\r\n      expedient to continue the human species, and as a restraint,\r\n      however imperfect, on the natural licentiousness of desire. The\r\n      hesitation of the orthodox casuists on this interesting subject,\r\n      betrays the perplexity of men, unwilling to approve an\r\n      institution which they were compelled to tolerate. 92 The\r\n      enumeration of the very whimsical laws, which they most\r\n      circumstantially imposed on the marriage-bed, would force a smile\r\n      from the young and a blush from the fair. It was their unanimous\r\n      sentiment that a first marriage was adequate to all the purposes\r\n      of nature and of society. The sensual connection was refined into\r\n      a resemblance of the mystic union of Christ with his church, and\r\n      was pronounced to be indissoluble either by divorce or by death.\r\n      The practice of second nuptials was branded with the name of a\r\n      legal adultery; and the persons who were guilty of so scandalous\r\n      an offence against Christian purity, were soon excluded from the\r\n      honors, and even from the alms, of the church. 93 Since desire\r\n      was imputed as a crime, and marriage was tolerated as a defect,\r\n      it was consistent with the same principles to consider a state of\r\n      celibacy as the nearest approach to the divine perfection. It was\r\n      with the utmost difficulty that ancient Rome could support the\r\n      institution of six vestals; 94 but the primitive church was\r\n      filled with a number of persons of either sex, who had devoted\r\n      themselves to the profession of perpetual chastity. 95 A few of\r\n      these, among whom we may reckon the learned Origen, judged it the\r\n      most prudent to disarm the tempter. 96 Some were insensible and\r\n      some were invincible against the assaults of the flesh.\r\n      Disdaining an ignominious flight, the virgins of the warm climate\r\n      of Africa encountered the enemy in the closest engagement; they\r\n      permitted priests and deacons to share their bed, and gloried\r\n      amidst the flames in their unsullied purity. But insulted Nature\r\n      sometimes vindicated her rights, and this new species of\r\n      martyrdom served only to introduce a new scandal into the church.\r\n      97 Among the Christian ascetics, however, (a name which they soon\r\n      acquired from their painful exercise,) many, as they were less\r\n      presumptuous, were probably more successful. The loss of sensual\r\n      pleasure was supplied and compensated by spiritual pride. Even\r\n      the multitude of Pagans were inclined to estimate the merit of\r\n      the sacrifice by its apparent difficulty; and it was in the\r\n      praise of these chaste spouses of Christ that the fathers have\r\n      poured forth the troubled stream of their eloquence. 98 Such are\r\n      the early traces of monastic principles and institutions, which,\r\n      in a subsequent age, have counterbalanced all the temporal\r\n      advantages of Christianity. 99\r\n\r\n      91 (return) [ Beausobro, Hist.

The defence of our persons and property\r\n      they knew not how to reconcile with the patient doctrine which\r\n      enjoined an unlimited forgiveness of past injuries, and commanded\r\n      them to invite the repetition of fresh insults. Their simplicity\r\n      was offended by the use of oaths, by the pomp of magistracy, and\r\n      by the active contention of public life; nor could their humane\r\n      ignorance be convinced that it was lawful on any occasion to shed\r\n      the blood of our fellow-creatures, either by the sword of\r\n      justice, or by that of war; even though their criminal or hostile\r\n      attempts should threaten the peace and safety of the whole\r\n      community. 100 It was acknowledged that, under a less perfect\r\n      law, the powers of the Jewish constitution had been exercised,\r\n      with the approbation of heaven, by inspired prophets and by\r\n      anointed kings. The Christians felt and confessed that such\r\n      institutions might be necessary for the present system of the\r\n      world, and they cheerfully submitted to the authority of their\r\n      Pagan governors. But while they inculcated the maxims of passive\r\n      obedience, they refused to take any active part in the civil\r\n      administration or the military defence of the empire. Some\r\n      indulgence might, perhaps, be allowed to those persons who,\r\n      before their conversion, were already engaged in such violent and\r\n      sanguinary occupations; 101a but it was impossible that the\r\n      Christians, without renouncing a more sacred duty, could assume\r\n      the character of soldiers, of magistrates, or of princes. 102b\r\n      This indolent, or even criminal disregard to the public welfare,\r\n      exposed them to the contempt and reproaches of the Pagans, who\r\n      very frequently asked, what must be the fate of the empire,\r\n      attacked on every side by the barbarians, if all mankind should\r\n      adopt the pusillanimous sentiments of the new sect. 103 To this\r\n      insulting question the Christian apologists returned obscure and\r\n      ambiguous answers, as they were unwilling to reveal the secret\r\n      cause of their security; the expectation that, before the\r\n      conversion of mankind was accomplished, war, government, the\r\n      Roman empire, and the world itself, would be no more. It may be\r\n      observed, that, in this instance likewise, the situation of the\r\n      first Christians coincided very happily with their religious\r\n      scruples, and that their aversion to an active life contributed\r\n      rather to excuse them from the service, than to exclude them from\r\n      the honors, of the state and army.\r\n\r\n      100 (return) [ See the Morale des Peres.

As Christians,\r\n      they could not enter into the senate, which, according to Gibbon\r\n      himself, always assembled in a temple or consecrated place, and\r\n      where each senator, before he took his seat, made a libation of a\r\n      few drops of wine, and burnt incense on the altar; as Christians,\r\n      they could not assist at festivals and banquets, which always\r\n      terminated with libations, &c.; finally, as “the innumerable\r\n      deities and rites of polytheism were closely interwoven with\r\n      every circumstance of public and private life,” the Christians\r\n      could not participate in them without incurring, according to\r\n      their principles, the guilt of impiety. It was then much less by\r\n      an effect of their doctrine, than by the consequence of their\r\n      situation, that they stood aloof from public business. Whenever\r\n      this situation offered no impediment, they showed as much\r\n      activity as the Pagans.

But the human character, however it may be exalted or\r\n      depressed by a temporary enthusiasm, will return by degrees to\r\n      its proper and natural level, and will resume those passions that\r\n      seem the most adapted to its present condition. The primitive\r\n      Christians were dead to the business and pleasures of the world;\r\n      but their love of action, which could never be entirely\r\n      extinguished, soon revived, and found a new occupation in the\r\n      government of the church. A separate society, which attacked the\r\n      established religion of the empire, was obliged to adopt some\r\n      form of internal policy, and to appoint a sufficient number of\r\n      ministers, intrusted not only with the spiritual functions, but\r\n      even with the temporal direction of the Christian commonwealth.\r\n      The safety of that society, its honor, its aggrandizement, were\r\n      productive, even in the most pious minds, of a spirit of\r\n      patriotism, such as the first of the Romans had felt for the\r\n      republic, and sometimes of a similar indifference, in the use of\r\n      whatever means might probably conduce to so desirable an end. The\r\n      ambition of raising themselves or their friends to the honors and\r\n      offices of the church, was disguised by the laudable intention of\r\n      devoting to the public benefit the power and consideration,\r\n      which, for that purpose only, it became their duty to solicit. In\r\n      the exercise of their functions, they were frequently called upon\r\n      to detect the errors of heresy or the arts of faction, to oppose\r\n      the designs of perfidious brethren, to stigmatize their\r\n      characters with deserved infamy, and to expel them from the bosom\r\n      of a society whose peace and happiness they had attempted to\r\n      disturb. The ecclesiastical governors of the Christians were\r\n      taught to unite the wisdom of the serpent with the innocence of\r\n      the dove; but as the former was refined, so the latter was\r\n      insensibly corrupted, by the habits of government. In the church\r\n      as well as in the world, the persons who were placed in any\r\n      public station rendered themselves considerable by their\r\n      eloquence and firmness, by their knowledge of mankind, and by\r\n      their dexterity in business; and while they concealed from\r\n      others, and perhaps from themselves, the secret motives of their\r\n      conduct, they too frequently relapsed into all the turbulent\r\n      passions of active life, which were tinctured with an additional\r\n      degree of bitterness and obstinacy from the infusion of spiritual\r\n      zeal.\r\n\r\n      The government of the church has often been the subject, as well\r\n      as the prize, of religious contention. The hostile disputants of\r\n      Rome, of Paris, of Oxford, and of Geneva, have alike struggled to\r\n      reduce the primitive and apostolic model 1041 to the respective\r\n      standards of their own policy. The few who have pursued this\r\n      inquiry with more candor and impartiality, are of opinion, 105\r\n      that the apostles declined the office of legislation, and rather\r\n      chose to endure some partial scandals and divisions, than to\r\n      exclude the Christians of a future age from the liberty of\r\n      varying their forms of ecclesiastical government according to the\r\n      changes of times and circumstances. The scheme of policy, which,\r\n      under their approbation, was adopted for the use of the first\r\n      century, may be discovered from the practice of Jerusalem, of\r\n      Ephesus, or of Corinth. The societies which were instituted in\r\n      the cities of the Roman empire were united only by the ties of\r\n      faith and charity. Independence and equality formed the basis of\r\n      their internal constitution. The want of discipline and human\r\n      learning was supplied by the occasional assistance of the\r\n      _prophets_, 106 who were called to that function without\r\n      distinction of age, of sex, 1061 or of natural abilities, and\r\n      who, as often as they felt the divine impulse, poured forth the\r\n      effusions of the Spirit in the assembly of the faithful. But\r\n      these extraordinary gifts were frequently abused or misapplied by\r\n      the prophetic teachers. They displayed them at an improper\r\n      season, presumptuously disturbed the service of the assembly,\r\n      and, by their pride or mistaken zeal, they introduced,\r\n      particularly into the apostolic church of Corinth, a long and\r\n      melancholy train of disorders. 107 As the institution of prophets\r\n      became useless, and even pernicious, their powers were withdrawn,\r\n      and their office abolished. The public functions of religion were\r\n      solely intrusted to the established ministers of the church, the\r\n      _bishops_ and the _presbyters;_ two appellations which, in their\r\n      first origin, appear to have distinguished the same office and\r\n      the same order of persons. The name of Presbyter was expressive\r\n      of their age, or rather of their gravity and wisdom. The title of\r\n      Bishop denoted their inspection over the faith and manners of the\r\n      Christians who were committed to their pastoral care. In\r\n      proportion to the respective numbers of the faithful, a larger or\r\n      smaller number of these _episcopal presbyters_ guided each infant\r\n      congregation with equal authority and with united counsels. 108\r\n\r\n      1041 (return) [ The aristocratical party in France, as well as in\r\n      England, has strenuously maintained the divine origin of bishops.\r\n      But the Calvinistical presbyters were impatient of a superior;\r\n      and the Roman Pontiff refused to acknowledge an equal.

A regard for the\r\n      public tranquillity, which would so frequently have been\r\n      interrupted by annual or by occasional elections, induced the\r\n      primitive Christians to constitute an honorable and perpetual\r\n      magistracy, and to choose one of the wisest and most holy among\r\n      their presbyters to execute, during his life, the duties of their\r\n      ecclesiastical governor. It was under these circumstances that\r\n      the lofty title of Bishop began to raise itself above the humble\r\n      appellation of Presbyter; and while the latter remained the most\r\n      natural distinction for the members of every Christian senate,\r\n      the former was appropriated to the dignity of its new president.\r\n      109 The advantages of this episcopal form of government, which\r\n      appears to have been introduced before the end of the first\r\n      century, 110 were so obvious, and so important for the future\r\n      greatness, as well as the present peace, of Christianity, that it\r\n      was adopted without delay by all the societies which were already\r\n      scattered over the empire, had acquired in a very early period\r\n      the sanction of antiquity, 111 and is still revered by the most\r\n      powerful churches, both of the East and of the West, as a\r\n      primitive and even as a divine establishment. 112 It is needless\r\n      to observe, that the pious and humble presbyters, who were first\r\n      dignified with the episcopal title, could not possess, and would\r\n      probably have rejected, the power and pomp which now encircles\r\n      the tiara of the Roman pontiff, or the mitre of a German prelate.\r\n      But we may define, in a few words, the narrow limits of their\r\n      original jurisdiction, which was chiefly of a spiritual, though\r\n      in some instances of a temporal nature. 113 It consisted in the\r\n      administration of the sacraments and discipline of the church,\r\n      the superintendency of religious ceremonies, which imperceptibly\r\n      increased in number and variety, the consecration of\r\n      ecclesiastical ministers, to whom the bishop assigned their\r\n      respective functions, the management of the public fund, and the\r\n      determination of all such differences as the faithful were\r\n      unwilling to expose before the tribunal of an idolatrous judge.\r\n      These powers, during a short period, were exercised according to\r\n      the advice of the presbyteral college, and with the consent and\r\n      approbation of the assembly of Christians. The primitive bishops\r\n      were considered only as the first of their equals, and the\r\n      honorable servants of a free people.

Every society formed within itself a separate and\r\n      independent republic; and although the most distant of these\r\n      little states maintained a mutual as well as friendly intercourse\r\n      of letters and deputations, the Christian world was not yet\r\n      connected by any supreme authority or legislative assembly. As\r\n      the numbers of the faithful were gradually multiplied, they\r\n      discovered the advantages that might result from a closer union\r\n      of their interest and designs. Towards the end of the second\r\n      century, the churches of Greece and Asia adopted the useful\r\n      institutions of provincial synods, 1141 and they may justly be\r\n      supposed to have borrowed the model of a representative council\r\n      from the celebrated examples of their own country, the\r\n      Amphictyons, the Achæan league, or the assemblies of the Ionian\r\n      cities. It was soon established as a custom and as a law, that\r\n      the bishops of the independent churches should meet in the\r\n      capital of the province at the stated periods of spring and\r\n      autumn. Their deliberations were assisted by the advice of a few\r\n      distinguished presbyters, and moderated by the presence of a\r\n      listening multitude. 115 Their decrees, which were styled Canons,\r\n      regulated every important controversy of faith and discipline;\r\n      and it was natural to believe that a liberal effusion of the Holy\r\n      Spirit would be poured on the united assembly of the delegates of\r\n      the Christian people. The institution of synods was so well\r\n      suited to private ambition, and to public interest, that in the\r\n      space of a few years it was received throughout the whole empire.\r\n      A regular correspondence was established between the provincial\r\n      councils, which mutually communicated and approved their\r\n      respective proceedings; and the catholic church soon assumed the\r\n      form, and acquired the strength, of a great fœderative republic.\r\n      116\r\n\r\n      1141 (return) [ The synods were not the first means taken by the\r\n      insulated churches to enter into communion and to assume a\r\n      corporate character.

The dioceses were not\r\n      formed before the beginning of the second century: before that\r\n      time the Christians had not established sufficient churches in\r\n      the country to stand in need of that union. It is towards the\r\n      middle of the same century that we discover the first traces of\r\n      the metropolitan constitution.

The\r\n      prelates of the third century imperceptibly changed the language\r\n      of exhortation into that of command, scattered the seeds of\r\n      future usurpations, and supplied, by scripture allegories and\r\n      declamatory rhetoric, their deficiency of force and of reason.\r\n      They exalted the unity and power of the church, as it was\r\n      represented in the episcopal office, of which every bishop\r\n      enjoyed an equal and undivided portion. 117 Princes and\r\n      magistrates, it was often repeated, might boast an earthly claim\r\n      to a transitory dominion; it was the episcopal authority alone\r\n      which was derived from the Deity, and extended itself over this\r\n      and over another world. The bishops were the vicegerents of\r\n      Christ, the successors of the apostles, and the mystic\r\n      substitutes of the high priest of the Mosaic law. Their exclusive\r\n      privilege of conferring the sacerdotal character invaded the\r\n      freedom both of clerical and of popular elections; and if, in the\r\n      administration of the church, they still consulted the judgment\r\n      of the presbyters, or the inclination of the people, they most\r\n      carefully inculcated the merit of such a voluntary condescension.\r\n      The bishops acknowledged the supreme authority which resided in\r\n      the assembly of their brethren; but in the government of his\r\n      peculiar diocese, each of them exacted from his _flock_ the same\r\n      implicit obedience as if that favorite metaphor had been\r\n      literally just, and as if the shepherd had been of a more exalted\r\n      nature than that of his sheep. 118 This obedience, however, was\r\n      not imposed without some efforts on one side, and some resistance\r\n      on the other. The democratical part of the constitution was, in\r\n      many places, very warmly supported by the zealous or interested\r\n      opposition of the inferior clergy. But their patriotism received\r\n      the ignominious epithets of faction and schism; and the episcopal\r\n      cause was indebted for its rapid progress to the labors of many\r\n      active prelates, who, like Cyprian of Carthage, could reconcile\r\n      the arts of the most ambitious statesman with the Christian\r\n      virtues which seem adapted to the character of a saint and\r\n      martyr. 119\r\n\r\n      117 (return) [ Cyprian, in his admired treatise De Unitate\r\n      Ecclesiæ. p. 75—86]\r\n\r\n      118 (return) [ We may appeal to the whole tenor of Cyprian’s\r\n      conduct, of his doctrine, and of his epistles.

For a very just\r\n      account of these obscure quarrels, see Mosheim, p. 497—512.]\r\n\r\n      The same causes which at first had destroyed the equality of the\r\n      presbyters introduced among the bishops a preeminence of rank,\r\n      and from thence a superiority of jurisdiction. As often as in the\r\n      spring and autumn they met in provincial synod, the difference of\r\n      personal merit and reputation was very sensibly felt among the\r\n      members of the assembly, and the multitude was governed by the\r\n      wisdom and eloquence of the few. But the order of public\r\n      proceedings required a more regular and less invidious\r\n      distinction; the office of perpetual presidents in the councils\r\n      of each province was conferred on the bishops of the principal\r\n      city; and these aspiring prelates, who soon acquired the lofty\r\n      titles of Metropolitans and Primates, secretly prepared\r\n      themselves to usurp over their episcopal brethren the same\r\n      authority which the bishops had so lately assumed above the\r\n      college of presbyters. 120 Nor was it long before an emulation of\r\n      preeminence and power prevailed among the Metropolitans\r\n      themselves, each of them affecting to display, in the most\r\n      pompous terms, the temporal honors and advantages of the city\r\n      over which he presided; the numbers and opulence of the\r\n      Christians who were subject to their pastoral care; the saints\r\n      and martyrs who had arisen among them; and the purity with which\r\n      they preserved the tradition of the faith, as it had been\r\n      transmitted through a series of orthodox bishops from the apostle\r\n      or the apostolic disciple, to whom the foundation of their church\r\n      was ascribed. 121 From every cause, either of a civil or of an\r\n      ecclesiastical nature, it was easy to foresee that Rome must\r\n      enjoy the respect, and would soon claim the obedience, of the\r\n      provinces. The society of the faithful bore a just proportion to\r\n      the capital of the empire; and the Roman church was the greatest,\r\n      the most numerous, and, in regard to the West, the most ancient\r\n      of all the Christian establishments, many of which had received\r\n      their religion from the pious labors of her missionaries. Instead\r\n      of one apostolic founder, the utmost boast of Antioch, of\r\n      Ephesus, or of Corinth, the banks of the Tyber were supposed to\r\n      have been honored with the preaching and martyrdom of the two\r\n      most eminent among the apostles; 122 and the bishops of Rome very\r\n      prudently claimed the inheritance of whatsoever prerogatives were\r\n      attributed either to the person or to the office of St. Peter.\r\n      123 The bishops of Italy and of the provinces were disposed to\r\n      allow them a primacy of order and association (such was their\r\n      very accurate expression) in the Christian aristocracy. 124 But\r\n      the power of a monarch was rejected with abhorrence, and the\r\n      aspiring genius of Rome experienced from the nations of Asia and\r\n      Africa a more vigorous resistance to her spiritual, than she had\r\n      formerly done to her temporal, dominion. The patriotic Cyprian,\r\n      who ruled with the most absolute sway the church of Carthage and\r\n      the provincial synods, opposed with resolution and success the\r\n      ambition of the Roman pontiff, artfully connected his own cause\r\n      with that of the eastern bishops, and, like Hannibal, sought out\r\n      new allies in the heart of Asia. 125 If this Punic war was\r\n      carried on without any effusion of blood, it was owing much less\r\n      to the moderation than to the weakness of the contending\r\n      prelates. Invectives and excommunications were _their_ only\r\n      weapons; and these, during the progress of the whole controversy,\r\n      they hurled against each other with equal fury and devotion.

The community of goods, which had so agreeably amused the\r\n      imagination of Plato, 128 and which subsisted in some degree\r\n      among the austere sect of the Essenians, 129 was adopted for a\r\n      short time in the primitive church. The fervor of the first\r\n      proselytes prompted them to sell those worldly possessions, which\r\n      they despised, to lay the price of them at the feet of the\r\n      apostles, and to content themselves with receiving an equal share\r\n      out of the general distribution. 130 The progress of the\r\n      Christian religion relaxed, and gradually abolished, this\r\n      generous institution, which, in hands less pure than those of the\r\n      apostles, would too soon have been corrupted and abused by the\r\n      returning selfishness of human nature; and the converts who\r\n      embraced the new religion were permitted to retain the possession\r\n      of their patrimony, to receive legacies and inheritances, and to\r\n      increase their separate property by all the lawful means of trade\r\n      and industry. Instead of an absolute sacrifice, a moderate\r\n      proportion was accepted by the ministers of the gospel; and in\r\n      their weekly or monthly assemblies, every believer, according to\r\n      the exigency of the occasion, and the measure of his wealth and\r\n      piety, presented his voluntary offering for the use of the common\r\n      fund. 131 Nothing, however inconsiderable, was refused; but it\r\n      was diligently inculcated that, in the article of Tithes, the\r\n      Mosaic law was still of divine obligation; and that since the\r\n      Jews, under a less perfect discipline, had been commanded to pay\r\n      a tenth part of all that they possessed, it would become the\r\n      disciples of Christ to distinguish themselves by a superior\r\n      degree of liberality, 132 and to acquire some merit by resigning\r\n      a superfluous treasure, which must so soon be annihilated with\r\n      the world itself. 133 It is almost unnecessary to observe, that\r\n      the revenue of each particular church, which was of so uncertain\r\n      and fluctuating a nature, must have varied with the poverty or\r\n      the opulence of the faithful, as they were dispersed in obscure\r\n      villages, or collected in the great cities of the empire. In the\r\n      time of the emperor Decius, it was the opinion of the\r\n      magistrates, that the Christians of Rome were possessed of very\r\n      considerable wealth; that vessels of gold and silver were used in\r\n      their religious worship, and that many among their proselytes had\r\n      sold their lands and houses to increase the public riches of the\r\n      sect, at the expense, indeed, of their unfortunate children, who\r\n      found themselves beggars, because their parents had been saints.\r\n      134 We should listen with distrust to the suspicions of strangers\r\n      and enemies: on this occasion, however, they receive a very\r\n      specious and probable color from the two following circumstances,\r\n      the only ones that have reached our knowledge, which define any\r\n      precise sums, or convey any distinct idea. Almost at the same\r\n      period, the bishop of Carthage, from a society less opulent than\r\n      that of Rome, collected a hundred thousand sesterces, (above\r\n      eight hundred and fifty pounds sterling,) on a sudden call of\r\n      charity to redeem the brethren of Numidia, who had been carried\r\n      away captives by the barbarians of the desert. 135 About a\r\n      hundred years before the reign of Decius, the Roman church had\r\n      received, in a single donation, the sum of two hundred thousand\r\n      sesterces from a stranger of Pontus, who proposed to fix his\r\n      residence in the capital. 136 These oblations, for the most part,\r\n      were made in money; nor was the society of Christians either\r\n      desirous or capable of acquiring, to any considerable degree, the\r\n      encumbrance of landed property. It had been provided by several\r\n      laws, which were enacted with the same design as our statutes of\r\n      mortmain, that no real estates should be given or bequeathed to\r\n      any corporate body, without either a special privilege or a\r\n      particular dispensation from the emperor or from the senate; 137\r\n      who were seldom disposed to grant them in favor of a sect, at\r\n      first the object of their contempt, and at last of their fears\r\n      and jealousy. A transaction, however, is related under the reign\r\n      of Alexander Severus, which discovers that the restraint was\r\n      sometimes eluded or suspended, and that the Christians were\r\n      permitted to claim and to possess lands within the limits of Rome\r\n      itself. 138 The progress of Christianity, and the civil confusion\r\n      of the empire, contributed to relax the severity of the laws; and\r\n      before the close of the third century many considerable estates\r\n      were bestowed on the opulent churches of Rome, Milan, Carthage,\r\n      Antioch, Alexandria, and the other great cities of Italy and the\r\n      provinces.\r\n\r\n      128 (return) [ The community instituted by Plato is more perfect\r\n      than that which Sir Thomas More had imagined for his Utopia.

By some of these unfaithful\r\n      stewards the riches of the church were lavished in sensual\r\n      pleasures; by others they were perverted to the purposes of\r\n      private gain, of fraudulent purchases, and of rapacious usury.\r\n      140 But as long as the contributions of the Christian people were\r\n      free and unconstrained, the abuse of their confidence could not\r\n      be very frequent, and the general uses to which their liberality\r\n      was applied reflected honor on the religious society. A decent\r\n      portion was reserved for the maintenance of the bishop and his\r\n      clergy; a sufficient sum was allotted for the expenses of the\r\n      public worship, of which the feasts of love, the _agapæ_, as they\r\n      were called, constituted a very pleasing part. The whole\r\n      remainder was the sacred patrimony of the poor. According to the\r\n      discretion of the bishop, it was distributed to support widows\r\n      and orphans, the lame, the sick, and the aged of the community;\r\n      to comfort strangers and pilgrims, and to alleviate the\r\n      misfortunes of prisoners and captives, more especially when their\r\n      sufferings had been occasioned by their firm attachment to the\r\n      cause of religion. 141 A generous intercourse of charity united\r\n      the most distant provinces, and the smaller congregations were\r\n      cheerfully assisted by the alms of their more opulent brethren.\r\n      142 Such an institution, which paid less regard to the merit than\r\n      to the distress of the object, very materially conduced to the\r\n      progress of Christianity. The Pagans, who were actuated by a\r\n      sense of humanity, while they derided the doctrines, acknowledged\r\n      the benevolence, of the new sect. 143 The prospect of immediate\r\n      relief and of future protection allured into its hospitable bosom\r\n      many of those unhappy persons whom the neglect of the world would\r\n      have abandoned to the miseries of want, of sickness, and of old\r\n      age. There is some reason likewise to believe that great numbers\r\n      of infants, who, according to the inhuman practice of the times,\r\n      had been exposed by their parents, were frequently rescued from\r\n      death, baptized, educated, and maintained by the piety of the\r\n      Christians, and at the expense of the public treasure. 144\r\n\r\n      139 (return) [ Constitut.

It is the undoubted right of every society to exclude from\r\n      its communion and benefits such among its members as reject or\r\n      violate those regulations which have been established by general\r\n      consent. In the exercise of this power, the censures of the\r\n      Christian church were chiefly directed against scandalous\r\n      sinners, and particularly those who were guilty of murder, of\r\n      fraud, or of incontinence; against the authors or the followers\r\n      of any heretical opinions which had been condemned by the\r\n      judgment of the episcopal order; and against those unhappy\r\n      persons, who, whether from choice or compulsion, had polluted\r\n      themselves after their baptism by any act of idolatrous worship.\r\n      The consequences of excommunication were of a temporal as well as\r\n      a spiritual nature. The Christian against whom it was pronounced\r\n      was deprived of any part in the oblations of the faithful. The\r\n      ties both of religious and of private friendship were dissolved:\r\n      he found himself a profane object of abhorrence to the persons\r\n      whom he the most esteemed, or by whom he had been the most\r\n      tenderly beloved; and as far as an expulsion from a respectable\r\n      society could imprint on his character a mark of disgrace, he was\r\n      shunned or suspected by the generality of mankind. The situation\r\n      of these unfortunate exiles was in itself very painful and\r\n      melancholy; but, as it usually happens, their apprehensions far\r\n      exceeded their sufferings. The benefits of the Christian\r\n      communion were those of eternal life; nor could they erase from\r\n      their minds the awful opinion, that to those ecclesiastical\r\n      governors by whom they were condemned, the Deity had committed\r\n      the keys of Hell and of Paradise. The heretics, indeed, who might\r\n      be supported by the consciousness of their intentions, and by the\r\n      flattering hope that they alone had discovered the true path of\r\n      salvation, endeavored to regain, in their separate assemblies,\r\n      those comforts, temporal as well as spiritual, which they no\r\n      longer derived from the great society of Christians. But almost\r\n      all those who had reluctantly yielded to the power of vice or\r\n      idolatry were sensible of their fallen condition, and anxiously\r\n      desirous of being restored to the benefits of the Christian\r\n      communion.\r\n\r\n      With regard to the treatment of these penitents, two opposite\r\n      opinions, the one of justice, the other of mercy, divided the\r\n      primitive church. The more rigid and inflexible casuists refused\r\n      them forever, and without exception, the meanest place in the\r\n      holy community, which they had disgraced or deserted; and leaving\r\n      them to the remorse of a guilty conscience, indulged them only\r\n      with a faint ray of hope that the contrition of their life and\r\n      death might possibly be accepted by the Supreme Being. 145 A\r\n      milder sentiment was embraced, in practice as well as in theory,\r\n      by the purest and most respectable of the Christian churches. 146\r\n      The gates of reconciliation and of heaven were seldom shut\r\n      against the returning penitent; but a severe and solemn form of\r\n      discipline was instituted, which, while it served to expiate his\r\n      crime, might powerfully deter the spectators from the imitation\r\n      of his example. Humbled by a public confession, emaciated by\r\n      fasting and clothed in sackcloth, the penitent lay prostrate at\r\n      the door of the assembly, imploring with tears the pardon of his\r\n      offences, and soliciting the prayers of the faithful. 147 If the\r\n      fault was of a very heinous nature, whole years of penance were\r\n      esteemed an inadequate satisfaction to the divine justice; and it\r\n      was always by slow and painful gradations that the sinner, the\r\n      heretic, or the apostate, was readmitted into the bosom of the\r\n      church. A sentence of perpetual excommunication was, however,\r\n      reserved for some crimes of an extraordinary magnitude, and\r\n      particularly for the inexcusable relapses of those penitents who\r\n      had already experienced and abused the clemency of their\r\n      ecclesiastical superiors. According to the circumstances or the\r\n      number of the guilty, the exercise of the Christian discipline\r\n      was varied by the discretion of the bishops. The councils of\r\n      Ancyra and Illiberis were held about the same time, the one in\r\n      Galatia, the other in Spain; but their respective canons, which\r\n      are still extant, seem to breathe a very different spirit. The\r\n      Galatian, who after his baptism had repeatedly sacrificed to\r\n      idols, might obtain his pardon by a penance of seven years; and\r\n      if he had seduced others to imitate his example, only three years\r\n      more were added to the term of his exile. But the unhappy\r\n      Spaniard, who had committed the same offence, was deprived of the\r\n      hope of reconciliation, even in the article of death; and his\r\n      idolatry was placed at the head of a list of seventeen other\r\n      crimes, against which a sentence no less terrible was pronounced.\r\n      Among these we may distinguish the inexpiable guilt of\r\n      calumniating a bishop, a presbyter, or even a deacon. 148\r\n\r\n      145 (return) [ The Montanists and the Novatians, who adhered to\r\n      this opinion with the greatest rigor and obstinacy, found\r\n      themselves at last in the number of excommunicated heretics.

The Bishops, whose paternal care extended itself to\r\n      the government of both worlds, were sensible of the importance of\r\n      these prerogatives; and covering their ambition with the fair\r\n      pretence of the love of order, they were jealous of any rival in\r\n      the exercise of a discipline so necessary to prevent the\r\n      desertion of those troops which had enlisted themselves under the\r\n      banner of the cross, and whose numbers every day became more\r\n      considerable. From the imperious declamations of Cyprian, we\r\n      should naturally conclude that the doctrines of excommunication\r\n      and penance formed the most essential part of religion; and that\r\n      it was much less dangerous for the disciples of Christ to neglect\r\n      the observance of the moral duties, than to despise the censures\r\n      and authority of their bishops. Sometimes we might imagine that\r\n      we were listening to the voice of Moses, when he commanded the\r\n      earth to open, and to swallow up, in consuming flames, the\r\n      rebellious race which refused obedience to the priesthood of\r\n      Aaron; and we should sometimes suppose that we heard a Roman\r\n      consul asserting the majesty of the republic, and declaring his\r\n      inflexible resolution to enforce the rigor of the laws. “If such\r\n      irregularities are suffered with impunity,” (it is thus that the\r\n      bishop of Carthage chides the lenity of his colleague,) “if such\r\n      irregularities are suffered, there is an end of EPISCOPAL VIGOR;\r\n      149 an end of the sublime and divine power of governing the\r\n      Church, an end of Christianity itself.” Cyprian had renounced\r\n      those temporal honors which it is probable he would never have\r\n      obtained; but the acquisition of such absolute command over the\r\n      consciences and understanding of a congregation, however obscure\r\n      or despised by the world, is more truly grateful to the pride of\r\n      the human heart than the possession of the most despotic power,\r\n      imposed by arms and conquest on a reluctant people.\r\n\r\n      1491] (return) [ Gibbon has been accused of injustice to the\r\n      character of Cyprian, as exalting the “censures and authority of\r\n      the church above the observance of the moral duties.”\r\n      Felicissimus had been condemned by a synod of bishops, (non\r\n      tantum mea, sed plurimorum coepiscorum, sententia condemnatum,)\r\n      on the charge not only of schism, but of embezzlement of public\r\n      money, the debauching of virgins, and frequent acts of adultery.\r\n      His violent menaces had extorted his readmission into the church,\r\n      against which Cyprian protests with much vehemence: ne pecuniæ\r\n      commissæ sibi fraudator, ne stuprator virginum, ne matrimoniorum\r\n      multorum depopulator et corruptor, ultra adhuc sponsam Christi\r\n      incorruptam præsentiæ suæ dedecore, et impudica atque incesta\r\n      contagione, violaret. See Chelsum’s Remarks, p. 134. If these\r\n      charges against Felicissimus were true, they were something more\r\n      than “irregularities,” A Roman censor would have been a fairer\r\n      subject of comparison than a consul. On the other hand, it must\r\n      be admitted that the charge of adultery deepens very rapidly as\r\n      the controversy becomes more violent.

Cave has\r\n      rather embellished Cyprian’s language.—M.]\r\n\r\n      In the course of this important, though perhaps tedious inquiry,\r\n      I have attempted to display the secondary causes which so\r\n      efficaciously assisted the truth of the Christian religion. If\r\n      among these causes we have discovered any artificial ornaments,\r\n      any accidental circumstances, or any mixture of error and\r\n      passion, it cannot appear surprising that mankind should be the\r\n      most sensibly affected by such motives as were suited to their\r\n      imperfect nature. It was by the aid of these causes, exclusive\r\n      zeal, the immediate expectation of another world, the claim of\r\n      miracles, the practice of rigid virtue, and the constitution of\r\n      the primitive church, that Christianity spread itself with so\r\n      much success in the Roman empire. To the first of these the\r\n      Christians were indebted for their invincible valor, which\r\n      disdained to capitulate with the enemy whom they were resolved to\r\n      vanquish. The three succeeding causes supplied their valor with\r\n      the most formidable arms. The last of these causes united their\r\n      courage, directed their arms, and gave their efforts that\r\n      irresistible weight, which even a small band of well-trained and\r\n      intrepid volunteers has so often possessed over an undisciplined\r\n      multitude, ignorant of the subject and careless of the event of\r\n      the war. In the various religions of Polytheism, some wandering\r\n      fanatics of Egypt and Syria, who addressed themselves to the\r\n      credulous superstition of the populace, were perhaps the only\r\n      order of priests 150 that derived their whole support and credit\r\n      from their sacerdotal profession, and were very deeply affected\r\n      by a personal concern for the safety or prosperity of their\r\n      tutelar deities. The ministers of Polytheism, both in Rome and in\r\n      the provinces, were, for the most part, men of a noble birth, and\r\n      of an affluent fortune, who received, as an honorable\r\n      distinction, the care of a celebrated temple, or of a public\r\n      sacrifice, exhibited, very frequently at their own expense, the\r\n      sacred games, 151 and with cold indifference performed the\r\n      ancient rites, according to the laws and fashion of their\r\n      country. As they were engaged in the ordinary occupations of\r\n      life, their zeal and devotion were seldom animated by a sense of\r\n      interest, or by the habits of an ecclesiastical character.\r\n      Confined to their respective temples and cities, they remained\r\n      without any connection of discipline or government; and whilst\r\n      they acknowledged the supreme jurisdiction of the senate, of the\r\n      college of pontiffs, and of the emperor, those civil magistrates\r\n      contented themselves with the easy task of maintaining in peace\r\n      and dignity the general worship of mankind. We have already seen\r\n      how various, how loose, and how uncertain were the religious\r\n      sentiments of Polytheists. They were abandoned, almost without\r\n      control, to the natural workings of a superstitious fancy. The\r\n      accidental circumstances of their life and situation determined\r\n      the object as well as the degree of their devotion; and as long\r\n      as their adoration was successively prostituted to a thousand\r\n      deities, it was scarcely possible that their hearts could be\r\n      susceptible of a very sincere or lively passion for any of them.\r\n\r\n      150 (return) [ The arts, the manners, and the vices of the\r\n      priests of the Syrian goddess are very humorously described by\r\n      Apuleius, in the eighth book of his Metamorphosis.]\r\n\r\n      151 (return) [ The office of Asiarch was of this nature, and it\r\n      is frequently mentioned in Aristides, the Inscriptions, &c. It\r\n      was annual and elective. None but the vainest citizens could\r\n      desire the honor; none but the most wealthy could support the\r\n      expense. See, in the Patres Apostol. tom. ii. p. 200, with how\r\n      much indifference Philip the Asiarch conducted himself in the\r\n      martyrdom of Polycarp. There were likewise Bithyniarchs,\r\n      Lyciarchs, &c.]\r\n\r\n      When Christianity appeared in the world, even these faint and\r\n      imperfect impressions had lost much of their original power.\r\n      Human reason, which by its unassisted strength is incapable of\r\n      perceiving the mysteries of faith, had already obtained an easy\r\n      triumph over the folly of Paganism; and when Tertullian or\r\n      Lactantius employ their labors in exposing its falsehood and\r\n      extravagance, they are obliged to transcribe the eloquence of\r\n      Cicero or the wit of Lucian. The contagion of these sceptical\r\n      writings had been diffused far beyond the number of their\r\n      readers. The fashion of incredulity was communicated from the\r\n      philosopher to the man of pleasure or business, from the noble to\r\n      the plebeian, and from the master to the menial slave who waited\r\n      at his table, and who eagerly listened to the freedom of his\r\n      conversation. On public occasions the philosophic part of mankind\r\n      affected to treat with respect and decency the religious\r\n      institutions of their country; but their secret contempt\r\n      penetrated through the thin and awkward disguise; and even the\r\n      people, when they discovered that their deities were rejected and\r\n      derided by those whose rank or understanding they were accustomed\r\n      to reverence, were filled with doubts and apprehensions\r\n      concerning the truth of those doctrines, to which they had\r\n      yielded the most implicit belief. The decline of ancient\r\n      prejudice exposed a very numerous portion of human kind to the\r\n      danger of a painful and comfortless situation. A state of\r\n      scepticism and suspense may amuse a few inquisitive minds. But\r\n      the practice of superstition is so congenial to the multitude,\r\n      that if they are forcibly awakened, they still regret the loss of\r\n      their pleasing vision. Their love of the marvellous and\r\n      supernatural, their curiosity with regard to future events, and\r\n      their strong propensity to extend their hopes and fears beyond\r\n      the limits of the visible world, were the principal causes which\r\n      favored the establishment of Polytheism. So urgent on the vulgar\r\n      is the necessity of believing, that the fall of any system of\r\n      mythology will most probably be succeeded by the introduction of\r\n      some other mode of superstition. Some deities of a more recent\r\n      and fashionable cast might soon have occupied the deserted\r\n      temples of Jupiter and Apollo, if, in the decisive moment, the\r\n      wisdom of Providence had not interposed a genuine revelation,\r\n      fitted to inspire the most rational esteem and conviction,\r\n      whilst, at the same time, it was adorned with all that could\r\n      attract the curiosity, the wonder, and the veneration of the\r\n      people. In their actual disposition, as many were almost\r\n      disengaged from their artificial prejudices, but equally\r\n      susceptible and desirous of a devout attachment; an object much\r\n      less deserving would have been sufficient to fill the vacant\r\n      place in their hearts, and to gratify the uncertain eagerness of\r\n      their passions. Those who are inclined to pursue this reflection,\r\n      instead of viewing with astonishment the rapid progress of\r\n      Christianity, will perhaps be surprised that its success was not\r\n      still more rapid and still more universal. It has been observed,\r\n      with truth as well as propriety, that the conquests of Rome\r\n      prepared and facilitated those of Christianity. In the second\r\n      chapter of this work we have attempted to explain in what manner\r\n      the most civilized provinces of Europe, Asia, and Africa were\r\n      united under the dominion of one sovereign, and gradually\r\n      connected by the most intimate ties of laws, of manners, and of\r\n      language. The Jews of Palestine, who had fondly expected a\r\n      temporal deliverer, gave so cold a reception to the miracles of\r\n      the divine prophet, that it was found unnecessary to publish, or\r\n      at least to preserve, any Hebrew gospel. 152 The authentic\r\n      histories of the actions of Christ were composed in the Greek\r\n      language, at a considerable distance from Jerusalem, and after\r\n      the Gentile converts were grown extremely numerous. 153 As soon\r\n      as those histories were translated into the Latin tongue, they\r\n      were perfectly intelligible to all the subjects of Rome,\r\n      excepting only to the peasants of Syria and Egypt, for whose\r\n      benefit particular versions were afterwards made. The public\r\n      highways, which had been constructed for the use of the legions,\r\n      opened an easy passage for the Christian missionaries from\r\n      Damascus to Corinth, and from Italy to the extremity of Spain or\r\n      Britain; nor did those spiritual conquerors encounter any of the\r\n      obstacles which usually retard or prevent the introduction of a\r\n      foreign religion into a distant country. There is the strongest\r\n      reason to believe, that before the reigns of Diocletian and\r\n      Constantine, the faith of Christ had been preached in every\r\n      province, and in all the great cities of the empire; but the\r\n      foundation of the several congregations, the numbers of the\r\n      faithful who composed them, and their proportion to the\r\n      unbelieving multitude, are now buried in obscurity, or disguised\r\n      by fiction and declamation. Such imperfect circumstances,\r\n      however, as have reached our knowledge concerning the increase of\r\n      the Christian name in Asia and Greece, in Egypt, in Italy, and in\r\n      the West, we shall now proceed to relate, without neglecting the\r\n      real or imaginary acquisitions which lay beyond the frontiers of\r\n      the Roman empire.\r\n\r\n      152 (return) [ The modern critics are not disposed to believe\r\n      what the fathers almost unanimously assert, that St. Matthew\r\n      composed a Hebrew gospel, of which only the Greek translation is\r\n      extant. It seems, however, dangerous to reject their testimony. *\r\n      Note: Strong reasons appear to confirm this testimony. Papias,\r\n      contemporary of the Apostle St. John, says positively that\r\n      Matthew had written the discourses of Jesus Christ in Hebrew, and\r\n      that each interpreted them as he could. This Hebrew was the\r\n      Syro-Chaldaic dialect, then in use at Jerusalem: Origen, Irenæus,\r\n      Eusebius, Jerome, Epiphanius, confirm this statement. Jesus\r\n      Christ preached himself in Syro-Chaldaic, as is proved by many\r\n      words which he used, and which the Evangelists have taken the\r\n      pains to translate. St. Paul, addressing the Jews, used the same\r\n      language: Acts xxi. 40, xxii. 2, xxvi. 14. The opinions of some\r\n      critics prove nothing against such undeniable testimonies.\r\n      Moreover, their principal objection is, that St. Matthew quotes\r\n      the Old Testament according to the Greek version of the LXX.,\r\n      which is inaccurate; for of ten quotations, found in his Gospel,\r\n      seven are evidently taken from the Hebrew text; the threo others\r\n      offer little that differ: moreover, the latter are not literal\r\n      quotations. St. Jerome says positively, that, according to a copy\r\n      which he had seen in the library of Cæsarea, the quotations were\r\n      made in Hebrew (in Catal.) More modern critics, among others\r\n      Michaelis, do not entertain a doubt on the subject. The Greek\r\n      version appears to have been made in the time of the apostles, as\r\n      St. Jerome and St. Augustus affirm, perhaps by one of them.—G.\r\n      ——Among modern critics, Dr. Hug has asserted the Greek original\r\n      of St. Matthew, but the general opinion of the most learned\r\n      biblical writer, supports the view of M.

The seeds of the gospel,\r\n      which he had scattered in a fertile soil, were diligently\r\n      cultivated by his disciples; and it should seem that, during the\r\n      two first centuries, the most considerable body of Christians was\r\n      contained within those limits. Among the societies which were\r\n      instituted in Syria, none were more ancient or more illustrious\r\n      than those of Damascus, of Berea or Aleppo, and of Antioch. The\r\n      prophetic introduction of the Apocalypse has described and\r\n      immortalized the seven churches of Asia; Ephesus, Smyrna,\r\n      Pergamus, Thyatira, 154 Sardes, Laodicea, and Philadelphia; and\r\n      their colonies were soon diffused over that populous country. In\r\n      a very early period, the islands of Cyprus and Crete, the\r\n      provinces of Thrace and Macedonia, gave a favorable reception to\r\n      the new religion; and Christian republics were soon founded in\r\n      the cities of Corinth, of Sparta, and of Athens. 155 The\r\n      antiquity of the Greek and Asiatic churches allowed a sufficient\r\n      space of time for their increase and multiplication; and even the\r\n      swarms of Gnostics and other heretics serve to display the\r\n      flourishing condition of the orthodox church, since the\r\n      appellation of heretics has always been applied to the less\r\n      numerous party. To these domestic testimonies we may add the\r\n      confession, the complaints, and the apprehensions of the Gentiles\r\n      themselves. From the writings of Lucian, a philosopher who had\r\n      studied mankind, and who describes their manners in the most\r\n      lively colors, we may learn that, under the reign of Commodus,\r\n      his native country of Pontus was filled with Epicureans and\r\n      _Christians_. 156 Within fourscore years after the death of\r\n      Christ, 157 the humane Pliny laments the magnitude of the evil\r\n      which he vainly attempted to eradicate. In his very curious\r\n      epistle to the emperor Trajan, he affirms that the temples were\r\n      almost deserted, that the sacred victims scarcely found any\r\n      purchasers, and that the superstition had not only infected the\r\n      cities, but had even spread itself into the villages and the open\r\n      country of Pontus and Bithynia. 158\r\n\r\n      154 (return) [ The Alogians (Epiphanius de Hæres. 51) disputed\r\n      the genuineness of the Apocalypse, because the church of Thyatira\r\n      was not yet founded.

One circumstance, however, has been\r\n      fortunately preserved, which seems to cast a more distinct light\r\n      on this obscure but interesting subject. Under the reign of\r\n      Theodosius, after Christianity had enjoyed, during more than\r\n      sixty years, the sunshine of Imperial favor, the ancient and\r\n      illustrious church of Antioch consisted of one hundred thousand\r\n      persons, three thousand of whom were supported out of the public\r\n      oblations. 159 The splendor and dignity of the queen of the East,\r\n      the acknowledged populousness of Cæsarea, Seleucia, and\r\n      Alexandria, and the destruction of two hundred and fifty thousand\r\n      souls in the earthquake which afflicted Antioch under the elder\r\n      Justin, 160 are so many convincing proofs that the whole number\r\n      of its inhabitants was not less than half a million, and that the\r\n      Christians, however multiplied by zeal and power, did not exceed\r\n      a fifth part of that great city. How different a proportion must\r\n      we adopt when we compare the persecuted with the triumphant\r\n      church, the West with the East, remote villages with populous\r\n      towns, and countries recently converted to the faith with the\r\n      place where the believers first received the appellation of\r\n      Christians! It must not, however, be dissembled, that, in another\r\n      passage, Chrysostom, to whom we are indebted for this useful\r\n      information, computes the multitude of the faithful as even\r\n      superior to that of the Jews and Pagans. 161 But the solution of\r\n      this apparent difficulty is easy and obvious. The eloquent\r\n      preacher draws a parallel between the civil and the\r\n      ecclesiastical constitution of Antioch; between the list of\r\n      Christians who had acquired heaven by baptism, and the list of\r\n      citizens who had a right to share the public liberality. Slaves,\r\n      strangers, and infants were comprised in the former; they were\r\n      excluded from the latter.\r\n\r\n      159 (return) [ Chrysostom.

It was at\r\n      first embraced by great numbers of the Theraputæ, or Essenians,\r\n      of the Lake Mareotis, a Jewish sect which had abated much of its\r\n      reverence for the Mosaic ceremonies. The austere life of the\r\n      Essenians, their fasts and excommunications, the community of\r\n      goods, the love of celibacy, their zeal for martyrdom, and the\r\n      warmth though not the purity of their faith, already offered a\r\n      very lively image of the primitive discipline. 162 It was in the\r\n      school of Alexandria that the Christian theology appears to have\r\n      assumed a regular and scientific form; and when Hadrian visited\r\n      Egypt, he found a church composed of Jews and of Greeks,\r\n      sufficiently important to attract the notice of that inquisitive\r\n      prince. 163 But the progress of Christianity was for a long time\r\n      confined within the limits of a single city, which was itself a\r\n      foreign colony, and till the close of the second century the\r\n      predecessors of Demetrius were the only prelates of the Egyptian\r\n      church. Three bishops were consecrated by the hands of Demetrius,\r\n      and the number was increased to twenty by his successor Heraclas.\r\n      164 The body of the natives, a people distinguished by a sullen\r\n      inflexibility of temper, 165 entertained the new doctrine with\r\n      coldness and reluctance; and even in the time of Origen, it was\r\n      rare to meet with an Egyptian who had surmounted his early\r\n      prejudices in favor of the sacred animals of his country. 166 As\r\n      soon, indeed, as Christianity ascended the throne, the zeal of\r\n      those barbarians obeyed the prevailing impulsion; the cities of\r\n      Egypt were filled with bishops, and the deserts of Thebais\r\n      swarmed with hermits.\r\n\r\n      162 (return) [ Basnage, Histoire des Juifs, l. 2, c. 20, 21, 22,\r\n      23, has examined with the most critical accuracy the curious\r\n      treatise of Philo, which describes the Therapeutæ. By proving\r\n      that it was composed as early as the time of Augustus, Basnage\r\n      has demonstrated, in spite of Eusebius (l. ii. c. 17) and a crowd\r\n      of modern Catholics, that the Therapeutæ were neither Christians\r\n      nor monks.

Whatever was strange or odious, whoever\r\n      was guilty or suspected, might hope, in the obscurity of that\r\n      immense capital, to elude the vigilance of the law. In such a\r\n      various conflux of nations, every teacher, either of truth or\r\n      falsehood, every founder, whether of a virtuous or a criminal\r\n      association, might easily multiply his disciples or accomplices.\r\n      The Christians of Rome, at the time of the accidental persecution\r\n      of Nero, are represented by Tacitus as already amounting to a\r\n      very great multitude, 167 and the language of that great\r\n      historian is almost similar to the style employed by Livy, when\r\n      he relates the introduction and the suppression of the rites of\r\n      Bacchus. After the Bacchanals had awakened the severity of the\r\n      senate, it was likewise apprehended that a very great multitude,\r\n      as it were _another people_, had been initiated into those\r\n      abhorred mysteries. A more careful inquiry soon demonstrated that\r\n      the offenders did not exceed seven thousand; a number indeed\r\n      sufficiently alarming, when considered as the object of public\r\n      justice. 168 It is with the same candid allowance that we should\r\n      interpret the vague expressions of Tacitus, and in a former\r\n      instance of Pliny, when they exaggerate the crowds of deluded\r\n      fanatics who had forsaken the established worship of the gods.\r\n      The church of Rome was undoubtedly the first and most populous of\r\n      the empire; and we are possessed of an authentic record which\r\n      attests the state of religion in that city about the middle of\r\n      the third century, and after a peace of thirty-eight years. The\r\n      clergy, at that time, consisted of a bishop, forty-six\r\n      presbyters, seven deacons, as many sub-deacons, forty-two\r\n      acolytes, and fifty readers, exorcists, and porters. The number\r\n      of widows, of the infirm, and of the poor, who were maintained by\r\n      the oblations of the faithful, amounted to fifteen hundred. 169\r\n      From reason, as well as from the analogy of Antioch, we may\r\n      venture to estimate the Christians of Rome at about fifty\r\n      thousand. The populousness of that great capital cannot perhaps\r\n      be exactly ascertained; but the most modest calculation will not\r\n      surely reduce it lower than a million of inhabitants, of whom the\r\n      Christians might constitute at the most a twentieth part. 170\r\n\r\n      167 (return) [ Ingens multitudo is the expression of Tacitus, xv.\r\n      44.]\r\n\r\n      168 (return) [ T.

They were both unacquainted with the passage of\r\n      Chrysostom, which converts their conjecture almost into a fact.]\r\n\r\n      The western provincials appeared to have derived the knowledge of\r\n      Christianity from the same source which had diffused among them\r\n      the language, the sentiments, and the manners of Rome.\r\n\r\n      In this more important circumstance, Africa, as well as Gaul was\r\n      gradually fashioned to the imitation of the capital. Yet\r\n      notwithstanding the many favorable occasions which might invite\r\n      the Roman missionaries to visit their Latin provinces, it was\r\n      late before they passed either the sea or the Alps; 171 nor can\r\n      we discover in those great countries any assured traces either of\r\n      faith or of persecution that ascend higher than the reign of the\r\n      Antonines. 172 The slow progress of the gospel in the cold\r\n      climate of Gaul, was extremely different from the eagerness with\r\n      which it seems to have been received on the burning sands of\r\n      Africa. The African Christians soon formed one of the principal\r\n      members of the primitive church. The practice introduced into\r\n      that province of appointing bishops to the most inconsiderable\r\n      towns, and very frequently to the most obscure villages,\r\n      contributed to multiply the splendor and importance of their\r\n      religious societies, which during the course of the third century\r\n      were animated by the zeal of Tertullian, directed by the\r\n      abilities of Cyprian, and adorned by the eloquence of Lactantius.\r\n\r\n      But if, on the contrary, we turn our eyes towards Gaul, we must\r\n      content ourselves with discovering, in the time of Marcus\r\n      Antoninus, the feeble and united congregations of Lyons and\r\n      Vienna; and even as late as the reign of Decius we are assured,\r\n      that in a few cities only, Arles, Narbonne, Thoulouse, Limoges,\r\n      Clermont, Tours, and Paris, some scattered churches were\r\n      supported by the devotion of a small number of Christians. 173\r\n      Silence is indeed very consistent with devotion; but as it is\r\n      seldom compatible with zeal, we may perceive and lament the\r\n      languid state of Christianity in those provinces which had\r\n      exchanged the Celtic for the Latin tongue, since they did not,\r\n      during the three first centuries, give birth to a single\r\n      ecclesiastical writer. From Gaul, which claimed a just\r\n      preeminence of learning and authority over all the countries on\r\n      this side of the Alps, the light of the gospel was more faintly\r\n      reflected on the remote provinces of Spain and Britain; and if we\r\n      may credit the vehement assertions of Tertullian, they had\r\n      already received the first rays of the faith, when he addressed\r\n      his apology to the magistrates of the emperor Severus. 174 But\r\n      the obscure and imperfect origin of the western churches of\r\n      Europe has been so negligently recorded, that if we would relate\r\n      the time and manner of their foundation, we must supply the\r\n      silence of antiquity by those legends which avarice or\r\n      superstition long afterwards dictated to the monks in the lazy\r\n      gloom of their convents. 175 Of these holy romances, that of the\r\n      apostle St. James can alone, by its singular extravagance,\r\n      deserve to be mentioned. From a peaceful fisherman of the Lake of\r\n      Gennesareth, he was transformed into a valorous knight, who\r\n      charged at the head of the Spanish chivalry in their battles\r\n      against the Moors. The gravest historians have celebrated his\r\n      exploits; the miraculous shrine of Compostella displayed his\r\n      power; and the sword of a military order, assisted by the terrors\r\n      of the Inquisition, was sufficient to remove every objection of\r\n      profane criticism. 176\r\n\r\n      171 (return) [ Serius trans Alpes, religione Dei suscepta.\r\n      Sulpicius Severus, l. ii.

According to the\r\n      irreproachable testimony of Origen, 183 the proportion of the\r\n      faithful was very inconsiderable, when compared with the\r\n      multitude of an unbelieving world; but, as we are left without\r\n      any distinct information, it is impossible to determine, and it\r\n      is difficult even to conjecture, the real numbers of the\r\n      primitive Christians. The most favorable calculation, however,\r\n      that can be deduced from the examples of Antioch and of Rome,\r\n      will not permit us to imagine that more than a twentieth part of\r\n      the subjects of the empire had enlisted themselves under the\r\n      banner of the cross before the important conversion of\r\n      Constantine. But their habits of faith, of zeal, and of union,\r\n      seemed to multiply their numbers; and the same causes which\r\n      contributed to their future increase, served to render their\r\n      actual strength more apparent and more formidable.\r\n\r\n      183 (return) [Origen contra Celsum, l. viii. p. 424.]\r\n\r\n      Such is the constitution of civil society, that, whilst a few\r\n      persons are distinguished by riches, by honors, and by knowledge,\r\n      the body of the people is condemned to obscurity, ignorance and\r\n      poverty. The Christian religion, which addressed itself to the\r\n      whole human race, must consequently collect a far greater number\r\n      of proselytes from the lower than from the superior ranks of\r\n      life. This innocent and natural circumstance has been improved\r\n      into a very odious imputation, which seems to be less strenuously\r\n      denied by the apologists, than it is urged by the adversaries, of\r\n      the faith; that the new sect of Christians was almost entirely\r\n      composed of the dregs of the populace, of peasants and mechanics,\r\n      of boys and women, of beggars and slaves, the last of whom might\r\n      sometimes introduce the missionaries into the rich and noble\r\n      families to which they belonged. These obscure teachers (such was\r\n      the charge of malice and infidelity) are as mute in public as\r\n      they are loquacious and dogmatical in private.

As the humble faith of Christ\r\n      diffused itself through the world, it was embraced by several\r\n      persons who derived some consequence from the advantages of\r\n      nature or fortune. Aristides, who presented an eloquent apology\r\n      to the emperor Hadrian, was an Athenian philosopher. 185 Justin\r\n      Martyr had sought divine knowledge in the schools of Zeno, of\r\n      Aristotle, of Pythagoras, and of Plato, before he fortunately was\r\n      accosted by the old man, or rather the angel, who turned his\r\n      attention to the study of the Jewish prophets. 186 Clemens of\r\n      Alexandria had acquired much various reading in the Greek, and\r\n      Tertullian in the Latin, language. Julius Africanus and Origen\r\n      possessed a very considerable share of the learning of their\r\n      times; and although the style of Cyprian is very different from\r\n      that of Lactantius, we might almost discover that both those\r\n      writers had been public teachers of rhetoric. Even the study of\r\n      philosophy was at length introduced among the Christians, but it\r\n      was not always productive of the most salutary effects; knowledge\r\n      was as often the parent of heresy as of devotion, and the\r\n      description which was designed for the followers of Artemon, may,\r\n      with equal propriety, be applied to the various sects that\r\n      resisted the successors of the apostles. “They presume to alter\r\n      the Holy Scriptures, to abandon the ancient rule of faith, and to\r\n      form their opinions according to the subtile precepts of logic.\r\n      The science of the church is neglected for the study of geometry,\r\n      and they lose sight of heaven while they are employed in\r\n      measuring the earth.

Epist. 83.]\r\n\r\n      186 (return) [ The story is prettily told in Justin’s Dialogues.\r\n      Tillemont, (Mem Ecclesiast. tom. ii. p. 384,) who relates it\r\n      after him is sure that the old man was a disguised angel.]\r\n\r\n      187 (return) [ Eusebius, v. 28. It may be hoped, that none,\r\n      except the heretics, gave occasion to the complaint of Celsus,\r\n      (ap. Origen, l. ii. p. 77,) that the Christians were perpetually\r\n      correcting and altering their Gospels. * Note: Origen states in\r\n      reply, that he knows of none who had altered the Gospels except\r\n      the Marcionites, the Valentinians, and perhaps some followers of\r\n      Lucanus.—M.]\r\n\r\n      Nor can it be affirmed with truth, that the advantages of birth\r\n      and fortune were always separated from the profession of\r\n      Christianity. Several Roman citizens were brought before the\r\n      tribunal of Pliny, and he soon discovered, that a great number of\r\n      persons of _every order_ of men in Bithynia had deserted the\r\n      religion of their ancestors. 188 His unsuspected testimony may,\r\n      in this instance, obtain more credit than the bold challenge of\r\n      Tertullian, when he addresses himself to the fears as well as the\r\n      humanity of the proconsul of Africa, by assuring him, that if he\r\n      persists in his cruel intentions, he must decimate Carthage, and\r\n      that he will find among the guilty many persons of his own rank,\r\n      senators and matrons of noblest extraction, and the friends or\r\n      relations of his most intimate friends. 189 It appears, however,\r\n      that about forty years afterwards the emperor Valerian was\r\n      persuaded of the truth of this assertion, since in one of his\r\n      rescripts he evidently supposes that senators, Roman knights, and\r\n      ladies of quality, were engaged in the Christian sect. 190 The\r\n      church still continued to increase its outward splendor as it\r\n      lost its internal purity; and, in the reign of Diocletian, the\r\n      palace, the courts of justice, and even the army, concealed a\r\n      multitude of Christians, who endeavored to reconcile the\r\n      interests of the present with those of a future life.\r\n\r\n      188 (return) [ Plin. Epist. x. 97. Fuerunt alii similis amentiæ,\r\n      cives Romani—-Multi enim omnis ætatis, omnis ordinis, utriusque\r\n      sexus, etiam vocuntur in periculum et vocabuntur.]\r\n\r\n      189 (return) [ Tertullian ad Scapulum. Yet even his rhetoric\r\n      rises no higher than to claim a tenth part of Carthage.]\r\n\r\n      190 (return) [ Cyprian. Epist. 70.]\r\n\r\n      And yet these exceptions are either too few in number, or too\r\n      recent in time, entirely to remove the imputation of ignorance\r\n      and obscurity which has been so arrogantly cast on the first\r\n      proselytes of Christianity. 1901 Instead of employing in our\r\n      defence the fictions of later ages, it will be more prudent to\r\n      convert the occasion of scandal into a subject of edification.\r\n      Our serious thoughts will suggest to us, that the apostles\r\n      themselves were chosen by Providence among the fishermen of\r\n      Galilee, and that the lower we depress the temporal condition of\r\n      the first Christians, the more reason we shall find to admire\r\n      their merit and success. It is incumbent on us diligently to\r\n      remember, that the kingdom of heaven was promised to the poor in\r\n      spirit, and that minds afflicted by calamity and the contempt of\r\n      mankind, cheerfully listen to the divine promise of future\r\n      happiness; while, on the contrary, the fortunate are satisfied\r\n      with the possession of this world; and the wise abuse in doubt\r\n      and dispute their vain superiority of reason and knowledge.\r\n\r\n      1901 (return) [ This incomplete enumeration ought to be increased\r\n      by the names of several Pagans converted at the dawn of\r\n      Christianity, and whose conversion weakens the reproach which the\r\n      historian appears to support. Such are, the Proconsul Sergius\r\n      Paulus, converted at Paphos, (Acts xiii. 7—12.) Dionysius, member\r\n      of the Areopagus, converted with several others, al Athens, (Acts\r\n      xvii. 34;) several persons at the court of Nero, (Philip. iv 22;)\r\n      Erastus, receiver at Corinth, (Rom. xvi.23;) some Asiarchs, (Acts\r\n      xix. 31) As to the philosophers, we may add Tatian, Athenagoras,\r\n      Theophilus of Antioch, Hegesippus, Melito, Miltiades, Pantænus,\r\n      Ammenius, all distinguished for their genius and learning.—G.]\r\n\r\n      We stand in need of such reflections to comfort us for the loss\r\n      of some illustrious characters, which in our eyes might have\r\n      seemed the most worthy of the heavenly present. The names of\r\n      Seneca, of the elder and the younger Pliny, of Tacitus, of\r\n      Plutarch, of Galen, of the slave Epictetus, and of the emperor\r\n      Marcus Antoninus, adorn the age in which they flourished, and\r\n      exalt the dignity of human nature. They filled with glory their\r\n      respective stations, either in active or contemplative life;\r\n      their excellent understandings were improved by study; Philosophy\r\n      had purified their minds from the prejudices of the popular\r\n      superstitions; and their days were spent in the pursuit of truth\r\n      and the practice of virtue. Yet all these sages (it is no less an\r\n      object of surprise than of concern) overlooked or rejected the\r\n      perfection of the Christian system. Their language or their\r\n      silence equally discover their contempt for the growing sect,\r\n      which in their time had diffused itself over the Roman empire.\r\n      Those among them who condescended to mention the Christians,\r\n      consider them only as obstinate and perverse enthusiasts, who\r\n      exacted an implicit submission to their mysterious doctrines,\r\n      without being able to produce a single argument that could engage\r\n      the attention of men of sense and learning. 191\r\n\r\n      191 (return) [ Dr. Lardner, in his first and second volumes of\r\n      Jewish and Christian testimonies, collects and illustrates those\r\n      of Pliny the younger, of Tacitus, of Galen, of Marcus Antoninus,\r\n      and perhaps of Epictetus, (for it is doubtful whether that\r\n      philosopher means to speak of the Christians.) The new sect is\r\n      totally unnoticed by Seneca, the elder Pliny, and Plutarch.]\r\n\r\n      It is at least doubtful whether any of these philosophers perused\r\n      the apologies 1911 which the primitive Christians repeatedly\r\n      published in behalf of themselves and of their religion; but it\r\n      is much to be lamented that such a cause was not defended by\r\n      abler advocates. They expose with superfluous wit and eloquence\r\n      the extravagance of Polytheism. They interest our compassion by\r\n      displaying the innocence and sufferings of their injured\r\n      brethren. But when they would demonstrate the divine origin of\r\n      Christianity, they insist much more strongly on the predictions\r\n      which announced, than on the miracles which accompanied, the\r\n      appearance of the Messiah. Their favorite argument might serve to\r\n      edify a Christian or to convert a Jew, since both the one and the\r\n      other acknowledge the authority of those prophecies, and both are\r\n      obliged, with devout reverence, to search for their sense and\r\n      their accomplishment. But this mode of persuasion loses much of\r\n      its weight and influence, when it is addressed to those who\r\n      neither understand nor respect the Mosaic dispensation and the\r\n      prophetic style. 192 In the unskilful hands of Justin and of the\r\n      succeeding apologists, the sublime meaning of the Hebrew oracles\r\n      evaporates in distant types, affected conceits, and cold\r\n      allegories; and even their authenticity was rendered suspicious\r\n      to an unenlightened Gentile, by the mixture of pious forgeries,\r\n      which, under the names of Orpheus, Hermes, and the Sibyls, 193\r\n      were obtruded on him as of equal value with the genuine\r\n      inspirations of Heaven. The adoption of fraud and sophistry in\r\n      the defence of revelation too often reminds us of the injudicious\r\n      conduct of those poets who load their _invulnerable_ heroes with\r\n      a useless weight of cumbersome and brittle armor.\r\n\r\n      1911 (return) [ The emperors Hadrian, Antoninus &c., read with\r\n      astonishment the apologies of Justin Martyr, of Aristides, of\r\n      Melito, &c. (See St. Hieron. ad mag. orat. Orosius, lviii. c.\r\n      13.) Eusebius says expressly, that the cause of Christianity was\r\n      defended before the senate, in a very elegant discourse, by\r\n      Apollonius the Martyr.—G. ——Gibbon, in his severer spirit of\r\n      criticism, may have questioned the authority of Jerome and\r\n      Eusebius. There are some difficulties about Apollonius, which\r\n      Heinichen (note in loc. Eusebii) would solve, by suppose lag him\r\n      to have been, as Jerome states, a senator.—M.]\r\n\r\n      192 (return) [ If the famous prophecy of the Seventy Weeks had\r\n      been alleged to a Roman philosopher, would he not have replied in\r\n      the words of Cicero, “Quæ tandem ista auguratio est, annorum\r\n      potius quam aut rænsium aut dierum?” De Divinatione, ii. 30.\r\n      Observe with what irreverence Lucian, (in Alexandro, c. 13.) and\r\n      his friend Celsus ap. Origen, (l. vii. p. 327,) express\r\n      themselves concerning the Hebrew prophets.]\r\n\r\n      193 (return) [ The philosophers who derided the more ancient\r\n      predictions of the Sibyls, would easily have detected the Jewish\r\n      and Christian forgeries, which have been so triumphantly quoted\r\n      by the fathers, from Justin Martyr to Lactantius. When the\r\n      Sibylline verses had performed their appointed task, they, like\r\n      the system of the millennium, were quietly laid aside. The\r\n      Christian Sybil had unluckily fixed the ruin of Rome for the year\r\n      195, A. U. C. 948.]\r\n\r\n      But how shall we excuse the supine inattention of the Pagan and\r\n      philosophic world, to those evidences which were represented by\r\n      the hand of Omnipotence, not to their reason, but to their\r\n      senses? During the age of Christ, of his apostles, and of their\r\n      first disciples, the doctrine which they preached was confirmed\r\n      by innumerable prodigies. The lame walked, the blind saw, the\r\n      sick were healed, the dead were raised, dæmons were expelled, and\r\n      the laws of Nature were frequently suspended for the benefit of\r\n      the church. But the sages of Greece and Rome turned aside from\r\n      the awful spectacle, and, pursuing the ordinary occupations of\r\n      life and study, appeared unconscious of any alterations in the\r\n      moral or physical government of the world. Under the reign of\r\n      Tiberius, the whole earth, 194 or at least a celebrated province\r\n      of the Roman empire, 195 was involved in a preternatural darkness\r\n      of three hours. Even this miraculous event, which ought to have\r\n      excited the wonder, the curiosity, and the devotion of mankind,\r\n      passed without notice in an age of science and history. 196 It\r\n      happened during the lifetime of Seneca and the elder Pliny, who\r\n      must have experienced the immediate effects, or received the\r\n      earliest intelligence, of the prodigy. Each of these\r\n      philosophers, in a laborious work, has recorded all the great\r\n      phenomena of Nature, earthquakes, meteors, comets, and eclipses,\r\n      which his indefatigable curiosity could collect. 197 Both the one\r\n      and the other have omitted to mention the greatest phenomenon to\r\n      which the mortal eye has been witness since the creation of the\r\n      globe. A distinct chapter of Pliny 198 is designed for eclipses\r\n      of an extraordinary nature and unusual duration; but he contents\r\n      himself with describing the singular defect of light which\r\n      followed the murder of Cæsar, when, during the greatest part of a\r\n      year, the orb of the sun appeared pale and without splendor. The\r\n      season of obscurity, which cannot surely be compared with the\r\n      preternatural darkness of the Passion, had been already\r\n      celebrated by most of the poets 199 and historians of that\r\n      memorable age. 200\r\n\r\n      194 (return) [ The fathers, as they are drawn out in battle array\r\n      by Dom Calmet, (Dissertations sur la Bible, tom. iii. p.\r\n      295—308,) seem to cover the whole earth with darkness, in which\r\n      they are followed by most of the moderns.]\r\n\r\n      195 (return) [ Origen ad Matth. c. 27, and a few modern critics,\r\n      Beza, Le Clerc, Lardner, &c., are desirous of confining it to the\r\n      land of Judea.]\r\n\r\n      196 (return) [ The celebrated passage of Phlegon is now wisely\r\n      abandoned. When Tertullian assures the Pagans that the mention of\r\n      the prodigy is found in Arcanis (not Archivis) vestris, (see his\r\n      Apology, c. 21,) he probably appeals to the Sibylline verses,\r\n      which relate it exactly in the words of the Gospel. * Note:\r\n      According to some learned theologians a misunderstanding of the\r\n      text in the Gospel has given rise to this mistake, which has\r\n      employed and wearied so many laborious commentators, though\r\n      Origen had already taken the pains to preinform them. The\r\n      expression does not mean, they assert, an eclipse, but any kind\r\n      of obscurity occasioned in the atmosphere, whether by clouds or\r\n      any other cause. As this obscuration of the sun rarely took place\r\n      in Palestine, where in the middle of April the sky was usually\r\n      clear, it assumed, in the eyes of the Jews and Christians, an\r\n      importance conformable to the received notion, that the sun\r\n      concealed at midday was a sinister presage. See Amos viii. 9, 10.\r\n      The word is often taken in this sense by contemporary writers;\r\n      the Apocalypse says the sun was concealed, when speaking of an\r\n      obscuration caused by smoke and dust. (Revel. ix. 2.) Moreover,\r\n      the Hebrew word ophal, which in the LXX. answers to the Greek,\r\n      signifies any darkness; and the Evangelists, who have modelled\r\n      the sense of their expressions by those of the LXX., must have\r\n      taken it in the same latitude. This darkening of the sky usually\r\n      precedes earthquakes. (Matt. xxvii. 51.) The Heathen authors\r\n      furnish us a number of examples, of which a miraculous\r\n      explanation was given at the time. See Ovid. ii. v. 33, l. xv. v.\r\n      785. Pliny, Hist. Nat. l. ii. c 30. Wetstein has collected all\r\n      these examples in his edition of the New Testament. We need not,\r\n      then, be astonished at the silence of the Pagan authors\r\n      concerning a phenomenon which did not extend beyond Jerusalem,\r\n      and which might have nothing contrary to the laws of nature;\r\n      although the Christians and the Jews may have regarded it as a\r\n      sinister presage.
