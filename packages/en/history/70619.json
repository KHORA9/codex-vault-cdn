The genesis of it is as follows. When, not much less than\r\nthirty years ago, the writer was first asked to undertake the duty of a\r\ncritic, he had naturally to overhaul his own acquaintance with the\r\ntheory and practice of criticism, and to inquire what was the\r\nacquaintance of others therewith. The disconcerting smallness of the\r\nfirst was a little compensated by the discovery that very few persons\r\nseemed to be much better furnished. Dr Johnson’s projected “History of\r\nCriticism, as it relates to Judging of Authours” no doubt has had\r\nfellows in the great library of books unwritten. But there were then,\r\nand I believe there are still, only two actual attempts to deal with the\r\nwhole subject. One of these[1] I have never seen, and indeed had never\r\nheard of till nearly the whole of the present volume was written.\r\nMoreover, it seems to be merely a torso. The other, Théry’s _Histoire\r\ndes Opinions Littéraires_,[2] a book which, after two editions at some\r\ninterval, has been long out of print, is a work of great liveliness, no\r\nsmall knowledge, and, in its airy French kind, a good deal of acuteness.\r\nBut the way in which “Critique Arabe,” “Critique Juive,” &c., are\r\nknocked off in a page or a paragraph at one end, and the way in which,\r\nat the other—though the second edition was published when Mr Arnold was\r\njust going to write, and the first when Coleridge, and Hazlitt, and Lamb\r\nhad already written—the historian knows of nothing English later than\r\nCampbell and Blair, are things a little disquieting. At any rate,\r\nneither of these was then known to me, and I had, year by year, to pick\r\nup for myself, and piece together, the greater and lesser classics of\r\nthe subject in a haphazard and groping fashion.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Delia Critica, Libri Tre. B. Mazzarella, Geneva, 1866. The book to\r\n  which I owe my knowledge of this, Professors Gayley and Scott’s\r\n  _Introduction to the Methods and Materials of Literary Criticism_,\r\n  Boston, U.S.A., 1899, is invaluable as a bibliography, and has much\r\n  more than merely bibliographical interest.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Ed. 2, Paris, 1849. The first edition may have appeared between 1830\r\n  and 1840. Vapereau says 1844, which would strengthen my point in the\r\n  text; but this does not seem to agree with the Preface of the second.\r\n\r\nThis volume—which will, fortune permitting, be followed by a second\r\ndealing with the matter from the Renaissance to the death of\r\neighteenth-century Classicism, and by a third on Modern Criticism—is an\r\nattempt to supply for others, on the basis of these years of reading,\r\nthe Atlas of which the writer himself so sorely felt the need. He may\r\nhave put elephants for towns, he may have neglected important rivers and\r\nmountains, like a general from the point of view of a newspaper\r\ncorrespondent, or a newspaper correspondent from the point of view of a\r\ngeneral; but he has done what he could.\r\n\r\nThe book, the plan of which was accepted by my publishers some five or\r\nsix years ago, before I was appointed to the Chair which I have the\r\nhonour to hold, has been delayed in its composition, partly by work\r\npreviously undertaken, partly by professional duties. But it has\r\nprobably not been injured by the necessity of reading, for these duties,\r\nsome four or five times over again, the _Poetics_ and the _Rhetoric_,\r\nthe _Institutes_ and the Περὶ Ὕψους,, the _De Vulgari Eloquio_ and the\r\n_Discoveries_, the _Essay of Dramatic Poesy_ and the _Preface to Lyrical\r\nBallads_.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether some apology may be expected from a man whom\r\nreaders, if they know him at all, are likely to know only as a student\r\nof modern literature, for the presumption of making his own translations\r\nfrom Greek and Latin. But when one has learnt these languages for twelve\r\nor fifteen years, taught them for eight more, and read them for nearly\r\nanother five-and-twenty, it seems rather pusillanimous to take cover\r\nbehind “cribs.” I have aimed throughout rather at closeness than at\r\nelegance. An apology of another kind may be offered for the biographical\r\nand lexicographical details which, at the cost of some trouble, have\r\nbeen incorporated in the Index. Everybody has not a classical dictionary\r\nat hand, and probably few people have a full rhetorical lexicon. Yet it\r\nwas inevitable, in a book of this kind, that a large number of persons,\r\nbooks, and words should be introduced, as to the date, the contents, the\r\nmeaning of which or of whom, the ordinary reader might require some\r\nenlightenment. Information of the sort would have made the text\r\nindigestible and have overballasted the notes; so I have put it in the\r\nIndex, where those who do not want it need not seek it, and where those\r\nwho seek will, I hope, find.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to thank, with a heartiness not easily to be expressed,\r\nthe friends who have been good enough to read my proofs and to give me\r\nthe benefit of their special knowledge. Not always does the restless\r\nexplorer of literature at large who, knowing that here also “the merry\r\nworld is round And [he] may sail for evermore,” elects to be a\r\nworld-wanderer, receive, from the legitimate authorities of the ports\r\ninto which he puts, a genuine welcome, cheerful victualling, and\r\nassistance in visiting the adjacent provinces. Sometimes they fire into\r\nhim, sometimes they deny him food and water, often they look upon him as\r\na filibuster, or an interloper, or presumptuous. But Professor Butcher,\r\nProfessor Hardie, and Professor Ker, who have had the exceeding kindness\r\nto read each the portion of this volume which belongs to him more\r\nspecially of right, have not only given me invaluable suggestions and\r\ncorrections, but have even encouraged me to hope that my treatment,\r\nhowever far it may fall short of what is desirable, is not grossly and\r\nimpudently inadequate. May all other competent persons be equally\r\nlenient!\r\n\r\n                                                  GEORGE SAINTSBURY.\r\n\r\nEDINBURGH, _Lammastide 1900_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        NOTE TO SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\nSince this book was first printed, I have remembered that the story\r\nabout Malatesta and the bones (note, p. 124) is told by Mr Symonds in\r\nmore than one place (_e.g._, _The Revival of Learning_, new ed., p. 151)\r\nof _Gemistus_ Pletho, the well-known Grecian and Platonist, whose\r\nappearance in Italy so much excited Humanism. This is, for many reasons,\r\nmuch more probable; but the mistake of “Themistius,” if mistake it be,\r\nis not mine but Dindorf’s, or rather that of Keyssler, from whom Dindorf\r\nquotes an account of the matter, and an apparently literal transcript of\r\nthe inscription. Some minor emendations have been made in this edition,\r\nbut it has been thought better to place the major corrections of fact\r\nand explanations of meaning in the second volume, in order that all\r\npossessors of the book may be equally furnished with these.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK I.\r\n\r\n                            GREEK CRITICISM.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n                                                                 PAGE\r\n   Delimitation of frontier                                         3\r\n   Classes of Criticism excluded                                    4\r\n   Class retained                                                   4\r\n   Method                                                           4\r\n   Texts the chief object                                           5\r\n   _Hypotheses non fingo_                                           6\r\n\r\n   Illustration from M.

But if this is the case\r\ngenerally, it must be more especially the case where there is at least\r\nsome considerable danger of ambiguity. And that there is such danger, in\r\nregard to the title of the present book, not many persons, I suppose,\r\nwould think of denying. The word Criticism is often used, not merely\r\nwith the laxity common to all such terms, but in senses which are not so\r\nmuch extensions of each other as digressions into entirely different\r\n_genera_. In the following pages it will be used as nearly as possible\r\nunivocally. The Criticism which will be dealt with here is that function\r\nof the judgment which busies itself with the goodness or badness, the\r\nsuccess or ill-success, of literature from the purely literary point of\r\nview. Other offices of the critic, real or so-called, will occupy us\r\nslightly or not at all. We shall meddle little with the more\r\ntranscendental Æsthetic, with those ambitious theories of Beauty, and of\r\nartistic Pleasure in general, which, fascinating and noble as they\r\nappear, have too often proved cloud-Junos. The business of\r\ninterpretation, a most valuable and legitimate side-work of his, though\r\nperhaps only a side-work, will have to be glanced at, as we come to\r\nmodern times, with increasing frequency. We shall not be able entirely\r\nto leave out of the question, though we shall not greatly trouble\r\nourselves with it, what is called the “verbal” part of his office—the\r\nauthentication or extrusion of this or that “reading.” But we shall, as\r\nfar as possible, neglect and decline what may perhaps best be called the\r\nArt of Critical Coscinomancy, by which the critic affects to discern,\r\nseparate, and rearrange, on internal evidence not of a literary\r\ncharacter, the authorship and date of books. Of the Criticism,\r\nso-called, which has performed its chief exploits in Biblical\r\ndiscussion, which has meddled a good deal with the [Sidenote: Classes of\r\nCriticism excluded.] Classics, and which occupies, in regard to the\r\nolder and therefore more tempting documents of modern literature, a\r\nposition of activity midway between that exercised towards the sacred\r\nwritings and that exercised towards Greek and Roman authors, no word\r\nwill, except by some accidental necessity, be found in these pages. The\r\nrules and canons of this Criticism are different from, and in most cases\r\nantagonistic to, those of Criticism proper: its objects are entirely\r\ndistinct; and in particular it, for the most part if not wholly,\r\nneglects the laws of Logic. Now Criticism proper, which is but in part a\r\nlimitation, in part an extension, of Rhetoric, never parts company with\r\nRhetoric’s elder sister.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the Criticism or modified Rhetoric, of which this book\r\nattempts to give a history, is pretty much the same thing as the\r\nreasoned exercise of Literary Taste—the [Sidenote: _Class retained._]\r\nattempt, by examination of literature, to find out what it is that makes\r\nliterature pleasant, and therefore good—the discovery, classification,\r\nand as far as possible tracing to their sources, of the qualities of\r\npoetry and prose, of style and metre, the classification of literary\r\nkinds, the examination and “proving,” as arms are proved, of literary\r\nmeans and weapons, not neglecting the observation of literary fashions\r\nand the like. It will follow from this that the History must pursue the\r\nhumble _a posteriori_ method. Except on the rarest [Sidenote: _Method._]\r\noccasions, when it may be safe to generalise, it will confine itself\r\nwholly to the particular and the actual. We shall not busy ourselves\r\nwith what men ought to have admired, what they ought to have written,\r\nwhat they ought to have thought, but with what they did think, write,\r\nadmire. To some, no doubt, this will give an appearance of plodding, if\r\nnot of pusillanimity; but there may be others who will recognise in it,\r\nnot so much a great refusal, as an honest attempt to provide some sound\r\nand useful knowledge which does not exist in any accessible form,—to\r\nraise, by whatsoever humble drudgery, vantage-points from which more\r\naspiring persons than the writer may take Pisgah-sights, if they please,\r\nwithout fear of their support collapsing under them in the manner of a\r\ntub.\r\n\r\nIt has further seemed desirable, if not absolutely necessary for the\r\ncarrying out of this scheme, to confine ourselves mainly to the actual\r\ntexts. This is not, perhaps, a fashionable proceeding. Not what Plato\r\nsays, but what the latest [Sidenote: _Texts the chief object._]\r\ncommentator says about Plato—not what Chaucer says, but what the latest\r\nthesis-writer thinks about Chaucer—is supposed to be the qualifying\r\nstudy of the scholar. I am not able to share this conception of\r\nscholarship. When we have read and digested the whole of Plato, we may,\r\nif we like, turn to his latest German editor; when we have read and\r\ndigested the whole of Shakespeare, and of Shakespeare’s contemporaries,\r\nwe may, if we like, turn to Shakespearian biographers and commentators.\r\nBut this extension of inquiry, to apply a famous contrast, is\r\nfacultative, not necessary. At any rate, in the following pages it is\r\nproposed to set forth, and where necessary to discuss, what Plato,\r\nAristotle, Dionysius, Longinus, what Cicero and Quintilian, what Dante\r\nand Dryden, what Corneille and Coleridge, with many a lesser man\r\nbesides, have said about literature, noticing by the way what effect\r\nthese authorities have had on the general judgment, and what, as often\r\nhappens, the general judgment has for the time made up its mind to,\r\nwithout troubling itself about authorities. But we shall only\r\noccasionally busy ourselves with what others, not themselves critically\r\ngreat, have said about these great critics, and that from no arrogance,\r\nbut for two reasons of the most inoffensive character. In the first\r\nplace, there is no room to handle both text and margent, with the\r\nmargent’s margent _ad infinitum_. In the second, the handling of the\r\nmargent would distinctly obscure the orderly setting forth of the texts.\r\n\r\nYet, further, leave will be taken to neglect guesswork as [Sidenote:\r\n\"Hypotheses non fingo.\"] far as possible, and for the most part, if not\r\ninvariably, to refrain from building any hypotheses upon titles, casual\r\ncitations, or mere probabilities.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate what is meant, let us take a book which every one who\r\nmakes such an attempt as this must mention with the utmost gratitude and\r\nrespect, the admirable _Essai sur l'Histoire de la Critique chez les\r\nGrecs_[3] of the late M. Egger. That excellent scholar and most\r\nagreeable writer was perhaps as free from “hariolation” as any one who\r\nhas ever dealt with classical subjects; yet the first ninety pages of\r\nhis book are practically in the air. The judges of rhapsodical\r\ncompetitions were the first critics; the Homeric edition of Pisistratus\r\npresupposes and implies criticism, which is equally—which is even\r\nmore—presupposed and implied in the choragic system of Athens, whereby\r\nplots were chosen for performance; there are known to have been\r\nsuccessive and corrected versions of plays, from which the same\r\nconclusions may be drawn. We are told, and can readily believe, that the\r\nactors had their parts suited to them, and this means criticism. Nay,\r\nwas not the [Sidenote: _Illustration from M. Egger._] whole Comedy, the\r\nOld Comedy at least, a criticism, and often a purely literary one? Is\r\nnot the _Frogs_, in particular, a dramatised “review” of the most\r\nslashing kind? And have we not even the titles, at least, of regular\r\ntreatises, presumably critical, by Pratinas, by Lasus, by the great\r\nSophocles himself?\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Paris. Third Edition, #1887.\r\n\r\nNow all this is probable; nearly all of it is interesting, and some of\r\nit is, so far as it goes, certain. But then as a certainty it goes such\r\na very little way! M. Egger himself, with the frankness which the\r\nscholar ought to have, but has not always, admits the justice of the\r\nreproach of one of his critics, that part of it is conjecture. It would\r\nscarcely be harsh to say that all of it is, in so far as any solid\r\ninformation as to the critical habits of the Greeks is furnished by it.\r\nIn the pages that follow at least a steady effort will be made to\r\ndiscard the conjectural altogether, and to reduce even the amount of\r\nsuperstructure on [Sidenote: _The Documents._] second-hand foundations\r\nto the minimum. The extant written word, as it is the sole basis of all\r\nsound criticism in regard to particulars, so it is the only sound basis\r\nfor the history of Criticism in general. The enormous losses which we\r\nhave suffered in this department of Greek literature, and the scanty\r\nsupply which, except in the department of the Lower Rhetoric, seems to\r\nbe all that existed in Latin, may appear to make the effort to conduct\r\ninquiry in this way a rash or a barren one; but the present writer at\r\nleast is convinced that no effort can usefully be made in any other. And\r\nafter [Sidenote: _Greek._] all, though so much is lost, much remains. In\r\npoint of tendency we can ask for nothing better than Plato, provoking\r\nand elusive as he may seem in individual utterances; in point of\r\nparticular expression and indication of general lines, the _Rhetoric_\r\nand the _Poetics_ of Aristotle are admittedly priceless; and such\r\nwriters as Dionysius of Halicarnassus, as Plutarch, as Dion Chrysostom,\r\nas Lucian, and above all as Longinus, leave us very little reason to\r\ncomplain, even when we turn from the comparative scantiness of this\r\n_corpus_ to the comparative wealth of arid rhetorical term-splitting\r\nwhich still remains to us.\r\n\r\nNor is it at all probable that if we had more Latin literary criticism\r\nwe should be so very much better off. For, once more,[Sidenote:\r\n_Roman._] the existing work of such men as Cicero, Quintilian, Tacitus,\r\nand above all Horace, with the literary allusions of the later\r\nsatirists, not to mention for the present the gossip of Aulus Gellius\r\nand the like, gives more than sufficient “tell-tales.” We can see the\r\nnature and the limitations of Roman criticism in these as well as if\r\nthey filled a library.\r\n\r\nIn the great stretch of time—some thousand years—between the decadence\r\nof the pure Classics and the appearance of the [Sidenote: _Mediæval._]\r\nRenaissance it is not the loss but the absence of material that is the\r\ninconvenience, and this inconvenience is again tolerable. The opinions\r\nof the Dark and Early Middle Ages on the Classics themselves are only a\r\ncuriosity; for real criticism or matured judgment on existing work in\r\nthe vernacular they had little opportunity even in a single language,\r\nfor comparative work still less. Only the astonishing and strangely\r\nundervalued tractate of Dante remains to show us what might have been\r\ndone; the rest is curious merely.\r\n\r\nBut the Renaissance has no sooner come than our difficulties assume a\r\ndifferent form, and increase as we approach our [Sidenote: _Renaissance\r\nand Modern._] own times. It is now not deficiency but superabundance of\r\nmaterial that besets us; and if this work reaches its second volume, a\r\nrigid process of selection and of representative treatment will become\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nBut in this first the problem is how to extract from comparatively,\r\nthough not positively, scanty material a history that, without calling\r\nin guesswork to its assistance, shall present a fairly adequate account\r\nof the Higher Rhetoric and Poetic, the theory and practice of Literary\r\nCriticism and Taste, during ancient and during mediæval times. At\r\nintervals the narrative and examination will be interrupted for the\r\npurpose of giving summaries of a kind necessarily more temerarious and\r\nexperimental than the body of the book, but even here no attempt will be\r\nmade at hasty generalisation. Where the path has been so little trodden,\r\nthe loyal road-layer will content himself with making it straight and\r\nfirm, with fencing it from precipices, and ballasting it across morasses\r\nas well as he can, leaving others to stroll off on side-tracks to\r\nagreeable view-points, and to thread loops of cunning expatiation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, with special regard to this Book and the next, I would,\r\nvery modestly but very strenuously, deprecate a line of comment which is\r\nnot unusual from exclusively classical students, and which stigmatises\r\n“judging ancient literature from modern points of view.” Such a process\r\nis no doubt even more grossly wrong than that (not unknown) of judging\r\nmodern literature from ancient standpoints. But the true critic admits\r\nneither. He endeavours—a hard and ambitious task!—to extract from _all_\r\nliterature, ancient, mediæval, and modern, lessons of its universal\r\nqualities, which may enable him to see each period _sub specie\r\næternitatis_. And nothing less than this—with the Muses to help—is the\r\nadventure of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                   GREEK CRITICISM BEFORE ARISTOTLE.\r\n\r\nEARLIEST CRITICISM OF THE GREEKS—PROBABLY HOMERIC IN SUBJECT—PROBABLY\r\n    ALLEGORIC IN METHOD—XENOPHANES—PARMENIDES—EMPEDOCLES—DEMOCRITUS—THE\r\n    SOPHISTS: EARLIER—THE SOPHISTS: LATER—PLATO—HIS CROTCHETS—HIS\r\n    COMPENSATIONS—ARISTOPHANES—THE ‘FROGS’—OTHER CRITICISM IN\r\n    COMEDY—SIMYLUS(?)—ISOCRATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we have, putting aside Aristophanes, an almost utter dearth of\r\nactual texts before Plato, it is possible, without [Sidenote: _Earliest\r\ncriticism of the Greeks._] violating the principles laid down in the\r\nforegoing chapter, to discern some general currents, and a few\r\nindividual deliverances, of Greek criticism[4] in earlier ages. The\r\nearliest character of this criticism that we perceive is, as we should\r\nexpect, a tendency towards allegorical explanations of literature. And\r\nthe earliest subject of this that we discover is, again as we should\r\nexpect, the work attributed to Homer.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  I am not aware of any _complete_ treatment of the subject of Greek\r\n  criticism except that of M. Egger already cited, and, as part of a\r\n  still larger whole, that of M. Théry (see note on Preface). The German\r\n  handlings of the subject, as Professor Rhys Roberts (p. 259 of his ed.\r\n  of Longinus) remarks, seem all to be concerned with the philosophy of\r\n  æsthetic. If the work which Professor Roberts himself promises (ibid.,\r\n  p. ix.) had appeared, I should doubtless have had a most valuable\r\n  guide and controller in him.\r\n\r\nIf we had older and more certain testimony about the fact, and still\r\nmore about the exact character, of the [Sidenote: _Probably Homeric in\r\nsubject._] world-famous Pisistratean redaction of the Homeric and other\r\npoems, it would be necessary to reverse the order of this statement; and\r\neven as it is, the utmost critical caution may admit that it was\r\nprobably with Homer that Greek criticism began. We shall find nothing so\r\nconstantly borne out in the whole course of this history as the\r\nfact—self-evident, but constantly neglected in its consequences—that\r\ncriticism is a vine which must have its elm or other support to fasten\r\non. And putting aside all the endless and (from some points of view at\r\nleast) rather fruitless disputes about the age, the authorship, and so\r\nforth, of Homer, we know, from what is practically the unanimous and\r\nunintentional testimony of the whole of Greek literature, that “Homer”\r\nand the knowledge of Homer were anterior to almost all of it. And it was\r\nimpossible that a people so acute and so philosophically given as the\r\nGreeks should be soaked in Homer, almost to the same extent as that to\r\nwhich the English lower and middle classes of the seventeenth century\r\nwere soaked in the Bible, without being tempted to exercise their\r\ncritical faculties upon the poems. It was long, as we shall see, before\r\nthis exercise took the form of strictly literary criticism, of the\r\ncriticism which (with the provisos and limitations of the last chapter)\r\nwe call æsthetic. It was once said that the three functions of criticism\r\nin its widest sense are to interpret, to verify or sanction, and to\r\njudge, the last being its highest and purest office. [Sidenote:\r\n_Probably allegoric in method._] But the other two commend themselves\r\nperhaps more to the natural man—they certainly commended themselves more\r\nto the Greeks—and we should expect to find them, as we do find them,\r\nearlier practised. The Pisistratean redaction, if a fact (as in some\r\nform or other it pretty certainly was), is an enterprise both bold and\r\nearly in the one direction; there is no reason to doubt that many\r\nenterprises were made pretty early in the other; and not much to doubt\r\nthat most of these experiments in interpretation took the allegorical\r\nform.\r\n\r\nModern readers and modern critics have usually a certain dislike to\r\nAllegory, at least when she presents herself honestly and by her own\r\nname. Her government has no doubt at times been something despotic, and\r\nher votaries and partisans have at times been almost intolerably tedious\r\nand absurd. Yet in the finer sorts of literature, at any rate, the\r\napprehension of some sort of allegory, of some sort of double meaning,\r\nis almost a necessity. The student of any kind of poetry, and the\r\nstudent of the more imaginative prose, can never rest satisfied with the\r\nmere literal and grammatical sense, which belongs not to literature but\r\nto science. He cannot help seeking some hidden meaning, something\r\nfurther, something behind, if it be only rhythmical beauty, only the\r\nsuggestion of pleasure to the ear and eye and heart. Nor ought he to\r\nhelp it. But the ill repute of Allegory arises from the ease with which\r\nher aid is borrowed to foist religious, philosophical, and other sermons\r\ninto the paradise of art. This danger was especially imminent in a\r\ncountry like Greece, where religion, philosophy, literature, and art of\r\nall kinds were, from the earliest times, almost inextricably connected\r\nand blended.\r\n\r\nAccordingly allegory, and that reverse or seamy side of allegory,\r\nrationalistic interpretation, seem to have made their appearance very\r\nearly in Greece. This latter has only to do with literary criticism in\r\nthe sense that it is, and always has been, a very great degrader\r\nthereof, inclining it to be busy with matter instead of form. The\r\nallegorising tendency proper is not quite so dangerous, though still\r\ndangerous enough. But in the second-hand and all too scanty notices that\r\nwe have of the early philosophers, it is evident that the two tendencies\r\nmet and crossed in them almost bewilderingly. When Xenophanes found\r\nfault with the Homeric anthropomorphism, when Anaxagoras and others made\r\nthe scarcely audacious identification of the arrows of Apollo with the\r\nrays of the sun, and the bolder one of Penelope’s web with the processes\r\nof the syllogism, they were anticipating a great deal which has\r\npresented itself as criticism (whether it had any business to do so or\r\nnot) in the last two thousand and odd hundred years. We have not a few\r\nnames, given by more or less good authority and less or more known\r\nindependently, of persons—Anaximander, Stesimbrotus, a certain Glaucus\r\nor Glaucon, and others—who early devoted themselves to allegorical\r\ninterpretation of Homer and perhaps of other poets; but we have hardly\r\neven fragments of their work, and we can found no solid arguments upon\r\nwhat is told us of it. Only we can see dimly from these notices, clearly\r\nfrom the fuller and now trustworthy evidence which we find in Plato,\r\nthat their criticism was criticism of matter only,—that they treated\r\nHomer as a historical, a religious, a philosophical document, not as a\r\nwork of art.\r\n\r\nIndeed, as one turns over the volumes of Karsten[5] and Mullach[6] with\r\ntheir budgets of commentary and scholia enveloping the scanty kernel of\r\ntext; as one reads the [Sidenote: _Xenophanes._] relics, so interesting,\r\nso tantalising, so pathetic, of these early thinkers who already knew of\r\nmetaphysics _ce qu’on a su de tous les temps_,—one sees, scanty as they\r\nare, how very unlikely it is that, if we had more, there would be\r\nanything in it that would serve our present purpose. These Greeks, at\r\nany rate, _were_ children—children of genius, children of extraordinary\r\npromise, children almost of that gigantic breed which has to be stifled\r\nlest it grow too fast. But, like children in general, when they have any\r\ngreat mental development, they scorned what seemed to them little\r\nthings. And, also like children, they had not and could not have the\r\naccumulation of knowledge of particulars which is necessary for the\r\ncriticism of art. The audacious monopantheism of Xenophanes could not,\r\nwe are sure, have stooped to consider, not as it actually did[7] whether\r\nHomer and Hesiod were blasphemers, but whether they did their\r\nblaspheming with technical cunning. In its sublimer moments and in its\r\nmoments of discussion, in those of the famous single line—\r\n\r\n             οὖλος ὁρᾷ, οὖλος δὲ νοεῖ, οὖλος δέ τ᾿ ἀκούει,\r\n\r\nas well as in the satire on the ox- and lion-creed of lions and oxen, it\r\nwould have equally scorned the attempt to substitute for mere opinion a\r\nhumble inductive approach to knowledge on the differences of Poetry and\r\nprose and the proper definition of Comedy. Even in those milder moods\r\nwhen the philosopher gave, if he did give, receipts for the proper mode\r\nof mixing negus,[8] and was not insensible to the charms of a soft\r\ncouch, sweet wine, and devilled peas,[9] one somehow does not see him as\r\na critic.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  _Philosophorum Græcorum Veterum Reliquiæ.

In the much earlier day of Parmenides not even this\r\nblend was to be expected. There could hardly by any possibility have\r\nbeen anything but the indulgence in allegorising which is equally dear\r\nto poets and philosophers, and perhaps the inception of a fanciful\r\nphilology. Metaphysics and physics sufficed, with a little creative\r\nliterature. For criticism there could be no room.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  Parm. _de Natura_, l. 11; Karsten, I. ii. 29.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., l. 35.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., l. 144.\r\n\r\nBut it will be said, Empedocles? Empedocles who, according to some\r\ntraditions, was the inventor of Rhetoric—who certainly was a native of\r\nthe island where Rhetoric arose—the [Sidenote: _Empedocles._] chief\r\nspeaker among these old philosophers? That Empedocles had a good deal of\r\nthe critical temper may be readily granted. He has little or nothing of\r\nthe sublime beliefs of Parmenides; his scepticism is much more\r\nthorough-going than that which certainly does appear in the philosopher\r\nof Colophon. If a man do not take the discouragement of it too much to\r\nheart there is, perhaps, no safer and saner frame of mind for the critic\r\nthan that expressed in the strongest of all the Empedoclean fragments,\r\nthat which tells us how “Men, wrestling through a little space of life\r\nthat is no life, whirled off like a vapour by quick fate, flit away,\r\neach persuaded but of that with which he has himself come in contact,\r\ndarting this way and that. But the Whole man boasts to find idly; not to\r\nbe seen are these things by men, nor heard, nor grasped by their minds.\r\nThou shalt know no more than human counsel has reached.”[13] An\r\nexcellent critical mood, if not pushed to mere inaction and despair: but\r\nthere is no evidence that it led Empedocles to criticism. Physics and\r\nethics appear to have absorbed him wholly.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  Emp. _de Natura_ l. 34-40; Karsten, ii. 89, 90.\r\n\r\nThat the sophist was the first rhetorician would be allowed by his\r\naccusers as well as by his apologists: and though Rhetoric long followed\r\nwandering fires before it recognised its true star and became Literary\r\nCriticism, yet nobody doubts that we must look to it for what literary\r\ncriticism we shall find in these times. The Sophists, on the very face\r\nof the charge constantly brought against them of attending to words\r\nmerely, are almost acknowledged to be the inventors of Grammar; while\r\nfrom the other charge that they corrupted youth by teaching them to talk\r\nfluently, to make the worse the better reason, and the like, it will\r\nequally follow that they practised the deliberate consideration of\r\nstyle. Grammar is only the _ancilla_ of criticism, but a tolerably\r\nindispensable one; the consideration of style is at least half of\r\ncriticism itself. Accordingly the two first persons in whose work (if we\r\nhad it) we might expect to find a considerable body of literary\r\ncriticism, if only literary criticism of a scrappy, tentative, and\r\noutside kind, are the two great sophists Gorgias and Protagoras,\r\ncontemporaries, but representatives of almost the two extremities of the\r\nlittle Greek world, of Leontini and Abdera, of Sicily and Thrace.\r\n\r\nWe have indeed a whole catalogue of work that should have been critical\r\nor nothing ascribed by Diogenes Laertius[14] to the still greater\r\ncontemporary and compatriot of Protagoras, Democritus. How happily would\r\nthe days of Thalaba (supposing Thalaba to be a historian of criticism)\r\ngo by, if he had that little library of works which Diogenes thus\r\nassigns and calls \"Of _Music_\"! They are eight in number: “On Rhythm and\r\nHarmony,” “On Poetry” (one would compound for this alone), “On the\r\nBeauty of Words,”[15] “On Well- and Ill-sounding Letters,” “On Homer or\r\nRight Style and Glosses,”[16] “On the Aoedic Art,” “On Verbs(?),”[17]\r\nand an _Onomasticon_. But Democritus lived in the fifth [Sidenote:\r\n_Democritus._] century before Christ, and Diogenes in the second century\r\nafter Christ; the historian’s attribution is unsupported, and he has no\r\ngreat character for accuracy; while, worst of all, he himself tells us\r\nthat there were six Democriti, and that of the other five one was a\r\nmusician, another an epigrammatist, and a third (most suspiciously) a\r\ntechnical writer on rhetoric. It stands fatally to reason that as all\r\nthese (save the Chian musician) seem to have been more modern, and as\r\nthe works mentioned would exactly fall in with the business of the\r\nmusician and the teacher of rhetoric, they are far more likely, if they\r\never existed (and Diogenes seems to cite rather the catalogue of a\r\ncertain Thrasylus than the books themselves), _not_ to have been the\r\nwork of the Laughing Philosopher. At any rate, even if they were, we are\r\nutterly ignorant of their tenor.\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  Diog. Laert., ix. 7, p. 239 ed. Cobet (Didot Collection).\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  ἐπέων. It is very difficult to be certain whether this means here\r\n  “word,” “song,” or “epic.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  ὀρθοεπείης καὶ γλωσσέων.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  ῥημάτων\r\n\r\nThat the other great Abderite, Protagoras, the disciple of Democritus\r\nhimself, wrote on subjects of the kind, there can be no reasonable\r\ndoubt. It is practically impossible that he should not have done so,\r\nthough we have not the exact title of any. He is said to have been the\r\nfirst to distinguish the parts of an oration by name, to have made some\r\nimportant advances in technical grammar, and to have lectured on the\r\npoets. But here again we have no texts to appeal to, nor any certain\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nYet perhaps it is not mere critical whim to doubt whether, if we had\r\nthese texts also, we should be much further advanced. The titles of\r\nthose attributed to Democritus, if we could accept [Sidenote: _The\r\nSophists—earlier._] the attribution with any confidence, would make such\r\nscepticism futile. But we have no titles of critical works attributed to\r\nProtagoras; we only know vaguely that he lectured on the poets.[18] And\r\nfrom all the stories about him as well as from the famous dialogue which\r\nputs the hostile view of his sophistry, we can conclude with tolerable\r\ncertainty that his interests were mainly ethical, with perhaps a dash of\r\ngrammar—the two notes, as we have seen and shall see, of all this early\r\nGreek criticism. Certainly this was the case with the Sicilian school\r\nwhich traditionally founded Rhetoric—Empedocles himself perhaps, Corax,\r\nTisias, Gorgias, and the pupil of Gorgias, Polus, with more certainty.\r\nHere again most of our best evidence is hostile, and therefore to be\r\nused with caution; but the hostility does not affect the present point.\r\nSocrates or Plato could have put unfavourable views of Sophistic quite\r\nas well—indeed, considering Plato’s curious notions of inventive art,\r\nperhaps better—in regard to Æsthetics. If ethics and philology, not\r\ncriticism proper, are the subjects in which their adversaries try to\r\nmake Protagoras and Gorgias cut a bad figure, we may be perfectly\r\ncertain that these were the subjects in which they themselves tried to\r\ncut a good one. If they are not misrepresented—are not indeed\r\nrepresented at all—in the strict character of the critic, it can only be\r\nbecause they did not, for good or for ill, assume that character. The\r\nphilosophy of language, the theory of persuasion, the moral character of\r\npoetry and oratory, these were the subjects which interested them and\r\ntheir hearers; not the sources of literary beauty, the division of\r\nliterary kinds, the nature and varieties of style. Wherever ethic and\r\nmetaphysic are left, the merest philology seems to have been the only\r\nalternative—the few phrases attributed to any writers of this period\r\nthat bear a different complexion being _very_ few, uncertainly\r\nauthentic, and in almost every case extremely vague.\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  And the authority for this, Themistius, is very late. The catalogue of\r\n  the works given by Diogenes Laertius (ed. cit., p. 240) includes\r\n  nothing even distantly bearing on criticism.\r\n\r\nNothing else could reasonably be expected when we consider the nature of\r\nRhetoric as we find it exhibited in Aristotle himself, and as it was\r\ncertainly conceived by its first inventors or nomenclators. It was the\r\nArt of Persuasion—the Art of producing a practical effect—almost the Art\r\nof Succeeding in Life. We shall see when we come to Aristotle himself\r\nthat this was as inevitable _a priori_ as it is certain in fact: for the\r\npresent the certainty of the fact itself may content us. Where the few\r\nrecorded or imputed utterances of the later sophists do touch on\r\nliterature they bear (with a certain additional ingenious wire-drawing)\r\nthe same marks as those of the early philosophers. [Sidenote: _The\r\nSophists—later._] They play upon the “honourable deceit” of tragedy;[19]\r\nthey tread harder the old road of allegorical interpretations;[20] they\r\ndwell on words and their nature;[21] or else, overshooting mark as far\r\nas elsewhere they fall short of it, they attempt ambitious theories of\r\nbeauty in general, whether it is “harmony,” utility, sensual pleasure,\r\nwhat not.[22] This is—to adopt the useful, if accidental, antithesis of\r\nmetaphysic—metacritic, not criticism. And we shall not, I think, be rash\r\nin assuming that if we had the texts, which we have not, we should\r\nfind—we are most certainly not rash in saying that in the actual texts\r\nwe do find—nothing but excursions in the vestibules of Criticism proper,\r\nor attempts more or less in vain upon her secret chambers,—no\r\nexpatiation whatever in her main and open halls.[23]\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  Gorgias ap. Plutarch.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  Prodicus in the “Choice of Hercules.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  V. the _Cratylus_, _passim_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  V. _Hippias Minor_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  There is not the slightest evidence for assigning the _Rhetoric_\r\n  called _ad Alexandrum_, and variously attributed to Aristotle and\r\n  Anaximenes, to any pre-Aristotelian writer, least of all for giving it\r\n  to Corax himself.\r\n\r\nTwo only, and those two of the very greatest, of Greek writers before\r\nAristotle—Plato and Aristophanes—furnish us with literary criticism\r\nproper, while of these two the first is a critic almost against his\r\nwill, and the second one merely for the nonce. Yet we may be more than\r\nthankful for what they give us, and for the slight reinforcement, as\r\nregards the nature of pre-Aristotelian criticism, which we derive from a\r\nthird and much lesser man—Isocrates.\r\n\r\nIt could not possibly be but that so great a writer as Plato, with an\r\n_ethos_ so philosophical as his, should display a strong [Sidenote:\r\n_Plato._] critical element. Yet there were in him other elements and\r\ntendencies, which repressed and distorted his criticism. To begin with,\r\nthough he less often lingered in the vestibule than his enemies the\r\nsophists, he was by the whole tendency of his philosophy even more\r\nprompted than they were to make straight for the adytum, neglecting the\r\nmain temple. Some form of the Ideal Theory is indeed necessary to the\r\ncritic: the beauty of literature is hardly accessible, except to one who\r\nis more or less a Platonist. No system so well accounts for the\r\nineffable poetic pleasure, the sudden “gustation of God” which poetry\r\ngives, as that of an archetypal form of every possible thought and\r\npassion, as well as person and thing, to which as the poet approaches\r\ncloser and closer, so he gives his readers the deeper and truer thrill.\r\nBut Plato’s unfortunate impatience of anything but the idea pure and\r\nsimple, led him all wrong in criticism. Instead of welcoming poetry for\r\nbringing him nearer to the impossible and unattainable, he chides it for\r\ninterfering with possession and attainment. In the _Phædrus_ and the\r\n_Republic_ especially, but also elsewhere, poetic genius, poetic charm,\r\npoetry itself, are described, if not exactly defined, with an accuracy\r\nwhich had never been reached before, and which has never been surpassed\r\nsince; in the same and other places the theory of Imitation, or, as it\r\nmight be much better called, Representation, is outlined with singular\r\nacuteness and, so far as we know, originality, though it is pushed too\r\nfar; and remarks on the divisions of literature, at least of poetry,\r\nshow that a critic of the highest order is but a little way off. But\r\nthen comes that everlasting ethical and political preoccupation which is\r\nat once the real forte and the real foible of the Greek genius, and\r\n(with some other peculiarities) succeeds to a great extent in\r\nneutralising the philosopher’s critical position as a whole. In the\r\nfirst place, the “imitation” theory (imperfectly grasped owing to causes\r\nto be more fully dealt with later) deposes the poet from his proper\r\nposition, and, combined with will-worship of the Idea, prevents Plato\r\nfrom seeing that the poet’s duty, his privilege, his real reason for\r\nexistence, is to “_dis_-realise,” to give us things not as they are but\r\nas they are not. In the second, that curious, interesting, and in part\r\nmost fruitful and valuable Manichæism which Idealism so often comports,\r\nmakes him gradually [Sidenote: _His crotchets._] look more and more down\r\non Art as Art, more and more take imagination and invention as sinful\r\nhuman interferences with “reminiscence,” and the simple acceptance of\r\nthe Divine. In the third place, the heresy of instruction grows on him,\r\nand makes him constantly look, not at the intrinsic value of poetry, its\r\nconnection with beauty, its importance to the free adult human spirit,\r\nbut at its position in reference to the young, the private citizen, and\r\nso forth. These things sufficiently account for the at first sight\r\nalmost unintelligible, though exquisitely put, caprices of the\r\n_Republic_ and the _Laws_, which at their worst represent the man of\r\nletters and the man of art generally as a dangerous and anti-social\r\nnuisance, at the very best admit him as a sort of Board-Schoolmaster, to\r\nbe rigidly kept in his place, and to be well inspected, coded, furnished\r\nwith schedules and rules of behaviour, in order that he may not step out\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nEven here, as always, there is some excuse for the choice _cum Platone\r\nerrare_, not merely in the exquisiteness of the literary form which this\r\nunworthy view of literature takes, but in the fact that, as usual, Plato\r\ncould not go wrong without going also right. He had probably seen in\r\nAthenian life, and he had certainly anticipated in his instinctive\r\ncommand of human nature, the complementary error and curse of “Art for\r\nArt only”—of the doctrine (itself, like his own, partly true, but, like\r\nhis own also, partly false and mischievous) of the moral\r\nirresponsibility of the artist. And looking first at morals and politics\r\nwith that almost feverish eagerness of the Greek philosopher, which was\r\nin great part justified by the subsequent Greek collapse in both, he\r\nshot wide of the bow-hand from the purely critical point of aim.\r\n\r\nYet where shall we find earlier in time, where shall we find nobler in\r\ntone at any time, a critical position to match with that of the\r\n_Phædrus_ and the _Ion_ as wholes, and of [Sidenote: _His\r\ncompensations._] many other passages? That “light and winged and sacred\r\nthing the poet” had never had his highest functions so celebrated\r\nbefore, though in the very passage which so celebrates him the\r\nantithesis of art and delirium be dangerously over-worked. Alas! it is\r\nin the power of all of us to avoid bad art, and it is not in the power\r\nof us all to secure good delirium! But this matters little, or at worst\r\nnot so very much. No one can acknowledge more heartily than Plato—no one\r\nhas acknowledged more poetically—that the poet is not a mere moralist, a\r\nmere imitator, a mere handler of important subjects. And from no one,\r\nconsidering his other views, could the acknowledgment come with greater\r\nforce and greater authority. In him and in that great enemy of his\r\nmaster, to whom we come next, we find first expressed that real\r\nenthusiasm for literature of which the best, the only true, criticism is\r\nbut a reasoned variety.\r\n\r\nIf we but possessed that ode or pæan of Tynnichus[24] of Chalcis, which,\r\nit would appear from the _Ion_,[25] Plato not merely thought the only\r\ngood thing among its author’s works, but regarded as a masterpiece in\r\nitself! If we could but ourselves compare the works of Antimachus with\r\nthose of the more popular Chœrilus, to which Plato himself is said to\r\nhave so much preferred them that he sent to Colophon to have a copy made\r\nfor his own use! Then we might know what his real literary preferences\r\nin the way of poetry were, instead of being put off with beautiful,\r\ninvaluable, but hopelessly vague enthusiasms about poetic beauty in the\r\nabstract, and with elaborate polemics against Homer and Hesiod from a\r\npoint of view which is not the point of view of literary criticism at\r\nall. But these things have been grudged us. There are assertions, which\r\nwe would not only fain believe, but have no difficulty whatever in\r\nbelieving, that the aversion to poets represented in the _Republic_ and\r\nthe _Laws_ was, if not feigned, hypothetical and, as one may say,\r\nprofessional. But this, though a comfort generally, is of no assistance\r\nto us in our present inquiry. The old comparison of the lantern “high,\r\nfar-shining, _empty_” recurs depressingly.[26]\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  Not only have we not this: we have practically nothing of Tynnichus.\r\n  His page in Bergk (iii. 379) is blank, except for the phrase which\r\n  Plato himself quotes: εὕρημά τι Μοισᾶν—“a windfall of the Muses.” Of a\r\n  very commonplace distich about Agamemnon’s ship, quoted by Procopius,\r\n  we may apparently relieve him.\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  534 D.\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  If the space and treatment here allotted to Plato seem exceeding poor\r\n  and beggarly, it can but be urged that his own criticism of literature\r\n  is so exceedingly _general_ that in this book no other treatment of it\r\n  was possible. On his own principles we should be “praising the horse\r\n  in terms of the ass” if we did otherwise. It is true that besides the\r\n  _attitude_ above extolled, there are to be found, from the glancing,\r\n  many-sided, parabolic discourse of the _Phædrus_ to the mighty theory\r\n  of the _Republic_, endless things invaluable, nay, indispensable, to\r\n  the critic. It is nearly certain that, as Professor Butcher thinks, no\r\n  one had anticipated him in the recognition of the organic unity\r\n  necessary to a work of literary, as of all, art. But even here, as in\r\n  the messages “to Lysias and all others who write orations, to Homer\r\n  and all others who write poems, to Solon, &c.,” we see the generality,\r\n  the abstraction, the evasiveness, one may almost say, of his critical\r\n  gospel. Such concrete things as the reference to Isocrates at the end\r\n  of the _Phædrus_ are very rare; and, on the other hand, his frequent\r\n  and full dealings with Homer are not literary criticism at all. In a\r\n  treatise on Æsthetics Plato cannot have too large a space; in a\r\n  History of Criticism the place allotted to him must be conspicuous,\r\n  but the space small.\r\n\r\nThere have been periods, not the happiest, but also not the least\r\nimportant of her history, when Criticism herself would have absolutely\r\nfenced her table against Aristophanes. [Sidenote: _Aristophanes._] That\r\na poet, and a dramatic poet, and a dramatic poet who permitted himself\r\nthe wildest excesses of farce, should be dignified with the name of\r\ncritic, would have seemed to the straiter sect a monstrous thing. Yet\r\nthe Old Greek Comedy was emphatically “a criticism of life,” and as such\r\nit could not fail to meddle with such an important part of Athenian life\r\nas Athenian literature. It might be not uninteresting, but is at best\r\nsuperfluous, if not positively irrelevant here, to point out how\r\nimportant that part was; the fact is certain. And while it is going\r\nrather a long way round to connect the rivalries of serious poets, and\r\nthe alterations which these or other causes brought about in their\r\nworks, with the history of criticism proper, there is no doubt of such a\r\nconnection in the case of the work—fortunately in fairly large measure\r\npreserved—of Aristophanes, and with that—unfortunately lost, except in\r\nfragments—of his fellows.\r\n\r\nNor can there be very much doubt that, though our possessions might be\r\ngreater in volume, we could hardly have anything better in kind than the\r\nwork of Aristophanes, and especially the famous play of the _Frogs_,\r\nwhich was probably the earliest of all the masterpieces of hostile\r\nliterary criticism, and which remains to this day among the very finest\r\nof them. Aristophanes indeed united, both generally and in this\r\nparticular instance, all the requisites for playing the part to\r\nperfection, with one single exception—the possession, namely, of that\r\nwide comparative knowledge of other literatures which the Greeks lacked,\r\nand which, in this as in other matters, was their most serious\r\ndeficiency. His own literary faculty was of the most exquisite as well\r\nas of the most vigorous kind. His possession, not merely of wit but of\r\nhumour in the highest degree, saved him from one of the commonest and\r\nthe greatest dangers of criticism—the danger of dwelling too long on\r\nsingle points, or of giving disproportionate attention to the different\r\npoints with which he dealt. And though no doubt the making a dead-set at\r\nbad or faulty literature, not because it is bad or faulty, but because\r\nit happens to be made the vehicle of views in politics, religion, or\r\nwhat not which the critic dislikes, is not theoretically defensible; yet\r\nthe historian and the practical philosopher must admit that, as a matter\r\nof fact, it has given us some of the very best criticism we have.\r\n\r\nNor has it given us anything much better than the _Frogs_. That the\r\npolemic against Euripides, here and elsewhere, is unfairly [Sidenote:\r\n_The_ Frogs.] and excessively personal, is not to be denied; and even\r\nthose who almost wholly agree with it from the literary side may grant\r\nthat it admits, here and there, of an answer. But still as criticism it\r\nis both _magnifique_ and also _la guerre_. The critic is no desultory\r\nsnarler, unprovided with theory, and simply snapping at the heels of\r\nsome one he dislikes. His twenty years' campaign against the author of\r\nthe _Medea_, from the _Acharnians_ to the _Frogs_ itself, is thoroughly\r\nconsistent: it rests upon a reasoned view of art and taste as well as of\r\npolitics and religion. He disapproves the sceptical purpose, the\r\ninsidious sophistic, the morbid passion of his victim; but he\r\ndisapproves quite as strongly the tedious preliminary explanations and\r\ninterpolated narratives, the “precious” sentiment and style, the tricks\r\nand the trivialities. And let it be observed also that Aristophanes,\r\nfanatic as he is, and rightly is, on the Æschylean side, is far too good\r\na critic and far too shrewd a man not to allow a pretty full view of the\r\nÆschylean defects, as well as to put in the mouth of Euripides himself a\r\nvery fairly strong defence of his own merits. The famous debate between\r\nthe two poets, with the accompanying observations of Dionysus and the\r\nChorus, could be thrown, with the least possible difficulty, into the\r\nform of a critical _causerie_ which would anticipate by two thousand\r\nyears and more the very shrewdest work of Dryden, the most thoughtful of\r\nColeridge, the most delicate and ingenious of Arnold and Sainte-Beuve.\r\nIt is indeed rather remarkable how easily literary criticism lends\r\nitself to the dramatic-poetical form, whether the ease be owing to the\r\nfact of this early and consummate example of it, or to some other cause.\r\nAnd what is especially noticeable is that, throughout, the censure goes\r\ndocuments in hand. The vague generalities of the _Poetics_ in verse, in\r\nwhich, after Horace and Vida, the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\r\ndelighted, are here eschewed in favour of direct criticism of actual\r\ntexts. One might call the _Frogs_, borrowing the phrase from mediæval\r\nFrench, a review _par personnages_, and a review of the closest, the\r\nmost stringent, and the most effective. We can indeed only be surprised\r\nthat with such an example as this, and others not far inferior, in the\r\nsame dramatist if not in others, formal criticism in prose should have\r\nbeen so long in making its appearance, and when it appeared, should have\r\nshown so much less mastery of method. Beside Aristophanes, the pure\r\ncritical reviewing of Aristotle himself is vague, is desultory, and\r\nbegins at the wrong end; even that of Longinus is scrappy and lacking in\r\ngrasp; while it would be as unfair as it would be unkind to mention, in\r\nany comparison of genius with the author of the _Frogs_, the one master\r\nof something like formal critical examination of particular books and\r\nauthors that Greek preserves for us in Dionysius of Halicarnassus.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, extremely rash to conclude, as has sometimes been\r\nconcluded, that because we find so much tendency towards [Sidenote:\r\n_Other criticism in Comedy._] literary criticism in Aristophanes, we\r\nshould find a proportionate amount in other Comic writers (at least in\r\nthose of the Old Comedy, who had perhaps most genius and certainly most\r\n_parrhesia_), if their works existed. The contrary opinion is far more\r\nprobable. For though we have nothing but fragments, often insignificant\r\nin individual bulk, of the writers of the Old Comedy except\r\nAristophanes, and of all the writers of the Middle—nothing but\r\nfragments, though sometimes not insufficient in bulk, of Menander,\r\nPhilemon, and the other writers of the New—yet it must be remembered\r\nthat these fragments are extremely numerous, and that in a very\r\nconsiderable number of cases, fragments as they are, they give a fair\r\nglimpse of context and general tone. I do not hesitate to say, after\r\nmost careful examination of the collections of Meineke and his\r\nsuccessors, that there are not more than one or two faint and doubtful\r\napproaches to our subject discoverable there. The passage of\r\nPherecrates[27] on which M. Egger chiefly relies to prove his very wide\r\nassertion that “il n’y a peut-être pas un seul poète” of the Old Comedy\r\n“qui n’ait mêlé la critique littéraire à ses fictions comiques” deals\r\nwith music, not literature. And it is exceedingly rash to argue from\r\ntitles, which, as we know from those of the plays remaining to us in\r\ntheir entirety, bore as little necessary relation to contents in ancient\r\nas in modern times.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  This passage, which is twenty-five lines long, is from the play\r\n  _Chiron_, and may be found at p. 110 of the Didot edition of Meineke’s\r\n  _Poet. Com. Græc. Fragmenta_. Egger (p. 40) only gives it in\r\n  translation. It is not in the least literary but wholly _musical_ in\r\n  subject, Music appearing in person and complaining of the alteration\r\n  of the lyre from seven strings to twelve.\r\n\r\nIt may be pleaded, of course, that our comic fragments are very mainly\r\npreserved to us by grammarians, scholiasts, and lexicographers, who were\r\nmore likely to find the unusual locutions for which they principally\r\nlooked in those descriptions of the fishmarket and the stews, of which\r\nwe have so many, than in literary disquisitions. But in these myriads of\r\nfragments, motelike as they often are, it is contrary to probability\r\nthat we should not find at least a respectable proportion of allusions\r\nto any subject which was frequently treated by the comic writers, just\r\nas we do find references not merely to fish and the hetæræ, but to\r\nphilosophy (such references are common enough), to cookery, politics,\r\ndress, and all manner of things except literary criticism. Parodies of\r\nserious pieces there may have been; but parody, though akin to\r\ncriticism, is earlier,[28] and is rather criticism in the rough. And it\r\nis probable, or rather certain, that the example of the greatest of\r\nComic poets was followed by the smaller fry in attacks on Euripides; but\r\nthese attacks need not have been purely literary at all. The contrast\r\nbetween comedy and tragedy attributed to Antiphanes[29] in his _Poiesis_\r\nbears solely on the subject, and the necessity of greater inventiveness\r\non the part of the comic poet.\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  Thus we find it constantly in the Middle Ages, where pure criticism is\r\n  still almost unknown.\r\n\r\nOnce only, so far as I have been able to discover, do we come upon a\r\npassage which (if it be genuine, of which there [Sidenote: _Simylus_\r\n(?).] seems to be doubt for more than one reason) has undoubted right to\r\nrank. This is the extremely, the almost suspiciously, remarkable passage\r\nattributed to the Middle Comic poet, Simylus, by Stobæus, who, be it\r\nremembered, can hardly have lived less than eight or nine hundred years\r\nlater. This advances not only a theory of poetry and poetical criticism,\r\nbut one of such astonishing completeness that it goes far beyond\r\nanything that we find in Aristotle, and is worthy of Longinus himself at\r\nhis very happiest moment, while it is more complete than anything\r\nactually extant in the Περὶ Ὕψους. It runs as follows:[30] “Neither is\r\nnature without art sufficient to any one for any practical achievement,\r\nnor is art which has not nature with it. When both come together there\r\nare still needed a _choragia_,[31] love of the task, practice, a lucky\r\noccasion, time, a _critic able to grasp what is said_. If any of these\r\nchance to be missing, a man will not come to the goal set before him.\r\nNatural gifts, good will, painstaking method—this is what makes wise and\r\ngood poets. Number of years makes neither, but only makes them old.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  See Egger (p. 73), who as usual makes a little too much of it. The\r\n  original may be found in Athenæus (at the opening of Bk. vi. 222 _a_:\r\n  vol. i. p. 485, ed. Dindorf), where it is followed by a burlesque\r\n  encomium on tragedy from the comic poet Timocles, or in Meineke, ed.\r\n  cit., p. 397.\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  As the Greek is not in some editions of Meineke’s _Fragments_, and is\r\n  not given by Egger at all, while his translation is very loose, it\r\n  will be best to quote it in full from the former’s edition of Stobæus'\r\n  _Florilegium_, ii. 352:—\r\n\r\n                 Οὔτε φύσις ἱκανὴ γίγνεται τέχνης ἄτερ\r\n                 πρὸς οὐδὲν ἐπιτήδευμα παράπαν οὐδενί,\r\n                 οὔτε πάλι τέχνη μὴ φύσιν κεκτημένη.\r\n                 τούτων ὁμοίως τοῖν δυοῖν συνηγμένων\r\n                 εἰς ταυτόν, ἔτι δεῖ προσλαβεῖν χορηγίαν,\r\n                 ἔρωτα, μελέτην, καιρὸν εὐφυῆ, χρόνον,\r\n                 κριτὴν τὸ ῥηθὲν δυνάμενον συναρπάσαι.\r\n                 ἔν ᾧ γὰρ ἂν τούτων τις ἀπολειφθεὶς τύχῃ,\r\n                 οὐκ ἔρχετ’ ἐπὶ τὸ τέρμα τοῦ προκειμένου.\r\n                 φύσις, θέλησις, ἐπιμέλει’, εὐταξία\r\n                 σοφοὺς τίθησι κἀγαθούς· ἐτῶν δέ τοι\r\n                 ἄριθμος οὐδὲν ἄλλο πλὴν γῆρας ποιεῖ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  _I.e._, the official acceptance of the piece, and the supply of a\r\n  chorus to bring it out. It ought, however, perhaps to be added that\r\n  the word is often used in a more general sense, “appliances and\r\n  means,” pecuniary and otherwise.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to put the matter better after more than two\r\nthousand years of literary accumulation and critical experiment. But it\r\nis very hard to believe that it was said in the fourth century before\r\nChrist. The wits, indeed, are rather those of that period than of a\r\nlater; but the experience is that of a careful comparer of more than one\r\nliterature. In other words, it is the voice of Aristotle speaking with\r\nthe experience of Quintilian. And it stands, let me repeat, so far as I\r\nhave been able to discover, absolutely alone in the extant\r\nrepresentation of the department of literature to which it is\r\nattributed.\r\n\r\nTo pass from Aristophanes and Plato to Isocrates is to pass from persons\r\nof the first rank in literature to a person not of [Sidenote:\r\n_Isocrates._] the first rank. Yet for our purpose the “old man eloquent”\r\nis not to be despised. On the contrary, he even has special and\r\nparticular value. For the worst—as no doubt also the best—of men like\r\nAristophanes and Plato is, that they are too little of their time and\r\ntoo much for all time. Moreover, in Isocrates we come not merely to a\r\nman above the common, though not reaching the summits of wit, but also\r\nto something like a “professional”—to some one who, to some extent,\r\nsupplies the loss of the earlier professionals already mentioned.\r\n\r\nTo some extent only: for Isocrates, at least in so far as we possess his\r\nwork, is a rhetorician on the applied sides, which commended themselves\r\nso especially to the Greeks, not on the pure side. The legend of his\r\ndeath, at least, fits the political interests of his life; his rhetoric\r\nis mostly judicial rhetoric; little as he is of a philosopher, he\r\nattacks the sophists as philosophers were in duty bound to do. His\r\npurely literary allusions (and they are little more) have a touch of\r\nthat amusing, that slightly irritating, that wholly important and\r\ncharacteristic patronage and disdain which meets us throughout this\r\nperiod. He was at least believed to have written a formal _Rhetoric_,\r\nbut it is doubtful whether we should find much purely literary criticism\r\nin it if we had it. His own style, if not exactly gaudy, is pretentious\r\nand artificial: we can hardly say that the somewhat vaguely favourable\r\nprophecy which Plato puts into the mouth of Socrates about him at the\r\nend of the _Phædrus_ was very conspicuously fulfilled. And his critical\r\nimpulses cannot have been very imperative, seeing that though he lived\r\ntill nearly a hundred, he never found the “happy moment”[32] to write\r\nabout poetry spoken of in the 12th section of the Panathenaic with a\r\nscornful reference to those who “rhapsodised and chattered” in the\r\nLyceum about Homer and Hesiod and other poets. Most of his actual\r\nliterary references are, as usual, ethical, not literary. In the 12th\r\nand 13th section of the oration-epistle to Nicocles[33] he upbraids\r\nmankind for praising Hesiod and Theognis and Phocylides as admirable\r\ncounsellors in life, but preferring to hear the most trumpery of\r\ncomedies; and himself declares Homer[34] and the great tragic masters\r\nworthy of admiration because of their mastery of human nature. In the\r\n_Busiris_[35] he takes quite a Platonic tone about the blasphemies of\r\npoets against the gods. There is, indeed, a curious and interesting\r\npassage in the _Evagoras_[36] about the difficulties of panegyric in\r\nprose, and the advantages possessed by verse-writers. They have greater\r\nliberty of handling their subject; they may use new words and foreign\r\nwords and metaphors; they can bewitch the soul with rhythm and metre\r\ntill even bad diction and thought pass unnoticed. For if (says the\r\nrhetor naïvely enough) you leave the most celebrated poets their words\r\nand meaning, but strip them of their metre, they will cut a much\r\nshabbier figure than they do now. But this does not take us very far,\r\nand with Isocrates we get no further.\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  εὐκαιρίαν. Ed.

Criticism, in any full and\r\nfertile sense of the word, implies in all cases a considerable body of\r\nexisting literature, in almost all cases the possibility of comparing\r\nliteratures in different languages. The Greeks were but accumulating\r\n(though accumulating with marvellous rapidity) the one; they had as yet\r\nno opportunity of the other, and it must be confessed that they did not\r\nwelcome the opportunity with any eagerness when it came. All the more\r\nglory to them that, when as yet the accumulation was but proceeding,\r\nthey produced such work in the kind as that of Plato and Aristophanes;\r\nthat at the first halt they made such astonishing, if in some ways such\r\nnecessarily incomplete, use of what had been accumulated, as in the next\r\nchapter we shall see was made by Aristotle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                               ARISTOTLE.\r\n\r\nAUTHORSHIP OF THE CRITICISM ATTRIBUTED TO ARISTOTLE—ITS\r\n    SUBJECT-MATTER—ABSTRACT OF THE ‘POETICS’—CHARACTERISTICS,\r\n    GENERAL—LIMITATIONS OF RANGE—ETHICAL TWIST—DRAWBACKS\r\n    RESULTING—OVERBALANCE OF MERIT—THE DOCTRINE OF ἁμαρτία—THE\r\n    ‘RHETORIC’—MEANING AND RANGE OF “RHETORIC”—THE CONTENTS OF\r\n    THE BOOK—ATTITUDE TO “LEXIS”—VOCABULARY: “FIGURES”—A\r\n    DIFFICULTY—“FRIGIDITY”—ARCHAISM—STOCK EPITHET AND PERIPHRASIS—FALSE\r\n    METAPHOR—SIMILE—“PURITY”—“ELEVATION”—PROPRIETY—PROSE RHYTHM—LOOSE\r\n    AND PERIODIC STYLE, ETC.—GENERAL EFFECT OF THE ‘RHETORIC’—THE\r\n    “HOMERIC PROBLEMS”—VALUE OF THE TWO MAIN TREATISES—DEFECTS AND\r\n    DRAWBACKS IN THE ‘POETICS’—AND IN THE ‘RHETORIC’—MERITS OF\r\n    BOTH—“IMITATION”—THE END OF ART: THE οἰκεία ἡδονή—THEORY OF\r\n    ACTION—AND OF ἁμαρτία—OF POETIC DICTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe uncomfortable conditions which have prevailed during the examination\r\nof Greek criticism during the Pre-Aristotelian [Sidenote: _Authorship of\r\nthe criticism attributed to Aristotle._] age disappear almost entirely\r\nwhen we come to Aristotle himself. Hitherto we have had either no texts\r\nat all, mere fragments and titles, or else documents fairly voluminous\r\nand infinitely interesting as literature, but as criticism indirect,\r\naccidental, and destitute of professional and methodical character. With\r\nthe _Rhetoric_ and the _Poetics_ in our hands, no such complaints are\r\nany longer possible. It is true that in both cases certain other\r\ndrawbacks, already glanced at, still exist, and that the _Poetics_, if\r\nnot the _Rhetoric_, is obviously incomplete. But both, and especially\r\nthe shorter and more fragmentary book, give us so much that it is almost\r\nunreasonable to demand more—nay, that we can very fairly, and with no\r\nrashness, divine what the “more” would have been like if we had it. In\r\nthese two books the characteristics of Greek criticism, such as it was\r\nand such as probably in any case it must have been, are revealed as\r\nclearly as by a whole library.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with them we are happily, here as elsewhere, freed from a\r\ntroublesome preliminary examination as to genuineness. There is no\r\nreasonable doubt on this head as far as the _Rhetoric_ goes, and I\r\nshould myself be disposed to say that there is no reasonable doubt as to\r\nthe _Poetics_, but others have thought differently. It so happens,\r\nhowever, that for our special purpose it really does not matter so very\r\nmuch whether the book is genuine or not. For it can hardly by any\r\npossibility be much later than Aristotle, and that being so it gives us\r\nwhat we want—the critical views of Greek literature when the first great\r\nage of that literature was pretty well closed. It is by Aristotle,\r\nprobably, by X or Z possibly, but in any case by a man of wide\r\nknowledge, clear intellect, and methodical habits.\r\n\r\nBefore we examine in detail what these views were, let us clearly\r\nunderstand what was the literature which this person (whom in both cases\r\nwe shall call, and who in both pretty certainly was, Aristotle) had\r\nbefore him. The bulk of it was in verse, and though unfortunately a\r\nlarge proportion of that bulk is now lost, we have specimens, and (it\r\nwould seem) many, if not most, of the best specimens, of all its kinds.\r\nOf a great body of epic or quasi-epic verse, only Homer and Hesiod\r\nsurvive; but Homer was admittedly the greatest epic, and Hesiod the\r\ngreatest didactic, poet of this class. In the course of less than a\r\ncentury an enormous body of tragic drama had been accumulated,\r\n[Sidenote: _Its subject-matter._] by far the greatest part of which has\r\nperished; but we possess ample specimens of the (admittedly) first Three\r\nin this kind also. Of the great old comic dramatists, Aristophanes\r\nsurvives alone—a mere volume, so to speak, of the library which\r\nAristotle had before him: yet it is pretty certain that if we had it\r\nall, the quantity rather than the degree and kind of literary pleasure\r\ngiven by the series from the _Acharnians_ to the _Plutus_ would be\r\nincreased. We are worst off in regard to lyric: it is here that\r\nAristotle has the greatest advantage over his modern readers. Yet, by\r\naccident or not (it may be strongly suspected _not_), it is the\r\nadvantage of which he avails himself least. On the other hand, some\r\nkinds—the pastoral, the very miscellaneous kind called epigram, and\r\nothers—were scarcely yet full grown; and, much of them as is lost, we\r\nhave more advantage of him.\r\n\r\nIn prose he had (or at least so it would seem likely) a lesser bulk of\r\nmaterial, and what he had was subject to a curious condition, of which\r\nmore hereafter. But he had nearly all the best things that we have—Plato\r\nand Xenophon, Herodotus and Thucydides, all the greatest of the orators.\r\nHere, however, his date again subjected him to disadvantages, the\r\ngreatest of which—one felt in every page of the _Poetics_, and not\r\ninsensible in the _Rhetoric_—was the absence, entire or all but entire,\r\nof any body of prose fiction. The existence, the date, the subjects, the\r\nvery verse or prose character of the “Milesian tales,” so often talked\r\nof, are all shadows of shades, and whatever they were, Aristotle takes\r\nno count of them. It seems to be with him a matter of course that\r\n“fiction” and “poetry” are coextensive and synonymous.[37]\r\n\r\nOf the enormous and, to speak frankly at once, the very disastrous,\r\ninfluence which this limitation of his subject-matter has on him, it\r\nwill be time to speak fully later. Let us first see what this famous\r\nlittle treatise[38]—than which perhaps no other document in the world,\r\nnot religious or political, has been the occasion of fuller\r\ndiscussion—does actually contain.\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  He does, no doubt, refer to the prose mimes, _v. infra_, and in\r\n  referring at the same time to the “Socratic dialogues” he may be\r\n  specially thinking of the “Egyptian and other” stories with which\r\n  Socrates was wont, half to please, half to puzzle, his hearers. But\r\n  his whole treatment of Tragedy and Epic is really based on some such\r\n  assumption as that in the text.\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  I need hardly express, but could not possibly omit the expression of,\r\n  my indebtedness to my friend and colleague Professor Butcher’s\r\n  admirable edition and translation of the work in _Aristotle’s Theory\r\n  of Poetry and Fine Art_ (London, 2nd ed., 1898), a book which, as much\r\n  as any other for many years past, enables English scholarship to hold\r\n  its head up with that of other countries. Nor need I make any\r\n  apologies for occasionally differing, on the purely critical side,\r\n  with him as to the interpretation of a document which is admittedly\r\n  very obscure in parts, and on even the clearest parts of which\r\n  opinion, not demonstration, must decide in very many cases.\r\n\r\nHe first defines his scheme as dealing with poetry itself and its\r\nvarious kinds, with their essential parts, with the [Sidenote: _Abstract\r\nof the_ Poetics.] structure of the plot, the number and nature of the\r\nparts, and the rest of poetic method. Then he lays it down that Epic,\r\nTragedy, Comedy, Dithyrambic, as well as _auletice_ and _kitharistice_\r\ngenerally, are _mimesis_—\"imitation,\" as it is generally translated—but\r\nthat they differ in the medium, the objects, and the manner of that\r\nimitation. And after glancing at music and dancing as non-literary\r\nmimetic arts, he turns to the art which imitates by language alone. Here\r\nhe meets a difficulty: there is, he thinks, no common name which will\r\nsuit the mimes of Sophron and Xenarchus, the “Socratic dialogues,” and\r\niambic or elegiac _mimesis_. He objects strongly to the idea that metre\r\nmakes the poet, and produces instances, among which the most striking is\r\nhis refusal of the name poet to Empedocles. Having disposed of the\r\n_medium_—rhythm, metre, &c.—he turns to the objects. Here he has no\r\ndoubt: the _objects_ of mimesis are men in action, and we must represent\r\nthem as “better than life” (heroic or idealising representation), as\r\nthey are (realistic), or worse (caricature or satire). The _manner_ does\r\nnot seem to suggest to him much greater diversity than that of epic (or\r\ndirect narrative), and dramatic, as to the latter of which he has a\r\nslight historical excursus.\r\n\r\nThen he philosophises. Poetry, he says, has two causes: one the instinct\r\nof imitation, with the pleasure attached to it; the other, the instinct\r\nfor harmony. And then he again becomes historical, and reviews briefly\r\nHomer, Æschylus, Sophocles, and the progress of poetry under them.\r\n\r\nComedy he dismisses very briefly. He thinks that it ἔλαθε διὰ τὸ μὴ\r\nσπουδάζεσθαι—little attention was paid to it, as not being taken\r\nseriously. Epic and tragedy must be treated first—tragedy first of all.\r\nAnd then he plunges straight into the famous definition of tragedy,\r\ndiscussion of which had best be reserved. The definition itself is this:\r\n“An imitation of an action, serious, complete, and possessing magnitude,\r\nin language sweetened with each kind of sweetening in the several parts,\r\nconveyed by action and not recital, possessing pity and terror,\r\naccomplishing the purgation of such[39] emotions.” Tragedy will require\r\nscenic arrangements, musical accompaniments, and “words,” as modern\r\nactors say; his own term, “lexis,” is not so very different. But it will\r\nalso require character, “thought,” and plot or story. The most important\r\nof all is the last, which he also describes by another name, the\r\n“setting together of incidents,” the Action—to which he thinks character\r\nquite subsidiary, and indeed facultative. There cannot, he says\r\ncategorically, be tragedy without action; there may be without\r\ncharacter. “The most powerful elements of emotional interest,” as\r\nProfessor Butcher translates οἷς ψυχαγωγεῖ, “the things with which\r\ntragedy leads souls,” are revolutions and discoveries, and these are\r\nparts of action. Novices can do good things in diction and in character,\r\nnot in plot. Still Character is second. Thought is third, Diction\r\napparently a bad fourth. Song is only a chief embellishment or\r\n“sweetening,” and Scenery is the last of all, because, though\r\ninfluencing the soul, it is inartistic and outside poetry. So he turns\r\nonce more as to the principal or chief thing, to the plot or action.\r\nThis is to be a complete whole, and of a certain magnitude, with a\r\nbeginning, middle, and end. A very small animal organism[40] cannot be\r\nbeautiful, as neither can one “ten thousand stadia long.” Then he comes\r\nto the great question of Unity—or, since that word is much blurred by\r\nusage, let us say “what makes the story one.” It is not enough to have a\r\nsingle hero; life, even a part of a life, is too complicated for that.\r\nWe must have just so much and just so little that the action shall\r\npresent neither gaps nor redundancies. Nor need the poet by any means\r\nstick to historical or prescribed fact—the probable, not the actual, is\r\nhis game. He may invent wholly (subject to this law of probability) if\r\nhe likes. Plots with episodes are bad.\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  There are strong arguments for rendering τῶν τοιούτων not “such” but\r\n  “these,” and Professor Butcher actually does so.\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  Here one of the first very important differences of interpretation\r\n  comes in. Professor Butcher would translate ζῷον “picture,” as though\r\n  it were short for ζῷον γεγραμμένον. Scholars differ whether the word\r\n  _can_ by itself have this meaning, and on such a point I have no\r\n  pretensions to decide. But its more common sense is certainly “living\r\n  organism,” and I feel certain that this is the only meaning which\r\n  makes full critical sense here. To begin with, Aristotle has just used\r\n  it in this way, and in the second place the analogy of another _art_\r\n  would come in very ill. We want a comparison drawn from _nature_, to\r\n  give us the law for the imitation of nature.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, to go further. Not only must the action of tragedy be\r\ncomplete and probable, but it must deal with terrible and pitiful\r\nthings: if these surprise us, so much the better. After distinguishing\r\nbetween simple plots (without Revolution and Discovery) or complex (with\r\nthem), and describing these two elements at more length, he attacks, in\r\na rather suspected passage, the Parts—Prologue, Episode, Exodus,[41] the\r\nchoric part, &c.—and then, preferring the complex scheme, shows how it\r\nis to be managed. The hero must not blamelessly pass from prosperity to\r\nadversity, nor blamefully in the opposite direction. He must be a person\r\nof considerable position, who by some error or weakness (ἁμαρτία) comes\r\nto misfortune. Also the special kind of pity and terror which is to be\r\nemployed to make him interesting, the _oikeia hedone_ of tragedy, is\r\nmost important, not a few examples being taken in illustration from the\r\ngreat tragedians.\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  “Episode” is here defined in quite a new sense as the dialogue\r\n  _between_ choruses; “Exodus” as that which no chorus follows. The\r\n  chapter is doubtful—or something more.\r\n\r\nThen we pass to Character. It must be good—even a woman is good\r\nsometimes—it must be appropriate, true to life, and consistent.\r\nProbability is here as important as in Action; the _Deus ex machina_ is\r\nto be used with extreme caution. After turning to the details of\r\nDiscovery, and dealing with Gesture, Scene, &c., he goes to the two main\r\nstages of Tragedy, _desis_ and _lusis_, Twisting and Unravelling, and to\r\nits four kinds (an extension of his former classification)—Simple,\r\nComplex, Pathetic, and Ethical. And the tragic poet is especially warned\r\nagainst Tragedy with an Epic structure—that is to say, a variety of\r\nplots. The Chorus must bear part in the action, and not give mere\r\ninterludes.\r\n\r\n“Thought” is somewhat briefly referred to Rhetoric (_vide infra_), and\r\nthen we come to Diction. This is treated rather oddly, though the oddity\r\nwill not seem so odd to those who have carefully studied the contents,\r\nstill more the texts, of the foregoing chapter. Much of the handling is\r\npurely grammatical. The “Figures,” especially metaphor, make some\r\nappearance: and of style proper we hear little more than that it is to\r\nbe clear without being mean, though we have some illuminative examples\r\nof this difference.\r\n\r\nThen Aristotle passes briefly to Epic, his prescription for which is an\r\napplication of that already given—the single action, with its beginning,\r\nmiddle, and end. The organism, with its _oikeia hedone_, the parts, the\r\nkinds are the same, with the exception of song and scenery. The only\r\ndifferences are scale (Epic being much larger) and metre, with a fuller\r\nallowance for the improbable, the irrational. Some rather desultory\r\nremarks on difficulties of criticism or interpretation follow, and the\r\npiece ends abruptly with a consideration of the purely academic question\r\nwhether Epic or Tragedy ranks higher. Some had given the primacy to\r\nEpic: Aristotle votes for Tragedy, and gives his reasons.\r\n\r\nThis summary has been cut down purposely to the lowest point consistent\r\nwith sufficiency and clearness; but I trust it is neither insufficient\r\nnor obscure. We may now see what can be observed in it.\r\n\r\nWe observe, in the first place, not merely a far fuller dose of\r\ncriticism than in anything studied hitherto, but also a great [Sidenote:\r\n_Characteristics, general._] advance of critical _theory_. Not only has\r\nthe writer got beyond the obscure, fragmentary, often irrelevant,\r\nutterances of the early philosophers: but he is neither conducting a\r\nparticular polemic, as was Aristophanes, nor speaking to the previous\r\nquestion, like Plato. An _a posteriori_ proof of the depth and solidity\r\nof the inquiry may be found in the fact that it is still, after more\r\nthan two thousand years, hardly in the least obsolete. But we are not\r\ndriven to this: its intrinsic merit is quite sufficient.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, there are certain defects and drawbacks in it which\r\nare of almost as much importance as its merits, and which perhaps\r\nrequire prior treatment. That it is incomplete admits of no doubt; that\r\npart of it shows signs of corruption, that there are possible garblings\r\nand spurious insertions, does not admit of very much. But the view\r\nthroughout is so firm and consistent; the incidental remarks tally so\r\nwell with what we should expect; and, above all, the exclusions or\r\nbelittlings are so significant, that if the treatise were very much more\r\ncomplete, it would probably not tell us very much more than we know or\r\ncan reasonably infer already.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we can see, partly as a merit and partly as a\r\ndrawback, that Aristotle has not merely confined himself with\r\nphilosophical exactness to the Greek literature actually before him, but\r\nhas committed the not unnatural, though unfortunate, mistake of taking\r\nthat literature as if it were final and exhaustive. He generalises from\r\nhis materials, especially from Homer and the three Tragedians, as if\r\nthey provided not merely admirable examples of poetic art, but a\r\nCatholic body of literary practice to go outside of which were sin. It\r\nis impossible not to feel, at every moment, that had he had the _Divina\r\nCommedia_ and Shakespeare side by side with the _Iliad_ and Æschylus,\r\nhis views as to both Epic and Tragedy might have been modified in the\r\nmost important manner. And I at least find it still [Sidenote:\r\n_Limitations of range._] more impossible not to be certain that if there\r\nhad been a Greek Scott or a Greek Thackeray, a Greek Dumas or a Greek\r\nBalzac before him, his views as to the constitutive part of poetry being\r\nnot subjective form but “imitative” substance would have undergone such\r\na modification that they might even have contradicted these now\r\nexpressed. If tragedy, partly from its religious connection, partly from\r\nits overwhelming vogue, but most of all from the flood of genius which\r\nhad been poured into the form for two or three generations past, had not\r\noccupied the position which it did occupy in fact, it would probably not\r\nhave held anything like its present place in the _Poetics_. And so in\r\nother ways. It may be consciously, it may be unconsciously, Aristotle\r\ntook the Greek, and especially the Attic, literature, which constituted\r\nhis library, and treated this as if it were all literature. What he has\r\nexecuted is in reality an induction from certain notable but by no means\r\nall-embracing phenomena; it has too much of the appearance, and has too\r\noften been taken as having more than the appearance, of being an\r\nauthoritative and inclusive description of what universally is, and\r\nuniversally ought to be.\r\n\r\nWe have also to take into account the Greek fancy for generalising and\r\nphilosophising, especially with a strong ethical [Sidenote: _Ethical\r\ntwist._] preoccupation. Aristotle does not show this in the fantastic\r\ndirections of the earlier allegorising critics, but he is doubly and\r\ntrebly ethical. He has none of the Platonic doubts about Imitation as\r\nbeing a bad thing in itself, but he is quite as rigid in his\r\nprescription of good subjects. Although we have no full treatment of\r\nComedy, his distaste—almost his contempt—for it is clear; and debatable\r\nas the famous “pity and terror” clause of the definition of tragedy may\r\nbe, its ethical drift is unmistakable.\r\n\r\nThus his criticism, consciously or unconsciously, is warped and twisted\r\nby two unnecessary controlments. On the one [Sidenote: _Drawbacks\r\nresulting._] hand, he looks too much at the actual occupants of his\r\nbookcase, without considering whether there may not be another bookcase\r\nfilled with other things, as good but different. On the other, he is too\r\nprone, not merely to generalise from his facts as if they were the only\r\npossible facts, but to “overstep the genus” a little in his\r\ngeneralisation, and to merge Poetics in Ethics. That others went further\r\nthan he did, that they said later that a hero must not only be good but\r\nwhite, and superadded to his Unity of Action a Unity of Time and a Unity\r\nof Place, which his documents do not admit, and which his doctrines by\r\nno means justify, are matters for which, no doubt, he is not to be\r\nblamed. But of the things for which he is legitimately responsible, some\r\nare not quite praiseworthy.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, “Imitation” is an awkward word, though no doubt it\r\nis more awkward in the English than in the Greek, and “Representation”\r\nor “Fiction” will get us out of part of the difficulty. Not only does\r\nthis term for the secondary creation proper to art belittle it too much,\r\nbut it suggests awkward and mischievous limitations: it ties the poet’s\r\nhands and circumscribes his aims.[42] Indirectly it is perhaps\r\nresponsible for Aristotle’s worst critical slip—his depreciation of\r\nCharacter in comparison with Action. This very depreciation is, however,\r\na serious shortcoming; and so is the failure to recognise, despite some\r\nnot indistinct examples of it in the matter before him from the\r\n_Odyssey_ downwards, what has been called “Romantic Unity,” that is to\r\nsay, the Unity given by Character itself, though the action may be\r\nlinear and progressive rather than by way of _desis_ and _lusis_. The\r\nattempt to extend (save in respect of scale only) the limitations of\r\nTragedy to Epic is another fault; and so perhaps is the great complexity\r\nand the at least not inconsiderable obscurity of the definition of\r\nTragedy itself. In such a treatise as this it is possible merely to\r\nallude to the famous clause, “through pity and terror effecting the\r\n_katharsis_ of such emotions.” Volumes have been written on these few\r\nwords,[43] the chief crux being, of course, the word _katharsis_. It\r\ncannot be said that any of the numerous solutions is by itself and to\r\ndemonstration correct, but it is clear that the addition is out of\r\nkeeping with the rest of the definition. Hitherto Aristotle, whether we\r\nagree with him or not, has been purely literary, but he now shifts to\r\nethics. You might almost as well define fire in terms strictly\r\nappropriate to physics, and then add, “effecting the cooking of sirloins\r\nin a manner suitable to such objects.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n  In all modern languages, though no doubt not in Greek, “Imitation”\r\n  carries with it a fatal suggestion of copying previous examples of\r\n  art, and not going direct to Nature at all. I think there is no\r\n  reasonable doubt that this suggestion is responsible by itself for\r\n  much of the mistakes of modern “Classical” criticism in the sixteenth,\r\n  seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. You must “imitate” Homer,\r\n  Virgil, Milton, not “represent” Nature.\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  Those who do not care to “grapple with whole libraries” will find\r\n  excellent handlings of the question in Butcher, _op. cit._, pp.\r\n  236-237, and Egger, _op. cit._, pp. 267-300.\r\n\r\nYet the advantages of this criticism far exceed its drawbacks. In the\r\nfirst place it is, not merely so far as we positively know, [Sidenote:\r\n_Overbalance of merit._] but by all legitimate inference, the earliest\r\nformal treatise on the art in European literature. In the second place,\r\neven if it sticks rather too close to its individual subject, that\r\nindividual subject was, as it happens, so marvellously rich and perfect\r\nthat no such great harm is done. A man will always be handicapped by\r\nattempting to base criticism on a single literature, yet he who knows\r\nGreek only will be in far better case than he who only knows any one\r\nother, except in so far as the knowledge of any later literature\r\ninevitably conveys an indirect dose of knowledge of Greek.\r\n\r\nThen, too, Aristotle’s use of his material is quite astonishingly\r\njudicious. In almost every single instance we might [Sidenote: _The\r\ndoctrine of_ ἁμαρτία.] expect his limitations to do him more harm than\r\nthey have done. He might, for instance, with far more excuse than\r\nWordsworth, have fallen into Wordsworth’s error of considering metre not\r\nmerely as not essential to poetry, but as only accidentally connected\r\nwith it. And it is also extremely remarkable how little, on the whole,\r\nhis ethical preoccupation carries him away. He exhibits it; but it does\r\nnot blind him (as it had blinded even Plato) to the fact that the\r\nspecial end of Art is pleasure, that the perfection of literature is not\r\nan end in itself but a means to an end. Even more surprising is the\r\nacuteness, the sufficiency, and the far-reaching character of his\r\ndoctrine of the Tragic ἁμαρτία. For there can be no question that he has\r\nhere hit on the real differentia of tragedy—a differentia existing as\r\nwell in the tragedy of Character, which he rather pooh-poohs, and in the\r\nRomantic tragedy which he did not know, and on his actual principles was\r\nbound to disapprove if he had known it, as in the Classical. Shakespeare\r\njoins hands with Æschylus (and both stand thus more sharply contrasted\r\nwith inferior tragedians than in any other point) in making their chief\r\ntragic engine “the pity of it,” the sense that there is infinite excuse,\r\nbut no positive justification, for the acts which bring their heroes and\r\nheroines to misfortune. Wherever the tragedian, of whatever style and\r\ntime, has hit this ἁμαρτία, this human and not disgusting “fault,” he\r\nhas triumphed; wherever he has missed it, he has failed, in proportion\r\nto the breadth of his miss.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the minor and verbal points of the _Poetics_ there is\r\nless to say, because there is very much less of them: [Sidenote: _The_\r\nRhetoric.] and what there is to say had better be said when we have\r\nconsidered the contents of the other great critical book, the\r\n_Rhetoric_, which may be taken as holding, if not intentionally yet\r\nactually, something of the same position towards Prose as that which the\r\n_Poetics_ holds towards verse.\r\n\r\nBefore giving an analysis of this book,[44] to match that given above of\r\nthe _Poetics_, a few words may properly be said to justify [Sidenote:\r\n_Meaning and range of “Rhetoric.”_] what may seen to be the rather\r\narbitrary proceeding of, on the one hand, attaching to Rhetoric a sense\r\navowedly somewhat different from Aristotle’s, and on the other dropping\r\nconsideration of the major part of what he has actually written in it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  No edition with commentary can here be recommended to English readers\r\n  with quite such confidence as Professor Butcher’s _Poetics_. That of\r\n  E. M. Cope (3 vols., Cambridge, 1877), with a fourth, but earlier,\r\n  volume of Introduction (London, 1867), is extremely full and useful,\r\n  though the Germans (see Römer’s edition after Spengel, Pref., p.\r\n  xxxiv) scoff at its text. Dr Welldon’s translation is well spoken of:\r\n  and the old “Oxford” version, reprinted with some corrections in\r\n  Bohn’s Library, is not contemptible, while Hobbes’s “Brief” (or\r\n  Analysis), which accompanies it, is very valuable indeed. But here, as\r\n  elsewhere, he who neglects the original neglects it at his peril.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to force too much the bare meanings of words; but I\r\nsuppose one may, without much danger of controversy, take the bare\r\nmeaning of Rhetoric to be “speechcraft.” Now, it is not difficult to\r\nprove that, in Aristotle’s time, speechcraft practically included the\r\nwhole of prose literature, if not the whole of literature. Poems were\r\nrecited; histories were read out; the entire course of scientific and\r\nphilosophic education and study went on by lecture or by dialogue. Nay,\r\nit is perhaps not fanciful to point out that the very words for reading,\r\nἀναγιγνώσκω and ἐπιλέγομαι seem to represent it as at best a secondary\r\nand parasitic process, a “going over again” of something previously said\r\nand heard.[45]\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  Professor Butcher rather doubts this stress of mine on the\r\n  prepositions, and points out to me that ἐπιλέγομαι (in the sense of\r\n  reading) is almost exclusively Herodotean, and never established\r\n  itself generally in Greek. But he admits that the more usual\r\n  employment of ἀναγιγνώσκω for “reading _aloud_” bears on my point.\r\n\r\nYet though this is an important point, and has been rather too commonly\r\noverlooked, it is no doubt inferior in gravity to the universally\r\nrecognised fact that the importance of speechcraft proper, of oratory,\r\nwas in Greece such as it is now only possible dimly to realise. Every\r\npublic and private right of the citizen depended upon his power to speak\r\nor the power of somebody else to speak for him; a tongue-tied person not\r\nonly had no chance of rising in the State, but was liable to be\r\ninsulted, and plundered, and outraged in every way. To some it has\r\nseemed that the great and almost fatal drawback to that Athenian life,\r\nwhich in not a few ways was life in a sort of Earthly Paradise, was the\r\nincessant necessity of either talking or being talked to. It was\r\ntherefore not in the least wonderful that the first efforts—those of the\r\nSicilian sophists (or others)—to reduce to something like theory the art\r\nof composition, of arranging words effectively, should be directed to\r\n_spoken_ words, and to spoken words more particularly under the\r\nall-important conditions of the public meeting and the law court—by no\r\nmeans neglecting the art of persuasion, as practicable in the Porch, or\r\nthe Garden, or the private supper-room. That prose literature—that all\r\nliterature—has for its object to give pleasure dawned later upon men.\r\nAristotle and persons much earlier than Aristotle—Corax and Tisias\r\nthemselves—would probably have acknowledged that prose, like poetry,\r\nought to please, but only as a further means to a further end,\r\npersuasion. Its object was to make men _do_ something—pass or negative\r\nsuch a law, bring in such a verdict, appoint such an officer, or (in the\r\nminor cases) believe or disbelieve such a tenet, adopt or shun such a\r\ncourse of conduct. Even in poetry, as we have seen, the ethical\r\npreoccupation partly obscured the clear æsthetic doctrine—you were to be\r\npurged as well as pleased, and pleased in order that you might be\r\npurged. But in prose the pleasure became still more subsidiary,\r\nancillary, facultative. You were first of all to be “persuaded.”\r\n\r\nNow, if this be taken as granted, and if, further, we keep in mind\r\nAristotle’s habit of sticking to the facts before him, we [Sidenote:\r\n_The contents of the book._] shall not be in the least surprised to find\r\nthat the _Rhetoric_ contains a great deal of matter which has either the\r\nfaintest connection with literary criticism, or else no connection with\r\nit at all. It is true that of the three subjects which the _Rhetoric_\r\ntreats, _pistis_ (means of persuasion), _lexis_ (style), and _taxis_\r\n(arrangement), the second belongs wholly and the third very mainly to\r\nour subject, while it would be by no means impossible for an ingenious\r\narguer to make good the position that _pistis_, with no extraordinary\r\nviolence of transition, may be laid at least under contribution for that\r\n_attractive_ quality which all literature as a pleasure-giving art must\r\nhave. But in actual handling _Pistis_ has two out of the three books,\r\nand is treated, as a rule, from a point of view which leaves matters\r\npurely literary out of consideration altogether—\"The Characteristics of\r\nAudiences,\" “The Colours of Good and Evil,” “The Passions as likely to\r\nexist in an Audience,” “The Material of Enthymeme” (the special\r\nrhetorical syllogism), and so forth.\r\n\r\nOnly in the third book (which, by the way, is shorter than either of the\r\nother two) do we get beyond these counsels to the advocate and the\r\npublic speaker, into the Higher Rhetoric which concerns all prose\r\nliterature and even some poetry. And even then we meet with a sort of\r\n_douche_ of cold water which may not a little dash those who have not\r\ngiven careful heed to the circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\nInquiry into the sources and means of persuasion (our author admits\r\ngraciously, but with a touch of superiority which, [Sidenote: _Attitude\r\nto_ lexis.] as we shall see, accentuates itself later) does not quite\r\nexhaust Rhetoric. It must also discuss style and arrangement. But style\r\nis a modern thing, and, rightly considered, something _ad\r\ncaptandum_.[46] Indeed Aristotle never seems to keep it quite clear from\r\nmere elocution or delivery—from the art of the actor as\r\ncontradistinguished from that of the writer. He remarks that he has\r\ndealt with style fully in his _Poetics_; and as he has certainly not\r\ndone so in the _Poetics_ which we have, this is an argument that they\r\nare incomplete, though by no means that they are spurious. But it is\r\nalmost impossible to mistake the touch of patronage, not to say of\r\nscorn, with which he deals with it here, and we need not doubt that, if\r\nwe had the other handling to which he refers, something of the same sort\r\nwould appear there. The fact is, that the Greeks of this period were\r\nwhat we may call High-fliers; anything that had the appearance of being\r\n“mechanical,” anything that seemed to subject the things of the spirit\r\nto something not wholly of the spirit, they regarded with suspicion and\r\nimpatience, which rather suggests the objection of some theologians to\r\ngood works. Words, like colours, materials of sculpture and\r\narchitecture, and the like, were “filthy rags”; and if Aristotle’s\r\ncommon-sense carried him a little less far in this direction than his\r\nmaster Plato’s philosophical enthusiasm, it certainly carried him some\r\nway.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  Τὸ περὶ τὴν λέξιν ὀψὲ προῆλθεν· καὶ δοκεῖ φορτικὸν εἶναι, καλῶς\r\n  ὑπολαμβανόμενον. See note at end of chapter.\r\n\r\nThis same common-sense, however, seldom deserted him, and it makes\r\nsometimes wholly for good, sometimes a little less [Sidenote:\r\n_Vocabulary—\"Figures\"._] so, throughout the treatise. At the very outset\r\nhe commits himself to that definition of style as being first of all\r\n_clear_—as giving the meaning of the writer—which has so often\r\ncaptivated noble wits down to Coleridge’s time, and even since, but\r\nwhich yet is clearly wrong, for “two and two make four” is the _a per\r\nse_ of clearness, and there is uncommonly little style in it\r\nnotwithstanding. That he himself saw this objection cannot be doubted,\r\nfor he hastens to add[47] that it must be not only clear, but neither\r\ntoo low nor too far above the subject, thus producing a useful and\r\nperfectly just distinction between the styles of poetry and prose. And\r\nthen he gives us, as he had done in the _Poetics_, one of those\r\ndistinctions of his which are so valuable—the distinction of vocabulary\r\ninto what is κύριον or current (which conduces to clearness), and what\r\nis ξένον or unfamiliar (which conduces to elevation). Let us note that\r\nthis, like the ἁμαρτία theory in the _Poetics_, is one of Aristotle’s\r\ngreat critical achievements. But the note of greatness may perhaps be\r\ndiscovered less in the attention which from this point he begins to pay\r\nto Metaphor. Not of course that metaphor is not a very important thing;\r\nbut that the example of ticking it off in this fashion with a name\r\nspread rapidly in Rhetoric, and became a mere nuisance. Even Quintilian,\r\nwho spoke words of wit and sense about the Greek mania for baptising new\r\nFigures, submitted to them to some extent: and any one who wishes to\r\nappreciate the need of Butler’s jest to the effect that\r\n\r\n                       “all a rhetorician’s rules\r\n                 Teach nothing but to name his tools,”\r\n\r\nhas no farther to look than to the portentous list at the end of\r\nPuttenham’s _Art of Poetry_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  He had earlier, in the most grudging context, admitted that _lexis_\r\n  gives _character_ to a speech, that συμβάλλεται πολλὰ πρὸς τὸ φανῆναι\r\n  ποιόν τινα τὸν λόγον—a confession from which can be extracted, at\r\n  least in germ, all that a very fanatic of style need contend for.\r\n\r\nYet his cautions as to metaphors themselves, which he regards as the\r\nchief means of embellishment in prose, are perfectly just and sound.\r\nThey must, he says, be selected with careful reference to the particular\r\neffect intended to be produced, be euphonious, not far-fetched, and\r\ndrawn from beautiful objects.\r\n\r\nHere, perhaps as well as in reference to any single passage in the\r\n_Poetics_, we have an opportunity of considering for the [Sidenote: _A\r\ndifficulty._] first time a difficulty, not unexpected, not\r\nuninteresting, which meets us, and which will recur frequently, in\r\nancient (and sometimes in the most modern) criticism. It is the\r\ndifficulty which so did please Locke and his followers in the attack on\r\nthe doctrine of Innate Ideas,—in other words, the difficulty of an\r\napparently hopeless difference of standard on points of taste—the\r\ndifference between Greek and modern love, between English and Hottentot\r\nbeauty. One should, says the philosopher, say ῥοδοδάκτυλος rather than\r\nφοινικοδάκτυλος, while ἐρυθροδάκτυλος is the worst of all. The\r\ncommentators have tried to get out of the difficulty by suggesting that\r\nthe last suggests the redness of frost-bitten or domestically disfigured\r\nfingers. φοινικοδάκτυλος would in the same way, I suppose, be considered\r\nas objectionable because the colour is overcharged in the epithet, and\r\nmight even suggest “red-handed” in the sense of “bloodstained.” Yet one\r\nmay doubt whether Aristotle’s objection is based on anything but the\r\nfact that Homer uses the one epithet, not the others. The verb ἐρυθριάω,\r\nat any rate, is invariably used for blushing, not an unattractive or\r\nunbeautiful proceeding by any means. And we shall find very much\r\nstronger instances of this difficulty later.\r\n\r\nThe explanation is partly supplied by the very next section, which deals\r\nwith ψυχρότης and is one of the most valuable [Sidenote: “_Frigidity._”]\r\nkeys existing to the whole tone of Greek, indeed of classical,\r\ncriticism. It is rather unlucky that “frigidity,” our only equivalent,\r\nis not quite clear to English ears. In fact, “fustian” comes nearest to\r\nwhat is meant, though it is not completely adequate and coextensive. The\r\nidea is not difficult to follow—it is that of something which is\r\nintended to excite and inflame the auditor or reader, while in fact it\r\nleaves him cold, if it does not actually lower his spiritual\r\ntemperature. Aristotle gives four cases, or (which is nearly the same\r\nthing) four kinds of it—words excessively compounded, foreign terms, too\r\nemphatic or minute epithets, and improper metaphors. To these, as\r\ngeneralities, few would object, but the instances are sometimes\r\ndecidedly puzzling. Lycophron (the sophist, not the poet) is blamed for\r\ncalling the heavens πολυπρόσωπον (“many-visaged”), the earth\r\nμεγαλοκόρυφον (“mightily mountain-topped”), and the shore στενοπόρον\r\n(“leaving a narrow passage between cliff and sea”). Now, perhaps these\r\nterms are too poetical, yet we should hardly call them frigid, for they\r\nare not untrue to nature, and they not only show thought and imagination\r\nin the writer, but excite both in the reader. Still, they are all\r\nslightly _excessive_; they pass measure, as do other things blamed in\r\nAlcidamas and Gorgias still more.\r\n\r\nThe second objection is of still greater interest, because it has\r\npractically supplied a shibboleth in the Classic-Romantic debate\r\n[Sidenote: _Archaism._] up to the present moment. It is the objection to\r\narchaic, foreign, and otherwise inusitate words, which Aristotle seems\r\nto apply even to Homeric terms, not as poetic but as obsolete, just as\r\nother good persons in times nearer our own have applied the same to\r\nChaucerisms and the like. The sounder doctrine, of course, is that\r\n_nullum tempus occurrit regi_ in this transferred sense also—that what\r\nthe old kings of literature have stamped remains current for ever, and\r\nwhat the new kings of literature stamp takes currency at once.\r\n\r\nAlmost as interesting is the third punishment-cell, in which epithets\r\ntoo long, too many, or out of place are bestowed. The [Sidenote: _Stock\r\nepithet and periphrasis._] two habits which seem to be mainly aimed at\r\nhere (Alcidamas is still the chief awful example) are the use in prose\r\nof the poetical perpetual epithet (“white milk” is the example chosen)\r\nand the undue tendency to periphrasis, which, curiously enough, reminds\r\none of the besetting sin of the extreme “Classical” school of the last\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nMost puzzling of all are the examples pilloried for impropriety in the\r\nfourth class, the unfortunate Alcidamas being rebuked for calling\r\nphilosophy “the intrenchment of law,” and [Sidenote: _False metaphor._]\r\nthe Odyssey a “mirror of human life.” The most, thoroughgoing\r\nAristotelians have given up this last criticism with an acknowledgment\r\nthat ancient and modern tastes differ; while Mr Cope even suggests that\r\nAristotle “winked,” not nodded, when he wrote the whole passage. I do\r\nnot so easily figure to myself a winking Stagirite.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on Simile which follows there is much that is sensible,\r\nbut nothing that is surprising—the relation of simile [Sidenote:\r\n_Simile._] and metaphor being the main point. One’s expectations are\r\nmore raised in coming to the great subject of “purity” of\r\nstyle—\"Hellenising,\" “writing Greek.” This phrase, in our author, is\r\ndirected against something corresponding rather to the French “fautes de\r\nFrançais” than to our “not English,” having regard to the syntax, the\r\nsentence-building, [Sidenote: “_Purity._”] rather than to the actual\r\ndiction. But it differs from both in having, like so much of his\r\ncriticism, more to do with matter than form. In fact, it has been well\r\nobserved that “Perspicuity” rather than “Purity” is really the subject\r\nof the chapter. It is, however, of great importance, and the next, on\r\nElevation, or Grandeur, or Dignity, is [Sidenote: “_Elevation._”] of\r\ngreater still. Some slight difficulty may occur at starting with the\r\nword thus variously rendered in English, ὄγκος. In its non-rhetorical\r\nuse, the word (which strictly means “bulk,” with the added notion of\r\nweight) inclines rather to an unfavourable signification, often\r\nsignifying “pretentiousness,” “pomposity”: it is sometimes used later in\r\nRhetoric itself with such a meaning; and I think those who compare the\r\nearlier passage on Frigidity will be inclined to suspect that Aristotle\r\nhimself was not using it entirely _honoris causa_. He gives, however,\r\nsome hints for its attainment, and a bundle of instances, where our\r\nignorance of the context makes the illustrative power somewhat small.\r\n\r\nNext we come to that quality of τὸ πρέπον, “the becoming,” “propriety,”\r\nwhich is commonly and not wrongly taken to be [Sidenote: _Propriety._]\r\nthe special note of “classical” writing. And we have rules for its\r\nattainment, some ethical rather than æsthetic, some æsthetic enough but\r\ncuriously arbitrary, as that unusual words are not appropriate _except\r\nto_ a person in a state of excitement. At the close there is an\r\ninteresting glance at the irony of Gorgias and of Socrates.\r\n\r\nThe next division is one of the very _apices_ of the whole. It deals\r\nwith that subject of the rhythm of prose which, though [Sidenote: _Prose\r\nrhythm._] (as we see from Quintilian as well as from Aristotle) never\r\nneglected by the ancients, is one of the most difficult parts of their\r\ncritical Rhetoric for us to understand, and (perhaps for that reason)\r\nhas been, till the last hundred years or so, strangely neglected in the\r\ncriticism of modern languages.\r\n\r\nWe see from its very opening words that the great distinctions between\r\nverse and prose literature on the one hand, and between literary and\r\nnon-literary composition on the other, had been already hit upon. Prose\r\nstyle, says he, must be neither _emmetron_ nor _arrhythmon_—that is to\r\nsay, it must not have metre nor lack rhythm. But he does not very\r\naccurately define the difference between these things; and it cannot be\r\nsaid that any of his commentators and successors have supplied this\r\ndefect, though it is easy enough to do so.[48] He, however, allows feet\r\nif not metre in prose, and proceeds to inquire what feet will do, making\r\nobservations on the subject which are in the three degrees of obscurity\r\nto all who are not fond of guessing. Dactylic, iambic, and trochaic\r\nrhythms are dismissed for various reasons, rather bad than good—it not\r\nhaving apparently struck the critic that all these arrange themselves\r\ntoo _easily_, certainly, and definitely into metre. He pitches finally\r\non the pæan, a foot which, though admissible in those Greek choric\r\nmeasures which are a sort of compromise between prose and poetry, at\r\nonce reveals its suitableness for prose in modern languages by the fact\r\nthat it is unsuitable for modern verse. The pæan or pæon is a\r\ntetrasyllabic foot, consisting of three short syllables and a long one,\r\nof which in strictness there may be four varieties, the long syllable\r\nbeing admissible in any of the four places. But Aristotle only admits\r\ntwo, with the long syllable in the first and fourth place respectively.\r\nAnd here, most tantalisingly, he breaks off.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  Metre being neither more nor less than definitely _recurrent_ rhythm,\r\n  first within the line, then in corresponding lines.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between loose and periodic style,[49] which the modern\r\ncomposition-books have run so tiresomely to death, [Sidenote: _Loose and\r\nperiodic style, &c._] and which is really a very unimportant technical\r\ndetail, follows; and then we return to those Delilahs of the ancient\r\nrhetorician, Figures—Metaphor once more, Antithesis, Personification,\r\nHyperbole, &c. Yet even this is more to our purpose than the\r\ndemonstration that follows, showing that each kind of Rhetoric,\r\njudicial, deliberative, and declamatory, should have its particular\r\nstyle. And with this the handling of _lexis_ proper closes, the rather\r\nbrief remainder of the book being devoted partly to _taxis_\r\n(_ordonnance_, as Dryden would say), but with special reference to the\r\nneeds of the pleader, and partly to a fresh handling of the old\r\nquestions of enthymeme, the dispositions of the audience, and the like.\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  In the Greek εἰρομένη, “strung together,” and κατεστραμμένη,\r\n  “inter-twisted.”\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this that the _Rhetoric_, like the _Poetics_, is\r\ninvaluable to the historian of literary criticism, but that, in\r\n[Sidenote: _General effect of the_ Rhetoric.] this case as in that,\r\nliterary criticism was only partly the object in the writer’s eye, while\r\neven so far as he had it before him, his views were very largely\r\nlimited, and were even in some cases distorted, coloured, and positively\r\nspoilt by certain accidents of place, time, and circumstance. As our\r\npoetical criticism was injuriously affected by the non-existence of the\r\nnovelist, so our prose criticism is injuriously affected by the\r\nomnipresence of the orator. As our Poetics were adulterated with ethic\r\nand other things, so our Rhetoric is warped by poetical,\r\njurisprudential, and other preoccupations. In the first, poetry itself\r\nis not indeed itself a secondary consideration, but divers secondary\r\nconsiderations ride it, like a company of old men of the sea. In the\r\nsecond, prose as prose is merely and avowedly a secondary consideration:\r\nit is always in the main, and sometimes wholly, a mere necessary\r\ninstrument of divers practical purposes.\r\n\r\nTo supplement these two general treatises, we could wish for more\r\nparticular applications, but we have not got them. We have indeed some\r\nvestiges of work of the kind which are not altogether encouraging. M.\r\nEgger[50] has endeavoured to extract some references to literary\r\ncriticism from the general _Problems_; but these deal at best with the\r\nremotest fringes of the topic—why melancholy is so often apparent in\r\npersons of genius, and the like,—questions indeed of the very first\r\ninterest, but not of the kind which we are here pursuing. In the extant\r\nfragments, however, which belong or may have belonged to the lost\r\n_Homeric Problems_[51] (or _aporems_ or _zetems_) [Sidenote: _The_\r\nHomeric Problems.] we have metal more attractive. It may be said that\r\nthe scholiasts, through whom we have most of these excerpts, were likely\r\nto select them according to the principles which, as we shall see,[52]\r\ngoverned themselves; but they do not all come through scholiasts, and\r\nyet the complexion of all is more or less uniform. It is that\r\n“ethical-dramatic” complexion, as we may call it, which we have noticed\r\nand shall notice as being the Greek critical “colour”—sometimes to the\r\nutter exclusion, and almost always to the effacement, of actual\r\ncriticism. “Why did Agamemnon try experiments on the Greeks? Why did\r\nOdysseus take his coat off? Why is Menelaus represented as having no\r\nfemale companion? Why [a curial instance of that commentatorial _lues_\r\nwhich infects the greatest commentators as the least, the most ancient\r\nas the most modern] is Lampetie represented as carrying to the Sun the\r\nnews of the slaughter of his oxen, when the Sun sees everything? Why did\r\nthe poet make Paris a wretch who was not only beaten in duel, who not\r\nonly ran away, but who was specially excited by love immediately\r\nafterwards?”\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  _Op. cit._, p. 194 _sq._\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\n  _Aristotelis Fragmenta._ Ed. Valentine Rose, Leipsic, 1886. P. 120\r\n  _sq._\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n\r\n  See below, p. 73 _sq._\r\n\r\nThese are mainly moral questions; but the great philosopher appears to\r\nhave carried his solicitude so far as to meddle with military matters.\r\n“Why [somebody had asked], in _Il._ iv. 67-69, are the cavalry\r\nrepresented as marshalled in front, the cowards in the middle, and the\r\nbest infantry behind?” If Aristotle had heard of the “cavalry screen” he\r\nwould no doubt have used this _lusis_: as it is, it appears, he\r\nsuggested that _prota_ means not “in front” but “on the wings.” And\r\nthere is all the quality which endeared Aristotle to the idler side\r\n(which was not the only side by any means) of Scholasticism, in his\r\ncondescension to the _aporia_—\"If the gods drank nothing but nectar, why\r\nis Calypso spoken of as ‘mixing’ for Hermes? For any ‘mixture,’ even\r\nwith water, is something different from nectar; and, therefore, as the\r\ngods do not drink their nectar neat, they do not drink that only.\" Quoth\r\nthe great master (in reply, or at least “Schol. T.” says so), “The word\r\ndoes not only mean to ‘mix,’ but also simply to ‘pour,’ and this is what\r\nCalypso did.” But why should Calypso herself and Circe and Ino, alone of\r\ngoddesses, have the epithet αὐδήεσσα? Even he could not answer that, and\r\nwas driven ignominiously to suggest a change of reading.\r\n\r\nIt is not, I hope, necessary to say that I have no intention of raising\r\nan inept laugh at the Great One. As has been already said, the attitude\r\nof the Greeks to Homer was the attitude of a seventeenth-century Puritan\r\nto the English Scriptures. Every word, almost every letter, had its\r\nreason and its meaning—often many more than one—which had to be\r\nreverently sought out. The analogy, however, itself establishes and\r\nmakes clear my point, which is to show that an attitude of this kind\r\npractically excludes pure literary criticism on the one hand, and is\r\nexceedingly unlikely on the other to be taken up by any one who is\r\nstrongly bent towards such criticism. We know how Milton, who must have\r\nhad an exquisite critical gusto originally, and who never wholly lost\r\nit, was by the cultivation of such an attitude so stunted and checked in\r\nhis taste that he could throw the reading of Shakespeare in his dead\r\nking’s face,[53] dismiss the delightful work (hardly inferior to the\r\nbest of his own) of the Cavalier poets as “vulgar amorism” and “trencher\r\nfury,” and even when he was not thinking of matter, sink all critical\r\nperspective in his blind craze against rhyme itself. The Homer-worship\r\nof the Greeks on the one hand, and their philosophical preoccupations on\r\nthe other, had almost unavoidably a similar effect, though not so bad a\r\none.\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  I have, I think, seen protests against this statement. The protesters\r\n  either do not know Milton’s text, or are of that foolish order of\r\n  worshippers which simply shuts its eyes to disagreeable “næves” in the\r\n  idol.\r\n\r\nYet the value of the two main documents is so inestimable, that if the\r\nincompleteness and the shortcomings of the _Poetics_, the unavoidable\r\nirrelevance of much of the _Rhetoric_, [Sidenote: _Value of the two main\r\ntreatises._] were far greater than they are, our gratitude for both\r\nwould still be hard to exaggerate. We have here not merely the first\r\nconstituting documents, the earliest charters at once and discussions of\r\nEuropean criticism, but we have them from the hand of a master whose\r\nvery weaknesses make him, as compared with some other masters, specially\r\nfit for the office of critic. For the magnificent but almost always _a\r\npriori_ and unpractical metaphysics of Plato, for the shrewd but\r\npersonal and rather unfair polemic of Aristophanes, we have a patient\r\nexamination of a subject in itself so rich and varied, that one regrets\r\nhaving to point out that its riches and its variety are not quite\r\nexhaustive. Nowhere, perhaps, does Aristotle sketch the actual _Wesen_\r\nof the man of letters with the dæmonic completeness of the author of the\r\nextraordinary passage attributed to Simylus and quoted formerly; but\r\nthat might be, and probably is, a mere flash. His own conclusions, only\r\nsometimes inadequate, very seldom positively erroneous, exhibit the true\r\nmodes of criticism as perhaps they have never been exhibited since—with\r\nan equal combination of patience and of power. It is impossible for\r\nAristotle to do harm, unless his principles are not merely taken too\r\nliterally, but augmented and falsified, as was done by the “classical”\r\ncriticism of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It is impossible\r\nfor any one who undertakes the office of a critic to omit the study of\r\nhim without very great harm. Let us first review briefly what seem to be\r\nthe shortcomings, accidental or essential, of his performance, and then\r\nset down what its better parts establish for us as the state of Literary\r\nCriticism at the close of the first and greatest age of Greek\r\nliterature, at the close of the first age of the literature of Europe as\r\na whole.\r\n\r\nPartly by mere induction from actual Greek practice, and partly no doubt\r\nalso as a genuine result of Greek [Sidenote: _Defects and drawbacks in\r\nthe_ Poetics.] taste and literary philosophy, we find the importance and\r\nthe character of certain kinds of literature treated with some\r\nextravagance. The importance of Tragedy (as we are enabled to see\r\nclearly by the invaluable though rather unfair aid of the historic\r\nestimate) is altogether exaggerated. It never, as a matter of fact, has\r\nheld anything like the position here assigned to it, save twice in two\r\nthousand years and more, on each occasion for a generation or two only.\r\nAnd there is no reason, in the order and logic of thought, why it should\r\nhold such a position. It is again clearly evident (though we owe the\r\nclearness again not to our own wits, but to time and chance) that part\r\nof this importance is attained by an illegitimate sacrifice, or an\r\naccidental ignoring, of the just claims of other branches of\r\nliterature—by making lyric a mere playhouse handmaid, by converting the\r\nstage into a pulpit, and by blocking out, not merely the existence, but\r\nthe very possibility, of the prose novel. We can see further that the\r\nglorious achievements of the three great tragedians whom we in part\r\npossess, and of others, probably not much inferior, whom we have almost\r\nwholly lost, seduced their critic into taking what he found in them too\r\nhastily for what ought to be found in all—induced him (aided no doubt by\r\nthe Greek taste generally) to exalt Plot, to depress Character, to put\r\nquite undue stress on artificial Unity. Lastly (to keep to the\r\n_Poetics_), we perceive a most unfortunate, though by no means\r\ninexplicable, tendency to give insufficient weight to Metre, and a\r\ndecided inclination, on the one hand not to give quite enough importance\r\nto Diction, and on the other to lay down arbitrary rules about it.\r\n\r\nSomething of the same general tendency manifests itself in\r\nthe _Rhetoric_, reinforced by the necessary results of the\r\nPersuasion-theory, [Sidenote: _And in the_ Rhetoric.] and the inordinate\r\nimportance given to Oratory. With every possible allowance for the\r\nundoubtedly true plea that Aristotle had no intention of writing a\r\ntreatise on Prose Composition generally, but only one on such Prose\r\nComposition as suited the purposes of the Orator, we can see that if he\r\nhad written _Prosaics_, to match the _Poetics_, the same limitations\r\nwould have appeared. He cannot free himself from the notion that there\r\nis, after all, something derogatory in paying great attention to style:\r\nand it is clear that he does not _wish_ to consider a piece of prose as\r\na work of art destined, first of all, if not finally, to fulfil its own\r\nlaws on the one hand, and to give pleasure on the other. The salutary\r\nbut easily exaggerated difference between prose and poetic style is\r\nactually exaggerated here. Above all, the germ of mischief, if not\r\nexactly the mischief itself, is clearly discernible in his account of\r\nthe Figures of Speech. It was the drawback, not merely (as is sometimes\r\nsaid unjustly) of the Platonic philosophy only, but of all Greek\r\nphilosophy, to “multiply entities”—to take for granted that because\r\nnames are given to things, things must necessarily exist behind names.\r\nAnd so, instead of regarding these Figures as merely rather loose,\r\nsometimes not inconvenient, but in reality often superfluous, tickets\r\nfor certain literary devices and characteristics, there grew up, if not\r\nin Aristotle himself, at any rate in his followers, a tendency to regard\r\nthe Figures (which were soon enormously multiplied) as drugs or simples,\r\nexisting independently, acting automatically, and to be “thrown in,” as\r\nthe physician exhibits his pharmacopœia, to produce this or that\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nBut enough of this. It is the pleasanter, and, though not in kind, yet\r\nin degree, the more important, business of the historian, to call\r\nattention to the enormous positive [Sidenote: _Merits of both._] advance\r\nwhich we make with these two books. It is almost the advance from chaos\r\nto cosmos; and we shall find nothing in all the rest of the history\r\nquite to match it, though the resurrection of Criticism with the revival\r\nof learning, and the reformation of it at the Romantic era, come\r\nnearest.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we find the great kinds of literature, if not\r\nfinally and exhaustively, yet in nearly all their most important points,\r\ndiscerned, marked off, and as far as possible furnished with\r\ndefinitions. The most important of all demarcations, that between poetry\r\nand prose, is rather taken for granted than definitely argued out; but\r\nwe see that, with whatever hesitations and reservations, it _is_ taken\r\nfor granted. So, too, with the kinds of poetry itself. If prose is\r\ninadequately treated, both in general and in its departments, we have\r\nbeen able to assign something like a reason for that; and a good deal is\r\nactually done in this direction. In other words, the field, the “claim,”\r\nof literary criticism is pretty fairly pegged out.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the only sound plan—that of taking actually\r\naccomplished works of art and endeavouring to ascertain how it is that\r\nthey give the artistic pleasure—is, with whatever falterings, pretty\r\nsteadily pursued. The critic, as Simylus, Aristotle’s own contemporary,\r\nhas it, consistently endeavours to “grasp” his subject; and he does\r\ngrasp it over and over again.\r\n\r\nLet us review our positive gains from this grasp.\r\n\r\nThat the “Imitation” doctrine of the _Poetics_ is in some respects\r\ndisputable need not be denied; and that it lends itself rather easily to\r\nserious misconstruction is certain. [Sidenote: “_Imitation._”] But let\r\nus remember also that it is an attempt—probably the first attempt, and\r\none which has not been much bettered in all the improvements upon it—to\r\nadjust those proportions of nature and art which actually do exist in\r\npoetry. For by Imitation, whatever Aristotle did mean exactly, he most\r\ncertainly did _not_ mean mere copying, mere tracing or plaster-of-Paris\r\nmoulding from nature. It is not quite impossible that his at first sight\r\npuzzling objection to Alcidamas' use of the “mirror” as a description of\r\nthe _Odyssey_ had something to do with this.[54] A mirror, he would or\r\nmight have said, reproduces passively, slavishly, and without selection\r\nor alteration: the artist selects, adapts, adjusts, and if necessary\r\nalters. Now this is the true doctrine, and all deviations from, it,\r\nwhether in the shape of realism, impressionism,[55] and the like, in the\r\none direction, or of adherence to generalised convention on the other,\r\nhave always led to mischief soon or late. The artist must be the mime,\r\nnot the mirror: the reasonable, discreet, free-willed agent, not the\r\npassive medium. The single dictum that poetry does not necessarily deal\r\nwith the actual but with the possible—that it is therefore “more\r\nphilosophic,” higher, more universal, than history, though it requires\r\nboth extension and limitation, will put us more in the true critical\r\nposition than any dictum that we find earlier, or (it may be very\r\nfrankly added) than most that we shall find later.[56]\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  It has been objected to this suggestion that the context does not\r\n  favour it. Perhaps; but there is often a good deal working in an\r\n  author’s mind which the immediate context does not fully show.\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  On Impressionism, see Index.\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  And yet the “corruption” which dogs “the best” followed on this also.\r\n  For it was on this dictum that false classicism based its doctrine\r\n  that the poet ought not to count the streaks of the tulip—that he must\r\n  conventionalise and be general.\r\n\r\nSo, too, the all-important law that the end of art is pleasure appears\r\nsolidly laid down.[57] True, it is not laid down so explicitly as it is\r\nin the _Metaphysics_ and the _Politics_, [Sidenote: _The end of art:\r\nthe_ οἰκεία ἡδονή.] but it is assumed throughout, and such assumption\r\npractically more valuable than argument. We have left behind us the\r\nnoble wrongheadedness of the Platonic depreciation of pleasure; we are\r\neven past the stage when it might seem necessary to plead humbly and\r\nwith bated breath for its _locus standi_. Moreover, the doctrine of the\r\n_oikeia hedone_ not only by implication lays down the end of all art,\r\nbut guards (in a fashion which should have been sovereign, though the\r\nhaste and heedlessness of men have too often robbed it of its virtues)\r\nagainst one of the greatest dangers and mistakes of criticism in time to\r\ncome. That what we have to demand of a work of literature is pleasure,\r\nand its own pleasure—how simple this seems, how much a matter of course!\r\nAlas! Aristotle himself is not entirely free from the charge of having\r\nsometimes overlooked it, while since his time the great majority of\r\ncritical errors are traceable to this very overlooking. The obstinate\r\nignoring or the captious depreciation of Latin literature by the later\r\nGreeks; the wooden “Arts of Poetry” of the Latins themselves; the scorn\r\nof Chaucer for “rim-ram-ruffing”; of the Renaissance for mediæval\r\nliterature; of Du Bellay for Marot; of Harvey for the _Faerie Queene_;\r\nof Restoration criticism for the times before Mr Waller improved our\r\nnumbers; of our Romantic critics for Dryden and Johnson; of Mr Matthew\r\nArnold for French poetry,—all these things, and many others of the same\r\nclass, come from the ignoring of the _oikeia hedone_, from the obstinate\r\ninsistence that this thing shall be other than it is, that this poet\r\nshall be not himself but somebody else.\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  See for this point especially Professor Butcher’s chapter on this\r\n  subject _op. cit._, pp. 197-213.\r\n\r\nAgain, whatever we may think of the relative importance assigned to plot\r\nand to character by Aristotle, as well as of not [Sidenote: _Theory of\r\nAction_,] a few minor details of his theory of plot or action, there is\r\nno denying the huge lift given to the intelligent enjoyment of\r\nliterature by the distinction of these two important elements, and by\r\nthe analysis of action if not of character. With the aid of such\r\nrefinements we cease, as Dryden has it, to “like grossly,” to accept our\r\npleasure without distinction of its gradations or inquiry into its\r\nsource. The artist no longer aims in the dark; his processes are no\r\nlonger mere rules—if rules at all—of thumb. And this is also the\r\njustification, though by no means the sole justification, of such minor\r\nmatters as _peripeteia_ and _anagnorisis_, as _desis_ and _lusis_. True,\r\nthere is here, as in the case of the Figures, a danger that a convenient\r\ndesignation _a posteriori_ may be taken as a primæval and antecedent\r\nlaw. But this is the, in one sense, inevitable, in another very evitable\r\nand gratuitous, danger of all philosophical, scientific, and artistic\r\ninquiry. Fools can never be prevented from taking the means for the end,\r\nthe ritual for the worship, the terminology for the spirit; but means\r\nand ritual and terminology are not the less good things for that.\r\n\r\nMost of the points hitherto mentioned, though requiring, at the time and\r\nin the circumstances, immense pains, acuteness, and patience to discover\r\nand arrange them, are not beyond [Sidenote: _and of_ ἁμαρτία.] the reach\r\nof somewhat more than ordinary patience, acuteness, and pains. The\r\ntheory of ἁμαρτία, as has been shown since by its triumphant\r\njustification in the other great tragedy—the tragedy which seems at\r\nfirst sight to flout Aristotle’s rules—is a stroke of genius. To this\r\nday it has not been fully accepted; to this day persons, sometimes very\r\nfar indeed from fools, persist in confusing the tragic with the merely\r\npainful, with the monstrous, with the sentimental, and so forth.\r\nAristotle knew better, and has given here a touch of the really higher\r\ncriticism—of that criticism which does not waste time over the subject\r\nas such, which does not potter overmuch about details of expression, but\r\nwhich goes to the root of the matter, to the causes of a certain\r\npleasure indissolubly associated with literature, if not strictly\r\nliterary.\r\n\r\nNor, perhaps, ought we to be least grateful for the remarks on\r\n_lexis_—on poetic style proper. In details we may fail fully [Sidenote:\r\n_Of Poetic Diction._] to understand them, or, understanding, may\r\ndisagree with them; and there is no doubt that they are somewhat tinged\r\nwith that superior view of style, as something a little irrelevant, a\r\nlittle vulgar, which appears more fully in the _Rhetoric_, and which,\r\nwhile it has not entirely disappeared even at the present day, was\r\nnaturally rife at a time fresh from the views, and still partly under\r\nthe influence, of Socrates and Plato. Here once more we find those\r\nevidences of directness of grasp which are what we seek, especially in\r\nthe main description of poetic style, as being on the one hand “clear,”\r\nand yet on the other not “low,” and in the further specification of the\r\nmeans by which these characteristics are to be secured. More\r\nparticularly is this to be noticed in the indication of the ξένον—that\r\nis to say, the unfamiliar—as the means of avoiding “lowness.” Here from\r\nthe very outset we see that Aristotle (as Dante far later did, and as\r\nWordsworth later again did _not_) recognised the necessity of “Poetic\r\ndiction,”—the necessity, that is to say, of causing a slight shock, a\r\nslight surprise, in order to bring about the poetic pleasure. And by the\r\nexample which he gives of heightening and lowering the effect\r\nalternately, by substituting different words in the same general\r\ncontext, we see how accurately he had divined the importance of this\r\ndiction, whether we may or may not think that the fact is quite\r\nconsistent with his exaggerated view of Action. Aristotle’s verbal\r\ncriticisms are never, as (to speak frankly) the verbal criticisms of the\r\nancients too often are, mere _glossography_—mere dictionary work. They\r\nare invariably concerned with, and directed to, the literary value of\r\nthe word, and that is what we have to look to.\r\n\r\nThe positive gains, of or from the _Rhetoric_, are less, but hardly\r\nless. It follows from the special limitations of the plan, which have\r\nalready been dealt with, that we have no special theory of prose as\r\nsuch, and that, not merely some shortcomings, but some positive and\r\nmischievous delusions (such as the confusion of style with delivery),\r\nresult from it. But, in divers casual animadversions, he shows us that\r\nif by good fortune he had given us _Prosaics_, the book would, though it\r\nwere not more faultless than the _Poetics_, have been quite as valuable.\r\nAnd as it is, these things supply us with invaluable hints, glimpses,\r\n_points de repère_. The first, and not the least valuable, is the\r\ndistinction, used also in the _Poetics_, but there only casually and in\r\na glance, of words as κύρια and ξένα. Purity, “Amplification,”\r\nPropriety, while they at least suggest those dangers of misapprehended\r\nterminology which have been already dealt with, supply Criticism with\r\nthose appropriate classifications, and that necessary plant, without\r\nwhich no art can exist. And the importance of the rhythm-section cannot\r\nbe exaggerated.\r\n\r\nIndeed I have sometimes thought that, without extreme arbitrariness or\r\nfancifulness, even the _Pistis_ part of the Rhetoric may be made\r\nsubservient to pure criticism. It is not so very far from the effect of\r\npersuading or convincing the hearer to that of producing on the reader\r\nthe required effect—it may be of persuasion and conviction, it may be of\r\ninformation, or it may be simply of that subduing and charming which is\r\nthe end and aim of the prose artist as such, whether his name be Burke\r\nor Scott, Browne or Arnold, and whether his nominal division of\r\nliterature be history or fiction, criticism or philosophy, things human\r\nor things divine. The “Colours of Good and Evil,” the tendencies of the\r\nreaders, the fashions of the day and the passions of all days—these are\r\nthings which beyond all dispute will very mightily affect the\r\nappreciation of a book, and which, it may be argued not quite\r\nimproperly, condition, in no small degree likewise, its attainment of\r\nits object, its administration of its own pleasure.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the point, already more than once touched upon,\r\nthat we have now a Literary Criticism, regularly if not fully\r\nconstituted, may be regarded as established without need of further\r\nexposition or argument. In some respects, indeed, we have got no further\r\nthan Aristotle; we are still arguing on his positions, defending or\r\nattacking his theses. In others we have indeed got a good deal further,\r\nby virtue chiefly of the mere accretion of material and experience. We\r\nhave, perhaps, learned (or some of us have) to resign ourselves rather\r\nmore to the facts than he, with the enthusiasm of the first stage still\r\nhardly behind him, was able to do. We are less inclined to prescribe to\r\nthe artist what he shall do, and more tempted to accept what the artist\r\ndoes, and see what it can teach as well as how it can please us. But in\r\nthe wider sense of critical method we have not got so very far beyond\r\nhim in the poetical division. While if we have got beyond him in the\r\ndirection of prose (as perhaps we have), the advance has been very late,\r\nand can hardly be said even now to have, by common consent and as a\r\nclear matter of fact, covered, occupied, and reduced to order the\r\nterritory on to which it has pushed. Great as are Aristotle’s claims in\r\nalmost every department of human thought with which he meddles, it may\r\nbe doubted whether in any he deserves a higher place than in this. He is\r\nthe very Alexander of Criticism, and his conquests in this field, unlike\r\nthose of his pupil in another, remain practically undestroyed, though\r\nnot unextended, to the present day.\r\n\r\n                        -----------------------\r\n\r\n                            _Note to p. 42._\r\n\r\n  Attempts have been made to confine Aristotle’s slighting remarks on\r\n  _lexis_ to mere “delivery.” It is true that in the whole passage there\r\n  is a certain confusion of the different senses of “elocution.” But in\r\n  this sentence Aristotle has just said, τὸ περὶ τὴν λέξιν _not_\r\n  ὑπόκρισιν—that is to say, has covered the entire ground which he is\r\n  going to discuss. Even if φορτικὸν be violently restricted, by the\r\n  help of καὶ before τό, to ὑποκριτική (which occurs further back), the\r\n  general drift will remain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n     GREEK CRITICISM AFTER ARISTOTLE.

This\r\ncriticism had not, indeed, yet assumed the position of a recognised art.\r\nIt was at best a more or less dimly recognised function of Rhetoric,\r\nwhich on the one side was made to include a great deal which is not\r\nliterary criticism at all, and on the other hand was made to exclude\r\nPoetics. But Rhetoric, from this time onwards, more and more tends to\r\nbecome the Art of Literary Criticism generally, and to absorb Poetics\r\nwithin itself. So that on the one hand we shall find, among the Latins,\r\nQuintilian, whose strict business is with the strictly oratorical side\r\nof prose rhetoric, dealing freely with poetry, and on the other, among\r\nthe Greeks, Longinus (whose main subject is poetry), not hesitating to\r\ndraw examples from prose. Nor may it be wrong to discern in this awkward\r\nseparation of the two parts of criticism, and the yet more awkward\r\nadulteration of prose criticism with matters really foreign to it, an\r\nunconscious—nay, an unwilling—recognition of fact. For Poetry deals\r\nfirst of all with form, Prose with matter; though the matter can never\r\nbe a matter of entire indifference to Poetry, and the form becomes of\r\nmore and more importance as we ascend from the lower to the higher\r\nprose.\r\n\r\nAfter Aristotle we fall back, for the ages immediately following, on the\r\ndreary and perilous chaos of fragments and titles. [Sidenote:\r\n_Theophrastus and others._] From the extant work, indeed, of his chief\r\ndisciple, Theophrastus, we could guess that he dealt largely in\r\nRhetoric. It is no rash conjecture that the famous _Characters_\r\nthemselves were intended, after a fashion of which we have but too many\r\nother examples, to provide orators and writers with cut-and-dried types\r\non which to base their rhetorical appeals. Nay, we have titles as well\r\nas fragments of works of his bearing on the subject,—_on Style_, _on\r\nComedy_,—but nothing whereon to base a real estimate.[58] And what is\r\ntrue of Theophrastus is true of hundreds of others. Only those who are\r\nfond of the pastime of letting down buckets into empty wells can derive\r\nthe slightest satisfaction from knowing, or at least being informed,\r\nthat Aristotle of Cyrene wrote a _Poetic_ of which we have nothing, and\r\nPhanias of Eresus a work _On Poets_ of which we have a couple of\r\nscraps.[59] It is certain that a very considerable literature, at least\r\nostensibly critical, existed, dating from the third and later centuries.\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  As in other cases, Theophrastus has been criticised very largely on\r\n  rather slim vouchers. For instance, the quotation (in Cic. Orat., 39)\r\n  on the strength of which Mr. Nettleship, _Lectures and Essays_, ii.\r\n  47, speaks of him complimentarily, strikes me, I confess, as but a\r\n  commonplace remark enough. It is that by Herodotus and Thucydides,\r\n  “History was first stirred up to speak more freely and ornately.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  See for more, Egger, p. 347 _sq._\r\n\r\nTwo writers, later in time, not of much critical fertility but of some\r\ninterest, will illustrate for us the attitude of two Greek [Sidenote:\r\n_Criticism of the later Philosophical Schools: The Stoics._]\r\nphilosophical schools to criticism. None of these schools except the\r\nPeripatetics (and in a negative sort of way the Platonists) deserved\r\nvery well of our Tenth Muse. The Stoics—when they were not in that mood\r\nof disdainful tolerance which is represented by Epictetus' doctrine of\r\n“the Inn,”[60] of less tolerance still and more disdain as shown by\r\nMarcus Aurelius,[61] or of affected contempt, almost pure and simple, as\r\nin Seneca,[62] which was their later attitude—seem in their earlier days\r\nto have devoted themselves with great vigour to grammatical\r\ninvestigations, and at all times to have affected the allegorical style.\r\nBut we cannot wonder that they spent no pains on investigating, still\r\nless that they spent no pains on championing, that mixed intellectual\r\nand sensual pleasure which is the business and the glory of literature.\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  This doctrine, best known to English readers, perhaps, from Mr\r\n  Arnold’s not quite fair application of it to Théophile Gautier, is of\r\n  much more general application in the original (_Enchiridion_, cap.\r\n  52). Man being represented as a voyager to a far country, all\r\n  occupations save duty and philosophy are really mere “inns on the\r\n  journey,” pleasant perhaps for a night, but not good to stay in.\r\n  “Eloquence” is specially dwelt on as one of these “inns.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  Who thanks Heaven (i. 17) that he did not make more progress in\r\n  rhetoric and poetry.\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  _V. infra_, bk. ii. p. 245 _sq._\r\n\r\nThe attitude, however, of their principal antagonists is all the more\r\nsurprising. The Cynic vulgarity and insolence could not be expected to\r\nbusy itself profitably with letters, and, as we shall see shortly, the\r\nancient Pyrrhonists have at least left us nothing to show that they\r\ncould combine with their _Que sais-je?_ on philosophical points, the\r\nkeen literary enjoyment and the discriminating literary appreciation of\r\ntheir great modern champion. But the attitude of the Epicureans to\r\nliterature is one of the most surprising things in the history of\r\nancient philosophy.\r\n\r\nOne might have supposed, not merely that a Hedonist philosophy would\r\napply itself most joyfully and energetically to the investigation and\r\nthe vindication of one of the greatest of all sources of _ataraxia_ and\r\n_aponia_,[63] but that it would do [Sidenote: _The Epicureans:\r\nPhilodemus._] so with all the more vigour as thus vindicating itself\r\nfrom the common charge of esteeming only sensual pleasures. Yet, though\r\nthe scanty wreckage of original Epicurean writing warns us not to be too\r\nperemptory, there is absolutely no evidence that Epicurus, or any of his\r\nfollowers, took this side. Nay, the whole evidence available is\r\ndistinctly against any such supposition. Perhaps we could have no\r\nstronger testimony to the reluctance with which antiquity took the view\r\nof literature as a pleasure-giver, or rather to the rarity with which\r\nsuch a view even presented itself. If we were here indulging further in\r\nspeculation, it might not be improper to suggest that the atomic and\r\nnecessitarian theory of Epicurus deprived the operations of the artist\r\nof half their interest. But this would be to travel out of bounds. It is\r\nenough to say that Epicurus is accused of slighting critical discussion\r\naltogether, that his chief disciple Metrodorus appears to have written a\r\nbook on poetry which was a general attack on it as a useless and futile\r\nthing, and that the fragments of Philodemus of Gadara, which have been\r\nsalvaged from Herculaneum, go to support the same idea.\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  Freedom from trouble and pain; the former, especially, being the\r\n  technical term for the Epicurean _nonchalance_.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we must not lay too much stress on this. The charge\r\nagainst Epicurus and Metrodorus rests, mainly if not wholly, on the\r\ntestimony of Plutarch, who, as we shall see, took the merely ethical\r\nview of literature, and is found in that treatise of the _Moralia_ in\r\nwhich he sets himself to prove that Epicureanism cannot even give the\r\npleasure at which it aims And the tolerably abundant fragments of\r\nPhilodemus[64] are, even after all the pains spent on them, in such a\r\nchaos that only extremely temerarious arguers will do more than take a\r\nvague inference from them. The remark which the latest editor of this\r\npuzzle has made about one book—\"It is difficult to know whether\r\nPhilodemus or his opponent is speaking\"—applies, I should say, to almost\r\nall. Not only is this the case; but we can see, with hardly any danger\r\nof mistake, that if this difficulty were removed, and if we had the\r\nwhole treatise fully and fairly written out before us, our state would\r\nbe very little the more gracious. A very great, perhaps the greater,\r\npart of it seems to have been occupied with the discussion of one of\r\nthose endless technical questions—\"Is Rhetoric an _art_ or is it\r\nnot?\"—in which antiquity seems to have taken an interest, the utter\r\nunintelligibility of which to us is only tempered by the wise reflection\r\nthat plenty of our questions to-day will seem equally “ashes, cinders,\r\ndust” to students two thousand years hence. The real and solid\r\nconclusion is, once more, that we have not lost nearly so much as we\r\nseem to have lost by the disappearance of these endless treatises on\r\nrhetoric and on poetry. It is possible, of course, that one in a\r\nthousand of them might have been another Περὶ Ὕψους: it is far more\r\nprobable that not one would have been anything of the kind.\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  Ed. Ludhaus. Leipsic, 1892.\r\n\r\nIf Acatalepsy[65], the doxy of the Pyrrhonists, has been somewhat more\r\nfortunate in one way than her close connection [Sidenote: _The\r\nPyrrhonists: Sextus Empiricus._] the Ataraxia of the Garden, she has\r\npaid for that fortune in another. Except in the magnificent poem of\r\nLucretius, we have no complete document of Epicurean philosophy, and\r\nthere the philosophy is utterly eclipsed, burnt up, washed away, by the\r\nblaze and the torrent of the poetry. No such disturbing element enters\r\ninto the two very businesslike expositions of philosophic doubt which we\r\npossess in the _Pyrrhonic Sketches_ and the _Against the Dogmatists_ of\r\nSextus Empiricus.[66] But, if the one writer is almost too much of a\r\npoet, the other is very much too little of a prose writer. Scepticism\r\nhas assuredly no necessary connection with dulness, though it may have a\r\ngood deal with levity. But Sextus Empiricus is one of the dullest\r\nwriters of antiquity. There is not a spark, not a glimmer even, in his\r\nphrase, which is chiefly made up of the most damnable iteration of\r\ntechnical terms; his arrangement is desultory; and beyond a raking\r\ntogether of all the arguments, good, bad, and indifferent, for general\r\nor particular agnosticism, that he has read or can think of, he seems to\r\nfind it impossible to go. At the same time, modern writers have found by\r\nno means a bad subject for such handling in the contradictions, the\r\ninconsistencies, the ineptitudes of literary critics: the eighteenth\r\ncentury especially, from the writings of the great Scriblerus to the\r\n_Pursuits of Literature_, is full of such things. And if there is little\r\nof the kind (for there is something) in Sextus, we may not improperly\r\nset it down to the fact that he found little to fasten upon.\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  The incomprehensibleness of things; the impossibility of certain\r\n  knowledge.\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  Ed. Bekker. Berlin, 1842.\r\n\r\nWhat he gives is contained in three of the four last sections of\r\n_Against the Dogmatists_, those dealing with Grammarians, Rhetoricians,\r\nand Musicians respectively. In the last, which is the shortest, I do not\r\nknow that the example of childish cavilling quoted by Egger—that a bard\r\nwas set to look after Clytæmnestra, and Clytæmnestra murdered her\r\nhusband—is more or less childish than the solemn sophism (not quoted by\r\nhim) with which the chapter and the book closes, to the effect that as\r\nthere is no “time”[67] in the wide sense, so there can be no\r\n“time”—feet, rhythms, measures—in the narrow.\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  This is proved in the usual fallacy-fashion: Time must be past,\r\n  present, or future. Admittedly, neither past nor future time _is_;\r\n  present time is either divisible or indivisible, to each of which\r\n  there is an objection.\r\n\r\nThe section on Rhetoric is also short, and turns almost wholly upon the\r\nold _aporia_ whether Rhetoric is an art or not, with others of a similar\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nAs for the grammatical section, that does touch us nearer; indeed, when\r\nSextus divides Grammar into two parts, adopting for the second the\r\ndefinition of Dionysius of Thrace, that “Grammar is the knowledge[68] of\r\nwhat is said by the poets and prose writers,”[69] we seem to be almost\r\nat home. But in this expectation we should be counting without our host,\r\nthe sceptical physician, and, indeed, without antiquity generally. We\r\nhave first quibbling _à perte de vue_ about _empeiria_, then other\r\ndefinitions, then considerations of the mere grammatical elements. Only\r\nafter a long time does Sextus come to the grammarian’s business of\r\n_interpreting_ the poets and prose writers. And then he not only seems\r\nto be dealing with men of straw, but answers them with, as Luther would\r\nsay, a most “stramineous” argument. Poetry, it seems, they say (and it\r\nis fair to Sextus to admit that Plutarch and other people do in effect\r\nsay this) is useful as containing wise saws and philosophical instances:\r\ngrammar is necessary to understand poetry: therefore, grammar is good.\r\nHe does not care actually to attack poetry, but observes that, in so far\r\nas it provides matter useful or necessary for life, it is always clear,\r\nand wants no grammatical exposition, while (662-663) whatsoever deals in\r\nunfamiliar stories, or is enigmatically expressed, is useless, so that\r\ngrammar can do nothing useful with it. A subsequent contention, that\r\ngrammarians know neither the matter nor the words of literature, though\r\na little sweeping, might have chapter and verse given for it in the case\r\nof at least some critics. But when Sextus establishes his first point by\r\ntriumphing over the poor grammarians for not having perceived in a\r\nHomeric epithet an allusion to a pharmaceutical property, and in\r\nEuripides a point of clinical practice (671), he is either making a\r\nheavy joke or is utterly off the critical standpoint.\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  ἐμπειρία.\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  συγγραφεῖς. The opposition is as old as Plato, though συγγραφεὺς is\r\n  sometimes limited to “historian.”\r\n\r\nA third school, in its various stages, has perhaps a better, if a vague,\r\nrepute for attention to literature. Perverse as was in [Sidenote: _The\r\nAcademics._] many respects the attitude of Plato to the subject in\r\ndetail, it was impossible (or might have seemed impossible) that his\r\ndoctrine of _psychagogia_,[70] and the magnificent eulogies bestowed in\r\nthe _Ion_ and the _Phædrus_ on that poetry towards which he is elsewhere\r\nso severe, should not induce his followers—at whatever great a\r\ndistance—to do likewise. It seems, however, to have been found easier by\r\nthe earlier Academics to follow the crotchet than the enthusiasm, and\r\nmany of the puerile and servile quibbles to which we have referred as\r\nappearing in Sextus Empiricus seem to be of Academic origin.\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  The “leading of the soul” to truths, and gifts, and pleasures.\r\n  Aristotle likewise adopts the word: and indeed it contains in itself\r\n  the soul of criticism, though in Plato himself it sometimes has an\r\n  unfavourable meaning, of “allurement,” “seduction.”\r\n\r\nThe Neo-Platonists, at least, might be looked to with some hope. Their\r\nspirit at any rate was not negative, and they seem, [Sidenote: _The\r\nNeo-Platonists._] as a rule, to have been diligent and eager students of\r\nliterature. But, on the other hand, their tendency towards mysticism,\r\nand also the strong colour which their philosophy took from the East,\r\nmade them especially susceptible to the temptations of allegory, which,\r\nas we have seen and shall see, was a Delilah of criticism in almost all\r\nits stages in Greece. And when they escaped this they nearly always\r\nsuccumbed to the other temptations of merely grammatical and textual\r\ninquiries, or to those of an abstract and theoretical æstheticism, which\r\nleaves the actual estimation of literature as literature out of sight.\r\n\r\nThus, from the two great chiefs of the school, Plotinus and Proclus, we\r\nhave short treatises on the Beautiful—by Proclus [Sidenote: _Plotinus._]\r\nin the form of a commentary (not complete) on the _First Alcibiades_ of\r\nPlato, while the tractate of Plotinus[71] attaches itself somewhat less\r\nclosely to the _Hippias_. From the very first this latter keeps rigidly\r\nand laboriously to the abstract. Beauty, we are told, specially affects\r\nthe sense of sight, but the ear perceives it in eloquence, poetry, and\r\nmusic. It is also in emotions, in virtue, in science. Is all this\r\nderived from one principle or from many? What is it, or what are they?\r\nBut as there is both essential and accidental beauty, we must first\r\nsettle what the attractive principle is. A shrewd question, and one\r\nwhich, if followed out in the proper direction, would lead straight to\r\nthe best criticism of literature; but, unluckily, Plotinus does not so\r\nfollow it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  _Enn._, vi. 1. Separately printed with Proclus, in an edition which I\r\n  have not seen, by Creuzer, in 1814. M. Théry included a French\r\n  translation in the rather capriciously selected but interesting\r\n  appendix of _pièces justificatives_ appended to his _Histoire des\r\n  Opinions_; and I believe there is another.\r\n\r\nHe proceeds to examine and expose the difficulties attending the\r\nproposition that beauty comes mainly or chiefly from proportion of\r\nparts. There must rather, he holds, be in the soul some faculty of\r\nperceiving the divine quality, whether manifested in proportion or in\r\nanything else. The beauty of bodily substances depends on their affinity\r\nwith the divine: the beauty of things not recognised by the senses\r\ndepends on their identity with it. In yet other words, and from a yet\r\nother point of view, Beauty is Good, Ugliness is Evil: the attraction of\r\nthe first pair, the repulsion of the second, easily explains itself.\r\n\r\nAs for the organ wherewith beauty is perceived, it is the soul: the\r\nsenses only apprehend shadow-beauties—reflections and suggestions of\r\nreality. The faculty must be cultivated; it must be refined by high\r\nthinking and plain living, and at last it will see that, though Good and\r\nBeauty are one, yet Beauty is in a lower sphere than Good—is, in fact,\r\nbut an imitation of it.\r\n\r\nAll this is not merely Platonic—it is itself beautiful and good: it is\r\nnoble, it is true, it deserves everything that can possibly be said in\r\nits favour. But for the actual purposes of literary criticism it is but\r\nas a sweet song in a foreign language. It will hardly help us in the\r\nvery least degree to distinguish Shelley from the most estimable of\r\nminor poets, or Thackeray from the least estimable of minor novelists.\r\nIt does, by way of illustration, touch literary criticism once itself,\r\nfor it refers to “the admirable allegory” which represents Ulysses as\r\nusing all his efforts to withdraw himself from the enchantments of Circe\r\nand the passion of Calypso, resisting all the enticements of bodily\r\nbeauty and delight. To the greatest as to the least of Neo-Platonists\r\nthe allegorical explanation is itself Circe, itself Calypso; and instead\r\nof endeavouring to escape from it, he willing meets it willing, and\r\nabides contented in those ever-open arms.\r\n\r\nThis is especially seen in the writings, known or attributed, of the\r\nmost industrious and variously accomplished, if not the [Sidenote:\r\n_Porphyry._] most gifted, of the Neo-Platonists, Porphyry. Porphyry has\r\nto his credit two documents which, in title and subject, are undoubtedly\r\nliterary, the _Quæstiones Homericæ_ and the _De Antro Nympharum_; while\r\nsome would take away from Plutarch, and give to him, the work on Homer’s\r\nLife and Poems, which has undergone the indignity of being spoken of as\r\n“miserable” by M. Egger,[72] while, on the other hand, Archbishop\r\nTrench[73] gives the author, whoever he was, what would, if deserved, be\r\nthe very high praise of having thus early “recognised very distinctly\r\nthe charm which rhyme has for the ear.” If this were so, I should be\r\ninclined to put him together with Philostratus, as having at least\r\nstumbled on a great critical truth. But perhaps the words will hardly\r\nbear the burden, for the writer, quoting μελισσάων ἀδινάων ...\r\nἐρχομενάων, adds, “These words and their likes add much grace and\r\npleasure to the expression.”[74] And unluckily, the remark occurs only\r\nin an examination of Homer _by figures_, where this is taken as\r\nrepresenting _homoeoteleuton_. Now, _homoeoteleuton_, though it is a\r\nsort of poor relation of rhyme, belongs to that branch of the family\r\nwhich more rightly bears the name of Jingle. However this may be, the\r\ntreatise, as a whole, would scarcely add to the reputation either of\r\nPlutarch or of Porphyry.\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  _Op cit. plur._, p. 484.\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  _Sacred Latin Poetry_ (ed. 2, London, 1864), p. 30, _note_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  μάλιστα προστίθησι τῷ λόγῳ χάριν καὶ ἡδονήν.\r\n\r\nThe two more certain works, on the other hand, belong only to those\r\noutskirts of our subject which have been so often characterised. The\r\n_Questions_[75] busy themselves almost wholly with the text and the\r\nmeaning, though it is fair to say that Porphyry is much above the usual\r\nscholiast in sense and judgment, and sometimes approaches criticism\r\nproper. This approach, however, is generally, if not always, displayed\r\nin the same direction as that of Aristotle’s extant _Homeric Problems_\r\n(_v. supra_, p. 49 _sq._) and of many of the remarks made by the Master\r\nin the twenty-fifth chapter of the _Poetics_—the direction, namely, of\r\nsolving material _aporiæ_, such as Aristotle’s own comment on ζωρότερον\r\nκέραιε, and Porphyry’s[76] on the demurrer why Penelope did not send\r\nTelemachus for aid to her own parents? The process, in short,\r\nillustrates frequently, if not always, that curious _swerving_ from the\r\npurely literary question which we so often notice. Almost any magnet is\r\nstrong enough to draw the commentator away from that question. He will\r\neven ask, and gravely answer, the question, Why men, but not gods, are\r\nrepresented as washing their hands before dinner?\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  Ed. Schrader, 2 vols., Leipsic, 1890.\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  For this and the subsequent oddity see Schrader (_op. cit._, _Ad\r\n  Odysseam_), pp. 40-43. The subject is dealt with, from another point\r\n  of view, in a monograph by M. Carroll, _Aristotle’s Poetics in the\r\n  Light of the Homeric Scholia_, Baltimore, 1895.\r\n\r\nThe _De Antro Nympharum_,[77] on the other hand, is the principal\r\nexample, in intermediate times, of that allegorical interpretation or\r\nmisinterpretation which, unless kept severely in order, is sure to usurp\r\nthe place of the criticism to which it can at best be ancillary. From no\r\nother members of the school, so far as I know, have we anything that\r\ncomes even as near to criticism as this.\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  My copy of this is the separate edition of Van Goens (Trajecti ad\r\n  Rhenum, 1765). It can hardly be necessary to say that the subject is\r\n  the famous and beautiful opening of _Od._ xiii. As for the\r\n  treatment—the cave, the double entrance, the nymphs, the vases, the\r\n  bees, are all allegorised to the _n_^{th}, pressed to death, broken on\r\n  the wheel, sublimated to a non-essence in the Neo-Platonic laboratory.\r\n\r\nBut the Schools have led us far from our immediate context and subject,\r\nthe literature of the three centuries after Aristotle. [Sidenote:\r\n_Rhetoricians and Grammarians._] From all this literature it cannot be\r\nsaid that one single text, of undoubted genuineness and substantive\r\nimportance, preserves for us the critical views of the something like\r\nthree hundred years which passed between the philosopher’s death in 322\r\nB.C. and the flourishing of Dionysius of Halicarnassus in the third\r\ndecade before Christ. Two things, however, may be said to be, in a round\r\nand general manner, ascertained as having either taken definite form or\r\ncome into existence during this time; and though both are conditioned\r\nvery uncomfortably by our lack of texts, they are both of the utmost\r\nimportance to the history of Criticism, and they can both be spoken of,\r\nwith caution, indeed, but with some general induction not too far from\r\ncertainty. The one is the establishment of the teaching of Rhetoric in a\r\nform which underwent no very important modification for five or six\r\nhundred years, and no absolute revolution for fifteen or sixteen\r\nhundred. The other is the birth of Verbal Criticism—of the kind of\r\ncriticism which long arrogated to itself something like a primary title\r\nto the name, and has, in the same or other forms, not yet quite given up\r\nits pretensions—under the auspices of Aristarchus and the great\r\nAlexandrian school of commentators. The importance assigned to these can\r\nbe justified from the fact, whether that fact be or be not in itself\r\ndistasteful, that of such ancient criticism as remains to us, by far the\r\nlarger part is busied rather in these two directions than in that of\r\nCriticism proper. On the one hand, we have the huge body of work, not\r\neven so quite completely collected, which fills the seven thousand pages\r\nof Walz’s _Rhetores Græci_, and the less voluminous thesaurus which does\r\nduty for Roman effort on the same lines. On the other, we have the body\r\n(whether as great or greater its more scattered condition does not\r\npermit one to say certainly) of Scholia. And we constantly find—to our\r\ngrief—that the better writers (of whom, at least in some cases,\r\nsomething survives to us) are apt to stray, in one or other of these\r\ndirections, from the proper path of that criticism which, though it does\r\nnot neglect either Rhetorical method or verbal minuteness, yet busies\r\nitself mainly with far other questions, asking, “Is this writer or this\r\nwork, on the whole, good or bad as work or writer?” “What variety of the\r\npoetical or prosaic pleasure does he or it give?” “What are the sources,\r\nso far as they are traceable, of this pleasure?” “What is the special\r\nidiosyncrasy of the author or the book?” “What place do both hold, in\r\nrelation to other books or authors of the same or other times, in the\r\nsame or other languages?” It will not be otiose if we attempt to sketch,\r\nfrom the extant examples, what the Rhetorician and the Scholiast, as a\r\nrule, actually did, what aim they seem to have set before them, what\r\nconnection with the best literary criticism they seem to have had.\r\n\r\nWe need not very greatly disturb ourselves at the fact that, of complete\r\nRhetorical treatises, we have probably nothing between Aristotle and\r\nDionysius, if even that attributed to the latter be genuine; and that\r\nmodern investigations refuse indorsement to the genuineness of the _De\r\nInterpretatione_ attributed to Demetrius Phalereus,[78] which would, if\r\nit were genuine, be the oldest we have. For, from myriad petty\r\nindications, there is no reasonable reason for believing that a genuine\r\n_Rhetoric_ by Demetrius would be very different from that which is now\r\nattributed to some later Alexandrian writer. Rhetoric, as we have seen,\r\nhad from the first been hampered by special attributions and\r\nlimitations; nor (as so often happens in history) did these limitations\r\ncease, at any rate to some extent, to work when their causes ceased to\r\nexist. The sentry in St James’s Park, who continued to be posted till\r\nthe other day at the garden-door of a certain house, because (as it was\r\nfound out long after the reason had been forgotten) some Royal or\r\nAmbassadorial personage had been quartered there for a time generations\r\nearlier, was a great and admirable allegory—and in wiser days than our\r\nown would have remained undisturbed as such. Moreover, though the\r\npolitical importance of Rhetoric decreased, and the assemblies of Greece\r\nbecame mere parish councils; though the law courts went more and more\r\neither by fixed codes or personal influence; though philosophy became\r\n_phluaria_; Rhetoric, having once, with unconscious cunning, [Sidenote:\r\n_Rhetoric early stereotyped._] got Education practically into her hands,\r\nretained that powerful engine and all the influence that it confers. It\r\nwould seem however that, pretty early, a very mischievous process of\r\nstereotyping took place. Grammar and Logic, the companions of Rhetoric,\r\nwere to some extent saved by their having positive things to deal\r\nwith—the facts of speech and the Laws of Thought. But Rhetoric dealt\r\nwith fashion, opinion, etiquette: and except when, in the hands of\r\nsuperior persons like Dionysius and Longinus among the Greeks, like\r\nQuintilian among the Latins, it shook itself free and became the\r\nLiterary Criticism that it ought to be, it became a rather parlous\r\nthing. It early developed the disease of technical jargon, in that\r\nspecially dangerous form—recognisable perhaps in times nearer our own\r\nthan those of Demetrius or even of Hermogenes—the form of giving\r\nwantonly new meanings to common words. It elaborated an arbitrary and\r\nbaneful system of “common form”—of schemes, and types, and conventional\r\nschedules, into which, by a minimum of intellectual exertion, the orator\r\nor writer could throw what he wanted. On the one hand, it constantly\r\nincreased and multiplied the Figures; on the other hand, it invented a\r\nsystem of things called _staseis_—\"states of the case\"—which attempted\r\nto classify and stereotype the matter of the orator’s brief, just as the\r\nFigures classified and stereotyped his oratorical means of dealing with\r\nit. In other words, and to adopt the terms of literary criticism itself,\r\nthe stop-watch ruled supreme. In the more technical examples of\r\nRhetorical art, such as those of the far later but characteristic\r\nHermogenes, it is often difficult to find anything which touches\r\nliterary criticism at all. Only the greater men, as has been said, were\r\never able to break free; and the sort of scorn with which they speak of\r\ntheir predecessors—Quintilian of the figure-mongers, Longinus of\r\nCæcilius—is invaluable (especially as neither Quintilian nor Longinus\r\nseems to have been at all a bad-blooded person) as showing how irksome\r\nthe traditional Rhetoric was felt to be by men who had in them the sense\r\nof literature.\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  _V. infra_, p. 103.\r\n\r\nThe Scholiast, on the other hand, if of a less traceable creation, is of\r\nalmost equally old lineage, and he may conveniently [Sidenote:\r\n_Grammatical and Scholiastic criticism._] be dealt with, in such detail\r\nand variety as he requires, before the more formidable bulk of the\r\nSchool Rhetoricians occupies us. We have already seen, in glimpses, that\r\nthe restless curiosity of the Greeks took very early to purely\r\nphilological inquiry, to the separation and naming of parts of speech,\r\nto the codification of grammar. And it was impossible that a people\r\nfurnished with such an admirable language and so early developing\r\naccomplishment, both in music and poetry, should not, at a stage\r\nproportionately much earlier than in other cases, discover and prosecute\r\ninquiries as to Prosody. To this day, Greek grammar is, to some tastes\r\nat any rate, the only grammar which is not too arbitrary or too jejune\r\nto excite any interest. The wonderful symmetry of Greek accidence, the\r\nmazy but by no means unplanned intricacy of Greek syntax, have had power\r\nto fascinate schoolboys who, both at that age and later, were merely\r\nbored by the arbitrary niceties of Latin, and refused to accept the\r\nattempts that have been made to impose an appearance of system on the\r\nantinomianism and the compromises of English. As for Greek metre, though\r\nthe subject has not the historic interest—the interest of great yet not\r\ninexplicable changes—which belongs to the prosody of the two other\r\nlanguages just brought into comparison, it is capable of much more exact\r\nhandling. And, in particular, the peculiar structure of Greek choric\r\nverse, that hitherto unparalleled blend which unites much of the liberty\r\nof prose with the ordered charm of poetry, gave practically endless\r\noccupation to intellects which would soon have been satiated with the\r\ncomparative monotony of Latin, and which might have recoiled before the\r\napparent lawlessness of English.\r\n\r\nIt is not very certain at what precise time these two studies (or, if we\r\ntake prosody to be a part of grammar, this joint-study) began to occupy\r\nconsiderable numbers of professional students. But it must have been a\r\ntolerably early one, and by degrees the grammarian in his pure function,\r\nthe scholiast in his applied one, became recognised personages.\r\n\r\nThe profession, so to speak, may be said (according to the common\r\ntradition, but with sufficient justice) to have been formally\r\nconstituted in the third and second centuries [Sidenote: _The Pergamene\r\nand Alexandrian Schools._] before Christ, under the patronage of the\r\nsuccessors of Alexander at the courts of Pergamus and Alexandria. To\r\nthese schools belong the famous names of Zenodotus (the earliest, and\r\nbelonging partly to the third century), of Crates of Mallos, and, above\r\nall, of Aristarchus. It is, perhaps, only at first sight surprising\r\nthat, famous as the names are, they are for the most part names only.\r\nNot one single work, nor even any substantial passage of a work, by any\r\nof the three masters just mentioned, or by any of their contemporaries\r\nor near pupils, has come down to us, save in the case of one pupil of\r\nZenodotus, more famous even than his master, the grammarian\r\nAristophanes. Criticism indeed, it has been said, has, of all literature\r\nthat is really literature, the most precarious existence. Still, we know\r\na good deal about them from citations, allusions, and discussions in\r\nlater writers, while of Aristophanes of Byzantium we have a fairly\r\nconsiderable collection of fragments.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of texts, always lamentable, if not actually\r\nirremediable, is here more to be regretted than anywhere, because there\r\nis fair reason for believing that, at any rate, some of these\r\ngrammarians were critics in the full and proper sense of the term. By\r\nfar the greater part of their labours appears to have been directed to\r\nHomer, and there is no reason to contradict the general, the received,\r\nopinion that while the Pisistratean redaction is not quite certain in\r\nfact, and almost entirely unknown in nature, while it is certain that\r\neven Aristotle had before him a text differing remarkably from our own,\r\nthe Alexandrian grammarians practically produced that which we have. It\r\nis accordingly from this time that the famous and formidable\r\ncraft—science it would no doubt call itself—of textual criticism may be\r\nsaid to date; and from our information, second-hand as it is, we are\r\nenabled to recognise some types of textual critics which are not, and\r\nare never likely to be, obsolete. In Aristophanes, the spelling\r\nreformer, the practical originator of accents, it is not rash to see the\r\ngreat exemplar of the critic [Sidenote: _Their Four Masters._] of the\r\npurely philological kind, who busies himself with those literary matters\r\nwhich are most remote from literature proper, though no doubt he is a\r\nvery valuable person when he is kept in his proper place. Zenodotus\r\nstands in the same relation to the lexicographical critic, and seems\r\nalso to have been the father of all those who by “a critical text” mean\r\na text arranged at their own discretion, passages being expunged,\r\ntransposed, or corrected, not in accordance with any testimony as to\r\nwhat the author did write, but according to the critic’s idea of what he\r\nought to have written—in other words, what the critic himself would have\r\nliked him to write, or would, if he could, have written in his place.\r\nAristarchus appears to have deserved the primacy generally accorded to\r\nhim by being more wisely conservative than Zenodotus, and less tempted\r\nto stick in the letter than the lesser Aristophanes; as well as by a\r\ngeneral display, in his more literary remarks, of critical faculty\r\ngreater than was possessed by either, and infinitely greater than that\r\nof the average scholiast. While the still earlier, and at least equally\r\nfamous or notorious, name of Zoilus is of itself sufficient to show that\r\nthe critic who is merely or mainly a snarler can at least boast that he\r\nis of an ancient house.\r\n\r\nIt would be rash to deny, and even unjust to doubt, that some of these\r\nfamous critics, as well as others less known or not known at all,\r\npractised criticism in its best and widest sense, regulating texts by a\r\nsanely conservative acuteness, interpreting meanings and purpose with\r\nadaptable but not too fantastic compliance, annotating matter with\r\nintelligent erudition, and even achieving, as best they could, the\r\nexplanation of the nature and success of their author’s literary appeal,\r\nand the placing of his work in the general map of literary history. Nay,\r\nthere were actually, though our remains of them are but tantalising,\r\nliterary historians of tolerably old date. But it is possibly neither\r\npresumptuous nor ungenerous to suspect that, if we had the whole works\r\nof Aristarchus before us, we should find in him (allowing for his\r\ngrammatical tendency) at least as much shortcoming as we found, probably\r\nfar more than we found, in Aristotle from the rhetorical side. For the\r\nold disability—the absence of comparison, the possession [Sidenote: _The\r\nScholiasts on Aristophanes._] of not even a second literature for\r\npurposes of contrast—must have weighed upon Aristarchus just as it\r\nweighed upon Aristotle. And it is at any rate not uncharitable, it is\r\nmerely a plain recognition of actual fact, to say that on the great mass\r\nof Greek grammatical criticism, as it comes down to us in the so-called\r\nscholiasts, the curse of the letter does undoubtedly rest. Nothing, for\r\ninstance, is more curious than to read, from the critical point of view,\r\nthe Scholia on Aristophanes,[79] some of which are undoubtedly among the\r\noldest that we have on any author, except Homer. The commentators are\r\nirreproachable in noting the slightest grammatical peculiarity; they map\r\nout the metres with religious care. Difficulties of mere meaning they\r\ntackle with the same imperturbable seriousness, the same grave and\r\nchaste attention to duty, whether the _crux_ is a recondite “excursion\r\ninto the _blue_,” or a mystery of the kitchen and the fishmarket, or a\r\npiece of legal technicality. They give careful and useful abstracts and\r\narguments, dates now and then, sometimes not contemptible scraps of\r\nliterary history. But of literary criticism proper, of appreciation of\r\nAristophanes' ever fresh wit, of his astonishing intellectual alertness,\r\nof his wide knowledge, of his occasional bursts of magnificent poetry,\r\nthere is not one word. You may spend hours, days, weeks almost over the\r\nhuge collection; but the result will only be that, for this special\r\npurpose, page after page will be drawn blank.\r\n\r\nFootnote 79:\r\n\r\n  I do not pretend to have extensively consulted or “compulsed” the\r\n  learned and admirable labours of Mr Rutherford on this subject. But I\r\n  have taken care to refresh and confirm old familiarity with Dindorf’s\r\n  edition by reading that of Dübner with the additions in the Didot\r\n  collection.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said, “The scholia on Aristophanes are confessedly[80]\r\npoor in literary annotation. Why do you take them [Sidenote: _On\r\nSophocles._] as an example? Why not take in preference, or give in\r\naddition, one at least of those collections of scholia which the same\r\nauthorities[81] accept as richer in the matter?” Very well: let us take\r\nthose on Sophocles,[82] the admittedly richest of all. It will—or\r\ncertainly may—seem at the opening as if a more promising “pocket” had\r\nbeen struck, for the first annotation on the _Ajax_ is busy with the\r\narrangement and contents of the prologue, and its relation to what\r\nfollows; and there is a good deal of similar matter throughout the\r\ncommentary on this play at least. But when we come to read it in detail\r\nwe find that its criticism is, at its widest departure from the mere\r\nexplanatory _supellex_ of the ordinary scholiast, almost purely\r\n_theatrical_. For instance, here is the note on 66: “The introduction of\r\nAjax is persuasive; for thus the pathos of the tragedy becomes greater,\r\nthe spectators perceiving him now out of his mind, and a little later in\r\nhis senses.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 80:\r\n\r\n  See the useful and interesting, if rather widely titled, paper of Ad.\r\n  Trendelenburg, _Grammaticorum Græcorum De Arte Tragicâ Judiciorum\r\n  Reliquiæ_. Bonn: 1867.\r\n\r\nFootnote 81:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., p. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 82:\r\n\r\n  Ed. P. N. Papageorgius. Leipsic: 1888.\r\n\r\nAnd again on 112: “He speaks as in other respects yielding to the\r\ngoddess but in this opposing her, and the poet hence shows his\r\ndisposition to be haughty (since the spectators are much disposed in\r\nfavour of Ajax by his misfortunes, and all but wroth with the poet),\r\nthat Ajax may seem to suffer justly from his want of submission to the\r\ndivinity.”\r\n\r\nWe might quote the long and curious note on 134 as to the composition of\r\nthe chorus from Salaminians; the criticism of the expostulation of the\r\nsaid chorus with the conduct of the Greeks to Ajax, 158; the still odder\r\nnote on 201, as of one expounding to a very little school-child how\r\nTecmessa and the Chorus exchange information; the formal explanation, on\r\n342, why Teucer is introduced later than Tecmessa, and of the hero’s\r\nlanguage to his captive mistress; the rationale, 770, of the arrival of\r\nthe messenger; the description of the scene at 815. But the mere\r\nenumeration of such things as these should, without the expenditure of\r\nmore space, be sufficient to show what the character of this annotation\r\nis. It is not so very different in places from the elaborate stage\r\ndirections with which, for the last century, some playwrights,\r\nespecially German and Scandinavian, have been wont to assist the\r\nimagination of their readers or hearers, or their own dramatic\r\nincapacity; and even when it goes beyond this, it hardly ever goes\r\nfurther than the explanation and justification of the _action_.\r\n\r\nThe same is, I think, almost without exception the character of the\r\nrelatively considerable number of observations of a critical kind which\r\nI have noted on other plays. Sometimes they are actual directions to the\r\nactor—who is told on _Electra_ 823 that he “ought, at the moment of\r\nuttering the cry, to look up to heaven, and raise his hands”—sometimes,\r\nas on _Œdipus Tyrannus_ 141, the note is made that “this will stir the\r\ntheatre.” But always, I think,—certainly in the vast majority of\r\ncases,—the critic abstains, with a rigidity which can only come from\r\ndeliberate purpose (and this is unlikely), or from unconsciousness that\r\nthe thing is likely to be required of him, from any comments on the\r\nbeauty or appropriateness of the verse, on the idiosyncrasy of the\r\nphrase or its agreement with others, on the Sophoclean characteristics\r\nof the poetry, or even (except from the pure stage point of view) on the\r\nevolution of the characters. He has evidently learnt his Aristotle, and\r\nlooks at the action first: he has not learnt him with a sufficiently\r\nindependent intelligence to remember that even Aristotle does not look\r\nat the action only.\r\n\r\nBut the case becomes strongest when we come to what should be the\r\nstronghold of literary criticism in this quarter—the [Sidenote: _On\r\nHomer._] Scholia[83] on Homer himself. Here we have the thrice—nay,\r\nthirty times—decocted essence of the critical study of generations,\r\ncenturies, almost millennia (certainly more than one millennium), of\r\nstudy of the writer who entered into Greek life, Greek thought, Greek\r\neducation, as no book, save the English Bible, has ever entered into the\r\nlife, the thought, the education, of any other country. We have it in\r\nample bulk, of all ages, presented in that special fashion of comment on\r\ncomment, of annotated annotation, which, whatever may be its merits or\r\nwhatever may be its drawbacks, is at any rate suited to draw out\r\nexamination of the common subject from almost every point of view.\r\n\r\nFootnote 83:\r\n\r\n  Ed. Dindorf and Maass. Oxford, 6 vols., 1855-88.\r\n\r\nAnd what do we find in this? We find, of course, verbal explanation in\r\nfloods, in oceans, sometimes of the most valueless, often of the most\r\nvaluable kind. We find laborious comment on etymology (not quite so\r\noften valuable as eccentric), on grammar (invaluable often), on\r\nmythology, &c., &c., giving us what, whether it be artistically worthy\r\nor worthless, we often could not otherwise by any possibility know. We\r\nget the most painstaking, if not always the most illuminative or\r\nilluminated, discussions of the poet’s meaning, handled simply, handled\r\nallegorically, handled “this way, that way, which way you please.” Not\r\nseldom, as elsewhere (in Eustathius, for instance), we get certain\r\nreferences to Figures and the technical rules of Rhetoric, which touch\r\nthe outer skirts, the fringes, of literary criticism itself. But of that\r\ncriticism, as represented even in Dionysius, much more in Longinus, the\r\nallowance is astonishingly small. You may read page after page, volume\r\nafter volume, and find absolutely nothing, or next to nothing, of the\r\nsort. Take, for instance, the two volumes of Scholia on the _Odyssey_,\r\nas published by Dindorf—on the _Odyssey_, the very touchstone of all\r\nGreek literature for literary criticism, and one which proves the gold\r\nin Longinus at the very moment that it shows what we may think not so\r\ngolden in him. You turn and turn. Besides the matter classified above, a\r\ngreat many extremely valuable, or at worst more or less curious,\r\nthoughts meet you. You will be informed (on Od. ii. 99) that “It is\r\nnatural to women to dislike the parents of their husbands”; on vi. 137,\r\nthat “All youth is fearful because of its want of experience, but\r\nespecially female youth.” You will find examples of the puerile\r\nquibbling of Zoilus, such as that it was unlikely that exactly six\r\nsailors were taken from each ship; with the common-sense, if not much\r\nless puerile, retort that it is difficult to get ἑβδομήκοντα δύο into\r\nverse. But such things are no great windfall; and such others as the\r\nobservation, at 391 of the same book, on the poet’s wonderful faculty\r\nand daring in making the sound suit the sense, and of showing in that\r\nsound “all the sorrow of the sight,” are very rare. They still more\r\nrarely soar above observations on special points, or reach criticism of\r\ngeneral handling of the relations of one part of the story to another,\r\nof its pervading poetical quality and charm. For one note, vol. i. p.\r\n425, a little farther on, as to the variety and aptness of the Homeric\r\ncompound epithets for beasts, we shall find pages and sheets of mere\r\ntrifling. And when we get a more thoughtful examination (see, for\r\ninstance, that given as apparently Porphyry’s in the Appendix, ii. 789,\r\non the conduct of Ulysses in selecting the persons to whom he shall\r\nfirst reveal himself), it strikes one at once that these, like the\r\ncomments above cited on the _Ajax_, are comments on the _action_, on the\r\ndramatic structure, and not on the literary execution.\r\n\r\nIt is the same—it is perhaps even more the same—if we turn to the\r\n_Iliad_. The famous first words elicit naturally a good deal[84] of\r\ncomment, which has some promise. Why did he begin with “wrath,” which is\r\nan ill-sounding word? For two reasons. First, that he might purify the\r\ncorresponding part of the souls of his readers by the passions, &c.\r\nSecondly, that he might give his “praises of the Greeks” greater\r\nverisimilitude. Besides, this was the practical subject with which he\r\nwas first to deal as in a kind of tragic prologue. Then there is an odd\r\ngradation of the states of wrath itself, from ὀργὴ to μῆνις. Next, an\r\ninquiry why the poet begins with the end of the war, and so forth. This,\r\nof course, is literary criticism of a sort, but on thin and threadbare\r\nlines enough; and there is not very much even of this. The scholiasts\r\nare far more at home with accentuation and punctuation; with the endless\r\nquestion of _athetesis_ (or blackmarking, as spurious); with such\r\ntechnical ticketings as at i. 366: “The trope is _anakephalaiosis_.[85]\r\nThere are four kinds of narrative—homiletic, apangeltic, hypostatic,[86]\r\nand mixed”; or with such curiously unintelligent attempts to pin down\r\npoetic beauty as the note at i. 477 on ῥοδοδάκτυλος as a synecdoche, in\r\nwhich, by the way, even the colour-scheme seems to be misunderstood.\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:\r\n\r\n  See Dindorf’s collection, enlarged with variants at the beginning of\r\n  vol. v. by Maass.\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:\r\n\r\n  _I.e._, “recapitulation.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:\r\n\r\n  _I.e._, “in the nature of conversational address, regular history, or\r\n  argument.” But it is often very difficult to translate these\r\n  rhetorical terms exactly. _Hypostasis_ in particular is even more\r\n  elusive in rhetoric than in theology.\r\n\r\nAt the close of these remarks on the Scholiasts I must enter in a fresh\r\nform the _caveat_ which has perhaps been wearisomely iterated, but which\r\nit is better to repeat too often than to suppress even in a single place\r\nwhere its omission might mislead. I am not finding fault with these\r\nlaborious and invaluable persons for not doing what they had not the\r\nleast intention to do. I am not (Heaven forbid!) arguing for any\r\nsuperiority in the modern critic over the ancient. I am only\r\nendeavouring to show that the subjects to which modern literary\r\ncritics—who, as it seems to me, stick to their business most closely,\r\nand abstain most from metabasis ἐς ἄλλο γένος—pay most attention, were\r\nprecisely those to which ancient critics, as a matter of fact, paid\r\nleast. And this it is not only the right but the duty of the historian\r\nto point out.\r\n\r\nNor will it, I trust, while we are thus examining Miscellanea, be\r\nconsidered frivolous or superfluous to examine [Sidenote: _The Literary\r\nEpigrams of the Anthology._] that vast mass of information on Greek life\r\nand thought after the Golden Age which is called the _Greek\r\nAnthology_,[87] to see whether it can afford us any light. In this mass,\r\nwith its thousands of articles ranging from exquisite to contemptible in\r\nactual literary quality, the range of subject is notoriously as wide as\r\nthat of merit. The devotees of the Minor Muses of Hellas will “rhyme,”\r\nas we should say, anything from a riddle and an arithmetical conundrum,\r\nto Myron’s cow and the complimentary statues to the latest fashionable\r\nathlete. It would be odd, therefore, if books and authors escaped or\r\nwere ignored, and they duly appear. In the battalions of _adespota_,\r\nbesides a stray versification[88] of the rules for making iambics, and a\r\nwail[89] from some grammarian unnamed that he cannot write as well as\r\nPalladius or Palladas, we come to a considerable body[90] of literary\r\nepigrams arranged, by some one or other of the numerous ancient editors\r\nof the _Anthology_, in vaguely chronological order of subject. First, as\r\nin duty bound, come Linus and Orpheus, then a considerable batch on\r\nHomer, and then the long succession of poets and philosophers,\r\ndramatists and historians, to follow. For the most part, of course, the\r\nepigrams contain generalities and commonplaces, but with more or less of\r\nthe neatness and prettiness that we associate with the very name of the\r\n_Anthology_; sometimes they go a little closer to the matter, as in the\r\npiece (523 of Jacobs) on Erinna’s much-praised “Distaff.” As we have\r\nonly five[91] (and those not consecutive) out of the three hundred\r\nverses which this girl of nineteen years composed, it would be rash as\r\nwell as unkind to question the judgment of the epigrammatist that they\r\nare “equal to Homer.” But it may safely be said that the judgment itself\r\nis in a rudimentary style of criticism. It is natural, but rather\r\n“tell-tale,” that the critic-poets always, when they can, take some\r\nnon-literary point—Anacreon’s fondness for wine, the equality in number\r\nof the Muses and the books of Herodotus, the supposed physical and moral\r\nshortcomings of Aristotle, and the like. But sometimes they go higher.\r\nThere is plenty of spirit and sense in the epigram on Panætius for\r\npronouncing the _Phædo_ spurious,—as is well known, this idlest of\r\ncritical debauches was at least as great a favourite with the ancients\r\nas with the moderns (548). Sometimes we get valuable testimony as to\r\npopular judgments—the unfeigned admiration which was felt for Menander,\r\nthough the sounder critics might put him below Aristophanes; the mighty\r\nrepute of Aristides of Smyrna (see p. 113) who is pretty certainly _not_\r\nthe Aristides congratulated ironically in another epigram as never\r\nhaving less than seven auditors—the four walls of the room, and the\r\nthree benches in it. Perhaps Claudian is a little overparted with the\r\n“mind of Virgil and the Muse of Homer.” But all decadences are given to\r\nexaggeration of this kind; and the reviews of the closing years of the\r\nnineteenth century in England will furnish much more extravagant\r\ninstances of comparison.\r\n\r\nFootnote 87:\r\n\r\n  I use the ed. of Jacobs, Leipsic, 1794, 10 vols.

The right happy industry\r\nof Meleager appears to have helped in preserving for us no small\r\nproportion of the minor work of the great men of old. But his own\r\nquintessenced and not seldom charming pen is devoted to subjects always\r\nless solemn, and sometimes very much less worthy, than literature. These\r\nelders themselves (as indeed we should expect) meddle with literature\r\nbut rarely; while their successors, the early Alexandrians, are less\r\ncopious than we might have expected. Simmias of Thebes (perhaps not the\r\nsame who outraged[92] the feelings of neo-classic critics, from Addison\r\ndownwards, two thousand years later, by composing verse-eggs and\r\n-hatchets) has left us a couple of elegant and regular, though rather\r\nvague and slight, epigrams on Sophocles;[93] Philiscus of Miletus, who\r\nwas at least old enough to be a pupil of Isocrates, a pompous eulogium\r\nof Lysias;[94] while no less a person than Thucydides has the credit of\r\none[95] on the Third Tragedian, which if extravagant in tone is neat in\r\nexpression. Of the compliments[96] to Aristophanes and Sappho, which are\r\nsimilarly attributed to Plato, the former, with its consecration of the\r\nsoul of the great comic poet as the _temenos_ of the Graces, is far the\r\nbetter. But the nearest approach to literature among the verses\r\nattributed to Plato’s mightiest rival is a quaint bundle (no small\r\none)[97] of epitaphs on the Homeric heroes. Of course these attributions\r\nare in all cases very doubtful, and possibly not in a single one\r\ncorrect; but the fact of them for literary history remains the same.\r\n\r\nFootnote 92:\r\n\r\n  He is generally called Simmias the _Rhodian_.

Erycius of Cyzicus[98] has a\r\nspirited retort to an insulter of Homer, and a generous eulogium of\r\nSophocles—it is noteworthy that these two most unite the Anthological,\r\nas the general, suffrage. Palladas handles Homer’s dealings with\r\nwomen,[99] elsewhere[100] jests ruefully about having to sell his books,\r\neven Callimachus and Pindar, and moralises[101] the story of Circe,\r\nrather stupidly, but in a fashion for which he might find only too many\r\ncompurgators in antiquity. Pollianus[102] rallies (not disagreeably) the\r\nstealers of Homeric tags and phrases; and a certain Cyrus\r\naccomplishes[103] a mild couplet to complete his own witty conceit of\r\nerecting a statue of Pindar at a bath. The long and curious poem[104] of\r\nChristodorus Coptites on the statues in the Gymnasium of Zeuxippus\r\nnaturally has a great many literary allusions. Agathias—a somewhat major\r\nstar than most of these, and one whose pursuits earned him the special\r\nsurname of Scholasticus—has, so far as I remember, only two literary\r\nepigrams[105] on statues of Æsop and Plutarch. Another “Scholasticus,”\r\nscarcely distinguished more by the name of Thomas, announces that he\r\nhas three “stars in rhetoric”—Demosthenes, Aristides, and\r\nThucydides[106]—praising especially the pains of the first, but seeming\r\nactually to prefer the two latter. Leon, the philosopher, has a little\r\nhandful[107] of epigrams on books, chiefly of science and philosophy,\r\nand a Homeric cento not more respectable than such things usually are.\r\n\r\nFootnote 98:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., iii. 12.\r\n\r\nFootnote 99:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., iii. 117.\r\n\r\nFootnote 100:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., iii. 124.\r\n\r\nFootnote 101:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., iii. 137.\r\n\r\nFootnote 102:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., iii. 146.\r\n\r\nFootnote 103:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., iii. 160.\r\n\r\nFootnote 104:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., iii. 161-177.\r\n\r\nFootnote 105:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., iv. 16.\r\n\r\nFootnote 106:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., iv. 95.\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., iv. 97-100.\r\n\r\nThe great name of Theocritus is attached[108] to pieces, not inelegant\r\nbut very distinctly _banal_, on Anacreon, Epicharmus, Archilochus,\r\nHipponax; and that of the lesser Alcæus (not the great one of Mitylene,\r\nbut the much lesser Messenian) to some praises of Homer,[109] of\r\nHesiod,[110] and again of Hipponax. Dioscorides[111] extols Sappho,\r\ndefends the much-injured Philænis against those who (to judge from\r\nconfirmatory testimony to the same effect elsewhere) played upon her the\r\nsame ignoble trick by which a certain Frenchman, in days nearer our own,\r\ntried to blast the fair fame of Luisa Sigea of Toledo. He is\r\ncomplimentarily orthodox as to Sophocles, but not much less\r\ncomplimentary to Sositheus, of whom we know little, and to Macho, of\r\nwhom, thanks to Athenæus, we know that he exercised his wits upon\r\nputting naughty anecdotes into uncommonly pedestrian verse. An epigram\r\nof the Grammarian Crates[112] refers to the controversy on the\r\nrespective merits of Chœrilus, Antimachus, and Homer, and would have\r\nbeen very welcome if it had given us some information on that matter;\r\nbut as it is, the subject is a mere pretext to enable Crates to “talk\r\ngreasily.” Antipater of Sidon,[113] starting from the childish debate\r\nabout the birthplace of Homer, turns it into something better by his\r\nconclusion—\r\n\r\n            “Thy country is great Heaven: there was to thee\r\n            No mortal mother, but Calliope”;\r\n\r\nand he subsequently celebrates Sappho, “Erinna of few verses,” and\r\nPindar, returning to the same subjects (except Erinna) in another batch,\r\nand adding a group on Anacreon (who, as fertile in commonplaces, is a\r\nfavourite subject of the Anthologians), Stesichorus, and Ibycus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 108:\r\n\r\n  i. 98.\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:\r\n\r\n  i. 238.\r\n\r\nFootnote 110:\r\n\r\n  i. 241.\r\n\r\nFootnote 111:\r\n\r\n  i. 250-252.\r\n\r\nAt least three epigrams of a different sort rather make us regret that\r\nthere are not more of the same kind, instead of the iteration of stock\r\nphrases. The first,[114] by Herodicus of Babylon, is a smart onslaught\r\non the “fry of Aristarchus,” the “mono-syllabists” who care for nothing\r\nbut ΣΦΙΝ and ΣΦΩιΝ and ΜΙΝ and ΝΙΝ. The second,[115] by Antiphanes,\r\nhails the “busybody race” of grammarians who “dig up the roots of other\r\npeople’s muses,” with a great many more abusive but not quite\r\ninappropriate epithets and comparisons. The third,[116] by Philippus, is\r\nperhaps the best of the three, girding at the “whelps of Zenodotus” with\r\na kind of combination of the other two, which is very likely actual and\r\nintentional. Philip (_v. infra_) was a careful student of the elders of\r\nhis craft. Antipater of Thessalonica[117] has quite a group of literary\r\nepigrams. He celebrates the Nine Poetesses, takes part in the\r\nAntimachus-Homer debate, refusing the Colophonian primacy, but granting\r\nhim second rank and the praise of rough vigour (“the Hammer on the anvil\r\nof the Pierides”), &c., and honours Aristophanes. Homer once more\r\noccupies Alpheus of Mitylene[118] and Antiphilus of Byzantium,[119]\r\nwhile Philippus of Thessalonica[120] devotes a “pretty but slim”\r\ncomparison with flowers to the principal bards of the Anthology itself.\r\n\r\nFootnote 112:\r\n\r\n  ii. 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 113:\r\n\r\n  ii. 18, _sq._\r\n\r\nFootnote 114:\r\n\r\n  ii. 64.\r\n\r\nFootnote 115:\r\n\r\n  ii. 189.\r\n\r\nFootnote 116:\r\n\r\n  ii. 207.\r\n\r\nFootnote 117:\r\n\r\n  ii. 101, 102.\r\n\r\nFootnote 118:\r\n\r\n  ii. 116.\r\n\r\nFootnote 119:\r\n\r\n  ii. 157.\r\n\r\nFootnote 120:\r\n\r\n  ii. 194.\r\n\r\nThis same Philippus has also a not unhappy conceit[121] about Hipponax\r\nbidding the usual passer-by at his tomb “not wake the sleeping wasp,\r\nWhose shafts fly straight although his metres limp.” A pale addition to\r\nthe garland of Sophocles comes from the doubtless alien hand of\r\nStratyllius Flaccus,[122] and Hesiod supplies only a play on words to\r\nthe better artistry of Marcus Argentarius,[123] while the accident of\r\nour order of reading—a genuine accident—finishes a volume, and the tale,\r\nwith the marvellously lame and only epigram of a certain Pinytus[124] on\r\nno less a person than Sappho.\r\n\r\nFootnote 121:\r\n\r\n  ii. 219.\r\n\r\nFootnote 122:\r\n\r\n  ii. 240.\r\n\r\nFootnote 123:\r\n\r\n  ii. 244.\r\n\r\nFootnote 124:\r\n\r\n  ii. 264.\r\n\r\nA very thankless wretch would he be who was not grateful for any\r\nlegitimate excuse to wander once more through the length and breadth of\r\nthe enchanted gardens of the Anthology. But the reperusal can only\r\nstrengthen the opinion already formed that on the actual “evaluation of\r\nπ” in criticism the Greek mind, whether wisely or unwisely, was not\r\nstrongly set. Nothing can be clearer than that the forms, the range, the\r\netiquette, so to speak, of the compositions which are here grouped,\r\ninvited criticism in the graver way as thorough as that which Ben Jonson\r\ngives to Shakespeare, Camden, and a dozen others; in the lighter as\r\nsharp, and at the same time as piercing, as that of Piron on La\r\nChaussée. But it was not the mode, and they were not in the vein. With\r\nrare exceptions they obeyed the classical principle of taking the\r\naccepted, the obvious, the orthodox, and dressing it up in their best\r\nway. It by no means follows that they were not right; but it does follow\r\nthat they leave us a little unsatisfied. To tell us that Homer is great,\r\nSappho lofty, Sophocles perfect, Aristophanes witty, is (to use the old\r\ncomparison of George Gascoigne) to praise the “crystal eye” and the\r\n“cherry lip” of any gentle-woman. And so we may turn to the division of\r\nGreek literature most opposite to the Anthology itself.\r\n\r\nBefore considering in some, at least, representative detail the vast and\r\narid province of the technical Greek Rhetoric, it may be [Sidenote: _The\r\nRhetoric of the Schools._] well, or rather is absolutely necessary, to\r\nresume the consideration of what Rhetoric really meant. As we have seen,\r\nit was at the beginning a strictly practical Art of Persuasion by\r\nOratory; and if it tended to embrace and absorb all or most other arts\r\nand sciences, this was partly because the orator would certainly have to\r\ndeal with many, and might have to deal with all, of these, partly\r\nbecause it was always more or less a political art, an art of public\r\nbusiness. For the Greek politician, like others, was expected to be a\r\nJack-of-all-trades.\r\n\r\nBut even while this practical object continued, the Greek passion for\r\nabstracting and refining tended to turn practice into theory, while the\r\nGreek love of sport, competition, public display, tended further to turn\r\nthis theory into the code of a very elaborate game. Obviously enough, as\r\nthe practical importance of oratory declined, the technical and\r\n“sporting” interest of Rhetoric got more and more the upper hand.\r\nRhetoricians specialised their terminology, multiplied their\r\nclassifications, and drew their rules ever finer and finer, just as\r\ncroquet-players narrow their hoops and bulge out their balls, just as\r\nwhist-players split and wire-draw the broad general principles of the\r\nplay of Deschapelles and Clay into “American leads,” and an endless\r\nreverberation of “calls” and “echoes.” We possess a very large, and a\r\nmore curious than interesting, collection of the technical writings of\r\nthis half craft, half sport, and a collection, rather less in\r\nproportion, but a little more interesting, of examples of the finished\r\nhandiwork or game. To both of these we must now turn, premising that the\r\ntechnical part has not very much, and the finished examples surprisingly\r\nlittle, to furnish to the stricter literature of our subject. Why, then,\r\ndo we deal with it? Because even abused Rhetoric is always Literary\r\nCriticism in a more or less degraded and disguised condition. The\r\ndegradation can be remedied, the disguise thrown off, whenever the hour\r\nand the man arrive. Rhetoric, in her worst moods, keeps the tools ready,\r\nkeeps them almost too sharply ground, if she does not put them to the\r\nright use.\r\n\r\nAs Rhetoric preserved her authority not merely to the latest classical\r\ntimes but right through the Middle Ages, and even at [Sidenote: _Its\r\ndocuments._] the close of the latter escaped, at the cost only of some\r\nminor changes and additions, the decay which fell upon the rest of\r\nScholastic learning, it is not surprising that the _Rhetores Græci_\r\nreceived early attention from the young art of Printing. Had not Aldus,\r\nin 1508-1509, collected them in two folio volumes, it is perhaps rather\r\nunlikely that we should have had any more modern collections at all. For\r\ntechnical Rhetoric fell into even more disfavour than Logic with the\r\nrise of physical science and materialist philosophy in the seventeenth\r\ncentury; and though, in some applied senses of the word, it has never\r\nfallen into complete disuse, it has never, as Logic has, recovered\r\nposition in its stricter and more formal forms. It was therefore no\r\nsmall feat, even of German industry, when, some seventy years ago,\r\nChristian Walz of Tübingen undertook a new edition,[125] which, though\r\nsome additions and improvements have since been made by Spengel[126] and\r\nothers, remains the main standard and thesaurus. Its ten stout volumes,\r\nof some seven thousand closely printed pages, have probably been read\r\nthrough, and line by line, by hardly a single person for each decade of\r\nthe seven during which it has been before the world. For not only is the\r\nbulk enormous, but the matter is extremely technical; there is endless\r\nrepetition, commentaries on commentaries on commentaries forming no\r\nsmall part of the whole, while the minute definition and special\r\nterminology[127] require extremely careful reading. I shall not pretend\r\nto have read every word of it myself; but I have read a very great deal\r\nof it, and everything that follows can be guaranteed as drawn at first\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nFootnote 125:\r\n\r\n  9 vols. (really 10, vol. vii. being in two large parts), Stuttgart,\r\n  Tübingen, London and Paris, 1832-36.\r\n\r\nFootnote 126:\r\n\r\n  Spengel’s handy collection (3 vols., 4 parts), which has now been for\r\n  some years in process of re-editing in the _Bibliotheca Teubneriana_\r\n  by Römer and Hammer, omits the scholia on Hermogenes, but includes\r\n  divers all-important, if elsewhere accessible, texts, such as\r\n  Aristotle and Longinus, and adds some minor things.\r\n\r\nFootnote 127:\r\n\r\n  It is not, I hope, illiberal to remark that our excellent “Liddell &\r\n  Scott” is perhaps more to seek in rhetorical terminology than anywhere\r\n  else. (At least it certainly was so up to the 7th or penultimate\r\n  edition: I have not yet worked with that of 1896.) Ernesti’s _Lexicon\r\n  Technologiæ Græcorum Rhetoricæ_ (Leipsic, 1795) is, for all its 105\r\n  years, still almost indispensable to the student, more so even than\r\n  the corresponding and somewhat younger Latin volume (Leipsic, 1797).\r\n  Even these fail sometimes.\r\n\r\nThe original treatises of the collection form its smallest part, and\r\nnone of them is very early; indeed, of the earlier formal Rhetoric, as\r\nhas been said, Aristotle is almost our only representative, though,\r\nluckily, he is worth all the others. If the περὶ ἑρμηνείας, or _De\r\nInterpretatione_, which goes by the name of Demetrius, had been rightly\r\nreferred (in accordance with nearly all the MSS., as far as the name\r\ngoes, and with the assent of so distinguished and acute a scholar as\r\nPetrus Victorius in regard to the person) to Demetrius of Phalerus,—the\r\nAthenian statesman and orator of the latter half of the fourth century\r\nB.C., the antagonist of his namesake the City-Taker and lover of Lamia,\r\nthe scholar of Theophrastus, the schoolfellow of Menander, the probable\r\nconsulting founder of the Alexandrian library—its interest of authorship\r\nwould be only inferior to that of the work of the greatest writers. But\r\nthe allusions and citations in the treatise itself (unless we suppose it\r\nto have been edited and interpolated to an extent such as to make it\r\nuseless as a document) are such as to put this attribution out of the\r\nquestion. And while Dionysius and others have been put forward as\r\npossible claimants, there seems no reason to doubt that the most\r\nprobable author is to be found in some Alexandrian grammarian or sophist\r\nof the name of Demetrius (perhaps the one actually named by Diogenes\r\nLaertius as having written rhetorical treatises), who may have lived\r\nunder the Antonines. There is, therefore, no reason for disturbing\r\nWalz’s actual order.[128]\r\n\r\nFootnote 128:\r\n\r\n  He does not give, but Spengel does, the _Rhetoric to Alexander_ (v.\r\n  _sup._, p. 17 _note_), attributed to Anaximenes; and the same is the\r\n  case with a short fragment, Περὶ ἐρωτήσεως καὶ ἀποκρίσεως, which is an\r\n  excursus on Arist., _Rhet._, iii. 18. It is purely _barristerial_.\r\n\r\nHis first volume is composed of divers more or less original treatises,\r\nwhich are of the kind called προγυμνάσματα, “Preliminary Exercises,” and\r\nwhich in most cases actually bear that title. The first is by the famous\r\nHermogenes (_ob._ _c._ 170 A.D.), the Phœnix of rhetoricians pure and\r\nsimple, who became a master at fifteen and an idiot at five-and-twenty,\r\nwhose “heart was covered with hair,” and whose works not only followed\r\nhim, but were followed by libraries-full of scholiasts and commentators.\r\nThe next, itself a sort of adaptation of Hermogenes, is by Aphthonius of\r\nAntioch, a teacher of the beginning of the fourth century A.D., who had\r\nthe rather curious good fortune not merely to secure a long vogue in the\r\nlate classical ages, but to be current in the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies. Theon, an Alexandrian, but not the father of Hypatia,\r\nfollows, with the less-known names of Nicolas, Nicephorus, Adrian,\r\nSeverus, and the better known George Pachymeres, as well as another\r\ncollection by an anonym. Of these, the works attributed to Adrian and\r\nSeverus are not called προγυμνάσματα, but in the first case μελέται, in\r\nthe second διηγήματα καὶ ἠθοποΐαι.[129] The most famous and popular of\r\nthe sets, those of Hermogenes and Aphthonius, are very short, and, like\r\nthat of Georgius Pachymeres, do not exceed fifty pages. The others are\r\nlonger, and in the case of the work of Nicolas, some three times as\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nFootnote 129:\r\n\r\n  _Meletæ_ are properly “complete declamations,” not, as are the\r\n  _Progymnasmata_, exercises in _parts_ of oratory, The others are some\r\n  of these parts only.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Progymnasmata of Hermogenes is a curious and slightly\r\nbewildering mixture of definition, literary [Sidenote: _The_\r\nProgymnasmata _of Hermogenes_.] history, and the kind of “Manual for\r\nYoung Writers” (_lege_ orators), which, after long disuse, has recently\r\nbegun to be prepared for the aspiring journalist. The first chapter is\r\non Fables. They are supposed to be good things for the young. They have\r\nvarious authors and titles, but there is a tendency to give the name of\r\nÆsop to all of them. They are not true to fact; but should be plausible,\r\nand can be made so by suiting the action to the characters and making\r\nthe peacock stand for beauty and vanity, the fox for wisdom, the ape for\r\nmimicry. Sometimes you should give them shortly, sometimes spin them\r\nout. (Example given.) You may put them in different places of your\r\nspeech, and they will do instead of an actual example.\r\n\r\nThe second chapter is of Narration (διήγημα), which is distinguished\r\nfrom Fable as being the story of something which has either actually\r\nhappened or is told as if it had. Homer and Herodotus are both\r\n“narrators.” There are five kinds of it (one thinks of Polonius)—the\r\ndirectly declaratory, the indirectly ditto, the elenchtic, the loose,\r\nthe periodic—with examples of each kind.[130] The first is good for\r\nstory, the second for debate, “the elenchtic [confuting] is rather for\r\nelenchs,” and the loose for epilogues, as being pathetic.\r\n\r\nFootnote 130:\r\n\r\n  This is an early example of the confusion and cross-division which has\r\n  infested formal Rhetoric to the present day. For the first three heads\r\n  are purely material, the last two grammatical-formal; so that, instead\r\n  of ranking side by side, _each_ of 1, 2, 3 should rank under _each_ of\r\n  4, 5. Cf. Professor Bain’s _Rhetoric_, vol. i., where similar\r\n  cross-division more than once occurs.\r\n\r\nWe might at very little expense of trouble, if at much of space, go\r\nthrough the whole of the little treatise and show how the\r\nhairy-hearted one of Tarsus deals in the same way with “Uses,”[131]\r\nMaxims, Refutation and Confirmation, Commonplace, Encomium,\r\nComparison, Character-drawing,[132] Ecphrasis,[133] Thesis,[134] and\r\nIntroduction. But the examples given will suffice. Each chapter\r\nconsists of a definition, a division, sometimes very finely drawn, of\r\nkinds, examples, and generally a scrap of advice as to how, when, and\r\nwhere to introduce them.\r\n\r\nFootnote 131:\r\n\r\n  χρεῖαι, rather “maxims” than “uses” in the theological sense.\r\n  Hermogenes exhausts his special gift in distinguishing them from the\r\n  more general maxim or γνώμη.\r\n\r\nFootnote 132:\r\n\r\n  The ἠθοποΐια above referred to. It has a special reference to the\r\n  drawing-up of speeches suitable to such and such a character in such\r\n  and such a situation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 133:\r\n\r\n  Description of the graphic and picturesque kind.\r\n\r\nFootnote 134:\r\n\r\n  Subject or question in the wide sense.\r\n\r\nThe good and the evil of this kind of thing, as well as its special\r\nbearings on literary criticism, are not difficult to discern. [Sidenote:\r\n_Remarks on them._] It necessitates the narrowest and most accurate\r\ninvestigation of the kinds and characteristics of literature, of\r\nliterary means, of “composition,” in the wide and the narrow sense. It\r\nconfers on apt students, besides the mere ability to play the special\r\ngame of artificial oratory, a great acuteness of analysis. It entirely\r\navoids, no doubt, the danger which is charged constantly, and sometimes\r\nnot without a certain justice, on the more æsthetic kind of literary\r\nstudy and literary criticism—the danger of desultory chatter. It has, in\r\nshort, though to a less degree, the virtues of Formal Logic. And if the\r\nsubject of Education, and fresh nostrums in it, were not a weariness to\r\nall intelligent mankind, one might say that not a few things in our\r\npresent curricula might with advantage be excluded to make room for a\r\ncourse (with some due alterations) of Rhetoric according to Hermogenes.\r\nBut, at the same time, its own shortcomings and its own dangers are\r\nequally obvious. The greatest of them—indeed one which in a manner\r\nswallows up and contains within itself all the others—is the almost\r\nirresistible temptation to regard literature as something according to\r\nscheme and schedule, something that the pocket ivory rule of the\r\narchitect, and his neatly latticed paper, and a short handbook like this\r\nbefore us, will enable you to despatch and dispose of. Acute as are the\r\ndivisions and definitions, they are dead things; and nothing that\r\nimitates and follows them can be really alive.\r\n\r\nAphthonius adopts the same divisions of Progymnasmata, save that he\r\nmakes them fourteen instead of twelve, by [Sidenote: _Aphthonius._]\r\nseparating ἀνασκευὴ [rebutting] from κατασκευὴ [confirming], and adding\r\na section on Blame. His object was evidently to make even the\r\nbusiness-like handling of his predecessor more precise still; and the\r\nlong and revived popularity which, as has been said, he achieved, was\r\nnot an undue reward for one of the most craftsmanlike crambooks that\r\never deserved the encomium of the epithet and the discredit of the noun.\r\nAphthonius substitutes for the simple heading “Of Myth,” &c.,\r\n“_Definition_ of Myth,” &c.; and though he still keeps his sections very\r\nshort, he manages, instead of the rather brachygraphic indication of\r\nexamples in the text, to give an appendix of complete if miniature\r\npattern at the end of each section—a fable of the ants and grasshoppers,\r\nurging youth to industry, for the first; the story of the rose and its\r\nacquiring redness from the blood of Aphrodite when she struck her foot\r\nagainst its thorns in trying to shield Adonis from Ares, for the second;\r\nand so on. In every respect, Aphthonius has studied clearness, and he\r\nhas certainly achieved it. If it were not for the dangers of the whole\r\nmethod, and especially that greatest one, of encouraging the mistake of\r\nclassification for fact, terms for things, orderly reference to a\r\nschedule for æsthetic appreciation, he would deserve very hearty\r\napplause. And even as it is, one could, as has been said above, see the\r\nstudy which he facilitates substituted for any one of at least a dozen\r\nsubjects of our modern overcrowded curriculum with a great deal of\r\nequanimity. Short as the piece is, some of the examples, such as the\r\nencomia of Thucydides and of Wisdom, are compositions of considerable\r\nfinish. But it is significant that in the first there is, strictly\r\nspeaking, no literary criticism at all, and that even the inevitable\r\ncomparison with Herodotus is poorly shuffled off with the stock reproach\r\nthat Herodotus writes to please, Thucydides to speak the truth.\r\n\r\nTheon, with greater space at his command, employs a different method. It\r\nis uncertain whether he preceded or followed [Sidenote: _Theon._]\r\nAphthonius; but the former theory is favoured by the fact that he, like\r\nHermogenes, has twelve subjects only, those which Aphthonius put asunder\r\nbeing still united. He begins with a general disquisition on, and\r\nencomium of, the Progymnasmata, widening them somewhat, so as to bring\r\nin Figures to some extent, but also describing some of these as\r\n“contentious” or “disputed.” Then he has a rather curious chapter,\r\nnearer to our special purpose than usual, showing how, not merely the\r\ngreat orators, but the great writers of old, used these forms, or rather\r\nthings which can be brought under these forms, citing the famous speech\r\nof Sophocles as to his emancipation from love in the _Republic_, the\r\nfable of the flute-player in Herodotus, others in other historians, and\r\na very great many more things, not a few of which are lost. This\r\nenumeration is not only interesting as pointing to these _desiderata_,\r\nbut as showing how unhappy the Greek was unless he could arrange and\r\nclassify and ticket, as well as, distinguish and enjoy, the parts and\r\ncharacteristics of literature. The spirit is not dead yet: it has\r\nprompted a much-respected living author on Rhetoric to describe _In\r\nMemoriam_ as “a combined Hyperbole of Affection and Sorrow.” And this\r\nmay undoubtedly be said in its favour, that its exercise does really\r\nrequire and promote a certain intellectual alertness and activity. But\r\nthe question is, Do this alertness and this activity exert themselves in\r\nactual progress, or in mere marking-time? Is the comprehension (one can\r\nhardly even ask Is the enjoyment) of _In Memoriam_ furthered by its\r\norderly arrangement in the case generally labelled “Hyperbole,” and in\r\nthe compartment labelled “Combined Hyperboles,” and in the further\r\npigeon-hole labelled “Of Affection and Sorrow”? Is it really important\r\nto decide whether Sophocles’s variation on “sour grapes” is a χρεία or\r\nan apophthegm, and which are the most remarkable examples of διήγημα in\r\nthe orators and the historians respectively? Such things may appear to\r\nsome specially and fatally to underlie the Platonic curse on the\r\nappearance of knowledge without the reality. But they have, as we see,\r\nvery strong and long prescription, and there are still some who bitterly\r\nresent the exclusion of them from the teaching, not merely of technical\r\nRhetoric, but of literature—who regard a system of “leaden rules,” of\r\nindividual appreciation without classes and compartments and\r\nindorsements, as dilettante, unscientific (which it would certainly\r\nallow itself to be), and effeminate. Between the two, opinion, a little\r\nassisted by Logic and History, must be left to decide.\r\n\r\nTheon’s handling of the Progymnasmata (which he often speaks of without\r\nthe _pro_) is, as has been said, much fuller than those of Hermogenes\r\nand Aphthonius. He does not, like the latter of these, give a regular\r\nformal pattern of each kind; but he has a great many illustrative\r\nreferences to literature, and he has a good deal of discussion on what\r\nmay be called the philosophy of the several kinds. Nor is it\r\nunnoteworthy that in dealing with Commonplace he drops the “common,”\r\nsubstitutes _prosopopœia_ for _ethopœia_, and introduces the\r\ncurious new heading of “Law.” On the whole, Theon is more “for thoughts”\r\nthan either of his forerunners;[135] he might profit a clever boy more,\r\nand he has much more numerous and deeper glimmerings of insight into the\r\npurely critical side of the matter. But he lacks system, and this, in\r\ndealing with a subject which is systematic or nothing, is a drawback.\r\n\r\nFootnote 135:\r\n\r\n  Speaking of Walz’s order: I have little doubt myself that he preceded\r\n  Aphthonius in time.\r\n\r\nThere was a rhetorical Nicolaus (indeed the name was very common) who\r\nwas a student of Proclus; but the author of the [Sidenote: _Nicolaus._]\r\n_Progymnasmata_ we possess seems to have flourished later, under the\r\nEmperor Leo and after him. For some reason or none, MSS. of him seem to\r\nbe specially found at Oxford. They are merely examples, several of each\r\nkind, and sometimes minutely subdivided, there being, for instance,\r\nseparate patterns of mixed, unmixed, logical, and practical “Use.” They\r\nform, in fact, a curious bundle, and by no means a very small one, of\r\npartial declamations in common form, the examples of _Ethopœia_ being\r\nespecially remarkable: “What sort of things Niobe would say,” “What\r\nMenœceus the patriotic suicide,” “What Cassandra at the sight of the\r\nhorse,” &c. No less than fourteen in all are given.\r\n\r\nThis is also the principle of the _Progymnasmata_ of Nicephorus\r\nBasilicus, a notary (not the son-in-law chronicled by [Sidenote:\r\n_Nicephorus._] Scott) of Alexius Comnenus, who gives no less than\r\nthree-and-twenty Ethopœiæ on subjects Pagan and Christian. In fact,\r\nthese two collections, which together fill some two hundred and fifty\r\nwell-packed pages, may be regarded rather as rhetorical reading-books,\r\ndesignedly intended to possess a certain interest, than as anything\r\nelse. Familiarity with them would be likely to produce much the same\r\nsort of literary facility, and in a sense “correctness,” as that which\r\nwe find in the minor French writers of the eighteenth century. It could,\r\nafter mere childhood (when it might insensibly inculcate some good\r\nprinciples and some sound models), have little other good effect.\r\n\r\nThe few μελέται of Adrianus, the successor and funeral eulogist of\r\nHerodes Atticus, are whole declamations, not [Sidenote: _Minors._]\r\nbrought under any of the heads. The _Diegemata_ and _Ethopœiæ_ of\r\nSeverus, after what has been said of these kinds, will need no special\r\ncharacterisation; and the _Progymnasmata_ of George Pachymeres (who was\r\nnearly contemporary with Dante) and of the Anonymus are, like so many of\r\nthe others, pure examples, indeed (as the former are well called in one\r\nMS.) _Meletæ_ on the Progymnasmata themselves.\r\n\r\nNo great resumption or amplification of the scattered comments already\r\nmade on these works can be necessary. They form a by no means\r\ncontemptible group of \"Composition [Sidenote: _General remarks on the\r\nProgymnasmata._] books,\" creditably distinguished from some more modern\r\nexamples of the same kind by being busy with something better than mere\r\ngrammar, but not as a rule showing any of that conception of style which\r\nis visible as early as Dionysius, distinct in Quintilian, and present in\r\na form at once vigorous and exquisite in Longinus. They are by no means\r\nill calculated to excite an interest in literature, and even to\r\nfacilitate the production, in not contemptible form, of certain kinds of\r\nit. But there is upon all of them the curse of beginning at the wrong\r\nend—of constructing an elaborate skeleton system of forms, and kinds,\r\nand sub-kinds, and then classifying literature under these, instead of\r\nbeginning with the literature, separating the good from the bad, and\r\nexamining, as far as may be possible, the sources of goodness and\r\nbadness. A man trained in them would have many advantages over our\r\nheaven-born, but hardly even earth-instructed, reviewers and students of\r\nliterature. But he would be very apt to miss the finer touches, to lose\r\nthe nobler gusts, of literature; and he would be especially disposed\r\ntowards that worst disease of criticism, so often manifested in its\r\nhistory, which leads men to ignore, or even blaspheme, great work,\r\nbecause it refuses to be classified, or to obey the arbitrary rules\r\nwhich have been foisted into, or encrusted upon, the classification.\r\n\r\nNot from such a point of view did the still later teachers, who set\r\nthemselves to comment on the comment of Hermogenes [Sidenote: _The\r\nCommentaries on them._] and Aphthonius, regard their authorities. The\r\nsecond volume of Walz—a stout one of nearly seven hundred pages—is\r\nentirely occupied with scholia on Aphthonius alone, at the rate, that is\r\nto say, of about fourteen pages of margent to one of text. This flood of\r\nwords about words has been too much for the patience even of the editor,\r\nwho gives specimens only of some, and in just wrath labels one as “a\r\nfutile opuscule botched together with utter stupidity.” Much, indeed, is\r\nof the usual kind which we associate with _scholia_—verbal\r\ninterpretation, sometimes not useless, but as a rule singularly\r\npedestrian and uninspired, introduced with a monotonous rattle of\r\n_clichés_ and catchwords. But there are also better things, and the\r\nso-called “Homilies” of Doxopater, besides being of very considerable\r\nbulk (they fill some four hundred pages, not of mere scrappy annotation\r\nbut of substantive commentary), attest the intelligence as well as the\r\nindustry of their author, a Byzantine of the eleventh century. But they\r\nare (necessarily, no doubt) cribbed and cabined by the circumscriptions\r\nof their text.\r\n\r\nIn the third volume we return to comparatively original work, with\r\nHermogenes once more at the head of the authors. [Sidenote: _The \"Art\"\r\nof Hermogenes._] We have left the vestibule—the Progymnasmata—and are\r\nnow in the main courts of pure Rhetoric herself. Much more than half the\r\nvolume is occupied by the four divisions of the master’s _Technic_: the\r\nfirst of “_Staseis_,” the second, in four parts, of “Inventions,” the\r\nthird of “Ideas,” and the fourth of “Cleverness[136] of Method.” One\r\nsynopsis of about a hundred pages, an anonymous epitome of fifty, with\r\neleven shorter epitomes, and other tractates, scarcely averaging a dozen\r\npages each, complete the volume.\r\n\r\nFootnote 136:\r\n\r\n  δεινὸς and δεινότης are good examples of the difficulty of getting\r\n  exact English equivalents for Greek rhetorical terms. Some prefer\r\n  “vehemence” or “intensity,” but neither of these will suit\r\n  universally. The word seems to refer to the orator’s power of suiting\r\n  his method to his case, to alertness and fertility of resource.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the manual of Hermogenes is the text-book of\r\nlater Greek Rhetoric. Five mortal volumes of Walz, one of nearly nine\r\nhundred pages, are occupied by scholia upon it, two of these being\r\ndevoted to the _Staseis_ alone; and it seems to have been the model\r\nsubject even of those who did not ostensibly range themselves as its\r\ncommentators. The book of the _Staseis_, which produced fifteen hundred\r\npages of extant and printed commentary, has itself but fifty or sixty,\r\nthe great bulk of the treatise being contained under the heads of\r\n“Inventions” and “Ideas.” There is a table of contents, but it may be\r\nfeared that this will be of but partial service to any one not\r\nacquainted with the technicalities of the subject. Others may indeed be\r\nrelieved by the names of well-known Greek orators and historians, who\r\nappear to be discussed under “Ideas,” and even by those of some commonly\r\nknown Figures in the last division. But on the whole Terminology revels\r\nin all her wildest Greek luxuriance. Hypodiæresis and Prodiegesis guard\r\nthe labyrinth with Antenclema and Procatastasis[137] ready at hand; more\r\nfamiliar words have obviously assumed new senses; and it is not even the\r\nvery easiest thing to acquire a distinct and satisfactory idea of the\r\nconnotation of the great section-headings themselves, while, when that\r\nidea is at last attained, we may find that it is for our special purpose\r\nirrelevant, or nearly so.\r\n\r\nFootnote 137:\r\n\r\n  “Distribution of the indictment”; “preliminary statement”;\r\n  “acknowledgment with justification”; “introduction to narrative,” are\r\n  attempts at Englishings of these.\r\n\r\nThe best instance stands, at the very threshold of the investigation, in\r\nthe very name of those _Staseis_ which, as we have seen, attracted the\r\ncommentators as a candle does flies. Στάσις is a term which appears\r\nimpossible to translate into any single English word, even in that legal\r\nvocabulary to which (far more than to anything having to do with\r\nliterature) it really belongs. Its Latin equivalent is _status_ or\r\n_constitutio_:[138] M. Egger renders it in French as _état de cause_;\r\nLiddell and Scott do not attempt to render it at all; but it and its\r\nLatin equivalents have been variously translated as “state of the case,”\r\n“issue,” “point.” Sometimes it seems as if it might be not impossibly\r\ntranslated “plea.” Hermogenes (who plunges at once, after his fashion,\r\ninto a wilderness of the most wiredrawn distinctions) gives no general\r\ndefinition, but says that στάσις ὁρικὴ is “the search for a name for a\r\nthing,” and instances the case of a man who has stolen the private\r\nproperty of a priest. Is this Sacrilege or Theft? The opening for\r\nhair-splitting which such an inquiry gives is, of course, a very wide\r\none, and Hermogenes simply revels in the indulgence thereof. But for us\r\nthere is hardly a blade of pasture in the field on which centuries of\r\ncommentators browsed so greedily.\r\n\r\nFootnote 138:\r\n\r\n  Quintilian adds _quæstio_ and _quod in quæstione appareat_ to these,\r\n  and explains στάσις itself as so called _vel ex eo quod ibi sit primus\r\n  causæ congressus vel quod in hoc causa consistat_. The kinds and\r\n  sub-kinds of στάσεις were luxuriously wallowed in: and ὁρικὴ, and\r\n  στοχαστικὴ, _negotialis_ and _comparativus_, with a dozen others, can\r\n  be investigated by those who choose.\r\n\r\nΕὑρέσις again may be “for thoughts.” Again we can find no single word\r\nfor them, how much less for such niceties as _procatastasis_ and\r\n_prodiegesis_? The term covers the additions to the case introduced by\r\nthe speaker’s own invention, and ranges over a vast variety of\r\nsubtleties, ending with a treatment of some Figures. The examination of\r\n“Ideas”[139] shifts to the qualities of the speech or speaker—clearness,\r\npurity, dignity, energy, brilliancy, and very many others, ending with\r\nthat survey of great speakers and writers which has been noted. And\r\nfinally the treatise on “Cleverness of method” contains, not only more\r\nfigures, but a profusion of mostly brief and rather desultory cautions.\r\nThroughout the book the author seems in a sort of paroxysm of\r\ndistinction and nomenclature: he is always striving to make out some one\r\nthing to be at least two things, and to fit each of the two with some\r\ntechnological form.\r\n\r\nFootnote 139:\r\n\r\n  In the sense, of course, of “kind,” not of “notion.” Indeed one\r\n  Scholiast on Hermogenes defines it as ποιότης λόγου τοῖς ὑποκειμένοις\r\n  ἁρμόδιος προσώποις τε καὶ πράγμασιν.\r\n\r\nWe turn, naturally enough, to the dealings with great writers mentioned\r\nabove to see what this method, of analysis pushed to the verge of mania,\r\nwill give us. They are very short—not in all filling twenty pages—and,\r\nas we might have expected, they contain little more than simple\r\nreference to the technicalities on which so much time has been spent.\r\nLiterary criticism, in short, becomes a form of chemical analysis. We\r\nall know how this runs, as posted up, say, outside the walls of a\r\npump-room. The water contains iron so many grains, sulphur so much,\r\nchlorine so much, nitrates a trace, and so forth. So here. Lysias has\r\nmoderate ἐπιμέλια, only a trace of γοργότης, a certain amount of\r\nπεριβολή κατ’ ἔννοιαν, but hardly any of it κατὰ μέθοδον, very little\r\nthat is axiomatic, but a great deal of cleverness of method. On the\r\nother hand, Isæus has a great deal of γοργότης,[140] more abundant\r\nἐπιμέλεια, and so with other things. He is not so good as Demosthenes\r\n(who, be it observed, is Hermogenes' ideal), but much better than\r\nLysias, though he has not so much clearness of method, yet still a good\r\ndeal. Of the historians, Xenophon is very particularly ἀφελὴς and also\r\n“sweet,” &c., &c.\r\n\r\nFootnote 140:\r\n\r\n  Generally rendered “nervousness,” though Ernesti prefers “celerity.”\r\n  is “diligent exactness”; περιβολὴ κατ' ἔννοιαν, “argumentative\r\n  exaltation of the subject”; ἀφελὴς is “simple.” By this time, and\r\n  indeed long before, a regular cant of criticism had sprung up. Mr\r\n  Nettleship once made a useful list of its terms (_v. infra_, bk. ii.\r\n  p. 219).\r\n\r\nPerhaps the following sentence may serve as well as any other as an\r\nexample of the method of Hermogenes. It is from the fourth chapter of\r\nthe third book, περὶ εὑρέσεων:—\r\n\r\n“Since many have set out many things about epicheiremes[141] and have\r\nspent much speech on this, and nobody has been able to bring it home to\r\nthe mind clearly, I shall endeavour, as clearly as I can, to decide what\r\nis the invention of the epicheireme which constructs the _kephalaion_ or\r\nthe _lusis_, and what the invention of the _ergasia_ which constructs\r\nthe _epicheireme_, and what the invention of the enthymeme which\r\nconstructs the _ergasia_.” I quote this with none of that ignorant scorn\r\nof terminology, as such, which authorities so different as Hamilton and\r\nMill have justly denounced in reference to the common eighteenth-century\r\njudgments of the schoolmen. But it will be obvious to anybody that this\r\nkind of writing tends to the construction of a sort of spider’s web of\r\nwords, the symmetry and exactness of construction whereof are in inverse\r\nratio to substance and practical use. It may catch flies; it undoubtedly\r\ngives a sense of ingenuity and mastery to the spider. But it has\r\nextremely little sweetness: it rather obstructs the light: and it is not\r\ncapable of being put (for it will not even staunch wounds) to any of\r\nthose practical purposes which objects possessing very little sweetness,\r\nand no light at all, not unfrequently subserve.\r\n\r\nFootnote 141:\r\n\r\n  A peculiar form of enthymeme, falling short of complete demonstration.\r\n  ἐργασία is “handling” or “workmanship,” with a special connotation.\r\n\r\nWe shall still have something to say of Hermogenes when we come to the\r\nconclusion of this Rhetorical matter; but for the [Sidenote: _Other\r\n“Arts,” &c._] present it is necessary to pass on to the writers\r\nassociated with him in this third volume of Walz. The _Art of Rhetoric_\r\nof Rufus, whose age and identity are quite unknown, is a very brief and\r\nrather slight skeleton, with classifications, definitions of terms, and\r\na few examples. Perhaps the most interesting thing about it is the\r\naddition of a fourth kind—historic—to the usual three—forensic, and\r\nsymbouleutic, and epideictic. The very common habit, to which reference\r\nhas been already made, of taking examples almost indiscriminately from\r\norators and historians, has evidently a logical connection (whether of\r\ncause or effect) with this. An anonymous “Synopsis” is busied with\r\nHermogenes only. Joseph the Rhacendyte, who seems to have been a\r\nthirteenth-century man and a native of the “little isle” of Ithaca, is\r\nmuch fuller, has written an argument of his book in about 150 iambic\r\ntrimeters, of a kind which would bring severe tribulation on the British\r\nschoolboy, and is noteworthy (though he would be more so if it were not\r\nfor his late day) because he has evidently reached the stage where\r\nRhetoric is recognised as the Art of Literature. His chapter-headings\r\nhave the curious confusion and jumble which characterises much, if not\r\nmost, Rhetoric since the strict oratorical side was lost sight of,—he\r\nhas one on epistolary writing, one even on verse: and from several\r\npoints of view his interest is not infinitesimal. It is very far from\r\nsuperfluous to note, though it may be impossible to discuss in detail,\r\nthe significance of the fact that while another Anonym gives us four\r\nparts of a perfect speech—proem, _diegesis_, _agon_, and epilogue, a\r\nthird notes _eight_ parts of rhetorical speech—conception, style,\r\nfigure, method, clause, composition, punctuation, and rhythm.\r\n\r\nFor, arbitrary and “cross,” in the technical sense, as these divisions\r\nare (and as, it may be noted in passing, are all subsequent attempts to\r\nproduce things of the same kind), they testify to a salutary sense of\r\ndissatisfaction. They make tacit or more than tacit acknowledgment that\r\nsomething must be put in the place of the old, defunct, purely\r\noratorical Rhetoric—nay, that that Rhetoric itself was incomplete, and\r\nwould have needed extension even if it had not been defunct of its old\r\noffice. Of still further Anonyms one (only partly given in Walz) is\r\ninteresting because it attempts a kind of historical introduction;\r\nanother is couched in “political” (accent-scanned) verses, with curious\r\nrefrains in the different sections, and with odd prose insertions, as\r\nare the acknowledged epitomes of Tzetzes and Psellus. The remainder of\r\nthe volume consists of a brief dictionary of figures, a treatise of some\r\ninterest on “Rhetorical Metres” by a certain Castor, and a brief\r\n_ecthesis_ or exposition of rhetoric generally.\r\n\r\nThe enormous collection of the scholia on Hermogenes fortunately\r\nrequires no detailed notice.[142] At most could we pick out a few\r\nisolated passages bearing more or less directly on our subject, and even\r\nthese would be of scarcely any value, seeing that the authorship and\r\ndate of most of them are quite unknown, and that hardly any can be said\r\nto possess that intrinsic literary interest which might make questions\r\nof date and authorship unimportant.\r\n\r\nFootnote 142:\r\n\r\n  An exception, for reasons to be given later, will be made in favour of\r\n  the work of John the Siceliote (see chap. vi. of this book, p. 187\r\n  _sq._)\r\n\r\nThe eighth and ninth volumes (really the ninth and tenth) present matter\r\nof more individual interest—the eighth because of the principal subject,\r\nwhich with comparatively little alteration is treated by a great number\r\nof authors, the ninth for other reasons. This subject—a subject which\r\nwas to exercise a disastrous attraction on the Rhetoric of the\r\nRenaissance and even of later times—consists of the famous, or infamous,\r\nFigures.[143]\r\n\r\nFootnote 143:\r\n\r\n  About half of the eighth volume, however, is occupied by a long\r\n  distribution of “questions” (ζητήματα) into heads, by one Sopater, who\r\n  gives many specimen declarations. And it is followed by a short\r\n  treatise, assigned to a certain Cyrus, on difference of _stasis_, and\r\n  by a collection of problems for declamatory use.\r\n\r\nWe know from a contemptuous phrase of Quintilian (see _post_) that long\r\nbefore his time the facility of compounds in [Sidenote: _Treatises on\r\nFigures._] Greek had induced the Greeks to multiply Figures beyond all\r\nsense and endurance. Yet as we have partly seen, in the so numerously\r\nattended school of Hermogenes, these famous playthings, though not\r\nexactly neglected, did not receive the first attention. Others, however,\r\nmade up for any apparent neglect of them. We have, specially devoted to\r\nthe subject, under the head of σχήματα or of τρόποι, some fifteen or\r\nsixteen treatises—some by named authors, others anonymous. The first, by\r\na certain Alexander, divides Figures as usual into those of the meaning\r\nand those of the style, and enumerates twenty of the former and\r\ntwenty-seven of the latter; Phœbammon deals more shortly with a somewhat\r\nsmaller number of figures, brought under more general heads; and\r\nTiberius the rhetorician confines himself to the figures in Demosthenes.\r\nHerodian has a very large number of _poetical_ examples—a device which,\r\nas we shall see, served to keep Rhetoric nearer and nearer to literature\r\nas time went on. The little treatise of Polybius of Sardis deals less\r\nwith figures individually than with figurativeness; while an Anonymus,\r\nneglecting to some extent the usual phraseology, but reducing the usual\r\nprocedure unawares to the absurd, manages to give a vast number by\r\ntaking individual expressions from Homer and making a figure out of\r\neach. Zonæus follows more succinctly on the lines of Alexander; another\r\nAnonymus busies himself with Synecdoche only, and yet another adopts the\r\ndictionary arrangement, as do divers others with Tropes. One of the best\r\npieces of the whole is the treatise of Georgius Choeroboscus, a writer\r\nof the fourth or fifth century. It is short, and deals with only a few\r\nfigures; but these are the important ones, the definitions are mostly\r\nclear and sensible, and the examples, though not numerous, are well\r\nchosen.\r\n\r\nThe ninth volume opens with the not unimportant work to which reference\r\nhas been made above, the _De Interpretatione_ [Sidenote: _The Demetrian_\r\nDe Interpretatione.] of Demetrius the Uncertain. But it also contains\r\nsix other works on various divisions of Rhetoric, one of which is at\r\nleast interesting for the great name of Longinus attached to it (as some\r\nwould have it with greater certainty than in the case of the work that\r\nwe would rather wish his), and others for other matter.\r\n\r\nDemetrius takes a somewhat independent view of his subject, which he\r\nputs on a level with Poetics, but does not call Rhetoric. As Poetry, he\r\nstates, deals with—or at least is distinguished and divided by—metres\r\n(this _netteté_ is refreshing, and we shall go farther to fare very\r\noften worse), so what are called clauses[144] divide and distinguish the\r\ninterpretation of prose speech. Then, directing attention directly to\r\nclauses, he illustrates their kinds from the respective beginnings of\r\nthe histories of Hecatæus and the _Anabasis_ of Xenophon, and prefers\r\n(though not to the exclusion of what he does _not_ prefer) short clauses\r\nto long. From clauses he goes to periods, discussing and analysing their\r\ncomposition rather narrowly, and then returns to parallel clauses,\r\nwhence striking off to _homœoteleuta_ he continues his treatise under\r\na great number of similar heads, betraying the slightly heterogeneous\r\nand higgledy-piggledy arrangement which, as we have said already, is so\r\napt to beset these writers on Rhetoric. But he maintains throughout a\r\ncreditable desire to identify his subject with the Art of Prose\r\nComposition, and not merely with Persuasion, or with the composition of\r\nan extremely artificial kind of prize essay on lines more artificial\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nFootnote 144:\r\n\r\n  τὰ καλούμενα κώλα\r\n\r\nThe rhetor Menander, who has left us a treatise on the third division of\r\nrhetorical speeches, Epideictic (generally subdivided [Sidenote:\r\n_Menander on Epideictic._] into encomia and invectives), is thought to\r\nhave lived at the end of the third century. From the first his treatment\r\nis of considerable literary interest, because he handles the sources of\r\nthe material of these curiously artificial compositions. First, he takes\r\nthe hymns about the gods, and here, according to the way of his class,\r\nhe rushes at once into a classification. There are, it seems, nine kinds\r\nof hymns—Cletic, apopemptic,[145] physic, mythic, genealogical,\r\nartificial, prayerful, deprecating, and mixed—the appearance of which\r\nlast heading, here and elsewhere, always makes one wonder how a person\r\nof any logical gifts could write it down without seeing that he made his\r\nwhole classification ridiculous if not fraudulent thereby. Then he\r\nquotes a great number of authors, ranging them under the heads. A\r\nseparate chapter is next given to each kind, still referring to many\r\nauthors, but unluckily seldom or never citing the actual passages. Next\r\nhe passes to the Praising of Cities, that very important part of the\r\nbread-study of the travelling rhetor, who had to make himself welcome by\r\naccommodating his lectures to local patriotism, as we see, for instance,\r\nin Dion Chrysostom (_v. infra_). Hardly in the whole of this dully\r\nfantastic division of literature shall we find anything quainter than\r\nthe sections devoted to this subject. If the city is a landward one, you\r\nwill point out how safe it is from piratical attacks; if it is on the\r\ncoast, you will dwell on the splendours and advantages of the sea. “How\r\nto praise Harbours,” “How to praise Gulfs,” “What is the best fashion of\r\nencomium for an Acropolis?”—these actual headings meet us. At even\r\nfuller length the orator is told how to praise not merely the site but\r\nthe population and its origin, the neighbours (perhaps dispraising them\r\nmight come in best here), the customs, and so forth. In short, the\r\nlittle treatise reminds one most of those modern cookery-books\r\nwhich—assuming the housewives who will read them to be of Paraguayan\r\nkin, and to continue idiots—give not only prescriptions for dishes but\r\nlists of dinners and rules of etiquette. One hardly wonders that a man\r\nlike Lucian, of mother-wit compact to the finger-tips, should have soon\r\nleft a profession in which the average practitioner seems to have been\r\ntaken for granted as next door to a fool, without either common-sense or\r\nimagination enough to meet the most obvious requirements of his\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nFootnote 145:\r\n\r\n  _I.e._, “invocatory” and “dimissory or exorcising.”\r\n\r\nOne MS. of Menander stops here, but another gives us much more of the\r\nsame kind, dealing with the βασιλικὸς [Sidenote: _Others._]\r\nλόγος—flattery of kings—with epithalamia, with consolations, _et\r\ncetera_. The general scheme is much the same, and at least does not\r\ndisincline us to believe it from the same hand. The short treatise of\r\nAlexander on Rhetorical Starting-points is very technical and not very\r\nprofitable; but it falls in with the Menandrine books in showing how\r\nthis business of flattery—the reducing to system of the “dodges” of the\r\nauctioneer or the advertising agent—was, latterly at least, the mainstay\r\nof the rhetorician. The two books of Aristides' _Art of Rhetoric_, on\r\nthe other hand, busy themselves not with the epideictic but with the\r\npolitical speech, and deal chiefly with its technical qualities, our old\r\nfriends. Apsines deals with the exordium only, and Minucianus with the\r\nepicheireme or imperfect rhetorical argument. Between them comes the\r\ntreatise attributed to Longinus by some, and for that reason, if for no\r\nother, worth a little fuller examination.\r\n\r\n“That[146], so to speak, there is nothing better in man’s possession\r\nthan memory, who in his senses will deny? Some indeed praise Oblivion,\r\nas Euripides—\r\n\r\n                   ‘O blessed forgetfulness of woes,’\r\n\r\nas he calls it. But I should say that Lethe and the outgoing of memory\r\nhelp us little or nothing, hurt the best and greatest things of life,\r\ndefraud and keep us short of happiness. For the most hateful of sins and\r\ncrimes, ingratitude, we find oft occurring when memory’s powers fail;\r\nbut he who remembers benefits is neither ungrateful nor unjust. When men\r\nforget the laws and the doctrines that keep us straight, needs must they\r\nbecome poor creatures, and bad, and shameless. Yea, all folly and all\r\ninculture of soul occur through forgetfulness. But he who remembers best\r\nis chiefly wise.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 146:\r\n\r\n  Walz, ix. 570. Aldine, p. 717, and at p. 100 of Egger’s pocket edition\r\n  of Longinus. Dickens was not much of a lover of the classics, but he\r\n  would hardly have disdained this as a motto for _The Haunted Man_.\r\n\r\nThis may not itself be the very crown of wisdom; it is not Plato; it is\r\nnot even _Ecclesiasticus_. But it is at any rate the work of a man who\r\ncan look a little beyond _stasis_ and _diegema_. As if we were to have\r\nnothing certain from this great critic, the attribution of this treatise\r\nalso to him is only based on a conjecture of Ruhnken’s, itself depending\r\non a citation by the commentator John of Sicily in the thirteenth\r\ncentury. It is devoted to the subject of Εὔρεσις—so badly translated by\r\n“Invention”—and it treats of its subject under the heads of\r\n_prosopopœia_, starting-points, elocutory mimicry, memory, topics\r\n[Sidenote: _The_ Rhetoric _or_ De Inventione _of Longinus_.] drawn from\r\nthings connected with the chief good, and passion. There is a fairly\r\nwide range of literary reference, though few citations are given at\r\nlength. And it is only fair to bear in mind that even in the Περὶ Ὕψους,\r\nshort and broken as it is, there are signs of a certain weakness for\r\nFigures and other technicalities, indications that in his more\r\nprofessional moments, and when inspiration deserted him, even the author\r\nof that wonderful little masterpiece might have approached (though he\r\nnever could long have been satisfied with) the endless, the fruitless,\r\nthe exasperating _distinguo_ which seemed to be art, and wisdom, and\r\ntaste, to Hermogenes and the rest. And though one cannot quite agree\r\nwith Walz that there is in this _De Inventione_ a “doctrine drawn from\r\nHomer and the poets, elegantly and equably disposed,” yet one must admit\r\nthat the handling shows something different from, and above, the\r\nheartbreaking jargon-mongering of the usual rhetorician. What follows is\r\nnot the style of the Longinus that we know; it seems to come short of\r\nhis manly sense almost as much as of his far-reaching flights of\r\npoetical appreciation. But it is a long way from the mere arrangement of\r\ncompartments and ticket-boxes, and the mere indulgence in a kind of game\r\nof rhetorical “egg-hat” in and out of them when they are made.\r\n\r\nEnough, perhaps, has been said of the defects of this great mass of\r\ncomposition, both from the point of view of our special [Sidenote:\r\n_Survey of School Rhetoric._] investigation and from more general ones.\r\nIt remains to say something of its merits from the former. As will have\r\nbeen seen, the relations of the rhetoricians to literary criticism\r\ndiffer at first sight surprisingly—less so, perhaps, when they come to\r\nbe examined. Sometimes the general literary view seems to be almost\r\nentirely lost in a wilderness of details and technicalities. But\r\nsometimes also the merely forensic tendency disappears, the merely\r\ntechnical one in the narrow sense effaces itself, and we have an almost\r\npure treatise on Composition, limited it may be by arbitrary\r\nrestrictions, conditioned by professional needs, but still Composition\r\nin general—that is to say, after a fashion, and in a manner, Literature.\r\nEvery now and then, as we saw above, the writer rises to the conception\r\nof Rhetoric as Prosaics—as the other half of that Art of Literature of\r\nwhich Poetics is the one. And—a less good thing, but also not without\r\nits good side—we even find glimpses and glimmerings of the notion, to be\r\ntaken up and widely developed later, of Rhetoric as _including_ Poetics.\r\n\r\nBut the best and most important part of the matter has yet to be\r\nsummarised. The technical study of Rhetoric, even when pushed to the\r\nextremities of the terminological and classifying mania, encouraged and\r\nalmost necessitated constant overhauling of actual literature for\r\nexamples, and encouraged the characterisation of famous authors from\r\nthis point of view. Even the orators by themselves formed no\r\ninconsiderable or undistinguished _corpus_ of Greek prose literature.\r\nBut, as we have seen, it was customary, even for very strict formalists,\r\nto include the historians whose connection with the orators was so\r\nclose; and it was very difficult to exclude philosophical writers,\r\nespecially Plato. A man must have been of preternatural stolidity if he\r\ncould ransack Demosthenes and Isæus, Herodotus and Thucydides and\r\nXenophon, Plato, and the school philosophers whom we have so freely\r\nlost, and if he did not in the process develop some notion of prose\r\nliterary criticism at large, nay, formulate some rules of it. And, as we\r\nhave also seen from the very first, poetry was by no means barred. The\r\norator might very often quote it; he was constantly to go to it for\r\nsuggestions of subject or treatment, beauties of style, examples of\r\nfigure and form. Therefore, directly if not indirectly, the rhetorical\r\nteacher and the historical student accepted the whole of literature for\r\ntheir province.\r\n\r\nOf the actual _results_ of this enormous period, the best part (even if\r\nwe cut off the Dark Ages) of a thousand years of [Sidenote: _The\r\nPractical Rhetoricians or Masters of Epideictic._] elaborate\r\nconcentration upon an extremely artificial art, our remains are in\r\nproportion much less than we should expect; in fact, it is hardly too\r\nmuch to say that they are less than those of the technical books which\r\ntaught how to produce them. It is scarcely fair to call Dionysius of\r\nHalicarnassus a rhetorician, though he sometimes goes near to being one.\r\nHe is a serious teacher of Rhetoric, not a giver of displays in it, a\r\nreal literary critic, a laborious historian. Plutarch is saved from\r\ninclusion in the class by the very same characteristic which interferes\r\nso sadly with his literary criticism as such. He is too practical, too\r\nkeenly interested in life, too busy about the positive sciences of\r\nethical and physical inquiry, to devote himself to rhetorical exercises\r\nof the pure declamatory kind. That Lucian did so devote himself for no\r\ninconsiderable time, we know from his own description of his breaking\r\naway from the Delilah Rhetoric; and there are scraps of purely or mainly\r\nrhetorical matter in him even as it is. But though it be perfectly\r\npossible to serve two mistresses, no man ever could have, for his Queens\r\nof Brentford, Irony and the falser and more artificial kind of Rhetoric.\r\nThe two are irreconcilable enemies: they would make their lover’s life\r\nan impossible and maddening inconsistency. We must therefore look\r\nelsewhere, and in writers on the whole lesser, for the artificial\r\nRhetorical composition which is of interest to us, not merely inasmuch\r\nas it sometimes deals with or comes near to literary criticism itself,\r\nbut as it is, even on other occasions, a valuable and undeniable\r\nevidence as to the state of universal _crisis_, the condition of\r\nliterary taste, at its time. We shall find such witnesses in Dion\r\nChrysostom for the late first and early second century; in Aristides of\r\nSmyrna and Maximus Tyrius for the second exclusively; in Philostratus\r\nfor the end of the second and the beginning of the third; while to these\r\nwe may perhaps add Libanius and Themistius for the fourth, with the\r\nimperial rhetorician Julian to keep them company.\r\n\r\nOf these, Dion Chrysostom is not merely the earliest in date, but, on\r\nthe whole, the most important to literature. He [Sidenote: _Dion\r\nChrysostom._] appears to have been a distinguished and rather fortunate\r\nexample of a “gentleman of the press” (as we should now say) before the\r\npress existed. He travelled over a great part of the Roman Empire in the\r\npursuit of his profession as Lecturer—that perhaps comes nearest to\r\nit—and would appear to have been well rewarded. The description of his\r\nmorning’s employment, which begins his study of the three Poets' plays\r\non _Philoctetes_,[147] is one of the most interesting passages in the\r\nlater and less-known classics, and so is worth giving here, though it\r\nexists in at least one unlearned language: “I rose about the first hour\r\nof the day, both because I was poorly, and because the air was cooler at\r\ndawn, and more like autumn, though it was midsummer. I made my toilette,\r\nsaid my prayers, and then getting into my curricle, went several times\r\nround the Hippodrome, driving as easily and quietly as possible. Then I\r\ntook a walk, rested shortly, bathed and anointed myself, and after\r\neating a slight breakfast, took up some tragedies.” The careful “study\r\nof the body,” the quiet affluence of a well-to-do professional man, and\r\nthe attention to professional work without any hurry or discomfort, are\r\nall well touched off here; and what follows gives us, as it happens, the\r\nclosest approach to our subject proper to be found in the considerable\r\ncollection of Dion’s Orations, or, as they have been much more properly\r\ncalled, Essays. There are, however, others which are more characteristic\r\nof this division of literature, and we may deal with these first.\r\n\r\nFootnote 147:\r\n\r\n  _Dion Chrys. Op._, ed. Reiske (Leipsic, 1784), ii. 266. M. Egger (p.\r\n  441 _sq._) has translated the whole Oration (p. 11), but by no means\r\n  literally.\r\n\r\nThe whole conception of the kind of piece, of which Dion himself has\r\nleft us some fourscore examples, is a curious, and to merely modern\r\nreaders (nor perhaps to them only) something of a puzzling one. It is\r\ncalled an Oration because it was intended to be delivered by word of\r\nmouth; but it often, if not usually, has no other oratorical\r\ncharacteristic. The terms “lecture” and “essay” have also been applied\r\nto it incidentally above, and both have some, while neither has exact,\r\napplication. Except that its subject is generally (not always) profane,\r\nit has strong points of resemblance to some kinds of Sermon. Classified\r\nby the subject, it presents at first sight features which look distinct\r\nenough, though perhaps the distinctness rather vanishes on examination.\r\nNot a few of the examples (and probably those which were more\r\nimmediately profitable, though they could not be used so often) are what\r\nmay be called local panegyrics, addresses to the citizens of Corinth,\r\nTarsus, Borysthenes, New Ilium, in which their historical and literary\r\nassociations are ingeniously worked in, and the importance of the\r\ncommunity is more or less delicately “cracked up.” Others are moral\r\ndiscourses on Vices and Virtues, others abstract discussions on\r\npolitics, others of yet other sorts. But the point in which they all\r\nagree, the point which is their real characteristic, is that they are\r\nall rather displays of art, rather directly analogous to a musical\r\n“recital” or an entertainment of feats of strength and skill, than\r\ndirected to any definite purpose of persuasion, or to the direct\r\nexposition of any subject. The object is to show how neatly the speaker\r\ncan play the rhetorical game, how well he can do his theme. Each is, in\r\nfact (what Thucydides so detested the idea of his history appearing to\r\nbe), a distinct _agonisma_, a competitive display of cleverness and\r\ntechnical accomplishment.\r\n\r\nNothing perhaps is more tedious than a game that is out of fashion; and\r\nthis game has been out of fashion for a very long time. Moreover, it has\r\nbeen out of fashion so long, and its vogue depended upon conditions now\r\nso entirely changed, that it is for us occasionally difficult, even by\r\nstrong effort of mental projection into the past, to discover where the\r\nattraction can ever have lain. Equally good style (and Dion’s is beyond\r\nquestion good) could surely have been expended on something less utterly\r\narbitrary and unreal. Nor do these reflections present themselves more\r\nstrongly anywhere than in regard to the pieces which touch more directly\r\non our subject. Take, for instance, the Trojan oration, which has for\r\nits second title “That Troy was not captured.” It is supposed to be\r\naddressed to the citizens of the New Ilium, and to clear away the\r\nreproach of the Old. The means taken to do this are mainly two. In the\r\nfirst place, the authority of an entirely unnamed Egyptian priest, the\r\nauthor of a book named unintelligibly, is invoked as giving the lie\r\ndirect to Homer, and supporting himself on the documentary evidence of\r\n_stelæ_, which (unluckily) had perished. The second argument (obviously\r\nthought of most weight) is an elaborate examination of the Homeric\r\nnarrative itself from the point of view of what seems probable, decent,\r\nand so forth to Dion the Golden-mouthed. Some of the objections are new;\r\nmost of them very old. Is it likely that a lady who had the honour of\r\nbeing the bedfellow of Zeus would be doubtful of her beauty if an Idæan\r\nshepherd did not certify to it? Would a goddess have given such improper\r\nrewards to Paris, and put herself in such an ugly relation to Helen,\r\nwho, by one story, was her sister? What a shocking thing that the poet\r\nshould constantly speak well of Ulysses and yet represent him as a liar!\r\nHow could Homer have had any knowledge of the language of the gods, or\r\nhave seen through the cloud on Ida? And so forth, for some sixty mortal\r\npages.\r\n\r\nFrom such a procedure no literary criticism is to be expected; and, as\r\nhas been said, the difficulty is to discern what was its original\r\nattraction. As a serious composition it is clearly nowhere; as a _jeu\r\nd’esprit_, the rules of the game quite puzzle us, and the spirit seems\r\nutterly to have evaporated. The Olympic[148] “On the Idea of God” has\r\nbeen cited by some as a contribution to our subject, and certainly\r\ncontains some remarks about Plato and about Myths—interesting remarks\r\ntoo. In substance it is a supposed discourse of Phidias to the assembled\r\nGreeks on the principles he had in mind in the conception of his statue\r\nof Zeus; but its most interesting passage is a comparison of poetry and\r\nsculpture. The mixture of dialects in Homer is compared to the making up\r\nof the palette and the use of “values” in painting; the selection of\r\narchaic words to the choice of the virtuoso lighting on an antique\r\nmedal. The variety of epithet and synonym for the description of natural\r\nand other objects is contrasted with the restraint and simplicity of the\r\nsculptor’s art. The passage is a really remarkable one, and stands\r\nalmost alone, in elaboration if not in suggestion, as the forerunner of\r\na kind of criticism, fruitful but rather dangerous, which has often been\r\nsupposed to have originated with Winckelmann and Lessing and Diderot in\r\nthe last century. But it stands almost alone.\r\n\r\nFootnote 148:\r\n\r\n  Orat. xii. Reiske, i. 370 _sq._\r\n\r\nThe greater apparent promise of the paper on the synonymous plays is\r\nless well fulfilled. Dion seems to imply that this was the only instance\r\nwhere the Three competed on the very same subject, and he finds in the\r\nthree pieces agreeable instances of the well-known general\r\ncharacteristics of their authors—the grandeur, simplicity, and audacity\r\nof Æschylus; the artifice, variety, rhetorical skill of Euripides; the\r\nmediocrity (in no evil sense) and the charm of Sophocles. He has also\r\nsome interesting remarks on the chorus, together with some others less\r\ninteresting, because more in the common style of ancient criticism, on\r\nimpossibilities, improbabilities, breaches of usage and unity, and the\r\nlike. Dion, in fact, goes so far as to express an indirect wish that the\r\nchorus were cut out of tragedy. He had, no doubt, lost the sense of the\r\nreligious use which certainly existed in Æschylus, and perhaps survived\r\nin Sophocles; he could not but observe the combination of nullity and\r\nsuperfluity (which may too often be detected even in these great poets)\r\nof the chorus, if regarded as anything else than an intercalated lyric\r\nof the most exquisite beauty; and he of course saw that the choruses of\r\nEuripides were often as merely _parabasic_, as entirely separated from\r\nall strict dramatic connection, as any address to the audience in\r\nAristophanes himself.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it may best be said of the Golden-mouthed that, in other\r\ncircumstances, and if he had cared, he might have made a critic perhaps\r\nbetter than Dionysius, and perhaps not so very far below Longinus; but\r\nthat, as a matter of fact, neither time, circumstances, nor personal\r\ndisposition attracted him, save here and there, to the subject.\r\n\r\nThere is another author, not far removed in age from Dion Chrysostom,\r\nwhom I should be sorry to pass without at least [Sidenote: _Aristides of\r\nSmyrna._] as minute an examination. Had we only the notices of him which\r\nexist, with a few fragments, there is perhaps no Greek writer from whom\r\nit would be reasonable to expect an abundance of literary criticism, of\r\na type almost as startlingly modern as that of Longinus himself, with\r\nmore confidence than that with which we might expect it from Aristides\r\nof Smyrna.[149]\r\n\r\nFootnote 149:\r\n\r\n  One would not suppose that the later Greek rhetoricians were so\r\n  fascinating as to be _introuvables_; but this is very nearly the case.\r\n  Aristides himself is very scarce and very dear. Maximus Tyrius and\r\n  Themistius refuse themselves to the seeker, except after long waiting;\r\n  and as for Libanius, Messrs Parker of Oxford inform me that they have\r\n  for years been vainly searching for a complete copy of Reiske’s\r\n  edition, while an incomplete one of which they knew was snapped up\r\n  before I could get it. I can only suppose that the editions which\r\n  Reiske himself and Dindorf edited, at the end of the last century and\r\n  early in this, were printed in small numbers, and have been gradually\r\n  absorbed into public libraries. In these latter I have never myself\r\n  been able to work, except under compulsion, and then with no comfort.\r\n  Why Herr Teubner, the Providence of inopulent or leisureless students,\r\n  has been so slow to come to their help in these cases, I do not know.\r\n\r\nLonginus has been blamed by M. Egger[150] for comparing[151] this\r\nrhetorician with Demosthenes. But the excellent historian of Greek\r\ncriticism must have forgotten the epigram, quoted elsewhere,[152] in\r\nwhich Aristides is frankly ranked, not merely with Demosthenes but with\r\nThucydides, as a writer, as well as the other testimonies, both of\r\nantiquity and of the Renaissance, which are conveniently collected in an\r\narticle of Jebb’s edition, to be found in that of Dindorf.[153] It is\r\ntrue that Dindorf himself speaks contemptuously of his client, but\r\nDindorf was too deeply sworn a servant of strictly classical Greek to\r\ntolerate the pretensions of a _précieux_ of the Antonine age. As a\r\nmatter of fact, not only is Aristides a good, though by no means\r\neasy,[154] writer of Greek, but both the qualities and the defects of\r\nhis writing and the causes of his difficulty are such as ought to have\r\ndisposed him to literary criticism in the best sense. This hardness does\r\nnot arise from irregular syntax, nor from any of the commoner causes of\r\n“obscurity.” What makes it necessary to read him with no common care and\r\nattention is, in the first place, the cobweb-like subtlety, not to say\r\ntenuity and intricacy, of his thought; and, in the second, his use of\r\nnot ostensibly strange or archaic language with the most elusive\r\n_nuances_ of difference from its common employment.\r\n\r\nFootnote 150:\r\n\r\n  P. 481, _op. cit._\r\n\r\nFootnote 151:\r\n\r\n  The reading in Long., Frag. 1, is disputed, some suggesting\r\n  _Hyperides_. But Sopater, in commenting on Aristides, attests the\r\n  admiration of Longinus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 152:\r\n\r\n  _V. supra_, p. 82.\r\n\r\nFootnote 153:\r\n\r\n  3 vols., Leipsic, 1829. The collection is at iii. 772. Although\r\n  Dindorf says scornfully, _neque enim is scriptor est Aristides cui\r\n  diutius quis immoretur_, would that all editors gave editions as well\r\n  furnished!\r\n\r\nFootnote 154:\r\n\r\n  Any one who has experienced a humiliating sense of initial bafflement\r\n  may be encouraged, as the present writer was, by the round declaration\r\n  of such a scholar as Reiske, that of all the Greek he had ever read\r\n  outside of the speeches of Thucydides, Aristides was the most\r\n  difficult. Ed. cit., iii. 788.\r\n\r\nNow these are characteristics which are by no means uncommonly found in\r\npersons and in times friendly to criticism. And the love of Aristides\r\nfor literature (at least for the rhetorical side of it) is not only\r\noutspoken, but to all appearance unfeigned. His devotion is not merely\r\nvaletudinarian, but voluntary. If there is a rhetorical extravagance in\r\nthe phrase, there is a more than rhetorical sincerity in the sentiment\r\nof his declarations that, while others may find love or bathing or\r\ndrinking or hunting sweet, speeches[155] are his sole delight: they\r\nabsorb all his friendship and all his faculties; they are to him as\r\nparents and children, as business and pastime. It is about them that he\r\ninvokes Aphrodite: he plays with them and works with them, rejoices in\r\nthem, embraces them, knocks only at their doors. Elsewhere, “the whole\r\ngain and sum of life to man is oratorical occupation”; and elsewhere\r\nagain, “I would rather have the gift of speech, with a modest and\r\nhonourable life as man best may, than be Darius the son of Hystaspes two\r\nthousand times over: and everything seems to me little in comparison\r\nwith this.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 155:\r\n\r\n  The excellent Canterus, who has strung these passages in his\r\n  Prolegomena (iii. 779), would fain translate οἱ λόγοι “literature”;\r\n  but it is pretty certain from the context that Aristides was thinking\r\n  of rhetorical literature only.\r\n\r\nThis is something like a “declaration.”\r\n\r\nNor, on merely running down the list of the fairly voluminous extant\r\nworks of Aristides (especially when the inner meanings, which do not\r\nalways appear in the titles, are grasped), do matters look\r\nunpromising. The majority of the pieces are indeed pure\r\nepideictic—discourses to or about the gods, a mighty “Panathenaic”\r\n(the _chef d'œuvre_, with only one rival, of the author)—panegyrics\r\nof Smyrna, Rome, and other places, “Leuctrics” (_i.e._,\r\ndebating-society speeches, on the side of the Lacedæmonians, on the\r\nside of the Thebans, and neutral), arguments for and against sending\r\nassistance to the Athenian expedition at Syracuse, all the stock—a\r\nstock surprise to us—of this curious declamation-commonplace. But\r\nthere are four pieces (between them making up the stuff of a\r\ngood-sized volume) in which, from such a man, literary criticism might\r\nseem to be inevitable. They are the περὶ τοῦ μὴ δεῖν κωμῳδεῖν[156] (a\r\ndiscourse whether comedy shall be permitted or not), the long Defence\r\nof Rhetoric (περὶ ῥητορικῆς)[157] against Plato’s attacks, especially\r\nin the _Gorgias_, the very much longer and oddly named ὑπὲρ τῶν\r\nτεττάρων,[158] an apology for Miltiades, Themistocles, Pericles, and\r\nCimon, which completes this, and the still more oddly named περὶ τοῦ\r\nπαραφθέγματος[159] (“Concerning my blunder”), which meets, with not a\r\nlittle tartness and wounded conceit, but with a great deal of\r\ningenuity, the suggestion, through a third person, of some “d——d\r\ngood-natured friend,”[160] that Aristides had committed a fault of\r\ntaste by insinuating praises of himself in an address to the divinity.\r\nWe turn to these, and we find as nearly as possible nothing critical.\r\nGlimmers of interest appear, as in the description of historians (ii.\r\n513), as “those between poetry and rhetoric,” but they are\r\nextinguished almost at once. It would be quite impossible to treat the\r\ncomedy question from a less literary standpoint than that of\r\nAristides; we might have Plutarch speaking, except that the writing is\r\nmore “precious” and _point-de-vice_. The “Apology for my blunder”\r\nconsists mainly in a string, by no means lacking in ingenuity, of\r\ncitations from poets, orators, and others, in which they indulge,\r\neither for themselves or their personages, in strains somewhat\r\nself-laudatory. As for the more than four hundred pages of “On\r\nRhetoric” and “For the Four,” they also avoid the literary handling,\r\nthe strictly critical grip of the subject, with a persistency which,\r\nas has been observed in other cases, is simply a mystery, unless we\r\nsuppose that the writer was either laboriously shunning this, or quite\r\nunconscious of its possibility and promise. Pages after pages on the\r\nold _aporia_ whether Rhetoric is an art or not, sheets after sheets on\r\nthe welldoing of the Four, on Plato’s evil-speaking, we have. But,\r\nunless I have missed it, never a passage on the magnificent literature\r\nwith which Rhetoric has enriched Greece, on the more magnificent\r\nrhetoric which the accuser of the brethren has himself displayed in\r\naccusing her. To a man of the subtlety of Aristides, of his enthusiasm\r\nfor literature, of his _flair_ for a popular and striking paradox, one\r\nwould imagine that this beating up of the enemy’s quarters would be\r\nirresistibly tempting. But it is certainly not in his main attack: and\r\nthough, in the vast stretch of wiredrawn argument and precious\r\nexpression, one may have missed something, I do not think that it is\r\neven in the reserves or the parentheses.\r\n\r\nFootnote 156:\r\n\r\n  Ed. cit., i. 751.\r\n\r\nFootnote 157:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., ii. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 158:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., ii. 156-414.\r\n\r\nFootnote 159:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., ii. 491-542.\r\n\r\nFootnote 160:\r\n\r\n  There is enough of the spirit of Sir Fretful in Aristides here to make\r\n  the quotation irresistible.\r\n\r\nThere are perhaps few, at least among the less read Greek writers, who,\r\nin small compass and at no great expense of trouble, throw more negative\r\nlight on Greek criticism than [Sidenote: _Maximus Tyrius._] Maximus\r\nTyrius.[161] This rhetorician or philosopher (he would probably have\r\ndisclaimed the first epithet and modestly demanded promotion to the\r\nsecond) has left us, in a style as easy as that of Aristides is\r\ndifficult, and showing at least a strong velleity to be Platonic, some\r\nforty essays, or dissertations, or theses. They are on questions or\r\npropositions of the usual kind, as these: “Pleasure may be a good but is\r\nnot a stable thing.” “On Socratic Love” (an amiable but slightly\r\nludicrous example of whitewashing everybody, from Socrates himself to\r\nSappho). “On the God of Socrates and Plato,” &c., &c. Several of them\r\nmight, at any rate from the titles, seem to touch our subject; two at\r\nleast might seem to be obliged to touch it. These are the Tenth (in\r\nReiske’s order), “Whether the poets or the philosophers have given the\r\nsoundest ideas of the gods?” and the Twenty-third, “Whether Plato was\r\nright in banishing Homer from his Republic?” Yet, apt to slip between\r\nour fingers as we have found and shall find apparently critical theses\r\nof this sort, hardly one (at least outside Plutarch) is so utterly\r\neel-like as those of Maximus of Tyre. As to the first,[162] he suggests\r\nthat the very question is a misunderstanding—as no doubt it is, though\r\nnot quite in his sense. Philosophy and poetry are really the same thing.\r\nPoetry is a philosophy, “senior in time, metrical in harmony, based on\r\nfiction as to its arguments.” Philosophy is a poetry “renewed in youth,\r\nmore lightly equipped in harmony, more certain in sense.” They are, in\r\nshort, as like as my fingers to my fingers, “and there are ænigmas in\r\nboth.” If you are wise you will interpret the poets allegorically, but\r\ngo to the philosophers for clear statements. And we must allow, to the\r\ncredit of the former, that there is no poet who talks such mischievous\r\nnonsense as Epicurus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 161:\r\n\r\n  Ed. Reiske (after Davies and Markland), 2 vols. (or at least parts),\r\n  Leipsic, 1774.\r\n\r\nFootnote 162:\r\n\r\n  Ed. cit., Part i. pp. 166-187.\r\n\r\nThis is all that, as a critic, Maximus has to say on this head; and\r\nthough at least equally ingenious in evasion, he gives us nothing more\r\nsolid in the debate on Homer and Plato.[163] He speaks, indeed, words of\r\nsense (by no means always kept in mind by critics) as to the absolute\r\ncompatibility of admiration of Homer with admiration of Plato. But his\r\nargument for this, and at the same time the whole argument of the essay,\r\nis only a kind of “fetch.” Homer was banished from the Platonic Republic\r\nnot because Plato thought him bad _per se_, but because the special\r\nconditions of the Republic itself made Homer an inconvenient inmate. He\r\nwas not qualified for admission to this particular club: that was all.\r\nEqually far from our orbit is a third essay, the Thirty-second,[164] the\r\nsubject of which is, “Is there any definite philosophic opinion[165] in\r\nHomer?” Elsewhere Maximus has refused to include literary criticism\r\nwhere it might justly have been expected: here (with, it must be\r\nadmitted, much countenance from persons in more recent times, and\r\nespecially in the present day) he determines to import into literary\r\ncriticism things which have no business there. He begins, indeed, with a\r\nhearty and not unhappy eulogy of Homer himself for his range of subject\r\nand knowledge: but the rest of the piece is little more than an\r\napplication of the theory laid down earlier, that philosophers and poets\r\nare only the same people in different coats, of antique or modern cut as\r\nthe case may be, dancing to different tunes, and gesticulating in a\r\ndifferent way. It may be so; but whether it is or not, Maximus has\r\nnothing more to tell us in our own division.[166]\r\n\r\nFootnote 163:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., Part i. pp. 437-452.\r\n\r\nFootnote 164:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., Part ii. pp. 115-136.\r\n\r\nFootnote 165:\r\n\r\n  Literally any _heresy_—αἵρεσις.\r\n\r\nFootnote 166:\r\n\r\n  The seeker will be even more disappointed if he follow up the quest to\r\n  Diss. 37 (Part ii. p. 196): “Whether the liberal arts (ἐγκύκλια\r\n  μαθήματα) contribute to virtue?” Only geometry and music, and mainly\r\n  the latter, receive attention, though Rhetoric and Poetics are\r\n  mentioned.\r\n\r\nThere are not many positions in literary history more apparently\r\ncovetable than that of being the first certain authority [Sidenote:\r\n_Philostratus._] for a definition of Imagination which (in a sense\r\ndifferent from Sir Thomas Browne’s) “antiquates antiquity,” which\r\nanticipates Shakespeare, which has been piously but vainly thought to\r\nhave been first reached in criticism by Addison, and which, in its\r\nfulness, and as critically put, waited for the Germans of the late\r\neighteenth century, if not for their greater scholar Coleridge, to\r\ndisplay it in perfection. When it is added that this person was a\r\nprofessional rhetorician, that he had sufficient original, or at least\r\nmimetic, skill to supply the pattern of\r\n\r\n                  “Drink to me only with thine eyes,”\r\n\r\nand of others of the prettiest if not the greatest things in literature,\r\nwith sufficient appreciation of arts other than literature to have left\r\nus a capital collection of descriptions of painting,—it may seem that\r\ngreat, or at least interesting, literary criticism must have proceeded\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nYet whoso shall go to the work of Flavius Philostratus[167] in search of\r\nthis will be wofully disappointed, unless (and perhaps even if) he have\r\nthe wisdom necessary to the acceptance of what the gods provide, and the\r\nmore or less resigned relinquishment of what they do not.\r\n\r\nFootnote 167:\r\n\r\n  Ed. Kayser. 2 vols., Leipsic, 1871.\r\n\r\nPhilostratus is in fact a writer of considerable charm. The _Life of\r\nApollonius_ is readable, not only for its matter and its literary\r\nassociations with Keats through Burton; and the smaller _Lives of the\r\nSophists_ are not unimportant for literary history. The _Eikones_ are\r\nperhaps the best descriptions of pictures before Diderot,[168] and the\r\n_Letters_ are really nectareous. Gifford, when deservedly trouncing\r\nCumberland (_alias_ Sir Fretful Plagiary) for finding fault with Jonson\r\nbecause he made up the exquisite poem above cited from Philostratus,\r\nwould have done better to vindicate the original as well from\r\nCumberland’s bad taste and ignorance. “Despicable sophist,” “obscure\r\ncollection of love-letters,” “parcel of unnatural, far-fetched\r\nconceits,” “calculated to disgust a man of Jonson’s classical taste,”\r\nare expressions which, as Gifford broadly hints, probably express not so\r\nmuch Cumberland’s own taste as that of his grandfather Bentley, who, if\r\none of the greatest of scholars, was sometimes, if not always, one of\r\nthe worst of literary critics. But Gifford, who, with all his acuteness,\r\nwit, and polemic power, represented too much the dregs of the\r\nneo-classic school on points of taste, was probably of no very different\r\nopinion. The fact is that, not merely in the passages which Ben has\r\nadapted, sometimes literally, for this marvellous cento, but in many\r\nothers, the very wine, the very roses, of the luscious and florid school\r\nof poetical sentiment are given by Philostratus himself.\r\n\r\nFootnote 168:\r\n\r\n  Achilles Tatius is later, and very likely imitated Philostratus. The\r\n  two together perhaps give the best examples of _ecphrasis_ (see\r\n  Index).\r\n\r\nBut if they are his own, and not, as seems more likely, prose\r\nparaphrases of lost poems by some other, he was not one of the “poets\r\nwho contain a critic.” Not only does he put the remarkable\r\ndefinition[169] of φαντασία, which it is not clear that even Longinus\r\nfully grasped, in the mouth of Apollonius; but it is very noticeable\r\nthat Apollonius is there speaking _not_ of literary art, but of\r\nsculpture and painting. In the description of paintings themselves there\r\nis no criticism. And perhaps among the numerous examples which we have\r\nof the strange difference of view between the ancients and at least some\r\nof ourselves on the suggestiveness of literature, there is no passage\r\nmore striking than the _Heroic Dialogue_[170] on the subject of Homer\r\nbetween a Phœnician stranger and a vine-dresser at Eleus in the Thracian\r\nChersonese, where Protesilaus was supposed to be buried. The stuff of\r\nthis fantastic piece is the information, about the matters of the Trojan\r\nwar, supposed to be supplied to the vine-dresser by Protesilaus himself.\r\nThere is one passage of literary estimate of the ordinary kind, but the\r\nwhole is one of those curious corrections of Homeric statement which\r\nserved as the ancestors of the new and anti-Homeric “tale of Troy” in\r\nthe Middle Ages, and which are among the numerous puzzles of ancient\r\nliterature to us, until we have mastered the strange antique horror of\r\nfiction as fiction. We cannot conceive any one—after childhood—otherwise\r\nthan humorously attempting to make out that Sir Walter Scott did\r\ninjustice to Waverley, and that in the duel with Balmawhapple the Baron\r\nwas only second, not principal, insinuating that the novelist has\r\nconcealed the real secret of Flora’s indifference to her lover, which\r\nwas that she was determined, like Beatrix Esmond, to be the Chevalier’s\r\nmistress, or declaring that Fergus, instead of being captured and\r\nexecuted, died gloriously in a skirmish omitted by historians, after\r\nputting the English to flight. But this is what the ancients were always\r\ndoing with Homer; and it is scarcely too much to say that until this\r\nattitude of mind is entirely discarded, literary criticism in the proper\r\nsense is impossible.\r\n\r\nFootnote 169:\r\n\r\n  _Vit. Ap._, vi. 19, ed. cit., i. 231: “Imagination, a wiser\r\n  craftsmistress than Imitation, has done this; for Imitation will\r\n  fashion what she sees, but Imagination what she has not seen, for she\r\n  will _suppose_ it according to the analogy of the real. Moreover,\r\n  sudden disturbance (ἔκπληξις) will put Imitation’s hand out\r\n  (ἔκκρούει), but not Imagination’s, for she goes on undisturbed to what\r\n  she herself hypothetically conceived.” This _is_ Shakespeare’s\r\n  Imagination, whereof the lunatic, the lover, and the poet are all\r\n  compact; it is not Addison’s, which deals only with things furnished\r\n  by the sense of sight.\r\n\r\nFootnote 170:\r\n\r\n  Ed. cit., ii. 128-219. The piece is sometimes cited as “Heroic_a_.”\r\n\r\nThe relatively considerable space, some six or seven pages, which is\r\nallotted to Libanius in Egger’s book, may have encouraged [Sidenote:\r\n_Libanius._] readers to expect some considerable contribution to\r\ncritical literature from that sophist and rhetorician. But a careful\r\nreading of the French historian’s text will show that he has really\r\nnothing to produce to justify the space assigned: and an independent\r\nexamination of Libanius himself (which, as hinted already, is not too\r\neasy to make[171]) will more than confirm this uncomfortable suspicion.\r\nLibanius is enormously copious, and he is not exactly contemptible,[172]\r\nseeing that he can apply the sort of “Wardour Street” Attic, in which he\r\nand the better class of his contemporaries wrote, to a large number of\r\nsubjects with a great deal of skill. But the curse of artificiality is\r\nover everything that he writes:[173] and, to do him justice, his\r\nwritings proclaim the fact beforehand with the most praiseworthy\r\nfrankness. They belong almost entirely to those classes of conventional\r\nexercise of which full account has been given, and will be given, in the\r\npresent Book and its successor. They are _Progymnasmata_, _Meletæ_,\r\n“orations,” that is to say, rather more practical compositions of the\r\nsame class, ethical dissertations, letters of the kind in which A writes\r\nthat B is a new Demosthenes, and B replies that A really is a second\r\nPlato. The Progymnasmata include all the kinds mentioned earlier in this\r\nchapter, fables and narrations, uses and sentences, encomia and ethopoiæ\r\nand the rest; the Meletæ range from the complaint of a parasite who has\r\nbeen done out of his dinner, through all manner of historical, mythical,\r\nand fantastic cases, to the question whether Lais (after being exiled)\r\nhad not better be recalled as a useful member of society. But literary\r\ncriticism is _nullibi_. If it were anywhere we should look for it in the\r\ncomparison of Demosthenes and Æschines which figures among the\r\n_Progymnasmata_, in the _Life_[174] of the first-named orator and the\r\narguments to his speeches, and perhaps in the _Apologia Socratis_. In\r\nthe first there is not a _scintilla_ of the kind: the comparison wholly\r\nconcerns the lives, characters, and successes of the two. In the\r\n_Apologia_ there is pretty constant reference to Socrates' conversation,\r\nwith some to that of others, Prodicus, Protagoras, &c. But any literary\r\nconsideration is avoided with that curious superciliousness, or more\r\ncurious subterfuge, which we have noticed often already, and which is so\r\nrigid and so complete that it suggests malice prepense—a deliberate and\r\nperverse abstention. The “editorial” matter (to vary a happy phrase of\r\nM. Egger) on Demosthenes is even more surprisingly barren,—mere\r\nbiography, and mere reference to the stock technicalities and\r\nclassifications of _stasis_ and the like, practically exhaust it. I do\r\nnot know how far the fact that he composed, in answer to Aristides,[175]\r\na defence of stage dancing or pantomime, may by some be reckoned to him\r\nas literary righteousness. In his wordy _Autobiography_[176] I can find\r\nnothing to our purpose: and though, in the difficulties of study of him\r\nreferred to, I daresay I have not thoroughly sifted the huge haystack of\r\nthe _Orations_, I think there is very little more there. The _For\r\nAristophanes_[177] has nothing to do with the Aristophanes we know or\r\nwith literature, except that it seems to have been the speech in which\r\nJulian (_v. infra_, p. 126) discovered such wonderful qualities.\r\n\r\nFootnote 171:\r\n\r\n  Besides the difficulty of obtaining Reiske’s ed., there is the further\r\n  one that it is not complete. The _Letters_ have to be sought in that\r\n  of Wolf (Amsterdam, 1738), which is neither in the Library of the\r\n  University of Edinburgh, nor in that of the Faculty of Advocates, nor\r\n  in that of the Signet, so that it had to be run to earth in the\r\n  British Museum, though I have since found a copy for sale. And even\r\n  this combination is, I think, not exhaustive. The _Progymnasmata_,\r\n  _Meletæ_, _Dissertationes_, &c., were published by Claude Morel,\r\n  Paris, 1606; and there are many other editions of parts, but none of\r\n  the whole.\r\n\r\nFootnote 172:\r\n\r\n  See Photius on him, _infra_, p. 181.\r\n\r\nFootnote 173:\r\n\r\n  De Quincey’s truculent attack on Greek rhetoricians generally (_Essay\r\n  on Rhetoric_: _Works_, x. 31, 32) is less unjust to Libanius than to\r\n  any one.\r\n\r\nFootnote 174:\r\n\r\n  For mere completeness' sake I may refer here to other scholiastic\r\n  _Lives_, of which the best known perhaps is that of Thucydides by\r\n  Marcellinus. I do not think it rash to say that they all more or less\r\n  bear out the contention put above as to the _scholia_ generally.\r\n\r\nFootnote 175:\r\n\r\n  Not to the piece mentioned above (p. 115), but to a lost oration. His\r\n  own is at iii. 334 (Reiske).\r\n\r\nFootnote 176:\r\n\r\n  I. 1, Reiske.\r\n\r\nFootnote 177:\r\n\r\n  I. 442, Reiske.\r\n\r\nThe “Monody” and the “Funeral Oration” on Julian himself may again\r\nexcite expectation, for the dead Emperor was certainly a man of letters;\r\nbut they will equally disappoint it. The quaintly named “To Those Who Do\r\nNot Speak” (pupils of his who on growing up and entering the senate or\r\nother public bodies prove dumb dogs) might help us, but does not.\r\nLibanius merely exhorts these sluggards, in the most general way, to be\r\ngood boys, to pay less attention to chariot-racing and more to books. By\r\nfar the larger number of the “Orations” are on political or legal\r\nsubjects, and it would be unreasonable to expect critical edification\r\nfrom them; but even where it might seem likely to come in, it does not.\r\nThe “Against Lucian” (Reiske, vol. iii.) is in the same case as the “For\r\nAristophanes.” The not uninteresting oration in defence of the system of\r\nhis School (No. LXV., the last of Reiske’s third volume) constantly\r\nrefers to a matter which might be of great concern to us—the difficulty\r\nwhich schoolmasters or professors had at this time in keeping their\r\npupils up to the mark in the _two_ languages and literatures, Greek and\r\nLatin. But the discourse is not turned our way.\r\n\r\nNor do the _Letters_, our last resort, furnish us with much consolation.\r\nTheir enormous number—there are over 1600 in Wolf’s edition of the Greek\r\noriginals, while the _editio princeps_ of Zambicarius, in Latin only,\r\nadds problems of divagation and duplication to the heart’s content of a\r\ncertain order of scholar—is to some extent mitigated by their usual\r\nbrevity. But this very brevity is often an aggravation not a mitigation\r\nof teen. Very many are mere “notes,” as we should say, written, indeed,\r\nwith the pomp and circumstance of the epistoler-rhetorician, but about\r\nnothing or next to nothing. Very often Libanius seems to be\r\nunconsciously anticipating the young person who said that he did not\r\n_read_ books, he wrote them. Sometimes, at least, an apparently\r\npromising reference leads to a bitter disappointment, as in the case of\r\nthat to Longinus. The reader—his appetite only whetted by the exertion\r\nof rectifying a miscitation in Wolf’s _Preface_ (it quotes the Letter as\r\n990, while it is really 998)—at last approaches his quest, and reads as\r\nfollows: _To Eusebius_, “The speech [or book] which I want is\r\n_Odenathus_, and it is by Longinus. You must give it me, and keep your\r\npromise.” This is indeed precious; though a remembrance of the\r\ninformation, epistolary and other, vouchsafed in many modern\r\nbiographies, may moderate sarcastic impulses. No sarcasm, but profound\r\nsympathy, should be excited by the professor’s constant complaints of\r\nheadache; yet again they are unilluminative for our purpose. In fact,\r\nsuch examination as I have been able to give to these Epistles shows\r\nthat it is unreasonable to demand from them what they have no intention\r\nto supply. Very likely there are passages in this mass, as in that other\r\nof the Orations, which might be adduced: but I am pretty sure that they\r\nwould not invalidate the general proposition that, to Libanius also,\r\nthose who want literary criticism proper need not go. Perhaps the\r\nnearest approaches to it are such things as the curious mention to\r\nDemetrius (128, Wolf, p. 67) of parts of an artificial epistolary\r\ndiscourse of his friend’s which he, Libanius, received when he had\r\npupils with him, and, after being much bored by their recitations, read\r\nto them instead of lecturing himself.\r\n\r\nThe titles at least of his correspondent Themistius[178] are sometimes a\r\nlittle more promising, and Themistius, a man of considerable [Sidenote:\r\n_Themistius._] and varied public employment, might seem less likely to\r\nindulge in the excesses of mere scholastic exercise which Libanius\r\npermitted himself. But, on the whole, we shall have to acknowledge that\r\nthis other famous rhetorician also is drawn practically blank for our\r\npurpose. “The Philosopher,” “The Sophist,” “How a man should address the\r\npublic”—these are subjects on which one might surely think that a little\r\ncriticism would break in somehow and somewhere. But it never does. To\r\nThemistius, as to so many others, the great writers of old are persons\r\nworthy of infinite respect, to be quoted freely, but to be quoted as a\r\nlawyer quotes this or that year-book, report, decision, for the\r\nsubstance only. The general banality of his literary references may be\r\ntested by anybody who chooses to refer to his citations and discussions\r\nof various authors in the _Basanistes_ (Orat. xxi., _ed. cit._ in note,\r\np. 296), or more succinctly still, to the reference to “golden Menander,\r\nand Euripides, and Sophocles, and fair Sappho, and noble Pindar” in the\r\npleasant little piece, “To his Father,” which comes before it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 178:\r\n\r\n  _Orationes_, ed. Dindorf (Leipsic, 1832). Reiske, in a passage quoted\r\n  at p. xii. of this, rates Themistius as, among other things, _vanus\r\n  jactator philosophiæ suæ, specie magis quam re cultæ, ineptus et\r\n  ridiculus vexator et applicator Homeri et veteris historiæ, tautologus\r\n  et sophista_, &c. On the other hand, Sigismund Pandolf Malatesta, in\r\n  1464, carried off his bones from Sparta and buried them magnificently\r\n  at Rimini as those _Philosophorum sua tempestate principis_. But it\r\n  was for the Aristotelian _Paraphrases_, apparently, that the lover of\r\n  Isotta revered Themistius. I have not neglected these (ed. Spengel, 2\r\n  vols., Leipsic, 1866), but being exclusively on the logical, physical,\r\n  and metaphysical works, they yield us little that I can discover. I\r\n  think Reiske is harsh, but not absolutely unjust.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt extremely unjust to argue from the performance of the\r\npupil to the quality of the teacher; but we may at least say that, if\r\nthere was any stronger critical tendency [Sidenote: _Julian._] in\r\nLibanius or Themistius than appears in their own works, it is not\r\nreflected in one of their most diligent and distinguished pupils.[179]\r\nThe references to literature in the extant works[180] of Julian the\r\nApostate are, in a certain sense and way, extremely numerous; in fact,\r\nit was almost vital to the odd mixture of dupery and quackery which had\r\nmastered him that he should be constantly quoting classical, if only\r\nbecause they were heathen, authors. His _Orations_[181] are crammed with\r\nsuch quotations. Moreover, we have from him a declaration in form of\r\nlove for books. “Some,” he says, at the beginning of his epistle (the\r\nninth) to Ecdicius,[182] “love horses, some birds, some other beasts; in\r\nme from a child there has raged a dire longing for the possession of\r\nbooks.” But in this, as in other cases, Desire seems rather to have\r\nexcluded Criticism. One is rather annoyed than edified by the banal\r\nreference, at the beginning of the _Misopogon_,[183] to his having seen\r\n“the barbarians beyond the Rhine singing wild songs composed in a speech\r\nresembling the croakings of rough-voiced fowls, and rejoicing in this\r\nmusic.” If only the princely pedant would have copied a few of these\r\ncroaks, and studied them, instead of trying to put back the clock of the\r\nworld! His compliments and thanks to Libanius himself for the\r\nabove-mentioned speech (Ep. 14) are of the most hackneyed character. He\r\nread it, he says, nearly all before breakfast, and finished it between\r\nbreakfast and _siesta_.[184] “Thou art blessed to write thus, and still\r\nmore to be able to think thus! O speech! O brains! O composition! O\r\ndivision! O epicheiremes! O _ordonnance_! O departures of style! O\r\nharmony! O symphony!” To which we may add “O _clichés_! O tickets! O [in\r\nMr Burchell’s rudeness] Fudge!”\r\n\r\nFootnote 179:\r\n\r\n  I do not know that Julian was in strictness a “pupil” of Themistius,\r\n  but the tone of the long epistle to him, ed. cit., _inf._, i. 328, is\r\n  at least half pupillary. Himerius, another contemporary sophist to\r\n  whom Photius (_v. infra_, p. 183) devotes some attention, was\r\n  certainly Julian’s tutor. We have some of his work (ed. Wernsdorf,\r\n  Göttingen, 1790 and later), but I have found little to the present\r\n  point in this, which is mostly pure epideictic or didactic.\r\n\r\nFootnote 180:\r\n\r\n  Ed. Hertlein, 2 vols. or parts (Leipsic, 1875-76).\r\n\r\nFootnote 181:\r\n\r\n  Ed. cit., i. 1-327.\r\n\r\nFootnote 182:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., ii. 487. The numbers of the epistles will sufficiently indicate\r\n  the whereabouts of the remaining citations from them.\r\n\r\nIn Ep. 24 there is a playful and pleasant discourse on the sense of the\r\nepithet γλυκὺς given by the poets and others to figs and honey, but it\r\nis only a trifle; and in 34, to Iamblichus, it is noteworthy how\r\nentirely the philosophic interest of literature overshadows, or rather\r\nhow completely it blocks out, the literary whole. In 42, on education,\r\nand literature as its instrument, the old Plutarchian view[185] is\r\nrefurbished, almost without alteration, and with only a fling or two at\r\nthe Galilæans as an addition; while in 55 Eumenius and Pharianus are\r\nexplicitly adjured “not to despise” logic, rhetoric, poetics, to study\r\nmathematics “more carefully,” but to give their whole mind to the\r\nunderstanding of the dogmas of Aristotle and Plato.

As\r\nDionysius is not even to be mentioned with Longinus for what may be\r\ncalled critical inspiration, so he falls simply out of sight when he is\r\ncompared with Aristotle in point of authority, of method, and, above\r\nall, of that somewhat indirect and illegitimate, but real, importance\r\nwhich is derived from a long tradition. So, too, there is nothing in him\r\nof that “flash,” that illumination, which we still receive from the\r\nturning-on of the lamp of satiric genius to the critical field by\r\nLucian, as long before by Aristophanes. But the treatise _On the\r\nSublime_ is, after all, but an inestimable fragment: the loss to\r\ncriticism, had the _Rhetoric_ and the _Poetics_ shared the fate of some\r\nothers of their author’s works, would consist partly in the loss of what\r\nhas been written about them and in following of them; while Aristophanes\r\nand Lucian are only critics at intervals and by accident. In Dionysius\r\nwe have a critic by profession, and not merely a rhetorician, of whose\r\ncritical work an assortment, varied in matter and considerable in bulk,\r\nsurvives, who had an evident love for his business, and whose talents\r\nfor it were very much greater than some authorities seem willing to\r\nallow.\r\n\r\nIt would be unnecessary to observe (if there were not a sort of persons\r\nwho, in such cases, take the absence of mention for [Sidenote: _His\r\nworks._] the presence of ignorance) that the work attributed to\r\nDionysius, and his identity and unity as an author, have been subjected\r\nto the common processes of attempted disintegration. We are told, as\r\nusual, that the works are to be credited or debited not to one\r\nDionysius, but to two or even three Dionysii or others; and that\r\nindividual pieces must or may be split up into genuine and spurious\r\nparts. But this, besides that it is usual and inevitable, concerns us\r\nhere little or not at all. Hardly anything that is about to be said\r\nwould have to be altered, if it were quite certain that the critical\r\nworks of Dionysius of Halicarnassus were the production of a whole club\r\nof contributors, or had accumulated as the successive productions of a\r\nfamily of rhetoricians, as long-lived and pertinacious in Rhetoric as\r\nthe Monros of Edinburgh in another art or science. They consist, taking\r\nthe order of the edition of Reiske,[186] of a treatise of some length on\r\nComposition in the literal sense of the putting together of words; of a\r\nset treatise on Rhetoric; of a collection of brief judgments on the\r\nprincipal authors in Greek, and another of much longer ones, which is\r\nunfortunately not complete, but which contains elaborate handlings of\r\nLysias, Isocrates, Isæus, and Deinarchus; of a letter to a certain\r\nAmmæus, arguing that Demosthenes was not indebted to the rhetorical\r\nprecepts of Aristotle; of another to Cnæus Pompey on Plato and the\r\nHistorians; of a second to Ammæus on the idioms of Thucydides; of a\r\ncelebrated and interesting examination, at great length, of the chief\r\nhistorians of Greece; and of another, also well known, which is usually\r\nquoted by its Latin title, _De Admiranda Vi dicendi Demosthenis_, where\r\nδεινότης, perhaps, might be more properly translated “Of Demosthenes'\r\noratorical resourcefulness.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 186:\r\n\r\n  6 vols., Leipsic, 1775-77. The first four contain the historical, the\r\n  two last the rhetorical work. A pamphlet edition of rhetorical\r\n  fragments, by C. T. Rössler (Leipsic, 1873), may be usefully bound in\r\n  with this. But Usener’s still more recent edition of the so-called\r\n  περὶ μιμήσεως and the Epistles of Ammæus and Pompey (Bonn, 1889) is of\r\n  great importance for its remarks on Dionysius and Quintilian, and for\r\n  other animadversions.\r\n\r\nOf these the least interesting by far is the professed _Rhetoric_: and\r\nit is with the less reluctance that we may resign it to those [Sidenote:\r\n_The_ Rhetoric.] who pronounce it, in whole or in part, spurious. It\r\nopens, in the very worst and most sterile form of the ancient Rhetoric,\r\nby a series of chapters on the different commonplaces available for\r\norations on different stock subjects and occasions,—a panegyric, a\r\nmarriage, a birthday, a funeral, an exhortation to athletes—things trite\r\nand obvious to desperation, the very cabbage of the schools, the\r\nopprobrium of all ancient literature, though perhaps not worse than our\r\nown frantic efforts to avoid the obvious. It passes to the favourite\r\nsub-subject of the Figures, but does not treat these in the worst way,\r\ngives the usual, chiefly poetical, illustrations, and concludes with\r\nobservations on the (again usual) subdivisions of the matter. There is\r\nnothing in it that is original and nothing that is characteristic, and\r\nthe most Dionysian traits, such as the curious stress laid upon the\r\nHerodotean episode of Gyges, might as well have been copied by an\r\nimitator as duplicated by the author himself.\r\n\r\nThe remaining works are much better and much more important. It is true\r\nthat the _De Compositione_ (as its title [Sidenote: _The_ Composition.]\r\nhonestly holds forth) belongs to the lower, not the higher, division of\r\nthe school-grouping of the subject—to Composition, not to Rhetoric. But\r\nproper Composition, even in the school sense, is the necessary vestibule\r\nof style; and, until attention has been paid to it, there is no hope of\r\nanything further that shall be of real use in literary criticism. And it\r\nis also not only something, but a great thing, to make an advance upon\r\nthat (one had but for a sacred shame, almost said) ignorant and\r\nunintelligent contempt of words as words which we find in Aristotle\r\nhimself. Dionysius indeed, as in duty bound, glances at the contempt of\r\n_lexis_ which the great Master of the Walk had made fashionable. It is\r\ntrue, he says, that boys are caught by the bloom of style, but it takes\r\nthe experience of years to judge it rightly. And he promises a\r\nsupplementary treatise _On the Choice of Words_, which we should be very\r\nglad to possess. But for the present he is busied, not with their\r\nchoice, but with their arrangement after they are chosen; and he deals\r\nwith this partly by positive precept, but chiefly by the use of\r\nexamples, from Homer in poetry and Herodotus in prose. Dionysius was a\r\nfervent devotee of his admirable countryman, allowing his devotion,\r\nindeed, to carry him to the length of distinct injustice to that\r\ncountryman’s great rival Thucydides; but it has here inspired him well\r\nenough. And Homer could not lead him wrong; though perhaps we may note\r\nhere, as elsewhere with the ancients, a distinctly insufficient\r\nappreciation of the differences between poetry and prose. He begins\r\nquite at the beginning with the letters, touches on onomatopœia—that\r\nprocess which the great poetic languages like Greek and English admit so\r\nreadily, and of which the less poetic like Latin and French are so\r\nafraid—and on the practice (of which, like a true critic, he has no\r\nfear) of reviving archaisms when desirable. Then he attacks the question\r\nhow beautiful diction and composition are to be attained. Here again,\r\nand necessarily, he proceeds more by example than by precept, for indeed\r\nprecept, of the _a priori_ kind, is in these matters mostly valueless.\r\nBut one sentence (p. 96, Reiske) is worth quoting at length, because it\r\nputs boldly the truth which Aristotle had evaded or pooh-poohed in his\r\nexcessive devotion to the philosophy of literature rather than to\r\nliterature itself: “So that it is necessary that that diction should be\r\nbeautiful in which there are beautiful words, and that of beautiful\r\nwords beautiful syllables and letters are the cause.” Dionysius knew\r\nthis, as Longinus knew it three hundred, as Dante knew it thirteen\r\nhundred, years after him: but, six hundred years after Dante, there are\r\nstill persons who seem to regard the fact as somehow or other degrading.\r\n\r\nThen he goes to what even Aristotle had not disdained,—though, in common\r\nwith Dionysius himself, Quintilian, and others, he speaks on the subject\r\nin terms not easy for modern comprehension,—the rhythmical adjustment of\r\nprose as well as of verse, admitting even in Thucydides, to whom he is\r\nas a rule not too just, an abundant possession of this gift of rhythm.\r\n\r\nA very striking passage, and the oldest of its kind, occurs at p. 133,\r\nR, in which Dionysius declares his own conviction that the style is\r\nnoblest of all which has greatest variety, most frequent changes of\r\nharmony, most transitions from periodic to extra-periodic arrangement,\r\nmost alternations of short and long clauses, rapid and slow movements,\r\nand greatest shift of rhythmical valuation. For we must remember that,\r\neven after the advances which the study of seventeenth- and the practice\r\nof nineteenth-century writers have made in English prose rhythm, it can\r\nprobably never attain to the formal particularity—I do not say\r\nperfection—of Greek. We cannot—at least the present writer, who has been\r\ntold that he has no ill ear, cannot—appreciate the effect of a dochmiac\r\nas a single foot; it is hard to do more than guess at the effect on a\r\nGreek of the use of the different pæons; and in at least one famous\r\npassage of Quintilian all candid moderns have confessed themselves\r\nbaffled.[187]\r\n\r\nFootnote 187:\r\n\r\n  See _infra_, bk. ii. p. 304 _sq._\r\n\r\nHis Pindaric example is interesting because it is about the only\r\nconsiderable fragment which we have of the master’s Dithyrambic\r\nwriting.[188] His Thucydidean specimen is the well-known proem to the\r\nHistory. The criticism of the Pindaric extract may seem to modern\r\nreaders a rather odd _pot-pourri_ of merely grammatical or linguistic,\r\nand of strictly critical, observations. Thus Dionysius observes that the\r\nfirst member[189] consists of four parts of speech: a verb, two nouns,\r\nand a “conjunction” (he expressly, in another passage, intimates doubts\r\nwhether this or “preposition” is the proper word to use), and then,\r\nafter this mere “parsing,” handles the construction of the phrase and\r\nthe juxtaposition of it, attributing a certain designed discord or clash\r\nas the general motive of the piece. And he recognises the same clash in\r\nthe Thucydidean passage, in which, while (like a rhetorician as he is)\r\nhalf regretting the absence of panegyric and theatrical grace, he admits\r\n“an archaic and headstrong beauty,”[190] supporting this general verdict\r\nwith the same minute examination as before. Next he quotes Sappho’s\r\ngreat hymn to Aphrodite, as Longinus was afterwards to quote its greater\r\ncompanion, allowing (and no wonder!) felicity of diction and grace to\r\nthis in the fullest degree. And later he occupies a good deal of space\r\nwith those approximations between oratory and poetry, which may seem to\r\nus otiose, but which have more than one good side, the best of all\r\nperhaps being the fact that they induced critics, as in the instances\r\nreferred to, to quote, and so preserve, precious fragments which we\r\nshould otherwise have lost.\r\n\r\nFootnote 188:\r\n\r\n  See also the amended text in Bergk’s _Lyrici Græci_, i. 392-395.\r\n\r\nFootnote 189:\r\n\r\n  ἴδετ’ ἐν χορὸν Ὀλύμπιοι. Some MSS. read δεῦτ’, which appears in\r\n  Reiske. The comment requires a _verb_: but perhaps Dionysius might\r\n  have regarded δεῦτε as such.\r\n\r\nFootnote 190:\r\n\r\n  ἀρχαικὸν δέ τι καὶ αὔθαδες κάλλος.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, this treatise, if studied carefully, must raise some\r\nastonishment that Dionysius should have been spoken of disrespectfully\r\nby any one who himself possesses competence in criticism. A good deal of\r\nthe work is, no doubt, for us, a little out of fashion; the traditional\r\ntechnicalities seem jejune; the processes are out of date. Yet, from\r\nmore points of view than one, the piece gives Dionysius no mean rank as\r\na critic. To those who want characteristic aspects, aspects put in\r\nstriking phrase, that attribution of “headstrong beauty” to Thucydides\r\nshould excuse a good deal: that is no mere dead ticket of the schools.\r\nTo the more methodical critic of criticism the minute processes of\r\ninvestigation, the careful estimate of the incidence of such a sound in\r\nsuch and such a position, even the mere parsing view of clauses and\r\nsentences, are things themselves worthy of minute study. And it is not\r\nonly fair, but no more than necessary, to remember that this, after all,\r\nis only a treatise on a certain aspect or department of criticism, and\r\nthat we have no right to demand from it more than satisfactory treatment\r\nof its special subject—the “composition,” the symphonic arrangement of\r\nwords and the elements of words. To some moderns Dionysius may seem too\r\nattentive to mint and anise and cumin; but he would have no great\r\ndifficulty in retorting equally contemptuous comparisons for the windy\r\ngeneralisations on one hand, and the sheer neglect of all minutiæ of\r\nform on the other, which characterise too much modern critical work.\r\n\r\nThe short “censures” of ancient writers have, perhaps, an interest of\r\ncuriosity greater than their interest of value. It is [Sidenote:\r\n_Censures and Commentaries on Orators, &c._] not improbable that they\r\nserved as a pattern to Quintilian, who often suggests a knowledge of\r\nDionysius.[191] But though they are ushered in with some quite\r\nirreproachable commonplaces as to the excellence of contemplating\r\nexcellent models, they are themselves, at least sometimes, too brief,\r\nand too specifically sententious, to have much intrinsic interest or\r\nmuch teaching power. We are not greatly advanced in the understanding of\r\nHesiod, whether we have read him or not, by being told that he paid\r\nattention to pleasure, and the smoothness of words, and harmonious\r\ncomposition. Nor can any of the poetical labels of our Halicarnassian be\r\nsaid to be very much more informing, while in dramatic writers he does\r\nnot go beyond “The Three,” and has little to tell us that is newer than\r\nthe tolerably obvious things that Æschylus is magnificent in his\r\nlanguage, Sophocles noble in his characterisation, Euripides\r\nquestionable in both. The historians he treats at first in contrasted\r\npairs—Herodotus and Thucydides, of course, Philistus and Xenophon,—then\r\nTheopompus alone. The philosophers he polishes off in a combined\r\nparagraph of a dozen lines, which hardly attempts to be characteristic\r\nsave in the case of Aristotle. And then, with a half apology for so\r\nsummarily despatching these, he turns, as to his proper business, to the\r\norators. But even here we have mere summary, and must turn to the far\r\nfuller, but, unluckily, not quite complete, _Commentaries_ on the same\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nFootnote 191:\r\n\r\n  See on this point Usener (_op. cit._), who would rather suppose a\r\n  common indebtedness. The “censures” form the bulk of the fragments\r\n  which he has published as περὶ μιμήσεως. Perhaps the best examples of\r\n  really illuminative critical phrase in them are the “pugnacious\r\n  roughness,” ἀγωνιστικὴ τραχύτης, ascribed to Antimachus, and the\r\n  “combination of magnificence and terseness,” μεγαλοφυὲς καὶ βραχύ, to\r\n  Alcæus. Of the shorter fragments the summary of the requirements of\r\n  art as “a happy nature, exact study, and laborious practice” is good\r\n  if not astonishing.\r\n\r\nThese, addressed to his favourite correspondent Ammæus, begin with the\r\nfamiliar complaint (which no critical experience of the past ever drives\r\nfrom a critic’s mouth) about the badness of the literary times. The good\r\nold Attic Muse herself, like a neglected wife, is insulted, deprived of\r\nher rights, and even menaced in her existence, by impudent foreign\r\nbaggages, Phrygian, or Carian, or Barbarian out and out. But we are\r\nrather surprised (till we remember that Dionysius was a settler at Rome,\r\nand that it was his interest, if not to do as the Romans did, at any\r\nrate to please them) to hear that things are improving, owing to the\r\ngood sense of the governors of the Roman state, itself the governess of\r\nthe world. There is some hope that this “senseless eloquence will not\r\nlast for another generation.”[192] And Dionysius will do what he can to\r\nhelp the good work by a study of the six greatest of the old Attic\r\norators, Lysias, Isocrates, Isæus, Demosthenes, Hyperides, Æschines.\r\nUnluckily we only have the first three of these, though a judgment of\r\nDeinarchus, not promised, exists, and the _De Admiranda Vi_ supplies the\r\ngap, as far as Demosthenes goes, in even fuller measure than in\r\nproportion to the others. We may as well take these and other things\r\ntogether, in order to have something like a conspectus of the case\r\nbefore summing up the critical characteristics of this most interesting\r\ncritic.\r\n\r\nFootnote 192:\r\n\r\n  Petronius found that it did!\r\n\r\nIf they are somewhat disappointing, this (to borrow the convenient bull)\r\nis not much more than we might have expected. [Sidenote: _The minor\r\nworks._] The _De Admiranda Vi_ is by far the best of them, and contains\r\na great deal of excellent criticism, both particular and general. But\r\nthe orators had already for centuries been the very parade-ground of\r\nRhetoric; and as paradoxical excursions from orthodox limits were,\r\nthough by no means unknown to the ancients, not in great favour with\r\nthem, everything that was likely to be said of the Ten was trite and\r\nhackneyed. The smaller epistles and the judgment of Thucydides (perverse\r\nas this last exploit is) are, on the whole, more interesting. The little\r\npaper on the _Rhetoric_ of Aristotle and the Speeches of Demosthenes,\r\narguing that the latter are anterior to the former, is of a kind with\r\nwhich modern times are only too familiar, but displays none of the\r\npuerility and false logic which, in our modern instances, that\r\nfamiliarity has taught us to associate with the kind. The contention is\r\nundoubtedly sound: the handling is reasonable, and the whole makes us\r\ndistinctly sorry that Dionysius, who had access to so much that we have\r\nlost, did not write a complete _History of Greek Literature_, which\r\nwould have been invaluable, instead of his _History of Rome_, which we\r\ncould have done without, though it is far from valueless. As it is, this\r\nis one of the few important contributions to such a history that we\r\npossess, of really ancient date. If he is less happy in the judgment of\r\nPlato, inserted (with some on the historians) in the letter to Cnæus\r\nPompey, this is principally due to that horror of poetic prose, of\r\ndithyrambic expression, which (perhaps for better reasons than we know)\r\nwas then creeping over criticism, and which we shall find dominant in\r\ncritical, though not in popular, estimate during the earlier centuries\r\nof the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nThe second epistle to Ammæus seems to be one of the latest of the\r\nnumerous utterances of Dionysius on the great Athenian historian. It is\r\nsomewhat meticulous and verbal; but it is curious that the\r\njust-mentioned horror of gorgeousness reappears in it.\r\n\r\nAnd so we come to the famous onslaught in form against the son of\r\nOlorus. It is introduced by a somewhat elaborate [Sidenote: _The\r\njudgment of Thucydides._] apology—the critic going so far as to shelter\r\nhimself under the leading case of Aristotle _v._ Plato. Thence he passes\r\nto a short sketch of the predecessors of Thucydides in history, commends\r\nhim for dropping their fables, &c., but soon settles down to a regular\r\n_éreintement_—a “slating” criticism of the familiar type, wherein the\r\ndesire to “dust the varlet’s jacket” is evidently not merely superior\r\nbut anterior to any desire whatsoever to criticise varlet or jacket on\r\nthe merits of either. The division into winters and summers, the setting\r\nforth of the causes of the war, the conduct and details of the story,\r\nthe speeches—all come in for reprehension. But Dionysius is, as we\r\nshould expect from his other handlings, much kinder to the style, though\r\nhe objects to its occasional obscurity, urges difficulties on the score\r\nof the Figures, criticises some passages at great length, and ends by\r\nnoticing the chief of the historian’s imitators, among whom he includes\r\nDemosthenes. On the whole, the article (as we may call it), though\r\none-sided, is less so than some current descriptions of it may have\r\nconveyed to those who have not read it. But still it belongs to the\r\nclass of critiques indicated above, a class in which few of the best\r\nexamples of criticism are to be found, except from the point of view of\r\nthose who hold the true business of that art to be, like the “backward\r\nvoice” of Trinculo-Caliban, “to utter foul speeches and to detract.”\r\n\r\nYet, on the whole, it need not interfere with the emphatic repetition of\r\nthe opinion, with the expression of which this [Sidenote: _General\r\ncritical value._] notice of the Halicarnassian began, that he is a very\r\nconsiderable critic, and one to whom justice has not usually, if at all,\r\nyet been done. Great as is the place which he gives to oratory, there is\r\nno ancient writer (except Longinus) who seems so free from the intention\r\nto allow it any really mischievous primacy. If he is, as might be\r\nexpected from a teacher, sometimes a little meticulous in his philology\r\nand lower Rhetoric, yet this very attention to detail saves him from the\r\ndistinctly unfortunate and rather unphilosophical superciliousness of\r\nAristotle towards style, and from the equally unfortunate divagation,\r\nboth of that great man and of all his followers, into questions vaguely\r\næsthetic instead of questions definitely literary. The error which, at\r\nthe new birth of criticism in Europe, was so lucklessly reintroduced and\r\nexaggerated by the Italian critics of the sixteenth century—the error of\r\nwool-gathering after abstract questions of the nature and justification\r\nof poetry, of the _a priori_ rules suitable for poetic forms, of\r\nUnities, and so forth—meets very little encouragement from Dionysius,\r\nand it is perhaps for this very reason that he has been slighted by\r\nhigh-flying æstheticians. Not thus will the wiser mind judge him, but as\r\na critic who saw far, and for the most part truly, into the proper\r\nprovince of literary criticism—that is to say, the reasonable enjoyment\r\nof literary work and the reasonable distribution of that work into good,\r\nnot so good, and bad. Here, and not in the Laputan _meteorosophia_ of\r\ntheories of poetry, is criticism’s main work; not that she may not\r\njustly imp her wings for a higher flight now and then, but that she must\r\nbeware of flapping them in the inane.\r\n\r\nIf the opinions of the criticism of the critical power and position of\r\nDionysius of Halicarnassus have varied rather [Sidenote: _Plutarch._]\r\nstrangely, those uttered concerning Plutarch as a critic are still more\r\nirreconcilable. For he has not only been casually suggested but\r\nelaborately championed[193] as a candidate for the signal honour of the\r\nauthorship of the Περὶ Ὕψους—that is to say, as one capable of producing\r\nwhat is perhaps the critical masterpiece of antiquity, and certainly one\r\nof the few critical masterpieces of the world. From this one would be\r\nprepared to expect at least very strong evidences of critical faculty,\r\nand some noteworthy pieces of critical accomplishment, in his extant\r\nworks, which, it must be remembered, are extremely voluminous, and of a\r\ncharacter remarkably well suited for the exercise of literary criticism.\r\nThe _Vitæ Parallelæ_ at least _might_ have been frequently directed in\r\nthis way; while the enormous miscellany of the _Moralia_ corresponds\r\nmore closely to the “Essays” of modern writers than any collection of\r\nthe kind that we have from ancient times. Now, it is hardly necessary to\r\nsay that the modern Essay has from the very first set strongly in the\r\nliterary direction, and that up to the present time the amount of\r\nliterary criticism, in essay form, is probably not less, while the value\r\nof it is infinitely greater, than that of all the formal treatises and\r\nnon-essay-fashioned handlings of the subject.\r\n\r\nFootnote 193:\r\n\r\n  By Vaucher and some others.\r\n\r\nOn turning to the _Lives_ we meet with an almost complete\r\ndisappointment. If it be said that Plutarch’s object was to give us\r\ncontrasts of practical men—soldiers and statesmen, not philosophers or\r\nmen of letters—that is, no doubt, a valid answer as far as it goes,\r\nthough it would scarcely be unfair to argue from the fact that, at any\r\nrate, matters literary were not of the first importance to him. But in\r\none famous instance, the parallel of Demosthenes and Cicero, he not only\r\nhad a most proper opportunity for dealing with the subject, but was\r\nalmost obliged to deal with it. It must therefore be worth while to look\r\nat his dealing.\r\n\r\nHe begins the “Demosthenes” with an excuse for his small knowledge of\r\nLatin, and makes this a pretext for deliberately excluding all literary\r\nand even all oratorical comparison [Sidenote: _The_ Lives _quite barren\r\nfor us_.] of the two. Nay, he goes further, and actually upbraids\r\nCæcilius (apparently the same person whose treatment of the Sublime\r\nLonginus did not like) with having made this. After such a refusal it is\r\nsurely idle to contend for any real or strong literary and critical\r\n_nisus_ in the agreeable moralist and biographer of Chæronea. Had there\r\nbeen any such tendency in him, he simply could not have avoided such a\r\npalmary occasion of giving it course. Even if he really considered\r\nhimself incompetent to deliver an opinion of Cicero, he would have had\r\nsomething to say about Demosthenes even if this declared incompetence\r\nwas only a disguise for the reluctance to treat Latin literature\r\nseriously, which is so noticeable in Greeks, this would not invalidate\r\nthe reasoning.\r\n\r\nLet us, however, for the sake of the argument, and out of pure\r\ngenerosity, accept his excuse, put the _Lives_ out of the question, and\r\nturn to the _Moralia_.[194] As has been [Sidenote: _The_ Moralia _at\r\nfirst sight promising_.] said above, if we do not find literary\r\ncriticism, and good literary criticism, in such a collection of a man’s\r\nwork, it must be either because he has no taste for it, or because he\r\nhas the taste without the faculty. For the collection is very large, and\r\nit is almost absolutely miscellaneous: the mere title _Moralia_ is\r\nnothing more than an unauthorised ticket, and has really nothing to do\r\nwith the contents. Neither Montaigne nor De Quincey takes a more\r\nabsolute liberty of speaking on any subject that happens to strike his\r\nfancy than Plutarch. And it cannot be said that at least some of his\r\nsubjects are without direct connection with criticism. The two opening\r\npapers, “On the Education of Children” and \"How a young man should read\r\n[“listen to,” literally, but this means what we mean by \"read\"] the\r\nPoets,\" would seem, the one almost necessarily (considering the humanism\r\nof ancient education), and the other inevitably, to lead to the subject.\r\nThe next on “Hearing” (_i.e._, “Reading”) generally, might even seem to\r\nstrengthen the necessity. Many of the [Sidenote: _Examination of this\r\npromise._] other titles are promising, and, both in the nature of the\r\ncase and from what we know of the general course of ancient table-talk,\r\nthe bulky volume of _Symposiac Questions_ might seem likely to be most\r\nprolific, while it is actually not infertile in matter of our kind. Let\r\nus examine what is the performance of these promises.\r\n\r\nFootnote 194:\r\n\r\n  I use the Teubner edition by Hercher and Bernardakis, 5 vols., Leipsic\r\n  (1872-1893).\r\n\r\nEnglishmen, and especially students of English literature, ought to take\r\nno mean interest in the tractate on Education, [Sidenote: _The\r\n“Education.”_] if only for the reason that it had a most powerful\r\ninfluence on the great Elizabethan age, both directly and through the\r\nmedium of Lyly’s _Euphues_, which is in part[195] almost a translation\r\nof it. But though, not merely for this but other more intrinsic reasons,\r\nthe treatise _is_ interesting, it is not of much good to us. In fact, it\r\nis scarcely a paradox to say that it is one of its merits not to be of\r\nmuch good to us. It is a truism that the very noblest characteristic of\r\nGreek education, a characteristic never fully recovered since, was its\r\ncombination of high literary ideas with the most perfect and practical\r\nrecognition of the fact that book-education by itself is education of\r\nthe most wretchedly inadequate character. Plutarch (and again it is much\r\nto his credit) thoroughly shared this view—so thoroughly that he begins\r\nhis treatise a little before the birth of the children to be educated,\r\nand continues it (quite in the Rousseau style) by insisting that mothers\r\nshall suckle their own offspring. From the first the importance of\r\ninculcating good habits, of not telling children immoral or silly\r\nstories, of being careful in the selection of nurses and tutors,—this is\r\nthe thing that Plutarch busies himself about. He will have them learn\r\nall the usual arts and sciences, but he dwells on these very little. How\r\nto give them good morals and healthy bodies; how to keep them or wean\r\nthem from bad company and foul language; how to practise them in manly\r\nsports and exercises—these are Plutarch’s cares. Excellent, nay! thrice\r\nexcellent preoccupation! but it necessarily makes the treatise of no use\r\nto _us_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 195:\r\n\r\n  The section “Euphues and his Ephœbus.” The three tractates\r\n  commented on in this and the next paragraph will be found in vol. i.\r\n  pp. 1-111 of the edition cited.\r\n\r\nNo one can reasonably blame its author for this, especially as he seems\r\nlikely to fill up the gap in the two following Essays. [Sidenote: _The\r\nPapers on “Reading.”_] “How a young man should read Poetry” is a title\r\nwhich would serve well for the very best and most stimulating critical\r\nobservations of a Coleridge or an Arnold; or to go nearer to its own\r\ntimes, it might really do for an alternative heading to the Περὶ Ὕψους\r\nitself. Yet we very soon see—and we must know our Plutarch very little\r\nif we do not _fore_see it—that the ethical preoccupation is just as\r\nsupreme and exclusive here. The piece is in itself an interesting one,\r\nand preserves for us a large number of quotations, some of which are\r\nunique. But Plutarch’s handling of them is as little literary as he can\r\nmake it. You cannot (he tells his friend Marcus Sedatus with a kind of\r\ngloomy resignation) prevent clever boys from reading poetry, so you must\r\nmake the best of it. It is like the head of an octopus, very nice to\r\neat, nourishing enough, but apt to give restless and fantastic dreams.\r\nSo you must be careful to administer pædagogic correctives, and to put\r\nthe right meaning on dangerous things, like the account of Helen’s\r\ncomplaisance to Paris after his disgraceful flight from battle, and of\r\nHera’s bewitching Zeus with the aid of the Cestus. This kind of thing\r\nruns throughout the piece—the most famous certainly, and perhaps the\r\nmost diverting instance of Plutarch’s mania for moralising, being his\r\ndealing with the delightful passage of the meeting of Nausicaa and\r\nOdysseus. He does not indeed go the entire length of the neo-classical\r\ncritics of the French school as to this gem. He only says that _if_ the\r\nPrincess fell in love with Odysseus at first sight, her boldness and\r\nimpudence are very shocking. But if she perceived what a sensible man he\r\nwas, and preferred him to some rich dandy of her fellow-citizens, it was\r\nmost creditable. It is not of course worth while to waste any good\r\nindignation, or any otherwise utilisable scorn, upon this priggish\r\nsilliness, the dregs of older Platonism-and-water, the caricature and\r\nreduction-to-the-absurd of a confusion only too common among ancient\r\ncritics, and not quite unknown among modern. It is only necessary to\r\npoint out that, from a man capable of it, good literary criticism would\r\nbe surprising, and that as a matter of fact there is here no strictly\r\nliterary criticism at all. The paper ends as it began, with the general\r\ndoctrine that the young must be well steered in their reading, so that\r\nthey may be kindly handed on by Poetry to Philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe more general tract, “How one should [hear or] read,” is shorter, has\r\nfew quotations or none, and is less obtrusively moral in tone. But it\r\nstill regards hearing, or reading, not in any way as the means of\r\nenjoying an artistic pleasure, but as the means of acquiring or failing\r\nto acquire information or edification. You must listen (or read)\r\nattentively: not take unreasonable likes and dislikes, excessive\r\nadmirations and contempts. You must more particularly _not_ take special\r\npleasure in style and phrase. (Here we come not so much to neglect of\r\nliterary criticism as to positive blasphemy against it.) A man who will\r\nnot attend to a useful statement, because its style is not Attic, is\r\nlike a man who refuses a wholesome drug because it is not offered him in\r\nAttic pottery. Later, there are some remarks on actual tricks of style.\r\nBut, on the whole, it would be possible for a man to be educated, to\r\nlive his life, carefully observing the precepts of this little batch of\r\ntracts, and to die a most respectable person, after perhaps having lived\r\na happy and useful life, yet never to know or to care whether or why\r\nPlato was a better prose-writer than any tenth-rate sophist, Tennyson a\r\nbetter poet than Tom Sternhold or Tom Shadwell.\r\n\r\nTurn to the _Lives of the Orators_.[196] There is no question here,\r\nunder the head of Demosthenes, of any inability to understand Latin; and\r\nthe various styles of the famous Ten might have tempted most, and did\r\ntempt many, Greeks to indulge in literary analysis and literary\r\ncomparison. In the tractate [Sidenote: _The_ Lives of the Orators.]\r\nbefore us, be it Plutarch’s or be it somebody else’s, the author avoids\r\ntouching upon even the fringe of the literary part of his subject with\r\nan ingenuity that is quite marvellous, or a stolidity that is more\r\nmarvellous still. All these great masters of Greek might be generals or\r\nmere jurists, sculptors or fishmongers, for any allusion that he makes\r\nto the means by which they won their fame.\r\n\r\nFootnote 196:\r\n\r\n  V. 146-202.\r\n\r\nEverybody hopes that Plutarch did not write the _Malignity of\r\nHerodotus_.[197] But somebody wrote it: and while the general [Sidenote:\r\n_The_ Malignity of Herodotus.] handling is by no means alien from\r\nPlutarch’s the tractate, even if apocryphal, very adequately represents\r\nthe attitude of no inconsiderable section of Greek men of letters to\r\nliterature. Silly as it is, it illustrates rather usefully the curious\r\n_parochiality_ of the Greeks, to some extent visible even at their best\r\ntime, but naturally far more noticeable when that best time was over.\r\nHerodotus spoke disrespectfully of Bœotians: Plutarch was a\r\nBœotian; woe to Herodotus. This kind of attitude is strange to\r\nEnglishmen, who generally think far too well of themselves and their\r\ncountry to care what any poor outside creature says of it or them. But\r\nit is not unknown in some of the less predominant partners of the\r\nassociated British Empire; it is notoriously very strong in America; and\r\nit is the rule, rather than the exception, on the Continent of Europe.\r\nIt is, however, perhaps the worst mood in the world for literary\r\ncriticism; and Plutarch, never strong there, is never weaker than here.\r\nHe lets slip indeed, at the beginning, an interesting admission that\r\nHerodotus was generally thought to combine, with other good qualities, a\r\npeculiar facility in the reading of men, and a fluent pen. This is a\r\nliterary criticism, and we may expect it to be met with retort in kind.\r\nBut it is the nasty underhand temper that he wishes to exhibit.\r\nHerodotus, it seems, always uses the most damaging expressions; he drags\r\nin people’s misdeeds when they have nothing to do with the story, he\r\nomits their merits, he takes the worst views when more charitable ones\r\nwere possible, and so forth. Which general charges are supported by an\r\nostensibly careful examination of particular passages throughout the\r\nhistory. Comparisons complimentary to Thucydides are often made, but of\r\nthe literary differences of the two great historians there is scarcely a\r\nword. Only at the end, as at the beginning, there is a curious kind of\r\nextorted confession. The pen is graphic and the style is sweet, and\r\nthere is grace and freshness and cleverness in the narrative. But you\r\nmust take heed of his κακοήθεια as of a Spanish fly among roses.\r\n_Habemus confitentem, O Plutarche!_\r\n\r\nFootnote 197:\r\n\r\n  V. 208-263. “Bad-bloodedness” is perhaps more equal than “malignity”\r\n  to κακοήθεια.\r\n\r\nThe _Placita Philosophorum_ are as barren as the _Oratorum Vitæ_, but\r\nthe “Comparison between Aristophanes and Menander,”[198] [Sidenote: _The\r\n\"Comparison of Aristophanes and Menander.\"_] though only an extract or\r\nabstract, may seem as if it could not deceive us. That the result is the\r\ndepreciation of the greater writer and the exaltation of the smaller one\r\ndoes not matter much: we must not judge a critic by our agreement with\r\nthe _sense_ of his criticism. And it may be admitted that the\r\ntechnicalities of the art, which in other places are always\r\nincomprehensibly absent, do put in some appearance here. But though\r\nthere is even some critical jargon,[199] there is no critical grasp. We\r\nare told with a shower of additional epithets that Aristophanes is\r\nφορτικὸς καὶ θυμελικὸς καὶ βάναυσος, the first and last of these words\r\ncorresponding to different sides of our “vulgar,” while the second means\r\n“smacking of the _thymele_,” “theatrical,” “stagey”; that Menander’s\r\nstyle is “one, despite its variety,” free from puns and other naughty\r\nthings. But here also the ethical side is what really engages the\r\ncritic. Aristophanes is harsh, he is shocking, he degrades his subjects;\r\nMenander is graceful, full of instructive sentiment and common-sense.\r\nAnd the genius? Plutarch is quite frank on that point. He says, καὶ οὐκ\r\nοιδ' ὲν οἷς ἔστιν ἡ θρυλουμένη δεξιότης—\"I really don’t know where the\r\nmuch-talked-of cleverness comes in.\" Alas! that “speaks” him.\r\n\r\nFootnote 198:\r\n\r\n  V. 203-207.\r\n\r\nFootnote 199:\r\n\r\n  The late Professor Nettleship, as noted already, was the first, I\r\n  think, to put together a list of these stock terms, which is not\r\n  uninteresting. It will be further referred to in the next Book.\r\n\r\nNo different conclusion will be reached wherever we look in the great\r\ncollection of the _Moralia_. Take, for instance, the [Sidenote: _The_\r\nRoman Questions.] _Roman Questions_.[200] It may be said that these are\r\nconfessedly _in alia materia_, but the objection is hasty. We have seen\r\nthat Plutarch, in the preface to his _Lives_ of Demosthenes and Cicero,\r\npleads his scanty acquaintance with Latin as an excuse for not\r\nattempting one of the most obvious and interesting of things, one,\r\nmoreover, almost peremptorily demanded of him—that is to say, the\r\nliterary comparison of the two greatest orators, of two of the greatest\r\nprose writers, of Greece and Rome respectively. Yet we see from these\r\n_Roman Questions_ that, when the subject really interested him, he could\r\npry into Latin matters, of the obscurest and most out-of-the-way kind,\r\nwith unwearied labour and curiosity, and with a great deal of acuteness\r\nto boot. Not an eccentric rite of Latin religion, not a quaint bit of\r\nLatin folk-lore, not a puzzling social custom at Rome, can he meet with\r\nand hear of, but he hunts up the history and literature of it, turns it\r\nover and over in his mind, has traditional or conjectural explanations\r\nof it, treats it with all the affectionate diligence of the critical\r\ncommentator. And yet he is afraid or indisposed to attempt a literary\r\nestimate of the authors of the two _Philippics_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 200:\r\n\r\n  II. 250-320. The Greek title αἴτια is rather “cause” than “question.”\r\n  But Philemon Holland’s translation of 1603 (recently reprinted, with\r\n  an introduction by Mr F. B. Jevons, London, 1892) has naturalised this\r\n  latter version in English.\r\n\r\nThe much larger _Symposiacs_[201] tell the same story, no longer\r\nindirectly, but, as it were, aloud and open-mouthed. There are\r\n[Sidenote: _The_ Symposiacs.] nine books of them; ten or a dozen\r\nquestions, sometimes more, are discussed in each book, often at\r\nconsiderable length. Table-talk among the Greeks and Romans was\r\nnotoriously inclined in a literary direction.[202] But Plutarch’s\r\ntable-talk is nothing so little as it is literary. The customs and\r\netiquette of conviviality; the proceedings, proper or not proper, at and\r\nafter a good dinner; the physical qualities of foods and wines, receive\r\nnatural, full, and curious treatment. Sometimes the writer allows his\r\nfancy the remotest excursions, as in the famous debate whether the bird\r\ncomes before the egg or the egg before the bird. He discusses\r\nphilosophy, physics, physic; he inquires whether sea-water will or (like\r\na more sophisticated product) will not wash clothes; appraises the\r\nquality of jests; considers whether meat gets high sooner in moonlight\r\nor sunlight; and whether there is more echo by day or by night. But amid\r\nall this expatiation he seems to avoid literature as if it were Scylla\r\nand Charybdis in one. If he draws anywhere near the subject, it is to\r\ntreat it in the least literary way possible. We see the name of Homer in\r\nthe title of a chapter, and begin to hope for something to our point.\r\nBut Plutarch is only anxious to know why, when Homer mentions games, he\r\nputs boxing first, then wrestling, and running last. We find in one of\r\nthe prefaces (that to Book V.) a scornful glance at φορτικοὶ καὶ\r\nἀφιλόλογοι, who tell riddles and so forth after dinner. But, alas! the\r\nbook itself practises “Philology” in a way that is of very little good\r\nto us. It does indeed open with the old and still unsettled question why\r\nthe dramatic and literary treatment of painful things is pleasant; but\r\nthis is a question rather of philosophy than of literature. It starts\r\nthe inquiry whether prizes for poetry at festivals are of great\r\nantiquity; but this is mere antiquarianism. When it is for a moment\r\nactually “philological,” inquiring into epithets like ζωρότερον and\r\nἀγλαόκαρπον and ὑπέρφλοια, it is always the bare meaning, the\r\napplication, and so forth, that is attended to. When, for instance,\r\nPlutarch discusses the second word, he does not so much as touch that\r\ngeneral question of Greek compound epithets which Mr Matthew Arnold\r\ntouches (and begs) in a well-known passage.[203] He does not even glance\r\nat the grace, the beauty, the harmony of the word itself. He only wants\r\nto know why the poet specially applies this term to apple-trees, and why\r\nEmpedocles selects apples themselves for the other epithet, ὑπέρφλοια.\r\nNay, in discussing this last he gives a kind of indirect slap at the\r\nnotion of an epithet being selected for the sake of “pretty writing and\r\nblooming colour.”[204] And so everywhere. It is not too much to say that\r\nPlutarch _invariably_ avoids when he can, and when he accidentally\r\napproaches it, despatches in as unliterary a manner as possible, the\r\nbusiness of the literary critic. If he does not (as there is some\r\nwarrant for thinking he did) positively undervalue and almost despise\r\nthis, he clearly regards it as something for which he himself has no\r\nvocation and in which he feels no interest. And then they make him the\r\nauthor of the Περὶ Ὕψους!\r\n\r\nFootnote 201:\r\n\r\n  IV. 1-395.\r\n\r\nFootnote 202:\r\n\r\n  We are, however, by no means so fortunate (from the point of view of\r\n  this book) in our remains of Greek Symposiacs as we are in those of\r\n  Latin. The famous _Deipnosophists_ of Athenæus, in which, about 230\r\n  A.D., its invaluable author accumulated (under the guise of a\r\n  conversation in which persons of the importance of Ulpian and Galen\r\n  took part) the most enormous miscellany of quotation, anecdote, and\r\n  _quodlibeta_, in ancient if not in all literature, is, of course, for\r\n  all its want of literary form, a priceless book. As a storehouse of\r\n  quotation it has no rival but the _Anatomy of Melancholy_: and though\r\n  it is, in spirit, unity, literary gifts, and almost everything else,\r\n  as far below the _Anatomy_ as one book can be below another, it is\r\n  from this special point of view to be preferred to it, because the\r\n  vast majority of its sources of quotation are lost. For the history of\r\n  literature, as for that of manners, it is a mine of wealth; for the\r\n  history of literary criticism almost barren. For expression Athenæus\r\n  seems to have had no care at all, though his curiosity as to matter\r\n  was insatiable, and as nearly as possible indiscriminate. His spirit\r\n  is exactly that of the scholiasts referred to in a former page; and\r\n  whether he is discussing the varieties of vegetables and wines and\r\n  oysters, or the highly spiced and salted witticisms of Athenian ladies\r\n  of pleasure, or any other subject, he hardly becomes a critic for one\r\n  moment, though no critic can neglect him. Perhaps the nearest approach\r\n  to sustained critical remark is the captious attack on Plato at the\r\n  end of the 11th book, which is as feeble as it is captious. (The\r\n  standard edition of Athenæus is still that of Schweighaüser (14 vols.,\r\n  Argentorati, 1801-7); but those who suffer from inadequate shelf-room\r\n  may have (as the present writer long ago had regretfully) to expel\r\n  this in favour of the far less handsome and useful, but compacter, one\r\n  of Dindorf (3 vols. Leipsic, 1827).)\r\n\r\nFootnote 203:\r\n\r\n  _On Translating Homer_, §§ 1, 2 _passim_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 204:\r\n\r\n  καλλιγραφίας ἕνεκα—ὥσπερ ἀνθηροῖς χρώμασι.\r\n\r\nTo say that Lucian[205] is the Aristophanes of post-Christian Greek may\r\nseem a feeble and obvious attempt at epigram. But, so far as criticism\r\nis concerned, it has a propriety [Sidenote: _Lucian._] which takes it\r\nout of the category of the forcible-feeble. Not only are the two writers\r\nalike (giving weight for age) in the purity of their respective styles;\r\nnot only are they alike in the all-dissolving irony and the staunch\r\nToryism of their satire on innovations; but their critical attitudes are\r\n(when once more due allowance has been made for circumstances and\r\nseasons) curiously similar. Neither is a literary critic first of all or\r\nby profession,—though Lucian’s date, the state of literature in his\r\ntime, and his being in the main a prose writer, give him a sort of\r\n“false air” of being this. Both dislike innovations of phrase, at least\r\nas much because they are innovations as because they are actually in bad\r\ntaste. Both hate “conceit,” and neologism, at least as vehemently\r\nbecause such things happen to be associated with opinions obnoxious to\r\nthem as because they dislike the things themselves. And consequently\r\n(though again, for reasons easily given, less apparently in Lucian’s\r\ncase than in Aristophanes), the critical work of both, though displaying\r\nastonishing acuteness, is rather a special phase, a particular function\r\nof a general attitude of satiric contemplation of life, than criticism\r\npure and simple. In both, yet again, the combination of critical\r\ntemperament and literary power makes what they have to say on the\r\nsubject of extraordinary interest. Yet once more, in this case as in the\r\nformer, the interest lies a little outside the path of strict criticism.\r\nWhat Lucian has to tell us is perhaps best, as it is certainly most\r\nmemorably, summed up in the epigram attributed to him (and I am sure not\r\nunworthily) in the _Anthology_—\r\n\r\n          “Lucian wrote this, knowing old things and vain—\r\n            For vain is also that which men think wise:\r\n          No human thought is wholly clear and plain;\r\n            What thou ador’st is scorn in others' eyes.”[206]\r\n\r\nWe do not get much beyond this cheerful doctrine in his more directly\r\ncritical utterances. Much acuteness has been ascribed to the πῶς δεῖ\r\nἱστορίαν συγγράφειν.[207] But one had [Sidenote: _The_ How to Write\r\nHistory.] hardly need be a Lucian to see that the historian (or anybody\r\nelse) must understand his subject, and know how to set it forth: though\r\nit may be very freely granted that a strict application of the doctrine\r\nwould make considerable gaps on the shelves of libraries, or rather\r\nwould leave very few books on them. Indeed the whole tractate, though\r\nvery sound sense, is in more ways than one a prologue to the _True\r\nHistory_. And from its opening account of the unlucky Abderites and\r\ntheir epidemic of tragedy, through its application of the story of\r\nDiogenes rolling his tub, to its demure assertion at the end that the\r\ntub _is_ rolled, the irony is sufficiently apparent.\r\n\r\nFootnote 205:\r\n\r\n  I use the Tauchnitz edition, by Dindorf, 3 vols., Leipsic, 1858.\r\n\r\nFootnote 206:\r\n\r\n  This is fairly close, I think, but the two first lines, at any rate,\r\n  are too perfect not to be quoted in their own tongue—\r\n\r\n             Λουκιανὸς τάδ´ ἔγραφε, παλαιά τε μωρά τε εἰδῶς·\r\n               μωρὰ γὰρ ἀνθρώποις καὶ τὰ δοκοῦντα σοφά,\r\n\r\n  lines which grave themselves on the memory at twenty, and at fifty are\r\n  only graven deeper.\r\n\r\nFootnote 207:\r\n\r\n  II. 1-24.\r\n\r\nIf the “How to Write History” is chiefly concerned with matter, the\r\n_Lexiphanes_[208] is, with at least equal thoroughness, devoted\r\n[Sidenote: _The_ Lexiphanes.] to words. The comedy here is of a\r\ndifferent kind, broader, but hardly less subtle. The play on αὐχμὸς\r\n(“dry”) and νεοχμὸς (“newfangled”), the taste which Lexiphanes gives at\r\nonce of his preciousness by the use of the word κυψελόβυστα\r\n(“wax-stuffed”), his superb contempt for irony,[209] with his\r\ninterlocutor’s audacious punning and sham reverence, “set” the piece at\r\nonce for us. The wonderful lingo which Lexiphanes proceeds to pour forth\r\nin his “Anti-symposium” is matter for another inquiry than this; but the\r\nsubsequent criticism of it by Lycinus and Sopolis is quite within our\r\ncompetence. And there is nowhere any sounder prophylactic against one of\r\nthe recurrent diseases of literature, an access of which has been on us,\r\nas it happens, for a considerable time past. There are other diseases,\r\nof course—affected archaism, affected purism, &c. But this particular\r\none of “raising language to a higher power,” as it has been called by\r\nsome of those afflicted (and pleased) with it in our days, has never\r\nbeen better characterised. “Before all things,” says Lycinus, “prythee\r\nremember me this, not to mimic the worst inventions of modern\r\nrhetoricians, and smack your lips over them,[210] but to trample on\r\nthem, and emulate the great classical examples. Nor let the wind-flowers\r\nof speech bewitch you, but, after the manner of men in training, stick\r\nto solid food. Sacrifice first of all to the Goddess Clearness and to\r\nthe Graces by whom you are quite deserted. Bid avaunt! to bombast and\r\nmagniloquence, to tricks of speech. Do not turn up your nose, and strain\r\nyour voice, and jeer at others, and think that carping at everybody else\r\nwill put yourself in the front rank. Nay, you have another fault, not\r\nsmall, but perhaps your greatest, that you do not first arrange the\r\nmeaning of your expressions, and then dress them up in word and phrase;\r\nbut if you can pick up anywhere some outlandish locution, or invent one\r\nthat seems pretty to you, you try to tack a meaning on to it, and are\r\nmiserable if you cannot stuff it in somewhere, though it may have no\r\nnecessary connection with what you have to say.”[211] It would be\r\nimpossible to put more forcibly or better the necessary caution, the\r\nDevil’s Advocate’s plea, against the abuse and exaggeration of the\r\ndoctrine of the “beautiful word.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 208:\r\n\r\n  II. 144-152.\r\n\r\nFootnote 209:\r\n\r\n  τὸν μὲν εἴρωνα πέδοι κατάβαλε.\r\n\r\nFootnote 210:\r\n\r\n  Or “nibble at them.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 211:\r\n\r\n  _Lex._, § 24, ii. 152, _op. cit._\r\n\r\nThe “Indictment of the Vowels”[212] is rather a grammatical and\r\nrhetorical _jeu d’esprit_ than a criticism; but if the curious\r\n[Sidenote: _Other pieces: The_ Prometheus Es.] little piece, “To one who\r\nsaid 'You are the Prometheus of Prose,'”[213] were a little longer and\r\nmore explicit, it would give us rather a firmer hold of Lucian’s serious\r\nviews of literature than we have actually got. At first he plays, in his\r\nusual manner, with the notion of his real or invented flatterer. Are his\r\nworks called Promethean because they are of clay? He sorrowfully admits\r\nthe justice of the comparison. Or because they are so clever? This is\r\nsarcastic; and besides he has no wish to deserve the Caucasus. After\r\nall, too, it is a dubious compliment, for did not a comic writer call\r\nCleon “a Prometheus”? Then he drolls variously on the “potter’s art”\r\nattributed to him, the slightness of his work, the ease with which it\r\ncan be smashed, &c. But, perhaps there _is_ a complimentary meaning—that\r\nLucian, like Prometheus, is an inventor—that his books are not merely to\r\npattern. He does not altogether reject the soft impeachment, though he\r\nhastens (in harmony with that conclusion of the _Lexiphanes_ which has\r\nbeen just quoted) to say that mere novelty is no merit in his eyes. And\r\nthis he proceeds to illustrate, in his own manner, by a story of the\r\nblack camel and the magpie-coloured man that Ptolemy brought to Egypt,\r\nwith the result that the Egyptians thought the camel frightful and the\r\nmagpie-man a rather disgusting joke. But he has, he admits, attempted to\r\nadjust the philosophical dialogue to something like the tone of the\r\ncomic poets, to avoid the faults of both, and to adjust their\r\nexcellences. At any rate, says he, with one of his inimitable changes,\r\nPrometheus was a thief, and he, Lucian, is not. Nobody can call him a\r\nplagiarist, and he must stick to his art, such as it is, for otherwise\r\nhe were Epimetheus if he changed his mind. In this quaint glancing\r\nmixture of the serious and the sarcastic, it is possible to guess a good\r\ndeal, but guessing, as I have ventured to announce pretty prominently,\r\nis not the object of this book.\r\n\r\nFootnote 212:\r\n\r\n  I. 26.\r\n\r\nFootnote 213:\r\n\r\n  I. 9.\r\n\r\nTo Rhetoric, as distinguished from literary criticism proper, Lucian’s\r\nchief (indeed his only considerable and substantive) contribution is the\r\nso-called “Master of the Orators,”[214] [Sidenote: _Works touching\r\nRhetoric._] to which may be added a μελέτη or declamation on one of the\r\nstock subjects (a case of tyrannicide) and some parts of the “Twice\r\nAccused Man.”[215] This last is a curious _pot-pourri_ of satire on the\r\ndifferent schools of philosophy, on the methods of the law courts, and\r\non forensic eloquence. Rhetoric herself appears, besides an\r\nimpersonation of Dialogue, both in the character of public prosecutors\r\nagainst “the Syrian.” Rhetoric states that he has deserted her for\r\nDialogue, Dialogue that he has disgraced and shamed him by burlesque.\r\nNow Lucian, it is hardly necessary to say, was a Syrian, and had been a\r\nprofessional teacher of Rhetoric himself. The piece is chiefly parody,\r\nespecially in the two speeches just mentioned, where Lucian displays\r\nthat faculty of causing his characters to make themselves ridiculous, in\r\nwhich he has had no rival (except the authors of the _Satire Menippée_\r\nand Butler), to admiration. The reasons given by the “Syrian” for\r\ndeserting Rhetoric are also very funny.\r\n\r\nFootnote 214:\r\n\r\n  III. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 215:\r\n\r\n  II. 358.\r\n\r\nBut the whole has only a partial connection with literature, and is even\r\nmore concerned with the degradation of the Rhetorical profession than\r\nwith Rhetoric herself. Incidentally, however, it shows the strong\r\nattraction of that subject, warped and mismanaged as it was, for persons\r\nwith the literary interest in them. If Rhetoric could have seen herself\r\nas she ought to be—even as she is in Longinus—it is pretty certain that\r\nLucian would not have said the hard things against her which here\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nThe “Master of the Rhetors” or Orators is in the common form of\r\nrhetorical treatises, the form of the Περὶ Ὕψους itself, that of an\r\naddress to a young friend. This young friend had asked how a man might\r\nbecome a rhetor and a sophist, a position and title which he thought the\r\nnoblest of all. Lucian has not the least objection to tell him, so let\r\nhim listen. He shall climb the steep easily and rest on the heights,\r\nwhile others are tumbling down and cracking their crowns. Let there be\r\nno doubt about this. Poetry is a more difficult thing than rhetoric, and\r\ndid not Hesiod master it by just plucking a few leaves from Helicon? Did\r\nnot a merchant show Alexander a short cut from Persia to Egypt, only the\r\nunbelieving Macedonian would not listen? Lucian will be that merchant.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to Rhetoric (see Cebes on another matter). One (to\r\ncut short the abundant and agreeable “chaff” of which, here as\r\nelsewhere, Lucian is so prodigal) is the long, troublesome, and\r\nungrateful imitation of the mighty men of antiquity, of Plato and\r\nDemosthenes and the rest. The other, dealt with more copiously and more\r\nironically still, is quite different. You learn a few fashionable\r\ncatchwords for ordinary use, and some precious archaisms for occasional\r\nornament; you must get rid of all bashfulness, dress yourself very well,\r\ncultivate the vices which happen to be in vogue, or at any rate pretend\r\nto them, and keep a good deal of company with women and servants, for\r\nboth are babblesome and seldom at a loss. There is nothing hard in this\r\nand other precepts; and if you observe them, you will soon become a\r\nfamous orator. Very good fun all of it, and very shrewd “criticism of\r\nlife,” no doubt, but only distantly connected with criticism of\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nYet it requires no hazardous conjecture to discern a very considerable\r\nliterary critic in Lucian, and to discover the [Sidenote: _His critical\r\nlimitations._] reason why that critic did not come out in himself or in\r\nhis contemporaries, unless we are to rank the lonely and magnificent\r\npersonality of Longinus among these. There was interesting literature in\r\nLucian’s time—it is enough to mention the name of Apuleius to establish\r\nthat proposition—but hardly any of it was exactly great, and the best of\r\nit was marred, either by the negative tendency which is one side of\r\ndespair of greatness, or else by the hectic colours of decadence, or by\r\nthe dubious struggles of new tendencies not yet quite ready to be born.\r\nLucian himself (at any rate, after that youth of which we know so\r\nlittle) inclined, it is not necessary to say, to the negative side. He\r\nwas distinctly deficient in enthusiasm (with which, perhaps, the\r\ncritical artist can dispense as little as the creative), and had small\r\nfeeling for poetry. His admiration for the great Attic prose writers,\r\nand its result in his own delightful style, are obvious enough; while\r\nthe justice, if also the rigour, of his onslaughts on the\r\ncharacteristics most opposed to theirs, the characteristics of florid,\r\n“conceited,” neologistic prose and verse, cannot be denied. But the\r\nunsatisfactory negation of his religious and philosophical criticism\r\nextends also to his literary attitude. “Cannot you,” one feels inclined\r\nto say, “find something to say _for_ as well as against luxuriance of\r\nfancy, wealth of colour, delicate suggestiveness of thought and phrase?”\r\nCannot you, like Longinus, admit that Nature meant men to think and\r\nwrite magnificently of the magnificent? He could not, or he would not:\r\nhis very interest in literature as literature seems to have been\r\nlukewarm. And so the greatest writer of all the later Greeks, a writer\r\ngreat enough to rank with all but the very greatest of the earlier,\r\ngives us very little but carping criticism of literature, and not much\r\neven of that.\r\n\r\nIt does not fall within the plan of this work to examine at any length\r\nthe recently much-debated question whether the [Sidenote: _Longinus: the\r\ndifficulties raised._] treatise Περὶ Ὕψους is, as after its first\r\npublication by Robortello in 1554 it was for nearly three centuries\r\nunquestioningly taken to be, the work of the rhetorician Longinus, who\r\nwas Queen Zenobia’s Prime Minister, and was put to death by Aurelian. It\r\nhas been the mania of the nineteenth century to prove that everybody’s\r\nwork was written by somebody else, and it will not be the most useless\r\ntask of the twentieth to betake itself to more profitable inquiries.\r\nReferences which will enable any one who cares to investigate the matter\r\nare given in a note.[216] Here it may be sufficient to say two things.\r\nThe first is, that these questions appertain for settlement, less to the\r\ntechnical expert than to the intelligent _judex_, the half-juryman,\r\nhalf-judge, who is generally acquainted with the rules of logic and the\r\nlaws of evidence. The second is, that the verdict of the majority of\r\nsuch _judices_ on this particular question is, until some entirely new\r\ndocuments turn up, likely to be couched in something like the following\r\nform:—\r\n\r\n1. The positive evidence for the authorship of Longinus is very weak,\r\nconsisting in MS. attributions, the oldest of which[217] is irresolute\r\nin form, while it certainly does not date earlier than the tenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n2. There is absolutely no _evidence_ against the authorship of Longinus,\r\nonly a set of presumptions, most of which are sheer opinion, and carry\r\nno weight except as such. Moreover, no plausible competitor has even\r\nbeen hinted at. I hope it is not illiberal to say that the suggestion of\r\nPlutarch, which was made by Vaucher, and has met with some favour,\r\ncarries with it irresistible evidence that the persons who make it know\r\nlittle about criticism. No two things could possibly be more different\r\nthan the amiable ethical knack of the author of the _Moralia_, and the\r\nintense literary gift of the author of the Περὶ Ὕψους.\r\n\r\nFootnote 216:\r\n\r\n  The most elaborate discussion of the whole matter still is that of\r\n  Vaucher (Geneva, 1854). The editions I myself use are those of Toup\r\n  (Oxford, 1778); Egger (Paris, 1837), a particularly handy little\r\n  volume, _with the fragments_; and Prof. Rhys Roberts (Cambridge,\r\n  1899), with translation and full editorial apparatus. Those who do not\r\n  read the Greek lose much: but they will find a good (though somewhat\r\n  too free) translation, with an excellent introduction by Mr Andrew\r\n  Lang, in the work of Mr H. L. Havell (London, 1890).\r\n\r\nFootnote 217:\r\n\r\n  Διονυσίου ἢ Λογγίνου of the Paris MS. 2036. (Others even have\r\n  ἀνωνύμου.) Robortello intentionally or unintentionally dropped the η,\r\n  thereby putting students off the scent.\r\n\r\nAnother of the “Academic questions” connected with the book, however, is\r\nof more literary importance, and that is its [Sidenote: “_Sublimity_.”]\r\nproper designation in the modern languages. There has been a consensus\r\nof the best authorities of late years, even though they may not agree on\r\nother points, that “The Sublime” is a far from happy translation of\r\nὕψος. Not only has “Sublime” in the modern languages, and especially in\r\nEnglish, a signification too much specialised, but the specialisation is\r\npartly in the wrong direction. No one, for instance, who uses English\r\ncorrectly, however great his enthusiasm for the magnificent Sapphic ode\r\nwhich Longinus has had the well-deserved good fortune to preserve to us,\r\nwould call it exactly sublime,[218] there being, in the English\r\nconnotation of that word, an element of calmness, or at any rate (for a\r\nstorm may be sublime) of mastery, which is absent here. And so in other\r\ncases; “Sublime” being more especially unfortunate in bringing out (what\r\nno doubt remains to some extent in any case) the inadequateness and\r\ntautology of the attempts to define the _sources_ of ὕψος. Hall, the\r\nseventeenth-century translator, avoided these difficulties by a simple\r\nrendering, “the height of eloquence,” which is more than literally\r\nexact, though it is neither elegant nor handy. Nor is there perhaps any\r\nsingle word that is not open to almost as many objections as Sublime\r\nitself. So that (and again this is the common conclusion) it is well to\r\nkeep it, with a very careful preliminary explanation that the Longinian\r\nSublime is not sublimity in its narrower sense, but all that quality, or\r\ncombination of qualities, which creates _enthusiasm_ in literature, all\r\nthat gives _consummateness_ to it, all that deserves the highest\r\ncritical encomium either in prose or poetry.\r\n\r\nFootnote 218:\r\n\r\n  Blair saw this, but, with the ill-luck of his century, regarded the\r\n  work as merely “elegant.”\r\n\r\nFew persons, however, whom the gods have made critical will care to\r\nspend much time _in limine_ over the authorship, [Sidenote: _Quality and\r\ncontents of the treatise._] the date,[219] the title, and the other\r\nbeggarly elements in respect to this astonishing treatise. Incomplete as\r\nit is—and its incompleteness is as evident as that of the _Poetics_, and\r\nprobably not much less substantial—difficult as are some of its terms,\r\ndeprived as we are in some cases of the power of appreciating its\r\ncitations fully, through our ignorance of their context, puzzled as we\r\nmay even be now and then by that radical difference in taste and\r\nview-point, that “great gulf fixed,” which sometimes, though only\r\nsometimes, does interpose itself between modern and ancient,—no student\r\nof criticism, hardly one would think any fairly educated and intelligent\r\nman, can read a dozen lines of the book without finding himself in a new\r\nworld, as he compares it with even the best of his earlier critical\r\nmasters. He is in the presence of a man who has accidentally far greater\r\nadvantages of field than Aristotle, essentially far more powerful\r\ngenius, and an intenser appreciation of literature, than Dionysius or\r\nQuintilian. And probably the first thought—not of the student, who will\r\nbe prepared for it, but of the fairly educated man who knows something\r\nof Pope and Boileau and the rest of them—will be, “How on earth did this\r\nbook come to be quoted as an authority by a school like that of the\r\n‘classical’ critics of the seventeenth-eighteenth century, whose every\r\nprinciple almost, whose general opinions certainly, it seems to have\r\nbeen designedly written to crush, conclude, and quell?” Of this more\r\nhereafter. Let us begin, as in former important cases, by a short\r\nabstract of the actual contents of the book.\r\n\r\nFootnote 219:\r\n\r\n  Longinus (? 213-273) represents the middle of the _third_ century.\r\n  Nobody puts it later than this, and nobody earlier than the _first_.\r\n\r\nThe author commences by addressing a young friend or pupil, a certain\r\nPostumius (Terentianus or Florentianus?), on the inefficiency of the\r\nTreatise on the Sublime by a certain Cæcilius.[220] In endeavouring to\r\nprovide something more satisfactory, especially as to the sources of\r\nSublimity, he premises little more in the shape of definition than that\r\nit is “a certain consummateness and eminence” of words, completing this\r\nwith the remark (the first epoch-making one of the treatise) that the\r\neffect of such things is “not persuasion but transport,”[221] not the\r\nresult of skill, pains, and arrangement, but something which,\r\n“opportunely out-flung,”[222] carries everything before it. But can it\r\nbe taught? Is it not innate? The doubt implies a fallacy. Nature is\r\nnecessary, but it must be guided and helped by art. Then comes a gap, a\r\nspecially annoying one, since the farther shore lands us in the midst of\r\nan unfavourable criticism of a passage supposed to come from the lost\r\n_Orithyia_ of Æschylus, which is succeeded by, or grouped with, other\r\nspecimens of the false sublime, bombast, tumidity, and the\r\n_parenthurson_.[223] Next we pass to “frigidity,” a term which Longinus\r\nuses with a slightly different connotation from Aristotle’s, applying it\r\nchiefly to what he thinks undue flings and quips and conceits. These\r\nparticular strictures are, in Chapter V., generalised off into a brief\r\nbut admirable censure of the quest for mere novelty, of that “horror of\r\nthe obvious” which bad taste at all times has taken for a virtue. To\r\ncure this and other faults, there is nothing for it but to make for the\r\ntrue Sublime, hard as it may be. For (again a memorable and epoch-making\r\nsaying) “the judgment of words is the latest begotten fruit of many an\r\nattempt.”[224]\r\n\r\nFootnote 220:\r\n\r\n  A Sicilian rhetor, probably of Calacte, said by Suidas to have been of\r\n  Greek, or at any rate non-Roman, birth, and a Jew in religion.\r\n  Dionysius knew him, and he lived in the time of Augustus. There was\r\n  another (confused by Suidas) in that of Hadrian. This _may_ be our C.\r\n\r\nFootnote 221:\r\n\r\n  οὐ γὰρ εἰς πειθὼ ἀλλ' ἐις ἔκστασιν ἄγει τὰ ὑπερφυᾶ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 222:\r\n\r\n  καιρίως ἐξενεχθέν.\r\n\r\nFootnote 223:\r\n\r\n  A phrase of the rhetor Theodorus, meaning “the thyrsus poked in at the\r\n  wrong time,” “enthusiasm out of place.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 224:\r\n\r\n  λόγων κρίσις πολλῆς ἐστι πείρας τελευταῖον ἐπιγέννημα. Dionysius (_v.\r\n  supra_, pp. 130, 131) had said as much in sense, but less\r\n  magisterially in phrase. I have translated λόγων in its narrowest\r\n  equivalent, instead of “style” or “literature,” which it doubtless\r\n  also means, in order to bring out the antithesis better. I have small\r\n  doubt that Longinus meant, here as elsewhere, to fling back the old\r\n  contempt of the opposition of “words” and “things.”\r\n\r\nThe first canon of sublimity is not unlike the famous _Quod Semper_, &c.\r\nIf a thing does not transport _at all_, it is certainly not Sublime. If\r\nits transporting power fails with repetition, with submission to\r\ndifferent but still competent judges, it is not sublime. When men\r\ndifferent in habits, lives, aims, ages, speech, agree about it, then no\r\nmistake is possible.\r\n\r\nThe sources of Sublimity are next defined as five in number: Command of\r\nstrong and manly thought; Vehement and enthusiastic passion—these are\r\ncongenital; Skilfulness with Figures; Nobility of phrase; Dignified and\r\nelevated _ordonnance_.[225] These, after a rebuke of some length to\r\nCæcilius for omitting Passion, he proceeds to discuss seriatim. The\r\nἁδρεπήβολον, which he now calls “great-naturedness,”[226] holds the\r\nfirst place in value as in order, and examples of it, and of the failure\r\nto reach it, are given from many writers, Homer and “the Legislator of\r\nthe Jews” being specially praised. This laudation leads to one of the\r\nbest known and most interesting passages of the whole book, a short\r\ncriticism and comparison of the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_, whereon, as\r\non other things in this abstract, more hereafter. The interest certainly\r\ndoes not sink with the quotation from Sappho, whether we agree or not\r\n(again _vide post_) that the source of its charm is “the selection and\r\ncomposition of her details.” Other typical passages are then cited and\r\ncriticised.\r\n\r\nFootnote 225:\r\n\r\n  This word, which has the stamp of Dryden, is often preferable to\r\n  “composition.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 226:\r\n\r\n  τὸ μεγαλοφυές.\r\n\r\nWe next come to Amplification,—almost the first evidence in the\r\ntreatise, and not a fatal one, of the numbing power of “Figures.”\r\nLonginus takes occasion by it for many illuminative animadversions, not\r\nmerely on Homer, but on Plato, Herodotus, Demosthenes, and Thucydides,\r\nwhom (it is very satisfactory to observe) he includes among those who\r\nhave “sublimity.” This handling of Figures, professedly eclectic, is\r\nfertile in such animadversions in regard to others besides\r\nAmplification—Hyperbata, Polyptota, Antimetathesis, and others\r\nstill—with especial attention to Periphrasis, to his praise of which the\r\neighteenth century perhaps attended without due attention to his\r\ncautions.\r\n\r\nThen comes another of the flashes of light. Dismissing the figures, he\r\nturns to diction in itself, and has a wonderful passage on it,\r\nculminating in the dictum, “For beautiful words are in deed and in fact\r\nthe very light of the spirit,”[227]—the Declaration of Independence and\r\nthe “Let there be light” at once of Literary Criticism.\r\n\r\nFootnote 227:\r\n\r\n  φῶς γὰρ τῷ ὄντι ἵδιον τοῦ νοῦ τὰ καλὰ ὁνόματα.\r\n\r\nHere the Enemy seems to have thought that he was getting too good, for\r\nanother and greater gap occurs, and when we are allowed to read again,\r\nwe are back among the Figures and dealing with Metaphor—the criticism of\r\nexamples, however, being still illuminative. It leads him, moreover, to\r\nanother of his nugget-grounds, the discussion on “Faultlessness,” which\r\nintroduces some especially valuable parallels—Apollonius and Homer,\r\nBacchylides and Pindar, Ion and Sophocles, Hyperides and Demosthenes,\r\nLysias and Plato. Then we pass to the figure Hyperbole after a gap, and\r\nthen to _ordonnance_ and arrangement, with a passage, valuable but, like\r\nall similar passages in the ancient critics, difficult, on rhythm. After\r\nthis a section on μικρότης—“littleness,” “triviality”—leads abruptly to\r\nthe close, which is not the close, and which, after some extremely\r\ninteresting remarks on the ethical and other conditions of the time,\r\nends with an unfulfilled promise of treating the subject of the\r\nPassions. The loss of this is perhaps more to be regretted than the loss\r\nof any other single tractate of the kind in antiquity. It might have\r\nbeen, and possibly was, only a freshening up of the usual rhetorical\r\ncommonplaces about the “colours of good and evil,” and the probable\r\ndisposition of the hearer or reader. But it might also, and from\r\nLonginus’s handling of the other stock subject of the Figures it is much\r\nmore likely to, have been something mainly, if not wholly, new: in fact,\r\nsomething that to this day we have not got—an analysis of the direct\r\nappeals of literature to the primary emotions of the soul.\r\n\r\nIn considering this inestimable book, it is hardly possible to\r\nexaggerate the importance of these early words of it to which attention\r\nhas been drawn above. The yoke of “persuasion” has at last been broken\r\nfrom the neck of the critic. He does not consider literature as\r\nsomething which will help a man to carry an assembly with him, to\r\npersuade a jury, to gain a declamation prize. He does indeed still\r\nmention the listener rather than the reader; but that is partly\r\ntradition, partly a consequence of the still existing prevalence of\r\nrecitation or reading aloud. Further, it is sufficiently evident that\r\nthe critic [Sidenote: _Preliminary Retrospect._] has come to regard\r\nliterature as a whole, and is not distracted by supposed requirements of\r\n“invention” on the part of the poet, of “persuasion” on the part of the\r\norator, and so forth. He looks at the true and only test of literary\r\ngreatness—the “transport,” the absorption of the reader. And he sees as\r\nno one, so far as we know, saw before him (except Dionysius for a moment\r\nand “in a glass darkly”), as Dante was the only man after him to see for\r\na millennium and much more, that the beautiful words, the “mots\r\nrayonnants,” are at least a main means whereby this effect is produced.\r\nInstead of style and its criticism being dismissed, or admitted at best\r\nwith impatience as something φορτικόν, we have that gravest and truest\r\njudgment of the latter as the latest-born offspring of many a painful\r\nendeavour. Far is it indeed from him to stick to the word only: his\r\nremarks on novelty, his peroration (not intended as such, but so coming\r\nto us), and many other things, are proof of that. But in the main his\r\ncriticism is of the pure æsthetic kind, and of the best of that kind. It\r\nwill not delay us too much to examine it a little more in detail.\r\n\r\nThe opening passage as to Cæcilius, though it has tempted some into\r\nperilous hypothetic reconstructions of that critic’s [Sidenote:\r\n_Detailed Criticism: The opening._] possible teaching, really comes to\r\nlittle more than this—that Longinus, like most of us, was not exactly\r\nsatisfied with another man’s handling of his favourite subject. And,\r\ncuriously enough, the only specific fault that he here finds—namely,\r\nthat his predecessor, while illustrating the nature of the Sublime\r\namply, neglected to discuss the means of reaching it—rather recoils on\r\nhimself. For there can be little doubt that the weakest part of the Περὶ\r\nὝψους is its discussion of “sources.” But the great phrase, already more\r\nthan once referred to, as to transport or ecstasy, not persuasion, lifts\r\nus at once—itself transports us—into a region entirely different from\r\nthat of all preceding Rhetorics, without at the same time giving any\r\nreason to fear loss of touch with the common ground and common-sense.\r\nFor nothing can be saner than the handling, in the second chapter, of\r\nthat _aporia_ concerning nature and art, genius and painstaking, which\r\nhas not infrequently been the cause of anything but sane writing.\r\n\r\nAfter the gap, however, we come to one of the passages recently glanced\r\nat, and mentioned or to be mentioned so [Sidenote: _The stricture on\r\nthe_ Orithyia.] often elsewhere, which warn us as to difference of view.\r\nThe passage, supposed to be, as we said, Æschylean and from the\r\n_Orithyia_, is no doubt at rather more than “concert-pitch.” It is\r\nMarlowe rather than Shakespeare; yet Shakespeare himself has come near\r\nto it in _Lear_ and elsewhere, and one line at least—\r\n\r\n                  μίαν παρείρας πλεκτάνην χειμάρῥοον—\r\n\r\nis a really splendid piece of metre and phrase, worthy, high-pitched as\r\nit is, of the author of the _Oresteia_ and the _Prometheus_ at his very\r\nbest. So, too, the much-enduring Gorgias would hardly have received very\r\nsevere reprehension from any but the extremest precisians of modern\r\ncriticism, at its most starched time, for calling vultures “living\r\ntombs.” But the horror of the Greeks on the one hand for anything\r\nextravagant, bizarre, out of measure, on the other for the slightest\r\napproach in serious work to the unbecoming, the unpleasantly suggestive,\r\nmakes Longinus here a very little prudish. And his general remarks are\r\nexcellent, especially in reference to τὸ παρένθυρσον, which I have\r\nventured to interpret, not quite in accordance with the general\r\nrendering, “the poking in of the thyrsus at the wrong time,” the\r\naffectation of Bacchanalian fury where no fury need be.\r\n\r\nBut we still have the same warning in the chapter on Frigidity, coupled\r\nwith another—that, perhaps, as sometimes happens, Longinus' sense of\r\nhumour was not quite [Sidenote: _Frigidity._] equal to his sense of\r\nsublimity, and yet another—that the historic sense, so late developed\r\neverywhere, was, perhaps, not very strong in him. We, at least, should\r\ngive Timæus the benefit of a doubt, as to the presence of a certain not\r\ninexcusable irony in the comparison (in which, for instance, neither\r\nSwift nor Carlyle would have hesitated to indulge) of the times taken by\r\nAlexander to conquer Asia and by Isocrates to write the _Panegyric_. On\r\nthe other hand, he seems to forget the date of Timæus when he finds the\r\nμικροχαρές, the paltrily funny, in the historian’s connection of the\r\nAthenian Hermocopidæ and their punishment by Hermocrates, the son of\r\nHermon. There is no reason why Timæus should not have been quite\r\nserious, though in the third century after Christ, and even in the\r\nfirst, the allusion might seem either a tasteless freethinking jest or a\r\nsilly piece of superstition.\r\n\r\nBut by far the most interesting thing in this context is Longinus'\r\nirreconcilable objection to a fanciful metaphor [Sidenote: _The “maidens\r\nin the eyes.”_] which, as it happens most oddly, was, with a very slight\r\nvariation, an equal pet of the Greeks of the great age and of our own\r\nElizabethans. Every reader of the latter knows the phrase, “to look\r\nbabies in the eyes” of the beloved—that is to say, to keep the face so\r\nclose to hers that the little reflections of the gazer in the pupils of\r\nher eyes are discernible. The Greek term for these little images, and\r\nthe pupils that mirrored them, was slightly different—it was κόραι,\r\nmaidens. And as, from the famous quarrel scene in Homer downwards, the\r\neyes were always, in Greek literature, the seat of modesty or of\r\nimpudence, the combination suggested, not merely to Timæus but even to\r\nXenophon, a play of words, “more modest than the maidens in their eyes,”\r\nor conversely, as where Timæus, speaking of the lawless lust of\r\nAgathocles, says that he must have had “harlots” (πόρνας), not “maidens”\r\n(κόρας), in his eyes. And Longinus is even more angry or sad with\r\nXenophon than with Timæus, as expecting more propriety from him.\r\n\r\nBut whether we agree with him in detail or not, the inestimable passage,\r\non the mere quest and craze for novelty, which [Sidenote: _The canon\r\n“Quod semper.”_] follows, more than reconciles us, as well as the other\r\ngreat saying in cap. vi. as to the “late-born” character of the judgment\r\nof style, and that in the next as to the canon of Sublimity being the\r\neffect produced unaltered in altered circumstances and cases. When we\r\nread these things we feel that literary criticism is at last fully\r\nconstituted,—that it wants nothing more save greater variety, quantity,\r\nand continuance of literary creation, upon which to exercise itself.\r\n\r\nNo nervous check or chill need be caused by the tolerably certain fact\r\nthat more than one hole may be picked in the [Sidenote: _The sources of\r\nsublimity._] subsequent classification of the sources[228] of ὕψος.\r\nThese attempts at an over-methodical classification (it has been said\r\nbefore) are always full of snares and pitfalls to the critic. Especially\r\ndo they tempt him to the sin of arguing in a circle. It cannot be denied\r\nthat in every one of the five divisions (except, perhaps, the valuable\r\nvindication of the quality of Passion) there is some treacherous word or\r\nother, which is a mere synonym of “sublime.” Thus in the first we have\r\nἁδρεπήβολον, mastery of the ἅδρον, a curious word, the nearest\r\nequivalent of which in English is, perhaps, “stout” or “full-bodied,” as\r\nwe apply these terms to wine; in the fourth γενναία, “noble,” which is\r\nonly “sublime” in disguise; and in the fifth εν δε φαει και ολεσσον, of\r\nwhich much the same may be said.\r\n\r\nFootnote 228:\r\n\r\n  It may, however, be plausibly argued that the circle is more apparent\r\n  than real, resulting from a kind of ambiguity in the word πηγαί. If\r\n  Longinus had slightly altered his expression, so as to make it\r\n  something of this kind, “There are five points [or ways, or aspects]\r\n  in which ὕψος may be attained, thought, feeling, ‘figure,’ diction,\r\n  and composition,” he would be much less vulnerable. And, after all,\r\n  this is probably what he meant.\r\n\r\nAny suggestion, however, of paralogism which might arise from this and\r\nbe confirmed by the curious introduction in the third of the Figures, as\r\nif they were machines for automatic sublime-coining, must be dispelled\r\nby the remarks on Passion of the right kind as tending to sublimity, and\r\nby the special stress laid on the primary necessity of μεγαλοφροσύνη,\r\nwhereof ὕψος itself is the mere ἀπήχημα or echo. Unfortunately here, as\r\nso often, the gap comes just in the most important place.\r\n\r\nWhen the cloud lifts, however, we find ourselves in one of the most\r\ninteresting passages of the whole, the selection of “sublime” passages\r\nfrom Homer. A little superfluous matter about Homer’s “impiety” (the\r\nold, the respectable, Platonic mistake) occurs; but it matters not,\r\nespecially in face of the two praises of the “Let there be light” of the\r\nJewish legislator, “no chance comer,” and of the great ἐν δὲ φάει καὶ\r\nὄλεσσον of Ajax, the mere juxtaposition of which once more shows what a\r\ncritic we have got in our hands.\r\n\r\nNot quite such a great one perhaps have we—yet one in the circumstances\r\nequally fascinating—in the contrasted remarks [Sidenote: _Longinus on\r\nHomer._] on the _Odyssey_. Longinus is not himself impious; he is no\r\nSeparatist (he is indeed far too good a critic to be that). But he will\r\nhave the Romance of Ulysses to be “old age, though the old age of\r\nHomer.” “When a great nature is a little gone under, philomythia is\r\ncharacteristic of its decline.”[229] Evidently, he thinks, the _Odyssey_\r\nwas Homer’s second subject, not his first. He is “a setting sun as\r\nmighty as ever, but less intense”: he is more unequal: he takes to the\r\nfabulous and the incredible. The Wine of Circe, the foodless voyage of\r\nUlysses, the killing of the suitors—nay, the very attention paid to\r\nCharacter and Manners—tell the tale of decadence.\r\n\r\nFootnote 229:\r\n\r\n  μεγάλης φύσεως ὑποφερομένης ἤδη ἰδιόν ἐστιν ἐν γήρᾳ τὸ φιλύμυθον.\r\n\r\nHe is wrong, undoubtedly wrong—we may swear it boldly by those who fell\r\nin Lyonnesse, and in the palace of Atli, and under the echoes of the\r\nhorn of Roland. The _Odyssey_ is not less than the _Iliad_; it is\r\ndifferent. But we can hardly quarrel with him for being wrong, because\r\nhis error is so instructive, so interesting. We see in it first (even\r\nside by side with not a little innovation) that clinging to the great\r\ndoctrines of old, to the skirts of Aristotle and of Plato, which is so\r\noften found in noble minds and so seldom in base ones. And we see,\r\nmoreover, that far as he had advanced—near as he was to an actual peep\r\nover the verge of the old world and into the new—he was still a Greek\r\nhimself at heart, with the foibles and limitations—no despicable foibles\r\nand limitations—of the race. Here is the instinctive unreasoning terror\r\nof the unknown Romance; the dislike of the vague and the fabulous; even\r\nthat curious craze about Character being in some way inferior to Action,\r\nwhich we have seen before. By the time of Longinus—if he lived in the\r\nthird century certainly, if he lived in the first probably—the romance\r\ndid exist. But it was looked upon askance; it had no regular literary\r\nrank; and a sort of resentment was apparently felt at its daring to\r\nclaim equality with the epic. Now the _Odyssey_ is the first, and not\r\nfar from the greatest, of romances. It has the Romantic Unity in the\r\nendurance and triumph of its hero. It has the Romantic Passion in the\r\nepisodes of Circe and Calypso and others: above all, it has the great\r\nRomantic breadth, the free sweep of scene and subject, the variety, the\r\ncontrast of fact and fancy, the sparkle and hurry and throb. But these\r\nthings, to men trained in the admiration of the _other_ Unity, the\r\n_other_ Passion, the more formal, regulated, limited, measured detail\r\nand incident of the usual tragedy and the usual epic—were at best\r\nunfamiliar innovations, and at worst horrible and daring impieties.\r\nLonginus will not go this length: he cannot help seeing the beauty of\r\nthe _Odyssey_. But he must reconcile his principles to his feelings by\r\ninventing a theory of decadence, for which, to speak frankly, there is\r\nno critical justification at all.\r\n\r\nOne may almost equally disagree with the _special_ criticism which\r\nserves as setting to the great jewel among the quotations [Sidenote: _On\r\nSappho._] of the treatise, the so-called “Ode to Anactoria.” The charm\r\nof this wonderful piece consists, according to Longinus, in the skill\r\nwith which Sappho chooses the accompanying emotions of “erotic\r\nmania.”[230] To which one may answer, “Hardly so,” but in the skill with\r\nwhich she expresses those emotions which she selects, and in the\r\nwonderful adaptation of the metre to the expression, in the mastery of\r\nthe picture of the most favoured lover, drawing close and closer to the\r\nbeloved to catch the sweet speech,[231] and the laughter full of desire.\r\nIn saying this we should have the support of the Longinus of other parts\r\nof the treatise against the Longinus of this. Yet here, too, he is\r\nilluminative; here, too, the “noble error” of the Aristotelian\r\nconception of poetry distinguishes and acquits him.\r\n\r\nFootnote 230:\r\n\r\n  Literal.\r\n\r\nFootnote 231:\r\n\r\n  Fond and foolish fancy as it may be, there seems to me something\r\n  miraculous in the mere juxtaposition of πλησίον and ἁδὺ—the silent\r\n  adoring lover, jealous, as it were, of the very air robbing him of a\r\n  portion of the sweetness.\r\n\r\nWith the remarks on αὔξησις, “amplification,” as it is traditionally but\r\nby no means satisfactorily rendered, another phase [Sidenote:\r\n“_Amplification._”] of the critical disease of antiquity (which is no\r\ndoubt balanced by other diseases in the modern critical body) may be\r\nthought to appear. Both in the definition of this figure and in the\r\ndescription of its method we may, not too suspiciously, detect evidences\r\nof that excessive technicality which gave to Rhetoric itself the\r\nexclusive title of _techne_. _Auxesis_, it seems, comes in when the\r\nbusiness, or the point at issue, admits at its various stages of divers\r\nfresh starts and rests, of one great phrase being wheeled upon the stage\r\nafter another, continually introduced in regular ascent.[232] This, it\r\nseems, can be done either by means of τοπηγορία, “handling of _topoi_ or\r\ncommonplaces,” or by δείνωσις, which may perhaps be best rendered _tour\r\nde force_, or by cunning successive disposition (ἐποικονομία) of facts\r\nor feelings. For, says he, there are ten thousand kinds of _auxesis_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 232:\r\n\r\n  ἕτερα ἑτέροις ἐπεισκυκλούμενα μεγέθη συνεχῶς ἐπεισάγηται κατ’\r\n  ἐπίβασιν.\r\n\r\nThe first description of the method will recall to all comparative\r\nstudents of literature the manner of Burke, though it is not exactly\r\nidentical with that manner; but the instances of means, besides being\r\nadmittedly inadequate, savour, with their technicalities of terminology,\r\nmuch too strongly of the cut-and-dried manual. The third article, on a\r\nreasonable interpretation of ἐποικονομία, really includes all that need\r\nbe said. But one sees here, as later, that even Longinus had not quite\r\noutgrown the notion that the teacher of Rhetoric was bound to present\r\nhis student with a sort of hand-list of “tips” and dodges—with the kind\r\nof Cabbala wherewith the old-fashioned crammer used to supply his pupils\r\nfor inscription on wristband or finger-nail. Yet he hastens to give a\r\nsign of grace by avowing his dissatisfaction with the usual Rhetorical\r\nview, and by distinguishing _auxesis_ and the Sublime itself, in a\r\nmanner which brings the former still nearer to Burke’s “winding into a\r\nsubject like a serpent,” and which might have been more edifying still\r\nif one of the usual gaps did not occur. Part, at least, of the lost\r\nmatter must have been occupied with a contrast or comparison between the\r\nmethods of Plato and Demosthenes, the end of which we have, and which\r\npasses into one between Demosthenes and Cicero. “If we Greeks may be\r\nallowed to have an opinion,” says Longinus, with demure humility,\r\n“Demosthenes shall be compared to a flash of thunder and lightning,\r\nCicero to an ordinary terrestrial conflagration,” which is very handsome\r\nto Cicero.\r\n\r\nThen he returns to Plato, and rightly insists that much of his splendour\r\nis derived from imitation, or at least from emulation, of that very\r\nHomer whom he so often attacks. The great writers of the past are to be\r\nconstantly before us, and we are not to be deterred from “letting\r\nourselves go” by any mistaken sense of inferiority, or any dread of\r\nposterity’s verdict.\r\n\r\nThen comes a digression of extreme importance on the subject of\r\nφαντασίαι or εἰδωλοποιΐαι—“images.” One of the points in which a history\r\nof the kind here attempted may [Sidenote: “_Images._”] prove to be of\r\nmost service, lies in the opportunity it affords of keeping the changes\r\nof certain terms, commonly used in criticism, more clearly before the\r\nmind than has always been done. And of these, none requires more care\r\nthan “Images” and “Imagination.” At the first reading, the mere use of\r\nsuch a word as φαντασίαι may seem to make all over-scrupulousness\r\nunnecessary, though if we remember that even Fancy is not quite\r\nImagination, the danger may be lessened. At any rate, it is nearly\r\ncertain that no ancient writer,[233] and no modern critic before a very\r\nrecent period (Shakespeare uses it rightly, but then he was Shakespeare\r\nand not a critic), attached our full sense to the term. To Aristotle\r\nφαντασία is merely αἴσθησις ἀσθενὴς, a “weakened sensation,” a copy\r\nfurnished by memory from sensation itself. Even animals have it. No idea\r\nof Invention seems to have mingled with it, or only of such invention as\r\nthe artist’s is when he faithfully represents natural objects. Of the\r\nImagination, which is in our minds when we call Shelley an imaginative\r\npoet, and Pope not one, Sir Edward Burne Jones an imaginative painter,\r\nand any contemporary whom it may be least invidious to name not one,\r\nthere does not seem to have been a trace even in the enthusiastic mind\r\nof Longinus, though he expressly includes Enthusiasm—nay, Passion—in his\r\nnotion of it. You think you see what you say, and you make your hearers\r\nsee it. Good; but Crabbe does that constantly, and one would hardly,\r\nsave in the rarest cases, call Crabbe imaginative. In short, φαντασίαι\r\nhere are vivid illustrations drawn from nature—Orestes’ hallucination of\r\nthe Eumenides, Euripides’ picture of Phaethon, that in the _Seven_ of\r\nthe slaying of the bull over the black-bound shield, and many others. No\r\ndoubt he glances at the fabulous and incredible, the actually\r\n“imagined”; but he seems, as in the case of the _Odyssey_, to be a\r\nlittle doubtful of these even in poetry, while in oratory he bars them\r\naltogether. You must at one and the same time reason and\r\nillustrate—again the very method of Burke.\r\n\r\nFootnote 233:\r\n\r\n  On the exception to be made for Philostratus, see above, p. 120.\r\n\r\nIn the rest of the illustrations of the use of Figures—for the central\r\npart of the treatise expressly disclaims being a formal [Sidenote: _The\r\nFigures._] discussion of these idols—the positive literary criticisms\r\nscattered in them—the actual “reviewing”—will give most of the interest.\r\nThe great Oath of Demosthenes, “By those who fell at Marathon!” with its\r\npossible suggestion by a passage of Eupolis, supplies a whole chapter\r\nand part of another. And now we find the curious expression (showing how\r\neven Longinus was juggled by terms) that Figures “fight on the side of\r\nthe Sublime, and in turn draw a wonderful reinforcement from it,”\r\nwherein a mighty if vague reality like the Sublime, and mere shadows\r\n(though neatly cut-out shadows) like the Figures, are most quaintly\r\nyoked together.\r\n\r\nThough still harassed by gaps, we find plenty of good pasture in the\r\nremarks, the handling of Periphrasis being especially attractive. For\r\nthe eighteenth century—the time which honoured Longinus most in theory,\r\nand went against him most in practice—undoubtedly took part of his\r\nadvice as to this figure. It had no doubt that Periphrasis contributed\r\nto the Sublime, was ὑψηλοποιόν: unluckily it paid less attention to his\r\nsubsequent caution, that it is a risky affair, and that it smells of\r\ntriviality.[234] In fact, it is extremely noticeable that in the\r\nexamples of Periphrasis which he praises we should hardly apply that\r\nname to it, but should call it “Allusion” or “Metaphor,” while the\r\nexamples that he condemns are actually of the character of Armstrong’s\r\n“gelid cistern” and Delille’s “game which Palamede invented.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 234:\r\n\r\n  ἐπίκηρον πρᾶγμα ... κουφολογίας ὄζον. ἐπίκηρος means literally\r\n  “perishable,” “apt to go off,” to get stale or flat.\r\n\r\nAt no time perhaps has the tricksy, if not (as one is almost driven to\r\nsuspect) deliberately malignant, mutilator played such a trick as in\r\nabstracting four leaves from the MS. between caps. xxx. and xxxi. Here\r\nLonginus has begun to speak of diction generally; here he has made that\r\nadmirable descant on “beautiful words” which, though almost all the book\r\ndeserves to be written in letters of gold, would tempt one to indulge\r\nhere in precious stones, so as to mimic, in jacinth and sapphire and\r\nchrysoprase, the effect which it celebrates. When we are permitted\r\nanother glimpse we are back in particular criticism, interesting but\r\nless valuable save indirectly, and in criticisms, too, of Cæcilius,\r\ncriticisms which we could do without. No great good can ever come of\r\ninquiries, at least general inquiries, into the permissible number and\r\nthe permissible strength of Metaphors. Once more we may fall back on the\r\nMaster, though perhaps rather in opposition to some of the Master’s\r\ndicta in this very field. “As the intelligent man shall decide” is the\r\ndecision here, and the intelligent man will never decide till the case\r\nis before him. One bad metaphor is too much: twenty good ones are not\r\ntoo many. Nor is “the multitudinous seas incarnadine” an “excess,”\r\nthough no doubt there have been bad critics who thought so.\r\n\r\nLonginus himself, though he had not had the happiness to read _Macbeth_,\r\nwas clearly not far out of agreement with the [Sidenote:\r\n“_Faultlessness._”] concluding sentiment of the last paragraph, and he\r\nmakes this certain by the disquisition on Faultlessness which follows.\r\nAs a general question this is probably, for the present time at any\r\nrate, past argument, not so much because the possibility of a\r\n“faultless” great poem is denied, as because under the leaden rule of\r\nthe best modern criticism—leaden not from dulness but from\r\nadaptability—few things are recognised as “faults” _in se_ and _per se_.\r\nA pun may be a gross fault in one place and a grace beyond the reach of\r\nart in another: an aposiopesis may be either a proof of clumsy\r\ninequality to the situation or a stroke of genius. But the declaration\r\nof Longinus that he is not on the side of Faultlessness[235] is of\r\ninfinitely greater importance than any such declaration from an equally\r\ngreat critic (“Where is he? Show him to me,” as Rabelais would say)\r\ncould possess to-day. The general Greek theory undoubtedly did make for\r\nexcessive severity to faultfulness, just as our general theory makes\r\nperhaps for undue leniency to it. That Longinus could withstand this\r\ntendency—could point out the faults of the faultless—was a very great\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nFootnote 235:\r\n\r\n  ἐγὼ δ' οἶδα μὲν ὡς αἱ ὑπερμεγέθεις φύσεις ἥκιστα καθαραί.\r\n\r\nAs always, too, his individual remarks frequently give us, not merely\r\nthe satisfaction of agreement, but that of piquant difference or\r\ncuriosity. We may agree with him about Bacchylides and Pindar—though, by\r\nthe way, the man who had the taste and the courage to admire a girl as\r\nχλωραύχενα—as possessing that yellow ivory tint of skin which lights so\r\nmagnificently[236]—was certainly one to dare to challenge convention\r\nwith what its lilies-and-roses standard must have thought a “fault.” But\r\nwe cannot help astonishment at being told that both Pindar and Sophocles\r\n“often have their light quenched without any obvious reason, and stumble\r\nin the most unfortunate manner.”[237] For those of us who are less, as\r\nwell as those who are more, enthusiastic about Sophocles would probably\r\nagree in asking, “Where does he ‘go out in snuff,’ where does he ‘fall\r\nprostrate’ in this fashion?” Surely all the faults cannot be in the lost\r\nplays! We want a rather fuller text of Hyperides than we possess to\r\nenable us quite to appreciate the justice of the comparison of him with\r\nDemosthenes, but that justice is striking even on what we have. On the\r\nother hand, we are rather thrown out by the contrast of Plato and\r\nLysias—it may be owing to the same cause. Even if the comparison were\r\none of style only, we should think it odd to make one between Burke and\r\nBerkeley, though the _Sublime and Beautiful_ would help us a little\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nFootnote 236:\r\n\r\n  Simonides had used the word literally of the nightingale, and there\r\n  are those who hold that Bacchylides merely meant to compliment the\r\n  lady’s _voice_. But let us think more nobly of him.\r\n\r\nFootnote 237:\r\n\r\n  σβέννυνται δε ἀλόγως πολλάκις, καὶ πίπτουσιν ἀτυχέστατα.\r\n\r\nBut all this is a digression,[238] and the author seems to have\r\n[Sidenote: _Hyperboles._] returned to his Metaphors (in a gap where the\r\ndemon has interfered with less malice than usual), and to Hyperboles,\r\nunder the head of which we get a useful touch of contempt for\r\nIsocrates.[239] We are in deeper and more living waters when we come to\r\nthe handling, alas! too brief (though nothing seems here to be lost), of\r\n_ordonnance_, “composition,” selection and arrangement of words. Here is\r\nyet another of those great law-making phrases which are the charter of a\r\nnew criticism. “Harmony is to men not only physically connected with\r\npersuasion and pleasure, but a wonderful instrument of magniloquence and\r\npassion.” It may be difficult for us, with our very slight knowledge (it\r\nwould, perhaps, be wiser to say almost absolute ignorance) of Greek\r\npronunciation, to appreciate his illustrations here in detail. But we\r\ncan appreciate the principle of them exactly, and apply that principle,\r\n[Sidenote: “_Harmony._”] in any language of which we do know the\r\npronunciation, with perfect ease and the completest success. The silly\r\ncritics (they exist at the present day) who pooh-pooh, as niceties and\r\nfiddle-faddle, the order of words, the application of rhythmical tests\r\nto prose, and the like, are answered here beforehand with convincing\r\nforce by a critic whom no one can possibly charge with preferring sound\r\nto sense.\r\n\r\nFootnote 238:\r\n\r\n  I must be allowed to say that it contains one of the most ambitious\r\n  and successful passages of Longinus as an original writer—the\r\n  vindication of Nature’s command to man to admire the magnificent—in\r\n  cap. xxxv. It is a temptation to quote it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 239:\r\n\r\n  οὐκ οἴδ’ ὅπως παιδὸς πρᾶγμα ἔπαθεν διὰ τὴν τοῦ πάντα αὐξητικῶς ἐθέλειν\r\n  λὲγειν φιλοτιμίαν.\r\n\r\nThis refers to prose, but the following chapter carries out the same\r\nprinciple as to poetry with equal acuteness. Longinus, great as his name\r\nis, probably is but little in the hands of those who object (sometimes\r\nalmost with foam at the mouth) to the practice of analysing the mere\r\nharmonic effect of poetry. But it is pleasant to think of these passages\r\nwhen one reads the outcries, nor is the pleasantness rendered less\r\npleasant by the subsequent cautions against that over-rhythmical fashion\r\nof writing which falls to the level of mere dance-music.\r\n\r\nThe caution against over-conciseness and over-prolixity is rather more\r\nof a matter of course, and the strictures on the μικρότης, occasionally\r\nto be found in Herodotus, like some in the earlier parts of the\r\ntreatise, sometimes elude us, as is the case with similar verbal\r\ncriticisms even in languages with which we are colloquially familiar.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the curious Conclusion which, as we have said, is no\r\nconclusion at all, as it would seem, and which yet has [Sidenote: _The\r\nConclusion._] an unmistakable air of “peroration, with [much]\r\ncircumstance,” on the everlasting question, “Why is the Sublime so rare\r\nin our time?” In that day, as in this, we learn (the fact being, as in\r\nKing Charles II.'s fish-experiment, taken for granted), divers\r\nexplanations, chiefly political, were given for the fact. Democracy was\r\na good nurse of greatness: aristocracy was not. But Longinus did not\r\nagree. It was money-getting and money-seeking, pleasure-loving and\r\npleasure-hunting, he thought. Plain living and high thinking must be\r\nreturned to if the Heights were to be once more scaled. A noble\r\nconclusion, if perhaps only a generous fallacy. Had Longinus had our\r\nillegitimate prerogative-_post_rogative of experience, he would have\r\nknown that the blowing of the wind of the spirit admits of no such\r\nexplanations as these. Ages of Liberty and Ages of Servitude, Ages of\r\nLuxury and Ages of Simplicity, Ages of Faith and Ages of Freethought—all\r\ngive us the Sublime if the right man is there: none will give it us if\r\nhe is not. But our critic had not the full premisses before him, and we\r\ncould not expect the adequate conclusion.\r\n\r\nYet how great a book have we here! Of the partly otiose disputes about\r\nits date and origin and authorship one or two things are worth\r\nrecalling, though for other purposes than those of the disputants. Let\r\nit be remembered that it is not quoted, or even referred to, by a single\r\nwriter of antiquity.[240] There is absolutely no evidence for it, except\r\nits own internal character, before the date of its oldest manuscript,\r\nwhich is assigned to the tenth century. Even if, assuming it to be the\r\nwork of Longinus, we suppose it to have been part of one of the works\r\nwhich _are_ ascribed to him (a possible assumption, see note), there is\r\nstill the absence of quotation, still the absence even of reference to\r\nviews so clearly formulated, so eloquently enforced, and in some ways so\r\nremarkably different from those of the usual Greek and Roman\r\nrhetorician. That the book can be of very late date—much later, that is\r\nto say, than that of Longinus himself—is almost impossible. One of its\r\nfeatures, the lack of any reference to even a single writer later than\r\nthe first century, has indeed been relied upon to prove that it is not\r\nlater itself than that date. This is inconclusive for that purpose. But\r\nit makes every succeeding century less and less probable, while the\r\nstyle, though in some respects peculiar, is not in the least Byzantine.\r\n\r\nFootnote 240:\r\n\r\n  “John of Sicily” (Walz, vi. 225), who in the thirteenth century cites\r\n  the lost φιλόλογοι ὁμιλίαι almost as if he was citing the Περὶ Ὕψους,\r\n  is certainly no exception. The undated Byzantine (Cramer, _Anecd.\r\n  Oxon._, iii. 159, quoted by Professor Roberts after Usener), who\r\n  couples Λογγίνου κρίσεις with those of Dionysius, may come nearer, as\r\n  may the anonymous scholiast on Hermogenes (Walz, vii. 963), who cites\r\n  the ὁμιλίαι on τὸ στομφῶδες, “mouthing.”\r\n\r\nThis detachment from any particular age—nay, more, this _vita fallens_,\r\nthis unrecognised existence of a book so remarkable—stands in no merely\r\nfanciful relation to the characteristics of the book itself. It abides\r\nalone in thought as well as in history. That it is a genuine, if a late,\r\nproduction of the classical or semi-classical age we cannot reasonably\r\ndoubt, for a multitude of reasons, small in themselves but strong in a\r\nbundle,—its style, its diction, its limitations of material, and even\r\noccasionally of literary view, its standards, all sorts of little\r\ntouches like the remark about Cicero, and so forth. Yet it has, in the\r\nmost important points, almost more difference from than resemblance to\r\nthe views of classical critics generally. The much greater antiquity of\r\nAristotle may be thought to make comparison with him infructuous, if not\r\nunfair. But we have seen already how far Longinus is from Dionysius, how\r\nmuch further from Plutarch; and we shall see in the next Book how far he\r\nis from Quintilian. Let us look where we will, to critics by profession\r\nor to critics by chance, to the Alexandrians as far as we know them, to\r\nthe professional writers on Rhetoric, to Aristophanes earlier and Lucian\r\nlater, always we see Longinus apart—among them by dispensation and time,\r\nbut not of them by tone, by tendency, by temper.\r\n\r\nFor though he himself was almost certainly unconscious of it, and might\r\neven have denied the fact with some warmth if it had [Sidenote:\r\n_Modernity of the treatise,_]. been put to him, Longinus has marked out\r\ngrounds of criticism very far from those of the ancient period\r\ngenerally, further still from those which were occupied by any critic\r\n(except Dante) of the Middle Ages and the Classical revival, and close\r\nto, if not in all cases overlapping the territory of, the modern\r\nRomantic criticism itself. As we have seen, the ancient critic was wont\r\neither to neglect the effect of a work of art altogether, and to judge\r\nit by its supposed agreement with certain antecedent requirements, or\r\nelse, if effects were considered at all, to consider them from the\r\nmerely practical point of view, as in the supposed persuasive effect of\r\nRhetoric, or from the ethical, as in the purging, the elevating, and so\r\nforth, assigned to Tragedy, and to Poetry generally. Longinus has\r\nchanged all this. It is the enjoyment, the transport, the carrying away\r\nof the reader or auditor, that, whether expressedly or not, is always at\r\nbottom the chief consideration with him. He has not lowered the ethical\r\nstandard one jot, but he has silently refused to give it precedence of\r\nthe æsthetic; he is in no way for lawlessness, but he makes it clear,\r\nagain and again, that mere compliance with law, mere fulfilment of the\r\nrequirements of the stop-watch and the hundredth-of-an-inch rule, will\r\nnot suffice. Aristotle had been forced, equally by his system and his\r\nsense, to admit that pleasure was an end—perhaps the end—of art; but he\r\nblenches and swerves from the consequences. Longinus faces them and\r\nfollows them out.\r\n\r\nIn his attention to rhythm, especially of prose, Longinus is much less\r\nunique, for this point (as we have seen and shall see) was never\r\nneglected by the best ancient critics. But there is again something\r\nparticularly distinguishing in his attempt to trace the sources of the\r\nliterary pleasure in specimen passages. The ancient tendency is, though\r\nnot universally, yet too generally, the other way, to select specimen\r\npassages merely as illustrations of general rules.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings us to his greatest claim of all—that is to say, his\r\nattitude towards his subject as a whole. Although he nowhere [Sidenote:\r\n_or rather sempiternity._] says as much in so many words, no one can\r\nread his book with attention—above all, no one can read it again and\r\nagain critically—without seeing that to him literature was not a\r\nschedule of forms, departments, kinds, with candidates presenting\r\nthemselves for the critic to admit them to one or the other, on and\r\nduring their good behaviour; but a body of matter to be examined\r\naccording to its fruits, according to its provision of the literary\r\npleasure. When it has been examined it is still for the critic to\r\nexplain and justify (according to those unwritten laws which govern him)\r\nhis decision that this was good, this not so good, this bad,—to point\r\nout the reasons of success and failure, to arrange the symptoms,\r\nclassify the methods, and so forth. Where Longinus fell short it was\r\nalmost always because ancient literature had not provided him with\r\nenough material of certain kinds, not because he ruled these kinds out\r\n_a priori_. Longinus was no Rymer. We could submit even Shakespeare to\r\nhim with very little fear, and be perfectly certain that he would not,\r\nwith Rapin, pronounce Dantes Aligerus wanting in fire.[241] Nay, with a\r\nsufficient body of material to set before him, we could trust him with\r\nvery much more dangerous cases than Shakespeare and Dantes Aligerus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 241:\r\n\r\n  Sir Thomas Pope Blount, _Characters and Censures of the most\r\n  Considerable Poets_. London, 1694. P. 58. “Rapin tells us that Dantes\r\n  Aligerus wants fire, and that he has not heat enough.”\r\n\r\nYet, as we have said, he stands alone. We must skip fifteen hundred\r\nyears and come to Coleridge before we meet any critic entirely of his\r\nclass, yet free from some of his limitations. The hand of the author of\r\nthe Περὶ Ὕψους is not subdued, but raised to what he deals in. And his\r\nwork remains towering among all other work of the class, the work of a\r\ncritic at once Promethean and Epimethean in his kind, learning by the\r\nmistakes of all that had gone before, and presaging, with instinctive\r\ngenius, much that was not to come for centuries after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                          BYZANTINE CRITICISM.\r\n\r\nPHOTIUS—DETAILED EXAMINATION OF THE ‘BIBLIOTHECA’—IMPORTANCE OF ITS\r\n    POSITION AS A BODY OF CRITICAL JUDGMENTS—TZETZES—JOHN THE SICELIOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the word Byzantine is not quite such a byword as it once was, it\r\nstill has for the most part an uncomplimentary connotation. How far that\r\nconnotation is justified in reference to our special subject can hardly\r\nbe better set forth than by exposition of three books of the middle and\r\nlater Byzantine period.[242] The first shall be the remarkable and in a\r\nway famous _Bibliotheca_[243] of Photius in the ninth century; the\r\nsecond, the _Homeric Allegories_ of Tzetzes in the twelfth; the third,\r\nthat commentary on the περὶ ἰδέων of Hermogenes by John the Siceliote in\r\nthe thirteenth, which preserves to us our earliest reference to what is\r\nalmost certainly the Περὶ Ὕψους, and assigns it to Longinus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 242:\r\n\r\n  Of course many, perhaps most, of the commentators and scholiasts\r\n  referred to in chaps. iv. and v. are Byzantine in date.\r\n\r\nFootnote 243:\r\n\r\n  Ed. Bekker. Berlin, 1824. 2 vols. 4to, but paged continuously.\r\n\r\nThe first is in its way unique. The author, it may be barely necessary\r\nto say, was Patriarch of Constantinople for a period [Sidenote:\r\n_Photius._] of nearly thirty years, though with an interval of ten,\r\nduring which he was deposed or deprived (858-867, 877-886), in the\r\nlatter half of the ninth century. He was originally a lay statesman,\r\nand, from causes no doubt political as well as religious, was much\r\nengaged in the disputes which led to the final separation between the\r\nEastern and Western Churches. His birth- and death-dates are not known;\r\nbut he was, in the year last mentioned—886—banished by Leo VI. to a\r\nmonastery in Armenia. The _Bibliotheca_ purports to be an account or\r\nreview of books read during an embassy to Assyria, written for the\r\nbenefit, and at the request, of the author’s brother Tarasius. There is\r\nno reason for questioning the excellent Patriarch’s veracity; but if he\r\nactually took with him the two hundred and eighty authors (some of them\r\nvery voluminous) whom he summarises, he must have had one of the largest\r\ntravelling libraries on record. The form is encyclopædic, each author\r\nhaving a separate article beginning Ἀνεγνώθη, “there was read:” and to a\r\ngreat extent these articles consist of summaries of the matter of the\r\nbooks. This, as it happens, is fortunate. Photius seems to have had a\r\nspecial fancy for giving _précis_ of narrative, whether ostensibly\r\nhistorical or avowedly fictitious; and he has thus preserved for us all\r\nor almost all that we know of things so interesting as the _Persica_ of\r\nCtesias, and the _Babylonica_ or _Sinonis and Rhodanes_ of the romancer\r\nIamblichus. Naturally enough, a good deal of his matter is theological,\r\nand his abstracts here are seasoned with a sometimes piquant, but seldom\r\nstrictly critical, animus. But he by no means confines himself to mere\r\nsummary, and we have in his book what we have nowhere else—a sort of\r\ncritical review of a very large portion of Greek literature. Pretty full\r\nabstract after his own manner, and some extract of this, will be the\r\nbest basis possible for considering the state of literary study and\r\ntaste at what was perhaps the only cultivated capital of Europe, if not\r\n(putting the dimmer East out of the question) of the world, at the time\r\nwhen the classical languages were almost half a millennium past their\r\nreal flourishing time, and when as yet only Anglo-Saxon to certainty,\r\nand some other Teutonic dialects probably, had arisen to represent the\r\nnew vernaculars in any kind of literary performance.\r\n\r\nPhotius observes no order in his notices, which would appear to be\r\ngenuine notes of reading; and most of his earliest entries are short,\r\nand devoted to writers possessing at best interest of matter. The first\r\nthat has struck me as possessing the interest of literature is Art. 26,\r\non Synesius. The characterisation of the good Bishop of Ptolemaïs runs\r\nthus: “As for phrase, he [Sidenote: _Detailed examination of the_\r\nBibliotheca.] is lofty and has ὄγκος” (the word we encounter so often\r\nand find so hard to translate), “but swerves off to the over-poetical.”\r\n“His miscellaneous epistles” (the judgment just quoted is on his\r\nphilosophical treatises on Providence, on Monarchy, &c.) “drip with\r\ngrace and pleasure,[244] not without strength and substance[245] of\r\nthought.” The rest is personal and religious, but extremely interesting.\r\n\r\nFootnote 244:\r\n\r\n  χάριτος καὶ ἡδονῆς ἀποστάζουσαι.\r\n\r\nArt. 44 deals with Philostratus and his famous life of Apollonius of\r\nTyana. The bulk of the notice, as we should expect, both from the\r\nPatriarch’s fancy for analysis of narrative and from his religious bent,\r\nis busied with the matter; but we have some actual criticism. He is as\r\nto his phrase “clear, graceful, and aphoristic, and teeming with\r\nsweetness;[246] bent on obtaining honour by archaism and the\r\nfashionableness [or new-fangledness] of his constructions.”[247]\r\nJosephus has Art. 47. He is “clean in phrasing, and clever at setting\r\nforth the intention of his speech distinctly and pleasantly; persuasive\r\nand agreeable in his speeches even if occasion compels him to speak in\r\ndifferent senses; fertile in enthymemes on either side, and with gnomæ\r\nat command if ever any man had them; also most competent to infuse\r\npassions into his discourse, and a proved hand at awaking compassion and\r\nsoftening the reader.” All which (observe the strict rhetorical form of\r\nit) is very handsome towards that Ebrew Jew. The note (49) on Cyril of\r\nAlexandria, that he “keeps the character and idiom of the appropriate\r\nspeech,” that “his style is fashioned and, as it were, forced to express\r\nidiosyncratic idea,”[248] and “is like loose poetry that disdains\r\nmetre,” is itself thoroughly idiosyncratic, and speaks Cyril very well.\r\nTwo others, 55 and 75, of a somewhat acrid character, on Johannes\r\nPhiloponus (“Matæoponus rather,” quoth our Patriarch), are, though\r\nacrid, by no means uncritical. All these are late and mainly\r\necclesiastical writers, though of a certain general literary interest.\r\nThe first author, at once of considerable age and of purely literary\r\nvalue, to be very fully handled is the above-mentioned Ctesias, and we\r\nhave only fragments whereby to control Photius’s criticism of him. But\r\nthe paragraph which comes at the end of the abstract of the _Persica_,\r\nand applies both to that and to the _Indica_, is itself worth\r\nabstracting. “This historian is very clear and simple in language, so\r\nthat his style is mixed with much pleasure. He uses the Ionic dialect,\r\nnot throughout, like Herodotus, but partially. Nor does he, like that\r\nwriter, divert his story to unseasonable digressions. But from the\r\nmythical matters with which Herodotus is reproached neither does Ctesias\r\nabstain, especially in the book called _Indica_. Still, the pleasure of\r\nhis history consists chiefly in the arrangement of his narrative, which\r\nis strong in the pathetic and unexpected, and in the variation of it by\r\ndint of the mythical. His style is slipshod more than is fitting, often\r\nfalling into mere vulgarity. But the style of Herodotus, both in this\r\nand other respects of the power and art of the Word, is the canon of the\r\nIonic dialect.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 245:\r\n\r\n  πυκνότης, which some would render “shrewdness.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 246:\r\n\r\n  βρύων γλυκύτητος.\r\n\r\nFootnote 247:\r\n\r\n  τῷ ἀρχαϊσμῷ καὶ ταῖς καινοπρεπεστέραις τῶν συντάξεων εμφιλοτιμουμενος.\r\n\r\nFootnote 248:\r\n\r\n  εἰς ἰδιάζουσαν ἰδέαν ἐκβεβιασμένος.\r\n\r\nAppian’s _Roman History_ and Arrian’s _Parthica_ come in for successive\r\nnotice, but there is nothing about the latter’s literary character till\r\nthe much later and fuller notice of his Alexander-book at 91, where\r\nPhotius, as is specially his wont with historians, gives a full\r\nappreciation. The pupil of Epictetus, he thinks, \"is second to none\r\namong those who have best drawn up histories, for he is both first-rate\r\nat succinct narration, and he never hurts the continuousness of his\r\nhistory by unseasonable divagations and parentheses.[249] He is original\r\n[“new-fangled,” the usual translation of καινοπρεπὴς, has a too\r\nunfavourable twist in it], rather by the arrangement of his words than\r\nby his vocabulary; and he manages this in such a fashion that hardly\r\notherwise could the tale be told more clearly and luminously. He uses a\r\nvivid, euphonious, well-turned style, and has smoothness well mixed with\r\ngrandeur.[250] His neologisms are not directed to mere innovation _à\r\nperte de vue_,[251] but close and emphatic, so as to be real figures of\r\nspeech and not merely change for ordinary words.[252] Wherefore\r\nclearness is his companion, not merely in this respect, but most of all\r\nin the arrangement and order and constitution of his style, which is the\r\nvery craft-secret of clearness. For the use of merely straightforward\r\nperiods is within the power of mere uncultivated persons,[253] and, if\r\nit be maintained without admixture, brings the style down to flatness\r\nand meanness, whereto Arrian, clear as he is, has not approached. And he\r\nmakes use of elliptic figures not in respect of his period but of his\r\ndiction, so as never to become obscure: if any one should attempt to\r\nsupply what is wanting, it would seem to tend towards the superfluous,\r\nand not really to complete the ellipse. The variety of his figures is\r\nalso one of his strongest points—not changing at once from simple usage,\r\nbut forming themselves gently and from the beginning, so as neither to\r\nannoy with satiety nor to worry by overcrowding. In short, if any be set\r\nagainst him in the matter of historical composition, many even of the\r\nold classics[254] would be found his inferiors in _taxis_.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 249:\r\n\r\n  It is odd to find the hatred of the harmless necessary parenthesis,\r\n  the delight of all full minds and quick wits, and the terror of the\r\n  ignorant and slow, formulated so frequently by Photius.\r\n\r\nFootnote 250:\r\n\r\n  τὸ λεῖον ἔχει τῷ μεγέθει συγκιρνάμενον.\r\n\r\nFootnote 251:\r\n\r\n  εἰς τὸ πόῤῥω.\r\n\r\nFootnote 252:\r\n\r\n  ἐναλλαγὴν συνήθους ὀνόματος. This is an acute criticism, and I do not,\r\n  at the time of writing, remember that it had been anticipated.\r\n  Undoubtedly most practitioners of ornate and unusual style do merely\r\n  “give change for ordinary words,” that is to say, they think in these,\r\n  and then just write something less usual in place of them.\r\n\r\nFootnote 253:\r\n\r\n  ἰδιώταις\r\n\r\nFootnote 254:\r\n\r\n  τῶν ἀρχαίων.\r\n\r\nAppian has earlier had less elaborate praise, as being terse and plain\r\nin phrase, as truth-loving as possible, an expounder of strategic\r\nmethods, and very good indeed at raising the depressed spirit of an\r\narmy, or soothing its excitement, and exhibiting passion by means of\r\nspeeches. It is odd enough, after the exaltation of Arrian—a good writer\r\nbut no marvel—to the skies, to come across the following brief and\r\ngrudging estimate, inserted in the shortest of summaries, of a man of\r\nthe highest genius like Herodotus. Photius here, as elsewhere, does\r\njustice to the Halicarnassian as a canon of Ionic. “But he employs all\r\nmanner of old wives' fables and divagations, whereby an intellectual\r\nsweetness runs through him,[255] though these things sometimes obscure\r\nthe comprehension of the history and efface its proper and corresponding\r\ntype, since truth will not have her clearness clouded by myths, nor\r\nadmit divagations (_parecbaseis_) further than is fitting.” This is\r\nrather dispiriting for the first really great writer whom we meet; and\r\nthe long judgment upon Æschines, which follows shortly, makes little\r\namends, because the orators had been criticised and characterised _ad\r\nnauseam_ for a thousand years. Later we have no ill criticism of Dion\r\nCassius—indeed Photius seems more at ease with post-Christian writers,\r\neven if they be non-Christians, than with the classics proper, or\r\nἀρχαῖοι as he calls them. The careful and somewhat artificial style of\r\nthis historian, his imitation of Thucydides, and some other things, are\r\nwell but briefly noted.\r\n\r\nFootnote 255:\r\n\r\n  δι’ ὧν αὐτῷ ἡ κατὰ διάνοιαν γλυκύτης διαῤῥει. The translation in the\r\n  text, which may be varied as \"which gives him [or \"is the source of\"]\r\n  his pervading intellectual charm,\" and which Professor Butcher\r\n  approves, seems to suit the immediate context best. But διαῤῥέω very\r\n  frequently means “run _off_” or “_away_,” and the general attitude of\r\n  disapproval which Photius assumes towards the Herodotean fabling might\r\n  seem to warrant “whereby his attraction for the intellect disappears.”\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the good Patriarch was no sparing or infrequent\r\nnovel-reader, for, as has been said, he is copious both on some novels\r\nthat we have and on one that we have not. The somewhat monotonous form,\r\nhowever, of the Lower Greek Romance gives him more room for analysis of\r\nstory than for criticism of art. He justly extols the propriety of\r\nHeliodorus, is properly shocked by the looseness of Achilles Tatius, and\r\nputs the lost Iamblichus between them in this respect. His criticism of\r\nthe _Æthiopica_—of many million novel reviews the interesting first—may\r\nbe given, apart, of course, from the argument of the book, which, as is\r\nusual with him, and not uncommon with his followers to-day, forms the\r\nbulk of the article.\r\n\r\n“The book (_syntagma_) is of the dramatic kind [this is noteworthy], and\r\nit uses a style suitable to the plan, for it abounds in simplicity and\r\nsweetness, and in pathetic situations actual or expected. The narrative\r\nis diversified and unexpected, and has strange chance salvations[256]\r\nand bright and pure diction. If, as is reasonable, it sometimes indulges\r\nin tropes, they, too, are brilliant, and exhibit the matter in hand. The\r\nperiods are symmetrical and, on the whole, arranged with a view to\r\nsuccinctness. The plot and the rest are correspondent to the style. His\r\nyarn[257] is of the love of a man and a woman, and he shows an anxious\r\nand careful observance of propriety of sentiment.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 256:\r\n\r\n  σωτηρίαις, a capital phrase for the “rescue or two [and twenty],” the\r\n  “hairbreadth 'scapes” of the Romance.\r\n\r\nFootnote 257:\r\n\r\n  This is irresistible for ὑφαίνει.\r\n\r\nIn Art. 77, on the not very interesting subject of Eunapius, we have the\r\nfamiliar phrase “New Edition” in its literal Greek form.[258] A fresh\r\nexample of the interest he takes in history appears under the head of\r\nDionysius of Halicarnassus, and in Art. 90 Libanius supplies him with\r\noccasion for criticising a rhetorician pure and simple. He is, he\r\nthinks, exhibited to the best advantage[259] in his “plasmatic”\r\n[speeches written on imaginary topics] and gymnastic discourses rather\r\nthan in his others, for by his excessive elaboration and\r\nbusybodyness[260] in these others he has hurt the grace and charm of\r\nthe,[261] as one may say, naïf and impromptu style, and deprived it of\r\nverisimilitude, causing frequent obscurity by insertions, and sometimes\r\neven by abstraction of the necessary. “But in other respects he is a\r\ncanon and standard of Attic speech.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 258:\r\n\r\n  νέα ἐκδόσις.\r\n\r\nFootnote 259:\r\n\r\n  αὐτὸς ἑαυτοῦ χρησιμώτερός εστιν.\r\n\r\nFootnote 260:\r\n\r\n  περιεργία.\r\n\r\nFootnote 261:\r\n\r\n  τήν ἔμφυτον τοῦ λόγου καὶ αὐτοσχέδιον (ὡς ἄν τις εἴποι.)\r\n\r\nLucian and the mysterious Lucius of Patræ seem to have occupied him\r\ntogether, and he discusses the authorship of the _Ass_ with some acumen,\r\nrecognising in Lucian a merely satiric intention, in Lucius a serious\r\nbelief in magic and marvels. As for Lucian himself (respecting whom he\r\nhas preserved for us the great epigram quoted above), he acknowledges\r\nthe universality of the Samosatan’s satire of all things Greek, their\r\ngod-making and their _Aselgeia_, the extravagances of their poets and\r\ntheir political mistakes, the emptiness and pretentiousness of their\r\nphilosophy. In fact, says Photius, in an approach at least to the true\r\nHigher Criticism, “his whole pains are spent on producing a prose Comedy\r\nof Greek things. He himself seems to be one of those who worship nothing\r\nseriously; he scoffs and mocks at other’s doxies, but lays down no creed\r\nof his own, unless one should say that it is a creed to be creedless. In\r\nstyle he is of the very best, brilliant and classical, and signally\r\ndistinguished in diction, and of all others a lover of good order and\r\npurity, with a clear and symmetrical magnificence. His composition is\r\narranged so that the reader seems not to be reading prose, and as though\r\na very pleasant song, without distinct musical accompaniment, were\r\ndropping into the ears of the hearers. And altogether, as we said, his\r\nstyle is of the very best, and ill-matched with the subjects at which he\r\nchose to laugh.”\r\n\r\nPhotius is not lavish of the word _aristos_, and it is only fair to say\r\nthat, for its day and way, this criticism is not far itself from\r\ndeserving the epithet.\r\n\r\nAfter some shorter notices, including a good many of Lexicons (Photius\r\nhimself, it need hardly be said, was a lexicographer), we come, at Art.\r\n159, to Isocrates, on whom the Byzantine judgment is again noteworthy.\r\nHe has more, Photius thinks, of the sophist than, like the other Nine,\r\nof the actual advocate. “His readers can see at once that he employs a\r\ndistinct and pure style, and shows a great deal of care about the\r\ncraftsmanship of his speeches, so that his order and his care overreach\r\nthemselves a little and become excessive. In fact, this excess of\r\napparatus does not so much provide genuine arguments as tasteless\r\nineptitude.”[262]\r\n\r\nFootnote 262:\r\n\r\n  τὸ ἀπειρόκαλον, one of the most damaging of Greek critical terms.\r\n\r\n“Again, he is wanting in ethical character and truth and nervousness of\r\nstyle (γοργότης.) Of sublimity, so far as it suits political discourses,\r\nhe mixes a very good dose, and suitably to his clearness. But his style\r\nis more languid[263] than it ought to be. And he is not least blamed for\r\nattention to trifles, and a balancing of clauses[264] which disgusts.\r\nBut we say this in reference to the excellence of his speeches, pointing\r\nout what fails, and is exceptional in them, inasmuch as in comparison\r\nwith some of those who have made bold to write speeches, even his\r\nshortcomings would appear to be excellence.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 263:\r\n\r\n  ἄτονος.\r\n\r\nFootnote 264:\r\n\r\n  σμικρολογία καὶ τὸ προσκορὲς τιον παρισώσεων. It is needless to say\r\n  that this προσκορὲς, this “satiated nausea” of the balanced antithetic\r\n  sentence, has recurred as regularly as the resort to the most obvious,\r\n  and, so long as it is fresh, most effective, of rhetorical devices.\r\n\r\nImmediately before this article on Isocrates there is a very shrewd note\r\n(and one which is “for thoughts” to any one who has ever written books)\r\non the _Sophistike Paraskeue_ of Phrynichus. “This writer, if any ever\r\nwas, is fullest of various knowledge, but otherwise redundant and\r\ngarrulous: _for when it was open to him to have got the matter\r\ncompletely finished off, without missing a single important point, in\r\nnot a fifth part of his actual length, he, by saying things out of\r\nseason, has stretched it out to an unmanageable bulk; and while he has\r\ncollected for others' use the matter of a good and suitable treatise, he\r\ncannot be said to have made much use of it himself_.”\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to extend these excerpts and abstracts very\r\nconsiderably from my notes of reading the great mass of the\r\n_Bibliotheca_; though the larger part of that mass is itself made up,\r\nnot of literary criticisms at all, but, as has been said, of summaries,\r\nabstracts, and extracts. In not a few cases the longest articles deal\r\nwith commentaries or anthologies, the Platonic studies of the\r\nrhetorician Aristides, the _meletæ_ or declamations of Himerius, the\r\n_Bibliotheca_ of Diodorus, the fortunately still extant\r\nCommonplace-books of Stobæus, and the like. But the foregoing pages have\r\nprobably given sufficient foundation for a study of the Photian\r\nposition, which may be taken, without rashness, as a very favourable\r\nrepresentative of Byzantine criticism generally.[265]\r\n\r\nFootnote 265:\r\n\r\n  And it cannot be too often repeated that when Byzantine men of letters\r\n  were not criticising they were often doing something better _for us_.\r\n  He would be a sorry critic himself who would not give a wilderness of\r\n  all but the very greatest members of his own class for John Stobæus or\r\n  Constantine Cephalas.\r\n\r\nIn making this estimate we must first of all take note of [Sidenote:\r\n_Importance of its position as a body of critical judgment._] certain\r\nlimitations, which may be accidental but which also may not. It is at\r\nleast curious that he never deals directly with a poet. Even his\r\nindirect references, borrowed from his authors, to the greater Greek\r\nverse-writers are few, and, speaking with the reserves due in the case\r\nof so voluminous and peculiar a compilation as the _Bibliotheca_, I do\r\nnot remember any independent poetical criticism of his. On the other\r\nhand, such criticisms as those which have been quoted above on Lucian,\r\non Isocrates, on Phrynichus, and others, show, in the first place, no\r\ncontemptible critical acumen, and in the second place, a critical\r\nattitude which is worthy of a good deal of attention. For the literary\r\ncharacteristics of his authors Photius distinctly “has a good eye”: he\r\ncan see a church by daylight and a little more also. We may even say\r\nthat he shows a good deal more detachment, more faculty of seeing his\r\nman in the round, than any purely classical critic displays. Here and\r\nthere, as in his eulogy of Arrian, he is a little too technically\r\nrhetorical, and has evidently not got rid of the notion of the Figures\r\nas things possessing a real existence. And there is more than a trace in\r\nhim of the growth of that critical jargon which has been noticed above,\r\ncertain phrases recurring rather too often, like “gusto” with\r\nold-fashioned critics, and divers terms, which it is not necessary to\r\nmention, with new-fangled ones. But technicalities are, at their worst,\r\nan evidence that the _techne_ exists. Further, it would be, as has been\r\nseen, extremely unjust to regard Photius as a mere phrase-monger. His\r\ncriticism of Lucian is as comprehensive as it is shrewd, it is\r\n“criticism of life” as well as criticism of literature; that of\r\nIsocrates shows that he was not to be caught by mere scholastic\r\nelegance; that of Phrynichus, that he had an eye for method; his notices\r\nof the Romancers, that he could appreciate and relish kinds out of the\r\nbeaten track of classical literary classification and practice; the\r\nremark on “merely straightforward periods” is a just and shrewd one. Not\r\nonly would Photius have made an exceedingly good reviewer, but we may\r\nsay that he is almost the patriarch of reviewers in two senses, that he\r\nis the first of all such as have dealt practically with literature from\r\nthe reviewer’s point of view.\r\n\r\nTo say this is of course not to give unmitigated and indisputable\r\npraise. There is no lack of advocates of the devil who will say that the\r\nreviewer’s point of view is not easily found in a very original age, or\r\nby a very original genius. It may be so—the age of Photius himself was\r\ncertainly not a very original age, except in countries where the point\r\nof view of the reviewer was as certainly quite unknown. But this is not\r\nthe question for us; the question for us is, Have we met this attitude?\r\nHave we come upon any one occupying this point of view before? And the\r\nanswer must, I think, be, “No; we have not.” Dionysius, of all our\r\nwriters, comes nearest to it, for Quintilian is too summary, and\r\nLonginus is considering rather a single quality of literature, as shown\r\nin divers authors, than divers authors by themselves, and as presenting\r\na combination of qualities in each case. What we would give almost\r\nanything for is a collection of such reviews by Aristotle; and we have\r\nnot got them. We do not know that Aristotle ever thought of such a\r\nthing,[266] though he might well have made it as a preparation for the\r\n_Rhetoric_ and the _Poetics_, just as he made his collection of\r\n“polities” as a preparation for the _Politics_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 266:\r\n\r\n  Unless, which one would rather not think, he meant the _Problems_ (_v.\r\n  supra_ p. 49 _sq._) as such.\r\n\r\nThe absence of poetical criticism from Photius is specially to be\r\nregretted, because it leaves us in doubt as to his power of recognising\r\nand analysing, not merely the finer subtleties of form, but the more\r\ncomplex and interesting kinds of literary matter. His own interests, it\r\nis pretty clear, were, though he had the liking for novels which is\r\noften found in men of science and business, chiefly scientific,\r\nhistorical, and philosophical, including, of course, religion in\r\nphilosophy. There is probably no Greek writer, whose subject in any way\r\nadmitted of it, who has said so little about Homer. In dealing with\r\nStobæus he has the patience (though, as has been seen, he is far from\r\nbeing a mere enumerator) to enumerate all the heads of the _Florilegium_\r\nand the _Eclogæ_, and all the authors, hundreds of them as there are,\r\nwhom the anthologist has laid under contribution. But he is tempted into\r\nno critical asides about them. He is essentially positive—frankly busied\r\nwith matter, or with the more material side of form.\r\n\r\nYet to the historian of criticism he has a singular interest, because of\r\nthat position of origin which has been noted. Cicero and Pliny in their\r\nlibraries were in a position to do much the same thing; had, as we shall\r\nsee, a kind of dim velleity of doing it now and then, but did it not.\r\nAthenæus, if he had cared less for cooks and courtesans, more for\r\nliterature; Aulus Gellius and Macrobius, if mere philology on the one\r\nhand, and mere folk-lore and mythology on the other, had not drawn them\r\naside, would probably have anticipated him. But no one actually has;\r\nnone has applied to the library or its prose division the process which\r\ngoes to the making of a _catalogue raisonné_ in painting. No doubt\r\nPhotius leaves a good deal to be done, independently of his silence on\r\npoetry and drama. His comparison is so limited as to be almost\r\nnon-existent; it is much if he can compare Heliodorus, Iamblichus, and\r\nAchilles Tatius in reference to the treatment of matters erotic; Ctesias\r\nand Herodotus, on the score of resisting, or succumbing to,\r\nstory-telling digression. But even in this there is the germ, the\r\nrudiment, of the great Comparative Method. So again the other great Lamp\r\nof Criticism, the historical estimate, still has its shutter drawn for\r\nhim. A vague distinction between the ἀρχαῖοι and the moderns is indeed\r\nnot uncommon; but we have, so far as I have noticed, no distinct line\r\ndrawn between the two, and both are huddled and jumbled together.\r\nPhotius has not yet risen to that highest conception of criticism which\r\ninvolves the “grasping” of each author in his complete self, and the\r\nplacing of him in the general literary map or genealogy (whichever phase\r\nmay be preferred) of the world. And lastly, the silly old etiquette of\r\nsilence about Latin still seems to weigh, if unconsciously, on him. He\r\ndoes indeed allude to the birth-year of Virgil. In his notices of\r\nhistorians of Rome he necessarily has to mention some Roman matters, and\r\nhe mentions that Cicero was slain while reading the _Medea_. But my\r\nmemory, assisted by Bekker’s excellent index, traces no critical remark,\r\ncomparative or independent, about any great Latin writer, and nothing\r\nmore than the barest mention of one or two by name. Yet, with all these\r\ndrawbacks, the niche we have indicated is securely his, though he has\r\nscarcely yet been established in it.[267]\r\n\r\nFootnote 267:\r\n\r\n  There is in Photius a later notice of Isocrates, in connection with\r\n  others of the usual set of Attic orators; and these are chiefly\r\n  interesting for some references to the literary historian Cæcilius,\r\n  referred to by Longinus, and to Longinus himself as “the critic who\r\n  flourished under Claudius” (predecessor of Aurelian), “and took great\r\n  share in the struggle of Zenobia, queen of the Osrhoeni.” But the\r\n  criticism on Demosthenes referred to can hardly be that of the Περὶ\r\n  Ὕψους.\r\n\r\nIf an example be required between Photius and John, it may be found (of\r\nno encouraging character) in the almost contemptible [Sidenote:\r\n_Tzetzes._] _Homeric Allegories_ of Tzetzes[268] written in that dreary\r\n“political” verse, the only consolation of which is the remembrance\r\nthat, whether as origin or echo, it has sometimes been connected with\r\nthe charming _Meum est propositum_ metre of the Latin Middle Ages. In\r\nTzetzes, the allegorical method neither reaches its pinnacle of\r\nfantasticality as in the _Romance of the Rose_,—there is often something\r\nfaintly fascinating there,—nor attains to the rather imposing mazes and\r\nmeanderings of fifteenth-century personification, but stumbles along in\r\npedestrian gropings of this kind[269] (on _Il._ i. 517 _sq._): “The\r\ngroaning of Zeus signifieth a puff of wind moving the eyebrows of him,\r\nand conducting the thickness of clouds. The downcoming of Thetis\r\nindicates that there was rain, which is also a kind of consentment of\r\nassistance. And the coming of Zeus to his own home is the restoration of\r\nthe atmosphere to its former condition, having thinned out the thickness\r\nof the cloud to rain. The rising up of the gods from their seats is the\r\nconfusion and disturbance of the elements,” &c., &c. The much-ridiculed\r\nallegorical morals of the _Gesta Romanorum_ are sense, poetry, piety, to\r\nthis ineffably dull and childish attempt to substitute a cheap\r\npseudo-scientific Euhemerism for the criticism of literature. If\r\nAllegory had not too profitably assisted at the cradle of Greek\r\nliterature, she certainly infested its death-bed in her most decrepit\r\nand malignant aspect.\r\n\r\nFootnote 268:\r\n\r\n  Ed. Boissonade, Paris, 1851.\r\n\r\nFootnote 269:\r\n\r\n  Ed. cit., p. 81, l. 299 _sq._\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we must not be too contemptuous of Byzantine\r\ncriticism. Had the vast mass of the later rhetorical [Sidenote: _John\r\nthe Siceliote._] scholiasts yielded nothing to the sifting but the\r\nquotation in John the Siceliote (though as from the _Philological\r\nHomilies_, not the Περὶ Ὕψους), by name, of the Longinian censure on the\r\n_Orithyia_, it would almost be justified in existing, not to mention\r\nreferences in others, one of which shows us that in the same collection\r\nLonginus gave a discussion (the tendency of which we can easily guess)\r\non the _stomphodes_ or “mouthy.”[270] But the siftings are not quite\r\nlimited to these two.\r\n\r\nFootnote 270:\r\n\r\n  _V. supra_, p. 171 _note_.\r\n\r\nJohn, who appears possibly, if not at all certainly, to have had the\r\nsurname of Doxopater, and to have been sometimes designated by it,\r\nappears also to have been a monk. He must (on his own authority) have\r\nobserved the virtue of Poverty much better than some of his fellows, and\r\nfew of them can have more avoided the vice of laziness. His voluminous\r\nworks devoted to Rhetoric are ranged by Walz[271] under eleven titles:\r\nto wit, Prolegomena and Homilies on the Progymnasmata of Aphthonius,\r\nGeneral Prolegomena to Rhetoric, Commentaries on the States, Inventions\r\nand Ideas of Hermogenes, Epideictic speeches on the Horse and against\r\nthe Saracens, a destructive discussion of the myth of Prometheus, a\r\n“Basileios” and a “Politikon.” These works contain some personal details\r\nand complaints, which, if he subsequently became Patriarch of\r\nConstantinople, were heard by Fortune in her less savage mood; and he\r\nseems to have busied himself with theology and history, as well as\r\nrhetoric. But it is very difficult to place either his patriarchate, or\r\nconsequently his life, chronologically. He might have been the John\r\nGlycas who held the dignity from 1316 to 1320, when he abdicated; but\r\nGlycas seems to have been married. So perhaps he was John Camater, an\r\nearlier occupant (under the Latin Empire) of the see in 1204.\r\n\r\nFootnote 271:\r\n\r\n  Vol. vi. p. 5 _sq._\r\n\r\nAll this, it will be seen, is a rather unsubstantial pageant; but John’s\r\nworks are solid enough. Even the _Prolegomena_ (taking them as his) of\r\nDoxopater, and the _Commentaries on the Ideas_ (to which alone we have\r\naccess), fill five hundred pages. It is in the latter that we are to\r\nlook for anything touching our subject. They are rather wide-ranging, to\r\nwhich character of theirs we doubtless owe the Longinian citation.\r\n\r\nNeither did John always observe that scrupulous accuracy which is so\r\ndear to the heart of a certain class of critic, that, like a true\r\naltruist, he would have every one, except himself, possess it. At the\r\nopening he writes “Themistocles” for “Miltiades.” But his erudition is\r\nconsiderable, and his qualities in other respects not contemptible. It\r\nis, however, very noticeable that he is as much inclined to the general\r\nand disinclined from the particular as if he had lived fifteen hundred\r\nyears earlier. Although he is no slavish Platonist (he has somewhere the\r\nhappy phrase Πλάτων Πλάτωνος ἀναξίως. “Did Plato? the less Plato he”),\r\nhe is fully Platonic in his scorn of the μερικαὶ ἰδέαι, of the mere\r\n“characterising” speeches, Lysiac and Isocratean, and so forth, and aims\r\nat the “circumprehensive and comprehensive” idea and phrase which\r\ntranscends all these. Thus we are once more face to face with that\r\nputting of the cart before the horse which has met us so often—with that\r\ndiscussion of δεινότης and γλυκύτης which is no doubt a capital thing in\r\nits way, but which ought to be preluded and, as military men say,\r\n“prepared” by a long, by an almost infinite, examination of the\r\nindividual exponents and practitioners of the Vigorous and the Sweet.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, fair to remember that he is annotating Hermogenes, and\r\nthat he can hardly be expected to follow methods different from those of\r\nhis text. But it necessarily follows that his loyalty leads him away\r\nfrom the fields most likely to be fertile for us, and, when he does\r\napproach them, directs him mainly to the Orators, and to them chiefly,\r\nif not wholly, from the strictly rhetorical point of view. Yet he is by\r\nno means ill to read, though a little technical and abstract, on rhythm\r\n(opening of Bk. i. chap. i.); and if he has gone no further in reference\r\nto φαντασία than all before him except Philostratus, that is no great\r\nreproach to him. Undoubtedly, however, his chief—as at the same time his\r\nmost tantalising—attraction is his reference to things which, in his\r\ncomparatively modern period, must have still existed, but which seem now\r\nto be irrecoverably lost. Such is his quotation, p. 93, of certain\r\nremarks of Longinus on the poet Menelaus.[272] We may doubt whether\r\ndefinite poetical criticism from the excellent John would have been\r\nsatisfactory, when we find him assigning “out-and-out”[273] poetical\r\nquality to the soft inanity of Isocrates, and the want of it to the\r\nrough fire of Thucydides. Yet in the lower and “composition-book” kind\r\nof criticism he is not to seek—the synopsis of clearness at p. 173 being\r\na very workmanlike composition.[274]\r\n\r\nFootnote 272:\r\n\r\n  Apparently this poet, “by taking pains, changed an unhappily gifted\r\n  nature into exactness and blamelessness.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 273:\r\n\r\n  ἄντικρυς.\r\n\r\nFootnote 274:\r\n\r\n  Besides citing the _Orithyia_ passage John also refers to Longinus as\r\n  admiring Moses (Walz, vi. 211), which, of course, strengthens the\r\n  supposition that he had the Περὶ Ὕψους before him not a little (_v.\r\n  supra_, pp. 156, 162).\r\n\r\nAnd so, without further minute examination of this curiosity, we may\r\ntake some general view of it as the last words—or fairly representative\r\nof the last words—of Greek rhetorical criticism, unaffected by mediæval\r\nliterature, unaffected even by Latin, to any considerable, or at least\r\navowed, extent, but turning round and round the long-guarded treasures\r\nof its own special hoard, like the dragons of fable. To us, perhaps, the\r\nhoard does not seem very inviting. The enormous apparatus of distinction\r\nand terminology is set to work, almost exclusively, on matter which has\r\nneither the attraction of the highest æsthetic problems, nor the\r\npractical interest and profit of direct literary criticism of\r\nparticulars. There is abundance of learning, and by no means a dearth of\r\nmother-wit. But the worst side of Scholasticism—the side which was long\r\nunjustly taken for the whole, but which _is_ a side thereof—makes itself\r\nalmost universally felt. Sometimes one almost thinks of one of the\r\nkeenest, if not the most generally delectable, strokes of Rabelaisian\r\nsatire, the duel of signs between Panurge and Thaumast. This -_tes_ and\r\nthat -_ia_ hurtle through the air almost without conveying\r\nunderstanding, though they may darken a good deal. With sufficient pains\r\nand goodwill, you may disinter many a shrewd remark, many a really\r\nuseful definition, many a scrap of precious information, by no means\r\nunintelligently used. But on the whole, the impression is as of the\r\nghost of Rhetoric struggling against being re-embodied as the soul of\r\nCriticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            INTERCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have endeavoured, in the foregoing Book, to survey—from the actual\r\ntexts, and admitting no conjectural or theoretical reconstruction—the\r\nhistory of literary criticism in Greece and the Greek Empire till its\r\nfall. It is our duty in this first halt to survey this survey—to see\r\nwhat results it actually gives us, to classify and arrange them, to\r\naccount for them as philosophically as possible, and, without digressing\r\ninto the quicksands of theory, to lay down the solid road of logical and\r\nhistorical perspective.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that criticism in Greece began from two different sources,\r\nneither of which, perhaps, was, or could have been expected to be,\r\nlikely to supply it in an absolutely unmixed condition. There was, in\r\nthe first place, the strong Greek philosophising tendency, working upon\r\nthe earliest documents (the most important, then as now, identified with\r\nthe name of Homer), and subjecting them to processes which oftenest took\r\nthe form of a kind of rationalising allegory. The second was the\r\ninvention, for more or less practical purposes, of the art of Rhetoric\r\nor Persuasive Composition. As, in the first place, the collection of\r\nwritten literature was very small, and as the oratorical character\r\nimpressed itself more or less strongly upon nearly _all_ literature in\r\nthe process of publication, this dominance of Oratory was long\r\nmaintained, and continued, almost to the latest times, to prevent\r\nRhetoric from assuming its proper etymological position as\r\n“speech-craft” in the widest sense, as the art of artificially arranged\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nBut this inconvenience, always more or less existing, was mitigated by\r\npractice in divers ways. As actual literature, both prose and verse,\r\nmustered and multiplied, and as it was more and more enjoyed by the keen\r\nGreek appetite for pleasures of all kinds, it at the same time presented\r\nmore and more temptation to the equally keen Greek aptitude for\r\nphilosophical inquiry. Larger and larger treasuries were made available\r\nfor quotation and imitation; more and more kinds of literature were\r\npresented to the student for investigation, classification, inquiry into\r\nsources, methods, effects. And so after a century, or a century and a\r\nhalf, of progress and exercise, of which little remains to us except the\r\nbrilliant, but from this point of view wayward, work of Plato, we are\r\nconfronted, in the work of Aristotle, with an Art of Poetry, incomplete\r\nin certain ways, but singularly mature in its own way, with an Art of\r\nProse which, though it has not yet by any means recognised its real\r\nnature and estate, and persists in regarding itself as an Art of\r\nPersuasion merely, has yet accumulated many valuable observations, and\r\nhas made the paths of future investigators fairly straight and smooth.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, the oratorical preoccupation prevented Rhetoric from\r\nattaining the development which might otherwise have been expected, both\r\nRhetoric and Poetics were very seriously obstructed by the unequal\r\ngrowth of literary kinds within Greek itself, and by the absence of any\r\nother literature with which to compare such kinds as existed, and by\r\nwhich to discern the absence of those that did not exist. The whole of\r\nGreek Poetic was prejudicially affected—and the affection has continued\r\nto be a source of evil in all criticism since—by the accidental lateness\r\nof prose fiction in Greek literature; just as the whole of Greek\r\nRhetoric was prejudicially affected by the accidental predominance of\r\nGreek oratory. The habit—in the main a sound one—of generalising from\r\nthe actual facts, led to very arbitrary theories of more literary kinds\r\nthan one. It was assumed that what we may call “periodic” Epic was the\r\nonly kind; and Romance, which may be very fairly called a “loose” Epic,\r\nwas barred as improper. Still more was the same distinction ignored in\r\ndrama; where a single, though in its way very perfect, form of Tragedy\r\nwas arbitrarily assumed to be the only one possible or permissible. So\r\nthe accidental and easily separable extravagances and licences of the\r\nAncient Comedy were allowed to obscure its merits, and depress its rank,\r\nin the eyes of the critic. Lyric—perhaps the very highest of all\r\nliterary kinds, as it must be the oldest, and is the most\r\nperennial—became a mere appendage to tragedy. The great kind of History,\r\nin which Greece had already produced such magnificent examples, was in\r\nthe same way regarded as a sort of baggage-waggon to oratorical\r\nRhetoric; and the dialogic form which was preferred in philosophy,\r\npartly owing to the habits of the nation, and partly owing to the\r\ntowering eminence of Plato, was in the same way, or much the same way,\r\nallowed or forced to attach itself to the same train.\r\n\r\nBut these mischiefs, though sufficiently considerable, and assisted by\r\nthe ignorance (changed latterly in the worse days to a contemptuous\r\nignoring) of other languages, were by no means the equals of those\r\ncaused directly by this ignorance, while they were aggravated by it in\r\nevery way. If, while we are certainly not superior to the ancients in\r\nmost branches of literature, where comparison is possible, we may\r\nchallenge them more safely in criticism, it is due almost, if not quite\r\nwholly, to what has been called the illegitimate advantage of our\r\npossession of an infinitely larger stock of accumulated literature, and\r\nof the fact that this literature is distributed over the most various\r\ntimes, nations, and languages. It is the rarest thing at any time to\r\nfind a critic of the first class who is not acquainted with literatures\r\nbesides his own; and it is almost invariable to find that the mistakes\r\nwhich great critics make arise out of ignorance or forgetfulness of\r\nother literatures besides their own. But even in antiquity there is no\r\ncritic of, or approaching, this first class, except Aristotle, who\r\nsuffered the full exposure to this disability. As a “tongue of\r\ncomparison” Longinus knew Latin: Dionysius and Quintilian, who, if not\r\ncritics of the first class, are not far off it, knew, the one Latin, the\r\nother Greek. But Aristotle (unless the legends about Alexander having\r\nsent him Indian communications have any basis, and unless we take the\r\nreferences of Plato and others to Egyptian stories as having much more\r\nsolid ground than there is any reason to accord them) had none, and\r\ncould have had none: while, even if he had been stocked with Egyptian\r\nand Sanscrit, these would have done him but little good, though they\r\nmight have corrected his delusions as to the necessary connection of\r\npoetry and fiction. It must always be reckoned as one of the most fatal\r\nproofs of the literary inferiority of the Roman genius that the younger\r\nliterature, though it enjoyed the bilingual advantage to the full, made\r\nso little advance on the older in criticism.\r\n\r\nFor the three centuries between Aristotle and Dionysius we are but ill\r\nprovided with original texts. But both from what we have, and from such\r\nnotices as are trustworthy, we can be tolerably sure that attention was\r\nalmost entirely devoted, on the one side to the verbal or material\r\ncriticism of the Alexandrian and Pergamene schools, on the other to\r\ntechnical Rhetoric. Now the former, though a most necessary ancilla to\r\nliterary appreciation proper, is always to be kept in proper\r\nsubordination to her mistress; and the conditions of the latter, though\r\nin one sense favourable to criticism (inasmuch as the stock of actual\r\nliterature was always increasing, and the temptation to turn to it from\r\nmere declamation-making might at least be expected to be always\r\nstronger), was in itself becoming more and more a futile technique.\r\nSymbouleutic oratory (above vestry rank) was killed and kept dead by the\r\npetty tyrants, the less successors of Alexander, and lastly the Roman\r\nrule. Judicial Rhetoric tended to confine itself to minor causes. Only\r\nEpideictic, the most dangerous of the kinds, began to flourish more and\r\nmore, and resulted by degrees, as we have seen, in the creation of a\r\nsingular profession or pseudo-profession, the members of which had about\r\nthem something of the travelling lecturer, something of the popular\r\npreacher, something—nay, a good deal—of the hack book-maker, and not a\r\nlittle of the journalist pure and simple. Their own study of literature,\r\nunless they kept to the stock passages of the textbooks, must have been\r\nfairly thorough; but literature was to them partly what Burton’s\r\n_Anatomy_ was to Captain Shandon, a mere dictionary of quotations,\r\npartly a collection of patterns. Very rarely did they take it by itself\r\neven for the canvas of one of their show-orations, and when they did it\r\nwas seldom or never from the point of view of appreciation of strictly\r\nliterary beauty.\r\n\r\nFor about half a century before and a century after the Christian era\r\nthe record, even putting Latin criticism aside altogether, is a more\r\ndistinct one. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Plutarch, and Dion Chrysostom,\r\ngive us a good deal more material than we have yet had. But the results\r\nof the inspection of it are not wholly satisfactory. Dionysius of\r\nHalicarnassus is, as has been said, perhaps our typical specimen of the\r\nliterary critic of antiquity. He has far less force and method and\r\noriginality than Aristotle; but then he is a student confining himself\r\nto Rhetoric and History, not a world-philosopher, taking up the\r\nphilosophy of literature merely as part of a whole. He has far less\r\ngenius than Longinus; but he is also far more copiously preserved. We\r\nread him with respect; we meet just and acute observations in him, we\r\ncan even occasionally compliment him on something like (never quite) the\r\n“grasp” of the comic fragment. But he is still partly under the\r\nlimitations of his technical rhetoric, partly under others less easy to\r\ndescribe exactly; and he neglects Latin literature, by his time a very\r\nconsiderable entity. He cannot wholly bring himself to regard literature\r\nas literature. With Plutarch the case is much worse, for it is evident\r\nthat he will not do this at all. It is an educating and ethical\r\ninfluence; a convenient storehouse of fact and example; a respectable\r\nprofession; but not a great, a sovereign, and an infinitely delightful\r\nart. As for Dion (the most literary of the pure rhetoricians, and a\r\nfavourable example of them), he is only an entertainer, the showman of\r\nanother art, which is not quite coarse, but is certainly not in the\r\nhighest sense fine. Lucian, somewhat later, is a true artist, a true man\r\nof letters, and occasionally a critic, endowed with unerring eyes and\r\nthe very Sword of Sharpness itself, but he is this only at times, and\r\neven at those times he is too negative.\r\n\r\nIf we advance a little in point of time and turn our attention to the\r\nstrict teaching and practice of Rhetoric itself, from the second century\r\nonward, and probably backward almost to the very time of Aristotle, the\r\nspectacle is even less satisfactory. The work, of which Hermogenes and\r\nAphthonius are the coryphæi, leading an innumerable chorus of followers\r\nand commentators, who continue for more than a thousand years, is not\r\nexactly contemptible work. Work conducted with extreme diligence and\r\nalso, at any rate in some cases, with remarkable alertness and acuteness\r\nof mind, can never be wholly contemptible. But it is work disappointing,\r\nunsatisfying, and even irritating to the last degree. The technical\r\nRhetoric, always arbitrarily limited in subject and perversely\r\nconventional in method, has practically lost all chance of exercising\r\nitself in the noblest of its three divisions. Deliberative oratory is\r\ndead, except in exercises and make-believes, and the bread-winning\r\nchicanery of forensic, the frivolities (hollow except as also\r\nbread-winning) of epideictic, have usurped the whole room. It might be\r\nthought that in this bereaved condition the art would bethink itself of\r\nthat profitable, dignified and delightful application which it had\r\nalways more or less directly practised, but which had seemed less\r\ndignified than Persuasion—the art of literary criticism proper. But it\r\ndoes nothing—or but little—of the kind. The remarks of Hermogenes on\r\nFrigidity are not bad; the doubtful Demetrius, in his study of\r\nInterpretation, is not far from the true kingdom others approach it here\r\nand there. The invention of that critical “lingo,” to which reference\r\nhas more than once been made, is something, though a something liable to\r\nabuse, and capable of standing in the way of better things. But, on the\r\nwhole, the endless procession of some fifty generations, from the author\r\nof the _Rhet. ad Alex._ to John of Sicily, busies itself either on the\r\none hand with endless distinctions, systematisations, and terminologies,\r\nwith everlastingly twining strands of new colour into the rope that lets\r\ndown the bucket into the empty well, and varying the staves and hoops of\r\nthe bucket itself; or on the other with the provision of cut-and-dried\r\npatterns for the use of the brainless, with telling tongue-tied sophists\r\nwhat they are to say at the funeral of a fifth cousin, and how to make\r\nthe most of a harbour which is dry for three-quarters of every tide.\r\n\r\nAmidst all this desert and chaos of wasted industry there stands the\r\ngreat rock of the Περὶ Ὕψους with its shade and refreshment in the weary\r\nland of its own contemporaries, and with its brow catching the dawn\r\nwhich was not to shine fully for more than fifteen hundred years, and is\r\nhardly noon-day yet. In the section devoted to it we have examined, as\r\nthoroughly as our limits permitted, the special merits and defects of\r\nthis great little book; it is only necessary here to lay a slight\r\nadditional stress on the fact that if it be not the sole book of\r\nantiquity—the sole book, except Dante’s, of antiquity, the Middle Ages,\r\nthe Renaissance, and the earlier modern times—to set forth that critical\r\nideal which comprehends the formal and the material, the verbal and the\r\nideal merits of literature, it exhibits this comprehension as no other\r\nbook does. To confine ourselves to our present special subject—the\r\ncriticism of Greek antiquity—Plato may alternate noble flights with\r\ncurious crotchets about literature; Aristophanes may criticise from the\r\npoint of view of robust common-sense which is yet not in the least\r\nPhilistine; Aristotle may have almost a mathematical grasp of his own\r\nnotions of form, and a generous enthusiasm for certain kinds of dignity\r\nin subject and proportion; Dionysius may show that adherence to\r\ntechnique (and a rather vicious technique too) is quite compatible with\r\ngenuine literary appreciation. But all these, and much more others, have\r\ntheir eyes mainly off the object. Aristotle himself at times, lesser men\r\nlike Plutarch, who have misread their Plato, continually, seem to think\r\nit rather vain to look at that object at all. The intelligent enjoyment\r\nof literature; the intimacy with it, at once voluptuous and\r\nintellectual; the untiring, though it may be never fully satisfied,\r\nquest after the secret of its charms, never neglecting the opportunity\r\nof basking and revelling in them—these things, till we come to Longinus,\r\nare rare indeed. And when we do meet them, the rencontre is of a sort of\r\naccidental and shamefaced character. When we come to Longinus there is\r\nno more false modesty. “Beautiful words are the light of thought.” These\r\nwords themselves are the lantern of criticism.\r\n\r\nElsewhere it gleams more faintly; though it would be as ungrateful as it\r\nwould be Philistine to ignore the debt which we owe to others, from\r\nAristotle himself downwards. It is characteristic of Greek criticism—and\r\nit is the secret of its weakness as well as of its strength—that it is\r\nmore busy with kinds than with authors, with authors than with books.\r\nAnd when it is busy with authors at all, it is hardly ever busy with\r\nthem as wholes, as phenomena occupying an individual place in the\r\nliterary cosmos; but almost always as examples of this or that quality,\r\nas supplying illustrations of this or that Figure, as giving a good\r\npattern for such-and-such a progymnasma, a model for dealing with\r\nsuch-and-such a stasis. Proceeding in this way, criticism attempts—and\r\nfails—to be scientific; it renounces its right to be artistic, and\r\neffects the renunciation. The individual _ethos_ of the poet, the more\r\nsolid but not less individual _ethos_ of the proseman, flies off and\r\nmelts away, when each is merely regarded as an example of “_todetes_” or\r\n“_tallotes_” as a lecturer’s cabinet, in which you put your hand to draw\r\nout an illustration of Anadiplosis or Palillogia. Almost may the most\r\nidealist of metaphysical students think of turning to sheer Hobbism, of\r\nblaspheming “_nesses_ and _tudes_ and _ties_,” when he sees them dragged\r\nin and abused after this fatal fashion, which even Aristotle does not\r\nwholly escape, and in which others indulge as if it were their sole and\r\nlegitimate business.\r\n\r\nIt follows that, except for the stock contrast of Herodotus and\r\nThucydides, in respect of the Orators (the exception being there due to\r\nan obvious reason), and to a less extent of the Three Tragedians, we\r\nhave very few studies at once comprehensive and comparative of authors\r\nin Greek, and that, out of Longinus, such studies as we have are\r\nscrappy, technical, and altogether lacking in that critical συνάρπασμα\r\nwhich the great _locus_ of Simylus requires. There is really no second\r\npassage in Greek which can be put alongside of the Longinian estimate of\r\nthe _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_, agree or disagree as we may with the\r\ndetails of this.\r\n\r\nAnother and a very important matter (which it is fairer and more\r\nphilosophical to call rather a defect of our understanding than a defect\r\nof the matter presented to it) lies in that impossibility of attaining\r\nthe Greek standpoint as to certain rhythmical and verbal matters, which\r\nhas been more than once glanced at, and which is instanced in the case\r\nof Longinus himself. Few among the wiser even of those who have paid\r\nspecial attention to the subjects of Greek music and Greek pronunciation\r\nwould, I think, assert, that they thoroughly understand the passages\r\nrelating to prose rhythm, and the special suitableness of the cretic and\r\nsome of the pæons as the base-feet for it. And it is practically\r\nadmitted by most sober and well-instructed critics that both Aristotle\r\nand Longinus make strictures upon things as “frigid” and in bad taste,\r\nthat they ostracise metaphors and ban conceits which to any modern\r\ncriticism (putting aside mere assentation) seem perfectly harmless, if\r\nnot positively admirable. The same thing occurs in English and French to\r\nthis day, although in this case all the difficulties which beset us in\r\nrelation to Greek disappear, except the radical difference of national\r\n(not now even of temporal) ear and brain. A phrase of Bossuet, which\r\nseems to French ears even of to-day the _ne plus ultra_ of majestic\r\nmelody, will strike very well-instructed Englishmen as a rhetorical\r\njingle and French critics of enthusiasm and enlightenment will see no\r\ndifference between the music of Moore and that of Shelley, or rather\r\nprefer the former. In the other sphere, what is to an Englishman a piece\r\nof dry humour will appear to a Frenchman a _saugrenu_ monstrosity; and a\r\nFrenchman’s ideal of manly eloquence, dignified or passionate as the\r\ncase may be, will seem to an Englishman to show nothing but the maudlin\r\npathos of a drunkard, or the petulant braggadocio of a child. Yet here\r\nthere are innumerable side-lights, a long course of partially identical\r\nhistory, literature, and religion, the experience of persons of both\r\nnations who have lived in and with the other, to guide us. No wonder\r\nthat, when we have none of these things, we should be puzzled. Yet the\r\nquarrel, such as it is, with the Greek critics, is not so much that\r\ntheir estimates, low or high, differ from ours, as that they have given\r\nus so few documents from their own side to help out the contrast. Even\r\none essay, on both the literatures, by a Greek to set over against the\r\ninvaluable survey by Quintilian would be not merely something for which\r\nwe could gladly exchange most of the Greek writers on Rhetoric, except\r\nAristotle, but something in consideration of which we would gladly read\r\nall these writers, and make no complaint of them. As it is, we have to\r\ngo to Photius, a representative of a time and thought far more alien\r\nfrom those of the Greeks proper than is Quintilian himself, for full\r\nreview of even Greek writers, and he also is silent about Latin.\r\n\r\nBut “something sealed the mouths of these Evangelists.” It is perhaps\r\nnot unphilosophical to think that this silence was the price the world\r\nhad to pay for the confident and magnificent advance which it made under\r\nthe guidance of the Greek genius. If that genius had been less\r\nconfident, if it had assumed less cavalierly that no other literature\r\ncould be worth taking into account, if it had hesitated and faltered\r\nabout systematising boldly whatever had been produced by itself, and\r\nallowing everything else (if anything else existed) to go κατ’ οὖρον,\r\nwhat we have would probably not have been vouchsafed to us. And in that\r\ncase we should, as probably, never have made up the loss. The estimable\r\nbut not wise persons who try to make out that the undoubtedly rich and\r\ngreat languages and literatures of Modern Europe can supply substitutes\r\nfor those of Greece and Rome overlook, ignore, or perhaps are honestly\r\nignorant of, the fact that the very strong points of these modern\r\nlanguages and literatures, their Romantic ebb and flow, their\r\nuncertainty, their complaisance to the vagaries of the individual, their\r\nlack of logical system and _ordonnance_, make it impossible that they\r\nshould ever give us the principles of fixity which we find in the\r\nClassical tongues. Those of us who, far more by chance and good fortune\r\nthan by any deliberate and virtuous _proairesis_, happen to be\r\nacquainted pretty equally with both Ancient and Modern Literature, know\r\nthat neither will do alone, but that for the education both of the world\r\nat large and of any epoch of it, the Ancient is even more necessary than\r\nthe Modern.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the positive extent of our debts to Greek is necessary to\r\nthis history, though a _résumé_ of them is no easy thing to give. In the\r\nfirst place has to be reckoned the laying of the foundations of mere\r\ngrammar—the preliminary to every kind of _graphica lexis_. This must\r\nhave been done pretty early, and there is no language in the literary\r\nrecord with which it could be done for the first time to so much\r\nadvantage as with Greek. Some languages, as Latin and its daughter\r\nFrench, have a sort of peddling tendency to purely arbitrary rule, and\r\nto enforced observance of it. Others, the chief example of which is\r\nEnglish, have had too haphazard a history, and are too much of ingrained\r\nrebels to strict convention, to admit of elaborate grammar, despite the\r\nathletic attempts which are sometimes made to discover it in them.\r\nBetween these two, Greek presents not so much the happy mean as the\r\nconsummate union of all the best qualities. It evidently possessed, from\r\nthe remotest time at which we have any traces of literature, an innate\r\nsense of proportion and grammatical symmetry to guide it, first into\r\nunconscious and then into conscious symmetry of accidence and syntax,\r\nbesides a native melody at once sweet, vigorous, and disciplined, which\r\nmade it the ideal raw material for prosody. On the other hand, the\r\nintense philosophical spirit of the Greeks, and their love of liberty,\r\nsaved them from the hard and fast irrationality of the grammars of some\r\nlanguages, and from the tendency, not merely to make arbitrary rules,\r\nbut to insist on their observance with absolute rigidity. The result was\r\na grammar which to this day is the pattern grammar of the world—as\r\nflexible as it is symmetrical, as intelligently free as it is\r\nphilosophically policed,—an eternal harmony of idiom and rule.\r\n\r\nWe have glanced in the above paragraph at Prosody, but something more\r\nmust be said on this head, for the debt of literary criticism to Greek\r\nin this respect is almost the mightiest item of the total account. The\r\nmathematical element, which distinguishes this part of Grammar, enables\r\na people with a suitable language, and a sufficient stock of experiments\r\nin it, to discover something much more like a universal calculus than is\r\npossible in Accidence and Syntax; and the Greeks discovered this.\r\nProsody is a science which, in its pure, though of course not in its\r\napplied, divisions, as regards strictly metrical writing, they\r\npractically found out once for all.\r\n\r\nThere are systems of rhythm—early Latin probably, early Teutonic\r\ncertainly—to which this prosody does not apply, except partially, if it\r\napplies at all. But all poetries that depend upon _metre_—that is to\r\nsay, on the arrangement of equivalenced syllabic values in certain\r\nrecurring orders—are governed by the laws which the Greeks discovered,\r\nand which the Greeks exemplified. On this side, therefore (and it is a\r\nmost important side), the literary critic owes them everything. They\r\nhave furnished him with every tool that he requires for taking to pieces\r\nthe mechanism of the _Ancient Mariner_, as well as of the choruses, of\r\nthe _Agamemnon_, of the odes of Hugo as well as of those of Pindar, of\r\nthe _Nordsee_ of Heine as of the fragments of Sappho and Alcæus. And it\r\nis not at all improbable that if we possessed more of their work on\r\nprose rhythm, that subject also, and the kindred one of the so-called\r\naccentual rhythms of Latin and early Teutonic verse, would be almost as\r\nmuch facilitated.\r\n\r\nWhen we pass beyond these elements and come to the general subject of\r\nRhetoric (which, it must be remembered, in at least some places is\r\nrecognised as covering the whole of _graphica lexis_) and Poetics, the\r\nadvances in both departments, but especially in the latter, are still\r\nvery great, if not so great proportionately. We have only one poetical\r\nkind—that of Tragedy, as understood by the Greeks themselves, and\r\npractised by the three great tragedians—which has been subjected to a\r\nthorough critical examination in extant text. But then this examination\r\nis so thorough that, in reference to the particular kind, hardly\r\nanything has been added since. We have, in reference to the capital\r\nexample of another kind, Epic (again as understood by the Greeks), a\r\nlarge variety of treatments, from Aristotle to Longinus, which, if they\r\ndo not give as firm and systematic a theory of this as of the former,\r\nyet go far towards doing so. Of the remaining divisions of poetry we\r\nlearn, it must be confessed, less from the Greeks; and even in examples\r\nwe are, except in so far as the Ode and the Idyl are concerned, very\r\nlamentably ill supplied. But in the one case, as in the other, the\r\nfragments are precious. And it may in such a book as the present, be\r\npardonable once more to point to the feather in the cap of Criticism\r\nfurnished by the fact that, but for two critics, we should be destitute\r\nof these two great lyrics of Sappho which, outside the contents of\r\ndrama, are the crown and flower of Greek lyrical poetry.\r\n\r\nIn prose the same complete examination was only given, and, in the\r\nspecial conditions so often referred to, could only have been given, to\r\none, and that the least important of all the divisions of prose\r\nliterature—to Oratory. Oratory is, after all, the prose literature of\r\nthe savage. It is in no degree a contradiction to this that it should\r\nhave reached its highest pitches at periods which were not at all\r\nsavage—in the palmy days of Athens, in the agony of the Republic at\r\nRome, in the England of the eighteenth century—for it is scarcely\r\nnecessary to take into account the one period of modern times when\r\nsavagery ruled once more supreme, the French Revolution, though Oratory\r\ncertainly did then share the shameful throne. This confirms the doctrine\r\njust laid down _simpliciter_, the others confirm it indirectly. In the\r\ngreat age of Greece savagery was passing; but the efforts of\r\ncivilisation were directed to making perfect what the savage ages had\r\nregarded as most important. The whole condition of Roman life tended to\r\nsupport oratory. And in eighteenth-century England it so happened that\r\npoetry was in abeyance; prose fiction was making its way half in the\r\ndark; history was but just rising and philosophy, though still much\r\ncultivated, had not got out of the strangling grasp of Locke. Even if\r\nthese propositions be disputable, the fact of the predominance of\r\noratory in Greece is not, nor is the thoroughness (surpassing even that\r\nof the treatment of tragedy) which was accorded to its study.\r\n\r\nInadequate, however, as was the treatment of prose kinds in general by\r\nthe Greeks, even with such examples before them as Plato and Thucydides\r\nand Herodotus, they _did_ treat them: and their treatment of the main\r\ncritical aspects of prose was, if not always well directed, even more\r\nsearching and thorough than their treatment of verse. They did not\r\nneglect rhythm as it was neglected, with rare exceptions, by all modern\r\ncriticism till recently. They bestowed upon prose diction much of the\r\nsometimes to us not fully intelligible, but constantly fruitful, care\r\nwhich they had also bestowed on the diction of poetry. They hit at once\r\non the great fundamental principle—that while ordinary language breeds\r\nclearness, language of an unfamiliar character (from whatever source\r\nthat unfamiliarity may be derived) breeds the power of _striking_—which\r\nagain not all modern critics, nor even the majority of modern critics,\r\nseem to have been able to grasp. And then they hit upon the Figures.\r\n\r\nA good deal of evil—too much some may think—has here been spoken of the\r\nFigures: it will, at any rate, dispense us from saying any more in this\r\nplace, though the occasion for doing so may recur. But the good of them\r\nas an exercise—as, in the language of their own curious technique, a\r\n_progymnasma_—cannot be exaggerated. Short of the merest rote-work, the\r\nconsideration of them, the realisation of what they meant, the\r\ninvestigations necessary to refer to one or the other head the phrases\r\nof the great writers, were all of them critical processes, the defect\r\nrather than the excess of which is to be reproached upon most modern\r\ncriticism. Exclaim as we may against the practice of ticketing a\r\npeculiarity of style as if it were an atom, scientifically isolated,\r\nforeordained from the creation of things, and merely gathered and\r\napplied by the writer—yet it required at least some exercise of the pure\r\ncritical spirit to separate this atom, consider it, class it.\r\nFigure-hunting and figure-shaping may have been aberrations of the\r\ncritical spirit, but they showed that spirit: they may have led too many\r\nto acquiesce in mere terminology, but they showed the way to something\r\nvery different from any such acquiescence.\r\n\r\nIf, finally, we turn to the results of Greek criticism as applied to\r\nGreek authors, we come to a region necessarily of doubt, if not exactly\r\nof dread. The preoccupations of the writers in various directions, which\r\nhave already been mentioned, and the occasional difficulty of placing\r\nourselves at their point of view, make the necessary adjustments\r\ndifficult, but they do not make them hopeless.\r\n\r\nIn Homeric criticism, the oldest, the largest, and in some respects at\r\nleast the most interesting department of the whole subject, we find less\r\ndifference from somewhat similarly situated bodies of criticism in other\r\ntimes than might be expected by some—as little as might be expected by\r\nothers. As with Shakespeare, as with Dante, as with Cervantes, as with\r\nMolière, we find a vast body of unintelligent, if respectable, plodding,\r\nand of futile, if occasionally ingenious, crotchet and hypothesis. As in\r\nthose cases, we find the phenomenon, curious if it were not so familiar,\r\nof a sort of personal partisanship or antipathy—two things the most\r\nunfavourable to criticism, yet the most frequently found in connection\r\nwith it.[275] What we do not find, in any satisfactory measure, is\r\nliterary criticism, pure and simple. The critics are constantly drawn\r\naway to side questions, after a fashion which is only more excusable\r\nthan similar conduct in modern times because of the very different\r\nrelations in which Homer stood to the Greeks. We have talked (Heaven\r\nknows!) nonsense enough about Shakespeare as it is. How much more should\r\nwe have talked if he had been at once the oldest and greatest of our men\r\nof letters, the most ancient literary repository of our history, and a\r\nkind of Scripture, a religious document, as well? To the Greek Homer was\r\nall this, and more than all this. To the student of language he\r\npresented the oldest literary exponent of it, to the lover of poetry the\r\nadmittedly sovereign poet. But neither could bring himself to regard him\r\nmerely in these lights. The Greeks cared less than the Romans, and very\r\nmuch less than most modern nations, for personal genealogy; the personal\r\ngrudge and jealousy which is the ugliest feature of the Greek character,\r\nbut which is probably inseparable from small democratic societies, made\r\ntoo strongly against this. Very rarely do we find in Greeks any of the\r\nfeeling which made Romans cherish the notion of being descended from the\r\nfabulous companions of Æneas, and from the perhaps not fully historical\r\nheroes of the monarchy and the early republic—which, to this day, makes\r\nall, save foolish fanfarons of freedom from prejudice, rejoice in the\r\npossession, or regret the absence, of a Crusading ancestor. On the other\r\nhand, local patriotism and local pride were as notoriously strong in the\r\nGreek breast; and to the latest periods we find, not merely Homer but\r\neven Herodotus, treated exclusively as if they were stores of flattering\r\nor unflattering particulars about the critic’s birthplace and its\r\nhistory. Again, most Greeks were religious, if not quite in our way, and\r\nalmost all Greeks were interested in philosophy. With religious and even\r\nwith philosophical questions Homer had been for ages (even at the\r\nbeginning of the bulk of the literature that we have) so intimately\r\nassociated that few could disentangle themselves from the associations.\r\nIf we refuse to remember that the questions discussed resemble rather\r\nthe questions of Original Sin, or of Innate Ideas, than those of Classic\r\nand Romantic, it may astonish us that age after age should busy itself\r\nunweariedly with the discussion of Homer’s moral or immoral purpose in\r\ndepicting the scenes between Helen, Paris, and Aphrodite, between Zeus\r\nand Hera with the cestus, instead of dilating upon the character-force\r\nof the first scene and the voluptuous beauty of the second. But if we\r\nrealise the motives which actuated them, we shall be less surprised to\r\nfind so little literary criticism of Homer.\r\n\r\nFootnote 275:\r\n\r\n  Probably the very temperament, which spurs the critic on to his\r\n  business, afflicts him with this thorn in the flesh. I should not be\r\n  surprised if examples of it were found in the present volume. But it\r\n  has been kept down as far as possible.\r\n\r\nWe have far more in regard to the Tragedians, and for obvious reasons:\r\nindeed we have more strictly literary criticism in regard to the drama\r\nthan to any other division of Greek literary art. The estimates of the\r\nThree in general seem to have been not very different from what we\r\nshould expect, but still somewhat different. The magnificence of\r\nÆschylus struck the scrupulous Greek taste as too often approaching\r\nbombast, and we look with surprised disappointment for so much as a\r\nsingle appreciation of his unequalled choruses (that of Dion, noted\r\nabove, is slight and little to the point). With the Greek public\r\ngenerally Euripides seems, on the whole, and putting different times\r\ntogether, to have been the favourite of the three, and if the critics\r\nwere less favourable to him, it was rather for extra-literary than for\r\nliterary reasons. Public and critics together seem to have felt for\r\nSophocles that special esteem, as distinguished, perhaps, from actual\r\nenthusiasm, which has descended to us moderns as a sort of venerable\r\nconvention—to be acquiesced in even when we do not actively share it,\r\nand to be transformed occasionally into vehement championship. Only from\r\nLonginus do we learn that Sophocles was considered to be far from\r\nimpeccable, but to atone for his faults by his beauties: and Longinus\r\nhimself, unfortunately, does not tell us what the faults were.\r\n\r\nThe Orators have naturally been discussed with greater minuteness than\r\nany other group, nor have the results of the discussion been much\r\ninterfered with by modern study. The pre-eminence of Demosthenes was as\r\nmuch “matter of breviary” with Dionysius as with Longinus, with Longinus\r\nas with Hermogenes: and if Aristotle says little about his mighty\r\ncontemporary, we know what the great ox was that trod on his tongue.\r\nNecessarily the criticism bears largely—indeed almost entirely—on the\r\noratorical effect; but this effect, narrowly studied as it was, in the\r\nhopes of, at any rate to some extent, reproducing it, was analysed into\r\nparts which had not a little to do with literature. And, except in\r\nLonginus himself (some of whose best remarks are on the orators), there\r\nis no chapter of Greek literary criticism richer than the commentaries\r\nof Dionysius on these orators generally.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, Plato seems to have early won, and easily kept, his\r\nproper place at the head of philosophers who are men of letters, while\r\nthe more mannered graces of Isocrates seem, at least generally, to have\r\nbeen put in their proper position. That so obvious, and at the same time\r\nso complicated and tempting, a contrast as that of the historical\r\nmanners of Thucydides and Herodotus should escape quickwitted students\r\nwas of course impossible; but here those drawbacks, to which reference\r\nhas been made above, are specially apparent. The animus of Dionysius\r\nagainst the one is as patent, though not quite so stupid, as that of\r\nPlutarch or the pseudo-Plutarch against the other; and on the whole the\r\nancient critics seem to have stuck, with surprising want of energy and\r\nacuteness, in the commonplace contrast of the instructive and the\r\namusing, instead of going on to the far more interesting contrast of\r\nstrict literary manner which the two authors offer.\r\n\r\nOf the other kinds we have much more scattered and less satisfactory\r\nobservations. The Greeks were clearly not happy with their Comedy; they\r\nwere half ashamed of Aristophanes, who might suffice for the glory of a\r\nwhole literature; and they seem to have too often ranked the ingenious\r\nand fertile, but distinctly thin and “pretty,” talent of Menander above\r\nhis. The same curious kind of mistaken belittling would appear to have\r\nhung upon Lyric. Both upon these and several other kinds, from Dithyramb\r\nto Mimiambics, they remind us of the apologetic remarks of our own\r\neighteenth-century censors on the work of their own time, which, from\r\nthe point of view of universal literature, will last longest and rank\r\nhighest—fiction, essay, and the like. In fact, this mistaken calculus of\r\nappraisement of kinds is one of the main notes of the whole subject.\r\n\r\nThe punishment, as usual, has been adjusted to the crime; and the merit,\r\nas usual also, has met with its reward from the secure judgment of the\r\nworld. The more a man knows Greek literature the more deeply will he be\r\nimpressed with the inestimable services which, in criticism as\r\nelsewhere, the Greeks rendered to humanity. But the more he knows other\r\nliteratures, besides Greek, the more will he be convinced of the\r\nnecessity of enlarging, extending, and at the same time correcting, the\r\nGreek point of critical view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK II\r\n\r\n                            LATIN CRITICISM\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n      “_At demonstrare virtutes, vel si quando ita incidat vitia,\r\n      id ... maxime proprium est._”—QUINTILIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 1.\r\n\r\n       BEFORE QUINTILIAN—CICERO, HORACE, SENECA THE ELDER, VARRO.\r\n\r\nTHE CONDITIONS OF LATIN CRITICISM—CICERO—HIS ATTITUDE TO LUCRETIUS—HIS\r\n    RHETORICAL WORKS—HIS CRITICAL VOCABULARY—HORACE—THE ‘AD\r\n    PISONES’—ITS DESULTORINESS—AND ARBITRARY CONVENTIONALITY—ITS\r\n    COMPENSATIONS—BRILLIANCY—TYPICAL SPIRIT—AND PRACTICAL VALUE—THE\r\n    ‘SATIRES’ AND ‘EPISTLES’—\"DECLAMATIONS\"—THEIR SUBJECTS: EPIDEICTIC\r\n    AND FORENSIC—THEIR INFLUENCE ON STYLE—SENECA THE ELDER—THE\r\n    “SUASORIES”—THE ‘CONTROVERSIES’: THEIR INTRODUCTIONS—VARRO.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The conditions of Latin criticism._]\r\n\r\nThose who direct their literary ideas by considerations of what they\r\nthink likely to happen, or of what they think ought to have happened,\r\nwould probably expect—neither without some reason nor without a certain\r\namount of confirmation from experience—a considerable development of\r\nliterary criticism under the Latin dispensation.[276] In the first\r\nplace, the Romans had what the Greeks at first lacked, and afterwards\r\ntoo often disdained, that opportunity of Comparison, which, as has been\r\nsaid so often, is the very life and soul and breath of the higher and\r\nbetter critical exercise. In the second place, the whole literature of\r\ntheir classical period was itself a kind of critical imitation—sometimes\r\npretty slavish, sometimes freer—of Greek: and it was practically\r\nimpossible for a Roman to write without the exercise, independent or\r\nsecond-hand, of processes of study and thought which were critical or\r\nnothing. Against this must be set the facts—first, that the Latin\r\nliterary genius was somewhat timid, that it felt itself rebuked by the\r\nmajesty of Greece; and secondly, that the tendency of the race was not,\r\ntill it was much mixed with others, very decidedly literary. Few Romans\r\ndared to approach the masterpieces of Greek literary art in a thoroughly\r\ncritical spirit, and fewer had the sense of literature which might have\r\nenabled them to do so usefully. Further, their own period of consummate\r\nproduction was distinctly short, and not excessively fruitful, while\r\nthose authors of their own to whom they devoted most attention\r\nstimulated only certain kinds of criticism. Virgil and Cicero are very\r\ngreat writers, doubtless, but everybody does not feel much enthusiasm\r\nfor the first, and some people do not feel much enthusiasm for the\r\nsecond. The curious perfection of Horace is, after all, as limited as it\r\nis curious—there are no vistas in it; and the same may be said of the\r\neasy flow of Livy, the artificial, and, for its range, intense\r\nidiosyncrasy of Sallust, and the artful fancy of Ovid. These six writers\r\nseem to have always attracted the lion’s share of Roman admiration,\r\nthough at one time there might be a taste for the tricks, precious or\r\nslightly obscure, of Seneca in prose and Persius in verse, at another\r\nfor other things. For their two most poetical poets, Lucretius and\r\nCatullus, the Romans never seem to have felt any deep or widespread\r\nadmiration; their proseman of greatest genius, Tacitus, came too late,\r\nand was too unpopular in his sentiments, to attract much. Even so late\r\nas the latter days of Quintilian, when the Silver Age itself was drawing\r\nto a close, we find that it was customary to devote chief attention to\r\nGreek, and that it was thought necessary to argue for Latin as for a\r\nnovice, who, if well trained and encouraged, might become a pretty\r\nfighter in time. As for Cicero’s time, there is no reason to suppose him\r\nan exception: yet we know how, when not in full public dress, he takes\r\nrefuge in Greek at every moment, and sometimes seems almost inclined to\r\necho a phrase of Ascham’s in the dawn of modern English letters, and say\r\nit would be “more easier” for him to write in Greek, as it was for the\r\nauthor of the _Toxophilus_ to have written in Latin.\r\n\r\nFootnote 276:\r\n\r\n  I am not aware of any work, corresponding to Egger’s, in reference to\r\n  Latin Criticism. But in English there is an Essay of the first\r\n  excellence on the subject by the late Mr Henry Nettleship (reprinted\r\n  at vol. ii. p. 44 of his _Lectures and Essays_, Oxford, 1895). In my\r\n  case old personal obligations were not needed to deepen the admiration\r\n  which every one, who would even like to be a scholar, must feel for Mr\r\n  Nettleship’s work. I am here, however, to demur to his opening\r\n  division of criticism into “criticism of philosophy, which\r\n  investigates the principles of beauty,” and “isolated and spontaneous\r\n  judgments, never rising beyond personal impression.” It is one main\r\n  purpose of this book to show that a third course is possible and\r\n  desirable, by way of the wide and systematic comparison of the\r\n  manifestations of literary beauty in the accomplished work of letters.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, from Cicero that Roman literary criticism, properly so\r\ncalled, begins,[277] and he, with Horace, almost exhausts [Sidenote:\r\n_Cicero._] our supply of it from the days before the Empire. Yet he\r\nprepares us for the disappointments which meet us in Latin criticism\r\neven more than in Greek. That Cicero’s interest in literature was great\r\nno one would dream of denying. His letters swarm with quotations and\r\nliterary allusion; he is constantly arranging for new bookcases and new\r\nbooks; he no sooner has enforced (he never had much voluntary) leisure\r\nthan he sets to work to write, to translate, to compose, to discuss. But\r\nthe general inconveniences just noted, and some others of a particular\r\nnature, prevent him from being of much importance as a critic. He\r\nthought himself (as Quintilian later thought him) a philosopher, and he\r\ndevoted much time to composing agreeable but extremely diluted copies of\r\nthe Platonic dialogues. He was an orator not merely by profession but by\r\ntaste, and he has left us (even excluding the pretty certainly spurious\r\n_Ad Herennium_) a very respectable bulk of Rhetorical work. But, as we\r\nshall presently see more in detail, most of this belongs altogether to\r\nthe non-literary side of Rhetoric. Still, in default of some regular\r\ntreatise (which was hardly to be expected), it is to his abundant,\r\nvaried, and interesting correspondence that we should look for material,\r\nand we find very little of it. Here is a joke on the habit of\r\nAristarchus (and indeed of other critics), the habit of marking as\r\nspurious anything they do not like: there an equally jocular\r\nintroduction of rhetorical technicalities; elsewhere a rather curious\r\nbut more linguistic than literary disquisition on the way in which\r\ninnocent words and phrases acquire, half by accident, awkward double\r\nmeanings, or slip into the single bad meaning only. There is a passage\r\nof some interest in a letter to Atticus about Cicero’s lost Greek\r\nhistory of his consulship, where he describes himself as having used up\r\nall Isocrates' perfume-shop, and the cabinets of his disciples, and even\r\nAristotelian pigments.[278]\r\n\r\nFootnote 277:\r\n\r\n  The actual primacy is assigned to a verse canon of the Ten Latin Comic\r\n  Poets by a certain Volcatius Sedigitus, who may be close to 100 B.C.\r\n  This “stupid production,” as Mr Nettleship unkindly but most justly\r\n  calls it, may be found in his Essay (so often quoted) in Aulus\r\n  Gellius, xv. 24, or in Baehrens' _Poetæ Latini Minores_, vi. 279. The\r\n  six-fingered one puts Cæcilius first, Plautus second, Terence sixth,\r\n  Ennius tenth, _antiquitatis causa_. He had, of course, borrowed the\r\n  “canon” system from the Alexandrians, among whose most dubious\r\n  services to criticism the arrangement of such things must be placed.\r\n  There are touches of literary and critical reference in Ennius, in the\r\n  Prologues of Terence, &c., but nothing that need delay us.\r\n\r\nFootnote 278:\r\n\r\n  _Ad Att._, ii. 1: _Meus autem liber totum Isocratis_ μυροθήκιον,\r\n  _atque omnes ejus discipulorum arculas, ac nonnihil etiam Aristotelia\r\n  pigmenta consumpsit_.\r\n\r\nBut the most direct and famous piece of pure literary criticism in the\r\nletters is an unlucky one. Cicero of course came [Sidenote: _His\r\nattitude to Lucretius._] before—or rather himself led—the most brilliant\r\nage of Latin, and could not have so much as seen the work of Virgil, of\r\nHorace, much less of Ovid, and others. But he could and he did know\r\nLucretius, whose work an absurd tradition has it that he even revised.\r\nAnd what does he say of this mighty poet, who unites the poignancy of\r\nCatullus to the sustained grasp of Virgil, and adds a sublimity unknown\r\nto both? The manuscripts are said to read: _Lucretii poemata, ut\r\nscribis, ita sunt: multis luminibus ingenii multæ tamen artis_.[279] The\r\nearlier editors most naturally considered this sentence nonsense. No\r\ndoubt the opposition of _ingenium_ and _ars_ is a common thing, almost a\r\ncommonplace, in Latin. But would any one, unless he had a thesis to\r\nprove, dream of regarding _tamen_ as admissible here? of translating it\r\nas if it were _necnon_? There is, of course, a certain paradoxical sense\r\nin which, at the end of the nineteenth century, a brisk young critic\r\nmight say of Mr X., “He has plenty of brains, _and yet_ he really knows\r\nhow to write.” But this is not in the least Roman; and it is Ciceronian\r\nrather less than it is Roman generally. Some, recognising that there\r\nmust have been a _non_ somewhere, put it before _multæ_, and suppose\r\nthat Cicero, as if he had been accustomed to Virgilian smoothness,\r\nthought Lucretius rough. But this, from his own verses, is very\r\nunlikely. The natural emendation is to put the _non_ (as till recently\r\nit used always to be supplied) before _multis_, which emendation, and\r\nwhich alone, makes the sentence run as, without prejudice on the score\r\nof the special meaning, we should expect it to run: “The poems of\r\nLucretius are, as you say, not very full of brilliancy in genius, but\r\nshow plenty of art.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 279:\r\n\r\n  _Ep. Ad Quint._, _Frat._, ii. 11 (9 in some edd.)\r\n\r\nSupposing this to be so, some have tried to make out that Cicero’s\r\nwell-known dislike of the Epicurean tenets accounts for the unfavourable\r\ncriticism. So much the worse for him as a literary critic if it was so.\r\nA man who cannot taste Shelley because Shelley attacks Christianity, or\r\nlaugh at the _Twopenny Postbag_ because Moore was a Whig, may be, and\r\nvery likely is, an honour to his species as a man, but the less said\r\nabout him as a critic of literature the better. But there is no real\r\nprobability of such a plea having any foundation. We shall see what\r\nQuintilian says about Lucretius later: we know that very few other Latin\r\nwriters say anything about him at all. Cicero, who would fain have been\r\na poet, and who sometimes could hammer out a tolerable hexameter,[280]\r\ncould not as a mere craftsman, as a mere student of Rhetoric, fail to\r\nappreciate something of the “art” of Lucretius. The stately volume of\r\nthose magnificent hexameters—the _ne plus ultra_ of their kind in more\r\nways than one or two—could not but appeal to him as a mere connoisseur\r\nof Latin rhythm, which (put him high or low in general literature) he\r\nmost certainly was. The difference in comparison with Ennius, as a\r\nmatter of art, was for such a man as Cicero simply unmistakable.\r\n\r\nFootnote 280:\r\n\r\n  It has been urged upon me that my judgment of Cicero’s verse is rather\r\n  harsh, and that he at any rate made some progress towards the\r\n  Lucretian hexameter before Lucretius. It may be so; tolerably careful\r\n  and tolerably wide students of literature know that these things are\r\n  always “in the air,” and that, sometimes if not always, you find them\r\n  in the poetaster before you find them in the poet. But after reading\r\n  all Cicero’s extant verse two or three times over, seeking diligently\r\n  for mitigations of judgment, I am still afraid that “Cousin Cicero,\r\n  you will never be a poet,” would have been, and justly, the verdict of\r\n  Lucretius, had they stood to one another in the relations in which\r\n  Swift and Dryden stood.\r\n\r\nBut the qualities of the Lucretian “genius,” as distinguished from the\r\nLucretian art, were not suited to attract Cicero—were, we may say,\r\nwithout fear of injustice, suited to attract very few Romans of the true\r\ntype.[281] That type was, as far as the defects went, distinctly\r\n“barbarian,” in the sense in which Mr Matthew Arnold (very unjustly)\r\napplied the word to the English aristocracy—full of vigour, instinct\r\nwith the faculty of ruling, magnanimous after a fashion, but\r\nimpenetrable to ideas, only formally religious, shutting off its keen\r\nperception of a certain justice with huge blinkers, and, above all,\r\ncuriously insensible to the vague, the mystical, the sense of wonder.\r\nNow, Lucretius, though he had chosen for himself a creed approaching\r\nmere materialism, had treated it in a fashion constantly and unabashedly\r\nideal. It does not need the “flaming bastions of the world” or the sense\r\nof the _néant_, splendidly as he can describe both, to awake the\r\npoetical faculty in him. He can make poetry out of the _exiguum\r\nclinamen_, and out of things less promising if even more abstract still.\r\nWith him it is always “the riding that does it”; the subject hardly\r\nmatters at all. Lucretius, in short, was one of the great poets—sheerly\r\nand merely as poets—of the world. The didactics in which our\r\neighteenth-century versemen so dismally failed offer no more\r\ndifficulties to him than a love-poem or a flowery description. He will\r\ndo you a science, or an atomic system, as another might do an Odyssey or\r\na story of Lancelot. Now this was what the ancients, with all their\r\nacuteness and originality, could seldom understand or like; and what\r\nCicero (a man of genius in some ways, but something of a Philistine and\r\nnothing of a poet) could like least of all those who can in any way be\r\ncompared with him. Many of the beauties of the Lucretian imagination\r\nwould be no doubt simply lost on him; and others he would consider\r\nwasted on the wrong subjects, if not positively applied in the wrong\r\nmanner. Let us, however, for fairness' sake, accept the MS. reading,\r\nallow that _tamen_ may be the same or nearly the same as _necnon_, and\r\nfurther allow that as Marcus is only echoing words of Quintus which we\r\ndo not possess, equity would in any case require that we should lay no\r\nvery great stress on his own. There will still remain the objection that\r\na poem of this character and importance, brought directly under his\r\nnotice, and already as is clear within his knowledge, does not tempt him\r\nto do anything more than echo his correspondent’s words in a\r\ncut-and-dried formula which would be applicable to any tolerably good\r\ncomposition in verse, and which does not touch nor approach the\r\nidiosyncrasy of the poem itself. We cannot therefore very greatly regret\r\nthat we have so little pure literary criticism from him. But still we\r\nmust, for the sake of completeness, give some account of his Rhetorical\r\nworks, which, in a manner, play the same complementary part to the _Ars\r\nPoetica_ of Horace that the twin treatises of the Stagirite play to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nFootnote 281:\r\n\r\n  It is one of Ovid’s titles (_v. infra_) to credit as a critic that he\r\n  did see the value of Lucretius, and expressed it in the well-known\r\n  couplet (_Amor._, i. 15. 25)—\r\n\r\n              “_Carmina sublimis tunc sunt peritura Lucreti,\r\n              Exitio terras quum dabit una dies._”\r\n\r\n  Virgil’s still better known quit-rent for his borrowings (_Georg._,\r\n  ii. 490) is a mere praise of the Lucretian _free-thought_, with no\r\n  reference to poetry. But the praise (no mean one) of having\r\n  appreciated Lucretius better than any other Roman is due to Statius\r\n  (_v. infra_, pp. 268-270).\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no small difference between the values of the\r\nRhetorical works themselves. The _Ad Herennium_, even if [Sidenote: _His\r\nRhetorical works._] it were as certainly Cicero’s as it is almost\r\ncertainly not his, would require very small attention, for it is a\r\nstrict _Techne_ or Art of Rhetoric, of the kind which we have thoroughly\r\nexamined in the First Book, rigidly limited to Oratory, and containing\r\nnothing that may not be found in a dozen or a hundred other places. The\r\n_De Inventione_—more probably, if still not certainly, Cicero’s—is\r\nequally technical, and has hardly anything of interest for us except a\r\nquotation from Curio, which gives the lie direct to the “saw” of our\r\n“dead shepherd,”[282] _Nemo potest uno aspectu neque præteriens in\r\namorem incidere_. It is to Cicero’s credit that he cites this as a\r\nrhetorical assumption, as saying that what happens rarely does not\r\nhappen at all. The _De Oratore_ looks more promising, especially as\r\nthere are references, in its very _exordia_, to the study of letters and\r\nits difficulty. There is a passage of some interest in Book II., cap.\r\n12, 13, on the connection of oratory and history, with a short review of\r\nthe Greek historians; and another of somewhat wider reference in cap. 7\r\nof Book III., besides, it may be, others still here and there,\r\nespecially that which begins about the 37th chapter of the third book.\r\nThe _Brutus_ is the best of all, with its survey of the Latin orators\r\nand its account of the author’s literary education. The _Orator_ deals\r\nstill more closely with oratorical style, as does the little tract, _De\r\nOptimo Genere Oratorum_. The _Partitiones_ and the _Topica_ are again\r\nmainly, if not even merely, technical.\r\n\r\nFootnote 282:\r\n\r\n  _As You Like It_, iii. 5. 82.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this, not only that there is little purely literary\r\ncriticism in Cicero, but that it is rather unjust to expect any from\r\nhim. It was not his business; he had hardly any examples of it before\r\nhim (and Cicero, like most other Latins, was a man who could do little\r\nwithout a pattern); the mere subject-matter (at least as far as Latin\r\nwas concerned) was far from very abundant or specially interesting.\r\nMoreover, he was constantly occupied on other things. We know, from\r\npassages cited above, and others, that he had the purely grammatical and\r\nlexicographical interest which was so strong in the Romans; he must have\r\nhad real feeling for poetry, or he would not be so constantly quoting\r\nit, nor would he have made his unequal attempts at writing it; he would\r\nfain, in the same way, have been a historian. But these were mere\r\npastimes; and both from that vanity which was his master passion, and\r\nfrom an honest conviction which, as we have seen, was widely spread in\r\nantiquity, he seems to have thought Oratory the roof and crown of things\r\nliterary, the queen of literary kinds, to which all others were\r\nancillary, pedagogic, mere exercising-grounds and sources of convenient\r\nornament. No one so thinking could make any great proficiency in\r\nliterary criticism, and Cicero did not make any such.\r\n\r\nThis estimate of Cicero may seem audaciously unfair, if not grossly\r\nincompetent, to those who accept the more usual one. So far as much, if\r\nnot all, very high authority goes, I must acknowledge, though I do not\r\nrecant, my heresy. Mr Nettleship, for instance, while acknowledging that\r\nCicero “threw his whole strength into the criticism of oratorical\r\nprose,” still speaks of his work, especially of the _Brutus_, with\r\nsomething like enthusiasm, claims “genius” and “fulness of light” for\r\nhim, and even makes what is to me, I confess, the astonishing remark\r\nthat he “follows in the same track as the Greek critics in all\r\nprobability had done before him, as undoubtedly Dionysius _and the\r\nauthor of the_ Περὶ Ὕψους did after him.” I should have myself thought\r\nthat if there were two critics who might be pedantically symbolised as A\r\nand not-A, they were Cicero and Longinus. But to give the other side, in\r\nthe case of so important a client with such an admirable advocate, I may\r\nsay that Mr Nettleship, while admitting Cicero’s tendency to the wooden\r\nplacing and comparison borrowed from the Greeks, and naturally made more\r\nwooden by the Latins, and granting his inadequacy as to History (which\r\nhe, like so many others whom we have seen and shall see, regards as a\r\nmere _ancilla_ of Oratory), claims for him the origination of the\r\nprinciple that the general as well as the connoisseurs must stamp the\r\nvalue of a work (_Brutus_, 183), approves his distaste (_De Oratore_,\r\niii. 96) for “precious” style, and gives a most interesting _cento_ from\r\nthe _Brutus_ (93, 125, 139, 143, 148, 201, 261, 274, 301). In these\r\ncharacterisations of the great orators he finds qualities of the highest\r\nkind, completing the panegyric by saying, “His usual prolixity is thrown\r\naside, and he returns to obey the true laws of expression. As a critic\r\nhe can write with all Tacitus' terseness and without any of Tacitus'\r\naffectation.” I quote, though—and indeed because—I cannot agree.\r\n\r\nOne point of great interest, however, in which there may be general\r\nagreement as to Cicero’s achievement, Mr Nettleship [Sidenote: _His\r\nCritical Vocabulary._] did not treat in his Essay, though a passage\r\ntherein leads straight to it. This passage gives a very useful list[283]\r\n(elsewhere referred to) of some of the technical terms of criticism\r\nwhich appear to have accumulated in Greek literature during the\r\npost-Aristotelian period. Some of these are either used in their\r\nordinary sense, or in senses easily and closely tropical; others are\r\nmore far-fetched, and, as has also been noted elsewhere, remind one of\r\nthe technicalities of wine-tasting (especially in French), or of\r\npictorial art. Some are very hard to render exactly in other languages.\r\n\r\nFootnote 283:\r\n\r\n  τραχύς, αὐστηρός, αὐθαδής, αὐχμηρός, εὐπινής, στρυφνός, συνεσπασμένος,\r\n  ἀντίτυπος, ἀρχαϊκός, πυκνός, δεινός, &c. Mr Nettleship gives in all\r\n  thirty-three, to which, I daresay, one could add as many more from the\r\n  later rhetoricians, Longinus, and others down to Photius.\r\n\r\nIt has always been noticed that Cicero—a master of language, and though\r\nfar from the pedantic prejudice which then tabooed Greek words in Latin,\r\njust as it now taboos French words in English, always anxious to enrich\r\nhis own tongue when he could—has shown special ingenuity in translating,\r\nparaphrasing, and adding to this rhetorical and critical dictionary. It\r\nis not, however, very many years since the interesting labour of a\r\nFrench scholar[284] made it possible, without very considerable trouble\r\non one’s own part, to get the results of this process ready for study.\r\nWith the Ciceronian terms of mere forensic Rhetoric (though all students\r\nof the Greek and Latin Rhetoricians will agree with M. Causeret that\r\nthese terms have been, with a very mischievous result, transferred to\r\nother branches) we need not busy ourselves. It is under the usual head\r\nof “Elocution” that we shall find most to interest us. The abundance of\r\nthe Ciceronian vocabulary every one will recognise; it is less certain\r\nwhether we are to admire its precision. But it is at least an innocent,\r\nand may sometimes be a profitable, pleasure to classify the usages of\r\n_inusitatum_ and _insolens_, to separate the _nuances_ of _obsoletum_,\r\n_priscum_, and _vetustum_, of _grandia_ and _gravia_, of _majestas_ and\r\n_splendor_. The Latin rather than the Teutonic languages admit the\r\ndistinctions of _juncta_, _cohærentia_, _apta_, and _coagmentata_, if\r\ndistinction there be; but it would be of real value to ascertain whether\r\nthere was any between _modus_ and _numerus_. Sometimes at least it seems\r\nas if it might coincide with that between “rhythm” and “metre”: while\r\noften _numerus_ itself seems to be “rhythm.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 284:\r\n\r\n  _Etude sur la Langue de la Rhétorique et de la Critique Littéraire\r\n  dans Cicéron._ Par C.

Paris, 1886.\r\n\r\nBy no means uninteresting, again, are the numerous metaphorical\r\nexpressions from actual physiology—_lacerti_, _sanguis_, _nervi_,\r\n_succus_, _exsanguis_, _enervatus_—which we find applied to style, and\r\nthe still more numerous but vaguer terms, most of them with modern\r\nequivalents, which express its qualities by comparison with moral ones.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to see what an influence the use of such terms by\r\nsuch an author must have had, and we shall find evidences much later (in\r\nPliny, for instance) that the language of literary criticism at Rome\r\nyielded in nothing to that beautiful dialect which enables our own\r\ncensors to speak of a novel as “assertive and challenging,” of the\r\n“swiftness and fusion” of its style. But whether the influence was as\r\nbeneficial as it was great is perhaps rather a different question.[285]\r\n\r\nFootnote 285:\r\n\r\n  It has not seemed necessary to go through the literary passages of the\r\n  _Orations_, though some, the _Pro Archia_ especially, are not\r\n  infertile in them. “What _counsel_ says is not evidence,” whatever\r\n  else it is.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the limited and partial relevance of Aristotle’s\r\n_Rhetoric_ to literary criticism, and the complete if [Sidenote:\r\n_Horace._] still limited relevance of his _Poetics_, is repeated far\r\nmore pointedly in that between the Rhetorical works of Cicero and the\r\nso-called _Ars Poetica_ of Horace. It is, in fact—though the most ardent\r\nadmirers of the Venusian would fain defend it from being intentionally\r\nand originally an Art of Poetry at all—the most complete, nay, the only\r\ncomplete, example of literary criticism that we have from any\r\nRoman.[286] As in other similar cases, before saying much about it in\r\nthe way of secondary comment, it will be well to give a fairly full\r\nanalysis of it, which can be the better done because of its extreme\r\nshortness. The famous tags with which it abounds, to an extent almost\r\nunmatched, may be sometimes, but need not be always, given in full.\r\n\r\nFootnote 286:\r\n\r\n  Here, however, as elsewhere, the fatally parasitic character of the\r\n  whole literature comes in. There is little doubt (see Nettleship, _op.\r\n  cit._) that the piece was very closely modelled upon the work of a\r\n  certain Neoptolemus of Parium, an Alexandrian critic, whose date is\r\n  not known.\r\n\r\nIn form it is merely an _Epistola ad Pisones_, and plunges at [Sidenote:\r\n_The_ Ad Pisones.] once into its subject, without any attempt at\r\npreliminary argument or flourish.\r\n\r\nThe representations of art, like the presentations of nature, must be\r\ncharacterised by appropriateness of parts; you must not simply join\r\nanything to anything else. Perhaps, says an objector; but surely\r\npainters and poets enjoy liberty of fancy. Certainly; but still some\r\npropriety must be observed. Even ornament must be adjusted to the\r\nsubject; and even when correctness itself is specially attempted,\r\ndefects wait on the attempt—obscurity on brevity, bombast on flights,\r\ntameness on simplicity. Take care that your subject suits both your\r\nstyle and your powers.\r\n\r\nThen, as to vocabulary? There is no reason why old words should not be\r\nresuscitated and new ones coined, provided that both things are done\r\n“with brains” and discretion. Usage is the arbiter, and what usage will\r\nnot admit must be content to perish. As for metre, the kinds appropriate\r\nto the various subjects have been long ago settled, though by whom is\r\nnot always known—hexameters for Epic by Homer, elegiacs for less\r\nimportant matter by somebody or other, iambics for satire by\r\nArchilochus, and so on with tragedy, comedy, lyric, and the rest. It is\r\nnot wise to alter this established order.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, the established styles and characters must be\r\nmaintained: a tragic hero must not speak like a comic one, or _vice\r\nversâ_; and you must not attempt new lights on the character of accepted\r\nheroes and heroines like Achilles and Odysseus and Medea. At the same\r\ntime, you need not cling to the stock subjects, and if you take quite\r\nnovel ones you may handle your character as you like, provided it keep\r\nuniformity throughout. But you may be wiser if you stick to the\r\nold.[287] If you do, do not begin too magniloquently; bustle your reader\r\nwell along in the action; and drop the ungrateful parts of the story.\r\n\r\nAs before for traditional characters, so for the stock parts. Generalise\r\nand conventionalise wisely; let your boys be childish; your youths fond\r\nof sport, reckless, and fickle; your men of full age, business-like and\r\nprudent; your old men praisers of the past, sluggish, grudging, and so\r\nforth. In short—Keep to the Type.\r\n\r\nFootnote 287:\r\n\r\n  Here comes in one of the most famous and often-quoted of the\r\n  “tags”—_difficile est proprie communia dicere_, a sentence which,\r\n  hackneyed as it is, is not altogether easy to translate fully even by\r\n  itself, and becomes in the context less easy still.\r\n\r\nIn play-writing be careful how you utilise the double opportunity of\r\nrepresentation and narrative. Do not let ugly things appear on the\r\nactual stage. Stick to your five acts; do not be prodigal of your _deus\r\nex machina_; do not introduce a fourth personage. Keep your chorus to\r\nits business—moral sentiment, religious tone, and so forth. This caution\r\nintroduces a long digression on the incursion of elaborate music into\r\nthe stage, and on the combination (while keeping them _unmixed_) of\r\nSatiric Drama and Tragedy.\r\n\r\nThen, with the almost shorthand abruptness of transition which\r\ncharacterises the poem, we pass to an incidental consideration of\r\nmetres. An iambic is a long syllable put after a short one, and you\r\narrange them in batches of six with, in certain places only, spondees\r\nfor a change. Do not take too many licences: stick to the Greek. If your\r\nancestors were fools enough to admire Plautus you need not. They say\r\nThespis invented drama, or at least tragedy. Æschylus improved it and\r\nmade it magniloquent. Then came the Old Comedy—rather too licentious, so\r\nthat it had to pull in its sails and drop its chorus. We have tried all\r\nsorts, not without success, but the labour of the file is absolutely\r\nnecessary. The idea of poetic madness and excess is all nonsense. If I\r\ncannot write great poetry I can teach others how to write it. Be careful\r\nof your subject, and do not attend to tuneful trifles.\r\n\r\nYou must either instruct or delight, or both; you must not write\r\nromantic and prodigious extravagances. Mix pleasure with profit and you\r\nare safe. You need not be absolutely faultless, but avoid faults as much\r\nas you can. Be careful to suit the style to the subject as much as\r\npossible, and do not “pad.” Mediocre poetry is intolerable.\r\n\r\nFinally, do not be in a hurry to publish; invite friendly criticism; do\r\nnot force yourself; destroy a good deal. For _nescit vox missa reverti_.\r\n\r\nThe influence of poets is mythically signified by the stories of\r\nOrpheus, who moved beasts, and Amphion, who built Thebes by song. Homer\r\ncame next, and was famous. Tyrtæus roused men to war. Many kinds of\r\npoetry have been discovered since, and they all need hard work to\r\ncultivate them with success. Some remarks on recitation follow, and then\r\nthe lines on which friendly criticism should proceed are drawn, and the\r\npiece ends rather ambiguously with a reference to the fate of\r\nEmpedocles.\r\n\r\nNow, in criticising this criticism we must of course take into\r\nconsideration the plea that Horace may not have meant to give [Sidenote:\r\n_Its desultoriness_] a regular treatise even on Dramatic Poetry, but\r\nmerely to throw out a few observations for the benefit of a friend. It\r\nis still more obvious that we must not saddle him with all the rubbish\r\nof corollary and comment with which he has been loaded (sometimes\r\nwithout his having in the least deserved or provoked it) by the\r\n“Classical” critics of the 16th-18th centuries. Yet not merely equitable\r\nbut generous allowances of this kind will still leave the piece open to\r\npretty severe comment. In the first place, its desultoriness is\r\nexcessive, even extravagant. Much licence in this respect no doubt must\r\nbe allowed to the “mixer of the useful and the pleasant” by means of\r\nverse-didactics. But no possible licence will cover Horace’s method, or\r\nabsence of method. He begins with a sufficiently lively diatribe against\r\ninconsistency of design and want of harmony of parts, then slides to\r\nmethods of composition, thence to vocabulary, thence to the technical\r\ndivisions of prosody, thence to stock characters and the selection of\r\nsubject, gives cautions as to the minor and more arbitrary proprieties\r\nof the stage, indulges in a little bit of literary history, returns to\r\nmetres, insists on the importance of self- and other criticism. Then he\r\nshifts artfully to the contrast between Greek emulation and Roman\r\nshopkeeping covetousness, extols Orpheus and Amphion, Homer and Tyrtæus,\r\nexcuses faults if they are not too many, but will not tolerate mere even\r\nmediocrity, cautions against flattering hearers, and ends with a\r\ndescription, half sarcastic, half rallying the sarcasm, of bad poets. If\r\nit were not for its vividness and its constellation of glittering\r\nphrases, nobody could see in such a thing aught but a mere congeries of\r\ndesultory observations.\r\n\r\nStill more indisputable is the singular spirit of routine—of\r\nred-tape—which pervades the piece. Aristotle (whom Horace follows\r\nwithout direct acknowledgment, and by no means slavishly, but still on\r\nthe whole) had been sufficiently positive, and not seldom a little\r\narbitrary; but he had carefully abstained [Sidenote: _and arbitrary\r\nconventionality._] from mere red-tape. Horace, in his prescription of\r\nthe five acts, and his proscription of the fourth actor, measures that\r\ntape off in a fashion which implies one of two things, both of them\r\nbad—either implicit belief in purely arbitrary rules, or indifference to\r\nthe mischief that such rules may do. Elsewhere, though his good sense\r\nsometimes interferes to advantage, he is, though less meticulously, as\r\nslavishly conventional. You must use the consecrated metres, and no\r\nothers, for the various subjects; you must keep to the accepted\r\nlineaments of well-known characters, and you must model your new ones\r\nstrictly on types. Decency, propriety, convention—to these things you\r\nmust look throughout. If you are really a great poet you may be allowed\r\na “fault” or two, as a great beauty is allowed a mole, but still it is a\r\n“fault.” And so this kind of pottering and peddling censorship goes on\r\nthrough the whole. We are at such an antithesis or antipodes to the Περὶ\r\nὝψους, that one sometimes feels inclined to give the _Ars Poetica_ a\r\nthird title and call it Περὶ μεσότητος, or _De Mediocritate_, so\r\ndirectly does it tend to produce the quality which, in one of its own\r\nhappier moments, it denounces.\r\n\r\nAll this, I say, is undeniable, or, if it be denied, the denial is of no\r\nconsequence. But the compensatory merits are very considerable.\r\n[Sidenote: _Its compensations: Brilliancy._] In the first place, it is\r\nno small thing to have got once more to purely, or almost purely,\r\nliterary criticism, to have done with the sense that literature as such\r\nis only the second thought, the _parergon_, at best the mere means, not\r\nthe end, to the critic. In the second place, it is a greater thing still\r\nto have our literary criticism, now that we have got it, done by such a\r\nman as Horace, one in whom the generation of the critic has not waited\r\nfor the corruption of the poet,[288] and who has the peculiar gift of\r\ncrisp rememberable felicitous phrase. The few hundred lines of the\r\nlittle piece are positively “made of quotations.” Every man of letters,\r\nat least, ought to have learnt it by heart in the original during his\r\nyouth. Yet even to those who have not been thus favoured, but who have\r\nsome tincture of Humanity, mere scraps and tags of it must often recall\r\nthe actual context, or at least the sense. The first five-and-twenty\r\nlines contain, in the way of such “lights” of phrase, at least seven:—\r\n\r\n            “Desinat in piscem mulier formosa superne.\r\n            Risum teneatis, amici.\r\n            Velut ægri somnia....\r\n            Pictoribus atque poetis\r\n            Quidlibet audendi semper fuit æqua potestas ...\r\n            Petimusque damusque vicissim.\r\n            Purpureus ... pannus ...\r\n            Currente rota cur urceus exit?”\r\n\r\nAnd the proportion is well maintained throughout.\r\n\r\nFootnote 288:\r\n\r\n  I had hoped that no reader would want explanation of this, but it has\r\n  been hinted to me that some may. For them only, I note that the\r\n  saying, the thought of which has found various and frequent\r\n  expression, is slightly altered in form from Dryden, and is one of his\r\n  happiest scholasticisms. It glances, utilising the old philosophical\r\n  opposition-connection of γένεσις and φθορά, at the theory, put later\r\n  by another person of genius more bluntly, that critics are those who\r\n  “have failed in literature and art.”\r\n\r\nBut the greatest value of the piece, beyond all doubt, is the clear and\r\ndistinct idea which it gives of one, and that [Sidenote: _Typical\r\nspirit_] the principal, side of the critical conception of literature in\r\nRoman times certainly, in all times more or less. Just as, and in the\r\nsame manner as, we said that Longinus plays the exception among the\r\ncritics of antiquity, so does Horace represent the rule. There is indeed\r\nsomething in other critics of antiquity of the spirit which makes\r\nLonginus pre-eminent, but it is not prominent in them. There is in the\r\nbetter of them, especially in Aristotle, much that is not in Horace; but\r\nwhat they have in common with him is the differentia of them all.\r\n\r\nOf this latter spirit those worse points which we have noted in the\r\npiece are the caricature or corruption, the others are the rational\r\nembodiment and expression. “Observe order; do not grovel or soar too\r\nhigh; stick to the usage of reasonable and well-bred persons; be\r\nneither stupid nor shocking; above all, be like the best of your\r\npredecessors, stick to the norm of the class, do not attempt a perhaps\r\nimpossible and certainly dangerous individuality.” In short the false\r\n_mimesis_—imitation of previous art—is mixing herself up more and more\r\nwith the true _mimesis_, representation of nature. If it is not\r\nexactly true that, as a modern prose Horace has it, _Tout est dit_, at\r\nany rate the forms in which everything ought to be said have long been\r\nfound out. You cannot improve on them: try to make the best use of\r\nthem that you can.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say with what hardly matched and certainly unsurpassed\r\nshrewdness and neatness Horace has—not merely in the tags, the phrases,\r\nthe purple patches themselves [Sidenote: _and practical value._] noted\r\nabove, but throughout—set forth, enforced, decorated his views. Except\r\nin a few extremest moods, when the whole world of literature seems to be\r\nat once painted red and strangled with the tape that paints it, he is\r\nnever absurd; he is never even negligible. The most “dishevelled”\r\nRomantic may neglect him, but the neglect will always be at his own\r\nperil—he must be a Shakespeare, or at least a Marlowe, a Shelley, or at\r\nleast a Beddoes, if he flies in the face of the Horatian precepts. These\r\nprecepts even, in the opening, in the “mediocrity” remark, in the\r\nperoration and elsewhere, contain not a little antidote for their own\r\nbane. “Not worth writing” would be the Horatian verdict on many a\r\n“Classical” poem which the judge might acknowledge to be quite\r\nunobjectionably written; while on the other hand the evils of\r\nextravagance, of disproportion, of tedious and silly crotchet and\r\ncaprice, at which he drives full from first to last, are real evils, and\r\nby no means to be minimised. It is not rash to say—though perhaps one\r\nmust have read more literatures, and passed through more phases of\r\nliterary judgment than one, before saying it with conviction—that there\r\nis no school or period of literary practice in which the precepts of\r\nHorace, when rightly taken, have lost, or are ever likely to lose,\r\ncritical validity. To say this is to say a very great deal. But it is\r\nnot inconsistent with—and it makes especially necessary—the further\r\nobservation that the critical attitude of Horace is a wofully incomplete\r\none. In the first place, he has left us no really “grasping” judgment of\r\na single writer he has mentioned. He had not much room, but nobody could\r\nput a paragraph in a line better than he could, when he understood and\r\ncared for the matter. Horace on Orpheus and Amphion, on Homer, nay, on\r\nÆschylus and Plautus, is _banal_—badly _banal_, one may add. But let us\r\ngrant that the knack of luminous summarising of the individual was not,\r\nand could not be, yet born, was not even with Longinus, was not even\r\nfifteen hundred years after Horace. His shortcomings do not cease here.\r\nHere as elsewhere, except in a few passages of the graver philosophy of\r\nlife, there is no “soul” in him. He has no enthusiasm, no passion. It is\r\nperhaps improper to bring together Horace and Mr Browning, but I never\r\nread the _Epistola ad Pisones_ without thinking of certain lines of the\r\nlatter:—\r\n\r\n      “The fool! would he try a flight further and say,\r\n      He never saw, never, before to-day,\r\n      What was able to take his breath away—\r\n      A face to lose youth for, to occupy age\r\n      With the dream of, meet death with—why, I'll not engage\r\n      But that, half in a rapture and half in a rage,\r\n      I should toss him the thing’s self, ‘’Tis only a duplicate,\r\n      A thing of no value—take it, I supplicate.’”\r\n\r\nLonginus, one feels, would have been in some danger of losing his\r\nliterary loves on this principle; the modern critic can “say ditto to Mr\r\nBrowning” over a thousand passages. But Horace was quite safe. He never\r\nfelt this enthusiasm for author, or book, or page; and so he never\r\ntried, as others in their despairing way do, to render a reason for it.\r\n\r\nTo those who consider criticism as a whole and historically, the\r\nenormous influence which the _Ars Poetica_ has exercised [Sidenote:\r\n_The_ Satires _and_ Epistles.] must always give it the prerogative place\r\namong its author’s critical work. But it is needless to say that he has\r\nother claims to appear here. And the pieces which give him these claims\r\nhave by some been considered more important, as they certainly are more\r\noriginal. It is unnecessary to pick out _Pindarum quisquis_ and the\r\nother literary references in the Odes, universally known, admirably\r\nexpressed, but as criticism hardly more than a refashioning of _publica\r\nmateries_. The Fourth and Sixth _Satires_ of the First book, which are\r\nprobably a good deal earlier than the adaptation from Neoptolemus, and\r\nthe two _Epistles_ of the Second book, which may be taken as later, are\r\nserious documents. The Satires perhaps give a better opinion of Horace’s\r\ntalent than of his taste and temper. His critics had praised Lucilius\r\nagainst him; and without denying his predecessor all merit, he makes,\r\nthough less generously, the sort of comment which even Dryden made on\r\nthe rough versification and lack of art of the giant race before the\r\nflood. This (i. 4) naturally brought fresh attacks on him, and in i. 10\r\nhe returns to the subject, lashes the _fautores ineptos Lucili_,\r\nindulges in the too famous sneer at Catullus and Calvus, and with a\r\ntouch of something which is perhaps not quite alien from snobbishness,\r\nboasts his intimacy and agreement not merely with Varius, Virgil,\r\nPollio, Messala, among men of letters, but with Mæcenas and Octavius.\r\n\r\nHis general position here is easy enough to perceive, and there are of\r\ncourse defences for it. Among all our thousand fragments of\r\nLucilius,[289] but two or three at most are long enough to give us any\r\nidea of his faculty of sustained composition. And fine as is the\r\nfragment to Albinus—with its Elizabethan reiteration of _virtus_ at the\r\nbeginning of the lines, its straight-hitting sense, and the positive\r\nnobility of its ethic—numerous as are the instances in the smaller\r\nscraps of _Romana simplicitas_ and picturesque phrase, there is no doubt\r\nthat the whole is rough and unfinished, not with the roughness of one\r\nwho uses a rudimentary art, but of one who has not mastered—perhaps, as\r\nHorace insinuates, has not taken the trouble to master—one ready to his\r\nhand. But there is something of the Frenchman’s “_We_ are all princes or\r\npoets” about the tone of Horace himself. He is, _mutatis mutandis_, too\r\nmuch in the mood of a _parvenu_ who has just been admitted to an\r\nexclusive club, and thinks very meanly of poor wretches who are not\r\nentitled to use the club-paper.\r\n\r\nFootnote 289:\r\n\r\n  _Poet. Lat. Min._ (Baehrens), vi. 139-266. Our greatest English\r\n  Latinists recently have been singularly unkind to this poet. Munro\r\n  made what I can only call a violent attack on him: and Mr Nettleship,\r\n  while allowing him “extraordinary vigour” and “the ring of Caius\r\n  Gracchus” (see his Essay on the Satires (second series), where Munro’s\r\n  diatribe is quoted), practically indorses this. Against such judges I\r\n  should not have a word to say on the linguistic side: but I claim full\r\n  _parrhesia_ on the literary. The Virtue passage (which Munro specially\r\n  refuses to except) is as rough as, say, Marston; but it has a far\r\n  sincerer, loftier, and more truly poetical tone than anything of the\r\n  kind in Horace, and than most things in Juvenal. And everywhere I see\r\n  quality, passion, _phrase_. Here, at least, I can agree with Cicero\r\n  (_De Orat._, ii. 6 and elsewhere), though _perurbanus_ is not exactly\r\n  the epithet that I should, from his extant writings, myself select for\r\n  Lucilius.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Mr Nettleship is surely justified in calling the\r\nEpistles of the second book “the best of Horace’s critical utterances,”\r\nthough perhaps they are not the most important. Indeed, their eulogist\r\nhastens to add that “it is the incomparable manner of the writer, the\r\nease and sureness of his tread,” which really interests the reader. It\r\nis so; but there is more in criticism than manner, and you must be right\r\nas well as felicitous. Horace is not exactly wrong, but he is\r\nlimited—the Chrysostom of Correctness has acquired better breeding than\r\nhe showed in the Satires, but he has not enlarged his view. The\r\n_horridus Saturnius_ still strikes its own horror into him: he still\r\ngirds at the ancients; and though in the epistle to Julius Florus there\r\nis some pleasant self-raillery, as well as an admirable picture of the\r\nlegitimate poet, yet there is perhaps no piece of Horace which brings\r\nmore clearly home to us the fact that he was after all, as he has been\r\ncalled, far more a critic of life than of literature, and much more\r\nseriously interested in the former than in the latter. So much the\r\nbetter for him perhaps; so much the better for all the ancients who more\r\nor less agreed with him. But that is a matter of argument: the fact\r\nremains.[290]\r\n\r\nFootnote 290:\r\n\r\n  Mr Nettleship justly and, considering his enthusiasm for Horace\r\n  generously contrasts the “comprehensive sympathy” of Ovid (_Am._, i.\r\n  15-19, _Trist._, ii. 423) with the lack of the same quality in the\r\n  Venusian.\r\n\r\nThe third representative selected for Roman criticism of the latest\r\nRepublic and earliest empire, the elder Seneca—\"Seneca Rhetor\"—is again\r\nof a different class and at a different standpoint, though he is very\r\nmuch nearer to Cicero than to Horace.\r\n\r\nThe declamations of antiquity had an influence on its prose style—and\r\nconsequently an effect on its critical opinions of [Sidenote:\r\n“_Declamations._”] style both in verse and prose—which it is almost\r\nimpossible to exaggerate. The practice of them began in boyhood; it\r\nformed almost the greater part of the higher education; and it appears\r\nto have been continued in later life not merely by going to the Schools\r\nto hear novices, but in actual practice, half exercise, half amusement,\r\nby orators and statesmen of the most established fame. It was a sort of\r\nmental fencing-school or gymnasium, to which those who wished to keep\r\ntheir powers in training resorted, even to the close of life. We know\r\nthat Cicero composed, if he did not actually deliver, declamations up to\r\nthe very end of his career; and, in a very different department of\r\nletters, we know from Seneca himself that Ovid, though not a constant,\r\nwas a by no means infrequent, attendant of the schools, and either\r\nacquired or exercised his well-known fancy for turns and plays of words\r\nin prose as well as in verse.\r\n\r\nIn theory, and no doubt to some extent in practice also, these _meletæ_,\r\nor declamations, were permissible and desirable in [Sidenote: _Their\r\nsubjects: epideictic_] all the branches of Rhetoric. But the examples\r\nwhich have come down to us, and the references that we possess to\r\nothers, show us that, as, indeed, we should expect, Epideictic and\r\nDicanic provided the chief subjects. The declamations of the former kind\r\nwere those at which the satirists chiefly laughed—Hannibal crossing the\r\nAlps, Leonidas at Thermopylæ, Whether Cicero could decently have avoided\r\ndeath by making a bargain with Antony, and the like. To this kind of\r\nsubject there could evidently be no limit, and it might sometimes pass,\r\nas in the Orations (which are after all only declamations) of Dion\r\nChrysostom we know that it at least once did pass, into a regular\r\nliterary Essay. But it seems more generally to have affected the\r\nfanciful-historic.\r\n\r\nThe purely forensic declamation had some differences. As its object was\r\nnot merely or mainly, like that of the other, to [Sidenote: _and\r\nforensic._] display cleverness, but to assist the acquisition and\r\ndisplay of ability as a counsel, it fell into certain rather narrow and\r\nnot very numerous grooves. Certain “hard cases,” paradoxes of the law,\r\nseem from very early times to have been excogitated by the ingenuity of\r\nthe rhetoricians, and the game was to treat these—on one side or the\r\nother, or both—with as much force, but above all with as much apparent\r\nnovelty, as the speaker’s wits could manage. A very favourite one was\r\nbased on the venerable practice of allowing the victim of a rape the\r\nchoice of death for her violator or requiring him to marry her, with the\r\n_aporia_, “Suppose a man is guilty of two such crimes, and one girl\r\ndemands death, the other marriage, what is to be done?” Or “Suppose a\r\ngirl, situated like Marina in _Pericles_, but slaying her Lysimachus,\r\nnot converting him. Released from her bondage, she presents herself as\r\ncandidate for a priestess-ship. Is she eligible or not?”[291] The\r\nextremity of perverse fancy in this direction is perhaps reached by a\r\npair of the declamations attributed to Quintilian,[292] in which the\r\nlover of a courtesan brings an action against her for administering a\r\ncounter-philtre, so that he may love her no longer, and she may accept a\r\nwealthier suitor. But there is no limit to the almost diseased\r\nimagination of these Cases. A city[293] is afflicted by famine, and a\r\ncommissioner is sent to buy up grain, with orders to return by a certain\r\nday. He executes his commission successfully and quickly, but being\r\ndriven into port in a third country by bad weather, sells the grain at a\r\nhigh price, buys twice as much elsewhere, and returns by the appointed\r\ntime. But, meanwhile, the famine has grown so severe that the people\r\nhave been driven to cannibalism, which his return direct with his first\r\nbargain would have prevented. Is he guilty or not guilty?\r\n\r\nFootnote 291:\r\n\r\n  Seneca, _Contr._, i. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 292:\r\n\r\n  xiv. and xv. _Ed. cit. inf._ (p. 279 _note_), pp. 154-169.\r\n\r\nFootnote 293:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., xii. The so-called _Pasti Cadaveribus_. _Ed. cit. inf._, p.\r\n  126.\r\n\r\nA very little consideration will show that both these classes of\r\ncomposition must have had great, permanent, and not altogether\r\n[Sidenote: _Their influence on style._] good effects on style. Both\r\ndealt with hackneyed subjects, and in both success was most likely to be\r\nachieved by “peppering higher,” in various ways. The epideictic subjects\r\nsuggested various forms of bombast, conceit, trick, from the use of\r\npoetical, archaic, or otherwise unfamiliar diction to the device of the\r\nmouther of whom Seneca tells us,[294] and who, declaiming on Greeks and\r\nPersians, stood a-tiptoe and cried, “I rejoice! I rejoice!” and only\r\nafter a due pause explained the cause of his rejoicing. The forensic\r\nsubjects tempted the racking of the brain for some new quibble, some\r\nfresh refinement or hair-splitting. Especially was this the case in the\r\nsubdivision of what were called the _colores_—ingenious excuses for the\r\nparties, whence comes the special sense of our word colourable, and\r\nwhereof Seneca makes a special heading, usually at the end of his\r\narticles. No pitch of mental wiredrawing, no extravagance of play on\r\nword or phrase, was too great for some declaimers, of whom a certain\r\nMurredius is Seneca’s favourite Helot. In fact, in both classes,\r\nepideictic and forensic, one can see that a plain, forcible, manly style\r\ncould only be commended by a combination of very unusual genius on the\r\npart of the speaker, and still more unusual taste and receptivity on the\r\npart of the audience. Their _sophos_, their _euge_, their _belle_,[295]\r\nwere much more likely to be evoked by ingenious and far-fetched conceit\r\nthan by solid reasoning and Attic style, which latter, indeed, on such\r\ntrite subjects were nearly impossible.\r\n\r\nFootnote 294:\r\n\r\n  _Suas._, ii. 17. _His_ name, too, was Seneca; and the text is\r\n  curiously worded.\r\n\r\nFor illustration of what has been said, the hodge-podge of Seneca is\r\nmore valuable than the finished declamations of the Pseudo-Quintilian.\r\nThese latter,[296] despite the absurdity, or at any rate the\r\nnon-naturalness, of their subject, are sometimes rather accomplished\r\npieces of writing in a very artificial style. The speech, _Pro Juvene\r\ncontra Meretricem_, referred to above, is, in its whimsical way, a\r\ndecidedly remarkable example of decadent prose. The crime of making some\r\none cease to love is odd in itself; the complaint that you have been\r\ninjured by being made to cease to love odder still. Besides, if you\r\ncomplain of this as an injury, do you not still love, and have you not,\r\ntherefore, nothing to complain of? The topsyturvyfication is, it will be\r\nseen, complete. And the declaimer, whoever he was, treats his subject\r\n_con amore_. The tricks of his thought are infinite, and well suited\r\nwith the artifices of his speech. In particular, every paragraph leads\r\nup to, and winds up with, a sort of variation on one general theme or\r\n_Leitmotiv_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 295:\r\n\r\n  Of these equivalents of “Hear! hear!” or “Bravo!” the second is good\r\n  adopted Latin of all times. The first, well known from Martial, is\r\n  post-Augustan; the third (which Cicero did not much like) seems to\r\n  have been both lukewarm and affected.\r\n\r\nFootnote 296:\r\n\r\n  _V. inf._, p. 279 _sq._\r\n\r\n“To be compelled to hate is the one incurable form of disease.”\r\n\r\n“There is some solace in being miserable in love. 'Tis a more cruel\r\ndestiny to hate a harlot.”\r\n\r\n“He who cannot leave off hating a harlot is still her lover.”\r\n\r\n“The victim of a counter-philtre may hate one: he can love none.”\r\n\r\nThinker and writer, it will be seen, are a sort of pair of bounding\r\nbrothers: they stand on their heads, fling circles, intertwine limbs,\r\ntake every non-natural posture, to the utmost possibility of\r\nintellectual acrobatics.\r\n\r\nThe Seneca book,[297] much more fragmentary, is also of its nature\r\nricher. It consists of one book of “Suasories” (examples [Sidenote:\r\n_Seneca the Elder._] of the symbouleutic or epideictic kind), and ten\r\n(by no means completely extant) of “Controversies” (Forensic subjects),\r\nthe latter sometimes including introductions of interest to the writer’s\r\nthree sons—Novatus, afterwards Gallio, Seneca the Philosopher, and Mela,\r\nfather of the poet Lucan—and usually concluding with a kind of _résumé_\r\n(called Excerpta) of their contents. The substance is made up of short\r\nextracts from the most celebrated declaimers of Rome, and a few Greeks,\r\non the various subjects.\r\n\r\nFootnote 297:\r\n\r\n  I use the text of Kiessling. Leipsic, 1872.\r\n\r\nThey give us a really invaluable abundance, in all kinds, of rhetorical\r\n_loci communes_, tags, _pointes_, with which, from early [Sidenote: _The\r\nSuasories._] and late practice, the mind of every educated man at Rome\r\nwas simply saturated, and which could hardly fail to colour his style,\r\neither directly in the way of imitation, or indirectly in that of\r\nrepulsion, and preference of extreme severity.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the first _Suasoria_ deals with the question, “Shall\r\nAlexander cross the Ocean?” though the exact statement of question is\r\nlost altogether, with the beginning of the piece itself. It seems to\r\nhave opened with a sort of abstract of general commonplaces, and then\r\ncome the quotations. Argentarius [perhaps Marcus the epigrammatist]\r\naddresses the conqueror: “Halt! the world that is thine calls thee back;\r\nwe have conquered as far as it was lawful for us. There is nothing I can\r\nseek at the risk of Alexander.” Oscus said: “It is time for Alexander to\r\nleave off where the sun and the earth leave off likewise,” and\r\nendeavoured to describe the sea, “immense and untried by human\r\nexperience, the bond of all the world and the keeper of its lands, the\r\nvastness unruffled by any oar, the shores, now harried by the raging\r\ntide, now deserted by its ebb, the horrid darkness brooding on the\r\nwaves, and the eternal night oppressing what nature has withdrawn from\r\nhuman eyes.” And so many. Then there is a section (headed _Divisio_), on\r\nthe particular kind of suasion to be used in such speeches, the devices\r\nwhich it is safe and proper for orators to address to kings, with\r\ngradations as before. It will readily be perceived from this example\r\nwhat sort of dealing is here on the other stock subjects—the\r\ndeliberation of the three hundred at Thermopylæ, whether they shall go\r\nor not; of Agamemnon, whether he shall sacrifice Iphigenia; of\r\nAlexander, whether he shall enter Babylon; of the Athenians, whether on\r\nXerxes’ threat of a second invasion they shall remove the Persian war\r\ntrophies; of Cicero, whether he shall ask mercy of Antony, or burn his\r\nPhilippics. The quotations are sometimes verse as well as prose, and\r\ngive us specimens of poets otherwise lost, with an occasional literary\r\nanecdote of interest, such as the offence which Asinius Pollio[298] took\r\nat the praise given to Cicero in the recitation by a certain poet of\r\nCorduba, Sextilius Ena—\r\n\r\n            “Deflendus Cicero est Latiæque silentia linguæ,”\r\n\r\nwhich Cornelius Severus borrowed, and improved into—\r\n\r\n               “Conticuit Latiæ tristis facundia linguæ.”\r\n\r\nThis anecdote is interesting in many ways,—first for the protest of\r\nPollio, almost equally piquant whether it proceeded from critical\r\nseverity, from personal jealousy, or from political feeling; and\r\nsecondly, for the evidence it gives of the straining for point and\r\nrhetorical “hit,” in verse and prose alike.\r\n\r\nFootnote 298:\r\n\r\n  See _Suas._, vi. Pollio, a great friend of Antony, was both an orator\r\n  of high reputation and a very severe critic. It was he, it should be\r\n  remembered, who found “Patavinity” in Livy; though it has been\r\n  ingeniously suggested that this was only an _excessive_ propriety of\r\n  speech, such as enabled the old woman to detect Theophrastus as not an\r\n  Athenian.\r\n\r\nThe Preface of the First Book of the _Controversies_—addressed to the\r\nthree sons—gives a rather interesting view of the scheme [Sidenote:\r\n_The_ Controversies: _their Introductions_.] of these curious\r\ncompositions, which seems to have been that Seneca the father should\r\nbrush up his memory of the golden or nearly golden age of Latin Rhetoric\r\nwhich immediately followed Cicero, and illustrate it from more strictly\r\nliterary sources. A good deal in the piece (as is usual in the better\r\nclass of rhetorical writing) bears directly on our subject. The old\r\nrhetorician commends his sons for extending their view beyond their own\r\nage, for wanting to know what Roman eloquence there was to set against\r\n“insolent Greece”[299]—in short, for endeavouring to take that\r\ncomparative view of at least one division of literature the want of\r\nwhich (as we have so fully set forth) was the crying sin and yet the\r\ninevitable weakness of Greek criticism. He has the usual complaint of\r\nluxury withdrawing men from literature, which was doubtless as true, and\r\nas little peculiar, then as at all other times. He lets us know that\r\nthere were none (or no good) _commentarii_ of the best declaimers, that\r\nhe himself had heard them all except Cicero, whom, as far as chronology\r\nwent, he might have heard,[300] but for the confusions of the state: he\r\npoints out that the regular declamation was a rather late growth, and\r\nextols the character of Porcius Latro, one of its oldest practitioners.\r\nThe Introduction to the Second Book is much shorter, and principally\r\ncelebrates the ability of Arellius Fuscus. The Third (for the text of\r\nwhich we only have the Excerpts, not the full articles) has an important\r\npreface, which starts from the fact or assertion that Cassius Severus, a\r\ngreat orator on serious occasions, was not a good declaimer, though he\r\nhad good bodily advantages, a voice at once powerful and sweet, a\r\ndelivery with all the merits and none of the drawbacks of the stage, and\r\nan extraordinary faculty of improvisation. It seems that Seneca once\r\nasked him why these faculties failed him in set _agonismata_, and his\r\nanswer (whether to the point or not) is of the very first interest, as\r\nillustrating that difficult point of the ancient conjunction of oratory\r\nand literature, and also as a counterblast to the Plinian idea (_v.\r\ninfra_) of the poly-historic _littérateur_. “What great wit,” said he,\r\n“has ever been good at more than one thing [whereby, let it be observed,\r\nhe separates declamation from oratory]? Did not Cicero’s eloquence fail\r\nhim in verse? Virgil’s genius in prose? We read the orations of Sallust\r\nsimply as a compliment to the historian: and the oration of that most\r\neloquent man Plato, which is written for Socrates, is worthy neither of\r\ncounsel nor of client.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 299:\r\n\r\n  _Insolenti Græciæ_ (_op. cit._, p. 59). I hope it may be hardly\r\n  necessary to quote certain lines, “To the memory of my beloved Master,\r\n  William Shakespeare, and what he hath left us.” It is already known to\r\n  students of Ben Jonson that Ben was soaked in Latin, especially of the\r\n  silver age: and Professor Schelling of Philadelphia has done good work\r\n  by indicating sources in his edition of the _Discoveries_. But the\r\n  vein is not exhausted. Seneca and Quintilian were to Ben almost more\r\n  than Browne and Fuller were to Lamb.\r\n\r\nFootnote 300:\r\n\r\n  Seneca was born about 60 B.C., and was thus eighteen at Cicero’s\r\n  death.\r\n\r\nAll these things invite comment—the last most of all. I put aside, as\r\nentirely irrelevant, certain modern dubitations as to the genuineness of\r\nthe Platonic _Apology_. They rest upon no warranty of scripture, and\r\nopinion is simply opinion, to be received politely, and to be “laid on\r\nthe table.” But it is worth dwelling on the point that the _Apology_ as\r\nwe have it, though to all competent judges of literature one of the\r\ncapital works of antiquity, arch-worthy of Plato, more than arch-worthy\r\nof Socrates, might very well seem to a Roman lawyer unworthy of both,\r\nand might possibly have so seemed to Aristotle himself. For of all\r\nrecorded _plaidoyers_ it is perhaps, in the temper of the jury and the\r\ncircumstances of the case, the least likely to secure an acquittal, and\r\nthe most likely to render condemnation inevitable. The other remarks do\r\nnot matter so much; but it is of weight that a man should seriously put\r\nthe difference between Declamation and practical Oratory on the same\r\nfooting as the difference between poetry and prose. It shows how\r\nill-adjusted, as yet, the grasp of literary criticism was, and also how\r\nnecessary it is to keep an eye on everything that is said about\r\nRhetoric, if we are really to master what was thought about Criticism.\r\nThe introduction to the Fourth Book, again one of Excerpts only, gives\r\nthe information that Asinius Pollio (whose works, if we had them, would\r\nprobably be of the greatest possible value to _us_) disliked declaiming\r\nin public, but was, on the rare occasions when he could be heard thus\r\nexercising himself, more florid than in his actual orations. We can well\r\nbelieve it, and it shows that Pollio had the root of the matter in him.\r\nIn the same way a man with critical sense will allow himself, in a rough\r\ndraft, flowers which he cuts out in the most ruthless manner before he\r\nprints.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth and Sixth books, which are in the same fragmentary\r\ncondition, have no introductions at all; but the seventh is in better\r\ncase. Like the others, it is mainly devoted to the characteristics of\r\na single orator—in this case Silius Albucius. Some of the things said\r\nabout him touch us nearly, as, for instance, Pollio’s—the severe\r\nPollio’s—description of his _sentences_ (axioms, maxims, apophthegms)\r\nas “white”—that is to say, simple, clear, with nothing obscure or\r\nunexpected,—but “vocal” and “splendid.” It was impossible, continues\r\nSeneca, to complain of the poverty of the Latin tongue when you heard\r\nhim: he was never in the very least in pain for a word. Yet, on the\r\nother hand, he was not equal. His language was at one moment\r\nmagnificent, at another he would mention the most sordid\r\nthings—\"vinegar, and pennyroyal, and lanterns, and pumice, and\r\nsponges.\" He thought “nothing must _not_ be named in a declamation\r\n[and the reason is valuable or invaluable] because he feared to smack\r\nof the Schools.” And yet further we get the important _obiter dictum_:\r\n“Familiar phrase is, among oratorical virtues, a thing which rarely\r\nsucceeds.” And then there is a very luminous and jocund anecdote of\r\nthe real trouble into which the devotion to Figures might even then\r\nbring men. Albucius had rhetorically proposed to administer certain\r\noaths. His opponent, L. Arruntius, very coolly rose and said, “We\r\naccept the condition: he shall swear.” Albucius protested that this\r\nwould do away with Figures altogether. Quoth Arruntius (very\r\nsensibly), “Let them go—we can do without them”: and the _centumviri_\r\nallowed the catch. The unlucky orator was so annoyed that he renounced\r\nactual pleading from that day, because of the insult done to his\r\nbeloved Figures.\r\n\r\nThe Eighth Book is again without its preface; but though there is a very\r\nlarge lacuna in ix., we have part of the introduction. It yields little.\r\nThe last is in better case, but still not very fertile, though we have\r\nanother instance of the mania for Figures. It is said of the\r\nabove-quoted Oscus: “Dum nihil non schemate dicere cupit, oratio ejus\r\nnon figurata erat sed prava.” Certainly there are no few examples of\r\nthis “pravity” in the declamations themselves, which it would be\r\ninteresting, but in our space impossible, to examine, as we have\r\nexamined the prefaces.[301]\r\n\r\nFootnote 301:\r\n\r\n  It has always to be remembered that they are not integral and\r\n  complete, but centos of quoted flights, conceits, &c., on the stock\r\n  hard cases.\r\n\r\nThey, however, also contain examples of that severity of taste which has\r\nalways distinguished Latin criticism, and of which Pollio is the great\r\nexample. Messala, as we learn, was _Latini utique sermonis observator\r\ndiligentissimus_, and he said of Latro (whom Seneca’s later taste\r\nadmired) “_sua_ lingua disertus est”—\"He is an eloquent man in his own\r\nlingo.\" Seneca himself, however, is by no means tolerant of excessive\r\nconceit, and rebukes the class of “sentence” which, he tells us, some\r\ncharged upon Publilius as inventor. The examples given are in the case\r\nof a disinherited son found with poison, which he spills on discovery in\r\nthe interior of his father’s house: and the sentences are, “He washed\r\nout his disinheriting with poison, and what he spilt was my death,” both\r\nbeing supposed to be spoken by the father. And in another stock case—the\r\ncurious one which has more than one historical analogue, where the\r\nPrætor Flamininus was accused of having had a condemned man’s throat cut\r\nat dinner, to amuse a courtesan who said she had never seen a man\r\ndie—the unlucky Murredius is said to have arranged a _tetracolon_—a\r\nfour-membered antithesis: “The courts are made subservient to the\r\nbed-chamber; the prætor to a harlot; the prison to the banquet; day to\r\nnight”; as to which last Seneca justly asks, “What sense has it?”\r\n\r\nOn the whole, this very valuable and interesting book, which has been\r\nspoken of with surprisingly uncritical contempt by some, and to which I\r\nshould like to devote much greater space, forms, with Pliny’s _Letters_\r\nand Quintilian, the great trinity of documents for appreciating directly\r\nthe state of Latin opinion as to literature, and its causes, in the\r\nfirst century after Christ, while with Cicero and Horace it forms a\r\nsimilar trinity for that in the last century before Christ. And it is\r\nneedless to say that these two periods were, early _avant-coureurs_ and\r\nbelated decadents excepted, the flourishing time of classical Latin\r\nliterature. Of this state and these causes we shall speak generally\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nOne writer of famous memory who belongs to this period—who [Sidenote:\r\n_Varro._] indeed was older even than Cicero—has been hitherto\r\nunmentioned, because, as a matter of fact, we have practically no\r\nliterary criticism remaining from him, and that is Varro. I should\r\nmyself have been disposed to relegate the author of the _De Re Rustica_\r\nand the _De Lingua Latina_ to the place of his brother (or grandson)\r\ngrammarians; but this might seem unceremonious in face of the importance\r\nof the critical position which Professor Nettleship assigned to him. It\r\nis, perhaps, also a convenient place to notice the exact character of\r\nthat importance. As in so many other cases, if we went by titles only,\r\nand by guesswork from them, Varro must certainly have a high rank. “On\r\nPoets,” “On Poems,” “On Characters” (in the technical Greek sense of\r\nliterary _differentia_?), “On Scenic Action,” “Plautine Questions,”\r\nmight seem at first sight likely to be, if we had them, a very El Dorado\r\nof Latin criticism. But the few surviving fragments are a little\r\ndiscouraging. That Varro would be fertile in grammatical, mythological,\r\nsocial explanation, we may be quite certain. But the fragments seldom go\r\nmuch farther. The report, quoted by Quintilian, of Ælius Stilo’s saying\r\nthat if the Muses wrote Latin they would write in the language of\r\nPlautus, is one of those rather irritating critical catchwords which\r\ncarry with them the minimum of critical illumination. It is, in fact,\r\nonly an _ad captandum_ fashion of saying that the speaker liked Plautus,\r\nor wanted to pay him a compliment at the moment. Most of the others seem\r\n(as indeed Mr Nettleship saw) to be merely examples, either of the\r\nhabits of “placing” authors in this or that rank, of comparing them with\r\nthis or that other, from which criticism has suffered many things and\r\ngained few, or else of the not much less barren classification of kinds.\r\n\r\nIt is on the first point that I wish to make a slight digression. It is\r\nevident from the epithets that he uses in regard to them, such as\r\n“stupid,” “trifling,” “vicious,” that these processes of placing and of\r\ncomparison were not to Mr Nettleship’s taste. I shall myself admit that\r\nthe addiction of Greek, and still more of Latin, criticism to them seems\r\nto me to be among the very greatest weaknesses of both. But I must add a\r\ndistinction which is constantly forgotten, and which I am not sure that\r\nMr Nettleship himself had in mind. The “placing” of A, B, C, and D in\r\norder of merit is “stupid” and “trifling” enough; the still further\r\nawarding of seventh place to A for Somethingity, and of third to B for\r\nSomethingelseness, is more stupid and more trivial still. Nor is that\r\ncomparative criticism, the _locus classicus_ of which is perhaps M.\r\nTaine’s ejaculation, “J’aime mieux Alfred de Musset,” as a criticism on\r\nTennyson, any better; in fact, as being not merely sterile and jejune,\r\nbut illogical and actively misleading, it is considerably worse. But\r\nthere _is_ a placing and there _is_ a comparison, which are two very\r\ndifferent things—which are, in fact, the two highways of all real\r\nliterary criticism. The placing is that which sets a man, not in the\r\nfirst division of the first class, or the second of the third, but in\r\nhis relations to time and country, to language and manner, to\r\npredecessors and successors—to the whole literary map in larger or\r\nsmaller circumference. The comparison is that which does not work out a\r\nperformer’s rank, but disengages his qualities. These are the methods to\r\nwhich all the great critics have perforce resorted, and which have made\r\nthem great. That there is less of them than there should be in ancient\r\ncriticism may be true enough; that the want of them (with perhaps a\r\nlittle want also of sympathy with the highest poetry) is what prevents\r\nAristotle from being the greatest critic of all time, is true enough;\r\nthat the presence of them in Longinus is one of the main secrets of his\r\nunmatched quality, is true enough. But they are very different things\r\nfrom the enumeration of Volcatius Sedigitus, and from the _in argumentis\r\nCæcilius in ethesin Terentius in sermonibus Plautus_ of Varro.[302]\r\n\r\nFootnote 302:\r\n\r\n  Varro was happier in the phrase _filo et facetia sermonis_ applied to\r\n  Plautus: and he seems to have been genuinely devoted to the dramatist\r\n  whose canon he constituted, _v._ _Noctes Atticæ_, III. iii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                   THE CONTEMPORARIES OF QUINTILIAN.\r\n\r\nPETRONIUS—SENECA THE YOUNGER—THE SATIRISTS—PERSIUS—THE PROLOGUE AND\r\n    FIRST SATIRE—EXAMINATION OF THIS—JUVENAL—MARTIAL—THE STYLE OF THE\r\n    EPIGRAMS—PRÉCIS OF THEIR CRITICAL CONTENTS—STATIUS—PLINY THE\r\n    YOUNGER—CRITICISM IN THE ‘LETTERS’—THE ‘DIALOGUS DE CLARIS\r\n    ORATORIBUS’—MR NETTLESHIP’S ESTIMATE OF IT—THE GENERAL LITERARY\r\n    TASTE OF THE SILVER AGE—“FAULTLESSNESS”—ORNATE OR PLAIN STYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the later years of Augustus, and the earlier of his immediate\r\nsuccessors, we have no criticism of importance [Sidenote: _Petronius._]\r\nexcept Seneca’s. But the Neronian time has left us interesting\r\napproaches to the subject in the works of Petronius and Seneca the\r\nyounger, as well as in the poet Persius; while, somewhat later, the\r\nsatires of Juvenal and the epigrams of Martial are, the former not\r\ndestitute, the latter full, of literary allusion and opinion. These,\r\nwith a certain contribution from Pliny’s _Letters_ and the _Dialogus de\r\nClaris Oratoribus_ (usually included among the works of Tacitus, but not\r\nresembling him in style, and sometimes attributed to Quintilian), must\r\nbe successively dealt with. Quintilian himself is of too great\r\nimportance not to deserve a separate chapter.\r\n\r\nWe can understand, as well from the character usually given of the\r\n_Arbiter elegantiarum_ as from the style of his curiously dismembered\r\nand rather disreputable written work,[303] that questions of literary\r\ncriticism must have been of the first interest to him. If we had the\r\nentire _Satires_ (supposing that they ever were more entire than\r\n_Tristram Shandy_ or the _Moyen de Parvenir_), there can be very little\r\ndoubt that this element would show itself in very large proportion.\r\nThere must have been suppers less brutally vulgar and Philistine than\r\nthat of Trimalchio; and literary discussion was as indispensable at a\r\nRoman supper of the better class as broiled bones at an English\r\none—while suppers lasted. Even the Circes, if not the Quartillas, of the\r\ntime were very frequently “blue” in the intervals of more exciting\r\namusements, and Agamemnon, Eumolpus,[304] and others must have\r\nfrequently spoken in character. As it is, the opening of the fragment as\r\nwe have it, and a passage farther on, deal directly with the subject.\r\n\r\nFootnote 303:\r\n\r\n  I use the smaller edition of Bücheler, Berlin, 1862.\r\n\r\nFootnote 304:\r\n\r\n  There is a theory that the verses put in the mouth of Eumolpus are\r\n  parodies of Lucan and Seneca.\r\n\r\nThe opening passage is occupied with that denunciation of bombastic and\r\n“precious” language which seems to have been the favourite occupation of\r\nthe critics of the time. The attack is at first directed against the\r\npractice of declamation, which almost inevitably tempted boys and\r\nyouthful writers to bombast, but it so quickly glides into a general\r\nliterary censure that it is worth giving in full.\r\n\r\n“I believe that the reason why schoolboys and students become such fools\r\nis, that they never see or hear of anything to which we are accustomed\r\nin the actual world. They are occupied by pirates standing on the beach\r\nwith chains in their hands, by tyrants ordaining that sons shall cut\r\ntheir fathers’ heads off, by oracles against a pestilence to the effect\r\nthat three or more virgins are to be sacrificed, by little bundles of\r\nwords smeared with honey, and everything, as it were, powdered with\r\npoppy-seed and sesamum. For people bred in this fashion sense is as\r\nimpossible as a pleasant odour for those who live in the kitchen.[305]\r\nIf you will excuse my saying so, you rhetoricians were the first to ruin\r\nliterature. By exciting ridicule of [_or_ playing tricks with] your\r\nlight and empty phrases,[306] you weakened and prostrated the whole body\r\nof oratory. Youth had not yet been enslaved to declamations when\r\nSophocles and Euripides devised the words in which they were to speak.\r\nThe private schoolmaster[307] had not spoilt good wits when Pindar and\r\nthe Nine Lyrists feared to sing in Homeric verse. And not to allege\r\npoets only, I certainly find it nowhere said that Plato and Demosthenes\r\nbetook themselves to this kind of eloquence. Oratory full grown, and, if\r\nI may say so, in her maidenhood, is not spotted and swelling [like a\r\ntoad], but shoots up in natural beauty.\r\n\r\nFootnote 305:\r\n\r\n  Or “good taste is as impossible as good smell to those,” &c. I have\r\n  not hit on any satisfactory English equivalents for _sapere_ (with its\r\n  double sense) and _bene olere_. What is meant, of course, is that the\r\n  power of distinguishing is lost in the vicious atmosphere.\r\n\r\nFootnote 306:\r\n\r\n  _Ludibria quædam excitando._\r\n\r\nFootnote 307:\r\n\r\n  _Umbraticus doctor_, which Ben Jonson Englishes directly as\r\n  “umbratical doctors” in the _Discoveries_, and De Quincey rather\r\n  hardily converts to a compliment in his _Essay on Rhetoric_.\r\n\r\n“Of late this windy and extravagant loquacity has shifted from Asia to\r\nAthens, and has breathed upon the aspiring minds of youth like a\r\npestilential star, and forthwith true eloquence, its rule corrupted, has\r\nbeen arrested, and put to silence. Tell me, who has since equalled the\r\nfame of Thucydides, of Hyperides? Not so much as a lyric of wholesome\r\ncomplexion has appeared, and everything, as if poisoned with the same\r\nfood, has been unable to last to a natural grey old age. Even painting\r\nhas made no better end, since the audacity of the Egyptians has cut so\r\ngreat an art down to shorthand.”\r\n\r\nThe rhetorician Agamemnon defends scholastic procedure by the old plan\r\nof throwing the blame on parents and the like; but the story quickly\r\nturns to one of its more than “picaresque” episodes, and the subject\r\ndrops.\r\n\r\nThe other passage[308] begins with equal abruptness, and serves as\r\npreface only to a very much longer poetical recitation by Eumolpus, who\r\nspeaks it. It is chiefly noteworthy for containing the phrase _Curiosa\r\nfelicitas_, applied to Horace, which perhaps itself gives us as good a\r\nnotion of Petronius’ critical faculty as anything could. But it conveys\r\nsome sound doctrine. Verse itself seems easy; any boy thinks he can\r\nwrite it as soon as he has learnt the rules, and retired orators (a hit,\r\nI suppose, at Cicero) compose it as a relaxation, as if it were easier\r\nthan their speeches. But it is no such light matter. You must take\r\nchoice words [we are almost at Dante’s “sifted” words], words far from\r\nthe use of the vulgar crowd,[309] and at the same time you must be\r\ncareful that individual phrases are not too fine for the rest. Nor must\r\nyou treat your subject—civil war, for instance—in the mere tone of a\r\nchronicler, but the “free spirit must be forced through[310]\r\ndifficulties, and the ministry of the gods, and a fabulous torment of\r\nsentences, so that it may rather appear the vaticination of a frenzied\r\nmind than a trustworthy and scrupulous document under attestation.” Now\r\nthis advice, though much in it is sound, takes distinctly the other side\r\nto that which Encolpius had urged in the overture.\r\n\r\nFootnote 308:\r\n\r\n  § 118. Ed. cit., p. 71.\r\n\r\nFootnote 309:\r\n\r\n  _Refugiendum est ab omni verborum ut ita dicam vilitate, et sumendæ\r\n  voces a plebe summotæ._\r\n\r\nFootnote 310:\r\n\r\n  _Præcipitandus est liber spiritus._ A characteristic Petronian phrase\r\n  which will serve (and has in part been used) as text for very\r\n  different sermons. Part of what follows is no doubt intentionally\r\n  obscure. The _ambages deorumque ministeria_ refer, of course, to the\r\n  stock revolutions and interventions of Epic as of Tragedy. But\r\n  _fabulosum sententiarum tormentum_ is not such plain sailing. I\r\n  _think_ it means (with an intentional side-glance at the fabled\r\n  torments which the heroes of Epic see in Hades) the process of racking\r\n  the brain for story-ornament and sententious conceit of phrase.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we must regret very keenly that we have not more of the\r\nArbiter’s remarks on the subject. It is improbable that anything like a\r\ncoherent theory of criticism on the great scale would have emerged, and\r\nvery likely that (as in the two extant examples just quoted) we should\r\nrather have had ingenious centos of opposing views. But all would have\r\nbeen originally and brightly put, and it is by no means impossible that\r\nwhat we now chiefly desiderate—_aperçus_ of particular authors, books,\r\nor passages, done with grasp and insight—would have been forthcoming. As\r\nit is, we have but what we have.\r\n\r\nNero’s other victim, the curious compound between Polonius and Mr\r\nPecksniff (with, it must be owned, some merits which [Sidenote: _Seneca\r\nthe Younger._] belonged to neither), whose name was L. Annæus Seneca,\r\nhas left us a great deal more work than Petronius, and was certainly a\r\nman of letters. He was even a considerable man of letters, and if he\r\nwrote the _Tragedies_, a very considerable man of letters indeed.[311]\r\nHe had, moreover, though scarcely a good, a distinct and by no means\r\ncommonplace style, and while Quintilian attacks him _nominatim_ in a\r\npassage which will occupy us later, it is by no means improbable that\r\nPetronius (who must have known him well, and was probably bored by him)\r\nhad Seneca himself in his mind when he talked of the _ventosa et enormis\r\nloquacitas_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 311:\r\n\r\n  _Works_, 3 vols., ed. Haase, Leipsic, 1886-87. This does not contain\r\n  the _Tragedies_, as to which, however, I have never wished to go\r\n  beyond a nearly forty years’ possession, the pretty little “Regent’s\r\n  Classics” edition of 1823. But I have never, as a critic, been able to\r\n  believe that Seneca wrote them.\r\n\r\nSeneca, however, was by profession a Stoic, and these classical\r\nPharisees, though their sect was not exactly unliterary, pushed to an\r\nextreme the partly superfine, partly puritanic, contempt with which, as\r\nwe have seen, the philosophy of antiquity generally chose to regard the\r\nminutiæ of literary criticism and literary craft. The “wise man of the\r\nStoics” might be a perfect man of letters, as he was a perfect\r\neverything else; but it was entirely beneath him to take seriously such\r\nthings as metre, or style, or the pleasure of literary art. In the Tenth\r\nDialogue, _de Brevitate Vitæ_,[312] after the philosopher has been\r\ntalking in his high-sniffing way of collecting brasses, singing, giving\r\nlong and _recherché_ dinners (but not, so far as I remember, of putting\r\nout money at usury), he begins a new chapter with things to be treated\r\nmore contemptuously still.\r\n\r\nFootnote 312:\r\n\r\n  Ed. cit., i. 209. If Seneca be suspected of possible insincerity,\r\n  Marcus Aurelius cannot be. Yet the estimable Emperor, who had earlier\r\n  (i. 7), in the true Pharisaic spirit, congratulated himself on\r\n  abstaining from “rhetoric and poetry,” concludes his reference to the\r\n  drama (xi. 6) (a reference interesting as including one of the\r\n  explanations of κάθαρσις), by asking, “To what end does the whole plan\r\n  of poetry and drama look?” As for Epictetus, _v. supra_, p. 62.\r\n\r\n“’Twould be long,” he says, “to track them all out—those whose life\r\ndraughts, or ball-playing, or the practice of carefully cooking their\r\nflesh in the sun, has caused to waste away. They are not exactly lazy\r\npeople, since their pleasures give them a great deal of trouble. For\r\nnobody can doubt that they make much ado about nothing, who are detained\r\nby the study of useless letters—there is a considerable company of them\r\namong us Romans. It has been a mania of the Greeks to inquire how many\r\nrowers Ulysses had, whether the _Iliad_ was written earlier than the\r\n_Odyssey_, further, whether the two are by the same author, and other\r\nmatters of the same stamp, which, if you keep to yourself, they will not\r\nhelp your silent conscience, while, if you talk about them, you will\r\nseem not more learned but only more of a bore.”\r\n\r\nThe rest of the chapter draws up a long list of similar enormities of\r\ncuriosity—historical and literary. “Who had the first naval triumph?”\r\n&c. Seneca even ironically supplies questions of the kind, and\r\ninformation about them, to those who like such things. Elsewhere in the\r\n88th (the third of the thirteenth book)[313] of those not disagreeable\r\nepistles which he composed for the edification of a man of straw called\r\nLucilius, and for the display of his own ability, he supposes the\r\ndefinite question to be put to him, “What do you think of liberal\r\nstudies?” and he goes off at score in the true style of the Stoic\r\npulpit. He respects none, counts none as good. They are all very well as\r\nexercises, as preparations; you may stick to them as long as you can do\r\nnothing better. They are called “liberal,” as worthy of a free man: but\r\nthere is only one study worthy of a freeman (does one not hear the very\r\ndrone of the ancestor of Mr Chadband?), and that is the study of WISDOM.\r\nAll else is petty and puerile: it has nothing to do with making a GOOD\r\nman. Will the grammarian, who, if he does not stick to mere philology,\r\ngoes to history or, at farthest, to poetry, be a road-maker for us to\r\nVIRTUE, my brethren? Will syntax and prosody banish fear, quench\r\ncupidity, bridle lust? And so forth. He makes, indeed, not bad fun of\r\nthe attempts to make out Homer now a Stoic, now an Epicurean, now a\r\nPeripatetic. But he soon relapses into the “chaff and draff” of the\r\nconventional moralists at all times. What are the tempests that impelled\r\nUlysses to the storms of the mind? What does it matter whether Penelope\r\nwas chaste? Teach me what Chastity _is_. _Et patati et patata._ From a\r\nman in this frame of mind comes no good critical thing; though we\r\ncertainly should like to have heard from the Tragedian, whoever he was,\r\nwhat put into his head the idea of that remarkable compromise between\r\nClassic and Romantic Tragedy which gave us the Latin _Hippolytus_ and\r\nthe _Octavia_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 313:\r\n\r\n  Ed. cit., iii. 246 _sq._\r\n\r\nThe three satiric poets give us both directly and indirectly a great\r\ndeal of matter; in fact, they may almost be said to provide the\r\nillustrative commentary to their contemporary and friend[314]\r\nQuintilian’s precepts. It is possible that [Sidenote: _The satirists._]\r\nthe example of Horace may have had something to do with this; but such\r\nan example need not have been required. As we know, not merely from\r\nthemselves, the first century at Rome, if not one of the very greatest\r\ntimes of literary production, was one of very great and very widespread\r\nliterary interest. As Persius tells us—\r\n\r\n                          “Ecce inter pocula quærunt\r\n              Romulidæ saturi, quid dia poemata narrent;”\r\n\r\nwhile Seneca’s remarks, take them with what grains of salt we will, are\r\nsound corroborative evidence. Further, it appears on all hands, not\r\nmerely that there was a distinct fashion of literature, but that this\r\nfashion had its own distinct characteristics, that it was one of the\r\ntimes of ornate as opposed to plain style in verse and prose alike, a\r\ntime of “preciousness,” of “raising the language to a higher power,” a\r\ntime when men openly called Cicero a commonplace and obvious writer,\r\nand, if they did not fail to pay a kind of conventional reverence to\r\nVirgil, wrote in a way as far as possible from being Virgilian. This\r\nalways gives plenty of handles to the poetical satirist, and, as we\r\nshall see, all the three availed themselves of these handles to the\r\nfull.\r\n\r\nFootnote 314:\r\n\r\n  In two cases at least. And Quintilian might have known Persius, as he\r\n  was in Rome before 59 A.D., while Persius did not die till 62.\r\n\r\nThe scanty and notable work of Persius—work which, in the junction of\r\nthese two qualities, has hardly a parallel in literary [Sidenote:\r\n_Persius._] history, except that of Collins in English—is soaked in\r\ncriticism of literature as well as of life. The poet’s turbid rush of\r\nthought and style, forcing its way through self-created obstacles but\r\nstill forcing it, thick with suspended matter, but all the richer\r\ntherefor, allows him not merely to deal directly with this subject, but\r\nin dealing with others to make constant allusion and by-blow. The famous\r\n[Sidenote: _The Prologue and First Satire._] scazontic prologue, with\r\nits affected language, satirising affectation, and its conceits, giving\r\nan object-lesson of conceited style, is all literary except the moral,\r\n_quoad_ “Master Gaster, first Master of Arts,” as Rabelais refashioned\r\nit fifteen hundred years later. The “horsy fountain” and the sleep on\r\n“two-headed” Parnassus, the relinquishment of the Muses to those whom\r\nsuch ladies concern, and the final fling about the crow-poets and\r\npoetess-magpies, may be gibes at dabblers in literature: but they show\r\nthat the giber is steeped in literature himself, and has taken a\r\ncritical as well as a delighted bath therein. And the first satire (the\r\nlongest but one) is wholly and directly devoted to the subject. With the\r\nold device of a cool objecting friend, Persius takes occasion, while\r\ndeclaring (also an old trick) his own honest desire to keep to better\r\nmatters, to draw a lively picture of the professional poet, or\r\ndeclamation-writer, scribbling in his locked study, arraying himself in\r\nhis best clothes, and even with such jewelry as he can muster, carefully\r\ngargling his throat, and then tickling the ears of his audience, and\r\ncomforting himself, when anybody objects the worthlessness of such\r\napplause, by the plea—\r\n\r\n        “At pulchrum digito monstrari et dicier ‘Hic est!’”[315]\r\n\r\nA still livelier picture follows of the symposium referred to in the\r\nlines above quoted as to _Romulidæ saturi_; of the literary dandy in\r\nhyacinthine garment mincing and twanging through his nose some morbid\r\nstuff (_rancidulum quiddam_) about Phyllis and Hypsipyle, and being\r\ncheered in a fashion fit to make the poet’s ashes happy, his slab lie\r\nlighter on his tomb, and violets spring therefrom.\r\n\r\nFootnote 315:\r\n\r\n  Not a few other phrases, such as—\r\n\r\n                       “Cum carmina lumbum\r\n            Intrant, et tremulo scalpuntur ubi intima versu”—\r\n\r\n  show what a formidable, and what an accurate and capable, reviewer, of\r\n  the slashing order, Persius would have made.\r\n\r\nThen he draws in his horns a little. Verse, of course, is not\r\nnecessarily bad because it is popular only. But _Euge!_ and _Belle!_ are\r\nnot the be-all and end-all of literature. What wretched stuff has not\r\nreceived them? How often have they not been consideration for a good\r\ndinner, and a cloak just a little torn! And what is even genuine popular\r\njudgment worth? Why do not poets adopt honest Roman subjects, instead of\r\nchattering about unreal Hellenics? And why do they affect such\r\nantiquated and unnatural style? What is the good of borrowing such stuff\r\nas\r\n\r\n                   “Ærumnis cor luctificabile fulta,”\r\n\r\nof ranging everything _in doctis figuris_, and of writing passages, such\r\nas two famous ones which he quotes, and which are traditionally asserted\r\nto be the work of Nero himself. He exhausts his images of scorn on these\r\nunlucky lines, and holds up _Arma virum_ against them as an example of\r\nnatural knotty strength against effeminate drivel. And to a fresh\r\nprotest of his friends about the danger of this kind of criticism, he\r\nreplies by an ironical consent to declare it all very good, and a _coda_\r\nof regret for the time when Lucilius used what freedom of speech he\r\nchose, when Horace laughed at everybody without giving offence, more\r\nseriously declaring that, whether he can publish or not, he will _write_\r\nas the giants of the Old Comedy wrote.\r\n\r\nIn this lively crabbed production there are two distinct strains or\r\nbents to note. All the best critics have for some time admitted that in\r\nprofessed satire generally, and in Roman satire more than in any other,\r\nthere is, if not a touch of cant, at any rate a distinct convention of\r\nmoral indignation—a sort of stock-part of bluff, honestly old-fashioned,\r\ncensuring of modern corruption—which the satirist takes up as a matter\r\nof business. Even Martial, upon whom, Heaven knows! it sits oddly\r\nenough, though his consummate dexterity carries it off not ill, affects\r\nthis now and then; it sometimes suggests itself even through the gloomy\r\nintensity of Juvenal; and though such a line as Persius’ famous\r\n\r\n               “Virtutem videant intabescantque relicta”\r\n\r\ncarries us far out of the dissenting-pulpiteer region where Seneca too\r\noften gesticulates, there is in this First Satire, at any rate, some\r\nsuspicion of forced wrath, of the righteous overmuch.\r\n\r\nBut the other strand in the twist, the other glance of the view, is in a\r\nvery different state. There is nothing unreal, to all appearance, in the\r\npoet’s condemnation of the preciousness [Sidenote: _Examination of\r\nthis._] and conceit of poetic and prose style in his day. That his own\r\nis very far from simple or Attic does not matter; the satire had a\r\nprescriptive right to be crabbed, archaic, irregular, bizarre. Whether\r\npolitical dislike of the tyrant did not sharpen literary objection to\r\nthe poetaster (if the lines really are Nero’s) may be a debatable\r\nquestion for those who care to debate it; but, in any case, the\r\nobjection was there, and seems to have been quite genuine. Now, as has\r\nbeen often pointed out, these definite passages, definitely objected to\r\nor praised, are precisely what we want most, and have least of, in\r\nancient criticism. A short examination of them, therefore, will serve\r\nour turn very well.\r\n\r\nThe first passage appears to be cited chiefly as an objectionable\r\nexample of archaism. We shall see that Quintilian (perhaps in obedience\r\nto this very passage, for he knew his Persius, and admired him) repeats\r\nthe objection to the word _ærumna_[316]—to us a word not in the least\r\nobjectionable, but the contrary. And if it be said that foreigners, and\r\nespecially foreigners who acknowledge themselves entirely uncertain\r\nabout the probable pronunciation of Latin, have no business to give an\r\nopinion about the euphony of words, the retort is obvious and pretty\r\ntriumphant. To _some_ Romans, at any rate, if not to Persius and\r\nQuintilian, the word must have sounded agreeable, or as poets they would\r\nnot have used, and as hearers or readers would not have applauded, it.\r\nThe conceit of “cor _fulta_ ærumnis”—with heart stretched on pillows of\r\nwoes—was no doubt another crime, and it is not improbable that\r\n_luctificabile_ was a third. The Romans had a rather pedantic horror of\r\nlong words, which is again formulated by Quintilian, just as it is\r\nimplied and exemplified here.\r\n\r\nFootnote 316:\r\n\r\n  It has been questioned whether Persius did object to _ærumna_, or to\r\n  any of these words, _as words_. I should say that the coincidence in\r\n  Quintilian settles the first point: even if the context did not, to my\r\n  thinking, settle it, with the others. But he _may_ have been thinking\r\n  merely or mainly of the confusion of tragic and epic style.\r\n\r\nOf the same type and colour is the objection to _rasa antitheta_ and\r\n_doctæ figuræ_ which follows, as well as that to the vowel harmony, the\r\nsoft cadence, the mouth-watering[317] tenderness of the Neronian\r\nfragments. We may, without rashness, point to the soft sound of\r\n“Berecynthius Attin,” the alliteration of “_di_rimebat” and “_Del_phin”\r\nwith the internal half-rhyme of “_cær_uleum” and “_Ner_ea,” the leonine\r\neffect of “long_o_” and “Apennin_o_” and the two tetrasyllables, with\r\nthe sudden pull up of the spondaic ending, as what irritated Persius.\r\nThis same accompaniment of sound, and cunning contrast or echo of\r\nvowels, recurs in the second and more coherent extract: “_Tor_va,\r\n_cor_nua”; “Mimal_lon_eis _bom_bis,” “_rap_tum _cap_ut”; “vitul_o_\r\nsuperb_o_”; “_lyn_cem co_rym_bis”; the long words “reparabilis” and\r\n“Mimalloneis,” with the foreign effect of the latter and others. These,\r\nno doubt, were the things which annoyed our poet here.\r\n\r\nFootnote 317:\r\n\r\n  _Tenerum et laxa cervice legendum ... delumbe ... natat in labris ...\r\n  in udo est._\r\n\r\nA little reflection will make this annoyance exceedingly interesting.\r\nNot merely is the general effect of these lines very similar to that of\r\nhundreds and thousands of lines, in the earlier English Romantic school\r\nfrom Marlowe to Chamberlayne, in the later from Keats to Mr Swinburne;\r\nbut the indignation of Persius is exactly similar, if not to the almost\r\nincredulous and disgusted disdain with which the critics and poets of\r\nthe “school of good sense” looked back on the vagaries of their\r\npredecessors, to the alarmed and furious attempt made by critics of the\r\npresent century to extinguish contemporaries who indulged in such\r\nthings. Persius on Nero, if Nero it was, no doubt gave hints to, and,\r\nwith hardly less doubt, was himself quite in sympathy with, the\r\n_Quarterly_ Reviewers of Keats and Tennyson. There is the same protest\r\nagainst the effeminate, the luscious, the unrestrained, the same\r\nindignant demand for manliness, order, sanity.\r\n\r\nBut we may go even further. These same processes, which we have ventured\r\nto point out as certainly illustrated by the gibbeted verses, and as\r\nprobably accounting for the wrath of their executioner, are the very\r\nprocesses by which all our great nineteenth-century poets in English\r\nhave produced their characteristic effects—alliteration, internal rhyme\r\nor assonance, complete or muffled, and, above all, the modulation of\r\nvowel and consonant so as to produce a sort of song without music,\r\naccompanying the actual words. And it may be noted that while some of\r\nour modern critics have objected to these things in themselves, many\r\nmore, oddly enough, object to the process of pointing them out, and seem\r\nto think that there is something almost indecent in it.\r\n\r\nIt would be unreasonable to expect that in the narrow compass of some\r\nsix hundred lines this passage—_locus uberrimus fructuosissimusque_, to\r\nborrow the Ciceronian superlatives—should repeat itself. But the\r\nliterary interest of Persius, as regards criticism, is by no means\r\nexhausted. The next three satires are indeed wholly occupied by the\r\nexposition of that practical, honest, upright, rather hard, rather\r\nlimited morality which it is the pride of Rome to have carried as far as\r\nmere morality of the sort can travel. But the beginnings of the\r\nfifth[318] and sixth[319] have a literary and critical turn in them, and\r\nthough the course of the satire is afterwards deflected, these\r\nbeginnings show the same man, the same tastes, the same standards that\r\nwe have seen in the first. Don’t potter over fantastic subjects and sham\r\nGreek epics, but attack something Roman and serious. Whatever you write,\r\nwrite it in a manly fashion, with no æsthetic trifling. That is the\r\ncritical gospel of Persius, and he sets it forth with a vigour which we\r\nshall seldom find equalled, and with (in the instance we have dwelt\r\nupon) a most fortunate fertility of illustration.\r\n\r\nFootnote 318:\r\n\r\n  _Vatibus hic mos est_, κ.τ.λ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 319:\r\n\r\n  With its compliment to Cæsius Bassus and his _marem strepitum fidis\r\n  Latinæ_.\r\n\r\nThe far bulkier work of Juvenal—work also of far higher genius in parts,\r\nbut more unequal and uncertain—contains less [Sidenote: _Juvenal._] that\r\nconcerns our subject. It is impossible to mistake in Persius, young as\r\nhe died, and scanty as are his remains, a very direct interest in\r\nliterary form, such as did not always or often accompany Stoic\r\nphilosophy. Juvenal, with a less definite philosophical creed, and\r\nperhaps a rather lower moral standard, had a higher “Pisgah-sight” and a\r\nstronger grasp of life as a whole. However long Persius had lived, it is\r\nimprobable that he would ever have given us anything equal to the\r\nmagnificent Tenth Satire. But Juvenal, much more of a pessimist than\r\nPersius, was less capable of enthusiasm. His general critical standpoint\r\ndoes not seem to have been very different from that of his predecessor,\r\nor indeed (allowing for the vastly greater difference of temperament)\r\nfrom that which we shall find in Martial. But to Juvenal literature as\r\nliterature had no special pre-eminence among the contents of his famous\r\n_farrago_. It would even appear that, although practising it greatly\r\nhimself, he had a rather special contempt for it.[320] The well-known\r\nopening of the First Satire[321] agrees with Persius and with Martial in\r\nits scorn of artificial Greek epics, of sham heroic subjects and forms\r\ngenerally. But there pierces through it something of a special contempt\r\nfor “Grub Street”—for the unlucky “Codrus”—who reappears, not always to\r\nbe abused, but always to be dismissed with a sort of kick of contempt.\r\nThere is something more than the stock superciliousness of the satirist\r\nin the thousand times quoted\r\n\r\n                    “Stulta est clementia, cum tot ubique\r\n              Vatibus occurras, perituræ parcere chartæ.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 320:\r\n\r\n  It has been held that Juvenal shows his “freedman” extraction by aping\r\n  and overdoing patrician prejudice in this and other matters. But I had\r\n  rather not think this.\r\n\r\nFootnote 321:\r\n\r\n  _Semper ego auditor tantum_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe same tone is maintained throughout, and when poetry and literature\r\nappear (which is not extremely often), poets and men of letters are\r\ntreated as practitioners of a rather troublesome, nearly superfluous,\r\nand slightly disreputable, profession, not as bad or good artists as the\r\ncase may be. The stage-fright of the rhetorician who is going to make a\r\nspeech at Lyons (the gird at the provincial is obvious), the book-chest\r\nof Codrus, with the mice gnawing the divine poems, the Greek mania which\r\nalternates with others in wives, and the learned lady who talks for\r\nhours on the comparative merits of Homer and Virgil, are introduced with\r\nthe poet’s usual spirit and vigour, but very distinctly _not_ from the\r\nliterary point of view. They are ludicrous things and persons, good\r\nsatiric matter: but the book-chest is in the same class with the _lectus\r\nProcula minor_, the fancy for Greek with the fancy for gladiators, the\r\ncritical lady with her sister who enamels her face. It is by no means\r\nun-noteworthy that, in the Tenth itself, the vanity of literary study\r\nand success—an admirably suggestive subject—is hardly touched at all;\r\nthat the careers of Demosthenes and Cicero are held up as a moral\r\nbecause of their political ill-success, and the sanguinary fate of\r\neach—which might have happened to the most illiterate of men. But this\r\nis most noticeable of all in the Seventh, which may be said to have a\r\ndefinitely literary frame and scheme, or which at least certainly would\r\nhave had these in the hands of a man really inclined to literary\r\ncriticism. It opens with a characteristic picture of what the Americans\r\nwould call a “slump” in poetry—the most celebrated bards giving up the\r\nprofession in sheer despair, becoming bath-keepers, or stokers, or\r\nauctioneers’ criers, selling their tragedies at rummage sales, or at the\r\nvery best getting empty praise and no pudding from their stingy though\r\nwealthy patrons. Then Juvenal becomes a little graver, and contrasts the\r\nvictim of _cacoethes scribendi_ with the really exceptional poet (whom\r\nhe cannot point out, and only imagines), who will put forth no\r\nhack-work, and writes not even for fame, but to please himself and the\r\nMuses. Such a poet must be in independent circumstances—if Virgil had\r\nhad no boy to wait on him, and no tolerable lodging, all the snakes\r\nwould have dropped from the hair of his Erinyes, says he in one of his\r\nmost characteristic Juvenalisms. Lucan happened to be well off: but\r\nStatius, for all the popularity of his _Thebais_, would have gone\r\ndinnerless if he had not sold his _Agave_ to the actor Paris (apparently\r\nto pass off as his own).[322] Nor is the historian’s labour more\r\nprofitable. Indeed it is less so, for it consumes more paper, more time,\r\nand more oil for the lamp, as Juvenal points out in what some modern\r\nreviewers would call “his flippant manner.” Even the much-praised trade\r\nof the orator brings in wretched fees as a rule—a ham, a jar of\r\nsardines, a bunch of onions, half-a-dozen of common wine. If you wish to\r\nsoar higher in the matter of receipts, you must spend greatly, have\r\nhandsome horses, furniture, rings. Merely teaching to declaim may be\r\nrather more profitable, but think of the intolerable boredom of the\r\nbusiness! the same patter of stock declamations and exercises, the\r\nunreality and folly of it all! True, there are exceptions—and here comes\r\na curious passage, half satirical, half complimentary, on Quintilian\r\nhimself, but treating him not in the least from the literary standpoint.\r\nAnd so to the end.\r\n\r\nFootnote 322:\r\n\r\n  I think _intactam_ insinuates this. But it may only mean that the play\r\n  was produced “for the first time on any stage,” though this seems\r\n  feebler. Some would have it that Paris, as being a pantomime, was to\r\n  travesty the thing.\r\n\r\nThis abstract, though brief, should be sufficient to establish our\r\npoint—that Juvenal, while he rarely cared to touch strictly literary\r\nsubjects, hardly ever treated them in a strictly literary manner. He\r\nshared the opinion of the best Roman literary judges at all times—and\r\nespecially in his own times, when the popular current was setting in the\r\nopposite direction—that literary style ought to be plain, nervous,\r\nmanly; and he could express this with even better right than Persius,\r\ninasmuch as his own, though extremely allusive and of the most original\r\ncharacter, is quite clear from involution or conceit. But he did not\r\ncare in the least to investigate literary processes: nor did he trouble\r\nhimself very much to contrast styles and differentiate their values. One\r\nmay even, without any rashness of guess, be certain that he would have\r\nregarded criticism of form with nearly as much disfavour in a man as he\r\nexpressly does in a woman. In fact, he would have considered it the\r\noccupation of a fribble.\r\n\r\nWhen we pass to the graceful graceless crowd of motes, or rather midges\r\n(for they have a very distinct bite), which composes [Sidenote:\r\n_Martial._] the works of Martial, we find, as has been said, very much\r\nthe same general attitude towards styles in literature. But the\r\nexpression is differentiated, not merely by the existence in the writer\r\nof a different moral complexion, but by the necessary conditions of his\r\nform. _They_ could discuss; _he_ can only glance. Further, the avowed\r\npurpose of amusement, of composing the verses of a very peculiar\r\nsociety, which animates the epigrams practically throughout, affects the\r\nresult very considerably. Their author resembles both Persius and\r\nJuvenal in paying very elaborate attention to the outside of things, to\r\nthe accidents of the literary business. We hear in him continually the\r\necho of the _sophos_, the “bravo!” which the reciter and the rhetorician\r\nsought for, and which they sometimes, if not often, procured by the\r\nagency of a regular _claque_. We learn (not in the least to our\r\nsurprise) that then, as now, there existed the kind literary friend who\r\nwas quite eager to receive presentation copies, but who was by no means\r\nready to go to the publishers and exchange even an extremely moderate\r\nnumber of his own denarii for a nice clean book, on polished vellum and\r\nneatly rubricated.[323] There were also then, as now, readers or\r\nreviewers who would take copyists’ (_lege_ “printers’”) errors very\r\nseriously, and upbraid the poet for them[324]—which he did not bear\r\npatiently.\r\n\r\nFootnote 323:\r\n\r\n  i. 117.\r\n\r\nFootnote 324:\r\n\r\n  ii. 8.\r\n\r\nHere we have the certainly pointed, if not very polite, excuse for not\r\nsubmitting to the same tax of presentation copies, that he fears his\r\nfriend may reply with a present of _his_ works:[325] elsewhere (in those\r\ntriumphs of ingenious trifling the _apophoreta_, or gift-tickets) the\r\nneat suggestion, with a blank album, that a poet can offer no more\r\nacceptable present than paper _not_ written upon.[326] In one place\r\nthere is, to carry off a piece of sheer begging, an irresistibly comic\r\nanecdote of a “curious impertinent,” who after asking whether the poet\r\nis not the Martial whom everybody not a fool admires, and receiving a\r\nconfession of the soft impeachment, abruptly demands why such a poet has\r\nsuch a shocking bad great-coat, and receives the meek reply, _quia sum\r\nmalus poeta_.[327] But these, and a good many others, which an easy\r\nreading, and a not very troublesome classification, of the _Epigrams_\r\nwill enable any one to produce, are examples parallel rather to our\r\ncitations from Juvenal than to the capital one from Persius. That is to\r\nsay, they are examples rather of the selection of a particular subject,\r\nas one of a hundred suitable to the special mode of treatment, than of\r\nthe assertion or the display of any particular interest in that subject,\r\nor any special theories upon it. So, too, in some cases of more special\r\nreference, Martial’s habits of flattery, and the unblushing way in which\r\n(not for the first or the last time) men of letters in his generation\r\nwere wont to fish for presents, make it not always quite easy to know\r\nhow much seriousness to attach to his expressions of opinion on\r\nparticular writers. Did he, for instance, really think Silius Italicus\r\nsuch a great poet?[328] One cannot say: it is certain that Silius was\r\nrich, and a person who seems to have been able to keep his head above\r\nwater, and on his shoulders, during all the stormy changes of his\r\nlifetime. And if such a man wrote poetry, if he was not his enemy—still\r\nmore if, as was the case here, he was his friend—we know but too well\r\nthat Marcus Valerius Martialis was never likely to _publish_ any\r\nunflattering opinion of it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 325:\r\n\r\n  vii. 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 326:\r\n\r\n  xiv. 10.\r\n\r\nFootnote 327:\r\n\r\n  vi. 82.\r\n\r\nBut, in a very large number of cases, there was no possibility of\r\nhoodwinking, nor any object in attempting the operation. In [Sidenote:\r\n_The style of the Epigrams._] the very numerous references to his own\r\nbooks, Martial shows us that he wrote, not at haphazard but with the\r\nkeenest critical knowledge of the requirements of the form. That he\r\nrecognises, in more places than one,[329] Catullus as his own master,\r\nmodel, and superior, is itself a critical document and testimonial of\r\nthe first value. For it is notorious that the Romans, as a rule, by no\r\nmeans rated the great poet of Verona at his due; and though the sneer of\r\nHorace[330] may have been dictated by a sufficiently ignoble but very\r\nintelligible jealousy, the slight and passing note of Quintilian[331]\r\nadmits of no such explanation. But it was the Catullus of the epigrams\r\nthat Martial endeavoured to rival. In doing so he shows that he had a\r\nvery definite, and a very just, notion of the versification and diction\r\nnecessary to his purpose. His praise of the _Romana simplicitas_ shown\r\nin the style of the lampoon of Augustus on Fulvia, in respect to which\r\none can only refer modern readers to the original,[332] is capable of\r\nbeing mistaken for a mere laudation of coarse language—for an\r\nanticipation of that curious fallacy which has more than once made men\r\nregret the withdrawal of the licence to “talk greasily.” But this is\r\nunfair both to the poet and to the Emperor. Martial certainly does talk\r\ngreasily with a vengeance; but the last line of this Imperial\r\nfescenninity depends for its point by no means merely on the obscene,\r\nand is an excellent example of clear-cut, straight-hitting phrase.\r\n\r\nFootnote 328:\r\n\r\n  iv. 14; vii. 63.\r\n\r\nFootnote 329:\r\n\r\n  _E.g._, x. 78.\r\n\r\nFootnote 330:\r\n\r\n  _V. supra_, p. 229.\r\n\r\nFootnote 331:\r\n\r\n  _V. infra_, p. 311.\r\n\r\nFootnote 332:\r\n\r\n  xi. 20.\r\n\r\nThis phrase Martial himself almost always achieved, though in a few\r\ncases his points are still dark to us, and though he had not the\r\nslightest objection to using Greek words, vulgar words, and so forth\r\nwhen it suited his purpose. The misty magniloquence which attracted so\r\nmany men of his time had no charms for him. When he rises, as he\r\nsometimes does, from sheer naughtiness or playful trifling to pathos, to\r\nseriousness, to graceful description of landscape—in the well-known\r\nPætus and Arria piece, in the epitaphs on Erotion, and the still finer\r\none on Paris, in his country poems and elsewhere—he is purely Attic. No\r\nstyle can have a simpler and a less affectedly simple grace. And that he\r\ndid this deliberately—that it was his theory as well as his practice—we\r\nmay see very well from a sort of cento of passages bearing on the\r\nsubject. He differs not merely from Catullus but from Prior (who is\r\nperhaps his nearest analogue in almost all ways) by having obviously no\r\nvelleities towards the grand style. We can imagine Prior writing, and\r\nwriting quite as well, the piece which tells how pretty Phyllis, when\r\nher lover was racking his brains for some elegant present to reward her\r\nkindness past, exerted fresh coaxing before asking him for—a jar of\r\nwine,[333] or describing the singular history of Galla on the stock- and\r\nshare-lists of Love.[334] But we cannot imagine Martial writing _Alma_\r\nor _Solomon_. And all his critical observations, direct or indirect,\r\ntestify to a conception of literature perfectly clear and not really\r\ndeserving the term narrow, if only because the poet quite frankly limits\r\nit to the kind in which he wishes to, and knows that he can, excel, the\r\nkind indicated in his own famous quatrain:—\r\n\r\n               “Ille ego sum nulli nugarum laude secundus\r\n                 Quem non ignoras, sed puto lector amas:\r\n               Majores majora sonent, mihi parva locuto\r\n                 Sufficit in vestras sæpe redire manus.”\r\n\r\nLet us see what morsels of criticism such handling furnishes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 333:\r\n\r\n  xii. 65.\r\n\r\nFootnote 334:\r\n\r\n  x. 75.\r\n\r\nThe prose preface and the opening epigrams of the first book contain\r\nhumorous statements of his own fame, excuses (not quite valid) for his\r\nlicence of speech, and jocose exaggerations of the critical temper of\r\nthe times; but there is not much doctrine in them. There is more in ii.\r\n77, where, not in the best temper [Sidenote: _Précis of their critical\r\ncontents._] (for Martial, like some other persons, though he loved to\r\ncriticise, was not excessively fond of being criticised), he points out\r\nto a certain Cusconius what the French wit afterwards borrowed from him\r\nin the phrase “ce n’est pas long, mais il y a des longueurs.” Verses, he\r\nsays, like his own, though there may be many of them, are not long\r\nbecause they can spare nothing, because there is nothing otiose in them.\r\nCusconius, on the other hand, can write distichs which are long. There\r\nis a not uninteresting glance at the fashionable literary subjects and\r\nkinds—History of the times of Claudius, criticism of the myths about\r\nNero (these could be safely done under the Flavian emperors), fables in\r\nthe style of Phædrus, tender elegiacs and stern hexameters, Sophoclean\r\ntragedy or Attic salt—in iii. 20. Another French jest—one of the very\r\nbest of Piron on La Chaussée—is anticipated with variation in the 25th\r\nof the same book, by the suggestion to a friend whose baths have been\r\noverheated, that he should ask Sabinæus the rhetor to bathe. _He_ can\r\nreduce the temperature of the Thermæ of Nero themselves. IV. 49 gives us\r\nanother critical laudation of the epigram. Flaccus is quite wrong to\r\nthink it child’s play. The poet is much more guilty of that who busies\r\nhimself with Tereus and Thyestes and Dædalus and Polyphemus. There is no\r\nmere bombast in _his_ book: _his_ Muse is not frounced with senseless\r\ntragic train.[335] “But,” says Flaccus, “the others are the things that\r\npeople praise.” “Perhaps,” says Martial, “they praise _them_: but they\r\nread _me_,” with of course the implied and very sound criticism that it\r\nis not so easy to write what shall be easy to read. V. 10 ends with a\r\njest, the poet saying that if his fame is to come after his death he\r\nhopes it will come late. But it treats rather seriously the other “touch\r\nof nature” (opposite to that of which Shakespeare speaks and\r\ncomplementary to it), that in literature, and at times [not always, O\r\nMartial!] men do _not_ “praise new-born gauds.” They read Ennius in the\r\nlifetime of Virgil, laughed at Homer [the evidence for this?] in his own\r\ndays, preferred Philemon to Menander, and left Ovid to the appreciation\r\nof Corinna.[336] But he shows his less critical mood in setting this\r\ndown to envy rather than to the undoubted fact that, in at least many\r\ncases, poets anticipate, if they do not exactly create, the taste for\r\nthem—that, as it has been said, a poet’s chief admirers are born at\r\nabout the time when he writes. The necessity of some “bite”[337] in\r\nepigrams, vii. 25, is counsel at least as much of common-sense as of\r\nliterature. In the 85th of the same, the poet objects to Sabellus that\r\nhe can write a few quatrains rather well, but not a book—by which he\r\nprobably glances at the necessity, in a book, of varying and sorting the\r\nkinds, as well as of providing a mere quantity of monotonous stuff. And\r\nin the 90th again of the same book he is still more explicitly\r\nargumentative. A certain Matho, it seems, went about saying that\r\nMartial’s books were unequal. If this be so, retorts our bard, it is\r\nbecause Calvinus (? or Cluvienus, as in Juvenal) and Umber write “equal”\r\nverses, and a bad book is always an “equal” one.\r\n\r\nFootnote 335:\r\n\r\n  _Insano syrmate tumet._\r\n\r\nFootnote 336:\r\n\r\n  Another and severer side of the same epigram is that, viii. 69, to\r\n  Vacerra, who only praises dead poets. To die in order to please\r\n  Vacerra, says the bard, is not quite _tanti_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 337:\r\n\r\n  _Sapit quæ novit pungere._\r\n\r\nNow, what exactly did he mean by “equal”? When we say that a book is\r\nunequal, we generally mean that it has faults as well as beauties, that\r\nit is not equally good, and in this sense Martial would merely be\r\nvindicating himself from the charge of a tame faultlessness, from that\r\n_æqualis mediocritas_ which Quintilian smites in passing. But, if we\r\ntake it in conjunction with the Sabellus epigram just quoted, I think it\r\nwill not be unfair to allow to _æqualis_ also its other sense of\r\n“unvarying,” “monotonous,” and give the prominence to this in the\r\nequivalence with _malus_ of the last line.[338] Martial specially and\r\ncritically prided himself on the variety of his books, on their\r\ncontaining something for every taste, and something (almost) about every\r\nsubject. And the book, he says therefore, that has not this quality is a\r\nbad book. The same doctrine pierces through the laudation of the prose\r\npreface of the Eighth to Domitian, and points the hope that the\r\ncelestial _verecundia_ of the “bald Nero” will not be offended by the\r\nnaughtier epigrams.\r\n\r\nFootnote 338:\r\n\r\n  There is yet another sense of _æqualis_, “like something else,” which\r\n  might be brought in.\r\n\r\nThe third of this eighth book contains an interesting dialogue between\r\nthe Poet and his Muse. Were it not, says he, better to stop? Are not six\r\nor seven books enough and too much? Their fame is far and widely spread,\r\nand when the monuments of the great are dust they will be, and strangers\r\nwill take them to their own country. It is never quite easy to know\r\nwhether Martial is laughing in his sleeve or not in these boastings. But\r\nthe ninth of the sisters, her hair and garments dripping with perfume\r\n(probably Thalia, certainly not one of the _Musæ severiores_), upbraids\r\nhim with ingratitude and folly. Why drop these pleasantries? What better\r\npastime will he find? Will he change his sock for the buskin, or arrange\r\nhexameters to tell of wars, that pedants may spout him, and that good\r\nboys and fair girls may loathe his name? Let the grave and precise write\r\nsuch things by their midnight lamp. But for him, let an elegant saltness\r\ndash his Roman books, let real living people recognise and read their\r\nown actions and characters; and if the oat be thin, remember that it\r\nconquers the trumpets of many. The Epigram here, it will be seen,\r\narrogates to itself something like the place of the full Satire.\r\n\r\nThis, one of the best and most spirited of Martial’s literary\r\npronouncements, is followed up in a lower key by the 56th epigram of the\r\nsame book, addressed to that Flaccus who is elsewhere the recipient of\r\nthe poet’s literary confidences. It contains the famous line—\r\n\r\n          “Sint[339] Mæcenates, non deerunt, Flacce, Marones”—\r\n\r\nand elaborates the doctrine that the patron makes the poet, comfort, if\r\nnot luxury, the poetry, in an ingenious but impudent manner, carrying\r\noff the impudence, however, by the close. What, he supposes Flaccus to\r\nsay, will you be a Virgil if I give you what Mæcenas gave him? Well, no,\r\nperhaps: but I may be a Marsus—a poet who wrote many things, but chiefly\r\nin the occasional kind, whom Martial greatly admired, and whose epilogue\r\non Tibullus—\r\n\r\n             “Te quoque Virgilio comitem non æqua Tibulle”—\r\n\r\nwith two or three other fragments, we possess.[340] And the same\r\ndoctrine, that love and luxury are needful to the bard, reappears in 73.\r\n\r\nFootnote 339:\r\n\r\n  Some MSS. and edd. read _sunt_: but _sint_ is so clearly required that\r\n  this seems mere perversity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 340:\r\n\r\n  Baehrens, _Poet. Lat. Min._, vi. 346-348.\r\n\r\nMartial does not often come down to the minutiæ of criticism, but he\r\nsometimes does, and once in a very noteworthy passage, ix. 11. Here, in\r\nsome of his most gracefully fluttering verses, he celebrates the charm\r\nof the name[341] Eiarinos or Earinos, notes that unless he takes the\r\nepic licence of the first form it will not come into verse, and then\r\nadds—\r\n\r\n                  “Dicunt Eiarinon tamen poetæ,\r\n                  Sed Græci, quibus est nihil negatum\r\n                  Et quos Ἄρες ἄρες decet sonare:\r\n                  Nobis non licet esse tam disertis,\r\n                  Qui Musas colimus severiores.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 341:\r\n\r\n  _Nomen cum violis rosisque natum._ Wherefore Ben Jonson took it for\r\n  the heroine of this most beautiful thing, _The Sad Shepherd_.\r\n\r\nThere are two things noticeable here—first, Martial’s truly poetical\r\nsensitiveness to the beauty of a name, for certainly there is none\r\nprettier than Earine (let him keep the masculine to himself!) which also\r\nappears elsewhere; and secondly his equally poetical yearning for that\r\nlicence of “common” quantification, which has made Greek and English the\r\ntwo great poetical languages of the world.[342] If he would have\r\ndeveloped these views a little oftener, and at a little greater length,\r\nwe really could have spared a considerable number of epigrams imputing\r\nunmentionable offences to the persons he did not like. It was his cue,\r\nhowever, to profess (though half his charm comes from his sense of them)\r\ndisdain for such niceties, as in the 81st epigram of the same book,\r\nwhich is one of his neatest turns. Readers, he says, and hearers like\r\nhis books, but a certain poet denies that they are correctly finished\r\n(_exactos_). It does not trouble him much, for he would rather that the\r\ncourses of the feast he offers pleased the guests than that they pleased\r\nthe cooks. In this, light as it is, there lurks the germ of a weighty\r\ncriticism, and one which would, had it been worked out, have carried\r\nMartial far from the ordinary critical standpoint of his time. That, in\r\nhomely phrase analogous to his own, the proof of the pudding is in the\r\neating—that the production of the poetical satisfaction afterwards, not\r\nthe satisfaction of the examiners beforehand as to the observation of\r\nthe rules, is the thing—that Martial doubtless saw, and that he, by\r\nimplication, says. But he does not say it quite openly, and it might\r\nhave shocked Quintilian (though it would not have shocked Longinus) if\r\nhe had.\r\n\r\nFootnote 342:\r\n\r\n  My friend Professor Hardie rather demurs to the idea of “common”\r\n  syllables being commoner in Greek than in Latin, save possibly in\r\n  proper names. But I had certainly thought they were, and, even if we\r\n  allow for some poetic and humorous exaggeration in _nihil negatum_, it\r\n  seems to show that Martial thought so too.\r\n\r\nThe Tenth book is particularly rich in literary epigrams. It opens with\r\na batch of them,—one of his pleasant excuses for yet another\r\nreappearance (the pieces are so short that if you don’t like the book\r\nyou can lay it down as finished at any moment), an honest indication of\r\nthe fact that some of the epigrams are only new editions, so to speak,\r\nof old ones, smoothed with a recent file, one of the not disagreeably\r\nboasting reminders that letters outlive brass and marble (a boast\r\njustified in his own case, but not so, alas! in those of Marsus and\r\nothers whom he admitted as his masters), a strongly worded protest\r\nagainst some clandestine poet who has been forging bad epigrams in his\r\nname, a repetition of the old contemptuous pooh-poohing of stock Greek\r\nsubjects, and the old exhortation to study the life. The 19th, in a\r\npleasant _envoy_ of the book to Pliny, bids the Muse who carries it\r\nobserve her time, and not disturb the grave man at his graver hours. The\r\n21st is an expostulation with a certain Sextus, who seems to have prided\r\nhimself on the eccentric vocabulary of his poems. What is the use of\r\nwriting so that Modestus and Claranus themselves (known men of learning)\r\ncan scarcely understand you, and so that your books demand not an\r\nordinary reader but the Delphic Apollo? You would prefer to Virgil\r\nCinna—Helvius Cinna, whose fancy for out-of-the-way words we can see,\r\neven in the petty wreckage of his work that time has fated to us.[343]\r\nPerhaps, Martial admits, such poems may be praised; but he would rather\r\nhave grammarians like his work, and not be necessary to its liking.[344]\r\nThe 35th is a specially graceful compliment to the poetess Sulpicia, who\r\nwrote her love poems (apparently rather warm ones[345]) to her husband\r\nonly, and with whom, says Martial, for schoolmate or schoolmistress,\r\nSappho herself would have been _doctior et pudica_—a right happy\r\nblending of comparative and positive. 70 is a quaint apology, not for\r\nwriting so much but for writing so little, the satire of which is so\r\ningeniously airy that it is possible to interpret its irony in more ways\r\nthan one. Potitus calls him lazy because he does not bring out more than\r\none book a-year. What time has a man to write poetry? Calls and\r\ncongratulations (which, somehow, he does not find returned), attendances\r\nat religious and official functions, listening the whole day long to\r\nother poets, to advocates, to declaimers, to very grammarians, the bath,\r\nthe _sportula_—why, the whole day slips away sometimes without one’s\r\nbeing able to settle to work at all!\r\n\r\nThe 78th, addressed to Macer, contains the graceful request—\r\n\r\n                   “Nec multos mihi præferas poetas,\r\n                   Uno sed tibi sim minor Catullo”—\r\n\r\nwhich shows Martial’s faithfulness to his exquisite master.\r\n\r\nFootnote 343:\r\n\r\n  Cf. the technical words _carchesia_, _anquina_ in the fragment of his\r\n  _Propempticon Pollionis_, Baehrens, _Poetæ Latini Minores_, vi. 323.\r\n\r\nFootnote 344:\r\n\r\n  _Grammaticis placeant, et sine grammaticis._\r\n\r\nFootnote 345:\r\n\r\n  _V._ the only remaining fragment in Baehrens, _Poet. Lat. Min._, vi.\r\n  370. The satirical piece, usually printed with Juvenal and assigned to\r\n  a Sulpicia, _may_ be hers: but at any rate Martial was not thinking of\r\n  anything of the kind. He varies his own conceit in vii. 69 on a\r\n  certain Theophila.\r\n\r\nThe Eleventh and Twelfth, the last of the epigrams proper (for the\r\n_Xenia_ and _Apophoreta_[346] have been dealt with so far as the little\r\nthat they have concerns us, and the _Liber de Specta culis_ is out of\r\nthe question), are also fruitful. The common habit of addressing the\r\nbook itself at its beginning frequently has a literary turn given to it\r\nby Martial, and as in the Tenth so in the Eleventh, not one but a batch\r\nappears as overture, chiefly dedicatory; while another batch farther on\r\nis opened by the promise, certainly not falsified, that the book is\r\ngoing to be the naughtiest of all. The 90th, however, is important for\r\nus, though by no means immaculate, because the sudden fling of a handful\r\nof mud, in which Martial too often delights, is led up to by satire on\r\nthat same preference for uncouth and archaic language, which, as we have\r\nseen, so often defrays the satiric criticism of the time. Chrestillus,\r\nthe victim, it seems, approves no smooth verses; they must roll over\r\nrocks and jolt on half-made roads to please him. A verse like\r\n\r\n               “Luceili columella heic situ’ Metrophanes”\r\n\r\nis better to him than all Homer, and he worships _terrai frugiferai_ and\r\nall the jargon of Attius and Pacuvius.\r\n\r\nFootnote 346:\r\n\r\n  It ought, however, perhaps to be added that these include a\r\n  considerable batch of inscription-distichs for presents of books from\r\n  Homer and Virgil downwards. Most of these are decorative but\r\n  conventional: that on Lucan (194), “There are those who say that I am\r\n  not a poet; but my bookseller thinks me one,” is keen with a double\r\n  edge.\r\n\r\nThe prose preface of the Twelfth book starts with an excuse for a three\r\nyears’ silence (it would appear that for a considerable time Martial had\r\nproduced a book yearly), due to the poet’s return to Spain. He had been,\r\nas the epigram above quoted pleads, too busy or too lazy to write in\r\ntown; in the country he found himself deprived of the material for\r\nwriting. The stimulating, teasing occupations of Rome had given place to\r\nmere clownish vacancy. However, to please Priscus, he has busied himself\r\nagain, and he only hopes that his friend will not find his work “not\r\nmerely Spanish of the Roman Pale, but Spanish pure and simple.”[347] In\r\nthe third epigram there is a half-rueful recommendation (which Thackeray\r\nwould have translated impeccably) to his book to revisit the dear old\r\nplaces, ending with a distich revindicating, in no wise foolishly, the\r\ncrown of style—\r\n\r\n           “Quid titulum poscis? Versus duo tresve legantur,\r\n           Clamabunt omnes te, liber, esse meum.”\r\n\r\nHe was right. Nobody but Martial could have written Martial except\r\nCatullus himself in his less noble moods; and the boast is in itself a\r\ncriticism and a just one. Yet Martial had his dignity, and an odd\r\nepigram, the 61st of this book, disclaims the mere coarse language in\r\nwhich he seems to us too often to have indulged. And the tale of\r\nliterary epigrams ceases (I apologise for omissions in the bright and\r\nshifting bevy) with another odd piece, which may be either gross\r\nflattery, irony of a rather sanguinary kind, or mere playfulness, and in\r\nwhich he remonstrates with his friend Tucca for touching and executing,\r\nso as to make competition impossible, every kind of poetry. Epic,\r\ntragedy, lyric, satire, epigram itself—Martial has tried them all and\r\ndropped them, because he feels himself beaten by Tucca. This is not\r\nfair; let Tucca leave him at least one kind, the kind that he doesn’t\r\ncare for. It is not fanciful, surely, to find a critique of poetical\r\npolypragmatism here also.\r\n\r\nFootnote 347:\r\n\r\n  _Non Hispaniensem sed Hispanum._\r\n\r\nIt may well seem to some that too much space has been accorded to\r\nMartial; but it has been allotted on the principle which, be it mistaken\r\nor not, is the principle that underlies this book. We have, in this\r\ngood-for-nothing trifler, a very considerable number of pronouncements\r\non critical points, or points connected with criticism, and, what is\r\nmore, we have in him a writer who has a very clear notion of literary\r\ncriticism in and for his own work. A great poet Martial is not: he has\r\nno fine madness, or only the remotest touches of it. He does not look\r\nback to the way in which Lucretius had infused that quality into the\r\nlanguage; I do not think, speaking under correction, that he ever so\r\nmuch as names him. He does not anticipate (and if he had anticipated, he\r\nwould not, I think, have welcomed with any pleasure) the tide which,\r\nwelling in upon the severer Muses of classical Latin style, gave them\r\nonce more the Siren quality in the Low Latin of the Middle Ages.\r\nFarther, he can hardly be said to have any “wood-notes wild”; even his\r\ncountry descriptions, charming as they are, are distinctly artificial.\r\nMuch as he adores Catullus, it is not for the flashes of pure poetry\r\nwhich we see in that poet. But, on the other hand, Martial sees, not\r\nmerely with instinctive but with critical certainty, that gift of\r\nprecision, clearness, felicity, _venustas_, which the Greek-Latin blend\r\nof the Golden and Silver Ages had. He practises and he preaches the\r\ncultivation of this. He preaches it at no tedious length: his chosen\r\nform as well as his common-sense would have prevented that. But he\r\ndirectly extols the cultivation of style—of that quality which will make\r\nany decent judge identify a poet when he has heard three lines of his\r\npoem. And he practises what he preaches. Even what the grave and precise\r\n(quite truly one must confess) call his moral degradation saves him from\r\nconfusing the moral with the literary quality of literature—the noble\r\nerror of most ancient criticism. He has, as scarcely any other ancient\r\nwriter has, formulated the great critical question, “L’ouvrage est-il\r\nbon ou est-il mauvais?” And if he had chosen to write a _De Arte\r\nPoetica_, I am bound, shocking as the confession may seem, to say that I\r\nthink it would have been superior to that of Horace, while he has\r\nprovided no unimportant _progymnasmata_ towards one as it is.\r\n\r\nFrom “the mixed and subtle Martial,” as Gavin Douglas excellently\r\n[Sidenote: _Statius._] calls him, we may pass to the poet, perhaps the\r\nrival, whom he never mentions[348]—the author of that only adequate\r\nRoman description of Lucretius which has been referred to above.[349]\r\nThe precise sources of the popularity of Statius in the Middle Ages have\r\nnever yet, I think, been thoroughly investigated. It is, however, not\r\ndifficult to discern them afar off, and to include among them a certain\r\ntouch of that uncritical quality which, as we shall see, was one of the\r\nmain notes of the Middle Ages themselves. Yet the author of the words\r\n_furor arduus Lucreti_[350] must have been able at least to appreciate.\r\nAnd the poem which contains that phrase, as well as the prose prefaces\r\nof the _Sylvæ_ where it occurs, will yield something more bearing on our\r\nsubject. The first of these prefaces is a curious if not particularly\r\nfelicitous plea for the legitimacy—indeed, for the necessity—of a poet’s\r\nindulging in lighter work in the intervals of _Thebaids_ and\r\n_Achilleids_. This is something like the view of Pliny: the poet must be\r\na Jack-of-all-poetical-trades. Martial knew better. But it is a\r\nnoteworthy thing (and Martial himself would have been pungent on it)\r\nthat Statius cannot make his trifles brief. Domitian’s horse has nearly\r\nthree hundred lines. I do not think that there is a single poem in the\r\nfive books of the _Sylvæ_ which falls short of several scores, whatever\r\nits metre. In the preface of the second he apologises to his friend\r\nMelior for some of the pieces, as _libellos quasi epigrammatic loco\r\nscriptos_, and here again Martial might have had something to say about\r\nepigrams seventy-seven lines long. That Statius had not cleared up his\r\nown mind about criticism appears from the touching and attractive,\r\nthough not quite consummate, _Ad Claudiam Uxorem_, where the poet,\r\nbeaten in the public competitions where he had long triumphed, proposes\r\nthat Naples, and his wife’s caresses, shall console him for the loss of\r\ntasteless and thankless Rome. But the _Genethliacon Lucani_, a\r\ncommemorative birth-day poem on Lucan (which would have been a little\r\nmore effective if we could forget that this tribute to the victim of\r\nNero was written by a flatterer of Domitian), contains the central\r\nutterance of Statius about other poets. It is, as nearly everything of\r\nStatius has been said to be, too long and too much improvised, though\r\nalso, like most things, if not everything, of his, it contains fine\r\ntouches, especially that of Lucan in the shades:—\r\n\r\n                  “Seu magna sacer et superbus umbra\r\n                  Nescis Tartaron, et procul nocentum\r\n                  Audis verbera, pallidumque visa\r\n                  Matris lampade respicis Neronem.”\r\n\r\nBut its interest for us, besides the Lucretian description, which is\r\nitself not improved by _docti_, consists in the long eulogy of Lucan\r\nhimself, and the repeated, and therefore not probably conventional,\r\nadvice to him not to be afraid of Virgil—\r\n\r\n                     “Bætin Mantua provocare noli;”\r\n\r\nand after some time—\r\n\r\n                  “Quin majus loquor; ipsa te Latinis\r\n                  Æneis venerabitur canentem.”\r\n\r\nIt would be clear from this, if we did not know it from the evidence of\r\nhis original work, that Statius was not on the side of the satirists,\r\nthat he had no objection to the Spanish _ampulla_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 348:\r\n\r\n  No one of his contemporaries, except Juvenal (_v. supra_, p. 255),\r\n  ever does mention Statius. It is indeed usually said that no classical\r\n  author does so, with the same exception.\r\n\r\nFootnote 349:\r\n\r\n  P. 216.\r\n\r\nFootnote 350:\r\n\r\n  _Et docti furor arduus Lucreti._ _Genethliacon Lucani, Sylv._, ii. 7.\r\n  76.\r\n\r\nThe, in all ways very delightful, Epistles[351] of the younger Pliny are\r\nnot least delightful in the line of literary criticism. [Sidenote:\r\n_Pliny the Younger: Criticism on the Letters._] Pliny was a confirmed\r\nman of letters. In no member of the most interesting group of late\r\nFlavian and early Antonine writers do we see more clearly the “bookish”\r\ntone which so largely pervaded Roman society. He even, on the celebrated\r\noccasion[352] when he tells Tacitus with modest pride that he had bagged\r\nthree wild boars, _et quidem pulcherrimos_, admits that he sat at the\r\nnets with a pencil and a notebook, thus anticipating the action of\r\nKingsley’s Lancelot Smith when he took St Francis de Sales to a meet. He\r\ntakes an intelligent pride in his uncle’s literary work, and if he is a\r\nlittle wrong in doubting Martial’s power of “lasting” in the letter\r\nwhich he writes after his death,[353] let us remember that Martial had\r\npaid him a very pretty compliment (which he quotes and which we have\r\nquoted[354]), and that it would not have done to be too certain of the\r\nfact of this coming to Prince Posterity. The very first letter[355]\r\nadmits a particular critical care in composition, and the second gives\r\nfurther particulars thereof. He had never taken such care as with the\r\nbook that he sends to Arrian. He had tried to follow Demosthenes and\r\nCalvus, but few, _quos æquus amavit_ (this allusiveness would have been\r\nreprehended by some of our modern critics), can really catch up such\r\nmasters. The matter was good, and he had sometimes ventured to extract\r\nspecial ornaments from the “perfume-bottles”[356] of Cicero. But Arrian\r\nmust give him a careful revision, for the booksellers tell him that the\r\nthing is already popular. He has many of the technical phrases which\r\nhalf attract and half repel modern readers, because they are so\r\ndifficult to adjust. There is something like a miniature review in his\r\ndescription of the works of Pompeius Saturninus to Erucius in i. 16.\r\nThis Pompey has something so _varium_, so _flexibile_, so _multiplex_,\r\nthat he holds Pliny’s entire attention. He had heard him pleading both\r\nwith and without preparation, _acriter et ardenter, nec minus polite et\r\nornate_. There were in these speeches _acutæ, crebræque sententiæ_, a\r\ngrave and decorous construction, sonorous and archaic terms (Martial and\r\nPersius would have shaken heads). “All these things,” he says, “please\r\nstrangely when they are rolled forth in a rushing flood, and they please\r\neven if they are read over again. You will think as I do when you have\r\nhis orations in your hands, orations comparable to those of any of the\r\nancients whom he rivals. Yet he is still more satisfactory in History,\r\nwhether you take his brevity, or his light, or his sweetness, or his\r\nsplendour, or his sublimity. In popular addresses he is the same as in\r\nOratory, though more compressed and circumscript, and wound together.\r\nHis verses are as good as Catullus or Calvus, and full of elegance,\r\nsweetness, bitterness, love! and his Letters (which he calls his wife’s)\r\nare like Plautus or Terence without the metre.” Truly an Admirable\r\nCrichton of a Pompeius Saturninus! and great pity it is that he has not\r\ncome down to us, this “Cambridge the everything”[357]—of _circa_ 100\r\nA.D.\r\n\r\nFootnote 351:\r\n\r\n  It did not seem necessary to specify editions of Persius, Juvenal, and\r\n  Martial. For Pliny I use that of Keil, Leipsic, 1886.\r\n\r\nFootnote 352:\r\n\r\n  I. vi. Ed. cit., p. 5.\r\n\r\nFootnote 353:\r\n\r\n  III. 21, p. 65.\r\n\r\nFootnote 354:\r\n\r\n  _V. supra_, p. 264.\r\n\r\nFootnote 355:\r\n\r\n  _Hortatus es ut epistolas si quas paulo accuratius scripsissem\r\n  colligerem ... Collegi._\r\n\r\nFootnote 356:\r\n\r\n  ληκύθους. The word, whether from the use of its diminutive in the\r\n  _Frogs_ or not, seems to have become a stock metaphor for rhetorical\r\n  tropes. It has even been compared to _ampulla_, though I fancy it was\r\n  not quite so uncomplimentary, and meant “prettiness,” “conceit,”\r\n  rather than “bombast.” Both, however, illustrate the view, put\r\n  frequently in Book I. and here, as to the ancient conception of style.\r\n\r\nFootnote 357:\r\n\r\n  If the reader is in ignorance of this worthy, he can cure his disease\r\n  by any one of three pleasant medicines—Boswell, Horace Walpole, and Mr\r\n  Austin Dobson’s _Eighteenth Century Vignettes_.\r\n\r\nBut the most famous of Pliny’s letters in connection with this subject\r\nis the twentieth of the first book,[358] to Tacitus, in which he deals\r\nwith a set question of literary criticism. “A certain learned and\r\nskilful man” maintains that in oratory brevity is everything. In certain\r\ncases, Pliny admits, but only in certain cases. The adversary objects\r\nLysias among the Greeks, the Gracchi and Cato among the Romans. Pliny\r\nretorts with Demosthenes, Æschines, Hyperides, Pollio, Cæsar, Cælius,\r\nCicero. Indeed he does not fear to lay it down as a general principle,\r\n“the bigger the better.”[359] The adversary says that the orators spoke\r\nless than they published. Pliny dissents. And then he discusses the\r\nmatter generally—from the point of view of oratory in the main, but\r\npartly also from that of literature. And his general view, like that of\r\nhis generation (I hardly know whether to include his master Quintilian\r\nor not), may be taken as put in the phrase, _Non enim amputata oratio et\r\nabscissa, sed lata et magnifica et excelsa tonat, fulgurat, omnia\r\ndenique perturbat ac miscet_.[360]\r\n\r\nFootnote 358:\r\n\r\n  P. 16.\r\n\r\nFootnote 359:\r\n\r\n  _Ut aliæ bonæ res, ita bonus liber melior est quisque, quo major._\r\n\r\nFootnote 360:\r\n\r\n  This letter contains an interesting _mot_ of Aquilius Regulus, the\r\n  brilliant and questionable orator-informer, of whom Pliny frequently\r\n  speaks with a sort of mixture of admiration and dislike, reminding one\r\n  of the way in which men used to speak of Lord Chancellor Westbury.\r\n  “You,” said Regulus to him, “hunt out everything in your brief. I see\r\n  the throat at once, and go for it”—_ego jugulum statim video, hunc\r\n  premo_. There is some point in Pliny’s retort that people who do this\r\n  not infrequently hit knee or ankle instead.\r\n\r\nThe third letter of the second book is a set panegyric of Isæus,[361]\r\nwhich would be of more interest if criticisms of orators were not so\r\ncommon; the fifth of the third is the notice of the life, literary and\r\nother, of Pliny the Elder. The obituary criticism of Martial, to which\r\nreference has been made, occurs in the 21st of this third book, and is a\r\nlittle patronising. But the contemner of brevity, even if he were a\r\nprivate friend and a flattered one, and if he had (as most Romans would\r\nhave had) no objection to Martial’s freedom of subject and language,\r\ncould hardly be expected to do full justice to the epigrammatist.\r\n\r\nFootnote 361:\r\n\r\n  _Not_ the great Attic; but an Assyrian rhetor of Pliny’s own time,\r\n  supposed to be also referred to by Juvenal in the well-known phrase,\r\n  _Isæo torrentior_ (iii. 74).\r\n\r\nWe are less able to judge the literary part of the flattering epistle\r\n(iv. 3) to Antoninus, afterwards Emperor, which is so much in the\r\nextravagant style of Roman compliment that, in the absence of the work\r\nreferred to, it gives us no critical information whatever. The literary\r\ncharacteristic of the future Pius appeared to Pliny to be the mixture of\r\nthe severe with the agreeable—of the grave with the gay, which made his\r\nstyle extraordinary sweet, as the eighteenth century would have said.\r\nThe usual honey and its maker-bees put in the usual appearance to\r\nexpress Pliny’s sensations when he reads his correspondent’s Greek\r\nepigrams and iambics. He thinks of Callimachus or Herodes (doubtless our\r\njust recovered Herondas). Only neither has done anything so humane, so\r\nvenust, so sweet, so loving, so keen, so correct. How could a Roman\r\nwrite such Greek? It is more Attic than Athens, and Pliny grudges such a\r\nwriter to the Greeks, though there is no doubt that if Antoninus would\r\nonly write in his mother tongue he would do better still.\r\n\r\nIV. 14, enclosing some hendecasyllabics which have not come down (from\r\nother specimens they are a tolerable loss), contains some interesting\r\nand curious remarks on the always burning and never yet settled question\r\nof morality in literature. Pliny adopts to the full, as a matter of\r\nprinciple, the doctrine which his friend Martial had both practised and\r\npreached, that naughty things, and even the naughtiest words, may figure\r\nin poetry,—that, as Pliny himself puts it, with the still higher\r\nauthority of Catullus—\r\n\r\n                  “Nam castum esse decet pium poetam\r\n                  Ipsum—versiculos nihil necesse est.”\r\n\r\nOnly he himself declines to use the naughty words,[362] not out of\r\nprudery, but out of timidity. He follows this up with the sounder\r\ndoctrine that everything must be judged in its own kind.\r\n\r\nFootnote 362:\r\n\r\n  _Verba nuda._\r\n\r\nAnother short letter to Antoninus (iv. 18) not merely repeats the praise\r\nof his Greek epigrams, but informs us that Pliny himself has put some of\r\nthese in Latin. A longer one, which follows, to Calpurnia Hispulla,\r\ncontains an elaborate eulogy of the lady’s niece, Pliny’s second wife,\r\nwho shows her good taste and virtue by learning her husband’s books by\r\nheart, instructing herself in literature generally for love of him, and\r\nsinging his verses. And later, with something of the same innocence or\r\nlack of humour which was a Roman—in fact, has generally been a\r\nLatin—characteristic, he tells us that he has been for three days\r\nlistening _cum summa voluptate_ to a certain Sentius Augurinus, reciting\r\nhis poems or poemkins (_poematia_). Sentius, it seems, performed many\r\nthings with lightness, many with sublimity, many with beauty, many with\r\ntenderness, many with sweetness, many _with bile_. It is not quite clear\r\nunder which head comes the specimen he produces, which is a rather\r\nfeeble compliment to Pliny himself. “Vides,” says Pliny, after quoting\r\nit, “quam acuta omnia, quam apta, quam expressa.” Besides, he is the\r\nfriend of Spurinna and Antoninus. What an _emendatus adolescens_!\r\n\r\nV. 8[363] is a not uninteresting paper on History. Tutinius Capito\r\nwishes him, as he tells us others had done, to write this. Pliny is not\r\nill-disposed to do so, not because he thinks he shall do it very well,\r\nbut (the sentiment is a fine one, though a little bombastically\r\nexpressed) because “it seems to him one of the best of actions to rescue\r\nfrom perishing that which ought to be eternal.”[364] His idea of\r\nhistory, however, is not very lofty. Oratory and Poetry, he says, must\r\nhave style; History pleases howsoever it be written, because of the\r\nnatural curiosity of man—a doctrine which, in slightly changed matter,\r\nhas been joyfully accepted by the usual novelist. Besides, his uncle had\r\nbeen a diligent historian. Then why does he delay? Because he wants to\r\nexecute a careful recension of his speeches in important cases, and he\r\nhardly feels equal to both tasks, while, though there is much in common\r\nbetween Oratory and History, they are also different. The contrast is\r\ncurious, and shows the overweening position which Oratory had with the\r\nancients. To History, says Pliny, things humble and sordid, or at least\r\nmediocre, belong: to Oratory, all that is exquisite, splendid, and\r\nlofty.[365] The bare bones, muscles, and nerves suit history: Oratory\r\nmust have the swelling bulk of flesh and the waving plumes of hair.\r\nHistory pleases by rough, bitter energy:[366] Oratory by long-drawn\r\nsweetness. Diction, style, construction—all are different. After which\r\nhe gives a somewhat unexpected turn to the famous Thucydidean saying, by\r\nadmitting that history is the _ktema_, and the _agonisma_ oratory. And,\r\ntherefore, he thinks that he had better not attempt at once two things\r\nso different. A letter to Suetonius about the books of both (v. 10),\r\nanother to Spurinna (v. 17) about a recitation by Calpurnius Piso, a\r\nthird (vi. 15) on a thin jest by Javolenus Priscus at another recitation\r\nby a descendant of Propertius (who began “Prisce jubes,” and was\r\ninterrupted by Javolenus, _Ego vero non jubeo_), may be glanced at\r\nrather than discussed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 363:\r\n\r\n  There is another interesting critical remark at the end of the famous\r\n  description of the villa (v.6): “I think it the first duty of a writer\r\n  to _read his own title_, and constantly ask himself what he sat down\r\n  to write, and to be sure that if he sticks to his subject he will\r\n  never be too long, but will be hopelessly so if he drags other matters\r\n  in.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 364:\r\n\r\n  _Non pati occidere, quibus æternitas debeatur._\r\n\r\nFootnote 365:\r\n\r\n  This, of course, is the old invidious distinction between tragedy and\r\n  comedy revived in other material. Cf. the curious passage in Tacitus\r\n  (_Ann._, xiii. 31) in which he, for his part, glances disdainfully at\r\n  those who think “beams and foundation-stones” (Nero’s amphitheatre)\r\n  worth mentioning. such things should be kept for journals (_diurnis\r\n  urbis actis_): it is for the dignity of the Roman people that only\r\n  illustrious matters should find place in Annals. The two thoughts are\r\n  characteristic of the two men.\r\n\r\nFootnote 366:\r\n\r\n  _Vi, amaritudine, instantia._\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no better document of Pliny’s literary criticism, both\r\nin its strength and in its weakness, than vi. 17. He writes in a state\r\nof _indignatiuncula_ (let us translate “mild wrath”), which he can only\r\nrelieve by working it off in a letter to his friend Restitutus. He has\r\nbeen at one of the eternal recitations, where the book recited was not\r\nso usual; indeed, it was _absolutissimus_—quite “A per se,” as our\r\nancestors would have said. But one or two of the audience (clever[367]\r\nfellows, as they and a few others thought) listened to it as if they\r\nwere deaf mutes. They did not open their lips: they did not clap: they\r\ndid not even rise from their seats save when they were tired of sitting.\r\nWhat is the good of such gravity, such wisdom, nay, such laziness,\r\narrogance, _sinisterity_ (a good word!), or, to cut things short,\r\nmadness, which leads men to spend a whole day [the terrors of recitation\r\nwere obviously not exaggerated by the satirists] in offending and making\r\nan enemy of a man whom you have visited as a friend? Are you clever? Do\r\nnot show envy: the envier is the lesser. Nay, whether you can yourself\r\ndo as well, or less well, all the same praise him, whether he be\r\ninferior or superior or equal. Your superior, because, if he is not\r\npraiseworthy, still less are you; your equal or inferior, because the\r\nbetter he is, in that case, the better you are. Pliny, for his part, is\r\nwont to venerate and admire anybody who does anything in literature. It\r\nis a difficult thing, sir, an arduous, a fastidious, and it has a knack\r\nof bringing scorn on those who scorn it.[368] Restitutus will surely\r\nagree: he is the most amiable and considerate of judges. We may mark\r\nthis passage as, of many interesting ones, that which gives us Pliny’s\r\nmeasure as a literary critic best.\r\n\r\nFootnote 367:\r\n\r\n  _Diserti_, used here, as _disertior_ is lower, with the slightly\r\n  invidious sense which often attaches to the word, just as it does to\r\n  the English equivalent here used for it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 368:\r\n\r\n  _Est enim res difficilis, ardua, fastidiosa, et quæ eos, a quibus\r\n  contemnitur, invicem contemnat._\r\n\r\nBut the list of his noteworthy “places” is by no means closed. VI. 21\r\ngives us his standpoint in another famous quarrel—that of Ancients and\r\nModerns. He admires the former, but by no means so as to despise the\r\nlatter. He does not hold with the doctrine of the senescence of nature.\r\nHe recently heard Vergilius Romanus recite a comedy in the Old Comedy\r\nkind, which was as good as it could be. The same man has written\r\nmimiambics with perfect grace, comedies in another kind as good as\r\nMenander’s; he has force, grandeur, subtlety, bitterness, sweetness,\r\nneatness, he glorifies virtue, attacks vice, invents his\r\npersonages,[369] and uses real ones, with equal appropriateness. And (as\r\nby this time we begin to expect in such cases) “In writing about _me_ he\r\nhas only gone wrong by excessive kindness; and, after all, poets may\r\nfeign.” One sees that the excellent Pliny’s geese were swans in every\r\nquill.\r\n\r\nFootnote 369:\r\n\r\n  So I translate _nominibus_.\r\n\r\nVII. 4 deals at some length with his own poems, and gives some\r\nhexameters about Tiro and Cicero, which are in style quite worthy of the\r\nsubject. There are some elegiacs (rather better) in vii. 8, which is an\r\nelaborate recommendation of literary study—the turning of Greek into\r\nLatin, and _vice versa_, the refashioning and rearrangement of work\r\nalready done, the alternation of oratorical practice with history,\r\nletter-writing, and verse of the lighter kind, which receives an\r\nelaborate and not unhappy encomium. As for reading, read all the best\r\nmodels in all the styles in which you write. VII. 17 is on recitation;\r\n20 of the same book is one of several interesting, though slightly\r\namusing, letters to Tacitus, in which Pliny implies it to be his own\r\nopinion, and quotes it as that of others, that he and Tacitus were the\r\ntwo greatest literary men of Rome, and that it was quite wonderful that\r\nthey were such friends. What Tacitus thought of the conjunction we do\r\nnot know; he was probably too well bred a man to put his thought in\r\nwords, though a Tacitean expression of it would indeed be a treasure. In\r\nvii. 25 we meet another “swan,” Terentius Junior, who writes things\r\n_quam tersa omnia! quam Latina! quam Græca!_ Later, in the 30th, a\r\nfriend having compared his work, in vindication of Helvidius Priscus, to\r\nthat of Demosthenes against Midias, he confesses that he had had the\r\npiece in view, though he thinks it would have been _improbum et pæne\r\nfuriosum_ to have imagined rivalry possible. In viii. 4 he encourages\r\nthe friend to write an epic poem in Greek on the Dacian war, thereby\r\nincurring a considerable responsibility. The descendant of Propertius,\r\non whom Javolenus Priscus made that surpassing joke, recurs in ix. 22\r\nwith fresh praise; and the last literary letter of importance (the 26th\r\nof the same) is on what may be called the grand style in oratory.\r\n\r\nHere, as elsewhere, there may no doubt be room for difference of opinion\r\nas to the space and importance allowed to our witnesses. From the point\r\nof view of this book, however, Pliny’s testimony is of the utmost\r\nimportance. We may regret—I certainly do—that an equal abundance of\r\ndocuments of the same character has not come to us from some one of\r\ngreater literary competence—from Aristotle, or even from Dionysius, from\r\nLonginus, or even from Quintilian. But this is distinctly a case where\r\nthe better is enemy to the good. For the purpose of ascertaining what\r\nwas the actual state of critical opinion and literary taste at a given\r\ntime, it is of more value to possess such a collection as this of\r\nPliny’s than to have fifty _Arts of Poetry_.\r\n\r\nLet us “write off” liberally at the outset for the drawbacks of the\r\ndocument. Pliny’s Letters, pleasant as they are, are not free from a\r\nsuspicion, and, considering some statements of their own, something more\r\nthan a suspicion, of being not entirely spontaneous: they were, at any\r\nrate in some cases, evidently written for publication. The author\r\nhimself, though a man of excellent learning, of the completest\r\ncultivation of his day, of wide and ardent literary interests, and of no\r\nlittle common-sense, was, as some of his quoted judgments will have\r\nshown, not quite sufficiently possessed of the finest or most\r\ndiscriminating literary judgment. Moreover, he had a somewhat omnivorous\r\nand disproportionate opinion of the value of literary work, merely as\r\nsuch, even merely as something that looked such—compilation,\r\ntranslation, copying verse and prose, what not. Further, in these\r\ncharacteristics he to a great extent reflected those of his time—a time\r\nof great and active attention to literature, but rather one of talent\r\nthan of genius, a period of decadence in many respects, and hardly of\r\nresurrection in any, and lastly, a period of doubtful literary taste,\r\ninclining, when it was sincere, to the florid and Asiatic, when it\r\naffected superiority, to a forced Pseudo-Atticism and concinnity.\r\n\r\nYet it will readily be perceived that none of these allowances is\r\ndamning to the individual, while most of them even increase his value as\r\na representative of the period itself. That he was, and was regarded by\r\nthe time itself as, one of the most eminent of contemporary men of\r\nletters, cannot reasonably be doubted, though he certainly yokes himself\r\nrather unequally with Tacitus. And he is none the worse witness that,\r\nthough a generous admirer of antiquity, he avowedly was by no means so\r\nout of conceit with his own time as men of letters often are. That this\r\nage was no decrepit one need hardly be said—with Persius “dead ere his\r\nprime,” and Martial, Juvenal, Quintilian, Tacitus, Statius, and Pliny\r\nhimself, in full flourishing, with Marcus Aurelius and Arrian coming,\r\nwith Lucian and Apuleius not far off—to mention no others—it had\r\nsomething considerable to show and say for itself. If we can obtain\r\nanything like a clear view of its opinions on literary criticism (to\r\nwhich it was naturally inclined, as being itself not of the very first,\r\nand having pasts of the very first behind it), we shall not do ill. And\r\nPliny gives us help of a very special kind, and in very abundant degree,\r\nfor the attainment of such a view, which we may proceed to take, after\r\nnoticing briefly the only other documents of the time which require\r\nnotice for our purpose.\r\n\r\nThese are the Apocrypha[370] of Quintilian, which are, for more reasons\r\nthan one, best regarded apart from the _Institutes_. There are, in the\r\nfirst place, the _Declamations_, already referred to[371]—nineteen\r\ncomplete, with sketches, fragments, and skeletons of a much larger\r\nnumber, which even thus falls short of the huge total of nearly four\r\nhundred assigned to him after a fashion. If the whole were written on\r\nthe scale of the score that we possess, they would fill some four\r\nthousand closely printed pages. Interesting, in a fashion, they are; as\r\npointed out above, they supply, with the works of the elder Seneca, our\r\nonly considerable bodies in Latin of that work of the schools which for\r\ncenturies occupied the growing intellects of the two great ancient\r\nliterary nations, and which supplied the never-blunted point of the\r\nsatirist’s\r\n\r\n                “Ut pueris placeas et declamatio fias.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 370:\r\n\r\n  The _Declamations_ were last edited, I think, by Ritter in the Teubner\r\n  Library. That invaluable collection puts (as indeed is usual) the\r\n  _Dialogus_ with the other minor works of Tacitus, ed. Halm. It may\r\n  also be found, with the same company, in the new Oxford _Bibliotheca\r\n  Classicorum_, ed. Furneaux. I use a pretty and convenient joint\r\n  edition of the nineteen complete Declamations and the Dialogue, which\r\n  appeared at Oxford, without editor’s name, in 1692.\r\n\r\nFootnote 371:\r\n\r\n  _V. supra_, p. 230 _sq._\r\n\r\nSeneca has been treated already in his proper place. The\r\nPseudo-Quintilian (for there is hardly a page of the _Declamations_\r\nwhich does not fly in the face of the _Institutes_) gives us speeches,\r\nadjusted to the strict canons of _status_ and the rest, written in the\r\nwell-known style of the Ciceronian superlative (one wonders that, simply\r\nto save breath and time, the bar of Rome did not agree that any one who\r\nsaid _-issimus_ should be sconced an amphora, or, if that seem\r\nexcessive, at least a _congius_), extremely ingenious now and then, but\r\nof the most fantastic and arbitrary quality. The chief interest of them,\r\nat least from our point of view, is, that in the mere reading one\r\nunderstands how impossible it was that attention to such things should\r\nconsist with attention to true literary criticism.\r\n\r\nThe _Dialogus de Claris Oratoribus_, traditionally ascribed to Tacitus,\r\nthough some will have it to be nothing less than the [Sidenote: _The_\r\nDialogus de Claris Oratoribus.] otherwise lost _De Causis corruptæ\r\nEloquentiæ_ which Quintilian, as we know from himself, certainly wrote,\r\nis a much more meritorious performance. The style is very unlike[372]\r\nthat of the surely unmistakable author of the _Germania_ and the\r\n_Annals_, the method does not seem, to me at least, after a good deal of\r\nstudy of Quintilian, to be his. But it is very likely about their date,\r\nand by no contemptible author. The opening certainly chimes in not ill\r\nwith the title of Quintilian’s missing treatise. A certain Justus\r\nFalinus had asked why, after the magnificent crops of oratory which\r\nformer ages had yielded, the very name of _orator_ had almost died out,\r\nand had been supplanted by “counsel”[373] and “advocate” and “patron.”\r\nThe author replies, with a due Ciceronianism, that he had better rub up\r\nhis memory of a remarkable conversation on the subject heard in his\r\nyouth. Curiatius Maternus, both poet and orator, had recited a tragedy\r\non Cato which excited the town nearly as much as another piece of the\r\nsame name sixteen hundred years later; and Marcus Aper, a man of Gaulish\r\norigin, consular rank, and great fame, and Julius Secundus, met (with\r\nthe writer) at Maternus’ house to talk over it. The first of these\r\nrather despised literature, relying on mother-wit; the second was said\r\nto be indebted more to art than to nature: but both were among the\r\nleading counsel of their day. Secundus gently suggests that Cato is a\r\ndangerous subject, and Maternus says that he has another tragedy in hand\r\n(_Thyestes_) with which to follow it. Then Aper opens fire upon him:\r\nfirst, for deserting oratory and the bar for idle play-writing;\r\nsecondly, for choosing foolish fancy subjects like Thyestes. Maternus\r\nappeals to Secundus. He is accustomed to Aper’s denunciations of poetry.\r\nWill not Secundus act as judge? Secundus says that he is not quite\r\nimpartial because of his friendship for Saleius Bassus (a contemporary\r\nepic poet of whom we hear in Quintilian as a particular friend of his).\r\nOh, says Aper, let Bassus and others, who cannot compass oratory,\r\ncultivate poetry if they like. Here is Maternus who can: so he is\r\nwasting his time. And he embarks on a warm and by no means ineloquent\r\neulogy of eloquence from its practical side, urging not merely its great\r\npolitical importance but other points. Eloquence opens positions of\r\nopulence and power, makes you valuable to your friends and the State, is\r\na safeguard to yourself, gives fame, wealth, dignity. As for poetry, it\r\nbrings none of these things. It is of no use, and the pleasure it gives\r\nis short, idle, and unprofitable. What is the good of it? Who thinks\r\nmuch even of Bassus himself? And if he or his friends are in any\r\ndifficulty, to whom will they go? Why, to an orator. The poet spends an\r\ninfinity of labour on his poem, compasses heaven and earth to whip an\r\naudience together, and gets nothing from it. Certainly Vespasian did\r\ngive Bassus five hundred sestertia, and very noble it was of him; but\r\nthis was mere alms. An orator _earns_ his money. Besides, your poets\r\nhave to skulk in the country, and even if they stay in town, who cares\r\nabout them, or goes to see them? Of course, as before said, if a man\r\ncannot be an orator, why, let him be a poet. But eloquence is as great a\r\nthing from the merely literary point of view, and far more useful.\r\n\r\nFootnote 372:\r\n\r\n  I say this in some fear and trembling, with such an authority as the\r\n  late Mr Nettleship against me. But I have been accustomed for a good\r\n  many years to compare styles in more languages than one or two, and I\r\n  think these most unlike. Even the argument that a man may suit his\r\n  style to his work is not conclusive, for here it is the _general_\r\n  unlikeness of tone and flavour, which cannot be wholly disguised, that\r\n  decides me.\r\n\r\nFootnote 373:\r\n\r\n  _Causidici._\r\n\r\nMaternus takes this diatribe quite coolly, and replies readily enough.\r\nHe has had some little experience, he says, and some little fame in both\r\noratory and poetry: he does not care for the publicity (so precious to\r\nAper) which the former brings, and, holding the contrary opinion to his\r\nfriend’s, he thinks the country life far higher and better than that of\r\nthe town. The great poets of old, if you reckon mere fame, are at least\r\nthe equals of the orators, and (here we come to another point of contact\r\nwith Quintilian) there are more nowadays who run down Cicero than\r\nVirgil. The unquiet and anxious life of the orator has no charms for\r\nhim. He wants neither more money nor more power: and he would have\r\nhimself figured on his tomb, not serious and frowning, but merry and\r\ncrowned. At the peroration of Maternus comes in Vipsanius[374] Messalla,\r\nwho, being informed by Secundus of the nature of the dispute, expresses\r\nhis approval of it, but hints a strong preference for the _older_\r\norators. Aper catches this up rather hotly, after his manner: and after\r\na little general conversation puts the obvious _aporia_, Who _are_ the\r\nold orators? running over the history of Roman oratory, with some not\r\nuninteresting criticisms, and a strong contention in favour of his own\r\ncontemporaries. Maternus and Messalla take up the same matter from other\r\nsides, and the dialogue ends.\r\n\r\nFootnote 374:\r\n\r\n  Or Vipstanus, as they read now.\r\n\r\nThis piece at first promises considerably, and it cannot be said to\r\nperform badly in any place; but its conclusion and middle part are of\r\nless importance to us than seemed likely at the beginning. The\r\npanegyrics of Oratory and Poetry respectively, in which Aper and\r\nMaternus indulge, might well have led to a fuller and more searching\r\nanalysis of the respective literary merits of the two—instead of which\r\nwe have from Aper only a rather Philistine exaltation of the superior\r\nuse and profit of oratory, from Maternus a generous, but slightly vague\r\nand rhetorical, exaltation of the qualities of poetry and the delights\r\nof the poet. From the entrance of Messalla the piece becomes little more\r\nthan a contribution to the everlasting ancient-and-modern quarrel on the\r\none hand, and to the history of Roman oratory on the other. Yet in Aper,\r\nat least, we have a vigorous projection of the positive Roman spirit,\r\ncombined with a fancy for pregnant and precious style; in Maternus, an\r\nindication of that mainly dilettante and bookish temper which the\r\nsatirists blame in their literary, and especially their poetical,\r\ncontemporaries; and in Messalla (who is taken by the partisans of the\r\nTacitean authorship to represent Tacitus himself), an instance of that\r\nlooking back to better times which is, at any rate sometimes, if not\r\ninvariably, a token of literary decadence.\r\n\r\nHere again, as in the case of Cicero, it is necessary to break the rule\r\nof not entering upon controversy, lest by silence one [Sidenote: _Mr\r\nNettleship’s estimate of it._] incur the blame of neglecting more than\r\ncompetent authority. As in that other case, Mr Nettleship’s estimate of\r\nthe critical value of the _Dialogus_ (which he unhesitatingly attributes\r\nto Tacitus) is higher, though not so much higher, than mine. He ranks it\r\nwith, but above, the _Brutus_, as “the two great documents of Latin\r\ncriticism”: I should put both as such (though Cicero and Tacitus were\r\nboth of them far cleverer than Quintilian) below the _Institutes_, and\r\nalso below other things.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the difference somewhat consoles me for the fact. Mr\r\nNettleship was evidently bitten with that noble error, the belief that\r\ncriticism of literature must be criticism of something that is _not_\r\nliterature. Tacitus seems to him to ask “under what social conditions\r\ngreat writing and great speaking arise,”—a most interesting question,\r\nbut an excursus from criticism proper. “He sees clearly, and this is the\r\nimportant point which characterises the treatise, that literature must\r\nbe taken and judged as the expression of national life, not as a matter\r\nof form and of scholastic teaching.”\r\n\r\nFor “scholastic teaching” so be it: that also is extraneous to the\r\ncentral matter. But on the other point one must throw away the scabbard.\r\nNever will literature be judged adequately—seldom will it be, even\r\nwithin limits, judged accurately—as “an expression of national life.”\r\nFrom this and kindred fallacies come, and always have come, a brood of\r\nmonsters, the folly, almost as great as its opposite, that “a poet must\r\nbe a good man,” the folly that you can judge literature by remembering\r\nthat there is much water-meadow in England[375]—hundreds of others. That\r\nliterature is an expression of national life nobody need deny—that\r\nnational life can never be estimated without an estimate of literature\r\nis, if anything, still more true. But literature is first of all\r\nliterature, and it must be judged, like all other things, by the laws of\r\nits essence, and not by the laws of even its inseparable accidents.\r\n\r\nFootnote 375:\r\n\r\n  Those who have an accurate memory of M. Taine’s _English Literature_\r\n  and of his _English Notes_ will not object to this apparent\r\n  impossibility.\r\n\r\nHow different was Mr Nettleship’s point of view may be judged from the\r\nmere fact that he actually passes over the first fifteen chapters, which\r\nto me seem to contain most of the literary criticism of the piece. Nor\r\ncan I (though he himself fully admits the oratorical preoccupation both\r\nhere and still more in Cicero) help thinking that the substitution of\r\nthe English “style” for “eloquentia” and “oratio” amounts to a certain\r\nbegging of the question. Much that is true of the orator is no doubt\r\nalso true of the writer, but not all: and the connection with life, with\r\npublic national life, on which such stress is here laid, undoubtedly\r\napplies to oratory, whether of the pulpit, the senate-house, or the bar,\r\nfar more than it applies to books. The most _literary_ side of oratory\r\n(I am not ashamed to make the concession) is the lowest—that of pure\r\nepideictic. But then, that is because oratory is, after all, only\r\napplied, not pure literature.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, from this interesting piece, almost as much as from the\r\npoets and Pliny, that the age was, so to say, poly-historic [Sidenote:\r\n_The general literary taste of the Silver Age._] rather than original,\r\nand that, while it was no stranger to the very sound opinion that the\r\ngoodness of a thing must be measured in its own kind, it still had not\r\ncleared up its mind about the relative value of different kinds.\r\nAlthough oratory had, with the rarest exceptions, become the mere art of\r\nthe advocate, or the mere business of the travelling or resident\r\nrhetorician, it still had a most disproportionate position. Although the\r\nsatirist laughed at the custom of writing artificial Greek epics and\r\ntragedies, it is clear that these still held the highest place in the\r\ngeneral opinion. The bilingual practice, not merely in these but in\r\nother kinds, of itself inferred a certain lack of “race,” vernacularity,\r\ngenuineness, in either literature. Some kinds of letters were still\r\nhardly known; Pliny’s own indulgent reference to _fabellæ_ is all the\r\nmore interesting that we are not so very far from the _Lucius_ and the\r\n_Golden Ass_. In almost all departments odd conventions and assumptions\r\nprevailed, such as the necessity of loose subjects, and even of coarse\r\nlanguage, in _vers de société_. And it was probably the working of this,\r\nand of the strict ideas as to certain forms and their laws, that caused\r\nthe jack-of-all-trade tendency to which we have more than once referred.\r\nIf the rules are pretty clearly laid down, and if you are a man of\r\nreasonable learning and intelligence, attention to such rules will\r\nsecure success. There is no reason why as Pliny himself seems to have\r\nthought in his own case and the cases of many of his friends, you should\r\nnot be at once an orator and a historian, an epic poet and a comic, a\r\ndramatist and an epigram-writer. And the age still believed devoutly in\r\nthe rules, though free-lances like Martial might kick at them in verse,\r\nand though Quintilian, with his unfailing good sense, might hint that\r\nthere were far too many Figures, and that the subdivisions of Greek\r\nrhetoric were in many cases idle.\r\n\r\nIn nothing, perhaps, is this tendency of ancient criticism better shown\r\nthan in its attitude to the question of Faultlessness. [Sidenote:\r\n“_Faultlessness._”] Of course, on this question there were two parties,\r\nwith many subdivisions in each. There were the extreme classics of that\r\nclassic time, the wooden persons of whom Martial tells us, for whom it\r\nwas enough if a thing was not “correct,” to whom a fault was a\r\nfault—indelible, incompensable, to be judged off-hand and Draconically.\r\nAnd at the other side there were the sensible persons, like Quintilian,\r\nlike Pliny, like Martial himself (not to mention Longinus, whom some\r\nwould have to be their contemporary), who contended that faults might be\r\nmade up by beauties, who sneered at _mere_ “faultlessness.” But no one,\r\nnot Longinus himself, seems to have taken up the position which the\r\nboldest and most consistent (it would be question-begging to say the\r\nbest) modern critics take, that the whole calculus is wrong—that this\r\nnotion of “faults” made up by “beauties,” of a balance-sheet, debtor and\r\ncreditor, with the result struck one way or the other, is wholly a\r\nmisconception. Two, I suppose, of the most representative passages in\r\nEnglish poetry touching this subject are Lear’s apostrophe to the\r\nelements, and Milton’s episode of Sin and Death. The extreme stop-watch\r\nand foot-rule critics of the first century, like those of the\r\neighteenth, and, perhaps, some (though they are not a prevailing party)\r\neven at the present day would call these undoubted faults, both of them\r\nsinning against the law or conception of measure in language, and the\r\nsecond offending still more gravely against that or those of decency,\r\npropriety, the becoming, in imagery, subject, language. The defenders,\r\nor those who might have been the defenders, of Shakespeare and Milton,\r\nfrom the other point of view, would admit in varying degrees that the\r\nthings were faulty; but would urge the pathos of the first, the gloomy\r\nmagnificence of the second, the force and power and grandeur of both, as\r\n_redeeming_ them—in a degree and to an extent again varying with the\r\nindividual critic.\r\n\r\nNow, a thoroughgoing “Romantic” and comparative critic of the modern\r\ntype, while he would, of course, scout the first party, would be loath\r\nto adopt either the method or the exact conclusions of the second. “Let\r\nus clear our minds of cant,” he would say. “These things are not\r\n‘faults’ at all. They do not leave the court pardoned on consideration\r\nof the previous or subsequent good behaviour of the culprit, but simply\r\nbecause there is no stain on his or their character. There is no need to\r\nplead extenuating circumstances: we stand for acquittal _sans phrase_.\r\nThese things might be faults elsewhere, in other poems: they are not so\r\nhere. They are the absolutely right things in the right place, producing\r\nthe right effect, driven home by the right power to the right mark.\r\nShakespeare and Milton _have_ faults—the somewhat excessive tendency of\r\nthe first to play on words out of season as well as in, and the\r\ndeplorable propensity of the second to joke when joking was absolutely\r\nimpossible to him. But these are not of the character of the Longinian\r\nor Quintilianian ‘fault’ at all. They do not endear the poets; they make\r\nthem less good; we wish they _were_ faultless in this sense. Your\r\n‘faultlessness’ simply means that the man has that most hopeless of all\r\nfaults—mediocrity: and your ‘fault’ is simply derived from the existence\r\nin your mind of a more or less complicated set of rules which have no\r\nreal existence. Nay,” he might proceed, “the extremest classical men are\r\nsounder in a way than you are. They are right in thinking that a fault\r\n_is_ a fault, and can never be ‘redeemed,’ much less purged, by a\r\nbeauty. They are only wrong in not knowing what beauties or what faults\r\nreally are.”\r\n\r\nNow, I do not say whether the criticism of antiquity was right or wrong\r\nin not taking this view. But I think there is absolutely no evidence\r\nthat it was ever taken at this time.\r\n\r\nIn some other agreements and differences we find ourselves more at home.\r\nThe everlasting questions of archaic or modern [Sidenote: _Ornate or\r\nplain style._] language, of conceited or direct thought, of ornate or\r\nplain style, occupied the critics of the end of the first and the\r\nbeginning of the second century, just as they have occupied those of\r\nmore recent pasts, are occupying those of the present, and will occupy\r\nthose of the future. As has been indicated in detail, there was not here\r\nquite the critical unanimity which some periods have shown on these and\r\nsimilar questions. Among the general there was something like an\r\nagreement; it seems undeniable that the popular taste of Roman audiences\r\nat recitations ran towards elaborate and slightly archaic phraseology,\r\nto Greek literary subjects, and (both in verse-epics and tragedies and\r\nin prose declamations) to topsy-turvy conceit. This was evidently\r\nfrequent in verse, though time has carried away most traces of it; and\r\nin prose it is not entirely alien from the magnificent phrase-making of\r\nTacitus, it shows itself amply in the rhetoric of Seneca the son, as in\r\nthe earlier rhetorical examples of Seneca the father, is almost openly\r\ndefended by Pliny, and seems to receive a certain amount of “colour” (as\r\nthe rhetoricians themselves would have said) even from some passages of\r\nQuintilian. It is very noteworthy that all these prose-writers incline\r\nmore or less to the artificial side, while the verse-satirists argue and\r\nsally for terseness, elegance, concinnity. And the cause may not\r\nimprobably be sought in those very declamations of which mention has\r\nbeen so often made. We have no enormous stock of them, which is not to\r\nbe regretted; but in the surviving examples we have material which is\r\nwelcome in its way, and which amply proves what has been said.[376]\r\n\r\nFootnote 376:\r\n\r\n  I am not sure that I should have given any place here to Cornelius\r\n  Fronto, if his ticket of admission had not been (rather\r\n  contumeliously) countersigned by Mr Nettleship. The low opinion which\r\n  Marcus Aurelius seems to have had of literature may possibly have been\r\n  in part excused by his preceptor’s utterances on the subject. He\r\n  appears to have been an eminent representative of the “labelling”\r\n  school of critics. Lucilius is “gracile” (this is not quite Horace’s\r\n  view), Albucius and Pacuvius mediocre, Accius unequal, Ennius\r\n  multiform. Sallust writes history _structe_, Pictor _incondite_,\r\n  Claudius _lepide_, Antias _invenuste_, Sisenna _longinque_, Cato\r\n  _verbis multijugis_, Cœlius _singulis_. One cannot help “nodding\r\n  approval and saying, ‘This is very satisfactory to know,’” as Lady Kew\r\n  did when she was informed that “Alfred was a trump, and Ethel a brick,\r\n  and Barnes a snob.” But if Mr Nettleship thought that æsthetic, as\r\n  opposed to philosophical, criticism could not get beyond this system\r\n  of tickets-of-leave, he was surely mistaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                              QUINTILIAN.\r\n\r\nTHE ‘INSTITUTES’—PREFACE—BOOK I.: ELEMENTARY EDUCATION AND\r\n    GRAMMAR—BOOKS II.-VII.

AND XII.—THE\r\n    STYLES OF ORATORY—\"ATTICISM\"—LITERARY QUALITY OF GREEK AND\r\n    LATIN—QUINTILIAN’S CRITICAL “ETHOS.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn passing, say, from Cicero, the chief prose Latin critic of\r\npræ-Augustan times, to Quintilian, the chief of post-Augustan, and\r\n[Sidenote: _The_ Institutes.] indeed of Latin critics of all dates, we\r\ncome to a man of much less genius no doubt, and, in particular, of far\r\nless creative literary power, but still to one who, for our special\r\npurpose, has some very considerable advantages. It is not merely that\r\nthe Spanish-Roman is a professional critic, as well as a\r\nrhetorician—that he is as much _the_ professional critic of Latin as\r\nDionysius of Halicarnassus (whom he much resembles, and to whom, as has\r\nbeen said, he possibly owes not a little) is of Greek. He has over the\r\ngreater writer (whom he admires so generously) the further advantage of\r\ncomplete freedom from that touch of dilettantism (one is sometimes\r\nalmost tempted to use a harsher word and call it quackery) which besets\r\nCicero whenever he is not actually pleading or debating, and which is\r\nnot invariably lost even then. Further, Quintilian is the only critic of\r\nantiquity (for even Longinus, as we saw, merely glances at the subject)\r\nwho seriously takes the two languages, seriously compares them, and, by\r\nthe help of the comparison, acquires a view-point over literature as\r\nsuch—not merely as Greek or Latin literature—which was shut to all his\r\npredecessors and most of his followers. If the _Rhetoric_ and the\r\n_Poetics_ of Aristotle form the great book of critical method for\r\nancient times, if the Περὶ Ὕψους is the great book of their critical\r\ninspiration; the _Institutes of Oratory_ contain the fullest, the most\r\nintelligent, the most satisfactory applications of criticism to\r\nliterature, as it presented itself to an intelligent and thoroughly\r\neducated person, whose eyes were sharpened by long expert use, at the\r\nend of the first century, when, except for a few belated authors, mostly\r\nof curiosities, the list of the great writers of antiquity was all but\r\nclosed. The book[377] is extremely well written; it is, with a few\r\n_cruces_, remarkably clear, and its range and thoroughness leave\r\npractically nothing to desire.\r\n\r\nFootnote 377:\r\n\r\n  Whether its correct title be _Institutiones Oratoriæ_, or _De\r\n  Institutione Oratoria_, and whether this be better translated\r\n  _Principles of Oratory_, or _Of the Education of an Orator_, are\r\n  questions not very important _to us_. The sense of “Institutes” may be\r\n  illustrated by the old division of academical chairs in, for instance,\r\n  Medicine into “Institutes” (_i.e._, “Theory”) and “Practice.” But\r\n  Quintilian includes a good deal of the practical side. All the\r\n  editions of Quintilian are either antiquated by, or more or less based\r\n  upon, that of Spalding and Zumpt, with Lexicon, &c., by Bonnell,\r\n  Leipsic, 1798-1834. I find the little Tauchnitz print of the text\r\n  (ibid., 1829) very useful. The Bohn translation, by the ill-starred J.\r\n  S. Watson, though not impeccable, will serve English readers well\r\n  enough.\r\n\r\nThis wide range of it (which, according to different, but, in each case,\r\ndefensible interpretations of its title, busies itself with the whole\r\neducation of an orator, or with the whole theory and practice of\r\noratory) naturally makes it include much which does not fall strictly\r\nwithin our subject. But nearly the whole of three books, the eighth,\r\nninth, and tenth, and a large and important section of the twelfth, are\r\ndevoted directly to that subject; while there are references to it\r\nalmost throughout. We shall therefore, as we did in the case of\r\nAristotle and Longinus, give a kind of running abstract of the whole,\r\ndwelling very briefly on the irrelevant, somewhat more fully on the\r\npartly relevant, fully on the rest, and returning to the consideration\r\nof special points later.\r\n\r\nIn a sort of Advertisement, to and for the use of his publisher Trypho,\r\nand in a prefatory dedication to his friend Marcellus [Sidenote:\r\n_Preface._] Victorius, Quintilian gives some information about the\r\norigin and object of the work. From this we learn, among other things,\r\nthat part-cause at least of its actual appearance was the fact, not\r\nunknown in more modern times, of unauthorised publication of his\r\nlectures by note-taking pupils.\r\n\r\nThe first book is devoted to the subject of the education of boys from\r\nthe earliest age, a subject on which Quintilian speaks [Sidenote: _Book\r\nI. Elementary Education_] with much knowledge and good sense, as well as\r\nkindliness. But from this he soon passes to Grammar, and his importance\r\nfor us begins. For his treatment of the subject is quite in the larger\r\nand humaner sense, insisting from the first on critical reading, though\r\nhe seems, as indeed we should expect, to regard the “desperate hook” of\r\nthe extremer kind of verbal critic with little favour. It is noteworthy\r\nthat he alleges music to be necessary, because the grammarian has to\r\nspeak of metre and rhythm. And passing rapidly from considerations of\r\northography, right pronunciation, and audience, he arrives at the\r\nall-important subject of “correctness,” and of its attainment,\r\nnegatively by the avoidance of barbarisms and solecisms, positively by\r\nthe selection of the best words in the best arrangement. Observations of\r\nspecial importance in this context may be cited: That the word in itself\r\n(_i.e._, out of connection) has no merit except its inherent euphony;\r\nthat (a most pregnant remark) it is often difficult to distinguish\r\nFaults from Figures of speech; and some exceedingly [Sidenote: _and\r\nGrammar._] interesting, but also more than ordinarily difficult, remarks\r\non tone and accent-variation. In all these grammatical notes, which are\r\npretty full and numerous, and often very curious—showing that, as he\r\nhimself says pleasantly, though he is not writing a treatise on Grammar,\r\nyet as it lay in his way he did not like not to be polite to it—there is\r\na pervading quality of not at all Philistine common-sense which shows\r\nthe best side of the Roman temperament. Although Quintilian acknowledges\r\nthe convenience of Greek for terminology, and makes fairly free use of\r\nthe terms, it is quite evident that he has (long before he formulates it\r\nlater) a profound and very wholesome distrust of the Greek rhetorical\r\npractice of splitting a thing up, naming the splinters, and then passing\r\non, as if a real, solid, and final examination had been attained. And\r\nthe same quality appears eminently in the summing up of his discourse on\r\nwords, “Custom in speaking I shall call the agreement of the educated,\r\nas custom in living is the agreement of the good.”\r\n\r\nRemarks on orthography follow, and some on reading, valuable, though not\r\nso valuable, as those on the same [Sidenote: _Books II.-VII. only\r\nrelevant now and then._] subject which come later. And then he passes to\r\ncertain of the _progymnasmata_ of the Greek rhetoricians, fables, uses,\r\nsentences, and “ethologies,” which, though they have puzzled some, are\r\nclearly the same as the _ethopœiæ_ of Hermogenes and his\r\nfellows.[378] All these are, in fact, exercises in composition. The rest\r\nof the book is occupied with the discussion of other subjects of the\r\nschool curriculum, subsidiary to rhetoric. The second book continues the\r\nsubject of Composition, but with more special reference to Oratory\r\nproper—a tendency which naturally increases; and for some five or six\r\nbooks the technicalities of the rhetoric-school and the courts have the\r\nbetter of literature. There are, however, two exceptions, which require\r\nnotice—the first a remarkable passage[379] on reading or lecturing on\r\nauthors.\r\n\r\nFootnote 378:\r\n\r\n  For these technical terms _v. ante_, bk. i. chap. iv., or the Index.\r\n\r\nFootnote 379:\r\n\r\n  II. v. 5-9.\r\n\r\n“But”—he has just ruled out the explanation of the mere meaning of\r\nuncommon words as below the duties of a Professor of Rhetoric—\"to point\r\nout the merits, and if it so happen, the faults, is the properest of all\r\nthings for the profession and for the promise by which he holds himself\r\nout as a master of eloquence....\" (He should make the students read in\r\nturn, and then), \"after setting forth the case on which the oration was\r\ncomposed (for thus it will be more clearly understood), he should leave\r\nnothing unnoticed which may be noteworthy in the invention or the\r\nelocution, pointing out the manner of conciliating the jury in the\r\nproem, the clearness, conciseness, persuasive force of the narration,\r\nthe occasional design and hidden artifice (for that alone is true art\r\nhere, which can only be understood by an artist), what foresight there\r\nis in division, what subtle and thronging[380] argumentation, the\r\nstrength of the inspiration, the attraction of the winning passages, the\r\nroughness[381] of the objurgation, and the humour of the jokes; how,\r\nfinally, the man [Sidenote: _How to lecture on an author._] shows\r\nmastery of feeling, makes his way into the very heart, and adjusts the\r\nminds of the jury to his own contention. Then, as for style, we must\r\npoint out what words are proper, ornate, sublime, where the\r\namplification is to be praised, what excellence there is in the contrary\r\ndirection,[382] what is ingeniously transferred; what the figurativeness\r\nof the words is, how smooth and squared, yet manly, the composition.\"\r\nAnd then he proceeds to recommend the occasional selection of passages\r\nwhich are not to be praised—the exhibition, in short, of a rhetorical\r\nhelotry.\r\n\r\nFootnote 380:\r\n\r\n  _Crebra_, as it were “attacking on all sides,” “redoubling blows.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 381:\r\n\r\n  _Asperitas_, which some would rather translate “trenchancy.” But there\r\n  was an idea in ancient times (not quite unknown in modern) that in\r\n  hostile argument politeness (“treating your adversary with respect,”\r\n  as Johnson said) was out of place.\r\n\r\nFootnote 382:\r\n\r\n  _Quæ virtus ei contraria_, that is to say, I suppose, brevity and\r\n  pregnancy. “Transferred” just below, in the sense of _translatio_,\r\n  “metaphor,” “what ingenuity of metaphor.”\r\n\r\nNo reader, I hope, will need to have it pointed out to him, at any great\r\nlength, how exactly this corresponds to the practice of the critical\r\nlecturer or reviewer, as it ought to be, in regard to all kinds of\r\nliterature, and not oratory merely. Such a lecturer, or such a reviewer,\r\ncan do no better than grave these words of Quintilian on his mind, and\r\nfollow their directions as best he can, whensoever an author is to be\r\nexpounded on the platform or reviewed in the column. It scarcely\r\nrequires more than the easiest and most obvious substitutions and\r\namplifications to make the passage a manual in miniature of all\r\ncriticism, be it of prose or poetry.\r\n\r\nThe other passage is the very curious and interesting section in the\r\nthird chapter of the Sixth book, on Wit.[383] As is well known, this is\r\none of the points on which ancient (especially Latin) and modern taste\r\nare most out of harmony. Except [Sidenote: _Wit._] Aristophanes at one\r\nend, with his alternations of outrageous farce and keen poetry, and\r\nLucian at the other, with the innocent-seeming flow of his white-hot\r\nirony, there are perhaps not even any Greek authors whose command of our\r\nrisibility is absolutely sure; and the average Greek joke, as reported\r\nby the anecdote-mongers, is to us but a vapid thing. In Latin it is even\r\nworse. Plautus pretty generally, but in a limited way; Catullus, when he\r\nexchanges passion for humour; sometimes Horace, for a pleasant Augustan\r\n“wit of the town”; Martial for a too often naughty _persiflage_,—these\r\nwe have little doubt about. But Terence, even if we shut our eyes to his\r\nborrowed capital, is but comedy-and-water; Cicero jokes without indeed\r\nmuch difficulty on his part, but with surprisingly little effect on\r\nours; and the _average_ Latin jest is far worse than the average Greek.\r\nOf course this is all natural enough; the jest always, save in certain\r\ntranscendences, lies more in the ear of the hearer than the charm or\r\nquality of any other kind of literature. But it is all the more\r\ninteresting and valuable to have a set discussion on the comic by a man\r\nof immense reading, excellent taste, and great acuteness. Besides,\r\nQuintilian’s Spanish blood or birth may very likely have given him a\r\nsomewhat wider and more flexible appreciation of humour than the “firm\r\nRoman” wit itself allowed, or at least encouraged.\r\n\r\nFootnote 383:\r\n\r\n  _Virtus quæ risum judicis movet_, VI. iii.\r\n\r\nAfter mentioning, as a generally accepted thing, the deficiency of the\r\ncomic element in Demosthenes, and the superabundant quantity and\r\ninferior quality of it in Cicero (it must be remembered that Quintilian\r\nhad the Tullian _Three Books of Jests_, which time has mercifully hidden\r\nfrom us), he passes to the general question, and accepts the almost\r\nuniversal classical opinion that laughter has always something low about\r\nit.[384] In this, we know, Plato and Aristotle both agreed; it was a\r\nsort of postulate of all Greek philosophy, and though almost certainly\r\nfalse, was excused, partly by the extreme licence of the Comic Muse in\r\nancient times, and partly by the rarity of humour in the best sense, and\r\nthe almost non-existence of Romantic Comedy. He observes, however,\r\nacutely enough, on the insufficiency of the general explanations of the\r\norigin of laughter (an insufficiency which has certainly not been filled\r\nup to the present day), and shows that urbane shrewdness, which is one\r\nof his best points, by questioning whether deliberate cultivation of\r\njesting as an art is an altogether satisfactory thing. But it is in his\r\nsubsequent remarks on the kind of jesting admissible in oratory (we\r\nmight here at least substitute, with hardly any wrong, “in literature”)\r\nthat his chief merit lies. On the dangerous business of verbal\r\ndistinction between _venustum_, _salsum_, _facetum_ he is luminous and\r\nuseful; while his remarks, in two different places, on _urbanitas_ are\r\nnot far from a _locus classicus_, and those[385] on the special treatise\r\nof Domitius Marsus on that topic have the best qualities of a\r\nreview—that is to say, of the kind of review that one sees too seldom.\r\n\r\nFootnote 384:\r\n\r\n  _Hoc semper humile._\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, till the eighth book is reached (for the seventh,\r\nexcept in some remarks on arrangement, is almost [Sidenote: _Book VIII.:\r\nStyle._] purely legal) that we find Quintilian, for a considerable time,\r\nat close quarters with our special subject. After summarising with\r\nremarkable clearness (so that there is nowhere any better conspectus, in\r\nlittle, of the matter) the earlier and technically rhetorical part of\r\nthe _Institutes_, he comes to the third part, which he calls\r\n“elocution.”[386] This is no other than the _lexis_, which Aristotle\r\ntreats not indeed perfunctorily (it was not in Aristotle to be guilty of\r\nthat crime), but with a sort of apologetic impatience, as one turning\r\nback to the Court of the Gentiles after visiting the Holy of Holies. The\r\npoint of view, with some four hundred years of great work, not merely in\r\noratory, but in general literature, behind the critic, and with the new\r\nrequirement of comparison between Greek and Latin brought in, has\r\nchanged remarkably. Instead of a popular and slightly vulgar appendix,\r\nit is (Quintilian tells us that all orators agreed with him) the most\r\ndifficult part of the subject. At the same time, he has not attained to\r\nthe almost perfect _parrhesia_ of Longinus; he dares not tell us (though\r\nwe can see that he was sometimes half minded to do so) that “beautiful\r\nwords are the light of thought.” He has the stereotyped caution—very\r\nwholesome in its way—to those who neglect things and attend to words.\r\nBut he will not allow words to be neglected in their turn, and as a\r\nmatter of fact perhaps the greater, certainly the most interesting and\r\noriginal, part of the five books which follow is occupied with what,\r\ndisguise itself as it may under the term of “elocution,” is really\r\n“style.” Not, be it added, the mere fritter and foppery which sometimes\r\nreceives that name, but literary manner and art in the great and wide\r\nsense—the proper subject, that is to say, of literary criticism.\r\n\r\nFootnote 385:\r\n\r\n  §§ 101-112.\r\n\r\nFootnote 386:\r\n\r\n  Some moderns (notably Campbell in his _Philosophy of Rhetoric_) have\r\n  followed Quintilian in this use of the word for “style.” But the\r\n  accepted sense in English is too well settled for this to be\r\n  permissible.\r\n\r\nAfter this proem, Quintilian begins regularly on the subject—φράσις in\r\nGreek, _elocutio_ in Latin—referring to his remarks [Sidenote:\r\n_Perspicuity._] in the first book (_vide supra_) on the avoidance of\r\nBarbarism and Solecism, and glancing at Livy’s Patavinity, and at the\r\nalleged over-Atticism of Theophrastus. He has, however, a good deal more\r\nto say on the actual lexicon; and in the course of it sharply\r\nperstringes that sort of affected periphrasis which the eighteenth\r\ncentury (though it thought it knew its Quintilian) so dearly loved. “The\r\nIberian shrub” for “broom,” the “fishes solidified by brine” which he\r\nlaughs at, are Thomson in his worst mood, Armstrong, Mason, even\r\nWordsworth at times, to the very life, and Delille to more than the\r\nlife—of which there is not much in that famous Abbé. The necessity of\r\nmaking the epithet fit the noun is excellently inculcated; the use of\r\narchaic technical terms not excessively denounced. But I grieve that\r\nQuintilian joins the herd in condemning Parenthesis, a heavenly maid\r\nwhom there have been many and great ones, from Herodotus to De Quincey,\r\nto love, but whom few have dared to praise as she deserves. It is true\r\nthat she speaks chiefly to the sapient; and the insipient accordingly do\r\nnot love her.\r\n\r\nPassing from perspicuity to “elegance,” as our own eighteenth-century\r\nrhetoricians would have said, Quintilian is equally admirable; but, as\r\nbefore, a certain amount of “hedging” is perceptible in him. True\r\nbeauty, he thinks, is never separable [Sidenote: _Elegance._] from\r\nutility. It is a noble sentiment, and to a very large extent a true one;\r\nbut it may be questioned whether the greatest part of its truth is not\r\nesoteric—whether it does not arise from the suppressed rider, “because\r\ntrue beauty, in merely being beautiful, _is_ of the highest utility.”\r\n\r\nHe himself, however, perhaps did not care to penetrate so far with his\r\nanalysis; at any rate he does not, and so he rather beats about the\r\nbush. Grace of style will captivate; all the great men, Aristotle no\r\nless than Cicero, say that we ought to excite admiration. Only we must\r\nbe “manly, sir, manly”; our embellishment must not be effeminate—it must\r\nbe in good taste. The three kinds of oratory, too, will admit of\r\ndifferent degrees—even different kinds of embellishment. Epideictic\r\nalmost demands ostentation of ornament; debating sometimes permits it;\r\nit must be far more cautiously used in forensic speech. Even words must\r\nbe most cautiously chosen—harshness, a touch of the ludicrous, and other\r\neffects, unless they are deliberately invited, must be carefully\r\nshunned. The archaic (from this point of view there is no real\r\ncontradiction with the former, _v. supra_) will add picturesqueness, but\r\nwe must walk warily with it, we must not say _antigerio_ for _valde_.\r\nHere, perhaps, one may presume to differ with Quintilian, who extends\r\nhis condemnation to the beautiful word _ærumna_. He may have been led to\r\ndislike it by that sensitiveness of his ear to the grunt of the “um,”\r\nwhich we shall notice later, but which ought here to have been appeased\r\nby the musical syllables on either side.\r\n\r\nProceeding from individual words to connected speech, he has some\r\ncapital cautions on unlucky conjunctions of words, suggesting double\r\nmeaning—with, however, the still wiser reflection that if you are always\r\nlooking out for this, you had better hold your tongue altogether. A\r\nhandful of the rhetorical tickets—_tapeinosis_,[387] _meiosis_,[388]\r\nHomœology, Macrology, pleonasm, _cacozelon_,[389] and so forth—is\r\ntaken up, and they are shaken out and shown to be at least susceptible\r\nof useful application, while in the passages that follow (the conclusion\r\nof the third chapter) some celebrated _loci_[390] are severally\r\nexamined, with an admirable combination of verbal acuteness and general\r\ngrasp. The shorter fourth chapter deals in the same way with the\r\nfavourite figure of Amplification and its opposite Diminution, as\r\nexemplified in chosen illustrations. Then he turns (and we must remember\r\nthat the turn is not arbitrary nor desultory, but follows the divisions\r\nof the older Rhetoric) to those sentences or _gnomæ_, as the Greeks\r\ntermed them, which had such an effect on ancient audiences, and which,\r\n_mutatis mutandis_, are not without effect on modern readers. We have\r\nseen very recently how the mere trick of what may be called\r\n“topsy-turvyfying” accepted maxims has, not once or twice, but again and\r\nagain, managed to secure an audience.\r\n\r\nFootnote 387:\r\n\r\n  The use of undignified expression, as “a _wart_ of stone” on a\r\n  mountain.\r\n\r\nFootnote 388:\r\n\r\n  Not in its usual equivalence with _litotes_, but in the sense of\r\n  cursory and elliptic reference.\r\n\r\nFootnote 389:\r\n\r\n  Affected excess in _any_ direction, whether ornate or plain.\r\n\r\nFootnote 390:\r\n\r\n  Chiefly from Virgil and Cicero.\r\n\r\nThis section ends with a passage of such weight and importance as\r\ngeneral criticism that we must give it nearly _in extenso_:—\r\n\r\n“But there will be no end to it if I follow out individual forms of\r\ncorrupt taste. It is better to turn to what is more necessary. There are\r\ntwo opposite opinions on this subject; some hardly pay attention to\r\nanything but ‘sentences’—some utterly condemn them; and with neither do\r\nI entirely agree. If sentences are too crowded they get in each other’s\r\nway, just as, with all crops and trees, nothing can grow to a proper\r\nsize if it lacks room. Nor does anything stand out in a picture where\r\nthere is no shading; so that artists, when they deal with many things in\r\none canvas, leave spaces between them lest shade and object fall\r\ntogether. Moreover, this same profusion cuts the style too short; for\r\neach sentence stands by itself,[391] and there is, as it were, a fresh\r\nbeginning after it. Whence the composition becomes too disjointed,\r\nconsisting not of integral members, but of separate scraps, inasmuch as\r\nthese things, each rounded and cut off from the rest, refuse\r\nconjunction.[392] Besides, the colour of the speech becomes, as it were,\r\nspotty with blotches, bright indeed, but too many and too different. For\r\nthough a selvage and fringes of purple, in their proper place, light up\r\nthe gown, a garment speckled with patches of colour is certainly\r\nunbecoming. Wherefore, though these sentences may seem to flash and to\r\nstrike in some sense, yet they are lights which may be likened, not to\r\nflame but to sparks amid smoke: they are not even seen when the whole\r\nspeech is luminous, as the stars themselves cease to be visible in\r\nsunshine. And, rising only with fitful and feeble effort, they are but\r\nunequal, and, as it were, broken, so as to attain neither the admiration\r\ndue to things eminent nor the grace of a close uniformity” (VIII. v.\r\n25-29).\r\n\r\nFootnote 391:\r\n\r\n  _Subsistit_: or perhaps “comes to a halt,” “stops dead.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 392:\r\n\r\n  _Insistere invicem nequeant_: or perhaps “are unable to lean upon each\r\n  other,” “to come close to each other,” “to stand in each other’s\r\n  shoes.”\r\n\r\nThe end of the Eighth book, and the beginning of the Ninth, deal with\r\nthe subject—the all too famous and long-studied [Sidenote: _Books VIII.,\r\nIX.: Tropes and Figures._] subject—of Tropes and Figures, which\r\nQuintilian distinguishes from one another a little artificially, and\r\nwith a kind of confession that the distinction is sometimes\r\ncorrespondent to no real difference. It is not till rather late in his\r\nhandling (IX. i. 22) that he makes that scornful reference to the Greek\r\nabundance in this kind which has been itself more than once referred to\r\nhere. He is bound to say that figures are by no means so numerous as\r\nsome would make them out. Nor have the names, which the Greeks can botch\r\nup at any occasion, the least influence with him.[393] And he is\r\nparticularly earnest in condemning the practice of allotting a Figure to\r\nevery affection of the mind—a practice certainly absurd enough, though\r\nno very unnatural consequence of the constitution of “figures” as real\r\nthings.[394]\r\n\r\nFootnote 393:\r\n\r\n  _Neque enim me movent nomina illa, quæ fingere utique Græcis\r\n  promptissimum est._\r\n\r\nFootnote 394:\r\n\r\n  And, it may be added, pretty closely connected with the mania for\r\n  insisting that literary criticism shall perpetually mix itself up with\r\n  ethics and psychology.\r\n\r\nHe himself, however, is by no means stingy of accepted Tropes and\r\nFigures, though he treats them, with his usual common-sense, as names,\r\nnot things. The first place, in his discussion and enumeration of the\r\nmatter, is occupied as usual by Metaphor, a mode of speech so prevailing\r\nin both senses that, here at least, no objection can be made to its\r\nconstitution into a quasi-entity. He calls it “the most frequent and by\r\nfar the most beautiful,” points out, of course, that it is only Simile\r\nin another and shorter form, and illustrates its kinds by examples in\r\nthe best critical style. He specifies these kinds; but once more _not_\r\nto distinguish for the mere sake o£ distinguishing. In fact, here as\r\nelsewhere, we may notice that Quintilian, half unconsciously, stops\r\nshort at the points where Rhetoric parts company with literary\r\ncriticism, and becomes mere pseudo-science. From Metaphor he goes,\r\ntreating them in the same way, as with all the tropes and figures that\r\nhe mentions, to Synecdoche, Metonymy, Hypallage; and has some good\r\nremarks on the fine but real distinctions between the indulgences in\r\nthese flights and sleights which are, and those which are not,\r\npermissible to the orator, whom he practically identifies with the\r\nprose-writer by contrasting him with the poet. Antonomasia, which is of\r\nthe same family, follows, and then a rather disappointing treatment of\r\nOnomatopœia. One sees here the Roman, and the late Roman, but also\r\nthe yearner after better things, in the observation that “this, which\r\nthe Greeks thought one of the greatest excellences, is scarcely allowed\r\n_us_.” “We do not dare to form a new word,” he says, and tells us that\r\neven the formation of such words, on strict analogy of others, was\r\nscarcely ventured on,[395] and that the inability to compound, which has\r\nso notoriously manifested itself later in her greatest daughter, was\r\nbeginning to appear in Latin. In short, Latin had reached a stationary\r\nstate—the state of the nation _qui cesse de prendre_, if not quite of\r\nthat _qui commence à rendre_. It had to become the picturesque and\r\ndelightful, if perhaps too much crossed and blended, Low Latin of the\r\nDark and Middle Ages before it could recover itself.\r\n\r\nFootnote 395:\r\n\r\n  This famous horror of the _insolens_, the _inusitatum verbum_, is the\r\n  very dominant note of all Latin criticism, and will recur constantly.\r\n\r\nCatachresis, Metalepsis, the ornamental and “perpetual” epithet follow;\r\nand then we come to the fruitful subject of Allegory.\r\n\r\nQuintilian is perhaps not exactly the writer from whom we should expect\r\na thoroughly satisfactory treatment of this great subject—a subject\r\nwhich, far more than metaphor, escapes the state of a mere rhetorical\r\nticket, and challenges that of a real literary quality or kind. Although\r\nit is unjust to represent him as merely conversant in details and afraid\r\nto rise, a certain timidity serves as the Nemesis of his common-sense.\r\nBesides, his materials were not favourable: the great allegorical style\r\nof Plato had long passed, not to be revived; the magnificent exuberance\r\nof mediæval fancy in this kind was far in the future; the exercises\r\nwhich Quintilian had before him were either mere phrases in the poets,\r\ntedious didactic things in the philosophers, or such easy examples as\r\nHorace’s “O navis,” which he quotes. We have therefore no such handling\r\nof the matter as we might have had from Longinus. And when we are told\r\nthat the most ornamental kind of writing by far is that in which the\r\nthree figures—simile, metaphor, and allegory—are mixed, we seem to see\r\nthe worst side of Rhetoric as we seldom do in Quintilian. Once more\r\nthere arises the picture of a dismal sort of library-laboratory, with\r\nbottles and drawers full of ready cold-drawn or ready short-cut\r\nfigures—of the literary dispenser, with his apron on and his balance\r\nadjusted, taking a handful of this, two ounces of that, three drachms of\r\nthe other, and compounding a draught or a pill to be exhibited in the\r\nforum, or the lecture-room, or the courts of justice, as the case may\r\nbe. But he recovers himself soon, if only by the dry fashion in which he\r\nobserves that, if anybody does not know it, the Greeks call certain\r\nkinds of allegory sarcasm, asteism, antiphrasis, and parœmia, to\r\nwhich it may be well to add mycterism,[396] a kind of derision which is\r\ndissembled, but not altogether concealed—as very neatly by M. Fabius\r\nQuintilianus in the passage before us.\r\n\r\nFootnote 396:\r\n\r\n  _I.e._, suppressed sneering.\r\n\r\nPeriphrasis, Hyperbaton, Hyperbole close the chapter, and the book, and\r\nQuintilian shines on the latter, while at the end he refers to his lost\r\ndialogue _On the Causes of the Corruption of Eloquence_, one of the\r\nthings of its kind which we must regret most.\r\n\r\nThe Ninth book opens with the distinction between Trope and Figure,[397]\r\nand with some general remarks on the latter word which illustrate rather\r\namusingly the Delilah-effect of it on those who use it. We should not\r\nhave been sorry to have had that treatise of Apollodorus which\r\nQuintilian seems only to have known through Cæcilius (the writer on the\r\nSublime), and in which the author by no means frivolously argued that,\r\nin the common sense of Figure, everything is a figure, and the\r\nenumeration of figures is impossible and useless. We should have thanked\r\nTime for sparing that other of the Homeromastix, in which Zoilus, with\r\nbetter sense apparently than when he talked of matters too high for him,\r\nlimited the word Figure to a phrase, in which the apparent or first\r\nmeaning is different from the second or real. And Quintilian himself,\r\nwhen he comes to the distinction between Figures of Thought and Figures\r\nof Speech, illustrates (whether purposely or not it is difficult to say)\r\nthe purely childish side of the matter, by remarking that in one of the\r\nVerrines, _jamjam_ and _liberum_ are figures of speech. For, as the\r\ncommentators have gravely worked it out, _jamjam_ is a Palillogia or\r\nrepetition, and _liberum_, contracted from _libeirum_, is an instance of\r\nSyncope. Verily, one exclaims, there is much to be said for Apollodorus!\r\nAnd when he further observes that the greatest power of Figures is to\r\nrender oratory attractive, one feels inclined to say, “The figure is\r\nnothing, and the power of making figures is less; but there _are_\r\nattractive qualities in oratory, and you may ticket them as figures,\r\nwithin moderation, as you like.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 397:\r\n\r\n  _Trope_ = an expression altered from its natural and obvious _sense_.\r\n  _Figure_ = an expression differing in _form_ from the ordinary mode.\r\n\r\nBut it would be a delusion to suppose Quintilian himself deluded.\r\nImmediately after the passage just quoted comes his Declaration of\r\nIndependence in regard to the Greek nomenclature, a fresh observation in\r\nthe same key “to exhibit anger or grief, or any other passion in\r\nliterature, is not of itself to be figurative, though one may use\r\nfigures in the expression,” and—after two quotations from Cicero, in\r\nwhich crowds of figures are introduced and named—a distinct, though\r\ngentle, hint that, much as he admires Cicero, he thinks him too prodigal\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nTwo long chapters, the second and third of the Ninth Book, contain\r\nQuintilian’s own survey of figures as distinguished from tropes, and as\r\ndivided into figures of thought and speech respectively. He opens the\r\nfirst division with Interrogation—the rhetorical interrogation, of\r\ncourse; he goes on to Anticipation (_prolepsis_ in a sense different\r\nfrom the usual one); Feigned Doubt, Communication,[398] Feigned Passion,\r\nProsopopeia, Apostrophe, Hypotyposis, and then regains more open and\r\nhigher ground for a time with the great figure of Irony, of which,\r\nhowever, he makes relatively as little as of Allegory. Aposiopesis,\r\nEthopœia, and Emphasis follow, with something to which he gives no\r\ndefinite name, but which approaches Parable. After this he becomes\r\nrather technically forensic, and winds up with a shower of names of the\r\nverbal hair-splitting kind.\r\n\r\nFootnote 398:\r\n\r\n  In the technical sense of “taking the audience into confidence,” of\r\n  asking the jury what _they_ would do in such a case, &c.\r\n\r\nVerbal figures—\"Figures of Speech\" proper—begin, after some general\r\nremarks, by examples which seem to bring us back to the old conclusion\r\nthat “everything is a figure,” and which are sometimes barely\r\nintelligible, as where _Sthenelus sciens pugnæ_, which seems to us a\r\nmost ordinary expression, is said to show two figures combined.[399] The\r\nFigures themselves, where named distinctly, range from such familiar\r\nthings as Parenthesis and Climax to more technical ones in Epanodos[400]\r\nand Paradiastole.[401] Others, familiar and less familiar, follow, but\r\nat last Quintilian grows impatient, and after plumply denying that\r\nParomologia[402] and Parasiopesis[403] are figures at all, declares\r\nroundly that he shall pay no attention to authors who have made no end\r\nof mere term-seeking, and have classed arguments among Figures. And he\r\nwinds up the whole with a weighty caution against abusing even those\r\nFigures which he has admitted. Of such abuse, almost all times, whether\r\nthey have been devoted to nominated Figures or not, leave more than\r\nsufficient record: but it can never have been more tempting or more\r\nfrequent than when the process of peppering style with the contents of a\r\ncertified chemist’s shop of Figures was almost prescribed by the\r\northodox curriculum of literary education.\r\n\r\nFootnote 399:\r\n\r\n  _Sciens_ being used for _scitus_ and _pugnæ_ for _pugnandi_, and each\r\n  use of one word for another being reckoned as one figure.\r\n\r\nFootnote 400:\r\n\r\n  Deliberate repetition.\r\n\r\nFootnote 401:\r\n\r\n  Antithetic distinction.\r\n\r\nFootnote 402:\r\n\r\n  Concession in order to strengthen argument.\r\n\r\nFootnote 403:\r\n\r\n  Pretended reticence, implying what is meant.\r\n\r\nThe connection, however, with strictly literary criticism becomes closer\r\nstill in the following (fourth) chapter of the Ninth [Sidenote:\r\n_Composition._] Book, which, together with the surveys of literature in\r\nthe Tenth and Twelfth, is _the_ “place” of Quintilian for our subject.\r\nFor it deals directly with Composition, in the higher sense of attention\r\nto style, and before very long we see that what is immediately uppermost\r\nin Quintilian’s mind at the moment is the order of the words, and the\r\nconsequent rhythmical effect. He spends, after a fashion pardonable to\r\nthe professional declaimer and teacher of rhetoric, some time on general\r\nremarks, rebutting the silly talk, common then as now, about the\r\nsuperiority of natural to artificial eloquence, the frippery of style,\r\nand the like. And then he mounts the battle-horse of all true critics,\r\nthe argument from alteration of arrangement of words, adding, truly\r\nenough, that the more beautiful the sentence which is thus distorted,\r\nthe worse will the distortion seem. He turns to an interesting and quite\r\nrelevant historical digression on the lateness of deliberate style, and\r\non its differences, narrowing these for the present to two, “loose” and\r\n“firm,” by which it would appear that he does not mean the usual\r\ncontrast of “loose” and “periodic,” but merely that between irregular\r\nconversational style and set speech. Then, noting the technical\r\ndivisions of phrases, clauses, and sentences, he considers the order of\r\nwords, and (being a Latin) of course urges the conclusion of the\r\nsentence with a verb, where possible, and perstringes certain sentences\r\nof Mæcenas, a notedly “precious” writer, in which we can only dimly\r\nperceive the offence.\r\n\r\nRemarks on emphasis, hiatus, cacophonous conjunction of consonants,\r\njingle, plethora of monosyllables, and the like, [Sidenote: _Prose\r\nrhythm._] follow, and then the great and difficult subject of rhythm is\r\ntackled directly. Distinguishing it from metre, correctly if not quite\r\nsufficiently, by the necessity that the latter should show a certain\r\norder, he proceeds to deal with the proper rhythm of prose in the most\r\ndifficult, but not least important, passage of his book, rightly\r\ninsisting in sum on the presence of _numbers_, which are not to be\r\nmonotonous. Some of his minor directions are, indeed, dark to us,\r\nespecially his objection, not merely in prose, but even in verse, to\r\npolysyllables at the end. And though we are in full light again when he\r\ndenounces complete verses in prose (the chief formal fault of Mr\r\nRuskin), he, here also, goes too far for us. The most delicate English\r\near would not object to the equivalent of Sallust’s “Falso queritur de\r\nnatura sua,”[404] to the commencement of a hexameter in the\r\n_Timæus_,[405] or to the muffled Galliambic of Thucydides.[406]\r\n\r\nFootnote 404:\r\n\r\n  Said to be an iambic decasyllable—hobbling enough!\r\n\r\nFootnote 405:\r\n\r\n  Εἷς δύο τρεῖσ· ὁ δὲ δὴ τέταρτος ἡμῶν ὧ φίλε. The first words to δὴ\r\n  make the beginning of a hexameter or a penthemimer elegiac, the whole,\r\n  omitting Εἷς, a very “lolloping” iambic trimeter, while ὁ to ἡμῶν is\r\n  an Anacreontic. Plato would certainly have retorted that where so many\r\n  metres are possible no one can arise distinctly, and therefore\r\n  disagreeably, to the ear.\r\n\r\nFootnote 406:\r\n\r\n  ὑπὲρ ἥμισυ Κᾶρες ἐφάνησαν. Spalding, I think, detected Galliambic\r\n  cadence here, regarding the first foot as an anapæst and the rest as\r\n  two third pæons. You may also begin with a third pæon (ὑπὲρ ἥμι), as\r\n  do many of the lines of the _Atys_ itself. Therefore I call it\r\n  “muffled,” and have dwelt on the pæon, though the Galliambic is more\r\n  commonly thought of as Ionic _a minore_. Professor Hardie, however,\r\n  suggests to me that Quintilian was actually thinking of the Sotadean\r\n  metre of which he himself, lower in the chapter, quotes an example\r\n  beginning rather like this.\r\n\r\nBut this in the last case is, perhaps, due to the fact that the pæon is\r\nhardly an English poetic foot at all, and in the first to the fact that\r\nwe have nothing corresponding to the strangely broken rhythm of the\r\nLatin comic senarius and tetrameter. It is, however, in dealing with the\r\nfeet of prose that Quintilian, like Aristotle, gets most out of our\r\ndepth, and for the same reason, that we really do not know enough—if we\r\nknow anything—about the pronunciation, or intonation, of Greek and\r\nLatin. Yet the general drift, if here and there we do not quite “feel\r\nour feet,” is unmistakable and unmistakably correct, and the whole is an\r\nexcellent sample of a kind of criticism most necessary, much neglected\r\nin modern times till very recently, and entirely independent of any mere\r\nrhetorical technicality. And it is followed—at section 116 onward—by\r\nsome general remarks of capital importance, laying down among other\r\nthings that the chief touchstone of composition is the ear, and\r\nadmitting that in many cases, both of selection of single words and\r\n_ordonnance_ of phrases, it is impossible to render an exact reason why\r\none thing is right and another wrong. It is so: and there’s an end on’t!\r\nIn the peroration of the Book, first the orator receives some special,\r\nand then (at 138 onward) the author, in verse as well as in prose, some\r\ngeneral, cautions and admonitions as to musical effect.\r\n\r\nBut all this, good as it is, could be easily spared, if the choice lay\r\nbetween it and the Tenth book. For here, and here only, do [Sidenote:\r\n_Book X.: Survey of Classical Literature._] we get, from an eminent\r\ncritic of the first rank, a critical survey of the joint literatures of\r\nGreece and Rome, during the main classical course of both. Interesting\r\nas this would be from any one of tolerable ability, seeing that it is\r\nprecisely what we lack—doubly interesting as it is from a man of\r\nQuintilian’s learning, long practice in teaching, and interest in the\r\nsubject—it becomes trebly so from certain characteristics of his which\r\nhave been more than once glanced at, and which make him an almost\r\nperfect, certainly a typical, exponent in rational form of what may be\r\nregarded as the standard orthodoxy—the _textus receptus_ of the critical\r\ncreed—of the ancients. Aristotle came too early to give this opinion\r\nwith full knowledge, and would, perhaps, always have been disinclined to\r\ngive it in the same way. Longinus, we feel, is an exception of genius.\r\nBut what Quintilian says the enormous majority of cultivated Greeks and\r\nRomans (allowing in the former case for particularist and parochial\r\ncontempt of the latter) are likely to have thought. He prefaces the\r\nsurvey by an interesting, and perhaps not really equivocal, explanation\r\nof the reasons for its insertion. I say “perhaps not really equivocal,”\r\nbecause Quintilian, a very genuine person, would not have hesitated to\r\ngive it the form of an apology if he had meant it apologetically. The\r\norator on his probation must, he says, study and imitate for himself all\r\nthe best authors, not merely the orators themselves, but, as no less an\r\nauthority than Theophrastus recommended, poets, and historians, and\r\nphilosophers. But this must be done with care and judgment; for the\r\nmethods of history are not the same as those of oratory, and it is no\r\nuse addressing one kind of juryman with the pregnant terseness of\r\nSallust, or another kind with the _lactea ubertas_ of Livy, while the\r\nphilosophers require the same caution, put in a different way. And some\r\nremarks of his on at least the more celebrated authors will be expected\r\nby his friends—to which friends we owe more thanks than is always the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nHe “begins with Zeus,” that is to say, Homer, and delivers a very neat\r\nset criticism on him from that oratorical point of view which was so\r\ncommon in regard to both Homer and Virgil.\r\n\r\n“For he, as,” in his own words, \"the violence of rivers and the courses\r\nof the springs take their beginning from the ocean, [Sidenote: _Greek:\r\nHomer and other Epic poets._] has given an example and a starting-point\r\nto all parts of eloquence. Him none has excelled, for great things in\r\nsublimity as for small ones in propriety of speech. At once abundant and\r\ncompressed, agreeable and serious, wonderful now in volume, now in\r\nterseness, is he; and not only in poetical, but also in oratorical,\r\nvirtue most eminent. For, not to say anything of his panegyrics, his\r\nhortatives, his consolations, do not the Ninth Book, with the embassy\r\nsent to Achilles, and the quarrel between the generals in the First, and\r\nthe sentences expressed in the Second, set forth every device of\r\nadvocacy and debate?\" &c., &c.\r\n\r\nOthers he treats more briefly. Hesiod is in the middle style only, but\r\neasy and sententious in that. Antimachus[407] (one of our losses) is\r\nsecond to Homer, has force, energy, originality, but is deficient in\r\nattractiveness and in _ordonnance_. Panyasis (another) excels Hesiod in\r\nsubject and Antimachus in treatment. Apollonius has an evenly sustained\r\nmediocrity. Aratus is “equal to the work to which he thought himself\r\nequal”—an ingeniously double-edged compliment. Theocritus (one must\r\nquote the whole of this, and waive the discussion of it) “is admirable\r\nin his peculiar style, but his rustic and pastoral muse shrinks not only\r\nfrom appearing in the forum, but even from approaching the city.” And\r\nthen Pisander, Nicander, Euphorion, Tyrtæus, Callimachus, Philetas are\r\nslid over rapidly, while, though Aristarchus had sanctioned three\r\n_iambographi_, Simonides and Hipponax are passed in silence, Archilochus\r\nonly receiving very high praise for vigour and all similar qualities.\r\n\r\nFootnote 407:\r\n\r\n  _V. supra_, pp. 20, 85. Perhaps no single “windfall of the Muses”\r\n  would be so great a gain to literary criticism, in respect of Greek,\r\n  as the recovery of a substantial portion of Antimachus.\r\n\r\nSo, too, of the nine canonical lyrists, Bacchylides, Ibycus, Anacreon,\r\nAlcman, and even Sappho, are overlooked. Pindar [Sidenote: _The\r\nLyrists._] has a brilliant testimonial, to which, however, the authority\r\nof Horace seems to be thought necessary as an indorsement. Stesichorus\r\nis “equal to a great subject, strong, dignified, but exuberant.” Alcæus\r\nis magnificent, but descends to sportive and amorous subjects (_ecce\r\nidola scholæ!_); and Simonides, though of no very lofty genius, is\r\ncorrect and pleasing.\r\n\r\nThe Old Comedy, with the usual three selected, but not characterised\r\nseparately, is better adapted for the orator’s use [Sidenote: _Drama._]\r\nthan anything save Homer: it is the cream of Attic; it is graceful,\r\nelegant (and one may wonder for a moment, but it is a useful warning as\r\nto the connotation of the word), “sublime.” The judgment of the three\r\ntragedians is scarcely worthy of Quintilian. He speaks of Æschylus very\r\nmuch as a Frenchman, not in the times of utter ignorance, used to speak\r\nof Shakespeare. He is half silent, half enigmatic, on Sophocles; but he\r\ngives Euripides obviously heartfelt praise, and thinks him the most\r\nserviceable study of all for the orator. To which observations\r\nAristophanes would pretty certainly have retorted (clothing the retort\r\nin language perhaps sadly lacking in decorum) that it was not very\r\nwonderful that the sophist should be useful to the rhetorician.\r\n\r\nVery high, too, is the praise of Menander. Indeed, as we have seen\r\nbefore, Menander held a much higher position with the ancients than, if\r\nwe had more than fragments of him, he would, from those fragments, be\r\nlikely to hold with the moderns. He is praised (almost in the very\r\nwords) for his “criticism of life,”[408] and a tradition is mentioned\r\nthat he was an orator as well as a poet. But whether this be the case or\r\nnot, passages in his plays are cited as possessing all the charms of\r\neloquence, and he is especially extolled for that presentation of\r\ncharacter—_ethopœia_—which the ancients exacted from the orator even\r\nmore than from the poet. Philemon is the other late comic mentioned, and\r\nthough the taste of the age that preferred him is denounced as bad, he\r\nis admitted as a fair second.\r\n\r\nFootnote 408:\r\n\r\n  _Ita omnem vitæ imaginem expressit._\r\n\r\nHerodotus and Thucydides are of course put in front of the historians,\r\nand are contrasted fairly, though not with a great [Sidenote: _The\r\nHistorians._] deal of penetration. Theopompus, Philistus, Ephorus,\r\nClitarchus, and Timagenes are slightly mentioned: but Xenophon, somewhat\r\nto our surprise, is put off to the philosophers. Yet this is of itself a\r\nuseful _datum_ for our inquiry, when we think how low _we_ should put\r\nXenophon’s contributions to philosophy (as distinguished of course from\r\nphilosophical biography), how much higher even the rather dry annals of\r\nthe _Hellenics_, how much higher still the agreeable miscellanies, and\r\nthe pleasant didactic romance of the _Cyropædia_, and how far highest of\r\nall, the _Anabasis_, with its vivid realisation of action and scenery,\r\nand the narrative power which gives a romantic interest to the rather\r\nundeserved escape of a gang of mercenary filibusters.\r\n\r\nConscious, probably, that the comparison of them must be hackneyed,\r\nQuintilian does not dwell long on the Greek orators, [Sidenote: _The\r\norators and philosophers._] even on that half of The Ten which he\r\nselects, and of the later speakers mentions only Demetrius Phalereus. He\r\nis much more enthusiastic about the philosophers, discerning\r\n“agreeableness” of style[409] in Aristotle, a judgment in which few of\r\nus who have groaned over the not indeed obscure, but hard and juiceless,\r\nlanguage of the _Ethics_ and the _Organon_, will quite acquiesce, while\r\nwe might think it rather kind even for that which clothes the more\r\npopular matter of the _Politics_, _Poetics_, and _Rhetoric_. But it\r\nwould not be easy better to recognise the mastery of Plato, “whether in\r\nacumen of argument, or in a certain divine and Homeric faculty of\r\nstyle.” He rises far above mere prose, and seems instinct, not with\r\nhuman reason, but with a sort of Delphic inspiration. Xenophon at last\r\nreceives due meed for his “unaffected delightfulness beyond the reach of\r\naffectation,” and the “persuasive goddess that sits on his lips.”[410]\r\nPerhaps Theophrastus may be a “little overparted” with “divine\r\nbrilliance,”[411] though of course the epithet is a mere translation of\r\nthe name Aristotle gave him.\r\n\r\nFootnote 409:\r\n\r\n  _Eloquendi suavitas._ Cicero is equally complimentary, however, in\r\n  speaking of his _flumen aureum_: and the charitable have thought that\r\n  these qualities were discoverable in the lost _Dialogues_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 410:\r\n\r\n  Eupolis on Pericles.\r\n\r\nFootnote 411:\r\n\r\n  _Nitor divinus._\r\n\r\nWhen the critic approaches his own countrymen his words have, perhaps,\r\nan even greater interest. He begins of course [Sidenote:\r\n_Latin—Virgil._] with Virgil, and, as in duty bound, ranks him next to\r\nHomer, and nearer Homer than any one is near himself. Yet a suspicion\r\ncrosses one’s mind whether Quintilian was exactly enthusiastic about the\r\nelegant Mantuan, for he talks about his being “obliged to take more\r\ncare,”[412] about his losing in the higher qualities, but finding\r\ncompensations, &c.\r\n\r\nFootnote 412:\r\n\r\n  _Ei fuit magis laborandum._\r\n\r\nSo far so good. But what shall we say of this: “All others must follow\r\nafar off. For Macer and Lucretius are indeed to [Sidenote: _Other epic\r\nand didactic poets._] be read, but not for supplying phrase—that is to\r\nsay, the body of style. Each is elegant in his own subject, but the one\r\nis tame and the other difficult.” Now, as to Macer we know little or\r\nnothing; he seems to have been a sort of Roman Armstrong or Darwin, who\r\nwrote about herbs, drugs, &c.[413] But Lucretius—a greater master of\r\nphrase than Landor himself, nay, a greater, perhaps, than Milton—\"not\r\ngood for supplying\" it, and merely “difficult”? One wants, again, some\r\nAristophanic interjection. Varro is damned with faint praise as not\r\nindeed despicable (_non spernendus quidem_), but _parum locuples_.\r\nEnnius is spoken of as some of our own critics used to speak of\r\nChaucer—as a gigantic and aged oak, venerable but not beautiful. Ovid is\r\n“wanton,” and too fond of his own conceits. Valerius Flaccus is a great\r\nloss. Others—Severus, Bassus, Rabirius, Pedo[414]—names to us mostly,\r\nthough we have fragments of at least three, are dismissed, the two first\r\nwith high praise, the two last with the scarcely enthusiastic remark\r\nthat the orator may read them, if _he has time_. Lucan is ardent, eager,\r\nand of noble sententiousness, but rather an orator than a poet. Domitian\r\nwould have been the greatest of poets, _if_ the gods had pleased. But,\r\nunluckily, they did not please!\r\n\r\nFootnote 413:\r\n\r\n  His fragments in Baehrens’s _Poetæ Minores_, vol. vi. pp. 344, 345,\r\n  run to seventeen, none exceeding two lines, and only two so long. The\r\n  most complete is this—\r\n\r\n             “Cygnus in auspiciis semper lætissimus ales:\r\n             Hunc optant nautæ, quia se non mergit in undis.”\r\n\r\n  This is certainly not much better than _humilis_, “tame” in phrase.\r\n\r\nFootnote 414:\r\n\r\n  Of Cornelius Severus, a friend of Ovid, who wrote on the Sicilian war,\r\n  and of whom Quintilian thinks that, had he lived, he might have been\r\n  second to Virgil, we have some dozen odd lines, and a more solid\r\n  fragment of twenty-five, enshrining that plagiarism from Sextilius Ena\r\n  which has been noticed above (p. 235). It has some merit. For Saleius\r\n  Bassus see above (p. 281). The five scraps which we possess of\r\n  Rabirius warrant no judgment. But Seneca the Rhetorician in a context\r\n  noticed above (p. 234), has preserved a block of twenty-three lines of\r\n  Albinovanus Pedo on the voyage of Germanicus, which have a certain\r\n  declamatory vigour. See Baehrens, vi. 351-356. (Some elegies have also\r\n  been attributed to Pedo.)\r\n\r\nIn elegy Tibullus is Quintilian’s choice, but he admits that others\r\nprefer Propertius. Ovid is more luxuriant than either; [Sidenote:\r\n_Elegiac and miscellaneous._] Gallus harsher. Horace receives praise\r\nthrice over as terse, pure and just in satire, bitter in iambics\r\n(lampoons), and almost the only Roman deserving to be read[415] in\r\nlyric—where he sometimes soars. He is full of pleasant grace, and is\r\nagreeably audacious. After this, or rather before it, it is not\r\nsurprising that Catullus is only mentioned for “bitter” iambics. As\r\nolder satirists (“Satire is _ours_!” says Quintilian with a pleasant\r\npatriotic exaltation), Lucilius and Varro have praise.\r\n\r\nThe remarks on Tragedy we are unfortunately unable to check; but it is\r\ninteresting that Quintilian apparently thought [Sidenote: _Drama._]\r\nLatin better off here than in Comedy, which we certainly should not have\r\nexpected. He quotes the traditional praise of the language of Plautus\r\nwithout expressing any opinion on it, but in a fashion pretty clearly\r\nintimating that he was unable to agree.[416] “The ancients extol\r\nCæcilius,”—another phrase which can only be pointed in one way; and\r\nTerence, though extremely elegant in his kind, scarcely attains to a\r\nfaint image of Greek. It seems, however, as if he would have thought\r\nbetter of Afranius had it not been for that foulness of subject which,\r\nfrom the frequency of mention of it in connection with the author, seems\r\nto have turned the by no means squeamish stomach even of less moral\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\nFootnote 415:\r\n\r\n  _At Lyricorum idem Horatius fere solus legi dignus._\r\n\r\nFootnote 416:\r\n\r\n  _In comœdia maxime claudicamus: licet Varro, Musas (Ælii Stilonis\r\n  sententia), Plautino dicat sermone locuturas fuisse, si Latine loqui\r\n  vellent._\r\n\r\nHe is much more patriotic in regard to History—in fact, his patriotism\r\nrather outruns his discretion. One may have the [Sidenote: _History._]\r\nhighest admiration of Sallust’s masterly sweep (“immortal velocity”\r\nQuintilian himself calls it), of his pregnant thought and vivid\r\nrepresentation, yet hesitate to match the two miniatures or Kit-cats of\r\nthe _Jugurtha_ and the _Catiline_ against the mighty grasp and volume,\r\nalike in whole and in detail, of the _Peloponnesian War_. It must,\r\nhowever, be remembered that Sallust wrote a larger _History_ in four\r\nbooks, which is lost except in fragments. Livy with Herodotus, though\r\nQuintilian thinks the latter ought not to feel indignant at the match,\r\nis only not so _impar congressus_, because there is here no unequality\r\nin scale and range. But, once more, the expression of opinion is a\r\nvaluable one, and we must come back to it. Of Servilius Nonianus and\r\nAufidius Bassus we know nothing; but the section ends with a high and\r\nmost interesting panegyric on a certain unnamed living historian, whom\r\nwe must all hope, though some would identify him with Pliny, to be\r\nTacitus. If _he_ had been equalled with even the greatest of the Greeks,\r\nThucydides might have made room for him with hardly condescending\r\ngood-humour.\r\n\r\nHaving thus put himself in the mood of “our country right or wrong” by\r\nthis time, Quintilian is emboldened to match [Sidenote:\r\n_Oratory—Cicero._] Cicero against any Greek orator, though he proceeds\r\nto explain that this is not meant to depress Demosthenes. Thus minded,\r\nhe certainly does not go to work “with a dead hand,” as the French say,\r\nand endows his favourite not merely with the energy of Demosthenes, but\r\nwith the flow of Plato and the sweetness of Isocrates. (One may invoke\r\nthe aid of Echo—courteous nymph—and assent at least to Isocrates.) And\r\nthen he passes to other Latin orators, praising Pollio for pains, and\r\nMessala for an aristocratic elegance. Cæsar (it is noticeable that he\r\nsays nothing of the _Commentaries_) has qualities in his speeches which\r\nmight have made him a rival to Cicero, especially the elegance of his\r\ndiction. Cælius for wit; Calvus for severe correctness; others for other\r\nthings, receive homage.\r\n\r\nIn Latin philosophy he again, with some rashness, advances Cicero as a\r\nrival to Plato, and ends with a curious and interesting [Sidenote:\r\n_Philosophy—Cicero and Seneca._] passage on Seneca, whom he had been\r\nsupposed to condemn and even hate, whose vitiated taste he still\r\nreprehends, but to whose real merits he now makes handsome concessions.\r\nThis is quite one of Quintilian’s best “diploma-pieces” as a literary\r\ncritic, in the division of decided but not illiberal censure, qualified\r\nby just and not grudging allowance for merits. It is a pity that it is\r\ntoo long to quote.\r\n\r\nWith the rest of the book, interesting as it is and germane to our\r\nsubject, we must deal more succinctly. It first handles [Sidenote:\r\n_Minor counsel of the Tenth Book._] Imitation of the styles just run\r\nthrough, and contains some of the best advice available anywhere on that\r\nhead. The danger of imitating one style is especially dwelt upon, and\r\nQuintilian draws nearer to Greece or England than to Rome, in the simple\r\nobservation that he has known Ciceronians think themselves quite\r\naccomplished when they ended a sentence with _esse videatur_. _Habemus\r\ncriticum!_ Another most excellent chapter is devoted to Writing—that is\r\nto say, to “exercises in composition,” which, under the dispensation of\r\nRhetoric, were much in use. We know that Cicero wrote theses at the\r\nmoment, and on the subject, of his sorest trouble. Quintilian’s advice\r\nhere again is excellent; and if it were worse, it would be saved by the\r\ndelightful story he tells of Julius Florus, a Gaulish provincial (for\r\nliterary talent was beginning to be centrifugal), who, to his nephew and\r\nQuintilian’s friend Julius Secundus, when he was troubled about his\r\nstyle, observed, “Do you want to write better than you can?” Nor should\r\nthe subsequent observations on rough copies be passed over. The rough\r\ncopy is the superstition of those who wish to write better than they\r\ncan. In some respects, and especially for the urbane, intimate,\r\nun-Philistine common-sense of it, this is one of Quintilian’s best\r\nchapters. He follows it up by a short one on Correction, wisely\r\nobserving that we may indulge in that too much; by another on\r\nTranslation, dedication-writing, and so forth; by yet another on\r\npremeditation, and by a last on speaking extempore, which he says\r\n(irrefutably from his oratorical point of view, and perhaps not much\r\nless so from the point of general literature) is all but a _sine qua\r\nnon_. In these later chapters he is, as we may say, pursuing the art of\r\nthe critic the reverse way—that is to say, he is counselling the author\r\nhow to anticipate the critic. But it ought to be needless to add that\r\nthey are not the less important as chapters of a manual of criticism\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe Eleventh book is wholly professional, dealing with the manner and\r\ngeneral conduct appropriate to the orator, the [Sidenote: _Books XI.,\r\nXII.: The styles of oratory._] cultivation of the memory, delivery,\r\ngesture, and so forth. It therefore yields us nothing, while the\r\nbeginning of the Twelfth, with its respectable paradox that a good\r\norator must be a good man, may not look more promising, nor the\r\nsubsequent demonstration that he ought to be acquainted with the civil\r\nlaw, and with examples and precedents, that he must have firmness and\r\npresence of mind, years of discretion, and also reasonable fees and\r\nretainers, that he must study his brief, not lay himself out too much\r\nfor mere applause, and while preparing carefully, be ready with\r\nimpromptus and extempore speech when necessary. But when we are\r\nbeginning to get a little weary of this good-man-of-the-Stoics, called\r\nto the bar, an abrupt turn to the style of oratory refreshes us. The\r\nsketch of literature in the Tenth Book had been made, it is to be\r\nremembered, from a somewhat different point of view; it had been\r\noccupied with the authors whom an orator should read, and the qualities\r\nwhich were to be discovered in them. Here the standpoint changes, and\r\nthe literary quality of what the orator himself is to produce is the\r\nquestion. After a distinctly interesting parallel from painting and\r\nsculpture, to illustrate differences of style, Quintilian takes up these\r\ndifferences, in some cases repeating the descriptions of Book X., in\r\nreference to Latin orators, and especially renewing his eulogy of Cicero\r\nas excellent in every oratorical quality. This, however, he admits, was\r\nby no means the universal opinion, either of Cicero’s contemporaries or\r\nof succeeding critics. And he hits a distinct blot in too much literary\r\ncriticism by pointing out that while these earlier critics usually\r\ncensured the great Arpinate as too flowery, too Asiatic, too fond of\r\njests, his, Quintilian’s, [Sidenote: “_Atticism._”] own contemporaries\r\nwere apt to speak of him as dry and wanting in succulence. Next he turns\r\nto the three famous divisions of oratorical style—Attic, Asiatic, and\r\nRhodian: the first chastened, energetic, correct; the second redundant\r\nand flowery; the third a mixture of the other two. And then, with his\r\nusual unpretending shrewdness, he proceeds to point out that although\r\nthere certainly _is_ an Attic style, and this style is far the best, yet\r\nthat there are many, nay, infinite varieties and subdivisions of it—that\r\nLysias is not in the least like Andocides, Isocrates different from\r\neither, Hyperides apart from all three. And so, with perfect good sense,\r\nhe objects to the limitation of the “odour of thyme,” the Attic charm,\r\nto those who “flow as a slender stream making its way through\r\npebbles”—that is to say, to those who write in a studiously correct and\r\nelegant style, with no magniloquence or turbid rush.\r\n\r\nMore interesting still, because it is the first and by far the best\r\nthing of the kind that we have, is the passage which follows on the\r\noratorical—we may excusably read the [Sidenote: _Literary quality of\r\nGreek and Latin._] “literary”—qualities of the Latin language as\r\ncompared with the Greek. There are, it is true, phonetic difficulties\r\nhere, and probably no wise man will pretend to understand Quintilian’s\r\npraise of the “sweetness” of the Greek _phi_, as compared with the harsh\r\nrepulsiveness of the Latin _f_ and _v_. No one but a student of\r\nphonetics themselves (that is to say, of a science as arbitrary as the\r\nmost technical part of the Hermogenean rhetoric) can perceive any\r\ndifference between _phi_ and _f_, or the repulsiveness of the latter and\r\nof _v_, or the extra harshness of _fr_ as in _frangit_. _Fr_, to a\r\nmodern English ear, gives a very harmonious sound indeed. He\r\nincidentally, however, as far as _v_ is concerned, gives us a “light” by\r\nsaying that the sound of the digamma was preserved in _Servus_ and\r\n_Cervus_, so that the Romans adopted the Wellerian form in these words;\r\nand has a specially interesting observation (because it applies equally\r\nto Anglo-Saxon) on the ugliness of terminations in _m_, “like the lowing\r\nof an ox,” as opposed to the clear ringing Greek _n_. The intonation of\r\nLatin he also thinks inferior to Greek, and still more the vocabulary.\r\nBut _sursum corda_! after all:—\r\n\r\n“Wherefore, if any demand from Latins the grace of Attic speech, let him\r\ngive us the same sweetness of utterance, and an equal abundance of\r\nwords. If this be denied, we must match our meaning to the words we\r\nhave, nor mix a too great subtlety of matter with words too strong, not\r\nto say too stout, for it, lest the combination lose either excellence.\r\nThe less the mere language helps us, the more we must reinforce\r\nourselves by invention of matter. Let us extract sublime and varied\r\nmeanings. Let us stir all the passions, and illuminate our addresses\r\nwith gleaming metaphor. We cannot be so graceful; let us be more\r\nvigorous. We are conquered in subtlety; let us prevail in weight. _They_\r\nare surer of propriety, let _us_ overcome by numbers. The genius of the\r\nGreeks, even in their lesser men, has its own ports; let us spread more\r\nample sail and fill it with a mightier breeze. Nor let us always seek\r\nthe deep; we must sometimes follow the windings of the shore. _They_ may\r\nslip over any shallows; let _me_ find a deeper sea in which my bark may\r\nnot sink.”\r\n\r\nA very little farther[417] and we find Wordsworth’s paradox in the\r\nPreface to the _Lyrical Ballads_—that there is no natural eloquence but\r\nin the speech of ordinary folk—anticipated, stated, and very happily and\r\nthoroughly answered, though in reference to prose, not verse; and after\r\nthis, some interesting further observations on _sententiæ_—deliberate\r\nand ostentatious sententiousnesses.\r\n\r\nFootnote 417:\r\n\r\n  XII. x. 40.\r\n\r\nLater still he returns upon himself, and adopts a fresh threefold\r\ndivision into ἰσχνὸν or plain; ἁδρὸν or grand; and ἀνθηρὸν or florid,\r\nexamples of each of which, with oratorical adaptations, he proceeds to\r\ngive, perorating on plain and florid style, in a manner not unworthy of\r\nhis precepts. He concludes with a sort of postscript on the necessity of\r\nthe orator’s withdrawing before his natural force is abated, and thus\r\nleads, by a not ungraceful parable, to his own _Finis_.\r\n\r\nIt may be hoped that the above analysis, however jejune and imperfect,\r\nof this remarkable book will at least serve as a basis for some\r\nintelligible, if brief, remarks on its position [Sidenote: _Quintilian’s\r\ncritical ethos._] and value in the history of literary criticism. Its\r\n_status_ as a document of this is, like that of all other ancient\r\ndocuments without exception (even the Περὶ Ὕψους cannot rank as\r\ncompletely exceptional), an indirect one, one of but partial relevance\r\nto the gospel of criticism. The Law of Rhetoric was but a schoolmaster,\r\nteaching, like all good schoolmasters, many things which had no absolute\r\nbearing on the future life of its pupils. And it is all the more curious\r\nthat Quintilian should nevertheless give us so much that is of direct\r\nimportance, because he is not merely a literary critic at intervals, but\r\nalmost a literary critic _malgré lui_. Except in the case of Cicero,\r\nwhere his professional feeling comes in, he displays no very great\r\nenthusiasm for literature. He is never tempted, as not merely Longinus,\r\nbut even Dionysius, is, to take a particular author, book, piece, and\r\nthoroughly analyse him and it, to grasp it, turn it lovingly inside out,\r\nhold it up to the admiration of others, deck it with the ornament, and\r\nadore it with the incense, of his own. His interest, though liberal, is\r\njust a trifle utilitarian. He holds, like Scott’s counsellor, that “a\r\nlawyer without history or literature is a mere mechanic,” and he studies\r\nboth accordingly; but his study is mainly a means to an end. He may not\r\nbe exactly insensible to the pure beauty of literature in and by itself;\r\nbut it may be suspected that, if he spoke of it freely, he would speak\r\nin much the same tone that he uses in an odd passage[418] about working\r\nin the country, where he thinks the beauty of tree and flower, the song\r\nof birds, the sound of streams, likely to distract rather than to\r\ninspire. The prose of the Roman nature, its businesslike character, its\r\nmatter-of-factness, all betray themselves a little in him.\r\n\r\nFootnote 418:\r\n\r\n  X. iii. 22-24. It is natural to compare this with the remarks of Aper\r\n  and Maternus in the _Dialogus_.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not wonderful that he embodies for us, in a vary\r\nedifying fashion, that distrust of the Romantic which appears so often,\r\nif not so constantly, in the post-Homeric classical ages, up to his own\r\ntime, though soon after it was to break down in writers like Apuleius.\r\nWe saw that if he did not absolutely dislike or despise, he ignored the\r\nromantic element in Xenophon, that the “seizing” situation of the Ten\r\nThousand, leaderless though victorious, a handful isolated in the heart\r\nof a hostile country, the moving accidents of their journey across the\r\nmountain walls and through the warlike clans of Kurdistan, and all the\r\nrest, till the sight of the sea, and the rush to the hill-brow to behold\r\nit, and the shout of welcome—even though the incident be as rhetorical a\r\nthing as history and literature contain—pass entirely unnoticed by him.\r\nHis astonishing dismissals of Lucretius (though he may have been\r\nprejudiced by Cicero[419] there) as merely “difficult,” of Catullus as\r\nmerely “bitter,” group themselves with this very well. The grim force of\r\nthe Lucretian despair, which would so fain persuade itself to be\r\nscientific acquiescence in contemplation from the temples of the wise,\r\nthe throb of the Catullian passion, are not his business. Indeed, what\r\n_contio_, what _judices_, would pay any attention to the drift of the\r\natoms in the void? what respectable paterfamilias but must highly\r\ndeprecate verses, not merely immoral but extravagant, to Ipsithilla and\r\nLesbia, attempts to reproduce, in sober Latin, the Greek ravings of a\r\nSappho or about an Attis? Apollonius Rhodius, too, who to us seems a\r\nRomantic before Romanticism, touches no chord in Quintilian’s breast.\r\nAnd we may be tolerably certain that the chords which were not\r\nresponsive in the breast of Quintilian were at least equally mute in\r\nother breasts of his time.\r\n\r\nFootnote 419:\r\n\r\n  This remark is, of course, made subject to the uncertainties referred\r\n  to above (p. 214 _sq._).\r\n\r\nBut these shortcomings are not only inevitable, they are, for the\r\npurpose of the historian, almost welcome. We may protest as lovers, but\r\nwe register and interpret as students. Moreover, Quintilian, like all\r\nthe greater men in all periods, and some even of the smaller in some,\r\nsupplies us with a great deal of matter for registration and\r\ninterpretation, without any protest at all. In the first place, we see\r\nin him the gradual deflection or development (whichever word may be\r\npreferred) of Rhetoric into pure Literary Criticism, assisted by the\r\npractical disappearance of symbouleutic oratory, by the degradation of\r\nepideictic, and by the practical Roman contempt for mere technicalities,\r\nunless, as in the case of law, they are intimately and almost\r\ninextricably connected with some practical end. It would be possible, as\r\nwe have seen, by a process of mere “lifting out,” with hardly any\r\nimportant garbling of phrase, to extract from the _Institutions_ a\r\n“Treatise on Composition and Critical Reading” which would be of no mean\r\nbulk, of no narrow range, and would contain a very large proportion of\r\nstrictly relevant and valuable detail. And this treatise would be\r\nilluminated—for practically the only time, in the range of ancient\r\nliterature on the subject, to any considerable extent—by that\r\nsearchlight of criticism, the comparative method; while it would also\r\ndisplay, throughout, the other illuminative powers of wide reading,\r\nsound judgment, and an excellent and by no means merely pedestrian\r\ncommon-sense.\r\n\r\nWe may regret, indeed, as we have regretted already, that these good\r\ngifts were not turned to the business of direct literary examination of\r\nparticular books and authors, after the fashion of Dionysius; but it is\r\nquite evident why they were not. And their actual use has resulted in\r\npassage on passage, in chapter on chapter, of the most precious\r\nmaterial. Quintilian can only be despised by those who consider\r\nthemselves defrauded if critics do not attempt the _meteorosophia_ of\r\nthe highest æsthetic generalisations. It is, on the other hand, certain\r\nthat these airy flights, in this particular matter, have too often had\r\nthe ultimate Icarian fate, and have not often met even with the\r\ntemporary Icarian success. The “high priori way” has never led to any\r\npermanent conquest in literary criticism; and it is never likely to do\r\nso, because of the blessed infinity and incalculableness of human\r\ngenius. It has constantly led that genius into deserts and _impasses_.\r\nEven things that look like generalisations firmly based on actual\r\nexperience have to be cautiously guarded, and put forth merely as\r\nworking hypotheses. You make, with the almost superhuman compound of\r\nlearning and reason belonging to an Aristotle, a general theory of\r\nPoetry, and a special one of Tragedy, which require, and command, almost\r\nuniversal agreement. In a few hundred years there drops in a graceless\r\nsort of prose tale-tellers, who by establishing, slowly and uncertainly\r\nat first, but after a couple of thousand years unmistakably, the kind of\r\nprose fiction, sap the very foundations of your theory of poetry. Later\r\nstill arises a more graceless sort of strolling actors, ne’er-do-weel\r\nuniversity men in England, cavaliers or shavelings in Spain, who in the\r\nsame way bring it about that your theory of tragedy has to acknowledge\r\nitself to be only a theory of one kind of tragedy.\r\n\r\nThe other way is the way of safety; and if it be objected that it is the\r\nway of plodders only, one could undertake to make a very striking\r\ncompany of plodders from Longinus to Mr Arnold, who, sometimes not quite\r\nwittingly or willingly, have done all their best work in it. It would be\r\nbut re-summarising our summary to point out once more, in any fulness,\r\nwhat work Quintilian has done. He has given us a history in little of\r\nthe choicest Greek and Latin literature; he has drawn and placed for us\r\nthe contrasted styles, not merely of oratorical, but of all prose\r\ncomposition; he has handled the literary side of grammar with singular\r\nfairness and sense; and has dealt more satisfactorily—to us at\r\nleast—than any other ancient writer with the all-important and most\r\ndifficult question of euphony in written speech. No one among ancient\r\nwriters has treated the important but delusive subject of the Figures\r\nwith more sense and skill; no one has contrived to get, out of some of\r\nthe merest technicalities of the Rhetoric of the Schools, such a solid\r\nextract of critical power. The technical observations in Book X., which\r\nfor want of space we passed over rapidly, form the most invaluable\r\n_Introduction to Composition_ to be found in any language; they put our\r\nmodern books of the kind to shame, at once by the practical character of\r\ntheir suggestions, and by their freedom from mere mechanical\r\narbitrariness of prescription on points where idiom, good usage, and\r\nindividual ability are really the only arbiters. And lastly, on the\r\nall-important and ever-recurring battle of the styles, Plain and Ornate,\r\nAttic and Asiatic, or whatever antithesis be preferred, it would be\r\nalmost impossible to find a more intelligent pronouncement than\r\nQuintilian’s.\r\n\r\nHe can therefore afford to smile at those who say that he _chancelle sur\r\nle terrain des principes_,[420] and to reply that _terrain_ is exactly\r\nthe word which does not apply to the principles with which he is\r\nreproached for not dealing. The only reproach to which he _is_ perhaps\r\nopen is one which all antiquity, from Aristotle to Longinus, and\r\nincluding both these great men, shares with him. This is the reproach of\r\nnever completely clearing up the mind about Rhetoric, and of perpetually\r\nconfusing it with the Art of Prose Literature, or else leaving prose\r\nliterature without any “art” at all. We have seen, long ago, how this\r\nconfusion arose, and how it was maintained by conditions which, though\r\nworking more feebly in Quintilian’s days, were still working. The matter\r\ncame to a head (though, oddly enough, the person chiefly concerned seems\r\nnot quite to have understood it) when Lucian formally renounced Rhetoric\r\nand took to essay-writing in dialogue, when Apuleius in the _Golden Ass_\r\nmingled declamation, dialogue, philosophy, and romance in one _olla\r\npodrida_, with a daring sauce of new prose style to make it go down. But\r\nthe barbarians were then at the gates; and the real recognition and\r\nreconstruction was not to take place for ages later, if it has\r\ncompletely taken place even yet.\r\n\r\nFootnote 420:\r\n\r\n  Théry, _op. cit._, i. 207.

We must, however, complete our view of\r\nthat subject, before summing up its general characteristics, with\r\nanother chapter surveying the yield of the second, third, and\r\nfourth—perhaps, in view of the uncertainty of date of Martianus, we\r\nshould add the fifth—centuries. The crop, if not very abundant, or of\r\nthe very greatest value, is neither very scanty nor very uninteresting.\r\nIt shall consist, in the specimens of it which we can afford to examine,\r\nfirst of the two famous and by no means unamusing miscellanists, the\r\nauthors of the _Noctes Atticæ_ and the _Saturnalia_; then, by an easy\r\ntransition, of the commentators and scholiasts represented by their\r\nprior Servius, himself an interlocutor in the Macrobian symposium; in\r\nthe third place, of a poetical contingent, much less important indeed\r\nthan that furnished by the satirists from Horace to Martial, but not\r\nquite insignificant; and lastly, of the technical rhetoricians, ending\r\nwith one of their latest representatives, but perhaps the most\r\ninteresting of all, Martianus Capella. The chapter will thus, at least,\r\nnot lack variety.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to have a better example of the indisposition of\r\nthe Latin mind towards literary criticism proper, [Sidenote: _Aulus\r\nGellius: the_ Noctes Atticæ.] than that which is afforded by the famous\r\n_Noctes Atticæ_ of Aulus Gellius.[421] We know nothing of this good\r\nperson except that he was probably of more or less pure Roman descent,\r\nthat he probably lived for the most part of his life at Rome and at\r\nAthens in the early second century, that he was a friend of Herodes\r\nAtticus, probably knew Plutarch, and was extremely intimate with, and a\r\ngreat admirer of, the rhetorician Favorinus. The well-known miscellany\r\nwhich he has left us, and which, in purporting to give the results of\r\nstudy or conversation in an Attic country-house, has been for seventeen\r\nhundred years so fruitful in imitations—mother, indeed, of a family\r\nsometimes a great deal fairer than herself—is an amusing book and a\r\nvaluable, because it preserves for us a great number of quotations from\r\nlost authors or books, because its farrago of matter is good pastime,\r\nand not least because of a certain Pepysian or Boswellian quality in its\r\nauthor. But though, amid its jumble of things ethical, physical,\r\nlogical, legal, and, above all, philological, perhaps the larger part is\r\noccupied with literature or at least with books, it is quite astonishing\r\nhow small is the proportion that can be called literary criticism, and\r\nhow rudimentary and infantine even that small proportion is. Gellius had\r\nnearly all the qualities and acquirements of the dictionary-maker; he\r\nwas interested in etymology, was a most exact and careful purist in the\r\ndefinition and usage of words, and evidently prided himself on his\r\ncollections of illustrative phrases and passages.[422] But almost\r\ninvariably it must be said of him that _hæret in litera_, or, if he\r\nescapes that adhesion, that he gives himself over to the substance and\r\nmeaning, not to the literary form and art, of what he quotes and\r\nstudies. In all the nineteen or twenty books of his work there are\r\nprobably not nineteen or twenty pages of real literary criticism; and\r\nwhere he does give us any it is of the “strawiest” character. Take, for\r\ninstance, his comparison (ii. 23) of the Greek and Latin comic writers,\r\nand especially of some passages of Cæcilius with their originals in\r\nMenander. In preferring the Greek he is, of course, quite right; but it\r\nis noteworthy that he can hardly render any specific reason for his\r\npreference. He says, vaguely if truly, that the Latins seem low and\r\nsordid beside the wit and brilliancy of the Greeks, that Cæcilius\r\nappears stupid and frigid by Menander. But as to detail he prudently\r\nadds, _nihil dicam ego quantum differat_; and, less prudently\r\ntransgressing this rule later, confines himself wholly to the matter,\r\naccusing the Roman of leaving out a _simplex et verum et delectabile_\r\nremark of the Greek. And if he comes a little nearer in praising (or\r\nmaking his favourite Favorinus praise) the _flavum marmor_ of Ennius, it\r\nis still pretty clear that he does this merely or mainly from the side\r\nof the dictionary-maker, pleased at getting a light on the exact meaning\r\nof _flavus_. Although to our ears his preference (vi. 20) of “Ora” to\r\n“Nola” (in the passage which Virgil is said to have altered from a\r\nrather petty spite to the Nolans), “because it makes a sweet hiatus”\r\nwith _Vesevo_ at the end of the preceding line, may seem all wrong, the\r\nprinciple is æsthetic if the application is not. But, as a rule, we\r\nshall find that his critical opinions, where they are not concerned with\r\npurely verbal matters, are always decided by moral, philosophical, or in\r\nsome other way extra-literary considerations. Even in an extremely\r\ninteresting passage towards the end (xix. 9) where he makes _Græci\r\nplusculi_ attack the Spanish-Latin rhetor Antonius Julianus[423] on the\r\nscore of the inferiority of Roman to Greek erotic poets, and gives the\r\npassages with which Julianus retorted, the chief interest for us is that\r\neven the Greeks except Catullus to some extent, and Calvus, from their\r\ncensure. For there is little or nothing but logomachy to be got out of\r\nthe condemnation of Hortensius as _invenustus_ and Cinna as _illepidus_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 421:\r\n\r\n  Ed. Hertz, 2 vols., Leipsic, 1886.\r\n\r\nFootnote 422:\r\n\r\n  Cf. the amusing chapter (vi. 17) in which he tells with innocent pride\r\n  how he overwhelmed _quempiam græculum_ with apt citations on the word\r\n  _obnoxius_. Gellius is not the only critic who has allowed parallel\r\n  passages to choke his critical faculties, or has endeavoured to make\r\n  up by the former for the absence of the latter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 423:\r\n\r\n  This Antonius Julianus, from another notice (xx. 9), seems to have\r\n  been a person of slightly florid but by no means bad taste. For\r\n  Gellius tells us that he used to say his ears were delighted and\r\n  caressed by the coined words in the first mimiambic of C. Matius,[a]\r\n  such as _Columbulatim_, which is certainly not a little charming and\r\n  very Caroline. After all, the famous advice to regard and avoid an\r\n  unusual word, _tanquam scopulum_ (which, by the way, Gellius gives\r\n  us), is fatal to poetry.\r\n\r\nFootnote a:\r\n\r\n  The fragments of this author may be found either in the sixth volume\r\n  of Baehrens’s _Poetæ Latini Minores_, or in the appendix to Otto\r\n  Crusius’s edition of Herondas (Leipsic, 1898). He has another word\r\n  which Herrick might have Englished, _albicascit_.\r\n\r\nThis same imputation of logomachy is hard to clear from the dispute in\r\nx. 3, whether, though Caius Gracchus is undoubtedly _fortis et\r\nvehemens_, it is or is not intolerable that he should be deemed\r\n_severior_, _amplior_, _acrior_, than Cicero. If Gellius had kept to the\r\nsame words, and had said _fortior_ and _vehementior_, the observation\r\njust made might seem unkind; but as it is, one seems to be dropping into\r\nthe well-known jargon of our own times, and of all times, to be hearing\r\none reviewer asserting that Johnson is “alert” and another replying that\r\nThompson is “nimble,” or opposing the “poignancy” of Smith to the\r\n“swiftness” of Brown. But the attention to words certainly comes in\r\nbetter when the critic objects to the use, in an otherwise _non sane\r\nincommode_ adapted version from Euripides by Ennius, of _ignobiles_ and\r\n_opulenti_ for ἀδοξοῦντες and δοκοῦντες. XII. 2, however, is a good\r\n_locus_ for us in more ways than one. It opens with a sketch of the\r\ndifference of opinion about Seneca in the age succeeding his own, a\r\ndifference of which Quintilian had, a little earlier, given us an\r\ninkling. “Some,” says Gellius, “think of him as of a most unprofitable\r\nwriter, one not worth reading, because they hold his style vulgar and\r\nhackneyed, his matter and opinions distinguished either by inept and\r\nempty haste (_impetu_) or by frivolous and Old-Bailey (_causidicali_)\r\nwire-drawing, his erudition vernacular and plebeian, and possessing\r\nnothing either of the dignity or the grace of the classics. Others,\r\nwhile not denying that he has little grace of phrase, maintain that his\r\nmatter lacks neither information nor teaching power, and that he has no\r\nunhappy gravity and severity in castigating vice.” He himself will give\r\nno general censure, but consider Seneca’s opinion of Cicero and Ennius\r\nand Virgil. This “consideration,” according to his wont, is rather a\r\nstring of quotations with objurgatory epithets than a regular criticism.\r\nOne may not agree with Seneca or one may (there are certainly some who\r\nwould indorse his confession and avoidance of Cicero’s faults in the\r\nwords _non ejus sed temporis vitium_). But the words which Gellius\r\nhimself uses—_insulsissime, homo nugator, inepti et insubidi[424]\r\nhominis joca_—surely require some little argument to justify them, and\r\nthis argument is what Gellius never gives. We may thank him, however,\r\nfor the criticism as well as for the anecdote preserved (xiii. 2) in the\r\nstory of the meeting of the tragic poets Pacuvius and Accius at\r\nTarentum, in the extreme old age of the former. Pacuvius had asked his\r\nyoung guest and craftsfellow to read his tragedy of _Atreus_, and, after\r\nthe reading, praised it as sonorous and grand, but perhaps a little\r\nharsh and austere. “It is so,” said the junior, “but I am not very\r\nsorry, for I hope to improve. It is the same in wits as in fruits: the\r\nhard and harsh mellow and sweeten, but those that are at first flabby,\r\nand soft, and moist, do not ripen but rot. I thought it best to have\r\nsomething in my genius for time and age to mitigate.” A sound principle,\r\nthough not quite a universal one, as one may see in studying a certain\r\nlife-work which ranges from “Claribel” to “Crossing the Bar.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 424:\r\n\r\n  A Gellian synonym or variant for _ineptus_, not found in Augustan\r\n  Latin.\r\n\r\nHe is in his more meticulous moods when (xiii. 18) he accuses Plato of\r\nmisquotation and Euripides of plagiarism; but a couple of chapters later\r\na set discourse on euphony, starting from a saying of Valerius Probus,\r\nseems to promise well. Some one had asked Probus whether it was better\r\nto use the terminations _em_ or _im_, _es_ or _is_, for the accusative,\r\nwhere both occur. _Aurem tuam interroga_, said Probus, which is no doubt\r\nthe conclusion of the whole matter. But his questioner, either foolish\r\nor dogged, asked how he was to do this, and Probus replied, “As Virgil\r\ndid when he wrote _Urbisne invisere Cæsar_ but _Urbes habitant magnas_.”\r\nNor are we sorry to hear that when the questioner still bored on, saying\r\nthat he could not understand why one should be better in one place and\r\nanother in another, Probus retorted, “_You_ need not trouble yourself;\r\nit will do _you_ no harm whatever you use.” _Prope inclementer_, says\r\nGellius (“Served him right,” most of us will say). But he goes on to\r\naccumulate some other instances of this application of the rule of\r\neuphony, and perhaps here draws as near to true criticism as he ever\r\ndoes. Nor is he wrong, though he may be fanciful, in deciding in regard\r\nto certain almost literal Virgilian imitations of Homer, that the Greek\r\nis _simplicior et sincerior_, Virgil νεωτερικώτερος _et quodam quasi\r\nferrumine immisso fucatior_.[425]\r\n\r\nHe may strain the word again too much, when he bestows a page on the\r\ndifference of _multis hominibus_ and _multis mortalibus_ (xii. 28), but\r\nhe recovers esteem when in xiv. 6 we find him rejecting, not without\r\ncontumely, contributions to his _Noctes_ on the questions “Who was the\r\nfirst grammarian?” and “Why Telemachus did not nudge his bedfellow\r\nPisistratus but kicked him?” &c., &c. _Properans reddidi_, says he, with\r\nthe shudder one can fancy, though, to tell the truth, he does himself\r\n“something grow to” this kind of disease.\r\n\r\nFootnote 425:\r\n\r\n  “Hobbledehoyish, and got up with inserted expletives.” _Ferrumen_, a\r\n  post-classical word, is almost exactly the French _cheville_.\r\n\r\nWe may close this anthology of the Gellian criticisms with some account\r\nof one of the most elaborate—a discourse of Favorinus on Pindar and\r\nVirgil.[426] After quoting the Roman poet’s traditional saying about\r\nhimself—that he brought forth his verses as a bear does her cubs,\r\nlicking them slowly and busily into shape—he points out that the facts\r\nexactly bear out the description, and that certain verses, not having\r\nundergone the process of licking, are very inferior to the others. Among\r\nthese unlicked cubs, it seems, Favorinus would place the Etna passage.\r\nEven Pindar himself, whom Virgil followed, is, the critic thinks, _ipso\r\ninsolentior tumidiorque_ in the place; but Virgil’s verse is such that\r\nFavorinus calls it “begun, not made.” And, the two passages having been\r\ncited in full, he indulges in the following drastic verbal censure: “At\r\nthe very beginning, Pindar, paying more attention to the truth, said\r\nwhat was the fact, and a matter of ocular demonstration, that Etna\r\nsmoked by day and flamed by night. But Virgil, laboriously seeking\r\nnoisy-sounding words, confuses the two. The Greek says plainly that\r\nfountains of fire are belched forth, and rivers of smoke flow, and\r\nyellow, curling volumes of flame are borne down to the shores of the sea\r\nlike fiery snakes; but this fellow of ours, choosing to interpret ῥόον\r\nκαπνοῦ αἴθωνα by _atram nubem turbine piceo et favilla fumantem_, makes\r\na crass and clumsy mixture, and translates the κρουνοὺς of flames, both\r\nharshly and inexactly, into ‘globes.’ Again, when he talks of ‘licking\r\nthe stars,’ he makes an idle and empty exaggeration. Nay, the phrase,\r\n‘emitting a black cloud of smoke full of pitchy whirlwinds and glowing\r\nashes,’ is bad style and almost nonsense.[427] For glowing things, quoth\r\nhe, neither smoke nor are black; unless by an improper vulgarism he\r\napplies _candente_, not to glowing but to merely ‘hot’ ash. But when he\r\ntalks of ‘rocks and cliffs being belched and flung up,’ adding\r\nimmediately that they are ‘melted, and groan, and are flung in handfuls\r\ninto the air,’ neither did Pindar write this, nor would anybody else\r\nthink of saying it, and the thing is the most monstrous of all\r\nmonstrosities.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 426:\r\n\r\n  xvii. 10.\r\n\r\nFootnote 427:\r\n\r\n  _Inenarrabile et propemodum insensibile._\r\n\r\nThe classical hatred of bombast and the classical propensity to “stick\r\nat the word” in criticism are both very well illustrated here; but we\r\nshould hardly guess, from the sample, that there existed in classical\r\ntimes much power of grasping the literary and poetical merit of a\r\npassage as a whole. Virgil, if he had cared to defend himself, would, no\r\ndoubt, have called attention to the Pindaric words, τέρας and θαῦμα, as\r\njustifying even “monstrosity” in his own expanded description, and have\r\nurged that this description was at least partly intended to indicate the\r\nterror and confusion of mind caused by so portentous a phenomenon.\r\n\r\nBut this absence of the synoptic grasp of æsthetic means, as applied to\r\nproduce literary effect, is precisely what we notice most in the ancient\r\ncriticism which has come down to us. And it may be added that it is also\r\nprecisely what we should expect to follow from the limitations of the\r\nancient Rhetoric. Grammar provided rules for the arrangement of words,\r\nand lexicography provided lists of them, with their authority and their\r\nuse carefully ticketed; so here criticism was at home. Rhetoric provided\r\nlists of Figures with which a man could compare the passage before him.\r\nBut there was no training in the process of simply “submitting to” this\r\npassage, interrogating oneself whether it exercised a charm or not, and\r\nthen interrogating oneself further whether that charm was genuine, and\r\nwhat was its cause. After all, Gellius has, as we have seen, sometimes\r\ncome near to the discovery of the true method, and that he loved\r\nliterature there can be no doubt.[428]\r\n\r\nFootnote 428:\r\n\r\n  It may perhaps seem to those who know him well that he might have been\r\n  allowed more space here; and certainly he gives plentiful material.\r\n  But the individual importance of his items hardly requires more than\r\n  representative treatment.\r\n\r\nNor, much later, shall we find things different with that favourite of\r\nthe Middle Ages and of Dr Johnson’s youth, [Sidenote: _Macrobius: The_\r\nSaturnalia.] Macrobius,[429] who, about the beginning of the fifth\r\ncentury, undertook a pendant to the work of Gellius. It is not\r\nsurprising that the author, _qui ot nom Macrobes_,[430] should have been\r\na favourite (for his commentary on the _Somnium Scipionis_ principally,\r\nno doubt) with the period between Darkness and Renaissance. He has\r\nprecisely the “fine confused feeding” in the way of matter and manner\r\nthat these ages loved; and they would not be likely to quarrel with him\r\nfor his lack of the criticism which, as we shall see, they themselves\r\nhardly, in more than a single instance, relished or understood. But he\r\ncertainly illustrates, even in a greater degree than Gellius, the small\r\npropulsion of the Romans and their vassals towards the proper subjects\r\nof this book. Once more we find that etymology, mythology, grammar, the\r\n_farrago_ of the antiquary as distinguished from that of the literary\r\nenthusiast, of the philologist as opposed to the critic, receive ample\r\nattention. And, once more, what we are specially in quest of remains\r\npractically, if not entirely, unhandled.\r\n\r\nFootnote 429:\r\n\r\n  Ed. Eyssenhardt, Leipsic, 1883.\r\n\r\nFootnote 430:\r\n\r\n  _Roman de la Rose_, l. 7.\r\n\r\nThere are few more striking _loci_ in connection with this subject than\r\nthe end of the first book of the _Saturnalia_. The guests have been\r\ntalking mythology and etymology for some stricken hours, till at last a\r\nbreak occurs. Vettius Prætextatus, the host, has just ended a long\r\nmythological dissertation, to the admiration of everybody, when\r\nEuangelus (the irreverent humourist of the party) breaks in, with some\r\namusement at the practice of citing Virgil as an authority. He supposes\r\nthat the notion of making Latin poets into philosophers is an imitation\r\nof the Greeks, and hints that the process is dangerous, since even Tully\r\nhimself, who was as formal a professor of philosophising as of oratory,\r\nso often as he talks of the nature of the gods, or of fate, or of\r\ndivination, injures the glory which he has got together through his\r\neloquence, by his desultory handling of things. Symmachus, the\r\nscholar-statesman, rebukes this blasphemer gravely, observing that, as\r\nfor Cicero, he is _conviciis impenetrabilis_, and may be left aside for\r\nthe moment, but that he fears Euangelus has learnt his Virgil only as\r\nboys do, and thinks him only good for boys, with nothing higher in him.\r\nEuangelus is by no means abashed, and takes the offensive. It was all\r\nvery well, he says, for us as boys to take Virgil at our master’s\r\nvaluation, but did not he himself pronounce himself far from faultless,\r\ninasmuch as he wished them to burn the _Æneid_? No doubt he was afraid,\r\nnot merely of ethical blame for such scenes as the request of Venus to\r\nher lawful husband in favour of her illegitimate son, but of critical\r\nblame for his now Greek, now barbarous, diction, and for the awkward\r\n_ordonnance_ of his work. To this, _cum omnes exhorruissent_, Symmachus,\r\nstill calm and sententious, makes answer by putting Virgil beside\r\nCicero, and saying of his glory, that as it can grow by no one’s praise,\r\nso it is diminished by no one’s abuse. Any grammarian, he continues, can\r\nrefute these calumnies; and it would be a shame to ask Servius (the\r\nfamous Virgilian scholiast, who is present) to take the trouble. But he\r\nshould like to know whether, as Euangelus is dissatisfied with Virgil’s\r\nPoetic, he likes his Rhetoric better. “Oh!” says Euangelus, “you have\r\nmade him a philosopher, and now you are going to make him an orator, are\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\nA conversation of this kind gives us no bad reason to expect something\r\nlike literary criticism proper, something such as Coleridge has given us\r\nin the _Biographia Literaria_ in reference to Wordsworth. But Symmachus\r\nfor the time contents himself with undertaking to defend the Mantuan’s\r\nrhetoric, while the others overwhelm the impenitent Euangelus with a\r\nstring of affirmations as to the poet’s proficiency in politics, law,\r\naugury, astrological and other philosophy, fidelity to the traditions of\r\nthe Latin language, &c. But the justifications of these praises are\r\ndeferred by the announcement of dinner, and for a time the conversation\r\nturns to lighter subjects—the famous string of stories for which\r\nMacrobius is most commonly quoted, including scandal about Princess\r\nJulia. Only in the third book, and then, it would seem, after a lacuna,\r\nis the detailed criticism of Virgil resumed.\r\n\r\nThere is no occasion to find fault with the quantity of it, for it\r\nfills, with a digression or two of the lighter kind, such as that on the\r\ndessert when it appears, four whole books, and some two hundred and\r\nforty pages in Eyssenhardt’s text. But the quality is, at any rate from\r\nour point of view, not quite so satisfactory. Much simply consists in\r\ncitation of passages illustrating different “Figures.” A very large\r\npart, probably the largest, is mere and sheer quotation from Virgil\r\nhimself, from Homer, and from other poets, Latin and Greek, with whom he\r\nis compared. And the comparison is carried on almost, if not quite\r\nentirely, on that most unsatisfying parallel-passage system which, in\r\nits abuse, has ever since been the delight of the pedantic\r\ncriticaster—and the abomination of the true critic.\r\n\r\nOf course the parallel passage, rightly handled, is invaluable—is\r\npractically indispensable to true literary criticism. The “Truth”\r\npassages of the _Areopagitica_ and Halifax’s _Character of a Trimmer_,\r\nthe “Death” passages of Raleigh, Marston, and Lee, the different\r\nharmonies which the motive “Ask me no more” has suggested to Carew and\r\nTennyson, the accounts of the passing of Arthur or the parting of\r\nLancelot and Guinevere in Malory, and in his probable verse original,\r\nare the constant, the inexhaustible, texts and exercises of the critical\r\nfaculty. But I do not think it unfair to Macrobius to say that hardly in\r\na single occasion does he make any such use of his parallels. And in\r\nliterary criticism, properly so called, such parallels as\r\n\r\n                                    οὐδέ τις ἄλλη\r\n                φαίνετο γαιάων ἀλλ’ οὐρανὸς ἠδε θάλασσα,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n                                 “Nec jam amplius ulla\r\n           apparet tellus, cælum undique et undique pontus,”\r\n\r\nare all but valueless. They merely show what might be demonstrated once\r\nfor all in a page—what does not need demonstrating to any intelligent\r\nperson who has read fifty lines of the two poets—that Virgil was an\r\nexcellent translator, and was, rather more frequently than becomes a\r\ngreat poet, content simply to translate.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the matter lies, for the most part if not wholly, as much as\r\nthis or more in the uttermost precincts of literary criticism proper.\r\nThe illustrations of Virgil’s attention to that religious ritual and\r\nliturgical language which was so important at Rome are very curious,\r\nvery interesting, very valuable but they scarcely touch the fringe of\r\nliterature: a Roman Blackmore could be as prolific of them as the Roman\r\nDryden.\r\n\r\nThe contents of Book IV. may, perhaps, be urged against me; and I shall\r\nconfess that they come nearer to a certain conception of literary\r\ncriticism. But I should reply that this conception itself is an argument\r\non the side I am taking. One of the gaps, common at the opening of the\r\nbooks of the _Saturnalia_, plunges us into the midst of a demonstration\r\nof Virgil’s pathos, that word being sometimes used in the Greek plural\r\n_pathe_, and referring to the Rhetorical “passions” appealed to. We\r\nfind, however, almost directly, that the citations are only applied to\r\nillustrate and enforce Virgil’s technical command of rhetoric, as\r\nSymmachus had foreshadowed. The parts are accordingly dealt out in the\r\northodox way between accuser and defendant, and the passages quoted are\r\ndistributed once more under figures—Irony, Hyperbole, and the rest.\r\nThis, of course, is literary criticism after a fashion, though a fashion\r\nwhich Quintilian had already treated with some disdain (abandoning it\r\nalmost entirely in the best parts of his own critical work), and which\r\nLonginus, though he too was not quite bold enough to discard it\r\nentirely, avoids, either cunningly or instinctively, in all his best\r\npassages. Macrobius and his distinguished company seem to wish for\r\nnothing better, and after they have complacently ticked off the sorts\r\nand sources of the pathos—time, place, circumstance, age, mood, manner,\r\nand so forth—they decide triumphantly, at the beginning of the Fifth\r\nBook, that Virgil must be held no less of an orator than of a poet.\r\nIndeed, Eusebius, who has conducted the rhetorical inquiry, draws a neat\r\nparallel between Virgil and Cicero himself. The eloquence, he says, of\r\nthe Mantuan is multiplex and multiform, and comprehends every kind of\r\nspeech. In your Cicero [Eusebius of course is a Greek] there is one\r\ntenor of eloquence, the abundant, and torrential, and copious. For the\r\nnature of orators is not uniform, but one flows and overflows, another\r\naffects a brief and concise manner. The thin and dry and sober speaker\r\nloves, as it were, a parsimony of words, his rival revels in full and\r\nflorid and amply illustrated rhetoric. Virgil is the only man who, while\r\nothers are so dissimilar, blends his own eloquence of every kind. And he\r\nsubsequently distributes these kinds more specially to Cicero, Sallust,\r\nFronto, and the younger Pliny. The passage which follows, for three or\r\nfour pages, till the scoffer Euangelus brings on the Homeric parallels\r\nby asking whether they think a Venetian farmer’s boy is likely to have\r\nknown Greek literature, is one of the most literary in the book. But it\r\nis (as a devil’s advocate must point out) curious and a little\r\nunfortunate that once more we find the subject drawn, as it were,\r\nirresistibly to the oratorical side. In no other branch of literature,\r\nit seems, could a Roman or a late Greek (which Macrobius probably was)\r\ntaste the _minutiæ_ of difference, the savours and qualities which\r\nconcern criticism proper. Elsewhere he “stuck in letters,” or in\r\nFigures, or in the merest schematic construction of prosody, or in the\r\nmatter, as opposed to the form and spirit, of the literature.\r\n\r\nAnother piece of criticism, proper if not consummate, will be found in\r\nthe seventeenth chapter of the Fifth Book, in the shape of a fresh\r\ncomparison, to be itself compared with that cited above from Gellius,\r\nbetween Pindar’s Ætna, in the First Pythian and Virgil’s in the third\r\n_Æneid_. It is an even weaker piece. For the critic, a Greek, cavils at\r\nVirgil quite in the Rymer-and-Dennis style, not merely because he speaks\r\nof an _atram nubem_ as _fumantem candente favilla_, but (exactly as if\r\nhe were an eighteenth-century French critic speaking of Shakespeare)\r\nbecause the poet actually indulges in such shocking words as _eructans_.\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Book deals with Virgil’s borrowing of diction and phrase from\r\nthe older Latin poets, and has, of course, great linguistic, and a\r\ncertain portion of literary, interest. But it is again remarkable how\r\nlittle this latter is improved or worked out. As in the Homeric case,\r\nthe literary interest of the fact that Virgil was content simply to\r\n“lift” Ennian phrases, like _stellis fulgentibus_ or _tollitur in cælum\r\nclamor_, is limited to the demonstration that Virgil “stole his brooms\r\nready made,” as the Berkshire broom-squire did. And no attempt is made\r\n(as might easily have been done, and in fairness to Virgil should have\r\nbeen done) to show the taste with which the poet selected beautiful\r\nwords and happy phrases. Servius, later in the book, has some not\r\nuninteresting verbal criticism, but attempts nothing more. In fact, in\r\nall this bulk of work there is not as much literary criticism in the\r\nproper sense as Longinus has often given us in a paragraph, and hardly\r\nan attempt at even that general characterisation which we find sometimes\r\nin Gellius and still more in Quintilian. The place and power of Virgil\r\nremain untouched, or are referred to only in the vaguest\r\nconventionalisms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Servius on Virgil._]\r\n\r\nOne of the contributors, as has been said, to the Macrobian symposium is\r\nno less a person than Maurus (or Marius) Servius Honoratus, the greatest\r\ncommentator on the greatest Latin poet in general repute, and obviously,\r\nfrom the figure he makes in the _Saturnalia_, a man held in very high\r\nesteem for erudition and ability. We have his commentary,[431] together\r\nwith those of other ancient commentators of less repute. They are\r\nextremely voluminous;[432] they are, and always have been, justly\r\nrespected for their value in the interpretation of the poet. Servius had\r\nbefore him, and undoubtedly used, a very large bulk of precedent\r\nannotation, and represents, almost fully, the “Variorum” editor of\r\nmodern times. We might therefore expect to find in him, if not something\r\nlike the proceedings and results of Mr Furness in his _Shakespeare_, at\r\nany rate something like those of the Johnson-Malone time. Let us see\r\nwhat we actually do find. He gives us, at the very first, a definition\r\nof the duties of a critical editor, in which, on the face of it, there\r\nis very little to blame. The life of the poet; the titles of his work;\r\nthe quality of the poem; the intention of the writer; the number of the\r\nbooks, the order of them, the explanation of them. Looking at this\r\noff-hand, one may wonder a little at the elevation to co-ordinate\r\nhonours of the number and order of the books, and of course perceive\r\nthat _qualitas carminis_, the critical point, is susceptible of rather\r\nwidely differing interpretations as a promise. In the vague modern sense\r\nof “quality”—a sense, too, not absolutely unknown in ancient times—it\r\ncovers by itself almost all that the most accomplished and wide-ranging\r\ncriticism—the criticism of Coleridge or of Arnold, of Hazlitt or of\r\nSainte-Beuve—can extend unto. In the narrow technical sense of the Greek\r\nποιότης, it comes to very little more than the mere technical\r\nclassification of the piece as epic or what not, and offers us food as\r\nlittle sappy with critical juice as the most arid distinctions of\r\nRhetoric.\r\n\r\nFootnote 431:\r\n\r\n  Ed. Lion, 2 vols., Göttingen, 1826.\r\n\r\nFootnote 432:\r\n\r\n  The edition just quoted contains, without its indices, all but 1000\r\n  pages of very close and small print.\r\n\r\nBut we have barely turned a page when the sense in which Servius\r\nunderstands the comparative extent of the duties he has so lucidly\r\nmapped out breaks upon us. The “life,” brief and business-like, leaves\r\nno special room for complaint except to anecdote-mongers. But all the\r\nrest, except the “explanation,” is huddled up in less than a page, and\r\nin forms as succinct as the answers to a catechism. Title? “Æneis,”\r\nderived from Æneas, cf. Juvenal’s “Theseis.” Quality? Quite clear: the\r\nmetre is heroic, the action “mixed” (_i.e._, the poet sometimes speaks\r\nhimself, sometimes introduces others speaking). It is also Heroic,\r\nbecause it contains a mixture of divine and human things, of truth and\r\nfiction. For Æneas really did come to Italy, but clearly the poet made\r\nit up[433] when he represented Venus speaking to Jupiter, or the mission\r\nof Mercury. The style is grandiloquent—that is to say, the phrase is\r\nlofty and the sentiments noble. Besides, are there not three kinds of\r\nspeaking, the low, the middle, the grand? This is the grand style.\r\nVirgil intended first to imitate Homer, then to magnify the ancestry of\r\nAugustus (proofs of this latter given). Here there is no dispute about\r\nthe number of the author’s books, though in other cases (such as that of\r\nPlautus) there is. And there is not much doubt about the order, though a\r\nmere crotcheteer might put them in the order 2, 3, 1, in his ignorance\r\nthat the art of the poet consists in beginning at the middle and\r\nanticipating the future (see Horace). This shows that Virgil was a\r\nskilful bard. That is all. _Sola superest explanatio quæ in sequenti\r\nexpositione probabitur._\r\n\r\nFootnote 433:\r\n\r\n  _Constat esse compositum._\r\n\r\n_Sola superest explanatio!_ All, except the mere verbal part, is swept\r\naside, as settled and done for, in these thirty or forty lines. Of the\r\n_quality_, in the fuller and higher sense, of the Virgilian art nothing;\r\nnothing of its comparative value even with that of Homer himself, still\r\nless of other Greeks, or with that of Ennius, of Lucretius, of Statius,\r\nof the scores of Roman epic or “heroic” poets whom and whose books\r\nServius had before him, while their names only are before us. Nothing of\r\nhis way of managing his metre, his diction, his prosopopœia, his\r\nscenery, his dialogue. And in the settlement of the questions that are\r\nattacked, the most schoolboy-like abstinence from anything but reference\r\nto stock authorities, stock classifications. Nothing, for instance, one\r\nwould think, would be easier and more attractive, for a man who thinks\r\nthat Virgil’s is the grand style, than to prove it to be so, nothing\r\nmore curious and fascinating than to reply to the objections of those\r\nwho think it is not, if there be such heretics (and, as we know from the\r\nEuangelus of the _Saturnalia_, there were such, even in those days). But\r\nno glimpse or glimmer of any such thing enters the mind of our\r\nscholiast. There are, everybody allows, three styles: Low, Middle, and\r\nGrand. Nobody calls Virgil low; you surely would not call him middle;\r\ntherefore he must be grand. Q.E.D.; and demonstrated it is most\r\nmathematically. Then what kind of poem is it? You run your finger down\r\nthe official list of kinds and find “Heroic; written in hexameters and\r\ndealing with mixed kinds.” Virgil is in hexameters, but _is_ he mixed?\r\nLet us run the careful finger down yet another table, “Mixed: that which\r\nis partly divine and partly human, partly false, partly true.” Let us\r\nsee whether this will apply to Virgil. It does. Then Virgil is Heroic.\r\nNext, about order and so forth. Ought not Books II. and III., which tell\r\nthe voyage of Æneas up to the events recorded in the opening of Book I.,\r\nto come before it? This gives a moment’s pause, but let us look at our\r\nHorace—_Ut jam nunc dicat_, and so forth. Once more, we need not trouble\r\nourselves: the order is all right.\r\n\r\nTo some readers this account may savour of flippancy; and to them it is\r\nimpossible to offer any excuse. To others, who may not be likely to take\r\nthe trouble to read Servius for themselves, it will be enough to say\r\nthat practically nothing is put in his mouth which he does not say, that\r\nhis method is hardly caricatured even in form. It is one of the best\r\nillustrations we have, or could reasonably expect to have, of the whole\r\nsystem of ancient criticism, save in its very greatest examples, and to\r\nsome extent even in these. You construct, or accept from tradition as\r\nalready constructed, a vast classification of terms and kinds,\r\nhierarchically arranged; and when a subject presents itself you simply\r\nrefer it to the classification. Practically no intellectual labour is\r\nrequired, and still less—a mere minus quantity indeed—of cultivation of\r\nthe æsthetic sentiment. The necessary cards, with the necessary\r\ndescriptions on them, are in cell B or A, compartment _x_ or _y_, case 3\r\nor 5, room I. or VI. You take them out and you tie them on, and there’s\r\nan end of the matter. Nay, some fifteen hundred years after Servius,\r\nthere are other authorities who conduct criticism—and are indignant when\r\nit is not conducted—in the very self-same way.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be said, _superest explanatio_; the explanation does remain,\r\nand there may be much in that. In point of bulk there is very much; in\r\npoint of value there is a great deal; but in point of strict criticism\r\nthere is simply nothing, though the same reference to card, and cell,\r\nand compartment, and case abounds, as thus:—\r\n\r\n_Arma virumque._ _Arma_ means “war”: it is the trope called Metonymy. So\r\n_toga_, for “peace,” see Cic. As for _Arma virumque_, it is another\r\nfigure—that by which we change the order: some call it Hyperbaton. The\r\nwhole phrase is a professive poetic beginning; _Musa_, &c., an\r\ninvocative, and _urbs antiqua_ a narrative. As for _virum_, he does not\r\nmention the name, but indicates the person circumstantially. And now, as\r\nThackeray says somewhere, “we know all about it, and can proceed” to\r\nwrite the exordium of an Æneid.\r\n\r\nFar, very far, be it from me to speak with any ignorant or vulgar\r\ncontempt of Servius. His erudition is very great; his verbal expositions\r\nare almost always very sound and grammatical; but for him we should lack\r\na whole world of traditional information, without which the meaning of\r\nVirgil would either be entirely dark to us, or attainable only by the\r\nrashest of guesswork. And it must be admitted that according to the\r\n“figure” system of criticising he is, as the Roman orators say,\r\n_accuratissimus_. When Virgil, as he so often does, borrows a phrase\r\nfrom Ennius with a slight alteration, Servius points out that it is an\r\n_acyrologia_, and no doubt feels much comforted by the fact. Something\r\nelse is an _amblysia_ (a “blunting,” lessening, _litotes_). There are\r\nderivations, anticipating the modern philologist, of the most scientific\r\nkind, as that of _consilia_ for _considia_, because people’s minds\r\nbecome quieter when they sit down. There is, indeed, a very great deal\r\nof miscellaneous information of all kinds.\r\n\r\nBut of criticism nothing, or less than nothing. Occasionally, at the\r\nbeginning of the books, it does seem to occur to the excellent\r\ncommentator that something more may be expected of him. Especially, and\r\nindeed most naturally, is this the case with the Fourth. He tells us,\r\nquite properly, that Apollonius had written an _Argonautica_, and that\r\nthe whole book is borrowed from it.[434] It is; a fact of which those\r\npersons who (having better knowledge than Dante had) still take Virgil\r\nfor a supreme poet might perhaps take more notice than they have usually\r\ntaken. But to Servius, and persons of Servius’ way of thinking, there\r\nwould not have been much in this. He goes on. It is almost entirely in\r\naffection, though it has pathos in the end, where the departure of Æneas\r\nbegets sorrow. It consists entirely in counsels and subtleties. The\r\nstyle is very nearly comic—which is not surprising, considering that it\r\ntreats of love. But there is a proper junction with the former book,\r\nwhich is a proof of art, as we have often said. An abrupt transition is\r\na bad transition, though some people foolishly say that this junction is\r\nnot well managed, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nFootnote 434:\r\n\r\n  The enthusiastic Maronite usually\r\n\r\n  One may be, I hope without affectation, a little aghast at this. urges\r\n  that not the whole is conveyed, and that Virgil combines his\r\n  conveyances. Let it be so.\r\n\r\nGrant that Virgil shows his want of originality by his relying on\r\nApollonius. Grant that in the delineation of Dido’s tragic “All for Love\r\nand the World well Lost” for such a tame scoundrel as Æneas, he has none\r\nof the lightning strokes of Lucretius or Catullus. Yet most of us think\r\nthat the Fourth book is a great thing, some that it is a much greater\r\nthing than the _Æneid_ of which it forms part. Servius might think, was\r\nentitled to think, and has the consent of many respectable moderns in\r\nthinking, differently. But it does not appear that he thought about it\r\nat all. He found in his books a distinction between “affection” and\r\n“pathos,” and applied it. He had learnt from the same books that Love\r\nwas an inferior subject, Comedy an inferior style, and the former a\r\nproper theme of the latter. So the Fourth book, with its steady rise\r\ntowards the hopeless, the hapless, the inevitable end, is _pæne\r\ncomicus_. Certainly the criticism is, from our point of view.\r\n\r\nBut the very value of Servius, as of so many other writers, is precisely\r\nthis, that he is _not_ writing from our point of view, that he is\r\nwriting from a point of view entirely different. When he annotates _Est\r\nin secessu_ “_Topothesia_ est—_i.e._, fictus secundum poeticam licentiam\r\nlocus.... Nam _topographia_ est rei veræ descriptio,” it may be\r\ndifficult to repress a smile. So also when he points out, in respect to\r\none of Anna’s speeches to Dido, not that it is touching, or eloquent, or\r\nindicative of a wonderful knowledge of the human heart, and an equally\r\nwonderful grasp of pathetic expression, but that it is regular\r\nRhetoric—_suasione omni parte plena; nam purgat objecta, et ostendit\r\nutilitatem, et a timore persuadet_. But, after all, he is only playing\r\nhis own game, not ours. It is impossible, or at any rate very difficult,\r\nto be sure whether it is in innocent unconsciousness or dry humour that\r\nhe quotes, without comment, the objection to the phrase _nepos Veneris_\r\nthat it is unbecoming to represent Venus as a grandmother. Again, in one\r\nof his short prefaces to the Seventh book—at the point when, to modern\r\nreaders, the interest of the _Æneid_ is all but over, and the romantic\r\nwanderings of Æneas, the passion of the Fourth book, the majesty and\r\nmagnificence of the Sixth, are exchanged for the kite-and-crow battles\r\nof Trojans and Rutulians, the doll-like figure of Lavinia, and the\r\nunjust fate of the hero Turnus at the hands of a divinely helped\r\ninvader—he tells us that the earlier books have been like the _Odyssey_\r\n(as indeed they are), not because of the romantic interest, which of\r\ncourse he did not see, but as being _graviores varietate personarum et\r\nallocutionum_, while the last books are like the _Iliad_, as being\r\n_negotiis validiores_!\r\n\r\nSo, again, the relatively long preface to the _Bucolics_ tells us that\r\nthe word comes from the Greek for oxen, which are the principal rustical\r\nanimals; that these poems were invented in the time of Xerxes, when the\r\nLaconians (one does not quite see why, as Xerxes never landed in the\r\nPeloponnese) were kept to their walls or the mountains; that the\r\n_qualitas_ is a _humilis character_, thus, with the _medius_ of the\r\n_Georgics_, vindicating all the three styles for Virgil. For we must not\r\nrequire lofty speaking from humble rustics. He then gives us a curious\r\nspecimen of the critical punctiliousness in matters of mint, anise, and\r\ncumin which accompanied blindness to weightier things. In bucolic verse\r\nthere ought, it seems, to be a pause at the fourth foot; and if that\r\nfoot is a dactyl so much the better; and it is better also that the\r\nfirst foot should be a dactyl and included in the word, and so forth.\r\n\r\nFor a final specimen he tells us, in the corresponding introduction to\r\nthe _Georgics_ themselves, that as Virgil had followed Homer, and had\r\nnot come near him in the _Æneid_, as he had followed Theocritus and run\r\na good second in the _Eclogues_, so he followed Hesiod, and “simply left\r\nhim” (_penitus reliquit_) in the _Georgics_. It required enormous skill\r\nto do what he has done. (So far so good, but before very long we come\r\nagain to the parting of the ways.) The book is didactic, and therefore\r\nit should be written to somebody, for teaching presupposes two\r\npersonages—the teacher and the taught. Again, one does not know whether\r\nto smile or not, to take the matter gravely and urge that any _lector\r\nbenevolus_ will occupy quite sufficiently the _personam discipuli_, or\r\nto pass the matter, _olli subridens_, and reflecting that our legs also\r\nare not unexposed to the arrows.\r\n\r\nIt can scarcely be necessary to take special examples from the minor\r\ncommentators on Virgil or on other Latin poets: for their\r\ncharacteristics are, so far as I know, exactly uniform with [Sidenote:\r\n_Other commentators._] those of Servius and with those of the Greek\r\nscholiasts. In explanation of words and things diligent to admiration,\r\nand extremely serviceable, if not always (according to modern standards,\r\nwhich are very likely temporary) scientific. In matters of prosody\r\nexcellently minute and regular, though occasionally a little arbitrary.\r\nNot very seldom careful, to an almost touching extent, of referring\r\nphrases to the accepted categories of Figure, and applying the stock\r\nRhetorical divisions and classifications. But not merely in the higher,\r\nbut even in the middle regions of criticism proper, so meagre that they\r\nmay almost be called entirely to seek. Quite rudimentary in Comparison;\r\nin indicating character, content to accept stock divisions, and not even\r\nattempting individual _signalement_. Abstaining with such uniformity\r\nthat one can easily perceive the entire absence of any demand for it,\r\nfrom, any attempt to deal with the literary beauty of phrase or of\r\npassage, to bring out its effect on the reader, to estimate it as a work\r\nof art, like a picture or a statue. And now and then, as we have seen,\r\nnot merely not applying the right, but applying totally wrong, tests to\r\nliterature and especially to poetry, demanding from this latter\r\ncompliance with the arbitrary requirements of traditional Rhetoric, and\r\npraising it for such compliance. Are they to be blamed for all this?\r\nCertainly not; no one is to be blamed for not doing what he never\r\nintended to do and what nobody wanted him to do, for doing what was his\r\ncommission and his business. But they are to be cited, and examined, and\r\nrecorded as witnesses to prove that, for the most part at any rate,\r\ncriticism, in the best and highest sense, was what no critic thought of\r\ngiving, and no reader thought of demanding, under the Latin\r\ndispensation.\r\n\r\nIt may not be uninteresting to accompany (as we did in the case of\r\nGreek) this view of the later criticism, more or less formal, with some\r\naccount of the poets where they touch the subject. These touches are not\r\nfrequent or important, but we find some in Ausonius for the end of the\r\nfourth century, and in the curious collection bearing (with what\r\nimparity of suggested contrast!) the title of the Latin Anthology, and\r\nsupposed to have been put together at Carthage, at the end of the fifth,\r\nor a little later.\r\n\r\nThe unequal and decadent, but sometimes fascinating, author[435] of the\r\n_Mosella_ and the _Cupido cruci affixus_, of the two charming epigrams\r\nto wife and mistress—\r\n\r\n                “Uxor vivamus,”\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n                “Deformem quidam te dicunt, Crispa”—\r\n\r\nhas, in his epigrams themselves, followed Martial in directions where he\r\nis a less blameless guide than in his literary criticism. [Sidenote:\r\n_Ausonius._] But he has not followed him here; and though much of the\r\ncollection is simply a translation of the Greek Anthology, I do not\r\nremember any literary following thereof. But the curious verse\r\ncelebration of what we may call the University of Bordeaux, with its\r\n“commemoration,” in separate pieces of varying length and metre, of a\r\ncouple of dozen of Professors; the Fourth Idyll, to his namesake and\r\ngrandson on his studies; and the Epistles, especially those to Paullus\r\nthe Rhetor and to Tetradius, all have more or less to do with the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nFootnote 435:\r\n\r\n  Ausonius received little attention from scholars till very recently;\r\n  and I know him only, as I have long known him, in the Delphin edition\r\n  and the _Corpus Poetarum_. There are now, however, I believe, editions\r\n  by Peiper, Leipsic, 1886, and Schenkl, Berlin, 1883, besides\r\n  monographs.\r\n\r\nWe find, and are not surprised to find, that of the Professors at\r\nBordeaux the majority are Professors of Rhetoric. Compliment has\r\nnaturally rather the better of criticism in the addresses to them, but\r\ncertain things emerge. Tib. Victor Minervius is “another Quintilian,”\r\nespecially for fluency and for the _Demosthenicum_ (I suppose δεινότης);\r\nbut it is a little suspicious that the fullest praise is given to his\r\n_memory_. Latinus Alcimus Alethius seems to have been himself a careful\r\ncritic, and appears to have written specially on Sallust and on the\r\nEmperor Julian—perhaps the books are somewhere? Attius Patera was “a\r\ndescendant of the Druids,” and we should have been glad to know whether\r\nhe displayed that “Celtic spirit” in literature of which we have heard\r\nmore than enough in these days. But Ausonius is vague as the Celtic\r\nvague itself. Attius Tiro Delphinius was a poet as well as an orator.\r\nOthers—the dead Luciolus, Alethius Minervius the Younger, the Grammarian\r\nLentulus, “_cognomine Lascivus_” (quite innocent, Ausonius tells us),\r\nhis brother Jucundus, are more generally commended. Pieces, two grouped\r\nand some single, to the Greek and the Latin grammarians of Bordeaux—show\r\nthat the languages, as well as the literatures, received plentiful\r\nattention. The compliment to Exuperius of Toulouse goes closer, and is\r\ndecidedly double-edged.[436] Erudition is specially attributed to\r\nStaphylius, who knew not only Livy and Herodotus, but “all that is\r\nstored in the thousand volumes of Varro” (_sexcentis_, of course). It is\r\nobservable that the grammarians[437] appear to have chiefly lectured on\r\npoetry, the Rhetors on prose, and the whole, with touches numerous, if\r\nnot very definite, suggests to us a study liberal enough, but perhaps\r\nnot very wide, rather undiscriminating. The Idyll to his nephew enters\r\nnaturally into a few more particulars. A generous but general incitement\r\nto the study of the tongues is followed by detail. The, as it seems to\r\nus, very odd conjunction of Homer and Menander is an additional\r\ntestimony to the popularity of the great New Comic. It can hardly be\r\naccidental, for it is separated by some lines from any other mention. In\r\nfact, Ausonius is not prodigal of names, only those of Horace, Virgil,\r\nand Terence being mentioned for Latin poetry, and the work, though not\r\nthe name, of Sallust, with some other histories of the last Republican\r\nperiod. Lastly, the Epistles, besides supplying fresh instances of\r\nAusonius’ _rococo_ fancy for the cento—even the Macaronic cento—supply a\r\nperhaps humorous prose criticism in form of his own work, which is worth\r\nsubjoining.[438]\r\n\r\nFootnote 436:\r\n\r\n  He has praised him (Prof. xvii.) his stately walk, his _verba\r\n  ingentia_, his handsome dress, and adds—\r\n\r\n              “Copia cui fandi longe pulcherrima: _quam si\r\n              Auditu tenus acciperes deflata placeret.\r\n              Discussam scires solidi nihil edere sensus_.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 437:\r\n\r\n  It may be barely necessary to append the caution that _grammaticus_ is\r\n  a good deal more than “grammarian” in the most limited sense,\r\n  including “philologist,” “critic,” &c. Some preferred _literatus_, as\r\n  the Latin word.\r\n\r\nFootnote 438:\r\n\r\n  _In verbis rudem; in eloquendo hiulcum; a propositis discrepantem; in\r\n  versibus concinnationis expertum, in cavillando natura invenustum nec\r\n  arte conditum; diluti salis et fellis ignavi; nec de mimo planipedem\r\n  nec de comœdis histrionem._.\r\n\r\nThe _Anthologia Latina_,[439] which a certain noble youth of the name of\r\nOctavian composed at the bidding of some Vandal [Sidenote: _The_\r\nAnthologia Latina.] chieftain, perhaps as late as 532, at the extreme\r\nverge of the twilight of the West, is not entirely deserving of the\r\ntransferred sense attached to its patron’s nationality. It has preserved\r\none or two pretty things for us, and more curious ones. And, in our\r\nparticular relation, it shows that literary society and occupation had\r\nby no means gone wholly out of fashion. Both with individuals and\r\ncoteries Virgil was a perversely favourite subject; and the deplorable\r\npersons who called themselves the Twelve Wise Men wrote distichs, and\r\npentastichs, and polystichs, _à dormir debout_, on the contents of the\r\nbooks of the _Æneid_ and other subjects. The epigrams attributed to\r\nSeneca are probably, whether they belong to any of the known Senecas or\r\nnot, of an older and better time; and the pair (Nos. 27 and 28) on the\r\ntheme of _Ære perennius_, though the sentiment is of course a\r\ncommonplace, have a grip and ring of style which, at any rate after the\r\nflaccid barbarisms of the sixth century, shows well. But for the\r\nliterary taste of this time itself, the works of a certain Luxorius (a\r\ncontemporary it would seem, and, from the word _spectabilis_, probably\r\nof official rank) are most valuable. They are of some bulk, consisting\r\nof not much less than a hundred pieces, filling some forty pages in\r\nBaehrens’s edition. The body of the work, according to the usual _prava\r\ndocilitas_ of the epigrammatist, consists of things licentious or\r\ntrivial enough; but Luxorius had read his Martial in this respect more\r\nclosely than Ausonius, that he begins with three or four pieces of a\r\ncritical or semi-critical kind. He is thoroughly convinced of the danger\r\nof writing after the ancients; but, as he says with some force to the\r\nReader, “If you think them of better quality, why don’t you read them\r\nand not me?” He consoles his book, should it meet with contempt at Rome\r\nand Carthage, with the observation that things must be content with\r\ntheir proper places; and in a fourth piece pleads that if his epigrams\r\nare short, why, the reading will be the sooner finished. The tone, with\r\na good deal less disguised conceit, is very much that of a literary\r\n_abbé_ or President of the eighteenth century—a kind of person with\r\nwhose general tastes, literary and other, Luxorius would probably have\r\nsympathised well enough.\r\n\r\nFootnote 439:\r\n\r\n  _Poetæ Latini Minores_, ed. Baehrens, vol. iv. Sidonius Apollinaris,\r\n  who comes between Ausonius and the Anthology, and has much concern for\r\n  us, is deliberately postponed to the next Book.\r\n\r\nWe may now complete our survey of the actual documents by dealing with\r\nsuch remnants as we have of the technical [Sidenote: _The Latin\r\nRhetoricians._] treatises on Rhetoric in Latin. These are neither\r\nnumerous nor bulky, nor, with one exception at the very end of the\r\nclassical, and gate of the mediæval, period (to which latter some of\r\nthem even belong), of much interest or importance. The fact may seem a\r\nlittle surprising, in face of the immense interest in the practice of\r\nthe subject, which not merely Seneca, and Quintilian, and Pliny, but all\r\nothers, show. But the surprise will vanish at a little consideration.\r\nBefore the Romans attempted it, the technical part of Rhetoric had been\r\nreduced, as we saw, to a settled scheme of extreme intricacy by the\r\nGreeks, and these claimed to be as much the masters of the subject as\r\nJews were of Medicine in the Middle Ages. Probably every Roman, though\r\nhe might attend his own countrymen’s declamations, learnt the art of\r\nRhetoric from a Greek professor at one time or another, and was familiar\r\nwith the Greek _technæ_. It was only after the separation of the\r\nEmpires, and not even immediately then, that Greek ceased to be the\r\nlanguage of education. Moreover, the Romans, though of orderly and\r\nbusiness-like habits of thought, had neither the liking nor the language\r\nsuited for the intenser and minuter technicalities of the Art.\r\n\r\nIt may be almost sufficient justification of the last paragraph to\r\nmention that the whole body of Latin Rhetoricians, as given in the\r\nstandard edition of Capperonnier,[440] fills but a volume of some 400\r\nnot very large quarto pages; and that this is made up by the insertion\r\nnot merely of the Rhetorical part of Martianus Capella, but of such\r\npurely mediæval or “Dark Age” work as that of Bede, Isidore, and\r\npossibly Alcuin. These latter will find better place in the next Book.\r\nMartianus shall be noticed by himself presently; we may meanwhile run\r\nover the rest.\r\n\r\nFootnote 440:\r\n\r\n  _Rhetores Latini_ (Argentorati, 1756). It is, however, worth while to\r\n  substitute, or add, the newer edition of Halm (2 vols., Leipsic,\r\n  1863), which gives not only critical apparatus and very useful\r\n  indices, but some more texts from MSS. Ernesti’s _Lexicon Technologiæ\r\n  Latinorum Rhetoricæ_ (Lips., 1795) is only less necessary than its\r\n  Greek companion, inasmuch as Latin-English lexicographers have been\r\n  less neglectful of rhetorical vocabulary than Greek-English—but still\r\n  necessary.\r\n\r\nThe first in order, and perhaps the oldest, is the Treatise on the\r\nFigures of P. Rutilius Lupus, a rhetorician often quoted [Sidenote:\r\n_Rutilius Lupus, &c._] by Quintilian. It is in the dictionary form, but\r\nnot alphabetically arranged. The definitions are technical, meagre, and\r\nchiefly limited to that jejune splitting of kinds which has been noticed\r\nunder the head of Greek. The illustrative quotations, which are numerous\r\nand not useless, are wholly from Greek authors, many of them indicating\r\nby their time that the Gorgias, whose four books Quintilian tells us\r\nthat Rutilius abstracted into one, was not the sophist of Leontini, but\r\na later Athenian rhetorician. Except for the close connection\r\nwhich—until quite recently if not still—has existed between the Figures\r\nand criticism, this has little interest for us.\r\n\r\nThe next treatise, that of Aquila Romanus, is in the same way only a\r\nLatin accommodation of the work of Alexander (_v. supra_, p. 102). It is\r\nof the same class, a non-alphabetical dictionary in miniature, and\r\ndevoted to the same subject. Of the same class again, exactly, is the\r\ntractate of Julius Rufinianus, who, since he keeps, as Rutilius and\r\nAquila had not done, the Greek words _schema_ for _figura_, and _lexis_\r\nfor _elocutio_, was probably a closer adapter, paraphrast, or translator\r\nof his original even than they. He has added a short parallel treatment\r\nof the other division of _schemata_, the intellectual or dianoetic.\r\n\r\nCurius or Chirius Fortunatianus (a writer at any rate senior to\r\nCassiodorus, who epitomised him) was more ambitious, [Sidenote: _Curius\r\nFortunatianus: his Catechism._] and instead of confining himself to the\r\nFigures, composed a regular art of the Rhetoric of the Schools in three\r\nbooks. It supplies an interesting and early example of the catechetical\r\nform which was so popular during the middle ages, which continued to\r\nflourish till within the memory of the present generation, and the\r\ndisuse of which has certainly been accompanied by a loss in exactness of\r\nactual knowledge, compensated, or not, by a gain in the philosophical\r\ncharacter of such as is acquired.\r\n\r\n“Q. What is Rhetoric? A. The science of speaking well. Q. What is an\r\norator? A. A good man skilled in speaking. Q. What is the duty of an\r\norator? A. To speak well in civil cases. Q. What is his end? A. To\r\npersuade so far as the condition of things and persons allows.”\r\n\r\nAnd so forth—the writer proceeding by the simple method of throwing into\r\ncatechism-form the same kind of dictionary matter which we have just\r\nnoticed, sometimes with very odd effect, as in _Quæ est anæschyntos?_—a\r\nquestion which, if Mrs. Quickly had heard it and had understood Greek,\r\nwould doubtless have made her adjust to the occasion her objection to\r\n“Jenny’s case.” The thing, though curious, drags Rhetoric farther out of\r\nits proper course than ever, and one perhaps at no time feels more\r\ninclined to join in the contempt of scholastic methods, mistaken as one\r\nknows it to be, than when reading such questions as—_Assumpta qualitas\r\nfacit statum?_ and the rest of this liturgy of abracadabra in\r\ncatechetical form. In no rhetorical treatise, indeed, is the question of\r\nstyle so unceremoniously ignored. A long handling of the _staseis_ is\r\nfollowed by shorter ones of other technical divisions, “Elocution”\r\nreceiving the most perfunctory treatment possible (though with a certain\r\npracticality). How are you to acquire diction? By reading, speaking,\r\nhearing others speak, and inventing new words (which must not be done\r\ntoo often). Put your long words last; but begin a sentence if you can\r\nwith a long syllable, and do not keep too many short ones, or too many\r\nmonosyllables, together; avoid archaisms; and attend to such minute, but\r\nin at least some cases arbitrary, rules as the following[441]:—\r\n\r\n“Let your construction be more frequently round than flat; let it not\r\ngape with too frequent collision of vowels, especially long ones; nor be\r\nrough with the conflict of two consonants; let not many monosyllables be\r\njoined together; let there be no great stretch of short syllables nor\r\nmany long ones; let not the first syllable of a word be the same as the\r\nlast of the word before, nor let the two together make any awkward\r\ncompound; let not the oration be deformed by many thin[442] words or\r\nvast syllables; and let not many genitive plurals come together.”[443]\r\n\r\nFootnote 441:\r\n\r\n  _Op. cit._, p. 93.\r\n\r\nFootnote 442:\r\n\r\n  _Exilibus._\r\n\r\nFootnote 443:\r\n\r\n  To avoid the _um-um_ sound, the “lowing” to which Quintilian objects,\r\n  and which is undoubtedly one of the great defects of Latin as of\r\n  Anglo-Saxon.\r\n\r\nCautions, it will be observed, sometimes judicious, sometimes\r\ncapricious, but never reasoned.\r\n\r\nThe commentary of Marius Victorinus on Cicero’s _Rhetoric_ is the\r\nlongest of all these treatises. It contains a great deal of [Sidenote:\r\n_Marius Victorinus on Cicero._] matter, and there is no discoverable\r\nreason why it should not have contained a great deal more. For the very\r\nfirst note on Cicero’s words, “I have thought to myself of this often\r\nand very much,” is as follows: “If there be only one of these, it does\r\nnot indicate a sufficiently lengthy cogitation. For we may frequently\r\nthink of a thing, but immediately desist from the thinking. We may also\r\nthink long upon a thing, but do it only on a single day. He therefore\r\nhas properly joined the two, and said: ‘_Often_ and much have I thought\r\nto myself on this.’ And because a thing ought not to be published unless\r\nit be certain and the result of deliberation, he rightly says: ‘I\r\nthought of this _to myself_.’”\r\n\r\nAll this is exceedingly true; but it is also exceedingly trivial. And\r\nthe second is like unto it. _Bonine an mali plus attulerit hominibus et\r\ncivitatibus sc. eloquentia_: “The cause of his deliberation is not\r\nwhether eloquence be good or bad, but whether it have more of good or of\r\nbad in it. The order of the words, however, is not unimportant, for he\r\nmight have said, ‘of bad or of good.’ But Cicero stuck to the nature of\r\neloquence, which, when it first began, did good to men, for it brought\r\nthem together. But later, when it was depraved by the ingenuity of bad\r\nmen, it hurt the republic very much. So he arranged the words in the\r\nproper order in saying _Bonine_, &c. The republic consists of two parts,\r\nprivate and public—that is to say, of men and states. We may notice this\r\nalso in the Verrines, how Cicero always defends either men or cities.”\r\n\r\nA man who is content to write like this need never stop while paper,\r\npen, and ink hold out, or till the kindness of nature, or the impatience\r\nof men, puts an end to his life. Sometimes the comment is not quite so\r\nnugatory, especially when Victorinus illustrates the differences between\r\nCicero and Hermagoras. But he seldom even approaches literary criticism.\r\n\r\nThe rest, save one, may be almost silence. The ambitiously entitled\r\n_Institutiones Oratoriæ_ of Sulpicius Victor is incomplete. [Sidenote:\r\n_Others._] What we have of it follows the usual order of “states”\r\nnarration, &c., with some, but only a few, peculiarities. Most of the\r\nother articles are both meagre and late. Emporius deals with\r\n_ethopœia_, the Commonplace, and one or two other matters. There is a\r\nLatin version of the _Progymnasmata_ of Hermogenes. The probably\r\nspurious _Principia Rhetorices_, attributed to St Augustine, are at\r\nleast commended by his name, yet hardly by anything else; and the same\r\nmay be said in lesser degree of the _Compendium_ of Cassiodorus.[444]\r\nThe verses of Rufinus, on the rhythms suitable to oratory, have more\r\ninterest. And so we may come to Martianus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 444:\r\n\r\n   We shall return to these in the next Book.\r\n\r\nInferior as Latin criticism, on the Rhetorical side, is in comparison\r\nwith Greek, it is not fanciful to say that it ends with a better note,\r\nthough a quaint and fantastic one. The later stages in Greek, as we have\r\nseen, were mere arid technicalities or idle epideictic—ghosts of things\r\nno longer alive, and never perhaps alive with the best kind of life.\r\nWhat followed in the Byzantine age had at best the character of literary\r\nresearch. Such a book as that of Photius, invaluable as it is to us, has\r\nno life-promise in it, either as regards its own generation or for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, there is much of both, as we look back on it, in the\r\neccentric treatise on the _Marriage of Philology and [Sidenote:\r\n_Martianus Capella._] Mercury_, by Martianus Capella.[445] Of the author\r\nand date of the book we know, with accuracy, hardly anything at all. His\r\nfull name appears to have been Martianus Minneius Felix Capella, and he\r\nis described as a Carthaginian. His date is much contested, as well as\r\nhis religion, his occupations, and other things which no mortal need\r\ntrouble himself about; while this date, which _is_ of some importance,\r\ncannot be adjusted very exactly. There is, however, not very much\r\ndispute that it must have been somewhere in the fifth century. “Before\r\n439” is all that his latest editor, Eyssenhardt, will say.\r\n\r\nFootnote 445:\r\n\r\n   Ed. Eyssenhardt. Leipsic, 1866.\r\n\r\nWhat is certain is that the treatise is written in a very late and not a\r\nlittle barbarous Latin style, and that it was popular in the Middle\r\nAges, with that peculiar popularity which seems to have settled itself\r\nupon Boethius, Orosius, and other writers of the last age before\r\nchaos—the age to which those who kept up education in chaos itself would\r\nbe most likely to look back, as connecting them with the greater past\r\nyet not too far off.\r\n\r\nFurther, while we find in Martianus a firm outline of the exact scheme\r\nof Humaner Letters which prevailed from 500 to 1500, we find in his\r\nframe and setting, slightly preposterous and more than slightly\r\nfantastic as it is, just that touch of romance—of youth, with its\r\npromise as well as its foolishness—which is wanting in Byzantine work,\r\nand which has Future in it. On both these characteristics of the whole\r\nbook we must say something, before coming to its rhetorical part.\r\n\r\nThe title of the book (to observe Servian formality) has been already\r\ngiven. Its form is that of the Varronian _satura_, or mingle-mangle of\r\nprose and verse; and it is divided into nine books. The first two of\r\nthese serve as an introduction, containing a wonderful rigmarole, in\r\nmore wonderful jargon,[446] about things in general, divine and human,\r\nthe old mythology and physics, with abstract philosophical\r\npersonifications, _Sophia_, _Phronesis_, and so forth, coming in. At\r\nlast it settles down to the real plan of the treatise, which is that the\r\nSeven Liberal Arts, as adopted (very mainly from this book) by the\r\nMiddle Ages, being estated as bridesmaids (or something like it) to\r\nPhilology, each Art has a book to herself, and, in the flowery fantastic\r\nfashion of the Introduction, gives a summary of her teaching to the\r\nassembled gods. This summary is of the most precise and business-like\r\ncharacter, despite its “trimmings,” so that Grammar is not ashamed to\r\ninform the gods that “Ulcus makes ulc_e_ris, but pecus pec_o_ris,” and\r\nLogic rattles off things like _Primæ formæ primus modus est in quo\r\nconficitur ex duobus universalibus_, and so forth, after a fashion which\r\nsuggests that the marriage itself might have been celebrated by Dean\r\nAldrich with great propriety. The beginnings and ends of the books are\r\ngenerally decorated with verse, and with fancy _prosopopœiæ_ of\r\ndifferent kinds: but the stuff of the text is exactly what it was\r\nintended to be—solid schoolbook matter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 446:\r\n\r\n  There is, however, a certain barbaric charm—of the nose-ring and\r\n  feather belt and head-dress kind—about this furthest development of\r\n  the “African style” which Apuleius had started. The gay bombastic\r\n  ornament of Anglo-Saxon prose-writing, both in Latin and vernacular,\r\n  has sometimes been credited to Martianus.\r\n\r\nThe book devoted to Rhetoric is the fifth, being preceded by those of\r\nGrammar and Logic, in the usual and indeed natural order of the\r\nTrivium:—\r\n\r\n     “_Gram._ loquitur, _Dia._ vera docet, _Rhet._ verba colorat,”\r\n\r\nthough Martianus does not arrange the Quadrivium exactly according to\r\nthe second line of the mnemonic—\r\n\r\n  “_Mus._ canit, _Ar._ numerat, _Geo._ ponderat, _Ast._ colit Astra,”\r\n\r\nhis order being Geometry, or rather Geography, Arithmetic, Astronomy,\r\nMusic.\r\n\r\nThe book on Rhetoric opens literally with a flourish of trumpets,—\r\n\r\n                        “Interea sonuere tubæ,”—\r\n\r\nwhich, as some sixteen rather bombastic hexameters full of _gradus_-tags\r\ninform us, quite alarms the gods, major and minor. In the midst of it\r\nthere steps forth “a stately woman of lofty stature, and confidence\r\ngreater than common, but radiantly handsome, helmed and crowned,\r\nweaponed both for defence and with flashing arms wherewith she could\r\nsmite her enemies with a thundering coruscation. Under her armpits, and\r\nthrown over her shoulder in Latian fashion, was a vest, exhibiting\r\nembroidery of all possible _figures_ in varied hue, while her breast was\r\nbaldricked with gems of the most exquisite colour. As she walked her\r\narms clashed, so that you would have thought the broken levin to\r\nrattle—with explosive handclaps, like the collision of clouds, so that\r\nyou might even believe her capable of wielding the thunderbolts of Jove.\r\nFor she it is who, like a mighty queen of all things, can direct them\r\nwhither she will and call them back whence she chooses, and unbend men\r\nto tears or incite them to rage, and sway the minds of civic crowds as\r\nof warring armies. She brought beneath her sway the senate, the rostra,\r\nthe courts at Rome,” &c., &c., the innocent and transparent allegory of\r\nthe earlier part changing into a half-historical, half-philosophical\r\naccount of the functions of Rhetoric generally. She is followed by a\r\ngreat crowd of men, some Greek, some Roman, among whom (it is worth\r\nmentioning, as a proof of the taste of the age) Æschines, Isocrates, and\r\nLysias are specially mentioned for the one tongue, and, with some\r\nuncertain names, Pliny and Fronto in the other. Cicero is later put, by\r\nRhetoric herself, as beyond competition in either. She displays her\r\ndeclamatory skill in a formal exordium, and then plunges into the usual\r\nmatter of Rhetorical treatises. The treatment is technical, but by no\r\nmeans ill-arranged, clear enough even in the bewildering labyrinths of\r\nthe _status_, not excessive in the Figures, and altogether one of the\r\nbest of the Latin _Rhetorics_. When she finishes, Mercury beckons to her\r\nto join the group of those who had played their part, and to salute the\r\nbride. So she walks with much confidence up to Philology, gives her “a\r\nsounding kiss—for she can do nothing silently even if she would—on the\r\ntop of her head,”[447] and joins the society of her sisters.\r\n\r\nFootnote 447:\r\n\r\n  Martianus is curious in philematology. In the second book of the\r\n  Introduction, when the Muses have described themselves in elaborate\r\n  verse, one of the Graces kisses Philology “on that part of the\r\n  forehead where a smooth middle space intervenes between the pubescence\r\n  of the eye-brows.”\r\n\r\nRecurring to the speech of one of these sisters, Grammar, and combining\r\nit with this, we shall have no ill notion of the helps to literary\r\ncriticism with which the next thousand years of the world’s history were\r\nprovided in the west of Europe. They were rudimentary enough, and those\r\nwho were furnished with them had in most cases no thought—indeed for\r\nlong centuries hardly any opportunity—of using them for any critical\r\npurpose. But they lay ready for the hand of others, and at the\r\nRenaissance, as well as in one brilliant and some minor instances\r\nearlier, they were turned with only a little delay to their proper\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nGrammar, with the quaintness that suffuses the whole book, says, “My\r\nparts are four—_litteræ_, _litteratura_, _litteratus_, _litterate_.\r\n‘Letters’ are what I teach; ‘Literature’ am I who teach them; ‘the man\r\nof letters’ is he whom I shall have taught; ‘_literate_’ the manner in\r\nwhich my pupil shall skilfully handle things.” But the expectation thus\r\nraised is a little falsified, for “letters” are taken at their own foot,\r\nthough Pallas pulls up Grammar and maintains that she has omitted the\r\n“historic part,” which does not mean our historic in the very least, any\r\nmore than _litteratura_ means our Literature.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, both in these places and throughout the book, a great\r\ndeal of “fine confused feeding,” both on matters really literary and on\r\nthose more or less subsidiary to literature, from Phonetics upwards. The\r\ncitations, though not extremely frequent or copious, show pretty wide\r\nreading, especially in Latin. In the book on Rhetoric we find very\r\nparticular and minute attention paid to these considerations of euphony\r\nto which attention has already been drawn, Martianus (who, whether we\r\nallow him poetry or not, was evidently a very careful and deft\r\nversifier[448]) applying his practice in the other harmony with his\r\nusual quaint conceit here. Nowhere, perhaps, do we better perceive,\r\nthough nowhere may we find it more difficult exactly to follow, the\r\nniceties of the ancient ear, than in the caution that while it is well\r\nto end a clause with a molossus (three longs), if the final word is a\r\ntrisyllable you must be careful to put a trochee before it, and by no\r\nmeans a spondee or pyrrhic. Thus “Littus ejectis,” with which Tully\r\nfinishes a clause, is all right, but “rupes ejectis” would be _pessima\r\nclausula_, and “apex ejectis” (where _apex_ is described as a pyrrhic,\r\naccording to its natural quantity in the oblique cases) almost worse.\r\n\r\nFootnote 448:\r\n\r\n  His Anacreontics in particular are sometimes by no means inelegant.\r\n  His use of metrical terms is, however, sometimes odd, and tells tales\r\n  of the inroads and havoc of the accent. Thus below he speaks of a\r\n  molossus with a short first syllable!\r\n\r\nFurther than this, however, Low Latin was not encouraged by its tutor\r\nMartianus to advance. Nor is it surprising that with such teaching we\r\nfind no such advance in the first lisping of the modern literatures\r\nthemselves, till the strangely articulate speech of their greatest\r\ncritic, as he was their greatest creator—Dante the Wingbearer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            INTERCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn considering and summing up the contribution of ancient Latin\r\nliterature to the history and achievements of Criticism, we may\r\nconveniently adopt a threefold division and arrangement, so as to see,\r\nfirst, what was the general character of Latin criticism as contrasted\r\nwith Greek, and with that comparative study of literature which has only\r\nrecently become possible; secondly, its actual and positive achievement;\r\nthirdly, the state in which it left the chances of the future.\r\n\r\nThe first point under the first head is obvious at once, and has been\r\nrepeatedly glanced at and referred to already. The Romans had what the\r\nGreeks had not and could not have—the advantage of literary comparison\r\nin two tongues. This—it may be said a thousand times over, and not be\r\nsaid too often—is an advantage so enormous that nothing else is required\r\nto show the wonderful faculty of the nation which could effect so much\r\nwithout it. Without comparison, not merely is the diagnosis of qualities\r\nmostly guesswork, but even the discovery of them becomes extremely\r\ndifficult. With comparison, the qualities almost “leap to the eyes,” and\r\nthe difference of their results goes far to help in the differentiation\r\nof their natures.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this advantage, huge as it still was, was conditioned\r\nand hampered by the fact that Latin, as a language, was an extremely\r\nclose connection of Greek, and, as a literature, was daughter and pupil\r\nin one. It would be stepping out of the safe and solid, if not often\r\ntrodden, path which has been prescribed for this book, to inquire\r\nwhether, if more scope had been given to the Italian and less to the\r\nItaliote[449] element, this need have been the case; it is sufficient\r\nfor our strictly historical inquiry that it was the case as a matter of\r\nfact. With rare exceptions, of which the Satire itself is a doubtful\r\nchief, with few and more doubtful followers, the Romans invented no form\r\nof literature whatsoever. Nor did they, as more literary races have so\r\noften done, re-create and make their own the forms that they borrowed.\r\nThe earlier lost Roman tragedy was, it is clear, simply _calqué_ upon\r\nGreek, as was the Roman comedy (though the mother-wit of Plautus, one of\r\nthe most original of Latin writers not of the decadence, gives it an\r\noriginal air) absolutely _calqué_ upon the later forms of the Attic. The\r\nEpic was even more slavishly imitative—those who rate Virgil highest\r\nmust admit that, delicately as he walks, and elegant as is his footgear,\r\nhe simply steps in the footprints, now of Homer, now of Apollonius, now,\r\nin all probability, of writers who happen to be lost. The Latin Lyric\r\npoets dare invent no fresh scheme; the historians, even those of genius,\r\nhave the fear, or at any rate the following, of the Greeks always before\r\nthem. And so they deprive themselves, from the critical point of view,\r\nof the very advantage with which they start—they lose their chance of\r\nfinding out the real forms of literature, transcending those of any\r\nparticular tongue, by assimilating the forms of their own as exactly as\r\npossible to another’s.\r\n\r\nFootnote 449:\r\n\r\n  Of course I do not mean to imply that the Italiote cities were the\r\n  direct source of the Greek element in classical Latin literature.\r\n\r\nAnd this lack of independence continues to betray itself throughout, and\r\nat once to lessen their opportunities for criticism, and dilute the\r\nquality of such criticism as they do venture upon. The Roman—it has been\r\nobserved, and truly observed, a thousand times—is a man of letters\r\nalmost always by accident, and on the way to being something else. When\r\nhe is not, he is generally of the second class. Virgil, Horace, and\r\nCicero perhaps are the chief exceptions, and the two first at any rate,\r\nif not the third, were among the most artificial, if also of the most\r\nartful, imitators of the Greeks. To Catullus, his exquisite and hardly\r\nsurpassed poetical faculty was evidently little more than a toy or a\r\npastime—helpful to express his moods of love or of laughter, and that\r\nwas all. So the magnificent singing robes of Lucretius cover a man who\r\nhas hardly a thought of being a poet, who aims mainly at being a\r\nphilosopher; and the scarcely inferior Muse of Juvenal positively turns\r\nher back on her sisters, and busies herself with a sardonic “criticism\r\nof life,” in which indignant disdain is oddly blended with a strange\r\ninterest in all trifles, and all serious things, that are _not_\r\nliterary. The men with whom literature is, if not exactly a passion, a\r\nreally serious interest, are, on the other hand, “polyhistoric” persons\r\nof talent, in strengths varying from Cicero himself to Pliny, or else\r\nmen like Martial, admirable practitioners, and something more, in a\r\nlimited and not very high kind.\r\n\r\nYet, again, though the Roman talent was extremely businesslike, it was\r\nby no means subtle. It could, at any rate to some extent, borrow the\r\nfanciful Greek refinements; but it found a necessity of changing them\r\ninto hard and fast rules.\r\n\r\nTo all this we must add another thing of the first importance. Great as\r\nwere the accidental advantages of oratory in Greece, they were almost\r\ngreater at Rome. During every age of the Republic a good speaker had a\r\ngreat weight in his favour; but in its last age, unless the luck was\r\nstrangely against him, honours and wealth were to be had by him simply\r\nfor the asking. Under the Empire his position as to the honours of the\r\nstate was a little more precarious, and his talents (if he was a very\r\nhonest man and not a very discreet one) were not unlikely to bring him\r\ninto trouble. But if he were not too scrupulous—as in the case of Eprius\r\nMarcellus, of that Regulus whom Pliny evidently admired almost as much\r\nas he loathed him, of Fabricius Veiento, and others—these talents could\r\nbe dishonestly made subservient to fortune. Even in the worst times of\r\nthe worst emperors their exercise in the law courts was fairly safe, and\r\nextremely profitable; while the rage for declamations also gave the art\r\nof speaking a factitious but very great popularity.\r\n\r\nHence there was no fear, or hope, of Oratory being brought to its proper\r\nplace among the departments of literature. On the contrary, the\r\npractical prosaic character of the people tended to exalt it higher than\r\never over such kickshaws as poetry. Probably nine out of ten Romans\r\nwould have agreed with Aper in the _Dialogus_.\r\n\r\nAll this was not particularly favourable to any practice of criticism,\r\nand particularly unfavourable to a fresher and wider interpretation of\r\nit. Yet, as we have seen, there was something of a set towards literary\r\ncriticism of a kind in Rome. There, fashion was at once very powerful\r\nand very conservative: and the fashion of literary conversations,\r\nespecially after dinner, set by the Scipios and others when they came\r\ninto contact on their foreign campaigns with lettered Greeks, seems\r\nnever to have died out till the very incoming of the Dark Ages, if then.\r\nIt may have been—it was—more philological, antiquarian, “folklorish,”\r\nand what not, than strictly literary, but it was sometimes this. The\r\nother fashion of recitation and declamation, closely connected with\r\nthis, provided also material for it. Sometimes, no doubt, these literary\r\nconversations were a terrible bore, as the satirists not obscurely tell\r\nus, and as Pliny, in a letter[450] full of good sense and pleasantness,\r\npoints out to a friend of his who had been bored at another kind of\r\ndinner, where the fun was provided by _scurræ_, _moriones_, and other\r\nprofessional persons not to be mentioned in English.\r\n\r\nFootnote 450:\r\n\r\n  Ep., ix. 17.\r\n\r\nFrom all this we find, and are not surprised to find, that literary\r\ncritical talk, and literary critical writing, in Rome, turned much more\r\nupon oratory than upon any other department, and that, when they did\r\nturn on others, these were often merely or mainly regarded as\r\nstorehouses of quotation and patterns of imitation for the orator. There\r\nwas, indeed, one additional reason for this which has not yet been\r\nmentioned, but which was not unnaturally among the most powerful of all.\r\nOratory was about the only division of literature in which even a very\r\npatriotic Roman could, with any show of reason, consider his countrymen\r\nthe equals of the Greeks. Here the flattering unction was often laid;\r\nand though as regards Cicero and Demosthenes, the inevitably selected\r\nchampions, we may hardly think the match an equal one, it must be\r\nremembered that the extraordinary, and not quite comprehensible, loss of\r\nnearly all other Roman orators puts Latin at a very great disadvantage.\r\nWe have Æschines, Lysias, Isæus, something, if not much, of Hyperides, a\r\ngood deal of Isocrates, on the literary side of oratory. But we have\r\nnothing by which fairly to judge Hortensius or Catulus, Calvus or Pollio\r\nor Messala. What is certain is that men of cool judgment, who did not\r\nventure to set up even Virgil against Homer, and who practically let all\r\nRoman minor poetry go by the board, did think they could make a fight\r\nfor Rome in symbouleutic and dikanic, if not in epideictic, oratory.\r\n\r\nIt follows from all these things that, strong as is the oratorical\r\npreoccupation in Greek, it is stronger still in Roman Rhetoric and\r\ncriticism. Even the men who take the widest view of literature, and are\r\nmost familiar with it—Cicero, Pliny, nay, Quintilian himself—fall, as\r\nhas been said, unconsciously, or in the way of bland assumption as of a\r\nmatter not worth arguing about, into the habit of regarding it either\r\nprimarily as an exercising-ground, a magazine, a source of supply and\r\ntraining for the orator, or as a means of sport and pastime to him in\r\nthe intervals of his more serious business. The utterly preposterous\r\nnotion (as it seems to us) of trying a poet like Virgil by the rules of\r\nthe rhetorician, classifying his speeches, pointing out his deft use of\r\n“means of persuasion,” laying stress on the proprieties and felicities\r\nof his use of language according to the rhetorical laws, taking examples\r\nof Figures from him and the like, could arise from nothing but this\r\npreliminary assumption or confusion, and could only be excused by it. It\r\nis in fact all-pervading—forget or lose sight of it, and there is hardly\r\na Roman utterance about literature which will not be either quite\r\nunmeaning, or very seriously misleading.\r\n\r\nThe consequence is that very seldom do we get literary criticism of\r\nanything like the best kind—of any kind that deserves the name in\r\nmeaning at once full and strict—from a Roman. There is no Latin\r\nLonginus—Quintilian himself is but at best a rather less technical\r\nDionysius of Halicarnassus, and it is even very uncertain whether he\r\ndoes not owe a good deal directly to Dionysius himself. At any rate,\r\nmuch as we owe him, we owe it rather to his ineradicable and inevitable\r\ngood sense, his thorough grasp of the educational values of things, and\r\nhis unfeigned love of literature, than to any full conception on his\r\npart of the art of criticism as an art of appreciation—as a reasoned\r\nvaluing and analysing of the sources of literary charm.\r\n\r\nAnother consequence (of the illustrative kind chiefly) is that the spell\r\nof the Figures is even more heavy on the Roman than on the Greek. That\r\nhorrified cry[451] of the unlucky Albucius, _schemata tollis ex rerum\r\nnatura_, is as much the note of the average Roman critic as the\r\nquotation given above from Simylus[452] is above the note both of Roman\r\nand even of Greek as a rule. It could hardly out of the head of a critic\r\nof this stamp, that if you took the proper number of scruples of\r\nhyperbole, so many drams of antiphrasis, and so on, you would make a\r\nfine sentence—that so many sentences thus formed and arranged, with\r\nproper regard to _inventio_, _narratio_, and the rest, would make a fine\r\nchapter, so many chapters a fine book. The whole process, once more, is\r\ntopsy-turvy, and can come to no good end.\r\n\r\nFootnote 451:\r\n\r\n  _V. supra_, p. 238.\r\n\r\nFootnote 452:\r\n\r\n  _V. supra_, p. 25.\r\n\r\nIn Poetic of the limited kind we have, of course, from Rome one\r\ndocument, the historical importance of which it is impossible to\r\nexaggerate. But the intrinsic importance, even of this, is singularly\r\nout of proportion to its reputation and its influence. As has been\r\nexplained in detail above, it may be unjust to regard the _Epistola ad\r\nPisones_ as a designed and complete tract _De Arte Poetica_. But make as\r\nmuch allowance as we may and can for scheme and purpose, the intrinsic\r\nquality of such criticism as it does give will remain clear and\r\nunaltered. Neither of the real nature, requirements, capabilities of any\r\none literary form, nor of the character of any one source of literary\r\nbeauty, does Horace show himself in the very least degree conscious. His\r\nprecepts are now precepts of excellent commonsense, not less—perhaps\r\nrather more—applicable to life than to literature: now purely arbitrary\r\nrules derived from the practice—sometimes the quite accidental\r\npractice—of great preceding writers.\r\n\r\nYet, all the same, Horace unconsciously and almost indirectly does take\r\nup a very decided critical side, and expresses, with the neatness and in\r\nthe rememberable fashion to be expected from so consummate a master, one\r\nof the two great critical creeds. Nor is there any doubt that this\r\ncreed, so far as literary criticism appealed to the Roman mind at all,\r\nwas that of by far the larger number of persons. This is—not necessarily\r\nin a _ne varietur_ shape, but put very clearly in a certain form—the\r\ncreed of what is known as “Classicism,” the creed which recommends,\r\nfirst of all, as the probable, if not the certain, road to literary\r\nsuccess, adherence to the approved traditions, the elaboration of types\r\nand generalisations rather than indulgence in the eccentric and efforts\r\nto create the individual, the preference of the regular to the vague,\r\n&c., &c.\r\n\r\nThis, it may be repeated without much rashness, was even more the\r\ncritical orthodoxy of Rome than it was the critical orthodoxy of Greece.\r\nWe see it in the stock preference of the Attic to the Asiatic style in\r\noratory; it simply defrays the whole of the just-mentioned criticism of\r\nHorace; it animates the campaign of the satirists against archaic and\r\neuphuist phraseology; it is clearly the proper thing to think in the\r\nliterary miscellanies of Gellius, and even of Macrobius. The precepts of\r\nthe formal treatises, so far as they touch on style at all, never fail\r\nto express this general tendency; and the even more deliberate and\r\ncanonical “correctness” of the modern Latin races and literatures, if\r\nnot directly and unavoidably inherited, is a very legitimate attempt to\r\nrecover and improve the lost heritage of their ancestor.\r\n\r\nNor will any other conclusion, I think, be drawn from the study of those\r\ngrammarians in the strict sense, of whom little or nothing has been said\r\nin the main body of this Book, for the simple reason that there was\r\nlittle or nothing to say. From Varro to Festus the symptoms which we\r\nhave noted elsewhere recur with unmistakable fidelity. The etymology and\r\nsignification of words; the explanation of customs, rites, myths; the\r\narrangements of accidence and syntax—all these things awake evident\r\ninterest, and receive careful and often most intelligent pains. These\r\ngrammarians (and, of course, still more professedly metrical writers\r\nlike Terentianus Maurus) are diligent on metre, and even behind metre,\r\non that most difficult of subjects, in all times and languages, the\r\nmetrical quality and quantity as distinguished from the metrical\r\narrangement of words. But where all these things begin to group and\r\ncrystallise themselves into higher criticism of literary form and charm,\r\nthere our authors, I think it will be found with hardly an exception,\r\nstop dead. I shall be surprised (to stick to the example formerly given)\r\nto have pointed out to me a single passage in which the _poetical_\r\nquality of the Ennian, the Lucretian, and the Virgilian hexameter is\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it would be uncritical not to perceive, and\r\nunhistorical not to note, the existence in the history of Latin\r\nliterature of a current running strongly in the opposite direction,\r\nmaking itself distinctly felt at more than one period, and, finally, in\r\ncreative literature at least, going near to triumph. We have seen, both\r\ndirectly and indirectly, that in the first century of our era there\r\n_was_ a very strong set towards archaism and euphuism, that it had the\r\npatronage of Seneca the father, certainly, if not also that of his more\r\nfamous and more influential son; that it was not by any means wholly\r\ndisapproved by Pliny; and that though what we may call literary\r\northodoxy was against it, a very large bulk (perhaps the great majority)\r\nof the prose declamations and the verse exercises of the time must have\r\nexhibited its influence. What is more, it is certain that in more than\r\none of the Roman colonial or provincial districts, which furnished\r\nfresher and more vigorous blood than the Eternal City herself, or her\r\nItalian precinct, could now supply, this tendency received very strong\r\naccessions from various local peculiarities. It seems to have been least\r\nprevalent in Gaul, though by no means unknown there; the Senecas, and\r\nQuintilian himself, show at what an early date Spanish blood or birth\r\ninclined those who had it to what was long afterwards to take names from\r\nGuevara and Gongora. But the great home of Roman Euphuism was Africa. To\r\nsay nothing of ecclesiastical writers like Tertullian (who might be\r\nsupposed to have their style affected by Eastern influences), Apuleius\r\nearlier, and Martianus later, are more than sufficient, and luckily\r\npretty fully extant, witnesses to the fact.\r\n\r\nYet this tendency is not represented in criticism at all. Apuleius, who\r\nwas a very pretty pleader as well as an accomplished Euphuist in\r\noriginal composition, might well have left us a parallel to De Quincey’s\r\nown vindications of the ornate style, if he had chosen; but it did not\r\napparently occur to him though the _Florida_ would have given a quite\r\nconvenient and proper home to such a dissertation.[453] _Con amore_ as\r\nMartianus describes (in the passage above translated) the gorgeousness\r\nof Rhetoric, it is strictly in reference to her _oratorical_ practice.\r\nIf the satires of the later Cæsars’ time take the other side, and so do\r\ngive us some criticism on that, it is pretty certainly because all the\r\ngreatest satirists, from Aristophanes downwards, have always been\r\nTories, and have selected the absurdities of innovation more gladly than\r\nthose of tradition for their target. Nay, it is a question whether\r\nPetronius, in one direction, and Persius in another, do not, so far as\r\ntheir own compositions are concerned, somewhat incur the blame of which\r\nthey are so lavish, though Martial and Juvenal certainly do not. On all\r\nsides the conviction comes in that for strictly literary criticism the\r\ntime was not ripe, or that the country, the nation, was indisposed and\r\nunprepared for it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 453:\r\n\r\n  The fact that the subject not seldom seems to be coming (_e.g._, at i.\r\n  9 and iv. 20) in this curious patchwork, and does not come, is not\r\n  without significance.\r\n\r\nIn no point, perhaps, is this so noteworthy and so surprising as in\r\nregard to what we may call the literary criticism of metre. For this\r\nLatin offered, at both ends of the history of Latin proper, temptations\r\nand opportunities which, so far as we know, were unknown to the Greeks.\r\nAt the one end there were the remains, scanty, but significant even now,\r\nthen probably abundant, of “Saturnian” prosody. Of this, of course,\r\nRoman writers, technical and other, do take notice: they even, with the\r\nantiquarian and mythological patriotism so common at Rome, take a fairly\r\nlively interest in it. But of the remarkable _literary_ difference\r\nbetween it and the accepted literary metres—a point almost exactly on a\r\npar with that of the difference between our ballad metre and the\r\naccepted literary poetic forms of the eighteenth century—they do not, so\r\nfar as I remember, seem to have taken any notice at all. There must have\r\nbeen—in fact we know perfectly well that there were—Roman literary\r\nantiquaries as diligent, as enthusiastic, and, no doubt, at least as\r\nintelligent as any of our own, from Percy and Hurd to Tyrwhitt and\r\nRitson. There is no reason in the nature of things (indeed, Varro is a\r\nvery fair analogue to the historian of English poetry) why there should\r\nnot have been Romans of the calibre at least of Warton, if not even of\r\nGray. But hardly a vestige of the combined antiquarian, philological,\r\nand literary interest, which animates all these men of ours, appears in\r\nthe extant fragments of any Roman writer.\r\n\r\nThe facts at the other end point to the same conclusion. From no Roman\r\ncritic, so far as I know, have we any notice whatsoever of that\r\ninsurrection or resurrection (whichever word may be preferred) of\r\naccentual against quantitative rhythm which is one of the most\r\ninteresting, and certainly one of the most mysterious, phenomena of the\r\nliterary history of the world. Grant that early in the third century (if\r\nthat be the right date) no cultivated student was likely to pay much\r\nattention to the barbarous rhythms of a Commodian,[454] to be prepared\r\neven to consider\r\n\r\n               “Audite quoniam propheta de illo prædixit”\r\n\r\nas a hexameter. But a hundred and fifty years later things were\r\ndifferent. Before Macrobius wrote, before Servius commented, the verse\r\nof Prudentius had been given to the world. Now, the mere classical\r\nscholar has no doubt been usually unkind to Prudentius,[455] but few\r\npeople who have read him without a fixed idea that anybody who writes in\r\nLatin is bound to confirm to the prosody of the Augustan age, can have\r\nread him without frequent satisfaction. At any rate, he is a literary\r\n_person_; and his personality is emphasised by the fact that at one time\r\nhe tries to write, and not infrequently succeeds in writing, very fair\r\northodox hexameters and trimeters; at others (and in the best work of\r\nthe _Cathemerinon_ and _Peristephanon_) his verse, whether answering to\r\nthe test of the finger or not in metre, is clearly accentual in rhythm,\r\nand seems to be yearning for rhyme to complete and dress it. Now, if\r\nliterary criticism in the full sense had been common, such a phenomenon\r\nmust have attracted attention. The orthodox critics would have attacked\r\nit as furiously as the orthodox critics in England attacked Coleridge’s\r\nsystem of metrical equivalence, or the orthodox critics in France\r\nattacked Victor Hugo’s _enjambements_. The unorthodox critics, the\r\nrevolutionary and romantic party, would, as in each case, have welcomed\r\nit with pæans. But, so far as we know, not the slightest notice was\r\ntaken of Prudentius by the literary wits of the _Saturnalia_, or by any\r\none else.\r\n\r\nFootnote 454:\r\n\r\n  The edition of the _Instructiones_ and the _Carmen Apologeticum_ which\r\n  I use is the most accessible, and I think the most recent, that of E.\r\n  Ludwig (two parts, Leipsic, 1877-78). But I must own that a certain\r\n  compunction invades me at finding any fault with the shortcomings of\r\n  ancient critics, when I find in this edition, at the end of the\r\n  nineteenth century, great care about the text, but not a single word\r\n  about the date, the person, or the circumstances of Commodianus, and\r\n  an utter ignoring of the literary position and interest of the matter\r\n  edited. Commodian’s form may be barbarous, and his matter may be\r\n  respectably ordinary; but he is, at any rate, on a not yet disturbed\r\n  hypothesis, the ancestor—or the earliest example—of the prosody of\r\n  every modern language which combines (as some at least of us hold that\r\n  all modern languages do) quantitative scansion with a partly or wholly\r\n  non-quantitative syllabic value. And one might at least have expected\r\n  a few facts, if not a little discussion, to butter the bread of the\r\n  bare text in such a case. But the fetish of the letter has been too\r\n  much for this editor also.\r\n\r\nFootnote 455:\r\n\r\n  I use the Delphin edition, but I believe the standards are those of\r\n  Obbarius (Tubingen, 1845) or Dressel (Leipsic, 1860). A good deal of\r\n  work which has not yet come in my way seems to have been recently\r\n  spent on this most interesting writer, resulting in such things as the\r\n  first part of a _Lexicon Prudentianum_ (Bermann, Upsala, 1891), a book\r\n  on illustrated MSS. of him (Stettener, Berlin, 1895), while in England\r\n  Mr Bridges has translated some of his charming hymns.\r\n\r\nIn part, no doubt, this silence may be set down to accidental and\r\nextra-literary causes. The very growth of provincial literatures would\r\nat once have rendered the productions of these literatures less likely\r\nto reach Rome, and have disinclined the literary critics of the capital\r\nto listen to provincial productions. Even the debate of Christian and\r\nPagan,[456] as it became more and more of a conflict between triumphant\r\nyouth and declining eld, less and less of the resurrection of a\r\ndesperate and despised minority against established order, may have had\r\nsomething to do with the matter. But, however this may be, the facts are\r\nthe facts.\r\n\r\nWe shall do well to accept them as they are, and to recognise that Latin\r\nhad the criticism which it deserved, the criticism which was made\r\nnecessary by the conditions of its own classical literature, and,\r\nlastly, the criticism which was really most useful both for itself and\r\nfor its posterity—that is to say, in greater or less degree, not merely\r\nthe so-called Romance tongues, but all the literary languages of modern\r\nEurope. The first two points must be tolerably clear to any tolerable\r\nLatinist, but they may be freshly put. A literature like classical\r\nLatin, which is from first to last _in statu pupillari_, which, with\r\nwhatever strength, deftness, elegance, even originality at times,\r\nfollows in the footsteps of another literature, must for the very life\r\nof it have a critical creed of order, discipline, moderation. Otherwise\r\nit runs the risk of being a mere hybrid, even a mere monstrosity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 456:\r\n\r\n  Symmachus, the great defender of Virgil in the _Saturnalia_, was an\r\n  obstinate and audacious champion of Paganism against Christianity: and\r\n  Prudentius wrote directly against him.\r\n\r\nStill more certainly, nothing could have been better for the future of\r\nthe world than the exact legacy which Latin left, not merely in its\r\ngreat examples of literature, but in the forms of the scholastic Grammar\r\nand Rhetoric, to that millennium of reconstruction and recreation which\r\nis called the Middle Age. For that wonderful period—which even yet has\r\nnever been put in its right place in the history of the world—a higher\r\nlesson would have been thrown away, or positively injurious. No\r\ninstruction in Romanticism was wanted by the ages of Romance: for full\r\nliterary knowledge of the ancient literatures they were in no wise\r\nsuited or prepared. Their business was, after a long period of mere\r\nfoundation-work in the elaboration of the modern speeches, to get\r\ntogether the materials of the modern literatures, and to build up the\r\nstructure of these as well as they could. So strongly did they feel the\r\n_nisus_ towards this, that they even travestied into their own likeness\r\nsuch of the old literature as remained.\r\n\r\nBut still Grammar and Rhetoric abode—to be a perpetual grounding and\r\ntutelage, a “fool-guard” and guide-post in these ages of exploration and\r\nchildhood. That the Rhetoric was meagre and arbitrary, that a great deal\r\nof it had nothing to do with literature at all, but was a sort of\r\nfossilised skeleton of a bygone philosophy, or else a mere business\r\ntraining, mattered nothing. The Trivium and Quadrivium, the legacies of\r\nthe classics, especially of Latin, gave in every one of their divisions,\r\nand not least in Rhetoric, precisely the formal stays, the fixed norms\r\nand forms of method, which were required in the general welter.\r\n\r\nHad the appreciative criticism of Latin been stronger and wider, had it\r\nleft any tradition in its own last age, and so been able to throw that\r\ntradition as a bridge over the dark time to come, it would have been no\r\nadvantage, but a loss and a mischief. Not only would it have been waste\r\nof time for the Middle Ages to appreciate Greek and Latin literature\r\ncritically, if they could have done so, but it would have hampered them\r\nin the doing of their own great day’s, or rather night’s, work—their\r\nwork of assimilation, of recuperation, and, not least, of dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK III\r\n\r\n                           MEDIÆVAL CRITICISM\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n\r\n     “_Sola vocabula nobilissima in cribro tuo residere curabis._”\r\n                                           —DANTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                             BEFORE DANTE.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF MEDIÆVAL LITERATURE—ITS ATTITUDE TO\r\n    CRITICISM—IMPORTANCE OF PROSODY—THE EARLY FORMAL RHETORICS:\r\n    BEDE—ISIDORE—ALCUIN (?)—ANOTHER TRACK OF INQUIRY—ST AUGUSTINE A\r\n    PROFESSOR OF RHETORIC—HIS ATTITUDE TO LITERATURE BEFORE AND AFTER\r\n    HIS CONVERSION—ANALYSIS OF THE ‘CONFESSIONS’ FROM THIS POINT OF\r\n    VIEW—A CONCLUSION FROM THIS TO THE GENERAL PATRISTIC VIEW OF\r\n    LITERATURE—SIDONIUS APOLLINARIS—HIS ELABORATE EPITHET-COMPARISON\r\n    AND MINUTE CRITICISMS OF STYLE AND METRE—A DELIBERATE\r\n    CRITIQUE—CASSIODORUS—BOETHIUS—CRITICAL ATTITUDE OF THE FIFTH\r\n    CENTURY—THE SIXTH: FULGENTIUS—THE FULGENTII AND THEIR BOOKS—THE\r\n    ‘SUPER THEBAIDEN’ AND ‘EXPOSITIO VIRGILIANA’—VENANTIUS\r\n    FORTUNATUS—ISIDORE OF SEVILLE AGAIN—BEDE AGAIN—HIS ‘ARS\r\n    METRICA’—THE CENTRAL MIDDLE AGES TO BE MORE RAPIDLY PASSED\r\n    OVER—PROVENÇAL AND LATIN TREATISES—THE ‘DE DICTAMINE\r\n    RHYTHMICO’—JOHN OF GARLANDIA—THE ‘LABYRINTHUS’—CRITICAL REVIEW OF\r\n    POETS CONTAINED IN IT—MINOR RHYTHMICAL TRACTATES—GEOFFREY DE\r\n    VINSAUF: HIS ‘NOVA POETRIA.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may seem a platitude, but it really has much more of the altitudinous\r\nthan of the platitudinous about it, to say that, before entering on the\r\nconsideration of mediæval criticism,[457] it is above all things\r\nnecessary to clear the mind of cant about mediæval literature. For in no\r\ndivision of this work is such a caution a more appropriate writing on\r\nthe door. On the classical [Sidenote: _Characteristics of mediæval\r\nliterature._] and on the modern sections it would be a gratuitous\r\nimpertinence. In both or them, as here, there is the distinction between\r\nlinguistic and literary criticism, and the further distinction between\r\nliterary criticism of different kinds. But in both there are, as there\r\nalways have been in relation to the classics, and as there sometimes\r\nhave been in relation to modern literature, a very large number of\r\npersons who are aware of the _crevasses_, and who can cross them.\r\n\r\nFootnote 457:\r\n\r\n  As at the beginning of Bk. ii. I had less obligation to acknowledge\r\n  than at that of Bk. i., so here also the diminution continues. On the\r\n  general subject it approaches zero. Théry himself is more sketchy than\r\n  himself here; and has practically nothing in detail to say of any one\r\n  save Raymond Lully, who does not supply _us_ with anything, though he\r\n  brought Rhetoric, like other sciences, into his philosophic scheme.\r\n  Even in regard to individuals, it is only on Dante that I know of much\r\n  precedent treatment, and for that _v. infra_.\r\n\r\nIn mediæval literature such persons are, and for the strongest reasons,\r\nmuch more to seek. Until recently—it is the greatest “refusal” and the\r\ngreatest misfortune in the literary history of the world—mediæval\r\nliterature, which some, at least, believe to hold the keys of both\r\nancient and modern, was utterly neglected and contemned. Then, for a\r\ntime, it was praised without full knowledge, or by divination only. It\r\nis now possible to know much if not most of it; but few are they who are\r\ncontent to know it as literature. Not only has it had to go through, all\r\nat once, the usual diseases to which literary childhood is obnoxious,\r\nthe petty grammarianisms which Latin and Greek got over in their own\r\ntime, the squabbles as to interpretation from which the Renaissance, to\r\na great extent, delivered us in their case, and the criticastry of the\r\nseventeenth-eighteenth centuries, but new ailments, diphtherias and\r\ninfluenzas of its own, have arisen in “phonology,” and Heaven knows what\r\nelse. Even this does not exhaust the list of ills that wait upon its\r\nmost unhappy state. It has been thought necessary, for political and\r\necclesiastical reasons, to praise the Middle Ages a little unwisely for\r\na time, and then (more recently) to abuse them with an unwisdom so much\r\ngreater, that one feels inclined to relapse upon the mood of the real Mr\r\nKenelm Digby of _The Broad Stone of Honour_, and the imaginary Mr\r\nChainmail of _Crotchet Castle_. Abused and extolled as “Ages of Faith,”\r\nthey were really ages of a mixture of logical argument and playful\r\nhalf-scepticism. Regarded with scorn as “Ages of Ignorance,” they knew\r\nwhat they did know thoroughly, which is more than can be said of some\r\nothers. Commiserated as Ages of Misery, they were probably the happiest\r\ntimes of the world, putting Arcadia and Fairyland out of sight.\r\nPatronised as Ages of mere preparation, they accomplished things that we\r\nhave toiled after in vain for some five hundred years. They have in the\r\nrarest cases been really understood, even historically. And the\r\nunderstanding which has, in these rare cases, reached their history, has\r\nalmost always merely scrabbled on the doors of their literature. There\r\nare exceptions, of course, some of whom have taught me all I know, and\r\nwhom I honour only short of the great originals. But they are still\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\nLest any one should accuse me of passing from criticism into\r\ndithyrambic, let me acknowledge at once that whatsoever the [Sidenote:\r\n_Its attitude to criticism._] Middle Ages were or were not, they were\r\ncertainly not Ages of Criticism. They could not—it has already been\r\nhinted—have been anything of the kind; it would have ruined their\r\nbusiness and choked their vocation if they had attempted to be so. One\r\nmighty figure does indeed show himself in their midst, to pass on the\r\ntorch from Aristotle and Longinus, through unknowing ages, to Coleridge\r\nand Sainte-Beuve. But their very essence was opposed to criticism in any\r\nprevalence. The incorrigible and triumphant (though or because wholly\r\nunconscious) originality which, in practice, created the Romance,\r\nrevolutionised the Drama, altered History, devised a fresh Lyric, would\r\nhave been constrained and paralysed in the face of theory. At no time\r\ncan we be so thankful for the shortcomings of the School Rhetoric which,\r\nif it had been better, might have done frightful harm. Had the Italian\r\ncritics, with their warpings of Plato and of Aristotle, appeared in the\r\nthirteenth century instead of the sixteenth, it might have been all over\r\nwith us. For the thirteenth century was docile: the sixteenth,\r\nfortunately, was not.\r\n\r\nIn one particular, however, the comparatively scanty criticism of the\r\nthousand years from the sack of Rome by Alaric to the [Sidenote:\r\n_Importance of prosody._] fall of Constantinople before Mahomet,\r\nacquires a new significance. We have hitherto said little about the\r\nformal criticism of prosody, and for good reasons. The Greek, and in a\r\nless degree the Latin, writers on Metric, are interesting, but their\r\ninterest is hardly literary at all, though it has so much to do with\r\nliterature. Before we have any finished classical literature from them,\r\nGreek had by its own _euphuia_ acquired, and Latin had forced on itself\r\nby a stern process of gymnastic, systems of prosody which, though in the\r\nformer case at least easy as nature, were in both cases simply a branch\r\nof mathematics. The decay of Greek, the bursting by the strong Italian\r\nwine of the earthen or leathern vessel of artificial prosody which had\r\nso long contained it, and the rise of the new vernaculars, introduced a\r\nperfectly different situation; and the criticism, the tentative\r\nunscientific rule-of-thumb criticism, of prosody assumed an importance,\r\nat about the beginning of the fifth century of our era, which it has not\r\nlost on the eve of the twentieth. But these general questions will be\r\nfurther treated at the close of this Book (see Interchapter iii.) We\r\nmust now turn to the details of the actual history.\r\n\r\nThe standard collection[458] of Latin Rhetorics contains four of very\r\nearly date, speaking from our present point of view. The [Sidenote: _The\r\nearly formal Rhetorics—Bede._] oldest, and, if it were genuine, the most\r\ninteresting, of all in point of authorship, that attributed to S.\r\nAugustine, we shall—for reasons—take last. The others, still of great\r\ninterest in this respect, are by, or attributed to, the three greatest\r\nmen of “regular” letters in the whole period (500-1000), except Scotus\r\nErigena—to wit, Bede, Isidore of Seville, and Alcuin.\r\n\r\nFootnote 458:\r\n\r\n  Ed. Capperonnier, pp. 318-328; pp. 375-409. Ed. Halm, i. 137-151; ii.\r\n  505-550, 607-618. The _Rhetoric_ (forming part of his _Institutiones_)\r\n  of Cassiodorus is also in both collections. It has been glanced at,\r\n  _supra_ (pp. 346, 349), and will be noticed again, _infra_ (p. 390).\r\n\r\nBede, who has also left us work of interest on metre,[459] has included\r\nin his works a tractate on the Tropes and Figures of the Holy Scriptures\r\nwhich gives us, at least, a glimmer in darkness. His argument is\r\ncharacteristic of his time; but nobody except a churl, and an ignorant\r\nand foolish churl, will smile at it. The Figures are the most important\r\nthings in style; the Scriptures are the most important of books;\r\ntherefore there must be as good Figures in the Scriptures as in any\r\nother book, and better. He uses, to prove his point, seventeen figures\r\nwith examples. In what follows, the chief point of interest is that he\r\nfirst quotes classical examples (chiefly from Virgil) and then\r\nScriptural analogues. But he does not by any means confine himself to\r\nthe chosen seventeen.\r\n\r\nFootnote 459:\r\n\r\n  _V. infra_, p. 403.\r\n\r\nThe critical importance of this, for its time especially, can be shown\r\nwith little labour. The great danger, the great curse, so to say, of\r\nuncritical reading, is the taking of things as a matter of course, and\r\nthe neglect to analyse and ascertain the exact causes and sources of\r\nliterary excellence. Now, in itself, the comparison of the Bible and the\r\nclassics, from the hard-and-fast point of view of a scholastic\r\nclassification of Figures, is a very small matter—and not perhaps even a\r\nvery good matter. But when these two so different things are compared,\r\nfrom any point of view no matter what, the curiosity is aroused; the\r\nmind begins to consider what it really _does_ think fine in this and\r\nthat; and in happy circumstances and cases a real—in any perhaps some\r\napproach to a real—appreciation of the goodness of literature will\r\nresult. Bede did not intend this—he might have left no pepper to any one\r\nwho suggested it to him, as a consequence of his work. But such a\r\nconsequence at least might follow.\r\n\r\nThe references of that great authority of the early Middle Ages, Isidore\r\nof Seville, to Rhetoric are not copious, and are [Sidenote: _Isodore._]\r\nchiefly made up of the already consecrated tags, while the subject is\r\nsomewhat mixed with Logic. The orator is the _vir bonus dicendi\r\nperitus_; the parts of Rhetoric are as usual, its kinds likewise. The\r\nforensic side is almost exclusively prominent, and style has hardly any\r\nattention at all.[460]\r\n\r\nFootnote 460:\r\n\r\n  But see below (p. 400) for other contributions of Isidore to our\r\n  subject.\r\n\r\nVery much more curious is the dialogue with Charlemagne, attributed to\r\nAlcuin or Albinus. The emperor-king, in a [Sidenote: _Alcuin (?)._]\r\nrather precious but not inelegant style, beseeches instruction on the\r\npoint; and his teacher, with grandiosity suitable (at least on the\r\nestimate of Martianus) to the subject, protests that the spark of his\r\nlittle intellect can add nothing to the flame-vomiting light of the\r\nemperor’s genius,[461] but will obey his commands, _juxta auctoritatem\r\nveterum_. In fact, he follows the usual lines, with occasional\r\nindulgence in the curiously, and rather barbarically, but sometimes not\r\nunpleasantly, ornate style which seems to have pleased the youthful\r\nnations of modern Europe. The hard cases of the old Declamations make a\r\nconsiderable appearance—in fact, very much more of the dialogue (which\r\nis neither very long nor very short) is devoted to this side of the\r\nmatter than is the case with Bede and Isidore; and there is even a\r\nslight glance into the subject of Fallacies. The passage on Elocution\r\nmay be scrutinised, not perhaps with very great results, but with some\r\ninterest and profit, not merely because it directly concerns us, but\r\nalso because one may at least hope to have the _auctoritas veterum_\r\nqualified by a little personal and temporal colour. From attention to\r\nstyle comes _venustas_ to the cause, and _dignitas_ to the orator. It\r\nmust be _facunda et aperta_—that is to say, grammatically correct and\r\nclearly arranged. The best authors must be read, and their example\r\nfollowed. In choosing single words (here the characteristic\r\nabove-mentioned may be thought to appear, while the sentiment, and even\r\nthe phrase, though of course not new, leads us interestingly on to the\r\ngreat work of Dante) we ought to choose _electa et illustria_. Metaphor\r\n(_translatio_) brings ornament; as the first object of clothing is to\r\nkeep the cold out, and then we make it ornamental, so, &c. In fact,\r\nmetaphor is now quite common—the very vulgar speak of the vines\r\n“gemming,” the harvest being “luxuriant,” the crops “waving”: for what\r\ncan hardly be described by a “proper” word is illustrated by a metaphor.\r\nMetaphors make things clearer, as “the sea _shivers_”; and sometimes\r\nsave a periphrasis, as “the dart _flies_ from the hand.” But you must be\r\ncareful only to use honest metaphors; and here the old illustrations\r\nrecur. Special figures are slightly touched, though Metonymy and\r\nSynecdoche occur. The remarks on Composition are very meagre, chiefly\r\ndeprecating hiatus, the juxtaposition of similar syllables, &c. It is\r\nnot unnoteworthy that much more time is spent on actual delivery, that\r\nno illustrations from the poets appear, and that the piece finishes with\r\nremarks on religious and moral virtue, of great excellence in\r\nthemselves, but having very little to do with Rhetoric, save indirectly\r\nin the epideictic kind.\r\n\r\nFootnote 461:\r\n\r\n  _Licet flammivomo tuæ sapientiæ lumini scintilla ingenioli mei nil\r\n  addere possit._ This was the kind of style wherewith the Dark Ages\r\n  liked to lighten their darkness.\r\n\r\nBut it is unnecessary to hunt further through the formal Rhetorics which\r\nappeared during the Dark and earlier [Sidenote: _Another track of\r\ninquiry._] Middle Ages, though it may be proper to return to the subject\r\nin the chapter dealing with Criticism after Dante. Conservative in all\r\ntheir ways, though with a conservatism compatible with limitless\r\nexpatiation and rehandling, these Ages were nowhere more conservative\r\nthan in regard to Rhetoric; and Martianus by himself almost represents\r\ntheir manual thereof. The influence of the _Marriage of Philology_,\r\nwhich is prominent at the middle in the _Contention of Phyllis and\r\nFlora_,[462] appears again at the very close, when Hawes “rang to\r\neven-song,” and it will dispense all but specialists from investigation\r\nunder this head. We have seen how small is its contribution to\r\ncriticism. We must therefore look elsewhere, and, throwing back a little\r\nto St Augustine, himself a Professor of Rhetoric, may endeavour to trace\r\nand pick up, often in bypaths, such windfalls of expression about\r\nliterature as may enable us to compose something like a history, if not\r\nof definite and expressed Criticism, at any rate of Literary Taste,\r\ncentury by century, from the fourth to the thirteenth, through a chain\r\nof now almost wholly Christian writers.\r\n\r\nFootnote 462:\r\n\r\n  This very agreeable Latin verse debate on the merits of knights and\r\n  clerks as lovers, which had so long a popularity that it was\r\n  paraphrased by Chapman on the eve of the seventeenth century, dates\r\n  originally, it would seem, from the twelfth. It may be found in\r\n  Wright’s _Poems of Walter Mapes_, p. 258 (London, 1841), or in\r\n  _Carmina Burana_, p. 155 (3rd ed., Breslau, 1894).\r\n\r\nIt is probable, if not certain, that the _Principia Rhetorices_, which\r\nhas been already referred to, and which we have [Sidenote: _St Augustine\r\na Professor of Rhetoric._] under the name of Aurelius Augustinus, was\r\nnever written or delivered by the chief of the Latin Fathers, at Tagaste\r\nor at Carthage, at Milan or at Rome. The loss to him is certainly not\r\ngreat. The treatise, which is short (some ten quarto pages in\r\nCapperonnier), is based upon, and apparently to a large extent quoted or\r\nstolen from, Hermagoras, Cicero’s Rhodian master. It busies itself first\r\nwith the nature of Rhetoric, and the calumnies brought against it, and\r\nproceeds to the examination of technicalities, not dictionary-fashion,\r\nas had lately become usual, but continuously. Perhaps the sole argument\r\n(a worthless one enough, for there were probably ten thousand professors\r\nof Rhetoric doing the same thing in his time) for the Saint’s authorship\r\nis, that no book could better answer to his own bitter description of\r\nhis worldly profession as “selling words to boys.”\r\n\r\nBut he _was_ a Professor of Rhetoric, and therefore, in a way, of\r\nliterature; and the decisive, because in most cases unintentional,\r\nevidence of the _Confessions_[463] touches [Sidenote: _His attitude to\r\nliterature before and after his conversion._] our subject closely and\r\nfrequently. We can not only see what was Augustine’s attitude to\r\nliterature even before his conversion, but from his attitude to it after\r\nthat event we can, without rashness or unfairness, discern the causes\r\nwhich make one huge and important division of late ancient and early\r\nmediæval literature—the works of the Fathers of the Church—almost a\r\nblank for our special purpose.\r\n\r\nFootnote 463:\r\n\r\n  The editions of the _Confessions_, Latin and English, are so numerous\r\n  that I refer to none in particular, but quote book and chapter\r\n  throughout.\r\n\r\nThat Augustine as a little boy (_Conf._, I. 13) hated Greek and loved\r\nLatin, especially the Latin poets,[464] has nothing in [Sidenote:\r\n_Analysis of the_ Confessions _from this point of view_.] it more\r\nmarvellous than that any healthy English boy should hate Latin and love\r\n(it is to be hoped that he still does love) _Robinson Crusoe_, and\r\n_Gulliver_, and the _Morte d’Arthur_, and the _Faerie Queene_. And there\r\nis, no doubt, some allowance to be made for that “megalomania” of\r\nrepentance which besets the strongly religious, in his regrets for the\r\ntears he shed over dead Dido, neglectful of his own death in life as far\r\nas the soul was concerned.[465] But his attitude to literature, as\r\nexpressed in this chapter and onwards, is suggestive not merely of\r\nreligiosity, but of a certain antiquarian priggishness. Will not even\r\nthe “sellers of grammar” confess that nobody knows when Æneas came to\r\nCarthage, while the more learned know that he never did? Which is the\r\nmore useful, reading and writing _per se_, or the figments of poetry?\r\nHomer, though full of “sweetly idle fiction,” was bitter to him, because\r\nhe was difficult. And then he returns to the other line, wherein, it\r\nmust be confessed, he had strong pagan as well as Christian support.\r\n\r\nFootnote 464:\r\n\r\n  For poor little Roman boys had no _prose_ Defoes or Marryats.\r\n\r\nFootnote 465:\r\n\r\n  Virgil was of course popular everywhere. But, as we have seen, he was\r\n  specially popular in Roman Africa, because of the local patriotism\r\n  (the strongest sentiment of ancient times) which laid hold of the\r\n  story of the hapless Queen of Carthage. I have sometimes thought that\r\n  much of the origin of Romance may be traced to this. For Africa, till\r\n  the Mahometan Deluge, was the most literary quarter of the late Roman\r\n  world.\r\n\r\nDo not the poets assign vices to the gods, or rather give the divine\r\ntitle to wicked men? (cap. 16.) Does not Terence actually make one of\r\nhis characters shelter his own sin under Jove’s example? How absurd it\r\nwas, if not worse, to have to learn by heart the wrath of Juno at her\r\nill-success in thwarting Æneas! Nay, he proceeds to further altitudes.\r\nGrammar is more carefully observed than the Law of God. Rhetoric helps\r\nyou to do harm to human beings. His own father spent more money than he\r\ncould afford on sending him to Madaura and Carthage for education, but\r\nwas wholly indifferent to his spiritual welfare (Book II. cap. iii.) His\r\nsuccess in the Rhetoric school (III. 2) filled him with wicked pride. He\r\neven liked stage plays; was so wretchedly mad as to grieve at their\r\nfalsehoods and shadows, and so wicked as to sympathise with the\r\nimaginary but immoral enjoyments of lovers. He read Cicero’s\r\n_Hortensius_ with admiration, but for its wisdom, not its form. His own\r\nprofessorship of Rhetoric was a “covetous selling of tricks to conquer,”\r\nthough he himself would not fee a wizard to gain a dramatic prize. He\r\nwrote a treatise, _De Apto et Proprio_, which we (like him) have not,\r\nbut which was evidently, if criticism at all, criticism in the abstract.\r\nAlthough he refers often (_e.g._, V. 7) to his lectures on literature,\r\nhe gives us hardly a notion of his literary preferences, estimates,\r\nviews; and his Manichæan difficulties, his agonies about the origin of\r\nevil, seem to have drawn him further and further from anything but a\r\nmere professional connection with the subject. In his high eulogium of\r\nVictorinus (VIII. 2) it can hardly be said that he says a word about his\r\nliterature. In all his allusions to his Chair he constantly refers to\r\nthe oratorical, or rather the debating and advocating, not the literary\r\nside. And what to me seems the most conclusive and remarkable point of\r\nall, the long discourse of sinful, or at least worldly, pleasures with\r\nwhich Book Ten closes, contains not a reference to the pleasures of\r\nliterature, which, as we know from the beginning, he did think ungodly.\r\nThey have apparently not importance enough to be taken into\r\nconsideration, not merely in connection with the pleasures of sense\r\n(where there might be a reason for their omission), but along with\r\ncuriosity, love of praise, fear of blame, vainglory, self-conceit, and\r\nother purely intellectual temptations. The boy had been charmed by\r\nVirgil and Terence—wicked charms he acknowledges—but the man, though he\r\ncertainly does not mean to deny their wickedness, has simply put them\r\naway as childish things.\r\n\r\nI have thought it well to be somewhat particular in regard to this\r\nappearance of what we may call the Puritan attitude to [Sidenote: _A\r\nconclusion from this to the general patristic view of literature._]\r\nliterature, in its earliest and perhaps almost its greatest exponent. It\r\nis of course not entirely new—nothing indeed is ever that; and it is not\r\nmerely foreshadowed, but to a certain extent fathered, by the Platonic\r\nviews of poetry, and the Academic and Pyrrhonist views of literature\r\ngenerally. But these older things here acquire an entirely new character\r\nand importance—a character and an importance which can hardly be said to\r\nbe merely matters of history yet. Moreover, as I have hinted above, the\r\nattitude is that—varied only by the personal factor—of all the Fathers,\r\nmore or less, until, and for some time after, the complete downfall of\r\nPaganism, and of the great majority of ecclesiastical writers for a\r\nthousand years later still.\r\n\r\nIts justifications, or at least its excuses, have been often put, and\r\nmust in great measure be allowed. Not merely had it, as has been said, a\r\nmost respectable pedigree in purely Pagan philosophy, but, as a fighting\r\ncreed, it was almost indispensable to the Church Militant. Literature,\r\nand Heathen religion, and the Seven Deadly Sins, were, it might even\r\nseem, inextricably connected. If you wrote an epic you had to begin with\r\nJove or some other false god; if you wrote a parcel of epigrams it was\r\npractically _de rigueur_ to accuse somebody of unnatural vices, or\r\naffect a partiality for them yourself. But even if things had been\r\nbetter—if there had been no danger of relapses in faith, and none of the\r\nworst kind in practice—it was inevitable that the poor Fine Arts should\r\nseem vain and trifling exercises to that intense “otherworldliness”\r\nwhich had come (as no doubt it will at some time or other have to come\r\nagain) as an alternative to secular absorption in things secular. To\r\nAugustine, as to monk and homilist long afterwards, not merely was the\r\ntheology of literature false, and its morals detestable, but it\r\nwas—merely as occupation—frivolous and puerile, a thing unworthy not\r\nonly of a Christian but even of a reasonable being. We shall have to\r\ncount with so much of this in the present book (and not there only) that\r\nit seemed worth while to take note of it at the outset. It probably did\r\nno great harm, for, as has been repeated more than once, what was wanted\r\nwas a new development of literature, as fresh and as spontaneous as\r\npossible: and this might have been more hindered than helped by too\r\ngreat a devotion to the old. Meanwhile the Seven Liberal Arts were not\r\nmuch interfered with, either by the Seven Deadly Sins or by their\r\nopponent Virtues, and the mere necessities of preaching and\r\nhomily-writing, of controversy with heretics, and of historical\r\nsummaries, obliged to practise in the more scholastic branches of\r\nliterature itself. As for the less scholastic, they came soon enough,\r\nand more than well enough, as the rains of heaven descended and the wind\r\nof the Spirit blew—the Northern wind.\r\n\r\nIn such a state of mind literary criticism, though the fact is not even\r\nyet universally recognised, is practically impossible. It is the\r\nfurthest stage, and to some extent the converse, of the famous\r\nfallacy—stated once by a critic[466] of great though one-sided ability,\r\nand probably accepted, tacitly or implicitly, by the majority of critics\r\nstill—that a man “must take pleasure in the thing represented before he\r\ncan take pleasure in the representation.” Here the assumption is that,\r\nif you take pleasure in the representation, you take pleasure in the\r\nthing represented. And there is more also. Not only are the subjects of\r\nliterature in part men or devils masquerading as gods, in part men\r\ncommitting more or less shameful acts; but, even when they are in\r\nthemselves unobjectionable, they are idle fiction, there is no truth or\r\nusefulness in them. Men with immortal souls to be saved or lost should\r\nat the worst be horrified at touching such pitch, at the best be ashamed\r\nof burdening themselves with such trumpery. Great as is St Augustine’s\r\ngenius for producing literature, one doubts whether he had much taste\r\nfor estimating it. The story of the famous pears, which he stole, comes\r\nin rather fatally pat. He stole them, he says, not because he wanted\r\nthem or liked them, but because it was naughty to do it. This, though no\r\nuncommon mood, is the worst possible for the critic. It leads him, in\r\nthe same way, to praise a book or an author, not because he really likes\r\nthem, but because they are naughty—the reverse of the other fallacy and\r\nits punishment.\r\n\r\nFootnote 466:\r\n\r\n  Peacock, in _Gryll Grange_. The utterance is of course dramatic, not\r\n  direct, but the character in whose mouth it is put obviously expresses\r\n  the author’s sentiments.\r\n\r\nTaking this fact into consideration, and adding to it the facts already\r\nglanced at,—the sickness incidental to the moulting of language, the\r\nwant of helpfulness in such ancient critics as were likely to fall in\r\nthe writer’s way, the increasing scarcity, for hundreds of years, of\r\nbooks, and other things of the same kind,—it will be seen to have been\r\nnot nearly but wholly impossible that the Dark and the Early Middle Ages\r\ncould produce much criticism—or any, strictly speaking. The importance\r\nof what they did produce, with the much greater importance of the wholly\r\nnew material they offered (to be long slighted by the critical world),\r\nwill be considered at length in the Interchapter succeeding this Book.\r\nIn the course of the Book itself we shall have to consider a few\r\nrhetorical and art-poetical treatises, entirely in Latin, between the\r\nsixth century and the thirteenth, the solitary document of the _De\r\nvulgari Eloquio_ at the central point of the history, and perhaps some\r\nmore _Rhetorics_ and _Poetics_, now dealing in increasing measure for\r\nmoderns with the modern tongues, between 1300 and 1500. But we shall\r\nderive most of our material, and almost all the more interesting part of\r\nit, from incidental expressions on literary matters in books not\r\nprofessedly rhetorical or critical. And, taking century by century and\r\nbeginning with the Fifth, we are lucky in finding at once, in the latter\r\npart of this, an interesting and half-famous writer who stands at the\r\ngate of the Dark Ages, but is something of a Janus, avowedly looking\r\nback on classical times, and, Christian as he is, admiring classical\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\nThe literary references in the works of Sidonius Apollinaris[467] are\r\npretty numerous, and no small proportion of them possesses [Sidenote:\r\n_Sidonius Apollinaris._] direct or indirect critical bearing. On the\r\nrather numerous occasions when the good count-bishop puts a little thing\r\nof his, in easy or flebile verse, into his letters, he by no means\r\nseldom prefaces or follows it with a little modest depreciation; he has\r\nnot a few references to books and reading, and now and then he\r\ncriticises in form. We could therefore hardly have a fairer chance of\r\nknowing what, at the very eleventh hour and fiftieth minute of the\r\nclassical period, was the general state of literary taste in the West.\r\nThat Sidonius was a very well-read man, not merely for his time, and\r\nthat he had access not merely to most of the things that we have but to\r\nmany that we have not, is sufficiently established by this evidence. And\r\nthat he did not merely read but marked—that he endeavoured to shape a\r\nstyle for himself from his reading—is equally certain. Nor would it be\r\nany argument against his critical competence that this style is, if not\r\nexactly harsh, or even very barbarous, marked by the affectation and\r\ninvolution which seem to beset alike periods of immaturity and periods\r\nof decadence, and which were specially likely to affect a period of both\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nFootnote 467:\r\n\r\n  Ed. Paulus Mohr, Leipsic, 1895.\r\n\r\nBut it is not easy to rank him very high. His critical utterances have a\r\nbesetting tendency to run off into those epithet-tickets which have been\r\nreferred to more than once, and which were the curse of the routine\r\ncriticism of antiquity. Still, he is very interesting both for his\r\nposition and for his intrinsic characteristics: and a selection from the\r\npassages bearing on the subject which I have noted in my reading may, as\r\nin former cases, be of service.\r\n\r\nThe very dedication of the Epistles to Constantius shows him to us as\r\nmodestly endeavouring to follow, if without presumptuous footsteps, “the\r\nroundness of Symmachus, the discipline and maturity of Pliny,” for he\r\nwill not say a word of Cicero, referring only to an odd criticism of\r\nthat master[468] by Julius Titianus, and to an expression of the school\r\nof Fronto, “the ape of the orators,” applied to Titianus himself. The\r\ndescription[469] of the villa at Nîmes which, from Gibbon’s[470]\r\nintroduction of it, is perhaps better known than anything else of\r\nSidonius, includes that of a library containing religious works arranged\r\nin cases among the armchairs of the ladies, and a collection of profane\r\nauthors near the men’s seats. Thus not merely Augustine, Prudentius, and\r\nthe Latin translation of Origen by Rufinus, but Varro and Horace,\r\nreceived attention; while the excellence of Rufinus’ work is brought out\r\nby a critical allusion to the translations by Apuleius of the _Phædo_,\r\nand by Cicero of the _De Corona_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 468:\r\n\r\n  _Quem in stilo epistulari nec Julius Titianus sub nominibus illustrium\r\n  feminarum dignum similitudine expressit._ Ep. i. 1, p. 1, ed. cit.\r\n\r\nFootnote 469:\r\n\r\n  Ep. ii. 9, p. 42.\r\n\r\nFootnote 470:\r\n\r\n  In a note to his account (ch. xxxvi.) of the Emperor Avitus, the\r\n  father-in-law of our poet and epistoler.\r\n\r\nThe metrical questions which were becoming of such immense critical\r\nimportance, in consequence of the impingence of vernacular accent and\r\nrhythm on Latin, are frequently touched upon by Sidonius, not, of\r\ncourse, with a full (that was impossible), but with a fair, sense of\r\ntheir magnitude. He thinks, justly enough (Ep. ii. 10),[471] that\r\n“unless a remnant, at any rate,[472] vindicates the purity of the Latin\r\ntongue from the rust of barbarism, we shall soon have to bewail it as\r\nutterly abolished and made away with.” And then he justifies himself for\r\nwriting a “tumultuous poem” on the church of “Pope”[473] Patiens at\r\nLyons in hendecasyllabics (which he seems oddly to call “trochaic\r\ntriplets” here, as looking at the end only), because he wished not to\r\nvie with the hexameters of the eminent poets Constantius and Secundinus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 471:\r\n\r\n  P. 44 _sq._\r\n\r\nFootnote 472:\r\n\r\n  _Vel paucissimi._\r\n\r\nFootnote 473:\r\n\r\n  Sidonius of course uses _papa_ for “bishop” generally.\r\n\r\nThere is a glance in iii. 3,[474] which may excite indignation in the\r\napostles of the “Celtic Renascence,” at the nobility of [Sidenote: _His\r\nelaborate epithet-comparison_] his correspondent “dropping its Celtic\r\nslough” and “imbuing itself, now with the style of oratory, now with\r\nCamenal measures.” This was his brother-in-law Ecdicius, son of the\r\nEmperor Avitus. The epithets come now in single spies, now in\r\nbattalions. In a very interesting letter (iv. 3), addressed _Claudiano\r\nsuo_ (not, of course, the poet, who was dead before Sidonius was born),\r\nhe says that if the “prerogative of antiquity” does not overwhelm him he\r\nwill refuse, as equals, the gravity of Fronto and the thunder of the\r\nApuleian weight; nay, both the Varros, both the Plinys. Then, after an\r\nequally hyperbolical praise in detail, he addresses Claudian’s work as\r\n“O book, multifariously pollent! O language, not of a thin, but of a\r\nsubtle mind! which neither bombasts itself out with hyperbolical\r\neffusion, nor is thinned to tameness by _tapeinosis_!” And later:—\r\n\r\nFootnote 474:\r\n\r\n  P. 55.\r\n\r\n“Finally, no one in my time has had such a faculty of expressing what he\r\nwished to express. When he[475] launches out against his adversary he\r\nclaims, of right, the _symbola_ of the characters and studies of either\r\ntongue. He feels like Pythagoras, he divides like Socrates, he\r\nexplains[476] like Plato, he is pregnant like Aristotle; he coaxes like\r\nÆschines, and like Demosthenes is wroth; he has the Hortensian bloom of\r\nspring, and the fruitful summer[477] of Cethegus; he is a Curio in\r\nencouragement, and a Fabius in delay; a Crassus in simulation, and in\r\ndissimulation a Cæsar. He ‘suades’ like Cato, _dis_suades like Appius,\r\n_per_suades like Tully. Yea, if we are to bring the holy fathers into\r\ncomparison, he is instructive like Jerome, destructive like Lactantius,\r\nconstructive like Augustine; he soars like Hilary, and abases himself\r\nlike John; reproves like Basil, consoles like Gregory; has the fluency\r\nof Orosius, and the compression of Rufinus; can relate like Eusebius,\r\nimplore like Eucherius; challenges like Paulinus, and like Ambrose\r\nperseveres.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 475:\r\n\r\n  “He” appears to be better than “it,” as partly a personification of\r\n  the book, partly a polite _deflection_ of the flattery from the\r\n  author.\r\n\r\nFootnote 476:\r\n\r\n  Or perhaps “expatiates” is better for “_explicat_” as a contrast to\r\n  _implicat_ for Aristotle.\r\n\r\nFootnote 477:\r\n\r\n  _Vernat ... æstivat_, a favourite antithesis of conceit with Sidonius.\r\n  An alternative equivalent for it would be, of course, the _freshness_\r\n  of spring and the _glow_ of summer. Nor does this exhaust the\r\n  suggested pairs.\r\n\r\nAs for hymns \"your commatic is copious,[478] sweet, lofty, and overtops\r\nall lyrical dithyrambs in poetical pleasantness and historical\r\n[Sidenote: _and minute criticisms of style and metre._] truth. And you\r\nhave this special peculiarity, that while keeping the feet or your\r\nmetres, the syllables of your feet, and the natures of your syllables,\r\nyou can, in a scanty verse, include rich words within its limits, and\r\nthe shortness of a restricted poem does not banish the length of a fully\r\nequipped prose phrase: so easily do you manage, with tiny trochees and\r\ntinier pyrrhics, to surpass, not merely the ternaries of the molossus\r\nand the anapæst, but even the fourfold combination of the epitrite and\r\nthe pæon.\"\r\n\r\nFootnote 478:\r\n\r\n  _Commaticus._ This word, originally employed of the alternate\r\n  _threnos_ of personage and chorus in Tragedy, passed, in rhetorical\r\n  use, to the signification of “short-cut” clauses of prose, and later\r\n  received a special application to poems (especially hymns) in very\r\n  short lines.\r\n\r\nIn this extravagant, but really interesting and important, passage, we\r\nmay probably see the critical taste of the meeting of the fifth and\r\nsixth centuries—of the late classical and the Dark ages, at its best and\r\nmost characteristic. Although the mere taste has lost the power of\r\ndistinction, it retains distinguishing formulas. It has learnt, only too\r\nmuch by heart, certain stock ticket-epithets for distinguished writers,\r\nand it applies them fearlessly and, as far as rote goes, well. Secondly,\r\nwe see that a not unimportant habit of comparison had grown up between\r\nthe old Pagan and the new Christian literature. Thirdly, that Sidonius\r\nwas well aware that all poets of his time by no means kept “the feet of\r\ntheir metres, and the syllables of their feet, and the natures of their\r\nsyllables.” And fourthly, that a lively sense of metrical _quality_—of\r\nthe effects that a poet can get out of metre—existed in him.\r\nFortunately, this sense survived and flourished: and it had almost\r\neverything to do with the formation of the prosody of the new languages.\r\n\r\nThe promise of the twelfth epistle of the same book,[479] which opens\r\nwith a picture of the poet-bishop’s son reading Terence (the _Hecyra_),\r\nwhile his father expounded the parallel passages in Menander’s Ἐπιτρέπων\r\nis not maintained. But the words, _Gaius Tacitus unus ex majoribus\r\ntuis_, opening another letter[480] to a certain Polemius, bring us once\r\nmore close to literary matters, though only to hear that (in a\r\ncharacteristically Sidonian calculus) Polemius might vanquish, not only\r\nTacitus in oratory but Ausonius (another, and perhaps more authentic,\r\nancestor) in verse. If we had a few more details, the letter to Syagrius\r\n(v. 5) on his acquired skill in German speech[481] would be priceless;\r\nas it is, it is rather tantalising. But yet another list[482] of\r\nflattering comparative tickets is valuable because it refers in the main\r\nto lost authors. The diction of Sapaudus is _tam clara tam spectabilis_,\r\nthat “the division of Palæmon,[483] the gravity of Gallio, the\r\ncopiousness of Delphidius, the discipline of Agroecius, the strength of\r\nAlcimus and the tenderness of Adelphius, the rigour of Magnus and the\r\nsweetness of Victorius, are not only not superior but scarcely equal.”\r\nAnd then, with a sort of apology for this hyperbolical catalogue, he\r\ncites the “acrimony” of Quintilian and the “pomp” of Palladius as\r\nperhaps comparable. The sixth and seventh books are, the first wholly,\r\nthe second mainly, occupied with letters to bishops, of whose interest\r\nin literature Sidonius might not be sure, or to whom he might not care\r\nto parade his own. But the eighth[484] opens with one of those\r\nreferences to the nasty critics, the envious rivals and derogators, who\r\nplay the part of Demades to Demosthenes and Antony to Cicero, and of\r\nwhose likes we have perhaps heard from writers later than the Bishop of\r\nClermont. Their “malice is clear while their diction is obscure,” a\r\nplay, of course, on the double meanings of _clarus_ as “clear” and\r\n“illustrious,” and of “obscure” as still observed. And the third letter\r\nof the same has reference to an accompanying translation of the _Life of\r\nApollonius_, not straight from Philostratus, but as Taxius Victorianus\r\ndid it from a recension by one Nicomachus—which the author depreciates\r\nas, by reason of haste, a confused and headlong and “Opic” translation,\r\nthrown out in a rough-and-ready draft.\r\n\r\nFootnote 479:\r\n\r\n  P. 87.\r\n\r\nFootnote 480:\r\n\r\n  P. 89.\r\n\r\nFootnote 481:\r\n\r\n  _Immane narratu est quantum stupeam sermonis te Germanici notitiam\r\n  tanta facilitate rapuisse_, pp. 108, 109.\r\n\r\nFootnote 482:\r\n\r\n  Ep. x. p. 114.\r\n\r\nFootnote 483:\r\n\r\n  No doubt Q. Remmius Palæmon, a very famous, very arrogant, and very\r\n  immoral grammarian and schoolmaster, who flourished from Tiberius to\r\n  Claudius, taught Quintilian, and is mentioned by Juvenal (vi. 451,\r\n  vii. 215-219).\r\n\r\nFootnote 484:\r\n\r\n  P. 172.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh[485] contains a much longer critical passage, of something\r\nthe same character as that quoted and analysed [Sidenote: _A deliberate\r\ncritique._] above. The death of a certain Lampridius gives Sidonius an\r\nopportunity of copying one of the little things above noted, which had\r\nbeen composed in the lifetime of its subject, instead of an elegy, and\r\nof praising the Ciceronian, Virgilian, Horatian, and other\r\naccomplishments of that subject as usual. A prose eulogy follows—a\r\npassage among the best of its author’s for the real feeling and force of\r\nits descant on the _necessitas abjecta nascendi, vivendi misera, dura\r\nmoriendi_, in which we hear approaching the true Mediæval tone. The\r\npraise is by no means unmixed as far as character goes; it only\r\napproaches panegyric when it comes to the literary part. In orations, it\r\nseems, the defunct was “keen, round, well composed and well struck\r\noff,”[486] in poems “tender, good at various metres, and a cunning\r\ncraftsman.” His verses were “very exact but singularly varied both in\r\nfoot and measure,” his hendecasyllables were “smooth and knotless,” his\r\nhexameters “detonating[487] and cothurned (fitted for the buskin)”; his\r\nelegiacs “now echoing, now recurrent, now joined at end and beginning by\r\nanadiplosis” (the “turn of words” in which the decadence bettered Ovid).\r\nIn his “ethica dictio” (probably equal to “ethopoeia”) he did not use\r\nwords as they came, but selected “grand, beautiful, carefully polished”\r\nones.[488] In controversy he was strong and nervous, in satire\r\ncareful[489] and biting, in tragic passions fierce or plaintive, in\r\ncomic urbane and multiform, in his fescennines showing the bloom of\r\nspring (we know this Euphuism) in his words, the warmth of summer in his\r\nwishes; watchful, economical, and “carminabund”[490] in bucolics, and in\r\nGeorgics so rustical as to have nothing clownish about him. His epigrams\r\naimed not at abundance but point; they were not shorter than a distich\r\nor longer than a quatrain; they were not seldom peppered, often honeyed,\r\nalways salt. He followed Horace in swift iambics, weighty choriambics,\r\nsupple Alcaics, inspired Sapphics. In short, into whatever form of\r\nexpression his mind carried him, he was subtle, apt, instructed, most\r\neloquent, a swan like to soar, with wings only inferior to those of\r\nHorace himself and Pindar. And envious fate has left us not a note of\r\nthis swan’s song![491]\r\n\r\nFootnote 485:\r\n\r\n  P. 188 _sq_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 486:\r\n\r\n  _Acer, rotundus, compositus, excussus._ I am never quite certain\r\n  whether these Sidonian collocations (see above, p. 385 _note_) ought\r\n  not to be taken in pairs as antithetic double epithets, “round in the\r\n  keenness, and well struck off in its composition.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 487:\r\n\r\n  _Crepantes._\r\n\r\nFootnote 488:\r\n\r\n  Here does Sidonius (though all unknowing, in the one case certainly,\r\n  in the other all but certainly) repeat Longinus and anticipate Dante—a\r\n  cry of the child in the night.\r\n\r\nFootnote 489:\r\n\r\n  _Sollicitus_, perhaps “actively harassing” his enemy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 490:\r\n\r\n  This is a word so delightful in itself that I have no heart to attempt\r\n  translation. “Carolling,” I suppose, would come nearest.\r\n\r\nFootnote 491:\r\n\r\n  The passage contains many curious details about this not wholly\r\n  Admirable Crichton, who was at last strangled by his slaves. The\r\n  description of the dead body and its silent testimony to the\r\n  crime—_protinus argumento fuere livida cutis, oculi protuberantes, et\r\n  in obruto vultu non minora iræ vestigia quam doloris_—is vivid, and\r\n  does not compare too badly even with the great picture of\r\n  Glouceester’s corpse in _Henry VI._\r\n\r\nWe may close the account of the Sidonian criticism in prose with a mere\r\nreference to the curious list of symbolic gestures and features of the\r\nphilosophers in ix. 9. His poems need not detain us; but reference\r\nshould also be made to the verse enclosure in Epist. ix. 13, containing\r\nglosses on different metres[492] and poetic forms; to the exposition of\r\n“recurrent” verses in the succeeding letter, as well as, in the\r\n_Carmina_, to the long list, with critical remarks, of authors in ix.;\r\nto the very interesting, and to this day sound, justification of the\r\nintroduction of exotic words and neologisms when necessary, in the prose\r\npreface to xiv.; and to a crowd of literary references in xxiii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 492:\r\n\r\n  P. 223.\r\n\r\nI have been somewhat copious in dwelling on the bishop-count-poet,\r\nbecause he is infinitely the most valuable document [Sidenote:\r\n_Cassiodorus._] that we have as to the highwater-mark of the state of\r\ncritical knowledge and opinion with which the Dark or Earlier Middle\r\nAges started.[493] We have in the last book examined the chief text-book\r\nof formal grammar and Rhetoric, that of Martianus, with which they were\r\nalready provided, and we need only glance at two other standards of\r\ntheirs, Boethius and Cassiodorus, who come close in time to Sidonius,\r\nand probably to Martianus likewise. Cassiodorus wrote, like Capella, on\r\nthe Liberal arts, though in a manner at once informal and less\r\nfantastic, and his influence in encouraging the frequenters of the\r\nmediæval _scriptorium_ to copy ancient manuscripts deserves eternal\r\ngratitude. But I have not yet discovered in him much material for our\r\nspecial inquiry.\r\n\r\nFootnote 493:\r\n\r\n  Indeed, such a passage as the elaborate criticism of the literary work\r\n  of Lampridius, however exaggerated and out of focus, is of quite\r\n  priceless value to us. It is the kind of thing of which we have only\r\n  too little from classical antiquity, and if it were not for the\r\n  Halicarnassian and Longinus, should have quite wofully little. It is\r\n  the kind of thing of which we have as nearly as possible nothing from\r\n  the Middle Ages, and hardly anything, of equal directness to the\r\n  individual, from the Renaissance; while, though it has been plentiful\r\n  enough for the last two hundred and fifty years, and especially for\r\n  the last hundred, the very abundance of it diminishes the individual\r\n  significance of the expressions.\r\n\r\nNor is the great name of Boethius here as great as elsewhere. He wrote,\r\nindeed, on rhetorical _loci_, and the author of the [Sidenote:\r\n_Boethius._] metres in the _Consolatio_[494] deserves no mean place in\r\ncreative literature. But if he had taken any really keen critical\r\ninterest in books, for their form as distinguished from their matter, it\r\nmust have appeared in the _Consolatio_ itself. On the contrary, as\r\neverybody knows who has ever looked at the book, it begins with\r\nPhilosophy packing the Muses off as “strumpets and mermaidens” in a tone\r\nhalf-suggestive of Plato a little the worse for Augustine. And though\r\nthe “suasion of sweetness rhetorien” is afterwards patronisingly spoken\r\nof (Book II., Prose i.), and Homer with the honey-mouth, Lucan, and\r\nothers are quoted, yet Rhetoric is expressly warned that “she goeth the\r\nright way only when she forsaketh not _my_ statutes.” Moreover, the\r\nbeautiful metre _Vela Neritii ducis_ is a merely moral, and almost\r\nmerely allegorical, playing on the story of Circe.\r\n\r\nFootnote 494:\r\n\r\n  I use the agreeable Variorum edition, Leyden, 1671. No apology, I\r\n  think, is needed in this instance for not making my own translations,\r\n  but partly conveying Chaucer’s.\r\n\r\nWe can, however, see from the comparison some useful things. The stock\r\nof actual erudition possessed by at any rate some persons was\r\nconsiderable; but the number of these persons was not very large, and\r\nboth the [Sidenote: _Critical attitude of the fifth century._] “remnant”\r\nitself[495] and its accomplishments were likely to decline and dwindle.\r\nThe new vernaculars were already assuming importance; men were\r\nlikely[496] to be chosen for positions of ecclesiastical eminence\r\n(almost the only ones in which study of literature was becoming\r\npossible), because of their bilingual skill, or to be driven by such\r\npositions to study of the vernacular. And this bilingualism was likely\r\nnot merely to barbarise even their Latin style, but to draw them away\r\nfrom the study of classical Latin, and still more Greek. In regard to\r\nthe latter, we see further, from two passages of Sidonius quoted above,\r\nthat persons of very considerable education were apt to use translations\r\nof the Greek fathers, as well as of Pagan writings, in preference to the\r\noriginal. Yet again we see that even the most accomplished scholars of\r\nthe time (and Sidonius himself may certainly claim that distinction)\r\nwere, on the one hand, more and more acquiescing in what, to borrow\r\nCovenanting phraseology, we may call the “benumbing, deadening, and\r\nsoul-destroying” list of ticket-epithets: and, on the other, were\r\ngradually losing a sense of the relative proportions of things—of the\r\nliterary ratio of patristic to classical literature, and of the\r\nproductions of their own day to those of the great masters, whether\r\nclassical or patristic. And thirdly, we see that even so careful a\r\nmetrical student as the Bishop of Clermont was succumbing to the charm\r\nof “recurrent” verses, acrostics, telestics, and all the rest of it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 495:\r\n\r\n  _V. supra_, p. 384, and note.\r\n\r\nFootnote 496:\r\n\r\n  As in the well-known cases, somewhat later, of St Faron and of\r\n  Mummolenus.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this process of “losing grip” is very far from the\r\nstate in which we find it by the time that we are in full Middle Age:\r\nand, for good as well as for evil, the glorious hotch-potch of that\r\nperiod is still distant. Virgil is not yet an enchanter or anything like\r\nit: he and his works are perfectly well placed in their proper literary\r\nand historical connections. If, on the side of form, there is perhaps\r\nalready a rather perilous tendency to see no very great difference\r\nbetween Orosius and Livy, there is none to put Dares (who probably did\r\nnot exist) on a level as an authority with Homer, or above him, in point\r\nof matter. And while the fables about Alexander probably _did_ exist,\r\nmen of education did not think of mixing them up with the facts.\r\n\r\nThe most favourable sign of all, however, is that metrical solicitude\r\nwhich has been already more than once referred to. The anxiety which\r\nSidonius shows to suit his metres to his subject would do credit to a\r\nmuch better poet in a much more “enlightened” age; and it is surely not\r\nfantastic to see in his constant reference to success or failure in\r\nadjusting “syllables to feet, and feet to measures,” that the difference\r\nof the classical prosody from the newer, half-accentual quantification\r\neven in Latin, and from the vernacular rhythms sounding all over Europe,\r\nwas forcing itself, consciously or unconsciously, on his mind. And it\r\ncannot be repeated too often that to construct and perfect new\r\nprosodies, in Latin and in the vernaculars alike, was perhaps the\r\ngreatest critical-practical problem that the Middle Age had before it.\r\n\r\nThe sixth century has even fewer lights among its gathering gloom; in\r\nthe beginning and at the end of the seventh a kind of rally of torches\r\nis made by Isidore and Bede. [Sidenote: _The sixth—Fulgentius._] There\r\nare, however, two authors at least in the sixth who are full of\r\nsignificance, even if that significance be too much of a negative kind.\r\nThese are the African grammarian Fulgentius, with his _Expositio\r\nVirgiliana_, probably in the earlier half, and the poet-priest Venantius\r\nFortunatus, certainly in the later.\r\n\r\nFulgentius[497] holds something like a position in the history of\r\nAllegory, being not infrequently breveted with the rank of go-between,\r\nor the place of fresh starting-point, between the last development of\r\nthe purely classical allegory in Claudian, and the thick-coming\r\nallegoric fancies of the early Christian homilists and commentators,\r\nwhich were to thicken ever and spread till the full blossoming of\r\nAllegory in the _Romance of the Rose_, and its busy decadence\r\nthenceforward. Unluckily, Allegory was, as we have seen, no novelty in\r\ncriticism; but rather a congenital or endemic disease—and Fulgentius\r\nonly marks a fresh and furious outburst of it. Virgil, a favourite\r\neverywhere in the late Roman world, was, it has been said, an especial\r\nfavourite in Africa: and Fulgentius would appear to have given the\r\nreins, not exactly to the steed, but to the ass, of his fancy, in\r\nreference to the Mantuan.\r\n\r\nFootnote 497:\r\n\r\n  Fabius Planciades Fulgentius (to describe whom in appropriate epithet\r\n  would require the pen and ink of Ritson, though his recent editor says\r\n  that the _injucundum opus_, as Reifferscheid had called it, had become\r\n  to him _jucundissimum_ in performance) used to be buried in the\r\n  _Mythographi Latini_. The benevolence of Herr Teubner has however made\r\n  him accessible separately, or rather with a dim little brace of\r\n  satellite Fulgentii (ed. Helm, Leipsic, 1898).\r\n\r\nThe writings of the Fulgentian clan (none of which, fortunately, is\r\nlong) consist of (1) three books of _Mitologiæ_ (_Mythologiæ_), of (2)\r\nthe _Expositio Virgilianæ Continentiæ [Sidenote: _The Fulgentii and\r\ntheir books._] secundum Philosophos Morales_ which is our principal\r\ntext, and of (3) a shorter _Expositio Sermonum Antiquorum_, attributed\r\nto Fabius Planciades Fulgentius, who was probably of African birth, and\r\nprobably lived in the early sixth century; of (4) a tractate, _De\r\nÆtatibus Mundi et Hominis_, attributed to Fabius Claudius Gordianus\r\nFulgentius; and (5) of a note on the _Thebaid_ of Statius, attributed to\r\nFulgentius, Saint and Bishop. The personalities of these persons are to\r\nthe last degree unknown; and it is very uncertain whether they were in\r\nreality one or two or three. The books we may best cite as 1, 2, 3, 4,\r\n5.\r\n\r\n4 is far better written and more sensible than the others; but it has\r\nnothing to do with our subject. 3 is a short list (sixteen pages and\r\nsixty-two articles) of notes on out-of-the-way words (_abstrusi\r\nsermones_), where it is curious to find among really unusual\r\nlocutions—_friguttire_, _suggrundaria_, _tittivilitium_, and the\r\nlike—such to us everyday ones as _problema_ and _auctio_. 2 and 5\r\nconcern our business, equally in substance, unequally in importance and\r\nextent, and to understand them both, it is desirable to read 1 at least\r\ncursorily, although it, like them, is a tissue of appallingly barbarous\r\nLatin—enshrining allegorical interpretations as ridiculous as the most\r\nabsurd in the _Gesta Romanorum_,[498] and derivations which in their\r\nsheer serious insanity surpass the most promising efforts of the clever\r\nand sportive schoolboy in the same kind. As no one, I think, who reads\r\nthis book will regard me as a detractor of the Dark and Middle Ages, I\r\nmay speak here without fear and without favour.\r\n\r\nFootnote 498:\r\n\r\n  Some of the morals of the _Gesta_ are of course not in the least\r\n  ridiculous: but others “bear the bell” in that respect.\r\n\r\nHaving surveyed Mythology from the point of view of the most grovelling\r\nallegory, etymologically assisted by such fancies as that Teiresias\r\n(T_e_resias in his spelling) is derived [Sidenote: _The_ Super Thebaiden\r\n_and_ Expositio Virgiliana.] from _theros_ and _æon_, meaning “eternal\r\nsummer,” and that Ulixes _Græce_ (it will go near to be thought shortly\r\nthat Fulgentius knew less Greek than Shakespeare) is “quasi-_olon xenos_\r\nid est omnium peregrinus,” Fulgentius seems to have turned to\r\nliterature. If he also wrote the note on the _Thebaid_ attributed to the\r\nSainted Bishop (and it is very much in the same style), he confined\r\nhimself to a brief argument of the story, with a few etymologies, such\r\nas “_Creon quasi cremens omnia_,” and a short preface. In this he tells\r\nus that he “can never without grand ammiration[499] retract the\r\nininvestigable prudence of the poets, and the immarcescible vein of\r\ntheir genius”: and having thus prepared rejoicing for the heart of the\r\nLimousin scholar nine hundred years ahead, he sets the fashion to Lyly\r\nby observing “Diligit puer nucem ad ludum integram: sapiens autem et\r\nadultus frangit ad gustum.” But this, though not insignificant, is a\r\nslight thing.\r\n\r\nFootnote 499:\r\n\r\n  The forms _ammiratio_, _nimfa_, &c. are interesting as showing Latin\r\n  in its transformation to Romance.\r\n\r\nThe _Expositio Virgiliana_ or _Virgiliana Continentia_ (this word being\r\nlate Latin for “contents”) is itself not long: it fills, with _apparatus\r\ncriticus_, some five-and-twenty pages. If it were not written in a most\r\ndetestable style, combining the presence of more than the affectation\r\nand barbarism of Martianus with a complete absence of his quaintness and\r\nfull-blooded savour, it would be rather agreeable to read: even as it\r\nis, it is full of interest. We catch Virgil in mid-flight through the\r\nvoid, from that position of universal exponent of sober literary art\r\nwhich we have seen him occupy with Macrobius, to his rank as beneficent\r\nenchanter a few centuries later. The Bucolics and Georgics are full of\r\nsuch _Phisica secreta_, such _misticæ rationes_, that they are actually\r\ndangerous to touch. He has passed over the _interna viscera nullius pæne\r\nartis_ in these books. In the first Eclogue he has physically summed up\r\nthe three lives (active, contemplative, and enjoying); in the fourth, he\r\nis a prophet; in the fifth, a priest; in the sixth, partly a musician,\r\npartly a physiologist; in the seventh, _botanicen dinamin tetigit_, he\r\nhas touched the power of botany;[500] in the eighth he has pointed out\r\nmagic and the apotelesmatic of the musician; combining this with\r\n_euphemesis_,[501] in the ninth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 500:\r\n\r\n  It is very agreeable to see how the poor copyist of one MS., utterly\r\n  nonplussed by the learning of Fulgentius, has excogitated the blessed\r\n  words “totakicendi namin.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 501:\r\n\r\n  This, disentangled from various _voces nihili_ in the MS., is probably\r\n  used in one of the senses which εὐφημία more properly bears in\r\n  classical Greek, “liturgical writing,” “prayer and praise.”\r\n\r\nIn the first Georgic he is throughout an astrologer and then a\r\n“eufemetic”; in the second, a physiologist and medical man; in the\r\nthird, wholly an aruspex; and in the fourth, is to the fullest musical.\r\nBut Fulgentius will not meddle further with the details of these books;\r\nand, after a breathless and intricate prologue, attacks the _Æneid_ in a\r\nmanner easily to be conjectured from what has been said. Every word,\r\nevery syllable almost, of the first line, is tortured to yield an\r\nallegory; the account being thrown into the form, first of a dialogue\r\nbetween poet and interpreter, and then of a long speech from the former.\r\nAchates is “Græce quasi _aconetos_ id est tristitiæ consuetudo.” Iopas\r\nis “quasi _siopas_ id est taciturnitas puerilis.” The progress of the\r\nstory is the growth of human life. The wanderings of the first three\r\nbooks are the tales that amuse youth; the fourth shows how love\r\ndistracts early manhood; the fifth displays it turning to generous\r\nexercises; the sixth is deep study of nature and things; the rest active\r\nlife. And if anybody wishes to know why Turnus’ charioteer was called\r\nMetiscus, “Metiscos enim Græce est ebriosus.”\r\n\r\nIt cannot be necessary to say much of this, which speaks for itself; it\r\nis, as we said at first, the _intellectus_ (or rather the want of\r\nintellect) _sibi permissus_ and expatiating unchecked. _Qui l’aime le\r\nsuive!_\r\n\r\nVenantius Honorius Clementianus Fortunatus[502] (for a plethora of names\r\nwas as characteristic of the Latin as of other decadences) is a much\r\nmore interesting figure, and his [Sidenote: _Venantius Fortunatus._]\r\ncritical importance, if less direct, is not really inferior. He goes in\r\nthe general literary memory with Sidonius, as the twin-light of not yet\r\nwholly barbaric Gaul; and he had probably more original poetic gift than\r\nhis predecessor. At least, I can find nowhere in Sidonius anything\r\napproaching the throb and thrill of his two great and universally known\r\nhymns, _Pange Lingua_ and _Vexilla Regis_—the earliest, perhaps, to\r\nattain that ineffable word-music of hymn-Latin, which is entirely\r\nindependent of mere tune, mere setting, and which is not only equal to,\r\nbut independent of, the choicest sound-music of either ancient or modern\r\nverse. He was also a livelier writer; and though he has made even\r\nfurther progress in the direction of affectation and bombast, these\r\nthings rather add a piquancy, if not to his painful official praises of\r\nQueen Brunehault, at any rate to his expression of his half-pious,\r\nhalf-human affection for Radegund the Queen and Agnes the Abbess, his\r\naccount of the sad results when the hospitable Mummolenus[503] would\r\nmake him eat too many peaches, and his admirable description of his sail\r\non the Moselle.\r\n\r\nFootnote 502:\r\n\r\n  Ed. in two parts—the prose by F. Leo and the verse by B. Krusch—among\r\n  the _Monumenta Germaniæ Historica_ (Berlin, 1881-85).\r\n\r\nFootnote 503:\r\n\r\n  Not the Bishop afterwards famous as first known to preach in French.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he was certainly accomplished in all the learning of his time.\r\nHe could even write very fair, if not delightful, sapphics. And he is\r\nnot to be treated with the scornful contempt which some have heaped upon\r\nhim, merely because he composed (with an amount of labour which makes\r\none’s brain and eyes ache to think of) acrostics and cross-poems of\r\nvarious degrees of artificiality. He has one marvellous structure of the\r\nlatter kind,[504] in which not only do the frame-letters of the scheme\r\nmake sense, but correspondences, interwoven in the text trace out, also\r\nin sense, a sort of cross _patée_, as thus:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHere the dots represent (though they are fewer) letters doing double\r\nduty, as part of sentences straight across, and in the lines of the\r\nfigure itself. “The grace and liberty of the composition,” as some one\r\nsays, may indeed be lost in such intricacies, yet are they not in\r\nthemselves unliterary as a pastime.\r\n\r\nFootnote 504:\r\n\r\n  Part i. p. 30. Another design of only minor intricacy, but not fully\r\n  filled in, appears a little later.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be most frankly confessed that the literary\r\nexpressions and references which we find in Fortunatus are (in the sense\r\nin which the word has so often to be used in this part of our work)\r\n“tell-tales.”\r\n\r\nThe Preface of his Poems,[505] addressed to Pope Gregory, opens with a\r\nsomewhat emphatic and inflated laudation of the great men of letters of\r\nold, who were, we learn, \"provident in invention, serious in partition,\r\nbalanced in distribution, pleasant with the heel of epilogues, fluent\r\nwith the fount of bile, beautiful with succise terseness, adorned from\r\nhead to foot [literally \"alike crowned and buskined\"] with tropes,\r\nparadigms, periods, epicheiremes,\" which gives us a pretty clear idea of\r\nwhat seemed to Fortunatus to be literature. It contains also some\r\ntouches of the “Italic”[506] writer’s contempt of those who “make no\r\ndistinction between the shriek of the goose and the song of the swan,”\r\nwho love “the harp buzzing barbarous _leods_.” But far fewer direct\r\nreferences to literature occur in these poems than in those of Sidonius.\r\nIn II. ix.,[507] to the Parisian clergy who bade him resume his\r\nlong-abandoned lyre, he takes it up purely as the hymn-writer, not the\r\nman of letters. There is more of the attitude of the latter in the prose\r\nepistle (III. iv.)[508] to Bishop Felix, but it does not come to very\r\nmuch. In the tenth of the same book,[509] the same bishop (who had, it\r\nseems, turned a river from its course) receives a complimentary\r\nreference to Homer, but none to Herodotus. Yet another bishop (of the\r\nundeniably Frankish name of Bertechramnus) is complimented, in the\r\neighteenth, on his epigrams.[510] But Fortunatus, after much applause,\r\ndoes not fear (let us hope that the Frank was more placable than his\r\nbrother prelate of Granada later) to add—\r\n\r\n             “Sed tamen in vestro quædam sermone notavi\r\n               Carmine de veteri furta novella loqui,\r\n             Ex quibus in paucis superedita syllaba fregit\r\n               Et pede læsa suo musica clauda gemit.”\r\n\r\nLet us congratulate Venantius on not yielding to the heresy of the\r\n“extra-metrical syllable,” which has deceived some of the very elect in\r\nmore illuminated days. Some slight glimmers are given by the\r\nflattery,[511] more elaborate than anything yet noticed, of still\r\nanother bishop, Martin of Gallicia: and in V. iii.[512] we get a\r\nticket-list of the same kind (though shorter and slighter) as those of\r\nwhich Sidonius is so prodigal. In this, after Athanasius has been\r\ndesignated _fortis_, Hilary _clarus_, Martin _dives_, and Ambrose\r\n_gravis_, he adds the distich—\r\n\r\n            “Gregorius _radiat_, sacer Augustinus _inundat_,\r\n              Basilius _rutilat_, Cæsariusque _micat_.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 505:\r\n\r\n  Part i. p. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 506:\r\n\r\n  Fortunatus seems to have been carefully styled Presbyter _Italicus_.\r\n  Cf. “Romanos” below. He was born at, or near, Treviso.\r\n\r\nFootnote 507:\r\n\r\n  P. 37.\r\n\r\nFootnote 508:\r\n\r\n  P. 52.\r\n\r\nFootnote 509:\r\n\r\n  P. 62.\r\n\r\nFootnote 510:\r\n\r\n  P. 72.\r\n\r\nFootnote 511:\r\n\r\n  In the prose overture of Bk. V., p. 101 _sq._\r\n\r\nFootnote 512:\r\n\r\n  Ll. 37-40 (p. 107).\r\n\r\nThe epistle to Syagrius of Autun (V. vi.)[513], which introduces another\r\nelaborate cross-poem, contains a vindication of it, by a twist of the\r\nHoratian tag to the effect that as painting and poetics are so like, why\r\nshould you not combine them in such a fashion? After which the\r\nintricacies of the poem itself are carefully explained. The reference to\r\n“us Romans” in the poem to Sigebert (V. ii. 98)[514] (where he\r\ncompliments the king on his skill, Sicambrian as he is, in the Latin\r\ntongue) suggests that the writer would have been scantly grateful for\r\nthe inclusion of his work among “Monumenta _Germaniæ_.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 513:\r\n\r\n  P. 112.\r\n\r\nFootnote 514:\r\n\r\n  P. 133.\r\n\r\nThe genuine prose works of Fortunatus, consisting only of a few Saints’\r\nLives, do not promise much; but there is at least one remarkable passage\r\nin them. It is the opening of the Life of Saint Marcellus[515] in which\r\nhis customary deprecation takes this form. “Illustrious orators of the\r\nmost eloquent genius, whose speeches are distinguished by varied\r\nflowers, and shadowed by the vernal tendrils of eloquence, are wont\r\ndeliberately to seek common causes and sterile matter, that they may\r\nshow themselves as possessing an inexhaustible flow of speech on the\r\nsmallest subjects, and as able to inundate the dryest themes with their\r\ninternal founts of rhetoric. Men not so clever cannot even treat great\r\nsubjects,” &c.\r\n\r\nFootnote 515:\r\n\r\n  Part ii. p. 49.\r\n\r\nAnd this, falling in with the other glimpses we have obtained, gives no\r\nmisty view of the critical standpoint of this agreeable writer. The\r\nliterary _nisus_, the literary tone, are fairly well maintained; there\r\nis no glaring lack of positive knowledge; and neither style nor sense\r\nshows anything like the degradation of Fulgentius. But Fortunatus, far\r\nmore than Sidonius, is, in the good old phrase, “to seek” in the general\r\nfield of matters literary, and especially in its critical quarters.\r\nGlitter and clatter, tinsel and crackers, are in prose, if not in verse\r\n(he is far more sober there), too much his ideals. The curse of the\r\nancient formal Rhetoric has so far outlasted its blessings, that the\r\nexpression of opinion last quoted would suit, and almost exaggerate, the\r\nposition of the worst of the old declamation-makers. As to prosody, he\r\nhas to some extent, if not wholly, “kept the bird in his bosom,” and his\r\naffection for subtleties in arrangement is, as has been said, not so\r\nwholly to his discredit as Mr Addison and Mr Pope thought. But it is\r\nrather a dangerous support; and he has very few others.\r\n\r\nAs Fulgentius and Venantius have stood for the sixth, so Isidore and\r\nBede[516] may stand for the seventh century, while Bede’s flourishing\r\ntime stretches into the eighth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 516:\r\n\r\n  Aldhelm, between the two, wrote on metre, and is a considerable and\r\n  characteristic writer for his time, but needs no detailed treatment\r\n  here.\r\n\r\nIsidore’s treatment of Grammar[517] is much fuller than his handling of\r\nher showier sister Rhetoric.[518] It fills the whole of [Sidenote:\r\n_Isidore of Seville again_.] the First Book of the curious Encyclopædia\r\ncalled the _Origines_, and is much more liberally arranged than the\r\nusual grammatical treatise, including a great deal of applied matter of\r\nvarious kinds, visibly filching Tropes and Figures from Rhetoric\r\nherself, and, besides dealing with Prosody, even devoting sections to\r\nthe Fable and to History under more than one head. There is much\r\ninteresting (if not for us strictly relevant) matter in the earlier\r\nchapters, where we read that _literæ_ are _quasi legiteræ_, and that\r\nGreek and Latin appear to have arisen out of Hebrew. The _vitia_, from\r\nbarbarism and solœcism downwards, are pure Rhetoric, containing, as\r\nthey do, things like _tapeinosis_ and amphibology, with which Grammar,\r\nas such, has certainly nothing to do; and they are near the rhetorical\r\nside of Criticism herself. The Metaplasms which follow, as purely\r\nverbal, may be claimed by the elder sister, but the _schemata_ and the\r\n_tropi_ are unquestioned usurpations. And thereafter, with Chapter\r\nThirty-Seven _De Prosa_, we are almost on our own ground.\r\n\r\nFootnote 517:\r\n\r\n  The _Origines_ or _Etymologiæ_, as a whole, form vol. iii. of\r\n  Lindemann’s _Corpus Grammaticorum_ (Leipsic, 1833), but this can\r\n  usually be obtained separate, and is worth having. It, of course,\r\n  repeats the _Rhetoric_, which is merely one section of it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 518:\r\n\r\n  See above, p. 374 _sq._\r\n\r\nIsidore, if not (save in his title) very original, is judicious in his\r\nselections from the public stock, and puts them together in a much more\r\nuseful fashion than some authors of “composition-books” a good deal his\r\njuniors. Prose is “a straightforward form of speech freed from metre.”\r\nMetres (he has given “feet” a good deal earlier) are the fixed\r\narrangements of feet which constitute verse. Their names are classified\r\nand accounted for, as are, subsequently, the chief forms of poetry in\r\nwhich they appear. The origination of these is claimed for various\r\nsacred persons—of the Hymn for David, “who was long before Ennius,” of\r\nthe Epithalamium for Solomon. Not a few of the definitions, though\r\ndesultory and oddly selected, are noteworthy, and the considerable space\r\ngiven to that of the Cento is characteristic of the age.\r\n\r\nFable, as has been said, has a section to itself, an honour which is\r\nprophetic of—and considering Isidore’s influence may, to some extent,\r\nhave caused—the great attention paid in the Middle Ages to that kind.\r\nThe History sections, though four in number, are much shorter—indeed,\r\nscarcely so long together as the single one allotted to Fable, which\r\nfact also is true, as the needle is, to the pole of the time. It is much\r\nbetter, Isidore thinks, that a man should only write of what he has\r\nactually seen. But History is not useless reading. Strictly, it is of\r\nour own time; “Annals” of the past; while Ephemeris is a diurnal and\r\nKalendarium a monthly history. Finally the book ends with a contrast of\r\n_historia_, _argumentum_, and _fabula_. The first is of true things\r\nreally done; the second of things which, though they have not been done,\r\nmight be; the third of things which neither have been done nor can be,\r\nbecause they are contrary to nature. Here _argumentum_ clearly looks\r\ntowards oratory: with regard to the difference between _historia_ and\r\n_fabula_, it must be admitted that the ages which followed very\r\nscrupulously forgot their teacher’s warning.\r\n\r\nBut even this does not exhaust our indebtedness to a very agreeable\r\nwork, full of good sense and sound learning. The Sixth Book, which\r\nbegins with an account of the Old and New Testament, diverges to the\r\nconsideration of books generally. A note on famous libraries leads\r\nIsidore to record the chief authorities on Biblical Exegesis, from whom\r\nhe passes to Latin libraries, to others (those of the Martyr Pamphilus\r\nand of Jerome), and thence to authors. Much writing attracts him first:\r\nand Varro, the Greek Chalcenterus, Origen, and St Augustine are picked\r\nout, the not entirely single-edged compliment being paid to the last,\r\nthat not only could nobody write his books by working day and night, but\r\nnobody could read them completely by a similar expenditure of time and\r\nlabour. An odd division of works follows, into _excerpta_ or _scholia_,\r\n“homilies,” and “tomes” or books,[519] or volumes: and this is followed\r\nby a string of remarks, as before rather desultory, on different kinds\r\nof books and writings, commentaries, prefaces, and what not. Then\r\nIsidore passes to the material side, and discusses waxen and wooden\r\ntablets, parchment, paper, with something about _format_. The staff and\r\nthe plant of libraries follow; and then, returning from things profane\r\nto things divine, the book finishes with an account of the Calendar and\r\nthe Offices of the Church.\r\n\r\nFootnote 519:\r\n\r\n  Perhaps this is not so odd as it looks. _Excerpta_ or _scholia_ are,\r\n  _individually_, scraps; “homilies,” or essays, are only parts of a\r\n  book: _tomi_ are books substantive.\r\n\r\nThose to whose taste and intellect this kind of thing appears despicable\r\nmust, of course, be permitted to despise it. Others will prefer to\r\nrecognise, with interest and sympathy, the combination of an extremely\r\nstrong desire for knowledge, and the possession of no small quantity\r\nthereof, not merely with great disadvantages of resource and supply, but\r\nwith a most curious and (if it were not so healthy and so promising)\r\npathetic inability to distinguish, to know exactly where to plant the\r\ngrip, what to discard, what simply to neglect. And they, once more, will\r\nsee in this whole attitude, in this childhood crying for the light,\r\nsomething more encouraging than the complacent illumination of certain\r\nother ages, with which, perhaps, they may be more fully acquainted.\r\n\r\nBede,[520] a century later than Isidore, presents a changed but not a\r\nlesser interest. It is utterly improbable that the Bishop [Sidenote:\r\n_Bede again._] of Seville found himself in face of any vernacular\r\nwriting that could be called in the least literary—if any vernacular\r\nexcept Latin and Old Basque can be supposed to have existed in Spain at\r\nall. Bede’s circumstances were quite different. The most famous passage\r\nin his writings—the story of Cædmon—is sufficient to tell us, even if we\r\ndid not know it from other testimony, and from his extant death-bed\r\nverses, that he was well acquainted with vernacular poetry.\r\n\r\nFootnote 520:\r\n\r\n  Bede’s treatises on Metric and Orthography, besides being accessible\r\n  in the various collected editions of his works, are to be found in\r\n  vol. vii. part ii. of Keil’s _Grammatici Latini_ (Leipsic, 1878).\r\n\r\nBut he seems to have thought it either unnecessary or undesirable to\r\ngive any critical attention to it. His _Ars Metrica_[521], like his\r\n_Orthography_[522] and his _Rhetoric_,[523] concerns [Sidenote: _His_\r\nArs Metrica.] itself strictly with Latin. That this was on the whole\r\nbetter for the time, and so indirectly for us, who are the offspring of\r\nthat time; that it was better for the vernaculars to be left to grow and\r\nseed themselves, and be transformed naturally without any attempt to\r\ntrain and so to cramp them; that it was, on the other hand, all\r\nimportant that the hand of discipline should be kept on the only\r\n“regular” writing, that of Latin—we may not only admit with frankness,\r\nbut most eagerly and spontaneously advance and maintain. But the carnal\r\nman cannot help sighing for a tractate—a tractatule even of the\r\ntiniest—on English verse, from the Venerable One. There are, however, in\r\nthe _Ars Metrica_ one large and several small crumbs of comfort. It is a\r\npity that the learned and accurate Keil should have spoken so\r\nscornfully[524] of the undoubted truth that, while Bede supplements the\r\nprecepts of the old grammarians in no whit, his whole usefulness lies in\r\nregard to the examination of more recent poets, and, as he calls them,\r\n“modern versifiers”; and should, a little further, have still more\r\nscornfully declined[525] to trouble himself with verifying unnamed\r\nreferences to such persons as Prudentius, Sedulius, Venantius\r\nFortunatus, and others. To despise any age of literature is not\r\nliterary: and to ignore it (as the motto which I have ventured to borrow\r\nfrom the excellent Leyser hath it in other words) is not safe. I think\r\nwe may ask Herr Keil this question, “Is it not exactly of the _moderni\r\nversificatores_ that Bede can speak to us with advantage?” Do we, except\r\nby a supererogation of curiosity, want remarks from him on Virgil and\r\nOvid?\r\n\r\nFootnote 521:\r\n\r\n  Ed. cit. (with Introd.), pp. 219-260.\r\n\r\nFootnote 522:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., pp. 261-294.\r\n\r\nFootnote 523:\r\n\r\n  See p. 374.\r\n\r\nFootnote 524:\r\n\r\n  Ed. cit., p. 221.\r\n\r\nFootnote 525:\r\n\r\n  _Ut longum et molestum erat, ita in hoc genere scriptorum parum utile\r\n  esse videbatur._\r\n\r\nBede (who addresses the tract to the same Cuthbert whom we have to thank\r\nfor the charming account of his death) begins with the letter, goes on\r\nto the syllable, and then has a chapter of peculiar interest on _common_\r\nsyllables—those stumbling-blocks to so many modern students of English\r\nprosody. The quantity of syllables in various positions is then dealt\r\nwith successively, and next the metres, cæsura, elision, &c. One may\r\nnote as specially interesting the section _Quæ sit optima Carminis\r\nforma_ (p. 243), both as showing long before, in reference to the\r\nhexameter, the same “striving after the best” which appears in Dante’s\r\nextrication of the _canzone_ and the hendecasyllable from meaner forms\r\nand lines, and as indicating something like a sense of that\r\n“verse-paragraph” which was to be the method of Shakespeare and of\r\nMilton. In dealing with these things he sometimes quotes, and still more\r\nfrequently relies upon, Mallius Theodorus. But the passage which, if it\r\nexisted alone, would make the book valuable (though in that case, as no\r\ndoubt in many others, we should be prone to think that we had lost\r\nsomething more precious than it actually is), comes under the head _De\r\nRhythmo_. After saying that the “Common books of a hundred metres”[526]\r\nwill give many of these which he has omitted, he goes on thus: “But\r\nrhythm seems to be like metres, in that it is a modulated arrangement of\r\nwords, governed not by metrical rule, but _by the number of syllables_,\r\naccording to the judgment of the ear. And there can be rhythm without\r\nmetre, though there can be no metre without rhythm: or, as it may be\r\nmore clearly defined, metre is rhythm with modulation, rhythm modulation\r\nwithout proportion. But for the most part you will find, by a certain\r\nchance, proportion likewise in rhythm: not that any artificial\r\ndiscipline is used, but from the conduct of the sound and the modulation\r\nitself; and such as the poets of the people naturally produce in a\r\nrustic, learned poets in a learned manner.”[527] And then he quotes, as\r\nexamples of iambic and trochaic rhythms respectively, the well-known\r\nhymns, _Rex æterne Domine_ and _Apparebit repentina_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 526:\r\n\r\n  _Libris centimetrorum simplicibus examinata._ “Centimeter” is “the\r\n  poet who employs a hundred metres,” or the critic who discusses them.\r\n  Sidonius (Carm. ix. 264), in a passage referred to above (p. 389),\r\n  applies it to Terentianus Maurus, who certainly deserves it both in\r\n  theory and practice (_v._ his book, ed. Lachmann, Berlin, 1836).\r\n\r\nFootnote 527:\r\n\r\n  _Vulgares poetæ._\r\n\r\nNow this, which, though partly a result of, is quite different from, the\r\nclassical opposition of rhythm and metre, is a thing of the first\r\nimportance, and could not have been said by any one who had neglected\r\nthe _moderni versificatores_: while it would perhaps not have been said\r\nso clearly and well by any one who had not known, and paid some\r\nattention to, the rising vernaculars. Even if, as Keil thinks, Bede\r\nfollowed such writers as Victorinus and Audax, he confirmed and\r\nstrengthened this following by his study of recent verse.\r\n\r\nI do not perceive any great crux in this passage: but Guest[528] was\r\npuzzled by the phrase _numero syllabarum_, which he seems to have taken\r\nas meaning that rhythm was more, not less, strict than metre in syllabic\r\nregularity. I am not sure that the words bear this interpretation: but,\r\neven if they did, we must remember that the rhythms _of which Bede was\r\nspeaking_ are very strict syllabically, and admit little or no\r\nequivalence. The more prudish hymn-writers even dislike elision, and\r\ngive every syllable its value.\r\n\r\nFootnote 528:\r\n\r\n  _History of English Rhythms_, Bk. iii. chap. vi. (p. 472, ed. Skeat).\r\n  He also speaks of “discrepancies” in the different copies: but Keil’s\r\n  _apparatus_ gives no important variants in the MSS.\r\n\r\nIt is not from caprice or idleness that the somewhat minute examination\r\nthus given to the opening centuries of the Dark [Sidenote: _The Central\r\nMiddle Ages to be more rapidly passed over._] or early Middle Ages will\r\nnow be exchanged for a more rapid flight over the central portion of the\r\nsame division of history. There are two very good reasons for this\r\ncourse. The first is, that there is a very great absence, probably of\r\nall material, certainly of material that is accessible. The second is,\r\nthat even if such material existed and could be got at, it would\r\nprobably be of little if of any service. When conditions of rhythmical\r\ncomposition in Latin were once settled, that composition was pursued\r\nwith delightful results,[529] but with half traditional, half\r\ninstinctive, absence of critical inquiry as to form. It was impossible\r\nthat any such inquiry should take place, in the case of the vernaculars,\r\nuntil they had reached a state of actual creative development, which\r\nnone of them enjoyed till the twelfth century, and hardly any of them\r\ntill the thirteenth. As for appreciation, other than traditional, of\r\nauthors classical, patristic, or contemporary, this was rendered a rare\r\nthing by that very mental constitution of the Middle Ages which has\r\nalready been often referred to, and which will be more fully discussed\r\nin the Interchapter following this book. This constitution, rich in many\r\npriceless qualities, almost entirely lacked self-detachment on the one\r\nhand, and egotistic introspection on the other. It can very seldom have\r\noccurred to any Mediæval to isolate himself from the usual estimate of\r\nwriters—to separate his opinion of their formal excellence from the\r\ninterest, or the use, of their contents. And even if it had so occurred\r\nto any one, he would probably not have thought that opinion worth\r\ncommunicating. From which things, much more than from the assumed\r\nshallowness or puerility, a thousand years saw an almost astoundingly\r\nsmall change in regard to the matters with which we deal. Boethius and\r\nMartianus are text-books to the early sixteenth century as to the early\r\nsixth: the satirical lampoons of the religious wars in France burlesque\r\nthe form, and use the language, of the hymns of Venantius\r\nFortunatus:[530] Hawes and Douglas look at literature and science with\r\nthe eyes of Isidore, if not even of Cassiodorus. Whether this\r\nconservatism did not invite, disastrously, the reaction of the\r\nRenaissance-criticism, we shall have to consider later; it is certain\r\nthat it limits, very notably, the material of the present book, and\r\nespecially of this portion of the present chapter. On two very\r\nremarkable books of the earliest thirteenth century, the _Labyrinthus_\r\nattributed to Eberhard, and the _Nova Poetria_ of Geoffrey de Vinsauf,\r\nwe may dwell with the utmost advantage. Otherwise a few notes, chiefly\r\non the formal _Arts Poetic_ of the mid-Middle Age, are not only all that\r\nneed, but almost all that can, be given before we turn to the great\r\nmediæval document of our subject, the _De Vulgari Eloquio_ of Dante.\r\n\r\nFootnote 529:\r\n\r\n  For the understanding reader there is perhaps no subdivision of\r\n  literature more constantly delectable and refreshing than the Latin\r\n  hymns of the sixth-thirteenth centuries on the one hand, and on the\r\n  other the lighter work contained in such collections as the _Carmina\r\n  Burana_, Edélestand du Méril’s _three_ issues of _Poésies Populaires\r\n  Latines_, Wright’s _Poems of Walter Mapes_, _&c._\r\n\r\nFootnote 530:\r\n\r\n  Cf. the ferocious, but vigorous, lampoon on Catherine of Montpensier\r\n  and Jacques Clément, entitled _Prosa Cleri Parisiensis ad ducem de\r\n  Mena_ (_Anciennes Poésies Françaises_, vol. ii. _Bibl. Elzévirienne_:\r\n  Paris, 1855).\r\n\r\nIn the vernacular languages it is hardly necessary to do more than refer\r\nto the instructions for accomplishing the intricacies [Sidenote:\r\n_Provençal and Latin treatises._] of Provençal verse found in that\r\ntongue;[531] the Latin rhythmics are rather more interesting. Until\r\nquite recently, access to them, save in the case of those students who\r\nunite palæographical accomplishment with leisure and means to travel all\r\nover Europe, was almost confined to two precious collections, the\r\n_Reliquiæ Antiquæ_ of Wright and Halliwell, and the plump and pleasing\r\nvolume of Polycarp Leyser, which, among its varied treasures, gives the\r\nentire _Labyrinthus_ of Eberhard, the most important of them all. Now,\r\nhowever, the really admirable industry of Signor Giovanni Mari has\r\ncollected, not merely the metrical part of the _Labyrinthus_, and the\r\nwork (also rather famous) of John de Garlandia, but no less than six\r\nothers, all of the thirteenth or fourteenth centuries.[532] It is indeed\r\nnot impossible that the first of these, the _De Rhythmico Dictamine_,\r\nmay in its original have been as old as the twelfth, to which the\r\n_Labyrinthus_ itself used also to be assigned.\r\n\r\nFootnote 531:\r\n\r\n  _V._ Bartsch, _Grundriss zur Gesch. der Prov. Lit._, p. 65 _sq._, on\r\n  Faidit’s _Donat_, Ramon Vidal’s _Rasos de Trobar_, &c.\r\n\r\nFootnote 532:\r\n\r\n  _Reliquiæ Antiquæ_, by T. Wright & J. O.

Mari, _I Trattate Medievali di Ritmica Latina_, Milan, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe _Dictamen_,[533] the MSS. of which are found all over Europe, is\r\nvery short. It lays down firmly the principle, which was [Sidenote:\r\n_The_ De Dictamine Rhythmico.] later to differentiate Romance from\r\nTeutonic, especially English, prosody, that _rhythmus est consonans\r\nparitas syllabarum sub certo numere comprehensarum_; it sets the limits\r\nof the line at a minimum of four syllables and a maximum of fourteen; it\r\ndesigns rhyme throughout as _consonance_; it gives examples from\r\nwell-known hymns, from the poems attributed to Mapes and some not\r\nelsewhere known; and it supplies minute distinctions of kind as\r\n“transformed,” “equicomous,” “orbiculate,” “serpentine” rhythms. The\r\ntractatule is strictly limited to rhythm proper: classical metres do not\r\nappear in it. A rehandling by a certain “Master Sion” differs in its\r\nexamples, and is rather more minute in its subdivisions: and there is\r\nyet a third version or pair of versions showing the authority and\r\ngeneral influence of the treatise, while the _Regulæ de Rhythmis_ hardly\r\ndiffer essentially, and lead to the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nFootnote 533:\r\n\r\n  First given in _Reliquiæ Antiquæ_, i. 30-32. The others (except the\r\n  _Labyrinthus_) are in Mari only.\r\n\r\nThe _Ars Rhythmica_ of John de Garlandia is a much more elaborate\r\ncomposition, which originally followed upon similar [Sidenote: _John of\r\nGarlandia._] treatments of “prose” and “metre.” It is remarkable on the\r\none hand for giving, not mere verses, but whole poems as examples, and\r\non the other for varying the same theme in different rhythmical\r\ndispositions. The terms of ancient metric are also borrowed rather more\r\nfreely than in the _Dictamen_; and great attention is paid to\r\n“rhetorical colours” of verse—homœoteleuton and the like. It is much\r\nlonger than any form of the _Dictamen_, and has a supplement dealing\r\nwith the strictly metrical forms usual in hymns. This does not exhibit\r\nthe learned John Garland (he may have been an Englishman) as an expert\r\nin literary history, since he writes: “Saphicum, a Sapho _muliere\r\nquadam_ quæ fuit inventrix hujus metri: adonicum ab Adone inventore.”\r\nBut in his liberal contribution of probably original examples he\r\nincludes an _Oda de Archidiacono_, which might have been useful in a\r\nfamous investigation. In fact, probably a major part of the treatise\r\nconsists of not very excellent verse.\r\n\r\nSignor Mari, conformably to his plan, has given of the\r\n_Labyrinthus_[534] only the short section dealing actually with\r\n[Sidenote: _The_ Labyrinthus.] rhythm: but the whole poem is of very\r\ngreat interest and importance for us—indeed of more than any work known\r\nto me between Isidore and Dante. The work, which is otherwise called _De\r\nMiseriis Rectorum Scholarum_, is an elaborate treatise on pædagogics. In\r\nthe progress and details of this, the writer seems to forget the\r\nlugubrious estimate of his profession with which he starts, and which\r\ngoes so far as to lay down that the future schoolmaster is cursed in his\r\nmother’s womb. Very sound rules are however given for guiding the moral\r\nnature and conduct of this unfortunate functionary; and then his various\r\nbusinesses are systematically attacked in elegiacs, not at all\r\ncontemptible with due allowance. The second part deals with “themes,”\r\ngrammar, and, to some extent, composition in general, though the\r\nexamples, like the lecture, are in verse; the third with versification.\r\nAnd here we get a really precious estimate of various authors,\r\nostensibly for their educational value, but, as in Quintilian’s case,\r\ngoing a good deal further. Indeed, hardly since Quintilian’s own time\r\nhave we had such a critical summary. Cato, a special darling of the\r\nMiddle Age, is “a path of virtue and a rule of Morals,” [Sidenote:\r\n_Critical review of poets contained in it._] “though the brevity of his\r\nmetre forbids him to polish his words.” Theodolus,[535] a tenth-century\r\nwriter of _Eclogæ_, who “champions” (is this the sense of _arcet_?) the\r\ncause of truth against falsehood, “and in whose verse theology plays,”\r\ncomes next; and then the far better known Avianus, the instructive and\r\nmoral virtue of whose fables is acknowledged, though he is debited\r\n_pauperiore stylo_. In one of the puns so dear to the sensible Middle\r\nAges, _Æsopus metrum non sopit_—_i.e._, writes no dull or sleepy\r\nverse—and is otherwise highly praised. Maximianus[536] and Pamphilus\r\n(the original of the _Celestina_) follow, and “Geta,”[537] and a punning\r\nreference[538] to Claudian’s _Rape of Proserpine_. Statius, of course,\r\nis praised, indeed twice over. The “pleasing” work of Ovid, the “satire\r\nof the Venusian,” the “not juvenile but mature” ditto of Juvenal, which\r\n“lays bare and never cloaks vice”; Persius of the lofty soul, who spares\r\nno subtlety of mind though he is a lover of brevity, come next, while to\r\nthese great satirists of old, the _Architrenius_[539] of John of\r\nHauteville is yoked, with less injustice than may seem likely to\r\ndevotees of classic and scorners of mediæval literature. The inevitable\r\neccentricity (to _us_) of the mediæval estimate, and probably also the\r\nperseverance of the wooden censorship of Servius, is shown by the fact\r\nthat only Virgil’s “themes,” not his treatment, are noticed, except\r\nobliquely. The second notice of Statius for the _Thebaid_, as the first\r\nhad been for the _Achilleid_, is less reticent, praising him as _eloquii\r\njucundus melle_; and Lucan is said to sing _metro lucidiore_, while an\r\n_Alexandreid_ (no doubt that of Gautier of Châtillon), though described\r\nas “shining by Lucan’s light,” is extolled as a historical poem.\r\nClaudian, again by allusion, receives praise for his praise of Stilicho,\r\nand Dares (as we expect with resignation) for his “veracity”; indeed the\r\nclerestories toward that south-north are quite as lustrous as ebony.\r\nStill Homer is placed beside him without depreciation, unless the\r\nmention of _Argolicum dolum_ is intended as a stigma. The couplet\r\nfollowing—\r\n\r\n                “Sidonii regis qui pingit prælia morem\r\n                    Egregium calamus Sidonianus habet”—\r\n\r\nis annotated by Leyser “Apollonius,” but there seems some difficulty in\r\nthis Apollonius. _Rhodius_ has nothing to do with Tyre or Sidon; and\r\nApollonius _of Tyre_ has very little to do with _prælia_. The poet\r\nalluded to, whoever he is, possesses a pen with a noble manner. A\r\nSalimarius or Solinarius, who sang of the crusades, may be any versifier\r\nof William of Tyre: unless, indeed, the phrase _plenus amore crucis_\r\nrefers to one of the numerous poems on the Invention of the Cross.\r\nMacer’s matter is praised, but not his verse, _non sapit ille metro_—a\r\ntrue Quintilianian judgment. Petrus Riga (_petra cujus rigat Cristus_)\r\nescapes better. Sedulius is noted for “sedulity” of metre, and Arator\r\n“ploughs” the apostolic facts well, while Prudentius, of course, is\r\nprudent.\r\n\r\nFootnote 534:\r\n\r\n  Or _Laborintus_. The adoption of an “Eberhard of Bethune” as the\r\n  author is not universally granted, nor the dating at 1212. But the\r\n  exact authorship is not of the slightest importance to us, and the\r\n  exact date not of much. The whole poem is printed by Leyser, p. 795\r\n  _sq._\r\n\r\nFootnote 535:\r\n\r\n  Or Theodulus: _v._ Leyser, _op. cit._, p. 825 _sq._\r\n\r\nFootnote 536:\r\n\r\n  This barbarous, and to Mrs Grundy shocking, but by no means\r\n  uninteresting versifier, was a great favourite with the Middle Ages.\r\n  He may be found conveniently in Baehrens, _Poetæ Latini Minores_, v.\r\n  313 _sq._\r\n\r\nFootnote 537:\r\n\r\n  Leyser oddly annotated _Geta gemens_ “titulus tragediæ,” but the\r\n  words—\r\n\r\n                            “Quia captus Mercuriali\r\n                  Arte Jovem lectus Amphitrionis habet”—\r\n\r\n  can only refer to an _Amphitryon_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 538:\r\n\r\n             “Thesiphones raptum qui comptus carmine claudit\r\n             Arte nec ingenio claudicat ille suo.”\r\n\r\n  To abduct Tisiphone would be a feather in the cap of any Don Juan, for\r\n  audacity if not for taste; but the text is corrupt enough to make it\r\n  (as it is elsewhere) an easy _f.l._ for Persephone. The puns in\r\n  _claudit_ and _claudicat_, moreover, are practically decisive.\r\n\r\nFootnote 539:\r\n\r\n  This remarkable twelfth-century poem—_v. infra_, note, p. 414, an\r\n  allegorical world-pilgrimage with special reference to student sojourn\r\n  at Paris—was first abstracted by Wright in his _Biographia Britannica\r\n  Literaria_, vol. ii., London, 1846, and afterwards published in full\r\n  by him (_Anglo-Latin Satirical Poets of the Twelfth Century_, London,\r\n  1872). John of Hauteville or Anville is also credited with a MS.\r\n  treatise, _De Epistolarum Compositione_. I wish I had seen it.\r\n\r\nAlanus (de Insulis: “Alanus who was very sage,” as Pierre de la Sippade,\r\nthe translator of _Paris and Vienne_ from Provençal into French says) is\r\ncited for his dealing with the Seven Arts in the _Anti-Claudianus_; and\r\nhalf-a-dozen lines of rather obscure allusiveness are devoted to\r\nMatthias Vindocinensis on Tobit, Geoffrey of Vinsauf (_v. infra_), and\r\nAlexander of Villedieu. Prosper _doctrinæ prosperitate sapit_; and the\r\nlist is closed by fresh praises of the above Matthias or Matthew, of\r\nMartianus Capella and his “happy style,” of Boethius, Bernardus, the\r\n_Physiologus_, Paraclitus (?), and Sidonius Apollinaris.[540]\r\n\r\nFootnote 540:\r\n\r\n  _Physiologus_ is of course the famous piece of Thetbaldus, the\r\n  original—mediate or immediate—of all the vernacular _Bestiaries_.\r\n  “Paraclitus” Leyser prints in capitals, like the other titles of books\r\n  or authors:—\r\n\r\n              “Hortatur propria per scripta PARACLITUS omnes\r\n              Peccantes. Veniam gratia donat iis.”\r\n\r\n  I should myself have taken this for a reference to the Holy Spirit as\r\n  speaking through the moralities of the _Physiologus_. The false\r\n  quantity is, of course, no objection to this: the 3rd syllable is\r\n  short at pleasure from Prudentius onwards. For poems of Matthias\r\n  Vindocinensis see _Reliquiæ Antiquæ_, ii. 257 _sq._ There is some\r\n  merit in them.\r\n\r\nThis catalogue, partly reasoned, is precious, as showing what the\r\n“Thirty best books” of the age of Dante’s birth were. It is succeeded by\r\nmetrical and rhythmical directions, characterised by a good deal of\r\npunning as above, but also by acuteness and knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe extract from the _Labyrinthus_ given by Signor Mari is followed in\r\nhis book by two other rhythmical tractates of [Sidenote: _Minor\r\nrhythmical tractates._] small importance, one very short, from a MS. in\r\nthe Monaco library, and a longer one, but much later (it is probably as\r\nlate as 1400), by a certain Nicolo Tibino. This last is chiefly\r\nnoteworthy as giving fewer examples, but much exposition and discussion:\r\nit is indeed, after the custom of these ancestors, a kind of commentary\r\non the _Labyrinthus_.\r\n\r\nBut, as it happens, the next piece to the _Labyrinthus_ in Leyser is a\r\ntreatise of interest as great as its own, if not greater, the _Poetria\r\nNova_ of Geoffrey de Vinsauf. Geoffrey, who, despite his French-sounding\r\nname, was certainly a [Sidenote: _Geoffrey de Vinsauf: his_ Nova\r\nPoetria.] countryman of ours, has been rather unkindly treated by us.\r\nChaucer bestowed upon him one of his most ingeniously humorous\r\ngibes,[541] and Mr Wright (the most faithful and enthusiastic guardian\r\nand restorer of our Latin poets, and usually as tolerant as any, this\r\nside of mere critical omnivorousness) uses hard language of him in the\r\n_Biographia Britannica Literaria_.[542] But he is too valuable to us to\r\nbe here abused: rather shall we be grateful to him exceedingly for\r\nrevealing the literary tastes and ideals of the age as they lived. The\r\n_New Poetic_[543] begins by one of those mediæval gambades which,\r\nthemselves sometimes partaking of the not unamiably nonsensical, seem at\r\nthe present day to have a special gift of maddening those persons whose\r\nimbecility is of a different complexion from theirs. Geoffrey dedicates\r\nhis poem to Pope Innocent III. (“stupor mundi”), and is at once in a\r\ndifficulty. It would not do to call the Pope _Nocens_; _Innocens_ is\r\nsimply impossible in a hexameter. So he plays about the subject for a\r\nscore or so of lines, adding eulogistic jocular remarks on other\r\nChristian names, especially in relation to the Papacy. “Augustine may\r\nhold his tongue: Leo be quiet: John leave off: Gregory halt,”[544] while\r\nInnocent is comparable with Bartlemy in nobility, with Andrew in\r\nmildness, with St John himself in precious youth, in faith with Peter,\r\nin consummate scholarship with Paul. Then Rome is praised in comparison\r\nwith England, and the poet-professor-of-poetry plunges into his subject.\r\n\r\nFootnote 541:\r\n\r\n  _Nun’s Priest’s Tale_, 527 _sq._\r\n\r\nFootnote 542:\r\n\r\n  _Anglo-Norman Period_, vol. ii. p. 398 _sq._\r\n\r\nFootnote 543:\r\n\r\n  Leyser, _op. cit._, pp. 855-986.\r\n\r\nFootnote 544:\r\n\r\n               “Augustine tace. Leo papa quiesce. Johannes\r\n               Desine. Gregori subsiste.”\r\n\r\nHis value, even if it were more flawed and alloyed than it is, will\r\nappear at once from the simple statement of the fact that, unlike the\r\ngreat majority of mediæval writers (such as they are) on literature, he\r\ndoes not confine himself to form on the one hand, and on the other does\r\nnot adopt, in handling his subject, the extreme cut-and-dried rhetorical\r\nrestrictions, though his own conception of the matter is more or less\r\nregulated by them. I do not remember that he ever quotes Horace; but it\r\nis pretty certain that he had the _Ars Poetica_ before him. He opens\r\nwith the most solemn and elaborate commands to the poet not to rush upon\r\nhis subject, to leave nothing to chance, but to form the conception of\r\nthe work carefully and completely beforehand. “A little gall embitters a\r\nwhole mass of honey, and one spot makes a whole face ugly.” In his\r\nsecond chapter he becomes more closely rhetorical. The poet must first\r\nchoose and arrange his subject; then elaborate and amplify it; then\r\nclothe it in “civil, not rustic” words; and lastly, study its proper\r\nrecitation or delivery. Under the first head the _mot d’ordre_ is order:\r\nthe very word _ordo_ occurs over and over again in the first dozen or\r\nsixteen lines. The exordium must look straight to the end: and all the\r\nother parts must follow according to the regular drill of a “theme.”\r\nSpecial attention is given to the employment of Examples and Proverbs.\r\nUnder the head of treatment, Brevity, Amplification, and all the\r\nscholastic tricks of style are inculcated again with plentiful examples,\r\nthese including that unlucky passage against Friday which tempted the\r\nwicked wit of another Geoffrey. It is, however, fair to say that He of\r\nthe Sound Wine does not himself seem to have been by any means destitute\r\nof a certain sense of humour, and demands ridicule of the ridiculous. If\r\nby his precept, and still more by his examples, Geoffrey seems too much\r\nto encourage word-play as a lighter, and bombast as a graver, ornament\r\nof composition, it is well to remember that the fashions of every time\r\nare not only liable to exaggeration, but nearly always exhibit it.\r\nProfessional students of literature have no difficulty in putting a name\r\nto such exaggerations in the thirteenth, the sixteenth, or the\r\neighteenth century; nor will such students in the future have any more\r\nin performing the same office for the literary fashions of the late\r\nnineteenth. Nor are some of the prescriptions for figure, and fanciful\r\ncolour and conceit, by any means infelicitous—always supposing that such\r\nthings can be made the subject of regular prescription at all. On the\r\nother hand, it must be admitted that Geoffrey is sometimes painfully\r\nrudimentary. The budding poet who requires to be told that\r\n\r\n               “Aptantur bene dentes nix; labra flammæ;\r\n         Gustus mel; vultus rosa; frons lac; crines et aurum;”\r\n\r\nand who then obediently “goes and does it,” is a person with whose works\r\nreviewers (for their sins) are indeed still well acquainted, but to whom\r\nno philanthropist would willingly give encouragement.\r\n\r\nThis descent to even the lowest ranges of the particular is, however,\r\none of the most interesting points of the book. There are some two\r\nthousand lines in all, and the whole, except the dedication and three\r\nnot very long epilogue-addresses to Pope, Emperor, and a certain\r\nArchbishop William (who has not, I think, been identified), is strictly\r\ndevoted to business.\r\n\r\nThis poem is, on fair authority, assigned to the year 1216, the\r\n_Labyrinthus_ being dated some four years earlier. And, without pinning\r\nour faith to these dates and so running the danger of its unsettlement\r\nshould they be attacked, we may say quite boldly that the _Labyrinthus_\r\nand the _Nova Poetria_[545] together give us a remarkable and nearly\r\ncomplete conspectus of what the late twelfth and early thirteenth\r\ncentury thought about literature, in what was still its almost\r\nall-embracing form—poetry, in both its rhythmical and metrical\r\nshapes—and in the only thoroughly acknowledged literary language of the\r\ntime. For although the vernaculars were already knocking at the door,\r\nthey were doing so as yet timidly and half consciously, while in so far\r\nas they were deliberately practised, the principles of composition and\r\nof taste which guided the practice cannot have been different. We find,\r\nif not always with exactly the same _nuance_, terms of Dante’s critical\r\nvocabulary (_e.g._, “pexa”) in the _Poetria Nova_. And though neither\r\nEberhard nor Geoffrey would in all probability have had anything but\r\nscorn for the suggestion that “vulgar” could possibly equal “regular”\r\ncomposition; though they were at best men of respectable talent; their\r\ngeneral critical estimate was probably not very different from that of\r\ntheir great successor on the bridge of the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies. Of his eagle glance into the future of literature they were\r\nentirely destitute, but he shared at least some of their confused vision\r\nin reference to the past.[546]\r\n\r\nFootnote 545:\r\n\r\n  Three other poems of the twelfth or early thirteenth century (referred\r\n  to above) are more original, two of them at least are more amusing,\r\n  and all have obtained more notice from general literary historians.\r\n  These are the _Speculum Stultorum_ or _Brunellus_ of Nigel Wireker,\r\n  the _Architrenius_ (see p. 410) of John of Hauteville, and the\r\n  _Anti-Claudianus_ of Alanus de Insulis. All three may be found most\r\n  conveniently in Wright’s above-cited work, _Anglo-Latin Satirical\r\n  Poets of the Twelfth Century_ (2 vols., Rolls Series, London, 1872).\r\n  They are by no means to be neglected by us, though their testimony is\r\n  mostly negative, and a slight reference to its nature will cover,\r\n  indirectly, the absence of reference in the text to such still more\r\n  generally famous authors as John of Salisbury and Walter Mapes\r\n  himself. It is probable that all five writers, as well as Godfrey of\r\n  Winchester (also in Wright, _op. cit._), who could write fair epigrams\r\n  in the more decent style of Martial, and others, were well acquainted\r\n  with no inconsiderable part of the classics. Upon satirists, moreover,\r\n  like Wireker and John of Hauteville, who were attacking the vanity of\r\n  monkish and clerical life, hopes, and ambitions, the labour-in-vain of\r\n  Universities, and the like, some such indirect but substantive\r\n  literary criticism as we find in their Roman originals would seem\r\n  almost imperative. But there is nothing of the kind, either in the\r\n  _Speculum_ or in the _Architrenius_. In the much duller\r\n  _Anti-Claudianus_, Rhetoric, like the other arts, appears, and she is\r\n  employed, consistently with her presentation in Martianus (though the\r\n  Rhetoric of Capella would perhaps have been too proud to do this\r\n  directly) to “paint and gild the pole” of the allegorical Chariot of\r\n  Prudence. But of criticism there is nothing, or so little as to be\r\n  nothing. Nor will much be found in the interesting notice of mediæval\r\n  notices of books and book collections which occurs in M. Cocheris’ ed.\r\n  of the _Philobiblon_ (_v. infra_, p. 455), pp. xxxiv-xlvii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 546:\r\n\r\n  If to this peculiarity I seem to refer too often, let me close this\r\n  chapter with a sentence from one who loved the Middle Ages as well as\r\n  any man, and knew them far better than almost any. To them, says M.\r\n  Paulin Paris, “Les siècles passés ne semblaient former qu’une seule et\r\n  grande époque, où se réunissaient toutes les célébrités de\r\n  l’histoire.”—_Les Romans de la Table Ronde_, i. 169 (Paris: 1868-77).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                                 DANTE.\r\n\r\nTHE ‘DE VULGARI ELOQUIO’: ITS HISTORY AND AUTHENTICATION—ITS IMPORTANCE,\r\n    AND THE SCANTY RECOGNITION THEREOF—ABSTRACT OF ITS CONTENTS: THE\r\n    “VULGAR TONGUE” AND “GRAMMAR”—THE NATURE, ETC., OF THE GIFT OF\r\n    SPEECH—DIVISION OF CONTEMPORARY TONGUES, AND OF THE SUBDIVISIONS OF\r\n    ROMANCE—THE ‘ITALIAN DIALECTS’: SOME REJECTED AT ONCE—OTHERS:\r\n    SICILIAN, APULIAN, TUSCAN, AND GENOESE—VENETIAN: SOME GOOD IN\r\n    BOLOGNESE—THE “ILLUSTRIOUS” LANGUAGE NONE OF THESE, BUT THEIR COMMON\r\n    MEASURE—ITS FOUR CHARACTERISTICS—THE SECOND BOOK: WHY DANTE DEALS\r\n    WITH POETRY ONLY—ALL GOOD POETRY SHOULD BE IN THE “ILLUSTRIOUS”—THE\r\n    SUBJECTS OF HIGH POETRY: WAR, LOVE, VIRTUE—ITS FORM:\r\n    CANZONI—DEFINITION OF POETRY—ITS STYLES, AND THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE\r\n    GRAND STYLE—“SUPERBIA CARMINUM”—“CONSTRUCTIONIS ELATIO”—“EXCELLENTIA\r\n    VERBORUM”—“PEXA ET HIRSUTA”—THE CANZONE—IMPORTANCE OF THIS\r\n    BOOK—INDEPENDENCE AND NOVELTY OF ITS METHOD—DANTE’S ATTENTION TO\r\n    FORM—HIS DISREGARD OF ORATORY—THE INFLUENCE ON HIM OF ROMANCE, AND\r\n    OF COMPARATIVE CRITICISM—THE POETICAL DIFFERENTIA ACCORDING TO\r\n    HIM—HIS ANTIDOTE TO THE WORDSWORTHIAN HERESY—HIS HANDLING OF\r\n    METRE—OF DICTION—HIS STANDARDS OF STYLE—THE “CHAPTER OF THE\r\n    SIEVE”—THE “PEXA”—THE “HIRSUTA”—OTHER CRITICAL “LOCI” IN DANTE: THE\r\n    EPISTLE TO CAN GRANDE—THE “CONVITO”—DANTE ON TRANSLATION—ON LANGUAGE\r\n    AS SHOWN IN PROSE AND VERSE—FINAL REMARKS ON HIS CRITICISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany are the fortunes of books and the curiosities of them: but there\r\nare few which exceed, in curiosity of many kinds, the history,\r\ncharacter, and fate of the treatise variously entitled _De Vulgari\r\nEloquentia_ and _De Vulgari Eloquio_, and attributed generally, if not\r\nuniversally, to Dante Alighieri.[547] Its mere history is unusual. In\r\nthe fifth chapter of the first book of [Sidenote: _The_ De Vulgari\r\nEloquio. _Its history and authentication._] the _Convito_, Dante says\r\nthat he shall speak elsewhere more fully, on the subject of Latin and\r\nthe Vernacular, in a book which, D.V., he intends to write on _Volgare\r\nEloquenza_. Boccaccio further says that very near his death he did write\r\nit, and the statement is confirmed by Villani. These mentions give it us\r\nas written in Latin prose and in two books, but after them we hear\r\nnothing about it. In 1529 the poet and dramatist Trissino printed at\r\nVicenza an Italian translation of it, not under his own name, but under\r\nthat of Giovan Battista Doria. No indication was given that this was not\r\nthe original, and for a time it was taken as such. But in 1577 Jacopo\r\nCorbinelli published, at Paris, the Latin Text. The MS. which he used,\r\nand which for centuries was supposed to be unique, appears to be that\r\nrediscovered at Grenoble in 1840, and published in facsimile by MM.\r\nMaignien and Prompt in 1892; but there are two other early MSS. One of\r\nthese, belonging to the Trivulzi, is taken to be as old, perhaps, as the\r\nGrenoble, both not improbably being older than 1400. A third, at the\r\nVatican, is a century younger, but still some twenty years older than\r\nthe first printed (and translated) edition. The usual difficulties have\r\nbeen started over these facts, and over some supposed contradictions\r\nbetween the treatise and Dante’s more certain work. But these concern us\r\nlittle, and may be sought, by those who want them, in the editions of\r\nthe book. It is sufficient to say that few books have a better external\r\ntestimony, and that the internal difficulties (some of which will be\r\nreferred to later) are quite insignificant.\r\n\r\nFootnote 547:\r\n\r\n  The choice between _Eloquentia_ and _Eloquium_ lies with the taste and\r\n  fancy of the chooser. The first word occurs first in the treatise\r\n  itself. The second is in the title of the Grenoble MS. The texts which\r\n  I use are, for the Latin, Dr Prompt’s facsimile of this MS., Venice,\r\n  Olschki, 1892, and Dr Moore’s edition of the _Opere_ (Oxford, 1897),\r\n  with Mr Ferrers-Howell’s annotated English translation (London, 1890).\r\n  This latter is very good as a whole, though of course one may differ\r\n  as to the rendering of individual terms. The edition of the Società\r\n  Dantesca by Signor P. Rajna (Florence, 1896) is elaborated with all\r\n  the minute care by which scholarship in the looser modern vernaculars\r\n  endeavours to put itself on a level with that in the older and exacter\r\n  tongues. Unfortunately the emulation, here as elsewhere, is carried as\r\n  far as the old unworthy tricks of depreciation and abuse of\r\n  predecessors and rivals. The elaborate commentary is limited, with an\r\n  almost ferocious scrupulosity, to the barest letter of the text; but\r\n  another volume containing literary annotation is promised.\r\n\r\nWe may take it then on its own showing; and, without haggling about\r\ndates, be reasonably confident that it was written [Sidenote: _Its\r\nimportance._] after Dante’s banishment, and of course before his\r\ndeath—that is to say, in the opening years of the fourteenth century.\r\nForgery is practically out of the question, for, as has been said, the\r\noldest manuscripts are some century and a quarter older than Trissino’s\r\nversion, and there could be no conceivable reason why any one late in\r\nthe fourteenth century—even if he had the wits to forge such a thing,\r\nwhich is begging a huge question—should have abstained from reaping the\r\nsole advantage derivable from such a forgery by making it known as\r\nDante’s. We take it, then—and may take it with confidence very nearly if\r\nnot completely absolute—as in two different ways a document of the very\r\nhighest value, even before its intrinsic worth is considered at all. In\r\nthe first place, there is the importance of date, which gives us in it\r\nthe first critical treatise on the literary use of the vernacular, at\r\nexactly the point when the various vernaculars of Europe had finished,\r\nmore or less, their first stage. Secondly, there is the importance of\r\nauthorship, in that we have, as is hardly anywhere else the case, the\r\ngreatest creative writer, not merely of one literature but of a whole\r\nperiod of the European world, betaking himself to criticism. If\r\nShakespeare had written the _Discoveries_ instead of Ben Jonson, the\r\nonly possible analogue would have been supplied. Even Homer could not\r\nhave given us a third, for he could hardly have had the literature to\r\nwork upon.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, however, the book, as I shall hope to show, would\r\nbe of almost the highest interest if it were anonymous. [Sidenote: _And\r\nthe scanty recognition thereof._] Its intrinsic value has been by no\r\nmeans universally recognised: indeed I hardly know any editor or critic\r\nof Dante who has put it in quite its right place. This is, I venture in\r\nall humility to think, due mainly to the fact that the historic estimate\r\nof criticism in general has hitherto been so rarely taken, and so\r\nscantily based. But there are minor reasons. In the first place, the\r\nbook, except by professed Dantists, has been very little studied.[548]\r\nAnd in the second, what I shall endeavour to prove to be its greatest\r\nvalue may, in the curious critical prejudices which still prevail so\r\nlargely, have told positively against it. It has shocked people to find\r\nthe author of the _Commedia_ indulging in grammatical and prosodic\r\nscholasticism; and the shocked ones either do not pause to ask, or\r\nrefuse to answer, the question whether the said scholasticism had not a\r\ngood deal to do with the quality of the _Commedia_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 548:\r\n\r\n  Coleridge, I think, refers to it; but with no adequate recognition.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of other books of importance, we may give a pretty full\r\nabstract of the book, which will be all the more desirable in that it\r\nis, as has been said, far from well known. The Latin, though not very\r\ncrabbed, is sometimes peculiar, and some of the terms require careful\r\nelucidation.\r\n\r\nDante begins by stating in due form his reasons for writing; the absence\r\nof any treatise of the kind, the importance of the [Sidenote: _Abstract\r\nof its contents: The “Vulgar Tongue” and “Grammar.”_] subject, and so\r\nforth. He is going to write about the Vulgar Tongue, and this Vulgar\r\nTongue is that which we acquire, without any rule, by imitating our\r\nnurses. But, he says, we also have another and secondary speech, which\r\nthe Romans called Grammar. The Greeks also have it, and other nations,\r\nbut not all, while comparatively few individuals possess it, because its\r\nacquisition means time and trouble. And the Vulgar Tongue is nobler,\r\nbecause it is more natural: so we shall treat of it.\r\n\r\nHere a slight _crux_ arises as to what Dante meant by “Grammar”: at\r\nleast (for the first part of his observations is clear enough) what he\r\nmeant by saying that “the Greeks have it, and others but not all.”[549]\r\nAre _Grammatica_ and “Latin” interchangeable terms? or does he mean that\r\nthere was a literary as well as a vernacular form of Greek, and literary\r\nas well as vernacular forms of Hebrew, Arabic, &c.? The latter seems to\r\nsuit the argument best up to a certain point; but it is exposed to the\r\ndifficulty that, if so, Dante would be trying to make, out of the\r\nVulgars, a _Grammatica_ for Italian, which nowhere seems to have been\r\nhis intention. But it is no great matter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 549:\r\n\r\n  _Hanc quidem secundariam Græci habent et alii sed non omnes._\r\n\r\nHe has so far cleared his ground very well; but, to his own orderly and\r\nscholastically educated mind, he does not seem to [Sidenote: _The\r\nnature, &c., of the gift of speech._] have done enough. He lays down in\r\nchap. ii. that man alone has intercourse by speech. Angels and animals\r\ndo not want it, for angels communicate intuitively; devils have no need\r\nof it;[550] to animals[551] it were useless: and if anybody urges the\r\nserpent in Paradise, Balaam’s ass, Ovid in the _Metamorphoses_ about\r\nmagpies, these objections can be met in various ways. The real power of\r\nspeech has been given to man alone. He needed it (chap. iii.) because he\r\nhas both reason and senses, and therefore must have some medium which\r\nwill convey the discourse of the former in a manner acceptable to the\r\nlatter. It is probable (chap. v.) that man spoke before woman, though\r\nthe earliest recorded speech is assigned to Eve: for man is more\r\nexcellent. And it is probable that the first word he spoke was “El,”\r\n“God,” and was addressed to God Himself in Paradise. No doubt (vi.) the\r\nlanguage was Hebrew. Foolish people may be driven (had Dante heard of\r\nthe Gaelic claim?) to believe that their own vernacular was that of\r\nAdam. But he knows better. Though he drank of Arno before his teeth\r\nappeared, and loves Florence so dearly that for the love he bore her is\r\nhe wrongfully suffering exile—though for the pleasure of his own senses\r\nthere exists no pleasanter place than Florence, yet he thinks that there\r\nare places in the world nobler and more delightful than Tuscany and\r\nFlorence, and that many nations and races may use a pleasanter and\r\nhandier speech. The consideration of the Flood, Babel, and the\r\nconsequent division of speech (chap, vii.) saddens him very much; but\r\nthe facts are indisputable.\r\n\r\nFootnote 550:\r\n\r\n  For the delightfully scholastic (and, like most scholastic things, by\r\n  no means inept) reasons, first, that as they set God at nought we need\r\n  take no count of them; secondly, that all they want to know of each\r\n  other, for their fiendish purposes, is their diabolic quality and\r\n  rank.\r\n\r\nFootnote 551:\r\n\r\n  As being solely guided by instinct.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that these chapters, coming as they do at the very\r\noutset, have, with hasty readers and thinkers, brought some discredit on\r\nthe book. They exhibit what it used to be, and still is to some extent,\r\nthe fashion to call the childish side of mediævalism and scholasticism.\r\nEvery age no doubt has its own childishnesses, and is profoundly\r\nconvinced that in holding them it has thoroughly put away childish\r\nthings. I do not myself know that, if it were possible to take a\r\nsimultaneous horizontal view of the ages, the nineteenth century would\r\nbe found so very much in advance of the thirteenth in this respect. But\r\nputting this aside as matter of separable controversy, we may observe\r\nthat, in the main body of his argument, Dante is merely arguing, and\r\narguing very sensibly and closely, from premisses which no one educated\r\nman in a thousand of his contemporaries would have disputed, and that at\r\nthe beginning and end there are very notable things. The notable thing\r\nat the beginning is the separation of “Grammar” and the “Vulgar Tongue,”\r\nand the, at that time, exceedingly bold ascription of greater “nobility”\r\nto the latter.[552] The notable thing at the end is the unexpectedly\r\ncosmopolitan character of Dante’s sentiments about the excellence of\r\nvarious countries and their vernaculars. It is true that, for good as\r\nwell as for evil, there was about Europe then a certain solidarity which\r\nhas entirely disappeared; but local, as distinct from national,\r\npatriotism was as strong, and occasionally as silly, as at any other\r\ntime. Dante’s own attitude puts us at once into a position for literary\r\ncriticism which neither Greek nor Roman had enjoyed—the Greek losing it\r\nby his arrogant assumption of a solitary literary position for his own\r\ntongue, and the Roman partly by his imitation of Greek, partly by the\r\nlurking desire to make out that Latin was not so very inferior after\r\nall.\r\n\r\nFootnote 552:\r\n\r\n  As to the apparent contradiction with the _Convito_, _v. infra_.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, in the chapter (viii.) which follows, there is no\r\ndeficiency in what we are pleased to call the scientific spirit;\r\n[Sidenote: _Division of contemporary tongues_.] on the contrary, any one\r\nwho knows the historical circumstances of the time can only be amazed at\r\nthe precision, the general justice, and, on the whole, the particular\r\nexactness with which Dante, in full Middle Age, surveys the languages of\r\nEurope. He is well aware of the threefold general division of\r\nlanguage—Teutonic-Slavonic, Turanian or Tartar, and Romance—and assigns\r\nthe boundaries quite correctly. He is further aware of the divisions of\r\nRomance speech itself, and as he had adopted as his criterion of\r\nTeutonic speech different forms of “yea” (“jo”) for the word of\r\naffirmation, so he uses the same criterion in this case. Of\r\nRomance-speaking nations he says, some say “oc,” some “oil,” and some\r\n“si.” The first are “Spaniards,” the second Frenchmen, the third\r\nItalians. The connection of “Spaniards” and “oc” need excite no\r\nsurprise. Castilian, though in existence, and already provided with the\r\nnoble _Poema del Cid_ and other documents, was as yet by no means the\r\ndominant language of Spain. In particular, Aragon and Catalonia, which\r\nspoke a Provençal dialect, had far more to do with Italy than Castile:\r\nGalicia, which all Europe visited in pilgrimage to the shrine of\r\nSantiago, also favoured the “oc,” and Provençal was actually later than\r\nthis the dialect of Portugal, if not of all Spain, for certain literary\r\npurposes. And the Spanish kingdom of Aragon was infinitely the most\r\nimportant country that spoke “oc.”\r\n\r\nProceeding, Dante illustrates the relationship of the three tongues by\r\nobserving that all call most important things (God, [Sidenote: _And of\r\nthe subdivisions of Romance._] heaven, earth, living, dying, loving—the\r\nselection is not negligible) by forms of the same Latin originals. In\r\nthe next chapter he continues the stress on this point, producing\r\nliterary and poetical quotations, from Provençal (Giraut de Borneil),\r\nFrench (Thibaut of Navarre), and Italian (Guido Guinicelli), of the word\r\n_Amor_; and points out—thus ever drawing nearer, in true methodic way,\r\nto his special subject—that the variations between the three great\r\nRomance speeches are produced, in each language, by dialectic\r\ndifferences. And he has, on the fact and on the consequent necessity of\r\nestablishing some common centrical form by Grammar[553], observations\r\nwhich lack neither truth nor sense. Then, Which is the best of the three\r\nRomance forms? He will not say, only timidly advancing for Italian that\r\n_si_ is nearest _sic_. Otherwise, each has strong claims. _Oil_ is not\r\nonly easier and pleasanter,[554] but whatever has been composed or\r\ntranslated in vernacular _prose_ belongs to it, the “most fair\r\nintricacies of Arthur,”[555] those of Trojans and Romans, &c. _Oc_ was\r\nfirst employed for poetry, being more finished and sweeter. Italian has\r\nthe sweetest and most refined poets[556] of all, and seems to be the\r\nclosest to “grammar.”[557]\r\n\r\nFootnote 553:\r\n\r\n  It is desirable to note that the original confusion, or, to speak more\r\n  correctly, ambiguity of “Grammar” is curiously illustrated in this\r\n  close context. Here the first “grammar” seems to denote literary as\r\n  opposed to vernacular tongue: the second can only mean Latin.\r\n\r\nFootnote 554:\r\n\r\n  _Facilior et delectabilior._\r\n\r\nFootnote 555:\r\n\r\n  _Arturi regis ambages pulcerrimæ._ This observation is not quite\r\n  negligible in the endless debate about the priority of verse or prose\r\n  in these legends.\r\n\r\nFootnote 556:\r\n\r\n  _Qui dulcius subtiliusque poetati vulgariter sunt._\r\n\r\nFootnote 557:\r\n\r\n  Cf. note opposite.\r\n\r\nHe will not, however, attempt _componere lites_[558], but consider the\r\nvariations, &c., of the Vulgar Tongue itself—_i.e._, Italian—though,\r\n[Sidenote: _The_ Italian Dialects: _Some rejected at once_.] as we shall\r\nsee, he does not hesitate to draw illustrations from the others. He\r\nfirst takes the Apennines as his language-watershed, and allowing\r\nfifteen main dialects, not a few of which are sub-divided, he proceeds\r\nto examine their claims, clearing away the bad ones. As the Romans think\r\nthey ought to have precedence[559] (note the crisp touch of life in\r\nthis), let us give it them—by kicking their claims out of the way at\r\nonce.[560] The _alma sdegnosa_ gives something more than a hint of\r\nitself in the description of Roman dialect as a “tristiloquy,” the\r\nugliest of all the vernacular dialects; which is no wonder, since they\r\nstink worst of all in the deformity of their customs and morals. The\r\nMarchers of Ancona and the Spoletans go next, each of the rejected ones\r\nhaving a scornful tag of his own barbarism tied to his tail, as Dante\r\nejects him from the competition. And he tells us, as if it settled the\r\nmatter (for, as we shall see, the Canzone is rather a fetish with\r\nDante), “many Canzoni have been written in contempt of them.” The\r\nMilanese, the Bergamasks, the Aquileans and Istrians follow, with all\r\nthe mountainous and country _patois_[561], and the Sardinians, who are\r\nnot Latins, though “to be joined with them,” and who only imitate Latin\r\nas apes do men. After this rapid sifting (he uses the metaphor) a new\r\nchapter is necessary.\r\n\r\nFootnote 558:\r\n\r\n  _Judicium relinquentes_ is his own phrase.\r\n\r\nFootnote 559:\r\n\r\n  _Se cunctis præponendos existimant._\r\n\r\nFootnote 560:\r\n\r\n  _In hac eradicatione, sive discerptione non immerito eos aliis\r\n  præponamus._\r\n\r\nFootnote 561:\r\n\r\n  _Montaninas et rusticanas loquelas._\r\n\r\nOf those “kept in the sieve” Sicilian claims the first place. Indeed\r\nDante acknowledges that “whatsoever the Italians poetise is called\r\nSicilian.” He admits this, but says it is merely [Sidenote:\r\n_Others—Sicilian, Apulian, Tuscan, and Genoese._] due to the fact that\r\nSicilian princes, or princes resident in Sicily, Frederick the Emperor\r\nand his son Manfred, have been patrons of literature, and have thus\r\nattached the best Italian genius to the Sicilian court. But he says\r\n(after an indignant digressory denunciation of contemporary sovereigns)\r\nthat there is no special value in the common Sicilian dialect, which\r\nindeed is seldom used for poetry at all, while of that which _is_ used,\r\nmore to follow. As for the Apulians, there have been some good writers\r\namong them, but their ordinary speech is spoilt with barbarisms.[562]\r\n\r\nBut what of the Tuscans? Dante can only repeat that cosmopolitan\r\ncriticism, which, though it would be very illiberal to impute it wholly\r\nto his exile, was no doubt assisted thereby. They may madly assert their\r\ntitle to the possession of the Illustrious Vulgar Tongue, and even some\r\ndistinguished men may have condescended to the Tuscan vernacular. But\r\nlet us examine them town by town. Florence, Pisa, Lucca, Siena, Arezzo\r\nare hit off each in a sentence expressing its boast, and, we may\r\nsuppose, expressing it with some provincialism. But Dante says, when men\r\nreally to be admired, Guido, Lapo, and “another”[563] of Florence, and\r\nCino da Pistoia, have written, it is in “curial,” not in the vulgar\r\nTuscan tongue.\r\n\r\nFootnote 562:\r\n\r\n  _Turpiter barbarizant._\r\n\r\nFootnote 563:\r\n\r\n  _Guidonem, Lapum et unum alium Florentinos._ It is needless to say who\r\n  is _unus alius_.\r\n\r\nAs for the Genoese, the annihilation of the letter Z would strike them\r\ndumb, for they can say nothing without it.\r\n\r\nThen he crosses the Apennines[564] and decides successively that\r\nRomagnese, in its various divisions, and Venetian, are full of\r\n[Sidenote: _Venetian: Some good in Bolognese._] drawbacks and\r\nvulgarities.[565] After which a whole chapter (xv.) is given to the\r\ndialect of Bologna. It is perhaps better than any other and why? Because\r\nit borrows the best things _from_ the others, as, for instance, Sordello\r\nthe Mantuan borrowed from Cremona, Brescia, and Verona. On the other\r\nhand, Ferrara, Modena, and Reggio are too Lombardic, and though they\r\nhave lent a touch of piquancy to Bolognese, cannot create a good\r\nliterary dialect for themselves. Still Bolognese, though better than\r\nother individual dialects, because more composite, is not the\r\nIllustrious Vulgar Tongue, for otherwise Guido Guinicelli and other\r\ngreat Bolognese poets would not have departed from it. So down with the\r\nsieve for, as for places like Trent and Turin, they are too near the\r\nfrontier, and if they were _pulcherrima_ as they are _turpissima_ they\r\nwould not be _vere Latinum_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 564:\r\n\r\n  _Frondiferos humeros Apennini_—a more affectionate if less picturesque\r\n  touch than Mr Ruskin’s “angry Apennine” and Mr Browning’s “wind-swept\r\n  gash” thereof.\r\n\r\nFootnote 565:\r\n\r\n  Hildebrand of Padua is excepted, as _Nitentem divertere a materno et\r\n  ad curiale vulgare intendere_. Two sonnets of his are said to be now\r\n  extant.\r\n\r\nHaving thus for fifteen chapters pursued a sort of “Rule of False” in\r\norder to catch that panther[566], the Illustrious Vulgar [Sidenote: _The\r\n“Illustrious” Language none of these, but their common measure._]\r\nTongue, by the _a posteriori_ method, Dante determines to track her _a\r\npriori_. He calls Logic to his aid, and observes that every individual,\r\nspecies, genus is subject to a common measure. The measure of individual\r\nconduct is Virtue; of conduct between man and man, Law; in public\r\nbehaviour, national manners and customs. So too there must be some norm,\r\nsome common measure of all Italian tongues and dialects, and this,\r\nperceptible in all, abiding in none, will be what is sought for. This is\r\nthe—\r\n\r\n          1. Illustre.\r\n          2. Cardinale.\r\n          3. Aulicum; et\r\n          4. Curiale vulgare in Latio.\r\n\r\nEach of these epithets has then to be discussed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 566:\r\n\r\n  This beast is of course not here referred to, as in the well-known\r\n  passage at the beginning of the _Inferno_, as a type of vice, but, as\r\n  in _Inf._, xvi. 106, as a desirable prey. The beauty of the panther’s\r\n  skin, the sweet breath fabulously attributed to it, and so forth,\r\n  sometimes gave it a wholly favourable place in mediæval fantasy, as in\r\n  one of the prettiest fragments of Anglo-Saxon verse, the “Panther” of\r\n  the Exeter Book, where it is a type of Christ.\r\n\r\nSo we have the substance, the underlying and fashioning unity, of\r\nItalian defined as a tongue possessing a quadripartite [Sidenote: _Its\r\nfour characteristics._] differentia, and so it becomes necessary to\r\nexplain the four parts. _Illustrious_, as the seventeenth chapter,\r\ndevoted to it, explains, is something that “shines forth,” _illuminans\r\net illuminatum_. Men are so called who, having been well trained, are\r\ngreat trainers, like Numa Pompilius and Seneca. This is what the\r\nIllustrious Vulgar Tongue of Italy is. It has cleared off much rubbish,\r\nas in Cino da Pistoia. It attracts even the unwilling. It exalts those\r\nwho practise it. They surpass kings, marquises, counts. It gives a glory\r\nwhich even we, exiles as we are, acknowledge as sweetening the\r\nbitterness of our exile. Therefore it is Illustrious.\r\n\r\nThe three other epithets enjoy but a chapter between them. It is\r\n_Cardinal_, for as a door turns on a hinge, so all the throng of\r\ndialects turns on it. It is _Aulic_, because, if we Italians had a\r\nCourt, it would be spoken there, and because, as a matter of fact, all\r\nthose who enjoy courtly frequentation speak it. It is _Curial_ because,\r\nthough as in the Aulic case the conditions are wanting, it would be\r\nspoken in the great Law Courts of Italy if they existed, and it presents\r\nthe action of a great Court of Law in trying and sifting cases. This is\r\nthe proper Italian language, common to all, aimed at (if unconsciously)\r\nby all, giving the real key to all.\r\n\r\nAnd so the first book ends, with the establishment on logical bases\r\n(none the weaker because the struts and props of them are sometimes\r\ndecorated with a bygone ornamentation) at once of the necessity and the\r\nfact of a literary language for Italy, a language combining the merits,\r\nand purified from the defects, of the various local kinds of speech.\r\n\r\nThe First Book of the _De Vulgari Eloquio_ has been chiefly concerned\r\nwith language, though—as it is of the very highest [Sidenote: _The\r\nSecond Book—Why Dante deals with poetry only._] importance to\r\nobserve—always with a side-glance at literature. The Second passes to\r\nliterature itself, at least to that part of literature which was almost\r\nthe only serious part to the earlier Middle Ages—namely, poetry. If we\r\nwanted anything to show us what a man of letters Dante was, it would be\r\nfound in the apology which he makes at the beginning of this book for\r\nnot dealing with Rhetoric at large, but only with Poetic. It is simply\r\nthat “prosaicants” usually get their language from “inventors,” and\r\n“invention” remains a solid example to them, not _vice versa_. This,\r\nperhaps, with some exceptions (the chief among them he has himself\r\nreferred to in citing the French Arthurian legend), was true in his\r\ntime, though it was ceasing to be true; and a certain amount of truth\r\nremains still, greatly as the circumstances have changed. There is, he\r\ngoes on to say, a kind of primacy about verse; so let us deal with it\r\n_secundum quod metricum est_.\r\n\r\nNow, ought writers in verse to write _vulgariter_? Yes, he thought. The\r\nbest things require the best language, and that, [Sidenote: _All good\r\npoetry should be in the Illustrious._] as we have seen, is the\r\nIllustrious Vernacular. Things not so good will be improved by the best\r\nexpression. So all verse-writers should use it, at least at first sight,\r\nthough we must alter this conception on further thought. The Illustrious\r\nlanguage demands illustrious writers (_alma sdegnosa_ again!), and not\r\nonly that, but the best thoughts or subjects. Very inferior persons\r\nwriting on very inferior subjects had better _not_ use the Illustrious,\r\nfor an ugly woman never looks uglier than when dressed in gold and silk.\r\n\r\nNow what subjects are good enough for the Illustrious Vernacular? Only\r\nThree: _Salus_, _Venus_, _Virtus_—in other words, [Sidenote: _The\r\nsubjects of High Poetry—War, Love, Virtue._] War, Love, and Moral\r\nBeauty, which means philosophy _plus_ religion. Dante reaches this\r\nconclusion in the queer-looking but perhaps not easily improvable manner\r\nusual with him, by the _prior_ and the _posterior_ roads alike. These\r\nsubjects are, first, the three things of most importance to a\r\nVegetable-Animal-Rational-creature like man, and they are also those\r\ndiscussed by the best writers in the Vulgar Tongue, Bertran de Born,\r\nArnaut Daniel, Cino da Pistoia, &c. But he does not find that any\r\nItalian has written on the subject of _Salus_ or Arms. (An ominous\r\nfact!)\r\n\r\nSo much for subject; now for form. What forms are there of Illustrious\r\nVulgar Verse? Some have written Canzoni, some [Sidenote: _Its form:\r\nCanzoni._] Ballades, some Sonnets, some other and irregular forms. The\r\nbest of these are Canzoni, for a wilderness of reasons, good, not very\r\ngood, indifferent, and bad, the strongest of which, though not\r\nexpressed, evidently is that Dante likes Canzoni best and knows he\r\nwrites them well. They unite, he says, all the best points of art; the\r\nworks of the best poets are found in them. So let us write of Canzoni,\r\nputting off Ballades, &c., to the Fourth Book—which, alas! we have not.\r\n\r\nWhat is Poetry? It is _fictio rhetorica in musica posita_. [Sidenote:\r\n_Definition of Poetry._] This is so important that no passing criticism\r\nof it will do, and we must postpone the discussion.\r\n\r\nBut here comes in the curious mediæval humility which made a poet like\r\nDante regard himself as inferior to Ovid, and [Sidenote: _Its styles and\r\nthe constituents of the grand style._] Lucan, and Statius. Our poets\r\ndiffer from the “great” poets, the “regular” ones; but they ought to\r\napproach them as nearly as possible, and, as _Magister noster Horatius_\r\nteaches, take a suitable subject. And then they must decide what style\r\nto write in. If in the Tragic or Higher style, the Illustrious\r\nVernacular will be suitable; if in the comic, a mixed or intermediate\r\nstyle; if in Elegy, the lower. But these two latter are again relegated\r\nto the lost, or never written, Fourth Book. Canzoni must be written in\r\nthe Tragic style, and the Illustrious Vulgar Tongue. This is to be\r\nattained when, with the gravity of the meaning, not merely the pride of\r\nthe verse, but the loftiness of the phrasing and the excellence of the\r\nwords, agrees. It is no light matter to compose in this way; the most\r\nstrenuous efforts are necessary. And, therefore, let the folly of those\r\nbe confessed who, guiltless of art and science, and trusting to their\r\nwits alone, break out into the highest song on the highest subjects.\r\n\r\nSo the considerations are marked out, the Gravitas Sententiæ having been\r\nalready distributed between War, Love, and Virtue.\r\n\r\n      1. Superbia Carminum.\r\n      2. Constructionis elatio.\r\n      3. Excellentia vocabulorum.\r\n\r\nBeginning with metric, Dante, like a sensible man, confines himself here\r\nto the teachings of experience, eschewing all [Sidenote: Superbia\r\nCarminum.] argument in the vague. What lines have actually given the\r\nbest results in the Illustrious Vernacular? He looks them over, and\r\nfinds that lines have varied from three syllables to eleven, that those\r\nof five, seven, and eleven are best of all, and that that of eleven (in\r\nwhich he rightly includes the French decasyllable with its weak ending)\r\nis the best of these best. Seven comes next; then five, then three. Nine\r\nis not good, because divisible into three threes. Even lines are “rude,”\r\nby which he means (as is undoubtedly true) that they do not suit the\r\nstructure of Italian. The hendecasyllable is that _superbissimum carmen_\r\nthat we sought.\r\n\r\nNext for the phrase or construction. Here Dante becomes a little\r\ndifficult, chiefly because he uses peculiar words, which have [Sidenote:\r\nConstructionis elatio.] not been always judiciously translated. He says\r\nthat there is first the “insipid” style, that without flavour (_sapor_)\r\nor individual character, which merely states a fact, his example being\r\n_Petrus amat multum dominam Bertam_.\r\n\r\nNext there is the purely “sapid” or tasteful, described oddly as that of\r\n“rigid scholars or masters”; the _sapidus et venustus_, which is of\r\nthose who have drunk superficial draughts of rhetoric; and the sapid,\r\nvenust, and also lofty, which is the best of all. The examples of these\r\nshall be given below[567], but they are hard to follow in detail, though\r\nthe classes are clear enough, corresponding to (1) sheer prose, (2)\r\nefforts at style, (3) ornate prose without much distinction, (4) style\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\nFootnote 567:\r\n\r\n  Sapid pure: _Piget me cunctis, sed pietatem majorem illorum habeo,\r\n  quicunque in exilio tabescentes, patriam tantum somniando revisunt_.\r\n\r\n  Sapid and venust: _Laudabilis discretio Marchionis Estensis et sua\r\n  magnificentia præparata cunctis illum facit esse dilectum_.\r\n\r\n  Sapid, venust, and excelse: _Ejecta maxima parte florum de sinu tuo,\r\n  Florentia, nequicquam Trinacriam Totila serus adivit_.\r\n\r\nThis last, of course, is what the poet must aim at, and again examples\r\nof hitting it are given. But the chapter ends with a valuable catalogue\r\nof the “great,” the “regular” poets: Virgil, Ovid in the\r\n_Metamorphoses_, Statius, and Lucan, with, in prose, Cicero, Livy,\r\nPliny, Frontinus, and (O ye groves of Blarney!) Paulus Orosius. Let\r\npeople read these, and not talk about Guido of Arezzo.\r\n\r\nLastly the words.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Excellentia Verborum.]\r\n\r\nHere the subdivision is again of great importance and some difficulty.\r\nDante distinguishes a sort of tree—\r\n\r\n           Puerilia ── Muliebria ── Virilia.\r\n                                       │\r\n                           ┌───────────┴───────────┐\r\n                           │                       │\r\n                       Silvestria.               Urbana.\r\n                                                   │\r\n                   ┌───────────────────────────────┤\r\n                   │                               │\r\n           Pexa et hirsuta.               Lubrica et reburra.\r\n\r\nAll these words (save perhaps _reburra_, which, however, a remembrance\r\nof the French _à rebours_ will clear up at once) are easy to understand,\r\nif sometimes rather hard of application.\r\n\r\nNow, according to Dante, _Pexa et Hirsuta_ are _grandiosa_, while\r\n_lubrica et reburra in superfluum sonant_. And it will be most specially\r\nimportant to use the “sieve,” for, looking to the poets who have\r\nsucceeded in the Illustrious Vernacular, _sola vocabula nobilissima_ are\r\nto be left therein. “Childish”[568] words must be left out altogether:\r\n“feminine”[569] words are too soft, “silvan”[570] words too rough, nor\r\nwill _lubrica_ nor _reburra_[571], though _urbana_, do. So _pexa_[572]\r\n_et hirsuta_[573] alone are left.\r\n\r\nFootnote 568:\r\n\r\n  As _mamma_ and _babbo_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 569:\r\n\r\n  As _dolciada_ and _piacevole_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 570:\r\n\r\n  As _gregia_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 571:\r\n\r\n  As _femina_ and _corpo_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 572:\r\n\r\n  As _amore_, _donna_, _virtute_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 573:\r\n\r\n  As _terra_, _onore_, _speranza_, _gravitate_, and on to\r\n  _sovramagnificentissimamente_.\r\n\r\nAll this terminology is, of course, more than a little obscure, and the\r\nexplanation of the obscurities rather concerns a commentator [Sidenote:\r\nPexa et hirsuta.] on Dante than a historian of literary criticism. But\r\nthe explanation, given by the critic-poet himself, of _pexa et hirsuta_\r\ndoes concern us, and is interesting. The former, it seems, are words\r\nwhich are trisyllabic, or “neighbours to trisyllabity,” without an\r\naspirate, without an acute or circumflexed accent, without double _x_’s\r\nor _z_’s, without the conjunction of two liquids, or the placing of them\r\nafter a mute, which freedoms give a certain sweetness. _Hirsuta_, on the\r\nother hand, are all others which, like the monosyllabic pronouns and\r\narticles, cannot be dispensed with, or which, though the above\r\nuglinesses have not been “combed out” of them, still, when mixed with\r\ncombed-out words, are ornamental. He includes in this last class\r\n_sovramagnificentissimamente_, a hendecasyllabic in itself. He would not\r\neven mind _onorificabilitudinitate_, which has thirteen syllables in two\r\nof its Latin cases, if it were not by its length excluded from Italian\r\nverse.\r\n\r\nSo having got the sticks of words for our faggot the canzone, and the\r\ncords of construction and classification to bind them [Sidenote: _The\r\nCanzone._] up[574], let us set to work to the actual binding and\r\nfaggoting, before which something more must be said about the faggot\r\nitself, the Canzone. The Canzone (_cantio_) is the action or passion of\r\nsinging, just as a “reading” or book (_lectio_) is the action or passion\r\nof reading. A little metaphysic follows on _actio_ and _passio_, and the\r\nfact that the _cantio_ is _actio_ when composed, _passio_ when sung or\r\nacted. But is the _cantio_ the words or the tune? Surely the words;\r\nnobody calls the tune _canzone_. In fact, all words written for music\r\nmay in a sense be called _canzoni_, even ballads, even sonnets, even\r\npoems in Latin (_regulariter_). But _we_ are speaking of the supreme\r\ncanzone, like Dante’s _Donne ch’ avete_. It is “a tragic composition” of\r\nequal stanzas, without _responsorium_ (dialogue or antiphon). The last\r\nsix chapters concern us less, because they are wholly occupied with the\r\nparticular rhyming, lining, and stanza-fashion of the canzone itself,\r\nand, interesting as they are, overflow our limits, except as a\r\nparticular example of the general kind of criticism which has been so\r\nlaboriously built up.\r\n\r\nFootnote 574:\r\n\r\n  _Fustibus et torquibus ad fascem._\r\n\r\nWith the conclusion of this the tractate stops abruptly, nor have we any\r\nindication of what the Third Book was to consist of, though the Fourth,\r\nas we have seen above, is more than once referred to. The loss of both\r\nmust be regarded as one of the most serious that the history of\r\ncriticism has suffered.\r\n\r\nYet the possession of what we have is no mean consolation, and I must be\r\nexcused for repeating an expression of the [Sidenote: _Importance of the\r\nbook._] extremest surprise at the comparatively small attention which\r\nthe book has received, and at the slighting fashion in which it has been\r\ntreated by some of those who have paid attention to it. For myself, I am\r\nprepared to claim for it, not merely the position of the most important\r\ncritical document between Longinus and the seventeenth century at least,\r\nbut one of intrinsic importance on a line with that of the very greatest\r\ncritical documents of all history. There is no need at all to lay much\r\nstress on the mere external attractiveness, unusual as that may be, of\r\nthe combination in one person of the greatest poet and the first, if not\r\nthe sole, great critic of the Middle Ages. The tub can stand on its own\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it only requires acquaintance with that previous\r\nhistory of the subject, which we have here endeavoured to unfold, to see\r\nthat we have the inestimable advantage of a quite new and independent\r\ntreatment of that subject. There is [Sidenote: _Independence and novelty\r\nof its method._] no direct evidence that Dante knew the _Poetics_[575]:\r\nwe see that he cites Horace and cites him _magnificentissime_. But the\r\nEpistle to the Pisos might never have been written, for any sign there\r\nis of direct influence from it on Dante’s method. So, too, singular as\r\nis the resemblance between the spirit of him and the spirit of Longinus;\r\nremarkable as is the coincidence between the words of both about words;\r\nand possible as the John of Sicily[576] reference makes it that Dante\r\nmight have known the Great Unknown of Criticism—yet there is not the\r\nfaintest evidence that he _did_ know him, and an almost overwhelming\r\nprobability that he did not. To the method of no classical predecessor\r\nin pure criticism does his method bear the smallest resemblance, even if\r\nfaint resemblances might be pointed out in phrase.\r\n\r\nBut it is still more remarkable that, steeped to the lips as he is in\r\nscholastic lore—though _trivium_ and _quadrivium_ must have been at his\r\nfingers’ ends—the _De Vulgari Eloquio_, even in mentioning Rhetoric\r\nitself, shows not the faintest tincture of that scholastic rhetoric\r\nwhich we have noticed. There is not so much as an allusion to the\r\nFigures: they have been, for Dante on this occasion, as completely\r\nbanished from _rerum natura_ as poor Albucius feared they would be, if\r\nhis judges disallowed his pleading.[577] The familiar Arts of\r\nComposition make no appearance: Beginning, Middle, and End are with the\r\nFigures. If we did not know that these things must have been as familiar\r\nto Dante as the alphabet or the multiplication-table to any modern\r\nchild, we might think, from this treatise, that he had never heard of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFootnote 575:\r\n\r\n  It is thought that Petrarch may have known the German\r\n  thirteenth-century version in Latin.\r\n\r\nFootnote 576:\r\n\r\n  _V. supra_, p. 187.\r\n\r\nFootnote 577:\r\n\r\n  _V. supra_, p. 238.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, indeed, without too much guess-work, that, despite his\r\nattempts to assimilate writing _vulgariter et regulariter_, Dante had an\r\nunconscious and an infinitely salutary instinct, telling him that\r\n_regulariter_ and _vulgariter_ were _not_ the same thing. He may have\r\nsometimes thought that the former was the nobler; even in his disdainful\r\nsoul, the touching humility of the Middle Ages existed, as we know, to\r\nsuch an extent that he could put Virgil, who may be worthy to unloose\r\nhis shoe-latchet, in a position above himself. But something must have\r\nwarned him to keep the two apart, to approach the criticism of the\r\nillustrious Vernacular literature by a path _nullius ante trita solo_.\r\n\r\nThat path, as has been pointed out, is in fact a double approach: we\r\nmight almost say that the restless manymindedness [Sidenote: _Dante’s\r\nattention to Form._] of Dante attacks the hill on half-a-dozen different\r\nsides at once. We have a chain of mainly _a priori_ argument, reaching\r\nfrom the origin and nature of language to the completely built and\r\nfitted-out _canzone_. We have careful surveys of existing language and\r\nliterature, with the keenest observation bent upon what is the actual\r\nstate of each, on what each has actually achieved. But besides these two\r\nways of approach, neither of which is at all like those of the ancient\r\ncritics, there is a third difference which is more striking still: and\r\nthat is that the critic’s attention is evidently from the first fixed,\r\nnot exclusively, but, from the point of view of his business, mainly, on\r\nquestions of form, expression, result, rather than on questions of\r\nmatter, conception, plan. Not exclusively—let that be emphatically\r\nrepeated: but still mainly.\r\n\r\nAgain we see, incidentally, but none the less to an important effect,\r\nthat he has, no doubt by the mere operation of the lapse [Sidenote: _His\r\ndisregard of Oratory._] of ages in part, in part by the activity of his\r\nown intellect, and the character of the matter presented to it, got rid\r\nof divers prejudices which weighed upon the ancients. It is not a just\r\nretort, when it is said that he has completely got rid of the oratorical\r\npreoccupation, to say that he is only dealing with Poetics. For the\r\nancients themselves this preoccupation was constant, even when they\r\ndealt with Poetics; and Dante does, as a matter of fact, make references\r\nto prose which show that he did not dream (as how indeed should he?) of\r\noratory having any pre-eminence. And at the same time that the fruitful\r\nmodern literatures helped him to get rid of this, the greatest drawback\r\nor interfering flaw of ancient criticism, they helped him to get rid of\r\nanother, the ignorance of prose fiction. True, he may in his quaint low\r\nLatin use _inventor_ for _poeta_; but the simple reference to the prose\r\nArthurian, Trojan, and Roman legends shows that the gap, which led\r\nAristotle and all the rest astray, had been filled up.\r\n\r\nYet again, the character of the Romance poetry which he chiefly had\r\nbefore him, as well as (if he knew anything of them, [Sidenote: _The\r\ninfluence on him of Romance._] which is quite possible) that of the\r\nGerman _minnesingers_, was such as to require positively, from any\r\nvigorous and subtle intellect, a quite different treatment from that\r\nappropriate to most ancient poetry. The war-songs might stand on no very\r\ndifferent footing; but, as he admits, there were no war-songs in\r\nItalian. The mystical passion and the mystical religion of the other two\r\ndivisions are like nothing in ancient poetry, except scraps and flashes\r\nof things which must have been mostly unknown to Dante,—the choruses of\r\nthe Greek Poets, Catullus, Lucretius, and some things in the Greek\r\nAnthology. There was in most cases no action at all; the subject, though\r\nvarying and twisting in facet and form, like a mountain mist, was always\r\nmore or less the same; the expression of the poet’s passionate intense\r\nindividual feeling and thought was all, and of this no _general_\r\ncriticism was possible. The forms, on the other hand, the language, the\r\narrangements, these were matters of intense, novel, and pressing\r\ninterest. The ancient critic, at the very earliest date at which we have\r\nany utterances of his _in extenso_, had a sort of catholic faith already\r\nprovided for him on these points. Tragedy, Comedy, Oratory, History,\r\nLyric, &c., were established forms. Rhetoric, though interesting, was\r\nalmost as scientific as arithmetic or geometry. As for language, you\r\nimitated the best models, and did not play personal tricks. Besides, it\r\nwas quite a minor matter.\r\n\r\nLastly, we see that (again half, or more than half, unconsciously and\r\ninstinctively) Dante has been brought by the \"forward [Sidenote: _And of\r\ncomparative criticism._] flowing tide of time\" to a more advanced\r\nposition in respect of comparative criticism. No ancient critic could\r\nhave made such a survey as he makes of the different languages of\r\nEurope; no ancient critic did make such a survey of the dialects of\r\nGreek as he makes of the dialects of Italian. That curious spirit of\r\nroutine which (valuable as it was in the time and in the circumstances)\r\nmars ancient literature to some extent, shows itself nowhere more oddly\r\nthan here. You used Æolic dialect for lyric poetry, because Sappho and\r\nAlcæus were Æolians; Doric for pastorals, because Theocritus and the\r\nothers were Dorians. You might use Ionic in history because Herodotus\r\nwas a Halicarnassian; and Homer preserved a special dialect for you in\r\nepic likewise. But otherwise you wrote in Attic, not because Attic was\r\nthe Illustrious Vulgar Tongue of Greece (as it very nearly if not quite\r\nwas), but because an enormous proportion of the best writers in most\r\ndepartments were Athenians. So in Latin you might—almost must—use loose\r\nverse, and familiar or abstruse phrase, in satire, but not elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOf this there is no trace in Dante, though he may allot his Illustrious\r\ntongue to one kind, his Intermediate and Lower to others. He may indeed\r\ncite, as a subsidiary argument, the fact that such and such a one has\r\nused such and such a dialect or form, but it is only subsidiary. He is,\r\nin effect, looking about to see, partly how the reason of things will\r\ngo, partly what has actually had the best effect. He, groping dimly in\r\nthe benighted, the shackled Middle Ages, actually attains to a freer and\r\nmore enlightened kind of criticism than the Greeks, with all their “play\r\nof mind,” all their “lucidity,” had reached.\r\n\r\nAnd his bent towards formal criticism—towards those considerations of\r\nprosody, of harmony, of vocabulary, of structure, which, when they are\r\nconsidered to-day, even now send some critics into (as the poet says)\r\n\r\n                       “A beastly froth of rage”\r\n\r\nagainst those who so consider them—is all the more important, because\r\nnot the most impudent accuser of the brethren can [Sidenote: _The\r\npoetical differentia according to him._] bring against Dante the charge\r\nof being a mere formalist, of being indifferent to meaning, of having no\r\n“criticism of life” in him, of lacking “high seriousness,” attention to\r\nconduct, care for meaning and substance. On the contrary, there is not a\r\npoet in the whole vast range of poetry, not the Greek tragedians at\r\ntheir gravest and highest chorus-pitch, not Lucretius in his fervour of\r\nIdealist Materialism, not Shakespeare in the profoundest moments of\r\nMacbeth, or Prospero, or Hamlet, not Milton, not Wordsworth, who is more\r\npassionately ideal, “thoughtful,” penetrated and intoxicated with the\r\n“subject,” than Dante is. But he, thanks very mainly to the logical\r\ntraining of the despised scholasticism, thanks partly to the mere\r\nprogress of time, the refreshing of the human mind after its season of\r\nsleep—most of all no doubt to his own intense and magnificent poetical\r\ngenius—had completely separated and recognised the differentia of\r\npoetry, its presentation of the subject in metrical form with musical\r\naccompaniment, whether of word or of actual music.[578] He knows—he\r\nactually says in effect—that prosemen may have the treatment of the same\r\nsubjects; but he knows that the poet’s treatment is different, and he\r\ngoes straight for the difference.\r\n\r\nFootnote 578:\r\n\r\n  Some have assumed that Dante thinks all high poetry must be “set” in\r\n  the common sense. He does not say so, and every consideration is\r\n  against it. The “rhetorical fiction set in music” is obviously the\r\n  opposition of poetry to _prose_, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nAnd where does he find it? Exactly where Wordsworth five hundred years\r\nlater refused to find it, in Poetic Diction and [Sidenote: _His antidote\r\nto the Wordsworthian heresy._] in Metre. The contrast of the _De Vulgari\r\nEloquio_ and of the _Preface_ to _Lyrical Ballads_ is so remarkable that\r\nit may be doubted whether there is any more remarkable thing of the kind\r\nin literature. Whether Wordsworth was acquainted with the treatise it is\r\nimpossible to say. (Coleridge certainly knew of it, though it is not\r\nquite clear whether he had read it.) But it is improbable, for\r\nWordsworth was not a wide reader. And, moreover, though in tendency the\r\ntwo tractates are diametrically opposed, he nowhere answers Dante; but,\r\non the contrary, is answered by Dante, with an almost uncanny\r\nanticipation of the privilege of the last word, in a word five hundred\r\nyears earlier.\r\n\r\nWe shall have to return to this matter in dealing with Wordsworth\r\nhimself. But for the present let us confine ourselves to Dante.\r\n\r\nThe details of his metrical part need the lesser notice because they are\r\nof the more limited and particular application. [Sidenote: _His handling\r\nof metre._] Had Dante completed his book, it would still have had the\r\nlimitation of dealing solely with Romance, if not exclusively with\r\nItalian, poetry. And with particular episodes we shall only meddle when\r\nthey are closely connected with general critical quarrels. But his\r\nmethod is worth a word or two, because it is again, precisely, that\r\napparently loose but really unerring mixture of general reasoning and\r\nparticular observation which the critic requires, which prevents him\r\nfrom being ever exactly scientific, but which gives to his craft the\r\ndignity, the difficulty, the versatile charm of art. His recognition of\r\nthe hendecasyllable, not merely as the line preferred by the best\r\nwriters in Italian, but as the longest line really manageable in\r\nItalian, would be sufficient proof of this.\r\n\r\nBut he is considerably more interesting on diction, because here his\r\nobservations (_mutatis mutandis_, and that in extremely [Sidenote: _Of\r\ndiction._] few cases and unimportant measure) are of universal\r\napplication. The theory of Poetic Diction, the twin pillar of the temple\r\nof Poetry, had been put by Longinus in one flashing axiom, true, sound,\r\nilluminative for ever and ever. But he had not elaborated this; he had\r\neven, in some cases, as in his remarks on the Εἰς ἐρωμέναν, given\r\noccasion to those who blaspheme the doctrine. Dante, with no such single\r\nphrase (which indeed the odd mongrel speech he uses denied him),\r\nexpresses the doctrine far more fully, elaborates it, establishes it\r\nsoundly, and, moreover, is never in the very least inconsistent with\r\nhimself about it. Even Aristotle himself would have joined no direct\r\nissue with the quadripartite division of the necessities of serious\r\npoetry as _gravitas sententiæ_ and _superbia carminum_, _constructionis\r\nelatio_ and _excellentia verborum_; but he would have given the first\r\npreponderance over all the others, and would have laid descending stress\r\non the rest. It may almost be said that Dante exactly reverses the\r\norder. The _gravitas sententiæ_ is not denied, but assumed as a thing of\r\ncourse, common to all good matter in verse and prose alike. The\r\n_superbia carminum_ is a matter of investigation; but when you have got\r\nyour form of _cantio_, &c., settled, that _is_ settled. It is upon the\r\nthird and the fourth, which are, briefly, Style and Diction, that he\r\nbends his whole strength, and that he exhibits his most novel, most\r\nimportant, most eternally valid criticism.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the examples, both Latin and Italian, produced in\r\nthe chapter on Style (that is to say, the construction [Sidenote: _His\r\nstandards of style._] or arrangement of selected phrase as opposed to\r\nselection of the component words) are not free from difficulty. But if\r\nwe examine them all carefully together, something will emerge from the\r\ncomparison. In the four Latin sentences[579] (for translations here are\r\ntotally useless) we observe that the first[580] is a mere statement of\r\nfact, possessing, indeed, that complete expression of the meaning which\r\nColeridge so oddly postulates as the differentia of style, but\r\npossessing nothing more—nourishing, in short, but not “sapid.” The\r\nnext[581] is carefully (“tastefully”) arranged according to the\r\nscholastic rules—verb at the end, important words at end or beginning of\r\nclause, &c., but nothing more. The charm (_venustas_) of the third[582]\r\nis more difficult to identify; but it would seem to consist in a sort of\r\nsuperficially rhetorical declamation. But there is no difficulty in\r\ndiscovering in what the fourth sentence[583] differs from the rest.\r\nThere is the conceit of the “casting out of the flowers” with the\r\ninterwoven play of _florum_ and _Florentia_, the apostrophe to the town,\r\nthe double alliteration of _florum_, _Florentia_, _Trinacriam_,\r\n_Totila_, with the reverse order of length in the words, and their vowel\r\narrangement. And in almost all the verse vernacular examples, though it\r\nmay not always be easy to discern their exact attraction for Dante, we\r\nshall find the same alliteration—\r\n\r\n             “Sols sui qui sai lo sobrafan, que me sortz;”\r\n\r\nthe same vowel-music—\r\n\r\n                  “Dreit Amor qu’ en mon cor repaire;”\r\n\r\nor a combination of this music with careful mounting and falling rhythm,\r\nas in\r\n\r\n                “Si com l’ arbres, que per sobrecarcar.”\r\n\r\nIn other words, we shall find, in all, devices for making the common\r\nuncommon, for giving the poetic strangeness, unexpectedness, charm,—by\r\nmere arrangement, by arrangement _plus_ music, and so forth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 579:\r\n\r\n  _V. supra_, p. 429, and note.\r\n\r\nFootnote 580:\r\n\r\n  _Petrus amat_, &c.\r\n\r\nFootnote 581:\r\n\r\n  _Piget me cunctis_, &c.\r\n\r\nFootnote 582:\r\n\r\n  _Laudabilis discretio_, &c.\r\n\r\nFootnote 583:\r\n\r\n  _Ejecta maxima_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe contempt of style as something “vulgar,” which had beset all\r\nantiquity (save always Longinus), would have alone prevented the\r\nancients from criticising in this way, even if the lack of various\r\nlanguage had not done so.\r\n\r\nAnd so we find, on the threshold, or hardly even on the threshold, of\r\nwhat is commonly called modern literature, an anticipation, and more\r\nthan an anticipation, of what is really modern criticism. Of course this\r\nis a disputable even more than a disputed statement. Of course there are\r\nmany respectable authorities who will not hear of it, who will accuse\r\nthose who make it of mere will-worship, perhaps even of gross error, for\r\nassuming any such thing. Yet it may be said in all humility, but after a\r\nvery considerable number of years of study of a subject to which little\r\ngeneral attention has been given, that there _is_ this difference\r\nbetween ancient and modern criticism, and that it appears in the _De\r\nVulgari Eloquio_. I shall be content, I shall even be much obliged, if\r\nany one will point out to me, in the authors who have been hitherto\r\nconsidered, or in any who may have been overlooked, a passage like this.\r\nI can only say that, in my reading, I have found none.\r\n\r\nBut the chapter of words—the Chapter of the Sieve, as we may call it—is\r\nthat which contains the real heart and kernel [Sidenote: _The \"Chapter\r\nof the Sieve.\"_] of Dante’s criticism. For, dwell as much as he may on\r\nthe importance of arrangement and phrase, it is impossible that these\r\nshould be beautiful without beautiful words to make them of. And his\r\nsystem of “sifting,” quaint as its phraseology may seem at first sight,\r\narbitrary as some of its divisions may appear, and here and there\r\ndifficult as it may be exactly to follow him, is a perfectly sound\r\nscheme, and only requires working out at greater length. The objection\r\nto _puerilia_, though it may be too sweepingly expressed, is absolutely\r\njust, and cuts away Wordsworth’s childishnesses by anticipation. That to\r\n“effeminate” words, “silvan” words, words too “slippery” and too much\r\n“brushed the wrong way,” is, in its actual form, perhaps somewhat too\r\nclosely connected with the peculiarities of the Italian language. We can\r\nunderstand that the snarling sound of the _r_ in _gregia_ and\r\n_corpo_—the _silvestre_ and the _reburrum_—may have offended the\r\ndelicate Italian musical ear; and it is perfectly easy for a pretty\r\nwell-educated English one to perceive that _donna_, with the ring of the\r\n_n_’s and the sudden descent—the falcon drop—to _a_, is a far more\r\npoetical word than _femina_, where, except the termination, there is no\r\nhold for the voice at all; it merely “slips over” the “lubric” syllables\r\n_fe_ and _mi_. But it is much more difficult to understand the objection\r\nto _dolciada_ and _piacevole_ as too effeminate. Not only is _dolciada_\r\nitself a very charming word to _us_, but it is impossible to see\r\nanything more effeminate in it than in many of those which Dante admits\r\nand admires. These things, however, will always happen.\r\n\r\nThe metaphor of the _pexa_ and _hirsuta_, odd as it seems, is not\r\ndifficult to work out when we have once accepted the [Sidenote: _The_\r\npexa.] analogy of hair, for which in itself it would not be difficult to\r\nfind a more or less fanciful justification. The merely “glossy”—smooth,\r\nsoft, insufficient—will not do, and those “brushed the wrong way” still\r\nless. What is wanted is _natural_ curl and wave—with light and colour in\r\nthem, of course, though not mere gloss. This may be either the result of\r\ncareful “combing out” of all tangle and disorder, or it may be wilder\r\ngrace, the _hirsutum_, the “floating hair” of _our_ poet. Dante’s rigid\r\northodoxy makes him assign very strict qualification to the _pexa_. They\r\nare to be trisyllabic or _vicinissima_ to this—that is to say, they are\r\neither to be amphibrachs complete—_amore_, _difesa_, _salute_—or words\r\nlike _donna_, on the one hand, or _letizia_[584] on the other, which, by\r\na slight rest of the voice or a little slur of it, can be made\r\namphibrachic in character. And why? Because these amphibrachic words\r\nhelp, as no others can do, to give that trochaic swing, with little\r\nintervals between, which supplies the favourite rhythm of Italian\r\npoetry, as in the very instance given a little later by Dante from his\r\nown poetry—\r\n\r\n            “Donne _ch_‘ _a_vete _inte_lletto _d_’ _a_more”—\r\n\r\nwhere the rhythm (as opposed to the actual scansion) of the line is\r\nrepresented by almost sinking the italicised syllables, and leaving the\r\nfour main trochees to carry the rock of the verse on their backs. The\r\ndislike to aspirates, to double _x_’s and _z_’s, to certain collocations\r\nof consonants, &c., is again purely Italian, though it would not be\r\ndifficult to assign somewhat similar qualifications to the _pexa_ of\r\nother languages.\r\n\r\nFootnote 584:\r\n\r\n  This word is most unluckily misprinted “l_i_ti_r_ia” in Mr\r\n  Ferrers-Howell’s version.\r\n\r\nBut Dante is far too free and far too opulent a poet to confine himself,\r\nor recommend others to confine themselves, to a mere [Sidenote: _The_\r\nhirsuta.] “prunes and prism”—to simple prettiness of precious words. The\r\n_hirsuta_, the more careless ordered vocabulary, must be had too\r\nsometimes, because you cannot do without them, as in the case of the\r\nmonosyllabic particles, copulatives, and what not, sometimes as\r\ndissyllables, and polysyllables, which will make an ornamental effect by\r\ncombination and contrast with the _pexa_. Here, yet once more, there may\r\nbe difficulties with the individual cases; it is indeed hard to see the\r\npossibility of beauty, even in the most combed-out company, of such a\r\nword as _disavventuratissimamente_: but the principle is clear and\r\nsound. What that principle is we may [Sidenote: _Other critical_ loci\r\n_in Dante_.] shortly state when we have given a glance at Dante’s other\r\nand much less important critical utterances, contained in the\r\nundoubtedly genuine _Convito_, and in the sometimes, but perhaps\r\ncaptiously, disputed _Letter to Can Grande_.\r\n\r\nThis last[585], which, as is well known, sets itself forth as a\r\ndedication of the _Paradiso_ to the Lord of Verona, contains a kind of\r\n[Sidenote: _The Epistle to Can Grande._] expository criticism by the\r\nauthor of the _Commedia_ itself. There is nothing in it inconsistent\r\nwith the _De Vulgari_, but the method is very much more scholastic and\r\njejune. There are six things to be inquired about in any serious\r\nmatter—the subject, the agent, the form, the end, the title, the kind of\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 585:\r\n\r\n  Original, tenth and last of Latin _Epistles_, ed. Moore, p. 414. Those\r\n  who wish for an English translation will find one in the Appendix to\r\n  Miss Katharine Hillard’s translation of the _Convito_ (p. 390, London\r\n  1889).\r\n\r\nThe _Paradiso_ is different from the other two _cantiche_ in subject,\r\nform, and title, not in author, end, and philosophic tone. The meaning\r\nor subject is partly literary, partly allegorical; the form is\r\nduplex—the external by _cantiche_, cantos, verses; while the method or\r\ninternal form is poetic, figurative, &c. The title is, “Here beginneth\r\nthe Comedy of D. A., Florentine by birth not disposition.” Comedy comes\r\nfrom, &c., tragedy from, &c. As Comedy begins ill and ends well, we call\r\nthis a comedy. It is in the vulgar tongue: its end is evangelic, its\r\nphilosophy ethical and practical.\r\n\r\nThere is little to notice here except the poet’s comparative\r\ndepreciation of the Vulgar Tongue as “humble and weak,”[586] but this of\r\ncourse is only said rhetorically.\r\n\r\nFootnote 586:\r\n\r\n  § 10. _Remissus est modus et humilis quia loquutio vulgaris in qua et\r\n  mulierculæ communicant._\r\n\r\nThe curious First Book of the _Convito_[587] not merely contains the\r\npromise of the _De Vulgari_[588], but is a sort of pendent [Sidenote:\r\n_The_ Convito.] to it, being an elaborate excuse for writing the book in\r\nthe Vulgar tongue itself. Its expressions are not always in literal\r\nagreement with those of the other treatise; but these differences, even\r\nthe exaltation of Latin as “nobler,”[589] in an apparent contradiction\r\nto the argument of the later book, are sufficiently accounted for by the\r\ndifference of purpose and subject. But the elaborate apology for writing\r\nin the vernacular, and the elaborate arguments by which it is supported,\r\nhave no small critical interest of their own; and the later chapters\r\ncontain eager championship of Italian, if not against Latin, yet against\r\nProvençal, which it was the fashion to compare to it. It is scarcely\r\nnecessary to go through this book in detail; but it contains some very\r\ninteresting glimpses, and, as it were, _vistas_ of critical truth. The\r\ntwo most noteworthy of these are the remarks about translation, and\r\nthose about the respective advantages for showing a language of prose\r\nand verse.\r\n\r\nFootnote 587:\r\n\r\n  Italian, ed. Moore, p. 235 _sq._ English, Miss Hillard, as above.\r\n  There is the usual fighting about its date.\r\n\r\nFootnote 588:\r\n\r\n  I. v. 3, at end.\r\n\r\nFootnote 589:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., at beginning. The ground of exaltation is that same notion of\r\n  the greater _stability_ of Latin, of its being unlikely to “play the\r\n  bankrupt with books,” which subsisted till the time of Bacon and\r\n  Hobbes, if not of Johnson, though without the apparent justification\r\n  it had in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nTranslation Dante condemns utterly. Nothing harmonised by the laws of\r\nthe Muses can be changed from one tongue to [Sidenote: _Dante on\r\nTranslation._] another without destroying all its sweetness and harmony.\r\nThis (which is arch-true) connects itself directly with Dante’s unerring\r\ndirection towards the criticism of form. If “all depends on the\r\nsubject,” translation can do no harm, for the subject can be maintained\r\nin exactly the same condition through more languages than Mezzofanti or\r\nPrince Lucien Bonaparte ever meddled with. But the form, the language,\r\nthe charm of the verse, the music of the composition, _they_ go utterly\r\nand inevitably; and even if the translator succeeds in putting something\r\nin their place, it is another, and not themselves.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the eloquent and admirable defence[590] of the tongue of _Si_\r\nagainst the _Lingua d’Oco_, he has this remarkable saying, [Sidenote:\r\n_On language as shown in prose and verse._] that you cannot see its real\r\nexcellence in rhymed pieces, for the accidental accompaniments\r\n(“accidental,” _quoad_ language). So do the clothes and jewels of a\r\nbeautiful woman distract the attention from her real beauty, as much as\r\nthis is set forth by them. In prose the ease, propriety, and sweetness\r\nof the language itself can best be shown. Now, let it be observed that\r\nthis is no exaltation of prose above poetry as such—Dante was far too\r\ngood a critic, as well as far too great a poet, to make a blunder which\r\nhas been made since, though hardly before. His argument is the perfectly\r\nsound, and, unless I mistake, almost wholly novel one—that the\r\n_intrinsic_ powers (if they be doubted) of a language are best shown in\r\nprose. If it can do well there, _a fortiori_ it can do better in poetry;\r\nbut the “added sweetness” of rhythm, metre, rhyme, poetic diction, and\r\nthe like may distract the attention from the mere and sheer merits of\r\nthe language itself. And so once more we find Dante, in opposition to\r\nthe Master, in opposition to all ancient critics except Longinus, and\r\npartly even to him, recognising the ultimate and real test of literary\r\nexcellence as lying in the expression, not in the meaning.\r\n\r\nFootnote 590:\r\n\r\n  I. x. 5.\r\n\r\nThis would in itself be a thing so great that no greater has met or will\r\nmeet us throughout this history. Even yet the truth, which Longinus\r\ncaught but as in a Pisgah-sight, which [Sidenote: _Final remarks on his\r\ncriticism._]Dante himself rather felt and illustrated throughout than\r\nconsciously or deliberately championed in any particular place—the truth\r\nthat the criticism of literature is first of all the criticism of\r\nexpression as regards the writer, of impression as regards the reader—is\r\nfar from being universally recognised, is far even from being a\r\nprevailing or a popular doctrine. By many it is regarded as an\r\nunquestionable heresy, by others as a questionable half-truth. But that\r\nDante did feel, if he hardly saw, it, that he was penetrated by it, that\r\nhis criticism in the _De Vulgari Eloquio_ turns on it—for these things I\r\nhope to have shown some cause.\r\n\r\nNot of course (it may, though it should not, be necessary to repeat\r\nthis) that he was himself by any means indifferent to the “subject.” On\r\nthe contrary, the great threefold division of the subjects of high\r\npoetry into _Salus_, _Venus_, _Virtus_—Arms, Love, and religiously\r\nguided Philosophy—is to this day the best that exists. And here too\r\nDante has made a notable advance on the ancients, in admitting Love to\r\nequality in principle, to the primacy (I had almost said), in practice.\r\nWe saw how the good Servius found it necessary to apologise for the\r\nfourth book of the Æneid, as dealing with the trifling subject of Love;\r\nwe know how Greek criticism slighted Euripides, not, as it might have\r\ndone, for his literary shortcomings, but because of his reliance on the\r\ntender passion; we know further how, except in mystical philosophisings\r\nof the Platonic kind, there is nothing satisfactory on the matter\r\nanywhere—that not merely Dionysius but Longinus, in the very act of\r\npreserving for us the two chief love-poems of the ancient world, can\r\nfind nothing adequate to say about them, and that Aristotle leaves the\r\nsubject severely alone.\r\n\r\nHere also Dante knew better; here also he expressed consummately all the\r\nenormous gain of dream which the sleep of the Dark Ages had poured into\r\nthe heart and the soul of the world. But here his service, though\r\ncritical in category, was hardly critical in method; and, besides, he\r\nwas only one of a myriad. From Brittany to Transylvania, and from\r\nIceland to Provence, the whole thirteenth century, if not the whole\r\ntwelfth also, had been “full of loves”—there had been no fear of “Venus”\r\nbeing forgotten. But all these thousand singers had simply sung because\r\nthey must or would. They had had no critical thought of the manner of\r\ntheir singing. If they had written in Latin, it was because of custom,\r\nbecause they wanted learned appreciation, because they had been taught\r\nto write in Latin. If they had written in the vernacular, it was because\r\nit came naturally to them, and there was guerdon for it.\r\n\r\nBut this, as we have seen, was not possible to Dante. Ever a fighter, he\r\nwas not content to serve the Illustrious Vernacular, to write in it, to\r\nadvance its powers, without arguing for it as well, without giving it a\r\ncritical title to place and eminence. Ever a thinker, too, he was not\r\nsatisfied to write the best poetry, but must know how and in what the\r\nbest poetry consisted, what made it best, what were its resources and\r\nstores of attack and of charm. Most fortunately, his conviction that\r\n_vulgare_ and _regulare_ were two very different things, and that the\r\nmethods of treating them must be different also, led him, as it would\r\nseem, to abandon the devices of the regular Rhetoric, and to construct,\r\nhalf-consciously no doubt, a new and really Higher Rhetoric of the\r\nvulgar tongue itself.\r\n\r\nThis is what we have systematically, if incompletely, for Poetics in the\r\n_De Vulgari Eloquio_, while we have hints towards a prose Rhetoric in\r\nthe first book of the _Banquet_[591]. And it cannot be too much insisted\r\non that, in the former case definitely and systematically, in the latter\r\nby sample and suggestion rather than directly, a kind of criticism is\r\ndisclosed of which we hardly find any trace in the ancients (Longinus\r\npartly excepted), though if Aristotle had worked out one side of his own\r\ndoctrines, and had been less afraid of Art and its pleasure, we might\r\nhave had it from him.\r\n\r\nFootnote 591:\r\n\r\n  It is not quite trivial that, as in the other case there is the\r\n  dispute between _Eloquium_ and _Eloquentia_, so there is here between\r\n  _Convito_ and _Convivio_.\r\n\r\nThat the book itself remained so long unknown, and that even after its\r\nbelated publication it attracted little attention, and has for the most\r\npart been misunderstood, or not understood at all, is no doubt in part\r\nconnected with the fact of its extraordinary precocity. On the very\r\nthreshold of modern literature, Dante anticipates and follows out\r\nmethods which have not been reached by all, or by many, who have had the\r\nadvantage of access to the mighty chambers whereof the house has since\r\nbeen built and is still a-building.\r\n\r\nWe shall see nothing like this in the rest of the present Book. Some\r\nuseful work on Prosody, a little contribution of the usual Rhetoric,\r\nsome interesting if indirect critical expression, will meet us. But no,\r\nor next to no, such criticism properly so called, no such exploration\r\nand exposition of the secrets of the literary craft, no such revelation\r\nof the character of the literary bewitchment.[592]\r\n\r\nFootnote 592:\r\n\r\n  I have not thought it necessary to devote any space to the\r\n  consideration of the relations of Scholastic Philosophy to Criticism.\r\n  To search the whole literature of Scholasticism for these would be an\r\n  enormous labour; and some slight knowledge of the subject (to which I\r\n  once hoped to devote much of the time and energy actually, but\r\n  involuntarily, spent on things less worthy and less interesting) leads\r\n  me to believe that it would be an almost wholly fruitless one. In\r\n  Dante and in Boccaccio (_v. infra_) we have interesting examples of\r\n  the bent which scholastic education gave to critics. Lully, or “Lull,”\r\n  as they call him now (though he by no means rhymes to “dull”), shows\r\n  (_v._ note, p. 371) how criticism afar off might strike a schoolman.\r\n  But all the men of the schools abode in mere Rhetoric, and even that\r\n  they mostly despised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                THE FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH CENTURIES.\r\n\r\nLIMITATIONS OF THIS CHAPTER—THE MATERIAL IT OFFERS—THE FORMAL ARTS OF\r\n    RHETORIC AND OF POETRY—EXAMPLES OF INDIRECT CRITICISM: CHAUCER—‘SIR\r\n    THOPAS’—FROISSART—RICHARD OF BURY—PETRARCH—BOCCACCIO—HIS WORK ON\r\n    DANTE—THE ‘TRATTATELLO’—THE ‘COMENTO’—THE ‘DE GENEALOGIA\r\n    DEORUM’—GAVIN DOUGLAS—FURTHER EXAMPLES UNNECESSARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contents of the two foregoing chapters should have in some sort\r\nprepared the reader for the character and limitations of the [Sidenote:\r\n_Limitations of this chapter._] third. If it were not part of the scheme\r\nof this work to leave no period of literary history unnoticed in\r\nrelation to criticism, a straight stride might almost be taken from the\r\n_De Vulgari Eloquio_ to the earliest of the momentous and (from some\r\npoints of view) rather unfortunate attempts which the Italian critics of\r\nthe Renaissance made to bring about an _eirenicon_ between Plato and\r\nAristotle, by sacrificing the whole direct product, and the whole\r\nindirect lesson, of the Middle Ages. Between Dante and this group of his\r\ncompatriots two hundred years later, it is scarcely too much to say that\r\nthere is not a single critic or criticism, either in Italy or in any\r\nother European language, possessing substantive importance. But this\r\nbook endeavours to be a history, not merely of explicit literary\r\ncriticism, but of implicit literary taste; and no period—not the dimmest\r\ngloom of the Dark Ages nor the most glaring blaze of the _Aufklärung_—is\r\nprofitless as a subject for inquiry in that respect, even if the result\r\nbe little more than the old stage-direction—_même jeu_.\r\n\r\nIn _Arts of Rhetoric_, with or without special or partial reference to\r\nPoetry, the two centuries, especially the fifteenth, are [Sidenote: _The\r\nmaterial it offers._] indeed fairly prolific. Nothing could be more\r\nsignificant for the subjective side of Critical History than that\r\ngradual and at last undisguised identification of “Rhetoric” with\r\n“Poetry” itself, which is notorious alike in the hackneyed title of\r\n_grands rhétoriqueurs_ for the French poets of the fifteenth century,\r\nand the continual praise of Chaucer’s “rhetoric” by the English and\r\nScottish writers of the same time. The _sacra fames_[593] of the whole\r\ntwo hundred years for Allegory—a hunger which was not in the least\r\nchecked by the Renaissance, though the sauce of what it glutted itself\r\non was somewhat altered—is another capital fact of the same kind; the\r\nrenewed passion for changed kinds of Romance another; the\r\never-increasing interest in drama yet another still. These are the real\r\nmaterials for the student of criticism and taste at this time, and they\r\nare identical with the materials, for this period, of the student of\r\nliterary history generally. In the strictly proper matter of our\r\nparticular province we not merely may, but had best, confine ourselves\r\nto some short notice of the formal writings of the period, and some,\r\nrather fuller, of the literary opinions expressed by characteristic\r\nexponents of it, whether their claim to represent be derived from\r\neminence, or from merely average, and therefore tell-tale, quality.\r\n\r\nFootnote 593:\r\n\r\n  The “cursed appreciation,” as a modern wit has translated the phrase\r\n  in its most famous context.\r\n\r\nInto the first it will not be necessary to enter at any length. The\r\nformal Latin Arts of Rhetoric of the fourteenth and fifteenth [Sidenote:\r\n_The Formal Arts of Rhetoric._]centuries exhibit nothing new, but\r\nobserve with a touching fidelity the lines of Martianus, or Aphthonius,\r\nor Hermogenes, as the case may be. Moreover, such notice of them as is\r\nat all necessary will be better given in the next Book and volume, in\r\nconnection with their immediate successors of the undoubted Renaissance.\r\nThe chain of merely formal Rhetoric is unbroken till much later; as it\r\nhad been little affected by the change from “Classical” to “Mediæval,”\r\nso it was not sensibly changed till “Renaissance” had definitely given\r\nway to “Modern.” The vernacular _Arts of Poetry_ are, in English of this\r\nperiod, non-existent; and, considering all things, they are heartily to\r\nbe congratulated on their wisdom and foresight in not existing. In Italy\r\nthey are of little moment, since Italian poetry had to a great extent\r\ntaken its line once for all. In French and in German they both exist,\r\nand exhibit considerable individual quality. But that quality is\r\nemphatically for an age, and not of all time. The growth of the\r\nexquisitely graceful but dangerously artificial French poetry of\r\n_Ballade_ and _Chant Royal_, of _rondeau_ and _triolet_; the growth of\r\nthe artificial, but rarely in the very least graceful, form-torturing of\r\nthe _meister-singers_ were both accompanied and followed, as was natural\r\nand indeed inevitable, by abundance of formal directions for executing\r\nthe fashionable intricacies. Some of the more noteworthy of these may be\r\nindicated in a note but—as has not always been, and will not always be\r\nthe case with similar things—they require little or no discussion in the\r\ntext. For the developments to which they related were not merely a\r\nlittle artificial in the bad sense, but they were also purely episodic\r\nand of the nature of curiosities. They had not, as even the most\r\napparently preposterous acrobatics of the Latin rhythmic had, the\r\npriceless [Sidenote: _And of Poetry._] merit of serving as gymnastic to\r\nthe new vernaculars—at best they only continued this gymnastic in the\r\ncase of languages that were “grown up.” That they—at least the French\r\ndivision of them—furnished some exquisite moulds, into which the purest\r\npoetry could be thrown, is perfectly true. But Jehannot de Lescurel, and\r\nCharles d’Orléans, and Villon most of all, could have, and doubtless\r\nwould have, produced that poetry in any form that happened to be popular\r\nat their time. Nay, as has been abundantly shown in France and England\r\nduring the last quarter of the nineteenth century and a little earlier,\r\nthe forms themselves will fit any poetry of any time. The ancient names,\r\nand the mediæval trimmings, and the modern sentiment of the _Dames du\r\nTemps Jadis_, are all equally at home in its consummate but artificial\r\nform; and that form is equally suitable to the _Voyage à Cythère_ and\r\nthe aspiration for a grave on the breast of the Windburg. Defect there\r\nis none in this accommodating character: rather there is a great\r\nquality. But, in the special kind of merit, there is a differentiation\r\nfrom such things as the Greek chorus, the Latin elegiac, the Mediæval\r\nrhythmus, the mono-rhymed or single-assonanced _tirade_, the Spenserian,\r\neven the eighteenth-century, couplet, which carry their atmosphere and\r\ntheir time inseparably with them. And so we may turn to our testings of\r\nwriters in whom the criticism “is not so expressed,” but who are not the\r\nless valuable to us for that.\r\n\r\nAre we to regret, or not, that Chaucer did not leave us an _Art of\r\nRhetoric_ instead of a _Treatise on the Astrolabe_? Probably not.\r\n[Sidenote: _Examples of Indirect Criticism: Chaucer._] He would hardly\r\nhave felt what is called in religious slang “freedom” to say what he\r\nundoubtedly might have said on Applied Rhetoric and on Pure Rhetoric,\r\nthough it would have been very agreeable to hear him. He would probably\r\nnot have told us anything new. In any kind of formal writing he would\r\nprobably have displayed that not in the least irrational orthodoxy which\r\nhe displays on most subjects. But there is perhaps no writer—at least no\r\nwriter of anything approaching his greatness—who, abstaining from\r\ndeliberate and expressed critical work, has left us such acute and\r\nunmistakable critical byplay, such escapes of the critical spirit. If\r\nthe sly hit at his namesake of Vinsauf, which has been already glanced\r\nat[594], stood alone, it would show us “what a _critic_ was in Chaucer\r\nlost”—at least to the extent of lying _perdu_ for the most part. But\r\nthis is not the only example of the kind by any means, even in apparent\r\nchance-medleys: while in the _Rhyme of Sir Thopas_[595] we have what is\r\nalmost a criticism in form, and what certainly displays more critical\r\npower than ninety-nine out of a hundred criticisms in fact.\r\n\r\nFootnote 594:\r\n\r\n  _V. supra_, p. 412.\r\n\r\nFootnote 595:\r\n\r\n  I must apologise to those who hold that Chaucer never rhymed -_y_ and\r\n  -_ye_ for ascribing _Sir Thopas_ to him. But I really cannot give it\r\n  up as Chaucerian.\r\n\r\nThat this celebrated and agreeable fantasy-piece is in any sense an\r\nonslaught on Romance, as Romance, is so fond a thing that it is\r\nsufficient to discredit the imaginations, or the intelligence, of those\r\nwho entertain it. Dulness never will understand, either that those who\r\nare not dull can laugh at what they love, or that it is possible for a\r\nman to see faults, and even serious faults, in writers and writings on\r\nwhom and on which, as wholes, he bestows the heartiest admiration. From\r\nthe outset of his career the critic has to make up his mind to be\r\ncharged with “ungenerous,” or “grudging,” or “not cordial” treatment of\r\nthose whom he loves with a love that twenty thousand of his accusers\r\ncould not by clubbing together equal, and understands with an\r\nunderstanding of which—not of course by their own fault but by that of\r\nProvidence—they are simply incapable.\r\n\r\nOf this touch of foolish nature the inference from _Sir Thopas_ that\r\nChaucer disliked, or despised, or failed to sympathise with, [Sidenote:\r\nSir Thopas.] Romance, is one of the capital instances. To remember that\r\nthe author of the _Rhyme_ was also the author of the _Knight’s Tale_,\r\nand the _Squire’s Tale_, and _Troilus_, that he was the translator of\r\nthe _Romance of the Rose_, might of itself suffice to keep the wayfaring\r\nman straight in this matter; but those who can understand what they read\r\nhave not the slightest need of such a memory. There have been\r\nparodies[596] of Romance which incurred the curse of blasphemy: there is\r\none in particular, not very many years old, which, in the energetic and\r\naccurate language of Mr Philip Pirrip, “must excite Loathing in every\r\nrespectable mind.” But _Sir Thopas_, even to those who have not read\r\nmany of its originals and victims, much more to those who are well\r\nacquainted with them, and who rejoice in them exceedingly and\r\nunceasingly, can never put on any such complexion. The intense\r\ngood-humour and the absolutely unruffled play of intelligence, the\r\ncomplete freedom from (what appears for instance capitally in the\r\nexample just glanced at) political, national, social _animus_, and the\r\nalmost miraculous fashion in which the caricature strikes at the\r\ncorruptions, but never at the essential character, of the thing\r\ncaricatured, settle this once for all.\r\n\r\nFootnote 596:\r\n\r\n  Not _Rebecca and Rowena_. I think it barely desirable to insert this\r\n  note because quite recently a person, not demonstrably insane, called\r\n  that exquisite piece of Romantic humour “distressing,” or some such\r\n  word.\r\n\r\nIf we knew (as unluckily we do _not_ know) whether the Host and the\r\ncompany stopped _Sir Thopas_ because they disliked the type, or because\r\nthe example was a parody, it would be a great help to us; but it is\r\nscarcely a less help to perceive clearly that its critical character\r\nwould have been enough to put them out of conceit with it. Few people\r\nreally do like criticism; fewer still like real criticism. And the\r\ncriticism of _Sir Thopas_, though disguised, is very real. Everybody,\r\nwhether he knows the metrical romances of the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies or not, can see the joke of the seemly nose; the far country\r\nof Flanders; the rebuke to the maidens, who had much better have been\r\nsleeping quietly than fussing about the beautiful knight; the calm\r\ndecision of that knight that an elf-queen—nobody less—must be the object\r\nof his affections; the terrible wilderness, where buck and hare ramp and\r\nroar, and seek whom they may devour; the extraordinarily heroic\r\nexertions, which consist merely in pumping the unhappy steed; the fair\r\nbearing, which consists in running away with celerity and success. But\r\nnobody who does not know the romances themselves in their weakest\r\nexamples, such as _Sir Eglamour_ or _Torrent of Portugal_, can fully\r\nappreciate the manner in which the parody is adjusted to the original.\r\nNot the deftest and most disinterested critic of any day could single\r\nout, by explicit criticism, the faults “before the Eternal” of the\r\nfeebler and more cut-and-dried romance, more clearly or more accurately\r\nthan Chaucer has, by example, in this tale. The stock epithet and\r\nphrase; the stock comparison; the catalogue (he had himself indulged\r\npretty freely in the catalogue); the pound of description to an ounce of\r\nincident; the mixture of the hackneyed and the ineffective in the\r\nincident itself,—all these things this mercilessly candid friend, this\r\nmaliciously expert practitioner, exposes with the precision of an\r\nAristotle and the zest of a Lucian.\r\n\r\nYet the whole is done by implication and unexpounded example, not in the\r\nvery least by direct criticism. Had it occurred to him, or pleased him,\r\nhe could no doubt have censured all these faults in as businesslike and\r\ndirect a manner as his Parson (or rather his Parson’s original) censures\r\nthe moral, social, and fashionable shortcomings of the age. But he\r\ncertainly did not do this, and probably he never thought of doing it.\r\n\r\nCross the Channel (though indeed it was not always necessary to do this)\r\nand take Chaucer’s greatest contemporary among French [Sidenote:\r\n_Froissart._] writing men. It has been said, by that very agreeable\r\nbiographer of Froissart whom England (mindful of his early loyalty, and\r\ncharacteristically neglectful of his later infidelity) lent to France,\r\nthat he “was not a man of letters.”[597] It may be so: but if it be, he\r\nwas certainly one of the most literary not-men-of-letters that the world\r\nhas ever seen. Not only is he admittedly one of that world’s most\r\ncharming prose-writers, but it has long been known that the notion of\r\nhim (if it ever existed among the intelligent) as of a good garrulous\r\nold person who wrote as the birds sing, is utterly erroneous. At one\r\ntime he could make a mosaic of borrowed and original writing—the\r\nborrowings often in the very words of the original, the original\r\nadjusted to them with an art that nobody but Malory has ever approached,\r\nand that even Malory shows rather in general management than in style.\r\nAt another, and at another again, he could, whether with or against the\r\ngrain, laboriously recast this mosaic into the most widely different\r\nforms. His very desultoriness is calculated; he is criticising the\r\nromances by imitation when he makes a _chassé-croisé_ to the story of\r\nOrthon from the victory of Aljubarrota, from the battle of Otterburn to\r\nthe evil receipt for a green wound adopted by Geoffrey Tête-Noire, and\r\nthe remarkably sensible, just, kindly, and gentlemanly remarks of that\r\ndying brigand to his fellow-outlaws.\r\n\r\nFootnote 597:\r\n\r\n  _Froissart._ Par Mary Darmesteter (Paris, 1894), p. 19.\r\n\r\nBut he is not a man of prose letters only. He is a poet, to the tune of\r\nsome thirty thousand verses in the long-lost and late-won _Méliador_\r\nalone, to the tune of, I suppose, about as many more in his familiar, or\r\nat least long accessible, minor poems. He is deft at all the intricate\r\npopular forms of the day—at _pastourelles_ as at _chansons royaux_, at\r\n_virelais_ as at _rondelets_. He possesses its learning; and can not\r\nonly appeal to the common tales of Troy and Thebes and Alexander, not\r\nonly refer to ancient mythology with the semi-pagan docility which long\r\npuzzled students, and seems to puzzle some still, but be even at home\r\nwith Enclimpostair, and Pynoteus, and Neptisphelè. In a certain sense he\r\nis a man of letters, a man of books, all his life, and very much more\r\nthan Chaucer is. With all his patronisings by great people and his\r\nsojourns among them, he is nothing like the man of affairs that Master\r\nGeoffrey was.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in a sense also, Madame Darmesteter’s phrase is intelligible\r\nand almost justifiable. It is indeed hardly fair to base this\r\nconstruction on his scanty and not in the least literary reference to\r\nChaucer, whom he does not even, like Eustache Deschamps[598], call a\r\ngreat translator. In Froissart’s happy early English time Chaucer had\r\ndone probably little work, and certainly none of his best: in that\r\nmelancholy revisiting, no more of the blaze of the sun of Cressy and\r\nPoitiers, but of the glimpses of the moon that was to set in blood at\r\nPontefract, he was probably too old and too disgusted to make inquiries\r\nabout such matters. But the absence of the strictly literary interest in\r\none who not merely had so much literary genius, but was so constantly\r\nreading and writing, is pervading and incessant. This interest is absent\r\nnot merely where it might well have been present, but where its presence\r\nseems almost indispensable. Froissart’s style of poetry invites the\r\nwidest, and (except that it is rather too methodical, not to say\r\nmechanical) the wildest, liberty of divagation, of dragging in anything\r\nthat really interested him. In the most recondite allegorising of the\r\n_Prison Amoureuse_ he expostulates[599] with Desire for not coming to\r\nhis aid, and giving him the victory, by the same sort of clever\r\noutflanking attack as that which Chandos executed at the Battle of\r\nAuray, and of which he kindly gives some details. He names books in the\r\nusual manner of Romance; he will go so far as to praise them; but he\r\nnever discusses them. In the well-known passage[600] of the _Espinette\r\nAmoureuse_, when he asks his beloved the name of the romance she is\r\nreading, she does indeed tell him that it is _Cléomadès_ (Did he mention\r\nthe same to Chaucer?), with the commendation that it is “well made and\r\ndittied amorously,” and she asks him to lend her another (it is the\r\n_Bailiff of Love_[601] that he hits upon),\r\n\r\n                   “Car lire est un douls mestiers.”\r\n\r\nBut, though the comparing of critical opinions on literature has been\r\nnot unknown as one of the primrose paths of the garden of Flirtation,\r\nthey seem to have trodden it no farther.\r\n\r\nFootnote 598:\r\n\r\n  Deschamps, a far more _exclusively_ bookish person than Froissart, and\r\n  one who has even left us, in his elaborate _Art de Dittier_, not the\r\n  least remarkable of the formal “Poetics” referred to above, is no more\r\n  of a critic in any true sense than Froissart himself—not nearly so\r\n  much as Sidonius or Eberhard.\r\n\r\nFootnote 599:\r\n\r\n  _Œuvres de Froissart (Poésies)_, par A. Scheler, 3 vols. (Bruxelles,\r\n  1870), i. 303.\r\n\r\nFootnote 600:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., p. 107 _sq._\r\n\r\nFootnote 601:\r\n\r\n  _Cléomadès_ (which is possibly not unconnected with Chaucer’s\r\n  _Squire’s Tale_) whoso will may know and (if he be of my mind) rejoice\r\n  in (ed. Van Hasselt, Bruxelles, 1865). But, alas! we have not the\r\n  _Bailiff of Love_.\r\n\r\nSo in his prose. The _satura_ of the _Chroniques_ admits anything that\r\ninterested either Froissart or the men of his time. In those strange\r\nmidnight sessions of the Italianate Gascon Count of Foix—the lettered\r\ntyrant-sorcerer who would have been even more at home in Ferrara or\r\nRimini than in Béarn—books were in great request; but nobody seems to\r\nhave talked criticism. “So much the better for the Bearnese,” the reader\r\nmay say; and he is welcome to an opinion which, at times, if not always,\r\nmost people must have shared. But that is not the question. The question\r\nis, “Was this a critical age?” and the answer is, “If it had been, a man\r\ncould not have been so bookish as Froissart was and yet be not critical\r\nin the least.” Nor could he, even if some private idiosyncrasy had\r\naccounted for his own attitude, have failed to reveal the presence of a\r\ndifferent one in the time which he has drawn for us, more poetically no\r\ndoubt than Boswell or Pepys, but with not a little of their\r\nunpremeditated, their even unconscious, fidelity.\r\n\r\nThe lesson taught by the two men, who occupy the summits of European\r\nliterature at the very midmost of the period of this [Sidenote: _Richard\r\nof Bury._] chapter, will be confirmed whether we look earlier or later.\r\nIt might seem almost impossible that the somewhat famous\r\n_Philobiblon_[602] of Richard of Bury (or Aungervyle), who made one of\r\nthe greatest collections of books in the early part of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, and celebrated it in this little tract just before his own\r\ndeath and shortly after Chaucer’s probable birth, should not contribute\r\nsomething—improbable that it should not contribute very much—to our\r\nsubject. As a matter of fact it contributes nothing at all. Almost the\r\noldest Sacred Book (as distinguished from “sacred passages” in Cicero\r\nand others) of Bibliophily, it remains entirely outside of literary\r\ncriticism. The good Bishop of Durham, indeed, does not devour all books\r\nwith indiscriminating voracity. He is true to his order in candidly\r\navowing no high opinion of law-books; but his reason—that they belong\r\nrather to Will than to Wit—shows us his point of view. From that point\r\nof view one book may be preferable to another, as being more useful, as\r\ndealing with a nobler subject, as boasting a more venerable authorship,\r\nas being perhaps rarer, more beautifully written or bound, older, newer,\r\nin better condition, but not, I think, at all as being better\r\nliterature. The pleasant garrulity of the tractate; its agreeable\r\nonslaught upon woman, the natural enemy of books; its anecdotage; its\r\nkeen sympathy with the Book as almost a living thing, and certainly one\r\nexposed to almost all the dangers of life, have made it, and will long\r\nmake it, a favourite. It is sweet and pleasant: but it is not criticism.\r\n\r\nFootnote 602:\r\n\r\n  Often printed: the best edition of the original Latin is, I believe,\r\n  that (with French version) of M. Cocheris (Paris, 1856). The late\r\n  Professor H. Morley gave one of the wide biographical excursus of his\r\n  _English Writers_ (iv. 38-58) to Bishop Richard, and included in it a\r\n  pretty full abstract of the _Philobiblon_ (or “Philobibl_i_on”).\r\n\r\nThe author of the _Philobiblon_ was a friend of Petrarch’s, and it may\r\nat first sight seem strange that Petrarch himself should [Sidenote:\r\n_Petrarch._] not be—should not indeed have been at the very beginning or\r\nthis chapter—summoned to give evidence likewise. But the fact is that\r\nPetrarch has nothing to tell us in our context. He has indeed, as has\r\nbeen pretty universally recognised, nothing to do with the Middle Ages.\r\nNot only in his heart and desires, but in his nature, he is a man of the\r\nearly—if of the earliest—Renaissance. Even in the vernacular he rings\r\nfalse as an exponent of anything mediæval. Timotheus, not St Cecily, has\r\ntaught his strains. And in his “regular” writing he is severely, almost\r\nludicrously, a classicaster. We may return to him as the earliest\r\ndistinguished example of the Renaissance attitude; here he cannot even,\r\nas others have done, help us by his silence.\r\n\r\nIt is otherwise with his great contemporary, and at the last friend,\r\nBoccaccio. Boccaccio likewise has been claimed as a prophet of the\r\nRenaissance, as one of the first of the [Sidenote: _Boccaccio._] moderns\r\nand the like; nor would it skill to deny that there is much both of the\r\nRenaissance and of the modern spirit in him. But he has not broken with\r\nthe immediate past; he is only tinging it, and blending it a little,\r\nwith the farther past and the future. If something of the magical charm\r\nof the mediæval prose story is gone from the _Decameron_, the learned\r\nvoluptuousness of the Renaissance _conte_ is not yet there. The\r\n_Filostrato_, and the _Filocopo_[603], and the _Teseide_, are still\r\nromances. And in the _De Genealogia Deorum_, if there is much of that\r\nnon-mediæval spirit which was always in Italy, and not a little of the\r\nRenaissance proper, there is enough of the Middle Age itself to give it\r\na _locus standi_ here.\r\n\r\nFootnote 603:\r\n\r\n  Without prejudice to _Filocolo_. We attempt not to decide such\r\n  quarrels.\r\n\r\nIndeed, by a recent authority of great eminence[604] Boccaccio has been\r\ntreated as a coryphæus and representative of “the [Sidenote: _His work\r\non Dante._] critics of the middle ages.” I have endeavoured, in these\r\nchapters, to show that the critics of the middle ages are, except in the\r\nmost remote and shadowy function, almost a non-existent body. And it\r\nseems to me that Boccaccio’s views on criticism, though most worthy of\r\nremark, are the very head and front of that Renaissance side of him\r\nwhich is so undeniable. In the passage which Mr Courthope cites from the\r\n_Life of Dante_, where Boccaccio says that Theology and poetry are\r\nalmost one, that “Theology is God’s poetry,” that it is a kind of poetic\r\ninvention when Christ is spoken of at one time as a lion, at the other\r\nas a lamb, that the words of the Saviour in the Gospel are merely or\r\nmainly allegory, that “Poetry is Theology and Theology poetry,” and that\r\nAristotle said nearly as much[605]—when he writes in this way he is\r\nspeaking very much less the mind of the Middle Ages than the mind which\r\nagitated the mass of his countrymen, the Italian critics, from Daniello\r\nonwards in the sixteenth century. But it is quite certain that in\r\nwriting this he is writing with a conception of criticism quite alien\r\nfrom that which we are now handling. He may quote Aristotle, but he is\r\nspeaking in the manner of Plato. It is poetry in the abstract with which\r\nhe is dealing, not the literary value of poetry according to its\r\nexpression in form, of no matter what ideal in essence. And it will be\r\nfound, I think, that a careful study of his commentary on Dante, the\r\nmost important thing of the kind that we possess by one considerable man\r\nof letters in the Middle Ages upon another, entirely bears this out.\r\n\r\nFootnote 604:\r\n\r\n  My friend, Mr W. J. Courthope, in the third chapter of his _Life of\r\n  Pope_ (Pope’s _Works_, ed. Elwin and Courthope, v. 50: London, 1889.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 605:\r\n\r\n  Had he known Maximus Tyrius (_v. supra_, p. 117), he might almost have\r\n  borrowed the very words of that writer. But in the astonishingly long\r\n  list of Boccaccio’s classical authorities Maximus does not, I think,\r\n  occur.\r\n\r\nAs for the _Life_ (or, as he himself seems to call it in the first\r\nlecture of the _Commentary_, the “Little Treatise”[606]) on Dante, it is\r\ncouched in so extremely rhetorical a style, with constant bursts of\r\napostrophe and _epiphonema_, that there may seem to be a sort [Sidenote:\r\n_The_ Trattatello.] of warning on it from the first: “Criticism not to\r\nbe expected.” As a matter of fact, however, Boccaccio does give us some\r\nof what, as we shall see more fully in a moment, he thought to be\r\ncriticism, and of what not a few persons seem still to think the best\r\ncriticism. For he has an elaborate digression on Poetry and Poets in the\r\nabstract, with a particular parallel distinction (referred to above)\r\nbetween poetry and theology. But he goes no farther, and the heading\r\n“Qualità e diffetti di Dante” is entirely occupied with moral\r\ncharacteristics. In the _Comento_ itself, however, it might well seem to\r\nbe a case of Now or Never. Here was a literary lectureship expressly\r\ninstituted for the treatment of the greatest man of letters of the city,\r\nthe country, and (as it happened) the world, at the time and for long\r\nbefore and after. Here was an exceedingly learned lecturer, with plenty\r\nof mother-wit to keep his learning alive, with a distinct fellow-feeling\r\nof creation further to animate both, and with the sincerest and\r\nheartiest goodwill to complete his competence. He spares no trouble, but\r\ngoes to his work with scholastic minuteness, expending some three score\r\nlectures and some nine hundred pages on seventeen cantos only out of the\r\nhundred of the _Commedia_. Unfortunately neither his models nor his\r\ntastes seem to incline [Sidenote: _The_ Comento.] him in the way where\r\nwe would so fain see him go. He has read Servius and all (or at least\r\nmany of) the rhetoricians and scholastic philosophers, and he tells us\r\nwith gusto what are the causes, formal, efficient, material, and final,\r\nof the book, how its form is “poetic, fictive, descriptive, digressive,\r\nand transitive,” and how the efficient cause is “that very same author,\r\nDante Alighieri, of whom we will speak more extensively by-and-by.” He\r\nhas also read Fulgentius:[607] and before very long he gives us a\r\ncapital specimen of derivation, in the manner of that ingenious author,\r\nby telling us that “Avernus” is from _a_, which is without, and\r\n_vernus_, which is joy. He has at his command all that extraordinary\r\nsupply of mythological and miscellaneous classical learning which, as we\r\nshall see immediately, enabled him to write his _Genealogy_: and he\r\nnever comes to the name of an ancient writer or of a mythological\r\npersonage without giving a full and particular account thereof. No\r\ndetails are too obvious or too minute for him, even apart from the\r\nallegorical interpretation, in which, as any scholar of Fabius\r\nPlanciades, and indeed any mediæval writer of the fourteenth century,\r\nwas bound to do, he expatiates delightedly. He vouches the information\r\nthat Dante called the forest _selvaggia_ “because he wished to denote\r\nthat there was not in it any human habitation, and that as a consequence\r\nit was horrible;” _aspera_, “in order to demonstrate the quality of the\r\ntrees and shrubs of the same, which would be old, with long straggling\r\nbranches en woven and interpleached among themselves, and likewise full\r\nof blackthorns, and brambles, and dry stubs, growing without any order,\r\nand stretching hither and thither—whereby it was a rough thing and a\r\ndangerous to go through,” &c. He is copious in moral _excursus_ on the\r\nimpropriety of Florentine dress, on the sin of Luxury, on the obvious\r\ninconvenience and hardship of the fact that while men are allowed to try\r\nhorses, asses, oxen, dogs, clothing, casks, pitchers before they buy\r\nthem, they have to take their wives on trust and without trial. But on\r\nliterary criticism we come not seldom, but never, beyond the beggarly\r\nelements of verbal interpretation, where Boccaccio is just as happy with\r\n_Pape Satan_ as with _Galeotto fu il libro_, or rather more so, while he\r\nis much happier with Penthesilea or Pasiphae than with either. It is no\r\ndoubt unfair to try Master John Bochas with the things that make us\r\n“nearly wild” (as Cowper made Miss Marianne Dashwood,[608] and does\r\n_not_ often make us), but still the Galeotto passage is very tempting.\r\nLancelot, we learn, was one of whom the French romances tell many\r\nbeautiful and laudable things (things which he tells us, in confidence,\r\nhe himself believes to be set forth rather to please than according to\r\nthe truth), and the said Lancelot was _ferventissimamente_ enamoured of\r\nGuinevere. Then he points out that the line which follows (_Soli\r\neravamo_, &c.), and the previous mention of the book, indicate three\r\nthings—reading about love, solitude, and freedom from suspicion—which\r\nare very powerful to induce a man and a woman to adoperate dishonestly.\r\nAnd so he proceeds, expounding or construing the whole ineffable\r\npassage, word for word, with a solemn and indiscriminate enjoyment—the\r\ntrembling at the kiss, the fact that Galehault was a kind of giant,\r\ngreat and big, down to _Quel giorno_, his remark on which, though not\r\nscientifically inaccurate, savours rather of the _Decameron_ than of the\r\n_Commedia_ itself. But in the whole comment there is nothing (or, what\r\nis worse than nothing, a single banal _ottimamente descrive_) for any\r\npart whatsoever of the passion, the poetry, the mysterious magnificence\r\nof the expression. The passage is to Boccaccio a good _ecphrasis_, a\r\ncapital _compte rendu_ of an interesting situation—that is all.\r\n\r\nFootnote 606:\r\n\r\n  _Trattatello._ I use the cheap and convenient ed. of the two books\r\n  published by Le Monnier. (Florence, 1863; latest ed. 1895, 2 vols.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 607:\r\n\r\n  He quotes him early, ed. cit., i. 94 (see note opposite).\r\n\r\nFootnote 608:\r\n\r\n  “To hear those beautiful lines, which have frequently almost driven me\r\n  wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful\r\n  indifference!”\r\n\r\n  “... but you _would_ give him Cowper.”\r\n\r\n  “Nay, mamma, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!”—_Sense and\r\n  Sensibility_, chap. iii.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _De Genealogia Deorum_.]\r\n\r\nNor will this be less borne out by an examination of Boccaccio’s\r\nprincipal “place” of criticism, which will be, perhaps somewhat\r\nunexpectedly, found in the two last books, the fourteenth and fifteenth,\r\nof that singular monument of learning, the _De Genealogia Deorum_.[609]\r\nAfter laboriously searching out all the mythological stories of\r\nantiquity within his reach, and co-ordinating them into a regular family\r\nhistory, from Demogorgon, through Erebus and his twenty-one sons and\r\ndaughters by Night, to Alexander and Scipio (whom, however, he declines,\r\nas a strict genealogist, to admit as sons of Jove), Boccaccio, at the\r\nbeginning of his fourteenth book, takes up the cudgels for Poetry\r\nagainst her enemies. The style is decidedly rhetorical, and faint\r\nremembrances of Clodius as an accuser (or, to be less pedantic and less\r\nhackneyed, of Steenie lecturing on the turpitude of incontinence) may\r\npossibly occur, as we find the author of the _Decameron_ indignantly\r\ndenouncing those who sneer at poets and learned men, _meretriculis\r\ngannientes_, and holding cups of foaming wine in their hands. But he is\r\nperfectly serious: if a man has not proved his seriousness by writing a\r\nLatin genealogy of the gods in four hundred large and closely printed\r\nfolio pages, what is Proof? There was always, he says, a quarrel between\r\nLearning and Licentiousness. Even some graver folk sneer at, or find\r\nfault with, poetry. Lawyers do so: and the lawyers are properly rebuked\r\nand bid to look at the example of Cicero. Monks do: and there is\r\nexpostulation likewise with them. But he will attack the question in\r\nform. Poetry is a noble and useful thing. Its meaning, its antiquity,\r\nits origin are discussed. There is nothing wrong or harmful in a “fable”\r\nas such; but in all its kinds it can be made of positive utility. Poets\r\ndo not retire into solitude out of any misanthropy or wrong motive, but\r\nsimply for the sake of meditation: and they have often been the friends\r\nof most respectable people—Ennius of the Scipios, Virgil of Augustus,\r\nDante of King Frederick and Can de la Scala, Francis Petrarch of the\r\nEmperor Charles, of King John of France, of King Robert of Jerusalem and\r\nSicily, and of any number of Popes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 609:\r\n\r\n  There is said, to the discredit of modernity, to be no modern edition\r\n  of this most remarkable and interesting book. Of the three folio\r\n  issues (1494 and later) which are in the library of the University of\r\n  Edinburgh, I have used that of Hervagius (Basle, 1532.)\r\n\r\nBut, some say, poetry is obscure. It is certainly written for the\r\nlearned and people of wit, not for the common herd; but it is none the\r\nworse for that. It is entirely false that poets are liars: poetry and\r\nlying are two quite different things (Virgil is here particularly\r\ncleared in the matter of Dido). It is foolish to condemn what you do not\r\nunderstand: and this is generally done by those who abuse poetry. And it\r\nis intolerable that men should speak against Homer, Hesiod, Virgil,\r\nHorace, Juvenal, when they have hardly read them. The “seduction” of\r\nPoetry is all nonsense: and the accusation that poetry is the ape of\r\nphilosophy, greater nonsense still. It would be better to call poets the\r\napes of Nature.[610]\r\n\r\nFootnote 610:\r\n\r\n  Mr Courthope must, I should think, have overlooked this passage when\r\n  he denied (_loc. cit._) that Boccaccio and other mediæval writers held\r\n  the doctrine that poetry should follow Nature.\r\n\r\nHe does not fear to contest the authority of Jerome when he said that\r\nverses were _Dæmonum cibus_, of Plato himself, and of Boethius when he\r\ncalled the Muses “scenic meretricules.” He grapples with the two first\r\nat great length, and points out that Boethius was thinking chiefly of\r\nthe naughty theatre. An allocution to the King (Hugh of Cyprus and\r\nJerusalem), to whom the whole treatise is dedicated, and a milder\r\ndeprecation to the enemies of poetry, conclude this book.\r\n\r\nThe Fifteenth at first seems to launch out into still deeper waters. You\r\nmust not insist too much on _use_. What is the use of the beard? Yet men\r\nof a certain age are ashamed to be beardless. And as for the duration of\r\nwork, that is in the hand of God. But this turns to a mere excuse of his\r\nown actual book. His work has been done as well as he can do it, both\r\nfor matter and for style. He refers to divers living or recent authors,\r\nDante and Petrarch among them, of whom he gives little descriptions that\r\nraise, but hardly satisfy, our curiosity to see whether he will really\r\ncriticise. Dante was _peritissimus circa poeticam_, and what he was is\r\nshown by his _inclytum opus_, “which he wrote with wonderful art, under\r\nthe title of a Comedy, in rhyme of the Florentine idiom, and in which he\r\ncertainly showed himself not a mythologer but rather a catholic and\r\ndivine Theologian. And while he is known to almost all the world, I know\r\nnot whether the fame of his name has come to your latitude.” Petrarch is\r\ndealt with much more fully. “Even that remote corner of the earth\r\nEngland knows him as a principal poet,”[611] and here Boccaccio no\r\nlonger _nescit utrum_, but _haud dubitat quin_, his fame has reached\r\nCyprus. His “divine” _Africa_, his Bucolics, his Epistles in verse and\r\nprose, and a good many other things, are noticed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 611:\r\n\r\n  By favour of one Geoffrey Chaucer?\r\n\r\nNext he recurs to antiquity, mentioning Homer especially, and defending\r\nhis own practice of mixing Greek words with Latin by the examples of\r\nCicero, Macrobius, Apuleius, and Ausonius. He has a good deal to say\r\n(entirely in a Renaissance spirit) on the importance of the Greeks and\r\nof Greek; defends, against clerical prejudice, his description of the\r\nheathen poets as the theologians of mythology, argues once more that\r\nDante may be called a theologian proper, contends at great length that\r\nthere is no harm in the study of heathen matters by Christians, and,\r\nafter purging himself of other objections, concludes.\r\n\r\nA most interesting document; indeed a document upon which, with\r\nreference both to its general tenor and to individual expressions (of\r\nwhich it has been possible to mention but one or two here), it would be\r\npleasant to spend much more time. But a document which, for our present\r\npurpose and plan, seems to establish in the main two things, both of\r\nthem rather negative than positive. The first is that Boccaccio can\r\nhardly be appealed to either as helping Dantes Aligerus to remove the\r\nreproach from mediæval criticism, in the sense in which we here\r\nunderstand it, or even as a representative proper of mediæval criticism\r\nat all—that his criticism, such as it is, is of a purely Renaissance\r\ntype, and results, not from the application of mediæval ideas to ancient\r\nmatter, but from the application of resuscitated ancient ideas to matter\r\nwhich, though not wholly, is preferably chosen from ancient material. It\r\nis not to be forgotten that even in that creative work which has been\r\nreferred to above, Boccaccio has always preferred the _matière de Rome_,\r\nthe classical side of the mediæval storehouse. From this he has drawn\r\nthe _Teseide_, from this the _Filostrato_, and if in the _Filocopo_ he\r\nhas made a more purely mediæval choice, let it be remembered that\r\n_Floire et Blanche-fleur_, his original, is of all Romances the most\r\nlike a Byzantine novel, and has even been thought to have been directly\r\ninspired by one.\r\n\r\nSecondly, when we examine the character of this criticism of his in\r\ndetail, we find it differing from Dante’s in this, that while Dante\r\nundoubtedly does consider the general and abstract points of poetry and\r\nof literature, Boccaccio practically considers nothing else. His\r\ndescriptions of Dante himself and of Petrarch would suffice to prove\r\nthis: but, in fact, it is proved by every page, every paragraph, every\r\nsentence, almost every word. Throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\nbooks of the _Genealogy_ Boccaccio is really pleading _pro domo sua_—for\r\nthe _status_ and craft of the story-teller generally, not of the poet as\r\nsuch. And further, he is pleading for free trade in the story, not for\r\nany special process of art or craft in its manufacture. He had possibly,\r\nif not certainly, read the _De Vulgari_, but, as he read it, it must\r\nhave been in the first part of the first book only that he found much\r\nthat was germane to his own tastes and principles. If we could but have\r\nhad from himself such an _examen_ of the _Decameron_ as Corneille and,\r\nstill more, Dryden have given of their work! But the time simply did not\r\nadmit of any such thing: and though Boccaccio was very much in advance\r\nof his time in some ways, these ways were not of the some.\r\n\r\nNor does the Fifteenth Century proper necessitate any revision of the\r\ngeneral doctrine of this chapter. There are here and there blind\r\nstirrings of the Renaissance spirit; but, once more, they do not concern\r\nus. There is everywhere the dogged or unconscious adherence to the\r\nuncritical promiscuousness of the past; and that has been sufficiently\r\ncommented upon. If it be, as perhaps it is, desirable to take a single\r\nexample, and deal with it as we have dealt with others, there can hardly\r\nbe a better than Gavin Douglas, who at the very end of the period shows,\r\nside by side with Renaissance tendency (which certainly exists, though\r\nto me it does not seem so great as it has seemed to some), the strongest\r\nsymptoms of persistent mediævalism.\r\n\r\nNobody can deny that the good Bishop of Dunkeld (uneasiest to him of\r\nbishop-stools!) not only would have liked to be a [Sidenote: _Gavin\r\nDouglas._] critic, but shows both his critical and his Renaissance sides\r\nin the well-known and violent onslaught on poor Caxton in the first of\r\nthe very agreeable Prologues to his own translation of the _Æneid_. In\r\nfact, those to whom the woman who killed Abimelech with a stone or slate\r\nis the patron saint of criticism, must regard him as a very considerable\r\ncritic. How Caxton’s work and Virgil’s are “no more like than the Devil\r\nand Saint Austin”; how the author “shamefully perverted” the story; how\r\nthe critic read it “with harms at his heart” that such a book “without\r\nsentence or engine” should be entitled after so divine a bard; how such\r\na wight never knew three words of what Virgil meant; how he, Gavin, is\r\n“constrained to flyte,”—all this is extremely familiar. We seem to hear\r\nthe very voice of the modern “jacket-duster,” of the man who finds his\r\npet task anticipated, his pet subject trespassed upon, and is determined\r\nto make the varlet pay for it. Douglas, to be sure, is not quite in the\r\nworst case of this class of critic. He can render some reasons, neither\r\ngarbled nor forged, for his censure. He has (and this is a sign that\r\ncriticism was stirring) lost taste for, lost even comprehension of, the\r\nfull, guileless, innocent, mediæval licence of suppression, suggestion,\r\nand digression. He protests (quite truly) that Neptune did not join with\r\nÆolus in causing the storm that endangered Æneas, but on the contrary\r\nstilled that storm. He is indignant at the extension given to the true\r\nromantic part of the poem, the Tragedy of Carthage in the Fourth Book,\r\nand only less indignant at the suppression of the “lusty games” and\r\nplays palustral in the Fifth. Most of all does he tell us of that\r\naggravation of the critical misuse of allegory which was to be one of\r\nthe main Renaissance notes. The “hidden meaning” of poetry is the great\r\nthing for Douglas, and he has much to say about it before he “turns\r\nagain” on Caxton. Will it be believed that Caxton wrote \"Touyr for\r\nTiber\"! Alas! alas!\r\n\r\n                “For Touyr divides Greece from Hungarie,\r\n                And Tiber is chief fluide of Italy.”\r\n\r\nBut all this, and a great deal more like it, as the setting up of the\r\nold Rhetoric-Poetic theory of a poem as the story of a perfectly noble\r\ncharacter, and the rebuke even to Chaucer not merely for being too\r\nliteral, just as Caxton was too loose, but for actually saying (the more\r\nChaucer he!) that Æneas was _not_ a perfectly noble character but a\r\nforsworn traitor,—all this argues no real relinquishment of the mediæval\r\nideal except in a special case. Douglas shows in his own work that he is\r\nafter all a chip of the old block, and not fresh hewn from a virgin\r\nquarry.\r\n\r\nIn the Prologue to the Sixth Book he returns to the\r\nallegorical-philosophical interpretation of Virgil, and shows himself a\r\nhundred leagues to leeward of the critical port by urging, in Virgil’s\r\nfavour, that St Augustine is always quoting him against Paganism. Not in\r\nthe whole range of mediæval literature is that pell-mell cataloguing,\r\nwhich, with more truth than reverence, has been assimilated to that of\r\nthe “Groves of Blarney,” better shown than in the _Palice of Honour_.\r\nSolomon, “the well of sapience,” Aristotle, “fulfillit of prudence,”\r\n“Salust, Seneca, and Titus Livius” jostle Pythagoras and Porphyry,\r\nParmenides and “Melysses,” “Sidrach, Secundus, and Solenius,”\r\n“Empedocles, _Neptanabus_, and Hermes,” “wise Josephus and facund\r\nCicero,” with other miraculous couples and trinities. The procession of\r\nthe Court of Venus huddles classical, Biblical, and mediæval in the\r\nsame, but a more pardonable, fashion; and when the Muses intervene to\r\nsave the peccant poet, Dictys and Dares still march unblushingly with\r\nHomer and Virgil. “Plautus, Poggius, and Persius” must have looked only\r\nless oddly, the first and last at the second, than “Esop, Cato, and\r\nAllane” (Alanus de Insulis of the _Anti-Claudianus_ and the _De planetu\r\nNaturæ_) each at other. Such a capital phrase as “the mixt and subtle\r\nMartial,” the valuable naming of contemporary poets that follows, and\r\nother things, may much more than atone for, but cannot hide, the\r\nhiggledy-piggledy character of the cataloguing, or the odd repetition of\r\nthe same thing with a difference at the end of the Second Part, and the\r\nyet further development in the Third. The note of criticism is\r\ndiscrimination—the note of the Middle Age, as of this, almost its latest\r\nexponent, save in the few places where he has chipped his shell, is the\r\nindiscriminate.\r\n\r\nIt can scarcely be necessary, though it might not be uninteresting, to\r\ntake any more examples. We need not [Sidenote: _Further examples\r\nunnecessary._] wander in Hercynian forests with those rules of latest\r\nMiddle High German poetry, which have all the formality of the French\r\n“Arts” and none of the charm of their products. The Marquis of\r\nSantillana and his comrades, in castle or convent of Spain, concern\r\nnational rather than general history, history of literature rather than\r\nhistory of criticism; and they, like others, will best be glanced at\r\nretrospectively in the Renaissance section. From the French\r\n_rhétoriqueur_ period we might pick out much that would illustrate, over\r\nand over again, what has been sufficiently illustrated already, little\r\nthat would give us anything new, nothing or next to nothing that would\r\nbe at once new and important.[612] As will be shown, a little more in\r\ndetail, in the Interchapter which follows, the service which the Middle\r\nAges rendered to Criticism was indeed inestimable; but it was by way of\r\nprovision of fresh material, not by way of examination, either of that\r\nmaterial or of anything older.\r\n\r\nFootnote 612:\r\n\r\n  Considerations of something the same kind may partly excuse a further\r\n  omission—which I know will be deplored by some, and which I daresay\r\n  will be denounced by others—that of any notice of rhetorical and\r\n  metrical writings in the Celtic and Scandinavian languages. I shall\r\n  very frankly acknowledge that there is another reason for this\r\n  omission. I have the greatest dislike to writing about anything at\r\n  second-hand; and while I have as yet had time to acquire only a slight\r\n  knowledge of Icelandic, I do not know anything at all of the Celtic\r\n  languages. With the help of Fors Fortuna, I may be yet able to make\r\n  these defects in some measure good; but I do not think it necessary to\r\n  delay the present volume indefinitely in order to do so. “There is no\r\n  staying,” as Johnson says, “for the concurrence of all conveniences.\r\n  We will do as well as we can.” So far as I have been able to inform\r\n  myself, the rhetorical writing of Icelandic is not extensive or\r\n  important, even though some may have come from the interesting hand of\r\n  Snorri Sturluson. The early Irish metrical treatises are, no doubt, of\r\n  great importance for the history of metre. But being purely\r\n  particularist, and out of the general current of European literature,\r\n  their critical importance can hardly be regarded as of the highest\r\n  kind. And Welsh, while anything of the sort in it must be much later,\r\n  is necessarily in the same position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           INTERCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n§ I. THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE MEDIÆVAL PERIOD TO LITERARY CRITICISM.\r\n\r\n§ II. THE POSITION, ACTUAL AND POSSIBLE, OF LITERARY CRITICISM AT THE\r\n    RENAISSANCE.\r\n\r\n                                   I.\r\n\r\nIn perhaps no part of a work of the present kind is it more important\r\nthan it is here to distinguish between the different kinds of value, for\r\nthe special purpose, of the period in question. If you judge this by its\r\npositive contributions to the standard literature of literary criticism,\r\nit has absolutely nothing of consequence to advance but the _De Vulgari\r\nEloquio_. There is not very much else at all; and what there is consists\r\nmainly of agreeable babblings, of schoolbooks, and of incidental\r\nutterances, which at best can be taken as a kind of _semeiotic_.\r\n\r\nYet, in the _De Vulgari_ itself, the Middle Ages lodged such a\r\ndiploma-piece as has been scarcely half-a-dozen times elsewhere seen in\r\nthe history of the world. And, what is still more important, their\r\ncontributions to productive literature were such that they take, from\r\nthe catholic point of view, equal rank as a whole with those of\r\nclassical and those of modern times, while, for the special critical\r\npurpose, they are almost more valuable than either. Enforced and\r\nnecessary ignorance of what the Middle Ages had to teach accounts in\r\nalmost every case for whatever shortcomings we find in the Classics;\r\nwilful or careless ignoring of this accounts for most of the\r\nshortcomings of the moderns; recourse to it accounts for most of the\r\nmerits, such as they are, of the criticism of the nineteenth century.\r\nThe critic who knows his Middle Ages, knowing also ancient and modern\r\nliterature, and he alone, has the keys of the criticism of the world.\r\n\r\nOf the excellent and astonishing accomplishment of the _De Vulgari\r\nEloquio_ enough has been said already, and it will not require extensive\r\nsurveys to show the small accomplishment in criticism of the Middle Ages\r\nelsewhere. It is almost enough to consider, as we have done, the work of\r\nChaucer, their next man to Dante in genius[613] as a known personality.\r\nChaucer had all or almost all the necessary qualifications of a critic—a\r\nreal knowledge of literature, a distinctly satirical humour, a large\r\ntolerance, a touch, decided but not too frequent, of enthusiasm, an\r\ninterest in a very wide range of different subjects and forms. And he is\r\nactually a critic in embryo, and more, throughout his work. The\r\n_Boethius_ and the _Astrolabe_, the _Rose_ and the _Troilus_, half the\r\n_Canterbury Tales_, more than half the minor works, are saturated with\r\nliterature—could have come from no author but one who was saturated with\r\nliterature. There is uncrystallised criticism on every page; there is\r\neven some crystallised criticism in the _Sir Thopas_, and perhaps\r\nelsewhere. But almost always “it is not so expressed,” and for once\r\nShylock is justified of his refusal to find it. In Chaucer, the strange\r\nmediæval levelling of authors, not merely in respect of trustworthiness,\r\nbut in respect of positive value, continues. Macrobius is as Cicero;\r\nDares is much more than Homer. If he gives an opinion, it is a moral\r\none. He puts the rejection of alliteration on a mere local ground; and\r\nthey will not even let us believe that he laughed at French of\r\nStratford-atte-Bowe from any literary point of view.\r\n\r\nFootnote 613:\r\n\r\n  If, as is still possible, and most probably can never be disproved,\r\n  Walter Map fashioned the perfect Arthur stories, by dint of combining\r\n  the Lancelot-Guinevere romance and the Graal Legend, composed the _De\r\n  Nugis_, and wrote an appreciable quantity of the Goliardic poems, he\r\n  will run Chaucer hard in all but the claims impossible to his time.\r\n  But the “if” is a great if.\r\n\r\nYet while the persistent study of Rhetoric is of great importance, as\r\nexhibiting the keeping up of a critical treatment—such as it is—of\r\nliterature, the growth of the vernacular Poetics is of much more, as\r\ndeveloping a side of formal criticism which was destined to become of\r\nmore and more importance as time went on, and to have a connection with,\r\nand an influence upon, criticism not merely formal, to which there is no\r\nparallel in ancient times. So far as we have any trustworthy evidence,\r\nGreek prosody was born like Pallas—full-grown and fully armed. It has no\r\nknown period of infancy or pupilage: the poets may devise—may even give\r\ntheir names to—ingenious combinations, but all these combinations obey\r\none prearranged system. If the case of Latin is not quite the same, the\r\nperiods where it is most significantly different happen to be periods\r\nwhen criticism had either not come into being or had abdicated its\r\nfunctions. A _De Prosodia Latina_, by Nævius must have been as\r\ninteresting as Gascoigne’s _Notes of Instruction_, and might have been\r\nas interesting as the _De Vulgari Eloquio_. A treatise on _Latin\r\nRhythms_ by Prudentius might, in its different way, have had an interest\r\nwhich is difficult to parallel by anything modern in actual existence.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Ages, however, were constrained to grapple with their problem\r\nas it arose. They had, as we have seen, been constant to _Artes Poeticæ_\r\ndealing with Latin: at last they had begun to face the more difficult\r\nquestion, how to construct and regulate their own growing vernacular\r\nprosody. No doubt, in these latter attempts, the mechanical\r\nprescriptions of the Provençal and French _Arts_ appear more frequently\r\nthan the philosophical-scientific consideration of poetical capacities\r\nvisible in the _De Vulgari_; but there is no reasonable fault to find\r\nwith this. Nor can it be reasonably contested that the extreme variety,\r\nlicence, and (if any one likes the word) irregularity of the greater\r\nmodern prosodies have given wider range to individual poetical\r\ndevelopment than was allowed by the prosodies of the ancients. Here, as\r\nelsewhere, uniformity rather than variety was probably the aim, and is\r\ncertainly the achievement, of the Classics. For one individual and all\r\nbut inimitable thing, like the Æschylean modulation of the chorus (so\r\ndifferent from the grave but less throbbing music of Sophocles, and from\r\nthe Euripidean tune) or like the Lucretian Hexameter, we find a dozen\r\nresemblances; and, with elaborate combinations like the Alcaic or\r\nSapphic, the result is, as in the parallel case of our Spenserian, or\r\nthe Jonson-Herbert-_In Memoriam_ quatrain with enclosed rhyme, mainly\r\nuniform. But the greater or less licence of equivalent substitution in\r\nthe staple English lines—the octosyllable and decasyllable, for\r\ninstance—admits of the impression of a singular personal stamp, and,\r\nunless rejected by the mistake of the individual or the moment, has\r\nrarely failed to produce it.\r\n\r\nStill one returns, and must necessarily return, to the admission that,\r\nto justify the claims here put forward as to the critical importance of\r\nthe Middle Ages, one cannot go to their own explicit and deliberate\r\nexercises in criticism. To apply Johnson’s not quite inspired remark on\r\nFielding and Richardson, they neither did, nor in all probability could,\r\nexplain the mechanism of the timepiece. But they told the time of day\r\nwith unerring accuracy; and their records of it have been neglected, and\r\nwill be neglected by succeeding ages, only at the peril—which has\r\nalready sometimes led to actual shipwreck—of miscalculating the whole\r\nliterary reckoning. When the critics of the Renaissance, followed more\r\nor less blindly by those of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,\r\neither contumeliously or in the sheer generous mistake of desire for\r\nimprovement, turned their backs, as far as they could, on the products\r\nof Mediæval literature, they not merely shut themselves out from a vast\r\nvolume of delight, they not only mistook disastrously the value of many\r\nindividuals, but they recklessly deprived themselves once more—and with\r\nfar less excuse and greater loss than had resulted from the similar\r\nrefusal of the later Greeks—of an inestimable opportunity for\r\nComparison. And so they once more barred for themselves the one gate and\r\nhighway to really universal criticism of literature.\r\n\r\nFor the great, the immense, value of the literature of the Middle Ages\r\nconsists in its freshness and independence, and the consequent fashion\r\nin which new literary bents and faculties of the human mind were\r\nmanifested. The Greeks had, at any rate so far as we know, neither the\r\nadvantage nor the disadvantage of any precedent literature before them;\r\nbut their spirit of theory and of philosophising, while it helped to\r\nconcentrate and intensify the peculiar virtue of their product, tended\r\nalso to narrow and stereotype their range. Latin suffered from the\r\ndouble drawback of system and model. And modern literature itself has\r\nnot, with all its achievements, been able to free itself from the\r\ninevitable consequences of ancestry. It is a great deal too literary; it\r\nhas, in almost all cases, the obsession of the library, and the printed\r\nbook, upon it. It is deliberate, preoccupied, interested; it has all\r\nsorts of cants, prejudices of education or emancipation, purposes,\r\nreminiscences, unacknowledged and often unconscious trammels and\r\ntwitches. Its fountains are very rarely of living water; they are fed\r\nfrom carefully constructed and collected reservoirs, if not by positive\r\ndistillation from the great sea of older literature.\r\n\r\nNow, with all their slavish docility, all their writing in schools and\r\ngroups and batches, all their adoption of tags and texts, the Middle\r\nAges and their literature present a spectacle which is exactly the\r\nreverse of this. The authors have the appearance of following; they are\r\nreally straying, each at the dictation of his own tastes and instincts\r\nonly. You may as well try to teach a cat to do anything in any but her\r\nown way as a mediæval writer. When he copies a Romance, he will change\r\nthe names if he does nothing else: but probably he will do much else,\r\nwriting it in sixains if his model is in couplets, in decasyllabics if\r\nhis original is octosyllabic, and so forth. Nothing shall induce him to\r\nkeep historical distinctions or philosophical differences. His hero[614]\r\nshall be as beautiful as “Paris of Troy, _or_ Absalom, _or_ Partenopex”;\r\nhis story of Alexander shall blend sober history and the wildest\r\nfiction, with a coolness which is only not reckless because it does not\r\nsee anything to reck. Formal restrictions of the minor kind, prosodic\r\nand other, he will observe devoutly, because they come naturally to him\r\nand are of his own devising; but any restrictions of literary theory he\r\nutterly ignores. His Muse will wear no stays, though she does not\r\ndisdain ornaments.\r\n\r\nFootnote 614:\r\n\r\n  As is actually the case with Floire or Florice, the lover of\r\n  Blanchefleur.\r\n\r\nThe reward of this obedience to Nature was signal. In the first place\r\nthe Middle Ages created, or practically created, the STORY. Of course\r\nthere were stories before; of course the _Odyssey_ would be the best\r\nstory in the world if, of the main elements of Romance—Passion and\r\nMystery—one were a little more developed, and is almost the best story\r\nin the world as it is. Of course there are capital _fabliaux_ in\r\nHerodotus, fine apologues in Plato, good things of other kinds\r\nelsewhere. But the ancients not only hampered themselves by almost\r\nalways telling their longer stories in verse, but seldom knew how to\r\nmanage them in verse or prose. The _Iliad_ is such a bad story that it\r\nhas tempted the profanity of those who would make it not one but a dozen\r\nstories; the _Æneid_ is a story, dull _à dormir debout_ as such, with\r\nsome good rambling and fighting, a great descent to Hades, a capital\r\nboxing-match, not a bad regatta, and a famous but borrowed episode of\r\npassion. Out of Herodotus, till we come to the very verge of the\r\nclassical period with Apuleius and Lucian, it is almost impossible to\r\nfind a Greek, quite impossible to find a Roman, who knows how to tell a\r\nstory at all. The exquisite substance of mythology receives no due\r\nhonour from the story-teller as such. Read Ovid (who had as much of the\r\nstory-telling spirit in him as any ancient except Herodotus), and then\r\nturn to what is often the mere doggerel and jargon of the mediæval Latin\r\nstory-tellers in prose and verse. The gift, no matter whether it came\r\nfrom the East or from the West, from the North or from the South, from\r\nthe Heaven above or the earth beneath, or rose a new Aphrodite from the\r\nAtlantic sea, is here and is not there.\r\n\r\nWithout this gift of story-telling there could not have appeared—though\r\nit would not by itself have been enough to produce—the greater gift of\r\nthe Romance. It would be as unnecessary as it would be foolish to enter\r\nhere into the secular and truceless war as to the origin, the nature,\r\nand so forth of this famous thing. It is sufficient to observe, once\r\nmore, that the thing is here and is not there, except almost by\r\naccident. And the gift of the Romance—in that wide historical sense in\r\nwhich it could be, and was, in the Middle Ages applied to almost every\r\nmanner of subject—was a gift to literature so inestimable that perhaps\r\nno other has ever quite equalled it. At once, with that nonchalance\r\n(they called it _nonchaloir_) in which no time has ever equalled these\r\nAges, they swept away the Doctrine of the Subject, with all the cants\r\nand heresies which pullulate round its undoubtedly noble articles of\r\noriginal faith. Romance was perfectly prepared to deal with any subject,\r\nfrom religion to stag-hunting, from chronology to love. It depended no\r\ndoubt on the individual craftsman whether the result was good or bad;\r\nbut the method has, in the right hands, triumphed over the most\r\nintractable materials, added charm to the most commonplace, made the\r\nmost grotesque acceptable. Could anything be thinner and more ordinary\r\nthan the subject of _Floire et Blanchefleur_? Can anything be more\r\ncharming, not merely than its most perfect outcome in _Aucassin et\r\nNicolette_, but even than the diffuser and less happily phrased\r\nverse-forms? In the Arthurian Legend the success is greater still.\r\nRomance takes a dim personality, and a handful of cacophonous\r\nplace-names, out of a suspicious compilation of pseudo-history, and\r\nspins it, in a single lifetime, into a story the most elaborate, the\r\nmost artful, the most variedly interesting, the fullest of meaning (if\r\nmen _must_ have meaning) in the whole literary world.\r\n\r\nEven to Dante it did not occur to subject the methods and the results of\r\nthis new and potent kind to such an examination as that which Aristotle\r\nhad partly given to the older literature. Nor, at that time and in those\r\ncircumstances, was even Dante likely to have led such an inquiry to a\r\ngood end. The Middle Ages, while consciously abandoning, almost or\r\naltogether, the old aim at Action, had not arrived at the modern command\r\nof Character. They worked at and by mediate things—Incident, Atmosphere,\r\nDescription, Manners, Passion—and they made all these and others\r\nsubserve a Romantic Unity of plot which, instead of being circular like\r\nthe Classical Unity, was calculated for indefinite prolongation, not\r\nmerely in straight line, but after the manner of a tree, with branches\r\nand inarchings skyward, earthward, and horizontal. The scheme admitted\r\nadornments of various kinds, which must have been difficult if not\r\nimpossible to reconcile with the more sober and exacting classical\r\nmodel. It permitted a much greater indulgence of the resort to the\r\nmethods of other arts, especially painting, than classical literature\r\nhad, until its latest days, thought proper. It paid very little\r\nattention to mere probability. All these points invited the comparative\r\ncritic, but they did not find him. In three respects, however, the\r\ndifference between classical and mediæval Imitation or Representation\r\nwas almost more striking than in any other, and all of these presented\r\nthe most tempting opportunities for criticism. These were the attitude\r\nof the new literature to Religion, its attitude to the passion of Love,\r\nand its use of an implement which, though by no means unknown to\r\nClassical literature, had been more sparingly used therein, the method\r\nof Allegory.\r\n\r\nOn the first point it would be very easy to enlarge beyond the widest\r\ntoleration of this treatise; it is here only necessary to point out how\r\ndelicate, and how important, are the new duties prescribed to the critic\r\nof mediæval literature in regard to it. The “blinded Papist” view (which\r\nmakes itself felt even in some observations of such a man as Scott now\r\nand then) may not be so common as it once was, but it is not entirely\r\nobsolete. And it may be doubted whether that to which it has given\r\nplace—a philosophical pity, contemptuous or sympathising, for\r\n“superstition” generally—is not even more hampering, while there can be\r\nno doubt of the hamper imposed on the yet earlier Renaissance by the\r\nsuperior contempt which it felt for mediæval childishness and ignorance.\r\nIn this literature, and in the romantic branch of it more particularly,\r\nallowance has to be made at every moment, in every respect and\r\ncondition, for the omnipresence of an elaborate creed which nobody\r\ndoubted, with which everybody indeed was so saturated and familiar that\r\nhe could jest with it and at it, as one jests with and at a best-beloved\r\nand best-known person and friend. It supplies subject, it affects\r\ntreatment, it colours phrase and image. Although it is very easy to\r\nunderrate the amount of actual religious feeling in antiquity, yet this\r\nfeeling, at its noblest and sincerest, was unquestionably of an entirely\r\ndifferent character from that of the “Ages of Faith.” Take, at their\r\nbest and strongest, the sincere fetichism of the ancient equivalent of\r\nthe “charcoal-burner,” the beautiful mythology of the poet, the sublime\r\nmysticism of the Platonist, and the exalted if slightly Pharisaical\r\nmorality of the better Stoic—combine them with all the art of the\r\nstudent of development. But you will not succeed in making anything in\r\nthe least like the creed of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, with\r\nChrist, or rather with the Virgin and the Devil, fighting perpetually\r\nfor Mansoul, with Angels and Deadly Sins under their command, with a\r\nmiracle possible at every moment, Death and Fortune ruling affairs\r\nsubject to, but not always interfered with by, the higher influences,\r\nthe Sacraments to be resorted to at will or neglected at peril,\r\nPurgatory to be faced or anticipated and won through, Hell or Heaven for\r\nfinal goal. It is almost impossible to allow too much in degree (though\r\nit is extremely possible to allow wrongly in kind) for the influence\r\nwhich this ever-present set of thoughts, beliefs, feelings, which was\r\nabsent from antiquity and present in the Middle Ages, had upon the\r\nliterary utterance of the latter. The unnatural gloom and the\r\nhalf-inarticulate gaiety which have been discovered in this literature\r\n(the latter at least as truly as the former), its occasional\r\nirrationality, as we are pleased to call it (perhaps “irrationalism”\r\nwould be a better word), its shuddering attraction for the horrible and\r\nloathsome, its delight in dream, its quaint and almost flighty\r\nrevulsions and contrasts—all are due to this.\r\n\r\nEqually a commonplace, and yet still more important to, and still more\r\nneglected by, criticism, is the attitude of the Middle Ages to\r\nLove—which is very mainly conditioned by their attitude to Religion. The\r\nnot infrequent, though very idle, debate as to whether the Venus of\r\nchivalry was Urania or Pandemos is, of course, best avoided by the frank\r\nacknowledgment that she was (as indeed Her Divinity always has been)\r\nboth. The distinction from antiquity, and its influence upon literature,\r\ndo not lie in the least in this direction, or in the fact of the\r\nmixture, but in its nature and character. With exceptions, of course,\r\nthe tone of antiquity in literature, as to love and to its objects, is\r\neither the tone of slightly unreal philosophising, or the tone of the\r\nnaughty story, or that of half-paraded, half-confessing contempt. The\r\ntwo former require no treatment here; the latter is important. Love and\r\nits objects are, to an average serious man of letters of the Classics\r\nwhen not a subject for conventional escapades, a rather regrettable\r\nincident attached to humanity, something not in the least _spoudaion_,\r\nsomething only not among the _parerga_ of life because it is almost\r\nimpossible to avoid them, something useful, not unpleasant, rather\r\nbetter than a constitutional or a bath, but affording a much less worthy\r\nemployment than talking in a porch, or declaiming in a school. This is\r\nundeniably the average attitude of the average man of letters of old.\r\nThat of his mediæval brother need hardly be described; but its causes\r\ncome within our view. You have to reckon, not merely with the cult of\r\nthe Virgin, as has often been done, but with the whole Christian\r\n(especially mediæval-Christian) theory of morals and of sin. Why excite\r\nyourself about actions indifferent at best, always rather below the\r\nattention of a serious man, and at worst leading to unpleasant and\r\ndubious consequences? Excitement becomes easy when the consequence of a\r\nmoment’s guilty indulgence may be the Inferno for eternity. Nay, from a\r\nless purely selfish point of view there are reasons enough.\r\nImagination—the real Imagination of Apollonius or Philostratus, not the\r\nmere image-furnishing faculty of the ancients generally—had “come to\r\ntown,” and brought a transformed Love with her. The sense of mystery, of\r\nmiracle, of the invisible, grafted itself upon the strongest of the\r\nmerely physical instincts, and the result pervaded literature. The\r\ntrumpery subject, proper for comedy, for epic episodes, for a carefully\r\nkept-under seasoning to tragedy, for light trifles, became, with\r\nReligion, the subject of nearly all poetry, and of not a little prose,\r\nand made its influence felt in all manner of ways. It even, although the\r\nMiddle Age was confessedly not strong in character, paved the way to\r\nthat last grace, thanks to the fancy of the time for rehandling the same\r\nsubjects and persons. Trace Briseis-Briseida, a fashion-plate in Dares,\r\na slave-girl in Benoist, to the Cressida of Chaucer and of Henryson;\r\ntrace Guanhumara, a handsome Roman damsel of good family and nothing\r\nmore, down to the complex woman and Queen of the complete _Lancelot_,\r\nand you will see how character-drawing arose.\r\n\r\nBut undoubtedly one of the greatest, and perhaps the most\r\ncharacteristic, of the influences of the love-motive on literature, and\r\nthe development of literary methods through this and other motives, is\r\nthe mediæval use of Allegory. The thing, of course, is not new—nothing\r\never is in the strict sense. It may actually have dwelt upon the banks\r\nof Nile: it certainly did on those of Ilissus and Tiber. But the very\r\nstrong prominence of it in the Scriptures, and in ecclesiastical\r\nwritings generally, could not fail to develop it in the younger\r\nvernaculars; and its alliance (a dangerous one no doubt, but a real and\r\nnatural) with Imagination could not long be missed. Many ingenious and\r\nindustrious hands have traced its origin from Homer to Claudian, and\r\nfrom Claudian to the _Romance of the Rose_. How it thence coloured all\r\nliterature is sufficiently known. But no critic has even yet exhausted,\r\nnor are a hundred critics likely to exhaust, the subtle and innumerable\r\nramifications of its literary influence and manifestations.\r\n\r\nThese things and others showed themselves no doubt mainly in the\r\nRomance—the chief, the most characteristic, and, so far as anything is\r\noriginal, the most original of the literary products of the Middle Ages.\r\nBut the Romance was far indeed from being the only new development in\r\nliterary morphology that the period had to offer. Until nearly its\r\nclosing time, no great change or advance was made in History, though the\r\nartificial speech, which ancient exaggerations of oratory had imposed on\r\nthe historian, was to a great extent dropped, and the purview of the\r\nwriter was insensibly widened in other directions. But the immense\r\ncultivation of the short tale—first in verse, then in prose—was a matter\r\nclosely connected, but by no means identical, with the progress of\r\nRomance itself. And, as in another matter glanced at above, the restless\r\ncharacter of the time, and its constant tendency to reproduce with\r\nslight alteration, had, here also, a great influence. In all these\r\nalterations the arts and crafts of the future novelist and dramatist\r\nwere insensibly exercising themselves. But the drama itself demands at\r\nleast a glance. That the modern play owes nothing to the mediæval is the\r\nfoolishest of critical delusions; but it would hardly be rash to say\r\nthat the mediæval drama owes nothing to the ancient. When the horror\r\nwith which (for not such very bad reasons) the Church regarded stage\r\nplays altogether had been a little relaxed, the natural and the\r\nartificial dramas followed entirely different lines. Hroswitha’s work,\r\nand _Christus Patiens_, and the rest, have absolutely nothing to do with\r\nMiracle or Mystery or Farce, which are the romance and the short story\r\nthrown, according to the natural histrionic bent of man, into\r\npresentation by personages instead of by continuous narration. And the\r\nlaws which they developed, and by which they helped the greater and more\r\ngenuine modern drama to be what it was, were natural likewise, and had\r\nnothing to do with Aristotle or with Horace, with Plato or with\r\nAristophanes.\r\n\r\nThis would by itself have sufficed to give the new drama a very\r\ndifferent nature, and therefore a most important comparative critical\r\ninfluence, when contrasted with the old. The Greek drama (which the\r\nRoman more or less slavishly copied) may have had its infancies; but we\r\npossess it only in its riper age. Nor is it even possible that these\r\ninfancies, granting their existence, could have shown anything like the\r\nmultiform influences which betray themselves in the mediæval drama. Both\r\nmay have been originally liturgic; but there is such an infinite\r\ndifference in the complexity of the liturgies! Both may have been\r\npreceded by epic and perhaps lyric; but in other respects the Greek\r\ndrama was certainly among the first—as the mediæval drama was nearly the\r\nlast—to take rank among literary kinds. And these differences, putting\r\nothers aside, would have accounted, in great part, for the singularly\r\nundulating and diverse character which (in company, no doubt, with an\r\nimperfection as great as the diversity) distinguished the new drama from\r\nthe splendid, but somewhat narrow, perfection of the old. Even in the\r\nstock types, in the Vices and Fools of the new form, there was little or\r\nnothing of the fixed character of the Roman—we can say little of the\r\nGreek—\"comedy of art.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, not merely in more kinds of literature than one, but in every\r\nkind of literature, with hardly a single exception, the Middle Ages\r\nprovided their successors with the material for an entirely new Calculus\r\nof Critical Variations—for a complete redressing of whatever positive\r\nerrors or mere relative gaps had existed in the older criticism, by\r\nreason of the absence of opportunities for observation.\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nNor can it be regarded as any great drawback to the critical position of\r\nthe Renaissance to which we are coming—and the grounds and data of which\r\nit is desirable to survey in advance, by way of retrospect over the\r\ncontents of the present volume—that this immense provision of new\r\ncritical material was not accompanied by many, or indeed (with the one\r\ngreat exception, soon to be known, but to be hardly in the least heeded)\r\nany, accomplished exercises in critical method. For these, as has been\r\npointed out, were not likely to have been very good; and, good or bad,\r\nthey were nearly sure to have been neglected, or to have done positive\r\nharm by way of mere reaction. Moreover, it was easily and perfectly open\r\nto the Renaissance to create for itself in this department. By its\r\nrecovery—no longer in half-measure, and less than half-light, but in\r\nfull—of the literature of antiquity, it had been put in possession, not\r\nmerely of the other great masses of literary material, but of quite\r\nadmirable examples of critical method itself. Quintilian, Horace,\r\nCicero, the Greek and Latin Rhetoricians, were among its inherited\r\npossessions, and it had certainly had the _Poetics_, though little\r\nattention had for a long time been paid to them. But they were soon put\r\nbefore it afresh: and, what is more, the discovery of Longinus also was\r\nsoon made. Horace, with his arbitrary rules, and his enforced, but\r\nprobably not at all unwelcome, abstinence from any dry exhibition of\r\nmaterial and examples, was no doubt, with all his merits, a very\r\ndangerous mentor. But with Aristotle, Quintilian, and Longinus at hand\r\nas preceptors of method, and practically all then existing literature,\r\nclassical and mediæval, at hand as storehouse of matter, a man of the\r\nmid-sixteenth century had only himself to blame if he did not hit upon\r\nat least the main and general articles of the critical Catholic Faith.\r\nHe might not anticipate the magnificent and almost unbelievable new\r\ndevelopments of literature which were actually to take place, in the\r\nthree western countries of Europe, within a very few years; but he would\r\nhave been none the worse critic for that. The critic is, by his\r\nprofession, not in the least bound to be a prophet. But he had every\r\ndocument necessary to correct the chief shortcomings of the ancients, to\r\nenlarge the classification of literary kinds, to rearrange the nature,\r\ndegrees, and methods of the literary assault on the senses and the soul.\r\n\r\nIt would be undue anticipation to discuss what he did instead of this;\r\nor to give in detail the positive influences which worked upon him in\r\npreferring his actual alternative. But it is matter of undoubted history\r\nthat he did not do what he might have done, and it is matter of\r\nrelevance here to give the reasons, as far as they are retrospective,\r\nwhy he did not do it.\r\n\r\nTo a considerable extent the explanation, and if not the justification,\r\nthe excuse, of his failure lie in a well-known and constantly repeated\r\nphenomenon which, on this particular occasion, showed itself with\r\nunusual, indeed with elsewhere unexampled, distinctness and power. Every\r\nage and every individual (it has been said often, but can never be said\r\ntoo often), unless it or he is a mere continuation of predecessors, is\r\nunjust to these predecessors. Examples are not necessary; the merest\r\nmoment’s thought will supply them in profusion. But there were numerous\r\nand powerful conditions and forces which made this injustice certain to\r\nbe more violent and more lasting here than in almost any other case. No\r\nknown “dispensation” exists historically of anything like the same\r\nlength, the same intensity, the same uniformity as that which\r\ncharacterises in all things, and certainly not least in matters\r\nliterary, the thousand years of the Middle Age at its widest stretch.\r\nAnd this would of itself be sufficient to bring about a reaction of\r\ncorresponding violence and duration. But to this general aspect of the\r\nwhole period must be added the particular aspect of its final stage.\r\nExcept in Italy (which had never been intensely or characteristically\r\nmediæval, and which had practically ceased to be so, in any sense not\r\nexternal, soon after Dante’s time) the fifteenth century had been a\r\nperiod of decadence, or of transition, or of stagnation, in almost every\r\nEuropean country. It is possible, though it is not probable, that minds\r\nin which the critical spirit was reawakening might have taken a juster\r\nview of things if the fresh examples then before them, to be compared\r\nwith Homer, Lucretius, Thucydides, had been Dante, Chaucer, Froissart.\r\nBut there was some excuse for an indignant pooh-poohing of the mere\r\npossibility of comparison, when the persons, to be compared immediately\r\nwith the great writers of antiquity, were the dreary and bombastic\r\n_rhétoriqueurs_ of the French, or the shambling versifiers of the\r\nEnglish, fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe Renaissance, moreover, was likely to be led wrong by that constant\r\ndelusion of matter, that fatal attraction towards the subject, which, as\r\nthis _History_ endeavours to show, has led Criticism wrong a dozen times\r\nfor once that it has led her right. The mediæval forms of literature\r\nwere identified, allied, in fact saturated, with certain beliefs and\r\nmodes of thought—scholastic philosophy, Catholic religion, aristocratic\r\npolitics. To the pure Platonist on the one hand and the thorough-going\r\nAristotelian on the other, to the reformer on the one hand and the\r\nfreethinker on the other, to the democrat on the one hand and the\r\nbeliever in Machiavellian statecraft on the other, all these things were\r\npartly horrible, partly idiotic, altogether to be shaken off and\r\nrefused. The natural, but in the main irrational and frivolous,\r\nweariness of an old fashion was supplemented, inspirited, made far more\r\nvehement and dangerous, by the deliberate and reasoned, if not\r\nreasonable, antipathy to, and revolt against, an old faith. It has been\r\nacknowledged already that the _Morte d’Arthur_ would have fared as badly\r\nwith Augustine as it did with Ascham; but the moral provocation would\r\nnot have been aggravated to Augustine, as it was perhaps to Ascham,\r\ncertainly to more thorough-going Protestants than he, by the distinct\r\nconnection between the Graal Legend and the doctrine of\r\nTransubstantiation.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Renaissance indulged itself, and left to its\r\nsuccessors, the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (different as they\r\nwere from itself in many ways), an amount of “unintelligent scorn” of\r\nthe past which, if it does credit to nothing else, does credit at least\r\nto the vigour and intensity of the time. Sometimes this scorn was vocal\r\nand argumentative, as in Ascham himself, in Du Bellay, in others. More\r\noften, and with a subtler mischief still, it was silent, implicit,\r\napparently exchanged for mere negligence. The childish things were\r\nsimply put away, despatched to the lumber-room, and left there. And it\r\nwas this negligence, rather than the scorn, which did harm to the\r\ncriticism of the periods that followed. It does not do the critic\r\nunmitigated harm to take the wrong side now and then; he exercises\r\nhimself at his weapons, he can acquire dexterity in them, and very often\r\n(Dryden is a notable example) he teaches himself orthodoxy in the very\r\nact of fighting for the heterodox. But when he allows himself to ignore,\r\ngreat gulfs or smaller pits open for him at once. That is what he can\r\nnever afford to do; that is the cause of all the errors which have beset\r\nhis kind, from the beginning of critical things until the present day.\r\nOne of the most excellent and admirable of librarians once replied to a\r\nchildish question of the present writer, “What do you do with the\r\nrubbish?” “It is rather difficult, you see, to know what is rubbish\r\nto-day; and quite impossible to know what will be rubbish to-morrow.”\r\nAnd while this is more especially true of the critic, who can with\r\nsafety pass nothing, at least unexamined, as rubbish, his case is more\r\ndangerous still than that of the librarian, who has but to arrange what\r\nhe has got in orderly fashion, and prepare plentiful shelves for what is\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\nWith the critic, as we have seen, it is different. He must always\r\ngeneralise at his peril, and subject to the upset of his generalisations\r\nby fresh discoveries. But he can at least be careful of the “without\r\nprejudice,” and he can at least neglect nothing that is within his\r\nreach, in his processes of observation and comparison. The earlier Greek\r\ncritics erred, as we have seen, partly because of a necessary and\r\nguiltless deprivation. But their venial sin became more of a mortal one,\r\nwhen they not only assumed that there was nothing save what they knew in\r\nGreek, but deliberately ignored the opportunities, not of sovereign but\r\nof considerable efficacy, which were offered them by Latin. The Latin\r\ncritics erred, partly by the same assumption, and partly by converting\r\nthe despite of Latin into a slavish and unintelligent adoration of\r\nGreek, and not always the best Greek. The Middle Age was innocent, as\r\nhardly indulging in criticism at all. But the Renaissance critics at\r\nfirst committed, and to far too great an extent handed on, a combination\r\nof the sins of their classical teachers. They assumed the stationary\r\nstate of literary kinds and qualities, as both Greeks and Romans had\r\ndone; they adulated classical literature, like the Romans in regard to\r\nGreek; they despised mediæval literature, like the Greeks in relation to\r\nLatin. And, as we shall see, they had their reward.\r\n\r\nBut I should be sorry to end not merely a chapter but a Book, not merely\r\na Book but a volume, without a _caveat_ against possible misconstruction\r\nof the words “fault,” “error,” “sin,” “mischief,” “misfortune,” and the\r\nlike, which have just been used, not merely in this context, but\r\nthroughout the volume itself. There have been, I believe, persons\r\nunfortunate enough to be dissatisfied with the moral and physical\r\ngovernment of the universe—persons who have sadly pronounced it “a crank\r\nmachine” in many ways. These things are not my trade. But, in matters\r\nliterary, I must plead guilty to being something of an optimist. Not\r\nthat I think all literature good—that is not precisely the conclusion to\r\nwhich a thirty years’ practice of criticism brings one. In the critical\r\nland, as in the _pays des amours_, the shore where one always loves is a\r\nshore of which it must be said that _on ne la connaît guère_. There is,\r\nindeed, a certain critical delight in reading even the worst books, so\r\nlong as they are positively and not merely negatively bad—but that is\r\nanother matter.\r\n\r\nThe point on which I am contented to be called a critical Pangloss is\r\nthis, that I have hardly the slightest desire to alter—if I could do so\r\nby the greatest of all miracles, that of retro-active change—the\r\nliterary course of the world. No doubt things might have been better\r\nstill—one may there agree with the pious divine on his strawberry. But\r\none may also be perfectly contented with the actual result. I have\r\nendeavoured to show that, however we may feel bound to pronounce Greek\r\nliterature incomplete in this or that department, and still more Greek\r\ncriticism imperfect in its assumptions and of questionable adequacy in\r\nits methods, yet Greek criticism was the criticism which was wanted, to\r\nregister and to preserve the qualities which have made Greek literature\r\nperhaps the most indispensable possession among the now goodly list of\r\nthe literatures of the world. I have endeavoured further to show that\r\nthe two conflicting strains or streams in Latin criticism correspond, in\r\na manner “necessary and voluptuous and right,” on the one hand, to the\r\nordered correctness and _venustas_ which are the notes of the Latin\r\nspirit on its Academic side; on the other, to the under-current of\r\nhalf-barbaric gorgeousness which there, as elsewhere, now and again\r\nasserted itself—with no small benefit to the world’s letters.\r\n\r\nAnd so, also, in this chapter and the Book which precedes it, I have\r\ntried to show that the immense provision of new kinds of literature by\r\nthe Middle Age, side by side with its almost total abstinence from\r\ncriticism, was the best thing that could have happened. Nor is it\r\nimpossible that, if we are able to pursue the inquiry, we shall find\r\nthat the new differentia of the Renaissance period and that which\r\nfollowed to the Romantic revival—the curious fact that almost all its\r\ncriticism went one way, while almost all its best creation went dead in\r\nthe teeth of that criticism—has again worked mainly if not wholly for\r\ngood. But this is for the future. _Si laisse ore à tant li contes à\r\nparler!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n Academics, the, 66.\r\n Acatalepsy (the Pyrrhonist doctrine of agnosticism), 64.\r\n Accius or Attius, L.

He is mentioned by name on the page itself.\r\n    “Mimes, the prose Greek”, is not mentioned either in a note on p.\r\n    21, nor on p. 22 itself.\r\n    “Plato” is not mentioned in any note on p. 145.\r\n\r\n                                 Notes\r\n\r\n49.20: The word ‘curial’ on p. 49 (“a =curial= instance of that\r\n      commentatorial _lues_...”) seems odd. ‘Crucial’ may have been\r\n      intended, but seems more likely to have been ‘curious’.\r\n\r\n                              Corrections\r\n\r\nErrors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and\r\nare noted here.
