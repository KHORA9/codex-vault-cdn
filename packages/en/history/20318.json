Am I a miserable\r\n     egotist, possessed of stupid vanity? It matters not, but of this I\r\n     feel positive; yes, as positive as that I live, and this is, my\r\n     \"Tristan and Isolde,\" with which I am now consumed, does not find\r\n     its equal in the world's library of music. Oh, how I yearn to hear\r\n     it; I am feverish; I am worn. Perhaps that causes me to be agitated\r\n     and anxious, but my \"Tristan\" has been finished now these three\r\n     years and has not been heard. When I think of this I wonder whether\r\n     it will be with this as with \"Lohengrin,\" which now is thirteen\r\n     years old, and is still dead to me. But the clouds seem breaking,\r\n     they are breaking--I am going to Vienna soon. There they are going\r\n     to give me a surprise. It is supposed to be kept a secret from me,\r\n     but a friend has informed me that they are going to bring out\r\n     \"Lohengrin.\"\r\n\r\n     --_Wagner in a Letter to Praeger_\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD WAGNER\r\n\r\nAbsurd and silly people make jokes about mothers-in-law, stepmothers and\r\nstepfathers--we will none of this. My heart warms to the melancholy\r\nJacques, who dedicated his book to his mother-in-law, \"my best friend,\r\nwho always came when she was needed and never left so long as there was\r\nwork to do.\" Richard Wagner's stepfather was his patient, loving and\r\nloyal friend.\r\n\r\nThe father of Wagner died when the child was six months old. The mother,\r\nscarcely turned thirty, had a brood of seven, no money and many debts.\r\nThere is trouble for you--ye silken, perfumed throng, who nibble\r\ncheese-straws, test the hyson when it is red, and discuss the\r\nheartrending aspects of the servant-girl problem to the lascivious\r\npleasings of a lute!\r\n\r\nBut the widow Wagner was not cast down to earth--she resolved on keeping\r\nher family together, caring for them all as best she could. The\r\nsuggestion from certain kinsmen that the children should be given out\r\nfor adoption was quickly vetoed. The fine spirit of the woman won the\r\nadmiration of a worthy actor, in slightly reduced circumstances, who had\r\nlodgings in the house of the widow. This actor, Ludwig Geyer by name,\r\nloved the widow and all of the brood, and he proposed that they pool\r\ntheir poverty.\r\n\r\nAnd so before Mrs. Wagner had been a widow a twelvemonth they were\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\nIn this marriage Geyer seemed to be moved to a degree by the sentiment\r\nof friendship for his friend, the deceased husband. Geyer was a man of\r\nmany virtues--amiable, hopeful, kind. He had the artistic temperament\r\nwithout its faults. To writers of novels, in search of a very choice\r\ncentral character, Ludwig Geyer affords great possibilities. He was as\r\nhopeful as Triplett and a deal more versatile. The histrionic art\r\nafforded him his income of eleven dollars a week; but painting was his\r\nforte--if he only had time to devote to the technique! Yet all the arts\r\nbeing one he had written a play; he also modeled in clay and sang tenor\r\nparts as understudy to the great Schudenfeldt. Hope, good-cheer and a\r\ndevotion to art were the distinguishing features of Mein Herr Geyer.\r\n\r\nAll this was in the city of Leipzig; but Herr Geyer becoming a member of\r\nthe Court Theater, the family moved to Dresden, where at this time lived\r\none Weber, a composer, who used to walk by the Geyer home and\r\noccasionally stop in for a little rest. At such times one of the\r\nchildren would be sent out with a pitcher, and the great composer and\r\nHerr Geyer would in fancy roam the realm of art, and Herr Geyer would\r\nimpart to Herr Weber valuable ideas that had never been used. The little\r\nboy, Richard, used to cherish these visits of Weber, and would sit and\r\nwatch for hours for the coming of the queer old man in the long gray\r\ncloak.\r\n\r\nThe stork, one fine day, brought Richard a little sister. He was scarce\r\ntwo years older than she. These two sort of grew up together, and were\r\never the special pets of Herr Geyer, who used to take them to the\r\ntheater and seat them on a bench in the wings where they could watch him\r\nlead the assault in \"The Pirate's Revenge.\"\r\n\r\nRichard regarded his stepfather with all the affection that ever a child\r\nhad for its own parent; and until he was twenty-one was known to the\r\nworld as Richard Wilhelm Geyer.\r\n\r\nThe comparison of Ludwig Geyer with Triplett is hardly fair, for Geyer's\r\nfine effervescence and hopeful, rainbow-chasing qualities were confined\r\nto early life.\r\n\r\nAs the years passed Geyer settled down to earnest work and achieved a\r\nconsiderable success both as an actor and as a painter. The unselfish\r\nquality of the man is shown in that his income was freely used to\r\neducate the Wagner children. He was sure that Richard had the germ of\r\nliterary ability in his mental make-up, and his ambition was that the\r\nboy should become a writer. But alas! Geyer did not live long enough to\r\nknow the true greatness of this child he had fostered and befriended.\r\n\r\nUnlike so many musicians Richard was not precocious. He was slow,\r\nthoughtful and philosophic; and music did not attract him so much as\r\nletters. Incidentally he took lessons in music with his other studies,\r\nand his first teacher, Gottlieb Muller, has left on record the statement\r\nthat the boy was \"self-willed and eccentric, and not fluid enough in\r\nspirit to succeed in music.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother of Wagner seems to have been a woman of marked mentality--not\r\nespecially musical or poetic, but possessing a fine appreciation of all\r\ngood things, and best of all, she had commonsense. She very early came\r\nto regard Richard as her most promising child, and before he was ten\r\nyears of age, said to a friend, \"Richard will be able to succeed at\r\nanything he concentrates his mind upon.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth of the remark has often been reiterated. The youth was superb\r\nin his mental equipment--strong, capable, independent. Had he turned his\r\nattention to any other profession, or any branch of art or science, he\r\ncould have probed the problem to its depths, and made his mark upon the\r\nage in which he lived.\r\n\r\nIn height Wagner was a little under size, but his deep chest, well-set\r\nneck, and large, shapely head gave him a commanding look. In physique he\r\nresembled the \"big little men\" like Columbus, Napoleon, Aaron Burr,\r\nAlexander Hamilton and John Bright--men born to command, with ability to\r\ndo the thinking for a nation.\r\n\r\nIt's magnificent to be a great musician, and many musicians are nothing\r\nelse, but it is better to be a man than a musician. Richard Wagner was a\r\nman. Environment forced literature upon his attention: he desired to be\r\na great poet. He wrote essays, stories, quatrains, epics. Chance sent\r\nthe work of Beethoven within his radius, and he became filled with the\r\nmelody of the master. Young men of this type, full of the pride of\r\nyouth, overflowing with energy, search for a something on which to try\r\ntheir steel. Wagner could write poetry, that was sure, and more, he\r\ncould prepare the score and set his words to music. He fell upon the\r\nwork like one possessed--and he was. To his amazement the difficulties\r\nof music all faded away, and that which before seemed like a hopeless\r\ntask, now became luminous before the heat of his spirit.\r\n\r\nNothing is difficult when you put your heart in it.\r\n\r\nThe obstacles to be overcome in setting words to sounds were like a game\r\nof chess--a pleasing diversion. In a month he knew as much of the\r\nscience of music as many men did who had grubbed at the work a lifetime.\r\n\"The finances! Get your principles right and then 'tis a mere matter of\r\ndetail, requiring only concentration--I will arrange it,\" said Napoleon.\r\n\r\nWagner focused on music, yet here seems a good place to say that he\r\nnever learned either to play the piano or to sing. He had to trust the\r\n\"details\" to others. Yet at twenty he led an orchestra. Soon after he\r\nbecame conductor of the opera at Magdeburg.\r\n\r\nIn some months more he drifted to Konigsberg, and there acted as\r\nconductor at the Royal Theater. In the company of this theater was a\r\nyoung woman by the name of Wilhelmina Planer. Wagner got acquainted with\r\nher across the footlights. She was young, comely and all that--they\r\nbecame engaged. Shortly afterwards, one fine moonlight night, in\r\nresponse to her merry challenge, they rang up the \"Dom\" and were\r\nmarried. They got better acquainted afterward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that Wagner's imprudent marriage at the age of twenty-three\r\nhas been much regretted and oft lamented. \"What,\" say the Impressionable\r\nOnes, \"Oh, what could he not have accomplished with a proper mate!\"\r\n\r\nIt is very true that Minna Planer had no comprehension of the genius of\r\nher husband; that her two feet were always flatly planted on earth, and\r\nher head never reached the clouds; and true it is that she was a weary\r\nweight to him for the twenty-five years they lived together. Still men\r\ngrow strong by carrying burdens; and we must remember that Wagner was\r\nwhat he was on account of what he endured and suffered.\r\n\r\nWagner expressed himself in his art, and all great art is simply the\r\nhonest, spontaneous, individual expression of soul-emotion. Had Wagner's\r\nemotions been different he would have produced a totally different sort\r\nof art. That is to say, if Wagner in his youth had loved and wedded a\r\nwoman who was capable of giving his soul peace, we would have had no\r\nWagner; we would have had some one else, and therefore a totally\r\ndifferent expression, or no expression at all. Probably the man would\r\nhave been quite content to be a village Kapellmeister. His life being\r\nreasonably complete, his spirit would not have roamed the Universe\r\ncrying for rest. The ideals of his wife were so low and commonplace that\r\nshe influenced his career by antithesis. His soul was ahungered for the\r\nbread of life, and stones were given him in way of the dull, the ugly,\r\nthe affected, the smug, the ridiculous. Wagner's life was a revolt from\r\nthe ossified commonplace, a struggle for right adjustment--a heart\r\ntragedy. And all this reaching out of the spirit, all the prayers,\r\nhopes, fears and travail of his soul, are told and told again in his\r\npoetry and in his music.\r\n\r\nAll art is autobiography.\r\n\r\nMinna Planer was amiable and kind, but the frantic effort she made at\r\ntimes, in public, to be profound or chic must have touched the great man\r\non the raw. He sought, however, to protect her, and at public gatherings\r\nused to keep very near to her in order that she should not fall into the\r\nclutches of some sharp-witted enemy and be lead on into unseemliness of\r\nspeech. The scoffs of critics and the ready-made gibes and jeers of the\r\nmob were to her gospel truth; her husband's genius was a vagary to be\r\nstoutly endured. So for many years she was inclined to pose as one to be\r\npitied--and so she was. That she suffered at times can not be denied,\r\nyet God is good, and so has put short limit on the sensibilities of the\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nBut Wagner would never tolerate an unkind word spoken of Minna in his\r\npresence, and once rebuked a friend who sought to console him by saying,\r\n\"Never mind, Minna lives her life the best she can, and expresses the\r\nthoughts that come to her--what more do you and I do?\"\r\n\r\nAnd in his later years, when calm philosophy was his, he realized that\r\nMinna Planer had supplied him a stinging discontent, a continued unrest\r\nthat formed the sounding-board on which his sorrow and his hope and his\r\nfaith in the Ideal were echoed forth.\r\n\r\nLove is the recurring motif in all of Wagner's plays. A man and a woman,\r\njoined by God, but separated by unkind condition, play their parts, and\r\nour hearts are made by the Master to vibrate in sympathy with the\r\ncentral idea. Only a broken-hearted man could have conjured forth from\r\nhis soul such couples as these: Senta and the Dutchman, Elizabeth and\r\nTannhauser, Elsa and Lohengrin, Tristan and Isolde, Siegmund and\r\nSieglinde, Walter and Eva, Siegfried and Brunhilde.\r\n\r\nWagner's unhappy marriage forms the keynote of his art. Every opera he\r\nwrote depicts a soul in bonds. From \"The Flying Dutchman\" to \"Parsifal\"\r\nwe are shown the struggle of a strong man with cruel Fate; a reaching\r\nout for liberty and light; the halting between duty and inclination; and\r\nthe endless search for a woman who shall give deliverance through her\r\nabiding love and faith.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll art seems controlled by fad and fashion. No fashion endures, else\r\n'twere not fashion, and in its character the fad is essentially\r\ntransient. Still we need not rail at fashion; it is a form of\r\nperiodicity, and periodicity exists through all Nature. There are day\r\nand night, winter and summer, equinox and solstice, work and rest, years\r\nof plenty and years of famine. Comets return, and all fashions come\r\nback. Keep your old raiment long enough and it will be in style.\r\n\r\nAll things move in an orbit, even theories and religions. Certain forms\r\nof fanaticism come with the centuries--every new heresy is old. All\r\nextremes cure themselves, for when matters get pushed to a point where\r\nthe balance of things is in danger of being disturbed, a Reformer\r\nappears and utters his stentorian protest. This man is always ridiculed,\r\nhooted, reviled, mobbed, and very happy indeed is his fate if he is\r\nhanged, crucified or made to drink of the deadly hemlock; for then his\r\nplace in the affection of men is made secure, sealed with blood, and we\r\nproclaim him liberator or savior. The Piazza Signora is sacred soil\r\nbecause there it was that Savonarola died; John Brown's body lies\r\na-moldering in the grave, but his soul goes marching on; J. Wilkes Booth\r\nlinked his own name with that of Judas Iscariot and made his victim\r\nknown to the Ages as the Emancipator of Men.\r\n\r\nThese strong men, sent at the pivotal points in history, are born out\r\nof a sore need--they are sent from God. Yet strong men always exist, but\r\nit is the needs of the hour that develop and bring them to our\r\nattention. Not always have the Reformers been fortunate in their takings\r\noff--many have lingered out lengthening, living deaths in walled-up\r\ncells. The Bastile, Chillon, London Tower, that prison joined to a\r\npalace by the Bridge of Sighs, and all other such plague-spots of blood\r\nare haunted by the ghosts of infamy. Before the memory of all those who\r\nwrote immortal books behind grated bars we stand uncovered.\r\n\r\nExile has been the lot of many who tried to live for sanity, justice and\r\ntruth when mad riot raged. Dante, Victor Hugo, Prince Kropotkin and\r\nWagner are types to which we turn. Then there is an attenuated form of\r\npersecution known as ostracism, which consists in being exiled at home,\r\nbut of this it is not worth while to speak.\r\n\r\nWagner was a strong, honest man who simply desired to express his better\r\nself. The elements of caution and expediency were singularly lacking in\r\nhis character. These qualities of independence and self-reliance brought\r\nhim into speedy collision with those who stood in the front rank of the\r\nartistic world of his day, and he became a marked man. His offense was\r\nthat he expressed his honest self.\r\n\r\nIn Eighteen Hundred Forty-three, when he appeared upon the scene in\r\nDresden as Hofkapellmeister of the Royal Theater, matters musical were\r\njust about where the stage now is in America. In this Year of Grace,\r\nNineteen Hundred One, the great Shakespeare has been elbowed from the\r\nstage by the author of \"A Texas Steer\"; and where once the haughty\r\nRichard trod the boards, the skirt-dance assumes the center of the stage\r\nand looms lurid like the spirit of the Brocken. Recently a vaudeville\r\n\"turn\" of Hamlet has been presented, where the gravediggers do their\r\ngruesome tasks to ragtime; and on every hand we behold the Lyceum giving\r\nway to the McClure Continuous, Lim.\r\n\r\nWagner abhorred the mere tune for the sake of tune. \"You can not produce\r\nart and leave man out,\" he said. All art must suggest something. Mere\r\nverbal description is not literature: it is only words, words, words; a\r\npicture must be charged with soul, otherwise a photograph would outrank\r\n\"The Angelus.\" Music must be more than jingling tunes and mincing\r\nsounds. And thus we find Wagner at thirty years of age boldly putting\r\nforth \"The Flying Dutchman,\" with music not written for the text, nor\r\ntext written for the music, but words and music created at the same\r\ntime--the melody mirroring forth the soul of the words.\r\n\r\nIn this play Wagner for the first time sacrificed every precedent of\r\nmusical construction and all thought of symmetrical form, in order to\r\nmake the music tell the tale. \"The Flying Dutchman\" is to opera what\r\nWalt Whitman's \"Leaves of Grass\" is to poetry, or Millet's \"Sower\" is\r\nto painting. There is strength, heroic strength, in each of these\r\nmasterpieces I have named, but the \"Dutchman\" needs a listener, \"Leaves\r\nof Grass\" requires a reader who has experienced, and the \"Sower\" demands\r\none who has eyes to see, before its lesson of love and patience and the\r\npathetic truth of endless toil are bodied forth.\r\n\r\nWhitman's book was well looked after by the local Antonius Ash-Box\r\ninspector of the day, its publication forbidden, and the author\r\nincidentally deprived of his clerkship at Washington; Millet did service\r\nas the butt for jokes of artistic Paris, and was dubbed \"The Wild Man\";\r\nWagner's play was hooted off the stage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvery man is but a type representing his class. Of course the class may\r\nbe small and one man may even be its sole living representative: but\r\nWagner had his double in William Morris. These men were brothers in\r\ntemperament, physique, habit of thought and occupation.\r\n\r\nWagner wrote largely on the subjects of Art and Sociology, and made his\r\nappeal for the toiler in that the man should be allowed to share the\r\njoys of Art by producing it. His argument is identical with that of\r\nWilliam Morris; and yet the essays of Wagner were not translated into\r\nEnglish until after Morris had written his \"Dream of John Ball,\" and\r\nMorris did not read German.\r\n\r\nBoth men hark back to a time when Man and Nature were on friendly terms;\r\nwhen the thought, best exemplified by the early Greeks, of the\r\nsacredness of the human body was recognized; when the old medieval\r\nfeeling of helpful brotherhood yet lingered; and the restless misery of\r\ncompetition and all the train of woe, squalor and ugliness that\r\n\"civilization\" has brought were unknown.\r\n\r\nWagner's music is made up of the sounds of Nature conventionalized. You\r\nhear the sighing of the breeze, the song of the birds, the cries of\r\nanimals, the rush of the storm. Wagner's essay, entitled, \"Art and\r\nRevolution,\" is the twin to the lecture, \"Art and Socialism,\" by Morris;\r\nand in the \"Art-Work of the Future,\" Wagner works out at length the\r\nfavorite recurring theme of Morris: work is for the worker, and art is\r\nthe expression of man's joy in his work.\r\n\r\nIn Eighteen Hundred Forty-four, when Morris was ten years of age, Wagner\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n\"I compose for myself; it is just a question between me and my Maker. I\r\ngrow as I exercise my faculties, and expression is a necessary form of\r\nspiritual exercise. How shall I live? Express what I think or feel, or\r\nwhat you feel?\r\n\r\n\"No, I must be honest and sincere. I must, for the need of myself, live\r\nmy own life, for work is for the worker, at the last. Each man must\r\nplease himself, and Nature has placed her approbation on this by\r\nsupplying the greatest pleasure men ever know as a reward for doing good\r\nwork. I hate this fast-growing tendency to chain men to machines in big\r\nfactories and deprive them of all joy in their efforts--the plan will\r\nlead to cheap men and cheap products. I set my face against it and plead\r\nfor the dignity and health of the open air, and the olden time.\"\r\n\r\nThis sort of talk led straight to Wagner's arrest in the streets of\r\nDresden on the charge of inciting a riot; and it was the identical line\r\nof argument that caused the arrest of Morris in Trafalgar Square,\r\nLondon, when he was taken struggling to the station-house.\r\n\r\nWagner was exiled and Morris merely \"cautioned,\" placed under police\r\nsurveillance and ostracized. The difference in time explains the\r\ndifference in punishment. A century earlier and both men would have\r\nforfeited their heads.\r\n\r\nIn all of Wagner's operas the scene is laid at a time when the\r\nfestivals, games and religious ceremonies were touched with the thought\r\nof beauty. Men were strong, plain, blunt and honest. Affectation,\r\nfinesse, pretense and veneer were unknown. Art had not resolved itself\r\ninto the possession of a class of idlers and dilettantes who hired\r\nlong-haired men and fussy girls in Greek gowns to make pretty things for\r\nthem. All worked with their hands, through need, and when they made\r\nthings they worked for utility and beauty. They gave things a beautiful\r\nform, because men and women worked together, and for each other. And\r\nwherever men and women work together we find Beauty. Men who live only\r\nwith other men are never beautiful in their work, or speech, or lives,\r\nneither are women. But at this early time life was largely communal,\r\nnatural, and Art was the possession of all, because all had a share in\r\nits production. Observe the setting of any Wagner opera where Walter\r\nDamrosch has his way and get that flavor of bold, free, wholesome,\r\nhonest Beauty. And yet no stage was ever large enough to quite satisfy\r\nWagner, and all the properties, if he had had his way, would have been\r\nworks of Art, thought out in detail and materialized for the purpose by\r\nhuman hands.\r\n\r\nNow turn to \"The Story of the Glittering Plain,\" \"Gertha's Lovers,\"\r\n\"News From Nowhere\" or \"The Hollow Land,\" by William Morris, and note\r\nthe same stage-setting, the same majesty, dignity and sense of power.\r\nObserve the great underlying sense of joy in life, the gladness of mere\r\nexistence. A serenity and peace pervades the work of both of these men;\r\nthey are mystic, fond of folklore and legend; they live in the open, are\r\ndeeply religious without knowing it, have nothing they wish to conceal,\r\nand are one with Nature in all her many moods and manifestations--sons\r\nof God!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the history of letters there is a writer by the name of Green, who\r\nexists simply because he reviled a contemporary poet by the name of\r\nShakespeare. Green's name is embalmed in immortal amber with that of\r\nRichard Quiney, who wrote a letter to the author of \"The Tempest\"\r\nbegging the favor of a loan of forty pounds.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways of winning fame. Joseph Jefferson has written in\r\nclassic style of Count Johannes and James Owen O'Connor, who played\r\n\"Hamlet\" to large and enthusiastic audiences, behind a wire screen; then\r\nthere was John Doe, who fired the Alexandrian Library, and Richard Roe,\r\nthe man who struck Billy Patterson. Besides these we have the Reverend\r\nObadiah Simmons of Nashville, Tennessee, who, in Eighteen Hundred Sixty,\r\nproduced a monograph proving that negroes had no souls, the value of\r\nwhich work, to be sure, is slightly vitiated when we remember that the\r\nsame arguments were used, in Seventeen Hundred One, by Bishop Volberg,\r\nin showing that women were in a like predicament.\r\n\r\nAnd now Henry T. Finck has compiled a list of more than one hundred\r\nnames of musical critics who placed themselves on record in opposition\r\nto Richard Wagner and his music. Only such men as proved themselves past\r\nmasters in density and adepts in abuse are given a place in this Academy\r\nof Immortals.\r\n\r\nNo writer, musician or artist who ever lived brought down on his head\r\nan equal amount of contumely and disparagement as did Richard Wagner.\r\nTurner, Millet and Rodin have been let off lightly compared with the\r\nfate that was Wagner's; and even the shrill outcry that was raised in\r\nBoston at sight of MacMonnies' Bacchante was a passing zephyr to the\r\nstorm that broke over the head of Wagner in Paris, when, after one\r\nhundred sixteen rehearsals, \"Tannhauser\" was produced.\r\n\r\nThe derisive laughter, catcalls, shouts, hisses and uproar that greeted\r\nthe play were only the shadow of the criticisms that filled the daily\r\npress, done by writers who mistook their own anserine limitations for\r\ninanity on the part of the composer. They scorned the melody they could\r\nnot appreciate, like men who deny the sounds they can not hear; or those\r\nwho might revile the colors they could not distinguish. And worse than\r\nall this, the aristocratic hoodlums refused to allow any one else to\r\nenjoy, and would not tolerate the thought that that which to them was\r\n\"jumbling discord, seven times confounded\" might be a succession of\r\nharmonies to one whose perceptions were more fully developed.\r\n\r\nWagner himself only escaped personal violence by discreetly keeping out\r\nof sight. The result of the Paris experiment was that the poor man lost\r\nnearly a year's time, all of his modest savings were gone, creditors\r\ndogged his footsteps, and the unanimous tone of the critics, for a time,\r\nalmost made him doubt his own sanity. What if the critics were really\r\nright?\r\n\r\nAnd this, we must remember, was in Eighteen Hundred Sixty-one, when\r\nWagner was forty-eight years of age.\r\n\r\nThat even a strong man should doubt his value when he finds a world of\r\nlearned men arrayed against him is not strange. Every man who works in a\r\ncreative way craves approbation. Some one must approve. After the first\r\nfever of ecstasy there comes the reaction, when the pulse beats slow and\r\nthe mind is filled with doubt and melancholy. This desire for approval\r\nis not a weakness--it seems to stand as a natural need of every human\r\nsoul. When the great Peg Woffington played, you remember, she begged Sir\r\nHenry Vane to stand in the wings so as to meet her when she came off the\r\nstage, take her in his arms just for an instant, kiss her on the\r\nforehead and say, \"Well done!\"\r\n\r\nShallow people may smile at such a scene as this, but those who have\r\ndelved in the realm of creative art know this fervent need of a word of\r\nencouragement from One who Understands.\r\n\r\nThe one man who held the mirror up to Nature for Wagner was Franz Liszt.\r\nWere it not for the steadfast love and faith of this noble soul, Wagner\r\nmust surely have fallen by the way. Wagner worked first to please\r\nhimself, and having pleased himself he knew it would please Franz Liszt,\r\nand having pleased Franz Liszt he knew it would please all those as\r\ngreat, noble, excellent and pure in heart as Franz Liszt. To speak to\r\nan audience made up of such as Liszt, and have them approve, was the\r\nsublime dream and hope of Richard Wagner.\r\n\r\nSome of the enemies of Wagner, having placed themselves on record\r\nagainst the man, have sought to make out that Wagner and Liszt often\r\nquarreled, but this canard has now all been exploded. Such another\r\nfriendship between two strong men I can not recall. That of Goethe and\r\nSchiller seems a mere acquaintanceship, and the friendship of Carlyle\r\nand Emerson a literary correspondence with an eye on posterity, as\r\ncompared with this bond of brotherhood that existed between Wagner and\r\nLiszt.\r\n\r\nDuring the ten years of Wagner's exile in Switzerland he received barely\r\nenough from his work in music to support him, and several times he would\r\nhave been in sore need were it not for the \"loans\" made him by Liszt. He\r\ndid not even own a piano, and never heard his scores played, except when\r\nLiszt made a semi-yearly visit. At such times a piano would be borrowed,\r\nand the friends would revel in the new scores, and occasionally talk the\r\nentire night away.\r\n\r\nWhen Liszt would go home after such visits, Wagner would go off on long\r\ntramps, climbing the mountains, lonely and bereft, sure that the mood\r\nfor high and splendid work would never come again. Then some morning the\r\nmist would roll away, the old spirit would come back, and he would apply\r\nhimself with all the intense fire and burning imagination of which his\r\nspirit was capable.\r\n\r\nWhen the score was done it was sent straight to Liszt, before the ink\r\nwas dry.\r\n\r\nThe \"Lohengrin\" manuscript was sent along in parts, and Liszt was the\r\nfirst man to interpret it. On one such occasion we find Liszt writing:\r\n\"Your 'Walkure' has arrived--and gladly would I sing to you with a\r\nthousand voices your 'Lohengrin Chorus'--a wonder, a wonder! Dearest\r\nRichard, you are surely a divine man, and my highest joy is to follow\r\nyou in your flight and be one with you in spirit!\"\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, when the \"Lohengrin Chorus\" first found voice, the\r\nonly auditor was the Princess von Wittgenstein, who added a postscript\r\nto Liszt's letter, thus: \"I wept bitter tears over the scene between\r\nSiegmund and Sieglinde! This is beautiful--like heaven, like earth--like\r\neternity!\" Was ever a woman so blest in privilege--to be the near, dear\r\nfriend of Franz Liszt and hear him play the music of Richard Wagner from\r\nthe manuscript, and then add her precious word of appreciation for the\r\nwork of the weary exile! The quotation given is only a sample of the\r\nmessages that Liszt was constantly sending to his exiled friend. And we\r\nmust understand that at this time Liszt had a world-wide reputation as\r\na composer himself, and was the foremost pianist of his time. And\r\nWagner--Wagner was only an obscure dreamer, with a penchant for erratic\r\nmusic!\r\n\r\nThe \"Lohengrin\" was produced at Weimar under the leadership of Liszt,\r\nbut even his magic name could not make the people believe--the critics\r\nhad their way and wrote it down.\r\n\r\nYet Liszt lived to see the name of Wagner proclaimed as the greatest\r\ncontemporary name in music; and he was too great and good to allow\r\njealousy to enter his great soul. Yet he knew that as a composer his own\r\nwork was quite lost in the shadow of the reputation of his friend. At a\r\nbanquet given in Munich in Eighteen Hundred Eighty-one in honor of\r\nWagner, Liszt said, \"I ask no remembrance for myself or my work beyond\r\nthis: Franz Liszt was the loved and loving friend of Wagner, and played\r\nhis scores with tear-filled eyes; and knew the Heaven-born quality of\r\nthe man when all the world seemed filled with doubt.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong men of worth, no man of his time was more thoroughly hated,\r\ndetested and denounced than Richard Wagner. Before he became an anarch\r\nof art, he was singled out for distinction by royalty and a price was\r\nplaced upon his head. He escaped, and for ten years lived in exile, his\r\nsole offense being that he lifted up his voice for liberty.\r\n\r\nThat is the only thing worth lifting up your voice, or pen, or sword\r\nfor. The men who live in history are the men who have made freedom's\r\nfight--there is no other. These men fought for us, and some of them died\r\nfor us--Socrates, Jesus, Savonarola, John Brown, Lincoln--saviors\r\nall--they died that we might live.\r\n\r\nInstead of dying for us, Wagner lived for us, but he had to run away in\r\norder to do it. There, in exile--in Switzerland--he wrote many of his\r\nmost sublime scores, and these he did not hear played till long years\r\nafter, for although the man could compose, he could not execute. The\r\nmusic was in his brain and he could not get it out at his\r\nfinger-tips--for him the piano was mute. So now and again Franz Liszt\r\nwould come and play for him the scores he had never heard, and tears of\r\njoy would flow down his fine face; then he would stand on his head, walk\r\non his hands and shout for pure gladness.\r\n\r\nAll this, I will admit, was not very dignified.\r\n\r\nOstracism, exile, hatred, and stupid misunderstanding did not suppress\r\nWagner. In his work he is often severe, stern, tragic, but the man\r\nhimself bubbled with good-cheer. He made foolish puns, and routed the\r\nserious ones of earth by turning their arguments into airy jests. If in\r\nthose early days he had been caught and carried in the death-tumbrel to\r\nthe Place of the Skull, he would have remarked with Mercutio, \"This is a\r\ngrave subject.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, public opinion relaxed, and Wagner found his way back to\r\nGermany. He settled at the town of Bayreuth, and very slowly it dawned\r\nupon the thinking few that at Bayreuth there lived a Man.\r\n\r\nAmong the very first who made this discovery was one Friedrich\r\nNietzsche, an idealist, a dreamer, a thinker, and a revolutionary.\r\nNietzsche was an honest man of marked intellect, whose nerves were worn\r\nto the quick by the pretense of the times--the mad race for place and\r\npower--the hypocrisy and phariseeism that he saw sitting in high places.\r\nHe longed to live a life of genuineness--to be, not to seem. And so he\r\nhad wandered here and there, footsore, weary, searching for peace,\r\nscourged forever by the world's displeasure.\r\n\r\nThe trouble was, of course, that Nietzsche didn't have anything the\r\nworld wanted. In the time of the Crusaders, the tired children would ask\r\nat night-time, when the tents were pitched, \"Is this Jerusalem?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the only answer was: \"Jerusalem is not yet! Jerusalem is not yet!\"\r\n\r\nIn Wagner, Nietzsche felt that at last he had found the Moses who would\r\nlead the people out of captivity, into the Promised Land of Celestial\r\nArt.\r\n\r\nNietzsche came and heard the Wagnerian music and was caught as flotsam\r\nin its whirling eddies. He read everything that Wagner had written, and\r\nhaving come within the gracious sunshine of the great man's presence, he\r\nrushed to his garret and in white heat wrote the most appreciative\r\ncriticism of Wagner and his work that has ever, even yet, been penned.\r\nThis booklet, \"Wagner at Bayreuth,\" is a masterpiece of insight and\r\nerudition, written by a man of imagination, who saw and felt, and knew\r\nhow to mold his feelings into words--words that burn. It is a rhapsody\r\nof appreciation.\r\n\r\nArt is more a matter of heart than of head.\r\n\r\nThe book had a wide circulation, helped on, they do say, by the Master\r\nhimself, who confessed that in the main the work rang true.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the book sort of linked these two men, Wagner and\r\nNietzsche. The disciple sat at the feet of the elder man, and vowed he\r\nwould be in literature what Wagner was in music. He gazed on him, fed on\r\nhim, quoted him, waiting in patience for the pearls of thought.\r\n\r\nNow Wagner was a natural man--a natural son of God. He had the desires,\r\nappetites and ambitions of a man. If he voiced great thoughts and wrote\r\ngreat scores, he did these things in a mood--and never knew how. At\r\ntimes he was coarse, perverse, irritable.\r\n\r\nThe awful, serious, sober ways of Nietzsche began to pall on Wagner--he\r\nwould run away when he saw him coming, for Nietzsche had begun to give\r\nadvice about how Wagner should regenerate the race, and also conduct\r\nhimself. Now Richard Wagner had no intention of setting the world\r\nstraight--he wanted to express himself, that was all, and to make enough\r\nmoney so he could be free to come and go as he chose.\r\n\r\nOnce, at a picnic, Wagner climbed a tree and cawed like a crow; then\r\nhooted like an owl; he ate tarts out of a tin dish with a knife; a\r\nlittle later he stood on his head and yelled like a Congo chief. When\r\nNietzsche tearfully interposed, Wagner told him to go and get\r\nmarried--marry the first woman who was fool enough to have him--she\r\nwould relieve him of some of his silliness.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, the great Wagner festival came on, and Bayreuth was\r\nfilled with visitors who had read Nietzsche's book, and bought\r\nexcursion-tickets to Bayreuth.\r\n\r\nWagner was over his ears in work--an orchestra of three hundred players\r\nto manage, new music to arrange, besides the humdrum, but necessary,\r\nwork of feeding and housing and caring for the throng. Of course he did\r\nnot do all the work, but the responsibility was his.\r\n\r\nIn this rush of work, Nietzsche was dropped out of sight--there was no\r\ntime now for long conferences on the Over-Soul and Music of the Future.\r\n\r\nNietzsche was snubbed. He went off to his garret and wrote a scathing\r\ncriticism on the work of Richard Wagner. This divine music was not for\r\nthe intellectual few at all--it was getting popular and it was getting\r\nbad. Wagner was insincere--commercial--a charlatan.\r\n\r\nNietzsche was no longer interested in Wagner--he was interested only in\r\nNietzsche.\r\n\r\nLiterary men do not quarrel more than other men--it only seems as if\r\nthey did. This is because your writer uses his kazoo in getting even\r\nwith his supposed enemy--he flings the rhetorical stinkpot with\r\nprecision, and his grievances come into a prominence all out of keeping\r\nwith their importance.\r\n\r\nIn Eighteen Hundred Eighty-eight, Nietzsche issued his little book, \"The\r\nFall of Wagner.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a person has greatly praised another, and wishes to say something\r\nparticularly unkind about him, one horn of the dilemma must be taken. If\r\nyou admit you were wrong in the first conclusion, you lay yourself open\r\nto the suspicion that you are also wrong in the second--that you are one\r\nwho makes snap judgments. The safer way then is to cling close to the\r\npresumption of your own infallibility, without, of course, actually\r\nstating it, and claim that your idol has changed, backslidden--fallen.\r\nThis then lends an aura of virtue to your action, as it shows a\r\nwholesome desire on your part not to associate with the base person,\r\nand also an altruistic wish to warn the world so it shall not be undone\r\nby him.\r\n\r\nOf all the bitter, unkind and malicious things ever uttered against\r\nWagner, none contains more free alkali than the booklet by Nietzsche.\r\n\r\nNietzsche, not being satisfied with an attack on Wagner's art, also made\r\na few flings at his pedigree, and declared that the Master's real name\r\nwas not Wagner: this was his mother's name, he being a natural son of\r\nLudwig Geyer, the poet--the Jew. What this has to do with Tannhauser,\r\nTristan and Isolde, the Ring, Lohengrin, and Parsifal, Nietzsche does\r\nnot explain. In any event, the information about Wagner's birth comes\r\nwith very bad grace from an avowed enemy, who practically admits that he\r\ngot the facts, in confidence, from Wagner himself. Neither does\r\nNietzsche, the freethinking radical, recognize that good men have long\r\nceased taunting other men concerning their parentage, or boasting of\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\nA man is what he is; and the word \"illegitimate\" is not in God's\r\nvocabulary, since He smiles on love-children as on none other. If you\r\nknow history, you know this: that into their keeping God has largely\r\ngiven the beauty, talent, energy, strength, skill and power, as well as\r\nthat divinity which confuses its possessor with Deity Incarnate.\r\n\r\nWagner might have replied to Nietzsche in kind, and pointed him out as\r\nthe product of \"tired sheets,\" to use the phrase of Shakespeare. Wagner\r\nmight have said, \"Yes, I am a member of that elect class to which belong\r\nWilliam the Conqueror, Leonardo da Vinci, Erasmus, the Empress\r\nJosephine, Alexander Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln!\" But he didn't--he\r\ndid better--he said nothing. Wagner had the pride that scorned a\r\ndefense--he realized his priceless birthright, and knew that his mother\r\nand father had dowered him with a divine genius. Let those talk who\r\ncould do nothing else: silence was his only answer.\r\n\r\nIn a year later, Nietzsche was taken to an asylum, dead at the top. He\r\nlingered on until Nineteen Hundred, when his body, too, died, died there\r\nat Weimar, the home of Goethe and the home of Franz Liszt--another of\r\nlife's little ironies. It is an obvious thing to say that Friedrich\r\nNietzsche was insane all the time. The fact is, he was not. He was a\r\ngreat, sincere and honest soul, intent on living the ideal life. He\r\nwrote thoughts that have passed into the current coin of all the\r\nthinking world. When he praised Wagner to the skies and afterwards\r\ndamned him to the lowest depths of perdition, he was sane, and did the\r\nthing that has been done since Cain slew his brother Abel. Take it home\r\nto yourself--haven't the best things and the worst that have ever been\r\nsaid about you, been expressed by the same person?\r\n\r\nThe opinion of any one person concerning any man of genius, or any\r\nproduct of art, is absolutely valueless. Whim, prejudice, personal bias,\r\nand physical condition color our view and tint our opinions, and when we\r\ncease to love a man personally, to condemn his art is an easy and\r\nnatural step. What was before pleasing is now preposterous.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is all a point of view--a matter of perspective, and most\r\nof us are a trifle out of focus. When we change our opinions we change\r\nour friends.\r\n\r\nAs a prescription for preserving a just and proper view, and living a\r\nsane life, I would say, climb a tree occasionally, and hoot like an owl\r\nand caw like a crow; stand on your head and yell at times like a\r\nComanche.\r\n\r\nRobert Louis Stevenson says, \"A man who has not had the courage to make\r\na fool of himself has not lived.\"\r\n\r\nThe man who does not relax and hoot a few hoots voluntarily, now and\r\nthen, is in great danger of hooting hoots and standing on his head for\r\nthe edification of the pathologist and trained nurse, a little later on.\r\n\r\nThe madhouse yawns for the person who always does the proper thing.\r\nImpropriety, in right proportion, relieves congestion, and thus are the\r\nunities preserved. And so here the great Law of Compensation, invented\r\nby Ralph Waldo Emerson, comes in: The sane, healthy man, who\r\noccasionally strips off his dignity and hoots like an owl, or rolls\r\nnaked in the snow, will surely be called insane by the self-nominated\r\nelect, but his personal compensation lies in the fact that he knows he\r\nis not.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now look upon the face of this man! Even so, and upon every face is\r\nwritten the record of the life the man has led: the loves that were his,\r\nthe thoughts, the prayers, the aspirations, the disappointments, all he\r\nhoped to be and was not--all are written there--nothing is hidden, nor\r\ncan it be. Here was one born in poverty, nurtured in adversity, and yet\r\nuplifted and sustained by homely friendships and rugged companions who\r\ndumbly guessed the latent greatness of their charge.\r\n\r\nWith soul athirst he sought for truth, and stubbornly groped his way\r\nalone. Immediate precedent stood to him for little, and his sincerity\r\nand honesty made him the butt of mob and rabble. His ambition to be\r\nhimself, to live his life, the desire to express his honest thought, led\r\nstraight to deprivation of bread and shelter. He had too much sympathy,\r\nhis honesty was not tempered by the graces of a diplomat--a price was\r\nplaced upon his head. By the help of that one noble friend, whose love\r\nupheld him to the last, he escaped to a country where freedom of speech\r\nis not a byword. But misunderstanding followed close upon his footsteps,\r\neven his wife doubted his sanity, mistaking his genius for folly, and\r\ndied undeceived. Calumny, hate, brutal criticism, the contempt of the\r\nso-called learned class--and all the train of woe that want and debt can\r\nbring to bear were his lot and portion.\r\n\r\nStill he struggled on, refusing to compromise or parley--he would live\r\nhis life, expressing the divinity within, and if fate decreed it so, die\r\nthe death, misunderstood, reviled, and be forgotten.\r\n\r\nAnd so he lived, working, praying, hoping, toiling, travailing--but with\r\ndays, now and then, when rifts broke the clouds and the sun shone\r\nthrough, his Other Self giving approbation by saying, \"Well done! the\r\nwork will live.\"\r\n\r\nMore than half a century had passed over his head, and the frost of\r\nyears had whitened his locks; his form was bowed from the many burdens\r\nit had borne; the fine face furrowed with lines of care; his eyes grown\r\ndim from weeping--when gradually the critics grew less severe.\r\n\r\nAdvocates were coming to the front, demanding that brutal hands should\r\nno longer mangle this man: grudgingly pardon came for offenses never\r\ncommitted, and he was permitted to return to his native land. Strong men\r\nand women placed themselves on his side. They declared their faith, and\r\nsaid his work was sublime; and they boldly stated the patent fact that\r\nthose who had done most to cry Wagner down, had themselves done nothing,\r\nnor added an iota to the wealth or the harmony of the world. People\r\nbegan to listen, to investigate, and they said, \"Why, yes, the music of\r\nWagner has a distinct style--it has individuality.\"\r\n\r\nIndividuality is a departure from a complete type, and so is never\r\nperfect, any more than man is perfect. But Wagner's music is honest and\r\ngenuine emotion set to sweet sounds, with words in keeping. It mirrors\r\nthe hopes, the disappointments, the aspirations and the love of a great\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nAs men and women grew to cultivate the hospitable mind and receptive\r\nheart, tears filled their eyes and as they listened they came to\r\nunderstand. Honesty and genuineness in souls are too rare to flout--when\r\nfound men really uncover before them. The people saw at last that they\r\nhad been deceived by the savants, blinded by the dust of paid and\r\nprejudiced critics, fooled by those who led the way for a consideration.\r\nThey flocked to see the great composer and listen to his matchless\r\nmusic, and they gave the man and his work their approval. Such sums were\r\npaid to him as he had only read of in books. Adulation, approbation and\r\ncrowning fame were his at last.\r\n\r\nThen love came that way and gentle, trusting affection, and sweet,\r\nspiritual comradeship, such as he had never known except in dreams--all\r\nthese were his. His fame increased, and lavish offers from across the\r\nsea came, proffering him such wealth and honor as were not for any other\r\nliving artist.\r\n\r\nA theater was built for the presentation of his productions alone; the\r\nlovers of music from every nation made Bayreuth a place of pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nWhen the man died--passed peacefully away, supported by the arms of the\r\none woman he had loved--the daughter of Liszt--the art-loving world\r\npaid his genius all the tribute that men can offer to the worth of other\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAnd now the passing years have brought a confirmation in belief of the\r\nstatement made by Franz Liszt, \"Richard Wagner is the one true musical\r\ngenius of his age.\"\r\n\r\nWagner's admirers should, for him, plead guilty to the worst that can be\r\nsaid: he is everything that his most bitter critics say, but he is so\r\nmuch more that his faults and follies sink into ashes before the divine\r\nfire of his genius, and we still have the gold. Inconsistent,\r\nparadoxical, preposterous--why, yes, of course! Still he is the greatest\r\npoet of passion the world has ever seen--don't cavil--passion's\r\nconsistency consists in being inconsistent.\r\n\r\n\"Every sentence must have a man behind it,\" and so we might say, \"Every\r\nbar of music must have a man behind it.\" That harmony only can live\r\nwhich once had its dwelling-place in a great and tender heart.\r\n\r\nThe province of art is to impart a sublime emotion, and that which\r\naffects to be an emotion, no matter how subtly launched, can never live\r\nas classic art. Honesty here, as elsewhere, must have its reward. Be\r\nyourself, though all the world laugh.\r\n\r\nI will not say that Wagner was--he is. The man himself in life was often\r\nworn to the quick by the deprivations he had to endure, or the stupid\r\nmisunderstandings he encountered, so at times he was impatient,\r\nerratic, possibly perverse. But all that is gone--his mistakes have\r\nbeen washed in the blood of Time--only the good survives. The best that\r\nthis great and godlike man ever thought, or felt, or knew, is ours--he\r\nlives immortal in his Art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAGANINI]\r\n\r\nPAGANINI\r\n\r\n\r\n         For lo! creation's self is one great choir,\r\n     And what is Nature's order but the rhyme\r\n     Whereto the worlds keep time,\r\n     And all things move with all things from their prime?\r\n     Who shall expound the mystery of the lyre?\r\n     In far retreats of elemental mind\r\n     Obscurely comes and goes\r\n     The imperative breath of song, that as the wind\r\n     Is trackless, and oblivious whence it blows.\r\n\r\n     --_William Watson_\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGANINI\r\n\r\nSome time ago, after my lecture one night in Boston, I bethought me to\r\ncall on my old friend Bliss Carman. I expected he would be sleeping the\r\nsleep of the just, but I was prepared to rout him out, for although my\r\nerrand was from a fair, frail young thing, and trivial, yet I was bound\r\nto deliver the message--for that is what one should always do.\r\n\r\nBut the poet was not abed--he was pacing the room in a fine burst of\r\npoetic fervor, composing \"More Songs From Vagabondia.\" The songs told of\r\npurling streams, hedgerows, bathers lolling on the river-bank, nodding\r\nwild flowers, chirping pewees, and other such poetic properties, which\r\nthe singer conjured forth from boyhood's days, long since gone by.\r\n\r\nThis suite of rooms, where the poet worked, was in a fine house on a\r\nfashionable street, and I noticed the place bore every mark of elegant\r\nbachelor ease and convenience that good taste could dictate. The best\r\n\"Songs From Vagabondia,\" I am told, are written in comfortable\r\napartments, where there are a bath and a Whitely Exerciser; but patient,\r\npersistent effort and work overtime are necessary to lick the lines into\r\nshape so they will live. Good poets run their machinery in double\r\nshifts.\r\n\r\n\"Go away!\" cried Bliss Carman, when he had opened the door in reply to\r\nmy sprightly knock. \"Go away! I am giving to airy nothings a local\r\nhabitation and a name. This is my busy night--do you not see?\" And fully\r\nunderstanding the conditions, for I am a poet myself, I went away and\r\nleft the author to his labors.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to assume that genius is the capacity for evading hard\r\nwork. \"La Vie de Boheme\" is a beautiful myth that was first worked out\r\nwith consummate labor by a man of imagination named Murger, and told\r\nagain with variations by Balzac and Du Maurier. Boheme is not down on\r\nthe map, because it is not a money-order post-office. It is only a Queen\r\nMab fairy fabric of a warm, transient desire; its walls being\r\nconstructed of the stuff that dreams are made of, and its little life is\r\nrounded with a pipe and tabor, two empties and a brass tray. Yet the\r\nsemblance of the thing is there and this often deceives the very elect.\r\nAround every art studio are found the young men in velveteen who smoke\r\ninfinite cigarettes, and throw off opinions about this great man and\r\nthat, and prate prosaically in blase monotone of the Beautiful.\r\nSometimes these young persons give lectures on \"Art as I Have Found It\";\r\nbut do not be deceived by this--the art that lives is probably being\r\nproduced by small, shy, red-headed men who work on a top floor, and whom\r\nyou can only find with the help of a search-warrant. One sort talks of\r\nart, the other kind produces it. One tells of truth, the other is\r\nliving it.\r\n\r\nEdgar Allan Poe wrote the most gruesome stories that have ever been\r\ntold, just to prove that life is a tragedy and not worth living. But who\r\never lived fuller and applied himself to hard work more conscientiously\r\nin order to make his point? Poe wrote and rewrote, and changed and added\r\nand interlined and balanced it all on his actor's tongue, and read it\r\naloud before the glass. Poe shortened his days and flung away a valuable\r\nfag-end of his life, trying to show that life is not worth living, and\r\nthus proved it is. Gray spent thirteen years writing his \"Elegy,\" and so\r\nmade clear the point that the man who does good work does not at the\r\nlast lay him down and rest his head upon the lap of earth, a youth to\r\nfortune and to fame unknown. Gray secured both fame and fortune. He was\r\nso successful that he declined the Laureateship, and had the felicity to\r\ndie of gout. Gray's immortality is based upon the fact that his life\r\ngave the lie to his logic. The man who thinks out what he wants to do,\r\nand then works and works hard, will win, and no others do, or ever have,\r\nor can--God will not have it so.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a violinist Paganini far surpassed all other players who ever lived;\r\nand when one follows the story of his life, the fact is apparent that he\r\nsucceeded because he worked.\r\n\r\nAnd yet behold the paradox! The idea existed in his own day, and is\r\nabroad yet, that \"the devil guided his hand,\" for the thought that the\r\ndevil is more powerful than God has ever been held by the majority of\r\nmen--more especially if a fiddle is concerned.\r\n\r\nSuch patience, such persistency, such painstaking effort as the man put\r\nforth for a score of years would have made him master at anything. The\r\npublic knows nothing of these long years of labor and preparation--it\r\nsees only the result, and this result shows such consummate ease and\r\nnaturalness--all done without effort--that it exclaims, \"A genius--the\r\ndevil guides his hand!\" The remark was made of Titian and his wonderful\r\ncolor effects, and then again of Rembrandt with his mysterious limpid\r\nshadows--their competitors could not understand it! And so they disposed\r\nof the subject by attributing it to a supernatural agency.\r\n\r\nThings all men can do and explain are natural; things we can not explain\r\nare \"supernatural.\" Progress consists in taking things out of the\r\nsupernatural pigeonhole and placing them in the natural. As soon as we\r\ncomprehend the supernatural, we are a bit surprised to find it is\r\nperfectly natural.\r\n\r\nBut the limitations of great men are seen in that when they have\r\nacquired the skill to do a difficult thing well, and the public cries,\r\n\"Genius!\" why the genius humors the superstition and begins to allow the\r\nimpression to get out mysteriously that he \"never had a lesson in his\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nAny man who caters to the public is to a great degree spoiled by the\r\npublic. Actors act off the stage as well as on, falling victims to their\r\ntrade: their lives are stained by pretense and affectation, just as the\r\ndyer's hand is subdued to the medium in which it works. The man of\r\ntalent who is much before the public poses because his audience wishes\r\nhim to; one step more and the pose becomes natural--he can not divest\r\nhimself of it. Paganini by hard work became a consummate player; and\r\nthen so the dear public should receive its money's worth, he evolved\r\ninto a consummate poseur--but he was still the Artist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA large number of writers have described the appearance and playing of\r\nNiccolo Paganini, but none ever did the assignment with the creepy\r\nvividness of Heinrich Heine. The rest of this chapter is Heine's. I make\r\nthe explanation because the passage is so well known that it would be\r\nboth indiscreet and inexpedient for me to bring my literary jimmy to\r\nbear and claim it as my own--much as I would like to.\r\n\r\nSays Heinrich Heine:\r\n\r\n     I believe that only one man has succeeded in putting Paganini's\r\n     true physiognomy upon paper--a deaf painter, Lyser by name, who, in\r\n     a frenzy full of genius, has with a few strokes of chalk so well\r\n     hit the great violinist's head that one is at the same time amused\r\n     and terrified at the truth of the drawing. \"The devil guided my\r\n     hand,\" the deaf painter said to me, chuckling mysteriously, and\r\n     nodding his head with a good-natured irony in the way he generally\r\n     accompanied his genial witticisms. This painter was, however, a\r\n     wonderful old fellow; in spite of his deafness he was\r\n     enthusiastically fond of music, and he knew how, when near enough\r\n     to the orchestra, to read the music in the musicians' faces, and to\r\n     judge the more or less skilful execution by the movements of their\r\n     fingers; indeed, he wrote critiques on the opera for an excellent\r\n     journal at Hamburg. And yet is that peculiarly wonderful? In the\r\n     visible symbols of the performance the deaf painter could see the\r\n     sounds. There are men to whom the sounds themselves are invisible\r\n     symbols in which they hear colors and forms.\r\n\r\n     I am sorry that I no longer possess Lyser's little drawing; it\r\n     would perhaps have given you an idea of Paganini's outward\r\n     appearance. Only with black and glaring strokes could those\r\n     mysterious features be seized, features which seemed to belong more\r\n     to the sulphurous kingdom of shades than to the sunny world of\r\n     life. \"Indeed, the devil guided my hand,\" the deaf painter assured\r\n     me, as we stood before the pavilion at Hamburg on the day when\r\n     Paganini gave his first concert there. \"Yes, my friend, it is true\r\n     that he has sold himself to the devil, body and soul, in order to\r\n     become the best violinist, to fiddle millions of money, and\r\n     principally to escape the damnable galley where he had already\r\n     languished many years. For, you see, my friend, when he was\r\n     chapel-master at Lucca he fell in love with a princess of the\r\n     theater, was jealous of some little abbate, was perhaps deceived by\r\n     the faithless amata, stabbed her in approved Italian fashion, came\r\n     in the galley to Genoa, and as I said, sold himself to the devil to\r\n     escape from it, became the best violin-player, and imposed upon us\r\n     this evening a contribution of two thalers each. But, you see, all\r\n     good spirits praise God! There in the avenue he comes himself, with\r\n     his suspicious impresario.\"\r\n\r\n     It was Paganini himself whom I then saw for the first time. He wore\r\n     a dark gray overcoat, which reached to his heels, and made his\r\n     figure seem very tall. His long black hair fell in neglected curls\r\n     on his shoulders, and formed a dark frame round the pale,\r\n     cadaverous face, on which sorrow, genius and hell had engraved\r\n     their lines. Near him danced along a little pleasing figure,\r\n     elegantly prosaic--with rosy, wrinkled face, bright gray little\r\n     coat with steel buttons, distributing greetings on all sides in an\r\n     insupportably friendly way, leering up, nevertheless, with\r\n     apprehensive air at the gloomy figure who walked earnest and\r\n     thoughtful at his side. It reminded one of Retzsch's presentation\r\n     of \"Faust\" and Wagner walking before the gates of Leipzig. The deaf\r\n     painter made comments to me in his mad way, and bade me observe\r\n     especially the broad, measured walk of Paganini. \"Does it not\r\n     seem,\" said he, \"as if he had the iron cross-pole still between his\r\n     legs? He has accustomed himself to that walk forever. See, too, in\r\n     what a contemptuous, ironical way he sometimes looks at his guide\r\n     when the latter wearies him with his prosaic questions. But he can\r\n     not separate himself from him; a bloody contract binds him to that\r\n     companion, who is no other than Satan. The ignorant multitude,\r\n     indeed, believe that this guide is the writer of comedies and\r\n     anecdotes, Harris from Hanover, whom Paganini has taken with him to\r\n     manage the financial business of his concerts. But they do not know\r\n     that the devil has only borrowed Herr George Harris' form, and that\r\n     meanwhile the poor soul of this poor man is shut up with other\r\n     rubbish in a trunk at Hanover, until the devil returns its\r\n     flesh-envelope, while he perhaps will guide his master through the\r\n     world in a worthier form--namely as a black poodle.\"\r\n\r\n     But if Paganini seemed mysterious and strange enough when I saw him\r\n     walking in bright midday under the green trees of the Hamburg\r\n     Jungfernstieg, how his awful bizarre appearance startled me at the\r\n     concert in the evening! The Hamburg Opera House was the scene of\r\n     this concert, and the art-loving public had flocked there so\r\n     early, and in such numbers, that I only just succeeded in obtaining\r\n     a little place in the orchestra. Although it was post-day, I saw in\r\n     the first row of boxes the whole educated commercial world, a whole\r\n     Olympus of bankers and other millionaires, the gods of coffee and\r\n     sugar by the side of their fat goddesses, Junos of Wandrahm and\r\n     Aphrodites of Dreckwall. A religious silence reigned through the\r\n     assembly. Every eye was directed towards the stage. Every ear was\r\n     making ready to listen. My neighbor, an old furrier, took the dirty\r\n     cotton out of his ears in order to drink in better the costly\r\n     sounds for which he had paid his two thalers.\r\n\r\n     At last a dark figure, which seemed to have arisen from the\r\n     underworld, appeared upon the stage. It was Paganini in his black\r\n     costume--the black dress-coat and the black waistcoat of a horrible\r\n     cut, such as is prescribed by infernal etiquette at the court of\r\n     Proserpine. The black trousers hung anxiously around the thin legs.\r\n     The long arms appeared to grow still longer, as, holding the violin\r\n     in one hand and the bow in the other, he almost touched the floor\r\n     with them, while displaying to the public his unprecedented\r\n     obeisances. In the angular curves of his body there was a horrible\r\n     woodenness, and also something absurdly animal-like, that during\r\n     these bows one could not help feeling a strange desire to laugh.\r\n     But his face, that appeared still more cadaverously pale in the\r\n     glare of the orchestra lights, had about it something so imploring,\r\n     so simply humble, that a sorrowful compassion repressed one's\r\n     desire to smile. Had he learnt these complimentary bows from an\r\n     automaton, or a dog? Is that the entreating gaze of one sick unto\r\n     death, or is there lurking behind it the mockery of a crafty\r\n     miser? Is that a man brought into the arena at the moment of death,\r\n     like a dying gladiator, to delight the public with his convulsions?\r\n     Or is it one risen from the dead, a vampire with a violin, who, if\r\n     not the blood out of our hearts, at any rate sucks the gold out of\r\n     our pockets?\r\n\r\n     Such questions crossed our minds while Paganini was performing his\r\n     strange bows, but all those thoughts were at once still when the\r\n     wonderful master placed his violin under his chin and began to\r\n     play.\r\n\r\n     As for me, you already know my musical second-sight, my gift of\r\n     seeing at each tone a figure equivalent to the sound, and so\r\n     Paganini with each stroke of his bow brought visible forms and\r\n     situations before my eyes; he told me in melodious hieroglyphics\r\n     all kinds of brilliant tales; he, as it were, made a magic lantern\r\n     play its colored antics before me, he himself being chief actor. At\r\n     the first stroke of his bow the stage scenery around him had\r\n     changed; he suddenly stood with his music-desk in a cheerful room,\r\n     decorated in a gay, irregular way after the Pompadour style;\r\n     everywhere little mirrors, gilded Cupids, Chinese porcelain, a\r\n     delightful chaos of ribbons, garlands of flowers, white gloves,\r\n     torn lace, false pearls, powder-puffs, diamonds of gold-leaf and\r\n     spangles--such tinsel as one finds in the room of a prima donna.\r\n     Paganini's outward appearance had also changed, and certainly most\r\n     advantageously; he wore short breeches of lily-colored satin, a\r\n     white waistcoat embroidered with silver, and a coat of bright blue\r\n     velvet with gold buttons; the hair in little carefully curled locks\r\n     bordered his face, which was young and rosy, and gleamed with sweet\r\n     tenderness as he ogled the pretty young lady who stood near him at\r\n     the music-desk, while he played the violin.\r\n\r\n     Yes, I saw at his side a pretty young creature, dressed in antique\r\n     costume, the white satin swelled out above the waist, making the\r\n     figure still more charmingly slender; the high raised hair was\r\n     powdered and curled, and the pretty round face shone out all the\r\n     more openly with its glancing eyes, its little rouged cheeks, its\r\n     tiny beauty-patches, and the sweet, impertinent little nose. In her\r\n     hand was a roll of white paper, and by the movements of her lips as\r\n     well as by the coquettish waving to and fro of her little upper lip\r\n     she seemed to be singing; but none of her trills was audible to me,\r\n     and only from the violin with which young Paganini led the lovely\r\n     child could I discover what she sang, and what he himself during\r\n     her song felt in his soul.\r\n\r\n     Oh, what melodies were those! Like the nightingale's notes, when\r\n     the fragrance of the rose intoxicates her yearning young heart with\r\n     desire, they floated in the twilight. Oh, what melting, languid\r\n     delight was that! The sounds kissed each other, then fled away\r\n     pouting, and then, laughing, clasped each other and became one, and\r\n     died away in intoxicating harmony. Yes, the sounds carried on their\r\n     merry game like butterflies, when one, in playful provocation, will\r\n     escape from another, hide behind a flower, be overtaken at last,\r\n     and then, wantonly joying with the other, fly away into the golden\r\n     sunlight. But a spider, a spider can prepare a sudden tragical fate\r\n     for such enamored butterflies!\r\n\r\n     Did the young heart anticipate this? A melancholy sighing tone, a\r\n     sad foreboding of some slowly approaching misfortune, glided softly\r\n     through the enrapturing melodies that were streaming from\r\n     Paganini's violin. His eyes became moist. Adoringly he knelt down\r\n     before his amata. But, alas! as he bowed down to kiss her feet, he\r\n     saw under the sofa a little abbate! I do not know what he had\r\n     against the poor man, but the Genoese became pale as death. He\r\n     seized the little fellow with furious hands, drew a stiletto from\r\n     its sheath, and buried it in the young rogue's breast.\r\n\r\n     At this moment, however, a shout of \"Bravo! Bravo!\" broke out from\r\n     all sides. Hamburg's enthusiastic sons and daughters were paying\r\n     the tribute of their uproarious applause to the great artist, who\r\n     had just ended the first of his concert, and was now bowing with\r\n     even more angles and contortions than before. And on his face the\r\n     abject humility seems to me to have become more intense. From his\r\n     eyes stared a sorrowful anxiety like that of a poor malefactor.\r\n     \"Divine!\" cried my neighbor, the furrier, as he scratched his ears;\r\n     \"that piece alone was worth two thalers.\"\r\n\r\n     When Paganini began to play again a gloom came before my eyes. The\r\n     sounds were not transformed into bright forms and colors; the\r\n     master's form was clothed in gloomy shades, out of the darkness of\r\n     which his music moaned in the most piercing tones of lamentation.\r\n\r\n     Only at times, when a little lamp that hung above cast its\r\n     sorrowful light over him, could I catch a glimpse of his pale\r\n     countenance, on which the youth was not yet extinguished. His\r\n     costume was singular, in two colors, yellow and red. Heavy chains\r\n     weighed upon his feet. Behind him moved a face whose physiognomy\r\n     indicated a lusty goat-nature. And I saw at times long, hairy hands\r\n     seize assistingly the strings of the violin on which Paganini was\r\n     playing. They often guided the hand which held the bow, and then a\r\n     bleat-laugh of applause accompanied the melody, which gushed from\r\n     the violin ever more full of sorrow and anguish. They were melodies\r\n     which were like the song of the fallen angels who had loved the\r\n     daughters of earth, and being exiled from the kingdom of the\r\n     blessed, sank into the underworld with faces red with shame. They\r\n     were melodies in whose bottomless depths glimmered neither\r\n     consolation nor hope. When the saints in heaven hear such melodies,\r\n     the praise of God dies upon their paled lips, and they cover their\r\n     heads weeping. At times when the obligate goat's laugh bleated in\r\n     among the melodious pangs, I caught a glimpse in the background of\r\n     a crowd of small women-figures who nodded their odious heads with\r\n     wicked wantonness. Then a rush of agonizing sounds came from the\r\n     violin, and a fearful groan and a sob, such as was never heard upon\r\n     earth before, nor will be perhaps heard upon earth again, unless in\r\n     the valley of Jehoshaphat, when the colossal trumpets of doom shall\r\n     ring out, and the naked corpses shall crawl forth from the grave to\r\n     abide their fate. But the agonized violinist suddenly made one\r\n     stroke of the bow, such a mad, despairing stroke, that his chains\r\n     fell rattling from him, and his mysterious assistant and the other\r\n     foul, mocking forms vanished.\r\n\r\n     At this moment my neighbor, the furrier, said, \"A pity, a pity! a\r\n     string has snapped--that comes from constant pizzicato.\"\r\n\r\n     Had a string of the violin really snapped? I do not know. I only\r\n     observed the alternation in the sounds, and Paganini and his\r\n     surroundings seemed to me again suddenly changed. I could scarcely\r\n     recognize him in the monk's brown dress, which concealed rather\r\n     than clothed him. With savage countenance half-hid by the cowl,\r\n     waist girt with a cord, and bare feet, Paganini stood, a solitary\r\n     defiant figure, on a rocky prominence by the sea, and played his\r\n     violin. But the sea became red and redder, and the sky grew paler,\r\n     till at last the surging water looked like bright, scarlet blood,\r\n     and the sky above became of a ghastly corpse-like pallor, and the\r\n     stars came out large and threatening; and those stars were\r\n     black--black as glooming coal. But the tones of the violin grew\r\n     ever more stormy and defiant, and the eyes of the terrible player\r\n     sparkled with such a scornful lust of destruction, and his thin\r\n     lips moved with such a horrible haste, that it seemed as if he\r\n     murmured some old accursed charms to conjure the storm and loose\r\n     the evil spirits that lie imprisoned in the abysses of the sea.\r\n     Often, when he stretched his long, thin arm from the broad monk's\r\n     sleeve, and swept the air with his bow, he seemed like some\r\n     sorcerer who commands the elements with his magic wand; and then\r\n     there was a wild wailing from the depth of the sea, and the\r\n     horrible waves of blood sprang up so fiercely that they almost\r\n     besprinkled the pale sky and the black stars with their red foam.\r\n     There was a wailing and a shrieking and a crashing, as if the world\r\n     was falling into fragments, and ever more stubbornly the monk\r\n     played his violin. He seemed as if by the power of violent will he\r\n     wished to break the seven seals wherewith Solomon sealed the iron\r\n     vessels in which he had shut up the vanquished demons. The wise\r\n     king sank those vessels in the sea and I seemed to hear the voices\r\n     of the imprisoned spirits while Paganini's violin growled its most\r\n     wrathful bass.\r\n\r\n     But at last I thought I heard the jubilee of deliverance, and out\r\n     of the red billows of blood emerged the heads of the fettered\r\n     demons: monsters of legendary horror, crocodiles with bats' wings,\r\n     snakes with stags' horns, monkeys with shells on their heads, seals\r\n     with long patriarchal beards, women's faces with one eye, green\r\n     camels' heads, all staring with cold, crafty eyes, and long,\r\n     fin-like claws grasping at the fiddling monk. From the latter,\r\n     however, in the furious zeal of his conjuration, the cowl fell back\r\n     and the curly hair, fluttering in the wind, fell round his head in\r\n     ringlets, like black snakes.\r\n\r\n     So maddening was this vision that to keep my senses I closed my\r\n     ears and shut my eyes. When I again looked up the specter had\r\n     vanished, and I saw the poor Genoese in his ordinary form, making\r\n     his ordinary bows, while the public applauded in the most rapturous\r\n     manner.\r\n\r\n     \"That is the famous performance upon G,\" remarked my neighbor. \"I\r\n     myself play the violin, and I know what it is to master the\r\n     instrument.\" Fortunately, the pause was not considerable, or else\r\n     the musical furrier would certainly have engaged me in a long\r\n     conversation upon art. Paganini again quietly set his violin to his\r\n     chin, and with the first stroke of his bow the wonderful\r\n     transformation of melodies again began.\r\n\r\n     They no longer fashioned themselves so brightly and corporeally.\r\n     The melody gently developed itself, majestically billowing and\r\n     swelling like an organ chorale in a cathedral, and everything\r\n     around, stretching larger and higher, had extended into a colossal\r\n     space which, not the bodily eye, but only the eye of the spirit\r\n     could seize. In the midst of this space hovered a shining sphere,\r\n     upon which, gigantic and sublimely haughty, stood a man who played\r\n     the violin. Was that sphere the sun? I do not know. But in the\r\n     man's features I recognized Paganini, only ideally lovely, divinely\r\n     glorious, with a reconciling smile. His body was in the bloom of\r\n     powerful manhood, a bright blue garment enclosed his noble limbs,\r\n     his shoulders were covered by gleaming locks of black hair; and as\r\n     he stood there, sure and secure, a sublime divinity, and played the\r\n     violin, it seemed as if the whole creation obeyed his melodies. He\r\n     was the man-planet about which the universe moved with measured\r\n     solemnity and ringing out beatific rhythms. Those great lights,\r\n     which so quietly gleaming swept around, were they stars of heaven,\r\n     and that melodious harmony which arose from their movements, was it\r\n     the song of the spheres, of which poets and seers have reported so\r\n     many ravishing things? At times, when I endeavored to gaze out into\r\n     the misty distance, I thought I saw pure white garments floating\r\n     ground, in which colossal pilgrims passed muffled along with white\r\n     staves in their hands, and singular to relate, the golden knob of\r\n     each staff was even one of those great lights which I had taken for\r\n     stars. These pilgrims moved in a large orbit around the great\r\n     performer, the golden knobs of their staves shone even brighter at\r\n     the tones of the violin, and the chorale which resounded from their\r\n     lips, and which I had taken for the song of the spheres, was only\r\n     the dying echo of those violin tones. A holy, ineffable ardor dwelt\r\n     in those sounds, which often trembled scarce audibly, in mysterious\r\n     whisper on the water, then swelled out again with a shuddering\r\n     sweetness, like a bugle's notes heard by moonlight, and then\r\n     finally poured forth in unrestrained jubilee, as if a thousand\r\n     bards had struck their harps and raised their voices in a song of\r\n     victory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Seventeen Hundred Eighty-four, Niccolo Paganini was born at Genoa.\r\nHis father was a street-porter who eked out the scanty exchequer by\r\nplaying a violin at occasional dances or concerts. That his playing was\r\nindifferent is evident from the fact that he was very poor--his services\r\nwere not in demand.\r\n\r\nThe poverty of the family and the failure of the father fired the\r\nambition of the boy to do something worthy. When he was ten years old he\r\ncould play as well as his father, and a year or so thereafter could play\r\nbetter. The lad was tall, slender, delicate and dreamy-eyed. But he had\r\nwill plus, and his desire was to sound the possibilities of the violin.\r\nAnd this reminds me that Hugh Pentecost says there is no such thing as\r\nwill--it is all desire: when we desire a thing strongly enough, we have\r\nthe will to secure it--but no matter!\r\n\r\nYoung Niccolo Paganini practised on his father's violin for six hours a\r\nday; and now when the customers who used to hire his father to play\r\ncame, they would say, \"We just as lief have Niccolo.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after this they said, \"We prefer to have Niccolo.\" And a little\r\nlater they said, \"We must have Niccolo.\" Some one has written a book to\r\nshow that playing second fiddle is just as worthy an office as playing\r\nfirst. This doubtless is true, but there are so many more men who can\r\nplay second, that it behooves every player to relieve the stress by\r\nplaying first if he can. Niccolo played first and then was called upon\r\nto play solos. He was making twice as much money as his father ever had,\r\nbut the father took all the boy's earnings, as was his legal right. The\r\nfather's pride in the success of the son, the young man always said, was\r\nbecause he was proving a good financial investment. It does not always\r\npay to raise children--this time it did. It was finally decided to take\r\nthe boy to the celebrated musician, Rolla, for advice as to what was\r\nbest to do about his education. Rolla was sick abed at the time the boy\r\ncalled and could not see him; but while waiting in the entry the lad\r\ntook up a violin and began to play. The invalid raised himself on one\r\nelbow and pantingly inquired who the great master was that had thus\r\nfavored him with a visit.\r\n\r\n\"It's the lad who wants you to give him lessons,\" answered the\r\nattendant.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible! no lad could play like that--I can teach that player\r\nnothing!\"\r\n\r\nNext the musician Paer was visited, and he passed the boy along to\r\nGiretta, who gave him three lessons a week in harmony and counterpoint.\r\nThe boy had abrupt mannerisms and tricks of his own in bringing out\r\nexpressions, and these were such a puzzle to the teacher that he soon\r\nrefused to go on.\r\n\r\nNiccolo possessed a sort of haughty self-confidence that aggravated the\r\nmaster; he believed in himself and was fond of showing that he could\r\nplay in a way no one else could. Adolescence had turned his desire to\r\nplay into a fury of passion for his art: he practised on single passages\r\nfor ten or twelve hours a day, and would often sink in a swoon from\r\nsheer exhaustion. This deep, torpor-like sleep saved him from complete\r\ncollapse, just as it saved Mendelssohn, and he would arise to go on with\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\nPaganini's wisdom was shown at this early age in that he limited his\r\nwork to a few compositions, and these he made the most of, just as they\r\nsay Bossuet secured his reputation as the greatest preacher of his time\r\nby a single sermon that he had polished to the point of perfection.\r\n\r\nWhen fifteen years old Paganini contrived to escape from his father and\r\nwent to a musical festival at Lucca. He managed to get a hearing, was\r\nengaged at once as a soloist, and soon after gave a concert on his own\r\naccount. In a month he had accumulated a thousand pounds in cash.\r\n\r\nVery naturally, such a success turned the head of this lad who never\r\nbefore had had the handling of money. He began to gamble, and became the\r\ndupe of rogues--male and female--who plunged him into an abyss of wrong.\r\nHe even gambled away the \"Stradivarius\" that had been presented to him,\r\nand when his money, watch and jewels were gone, his new-found friends of\r\ncourse decamped, and this gave the young man time to ponder on the\r\nvanities of life.\r\n\r\nWhen he played again it was on a borrowed \"Guarnerius,\" and after the\r\nrich owner, himself a violinist, had heard him play, he said, \"No\r\nfingers but yours shall ever play that violin again!\"\r\n\r\nPaganini accepted the gift, and this was the violin he played for full\r\nforty years, and which, on his death, was willed to his native city of\r\nGenoa. There it can be seen in its sealed-up glass case.\r\n\r\nUp to his thirtieth year Paganini continued his severe work of subduing\r\nthe violin. By that time he had sounded its possibilities, and\r\nthereafter no one heard him play except in concert. It is told that one\r\nman, anxious to know the secrets of Paganini's power, followed him from\r\ncity to city, watching him at his concerts, dogging him through the\r\nstreets, spying upon him at hotels. At one inn this man of curiosity had\r\nthe felicity to secure a room next to the one occupied by Paganini; and\r\none morning as he watched through the keyhole, he was rewarded by seeing\r\nthe master open the case where reposed the precious \"Guarnerius.\"\r\nPaganini lifted the instrument, held it under his chin, took up the bow\r\nand made a few passes in the air--not a sound was heard. Then he kissed\r\nthe back of the violin, muttered a prayer, and locked the instrument in\r\nits case.\r\n\r\nAt concert rehearsals he always played a mute instrument; and Harris,\r\nhis manager, records that for the many years he was with Paganini he\r\nnever heard him play a single note except before an audience.\r\n\r\nI have a full-length daguerreotype of Paganini taken when he was forty\r\nyears of age. No one ever asked this man, \"Kind sir, are you anybody in\r\nparticular?\"\r\n\r\nPaganini was tall and wofully slim. His hands and feet were large and\r\nbony, his arms long, his form bowed and lacking in all that we call\r\nsymmetry. But the long face with its look of abject melancholy, the\r\ncurved nose, the thin lips and the sharp, protruding chin, made a\r\ncombination that Fate has never duplicated. You could easily believe\r\nthat this man knew all the secrets of the Nether World, and had tasted\r\nthe joys of Paradise as well. Women pitied and loved him, men feared\r\nhim, and none understood him. He lived in the midst of throngs and\r\nmultitudes--the loneliest man known in the history of art.\r\n\r\nPaganini, when he had reached his height, played only his own music; he\r\nplayed divinely and incomprehensibly; next to his passion for music was\r\nhis greed for gold. These three facts sum up all we really know about\r\nthe master--the rest fades off into mist--mystery, fable and legend. We\r\ndo know, however, that he composed several pieces of music so difficult\r\nthat he could not play them himself, and of course no one else can.\r\nImagination can always outrun performance. Paganini had no close\r\nfriends; no confidants: he never mingled in society, and he never\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\nAt times he would disappear from the public gaze for several months,\r\nand not even his business associates knew where he was. On one such\r\noccasion a traveler discovered him in a monastic retreat in the Swiss\r\nMountains, wearing a horsehair robe and a rope girdle; others saw him\r\ndisguised as a mendicant; and still another tells of finding him working\r\nas a day-laborer with obscure and ignorant peasants. Then there are\r\ntales told of how he was taken captive by a titled lady of great wealth\r\nand beauty, who carried him away to her bower, where he eschewed the\r\nviolin and tinkled only the guitar the livelong day.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the report was current that Paganini had killed a man, and\r\nbeen sentenced to prison for life. The story ran that in prison he found\r\nan old violin, three strings of which were broken, and so he played on\r\none string, producing such ravishing music that the keepers feared he\r\nwas \"possessed.\" They decided they must get rid of him, and so contrived\r\nto have him thrown overboard from a galley; but he swam ashore, and\r\nalthough he was everywhere known, no man dared place a hand on him.\r\n\r\nA late writer in a London magazine, however, has given evidence of being\r\na psychologist and man of sense; he says, and produces proof, that after\r\nthe concert season was over Paganini withdrew to a monastery in the\r\nmountains of Switzerland, and there the monks who loved him well,\r\nguarded his retreat. There he found the rest for which his soul craved,\r\nand there he practised on his violin hour after hour, day after day.\r\nAll this is better understood when we remember that after each retreat,\r\nPaganini appeared with brand-new effects which electrified his\r\nhearers--\"effects taught him by the devil.\"\r\n\r\nConstant appearing before vast multitudes and ceaseless travel create a\r\ndepletion that demands rest. Paganini held the balance true by fleeing\r\nto the mountains; there he worked and prayed. That Paganini had a soft\r\nheart, in spite of the silent, cold and melancholy mood that usually\r\npossessed him, is shown in his treatment of his father and mother, who\r\nlived to know the greatness of their son. He wrote his mother kind and\r\naffectionate letters, some of which we have, and provided lavishly for\r\nevery want of both his parents. At times he gave concerts for charity,\r\nand on these occasions vast sums were realized.\r\n\r\nPaganini died in Eighteen Hundred Forty, aged fifty-six years. His will\r\nprovided for legacies to various men and women who had befriended him,\r\nand he also gave to others with whom he had quarreled, thus proving he\r\nwas not all clay.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of his fortune, equal to half a million dollars, was bequeathed\r\nto his son, Baron Achille Paganini. And as if mystery should still\r\nenshroud his memory and this, true to his nature, should be carried out\r\nin his last will, there are those who maintain that Achille Paganini was\r\nnot his son at all--only a waif he had adopted. Yet Achille always\r\nstoutly maintained the distinction--but what boots it, since he could\r\nnot play his father's violin?\r\n\r\nYet this we know--Paganini, the man of mystery and moods, once lived and\r\nproduced music that, Orpheus-like, transfixed the world. We are better\r\nfor his having been and this world is a nobler place in that he lived\r\nand played, for listen closely and you can hear, even now, the sweet,\r\nsad echoes of those vibrant strings, touched by the hand of him who\r\nloved them well.\r\n\r\nAnd when we remember the prodigious amount of practise that Paganini\r\nschooled himself to in youth; and join this to the recently discovered\r\nrecord of his long monastic retreats, when for months he worked and\r\nplayed and prayed, we can guess the secret of his power. If you wish me\r\nto present you a recipe for doing a deathless performance, I would give\r\nyou this: Work, travel, solitude, prayer, and yet again--work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FREDERIC CHOPIN]\r\n\r\nFREDERIC CHOPIN\r\n\r\n\r\n     Nature does not design like art, however realistic she may be. She\r\n     has caprices, inconsequences, probably not real, but very\r\n     mysterious. Art only rectifies these inconsequences, because it is\r\n     too limited to reproduce them. Chopin was a resume of these\r\n     inconsequences which God alone can allow Himself to create, and\r\n     which have their particular logic. He was modest on principle,\r\n     gentle by habit, but he was imperious by instinct and full of a\r\n     legitimate pride which was unconscious of itself. Hence arose\r\n     sufferings which he did not reason and which did not fix themselves\r\n     on a determined object.\r\n\r\n     --_George Sand in \"The Story of My Life\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nFREDERIC CHOPIN\r\n\r\nMaybe I am all wrong about it, yet I can not help believing that the\r\nspirit of man will live again somewhere in a better world than ours.\r\nFenelon says, \"Justice demands another life in order to make good the\r\ninequalities of this.\" Astronomers prophesy the existence of stars long\r\nbefore they can see them. They know where they ought to be, and training\r\ntheir telescopes in that direction they wait, knowing they will find.\r\n\r\nMaterially, no one can imagine anything more beautiful than this earth,\r\nfor the simple reason that we can not imagine anything we have not seen;\r\nwe may make new combinations, but the whole is all made up of parts of\r\nthings with which we are familiar. This great green earth out of which\r\nwe have sprung, of which we are a part, that supports our bodies, and to\r\nwhich our bodies must return to repay the loan, is very, very beautiful.\r\n\r\nBut the spirit of man is not fully at home here; as we grow in soul and\r\nintellect, we hear, and hear again, a voice which says, \"Arise and get\r\nthee hence, for this is not thy rest.\" And the greater and nobler and\r\nmore sublime the spirit, the more constant the discontent. Discontent\r\nmay come from various causes, so it will not do to assume that the\r\ndiscontented are always the pure in heart, but it is a fact that the\r\nwise and excellent have all known the meaning of world-weariness. The\r\nmore you study and appreciate this life, the more sure you are that this\r\nis not all. You pillow your head upon Mother Earth, listen to her\r\nheart-throb, and even as your spirit is filled with the love of her,\r\nyour gladness is half-pain and there comes to you a joy that hurts.\r\n\r\nTo look upon the most exalted forms of beauty, such as a sunset at sea,\r\nthe coming of a storm on the prairie, the shadowy silence of the desert,\r\nor the sublime majesty of the mountains, begets a sense of sadness, an\r\nincreasing loneliness.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough to say that man encroaches on man so that we are really\r\ndeprived of our freedom, that civilization is caused by a bacillus, and\r\nthat from a natural condition we have gotten into a hurly-burly where\r\nrivalry is rife--all this may be true, but beyond and outside of all\r\nthis there is no physical environment in way of plenty which earth can\r\nsupply, that will give the tired soul peace. They are the happiest who\r\nhave the least; and the fable of the stricken king and the shirtless\r\nbeggar contains the germ of truth. The wise hold all earthly ties very\r\nlightly--they are stripping for eternity.\r\n\r\nWorld-weariness is only a desire for a better spiritual condition. There\r\nis more to be written on this subject of world-pain--to exhaust the\r\ntheme would require a book. And certain it is that I have no wish to\r\nsay the final word on any topic. The gentle reader has certain rights,\r\nand among these is the privilege of summing up the case. But the fact\r\nholds that world-pain is a form of desire. All desires are just, proper\r\nand right; and their gratification is the means by which Nature supplies\r\nus that which we need. Desire not only causes us to seek that which we\r\nneed, but is a form of attraction by which the good is brought to us,\r\njust as the ameba creates a swirl in the waters that brings its food\r\nwithin reach. Every desire in Nature has a fixed, definite purpose in\r\nthe Divine Economy, and every desire has its proper gratification. If we\r\ndesire the friendship of a certain person, it is because that person has\r\ncertain soul-qualities that we do not possess, and which complement our\r\nown. Through desire do we come into possession of our own; by submitting\r\nto its beckonings we add cubits to our stature; and we also give out to\r\nothers our own attributes, without becoming poorer, for soul is not\r\nlimited.\r\n\r\nAll Nature is a symbol of spirit, so I believe that somewhere there must\r\nbe a proper gratification for this mysterious nostalgia of the soul. The\r\nEternal Unities require a condition where men and women will live to\r\nlove, and not to sorrow; where the tyranny of things hated shall not\r\never prevail, nor that for which the heart yearns turn to ashes at our\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I believe Stevie is not quite at home here--he'll not remain so very\r\nlong,\" said a woman to me in Eighteen Hundred Ninety-five. Five years\r\nhave gone by, and recently the cable flashed the news that Stephen Crane\r\nwas dead.\r\n\r\nDead at twenty-nine, with ten books to his credit, two of them good,\r\nwhich is two good books more than most of us scribblers will ever write.\r\nYes, Stephen Crane wrote two things that are immortal. \"The Red Badge of\r\nCourage\" is the strongest, most vivid work of imagination ever fished\r\nfrom an ink-pot by an American.\r\n\r\n\"Men who write from the imagination are helpless when in presence of the\r\nfact,\" said James Russell Lowell. In answer to which I'll point you \"The\r\nOpen Boat,\" the sternest, creepiest bit of realism ever penned, and\r\nStevie was in the boat.\r\n\r\nAmerican critics honored Stephen Crane with more ridicule, abuse and\r\nunkind comment than was bestowed on any other writer of his time.\r\nPossibly the vagueness, and the loose, unsleeked quality of his work\r\ninvited the gibes, jeers, and the loud laughter that tokens the vacant\r\nmind; yet as half-apology for the critics we might say that scathing\r\ncriticism never killed good work; and this is true, but it sometimes has\r\nkilled the man.\r\n\r\nStephen Crane never answered back, nor made explanation, but that he was\r\nstung by the continued efforts of the press to laugh him down, I am very\r\nsure.\r\n\r\nThe lack of appreciation at home caused him to shake the dust of\r\nAmerica from his feet and take up his abode across the sea, where his\r\ngenius was being recognized, and where strong men stretched out sinewy\r\nhands of welcome, and words of appreciation were heard, instead of\r\nsilly, insulting parody. In passing, it is well to note that the five\r\nstrongest writers of America had their passports to greatness viséed in\r\nEngland before they were granted recognition at home. I refer to Walt\r\nWhitman, Thoreau, Emerson, Poe and Stephen Crane.\r\n\r\nStevie did not know he cared for approbation, but his constant refusal\r\nto read what the newspapers said about him was proof that he did. He\r\nboycotted the tribe of Romeike, because he knew that nine clippings out\r\nof every ten would be unkind, and his sensitive soul shrank from the\r\npin-pricks.\r\n\r\nContemporary estimates are usually wrong, and Crane is only another of\r\nthe long list of men of genius to whom Fame brings a wreath and finds\r\nher poet dead.\r\n\r\nStephen Crane was a reincarnation of Frederic Chopin. Both were small in\r\nstature, slight, fair-haired, and of that sensitive, acute, receptive\r\ntemperament--capable of highest joy and keyed for exquisite pain.\r\nHaunted with the prophetic vision of quick-coming death, and with the\r\nhectic desire to get their work done, they often toiled the night away\r\nand were surprised by the rays of the rising sun. Both were shrinking\r\nyet proud, shy but bold, with a tenderness and a feminine longing for\r\nlove that earth could not requite. At times mad gaiety, that ill-masked\r\na breaking heart, took the reins, and the spirits of children just out\r\nof school seemed to hold the road. At other times--and this was the\r\nprevailing mood--the manner was one of placid, patient, calm and smooth,\r\nunruffled hope; but back and behind all was a dynamo of energy, a\r\nbrooding melancholy of unrest, and the crouching world-sorrow that would\r\nnot down.\r\n\r\nChopin reached sublimity through sweet sounds; Crane attained the same\r\nheights through the sense of sight and words that symboled color, shapes\r\nand scenes. In each the distinguishing feature is the intense\r\nimagination and active sympathy. Knowledge consists in a sense of\r\nvalues--of distinguishing this from that, for truth lies in the mass.\r\nThe delicate nuances of Chopin's music have never been equaled by\r\nanother composer; every note is cryptic, every sound a symbol. And yet\r\nit is dance-music, too, but still it tells its story of baffled hope and\r\nstifled desire--the tragedy of Poland in sweet sounds.\r\n\r\nStephen Crane was an artist in his ability to convey the feeling by just\r\nthe right word, or a word misplaced, like a lady's dress in disarray, or\r\na hat askew. This daring quality marks everything he wrote. The\r\nrecognition that language is fluid, and at best only an expedient,\r\nflavors all his work. He makes no fetish of a grammar--if grammar gets\r\nin the way, so much the worse for the grammar. All is packed with color,\r\nand charged with feeling, yet the work is usually quiet in quality and\r\nmodest in manner.\r\n\r\nArt is born of heart, not head; and so it seems to me that the work of\r\nthese men whose names I have somewhat arbitrarily linked, will live.\r\nEach sowed in sorrow and reaped in grief. They were tender, kind,\r\ngentle, with a capacity for love that passes the love of woman. They\r\nwere each indifferent to the proprieties, very much as children are.\r\nThey lived in cloister-like retirement, hidden from the public gaze, or\r\nwandered unnoticed and unknown. They founded no schools, delivered no\r\npublic addresses, and in their own day made small impress on the times.\r\nBoth were sublimely indifferent to what had been said and done--the term\r\nprecedent not being found within the covers of their bright lexicon of\r\nwords. In the nature of each was a goodly trace of peroxide of iron that\r\noften manifested itself in the man's work.\r\n\r\nThe faults in each spring from an intense personality, uncolored by the\r\nsurroundings, and such faults in such men are virtues.\r\n\r\nThey belong to that elect few who have built for the centuries. The\r\ninfluence of Chopin, beyond that of other composers, is alive today, and\r\nmoves unconsciously, but profoundly, every music-maker; the seemingly\r\ncareless style of Crane is really lapidaric, and is helping to file the\r\nfetters from every writer who has ideas plus, and thoughts that burn.\r\n\r\nMother Nature in giving out energy gives each man about an equal\r\nportion. But that ability to throw the weight with the blow, to\r\nconcentrate the soul in a sonnet, to focus force in a single effort, is\r\nthe possession of God's Chosen Few. Chopin put his affection, his\r\npatriotism, his wrath, his hope, and his heroism into his music--as if\r\nthe song of all the forest birds could be secured, sealed and saved for\r\nus!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe father of Chopin was a Frenchman who went up to Poland seeking gain\r\nand adventure. He became a soldier under Kosciusko and arose to rank of\r\nCaptain. He found such favor with the nobility by his gracious ways that\r\nhe became a teacher of French in the family of Count Frederic Skarbek.\r\nIn the family group was a fair young dependent of nervous\r\ntemperament--slight, active, gentle and intelligent. She was descendent\r\nfrom a line of aristocrats, but in a country where revolutions have been\r\nknown to begin and end before breakfast, titles stand for little.\r\n\r\nNicholas Chopin, ex-soldier, teacher of French and Deportment, married\r\nthis fine young girl, and they lived in one of Count Skarbek's\r\nstraw-thatched cottages at the little village of Zelazowa-Wola,\r\ntwenty-nine miles from Warsaw. Here it was that Frederic Chopin was\r\nborn, in Eighteen Hundred Nine--that memorable year when Destiny sent a\r\nflight of great souls to the planet Earth.\r\n\r\nThe country was bleak and battle-scarred; it had been drained of its men\r\nand treasure, and served as a dueling-ground and the place of skulls for\r\nkings and such riffraff who have polluted this fair world with their\r\nboastings of a divine power.\r\n\r\nThe struggle of Poland to free herself from the grip of the imperial\r\nsuccubi has generated an atmosphere of ultramarine, so we view the\r\nlittle land of patriots (and fanatics) through a mist of melancholy.\r\nThe history of Poland is written in blood and tears.\r\n\r\nGo ask John Sobieski, who saw his father hanged by order of Ferdinand\r\nMaximilian, and child though he was, realized that banishment was the\r\nfate of himself and mother; and then ten years after, himself, stood\r\ndeath-guard over this same Maximilian in Mexico, and told that tyrant\r\nthe story of his life, and shook hands with him, calling it quits, ere\r\nthe bandage was tied over the eyes of the ex-dictator and the sunlight\r\nshut out forever.\r\n\r\nGo ask John Sobieski!\r\n\r\nThe woes of Poland have produced strange men. Under such rule as she has\r\nknown relentless hate springs up in otherwise gracious hearts from the\r\nscattered dragons' teeth; and in other natures, where there is not quite\r\nso much of the motive temperament, a deep strain of sorrow and religious\r\nmelancholy finds expression. The exquisite sensibility, delicate\r\ninsight, proud reserve and brooding world-sorrow of Frederic Chopin were\r\nthe inheritance of mother to son. This mother's mind was saturated with\r\nthe wrongs her people had endured: she herself had suffered every\r\ncontumely, for where chance had caused fact to falter, imagination had\r\nfilled the void.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to say that Chopin's was an abnormal nature, and of course it\r\nwas, but when disease divides this world from another only by the\r\nthinnest veil, the mind has been known to see things with a clearness\r\nand vividness never before attained. With Chopin the strands of life\r\nwere often taut to the breaking-point, but ere they snapped, their\r\nvibration gave forth to us some exquisite harmonies.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, this power to see and do is often the possession of\r\ndying men. The life flares up in a flame before it goes out forever. The\r\npassion of the consumptive Camille, as portrayed by Dumas, is\r\ntypical--no healthy woman ever loved with that same intense, eager and\r\nalmost vindictive desire. It was a race with Death.\r\n\r\nPerfect health brings unconsciousness of body, and disease that almost\r\nrelieves the spirit of this weight of flesh produces the same results.\r\nAgain we have the Law of Antithesis.\r\n\r\nThat such a youth as Frederic Chopin should seek in music a surcease\r\nfrom his world-sorrow is very natural. A stricken people turns to music;\r\nit forms a necessary part of all religious observance, and the dirge of\r\nmourners, the wail of the \"keener,\" and the songs of the banshee evolve\r\nnaturally into being wherever the heart is sore oppressed. It was the\r\nslave-songs that made slavery bearable; and in the long ago, exiles in\r\nBabylon found a solemn joy by singing the songs of Zion. Chopin drank in\r\nthe songs of Poland with his mother's milk, and while yet a child began\r\nto give them voice in his own way.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime his father's fortunes had mended a bit, and the family\r\nhad moved to Warsaw, where Nicholas Chopin was Professor of Languages at\r\nthe Lyceum. The title of the office fills the mouth in a very satisfying\r\nway, but the emoluments attached hardly afforded such a gratification.\r\n\r\nIn Warsaw there was much misery, for the plunderer had worked\r\nconscription and seizure to its furthest limit. Want and destitution\r\nwere on every hand, but still this brave people maintained their\r\nUniversity and clung to its traditions. The family of the Professor of\r\nLanguages consisted of himself, wife, three daughters and the son\r\nFrederic. Their income for several years was not over fifteen dollars a\r\nmonth, but still they managed to maintain an appearance of decency, and\r\nby the help of the public library, the free museum and the open-air\r\nconcerts, they kept abreast of the times in literature, art and music.\r\n\r\nThere was absolute economy required, every particle of food was saved,\r\nand when cast-off dresses were sent from the home of the Count it was a\r\ngodsend for the mother and girls, who measured and patched and pieced,\r\nmaking garments for themselves, and for Frederic as well; so while their\r\nraiment was not gaudy nor expressed in fancy, it served.\r\n\r\nChopin once said to George Sand, \"I never can think of my mother without\r\nher knitting-needles!\" And George Sand has recorded, \"Frederic never had\r\nbut one passion and that was his mother.\" Into all of her knitting this\r\nmother's flying needles worked much love. The entire household was one\r\nof mutual service, and gentle, trusting affection. The weekly letters of\r\nChopin to his mother from Paris, and the cold sweat on his forehead at\r\nthe thought of his parents knowing of his relationship with George Sand,\r\nare credit-marks to his character. There is a sweet recompense in mutual\r\ndeprivation where trials and difficulties only serve to cement the\r\naffections; and who shall say how much the wondrous blending of strength\r\nand delicacy in the music of Chopin is due to the memory of those early\r\ndays of toil and trial, of strength and forbearance, of hope and love?\r\n\r\nTo be born into such a family is a great blessing. The value of the\r\nenvironment is shown in that all three of the sisters became\r\ndistinguished in literature. Two of them married men of intellect,\r\nwealth and worth, and through the collaboration of these sisters, books\r\nwere produced that did for the plain people of Poland what Harriet\r\nMartineau's books on sociology did for the people of England. Frederic\r\nplayed and practised at the Lyceum where his father taught, and the\r\nambition of his parents was that he should grow up and take the place of\r\nProfessor of Music in the Lyceum. Adalbert Zevyny, one of the leading\r\npianists in the city, became attracted to the boy and took him as a\r\npupil, without pay.\r\n\r\nThe teacher soon became a little boastful of his precocious pupil, and\r\nwhen there came a public concert for the benefit of the poor, we find\r\nreference made to Chopin thus, \"A child not yet eight years of age\r\nplayed, and connoisseurs say he promises to replace Mozart.\" In reality\r\nthe boy was nearer twelve than eight, but his size and looks suggested\r\nto the management the idea of plagiarizing, in advance, our honored\r\ncountryman, Phineas T. Barnum. Hence the announcement on the programs.\r\n\r\nBut now the nobility of the neighborhood began to send carriages for the\r\nfair-haired lad, so he could play for their invited guests. Then came\r\nsnug little honorariums that soon replaced his patched-up wardrobe for\r\nsomething more fashionable.\r\n\r\nFrederic took all the applause quite as a matter of course, and on one\r\noccasion, after he had played divinely, he asked a proud lady this\r\nquestion, \"How do you like my new collar?\"\r\n\r\nHe was to the manner born, and the gentle blood of his mother formed him\r\nas a fit companion for aristocrats.\r\n\r\nThese occasional musicales at the houses of the great made money matters\r\neasier, and Frederic began to take lessons from Joseph Elsner, who\r\ntaught him the science of composition, and introduced him into the\r\ndeeper mysteries of music-making. Elsner, it was, more than any other\r\nman, who forced the truth upon Chopin that he must play to satisfy\r\nhimself, and in composition be his own most exacting critic. In other\r\nwords, Elsner developed and strengthened in Chopin the artistic\r\nconscience--that impulse which causes an artist to scorn doing anything\r\nsave his best.\r\n\r\nFrom little excursions to neighboring towns and country houses about\r\nWarsaw, Chopin now ventured farther away from home, chaperoned by his\r\nfriend, Prince Radziwill. He visited Berlin, Venice, Prague, Heidelberg,\r\nand mingled on an absolute equality with the nobility. If they had\r\ntitles, he had talents. And his talents often made their decorations\r\nsing small.\r\n\r\nHis modesty was witching, and while in public concerts his playing was\r\nnot pronounced enough to capture the gallery, yet in small gatherings he\r\nwon all hearts, and the fact that he played his own compositions made\r\nhim an added object of enthusiasm to the elect. Chopin arrived in Paris\r\nwhen he was twenty-two years of age. It was not his intention to remain\r\nmore than a few weeks, but Paris was to be his home for eighteen\r\nyears--and then Pere la Chaise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA woman who beholds her thirtieth birthday in sight, and girlhood gone,\r\nis approaching a climacteric in her career. Flaubert has named\r\ntwenty-nine as the eventful year in the life of woman, and thirty-three\r\nfor men. Every normal woman craves love and tenderness--these are her\r\nGod-given right. If they have not come to her by the time the bloom is\r\nfading from her cheeks, there is danger of her reaching out and\r\nclutching for them. The strongest instinct in young girls is\r\nself-protection--they fight on the defensive. But at thirty, women have\r\nbeen known to grow a trifle anxious, just as did the Sabine women who\r\ndispatched a messenger to the Romans asking this question, \"How soon\r\ndoes the program begin?\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus are conditions reversed, for it is the youth of twenty or so\r\nwho seeks conquest with fiery soul. Alexander was only nineteen when he\r\nsighed for more worlds to conquer. He didn't have to wait long before he\r\nfound that this one had conquered him. Youth considers itself immortal,\r\nand its powers without limit, but as a man approaches thirty he grows\r\neconomical of his resources and parsimonious of his emotions. Men of\r\nthirty, or so, are apt to be coy.\r\n\r\nAnd so one might say that it is around thirty that for the first time\r\nthe man and the woman meet on an equality, without sham, shame or\r\npretense. Before that time the average woman abounds in affectation and\r\nuntruth; the man is absurdly aggressive and full of foolish flattery.\r\n\r\nAs to the question, \"Should women propose?\" the answer is, \"Yes,\r\ncertainly, and they do when they are twenty-nine.\"\r\n\r\nAurora Dudevant saw her thirtieth birthday looming on the horizon of her\r\nlife. Nine years before she had been married to an ex-army-officer, who\r\ndyed his whiskers purple. Aurora had been a dutiful wife, intent for the\r\nfirst few years on filling her husband's heart and home with joy. She\r\nhad failed in this, and the proof of failure lay in that he much\r\npreferred his dogs, guns and horses to her society. For days he would\r\nabsent himself on his hunting excursions, and at home he did not have\r\nthe tact to hide the fact that he was awfully bored.\r\n\r\nThackeray, once for all, has given us a picture of the heavy dragoon\r\nwith a soul for dogs--one to whom all music, save the bay of a\r\nfox-hound, makes its appeal in vain. Aurore detested dogs for dogs'\r\nsake, yet she rode horses astride with a daring that made her husband's\r\nbloodshot eyes bulge in alarm. He didn't much care how fast and hard she\r\nrode at the fences and over the ditches, but he was supposed to follow\r\nher, and this he did not care to do. He had reached an age when a man is\r\nmindful of the lime in his bones, and his 'cross-country riding was\r\nmostly a matter of memory and imagination, and best done around the\r\nconvivial table.\r\n\r\nAurore was putting him to a test, that's all. She was proving to him\r\nthat she could meet him on his own preserve, give him choice of weapons,\r\nand make him cry for mercy.\r\n\r\nHer bent was literature, with music, science and art as side-lines. She\r\nread Montaigne, Rochefoucald, Racine and Moliere, and a modern by the\r\nname of Alfred de Musset, and quoted her authors at inconvenient times.\r\nShe flashed quotations and epigrams upon the doughty dragoon in a way he\r\ncould neither fend nor parry. At other times she was deeply religious\r\nand tearfully penitent.\r\n\r\nIn fact, she was living on a skimped allowance of love, and had never\r\nreceived the attention that a good woman deserves. Her chains were\r\ngalling her. She sighed for Paris--forty miles away--Paris and a career.\r\n\r\nThe epigrams were coming faster, shot in a sort of frenzy and fever. And\r\nwhen she asked her liege for leave to go to Paris, he granted her\r\nprayer, and agreed to give her ten dollars a week allowance.\r\n\r\nShe grabbed at the offer, and he bade her Godspeed and good riddance.\r\n\r\nSo leaving her two children behind, until such a time as she could\r\nprovide a home for them, with scanty luggage and light heart and purse,\r\nshe started away.\r\n\r\nOther women have gone up to Paris from country towns, too, and the\r\nchances are as one to ten thousand that the maelstrom will sweep them\r\ninto hades.\r\n\r\nBut Madame Dudevant was different--in two years she had won her way to\r\nliterary fame, and was commanding the jealous admiration of the best\r\nwriters of Paris. Her first work was a collaboration with Jules\r\nSandeau in a novel. Every woman who ever wrote well began by\r\ncollaborating with a man. Sandeau had formerly come from Nohant, and how\r\nmuch he had to do with Madame Dudevant's breaking loose from her\r\nhomes-ties no one knows. Anyway, the second novel was written by the\r\nMadame alone, and as a tribute to her friend the name \"George Sand\" was\r\nplaced upon the title-page as author. Jules Sandeau, all-'round\r\nhack-writer and critic, was greatly pleased by the compliment of having\r\nhis name anglicized and printed on the title-page of \"Indiana,\" but\r\nlater he was not so proud of it. George Sand soon proved herself to be a\r\nbigger man than Sandeau.\r\n\r\nShe was not handsome, either in face or in form. She was inclined to be\r\nstout--was rather short--and her complexion olive. But she lured with\r\nher eyes--great sphinx-like eyes of hazel-brown--that looked men through\r\nand through. Liszt has told us that \"she had eyes like a cow,\" which is\r\nnot so bad as Thomas Carlyle's remark that George Eliot had a face like\r\na horse. George Sand was silent when other women talked, and her look\r\ntold in a half-proud, half-sad way that she knew all they knew, and all\r\nshe herself knew beside.\r\n\r\nWithout going into the issue as to what George Sand was not, let us\r\nfrankly admit that pain, deprivation, misunderstanding and maternity had\r\ntaught her many things not found in books, and that she looked at Fate\r\nout of her wide-open eyes with a gaze that did not blink. She was wise\r\nbeyond the lot of women. I was just going to say she was a genius, but I\r\nremember the remark of the De Goncourts to the effect that, \"There are\r\nno women of genius--women of genius are men.\" Possibly the point could\r\nbe covered by saying George Sand had a man's head and a woman's heart.\r\n\r\nWomen did not like her, yet what other woman was ever so honored by\r\nwoman as was George Sand in those two matchless sonnets addressed to her\r\nby Elizabeth Barrett Browning?\r\n\r\nThe amazing energy of George Sand, her finely flowing sentences--all\r\ncharged with daring satire and insight into the heart of things--made\r\nher work sought by readers and publishers. Her pen brought her all the\r\nmoney she needed; and she had secured a divorce from \"That Man,\" and now\r\nhad her two children with her in Paris. That she could do her literary\r\nwork and still attend to her manifold social duties must ever mark her\r\nas a phenomenon. She was no mere adventuress. That she was systematic,\r\norderly and abstemious in her habits must go without saying, otherwise\r\nher vitality would not have held out and allowed her to attend the\r\nfunerals of nearly all her retainers.\r\n\r\nIn throwing overboard the Grub Street Sandeau for Franz Liszt, Madame\r\nDudevant certainly showed discrimination; but in retaining the name of\r\n\"Sand,\" she paid a delicate compliment to the man who first introduced\r\nher to the world of art. Liszt was too strong a man to remain long\r\ncaptive--he refused to supply the doglike and abject devotion which\r\nAurore always demanded. Then came Michael de Bourges the learned\r\ncounsel, Calmatto the mezzotinter, Delacroix the artist, De Musset the\r\npoet, and Chopin the musician.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year Eighteen Hundred Thirty-nine, that Chopin and Sand\r\nfirst met at a parlor musicale, where Chopin was taken by Liszt, half\r\nagainst his will, simply because George Sand was to be there.\r\n\r\nChopin did not want to meet her.\r\n\r\nAll Paris had rung with the story of how she and De Musset had gone\r\ntogether to Venice, and then in less than a year had quarreled and\r\nseparated. Both made good copy of the \"poetic interval,\" as George Sand\r\ncalled it. Chopin was not a stickler for conventionalities, but George\r\nSand's history, for him, proved her to be coarse and devoid of all the\r\nfiner feeling that we prize in women.\r\n\r\nChopin had no fear of her--not he--only he did not care to add to his\r\ncircle of acquaintances one so lacking in inward grace and delicacy.\r\n\r\nHe played at the musicale--it was all very informal--and George Sand\r\npushed her way up through the throng that stood about the piano and\r\nlooked at the handsome boy as he played--she looked at him with her big,\r\nhazel, cow eyes, steadfastly, yearningly, and he glancing up, saw the\r\neyes were filled with tears.\r\n\r\nWhen the playing ceased, she still stood looking at the great musician,\r\nand then she leaned over the piano and whispered, \"Your playing makes me\r\nlive over again every pain that has ever wrung my heart; and every joy,\r\ntoo, that I have ever known is mine again.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter their first meeting, when Chopin played at a musicale, George Sand\r\nwas apt to be there too--they often came together. She was five years\r\nolder than he, and looked fifteen, for his slight figure and delicate,\r\nboyish face gave him the appearance of youth unto the very last. In\r\nletters to Madame Mariana, George Sand often refers to Chopin as \"My\r\nLittle One,\" and when some one spoke of him as \"The Chopinetto,\" the\r\nname seemed to stick.\r\n\r\nThat she was the man in the partnership is very evident. He really\r\nneeded some one to look after him, provide mustard-plasters and run for\r\nthe camphor and hot-water bottle. He was the one who did the weeping and\r\npouting, and had the \"nerves\" and made the scenes; while she, on such\r\noccasions, would viciously roll a cigarette, swear under her breath,\r\nconsole and pooh-pooh.\r\n\r\nLiszt has told us how, on one occasion, she had gone out at night for a\r\nstorm-walk, and Chopin, being too ill, or disinclined to go, remained at\r\nhome. Upon her return she found him in a conniption, he having composed\r\na prelude to ward off an attack of cold feet, and was now ready to\r\nscream through fear that something had happened to her. As she entered\r\nthe door he arose, staggered and fell before her in a fainting fit.\r\n\r\nA whole literature has grown up around the relations of Chopin and\r\nGeorge Sand, and the lady in the case has, herself, set forth her brief\r\nwith painstaking detail in her \"Histoire de Ma Vie.\" With De Musset,\r\nGeorge Sand had to reckon on dealing with a writing man, and his\r\naccounts of \"The Little White Blackbird\" had taught her caution.\r\nThereafter she abjured the litterateurs, excepting when in her old age\r\nshe allowed Gustave Flaubert to come within her sacred circle--but her\r\nfriendship with Flaubert was placidly platonic, as all the world knows.\r\nAnd so were her relations with Chopin, provided we accept her version as\r\ngospel fact.\r\n\r\nGeorge Sand lacked the frankness of Rousseau; but I think we should be\r\nwilling to accept the lady's statements, for she was present and really\r\nthe only one in possession of the facts, excepting, of course, Chopin,\r\nand he was not a writer. He could express himself only at the keyboard,\r\nand the piano is no graphophone, for which let us all be duly thankful.\r\nSo we are without Chopin's side of the story. We, however, have some\r\nvigorous writing by a man by the name of Hadow.\r\n\r\nMr. Hadow enters the lists panoplied with facts, and declares that the\r\nfriendship was strictly platonic, being on the woman's side of a purely\r\nmaternal order. Chopin was sick and friendless, and Madame Dudevant,\r\nknowing his worth to the art world, succored him--nursing him as a\r\nSister of Charity might, sacrificing herself, and even risking her\r\nreputation in order to restore him to life and health.\r\n\r\nAnd this view of the case I am quite willing to accept. Mr. Hadow is no\r\njoker, like that man who has recently written an appreciation of\r\nXantippe, showing that the wife of Socrates was one of the most patient\r\nwomen who ever lived, and only at times resorted to heroic means in\r\norder to drive her husband out into the world of thought. She willingly\r\nsacrificed her own good name that another might have literary life.\r\n\r\nHadow has gotten all the facts together and then dispassionately drawn\r\nhis conclusions; and these conclusions are eminently complimentary to\r\nall parties concerned.\r\n\r\nIt was only a few months after Chopin met George Sand that he was\r\nattacked with a peculiar hacking cough. His friends were sure it was\r\nconsumption, and a leading physician gave it as his opinion that if the\r\npatient spent the approaching Winter in Paris, it would be death in\r\nMarch.\r\n\r\nThe facts being brought to the notice of George Sand, she had but one\r\nthought--to save the life of this young man. He was too ill to decide\r\nwhat was best to do, and was never able by temperament to take the\r\ninitiative, anyway, so this strong and capable woman, forgetful of self\r\nand her own interests, made all the arrangements and took him to the\r\nIsle of Majorca in the Mediterranean Sea. There she cared for him alone\r\nas she might for a babe, for six long, weary months. They lived in the\r\ncells of an old monastery at Valdemosa, away up on the mountainside\r\noverlooking the sea. Here where the roses bloomed the whole year\r\nthrough, surrounded by groves of orange-trees, shut in by vines and\r\nflowers, with no society save that of the sacristan and an aged woman\r\nservant, she nursed the death-stricken man back to life and hope.\r\n\r\nTo better encourage him she sent for and surprised him with his piano,\r\nwhich had to be carried up the mountain on the backs of mules. In the\r\nquiet cloisters she cared for him with motherly tenderness, and there he\r\nlearned again to awake the slumbering echoes with divine music. Several\r\nof his best pieces were composed at Majorca during his convalescence,\r\nwhere the soft semi-tropical breeze laved his cheek, the birds warbled\r\nhim their sweetest carols, and away down below, the sea, mother of all,\r\nsang her ceaseless lullaby. When they returned to France the following\r\nSpring, M. Dudevant had accommodatingly vacated the family residence at\r\nNohant in favor of his wife. It was here she took the convalescent\r\nChopin. He was charmed with the rambling old house, its walled-in\r\ngardens with their arbors of clustering grapes, and the green meadows\r\nstretching down to the water's edge, where the little river ran its way\r\nto the ocean.\r\n\r\nBack of the house was a great forest of mighty trees, beneath whose\r\nthick shade the sun's rays never entered, and a half-mile away arose the\r\nspire of the village church. There were no neighbors, save a cheery old\r\npriest, and the simple villagers who made respectful obeisance as they\r\npassed. Here it was that Matthew Arnold came to pay his tribute to\r\ngenius, also Liszt and the fair Countess d'Agoult, Delacroix, Renan,\r\nLamennais, Lamartine, and so many others of the great and excellent.\r\nChopin was enchanted with the place, and refused to go back to Paris.\r\nMadame Dudevant insisted, and explained to him that she took him to\r\nMajorca to spend the Winter, but she had no intention or thought of\r\ncaring for him longer than the few months that might be required to\r\nrestore him to health. But he cried and clung to her with such\r\nhalf-childish fright that she had not the heart to send him away.\r\n\r\nThe summer months passed and the leaves began to turn scarlet and gold,\r\nand he only consented to return to Paris on her agreeing to go with him.\r\nSo they returned together, and had rooms not so very far apart.\r\n\r\nHe went back sturdily to his music-teaching, with an occasional\r\nmusicale, yet gave but one public concert in the space of ten years.\r\n\r\nThe exquisite quality of Chopin's playing appealed only to the sacred\r\nfew, but his piano scores were slowly finding sale, through the\r\nadvertisement they received by being played by Liszt, Tausig and others.\r\nYet the critics almost uniformly condemned his work as bizarre and\r\nerratic.\r\n\r\nEach Summer he spent at lovely Nohant, and there found the rest and\r\nquiet which got nerves back to the norm and allowed him to go on with\r\nhis work. So passed the years away. Of this we are very sure--no taint\r\nexists on the record of Chopin excepting possibly his relationship with\r\nGeorge Sand. That he endeavored to win her full heart's love, for the\r\npurpose of honorable marriage, Mr. Hadow is fully convinced. But when\r\nhis suit failed, after an eight years' courtship, and the lover was\r\ndiscarded, he ceased to work. His heart was broken; he lingered on for\r\ntwo years, and then death claimed him at the early age of forty years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is a tendency to judge a work of art by its size. Thus the\r\nsculptor who does a \"heroic figure\" is the man who looms large to the\r\naverage visitor at the art-gallery.\r\n\r\nChopin wrote no lengthy symphonies, oratorios or operas. His music is\r\npoetry set to exquisite sounds. Poetry is an ecstasy of the spirit, and\r\necstasies in their very nature are not sustained moods.\r\n\r\nThe poetic mood is transient. A composition by Chopin is a soul-ecstasy,\r\nlike unto the singing of a lark.\r\n\r\nNo other man but Chopin should have been allowed to set the songs of\r\nShelley to music. With such names as Shelley, Keats, Poe and Crane must\r\nChopin's name be linked.\r\n\r\nIn Chopin's music there is much loose texture; there are wide-meshed\r\nchords, daring leaps and abrupt arpeggios. These have often been pointed\r\nout as faults, but such harmonious discords are now properly valued, and\r\nwe see that Chopin's lapses all had meaning and purpose, in that they\r\nimpart a feeling--making their appeal to souls that have suffered--souls\r\nthat know.\r\n\r\nMore of Chopin's music is sold in America every year than was sold\r\naltogether during the lifetime of the composer. His name and fame grow\r\nwith each year. Everywhere--wherever a piano is played--on concert\r\nplatform, in studio or private parlor, there you will find the work of\r\nFrederic Chopin. That such a widespread distribution must have a potent\r\nand powerful effect upon the race goes without argument, although the\r\nfurthest limit of that influence no man can mark. It is registered with\r\nInfinity alone. And thus does that modest, mild and gentle revolutionist\r\nFrederic Chopin live again in minds made better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHUMANN]\r\n\r\nROBERT SCHUMANN\r\n\r\n\r\n     Beneath these flowers I dream, a silent chord. I can not wake my\r\n     own strings to music; but under the hands of those who comprehend\r\n     me, I become an eloquent friend. Wanderer, ere thou goest, try me!\r\n     The more trouble thou takest with me, the more lovely will be the\r\n     tones with which I shall reward thee.\r\n\r\n     --_Robert Schumann_\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT SCHUMANN\r\n\r\nThat any man should ever write his thoughts for other men to read, seems\r\nthe very height of egoism.\r\n\r\nLiterature never dies, and so the person who writes constitutes himself\r\na rival of Shakespeare and seeks to lure us from Montaigne, Milton,\r\nEmerson and Carlyle. To write nothing better than grammatical English,\r\nto punctuate properly, and repeat thoughts in the same sequence that\r\nhave been repeated a thousand times, is to do something icily regular,\r\nsplendidly null.\r\n\r\nTo down the demons of syntax and epithet is not enough. To compose\r\nblameless sonatas and produce symphonies in the accepted style, is not\r\nadding an iota to the world's worth.\r\n\r\nThe individual who tries to compose either ideas or harmonious sounds,\r\nand hopes for success, must compose because he can not help it. He must\r\nplace the thing in a way it has never before been placed; on the subject\r\nhe must throw a new light; he must carry the standard forward, and plant\r\nit one degree nearer the uncaptured citadel of the Ideal. And he must\r\nremember this: the very prominence of his position will cause him to be\r\nthe target of contumely, abuse and much stupid misunderstanding. If he\r\ncomplains of these things (as he probably will), he reveals a rift in\r\nthe lute and proves that he is only a half-god, after all.\r\n\r\nMen of the highest type of culture--those of masterly talent--are not\r\ngregarious in their nature. The \"jiner\" instinct goes with a man who is\r\na little doubtful, and so he attaches himself to this society, club or\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nThe very tendency to \"jine\" is an admission of weakness--it is a getting\r\nunder cover, a combining against the supposed enemy. The \"jiner\" is an\r\nameba that clings to flotsam, instead of floating free in the great\r\nocean of life. The lion loves his mate, but prefers to flock by himself.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer in art, as in any other field, must be willing to face\r\ndeprivations and loneliness and heart-hunger. He must find companionship\r\nwith birds and animals, and be brother to the trees and swift-flying\r\nclouds. When men meet on the desert or in the forest wilds, how grateful\r\nand how gracious is their hand-clasp! When love and understanding come\r\nto those who live on the border-land of two worlds, how precious and\r\npriceless the boon!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRobert Schumann was the son of a book-publisher of Zwickau. He was a\r\nhandsome lad with the flash of genius in his luminous eyes, and an\r\nindependence like that of an Alpine goat. When very young they say he\r\nused to have tantrums. If your child has a tantrum, it is bad policy for\r\nyou to imitate him and have one, too.\r\n\r\nA tantrum is only one of the little whirlwinds of God--it is misdirected\r\nenergy, power not yet controlled. When Robert had a tantrum, his father\r\nwould shake him violently to improve his temper, or fall upon him with a\r\nstrap that hung handy behind the kitchen-door. Then the mother, when the\r\nfather was out of the way, would take the lad and cry over him, and\r\ncoddle him, and undo the discipline.\r\n\r\nThe best treatment for tantrums is--nothing. The more you let a nervous,\r\nimpressionable child alone, the better.\r\n\r\nWhen the lad was fourteen years old, we find him setting type in his\r\nfather's printery. He was working on a book called, \"The World's\r\nCelebrities,\" and his share of the work dealt with Jean Paul Richter. He\r\ngrew interested in the copy and stopped setting type and read ahead, as\r\nprinters sometimes will. The more he read, the more he was fascinated.\r\nHe fell under the spell of Jean Paul the Only.\r\n\r\nJean Paul, inspired by Jean Jacques, was the inspirer of the whole brood\r\nof young writers of his time. To him they looked as to a Deliverer.\r\nJean Paul the Only! The largest, gentlest, most generous heart in all\r\nliterature! The peculiar mark of Richter's style is analogy and\r\ncomparison; everything he saw reminded him of something else, and then\r\nhe tells you of things of which both remind him. He leads and lures you\r\non, and takes you far from home, but always brings you safely back. Yet\r\ncomparison proves us false when we deal with Richter himself. He stands\r\nalone, like Adam's recollection of his fall, which according to Jean\r\nPaul was the one sweet, unforgetable thing in all the life of the First\r\nCitizen of his time.\r\n\r\nJean Paul seems to have combined in that mighty brain all feminine as\r\nwell as masculine attributes. The soul in which the feminine does not\r\nmingle is ripe for wrong, strife and unreason. \"It was mother-love,\r\ncarried one step further, that enabled the Savior to embrace a world,\"\r\nsays Carlyle.\r\n\r\nThe sweep of tender emotion that murmurs and rustles through the writing\r\nof Jean Paul is like the echo of a lullaby heard in a dream. Perhaps it\r\ncame from that long partnership when mother and son held the siege\r\nagainst poverty, and the kitchen-table served them as a writing-desk,\r\nand the patient old mother was his sole reviewer, critic, reader and\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nFor shams, hypocrisy and pretense Jean Paul had a cyclone of sarcasm,\r\nand the blows he struck were such as only a son of Anak could give; but\r\nin his heart there was no hate. He could despise a man's bad habits and\r\nstill love the man behind the veneer of folly. So his arms seem ever\r\nextended, welcoming the wanderer home.\r\n\r\nDear Jean Paul, big and homely, what an insight you had into the heart\r\nof things, and what a flying-machine your imagination was! Room for many\r\npassengers? Yes, and children especially, for these you loved most of\r\nall, because you were ever only just a big overgrown boy yourself. You\r\ncried your eyes out before your hair grew white, and then a child or a\r\nwoman led you about; and thus did you supply Victor Hugo a saying that\r\ncan not die: \"To be blind and to be loved--what happier fate!\"\r\n\r\nYes, Jean Paul used to cry at his work when he wrote well, and I do,\r\ntoo. I always know when I write particularly well, for at such times I\r\nmop furiously. However, I seldom mop.\r\n\r\nRobert Schumann began to write little essays, and the essays were as\r\nnear like Jean Paul's as he could make them. He read them to his mother,\r\njust as Jean Paul used to write for his mother and call her \"my Gentle\r\nReader\"--he had but one.\r\n\r\nRobert's mother believed in her boy--what mother does not? But her love\r\nwas not tempered by reason, and in it there was a sentimental flavor\r\nakin to the maudlin.\r\n\r\nThe father wanted the lad to take up his own business, as German fathers\r\ndo, but the mother filled the lad's head with the thought that he was\r\nfit for something higher and better. She was not willing to let the\r\nseed ripen in Nature's way--she thought hothouse methods were an\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nSuch a mother's ambition centers in her son. She wants him to do the\r\nthing she has never been able to do. She thirsts for honors, applause,\r\npublicity, and all those things that bring trouble and distress and make\r\nmen old before their time.\r\n\r\nSo we find the boy at eighteen packed off to Heidelberg to study law,\r\nwith no special preparation in knowledge of the world, of men or books.\r\nBut old father antic, the law, was not to his taste. Robert liked music\r\nand poetry better. His fine, sensitive, emotional spirit found its best\r\nexercise in music; and at the house of Professor Carus he used to sing\r\nwith the professor's wife. This Professor Carus, by the way, is, I\r\nbelieve, directly related to our own Doctor Paul Carus, of whom all\r\nthinking people in America have reason to be proud. I am told that when\r\na boy of eighteen or nineteen mingles his voice several evenings a week\r\nwith that of a married lady aged, say, thirty-five, and they also play\r\n\"four hands\" an hour or so a day, that the boy is apt to surprise the\r\nmarried lady by falling very much in love with her. Boys are quite given\r\nto this thing, anyway, of falling in love with women old enough to be\r\ntheir mothers--I don't know why it is. Sometimes I am rather inclined to\r\ncommend the scheme, since it often brings good results. The fact that\r\nthe woman's emotions are well tempered with a sort of maternal regard\r\nfor her charge holds folly in check, dispels that tired feeling,\r\npromotes digestion, and stimulates the action of the ganglionic cells.\r\n\r\nIt was surely so in this instance, for Madame Carus taught the youth how\r\nto compose, and fired his mind to excel as a pianist. He wrote and\r\ndedicated small songs to her, and their relationship added cubits to the\r\nboy's stature.\r\n\r\nFrom a boy he became a man at a bound. Just as one single April day,\r\nwith its showers and sunshine, will transform the seemingly lifeless\r\ntwigs into leafy branches, so did this young man's intellect ripen in\r\nthe sunshine of love.\r\n\r\nAs for Professor Carus, he was too busy with his theorems and biological\r\nexperiments to trouble himself about so trivial a matter as a youngster\r\nfalling in love with his accomplished wife--here the Professor's good\r\nsense was shown.\r\n\r\nJean Paul Richter lighted his torch at the flame of Jean Jacques\r\nRousseau. In a letter to Agnes Carus, Schumann has acknowledged his\r\nobligation to Richter, in a style that is truly Richteresque.\r\n\r\nSays Robert:\r\n\r\n     Dear Lady:--I read from Jean Paul last night until I fell asleep\r\n     and then I dreamed of you. It was at the torch of Jean Paul that I\r\n     lighted my tallow dip, and now he is dead and these eyes shall\r\n     never look into his, nor will his voice fall upon my ears. I cry\r\n     salt tears to think that Jean Paul never knew you. If I could only\r\n     have brought you two together and then looked upon you, realizing,\r\n     as I would, that you had both come from High Olympus! Blissful are\r\n     the days since I knew you, for you have brought within my range of\r\n     vision new constellations, and into my soul has come the clear,\r\n     white light of peace and truth. With you I am purified, freed from\r\n     sin, and harmony fills my tired heart. Without you--why, really I\r\n     have never dared think about it, for fear that reason would topple,\r\n     and my mind forget its 'customed way--let's talk of music. * * *\r\n\r\nProfessor Carus kept his ear close to the ground for a higher call, and\r\nwhen the call came from Leipzig, he moved there with his family.\r\n\r\nIt was not many weeks before Robert was writing home, explaining that\r\nlawyers were men who get good people into trouble, and bad folks out;\r\nand as for himself he had decided to cut the business and fling himself\r\ninto the arms of the Muse.\r\n\r\nThis letter brought his mother down upon him with tears and pleadings\r\nthat he would not fail to redeem the Schumanns by becoming a Great Man.\r\nPoetry was foolishness and all musicians were poor--there were a hundred\r\nof them in Zwickau who lived on rye-bread and wienerwurst.\r\n\r\nThe boy promised and the mother went home pacified. But not many weeks\r\nhad passed before Robert set out on a pilgrimage to Bayreuth, to visit\r\nthe scene of Jean Paul's romances. On this same tour he went to Munich,\r\nand there met Heinrich Heine, who was from that day to enter into his\r\nheart and jostle Jean Paul for first place. He was accompanied on this\r\nmemorable trip by Gisbert Rosen, who proved his lifelong friend and\r\nconfidant. Very naturally Leipzig was the ardently desired goal of his\r\nwanderings. At once on arriving there, he sought out the home of\r\nProfessor and Madame Carus. That his greeting (and mayhap hers) did not\r\ncontain all the warmth the boy lover had anticipated is shown in a\r\nletter to Rosen, wherein he says: \"This world is only a huge graveyard\r\nof buried dreams, a garden of cypress and weeping willows, a silent\r\npeep-show with tearful puppets. Alas for our high faith--I wonder if\r\nJean Paul wasn't right when he said that love lessens woman's delicacy,\r\nand time and distance dissipate it like morning dew?\"\r\n\r\nYet Madame Carus was kind, for Robert played at little informal concerts\r\nat her house, and she urged him to abandon law for music; and he refers\r\nthe matter to Rosen, asking Rosen's advice and explaining how he wants\r\nto be advised, just as we usually do. Rosen tells him that no man can\r\nsucceed at an undertaking unless his heart is in the work, and so he\r\nshifts the responsibility of deciding on Professor Carus, whom Robert\r\n\"respects,\" but does not exactly admire enough to follow his advice.\r\n\r\nRobert does not consider the Professor a practical man, and so leaves\r\nthe matter to his wife. In the meantime songs are written similar to\r\nHeine's, and essays turned off, pinned with the precise synonym, the\r\nphrase exquisite, just like Jean Paul's. Progress in piano-playing goes\r\nsteadily forward, with practise on the violin, all under the tutelage of\r\nMadame Carus, who one fine day takes the young man to play for Frederick\r\nWieck, the best music-teacher in Leipzig.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Musicians?\" said Wieck, \"I raise them!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so he did. He proved the value of his theories by making great\r\nperformers of Maria and Clara, his daughters--two sisters more gifted in\r\na musical way have never been born. Germany excels in philosophy and\r\nmusic--a seeming paradox. Music is supposed to be a compound of the\r\nstuff that dreams are made of--hazy, misty, dim, intangible feelings set\r\nto sounds--we close our eyes and they take us captive and carry us away\r\non the wings of melody. And so it may be true that music is born of\r\nmoonshine, and fragrant memories, and hopes too great for earth, and\r\nloves unrealized; yet its expression is the most exacting of sciences. A\r\nGreat Musician has not only to be a poet and a dreamer, but he must also\r\nbe a mathematician, cold as chilled steel, and a philosopher who can\r\nfollow a reason to its lair and grapple it to the death. And that is why\r\nGreat Musicians are so rare, and that is also why, perhaps, there are no\r\ngreat women composers. \"Women of genius are men,\" said the De Goncourts.\r\nA Great Musician is a paradox, a miracle, a multiple-sided man--stern,\r\nfirm, selfish, proud and unyielding; yet sensuous as the ether, tender\r\nas a woman, innocent as a child, and as plastic as potters' clay. And\r\nwith most of them, let us frankly admit it, the hand of the Potter\r\nshook. When people write about musicians, they seldom write moderately.\r\nThe man is either a selfish rogue or an angel of light--it all depends\r\nupon your point of view. And the curious part is, both sides are right.\r\n\r\nWieck was very fond of his daughters, and like good housewives who are\r\nproud of their biscuit, he apologized for them. \"He never quite forgave\r\nour mother because we were girls,\" said Clara once, to Kalkbrenner.\r\nWieck, the good man, was a philosopher, and he had a notion that the\r\nblood of woman is thinner than that of man--that it contains more white\r\nserum and fewer red corpuscles, and that Nature has designed the body of\r\na woman to nourish her offspring, but that man's energy goes to feed his\r\nbrain. Yet his girls were so much beyond average mortals that they would\r\nset men a pace in spite of the handicap.\r\n\r\nFortunate it is for me that I do not have to act as the court of last\r\nappeal on this genius business. The man who decides against woman will\r\nforfeit his popularity, have his reputation ripped into carpet-rags, and\r\nhis good name worked up into crazy-quilts by a thousand Woman's Clubs.\r\n\r\nBut certain it is that women are the inspirers of music. As critics they\r\nare more judicial and more appreciative. Without women there would be no\r\nSymphony Concerts, any more than there would be churches.\r\n\r\nWomen take men to the Grand Opera and to Musical Festivals--and I am\r\nglad.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nClara Wieck was only ten years old, with dresses that came to her knees,\r\nwhen Robert Schumann first began to take lessons of her father. She was\r\ntall for her age, and had a habit of brushing her hair from her eyes as\r\nshe played, that impressed the young man as very funny. She could not\r\nremember a time when she did not play: and she showed such ease and\r\nabandon that her father used to call her in and have her illustrate his\r\nideas on the keyboard.\r\n\r\nRobert didn't like the child--she was needlessly talented. She could do,\r\njust as a matter of course, the things that he could scarcely accomplish\r\nwith great effort. He didn't like her.\r\n\r\nAlready Clara had played in various concerts, and was a great favorite\r\nwith the local public. Soon her father planned little tours, when he\r\ngave performances assisted by his two daughters, who could play both\r\nviolin and piano. Their fame grew and fortune smiled. Wieck took a\r\nlarger house and raised his prices for pupils.\r\n\r\nRobert Schumann wandered over to Zwickau to visit his folks, then went\r\non down the Rhine to Heidelberg to see Rosen. It was nearly a year\r\nbefore he got back to Leipzig, resolved to continue his music studies.\r\nWieck had a front room vacant, and so the young man took lodgings with\r\nhis teacher.\r\n\r\nIt was not so very long before Clara was wearing her dresses a little\r\nlonger. She now dressed her hair in two braids instead of one, and\r\nthese braids were tied with ribbons instead of a shoe-string. More\r\nconcerts were being arranged, and the attendance was larger--people were\r\nsaying that Clara Wieck was an Infant Phenomenon.\r\n\r\nRobert was progressing, but not so rapidly as he wished. To aid matters\r\na bit, he invented a brace and extension to his middle finger. It gave\r\nhim a farther reach and a stronger stroke, he thought. In secret he\r\npractised for hours with this \"corset\" on his finger; he didn't know\r\nthat a corset means weakness, not strength. After three straight hours\r\nof practise one day, he took the machine from his hand and was\r\nastonished to see the finger curl up like a pretzel. He hurried to a\r\nphysician and was told that the member was paralyzed. Various forms of\r\ntreatment were tried, but the tendons were injured, and at last the\r\ndoctors told him his brain could never again telegraph to that hand so\r\nit would perfectly obey orders. He begged that they would cut the finger\r\noff, but this they refused to do, claiming that, even though the finger\r\nwas in the way, piano-playing in any event was not the chief end of\r\nman--he might try a pick and shovel.\r\n\r\nClara, who now wore her dress to her shoe-tops, sympathized with the\r\nyoung man in his distress. She said, \"Never mind, I will play for\r\nyou--you write the music and I will play it!\"\r\n\r\nGradually he became resigned to this, and spent much of his time\r\ncomposing music for Heine's songs and his own. Wieck didn't much like\r\nthese songs, and forbade his daughter playing such trashy things--only a\r\nparaphrase of Schubert's work, anyway, goodness me!\r\n\r\nThe girl pouted and rebelled, and erelong Robert Schumann was requested\r\nto take lodgings elsewhere. Moodily he obeyed, but he managed to keep up\r\na secret correspondence with Clara, through the help of her sister.\r\nWhenever Clara played in public, Robert was sure to be there, even\r\nthough the distance were a hundred miles. He had given up playing, and\r\nnow swung between composing and literature, having assumed the\r\neditorship of a musical magazine.\r\n\r\nWhen Clara now played in concert, she wore a train, and her hair was\r\ndone up on the top of her head.\r\n\r\nSchumann's musical magazine was winning its way--the young man had a\r\nliterary style. Mendelssohn commended the magazine, and its editor in\r\nturn commended Mendelssohn. A new star had been discovered on the\r\nhorizon--a Pole, Chopin by name. And whenever Clara Wieck appeared,\r\nthere were extended notices, lavish in praise, profuse in prophecy.\r\n\r\nHerz had written an article for a rival journal about Clara Wieck,\r\nwherein the statement was made that no woman trained on, that her\r\nplaying was intuitive, and the limit quickly reached--marriage was death\r\nto a woman's art, etc.\r\n\r\nTo this Schumann replied with needless heat, and his friends began to\r\njoke him about his \"disinterestedness.\" He was getting moody, and there\r\nwere times when he was silent for days. His passion for Clara Wieck was\r\nconsuming his life. He resolved to go direct to Frederick Wieck and have\r\nit out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey are always called \"the Schumanns\"--Robert and Clara. You can not\r\nseparate them, any more than you can separate the great Robert Browning\r\nand Elizabeth Barrett. \"Whomsoever God hath joined together, let no man\r\nput asunder,\" seems rather a needless injunction, since we know that\r\nman's efforts in the line of separation have ever but one result:\r\nopposition fans the flame.\r\n\r\nJust as Elizabeth Barrett's father forcibly opposed the mating of his\r\ndaughter, so did Frederick Wieck oppose the love of his daughter Clara\r\nfor Robert Schumann.\r\n\r\nAnd one can not blame the man so very much--he knew the young man and he\r\nknew the girl; and deducting fifty per cent for paternal pride, he saw\r\nthat the girl was much the stronger character of the two. Clara had\r\nalready a recognized reputation as a performer; her playing had made her\r\nfather rich, and he was sure that greater things were to come. Beside\r\nthat, she was only seventeen years old--a mere child.\r\n\r\nRobert was twenty-six, with most of his future before him--he was\r\nadvised to win a name and place for himself before aspiring to the hand\r\nof a great artist: and so he was bowed out.\r\n\r\nHe took the matter into the courts, and the decision was that, as she\r\nwas now eighteen years old, she had the right to wed, if she were so\r\nminded.\r\n\r\nAnd so they were married; but Frederick Wieck was not present at the\r\nceremony to give the bride away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSchumann was essentially feminine in many ways, as the best men always\r\nare. In spite of his mental independence, he did his best work when\r\nshielded in the shadow of a stronger personality. Without Clara, Robert\r\nwould probably be unknown to us. She gave him the courage and the\r\nconfidence that he lacked; and she it was who interpreted his work to\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nHeine characterized Meyerbeer's \"Les Huguenots\" as \"like a Gothic\r\ncathedral whose heaven-soaring spire and colossal cupolas seem to have\r\nbeen planted there by the sure hand of a giant; whereas the innumerable\r\nfeatures, the rosettes and arabesques that are spread over it everywhere\r\nlike a lacework of stone, witness to the indefatigable patience of a\r\ndwarf.\"\r\n\r\nVery different is the work of Robert Schumann, who, like his master\r\nSchubert, knew little of the architectonics of the Art Divine. But\r\nSchubert seems to have been the first to give us the \"lyric cry\"--the\r\nprayer of a heart bowed down, or the ecstasy of a soul enrapt.\r\n\r\nSchumann built on Schubert. Music was to Schumann the expression of an\r\nemotion. He saw in pictures, then he told in tones, what his inward eye\r\nbeheld. He even went so far as to give the names of persons, their\r\npeculiarities and experiences on the keyboard. It is needless to say\r\nthat the tension of mind in such experiments is apt to reach the\r\nbreaking strain. We are under bonds for the moderate use of every\r\nfaculty, and he who misuses any of God's gifts may not hope to go\r\nunscathed.\r\n\r\nThe exquisite quality of Robert Schumann's imagination served to make\r\nhim shun the society of vulgar people. The inability to grasp things\r\nintuitively harassed him, and he acquired a habit of keeping silence,\r\nexcept with the elect. He lived within himself, unless Clara were by,\r\nand then he leaned on her.\r\n\r\nAnd what a strong, brave and beautiful soul she was! In a sense she\r\nsacrificed her own career for the man she loved. And by giving all, she\r\nwon all.\r\n\r\nMost descriptions of women begin by telling how the individual looked\r\nand what she wore. No pen-portraits of Clara Schumann have come down to\r\nus, for the reason that she was too great, too elusive in spirit, for\r\nany snapshot artist to attempt her. She never looked twice the same. In\r\nfeature she was commonplace, her form lacked the classic touch, and her\r\nraiment was as plain as the plumage of a brown thrush in an autumn\r\nhedgerow. She was as homely as George Eliot, Mary Wollstonecraft, Rosa\r\nBonheur, George Sand, or Madame De Stael. No two of the women named\r\nlooked alike, but I once saw a composite photograph of their portraits\r\nand the picture sent no thrills along my keel. Their splendor was a\r\nmatter of spirit. Have you ever seen the Duse?--there is but one. In\r\nrepose this woman's face is absolute nullity. She starts with a\r\nblank--you would never take a second glance at her at a pink tea. Her\r\ndress is bargain day, her form so-so, her features clay.\r\n\r\nBut mayhap she will lift her hand and resting her chin upon it will look\r\nat you out of half-closed eyes that never are twice alike. If you are\r\nspeaking you will suddenly become aware that she is listening, and then\r\nyou will become uncomfortable and try to stop, but can not; for you will\r\nrealize that you have been talking at random, and you want to redeem\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nThe presence of this plain woman is a challenge--she knows! Yet she\r\nnever contradicts, and when she wills it, she will lead you out of the\r\nmaze and make you at peace with yourself; for our quarrel with the world\r\nis only a quarrel with self. When we are at peace with self we are at\r\npeace with God.\r\n\r\nThe Duse is a surprise, in that her homeliness of face masks an\r\nintellect that is a revelation. Her body is an exasperation to the tribe\r\nof Worth, but it houses a soul that has lived every life, died every\r\ndeath, known every sorrow, tasted every joy, and been one with the\r\noutcast, the despised, the forsaken; and has stood, too, clothed in\r\nshining raiment by the side of the great, the noble, the powerful.\r\nKnowing all, she forgives all. And across the face and out of the eyes,\r\nand even from her silence, come messages of sympathy--messages of\r\nstrength, messages of a faith that is dauntless. Great people are simply\r\nthose who have sympathy plus. Clara Schumann knew the excellence of her\r\nchosen mate, and through her sympathy made it possible for him to\r\nexpress himself at his highest and best. She also guessed his\r\nlimitations and sought to hold him 'gainst the calamity she saw looming\r\non the horizon, no bigger than a man's hand.\r\n\r\nWhen he was moody and there came times of melancholy, she invited young\r\npeople to the house; and so Robert mingled his life with theirs, and in\r\ntheir aspirations he shook off the demons of doubt.\r\n\r\nIt was in this way that he became interested in various rising stars,\r\nand although in some instances we are aware that his prophecies went\r\nastray, we know that he hailed Chopin and Brahms long before they had\r\ncome within the ken of the musical world, that so often looks through\r\nthe large end of the telescope. And this kindly encouragement, this\r\nfostering welcome that the Schumanns gave to all aspiring young artists,\r\nis not the least of their virtues. We love them because they were kind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nClara Schumann was wise beyond the lot of woman. She knew this fact\r\nwhich very few mortals ever realize: The triumphs of yesterday belong to\r\nyesterday, with all of yesterday's defeats and sorrows--the day is Here,\r\nthe time is Now. She did not drag her troubles behind her with a rope,\r\nnor wax vain over achievements done. When the light of her husband's\r\nintellect went out in darkness and he lived for a space a lingering\r\ndeath, she faced the dawn each morning, resolved to do her work and do\r\nit the best she could.\r\n\r\nWhen death came to Robert's relief, her one ambition, like that of Mary\r\nShelley, was to write her husband's name indelibly on history's page.\r\n\r\nThe professedly and professionally cheerful person is very depressing.\r\nThe pessimist always has wit, for wit reveals itself in the knowledge of\r\nvalues. And the individual who accepts what Fate sends, and undoes\r\nCalamity by drinking all of it, is sure to have a place in our calendar\r\nof saints.\r\n\r\nClara Schumann, a widow at thirty-seven, with a goodly brood of babies,\r\nand no income to speak of, lived one day at a time, did her work as well\r\nas she could, and always had a little time and energy over to use for\r\nothers less fortunate.\r\n\r\nSuch fortitude is sure to bear fruit, and friends flocked to her as\r\nnever before. The way to secure friends is to be one.\r\n\r\nMadame Schumann made concert tours throughout the Continent and England,\r\nmeeting on absolute equality the music-loving people, as well as the\r\nKings of Art. She played her husband's pieces with such a wealth of\r\nexpression that folks wondered why they had never heard of them. And so\r\ntoday, wherever hearts are sad, or glad, and songs are sung, and strings\r\nvibrate, and keys respond to love's caress, there is in hearts that know\r\nand feel, a shrine; and on this shrine in letters of gold two words are\r\ncarved, and they are these: THE SCHUMANNS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEBASTIAN BACH]\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN BACH\r\n\r\n     The name of Bach would have been famous in musical history without\r\n     Johann Sebastian, but with his name added it becomes the most\r\n     illustrious that the world has ever known. Bach had many pupils,\r\n     but none surpassed his own sons, six of whom became great\r\n     musicians, but with these the musical faculty died.\r\n\r\n     --_Sir Hubert Parry_\r\n\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN BACH\r\n\r\nThe art of today is imitative. Once men had convictions, but we have\r\nonly opinions, and these are usually borrowed. The artificiality of\r\nlife, and the rush and the worry afford no time for great desires to\r\npossess our souls.\r\n\r\nWe average well, but no Colossus looms large above the crowd and goes\r\nhis solitary way unmindful of the throng: we look alike, act alike,\r\nthink alike, and in order that the likeness may be complete, we dress\r\nalike.\r\n\r\nTo wear a hat of your own selection or voice thoughts of your own\r\nthinking is to invite unseemly mirth, and finally scorn and contumely.\r\n\r\nThe great creators were solitary, rural in their instincts, ignorant and\r\nheedless of what the world was saying and doing. They were men of deep\r\nconvictions and enthusiasms, unmindful of laughter or ridicule, caring\r\nlittle even for approbation.\r\n\r\nNo \"boom town\" can possibly produce a genius: it only fosters sundry\r\nsmall Napoleons of finance. America is a nation of boomers--financial,\r\npolitical, social and theological.\r\n\r\nWe have sarcasm and cynicism, and we possess much that is clever, all\r\nproduced by snatches of success, well mixed with disappointment and the\r\nbitterness which much contact with the world is sure to evolve. Our age\r\nthat goes everywhere, knows everybody's business, and religiously reads\r\nonly \"the last edition,\" produces a Bill Nye, a Sam Jones, a Teddy\r\nRoosevelt, a DeWitt Talmage, a Hopkinson Smith, a Sam Walter Foss, a\r\nVictor Herbert; but it is not at all likely to produce a Praxiteles, a\r\nMichelangelo, a Rembrandt, an Immanuel Kant or a Johann Sebastian Bach.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat Shakespeare is to literature, Michelangelo to sculpture, and\r\nRembrandt to portrait-painting, Johann Sebastian Bach is to organ-music.\r\nHe was the greatest organist of his time, and his equal has not yet been\r\nproduced, though nearly three hundred years have passed since his death.\r\n\"The organ reached perfection at the hands of Bach,\" says Haweis. As a\r\ncomposer for the organ, Bach stands secure--his position is at the head,\r\nand is absolutely unassailable.\r\n\r\nIn point of temperament and disposition Bach bears a closer resemblance\r\nto Michelangelo than to either of the others whose names I have\r\nmentioned. He was stern, strong, self-contained, and so deeply religious\r\nthat he was not only a Christian but a good deal of a pagan as well. A\r\nhomely man was Bach--quiet, simple in tastes and blunt in speech.\r\n\r\nThe earnest way in which this plain, unpretentious man focused upon his\r\nlife-work and raised organ-music to the highest point of art must\r\ncommand the sincere admiration of every lover of honest endeavor.\r\n\r\nBach was so great that he had no artistic jealousy, no whim, and when\r\nharshly and unjustly criticized he did not concern himself enough with\r\nthe quibblers to reply. He made neither apologies nor explanations. The\r\nman who thus allows his life to justify itself, and lets his work speak,\r\nand who, when reviled, reviles not again, must be a very great and lofty\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nBach was a villager and a rustic, and, like Jean Francois Millet, used\r\nto hoe in his garden, trim the vines, play with his children, putting\r\nthem to bed at night, or in the day cease from his work to cut slices of\r\nbrown bread which he spread with honey for the heedless little\r\nimportuner, who had interrupted him in the making of a chorale that was\r\nto charm the centuries. At times he would leave his composing to help\r\nhis wife with her household duties--to wash dishes, sweep the room or\r\ncare for a peevish, fretful child. After the evening prayer, like\r\nMillet, again, when his household were all abed, he would often walk out\r\ninto the night alone, and traverse his solitary way along a wintry road,\r\nthrough the woods or by the winding river, a dim, misty, shadowy figure,\r\nspectral as the \"Sower,\" lonely as the \"Fagot-Gatherer,\" talking to\r\nhimself, mayhap, and communing with his Maker.\r\n\r\nIn his later years, when he traveled from one village or city to another\r\nto attend musical gatherings, he was always accompanied by one or more\r\nof his sons. His ambition was centered on his children, and his hope was\r\nin them. Yet nothing has been added to either organ-building,\r\norgan-playing or composition for the organ since his time.\r\n\r\nHe never knew, any more than Shakespeare knew, that he had set a pace\r\nthat would never be equaled. He would have stood aghast with incredulity\r\nhad he been told that centuries would come and go and his name be\r\nacclaimed as Master.\r\n\r\nSuch was Sebastian Bach--simple, polite, modest, unaffected, generous,\r\nalmost shy--doing his work and doing it as well as he could, living one\r\nday at a time, loving his friends, forgetting his enemies. His heart was\r\nfilled with such melodies that their echo is a blessing and a\r\nbenediction to us yet. Art lives!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHeredity is that law of our being which provides that a man shall\r\nresemble his grandfather--or not. The Bach family has supplied the\r\nbelievers in heredity more good raw material in way of argument than any\r\ndozen other families known to history, combined.\r\n\r\nThe Herschels with three eminent astronomers to their credit, or the\r\nBeechers with half a dozen great preachers, are scarcely worth\r\nmentioning when we remember the Bachs, who for two hundred fifty years\r\nsounded the \"A\" for nearly all Germany.\r\n\r\nThe earliest known member of this musical family was Vert Bach, who was\r\nborn about Fifteen Hundred Fifty. He was a miller and baker by trade,\r\nbut devoted so much time to playing at dances, rehearsing at church\r\nfestivals, and attending gipsy musical performances, that in his milling\r\nbusiness he never prospered and nobody called him \"Pillsbury.\"\r\n\r\nThis man had a son by the name of Hans, a weaver and a right merry\r\nwight, who traveled over the country attending weddings, christenings\r\nand such like festivals, playing upon a fiddle of his own construction.\r\nSo famous was Hans Bach that his name lives in legend and folklore,\r\nwherein it is related that often betimes when he arrived at a village,\r\nthe word would be passed and the whole population would quit work and\r\ncaper on the green. So luring was his fiddle, and so potent his voice in\r\nsong and story, that in a few instances preachers with long faces\r\nwarned their flocks against him; and once we find a country Dogberry had\r\nhis minions lay the innocent Hans by the heels and give him a taste of\r\nthe stocks, simply because he seduced a party of haymakers into\r\nfollowing him off to a dance at a tavern, and in the meantime a storm\r\ncoming up, the hay got wet. Poor Hans protested that he had nothing to\r\ndo with the storm, but his excuses were construed as proof of guilt and\r\nwent for naught.\r\n\r\nAt last in his wanderings, Hans found a buxom lass who was willing to\r\ntake him for better or worse.\r\n\r\nAnd they were married and lived happily ever after, or fairly so.\r\n\r\nThis marriage quite sobered the fun-loving fiddler, so that he settled\r\ndown and worked at his weaving; and at odd hours made himself a bass\r\nviol that looked to be father of all the fiddles. In Eisenach I was told\r\nthat this viol was ten feet high. Hans used to play this instrument at\r\nthe village church, and his playing drew such crowds that the preacher\r\nhad just cause for jealousy, and improved the opportunity, yet stifling\r\nhis rage he ordered the verger to lock the doors and allow no one to\r\ndepart until after the sermon and collection.\r\n\r\nA goodly family was born to Hans and his worthy wife, and all were\r\ntrained in music, so that an orchestra was formed, made up of the\r\nfather, mother, and boys and girls. All the instruments used were made\r\nby Hans, and these included marvelous fiddles, some with one string and\r\nothers with twenty; wooden wind-instruments like flutes, and drums to\r\nmatch the players, some of whom were wee toddlers. It is said that the\r\nmusic this orchestra made was more or less unique.\r\n\r\nThe best part of all this musical exploitation of Hans was that one of\r\nhis boys, Heinrich by name, applied himself so diligently to the art\r\nthat he became the organist in the village church, and then he was\r\ncalled to play the great organ at Arnstadt. Heinrich was not a roisterer\r\nlike his father: he was a man of education and dignity. He composed many\r\npieces, and trained his choruses so well that his fame went abroad as\r\nthe chief musician of all Thuringia. He held his position at Arnstadt\r\nfor fifty years, and died in Sixteen Hundred Ninety-two, at which time\r\nJohann Sebastian Bach, his nephew, was seven years old.\r\n\r\nIn his day Heinrich Bach was known as the \"Great Bach,\" and he had two\r\nsons who were nearly as famous as himself, and would have been quite so,\r\nwere it not for the fact that they had a cousin by the name of Johann\r\nSebastian.\r\n\r\nJohann Sebastian was a son of Johann Ambrosius, a brother of Heinrich,\r\nand Johann Ambrosius, of course, a son of the merry Hans. Johann\r\nAmbrosius was a musician, too, but did not distinguish himself\r\nespecially in this line. His distinction lies in the fact that he was\r\nthe father of Johann Sebastian, and this is quite enough for any one\r\nman, even if Gail Hamilton did once protest that the office of male\r\nparent was insignificant and devoid of honor.\r\n\r\nJohann Ambrosius was a shiftless kind of fellow who drank much beer out\r\nof an earthen pot, and whittled out fiddles, sitting on a bench in the\r\nsun. He sort of let his family shift for themselves. Heinrich Bach, his\r\nbrother, used to speak of him as one of his \"poor relations,\" but at the\r\nannual Bach family festival, when a full hundred Bachs gathered to sing\r\nand play, Johann Ambrosius would attend and play on a flute or fiddle\r\nand prove that he was worthy of the name.\r\n\r\nOn one such annual reunion he took his little boy, Johann Sebastian,\r\neight years old. The boy's mother had died a year or so before, and\r\nafter the mother's death the father seemed to think more of his children\r\nthan ever before--which is often the case, I'm told.\r\n\r\nThey walked the distance, about forty miles, in two days, to where the\r\nfestival occurred. It was one of the white milestones in the boy's\r\nlife--that trip with its revelation of sleeping in barns, singing, and\r\nplaying on many instruments, dining by the wayside, all winding up with\r\na solemn service at a great stone church, where the preacher gave them\r\nhis benediction, and the great company separated with handshakings,\r\nembracings and tears, to meet again in a year. Johann Ambrosius did not\r\nattend the next reunion. Before the Spring had come and birds sang\r\nblithely, a band composed of twenty-five played funeral-dirges at his\r\ngrave--and little Johann Sebastian was an orphan.\r\n\r\nJohann Sebastian's elder brother, Christoph, who had married a few years\r\nbefore and moved away, attended the funeral, and when he went back home\r\nhe took little Johann Sebastian with him--there was no other place to\r\ngo. The lad was allowed to take one thing with him as a remembrance of\r\nthe home that he was now leaving forever--his father's violin in a green\r\nbag, with a leathern drawstring. On the bag were his father's initials,\r\nwoven into the cloth by the boy's mother--a present from sweetheart to\r\nlover before their marriage.\r\n\r\nChristoph was a musician, too, and a prosperous fellow--quite the\r\nantithesis of his father. It takes a lot of love to bring up a child,\r\nand the miracle of mother-love is a constant wonder to every thinking\r\nperson. Without mother-love how would the cross-grained, perverse little\r\ntyrant ever survive the buffets which the world is sure to give? It is\r\nlove that makes existence possible.\r\n\r\nChristoph wished to be kind to his little brother, but it was a kindness\r\nof the head and not of the heart. Only an hour a day was allowed the boy\r\nfor playing on the violin he had brought in the green bag, because\r\nChristoph and his wife \"did not want to hear the noise.\" Then when the\r\nboy stole off to the forest and played there, he was waylaid on the way\r\nhome and well cuffed for disobeying orders. All this seems very much\r\nlike the Goneril and Cordelia business, or the history of Cinderella,\r\nbut as Johann Sebastian told it himself in the after-years, we have\r\nreason to believe it was not fiction.\r\n\r\nLittle Johann Sebastian had been his father's favorite, and this fact\r\nperhaps made Christoph fear the boy was going to tread in his father's\r\nlazy footsteps. So he set about to discipline the lad.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that Johann Ambrosius Bach, who whittled out fiddles\r\nin the sun, and who drank much beer out of an earthen pot, was\r\nshiftless, but it further seems that he was tender-hearted and kind and\r\ntook much interest in teaching Sebastian to play the violin, even while\r\nthe child wore dresses. And sometimes I think it is really better, if\r\nyou have to choose, to drink beer out of an earthen pot and be kind and\r\ngentle, than to have a sharp nose for other folks' faults and be\r\ncontinually trying to pinch and prod the old world into the straight and\r\nnarrow path of virtue. Yet there is wisdom in all folly, and I can see\r\nthat the prohibition concerning little Sebastian's playing the violin\r\nonly an hour a day--mind you! was not without its benefits. Surely it\r\nwould often be a wise bit of diplomacy on the part of the teacher to\r\norder the pupil not to study his arithmetic lesson but an hour a day, on\r\npenalty. Of course it might happen occasionally that the pupil in an\r\nearnest desire to please, might not study at all, yet there are\r\nexceptions to all rules, and we must remember that when Tom Sawyer\r\nforbade the boys using his whitewash-brush, the scheme worked well.\r\n\r\nOne instance, however, might be cited where the law of compensation\r\nseems really to have stood no chance. Christoph had a goodly musical\r\nlibrary and a collection of the best organ-music that had been produced\r\nup to that time. He kept this music in a case, and carried the key to\r\nthe case in his pocket. On rare occasions he had shown bits of this\r\nmusic to Sebastian, who read music like print when it is easy. The boy\r\ndevoured all the music he could lay his hands on, and hummed it over to\r\nhimself until every note and accent was fixed in his memory. He dearly\r\nwanted to examine that music in the locked-up case, but his brother\r\ndeclared his ambition nonsense--he was too young. But the boy contrived\r\na way to pick the lock--for a music-lover laughs at locksmiths--and at\r\nnight when all the household were safely in bed, he would steal\r\ndownstairs in his bare feet and get a sheet of the music and copy it off\r\nby moonlight, sitting in the deep ledge of the window. Thus did he work\r\nfor six months, whenever the moon shone bright enough to read the lines\r\nand signs and marks. But alas! one day the elder brother was rummaging\r\naround the boy's room in search of things contraband and he pounced upon\r\nthe portfolio of copied music. He summoned the offender into his\r\npresence. The facts were admitted, and Johann Sebastian had his bare\r\nlegs well tingled with an apple-sprout. Then the portfolio was\r\nconfiscated and carried away, despite pleadings, promises and tears. And\r\nthe question still remains whether \"discipline\" is not a matter of\r\ngratification to the person in power rather than a sincere and honest\r\nattempt to benefit the person disciplined.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Johann Sebastian Bach was working out his own education:\r\nhe belonged to the boys' chorus at Ohrdruf, as all boys in the vicinity\r\ndid. Music in every German village was an important item, and the best\r\nsingers and best behaved members of the village choir were set apart as\r\na sort of select choir--a choir within a choir--and were often gathered\r\ntogether to sing on special occasions at weddings and festivals. Johann\r\nSebastian had a sweet, well-modulated voice, and whenever he was to\r\nsing, he carried his violin in the green bag, so he could play, too, if\r\nneeded. Thus he played and sang at serenades, just as did Martin Luther,\r\nmany years before, in Johann Sebastian's own native town of Eisenach.\r\n\r\nJohann Sebastian's fame grew until it reached to Luneburg, twelve miles\r\naway, and he was invited there to sing in the choir of Saint Michael's.\r\nThe pay he received was very slight, but that was not to be considered.\r\nAn occasional bowl of soup and piece of rye-bread, and the privilege of\r\nsleeping in the organ-loft, all combined with freedom, made his paradise\r\ncomplete. He played on the harpsichord in the pastor's study sometimes;\r\nand occasionally the organist, who could not help loving such a\r\nmusic-loving boy, would allow him to try the big organ, and at every\r\nservice he was present to play his violin, or if any of the other\r\nplayers were absent he would just fill in and play any instrument\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nThen we hear of him trudging off to Hamburg, a hundred miles away, with\r\nonly a few coppers in his pocket, to hear the great organist Reinke. He\r\nslept in cattle-sheds by the way, played his violin at taverns for\r\nsomething to eat, or plainly stated his case to sympathetic cooks at\r\nbackdoors. One instance he has recorded when all the world seemed to\r\nfrown. He had trudged all day, with nothing to eat, and at evening had\r\nsat down near the open window of an inn, from which came savory smells\r\nof supper. As he sat there, suddenly there were thrown out a couple of\r\nsmall dried herrings. The hungry boy eagerly seized upon them, just as a\r\ndog would. But what was his surprise to find, as he gnawed, in the mouth\r\nof each fish a piece of silver! Some one had read the story of Saint\r\nPeter to a purpose. Young Bach looked in vain for a person to thank, but\r\nperceiving no one he took it as the act of God and an omen that his\r\npilgrimage to hear the great organist should not be in vain.\r\n\r\nThe wonders of Reinke's playing and the marvel of the mighty music\r\nfilled his soul with awe, and fired his ambition to do a like\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nDid the great Reinke know as he played that bright Sabbath morning,\r\nfilling the cathedral with thunders of echoing bass, or sounds of sweet,\r\nsubtle melody--did he know that away back in the throng stood a dusty,\r\ntawny-haired boy who had tramped a hundred miles just for this event?\r\nAnd did the organist guess as he played that he was inspiring a human\r\nsoul to do a grand and wondrous work, and live a life whose influence\r\nshould be deathless? Probably not--few men indeed know when virtue has\r\ngone out of them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Reinke was playing just to suit himself, and had purposely put\r\nthe unappreciative, lazy, sleepy occupants of the pews out of his\r\nthought, all unmindful that there was one among a thousand, back behind\r\na pillar, dusty and worn, but now unconsciously refreshed and oblivious\r\nto all save the playing of the great organ. There stood the boy bathed\r\nin sweet sounds, with streaming eyes and responsive heart.\r\n\r\nHis inward emotions supplemented the outward melody, for music demands a\r\nlistener, and at the last is a matter of soul, not sound: its appeal\r\nbeing a harmony that dwells within. So played Reinke, and back by the\r\ndoor, peering from behind a pillar, stood the boy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSebastian Bach was such a useful member of the choir at Luneburg that\r\nthe town musician from Weimar, who happened to be going that way,\r\ninduced him to go home with him as assistant organist.\r\n\r\nThis was a definite move in the direction of fame and fortune. Men who\r\ncan make themselves useful are needed--there is ever a search for such.\r\nThey wanted Bach at Weimar. Johann Sebastian Bach, aged eighteen, was\r\nwanted because he did his work well.\r\n\r\nAfter three or four months at Weimar he made a visit to Arnstadt, where\r\nhis uncle had so long been organist. His name at Arnstadt was a name to\r\nconjure with, and in fact throughout all that part of the country,\r\nwhenever a man proved to be a musician of worth and power the people out\r\nof compliment called him a \"Bach.\"\r\n\r\nJohann Sebastian was invited to play for the people, and all were so\r\ndelighted that they insisted he should come and fill the place made\r\nvacant by the death of the \"Great Bach.\"\r\n\r\nSo he came and was duly installed.\r\n\r\nAnd the young man drilled his chorus, wrote cantatas, and arranged\r\nchants and hymns. But he was far from contented. He was being pushed on\r\nby a noble unrest. It was not so very long before we find him packing\r\noff to Denmark, with little ceremony, to listen to the playing of\r\nBuxtehude, the greatest player of his age.\r\n\r\nBach had been quite content to tiptoe into the church when Reinke\r\nplayed, grateful for the privilege of listening, half-expecting to be\r\nthrust out as an interloper. He had gained confidence since then, and\r\nnow introduced himself to Buxtehude and was greeted by the octogenarian\r\nas a brother and an equal, although sixty years divided them. His visit\r\nextended itself from one week to two, and then to a month or more, and a\r\nmessage came from his employers that if he expected to hold his place he\r\nhad better return.\r\n\r\nBach's visit to Buxtehude formed another white milestone in his career.\r\nHe came back filled with enthusiasm and overflowing with ideas and plans\r\nthat a single lifetime could not materialize. Those who have analyzed\r\nthe work of Buxtehude and Bach tell us that there is a richness of\r\ncounterpoint, a vigor of style, a fulness of harmony, and a strong,\r\nglowing, daring quality that in some pieces is identical with both\r\ncomposers. In other words, Bach admired Buxtehude so much that for a\r\ntime he wrote and played just like him, very much as Turner began by\r\npainting as near like Claude Lorraine as he possibly could. Genius has\r\nits prototype, and in all art there is to be found this apostolic\r\nsuccession. Bach first built on Reinke; next he transferred his\r\nallegiance to Buxtehude; from this he gradually developed courage and\r\nself-reliance until he fearlessly trusted himself in deep water,\r\nheedless of danger. And it is this fearless, self-reliant and\r\nself-sufficient quality that marks the work of every exceptional man in\r\nevery line of art. \"Here's to the man who dares,\" said Disraeli. All\r\nstrong men begin by worshiping at a shrine, and if they continue to grow\r\nthey shift their allegiance until they know only one altar and that is\r\nthe Ideal which dwells in their own heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now behold how Heinrich Bach had educated his people into the belief\r\nthat there was only one way to play, and that was as he did it. It is\r\nnot at all probable that Heinrich put forward any claims of perfection,\r\nbut the people regarded his playing as high-water mark, and any\r\nvariation from his standards was considered fantastic and absurd.\r\n\r\nIn all of the old German Protestant churches are records kept giving the\r\nexact history of the church. You can tell for two hundred years back\r\njust when an organist was hired or dismissed; when a preacher came and\r\nwhen he went away, with minute mention as to reasons.\r\n\r\nAnd so we find in the records of the Church at Arnstadt that the\r\norganist, Johann Sebastian Bach, took a vacation without leave in the\r\nyear Seventeen Hundred Five, and further, when he returned his playing\r\nwas \"fantastical.\"\r\n\r\nWith the young man's compositions the Consistory expressed echoing\r\ngroans of dissatisfaction. A list of charges was drawn up against him,\r\none of which runs as follows: \"We charge him with a habit of making\r\nsurprising variations in the chorales, and intermixing divers strange\r\nsounds, so that thereby the congregation was confounded.\"\r\n\r\nBach's answers are filed with the original charges, and are all very\r\nbrief and submissive. In some instances he pleads guilty, not thinking\r\nit worth his while, strong man that he was, to either apologize or\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\nBut the most damning count brought against him was this: \"We further\r\ncharge him with introducing into the choir-loft a Stranger Maiden, who\r\nmade music.\" To this, young Bach makes no reply. Brave boy!\r\n\r\nThe sequel is shown that in a few weeks he was married to this \"Stranger\r\nMaiden,\" who was his cousin. She was a Bach, too, a descendant of the\r\nmerry Hans, and she, also, played the organ. But great was the horror of\r\nthe Arnstadites that a woman should play a church organ. Mein Gott im\r\nHimmel--a woman might be occupying the pulpit next!\r\n\r\nJohann Sebastian's indifference to criticism is partially explained by\r\nthe fact that he was in correspondence with the Consistory at Mulhausen,\r\nand also with the Duke Wilhelm Ernest, of Saxe-Weimar. Both Mulhausen\r\nand Weimar wanted his services. Under such conditions men have ever been\r\nknown to invite a rupture--let us hope that Johann Sebastian Bach was\r\nnot quite so human.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMichelangelo never married, but Bach held the average good by marrying\r\ntwice.\r\n\r\nHe was the father of just twenty children. His first wife was a woman\r\nwith well-defined musical tastes, as was meet in one with such an\r\nillustrious musical pedigree. It wasn't fashion then to educate women,\r\nand one biographer expresses a doubt as to whether Bach's first wife was\r\nable to read and write. To read and write are rather cheap\r\naccomplishments, though. Last year I met several excellent specimens of\r\nmanhood in the Tennessee Mountains who could do neither, yet these men\r\nhad a goodly hold on the eternal verities.\r\n\r\nWe know that Bach's wife had a thorough sympathy with his work, and that\r\nhe used to sing or play his compositions to her, and when the children\r\ngot big enough, they tried the new-made hymn tunes, too. These children\r\nsang before they could talk plain, and the result was that the two elder\r\nsons, Wilhelm Friedemann and Phillip Emmanuel, became musicians of\r\nmarked ability. Half a dozen other sons became musicians also, but the\r\ntwo named above made some valuable additions to the music fund of the\r\nworld. Haydn has paid personal tribute to Emmanuel Bach, acknowledging\r\nhis obligation, and expressing to him the belief that he was a greater\r\nman than his father.\r\n\r\nThe nine years Bach spent at Weimar, under the patronage of the Duke\r\nWilhelm Ernest, were years rich in results. His office was that of\r\nConcert Master, and Leader of the Choir at Ducal Chapel. The duties not\r\nbeing very exacting, he had plenty of time to foster his bent. Freed\r\nfrom all apprehension along the line of the bread-and-butter question he\r\ndevoted himself untiringly to his work. It was here he developed that\r\nstyle of fingering that was to be followed by the players on the\r\nharpsichord, and which further serves as the basis for our present\r\nmanner of piano-playing. Bach was the first man to make use of the thumb\r\nin organ-playing, and I believe it was James Huneker who once said that\r\n\"Bach discovered the human hand.\"\r\n\r\nBach made a complete study of the mechanism of the organ, invented\r\nvarious arrangements for the better use of the pedals, and gave his\r\nideas without stint to the makers, who, it seems, were glad to profit by\r\nthem. Even then Weimar was a place of pilgrimage, although Goethe had\r\nnot yet come to illumine it with his presence. But the traditions of\r\nWeimar have been musical and artistic for four hundred years, and this\r\nhad its weight with Goethe when he decided to make it his home.\r\n\r\nIn Bach's day, pilgrims from afar used to come to attend the musical\r\nfestivals given by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar; and these pilgrims would go\r\nhome and spread the name of Johann Sebastian Bach. Many invitations used\r\nto come for him to go and play at the installation of a new organ, or to\r\nsuperintend the construction of an organ, or to lead a chorus. Gradually\r\nhis fame grew, and although he might have lived his life and ended his\r\ndays there in the rural and peaceful quiet of Weimar, yet he harkened to\r\nthe voice and arose and went forth with his family into a place that\r\nafforded a wider scope for his powers.\r\n\r\nAs Kapellmeister to the Court at Kothen he had the direction of a large\r\norchestra, and it seems also supervised a school of music.\r\n\r\nWhen the Court moved about from place to place it was the custom to take\r\nthe orchestra, too, in order to reveal to the natives along the way what\r\ngood music really was. This was all quite on the order of the Duke of\r\nMantua, who used to travel with a retinue of two hundred servants and\r\nattendants.\r\n\r\nOn one such occasion the Kothen Court went to Carlsbad. The visit\r\nextended itself to six months, when Bach became impatient to return to\r\nhis family, and was allowed to go in advance of the rest of the company.\r\nOn reaching home he found his wife had died and been buried several\r\nweeks before.\r\n\r\nIt was a severe shock to the poor man, but fortunately there was more\r\nphilosophy to his nature than romance, which is a marked trait in the\r\nGerman character. All this is plainly evidenced by the fact that in many\r\nGerman churches when a good wife dies, the pastor, at the funeral, as\r\nthe best friend of the stricken husband, casts his eyes over the\r\ncongregation for a suitable successor to the deceased. And very often\r\nthe funeral baked meats do coldly furnish forth the marriage feast. Man\r\nis made to mourn, but most widowers say but a year.\r\n\r\nThe prompt second marriage of Bach was certainly a compliment to the\r\nmemory of his first wife, who was a most amiable helpmeet and friend. No\r\nsoft sentiment disturbed the deep immersement of this man in his work.\r\nHe was as businesslike a man as Ralph Waldo Emerson, who arranged his\r\nsecond marriage by correspondence, and then drove over in a buggy one\r\nafternoon to bring home the promised bride, making notes by the way on\r\nthe Over-Soul and man's place in the Universal Cosmos.\r\n\r\nEvents proved the wisdom of Johann Sebastian Bach's choice. His first\r\nwife filled his heart, but this one was not only to do as much, but\r\noften to guide his hand and brain. He was thirty-eight with a brood of\r\nnine. Anna Magdalena was twenty-three, strong, fancy-free, and by a\r\ndozen, lacking one, was to increase the limit.\r\n\r\nAs the years went by, Bach occasionally would arise in public places,\r\nand with uncovered head thank God for the blessings He had bestowed upon\r\nhim, especially in sending him such a wife.\r\n\r\nAnna Magdalena Wulken was a singer of merit, a player on the harp, and a\r\nperson of education. She certainly had no seraglio notions of wanting to\r\nbe petted and pampered and taken care of, or she would not have assumed\r\nthe office of stepmother to that big family and married a poor man. Bach\r\nnever had time to make money. Very soon after their marriage Bach began\r\nto dictate music to his wife. A great many pieces can be seen in Leipzig\r\nand Berlin copied out in her fine, painstaking hand, with an occasional\r\ninterlining by the Master. Other pieces written by him are amended by\r\nher, showing plainly that they worked together.\r\n\r\nAs proof that this was no honeymoon whim, the collaboration continued\r\nfor over a score of years, in spite of increasing domestic\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\nFrom Kothen, Bach was called to Leipzig and elected by the municipal\r\nauthorities the Musical Director and Cantor of the Thomas School. For\r\ntwenty-seven years he labored here, doing the work he liked best, and\r\ndoing it in his own way. He escaped the pitfalls of petty jealousies,\r\ninto which most men of artistic natures fall, by rising above them all.\r\nHe accepted no insults; he had no grievances against either man or fate;\r\nearnest, religious, simple--he filled the days with useful effort.\r\n\r\nHe was so well poised that when summoned by Frederick the Great to come\r\nand play before him, he took a year to finish certain work he had on\r\nhand before he went. Then he would have forgotten the engagement, had\r\nnot his son, who was Chamber Musician to the King, insisted that he\r\ncome. In the presence of Frederick it was the King who was abashed, not\r\nhe. He knew his kinship to Divinity so well that he did not even think\r\nto assert it. And surely he was one fit to stand in the presence of\r\nkings. For number, variety and excellence, only two men can be named as\r\nhis competitors: these are Mozart and Handel. But in point of\r\nperformance, simplicity and sterling manhood, Bach stands alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FELIX MENDELSSOHN]\r\n\r\nFELIX MENDELSSOHN\r\n\r\n\r\n     The correspondence of Goethe and Zelter displeases me. I always\r\n     feel out of sorts when I have been reading it. Do you know that I\r\n     am making great strides in water-colors? Schirmer comes to me every\r\n     Saturday at eleven, and paints for two hours at a landscape, which\r\n     he is going to make me a present of, because the subject occurred\r\n     to him whilst I was playing the little \"Rivulet\" (which you know).\r\n     It represents a fellow who saunters out of a dark forest into a\r\n     sunny little nook; trees all about, with stems thick and thin; one\r\n     has fallen across the rivulet; the ground is carpeted with soft,\r\n     deep moss, full of ferns; there are stones garlanded with\r\n     blackberry-bushes; it is fine warm weather; the whole will be\r\n     charming.\r\n\r\n     --_Mendelssohn to Devrient_\r\n\r\n\r\nFELIX MENDELSSOHN\r\n\r\nThirty-eight years is not a long life, but still it is long enough to do\r\ngreat things. Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy was born in the year Eighteen\r\nHundred Nine, at Hamburg, and died at Leipzig in the year Eighteen\r\nHundred Forty-seven. His career was a triumphal march. The road to\r\nsuccess with him was no zigzag journey--from the first he went straight\r\nto the front. Whether as a baby he crowed in key, and cried to a\r\none-two-three melody, as his old nurse used to aver, is a little\r\ndoubtful, possibly. But all agree that he was the most precocious\r\nmusical genius that ever lived, excepting Mozart; and Goethe, who knew\r\nthem both, declared that Mendelssohn's music bore the same relationship\r\nto Mozart's as the talk of a grown-up cultured person to the prattle of\r\na child.\r\n\r\nBut then Goethe was not a musician, and sixty years had passed from the\r\ntime Goethe saw Mozart before he met Mendelssohn. Goethe loved the\r\nbrown-curled Jewish boy at sight; and whether on meeting Mozart he ever\r\nrecovered from the taint of prejudice that most people feel when a\r\nprodigy is introduced, is a question.\r\n\r\nBut who can wonder that the old poet's heart went out to the youthful\r\nMendelssohn as soon as he saw him!\r\n\r\nHe was a being to fill a poet's dream--such a youth as the Old Masters\r\nused to picture as the Christ when He confounded the wise men. And then\r\nthe painters posed this same type of boy as Daniel in the lions' den;\r\nand back in the days of Pericles, the Greeks were fond of showing the\r\nbeautiful youth, just approaching adolescence, in the nude, as the god\r\nof Love. When the face has all the soft beauty of a woman, and the\r\nfigure, slight, slender, lithe and graceful, carries only a suggestion\r\nof the masculine strength to come--then beauty is at perihelion. The\r\n\"Eros\" of Phidias was not the helpless, dumpy cherub \"Cupid\"--he was a\r\nslender-limbed boy of twelve years who showed collar-bone and revealed\r\nevery rib.\r\n\r\nBeauty and strength of the highest type are never complete--their lure\r\nlies in a certain reserve, and behind all is a suggestion of unfoldment.\r\nMaturity is not the acme of beauty, because in maturity there is nothing\r\nmore to hope for--only the uncompleted fills the heart, for from it we\r\nconstruct the Ideal.\r\n\r\nGoethe looked out of his window and seeing Felix Mendelssohn playing\r\nwith the children, exclaimed to Zelter, \"He is a Greek god in the germ,\r\nand I here solemnly protest against his wearing clothes.\"\r\n\r\nThe words sound singularly like the remark of Doctor Schneider, made ten\r\nyears later, when Herr Doctor removed the sheet that covered the dead\r\nbody of Goethe, and gazing upon the full-rounded limbs, the mighty\r\nchest, the columnar neck and the Jovelike head, exclaimed, \"It is the\r\nbody of a Greek god!\" And the surgeons stood there in silent awe,\r\nforgetful of their task.\r\n\r\nZelter, who introduced Mendelssohn to Goethe, was a fine old character,\r\nnearly as fine a type as Goethe himself. Heine once said, \"Musicians\r\nconstitute a third sex.\" And that there have been some unsexed, or at\r\nleast unmanly men, who were great musicians, need not be denied. The art\r\nof music borders more closely upon the dim and mystic realms of the\r\ninspirational than any of the other arts. Music refuses to give up its\r\nsecrets in a formula and at last eludes the sciolist with his ever-ready\r\ntheorem. But still, all musicians are not dreamers. Zelter, for\r\ninstance, was a most hard-headed, practical man: a positivist and\r\nmathematician with a turn for economics, and a Gradgrind for facts. He\r\nwas a stone-mason, and worked at his trade at odd times all through his\r\nlife, just because he felt it was every man's duty to work with his\r\nhands. Imagine Tolstoy playing the piano and composing instead of making\r\nshoes, and you have Zelter.\r\n\r\nThis curious character was bound to the Mendelssohn family by his love\r\nfor Moses Mendelssohn, the grandfather of Felix. Moses Mendel added the\r\n\"sohn\" in loving recognition of his father, just as \"Bartholdy\" was\r\nadded by the father of Felix in loving token to his wife. It was the\r\ngrandfather of Felix who first gave glory to the name. We sometimes\r\nforget that Moses Mendelssohn was one of the greatest thinkers Germany\r\nhas produced--the man who summed up in his own head all the philosophy\r\nof the time and gave Spinoza to the world. This was the man to whom the\r\nerratic Zelter was bound in admiration, and when it was suggested that\r\nhe teach musical composition to the grandchild of his idol, he accepted\r\nthe post with zest.\r\n\r\nBut there came a shade of disappointment to the grim and bearded Zelter\r\nwhen he failed to find a trace of resemblance between the child and the\r\nchild's grandfather. The boy was sprightly, emotional, loving; and could\r\nplay the piano from his tenth year better than Zelter himself. When\r\nGoethe teasingly suggested this fact, Zelter replied, \"You mean he plays\r\ndifferent, not better.\" Goethe apologized.\r\n\r\nYet the boy was not a philosopher, and this grieved Zelter, who wanted\r\nhim to be the grandson of his grandfather, and a musician besides.\r\n\r\nThe lad's skill in composition, however, soon turned the old teacher's\r\nfears into joy. Such a pupil he had never had before! And he did not\r\nreason it out that no one else had ever had, either. The child, like\r\nChopin, read music before he read print, and improvised, merging one\r\ntune with another, bringing harmony out of hopeless chaos. Zelter\r\nfollowed, fearing success would turn the boy's head--berating, scolding,\r\nchiding, encouraging--and all the time admiring and loving. The pretty\r\nboy was not much frightened by the old man's rough ways, but seized\r\nupon such of the instruction as he needed and filled in the rest with\r\nhis own peerless soul.\r\n\r\nThe parents were astounded at such progress. At first they had wished\r\nmerely to round out the boy's education with a proper amount of musical\r\ninstruction, and now they reluctantly allowed the old teacher to have\r\nhis way--the lad must make his career a musical one. The boy composed a\r\ncantata, which was given in the parlors of his parents' home, with an\r\norchestra secured for the occasion. Felix stood on a chair and led his\r\nband of musicians with that solemn dignity which was his through life.\r\nZelter grumbled, ridiculed and criticized--that was the way he showed\r\nhis interest. The old musician declared they were making a \"Miss Nancy\"\r\nof his pupil--saturating him with flattery, and he threatened to resign\r\nhis office--most certainly not intending to do so.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Zelter threw out the hint that he was going\r\ndown to Weimar to see his friend Goethe--would Felix like to go? Felix\r\nwould be delighted, and when the boy's father and mother were\r\ninterviewed, they were pleased, too, at the prospect of their boy's\r\nmaking the acquaintance of the greatest poet of Germany. Felix was duly\r\ncautioned about how he should conduct himself. He promised, of course,\r\nand also agreed to write a letter home every day, recording the exact\r\nlanguage that the author of \"Werther\" used in his presence.\r\n\r\nGoethe and the Carlylian Zelter had been cronies for many years. The\r\npoet delighted in the company of the gruff old stone-mason musician, and\r\ntogether they laughed at the world over their pipes and mugs. And\r\nsometimes, alas, they hotly argued and raised their voices in\r\ndonner-und-blitzen style, as Germans have been known to do. Yet they\r\nwere friends, and the honest Zelter's yearly visits were as a godsend to\r\nthe old poet, who was often pestered to distraction by visitors who only\r\nvoiced the conventional, the inconsequential and absurd. Here was a man\r\nwho tried his steel.\r\n\r\nNow, Zelter had his theories about teaching harmony--theories too finely\r\nspun for any one but himself to grasp. Possibly he himself did not seize\r\nthem very firmly, but only argued them in a vain attempt to clear the\r\nmatter up in his own mind. The things we are not quite sure of are those\r\nupon which we insist.\r\n\r\nGoethe had pooh-poohed and smitten the table with his \"stein\" in denial.\r\n\r\nAnd now Zelter, the frank and bold, stealthily and by concocted plot and\r\nplan took his pupil, Felix Mendelssohn, with him on a visit to Weimar.\r\nHe wanted to confound his antagonist and to reveal by actual proof the\r\nsuccess that could be achieved where correct methods of instruction were\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nJean Jacques had written a novel showing what right theories, properly\r\nfollowed up, could do for his hero. Zelter had done better--he exhibited\r\nthe youth.\r\n\r\n\"A girl in boy's clothes, I do believe,\" said Goethe, with his usual\r\nbanter, in the evening when a little company had gathered in the\r\nparlors. Felix sat on his teacher's knee, with his arms around the old\r\nman's neck, girl-like. \"Does he play?\" continued Goethe, going over and\r\nopening the piano.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, a little!\" answered Zelter indifferently.\r\n\r\nThe ladies insisted--they always had music when Zelter made them a\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\n\"Come, make some noise and awaken the spirits that have so long lain\r\nslumbering!\" ordered the old poet.\r\n\r\nZelter advanced to the piano and played a stiff, formal little tune of\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nHe arose and motioned to Felix.\r\n\r\n\"Play that!\" said the teacher.\r\n\r\nThe child sat down, and with an impatient little gesture and half-smile\r\nat the audience, played the piece exactly as Zelter had played it, with\r\na certain drawling style that was all Zelter's own. It was so funny that\r\nthe listeners burst into shouts of laughter. But the boy instantly\r\nrestored order by striking the bass a strong stroke with both hands,\r\nrunning the scale, and weaving that simple little air into the most\r\ncurious variations.\r\n\r\nFor ten minutes he played, bringing in Zelter's little tune again and\r\nagain, and then Zelter in a voice of pretended wrath cried, \"Cease that\r\ntin-pan drumming and play something worth while.\"\r\n\r\nGoethe arose, stroked the boy's pretty brown curls, kissed him on the\r\nforehead and said: \"Yes, play something worth while. I know you two\r\nrogues--you have been practising on that piece for a year or more, and\r\nnow you pretend to be improvising--I'll see whether you can play!\"\r\n\r\nAnd going to a portfolio he took out a manuscript piece of music written\r\nout in the fine, delicate hand of Mozart, and placed it on the\r\nmusic-rack of the piano. Felix played the piece as if it were his own;\r\nand then laying it aside, went back and played it through from memory.\r\n\r\nThen piece after piece was brought out for him to play, and Zelter\r\nleaned back and by his manner said, \"Oh, it is nothing!\"\r\n\r\nAnd certainly it was nothing to the boy--he played with such ease that\r\nhis talent was quite unknown to himself. He had not yet discovered that\r\nevery one could not produce music just as they could talk.\r\n\r\nGoethe's admiration for the boy was unbounded. The two weeks of\r\nMendelssohn's prescribed visit had expired and Goethe begged for an\r\nextension of two weeks more. Every evening there was the little\r\nimpromptu concert. After that Felix paid various visits to Weimar.\r\nGoethe's house was his home, and the affection between the old poet and\r\nthe young musician was very gentle and very firm. \"All souls are of one\r\nage,\" says Swedenborg. Goethe was seventy-three and Mendelssohn thirteen\r\nwhen they first met, but very soon they were as equals--boys together.\r\n\r\nGoethe was a learner to the day of his passing: he wanted to know. In\r\nthe presence of those who had followed certain themes further than he\r\nhad, he was as an eager, curious child. When Goethe was seventy-eight\r\nand Mendelssohn eighteen, they spent another month together; and a\r\nregular program of instruction was laid out. Each morning at precisely\r\nnine, they met for the poet's \"music lesson,\" as Goethe called it, and\r\nthe boy would play from some certain composer, showing the man's\r\npeculiar style, and the features that differentiated him from others.\r\nGoethe himself has recorded in his correspondence that it was Felix\r\nMendelssohn who taught him of Hengstenberg and Spontini, introduced him\r\nto Hegel's \"Æsthetics,\" and revealed to him for the first time the\r\nwonders of Beethoven.\r\n\r\nCan you not close your eyes and see them--the mighty giant of fourscore,\r\nwith his whitened locks, and the slight, slender, handsome boy?\r\n\r\nThe old man is seated in his armchair near the window that opens on the\r\ngarden. The youth is at the piano and plays from time to time to\r\nillustrate his thought, then turns and talks, and the old man nods in\r\nrecognition. The boy sings and the old man chords in with a deep, mellow\r\nbass which the years have not subdued.\r\n\r\nWhen there are others present these two may romp, joke and talk\r\nmuch--masking their hearts by frivolity--but together they sit in\r\nsilence, or speak only in lowered voices as all true lovers always do.\r\nTheir conversation is sparse and to the point; each is mindful of the\r\ndignity and worth that the other possesses: each recognizes the respect\r\nthat is due to the mind that knows and the heart that feels. \"All souls\r\nare of one age.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith one exception, Felix Mendelssohn was unlike all the great composers\r\nwho lived before him--he was born in affluence; during his life all the\r\nmoney he could use was his. No struggle for recognition marked his\r\ngrowth. He never knew the pang of being misunderstood by the public he\r\nsought to serve. Whether these things were to his lasting disadvantage,\r\nas many aver, will forever remain a question of opinion.\r\n\r\nFelix Mendelssohn was the culminating flower of a long line of exquisite\r\nculture. He was an orchid that does not reproduce itself. With him died\r\nthe race. All that beauty of soul, vivacity, candor and sparkling\r\ngaiety, with the nerved-up capacity for work, were but the flaring up of\r\nlife ere it goes out in the night of death. Such men never found either\r\na race or a school. They are the comets that dash across the plane of\r\nour vision, obeying no orbit, leaving behind only a memory of blinding\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe character of Mendelssohn was distinctly feminine, and it follows\r\nthat his music should be played by men and not by women, otherwise we\r\nget a suggestion of softness and tameness that is apt to pall. Man, like\r\nDeity, creates in his own image.\r\n\r\nSorrow had never pierced the heart of this prosperous and very\r\nrespectable person.\r\n\r\nHe was never guilty of indiscretion or excess, and no demon of\r\ndiscontent haunted his dreams.\r\n\r\nIn Mendelssohn's music we get no sense of Titanic power such as we feel\r\nwhen \"Wagner\" is being played; no world problems vex us. The delicate,\r\nplaintive, spiritual seductions of Chopin, who swept the keys with an\r\ninsinuating gossamer touch, are not there. The brilliant extravaganzas\r\nof Liszt--passages illumined by living lightning--are wholly wanting.\r\nBut in it all you feel the deep, measured pulse of a religious\r\nconviction that never halts nor doubts. There are grace, ease, beauty,\r\nsweetness and exquisite harmony everywhere. In the \"Saint Paul,\" as in\r\nhis other oratorios, are such arias for the contralto as, \"But the Lord\r\nis mindful of His own\"; for the bass, \"God have mercy upon us,\" and for\r\nthe tenor, \"Be thou faithful unto death.\" These reveal pure and exalted\r\nmelody of highest type. It uplifts but does not intoxicate. Spontaneity\r\nis sacrificed to perfection, and the lack of self-assertion allows us to\r\nkeep our wits and admire sanely.\r\n\r\nHeinrich Heine, the pagan Jew, once taunted Mendelssohn with being a Jew\r\nand yet conducting a \"Passion Play.\" The gibe was a home-thrust and a\r\ncruel one, since Mendelssohn had neither the wit nor the mental\r\nacuteness to avoid the pink of the man who was hated by Jew and\r\nChristian alike. Towards the exiled Heine, Mendelssohn had only a\r\npatronizing pity--\"Why should any man offend the people in power?\" he\r\nonce asked.\r\n\r\nOnly the exiled can sympathize with the exile--only the downtrodden and\r\nthe sore-oppressed understand the outcast. Golgotha never came to\r\nMendelssohn, and this was at once his blessing and his misfortune.\r\n\r\nAnd the grim fact still remains that world-poets have never been\r\n\"respectable,\" and that the saviors of the world are usually crucified\r\nbetween thieves.\r\n\r\nIn life Mendelssohn received every token of approbation that men can pay\r\nto other men. For him wealth waited, kings uncovered, laurel bloomed and\r\nblossomed, and love crowned all. His popularity was greater than that of\r\nany other man of his time. He had no enemies, no detractors, no\r\nrivals--his pathway was literally and poetically strewn with roses. What\r\nmore can any man desire? Lasting fame and a name that never dies?\r\nAvaunt! but first know this, that immortality is reserved alone for\r\nthose who have been despised and rejected of men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSaintship is the exclusive possession of those who have either worn out,\r\nor never had, the capacity to sin.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Felix Mendelssohn he never had it--he was ever the\r\nbright, joyous, gracious, beautiful being that all his friends describe,\r\nand every one who met him was his friend thereafter. The character of\r\n\"Seraphael\" in the novel of \"Charles Auchester,\" by Miss Sheppard,\r\nportrays Mendelssohn in a glowing, seraphic light. The book reveals the\r\nemotional qualities of a woman given over to her idol, and yet the man\r\nis Mendelssohn--he was equal to the best that could be said of him.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of Miss Sheppard's book lies in the fact that she is so\r\ntrue to life that we tire of the goodness and beauty, and long for a\r\nrogue to keep us company and break the pall of a sweetness that cloys.\r\n\r\nThe bitterest thing Mendelssohn ever said of a public performer was to\r\ndescribe a certain prima donna as acting like an \"arrogant cook.\" All\r\nthe good orchestra leaders are supposed to have fine fits of frenzy when\r\nthey tear their hair in wrath at the discordant braying of careless\r\nplayers. But Mendelssohn never lost his temper. When his men played\r\nwell, as soon as the piece was done he went among them shaking hands,\r\ncongratulating and thanking them. This would have been a great stroke of\r\npolicy in the eyes of a groundling, for the action never failed to catch\r\nthe audience, and then the applause was uproarious. At such times\r\nMendelssohn seemed to fail in knowing the applause was for him, and\r\nappeared as one half-dazed or embarrassed, when suddenly remembering\r\nwhere he was, he would seize the nearest 'cello, violin or oboe, and\r\ndrag the astonished man to the front to share the honors and bouquets.\r\nIf this was artistry it was of a high order and should be ranked as art.\r\n\r\nI once heard Henry Irving make a speech at Harvard University, and shall\r\nnever forget the tremor in his voice and the half-embarrassment of his\r\nmanner. What could have been more complimentary to college striplings?\r\nAnd then, as usual, he looked helplessly about for Ellen Terry, and\r\nhaving located her, held out his hand toward her and led her to the\r\nfront to receive the homage.\r\n\r\nTears filled my eyes. Was Irving's action art? Ods-bodkins! I never\r\nthought of it: I was hypnotized and all swallowed up in loving\r\nadmiration for Sir Henry and the beautiful Lady Ellen.\r\n\r\nFelix Mendelssohn was beloved by his players. First, because he never\r\nwrote parts that only seraphs of light could play. In this he was unlike\r\nWagner, who could think such music as no brass, no wood nor strings\r\ncould perform, and so was ever in torments of doubt and disappointment.\r\nSecond, he was always grateful when his players did the best they could.\r\nThird, he was graciously polite, even at rehearsals. The extent of his\r\ninclination to rebuke was shown once when he abruptly rapped for\r\nsilence, and when quiet came said to his orchestra: \"I am sure that any\r\none of the gentlemen present could write a symphony. I think, too, that\r\nyou can all improve on the music of the past--even that of Beethoven.\r\nBut this afternoon we are playing Beethoven's music--will you oblige\r\nme?\" And every man awoke to the necessity of putting the sweet, subtile,\r\nstrong quality of the master into the work, instead of absent-mindedly\r\nsounding the note, fighting bluebottles, and taking care merely not to\r\nget off the key too much.\r\n\r\nAt the great Birmingham Festival several hundred ladies in the audience\r\ncontrived at a given signal to shower the great conductor with bouquets.\r\nAnd Mendelssohn, entering into the spirit of the fun, dexterously caught\r\nthe blossoms and tossed them to his players, not even forgetting the\r\ntriangles and the boys who played the kettledrums.\r\n\r\nBayard Taylor has described the lustrous brown eyes of Mendelssohn, that\r\nseemed to send rays of light into your own: \"Such eyes are the\r\npossession of men who have seen heavenly visions. Genius shows itself in\r\nthe eye. Those who looked into the eyes of Sir Walter Scott, Robert\r\nBurns or Lord Byron, always came away and told of it as an epoch in\r\ntheir lives. This was what I thought when I sat vis-a-vis with Felix\r\nMendelssohn and looked into his eyes. I did not hear his voice, for I\r\nwas too intent on gazing into the fathomless depths of those splendid\r\neyes--eyes that mirrored infinity, eyes that had beheld celestial glory.\r\nLittle did I think then that in two years those eyes would close\r\nforever.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Hensel, Felix Mendelssohn's sex-quality is finely\r\nrevealed, when he says that his friends are advising him to marry, and\r\nhe is on the lookout for a wife.\r\n\r\nYe gods! there is something strangely creepy about the thought of a man\r\ngoing out in cold blood to seek a wife. Only two kinds of men search for\r\na wife; one is the Turk, and the other is his antithesis, who is advised\r\nto marry for hygienic, prudential or sociologic reasons. John Ruskin was\r\n\"advised\" to marry and the matter was duly arranged for him. In a week\r\nhe awoke to the hideousness of the condition. Six years elapsed before\r\nJohn Millais and Chief Justice Coleridge collaborated to set him free,\r\nbut the cicatrix remained.\r\n\r\nThe great books are those the authors had to write to get rid of; the\r\nonly immortal songs are those sung because the singers could not help\r\nit. The best-loved wife is the woman who married because her lover had\r\nto marry her to get rid of her; the children that are born because they\r\nhad to be are the ones that stock the race; and the love that can not\r\nhelp itself is the only love that uplifts and inspires.\r\n\r\nFelix Mendelssohn, the slight, joyous, girlish youth, should have\r\npreserved his Cecilia-like virginity. He should have left marriage to\r\nthose who were capable of nothing else; this would not have meant that\r\nhe turn ascetic, for the ascetic is a voluptuary in disguise. He should\r\nsimply have been married to his work. The wonder is, though, that once\r\nthe thought of marriage was forced upon him, he did not marry a Hittite\r\nwho delighted in pork-chops and tomato-sauce, ordered Guinness Stout in\r\npublic places, and disciplined him as a genius should be disciplined.\r\n\r\nFate was kind, however, and the lady of his choice was nearly as\r\nesthetic in face and form, as gentle and spirituelle as himself. She\r\nnever humiliated him by cackle, nor led him a merry chase after\r\nsociety's baubles. Her only wish was to please him and to do her wifely\r\nduty. They pooled their weaknesses, and it need not be stated that this,\r\nthe only love in the life of Mendelssohn, made not the slightest impress\r\non his art, save to subdue it. The passing years brought domestic\r\nresponsibilities, and the every-day trials of life chafed his soul,\r\nuntil the wasted body, grown tired before its time, refused to go on,\r\nand death set the spirit free.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMendelssohn made five visits to England, where his success was even\r\ngreater than it was at home. He learned to express himself well in\r\nEnglish, but always spoke with the precision and care that marks the\r\neducated foreigner. So the result was that he spoke really better\r\n\"English\" than the English. The ease with which the Hebrew learns a\r\nlanguage has often been noted and commented upon. Mendelssohn preferred\r\nGerman, but was not at a loss to carry on a conversation in French,\r\nItalian or English.\r\n\r\nHis nature was especially cosmopolitan, and like the true aristocrat\r\nthat he was, he was also a democrat, and at home in any society.\r\n\r\nWhen he was invited by the Queen to call upon her at Buckingham Palace,\r\nhe went alone, in his afternoon dress, and sent in his card as every\r\ngentleman does when he calls upon a lady. Her Majesty greeted him at the\r\ndoor of her sitting-room, and dismissed the servants. They met as\r\nequals. In compliment to her guest Victoria spoke only in German. The\r\nQueen, seeing the music-rack was not in order, apologized, womanlike,\r\nfor the appearance of the room and began to dust things in the usual\r\nhousewifely fashion.\r\n\r\nMendelssohn, with that fine grace which never forsook him, assisted her\r\nin putting things to rights, and when the piano was opened, he proceeded\r\nto carry out two pet parrots, laughingly explaining that if they were to\r\nhave music, it was well to insure against competition.\r\n\r\nHe sat down at the piano and played, without being asked, and sang a\r\nlittle song in English in graceful but unobtrusive compliment to the\r\nhostess. Then the Queen sang in German, he playing the accompaniment.\r\nAnd in his letter to his sister Fanny, telling her of all this, in his\r\neasy, gossipy, brotherly way, Felix adds that the Queen has a charming\r\nsoprano voice, that only needs a little cultivation and practise to make\r\nher fit to take the leading part in \"Elijah.\"\r\n\r\nThis was no joke to Felix--he only regretted that Queen Victoria's\r\nofficial position was such that she could not spare enough time for\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nAlbert did not appear upon the scene until Mendelssohn had extended his\r\ncall to an hour, and was just ready to leave. The Prince Consort was too\r\nperfect a gentleman to ever obtrude when his wife was entertaining\r\ncallers, but now he apologized for not knowing the Meister had honored\r\nthem--which we hope was a white lie. But, anyway, Felix consented to\r\nremain and play a few bars of the oratorio they had heard him conduct\r\nthe night before. Then Albert sang a little, and Victoria insisted on\r\nmaking a cup of tea for the guest before they parted. When he went away,\r\nAlbert and Victoria both walked with him down the hall, and as he bade\r\nthem good-by, Victoria spoke the kindly \"Auf wiedersehen.\"\r\n\r\nIn the story of her life, Victoria has in spirit corroborated this\r\naccount of her meeting with Mendelssohn. She refers to him as her dear\r\nfriend and the friend of her husband, and pays incidentally a gentle\r\ntribute to his memory.\r\n\r\nThe universal quality of Mendelssohn's knowledge, his fine forbearance\r\nand diplomatic skill in leading a conversation into safe and peaceful\r\nwaters, were very marked. He was recognized by the King of Saxony as a\r\nking of art, and so was received into the household as an equal; and\r\nsurely no man ever had a more kingly countenance. His body, however,\r\nseemed to lag behind, and was no match for his sublime spirit. But when\r\nfired by his position as Conductor, or when at the piano, the slender\r\nbody was nerved to a point where it seemed all suppleness and sinewy\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Songs Without Words,\" the spirit of the Master is best shown.\r\nThere the grace, the gentleness and the sublimity of his soul are best\r\nmirrored. And if at twilight you should hear his \"On the Wings of Song,\"\r\nplayed by one who understands, perhaps you will feel his spirit near,\r\nand divine the purity, kindliness and excellence of Felix\r\nMendelssohn-Bartholdy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANZ LISZT]\r\n\r\nFRANZ LISZT\r\n\r\n\r\n     Were I to tell you what my feelings were on carefully perusing and\r\n     reperusing this essay, I could hardly find terms to express myself.\r\n     Let this suffice: I feel more than fully rewarded for my trials, my\r\n     sacrifices and artistic struggles, on noting the impression I have\r\n     made on you in particular. To be thus completely understood was my\r\n     only ambition; and to have been understood is the most ravishing\r\n     gratification of my longing.\r\n\r\n     --_Liszt in a Letter to Wagner_\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANZ LISZT\r\n\r\nIn writing of Liszt there is a strong temptation to work the superlative\r\nto its limit. In this instance it is well to overcome temptation by\r\nsuccumbing to it.\r\n\r\nThat word \"genius\" is much bandied, and often used without warrant; but\r\nfor those rare beings who leap from the brain of Jove, full-armed, it is\r\nthe only appellation. No finespun theory of pedagogics or heredity can\r\naccount for the marvelous talent of Franz Liszt--he was one sent from\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nYet we find a few fortuitous circumstances that favored his evolution.\r\nPossibly, on the other hand, there are those who might say the boy\r\nattracted to himself the human elements that he required, and thus\r\nworked out his freedom, acquiring that wondrous ability to express his\r\ninmost emotions. Art is the beautiful way of doing things. All art is\r\nthe expression of sublime emotions; and there seems a strong necessity\r\nin every soul to impart the joy and the aspiration that it feels. And\r\nfurther, art is for the artist first, just as work is for the worker--it\r\nis all just a matter of self-development. And how blessed is it to think\r\nthat every soul that works out its own freedom gives freedom to others!\r\nLiszt is the inspirer of musicians, just as Shakespeare is the inspirer\r\nof writers. Strong men make it possible for others to be strong. No man\r\nof the century gave the science of music such an impulse for good as\r\nthis man. To go no further in way of proof, let the truth be stated yet\r\nonce again, that it was Franz Liszt who threw a rope to the drowning\r\nWagner.\r\n\r\nOn October Twenty-second, in the year Eighteen Hundred Eleven, when a\r\nman-child was born at the village of Raiding, Hungary, the heavens gave\r\nno sign, and no signal-flags nor couriers proclaimed the event, all as\r\nhad been done a week before when a babe was born to the Prince and\r\nPrincess Esterhazy at the same place. Now the child born last was the\r\nson of obscure parents, the father being an underling secretary of the\r\nPrince, known as Liszt. The child was very weak and frail, and for some\r\nmonths it was thought hardly possible it could live; but Destiny decreed\r\nthat the boy should not perish.\r\n\r\nThe first recollections of Liszt take in, in a happy view, four men\r\nplaying cards at a square table. One of these men was the boy's father,\r\nanother was Mein Herr Joseph Haydn, and the other two players are lost\r\nin the fog of obscurity. Did they ever know what a wonderful game they\r\nplayed, as little Franz Liszt, sitting on a corner of the table,\r\nlistened to their talk and admired the buttons on the coat of the\r\nKappellmeister? After the card-game Haydn sat at the piano and played,\r\nand the boy, just three years old, thought he could do that, too. Then\r\nthere was another Kappellmeister in the employ of Prince Nicholas\r\nEsterhazy at Eisenstadt, and his name was Hummel. He was a pupil of\r\nMozart, and used to tell of it quite often when he came up to Raiding on\r\nlittle visits, after the wine had been sampled. Liszt the Elder used to\r\nhelp Hummel straighten out his accounts, and where went Liszt the Elder,\r\nthere, too, went little Franz Liszt, who wasn't very strong and banked\r\non it, and had to be babied. And so little Franz became acquainted with\r\nHummel and used to sit on his knee at the piano, and together they\r\nplayed funny duets that set the company in a roar--two tunes at a time,\r\nharmonious discords and counterpoint, such as no one ever heard before,\r\nor since.\r\n\r\nAt this time there was no piano at the Liszt cottage, but the boy\r\nlearned to play at the neighbors', and practised at the palace of the\r\nPrince. His father and mother once took him there to hear Hummel. On\r\nthis occasion Hummel played the Concerto by Reis in C minor. At the\r\nclose of the performance, little Franz climbed up on the piano-stool and\r\nvery solemnly played the same thing himself, to the immense delight of\r\nthe listeners.\r\n\r\nThe father of Liszt has recorded that at this time the child was but\r\nthree years old, but after taking off the proper per cent for the pride\r\nof a fond parent, the probabilities are the boy was five. This is the\r\nbetter attested when we remember that it was only a few weeks later\r\nthat, on the request of Prince Esterhazy, the boy played at a concert in\r\nOedenburg.\r\n\r\nThis launched the boy on that public career which was to continue for\r\njust seventy years. There is good evidence that the boy could read music\r\nbefore he could read writing, and that he threw into his playing such\r\nfeeling and expression as Ferdinand Reis, who merely imitated his\r\nmaster, Beethoven, had never anticipated. That is to say, when he played\r\n\"Reis,\" he improved on him, with variations all his own--attempts often\r\nmade with the work of great composers, but which incur risks not\r\nadvised.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Liszt, although born in poverty, was from the very\r\nfirst in a distinctly musical environment. He could not remember a time\r\nwhen he did not attend the band-concerts--his parents wanted to go, and\r\ntook the baby because there were no servants to take charge of him at\r\nhome. Music was in the air, and everybody discussed it, just as in Italy\r\nyou may hear the beggars in the streets criticizing art.\r\n\r\nThe delightful insouciance of this child-pianist won the heart of every\r\nhearer, and his success quite turned the head of his father, the worthy\r\nbookkeeper.\r\n\r\nTo give the child the advantages of an education was now his parents'\r\none ambition. Having no money of his own, the father importuned his\r\nemployer, the Prince, who rather smiled at the thought of spending time\r\nand money on such an elfin-like child. His playing was, of course,\r\nphenomenal, unaccountable, a sort of bursting out of the sun's rays,\r\nand, like the rainbow, a thing not to be seized upon and kept. It was\r\nmere precocity, and precocity is a rareripe fruit, with a worm at the\r\ncore. This discouragement of the over-ambitious father was probably\r\nwise, for it gave the boy a chance to play I-Spy and leapfrog in the\r\nstreets of the village, and to roam the fields. The lad became strong\r\nand well, and when ten years of age he had grown into a handsome\r\nyoungster with already those marks of will and purpose on his beautiful\r\nface that were to be his credentials to place and power.\r\n\r\nHe had often played at concerts in the towns and villages about, and\r\nwhen there were visitors at the palace this fine, slim son of the\r\nbookkeeper was sent for to entertain them.\r\n\r\nThis attention kept ambition alive in the hearts of his parents, and\r\nafter many misgivings they decided to hazard all and move to Vienna to\r\ngive their boy the opportunities they felt he deserved.\r\n\r\nThe entire household effects being sold, the bookkeeper found he had\r\nnearly six hundred francs--one hundred fifty dollars. To this amount\r\nPrince Esterhazy added fifty dollars, and Hummel gave his mite, and with\r\ntears of regret at breaking up the home-nest, but with high hope,\r\nflavored by chill intervals of fear, the father, mother and boy started\r\nfor Vienna.\r\n\r\nArriving in that city the distinguished Carl Czerny, pupil of Beethoven,\r\nwas importuned to take the lad. Only the letter from Hummel secured the\r\nboy an audience, for Czerny was already overburdened with pupils. But\r\nwhen he had listened to the lad's playing, he consented to take him as a\r\npupil, merely saying that he showed a certain degree of promise. It is\r\nsternly true that Czerny did not fully come into the Liszt faith until\r\nafter that concert of April Thirteenth, Eighteen Hundred Twenty-three,\r\nwhen Beethoven, ripe with years, crowded his way to the front and kissed\r\nthe player on both cheeks, calling him \"my son.\" Such a greeting from\r\nthe great Master spoke volumes when we consider the lifelong aversion\r\nthat Beethoven held toward \"prodigies,\" and his disinclination to attend\r\nall concerts but his own.\r\n\r\nAnd thus did Franz Liszt begin his professional pilgrimage, consecrated\r\nby the kiss of the Master.\r\n\r\nParis was the next step--to Paris, the musical and artistic center of\r\nthe world. To win in Paris meant fame and fortune wherever he wished to\r\nexhibit his powers. The way the name of Franz Liszt swept through the\r\nfashionable salons of Paris is too well known to recount. Scarcely\r\nthirteen years of age, he played the most difficult pieces with peculiar\r\nprecision and power. And his simple, boyish, unaffected manner--his\r\ntotal lack of self-consciousness--won him the affection of every\r\nmother-heart. He was fondled, feted, caressed, and took it all as a\r\nmatter of course. He had not yet reached the age of indiscretion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMusic is a secondary sexual manifestation, just as are the songs of\r\nbirds, their gay and gaudy plumage, the color and perfume of flowers\r\nthat so delight us, and the luscious fruits that nourish us--all is sex.\r\nAnd then, do you not remember that expression of Renan's, \"The\r\nunconscious coquetry of the flowers\"? Without love there would be no\r\npoetry and no music. All the manifest beauty of earth is only Nature's\r\nnuptial decoration.\r\n\r\nJames Huneker, not always judicious, but a trifle more judicial than\r\nothers that might be named, declares that two women, making a\r\nsimultaneous attack upon the great composer, caused him to cut for\r\nsanctuary, and hence we have the Abbe Liszt, thus proving again that\r\nlove and religion are twin sisters.\r\n\r\nThe old-time biographers can easily be placed in two classes: those who\r\nsought to pillory their man, and those who sought to protect him.\r\nNeither one told the truth; but each gave a picture, more or less\r\nblurred, of a being conjured forth from their own inner consciousness.\r\nFranz Liszt was naturalized in the Faubourg Saint Germain. It was here\r\nthat he was first hailed as the infant prodigy, and proud ladies, at his\r\nperformances, pressed to the front and struggled for the privilege of\r\nimprinting on his fair forehead a chaste and motherly kiss.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEight years had passed: years of work and travel and constant growing\r\nfame. The youth had grown into a man, and his return to the scene of his\r\nformer triumphs was the signal for a regathering of the clans to note\r\nhis progress--or decline. The verdict was that from \"Le Petit Prodige,\"\r\nhe had evolved into something far more interesting--\"Le Grand Prodige.\"\r\nTall, handsome, strong, and with a becoming diffidence and a half-shy\r\nmanner, his name went abroad, and he became the rage of the salons. His\r\nmarvelous playing told of his hopes, longings, fears and\r\naspirations--proud, melancholy, imploring, sad, sullen--his tones told\r\nall.\r\n\r\nFair votaries followed him from one performance to another. Leaving out\r\nof the equation such mild incidents as the friendship for George Sand,\r\nwhich began with a brave avowal of platonics, and speedily drifted into\r\nsomething more complex; also the equally interesting incident of his\r\nbeing invited to visit the Chateau of the lovely Adele Laprunarede, and\r\nthe Alpine winter catching the couple and holding them willing captives\r\nfor three months, blocked there in a castle, with nothing worse than a\r\nconscience and an elderly husband to appease, we reach the one, supreme\r\nlove-passion in the life of Liszt. The Countess d'Agoult is worthy of\r\nmuch more than a passing note.\r\n\r\nAt twenty years of age she had been married to a man twenty-one years\r\nher senior. It was a \"mariage de convenance\"--arranged by her parents\r\nand a notary in a powdered wig. It is somewhat curious to find how many\r\ngreat women have contracted just such marriages. Grim disillusionment\r\nfollowing, true love holding nothing in store for them, they turn to\r\nbooks, politics or art, and endeavor to stifle their woman's nature with\r\nthe husks of philosophy.\r\n\r\nCount d'Agoult was a hard-headed man of affairs--stern, sensible and\r\nreasonably amiable--that is to say, he never smashed the furniture, nor\r\nbeat his wife. She submitted to his will, and all the fine, girlish,\r\nbubbling qualities of her mind and soul were soon held in check through\r\nthat law of self-protection which causes a woman to give herself\r\nunreservedly only to the One who Understands. Yet the Countess was not\r\nmiserable--only at rare intervals did there come moods of a sort of\r\ndread longing, homesickness and unrest; but calm philosophy soon put\r\nthese moods to rout. She had focused her mind on sociology and had\r\nwritten a short history of the Revolution, a volume that yet commands\r\nthe respect of students. At intervals she read her essays aloud to\r\ninvited guests. She studied art, delved a little in music, became\r\nacquainted with the leading thinking men and women of her time, and\r\nopened her salon for their entertainment.\r\n\r\nThree children had been born to her in six years. Maternity is a very\r\nnecessary part of every good woman's education--\"this woman's flesh\r\ndemands its natural pains,\" says a great writer in a certain play. A\r\nstaid, sensible woman was the Countess d'Agoult--tall, handsome,\r\ngraceful, and with a flavor of melancholy, reserve and disinterestedness\r\nin her make-up that made her friendship sought by men of maturity. She\r\ntalked but little, and won through the fine art of listening.\r\n\r\nShe was neither happy nor unhappy, and if the gaiety of girlhood had\r\ngiven way to subdued philosophy, there were still wit, smiles and gentle\r\nirony to take the place of laughter. \"Life,\" she said, \"consists in\r\nmolting one's illusions.\"\r\n\r\nThe Countess was twenty-nine years of age when \"Le Grand Prodige,\" aged\r\ntwenty-three, arrived in Paris. She had known him when he was \"Le Petit\r\nProdige\"--when she was a girl with dreams and he but a child. She wished\r\nto see how he had changed, and so went to hear him play. He was\r\ninsincere, affected and artificial, she said--his mannerisms absurd and\r\nhis playing acrobatic. At the next concert where he played she sought\r\nhim out and half-laughingly told him her opinion of his work. He gravely\r\nthanked her, with his hand upon his heart, and said that such honesty\r\nand frankness were refreshing. After the concert Liszt remembered this\r\nwoman--she was the only one he did remember--she had made her\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nHe did not like her.\r\n\r\nSoon Liszt was invited to the salon of the Countess d'Agoult, and he,\r\nthe plebeian, proudly repulsed the fair aristocrat when her attentions\r\ntook on the note of patronage. They mildly tiffed--a very good way to\r\nbegin a friendship, once said Chateaubriand.\r\n\r\nThe feminine qualities in the heart of Liszt made a lure of the person\r\nwho dared affront him. He needed the flint on which his mind could\r\nstrike fire--nothing is so depressing as continual, mushy adulation. He\r\nsought out the Countess, and together they traversed the border-land of\r\nmetaphysics, and surveyed, as the days passed, all that intellectual\r\nrealm which the dawn of the Twentieth Century thinks it has just\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nShe taunted him into a defense of George Sand, who had but recently\r\nreturned from her escapade to Venice with Alfred de Musset. Liszt\r\ndefended the author of \"Leone Leoni,\" and read to the Countess from her\r\nbooks to prove his case.\r\n\r\nWhen haughty, proud and religious ladies mix mentalities with sensitive\r\nyouths of twenty-four, the danger-line is being approached. The Grand\r\nPassions that live in history, such as that of Abelard and Heloise,\r\nPetrarch and Laura, Dante and Beatrice, swing in their orbit around\r\nworld-weariness. Love does not concern itself with this earth alone--it\r\ndemands a universe for its free expression. And the only woman who is\r\ncapable of the Grand Passion--who stakes all on one throw of the\r\ndice--is the melancholy woman, with this fine, religious reserve. No one\r\nsuspected the Countess d'Agoult of indiscretion--she was too cold and\r\nself-contained for that!\r\n\r\nAnd so is the world deceived by the Eternal Paradox of things--that law\r\nof antithesis which makes opposites look alike. Beneath the calm dignity\r\nof matronly demeanor the fires of love were banked. Probably even the\r\nCountess herself did not know of the volcano that was smoldering in her\r\nheart. But there came a day when the flames burst forth, and all the\r\nreserve, poise, quiet dignity, caution and discretion were dissolved\r\ninto nothingness in love's alembic.\r\n\r\nPoor Franz Liszt!\r\n\r\nPoor Countess d'Agoult!\r\n\r\nThey were powerless in the coils of such a passion. It was a mad tumult\r\nof wild intoxication, of delicious pain, of burning fears, and vain,\r\ntossing unrest. The woman's nature, stifled by its six years of coaxing\r\nmarital repression, was asserting itself. Liszt did not know that a\r\nwoman could love like this--neither did the woman. Once they parted,\r\nafter talking the matter over solemnly and deciding on what was best for\r\nboth--they parted coldly--with a mere touching of the lips in a last\r\ngood-by.\r\n\r\nThe next week they were together again.\r\n\r\nThen Liszt fled to the Abbe Lamennais, and in tears sought, at the\r\nconfessional and in dim retirement, a surcease from the passion that was\r\ndevouring him. Here was a pivotal point in the life of Liszt, and the\r\nChurch came near then, claiming him for her own. And such would have\r\nbeen the case, were it not for the fact that one of the children of the\r\nCountess d'Agoult was sick unto death. He knew of the sleepless\r\nvigils--the weary watching of the fond mother.\r\n\r\nThe child died, and Franz Liszt went to the parent in her bereavement,\r\nto offer the solace of religion and bid her a decent, respectful\r\nfarewell, ere he left Paris forever. He thought grief was a cure for\r\npassion, and that in the presence of death, love itself was dumb. How\r\ncould he understand that, in most strong natures, tears and pain, and\r\nhope and love are kin, and that each is in turn the manifestation of a\r\ngreat and welling heart!\r\n\r\nLiszt stood by the side of the Countess as the grave closed over the\r\nbody of her firstborn child. And as they stood there, under the\r\ndarkening sky, her hand went groping blindly for his. She wrote of this,\r\nyears and years after, when seventy winters had silvered her hair and\r\nher steps were feeble--she wrote of this, in her book called,\r\n\"Souvenirs,\" and tells how, in that moment of supreme grief, when her\r\nlife was whitened and purified by the fires of pain, her hand sought\r\nhis. The deep current of her love swept the ashes of grief away, and she\r\nreached blindly for the hands--those wonderful music-making hands of\r\nLiszt--that they might support her. And standing there, side by side, as\r\nthe priest intoned the burial service, he whispered to her, \"Death shall\r\nnot divide us, nor is eternity long enough to separate thee from me!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was only a few days after that Liszt left Paris--but not for a\r\nmonastery. He journeyed to Switzerland, and stopping at Basle he was\r\nsoon joined by the Countess, her two children, and her mother.\r\n\r\nAll Paris was set in an uproar by the \"abduction.\" The George Sand\r\nschool approved and loudly applauded the \"eclat\"; but it was condemned\r\nand execrated by the majority. As for the injured husband, it is said he\r\ngave a banquet in honor of the event; his feelings, no doubt, being\r\neased by the fact that the goodly dot his wife had brought him at her\r\nmarriage was now his exclusive possession. He had never gauged her\r\ncharacter, anyway, and he inwardly acknowledged that her mind was of a\r\nsort with which he could not parry.\r\n\r\nAnd now she had wronged him; yet in his grief he took much satisfaction,\r\nand in his martyrdom there was sweet solace.\r\n\r\nThe chief blame fell on Liszt, and the accusation that he had \"broken up\r\na happy home\" came to his ears from many sources. \"They blame you and\r\nyou alone,\" a friend said to him.\r\n\r\n\"Good! good!\" said Liszt, \"I gladly bear it all.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Sand, plain in feature, quiet in manner, soft and feminine when\r\nshe wished to be, yet possessing the mind of a man, went to Switzerland\r\nto visit the runaway Liszt and the \"Lady Arabella.\" At first thought,\r\none might suppose that such a visit, after the former relationship,\r\nmight have been a trifle embarrassing for both. But the fact that in the\r\ninterval George Sand had been crunching the soul of Chopin formed an\r\nestoppel on the memory of all the soft sentiment that had gone before.\r\nGeorge Sand brought her two children, Maurice and Solange, and the \"Lady\r\nArabella\" had two of her own to keep them company. A little family party\r\nwas made up, and with a couple of servants and a guide, a little journey\r\nwas taken through the mountain villages, all in genuine gipsy style.\r\nGeorge Sand, who worked up all life, its sensations and emotions, into\r\ngood copy, has given us an account of the trip, that throws some very\r\ninteresting side-lights on the dramatis personæ.\r\n\r\nThe recounter and her children were all clothed in peasant\r\ncostume--man-style, with blouses and trousers. Gipsy garbs were worn by\r\nthe servants, and Liszt was arrayed like a mountaineer, and carried a\r\nreed pipe, upon which he, from time to time, awoke the echoes. When the\r\ndusty, unkempt crew arrived at a village inn, the landlord usually made\r\nhot haste to secrete his silverware. Once when a sudden rainstorm drove\r\nthe wayfarers into a church, Liszt took his seat at the organ and\r\nplayed--played with such power and feeling that the village priest ran\r\nout and called for the neighbors to come quickly, as the Angel Gabriel,\r\nin the guise of a mountaineer, was playing the organ. Anthem, oratorio,\r\nand sweet, subtle, soulful improvisation followed, and the villagers\r\nknelt, and eyes were filled with tears. George Sand records that she\r\nnever heard such playing by the Master before; she herself wept, and yet\r\nthrough her tears she managed to see a few things, and here is one\r\npicture which she gives us: \"The Lady Arabella sat on the balustrade,\r\nswinging one foot, and cast her proud and melancholy gaze over the lower\r\nnave, and waited in vain for the celestial voices that were supposed to\r\nvibrate in her bosom.\r\n\r\n\"Her abundant light hair, disheveled by the wind and rain, fell in\r\nbewildering disorder, and her eyes, reflecting the finest hue of the\r\nfirmament, seemed to be wandering over the realm of God's creation after\r\neach sigh of the huge organ, played by the divine Liszt.\r\n\r\n\"'This is not what I expected,' said she to me languidly.\r\n\r\n\"'Ah, that is what you said of the mountain peaks and the glacier,\r\nyesterday,' said I.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, by those who have read between the lines, that George\r\nSand did not much like \"the fair Lady Arabella of the wondrous length of\r\nlimb.\" In passing, it is well to note, in way of apology for this\r\nallusion as to \"length of limb,\" that George Sand was once spoken of by\r\nHeine as \"a dumpy-duodecimo.\" It is to be regretted that we have no\r\ndescription of George Sand by the Lady Arabella.\r\n\r\nYears passed in study and writing, with occasional concert tours,\r\nwherein the public flocked to hear the greatest pianist of his time. The\r\npower, grasp and insight of the man increased with the years, and\r\nwherever he deigned to play, the public was not slow in giving him that\r\napprobation which his masterly work deserved. Liszt was one of the Elect\r\nFew who train on. On these short concert trips his wife (for such she\r\nmust certainly be regarded) seldom accompanied him--this in deference to\r\nhis wish, and this, it seems, was the first and last and only cause of\r\ndissension between them.\r\n\r\nThe Countess was born for a career and her spirit chafed at the forced\r\nretirement in which she lived.\r\n\r\nTen years had gone by and three children had been born to her and Liszt.\r\nOne of these, a boy, died in youth, but one of the daughters became, as\r\nwe know, the wife of Richard Wagner, and the other daughter married\r\nOliver Emile Ollivier, the eminent statesman and man of letters--member\r\nof the Cabinet in that memorable year, Eighteen Hundred Seventy, when\r\nFrance declared war on Germany. Both of these daughters of Liszt were\r\nwomen of rare mentality and splendid worth, true daughters of their\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nPosition is a pillory; sometimes the populace will pelt you with\r\nrose-leaves--at others, with ancient vegetables. Liszt believed that for\r\nhis wife's peace of mind, and his own, she should not crowd herself too\r\nmuch to the front--he feared what the mob might say or do. We can not\r\nsay that she was jealous of his fame, nor he of hers. However, as a\r\nwriter she was winning her way. But the fateful day came when the wife\r\nsaid, \"From this day on I must everywhere stand by your side, your wife\r\nand your equal, or we must part.\"\r\n\r\nThey parted.\r\n\r\nLiszt made princely provision for her welfare, and the support of their\r\nchildren, as well as those that had come to her before they met.\r\n\r\nShe went south to Italy, and he began that most wonderful concert tour,\r\nwhere, in Saint Petersburg, sums equal to ten thousand dollars were\r\ntaken at the door for single entertainments.\r\n\r\nCountess d'Agoult was the respected friend of King Emmanuel, and her\r\nsalon at Turin was the meeting-place of such men as Renan, Meyerbeer,\r\nChopin, Berlioz and Rossini. She carried on a correspondence with\r\nHeinrich Heine, was the trusted friend of Prince Jerome Bonaparte,\r\nLamartine and Lamennais, and was on a footing of equality with the\r\ngreatest and best minds of her age. She wrote several plays, one of\r\nwhich, \"Jeanne d'Arc,\" was presented at the Court Theater of Turin, with\r\nthe Royal Family present, and was a marked success. Her criticism on the\r\nwork of Ingres made that artist's reputation, just as surely as Ruskin\r\nmade the fame of Turner. But one special reason why Americans should\r\nremember this woman is because she first translated Emerson's \"Essays\"\r\nand caused them to be published in Italian and French.\r\n\r\nI am not sure that Liszt ever quite forgave her for not dying of broken\r\nheart, when they parted there at Lake Maggiore. He thought she would\r\ntake to opium or strong drink, or both. She did neither, but proved, by\r\nher after-life, that she was sufficient unto herself. She was worthy of\r\nthe love of Liszt, because she was able to do without it. She was no\r\nparasitic, clinging vine that strangles the sturdy oak.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe Lamennais, the close friend of Liszt, once said, \"Liszt is a\r\ngreat musician, the greatest the world has ever seen, but his wife can\r\neasily take a mental octave which he can not quite span.\"\r\n\r\nThe Countess d'Agoult died March Fifth, in Eighteen Hundred Seventy-six,\r\nat the age of seventy years. When tidings of her passing reached the\r\nAbbe Liszt, he caused all of his immediate engagements to be canceled\r\nand went into monastic retirement, wearing the robe of horsehair and a\r\nrope girdle at his waist. He filled the hours for the space of a month\r\nwith silent reverie and prayer.\r\n\r\nAnd even in that cloister-cell, with its stone floor and cold, bare\r\nwalls, the leaden hours brought the soundless presence of a tall and\r\nstately woman. Through the desolate bastions of his brain she glided in\r\nsweet disarray, looked into his tear-dimmed eyes, smoothing softly the\r\ncoarse pillow where rested that head with its lion's mane which we know\r\nso well--a head now whitened by the frost of years. No sound came to him\r\nthere, save a soft voice which Fate refused to silence, and this voice\r\nwhispered and whispered yet again to him: \"Death shall not divide us,\r\nnor is eternity long enough to separate thee from me!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReligion is not the cure of love. Perhaps religion is love and love is\r\nreligion--anyway, we know that they are often fused. For a time after\r\nLiszt had parted from the Countess, fortune smiled. Then came various\r\nloans to friends, managerial experiments, the backing of an ill-starred\r\nopera, and a season of overwrought nerves.\r\n\r\nLuck had turned against the supposed invincible Liszt. Then it was that\r\nthe Princess Wittgenstein appears on the scene. This fine woman,\r\nearnest, strong in character, intellectual, had tried ten years of\r\nmarital hard times and quit the partnership with a daughter and a goodly\r\ndot.\r\n\r\nThe Princess had secretly loved Liszt from afar, and had followed him\r\nfrom town to town, glorying in his triumphs, feeding on his personality.\r\n\r\nWhen trouble came she managed to have a message conveyed to him that an\r\nunknown woman would advance, without interest or security, enough money\r\nfor him to pay all his debts and secure him two years of leisure in\r\nwhich he might regain his health and do such work as his taste might\r\ndictate.\r\n\r\nOf course Liszt declined the offer, begging his unknown friend to\r\ndivulge her identity that he might thank her for her disinterested faith\r\nin the cause of Art.\r\n\r\nA meeting was brought about and the result was as usual. The Grand\r\nDuchess of Saxe-Weimar, in the face of scandal, took the Abbe and\r\nPrincess under protection, giving them the Chateau of Altenburg, near\r\nWeimar, for a retreat. There Liszt, guarded from all intrusion, composed\r\nthe symphonies of \"Dante\" and \"Faust,\" sonatas, masses and parts of\r\n\"Saint Elizabeth.\" For thirteen years they lived an idyllic existence.\r\nThen, having married her daughter by her first husband to Prince\r\nHohenlohe, the Princess set out for Rome to obtain a dispensation from\r\nthe Pope, so she and the Abbe could be married. Her husband, who was a\r\nProtestant, had long before secured a divorce and married again. Pope\r\nPius the Ninth granted her wish, and she hastened home and prepared for\r\nthe wedding. It was said that flowers were already placed on the altar,\r\nthe marriage feast was prepared, the guests invited, when news came that\r\nthe Pope had changed his mind on the argument of one of the lady's\r\nkinsmen. We now have every reason to believe, though, that the Pope\r\nchanged his mind on the earnest request of Liszt.\r\n\r\nOn the death of the Princess Wittgenstein, the Pope dispensed Liszt from\r\nhis priestly ties, but he was called the Abbe until his death.\r\n\r\nWhenever I find any one who can write better on a subject than I can, I\r\nrefuse to go on.\r\n\r\nThere is a book called, \"Music Study in Germany,\" written by my friend\r\nAmy Fay, and published by The Macmillan Company, from which I quote.\r\n\r\nIf Amy Fay had not chosen to be the superb pianist that she is, she\r\nmight have struck thirteen in literature.\r\n\r\nThere are a dozen biographies of Liszt, but none of them has ever given\r\nus such a vivid picture of the man as has this American girl. The\r\nsimple, unpretentious little touches that she introduces are art so\r\nsubtile and true that it is the art which conceals art. The topmost\r\nturret of my ambition would be to have Amy Fay Boswellize my memory.\r\n\r\nSays Amy Fay:\r\n\r\n     Liszt is the most interesting and striking-looking man imaginable,\r\n     tall and slight, with deep-set eyes, long iron-gray hair, and\r\n     shaggy eyebrows. His mouth turns up at the corners, which gives him\r\n     a most crafty and Mephistophelian expression when he smiles, and\r\n     his whole appearance and manner have a sort of Jesuitical elegance\r\n     and ease. His hands are very narrow, with long and slender fingers\r\n     that look as if they had twice as many joints as other people's.\r\n     They are so flexible and supple that it makes you nervous to look\r\n     at them. Anything like the polish of his manner I never saw. When\r\n     he got up to leave the box, for instance, after his adieux to the\r\n     ladies, he laid his hand on his heart and made his final bow--not\r\n     with affectation, or in mere gallantry, but with a quiet\r\n     courtliness which made you feel that no other way of bowing to a\r\n     lady was right or proper.\r\n\r\n     But the most extraordinary thing about Liszt is his wonderful\r\n     variety of expression and play of feature. One moment his face will\r\n     look dreamy, shadowy, tragic; the next he will be insinuating,\r\n     amiable, ironical, sardonic; but always the same captivating grace\r\n     of manner. He is a perfect study. He is all spirit, but half the\r\n     time, at least, a mocking spirit, I should say. All Weimar adores\r\n     him, and people say that women still go perfectly crazy over him.\r\n     When he walks out, he bows to everybody just like a king! The Grand\r\n     Duke has presented him with a beautiful house situated on the Park,\r\n     and here he lives elegantly, free of expense.\r\n\r\n     Liszt gives no paid lessons whatever, as he is much too grand for\r\n     that, but if one has talent enough, or pleases him, he lets one\r\n     come to him and play to him. I go to him every other day, but I\r\n     don't play more than twice a week, as I can not prepare so much,\r\n     but I listen to others. Up to this point there have been only four\r\n     in the class beside myself, and I am the only new one. From four to\r\n     six o'clock in the afternoon is the time when he receives his\r\n     scholars. The first time I went I did not play to him, but listened\r\n     to the rest. Urspruch and Leitert, two young men whom I met the\r\n     other night, have studied with Liszt a long time, and both play\r\n     superbly.\r\n\r\n     As I entered the salon, Urspruch was performing Schumann's\r\n     \"Symphonic Studies\"--an immense composition, and one that it took\r\n     at least half an hour to get through. He played so splendidly that\r\n     my heart sank down into the very depths. I thought I should never\r\n     get on there! Liszt came forward and greeted me in a very friendly\r\n     manner as I entered. He was in a very good humor that day, and made\r\n     some little witticisms. Urspruch asked him what title he should\r\n     give to a piece he was composing. \"Per aspera ad astra,\" said\r\n     Liszt. This was such a good hit that I began to laugh, and he\r\n     seemed to enjoy my appreciation of his little sarcasm. I did not\r\n     play that time as my piano had only just come, and I was not\r\n     prepared to do so, but I went home and practised tremendously for\r\n     several days on Chopin's \"B minor sonata.\" It is a great\r\n     composition and one of his last works. When I thought I could play\r\n     it, I went to Liszt, though with a trembling heart. I can not tell\r\n     you what it has cost me every time I have ascended his stairs. I\r\n     can scarcely summon up courage to go there, and generally stand on\r\n     the steps a few moments before I can make up my mind to open the\r\n     door and go in.\r\n\r\n     Well, on this day the artists Leitert and Urspruch, and the young\r\n     composer Metzdorf, were in the room when I came. They had probably\r\n     been playing. At first Liszt took no notice of me beyond a\r\n     greeting, till Metzdorf said to him, \"Herr Doctor, Miss Fay has\r\n     brought a sonata.\" \"Ah, well, let us hear it,\" said Liszt. Just\r\n     then he left the room for a minute, and I told the three gentlemen\r\n     they ought to go away and let me play to Liszt alone, for I felt\r\n     nervous about playing before them. They all laughed at me and said\r\n     they would not budge an inch. When Liszt came back they said to\r\n     him, \"Only think, Herr Doctor, Miss Fay proposes to send us all\r\n     home.\" I said I could not play before such artists. \"Oh, that is\r\n     healthy for you,\" said Liszt with a smile, and added, \"you have a\r\n     very choice audience now.\" I don't know whether he appreciated how\r\n     nervous I was, but instead of walking up and down the room, as he\r\n     often does, he sat down by me like any other teacher, and heard me\r\n     play the first movement. It was frightfully hard, but I had studied\r\n     it so much that I managed to get through with it pretty\r\n     successfully. Nothing could exceed Liszt's amiability, or the\r\n     trouble he gave himself, and instead of frightening me, he inspired\r\n     me. Never was there such a delightful teacher! and he is the most\r\n     sympathetic one I've had. You feel so free with him, and he\r\n     develops the very spirit of music in you. He doesn't keep nagging\r\n     at you all the time, but he leaves you your own conception. Now and\r\n     then he will make a criticism or play a passage, and with a few\r\n     words give you enough to think of all the rest of your life. There\r\n     is a delicate point to everything he says as subtle as he is\r\n     himself. He doesn't tell you anything about the technique; that you\r\n     must work out for yourself. When I had finished the first movement\r\n     of the sonata, Liszt, as he always does, said \"Bravo!\" Taking my\r\n     seat he made some little criticisms, and then he told me to go on\r\n     and play the rest of it.\r\n\r\n     Now, I only half-knew the other movements, for the first one was so\r\n     extremely difficult that it cost me all the labor I could give to\r\n     prepare that. But playing to Liszt reminds me of trying to feed the\r\n     elephant in the Zoological Garden with lumps of sugar. He disposes\r\n     of whole movements as if they were nothing, and stretches out\r\n     gravely for more! One of my fingers fortunately began to bleed, for\r\n     I had practised the skin off, and that gave me a good excuse for\r\n     stopping. Whether he was pleased at this proof of industry, I know\r\n     not; but after looking at my finger and saying, \"Oh!\" very\r\n     compassionately, he sat down and played the whole three last\r\n     movements himself. That was a great deal and showed off his powers.\r\n     It was the first time I had heard him, and I don't know which was\r\n     the most extraordinary--the Scherzo, with its wonderful lightness\r\n     and swiftness, the Adagio with its depth and pathos, or the last\r\n     movement, where the whole keyboard seemed to \"donnern und blitzen.\"\r\n     There is such a vividness about everything he plays that it does\r\n     not seem as if it were mere music you are listening to, but it is\r\n     as if he had called up a real, living form, and you saw it\r\n     breathing before your face and eyes. It gives me almost a ghostly\r\n     feeling to hear him, and it seems as if the air were peopled with\r\n     spirits. Oh, he is a perfect wizard! It is as interesting to see\r\n     him as it is to hear him, for his face changes with every\r\n     modulation of the piece, and he looks exactly as he is playing. He\r\n     has one element that is most captivating, and that is a sort of\r\n     delicate and fitful mirth that keeps peering out at you here and\r\n     there. It is most peculiar, and when he plays that way, the most\r\n     bewitching expression comes over his face. It seems as if a little\r\n     spirit of joy were playing hide-and-go-seek with you.\r\n\r\n     At home Liszt doesn't wear his long Abbe's coat, but a short one,\r\n     in which he looks much more artistic. His figure is remarkably\r\n     slight, but his head is most imposing. It is so delicious in that\r\n     room of his! It was all furnished and put in order for him by the\r\n     Grand Duchess herself. The walls are pale gray, with a gilded\r\n     border running round the room, or rather two rooms, which are\r\n     divided, but not separated, by crimson curtains. The furniture is\r\n     crimson, and everything is so comfortable--such a contrast to\r\n     German bareness and stiffness generally. A splendid grand piano (he\r\n     receives a new one every year,) stands in one window. The other\r\n     window is always open and looks out on the park. There is a\r\n     dovecote just opposite the window, and doves promenade up and down\r\n     upon the roof of it, and fly about, and sometimes whirr down on the\r\n     sill itself. That pleases Liszt. His writing-table is beautifully\r\n     fitted up with things that match. Everything is in\r\n     bronze--inkstand, paper-weight, match-box, etc.--and there is\r\n     always a lighted candle standing on it by which he and the\r\n     gentlemen can light their cigars. There is a carpet on the floor, a\r\n     rarity in Germany, and Liszt generally walks about and smokes and\r\n     mutters, and calls upon one or the other of us to play. From time\r\n     to time he will sit down and himself play where a passage does not\r\n     suit him, and when he is in good spirits he makes little jests all\r\n     the time. His playing was a complete revelation to me, and has\r\n     given me an entirely new insight into music. You can not conceive,\r\n     without hearing him, how poetic he is, or the thousand nuances that\r\n     he can throw into the simplest thing, and he is equally great on\r\n     all sides. From the zephyr to the tempest, the whole scale is\r\n     equally at his command.\r\n\r\n     Liszt is not at all like a master, and can not be treated as one.\r\n     He is a monarch, and when he extends his royal scepter you can sit\r\n     down and play to him. You never can ask him to play anything for\r\n     you, no matter how much you're dying to hear it. If he is in the\r\n     mood he will play; if not, you must content yourself with a few\r\n     remarks. You can not even offer to play yourself.\r\n\r\n     You lay your notes on the table, so he can see that you want to\r\n     play, and sit down. He takes a turn up and down the room, looks at\r\n     the music, and if the piece interests him he will call upon you. We\r\n     bring the same piece to him but once, and but once play it through.\r\n\r\n     Yesterday I had prepared for him his \"Au Bord d'une Source.\" I was\r\n     nervous and played badly. He was not to be put out, however, but\r\n     acted as if he thought I had played charmingly, and then he sat\r\n     down and played the whole thing himself, oh, so exquisitely! It\r\n     made me feel like a wood-chopper. The notes just seemed to ripple\r\n     off his fingers' ends with scarce any perceptible motion. As he\r\n     neared the close I noticed that funny little expression come over\r\n     his face, which he always has when he means to surprise you, and he\r\n     then suddenly took an unexpected chord and extemporized a poetical\r\n     little end, quite different from the written one. Do you wonder\r\n     that people go distracted over him?\r\n\r\n     One day this week, when we were with Liszt, he was in such high\r\n     spirits that it was as if he had suddenly become twenty years\r\n     younger. A student from the Stuttgart conservatory played a Liszt\r\n     concerto. His name is V., and he is dreadfully nervous. Liszt kept\r\n     up a running fire of satire all the time he was playing, but in a\r\n     good-natured way. I shouldn't have minded it if it had been I. In\r\n     fact, I think it would have inspired me; but poor V. hardly knew\r\n     whether he was on his head or on his feet. It was too funny.\r\n     Everything that Liszt says is so striking. For instance, in one\r\n     place where V. was playing the melody rather feebly, Liszt suddenly\r\n     took his seat at the piano and said, \"When I play, I always play\r\n     for the people in the gallery, so that those people who pay only\r\n     five groschens for their seats also hear something.\" Then he began,\r\n     and I wish you could have heard him! The sound didn't seem to be\r\n     very loud, but it was penetrating and far-reaching. When he had\r\n     finished, he raised one hand in the air, and you seemed to see all\r\n     the people in the gallery drinking in the sound. That is the way\r\n     Liszt teaches you. He presents an idea to you, and it takes fast\r\n     hold of your mind and sticks there. Music is such a real, visible\r\n     thing to him that he always has a symbol, instantly, in the\r\n     material world to express his idea. One day, when I was playing, I\r\n     made too much movement with my hand in a rotary sort of a passage\r\n     where it was difficult to avoid it. \"Keep your hand still,\r\n     Fraulein,\" said Liszt; \"don't make omelet.\" I couldn't help\r\n     laughing--it hit me on the head so nicely. He is far too sparing of\r\n     his playing, unfortunately, and like Tausig, sits down and plays\r\n     only a few bars at a time generally. It is dreadful when he stops,\r\n     just as you are at the height of your enjoyment, but he is so\r\n     thoroughly blase that he doesn't care to show off before people and\r\n     doesn't like to have any one pay him a compliment about his\r\n     playing. In Liszt I can at least say that my ideal in something has\r\n     been realized. He goes far beyond all that I expected. Anything so\r\n     perfectly beautiful as he looks when he sits at the piano I never\r\n     saw, and yet he is almost an old man now. I enjoy him as I would an\r\n     exquisite work of art. His personal magnetism is immense, and I can\r\n     scarcely bear it when he plays. He can make me cry all he chooses,\r\n     and that is saying a good deal, because I've heard so much music,\r\n     and never have been affected by it. Even Joachim, whom I think\r\n     divine, never moved me. When Liszt plays anything pathetic, it\r\n     sounds as if he had been through everything, and opens all one's\r\n     wounds afresh. All that one has ever suffered comes before one\r\n     again. Who was it that I heard say once, that years ago he saw\r\n     Clara Schumann sitting in tears near the platform during one of\r\n     Liszt's performances? Liszt knows well the influence he has on\r\n     people, for he always fixes his eyes on some one of us when he\r\n     plays, and I believe he tries to wring our hearts. When he plays a\r\n     passage and goes pearling down the keyboard, he often looks over\r\n     at me and smiles, to see whether I am appreciating it.\r\n\r\n     But I doubt if he feels any particular emotion himself when he is\r\n     piercing you through with his rendering. He is simply hearing every\r\n     tone, knowing exactly what effect he wishes to produce and just how\r\n     to do it. In fact, he is practically two persons in one--the\r\n     listener and the performer. But what immense self-command that\r\n     implies! No matter how fast he plays you always feel that there is\r\n     \"plenty of time\"--no need to be anxious! You might as well try to\r\n     move one of the pyramids as fluster him. Tausig possessed this\r\n     repose in a technical way, and his touch was marvelous; but he\r\n     never drew the tears to your eyes. He could not wind himself\r\n     through all the subtle labyrinths of the heart as Liszt does. Liszt\r\n     does such bewitching little things! The other day, for instance,\r\n     Fraulein Gaul was playing something to him, and in it were two\r\n     runs, and after each run two staccato chords. She did them most\r\n     beautifully and struck the chords immediately after. \"No, no,\" said\r\n     Liszt; \"after you make a run you must wait a minute before you\r\n     strike the chords, as if in admiration of your own performance. You\r\n     must pause, as if to say, 'How nicely I did that!'\" Then he sat\r\n     down and made a run himself, waited a second, and then struck the\r\n     two chords in the treble, saying as he did so, \"Bravo!\" and then he\r\n     played again, struck the other chord and said again, \"Bravo!\" and\r\n     positively, it was as if the piano had softly applauded.\r\n\r\n     Liszt hasn't the nervous irritability common to artists, but on the\r\n     contrary his disposition is the most exquisite and tranquil in the\r\n     world. We have been there incessantly and I've never seen him\r\n     ruffled except two or three times, and then he was tired and not\r\n     himself, and it was a most transient thing. When I think what a\r\n     little savage Tausig often was, and how cuttingly sarcastic Kullak\r\n     could be at times, I am astonished that Liszt so rarely lost his\r\n     temper. He has the power of turning the best side of every one\r\n     outward, also the most marvelous and instant appreciation of what\r\n     that side is. If there is anything in you, you may be sure that\r\n     Liszt will know it. On Monday I had a most delightful tete-a-tete\r\n     with Liszt, quite by chance. I had occasion to call upon him for\r\n     something, and strange to say, he was alone, sitting by his table\r\n     writing. Generally all sorts of people are up there. He insisted\r\n     upon my staying for a while, and we had the most amusing and\r\n     entertaining conversation imaginable. It was the first time I ever\r\n     heard Liszt really talk, for he contents himself mostly with making\r\n     little jests. He is full of esprit. Another evening I was there\r\n     about twilight and Liszt sat at the piano looking through a new\r\n     oratorio which had just come out in Paris, upon \"Christus.\" He\r\n     asked me to turn for him, and evidently was not interested, for he\r\n     would skip whole pages and begin again, here and there. There was\r\n     only a single lamp, and that a rather dim one, so that the room was\r\n     all in shadow, and Liszt wore his Merlin-like aspect. I asked him\r\n     to tell me how he produced a certain effect he makes in his\r\n     arrangement of the ballad in Wagner's \"Flying Dutchman.\" He looked\r\n     very \"fin\" as the French say, but did not reply. He never gives a\r\n     direct answer to a direct question. \"Ah,\" said I, \"you won't tell.\"\r\n     He smiled and then immediately played the passage. It was a long\r\n     arpeggio, and the effect he made was, as I had supposed, a pedal\r\n     effect. He kept the pedal down throughout, and played the beginning\r\n     of the passage in a grand sort of manner, and then all the rest of\r\n     it with a very pianissimo touch, and so lightly, that the\r\n     continuity of the arpeggios was destroyed, and the notes seemed to\r\n     be just strewn in, as if you broke a wreath of flowers and\r\n     scattered them according to your fancy. It is a most striking and\r\n     beautiful effect, and I told him I didn't see how he ever thought\r\n     of it. \"Oh, I've invented a great many things,\" said he,\r\n     indifferently--\"this, for instance\"--and he began playing a double\r\n     roll of octaves in chromatics in the bass of the piano. It was very\r\n     grand and made the room reverberate.\r\n\r\n     \"Magnificent,\" said I.\r\n\r\n     \"Did you ever hear me do a storm?\" said he.\r\n\r\n     \"No.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Ah, you ought to hear me do a storm! Storms are my forte!\"\r\n\r\n     Then to himself between his teeth, while a weird look came into his\r\n     eyes as if he could indeed rule the blast, \"Then crash the trees!\"\r\n\r\n     How ardently I wished that he would \"play a storm,\" but of course\r\n     he didn't, and he presently began to trifle over the keys in a\r\n     blase style. I suppose he couldn't quite work himself up to the\r\n     effort, but that look and tone told how Liszt would do it. Alas,\r\n     that we poor mortals here below should share so often the fate of\r\n     Moses, and have only a glimpse of the Promised Land, and that\r\n     without the consolation of being Moses! But perhaps, after all, the\r\n     vision is better than the reality. We see the whole land, even if\r\n     but from afar, instead of being limited merely to the spot where\r\n     our foot treads.\r\n\r\n     Once again I saw Liszt in a similar mood, though his expression was\r\n     this time comfortably rather than wildly destructive. It was when\r\n     Fraulein Remmertz was playing his \"E flat concerto\" to him. There\r\n     were two grand pianos in the room; she was sitting at one, and he\r\n     at the other, accompanying and interpolating as he felt disposed.\r\n     Finally they came to a place where there was a series of passages\r\n     beginning with both hands in the middle of the piano, and going in\r\n     opposite directions to the ends of the keyboard, ending each time\r\n     with a short, sharp chord. \"Pitch everything out of the window!\"\r\n     cried he, and began playing these passages and giving every chord a\r\n     whack as if he were splitting everything up and flinging it out,\r\n     and that with such enjoyment that you felt as if you'd like to bear\r\n     a hand, too, in the work of demolition! But I never shall forget\r\n     Liszt's look as he so lazily proposed to \"pitch everything out of\r\n     the window.\" It reminded me of the expression of a big tabby-cat as\r\n     it sits by the fire and purrs away, blinking its eyes and seemingly\r\n     half-asleep, when suddenly--!--! out it strikes with both its\r\n     claws, and woe to whatever is within its reach!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEETHOVEN]\r\n\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN\r\n\r\n\r\n     Melody has by Beethoven been freed from the influence of Fashion\r\n     and changing Taste, and raised to an ever-valid, purely human type.\r\n     Beethoven's music will be understood to all time, while that of his\r\n     predecessors will, for the most part, only remain intelligible to\r\n     us through the medium of reflection on the history of Art.\r\n\r\n     --_Richard Wagner_\r\n\r\n\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN\r\n\r\nMusic is the youngest of the arts. Modern music dates back about four\r\nhundred years. It is not so old as the invention of printing. As an art\r\nit began with the work of the priests of the Roman Catholic Church in\r\nendeavoring to arrange a liturgy.\r\n\r\nThe medieval chant and the popular folk-song came together, and the\r\nscience of music was born. Sculpture reached perfection in Greece,\r\npainting in Italy, portraiture in Holland; but Germany, the land of\r\nthought, has given us nearly all the great musicians and nine-tenths of\r\nall our valuable musical compositions.\r\n\r\nHolland has taken a very important part in every line of art and\r\nhandicraft, and in way of all-round development has set the pace for\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nArt follows in the wake of commerce, for without commerce there is\r\nneither surplus wealth nor leisure. The artist is paid from what is left\r\nafter men have bought food and clothing; and the time to enjoy comes\r\nonly after the struggle for existence.\r\n\r\nWhen Venice was not only Queen of the Adriatic but of the maritime world\r\nas well, Art came and established there her Court of Beauty. It was\r\nVenice that mothered Giorgione, Titian, the Bellinis, and the men who\r\nwrought in iron and silver and gold, and those masterful bookmakers; it\r\nwas beautiful Venice that gave sustenance and encouragement to\r\nStradivari (who made violins as well as he could) up at Cremona, only a\r\nfew miles away.\r\n\r\nBut there came a day when all those seventy bookmakers of Venice ceased\r\nto print, and the music of the anvils was stilled, and all the painters\r\nwere dead, and Venice became but a monument of things that were, as she\r\nis today; for Commerce is King, and his capital has been moved far away.\r\n\r\nSo Venice sits sad and solitary--a pale and beautiful ruin, pathetic\r\nbeyond speech, infested by noisy shop-keepers and petty pilferers, the\r\ndegenerate sons of the robbers who once roamed the sea and enthroned her\r\non her hundred isles.\r\n\r\nAll that Venice knew was absorbed by Holland. The Elzevirs and the\r\nPlantins took over the business of the seventy bookmakers, and the\r\nart-schools of Amsterdam, Leyden and Antwerp reproduced every picture of\r\nnote that had been done in Venice. The great churches of Holland are\r\nreplicas of the churches of Venice. And the Cathedral at Antwerp, where\r\nthe sweet bells have chimed each quarter of an hour for three centuries,\r\nthrough peace and plenty, through lurid war and sudden death--there\r\nwhere hangs Rubens' masterpiece--that Cathedral is but an enlarged\r\n\"Santa Maria de' Frari,\" where for two hundred years hung \"The\r\nAssumption,\" by Titian.\r\n\r\nIn these churches of Holland were placed splendid organs, and the\r\npriests formed choirs, and offered prizes for the best singing and the\r\nbest compositions. Music and painting developed hand in hand; for at the\r\nlast, all of the arts are one--each being but a division of labor.\r\n\r\nThe world owes a great debt to the Dutch. It was Holland taught England\r\nhow to paint and how to print, and England taught us: so our knowledge\r\nof printing and painting came to us by way of the apostolic succession\r\nof the Dutch.\r\n\r\nThe march of civilization follows a simple trail, well defined beyond\r\ndispute. Viewed in retrospect it begins in a hazy thread stretching from\r\nAssyria into Egypt, from Egypt into Greece, from Greece to\r\nRome--widening throughout Italy and Spain, then centering in Venice, and\r\ntracing clear and deep to Amsterdam--widening again into Germany and\r\nacross to England, thence carried in \"Mayflowers\" to America.\r\n\r\nThat remark of Charles Dudley Warner, once near neighbor to Mark Twain,\r\nthat there is no culture west of Buffalo, was indelicate if not unkind;\r\nand residents of Omaha aver that it is open to argument. But the fact\r\nstands beyond cavil that what art we possess is traceable to our\r\nmasters, the Dutch.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the art of printing was first practised at\r\nMayence on the Rhine, leaving the Chinese out of the equation; but it\r\nhad to travel around down through Italy before it reached perfection.\r\nAnd its universality and usefulness were not fully developed until it\r\nhad swung around to Holland and was given by the Dutch back to Germany\r\nand the world. And as with printing, so with music. Germany has\r\nspecialized on music. She has succeeded, but it is because Holland gave\r\nher lessons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the fore part of the Seventeenth Century, there lived in Antwerp,\r\nLudvig van Biethofen, grandfather of the genius known as Beethoven. A\r\nlife-size portrait of him can be seen in the Plantin Musee, and if you\r\ndid not know that the picture was painted before Beethoven was born, you\r\nwould say at once, \"Beethoven!\" There is a look of stern endurance, as\r\nif the artist had admired Rembrandt's \"Burgomaster\" a little too well,\r\nyet that sturdiness belonged to the Master, too; and there are the\r\nabstracted far-away look, the touch of proud melancholy, and the\r\nbecoming unkemptness that we know so well.\r\n\r\nThe child is grandfather to the man. Beethoven bore slight resemblance\r\nto his immediate parents, but in his talent, habits and all of his\r\nmental traits, he closely resembled this sturdy Dutchman who composed,\r\nsang, led the military band, and played the organ at the Church of Saint\r\nJacques in Antwerp.\r\n\r\nBeing ambitious, Ludvig van Biethofen, while yet a young man, moved to\r\nBonn, the home of Clement Augustus, Archbishop-Elector of Cologne.\r\n\r\nThe chief business of elector was, in case of necessity, to elect a\r\nKing. America borrowed the elector idea from Germany. But our \"electoral\r\ncollege\" is a degenerate political appendicle that is continued,\r\nbecause, in borrowing plans of government, we took good and bad alike,\r\nnot knowing there was a difference. The elector scheme in the United\r\nStates is occasionally valuable for defeating the will of the people in\r\ncase of a popular majority.\r\n\r\nIn justice, however, let me say that the original argument of the\r\nColonists was that the people should not vote directly for President,\r\nbecause the candidate might live a long way off, and the voter could not\r\nknow whether he was fit or not. So they let the citizen vote for a wise\r\nand honest elector he knew.\r\n\r\nThe result is that we all now know the candidates for President, but we\r\ndo not know the electors. The electoral college in America is just about\r\nas useful as the two buttons on the back of a man's coat, put there\r\noriginally to support a sword-belt. We have discarded the sword, yet we\r\ncling to our buttons.\r\n\r\nBut the electors of Germany, in days agone, had a well-defined use. The\r\npeople were not, at first, troubled to elect them--the King did that\r\nhimself, and then as one good turn deserves another, the electors agreed\r\nto elect the successor the King designated, when death should compel him\r\nto abdicate. Then to fill in the time between elections, the electors\r\ndid the business of the King. It will thus be seen that every elector\r\nwas really a sort of King himself, governing his little State, amenable\r\nto no one but the King.\r\n\r\nAnd so the chief business of the elector was to keep the people in his\r\ndiocese loyal to the King.\r\n\r\nThere have always existed three ways of keeping the people loving and\r\nloyal. One is to leave them alone, to trust them and not to interfere.\r\nThis plan, however, has very seldom been practised, because the\r\npoliticians regard the public as a cow to be milked, and something must\r\nbe done to make it stand quiet.\r\n\r\nSo they try Plan Number Two, which consists in hypnotizing the public by\r\nmeans of shows, festivals, parades, prizes and many paid speeches,\r\nsermons and editorials, wherein and whereby the public is told how much\r\nis being done for it, and how fortunate it is in being protected and\r\nwisely cared for by its divinely appointed guardians. Then the band\r\nstrikes up, the flags are waved, three passes are made, one to the right\r\nand two to the left; and we, being completely under the hypnosis, hurrah\r\nourselves hoarse.\r\n\r\nPlan Number Three is a very ancient one and is always held back to be\r\nused in case Number Two fails. It is for the benefit of the people who\r\ndo not pass readily under hypnotic control. If there are too many of\r\nthese, they have been known to pluck up courage and answer back to the\r\nspeeches, sermons and editorials. Sometimes they refuse to hurrah when\r\nthe bass-drum plays, in which case they have occasionally been arrested\r\nfor contumacy and contravention by stocky men, in wide-awake hats, who\r\nlead the strenuous life. This Plan Number Three provides for an armed\r\nforce that shall overawe, if necessary, all who are not hypnotized. The\r\narmy is used for two purposes--to coerce disturbers at home, and to get\r\nup a war at a distance, and thus distract attention from the troubles\r\nnear at hand. Napoleon used to say that the only sure cure for internal\r\ndissension was a foreign war: this would draw the disturbers away, on\r\nthe plea of patriotism, so they would win enough outside loot to satisfy\r\nthem, or else they would all get killed, it really didn't matter much;\r\nand as for loot, if it was taken from foreigners, there was no sin.\r\n\r\nA careful analyst might here say that Plan Number Three is only a\r\nvariation of Plan Number Two--the end being gained by hypnotic effects\r\nin either event, for the army is conscripted from the people to use\r\nagainst the people, just as you turn steam from a boiler into the\r\nfire-box to increase the draft. Possibly this is true, but I have\r\nintroduced this digression, anyway, only to show that the original\r\noffice of elector was a wise and beneficent function of the Government,\r\nand could be revived with profit in America, to replace the outworn and\r\nuseless vermiformis that we now possess in way of an electoral college.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Kings allowed Church and State to separate they made a grave\r\nmistake. With the two united, as they were until a more recent time,\r\nthey held a cinch on both the souls and the bodies of their subjects.\r\n\r\nIn the good old days in Germany the elector was always an archbishop.\r\nOur bishops now are a weakling lot. With no army to back their edicts\r\nthe people smile at their proclamations, try on their shovel hats, and\r\nlaugh at their gaiters. Or if they be Methodist bishops, who are only\r\nmake-believe bishops, having slipped the cable that bound them to the\r\npast, we pound them familiarly on the back and address them as \"Bish.\"\r\n\r\nClement Augustus, Elector of Cologne, maintained a court that vied with\r\nroyalty itself. In his household were two hundred servants. He had\r\ncoachmen, footmen, cooks, messengers, a bodyguard, musicians, poets and\r\nartists who hastened to do his bidding. He patronized all the arts, made\r\na pet of science, offered a reward for the transmutation of metals,\r\ndabbled in astrology and practised palmistry.\r\n\r\nInto this brilliant court came the strong and masterful Ludvig van\r\nBiethofen.\r\n\r\nIn a year his gracious presence, superb voice and rare skill as a\r\nmusician, pushed him to the front and into favor with the powers, with a\r\nyearly salary of four hundred guilders. The history of this man is a\r\ndeal better raw stock for a romance than the life of his grandson.\r\n\r\nFrom Seventeen Hundred Thirty-two, when he entered the court as an\r\nunknown and ordinary musician with an acceptable tenor voice, to\r\nSeventeen Hundred Sixty-one, when he was Kapellmeister and a member of\r\nthe private council of the Elector, his life was a steady march\r\nsuccessward. Strong men were needed then as now, and his promotion was\r\ndeserved. Various accounts and mention of this man are to be found, and\r\none contemporary described him as he appeared at sixty. The only mark of\r\nage he carried was his flowing white hair. His smoothly shaven face\r\nshowed the strong features of a man of thirty-five; and his carriage,\r\nactions and superb grace as an orchestra-leader made him a conspicuous\r\nfigure in any company.\r\n\r\nLudvig van Biethofen had one son, Johann by name. This boy resembled his\r\ngifted father very little, and his training was such that he early fell\r\na victim to arrested development.\r\n\r\nIf a parent does everything for a child, the child probably will never\r\ndo anything for himself. It is Nature's plan--she seems to think that no\r\none needs strength excepting the struggler, and being kind she comes to\r\nhis rescue; but the man who puts forth no effort remains a weakling to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nJohann placed success beyond his reach very early in life by putting an\r\nenemy into his mouth to steal away his brains. His marriage to a\r\ndaughter of a cook in Ehrenbreitstein Castle did not stop his\r\nwaywardness, or give him decision as was hoped. Marriage as a scheme of\r\nreformation is not always a success, and women who lend themselves to it\r\ntake great chances.\r\n\r\nMary Magdalena was a widow, and some say possessed of wiles. That she\r\nwas beneath Johann in social station, but beyond him in actual worth,\r\nthere is no doubt. And whether she snared the incautious man, or whether\r\nthe marriage was arranged by the elder Biethofen as a diplomatic move in\r\nthe interests of morality, matters little. The end justifies the means;\r\nand as a net result of this mating, without putting forward the\r\ncircumstance as a precedent to be religiously followed, the world has\r\nBeethoven and his work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA plate affixed to Number Five Hundred Fifteen Bonngasse, Bonn, gives\r\nthe birth of Ludwig van Beethoven as December Seventeenth, Seventeen\r\nHundred Seventy. He was the second-born child of his mother, and after\r\nhim came a goodly assortment of boys and girls. Two of his brothers\r\nlived to exercise a sinister influence over the life of the Master, and\r\nto darken days that should have been luminous with love. Little Ludwig\r\nwas the pet and pride of the grandfather. The grandfather had even\r\ninsisted that the baby should bear his name. Disappointment in his own\r\nchild caused him to center his love in the grandchild. This instinct\r\nthat makes men long to live again in the lives of their children--is it\r\nreaching out for immortality? And as the grandfather virtually supported\r\nthe household, he was allowed to have his own way, and indeed that\r\nstrong, yet cheery will was not to be opposed. The old man prophesied\r\nwhat the boy would do, just as love ever does, and has done, since the\r\nworld began.\r\n\r\nBut only in his dreams was Ludvig van Biethofen to know of the success\r\nof his namesake. When the boy was scarce four years old, the old man\r\npassed away. The place in the orchestra that Johann held through favor\r\nwas soon forfeited, and times of pinching poverty followed, and sorrows\r\ncame like the gathering of a winter night.\r\n\r\nHave you never shared the mocking shame and biting pain of a drunkard's\r\nhousehold? Then God grant you never may. When the world withdraws its\r\nfaith from a man through his own imbecility, and employment is denied;\r\nwhen promises are unkept; when order and system are gone, and foresight\r\nfled, and loud accusation, threat and contumely vary their strident\r\ntones with maudlin protestations of affection, and vows made to be\r\nbroken, easily change to curses; when the fire dies on the hearth, and\r\nchildren huddle in bed in the daytime for warmth; when the scanty food\r\nthat is found is eaten ravenously, and blanching fear comes when a heavy\r\ntread and fumbling at the lock are heard in the hall--these things\r\nchallenge language for fit expression and cause words to falter.\r\n\r\nThe moody and dispirited Johann one day conceived a bright thought--a\r\nthought so vivid that for the moment it cleared the cobwebs from his\r\nmind and sobered his boozy brain--the genius of his five-year-old boy\r\nshould be exploited to retrieve his battered fortunes!\r\n\r\nThe child was already showing signs of musical talent; and diligent\r\npractise was now begun. Several chums at the beer-gardens were\r\ninterviewed and great plans unfolded in beery enthusiasm. The services\r\nof several of these men were secured as tutors, and one of them,\r\nPfeiffer, took lodgings with the Biethofens, and paid for bed and board\r\nin music-lessons.\r\n\r\nA new thought is purifying, ideas are hygienic; and already things had\r\nbegun to look brighter for the household. It wasn't exactly prosperity,\r\nbut Johann had found a place in the band, and was earning as much as\r\nthree dollars a week, which amount for two weeks running he brought home\r\nand placed in his wife's lap.\r\n\r\nBut things were grievous for young Beethoven: he had two taskmasters,\r\nhis father and Pfeiffer. One gave him lessons on the violin in the\r\nmorning, and the other took him to a tavern where there was a clavichord\r\nand made him play all the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThen occasionally Johann and Pfeiffer would come home at two o'clock in\r\nthe morning from a concert where they had been playing and where the\r\nwine was red and also free, and they would drag the poor child from his\r\nbed to make him play. This was followed up until the boy's mother\r\nrebelled, and on one occasion Pfeiffer and Johann were sent to the\r\nmilitary hospital and dry-docked for repairs.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, this man Pfeiffer was kindly and usually capable. In\r\nafter-years Beethoven testified to the valuable assistance he had\r\nreceived from him; and when Pfeiffer had grown old and helpless,\r\nBeethoven sent funds to him by the publishers, Simrock.\r\n\r\nYoung Ludwig was a stocky, sturdy youth, decidedly Dutch in his\r\ncharacteristics, with no nerves to speak of, else he would have laid him\r\ndown and died of heart-chill and neglect, as did four of his little\r\nbrothers and sisters. But he stood the ordeals, and at parlor, tavern\r\nand beer-garden entertainments where he played, although his cheeks\r\nwere often stained with tears, he took a sort of secret pride in being\r\nable to do things which even his father could not. And then he was\r\nalways introduced as \"Ludvig Biethofen, the grandchild of Ludvig van\r\nBiethofen,\" and this was no mean introduction. His appearance, even\r\nthen, bore strong resemblance to the lost and lamented grandfather; and\r\nVan den Eeden, the Court Organist, in loving remembrance of his Antwerp\r\nfriend, took the lad into his keeping and gave him lessons. When Van den\r\nEeden retired, Neefe, his successor, took a kindly interest in the boy\r\nand even protected him from his father and the zealous Pfeiffer. So well\r\nwas the boy thought of that when he was twelve years of age Neefe\r\nestablished him as his deputy at the chapel organ.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, the new Elector, Max Friedrich, bestowed on \"Louis\r\nvan Beethoven, my well-beloved player upon the organ and clavichord, a\r\nstipend of one hundred fifty florins a year, and if his talent doth\r\nincrease with his years the amount is to be also increased.\"\r\n\r\nIn token of the Elector's recognition Beethoven wrote three sonatas, the\r\nearliest of his compositions, and dedicated them to Max Friedrich in\r\nSeventeen Hundred Eighty-two.\r\n\r\nIn Seventeen Hundred Eighty-four, Elector Max Friedrich died, and Max\r\nFranz was appointed to take his place. His inauguration was the signal\r\nfor a renewal of musical and artistic activity. Concerts, shows and\r\nmilitary pageants followed the installation. In a list of court\r\nappointments we find that Louis van Beethoven is put down as \"second\r\norganist\" with a salary of forty-five pounds a year. Below this is\r\nJohann Beethoven with a salary of thirty pounds a year. And in one of\r\nthe court journals mention is made of Johann Beethoven with the added\r\nline, \"father of Ludwig Beethoven,\" showing even then the man's source\r\nof distinction.\r\n\r\nIn Seventeen Hundred Eighty-seven, when in his eighteenth year,\r\nBeethoven made a visit to Vienna in company with several musicians from\r\nthe Elector's court at Bonn. This visit was a memorable event in the\r\nlife of the Master, every detail of which was deeply etched upon his\r\nmemory, to be effaced only by death.\r\n\r\nIt was on this visit to Vienna that he met Mozart, and played for him.\r\nMozart gave due attention, and when the player had ceased he turned to\r\nthe company and said, \"Keep your eye on this youth--he will yet make a\r\nnoise in the world!\"\r\n\r\nThe remark, if closely analyzed, reveals itself as noncommittal; and\r\nalthough it has been bruited as praise the round world over, it was\r\nprobably an electrotyped expression, used daily; for great musicians are\r\ncalled upon at every turn to listen to prodigies. I once attended\r\n\"rhetoricals\" where the Honorable Chauncey M. Depew was present. Being\r\ncalled upon to \"make a few remarks,\" the Senator from New York arose and\r\nreferred to one of the speeches given by a certain sophomore as \"unlike\r\nanything I ever heard before!\" Genius very seldom recognizes genius.\r\n\r\nBeethoven had a self-sufficiency, even at that early time, that stood\r\nhim in good stead. He felt his power, and knew his worth. That\r\nsteadfast, obstinate quality in his make-up was not in vain. He let\r\nothers quote Mozart's remark; but he had matched himself against the\r\nMaster, and was not abashed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKinship is a question of spirit and not a matter of blood. How often do\r\nwe find persons who, in feeling, are absolutely strangers to their own\r\nbrothers and sisters! Occasionally even parents fail to understand their\r\nchildren. The child may hunger for sympathy and love that the mother\r\nknows nothing of, and cry itself to sleep for a tenderness withheld.\r\nLater this same child may evolve aspirations and ambitions that seem to\r\nthe other members of the family mere whims and vagaries to be laughed\r\ndown, or stoutly endured, as the mood prompts.\r\n\r\nKnowing these things, do we wonder at the question of long ago, \"Who is\r\nmy mother, and who are my brethren\"? Beethoven was a beautiful brown\r\nthrush in a nest of cuckoos. He could sing and sing divinely, and the\r\nmembers of his household were glad because it brought an income in which\r\nthey all shared.\r\n\r\nAbout the year Seventeen Hundred Ninety-five, Beethoven went to Vienna,\r\nand as he had been heralded by several persons of influence, his\r\nreception was gracious. Charity has its periods of evolving into a fad,\r\nand at this time the fashion was musical entertainments in aid of this\r\nor that. Slight suspicions exist that these numerous entertainments were\r\ndevised by fledgling musicians for their own aggrandizement, and\r\npossibly patrons fanned the philanthropic flame to help on their\r\nproteges. Beethoven was of too simple and guileless a nature to aid his\r\nfortunes with the help of any social jimmy, but we see he was soon in\r\nthe full tide of local popularity. His ability as a composer, his virile\r\npresence, and his skill as a player, made his company desired. From\r\nplaying first for charity, then at the houses of nobility, and next as a\r\nprofessional musician, he gradually mounted to the place to which his\r\ngenius entitled him.\r\n\r\nThen we find his brothers, Carl and Johann, appearing on the scene, with\r\na fussy yet earnest intent to take care of the business affairs of their\r\neccentric and absent-minded brother. Ludwig let himself fall into their\r\nway of thinking--it was easier than to oppose them--and they began to\r\ndrive bargains with publishers and managers. Their intent was to sell\r\nfor cash and in the highest market; and their strenuous effort after the\r\nMain Chance put their gifted brother in a bad plight before the world of\r\nart. Beethoven's brothers seized his very early and immature\r\ncompositions and sold them without his consent or knowledge. So\r\nhumiliated was Beethoven by seeing these productions of his childhood\r\nhawked about that he even instituted lawsuits to get them back that he\r\nmight destroy them. To boom a genius and cash his spiritual assets is a\r\ngrave and delicate task--perhaps it is one of those things that should\r\nbe left undone. Much anguish did these rapacious brothers cause the\r\ndivinely gifted brown thrush, and when they began to quarrel over the\r\nreceipts between themselves, he begged them to go away and leave him in\r\npeace. He finally had to adopt the ruse of going back to Bonn with\r\nthem, where he got them established in the apothecary business, before\r\nhe dared manage his own affairs. But they were bad angels, and the wind\r\nof their wings withered the great man as they hovered around him down to\r\nthe day of his death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen silence settled down upon Beethoven, and every piano was for him\r\nmute, and he, the maker of sweet sounds, could not hear his own voice,\r\nor catch the words that fell from the lips of those he loved, Fate\r\nseemed to have done her worst.\r\n\r\nAnd so he wrote: \"Forgive me then if you see me turn away when I would\r\ngladly mix with you. For me there is no recreation in human intercourse,\r\nno conversation, no sweet interchange of thought. In solitary exile I am\r\ncompelled to live. When I approach strangers a feverish fear takes\r\npossession of me, for I know that I will be misunderstood. * * * But O\r\nGod, Thou lookest down upon my inward soul! Thou knowest, and Thou seest\r\nthat love for my fellowmen, and all kindly feeling have their abode\r\nhere. Patience! I may get better--I may not--but I will endure all until\r\nDeath shall claim me, and then joyously will I go!\"\r\n\r\nThe man who could so express himself at twenty-eight years of age must\r\nhave been a right brave and manly man. But art was his solace, as it\r\nshould be to every soul that aspires to become.\r\n\r\nGreat genius and great love can never be separated--in fact I am not\r\nsure but that they are one and the same thing. But the object of his\r\nlove separated herself from Beethoven when calamity lowered. What woman,\r\nyoung, bright, vigorous and fresh, with her face to the sunrising, would\r\ncare to link her fair fate with that of a man sore-stricken by the hand\r\nof God!\r\n\r\nAnd then there is always a doubt about the genius--isn't he only a fool\r\nafter all!\r\n\r\nArt was Beethoven's solace. Art is harmony, beauty and excellence. The\r\nprovince of art is to impart a sublime emotion. Beethoven's heart was\r\nfilled with divine love--and all love is divine--and through his art he\r\nsought to express his love to others.\r\n\r\nBut his physical calamity made him the butt and byword of the heedless\r\nwherever he went. Within the sealed-up casements of his soul Beethoven\r\nheard the Heavenly Choir; and as he walked, bareheaded, upon the street,\r\noblivious to all, centered in his own silent world, he would sometimes\r\nsuddenly burst into song. At other times he would beat time, talk to\r\nhimself and laugh aloud. His strange actions would often attract a\r\ncrowd, and rude persons, ignorant of the man they mocked, would imitate\r\nhim or make mirth for the bystanders, as they sought to engage him in\r\nconversation. At such times the Master might be dragged back to earth,\r\nand seeing the coarse faces and knowing the hopelessness of trying to\r\nmake himself understood, he would retreat in terror.\r\n\r\nSix months or more of each year were spent in the country in some\r\nobscure village about Vienna. There he could walk the woods and traverse\r\nthe fields alone and unnoticed, and there, out under the open sky, much\r\nof his best work was done. The famous \"Moonlight Sonata\" was shaped on\r\none of these lonely walks by night across the fields when the Master\r\ncould shake his shaggy head, lift up his face to the sky, and cry aloud,\r\nall undisturbed. In the recesses of his imagination he saw the sounds.\r\nThere are men to whom sounds are invisible symbols of forms and colors.\r\n\r\nThe law of compensation never rests. Everything conspired to drive\r\nBeethoven in upon his art--it was his refuge and retreat. When love\r\nspurned him, and misunderstandings with kinsmen came, and lawsuits and\r\npoverty added their weight of woe, he fell back upon music, and out\r\nunder the stars he listened to the sonatas of God. Next day he wrote\r\nthem out as best he could, always regretting that his translations were\r\nnot quite perfect. He was ever stung with a noble discontent, and in\r\ntimes of exaltation there ran in his deaf ears the words, \"Arise and get\r\nthee hence, for this is not thy rest!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so his work was in a constant ascending scale. Richard Wagner has\r\nacknowledged his indebtedness to Beethoven in several essays, and in\r\nmany ways. In fact it is not too much to say that Beethoven was the\r\nspiritual parent of Wagner. From his admiration of Beethoven, Wagner\r\ndeveloped the strong, sturdy, independent quality of his nature that led\r\nto his exile--and his success.\r\n\r\nBehold the face of Ludwig Beethoven--is there not something Titanic\r\nabout it? What selfness, what will, what resolve, what power! And those\r\ntear-stained eyes--have they not seen sights of which no tongue can\r\ntell, nor tongue make plain?\r\n\r\nHis life of solitude helped foster the independence of his nature, and\r\nkept his mind clear and free from all the idle gossip of the rabble. He\r\nwent his way alone, and played court fool to no titled and alleged\r\nnobility. The democracy of the man is not our least excuse for honoring\r\nhim. He was one with the plain people of earth, and the only aristocracy\r\nhe acknowledged was the aristocracy of intellect.\r\n\r\nIn the work done after his fortieth year there is greater freedom, an\r\nease and an increased strength, with a daring quality which uplifts and\r\ngives you courage. The tragic interest and intense emotionalism are\r\ngone, and you behold a resignation and the success that wins by\r\nyielding. The man is no longer at war with destiny. There is no\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nWe pay for everything we receive--nay, all things can be obtained if we\r\nbut pay the price. One of the very few Emancipated Men in America bought\r\nredemption from the bondage of selfish ambition at a terrible price.\r\nYears and years ago he was in the Rocky Mountains, rough, uneducated,\r\nheedless of all that makes for righteousness. This man was caught in a\r\nsnowstorm, on the mountainside. He lost his way, became dazed with cold\r\nand fell exhausted in the snow. When found by his companions the next\r\nday, death had nearly claimed him. But skilful help brought him back to\r\nlife, yet the frost had killed the circulation in his feet. Both legs\r\nwere amputated just below the knees.\r\n\r\nThis changed the current of the man's life. Footraces, boxing-matches\r\nand hunting of big game were out of the question. The man turned to\r\nbooks and art and questions of science and sociology.\r\n\r\nThirty summers have come and gone. This gentle, sympathetic and loving\r\nman now walks with a cane, and few know of his disability and of his\r\nartificial feet. Speaking of his spiritual rebirth, this man of splendid\r\nintellect said to me, with a smile, \"It cost me my feet, but it was\r\nworth the price.\"\r\n\r\nI shed no maudlin tears over the misfortunes of Beethoven. He was what\r\nhe was because of what he endured. He grew strong by bearing burdens.\r\nAll things are equalized. By the Cross is the world redeemed. God be\r\npraised, it is all good!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE HANDEL]\r\n\r\nGEORGE HANDEL\r\n\r\n     When generations have been melted into tears, or raised to\r\n     religious fervor--when courses of sermons have been preached,\r\n     volumes of criticisms been written, and thousands of afflicted and\r\n     poor people supported by the oratorio of \"The Messiah\"--it becomes\r\n     exceedingly difficult to say anything new. Yet no notice of Handel,\r\n     however sketchy, should be written without some special tribute of\r\n     reverence to this sublime treatment of a sublime subject. Bach,\r\n     Graun, Beethoven, Spohr, Rossini and Mendelssohn have all composed\r\n     on the same theme. But no one in completeness, in range of effect,\r\n     in elevation and variety of conception, has ever approached\r\n     Handel's music upon this one subject.\r\n\r\n     --_Rev. H. R. Haweis_\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE HANDEL\r\n\r\n\"Did you meet Michelangelo while you were in Rome?\" asked a good Roycroft\r\ngirl of me the other day.\r\n\r\n\"No, my dear, no,\" I answered, and then I gulped hard to keep back some\r\nvery foolish tears. \"No, I did not meet Michelangelo,\" I said, \"I\r\nexpected to, and was always looking for him; but these eyes never looked\r\ninto his, for he died just three hundred years before I was born.\" But\r\nhow natural was this question from this bright, country girl! She had\r\nbeen examining a lot of photographs of the Sistine Chapel, and had seen\r\npictures of \"Il Penseroso,\" the \"Night\" and \"Morning,\" the \"Moses\"; and\r\nthen she had seen on my desk a bronze cast of the hand of the\r\n\"David\"--that imperial hand with the gently curved wrist.\r\n\r\nThese things lured her--the splendid strength and suggestion of power in\r\nit all, had caught her fancy, and the heroic spirit of the Master seemed\r\nvery near to her. It all meant pulsating life and hope that was\r\ndeathless; and the thought that the man who did the work had turned to\r\ndust three centuries ago, never occurred to this naive, budding soul.\r\n\r\n\"Did you see Michelangelo while you were in Rome?\" No, dear girl, no.\r\nBut I saw Saint Peter's that he planned, and I saw the result of his\r\nefforts--things worked out and materialized by his hands--hands that\r\nsurely were just like this hand of the \"David.\"\r\n\r\nThe artist gives us his best--gives it to us forever, for our very own.\r\nHe grows aweary and lies down to sleep--to sleep and wake no more,\r\ndeeding to us the mintage of his love. And as love does not grow old,\r\nneither does Art. Fashions change, but hope, aspiration and love are as\r\nold as Fate who sits and spins the web of life. The Artist is one who is\r\neducated in the three H's--head heart and hand. He is God's child--no\r\nless are we--and he has done for us the things we would have liked to do\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nThe classic is that which does not grow old--the classic is the\r\neternally true.\r\n\r\n\"Did you meet Michelangelo in Rome?\" Why, it is the most natural\r\nquestion in the world! At Stratford I expected to see Shakespeare; at\r\nWeimar I was sure to meet Goethe; Rubens just eluded me at Antwerp; at\r\nAmsterdam I caught a glimpse of Rembrandt; in the dim cloisters of Saint\r\nMark's at Florence I saw Savonarola in cowl and robe; over Whitehall in\r\nLondon I beheld the hovering smoke of martyr-fires, and knew that just\r\nbeyond the walls Ridley and Latimer were burned; and only a little way\r\noutside of Jerusalem a sign greets the disappointed traveler, thus: \"He\r\nis risen--He is not here!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn one of his delightful talks--talks that are as fine as his feats of\r\nleadership--Walter Damrosch has referred to Handel as a contemporary.\r\nSurely the expression is fitting, for in the realm of truth time is an\r\nillusion and the days are shadows.\r\n\r\nGeorge Frederick Handel was born in Sixteen Hundred Eighty-five, and\r\ndied in Seventeen Hundred Fifty-nine. His dust rests in Westminster\r\nAbbey, and above the tomb towers his form cut in enduring marble. There\r\nhe stands, serene and poised, accepting benignly the homage of the\r\nswift-passing generations. For over a hundred years this figure has\r\nstood there in its colossal calm, and through the cathedral shrines, the\r\naisles, and winding ways of dome and tower, Handel's music still peals\r\nits solemn harmonies.\r\n\r\nAt Exeter Hall is another statue of Handel, seated, holding in his hand\r\na lyre. At the Foundling Hospital (which he endowed) is a bust of the\r\nMaster, done in Seventeen Hundred Fifty-eight; and at Windsor is the\r\noriginal of still another bust that has served for a copy of the very\r\nmany casts in plaster and clay that are in all the shops.\r\n\r\nThere are at least fifty different pictures of Handel, and nearly this\r\nnumber were brought together, on the occasion of a recent Handel and\r\nHaydn Festival, at South Kensington.\r\n\r\nWhen Gladstone once referred to Handel as our greatest English\r\nComposer, he refused to take it back even when a capricious critic\r\ncarped and sneezed.\r\n\r\nHandel essentially belongs to England, for there his first battles were\r\nfought, and there he won his final victory. To be sure, he did some\r\npreliminary skirmishing in Germany and Italy; but that was only getting\r\nhis arms ready for that conflict which was to last for half a century--a\r\nconflict with friends, foes and fools.\r\n\r\nBut Handel was too big a man to be undermined by either the fulsome\r\nflattery of friends, or the malice of enemies, who were such only\r\nbecause they did not understand. And so always to the fore he marched,\r\nzigzagging occasionally, but the Voice said to him, as it did to\r\nColumbus, \"Sail on, and on, and on.\" Like the soul of John Brown, the\r\nspirit of Handel goes marching on. And Sir Arthur Sullivan was right\r\nwhen he said, \"Musical England owes more to Father Handel than to any\r\nother ten men who can be named--he led the way for us all, and cut out a\r\nscore that we can only imitate.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the Court of George of Brunswick, at Hanover, in Seventeen Hundred\r\nNine, was George Frederick Handel, six feet one, weight one hundred\r\neighty, rubicund, rosy, and full of romp, aged twenty-four. George of\r\nBrunswick was to have the felicity of being King George the First of\r\nEngland, and already he was straining his gaze across the Channel.\r\n\r\nAt his Court were divers and sundry English noblemen. Handel was a prime\r\nfavorite with every one in the merry company. The ladies doted on him. A\r\nfew gentlemen, possibly, were slightly jealous of his social prowess,\r\nand yet none pooh-poohed him openly, for only a short time before he had\r\nbroken a sword in a street duel with a brother musician, and once had\r\nthrown a basso profundo, who sang off key, through a closed window--all\r\nthis to the advantage of a passing glazier, who, being called in, was\r\npaid his fee three times over for repairing the sash. It's an ill wind,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nHandel played the harpsichord well, but the organ better. In fact, he\r\nplayed the organ in such a masterly way that he had no competitor, save\r\na phenomenal yokel by the name of Johann Sebastian Bach. These men were\r\nborn just a month apart. Saint Cecilia used to whisper to them when they\r\nwere wee babies. For several years they lived near each other, but in\r\nthis life they never met.\r\n\r\nHandel was an aristocrat by nature, even if not exactly so by birth,\r\nand so had nothing to do with the modest and bucolic Bach--even going so\r\nfar, they do say, as to leave, temporarily, the City of Halle, his\r\nnative place, when a contest was suggested between them. Bach was the\r\nsupreme culminating flower of two hundred fifty years of musical\r\nancestors--servants to this Grand Duke or that. But in the tribe of\r\nHandel there was not a single musical trace. George Frederick succeeded\r\nto the art, and at it, in spite of his parents. But never mind that! He\r\nhad been offered the post as successor to Buxtehude, and Buxtehude was\r\nthe greatest organist of his time. He accepted the invitation to play\r\nfor the Buxtehude contingent. A musical jury sat on the case, and\r\ndecided to accept the young man, with the proviso that Handel (taught by\r\nOrpheus) should take to wife the daughter of Buxtehude--this in order\r\nthat the traditions might be preserved.\r\n\r\nYoung Handel declined the proposition with thanks, declaring he was\r\nunworthy of the honor.\r\n\r\nYoung Handel had spent two years in Italy, had visited most of the\r\ncapitals of Europe, had composed several operas and numerous songs. He\r\nwas handsome, gracious and talented. Money may use its jimmy to break\r\ninto the Upper Circles; but to Beauty, Grace and Talent that does not\r\nshiver nor shrink, all doors fly open. And now the English noblemen\r\nrequested--nay, insisted--that Handel should accompany them back to\r\nMerry England.\r\n\r\nHe went, and being introduced as Signore Handello, he was received with\r\nsalvos of welcome. There is a time to plant, and a time to reap. There\r\nis a time for everything--launch your boat only at full of tide. London\r\nwas ripe for Italian Opera. Discovery had recently been made in England\r\nthat Art was born in Italy. It had traveled as far as Holland, and so\r\nDutch artists were hard at work in English manor-houses, painting\r\nportraits of ancestors, dead and living. Music, one branch of Art, had\r\nmade its way up to Germany, and here was an Italian who spoke English\r\nwith a German accent, or a German who spoke Italian--what boots it, he\r\nwas a great musician!\r\n\r\nHandel's Italian opera, \"Rinaldo,\" was given at a theater that stood on\r\nthe site of the present Haymarket. The production was an immense\r\nsuccess. All educated people knew Latin (or were supposed to know it),\r\nand Signore Handello announced that his Italian was an improvement on\r\nthe Latin. And so all the scholars flocked to see the play, and those\r\nwho were not educated came too, and looked knowing. In order to hold\r\ninterest, there were English syncopated songs between the acts--ragtime\r\nis a new word, but not a new thing.\r\n\r\nHandel was very wise in this world's affairs. He assured England that it\r\nwas the most artistic country on the globe. He wrote melodies that\r\neverybody could whistle. Airs from \"Rinaldo\" were thrummed on the\r\nharpsichord from Land's End to John O'Groat's. The grand march was\r\nadopted by the Life Guards, and at least one air from that far-off opera\r\nhas come down to us--the \"Tascie Ch'io Pianga,\" which is still listened\r\nto with emotion unfeigned. The opera being uncopyrighted, was published\r\nentire by an enterprising Englishman from Dublin by the name of Walsh.\r\nAt two o'clock one morning at the \"Turk's Head,\" he boasted he had\r\ncleared over two thousand pounds on the sale of it. Handel was present\r\nand responded, \"My friend, the next time you will please write the opera\r\nand I will sell it.\" Walsh took the hint, they say, and sent his check\r\non the morrow to the author for five hundred pounds. And the good sense\r\nof both parties is shown in the fact that they worked together for many\r\nyears, and both reaped a yellow harvest of golden guineas.\r\n\r\nOn the birthday of Queen Anne, Handel inscribed to her an ode, which we\r\nare told was played with a full band. The performance brought the\r\ndiplomatic Handel a pension of two hundred pounds a year.\r\n\r\nNext, to celebrate the peace of Utrecht, the famous \"Te Deum\" and\r\n\"Jubilate\" were produced, with a golden garter as a slight token of\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\nBut Good Queen Anne passed away, as even good queens do, and the\r\nfuzzy-witted George of Hanover came over to be King of England, and\r\ntransmit his fuzzy-wuzzy wit to all the Georges. About his first act was\r\nto cut off Handel's pension, \"Because,\" he said, \"Handel ran away from\r\nme at Hanover.\"\r\n\r\nA time of obscurity followed for Handel, but after some months, when the\r\nRoyal Barge went up the Thames, a band of one hundred pieces boomed\r\nalongside, playing a deafening racket, with horse-pistol accompaniments.\r\nThe King made inquiries and found it was \"Water-Music,\" composed by Herr\r\nHandel, and dedicated in loving homage to King George the First.\r\n\r\nWhen the Royal Barge came back down the river, Herr Handel was aboard,\r\nand accompanied by a great popping of corks was proclaimed Court\r\nMusician, and his back-pension ordered paid.\r\n\r\nThe low ebb of art is seen in that, in the various operas given about\r\nthis time by Handel, great stress is made in the bills about costumes,\r\nscenery and gorgeous stage-fittings. When accessories become more than\r\nthe play--illustrations more than the text--millinery more than the\r\nmind--it is unfailing proof that the age is frivolous. Art, like\r\ncommerce and everything else, obeys the law of periodicity. Handel saw\r\nthe tendency of the times, and advertised, \"The fountain to be seen in\r\n'Amadigi' is a genuine one, the pump real and the dog alive.\" Three\r\nhours before the doors opened, the throng stood in line, waiting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut London is making head. Other good men and true are coming to town.\r\nHandel does not know much about them, or care, perhaps. His wonderful\r\nenergy is now manifesting itself in the work of managing theaters and\r\nconcerts, giving lessons and composing songs, arias, operas, and\r\nattending receptions where \"the ladies refrain from hoops for fear of\r\nthe crush,\" to use the language of Samuel Pepys.\r\n\r\nIn shirt-sleeves, in a cheap seat in the pit, at one of Handel's\r\nperformances, is a big lout of a fellow, with scars of scrofula on his\r\nneck and cheek. Next to him is a little man, and these two, so chummy\r\nand confidential, suggest the long and short of it. They are countrymen,\r\nrecently arrived, empty of pocket, but full of hope. They have a selfish\r\neye on the stage, for the big 'un has written a play and wants to get it\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nThe little man's name is David Garrick; the other is Samuel Johnson.\r\n\r\nThey listen to the singing, and finally Samuel turns to his friend and\r\nsays, \"I say, Davy, music is nothing but a noise that is less\r\ndisagreeable than some others.\" They would go away, would these two, but\r\nthey have paid good money to get in, and so sit it out disgustedly,\r\nwatching the audience and the play alternately.\r\n\r\nIn one of the boxes is a weazened little man, all out of drawing, in a\r\nblack velvet doublet, satin breeches and silk stockings. At his side is\r\na rudimentary sword. The man's face is sallow, and shrewdness and\r\nselfishness are shown in every line. He looks like a baby suddenly grown\r\nold. The two friends in the pit have seen this man before, but they have\r\nnever met him face to face, because they do not belong to his set.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think God is proud of a work like that?\" at last asked Davy,\r\njerking his thumb toward the bad modeling in courtly black.\r\n\r\n\"God never made him.\" The big man swayed in his seat, and added, \"God\r\nhad nothing to do with him--he is the child of Beelzebub.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think 'ee so?\" asks Davy. \"Why, Mephisto has some pretty good traits;\r\nbut Alexander Pope is as crooked as an interrogation-point, inside and\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear he wears five pairs of stockings to fill out his shanks, and\r\nsole-leather stays to keep him from flattening out like a devilfish,\"\r\nsaid Doctor Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"But he makes a lot o' money!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he has to, for he pays an old woman a hundred guineas a year to\r\ndress and undress him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, but she writes his heroic couplets, too!\"\r\n\r\n\"Davy, I fear you are getting cynical--let's change the subject.\"\r\n\r\nIt surely is a case of artistic jealousy. Our friends locate the poet\r\nGay, a fat little man, who is with his publisher, Rich.\r\n\r\n\"They say,\" says Samuel, again rolling in his seat as if about to have\r\nan apoplectic fit, \"they say that Gay has become rich, and Rich has\r\nbecome gay since they got out that last book.\" There comes an interlude\r\nin the play, and our friends get up to stretch their legs.\r\n\r\n\"How now, Dick Savage?\" calls Samuel, as he pushes three men over like\r\nninepins, to seize a shabby fellow whose neckcloth and hair-cut betray\r\nhim as being a poet. \"How now, Dick, you said that Italian music was\r\ndamnably bad! Why do you come to hear it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I came to find out how bad it is,\" replied the literary man. \"Eh! your\r\nreverence?\" he adds to his companion, a sharp-nosed man with china-blue\r\neyes, in Church-of-England knee-breeches, high-cut vest, and shovel-hat.\r\n\r\nDean Swift replies with a knowing smirk, which is the nearest approach\r\nto a laugh in which he ever indulged. Then he takes out his snuffbox and\r\ntaps it, which is a sign that he is going to say something worth while.\r\n\"Yes, one must go everywhere, and do everything, just to find out how\r\nbad things are. By this means we clergymen are able to intelligently\r\nwarn our flocks. But I came tonight to hear that rogue Bononcini--you\r\nknow he is from County Down--I used to go to school with him,\" and the\r\nDean solemnly passes the snuffbox.\r\n\r\nGarrick here bursts into a laugh, which is broken off short by a\r\nreproving look from the Dean, who has gotten the snuffbox back and is\r\nmeditatively tapping it again. The friends listen and hear from the\r\nmuttering lips of the Dean, this:\r\n\r\n    Some say that Signore Bononcini,\r\n    Compared to Handel is a ninny;\r\n    Whilst others vow that to him Handel,\r\n    Is hardly fit to hold a candle.\r\n    Strange all this difference should be\r\n    'Twixt tweedledum and tweedledee.\r\n\r\nThe people are tumbling back to their seats as the musicians come\r\nstringing in. Soon there is a general tuning up--scrapings, toots,\r\nsnorts, subdued screeches, raspings, and all that busy buzz-fuzz\r\nbusiness of getting ready to play.\r\n\r\n\"The first time we came to the opera Doctor Johnson thought this was all\r\na part of the play, and applauded with unction for an encore,\" says\r\nGarrick.\r\n\r\n\"And I heard nothing finer the whole evening,\" answers Doctor Johnson,\r\naccepting the defi, and winning by yielding.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't they tune up at home, or behind the scenes?\" asks some one.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you why,\" says Savage, and he relates this: \"Handel is a\r\ngreat man for system--he is a strict disciplinarian, as any man must be\r\nto manage musicians, who are neither men nor women, but a third sex.\r\nOften Handel has to knock their heads together, and once he shook the\r\nCuzzoni until her teeth chattered.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the way you have to treat any woman before she will respect\r\nyou,\" interrupts the Dean. Nothing else being forthcoming, Savage\r\ncontinues: \"Handel is absolute master of everything but Death and\r\nDestiny. Now he didn't like all this tuning up before the audience; he\r\nsaid you might as well expect the prima donna to make her toilet in\r\nfront of the curtain\"--\r\n\r\n\"I like the idea,\" says Johnson.\r\n\r\nSavage praises the interruption and continues: \"And so ordered every man\r\nto tune up his artillery a half-hour before the performance, and carry\r\nhis instrument in and lay it on his chair. Then when it came time to\r\ncommence, every musician would walk in, take up his instrument, and\r\nbegin. The order was given, and all tuned up. Then the players all\r\nadjourned for their refreshments.\r\n\r\n\"In the interval a wag entered and threw every instrument out of key.\r\n\r\n\"It came time to begin--the players marched in like soldiers. Handel was\r\nin his place. He rapped once--every player seized his instrument as\r\nthough it were a musket. At the second rap the music began--and such\r\nmusic! Some of the strings were drawn so tight that they snapped at the\r\nfirst touch; others merely flapped; some growled; and others groaned and\r\nmoaned or squealed. Handel thought the orchestra was just playing him a\r\nscurvy trick. He leaped upon the stage, kicked a hole in the bass-viol,\r\nand smashed the kettledrum around the neck of the nearest performer. The\r\nplayers fled before the assault, and he bombarded them with cornets and\r\nFrench horns as they tumbled down the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"The audience roared with delight, and not one in forty guessed that it\r\nwas not a specially arranged Italian feature. But since that evening all\r\ntuning-up is done on the stage, and no man lets his instrument get out\r\nof his hands after he gets it right.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a moving tale, invented as an excuse for a man who writes music so\r\nbad that he gets disgusted with it himself, and flies into wrath when he\r\nhears it,\" says Johnson.\r\n\r\nA subdued buzz is heard, and the master comes forth, gorgeous in a suit\r\nof purple velvet. His powdered wig and the enormous silver buckles on\r\nhis shoes set off his figure with the proper accent. His florid face is\r\nsmiling, and Garrick expresses a regret that there are to be no\r\nimpromptu tragic events in way of chasing players from the stage.\r\n\r\n\"Would you like to meet him?\" asks the sharp-nosed Dean.\r\n\r\nGarrick and Johnson have enough of the rustic in them to be\r\nlion-hunters, and they reply to the question as one man, \"Yes, indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll arrange it,\" was the answer. The leader raps for attention.\r\nJohnson closes his eyes, sighs, and leans back resignedly.\r\n\r\nThe others look and listen with interest as the play proceeds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe other day I read a book by Madame Columbier entitled, \"Sara Barnum.\"\r\nOnly a person of worth could draw forth such a fire of hot invective,\r\nbiting sarcasm and frenzied vituperation as this volume contains. When I\r\nclosed the volume it was with the feeling that Sara Bernhardt is surely\r\nthe greatest woman of the age; and I was fully resolved that I must see\r\nher play at the first opportunity, no matter what the cost. And as for\r\nMadame Columbier, why she isn't so bad, either! The flashes of lightning\r\nin her swordplay are highly interesting. The book was born, as all good\r\nbooks, because its mother could not help it. Behind every page and\r\nbetween the lines you see the fevered toss of human emotion and hot\r\nambition--these women were rivals. There were digs and scratches,\r\nbandied epithets in falsetto, and sounds like a piccolo played by a man\r\nin distress, before all this; and these are not explained, so you have\r\nto fill them in with your imagination. But the Bernhardt is the bigger\r\nwoman of the two. She goes her splendid pace alone, and all the other\r\nwoman can do is to bombard her with a book.\r\n\r\nThe excellence of Handel is shown in that he achieved the enmity of some\r\nvery good men. Read the \"Spectator,\" and you will find its pages well\r\npeppered with thrusts at \"foreigners,\" and sweeping cross-strokes at\r\nItalian Opera and all \"bombastic beaters of the air, who smother harmony\r\nwith bursts of discord in the name of music.\"\r\n\r\nThese battles royal between the kings of art are not so far removed from\r\nthe battles of the beasts. Rosa Bonheur has pictured a duel to the death\r\nbetween stallions; and that battle of the stags--horn-locked--with the\r\nmorning sun revealing Death as victor, by Landseer, is familiar to us\r\nall. Then Landseer has another picture which he called \"The Monarch,\"\r\nshowing a splendid stag, solitary and alone, standing on a cliff,\r\noverlooking the valley. There is history behind this stag. Before he\r\ncould command the scene alone, he had to vanquish foes; but in the main,\r\nin some way, you feel that most of his battles have been bloodless and\r\nhe commands by divine right. The Divine Right of a King, if he be a\r\nKing, has its root in truth.\r\n\r\nOne mark of the genius of Handel is shown in the fact that he has\r\nachieved a split and created a ruction in the Society of Scribblers. He\r\nonce cut Dean Swift dead at a fashionable gathering--the doughty Dean,\r\nwho delighted in making men and women alike crawl to him--and this won\r\nhim the admiration of Colley Cibber, who immortalized the scene in a\r\nsonnet. People liked Handel, or they did not, and among the Old Guard\r\nwho stood by him, let these names, among others, be remembered: Colley\r\nCibber, Gay, Arbuthnot, Pope, Hogarth, Fielding and Smollett.\r\n\r\nPeople who through incapacity are unable to comprehend or appreciate\r\nmusic, are prone to wax facetious over it--the feeble joke is the last\r\nresort of the man who does not understand.\r\n\r\nThe noisy denizens of Grub Street, drinking perdition to that which they\r\ncan not comprehend, always getting ready to do great things, seem like\r\nfussy pigmies beside a giant like Handel. See the fifth act ere the\r\ncurtain falls on the lives of Oliver Goldsmith, Doctor Johnson, Steele,\r\nAddison and Dean Swift (dead at the top, the last), and the others\r\nunhappily sent into Night; and then behold George Frederick Handel, in\r\nhis seventy-fifth year, blind, but with inward vision all aflame,\r\nconducting the oratorio of \"Elijah\" before an audience of five thousand\r\npeople!\r\n\r\nThe life of Handel was packed with work and projects too vast for one\r\nman to realize. That he deferred to the London populace and wrote down\r\nto them at first, is true; but the greatness of the man is seen in\r\nthis--he never deceived himself. He knew just what he was doing, and in\r\nhis heart was ever a shrine to the Ideal, and upon this altar the fires\r\nnever died.\r\n\r\nHandel was a man of affairs as well as a musician, and if he had loved\r\nmoney more than Art, he could have withdrawn from the fray at thirty\r\nyears of age, passing rich.\r\n\r\nThree times in his life he risked all in the production of Grand Opera,\r\nand once saw a sum equal to fifty thousand dollars disappear in a week,\r\nthrough the treachery of Italian artists who were pledged to help him.\r\nAt great expense and trouble he had gone abroad and searched Europe for\r\ntalent, and, regardless of outlay, had brought singers and performers\r\nacross the sea to England. In several notable instances these singers\r\nhad, in a short time, been bought up by rivals, and had turned upon\r\ntheir benefactor.\r\n\r\nBut Handel was not crushed by these things. He was philosopher enough to\r\nknow that ingratitude is often the portion of the man who does well, and\r\na fight with a fox you have warmed into life is ever imminent. At\r\nfifty-five, a bankrupt, he makes terms with his creditors and in a few\r\nyears pays off every shilling with interest, and celebrates the event by\r\nthe production of \"Saul,\" the \"Dead March\" from which will never die.\r\n\r\nThe man had been gaining ground, making head, and at the same time\r\neducating the taste of the English people. But still they lagged behind,\r\nand when the oratorio of \"Joshua\" was performed, the Master decided he\r\nwould present his next and best piece outside of England. Jealousy, a\r\ndangerous weapon, has its use in the diplomatic world.\r\n\r\nHandel set out for Dublin with a hundred musicians, there to present the\r\n\"Messiah,\" written for and dedicated to the Irish people. The oratorio\r\nhad been turned off in just twenty-one days, in one of those titanic\r\nbursts of power, of which this man was capable. Its production was a\r\nfeat worthy of the Frohmans at their best. The performance was to be for\r\ncharity--to give freedom to those languishing in debtors' prisons at\r\nDublin. What finer than that the \"Messiah\" should give deliverance?\r\n\r\nThe Irish heart was touched. A fierce scramble ensued for seats,\r\nprecedence being emphasized in several cases with blackthorns deftly\r\nwielded. The price of seats was a guinea each. Handel's carriage was\r\ndrawn through the streets by two hundred students. He was crowned with\r\nshamrock, and given the freedom of the city in a gold box. Freedom even\r\nthen, in Ireland, was a word to conjure with. Long before the\r\nperformance, notices that no more tickets would be sold were posted. The\r\ndoors of the Debtors' Prison were thrown open, and the prisoners given\r\nseats so they could hear the music--thus overdoing the matter in true\r\nIrish style.\r\n\r\nThe performance was the supreme crowning event in the life of Handel up\r\nto that time.\r\n\r\nCouriers were dispatched to London to convey the news of Handel's great\r\ntriumph to the newspapers; bulletins were posted at the clubs--the\r\ninfection caught! On the return of the master a welcome was given him\r\nsuch as he had never before known--Dublin should not outdo London! When\r\nthe \"Messiah\" was given in London, the scene of furore in Dublin was\r\nrepeated. The wild tumult at times drowned the orchestra, and when the\r\n\"Hallelujah Chorus\" was sung, the audience arose as one man and joined\r\nin the song of praise. And from that day the custom has continued:\r\nwhenever in England the \"Messiah\" is given, the audience arises and\r\nsings in the \"Chorus,\" as its privilege and right. The proceeds of the\r\nfirst performance of the \"Messiah\" in England were given to charity, as\r\nin Dublin. This act, with the splendor of the work, subdued the last\r\nlingering touch of obdurate criticism. The man was canonized by popular\r\nacclaim. Many of his concerts were now for charity--\"The Foundlings'\r\nHome,\" \"The Seamen's Fund,\" \"Home for the Aged,\" hospitals and\r\nimprisoned debtors--all came in for their share.\r\n\r\nHandel never married. That remark of Dean Swift's, \"I admire\r\nHandel--principally because he conceals his petticoat peccadilloes with\r\nsuch perfection,\" does not go. Handel considered himself a priest of\r\nart, and his passion spent itself in his work.\r\n\r\nThe closing years of his life were a time of peace and honor. His bark,\r\nafter a fitful voyage, had glided into safe and peaceful waters. The\r\ncalamity of blindness did not much depress him--\"What matters it so long\r\nas I can hear?\" he said. And good it is to know that the capacity to\r\nlisten and enjoy, to think and feel, to sympathize and love--to live his\r\nIdeals--were his, even to the night of his passing Hence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIUSEPPE VERDI]\r\n\r\nGIUSEPPE VERDI\r\n\r\n\r\n     Of all the operas that Verdi wrote,\r\n       The best, to my taste, is the Trovatore;\r\n     And Mario can soothe, with a tenor note,\r\n       The souls in purgatory.\r\n\r\n     The moon on the tower slept soft as snow;\r\n       And who was not thrilled in the strangest way,\r\n     As we heard him sing while the lights burned low,\r\n       \"Non ti scordar di me\"?\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     But O, the smell of that jasmine-flower!\r\n       And O, the music! and O, the way\r\n     That voice rang out from the donjon tower,\r\n      \"Non ti scordar di me,\r\n       Non ti scordar di me!\"\r\n\r\n     --_Bulwer-Lytton_\r\n\r\n\r\nGIUSEPPE VERDI\r\n\r\nHe sort of clung to the iron pickets, did the boy, and pressed his face\r\nthrough the fence and listened. Some one was playing the piano in the\r\nbig house, and the windows with their little diamond panes were flung\r\nopen to catch the evening breeze. He listened.\r\n\r\nHis big gray eyes were open wide, the pupils dilated--he was trying to\r\nsee the music as well as hear it.\r\n\r\nThe boy's hair matched the yellow of his face, being one shade lighter,\r\nsun-bleached from going hatless. His clothes were as yellow as the\r\nyellow of his face, and shaded off into the dust that strewed the\r\nstreet. He was like a quail in a stubble-field--you might have stepped\r\nover him and never seen him at all. He listened. Almost every evening\r\nsome one played the piano in the big house. He had discovered the fact a\r\nweek before, and now, when the dusk was gathering, he would watch his\r\nchance and slide away from the hut where his parents lived, and run fast\r\nup the hill, and along the shelving roadway to the tall iron fence that\r\nmarked the residence of Signore Barezzi. He would creep along under the\r\nstone wall, and crouching there would wait and listen for the music.\r\nSeveral evenings he had come and waited, and waited, and waited--and not\r\na note or a voice did he hear.\r\n\r\nOnce it had rained and he didn't mind it much, for he expected every\r\nmoment the music would strike up, you know--and who cares for cold, or\r\nwet, or even hunger, if one can hear good music! The air grew chill and\r\nthe boy's threadbare jacket stuck to his bony form like a postage-stamp\r\nto a letter. Little rivulets of water ran down his hair and streamed off\r\nhis nose and cheeks. He waited--he was waiting for the music.\r\n\r\nHe might have waited until the water dissolved his insignificant cosmos\r\ninto just plain, yellow mud, and then he would have been simply\r\ndistributed all along the gutter down to the stream, and down the stream\r\nto the river, and down the river to the ocean; and no one would ever\r\nhave heard of him again.\r\n\r\nBut Signore Barezzi's coachman came along that night, keeping close to\r\nthe fence under the trees to avoid the wet; and the coachman fell over\r\nthe boy.\r\n\r\nNow, when we fall over anything we always want to kick it--no matter\r\nwhat it is, be it cat, dog, stump, stick, stone or human. The coachman\r\nbeing but clay (undissolved) turned and kicked the boy. Then he seized\r\nhim by the collar, and accused him of being a thief. The lad\r\nacknowledged the indictment, and stammeringly tried to explain that it\r\nwas only music he was trying to steal; and that it really made no\r\ndifference because even if one did fill himself full of the music, there\r\nwas just as much left for other people, since music was different from\r\nmost things.\r\n\r\nThe thought was not very well expressed, although the idea was all\r\nright, but the coachman failed to grasp it. So he tingled the boy's bare\r\nlegs with the whip he carried, by way of answer, duly cautioning him\r\nnever to let it occur again, and released the prisoner on parole.\r\n\r\nBut the boy forgot and came back the next night. He sat on the ground\r\nbelow the wall, intending to keep out of sight; but when the music began\r\nhe stood up, and now, with face pressed between the pickets, he\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\nThe wind sighed softly through the orange-trees; the air was heavy with\r\nthe perfume of flowers; the low of cattle came from across the valley,\r\nand on the evening breeze from an open casement rose the strong,\r\nvibrant, yet tender, strains of Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata.\" The lad\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\n\"Do you like music?\" came a voice from behind. The boy awoke with a\r\nstart, and tried to butt his head through the pickets to escape in that\r\ndirection. He thought it was the coachman. He turned and saw the kindly\r\nface of Signore Barezzi himself.\r\n\r\n\"Do I like music? Me! No, I mean yes, when it is like that!\" he\r\nexclaimed, beginning his reply with a tremolo and finishing bravura.\r\n\r\n\"That is my daughter playing; come inside with me.\" The hand of the\r\ngreat man reached out, and the urchin clutched at it as if it were\r\nsomething he had been longing for.\r\n\r\nThey walked through the big gates where a stone lion kept guard on each\r\nside. The lions never moved. They walked up the steps, and entering the\r\nparlor saw a young woman seated at the piano.\r\n\r\n\"Grazia, dear, here is the little boy we saw the other day--you\r\nremember? I thought I would bring him in.\" The young woman came forward\r\nand touched the lad on his tawny head with one of her beautiful\r\nhands--the beautiful hands that had just been playing the \"Sonata.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, little boy, we have seen you outside there before, and if\r\nI had known you were there tonight, I would have gone out and brought\r\nyou in; but Papa has done the service for me. Now, you must sit down\r\nright over there where I can see you, and I will play for you. But won't\r\nyou tell us your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me?\" replied the little boy, \"why--why my name is Giuseppe Verdi--I am\r\nten years old now--going on 'leven--you see, I like to hear you play\r\nbecause I play myself, a little bit!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor over a hundred years three-fourths of Italy's population had been on\r\nreduced rations. Starvation even yet crouches just around the corner.\r\n\r\nIn his childhood young Verdi used to wear a bit of rope for a girdle,\r\nand when hunger gnawed importunately, he would simply pull his belt one\r\nknot tighter, and pray that the ravens would come and treat him as well\r\nas they did Elijah. His parents were so poor that the question of\r\neducation never came to them; but desire has its way, so we find the boy\r\nat ten years of age running errands for a grocer with a musical\r\nattachment. This grocer, at Busseto, Jasquith by name, hung upon the\r\nfringe of art, and made the dire mistake of mixing business with his\r\nfad, for he sold his wares to sundry gentlemen who played in bands. This\r\nled the good man to moralize at times, and he would say to Giuseppe, who\r\nhad been promoted from errand-boy to clerk: \"You can trust a first\r\nviolin, and a 'cello usually pays, but never say yes to a trombone nor\r\nan oboe; and as for a kettle-drum, I wouldn't believe one on a stack of\r\nBibles!\"\r\n\r\nOver the grocer's shop was a little parlor, and in it was a spinet that\r\nyoung Giuseppe had the use of four evenings a week. In his later years\r\nVerdi used to tell of this, and once said that the idea of prohibition\r\nand limit should be put on every piano--then the pupil would make the\r\nbest of his privileges. In those days there was a tax on spinets, and I\r\nbelieve that this tax has never been rescinded, for you are taxed if\r\nyou keep a piano, now, in any part of Italy. Several times the poor\r\ngrocer's spinet stood in sore peril from the publicans and sinners, but\r\nthe bailiffs were bought off by Signore Barezzi, who came to the rescue.\r\n\r\nThe note of thrift was even then in Verdi's score, for he himself has\r\ntold how he induced the Barezzi household to patronize the honest grocer\r\nwith musical proclivities.\r\n\r\nWhen twelve years of age Verdi occasionally played the organ in the\r\nvillage church at Busseto. It will be seen from this that he had\r\ncourage, and even then possessed a trace of that pride and self-will\r\nthat was to be his disadvantage and then his blessing. Signore Barezzi's\r\nattachment to the boy was very great, and we find the youngster was on\r\nfriendly terms with the family, having free use of their piano, with\r\nvaluable help and instruction from Signorina Grazia. When he was\r\nseventeen he was easily the first musician in the place, and Busseto had\r\nnothing more to offer in the way of advantages. He thirsted for a wider\r\ncareer, and cast longing looks out into the great outside world. He had\r\nplayed at Parma, only a few miles away, and the Bishop there, after\r\nhearing him improvise on the organ, had paid him a doubtful compliment\r\nby saying, \"Your playing is surely unlike anything ever before heard in\r\nParma.\" Fair fortune smiled when Signore Barezzi secured for young Verdi\r\na free scholarship at the Conservatory at Milan.\r\n\r\nThe youth went gaily forth, attended by the blessings of the whole\r\nvillage, to claim his honors.\r\n\r\nArriving at the Conservatory, the directors put him through his paces,\r\nafter the usual custom, to prove his fitness for the honor that had been\r\nthrust upon him. He played first upon the piano, and the committee\r\nadvised together in whispered monotone. Then they asked him to play on\r\nthe organ, and there was more consultation, with argument which was\r\npunctuated by rolling adjectives and many picturesque gesticulations.\r\nThen they asked him to play the piano again. He did so, and the great\r\nmen retired to deliberate and vote on the issue.\r\n\r\nTheir decision was that the youth was self-willed, erratic, and that he\r\nhad some absurd mannerisms and tricks of performance that forbade his\r\never making a musician. And therefore, they ruled that his admission to\r\nthe Conservatory was impossible.\r\n\r\nBarezzi, who was present with his protege, stormed in wrath, and\r\ndeclared that Verdi was the peer of any of his judges; in fact, was so\r\nmuch beyond them that they could not comprehend him.\r\n\r\nThis only confirmed the powers in the stand they had taken, and they\r\nintimated that a great musician in Busseto was something different in\r\nMilan--Signore Barezzi had better take his young man home and be content\r\nto astonish the villagers with noisy acrobatics. There being nothing\r\nelse to do, the advice was first flouted and then followed. They\r\narrived home, and Grazia and the grocer were informed that the\r\nConservatory at Milan was a delusion and a snare--\"a place where pebbles\r\nwere polished and diamonds were dimmed.\" Shortly after, the townspeople,\r\nto show faith in the home product, had Verdi duly installed as organist\r\nof the village church at a salary equal to forty dollars a year.\r\n\r\nUnder the spell of this good fortune, Verdi proposed marriage to the\r\ndaughter of Jasquith, the grocer, his friend and benefactor. Gratitude\r\nto the man who had first assisted him had much to do with the alliance;\r\nand in wedding the daughter, Verdi simply complied with what he knew to\r\nbe the one ardent desire of the father.\r\n\r\nThe girl was a frail creature, of fine instincts, but her intellect had\r\nbeen starved just as her body had been. Her chief virtue seems to have\r\nbeen that she believed absolutely in the genius of Verdi.\r\n\r\nThe ambition of Verdi began to show itself. He wrote an opera, and\r\noffered it to Merelli, the impresario of \"La Scala\" at Milan. The\r\nimpresario had heard of Verdi, through the fact that the Conservatory\r\nhad blackballed him. This of itself would have been no passport to fame,\r\nbut the Committee saw fit to defend themselves in the matter by making a\r\npublic report of the considerations which had moved them to shut the\r\ndoors on the young man from Busseto. This gave the subject a weight and\r\nprominence that simple admission never would have given.\r\n\r\nMerelli, the Major Pond of Milan, saw the expressions \"bizarre,\"\r\n\"erratic,\" \"peculiar,\" \"unprecedented,\" and kept his eye on Verdi. And\r\nso when the opera was written he pounced upon it, thinking possibly a\r\nnew star had appeared on the horizon. The opera was accepted. Verdi,\r\nfeverish with hope, moved his scanty effects to Milan, and there, with\r\nhis frail and beautiful girl-wife and their baby-boy, lived in a garret\r\njust across from the theater.\r\n\r\nPreparations for the performance were going on apace. The night of\r\nNovember Seventeenth, Eighteen Hundred Thirty-nine came, and the play\r\nwas presented. The critics voted it a failure. Merelli, the manager, saw\r\nthat it was not strong enough with which to storm the town, and so\r\ndecided to abandon it. He liked the young composer, though, and admired\r\nhis work; and inasmuch as he had brought him to Milan, he felt a sort of\r\nobligation to help him along. So Verdi was given an order for an opera\r\nbouffe. That's it! Opera bouffe!--the people want comedy--they must be\r\namused. Even Verdi's serious work ran dangerously close to farce--bouffe\r\nis the thing!\r\n\r\nMerelli's hope was infectious. Verdi began work on the new play that was\r\nto be presented in the Spring. The winter rains began. There was no fire\r\nin the garret where the composer and his frail girl-wife lived. They\r\nwere so proud that they did not let the folks at Busseto know where they\r\nwere: even Merelli did not know their place of abode. Under an assumed\r\nname Verdi got occasional work as an underling in one of the theaters,\r\nand also played the piano at a restaurant. The wages thus earned were a\r\npittance, but he managed to take home soup-bones that the baby-boy\r\nsucked on as though they were nectar.\r\n\r\nAnother baby was born that winter. The mother was unattended, save by\r\nher husband--no other woman was near. Verdi managed to bring home scraps\r\nof food by stealth from the restaurant where he played, but it was not\r\nthe kind that was needed. There was no money to buy goat's milk for the\r\nnew-born babe, and the famishing mother, ever hopeful, assured the\r\nhusband it wasn't necessary--that the babe was doing well. The child\r\ngrew aweary of this world before a month had passed, and slept to wake\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nBut the opera bouffe was taking shape. It was rehearsed and hummed by\r\nhusband and wife together. They went over it all again and again, and\r\nstruck out and added to. It was splendid work--subtle, excruciatingly\r\nfunny, and possessed a dash and go that would sweep all carping and\r\ncriticism before it.\r\n\r\nFood was still scarce, and there was no fuel even to cook things; but as\r\nthere was nothing to cook, it really made no difference. Spring was\r\ncoming--it was cold, to be sure, but the buds were swelling on the trees\r\nin the park. Verdi had seen them with his own eyes, and he hastened home\r\nto tell his wife--Spring was coming!\r\n\r\nThe two-year-old boy didn't seem to thrive on soup-bones. The father\r\nused to hold him in his arms at night to warm the little form against\r\nhis own body. He awoke one morning to find the child cold and stiff. The\r\nboy was dead.\r\n\r\nThe mother used to lie abed all day now. She wasn't ill she said--just\r\ntired! She never looked so beautiful to her husband. Two bright pink\r\nspots marked her cheeks, and set off the alabaster of her complexion.\r\nHer eyes glowed with such a light as Verdi had never before seen. No,\r\nshe was not ill--she protested this again and again. She kept to her bed\r\nmerely to be warm; and then if one didn't move around much, less food\r\nwas required--don't you see?\r\n\r\nSpring had come. The opera was being rehearsed. The title of the play\r\nwas \"Un Giorno di Regno.\" Merelli said he thought it would be a success;\r\nVerdi was sure of it.\r\n\r\nThe night of presentation came. After the first act Verdi ran across the\r\nstreet, leaped up the stairs three steps at a time, and reached the\r\ngarret. The play was a success. The worn woman there on her pallet, the\r\npale moonlight streaming in on her face, knew it would be. She raised\r\nherself on her elbow and tried to call, \"Viva Verdi!\" But the cough cut\r\nher words short. Verdi kissed her forehead, her hands, her hair, and\r\nhurried back in time to see the curtain ascend on the second act. This\r\nact went without either applause or disapproval. Verdi ran home to say\r\nthat the audience was a trifle critical, but the play was all right--it\r\nwas a success! He said he would remain at home now, he would not go to\r\nhear the third and last act. He would attend his wife until she got well\r\nand strong. The play was a success!\r\n\r\nShe prevailed upon him to leave her and then come back at the finale and\r\ntell her all about it.\r\n\r\nHe went away.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned he stumbled up the stairway and slowly entered the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe last act had not been completed--the audience had hissed the players\r\nfrom the stage!\r\n\r\nUpon the ashen face of her husband, the stricken woman read all. She\r\ntried to smile. She reached out one thin hand on which loosely hung a\r\nmarriage-ring. The hand dropped before he could reach it. The eyes of\r\nthe woman were closed, but upon the long, black lashes glistened two big\r\ntears. The spirit was brave, but the body had given up the great\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe calamities that had come sweeping over Verdi well-nigh broke his\r\nproud heart. He was only twenty-six, but he had had a taste of life and\r\nfound it bitter.\r\n\r\nHe lost interest in everything. All his musical studies were abandoned,\r\nhis excursions into science went by default, and he was quite content to\r\nbang the piano in a concert saloon for enough to secure the bare\r\nnecessaries of life. Suicide seemed to present the best method of\r\nsolving the problem, and the various ways of shuffling off this mortal\r\ncoil were duly considered. Meanwhile he filled in the time reading\r\ntrashy novels--anything to forget time and place, and lose self in\r\npoppy-dreams of nothingness.\r\n\r\nTwo years of such blankness and blackness followed. He was sure that the\r\ndesire to create, to be, to do, would never come again--these were all\r\nof the past. One day on an idle stroll through the park he met Merelli.\r\nAs they walked along together, Merelli took from his pocket a book, the\r\nstory of \"Nabucco,\" and handing it to Verdi, asked him to look it over,\r\nand see if he thought there was a chance to make an opera out of it.\r\nVerdi responded that he was not in the business of writing operas--he\r\nhad quit all such follies. He took the volume, however, but neglected to\r\nlook at it for several days. At last he read the pages. He laid the book\r\ndown and began to pace the floor. Possibilities of creation were looming\r\nlarge before him--a rush of thought was upon him. His soul was not\r\ndead--it had only been lying fallow.\r\n\r\nHe secured the loan of a piano and set to work. In a month the opera was\r\ncompleted. Merelli hesitated about accepting it--twice he had lost money\r\non Verdi. Finally he decided he would put the play on, if Verdi would\r\nwaive all royalties for the first three performances, if it were a\r\nsuccess, and then sell the opera outright \"at a reasonable price,\" if\r\nMerelli should chance to want it. The \"reasonable price\" was assumed to\r\nbe about a thousand francs--two hundred dollars--pretty good pay for a\r\nmonth's work.\r\n\r\nVerdi took no interest in the production of the piece. He had come to\r\nthe conclusion that the public was a fickle, foolish thing, and no one\r\ncould tell what it would hiss or applaud. Then he remembered the\r\nblackness of the night when only two years before his other opera was\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nHe made his way to his dingy little room and went to bed.\r\n\r\nVery early the next morning there was a loud pounding on his door. It\r\nwas Merelli. \"How much for your opera?\" asked the impresario, pushing\r\nhis way into the room.\r\n\r\n\"Thirty thousand francs,\" came a voice, loud and clear out of the\r\nbedclothes.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a fool,\" returned Merelli--\"why do you ask such a sum!\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you are here at five o'clock in the morning--the price will be\r\nfifty thousand this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nTen minutes of parley followed, and then Merelli drew his check for\r\ntwenty thousand francs, and Verdi gave his quitclaim, turned over in\r\nbed, and went to sleep again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe success of \"Nabucodonosor\" was complete. Its author had his twenty\r\nthousand francs, but Merelli made more than that. From Eighteen Hundred\r\nForty-two to Eighteen Hundred Fifty-one may be called the First Verdi\r\nPeriod. A dozen successful operas were produced, and simultaneously at\r\nRome, Naples, Venice, Milan, Genoa and Florence, Verdi's compositions\r\nwere being presented. The master was a businessman, as well as an\r\nartist--the combination is not so unusual as was long believed--and knew\r\nhow to get the most for the mintage of his mind. Money fairly flowed his\r\nway.\r\n\r\nVerdi married again in Eighteen Hundred Fifty. His life now turns into\r\nwhat may be called the Second Verdi Period. After this we shall see no\r\nmore such curious exhibitions of bad taste as a ballet of forty witches\r\nin \"Macbeth,\" capering nimbly to a syncopated melody, with \"Lady\r\nMacbeth\" in a needlessly abbreviated skirt singing a drinking-song to an\r\nabsent lover. In strenuous efforts to avoid coarseness Verdi may\r\noccasionally give us soft sentimentality, but the change is for the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nHis mate was a woman of mind as well as heart. She was his intellectual\r\ncompanion, his friend, his wife. For nearly fifty years they lived\r\ntogether. Her dust now lies in the \"House of Rest,\" at Milan, a home for\r\naged artists, founded by Verdi. This \"House of Rest\" was a\r\nLove-Offering, dedicated to the woman who had given him, without stint,\r\nof the richness of her nature; who had bestowed rest, and peace, and\r\nhope and gentle love. She had no feverish ambitions and petty plans and\r\nschemes for secretly corralling pleasure, power, place, attention, or\r\nselfish admiration. By giving all, she won all. She devoted herself to\r\nthis man in whom she had perfect faith, and he had perfect faith in her.\r\nShe ministered to him. They grew great together. When each was over\r\neighty years of age, Henry James met them at Cremona, at a musical\r\nfestival in honor of the birthday of Stradivari. And thus wrote Henry\r\nJames: \"Verdi and his wife were there, admired above all others. And why\r\nnot? Think of whom they are, and what they stand for--nearly a century\r\nof music, and a century of life! The master is tall, straight, proud,\r\ncommanding. He has a courtly old-time grace of bearing; and he kissed\r\nhis wife's hand when he took leave of her for an hour's stroll. And the\r\nMadame surely is not old in spirit; she is as sprightly as our own Mrs.\r\nJohn Sherwood, who translated 'Carcassonne' so well that she improved on\r\nthe original, because in her heart spring fresh and fragrant every day\r\nthe flowers of tender, human, Godlike sympathy.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Rigoletto,\" produced in the year Eighteen Hundred Fifty-one at Venice,\r\nis founded on Victor Hugo's \"Le Roi s'Amuse\"; and the music has all the\r\ndramatic fire that matches the Hugo plot. Verdi's devotion to Victor\r\nHugo is seen again in the use of \"Hernani\" for operatic purposes. \"Il\r\nTrovatore\" and \"La Traviata\" followed \"Rigoletto,\" and these three\r\noperas are usually put forward as the Verdi masterpieces. The composer\r\nhimself regarded them with a favor that may well be pardoned, since he\r\nused to say that he and his wife collaborated in their production--she\r\nwriting the music and he looking on. The proportion of truth and poetry\r\nin this statement is not on record. But the simple fact remains that \"Il\r\nTrovatore\" was always a favorite with Verdi, and even down to his death\r\nhe would travel long distances to hear it played. A correspondent of the\r\n\"Musical Courier,\" writing from Paris in Eighteen Hundred Eighty-seven,\r\nsays: \"Verdi and his wife occupied a box last evening at the Grand Opera\r\nHouse. The piece was 'Il Trovatore,' and many smiles were caused by the\r\nsight of the author and his spouse seemingly leading the claque as if\r\nthey would split their gloves.\"\r\n\r\nThe flaming forth of creative genius that produced the \"Rigoletto,\" \"Il\r\nTrovatore,\" and \"La Traviata,\" subsided into a placid calm.\r\n\r\nThe serene happiness of Verdi's married life, the fortune that had come\r\nto him, and the consciousness of having won in spite of great\r\nobstacles, led him to the thought of quiet and well-earned rest. The\r\nmaster interested himself in politics, and was elected to represent the\r\ndistrict of Parma in the Italian Parliament. He proved himself a man of\r\npower--practical, self-centered and businesslike--and as such served his\r\ncountry well.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment of the man is shown in his buying the property at Busseto,\r\nhis old home, which was owned by Signore Barezzi. He removed the high\r\npicket fence, replacing it with a low stone wall; remodeled the house\r\nand turned the conservatory into a small theater, where free concerts\r\nwere often given with the help of the villagers. The adjoining grounds\r\nand splendid park were free to the public.\r\n\r\nThe master's attention to music was now limited to enjoying it. So\r\npassed the days.\r\n\r\nTen years of the life of a country gentleman went by, and the Shah of\r\nPersia, who had been on a visit to Italy and met Verdi, sent a command\r\nfor an opera. The plot must be laid in the East, the characters Moorish,\r\nand the whole to be dedicated to the immortal Son of the Sun--the Shah.\r\n\r\nIt is a little doubtful whether the Shah knew that operas are produced\r\nonly in certain moods and can not be done to order as a carpenter builds\r\na fence. But it was the way that Eastern Royalty had of showing its high\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\nVerdi smiled, and his wife smiled, and they had quite a merry little\r\ntime over the matter, calling in the neighbors and friends, and drinking\r\nto the health of a real live Shah who knew a great musical genius when\r\nhe found one. But suddenly the matter began to take form in the master's\r\nmind. He set to work, and the result was that in a few weeks \"Aida\" was\r\ncompleted. The stories often told of the long preparation for composing\r\nthis opera reveal the fine imagination of the men who write for the\r\nnewspapers. Verdi seized upon knowledge as a devilfish absorbs its\r\nprey--he learned in the mass.\r\n\r\n\"Aida\" was first produced at Cairo in Eighteen Hundred Seventy-one, with\r\na grand setting and the best cast procurable. A new Verdi opera was an\r\nevent, and critics went from London, Paris, and other capitals to see\r\nthe performance.\r\n\r\nThe first thing the knowing ones said was that Verdi was touched with\r\nWagnerism, and that he had studied \"Lohengrin\" with painstaking care. If\r\nVerdi was influenced by Wagner it was for good; but there was no servile\r\nimitation in it. The \"Aida\" is rich in melody, reveals a fine balance\r\nbetween singers and orchestra, and the \"local color\" is correct even to\r\nthe chorus of Congo slaves that was introduced at the performance in\r\nCairo.\r\n\r\nAll agreed that the rest had done the master good, and the\r\ncorrespondents wrote, \"We will look anxiously for his next.\" They\r\nthought the stream had started and there would be an overflow.\r\n\r\nBut they were mistaken. Sixteen years of quiet farming followed. Verdi\r\nwas more interested in his flowers than his music, and told Philip Hale,\r\nwho made a pious pilgrimage to Busseto in Eighteen Hundred Eighty-three,\r\nthat he loved his horses more than all the prima donnas on earth.\r\n\r\nBut in Eighteen Hundred Eighty-seven, the artistic and music-loving\r\nworld was surprised and delighted with \"Otello.\" This grand performance\r\nmade amends for the mangling of \"Macbeth.\" James Huneker says: \"The\r\ncharacter-drawing in 'Otello' is done with the burin of a master; the\r\nplot moves in processional splendor; the musical psychology is subtle\r\nand inevitable. At last the genius of Verdi has flowered. The work is\r\nconsummate and complete.\"\r\n\r\n\"Falstaff\" came next, written by a graybeard of eighty as if just to\r\nprove that the heart does not grow old. It is the work of an\r\noctogenarian who loved life and had seen the world of show and sense\r\nfrom every side. Old men usually moralize and live in the past--not so\r\nhere. The play flows with a laughing, joyous, rippling quality that\r\ndisarmed the critics and they apologized for what they had said about\r\nWagnerian motives. There were no sad, solemn, recurring themes in the\r\nfull-ripened fruit of Verdi's genius. When he died, at the age of\r\neighty-seven, the curtain fell on the career of a great and potent\r\npersonality--the one unique singer of the Nineteenth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOLFGANG MOZART]\r\n\r\nWOLFGANG MOZART\r\n\r\n\r\n     Mozart composed nine hundred twenty-two pieces of which we know. He\r\n     is considered the greatest composer the world has ever seen, judged\r\n     by the versatility and power of his genius. In every kind of\r\n     composition he was equally excellent. Beside being a great composer\r\n     he was a great performer, being the most accomplished pianist of\r\n     his day. He was also an excellent player on the violin.\r\n\r\n     --_Dudley Buck_\r\n\r\n\r\nWOLFGANG MOZART\r\n\r\nApology: The Mozart \"Little Journey\" was written, and as over a month\r\nhad been taken to do the task, the result was something of which I was\r\njustly proud. It was quite unlike anything ever before written. The\r\nprinters were ready to take the work in hand, but I begged them to allow\r\nme two more days for careful revision; and as I was just starting away\r\nto give a lecture at Janesville, Wisconsin, I took the manuscript with\r\nme, intending to do the final work of revision on the train.\r\n\r\nAll went well on the journey, the lecture had been given with no special\r\ntokens of disapproval on part of the audience, and I was on board the\r\nearly morning train that leaves for Chicago. And as my mind is usually\r\nfairly clear in the early hours, I began work retouching the good\r\nmanuscript. We were nearing Beloit when I bethought me to go into the\r\nBuffet-Car for a moment.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned the manuscript was not to be seen. I looked in various\r\nseats, and under the seats, asked my neighbors, inquired of the\r\nbrakeman, and then hunted up the porter and asked him if he had seen my\r\nmanuscript. He did not at first understand what I meant by the term\r\n\"manuscript,\" but finally inquired if I referred to a pile of dirty,\r\ndog-eared sheets of paper, all marked up and down and over and\r\ncrisscross, ev'ry-which-way.\r\n\r\nI assured him that he understood the case.\r\n\r\nHe then informed me that he had \"chucked the stuff,\" that is to say, he\r\nhad tossed it out of the window, as he was cleaning up his car, just as\r\nhe always did before reaching Chicago.\r\n\r\nI made a frantic reach for the bell-cord, but was restrained. A\r\nsympathetic passenger came forward and explained that five miles back he\r\nhad seen the sheets of my precious manuscript sailing across the\r\nprairie. We were going at the rate of a mile a minute and the wind was\r\nblowing fiercely, so there was really no need of backing up the train to\r\nregain the lost goods.\r\n\r\n\"I hope dem scribbled papers was no 'count, boss!\" said the porter\r\nhumbly, as I stood sort of dazed, gazing into vacancy.\r\n\r\nI shook myself into partial sanity. \"Oh, they were of no value--I was\r\nlooking for them so as to throw them out of the window myself,\" I\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n\"Brush?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said I.\r\n\r\nI placed the expected quarter in his dusky palm, still pondering on what\r\nI should do.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the matter was impossible, for I have no verbal\r\nmemory--something must be written, though. I decided to leave Chicago in\r\nan hour by the Lake Shore Railroad, and have the copy ready for the\r\nRoycroft boys when I reached home.\r\n\r\nThis I did, and as I had no reference-books, maps or memoranda to guide\r\nme, the matter seems to lack synthesis. I say seems to lack--but it\r\nreally doesn't, for the facts will all be found to be as stated. Still\r\nthe form may be said to be slightly colored by the environment, so some\r\nexplanation is in order--hence this apology to the Gentle Reader. And\r\nfurther, if the Reader should find in these pages that, at rare\r\nintervals, I use the personal pronoun, he must bear in mind that I live\r\nin the country, and that it is the privilege and right, established by\r\nlong precedent and custom of country folk, to talk about themselves and\r\ntheir own affairs if they are so minded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChicago: Talent is usually purchased at a high price, and if the gods\r\ngive you a generous supply of this, they probably will be niggardly when\r\nit comes to that. But one thing the artist is usually long on, and that\r\nis whim. Let us all pray to be delivered from whim--it is the poisoner\r\nof our joys, the corrupter of our peace, and Dead-Sea fruit for all\r\nthose about us.\r\n\r\nHeaven deliver us from whim!\r\n\r\nI am told by a famous impresario, who gained some valuable experience by\r\nmarrying a prima donna, and therefore should know, that whim is purely a\r\nfeminine attribute. This, though, is surely a mistake, for there have\r\nlived men, as well as women, who had such an exaggerated sense of their\r\nown worth, that they lost sight, entirely, of the rights and feelings of\r\neverybody else. All through life they kept the stage waiting without\r\npunctilio. These men thought dogs were made to kick, servants to rail\r\nat, the public to be first crawled to and then damned, and all rivals to\r\nbe pooh-poohed, cursed or feared, as the mood might prompt. Further than\r\nthis they considered all landlords robbers, every railroad-manager a\r\nrogue, and businessmen they bunched as greedy, grasping Shylocks. They\r\nalways used the word \"commercial\" as an epithet.\r\n\r\nDevotees of the histrionic art can lay just claim to having more than\r\ntheir share of whim, but the musical profession has no reason to be\r\nabashed, for it is a good second. However, the actor's and the\r\nmusician's art are often not far separated. In speaking to James McNeil\r\nWhistler of a certain versatile musician, a lady once said, \"I believe\r\nhe also acts!\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame, he does nothing else,\" replied Mr. Whistler.\r\n\r\nArt is not a thing separate and apart--art is only the beautiful way of\r\ndoing things. And is it not most absurd to think, because a man has the\r\nfaculty of doing a thing well, that on this account he should assume\r\nairs and declare himself exempt along the line of morals and manners?\r\nThe expression \"artistic temperament\" is often an apologetic term, like\r\n\"literary sensitiveness,\" which means that the man has stuck to one task\r\nso long that he is unable to meet his brother men on a respectful\r\nequality.\r\n\r\nThe artist is the voluptuary of labor, and his fantastic tricks often\r\nseem to be only Nature's way of equalizing matters, and showing the\r\nworld that he is very common clay, after all. To be modest and gentle\r\nand kind, as we all can be, is just as much to God as to be learned and\r\ntalented, and yet be a cad.\r\n\r\nStill, instances of great talent and becoming modesty are sometimes\r\nfound; and in no great musician was the balance of virtues held more\r\ngracefully than with Mozart. He had humor.\r\n\r\nAh! that is it--he knew values--had a sense of proportion, and realized\r\nthat there is a time to laugh. And a good time to laugh is when you see\r\na mighty bundle of pretense and affectation coming down the street.\r\nDignity is the mask behind which we hide our ignorance; and our forced\r\ndignity is what makes the imps of comedy, who sit aloft in the sky, hold\r\ntheir sides in merriment when they behold us demanding obeisance because\r\nwe have fallen heir to tuppence worth of talent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLaporte: Mozart had a sense of humor. He knew a big thing from a little\r\none. When yet a child the tendency to comedy was strong upon him. When\r\nnine years of age he once played at a private musicale where the\r\nEmpress, Maria Theresa, was present. The lad even then was a consummate\r\nviolinist. He had just played a piece that contained such a tender,\r\nmournful, minor strain that several of the ladies were in tears. The boy\r\nseeing this, relentingly dashed off into a \"barnyard symphony,\" where\r\ndonkeys brayed, hens cackled, pigs squealed and cows mooed, all ending\r\nwith a terrific cat-fight on a wood-shed roof. This done, the boy threw\r\nhis violin down, ran across the room, climbed into the lap of the\r\nEmpress and throwing his arms around the neck of the good lady, kissed\r\nher a resounding smack first on one cheek, then on the other. It was all\r\nvery much like that performance of Liszt, who one day, when he was\r\nplaying the piano, suddenly shouted, \"Pitch everything out of the\r\nwindows!\" and then proceeded to do it--on the keyboard, of course.\r\n\r\nOn the same visit to the palace, when Mozart saluted Maria Theresa in\r\nhis playful way, he had the misfortune to slip and fall on the waxed\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette, daughter of Maria Theresa, just budding into\r\nwomanhood, ran and picked him up and rubbed his knee where it was hurt.\r\n\"You are a dear, good lady,\" said the boy in gratitude, \"and when I\r\ngrow up I am going to marry you.\" Liszt never made any such promise as\r\nthat. Liszt never offered to marry anybody. But it is too bad that Marie\r\nAntoinette did not hold the lad to his promise. It would have probably\r\nproved a valuable factor for her in the line of longevity; and her\r\nhusband's circumstances would have saved her from making that silly\r\ninquiry as to why poor people don't eat cake when they run short of\r\nbread. These moods of merriment continued with Mozart, as they did with\r\nLiszt, all his life--not always manifesting themselves, though, in the\r\nway just described.\r\n\r\nAs a companion I would choose Mozart--generous, unaffected, kind--rather\r\nthan any other musician who ever played, danced, sang or\r\ncomposed--excepting, well, say Brahms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSouth Bend: We take an interest in the lives of others because we\r\nalways, when we think of another, imagine our relationship to him. \"Had\r\nI met Shakespeare on the stairs I would have fainted dead away,\" said\r\nThackeray.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why we are interested in biography is because, to a\r\ndegree, it is a repetition of our own life.\r\n\r\nThere are certain things that happen to every one, and others we think\r\nmight have happened to us, and may yet. So as we read, we unconsciously\r\nslip into the life of the other man and confuse our identity with his.\r\nTo put yourself in his place is the only way to understand and\r\nappreciate him. It is imagination that gives us this faculty of\r\ntransmigration of souls; and to have imagination is to be universal; not\r\nto have it is to be provincial. Let me see--wouldn't you rather be a\r\ncitizen of the Universe than a citizen of Peoria, Illinois, which modest\r\ntown the actors always speak of as being one of the provinces?\r\n\r\nAs I read biography I always keep thinking what I would have done in\r\ncertain described circumstances, and so not only am I living the other\r\nman's life, but I am comparing my nature with his. Everything is\r\ncomparative; that is the only way we realize anything--by comparing it\r\nwith something else. As you read of the great man he seems very near to\r\nyou. You reach out across the years and touch hands with him, and with\r\nhim you hope, suffer, strive and enjoy: your existence is all blurred\r\nand fused with his.\r\n\r\nAnd through this oneness you come to know and comprehend a character\r\nthat has once existed, very much better than the people did who lived in\r\nhis day and were blind to his true worth by being ensnared in cliques\r\nthat were in competition with him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nElkhart: I intimated a few pages back that I would have liked to have\r\nMozart for a friend and companion. Mozart needed me no less than I need\r\nhim. \"Genius needs a keeper,\" once said I. Zangwill, probably with\r\nhimself in mind. We all need friends--and to be your brother's keeper is\r\nvery excellent if you do not cease being his friend. And poor Mozart did\r\nso need a friend who could stand between him and the rapacious wolf that\r\nscratched and sniffed at his door as long as he lived. I do not know why\r\nthe wolf sniffed, for Mozart really never had anything worth carrying\r\naway. He was so generous that his purse was always open, and so full of\r\nunmixed pity that the beggars passed his name along and made cabalistic\r\nmarks on his gateposts. Every seedy, needy, thirsty and ill-appreciated\r\nmusician in Germany regarded him as lawful prey. They used to say to\r\nMozart, \"I can not beg and to dig I am ashamed--so grant me a small\r\nloan, I pray thee.\"\r\n\r\nYes, Mozart needed me to plan his tours and market his wares. I'm no\r\ngenius, and although they say I was an infant terrible, I never was an\r\ninfant prodigy. At the tender age of six, Mozart was giving concerts and\r\nastonishing Europe with his subtle skill. At a like age I could catch a\r\nhorse with a nubbin, climb his back, and without a saddle or bridle\r\ndrive him wherever I listed by the judicious use of a tattered hat. Of\r\ncourse I took pains to mount only a horse that had arrived at years of\r\ndiscretion, matronly brood-mares or run-down plow-horses; but this is\r\nonly proof of my practical turn of mind. Mozart never learned how to\r\ncontrol either horse or man by means of a tattered hat or diplomacy:\r\nmusic was his hobby, and it was long years after his death before the\r\nworld discovered that his hobby was no hobby at all, but a genuine\r\nautomobile that carried him miles and miles, clear beyond all his\r\ncompetitors: so far ahead that he was really out of shouting distance.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Mozart took such an early start in life and drove his machinery\r\nso steadily, not to say so furiously, that at thirty-five all the\r\nbearings grew hot for lack of rebabbitting, and the vehicle went the way\r\nof the one-horse shay--all at once and nothing first, just as bubbles do\r\nwhen they burst.\r\n\r\nAt the age which Mozart died I had seen all I wanted to of business\r\nlife, in fact I had made a fortune, being the only man in America who\r\nhad all the money he wanted, and so just turned about and went to\r\ncollege. This I firmly hold is a better way than to be sent to college\r\nand then go into trade later and forget all you ever learned at school.\r\nI had rather go to college than be sent. Every man should get rich, that\r\nhe might know the worthlessness of riches; and every man should have a\r\ncollege education, just to realize how little the thing is worth.\r\n\r\nYes, Mozart needed a good friend whose abilities could have rounded out\r\nand made good his deficiencies. Most certainly I could not do the\r\nthings that he did, but I should have been his helper, and might, too,\r\nhad not a century, one wide ocean, and a foreign language separated us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWaterloo: Friendship is better than love for a steady diet. Suspicion,\r\njealousy, prejudice and strife follow in the wake of love; and disgrace,\r\nmurder and suicide lurk just around the corner from where love coos.\r\nLove is a matter of propinquity; it makes demands, asks for proofs,\r\nrequires a token. But friendship seeks no ownership--it only hopes to\r\nserve, and it grows by giving. Do not say, please, that this applies\r\nalso to love. Love bestows only that it may receive, and a one-sided\r\npassion turns to hate in a night, and then demands vengeance as its\r\nright and portion.\r\n\r\nFriendship asks no rash promises, demands no foolish vows, is strongest\r\nin absence, and most loyal when needed. It lends ballast to life, and\r\ngives steadily to every venture. Through our friends we are made\r\nbrothers to all who live.\r\n\r\nI think I would rather have had Mozart for a friend than to love and be\r\nloved by the greatest prima donna who ever warbled in high C. Friendship\r\nis better than love. Friendship means calm, sweet sleep, clear brain and\r\na strong hold on sanity. Love I am told is only friendship, plus\r\nsomething else. But that something else is a great disturber of the\r\npeace, not to say digestion. It sometimes racks the brain until the\r\nworld reels. Love is such a tax on the emotions that this way madness\r\nlies. Friendship never yet led to suicide.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nToledo: Yes, just at the age when Mozart wrote and played his \"Requiem,\"\r\ngetting ready to die, I was going to school and incidentally falling in\r\nlove. I was thirty-four and shaved clean because there were gray hairs\r\ncoming in my beard. Love has its advantages, of course, and the benefits\r\nof passionate love consist in scarifying one's sensibilities until they\r\nare raw, thus making one able to sympathize with those who suffer. Love\r\nsounds the feelings with a leaden plummet that sinks to the very depths\r\nof one's soul. This once done the emotions can return with ease, and so\r\nthis is why no singer can sing, or painter paint, or sculptor model, or\r\nwriter write, until love or calamity, often the same thing, has sounded\r\nthe depths of his soul. Love makes us wise because it makes room inside\r\nthe soul for thoughts and feelings to germinate; but passionate love as\r\na lasting mood would be hell. Henry Finck says that is why Nature has\r\nfixed a two-year limit on romantic or passionate love. \"War is hell,\"\r\nsaid General Sherman. \"All is fair in Love and War,\" says the old\r\nproverb. Love and War are one, say I. Love is mad, raging unrest and a\r\nvain, hot, reaching out for nobody knows what. Of course the kind which\r\nI am talking about is the Grand Passion, not the sort of sentiment that\r\none entertains towards his grandmother.\r\n\r\n\"But it is good to fall in love, just as it is well to have the\r\nmeasles,\" to quote Schopenhauer. Still, there is this difference: one\r\nonly has the measles once, but the man who has loved is never immune,\r\nand no amount of pledges or resolves can ere avail.\r\n\r\nJust here seems a good place to express a regret that the English\r\nlanguage is such a crude affair that we use the same word to express a\r\nman's regard for roast-beef, his dog, child, wife and Deity. There are\r\nthose who speedily cry, \"Hold!\" when one attempts to improve on the\r\nlanguage, but I now give notice that on the first rainy day I am going\r\nto create some distinctions and differentiate for posterity along the\r\nline just mentioned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nElyria: As intimated in a former chapter, I was a successful farmer\r\nbefore I went to college. I was also a manufacturer, and made a success\r\nin this business, too. I made a fortune of a hundred thousand dollars\r\nbefore I was thirty, and should have it yet had I sat down and watched\r\nit. If you go into a railroad-car and sit down by the side of your\r\nvalise (or manuscript), in an hour your valuables will probably be there\r\nall right.\r\n\r\nBut if you leave the valise (or the manuscript) in a seat and go into\r\nanother car, when you come back the goods may be there and they may not.\r\nThat is the only way to keep money--fasten your eye right on it. If you\r\nleave it in the hands of others, and go away to delve in books, the\r\nprobabilities are that, when you get back, certain obese attorneys have\r\ndivided your substance among them.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is good in every exigency of life, and to know that your\r\nfortune is gone is a great relief. When the trial is ended and the\r\nprisoner has received his sentence, he feels a great relief, for it is\r\nonly the unknown that fills our souls with apprehension.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCleveland: In all the realm of artistic history no record of such\r\nextremes can be found in one life as those seen in the life of Mozart.\r\nThe nearest approach to it is found in the career of Rembrandt, who won\r\nfame and fortune at thirty, and then holding the pennant high for ten\r\nyears, his powers began to decline. It took twenty-six years of steady\r\ndown grade to ditch his destinies in a pauper's grave.\r\n\r\nBut Rembrandt, during his lifetime, was scarcely known out of Holland,\r\nwhereas Mozart not only won the nod of nobility, and the favor of the\r\nhighest in his own land, but he went into the enemy's country and\r\ncaptured Italy. Mozart's art never languished: he held a firm grip on\r\nsublime verities right to the day of his death. The high-water mark in\r\nMozart's career was reached in those two years in Italy, when in his\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth years. The arts all go hand in hand, for the\r\nreason that strong men inspire strong men, and each does what he can do\r\nbest. In painting, sculpture and music (not to mention Antonio\r\nStradivari of Cremona) Italy has led the world. A hundred years ago no\r\nmusician could hope for the world's acclaim until Italy had placed its\r\nstamp of approval upon him.\r\n\r\nSavants in Milan, Florence, Padua, Rome, Verona, Venice and Naples,\r\ntested the powers of young Mozart to their fullest; and although he had\r\nto overcome doubt and the prejudice arising from being \"a barbaric\r\nGerman,\" yet the highest honors were at the last ungrudgingly paid him.\r\nHe was enrolled as an honorary member of numerous musical societies, old\r\nmusicians gave their blessings, proud ladies craved the privilege of\r\nkissing his fair forehead, and the Pope conferred upon the gifted boy\r\nthe Order of the Golden Spur, which gave him the right to have his mail\r\ncome directed to \"The Signor Cavaliere Mozarti.\"\r\n\r\nAt Naples the result of his marvelous playing was ascribed to\r\nenchantment, and this was thought to be centered in a diamond ring that\r\nhad been presented to the lad by a fair lady in a mood of ecstasy. To\r\nconvince the Neapolitans of their error Mozart was obliged to accept\r\ntheir challenge and remove the ring. He wrote home to his mother that he\r\nhad no time to practise, as in every city where he went artists insisted\r\non his sitting for his portrait.\r\n\r\nThe acme of attention and applause was reached at Milan, where he was\r\ncommissioned to write an opera for the Christmas festivities. The\r\nproduction of this opera at La Scala was the most glorious item in the\r\nlife of Mozart. A boy of fourteen conducting an opera of his own\r\ncomposition before enraptured multitudes is an event that stands to the\r\ncredit of Mozart, and Mozart alone. \"Evviva the Little Master--Evviva\r\nthe Little Master!\" cried the audience. \"It is music for the stars,\" and\r\nagainst all precedent aria after aria had to be repeated. The boy,\r\nalways rather small for his age, stood on a chair to wield his baton,\r\nand the flowers that were rained upon him nearly covered the lad from\r\nview.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAshtabula: The place of a man's birth does not honor him until after he\r\nis dead, and every man of genius has been distrusted by his intimate\r\nkinsmen. If he is granted recognition by the outside world, those who\r\nhave known him from childhood wink slyly and repeat Phineas T. Barnum's\r\naphorism, a free paraphrase of which the Germans have used since the\r\ndays of the Vandals.\r\n\r\nLeopold Mozart returned home with his wonderful boy not much richer than\r\nwhen he went away. He had left the management of finances to others, and\r\nwas quite content to travel in a special carriage, stop at the best\r\nhotels, and have any \"label\" he might order, just for the asking.\r\n\r\nReports had reached Germany of the wonderful success of the youthful\r\nMozart in Italy, but Vienna smiled and Salzburg sneezed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNorth East: It is not so very long ago that all the beautiful things of\r\nearth were supposed to belong to the Superior Class. That is to say, all\r\nthe toilers, all the workers in metals, all the bookmakers, authors,\r\npoets, painters, sculptors and musicians, did their work to please this\r\nnoble or that. All bands of singers were singers to His Lordship, and if\r\na man wrote a book he dedicated it to His Royal Highness. At first these\r\nthinkers and doers were veritable slaves, and no court was complete that\r\ndid not have its wise man who wore the cap and bells, and made puns,\r\nepigrams and quoted wise saws and modern instances for his board and\r\nkeep. This man usually served as a clerk or overseer, during his odd\r\nhours, and only appeared to give a taste of his quality when he was sent\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nIt was the same with the musicians and singers--they were cooks, waiters\r\nand valets, and when there were guests these performers were notified to\r\nbe in readiness to \"do something\" if called upon. It was the same with\r\npainters--every court had its own. Rubens, as we know, was looked upon\r\nby the Duke of Mantua as his private property, and the artist had to run\r\naway, when the time was ripe, to save his soul alive. Van Dyck was court\r\npainter to Charles the First, and married when he was told to do so.\r\n\r\nThere is no such office as \"Poet Laureate of England\"--the Laureate is\r\npoet to the King, and used to dine with the Master of the Hounds. Later\r\nhe was allowed to choose his domicile and live in his own house, like\r\nSaint Paul, the prisoner at Rome. His yearly stipend is yet that tierce\r\nof Canary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSilver Creek: Leopold Mozart, and the son who caused his name to endure,\r\nwere in the employ of the Archbishop of Salzburg. The Archbishop was a\r\nveritable prince, with short breath and a double chin, and no shade of\r\ndoubt ever came to him concerning the divinity of his succession. He\r\nruled by divine right, and everybody and everything were made to\r\nminister to the well-being of his person and estate. The Mozarts were\r\ntoo poor to escape from the employ of the Archbishop, and he took pains\r\nto warn all interested persons not to harbor, encourage or entice his\r\nservants away on penalty of dire displeasure. Mozart ate with the\r\nservants, and we have his letters written to his sister showing how his\r\nseat was next below that of the coachman. When he was to play before\r\ninvited guests he was made to wait in the entry until the footman called\r\nhim, and there he often stood for hours, first on one foot, then on t'\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to ask why a man of such sublime talent should endure such\r\ntreatment, but the simple fact is Mozart was gentle, yielding,\r\nkind--immersed in his music--with no power to set his will against the\r\ntide of tendency that 'compassed him round. The Archbishop forbade his\r\nplaying at concerts or entertainments, and blocked the way to all\r\nadvancement. The Archbishop didn't have a diplomat like Rubens to cope\r\nwith, or a fighter like Wagner, or a plotter like Liszt, or a\r\nstiletto-bearing man like Paganini, and so Mozart wrote his music on a\r\ntable in one corner of a beer-garden, and waltzed with his wife,\r\nConstance, to keep warm when there was no fire and the weather was cold,\r\nand all the time danced attendance on the Archbishop of Salzburg. All of\r\nhis feeble, spasmodic efforts at freedom came to naught, because there\r\nwas no persistency behind them.\r\n\r\nGladly would he have sold his services for three hundred gulden a year,\r\nbut even this sum, equal to one hundred fifty dollars a year, was denied\r\nhim. He was always composing, always making plans, always seeing the\r\nsilver tint in the clouds, but all of his music was taken by this one or\r\nthat in whom he foolishly trusted, and only debt and humiliation\r\nfollowed him.\r\n\r\nWhen at long intervals a sum would come his way from a generous admirer\r\ntouched with pity, all the beggars in the neighborhood seemed to know it\r\nat once. Then it was that music filled the air at the beer-garden,\r\ncarking care and unkind fate were for the time forgot, and all went\r\nmerry as a wedding-bell.\r\n\r\nFinally the position of Court Musician to the Emperor of Austria fell\r\nvacant, and certain good friends of Mozart secured him the place. But\r\nthe Emperor was not like Frederick the Great, for he could not\r\ndistinguish one tune from another, and did not consider it any special\r\nvirtue so to do. The result was that his musicians were looked after by\r\nhis valet, and Mozart found that his position was really no better than\r\nit had been with the Archbishop of Salzburg.\r\n\r\nAnd still his mind proved infirm of purpose, and he had not the courage\r\nto demand his right, for fear he might lose even the little that he\r\nhad.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBuffalo: Mozart was in his twentieth year when he met Aloysia Weber. She\r\nwas a gifted singer, surely, and was needlessly healthy. She was of that\r\npeculiar, heartless type that finds digression in leading men a merry\r\nchase and then flaunting and flouting them. Young Mozart, the\r\nimpressionable, Mozart the delicate and sensitive, Mozart the Æolian\r\nharp, played upon by every passing breeze, loved this bouncing bundle of\r\npink-and-white tyranny.\r\n\r\nShe encouraged the passion, and it gradually grew until it absorbed the\r\nboy and he grew oblivious to all else. He lived in her smile, bathed in\r\nthe sunshine of her presence, fed on her words, and as for her singing\r\nin opera it was not so much what her voice was now but what he was sure\r\nit would be.\r\n\r\nHis glowing imagination made good her every deficiency. He thought he\r\nloved the girl. It was not the girl at all he loved: he only loved the\r\nideal that existed in his own heart. His father opposed the mating and\r\nhastily transferred the youth from Vienna to Paris; but who ever heard\r\nof opposition and argument and forced separation curing love? So matters\r\nran on and letters and messages passed, and finally Mozart made his way\r\nback to Vienna and with breathless haste sought out the object of his\r\nwhole heart's love.\r\n\r\nShe had recently met a man she liked better, and as she could not hold\r\nthem both, treated Mozart as a stranger, and froze him to the marrow.\r\n\r\nHe was crushed, undone, and a fit of sickness followed. In his illness,\r\nConstance, a younger sister of Aloysia, came to him in pity and nursed\r\nhim as a child. Very naturally, all the love he had felt for Aloysia was\r\neasily and readily transferred to Constance. The tendrils of the heart\r\nruthlessly uprooted cling to the first object that presents itself.\r\n\r\nAnd so Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Constance Weber were married. And\r\nthey were happy ever afterward. It would have been much better if they\r\nhad quarreled, but Mozart's gentle, yielding character readily adapted\r\nitself to the weaker nature of his wife. In his music she took a sort of\r\nblind and deaf delight and guessed its greatness because she loved the\r\nman. But when two weak wills combine, the net result is increased\r\nweakness--never strength.\r\n\r\nConstance was as beautiful a specimen of the slipshod housekeeper as\r\never piled away breakfast dishes unwashed, or swept dirt under a settee.\r\nIf they had money she bought things they did not need, and if there was\r\nno money she borrowed provisions and forgot to return the loan.\r\nIrregularity of living, deprivation and hope deferred, made the woman\r\nill and she became a chronic sufferer. But she was ever tended with\r\nloving, patient care by the overburdened and underfed husband.\r\n\r\nA biographer tells how Mozart would often arise early in the morning to\r\nset down some melody in music that he had dreamed out during the night.\r\nOn such occasions he would leave a little love-letter for his wife on\r\nthe stand at the head of the bed, where she would find it on first\r\nawakening. One such note, freely translated, runs as follows:\r\n\"Good-morning, Dear Little Wife. I hope you rested well and had sweet\r\ndreams. You were sleeping so peacefully that I dare not kiss your cheek\r\nfor fear of disturbing you. It is a beautiful morning and a bird outside\r\nis singing a song that is in my heart. I am going out to catch the\r\nstrain and write it down as my own and yours. I shall be back in an\r\nhour.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEast Aurora: Aloysia married the man of her choice--an actor by the name\r\nof Lange. They quarreled right shortly, and soon he used to beat her.\r\nThis was endured for a year or more, then she left him. For a while she\r\nlived with Wolfgang and Constance, and Mozart, true to his nature, gave\r\nher from his own scanty store and deprived himself for her benefit. He\r\nstood godfather to one of her children and was a true friend to her to\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\nAfter Aloysia lived to be an old woman, and long after Mozart had passed\r\nout, and the world had begun to utter his praises, she said: \"I never\r\nfor a moment thought he was a genius--I always considered him just a\r\nnice little man.\"\r\n\r\nMozart's soul was filled with melody, and all of his music is faultless\r\nand complete. He possessed the artistic conscience to a degree that is\r\nunique. Careless and heedless in all else, if his mood was not right and\r\nthe product was halting, he straightway destroyed the score. He was\r\nalways at work, always hearing sweet sounds, always weighing and\r\nbalancing them in the delicate scales of his judgment.\r\n\r\nSo absorbed was he in his art that he fell an easy victim to the\r\ndesigning, and never stopped his work long enough to strike off the\r\nshackles that bound him to a vain, selfish and unappreciative court.\r\n\r\nWorn by constant work, worried by his wife's continued illness, dogged\r\nby creditors, and unable to get justice from those who owed it to him,\r\nhis nerves at the early age of thirty-five gave way.\r\n\r\nHis vitality rapidly declined and at last went out as a candle does when\r\nblown upon by a sudden gust from an open door.\r\n\r\nIt was a blustering winter day in December, Seventeen Hundred\r\nNinety-one, when his burial occurred. A little company of friends\r\nassembled, but no funeral-dirge was played for him, save the blast blown\r\nthrough the naked branches of the trees, as they hurried the plain pine\r\ncoffin to its final resting-place. At the gate of the cemetery the few\r\nfriends turned back and left the lifeless clay to the old gravedigger,\r\nwho never guessed the honor thus done him.\r\n\r\nIt was a pauper's grave that closed over the body of Mozart--coffin\r\npiled on coffin, and no one marked the spot. All we know is, that\r\nsomewhere in Saint Mark's Cemetery, Vienna, was buried in a trench the\r\nmost accomplished composer and performer the world has ever known. It\r\nwas a hundred years afterward before the city made tardy amends by\r\nerecting a fitting monument to his memory.\r\n\r\nHis best monument is his work. The melody that once filled his soul is\r\nyours and mine; for by his art he made us heirs to all that wealth of\r\nlove that was never requited, and the dreams, that for him never came\r\ntrue, are our precious and priceless legacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHANNES BRAHMS]\r\n\r\nJOHANNES BRAHMS\r\n\r\n\r\n     What is music? This question occupied my mind for hours last night\r\n     before I fell asleep. The very existence of music is wonderful, I\r\n     might even say miraculous. Its domain is between thought and\r\n     phenomena. Like a twilight mediator, it hovers between spirit and\r\n     matter, related to both, yet differing from each. It is spirit, but\r\n     spirit subject to the measurement of time; it is matter, but matter\r\n     that can dispense with space.\r\n\r\n     --_Heine_\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHANNES BRAHMS\r\n\r\nEmerson has said that, next to the man who first voices a great truth,\r\nis the one who quotes it.\r\n\r\nTruth is in the air; it belongs to all who can appreciate it; and the\r\ndifference between the man who gives a truth expression and the listener\r\nwho at once comprehends and repeats it, is very slight. If you\r\nunderstand what I say, it is because you have thought the same thoughts\r\nyourself--I merely express for you that which you already know. And so\r\nyou approve and applaud, not stopping to think that you are applauding\r\nyour own thought; and your heart beats fast and you say, \"Yes, yes, why\r\ndidn't I say that myself!\"\r\n\r\nAll conversation is a sort of communion--an echoing back and forth of\r\nthoughts, feelings and emotions. We clarify our thoughts by expressing\r\nthem--no idea is quite your own until you tell it to another.\r\n\r\nMusic is simply one form of expression. Its province is to impart a\r\nsublime emotion. To give himself is the controlling impulse in the heart\r\nof every artist--to impart to others the joy he feels--this is the\r\ndominant motive in his life.\r\n\r\nHence the poet writes, the artist paints, the sculptor models, the\r\nsinger sings, the musician plays--all is expression--a giving voice to\r\nthe Silence. But it is all done for others. In ministering to others the\r\nartist ministers to himself. In helping others we help ourselves. We\r\ngrow strong through exercise, and only the faculties that are\r\nexercised--that is to say, expressed--become strong. Those not in use\r\natrophy and fall victims to arrested development.\r\n\r\nMan is the instrument of Deity--through man does Deity create. And the\r\nartist is one who expresses for others their best thoughts and feelings.\r\nHe may arouse in men emotions that were dormant, and so were unguessed;\r\nbut under the spell of the artist-spirit, these dormant faculties are\r\nawakened from lethargy--they are exercised, and once the thrill of life\r\nis felt through them, they will probably be exercised again and again.\r\n\r\nAll art is collaboration between the performer and the partaker--music\r\nis especially a collaboration. It is a oneness of feeling: action and\r\nreaction, an intermittent current of emotion that plays backward and\r\nforward between the player and his audience. The player is the positive\r\npole, or masculine principle; and the audience the negative pole, or\r\nfeminine principle.\r\n\r\nIn great oratory the same transposition takes place. Almost every one\r\ncan recall occasions when there was an absolute fusion of thought,\r\nfeeling and emotion between the speaker and the audience--when one mind\r\ndominated all, and every heart beat in unison with his. The great\r\nmusician is the one who feels intensely, and is able to express\r\nvividly, and thus impart his emotion to others.\r\n\r\nRobert Schumann was such a man. In his youth, when he played at parlor\r\ngatherings he could fuse the listeners into an absolute oneness of\r\nspirit. You can not make others feel unless you yourself feel; you can\r\nnot make others see unless you yourself see. Robert Schumann saw. He\r\nbeheld the moving pictures, and as they passed before him he expressed\r\nwhat he saw in harmonious sounds. His many admirers say he gave\r\n\"portraits\" on the piano, and by sounds would describe certain persons,\r\nso others who knew these persons would recognize them and call their\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nSterndale Bennett has told of Schumann's playing Weber's \"Invitation to\r\nthe Dance,\" and accompanying it with little verbal explanations of what\r\nhe saw, thus: \"There,\" said the player as he struck the opening chords,\r\n\"there, he bows, and so does she--he speaks--she speaks, and oh! what a\r\nvoice--how liquid! listen--hear the rustle of her gown--he speaks, a\r\nlittle deeper, you notice--you can not hear the words, only their voices\r\nblending in with the music--now they speak together--they are lovers,\r\nsurely--see, they understand--oh! the waltz--see them take those first\r\nsteps--they are swaying into time--away!--there they go--look!--you can\r\nnot hear their voices now--only see them!\"\r\n\r\nSchumann studied law, and had he followed that profession he would have\r\nmade a master before a jury. He saw so clearly and felt so deeply, and\r\nwas so full of generosity and bubbling good-cheer, that he was\r\nirresistible. As we know, he proved so to Clara Wieck, who left father\r\nand mother and home to cleave to this unknown composer.\r\n\r\nThis splendid young woman was nine years younger than Robert, but she\r\nhad already made a name and fortune for herself before they were\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\nIn passing it is well enough to call attention to the fact that this is\r\none of the great loves of history. It ranks with the mating of Robert\r\nBrowning and Elizabeth Barrett. How strange that such things are so\r\nexceptional that the world takes note of them!\r\n\r\nYet for quite a number of years after their marriage, Madame Schumann\r\nwas at times asked this question: \"Is your husband musical?\"\r\n\r\nBut Robert Schumann, like Robert Browning, was too big a man to be\r\njealous of his wife. Jealousy is an acknowledgment of weakness and\r\ninsecurity. \"Robert and Clara,\" their many dear friends always called\r\nthem. They worked together--composed, sang, played, and grew great\r\ntogether. And as if to refute the carping critics who cry that\r\ndomesticity and genius are incompatible, Clara Schumann became the happy\r\nmother of eight children, and not a year passed but she appeared upon\r\nthe concert stage, while a nurse held the baby in the wings. Schumann\r\nwas very proud of his wife. He was grateful to her for interpreting his\r\nsongs in a way he could not. His lavish heart went out to every one who\r\nexpressed the happiness and harmony which he felt singing in his soul.\r\n\r\nAnd so he welcomed all players and all singers, and all who felt the\r\ninfluence of an upward gravitation. Especially was he a friend of the\r\nyoung and the unknown. His home at Dusseldorf was a Mecca for the\r\naspiring--worthy and unworthy--and to these he gave his time, money and\r\ninfluence. \"Genius must have recognition--we will discover and bring\r\nforth these beautiful souls; we will liberate and give them to the\r\nworld,\" he used to say. Not only did he himself express great things,\r\nbut he quoted others.\r\n\r\nAmong those who had reverenced the Schumanns from afar, came a young man\r\nof twenty, small and fair-haired, from Hamburg. He was received at the\r\nregular \"Thursday Night\" with various other strangers. These meetings\r\nwere quite informal, and everybody was asked to play or sing. On being\r\ninvited to play, our young man declined. But on a second visit he sat\r\ndown at the piano and played. It was several minutes before the company\r\nceased the little buzz of conversation and listened--the fledglings were\r\nnever taken seriously except by the host and hostess. The youth leaned\r\nover the keyboard, and seemed to gather confidence from the sympathetic\r\nattitude of the listeners, and especially Clara Schumann, who had come\r\nforward and stood at his elbow.\r\n\r\nHe played from Schumann's \"Carnival,\" and as he played, freedom came to\r\nhim. He surprised himself. When he ceased playing, Robert kissed his\r\ncheek, and the company were vehement in their applause. Next day\r\nSchumann met Albert Dietrich, another disciple who had come from a\r\ndistance to bask in the Schumann sunshine, and said with an air of\r\nmystery: \"One has come of whom we shall yet hear great things. His name\r\nis Johannes Brahms.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have at least four separate accounts of Brahms' first appearance and\r\nbehavior when he arrived at the city of Dusseldorf. These descriptions\r\nare by Robert and Clara Schumann, Doctor Dieters and Albert Dietrich.\r\nAll agree that Johannes Brahms was a most fascinating personality.\r\nDieters and Dietrich were about the age of Brahms, and were lesser\r\nsatellites swinging just outside the Schumann orbit. Very naturally when\r\na new devotee appeared, they gazed at him askance. Many visitors were\r\ncoming and going, and from most of them there was nothing to fear, but\r\nwhen this short, deep-chested boy with flaxen hair appeared, Dietrich\r\nfelt there was danger of losing his place at the right hand of the\r\nMaster.\r\n\r\nBrahms carried his chin in, and the crown of his head high. He was\r\ninfinitely good-natured, met everybody on an equality, without abasement\r\nor condescension. He was modest, never pushed himself to the front, and\r\nwas always ready to listen. A talented performer who can listen well, is\r\nsure to be loved. And yet when Brahms went forward to play, there was\r\njust a suggestion of indifference to his hearers in his manner, and a\r\nhalf-haughty self-confidence that won before he had sounded a note. We\r\nalways believe in people who believe in themselves.\r\n\r\nYoung Brahms brought a letter of introduction from Joachim. But that was\r\nnothing--Joachim was always giving letters to everybody. He was like\r\nthe men who sign every petition that is presented; or those other good\r\nmen who give certificates of character to people they do not know, and\r\nrecommendation letters to those for whom they have no use.\r\n\r\nSo the letter went for little with Robert Schumann--it was the way\r\nBrahms approached the piano, and settled his hands and great shock-head\r\nover the keyboard, that won.\r\n\r\n\"He is no beginner,\" whispered Clara to Robert before Johannes had\r\ntouched a key.\r\n\r\nIt didn't take Brahms long to get acquainted--he mixed well. In a few\r\ndays he dropped into that half-affectionate way of calling his host and\r\nhostess by their first names, and they in turn called him \"Johannes.\"\r\nAnd to me this is very beautiful, for, at the last, souls are all of one\r\nage. More and more we are realizing that getting old is only a bad\r\nhabit. The only man who is old is the one who thinks he is. Of course\r\nthese remarks about age do not exactly apply just here, for no member of\r\nthe trinity we are discussing was advanced in years. Robert was\r\nforty-three, Clara was thirty-four, and Johannes was twenty.\r\n\r\nJohannes Brahms was thrice well blest in being well born. His parents\r\nwere middle-class people, fairly well-to-do. They proved themselves\r\ncertainly more than middle-class in intellect, when they adopted the\r\nplan of being the companions and comrades of their children. Johannes\r\ngrew up with no slavish fear of \"old folks.\" He had worked with his\r\nfather, studied with him; learned lessons from books with his mother,\r\nand played \"four hands\" with her at the piano, by the hour, just for\r\nfun.\r\n\r\nThen when Remenyi came that way with his violin, and wanted a pianist,\r\nhe took young Brahms. When their lines crossed the line of Liszt, they\r\nplayed for him at his inn; and then Liszt played for them.\r\n\r\nThis Remenyi was our own \"Ol' Man Remenyi,\" who passed over only a year\r\nor so ago. I wonder if he was Ol' Man Remenyi then! He never really was\r\nan old man, and that appellation was more a mark of esteem than anything\r\nelse--a sort of diminutive of good-will. I met Remenyi at Chautauqua,\r\nwhere he spent a month or more in Eighteen Hundred Ninety-three. He gave\r\nme my first introduction to the music of Brahms, of whom he never tired\r\nof talking. He considered Brahms without a rival--the culminating flower\r\nof modern music; and if the Ol' Man slightly exaggerated his own\r\ninfluence in bringing Brahms out and presenting him to the world, I am\r\nnot the one to charge it up against his memory.\r\n\r\nIn explaining Brahms and his music, Remenyi used to grow animated, and\r\nwhen words failed he would say, \"Here, it was just like this\"--and then\r\nhe would seize his violin, the bow would wave through the air, and the\r\nnotes would tell you how Brahms transposed Beethoven's \"Kreutzer\r\nSonata\" from A to B flat--a feat he never could have performed if\r\nRemenyi had not told him how. It was Remenyi who introduced Brahms to\r\nJoachim, and it was Joachim who introduced Brahms to Schumann, and it\r\nwas Schumann's article, \"New Paths,\" in the \"Neue Zeitschrift fur\r\nMusik,\" that placed Brahms on a pedestal before the world. Brahms was\r\nnot the great man that Schumann painted, Remenyi thought, but the\r\nidealization caused him to put forth a heroic effort to be what Clara\r\nand Robert considered him. So it was really these two who compelled him\r\nto push on: otherwise he might have relaxed into a mere concert\r\nperformer or a leader of some subsidized band.\r\n\r\nRemenyi always seemed to me like a choice antique mosaic, a trifle\r\nweather-worn, set into the present. He used to quote Liszt as if he\r\nlived around the corner, and would criticize Wagner, and tell of\r\nMoescheles, Haertel, the Mendelssohns and the Schumanns, as if they\r\nmight all gather tomorrow and play for us at the Hall in the Grove.\r\n\r\nRecently I met dear old Herr Kappes, eighty years young, who knew the\r\nMendelssohns, and admired Brahms, loved Clara Schumann, and liked\r\nRemenyi--sometimes. They were too much alike, I fear, to like each other\r\nall the time. But the harmony is still in the heart of Herr Kappes. He\r\ngives music-lessons, and lectures, and will explain to you just how and\r\nwhere Brahms differs from Schumann, and where Schubert separates from\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nHerr Kappes can speak five languages, but even with them all he finds\r\ndifficulty in making his meaning clear, and at times adopts the Remenyi\r\nplan, and will just turn to the piano and cry, \"It's like this, see!\r\nSchumann wrote it in this way\"--and then the strong hands will chase the\r\nkeys down and back and over and up. \"But Brahms took the motif and set\r\nit like this\"--and Herr Kappes will strike the bass a thunderous\r\nstroke--pause, look at you, glide back and down, up and over, and you\r\nare carried away in a swirl of sweet sounds, and see a pink face framed\r\nin its beautiful aureole of white hair. You listen but you do not \"see\"\r\nthe fine distinctions, because you do not care--Herr Kappes is all there\r\nis of it, so animated, so gentle, so true, so lovable--because he used\r\nto pay court to Fanny Mendelssohn and then transferred his affections to\r\nClara Schumann, and now just loves his art, and everybody.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSchumann's article, \"New Paths,\" at once determined Brahms' career. He\r\nmust either live up to the mark that had been set for him--or else run\r\naway.\r\n\r\nI give below an extract from Robert's estimate of Brahms and his work:\r\n\r\n     Ten years have passed away, as many as I formerly devoted to the\r\n     publication of this paper--since I have allowed myself to commit my\r\n     opinions to this soil so rich in memories. Often in spite of an\r\n     overstrained productive activity, I have felt moved to do so; many\r\n     new and remarkable talents have made their appearance, and a fresh\r\n     musical power seemed about to reveal itself among the many aspiring\r\n     artists of the day, even if their compositions were only known to\r\n     the few.\r\n\r\n     I thought to follow with interest the pathways of these elect;\r\n     there would--there must--after such a promise, suddenly appear one\r\n     who should utter the highest ideal expression of the times, who\r\n     should claim the mastership by no gradual development, but burst\r\n     upon us fully equipped, as Minerva sprang from the brain of\r\n     Jupiter. And he has come, this chosen youth, over whose cradle the\r\n     Graces and Heroes seem to have kept watch.\r\n\r\n     His name is Johannes Brahms; he comes from Hamburg, where he has\r\n     been working in quiet obscurity, instructed by an excellent,\r\n     enthusiastic teacher in the most difficult principles of his art,\r\n     and lately introduced to me by an honored and well-known master.\r\n     His mere outward appearance assures us that he is one of the\r\n     elect.\r\n\r\n     Seated at the piano, he disclosed wondrous regions. We were drawn\r\n     into an enchanted circle. Then came a moment of inspiration which\r\n     transformed the piano into an orchestra of wailing and jubilant\r\n     voices. There were sonatas, or rather veiled symphonies, songs\r\n     whose poetry revealed itself without the aid of words, while\r\n     throughout them all ran a vein of deep song-melody, several pieces\r\n     of a half-demoniacal character, but of charming form; then sonatas\r\n     for piano and violin, string quartets, and each of these creations\r\n     so different from the last that they appeared to flow from so many\r\n     different sources. Then, like an impetuous torrent, he seemed to\r\n     unite these streams into a foaming waterfall; over the tossing\r\n     waves the rainbow presently stretches its peaceful arch, while on\r\n     the banks butterflies flit to and fro, and the nightingale warbles\r\n     her song.\r\n\r\n     Whenever he bends his magic wand towards great works, and the\r\n     powers of orchestra and chorus lend him their aid, still more\r\n     wonderful glimpses of the ideal world will be revealed to us.\r\n\r\n     May the Highest Genius help him onward! Meanwhile another\r\n     genius--that of modesty--seems to dwell within him. His comrades\r\n     greet him at his first step in the world, where wounds may,\r\n     perhaps, await him, but the bay and the laurel also; we welcome\r\n     this valiant warrior!\r\n\r\nRobert Schumann had been before the public as essayist, poet, pianist\r\nand composer for twenty years. He had given himself without stint to\r\nalmost every musical enterprise of Germany, and his sympathy was ever on\r\ntap for every needy and aspiring genius. You may give your purse--he\r\nwho takes it takes trash--but to give your life's blood and then hope\r\nfor a renewal of life's lease, is vain.\r\n\r\nThe public man owes to himself and to his Maker the duty of reserve.\r\n\r\nThe desert and mountain are very necessary to the individual who gives\r\nhimself to the public. That any man should so bestride the narrow world\r\nlike a colossus that the multitude must stop to gaze, and thousands feed\r\nupon his words, is an abnormal condition. The only thing that can hold\r\nthe balance true is solitude. Relaxation is the first requirement of\r\nstrength. Watch the cat, the tiger or the lion asleep. See what complete\r\nabsence of intensity--what perfect relaxation! It is all a preparation\r\nfor the spring.\r\n\r\nSchumann had not sought the mountain, nor abandoned himself to the woods\r\nin old shoes, corduroys and a flannel shirt. Now he was paying the\r\npenalty of publicity. Virtue had gone out of him; and in the article\r\njust quoted, there are signs that he is clutching for something. He\r\nhails this new star and proclaims him, because in some way he feels that\r\nthe ruddy, valiant and youthful Brahms is to consummate his work. Brahms\r\nis an extension of himself. It is a part of that longing for\r\nimmortality--we perpetuate ourselves in our children and look for them\r\nto accomplish what we have been unable to do.\r\n\r\nJohannes Brahms was the spiritual son of Robert Schumann.\r\n\r\nIn less than a year after Brahms and Schumann first met, there were\r\nominous signs and evil portents in the air. \"Why do you play so fast,\r\ndear Johannes? I beg of you, be moderate!\" cried Robert on one occasion.\r\nBrahms turned, and his quick glance caught the ashy face and bloodshot\r\neyes of a sick man. His reply was a tear and a hand-grasp.\r\n\r\nSoon, to Schumann, all music was going at a gallop, and in his ears\r\nforever rang the sound of A. He could hear naught else. Tenderness,\r\npatience, and even love were of no avail. Indeed, love is not exempt\r\nfrom penalty--the law of compensation never rests. Nature forever\r\nstrives for a right adjustment.\r\n\r\nThe richness and intensity of Schumann's life were bought with a price.\r\nThe first year after his marriage he composed one hundred thirty-eight\r\nsongs. Sonatas, scherzos, symphonies and ballads followed fast, and in\r\nit all his gifted wife had gloried.\r\n\r\nBut when, in Eighteen Hundred Fifty-four, Robert had, after sleepless\r\nnights, in a fit of frenzy thrown himself into the Rhine, and had been\r\nrescued, shattered, unable to recognize even his nearest friends--the\r\nloyal and devoted wife saw where she herself had erred.\r\n\r\nWriting to Brahms she says: \"I encouraged him in his work, and this\r\nfired his ambition to do and to become. Oh! why did I not restrain that\r\nintensity and send him away into the solitude to be a boy; to do nothing\r\nbut frolic and play and bathe in the sunshine, and eat and sleep? The\r\nlife of an artist is death. Kill ambition, my Brother!\"\r\n\r\nActivity and rest--both are needed. The idea of the \"retreat\" in the\r\nCatholic Church is founded on stern, hygienic science. Wagner's forced\r\nexile was not without its advantages, and the \"retreats\" of Paganini and\r\nthe \"retirements\" of Liszt were very useful factors in the devolution of\r\ntheir art.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the malady that beset Robert Schumann, there was no cure save death;\r\nhis only rest, the grave. When his spirit passed away in Eighteen\r\nHundred Fifty-six, his devoted wife and the loyal Brahms attended him.\r\nOwing to the insidious creeping of the disease, Schumann's affairs had\r\ngot into bad shape; and it was now left to Brahms, more than all others,\r\nto smooth the way of life for the stricken wife and her fatherless\r\nbrood.\r\n\r\nThe versatility and sturdy commonsense of Brahms were now in evidence.\r\nIn business affairs he was ready, decisive and systematic. And the\r\ndelicacy, tact and charming good-nature he ever showed, reveal the man\r\nas a most extraordinary figure. Great talent is often bought at a\r\nprice--how well we know this, especially with musicians! But Brahms was\r\nsane on all subjects. He could take care of his own affairs, lend a\r\nneeded hand with others, but never meddle--smile with that half-sardonic\r\ngrimace at all foolish little things, weep with the stricken when\r\ncalamity came; yet above it all the little man towered, carrying himself\r\nlike the giant that he was. And yet he never made the mistake of taking\r\nhimself too seriously. \"I am trying to run opposition to Michelangelo's\r\n'Moses,'\" he once called to Dietrich, as he leaned out of the window in\r\nthe sunshine, and stroked his flowing beard. In his later years many\r\nhave testified to this Jovelike quality that Brahms diffused by his\r\npresence. No one could come into his aura and fail to feel his sense of\r\npower. Around such souls is a sacred circle--if you are allowed to come\r\nwithin this boundary, it is only by sufferance; within this space only\r\nthe pure in heart can dwell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTolstoy in \"Anna Karenina\" speaks of that quiet and constant light to be\r\nseen on the faces of those who are successful--those who know that their\r\nsuccess is acknowledged by the world.\r\n\r\nBrahms was a successful man by temperament, for success (like East\r\nAurora) is a condition of mind. There is no tragedy for those who do not\r\naccept tragedy; and the treatment we receive from others is only our own\r\nreflected thought.\r\n\r\nBrahms thought well of everybody, if he thought of any one at all. He\r\nreveled in the sunshine, and everywhere made friends of children. \"We\r\nsaw Brahms on the hotel veranda at Domodossola,\" wrote a young woman to\r\nme in Eighteen Hundred Ninety-five, \"and what do you think?--he was on\r\nall fours, with three children on his back, riding him for a horse!\"\r\n\r\nFor many years Brahms used to make an annual pilgrimage to Italy, and\r\noften on these tours at fairs he would fall in with Gipsy bands. At such\r\ntimes he would always stop and listen, and would lustily applaud the\r\nperformance. On one such occasion, Dietrich tells, the leader recognized\r\nBrahms, and instantly rapped for silence. He was seen to pass the\r\nwhispered word along, and then the band struck up one of Brahms' pieces,\r\ngreatly to the delight of the composer.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of the people, and I am glad to know that he hated a table\r\nd'hote, smiled a smile of derision at all dress-coats, had small\r\nsympathy with pink teas, loved his friends, doted on babies, and was\r\nnever so happy as when in the country walking along grass-grown lanes in\r\nthe early summer morning, when the dew was on and the air was melodious\r\nwith the song of birds. He had a habit of going bareheaded, carrying his\r\nhat in his hand; and on these country walks, always with bared head, he\r\nwould sing or whistle, and unconsciously in his mind the music would be\r\ntaking shape that was to be written out later in the quiet of his study.\r\n\r\nBrahms knew the world--not simply one little part of it--he knew it as\r\nthoroughly as any man can, and was interested in it all. He knew the\r\nworld of workers--the toilers and bearers of burdens. He knew the weak\r\nand the vicious, and his heart went out to them in sympathy; for he knew\r\nhis own heart and realized the narrow margin that separates the\r\nso-called \"good\" from the alleged \"bad.\" He knew that sin is only a\r\nwrong expression of life, and reacts to the terrible disadvantage of the\r\nsinner.\r\n\r\nHe was interested in mechanics--bookbinding, printing, iron-working,\r\ncarpentry, and was well acquainted with all new inventions and\r\nlabor-saving devices. He knew the methods of farming, the different\r\nbreeds of cattle; he knew what soil would produce best a certain crop,\r\nand understood \"rotation.\" He could call the wild birds by name and\r\nimitate their notes, and studied long their haunts and habits. That\r\nexcellent man and talented, George Herschel, in a letter to a friend\r\nspeaks of walking with Johannes Brahms along the highway, and Brahms\r\nsuddenly calling in alarm, \"Look out! look out! you may kill it!\"\r\n\r\nIt was only a tumblebug, but he shrank from putting foot on any living\r\nthing. Brahms reverenced all life, and felt in his heart that he was\r\nbrother to that bug in the dust, to the birds that chirruped in the\r\nhedgerows, and to the trees that lifted their outstretching branches to\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nHe was deeply religious--although he never knew it. All music is a hymn\r\nof praise, a song of thanksgiving, a chant of faith. Music is a making\r\nmanifest to our dull ears the divine harmony of the universe, and thus\r\nall music is sacred music, and all true musicians are priests, for by\r\ntheir ministrations we are made to realize our Oneness with the Whole.\r\nThrough music we read the Universal.\r\n\r\nMusic is the only one of the arts that can not be prostituted to a base\r\nuse. We hear of bad books, of the \"Index Expurgatorius,\" and in every\r\nState there are laws against the publication of immoral books and\r\nindecent pictures. We also hear of orders issued by the courts requiring\r\ncertain statues to be removed or veiled, but no indictment can be\r\nbrought against music. It is the only one of the arts that is always\r\npure.\r\n\r\nBrahms realized this and felt the dignity of his office, holding high\r\nthe standard; and yet he knew that the toilers in the fields were doing\r\na service to humanity, just as necessary as his own. And possibly this\r\nis why he uncovered, walking with bared head. All is holy, all is\r\ngood--it is all God's world, and all the men and women in it are His\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor forty-two years Brahms was the devoted friend of Clara Schumann. She\r\nwas thirteen years his senior, yet their spirits were as children\r\ntogether. From the first he was to her, \"Johannes,\" and she was \"Clara\"\r\nto him. A few of their letters have been published in the \"Revue des\r\ndeux Mondes,\" and this woman, who was a great-grandmother, and had sixty\r\nyears before captured a world, then in her seventy-fifth year, wrote to\r\nher \"Dear Johannes\" with all the gentle fervor of a girl of twenty,\r\ncongratulating him on some recent success. In reply he writes back to\r\nhis \"Dear Clara\" in gracious banter; mentions rheumatism in his legs as\r\nan excuse for bad penmanship; hopes she is keeping up her practise;\r\ntells of a \"Steinway Grand\" that some one has sent him, and regrets that\r\nshe does not come to try it \"four hands,\" as he has failed utterly to\r\nget out of it alone the melody that he knows is there.\r\n\r\nBrahms never married--the bond between himself and Clara was too sacred\r\nto allow another to sever or share it. And yet the relationship was so\r\nhigh, so frank, so openly avowed, that no breath of scandal has ever\r\nsmirched it.\r\n\r\nThe purity and excellence of it all has been its own apology, as love\r\never should be its own excuse for being.\r\n\r\nFor about three months every year these two friends dwelt near each\r\nother. Together they worked, composed, sang, read, wrote and roamed the\r\nwoods. \"None of Madame Schumann's children is as young as she is,\"\r\nwrote Doctor Hanslick, when Clara was sixty and Johannes was\r\nforty-seven. \"With the hope of passing for her father, Brahms is\r\ncultivating a patriarchal beard,\" continues Hanslick.\r\n\r\nIn his essay on \"Friendship,\" Emerson speaks of the folly of forcing our\r\npersonal presence on the friend we love best, and of the faith that\r\nideality brings. Something of this thought is shown in the letters of\r\nMadame Schumann to Brahms, and in his to her.\r\n\r\nOften for six months they would not meet, he doing his work in his own\r\nway, she doing hers, but each ever conscious of the life and love of the\r\nother--feeding on the ideal--writing or not writing, but glorying in\r\neach other's triumphs--lives linked first by the love of a third person,\r\ncemented by dire calamity, and then fused by a oneness of hope and\r\naspiration.\r\n\r\nBrahms' nature was too decidedly masculine, that is to say, one-sided,\r\nto exist without the love of woman; Clara Schumann, gentle, generous,\r\nmotherly, plastic, needed Johannes no less than he needed her.\r\n\r\nWhen Clara's spirit passed away, in May, Eighteen Hundred Ninety-six,\r\nBrahms attended her funeral at Frankfort. Hero that he was in body and\r\nspirit, the shock unnerved him. No rebound came--every bodily faculty\r\nseemed to have lost its buoyancy. The doctors tried to cheer him by\r\ntelling him that he had no organic ailment, and that twenty years of\r\nlife and work were before him. He knew better, and told them so. Men do\r\nnot live any longer than they wish to. \"Shall I live to see the\r\nanniversary of her death?\" asked Brahms of the doctor in March, Eighteen\r\nHundred Ninety-seven. \"Oh, undoubtedly--you can live many years if you\r\nonly will to,\" was the answer. Three weeks later--on April Third--Max\r\nKalbrech telegraphed to Widmann, this message, \"Brahms fell asleep early\r\nthis morning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    SO HERE ENDETH \"LITTLE JOURNEYS TO THE HOMES OF GREAT MUSICIANS,\"\r\n    BEING VOLUME FOURTEEN OF THE SERIES, AS WRITTEN BY ELBERT HUBBARD:\r\n    EDITED AND ARRANGED BY FRED BANN; BORDERS AND INITIALS BY ROYCROFT\r\n    ARTISTS, AND PRODUCED BY THE ROYCROFTERS, AT THEIR SHOPS, WHICH ARE\r\n    IN EAST AURORA, ERIE COUNTY, NEW YORK, MCMXXII\r\n\r\n\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|Transcriber's note: The index covers the complete set of \"Little |\r\n|Journeys\" books.                                                 |\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n(_Compiled for Wm.
