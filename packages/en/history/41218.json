Both were clever fellows.\r\nCharles was much the cleverer of the two.\" Thus John Evelyn and Samuel\r\nPepys, the former a perfect model of decorum, the latter a grievous\r\nexample of indecorum, have respectively left us diaries, of which the\r\nindecorous is to the decorous as a zoölogical garden is to a museum:\r\nwhile the disparity between the testamentary bequests of the two Austins\r\nbut imperfectly represents the reputation standing to Pepys's account\r\nwith posterity in comparison with that accruing to his sedate and\r\ndignified contemporary.\r\n\r\nMuseums, nevertheless, have their uses, and Evelyn's comparatively jejune\r\nrecord has laid us under no small obligation. But for Pepys's amazing\r\nindiscretion and garrulity, qualities of which one cannot have too little\r\nin life, or too much in the record of it, Evelyn would have been esteemed\r\nthe first diarist of his age. Unable for want of these qualifications to\r\ndraw any adequate picture of the stirring life around him, he has\r\nexecuted at least one portrait admirably, his own. The likeness is,\r\nmoreover, valuable, as there is every reason to suppose it typical, and\r\nrepresentative of a very important class of society, the well-bred and\r\nwell-conducted section of the untitled aristocracy of England. We may\r\nwell believe that these men were not only the salt but the substance of\r\ntheir order. There was an ill-bred section exclusively devoted to\r\nfestivity and sport. There was an ill-conducted section, plunged into the\r\ndissipations of court life. But the majority were men like Evelyn: not,\r\nperhaps, equally refined by culture and travel, or equally interested in\r\nliterary research and scientific experiment, but well informed and\r\npolite; no strangers to the Court, yet hardly to be called courtiers,\r\nand preferring country to town; loyal to Church and King but not\r\nfanatical or rancorous; as yet but slightly imbued with the principles of\r\ncivil and religious liberty, yet adverse to carry the dogma of divine\r\nright further than the right of succession; fortunate in having survived\r\nall ideas of serfdom or vassalage, and in having few private interests\r\nnot fairly reconcilable with the general good. Evelyn was made to be the\r\nspokesman of such a class, and, meaning to speak only for himself, he\r\ndelivers its mind concerning the Commonwealth and the Restoration, the\r\nconduct of the later Stuart Kings and the Revolution.\r\n\r\nEvelyn's Diary practically begins where many think he had no business to\r\nbe diarising, beyond the seas. The position of a loyalist who solaces\r\nhimself in Italy while his King is fighting for his crown certainly\r\nrequires explanation: it may be sufficient apology for Evelyn that\r\nwithout the family estates he could be of no great service to the King,\r\nand that these, lying near London, were actually in the grasp of the\r\nParliament. He was also but one of a large family and it was doubtless\r\nconvenient that one member should be out of harm's way. His three years'\r\nabsence (1643-6) has certainly proved advantageous to posterity. Evelyn\r\nis, indeed, a mere sight-seer, but this renders his tour a precise record\r\nof the objects which the sight-seer of the seventeenth century was\r\nexpected to note, and a mirror not only of the taste but of the feeling\r\nof the time. There is no cult of anything, but there is curiosity about\r\neverything; there is no perception of the sentiment of a landscape, but\r\nreal enjoyment of the landscape itself; antiquity is not unappreciated,\r\nbut modern works impart more real pleasure. Of the philosophical\r\nreflections which afterward rose to the mind of Gibbon there is hardly a\r\nvestige, and of course Evelyn is at an immeasurable distance from Byron\r\nand De Staël. But he gives us exactly what we want, the actual attitude\r\nof a cultivated young Englishman in presence of classic and renaissance\r\nart with its background of Southern nature. We may register without undue\r\nself-complacency a great development of the modern world in the\r\næsthetical region of the intellect, which implies many other kinds of\r\nprogress. It is interesting to compare with Evelyn's narrative the\r\nchapters recording the visit to Italy supposed to have been made at this\r\nvery period by John Inglesant, who inevitably sees with the eyes of the\r\nnineteenth century. Evelyn's casual remarks on foreign manners and\r\ninstitutions display good sense, without extraordinary insight; in\r\ndescription he is frequently observant and graphic, as in his account of\r\nthe galley slaves, and of Venetian female costumes. He naturally regards\r\nAlpine scenery as \"melancholy and troublesome.\"\r\n\r\nReturned to England, Evelyn strictly follows the line of the average\r\nEnglish country gentleman, execrating the execution of Charles I.,\r\ndisgusted beyond measure with the suppression of the Church of England\r\nservice, but submissive to the powers that be until there are evident\r\nindications of a change, which he promotes in anything but a Quixotic\r\nspirit. Although he is sincerely attached to the monarchy, the condition\r\nof the Church is evidently a matter of greater concern to him: Cromwell\r\nwould have done much to reconcile the royalists to his government, had it\r\nbeen possible for him to have restored the liturgy and episcopacy. The\r\nsame lesson is to be derived from his demeanor during the reigns of\r\nCharles and James. The exultation with which the Restoration is at first\r\nhailed soon evaporates. The scandals of the Court are an offense,\r\nnotwithstanding Evelyn's personal attachment to the King. But the chief\r\npoint is not vice or favoritism or mismanagement, but alliances with\r\nRoman Catholic powers against Protestant nations. Evelyn is enraged to\r\nsee Charles missing the part so clearly pointed out to him by Providence\r\nas the protector of the Protestant religion all over Europe. The\r\nconversion of the Duke of York is a fearful blow, James's ecclesiastical\r\npolicy after his accession adds to Evelyn's discontent day by day, while\r\npolitical tyranny passes almost without remark. At last the old cavalier\r\nis glad to welcome the Prince of Orange as deliverer, and though he has\r\nno enthusiasm for William in his character as King, he remains his\r\ndutiful subject. Just because Evelyn was by no means an extraordinary\r\nperson, he represents the plain straightforward sense of the English\r\ngentry. The questions of the seventeenth century were far more religious\r\nthan political. The synthesis \"Church and King\" expressed the dearest\r\nconvictions of the great majority of English country families, but when\r\nthe two became incompatible they left no doubt which held the first place\r\nin their hearts. They acted instinctively on the principle of the Persian\r\nlady who preferred her brother to her husband. It was not impossible to\r\nfind a new King, but there was no alternative to the English Church.\r\n\r\nEvelyn's memoirs thus possess a value far exceeding the modest measure of\r\nworth allowed them by De Quincey: \"They are useful as now and then\r\nenabling one to fix the date of a particular event, but for little\r\nbesides.\" The Diary's direct contribution to historical accuracy is\r\ninsignificant; it is an index, not to chronological minutiæ, but to the\r\ngeneral progress of moral and political improvement. The editor of 1857\r\ncertainly goes too far in asserting that \"All that might have been\r\nexcluded from the range of his opinions, his feelings and sympathies\r\nembraced\"; but it is interesting to observe the gradual widening of\r\nEvelyn's sympathies with good men of all parties, and to find him in his\r\nlatter days criticising the evidence produced in support of the Popish\r\nPlot on the one hand, and deploring the just condemnation of Algernon\r\nSydney on the other. It is true that, so far as the sufferings of his\r\ncountry are concerned, his attitude is rather that of the Levite than of\r\nthe Samaritan; but more lively popular sympathies would have destroyed\r\nthe peculiar value attaching to the testimony of the reluctant witness.\r\nWe should, for example, have thought little of such a passage as the\r\nfollowing from the pen of Burnet, from Evelyn it is significant indeed:--\r\n\r\n    _October 14, 1688._--The King's birthday. No guns from the Tower as\r\n    usual. The sun eclipsed at its rising. This day signal for the\r\n    victory of William the Conqueror against Harold, near Battel in\r\n    Sussex. The wind, which had been hitherto west, was east all this\r\n    day. Wonderful expectation of the Dutch fleet. Public prayers\r\n    ordered to be read in the churches against invasion.\r\n\r\nIt might be difficult to produce a nearer approximation in secular\r\nliterature to Daniel's \"_Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin_.\"\r\n\r\nThere is little else in the Diary equally striking, though Evelyn's\r\ndescription of Whitehall on the eve of the death of Charles the Second\r\nranks among the memorable passages of the language. It is nevertheless\r\nfull of interesting anecdotes and curious notices, especially of the\r\nscientific research which, in default of any adequate public\r\norganization, was in that age more efficaciously promoted by students\r\nthan by professors. De Quincey censures Evelyn for omitting to record the\r\nconversation of the men with whom he associated, but he does not consider\r\nthat the Diary in its present shape is a digest of memoranda made long\r\npreviously, and that time failed at one period and memory at the other.\r\nDe Quincey, whose extreme acuteness was commonly evinced on the negative\r\nside of a question, saw the weak points of the Diary upon its first\r\npublication much more clearly than his contemporaries did, and was\r\nbetrayed into illiberality by resentment at what he thought its\r\nundeserved vogue. Evelyn has in truth been fortunate; his record, which\r\nhis contemporaries would have neglected, appeared (1818) just in time to\r\nbe a precursor of the Anglican movement, a tendency evinced in a similar\r\nfashion by the vindication, no doubt mistaken, of the Caroline authorship\r\nof the \"Icon Basilike.\" Evelyn was a welcome encounter to men of this\r\ncast of thought, and was hailed as a model of piety, culture, and\r\nurbanity, without sufficient consideration of his deficiencies as a\r\nloyalist and a patriot. It also conduced to his reputation that all his\r\nother writings should have virtually perished except his \"Sylva,\" like\r\nhis Diary a landmark in the history of improvement, though in a widely\r\ndifferent department. But for his lack of diplomatic talent, he might be\r\ncompared with an eminent and much applauded, but in our times somewhat\r\ndecrescent, contemporary, Sir William Temple. Both these eminent persons\r\nwould have aroused a warmer feeling in posterity, and have effected more\r\nfor its instruction and entertainment, if they could occasionally have\r\ndashed their dignity with an infusion of the grotesqueness, we will not\r\nsay of Pepys, but of Roger North. To them, however, their dignity was\r\ntheir character, and although we could have wished them a larger measure\r\nof geniality, we must feel indebted to them for their preservation of a\r\nrefined social type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Richard Garnett (signature)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nEvelyn lived in the busy and important times of King Charles I., Oliver\r\nCromwell, King Charles II., King James II., and King William, and early\r\naccustomed himself to note such things as occurred, which he thought\r\nworthy of remembrance. He was known to, and had much personal intercourse\r\nwith, the Kings Charles II. and James II.; and he was in habits of great\r\nintimacy with many of the ministers of these two monarchs, and with many\r\nof the eminent men of those days, as well among the clergy as the laity.\r\nForeigners distinguished for learning, or arts, who came to England, did\r\nnot leave it without visiting him.\r\n\r\nThe following pages contribute extensive and important particulars of\r\nthis eminent man. They show that he did not travel merely to count\r\nsteeples, as he expresses himself in one of his Letters: they develop his\r\nprivate character as one of the most amiable kind. With a strong\r\npredilection for monarchy, with a personal attachment to Kings Charles\r\nII. and James II., formed when they resided at Paris, he was yet utterly\r\naverse to the arbitrary measures of these monarchs.\r\n\r\nStrongly and steadily attached to the doctrine and practice of the Church\r\nof England, he yet felt the most liberal sentiments for those who\r\ndiffered from him in opinion. He lived in intimacy with men of all\r\npersuasions; nor did he think it necessary to break connection with\r\nanyone who had ever been induced to desert the Church of England, and\r\nembrace the doctrines of that of Rome. In writing to the brother of a\r\ngentleman thus circumstanced, in 1659, he expresses himself in this\r\nadmirable manner: \"For the rest, we must commit to Providence the success\r\nof times and mitigation of proselytical fervors; having for my own\r\nparticular a very great charity for all who sincerely adore the Blessed\r\nJesus, our common and dear Saviour, as being full of hope that God\r\n(however the present zeal of some, and the scandals taken by others at\r\nthe instant [present] affliction of the Church of England may transport\r\nthem) will at last compassionate our infirmities, clarify our judgments,\r\nand make abatement for our ignorances, superstructures, passions, and\r\nerrors of corrupt times and interests, of which the Romish persuasion can\r\nno way acquit herself, whatever the present prosperity and secular polity\r\nmay pretend. But God will make all things manifest in his own time, only\r\nlet us possess ourselves in patience and charity. This will cover a\r\nmultitude of imperfections.\"\r\n\r\nHe speaks with great moderation of the Roman Catholics in general,\r\nadmitting that some of the laws enacted against them might be mitigated;\r\nbut of the Jesuits he had the very worst opinion, considering them as a\r\nmost dangerous Society, and the principal authors of the misfortunes\r\nwhich befell King James II., and of the horrible persecutions of the\r\nProtestants in France and Savoy.\r\n\r\nHe must have conducted himself with uncommon prudence and address, for he\r\nhad personal friends in the Court of Cromwell, at the same time that he\r\nwas corresponding with his father-in-law, Sir Richard Browne, the\r\nAmbassador of King Charles II. at Paris; and at the same period that he\r\npaid his court to the King, he maintained his intimacy with a disgraced\r\nminister.\r\n\r\nIn his travels, he made acquaintance not only with men eminent for\r\nlearning, but with men ingenious in every art and profession.\r\n\r\nHis manners we may presume to have been most agreeable; for his company\r\nwas sought by the greatest men, not merely by inviting him to their own\r\ntables, but by their repeated visits to him at his own house; and this\r\nwas equally the case with regard to ladies, of many of whom he speaks in\r\nthe highest style of admiration, affection, and respect. He was master of\r\nthe French, Italian, and Spanish languages. That he had read a great deal\r\nis manifest; but at what time he found opportunities for study, it is not\r\neasy to say. He acknowledges himself to have been idle, while at Oxford;\r\nand, when on his travels, he had little time for reading, except when he\r\nstayed about nineteen weeks in France, and at Padua, where he was\r\nlikewise stationary for several months. At Rome, he remained a\r\nconsiderable time, but, while there, he was so continually engaged in\r\nviewing the great variety of interesting objects to be seen in that city,\r\nthat he could have found little leisure for reading. When resident in\r\nEngland, he was so much occupied in the business of his numerous offices,\r\nin paying visits, in receiving company at home, and in examining whatever\r\nwas deemed worthy of curiosity, or of scientific observation, that it is\r\nastonishing how he found the opportunity to compose the numerous books\r\nwhich he published, and the much greater number of Papers, on almost\r\nevery subject, which still remain in manuscript; to say nothing of the\r\nvery extensive and voluminous correspondence which he appears to have\r\ncarried on during his long life, with men of the greatest eminence in\r\nChurch and State, and the most distinguished for learning, both\r\nEnglishmen and foreigners. In this correspondence he does not seem to\r\nhave made use of an amanuensis; and he has left transcripts in his own\r\nhand of great numbers of letters both received and sent. He observes,\r\nindeed, in one of these, that he seldom went to bed before twelve, or\r\nclosed his eyes before one o'clock.\r\n\r\nHe was happy in a wife of congenial dispositions with his own, of an\r\nenlightened mind, who had read much, and was skilled in etching and\r\npainting, yet attentive to the domestic concerns of her household, and a\r\nmost affectionate mother.\r\n\r\nHis grandfather, George, was not the first of the family who settled in\r\nSurrey. John, father of this George, was of Kingston, in 1520, and\r\nmarried a daughter of David Vincent, Esq., Lord of the Manor of Long\r\nDitton, near Kingston, which afterward came in the hands of George, who\r\nthere carried on the manufacture of gunpowder. He purchased very\r\nconsiderable estates in Surrey, and three of his sons became heads of\r\nthree families, viz, Thomas, his eldest son, at Long Ditton; John, at\r\nGodstone, and Richard at Wotton. Each of these three families had the\r\ntitle of Baronet conferred on them at different times, viz, at Godstone,\r\nin 1660; Long Ditton, in 1683; and Wotton, in 1713.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of gunpowder was carried on at Godstone as well as at\r\nLong Ditton; but it does not appear that there ever was any mill at\r\nWotton, or that the purchase of that place was made with such a view.\r\n\r\nIt may be not altogether incurious to observe, that though Mr. Evelyn's\r\nfather was a man of very considerable fortune, the first rudiments of\r\nthis son's learning were acquired from the village schoolmaster over the\r\nporch of Wotton Church. Of his progress at another school, and at\r\ncollege, he himself speaks with great humility; nor did he add much to\r\nhis stock of knowledge, while he resided in the Middle Temple, to which\r\nhis father sent him, with the intention that he should apply to what he\r\ncalls \"an impolished study,\" which he says he never liked.\r\n\r\nThe \"Biographia\" does not notice his tour in France, Flanders, and\r\nHolland, in 1641, when he made a short campaign as a volunteer in an\r\nEnglish regiment then in service in Flanders.[1] Nor does it notice his\r\nhaving set out, with intent to join King Charles I. at Brentford; and\r\nsubsequently desisting when the result of that battle became known, on\r\nthe ground that his brother's as well as his own estates were so near\r\nLondon as to be fully in power of the Parliament, and that their\r\ncontinued adherence would have been certain ruin to themselves without\r\nany advantage to his Majesty. In this dangerous conjuncture he asked and\r\nobtained the King's leave to travel. Of these travels, and the\r\nobservations he made therein, an ample account is given in this Diary.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: This expression is, perhaps, hardly applicable to the\r\n    fact of Evelyn's having witnessed a siege merely as a curious\r\n    spectator. He reached the camp on the 2d, and left it on the 8th of\r\n    August, 1641. It is certain, however, that during these six days he\r\n    took his turn on duty, and trailed a pike.--See Diary.]\r\n\r\nThe national troubles coming on before he had engaged in any settled plan\r\nfor his future life, it appears that he had thoughts of living in the\r\nmost private manner, and that, with his brother's permission, he had even\r\nbegun to prepare a place for retirement at Wotton. Nor did he afterward\r\nwholly abandon his intention, if the plan of a college, which he sent to\r\nMr. Boyle in 1659, was really formed on a serious idea. This scheme is\r\ngiven at length in the \"Biographia,\" and in Dr. Hunter's edition of the\r\n\"Sylva\" in 1776; but it may be observed that he proposes it should not be\r\nmore than twenty-five miles from London.\r\n\r\nAs to his answer to Sir George Mackenzie's panegyric on Solitude, in\r\nwhich Mr. Evelyn takes the opposite part and urges the preference to\r\nwhich public employment and an active life is entitled,--it may be\r\nconsidered as the playful essay of one who, for the sake of argument,\r\nwould controvert another's position, though in reality agreeing with his\r\nown opinion; if we think him serious in two letters to Mr. Abraham\r\nCowley, dated 12th March and 24th August, 1666, in the former of which he\r\nwrites: \"You had reason to be astonished at the presumption, not to name\r\nit affront, that I, who have so highly celebrated recess, and envied it\r\nin others, should become an advocate for the enemy, which of all others\r\nit abhors and flies from. I conjure you to believe that I am still of the\r\nsame mind, and that there is no person alive who does more honor and\r\nbreathe after the life and repose you so happily cultivate and advance by\r\nyour example; but, as those who praised dirt, a flea, and the gout, so\r\nhave I public employment in that trifling Essay, and that in so weak a\r\nstyle compared with my antagonist's, as by that alone it will appear I\r\nneither was nor could be serious, and I hope you believe I speak my very\r\nsoul to you.\r\n\r\n    '_Sunt enim Musis sua ludicra mista Camoenis\r\n    Otia sunt----_'\"\r\n\r\nIn the other, he says, \"I pronounce it to you from my heart as oft as I\r\nconsider it, that I look on your fruitions with inexpressible emulation,\r\nand should think myself more happy than crowned heads, were I, as you,\r\nthe arbiter of mine own life, and could break from those gilded toys to\r\ntaste your well-described joys with such a wife and such a friend, whose\r\nconversation exceeds all that the mistaken world calls happiness.\" But,\r\nin truth, Mr. Evelyn's mind was too active to admit of solitude at all\r\ntimes, however desirable it might appear to him in theory.\r\n\r\nAfter he had settled at Deptford, which was in the time of Cromwell, he\r\nkept up a constant correspondence with Sir Richard Browne (his\r\nfather-in-law), the King's Ambassador at Paris; and though his connection\r\nmust have been known, it does not appear that he met with any\r\ninterruption from the government here. Indeed, though he remained a\r\ndecided Royalist, he managed so well as to have intimate friends even\r\namong those nearly connected with Cromwell; and to this we may attribute\r\nhis being able to avoid taking the Covenant, which he says he never did\r\ntake. In 1659, he published \"An Apology for the Royal Party\"; and soon\r\nafter printed a paper which was of great service to the King, entitled\r\n\"The Late News, or Message from Brussels Unmasked,\" which was an answer\r\nto a pamphlet designed to represent the King in the worst light.\r\n\r\nOn the Restoration, we find him very frequently at Court; and he became\r\nengaged in many public employments, still attending to his studies and\r\nliterary pursuits. Among these, is particularly to be mentioned the Royal\r\nSociety, in the establishment and conduct of which he took a very active\r\npart. He procured Mr. Howard's library to be given to them; and by his\r\ninfluence, in 1667, the Arundelian Marbles were obtained for the\r\nUniversity of Oxford.\r\n\r\nHis first appointment to a public office was in 1662, as a Commissioner\r\nfor reforming the buildings, ways, streets, and incumbrances, and\r\nregulating hackney coaches in London. In the same year he sat as a\r\nCommissioner on an inquiry into the conduct of the Lord Mayor, etc.,\r\nconcerning Sir Thomas Gresham's charities. In 1664 he was in a commission\r\nfor regulating the Mint; in the same year was appointed one of the\r\nCommissioners for the care of the Sick and Wounded in the Dutch war; and\r\nhe was continued in the same employment in the second war with that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the Commissioners for the repair of St. Paul's Cathedral,\r\nshortly before it was burned in 1666. In that year he was also in a\r\ncommission for regulating the farming and making saltpetre; and in 1671\r\nwe find him a Commissioner of Plantations on the establishment of the\r\nboard, to which the Council of Trade was added in 1672.\r\n\r\nIn 1685 he was one of the Commissioners of the Privy Seal, during the\r\nabsence of the Earl of Clarendon (who held that office), on his going\r\nLord Lieutenant to Ireland. On the foundation of Greenwich Hospital, in\r\n1695, he was one of the Commissioners; and, on the 30th of June, 1696,\r\nlaid the first stone of that building. He was also appointed Treasurer,\r\nwith a salary of £200 a year; but he says that it was a long time before\r\nhe received any part of it.\r\n\r\nWhen the Czar of Muscovy came to England, in 1698, proposing to instruct\r\nhimself in the art of shipbuilding, he was desirous of having the use of\r\nSayes Court, in consequence of its vicinity to the King's dockyard at\r\nDeptford. This was conceded; but during his stay he did so much damage\r\nthat Mr. Evelyn had an allowance of £150 for it. He especially regrets\r\nthe mischief done to his famous holly hedge, which might have been\r\nthought beyond the reach of damage. But one of Czar Peter's favorite\r\nrecreations had been to demolish the hedges by riding through them in a\r\nwheelbarrow.\r\n\r\nOctober, 1699, his elder brother, George Evelyn, dying without male\r\nissue, aged eighty-three, he succeeded to the paternal estate; and in May\r\nfollowing, he quitted Sayes Court and went to Wotton, where he passed the\r\nremainder of his life, with the exception of occasional visits to London,\r\nwhere he retained a house. In the great storm of 1703, he mentions in his\r\nlast edition of the \"Sylva,\" above one thousand trees were blown down in\r\nsight of his residence.\r\n\r\nHe died at his house in London, 27th February, 1705-6, in the\r\neighty-sixth year of his age, and was buried at Wotton. His lady survived\r\nhim nearly three years, dying 9th February, 1708-9, in her seventy-fourth\r\nyear, and was buried near him at Wotton.\r\n\r\nOf Evelyn's children, a son, who died at the age of five, and a daughter,\r\nwho died at the age of nineteen, were almost prodigies. The particulars\r\nof their extraordinary endowments, and the profound manner in which he\r\nwas affected at their deaths, may be seen in these volumes.\r\n\r\nOne daughter was well and happily settled; another less so; but she did\r\nnot survive her marriage more than a few months. The only son who lived\r\nto the age of manhood, inherited his father's love of learning, and\r\ndistinguished himself by several publications.\r\n\r\nMr. Evelyn's employment as a Commissioner for the care of the Sick and\r\nWounded was very laborious; and, from the nature of it, must have been\r\nextremely unpleasant. Almost the whole labor was in his department, which\r\nincluded all the ports between the river Thames and Portsmouth; and he\r\nhad to travel in all seasons and weathers, by land and by water, in the\r\nexecution of his office, to which he gave the strictest attention. It\r\nwas rendered still more disagreeable by the great difficulty which he\r\nfound in procuring money for support of the prisoners. In the library at\r\nWotton, are copies of numerous letters to the Lord Treasurer and Officers\r\nof State, representing, in the strongest terms, the great distress of the\r\npoor men, and of those who had furnished lodging and necessaries for\r\nthem. At one time, there were such arrears of payment to the victuallers,\r\nthat, on landing additional sick and wounded, they lay some time in the\r\nstreets, the publicans refusing to receive them, and shutting up their\r\nhouses. After all this trouble and fatigue, he found as great difficulty\r\nin getting his accounts settled.[2] In January, 1665-6, he formed a plan\r\nfor an Infirmary at Chatham, which he sent to Mr. Pepys, to be laid\r\nbefore the Admiralty, with his reasons for recommending it; but it does\r\nnot appear that it was carried into execution.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: 2d October, 1665, he writes to the Lord Chancellor,\r\n    Lord Arlington, Sir William Coventry, and Sir Philip Warwick,\r\n    complaining of want of money for the prisoners: praying that while\r\n    he and his brother Commissioners adventure their persons and all\r\n    that is dear to them, in this uncomfortable service, they may not be\r\n    exposed to ruin, and to a necessity of abandoning their care; and\r\n    adding that they have lost their officers and servants by the\r\n    pestilence, and are hourly environed with the saddest objects of\r\n    perishing people. \"I have,\" says he, \"fifteen places full of sick\r\n    men, where they put me to unspeakable trouble; the magistrates and\r\n    justices, who should further us in our exigencies, hindering the\r\n    people from giving us quarters, jealous of the contagion, and\r\n    causing them to shut the doors at our approach.\"]\r\n\r\nHis employments, in connection with the repair of St. Paul's (which,\r\nhowever, occupied him but a brief time), as in the Commission of Trade\r\nand Plantations, and in the building of Greenwich Hospital, were much\r\nbetter adapted to his inclinations and pursuits.\r\n\r\nAs a Commissioner of the Privy Seal in the reign of King James II., he\r\nhad a difficult task to perform. He was most steadily attached to the\r\nChurch of England, and the King required the Seal to be affixed to many\r\nthings incompatible with the welfare of that Church. This, on some\r\noccasions, he refused to do, particularly to a license to Dr. Obadiah\r\nWalker to print Popish books;[3] and on other occasions he absented\r\nhimself, leaving it to his brother Commissioners to act as they thought\r\nfit. Such, however, was the King's estimation of him, that no displeasure\r\nwas evinced on this account.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: Dr. Walker had been a member of the Church of England,\r\n    but had renounced it, and turned Papist.]\r\n\r\nOf Evelyn's attempt to bring Colonel Morley (Cromwell's Lieutenant of the\r\nTower, immediately preceding the Restoration) over to the King's\r\ninterest, an imperfect account is given in the \"Biographia.\" The fact is,\r\nthat there was great friendship between these gentlemen, and Evelyn did\r\nendeavor to engage the Colonel in the King's interest. He saw him several\r\ntimes, and put his life into his hands by writing to him on 12th January,\r\n1659-60; he did not succeed, and Colonel Morley was too much his friend\r\nto betray him; but so far from the Colonel having settled matters\r\nprivately with Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper, or General Monk, as there\r\ndescribed, he was obliged, when the Restoration took place, actually to\r\napply to Evelyn to procure his pardon; who obtained it accordingly,\r\nthough, as he states, the Colonel was obliged to pay a large sum of money\r\nfor it. This could not have happened, if there had been any previous\r\nnegotiation with General Monk.\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell took some pains to vindicate Mr. Evelyn's book, entitled,\r\n\"Navigation and Commerce, their Origin and Progress,\" from the charge of\r\nbeing an imperfect work, unequal to the expectation excited by the title.\r\nBut the Doctor, who had not the information which this Journal so amply\r\naffords on this subject, was not aware that what was so printed was\r\nnothing more than an Introduction to the History of the Dutch War; a work\r\nundertaken by Evelyn at the express command of King Charles II., and the\r\nmaterials for which were furnished by the Officers of State. The\r\ncompletion of this work, after considerable progress had been made in it,\r\nwas put a stop to by the King himself, for what reason does not appear;\r\nbut perhaps it was found that Evelyn was inclined to tell too much of the\r\ntruth concerning a transaction, which it will be seen by his Journal that\r\nhe utterly reprobated. His copy of the History, as far as he had\r\nproceeded, he put into the hands of his friend, Mr. Pepys, of the\r\nAdmiralty, who did not return it; but the books and manuscripts belonging\r\nto Mr. Pepys passed into the possession of Magdalen College, Cambridge.\r\n\r\nFrom the numerous authors who have spoken in high terms of Mr. Evelyn, we\r\nwill select the two following notices of him.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Biographia Britannica\" Dr. Campbell says, \"It is certain that\r\nvery few authors who have written in our language deserve the character\r\nof able and agreeable writers so well as Mr. Evelyn, who, though he was\r\nacquainted with most sciences, and wrote upon many different subjects,\r\nyet was very far, indeed the farthest of most men of his time, from being\r\na superficial writer. He had genius, he had taste, he had learning; and\r\nhe knew how to give all these a proper place in his works, so as never to\r\npass for a pedant, even with such as were least in love with literature,\r\nand to be justly esteemed a polite author by those who knew it best.\"\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole (afterward Earl of Orford), in his Catalogue of Engravers,\r\ngives us the following admirably drawn character: \"If Mr. Evelyn had not\r\nbeen an artist himself, as I think I can prove he was, I should yet have\r\nfound it difficult to deny myself the pleasure of allotting him a place\r\namong the arts he loved, promoted, patronized; and it would be but\r\njustice to inscribe his name with due panegyric in these records, as I\r\nhave once or twice taken the liberty to criticise him. But they are\r\ntrifling blemishes compared with his amiable virtues and beneficence; and\r\nit may be remarked that the worst I have said of him is, that he knew\r\nmore than he always communicated. It is no unwelcome satire to say, that\r\na man's intelligence and philosophy is inexhaustible. I mean not to write\r\nhis biography, but I must observe, that his life, which was extended to\r\neighty-six years, was a course of inquiry, study, curiosity, instruction,\r\nand benevolence. The works of the Creator, and the minute labors of the\r\ncreature, were all objects of his pursuit. He unfolded the perfection of\r\nthe one, and assisted the imperfection of the other. He adored from\r\nexamination; was a courtier that flattered only by informing his Prince,\r\nand by pointing out what was worthy of him to countenance; and really was\r\nthe neighbor of the Gospel, for there was no man that might not have been\r\nthe better for him. Whoever peruses a list of his works will subscribe to\r\nmy assertion. He was one of the first promoters of the Royal Society; a\r\npatron of the ingenious and the indigent; and peculiarly serviceable to\r\nthe lettered world; for, besides his writings and discoveries, he\r\nobtained the Arundelian Marbles for the University of Oxford, and the\r\nArundelian Library for the Royal Society. Nor is it the least part of his\r\npraise, that he who proposed to Mr. Boyle the erection of a Philosophical\r\nCollege for retired and speculative persons, had the honesty to write in\r\ndefense of active life against Sir George Mackenzie's 'Essay on\r\nSolitude.' He knew that retirement, in his own hands, was industry and\r\nbenefit to mankind; but in those of others, laziness and inutility.\"\r\n\r\nEvelyn was buried in the Dormitory adjoining Wotton Church.\r\n\r\nOn a white marble, covering a tomb shaped like a coffin, raised about\r\nthree feet above the floor, is inscribed:\r\n\r\n                Here lies the Body\r\n              of JOHN EVELYN, Esq.,\r\n            of this place, second son\r\n             of Richard Evelyn, Esq.;\r\n          who having serv'd the Publick\r\n      in several employments, of which that\r\n     of Commissioner of the Privy-Seal in the\r\n       Reign of King James the 2d was most\r\n       honourable, and perpetuated his fame\r\n        by far more lasting monuments than\r\n       those of Stone or Brass, his learned\r\n    and usefull Works, fell asleep the 27 day\r\n      of February 1705-6, being the 86 year\r\n      of his age, in full hope of a glorious\r\n    Resurrection, thro' Faith in Jesus Christ.\r\n        Living in an age of extraordinary\r\n        Events and Revolutions, he learnt\r\n        (as himself asserted) this Truth,\r\n         which pursuant to his intention\r\n                is here declared--\r\n     _That all is vanity which is not honest,\r\n        and that there is no solid wisdom\r\n               but in real Piety._\r\n         Of five Sons and three Daughters\r\n            born to him from his most\r\n           vertuous and excellent Wife,\r\n         Mary, sole daughter and heiress\r\n           of Sir Rich.

My sister Eliza was born at nine at night, 28th\r\n    November, 1614; Jane at four in the morning, 16th February, 1616; my\r\n    brother George at nine at night, Wednesday, 18th June, 1617; and my\r\n    brother Richard, 9th November, 1622.--_Note by Evelyn._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WOTTON]\r\n\r\nMy father, named Richard, was of a sanguine complexion, mixed with a dash\r\nof choler: his hair inclining to light, which, though exceedingly thick,\r\nbecame hoary by the time he had attained to thirty years of age; it was\r\nsomewhat curled toward the extremities; his beard, which he wore a little\r\npeaked, as the mode was, of a brownish color, and so continued to the\r\nlast, save that it was somewhat mingled with gray hairs about his cheeks,\r\nwhich, with his countenance, were clear and fresh-colored; his eyes\r\nextraordinary quick and piercing; an ample forehead,--in sum, a very\r\nwell-composed visage and manly aspect: for the rest, he was but low of\r\nstature, yet very strong. He was, for his life, so exact and temperate,\r\nthat I have heard he had never been surprised by excess, being ascetic\r\nand sparing. His wisdom was great, and his judgment most acute; of solid\r\ndiscourse, affable, humble, and in nothing affected; of a thriving, neat,\r\nsilent, and methodical genius, discreetly severe, yet liberal upon all\r\njust occasions, both to his children, to strangers, and servants; a lover\r\nof hospitality; and, in brief, of a singular and Christian moderation in\r\nall his actions; not illiterate, nor obscure, as, having continued\r\nJustice of the Peace and of the Quorum, he served his country as High\r\nSheriff, being, as I take it, the last dignified with that office for\r\nSussex and Surrey together, the same year, before their separation. He\r\nwas yet a studious decliner of honors and titles; being already in that\r\nesteem with his country, that they could have added little to him besides\r\ntheir burden. He was a person of that rare conversation that, upon\r\nfrequent recollection, and calling to mind passages of his life and\r\ndiscourse, I could never charge him with the least passion, or\r\ninadvertency. His estate was esteemed about £4000 per annum, well wooded,\r\nand full of timber.\r\n\r\nMy mother's name was Eleanor, sole daughter and heiress of John\r\nStandsfield, Esq., of an ancient and honorable family (though now\r\nextinct) in Shropshire, by his wife Eleanor Comber, of a good and\r\nwell-known house in Sussex. She was of proper personage; of a brown\r\ncomplexion; her eyes and hair of a lovely black; of constitution more\r\ninclined to a religious melancholy, or pious sadness; of a rare memory,\r\nand most exemplary life; for economy and prudence, esteemed one of the\r\nmost conspicuous in her country: which rendered her loss much deplored,\r\nboth by those who knew, and such as only heard of her.\r\n\r\nThus much, in brief, touching my parents; nor was it reasonable I should\r\nspeak less of them to whom I owe so much.\r\n\r\nThe place of my birth was Wotton, in the parish of Wotton, or Blackheath,\r\nin the county of Surrey, the then mansion-house of my father, left him by\r\nmy grandfather, afterward and now my eldest brother's. It is situated in\r\nthe most southern part of the shire; and, though in a valley, yet really\r\nupon part of Leith Hill, one of the most eminent in England for the\r\nprodigious prospect to be seen from its summit, though by few observed.\r\nFrom it may be discerned twelve or thirteen counties, with part of the\r\nsea on the coast of Sussex, in a serene day. The house is large and\r\nancient, suitable to those hospitable times, and so sweetly environed\r\nwith those delicious streams and venerable woods, as in the judgment of\r\nstrangers as well as Englishmen it may be compared to one of the most\r\npleasant seats in the nation, and most tempting for a great person and a\r\nwanton purse to render it conspicuous. It has rising grounds, meadows,\r\nwoods, and water, in abundance.\r\n\r\nThe distance from London little more than twenty miles, and yet so\r\nsecurely placed, as if it were one hundred; three miles from Dorking,\r\nwhich serves it abundantly with provision as well of land as sea; six\r\nfrom Guildford, twelve from Kingston. I will say nothing of the air,\r\nbecause the pre-eminence is universally given to Surrey, the soil being\r\ndry and sandy; but I should speak much of the gardens, fountains, and\r\ngroves that adorn it, were they not as generally known to be among the\r\nmost natural, and (till this later and universal luxury of the whole\r\nnation, since abounding in such expenses) the most magnificent that\r\nEngland afforded; and which indeed gave one of the first examples to that\r\nelegancy, since so much in vogue, and followed in the managing of their\r\nwaters, and other elegancies of that nature. Let me add, the contiguity\r\nof five or six manors, the patronage of the livings about it, and what\r\nThemistocles pronounced for none of the least advantages--the good\r\nneighborhood. All which conspire here to render it an honorable and\r\nhandsome royalty, fit for the present possessor, my worthy brother, and\r\nhis noble lady, whose constant liberality gives them title both to the\r\nplace and the affections of all that know them. Thus, with the poet:\r\n\r\n    _Nescio quâ natale solum dulcedine cunctos\r\n    Ducit, et immemores non sinit esse sui._\r\n\r\nI had given me the name of my grandfather, my mother's father, who,\r\ntogether with a sister of Sir Thomas Evelyn, of Long Ditton, and Mr.\r\nComber, a near relation of my mother, were my susceptors. The solemnity\r\n(yet upon what accident I know not, unless some indisposition in me) was\r\nperformed in the dining-room by Parson Higham, the present incumbent of\r\nthe parish, according to the forms prescribed by the then glorious Church\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nI was now (in regard to my mother's weakness, or rather custom of persons\r\nof quality) put to nurse to one Peter, a neighbor's wife and tenant, of a\r\ngood, comely, brown, wholesome complexion, and in a most sweet place\r\ntoward the hills, flanked with wood and refreshed with streams; the\r\naffection to which kind of solitude I sucked in with my very milk. It\r\nappears, by a note of my father's, that I sucked till 17th of January,\r\n1622, or at least I came not home before.[5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: The whole of this passage, so characteristic of the\r\n    writer's tastes and genius, and both the paragraphs before and after\r\n    it, are printed for the first time in this edition. Portions of the\r\n    preceding description of Wotton are also first taken from the\r\n    original; and it may not be out of place to add that, more\r\n    especially in the first fifty pages of this volume, a very large\r\n    number of curious and interesting additions are made to Evelyn's\r\n    text from the Manuscript of the Diary at Wotton.]\r\n\r\n1623. The very first thing that I can call to memory, and from which time\r\nforward I began to observe, was this year (1623) my youngest brother,\r\nbeing in his nurse's arms, who, being then two days and nine months\r\nyounger than myself, was the last child of my dear parents.\r\n\r\n1624. I was not initiated into any rudiments until near four years of\r\nage, and then one Frier taught us at the church-porch of Wotton; and I do\r\nperfectly remember the great talk and stir about Il Conde Gondomar, now\r\nAmbassador from Spain (for near about this time was the match of our\r\nPrince with the Infanta proposed); and the effects of that comet, 1618,\r\nstill working in the prodigious revolutions now beginning in Europe,\r\nespecially in Germany, whose sad commotions sprang from the Bohemians'\r\ndefection from the Emperor Matthias; upon which quarrel the Swedes broke\r\nin, giving umbrage to the rest of the princes, and the whole Christian\r\nworld cause to deplore it, as never since enjoying perfect tranquillity.\r\n\r\n1625. I was this year (being the first of the reign of King Charles) sent\r\nby my father to Lewes, in Sussex, to be with my grandfather, Standsfield,\r\nwith whom I passed my childhood. This was the year in which the\r\npestilence was so epidemical, that there died in London 5,000 a week, and\r\nI well remember the strict watches and examinations upon the ways as we\r\npassed; and I was shortly after so dangerously sick of a fever that (as I\r\nhave heard) the physicians despaired of me.\r\n\r\n1626. My picture was drawn in oil by one Chanterell, no ill painter.\r\n\r\n1627. My grandfather, Standsfield, died this year, on the 5th of\r\nFebruary: I remember perfectly the solemnity at his funeral. He was\r\nburied in the parish church of All Souls, where my grandmother, his\r\nsecond wife, erected him a pious monument. About this time, was the\r\nconsecration of the Church of South Malling, near Lewes, by Dr. Field,\r\nBishop of Oxford (one Mr. Coxhall preached, who was afterward minister);\r\nthe building whereof was chiefly procured by my grandfather, who having\r\nthe impropriation, gave £20 a year out of it to this church. I afterward\r\nsold the impropriation. I laid one of the first stones at the building of\r\nthe church.\r\n\r\n1628-30. It was not till the year 1628, that I was put to learn my Latin\r\nrudiments, and to write, of one Citolin, a Frenchman, in Lewes. I very\r\nwell remember that general muster previous to the Isle of Rhè's\r\nexpedition, and that I was one day awakened in the morning with the news\r\nof the Duke of Buckingham being slain by that wretch, Felton, after our\r\ndisgrace before La Rochelle. And I now took so extraordinary a fancy to\r\ndrawing and designing, that I could never after wean my inclinations from\r\nit, to the expense of much precious time, which might have been more\r\nadvantageously employed. I was now put to school to one Mr. Potts, in the\r\nCliff at Lewes, from whom, on the 7th of January, 1630, being the day\r\nafter Epiphany, I went to the free-school at Southover, near the town, of\r\nwhich one Agnes Morley had been the foundress, and now Edward Snatt was\r\nthe master, under whom I remained till I was sent to the University.[6]\r\nThis year, my grandmother (with whom I sojourned) being married to one\r\nMr. Newton, a learned and most religious gentleman, we went from the\r\nCliff to dwell at his house in Southover. I do most perfectly remember\r\nthe jubilee which was universally expressed for the happy birth of the\r\nPrince of Wales, 29th of May, now Charles II., our most gracious\r\nSovereign.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: Long afterward, Evelyn was in the habit of paying great\r\n    respect to his old teacher.]\r\n\r\n1631. There happened now an extraordinary dearth in England, corn bearing\r\nan excessive price; and, in imitation of what I had seen my father do, I\r\nbegan to observe matters more punctually, which I did use to set down in\r\na blank almanac. The Lord of Castlehaven's arraignment for many shameful\r\nexorbitances was now all the talk, and the birth of the Princess Mary,\r\nafterward Princess of Orange.\r\n\r\n21st October, 1632. My eldest sister was married to Edward Darcy, Esq.,\r\nwho little deserved so excellent a person, a woman of so rare virtue. I\r\nwas not present at the nuptials; but I was soon afterward sent for into\r\nSurrey, and my father would willingly have weaned me from my fondness of\r\nmy too indulgent grandmother, intending to have placed me at Eton; but,\r\nnot being so provident for my own benefit, and unreasonably terrified\r\nwith the report of the severe discipline there, I was sent back to Lewes;\r\nwhich perverseness of mine I have since a thousand times deplored. This\r\nwas the first time that ever my parents had seen all their children\r\ntogether in prosperity. While I was now trifling at home, I saw London,\r\nwhere I lay one night only. The next day, I dined at Beddington, where I\r\nwas much delighted with the gardens and curiosities. Thence, we returned\r\nto the Lady Darcy's, at Sutton; thence to Wotton; and, on the 16th of\r\nAugust following, 1633, back to Lewes.\r\n\r\n3d November, 1633. This year my father was appointed Sheriff, the last,\r\nas I think, who served in that honorable office for Surrey and Sussex,\r\nbefore they were disjoined. He had 116 servants in liveries, every one\r\nliveried in green satin doublets; divers gentlemen and persons of quality\r\nwaited on him in the same garb and habit, which at that time (when thirty\r\nor forty was the usual retinue of the High Sheriff) was esteemed a great\r\nmatter. Nor was this out of the least vanity that my father exceeded (who\r\nwas one of the greatest decliners of it); but because he could not refuse\r\nthe civility of his friends and relations, who voluntarily came\r\nthemselves, or sent in their servants. But my father was afterward most\r\nunjustly and spitefully molested by that jeering judge, Richardson, for\r\nreprieving the execution of a woman, to gratify my Lord of Lindsey, then\r\nAdmiral: but out of this he emerged with as much honor as trouble. The\r\nking made this year his progress into Scotland, and Duke James was born.\r\n\r\n15th December, 1634: My dear sister, Darcy, departed this life, being\r\narrived to her 20th year of age; in virtue advanced beyond her years, or\r\nthe merit of her husband, the worst of men. She had been brought to bed\r\nthe 2d of June before, but the infant died soon after her, the 24th of\r\nDecember. I was therefore sent for home the second time, to celebrate the\r\nobsequies of my sister; who was interred in a very honorable manner in\r\nour dormitory joining to the parish church, where now her monument\r\nstands.\r\n\r\n1635. But my dear mother being now dangerously sick, I was, on the 3d of\r\nSeptember following, sent for to Wotton. Whom I found so far spent, that,\r\nall human assistance failing, she in a most heavenly manner departed this\r\nlife upon the 29th of the same month, about eight in the evening of\r\nMichaelmas-day. It was a malignant fever which took her away, about the\r\n37th of her age, and 22d of her marriage, to our irreparable loss and the\r\nregret of all that knew her. Certain it is, that the visible cause of her\r\nindisposition proceeded from grief upon the loss of her daughter, and the\r\ninfant that followed it; and it is as certain, that when she perceived\r\nthe peril whereto its excess had engaged her, she strove to compose\r\nherself and allay it; but it was too late, and she was forced to succumb.\r\nTherefore summoning all her children then living (I shall never forget\r\nit), she expressed herself in a manner so heavenly, with instructions so\r\npious and Christian, as made us strangely sensible of the extraordinary\r\nloss then imminent; after which, embracing every one of us she gave to\r\neach a ring with her blessing and dismissed us. Then, taking my father by\r\nthe hand, she recommended us to his care; and, because she was extremely\r\nzealous for the education of my younger brother, she requested my father\r\nthat he might be sent with me to Lewes; and so having importuned him that\r\nwhat he designed to bestow on her funeral, he would rather dispose among\r\nthe poor, she labored to compose herself for the blessed change which she\r\nnow expected. There was not a servant in the house whom she did not\r\nexpressly send for, advise, and infinitely affect with her counsel. Thus\r\nshe continued to employ her intervals, either instructing her relations,\r\nor preparing of herself.\r\n\r\nThough her physicians, Dr. Meverell, Dr. Clement, and Dr. Rand, had given\r\nover all hopes of her recovery, and Sir Sanders Duncombe had tried his\r\ncelebrated and famous powder, yet she was many days impairing, and\r\nendured the sharpest conflicts of her sickness with admirable patience\r\nand most Christian resignation, retaining both her intellectuals and\r\nardent affections for her dissolution, to the very article of her\r\ndeparture. When near her dissolution, she laid her hand on every one of\r\nher children; and taking solemn leave of my father, with elevated heart\r\nand eyes, she quietly expired, and resigned her soul to God. Thus ended\r\nthat prudent and pious woman, in the flower of her age, to the\r\ninconsolable affliction of her husband, irreparable loss of her children,\r\nand universal regret of all that knew her. She was interred, as near as\r\nmight be, to her daughter Darcy, the 3d of October, at night, but with no\r\nmean ceremony.\r\n\r\nIt was the 3d of the ensuing November, after my brother George was gone\r\nback to Oxford, ere I returned to Lewes, when I made way, according to\r\ninstructions received of my father, for my brother Richard, who was sent\r\nthe 12th after.\r\n\r\n1636. This year being extremely dry, the pestilence much increased in\r\nLondon, and divers parts of England.\r\n\r\n13th February, 1637: I was especially admitted (and, as I remember, my\r\nother brother) into the Middle Temple, London, though absent, and as yet\r\nat school. There were now large contributions to the distressed\r\nPalatinates.\r\n\r\nThe 10th of December my father sent a servant to bring us necessaries,\r\nand the plague beginning now to cease, on the 3d of April, 1637, I left\r\nschool, where, till about the last year, I have been extremely remiss in\r\nmy studies; so as I went to the University rather out of shame of abiding\r\nlonger at school, than for any fitness, as by sad experience I found:\r\nwhich put me to re-learn all that I had neglected, or but perfunctorily\r\ngained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OXFORD]\r\n\r\n10th May, 1637. I was admitted a Fellow-commoner of Baliol College,\r\nOxford; and, on the 29th, I was matriculated in the vestry of St. Mary's,\r\nwhere I subscribed the Articles, and took the oaths: Dr. Baily, head of\r\nSt. John's, being vice-chancellor, afterward bishop. It appears by a\r\nletter of my father's, that he was upon treaty with one Mr. Bathurst\r\n(afterward Doctor and President), of Trinity College, who should have\r\nbeen my tutor; but, lest my brother's tutor, Dr. Hobbs, more zealous in\r\nhis life than industrious to his pupils, should receive it as an affront,\r\nand especially for that Fellow-commoners in Baliol were no more exempt\r\nfrom exercise than the meanest scholars there, my father sent me thither\r\nto one Mr. George Bradshaw (_nomen invisum!_ yet the son of an excellent\r\nfather, beneficed in Surrey). I ever thought my tutor had parts enough;\r\nbut as his ambition made him much suspected of the College, so his grudge\r\nto Dr. Lawrence, the governor of it (whom he afterward supplanted), took\r\nup so much of his time, that he seldom or never had the opportunity to\r\ndischarge his duty to his scholars. This I perceiving, associated myself\r\nwith one Mr. James Thicknesse (then a young man of the foundation,\r\nafterward a Fellow of the house), by whose learned and friendly\r\nconversation I received great advantage. At my first arrival, Dr.\r\nParkhurst was master: and after his decease, Dr. Lawrence, a chaplain of\r\nhis Majesty's and Margaret Professor, succeeded, an acute and learned\r\nperson; nor do I much reproach his severity, considering that the\r\nextraordinary remissness of discipline had (till his coming) much\r\ndetracted from the reputation of that College.\r\n\r\nThere came in my time to the College one Nathaniel Conopios, out of\r\nGreece, from Cyrill, the patriarch of Constantinople, who, returning many\r\nyears after, was made (as I understand) Bishop of Smyrna. He was the\r\nfirst I ever saw drink coffee; which custom came not into England till\r\nthirty years after.[7]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: Evelyn should have said \"till twenty years after,\" not\r\n    thirty. Coffee was introduced into England, and coffee-houses set\r\n    up, in 1658.]\r\n\r\nAfter I was somewhat settled there in my formalities (for then was the\r\nUniversity exceedingly regular, under the exact discipline of William\r\nLaud, Archbishop of Canterbury, then Chancellor), I added, as benefactor\r\nto the library of the College, these books--\"_ex dono Johannis Evelyni,\r\nhujus Coll. Socio-Commensalis, filii Richardi Evelyni, è com. Surriæ,\r\narmig^r_.\"--\r\n\r\n\"_Zanchii Opera_,\" vols. 1, 2, 3.\r\n\r\n\"_Granado in Thomam Aquinatem_,\" vols. 1, 2, 3.\r\n\r\n\"_Novarini Electa Sacra_\" and \"_Cresolii Anthologia Sacra_\"; authors, it\r\nseems, much desired by the students of divinity there.\r\n\r\nUpon the 2d of July, being the first Sunday of the month, I first\r\nreceived the blessed Sacrament of the Lord's Supper in the college\r\nchapel, one Mr. Cooper, a Fellow of the house, preaching; and at this\r\ntime was the Church of England in her greatest splendor, all things\r\ndecent, and becoming the Peace, and the persons that governed. The most\r\nof the following week I spent in visiting the Colleges, and several\r\nrarities of the University, which do very much affect young comers.\r\n\r\n18th July, 1637. I accompanied my eldest brother, who then quitted\r\nOxford, into the country; and, on the 9th of August, went to visit my\r\nfriends at Lewes, whence I returned the 12th to Wotton. On the 17th of\r\nSeptember, I received the blessed Sacrament at Wotton church, and 23d of\r\nOctober went back to Oxford.\r\n\r\n5th November, 1637. I received again the Holy Communion in our college\r\nchapel, one Prouse, a Fellow (but a mad one), preaching.\r\n\r\n9th December, 1637. I offered at my first exercise in the Hall, and\r\nanswered my opponent; and, upon the 11th following, declaimed in the\r\nchapel before the Master, Fellows, and Scholars, according to the custom.\r\nThe 15th after, I first of all opposed in the Hall.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas ensuing, being at a Comedy which the gentlemen of Exeter\r\nCollege presented to the University, and standing, for the better\r\nadvantage of seeing, upon a table in the Hall, which was near to another,\r\nin the dark, being constrained by the extraordinary press to quit my\r\nstation, in leaping down to save myself I dashed my right leg with such\r\nviolence against the sharp edge of the other board, as gave me a hurt\r\nwhich held me in cure till almost Easter, and confined me to my study.\r\n\r\n22d January, 1638. I would needs be admitted into the dancing and\r\nvaulting schools; of which late activity one Stokes, the master, did\r\nafterward set forth a pretty book, which was published, with many witty\r\nelogies before it.\r\n\r\n4th February, 1638. One Mr. Wariner preached in our chapel; and, on the\r\n25th, Mr. Wentworth, a kinsman of the Earl of Strafford; after which\r\nfollowed the blessed Sacrament.\r\n\r\n13th April, 1638. My father ordered that I should begin to manage my own\r\nexpenses, which till then my tutor had done; at which I was much\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTSMOUTH]\r\n\r\n9th July, 1638. I went home to visit my friends, and, on the 26th, with\r\nmy brother and sister to Lewes, where we abode till the 31st; and thence\r\nto one Mr. Michael's, of Houghton, near Arundel, where we were very well\r\ntreated; and, on the 2d of August, to Portsmouth, and thence, having\r\nsurveyed the fortifications (a great rarity in that blessed halcyon time\r\nin England), we passed into the Isle of Wight, to the house of my Lady\r\nRichards, in a place called Yaverland; but were turned the following day\r\nto Chichester, where, having viewed the city and fair cathedral, we\r\nreturned home.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of September, I was so afflicted with a quartan ague,\r\nthat I could by no means get rid of it till the December following. This\r\nwas the fatal year wherein the rebellious Scots opposed the King, upon\r\nthe pretense of the introduction of some new ceremonies and the Book of\r\nCommon Prayer, and madly began our confusions, and their own destruction,\r\ntoo, as it proved in event.\r\n\r\n14th January, 1639. I came back to Oxford, after my tedious\r\nindisposition, and to the infinite loss of my time; and now I began to\r\nlook upon the rudiments of music, in which I afterward arrived to some\r\nformal knowledge, though to small perfection of hand, because I was so\r\nfrequently diverted with inclinations to newer trifles.\r\n\r\n20th May, 1639. Accompanied with one Mr. J. Crafford (who afterward being\r\nmy fellow-traveler in Italy, there changed his religion), I took a\r\njourney of pleasure to see the Somersetshire baths, Bristol, Cirencester,\r\nMalmesbury, Abington, and divers other towns of lesser note; and returned\r\nthe 25th.\r\n\r\n8th October, 1639. I went back to Oxford.\r\n\r\n14th December, 1639. According to injunctions from the Heads of Colleges,\r\nI went (among the rest) to the Confirmation at St. Mary's, where, after\r\nsermon, the Bishop of Oxford laid his hands upon us, with the usual form\r\nof benediction prescribed: but this received (I fear) for the more part\r\nout of curiosity, rather than with that due preparation and advice which\r\nhad been requisite, could not be so effectual as otherwise that admirable\r\nand useful institution might have been, and as I have since deplored it.\r\n\r\n21st January, 1640. Came my brother, Richard, from school, to be my\r\nchamber-fellow at the University. He was admitted the next day and\r\nmatriculated the 31st.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n11th April, 1640. I went to London to see the solemnity of his Majesty's\r\nriding through the city in state to the Short Parliament, which began the\r\n13th following,--a very glorious and magnificent sight, the King circled\r\nwith his royal diadem and the affections of his people: but the day after\r\nI returned to Wotton again, where I stayed, my father's indisposition\r\nsuffering great intervals, till April 27th, when I was sent to London to\r\nbe first resident at the Middle Temple: so as my being at the University,\r\nin regard of these avocations, was of very small benefit to me. Upon May\r\nthe 5th following, was the Parliament unhappily dissolved; and, on the\r\n20th I returned with my brother George to Wotton, who, on the 28th of the\r\nsame month, was married at Albury to Mrs. Caldwell (an heiress of an\r\nancient Leicestershire family, where part of the nuptials were\r\ncelebrated).\r\n\r\n10th June, 1640. I repaired with my brother to the term, to go into our\r\nnew lodgings (that were formerly in Essex-court), being a very handsome\r\napartment just over against the Hall-court, but four pair of stairs high,\r\nwhich gave us the advantage of the fairer prospect; but did not much\r\ncontribute to the love of that impolished study, to which (I suppose) my\r\nfather had designed me, when he paid £145 to purchase our present lives,\r\nand assignments afterward.\r\n\r\nLondon, and especially the Court, were at this period in frequent\r\ndisorders, and great insolences were committed by the abused and too\r\nhappy City: in particular, the Bishop of Canterbury's Palace at Lambeth\r\nwas assaulted by a rude rabble from Southwark, my Lord Chamberlain\r\nimprisoned and many scandalous libels and invectives scattered about the\r\nstreets, to the reproach of Government, and the fermentation of our since\r\ndistractions: so that, upon the 25th of June, I was sent for to Wotton,\r\nand the 27th after, my father's indisposition augmenting, by advice of\r\nthe physicians he repaired to the Bath.\r\n\r\n7th July, 1640. My brother George and I, understanding the peril my\r\nfather was in upon a sudden attack of his infirmity, rode post from\r\nGuildford toward him, and found him extraordinary weak; yet so as that,\r\ncontinuing his course, he held out till the 8th of September, when I\r\nreturned home with him in his litter.\r\n\r\n15th October, 1640. I went to the Temple, it being Michaelmas Term.\r\n\r\n30th December, 1640. I saw his Majesty (coming from his Northern\r\nExpedition) ride in pomp and a kind of ovation, with all the marks of a\r\nhappy peace, restored to the affections of his people, being conducted\r\nthrough London with a most splendid cavalcade; and on the 3d of November\r\nfollowing (a day never to be mentioned without a curse), to that long\r\nungrateful, foolish, and fatal Parliament, the beginning of all our\r\nsorrows for twenty years after, and the period of the most happy monarch\r\nin the world: _Quis talia fando!_\r\n\r\nBut my father being by this time entered into a dropsy, an indisposition\r\nthe most unsuspected, being a person so exemplarily temperate, and of\r\nadmirable regimen, hastened me back to Wotton, December the 12th; where,\r\nthe 24th following, between twelve and one o'clock at noon, departed this\r\nlife that excellent man and indulgent parent, retaining his senses and\r\npiety to the last, which he most tenderly expressed in blessing us, whom\r\nhe now left to the world and the worst of times, while he was taken from\r\nthe evil to come.\r\n\r\n1641. It was a sad and lugubrious beginning of the year, when on the 2d\r\nof January, 1640-1, we at night followed the mourning hearse to the\r\nchurch at Wotton; when, after a sermon and funeral oration by the\r\nminister, my father was interred near his formerly erected monument, and\r\nmingled with the ashes of our mother, his dear wife. Thus we were bereft\r\nof both our parents in a period when we most of all stood in need of\r\ntheir counsel and assistance, especially myself, of a raw, vain,\r\nuncertain, and very unwary inclination: but so it pleased God to make\r\ntrial of my conduct in a conjuncture of the greatest and most prodigious\r\nhazard that ever the youth of England saw; and, if I did not amidst all\r\nthis impeach my liberty nor my virtue with the rest who made shipwreck of\r\nboth, it was more the infinite goodness and mercy of God than the least\r\nprovidence or discretion of mine own, who now thought of nothing but the\r\npursuit of vanity, and the confused imaginations of young men.\r\n\r\n15th April, 1641. I repaired to London to hear and see the famous trial\r\nof the Earl of Strafford, Lord-Deputy of Ireland, who, on the 22d of\r\nMarch, had been summoned before both Houses of Parliament, and now\r\nappeared in Westminster-hall,[8] which was prepared with scaffolds for\r\nthe Lords and Commons, who, together with the King, Queen, Prince, and\r\nflower of the noblesse, were spectators and auditors of the greatest\r\nmalice and the greatest innocency that ever met before so illustrous an\r\nassembly. It was Thomas, Earl of Arundel and Surrey, Earl Marshal of\r\nEngland, who was made High Steward upon this occasion; and the sequel is\r\ntoo well known to need any notice of the event.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: On the 15th of April Strafford made his eloquent\r\n    defense, which it seems to have been Evelyn's good fortune to be\r\n    present at. And here the reader may remark the fact, not without\r\n    significance, that between the entries on this page of the Diary\r\n    which relate to Lord Strafford, the young Prince of Orange came over\r\n    to make love to the Princess Royal, then twelve years old; and that\r\n    the marriage was subsequently celebrated amid extraordinary Court\r\n    rejoicings and festivities, in which the King took a prominent part,\r\n    during the short interval which elapsed between the sentence and\r\n    execution of the King's great and unfortunate minister.]\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of April, came over out of Holland the young Prince of\r\nOrange, with a splendid equipage, to make love to his Majesty's eldest\r\ndaughter, the now Princess Royal.\r\n\r\nThat evening, was celebrated the pompous funeral of the Duke of Richmond,\r\nwho was carried in effigy, with all the ensigns of that illustrious\r\nfamily, in an open chariot, in great solemnity, through London to\r\nWestminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of May, I beheld on Tower-hill the fatal stroke which severed\r\nthe wisest head in England from the shoulders of the Earl of Strafford,\r\nwhose crime coming under the cognizance of no human law or statute, a new\r\none was made, not to be a precedent, but his destruction. With what\r\nreluctancy the King signed the execution, he has sufficiently expressed;\r\nto which he imputes his own unjust suffering--to such exorbitancy were\r\nthings arrived.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of May, I returned to Wotton; and, on the 28th of June, I\r\nwent to London with my sister, Jane, and the day after sat to one\r\nVanderborcht for my picture in oil, at Arundel-house, whose servant that\r\nexcellent painter was, brought out of Germany when the Earl returned from\r\nVienna (whither he was sent Ambassador-extraordinary, with great pomp and\r\ncharge, though without any effect, through the artifice of the Jesuited\r\nSpaniard who governed all in that conjuncture). With Vanderborcht, the\r\npainter, he brought over Winceslaus Hollar, the sculptor, who engraved\r\nnot only the unhappy Deputy's trial in Westminster-hall, but his\r\ndecapitation; as he did several other historical things, then relating to\r\nthe accidents happening during the Rebellion in England, with great\r\nskill; besides many cities, towns, and landscapes, not only of this\r\nnation, but of foreign parts, and divers portraits of famous persons then\r\nin being; and things designed from the best pieces of the rare paintings\r\nand masters of which the Earl of Arundel was possessor, purchased and\r\ncollected in his travels with incredible expense: so as, though Hollar's\r\nwere but etched in aquafortis, I account the collection to be the most\r\nauthentic and useful extant. Hollar was the son of a gentleman near\r\nPrague, in Bohemia, and my very good friend, perverted at last by the\r\nJesuits at Antwerp to change his religion; a very honest, simple,\r\nwell-meaning man, who at last came over again into England, where he\r\ndied. We have the whole history of the king's reign, from his trial in\r\nWestminster-hall and before, to the restoration of King Charles II.,\r\nrepresented in several sculptures, with that also of Archbishop Laud, by\r\nthis indefatigable artist; besides innumerable sculptures in the works of\r\nDugdale, Ashmole, and other historical and useful works. I am the more\r\nparticular upon this for the fruit of that collection, which I wish I had\r\nentire.\r\n\r\nThis picture[9] I presented to my sister, being at her request, on my\r\nresolution to absent myself from this ill face of things at home, which\r\ngave umbrage to wiser than myself that the medal was reversing, and our\r\ncalamities but yet in their infancy: so that, on the 15th of July, having\r\nprocured a pass at the Custom-house, where I repeated my oath of\r\nallegiance, I went from London to Gravesend, accompanied with one Mr.\r\nCaryll, a Surrey gentleman, and our servants, where we arrived by six\r\no'clock that evening, with a purpose to take the first opportunity of a\r\npassage for Holland. But the wind as yet not favorable, we had time to\r\nview the Block-house of that town, which answered to another over against\r\nit at Tilbury, famous for the rendezvous of Queen Elizabeth, in the year\r\n1588, which we found stored with twenty pieces of cannon, and other\r\nammunition proportionable. On the 19th of July, we made a short excursion\r\nto Rochester, and having seen the cathedral went to Chatham to see the\r\nRoyal Sovereign, a glorious vessel of burden lately built there, being\r\nfor defense and ornament, the richest that ever spread cloth before the\r\nwind. She carried an hundred brass cannon, and was 1,200 tons; a rare\r\nsailer, the work of the famous Phineas Pett, inventor of the\r\nfrigate-fashion of building, to this day practiced. But what is to be\r\ndeplored as to this vessel is, that it cost his Majesty the affections of\r\nhis subjects, perverted by the malcontent of great ones, who took\r\noccasion to quarrel for his having raised a very slight tax for the\r\nbuilding of this, and equipping the rest of the navy, without an act of\r\nParliament; though, by the suffrages of the major part of the Judges the\r\nKing might legally do in times of imminent danger, of which his Majesty\r\nwas best apprised. But this not satisfying a jealous party, it was\r\ncondemned as unprecedented, and not justifiable as to the Royal\r\nprerogative; and, accordingly, the Judges were removed out of their\r\nplaces, fined, and imprisoned.[10]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: His own portrait.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: In such manner Evelyn refers to the tax of Ship-money.\r\n    But compare this remarkable passage, now first printed from the\r\n    original, with the tone in which, eight years later, he spoke of the\r\n    only chance by which monarchy in England might be saved; namely,\r\n    that of \"doing nothing as to government but what shall be approved\r\n    by the old way of a free parliament, and the known laws of the\r\n    land.\"]\r\n\r\nWe returned again this evening, and on the 21st of July embarked in a\r\nDutch frigate, bound for Flushing, convoyed and accompanied by five other\r\nstout vessels, whereof one was a man-of-war. The next day at noon, we\r\nlanded at Flushing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DE VERE]\r\n\r\nBeing desirous to overtake the Leagure,[11] which was then before Genep,\r\nere the summer should be too far spent, we went this evening from\r\nFlushing to Middleburg, another fine town in this island, to De Vere,\r\nwhence the most ancient and illustrious Earls of Oxford derive their\r\nfamily, who have spent so much blood in assisting the state during their\r\nwars. From De Vere we passed over many towns, houses, and ruins of\r\ndemolished suburbs, etc., which have formerly been swallowed up by the\r\nsea; at what time no less than eight of those islands had been\r\nirrecoverably lost.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: The meaning of this expression is, that they should be\r\n    in time to witness the siege.]\r\n\r\nThe next day we arrived at Dort, the first town of Holland, furnished\r\nwith all German commodities, and especially Rhenish wines and timber. It\r\nhath almost at the extremity a very spacious and venerable church; a\r\nstately senate house, wherein was holden that famous synod against the\r\nArminians in 1618; and in that hall hangeth a picture of \"The Passion,\"\r\nan exceeding rare and much-esteemed piece.\r\n\r\nFrom Dort, being desirous to hasten toward the army, I took wagon this\r\nafternoon to Rotterdam, whither we were hurried in less than an hour,\r\nthough it be ten miles distant; so furiously do those Foremen drive. I\r\nwent first to visit the great church, the Doole, the Bourse, and the\r\npublic statue of the learned Erasmus, of brass. They showed us his house,\r\nor rather the mean cottage, wherein he was born, over which there are\r\nextant these lines, in capital letters:\r\n\r\n    ÆDIBUS HIS ORTUS, MUNDUM DECORAVIT ERASMUS\r\n       ARTIBUS INGENIO, RELIGIONE, FIDE.\r\n\r\nThe 26th of July I passed by a straight and commodious river through\r\nDelft to the Hague; in which journey I observed divers leprous poor\r\ncreatures dwelling in solitary huts on the brink of the water, and\r\npermitted to ask the charity of passengers, which is conveyed to them in\r\na floating box that they cast out.\r\n\r\nArrived at the Hague, I went first to the Queen of Bohemia's court, where\r\nI had the honor to kiss her Majesty's hand, and several of the\r\nPrincesses', her daughters. Prince Maurice was also there, newly come out\r\nof Germany; and my Lord Finch, not long before fled out of England from\r\nthe fury of the Parliament. It was a fasting day with the Queen for the\r\nunfortunate death of her husband, and the presence chamber had been hung\r\nwith black velvet ever since his decease.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NIMEGUEN]\r\n\r\nThe 28th of July I went to Leyden; and the 29th to Utrecht, being thirty\r\nEnglish miles distant (as they reckon by hours). It was now Kermas, or a\r\nfair, in this town, the streets swarming with boors and rudeness, so\r\nthat early the next morning, having visited the ancient Bishop's court,\r\nand the two famous churches, I satisfied my curiosity till my return, and\r\nbetter leisure. We then came to Rynen, where the Queen of Bohemia hath a\r\nneat and well built palace, or country house, after the Italian manner,\r\nas I remember; and so, crossing the Rhine, upon which this villa is\r\nsituated, lodged that night in a countryman's house. The 31st to\r\nNimeguen; and on the 2d of August we arrived at the Leagure, where was\r\nthen the whole army encamped about Genep, a very strong castle situated\r\non the river Waal; but, being taken four or five days before, we had only\r\na sight of the demolitions. The next Sunday was the thanksgiving sermons\r\nperformed in Colonel Goring's regiment (eldest son of the since Earl of\r\nNorwich) by Mr. Goffe, his chaplain (now turned Roman, and\r\nfather-confessor to the Queen-mother). The evening was spent in firing\r\ncannon and other expressions of military triumphs.\r\n\r\nNow, according to the compliment, I was received a volunteer in the\r\ncompany of Captain Apsley, of whose Captain-lieutenant, Honywood (Apsley\r\nbeing absent), I received many civilities.\r\n\r\nThe 3d of August, at night, we rode about the lines of circumvallation,\r\nthe general being then in the field. The next day I was accommodated with\r\na very spacious and commodious tent for my lodging; as before I was with\r\na horse, which I had at command, and a hut which during the excessive\r\nheats was a great convenience; for the sun piercing the canvas of the\r\ntent, it was during the day unsufferable, and at night not seldom\r\ninfested with mists and fogs, which ascended from the river.\r\n\r\n6th August, 1641. As the turn came about, we were ordered to watch on a\r\nhorn-work near our quarters, and trail a pike, being the next morning\r\nrelieved by a company of French. This was our continual duty till the\r\ncastle was refortified, and all danger of quitting that station secured;\r\nwhence I went to see a Convent of Franciscan Friars, not far from our\r\nquarters, where we found both the chapel and refectory full, crowded with\r\nthe goods of such poor people as at the approach of the army had fled\r\nwith them thither for sanctuary. On the day following, I went to view all\r\nthe trenches, approaches, and mines, etc. of the besiegers; and, in\r\nparticular, I took special notice of the wheel-bridge, which engine his\r\nExcellency had made to run over the moat when they stormed the castle; as\r\nit is since described (with all the other particulars of this siege) by\r\nthe author of that incomparable work, \"Hollandia Illustrata.\" The walls\r\nand ramparts of earth, which a mine had broken and crumbled, were of\r\nprodigious thickness.\r\n\r\nUpon the 8th of August, I dined in the horse-quarters with Sir Robert\r\nStone and his lady, Sir William Stradling, and divers Cavaliers; where\r\nthere was very good cheer, but hot service for a young drinker, as then I\r\nwas; so that, being pretty well satisfied with the confusion of armies\r\nand sieges (if such that of the United Provinces may be called, where\r\ntheir quarters and encampments are so admirably regular, and orders so\r\nexactly observed, as few cities, the best governed in time of peace,\r\nexceed it for all conveniences), I took my leave of the Leagure and\r\nCamerades; and, on the 12th of August, I embarked on the \"Waal,\" in\r\ncompany with three grave divines, who entertained us a great part of our\r\npassage with a long dispute concerning the lawfulness of church-music. We\r\nnow sailed by Teil, where we landed some of our freight; and about five\r\no'clock we touched at a pretty town named Bommell, that had divers\r\nEnglish in garrison. It stands upon Contribution-land, which subjects the\r\nenvirons to the Spanish incursions. We sailed also by an exceeding strong\r\nfort called Lovestein, famous for the escape of the learned Hugo Grotius,\r\nwho, being in durance as a capital offender, as was the unhappy\r\nBarneveldt, by the stratagem of his lady, was conveyed in a trunk\r\nsupposed to be filled with books only. We lay at Gorcum, a very strong\r\nand considerable frontier.\r\n\r\n13th August, 1641. We arrived late at Rotterdam, where was their annual\r\nmart or fair, so furnished with pictures (especially landscapes and\r\ndrolleries, as they call those clownish representations), that I was\r\namazed. Some of these I bought and sent into England. The reason of this\r\nstore of pictures, and their cheapness, proceeds from their want of land\r\nto employ their stock, so that it is an ordinary thing to find a common\r\nfarmer lay out two or three thousand pounds in this commodity. Their\r\nhouses are full of them, and they vend them at their fairs to very great\r\ngains. Here I first saw an elephant, who was extremely well disciplined\r\nand obedient. It was a beast of a monstrous size, yet as flexible and\r\nnimble in the joints, contrary to the vulgar tradition, as could be\r\nimagined from so prodigious a bulk and strange fabric; but I most of all\r\nadmired the dexterity and strength of its proboscis, on which it was able\r\nto support two or three men, and by which it took and reached whatever\r\nwas offered to it; its teeth were but short, being a female, and not old.\r\nI was also shown a pelican, or _onocratulas_ of Pliny, with its large\r\ngullets, in which he kept his reserve of fish; the plumage was white,\r\nlegs red, flat, and film-footed, likewise a cock with four legs, two\r\nrumps and vents: also a hen which had two large spurs growing out of her\r\nsides, penetrating the feathers of her wings.\r\n\r\n17th August, 1641. I passed again through Delft, and visited the church\r\nin which was the monument of Prince William of Nassau,--the first of the\r\nWilliams, and savior (as they call him) of their liberty, which cost him\r\nhis life by a vile assassination. It is a piece of rare art, consisting\r\nof several figures, as big as the life, in copper. There is in the same\r\nplace a magnificent tomb of his son and successor, Maurice. The\r\nsenate-house hath a very stately portico, supported with choice columns\r\nof black marble, as I remember, of one entire stone. Within, there hangs\r\na weighty vessel of wood, not unlike a butter-churn, which the\r\nadventurous woman that hath two husbands at one time is to wear on her\r\nshoulders, her head peeping out at the top only, and so led about the\r\ntown, as a penance for her incontinence. From hence, we went the next day\r\nto Ryswick, a stately country-house of the Prince of Orange, for nothing\r\nmore remarkable than the delicious walks planted with lime trees, and the\r\nmodern paintings within.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HAGUE]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AMSTERDAM]\r\n\r\n19th August, 1641. We returned to the Hague, and went to visit the Hoff,\r\nor Prince's Court, with the adjoining gardens full of ornament, close\r\nwalks, statues, marbles, grots, fountains, and artificial music. There is\r\nto this palace a stately hall, not much inferior to ours of Westminster,\r\nhung round with colors and other trophies taken from the Spaniards;[12]\r\nand the sides below are furnished with shops. Next day (the 20th) I\r\nreturned to Delft, thence to Rotterdam, the Hague, and Leyden, where\r\nimmediately I mounted a wagon, which that night, late as it was, brought\r\nus to Haerlem. About seven in the morning after I came to Amsterdam,\r\nwhere being provided with a lodging, the first thing I went to see was a\r\nSynagogue of the Jews (being Saturday), whose ceremonies, ornaments,\r\nlamps, law, and schools, afforded matter for my contemplation. The women\r\nwere secluded from the men, being seated in galleries above, shut with\r\nlattices, having their heads muffled with linen, after a fantastical and\r\nsomewhat extraordinary fashion; the men, wearing a large calico mantle,\r\nyellow colored, over their hats, all the while waving their bodies, while\r\nat their devotions. From thence, I went to a place without the town,\r\ncalled Overkirk, where they have a spacious field assigned them to bury\r\ntheir dead, full of sepulchers with Hebraic inscriptions, some of them\r\nstately and costly. Looking through one of these monuments, where the\r\nstones were disjointed, I perceived divers books and papers lie about a\r\ncorpse; for it seems, when any learned Rabbi dies, they bury some of his\r\nbooks with him. With the help of a stick, I raked out several, written in\r\nHebrew characters, but much impaired. As we returned, we stepped in to\r\nsee the Spin-house, a kind of bridewell, where incorrigible and lewd\r\nwomen are kept in discipline and labor, but all neat. We were shown an\r\nhospital for poor travelers and pilgrims, built by Queen Elizabeth of\r\nEngland; and another maintained by the city.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: Westminster hall used to be so in Term time, and\r\n    during the sitting of Parliament, as late as the beginning of the\r\n    reign of George III.]\r\n\r\nThe State or Senate-house of this town, if the design be perfected, will\r\nbe one of the most costly and magnificent pieces of architecture in\r\nEurope, especially for the materials and the carvings. In the Doole is\r\npainted, on a very large table, the bust of Marie de Medicis, supported\r\nby four royal diadems, the work of one Vanderdall, who hath set his name\r\nthereon, 1st September, 1638.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, I heard an English sermon at the Presbyterian congregation,\r\nwhere they had chalked upon a slate the psalms that were to be sung, so\r\nthat all the congregation might see them without the bidding of a clerk.\r\nI was told, that after such an age no minister was permitted to preach,\r\nbut had his maintenance continued during life.\r\n\r\nI purposely changed my lodgings, being desirous to converse with the\r\nsectaries that swarmed in this city, out of whose spawn came those almost\r\ninnumerable broods in England afterward. It was at a Brownist's house,\r\nwhere we had an extraordinary good table. There was in pension with us my\r\nLord Keeper, Finch, and one Sir J. Fotherbee. Here I also found an\r\nEnglish Carmelite, who was going through Germany with an Irish gentleman.\r\nI now went to see the Weese-house, a foundation like our Charter-house,\r\nfor the education of decayed persons, orphans, and poor children, where\r\nthey are taught several occupations. The girls are so well brought up to\r\nhousewifery, that men of good worth, who seek that chiefly in a woman,\r\nfrequently take their wives from this hospital. Thence to the Rasp-house,\r\nwhere the lusty knaves are compelled to work; and the rasping of brasil\r\nand logwood for the dyers is very hard labor. To the Dool-house, for\r\nmadmen and fools. But none did I so much admire, as an Hospital for their\r\nlame and decrepit soldiers and seamen, where the accommodations are very\r\ngreat, the building answerable; and, indeed, for the like public\r\ncharities the provisions are admirable in this country, where, as no idle\r\nvagabonds are suffered (as in England they are), there is hardly a child\r\nof four or five years old, but they find some employment for it.\r\n\r\nIt was on a Sunday morning that I went to the Bourse, or Exchange, after\r\ntheir sermons were ended, to see the Dog-market, which lasts till two in\r\nthe afternoon, in this place of convention of merchants from all parts of\r\nthe world. The building is not comparable to that of London, built by\r\nthat worthy citizen, Sir Thomas Gresham, yet in one respect exceeding it,\r\nthat vessels of considerable burden ride at the very quay contiguous to\r\nit; and indeed it is by extraordinary industry that as well this city, as\r\ngenerally all the towns of Holland, are so accommodated with graffs,\r\ncuts, sluices, moles, and rivers, made by hand, that nothing is more\r\nfrequent than to see a whole navy, belonging to this mercantile people,\r\nriding at anchor before their very doors: and yet their streets even,\r\nstraight, and well paved, the houses so uniform and planted with lime\r\ntrees, as nothing can be more beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe next day we were entertained at a kind of tavern, called the\r\nBriloft, appertaining to a rich Anabaptist, where, in the upper rooms of\r\nthe house, were divers pretty waterworks, rising 108 feet from the\r\nground. Here were many quaint devices, fountains, artificial music,\r\nnoises of beasts, and chirping of birds; but what pleased me most was a\r\nlarge pendant candlestick, branching into several sockets, furnished all\r\nwith ordinary candles to appearance, out of the wicks spouting out\r\nstreams of water, instead of flames. This seemed then and was a rarity,\r\nbefore the philosophy of compressed air made it intelligible. There was\r\nlikewise a cylinder that entertained the company with a variety of\r\nchimes, the hammers striking upon the brims of porcelain dishes, suited\r\nto the tones and notes, without cracking any of them. Many other\r\nwaterworks were shown.\r\n\r\nThe Kaiser's or Emperor's Graft, which is an ample and long street,\r\nappearing like a city in a forest; the lime trees planted just before\r\neach house, and at the margin of that goodly aqueduct so curiously\r\nwharfed with Klincard brick, which likewise paves the streets, than which\r\nnothing can be more useful and neat. This part of Amsterdam is built and\r\ngained upon the main sea, supported by piles at an immense charge, and\r\nfitted for the most busy concourse of traffickers and people of commerce\r\nbeyond any place, or mart, in the world. Nor must I forget the port of\r\nentrance into an issue of this town, composed of very magnificent pieces\r\nof architecture, some of the ancient and best manner, as are divers\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nThe turrets, or steeples, are adorned after a particular manner and\r\ninvention; the chimes of bells are so rarely managed, that being curious\r\nto know whether the motion was from any engine, I went up to that of St.\r\nNicholas, where I found one who played all sorts of compositions from the\r\ntablature before him, as if he had fingered an organ; for so were the\r\nhammers fastened with wires to several keys put into a frame twenty feet\r\nbelow the bells, upon which (by the help of a wooden instrument, not much\r\nunlike a weaver's shuttle, that guarded his hand) he struck on the keys\r\nand played to admiration. All this while, through the clattering of the\r\nwires, din of the too nearly sounding bells, and noise that his wooden\r\ngloves made, the confusion was so great, that it was impossible for the\r\nmusician, or any that stood near him, to hear anything at all; yet, to\r\nthose at a distance, and especially in the streets, the harmony and the\r\ntime were the most exact and agreeable.\r\n\r\nThe south church is richly paved with black and white marble,--the west\r\nis a new fabric; and generally all the churches in Holland are furnished\r\nwith organs, lamps, and monuments, carefully preserved from the fury and\r\nimpiety of popular reformers, whose zeal has foolishly transported them\r\nin other places rather to act like madmen than religious.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HAERLEM]\r\n\r\nUpon St. Bartholomew's day, I went among the booksellers, and visited the\r\nfamous Hondius and Bleaw's shop, to buy some maps, atlases, and other\r\nworks of that kind. At another shop, I furnished myself with some shells\r\nand Indian curiosities; and so, toward the end of August, I returned\r\nagain to Haerlem by the river, ten miles in length, straight as a line,\r\nand of competent breadth for ships to sail by one another. They showed us\r\na cottage where, they told us, dwelt a woman who had been married to her\r\ntwenty-fifth husband, and being now a widow, was prohibited to marry in\r\nfuture; yet it could not be proved that she had ever made away with any\r\nof her husbands, though the suspicion had brought her divers times to\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nHaerlem is a very delicate town and hath one of the fairest churches of\r\nthe Gothic design I had ever seen. There hang in the steeple, which is\r\nvery high, two silver bells, said to have been brought from Damietta, in\r\nEgypt, by an earl of Holland, in memory of whose success they are rung\r\nout every evening. In the nave hang the goodliest branches of brass for\r\ntapers that I have seen, esteemed of great value for the curiosity of the\r\nworkmanship; also a fair pair of organs, which I could not find they made\r\nuse of in divine service, or so much as to assist them in singing psalms,\r\nbut only for show, and to recreate the people before and after their\r\ndevotions, while the burgomasters were walking and conferring about their\r\naffairs. Near the west window hang two models of ships, completely\r\nequipped, in memory of that invention of saws under their keels, with\r\nwhich they cut through the chain of booms, which barred the port of\r\nDamietta. Having visited this church, the fish-market, and made some\r\ninquiry about the printing-house, the invention whereof is said to have\r\nbeen in this town, I returned to Leyden.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LEYDEN]\r\n\r\nAt Leyden, I was carried up to the castle, or Pyrgus, built on a very\r\nsteep artificial mount, cast up (as reported) by Hengist the Saxon, on\r\nhis return out of England, as a place to retire to, in case of any sudden\r\ninundations.\r\n\r\nThe churches are many and fair; in one of them lies buried the learned\r\nand illustrious Joseph Scaliger, without any extraordinary inscription,\r\nwho, having left the world a monument of his worth more lasting than\r\nmarble, needed nothing more than his own name; which I think is all\r\nengraven on his sepulcher. He left his library to this University.\r\n\r\n28th August, 1641. I went to see the college and schools, which are\r\nnothing extraordinary, and was complimented with a _matricula_ by the\r\n_magnificus_ Professor, who first in Latin demanded of me where my\r\nlodging in the town was, my name, age, birth, and to what Faculty I\r\naddicted myself; then, recording my answers in a book, he administered an\r\noath to me that I should observe the statutes and orders of the\r\nUniversity while I stayed, and then delivered me a ticket, by virtue\r\nwhereof I was made excise-free; for all which worthy privileges, and the\r\npains of writing, he accepted of a rix-dollar.\r\n\r\nHere was now the famous Dan. Heinsius, whom I so longed to see, as well\r\nas the no less famous printer, Elzevir's printing-house and shop,\r\nrenowned for the politeness of the character and editions of what he has\r\npublished through Europe. Hence to the physic-garden, well stored with\r\nexotic plants, if the catalogue presented to me by the gardener be a\r\nfaithful register.\r\n\r\nBut, among all the rarities of this place, I was much pleased with a\r\nsight of their anatomy-school, theater, and repository adjoining, which\r\nis well furnished with natural curiosities; skeletons, from the whale and\r\nelephant to the fly and spider; which last is a very delicate piece of\r\nart, to see how the bones (if I may so call them of so tender an insect)\r\ncould be separated from the mucilaginous parts of that minute animal.\r\nAmong a great variety of other things, I was shown the knife newly taken\r\nout of a drunken Dutchman's guts, by an incision in his side, after it\r\nhad slipped from his fingers into his stomach. The pictures of the\r\nchirurgeon and his patient, both living, were there.\r\n\r\nThere is without the town a fair Mall, curiously planted.\r\n\r\nReturning to my lodging, I was showed the statue, cut in stone, of the\r\nhappy monk, whom they report to have been the first inventor of\r\ntypography, set over the door; but this is much controverted by others,\r\nwho strive for the glory of it, besides John Gutenberg.\r\n\r\nI was brought acquainted with a Burgundian Jew, who had married an\r\napostate Kentish woman. I asked him divers questions: he told me, among\r\nother things, that the World should never end; that our souls\r\ntransmigrated, and that even those of the most holy persons did penance\r\nin the bodies of brutes after death,--and so he interpreted the\r\nbanishment and savage life of Nebuchadnezzar: that all the Jews should\r\nrise again, and be led to Jerusalem; that the Romans only were the\r\noccasion of our Savior's death, whom he affirmed (as the Turks do) to be\r\na great prophet, but not the Messiah. He showed me several books of their\r\ndevotion, which he had translated into English, for the instruction of\r\nhis wife; he told me that when the Messiah came, all the ships, barks,\r\nand vessels of Holland should, by the power of certain strange\r\nwhirlwinds, be loosed from their anchors, and transported in a moment to\r\nall the desolate ports and havens throughout the world, wherever the\r\ndispersion was, to convey their brethren and tribes to the Holy City;\r\nwith other such like stuff. He was a merry drunken fellow, but would by\r\nno means handle any money (for something I purchased of him), it being\r\nSaturday; but desired me to leave it in the window, meaning to receive it\r\non Sunday morning.\r\n\r\n1st September, 1641. I went to Delft and Rotterdam, and two days after\r\nback to the Hague, to bespeak a suit of horseman's armor, which I caused\r\nto be made to fit me. I now rode out of town to see the monument of the\r\nwoman, pretended to have been a countess of Holland, reported to have had\r\nas many children at one birth, as there are days in the year. The basins\r\nwere hung up in which they were baptized, together with a large\r\ndescription of the matter-of-fact in a frame of carved work, in the\r\nchurch of Lysdun, a desolate place. As I returned, I diverted to see one\r\nof the Prince's Palaces, called the Hoff Van Hounsler's Dyck, a very fair\r\ncloistered and quadrangular building. The gallery is prettily painted\r\nwith several huntings, and at one end a gordian knot, with rustical\r\ninstruments so artificially represented, as to deceive an accurate eye to\r\ndistinguish it from actual relievo. The ceiling of the staircase is\r\npainted with the \"Rape of Ganymede,\" and other pendant figures, the work\r\nof F. Covenberg, of whose hand I bought an excellent drollery, which I\r\nafterward parted with to my brother George of Wotton, where it now hangs.\r\nTo this palace join a fair garden and park, curiously planted with limes.\r\n\r\n8th September, 1641. Returned to Rotterdam, through Delftshaven and\r\nSedan, where were at that time Colonel Goring's winter quarters. This\r\ntown has heretofore been very much talked of for witches.\r\n\r\n10th September, 1641. I took a wagon for Dort, to be present at the\r\nreception of the Queen-mother, Marie de Medicis, Dowager of France, widow\r\nof Henry the Great, and mother to the French King, Louis XIII., and the\r\nQueen of England, whence she newly arrived, tossed to and fro by the\r\nvarious fortune of her life. From this city, she designed for Cologne,\r\nconducted by the Earl of Arundel and the Herr Van Bredrod. At this\r\ninterview, I saw the Princess of Orange, and the lady her daughter,\r\nafterward married to the House of Brandenburgh. There was little\r\nremarkable in this reception befitting the greatness of her person; but\r\nan universal discontent, which accompanied that unlucky woman wherever\r\nshe went.\r\n\r\n12th September, 1641. I went toward Bois-le-Duc, where we arrived on the\r\n16th, at the time when the new citadel was advancing, with innumerable\r\nhands, and incomparable inventions for draining off the waters out of the\r\nfens and morasses about it, being by buckets, mills, cochleas, pumps, and\r\nthe like; in which the Hollanders are the most expert in Europe. Here\r\nwere now sixteen companies and nine troops of horse. They were also\r\ncutting a new river, to pass from the town to a castle not far from it.\r\nHere we split our skiff, falling foul upon another through negligence of\r\nthe master, who was fain to run aground, to our no little hazard. At our\r\narrival, a soldier conveyed us to the Governor, where our names were\r\ntaken, and our persons examined very strictly.\r\n\r\n17th September, 1641. I was permitted to walk the round and view the\r\nworks, and to visit a convent of religious women of the order of St.\r\nClara (who by the capitulation were allowed to enjoy their monastery and\r\nmaintenance undisturbed, at the surrender of the town twelve years\r\nsince), where we had a collation and very civil entertainment. They had a\r\nneat chapel, in which the heart of the Duke of Cleves, their founder,\r\nlies inhumed under a plate of brass. Within the cloister is a garden, and\r\nin the middle of it an overgrown lime tree, out of whose stem, near the\r\nroot, issue five upright and exceeding tall suckers, or bolls, the like\r\nwhereof for evenness and height I had not observed.\r\n\r\nThe chief church of this city is curiously carved within and without,\r\nfurnished with a pair of organs, and a most magnificent font of copper.\r\n\r\n18th September, 1641. I went to see that most impregnable town and fort\r\nof Hysdune, where I was exceedingly obliged to one Colonel Crombe, the\r\nlieutenant-governor, who would needs make me accept the honor of being\r\ncaptain of the watch, and to give the word this night. The fortification\r\nis very irregular, but esteemed one of the most considerable for strength\r\nand situation in the Netherlands. We departed toward Gorcum. Here Sir\r\nKenelm Digby, traveling toward Cologne, met us.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, the 19th, we arrived at Dort, passing by the Decoys,\r\nwhere they catch innumerable quantities of fowl.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROTTERDAM]\r\n\r\n22d September, 1641. I went again to Rotterdam to receive a pass which I\r\nexpected from Brussels, securing me through Brabant and Flanders,\r\ndesigning to go into England through those countries. The Cardinal\r\nInfante, brother to the King of Spain, was then governor. By this pass,\r\nhaving obtained another from the Prince of Orange, upon the 24th of\r\nSeptember I departed through Dort; but met with very bad tempestuous\r\nweather, being several times driven back, and obliged to lie at anchor\r\noff Keele, other vessels lying there waiting better weather. The 25th and\r\n26th we made other essays; but were again repulsed to the harbor, where\r\nlay sixty vessels waiting to sail. But, on the 27th, we, impatient of the\r\ntime and inhospitableness of the place, sailed again with a contrary and\r\nimpetuous wind and a terrible sea, in great jeopardy; for we had much\r\nado to keep ourselves above water, the billows breaking desperately on\r\nour vessel: we were driven into Williamstadt, a place garrisoned by the\r\nEnglish, where the governor had a fair house. The works, and especially\r\nthe counterscarp, are curiously hedged with quick, and planted with a\r\nstately row of limes on the rampart. The church is of a round structure,\r\nwith a cupola, and the town belongs entirely to the Prince of Orange, as\r\ndoes that of Breda, and some other places.\r\n\r\n28th September, 1641. Failing of an appointment, I was constrained to\r\nreturn to Dort for a bill of exchange; but it was the 1st of October ere\r\nI could get back. At Keele, I numbered 141 vessels, who durst not yet\r\nventure out; but, animated by the master of a stout bark, after a small\r\nencounter of weather, we arrived by four that evening at Steenbergen. In\r\nthe passage we sailed over a sea called the Plaats, an exceeding\r\ndangerous water, by reason of two contrary tides which meet there very\r\nimpetuously. Here, because of the many shelves, we were forced to tide it\r\nalong the Channel; but, ere we could gain the place, the ebb was so far\r\nspent, that we were compelled to foot it at least two long miles, through\r\na most pelting shower of rain.\r\n\r\n2d October, 1641. With a gentleman of the Rhyngraves, I went in a cart,\r\nor tumbrel (for it was no better; no other accommodation could be\r\nprocured), of two wheels and one horse, to Bergen-op-Zoom, meeting by the\r\nway divers parties of his Highness's army now retiring toward their\r\nwinter quarters; the convoy skiffs riding by thousands along the harbor.\r\nThe fort was heretofore built by the English.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I embarked for Lillo, having refused a convoy of horse\r\nwhich was offered me. The tide being against us, we landed short of the\r\nfort on the beach, where we marched half leg deep in mud, ere we could\r\ngain the dyke, which, being five or six miles from Lillo, we were forced\r\nto walk on foot very wet and discomposed; and then entering a boat we\r\npassed the ferry, and came to the castle. Being taken before the\r\nGovernor, he demanded my pass, to which he set his hand, and asked two\r\nrix-dollars for a fee, which methought appeared very exorbitant in a\r\nsoldier of his quality. I told him that I had already purchased my pass\r\nof the commissaries at Rotterdam; at which, in a great fury, snatching\r\nthe paper out of my hand, he flung it scornfully under the table, and\r\nbade me try whether I could get to Antwerp without his permission: but I\r\nhad no sooner given him the dollars, then he returned the passport\r\nsurlily enough, and made me pay fourteen Dutch shillings to the cantone,\r\nor searcher, for my contempt, which I was glad to do for fear of further\r\ntrouble, should he have discovered my Spanish pass, in which the States\r\nwere therein treated by the name of rebels. Besides all these exactions,\r\nI gave the commissary six shillings, to the soldiers something, and, ere\r\nperfectly clear of this frontier, thirty-one stivers to the man-of-war,\r\nwho lay blocking up the river between Lillo and the opposite sconce\r\ncalled Lifkinshoeck.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANTWERP]\r\n\r\n4th October, 1641. We sailed by several Spanish forts, out of one of\r\nwhich, St. Mary's port, came a Don on board us, to whom I showed my\r\nSpanish pass, which he signed, and civilly dismissed us. Hence, sailing\r\nby another man-of-war, to which we lowered our topsails, we at length\r\narrived at Antwerp.\r\n\r\nThe lodgings here are very handsome and convenient. I lost little time;\r\nbut, with the aid of one Mr. Lewkner, our conductor, we visited divers\r\nchurches, colleges, and monasteries. The Church of the Jesuits is most\r\nsumptuous and magnificent; a glorious fabric without and within, wholly\r\nincrusted with marble, inlaid and polished into divers representations of\r\nhistories, landscapes, and flowers. On the high altar is placed the\r\nstatue of the Blessed Virgin and our Savior in white marble, with a boss\r\nin the girdle set with very fair and rich sapphires, and divers other\r\nstones of price. The choir is a glorious piece of architecture: the\r\npulpit supported by four angels, and adorned with other carvings, and\r\nrare pictures by Rubens, now lately dead, and divers votive tables and\r\nrelics. Hence, to the Vroù Kirk, or Nôtre Dame of Antwerp: it is a very\r\nvenerable fabric, built after the Gothic manner, especially the tower,\r\nwhich I ascended, the better to take a view of the country adjacent;\r\nwhich, happening on a day when the sun shone exceedingly bright, and\r\ndarted his rays without any interruption, afforded so bright a reflection\r\nto us who were above, and had a full prospect of both land and water\r\nabout it, that I was much confirmed in my opinion of the moon's being of\r\nsome such substance as this earthly globe: perceiving all the subjacent\r\ncountry, at so small an horizontal distance, to repercuss such a light as\r\nI could hardly look against, save where the river, and other large water\r\nwithin our view, appeared of a more dark and uniform color; resembling\r\nthose spots in the moon supposed to be seas there, according to Hevelius,\r\nand as they appear in our late telescopes. I numbered in this church\r\nthirty privileged altars, that of St. Sebastian adorned with a painting\r\nof his martyrdom.\r\n\r\nWe went to see the Jerusalem Church, affirmed to have been founded by one\r\nwho, upon divers great wagers, passed to and fro between that city and\r\nAntwerp, on foot, by which he procured large sums of money, which he\r\nbestowed on this pious structure.[13] Hence, to St. Mary's Chapel, where\r\nI had some conference with two English Jesuits, confessors to Colonel\r\nJaye's regiment. These fathers conducted us to the Cloister of Nuns,\r\nwhere we heard a Dutch sermon upon the exposure of the Host. The\r\nSenate-house of this city is a very spacious and magnificent building.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: This notice, slipped by accident into the entries\r\n    which refer to Antwerp, belongs to those of Bruges.]\r\n\r\n5th October, 1641. I visited the Jesuits' School, which, for the fame of\r\ntheir method, I greatly desired to see. They were divided into four\r\nclasses, with several inscriptions over each: as, first, _Ad majorem Dei\r\ngloriam_; over the second, _Princeps diligentiæ_; the third, _Imperator\r\nByzantiorum_; over the fourth and uppermost, _Imperator Romanorum_. Under\r\nthese, the scholars and pupils and their places, or forms with titles and\r\npriority according to their proficiency. Their dormitory and lodgings\r\nabove were exceedingly neat. They have a prison for the offenders and\r\nless diligent; and, in an ample court, to recreate themselves in, is an\r\naviary, and a yard, where eagles, vultures, foxes, monkeys, and other\r\nanimals are kept, to divert the boys withal at their hours of remission.\r\nTo this school join the music and mathematical schools, and lastly a\r\npretty, neat chapel. The great street is built after the Italian mode, in\r\nthe middle whereof is erected a glorious crucifix of white and black\r\nmarble, greater than the life. This is a very fair and noble street,\r\nclean, well paved, and sweet to admiration.\r\n\r\nThe Oesters house, belonging to the East India Company, is a stately\r\npalace, adorned with more than 300 windows. From hence, walking into the\r\nGun-garden, I was allowed to see as much of the citadel as is permitted\r\nto strangers. It is a matchless piece of modern fortification,\r\naccommodated with lodgments for the soldiers and magazines. The graffs,\r\nramparts, and platforms are stupendous. Returning by the shop of\r\nPlantine, I bought some books, for the namesake only of that famous\r\nprinter.\r\n\r\nBut there was nothing about this city which more ravished me than those\r\ndelicious shades and walks of stately trees, which render the fortified\r\nworks of the town one of the sweetest places in Europe; nor did I ever\r\nobserve a more quiet, clean, elegantly built and civil place, than this\r\nmagnificent and famous city of Antwerp. In the evening, I was invited to\r\nSignor Duerte's, a Portuguese by nation, an exceeding rich merchant,\r\nwhose palace I found to be furnished like a prince's. His three daughters\r\nentertained us with rare music, vocal and instrumental, which was\r\nfinished with a handsome collation. I took leave of the ladies and of\r\nsweet Antwerp, as late as it was, embarking for Brussels on the Scheldt\r\nin a vessel, which delivered us to a second boat (in another river) drawn\r\nor towed by horses. In this passage, we frequently changed our barge, by\r\nreason of the bridges thwarting our course. Here I observed numerous\r\nfamilies inhabiting their vessels and floating dwellings, so built and\r\ndivided by cabins, as few houses on land enjoyed better accommodation;\r\nstored with all sorts of utensils, neat chambers, a pretty parlor, and\r\nkept so sweet, that nothing could be more refreshing. The rivers on which\r\nthey are drawn are very clear and still waters, and pass through a most\r\npleasant country on both the banks. We had in our boat a very good\r\nordinary, and excellent company. The cut is straight as a line for twenty\r\nEnglish miles. What I much admired was, near the midway, another\r\nartificial river, which intersects this at right angles, but on an\r\neminence of ground, and is carried in an aqueduct of stone so far above\r\nthe other as that the waters neither mingle, nor hinder one another's\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nWe came to a town called Villefrow, where all the passengers went on\r\nshore to wash at a fountain issuing out of a pillar, and then came\r\naboard again. On the margin of this long tract are abundance of shrines\r\nand images, defended from the injuries of the weather by niches of stone\r\nwherein they are placed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BRUSSELS]\r\n\r\n7th October, 1641. We arrived at Brussels at nine in the morning. The\r\nStadt-house, near the market place, is, for the carving in freestone, a\r\nmost laborious and finished piece, well worthy observation. The\r\nflesh-shambles are also built of stone. I was pleased with certain small\r\nengines, by which a girl, or boy, was able to draw up, or let down, great\r\nbridges, which in divers parts of this city crossed the channel for the\r\nbenefit of passengers. The walls of this town are very entire, and full\r\nof towers at competent distances. The cathedral is built upon a very high\r\nand exceeding steep ascent, to which we mounted by fair steps of stone.\r\nHence I walked to a convent of English Nuns, with whom I sat discoursing\r\nmost part of the afternoon.\r\n\r\n8th October, 1641. Being the morning I came away, I went to see the\r\nPrince's Court, an ancient, confused building, not much unlike the Hofft,\r\nat the Hague: there is here likewise a very large hall, where they vend\r\nall sorts of wares. Through this we passed by the chapel, which is indeed\r\nrarely arched, and in the middle of it was the hearse, or catafalque, of\r\nthe late Archduchess, the wise and pious Clara Eugenia. Out of this we\r\nwere conducted to the lodgings, tapestried with incomparable arras, and\r\nadorned with many excellent pieces of Rubens, old and young Breugel,\r\nTitian, and Stenwick, with stories of most of the late actions in the\r\nNetherlands.\r\n\r\nBy an accident we could not see the library. There is a fair terrace\r\nwhich looks to the vineyard, in which, on pedestals, are fixed the\r\nstatues of all the Spanish kings of the house of Austria. The opposite\r\nwalls are painted by Rubens, being an history of the late tumults in\r\nBelgia: in the last piece, the Archduchess shuts a great pair of gates\r\nupon Mars, who is coming out of hell, armed, and in a menacing posture;\r\nwhich, with that other of the Infanta taking leave of Don Philip IV., is\r\na most incomparable table.\r\n\r\nFrom hence, we walked into the park, which for being entirely within the\r\nwalls of the city is particularly remarkable: nor is it less pleasant\r\nthan if in the most solitary recesses; so naturally is it furnished with\r\nwhatever may render it agreeable, melancholy, and country-like. Here is a\r\nstately heronry, divers springs of water, artificial cascades, rocks,\r\ngrots; one whereof is composed of the extravagant roots of trees,\r\ncunningly built and hung together with wires. In this park are both\r\nfallow and red deer.\r\n\r\nFrom hence, we were led into the Menage, and out of that into a most\r\nsweet and delicious garden, where was another grot of more neat and\r\ncostly materials, full of noble statues, and entertaining us with\r\nartificial music; but the hedge of water, in form of lattice-work, which\r\nthe fountaineer caused to ascend out of the earth by degrees, exceedingly\r\npleased and surprised me; for thus, with a pervious wall, or rather a\r\npalisade hedge of water, was the whole parterre environed.\r\n\r\nThere is likewise a fair aviary; and in the court next it are kept divers\r\nsorts of animals, rare and exotic fowl, as eagles, cranes, storks,\r\nbustards, pheasants of several kinds, and a duck having four wings. In\r\nanother division of the same close are rabbits of an almost perfect\r\nyellow color.\r\n\r\nThere was no Court now in the palace; the Infante Cardinal, who was the\r\nGovernor of Flanders, being dead but newly, and every one in deep\r\nmourning.\r\n\r\nAt near eleven o'clock, I repaired to his Majesty's agent, Sir Henry de\r\nVic, who very courteously received me, and accommodated me with a coach\r\nand six horses, which carried me from Brussels to Ghent, where it was to\r\nmeet my Lord of Arundel, Earl Marshal of England, who had requested me\r\nwhen I was at Antwerp to send it for him, if I went not thither myself.\r\n\r\nThus taking leave of Brussels and a sad Court, yet full of gallant\r\npersons (for in this small city, the acquaintance being universal, ladies\r\nand gentlemen, I perceived had great diversions, and frequent meetings),\r\nI hastened toward Ghent. On the way, I met with divers little wagons,\r\nprettily contrived, and full of peddling merchandise, drawn by mastiff\r\ndogs, harnessed completely like so many coach horses; in some four, in\r\nothers six, as in Brussels itself I had observed. In Antwerp I saw, as I\r\nremember, four dogs draw five lusty children in a chariot: the master\r\ncommands them whither he pleases, crying his wares about the streets.\r\nAfter passing through Ouse, by six in the evening, I arrived at Ghent.\r\nThis is a city of so great a circumference, that it is reported to be\r\nseven leagues round; but there is not half of it now built, much of it\r\nremaining in fields and desolate pastures even within the walls, which\r\nhave strong gates toward the west, and two fair churches.\r\n\r\nHere I beheld the palace wherein John of Gaunt and Charles V. were born;\r\nwhose statue[14] stands in the market-place, upon a high pillar, with his\r\nsword drawn, to which (as I was told) the magistrates and burghers were\r\nwont to repair upon a certain day every year with ropes about their\r\nnecks, in token of submission and penance for an old rebellion of theirs;\r\nbut now the hemp is changed into a blue ribbon. Here is planted the\r\nbasilisco, or great gun, so much talked of. The Lys and the Scheldt\r\nmeeting in this vast city, divide it into twenty-six islands, which are\r\nunited by many bridges, somewhat resembling Venice. This night I supped\r\nwith the Abbot of Andoyne, a pleasant and courteous priest.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: That of Charles V.]\r\n\r\n8th October, 1641. I passed by a boat to Bruges, taking in at a redoubt a\r\nconvoy of fourteen musketeers, because the other side of the river, being\r\nContribution-land, was subject to the inroads and depredations of the\r\nbordering States. This river was cut by the famous Marquis Spinola, and\r\nis in my judgment a wonderful piece of labor, and a worthy public work,\r\nbeing in some places forced through the main rock, to an incredible\r\ndepth, for thirty miles. At the end of each mile is built a small\r\nredoubt, which communicates a line to the next, and so the whole way,\r\nfrom whence we received many volleys of shot, in compliment to my Lord\r\nMarshal, who was in our vessel, a passenger with us. At five that\r\nevening, we were met by the magistrates of Bruges, who came out to convey\r\nmy Lord to his lodgings, at whose cost he was entertained that night.\r\n\r\nThe morning after we went to see the Stadt-house and adjoining aqueduct,\r\nthe church, and market-place, where we saw cheeses and butter piled up in\r\nheaps; also the fortifications and graffs, which are extremely large.\r\n\r\nThe 9th, we arrived at Ostend by a straight and artificial river. Here,\r\nwith leave of the captain of the watch, I was carried to survey the\r\nriver and harbor, with fortifications on one side thereof: the east and\r\nsouth are mud and earth walls. It is a very strong place, and lately\r\nstood a memorable siege three years, three months, three weeks, and three\r\ndays. I went to see the church of St. Peter, and the cloisters of the\r\nFranciscans.\r\n\r\n10th October, 1641. I went by wagon, accompanied with a jovial\r\ncommissary, to Dunkirk, the journey being made all on the sea sands. On\r\nour arrival, we first viewed the court of guards, the works, the\r\ntownhouse, and the new church; the latter is very beautiful within; and\r\nanother, wherein they showed us an excellent piece of \"Our Savior's\r\nBearing the Cross.\" The harbor, in two channels, coming up to the town,\r\nwas choked with a multitude of prizes.\r\n\r\nFrom hence, the next day, I marched three English miles toward the packet\r\nboat, being a pretty frigate of six guns, which embarked us for England\r\nabout three in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DOVER]\r\n\r\nAt our going off, the fort, against which our pinnace anchored saluted my\r\nLord Marshal with twelve great guns, which we answered with three. Not\r\nhaving the wind favorable, we anchored that night before Calais. About\r\nmidnight, we weighed; and, at four in the morning, though not far from\r\nDover, we could not make the pier till four that afternoon, the wind\r\nproving contrary and driving us westward: but at last we got on shore,\r\nOctober the 12th.\r\n\r\nFrom Dover, I that night rode post to Canterbury. Here I visited the\r\ncathedral, then in great splendor; those famous windows being entire,\r\nsince demolished by the fanatics. The next morning by Sittingbourne, I\r\ncame to Rochester, and thence to Gravesend, where a light-horseman (as\r\nthey call it) taking us in, we spent our tide as far as Greenwich. From\r\nhence, after we had a little refreshed ourselves at the College (for by\r\nreason of contagion then in London we balked the inns), we came to\r\nLondon, landing at Arundel stairs. Here I took leave of his Lordship, and\r\nretired to my lodgings in the Middle Temple, being about two in the\r\nmorning, the 14th of October.\r\n\r\n16th October, 1641. I went to see my brother at Wotton. On the 31st of\r\nthat month (unfortunate for the Irish Rebellion, which broke out on the\r\n23d), I was one and twenty years of age.\r\n\r\n7th November, 1641. After receiving the Sacrament at Wotton church, I\r\nvisited my Lord Marshal at Albury.\r\n\r\n23d November, 1641. I returned to London; and, on the 25th, saw his\r\nMajesty ride through the City after his coming out of Scotland, and a\r\nPeace proclaimed, with great acclamations and joy of the giddy people.\r\n\r\n15th December, 1641. I was elected one of the Comptrollers of the Middle\r\nTemple revellers, as the fashion of the young students and gentlemen was,\r\nthe Christmas being kept this year with great solemnity; but, being\r\ndesirous to pass it in the country, I got leave to resign my staff of\r\noffice, and went with my brother Richard to Wotton.\r\n\r\n10th January, 1642. I gave a visit to my cousin Hatton, of Ditton.\r\n\r\n19th January, 1642. I went to London, where I stayed till 5th of March,\r\nstudying a little, but dancing and fooling more.\r\n\r\n3d October, 1642. To Chichester, and hence the next day to see the siege\r\nof Portsmouth; for now was that bloody difference between the King and\r\nParliament broken out, which ended in the fatal tragedy so many years\r\nafter. It was on the day of its being rendered to Sir William Waller;\r\nwhich gave me an opportunity of taking my leave of Colonel Goring, the\r\ngovernor, now embarking for France. This day was fought that signal\r\nbattle at Edgehill. Thence I went to Southampton and Winchester, where I\r\nvisited the castle, school, church, and King Arthur's Round Table; but\r\nespecially the church, and its Saxon kings' monuments, which I esteemed a\r\nworthy antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe 12th of November was the battle of Brentford, surprisingly fought;\r\nand to the great consternation of the City, had his Majesty (as it was\r\nbelieved he would) pursued his advantage. I came in with my horse and\r\narms just at the retreat; but was not permitted to stay longer than the\r\n15th, by reason of the army marching to Gloucester; which would have left\r\nboth me and my brothers exposed to ruin, without any advantage to his\r\nMajesty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n7th December, 1642. I went from Wotton to London, to see the so much\r\ncelebrated line of communication, and on the 10th returned to Wotton,\r\nnobody knowing of my having been in his Majesty's army.\r\n\r\n10th March, 1643. I went to Hartingford-berry to visit my cousin,\r\nKeightly.\r\n\r\n11th March, 1643. I went to see my Lord of Salisbury's Palace at\r\nHatfield, where the most considerable rarity, besides the house (inferior\r\nto few then in England for its architecture), were the garden and\r\nvineyard, rarely well watered and planted. They also showed us the\r\npicture of Secretary Cecil, in Mosaic work, very well done by some\r\nItalian hand.\r\n\r\nI must not forget what amazed us exceedingly in the night before, namely,\r\na shining cloud in the air, in shape resembling a sword, the point\r\nreaching to the north; it was as bright as the moon, the rest of the sky\r\nbeing very serene. It began about eleven at night, and vanished not till\r\nabove one, being seen by all the south of England. I made many journeys\r\nto and from London.\r\n\r\n15th April, 1643. To Hatfield, and near the town of Hertford I went to\r\nsee Sir J. Harrison's house new built. Returning to London, I called to\r\nsee his Majesty's house and gardens at Theobald's, since demolished by\r\nthe rebels.\r\n\r\n2d May, 1643. I went from Wotton to London, where I saw the furious and\r\nzealous people demolish that stately Cross in Cheapside.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th I returned, with no little regret, for the confusion that\r\nthreatened us. Resolving to possess myself in some quiet, if it might be,\r\nin a time of so great jealousy, I built by my brother's permission, a\r\nstudy, made a fish-pond, an island, and some other solitudes and\r\nretirements at Wotton; which gave the first occasion of improving them to\r\nthose waterworks and gardens which afterward succeeded them, and became\r\nat that time the most famous of England.\r\n\r\n12th July, 1643. I sent my black menage horse and furniture with a friend\r\nto his Majesty, then at Oxford.\r\n\r\n23d July, 1643. The Covenant being pressed, I absented myself; but,\r\nfinding it impossible to evade the doing very unhandsome things, and\r\nwhich had been a great cause of my perpetual motions hitherto between\r\nWotton and London, October the 2d, I obtained a license of his Majesty,\r\ndated at Oxford and signed by the King, to travel again.\r\n\r\n6th November, 1643. Lying by the way from Wotton at Sir Ralph\r\nWhitfield's, at Blechingley (whither both my brothers had conducted me),\r\nI arrived at London on the 7th, and two days after took boat at the\r\nTower-wharf, which carried me as far as Sittingbourne, though not without\r\ndanger, I being only in a pair of oars, exposed to a hideous storm: but\r\nit pleased God that we got in before the peril was considerable. From\r\nthence, I went by post to Dover, accompanied with one Mr. Thicknesse, a\r\nvery dear friend of mine.\r\n\r\n11th November, 1643. Having a reasonable good passage, though the weather\r\nwas snowy and untoward enough, we came before Calais, where, as we went\r\non shore, mistaking the tide, our shallop struck on the sands, with no\r\nlittle danger; but at length we got off.\r\n\r\nCalais is considered an extraordinary well-fortified place, in the old\r\ncastle and new citadel regarding the sea. The haven consists of a long\r\nbank of sand, lying opposite to it. The market place and the church are\r\nremarkable things, besides those relics of our former dominion there. I\r\nremember there were engraven in stone, upon the front of an ancient\r\ndwelling which was showed us, these words in English--\"God save the\r\nKing,\" together with the name of the architect and date. The walls of the\r\ntown are substantial; but the situation toward the land is not pleasant,\r\nby reason of the marshes and low grounds about it.\r\n\r\n12th November, 1643. After dinner we took horse with the Messagere,\r\nhoping to have arrived at Boulogne that night; but there fell so great a\r\nsnow, accompanied with hail, rain, and sudden darkness, that we had much\r\nado to gain the next village; and in this passage, being to cross a\r\nvalley by a causeway, and a bridge built over a small river, the rain\r\nthat had fallen making it an impetuous stream for near a quarter of a\r\nmile, my horse slipping had almost been the occasion of my perishing. We\r\nnone of us went to bed; for the soldiers in those parts leaving little in\r\nthe villages, we had enough to do to get ourselves dry, by morning,\r\nbetween the fire and the fresh straw. The next day early, we arrived at\r\nBoulogne.\r\n\r\nThis is a double town, one part of it situate on a high rock, or downs;\r\nthe other, called the lower town, is yet with a great declivity toward\r\nthe sea; both of them defended by a strong castle, which stands on a\r\nnotable eminence. Under the town runs the river, which is yet but an\r\ninconsiderable brook. Henry VIII., in the siege of this place is said to\r\nhave used those great leathern guns which I have since beheld in the\r\nTower of London, inscribed, \"_Non Marte opus est cui non deficit\r\nMercurius_\"; if at least the history be true, which my Lord Herbert\r\ndoubts.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, in some danger of parties [Spanish] surprising us, we\r\ncame to Montreuil, built on the summit of a most conspicuous hill,\r\nenvironed with fair and ample meadows; but all the suburbs had been from\r\ntime to time ruined, and were now lately burnt by the Spanish inroads.\r\nThis town is fortified with two very deep dry ditches; the walls about\r\nthe bastions and citadel are a noble piece of masonry. The church is more\r\nglorious without than within; the market place large; but the inhabitants\r\nare miserably poor. The next day, we came to Abbeville, having passed all\r\nthis way in continual expectation of the volunteers, as they call them.\r\nThis town affords a good aspect toward the hill from whence we descended:\r\nnor does it deceive us; for it is handsomely built, and has many pleasant\r\nand useful streams passing through it, the main river being the Somme,\r\nwhich discharges itself into the sea at St. Valery, almost in view of the\r\ntown. The principal church is a very handsome piece of Gothic\r\narchitecture, and the ports and ramparts sweetly planted for defense and\r\nornament. In the morning, they brought us choice of guns and pistols to\r\nsell at reasonable rates, and neatly made, being here a merchandise of\r\ngreat account, the town abounding in gunsmiths.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ST. DENIS]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PARIS]\r\n\r\nHence we advanced to Beauvais, another town of good note, and having the\r\nfirst vineyards we had seen. The next day to Beaumont, and the morrow to\r\nParis, having taken our repast at St. Denis, two leagues from that great\r\ncity. St. Denis is considerable only for its stately cathedral, and the\r\ndormitory of the French kings, there inhumed as ours at Westminster\r\nAbbey. The treasury is esteemed one of the richest in Europe. The church\r\nwas built by King Dagobert,[15] but since much enlarged, being now 390\r\nfeet long, 100 in breadth, and 80 in height, without comprehending the\r\ncover: it has also a very high shaft of stone, and the gates are of\r\nbrass. Here, while the monks conducted us, we were showed the ancient and\r\nmodern sepulchers of their kings, beginning with the founder to Louis his\r\nson, with Charles Martel and Pepin, son and father of Charlemagne. These\r\nlie in the choir, and without it are many more: among the rest that of\r\nBertrand du Guesclin, Constable of France; in the chapel of Charles V.,\r\nall his posterity; and near him the magnificent sepulcher of Francis I.,\r\nwith his children, wars, victories, and triumphs engraven in marble. In\r\nthe nave of the church lies the catafalque, or hearse, of Louis XIII.,\r\nHenry II., a noble tomb of Francis II., and Charles IX. Above are bodies\r\nof several Saints; below, under a state of black velvet, the late Louis\r\nXIII., father of this present monarch. Every one of the ten chapels, or\r\noratories, had some Saints in them; among the rest, one of the Holy\r\nInnocents. The treasury is kept in the sacristy above, in which are\r\ncrosses of massy gold and silver, studded with precious stones, one of\r\ngold three feet high, set with sapphires, rubies, and great oriental\r\npearls. Another given by Charles the Great, having a noble amethyst in\r\nthe middle of it, stones and pearls of inestimable value. Among the still\r\nmore valuable relics are, a nail from our Savior's Cross, in a box of\r\ngold full of precious stones; a crucifix of the true wood of the Cross,\r\ncarved by Pope Clement III., enchased in a crystal covered with gold; a\r\nbox in which is some of the Virgin's hair; some of the linen in which our\r\nblessed Savior was wrapped at his nativity; in a huge reliquary, modeled\r\nlike a church, some of our Savior's blood, hair, clothes, linen with\r\nwhich he wiped the Apostles' feet; with many other equally authentic\r\ntoys, which the friar who conducted us would have us believe were\r\nauthentic relics. Among the treasures is the crown of Charlemagne, his\r\nseven-foot high scepter and hand of justice, the agraffe of his royal\r\nmantle, beset with diamonds and rubies, his sword, belt, and spurs of\r\ngold; the crown of St. Louis, covered with precious stones, among which\r\nis one vast ruby, uncut, of inestimable value, weighing 300 carats (under\r\nwhich is set one of the thorns of our blessed Savior's crown), his\r\nsword, seal, and hand of justice. The two crowns of Henry IV., his\r\nscepter, hand of justice, and spurs. The two crowns of his son Louis. In\r\nthe cloak-royal of Anne of Bretagne is a very great and rare ruby. Divers\r\nbooks covered with solid plates of gold, and studded with precious\r\nstones. Two vases of beryl, two of agate, whereof one is esteemed for its\r\nbigness, color, and embossed carving, the best now to be seen: by a\r\nspecial favor I was permitted to take the measure and dimensions of it;\r\nthe story is a Bacchanalia and sacrifice to Priapus; a very holy thing\r\ntruly, and fit for a cloister! It is really antique, and the noblest\r\njewel there. There is also a large gondola of chrysolite, a huge urn of\r\nporphyry, another of calcedon, a vase of onyx, the largest I had ever\r\nseen of that stone; two of crystal; a morsel of one of the waterpots in\r\nwhich our Savior did his first miracle; the effigies of the Queen of\r\nSaba, of Julius, Augustus, Mark Antony, Cleopatra, and others, upon\r\nsapphires, topazes, agates, and cornelians: that of the queen of Saba[16]\r\nhas a Moorish face; those of Julius and Nero on agates are rarely colored\r\nand cut. A cup in which Solomon was used to drink, and an Apollo on a\r\ngreat amethyst. There lay in a window a mirror of a kind of stone said to\r\nhave belonged to the poet Virgil. Charlemagne's chessmen, full of Arabic\r\ncharacters. In the press next the door, the brass lantern full of\r\ncrystals, said to have conducted Judas and his company to apprehend our\r\nblessed Savior. A fair unicorn's horn, sent by a king of Persia, about\r\nseven feet long. In another press (over which stands the picture in oil\r\nof their Orleans Amazon with her sword), the effigies of the late French\r\nkings in wax, like ours in Westminster, covered with their robes; with a\r\nworld of other rarities. Having rewarded our courteous friar, we took\r\nhorse for Paris, where we arrived about five in the afternoon. In the way\r\nwere fair crosses of stone carved with fleur-de-lis at every furlong's\r\nend, where they affirm St. Denis rested and laid down his head after\r\nmartyrdom, carrying it from the place where this monastery is builded. We\r\nlay at Paris at the Ville de Venice; where, after I had something\r\nrefreshed, I went to visit Sir Richard Browne, his Majesty's Resident\r\nwith the French king.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: A. D. 630.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: Or Sheba.]\r\n\r\n5th December, 1643. The Earl of Norwich came as Ambassador extraordinary:\r\nI went to meet him in a coach and six horses, at the palace of Monsieur\r\nde Bassompière, where I saw that gallant person, his gardens, terraces,\r\nand rare prospects. My lord was waited on by the master of the\r\nceremonies, and a very great cavalcade of men of quality, to the Palais\r\nCardinal, where on the 23d he had audience of the French king, and the\r\nqueen Regent his mother, in the golden chamber of presence. From thence,\r\nI conducted him to his lodgings in Rue St. Denis, and so took my leave.\r\n\r\n24th December, 1643. I went with some company to see some remarkable\r\nplaces without the city: as the Isle, and how it is encompassed by the\r\nRivers Seine and the Ouse. The city is divided into three parts, whereof\r\nthe town is greatest. The city lies between it and the University in form\r\nof an island. Over the Seine is a stately bridge called Pont Neuf, begun\r\nby Henry III. in 1578, finished by Henry IV. his successor. It is all of\r\nhewn freestone found under the streets, but more plentifully at\r\nMontmartre, and consists of twelve arches, in the midst of which ends the\r\npoint of an island, on which are built handsome artificers' houses. There\r\nis one large passage for coaches, and two for foot passengers three or\r\nfour feet higher, and of convenient breadth for eight or ten to go\r\nabreast. On the middle of this stately bridge, on one side, stands the\r\nfamous statue of Henry the Great on horseback, exceeding the natural\r\nproportion by much; and, on the four faces of a stately pedestal (which\r\nis composed of various sorts of polished marbles and rich moldings),\r\ninscriptions of his victories and most signal actions are engraven in\r\nbrass. The statue and horse are of copper, the work of the great John di\r\nBologna, and sent from Florence by Ferdinand the First, and Cosmo the\r\nSecond, uncle and cousin to Mary de Medicis, the wife of King Henry,\r\nwhose statue it represents. The place where it is erected is inclosed\r\nwith a strong and beautiful grate of iron, about which there are always\r\nmountebanks showing their feats to the idle passengers. From hence is a\r\nrare prospect toward the Louvre and suburbs of St. Germains, the Isle du\r\nPalais, and Nôtre Dame. At the foot of this bridge is a water-house, on\r\nthe front whereof, at a great height, is the story of Our Savior and the\r\nwoman of Samaria pouring water out of a bucket. Above, is a very rare\r\ndial of several motions, with a chime, etc. The water is conveyed by huge\r\nwheels, pumps, and other engines, from the river beneath. The confluence\r\nof the people and multitude of coaches passing every moment over the\r\nbridge, to a new spectator is an agreeable diversion. Other bridges there\r\nare, as that of Nôtre Dame and the Pont-au-Change, etc., fairly built,\r\nwith houses of stone, which are laid over this river; only the Pont St.\r\nAnne, landing the suburbs of St. Germains at the Tuileries, is built of\r\nwood, having likewise a water house in the midst of it, and a statue of\r\nNeptune casting water out of a whale's mouth, of lead, but much inferior\r\nto the Samaritan.\r\n\r\nThe University lies southwest on higher ground, contiguous to, but the\r\nlesser part of, Paris. They reckon no less than sixty-five colleges; but\r\nthey in nothing approach ours at Oxford for state and order. The\r\nbooksellers dwell within the University. The schools (of which more\r\nhereafter) are very regular.\r\n\r\nThe suburbs are those of St. Denis, Honoré, St. Marcel, St. Jaques, St.\r\nMichael, St. Victoire, and St. Germains, which last is the largest, and\r\nwhere the nobility and persons of best quality are seated: and truly\r\nParis, comprehending the suburbs, is, for the material the houses are\r\nbuilt with, and many noble and magnificent piles, one of the most gallant\r\ncities in the world; large in circuit, of a round form, very populous,\r\nbut situated in a bottom, environed with gentle declivities, rendering\r\nsome places very dirty, and making it smell as if sulphur were mingled\r\nwith the mud; yet it is paved with a kind of freestone, of near a foot\r\nsquare, which renders it more easy to walk on than our pebbles in London.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas eve, I went to see the Cathedral at Nôtre Dame, erected by\r\nPhilip Augustus, but begun by King Robert, son of Hugh Capet. It consists\r\nof a Gothic fabric, sustained with 120 pillars, which make two aisles in\r\nthe church round about the choir, without comprehending the chapels,\r\nbeing 174 paces long, 60 wide, and 100 high. The choir is inclosed with\r\nstonework graven with the sacred history, and contains forty-five chapels\r\nchancelled with iron. At the front of the chief entrance are statues in\r\nrelievo of the kings, twenty-eight in number, from Childebert to the\r\nfounder, Philip; and above them are two high square towers, and another\r\nof a smaller size, bearing a spire in the middle, where the body of the\r\nchurch forms a cross. The great tower is ascended by 389 steps, having\r\ntwelve galleries from one to the other. They greatly reverence the\r\ncrucifix over the screen of the choir, with an image of the Blessed\r\nVirgin. There are some good modern paintings hanging on the pillars. The\r\nmost conspicuous statute is the huge colossal one of St. Christopher;\r\nwith divers other figures of men, houses, prospects and rocks, about this\r\ngigantic piece; being of one stone, and more remarkable for its bulk than\r\nany other perfection. This is the prime church of France for dignity,\r\nhaving archdeacons, vicars, canons, priests, and chaplains in good store,\r\nto the number of 127. It is also the palace of the archbishop. The young\r\nking was there with a great and martial guard, who entered the nave of\r\nthe church with drums and fifes, at the ceasing of which I was\r\nentertained with the church music; and so I left him.\r\n\r\n4th January, 1644. I passed this day with one Mr. J. Wall, an Irish\r\ngentleman, who had been a friar in Spain, and afterward a reader in St.\r\nIsodore's chair, at Rome; but was, I know not how, getting away, and\r\npretending to be a soldier of fortune, an absolute cavalier, having, as\r\nhe told us, been a captain of horse in Germany. It is certain he was an\r\nexcellent disputant, and so strangely given to it that nothing could pass\r\nhim. He would needs persuade me to go with him this morning to the\r\nJesuits' College, to witness his polemical talent. We found the Fathers\r\nin their Church at the Rue St. Antoine, where one of them showed us that\r\nnoble fabric, which for its cupola, pavings, incrustations of marble, the\r\npulpit, altars (especially the high altar), organ, lavatorium, etc., but\r\nabove all, for the richly carved and incomparable front I esteem to be\r\none of the most perfect pieces of architecture in Europe, emulating even\r\nsome of the greatest now at Rome itself. But this not being what our\r\nfriar sought, he led us into the adjoining convent, where, having shown\r\nus the library, they began a very hot dispute on some points of divinity,\r\nwhich our cavalier contested only to show his pride, and to that\r\nindiscreet height, that the Jesuits would hardly bring us to our coach,\r\nthey being put beside all patience. The next day, we went into the\r\nUniversity, and into the College of Navarre, which is a spacious,\r\nwell-built quadrangle, having a very noble library.\r\n\r\nThence to the Sorbonne, an ancient fabric built by one Robert de\r\nSorbonne, whose name it retains, but the restoration which the late\r\nCardinal de Richelieu has made to it renders it one of the most excellent\r\nmodern buildings; the sumptuous church, of admirable architecture, is far\r\nsuperior to the rest. The cupola, portico, and whole design of the\r\nchurch, are very magnificent.\r\n\r\nWe entered into some of the schools, and in that of divinity we found a\r\ngrave Doctor in his chair, with a multitude of auditors, who all write as\r\nhe dictates; and this they call a Course. After we had sat a little, our\r\ncavalier started up, and rudely enough began to dispute with the doctor;\r\nat which, and especially as he was clad in the Spanish habit, which in\r\nParis is the greatest bugbear imaginable, the scholars and doctor fell\r\ninto such a fit of laughter, that nobody could be heard speak for a\r\nwhile: but silence being obtained, he began to speak Latin, and made his\r\napology in so good a style, that their derision was turned to admiration;\r\nand beginning to argue, he so baffled the Professor, that with universal\r\napplause they all rose up, and did him great honors, waiting on us to the\r\nvery street and our coach, and testifying great satisfaction.\r\n\r\n2d February, 1644. I heard the news of my nephew George's birth, which\r\nwas on January 15th, English style, 1644.\r\n\r\n3d February, 1644. I went to the Exchange. The late addition to the\r\nbuildings is very noble; but the galleries where they sell their petty\r\nmerchandise nothing so stately as ours at London, no more than the place\r\nwhere they walk below, being only a low vault.\r\n\r\nThe Palaise, as they call the upper part, was built in the time of Philip\r\nthe Fair, noble and spacious. The great Hall annexed to it, is arched\r\nwith stone, having a range of pillars in the middle, round which, and at\r\nthe sides, are shops of all kinds, especially booksellers'. One side is\r\nfull of pews for the clerks of the advocates, who swarm here (as ours at\r\nWestminster). At one of the ends stands an altar, at which mass is said\r\ndaily. Within are several chambers, courts, treasuries, etc. Above that\r\nis the most rich and glorious Salle d'Audience, the chamber of St.\r\nLouis, and other superior Courts where the Parliament sits, richly gilt\r\non embossed carvings and frets, and exceedingly beautified.\r\n\r\nWithin the place where they sell their wares, is another narrower\r\ngallery, full of shops and toys, etc., which looks down into the\r\nprison-yard. Descending by a large pair of stairs, we passed by Sainte\r\nChapelle, which is a church built by St. Louis, 1242, after the Gothic\r\nmanner: it stands on another church, which is under it, sustained by\r\npillars at the sides, which seem so weak as to appear extraordinary in\r\nthe artist. This chapel is most famous for its relics, having as they\r\npretend, almost the entire crown of thorns: the agate patine, rarely\r\nsculptured, judged one of the largest and best in Europe. There was now a\r\nvery beautiful spire erecting. The court below is very spacious, capable\r\nof holding many coaches, and surrounded with shops, especially\r\nengravers', goldsmiths', and watchmakers'. In it are a fair fountain and\r\nportico. The Isle du Palais consists of a triangular brick building,\r\nwhereof one side, looking to the river, is inhabited by goldsmiths.\r\nWithin the court are private dwellings. The front, looking on the great\r\nbridge, is possessed by mountebanks, operators, and puppet-players. On\r\nthe other part, is the every day's market for all sorts of provisions,\r\nespecially bread, herbs, flowers, orange trees, choice shrubs. Here is a\r\nshop called NOAH'S ARK, where are sold all curiosities, natural or\r\nartificial, Indian or European, for luxury or use, as cabinets, shells,\r\nivory, porcelain, dried fishes, insects, birds, pictures, and a thousand\r\nexotic extravagances. Passing hence, we viewed the port Dauphine, an arch\r\nof excellent workmanship; the street bearing the same name, is ample and\r\nstraight.\r\n\r\n4th February, 1644. I went to see the Marais de Temple, where are a noble\r\nchurch and palace, heretofore dedicated to the Knights Templar, now\r\nconverted to a piazza, not much unlike ours at Covent Garden; but large\r\nand not so pleasant, though built all about with divers considerable\r\npalaces.\r\n\r\nThe Church of St. Geneviève is a place of great devotion, dedicated to\r\nanother of their Amazons, said to have delivered the city from the\r\nEnglish; for which she is esteemed the tutelary saint of Paris. It stands\r\non a steep eminence, having a very high spire, and is governed by canons\r\nregular. At the Palais Royal Henry IV. built a fair quadrangle of stately\r\npalaces, arched underneath. In the middle of a spacious area, stands on a\r\nnoble pedestal a brazen statue of Louis XIII., which, though made in\r\nimitation of that in the Roman capitol, is nothing so much esteemed as\r\nthat on the Pont Neuf.\r\n\r\nThe hospital of the Quinze-Vingts, in the Rue St. Honoré, is an excellent\r\nfoundation; but above all is the Hôtel Dieu for men and women, near Nôtre\r\nDame, a princely, pious, and expensive structure. That of the Charité\r\ngave me great satisfaction, in seeing how decently and christianly the\r\nsick people are attended, even to delicacy. I have seen them served by\r\nnoble persons, men and women. They have also gardens, walks, and\r\nfountains. Divers persons are here cut for the stone, with great success,\r\nyearly in May. The two Châtelets (supposed to have been built by Julius\r\nCæsar) are places of judicature in criminal causes; to which is a strong\r\nprison. The courts are spacious and magnificent.\r\n\r\n8th February, 1644. I took coach and went to see the famous Jardine\r\nRoyale, which is an inclosure walled in, consisting of all varieties of\r\nground for planting and culture of medical simples. It is well chosen,\r\nhaving in it hills, meadows, wood and upland, natural and artificial, and\r\nis richly stored with exotic plants. In the middle of the parterre is a\r\nfair fountain. There is a very fine house, chapel, laboratory, orangery,\r\nand other accommodations for the President, who is always one of the\r\nking's chief physicians.\r\n\r\nFrom hence, we went to the other side of the town, and to some distance\r\nfrom it, to the Bois de Vincennes, going by the Bastille, which is the\r\nfortress, tower, and magazine of this great city. It is very spacious\r\nwithin, and there the Grand Master of the artillery has his house, with\r\nfair gardens and walks.\r\n\r\nThe Bois de Vincennes has in it a square and noble castle, with\r\nmagnificent apartments, fit for a royal court, not forgetting the chapel.\r\nIt is the chief prison for persons of quality. About it there is a park\r\nwalled in, full of deer; and in one part there is a grove of goodly pine\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe next day, I went to see the Louvre with more attention, its several\r\ncourts and pavilions. One of the quadrangles, begun by Henry IV., and\r\nfinished by his son and grandson, is a superb, but mixed structure. The\r\ncornices, moldings, and compartments, with the insertion of several\r\ncolored marbles, have been of great expense.\r\n\r\nWe went through the long gallery, paved with white and black marble,\r\nrichly fretted and painted _à fresco_. The front looking to the river,\r\nthough of rare work for the carving, yet wants of that magnificence which\r\na plainer and truer design would have contributed to it.\r\n\r\nIn the Cour aux Tuileries is a princely fabric; the winding geometrical\r\nstone stairs, with the cupola, I take to be as bold and noble a piece of\r\narchitecture as any in Europe of the kind. To this is a _corps de logis_,\r\nworthy of so great a prince. Under these buildings, through a garden in\r\nwhich is an ample fountain, was the king's printing house, and that\r\nfamous letter so much esteemed. Here I bought divers of the classic\r\nauthors, poets, and others.\r\n\r\nWe returned through another gallery, larger, but not so long, where hung\r\nthe pictures of all the kings and queens and prime nobility of France.\r\n\r\nDescending hence, we were let into a lower very large room, called the\r\n_Salle des Antiques_, which is a vaulted Cimelia, destined for statues\r\nonly, among which stands that so celebrated Diana of the Ephesians, said\r\nto be the same which uttered oracles in that renowned Temple. Besides\r\nthese colossean figures of marble, I must not forget the huge globe\r\nsuspended by chains. The pavings, inlayings, and incrustations of this\r\nHall, are very rich.\r\n\r\nIn another more private garden toward the Queen's apartment is a walk, or\r\ncloister, under arches, whose terrace is paved with stones of a great\r\nbreadth; it looks toward the river, and has a pleasant aviary, fountain,\r\nstately cypresses, etc. On the river are seen a prodigious number of\r\nbarges and boats of great length, full of hay, corn, wood, wine, and\r\nother commodities, which this vast city daily consumes. Under the long\r\ngallery we have described, dwell goldsmiths, painters, statuaries, and\r\narchitects, who being the most famous for their art in Christendom have\r\nstipends allowed them by the King. Into that of Monsieur Saracin we\r\nentered, who was then molding for an image of a Madonna to be cast in\r\ngold of a great size to be sent by the Queen Regent to Loretto, as an\r\noffering for the birth of the Dauphin, now the young King.\r\n\r\nI finished this day with a walk in the great garden of the Tuileries,\r\nrarely contrived for privacy, shade, or company, by groves, plantations\r\nof tall trees, especially that in the middle, being of elms, the other of\r\nmulberries; and that labyrinth of cypresses; not omitting the noble\r\nhedges of pomegranates, fountains, fish-ponds, and an aviary; but, above\r\nall, the artificial echo, redoubling the words so distinctly; and, as it\r\nis never without some fair nymph singing to its grateful returns;\r\nstanding at one of the focuses, which is under a tree or little cabinet\r\nof hedges, the voice seems to descend from the clouds; at another, as if\r\nit was underground. This being at the bottom of the garden, we were let\r\ninto another, which being kept with all imaginary accurateness as to the\r\norangery, precious shrubs, and rare fruits, seemed a Paradise. From a\r\nterrace in this place we saw so many coaches, as one would hardly think\r\ncould be maintained in the whole city, going, late as it was in the year,\r\ntoward the course, which is a place adjoining, of near an English mile\r\nlong, planted with four rows of trees, making a large circle in the\r\nmiddle. This course is walled about, near breast high, with squared\r\nfreestone, and has a stately arch at the entrance, with sculpture and\r\nstatues about it, built by Mary di Medicis. Here it is that the gallants\r\nand ladies of the Court take the air and divert themselves, as with us in\r\nHyde Park, the circle being capable of containing a hundred coaches to\r\nturn commodiously, and the larger of the plantations for five or six\r\ncoaches abreast.\r\n\r\nReturning through the Tuileries, we saw a building in which are kept wild\r\nbeasts for the King's pleasure, a bear, a wolf, a wild boar, a leopard,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ST. CLOUD]\r\n\r\n27th February, 1644. Accompanied with some English gentlemen, we took\r\nhorse to see St. Germains-en-Laye, a stately country house of the King,\r\nsome five leagues from Paris. By the way, we alighted at St. Cloud,\r\nwhere, on an eminence near the river, the Archbishop of Paris has a\r\ngarden, for the house is not very considerable, rarely watered and\r\nfurnished with fountains, statues, and groves; the walks are very fair;\r\nthe fountain of Laocoon is in a large square pool, throwing the water\r\nnear forty feet high, and having about it a multitude of statues and\r\nbasins, and is a surprising object. But nothing is more esteemed than the\r\ncascade falling from the great steps into the lowest and longest walk\r\nfrom the Mount Parnassus, which consists of a grotto, or shell-house, on\r\nthe summit of the hill, wherein are divers waterworks and contrivances to\r\nwet the spectators; this is covered with a fair cupola, the walls painted\r\nwith the Muses, and statues placed thick about it, whereof some are\r\nantique and good. In the upper walks are two perspectives, seeming to\r\nenlarge the alleys, and in this garden are many other ingenious\r\ncontrivances. The palace, as I said, is not extraordinary. The outer\r\nwalls only painted _à fresco_. In the court is a Volary, and the statues\r\nof Charles IX., Henry III., IV., and Louis XIII., on horseback,\r\nmezzo-relievo'd in plaster. In the garden is a small chapel; and under\r\nshelter is the figure of Cleopatra, taken from the Belvidere original,\r\nwith others. From the terrace above is a tempest well painted; and thence\r\nan excellent prospect toward Paris, the meadows, and river.\r\n\r\nAt an inn in this village is a host who treats all the great persons in\r\nprincely lodgings for furniture and plate, but they pay well for it, as I\r\nhave done. Indeed, the entertainment is very splendid, and not\r\nunreasonable, considering the excellent manner of dressing their meat,\r\nand of the service. Here are many debauches and excessive revelings, as\r\nbeing out of all noise and observance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ST. GERMAINS]\r\n\r\nFrom hence, about a league further, we went to see Cardinal Richelieu's\r\nvilla, at Ruell. The house is small, but fairly built, in form of a\r\ncastle, moated round. The offices are toward the road, and over against\r\nit are large vineyards, walled in. But, though the house is not of the\r\ngreatest, the gardens about it are so magnificent, that I doubt whether\r\nItaly has any exceeding it for all rarities of pleasure. The garden\r\nnearest the pavilion is a parterre, having in the midst divers noble\r\nbrass statues, perpetually spouting water into an ample basin, with other\r\nfigures of the same metal; but what is most admirable is the vast\r\ninclosure, and variety of ground, in the large garden, containing\r\nvineyards, cornfields, meadows, groves (whereof one is of perennial\r\ngreens), and walks of vast length, so accurately kept and cultivated,\r\nthat nothing can be more agreeable. On one of these walks, within a\r\nsquare of tall trees, is a basilisk of copper, which, managed by the\r\nfountaineer, casts water near sixty feet high, and will of itself move\r\nround so swiftly, that one can hardly escape wetting. This leads to the\r\nCitronière, which is a noble conserve of all those rarities; and at the\r\nend of it is the Arch of Constantine, painted on a wall in oil, as large\r\nas the real one at Rome, so well done, that even a man skilled in\r\npainting, may mistake it for stone and sculpture. The sky and hills,\r\nwhich seem to be between the arches, are so natural, that swallows and\r\nother birds, thinking to fly through, have dashed themselves against the\r\nwall. I was infinitely taken with this agreeable cheat. At the further\r\npart of this walk is that plentiful, though artificial cascade, which\r\nrolls down a very steep declivity, and over the marble steps and basins,\r\nwith an astonishing noise and fury; each basin hath a jetto in it,\r\nflowing like sheets of transparent glass, especially that which rises\r\nover the great shell of lead, from whence it glides silently down a\r\nchannel through the middle of a spacious gravel walk, terminating in a\r\ngrotto. Here are also fountains that cast water to a great height, and\r\nlarge ponds, two of which have islands for harbor of fowls, of which\r\nthere is store. One of these islands has a receptacle for them built of\r\nvast pieces of rock, near fifty feet high, grown over with moss, ivy,\r\netc., shaded at a competent distance with tall trees: in this rupellary\r\nnidary do the fowl lay eggs, and breed. We then saw a large and very rare\r\ngrotto of shell-work, in the shape of Satyrs, and other wild fancies: in\r\nthe middle stands a marble table, on which a fountain plays in divers\r\nforms of glasses, cups, crosses, fans, crowns, etc. Then the fountaineer\r\nrepresented a shower of rain from the top, met by small jets from below.\r\nAt going out, two extravagant musketeers shot us with a stream of water\r\nfrom their musket barrels. Before this grotto is a long pool into which\r\nran divers spouts of water from leaden escalop basins. The viewing this\r\nparadise made us late at St. Germains.\r\n\r\nThe first building of this palace is of Charles V., called the Sage; but\r\nFrancis I. (that true virtuoso) made it complete; speaking as to the\r\nstyle of magnificence then in fashion, which was with too great a mixture\r\nof the Gothic, as may be seen in what there is remaining of his in the\r\nold Castle, an irregular piece as built on the old foundation, and having\r\na moat about it. It has yet some spacious and handsome rooms of state,\r\nand a chapel neatly painted. The new Castle is at some distance, divided\r\nfrom this by a court, of a lower, but more modern design, built by Henry\r\nIV. To this belong six terraces, built of brick and stone, descending in\r\ncascades toward the river, cut out of the natural hill, having under them\r\ngoodly vaulted galleries; of these, four have subterranean grots and\r\nrocks, where are represented several objects in the manner of scenes and\r\nother motions, by force of water, shown by the light of torches only;\r\namong these, is Orpheus with his music; and the animals, which dance\r\nafter his harp; in the second, is the King and Dolphin;[17] in the third,\r\nis Neptune sounding his trumpet, his chariot drawn by sea horses; in the\r\nfourth, the story of Perseus and Andromeda; mills; hermitages; men\r\nfishing; birds chirping; and many other devices. There is also a dry grot\r\nto refresh in; all having a fine prospect toward the river, and the\r\ngoodly country about it, especially the forest. At the bottom, is a\r\nparterre; the upper terrace nearly half a mile in length, with double\r\ndeclivities, arched and balustered with stone, of vast and royal cost.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: Dauphin.]\r\n\r\nIn the pavilion of the new Castle are many fair rooms, well painted, and\r\nleading into a very noble garden and park, where is a pall-mall, in the\r\nmidst of which, on one of the sides, is a chapel, with stone cupola,\r\nthough small, yet of a handsome order of architecture. Out of the park\r\nyou go into the forest, which being very large, is stored with deer, wild\r\nboars, wolves, and other wild game. The Tennis Court, and Cavallerizzo,\r\nfor the menaged horses, are also observable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PARIS]\r\n\r\nWe returned to Paris by Madrid, another villa of the King's, built by\r\nFrancis I., and called by that name to absolve him of his oath that he\r\nwould not go from Madrid (in which he was prisoner), in Spain, but from\r\nwhence he made his escape. This house is also built in a park, and\r\nwalled in. We next called in at the Bonnes-hommes, well situated, with a\r\nfair chapel and library.\r\n\r\n1st March, 1644. I went to see the Count de Liancourt's Palace in the Rue\r\nde Seine, which is well built. Toward his study and bedchamber joins a\r\nlittle garden, which, though very narrow, by the addition of a\r\nwell-painted perspective, is to appearance greatly enlarged; to this\r\nthere is another part, supported by arches in which runs a stream of\r\nwater, rising in the aviary, out of a statue, and seeming to flow for\r\nsome miles, by being artificially continued in the painting, when it\r\nsinks down at the wall. It is a very agreeable deceit. At the end of this\r\ngarden is a little theater, made to change with divers pretty scenes, and\r\nthe stage so ordered, with figures of men and women painted on light\r\nboards, and cut out, and, by a person who stands underneath, made to act\r\nas if they were speaking, by guiding them, and reciting words in\r\ndifferent tones, as the parts require. We were led into a round cabinet,\r\nwhere was a neat invention for reflecting lights, by lining divers\r\nsconces with thin shining plates of gilded copper.\r\n\r\nIn one of the rooms of state was an excellent painting of Poussin, being\r\na Satyr kneeling; over the chimney, the Coronation of the Virgin, by\r\nPaulo Veronese; another Madonna over the door, and that of Joseph, by\r\nCigali; in the Hall, a Cavaliero di Malta, attended by his page, said to\r\nbe of Michael Angelo; the Rape of Proserpine, with a very large landscape\r\nof Correggio. In the next room are some paintings of Primaticcio,\r\nespecially the Helena, the naked Lady brought before Alexander, well\r\npainted, and a Ceres. In the bedchamber a picture of the Cardinal de\r\nLiancourt, of Raphael, rarely colored. In the cabinet are divers pieces\r\nof Bassano, two of Polemburg, four of Paulo Brill, the skies a little too\r\nblue. A Madonna of Nicholao, excellently painted on a stone; a Judith of\r\nMantegna; three women of Jeronimo; one of Stenwick; a Madonna after\r\nTitian, and a Magdalen of the same hand, as the Count esteems it: two\r\nsmall pieces of Paulo Veronese, being the Martyrdoms of St. Justina and\r\nSt. Catherine; a Madonna of Lucas Van Leyden, sent him from our King; six\r\nmore of old Bassano; two excellent drawings of Albert; a Magdalen of\r\nLeonardo da Vinci; four of Paulo; a very rare Madonna of Titian, given\r\nhim also by our King; the _Ecce Homo_, shut up in a frame of velvet, for\r\nthe life and accurate finishing exceeding all description. Some curious\r\nagates, and a chaplet of admirable invention, the intaglios being all on\r\nfruit stones. The Count was so exceeding civil, that he would needs make\r\nhis lady go out of her dressing room, that he might show us the\r\ncuriosities and pictures in it.\r\n\r\nWe went thence to visit one Monsieur Perishot, one of the greatest\r\nvirtuosos in France, for his collection of pictures, agates, medals, and\r\nflowers, especially tulips and anemonies. The chiefest of his paintings\r\nwas a Sebastian, of Titian.\r\n\r\nFrom him we went to Monsieur Frene's, who showed us many rare drawings, a\r\nRape of Helen in black chalk; many excellent things of Sneiders, all\r\nnaked; some of Julio and Michael Angelo; a Madonna of Passignano; some\r\nthings of Parmensis, and other masters.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, being recommended to one Monsieur de Hausse, President\r\nof the Parliament, and once Ambassador at Venice for the French King, we\r\nwere very civilly received, and showed his library. Among his paintings\r\nwere a rare Venus and Adonis of Veronese, a St. Anthony, after the first\r\nmanner of Correggio, and a rare Madonna of Palma.\r\n\r\nSunday, the 6th of March, I went to Charenton, two leagues from Paris, to\r\nhear and see the manner of the French Protestant Church service. The\r\nplace of meeting they call the Temple, a very fair and spacious room,\r\nbuilt of freestone, very decently adorned with paintings of the Tables of\r\nthe Law, the Lord's Prayer, and Creed. The pulpit stands at the upper end\r\nin the middle, having an inclosure of seats about it, where the Elders\r\nand persons of greatest quality and strangers, sit; the rest of the\r\ncongregation on forms and low stools, but none in pews, as in our\r\nchurches, to their great disgrace, as nothing so orderly, as here the\r\nstools and other cumber are removed when the assembly rises. I was\r\ngreatly pleased with their harmonious singing the Psalms, which they all\r\nlearn perfectly well, their children being as duly taught these, as their\r\ncatechism.\r\n\r\nIn our passage, we went by that famous bridge over the Marne, where that\r\nrenowned echo returns the voice of a good singer nine or ten times.\r\n\r\n7th March, 1644. I set forward with some company toward Fontainebleau, a\r\nsumptuous Palace of the King's, like ours at Hampton Court, about\r\nfourteen leagues from the city. By the way, we pass through a forest so\r\nprodigiously encompassed with hideous rocks of whitish hard stone, heaped\r\none on another in mountainous heights, that I think the like is nowhere\r\nto be found more horrid and solitary. It abounds with stags, wolves,\r\nboars, and not long after a lynx, or ounce, was killed among them, which\r\nhad devoured some passengers. On the summit of one of these gloomy\r\nprecipices, intermingled with trees and shrubs, the stones hanging over,\r\nand menacing ruin, is built an hermitage. In these solitudes, rogues\r\nfrequently lurk and do mischief (and for whom we were all well appointed\r\nwith our carabines); but we arrived safe in the evening at the village,\r\nwhere we lay at the Horne, going early next morning to the Palace.\r\n\r\nThis House is nothing so stately and uniform as Hampton Court, but\r\nFrancis I. began much to beautify it; most of all Henry IV. (and not a\r\nlittle) the late King. It abounds with fair halls, chambers, and\r\ngalleries; in the longest, which is 360 feet long, and 18 broad, are\r\npainted the Victories of that great Prince, Henry IV. That of Francis I.,\r\ncalled the grand Gallery, has all the King's palaces painted in it; above\r\nthese, in sixty pieces of excellent work in fresco, is the History of\r\nUlysses, from Homer, by Primaticcio, in the time of Henry III., esteemed\r\nthe most renowned in Europe for the design. The Cabinet is full of\r\nexcellent pictures, especially a Woman, of Raphael. In the Hall of the\r\nGuards is a piece of tapestry painted on the wall, very naturally,\r\nrepresenting the victories of Charles VII. over our countrymen. In the\r\nSalle des Festins is a rare Chimney-piece, and Henry IV. on horseback, of\r\nwhite marble, esteemed worth 18,000 crowns; Clementia and Pax, nobly\r\ndone. On columns of jasper, two lions of brass. The new stairs, and a\r\nhalf circular court, are of modern and good architecture, as is a chapel\r\nbuilt by Louis XIII., all of jasper, with several incrustations of marble\r\nthrough the inside.\r\n\r\nHaving seen the rooms, we went to the volary, which has a cupola in the\r\nmiddle of it, great trees and bushes, it being full of birds who drank at\r\ntwo fountains. There is also a fair tennis court, and noble stables; but\r\nthe beauty of all are the gardens. In the Court of the Fountains stand\r\ndivers antiquities and statues, especially a Mercury. In the Queen's\r\nGarden is a Diana ejecting a fountain, with numerous other brass statues.\r\n\r\nThe great Garden, 180 toises long and 154 wide, has in the center a\r\nfountain of Tyber of a Colossean figure of brass, with the Wolf over\r\nRomulus and Remus. At each corner of the garden rises a fountain. In the\r\ngarden of the piscina, is a Hercules of white marble; next, is that of\r\nthe pines, and without that a canal of an English mile in length, at the\r\nend of which rise three jettos in the form of a fleur-de-lis, of a great\r\nheight; on the margin are excellent walks planted with trees. The carps\r\ncome familiarly to hand (to be fed). Hence they brought us to a spring,\r\nwhich they say being first discovered by a dog, gave occasion of\r\nbeautifying this place, both with the palace and gardens. The white and\r\nterrific rocks at some distance in the forest, yield one of the most\r\naugust and stupendous prospects imaginable. The park about this place is\r\nvery large, and the town full of noblemen's houses.\r\n\r\nNext morning, we were invited by a painter, who was keeper of the\r\npictures and rarities, to see his own collection. We were led through a\r\ngallery of old Rosso's work, at the end of which, in another cabinet,\r\nwere three Madonnas of Raphael, and two of Andrea del Sarto. In the\r\nAcademy where the painter himself wrought, was a St. Michael of Raphael,\r\nvery rare; St. John Baptist of Leonardo, and a Woman's head; a Queen of\r\nSicily, and St. Margaret of Raphael; two more Madonnas, whereof one very\r\nlarge, by the same hand; some more of del Sarto; a St. Jerome, of Perino\r\ndel Vaga; the Rape of Proserpine, very good; and a great number of\r\ndrawings.\r\n\r\nReturning part of our way to Paris, that day, we visited a house called\r\n_Maison Rouge_, having an excellent prospect, grot, and fountains, one\r\nwhereof rises fifty feet, and resembles the noise of a tempest, battle of\r\nguns, etc., at its issue.\r\n\r\nThence to Essone, a house of Monsieur Essling, who is a great virtuoso;\r\nthere are many good paintings in it; but nothing so observable as his\r\ngardens, fountains, fish-pools, especially that in a triangular form, the\r\nwater cast out by a multitude of heads about it; there is a noble\r\ncascade and pretty baths, with all accommodations. Under a marble table\r\nis a fountain of serpents twisting about a globe.\r\n\r\nWe alighted next at Corbeil, a town famous for the siege by Henry IV.\r\nHere we slept, and returned next morning to Paris.\r\n\r\n18th March, 1644. I went with Sir J. Cotton, a Cambridgeshire Knight, a\r\njourney into Normandy. The first day, we passed by Gaillon, the\r\nArchbishop of Rouen's Palace. The gardens are highly commended, but we\r\ndid not go in, intending to reach Pontoise by dinner. This town is built\r\nin a very gallant place, has a noble bridge over the Oise, and is well\r\nrefreshed with fountains.\r\n\r\nThis is the first town in Normandy, and the furthest that the vineyards\r\nextend to on this side of the country, which is fuller of plains, wood,\r\nand inclosures, with some towns toward the sea, very like England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROUEN]\r\n\r\nWe lay this night at a village, called Magny. The next day, descending a\r\nvery steep hill, we dined at Fleury, after riding five leagues down St.\r\nCatherine, to Rouen, which affords a goodly prospect, to the ruins of\r\nthat chapel and mountain. This country so abounds with wolves that a\r\nshepherd whom we met, told us one of his companions was strangled by one\r\nof them the day before, and that in the midst of his flock. The fields\r\nare mostly planted with pears and apples, and other cider fruits. It is\r\nplentifully furnished with quarries of stone and slate, and hath iron in\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\nI lay at the White Cross, in Rouen, which is a very large city, on the\r\nSeine, having two smaller rivers besides, called the Aubette and Robec.\r\nThere stand yet the ruins of a magnificent bridge of stone, now supplied\r\nby one of boats only, to which come up vessels of considerable burden.\r\nThe other side of the water consists of meadows, and there have the\r\nReformed a church.\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral Nôtre Dame was built, as they acknowledge, by the English;\r\nsome English words graven in Gothic characters upon the front seem to\r\nconfirm it. The towers and whole church are full of carving. It has three\r\nsteeples, with a pyramid; in one of these, I saw the famous bell so much\r\ntalked of, thirteen feet in height, thirty-two round, the diameter\r\neleven, weighing 40,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nIn the Chapel d'Amboise, built by a Cardinal of that name, lies his body,\r\nwith several fair monuments. The choir has behind it a great dragon\r\npainted on the wall, which they say had done much harm to the\r\ninhabitants, till vanquished by St. Romain, their Archbishop; for which\r\nthere is an annual procession. It was now near Easter, and many images\r\nwere exposed with scenes and stories representing the Passion; made up of\r\nlittle puppets, to which there was great resort and devotion, with\r\nofferings. Before the church is a fair palace. St. Ouen is another goodly\r\nchurch and an abbey with fine gardens. Here the King hath lodgings, when\r\nhe makes his progress through these parts. The structure, where the Court\r\nof Parliament is kept, is very magnificent, containing very fair halls\r\nand chambers, especially La Chambre Dorée. The town-house is also well\r\nbuilt, and so are some gentlemen's houses; but most part of the rest are\r\nof timber, like our merchants' in London, in the wooden part of the city.\r\n\r\n21st March, 1644. On Easter Monday, we dined at Totes, a solitary inn\r\nbetween Rouen and Dieppe, at which latter place we arrived. This town is\r\nsituated between two mountains, not unpleasantly, and is washed on the\r\nnorth by our English seas.\r\n\r\nThe port is commodious; but the entrance difficult. It has one very ample\r\nand fair street, in which is a pretty church. The Fort Pollet consists of\r\na strong earth-work, and commands the haven, as on the other side does\r\nthe castle, which is also well fortified, with the citadel before it; nor\r\nis the town itself a little strong. It abounds with workmen, who make and\r\nsell curiosities of ivory and tortoise-shells; and indeed whatever the\r\nEast Indies afford of cabinets, porcelain, natural and exotic rarities,\r\nare here to be had, with abundant choice.\r\n\r\n23d March, 1644. We passed along the coast by a very rocky and rugged\r\nway, which forced us to alight many times before we came to Havre de\r\nGrace, where we lay that night.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we saw the citadel, strong and regular, well stored\r\nwith artillery and ammunition of all sorts: the works furnished with fair\r\nbrass cannon, having a motto, _Ratio ultima Regum_. The allogements of\r\nthe garrison are uniform; a spacious place for drawing up the soldiers,\r\na pretty chapel, and a fair house for the Governor. The Duke of Richelieu\r\nbeing now in the fort, we went to salute him; who received us very\r\ncivilly, and commanded that we should be showed whatever we desired to\r\nsee. The citadel was built by the late Cardinal de Richelieu, uncle of\r\nthe present Duke, and may be esteemed one of the strongest in France. The\r\nhaven is very capacious.\r\n\r\nWhen we had done here, we embarked ourselves and horses to pass to\r\nHonfleur, about four or five leagues distant, where the Seine falls into\r\nthe sea. It is a poor fisher-town, remarkable for nothing so much as the\r\nodd, yet useful habits which the good women wear, of bears' and other\r\nskins, as of rugs at Dieppe, and all along these maritime coasts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAEN]\r\n\r\n25th March, 1644. We arrived at Caen, a noble and beautiful town, situate\r\non the river Orne, which passes quite through it, the two sides of the\r\ntown joined only by a bridge of one entire arch. We lay at the Angel,\r\nwhere we were very well used, the place being abundantly furnished with\r\nprovisions, at a cheap rate. The most considerable object is the great\r\nAbbey and Church, large and rich, built after the Gothic manner, having\r\ntwo spires and middle lantern at the west end, all of stone. The choir\r\nround and large, in the center whereof elevated on a square, handsome,\r\nbut plain sepulcher, is this inscription:\r\n\r\n    \"Hoc sepulchrum invictissimi juxta et clementissimi conquestoris,\r\n    Gulielmi, dum viverat Anglorum Regis, Normannorum Cenomannorumque\r\n    Principis, hujus insignis Abbatiae piissimi Fundatoris: Cum anno\r\n    1562 vesano hæreticorum furore direptum fuisset, pio tandem\r\n    nobilium ejusdem Abbatiae religiosorum gratitudinis sensu in tam\r\n    beneficum largitorem, instauratum fuit, a^o D'ni 1642. D'no Johanne\r\n    de Bailhache Assætorii proto priore. D.D.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other side are these monkish rhymes:\r\n\r\n    \"Qui rexit rigidos Northmannos, atq. Britannos\r\n      Audacter vicit, fortiter obtinuit,\r\n    Et Cenomanensis virtute coërcuit ensis,\r\n      Imperiique sui Legibus applicuit.\r\n    Rex magnus parvâ jacet hâc Gulielm' in Urnâ,\r\n      Sufficit et magno parva domus Domino.\r\n    Ter septem gradibus te volverat atq. duobus\r\n      Virginis in gremio Phoebus, et hic obiit.\"\r\n\r\nWe went to the castle, which is strong and fair, and so is the\r\ntown-house, built on the bridge which unites the two towns. Here are\r\nschools and an University for the Jurists.\r\n\r\nThe whole town is handsomely built of that excellent stone so well known\r\nby that name in England. I was led to a pretty garden, planted with\r\nhedges of alaternus, having at the entrance a screen at an exceeding\r\nheight, accurately cut in topiary work, with well understood\r\narchitecture, consisting of pillars, niches, friezes, and other\r\nornaments, with great curiosity; some of the columns curiously wreathed,\r\nothers spiral, all according to art.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PARIS]\r\n\r\n28th March, 1644. We went toward Paris, lying the first night at Evreux,\r\na Bishop's seat, an ancient town, with a fair cathedral; so the next day\r\nwe arrived at Paris.\r\n\r\n1st April, 1644. I went to see more exactly the rooms of the fine Palace\r\nof Luxemburg, in the Fauxbourg St. Germains, built by Mary di Medicis,\r\nand I think one of the most noble, entire, and finished piles that is to\r\nbe seen, taking it with the garden and all its accomplishments. The\r\ngallery is of the painting of Rubens, being the history of the\r\nFoundress's Life, rarely designed; at the end of it is the Duke of\r\nOrleans' library, well furnished with excellent books, all bound in\r\nmaroquin and gilded, the valance of the shelves being of green velvet,\r\nfringed with gold. In the cabinet joining to it are only the smaller\r\nvolumes, with six cabinets of medals, and an excellent collection of\r\nshells and agates, whereof some are prodigiously rich. This Duke being\r\nvery learned in medals and plants, nothing of that kind escapes him.\r\nThere are other spacious, noble, and princely furnished rooms, which look\r\ntoward the gardens, which are nothing inferior to the rest.\r\n\r\nThe court below is formed into a square by a corridor, having over the\r\nchief entrance a stately cupola, covered with stone: the rest is\r\ncloistered and arched on pilasters of rustic work. The terrace ascending\r\nbefore the front, paved with white and black marble, is balustered with\r\nwhite marble, exquisitely polished.\r\n\r\nOnly the hall below is low, and the staircase somewhat of a heavy design,\r\nbut the facia toward the parterre which is also arched and vaulted with\r\nstone, is of admirable beauty and full of sculpture.\r\n\r\nThe gardens are near an English mile in compass, inclosed with a stately\r\nwall, and in a good air. The parterre is indeed of box, but so rarely\r\ndesigned and accurately kept cut, that the embroidery makes a wonderful\r\neffect to the lodgings which front it. 'Tis divided into four squares and\r\nas many circular knots, having in the center a noble basin of marble near\r\nthirty feet in diameter (as I remember), in which a Triton of brass holds\r\na dolphin, that casts a girandola of water near thirty feet high, playing\r\nperpetually, the water being conveyed from Arceuil by an aqueduct of\r\nstone, built after the old Roman magnificence. About this ample parterre,\r\nthe spacious walks and all included, runs a border of freestone, adorned\r\nwith pedestals for pots and statues, and part of it near the steps of the\r\nterrace, with a rail and baluster of pure white marble.\r\n\r\nThe walks are exactly fair, long, and variously descending and so justly\r\nplanted with limes, elms, and other trees, that nothing can be more\r\ndelicious, especially that of the hornbeam hedge, which being high and\r\nstately, buts full on the fountain.\r\n\r\nToward the further end, is an excavation intended for a vast fish-pool,\r\nbut never finished, and near it is an inclosure for a garden of simples,\r\nwell kept; and here the Duke keeps tortoises in great number, who use the\r\npool of water on one side of the garden. Here is also a conservatory for\r\nsnow. At the upper part, toward the palace, is a grove of tall elms cut\r\ninto a star, every ray being a walk, whose center is a large fountain.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the ground is made into several inclosures (all hedge-work or\r\nrows of trees) of whole fields, meadows, bocages, some of them containing\r\ndivers acres.\r\n\r\nNext the street side, and more contiguous to the house, are knots in\r\ntrail, or grass work, where likewise runs a fountain. Toward the grotto\r\nand stables, within a wall, is a garden of choice flowers, in which the\r\nduke spends many thousand pistoles. In sum, nothing is wanted to render\r\nthis palace and gardens perfectly beautiful and magnificent; nor is it\r\none of the least diversions to see the number of persons of quality,\r\ncitizens and strangers, who frequent it, and to whom all access is freely\r\npermitted, so that you shall see some walks and retirements full of\r\ngallants and ladies; in others melancholy friars; in others, studious\r\nscholars; in others, jolly citizens, some sitting or lying on the grass,\r\nothers running and jumping; some playing at bowls and ball, others\r\ndancing and singing; and all this without the least disturbance, by\r\nreason of the largeness of the place.\r\n\r\nWhat is most admirable, you see no gardeners, or men at work, and yet all\r\nis kept in such exquisite order, as if they did nothing else but work; it\r\nis so early in the morning, that all is dispatched and done without the\r\nleast confusion.\r\n\r\nI have been the larger in the description of this paradise, for the\r\nextraordinary delight I have taken in those sweet retirements. The\r\nCabinet and Chapel nearer the garden-front have some choice pictures. All\r\nthe houses near this are also very noble palaces, especially Petite\r\nLuxemburg. The ascent of the street is handsome from its breadth,\r\nsituation, and buildings.\r\n\r\nI went next to view Paris from the top of St. Jacques' steeple, esteemed\r\nthe highest in the town, from whence I had a full view of the whole city\r\nand suburbs, both which, as I judge, are not so large as London: though\r\nthe dissimilitude of their several forms and situations, this being\r\nround, London long,--renders it difficult to determine; but there is no\r\ncomparison between the buildings, palaces, and materials, this being\r\nentirely of stone and more sumptuous, though I esteem our piazzas to\r\nexceed theirs.\r\n\r\nHence I took a turn in St. Innocent's churchyard, where the story of the\r\ndevouring quality of the ground (consuming bodies in twenty-four hours),\r\nthe vast charnels of bones, tombs, pyramids, and sepulchers, took up much\r\nof my time, together with the hieroglyphical characters of Nicholas\r\nFlamel's philosophical work, who had founded this church, and divers\r\nother charitable establishments, as he testifies in his book.\r\n\r\nHere divers clerks get their livelihood by inditing letters for poor\r\nmaids and other ignorant people who come to them for advice, and to write\r\nfor them into the country, both to their sweethearts, parents, and\r\nfriends; every large gravestone serving for a table. Joining to this\r\nchurch is a common fountain, with good relievos upon it.\r\n\r\nThe next day I was carried to see a French gentleman's curious\r\ncollection, which abounded in fair and rich jewels of all sorts of\r\nprecious stones, most of them of great sizes and value; agates and\r\nonyxes, some of them admirably colored and antique; nor inferior were his\r\nlandscapes from the best hands, most of which he had caused to be copied\r\nin miniature; one of which, rarely painted on stone, was broken by one of\r\nour company, by the mischance of setting it up: but such was the temper\r\nand civility of the gentleman, that it altered nothing of his free and\r\nnoble humor.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, I was had by a friend to the garden of Monsieur Morine,\r\nwho, from being an ordinary gardener, is become one of the most skillful\r\nand curious persons in France for his rare collection of shells, flowers,\r\nand insects.\r\n\r\nHis garden is of an exact oval figure, planted with cypress, cut flat and\r\nset as even as a wall: the tulips, anemones, ranunculuses, crocuses,\r\netc., are held to be of the rarest, and draw all the admirers of that\r\nkind to his house during the season. He lived in a kind of hermitage at\r\none side of his garden, where his collection of porcelain and coral,\r\nwhereof one is carved into a large crucifix, is much esteemed. He has\r\nalso books of prints, by Albert [Durer], Van Leyden, Callot, etc. His\r\ncollection of all sorts of insects, especially of butterflies, is most\r\ncurious; these he spreads and so medicates, that no corruption invading\r\nthem, he keeps them in drawers, so placed as to represent a beautiful\r\npiece of tapestry.\r\n\r\nHe showed me the remarks he had made on their propagation, which he\r\npromised to publish. Some of these, as also of his best flowers, he had\r\ncaused to be painted in miniature by rare hands, and some in oil.\r\n\r\n6th April, 1644. I sent my sister my own picture in water colors,[18]\r\nwhich she requested of me, and went to see divers of the fairest palaces\r\nof the town, as that of Vendôme, very large and stately; Lougueville;\r\nGuise; Condé; Chevereuse; Nevers, esteemed one of the best in Paris\r\ntoward the river.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: In the first and second editions of the \"Diary\" many\r\n    trifling personal details, such as this mention of the author having\r\n    sent his own picture in water colors to his sister, were omitted. It\r\n    is not necessary to point them out in detail. They are always of\r\n    this personal character; as, among other examples, the mention of\r\n    the wet weather preventing the diarist from stirring out, and that\r\n    of his coming weary to his lodgings.]\r\n\r\nI often went to the Palais Cardinal, bequeathed by Richelieu to the King,\r\non condition that it should be called by his name; at this time, the King\r\nresided in it, because of the building of the Louvre. It is a very noble\r\nhouse, though somewhat low; the galleries, paintings of the most\r\nillustrious persons of both sexes, the Queen's baths, presence-chamber\r\nwith its rich carved and gilded roof, theater, and large garden, in which\r\nis an ample fountain, grove, and mall, worthy of remark. Here I also\r\nfrequently went to see them ride and exercise the great horse, especially\r\nat the Academy of Monsieur du Plessis, and de Veau, whose schools of that\r\nart are frequented by the nobility; and here also young gentlemen are\r\ntaught to fence, dance, play on music, and something in fortification and\r\nthe mathematics. The design is admirable, some keeping near a hundred\r\nbrave horses, all managed to the great saddle.\r\n\r\n12th April, 1644. I took coach, to see a general muster of all the _gens\r\nd'armes_ about the city, in the Bois de Boulogne, before their Majesties\r\nand all the Grandees. They were reputed to be near 20,000, besides the\r\nspectators, who much exceeded them in number. Here they performed all\r\ntheir motions; and, being drawn up, horse and foot, into several figures,\r\nrepresented a battle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ORLEANS]\r\n\r\nThe summer now drawing near, I determined to spend the rest of it in some\r\nmore remote town on the river Loire; and, on 19th of April, I took leave\r\nof Paris, and, by the way of the messenger, agreed for my passage to\r\nOrleans.\r\n\r\nThe way from Paris to this city, as indeed most of the roads in France,\r\nis paved with a small square freestone, so that the country does not much\r\nmolest the traveler with dirt and ill way, as in England, only 'tis\r\nsomewhat hard to the poor horses' feet, which causes them to ride more\r\ntemperately, seldom going out of the trot, or _grand pas_, as they call\r\nit. We passed divers walled towns, or villages; among others of note,\r\nChartres and Etampes, where we lay the first night. This has a fair\r\nchurch. The next day, we had an excellent road; but had liked to come\r\nshort home: for no sooner were we entered two or three leagues into the\r\nForest of Orleans (which extends itself many miles), but the company\r\nbehind us were set on by rogues, who, shooting from the hedges and\r\nfrequent covert, slew four upon the spot. Among the slain was a captain\r\nof Swiss, of the regiment of Picardy, a person much lamented. This\r\ndisaster made such an alarm in Orleans at our arrival, that the Prevôt\r\nMarshal, with his assistants, going in pursuit, brought in two whom they\r\nhad shot, and exposed them in the great market place, to see if any would\r\ntake cognizance of them. I had great cause to give God thanks for this\r\nescape; when coming to Orleans and lying at the White Cross, I found Mr.\r\nJohn Nicholas, eldest son to Mr. Secretary. In the night a cat kittened\r\non my bed, and left on it a young one having six ears, eight legs, two\r\nbodies from the middle downward, and two tails. I found it dead, but\r\nwarm, in the morning when I awaked.\r\n\r\n21st April, 1644. I went about to view the city, which is well built of\r\nstone, on the side of the Loire. About the middle of the river is an\r\nisland, full of walks and fair trees, with some houses. This is\r\ncontiguous to the town by a stately stone bridge, reaching to the\r\nopposite suburbs, built likewise on the edge of a hill, from whence is a\r\nbeautiful prospect. At one of the extremes of the bridge are strong\r\ntowers, and about the middle, on one side, is the statue of the Virgin\r\nMary, or Pieta, with the dead Christ in her lap, as big as the life. At\r\none side of the cross, kneels Charles VII., armed, and at the other Joan\r\nd'Arc, armed also like a cavalier, with boots and spurs, her hair\r\ndisheveled, as the deliveress of the town from our countrymen, when they\r\nbesieged it. The figures are all cast in copper, with a pedestal full of\r\ninscriptions, as well as a fair column joining it, which is all adorned\r\nwith fleurs-de-lis and a crucifix, with two saints proceeding (as it\r\nwere) from two branches out of its capital. The inscriptions on the cross\r\nare in Latin: \"_Mors Christi in cruce nos á contagione, labis et\r\næternorum morborum sanavit_.\" On the pedestal: \"_Rex in hoc signo hostes\r\nprofligavit, et Johanna Virgo Aureliam obsidio liberavit. Non diu ab\r\nimpiis diruta, restituta sunt hoc anno D'ni 1578. Jean Buret, m.\r\nf._\"--\"_Octannoque Galliam servitute Britannicâ liberavit. A Domino factum\r\nest illud, et est mirabile in oculis nostris; in quorum memorià hæc\r\nnostræ fidei Insignia_.\" To this is made an annual procession on 12th of\r\nMay, mass being sung before it, attended with great ceremony and\r\nconcourse of people. The wine of this place is so strong, that the King's\r\ncup bearers are, as I was assured, sworn never to give the King any of\r\nit: but it is a very noble liquor, and much of it transported into other\r\ncountries. The town is much frequented by strangers, especially Germans,\r\nfor the great purity of the language here spoken, as well as for divers\r\nother privileges, and the University, which causes the English to make no\r\nlong sojourn here, except such as can drink and debauch. The city stands\r\nin the county of Bealse (Blaisois); was once styled a Kingdom, afterward\r\na Duchy, as at present, belonging to the second son of France. Many\r\nCouncils have been held here, and some Kings crowned. The University is\r\nvery ancient, divided now by the students into that of four nations,\r\nFrench, High Dutch, Normans, and Picardines, who have each their\r\nrespective protectors, several officers, treasurers, consuls, seals, etc.\r\nThere are in it two reasonable fair public libraries, whence one may\r\nborrow a book to one's chamber, giving but a note under hand, which is an\r\nextraordinary custom, and a confidence that has cost many libraries dear.\r\nThe first church I went to visit was St. Croix; it has been a stately\r\nfabric, but now much ruined by the late civil wars. They report the tower\r\nof it to have been the highest in France. There is the beginning of a\r\nfair reparation. About this cathedral there is a very spacious cemetery.\r\nThe townhouse is also very nobly built, with a high tower to it. The\r\nmarket place and streets, some whereof are deliciously planted with\r\nlimes, are ample and straight, so well paved with a kind of pebble, that\r\nI have not seen a neater town in France. In fine, this city was by\r\nFrancis I. esteemed the most agreeable of his vast dominions.\r\n\r\n28th April, 1644. Taking boat on the Loire, I went toward Blois, the\r\npassage and river being both very pleasant. Passing Mehun, we dined at\r\nBaugenci, and slept at a little town called St. Dieu. Quitting our bark,\r\nwe hired horses to Blois, by the way of Chambord, a famous house of the\r\nKing's, built by Francis I. in the middle of a solitary park, full of\r\ndeer, inclosed with a wall. I was particularly desirous of seeing this\r\npalace, from the extravagance of the design, especially the staircase,\r\nmentioned by Palladio. It is said that 1800 workmen were constantly\r\nemployed in this fabric for twelve years: if so, it is wonderful that it\r\nwas not finished, it being no greater than divers gentlemen's houses in\r\nEngland, both for room and circuit. The carvings are indeed very rich and\r\nfull. The staircase is devised with four entries, or assents, which cross\r\none another, so that though four persons meet, they never come in sight,\r\nbut by small loopholes, till they land. It consists of 274 steps (as I\r\nremember), and is an extraordinary work, but of far greater expense than\r\nuse or beauty. The chimneys of the house appear like so many towers.\r\nAbout the whole is a large deep moat. The country about is full of corn,\r\nand wine, with many fair noblemen's houses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BLOIS]\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Blois in the evening. The town is hilly, uneven, and\r\nrugged, standing on the side of the Loire, having suburbs joined by a\r\nstately stone bridge, on which is a pyramid with an inscription. At the\r\nentrance of the castle is a stone statue of Louis XII. on horseback, as\r\nlarge as life, under a Gothic state; and a little below are these words:\r\n\r\n    \"Hic ubi natus erat dextro Ludovicus Olympo,\r\n      Sumpsit honoratâ regia sceptra manu;\r\n    Felix quæ tanti fulsit Lux nuncia Regis!\r\n      Gallica non alio principe digna fuit.\"\r\n\r\nUnder this is a very wide pair of gates, nailed full of wolves and\r\nwild-boars' heads. Behind the castle the present Duke Gaston had begun a\r\nfair building, through which we walked into a large garden, esteemed for\r\nits furniture one of the fairest, especially for simples and exotic\r\nplants, in which he takes extraordinary delight. On the right hand is a\r\nlong gallery full of ancient statues and inscriptions, both of marble and\r\nbrass; the length, 300 paces, divides the garden into higher and lower\r\nground, having a very noble fountain. There is the portrait of a hart,\r\ntaken in the forest by Louis XII., which has twenty-four antlers on its\r\nhead. In the Collegiate Church of St. Savior, we saw many sepulchres of\r\nthe Earls of Blois.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, being May-day, we walked up into Pall Mall, very long, and so\r\nnoble shaded with tall trees (being in the midst of a great wood), that\r\nunless that of Tours, I had not seen a statelier.\r\n\r\nFrom hence, we proceeded with a friend of mine through the adjoining\r\nforest, to see if we could meet any wolves, which are here in such\r\nnumbers that they often come and take children out of the very streets;\r\nyet will not the Duke, who is sovereign here, permit them to be\r\ndestroyed. We walked five or six miles outright; but met with none; yet a\r\ngentleman, who was resting himself under a tree, with his horse grazing\r\nby him, told us that half an hour before, two wolves had set upon his\r\nhorse, and had in probability devoured him, but for a dog which lay by\r\nhim. At a little village at the end of this wood, we ate excellent cream,\r\nand visited a castle builded on a very steep cliff.\r\n\r\nBlois is a town where the language is exactly spoken; the inhabitants\r\nvery courteous; the air so good, that it is the ordinary nursery of the\r\nKing's children. The people are so ingenious, that, for goldsmith's work\r\nand watches, no place in France affords the like. The pastures by the\r\nriver are very rich and pleasant.\r\n\r\n2d May, 1644. We took boat again, passing by Charmont, a proud castle on\r\nthe left hand; before it is a sweet island, deliciously shaded with tall\r\ntrees. A little distance from hence, we went on shore at Amboise, a very\r\nagreeable village, built of stone, and the houses covered with blue\r\nslate, as the towns on the Loire generally are; but the castle chiefly\r\ninvited us, the thickness of whose towers from the river to the top, was\r\nadmirable. We entered by the drawbridge, which has an invention to let\r\none fall, if not premonished. It is full of halls and spacious chambers,\r\nand one staircase is large enough, and sufficiently commodious, to\r\nreceive a coach, and land it on the very tower, as they told us had been\r\ndone. There is some artillery in it; but that which is most observable is\r\nin the ancient chapel, viz, a stag's head, or branches, hung up by\r\nchains, consisting of twenty browantlers, the beam bigger than a man's\r\nmiddle, and of an incredible length. Indeed, it is monstrous, and yet I\r\ncannot conceive how it should be artificial they show also the ribs and\r\nvertebræ of the same beast; but these might be made of whalebone.\r\n\r\nLeaving the castle, we passed Mont Louis, a village having no houses\r\nabove ground but such only as are hewn out of the main rocks of excellent\r\nfreestone. Here and there the funnel of a chimney appears on the surface\r\namong the vineyards which are over them, and in this manner they inhabit\r\nthe caves, as it were sea-cliffs, on one side of the river for many\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TOURS]\r\n\r\nWe now came within sight of Tours, where we were designed for the rest of\r\nthe time I had resolved to stay in France, the sojournment being so\r\nagreeable. Tours is situate on the east side of a hill on the river\r\nLoire, having a fair bridge of stone called St. Edme; the streets are\r\nvery long, straight, spacious, well built, and exceeding clean; the\r\nsuburbs large and pleasant, joined to the city by another bridge. Both\r\nthe church and monastery of St. Martin are large, of Gothic building,\r\nhaving four square towers, fair organs, and a stately altar, where they\r\nshow the bones and ashes of St. Martin, with other relics. The Mall\r\nwithout comparison is the noblest in Europe for length and shade, having\r\nseven rows of the tallest and goodliest elms I had ever beheld, the\r\ninnermost of which do so embrace each other, and at such a height, that\r\nnothing can be more solemn and majestical. Here we played a party, or\r\nparty or two, and then walked about the town walls, built of square\r\nstone, filled with earth, and having a moat. No city in France exceeds it\r\nin beauty, or delight.\r\n\r\n6th May, 1644. We went to St. Gatian, reported to have been built by our\r\ncountrymen; the dial and clockwork are much esteemed. The church has two\r\nhandsome towers and spires of stone, and the whole fabric is very noble\r\nand venerable. To this joins the palace of the Archbishop, consisting\r\nboth of old and new building, with many fair rooms, and a fair garden.\r\nHere I grew acquainted with one Monsieur Merey, a very good musician. The\r\nArchbishop treated me very courteously. We visited divers other churches,\r\nchapels, and monasteries for the most part neatly built, and full of\r\npretty paintings, especially the Convent of the Capuchins, which has a\r\nprospect over the whole city, and many fair walks.\r\n\r\n8th May, 1644. I went to see their manufactures in silk (for in this town\r\nthey drive a very considerable trade with silk-worms), their pressing and\r\nwatering the grograms and camlets, with weights of an extraordinary\r\npoise, put into a rolling engine. Here I took a master of the language,\r\nand studied the tongue very diligently, recreating myself sometimes at\r\nthe Mall, and sometimes about the town. The house opposite my lodging had\r\nbeen formerly a King's palace; the outside was totally covered with\r\nfleur-de-lis, embossed out of the stone. Here Mary de Medicis held her\r\nCourt, when she was compelled to retire from Paris by the persecution of\r\nthe great Cardinal.\r\n\r\n25th May, 1644. Was the Fête Dieu, and a goodly procession of all the\r\nreligious orders, the whole streets hung with their best tapestries, and\r\ntheir most precious movables exposed; silks, damasks, velvets, plate, and\r\npictures in abundance; the streets strewed with flowers, and full of\r\npageantry, banners, and bravery.\r\n\r\n6th June, 1644. I went by water to visit that goodly and venerable Abbey\r\nof Marmoutiers, being one of the greatest in the kingdom; to it is a very\r\nample church of stone, with a very high pyramid. Among other relics the\r\nMonks showed us is the Holy Ampoulle, the same with that which sacres\r\ntheir Kings at Rheims, this being the one that anointed Henry IV.\r\nAscending many steps, we went into the Abbot's Palace, where we were\r\nshowed a vast tun (as big as that at Heidelberg), which they report St.\r\nMartin (as I remember) filled from one cluster of grapes growing there.\r\n\r\n7th June, 1644. We walked about two miles from the city to an agreeable\r\nsolitude, called Du Plessis, a house belonging to the King. It has many\r\npretty gardens, full of nightingales; and, in the chapel, lies buried the\r\nfamous poet, Ronsard.\r\n\r\nReturning, we stepped into a Convent of Franciscans, called St. Cosmo,\r\nwhere the cloister is painted with the miracles of their St. Francis à\r\nPaula, whose ashes lie in their chapel, with this inscription: \"_Corpus\r\nSancti Fran. à Paula 1507, 13 Aprilis, concrematur verò ab Hæreticis anno\r\n1562, cujus quidem ossa et cineres hìc jacent_.\" The tomb has four small\r\npyramids of marble at each corner.\r\n\r\n9th June, 1644. I was invited to a vineyard, which was so artificially\r\nplanted and supported with arched poles, that stooping down one might see\r\nfrom end to end, a very great length, under the vines, the bunches\r\nhanging down in abundance.\r\n\r\n20th June, 1644. We took horse to see certain natural caves, called\r\nGouttière, near Colombière, where there is a spring within the bowels of\r\nthe earth, very deep and so excessive cold, that the drops meeting with\r\nsome lapidescent matter, it converts them into a hard stone, which hangs\r\nabout it like icicles, having many others in the form of comfitures and\r\nsugar plums, as we call them.\r\n\r\nNear this, we went under the ground almost two furlongs, lighted with\r\ncandles, to see the source and spring which serves the whole city, by a\r\npassage cut through the main rock of freestone.\r\n\r\n28th June, 1644. I went to see the palace and gardens of Chevereux, a\r\nsweet place.\r\n\r\n30th June, 1644. I walked through the vineyards as far as Roche Corbé, to\r\nthe ruins of an old and very strong castle, said to have been built by\r\nthe English, of great height, on the precipice of a dreadful cliff, from\r\nwhence the country and river yield a most incomparable prospect.\r\n\r\n27th July, 1644. I heard excellent music at the Jesuits, who have here a\r\nschool and convent, but a mean chapel. We have now store of those\r\nadmirable melons, so much celebrated in France for the best in the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\n1st August, 1644. My valet, one Garro, a Spaniard, born in Biscao, having\r\nmisbehaved, I was forced to discharge him; he demanded of me (besides his\r\nwages) no less than 100 crowns to carry him to his country; refusing to\r\npay it, as no part of our agreement, he had the impudence to arrest me;\r\nthe next day I was to appear in Court, where both our avocats pleaded\r\nbefore the Lieutenant Civil; but it was so unreasonable a pretense, that\r\nthe Judge had not patience to hear it out. The Judge immediately\r\nacquitted me, after he had reproached the avocat who took part with my\r\nservant, he rose from the Bench, and making a courteous excuse to me,\r\nthat being a stranger I should be so used, he conducted me through the\r\ncourt to the street-door. This varlet afterward threatened to pistol me.\r\nThe next day, I waited on the Lieutenant, to thank him for his great\r\ncivility.\r\n\r\n18th August, 1644. The Queen of England came to Tours, having newly\r\narrived in France, and going for Paris. She was very nobly received by\r\nthe people and clergy, who went to meet her with the trained bands.\r\nAfter the harangue, the Archbishop entertained her at his Palace, where I\r\npaid my duty to her. The 20th she set forward to Paris.\r\n\r\n8th September, 1644. Two of my kinsmen came from Paris to this place,\r\nwhere I settled them in their pension and exercises.\r\n\r\n14th September, 1644. We took post for Richelieu, passing by l'Isle\r\nBouchard, a village in the way. The next day, we arrived, and went to see\r\nthe Cardinal's Palace, near it. The town is built in a low, marshy\r\nground, having a narrow river cut by hand, very even and straight,\r\ncapable of bringing up a small vessel. It consists of only one\r\nconsiderable street, the houses on both sides (as indeed throughout the\r\ntown) built exactly uniform, after a modern handsome design. It has a\r\nlarge goodly market house and place, opposite to which is the church\r\nbuilt of freestone, having two pyramids of stone, which stand hollow from\r\nthe towers. The church is well built, and of a well-ordered architecture,\r\nwithin handsomely paved and adorned. To this place belongs an Academy,\r\nwhere, besides the exercise of the horse, arms, dancing, etc., all the\r\nsciences are taught in the vulgar French by professors stipendiated by\r\nthe great Cardinal, who by this, the cheap living there, and divers\r\nprivileges, not only designed the improvement of the vulgar language, but\r\nto draw people and strangers to the town; but since the Cardinal's death,\r\nit is thinly inhabited; standing so much out of the way, and in a place\r\nnot well situated for health, or pleasure. He was allured to build by the\r\nname of the place, and an old house there belonging to his ancestors.\r\nThis pretty town is handsomely walled about and moated, with a kind of\r\nslight fortification, two fair gates and drawbridges. Before the gate,\r\ntoward the palace, is a spacious circle, where the fair is annually kept.\r\nAbout a flight-shot from the town is the Cardinal's house, a princely\r\npile, though on an old design, not altogether Gothic, but mixed, and\r\nenvironed by a clear moat. The rooms are stately, most richly furnished\r\nwith tissue, damask, arras, and velvet, pictures, statues, vases, and all\r\nsorts of antiquities, especially the Cæsars, in oriental alabaster. The\r\nlong gallery is painted with the famous acts of the Founder; the roof\r\nwith the life of Julius Cæsar; at the end of it is a cupola, or singing\r\ntheatre, supported by very stately pillars of black marble. The chapel\r\nanciently belonged to the family of the Founder. The court is very ample.\r\nThe gardens without are very large, and the parterres of excellent\r\nembroidery, set with many statues of brass and marble; the groves,\r\nmeadows, and walks are a real Paradise.\r\n\r\n16th September, 1644. We returned to Tours, from whence, after nineteen\r\nweeks' sojourn, we traveled toward the more southern part of France,\r\nminding now to shape my course so, as I might winter in Italy. With my\r\nfriend, Mr. Thicknesse, and our guide, we went the first day seven\r\nleagues to a castle called Chenonceau, built by Catherine de Medicis, and\r\nnow belonging to the Duke de Vendôme, standing on a bridge. In the\r\ngallery, among divers other excellent statues, is that of Scipio\r\nAfricanus, of oriental alabaster.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BOURGES]\r\n\r\n21st September, 1644. We passed by Villefranche, where we dined, and so\r\nby Muneton, lying at Viaron-au-mouton, which was twenty leagues. The next\r\nday by Murg to Bourges, four leagues, where we spent the day. This is the\r\ncapital of Berry, an University much frequented by the Dutch, situated on\r\nthe river Eure. It stands high, is strong, and well placed for defense;\r\nis environed with meadows and vines, and the living here is very cheap.\r\nIn the suburbs of St. Privé, there is a fountain of sharp water which\r\nthey report wholesome against the stone. They showed us a vast tree which\r\nthey say stands in the center of France. The French tongue is spoken with\r\ngreat purity in this place. St. Stephen's church is the cathedral, well\r\nbuilt _à la Gothique_, full of sepulchres without-side, with the\r\nrepresentation of the final Judgment over one of the ports. Here they\r\nshow the chapel of Claude de la Chastre, a famous soldier who had served\r\nsix kings of France in their wars. St. Chapelle is built much like that\r\nat Paris, full of relics, and containing the bones of one Briat, a giant\r\nof fifteen cubits high. It was erected by John, Duke of Berry, and there\r\nis showed the coronet of the dukedom. The great tower is a Pharos for\r\ndefense of the town, very strong, in thickness eighteen feet, fortified\r\nwith graffs and works; there is a garrison in it, and a strange engine\r\nfor throwing great stones, and the iron cage where Louis, Duke of\r\nOrleans, was kept by Charles VIII. Near the Town-house stands the College\r\nof Jesuits, where was heretofore an Amphitheater. I was courteously\r\nentertained by a Jesuit, who had us into the garden, where we fell into\r\ndisputation. The house of Jaques Coeur is worth seeing. Bourges is an\r\nArchbishopric and Primacy of Aquitaine. I took my leave of Mr. Nicholas,\r\nand some other English there; and, on the 23d, proceeded on my journey by\r\nPont du Charge; and lay that evening at Coulaiure, thirteen leagues.\r\n\r\n24th September, 1644. By Franchesse, St. Menoux, thence to Moulins, where\r\nwe dined. This is the chief town of the Bourbonnois, on the river Allier,\r\nvery navigable. The streets are fair; the castle has a noble prospect,\r\nand has been the seat of the Dukes. Here is a pretty park and garden.\r\nAfter dinner, came many who offered knives and scissors to sell; it being\r\na town famous for these trifles. This Duchy of Bourbon is ordinarily\r\nassigned for the dowry of the Queens of France.\r\n\r\nHence, we took horse for Varennes, an obscure village, where we lay that\r\nnight. The next day, we went somewhat out of the way to see the town of\r\nBourbon l'Archambaut, from whose ancient and rugged castle is derived the\r\nname of the present Royal Family of France. The castle stands on a flinty\r\nrock, overlooking the town. In the midst of the streets are some baths of\r\nmedicinal waters, some of them excessive hot, but nothing so neatly\r\nwalled and adorned as ours in Somersetshire; and indeed they are chiefly\r\nused to drink of, our Queen being then lodged there for that purpose.\r\nAfter dinner, I went to see the St. Chapelle, a prime place of devotion,\r\nwhere is kept one of the thorns of our Savior's crown, and a piece of the\r\nreal cross; excellent paintings on glass, and some few statues of stone\r\nand wood, which they show for curiosities. Hence, we went forward to La\r\nPalise, a village that lodged us that night.\r\n\r\n26th September, 1644. We arrived at Roane, where we quitted our guide,\r\nand took post for Lyons. Roane seemed to me one of the pleasantest and\r\nmost agreeable places imaginable, for a retired person: for, besides the\r\nsituation on the Loire, there are excellent provisions cheap and\r\nabundant. It being late when we left this town, we rode no further than\r\nTarare that night (passing St. Saforin), a little desolate village in a\r\nvalley near a pleasant stream, encompassed with fresh meadows and\r\nvineyards. The hills which we rode over before we descended, and\r\nafterward, on the Lyons side of this place, are high and mountainous; fir\r\nand pines growing frequently on them. The air methought was much altered\r\nas well as the manner of the houses, which are built flatter, more after\r\nthe eastern manner. Before I went to bed, I took a landscape of this\r\npleasant terrace. There followed a most violent tempest of thunder and\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LYONS]\r\n\r\n27th September, 1644. We rode by Pont Charu to Lyons, which being but six\r\nleagues we soon accomplished, having made eighty-five leagues from Tours\r\nin seven days. Here at the Golden Lion, rue de Flandre, I met divers of\r\nmy acquaintance, who, coming from Paris, were designed for Italy. We lost\r\nno time in seeing the city, because of being ready to accompany these\r\ngentlemen in their journey. Lyons is excellently situated on the\r\nconfluence of the rivers Soane and Rhone, which wash the walls of the\r\ncity in a very rapid stream; each of these has its bridge; that over the\r\nRhone consists of twenty-eight arches. The two high cliffs, called St.\r\nJust and St. Sebastian, are very stately; on one of them stands a strong\r\nfort, garrisoned. We visited the cathedral, St. Jean, where was one of\r\nthe fairest clocks for art and busy invention I had ever seen. The fabric\r\nof the church is gothic, as are likewise those of St. Etienne and St.\r\nCroix. From the top of one of the towers of St. Jean (for it has four) we\r\nbeheld the whole city and country, with a prospect reaching to the Alps,\r\nmany leagues distant. The Archbishop's palace is fairly built. The church\r\nof St. Nisier is the greatest; that of the Jacobins is well built. Here\r\nare divers other fine churches and very noble buildings we had not time\r\nto visit, only that of the Charité, or great hospital for poor, infirm\r\npeople, entertaining about 1,500 souls, with a school, granary, gardens,\r\nand all conveniences, maintained at a wonderful expense, worthy seeing.\r\nThe place of the _Belle Cour_ is very spacious, observable for the view\r\nit affords, so various and agreeable, of hills, rocks, vineyards,\r\ngardens, precipices, and other extravagant and incomparable advantages\r\npresenting themselves together. The Pall Mall is set with fair trees. In\r\nfine, this stately, clean, and noble city, built all of stone, abounds\r\nin persons of quality and rich merchants: those of Florence obtaining\r\ngreat privileges above the rest. In the Town-house, they show two tables\r\nof brass, on which is engraven Claudius's speech, pronounced to the\r\nSenate, concerning the franchising of the town, with the Roman\r\nprivileges. There are also other antiquities.\r\n\r\n30th September, 1644. We bargained with a waterman to carry us to Avignon\r\non the river, and got the first night to Vienne, in Dauphiné. This is an\r\nArchbishopric, and the province gives title to the heir-apparent of\r\nFrance. Here we supped and lay, having among other dainties, a dish of\r\ntruffles, which is a certain earth-nut, found out by a hog trained to it,\r\nand for which those animals are sold at a great price. It is in truth an\r\nincomparable meat. We were shown the ruins of an amphitheatre, pretty\r\nentire; and many handsome palaces, especially that of Pontius Pilate, not\r\nfar from the town, at the foot of a solitary mountain, near the river,\r\nhaving four pinnacles. Here it is reported he passed his exile, and\r\nprecipitated himself into the lake not far from it. The house is modern,\r\nand seems to be the seat of some gentleman; being in a very pleasant,\r\nthough melancholy place. The cathedral of Vienne is St. Maurice; and\r\nthere are many other pretty buildings, but nothing more so, than the\r\nmills where they hammer and polish the sword blades.\r\n\r\nHence, the next morning we swam (for the river here is so rapid that the\r\nboat was only steered) to a small village called Thein, where we dined.\r\nOver against this is another town, named Tournon, where is a very strong\r\ncastle under a high precipice. To the castle joins the Jesuits' College,\r\nwho have a fair library. The prospect was so tempting, that I could not\r\nforbear designing it with my crayon.\r\n\r\nWe then came to Valence, a capital city carrying the title of a Duchy;\r\nbut the Bishop is now sole Lord temporal of it, and the country about it.\r\nThe town having a University famous for the study of the civil law, is\r\nmuch frequented; but the churches are none of the fairest, having been\r\ngreatly defaced in the time of the wars. The streets are full of pretty\r\nfountains. The citadel is strong and garrisoned. Here we passed the\r\nnight, and the next morning by Pont St. Esprit, which consists of\r\ntwenty-two arches; in the piers of the arches are windows, as it were, to\r\nreceive the water when it is high and full. Here we went on shore, it\r\nbeing very dangerous to pass the bridge in a boat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AVIGNON]\r\n\r\nHence, leaving our barge, we took horse, seeing at a distance the town\r\nand principality of Orange; and, lodging one night on the way, we arrived\r\nat noon at Avignon. This town has belonged to the Popes ever since the\r\ntime of Clement V.; being, in 1352, alienated by Jane, Queen of Naples\r\nand Sicily. Entering the gates, the soldiers at the guard took our\r\npistols and carbines, and examined us very strictly; after that, having\r\nobtained the Governor's and the Vice-Legate's leave to tarry three days,\r\nwe were civilly conducted to our lodging. The city is on the Rhone, and\r\ndivided from the newer part, or town, which is on the other side of the\r\nriver, by a very fair stone bridge (which has been broken); at one end is\r\na very high rock, on which is a strong castle well furnished with\r\nartillery. The walls of the city are of large, square freestone, the most\r\nneat and best in repair I ever saw. It is full of well-built palaces;\r\nthose of the Vice-Legate and Archbishop being the most magnificent. There\r\nare many sumptuous churches, especially that of St. Magdalene and St.\r\nMartial, wherein the tomb of the Cardinal d'Amboise is the most\r\nobservable. Clement VI. lies buried in that of the Celestines, the altar\r\nwhereof is exceedingly rich: but for nothing I more admired it than the\r\ntomb of Madonna Laura, the celebrated mistress of Petrarch. We saw the\r\nArsenal, the Pope's palace, and the Synagogue of the Jews, who here are\r\ndistinguished by their red hats. Vaucluse, so much renowned for the\r\nsolitude of Petrarch, we beheld from the castle; but could not go to\r\nvisit it for want of time, being now taking mules and a guide for\r\nMarseilles.\r\n\r\nWe lay at Loumas; the next morning, came to Aix, having passed that\r\nextremely rapid and dangerous river of Durance. In this tract, all the\r\nheaths, or commons, are covered with rosemary, lavender, lentiscus, and\r\nthe like sweet shrubs, for many miles together; which to me was very\r\npleasant. Aix is the chief city of Provence, being a Parliament and\r\nPresidential town, with other royal Courts and Metropolitan jurisdiction.\r\nIt is well built, the houses very high, and the streets ample. The\r\nCathedral, St. Savior's, is a noble pile adorned with innumerable\r\nfigures; especially that of St. Michael; the Baptisterie, the Palace, the\r\nCourt, built in a most spacious piazza, are very fair. The Duke of\r\nGuise's house is worth seeing, being furnished with many antiquities in\r\nand about it. The Jesuits have here a royal College, and the City is a\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n7th October, 1644. We had a most delicious journey to Marseilles, through\r\na country sweetly declining to the south and Mediterranean coasts, full\r\nof vineyards and olive-yards, orange trees, myrtles, pomegranates, and\r\nthe like sweet plantations, to which belong pleasantly-situated villas to\r\nthe number of above 1,500, built all of freestone, and in prospect\r\nshowing as if they were so many heaps of snow dropped out of the clouds\r\namong those perennial greens. It was almost at the shutting of the gates\r\nthat we arrived. Marseilles is on the sea-coast, on a pleasant rising\r\nground, well walled, with an excellent port for ships and galleys,\r\nsecured by a huge chain of iron drawn across the harbor at pleasure; and\r\nthere is a well-fortified tower with three other forts, especially that\r\nbuilt on a rock; but the castle commanding the city is that of Notre Dame\r\nde la Garde. In the chapel hung up are divers crocodiles' skins.\r\n\r\nWe went then to visit the galleys, being about twenty-five in number; the\r\nCapitaine of the Galley Royal gave us most courteous entertainment in his\r\ncabin, the slaves in the interim playing both loud and soft music very\r\nrarely. Then he showed us how he commanded their motions with a nod, and\r\nhis whistle making them row out. The spectacle was to me new and strange,\r\nto see so many hundreds of miserably naked persons, their heads being\r\nshaven close, and having only high red bonnets, a pair of coarse canvas\r\ndrawers, their whole backs and legs naked, doubly chained about their\r\nmiddle and legs, in couples, and made fast to their seats, and all\r\ncommanded in a trice by an imperious and cruel seaman. One Turk among the\r\nrest he much favored, who waited on him in his cabin, but with no other\r\ndress than the rest, and a chain locked about his leg, but not coupled.\r\nThis galley was richly carved and gilded, and most of the rest were very\r\nbeautiful. After bestowing something on the slaves, the capitaine sent a\r\nband of them to give us music at dinner where we lodged. I was amazed to\r\ncontemplate how these miserable caitiffs lie in their galley crowded\r\ntogether; yet there was hardly one but had some occupation, by which, as\r\nleisure and calms permitted, they got some little money, insomuch as some\r\nof them have, after many years of cruel servitude, been able to purchase\r\ntheir liberty. The rising-forward and falling-back at their oar, is a\r\nmiserable spectacle, and the noise of their chains, with the roaring of\r\nthe beaten waters, has something of strange and fearful in it to one\r\nunaccustomed to it. They are ruled and chastised by strokes on their\r\nbacks and soles of their feet, on the least disorder, and without the\r\nleast humanity, yet are they cheerful and full of knavery.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, we saw the church of St. Victoire, where is that saint's\r\nhead in a shrine of silver, which weighs 600 pounds. Thence to Notre\r\nDame, exceedingly well built, which is the cathedral. Thence to the Duke\r\nof Guise's Palace, the Palace of Justice, and the Maison du Roi; but\r\nnothing is more strange than the great number of slaves working in the\r\nstreets, and carrying burdens, with their confused noises, and jingling\r\nof their huge chains. The chief trade of the town is in silks and drugs\r\nout of Africa, Syria, and Egypt, and Barbary horses, which are brought\r\nhither in great numbers. The town is governed by four captains, has three\r\nconsuls, and one assessor, three judges royal; the merchants have a judge\r\nfor ordinary causes. Here we bought umbrellas against the heats, and\r\nconsulted of our journey to Cannes by land, for fear of the Picaroon\r\nTurks, who make prize of any small vessels about these parts; we not\r\nfinding a galley bound for Genoa, whither we were designed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PERIGUEUX]\r\n\r\n9th October, 1644. We took mules, passing the first night very late in\r\nsight of St. Baume, and the solitary grot where they affirmed Mary\r\nMagdalen did her penance. The next day, we lay at Perigueux, a city built\r\non an old foundation; witness the ruins of a most stately amphitheatre,\r\nwhich I went out to design, being about a flight-shot from the town; they\r\ncall it now the Rolsies. There is also a strong tower near the town,\r\ncalled the Visone, but the town and city are at some distance from each\r\nother. It is a bishopric; has a cathedral with divers noblemen's houses\r\nin sight of the sea. The place was formerly called Forum Julij, well\r\nknown by antiquaries.\r\n\r\n10th October, 1644. We proceeded by the ruins of a stately aqueduct. The\r\nsoil about the country is rocky, full of pines and rare simples.\r\n\r\n11th October, 1644. We lay at Cannes, which is a small port on the\r\nMediterranean; here we agreed with a seaman to carry us to Genoa, and,\r\nhaving procured a bill of health (without which there is no admission at\r\nany town in Italy), we embarked on the 12th. We touched at the islands of\r\nSt. Margaret and St. Honore, lately retaken from the Spaniards with great\r\nbravery by Prince Harcourt. Here, having paid some small duty, we bought\r\nsome trifles offered us by the soldiers, but without going on shore.\r\nHence, we coasted within two leagues of Antibes, which is the utmost town\r\nin France. Thence by Nice, a city in Savoy, built all of brick, which\r\ngives it a very pleasant appearance toward the sea, having a very high\r\ncastle which commands it. We sailed by Morgus, now called Monaco, having\r\npassed Villa Franca, heretofore Portus Herculis, when, arriving after the\r\ngates were shut, we were forced to abide all night in the barge, which\r\nwas put into the haven, the wind coming contrary. In the morning, we were\r\nhastened away, having no time permitted us by our avaricious master to go\r\nup and see this strong and considerable place, which now belongs to a\r\nprince of the family of Grimaldi, of Genoa, who has put both it and\r\nhimself under the protection of the French. The situation is on a\r\npromontory of solid stone and rock. The town walls very fair. We were\r\ntold that within it was an ample court, and a palace, furnished with the\r\nmost rich and princely movables, and a collection of statues, pictures,\r\nand massy plate to an immense amount.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SAVONA]\r\n\r\nWe sailed by Menton and Ventimiglia, being the first city of the republic\r\nof Genoa; supped at Oneglia, where we anchored and lay on shore. The next\r\nmorning, we coasted in view of the Isle of Corsica, and St. Remo, where\r\nthe shore is furnished with evergreens, oranges, citrons, and date trees;\r\nwe lay at Port Mauritio. The next morning by Diano, Araisso, famous for\r\nthe best coral fishing, growing in abundance on the rocks, deep and\r\ncontinually covered by the sea. By Albenga and Finale, a very fair and\r\nstrong town belonging to the King of Spain, for which reason a monsieur\r\nin our vessel was extremely afraid, as was the patron of our bark, for\r\nthey frequently catch French prizes as they creep by these shores to go\r\ninto Italy; he therefore plied both sails and oars, to get under the\r\nprotection of a Genoese galley that passed not far before us, and in\r\nwhose company we sailed as far as the Cape of Savona, a town built at the\r\nrise of the Apennines: for all this coast (except a little of St. Remo)\r\nis a high and steep mountainous ground, consisting all of rock-marble,\r\nwithout any grass, tree, or rivage, formidable to look on. A strange\r\nobject it is, to consider how some poor cottages stand fast on the\r\ndeclivities of these precipices, and by what steps the inhabitants ascend\r\nto them. The rock consists of all sorts of the most precious marbles.\r\n\r\nHere, on the 15th, forsaking our galley, we encountered a little foul\r\nweather, which made us creep _terra, terra_, as they call it, and so a\r\nvessel that encountered us advised us to do; but our patron, striving to\r\ndouble the point of Savona, making out into the wind put us into great\r\nhazard; for blowing very hard from land between those horrid gaps of the\r\nmountains, it set so violently, as raised on the sudden so great a sea,\r\nthat we could not recover the weather-shore for many hours, insomuch\r\nthat, what with the water already entered, and the confusion of fearful\r\npassengers (of which one was an Irish bishop, and his brother, a priest,\r\nwere confessing some as at the article of death), we were almost\r\nabandoned to despair, our pilot himself giving us up for lost. And now,\r\nas we were weary with pumping and laving out the water, almost sinking,\r\nit pleased God on the sudden to appease the wind, and with much ado and\r\ngreat peril we recovered the shore, which we now kept in view within half\r\na league in sight of those pleasant villas, and within scent of those\r\nfragrant orchards which are on this coast, full of princely retirements\r\nfor the sumptuousness of their buildings, and nobleness of the\r\nplantations, especially those at St. Pietro d'Arena; from whence, the\r\nwind blowing as it did, might perfectly be smelt the peculiar joys of\r\nItaly in the perfumes of orange, citron, and jasmine flowers, for divers\r\nleagues seaward.[19]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: Evelyn seems to have been much enchanted by the\r\n    fragrancy of the air of this coast, for he has noticed it again in\r\n    his dedication of the \"Fumifugium,\" to Charles the Second.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GENOA]\r\n\r\n16th October, 1644. We got to anchor under the Pharos, or watch-tower,\r\nbuilt on a high rock at the mouth of the Mole of Genoa, the weather being\r\nstill so foul that for two hours at least we durst not stand into the\r\nhaven. Toward evening we adventured, and came on shore by the\r\nPrattique-house, where, after strict examination by the Syndics, we were\r\nhad to the Ducal Palace, and there our names being taken, we were\r\nconducted to our inn, kept by one Zacharias, an Englishman. I shall never\r\nforget a story of our host Zachary, who, on the relation of our peril,\r\ntold us another of his own, being shipwrecked, as he affirmed solemnly,\r\nin the middle of a great sea somewhere in the West Indies, that he swam\r\nno less than twenty-two leagues to another island, with a tinderbox\r\nwrapped up in his hair, which was not so much as wet all the way; that\r\npicking up the carpenter's tools with other provisions in a chest, he and\r\nthe carpenter, who accompanied him (good swimmers it seems both), floated\r\nthe chest before them; and, arriving at last in a place full of wood,\r\nthey built another vessel, and so escaped! After this story, we no more\r\ntalked of our danger; Zachary put us quite down.\r\n\r\n17th October, 1644. Accompanied by a most courteous marchand, called\r\nTomson, we went to view the rarities. The city is built in the hollow or\r\nbosom of a mountain, whose ascent is very steep, high, and rocky, so\r\nthat, from the Lantern and Mole to the hill, it represents the shape of a\r\ntheater; the streets and buildings so ranged one above another, as our\r\nseats are in the playhouses; but, from their materials, beauty, and\r\nstructure, never was an artificial scene more beautiful to the eye, nor\r\nis any place, for the size of it, so full of well-designed and stately\r\npalaces, as may be easily concluded by that rare book in a large folio\r\nwhich the great virtuoso and painter, Paul Rubens, has published, though\r\nit contains [the description of] only one street and two or three\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nThe first palace we went to visit was that of Hieronymo del Negros, to\r\nwhich we passed by boat across the harbor. Here I could not but observe\r\nthe sudden and devilish passion of a seaman, who plying us was\r\nintercepted by another fellow, that interposed his boat before him and\r\ntook us in; for the tears gushing out of his eyes, he put his finger in\r\nhis mouth and almost bit it off by the joint, showing it to his\r\nantagonist as an assurance to him of some bloody revenge, if ever he came\r\nnear that part of the harbor again. Indeed this beautiful city is more\r\nstained with such horrid acts of revenge and murders, than any one place\r\nin Europe, or haply in the world, where there is a political government,\r\nwhich makes it unsafe to strangers. It is made a galley matter to carry a\r\nknife whose point is not broken off.\r\n\r\nThis palace of Negros is richly furnished with the rarest pictures; on\r\nthe terrace, or hilly garden, there is a grove of stately trees, among\r\nwhich are sheep, shepherds, and wild beasts, cut very artificially in a\r\ngray stone; fountains, rocks, and fish ponds; casting your eyes one way,\r\nyou would imagine yourself in a wilderness and silent country; sideways,\r\nin the heart of a great city; and backward, in the midst of the sea. All\r\nthis is within one acre of ground. In the house, I noticed those\r\nred-plaster floors which are made so hard, and kept so polished, that for\r\nsome time one would take them for whole pieces of porphyry. I have\r\nfrequently wondered that we never practiced this [art] in England for\r\ncabinets and rooms of state, for it appears to me beyond any invention of\r\nthat kind; but by their carefully covering them with canvass and fine\r\nmattresses, where there is much passage, I suppose they are not lasting\r\nthere in glory, and haply they are often repaired.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous other palaces of particular curiosities, for the\r\nmarchands being very rich, have, like our neighbors, the Hollanders,\r\nlittle or no extent of ground to employ their estates in; as those in\r\npictures and hangings, so these lay it out on marble houses and rich\r\nfurniture. One of the greatest here for circuit is that of the Prince\r\nDoria, which reaches from the sea to the summit of the mountains. The\r\nhouse is most magnificently built without, nor less gloriously furnished\r\nwithin, having whole tables and bedsteads of massy silver, many of them\r\nset with agates, onyxes, cornelians, lazulis, pearls, torquoises, and\r\nother precious stones. The pictures and statues are innumerable. To this\r\npalace belong three gardens, the first whereof is beautified with a\r\nterrace, supported by pillars of marble; there is a fountain of eagles,\r\nand one of Neptune, with other sea-gods, all of the purest white marble;\r\nthey stand in a most ample basin of the same stone. At the side of this\r\ngarden is such an aviary as Sir Francis Bacon describes in his \"_Sermones\r\nFidelium_,\" or \"Essays,\" wherein grow trees of more than two feet\r\ndiameter, besides cypress, myrtles, lentiscuses, and other rare shrubs,\r\nwhich serve to nestle and perch all sorts of birds, who have air and\r\nplace enough under their airy canopy, supported with huge iron work,\r\nstupendous for its fabric and the charge. The other two gardens are full\r\nof orange trees, citrons, and pomegranates, fountains, grots, and\r\nstatues. One of the latter is a colossal Jupiter, under which is the\r\nsepulchre of a beloved dog, for the care of which one of this family\r\nreceived of the King of Spain 500 crowns a year, during the life of that\r\nfaithful animal. The reservoir of water here is a most admirable piece of\r\nart; and so is the grotto over against it.\r\n\r\nWe went hence to the Palace of the Dukes, where is also the Court of\r\nJustice; thence to the Merchant's Walk, rarely covered. Near the Ducal\r\nPalace we saw the public armory, which was almost all new, most neatly\r\nkept and ordered, sufficient for 30,000 men. We were showed many rare\r\ninventions and engines of war peculiar to that armory, as in the state\r\nwhen guns were first put in use. The garrison of the town chiefly\r\nconsists of Germans and Corsicans. The famous Strada Nova, built wholly\r\nof polished marble, was designed by Rubens, and for stateliness of the\r\nbuildings, paving, and evenness of the street, is far superior to any in\r\nEurope, for the number of houses; that of Don Carlo Doria is a most\r\nmagnificent structure. In the gardens of the old Marquis Spinola, I saw\r\nhuge citrons hanging on the trees, applied like our apricots to the\r\nwalls. The churches are no less splendid than the palaces; that of St.\r\nFrancis is wholly built of Parian marble; St. Laurence, in the middle of\r\nthe city, of white and black polished stone, the inside wholly incrusted\r\nwith marble and other precious materials; on the altar of St. John stand\r\nfour sumptuous columns of porphyry; and here we were showed an emerald,\r\nsupposed to be one of the largest in the world. The church of St.\r\nAmbrosio, belonging to the Jesuits, will, when finished, exceed all the\r\nrest; and that of the Annunciada, founded at the charges of one family,\r\nin the present and future design can never be outdone for cost and art.\r\nFrom the churches we walked to the Mole, a work of solid huge stone,\r\nstretching itself near 600 paces into the main sea, and secures the\r\nharbor, heretofore of no safety. Of all the wonders of Italy, for the art\r\nand nature of the design, nothing parallels this. We passed over to the\r\nPharos, or Lantern, a tower of very great height. Here we took horses,\r\nand made the circuit of the city as far as the new walls, built of a\r\nprodigious height, and with Herculean industry; witness those vast pieces\r\nof whole mountains which they have hewn away, and blown up with\r\ngunpowder, to render them steep and inaccessible. They are not much less\r\nthan twenty English miles in extent, reaching beyond the utmost buildings\r\nof the city. From one of these promontories we could easily discern the\r\nisland of Corsica; and from the same, eastward, we saw a vale having a\r\ngreat torrent running through a most desolate barren country; and then\r\nturning our eyes more northward, saw those delicious villas of St. Pietro\r\nd'Arena, which present another Genoa to you, the ravishing retirements of\r\nthe Genoese nobility. Hence, with much pain, we descended toward the\r\nArsenal, where the galleys lie in excellent order.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the city are much affected to the Spanish mode and\r\nstately garb. From the narrowness of the streets, they use sedans and\r\nlitters, and not coaches.\r\n\r\n19th October, 1644. We embarked in a felucca for Livorno, or Leghorn; but\r\nthe sea running very high, we put in at Porto Venere, which we made with\r\nperil, between two narrow horrid rocks, against which the sea dashed with\r\ngreat velocity; but we were soon delivered into as great a calm and a\r\nmost ample harbor, being in the Golfo di Spetia. From hence, we could see\r\nPliny's Delphini Promontorium, now called Capo fino. Here stood that\r\nfamous city of Luna, whence the port was named Lunaris, being about two\r\nleagues over, more resembling a lake than a haven, but defended by\r\ncastles and excessive high mountains. We landed at Lerici, where, being\r\nSunday, was a great procession, carrying the Sacrament about the streets\r\nin solemn devotion. After dinner we took post-horses, passing through\r\nwhole groves of olive trees, the way somewhat rugged and hilly at first,\r\nbut afterward pleasant. Thus we passed through the towns of Sarzana and\r\nMassa, and the vast marble quarries of Carrara, and lodged in an obscure\r\ninn, at a place called Viregio. The next morning we arrived at Pisa,\r\nwhere I met my old friend, Mr. Thomas Henshaw, who was then newly come\r\nout of Spain, and from whose company I never parted till more than a year\r\nafter.\r\n\r\nThe city of Pisa is as much worth seeing as any in Italy; it has\r\ncontended with Rome, Florence, Sardinia, Sicily, and even Carthage. The\r\npalace and church of St. Stefano (where the order of knighthood called by\r\nthat name was instituted) drew first our curiosity, the outside thereof\r\nbeing altogether of polished marble; within, it is full of tables\r\nrelating to this Order; over which hang divers banners and pendants, with\r\nother trophies taken by them from the Turks, against whom they are\r\nparticularly obliged to fight; though a religious order, they are\r\npermitted to marry. At the front of the palace stands a fountain, and the\r\nstatue of the great Duke Cosmo. The Campanile, or Settezonio, built by\r\nJohn Venipont, a German, consists of several orders of pillars, thirty in\r\na row, designed to be much higher. It stands alone on the right side of\r\nthe cathedral, strangely remarkable for this, that the beholder would\r\nexpect it to fall, being built exceedingly declining, by a rare address\r\nof the architect; and how it is supported from falling I think would\r\npuzzle a good geometrician. The Duomo, or Cathedral, standing near it, is\r\na superb structure, beautified with six columns of great antiquity; the\r\ngates are of brass, of admirable workmanship. The cemetery called Campo\r\nSanto is made of divers galley ladings of earth formerly brought from\r\nJerusalem, said to be of such a nature, as to consume dead bodies in\r\nforty hours. 'Tis cloistered with marble arches; and here lies buried the\r\nlearned Philip Decius, who taught in this University. At one side of this\r\nchurch stands an ample and well-wrought marble vessel, which heretofore\r\ncontained the tribute paid yearly by the city to Cæsar. It is placed, as\r\nI remember, on a pillar of opal stone, with divers other antique urns.\r\nNear this, and in the same field, is the Baptistery of San Giovanni,\r\nbuilt of pure white marble, and covered with so artificial a cupola,\r\nthat the voice uttered under it seems to break out of a cloud. The font\r\nand pulpit, supported by four lions, is of inestimable value for the\r\npreciousness of the materials. The place where these buildings stand they\r\ncall the AREA. Hence, we went to the College, to which joins a gallery so\r\nfurnished with natural rarities, stones, minerals, shells, dried animals,\r\nskeletons, etc., as is hardly to be seen in Italy. To this the Physic\r\nGarden lies, where is a noble palm tree, and very fine waterworks. The\r\nriver Arno runs through the middle of this stately city, whence the main\r\nstreet is named Lung 'Arno. It is so ample that the Duke's galleys, built\r\nin the arsenal here, are easily conveyed to Livorno; over the river is an\r\narch, the like of which, for its flatness, and serving for a bridge, is\r\nnowhere in Europe. The Duke has a stately Palace, before which is placed\r\nthe statue of Ferdinand the Third; over against it is the Exchange, built\r\nof marble. Since this city came to be under the Dukes of Tuscany, it has\r\nbeen much depopulated, though there is hardly in Italy any which exceeds\r\nit for stately edifices. The situation of it is low and flat; but the\r\ninhabitants have spacious gardens, and even fields within the walls.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LIVORNO]\r\n\r\n21st October, 1644. We took coach to Livorno, through the Great Duke's\r\nnew park full of huge cork trees, the underwood all myrtles, among which\r\nwere many buffaloes feeding, a kind of wild ox, short nose with horns\r\nreversed; those who work with them command them, as our bearwards do the\r\nbears, with a ring through the nose, and a cord. Much of this park, as\r\nwell as a great part of the country about it, is very fenny, and the air\r\nvery bad.\r\n\r\nLeghorn is the prime port belonging to all the Duke's territories;\r\nheretofore a very obscure town, but since Duke Ferdinand has strongly\r\nfortified it (after the modern way), drained the marshes by cutting a\r\nchannel thence to Pisa navigable sixteen miles, and has raised a Mole,\r\nemulating that at Genoa, to secure the shipping, it is become a place of\r\ngreat receipt; it has also a place for the galleys, where they lie safe.\r\nBefore the sea is an ample piazza for the market, where are the statues\r\nin copper of the four slaves, much exceeding the life for proportion,\r\nand, in the judgment of most artists, one of the best pieces of modern\r\nwork. Here, especially in this piazza, is such a concourse of slaves,\r\nTurks, Moors, and other nations, that the number and confusion is\r\nprodigious; some buying, others selling, others drinking, others playing,\r\nsome working, others sleeping, fighting, singing, weeping, all nearly\r\nnaked, and miserably chained. Here was a tent, where any idle fellow\r\nmight stake his liberty against a few crowns, at dice, or other hazard;\r\nand, if he lost, he was immediately chained and led away to the galleys,\r\nwhere he was to serve a term of years, but from whence they seldom\r\nreturned; many sottish persons, in a drunken bravado, would try their\r\nfortune in this way.\r\n\r\nThe houses of this neat town are very uniform, and excellently painted _á\r\nfresco_ on the outer walls, with representations of many of their\r\nvictories over the Turks. The houses, though low on account of the\r\nearthquakes which frequently happen here, (as did one during my being in\r\nItaly), are very well built; the piazza is very fair and commodious, and,\r\nwith the church, whose four columns at the portico are of black marble\r\npolished, gave the first hint to the building both of the church and\r\npiazza in Covent Garden with us, though very imperfectly pursued.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FLORENCE]\r\n\r\n22d October, 1644. From Livorno, I took coach to Empoly, where we lay,\r\nand the next day arrived at Florence, being recommended to the house of\r\nSignor Baritiére, in the Piazza del Spirito Santo, where we were\r\nexceedingly well treated. Florence is at the foot of the Apennines, the\r\nwest part full of stately groves and pleasant meadows, beautified with\r\nmore than a thousand houses and country palaces of note, belonging to\r\ngentlemen of the town. The river Arno runs through the city, in a broad,\r\nbut very shallow channel, dividing it, as it were, in the middle, and\r\nover it are four most sumptuous bridges of stone. On that nearest to our\r\nquarter are the four Seasons, in white marble; on another are the\r\ngoldsmiths' shops; at the head of the former stands a column of ophite,\r\nupon which a statue of Justice, with her balance and sword, cut out of\r\nporphyry, and the more remarkable for being the first which had been\r\ncarved out of that hard material, and brought to perfection, after the\r\nart had been utterly lost; they say this was done by hardening the tools\r\nin the juice of certain herbs. This statue was erected in that corner,\r\nbecause there Cosmo was first saluted with the news of Sienna being\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nNear this is the famous Palazzo di Strozzi, a princely piece of\r\narchitecture, in a rustic manner. The Palace of Pitti was built by that\r\nfamily, but of late greatly beautified by Cosmo with huge square stones\r\nof the Doric, Ionic, and the Corinthian orders, with a terrace at each\r\nside having rustic uncut balustrades, with a fountain that ends in a\r\ncascade seen from the great gate, and so forming a vista to the gardens.\r\nNothing is more admirable than the vacant staircase, marbles, statues,\r\nurns, pictures, court, grotto, and waterworks. In the quadrangle is a\r\nhuge jetto of water in a volto of four faces, with noble statues at each\r\nsquare, especially the Diana of porphyry above the grotto. We were here\r\nshown a prodigious great loadstone.\r\n\r\nThe garden has every variety, hills, dales, rocks, groves, aviaries,\r\nvivaries, fountains, especially one of five jettos, the middle basin\r\nbeing one of the longest stones I ever saw. Here is everything to make\r\nsuch a Paradise delightful. In the garden I saw a rose grafted on an\r\norange tree. There was much topiary-work, and columns in architecture\r\nabout the hedges. The Duke has added an ample laboratory, over against\r\nwhich stands a fort on a hill, where they told us his treasure is kept.\r\nIn this Palace the Duke ordinarily resides, living with his Swiss guards,\r\nafter the frugal Italian way, and even selling what he can spare of his\r\nwines, at the cellar under his very house, wicker bottles dangling over\r\neven the chief entrance into the palace, serving for a vintner's bush.\r\n\r\nIn the Church of Santo Spirito the altar and reliquary are most rich, and\r\nfull of precious stones; there are four pillars of a kind of serpentine,\r\nand some of blue. Hence we went to another Palace of the Duke's, called\r\nPalazzo Vecchio, before which is a statue of David, by Michael Angelo,\r\nand one of Hercules, killing Cacus, the work of Baccio Bandinelli. The\r\nquadrangle about this is of the Corinthian order, and in the hall are\r\nmany rare marbles, as those of Leo X. and Clement VII., both Popes of the\r\nMedicean family; also the acts of Cosmo, in rare painting. In the chapel\r\nis kept (as they would make one believe) the original Gospel of St. John,\r\nwritten with his own hand; and the famous Florentine Pandects, and\r\ndivers precious stones. Near it is another pendent Tower like that of\r\nPisa, always threatening ruin.\r\n\r\nUnder the Court of Justice is a stately arcade for men to walk in, and\r\nover that, the shops of divers rare artists who continually work for the\r\ngreat Duke. Above this is that renowned Ceimeliarcha, or repository,\r\nwherein are hundreds of admirable antiquities, statues of marble and\r\nmetal, vases of porphyry, etc.; but among the statues none so famous as\r\nthe Scipio, the Boar, the Idol of Apollo, brought from the Delphic\r\nTemple, and two triumphant columns. Over these hang the pictures of the\r\nmost famous persons and illustrious men in arts or arms, to the number of\r\n300, taken out of the museum of Paulus Jovius. They then led us into a\r\nlarge square room, in the middle of which stood a cabinet of an\r\noctangular form, so adorned and furnished with crystals, agates, and\r\nsculptures, as exceeds any description. This cabinet is called the\r\n_Tribuna_ and in it is a pearl as big as an hazelnut. The cabinet is of\r\nebony, lazuli, and jasper; over the door is a round of M. Angelo; on the\r\ncabinet, Leo X. with other paintings of Raphael, del Sarto, Perugino, and\r\nCorreggio, viz, a St. John, a Virgin, a Boy, two Apostles, two heads of\r\nDurer, rarely carved. Over this cabinet is a globe of ivory, excellently\r\ncarved; the Labors of Hercules, in massy silver, and many incomparable\r\npictures in small. There is another, which had about it eight Oriental\r\ncolumns of alabaster, on each whereof was placed a head of a Cæsar,\r\ncovered with a canopy so richly set with precious stones, that they\r\nresembled a firmament of stars. Within it was our Savior's Passion, and\r\nthe twelve Apostles in amber. This cabinet was valued at two hundred\r\nthousand crowns. In another, with calcedon pillars, was a series of\r\ngolden medals. Here is also another rich ebony cabinet cupolaed with a\r\ntortoise shell, and containing a collection of gold medals esteemed worth\r\n50,000 crowns; a wreathed pillar of Oriental alabaster, divers paintings\r\nof Da Vinci, Pontorno, del Sarto, an _Ecce Homo_ of Titian, a Boy of\r\nBronzini, etc. They showed us a branch of coral fixed on the rock, which\r\nthey affirm does still grow. In another room, is kept the Tabernacle\r\nappointed for the chapel of St. Laurence, about which are placed small\r\nstatues of Saints, of precious material; a piece of such art and cost,\r\nthat having been these forty years in perfecting, it is one of the most\r\ncurious things in the world. Here were divers tables of Pietra Commesso,\r\nwhich is a marble ground inlaid with several sorts of marbles and stones\r\nof various colors representing flowers, trees, beasts, birds, and\r\nlandscapes. In one is represented the town of Leghorn, by the same hand\r\nwho inlaid the altar of St. Laurence, Domenico Benotti, of whom I\r\npurchased nineteen pieces of the same work for a cabinet. In a press near\r\nthis they showed an iron nail, one half whereof being converted into gold\r\nby one Thurnheuser, a German chemist, is looked on as a great rarity; but\r\nit plainly appeared to have been soldered together. There is a curious\r\nwatch, a monstrous turquoise as big as an egg, on which is carved an\r\nemperor's head.\r\n\r\nIn the armory are kept many antique habits, as those of Chinese kings;\r\nthe sword of Charlemagne; Hannibal's headpiece; a loadstone of a yard\r\nlong, which bears up 86 lbs. weight, in a chain of seventeen links, such\r\nas the slaves are tied to. In another room are such rare turneries in\r\nivory, as are not to be described for their curiosity. There is a fair\r\npillar of oriental alabaster; twelve vast and complete services of silver\r\nplate, and one of gold, all of excellent workmanship; a rich embroidered\r\nsaddle of pearls sent by the Emperor to this Duke; and here is that\r\nembroidered chair set with precious stones in which he sits, when, on St.\r\nJohn's day, he receives the tribute of the cities.\r\n\r\n25th October, 1644. We went to the Portico where the famous statue of\r\nJudith and Holofernes stands, also the Medusa, all of copper; but what is\r\nmost admirable is the Rape of a Sabine, with another man under foot, the\r\nconfusion and turning of whose limbs is most admirable. It is of one\r\nentire marble, the work of John di Bologna, and is most stupendous; this\r\nstands directly against the great piazza, where, to adorn one fountain,\r\nare erected four marble statues and eight of brass, representing Neptune\r\nand his family of sea gods, of a Colossean magnitude, with four sea\r\nhorses, in Parian marble of Lamedrati, in the midst of a very great\r\nbasin: a work, I think, hardly to be paralleled. Here is also the famous\r\nstatue of David, by M. Angelo; Hercules and Cacus, by Baccio Bandinelli;\r\nthe Perseus, in copper, by Benevento, and the Judith of Donatelli, which\r\nstand publicly before the old Palace with the Centaur of Bologna, huge\r\nColossean figures. Near this stand Cosmo di Medicis on horseback, in\r\nbrass on a pedestal of marble, and four copper bassorelievos by John di\r\nBologna, with divers inscriptions; the Ferdinand the First, on horseback,\r\nis of Pietro Tacca. The brazen boar, which serves for another public\r\nfountain, is admirable.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, we went to the Church of the Annunciata, where the Duke and\r\nhis Court were at their devotions, being a place of extraordinary repute\r\nfor sanctity: for here is a shrine that does great miracles, [proved] by\r\ninnumerable votive tablets, etc., covering almost the walls of the whole\r\nchurch. This is the image of Gabriel, who saluted the Blessed Virgin, and\r\nwhich the artist finished so well, that he was in despair of performing\r\nthe Virgin's face so well; whereupon it was miraculously done for him\r\nwhile he slept; but others say it was painted by St. Luke himself.\r\nWhoever it was, infinite is the devotion of both sexes to it. The altar\r\nis set off with four columns of oriental alabaster, and lighted by thirty\r\ngreat silver lamps. There are innumerable other pictures by rare masters.\r\nOur Savior's Passion in brass tables inserted in marble, is the work of\r\nJohn di Bologna and Baccio Bandinelli.\r\n\r\nTo this church joins a convent, whose cloister is painted in _fresco_\r\nvery rarely. There is also near it an hospital for 1,000 persons, with\r\nnurse-children, and several other charitable accommodations.\r\n\r\nAt the Duke's Cavalerizza, the Prince has a stable of the finest horses\r\nof all countries, Arabs, Turks, Barbs, Gennets, English, etc., which are\r\ncontinually exercised in the _manège_.\r\n\r\nNear this is a place where are kept several wild beasts, as wolves, cats,\r\nbears, tigers, and lions. They are loose in a deep walled court, and\r\ntherefore to be seen with more pleasure than those at the Tower of\r\nLondon, in their grates. One of the lions leaped to a surprising height,\r\nto catch a joint of mutton which I caused to be hung down.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIENNA]\r\n\r\n[20]There are many plain brick towers erected for defense, when this was\r\na free state. The highest is called the Mangio, standing at the foot of\r\nthe piazza which we went first to see after our arrival. At the entrance\r\nof this tower is a chapel open toward the piazza, of marble well adorned\r\nwith sculpture.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: There seems to be here an omission in the MS. between\r\n    their leaving Florence and going to Sienna.]\r\n\r\nOn the other side is the Signoria, or Court of Justice, well built _a la\r\nmoderna_, of brick; indeed the bricks of Sienna are so well made, that\r\nthey look almost as well as porphyry itself, having a kind of natural\r\npolish.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate-house is a very fair Hall where they sometimes entertain\r\nthe people with public shows and operas, as they call them. Toward the\r\nleft are the statues of Romulus and Remus with the wolf, all of brass,\r\nplaced on a column of ophite stone, which they report was brought from\r\nthe renowned Ephesian Temple. These ensigns being the arms of the town,\r\nare set up in divers of the streets and public ways both within and far\r\nwithout the city.\r\n\r\nThe piazza compasses the facciáta of the court and chapel, and, being\r\nmade with descending steps, much resembles the figure of an escalop\r\nshell. The white ranges of pavement, intermixed with the excellent bricks\r\nabove mentioned, with which the town is generally well paved, render it\r\nvery clean. About this market place (for so it is) are many fair palaces,\r\nthough not built with excess of elegance. There stands an arch, the work\r\nof Baltazzar di Sienna, built with wonderful ingenuity, so that it is not\r\neasy to conceive how it is supported, yet it has some imperceptible\r\ncontiguations, which do not betray themselves easily to the eye. On the\r\nedge of the piazza is a goodly fountain beautified with statues, the\r\nwater issuing out of the wolves' mouths, being the work of Jacobo\r\nQuercei, a famous artist. There are divers other public fountains in the\r\ncity, of good design.\r\n\r\nAfter this we walked to the Sapienza, which is the University, or rather\r\nCollege, where the high Germans enjoy many particular privileges when\r\nthey addict themselves to the civil law: and indeed this place has\r\nproduced many excellent scholars, besides those three Popes, Alexander,\r\nPius II., and III., of that name, the learned Æneas Sylvius; and both\r\nwere of the ancient house of the Piccolomini.\r\n\r\nThe chief street is called Strada Romana, in which Pius II. has built a\r\nmost stately palace of square stone, with an incomparable portico\r\njoining near to it. The town is commanded by a castle which hath four\r\nbastions and a garrison of soldiers. Near it is a list to ride horses in,\r\nmuch frequented by the gallants in summer.\r\n\r\nNot far from hence is the Church and Convent of the Dominicans, where in\r\nthe chapel of St. Catherine of Sienna they show her head, the rest of her\r\nbody being translated to Rome. The Duomo, or Cathedral, both without and\r\nwithin, is of large square stones of black and white marble polished, of\r\ninexpressible beauty, as is the front adorned with sculpture and rare\r\nstatues. In the middle is a stately cupola and two columns of sundry\r\nstreaked colored marble. About the body of the church, on a cornice\r\nwithin, are inserted the heads of all the Popes. The pulpit is beautified\r\nwith marble figures, a piece of exquisite work; but what exceeds all\r\ndescription is the pavement, where (besides the various emblems and other\r\nfigures in the nave) the choir is wrought with the history of the Bible,\r\nso artificially expressed in the natural colors of the marbles, that few\r\npictures exceed it. Here stands a Christo, rarely cut in marble, and on\r\nthe large high altar is a brazen vessel of admirable invention and art.\r\nThe organs are exceeding sweet and well tuned. On the left side of the\r\naltar is the library, where are painted the acts of Æneas Sylvius, and\r\nothers by Raphael. They showed us an arm of St. John the Baptist,\r\nwherewith, they say, he baptized our Savior in Jordan; it was given by\r\nthe King of Peloponnesus to one of the Popes, as an inscription\r\ntestifies. They have also St. Peter's sword, with which he smote off the\r\near of Malchus.\r\n\r\nJust against the cathedral, we went into the Hospital, where they\r\nentertain and refresh for three or four days, gratis, such pilgrims as go\r\nto Rome. In the chapel belonging to it lies the body of St. Susorius,\r\ntheir founder, as yet uncorrupted, though dead many hundreds of years.\r\nThey show one of the nails which pierced our Savior, and Saint\r\nChrysostom's \"Comment on the Gospel,\" written by his own hand. Below the\r\nhill stands the pool called Fonte Brande, where fish are fed for pleasure\r\nmore than food.\r\n\r\nSt. Francis's Church is a large pile, near which, yet a little without\r\nthe city, grows a tree which they report in their legend grew from the\r\nSaint's staff, which, on going to sleep, he fixed in the ground, and at\r\nhis waking found it had grown a large tree. They affirm that the wood of\r\nit in decoction cures sundry diseases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TORRINIERI]\r\n\r\n2d November, 1644. We went from Sienna, desirous of being present at the\r\ncavalcade of the new Pope, Innocent X.,[21] who had not yet made the\r\ngrand procession to St. John di Laterano. We set out by Porto Romano, the\r\ncountry all about the town being rare for hunting and game. Wild boar and\r\nvenison are frequently sold in the shops in many of the towns about it.\r\nWe passed near Monte Oliveto, where the monastery of that Order is\r\npleasantly situated, and worth seeing. Passing over a bridge, which, by\r\nthe inscription, appears to have been built by Prince Matthias, we went\r\nthrough Buon-Convento, famous for the death of the Emperor, Henry VII.,\r\nwho was here poisoned with the Holy Eucharist. Thence, we came to\r\nTorrinieri, where we dined. This village is in a sweet valley, in view of\r\nMontalcino, famous for the rare Muscatello.[22] After three miles more,\r\nwe go by St. Quirico, and lay at a private osteria near it, where, after\r\nwe were provided of lodging, came in Cardinal Donghi, a Genoese by birth,\r\nnow come from Rome; he was so civil as to entertain us with great\r\nrespect, hearing we were English, for that, he told us he had been once\r\nin our country. Among other discourse, he related how a dove had been\r\nseen to sit on the chair in the Conclave at the election of Pope\r\nInnocent, which he magnified as a great good omen, with other particulars\r\nwhich we inquired of him, till our suppers parted us. He came in great\r\nstate with his own bedstead and all the furniture, yet would by no means\r\nsuffer us to resign the room we had taken up in the lodging before his\r\narrival. Next morning, we rode by Monte Pientio, or, as vulgarly called,\r\nMonte Mantumiato, which is of an excessive height, ever and anon peeping\r\nabove any clouds with its snowy head, till we had climbed to the inn at\r\nRadicofani, built by Ferdinand, the great Duke, for the necessary\r\nrefreshment of travelers in so inhospitable a place. As we ascended, we\r\nentered a very thick, solid, and dark body of clouds, looking like rocks\r\nat a little distance, which lasted near a mile in going up; they were dry\r\nmisty vapors, hanging undissolved for a vast thickness, and obscuring\r\nboth the sun and earth, so that we seemed to be in the sea rather than in\r\nthe clouds, till, having pierced through it, we came into a most serene\r\nheaven, as if we had been above all human conversation, the mountain\r\nappearing more like a great island than joined to any other hills; for we\r\ncould perceive nothing but a sea of thick clouds rolling under our feet\r\nlike huge waves, every now and then suffering the top of some other\r\nmountain to peep through, which we could discover many miles off: and\r\nbetween some breaches of the clouds we could see landscapes and villages\r\nof the subjacent country. This was one of the most pleasant, new, and\r\naltogether surprising objects that I had ever beheld.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: John Baptista Pamphili, chosen Pope in October, 1644,\r\n    died in 1655.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: The wine so called.]\r\n\r\nOn the summit of this horrid rock (for so it is) is built a very strong\r\nfort, garrisoned, and somewhat beneath it is a small town; the provisions\r\nare drawn up with ropes and engines, the precipice being otherwise\r\ninaccessible. At one end of the town lie heaps of rocks so strangely\r\nbroken off from the ragged mountain, as would affright one with their\r\nhorror and menacing postures. Just opposite to the inn gushed out a\r\nplentiful and most useful fountain which falls into a great trough of\r\nstone, bearing the Duke of Tuscany's arms. Here we dined, and I with my\r\nblack lead pen took the prospect. It is one of the utmost confines of the\r\nEtrurian State toward St. Peter's Patrimony, since the gift of Matilda to\r\nGregory VII., as is pretended.\r\n\r\nHere we pass a stone bridge, built by Pope Gregory XIV., and thence\r\nimmediately to Acquapendente, a town situated on a very ragged rock, down\r\nwhich precipitates an entire river (which gives it the denomination),\r\nwith a most horrid roaring noise. We lay at the posthouse, on which is\r\nthis inscription:\r\n\r\n    \"_L'Insegna della Posta, é posta a posta,\r\n    In questa posta, fin che habbia à sua posta\r\n    Ogn'un Cavallo a Vetturi in Posta._\"\r\n\r\nBefore it was dark, we went to see the Monastery of the Franciscans,\r\nfamous for six learned Popes, and sundry other great scholars, especially\r\nthe renowned physician and anatomist, Fabricius de Acquapendente, who was\r\nbred and born there.\r\n\r\n4th November, 1644. After a little riding, we descended toward the Lake\r\nof Bolsena, which being above twenty miles in circuit, yields from hence\r\na most incomparable prospect. Near the middle of it are two small\r\nislands, in one of which is a convent of melancholy Capuchins, where\r\nthose of the Farnesian family are interred. Pliny calls it _Tarquiniensis\r\nLacus_, and talks of divers floating islands about it, but they did not\r\nappear to us. The lake is environed with mountains, at one of whose sides\r\nwe passed toward the town Bolsena, anciently Volsinium, famous in those\r\ntimes, as is testified by divers rare sculptures in the court of St.\r\nChristiana's church, the urn, altar, and jasper columns.\r\n\r\nAfter seven miles' riding, passing through a wood heretofore sacred to\r\nJuno, we came to Montefiascone, the head of the Falisci, a famous people\r\nin old time, and heretofore Falernum, as renowned for its excellent wine,\r\nas now for the story of the Dutch Bishop, who lies buried in St.\r\nFlavian's church with this epitaph:\r\n\r\n    \"_Propter Est, Est, dominus meus mortuus est._\"\r\n\r\nBecause, having ordered his servant to ride before, and inquire where the\r\nbest wine was, and there write _Est_, the man found some so good that he\r\nwrote _Est, Est_, upon the vessels, and the Bishop drinking too much of\r\nit, died.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VITERBO]\r\n\r\nFrom Montefiascone, we travel a plain and pleasant champaign to Viterbo,\r\nwhich presents itself with much state afar off, in regard of her many\r\nlofty pinnacles and towers; neither does it deceive our expectation; for\r\nit is exceedingly beautified with public fountains, especially that at\r\nthe entrance, which is all of brass and adorned with many rare figures,\r\nand salutes the passenger with a most agreeable object and refreshing\r\nwaters. There are many Popes buried in this city, and in the palace is\r\nthis odd inscription:\r\n\r\n    \"_Osiridis victoriam in Gigantas litteris historiographicis in hoc\r\n    antiquissimo marmore inscriptam, ex Herculis olim, nunc Divi\r\n    Laurentij Templo translatam, ad conversanda: vetustiss: patriæ\r\n    monumenta atq' decora his locandum statuit S.P.Q.V._\"\r\n\r\nUnder it:\r\n\r\n    \"_Sum Osiris Rex Jupiter universo in terrarum orbe._\"\r\n\r\n    \"_Sum Osiris Rex qui ab Itala in Gigantes exercitus veni, vidi, et\r\n    vici._\"\r\n\r\n    \"_Sum Osiris Rex qui terrarum pacata Italiam decem a'nos quorum\r\n    inventor fui._\"\r\n\r\nNear the town is a sulphurous fountain, which continually boils. After\r\ndinner we took horse by the new way of Capranica, and so passing near\r\nMount Ciminus and the Lake, we began to enter the plains of Rome; at\r\nwhich sight my thoughts were strangely elevated, but soon allayed by so\r\nviolent a shower, which fell just as we were contemplating that proud\r\nMistress of the world, and descending by the Vatican (for at that gate we\r\nentered), that before we got into the city I was wet to the skin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROME]\r\n\r\nI came to Rome on the 4th of November, 1644, about five at night; and\r\nbeing perplexed for a convenient lodging, wandered up and down on\r\nhorseback, till at last one conducted us to Monsieur Petit's, a\r\nFrenchman, near the Piazza Spagnola. Here I alighted, and, having\r\nbargained with my host for twenty crowns a month, I caused a good fire to\r\nbe made in my chamber and went to bed, being so very wet. The next\r\nmorning (for I was resolved to spend no time idly here) I got acquainted\r\nwith several persons who had long lived at Rome. I was especially\r\nrecommended to Father John, a Benedictine monk and Superior of his Order\r\nfor the English College of Douay, a person of singular learning,\r\nreligion, and humanity; also to Mr. Patrick Cary, an Abbot, brother to\r\nour learned Lord Falkland, a witty young priest, who afterward came over\r\nto our church; Dr. Bacon and Dr. Gibbs, physicians who had dependence on\r\nCardinal Caponi, the latter being an excellent poet; Father Courtney, the\r\nchief of the Jesuits in the English College; my Lord of Somerset, brother\r\nto the Marquis of Worcester; and some others, from whom I received\r\ninstructions how to behave in town, with directions to masters and books\r\nto take in search of the antiquities, churches, collections, etc.\r\nAccordingly, the next day, November 6th, I began to be very\r\npragmatical.[23]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: The sense in which Evelyn uses this word is that of\r\n    its old signification, as being very active and full of business,\r\n    setting to work systematically with what he came upon, namely, to\r\n    view the antiquities and beauties of Rome.]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, our sights-man (for so they name certain persons here\r\nwho get their living by leading strangers about to see the city) went to\r\nthe Palace Farnese, a magnificent square structure, built by Michael\r\nAngelo, of the three orders of columns after the ancient manner, and when\r\narchitecture was but newly recovered from the Gothic barbarity. The court\r\nis square and terraced, having two pairs of stairs which lead to the\r\nupper rooms, and conducted us to that famous gallery painted by Augustine\r\nCaracci, than which nothing is more rare of that art; so deep and\r\nwell-studied are all the figures, that it would require more judgment\r\nthan I confess I had, to determine whether they were flat, or embossed.\r\nThence, we passed into another, painted in chiaroscúro, representing the\r\nfabulous history of Hercules. We went out on a terrace, where was a\r\npretty garden on the leads, for it is built in a place that has no extent\r\nof ground backward. The great hall is wrought by Salviati and Zuccharo,\r\nfurnished with statues, one of which being modern is the figure of a\r\nFarnese, in a triumphant posture, of white marble, worthy of admiration.\r\nHere we were shown the Museum of Fulvius Ursinos, replete with\r\ninnumerable collections; but the Major-Domo being absent, we could not at\r\nthis time see all we wished. Descending into the court, we with\r\nastonishment contemplated those two incomparable statues of Hercules and\r\nFlora, so much celebrated by Pliny, and indeed by all antiquity, as two\r\nof the most rare pieces in the world; there likewise stands a modern\r\nstatue of Hercules and two Gladiators, not to be despised. In a second\r\ncourt was a temporary shelter of boards over the most stupendous and\r\nnever-to-be-sufficiently-admired Torso of Amphion and Dirce, represented\r\nin five figures, exceeding the life in magnitude, of the purest white\r\nmarble, the contending work of those famous statuaries, Apollonius and\r\nTaurisco, in the time of Augustus, hewed out of one entire stone, and\r\nremaining unblemished, to be valued beyond all the marbles of the world\r\nfor its antiquity and workmanship. There are divers other heads and\r\nbusts. At the entrance of this stately palace stand two rare and vast\r\nfountains of garnito stone, brought into this piazza out of Titus's\r\nBaths. Here, in summer, the gentlemen of Rome take the FRESCO in their\r\ncoaches and on foot. At the sides of this court, we visited the palace\r\nof Signor Pichini, who has a good collection of antiquities, especially\r\nthe Adonis of Parian marble, which my Lord Arundel would once have\r\npurchased, if a great price would have been taken for it.\r\n\r\nWe went into the CAMPO VACCINO, by the ruins of the Temple of Peace,\r\nbuilt by Titus Vespasianus, and thought to be the largest as well as the\r\nmost richly furnished of all the Roman dedicated places: it is now a heap\r\nrather than a temple, yet the roof and _volto_ continue firm, showing it\r\nto have been formerly of incomparable workmanship. This goodly structure\r\nwas, none knows how, consumed by fire the very night, by all computation,\r\nthat our blessed Savior was born.\r\n\r\nFrom hence we passed by the place into which Curtius precipitated himself\r\nfor the love of his country, now without any sign of a lake, or vorago.\r\nNear this stand some columns of white marble, of exquisite work, supposed\r\nto be part of the Temple of Jupiter Tonans, built by Augustus; the work\r\nof the capitals (being Corinthian) and architrave is excellent, full of\r\nsacrificing utensils. There are three other of Jupiter Stator. Opposite\r\nto these are the oratories, or churches, of St. Cosmo and Damiano,\r\nheretofore the Temples of Romulus; a pretty old fabric, with a tribunal,\r\nor tholus within, wrought all of Mosaic. The gates before it are brass,\r\nand the whole much obliged to Pope Urban VIII. In this sacred place lie\r\nthe bodies of those two martyrs; and in a chapel on the right hand is a\r\nrare painting of Cavaliere Baglioni.\r\n\r\nWe next entered St. Lorenzo in Miranda. The portico is supported by a\r\nrange of most stately columns; the inscription cut in the architrave\r\nshows it to have been the Temple of Faustina. It is now made a fair\r\nchurch, and has an hospital which joins it. On the same side is St.\r\nAdriano, heretofore dedicated to Saturn. Before this was once placed a\r\nmilitary column, supposed to be set in the center of the city, from\r\nwhence they used to compute the distance of all the cities and places of\r\nnote under the dominion of those universal monarchs. To this church are\r\nlikewise brazen gates and a noble front; just opposite we saw the heaps\r\nand ruins of Cicero's palace. Hence we went toward Mons Capitolinus, at\r\nthe foot of which stands the arch of Septimus Severus, full and entire,\r\nsave where the pedestal and some of the lower members are choked up with\r\nruins and earth. This arch is exceedingly enriched with sculpture and\r\ntrophies, with a large inscription. In the terrestrial and naval battles\r\nhere graven, is seen the Roman Aries (the battering-ram); and this was\r\nthe first triumphal arch set up in Rome. The Capitol, to which we climbed\r\nby very broad steps, is built about a square court, at the right hand of\r\nwhich, going up from Campo Vaccino, gushes a plentiful stream from the\r\nstatue of Tiber, in porphyry, very antique, and another representing\r\nRome; but, above all, is the admirable figure of Marforius, casting water\r\ninto a most ample concha. The front of this court is crowned with an\r\nexcellent fabric containing the Courts of Justice, and where the Criminal\r\nNotary sits, and others. In one of the halls they show the statues of\r\nGregory XIII. and Paul III., with several others. To this joins a\r\nhandsome tower, the whole faciata adorned with noble statues, both on the\r\noutside and on the battlements, ascended by a double pair of stairs, and\r\na stately Posario.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the court stands that incomparable horse bearing the\r\nEmperor Marcus Aurelius, as big as the life, of Corinthian metal, placed\r\non a pedestal of marble, esteemed one of the noblest pieces of work now\r\nextant, antique and very rare. There is also a vast head of a colossean\r\nmagnitude, of white marble, fixed in the wall. At the descending stairs\r\nare set two horses of white marble governed by two naked slaves, taken to\r\nbe Castor and Pollux, brought from Pompey's Theatre. On the balustrade,\r\nthe trophies of Marius against the Cimbrians, very ancient and\r\ninstructive. At the foot of the steps toward the left hand is that\r\nColonna Miliaria, with the globe of brass on it, mentioned to have been\r\nformerly set in Campo Vaccino. On the same hand, is the palace of the\r\nSigniori Conservatori, or three Consuls, now the civil governors of the\r\ncity, containing the fraternities, or halls and guilds (as we call them),\r\nof sundry companies, and other offices of state. Under the portico\r\nwithin, are the statues of Augustus Cæsar, a Bacchus, and the so renowned\r\nColonna Rostrata of Duillius, with the excellent bassi-relievi. In a\r\nsmaller court, the statue of Constantine, on a fountain, a Minerva's head\r\nof brass, and that of Commodus, to which belongs a hand, the thumb\r\nwhereof is at least an ell long, and yet proportionable; but the rest of\r\nthe _colosse_ is lost. In the corner of this court stand a horse and lion\r\nfighting, as big as life, in white marble, exceedingly valued; likewise\r\nthe Rape of the Sabines; two cumbent figures of Alexander and Mammea; two\r\nmonstrous feet of a _colosse_ of Apollo; the Sepulchre of Agrippina; and\r\nthe standard, or antique measure of the Roman foot. Ascending by the\r\nsteps of the other corner, are inserted four basso-relievos, viz, the\r\ntriumph and sacrifice of Marcus Aurelius, which last, for the antiquity\r\nand rareness of the work, I caused my painter, Carlo Neapolitano, to\r\ncopy. There are also two statues of the Muses, and one of Adrian, the\r\nEmperor; above stands the figure of Marius, and by the wall Marsyas bound\r\nto a tree; all of them excellent and antique. Above in the lobby are\r\ninserted into the walls those ancient laws, on brass, called the Twelve\r\nTables; a fair Madonna of Pietro Perugino, painted on the wall; near\r\nwhich are the archives, full of ancient records.\r\n\r\nIn the great hall are divers excellent paintings of Cavaliero Giuseppe\r\nd'Arpino, a statue in brass of Sextus V. and of Leo X., of marble. In\r\nanother hall are many modern statues of their late Consuls and Governors,\r\nset about with fine antique heads; others are painted by excellent\r\nmasters, representing the actions of M. Scævola, Horatius Cocles, etc.\r\nThe room where the Conservatori now feast upon solemn days, is tapestried\r\nwith crimson damask, embroidered with gold, having a state or\r\n_balduquino_ of crimson velvet, very rich; the frieze above rarely\r\npainted. Here are in brass, Romulus and Remus sucking the wolf, of brass,\r\nwith the Shepherd, Faustulus, by them; also the boy plucking the thorn\r\nout of his foot, of brass, so much admired by artists. There are also\r\nholy statues and heads of Saints. In a gallery near adjoining are the\r\nnames of the ancient Consuls, Prætors, and Fasti Romani, so celebrated by\r\nthe learned; also the figure of an old woman; two others representing\r\nPoverty; and more in fragments. In another large room, furnished with\r\nvelvet, are the statue of Adonis, very rare, and divers antique heads. In\r\nthe next chamber, is an old statue of Cicero, one of another Consul, a\r\nHercules in brass, two women's heads of incomparable work, six other\r\nstatues; and, over the chimney, a very rare basso-relievo, and other\r\nfigures. In a little lobby before the chapel, is the statue of Hannibal,\r\na Bacchus very antique, _bustoes_ of Pan and Mercury, with other old\r\nheads. All these noble statues, etc., belong to the city, and cannot be\r\ndisposed of to any private person, or removed hence, but are preserved\r\nfor the honor of the place, though great sums have been offered for them\r\nby divers Princes, lovers of art, and antiquity. We now left the Capitol,\r\ncertainly one of the most renowned places in the world, even as now built\r\nby the design of the famous M. Angelo.\r\n\r\nReturning home by Ara Coeli, we mounted to it by more than 100 marble\r\nsteps, not in devotion, as I observed some to do on their bare knees, but\r\nto see those two famous statues of Constantine, in white marble, placed\r\nthere out of his baths. In this church is a Madonna, reported to be\r\npainted by St. Luke, and a column, on which we saw the print of a foot,\r\nwhich they affirm to have been that of the Angel, seen on the Castle of\r\nSt. Angelo. Here the feast of our Blessed Savior's nativity being yearly\r\ncelebrated with divers pageants, they began to make the preparation.\r\nHaving viewed the Palace and fountain, at the other side of the stairs,\r\nwe returned weary to our lodgings.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of November, we went again near the Capitol, toward the\r\nTarpeian rock, where it has a goodly prospect of the Tiber. Thence,\r\ndescending by the Tullianum, where they told us St. Peter was imprisoned,\r\nthey showed us a chapel (S. Pietro de Vincoli) in which a rocky side of\r\nit bears the impression of his face. In the nave of the church gushes a\r\nfountain, which they say was caused by the Apostle's prayers, when having\r\nconverted some of his fellow-captives he wanted water to make them\r\nChristians. The painting of the Ascension is by Raphael. We then walked\r\nabout Mount Palatinus and the Aventine, and thence to the Circus Maximus,\r\ncapable of holding 40,000 spectators, now a heap of ruins, converted into\r\ngardens. Then by the _Forum Boarium_, where they have a tradition that\r\nHercules slew Cacus, some ruins of his temple remaining. The Temple of\r\nJanus Quadrifrons, having four arches, importing the four Seasons, and on\r\neach side niches for the months, is still a substantial and pretty entire\r\nantiquity. Near to this is the Arcus Argentariorum. Bending now toward\r\nthe Tiber, we went into the Theater of Marcellus, which would hold 80,000\r\npersons, built by Augustus, and dedicated to his nephew; the\r\narchitecture, from what remains, appears to be inferior to none. It is\r\nnow wholly converted into the house of the Savelli, one of the old Roman\r\nfamilies. The people were now generally busy in erecting temporary\r\ntriumphs and arches with statues and flattering inscriptions against his\r\nHoliness's grand procession to St. John di Laterani, among which the Jews\r\nalso began one in testimony of gratitude for their protection under the\r\nPapal State. The Palazzo Barberini, designed by the present Pope's\r\narchitect, Cavaliero Bernini, seems from the size to be as princely an\r\nobject, as any modern building in Europe. It has a double portico, at the\r\nend of which we ascended by two pair of oval stairs, all of stone, and\r\nvoid in the well. One of these led us into a stately hall, the _volto_\r\nwhereof was newly painted _á fresco_, by the rare hand of Pietro\r\nBerretini il Cortone. To this is annexed a gallery completely furnished\r\nwith whatever art can call rare and singular, and a library full of\r\nworthy collections, medals, marbles, and manuscripts; but, above all, an\r\nEgyptian Osiris, remarkable for its unknown material and antiquity. In\r\none of the rooms near this hangs the Sposaliccio of St. Sebastian, the\r\noriginal of Annibal Caracci, of which I procured a copy, little inferior\r\nto the prototype; a table, in my judgment, superior to anything I had\r\nseen in Rome. In the court is a vast broken guglia, or obelisk, having\r\ndivers hieroglyphics cut on it.\r\n\r\n8th November, 1644. We visited the Jesuits' Church, the front whereof is\r\nesteemed a noble piece of architecture, the design of Jacomo della Porta\r\nand the famous Vignola. In this church lies the body of their renowned\r\nIgnatius Loyola, an arm of Xaverius, their other Apostle; and, at the\r\nright end of their high altar, their champion, Cardinal Bellarmine. Here\r\nFather Kircher (professor of Mathematics and the oriental tongues) showed\r\nus many singular courtesies, leading us into their refectory,\r\ndispensatory, laboratory, gardens, and finally (through a hall hung round\r\nwith pictures of such of their order as had been executed for their\r\npragmatical and busy adventures) into his own study, where, with Dutch\r\npatience, he showed us his perpetual motions, catoptrics, magnetical\r\nexperiments, models, and a thousand other crotchets and devices, most of\r\nthem since published by himself, or his industrious scholar, Schotti.\r\n\r\nReturning home, we had time to view the Palazzo de Medicis, which was an\r\nhouse of the Duke of Florence near our lodging, upon the brow of Mons\r\nPincius, having a fine prospect toward the Campo Marzo. It is a\r\nmagnificent, strong building, with a substruction very remarkable, and a\r\nportico supported with columns toward the gardens, with two huge lions,\r\nof marble, at the end of the balustrade. The whole outside of the\r\n_facciata_ is incrusted with antique and rare basso-relievos and statues.\r\nDescending into the garden is a noble fountain governed by a Mercury of\r\nbrass. At a little distance, on the left, is a lodge full of fine\r\nstatues, among which the Sabines, antique and singularly rare. In the\r\narcade near this stand twenty-four statues of great price, and hard by is\r\na mount planted with cypresses, representing a fortress, with a goodly\r\nfountain in the middle. Here is also a row balustred with white marble,\r\ncovered over with the natural shrubs, ivy, and other perennial greens,\r\ndivers statues and heads being placed as in niches. At a little distance\r\nare those famed statues of Niobe and her family, in all fifteen, as large\r\nas the life, of which we have ample mention in Pliny, esteemed among the\r\nbest pieces of work in the world for the passions they express, and all\r\nother perfections of that stupendous art. There is likewise in this\r\ngarden a fair obelisk, full of hieroglyphics. In going out, the fountain\r\nbefore the front casts water near fifty feet in height, when it is\r\nreceived in a most ample marble basin. Here they usually rode the great\r\nhorse every morning; which gave me much diversion from the terrace of my\r\nown chamber, where I could see all their motions. This evening, I was\r\ninvited to hear rare music at the Chiesa Nova; the black marble pillars\r\nwithin led us to that most precious oratory of Philippus Nerius, their\r\nfounder; they being of the oratory of secular priests, under no vow.\r\nThere are in it divers good pictures, as the Assumption of Girolamo\r\nMutiano; the Crucifix; the Visitation of Elizabeth; the Presentation of\r\nthe Blessed Virgin; Christo Sepolto, of Guido Rheno, Caravaggio, Arpino,\r\nand others. This fair church consists of fourteen altars, and as many\r\nchapels. In it is buried (besides their Saint) Cæsar Baronius, the great\r\nannalist. Through this, we went into the _sacristia_, where, the tapers\r\nbeing lighted, one of the Order preached; after him stepped up a child of\r\neight or nine years old, who pronounced an oration with so much grace,\r\nthat I never was better pleased than to hear Italian so well and so\r\nintelligently spoken. This course it seems they frequently use, to bring\r\ntheir scholars to a habit of speaking distinctly, and forming their\r\naction and assurance, which none so much want as ours in England. This\r\nbeing finished, began their _motettos_, which in a lofty cupola richly\r\npainted, were sung by eunuchs, and other rare voices, accompanied by\r\ntheorbos, harpsichords, and viols, so that we were even ravished with the\r\nentertainment of the evening. This room is painted by Cortona, and has in\r\nit two figures in the niches, and the church stands in one of the most\r\nstately streets of Rome.\r\n\r\n10th November, 1644. We went to see Prince Ludovisio's villa, where was\r\nformerly the _Viridarium_ of the poet, Sallust. The house is very\r\nmagnificent, and the extent of the ground exceedingly large, considering\r\nthat it is in a city; in every quarter of the garden are antique statues,\r\nand walks planted with cypress. To this garden belongs a house of\r\nretirement, built in the figure of a cross, after a particular\r\nordonnance, especially the staircase. The whiteness and smoothness of the\r\nexcellent pargeting was a thing I much observed, being almost as even and\r\npolished, as if it had been of marble. Above, is a fair prospect of the\r\ncity. In one of the chambers hang two famous pieces of Bassano, the one a\r\nVulcan, the other a Nativity; there is a German clock full of rare and\r\nextraordinary motions; and, in a little room below are many precious\r\nmarbles, columns, urns, vases, and noble statues of porphyry, oriental\r\nalabaster, and other rare materials. About this fabric is an ample area,\r\nenvironed with sixteen vast jars of red earth, wherein the Romans used to\r\npreserve their oil, or wine rather, which they buried, and such as are\r\nproperly called _testæ_. In the Palace I must never forget the famous\r\nstatue of the Gladiator, spoken of by Pliny, so much followed by all the\r\nrare artists as the many copies testify, dispersed through almost all\r\nEurope, both in stone and metal. There is also a Hercules, a head of\r\nporphyry, and one of Marcus Aurelius. In the villa-house is a man's body\r\nflesh and all, petrified, and even converted to marble, as it was found\r\nin the Alps, and sent by the Emperor to one of the Popes; it lay in a\r\nchest, or coffin, lined with black velvet, and one of the arms being\r\nbroken, you may see the perfect bone from the flesh which remains entire.\r\nThe Rape of Proserpine, in marble, is of the purest white, the work of\r\nBernini. In the cabinet near it are innumerable small brass figures, and\r\nother curiosities. But what some look upon as exceeding all the rest, is\r\na very rich bedstead (which sort of gross furniture the Italians much\r\nglory in, as formerly did our grandfathers in England in their inlaid\r\nwooden ones) inlaid with all sorts of precious stones and antique heads,\r\nonyxes, agates, and cornelians, esteemed to be worth 80 or 90,000 crowns.\r\nHere are also divers cabinets and tables of the Florence work, besides\r\npictures in the gallery, especially the Apollo--a conceited chair to\r\nsleep in with the legs stretched out, with hooks, and pieces of wood to\r\ndraw out longer or shorter.\r\n\r\nFrom this villa, we went to see Signor Angeloni's study, who very\r\ncourteously showed us such a collection of rare medals as is hardly to be\r\nparalleled; divers good pictures, and many outlandish and Indian\r\ncuriosities, and things of nature.\r\n\r\nFrom him, we walked to Monte Cavallo, heretofore called Mons Quirinalis,\r\nwhere we saw those two rare horses, the work of the rivals Phidias and\r\nPraxiteles, as they were sent to Nero (by Tiridates King) out of Armenia.\r\nThey were placed on pedestals of white marble by Sextus V., by whom I\r\nsuppose their injuries were repaired, and are governed by four naked\r\nslaves, like those at the foot of the Capitol. Here runs a most noble\r\nfountain, regarding four of the most stately streets for building and\r\nbeauty to be seen in any city of Europe. Opposite to these statues is the\r\nPope's summer palace, built by Gregory XIII.; and, in my opinion, it is,\r\nfor largeness and the architecture, one of the most conspicuous in Rome,\r\nhaving a stately portico which leads round the court under columns, in\r\nthe centre of which there runs a beautiful fountain. The chapel is\r\nincrusted with such precious materials, that nothing can be more rich,\r\nor glorious, nor are the other ornaments and movables about it at all\r\ninferior. The hall is painted by Lanfranci, and others. The garden, which\r\nis called the Belvedere di Monte Cavallo, in emulation of that of the\r\nVatican, is most excellent for air and prospect; its exquisite fountains,\r\nclose walks, grots, piscinas, or stews for fish, planted about with\r\nvenerable cypresses, and refreshed with water-music, aviaries, and other\r\nrarities.\r\n\r\n12th November, 1644. We saw Dioclesian's Baths, whose ruins testify the\r\nvastness of the original foundation and magnificence; by what M. Angelo\r\ntook from the ornaments about it, 'tis said he restored the then almost\r\nlost art of architecture. This monstrous pile was built by the labor of\r\nthe primitive Christians, then under one of the ten great persecutions.\r\nThe Church of St. Bernardo is made out of one only of these ruinous\r\ncupolas, and is in the form of an urn with a cover.\r\n\r\nOpposite to this, is the Fontana delle Therme, otherwise called _Fons\r\nFelix_; in it is a basso-relievo of white marble, representing Moses\r\nstriking the rock, which is adorned with camels, men, women, and children\r\ndrinking, as large as life; a work for the design and vastness truly\r\nmagnificent. The water is conveyed no less than twenty-two miles in an\r\naqueduct by Sextus V., _ex agro Columna_, by way of Præneste, as the\r\ninscription testifies. It gushes into three ample lavers raised about\r\nwith stone, before which are placed two lions of a strange black stone,\r\nvery rare and antique. Near this are the store-houses for the city's\r\ncorn, and over against it the Church of St. Susanna, where were the\r\ngardens of Sallust. The faciàta of this church is noble, the _soffito_\r\nwithin gilded and full of pictures; especially famous is that of Susanna,\r\nby Baldassa di Bologna. The tribunal of the high altar is of exquisite\r\nwork, from whose marble steps you descend under ground to the repository\r\nof divers Saints. The picture over this altar is the work of Jacomo\r\nSiciliano. The foundation is for Bernadine Nuns.\r\n\r\nSanta Maria della Vittoria presents us with the most ravishing front. In\r\nthis church was sung the Te Deum by Gregory XV., after the signal victory\r\nof the Emperor at Prague; the standards then taken still hang up, and the\r\nimpress waving this motto over the Pope's arms, _Extirpentur_. I\r\nobserved that the high altar was much frequented for an image of the\r\nVirgin. It has some rare statues, as Paul ravished into the third heaven,\r\nby Fiamingo, and some good pictures. From this, we bent toward\r\nDioclesian's Baths, never satisfied with contemplating that immense pile,\r\nin building which 150,000 Christians were destined to labor fourteen\r\nyears, and were then all murdered. Here is a monastery of Carthusians,\r\ncalled Santa Maria degli Angeli, the architecture of M. Angelo, and the\r\ncloister encompassing walls in an ample garden.\r\n\r\nMont Alto's villa is entered by a stately gate of stone built on the\r\nViminalis, and is no other than a spacious park full of fountains,\r\nespecially that which salutes us at the front; stews for fish; the\r\ncypress walks are so beset with statues, inscriptions, relievos, and\r\nother ancient marbles, that nothing can be more stately and solemn. The\r\ncitron trees are uncommonly large. In the palace joining to it are\r\ninnumerable collections of value. Returning, we stepped into St. Agnes\r\nchurch, where there is a tribunal of antique mosaic, and on the altar a\r\nmost rich ciborio of brass, with a statue of St. Agnes in oriental\r\nalabaster. The church of Santa Constanza has a noble cupola. Here they\r\nshowed us a stone ship borne on a column heretofore sacred to Bacchus, as\r\nthe relievo intimates by the drunken emblems and instruments wrought upon\r\nit. The altar is of rich porphyry, as I remember. Looking back, we had\r\nthe entire view of the Via Pia down to the two horses before the Monte\r\nCavallo, before mentioned, one of the most glorious sights for state and\r\nmagnificence that any city can show a traveler. We returned by Porta Pia,\r\nand the Via Salaria, near Campo Scelerato, in whose gloomy caves the\r\nwanton Vestals were heretofore immured alive.\r\n\r\nThence to Via Felix, a straight and noble street but very precipitous,\r\ntill we came to the four fountains of Lepidus, built at the abutments of\r\nfour stately ways, making an exact cross of right angles; and, at the\r\nfountains, are as many cumbent figures of marble, under very large niches\r\nof stone, the water pouring into huge basins. The church of St. Carlo is\r\na singular fabric for neatness, of an oval design, built of a new white\r\nstone; the columns are worth notice. Under it is another church of a\r\nstructure nothing less admirable.\r\n\r\nNext, we came to Santa Maria Maggiore, built upon the Esqueline Mountain,\r\nwhich gives it a most conspicuous face to the street at a great distance.\r\nThe design is mixed partly antique, partly modern. Here they affirm that\r\nthe Blessed Virgin appearing, showed where it should be built 300 years\r\nsince. The first pavement is rare and antique; so is the portico built by\r\nP. P. Eugenius II. The _ciborio_ is the work of Paris Romano, and the\r\ntribunal of Mosaic.\r\n\r\nWe were showed in the church a _concha_ of porphyry, wherein they say\r\nPatricius, the founder, lies. This is one of the most famous of the seven\r\nRoman Churches, and is, in my opinion at least, after St. Peter's, the\r\nmost magnificent. Above all, for incomparable glory and materials, are\r\nthe two chapels of Sextus V. and Paulus V. That of Sextus was designed by\r\nDom. Fontana, in which are two rare great statues, and some good pieces\r\nof painting; and here they pretended to show some of the Holy Innocents'\r\nbodies slain by Herod: as also that renowned tabernacle of metal, gilt,\r\nsustained by four angels, holding as many tapers, placed on the altar. In\r\nthis chapel is the statue of Sextus, in copper, with basso-relievos of\r\nmost of his famous acts, in Parian marble; but that of P. Paulus, which\r\nwe next entered, opposite to this, is beyond all imagination glorious,\r\nand above description. It is so encircled with agates, and other most\r\nprecious materials, as to dazzle and confound the beholders. The\r\nbasso-relievos are for the most part of pure snowy marble, intermixed\r\nwith figures of molten brass, double gilt, on _lapis lazuli_. The altar\r\nis a most stupendous piece; but most incomparable is the cupola painted\r\nby Giuseppe Rheni, and the present Baglioni, full of exquisite\r\nsculptures. There is a most sumptuous _sacristia_; and the piece over the\r\naltar was by the hand of St. Luke; if you will believe it. Paulus V. hath\r\nhere likewise built two other altars; under the one lie the bones of the\r\nApostle, St. Matthias. In another oratory, is the statue of this Pope,\r\nand the head of the Congo Ambassador, who was converted at Rome, and died\r\nhere. In a third chapel, designed by Michael Angelo, lie the bodies of\r\nPlatina, and the Cardinal of Toledo, Honorius III., Nicephorus IV., the\r\nashes of St. Hierom, and many others. In that of Sextus V., before\r\nmentioned, was showed us part of the crib in which Christ was swaddled\r\nat Bethlehem; there is also the statue of Pius V.; and going out at the\r\nfurther end, is the resurrection of Lazarus, by a very rare hand. In the\r\nportico, is this late inscription: \"_Cardinal Antonio Barberino\r\nArchypresbytero, aream marmoream quam Christianorum pietas exsculpsit,\r\nlaborante sub Tyrannis ecclesiâ, ut esset loci sanctitate venerabilior,\r\nFrancis Gualdus Arm. Eques S. Stephani è suis ædibus huc transtulit et\r\nornavit, 1632_.\" Just before this portico, stands a very sublime and\r\nstately Corinthian column, of white marble, translated hither for an\r\nornament from the old Temple of Peace, built by Vespasian, having on the\r\nplinth of the capital the image of our Lady, gilt on metal; at the\r\npedestal runs a fountain. Going down the hill, we saw the obelisk taken\r\nfrom the Mausoleum of Augustus, and erected in this place by Domenico\r\nFontana, with this epigraph: \"_Sextus V. Pont. Max. Obeliscum ex Egypto\r\nadvectum, Augusti in Mausoleo dicatum, eversum deinde et in plures\r\nconfractum partes, in via ad S. Rochum jacentem, in pristinam faciem\r\nrestitutum Salutiferæ Cruci feliciùs hic erigi jussit, anno MDLXXXVIII,\r\nPont. III_\"; and so we came weary to our lodgings.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of this hill, is the church of St. Prudentia, in which is a\r\nwell, filled with the blood and bones of several martyrs, but grated over\r\nwith iron, and visited by many devotees. Near this stands the church of\r\nher sister, S. Praxedeis, much frequented for the same reason. In a\r\nlittle obscure place, canceled in with iron work, is the pillar, or\r\nstump, at which they relate our Blessed Savior was scourged, being full\r\nof bloody spots, at which the devout sex are always rubbing their\r\nchaplets, and convey their kisses by a stick having a tassel on it. Here,\r\nbesides a noble statue of St. Peter, is the tomb of the famous Cardinal\r\nCajetan, an excellent piece; and here they hold that St. Peter said his\r\nfirst mass at Rome, with the same altar and the stone he kneeled on, he\r\nhaving been first lodged in this house, as they compute about the\r\nforty-fourth year of the Incarnation. They also show many relics, or\r\nrather rags, of his mantle. St. Laurence in Panisperna did next invite\r\nus, where that martyr was cruelly broiled on the gridiron, there yet\r\nremaining. St. Bridget is buried in this church under a stately monument.\r\nIn the front of the pile is the suffering of St. Laurence painted _á\r\nfresco_ on the wall. The fabric is nothing but Gothic. On the left is the\r\nTherma Novatii; and, on the right, Agrippina's Lavacrum.\r\n\r\n14th November, 1644. We passed again through the stately Capitol and\r\nCampo Vaccino toward the Amphitheater of Vespasian, but first stayed to\r\nlook at Titus's Triumphal Arch, erected by the people of Rome, in honor\r\nof his victory at Jerusalem; on the left hand whereof he is represented\r\ndrawn in a chariot with four horses abreast; on the right hand, or side\r\nof the arch within, is sculptured in figures, or basso-relievo as big as\r\nthe life (and in one entire marble) the Ark of the Covenant, on which\r\nstands the seven-branched candlestick described in Leviticus, as also the\r\ntwo Tables of the Law, all borne on men's shoulders by the bars, as they\r\nare described in some of St. Hierom's bibles; before this, go many\r\ncrowned and laureated figures, and twelve Roman _fasces_ with other\r\nsacred vessels. This much confirmed the idea I before had; and therefore,\r\nfor the light it gave to the Holy History, I caused my painter, Carlo, to\r\ncopy it exactly. The rest of the work of the Arch is of the noblest, best\r\nunderstood _composita_; and the inscription is this, in capital letters:\r\n\r\n                      S. P. Q. R.\r\n    D. TITO, D. VESPASIANI, F. VESPASIANI AVGVSTO.\r\n\r\nSanta Maria Nova is on the place where they told us Simon Magus fell out\r\nof the air at St. Peter's prayer, and burst himself to pieces on a flint.\r\nNear this is a marble monument, erected by the people of Rome in memory\r\nof the Pope's return from Avignon. Being now passed the ruins of\r\nMeta-Sudante (which stood before the Colosseum, so called, because there\r\nonce stood here the statue of Commodus provided to refresh the\r\ngladiators), we enter the mighty ruins of the Vespasian Amphitheatre,\r\nbegun by Vespasian, and finished by that excellent prince, Titus. It is\r\n830 Roman palms in length (_i.e._ 130 paces), 90 in breadth at the area,\r\nwith caves for the wild beasts which used to be baited by men instead of\r\ndogs; the whole oval periphery 2888-4/7 palms, and capable of containing\r\n87,000 spectators with ease and all accommodation: the three rows of\r\ncircles are yet entire; the first was for the senators, the middle for\r\nthe nobility, the third for the people. At the dedication of this place\r\nwere 5,000 wild beasts slain in three months during which the feast\r\nlasted, to the expense of ten millions of gold. It was built of Tiburtine\r\nstone, a vast height, with the five orders of architecture, by 30,000\r\ncaptive Jews. It is without, of a perfect circle, and was once adorned\r\nthick with statues, and remained entire, till of late that some of the\r\nstones were carried away to repair the city walls and build the Farnesian\r\npalace. That which still appears most admirable is, the contrivance of\r\nthe porticos, vaults, and stairs, with the excessive altitude, which well\r\ndeserves this distich of the poet:\r\n\r\n    \"_Omnis Cæsareo cedat labor Amphitheatro;\r\n    Unum pro cunctis fama loquatur opus._\"\r\n\r\nNear it is a small chapel called Santa Maria della Pieta nel Colisseo,\r\nwhich is erected on the steps, or stages, very lofty at one of its sides,\r\nor ranges, within, and where there lives only a melancholy hermit. I\r\nascended to the very top of it with wonderful admiration.\r\n\r\nThe Arch of Constantine the Great is close by the Meta-Sudante, before\r\nmentioned, at the beginning of the Via Appia, on one side Monte Celio,\r\nand is perfectly entire, erected by the people in memory of his victory\r\nover Maxentius, at the Pons Milvius, now Ponte Mole. In the front is this\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n    IMP. CAES. FL. CONSTANTINO MAXIMO\r\n        P. F. AVGVSTO S. P. Q. R.\r\n    QVOD INSTINCTV DIVINITATIS MENTIS\r\n       MAGNITVDINE CVM EXERCITV SVO\r\n     TAM DE TYRANNO QVAM DE OMNI EIVS\r\n       FACTIONE VNO TEMPORE IVSTIS\r\n       REMPVBLICAM VLTVS EST ARMIS\r\n    ARCVM TRIVMPHIS INSIGNEM DICAVIT.\r\n\r\nHence, we went to St. Gregorio, in Monte Celio, where are many privileged\r\naltars, and there they showed us an arm of that saint, and other relics.\r\nBefore this church stands a very noble portico.\r\n\r\n15th November, 1644. Was very wet, and I stirred not out, and the 16th I\r\nwent to visit Father John, Provincial of the Benedictines.\r\n\r\n17th November, 1644. I walked to Villa Borghese, a house and ample garden\r\non Mons Pincius, yet somewhat without the city walls, circumscribed by\r\nanother wall full of small turrets and banqueting-houses; which makes it\r\nappear at a distance like a little town. Within it is an elysium of\r\ndelight, having in the centre of it a noble palace; but the entrance of\r\nthe garden presents us with a very glorious fabric, or rather door-case,\r\nadorned with divers excellent marble statues. This garden abounded with\r\nall sorts of delicious fruit and exotic simples, fountains of sundry\r\ninventions, groves, and small rivulets. There is also adjoining to it a\r\nvivarium for ostriches, peacocks, swans, cranes, etc., and divers strange\r\nbeasts, deer, and hares. The grotto is very rare, and represents, among\r\nother devices, artificial rain, and sundry shapes of vessels, flowers,\r\netc.; which is effected by changing the heads of the fountains. The\r\ngroves are of cypress, laurel, pine, myrtle, and olive. The four sphinxes\r\nare very antique, and worthy observation. To this is a volary, full of\r\ncurious birds. The house is square with turrets, from which the prospect\r\nis excellent toward Rome, and the environing hills, covered as they now\r\nare with snow, which indeed commonly continues even a great part of the\r\nsummer, affording sweet refreshment. Round the house is a baluster of\r\nwhite marble, with frequent jettos of water, and adorned with a multitude\r\nof statues. The walls of the house are covered with antique incrustations\r\nof history, as that of Curtius, the Rape of Europa, Leda, etc. The\r\ncornices above consist of fruitages and festoons, between which are\r\nniches furnished with statues, which order is observed to the very roof.\r\nIn the lodge, at the entry, are divers good statues of Consuls, etc.,\r\nwith two pieces of field artillery upon carriages, (a mode much practiced\r\nin Italy before the great men's houses) which they look on as a piece of\r\nstate more than defense. In the first hall within, are the twelve Roman\r\nEmperors, of excellent marble; between them stand porphyry columns, and\r\nother precious stones of vast height and magnitude, with urns of oriental\r\nalabaster. Tables of pietra-commessa: and here is that renowned Diana\r\nwhich Pompey worshiped, of eastern marble: the most incomparable Seneca\r\nof touch, bleeding in an huge vase of porphyry, resembling the drops of\r\nhis blood; the so famous Gladiator, and the Hermaphrodite upon a quilt of\r\nstone. The new piece of Daphne, and David, of Cavaliero Bernini, is\r\nobservable for the pure whiteness of the stone, and the art of the\r\nstatuary plainly stupendous. There is a multitude of rare pictures of\r\ninfinite value, by the best masters; huge tables of porphyry, and two\r\nexquisitely wrought vases of the same. In another chamber, are divers\r\nsorts of instruments of music: among other toys that of a satyr, which so\r\nartificially expressed a human voice, with the motion of eyes and head,\r\nthat it might easily afright one who was not prepared for that most\r\nextravagant sight. They showed us also a chair that catches fast any one\r\nwho sits down in it, so as not to be able to stir out, by certain springs\r\nconcealed in the arms and back thereof, which at sitting down surprises a\r\nman on the sudden, locking him in by the arms and thighs, after a true\r\ntreacherous Italian guise. The perspective is also considerable, composed\r\nby the position of looking-glasses, which render a strange multiplication\r\nof things resembling divers most richly furnished rooms. Here stands a\r\nrare clock of German work; in a word, nothing but what is magnificent is\r\nto be seen in this Paradise.\r\n\r\nThe next day, I went to the Vatican, where, in the morning, I saw the\r\nceremony of Pamfilio, the Pope's nephew, receiving a Cardinal's hat; this\r\nwas the first time I had seen his Holiness _in pontificalibus_. After the\r\nCardinals and Princes had met in the consistory, the ceremony was in the\r\nPope's chapel, where he was at the altar invested with most pompous\r\nrites.\r\n\r\n19th November, 1644. I visited St. Peter's, that most stupendous and\r\nincomparable Basilica, far surpassing any now extant in the world, and\r\nperhaps, Solomon's Temple excepted, any that was ever built. The\r\nlargeness of the piazza before the portico is worth observing, because it\r\naffords a noble prospect of the church, not crowded up, as for the most\r\npart is the case in other places where great churches are erected. In\r\nthis is a fountain, out of which gushes a river rather than a stream\r\nwhich, ascending a good height, breaks upon a round emboss of marble into\r\nmillions of pearls that fall into the subjacent basins with great noise;\r\nI esteem this one of the goodliest fountains I ever saw.\r\n\r\nNext is the obelisk transported out of Egypt, and dedicated by Octavius\r\nAugustus to Julius Cæsar, whose ashes it formerly bore on the summit;\r\nbut, being since overturned by the barbarians, was re-erected with vast\r\ncost and a most stupendous invention by Domenico Fontana, architect to\r\nSextus V. The obelisk consists of one entire square stone without\r\nhieroglyphics, in height seventy-two feet, but comprehending the base and\r\nall it is 108 feet high, and rests on four lions of gilded copper, so as\r\nyou may see through the base of the obelisk and plinth of the pedestal.\r\n\r\nUpon two faces of the obelisk is engraven\r\n\r\n      DIVO CAES. DIVI\r\n     IVLII F. AVGVSTO\r\n    TI. CAES. DIVI AVG.\r\n     F. AVGVS. SACRVM.\r\n\r\nIt now bears on the top a cross in which it is said that Sextus V.\r\ninclosed some of the holy wood; and under it is to be read by good eyes:\r\n\r\n        SANCTISSIMAE CRVCI\r\n       SEXTVS V. PONT. MAX.\r\n           CONSECRAVIT.\r\n      E. PRIORE SEDE AVVLSVM\r\n      ET CAESS. AVG. AC TIB.\r\n    I. L. ABLATUM M.D.LXXXVI.\r\n\r\nOn the four faces of the base below:\r\n\r\n           1.

PONT. II.\r\n\r\nA little lower:\r\n\r\n    DOMINICVS FONTANA EX PAGO MILIAGRI NOVOCOMENSIS\r\n                   TRANSTVLIT ET EREXIT.\r\n\r\nIt is reported to have taken a year in erecting, to have cost 37,975\r\ncrowns, the labor of 907 men, and 75 horses: this being the first of the\r\nfour Egyptian obelisks set up at Rome, and one of the forty-two brought\r\nto the city out of Egypt, set up in several places, but thrown down by\r\nthe Goths, Barbarians, and earthquakes. Some coaches stood before the\r\nsteps of the ascent, whereof one, belonging to Cardinal Medici, had all\r\nthe metal work of massy silver, viz, the bow behind and other places. The\r\ncoaches at Rome, as well as covered wagons also much in use, are\r\ngenerally the richest and largest I ever saw. Before the _facciata_ of\r\nthe church is an ample pavement. The church was first begun by St.\r\nAnacletus, when rather a chapel, on a foundation, as they give out, of\r\nConstantine the Great, who, in honor of the Apostles, carried twelve\r\nbaskets full of sand to the work. After him, Julius II. took it in hand,\r\nto which all his successors have contributed more or less.\r\n\r\nThe front is supposed to be the largest and best-studied piece of\r\narchitecture in the world; to this we went up by four steps of marble.\r\nThe first entrance is supported by huge pilasters; the _volto_ within is\r\nthe richest possible, and overlaid with gold. Between the five large\r\nanti-ports are columns of enormous height and compass, with as many gates\r\nof brass, the work and sculpture of Pollaivola, the Florentine, full of\r\ncast figures and histories in a deep relievo. Over this runs a terrace of\r\nlike amplitude and ornament, where the Pope, at solemn times, bestows his\r\nBenediction on the vulgar. On each side of this portico are two\r\n_campaniles_, or towers, whereof there was but one perfected, of\r\nadmirable art. On the top of all, runs a balustrade which edges it quite\r\nround, and upon this at equal distances are Christ and the twelve\r\nDisciples of gigantic size and stature, yet below showing no greater than\r\nthe life. Entering the church, admirable is the breadth of the _volto_,\r\nor roof, which is all carved with foliage and roses overlaid with gold in\r\nnature of a deep basso-relievo, _à l'antique_. The nave, or body, is in\r\nform of a cross, whereof the foot-part is the longest; and, at the\r\n_internodium_ of the transept, rises the cupola, which being all of stone\r\nand of prodigious height is more in compass than that of the Pantheon\r\n(which was the largest among the old Romans, and is yet entire) or any\r\nother known. The inside, or concave, is covered with most exquisite\r\nMosaic, representing the Celestial Hierarchy, by Giuseppe d'Arpino, full\r\nof stars of gold; the convex, or outside, exposed to the air, is covered\r\nwith lead, with great ribs of metal double gilt (as are also the ten\r\nother lesser cupolas, for no fewer adorn this glorious structure), which\r\ngives a great and admirable splendor in all parts of the city. On the\r\nsummit of this is fixed a brazen globe gilt, capable of receiving\r\nthirty-five persons. This I entered, and engraved my name among other\r\ntravelers. Lastly, is the Cross, the access to which is between the\r\nleaden covering and the stone convex, or arch-work; a most truly\r\nastonishing piece of art! On the battlements of the church, also all\r\noverlaid with lead and marble, you would imagine yourself in a town, so\r\nmany are the cupolas, pinnacles, towers, juttings, and not a few houses\r\ninhabited by men who dwell there, and have enough to do to look after the\r\nvast reparations which continually employ them.\r\n\r\nHaving seen this, we descended into the body of the church, full of\r\ncollateral chapels and large oratories, most of them exceeding the size\r\nof ordinary churches; but the principal are four incrusted with most\r\nprecious marbles and stones of various colors, adorned with an infinity\r\nof statues, pictures, stately altars, and innumerable relics. The\r\naltar-piece of St. Michael being of Mosaic, I could not pass without\r\nparticular note, as one of the best of that kind. The chapel of Gregory\r\nXIII., where he is buried, is most splendid. Under the cupola, and in the\r\ncenter of the church, stands the high altar, consecrated first by Clement\r\nVIII., adorned by Paul V., and lately covered by Pope Urban VIII.; with\r\nthat stupendous canopy of Corinthian brass, which heretofore was brought\r\nfrom the Pantheon; it consists of four wreathed columns, partly\r\nchannelled and encircled with vines, on which hang little _puti_ birds\r\nand bees (the arms of the _Barberini_), sustaining a _baldacchino_ of the\r\nsame metal. The four columns weigh an hundred and ten thousand pounds,\r\nall over richly gilt; this, with the pedestals, crown, and statues about\r\nit, form a thing of that art, vastness, and magnificence, as is beyond\r\nall that man's industry has produced of the kind; it is the work of\r\nBernini, a Florentine sculptor, architect, painter, and poet, who, a\r\nlittle before my coming to the city, gave a public opera (for so they\r\ncall shows of that kind), wherein he painted the scenes, cut the statues,\r\ninvented the engines, composed the music, writ the comedy, and built the\r\ntheater. Opposite to either of these pillars, under those niches which,\r\nwith their columns, support the weighty cupola, are placed four exquisite\r\nstatues of Parian marble, to which are four altars; that of St. Veronica,\r\nmade by Fra. Mochi, has over it the reliquary, where they showed us the\r\nmiraculous _Sudarium_ indued with the picture of our Savior's face, with\r\nthis inscription: \"_Salvatoris imaginem Veronicæ Sudario exceptam ut loci\r\nmajestas decentèr custodiret, Urbanus VIII. Pont. Max. Marmoreum signum\r\net Altare addidit, Conditorium extruxit et ornavit_.\"\r\n\r\nRight against this is that of Longinus, of a Colossean magnitude, also by\r\nBernini, and over him the conservatory of the iron lance inserted in a\r\nmost precious crystal, with this epigraph: \"_Longini Lanceam quam\r\nInnocentius VIII. à Bajazete Turcarum Tyranno accepit, Urbanus VIII.\r\nstatuâ appositâ, et Sacello substructo, in exornatum Conditorium\r\ntranstulit_.\"\r\n\r\nThe third chapel has over the altar the statue of our countrywoman, St.\r\nHelena, the mother of Constantine the Great; the work of Boggi, an\r\nexcellent sculptor; and here is preserved a great piece of the pretended\r\nwood of the holy cross, which she is said to have first detected\r\nmiraculously in the Holy Land. It was placed here by the late Pope with\r\nthis inscription: \"_Partem Crucis quam Helena Imperatrix è Calvario in\r\nUrbem adduxit, Urbanus VIII. Pont. Max. è Sissorianâ Basilicâ desumptam,\r\nadditis arâ et statuâ, hìc in Vaticano collocavit_.\"\r\n\r\nThe fourth hath over the altar, and opposite to that of St. Veronica, the\r\nstatue of St. Andrew, the work of Fiamingo, admirable above all the\r\nother; above is preserved the head of that Apostle, richly enchased. It\r\nis said that this excellent sculptor died mad to see his statue placed in\r\na disadvantageous light by Bernini, the chief architect, who found\r\nhimself outdone by this artist. The inscription over it is this:\r\n\r\n    \"_St. Andreæ caput quod Pius II. ex Achaiâ in Vaticanum asportandum\r\n    curavit, Urbanus VIII. novis hic ornamentis decoratum sacrisque\r\n    statuæ ac Sacelli honoribus coli voluit._\"\r\n\r\nThe relics showed and kept in this church are without number, as are also\r\nthe precious vessels of gold, silver, and gems, with the vests and\r\nservices to be seen in the Sacristy, which they showed us. Under the high\r\naltar is an ample grot inlaid with _pietra-commessa_, wherein half of the\r\nbodies of St. Peter and St. Paul are preserved; before hang divers great\r\nlamps of the richest plate, burning continually. About this and\r\ncontiguous to the altar, runs a balustrade, in form of a theater, of\r\nblack marble. Toward the left, as you go out of the church by the\r\nportico, a little beneath the high altar, is an old brass statue of St.\r\nPeter sitting, under the soles of whose feet many devout persons rub\r\ntheir heads, and touch their chaplets. This was formerly cast from a\r\nstatue of Jupiter Capitolinus. In another place, stands a column grated\r\nabout with iron, whereon they report that our Blessed Savior was often\r\nwont to lean as he preached in the Temple. In the work of the reliquary\r\nunder the cupola there are eight wreathed columns brought from the Temple\r\nof Solomon. In another chapel, they showed us the chair of St. Peter, or,\r\nas they name it, the Apostolical Throne. But among all the chapels the\r\none most glorious has for an altar-piece a Madonna bearing a dead Christ\r\non her knees, in white marble, the work of Michael Angelo. At the upper\r\nend of the Cathedral, are several stately monuments, especially that of\r\nUrban VIII. Round the cupola, and in many other places in the church, are\r\nconfession seats, for all languages, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Spanish,\r\nItalian, French, English, Irish, Welsh, Sclavonian, Dutch, etc., as it is\r\nwritten on their friezes in golden capitals, and there are still at\r\nconfessions some of all nations. Toward the lower end of the church, and\r\non the side of a vast pillar sustaining a weighty roof, is the\r\n_depositum_ and statue of the Countess Matilda, a rare piece, with\r\nbasso-relievos about it of white marble, the work of Bernini. Here are\r\nalso those of Sextus IV. and Paulus III., etc. Among the exquisite pieces\r\nin this sumptuous fabric is that of the ship with St. Peter held up from\r\nsinking by our Savior; the emblems about it are the Mosaic of the famous\r\nGiotto, who restored and made it perfect after it had been defaced by the\r\nBarbarians. Nor is the pavement under the cupola to be passed over\r\nwithout observation, which with the rest of the body and walls of the\r\nwhole church, are all inlaid with the richest of _pietra-commessa_, in\r\nthe most splendid colors of polished marbles, agates, serpentine,\r\nporphyry, calcedon, etc., wholly incrusted to the very roof. Coming out\r\nby the portico at which we entered, we were shown the Porta Santa, never\r\nopened but at the year of jubilee. This glorious foundation hath\r\nbelonging to it thirty canons, thirty-six beneficiates, twenty-eight\r\nclerks beneficed, with innumerable chaplains, etc., a Cardinal being\r\nalways archpriest; the present Cardinal was Francisco Barberini, who also\r\nstyled himself Protector of the English, to whom he was indeed very\r\ncourteous.\r\n\r\n20th November, 1644. I went to visit that ancient See and Cathedral of\r\nSt. John di Laterano, and the holy places thereabout. This is a church of\r\nextraordinary devotion, though, for outward form, not comparable to St.\r\nPeter's, being of Gothic ordonnance. Before we went into the cathedral,\r\nthe Baptistery of St. John Baptist presented itself, being formerly part\r\nof the Great Constantine's palace, and, as it is said, his chamber where\r\nby St. Silvester he was made a Christian. It is of an octagonal shape,\r\nhaving before the entrance eight fair pillars of rich porphyry, each of\r\none entire piece, their capitals of divers orders, supporting lesser\r\ncolumns of white marble, and these supporting a noble cupola, the molding\r\nwhereof is excellently wrought. In the chapel which they affirm to have\r\nbeen the lodging place of this Emperor, all women are prohibited from\r\nentering, for the malice of Herodias who caused him to lose his head.\r\nHere are deposited several sacred relics of St. James, Mary Magdalen, St.\r\nMatthew, etc., and two goodly pictures. Another chapel, or oratory near\r\nit, is called St. John the Evangelist, well adorned with marbles and\r\ntables, especially those of Cavaliére Giuseppe, and of Tempesta, in\r\nfresco. We went hence into another called St. Venantius, in which is a\r\ntribunal all of Mosaic in figures of Popes. Here is also an altar of the\r\nMadonna, much visited, and divers Sclavonish saints, companions of Pope\r\nJohn IV. The portico of the church is built of materials brought from\r\nPontius Pilate's house in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nThe next sight which attracted our attention, was a wonderful concourse\r\nof people at their devotions before a place called _Scala Sancta_, to\r\nwhich is built a noble front. Entering the portico, we saw those large\r\nmarble stairs, twenty-eight in number, which are never ascended but on\r\nthe knees, some lip-devotion being used on every step; on which you may\r\nperceive divers red specks of blood under a grate, which they affirm to\r\nhave been drops of our Blessed Savior, at the time he was so barbarously\r\nmisused by Herod's soldiers; for these stairs are reported to have been\r\ntranslated hither from his palace in Jerusalem. At the top of them is a\r\nchapel, whereat they enter (but we could not be permitted) by gates of\r\nmarble, being the same our Savior passed when he went out of Herod's\r\nhouse. This they name the _Sanctum Sanctorum_, and over it we read this\r\nepigraph:\r\n\r\n    _Non est in toto sanctior orbe locus._\r\n\r\nHere, through a grate, we saw that picture of Christ painted (as they\r\nsay) by the hand of St. Luke, to the life. Descending again, we saw\r\nbefore the church the obelisk, which is indeed most worthy of admiration.\r\nIt formerly lay in the Circo Maximo, and was erected here by Sextus V.,\r\nin 1587, being 112 feet in height without the base or pedestal; at the\r\nfoot nine and a half one way, and eight the other. This pillar was first\r\nbrought from Thebes at the utmost confines of Egypt, to Alexandria, from\r\nthence to Constantinople, thence to Rome, and is said by Ammianus\r\nMarcellinus to have been dedicated to Rameses, King of Egypt. It was\r\ntransferred to this city by Constantine the son of the Great, and is full\r\nof hieroglyphics, serpents, men, owls, falcons, oxen, instruments, etc.,\r\ncontaining (as Father Kircher the Jesuit will shortly tell us in a book\r\nwhich he is ready to publish) all the recondite and abstruse learning of\r\nthat people. The vessel, galley, or float, that brought it to Rome so\r\nmany hundred leagues, must needs have been of wonderful bigness and\r\nstrange fabric. The stone is one and entire, and (having been thrown\r\ndown) was erected by the famous Dom. Fontana, for that magnificent Pope,\r\nSextus V., as the rest were; it is now cracked in many places, but\r\nsolidly joined. The obelisk is thus inscribed at the several faciátas:\r\n\r\n    _Fl. Constantinus Augustus, Constantini Augusti F. Obeliscum à\r\n    patre suo motum diuq; Alexandriæ jacentem, trecentorum remigum\r\n    impositum navi mirandæ vastitatis per mare Tyberimq; magnis molibus\r\n    Romam convectum in Circo Max. ponendum S.P.Q.R.D.D._\r\n\r\nOn the second square:\r\n\r\n    _Fl. Constantinus Max: Aug: Christianæ fidei Vindex & Assertor\r\n    Obeliscum ab Ægyptio Rege impuro voto Soli dicatum, sedibus avulsum\r\n    suis per Nilum transfer. Alexandriam, ut Novam Romam ab se tunc\r\n    conditam eo decoraret monumento._\r\n\r\nOn the third:\r\n\r\n    _Sextus V. Pontifex Max: Obeliscum hunc specie eximiâ temporum\r\n    calamitate fractum, Circi Maximi ruinis humo, limoq; altè demersum,\r\n    multâ impensâ extraxit, hunc in locum magno labore transtulit,\r\n    formàq; pristinâ accuratè vestitum, Cruci invictissimæ dicavit anno\r\n    M.D.LXXXVIII. Pont. IIII._\r\n\r\nOn the fourth:\r\n\r\n    _Constantinus per Crucem Victor à Silvestro hìc Baptizatus Crucis\r\n    gloriam propagavit._\r\n\r\nLeaving this wonderful monument (before which is a stately public\r\nfountain, with a statue of St. John in the middle of it), we visited His\r\nHoliness's palace, being a little on the left hand, the design of\r\nFontana, architect to Sextus V. This I take to be one of the best\r\npalaces in Rome; but not staying we entered the church of St. John di\r\nLaterano, which is properly the Cathedral of the Roman See, as I learned\r\nby these verses engraven upon the architrave of the portico:\r\n\r\n    _Dogmate Papali datur, et simul Imperiali\r\n    Quòd sim cunctarum mater caput Ecclesiar[)u]\r\n    Hinc Salvatoris coelestia regna datoris\r\n    Nomine Sanxerunt, cum cuncta peracta fuerunt;\r\n    Sic vos ex toto conversi supplice voto\r\n    Nostra quòd hæc ædes; tibi Christe sit inclyta sedes._\r\n\r\nIt is called Lateran, from a noble family formerly dwelling it seems\r\nhereabouts, on Mons Cælius. The church is Gothic, and hath a stately\r\ntribunal; the paintings are of Pietro Pisano. It was the first church\r\nthat was consecrated with the ceremonies now introduced, and where altars\r\nof stone supplied those of wood heretofore in use, and made like large\r\nchests for the easier removal in times of persecution; such an altar is\r\nstill the great one here preserved, as being that on which (they hold)\r\nSt. Peter celebrated mass at Rome; for which reason none but the Pope may\r\nnow presume to make that use of it. The pavement is of all sorts of\r\nprecious marbles, and so are the walls to a great height, over which it\r\nis painted _á fresco_ with the life and acts of Constantine the Great, by\r\nmost excellent masters. The organs are rare, supported by four columns.\r\nThe _soffito_ is all richly gilded, and full of pictures. Opposite to the\r\nporta is an altar of exquisite architecture, with a tabernacle on it all\r\nof precious stones, the work of Targoni; on this is a _coena_ of plate,\r\nthe invention of Curtius Vanni, of exceeding value; the tables hanging\r\nover it are of Giuseppe d'Arpino. About this are four excellent columns\r\ntransported out of Asia by the Emperor Titus, of brass, double gilt,\r\nabout twelve feet in height; the walls between them are incrusted with\r\nmarble and set with statues in niches, the vacuum reported to be filled\r\nwith holy earth, which St. Helena sent from Jerusalem to her son,\r\nConstantine, who set these pillars where they now stand. At one side of\r\nthis is an oratory full of rare paintings and monuments, especially those\r\nof the great Connestábile Colonna. Out of this we came into the\r\n_sacristia_, full of good pictures of Albert and others. At the end of\r\nthe church is a flat stone supported by four pillars which they affirm\r\nto have been the exact height of our Blessed Savior, and say they never\r\nfitted any mortal man that tried it, but he was either taller or shorter;\r\ntwo columns of the veil of the Temple which rent at his passion; the\r\nstone on which they threw lots for his seamless vesture; and the pillar\r\non which the cock crowed, after Peter's denial; and, to omit no fine\r\nthing, the just length of the Virgin Mary's foot as it seems her\r\nshoemaker affirmed! Here is a sumptuous cross, beset with precious\r\nstones, containing some of the VERY wood of the holy cross itself; with\r\nmany other things of this sort: also numerous most magnificent monuments,\r\nespecially those of St. Helena, of porphyry; Cardinal Farneze; Martin I.,\r\nof copper; the pictures of Mary Magdalen, Martin V., Laurentius Valla,\r\netc., are of Gaetano; the Nunciata, designed by M. Angelo; and the great\r\ncrucifix of Sermoneta. In a chapel at one end of the porch is a statue of\r\nHenry IV. of France, in brass, standing in a dark hole, and so has done\r\nmany years; perhaps from not believing him a thorough proselyte. The two\r\nfamous Oecumenical Councils were celebrated in this Church by Pope\r\nSimachus, Martin I., Stephen, etc.\r\n\r\nLeaving this venerable church (for in truth it has a certain majesty in\r\nit), we passed through a fair and large hospital of good architecture,\r\nhaving some inscriptions put up by Barberini, the late Pope's nephew. We\r\nthen went by St. Sylvia, where is a noble statue of St. Gregory P., begun\r\nby M. Angelo; a St. Andrew, and the bath of St. Cecilia. In this church\r\nare some rare paintings, especially that story on the wall of Guido Reni.\r\nThence to St. Giovanni e Paula, where the friars are reputed to be great\r\nchemists. The choir, roof, and paintings in the _tribuna_ are excellent.\r\n\r\nDescending the Mons Cælius, we came against the vestiges of the Palazzo\r\nMaggiore, heretofore the Golden House of Nero; now nothing but a heap of\r\nvast and confused ruins, to show what time and the vicissitude of human\r\nthings does change from the most glorious and magnificent to the most\r\ndeformed and confused. We next went into St. Sebastian's Church, which\r\nhas a handsome front: then we passed by the place where Romulus and Remus\r\nwere taken up by Faustulus, the Forum Romanum, and so by the edge of the\r\nMons Palatinus; where we saw the ruins of Pompey's house, and the Church\r\nof St. Anacletus; and so into the Circus Maximus, heretofore capable of\r\ncontaining a hundred and sixty thousand spectators, but now all one\r\nentire heap of rubbish, part of it converted into a garden of pot herbs.\r\nWe concluded this evening with hearing the rare voices and music at the\r\nChiesa Nova.\r\n\r\n21st November, 1644. I was carried to see a great virtuoso, Cavaliéro\r\nPozzo, who showed us a rare collection of all kind of antiquities, and a\r\nchoice library, over which are the effigies of most of our late men of\r\npolite literature. He had a great collection of the antique\r\nbasso-relievos about Rome, which this curious man had caused to be\r\ndesigned in several folios: many fine medals; the stone which Pliny calls\r\nEnhydros; it had plainly in it the quantity of half a spoonful of water,\r\nof a yellow pebble color, of the bigness of a walnut. A stone paler than\r\nan amethyst, which yet he affirmed to be the true carbuncle, and harder\r\nthan a diamond; it was set in a ring, without foil, or anything at the\r\nbottom, so as it was transparent, of a greenish yellow, more lustrous\r\nthan a diamond. He had very pretty things painted on crimson velvet,\r\ndesigned in black, and shaded and heightened with white, set in frames;\r\nalso a number of choice designs and drawings.\r\n\r\nHence we walked to the Suburra and Ærarium Saturni, where yet remain some\r\nruins and an inscription. From thence to St. Pietro _in vinculis_, one of\r\nthe seven churches on the Esquiline, an old and much-frequented place of\r\ngreat devotion for the relics there, especially the bodies of the seven\r\nMaccabean brethren, which lie under the altar. On the wall is a St.\r\nSebastian, of mosaic, after the Greek manner: but what I chiefly regarded\r\nwas, that noble sepulchre of Pope Julius II., the work of M. Angelo; with\r\nthat never-sufficiently-to-be-admired statue of Moses, in white marble,\r\nand those of Vita Contemplativa and Activa, by the same incomparable\r\nhand. To this church belongs a monastery, in the court of whose cloisters\r\ngrow two tall and very stately palm trees. Behind these, we walked a turn\r\namong the Baths of Titus, admiring the strange and prodigious receptacles\r\nfor water, which the vulgar call the Setti Sali, now all in heaps.\r\n\r\n22d November, 1644. Was the solemn and greatest ceremony of all the State\r\nEcclesiastical, viz, the procession of the Pope (Innocent X.) to St. John\r\ndi Laterano, which, standing on the steps of Ara Celi, near the Capitol,\r\nI saw pass in this manner:--First went a guard of Switzers to make way,\r\nand divers of the avant guard of horse carrying lances. Next followed\r\nthose who carried the robes of the Cardinals, two and two; then the\r\nCardinal's mace bearers; the caudatari, on mules; the masters of their\r\nhorse; the Pope's barber, tailor, baker, gardener, and other domestic\r\nofficers, all on horseback, in rich liveries; the squires belonging to\r\nthe Guard; five men in rich liveries led five noble Neapolitan horses,\r\nwhite as snow, covered to the ground with trappings richly embroidered;\r\nwhich is a service paid by the King of Spain for the kingdoms of Naples\r\nand Sicily, pretended feudatories to the Pope; three mules of exquisite\r\nbeauty and price, trapped in crimson velvet; next followed three rich\r\nlitters with mules, the litters empty; the master of the horse alone,\r\nwith his squires; five trumpeters; the _armerieri estra muros_; the\r\nfiscal and consistorial advocates; _capellani_, _camerieri de honore_,\r\n_cubiculari_ and chamberlains, called _secreti_.\r\n\r\nThen followed four other _camerieri_ with four caps of the\r\ndignity-pontifical, which were Cardinals' hats carried on staves; four\r\ntrumpets; after them a number of noble Romans and gentlemen of quality,\r\nvery rich, and followed by innumerable _staffiéri_ and pages; the\r\nsecretaries of the _chancellaria_, _abbreviatori-accoliti_ in their long\r\nrobes, and on mules; _auditori di rota_; the dean of the _rôti_ and\r\nmaster of the sacred palace, on mules, with grave but rich footclothes,\r\nand in flat episcopal hats; then went more of the Roman and other\r\nnobility and courtiers, with divers pages in most rich liveries on\r\nhorseback; fourteen drums belonging to the Capitol; the marshals with\r\ntheir staves; the two syndics; the conservators of the city, in robes of\r\ncrimson damask; the knight-gonfalonier and prior of the R. R., in velvet\r\ntoques; six of his Holiness's mace bearers; then the captain, or\r\ngovernor, of the Castle of St. Angelo, upon a brave prancer; the governor\r\nof the city; on both sides of these two long ranks of Switzers, the\r\nmasters of the ceremonies; the cross bearer on horseback, with two\r\npriests at each hand on foot; pages, footmen, and guards, in abundance.\r\nThen came the Pope himself, carried in a litter, or rather open chair, of\r\ncrimson velvet, richly embroidered, and borne by two stately mules; as he\r\nwent he held up two fingers, blessing the multitude who were on their\r\nknees, or looking out of their windows and houses, with loud _vivas_ and\r\nacclamations of felicity to their new Prince. This chair was followed by\r\nthe master of his chamber, cup bearer, secretary, and physician; then\r\ncame the Cardinal-Bishops, Cardinal-Priests, Cardinal-Deacons,\r\nPatriarchs, Archbishops, and Bishops, all in their several and distinct\r\nhabits, some in red, others in green flat hats with tassels, all on\r\ngallant mules richly trapped with velvet, and led by their servants in\r\ngreat state and multitudes; after them, the apostolical protonotary,\r\nauditor, treasurer, and referendaries; lastly, the trumpets of the rear\r\nguard, two pages of arms in helmets with feathers, and carrying lances;\r\ntwo captains; the pontifical standard of the Church; the two _alfieri_,\r\nor cornets, of the Pope's light horse, who all followed in armor and\r\ncarrying lances; which, with innumerable rich coaches, litters, and\r\npeople, made up the procession. What they did at St. John di Laterano, I\r\ncould not see, by reason of the prodigious crowd; so I spent most of the\r\nday in viewing the two triumphal arches which had been purposely erected\r\na few days before, and till now covered; the one by the Duke of Parma, in\r\nthe Foro Romano, the other by the Jews in the Capitol, with flattering\r\ninscriptions. They were of excellent architecture, decorated with statues\r\nand abundance of ornaments proper for the occasion, since they were but\r\ntemporary, and made up of boards, cloth, etc., painted and framed on the\r\nsudden, but as to outward appearance, solid and very stately. The night\r\nended with fireworks. What I saw was that which was built before the\r\nSpanish Ambassador's house, in the Piazza del Trinita, and another,\r\nbefore that of the French. The first appeared to be a mighty rock,\r\nbearing the Pope's Arms, a dragon, and divers figures, which being set on\r\nfire by one who flung a rocket at it, kindled immediately, yet preserving\r\nthe figure both of the rock and statues a very long time; insomuch as it\r\nwas deemed ten thousand reports of squibs and crackers spent themselves\r\nin order. That before the French Ambassador's Palace was a Diana drawn\r\nin a chariot by her dogs, with abundance of other figures as large as the\r\nlife, which played with fire in the same manner. In the meantime, the\r\nwindows of the whole city were set with tapers put into lanterns, or\r\nsconces, of several colored oiled paper, that the wind might not annoy\r\nthem; this rendered a most glorious show. Besides these, there were at\r\nleast twenty other fireworks of vast charge and rare art for their\r\ninvention before divers Ambassadors, Princes, and Cardinals' Palaces,\r\nespecially that on the Castle of St. Angelo, being a pyramid of lights,\r\nof great height, fastened to the ropes and cables which support the\r\nstandard pole. The streets were this night as light as day, full of\r\nbonfires, cannon roaring, music playing, fountains running wine, in all\r\nexcess of joy and triumph.\r\n\r\n23d November, 1644. I went to the Jesuits' College again, the front\r\nwhereof gives place to few for its architecture, most of its ornaments\r\nbeing of rich marble. It has within a noble portico and court, sustained\r\nby stately columns, as is the corridor over the portico, at the sides of\r\nwhich are the schools for arts and sciences, which are here taught as at\r\nthe University. Here I heard Father Athanasius Kircher upon a part of\r\nEuclid, which he expounded. To this joins a glorious and ample church for\r\nthe students; a second is not fully finished; and there are two noble\r\nlibraries, where I was showed that famous wit and historian, Famianus\r\nStrada. Hence we went to the house of Hippolito Vitellesco (afterward\r\nbibliothecary of the Vatican library), who showed us one of the best\r\ncollections of statues in Rome, to which he frequently talks as if they\r\nwere living, pronouncing now and then orations, sentences, and verses,\r\nsometimes kissing and embracing them. He has a head of Brutus scarred in\r\nthe face by order of the Senate for killing Julius; this is much\r\nesteemed. Also a Minerva, and others of great value. This gentleman not\r\nlong since purchased land in the kingdom of Naples, in hope, by digging\r\nthe ground, to find more statues; which it seems so far succeeded, as to\r\nbe much more worth than the purchase. We spent the evening at the Chiesa\r\nNova, where was excellent music; but, before that began, the courteous\r\nfathers led me into a nobly furnished library, contiguous to their most\r\nbeautiful convent.\r\n\r\n28th November, 1644. I went to see the garden and house of the\r\nAldobrandini, now Cardinal Borghese's. This palace is, for architecture,\r\nmagnificence, pomp, and state, one of the most considerable about the\r\ncity. It has four fronts, and a noble piazza before it. Within the\r\ncourts, under arches supported by marble columns, are many excellent\r\nstatues. Ascending the stairs, there is a rare figure of Diana, of white\r\nmarble. The St. Sebastian and Hermaphrodite are of stupendous art. For\r\npaintings, our Savior's Head, by Correggio; several pieces of Raphael,\r\nsome of which are small; some of Bassano Veronese; the Leda, and two\r\nadmirable Venuses, are of Titian's pencil; so is the Psyche and Cupid;\r\nthe head of St. John, borne by Herodias; two heads of Albert Durer, very\r\nexquisite. We were shown here a fine cabinet and tables of Florence work\r\nin stone. In the gardens are many fine fountains, the walls covered with\r\ncitron trees, which, being rarely spread, invest the stone work entirely;\r\nand, toward the street, at a back gate, the port is so handsomely clothed\r\nwith ivy as much pleased me. About this palace are many noble antique\r\nbassi-relievi: two especially are placed on the ground, representing\r\narmor, and other military furniture of the Romans; beside these, stand\r\nabout the garden numerous rare statues, altars, and urns. Above all for\r\nantiquity and curiosity (as being the only rarity of that nature now\r\nknown to remain) is that piece of old Roman painting representing the\r\nRoman _Sponsalia_, or celebration of their marriage, judged to be 1,400\r\nyears old, yet are the colors very lively, and the design very entire,\r\nthough found deep in the ground. For this morsel of painting's sake only,\r\nit is said the Borghesi purchased the house, because this being on a wall\r\nin a kind of banqueting house in the garden, could not be removed, but\r\npasses with the inheritance.\r\n\r\n29th November, 1644. I a second time visited the Medicean Palace, being\r\nnear my lodging, the more exactly to have a view of the noble collections\r\nthat adorn it, especially the bassi-relievi and antique friezes inserted\r\nabout the stone work of the house. The Saturn, of metal, standing in the\r\nportico, is a rare piece; so is the Jupiter and Apollo, in the hall. We\r\nwere now led into those rooms above we could not see before, full of\r\nincomparable statues and antiquities; above all, and haply preferable to\r\nany in the world, are the Two Wrestlers, for the inextricable mixture\r\nwith each other's arms and legs is stupendous. In the great chamber is\r\nthe Gladiator, whetting a knife; but the Venus is without parallel, being\r\nthe masterpiece of one whose name you see graven under it in old Greek\r\ncharacters; nothing in sculpture ever approached this miracle of art. To\r\nthis add Marcius, Ganymede, a little Apollo playing on a pipe; some\r\nrelievi incrusted on the palace-walls; and an antique _vas_ of marble,\r\nnear six feet high. Among the pictures may be mentioned the Magdalen and\r\nSt. Peter, weeping. I pass over the cabinets and tables of _pietra\r\ncommessa_, being the proper invention of the Florentines. In one of the\r\nchambers is a whimsical chair, which folded into so many varieties, as to\r\nturn into a bed, a bolster, a table, or a couch. I had another walk in\r\nthe garden, where are two huge vases, or baths of stone.\r\n\r\nI went further up the hill to the Pope's Palaces at Monte Cavallo, where\r\nI now saw the garden more exactly, and found it to be one of the most\r\nmagnificent and pleasant in Rome. I am told the gardener is annually\r\nallowed 2,000 _scudi_ for the keeping of it. Here I observed hedges of\r\nmyrtle above a man's height; others of laurel, oranges, nay, of ivy and\r\njuniper; the close walks, and rustic grotto; a crypt, of which the laver,\r\nor basin, is of one vast, entire, antique porphyry, and below this flows\r\na plentiful cascade; the steps of the grotto and the roofs being of rich\r\nMosaic. Here are hydraulic organs, a fish pond, and an ample bath. From\r\nhence, we went to taste some rare Greco; and so home.\r\n\r\nBeing now pretty weary of continual walking, I kept within, for the most\r\npart, till the 6th of December; and, during this time, I entertained one\r\nSignor Alessandro, who gave me some lessons on the theorbo.\r\n\r\nThe next excursion was over the Tiber, which I crossed in a ferry-boat,\r\nto see the Palazzo di Ghisi, standing in Transtevere, fairly built, but\r\nfamous only for the painting _á fresco_ on the _volto_ of the portico\r\ntoward the garden; the story is the Amours of Cupid and Psyche, by the\r\nhand of the celebrated Raphael d'Urbino. Here you always see painters\r\ndesigning and copying after it, being esteemed one of the rarest pieces\r\nof that art in the world; and with great reason. I must not omit that\r\nincomparable table of Galatea (as I remember), so carefully preserved in\r\nthe cupboard at one of the ends of this walk, to protect it from the air,\r\nbeing a most lively painting. There are likewise excellent things of\r\nBaldassare, and others.\r\n\r\nThence we went to the noble house of the Duke of Bracciano, fairly built,\r\nwith a stately court and fountain.\r\n\r\nNext, we walked to St. Mary's Church, where was the _Taberna Meritoria_,\r\nwhere the old Roman soldiers received their triumphal garland, which they\r\never after wore. The high altar is very fair, adorned with columns of\r\nporphyry: here is also some mosaic work about the choir, and the\r\nAssumption is an esteemed piece. It is said that this church was the\r\nfirst that was dedicated to the Virgin at Rome. In the opposite piazza is\r\na very sumptuous fountain.\r\n\r\n12th December, 1644. I went again to St. Peter's to see the chapels,\r\nchurches, and grots under the whole church (like our St. Faith's under\r\nPaul's), in which lie interred a multitude of Saints, Martyrs, and Popes;\r\namong them our countryman, Adrian IV., (Nicholas Brekespere) in a chest\r\nof porphyry; Sir J. Chrysostom; Petronella; the heads of St. James minor,\r\nSt. Luke, St. Sebastian, and our Thomas à Becket; a shoulder of St.\r\nChristopher; an arm of Joseph of Arimathea; Longinus; besides 134 more\r\nbishops, soldiers, princes, scholars, cardinals, kings, emperors, their\r\nwives; too long to particularize.\r\n\r\nHence we walked into the cemetery, called Campo Santo, the earth\r\nconsisting of several ship-loads of mold, transported from Jerusalem,\r\nwhich consumes a carcass in twenty-four hours. To this joins that rare\r\nhospital, where once was Nero's circus; the next to this is the\r\nInquisition-house and prison, the inside whereof, I thank God, I was not\r\ncurious to see. To this joins His Holiness's Horseguards.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas-eve, I went not to bed, being desirous of seeing the many\r\nextraordinary ceremonies performed then in their churches, at midnight\r\nmasses and sermons. I walked from church to church the whole night in\r\nadmiration at the multitude of scenes and pageantry which the friars had\r\nwith much industry and craft set out, to catch the devout women and\r\nsuperstitious sort of people, who never parted without dropping some\r\nmoney into a vessel set on purpose; but especially observable was the\r\npuppetry in the Church of the Minerva, representing the Nativity. I\r\nthence went and heard a sermon at the Apollinare; by which time it was\r\nmorning. On Christmas-day his Holiness sang mass, the artillery of St.\r\nAngelo went off, and all this day was exposed the cradle of our Lord.\r\n\r\n29th December, 1644. We were invited by the English Jesuits to dinner,\r\nbeing their great feast of Thomas [à Becket] of Canterbury. We dined in\r\ntheir common refectory, and afterward saw an Italian comedy acted by\r\ntheir alumni before the Cardinals.\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1645. We saw pass the new officers of the people of Rome;\r\nespecially, for their noble habits were most conspicuous, the three\r\nConsuls, now called Conservators, who take their places in the Capitol,\r\nhaving been sworn the day before between the hands of the Pope. We ended\r\nthe day with the rare music at the Chiesa Nova.\r\n\r\n6th January, 1645. Was the ceremony of our Savior's baptism in the Church\r\nof St. Athanasius, and at Ara Celi was a great procession, del Bambino,\r\nas they call it, where were all the magistrates, and a wonderful\r\nconcourse of people.\r\n\r\n7th January, 1645. A sermon was preached to the Jews, at Ponte Sisto, who\r\nare constrained to sit till the hour is done; but it is with so much\r\nmalice in their countenances, spitting, humming, coughing, and motion,\r\nthat it is almost impossible they should hear a word from the preacher. A\r\nconversion is very rare.\r\n\r\n14th January, 1645. The heads of St. Peter and St. Paul are exposed at\r\nSt. John Laterano.\r\n\r\n15th January, 1645. The zitelle, or young wenches, which are to have\r\nportions given them by the Pope, being poor, and to marry them, walked in\r\nprocession to St. Peter's, where the Veronica was shown.\r\n\r\nI went to the Ghetto, where the Jews dwell as in a suburb by themselves;\r\nbeing invited by a Jew of my acquaintance to see a circumcision. I passed\r\nby the Piazza Judea, where their seraglio begins; for, being environed\r\nwith walls, they are locked up every night. In this place remains yet\r\npart of a stately fabric, which my Jew told me had been a palace of\r\ntheirs for the ambassador of their nation, when their country was subject\r\nto the Romans. Being led through the Synagogue into a private house, I\r\nfound a world of people in a chamber: by and by came an old man, who\r\nprepared and laid in order divers instruments brought by a little child\r\nof about seven years old in a box. These the man laid in a silver basin;\r\nthe knife was much like a short razor to shut into the half. Then they\r\nburnt some incense in a censer, which perfumed the room all the while the\r\nceremony was performing. In the basin was a little cap made of white\r\npaper like a capuchin's hood, not bigger than the finger: also a paper of\r\na red astringent powder, I suppose of bole; a small instrument of silver,\r\ncleft in the middle at one end, to take up the prepuce withal; a fine\r\nlinen cloth wrapped up. These being all in order, the women brought the\r\ninfant swaddled, out of another chamber, and delivered it to the Rabbi,\r\nwho carried and presented it before an altar, or cupboard, dressed up, on\r\nwhich lay the five Books of Moses, and the Commandments, a little\r\nunrolled. Before this, with profound reverence, and mumbling a few words,\r\nhe waved the child to and fro awhile; then he delivered it to another\r\nRabbi, who sat all this time upon a table. While the ceremony was\r\nperforming, all the company fell singing a Hebrew hymn, in a barbarous\r\ntone, waving themselves to and fro; a ceremony they observe in all their\r\ndevotions.--The Jews in Rome all wear yellow hats, live only upon brokage\r\nand usury, very poor and despicable, beyond what they are in other\r\nterritories of Princes where they are permitted.\r\n\r\n18th January, 1645. I went to see the Pope's Palace, the Vatican, where\r\nhe for the most part keeps his Court. It was first built by Pope\r\nSymmachus, and since augmented to a vast pile of building by his\r\nsuccessors. That part of it added by Sextus V. is most magnificent. This\r\nleads us into divers terraces arched _sub dio_, painted by Raphael with\r\nthe histories of the Bible, so esteemed, that artists come from all parts\r\nof Europe to make their studies from these designs. The foliage and\r\ngrotesque about some of the compartments are admirable. In another room\r\nare represented at large, maps and plots of most countries in the world,\r\nin vast tables, with brief descriptions. The stairs which ascend out of\r\nSt. Peter's portico into the first hall, are rarely contrived for ease;\r\nthese lead into the hall of Gregory XIII., the walls whereof, half way to\r\nthe roof, are incrusted with most precious marbles of various colors and\r\nworks. So is also the pavement inlaid work; but what exceeds description\r\nis, the _volta_, or roof itself, which is so exquisitely painted, that it\r\nis almost impossible for the skillfullest eyes to discern whether it be\r\nthe work of the pencil upon a flat, or of a tool cut deep in stone. The\r\n_Rota dentata_, in this admirable perspective, on the left hand as one\r\ngoes out, the _Setella_, etc., are things of art incomparable. Certainly\r\nthis is one of the most superb and royal apartments in the world, much\r\ntoo beautiful for a guard of gigantic Switzers, who do nothing but drink\r\nand play at cards in it. Going up these stairs is a painting of St.\r\nPeter, walking on the sea toward our Savior.\r\n\r\nOut of this I went into another hall, just before the chapel, called the\r\nSàla del Conclave, full of admirable paintings; among others is the\r\nAssassination of Coligni, the great [Protestant] French Admiral, murdered\r\nby the Duke of Guise, in the Parisian massacre at the nuptials of Henry\r\nIV, with Queen Margaret; under it is written, \"_Coligni et sociorum\r\ncædes_:\" on the other side, \"_Rex Coligi necem probat_.\"\r\n\r\nThere is another very large picture, under which is inscribed:\r\n\r\n    \"_Alexander Papa III., Frederici Primi Imperatoris iram et impetum\r\n    fugiens, abdidit se Venetijs; cognitum et à senatu perhonorificè\r\n    susceptum, Othone Imperatoris filio navali prælio victo captoq;\r\n    Fredericus, pace facta, supplex adorat; fidem et obedientiam\r\n    pollicitus. Ita Pontifici sua dignitas Venet. Reip. beneficio\r\n    restituta MCLXXVIII._\"[24]\r\n\r\n        [Footnote 24: Pope Alexander III., flying from the wrath and\r\n        violence of the Emperor Frederick I., took shelter at Venice,\r\n        where he was acknowledged, and most honorably received by the\r\n        Senate. The Emperor's son, Otho, being conquered and taken in\r\n        a naval battle, the Emperor, having made peace, became a\r\n        suppliant to the Pope, promising fealty and obedience. Thus\r\n        his dignity was restored to the Pontiff, by the aid of the\r\n        Republic of Venice, MCLXXVIII.]\r\n\r\nThis inscription I the rather took notice of, because Urban VIII. had\r\ncaused it to be blotted out during the difference between him and that\r\nState; but it was now restored and refreshed by his successor, to the\r\ngreat honor of the Venetians. The Battle of Lepanto is another fair\r\npiece here.\r\n\r\nNow we came into the Pope's chapel, so much celebrated for the Last\r\nJudgment painted by M. Angelo Buonarotti. It is a painting in fresco,\r\nupon a dead wall at the upper end of the chapel, just over the high\r\naltar, of a vast design and miraculous fancy, considering the multitude\r\nof naked figures and variety of posture. The roof also is full of rare\r\nwork. Hence, we went into the _sacristia_ where were showed all the most\r\nprecious vestments, copes, and furniture of the chapel. One priestly\r\ncope, with the whole suite, had been sent from one of our English Henrys,\r\nand is shown for a great rarity. There were divers of the Pope's\r\npantoufles that are kissed on his foot, having rich jewels embroidered on\r\nthe instep, covered with crimson velvet; also his tiara, or triple crown,\r\ndivers miters, crosiers, etc., all bestudded with precious stones, gold,\r\nand pearl, to a very great value; a very large cross, carved (as they\r\naffirm) out of the holy wood itself; numerous utensils of crystal, gold,\r\nagate, amber, and other costly materials for the altar.\r\n\r\nWe then went into those chambers painted with the Histories of the\r\nburning of Rome, quenched by the procession of a Crucifix; the victory of\r\nConstantine over Maxentius; St. Peter's delivery out of Prison; all by\r\nJulio Romano, and are therefore called the Painters' Academy, because you\r\nalways find some young men or other designing from them: a civility which\r\nis not refused in Italy, where any rare pieces of the old and best\r\nmasters are extant, and which is the occasion of breeding up many\r\nexcellent men in that profession.\r\n\r\nThe Sala Clementina's Suffito is painted by Cherubin Alberti, with an\r\nample landscape of Paul Bril's.\r\n\r\nWe were then conducted into a new gallery, whose sides were painted with\r\nviews of the most famous places, towns, and territories in Italy, rarely\r\ndone, and upon the roof the chief Acts of the Roman Church since St.\r\nPeter's pretended See there. It is doubtless one of the most magnificent\r\ngalleries in Europe.--Out of this we came into the Consistory, a noble\r\nroom, the _volta_ painted in grotesque, as I remember. At the upper end,\r\nis an elevated throne and a baldachin, or canopy of state, for his\r\nHoliness, over it.\r\n\r\nFrom thence, through a very long gallery (longer, I think, than the\r\nFrench Kings at the Louvre), but only of bare walls, we were brought into\r\nthe Vatican Library. This passage was now full of poor people, to each of\r\nwhom, in his passage to St. Peter's, the Pope gave a _mezzo grosse_. I\r\nbelieve they were in number near 1,500 or 2,000 persons.\r\n\r\nThis library is the most nobly built, furnished, and beautified of any in\r\nthe world; ample, stately, light, and cheerful, looking into a most\r\npleasant garden. The walls and roof are painted, not with antiques and\r\ngrotesques, like our Bodleian at Oxford, but emblems, figures, diagrams,\r\nand the like learned inventions, found out by the wit and industry of\r\nfamous men, of which there are now whole volumes extant. There were\r\nlikewise the effigies of the most illustrious men of letters and fathers\r\nof the church, with divers noble statues, in white marble, at the\r\nentrance, viz, Hippolytus and Aristides. The General Councils are\r\npainted on the side walls. As to the ranging of the books, they are all\r\nshut up in presses of wainscot, and not exposed on shelves to the open\r\nair, nor are the most precious mixed among the more ordinary, which are\r\nshowed to the curious only; such are those two Virgils written on\r\nparchment, of more than a thousand years old; the like, a Terence; the\r\n\"Acts of the Apostles\" in golden capital letters; Petrarch's \"Epigrams,\"\r\nwritten with his own hand; also a Hebrew parchment, made up in the\r\nancient manner, from whence they were first called \"_Volumina_\", with the\r\nCornua; but what we English do much inquire after, the book which our\r\nHenry VIII. writ against Luther.[25]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: This very book, by one of those curious chances that\r\n    occasionally happen, found its way into England some forty years\r\n    ago, and was seen by the Editor of the early edition of this\r\n    \"Diary.\" It may be worth remarking that wherever, in the course of\r\n    it, the title of \"Defender of the Faith\" was subjoined to the name\r\n    of Henry, the Pope had drawn his pen through the title. The name of\r\n    the King occurred in his own handwriting both at the beginning and\r\n    end; and on the binding were the Royal Arms. Its possessor had\r\n    purchased it in Italy for a few shillings from an old bookstall.]\r\n\r\nThe largest room is 100 paces long; at the end is the gallery of printed\r\nbooks; then the gallery of the Duke of Urban's library, in which are MSS.\r\nof remarkable miniature, and divers Chinese, Mexican, Samaritan,\r\nAbyssinian, and other oriental books.\r\n\r\nIn another wing of the edifice, 200 paces long, were all the books taken\r\nfrom Heidelberg, of which the learned Gruter, and other great scholars,\r\nhad been keepers. These walls and _volte_ are painted with\r\nrepresentations of the machines invented by Domenico Fontana for erection\r\nof the obelisks; and the true design of Mahomet's sepulchre at Mecca.\r\n\r\nOut of this we went to see the Conclave, where, during a vacancy, the\r\nCardinals are shut up till they are agreed upon a new election; the whole\r\nmanner whereof was described to us.\r\n\r\nHence we went into the Pope's Armory, under the library. Over the door is\r\nthis inscription:\r\n\r\n    \"URBANUS VIII. LITTERIS ARMA, ARMA LITTERIS.\"\r\n\r\nI hardly believe any prince in Europe is able to show a more completely\r\nfurnished library of Mars, for the quality and quantity, which is 40,000\r\ncomplete for horse and foot, and neatly kept. Out of this we passed again\r\nby the long gallery, and at the lower end of it down a very large pair of\r\nstairs, round, without any steps as usually, but descending with an\r\nevenness so ample and easy, that a horse-litter, or coach, may with ease\r\nbe drawn up; the sides of the vacuity are set with columns: those at\r\nAmboise, on the Loire, in France, are something of this invention, but\r\nnothing so spruce. By these, we descended into the Vatican gardens,\r\ncalled Belvedere, where entering first into a kind of court, we were\r\nshowed those incomparable statues (so famed by Pliny and others) of\r\nLaocoon with his three sons embraced by a huge serpent, all of one entire\r\nParian stone, very white and perfect, somewhat bigger than the life, the\r\nwork of those three celebrated sculptors, Agesandrus, Polydorus, and\r\nArtemidorus, Rhodians; it was found among the ruins of Titus's baths, and\r\nplaced here. Pliny says this statue is to be esteemed before all pictures\r\nand statues in the world; and I am of his opinion, for I never beheld\r\nanything of art approach it. Here are also those two famous images of\r\nNilus with the children playing about him, and that of Tiber; Romulus and\r\nRemus with the Wolf; the dying Cleopatra; the Venus and Cupid, rare\r\npieces; the Mercury; Cybel; Hercules; Apollo; Antinous: most of which\r\nare, for defense against the weather, shut up in niches with wainscot\r\ndoors. We were likewise showed the relics of the Hadrian Moles, viz, the\r\nPine, a vast piece of metal which stood on the summit of that mausoleum;\r\nalso a peacock of copper, supposed to have been part of Scipio's\r\nmonument.\r\n\r\nIn the garden without this (which contains a vast circuit of ground) are\r\nmany stately fountains, especially two casting water into antique lavers,\r\nbrought from Titus's baths; some fair grots and water-works, that noble\r\ncascade where the ship dances, with divers other pleasant inventions,\r\nwalks, terraces, meanders, fruit trees, and a most goodly prospect over\r\nthe greatest part of the city. One fountain under the gate I must not\r\nomit, consisting of three jettos of water gushing out of the mouths or\r\nproboscides of bees (the arms of the late Pope), because of the\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n    \"_Quid miraris Apem, quae mel de floribus haurit?\r\n    Si tibi mellitam gutture fundit aquam._\"\r\n\r\n23d January, 1645. We went without the walls of the city to visit St.\r\nPaul's, to which place it is said the Apostle bore his own head after\r\nNero had caused it to be cut off. The church was founded by the great\r\nConstantine; the main roof is supported by 100 vast columns of marble,\r\nand the Mosaic work of the great arch is wrought with a very ancient\r\nstory A^o 440; as is likewise that of the _facciata_. The gates are\r\nbrass, made at Constantinopole in 1070, as you may read by those Greek\r\nverses engraven on them. The church is near 500 feet long and 258 in\r\nbreadth, and has five great aisles joined to it, on the basis of one of\r\nwhose columns is this odd title: \"_Fl. Eugenius Asellus C. C. Præf. Urbis\r\nV. S. I. reparavit_.\" Here they showed us that miraculous Crucifix which\r\nthey say spake to St. Bridget: and, just before the Ciborio, stand two\r\nexcellent statues. Here are buried part of the bodies of St. Paul and St.\r\nPeter. The pavement is richly interwoven with precious Oriental marbles\r\nabout the high altar, where are also four excellent paintings, whereof\r\none, representing the stoning of St. Stephen, is by the hand of a\r\nBolognian lady, named Lavinia. The tabernacle on this altar is of\r\nexcellent architecture, and the pictures in the Chapel del Sacramento\r\nare of Lanfranco. Divers other relics there be also in this venerable\r\nchurch, as a part of St. Anna; the head of the Woman of Samaria; the\r\nchain which bound St. Paul, and the _eculeus_ used in tormenting the\r\nprimitive Christians. The church stands in the Via Ositensis, about a\r\nmile from the walls of the city, separated from many buildings near it\r\nexcept the Trie Fontana, to which (leaving our coach) we walked, going\r\nover the mountain or little rising, upon which story says a hundred\r\nseventy and four thousand Christians had been martyred by Maximianus,\r\nDioclesian, and other bloody tyrants. On this stand St. Vincent's and St.\r\nAnastasius; likewise the Church of St. Maria Scala del Cielo, in whose\r\nTribuna is a very fair Mosaic work. The Church of the Trie Fontana (as\r\nthey are called) is perfectly well built, though but small (whereas that\r\nof St. Paul is but Gothic), having a noble cupola in the middle; in this\r\nthey show the pillar to which St. Paul was bound, when his head was cut\r\noff, and from whence it made three prodigious leaps, where there\r\nimmediately broke out the three remaining fountains, which give\r\ndenomination to this church. The waters are reported to be medicinal:\r\nover each is erected an altar and a chained ladle, for better tasting of\r\nthe waters. That most excellent picture of St. Peter's Crucifixion is of\r\nGuido.\r\n\r\n25th January, 1645. I went again to the Palazzo Farnese, to see some\r\ncertain statues and antiquities which, by reason of the Major-Domo not\r\nbeing within, I could not formerly obtain. In the hall stands that\r\ntriumphant Colosse of one of the family, upon three figures, a modern,\r\nbut rare piece. About it stood some Gladiators; and, at the entrance into\r\none of the first chambers, are two cumbent figures of AGE and YOUTH,\r\nbrought hither from St. Peter's to make room for the Longinus under the\r\ncupola. Here was the statue of a ram running at a man on horseback, a\r\nmost incomparable expression of Fury, cut in stone; and a table of\r\n_pietra-commessa_, very curious. The next chamber was all painted _a\r\nfresco_, by a rare hand, as was the carving in wood of the ceiling,\r\nwhich, as I remember, was in cedar, as the Italian mode is, and not poor\r\nplaster, as ours are; some of them most richly gilt. In a third room,\r\nstood the famous Venus, and the child Hercules strangling a serpent, of\r\nCorinthian brass, antique, on a very curious basso-relievo; the\r\nsacrifice to Priapus; the Egyptian Isis, in the hard, black ophite stone,\r\ntaken out of the Pantheon, greatly celebrated by the antiquaries:\r\nlikewise two tables of brass, containing divers old Roman laws. At\r\nanother side of this chamber, was the statue of a wounded Amazon falling\r\nfrom her horse, worthy the name of the excellent sculptor, whoever the\r\nartist was. Near this was a bass-relievo of a Bacchanalia, with a most\r\ncurious Silenus. The fourth room was totally environed with statues;\r\nespecially observable was that so renowned piece of a Venus looking\r\nbackward over her shoulder, and divers other naked figures, by the old\r\nGreek masters. Over the doors are two Venuses, one of them looking on her\r\nface in a glass, by M. Angelo; the other is painted by Caracci. I never\r\nsaw finer faces, especially that under the mask, whose beauty and art are\r\nnot to be described by words. The next chamber is also full of statues;\r\nmost of them the heads of Philosophers, very antique. One of the Cæsars\r\nand another of Hannibal cost 1,200 crowns. Now I had a second view of\r\nthat never-to-be-sufficiently-admired gallery, painted in deep relievo,\r\nthe work of ten years' study, for a trifling reward. In the wardrobe\r\nabove they showed us fine wrought plate, porcelain, mazers of beaten and\r\nsolid gold, set with diamonds, rubies, and emeralds; a treasure,\r\nespecially the workmanship considered, of inestimable value. This is all\r\nthe Duke of Parma's. Nothing seemed to be more curious and rare in its\r\nkind than the complete service of the purest crystal, for the altar of\r\nthe chapel, the very bell, cover of a book, sprinkler, etc., were all of\r\nthe rock, incomparably sculptured, with the holy story in deep Levati;\r\nthus was also wrought the crucifix, chalice, vases, flowerpots, the\r\nlargest and purest crystal that my eyes ever beheld. Truly I looked on\r\nthis as one of the greatest curiosities I had seen in Rome. In another\r\npart were presses furnished with antique arms, German clocks, perpetual\r\nmotions, watches, and curiosities of Indian works. A very ancient picture\r\nof Pope Eugenius; a St. Bernard; and a head of marble found long since,\r\nsupposed to be a true portrait of our Blessed Savior's face.\r\n\r\nHence, we went to see Dr. Gibbs, a famous poet and countryman of ours,\r\nwho had some intendency in an hospital built on the Via Triumphalis,\r\ncalled Christ's Hospital, which he showed us. The Infirmatory, where the\r\nsick lay, was paved with various colored marbles, and the walls hung with\r\nnoble pieces; the beds are very fair; in the middle is a stately cupola,\r\nunder which is an altar decked with divers marble statues, all in sight\r\nof the sick, who may both see and hear mass, as they lie in their beds.\r\nThe organs are very fine, and frequently played on to recreate the people\r\nin pain. To this joins an apartment destined for the orphans; and there\r\nis a school: the children wear blue, like ours in London, at an hospital\r\nof the same appellation. Here are forty nurses, who give suck to such\r\nchildren as are accidentally found exposed and abandoned. In another\r\nquarter, are children of a bigger growth, 450 in number, who are taught\r\nletters. In another, 500 girls, under the tuition of divers religious\r\nmatrons, in a monastery, as it were, by itself. I was assured there were\r\nat least 2,000 more maintained in other places. I think one apartment had\r\nin it near 1,000 beds; these are in a very long room, having an inner\r\npassage for those who attend, with as much care, sweetness, and\r\nconveniency as can be imagined, the Italians being generally very neat.\r\nUnder the portico, the sick may walk out and take the air. Opposite to\r\nthis, are other chambers for such as are sick of maladies of a more rare\r\nand difficult cure, and they have rooms apart. At the end of the long\r\ncorridor is an apothecary's shop, fair and very well stored; near which\r\nare chambers for persons of better quality, who are yet necessitous.\r\nWhatever the poor bring is, at their coming in, delivered to a treasurer,\r\nwho makes an inventory, and is accountable to them, or their\r\nrepresentatives if they die.\r\n\r\nTo this building joins the house of the commendator, who, with his\r\nofficers attending the sick, make up ninety persons; besides a convent\r\nand an ample church for the friars and priests who daily attend. The\r\nchurch is extremely neat, and the _sacristia_ is very rich. Indeed it is\r\naltogether one of the most pious and worthy foundations I ever saw. Nor\r\nis the benefit small which divers young physicians and chirurgeons reap\r\nby the experience they learn here among the sick, to whom those students\r\nhave free access. Hence, we ascended a very steep hill, near the Port St.\r\nPancratio, to that stately fountain called Acqua Paula, being the\r\naqueduct which Augustus had brought to Rome, now re-edified by Paulus V.;\r\na rare piece of architecture, and which serves the city after a journey\r\nof thirty-five miles, here pouring itself into divers ample lavers, out\r\nof the mouths of swans and dragons, the arms of this Pope. Situate on a\r\nvery high mount, it makes a most glorious show to the city, especially\r\nwhen the sun darts on the water as it gusheth out. The inscriptions on it\r\nare:\r\n\r\n    \"_Paulus V. Romanus Pontifex Opt. Max. Aquæductus ab Augusto Cæsare\r\n    extructos, ævi longinquâ vetustate collapsos, in ampliorem formam\r\n    restituit anno salutis M.D.CIX. Pont. V._\"\r\n\r\nAnd toward the fields:\r\n\r\n    \"_Paulus V. Rom. Pontifex Optimus Maximus, priori ductu longissimi\r\n    temporis injuriâ penè diruto, sublimiorem._\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    [One or more leaves are here wanting in Evelyn's MS., descriptive of\r\n    other parts of Rome, and of his leaving the city.]\r\n\r\nThence to Velletri, a town heretofore of the Volsci, where is a public\r\nand fair statue of P. Urban VIII., in brass, and a stately fountain in\r\nthe street. Here we lay and drank excellent wine.\r\n\r\n28th January, 1645. We dined at Sermonetta, descending all this morning\r\ndown a stony mountain, unpleasant, yet full of olive trees; and, anon,\r\npass a tower built on a rock, kept by a small guard against the banditti\r\nwho infest those parts, daily robbing and killing passengers, as my Lord\r\nBanbury and his company found to their cost a little before. To this\r\nguard we gave some money, and so were suffered to pass, which was still\r\non the Appian to the _Tres Tabernæ_ (whither the brethren came from Rome\r\nto meet St. Paul, Acts, c. 28); the ruins whereof are yet very fair,\r\nresembling the remainder of some considerable edifice, as may be judged\r\nby the vast stones and fairness of the arched work. The country\r\nenvironing this passage is hilly, but rich; on the right hand stretches\r\nan ample plain, being the _Pomptini Campi_. We reposed this night at\r\nPiperno, in the posthouse without the town; and here I was extremely\r\ntroubled with a sore hand, which now began to fester, from a mischance at\r\nRome, upon my base, unlucky, stiff-necked, trotting, carrion mule; which\r\nare the most wretched beasts in the world. In this town was the poet\r\nVirgil's Camilla born.\r\n\r\nThe day following, we were fain to hire a strong convoy of about thirty\r\nfirelocks, to guard us through the cork woods (much infested with the\r\nbanditti) as far as Fossa Nuova, where was the Forum Appii, and now\r\nstands a church with a great monastery, the place where Thomas Aquinas\r\nboth studied and lies buried. Here we all alighted, and were most\r\ncourteously received by the Monks, who showed us many relics of their\r\nlearned Saint and at the high altar the print forsooth of the mule's hoof\r\nwhich he caused to kneel before the Host. The church is old, built after\r\nthe Gothic manner; but the place is very agreeably melancholy. After\r\nthis, pursuing the same noble [Appian] way (which we had before left a\r\nlittle), we found it to stretch from Capua to Rome itself, and afterward\r\nas far as Brundusium. It was built by that famous Consul, twenty-five\r\nfeet broad, every twelve feet something ascending for the ease and firmer\r\nfooting of horse and man; both the sides are also a little raised for\r\nthose who travel on foot. The whole is paved with a kind of beach-stone,\r\nand, as I said, ever and anon adorned with some old ruin, sepulchre, or\r\nbroken statue. In one of these monuments Pancirollus tells us that, in\r\nthe time of Paul III., there was found the body of a young lady, swimming\r\nin a kind of bath of precious oil, or liquor, fresh and entire as if she\r\nhad been living, neither her face discolored, nor her hair disordered; at\r\nher feet burnt a lamp, which suddenly expired at the opening of the\r\nvault; having flamed, as was computed, now 1,500 years, by the conjecture\r\nthat she was Tulliola, the daughter of Cicero, whose body was thus found,\r\nand as the inscription testified. We dined this day at Terracina,\r\nheretofore the famous Anxur, which stands upon a very eminent promontory,\r\nthe Circean by name. While meat was preparing, I went up into the town,\r\nand viewed the fair remainders of Jupiter's Temple, now converted into a\r\nchurch, adorned with most stately columns; its architecture has been\r\nexcellent, as may be deduced from the goodly cornices, moldings, and huge\r\nwhite marbles of which it is built. Before the portico stands a pillar\r\nthus inscribed:\r\n\r\n    \"_Inclyta Gothorum Regis monumenta vetusta\r\n          Anxuri hoc Oculos exposuere loco;_\"\r\n\r\nfor, it seems, Theodoric drained their marches.\r\n\r\nOn another more ancient:\r\n\r\n    \"_Imp. Cæsar Divi Nervæ Filius Nerva Trojanus Aug. Germanicus\r\n    Dacicus. Pontif. Max. Trib. Pop. xviii. Imp. vi. Cos. v. p. p.\r\n    xviii. Silices suâ pecuniâ stravit._\"\r\n\r\nMeaning doubtless, some part of the Via Appia. Then:\r\n\r\n    \"_Tit. Upio. Aug. optato Pontano Procuratori et Præfect.\r\n    Classis.--Ti. Julius. T. Fab. optatus, II. vir._\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FONDI]\r\n\r\nHere is likewise a Columna Milliaria, with something engraven on it, but\r\nI could not stay to consider it. Coming down again, I went toward the\r\nsea-side to contemplate that stupendous strange rock and promontory,\r\ncleft by hand, I suppose, for the better passage. Within this is the\r\nCircean Cave, which I went into a good way; it makes a dreadful noise, by\r\nreason of the roaring and impetuous waves continually assaulting the\r\nbeach, and that in an unusual manner. At the top, at an excessive height,\r\nstands an old and very great castle. We arrived this night at Fondi, a\r\nmost dangerous passage for robbing; and so we passed by Galba's villa,\r\nand anon entered the kingdom of Naples, where, at the gate, this epigraph\r\nsaluted us: \"_Hospes, hìc sunt fines Regni Neopolitani; si amicus\r\nadvenis, pacatè omnia invenies, et malis moribus pulsis, bonas leges_.\"\r\nThe Via Appia is here a noble prospect; having before considered how it\r\nwas carried through vast mountains of rocks for many miles, by most\r\nstupendous labor: here it is infinitely pleasant, beset with sepulchres\r\nand antiquities, full of sweet shrubs in the environing hedges. At Fondi,\r\nwe had oranges and citrons for nothing, the trees growing in every\r\ncorner, charged with fruit.\r\n\r\n29th January, 1645. We descried Mount Cæcubus, famous for the generous\r\nwine it heretofore produced, and so rode onward the Appian Way, beset\r\nwith myrtles, lentiscuses, bays, pomegranates, and whole groves of orange\r\ntrees, and most delicious shrubs, till we came to Formiana [Formiæ],\r\nwhere they showed us Cicero's tomb, standing in an olive grove, now a\r\nrude heap of stones without form or beauty; for here that incomparable\r\norator was murdered. I shall never forget how exceedingly I was\r\ndelighted with the sweetness of this passage, the sepulchre mixed among\r\nall sorts of verdure; besides being now come within sight of the noble\r\ncity, Cajeta [Gaieta], which gives a surprising prospect along the\r\nTyrrhene Sea, in manner of a theater: and here we beheld that strangely\r\ncleft rock, a frightful spectacle, which they say happened upon the\r\npassion of our Blessed Savior; but the haste of our procaccio did not\r\nsuffer us to dwell so long on these objects and the many antiquities of\r\nthis town as we desired.\r\n\r\nAt Formi, we saw Cicero's grot; dining at Mola, and passing Sinuessa,\r\nGarigliano (once the city Mintern), and beheld the ruins of that vast\r\namphitheater and aqueduct yet standing; the river Liris, which bounded\r\nthe old Latium, Falernus, or Mons Massacus, celebrated for its wine, now\r\nnamed Garo; and this night we lodged at a little village called St.\r\nAgatha, in the Falernian Fields, near to Aurunca and Sessa.\r\n\r\nThe next day, having passed [the river] Vulturnus, we come by the Torre\r\ndi Francolisi, where Hannibal, in danger from Fabius Maximus, escaped by\r\ndebauching his enemies; and so at last we entered the most pleasant\r\nplains of Campania, now called Terra di Lavoro; in very truth, I think,\r\nthe most fertile spot that ever the sun shone upon. Here we saw the\r\nslender ruins of the once mighty Capua, contending at once both with Rome\r\nand Carthage, for splendor and empire, now nothing but a heap of rubbish,\r\nexcept showing some vestige of its former magnificence in pieces of\r\ntemples, arches, theatres, columns, ports, vaults, colosses, etc.,\r\nconfounded together by the barbarous Goths and Longobards; there is,\r\nhowever, a new city, nearer to the road by two miles, fairly raised out\r\nof these heaps. The passage from this town to Naples (which is about ten\r\nor twelve English post miles) is as straight as a line, of great breadth,\r\nfuller of travelers than I remember any of our greatest and most\r\nfrequented roads near London; but, what is extremely pleasing, is the\r\ngreat fertility of the fields, planted with fruit trees, whose boles are\r\nserpented with excellent vines, and they so exuberant, that it is\r\ncommonly reported one vine will load five mules with its grapes. What\r\nadds much to the pleasure of the sight is, that the vines, climbing to\r\nthe summit of the trees, reach in festoons and fruitages from one tree to\r\nanother, planted at exact distances, forming a more delightful picture\r\nthan painting can describe. Here grow rice, canes for sugar, olives,\r\npomegranates, mulberries, citrons, oranges, figs, and other sorts of rare\r\nfruits. About the middle of the way is the town Aversa, whither came\r\nthree or four coaches to meet our lady travelers, of whom we now took\r\nleave, having been very merry by the way with them and the capitáno,\r\ntheir gallant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NAPLES]\r\n\r\n31st January, 1645. About noon we entered the city of Naples, alighting\r\nat the Three Kings, where we found the most plentiful fare all the time\r\nwe were in Naples. Provisions are wonderfully cheap; we seldom sat down\r\nto fewer than eighteen or twenty dishes of exquisite meat and fruits.\r\n\r\nThe morrow after our arrival, in the afternoon, we hired a coach to carry\r\nus about the town. First, we went to the castle of St. Elmo, built on a\r\nvery high rock, whence we had an entire prospect of the whole city, which\r\nlies in shape of a theatre upon the sea-brink, with all the circumjacent\r\nislands, as far as Capreæ, famous for the debauched recesses of Tiberius.\r\nThis fort is the bridle of the whole city, and was well stored and\r\ngarrisoned with native Spaniards. The strangeness of the precipice and\r\nrareness of the prospect of so many magnificent and stately palaces,\r\nchurches, and monasteries, with the Arsenal, the Mole, and Mount Vesuvius\r\nin the distance, all in full command of the eye, make it one of the\r\nrichest landscapes in the world.\r\n\r\nHence, we descended to another strong castle, called Il Castello Nuovo,\r\nwhich protects the shore; but they would by no entreaty permit us to go\r\nin; the outward defense seems to consist but in four towers, very high,\r\nand an exceeding deep graff, with thick walls. Opposite to this is the\r\ntower of St. Vincent, which is also very strong.\r\n\r\nThen we went to the very noble palace of the Viceroy, partly old, and\r\npart of a newer work; but we did not stay long here. Toward the evening,\r\nwe took the air upon the Mole, a street on the rampart, or bank, raised\r\nin the sea for security of their galleys in port, built as that of Genoa.\r\nHere I observed a rich fountain in the middle of the piazza, and adorned\r\nwith divers rare statues of copper, representing the Sirens, or Deities\r\nof the Parthenope, spouting large streams of water into an ample shell,\r\nall of cast metal, and of great cost. This stands at the entrance of the\r\nMole, where we met many of the nobility both on horseback and in their\r\ncoaches to take the fresco from the sea, as the manner is, it being in\r\nthe most advantageous quarter for good air, delight and prospect. Here we\r\nsaw divers goodly horses who handsomely become their riders, the\r\nNeapolitan gentlemen. This Mole is about 500 paces in length, and paved\r\nwith a square hewn stone. From the Mole, we ascend to a church of great\r\nantiquity, formerly sacred to Castor and Pollux, as the Greek letters\r\ncarved on the architrave and the busts of their two statues testify. It\r\nis now converted into a stately oratory by the Theatines.\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral is a most magnificent pile, and except St. Peter's in Rome,\r\nNaples exceeds all cities for stately churches and monasteries. We were\r\ntold that this day the blood of St. Januarius and his head should be\r\nexposed, and so we found it, but obtained not to see the miracle of the\r\nboiling of this blood. The next we went to see was St. Peter's, richly\r\nadorned, the chapel especially, where that Apostle said mass, as is\r\ntestified on the wall.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we went to St. Dominic, where they showed us the crucifix\r\nthat is reported to have said these words to St. Thomas, \"_Benè de me\r\nscripsisti, Thoma_.\" Hence, to the Padri Olivetani, famous for the\r\nmonument of the learned Alexander-ab-Alexandro.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded, the next day, to visit the church of Santa Maria Maggiore,\r\nwhere we spent much time in surveying the chapel of Joh. Jov. Pontanus,\r\nand in it the several and excellent sentences and epitaphs on himself,\r\nwife, children, and friends, full of rare wit, and worthy of recording,\r\nas we find them in several writers. In the same chapel is shown an arm of\r\nTitus Livius, with this epigraph. \"_Titi Livij brachium quod Anton.\r\nPanormita a Patavinis impetravit, Jo. Jovianus Pontanus multos post annos\r\nhôc in loco ponendum curavit._\"\r\n\r\nClimbing a steep hill, we came to the monastery and Church of the\r\nCarthusians, from whence is a most goodly prospect toward the sea and\r\ncity, the one full of galleys and ships, the other of stately palaces,\r\nchurches, monasteries, castles, gardens, delicious fields and meadows,\r\nMount Vesuvius smoking, the promontory of Minerva and Misenum, Capreæ,\r\nProchyta, Ischia, Pausilipum, Puteoli, and the rest, doubtless one of the\r\nmost divertissant and considerable vistas in the world. The church is\r\nmost elegantly built; the very pavements of the common cloister being all\r\nlaid with variously polished marbles, richly figured. They showed us a\r\nmassy cross of silver, much celebrated for the workmanship and carving,\r\nand said to have been fourteen years in perfecting. The choir also is of\r\nrare art; but above all to be admired, is the yet unfinished church of\r\nthe Jesuits, certainly, if accomplished, not to be equalled in Europe.\r\nHence, we passed by the Palazzo Caraffii, full of ancient and very noble\r\nstatues: also the palace of the Orsini. The next day, we did little but\r\nvisit some friends, English merchants, resident for their negotiation;\r\nonly this morning at the Viceroy's Cavalerizza I saw the noblest horses\r\nthat I had ever beheld, one of his sons riding the menage with that\r\naddress and dexterity as I had never seen anything approach it.\r\n\r\n4th February, 1645. We were invited to the collection of exotic rarities\r\nin the Museum of Ferdinando Imperati, a Neapolitan nobleman, and one of\r\nthe most observable palaces in the city, the repository of incomparable\r\nrarities. Among the natural herbals most remarkable was the Byssus marina\r\nand Pinna marina; the male and female chameleon; an Onocrotatus; an\r\nextraordinary great crocodile; some of the Orcades Anates, held here for\r\na great rarity; likewise a salamander; the male and female Manucordiata,\r\nthe male having a hollow in the back, in which it is reported the female\r\nboth lays and hatches her eggs; the mandragoras, of both sexes; Papyrus,\r\nmade of several reeds, and some of silk; tables of the rinds of trees,\r\nwritten with Japonic characters; another of the branches of palm; many\r\nIndian fruits; a crystal that had a quantity of uncongealed water within\r\nits cavity; a petrified fisher's net; divers sorts of tarantulas, being a\r\nmonstrous spider, with lark-like claws, and somewhat bigger.\r\n\r\n5th February, 1645. This day we beheld the Vice-king's procession, which\r\nwas very splendid for the relics, banners, and music that accompanied\r\nthe Blessed Sacrament. The ceremony took up most of the morning.\r\n\r\n6th February, 1645. We went by coach to take the air, and see the\r\ndiversions, or rather madness of the Carnival; the courtesans (who swarm\r\nin this city to the number, as we are told, of 30,000, registered and\r\npaying a tax to the State) flinging eggs of sweet water into our coach,\r\nas we passed by the houses and windows. Indeed, the town is so pestered\r\nwith these cattle, that there needs no small mortification to preserve\r\nfrom their enchantment, while they display all their natural and\r\nartificial beauty, play, sing, feign compliment, and by a thousand\r\nstudied devices seek to inveigle foolish young men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VESUVIUS]\r\n\r\n7th February, 1645. The next day, being Saturday, we went four miles out\r\nof town on mules, to see that famous volcano, Mount Vesuvius. Here we\r\npass a fair fountain, called Labulla, which continually boils, supposed\r\nto proceed from Vesuvius, and thence over a river and bridge, where on a\r\nlarge upright stone, is engraven a notable inscription relative to the\r\nmemorable eruption in 1630.\r\n\r\nApproaching the hill, as we were able with our mules, we alighted,\r\ncrawling up the rest of the proclivity with great difficulty, now with\r\nour feet, now with our hands, not without many untoward slips which did\r\nmuch bruise us on the various colored cinders, with which the whole\r\nmountain is covered, some like pitch, others full of perfect brimstone,\r\nothers metallic, interspersed with innumerable pumices (of all which I\r\nmade a collection), we at the last gained the summit of an extensive\r\naltitude. Turning our faces toward Naples, it presents one of the\r\ngoodliest prospects in the world; all the Baiæ, Cuma, Elysian Fields,\r\nCapreæ, Ischia, Prochyta, Misenus, Puteoli, that goodly city, with a\r\ngreat portion of the Tyrrhene Sea, offering themselves to your view at\r\nonce, and at so agreeable a distance, as nothing can be more delightful.\r\nThe mountain consists of a double top, the one pointed very sharp, and\r\ncommonly appearing above any clouds, the other blunt. Here, as we\r\napproached, we met many large gaping clefts and chasms, out of which\r\nissued such sulphurous blasts and smoke, that we dared not stand long\r\nnear them. Having gained the very summit, I laid myself down to look\r\nover into that most frightful and terrible vorago, a stupendous pit of\r\nnear three miles in circuit, and half a mile in depth, by a perpendicular\r\nhollow cliff (like that from the highest part of Dover Castle), with now\r\nand then a craggy prominency jetting out. The area at the bottom is\r\nplane, like an even floor, which seems to be made by the wind circling\r\nthe ashes by its eddy blasts. In the middle and centre is a hill, shaped\r\nlike a great brown loaf, appearing to consist of sulphurous matter,\r\ncontinually vomiting a foggy exhalation, and ejecting huge stones with an\r\nimpetuous noise and roaring, like the report of many muskets discharging.\r\nThis horrid barathrum engaged our attention for some hours, both for the\r\nstrangeness of the spectacle, and the mention which the old histories\r\nmake of it, as one of the most stupendous curiosities in nature, and\r\nwhich made the learned and inquisitive Pliny adventure his life to detect\r\nthe causes, and to lose it in too desperate an approach. It is likewise\r\nfamous for the stratagem of the rebel, Spartacus, who did so much\r\nmischief to the State lurking among and protected by, these horrid\r\ncaverns, when it was more accessible and less dangerous than it is now;\r\nbut especially notorious it is for the last conflagration, when, in\r\n_anno_ 1630, it burst out beyond what it had ever done in the memory of\r\nhistory; throwing out huge stones and fiery pumices in such quantity, as\r\nnot only environed the whole mountain, but totally buried and overwhelmed\r\ndivers towns and their inhabitants, scattering the ashes more than a\r\nhundred miles, and utterly devastating all those vineyards, where\r\nformerly grew the most incomparable Greco; when, bursting through the\r\nbowels of the earth, it absorbed the very sea, and, with its whirling\r\nwaters, drew in divers galleys and other vessels to their destruction, as\r\nis faithfully recorded. We descended with more ease than we climbed up,\r\nthrough a deep valley of pure ashes, which at the late eruption was a\r\nflowing river of melted and burning brimstone, and so came to our mules\r\nat the foot of the mountain.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, we with our guide visited the so much celebrated Baia, and\r\nnatural rarities of the places adjacent. Here we entered the mountain\r\nPausilypus, at the left hand of which they showed us Virgil's sepulchre\r\nerected on a steep rock, in form of a small rotunda or cupolated column,\r\nbut almost overgrown with bushes and wild bay trees. At the entrance is\r\nthis inscription:\r\n\r\n                _Stanisi Cencovius.\r\n                        1589\r\n    Qui cineres? Tumuli hæc vestigia, conditur olim\r\n        Ille hôc qui cecinit Pascua, Rura Duces.\r\n                Can Ree MDLIII._[26]\r\n\r\n        [Footnote 26: Such is the inscription, as copied by Evelyn;\r\n        but as its sense is not very clear, and the Diary contains\r\n        instances of incorrectness in transcribing, it may be desirable\r\n        to subjoin the distich said (by Keysler in his \"Travels,\" ii. 433)\r\n        to be the only one in the whole mausoleum:\r\n\r\n            \"_Quæ cineris tumulo hæc vestigia? conditur olim\r\n            Ille hoc qui cecinit pascua, rura, duces._\"]\r\n\r\nAfter we were advanced into this noble and altogether wonderful crypt,\r\nconsisting of a passage spacious enough for two coaches to go abreast,\r\ncut through a rocky mountain near three quarters of a mile (by the\r\nancient Cimmerii as reported, but as others say by L. Cocceius, who\r\nemployed a hundred thousand men on it), we came to the midway, where\r\nthere is a well bored through the diameter of this vast mountain, which\r\nadmits the light into a pretty chapel, hewn out of the natural rock,\r\nwherein hang divers lamps, perpetually burning. The way is paved under\r\nfoot; but it does not hinder the dust, which rises so excessively in this\r\nmuch-frequented passage, that we were forced at midday to use a torch. At\r\nlength, we were delivered from the bowels of the earth into one of the\r\nmost delicious plains in the world: the oranges, lemons, pomegranates,\r\nand other fruits, blushing yet on the perpetually green trees; for the\r\nsummer is here eternal, caused by the natural and adventitious heat of\r\nthe earth, warmed through the subterranean fires, as was shown us by our\r\nguide, who alighted, and, cutting up a turf with his knife, and\r\ndelivering it to me, it was so hot, I was hardly able to hold it in my\r\nhands. This mountain is exceedingly fruitful in vines, and exotics grow\r\nreadily.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LAGO D'AGNANO]\r\n\r\nWe now came to a lake of about two miles in circumference, environed with\r\nhills; the water of it is fresh and sweet on the surface, but salt at\r\nbottom; some mineral salt conjectured to be the cause, and it is reported\r\nof that profunditude in the middle that it is bottomless. The people\r\ncall it Lago d'Agnano, from the multitude of serpents which, involved\r\ntogether about the spring, fall down from the cliffy hills into it. It\r\nhas no fish, nor will any live in it. We tried the old experiment on a\r\ndog in the Grotto del Cane, or Charon's Cave; it is not above three or\r\nfour paces deep, and about the height of a man, nor very broad. Whatever\r\nhaving life enters it, presently expires. Of this we made trial with two\r\ndogs, one of which we bound to a short pole to guide him the more\r\ndirectly into the further part of the den, where he was no sooner\r\nentered, but--without the least noise, or so much as a struggle, except\r\nthat he panted for breath, lolling out his tongue, his eyes being\r\nfixed:--we drew him out dead to all appearance; but immediately plunging\r\nhim into the adjoining lake, within less than half an hour he recovered,\r\nand swimming to shore, ran away from us. We tried the same on another\r\ndog, without the application of the water, and left him quite dead. The\r\nexperiment has been made on men, as on that poor creature whom Peter of\r\nToledo caused to go in; likewise on some Turkish slaves; two soldiers,\r\nand other foolhardy persons, who all perished, and could never be\r\nrecovered by the water of the lake, as are dogs; for which many learned\r\nreasons have been offered, as Simon Majolus in his book of the\r\nCanicular-days has mentioned, colloq. 15. And certainly the most likely\r\nis, the effect of those hot and dry vapors which ascend out of the earth,\r\nand are condensed by the ambient cold, as appears by their converting\r\ninto crystalline drops on the top, while at the bottom it is so\r\nexcessively hot, that a torch being extinguished near it, and lifted a\r\nlittle distance, was suddenly re-lighted.\r\n\r\nNear to this cave are the natural stoves of St. Germain, of the nature of\r\nsudatories, in certain chambers partitioned with stone for the sick to\r\nsweat in, the vapors here being exceedingly hot, and of admirable success\r\nin the gout, and other cold distempers of the nerves. Hence, we climed up\r\na hill, the very highway in several places even smoking with heat like a\r\nfurnace. The mountains were by the Greeks called Leucogæi, and the fields\r\nPhlegræn. Hercules here vanquished the Giants, assisted with lightning.\r\nWe now came to the Court of Vulcan, consisting of a valley near a quarter\r\nof a mile in breadth, the margin environed with steep cliffs, out of\r\nwhose sides and foot break forth fire and smoke in abundance, making a\r\nnoise like a tempest of water, and sometimes discharging in loud reports,\r\nlike so many guns. The heat of this place is wonderful, the earth itself\r\nbeing almost unsufferable, and which the subterranean fires have made so\r\nhollow, by having wasted the matter for so many years, that it sounds\r\nlike a drum to those who walk upon it; and the water thus struggling with\r\nthose fires bubbles and spouts aloft into the air. The mouths of these\r\nspiracles are bestrewed with variously colored cinders, which rise with\r\nthe vapor, as do many colored stones, according to the quality of the\r\ncombustible matter, insomuch as it is no little adventure to approach\r\nthem. They are, however, daily frequented both by sick and well; the\r\nformer receiving the fumes, have been recovered of diseases esteemed\r\nincurable. Here we found a great deal of sulphur made, which they refine\r\nin certain houses near the place, casting it into canes, to a very great\r\nvalue. Near this we were showed a hill of alum, where is one of the best\r\nmineries, yielding a considerable revenue. Some flowers of brass are\r\nfound here; but I could not but smile at those who persuade themselves\r\nthat here are the gates of purgatory (for which it may be they have\r\nerected, very near it, a convent, and named it St. Januarius), reporting\r\nto have often heard screeches and horrible lamentations proceeding from\r\nthese caverns and volcanoes; with other legends of birds that are never\r\nseen, save on Sundays, which cast themselves into the lake at night,\r\nappearing no more all the week after.\r\n\r\nWe now approached the ruins of a very stately temple, or theater, of 172\r\nfeet in length, and about 80 in breadth, thrown down by an earthquake,\r\nnot long since; it was consecrated to Vulcan, and under the ground are\r\nmany strange meanders; from which it is named the LABYRINTH; this place\r\nis so haunted with bats, that their perpetual fluttering endangered the\r\nputting out our links.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POZZOLO]\r\n\r\nHence, we passed again those boiling and smoking hills, till we came to\r\nPozzolo, formerly the famous Puteoli, the landing-place of St. Paul, when\r\nhe came into Italy, after the tempest described in the Acts of the\r\nApostles. Here we made a good dinner, and bought divers medals,\r\nantiquities, and other curiosities, of the country people, who daily\r\nfind such things among the very old ruins of those places. This town was\r\nformerly a Greek colony, built by the Samians, a seasonable commodious\r\nport, and full of observable antiquities. We saw the ruins of Neptune's\r\nTemple, to whom this place was sacred, and near it the stately palace and\r\ngardens of Peter de Toledo, formerly mentioned. Afterward, we visited\r\nthat admirably built Temple of Augustus, seeming to have been hewn out of\r\nan entire rock, though indeed consisting of several square stones. The\r\ninscription remains thus: \"_L. Calphurnius L. F. Templum Augusto cum\r\nornamentis D. D._;\" and under it, \"_L. Coccejus L. C. Postumi L. Auctus\r\nArchitectus_.\" It is now converted into a church, in which they showed us\r\nhuge bones, which they affirm to have been of some giant.\r\n\r\nWe went to see the ruins of the old haven, so compact with that\r\nbituminous sand in which the materials are laid, as the like is hardly to\r\nbe found, though all this has not been sufficient to protect it from the\r\nfatal concussions of several earthquakes (frequent here) which have\r\nalmost demolished it, thirteen vast piles of marble only remaining; a\r\nstupendous work in the bosom of Neptune! To this joins the bridge of\r\nCaligula, by which (having now embarked ourselves) we sailed to the\r\npleasant Baia, almost four miles in length, all which way that proud\r\nEmperor would pass in triumph. Here we rowed along toward a villa of the\r\norator Cicero's, where we were shown the ruins of his Academy; and, at\r\nthe foot of a rock, his Baths, the waters reciprocating their tides with\r\nthe neighboring sea. Hard at hand, rises Mount Gaurus, being, as I\r\nconceived, nothing save a heap of pumices, which here float in abundance\r\non the sea, exhausted of all inflammable matter by the fire, which\r\nrenders them light and porous, so as the beds of nitre, which lie deep\r\nunder them, having taken fire, do easily eject them. They dig much for\r\nfancied treasure said to be concealed about this place. From hence, we\r\ncoasted near the ruins of Portus Julius, where we might see divers\r\nstately palaces that had been swallowed up by the sea after earthquakes.\r\nComing to shore, we pass by the Lucrine Lake, so famous heretofore for\r\nits delicious oysters, now producing few or none, being divided from the\r\nsea by a bank of incredible labor, the supposed work of Hercules; it is\r\nnow half choked up with rubbish, and by part of the new mountain, which\r\nrose partly out of it, and partly out of the sea, and that in the space\r\nof one night and a day, to a very great altitude, on the 29th September,\r\n1538, after many terrible earthquakes, which ruined divers places\r\nthereabout, when at midnight the sea retiring near 200 paces, and yawning\r\non the sudden, it continued to vomit forth flames and fiery stones in\r\nsuch quantity, as produced this whole mountain by their fall, making the\r\ninhabitants of Pozzolo to leave their habitations, supposing the end of\r\nthe world had been come.\r\n\r\nFrom the left part of this, we walked to the Lake Avernus of a round\r\nform, and totally environed with mountains. This lake was feigned by the\r\npoet for the gates of hell, by which Æneas made his descent, and where he\r\nsacrificed to Pluto and the Manes. The waters are of a remarkably black\r\ncolor; but I tasted of them without danger; hence, they feign that the\r\nriver Styx has its source. At one side, stand the handsome ruins of a\r\nTemple dedicated to Apollo, or rather Pluto, but it is controverted.\r\nOpposite to this, having new lighted our torches, we enter a vast cave,\r\nin which having gone about two hundred paces, we pass a narrow entry\r\nwhich leads us into a room of about ten paces long, proportionably broad\r\nand high; the side walls and roof retain still the golden mosaic, though\r\nnow exceedingly decayed by time. Here is a short cell or rather niche,\r\ncut out of the solid rock, somewhat resembling a couch, in which they\r\nreport that the Sibylla lay, and uttered her Oracles; but it is supposed\r\nby most to have been a bath only. This subterranean grot leads quite\r\nthrough to Cuma, but is in some places obstructed by the earth which has\r\nsunk in, so as we were constrained back again, and to creep on our\r\nbellies, before we came to the light. It is reported Nero had once\r\nresolved to cut a channel for two great galleys that should have extended\r\nto Ostia, 150 miles distant. The people now call it Licola.\r\n\r\nFrom hence, we ascended to that most ancient city of Italy, the renowned\r\nCuma, built by the Grecians. It stands on a very eminent promontory, but\r\nis now a heap of ruins. A little below, stands the Arco Felice,\r\nheretofore part of Apollo's Temple, with the foundations of divers goodly\r\nbuildings; among whose heaps are frequently found statues and other\r\nantiquities, by such as dig for them. Near this is the Lake Acherutia,\r\nand Acheron. Returning to the shore, we came to the Bagni de Tritoli and\r\nDiana, which are only long narrow passages cut through the main rock,\r\nwhere the vapors ascend so hot, that entering with the body erect you\r\nwill even faint with excessive perspiration; but, stooping lower, as\r\nsudden a cold surprises. These sudatories are much in request for many\r\ninfirmities. Now we entered the haven of the Bahiæ, where once stood that\r\nfamous town, so-called from the companion of Ulysses here buried; not\r\nwithout great reason celebrated for one of the most delicious places that\r\nthe sun shines on, according to that of Horace:\r\n\r\n    \"_Nullus in Orbe locus Baiis prælucet amoenis._\"\r\n\r\nThough, as to the stately fabrics, there now remain little save the\r\nruins, whereof the most entire is that of Diana's Temple, and another of\r\nVenus. Here were those famous poles of lampreys that would come to hand\r\nwhen called by name, as Martial tells us. On the summit of the rock\r\nstands a strong castle garrisoned to protect the shore from Turkish\r\npirates. It was once the retiring place of Julius Cæsar.\r\n\r\nPassing by the shore again, we entered Bauli, observable from the\r\nmonstrous murder of Nero committed on his mother Agrippina. Her sepulchre\r\nwas yet shown us in the rock, which we entered, being covered with sundry\r\nheads and figures of beasts. We saw there the roots of a tree turned into\r\nstone, and are continually dropping.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MISENUS]\r\n\r\nThus having viewed the foundations of the old Cimmeria, the palaces of\r\nMarius, Pompey, Nero, Hortensius, and other villas and antiquities, we\r\nproceeded toward the promontory of Misenus, renowned for the sepulchre of\r\nÆneas's Trumpeter. It was once a great city, now hardly a ruin, said to\r\nhave been built from this place to the promontory of Minerva, fifty miles\r\ndistant, now discontinued and demolished by the frequent earthquakes.\r\nHere was the villa of Caius Marius, where Tiberius Cæsar died; and here\r\nruns the Aqueduct, thought to be dug by Nero, a stupendous passage,\r\nheretofore nobly arched with marble, as the ruins testify. Hence, we\r\nwalked to those receptacles of water called _Piscina Mirabilis_, being a\r\nvault of 500 feet long, and twenty-two in breadth, the roof propped up\r\nwith four ranks of square pillars, twelve in a row; the walls are brick,\r\nplastered over with such a composition as for strength and politure\r\nresembles white marble. 'Tis conceived to have been built by Nero, as a\r\nconservatory for fresh water; as were also the Centi Camerelli, into\r\nwhich we were next led. All these crypta being now almost sunk into the\r\nearth, show yet their former amplitude and magnificence.\r\n\r\nReturning toward the Baia, we again pass the Elysian Fields, so\r\ncelebrated by the poets, nor unworthily, for their situation and verdure,\r\nbeing full of myrtles and sweet shrubs, and having a most delightful\r\nprospect toward the Tyrrhene Sea. Upon the verge of these remain the\r\nruins of the Mercato di Saboto, formerly a Circus; over the arches stand\r\ndivers urns, full of Roman ashes.\r\n\r\nHaving well satisfied our curiosity among these antiquities, we retired\r\nto our felucca, which rowed us back again toward Pozzolo, at the very\r\nplace of St. Paul's landing. Keeping along the shore, they showed us a\r\nplace where the sea water and sands did exceedingly boil. Thence, to the\r\nisland Nesis, once the fabulous Nymph; and thus we leave the Baia, so\r\nrenowned for the sweet retirements of the most opulent and voluptuous\r\nRomans. They certainly were places of uncommon amenity, as their yet\r\ntempting site, and other circumstances of natural curiosities, easily\r\ninvite me to believe, since there is not in the world so many stupendous\r\nrarities to be met with, as in the circle of a few miles which environ\r\nthese blissful abodes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NAPLES]\r\n\r\n8th February, 1645. Returned to Naples, we went to see the Arsenal, well\r\nfurnished with galleys and other vessels. The city is crowded with\r\ninhabitants, gentlemen and merchants. The government is held of the Pope\r\nby an annual tribute of 40,000 ducats and a white jennet; but the\r\nSpaniard trusts more to the power of those his natural subjects there;\r\nApulia and Calabria yielding him near four millions of crowns yearly to\r\nmaintain it. The country is divided into thirteen Provinces, twenty\r\nArchbishops, and one hundred and seven Bishops; the estates of the\r\nnobility, in default of the male line, reverting to the King. Besides the\r\nVice-Roy, there is among the Chief Magistrates a High Constable,\r\nAdmiral, Chief Justice, Great Chamberlain, and Chancellor, with a\r\nSecretary; these being prodigiously avaricious, do wonderfully enrich\r\nthemselves out of the miserable people's labor, silks, manna, sugar, oil,\r\nwine, rice, sulphur, and alum; for with all these riches is this\r\ndelicious country blest. The manna falls at certain seasons on the\r\nadjoining hills in form of a thick dew. The very winter here is a summer,\r\never fruitful, so that in the middle of February we had melons, cherries,\r\napricots, and many other sorts of fruit.\r\n\r\nThe building of the city is for the size the most magnificent of any in\r\nEurope, the streets exceeding large, well paved, having many vaults and\r\nconveyances under them for the sulliage; which renders them very sweet\r\nand clean, even in the midst of winter. To it belongeth more than 3,000\r\nchurches and monasteries, and these the best built and adorned of any in\r\nItaly. They greatly affect the Spanish gravity in their habit; delight in\r\ngood horses; the streets are full of gallants on horseback, in coaches\r\nand sedans, from hence brought first into England by Sir Sanders Duncomb.\r\nThe women are generally well featured, but excessively libidinous. The\r\ncountry people so jovial and addicted to music, that the very husbandmen\r\nalmost universally play on the guitar, singing and composing songs in\r\npraise of their sweethearts, and will commonly go to the field with their\r\nfiddle; they are merry, witty, and genial; all which I much attribute to\r\nthe excellent quality of the air. They have a deadly hatred to the\r\nFrench, so that some of our company were flouted at for wearing red\r\ncloaks, as the mode then was.\r\n\r\nThis I made the _non ultra_ of my travels, sufficiently sated with\r\nrolling up and down, and resolving within myself to be no longer an\r\n_individuum vagum_, if ever I got home again; since, from the report of\r\ndivers experienced and curious persons, I had been assured there was\r\nlittle more to be seen in the rest of the civil world, after Italy,\r\nFrance, Flanders, and the Low Countries, but plain and prodigious\r\nbarbarism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROME]\r\n\r\nThus, about the 7th of February,[27] we set out on our return to Rome by\r\nthe same way we came, not daring to adventure by sea, as some of our\r\ncompany were inclined to do, for fear of Turkish pirates hovering on that\r\ncoast; nor made we any stay save at Albano, to view the celebrated place\r\nand sepulchre of the famous duelists who decided the ancient quarrel\r\nbetween their imperious neighbors with the loss of their lives. These\r\nbrothers, the Horatii and Curiatii, lie buried near the highway, under\r\ntwo ancient pyramids of stone, now somewhat decayed and overgrown with\r\nrubbish. We took the opportunity of tasting the wine here, which is\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: Evelyn's dates in this portion of his Diary appear to\r\n    require occasionally that qualification of \"about.\"]\r\n\r\nBeing arrived at Rome on the 13th of February, we were again invited to\r\nSignor Angeloni's study, where with greater leisure we surveyed the\r\nrarities, as his cabinet and medals especially, esteemed one of the best\r\ncollections of them in Europe. He also showed us two antique lamps, one\r\nof them dedicated to Pallas, the other _Laribus Sacru'_, as appeared by\r\ntheir inscriptions; some old Roman rings and keys; the Egyptian Isis,\r\ncast in iron; sundry rare basso-relievos; good pieces of paintings,\r\nprincipally of Christ of Correggio, with this painter's own face\r\nadmirably done by himself; divers of both the Bassanos; a great number of\r\npieces by Titian, particularly the Triumphs; an infinity of natural\r\nrarities, dried animals, Indian habits and weapons, shells, etc.; divers\r\nvery antique statues of brass; some lamps of so fine an earth that they\r\nresembled cornelians, for transparency and color; hinges of Corinthian\r\nbrass, and one great nail of the same metal found in the ruins of Nero's\r\ngolden house.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, we ferried over to Transtevere, to the palace of Gichi,\r\nto review the works of Raphael: and, returning by St. Angelo, we saw the\r\ncastle as far as was permitted, and on the other side considered those\r\nadmirable pilasters supposed to be of the foundation of the Pons\r\nSublicius, over which Horatius Cocles passed; here anchor three or four\r\nwater mills, invented by Belizarius: and thence had another sight of the\r\nFarnesi's gardens, and of the terrace where is that admirable painting of\r\nRaphael, being a Cupid playing with a Dolphin, wrought _á fresco_,\r\npreserved in shutters of wainscot, as well it merits, being certainly one\r\nof the most wonderful pieces of work in the world.\r\n\r\n14th February, 1645. I went to Santa Cecilia, a church built and endowed\r\nby Cardinal Sfrondæti, who has erected a stately altar near the body of\r\nthis martyr, not long before found in a vesture of silk girt about, a\r\nveil on her head, and the bloody scars of three wounds on the neck; the\r\nbody is now in a silver chest, with her statue over it, in snow-white\r\nmarble. Other Saints lie here, decorated with splendid ornaments, lamps,\r\nand incensories of great cost. A little farther, they show us the Bath of\r\nSt. Cecilia, to which joins a Convent of Friars, where is the picture of\r\nthe Flagellation by Vanni, and the columns of the portico, taken from the\r\nBaths of Septimius Severus.\r\n\r\n15th February, 1645. Mr. Henshaw and I walked by the Tiber, and visited\r\nthe Stola Tybertina (now St. Bartholomew's), formerly cut in the shape of\r\na ship, and wharfed with marble, in which a lofty obelisk represented the\r\nmast. In the church of St. Bartholomew is the body of the Apostle. Here\r\nare the ruins of the Temple of Æsculapius, now converted into a stately\r\nhospital and a pretty convent. Opposite to it, is the convent and church\r\nof St. John Calabita, where I saw nothing remarkable, save an old broken\r\naltar. Here was the Temple of Fortuna Virilis. Hence, we went to a\r\ncupola, now a church, formerly dedicated to the sun. Opposite to it,\r\nSanta Maria Schola Græca, where formerly that tongue was taught; said to\r\nbe the second church dedicated in Rome to the Blessed Virgin; bearing\r\nalso the title of a Cardinalate. Behind this stands the great altar of\r\nHercules, much demolished. Near this, being at the foot of Mount\r\nAventine, are the Pope's salt houses. Ascending the hill, we came to St.\r\nSabina, an ancient fabric, formerly sacred to Diana; there, in a chapel,\r\nis an admirable picture, the work of Livia Fontana, set about with\r\ncolumns of alabaster, and in the middle of the church is a stone, cast,\r\nas they report, by the Devil at St. Dominic, while he was at mass. Hence,\r\nwe traveled toward a heap of rubbish, called the Marmorata, on the bank\r\nof the Tiber, a magazine of stones; and near which formerly stood a\r\ntriumphal arch, in honor of Horatius vanquishing the Tuscans. The ruins\r\nof the bridge yet appear.\r\n\r\nWe were now got to Mons Testaceus, a heap of potsherds, almost 200 feet\r\nhigh, thought to have been thrown there and amassed by the subjects of\r\nthe Commonwealth bringing their tribute in earthen vessels, others (more\r\nprobably) that it was a quarter of the town where potters lived; at the\r\nsummit Rome affords a noble prospect. Before it is a spacious green,\r\ncalled the Hippodrome, where Olympic games were celebrated, and the\r\npeople mustered, as in our London Artillery-Ground. Going hence, to the\r\nold wall of the city, we much admired the pyramid, or tomb, of Caius\r\nCestius, of white marble, one of the most ancient entire monuments,\r\ninserted in the wall, with this inscription:\r\n\r\n    \"_C. Cestius L. F. Pob. Epulo (an order of priests) Pr. Tr. pl.\r\n    VII. Vir. Epulonum._\"\r\n\r\nAnd a little beneath:\r\n\r\n    \"_Opus absolutum ex testamento diebus CCCXXX. arbitratu. Ponti P.\r\n    F. Cla. Melæ Heredis et Pothi L._\"\r\n\r\nAt the left hand, is the Port of St. Paul, once Tergemina, out of which\r\nthe three Horatii passed to encounter the Curiatii of Albano. Hence,\r\nbending homeward by St. Saba, by Antoninus's baths (which we entered), is\r\nthe marble sepulchre of Vespasian. The thickness of the walls and the\r\nstately ruins show the enormous magnitude of these baths. Passing by a\r\ncorner of the Circus Maximus, we viewed the place where stood the\r\nSeptizonium, demolished by Sextus V., for fear of its falling. Going by\r\nMons Coelius, we beheld the devotions of St. Maria in Naviculâ, so\r\nnamed from a ship carved out in white marble standing on a pedestal\r\nbefore it, supposed to be the vow of one escaped from shipwreck. It has a\r\nglorious front to the street. Adjoining to this are the Hortii Mathæi,\r\nwhich only of all the places about the city I omitted visiting, though I\r\nwas told inferior to no garden in Rome for statues, ancient monuments,\r\naviaries, fountains, groves, and especially a noble obelisk, and\r\nmaintained in beauty at an expense of 6,000 crowns yearly, which, if not\r\nexpended to keep up its beauty, forfeits the possession of a greater\r\nrevenue to another family: so curious are they in their villas and places\r\nof pleasure, even to excess.\r\n\r\nThe next day, we went to the once famous Circus Caracalla, in the midst\r\nof which there now lay prostrate one of the most stately and ancient\r\nobelisks, full of Egyptian hieroglyphics. It was broken into four pieces,\r\nwhen overthrown by the Barbarians, and would have been purchased and\r\ntransported into England by the magnificent Thomas Earl of Arundel,\r\ncould it have been well removed to the sea. This is since set together\r\nand placed on the stupendous artificial rock made by Innocent X., and\r\nserving for a fountain in Piazza Navona, the work of Bernini, the Pope's\r\narchitect. Near this is the sepulchre of Metellus, of massy stone, pretty\r\nentire, now called Capo di Bovo. Hence, to a small oratory, named\r\n\"_Domine, quo vadis_\"; where the tradition is, that our Blessed Savior\r\nmet St. Peter as he fled, and turned him back again.\r\n\r\nSt. Sebastian's was the next, a mean structure (the _facciáta_ excepted),\r\nbut is venerable, especially for the relics and grots, in which lie the\r\nashes of many holy men. Here is kept the pontifical chair sprinkled with\r\nthe blood of Pope Stephen, to which great devotion is paid; also a well\r\nfull of martyrs' bones, and the sepulchre of St. Sebastian, with one of\r\nthe arrows (used in shooting him). These are preserved by the Fulgentine\r\nMonks, who have here their monastery, and who led us down into a grotto\r\nwhich they affirmed went divers furlongs under ground; the sides, or\r\nwalls which we passed were filled with bones and dead bodies, laid (as it\r\nwere) on shelves, whereof some were shut up with broad stones and now and\r\nthen a cross, or a palm, cut in them. At the end of some of these\r\nsubterranean passages, were square rooms with altars in them, said to\r\nhave been the receptacles of primitive Christians, in the times of\r\npersecution, nor seems it improbable.\r\n\r\n17th February, 1645. I was invited, after dinner, to the Academy of the\r\nHumorists, kept in a spacious hall belonging to Signor Mancini, where the\r\nwits of the town meet on certain days to recite poems, and debate on\r\nseveral subjects. The first that speaks is called the Lord, and stands in\r\nan eminent place, and then the rest of the Virtuosi recite in order. By\r\nthese ingenious exercises, besides the learned discourses, is the purity\r\nof the Italian tongue daily improved. The room is hung round with\r\ndevices, or emblems, with mottoes under them. There are several other\r\nAcademies of this nature, bearing like fantastical titles. In this of the\r\nHumorists is the picture of Guarini, the famous author of the Pastor\r\nFido, once of this society. The chief part of the day we spent in hearing\r\nthe academic exercises.\r\n\r\n18th February, 1645. We walked to St. Nicholas in Carcere; it has a fair\r\nfront, and within are parts of the bodies of St. Mark and Marcellino; on\r\nthe Tribuna is a painting of Gentileschi, and the altar of Caval;\r\nBaglioni, with some other rare paintings. Coming round from hence we\r\npassed by the Circus Flaminius, formerly very large, now totally in\r\nruins. In the afternoon, we visited the English Jesuits, with whose\r\nSuperior, P. Stafford, I was well acquainted; who received us\r\ncourteously. They call their church and college St. Thomasso de gli\r\nInglesi, and is a seminary. Among other trifles, they show the relics of\r\nBecket, their reputed martyr. Of paintings there is one of Durante, and\r\nmany representing the sufferings of several of their society executed in\r\nEngland, especially F. Campion.\r\n\r\nIn the Hospital of the Pelerini della S. Trinita, I had seen the feet of\r\nmany pilgrims washed by Princes, Cardinals, and noble Romans, and served\r\nat table, as the ladies and noble women did to other poor creatures in\r\nanother room. It was told us that no less than 444,000 men had been thus\r\ntreated in the Jubilee of 1600, and 25,500 women, as appears by the\r\nregister, which brings store of money.\r\n\r\nReturning homeward, I saw the palace of Cardinal Spada, where is a most\r\nmagnificent hall painted by Daniel de Volterra and Giulio Piacentino, who\r\nmade the fret in the little Court; but the rare perspectives are of\r\nBolognesi. Near this is the Mont Pieta, instituted as a bank for the\r\npoor, who, if the sum be not great, may have money upon pawns. To this\r\njoins St. Martino, to which belongs a Schola, or Corporation, that do\r\nmany works of charity. Hence we came through Campo di Fiori, or\r\nherb-market, in the midst of which is a fountain casting out water of a\r\ndolphin, in copper; and in this piazza is common execution done.\r\n\r\n19th February, 1645. I went, this afternoon, to visit my Lord John\r\nSomerset, brother to the Marquis of Worcester, who had his apartment in\r\nPalazzo della Cancellaria, belonging to Cardinal Francesco Barberini, as\r\nVice-chancellor of the Church of Rome, and Protector of the English. The\r\nbuilding is of the famous architect, Bramante, of incrusted marble, with\r\nfour ranks of noble lights; the principal entrance is of Fontana's\r\ndesign, and all marble; the portico within sustained by massy columns;\r\non the second peristyle above, the chambers are rarely painted by\r\nSalviati and Vasari; and so ample is this palace, that six princes with\r\ntheir families have been received in it at one time, without incommoding\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n20th February, 1645. I went, as was my usual custom, and spent an\r\nafternoon in Piazza Navona, as well as to see what antiquities I could\r\npurchase among the people who hold market there for medals, pictures, and\r\nsuch curiosities, as to hear the mountebanks prate and distribute their\r\nmedicines. This was formerly the Circus, or Agonales, dedicated to sports\r\nand pastimes, and is now the greatest market of the city, having three\r\nmost noble fountains, and the stately palaces of the Pamfilii, St.\r\nGiacomo de Spagnoli belonging to that nation, to which add two convents\r\nfor friars and nuns, all Spanish. In this Church was erected a most\r\nstately catafalco, or capellar ardente, for the death of the Queen of\r\nSpain; the church was hung with black, and here I heard a Spanish sermon,\r\nor funeral oration, and observed the statues, devices, and impresses hung\r\nabout the walls, the church and pyramid stuck with thousands of lights\r\nand tapers, which made a glorious show. The statue of St. James is by\r\nSansovino; there are also some good pictures of Caracci. The _facciáta_,\r\ntoo, is fair. Returning home, I passed by the stumps of old Pasquin, at\r\nthe corner of a street, called Strada Pontificia; here they still paste\r\nup their drolling lampoons and scurrilous papers. This had formerly been\r\none of the best statues for workmanship and art in all the city, as the\r\nremaining bust does still show.\r\n\r\n21st February, 1645. I walked in the morning up the hill toward the\r\nCapuchins, where was then Cardinal Unufrio (brother to the late Pope\r\nUrban VIII.) of the same order. He built them a pretty church, full of\r\nrare pictures, and there lies the body of St. Felix, that they say still\r\ndoes miracles. The piece at the great altar is by Lanfranc. It is a lofty\r\nedifice, with a beautiful avenue of trees, and in a good air. After\r\ndinner, passing along the Strada del Corso, I observed the column of\r\nAntoninus, passing under Arco Portugallo, which is but a relic,\r\nheretofore erected in honor of Domitian, called now Portugallo, from a\r\nCardinal living near it. A little further on the right hand stands the\r\ncolumn in a small piazza, heretofore set up in honor of M. Aurelius\r\nAntoninus, comprehending in a basso-relievo of white marble his hostile\r\nacts against the Parthians, Armenians, Germans, etc; but it is now\r\nsomewhat decayed. On the summit has been placed the image of St. Paul, of\r\ngilded copper. The pillar is said to be 161 feet high, ascended by 207\r\nsteps, receiving light by fifty-six apertures, without defacing the\r\nsculpture.\r\n\r\nAt a little distance, are the relics of the Emperor's palace, the heads\r\nof whose pillars show them to have been Corinthian.\r\n\r\nTurning a little down, we came to another piazza, in which stands a\r\nsumptuous vase of porphyry, and a fair fountain; but the grace of this\r\nmarket, and indeed the admiration of the whole world, is the Pantheon,\r\nnow called S. Maria della Rotonda, formerly sacred to all the Gods, and\r\nstill remaining the most entire antiquity of the city. It was built by\r\nMarcus Agrippa, as testifies the architrave of the portico, sustained by\r\nthirteen pillars of Theban marble, six feet thick, and fifty-three in\r\nheight, of one entire stone. In this porch is an old inscription.\r\n\r\nEntering the church, we admire the fabric, wholly covered with one\r\ncupola, seemingly suspended in the air, and receiving light by a hole in\r\nthe middle only. The structure is near as high as broad, viz, 144 feet,\r\nnot counting the thickness of the walls, which is twenty-two more to the\r\ntop, all of white marble; and, till Urban VIII. converted part of the\r\nmetal into ordnance of war against the Duke of Parma, and part to make\r\nthe high altar in St. Peter's, it was all over covered with Corinthian\r\nbrass, ascending by forty degrees within the roof, or convex, of the\r\ncupola, richly carved in octagons in the stone. There are niches in the\r\nwalls, in which stood heretofore the statues of Jupiter and the other\r\nGods and Goddesses; for here was that Venus which had hung in her ear the\r\nother Union[28] that Cleopatra was about to dissolve and drink up, as\r\nshe had done its fellow. There are several of these niches, one above\r\nanother for the celestial, terrestrial, and subterranean deities; but the\r\nplace is now converted into a church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin and\r\nall the Saints. The pavement is excellent, and the vast folding-gates, of\r\nCorinthian brass. In a word, it is of all the Roman antiquities the most\r\nworthy of notice. There lie interred in this Temple the famous Raphael di\r\nUrbino, Perino del Vaga, F. Zuccharo, and other painters.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 28:\r\n\r\n        And in the cup an UNION shall he throw,\r\n        Richer than that which four successive kings\r\n        In Denmark's crown have worn.\r\n        --Shakespeare, \"Hamlet,\" Act v. Sc. 2.\r\n\r\n    Theobald says, an UNION is the finest sort of pearl, and has its\r\n    place in all crowns and coronets. The Latin word for a single large\r\n    pearl, it is hardly necessary to add, is _unio_.]\r\n\r\nReturning home, we pass by Cardinal Cajetan's Palace, a noble piece of\r\narchitecture of Vincenzo Ammanatti, which is the grace of the whole\r\nCorso.\r\n\r\n22d February, 1645. I went to Trinitá del Monte, a monastery of French, a\r\nnoble church built by Louis XI. and Charles VIII., the chapels well\r\npainted, especially that by Zaccara da Volterra, and the cloister with\r\nthe miracles of their St. Francis de Paulo, and the heads of the French\r\nKings. In the _pergolo_ above, the walls are wrought with excellent\r\nperspective, especially the St. John; there are the Babylonish dials,\r\ninvented by Kircher, the Jesuit. This convent, so eminently situated on\r\nMons Pincius, has the entire prospect of Campus Martius, and has a fair\r\ngarden which joins to the Palazzo di Medici.\r\n\r\n23d February, 1645. I went to hear a sermon at St. Giacomo degli\r\nIncurabili, a fair church built by F. da Volterra, of good architecture,\r\nand so is the hospital, where only desperate patients are brought. I\r\npassed the evening at St. Maria del Popolo, heretofore Nero's sepulchre,\r\nwhere his ashes lay many years in a marble chest. To this church joins\r\nthe monastery of St. Augustine, which has pretty gardens on Mons Pincius,\r\nand in the church is the miraculous shrine of the Madonna which Pope Paul\r\nIII. brought barefooted to the place, supplicating for a victory over the\r\nTurks in 1464. In a chapel of the Ghisi, are some rare paintings of\r\nRaphael, and noble sculptures. Those two in the choir are by Sansovino,\r\nand in the Chapel de Cerasii, a piece of Caravaggio. Here lie buried many\r\ngreat scholars and artists, of which I took notice of this inscription:\r\n\r\n    \"_Hospes, disce novum mortis genus; improba felis,\r\n      Dum trahitur, digitum mordet, et intereo._\"\r\n\r\nOpposite to the _facciátæ_ of the church is a superb obelisk full of\r\nhieroglyphics, the same that Sennesertus, King of Egypt, dedicated to the\r\nSun; brought to Rome by Augustus, erected in the Circus Maximus, and\r\nsince placed here by Pope Sextus V. It is eighty-eight feet high, of one\r\nentire stone, and placed with great art and engines by the famous\r\nDomenico Fontana.\r\n\r\nHence, turning on the right out of the Porto del Popolo, we came to\r\nJustinian's gardens, near the Muro Torto, so prominently built as\r\nthreatening every moment to fall, yet standing so for these thousand\r\nyears. Under this is the burying place for the common prostitutes, where\r\nthey are put into the ground, _sans ceremonie_.\r\n\r\n24th February, 1645. We walked to St. Roche's and Martine's, near the\r\nbrink of the Tiber, a large hospital for both sexes. Hence, to the\r\nMausoleum Augusti, between the Tiber and the Via Flaminia, now much\r\nruined, which had formerly contended for its sumptuous architecture. It\r\nwas intended as a cemetery for the Roman Emperors, had twelve ports, and\r\nwas covered with a cupola of white marble, environed with stately trees\r\nand innumerable statues, all of it now converted into a garden. We passed\r\nthe afternoon at the Sapienza, a very stately building full of good\r\nmarbles, especially the portico, of admirable architecture. These are\r\nproperly the University Schools, where lectures are read on Law,\r\nMedicine, and Anatomy, and students perform their exercises.\r\n\r\nHence, we walked to the church of St. Andrea della Valle, near the former\r\nTheater of Pompey, and the famous Piccolomini, but given to this church\r\nand the Order, who are Theatins. The Barberini have in this place a\r\nchapel, of curious incrusted marbles of several sorts, and rare\r\npaintings. Under it is a place where St. Sebastian is said to have been\r\nbeaten with rods before he was shot with darts. The cupola is painted by\r\nLanfranc, an inestimable work, and the whole fabric and monastery\r\nadjoining are admirable.\r\n\r\n25th February, 1645. I was invited by a Dominican Friar, whom we usually\r\nheard preach to a number of Jews, to be godfather to a converted Turk and\r\nJew. The ceremony was performed in the Church of Santa Maria sopra la\r\nMinerva, near the Capitol. They were clad in white; then exorcised at\r\ntheir entering the church with abundance of ceremonies, and, when led\r\ninto the choir, were baptized by a Bishop, _in pontificalibus_. The Turk\r\nlived afterward in Rome, sold hot waters and would bring us presents when\r\nhe met us, kneeling and kissing the hems of our cloaks; but the Jew was\r\nbelieved to be a counterfeit. This church, situated on a spacious rising,\r\nwas formerly consecrated to Minerva. It was well built and richly\r\nadorned, and the body of St. Catherine di Sienna lies buried here. The\r\npaintings of the chapel are by Marcello Venuti; the Madonna over the\r\naltar is by Giovanni di Fiesole, called the Angelic Painter, who was of\r\nthe Order of these Monks. There are many charities dealt publicly here,\r\nespecially at the procession on the Annunciation, where I saw his\r\nHoliness, with all the Cardinals, Prelates, etc., _in pontificalibus_;\r\ndowries being given to 300 poor girls all clad in white. The Pope had his\r\ntiara on his head, and was carried on men's shoulders in an open\r\narmchair, blessing the people as he passed. The statue of Christ, at the\r\nColumna, is esteemed one of the masterpieces of M. Angelo: innumerable\r\nare the paintings by the best artists, and the organ is accounted one of\r\nthe sweetest in Rome. Cardinal Bembo is interred here. We returned by St.\r\nMark's, a stately church, with an excellent pavement, and a fine piece by\r\nPerugino, of the Two Martyrs. Adjoining to this is a noble palace built\r\nby the famous Bramante.\r\n\r\n26th February, 1645. Ascending the hill, we came to the Forum Trajanum,\r\nwhere his column stands yet entire, wrought with admirable basso-relievo\r\nrecording the Dacian war, the figures at the upper part appearing of the\r\nsame proportion with those below. It is ascended by 192 steps,\r\nenlightened with 44 apertures, or windows, artificially disposed; in\r\nheight from the pedestal 140 feet.\r\n\r\nIt had once the ashes of Trajan and his statue, where now stands St.\r\nPeter's of gilt brass, erected by Pope Sextus V. The sculpture of this\r\nstupendous pillar is thought to be the work of Apollodorus; but what is\r\nvery observable is, the descent to the plinth of the pedestal, showing\r\nhow this ancient city lies now buried in her ruins; this monument being\r\nat first set up on a rising ground. After dinner, we took the air in\r\nCardinal Bentivoglio's delicious gardens, now but newly deceased. He had\r\na fair palace built by several good masters on part of the ruins of\r\nConstantine's Baths; well adorned with columns and paintings, especially\r\nthose of Guido Reni.\r\n\r\n27th February, 1645. In the morning Mr. Henshaw and myself walked to the\r\nTrophies of Marius, erected in honor of his victory over the Cimbrians,\r\nbut these now taken out of their niches are placed on the balusters of\r\nthe Capitol, so that their ancient station is now a ruin. Keeping on our\r\nway, we came to St. Croce of Jerusalem, built by Constantine over the\r\ndemolition of the Temple of Venus and Cupid, which he threw down; and it\r\nwas here, they report, he deposited the wood of the true Cross, found by\r\nhis mother, Helena; in honor whereof this church was built, and in memory\r\nof his victory over Maxentius when that holy sign appeared to him. The\r\nedifice without is Gothic, but very glorious within, especially the roof,\r\nand one tribuna (gallery) well painted. Here is a chapel dedicated to St.\r\nHelena, the floor whereof is of earth brought from Jerusalem; the walls\r\nare of fair mosaic, in which they suffer no women to enter, save once a\r\nyear. Under the high altar of the Church is buried St. Anastasius, in\r\nLydian marble, and Benedict VII.; and they show a number of relics,\r\nexposed at our request; with a phial of our blessed Savior's blood; two\r\nthorns of his crown; three chips of the real cross; one of the nails,\r\nwanting a point; St. Thomas's doubting finger; and a fragment of the\r\ntitle (put on the cross), being part of a thin board; some of Judas's\r\npieces of silver; and many more, if one had faith to believe it. To this\r\nvenerable church joins a Monastery, the gardens taking up the space of an\r\nancient amphitheatre.\r\n\r\nHence, we passed beyond the walls out at the Port of St. Laurence, to\r\nthat Saint's church, and where his ashes are enshrined. This was also\r\nbuilt by the same great Constantine, famous for the Coronation of Pietro\r\nAltissiodorensis, Emperor of Constantinople, by Honorius II. It is said\r\nthe corpse of St. Stephen, the proto martyr, was deposited here by that\r\nof St. Sebastian, which it had no sooner touched, but Sebastian gave it\r\nplace of its own accord. The Church has no less than seven privileged\r\naltars, and excellent pictures. About the walls are painted this\r\nmartyr's sufferings; and, when they built them, the bones of divers\r\nsaints were translated to other churches. The front is Gothic. In our\r\nreturn, we saw a small ruin of an aqueduct built by Quintus Marcius, the\r\nprætor; and so passed through that incomparable straight street leading\r\nto Santa Maria Maggiore, to our lodging, sufficiently tired.\r\n\r\nWe were taken up next morning in seeing the impertinences of the\r\nCarnival, when all the world are as mad at Rome as at other places; but\r\nthe most remarkable were the three races of the Barbary horses, that run\r\nin the Strada del Corso without riders, only having spurs so placed on\r\ntheir backs, and hanging down by their sides, as by their motion to\r\nstimulate them: then of mares, then of asses, of buffalos, naked men, old\r\nand young, and boys, and abundance of idle ridiculous pastime. One thing\r\nis remarkable, their acting comedies on a stage placed on a cart, or\r\n_plaustrum_, where the scene, or tiring place, is made of boughs in a\r\nrural manner, which they drive from street to street with a yoke or two\r\nof oxen, after the ancient guise. The streets swarm with prostitutes,\r\nbuffoons, and all manner of rabble.\r\n\r\n1st March, 1645. At the Greek Church, we saw the Eastern ceremonies\r\nperformed by a Bishop, etc., in that tongue. Here the unfortunate Duke\r\nand Duchess of Bouillon received their ashes, it being the first day of\r\nLent. There was now as much trudging up and down of devotees, as the day\r\nbefore of licentious people; all saints alike to appearance.\r\n\r\nThe gardens of Justinian, which we next visited, are very full of statues\r\nand antiquities, especially urns; among which is that of Minutius Felix;\r\na terminus that formerly stood in the Appian way, and a huge colossé of\r\nthe Emperor Justinian. There is a delicate aviary on the hill; the whole\r\ngardens furnished with rare collections, fresh, shady, and adorned with\r\nnoble fountains. Continuing our walk a mile farther, we came to Pons\r\nMilvius, now Mela, where Constantine overthrew Maxentius, and saw the\r\nmiraculous sign of the cross, _In hoc signo vinces_. It was a sweet\r\nmorning, and the bushes were full of nightingales. Hence, to Aqua Claudia\r\nagain, an aqueduct finished by that Emperor at the expense of eight\r\nmillions. In the afternoon, to Farnese's gardens, near the Campo\r\nVaccino; and upon the Palatine Mount to survey the ruins of Juno's\r\nTemple, in the Piscina, a piazza so-called near the famous bridge built\r\nby Antoninus Pius, and re-edified by Pope Sextus IV.\r\n\r\nThe rest of this week, we went to the Vatican, to hear the sermons, at\r\nSt. Peter's, of the most famous preachers, who discourse on the same\r\nsubjects and text yearly, full of Italian eloquence and action. On our\r\nLady day, 25th March, we saw the Pope and Cardinals ride in pomp to the\r\nMinerva, the great guns of the Castle of St. Angelo being fired, when he\r\ngives portions to 500 _zitelle_ (young women), who kiss his feet in\r\nprocession, some destined to marry, some to be nuns;--the scholars of the\r\ncollege celebrating the blessed Virgin with their compositions. The next\r\nday, his Holiness was busied in blessing golden roses, to be sent to\r\nseveral great Princes; the Procurator of the Carmelites preaching on our\r\nSavior's feeding the multitude with five loaves, the ceremony ends. The\r\nsacrament being this day exposed, and the relics of the Holy Cross, the\r\nconcourse about the streets is extraordinary. On Palm-Sunday, there was a\r\ngreat procession, after a papal mass.\r\n\r\n11th April, 1645. St. Veronica's handkerchief (with the impression of our\r\nSavior's face) was exposed, and the next day the spear, with a world of\r\nceremony. On Holy Thursday, the Pope said mass, and afterward carried the\r\nHost in procession about the chapel, with an infinity of tapers. This\r\nfinished, his Holiness was carried in his open chair on men's shoulders\r\nto the place where, reading the Bull _In Coenâ Domini_, he both curses\r\nand blesses all in a breath; then the guns are again fired. Hence, he\r\nwent to the Ducal hall of the Vatican, where he washed the feet of twelve\r\npoor men, with almost the same ceremony as it is done at Whitehall; they\r\nhave clothes, a dinner, and alms, which he gives with his own hands, and\r\nserves at their table; they have also gold and silver medals, but their\r\ngarments are of white woolen long robes, as we paint the Apostles. The\r\nsame ceremonies are done by the Conservators and other officers of state\r\nat St. John di Lateran; and now the table on which they say our blessed\r\nLord celebrated his last supper is set out, and the heads of the\r\nApostles. In every famous church they are busy in dressing up their\r\npageantries to represent the Holy Sepulchre, of which we went to visit\r\ndivers.\r\n\r\nOn Good Friday, we went again to St. Peter's, where the handkerchief,\r\nlance, and cross were all exposed, and worshiped together. All the\r\nconfession seats were filled with devout people, and at night was a\r\nprocession of several who most lamentably whipped themselves till the\r\nblood stained their clothes, for some had shirts, others upon the bare\r\nback, having visors and masks on their faces; at every three or four\r\nsteps dashing the knotted and raveled whip cord over their shoulders, as\r\nhard as they could lay it on; while some of the religious orders and\r\nfraternities sung in a dismal tone, the lights and crosses going before,\r\nmaking all together a horrible and indeed heathenish pomp.\r\n\r\nThe next day, there was much ceremony at St. John di Laterano, so as the\r\nwhole week was spent in running from church to church, all the town in\r\nbusy devotion, great silence, and unimaginable superstition.\r\n\r\nEaster day, I was awakened by the guns from St. Angelo: we went to St.\r\nPeter's, where the Pope himself celebrated mass, showed the relics\r\nbefore-named, and gave a public Benediction.\r\n\r\nMonday, we went to hear music in the Chiesa Nova; and, though there were\r\nabundance of ceremonies at the other great churches, and great exposure\r\nof relics, yet being wearied with sights of this nature, and the season\r\nof the year, summer, at Rome being very dangerous, by reason of the heat\r\nminding us of returning northward, we spent the rest of our time in\r\nvisiting such places as we had not yet sufficiently seen. Only I do not\r\nforget the Pope's benediction of the _Gonfalone_, or Standard, and giving\r\nthe hallowed palms; and, on May Day, the great procession of the\r\nUniversity and the muleteers at St. Anthony's, and their setting up a\r\nfoolish May pole in the Capitol, very ridiculous. We therefore now took\r\ncoach a little out of town, to visit the famous Roma Soterránea, being\r\nmuch like what we had seen at St. Sebastians. Here, in a cornfield,\r\nguided by two torches, we crept on our bellies into a little hole, about\r\ntwenty paces, which delivered us into a large entry that led us into\r\nseveral streets, or alleys, a good depth in the bowels of the earth, a\r\nstrange and fearful passage for divers miles, as Bosio has measured and\r\ndescribed them in his book. We ever and anon came into pretty square\r\nrooms, that seemed to be chapels with altars, and some adorned with very\r\nordinary ancient painting. Many skeletons and bodies are placed on the\r\nsides one above the other in degrees like shelves, whereof some are shut\r\nup with a coarse flat stone, having engraven on them _Pro Christo_, or a\r\ncross and palms, which are supposed to have been martyrs. Here, in all\r\nlikelihood, were the meetings of the Primitive Christians during the\r\npersecutions, as Pliny the Younger describes them. As I was prying about,\r\nI found a glass phial, filled (as was conjectured) with dried blood, and\r\ntwo lachrymatories. Many of the bodies, or rather bones (for there\r\nappeared nothing else) lay so entire, as if placed by the art of the\r\nchirurgeon, but being only touched fell all to dust. Thus, after\r\nwandering two or three miles in this subterranean meander, we returned\r\nalmost blind when we came into the daylight, and even choked by the smoke\r\nof the torches. It is said that a French bishop and his retinue\r\nadventuring too far into these dens, their lights going out, were never\r\nheard of more.\r\n\r\nWe were entertained at night with an English play at the Jesuits', where\r\nwe before had dined; and the next day at Prince Galicano's, who himself\r\ncomposed the music to a magnificent opera, where were present Cardinal\r\nPamphilio, the Pope's nephew, the Governors of Rome, the cardinals, the\r\nambassadors, ladies, and a number of nobility and strangers. There had\r\nbeen in the morning a joust and tournament of several young gentlemen on\r\na formal defy, to which we had been invited; the prizes being distributed\r\nby the ladies, after the knight-errantry way. The lancers and swordsmen\r\nrunning at tilt against the barriers, with a great deal of clatter, but\r\nwithout any bloodshed, giving much diversion to the spectators, and was\r\nnew to us travelers.\r\n\r\nThe next day Mr. Henshaw and I spent the morning in attending the\r\nentrance and cavalcade of Cardinal Medici, the ambassador from the Grand\r\nDuke of Florence, by the Via Flaminia. After dinner, we went again to the\r\nVilla Borghese, about a mile without the city; the garden is rather a\r\npark, or a Paradise, contrived and planted with walks and shades of\r\nmyrtles, cypress, and other trees, and groves, with abundance of\r\nfountains, statues, and bass-relievos, and several pretty murmuring\r\nrivulets. Here they had hung large nets to catch woodcocks. There was\r\nalso a vivary, where, among other exotic fowls, was an ostrich; besides a\r\nmost capacious aviary; and, in another inclosed part, a herd of deer.\r\nBefore the palace (which might become the court of a great prince) stands\r\na noble fountain, of white marble, enriched with statues. The outer walls\r\nof the house are encrusted with excellent antique bass-relievos, of the\r\nsame marble, incornished with festoons and niches set with statues from\r\nthe foundation to the roof. A stately portico joins the palace, full of\r\nstatues and columns of marble, urns, and other curiosities of sculpture.\r\nIn the first hall were the Twelve Cæsars, of antique marble, and the\r\nwhole apartments furnished with pictures of the most celebrated masters,\r\nand two rare tables of porphyry, of great value. But of this already: for\r\nI often visited this delicious place.\r\n\r\nThis night were glorious fire-works at the palace of Cardinal Medici\r\nbefore the gate, and lights of several colors all about the windows\r\nthrough the city, which they contrive by setting the candles in little\r\npaper lanterns dyed with various colors, placing hundreds of them from\r\nstory to story; which renders a gallant show.\r\n\r\n4th May, 1645. Having seen the entry of the ambassador of Lucca, I went\r\nto the Vatican, where, by favor of our Cardinal Protector, Fran.\r\nBarberini, I was admitted into the Consistory, heard the ambassador make\r\nhis oration in Latin to the Pope, sitting on an elevated state, or\r\nthrone, and changing two pontifical mitres; after which, I was presented\r\nto kiss his toe, that is, his embroidered slipper, two Cardinals holding\r\nup his vest and surplice; and then, being sufficiently blessed with his\r\nthumb and two fingers for that day I returned home to dinner.\r\n\r\nWe went again to see the medals of Signor Gotefredi, which are absolutely\r\nthe best collection in Rome.\r\n\r\nPassing the Ludovisia Villa, where the petrified human figure lies, found\r\non the snowy Alps; I measured the hydra, and found it not a foot long;\r\nthe three necks and fifteen heads seem to be but patched up with several\r\npieces of serpents' skins.\r\n\r\n5th May, 1645. We took coach, and went fifteen miles out of the city to\r\nFrascati, formerly Tusculum, a villa of Cardinal Aldobrandini, built for\r\na country house; but surpassing, in my opinion, the most delicious places\r\nI ever beheld for its situation, elegance, plentiful water, groves,\r\nascents, and prospects. Just behind the palace (which is of excellent\r\narchitecture) in the centre of the inclosure, rises a high hill, or\r\nmountain, all over clad with tall wood, and so formed by nature, as if it\r\nhad been cut out by art, from the summit whereof falls a cascade, seeming\r\nrather a great river than a stream precipitating into a large theatre of\r\nwater, representing an exact and perfect rainbow, when the sun shines\r\nout. Under this, is made an artificial grot, wherein are curious rocks,\r\nhydraulic organs, and all sorts of singing birds, moving and chirping by\r\nforce of the water, with several other pageants and surprising\r\ninventions. In the centre of one of these rooms, rises a copper ball that\r\ncontinually dances about three feet above the pavement, by virtue of a\r\nwind conveyed secretly to a hole beneath it; with many other devices to\r\nwet the unwary spectators, so that one can hardly step without wetting to\r\nthe skin. In one of these theaters of water, is an Atlas spouting up the\r\nstream to a very great height; and another monster makes a terrible\r\nroaring with a horn; but, above all, the representation of a storm is\r\nmost natural, with such fury of rain, wind, and thunder, as one would\r\nimagine oneself in some extreme tempest. The garden has excellent walks\r\nand shady groves, abundance of rare fruit, oranges, lemons, etc., and the\r\ngoodly prospect of Rome, above all description, so as I do not wonder\r\nthat Cicero and others have celebrated this place with such encomiums.\r\nThe Palace is indeed built more like a cabinet than anything composed of\r\nstone and mortar; it has in the middle a hall furnished with excellent\r\nmarbles and rare pictures, especially those of Gioseppino d'Arpino; the\r\nmovables are princely and rich. This was the last piece of architecture\r\nfinished by Giacomo della Porta, who built it for Pietro Cardinal\r\nAldobrandini, in the time of Clement VIII.[29]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 29: Cardinal Hippolito Aldobrandini was elected Pope in\r\n    January, 1592, by the name of Clement VIII., and died in March,\r\n    1605.]\r\n\r\nWe went hence to another house and garden not far distant, on the side of\r\na hill called Mondragone, finished by Cardinal Scipio Borghese, an ample\r\nand kingly edifice. It has a very long gallery, and at the end a theatre\r\nfor pastimes, spacious courts, rare grots, vineyards, olive-grounds,\r\ngroves and solitudes. The air is so fresh and sweet, as few parts of\r\nItaly exceed it; nor is it inferior to any palace in the city itself for\r\nstatues, pictures, and furniture; but, it growing late, we could not take\r\nsuch particular notice of these things as they deserved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TIVOLI]\r\n\r\n6th May, 1645. We rested ourselves; and next day, in a coach, took our\r\nlast farewell of visiting the circumjacent places, going to Tivoli, or\r\nthe old Tiburtum. At about six miles from Rome, we pass the Teverone, a\r\nbridge built by Mammea, the mother of Severus, and so by divers ancient\r\nsepulchres, among others that of Valerius Volusi; and near it past the\r\nstinking sulphurous river over the Ponte Lucano, where we found a heap, or\r\nturret, full of inscriptions, now called the Tomb of Plautius. Arrived at\r\nTivoli, we went first to see the palace d'Este, erected on a plain, but\r\nwhere was formerly an hill. The palace is very ample and stately. In the\r\ngarden, on the right hand, are sixteen vast conchas of marble, jetting\r\nout waters; in the midst of these stands a Janus quadrifrons, that cast\r\nforth four girandolas, called from the resemblance (to a particular\r\nexhibition in fireworks so named) the Fountana di Spéccho\r\n(looking-glass). Near this is a place for tilting. Before the ascent of\r\nthe palace is the famous fountain of Leda, and not far from that, four\r\nsweet and delicious gardens. Descending thence are two pyramids of water,\r\nand in a grove of trees near it the fountains of Tethys, Esculapius,\r\nArethusa, Pandora, Pomona, and Flora; then the prancing Pegasus, Bacchus,\r\nthe Grot of Venus, the two Colosses of Melicerta and Sibylla Tiburtina,\r\nall of exquisite marble, copper, and other suitable adornments. The\r\nCupids pouring out water are especially most rare, and the urns on which\r\nare placed the ten nymphs. The grots are richly paved with\r\n_pietra-commessa_, shells, coral, etc.\r\n\r\nToward Roma Triumphans, leads a long and spacious walk, full of\r\nfountains, under which is historized the whole Ovidian Metamorphosis, in\r\nrarely sculptured _mezzo relievo_. At the end of this, next the wall, is\r\nthe city of Rome as it was in its beauty, of small models, representing\r\nthat city, with its amphitheatres; naumachi, thermæ, temples, arches,\r\naqueducts, streets, and other magnificences, with a little stream running\r\nthrough it for the Tiber, gushing out of an urn next to the statue of the\r\nriver. In another garden, is a noble aviary, the birds artificial, and\r\nsinging till an owl appears, on which they suddenly change their notes.\r\nNear this is the fountain of dragons, casting out large streams of water\r\nwith great noise. In another grotto, called Grotto di Natura, is an\r\nhydraulic organ; and below this are divers stews and fish ponds, in one\r\nof which is the statue of Neptune in his chariot on a seahorse, in\r\nanother a Triton; and lastly, a garden of simples. There are besides in\r\nthe palace many rare statues and pictures, bedsteads richly inlaid, and\r\nsundry other precious movables: the whole is said to have cost the best\r\npart of a million.\r\n\r\nHaving gratified our curiosity with these artificial miracles, and dined,\r\nwe went to see the so famous natural precipice and cascade of the river\r\nAnio, rushing down from the mountains of Tivoli with that fury that, what\r\nwith the mist it perpetually casts up by the breaking of the water\r\nagainst the rocks, and what with the sun shining on it and forming a\r\nnatural Iris, and the prodigious depth of the gulf below, it is enough to\r\nastonish one that looks on it. Upon the summit of this rock stands the\r\nruins and some pillars and cornices of the Temple of Sibylla Tyburtina,\r\nor Albunea, a round fabric, still discovering some of its pristine\r\nbeauty. Here was a great deal of gunpowder drying in the sun, and a\r\nlittle beneath, mills belonging to the Pope.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROME]\r\n\r\nAnd now we returned to Rome. By the way, we were showed, at some\r\ndistance, the city Præneste, and the Hadrian villa, now only a heap of\r\nruins; and so came late to our lodging.\r\n\r\nWe now determined to desist from visiting any more curiosities, except\r\nwhat should happen to come in our way, when my companion, Mr. Henshaw, or\r\nmyself should go to take the air: only I may not omit that one afternoon,\r\ndiverting ourselves in the Piazza Navona, a mountebank there to allure\r\ncurious strangers, taking off a ring from his finger, which seemed set\r\nwith a dull, dark stone a little swelling out, like what we call (though\r\nuntruly) a toadstone, and wetting his finger a little in his mouth, and\r\nthen touching it, it emitted a luculent flame as bright and large as a\r\nsmall wax candle; then, blowing it out, repeated this several times. I\r\nhave much regretted that I did not purchase the receipt of him for making\r\nthat composition at what price soever; for though there is a process in\r\nJo. Baptista Porta and others how to do it, yet on several trials they\r\nnone of them have succeeded.\r\n\r\nAmong other observations I made in Rome are these: as to coins and\r\nmedals, ten _asses_ make the Roman _denarius_, five the _quinarius_, ten\r\n_denarii_ an _aureus_; which accompt runs almost exactly with what is now\r\nin use of _quatrini_, _baiocs_, _julios_, and _scudi_, each exceeding the\r\nother in the proportion of ten. The _sestertius_ was a small silver coin,\r\nmarked H. S. or rather LL^s, valued two pounds and a half of silver, viz,\r\n250 _denarii_, about twenty-five golden _ducati_. The stamp of the Roman\r\n_denarius_ varied, having sometimes a Janus bifrons, the head of Roma\r\narmed, or with a chariot and two horses, which were called _bigi_; if\r\nwith four, _quadrigi_: if with a Victoria, so named. The mark of the\r\n_denarius_ was distinguished > | < thus, or X; the _quinarius_ of half\r\nvalue, had, on one side, the head of Rome and V; the reverse, Castor and\r\nPollux on horseback, inscribed _Roma_, etc.\r\n\r\nI observed that in the Greek church they made the sign of the cross from\r\nthe right hand to the left; contrary to the Latins and the schismatic\r\nGreeks; gave the benediction with the first, second, and little finger\r\nstretched out, retaining the third bent down, expressing a distance of\r\nthe third Person of the Holy Trinity from the first two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _LORD WILLIAM RUSSELL TAKING LEAVE OF HIS CHILDREN, 1683_\r\n\r\n_Photogravure after a painting by Bridges_]\r\n\r\nFor sculptors and architects, we found Bernini and Algardi were in the\r\ngreatest esteem; Fiamingo, as a statuary; who made the Andrea in St.\r\nPeter's, and is said to have died mad because it was placed in an ill\r\nlight. Among the painters, Antonio de la Cornea, who has such an address\r\nof counterfeiting the hands of the ancient masters so well as to make his\r\ncopies pass for originals; Pietro de Cortone, Monsieur Poussin, a\r\nFrenchman, and innumerable more. Fioravanti, for armor, plate, dead life,\r\ntapestry, etc. The chief masters of music, after Marc Antonio, the best\r\ntreble, is Cavalier Lauretto, an eunuch; the next Cardinal Bichi's\r\neunuch, Bianchi, tenor, and Nicholai, bass. The Jews in Rome wore\r\nred hats, till the Cardinal of Lyons, being short-sighted, lately saluted\r\none of them, thinking him to be a Cardinal as he passed by his coach; on\r\nwhich an order was made, that they should use only the yellow color.\r\nThere was now at Rome one Mrs. Ward, an English devotée, who much\r\nsolicited for an order of Jesuitesses.\r\n\r\nAt executions I saw one, a gentleman, hanged in his cloak and hat for\r\nmurder. They struck the malefactor with a club that first stunned him,\r\nand then cut his throat. At Naples they use a frame, like ours at\r\nHalifax.[30]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30: A guillotine.]\r\n\r\nIt is reported that Rome has been once no less than fifty miles in\r\ncompass, now not thirteen, containing in it 3,000 churches and chapels,\r\nmonasteries, etc. It is divided into fourteen regions or wards; has seven\r\nmountains, and as many campi or valleys; in these are fair parks, or\r\ngardens, called villas, being only places of recess and pleasure, at some\r\ndistance from the streets, yet within the walls.\r\n\r\nThe bills of exchange I took up from my first entering Italy till I went\r\nfrom Rome, amounting to but 616 _ducati di banco_, though I purchased\r\nmany books, pictures, and curiosities.\r\n\r\n18th May, 1645. I intended to have seen Loretto, but, being disappointed\r\nof moneys long expected, I was forced to return by the same way I came,\r\ndesiring, if possible, to be at Venice by the Ascension, and therefore I\r\ndiverted to take Leghorn in the way, as well to furnish me with credit by\r\na merchant there, as to take order for transporting such collections as I\r\nhad made at Rome. When on my way, turning about to behold this once and\r\nyet glorious city, from an eminence, I did not, without some regret, give\r\nit my last farewell.\r\n\r\nHaving taken leave of our friends at Rome, where I had sojourned now\r\nabout seven months, autumn, winter, and spring, I took coach, in company\r\nwith two courteous Italian gentlemen. In the afternoon, we arrived at a\r\nhouse, or rather castle, belonging to the Duke of Parma, called\r\nCaprarola, situate on the brow of a hill, that overlooks a little town,\r\nor rather a natural and stupendous rock; witness those vast caves serving\r\nnow for cellarage, where we were entertained with most generous wine of\r\nseveral sorts, being just under the foundation. The palace was built by\r\nthe famous architect, Vignola, at the cost of Cardinal Alex. Farnese, in\r\nform of an octagon, the court in the middle being exactly round, so as\r\nrather to resemble a fort, or castle; yet the chambers within are all of\r\nthem square, which makes the walls exceedingly thick. One of these rooms\r\nis so artificially contrived, that from the two opposite angles may be\r\nheard the least whisper; they say any perfect square does it. Most of the\r\npaintings are by Zuccari. It has a stately entry, on which spouts an\r\nartificial fountain within the porch. The hall, chapel, and a great\r\nnumber of lodging chambers are remarkable; but most of all the pictures\r\nand witty inventions of Hannibal Caracci; the Dead Christ is\r\nincomparable. Behind are the gardens full of statues and noble fountains,\r\nespecially that of the Shepherds. After dinner, we took horse, and lay\r\nthat night at Monte Rossi, twenty miles from Rome.\r\n\r\n19th May, 1645. We dined at Viterbo, and lay at St. Laurenzo. Next day,\r\nat Radicofani, and slept at Turnera.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIENNA]\r\n\r\n21st May, 1645. We dined at Sienna, where we could not pass admiring the\r\ngreat church built entirely both within and without with white and black\r\nmarble in polished squares, by Macarino, showing so beautiful after a\r\nshower has fallen. The floor within is of various colored marbles,\r\nrepresenting the story of both Testaments, admirably wrought. Here lies\r\nPius II. The bibliotéca is painted by P. Perrugino and Raphael. The life\r\nof Æneas Sylvius is in FRESCO; in the middle are the Three Graces, in\r\nantique marble, very curious, and the front of this building, though\r\nGothic, is yet very fine. Among other things, they show St. Catharine's\r\ndisciplining cell, the door whereof is half cut out into chips by the\r\npilgrims and devotees, being of deal wood.\r\n\r\nSetting out hence for Pisa, we went again to see the Duomo in which the\r\nEmperor Henry VII. lies buried, poisoned by a monk in the Eucharist. The\r\nbending tower was built by Busqueto Delichio, a Grecian architect, and is\r\na stupendous piece of art. In the gallery of curiosities is a fair mummy;\r\nthe tail of a sea-horse; coral growing on a man's skull; a chariot\r\nautomaton; two pieces of rock crystal, in one of which is a drop of\r\nwater, in the other three or four small worms; two embalmed children;\r\ndivers petrifactions, etc. The garden of simples is well furnished, and\r\nhas in it the deadly yew, or _taxus_, of the ancients; which Dr.\r\nBelluccio, the superintendent, affirms that his workmen cannot endure to\r\nclip for above the space of half an hour at a time, from the pain of the\r\nhead which surprises them.\r\n\r\nWe went hence from Leghorn, by coach, where I took up ninety crowns for\r\nthe rest of my journey, with letters of credit for Venice, after I had\r\nsufficiently complained of my defeat of correspondence at Rome.\r\n\r\nThe next day, I came to Lucca, a small but pretty territory and state of\r\nitself. The city is neat and well fortified, with noble and pleasant\r\nwalks of trees on the works, where the gentry and ladies used to take the\r\nair. It is situate on an ample plain by the river Serchio, yet the\r\ncountry about it is hilly. The Senate-house is magnificent. The church of\r\nSt. Michael is a noble piece, as is also St. Fredian, more remarkable to\r\nus for the corpse of St. Richard, an English king,[31] who died here on\r\nhis pilgrimage toward Rome. This epitaph is on his tomb:\r\n\r\n    _Hic rex Richardus requiescit, sceptifer, almus;\r\n    Rex Fuit Anglorum; regnum tenet iste Polorum.\r\n    Regnum demisit; pro Christo cuncta reliquit.\r\n    Ergo, Richardum nobis debit Anglia sanctum.\r\n    Hic genitor Sanctæ Wulburgæ Virginis almæ\r\n    Est Vrillebaldi sancti simul et Vinebaldi,\r\n    Suffragium quorum nobis det regna Polorum._\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: What particular Richard King of England this was, it\r\n    is impossible to say; the tomb still exists, and has long been a\r\n    _crux_ to antiquaries and travelers.]\r\n\r\nNext this, we visited St. Croce, an excellent structure all of marble\r\nboth without and within, and so adorned as may vie with many of the\r\nfairest even in Rome: witness the huge cross, valued at £15,000, above\r\nall venerable for that sacred _volto_ which (as tradition goes) was\r\nmiraculously put on the image of Christ, and made by Nicodemus, while the\r\nartist, finishing the rest of the body, was meditating what face to set\r\non it. The inhabitants are exceedingly civil to strangers, above all\r\nplaces in Italy, and they speak the purest Italian. It is also cheap\r\nliving, which causes travelers to set up their rest here more than in\r\nFlorence, though a more celebrated city; besides, the ladies here are\r\nvery conversable, and the religious women not at all reserved; of these\r\nwe bought gloves and embroidered stomachers, generally worn by gentlemen\r\nin these countries. The circuit of this state is but two easy days'\r\njourney, and lies mixed with the Duke of Tuscany's but having Spain for a\r\nprotector (though the least bigoted of all Roman Catholics), and being\r\none of the fortified cities in Italy, it remains in peace. The whole\r\ncountry abounds in excellent olives, etc.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PISTORIA]\r\n\r\nGoing hence for Florence, we dined at Pistoria, where, besides one\r\nchurch, there was little observable: only in the highway we crossed a\r\nrivulet of salt water, though many miles from the sea. The country is\r\nextremely pleasant, full of gardens, and the roads straight as a line for\r\nthe best part of that whole day, the hedges planted with trees at equal\r\ndistances, watered with clear and plentiful streams.\r\n\r\nRising early the next morning we arrived at Peggio Imperiale, being a\r\npalace of the Great Duke, not far from the city, having omitted it in my\r\npassage to Rome. The ascent to the house is by a stately gallery as it\r\nwere of tall and overgrown cypress trees for near half a mile. At the\r\nentrance of these ranges, are placed statues of the Tiber and Arno, of\r\nmarble; those also of Virgil, Ovid, Petrarch, and Dante. The building is\r\nsumptuous, and curiously furnished within with cabinets of\r\npietra-commessa in tables, pavements, etc., which is a magnificence, or\r\nwork, particularly affected at Florence. The pictures are, Adam and Eve\r\nby Albert Durer, very excellent; as is that piece of carving in wood by\r\nthe same hand standing in a cupboard. Here is painted the whole Austrian\r\nline; the Duke's mother, sister to the Emperor, the foundress of this\r\npalace, than which there is none in Italy that I had seen more\r\nmagnificently adorned, or furnished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FLORENCE]\r\n\r\nWe could not omit in our passage to re-visit the same, and other\r\ncuriosities which we had neglected on our first being at Florence. We\r\nwent, therefore, to see the famous piece of Andrea del Sarto, in the\r\nAnnunciata. The story is, that the painter in a time of dearth borrowed a\r\nsack of corn of the religious of that convent, and repayment being\r\ndemanded, he wrought it out in this picture, which represents Joseph\r\nsitting on a sack of corn, and reading to the Blessed Virgin; a piece\r\ninfinitely valued. There fell down in the cloister an old man's face\r\npainted on the wall in _fresco_, greatly esteemed, and broke into crumbs;\r\nthe Duke sent his best painters to make another instead of it, but none\r\nof them would presume to touch a pencil where Andrea had wrought, like\r\nanother Apelles; but one of them was so industrious and patient, that,\r\npicking up the fragments, he laid and fastened them so artificially\r\ntogether, that the injury it had received was hardly discernible. Andrea\r\ndel Sarto lies buried in the same place. Here is also that picture of\r\nBartolomeo, who having spent his utmost skill in the face of the angel\r\nGabriel, and being troubled that he could not exceed it in the Virgin, he\r\nbegan the body and to finish the clothes, and so left it, minding in the\r\nmorning to work on the face; but, when he came, no sooner had he drawn\r\naway the cloth that was hung before it to preserve it from the dust, than\r\nan admirable and ravishing face was found ready painted; at which miracle\r\nall the city came in to worship. It is now kept in the Chapel of the\r\nSalutation, a place so enriched by devotees, that none in Italy, save\r\nLoretto, is said to exceed it. This picture is always covered with three\r\nshutters, one of which is of massy silver; methinks it is very brown, the\r\nforehead and cheeks whiter, as if it had been scraped. They report that\r\nthose who have the honor of seeing it never lose their sight--happy then\r\nwe! Belonging to this church is a world of plate, some whole statues of\r\nit, and lamps innumerable, besides the costly vows hung up, some of gold,\r\nand a cabinet of precious stones.\r\n\r\nVisiting the Duke's repository again, we told at least forty ranks of\r\nporphyry and other statues, and twenty-eight whole figures, many rare\r\npaintings and relievos, two square columns with trophies. In one of the\r\ngalleries, twenty-four figures, and fifty antique heads; a Bacchus of M.\r\nAngelo, and one of Bandinelli; a head of Bernini, and a most lovely\r\nCupid, of Parian marble; at the further end, two admirable women sitting,\r\nand a man fighting with a centaur; three figures in little of Andrea; a\r\nhuge candlestick of amber; a table of Titian's painting, and another\r\nrepresenting God the Father sitting in the air on the Four Evangelists;\r\nanimals; divers smaller pieces of Raphael; a piece of pure virgin gold,\r\nas big as an egg. In the third chamber of rarities is the square\r\ncabinet, valued at 80,000 crowns, showing on every front, a variety of\r\ncurious work; one of birds and flowers, of _pietra-commessa_; one, a\r\ndescent from the cross, of M. Angelo; on the third, our Blessed Savior\r\nand the Apostles, of amber; and, on the fourth, a crucifix of the same.\r\nBetween the pictures, two naked Venuses, by Titian; Adam and Eve, by\r\nDurer; and several pieces of Portdenone, and del Frate. There is a globe\r\nof six feet diameter. In the Armory, were an entire elk, a crocodile, and\r\namong the harness, several targets and antique horse-arms, as that of\r\nCharles V.; two set with turquoises, and other precious stones; a horse's\r\ntail, of a wonderful length. Then, passing the Old Palace, which has a\r\nvery great hall for feasts and comedies, the roof rarely painted, and the\r\nside walls with six very large pictures representing battles, the work of\r\nGio. Vassari. Here is a magazine full of plate; a harness of emeralds;\r\nthe furnitures of an altar four feet high, and six in length, of massy\r\ngold; in the middle is placed the statue of Cosmo II., the bass-relievo\r\nis of precious stones, his breeches covered with diamonds; the moldings\r\nof this statue, and other ornaments, festoons, etc., are garnished with\r\njewels and great pearls, dedicated to St. Charles, with this inscription,\r\nin rubies:\r\n\r\n    \"_Cosimus Secundus Dei gratiâ Magnus Dux Etruriæ ex voto._\"\r\n\r\nThere is also a King on horseback, of massy gold, two feet high, and an\r\ninfinity of such like rarities. Looking at the Justice, in copper, set up\r\non a column by Cosmo, in 1555, after the victory over Sienna, we were\r\ntold that the Duke, asking a gentleman how he liked the piece, he\r\nanswered, that he liked it very well, but that it stood too high for poor\r\nmen to come at it.\r\n\r\nPrince Leopold has, in this city, a very excellent collection of\r\npaintings, especially a St. Catherine of P. Veronese; a Venus of marble,\r\nveiled from the middle to the feet, esteemed to be of that Greek workman\r\nwho made the Venus at the Medici's Palace in Rome, altogether as good,\r\nand better preserved, an inestimable statue, not long since found about\r\nBologna.\r\n\r\nSignor Gaddi is a lettered person, and has divers rarities, statues, and\r\npictures of the best masters, and one bust of marble as much esteemed as\r\nthe most antique in Italy, and many curious manuscripts; his best\r\npaintings are, a Virgin of del Sarto, mentioned by Vassari, a St. John,\r\nby Raphael, and an _Ecce Homo_, by Titian.\r\n\r\nThe hall of the Academy de la Crusca is hung about with impresses and\r\ndevices painted, all of them relating to corn sifted from the bran; the\r\nseats are made like breadbaskets and other rustic instruments used about\r\nwheat, and the cushions of satin, like sacks.\r\n\r\nWe took our farewell of St. Laurence, more particularly noticing that\r\npiece of the Resurrection, which consists of a prodigious number of naked\r\nfigures, the work of Pontormo. On the left hand is the Martyrdom of St.\r\nLaurence, by Bronzino, rarely painted indeed. In a chapel is the tomb of\r\nPietro di Medici, and his brother John, of copper, excellently designed,\r\nstanding on two lions' feet, which end in foliage, the work of M. Angelo.\r\nOver against this, are sepulchres of all the ducal family. The altar has\r\na statue of the Virgin giving suck, and two Apostles. Paulus Jovius has\r\nthe honor to be buried in the cloister. Behind the choir is the superb\r\nchapel of Ferdinand I., consisting of eight faces, four plain, four a\r\nlittle hollowed; in the other are to be the sepulchres, and a niche of\r\nparagon, for the statue of the prince now living, all of copper gilt;\r\nabove, is a large table of porphyry, for an inscription for the Duke, in\r\nletters of jasper. The whole chapel, walls, pavement, and roof, are full\r\nof precious stones united with the moldings, which are also of gilded\r\ncopper, and so are the bases and capitals of the columns. The tabernacle,\r\nwith the whole altar, is inlaid with cornelians, lazuli, serpentine,\r\nagates, onyxes, etc. On the other side are six very large columns of rock\r\ncrystal, eight figures of precious stones of several colors, inlaid in\r\nnatural figures, not inferior to the best paintings, among which are many\r\npearls, diamonds, amethysts, topazes, sumptuous and sparkling beyond\r\ndescription. The windows without side are of white marble. The library is\r\nthe architecture of Raphael; before the port is a square vestibule of\r\nexcellent art, of all the orders, without confusion; the ascent to it\r\nfrom the library is excellent. We numbered eighty-eight shelves, all MSS.\r\nand bound in red, chained; in all about 3,500 volumes, as they told us.\r\n\r\nThe Arsenal has sufficient to arm 70,000 men, accurately preserved and\r\nkept, with divers lusty pieces of ordnance, whereof one is for a ball of\r\n300 pounds weight, and another for 160, which weighs 72,500 pounds.\r\n\r\nWhen I was at Florence, the celebrated masters were: for\r\n_pietra-commessa_ (a kind of mosaic, or inlaying, of various colored\r\nmarble, and other more precious stones), Dominico Benetti and Mazotti;\r\nthe best statuary, Vincentio Brochi. This statuary makes those small\r\nfigures in plaster and pasteboard, which so resemble copper that, till\r\none handles them, they cannot be distinguished, he has so rare an art of\r\nbronzing them; I bought four of him. The best painter, Pietro Beretino di\r\nCortona.\r\n\r\nThis Duke has a daily tribute for every courtezan, or prostitute, allowed\r\nto practice that infamous trade in his dominions, and so has his Holiness\r\nthe Pope, but not so much in value.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BOLOGNA]\r\n\r\nTaking leave of our two jolly companions, Signor Giovanni and his fellow,\r\nwe took horses for Bologna; and, by the way, alighted at a villa of the\r\nGrand Duke's, called Pratolino. The house is a square of four pavilions,\r\nwith a fair platform about it, balustred with stone, situate in a large\r\nmeadow, ascending like an amphitheater, having at the bottom a huge rock,\r\nwith water running in a small channel, like a cascade; on the other side,\r\nare the gardens. The whole place seems consecrated to pleasure and summer\r\nretirement. The inside of the palace may compare with any in Italy for\r\nfurniture of tapestry, beds, etc., and the gardens are delicious, and\r\nfull of fountains. In the grove sits Pan feeding his flock, the water\r\nmaking a melodious sound through his pipe; and a Hercules, whose club\r\nyields a shower of water, which, falling into a great shell, has a naked\r\nwoman riding on the backs of dolphins. In another grotto is Vulcan and\r\nhis family, the walls richly composed of corals, shells, copper, and\r\nmarble figures, with the hunting of several beasts, moving by the force\r\nof water. Here, having been well washed for our curiosity, we went down a\r\nlarge walk, at the sides whereof several slender streams of water gush\r\nout of pipes concealed underneath, that interchangeably fall into each\r\nother's channels, making a lofty and perfect arch, so that a man on\r\nhorseback may ride under it, and not receive one drop of wet. This\r\ncanopy, or arch of water, I thought one of the most surprising\r\nmagnificences I had ever seen, and very refreshing in the heat of the\r\nsummer. At the end of this very long walk, stands a woman in white\r\nmarble, in posture of a laundress wringing water out of a piece of linen,\r\nvery naturally formed, into a vast laver, the work and invention of M.\r\nAngelo Buonarotti. Hence, we ascended Mount Parnassus, where the Muses\r\nplayed to us on hydraulic organs. Near this is a great aviary. All these\r\nwaters came from the rock in the garden, on which is the statue of a\r\ngiant representing the Apennines, at the foot of which stands this villa.\r\nLast of all, we came to the labyrinth, in which a huge colosse of Jupiter\r\nthrows out a stream over the garden. This is fifty feet in height, having\r\nin his body a square chamber, his eyes and mouth serving for windows and\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nWe took horse and supped that night at Il Ponte, passing a dreadful ridge\r\nof the Apennines, in many places capped with snow, which covers them the\r\nwhole summer. We then descended into a luxurious and rich plain. The next\r\nday we passed through Scarperia, mounting the hills again, where the\r\npassage is so straight and precipitous toward the right hand, that we\r\nclimbed them with much care and danger; lodging at Firenzuolo, which is a\r\nfort built among the rocks, and defending the confines of the Great\r\nDuke's territories.\r\n\r\nThe next day we passed by the Pietramala, a burning mountain. At the\r\nsummit of this prodigious mass of hills, we had an unpleasant way to\r\nPianura, where we slept that night and were entertained with excellent\r\nwine. Hence to Scargalasino, and to bed at Loiano. This plain begins\r\nabout six miles from Bologna.\r\n\r\nBologna belongs to the Pope, and is a famous University, situate in one\r\nof the richest spots of Europe for all sorts of provisions. It is built\r\nlike a ship, whereof the Torre d'Asinelli may go for the mainmast. The\r\ncity is of no great strength, having a trifling wall about it, in circuit\r\nnear five miles, and two in length. This Torre d'Asinelli, ascended by\r\n447 steps of a foot rise, seems exceedingly high, is very narrow, and the\r\nmore conspicuous from another tower called Garisendi, so artificially\r\nbuilt of brick (which increases the wonder) that it seems ready to fall.\r\nIt is not now so high as the other; but they say the upper part was\r\nformerly taken down, for fear it should really fall, and do mischief.\r\n\r\nNext, we went to see an imperfect church, called St. Petronius, showing\r\nthe intent of the founder, had he gone on. From this, our guide led us to\r\nthe schools, which indeed are very magnificent. Thence to St. Dominic's,\r\nwhere that saint's body lies richly enshrined. The stalls, or seats, of\r\nthis goodly church have the history of the Bible inlaid with several\r\nwoods, very curiously done, the work of one Fr. Damiano di Bergamo, and a\r\nfriar of that order. Among other relics, they show the two books of\r\nEsdras, written with his own hand. Here lie buried Jac. Andreas, and\r\ndivers other learned persons. To the church joins the convent, in the\r\nquadrangle whereof are old cypresses, said to have been planted by their\r\nsaint.\r\n\r\nThen we went to the palace of the Legate; a fair brick building, as are\r\nmost of the houses and buildings, full of excellent carving and moldings,\r\nso as nothing in stone seems to be better finished or more ornamental;\r\nwitness those excellent columns to be seen in many of their churches,\r\nconvents, and public buildings; for the whole town is so cloistered, that\r\none may pass from house to house through the streets without being\r\nexposed either to rain or sun.\r\n\r\nBefore the stately hall of this palace stands the statue of Paul IV. and\r\ndivers others; also the monument of the coronation of Charles V. The\r\npiazza before it is the most stately in Italy, St. Mark's at Venice only\r\nexcepted. In the center of it is a fountain of Neptune, a noble figure in\r\ncopper. Here I saw a Persian walking about in a rich vest of cloth of\r\ntissue, and several other ornaments, according to the fashion of his\r\ncountry, which much pleased me; he was a young handsome person, of the\r\nmost stately mien.\r\n\r\nI would fain have seen the library of St. Savior, famous for the number\r\nof rare manuscripts; but could not, so we went to St. Francis, a glorious\r\npile, and exceedingly adorned within.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I inquired out a priest and Dr. Montalbano, to whom I\r\nbrought recommendations from Rome: this learned person invented, or found\r\nout, the composition of the _lapis illuminabilis_, or phosphorus. He\r\nshowed me their property (for he had several), being to retain the light\r\nof the sun for some competent time, by a kind of imbibition, by a\r\nparticular way of calcination. Some of these presented a blue color,\r\nlike the flame of brimstone, others like coals of a kitchen fire. The\r\nrest of the afternoon was taken up in St. Michael in Bosco, built on a\r\nsteep hill on the edge of the city, for its fabric, pleasant shade and\r\ngroves, cellars, dormitory, and prospects, one of the most delicious\r\nretirements I ever saw; art and nature contending which shall exceed; so\r\nas till now I never envied the life of a friar. The whole town and\r\ncountry to a vast extent are under command of their eyes, almost as far\r\nas Venice itself. In this convent there are many excellent paintings of\r\nGuido Reni; above all, the little cloister of eight faces, painted by\r\nCaracci in _fresco_. The carvings in wood, in the sacristy, are\r\nadmirable, as is the inlaid work about the chapel, which even emulates\r\nthe best paintings; the work is so delicate and tender. The paintings of\r\nthe Savior are of Caracci and Leonardo, and there are excellent things of\r\nRaphael which we could not see.\r\n\r\nIn the church of St. John is a fine piece of St. Cecilia, by Raphael. As\r\nto other paintings, there is in the church of St. Gregory an excellent\r\npicture of a Bishop giving the habit of St. Bernard to an armed soldier,\r\nwith several other figures in the piece, the work of Guerchino. Indeed,\r\nthis city is full of rare pieces, especially of Guido Domenico, and a\r\nvirgin named Isabella Sirani, now living, who has painted many excellent\r\npieces, and imitates Guido so well, that many skillful artists have been\r\ndeceived.\r\n\r\nAt the Mendicants are the Miracles of St. Eloy, by Reni, after the manner\r\nof Caravaggio, but better; and here they showed us that famous piece of\r\nChrist calling St. Matthew, by Annibal Caracci. The Marquis Magniani has\r\nthe whole frieze of his hall painted in _fresco_ by the same hand.\r\n\r\nMany of the religious men nourish those lapdogs which the ladies are so\r\nfond of, and which they here sell. They are a pigmy sort of spaniels,\r\nwhose noses they break when puppies; which, in my opinion, deforms them.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the turning in one of the wings of the dormitory of St.\r\nMichael, I found a paper pasted near the window, containing the\r\ndimensions of most of the famous churches in Italy compared with their\r\ntowers here, and the length of this gallery, a copy whereof I took.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+-------------+---------------+--------------\r\n                           | Braccia[32] |    Piede      |  Canna\r\n                           |             | di Bolognia|  | di Roma.\r\n  -------------------------+-------------+---------------+--------------\r\n                           |             |               |\r\n  St. Pietro di Roma, longo|    284      |      473      |   84\r\n  Cupalo del muro, alta    |    210      |      350      |   60\r\n  Torre d'Asinello, alto   |  208-4/5    |      348      |   59 pr.^{mi} 6\r\n  Dormitorio de St. Mich. a|             |               |\r\n    Bologn. longo          |    254      |      423      |   72-1/2\r\n  -------------------------+-----------+-----------------+--------------\r\n\r\n      [Footnote 32: A measure of half an ell.]\r\n\r\nFrom hence being brought to a subterranean territory of cellars, the\r\ncourteous friars made us taste a variety of excellent wines; and so we\r\ndeparted to our inn.\r\n\r\nThe city is famous also for sausages; and here is sold great quantities\r\nof Parmegiano cheese, with Botargo, Caviare, etc., which makes some of\r\ntheir shops perfume the streets with no agreeable smell. We furnished\r\nourselves with wash balls, the best being made here, and being a\r\nconsiderable commodity. This place has also been celebrated for lutes\r\nmade by the old masters, Mollen, Hans Frey, and Nicholas Sconvelt, which\r\nwere of extraordinary price; the workmen were chiefly Germans. The cattle\r\nused for draught in this country (which is very rich and fertile,\r\nespecially in pasturage) are covered with housings of linen fringed at\r\nthe bottom, that dangle about them, preserving them from flies, which in\r\nsummer are very troublesome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FERRARA]\r\n\r\nFrom this pleasant city, we proceeded toward Ferrara, carrying with us a\r\nbulletino, or bill of health (customary in all these parts of Italy,\r\nespecially in the State of Venice) and so put ourselves into a boat that\r\nwas towed with horses, often interrupted by the sluices (inventions there\r\nto raise the water for the use of mills, and to fill the artificial\r\ncanals) at each of which we stayed till passage was made. We went by the\r\nCastle Bentivoglio, and, about night arrived at an ugly inn called _Mal\r\nAlbergo_, agreeable to its name, whence, after we had supped, we embarked\r\nand passed that night through the Fens, where we were so pestered with\r\nthose flying glow-worms, called _Luccioli_, that one who had never heard\r\nof them, would think the country full of sparks of fire. Beating some of\r\nthem down and applying them to a book, I could read in the dark by the\r\nlight they afforded.\r\n\r\nQuitting our boat, we took coach, and by morning got to Ferrara, where,\r\nbefore we could gain entrance, our guns and arms were taken from us of\r\ncustom, the lock being taken off before, as we were advised. The city is\r\nin a low marshy country, and therefore well fortified. The houses and\r\nstreets have nothing of beauty, except the palace and church of St.\r\nBenedict, where Ariosto lies buried, and there are some good statues, the\r\npalazzo del Diamante, citadel, church of St. Dominico. The market-place\r\nis very spacious, having in its centre the figure of Nicholao Oläo once\r\nDuke of Ferrara, on horseback, in copper. It is, in a word, a dirty town,\r\nand, though the streets be large they remain ill paved; yet it is a\r\nUniversity and now belongs to the Pope. Though there are not many fine\r\nhouses in the city, the inn where we lodged was a very noble palace,\r\nhaving an Angel for its sign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VENICE]\r\n\r\nWe parted from hence about three in the afternoon, and went some of our\r\nway on the canal, and then embarked on the Po; or Padus; by the poets\r\ncalled Eridanus, where they feign Phæton to have fallen after his rash\r\nattempt, and where Io was metamorphosed into a cow. There was in our\r\ncompany, among others, a Polonian Bishop, who was exceeding civil to me\r\nin this passage, and afterward did me many kindnesses at Venice. We\r\nsupped this night at a place called Corbua, near the ruins of the ancient\r\ncity, Adria, which gives name to the Gulf, or Sea. After three miles,\r\nhaving passed thirty on the Po, we embarked in a stout vessel, and\r\nthrough an artificial canal, very straight, we entered the Adige, which\r\ncarried us by break of day into the Adriatic, and so sailing prosperously\r\nby Chioza (a town upon an island in this sea), and Palestina, we came\r\nover against Malamocco (the chief port and anchorage where our English\r\nmerchantmen lie that trade to Venice) about seven at night, after we had\r\nstayed at least two hours for permission to land, our bill of health\r\nbeing delivered, according to custom. So soon as we came on shore, we\r\nwere conducted to the Dogana, where our portmanteaus were visited, and\r\nthen we got to our lodging, which was at honest Signor Paulo Rhodomante's\r\nat the Black Eagle, near the Rialto, one of the best quarters of the\r\ntown. This journey from Rome to Venice cost me seven pistoles, and\r\nthirteen julios.\r\n\r\nJune, 1645. The next morning, finding myself extremely weary and beaten\r\nwith my journey, I went to one of their bagnios, where you are treated\r\nafter the eastern manner, washing with hot and cold water, with oils, and\r\nbeing rubbed with a kind of strigil of seal-skin, put on the operator's\r\nhand like a glove. This bath did so open my pores, that it cost me one of\r\nthe greatest colds I ever had in my life, for want of necessary caution\r\nin keeping myself warm for some time after; for, coming out, I\r\nimmediately began to visit the famous places of the city; and travelers\r\nwho come into Italy do nothing but run up and down to see sights, and\r\nthis city well deserved our admiration, being the most wonderfully placed\r\nof any in the world, built on so many hundred islands, in the very sea,\r\nand at good distance from the continent. It has no fresh water except\r\nwhat is reserved in cistern from rain, and such as is daily brought from\r\n_terra firma_ in boats, yet there was no want of it, and all sorts of\r\nexcellent provisions were very cheap.\r\n\r\nIt is said that when the Huns overran Italy, some mean fishermen and\r\nothers left the mainland, and fled for shelter to these despicable and\r\nmuddy islands, which, in process of time, by industry, are grown to the\r\ngreatness of one of the most considerable States, considered as a\r\nRepublic, and having now subsisted longer than any of the four ancient\r\nMonarchies, flourishing in great state, wealth, and glory, by the\r\nconquest of great territories in Italy, Dacia, Greece, Candia, Rhodes,\r\nand Sclavonia, and at present challenging the empire of all the Adriatic\r\nSea, which they yearly espouse by casting a gold ring into it with great\r\npomp and ceremony, on Ascension-day; the desire of seeing this was one of\r\nthe reasons that hastened us from Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Doge, having heard mass in his robes of state (which are very\r\nparticular, after the eastern fashion), together with the Senate in their\r\ngowns, embarked in their gloriously painted, carved, and gilded\r\nBucentora, environed and followed by innumerable galleys, gondolas, and\r\nboats, filled with spectators, some dressed in masquerade, trumpets,\r\nmusic, and cannons. Having rowed about a league into the Gulf, the Duke,\r\nat the prow, casts a gold ring and cup into the sea, at which a loud\r\nacclamation is echoed from the great guns of the Arsenal, and at the\r\nLiddo. We then returned.\r\n\r\nTwo days after, taking a gondola, which is their water-coach (for land\r\nones, there are many old men in this city who never saw one, or rarely a\r\nhorse), we rode up and down the channels, which answer to our streets.\r\nThese vessels are built very long and narrow, having necks and tails of\r\nsteel, somewhat spreading at the beak like a fish's tail, and kept so\r\nexceedingly polished as to give a great lustre; some are adorned with\r\ncarving, others lined with velvet (commonly black), with curtains and\r\ntassels, and the seats like couches, to lie stretched on, while he who\r\nrows, stands upright on the very edge of the boat, and, with one oar\r\nbending forward as if he would fall into the sea, rows and turns with\r\nincredible dexterity; thus passing from channel to channel, landing his\r\nfare, or patron, at what house he pleases. The beaks of these vessels are\r\nnot unlike the ancient Roman rostrums.\r\n\r\nThe first public building I went to see was the Rialto, a bridge of one\r\narch over the grand canal, so large as to admit a galley to row under it,\r\nbuilt of good marble, and having on it, besides many pretty shops, three\r\nample and stately passages for people without any inconvenience, the two\r\noutmost nobly balustered with the same stone; a piece of architecture\r\nmuch to be admired. It was evening, and the canal where the Noblesse go\r\nto take the air, as in our Hyde Park, was full of ladies and gentlemen.\r\nThere are many times dangerous stops, by reason of the multitude of\r\ngondolas ready to sink one another; and indeed they affect to lean them\r\non one side, that one who is not accustomed to it, would be afraid of\r\nover-setting. Here they were singing, playing on harpsichords, and other\r\nmusic, and serenading their mistresses; in another place, racing, and\r\nother pastimes on the water, it being now exceeding hot.\r\n\r\nNext day, I went to their Exchange, a place like ours, frequented by\r\nmerchants, but nothing so magnificent; from thence, my guide led me to\r\nthe Fondigo di Todeschi, which is their magazine, and here many of the\r\nmerchants, especially Germans, have their lodging and diet, as in a\r\ncollege. The outside of this stately fabric is painted by Giorgione da\r\nCastelfranco, and Titian himself.\r\n\r\nHence, I passed through the Mercera, one of the most delicious streets in\r\nthe world for the sweetness of it, and is all the way on both sides\r\ntapestried as it were with cloth of gold, rich damasks and other silks,\r\nwhich the shops expose and hang before their houses from the first floor,\r\nand with that variety that for near half the year spent chiefly in this\r\ncity, I hardly remember to have seen the same piece twice exposed; to\r\nthis add the perfumes, apothecaries' shops, and the innumerable cages of\r\nnightingales which they keep, that entertain you with their melody from\r\nshop to shop, so that shutting your eyes, you would imagine yourself in\r\nthe country, when indeed you are in the middle of the sea. It is almost\r\nas silent as the middle of a field, there being neither rattling of\r\ncoaches nor trampling of horses. This street, paved with brick, and\r\nexceedingly clean, brought us through an arch into the famous piazza of\r\nSt. Mark.\r\n\r\nOver this porch stands that admirable clock, celebrated, next to that of\r\nStrasburg, for its many movements; among which, about twelve and six,\r\nwhich are their hours of Ave Maria, when all the town are on their knees,\r\ncome forth the three Kings led by a star, and passing by the image of\r\nChrist in his Mother's arms, do their reverence, and enter into the clock\r\nby another door. At the top of this turret, another automaton strikes the\r\nquarters. An honest merchant told me that one day walking in the piazza,\r\nhe saw the fellow who kept the clock struck with this hammer so forcibly,\r\nas he was stooping his head near the bell, to mend something amiss at the\r\ninstant of striking, that being stunned, he reeled over the battlements,\r\nand broke his neck. The buildings in this piazza are all arched, on\r\npillars, paved within with black and white polished marble, even to the\r\nshops, the rest of the fabric as stately as any in Europe, being not only\r\nmarble, but the architecture is of the famous Sansovini, who lies buried\r\nin St. Jacomo, at the end of the piazza. The battlements of this noble\r\nrange of buildings, are railed with stone, and thick-set with excellent\r\nstatues, which add a great ornament. One of the sides is yet much more\r\nRoman-like than the other which regards the sea, and where the church is\r\nplaced. The other range is plainly Gothic; and so we entered into St.\r\nMark's Church, before which stand two brass pedestals exquisitely cast\r\nand figured, which bear as many tall masts painted red, on which, upon\r\ngreat festivals, they hang flags and streamers. The church is also\r\nGothic; yet for the preciousness of the materials, being of several rich\r\nmarbles, abundance of porphyry, serpentine, etc., far exceeding any in\r\nRome, St. Peter's hardly excepted. I much admired the splendid history of\r\nour blessed Savior, composed all of Mosaic over the _facciata_, below\r\nwhich and over the four chief gates are cast four horses in copper as big\r\nas the life, the same that formerly were transported from Rome by\r\nConstantine to Byzantium, and thence by the Venetians hither.[33] They\r\nare supported by eight porphyry columns, of very great size and value.\r\nBeing come into the church, you see nothing, and tread on nothing, but\r\nwhat is precious. The floor is all inlaid with agates, lazulis,\r\nchalcedons, jaspers, porphyries, and other rich marbles, admirable also\r\nfor the work; the walls sumptuously incrusted, and presenting to the\r\nimagination the shapes of men, birds, houses, flowers, and a thousand\r\nvarieties. The roof is of most excellent Mosaic; but what most persons\r\nadmire is the new work of the emblematic tree at the other passage out of\r\nthe church. In the midst of this rich _volto_ rise five cupolas, the\r\nmiddle very large and sustained by thirty-six marble columns, eight of\r\nwhich are of precious marbles: under these cupolas is the high altar, on\r\nwhich is a reliquary of several sorts of jewels, engraven with figures,\r\nafter the Greek manner, and set together with plates of pure gold. The\r\naltar is covered with a canopy of ophite, on which is sculptured the\r\nstory of the Bible, and so on the pillars, which are of Parian marble,\r\nthat support it. Behind these, are four other columns of transparent and\r\ntrue Oriental alabaster, brought hither out of the mines of Solomon's\r\nTemple, as they report. There are many chapels and notable monuments of\r\nillustrious persons, dukes, cardinals, etc., as Zeno, J. Soranzi, and\r\nothers: there is likewise a vast baptistry, of copper. Among other\r\nvenerable relics is a stone, on which they say our blessed Lord stood\r\npreaching to those of Tyre and Sidon, and near the door is an image of\r\nChrist, much adorned, esteeming it very sacred, for that a rude fellow\r\nstriking it they say, there gushed out a torrent of blood. In one of the\r\ncorners lies the body of St. Isidore, brought hither 500 years since from\r\nthe island of Chios. A little farther, they show the picture of St.\r\nDominic and Francis, affirmed to have been made by the Abbot Joachim\r\n(many years before any of them were born). Going out of the church, they\r\nshowed us the stone where Alexander III. trod on the neck of the Emperor\r\nFrederick Barbarossa, pronouncing that verse of the psalm, \"_super\r\nbasiliscum_,\" etc. The doors of the church are of massy copper. There are\r\nnear 500 pillars in this building, most of them porphyry and serpentine,\r\nand brought chiefly from Athens, and other parts of Greece, formerly in\r\ntheir power. At the corner of the church, are inserted into the main wall\r\nfour figures, as big as life, cut in porphyry; which they say are the\r\nimages of four brothers who poisoned one another, by which means were\r\nescheated to the Republic that vast treasury of relics now belonging to\r\nthe church. At the other entrance that looks toward the sea, stands in a\r\nsmall chapel that statue of our Lady, made (as they affirm) of the same\r\nstone, or rock, out of which Moses brought water to the murmuring\r\nIsraelites at Horeb, or Meriba.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 33: They were taken away by Bonaparte to Paris; but in\r\n    1815, were sent back to Venice.]\r\n\r\nAfter all that is said, this church is, in my opinion, much too dark and\r\ndismal, and of heavy work; the fabric,--as is much of Venice, both for\r\nbuildings and other fashions and circumstances,--after the Greeks, their\r\nnext neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe next day, by favor of the French ambassador, I had admittance with\r\nhim to view the Reliquary, called here Tesoro di San Marco, which very\r\nfew, even of travelers, are admitted to see. It is a large chamber full\r\nof presses. There are twelve breastplates or pieces of pure golden armor,\r\nstudded with precious stones, and as many crowns dedicated to St. Mark,\r\nby so many noble Venetians, who had recovered their wives taken at sea by\r\nthe Saracens; many curious vases of agates; the cap, or coronet, of the\r\nDukes of Venice, one of which had a ruby set on it, esteemed worth\r\n200,000 crowns; two unicorns' horns; numerous vases and dishes of agate,\r\nset thick with precious stones and vast pearls; divers heads of Saints\r\nenchased in gold; a small ampulla, or glass, with our Savior's blood; a\r\ngreat morsel of the real cross; one of the nails; a thorn; a fragment of\r\nthe column to which our Lord was bound, when scourged; the standard or\r\nensign, of Constantine; a piece of St. Luke's arm; a rib of St. Stephen;\r\na finger of Mary Magdalen; numerous other things, which I could not\r\nremember. But a priest, first vesting himself in his sacerdotals, with\r\nthe stole about his neck, showed us the gospel of St. Mark (their tutelar\r\npatron) written by his own hand, and whose body they show buried in the\r\nchurch, brought hither from Alexandria many years ago.\r\n\r\nThe Religious de li Servi have fine paintings of Paolo Veronese,\r\nespecially the Magdalen.\r\n\r\nA French gentleman and myself went to the Courts of Justice, the Senate\r\nHouse, and Ducal Palace. The first court near this church is almost\r\nwholly built of several colored sorts of marble, like checkerwork on the\r\noutside; this is sustained by vast pillars, not very shapely, but\r\nobservable for their capitals, and that out of thirty-three no two are\r\nalike. Under this fabric is the cloister where merchants meet morning and\r\nevening, as also the grave senators and gentlemen, to confer of state\r\naffairs, in their gowns and caps, like so many philosophers; it is a very\r\nnoble and solemn spectacle. In another quadrangle, stood two square\r\ncolumns of white marble, carved, which they said had been erected to hang\r\none of their Dukes on, who designed to make himself Sovereign. Going\r\nthrough a stately arch, there were standing in niches divers statues of\r\ngreat value, among which is the so celebrated Eve, esteemed worth its\r\nweight in gold; it is just opposite to the stairs where are two\r\nColossuses of Mars and Neptune, by Sansovino. We went up into a Corridor\r\nbuilt with several Tribunals and Courts of Justice; and by a\r\nwell-contrived staircase were landed in the Senate hall, which appears to\r\nbe one of the most noble and spacious rooms in Europe, being seventy-six\r\npaces long, and thirty-two in breadth. At the upper end, are the\r\nTribunals of the Doge, Council of Ten, and Assistants: in the body of the\r\nhall, are lower ranks of seats, capable of containing 1,500 Senators; for\r\nthey consist of no fewer on grand debates. Over the Duke's throne are the\r\npaintings of the Final Judgment, by Tintoret, esteemed among the best\r\npieces in Europe. On the roof are the famous Acts of the Republic,\r\npainted by several excellent masters, especially Bassano; next them, are\r\nthe effigies of the several Dukes, with their Elogies. Then, we turned\r\ninto a great Court painted with the Battle of Lepanto, an excellent\r\npiece; afterward, into the Chamber of the Council of Ten, painted by the\r\nmost celebrated masters. From hence, by the special favor of an\r\nIllustrissimo, we were carried to see the private Armory of the Palace,\r\nand so to the same court we first entered, nobly built of polished white\r\nmarble, part of which is the Duke's Court, _pro tempore_; there are two\r\nwells adorned with excellent work in copper. This led us to the seaside,\r\nwhere stand those columns of ophite stone in the entire piece, of a great\r\nheight, one bearing St. Mark's Lion, the other St. Theodorus: these\r\npillars were brought from Greece, and set up by Nicholas Baraterius, the\r\narchitect; between them public executions are performed.\r\n\r\nHaving fed our eyes with the noble prospect of the Island of St. George,\r\nthe galleys, gondolas, and other vessels passing to and fro, we walked\r\nunder the cloister on the other side of this goodly piazza, being a most\r\nmagnificent building, the design of Sansovino. Here we went into the\r\n_Zecca_, or mint; at the entrance, stand two prodigious giants, or\r\nHercules, of white marble; we saw them melt, beat, and coin silver, gold,\r\nand copper. We then went up into the Procuratory, and a library of\r\nexcellent MSS. and books belonging to it and the public. After this, we\r\nclimbed up the tower of St. Mark, which we might have done on horseback,\r\nas it is said one of the French Kings did; there being no stairs, or\r\nsteps, but returns that take up an entire square on the arches forty\r\nfeet, broad enough for a coach. This steeple stands by itself, without\r\nany church near it, and is rather a watch tower in the corner of the\r\ngreat piazza, 230 feet in height, the foundation exceeding deep; on the\r\ntop, is an angel, that turns with the wind; and from hence is a prospect\r\ndown the Adriatic, as far as Istria and the Dalmatian side, with the\r\nsurprising sight of this miraculous city, lying in the bosom of the sea,\r\nin the shape of a lute, the numberless islands tacked together by no\r\nfewer than 450 bridges. At the foot of this tower, is a public tribunal\r\nof excellent work, in white marble polished, adorned with several brass\r\nstatues and figures of stone and mezzo-relievo, the performance of some\r\nrare artist.\r\n\r\nIt was now Ascension-week, and the great mart, or fair, of the whole year\r\nwas kept, everybody at liberty and jolly; the noblemen stalking with\r\ntheir ladies on _choppines_. These are high-heeled shoes, particularly\r\naffected by these proud dames, or, as some say, invented to keep them at\r\nhome, it being very difficult to walk with them; whence, one being asked\r\nhow he liked the Venetian dames, replied, they were \"_mezzo carne, mezzo\r\nlegno_,\" half flesh, half wood, and he would have none of them. The truth\r\nis, their garb is very odd, as seeming always in masquerade; their other\r\nhabits also totally different from all nations. They wear very long,\r\ncrisp hair, of several streaks and colors, which they make so by a wash,\r\ndisheveling it on the brims of a broad hat that has no crown, but a hole\r\nto put out their heads by; they dry them in the sun, as one may see them\r\nat their windows. In their tire, they set silk flowers and sparkling\r\nstones, their petticoats coming from their very arm-pits, so that they\r\nare near three quarters and a half apron; their sleeves are made\r\nexceedingly wide, under which their shift-sleeves as wide, and commonly\r\ntucked up to the shoulder, showing their naked arms, through false\r\nsleeves of tiffany, girt with a bracelet or two, with knots of point\r\nrichly tagged about their shoulders and other places of their body, which\r\nthey usually cover with a kind of yellow veil of lawn, very transparent.\r\nThus attired, they set their hands on the heads of two matron-like\r\nservants, or old women, to support them, who are mumbling their beads. It\r\nis ridiculous to see how these ladies crawl in and out of their gondolas,\r\nby reason of their _choppines_; and what dwarfs they appear, when taken\r\ndown from their wooden scaffolds; of these I saw near thirty together,\r\nstalking half as high again as the rest of the world. For courtesans, or\r\nthe citizens, may not wear _choppines_, but cover their bodies and faces\r\nwith a veil of a certain glittering taffeta, or lustrée, out of which\r\nthey now and then dart a glance of their eye, the whole face being\r\notherwise entirely hid with it: nor may the common misses take this\r\nhabit; but go abroad barefaced. To the corner of these virgin-veils hang\r\nbroad but flat tassels of curious Point de Venice. The married women go\r\nin black veils. The nobility wear the same color, but a fine cloth lined\r\nwith taffeta, in summer, with fur of the bellies of squirrels, in the\r\nwinter, which all put on at a certain day, girt with a girdle embossed\r\nwith silver, the vest not much different from what our Bachelors of Arts\r\nwear in Oxford, and a hood of cloth, made like a sack, cast over their\r\nleft shoulder, and a round cloth black cap fringed with wool, which is\r\nnot so comely; they also wear their collar open, to show the diamond\r\nbutton of the stock of their shirt. I have never seen pearls for color\r\nand bigness comparable to what the ladies wear, most of the noble\r\nfamilies being very rich in jewels, especially pearls, which are always\r\nleft to the son, or brother who is destined to marry; which the eldest\r\nseldom do. The Doge's vest is of crimson velvet, the Procurator's, etc.\r\nof damask, very stately. Nor was I less surprised with the strange\r\nvariety of the several nations seen every day in the streets and piazzas;\r\nJews, Turks, Armenians, Persians, Moors, Greeks, Sclavonians, some with\r\ntheir targets and bucklers, and all in their native fashions, negotiating\r\nin this famous Emporium, which is always crowded with strangers.\r\n\r\nThis night, having with my Lord Bruce taken our places before we went to\r\nthe Opera, where comedies and other plays are represented in recitative\r\nmusic, by the most excellent musicians, vocal and instrumental, with\r\nvariety of scenes painted and contrived with no less art of perspective,\r\nand machines for flying in the air, and other wonderful notions; taken\r\ntogether, it is one of the most magnificent and expensive diversions the\r\nwit of man can invent. The history was, Hercules in Lydia; the scenes\r\nchanged thirteen times. The famous voices, Anna Rencia, a Roman, and\r\nreputed the best treble of women; but there was an eunuch who, in my\r\nopinion, surpassed her; also a Genoese that sung an incomparable bass.\r\nThis held us by the eyes and ears till two in the morning, when we went\r\nto the Chetto de san Felice, to see the noblemen and their ladies at\r\nbasset, a game at cards which is much used; but they play not in public,\r\nand all that have inclination to it are in masquerade, without speaking\r\none word, and so they come in, play, lose or gain, and go away as they\r\nplease. This time of license is only in carnival and this Ascension-week;\r\nneither are their theatres open for that other magnificence, or for\r\nordinary comedians, save on these solemnities, they being a frugal and\r\nwise people, and exact observers of all sumptuary laws.\r\n\r\nThere being at this time a ship bound for the Holy Land, I had resolved\r\nto embark, intending to see Jerusalem, and other parts of Syria, Egypt\r\nand Turkey; but after I had provided all necessaries, laid in snow to\r\ncool our drink, bought some sheep, poultry, biscuit, spirits, and a\r\nlittle cabinet of drugs in case of sickness, our vessel (whereof Captain\r\nPowell was master), happened to be pressed for the service of the State,\r\nto carry provisions to Candia, now newly attacked by the Turks; which\r\naltogether frustrated my design, to my great mortification.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PADUA]\r\n\r\nOn the ... of June, we went to Padua, to the fair of their St. Anthony,\r\nin company of divers passengers. The first _terra firma_ we landed at was\r\nFusina, being only an inn where we changed our barge, and were then drawn\r\nup by horses through the river Brenta, a straight channel as even as a\r\nline for twenty miles, the country on both sides deliciously adorned with\r\ncountry villas and gentlemen's retirements, gardens planted with oranges,\r\nfigs, and other fruit, belonging to the Venetians. At one of these villas\r\nwe went ashore to see a pretty contrived palace. Observable in this\r\npassage was buying their water of those who farm the sluices; for this\r\nartificial river is in some places so shallow, that reserves of water are\r\nkept with sluices, which they open and shut with a most ingenious\r\ninvention, or engine, governed even by a child. Thus they keep up the\r\nwater, or let it go, till the next channel be either filled by the stop,\r\nor abated to the level of the other; for which every boat pays a certain\r\nduty. Thus, we stayed near half an hour and more, at three several\r\nplaces, so as it was evening before we got to Padua. This is a very\r\nancient city, if the tradition of Antenor's, being the founder, be not a\r\nfiction; but thus speaks the inscription over a stately gate:\r\n\r\n    \"_Hanc antiquissimam urbem literarum omnium asylum, cujus agrum\r\n    fertilitatis Lumen Natura esse voluit, Antenor condidit, anno ante\r\n    Christum natum M. Cxviii; Senatus autem Venetus his belli\r\n    propugnaculis ornavit._\"\r\n\r\nThe town stands on the river Padus, whence its name, and is generally\r\nbuilt like Bologna, on arches and on brick, so that one may walk all\r\naround it, dry, and in the shade; which is very convenient in these hot\r\ncountries, and I think I was never sensible of so burning a heat as I\r\nwas this season, especially the next day, which was that of the fair,\r\nfilled with noble Venetians, by reason of a great and solemn procession\r\nto their famous cathedral. Passing by St. Lorenzo, I met with this\r\nsubscription:\r\n\r\n    \"_Inclytus Antenor patriam vox nisa quietem\r\n      Transtulit huc Henetum Dardanidumq; fuga,\r\n    Expulit Euganeos, Patavinam condidit urbem,\r\n      Quem tegit hic humili marmore cæsa domus._\"\r\n\r\nUnder the tomb, was a cobbler at his work. Being now come to St. Antony's\r\n(the street most of the way straight, well built, and outside excellently\r\npainted in _fresco_), we surveyed the spacious piazza, in which is\r\nerected a noble statue of copper of a man on horseback, in memory of one\r\nCatta Malata, a renowned captain. The church, _à la Greca_, consists of\r\nfive handsome cupolas, leaded. At the left hand within is the tomb of St.\r\nAntony and his altar, about which a mezzo-relievo of the miracles\r\nascribed to him is exquisitely wrought in white marble by the three\r\nfamous sculptors, Tullius Lombardus, Jacobus Sansovinus, and Hieronymus\r\nCompagno. A little higher is the choir, walled parapet-fashion, with\r\nsundry colored stone, half relievo, the work of Andrea Reccij. The altar\r\nwithin is of the same metal, which, with the candlestick and bases, is,\r\nin my opinion, as magnificent as any in Italy. The wainscot of the choir\r\nis rarely inlaid and carved. Here are the sepulchres of many famous\r\npersons, as of Rodolphus Fulgosi, etc.; and among the rest, one for an\r\nexploit at sea, has a galley exquisitely carved thereon. The procession\r\nbore the banners with all the treasure of the cloister, which was a very\r\nfine sight.\r\n\r\nHence, walking over the Prato delle Valle, I went to see the convent of\r\nSt. Justina, than which I never beheld one more magnificent. The church\r\nis an excellent piece of architecture, of Andrea Palladio, richly paved,\r\nwith a stately cupola that covers the high altar enshrining the ashes of\r\nthat saint. It is of _pietra-commessa_, consisting of flowers very\r\nnaturally done. The choir is inlaid with several sorts of wood\r\nrepresenting the holy history, finished with exceeding industry. At the\r\nfar end, is that rare painting of St. Justina's Martyrdom, by Paolo\r\nVeronese; and a stone on which they told us divers primitive Christians\r\nhad been decapitated. In another place (to which leads a small cloister\r\nwell painted) is a dry well, covered with a brass-work grate, wherein are\r\nthe bones of divers martyrs. They show also the bones of St. Luke, in an\r\nold alabaster coffin; three of the Holy Innocents; and the bodies of St.\r\nMaximus and Prosdocimus.[34] The dormitory above is exceedingly\r\ncommodious and stately; but what most pleased me, was the old cloister so\r\nwell painted with the legendary saints, mingled with many ancient\r\ninscriptions, and pieces of urns dug up, it seems, at the foundation of\r\nthe church. Thus, having spent the day in rambles, I returned the next\r\nday to Venice.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 34: St. Peter's disciple, first Bishop of Padua.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VENICE]\r\n\r\nThe arsenal is thought to be one of the best furnished in the world. We\r\nentered by a strong port, always guarded, and, ascending a spacious\r\ngallery, saw arms of back, breast, and head, for many thousands; in\r\nanother were saddles; over them, ensigns taken from the Turks. Another\r\nhall is for the meeting of the Senate; passing a graff, are the smiths'\r\nforges, where they are continually employed on anchors and iron work.\r\nNear it is a well of fresh water, which they impute to two rhinoceros's\r\nhorns which they say lie in it, and will preserve it from ever being\r\nempoisoned. Then we came to where the carpenters were building their\r\nmagazines of oars, masts, etc., for an hundred galleys and ships, which\r\nhave all their apparel and furniture near them. Then the foundry, where\r\nthey cast ordnance; the forge is 450 paces long, and one of them has\r\nthirteen furnaces. There is one cannon, weighing 16,573 pounds, cast\r\nwhile Henry the Third dined, and put into a galley built, rigged, and\r\nfitted for launching within that time. They have also arms for twelve\r\ngaleasses, which are vessels to row, of almost 150 feet long, and thirty\r\nwide, not counting prow or poop, and contain twenty-eight banks of oars,\r\neach seven men, and to carry 1,300 men, with three masts. In another, a\r\nmagazine for fifty galleys, and place for some hundreds more. Here stands\r\nthe Bucentaur, with a most ample deck, and so contrived that the slaves\r\nare not seen, having on the poop a throne for the Doge to sit, when he\r\ngoes in triumph to espouse the Adriatic. Here is also a gallery of 200\r\nyards long for cables, and above that a magazine of hemp. Opposite these,\r\nare the saltpetre houses, and a large row of cells, or houses, to\r\nprotect their galleys from the weather. Over the gate, as we go out, is a\r\nroom full of great and small guns, some of which discharge six times at\r\nonce. Then, there is a court full of cannon, bullets, chains, grapples,\r\ngrenadoes, etc., and over that arms for 800,000 men, and by themselves\r\narms for 400, taken from some that were in a plot against the state;\r\ntogether with weapons of offense and defense for sixty-two ships;\r\nthirty-two pieces of ordnance, on carriages taken from the Turks, and one\r\nprodigious mortar-piece. In a word, it is not to be reckoned up what this\r\nlarge place contains of this sort. There were now twenty-three galleys,\r\nand four galley-grossi, of 100 oars to a side. The whole arsenal is\r\nwalled about, and may be in compass about three miles, with twelve towers\r\nfor the watch, besides that the sea environs it. The workmen, who are\r\nordinarily 500, march out in military order, and every evening receive\r\ntheir pay through a small hole in the gate where the governor lives.\r\n\r\nThe next day, I saw a wretch executed, who had murdered his master, for\r\nwhich he had his head chopped off by an ax that slid down a frame of\r\ntimber, between the two tall columns in St. Mark's piazza, at the\r\nsea-brink; the executioner striking on the ax with a beetle; and so the\r\nhead fell off the block.\r\n\r\nHence, by Gudala, we went to see Grimani's Palace, the portico whereof is\r\nexcellent work. Indeed, the world cannot show a city of more stately\r\nbuildings, considering the extent of it, all of square stone, and as\r\nchargeable in their foundations as superstructure, being all built on\r\npiles at an immense cost. We returned home by the church of St. Johanne\r\nand Paulo, before which is, in copper, the statue of Bartolomeo Colone,\r\non horseback, double gilt, on a stately pedestal, the work of Andrea\r\nVerrochio, a Florentine. This is a very fine church, and has in it many\r\nrare altarpieces of the best masters, especially that on the left hand,\r\nof the Two Friars slain, which is of Titian.\r\n\r\nThe day after, being Sunday, I went over to St. George's to the ceremony\r\nof the schismatic Greeks, who are permitted to have their church, though\r\nthey are at defiance with Rome. They allow no carved images, but many\r\npainted, especially the story of their patron and his dragon. Their rites\r\ndiffer not much from the Latins, save that of communicating in both\r\nspecies, and distribution of the holy bread. We afterward fell into a\r\ndispute with a Candiot, concerning the procession of the Holy Ghost. The\r\nchurch is a noble fabric.\r\n\r\nThe church of St. Zachary is a Greek building, by Leo IV., Emperor, and\r\nhas in it the bones of that prophet, with divers other saints. Near this,\r\nwe visited St. Luke's, famous for the tomb of Aretin.\r\n\r\nTuesday, we visited several other churches, as Santa Maria, newly\r\nincrusted with marble on the outside, and adorned with porphyry, ophite,\r\nand Spartan stone. Near the altar and under the organ, are sculptures,\r\nthat are said to be of the famous artist Praxiteles. To that of St. Paul\r\nI went purposely, to see the tomb of Titian. Then to St. John the\r\nEvangelist, where among other heroes, lies Andrea Baldarius, the inventor\r\nof oars applied to great vessels for fighting.\r\n\r\nWe also saw St. Roche, the roof whereof is, with the school, or hall, of\r\nthat rich confraternity, admirably painted by Tintoretto, especially the\r\nCrucifix in the _sacristia_. We saw also the church of St. Sebastian, and\r\nCarmelites' monastery.\r\n\r\nNext day, taking our gondola at St. Mark's, I passed to the island of St.\r\nGeorge Maggiore, where is a Convent of Benedictines, and a well-built\r\nchurch of Andrea Palladio, the great architect. The pavement, cupola,\r\nchoir, and pictures, very rich and sumptuous. The cloister has a fine\r\ngarden to it, which is a rare thing at Venice, though this is an island a\r\nlittle distant from the city; it has also an olive orchard, all environed\r\nby the sea. The new cloister now building has a noble staircase paved\r\nwith white and black marble.\r\n\r\nFrom hence, we visited St. Spirito, and St. Laurence, fair churches in\r\nseveral islands; but most remarkable is that of the Padri Olivetani, in\r\nSt. Helen's island, for the rare paintings and carvings, with inlaid\r\nwork, etc.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PADUA]\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we went again to Padua, where, on the following day, we\r\nvisited the market, which is plentifully furnished, and exceedingly\r\ncheap. Here we saw the great hall, built in a spacious piazza, and one of\r\nthe most magnificent in Europe; its ascent is by steps a good height, of\r\na reddish marble polished, much used in these parts, and happily found\r\nnot far off; it is almost 200 paces long, and forty in breadth, all\r\ncovered with lead, without any support of columns. At the further end\r\nstands the bust, in white marble, of Titus Livius, the historian. In this\r\ntown is the house wherein he was born, full of inscriptions, and pretty\r\nfair.\r\n\r\nNear to the monument of Speron Speroni, is painted on the ceiling the\r\ncelestial zodiac, and other astronomical figures; without side, there is\r\na corridor, in manner of a balcony, of the same stone; and at the entry\r\nof each of the three gates is the head of some famous person, as Albert\r\nEremitano, Julio Paullo (lawyers), and Peter Aponius. In the piazza is\r\nthe Podesta's and Capitano Grande's Palace, well built; but above all,\r\nthe Monte Pietà, the front whereof is of most excellent architecture.\r\nThis is a foundation of which there is one in most of the cities in\r\nItaly, where there is a continual bank of money to assist the poorer\r\nsort, on any pawn, and at reasonable interest, together with magazines\r\nfor deposit of goods, till redeemed.\r\n\r\nHence, to the Schools of this flourishing and ancient University,\r\nespecially for the study of physic and anatomy. They are fairly built in\r\nquadrangle, with cloisters beneath, and above with columns. Over the\r\ngreat gate are the arms of the Venetian State, and under the lion of St.\r\nMark.\r\n\r\n    _Sic ingredere, ut teipso quotidie doctior; sic egredere ut indies\r\n    Patriæ Christianæq; Republicæ utilior evadas; ita demùm Gymnasium à\r\n    te felicitèr se ornatum existimabit._\r\n\r\n                              CIC.IX.\r\n\r\nAbout the court walls, are carved in stone and painted the blazons of the\r\nConsuls of all the nations, that from time to time have had that charge\r\nand honor in the University, which at my being there was my worthy friend\r\nDr. Rogers, who here took that degree.\r\n\r\nThe Schools for the lectures of the several sciences are above, but none\r\nof them comparable, or so much frequented, as the theater for anatomy,\r\nwhich is excellently contrived both for the dissector and spectators. I\r\nwas this day invited to dinner, and in the afternoon (30th July) received\r\nmy _matricula_, being resolved to spend some months here at study,\r\nespecially physic and anatomy, of both which there were now the most\r\nfamous professors in Europe. My _matricula_ contained a clause, that I,\r\nmy goods, servants, and messengers, should be free from all tolls and\r\nreprises, and that we might come, pass, return, buy, or sell, without any\r\ntoll, etc.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, I saw the garden of simples, rarely furnished with\r\nplants, and gave order to the gardener to make me a collection of them\r\nfor an _hortus hyemalis_, by permission of the Cavalier Dr. Veslingius,\r\nthen Prefect and Botanic Professor as well as of Anatomy.\r\n\r\nThis morning, the Earl of Arundel,[35] now in this city, a famous\r\ncollector of paintings and antiquities, invited me to go with him to see\r\nthe garden of Mantua, where, as one enters, stands a huge _colosse_ of\r\nHercules. From hence to a place where was a room covered with a noble\r\ncupola, built purposely for music; the fillings up, or cove, between the\r\nwalls, were of urns and earthen pots, for the better sounding; it was\r\nalso well painted. After dinner, we walked to the Palace of Foscari all'\r\nArena, there remaining yet some appearances of an ancient theater, though\r\nserving now for a court only before the house. There were now kept in it\r\ntwo eagles, a crane, a Mauritanian sheep, a stag, and sundry fowls, as in\r\na vivary.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 35: The celebrated Thomas, Earl of Arundel, part of whose\r\n    collection was eventually procured for the University of Oxford by\r\n    Evelyn, and is distinguished by the name _Marmora Arundeliana_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VENICE]\r\n\r\nThree days after, I returned to Venice, and passed over to Murano, famous\r\nfor the best glasses in the world, where having viewed their furnaces,\r\nand seen their work, I made a collection of divers curiosities and\r\nglasses, which I sent for England by long sea. It is the white flints\r\nthey have from Pavia, which they pound and sift exceedingly small, and\r\nmix with ashes made of a seaweed brought out of Syria, and a white sand,\r\nthat causes this manufacture to excel. The town is a Podestaria by\r\nitself, at some miles distant on the sea from Venice, and like it, built\r\non several small islands. In this place, are excellent oysters, small and\r\nwell tasted like our Colchester, and they were the first, as I remember,\r\nthat I ever could eat; for I had naturally an aversion to them.\r\n\r\nAt our return to Venice, we met several gondolas full of Venetian ladies,\r\nwho come thus far in fine weather to take the air, with music and other\r\nrefreshments. Besides that, Murano is itself a very nobly built town, and\r\nhas divers noblemen's palaces in it, and handsome gardens.\r\n\r\nIn coming back, we saw the islands of St. Christopher and St. Michael,\r\nthe last of which has a church enriched and incrusted with marbles and\r\nother architectonic ornaments, which the monks very courteously showed\r\nus. It was built and founded by Margaret Emiliana of Verona, a famous\r\ncourtesan, who purchased a great estate, and by this foundation hoped to\r\ncommute for her sins. We then rowed by the isles of St. Nicholas, whose\r\nchurch, with the monuments of the Justinian family, entertained us\r\nawhile; and then got home.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, Captain Powell, in whose ship I was to embark toward\r\nTurkey, invited me on board, lying about ten miles from Venice, where we\r\nhad a dinner of English powdered beef and other good meat, with store of\r\nwine and great guns, as the manner is. After dinner, the Captain\r\npresented me with a stone he had lately brought from Grand Cairo, which\r\nhe took from the mummy-pits, full of hieroglyphics; I drew it on paper\r\nwith the true dimensions, and sent it in a letter to Mr. Henshaw to\r\ncommunicate to Father Kircher, who was then setting forth his great work\r\n\"Obeliscus Pamphilius,\" where it is described, but without mentioning my\r\nname. The stone was afterward brought for me into England, and landed at\r\nWapping, where, before I could hear of it, it was broken into several\r\nfragments, and utterly defaced, to my no small disappointment.\r\n\r\nThe boatswain of the ship also gave me a hand and foot of a mummy, the\r\nnails whereof had been overlaid with thin plates of gold, and the whole\r\nbody was perfect, when he brought it out of Egypt; but the avarice of the\r\nship's crew broke it to pieces, and divided the body among them. He\r\npresented me also with two Egyptian idols, and some loaves of the bread\r\nwhich the Coptics use in the Holy Sacrament, with other curiosities.\r\n\r\n8th August, 1645. I had news from Padua of my election to be _Syndicus\r\nArtistarum_, which caused me, after two days idling in a country villa\r\nwith the Consul of Venice, to hasten thither, that I might discharge\r\nmyself of that honor, because it was not only chargeable, but would have\r\nhindered my progress, and they chose a Dutch gentleman in my place,\r\nwhich did not well please my countrymen, who had labored not a little to\r\ndo me the greatest honor a stranger is capable of in that University.\r\nBeing freed from this impediment, and having taken leave of Dr. Janicius,\r\na Polonian, who was going as physician in the Venetian galleys to Candia,\r\nI went again to Venice, and made a collection of several books and some\r\ntoys. Three days after, I returned to Padua, where I studied hard till\r\nthe arrival of Mr. Henshaw, Bramstone, and some other English gentlemen\r\nwhom I had left at Rome, and who made me go back to Venice, where I spent\r\nsome time in showing them what I had seen there.\r\n\r\n26th September, 1645. My dear friend, and till now my constant\r\nfellow-traveler, Mr. Thicknesse, being obliged to return to England upon\r\nhis particular concern, and who had served his Majesty in the wars, I\r\naccompanied him part of his way, and, on the 28th, returned to Venice.\r\n\r\n29th September, 1645. Michaelmas day, I went with my Lord Mowbray (eldest\r\nson to the Earl of Arundel, and a most worthy person) to see the\r\ncollection of a noble Venetian, Signor Rugini. He has a stately palace,\r\nrichly furnished with statues and heads of Roman Emperors, all placed in\r\nan ample room. In the next, was a cabinet of medals, both Latin and\r\nGreek, with divers curious shells and two fair pearls in two of them;\r\nbut, above all, he abounded in things petrified, walnuts, eggs in which\r\nthe yoke rattled, a pear, a piece of beef with the bones in it, a whole\r\nhedgehog, a plaice on a wooden trencher turned into stone and very\r\nperfect, charcoal, a morsel of cork yet retaining its levity, sponges,\r\nand a piece of taffety part rolled up, with innumerable more. In another\r\ncabinet, supported by twelve pillars of oriental agate, and railed about\r\nwith crystal, he showed us several noble intáglios of agate, especially a\r\nhead of Tiberius, a woman in a bath with her dog, some rare cornelians,\r\nonyxes, crystals, etc., in one of which was a drop of water not\r\ncongealed, but moving up and down, when shaken; above all, a diamond\r\nwhich had a very fair ruby growing in it; divers pieces of amber, wherein\r\nwere several insects, in particular one cut like a heart that contained\r\nin it a salamander without the least defect, and many pieces of mosaic.\r\nThe fabric of this cabinet was very ingenious, set thick with agates,\r\nturquoises, and other precious stones, in the midst of which was an\r\nantique of a dog in stone scratching his ear, very rarely cut, and\r\ncomparable to the greatest curiosity I had ever seen of that kind for the\r\naccurateness of the work. The next chamber had a bedstead all inlaid with\r\nagates, crystals, cornelians, lazuli, etc., esteemed worth 16,000 crowns,\r\nbut, for the most part, the bedsteads in Italy are of forged iron gilded,\r\nsince it is impossible to keep the wooden ones from the cimices.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PADUA]\r\n\r\nFrom hence, I returned to Padua, when that town was so infested with\r\nsoldiers, that many houses were broken open in the night, some murders\r\ncommitted, and the nuns next our lodging disturbed, so as we were forced\r\nto be on our guard with pistols and other firearms to defend our doors;\r\nand indeed the students themselves take a barbarous liberty in the\r\nevenings when they go to their strumpets, to stop all that pass by the\r\nhouse where any of their companions in folly are with them. This custom\r\nthey call _chi vali_, so as the streets are very dangerous, when the\r\nevenings grow dark; nor is it easy to reform this intolerable usage,\r\nwhere there are so many strangers of several nations.\r\n\r\nUsing to drink my wine cooled with snow and ice, as the manner here is, I\r\nwas so afflicted with an angina and sore throat, that it had almost cost\r\nme my life. After all the remedies Cavalier Veslingius, chief professor\r\nhere, could apply, old Salvatico (that famous physician) being called,\r\nmade me be cupped, and scarified in the back in four places; which began\r\nto give me breath, and consequently life; for I was in the utmost danger;\r\nbut, God being merciful to me, I was after a fortnight abroad again,\r\nwhen, changing my lodging, I went over against Pozzo Pinto; where I\r\nbought for winter provision 3,000 weight of excellent grapes, and pressed\r\nmy own wine, which proved incomparable liquor.\r\n\r\nThis was on 10th of October. Soon after came to visit me from Venice Mr.\r\nHenry Howard, grandchild to the Earl of Arundel, Mr. Bramstone, son to\r\nthe Lord Chief Justice, and Mr. Henshaw, with whom I went to another part\r\nof the city to lodge near St. Catherine's over against the monastery of\r\nnuns, where we hired the whole house, and lived very nobly. Here I\r\nlearned to play on the theorb, taught by Signor Dominico Bassano, who\r\nhad a daughter married to a doctor of laws, that played and sung to nine\r\nseveral instruments, with that skill and address as few masters in Italy\r\nexceeded her; she likewise composed divers excellent pieces: I had never\r\nseen any play on the Naples viol before. She presented me afterward with\r\ntwo recitativos of hers, both words and music.\r\n\r\n31st October, 1645. Being my birthday, the nuns of St. Catherine's sent\r\nme flowers of silkwork. We were very studious all this winter till\r\nChristmas, when on Twelfth-day, we invited all the English and Scots in\r\ntown to a feast, which sunk our excellent wine considerably.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VENICE]\r\n\r\n1645-46. In January, Signor Molino was chosen Doge of Venice, but the\r\nextreme snow that fell, and the cold, hindered my going to see the\r\nsolemnity, so as I stirred not from Padua till Shrovetide, when all the\r\nworld repair to Venice, to see the folly and madness of the Carnival; the\r\nwomen, men, and persons of all conditions disguising themselves in\r\nantique dresses, with extravagant music and a thousand gambols,\r\ntraversing the streets from house to house, all places being then\r\naccessible and free to enter. Abroad, they fling eggs filled with sweet\r\nwater, but sometimes not over-sweet. They also have a barbarous custom of\r\nhunting bulls about the streets and piazzas, which is very dangerous, the\r\npassages being generally narrow. The youth of the several wards and\r\nparishes contend in other masteries and pastimes, so that it is\r\nimpossible to recount the universal madness of this place during this\r\ntime of license. The great banks are set up for those who will play at\r\nbassett; the comedians have liberty, and the operas are open; witty\r\npasquils are thrown about, and the mountebanks have their stages at every\r\ncorner. The diversions which chiefly took me up was three noble operas,\r\nwhere were excellent voices and music, the most celebrated of which was\r\nthe famous Anna Rencia, whom we invited to a fish dinner after four days\r\nin Lent, when they had given over at the theater. Accompanied with an\r\neunuch whom she brought with her, she entertained us with rare music,\r\nboth of them singing to a harpsichord. It growing late, a gentleman of\r\nVenice came for her, to show her the galleys, now ready to sail for\r\nCandia. This entertainment produced a second, given us by the English\r\nconsul of the merchants, inviting us to his house, where he had the\r\nGenoese, the most celebrated bass in Italy, who was one of the late opera\r\nband. This diversion held us so late at night, that, conveying a\r\ngentlewoman who had supped with us to her gondola at the usual place of\r\nlanding, we were shot at by two carbines from another gondola, in which\r\nwere a noble Venetian and his courtesan unwilling to be disturbed, which\r\nmade us run in and fetch other weapons, not knowing what the matter was,\r\ntill we were informed of the danger we might incur by pursuing it\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\nThree days after this, I took my leave of Venice, and went to Padua, to\r\nbe present at the famous anatomy lecture, celebrated here with\r\nextraordinary apparatus, lasting almost a whole month. During this time,\r\nI saw a woman, a child, and a man dissected with all the manual\r\noperations of the chirurgeon on the human body. The one was performed by\r\nCavalier Veslingius and Dr. Jo. Athelsteninus Leonoenas, of whom I\r\npurchased those rare tables of veins and nerves, and caused him to\r\nprepare a third of the lungs, liver, and nervi _sexti par_: with the\r\ngastric veins, which I sent into England, and afterward presented to the\r\nRoyal Society, being the first of that kind that had been seen there,\r\nand, for aught I know, in the world, though afterward there were others.\r\nWhen the anatomy lectures, which were in the mornings, were ended, I went\r\nto see cures done in the hospitals; and certainly as there are the\r\ngreatest helps and the most skillful physicians, so there are the most\r\nmiserable and deplorable objects to exercise upon. Nor is there any, I\r\nshould think, so powerful an argument against the vice reigning in this\r\nlicentious country, as to be spectator of the misery these poor creatures\r\nundergo. They are indeed very carefully attended, and with extraordinary\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\n20th March, 1646. I returned to Venice, where I took leave of my friends.\r\n\r\n22d March, 1646. I was invited to excellent English potted venison, at\r\nMr. Hobbson's, a worthy merchant.\r\n\r\n23d March, 1646. I took my leave of the Patriarch and the Prince of\r\nWirtemberg, and Monsieur Grotius (son of the learned Hugo) now going as\r\ncommander to Candia; and, in the afternoon, received of Vandervoort, my\r\nmerchant, my bills of exchange of 300 ducats for my journey. He showed me\r\nhis rare collection of Italian books, esteemed very curious, and of good\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThe next day, I was conducted to the Ghetto, where the Jews dwell\r\ntogether in as a tribe or ward, where I was present at a marriage. The\r\nbride was clad in white, sitting in a lofty chair, and covered with a\r\nwhite veil; then two old Rabbis joined them together, one of them holding\r\na glass of wine in his hand, which, in the midst of the ceremony,\r\npretending to deliver to the woman, he let fall, the breaking whereof was\r\nto signify the frailty of our nature, and that we must expect disasters\r\nand crosses amid all enjoyments. This done we had a fine banquet, and\r\nwere brought into the bride-chamber, where the bed was dressed up with\r\nflowers, and the counterpane strewn in works. At this ceremony, we saw\r\ndivers very beautiful Portuguese Jewesses, with whom we had some\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nI went to the Spanish Ambassador with Bonifacio, his confessor, and\r\nobtained his pass to serve me in the Spanish dominions; without which I\r\nwas not to travel, in this pompous form:\r\n\r\n    \"_Don Caspar de Teves y Guzman, Marques de la Fuente, Señor Le\r\n    Lerena y Verazuza, Commendador de Colos, en la Orden de Sant Yago,\r\n    Alcalde Mayor perpetuo y Escrivano Mayor de la Ciudad de Sevilla,\r\n    Gentilhombre de la Camara de S.

I took my leave of him in his bed, where I left that great and\r\nexcellent man in tears on some private discourse of crosses that had\r\nbefallen his illustrious family, particularly the undutifulness of his\r\ngrandson Philip turning Dominican Friar (since Cardinal of Norfolk), and\r\nthe misery of his country now embroiled in civil war. He caused his\r\ngentleman to give me directions, all written with his own hand, what\r\ncuriosities I should inquire after in my journey; and, so enjoining me to\r\nwrite sometimes to him, I departed. There stayed for me below, Mr. Henry\r\nHoward (afterward Duke of Norfolk), Mr. J. Digby, son of Sir Kenelm\r\nDigby, and other gentlemen, who conducted me to the coach.\r\n\r\nThe famous lapidaries of Venice for false stones and pastes, so as to\r\nemulate the best diamonds, rubies, etc., were Marco Terrasso and Gilbert.\r\n\r\n    An account of what Bills of Exchange I took up at Venice since my\r\n    coming from Rome, till my departure from Padua:\r\n\r\n        11th Aug., 1645      200\r\n        7th Sept.            135\r\n        1st Oct.             100\r\n        15th Jan., 1646      100\r\n        23d April            300\r\n                             ---\r\n                             835 Ducati di Banco.\r\n\r\nIn company, then, with Mr. Waller, one Captain Wray (son of Sir\r\nChristopher, whose father had been in arms against his Majesty, and\r\ntherefore by no means welcome to us), with Mr. Abdy, a modest and learned\r\nman, we got that night to Vicenza, passing by the Euganéan hills,\r\ncelebrated for the prospects and furniture of rare simples, which we\r\nfound growing about them. The ways were something deep, the whole country\r\nflat and even as a bowling-green. The common fields lie square, and are\r\norderly planted with fruit trees, which the vines run and embrace, for\r\nmany miles, with delicious streams creeping along the ranges.\r\n\r\nVicenza is a city in the Marquisate of Treviso, yet appertaining to the\r\nVenetians, full of gentlemen and splendid palaces, to which the famous\r\nPalladio, born here, has exceedingly contributed, having been the\r\narchitect. Most conspicuous is the Hall of Justice; it has a tower of\r\nexcellent work; the lower pillars are of the first order; those in the\r\nthree upper corridors are Doric; under them, are shops in a spacious\r\npiazza. The hall was built in imitation of that at Padua, but of a nobler\r\ndesign, _à la moderne_. The next morning, we visited the theater, as\r\nbeing of that kind the most perfect now standing, and built by Palladio,\r\nin exact imitation of the ancient Romans, and capable of containing 5,000\r\nspectators. The scene, which is all of stone, represents an imperial\r\ncity, the order Corinthian, decorated with statues. Over the Scenario is\r\ninscribed: \"_Virtuti ac Genio Olympior: Academia Theatrum hoc à\r\nfundamentis erexit Palladio Architect: 1584_.\" The scene declines eleven\r\nfeet, the _soffito_ painted with clouds. To this there joins a spacious\r\nhall for solemn days to ballot in, and a second for the Academics. In the\r\npiazza is also the _podesta_, or governor's house, the _facciata_ being\r\nof the Corinthian order, very noble. The piazza itself is so large as to\r\nbe capable of jousts and tournaments, the nobility of this city being\r\nexceedingly addicted to this knight-errantry, and other martial\r\ndiversions. In this place are two pillars in imitation of those at St.\r\nMark's at Venice, bearing one of them a winged lion, the other the statue\r\nof St. John the Baptist.\r\n\r\nIn a word, this sweet town has more well-built palaces than any of its\r\ndimensions in all Italy, besides a number begun and not yet finished (but\r\nof stately design) by reason of the domestic dissensions between them and\r\nthose of Brescia, fomented by the sage Venetians, lest by combining, they\r\nmight think of recovering their ancient liberty. For this reason, also,\r\nare permitted those disorders and insolences committed at Padua among the\r\nyouth of these two territories. It is no dishonor in this country to be\r\nsome generations in finishing their palaces, that without exhausting\r\nthemselves by a vast expense at once, they may at last erect a sumptuous\r\npile. Count Oleine's Palace is near perfected in this manner. Count\r\nUlmarini is more famous for his gardens, being without the walls,\r\nespecially his _cedrario_, or conserve of oranges, eleven score of my\r\npaces long, set in order and ranges, making a canopy all the way by their\r\nintermixing branches for more than 200 of my single paces, and which\r\nbeing full of fruit and blossoms, was a most delicious sight. In the\r\nmiddle of this garden, was a cupola made of wire, supported by slender\r\npillars of brick, so closely covered with ivy, both without and within,\r\nthat nothing was to be perceived but green; between the arches there\r\ndangled festoons of the same. Here is likewise a most inextricable\r\nlabyrinth.\r\n\r\nI had in this town recommendation to a very civil and ingenious\r\napothecary, called Angelico, who had a pretty collection of paintings. I\r\nwould fain have visited a palace, called the Rotunda, which was a mile\r\nout of town, belonging to Count Martio Capra; but one of our companions\r\nhastening to be gone, and little minding anything save drinking and\r\nfolly, caused us to take coach sooner than we should have done.\r\n\r\nA little from the town, we passed the Campo Martio, set out in imitation\r\nof ancient Rome, wherein the nobles exercised their horses, and the\r\nladies make the Corso; it is entered by a stately triumphal arch, the\r\ninvention of Palladio.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VERONA]\r\n\r\nBeing now set out for Verona, about midway we dined at Ostaria Nova, and\r\ncame late to our resting-place, which was the Cavaletto, just over the\r\nmonument of the Scalageri,[36] formerly princes of Verona, adorned with\r\nmany devices in stone of ladders, alluding to the name.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36: Or della Scala.]\r\n\r\nEarly next morning, we went about the city, which is built on the gentle\r\ndeclivity, and bottom of a hill, environed in part with some considerable\r\nmountains and downs of fine grass, like some places in the south of\r\nEngland, and, on the other side, having the rich plain where Caius Marius\r\noverthrew the Cimbrians. The city is divided in the midst by the river\r\nAdige, over which are divers stately bridges, and on its banks are many\r\ngoodly palaces, whereof one is well painted in _chiaro-oscuro_ on the\r\noutside, as are divers in this dry climate of Italy.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that engaged our attention and wonder, too, was the\r\namphitheater, which is the most entire of ancient remains now extant. The\r\ninhabitants call it the ARENA: it has two porticos, one within the other,\r\nand is thirty-four rods long, twenty-two in breadth, with forty-two ranks\r\nof stone benches, or seats, which reach to the top. The vastness of the\r\nmarble stones is stupendous. \"_L. V. Flaminius, Consul. anno. urb. con.\r\nliii._\" This I esteem to be one of the noblest antiquities in Europe, it\r\nis so vast and entire, having escaped the ruins of so many other public\r\nbuildings for above 1,400 years.\r\n\r\nThere are other arches, as that of the victory of Marius; temples,\r\naqueducts, etc., showing still considerable remains in several places of\r\nthe town, and how magnificent it has formerly been. It has three strong\r\ncastles and a large and noble wall. Indeed, the whole city is bravely\r\nbuilt, especially the Senate house, where we saw those celebrated statues\r\nof Cornelius Nepos, Æmilius Marcus, Plinius, and Vitruvius, all having\r\nhonored Verona by their birth; and, of later date, Julius Cæsar Scaliger,\r\nthat prodigy of learning.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we saw the garden of Count Giusti's villa where are walks\r\ncut out of the main rock, from whence we had a pleasant prospect of\r\nMantua and Parma, though at great distance. At the entrance of this\r\ngarden, grows the goodliest cypress, I fancy, in Europe, cut in a\r\npyramid; it is a prodigious tree both for breadth and height, entirely\r\ncovered, and thick to the base.\r\n\r\nDr. Cortone, a civilian, showed us, among other rarities, a St. Dorothea,\r\nof Raphael. We could not see the rare drawings, especially of Parmensis,\r\nbelonging to Dr. Marcello, another advocate, on account of his absence.\r\n\r\nVerona deserved all those elogies Scaliger has honored it with; for in my\r\nopinion, the situation is the most delightful I ever saw, it is so\r\nsweetly mixed with rising ground and valleys, so elegantly planted with\r\ntrees on which Bacchus seems riding as it were in triumph every autumn,\r\nfor the vines reach from tree to tree; here, of all places I have seen in\r\nItaly, would I fix a residence. Well has that learned man given it the\r\nname of the very eye of the world:\r\n\r\n    \"_Oscelle mundi, Sidus Itali coeli,\r\n    Flos Urbium, flos cornicuumq' amoenum,\r\n    Quot sunt, eruntve, quot fuere, Verona._\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning we traveled over the downs where Marius fought and\r\nfancied ourselves about Winchester, and the country toward Dorsetshire.\r\nWe dined at an inn called Cavalli Caschieri, near Peschiera, a very\r\nstrong fort of the Venetian Republic, and near the Lago di Garda, which\r\ndisembogues into that of Mantua, near forty miles in length, highly\r\nspoken of by my Lord Arundel to me, as the most pleasant spot in Italy,\r\nfor which reason I observed it with the more diligence, alighting out of\r\nthe coach, and going up to a grove of cypresses growing about a\r\ngentleman's country-house, from whence indeed it presents a most\r\nsurprising prospect. The hills and gentle risings about it produce\r\noranges, citrons, olives, figs, and other tempting fruits, and the waters\r\nabound in excellent fish, especially trouts. In the middle of this lake\r\nstands Sermonea, on an island; here Captain Wray bought a pretty nag of\r\nthe master of our inn where we dined, for eight pistoles, which his wife,\r\nour hostess, was so unwilling to part with, that she did nothing but kiss\r\nand weep and hang about the horse's neck, till the captain rode away.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BRESCIA]\r\n\r\nWe came this evening to Brescia, which next morning we traversed,\r\naccording to our custom, in search of antiquities and new sights. Here, I\r\npurchased of old Lazarino Cominazzo my fine carbine, which cost me nine\r\npistoles, this city being famous for these firearms, and that workman,\r\nJo. Bap. Franco, the best esteemed. The city consists most in artists,\r\nevery shop abounding in guns, swords, armorers, etc. Most of the workmen\r\ncome out of Germany. It stands in a fertile plain, yet the castle is\r\nbuilt on a hill. The streets abound in fair fountains. The Torre della\r\nPallada is of a noble Tuscan order, and the Senate house is inferior to\r\nfew. The piazza is but indifferent; some of the houses arched as at\r\nPadua. The Cathedral was under repair. We would from hence have visited\r\nParma, Piacenza, Mantua, etc.; but the banditti and other dangerous\r\nparties being abroad, committing many enormities, we were contented with\r\na Pisgah sight of them.\r\n\r\nWe dined next day, at Ursa Vecchia, and, after dinner, passed by an\r\nexceeding strong fort of the Venetians, called Ursa Nova, on their\r\nfrontier. Then by the river Oglio, and so by Sonano, where we enter the\r\nSpanish dominions, and that night arrived at Crema, which belongs to\r\nVenice, and is well defended. The Podesta's Palace is finely built, and\r\nso is the Duomo, or Cathedral, and the tower to it, with an ample piazza.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MILAN]\r\n\r\nEarly next day, after four miles' riding, we entered into the State of\r\nMilan, and passed by Lodi, a great city famous for cheese, little short\r\nof the best Parmeggiano. We dined at Marignano, ten miles before coming\r\nto Milan, where we met half a dozen suspicious cavaliers, who yet did us\r\nno harm. Then, passing as through a continual garden, we went on with\r\nexceeding pleasure; for it is the Paradise of Lombardy, the highways as\r\neven and straight as a line, the fields to a vast extent planted with\r\nfruit about the inclosures, vines to every tree at equal distances, and\r\nwatered with frequent streams. There was likewise much corn, and olives\r\nin abundance. At approach of the city, some of our company, in dread of\r\nthe Inquisition (severer here than in all Spain), thought of throwing\r\naway some Protestant books and papers. We arrived about three in the\r\nafternoon, when the officers searched us thoroughly for prohibited goods;\r\nbut, finding we were only gentlemen travelers, dismissed us for a small\r\nreward, and we went quietly to our inn, the THREE KINGS, where, for that\r\nday, we refreshed ourselves, as we had need. The next morning, we\r\ndelivered our letters of recommendation to the learned and courteous\r\nFerrarius, a Doctor of the Ambrosian College, who conducted us to all the\r\nremarkable places of the town, the first of which was the famous\r\nCathedral. We entered by a portico, so little inferior to that of Rome\r\nthat, when it is finished, it will be hard to say which is the fairest;\r\nthe materials are all of white and black marble, with columns of great\r\nheight, of Egyptian granite. The outside of the church is so full of\r\nsculpture, that you may number 4,000 statues, all of white marble, among\r\nwhich that of St. Bartholomew is esteemed a masterpiece. The church is\r\nvery spacious, almost as long as St. Peter's at Rome, but not so large.\r\nAbout the choir, the sacred Story is finely sculptured, in snow-white\r\nmarble, nor know I where it is exceeded. About the body of the church\r\nare the miracles of St. Charles Borromeo, and in the vault beneath is his\r\nbody before the high altar, grated, and inclosed, in one of the largest\r\ncrystals in Europe. To this also belongs a rich treasure. The cupola is\r\nall of marble within and without, and even covered with great planks of\r\nmarble, in the Gothic design. The windows are most beautifully painted.\r\nHere are two very fair and excellent organs. The fabric is erected in the\r\nmidst of a fair piazza, and in the center of the city.\r\n\r\nHence, we went to the Palace of the Archbishop, which is a quadrangle,\r\nthe architecture of Theobaldi, who designed much for Philip II. in the\r\nEscurial, and has built much in Milan. Hence, into the Governor's Palace,\r\nwho was Constable of Castile. Tempted by the glorious tapestries and\r\npictures, I adventured so far alone, that peeping into a chamber where\r\nthe great man was under the barber's hands, he sent one of his negroes (a\r\nslave) to know what I was. I made the best excuse I could, and that I was\r\nonly admiring the pictures, which he returning and telling his lord, I\r\nheard the Governor reply that I was a spy; on which I retired with all\r\nthe speed I could, passed the guard of Swiss, got into the street, and in\r\na moment to my company, who were gone to the Jesuits' Church, which in\r\ntruth is a noble structure, the front especially, after the modern. After\r\ndinner, we were conducted to St. Celso, a church of rare architecture,\r\nbuilt by Bramante; the carvings of the marble _facciata_ are by Annibal\r\nFontana, whom they esteem at Milan equal to the best of the ancients. In\r\na room joining to the church, is a marble Madonna, like a Colosse, of the\r\nsame sculptor's work, which they will not expose to the air. There are\r\ntwo _sacristias_, in one of which is a fine Virgin, of Leonardo da Vinci;\r\nin the other is one of Raphael d'Urbino, a piece which all the world\r\nadmires. The Sacristan showed us a world of rich plate, jewels, and\r\nembroidered copes, which are kept in presses.\r\n\r\nNext, we went to see the Great Hospital, a quadrangular cloister of a\r\nvast compass, a truly royal fabric, with an annual endowment of 50,000\r\ncrowns of gold. There is in the middle of it a cross building for the\r\nsick, and, just under it, an altar so placed as to be seen in all places\r\nof the Infirmary.\r\n\r\nThere are divers colleges built in this quarter, richly provided for by\r\nthe same Borromeo and his nephew, the last Cardinal Frederico, some not\r\nyet finished, but of excellent design.\r\n\r\nIn St. Eustorgio, they tell us, formerly lay the bodies of the three\r\nMagi, since translated to Cologne in Germany; they, however, preserve the\r\ntomb, which is a square stone, on which is engraven a star, and, under\r\nit, \"_Sepulchrum trium Magorum_.\"\r\n\r\nPassing by St. Laurence, we saw sixteen columns of marble, and the ruins\r\nof a Temple of Hercules, with this inscription yet standing:\r\n\r\n    \"_Imp. Cæsari L. Aurelio Vero Aug. Arminiaco Medio Parthico Maxi\r\n    Tribi Pot. VII. Impi IIII. Cos. III. P. P. Divi Antonini Pij Divi\r\n    Hadriani Nepoti Divi Trajani Parthici Pro-Nepoti Divi Nervæ\r\n    Abnepoti Dec. Dec._\"\r\n\r\nWe concluded this day's wandering at the Monastery of Madonna delle\r\nGrazie, and in the refectory admired that celebrated _Coena Domini_ of\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, which takes up the entire wall at the end, and is the\r\nsame that the great virtuoso, Francis I., of France, was so enamored of,\r\nthat he consulted to remove the whole wall by binding it about with ribs\r\nof iron and timber, to convey it into France. It is indeed one of the\r\nrarest paintings that was ever executed by Leonardo, who was long in the\r\nservice of that Prince, and so dear to him that the King, coming to visit\r\nhim in his old age and sickness, he expired in his arms. But this\r\nincomparable piece is now exceedingly impaired.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning came the learned Dr. Ferrarius to visit us, and took\r\nus in his coach to see the Ambrosian Library, where Cardinal Fred\r\nBorromeo has expended so vast a sum on this building, and in furnishing\r\nwith curiosities, especially paintings and drawings of inestimable value\r\namong painters. It is a school fit to make the ablest artists. There are\r\nmany rare things of Hans Breugel, and among them the Four Elements. In\r\nthis room, stands the glorious [boasting] inscription of Cavaliero\r\nGaleazzo Arconati, valuing his gift to the library of several drawings by\r\nDa Vinci; but these we could not see, the keeper of them being out of\r\ntown, and he always carrying the keys with him; but my Lord Marshal, who\r\nhad seen them, told me all but one book are small that a huge folio\r\ncontained 400 leaves full of scratches of Indians, etc. But whereas the\r\ninscription pretends that our King Charles had offered £1,000 for\r\nthem,--the truth is, and my Lord himself told me, that it was he who\r\ntreated with Galeazzo for himself, in the name and by permission of the\r\nKing, and that the Duke of Feria, who was then Governor, should make the\r\nbargain; but my Lord, having seen them since, did not think them of so\r\nmuch worth.\r\n\r\nIn the great room, where is a goodly library, on the right hand of the\r\ndoor, is a small wainscot closet, furnished with rare manuscripts. Two\r\noriginal letters of the Grand Signor were shown us, sent to two Popes,\r\none of which was (as I remember) to Alexander VI. [Borgia], and the other\r\nmentioning the head of the lance which pierced our Blessed Savior's side,\r\nas a present to the Pope: I would feign have gotten a copy of them, but\r\ncould not; I hear, however, that they are since translated into Italian,\r\nand that therein is a most honorable mention of Christ.\r\n\r\nWe revisited St. Ambrose's church. The high altar is supported by four\r\nporphyry columns, and under it lie the remains of that holy man. Near it\r\nthey showed us a pit, or well (an obscure place it is), where they say\r\nSt. Ambrose baptized St. Augustine, and recited the _Te Deum_; for so\r\nimports the inscription. The place is also famous for some Councils that\r\nhave been held here, and for the coronation of divers Italian Kings and\r\nEmperors, receiving the iron crown from the Archbishop of this see.[37]\r\nThey show the History by Josephus, written on the bark of trees. The high\r\naltar is wonderfully rich.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: Bonaparte afterward took it, and placed it on his own\r\n    head.]\r\n\r\nMilan is one of the most princely cities in Europe: it has no suburbs,\r\nbut is circled with a stately wall for ten miles, in the center of a\r\ncountry that seems to flow with milk and honey. The air is excellent; the\r\nfields fruitful to admiration, the market abounding with all sorts of\r\nprovisions. In the city are near 100 churches, 71 monasteries, and 40,000\r\ninhabitants; it is of a circular figure, fortified with bastions, full of\r\nsumptuous palaces and rare artists, especially for works in crystal,\r\nwhich is here cheap, being found among the Alps. They have curious\r\nstraw-work among the nuns, even to admiration. It has a good river, and a\r\ncitadel at some small distance from the city, commanding it, of great\r\nstrength for its works and munitions of all kinds. It was built by\r\nGaleatius II., and consists of four bastions, and works at the angles and\r\nfronts; the graff is faced with brick to a very great depth; has two\r\nstrong towers as one enters, and within is another fort, and spacious\r\nlodgings for the soldiers, and for exercising them. No accommodation for\r\nstrength is wanting, and all exactly uniform. They have here also all\r\nsorts of work and tradesmen, a great magazine of arms and provisions. The\r\nfosse is of spring water, with a mill for grinding corn, and the ramparts\r\nvaulted underneath. Don Juan Vasques Coronada was now Governor; the\r\ngarrison Spaniards only.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing better worth seeing than the collection of Signor\r\nSeptalla, a canon of St. Ambrose, famous over Christendom for his\r\nlearning and virtues. Among other things, he showed us an Indian wood,\r\nthat has the perfect scent of civet; a flint, or pebble, that has a\r\nquantity of water in it, which is plainly to be seen, it being clear as\r\nagate; divers crystals that have water moving in them, some of them\r\nhaving plants, leaves, and hog's bristles in them; much amber full of\r\ninsects, and divers things of woven amianthus.\r\n\r\nMilan is a sweet place, and though the streets are narrow, they abound in\r\nrich coaches, and are full of noblesse, who frequent the course every\r\nnight. Walking a turn in the portico before the dome, a cavaliero who\r\npassed by, hearing some of us speaking English, looked a good while\r\nearnestly on us, and by and by sending his servant, desiring we would\r\nhonor him the next day at dinner. We looked on this as an odd invitation,\r\nhe not speaking to us himself, but we returned his civility with thanks,\r\nthough not fully resolved what to do, or indeed what might be the meaning\r\nof it in this jealous place; but on inquiry, it was told us he was a\r\nScots Colonel, who had an honorable command in the city, so that we\r\nagreed to go. This afternoon, we were wholly taken up in seeing an opera\r\nrepresented by some Neapolitans, performed all in excellent music with\r\nrare scenes, in which there acted a celebrated beauty.\r\n\r\nNext morning, we went to the Colonel's, who had sent his servant again to\r\nconduct us to his house, which we found to be a noble palace, richly\r\nfurnished. There were other guests, all soldiers, one of them a\r\nScotchman, but we could not learn one of their names. At dinner, he\r\nexcused his rudeness that he had not himself spoken to us; telling us it\r\nwas his custom, when he heard of any English travelers (who but rarely\r\nwould be known to pass through that city for fear of the Inquisition), to\r\ninvite them to his house, where they might be free. We had a sumptuous\r\ndinner; and the wine was so tempting, that after some healths had gone\r\nabout, and we had risen from the table, the Colonel led us into his hall,\r\nwhere there hung up divers colors, saddles, bridles, pistols, and other\r\narms, being trophies which he had taken with his own hands from the\r\nenemy; among them, he would needs bestow a pair of pistols on Captain\r\nWray, one of our fellow-travelers, and a good drinking gentleman, and on\r\nme a Turkish bridle woven with silk and very curiously embossed, with\r\nother silk trappings, to which hung a half moon finely wrought, which he\r\nhad taken from a bashaw whom he had slain. With this glorious spoil, I\r\nrode the rest of my journey as far as Paris, and brought it afterward\r\ninto England. He then showed us a stable of brave horses, with his menage\r\nand cavalerizzo. Some of the horses he caused to be brought out, which he\r\nmounted, and performed all the motions of an excellent horseman. When\r\nthis was done, and he had alighted,--contrary to the advice of his groom\r\nand page, who knew the nature of the beast, and that their master was a\r\nlittle spirited with wine, he would have a fiery horse that had not yet\r\nbeen managed and was very ungovernable, but was otherwise a very\r\nbeautiful creature; this he mounting, the horse, getting the reins in a\r\nfull _carriere_, rose so desperately that he fell quite back, crushing\r\nthe Colonel so forcibly against the wall of the menage, that though he\r\nsat on him like a Centaur, yet recovering the jade on all fours again, he\r\ndesired to be taken down and so led in, where he cast himself on a\r\npallet; and, with infinite lamentations, after some time we took leave of\r\nhim, being now speechless. The next morning, going to visit him, we found\r\nbefore the door the canopy which they usually carry over the host, and\r\nsome with lighted tapers; which made us suspect he was in a very sad\r\ncondition, and so indeed we found him, an Irish Friar standing by his\r\nbedside as confessing him, or at least disguising a confession, and\r\nother ceremonies used _in extremis_; for we afterward learned that the\r\ngentleman was a Protestant, and had this Friar, his confidant; which was\r\na dangerous thing at Milan, had it been but suspected. At our entrance,\r\nhe sighed grievously, and held up his hands, but was not able to speak.\r\nAfter vomiting some blood, he kindly took us all by the hand, and made\r\nsigns that he should see us no more, which made us take our leave of him\r\nwith extreme reluctancy and affliction for the accident. This sad\r\ndisaster made us consult about our departure as soon as we could, not\r\nknowing how we might be inquired after, or engaged, the Inquisition being\r\nso cruelly formidable and inevitable, on the least suspicion. The next\r\nmorning, therefore, discharging our lodgings, we agreed for a coach to\r\ncarry us to the foot of the Alps, not a little concerned for the death of\r\nthe Colonel, which we now heard of, and who had so courteously\r\nentertained us.\r\n\r\nThe first day we got as far as Castellanza, by which runs a considerable\r\nriver into Lago Maggiore; here, at dinner, were two or three Jesuits, who\r\nwere very pragmatical and inquisitive, whom we declined conversation with\r\nas decently as we could; so we pursued our journey through a most\r\nfruitful plain, but the weather was wet and uncomfortable. At night, we\r\nlay at Sesto.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, leaving our coach, we embarked in a boat to carry us\r\nover the lake (being one of the largest in Europe), and whence we could\r\nsee the towering Alps, and among them the great San Bernardo, esteemed\r\nthe highest mountain in Europe, appearing to be some miles above the\r\nclouds. Through this vast water, passes the river Ticinus, which\r\ndischarges itself into the Po, by which means Helvetia transports her\r\nmerchandizes into Italy, which we now begin to leave behind us.\r\n\r\nHaving now sailed about two leagues, we were hauled ashore at Arona, a\r\nstrong town belonging to the Duchy of Milan, where, being examined by the\r\nGovernor, and paying a small duty, we were dismissed. Opposite to this\r\nfort, is Angiera, another small town, the passage very pleasant with the\r\nprospect of the Alps covered with pine and fir trees, and above them\r\nsnow. We passed the pretty island Isabella, about the middle of the\r\nlake, on which is a fair house built on a mount; indeed, the whole island\r\nis a mount ascended by several terraces and walks all set above with\r\norange and citron trees.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ISOLA]\r\n\r\nThe next we saw was Isola, and we left on our right hand the Isle of St.\r\nJovanni; and so sailing by another small town built also on an island, we\r\narrived at night at Margazzo, an obscure village at the end of the lake,\r\nand at the very foot of the Alps, which now rise as it were suddenly\r\nafter some hundreds of miles of the most even country in the world, and\r\nwhere there is hardly a stone to be found, as if Nature had here swept up\r\nthe rubbish of the earth in the Alps, to form and clear the plains of\r\nLombardy, which we had hitherto passed since our coming from Venice. In\r\nthis wretched place, I lay on a bed stuffed with leaves, which made such\r\na crackling and did so prick my skin through the tick, that I could not\r\nsleep. The next morning, I was furnished with an ass, for we could not\r\nget horses; instead of stirrups, we had ropes tied with a loop to put our\r\nfeet in, which supplied the place of other trappings. Thus, with my\r\ngallant steed, bridled with my Turkish present, we passed through a\r\nreasonably pleasant but very narrow valley, till we came to Duomo, where\r\nwe rested, and, having showed the Spanish pass, the Governor would press\r\nanother on us, that his secretary might get a crown. Here we exchanged\r\nour asses for mules, sure-footed on the hills and precipices, being\r\naccustomed to pass them. Hiring a guide, we were brought that night\r\nthrough very steep, craggy, and dangerous passages to a village called\r\nVedra, being the last of the King of Spain's dominions in the Duchy of\r\nMilan. We had a very infamous wretched lodging.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we mounted again through strange, horrid, and fearful\r\ncrags and tracts, abounding in pine trees, and only inhabited by bears,\r\nwolves, and wild goats; nor could we anywhere see above a pistol shot\r\nbefore us, the horizon being terminated with rocks and mountains, whose\r\ntops, covered with snow, seemed to touch the skies, and in many places\r\npierced the clouds. Some of these vast mountains were but one entire\r\nstone, between whose clefts now and then precipitated great cataracts of\r\nmelted snow, and other waters, which made a terrible roaring, echoing\r\nfrom the rocks and cavities; and these waters in some places breaking in\r\nthe fall, wet us as if we had passed through a mist, so as we could\r\nneither see nor hear one another, but, trusting to our honest mules, we\r\njogged on our way. The narrow bridges, in some places made only by\r\nfelling huge fir trees, and laying them athwart from mountain to\r\nmountain, over cataracts of stupendous depth, are very dangerous, and so\r\nare the passages and edges made by cutting away the main rock; others in\r\nsteps; and in some places we pass between mountains that have been broken\r\nand fallen on one another; which is very terrible, and one had need of a\r\nsure foot and steady head to climb some of these precipices, besides that\r\nthey are harbors for bears and wolves, who have sometimes assaulted\r\ntravelers. In these straits, we frequently alighted, now freezing in the\r\nsnow, and anon frying by the reverberation of the sun against the cliffs\r\nas we descend lower, when we meet now and then a few miserable cottages\r\nso built upon the declining of the rocks, as one would expect their\r\nsliding down. Among these, inhabit a goodly sort of people, having\r\nmonstrous gullets, or wens of flesh, growing to their throats, some of\r\nwhich I have seen as big as an hundred pound bag of silver hanging under\r\ntheir chins; among the women especially, and that so ponderous, as that\r\nto ease them, many wear linen cloth bound about their head, and coming\r\nunder the chin to support it; but _quis tumidum guttur miratur in\r\nAlpibus?_ Their drinking so much snow water is thought to be the cause of\r\nit; the men using more wine, are not so strumous as the women. The truth\r\nis, they are a peculiar race of people, and many great water drinkers\r\nhere have not these prodigious tumors; it runs, as we say, in the blood,\r\nand is a vice in the race, and renders them so ugly, shriveled and\r\ndeformed, by its drawing the skin of the face down, that nothing can be\r\nmore frightful; to this add a strange puffing dress, furs, and that\r\nbarbarous language, being a mixture of corrupt High German, French, and\r\nItalian. The people are of great stature, extremely fierce and rude, yet\r\nvery honest and trusty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MOUNT SAMPION]\r\n\r\nThis night, through almost inaccessible heights, we came in prospect of\r\nMons Sempronius, now Mount Sampion, which has on its summit a few huts\r\nand a chapel. Approaching this, Captain Wray's water spaniel (a huge\r\nfilthy cur that had followed him out of England) hunted a herd of goats\r\ndown the rocks into a river made by the melting of the snow. Arrived at\r\nour cold harbor (though the house had a stove in every room) and supping\r\non cheese and milk with wretched wine, we went to bed in cupboards so\r\nhigh from the floor, that we climbed them by a ladder; we were covered\r\nwith feathers, that is, we lay between two ticks stuffed with them, and\r\nall little enough to keep one warm. The ceilings of the rooms are\r\nstrangely low for those tall people. The house was now (in September)\r\nhalf covered with snow, nor is there a tree, or a bush, growing within\r\nmany miles.\r\n\r\nFrom this uncomfortable place, we prepared to hasten away the next\r\nmorning; but, as we were getting on our mules, comes a huge young fellow\r\ndemanding money for a goat which he affirmed that Captain Wray's dog had\r\nkilled; expostulating the matter, and impatient of staying in the cold,\r\nwe set spurs and endeavored to ride away, when a multitude of people\r\nbeing by this time gotten together about us (for it being Sunday morning\r\nand attending for the priest to say mass), they stopped our mules, beat\r\nus off our saddles, and, disarming us of our carbines, drew us into one\r\nof the rooms of our lodging, and set a guard upon us. Thus we continued\r\nprisoners till mass was ended, and then came half a score grim Swiss,\r\nwho, taking on them to be magistrates, sat down on the table, and\r\ncondemned us to pay a pistole for the goat, and ten more for attempting\r\nto ride away, threatening that if we did not pay it speedily, they would\r\nsend us to prison, and keep us to a day of public justice, where, as they\r\nperhaps would have exaggerated the crime, for they pretended we had\r\nprimed our carbines and would have shot some of them (as indeed the\r\nCaptain was about to do), we might have had our heads cut off, as we were\r\ntold afterward, for that among these rude people a very small misdemeanor\r\ndoes often meet that sentence. Though the proceedings appeared highly\r\nunjust, on consultation among ourselves we thought it safer to rid\r\nourselves out of their hands, and the trouble we were brought into; and\r\ntherefore we patiently laid down the money, and with fierce countenances\r\nhad our mules and arms delivered to us, and glad we were to escape as we\r\ndid. This was cold entertainment, but our journey after was colder, the\r\nrest of the way having been (as they told us) covered with snow since the\r\nCreation; no man remembered it to be without; and because, by the\r\nfrequent snowing, the tracks are continually filled up, we passed by\r\nseveral tall masts set up to guide travelers, so as for many miles they\r\nstand in ken of one another, like to our beacons. In some places, where\r\nthere is a cleft between two mountains, the snow fills it up, while the\r\nbottom, being thawed, leaves as it were a frozen arch of snow, and that\r\nso hard as to bear the greatest weight; for as it snows often, so it\r\nperpetually freezes, of which I was so sensible that it flawed the very\r\nskin of my face.\r\n\r\nBeginning now to descend a little, Captain Wray's horse (that was our\r\nsumpter and carried all our baggage) plunging through a bank of loose\r\nsnow, slid down a frightful precipice, which so incensed the choleric\r\ncavalier, his master, that he was sending a brace of bullets into the\r\npoor beast, lest our guide should recover him, and run away with his\r\nburden; but, just as he was lifting up his carbine, we gave such a shout,\r\nand so pelted the horse with snow-balls, as with all his might plunging\r\nthrough the snow, he fell from another steep place into another bottom,\r\nnear a path we were to pass. It was yet a good while ere we got to him,\r\nbut at last we recovered the place, and, easing him of his charge, hauled\r\nhim out of the snow, where he had been certainly frozen in, if we had not\r\nprevented it, before night. It was as we judged almost two miles that he\r\nhad slid and fallen, yet without any other harm than the benumbing of his\r\nlimbs for the present, but, with lusty rubbing and chafing he began to\r\nmove, and, after a little walking, performed his journey well enough. All\r\nthis way, affrighted with the disaster of this horse, we trudged on foot,\r\ndriving our mules before us; sometimes we fell, sometimes we slid,\r\nthrough this ocean of snow, which after October is impassible. Toward\r\nnight, we came into a larger way, through vast woods of pines, which\r\nclothe the middle parts of these rocks. Here, they were burning some to\r\nmake pitch and rosin, peeling the knotty branches, as we do to make\r\ncharcoal, reserving what melts from them, which hardens into pitch. We\r\npassed several cascades of dissolved snow, that had made channels of\r\nformidable depth in the crevices of the mountains, and with such a\r\nfearful roaring as we could hear it for seven long miles. It is from\r\nthese sources that the Rhone and the Rhine, which pass through all France\r\nand Germany, derive their originals. Late at night, we got to a town\r\ncalled Briga, at the foot of the Alps, in the Valteline. Almost every\r\ndoor had nailed on the outside and next the street a bear's, wolf's, or\r\nfox's head, and divers of them, all three; a savage kind of sight, but,\r\nas the Alps are full of the beasts, the people often kill them. The next\r\nmorning, we returned to our guide, and took fresh mules, and another to\r\nconduct us to the Lake of Geneva, passing through as pleasant a country\r\nas that we had just traveled was melancholy and troublesome. A strange\r\nand sudden change it seemed; for the reverberation of the sunbeams from\r\nthe mountains and rocks that like walls range it on both sides, not above\r\ntwo flight-shots in breadth, for a very great number of miles, renders\r\nthe passage excessively hot. Through such extremes we continued our\r\njourney, that goodly river, the Rhone, gliding by us in a narrow and\r\nquiet channel almost in the middle of this Canton, fertilizing the\r\ncountry for grass and corn, which grow here in abundance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SION]\r\n\r\nWe arrived this night at Sion, a pretty town and city, a bishop's seat,\r\nand the head of Valesia. There is a castle, and the bishop who resides in\r\nit, has both civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Our host, as the\r\ncustom of these Cantons is, was one of the chiefest of the town, and had\r\nbeen a Colonel in France: he treated us with extreme civility, and was so\r\ndispleased at the usage we received at Mount Sampion, that he would needs\r\ngive us a letter to the Governor of the country, who resided at St.\r\nMaurice, which was in our way to Geneva, to revenge the affront. This was\r\na true old blade, and had been a very curious virtuoso, as we found by a\r\nhandsome collection of books, medals, pictures, shells, and other\r\nantiquities. He showed two heads and horns of the true capricorn, which\r\nanimal he told us was frequently killed among the mountains; one branch\r\nof them was as much as I could well lift, and near as high as my head,\r\nnot much unlike the greater sort of goat's, save that they bent forward,\r\nby help whereof they climb up and hang on inaccessible rocks, from whence\r\nthe inhabitants now and then shoot them. They speak prodigious things of\r\ntheir leaping from crag to crag, and of their sure footing,\r\nnotwithstanding their being cloven-footed, unapt (one would think) to\r\ntake hold and walk so steadily on those horrible ridges as they do. The\r\nColonel would have given me one of these beams, but the want of a\r\nconvenience to carry it along with me, caused me to refuse his courtesy.\r\nHe told me that in the castle there were some Roman and Christian\r\nantiquities, and he had some inscriptions in his own garden. He invited\r\nus to his country-house, where he said he had better pictures, and other\r\nrarities; but, our time being short, I could not persuade my companions\r\nto stay and visit the places he would have had us see, nor the offer he\r\nmade to show us the hunting of the bear, wolf, and other wild beasts. The\r\nnext morning, having presented his daughter, a pretty well-fashioned\r\nyoung woman, with a small ruby ring, we parted somewhat late from our\r\ngenerous host.\r\n\r\nPassing through the same pleasant valley between the horrid mountains on\r\neither hand, like a gallery many miles in length, we got to Martigni,\r\nwhere also we were well entertained. The houses in this country are all\r\nbuilt of fir boards, planed within, low, and seldom above one story. The\r\npeople very clownish and rusticly clad, after a very odd fashion, for the\r\nmost part in blue cloth, very whole and warm, with little variety of\r\ndistinction between the gentleman and common sort, by a law of their\r\ncountry being exceedingly frugal. Add to this their great honesty and\r\nfidelity, though exacting enough for what they part with: I saw not one\r\nbeggar. We paid the value of twenty shillings English, for a day's hire\r\nof one horse. Every man goes with a sword by his side, the whole country\r\nwell disciplined, and indeed impregnable, which made the Romans have such\r\nill success against them; one lusty Swiss at their narrow passages is\r\nsufficient to repel a legion. It is a frequent thing here for a young\r\ntradesman, or farmer, to leave his wife and children for twelve or\r\nfifteen years, and seek his fortune in the wars in Spain, France, Italy,\r\nor Germany, and then return again to work. I look upon this country to be\r\nthe safest spot of all Europe, neither envied nor envying; nor are any of\r\nthem rich, nor poor; they live in great simplicity and tranquillity;\r\nand, though of the fourteen Cantons half be Roman Catholics, the rest\r\nreformed, yet they mutually agree, and are confederate with Geneva, and\r\nare its only security against its potent neighbors, as they themselves\r\nare from being attacked by the greater potentates, by the mutual jealousy\r\nof their neighbors, as either of them would be overbalanced, should the\r\nSwiss, who are wholly mercenary and auxiliaries, be subjected to France\r\nor Spain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEVERETTA]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GENEVA]\r\n\r\nWe were now arrived at St. Maurice, a large handsome town and residence\r\nof the President, where justice is done. To him we presented our letter\r\nfrom Sion, and made known the ill usage we had received for killing a\r\nwretched goat, which so incensed him, that he swore if we would stay he\r\nwould not only help us to recover our money again, but most severely\r\npunish the whole rabble; but our desire of revenge had by this time\r\nsubsided, and glad we were to be gotten so near France, which we reckoned\r\nas good as home. He courteously invited us to dine with him; but we\r\nexcused ourselves, and, returning to our inn, while we were eating\r\nsomething before we took horse, the Governor had caused two pages to\r\nbring us a present of two great vessels of covered plate full of\r\nexcellent wine, in which we drank his health, and rewarded the youths;\r\nthey were two vast bowls supported by two Swiss, handsomely wrought after\r\nthe German manner. This civility and that of our host at Sion, perfectly\r\nreconciled us to the highlanders; and so, proceeding on our journey we\r\npassed this afternoon through the gate which divides the Valais from the\r\nDuchy of Savoy, into which we were now entering, and so, through Montei,\r\nwe arrived that evening at Beveretta. Being extremely weary and\r\ncomplaining of my head, and finding little accommodation in the house, I\r\ncaused one of our hostess's daughters to be removed out of her bed and\r\nwent immediately into it while it was yet warm, being so heavy with pain\r\nand drowsiness that I would not stay to have the sheets changed; but I\r\nshortly after paid dearly for my impatience, falling sick of the smallpox\r\nas soon as I came to Geneva, for by the smell of frankincense and the\r\ntale the good woman told me of her daughter having had an ague, I\r\nafterward concluded she had been newly recovered of the smallpox.\r\nNotwithstanding this, I went with my company, the next day, hiring a bark\r\nto carry us over the lake; and indeed, sick as I was, the weather was so\r\nserene and bright, the water so calm, and air so temperate, that never\r\nhad travelers a sweeter passage. Thus, we sailed the whole length of the\r\nlake, about thirty miles, the countries bordering on it (Savoy and Berne)\r\naffording one of the most delightful prospects in the world, the Alps\r\ncovered with snow, though at a great distance, yet showing their aspiring\r\ntops. Through this lake, the river Rhodanus passes with that velocity as\r\nnot to mingle with its exceeding deep waters, which are very clear, and\r\nbreed the most celebrated trout for largeness and goodness of any in\r\nEurope. I have ordinarily seen one of three feet in length sold in the\r\nmarket for a small price, and such we had in the lodging where we abode,\r\nwhich was at the White Cross. All this while, I held up tolerably; and\r\nthe next morning having a letter for Signor John Diodati, the famous\r\nItalian minister and translator of the Holy Bible into that language, I\r\nwent to his house, and had a great deal of discourse with that learned\r\nperson. He told me he had been in England, driven by tempest into Deal,\r\nwhile sailing for Holland, that he had seen London, and was exceedingly\r\ntaken with the civilities he received. He so much approved of our\r\nChurch-government by Bishops, that he told me the French Protestants\r\nwould make no scruple to submit to it and all its pomp, had they a king\r\nof the Reformed religion as we had. He exceedingly deplored the\r\ndifference now between his Majesty and the Parliament. After dinner, came\r\none Monsieur Saladine, with his little pupil, the Earl of Caernarvon, to\r\nvisit us, offering to carry us to the principal places of the town; but,\r\nbeing now no more able to hold up my head, I was constrained to keep my\r\nchamber, imagining that my very eyes would have dropped out; and this\r\nnight I felt such a stinging about me, that I could not sleep. In the\r\nmorning, I was very ill, but sending for a doctor, he persuaded me to be\r\nbled. He was a very learned old man, and, as he said, he had been\r\nphysician to Gustavus the Great, King of Sweden, when he passed this way\r\ninto Italy, under the name of Monsieur Gars, the initial letters of\r\nGustavus Adolphus Rex Sueciæ, and of our famous Duke of Buckingham, on\r\nhis returning out of Italy. He afterward acknowledged that he should not\r\nhave bled me, had he suspected the smallpox, which broke out a day after.\r\nHe afterward purged me, and applied leeches, and God knows what this\r\nwould have produced, if the spots had not appeared, for he was thinking\r\nof bleeding me again. They now kept me warm in bed for sixteen days,\r\ntended by a vigilant Swiss matron, whose monstrous throat, when I\r\nsometimes awakened out of unquiet slumbers, would affright me. After the\r\npimples were come forth, which were not many, I had much ease as to pain,\r\nbut infinitely afflicted with heat and noisomeness. By God's mercy, after\r\nfive weeks' keeping my chamber, I went abroad. Monsieur Saladine and his\r\nlady sent me many refreshments. Monsieur Le Chat, my physician, to excuse\r\nhis letting me bleed, told me it was so burnt and vicious as it would\r\nhave proved the plague, or spotted fever, had he proceeded by any other\r\nmethod. On my recovering sufficiently to go abroad, I dined at Monsieur\r\nSaladine's, and in the afternoon went across the water on the side of the\r\nlake, and took a lodging that stood exceedingly pleasant, about half a\r\nmile from the city for the better airing; but I stayed only one night,\r\nhaving no company there, save my pipe; so, the next day, I caused them to\r\nrow me about the lake as far as the great stone, which they call\r\nNEPTUNE'S ROCK, on which they say sacrifice was anciently offered to him.\r\nThence, I landed at certain cherry gardens and pretty villas by the side\r\nof the lake, and exceedingly pleasant. Returning, I visited their\r\nconservatories of fish; in which were trouts of six and seven feet long,\r\nAS THEY AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nThe Rhone, which parts the city in the midst dips into a cavern\r\nunderground, about six miles from it, and afterward rises again, and runs\r\nits open course, like our Mole, or Swallow, by Dorking, in Surrey. The\r\nnext morning (being Thursday) I heard Dr. Diodati preach in Italian, many\r\nof that country, especially of Lucca, his native place, being inhabitants\r\nof Geneva, and of the Reformed religion.\r\n\r\nThe town lying between Germany, France, and Italy, those three tongues\r\nare familiarly spoken by the inhabitants. It is a strong, well-fortified\r\ncity, part of it built on a rising ground. The houses are not despicable,\r\nbut the high pent-houses (for I can hardly call them cloisters, being\r\nall of wood), through which the people pass dry and in the shade, winter\r\nand summer, exceedingly deform the fronts of the buildings. Here are\r\nabundance of booksellers; but their books are of ill impressions; these,\r\nwith watches (of which store are made here), crystal, and excellent\r\nscrewed guns, are the staple commodities. All provisions are good and\r\ncheap.\r\n\r\nThe town-house is fairly built of stone; the portico has four black\r\nmarble columns; and, on a table of the same, under the city arms, a\r\ndemi-eagle and cross, between cross-keys, is a motto, \"POST TENEBRAS\r\nLUX,\" and this inscription:\r\n\r\n    _Quum anno 1535 profligatâ Romanâ Anti-Christi Tyrannide,\r\n    abrogatisq; ejus superstitionibus, sacro-sancta Christi Religio hìc\r\n    in suam puritatem, Ecclesiâ in meliorem ordinem singulari Dei\r\n    beneficio repositâ, et simul pulsis fugatisq; hostibus, urbs ipsa\r\n    in suam libertatem, non sine insigni miraculo, restituta fuerit;\r\n    Senatus Populusq; Genevensis Monumentum hoc perpetuæ memoriæ causâ\r\n    fieri atque hoc loco erigi curavit, quod suam erga Deum\r\n    gratitudinem ad posteros testatum fuerit._\r\n\r\nThe territories about the town are not so large as many ordinary\r\ngentlemen have about their country farms, for which cause they are in\r\ncontinual watch, especially on the Savoy side; but, in case of any siege\r\nthe Swiss are at hand, as this inscription in the same place shows,\r\ntoward the street:\r\n\r\n                              D.O.M.S.\r\n\r\n    _Anno a verâ Religione divinitûs cum veteri Libertate Genevæ\r\n    restitutâ, et quasi novo Jubilæo ineunte, plurimis vitatis domi et\r\n    forsi insidiis et superatis tempestatibus, et cum Helvetiorum\r\n    Primari Tigurini æquo jure in societatem perpetuam nobiscum\r\n    venerint, et veteres fidissimi socii Bernenses prius vinculum novo\r\n    adstrinxerint, S.P.Q.G. quod felix esse velit D.O.M. tanti,\r\n    beneficii monumentum consecrârunt, anno temporis ultimi_\r\n    CC[~C~].I[~C~].XXXIV.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate-house, were fourteen ancient urns, dug up as they were\r\nremoving earth in the fortifications.\r\n\r\nA little out of the town is a spacious field, which they call Campus\r\nMartius; and well it may be so termed, with better reason, than that at\r\nRome at present (which is no more a field, but all built into streets),\r\nfor here on every Sunday, after the evening devotions, this precise\r\npeople permit their youth to exercise arms, and shoot in guns, and in the\r\nlong and cross bows, in which they are exceedingly expert, reputed to be\r\nas dexterous as any people in the world. To encourage this, they yearly\r\nelect him who has won most prizes at the mark, to be their king, as the\r\nking of the long-bow, gun, or cross-bow. He then wears that weapon in his\r\nhat in gold, with a crown over it made fast to the hat like a brooch. In\r\nthis field, is a long house wherein their arms and furniture are kept in\r\nseveral places very neatly. To this joins a hall, where, at certain\r\ntimes, they meet and feast; in the glass windows are the arms and names\r\nof their kings [of arms]. At the side of the field, is a very noble\r\nPall-Mall, but it turns with an elbow. There is also a bowling-place, a\r\ntavern, and a trey-table, and here they ride their menaged horses. It is\r\nalso the usual place of public execution of those who suffer for any\r\ncapital crime, though committed in another country, by which law divers\r\nfugitives have been put to death, who have fled hither to escape\r\npunishment in their own country. Among other severe punishments here,\r\nadultery is death. Having seen this field, and played a game at mall, I\r\nsupped with Mr. Saladine.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, I heard Dr. Diodati preach in French, and after the French\r\nmode, in a gown with a cape, and his hat on. The Church Government is\r\nseverely Presbyterian, after the discipline of Calvin and Beza, who set\r\nit up, but nothing so rigid as either our Scots or English sectaries of\r\nthat denomination. In the afternoon, Monsieur Morice, a most learned\r\nyoung person and excellent poet, chief Professor of the University,\r\npreached at St. Peter's, a spacious Gothic fabric. This was heretofore a\r\ncathedral and a reverend pile. It has four turrets, on one of which\r\nstands a continual sentinel; in another cannons are mounted. The church\r\nis very decent within; nor have they at all defaced the painted windows,\r\nwhich are full of pictures of saints; nor the stalls, which are all\r\ncarved with the history of our Blessed Savior.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, I went to see the young townsmen exercise in Mars'\r\nField, where the prizes were pewter-plates and dishes; 'tis said that\r\nsome have gained competent estates by what they have thus won. Here I\r\nfirst saw huge ballistæ, or cross-bows, shot in, being such as they\r\nformerly used in wars, before great guns were known; they were placed in\r\nframes, and had great screws to bend them, doing execution at an\r\nincredible distance. They were most accurate at the long-bow and musket,\r\nrarely missing the smallest mark. I was as busy with the carbine I\r\nbrought from Brescia as any of them. After every shot, I found them go\r\ninto a long house, and cleanse their guns, before they charged again.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, I was invited to a little garden without the works, where were\r\nmany rare tulips, anemones, and other choice flowers. The Rhone, running\r\nathwart the town out of the Lake, makes half the city a suburb, which, in\r\nimitation of Paris, they call St. Germain's Fauxbourg, and it has a\r\nchurch of the same name. On two wooden bridges that cross the river are\r\nseveral water-mills, and shops of trades, especially smiths and cutlers;\r\nbetween the bridges is an island, in the midst of which is a very ancient\r\ntower, said to have been built by Julius Cæsar. At the end of the other\r\nbridge is the mint, and a fair sun-dial.\r\n\r\nPassing again by the town-house, I saw a large crocodile hanging in\r\nchains; and against the wall of one of the chambers, seven judges were\r\npainted without hands, except one in the middle, who has but one hand; I\r\nknow not the story. The Arsenal is at the end of this building, well\r\nfurnished and kept.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Mr. Morice led us to the college, a fair structure; in the\r\nlower part are the schools, which consist of nine classes; and a hall\r\nabove, where the students assemble; also a good library. They showed us a\r\nvery ancient Bible, of about 300 years old, in the vulgar French, and a\r\nMS. in the old Monkish character: here have the Professors their\r\nlodgings. I also went to the Hospital, which is very commodious; but the\r\nBishop's Palace is now a prison.\r\n\r\nThis town is not much celebrated for beautiful women, for, even at this\r\ndistance from the Alps, the gentlewomen have somewhat full throats; but\r\nour Captain Wray (afterward Sir William, eldest son of that Sir\r\nChristopher, who had both been in arms against his Majesty for the\r\nParliament) fell so mightily in love with one of Monsieur Saladine's\r\ndaughters that, with much persuasion, he could not be prevailed on to\r\nthink on his journey into France, the season now coming on extremely hot.\r\n\r\nMy sickness and abode here cost me forty-five pistoles of gold to my\r\nhost, and five to my honest doctor, who for six weeks' attendance and the\r\napothecary thought it so generous a reward that, at my taking leave, he\r\npresented me with his advice for the regimen of my health, written with\r\nhis own hand in Latin. This regimen I much observed, and I bless God\r\npassed the journey without inconvenience from sickness, but it was an\r\nextraordinarily hot unpleasant season and journey, by reason of the\r\ncraggy ways.\r\n\r\n5th July, 1646. We took, or rather purchased, a boat, for it could not be\r\nbrought back against the stream of the Rhone. We were two days going to\r\nLyons, passing many admirable prospects of rocks and cliffs, and near the\r\ntown down a very steep declivity of water for a full mile. From Lyons, we\r\nproceeded the next morning, taking horse to Roanne, and lay that night at\r\nFeurs. At Roanne we indulged ourselves with the best that all France\r\naffords, for here the provisions are choice and plentiful, so as the\r\nsupper we had might have satisfied a prince. We lay in damask beds, and\r\nwere treated like emperors. The town is one of the neatest built in all\r\nFrance, on the brink of the Loire; and here we agreed with an old fisher\r\nto row us as far as Orleans. The first night we came as far as Nevers,\r\nearly enough to see the town, the Cathedral (St. Cyre), the Jesuits'\r\nCollege, and the Castle, a palace of the Duke's, with the bridge to it\r\nnobly built.\r\n\r\nThe next day we passed by La Charité, a pretty town, somewhat distant\r\nfrom the river. Here I lost my faithful spaniel Piccioli, who had\r\nfollowed me from Rome. It seems he had been taken up by some of the\r\nGovernor's pages, or footmen, without recovery; which was a great\r\ndispleasure to me, because the cur had many useful qualities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ORLEANS]\r\n\r\nThe next day we arrived at Orleans, taking our turns to row, of which I\r\nreckon my share came to little less than twenty leagues. Sometimes, we\r\nfooted it through pleasant fields and meadows; sometimes, we shot at\r\nfowls, and other birds; nothing came amiss: sometimes, we played at\r\ncards, while others sung, or were composing verses; for we had the great\r\npoet, Mr. Waller, in our company, and some other ingenious persons.\r\n\r\nAt Orleans we abode but one day; the next, leaving our mad Captain behind\r\nus, I arrived at Paris, rejoiced that, after so many disasters and\r\naccidents in a tedious peregrination, I was gotten so near home, and\r\nhere I resolved to rest myself before I went further.\r\n\r\nIt was now October, and the only time that in my whole life that I spent\r\nmost idly, tempted from my more profitable recesses; but I soon recovered\r\nmy better resolutions and fell to my study, learning the High Dutch and\r\nSpanish tongues, and now and then refreshing my dancing, and such\r\nexercises as I had long omitted, and which are not in much reputation\r\namong the sober Italians.\r\n\r\n28th January, 1647. I changed my lodging in the Place de Monsieur de\r\nMetz, near the Abbey of St. Germains; and thence, on the 12th of\r\nFebruary, to another in Rue Columbier, where I had a very fair apartment,\r\nwhich cost me four pistoles per month. The 18th, I frequented a course of\r\nChemistry, the famous Monsieur Le Febure operating upon most of the\r\nnobler processes. March 3d, Monsieur Mercure began to teach me on the\r\nlute, though to small perfection.\r\n\r\nIn May, I fell sick, and had very weak eyes; for which I was four times\r\nlet bleed.\r\n\r\n22d May, 1647. My valet (Herbert) robbed me of clothes and plate, to the\r\nvalue of three score pounds; but, through the diligence of Sir Richard\r\nBrowne, his Majesty's Resident at the Court of France, and with whose\r\nlady and family I had contracted a great friendship (and particularly set\r\nmy affections on a daughter), I recovered most of them, obtaining of the\r\nJudge, with no small difficulty, that the process against the thief\r\nshould not concern his life, being his first offense.\r\n\r\n10th June, 1647. We concluded about my marriage, in order to which I went\r\nto St. Germains, where his Majesty, then Prince of Wales, had his court,\r\nto desire of Dr. Earle, then one of his chaplains (since Dean of\r\nWestminster, Clerk of the Closet, and Bishop of Salisbury), that he would\r\naccompany me to Paris, which he did; and, on Thursday, 27th of June,\r\n1647, he married us in Sir Richard Browne's chapel, between the hours of\r\neleven and twelve, some few select friends being present. And this being\r\nCorpus Christi feast, was solemnly observed in this country; the streets\r\nwere sumptuously hung with tapestry, and strewed with flowers.\r\n\r\n10th September, 1647. Being called into England, to settle my affairs\r\nafter an absence of four years, I took leave of the Prince and Queen,\r\nleaving my wife, yet very young, under the care of an excellent lady and\r\nprudent mother.\r\n\r\n4th October, 1647. I sealed and declared my will, and that morning went\r\nfrom Paris, taking my journey through Rouen, Dieppe, Ville-dieu, and St.\r\nVallerie, where I stayed one day with Mr. Waller, with whom I had some\r\naffairs, and for which cause I took this circle to Calais, where I\r\narrived on the 11th, and that night embarking in a packet boat, was by\r\none o'clock got safe to Dover; for which I heartily put up my thanks to\r\nGod who had conducted me safe to my own country, and been merciful to me\r\nthrough so many aberrations. Hence, taking post, I arrived at London the\r\nnext day at evening, being the 2d of October, new style.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WOTTON]\r\n\r\n5th October, 1647. I came to Wotton, the place of my birth, to my\r\nbrother, and on the 10th to Hampton Court where I had the honor to kiss\r\nhis Majesty's hand, and give him an account of several things I had in\r\ncharge, he being now in the power of those execrable villains who not\r\nlong after murdered him. I lay at my cousin, Sergeant Hatton's at Thames\r\nDitton, whence, on the 13th, I went to London.\r\n\r\n14th October, 1647. To Sayes Court, at Deptford, in Kent (since my\r\nhouse), where I found Mr. Pretyman, my wife's uncle, who had charge of it\r\nand the estate about it, during my father-in-law's residence in France.\r\nOn the 15th, I again occupied my own chambers in the Middle Temple.\r\n\r\n9th November, 1647. My sister opened to me her marriage with Mr.\r\nGlanville.\r\n\r\n14th January, 1647-48. From London I went to Wotton to see my young\r\nnephew; and thence to Baynards [in Ewhurst], to visit my brother Richard.\r\n\r\n5th February, 1648. Saw a tragi-comedy acted in the cockpit, after there\r\nhad been none of these diversions for many years during the war.\r\n\r\n28th February, 1648. I went with my noble friend, Sir William Ducy\r\n(afterward Lord Downe), to Thistleworth, where we dined with Sir Clepesby\r\nCrew, and afterward to see the rare miniatures of Peter Oliver, and\r\nrounds of plaster, and then the curious flowers of Mr. Barill's garden,\r\nwho has some good medals and pictures. Sir Clepesby has fine Indian\r\nhangings, and a very good chimney-piece of water colors, by Breughel,\r\nwhich I bought for him.\r\n\r\n26th April, 1648. There was a great uproar in London, that the rebel army\r\nquartering at Whitehall, would plunder the City, on which there was\r\npublished a Proclamation for all to stand on their guard.\r\n\r\n4th May, 1648. Came up the Essex petitioners for an agreement between his\r\nMajesty and the rebels. The 16th, the Surrey men addressed the Parliament\r\nfor the same; of which some of them were slain and murdered by Cromwell's\r\nguards, in the new palace yard. I now sold the impropriation of South\r\nMalling, near Lewes, in Sussex, to Messrs. Kemp and Alcock, for £3,000.\r\n\r\n30th May, 1648. There was a rising now in Kent, my Lord of Norwich being\r\nat the head of them. Their first rendezvous was in Broome-field, next my\r\nhouse at Sayes Court, whence they went to Maidstone, and so to\r\nColchester, where was that memorable siege.\r\n\r\n27th June, 1648. I purchased the manor of Hurcott, in Worcestershire, of\r\nmy brother George, for £3,300.\r\n\r\n1st July, 1648. I sate for my picture, in which there is a Death's head,\r\nto Mr. Walker, that excellent painter.\r\n\r\n10th July, 1648. News was brought me of my Lord Francis Villiers being\r\nslain by the rebels near Kingston.\r\n\r\n16th August, 1648. I went to Woodcote (in Epsom) to the wedding of my\r\nbrother, Richard, who married the daughter and coheir of Esquire Minn,\r\nlately deceased; by which he had a great estate both in land and money on\r\nthe death of a brother. The coach in which the bride and bridegroom were,\r\nwas overturned in coming home; but no harm was done.\r\n\r\n28th August, 1648. To London from Sayes Court, and saw the celebrated\r\nfollies of Bartholomew Fair.\r\n\r\n16th September, 1648. Came my lately married brother, Richard, and his\r\nwife, to visit me, when I showed them Greenwich, and her Majesty's\r\nPalace, now possessed by the rebels.\r\n\r\n28th September, 1648. I went to Albury, to visit the Countess of Arundel,\r\nand returned to Wotton.\r\n\r\n31st October, 1648. I went to see my manor of Preston Beckhelvyn, and the\r\nCliffhouse.\r\n\r\n29th November, 1648. Myself, with Mr. Thomas Offley, and Lady Gerrard,\r\nchristened my niece Mary, eldest daughter of my brother, George Evelyn,\r\nby my Lady Cotton, his second wife. I presented my niece a piece of plate\r\nwhich cost me £18, and caused this inscription to be set on it--\r\n\r\n                            IN MEMORIAM FACTI.\r\n\r\n    ANNO CIC IX. XLIIX. CAL.

The Parliament now sat up the whole night, and\r\nendeavored to have concluded the Isle of Wight Treaty; but were surprised\r\nby the rebel army; the members dispersed, and great confusion every where\r\nin expectation of what would be next.\r\n\r\n17th December, 1648. I heard an Italian sermon, in Mercers' Chapel, one\r\nDr. Middleton, an acquaintance of mine, preaching.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n18th December, 1648. I got privately into the council of the rebel army,\r\nat Whitehall, where I heard horrid villanies.\r\n\r\nThis was a most exceedingly wet year, neither frost nor snow all the\r\nwinter for more than six days in all. Cattle died every where of a\r\nmurrain.\r\n\r\n1st January, 1648-49. I had a lodging and some books at my\r\nfather-in-law's house, Sayes Court.\r\n\r\n2d January, 1649. I went to see my old friend and fellow-traveler, Mr.\r\nHenshaw, who had two rare pieces of Stenwyck's perspective.\r\n\r\n17th January, 1649. To London. I heard the rebel, Peters, incite the\r\nrebel powers met in the Painted Chamber, to destroy his Majesty; and saw\r\nthat archtraitor, Bradshaw, who not long after condemned him.\r\n\r\n19th January, 1649. I returned home, passing an extraordinary danger of\r\nbeing drowned by our wherries falling foul in the night on another vessel\r\nthen at anchor, shooting the bridge at three quarters' ebb, for which His\r\nmercy God Almighty be praised.\r\n\r\n21st January, 1649. Was published my translation of Liberty and\r\nServitude, for the preface of which I was severely threatened.\r\n\r\n22d January, 1649. I went through a course of chemistry, at Sayes Court.\r\nNow was the Thames frozen over, and horrid tempests of wind.\r\n\r\nThe villany of the rebels proceeding now so far as to try, condemn, and\r\nmurder our excellent King on the 30th of this month, struck me with such\r\nhorror, that I kept the day of his martyrdom a fast, and would not be\r\npresent at that execrable wickedness; receiving the sad account of it\r\nfrom my brother George, and Mr. Owen, who came to visit me this\r\nafternoon, and recounted all the circumstances.\r\n\r\n1st February, 1649. Now were Duke Hamilton, the Earl of Norwich, Lord\r\nCapell, etc., at their trial before the rebels' NEW COURT OF INJUSTICE.\r\n\r\n15th February, 1649. I went to see the collection of one Trean, a rich\r\nmerchant, who had some good pictures, especially a rare perspective of\r\nStenwyck; from thence, to other virtuosos.\r\n\r\nThe painter, La Neve has an Andromeda, but I think it a copy after\r\nVandyke from Titian, for the original is in France. Webb, at the\r\nExchange, has some rare things in miniature, of Breughel's, also Putti,\r\nin twelve squares, that were plundered from Sir James Palmer.\r\n\r\nAt Du Bois, we saw two tables of Putti, that were gotten, I know not how,\r\nout of the Castle of St. Angelo, by old Petit, thought to be Titian's; he\r\nhad some good heads of Palma, and one of Stenwyck. Bellcar showed us an\r\nexcellent copy of his Majesty's Sleeping Venus and the Satyr, with other\r\nfigures; for now they had plundered, sold, and dispersed a world of rare\r\npaintings of the King's, and his loyal subjects. After all, Sir William\r\nDucy showed me some excellent things in miniature, and in oil of\r\nHolbein's; Sir Thomas More's head, and a whole-length figure of Edward\r\nVI., which were certainly his Majesty's; also a picture of Queen\r\nElizabeth; the Lady Isabella Thynne; a rare painting of Rothenhamer,\r\nbeing a Susanna; and a Magdalen, of Quintin, the blacksmith; also a Henry\r\nVIII., of Holbein; and Francis I., rare indeed, but of whose hand I know\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n16th February, 1649. Paris being now strictly besieged by the Prince de\r\nCondé, my wife being shut up with her father and mother, I wrote a letter\r\nof consolation to her: and, on the 22d, having recommended Obadiah\r\nWalker, a learned and most ingenious person, to be tutor to, and travel\r\nwith, Mr. Hillyard's two sons, returned to Sayes Court.\r\n\r\n25th February, 1649. Came to visit me Dr. Joyliffe, discoverer of the\r\nlymphatic vessels, and an excellent anatomist.\r\n\r\n26th February, 1649. Came to see me Captain George Evelyn, my kinsman,\r\nthe great traveler, and one who believed himself a better architect than\r\nreally he was; witness the portico in the Garden at Wotton; yet the great\r\nroom at Albury is somewhat better understood. He had a large mind, but\r\nover-built everything.\r\n\r\n27th February, 1649. Came out of France my wife's uncle (Paris still\r\nbesieged), being robbed at sea by the Dunkirk pirates: I lost, among\r\nother goods, my wife's picture, painted by Monsieur Bourdon.\r\n\r\n5th March, 1649. Now were the Lords murdered in the Palace Yard.\r\n\r\n18th March, 1649. Mr. Owen, a sequestered and learned minister, preached\r\nin my parlor, and gave us the blessed Sacrament, now wholly out of use in\r\nthe parish churches, on which the Presbyterians and fanatics had usurped.\r\n\r\n21st March, 1649. I received letters from Paris from my wife, and from\r\nSir Richard [Browne], with whom I kept up a political correspondence,\r\nwith no small danger of being discovered.\r\n\r\n25th March, 1649. I heard the Common Prayer (a rare thing in these days)\r\nin St. Peter's, at Paul's Wharf, London; and, in the morning, the\r\nArchbishop of Armagh, that pious person and learned man, Usher, in\r\nLincoln's-Inn Chapel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n2d April, 1649. To London, and inventoried my movables that had hitherto\r\nbeen dispersed for fear of plundering: wrote into France, touching my\r\nsudden resolutions of coming over to them. On the 8th, again heard an\r\nexcellent discourse from Archbishop Usher, on Ephes. 4, v. 26-27.\r\n\r\nMy Italian collection being now arrived, came Moulins, the great\r\nchirurgeon, to see and admire the Tables of Veins and Arteries, which I\r\npurchased and caused to be drawn out of several human bodies at Padua.\r\n\r\n11th April, 1649. Received news out of France that peace was concluded;\r\ndined with Sir Joseph Evelyn, at Westminster; and on the 13th I saw a\r\nprivate dissection at Moulins's house.\r\n\r\n17th April, 1649. I fell dangerously ill of my head; was blistered and\r\nlet bleed behind the ears and forehead: on the 23d, began to have ease by\r\nusing the fumes of camomile on embers applied to my ears, after all the\r\nphysicians had done their best.\r\n\r\n29th April, 1649. I saw in London a huge ox bred in Kent, 17 feet in\r\nlength, and much higher than I could reach.\r\n\r\n12th May, 1649. I purchased the manor of Warley Magna, in Essex: in the\r\nafternoon went to see Gildron's collections of paintings, where I found\r\nMr. Endymion Porter, of his late Majesty's bedchamber.\r\n\r\n17th May, 1649. Went to Putney by water, in the barge with divers ladies,\r\nto see the schools, or colleges, of the young gentlewomen.\r\n\r\n19th May, 1649. To see a rare cabinet of one Delabarr, who had some good\r\npaintings, especially a monk at his beads.\r\n\r\n30th May, 1649. Unkingship was proclaimed, and his Majesty's statues\r\nthrown down at St. Paul's Portico, and the Exchange.\r\n\r\n7th June, 1649. I visited Sir Arthur Hopton[38] (brother to Sir Ralph,\r\nLord Hopton, that noble hero), who having been Ambassador extraordinary\r\nin Spain, sojourned some time with my father-in-law at Paris, a most\r\nexcellent person. Also Signora Lucretia, a Greek lady, whom I knew in\r\nItaly, now come over with her husband, an English gentleman. Also, the\r\nEarl and Countess of Arundel, taking leave of them and other friends now\r\nready to depart for France. This night was a scuffle between some rebel\r\nsoldiers and gentlemen about the Temple.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 38: Sir Arthur Hopton was uncle, not brother, to Lord\r\n    Hopton (so well known for his services to Charles in the course of\r\n    the Civil War).]\r\n\r\nJune 10th, 1649. Preached the Archbishop of Armagh in Lincoln's-Inn, from\r\nRomans 5, verse 13. I received the blessed Sacrament, preparatory to my\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n13th June, 1649. I dined with my worthy friend, Sir John Owen, newly\r\nfreed from sentence of death among the lords that suffered. With him was\r\none Carew, who played incomparably on the Welsh harp; afterward I treated\r\ndivers ladies of my relations, in Spring Garden.\r\n\r\nThis night was buried with great pomp, Dorislaus, slain at the Hague, the\r\nvillain who managed the trial against his sacred Majesty.\r\n\r\n17th June, 1649. I got a pass from the rebel Bradshaw, then in great\r\npower.\r\n\r\n20th June, 1649. I went to Putney, and other places on the Thames, to\r\ntake prospects in crayon, to carry into France, where I thought to have\r\nthem engraved.\r\n\r\n2d July, 1649. I went from Wotton to Godstone (the residence of Sir John\r\nEvelyn), where was also Sir John Evelyn of Wilts., when I took leave of\r\nboth Sir Johns and their ladies. Mem. the prodigious memory of Sir John\r\nof Wilts' daughter, since married to Mr. W. Pierrepont, and mother of the\r\npresent Earl of Kingston. I returned to Sayes Court this night.\r\n\r\n4th July, 1649. Visited Lady Hatton, her lord sojourning at Paris with my\r\nfather-in-law.\r\n\r\n9th July, 1649. Dined with Sir Walter Pye, and my good friend, Mr. Eaton,\r\nafterward a judge, who corresponded with me in France.\r\n\r\n11th July, 1649. Came to see me old Alexander Rosse, the divine historian\r\nand poet; Mr. Henshaw, Mr. Scudamore, and other friends to take leave of\r\nme.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GRAVESEND]\r\n\r\n12th July, 1649. It was about three in the afternoon, I took oars for\r\nGravesend, accompanied by my cousin, Stephens, and sister, Glanville, who\r\nthere supped with me and returned; whence I took post immediately to\r\nDover, where I arrived by nine in the morning; and, about eleven that\r\nnight, went on board a barque guarded by a pinnace of eight guns; this\r\nbeing the first time the Packet-boat had obtained a convoy, having\r\nseveral times before been pillaged. We had a good passage, though chased\r\nfor some hours by a pirate, but he dared not attack our frigate, and we\r\nthen chased him till he got under the protection of the castle at Calais.\r\nIt was a small privateer belonging to the Prince of Wales. I carried over\r\nwith me my servant, Richard Hoare, an incomparable writer of several\r\nhands, whom I afterward preferred in the Prerogative Office, at the\r\nreturn of his Majesty. Lady Catherine Scott, daughter of the Earl of\r\nNorwich, followed us in a shallop, with Mr. Arthur Slingsby, who left\r\nEngland _incognito_. At the entrance of the town, the Lieutenant\r\nGovernor, being on his horse with the guards, let us pass courteously. I\r\nvisited Sir Richard Lloyd, an English gentleman, and walked in the\r\nchurch, where the ornament about the high altar of black marble is very\r\nfine, and there is a good picture of the Assumption. The citadel seems to\r\nbe impregnable, and the whole country about it to be laid under water by\r\nsluices for many miles.\r\n\r\n16th July, 1649. We departed from Paris, in company with that very\r\npleasant lady, Lady Catherine Scott, and others. In all this journey we\r\nwere greatly apprehensive of parties, which caused us to alight often out\r\nof our coach and walk separately on foot, with our guns on our shoulders,\r\nin all suspected places.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PARIS]\r\n\r\n1st August, 1649. At three in the afternoon we came to St. Denis, saw the\r\nrarities of the church and treasury; and so to Paris that evening.\r\n\r\nThe next day, came to welcome me at dinner the Lord High Treasurer\r\nCottington, Sir Edward Hyde, Chancellor, Sir Edward Nicholas, Secretary\r\nof State, Sir George Carteret, Governor of Jersey, and Dr. Earle, having\r\nnow been absent from my wife above a year and a half.\r\n\r\n18th August, 1649. I went to St. Germains, to kiss his Majesty's hand; in\r\nthe coach, which was my Lord Wilmot's, went Mrs. Barlow, the King's\r\nmistress[39] and mother to the Duke of Monmouth, a brown, beautiful,\r\nbold, but insipid creature.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 39: The lady here referred to was Lucy, daughter of\r\n    Richard Walters, Esq., of Haverfordwest. She had two children by the\r\n    King; James, subsequently so celebrated as the Duke of Monmouth, and\r\n    Mary, whose lot was obscure in comparison with that of her brother,\r\n    but of course infinitely happier. She married a Mr. William\r\n    Sarsfield, of Ireland, and after his death, William Fanshawe, Esq.]\r\n\r\n19th August, 1649. I went to salute the French King and the Queen\r\nDowager; and, on the 21st, returned in one of the Queen's coaches with my\r\nLord Germain, Duke of Buckingham, Lord Wentworth, and Mr. Croftes, since\r\nLord Croftes.\r\n\r\n7th September, 1649. Went with my wife and dear Cousin to St. Germains,\r\nand kissed the Queen-Mother's hand; dined with my Lord Keeper and Lord\r\nHatton. Divers of the great men of France came to see the King. The next\r\nday, came the Prince of Condé. Returning to Paris, we went to see the\r\nPresident Maison's palace, built castle-wise, of a milk-white fine\r\nfreestone; the house not vast, but well contrived, especially the\r\nstaircase, and the ornaments of Putti, about it. It is environed in a dry\r\nmoat, the offices under ground, the gardens very excellent with\r\nextraordinary long walks, set with elms, and a noble prospect toward the\r\nforest, and on the Seine toward Paris. Take it altogether, the meadows,\r\nwalks, river, forest, corn-ground, and vineyards, I hardly saw anything\r\nin Italy to exceed it. The iron gates are very magnificent. He has pulled\r\ndown a whole village to make room for his pleasure about it.\r\n\r\n12th September, 1649. Dr. Crighton, a Scotchman, and one of his Majesty's\r\nchaplains, a learned Grecian who set out the Council of Florence,\r\npreached.\r\n\r\n13th September, 1649. The King invited the Prince of Condé to supper at\r\nSt. Cloud; there I kissed the Duke of York's hand in the tennis court,\r\nwhere I saw a famous match between Monsieur Saumeurs and Colonel Cooke,\r\nand so returned to Paris. It was noised about that I was knighted, a\r\ndignity I often declined.\r\n\r\n1st October, 1649. Went with my cousin Tuke (afterward Sir Samuel), to\r\nsee the fountains of St. Cloud and Ruel; and, after dinner, to talk with\r\nthe poor ignorant and superstitious anchorite at Mount Calvary, and so to\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n2d October, 1649. Came Mr. William Coventry (afterward Sir William) and\r\nthe Duke's secretary, etc., to visit me.\r\n\r\n5th October, 1649. Dined with Sir George Ratcliffe, the great favorite of\r\nthe late Earl of Stratford, formerly Lord Deputy of Ireland, decapitated.\r\n\r\n7th October, 1649. To the Louvre, to visit the Countess of Moreton,\r\ngoverness to Madame.\r\n\r\n15th October, 1649. Came news of Drogheda being taken by the rebels, and\r\nall put to the sword, which made us very sad, forerunning the loss of all\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n21st October, 1649. I went to hear Dr. d'Avinson's lecture in the\r\nphysical garden, and see his laboratory, he being Prefect of that\r\nexcellent garden, and Professor Botanicus.\r\n\r\n30th October, 1649. I was at the funeral of one Mr. Downes, a sober\r\nEnglish gentleman. We accompanied his corpse to Charenton, where he was\r\ninterred in a cabbage-garden, yet with the office of our church, which\r\nwas said before in our chapel at Paris. Here I saw also where they buried\r\nthe great soldier, Gassion, who had a tomb built over him like a\r\nfountain, the design and materials mean enough. I returned to Paris with\r\nSir Philip Musgrave, and Sir Marmaduke Langdale, since Lord\r\nLangdale.--Memorandum. This was a very sickly and mortal autumn.\r\n\r\n5th November, 1649. I received divers letters out of England, requiring\r\nme to come over about settling some of my concerns.\r\n\r\n7th November, 1649. Dr. George Morley (since Bishop of Winchester)\r\npreached in our chapel on Matthew 4, verse 3.\r\n\r\n18th November, 1649. I went with my father-in-law to see his audience at\r\nthe French Court, where next the Pope's Nuncio, he was introduced by the\r\nmaster of ceremonies, and, after delivery of his credentials, as from our\r\nKing, since his father's murder, he was most graciously received by the\r\nKing of France and his mother, with whom he had a long audience. This was\r\nin the Palais Cardinal.\r\n\r\nAfter this, being presented to his Majesty and the Queen Regent I went to\r\nsee the house built by the late great Cardinal de Richelieu. The most\r\nobservable thing is the gallery, painted with the portraits of the most\r\nillustrious persons and single actions in France, with innumerable\r\nemblems between every table. In the middle of the gallery, is a neat\r\nchapel, rarely paved in work and devices of several sorts of marble,\r\nbesides the altar-piece and two statues of white marble, one of St. John,\r\nthe other of the Virgin Mary, by Bernini. The rest of the apartments are\r\nrarely gilded and carved, with some good modern paintings. In the\r\npresence hang three huge branches of crystal. In the French King's\r\nbedchamber, is an alcove like another chamber, set as it were in a\r\nchamber like a movable box, with a rich embroidered bed. The fabric of\r\nthe palace is not magnificent, being but of two stories; but the garden\r\nis so spacious as to contain a noble basin and fountain continually\r\nplaying, and there is a mall, with an elbow, or turning, to protract it.\r\nSo I left his Majesty on the terrace, busy in seeing a bull-baiting, and\r\nreturned home in Prince Edward's coach with Mr. Paul, the Prince\r\nElector's agent.\r\n\r\n19th November, 1649. Visited Mr. Waller, where meeting Dr. Holden, an\r\nEnglish Sorbonne divine, we fell into some discourse about religion.\r\n\r\n28th December, 1649. Going to wait on Mr. Waller, I viewed St. Stephen's\r\nchurch; the building, though Gothic, is full of carving; within it is\r\nbeautiful, especially the choir and winding stairs. The glass is well\r\npainted, and the tapestry hung up this day about the choir, representing\r\nthe conversion of Constantine, was exceedingly rich.\r\n\r\nI went to that excellent engraver, Du Bosse, for his instruction about\r\nsome difficulties in perspective which were delivered in his book.\r\n\r\nI concluded this year in health, for which I gave solemn thanks to\r\nAlmighty God.[40]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 40: This he does not fail to repeat at the end of every\r\n    year, but it will not always be necessary here to insert it.]\r\n\r\n29th December, 1649. I christened Sir Hugh Rilie's child with Sir George\r\nRadcliffe in our chapel, the parents being so poor that they had provided\r\nno gossips, so as several of us drawing lots it fell on me, the Dean of\r\nPeterborough (Dr. Cousin) officiating: we named it Andrew, being on the\r\neve of that Apostle's day.\r\n\r\n1st January, 1649-50. I began this Jubilee with the public office in our\r\nchapel: dined at my Lady Herbert's, wife of Sir Edward Herbert, afterward\r\nLord Keeper.\r\n\r\n18th January, 1650. This night was the Prince of Condé and his brother\r\ncarried prisoners to the Bois de Vincennes.\r\n\r\n6th February, 1650. In the evening, came Signor Alessandro, one of the\r\nCardinal Mazarine's musicians, and a person of great name for his\r\nknowledge in that art, to visit my wife, and sung before divers persons\r\nof quality in my chamber.\r\n\r\n1st March, 1650. I went to see the masquerados, which was very fantastic;\r\nbut nothing so quiet and solemn as I found it at Venice.\r\n\r\n13th March, 1650. Saw a triumph in Monsieur del Camp's Academy, where\r\ndivers of the French and English noblesse, especially my Lord of Ossory,\r\nand Richard, sons to the Marquis of Ormond (afterward Duke), did their\r\nexercises on horseback in noble equipage, before a world of spectators\r\nand great persons, men and ladies. It ended in a collation.\r\n\r\n25th April, 1650. I went out of town to see Madrid, a palace so called,\r\nbuilt by Francis I. It is observable only for its open manner of\r\narchitecture, being much of terraces and galleries one over another to\r\nthe very roof; and for the materials, which are mostly of earth painted\r\nlike porcelain, or China-ware, whose colors appear very fresh, but is\r\nvery fragile. There are whole statues and relievos of this pottery,\r\nchimney-pieces, and columns both within and without. Under the chapel is\r\na chimney in the midst of a room parted from the _Salle des Gardes_. The\r\nhouse is fortified with a deep ditch, and has an admirable vista toward\r\nthe Bois de Boulogne and river.\r\n\r\n30th April, 1650. I went to see the collection of the famous sculptor,\r\nSteffano de la Bella, returning now into Italy, and bought some prints;\r\nand likewise visited Perelle, the landscape graver.\r\n\r\n3d May, 1650. At the hospital of La Charité I saw the operation of\r\ncutting for the stone. A child of eight or nine years old underwent the\r\noperation with most extraordinary patience, and expressing great joy when\r\nhe saw the stone was drawn. The use I made of it was, to give Almighty\r\nGod hearty thanks that I had not been subject to this deplorable\r\ninfirmity.\r\n\r\n7th May, 1650. I went with Sir Richard Browne's lady and my wife,\r\ntogether with the Earl of Chesterfield, Lord Ossory and his brother, to\r\nVamber, a place near the city famous for butter; when, coming homeward,\r\nbeing on foot, a quarrel arose between Lord Ossory and a man in a garden,\r\nwho thrust Lord Ossory from the gate with uncivil language; on which our\r\nyoung gallants struck the fellow on the pate, and bade him ask pardon,\r\nwhich he did with much submission, and so we parted. But we were not gone\r\nfar before we heard a noise behind us, and saw people coming with guns,\r\nswords, staves, and forks, and who followed, flinging stones; on which,\r\nwe turned, and were forced to engage, and with our swords, stones, and\r\nthe help of our servants (one of whom had a pistol) made our retreat for\r\nnear a quarter of a mile, when we took shelter in a house, where we were\r\nbesieged, and at length forced to submit to be prisoners. Lord Hatton,\r\nwith some others, were taken prisoners in the flight, and his lordship\r\nwas confined under three locks and as many doors in this rude fellow's\r\nmaster's house, who pretended to be steward to Monsieur St. Germain, one\r\nof the presidents of the Grand Chambre du Parlement, and a Canon of Nôtre\r\nDame. Several of us were much hurt. One of our lackeys escaping to Paris,\r\ncaused the bailiff of St. Germain to come with his guard and rescue us.\r\nImmediately afterward, came Monsieur St. Germain himself, in great wrath,\r\non hearing that his housekeeper was assaulted; but when he saw the King's\r\nofficers, the gentlemen and noblemen, with his Majesty's Resident and\r\nunderstood the occasion, he was ashamed of the accident, requesting the\r\nfellow's pardon, and desiring the ladies to accept their submission and a\r\nsupper at his house. It was ten o'clock at night ere we got to Paris,\r\nguarded by Prince Griffith (a Welsh hero going under that name, and well\r\nknown in England for his extravagancies), together with the scholars of\r\ntwo academies, who came forth to assist and meet us on horseback, and\r\nwould fain have alarmed the town we received the affront from: which,\r\nwith much ado, we prevented.\r\n\r\n12th May, 1650. Complaint being come to the Queen and Court of France of\r\nthe affront we had received, the President was ordered to ask pardon of\r\nSir R. Browne, his Majesty's Resident, and the fellow to make submission,\r\nand be dismissed. There came along with him the President de Thou, son of\r\nthe great Thuanus [the historian], and so all was composed. But I have\r\noften heard that gallant gentleman, my Lord Ossory, affirm solemnly that\r\nin all the conflicts he was ever in at sea or on land (in the most\r\ndesperate of both which he had often been), he believed he was never in\r\nso much danger as when these people rose against us. He used to call it\r\nthe _bataile de Vambre_, and remember it with a great deal of mirth as an\r\nadventure, _en cavalier_.\r\n\r\n24th May, 1650. We were invited by the Noble Academies to a running at\r\nthe ring where were many brave horses, gallants, and ladies, my Lord\r\nStanhope entertaining us with a collation.\r\n\r\n12th June, 1650. Being Trinity Sunday, the Dean of Peterborough preached;\r\nafter which there was an ordination of two divines, Durell and Brevent\r\n(the one was afterward Dean of Windsor, the other of Durham, both very\r\nlearned persons). The Bishop of Galloway officiated with great gravity,\r\nafter a pious and learned exhortation declaring the weight and dignity of\r\ntheir function, especially now in a time of the poor Church of England's\r\naffliction. He magnified the sublimity of the calling, from the object,\r\nviz, the salvation of men's souls, and the glory of God; producing many\r\nhuman instances of the transitoriness and vanity of all other dignity;\r\nthat of all the triumphs the Roman conquerors made, none was comparable\r\nto that of our Blessed Savior's, when he led captivity captive, and gave\r\ngifts to men, namely, that of the Holy Spirit, by which his faithful and\r\npainful ministers triumphed over Satan as often as they reduced a sinner\r\nfrom the error of his ways. He then proceeded to the ordination. They\r\nwere presented by the Dean in their surplices before the altar, the\r\nBishop sitting in a chair at one side; and so were made both Deacons and\r\nPriests at the same time, in regard to the necessity of the times, there\r\nbeing so few Bishops left in England, and consequently danger of a\r\nfailure of both functions. Lastly, they proceeded to the Communion. This\r\nwas all performed in Sir Richard Browne's chapel, at Paris.\r\n\r\n13th June, 1650. I sate to the famous sculptor, Nanteuil, who was\r\nafterward made a knight by the French King for his art. He engraved my\r\npicture in copper. At a future time he presented me with my own picture,\r\ndone all with his pen; an extraordinary curiosity.\r\n\r\n21st June, 1650. I went to see the Samaritan, or pump, at the end of the\r\nPont Neuf, which, though to appearance promising no great matter, is,\r\nbesides the machine, furnished with innumerable rarities both of art and\r\nnature; especially the costly grotto, where are the fairest corals,\r\ngrowing out of the very rock, that I have seen; also great pieces of\r\ncrystals, amethysts, gold in the mine, and other metals and marcasites,\r\nwith two great conchas, which the owner told us cost him 200 crowns at\r\nAmsterdam. He showed us many landscapes and prospects, very rarely\r\npainted in miniature, some with the pen and crayon; divers antiquities\r\nand relievos of Rome; above all, that of the inside of the amphitheater\r\nof Titus, incomparably drawn by Monsieur St. Clere himself; two boys and\r\nthree skeletons, molded by Fiamingo; a book of statues, with the pen\r\nmade for Henry IV., rarely executed, and by which one may discover many\r\nerrors in the _taille-douce_ of Perrier, who has added divers conceits of\r\nhis own that are not in the originals. He has likewise an infinite\r\ncollection of _taille-douces_, richly bound in morocco.\r\n\r\nHe led us into a stately chamber furnished to have entertained a prince,\r\nwith pictures of the greatest masters, especially a Venus of Perino del\r\nVaga; the Putti carved in the chimney-piece by the Fleming; the vases of\r\nporcelain, and many designed by Raphael; some paintings of Poussin, and\r\nFioravanti; antiques in brass; the looking-glass and stands rarely\r\ncarved. In a word, all was great, choice, and magnificent, and not to be\r\npassed by as I had often done, without the least suspicion that there\r\nwere such rare things to be seen in that place. At a future visit, he\r\nshowed a new grotto and a bathing place, hewn through the battlements of\r\nthe arches of Pont Neuf into a wide vault at the intercolumniation, so\r\nthat the coaches and horses thundered over our heads.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CALAIS]\r\n\r\n27th June, 1650. I made my will, and, taking leave of my wife and other\r\nfriends, took horse for England, paying the messenger eight pistoles for\r\nme and my servant to Calais, setting out with seventeen in company\r\nwell-armed, some Portuguese, Swiss, and French, whereof six were captains\r\nand officers. We came the first night to Beaumont; next day, to Beauvais,\r\nand lay at Pois, and the next, without dining, reached Abbeville; next,\r\ndined at Montreuil, and proceeding met a company on foot (being now\r\nwithin the inroads of the parties which dangerously infest this day's\r\njourney from St. Omers and the frontiers), which we drew very near to,\r\nready and resolute to charge through, and accordingly were ordered and\r\nled by a captain of our train; but, as we were on the speed, they called\r\nout, and proved to be Scotchmen, newly raised and landed, and few among\r\nthem armed. This night, we were well treated at Boulogne. The next day,\r\nwe marched in good order, the passage being now exceeding dangerous, and\r\ngot to Calais by a little after two. The sun so scorched my face, that it\r\nmade the skin peel off.\r\n\r\nI dined with Mr. Booth, his Majesty's agent; and, about three in the\r\nafternoon, embarked in the packet-boat; hearing there was a pirate then\r\nalso setting sail, we had security from molestation, and so with a fair\r\nS. W. wind in seven hours we landed at Dover. The busy watchman would\r\nhave us to the mayor to be searched, but the gentleman being in bed, we\r\nwere dismissed.\r\n\r\nNext day, being Sunday, they would not permit us to ride post, so that\r\nafternoon our trunks were visited.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, by four, we set out for Canterbury, where I met with my\r\nLady Catherine Scott, whom that very day twelve months before I met at\r\nsea going for France; she had been visiting Sir Thomas Peyton, not far\r\noff, and would needs carry me in her coach to Gravesend. We dined at\r\nSittingbourne, came late to Gravesend, and so to Deptford, taking leave\r\nof my lady about four the next morning.\r\n\r\n5th July, 1650. I supped in the city with my Lady Catherine Scott, at one\r\nMr. Dubois, where was a gentlewoman called Everard, who was a very great\r\nchemist.\r\n\r\nSunday 7th July, 1650. In the afternoon, having a mind to see what was\r\ndoing among the Rebels, then in full possession at Whitehall, I went\r\nthither, and found one at exercise in the chapel, after their way;\r\nthence, to St. James's, where another was preaching in the court abroad.\r\n\r\n17th July, 1650. I went to London to obtain a pass,[41] intending but a\r\nshort stay in England.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 41: A copy of it is subjoined. \"These are to will and\r\n    require you to permit and suffer the bearer thereof, John Evelyn,\r\n    Esq., to transport himself, two servants, and other necessaries,\r\n    into any port of France without any your lets or molestations, of\r\n    which you are not to fail, and for which this shall be your\r\n    sufficient warrant. Given at the Council of State at Whitehall this\r\n    25th of June, 1650.\r\n\r\n      \"Signed in the Name and by Order of the Council of State,\r\n       appointed by authority of Parliament,\r\n       JO. BRADSHAWE, President.\r\n\r\n    \"To all Customers, Comptrollers and Searchers, and all other\r\n    officers of the Ports, or Customs.\"\r\n\r\n    Subjoined to the signature, Evelyn has added in his own writing;\r\n    \"The hand of that villain who sentenced our Charles I. of B[lessed]\r\n    M[emory.\"] Its endorsement, also in his writing, is, \"The Pass from\r\n    the Council of State, 1650.\"]\r\n\r\n25th July, 1650. I went by Epsom to Wotton, saluting Sir Robert Cook and\r\nmy sister Glanville; the country was now much molested by soldiers, who\r\ntook away gentlemen's horses for the service of the state, as then\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\n4th August, 1650. I heard a sermon at the Rolls; and, in the afternoon,\r\nwandered to divers churches, the pulpits full of novices and novelties.\r\n\r\n6th August, 1650. To Mr. Walker's, a good painter, who showed me an\r\nexcellent copy of Titian.\r\n\r\n12th August, 1650. Set out for Paris, taking post at Gravesend, and so\r\nthat night to Canterbury, where being surprised by the soldiers, and\r\nhaving only an antiquated pass, with some fortunate dexterity I got clear\r\nof them though not without extraordinary hazard, having before\r\ncounterfeited one with success, it being so difficult to procure one of\r\nthe rebels without entering into oaths, which I never would do. At Dover,\r\nmoney to the searchers and officers was as authentic as the hand and seal\r\nof Bradshawe himself, where I had not so much as my trunk opened.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CALAIS]\r\n\r\n13th August, 1650. At six in the evening, set sail for Calais; the wind\r\nnot favorable, I was very sea-sick, coming to an anchor about one\r\no'clock; about five in the morning, we had a long boat to carry us to\r\nland, though at a good distance; this we willingly entered, because two\r\nvessels were chasing us; but, being now almost at the harbor's mouth,\r\nthrough inadvertency there broke in upon us two such heavy seas, as had\r\nalmost sunk the boat, I being near the middle up in water. Our steersman,\r\nit seems, apprehensive of the danger, was preparing to leap into the sea\r\nand trust to swimming, but seeing the vessel emerge, he put her into the\r\npier, and so, God be thanked! we got to Calais, though wet.\r\n\r\nHere I waited for company, the passage toward Paris being still infested\r\nwith volunteers from the Spanish frontiers.\r\n\r\n16th August, 1650. The Regiment of Picardy, consisting of about 1,400\r\nhorse and foot (among them was a captain whom I knew), being come to\r\ntown, I took horses for myself and servant, and marched under their\r\nprotection to Boulogne. It was a miserable spectacle to see how these\r\ntattered soldiers pillaged the poor people of their sheep, poultry, corn,\r\ncattle, and whatever came in their way; but they had such ill pay, that\r\nthey were ready themselves to starve.\r\n\r\nAs we passed St. Denis, the people were in uproar, the guards doubled,\r\nand everybody running with their movables to Paris, on an alarm that the\r\nenemy was within five leagues of them; so miserably exposed was even this\r\npart of France at this time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PARIS]\r\n\r\nThe 30th, I got to Paris, after an absence of two months only.\r\n\r\n1st September, 1650. My Lady Herbert invited me to dinner; Paris, and\r\nindeed all France, being full of loyal fugitives.\r\n\r\nCame Mr. Waller to see me, about a child of his which the Popish midwife\r\nhad baptized.\r\n\r\n15th October, 1650. Sir Thomas Osborne (afterward Lord Treasurer) and\r\nLord Stanhope shot for a wager of five louis, to be spent on a treat;\r\nthey shot so exact that it was a drawn match.\r\n\r\n1st November, 1650. Took leave of my Lord Stanhope, going on his journey\r\ntoward Italy; also visited my Lord Hatton, Comptroller of his Majesty's\r\nHousehold, the Countess of Morton, Governess to the Lady Henrietta, and\r\nMrs. Gardner, one of the Queen's maids of honor.\r\n\r\n6th November, 1650. Sir Thomas Osborne supping with us, his groom was set\r\nupon in the street before our house, and received two wounds, but gave\r\nthe assassin nine, who was carried off to the Charité Hospital. Sir\r\nThomas went for England on the 8th, and carried divers letters for me to\r\nmy friends.\r\n\r\n16th November, 1650. I went to Monsieur Visse's, the French King's\r\nSecretary, to a concert of French music and voices, consisting of\r\ntwenty-four, two theorbos, and but one bass viol, being a rehearsal of\r\nwhat was to be sung at vespers at St. Cecilia's, on her feast, she being\r\npatroness of Musicians. News arrived of the death of the Princess of\r\nOrange of the smallpox.\r\n\r\n14th December, 1650. I went to visit Mr. Ratcliffe, in whose lodging was\r\nan imposter that had liked to have imposed upon us a pretended secret of\r\nmultiplying gold; it is certain he had lived some time in Paris in\r\nextraordinary splendor, but I found him to be an egregious cheat.\r\n\r\n22d December, 1650. Came the learned Dr. Boet to visit me.\r\n\r\n31st December, 1650. I gave God thanks for his mercy and protection the\r\npast year, and made up my accounts, which came this year to 7,015 livres,\r\nnear £600 sterling.\r\n\r\n1st January, 1650-51. I wrote to my brother at Wotton, about his garden\r\nand fountains. After evening prayer, Mr. Wainsford called on me: he had\r\nlong been Consul at Aleppo, and told me many strange things of those\r\ncountries, the Arabs especially.\r\n\r\n27th January, 1651. I had letters of the death of Mrs. Newton, my\r\ngrand-mother-in-law; she had a most tender care of me during my\r\nchildhood, and was a woman of extraordinary charity and piety.\r\n\r\n29th January, 1651. Dr. Duncan preached on 8 Matt. v. 34, showing the\r\nmischief of covetousness. My Lord Marquis of Ormonde and Inchiquin, come\r\nnewly out of Ireland, were this day at chapel.\r\n\r\n9th February, 1651. Cardinal Mazarin was proscribed by Arrêt du\r\nParlement, and great commotions began in Paris.\r\n\r\n23d February, 1651. I went to see the Bonnes Hommes, a convent that has a\r\nfair cloister painted with the lives of hermits; a glorious altar now\r\nerecting in the chapel; the garden on the rock with divers descents, with\r\na fine vineyard, and a delicate prospect toward the city.\r\n\r\n24th February, 1651. I went to see a dromedary, a very monstrous beast,\r\nmuch like the camel, but larger. There was also dancing on the rope; but,\r\nabove all, surprising to those who were ignorant of the address, was the\r\nwater-spouter, who, drinking only fountain-water, rendered out of his\r\nmouth in several glasses all sorts of wine and sweet waters. For a piece\r\nof money he discovered the secret to me. I waited on Friar Nicholas at\r\nthe convent at Chaillot, who, being an excellent chemist, showed me his\r\nlaboratory, and rare collection of spagyrical remedies. He was both\r\nphysician and apothecary of the convent, and, instead of the names of his\r\ndrugs, he painted his boxes and pots with the figure of the drug, or\r\nsimple, contained in them. He showed me as a rarity some [Transcriber's\r\nnote: special symbol for the planet Mercury] of antimony. He had cured\r\nMonsieur Senatin of a desperate sickness, for which there was building a\r\nmonumental altar that was to cost £1,500.\r\n\r\n11th March, 1651. I went to the Châtelet, or prison, where a malefactor\r\nwas to have the question, or torture, given to him, he refusing to\r\nconfess the robbery with which he was charged, which was thus: they first\r\nbound his wrist with a strong rope, or small cable, and one end of it to\r\nan iron ring made fast to the wall, about four feet from the floor, and\r\nthen his feet with another cable, fastened about five feet further than\r\nhis utmost length to another ring on the floor of the room. Thus\r\nsuspended, and yet lying but aslant, they slid a horse of wood under the\r\nrope which bound his feet, which so exceedingly stiffened it, as severed\r\nthe fellow's joints in miserable sort, drawing him out at length in an\r\nextraordinary manner, he having only a pair of linen drawers on his naked\r\nbody. Then, they questioned him of a robbery (the lieutenant being\r\npresent and a clerk that wrote), which not confessing, they put a higher\r\nhorse under the rope, to increase the torture and extension. In this\r\nagony, confessing nothing, the executioner with a horn (just such as they\r\ndrench horses with) stuck the end of it into his mouth, and poured the\r\nquantity of two buckets of water down his throat and over him, which so\r\nprodigiously swelled him, as would have pitied and affrighted any one to\r\nsee it; for all this, he denied all that was charged to him. They then\r\nlet him down, and carried him before a warm fire to bring him to himself,\r\nbeing now to all appearance dead with pain. What became of him, I know\r\nnot; but the gentleman whom he robbed constantly averred him to be the\r\nman, and the fellow's suspicious pale looks, before he knew he should be\r\nracked, betrayed some guilt; the lieutenant was also of that opinion, and\r\ntold us at first sight (for he was a lean, dry, black young man) he would\r\nconquer the torture; and so it seems they could not hang him, but did use\r\nin such cases, where the evidence is very presumptive, to send them to\r\nthe galleys, which is as bad as death.\r\n\r\nThere was another malefactor to succeed, but the spectacle was so\r\nuncomfortable, that I was not able to stay the sight of another. It\r\nrepresented yet to me the intolerable sufferings which our Blessed Savior\r\nmust needs undergo, when his body was hanging with all its weight upon\r\nthe nails on the cross.\r\n\r\n20th March, 1651. I went this night with my wife to a ball at the Marquis\r\nde Crevecoeur's, where were divers princes, dukes, and great persons;\r\nbut what appeared to me very mean was, that it began with a puppet-play.\r\n\r\n6th May, 1651. I attended the ambassador to a masque at Court, where the\r\nFrench King in person danced five entries, but being engaged in\r\ndiscourse, and better entertained with one of the Queen-Regent's\r\nsecretaries, I soon left the entertainment.\r\n\r\n11th May, 1651. To the Palace Cardinal, where the Master of the\r\nCeremonies placed me to see the royal masque, or opera. The first scene\r\nrepresented a chariot of singers composed of the rarest voices that could\r\nbe procured, representing Cornaro[42] and Temperance; this was overthrown\r\nby Bacchus and his revelers; the rest consisted of several entries and\r\npageants of excess, by all the elements. A masque representing fire was\r\nadmirable; then came a Venus out of the clouds. The conclusion was a\r\nheaven, whither all ascended. But the glory of the masque was the great\r\npersons performing in it, the French King, his brother the Duke of Anjou,\r\nwith all the grandees of the Court, the King performing to the admiration\r\nof all. The music was twenty-nine violins, vested _à l'antique_, but the\r\nhabits of the masquers were stupendously rich and glorious.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42: The famous Venetian writer on Temperance.]\r\n\r\n23d May, 1651. I went to take leave of the ambassadors for Spain, which\r\nwere my Lord Treasurer Cottington and Sir Edward Hyde; and, as I\r\nreturned, I visited Mr. Morine's garden, and his other rarities,\r\nespecially corals, minerals, stones, and natural curiosities; crabs of\r\nthe Red Sea, the body no bigger than a small bird's egg, but flatter, and\r\nthe two legs, or claws, a foot in length. He had abundance of shells, at\r\nleast 1,000 sorts, which furnished a cabinet of great price; and had a\r\nvery curious collection of scarabees and insects, of which he was\r\ncompiling a natural history. He had also the pictures of his choice\r\nflowers and plants in miniature. He told me there were 10,000 sorts of\r\ntulips only. He had _taille-douces_ out of number; the head of the\r\nrhinoceros bird, which was very extravagant, and one butterfly resembling\r\na perfect bird.\r\n\r\n25th May, 1651. I went to visit Mr. Thomas White, a learned priest and\r\nfamous philosopher,[43] author of the book \"De Mundo,\" with whose worthy\r\nbrother I was well acquainted at Rome. I was shown a cabinet of\r\nMaroquin, or Turkey leather, so curiously inlaid with other leather, and\r\ngilding, that the workman demanded for it 800 livres.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 43: A native of Essex, who was born in 1582, educated\r\n    abroad, and, his family being Catholic, became a priest of that\r\n    church, the sub-rector of the college at Douay. He advocated the\r\n    Cartesian philosophy, and this brought him into an extensive\r\n    correspondence with Hobbes and Descartes, in the course of which he\r\n    Latinized his name into Thomas Albius, or De Albis. He died in\r\n    1676.]\r\n\r\nThe Dean (of Peterborough) preached on the feast of Pentecost,\r\nperstringing those of Geneva for their irreverence of the Blessed Virgin.\r\n\r\n4th June, 1651. Trinity Sunday, I was absent from church in the afternoon\r\non a charitable affair for the Abbess of Bourcharvant, who but for me had\r\nbeen abused by that chemist, Du Menie. Returning, I stepped into the\r\nGrand Jesuits, who had this high day exposed their Cibarium, made all of\r\nsolid gold and imagery, a piece of infinite cost. Dr. Croydon, coming out\r\nof Italy and from Padua, came to see me, on his return to England.\r\n\r\n5th June, 1651. I accompanied my Lord Strafford, and some other noble\r\npersons, to hear Madam Lavaran sing, which she did both in French and\r\nItalian excellently well, but her voice was not strong.\r\n\r\n7th June, 1651. Corpus Christi Day, there was a grand procession, all the\r\nstreets tapestried, several altars erected there, full of images, and\r\nother rich furniture, especially that before the Court, of a rare design\r\nand architecture. There were abundance of excellent pictures and great\r\nvases of silver.\r\n\r\n13th June, 1651. I went to see the collection of one Monsieur Poignant,\r\nwhich for variety of agates, crystals, onyxes, porcelain, medals,\r\nstatues, relievos, paintings, _taille-douces_, and antiquities, might\r\ncompare with the Italian virtuosos.\r\n\r\n21st June, 1651. I became acquainted with Sieur William Curtius, a very\r\nlearned and judicious person of the Palatinate. He had been a scholar to\r\nAlstedius, the Encyclopedist, was well advanced in years, and now\r\nResident for his Majesty at Frankfort.\r\n\r\n2d July, 1651. Came to see me the Earl of Strafford, Lord Ossory and his\r\nbrother, Sir John Southcott, Sir Edward Stawell, two of my Lord Spencer's\r\nsons, and Dr. Stewart, Dean of St. Paul's, a learned and pious man, where\r\nwe entertained the time upon several subjects, especially the affairs of\r\nEngland, and the lamentable condition of our Church. The Lord Gerrard\r\nalso called to see my collection of sieges and battles.\r\n\r\n21st July, 1651. An extraordinary fast was celebrated in our Chapel, Dr.\r\nStewart, Dean of St. Paul's, preaching.\r\n\r\n2d August, 1651. I went with my wife to Conflans, where were abundance of\r\nladies and others bathing in the river; the ladies had their tents spread\r\non the water for privacy.\r\n\r\n29th August, 1651. Was kept as a solemn fast for the calamities of our\r\npoor Church, now trampled on by the rebels. Mr. Waller, being at St.\r\nGermains, desired me to send him a coach from Paris, to bring my wife's\r\ngoddaughter to Paris, to be buried by the Common Prayer.\r\n\r\n6th September, 1651. I went with my wife to St. Germains, to condole with\r\nMr. Waller's loss. I carried with me and treated at dinner that excellent\r\nand pious person the Dean of St. Paul's, Dr. Stewart, and Sir Lewis Dives\r\n(half-brother to the Earl of Bristol), who entertained us with his\r\nwonderful escape out of prison in Whitehall, the very evening before he\r\nwas to have been put to death, leaping down out of a jakes two stories\r\nhigh into the Thames at high water, in the coldest of winter, and at\r\nnight; so as by swimming he got to a boat that attended for him, though\r\nhe was guarded by six musketeers. After this, he went about in women's\r\nhabit, and then in a small-coal-man's, traveling 200 miles on foot,\r\nembarked for Scotland with some men he had raised, who coming on shore\r\nwere all surprised and imprisoned on the Marquis of Montrose's score; he\r\nnot knowing anything of their barbarous murder of that hero. This he told\r\nus was his fifth escape, and none less miraculous; with this note, that\r\nthe charging through 1,000 men armed, or whatever danger could befall a\r\nman, he believed could not more confound and distract a man's thoughts\r\nthan the execution of a premeditated escape, the passions of hope and\r\nfear being so strong. This knight was indeed a valiant gentleman; but not\r\na little given to romance, when he spoke of himself. I returned to Paris\r\nthe same evening.\r\n\r\n7th September, 1651. I went to visit Mr. Hobbes, the famous philosopher\r\nof Malmesbury, with whom I had long acquaintance. From his window we saw\r\nthe whole equipage and glorious cavalcade of the young French Monarch,\r\nLouis XIV., passing to Parliament, when first he took the kingly\r\ngovernment on him, now being in his 14th year, out of his minority and\r\nthe Queen Regent's pupilage. First came the captain of the King's Aids,\r\nat the head of 50, richly liveried; next, the Queen-Mother's Light Horse,\r\n100, the lieutenant being all over covered with embroidery and ribbons,\r\nhaving before him four trumpets habited in black velvet, full of lace,\r\nand casques of the same. Then, the King's Light Horse, 200, richly\r\nhabited, with four trumpets in blue velvet embroidered with gold, before\r\nwhom rode the Count d'Olonne coronet [cornet], whose belt was set with\r\npearl. Next went the grand Prévôt's company on foot, with the Prévôt on\r\nhorseback; after them, the Swiss in black velvet toques, led by two\r\ngallant cavaliers habited in scarlet-colored satin, after their country\r\nfashion, which is very fantastic; he had in his cap a _pennach_ of heron,\r\nwith a band of diamonds, and about him twelve little Swiss boys, with\r\nhalberds. Then, came the _Aide des Cérémonies_; next, the grandees of\r\ncourt, governors of places and lieutenants-general of provinces,\r\nmagnificently habited and mounted; among whom I must not forget the\r\nChevalier Paul, famous for many sea-fights and signal exploits there,\r\nbecause it is said he had never been an Academist, and yet governed a\r\nvery unruly horse, and besides his rich suit his Malta Cross was esteemed\r\nat 10,000 crowns. These were headed by two trumpets, and the whole troop,\r\ncovered with gold, jewels, and rich caparisons, were followed by six\r\ntrumpets in blue velvet also, preceding as many heralds in blue velvet\r\n_semée_ with fleurs-de-lis, caduces in their hands, and velvet caps on\r\ntheir heads; behind them, came one of the masters of the ceremonies;\r\nthen, divers marshals and many of the nobility, exceeding splendid;\r\nbehind them Count d'Harcourt, grand Ecuyer, alone, carrying the King's\r\nsword in a scarf, which he held up in a blue sheath studded with\r\nfleurs-de-lis; his horse had for reins two scarfs of black taffeta.\r\n\r\nThen came abundance of footmen and pages of the King, new-liveried with\r\nwhite and red feathers; next, the _garde du corps_ and other officers;\r\nand lastly, appeared the King himself on an Isabella barb, on which a\r\nhousing _semee_, with crosses of the Order of the Holy Ghost, and\r\nfleurs-de-lis; the King himself, like a young Apollo, was in a suit so\r\ncovered with rich embroidery, that one could perceive nothing of the\r\nstuff under it; he went almost the whole way with his hat in hand,\r\nsaluting the ladies and acclamators, who had filled the windows with\r\ntheir beauty, and the air with _Vive le Roi_. He seemed a prince of a\r\ngrave yet sweet countenance. After the King, followed divers great\r\npersons of the Court, exceeding splendid, also his esquires; masters of\r\nhorse, on foot; then the company of _Exempts des Gardes_, and six guards\r\nof Scotch. Between their files were divers princes of the blood, dukes,\r\nand lords; after all these, the Queen's guard of Swiss, pages, and\r\nfootmen; then, the Queen-Mother herself, in a rich coach, with Monsieur\r\nthe King's brother, the Duke of Orleans, and some other lords and ladies\r\nof honor. About the coach, marched her _Exempts des Gardes_: then the\r\ncompany of the King's _Gens d'armes_, well mounted, 150, with four\r\ntrumpets, and as many of the Queen's; lastly, an innumerable company of\r\ncoaches full of ladies and gallants. In this equipage, passed the monarch\r\nto the Parliament, henceforth exercising his kingly government.\r\n\r\n15th September, 1651. I accompanied Sir Richard Browne, my father-in-law,\r\nto the French Court, when he had a favorable audience of the French King,\r\nand the Queen, his mother; congratulating the one on his coming to the\r\nexercise of his royal charge, and the other's prudent and happy\r\nadministration during her late regency, desiring both to preserve the\r\nsame amity for his master, our King, as they had hitherto done, which\r\nthey both promised, with many civil expressions and words of course upon\r\nsuch occasions. We were accompanied both going and returning by the\r\nIntroductor of Ambassadors and Aid of Ceremonies. I also saw the audience\r\nof Morosini, the Ambassador of Venice, and divers other Ministers of\r\nState from German Princes, Savoy, etc. Afterward I took a walk in the\r\nKing's gardens, where I observed that the mall goes the whole square\r\nthere of next the wall, and bends with an angle so made as to glance the\r\nwall; the angle is of stone. There is a basin at the end of the garden\r\nfed by a noble fountain and high jetto. There were in it two or three\r\nboats, in which the King now and then rows about. In another part is a\r\ncomplete fort, made with bastions, graft, half-moons, ravelins, and\r\nfurnished with great guns cast on purpose to instruct the King in\r\nfortification.\r\n\r\n22d September, 1651. Arrived the news of the fatal battle at Worcester,\r\nwhich exceedingly mortified our expectations.\r\n\r\n28th September, 1651. I was shown a collection of books and prints made\r\nfor the Duke of York.\r\n\r\n1st October, 1651. The Dean of Peterborough [Dr. Cosin] preached on Job\r\nxiii., verse 15, encouraging our trust in God on all events and\r\nextremities, and for establishing and comforting some ladies of great\r\nquality, who were then to be discharged from our Queen-Mother's service\r\nunless they would go over to the Romish Mass.\r\n\r\nThe Dean, dining this day at our house, told me the occasion of\r\npublishing those Offices, which among the Puritans were wont to be called\r\nCOSIN'S COZENING DEVOTIONS, by way of derision. At the first coming of\r\nthe Queen into England, she and her French ladies were often upbraiding\r\nour religion, that had neither appointed nor set forth any hours of\r\nprayer, or breveries, by which ladies and courtiers, who have much spare\r\ntime, might edify and be in devotion, as they had. Our Protestant ladies,\r\nscandalized it seems at this, moved the matter to the King; whereupon his\r\nMajesty presently called Bishop White to him and asked his thoughts of\r\nit, and whether there might not be found some forms of prayer proper on\r\nsuch occasions, collected out of some already approved forms, that so the\r\ncourt ladies and others (who spent much time in trifling) might at least\r\nappear as devout, and be so too, as the new-come-over French ladies, who\r\ntook occasion to reproach our want of zeal and religion. On which, the\r\nBishop told his Majesty that it might be done easily, and was very\r\nnecessary; whereupon the King commanded him to employ some person of the\r\nclergy to compile such a Work, and presently the Bishop naming Dr. Cosin,\r\nthe King enjoined him to charge the Doctor in his name to set about it\r\nimmediately. This the Dean told me he did; and three months after,\r\nbringing the book to the King, he commanded the Bishop of London to read\r\nit over, and make his report; this was so well liked, that (contrary to\r\nformer custom of doing it by a chaplain) he would needs give it an\r\n_imprimatur_ under his own hand. Upon this there were at first only 200\r\ncopies printed; nor, said he, was there anything in the whole book of my\r\nown composure, nor did I set any name as author to it, but those\r\nnecessary prefaces, etc., out of the Fathers, touching the times and\r\nseasons of prayer; all the rest being entirely translated and collected\r\nout of an OFFICE published by authority of Queen Elizabeth, anno 1560,\r\nand our own Liturgy. This I rather mention to justify that industrious\r\nand pious Dean, who had exceedingly suffered by it, as if he had done it\r\nof his own head to introduce Popery, from which no man was more averse,\r\nand one who in this time of temptation and apostacy held and confirmed\r\nmany to our Church.\r\n\r\n29th October, 1651. Came news and letters to the Queen and Sir Richard\r\nBrowne (who was the first that had intelligence of it) of his Majesty's\r\nmiraculous escape after the fight at Worcester; which exceedingly\r\nrejoiced us.\r\n\r\n7th November, 1651. I visited Sir Kenelm Digby, with whom I had much\r\ndiscourse on chemical matters. I showed him a particular way of\r\nextracting oil of sulphur, and he gave me a certain powder with which he\r\naffirmed that he had fixed [Transcriber's note: special symbol for the\r\nplanet Mercury] (mercury) before the late King. He advised me to try and\r\ndigest a little better, and gave me a water which he said was only rain\r\nwater of the autumnal equinox, exceedingly rectified, very volatile; it\r\nhad a taste of a strong vitriolic, and smelt like _aqua fortis_. He\r\nintended it for a dissolvent of calx of gold; but the truth is, Sir\r\nKenelm was an arrant mountebank. Came news of the gallant Earl of Derby's\r\nexecution by the rebels.\r\n\r\n14th November, 1651. Dr. Clare preached on Genesis xxviii., verses 20,\r\n21, 22, upon Jacob's vow, which he appositely applied, it being the first\r\nSunday his Majesty came to chapel after his escape. I went, in the\r\nafternoon, to visit the Earl of Norwich; he lay at the Lord of Aubigny's.\r\n\r\n16th November, 1651. Visited Dean Stewart, who had been sick about two\r\ndays; when, going up to his lodging, I found him dead; which affected me\r\nmuch, as besides his particular affection and love to me, he was of\r\nincomparable parts and great learning, of exemplary life, and a very\r\ngreat loss to the whole church. He was buried the next day with all our\r\nchurch's ceremonies, many noble persons accompanying the corpse.\r\n\r\n17th November, 1651. I went to congratulate the marriage of Mrs. Gardner,\r\nmaid of honor, lately married to that odd person, Sir Henry Wood: but\r\nriches do many things.\r\n\r\nTo see Monsieur Febure's course of chemistry, where I found Sir Kenelm\r\nDigby, and divers curious persons of learning and quality. It was his\r\nfirst opening the course and preliminaries, in order to operations.\r\n\r\n1st December, 1651. I now resolved to return to England.\r\n\r\n3d December, 1651. Sir Lewis Dives dined with us, who relating some of\r\nhis adventures, showed me divers pieces of broad gold, which, being in\r\nhis pocket in a fight, preserved his life by receiving a musket bullet on\r\nthem, which deadened its violence, so that it went no further; but made\r\nsuch a stroke on the gold as fixed the impressions upon one another,\r\nbattering and bending several of them; the bullet itself was flatted, and\r\nretained on it the color of the gold. He assured us that of a hundred of\r\nthem, which it seems he then had in his pocket, not one escaped without\r\nsome blemish. He affirmed that his being protected by a Neapolitan\r\nPrince, who connived at his bringing some horses into France, contrary to\r\nthe order of the Viceroy, by assistance of some banditti, was the\r\noccasion of a difference between those great men, and consequently of the\r\nlate civil war in that kingdom, the Viceroy having killed the Prince\r\nstanding on his defense at his own castle. He told me that the second\r\ntime of the Scots coming into England, the King was six times their\r\nnumber, and might easily have beaten them; but was betrayed, as were all\r\nother his designs and counsels, by some, even of his bedchamber, meaning\r\nM. Hamilton, who copied Montrose's letters from time to time when his\r\nMajesty was asleep.\r\n\r\n11th December, 1651. Came to visit me, Mr. Obadiah Walker, of University\r\nCollege, with his two pupils, the sons of my worthy friend, Henry\r\nHyldiard, Esq., whom I had recommended to his care.\r\n\r\n21st December, 1651. Came to visit my wife, Mrs. Lane,[44] the lady who\r\nconveyed the King to the seaside at his escape from Worcester. Mr. John\r\nCosin, son of the Dean, debauched by the priests, wrote a letter to me\r\nto mediate for him with his father. I prepared for my last journey, being\r\nnow resolved to leave France altogether.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 44: Sister of Colonel Lane, an English officer in the army\r\n    of Charles II. dispersed at the battle of Worcester. She assisted\r\n    the King in effecting his escape after that battle, his Majesty\r\n    traveling with her disguised as her serving man, William Jackson.]\r\n\r\n25th December, 1651. The King and Duke received the Sacrament first by\r\nthemselves, the Lords Byron and Wilmot holding the long towel all along\r\nthe altar.\r\n\r\n26th December, 1651. Came news of the death of that rebel, Ireton.\r\n\r\n31st December, 1651. Preached Dr. Wolley, after which was celebrated the\r\nHoly Communion, which I received also, preparative of my journey, being\r\nnow resolved to leave France altogether, and to return God Almighty\r\nthanks for His gracious protection of me this past year.\r\n\r\n2d January, 1651-52. News of my sister Glanville's death in childbed,\r\nwhich exceedingly affected me.\r\n\r\nI went to one Mark Antonio, an incomparable artist in enameling. He\r\nwrought by the lamp figures in boss, of a large size, even to the life,\r\nso that nothing could be better molded. He told us stories of a Genoese\r\njeweler, who had the great ARCANUM, and had made projection before him\r\nseveral times. He met him at Cyprus traveling into Egypt; in his return\r\nfrom whence, he died at sea, and the secret with him, that else he had\r\npromised to have left it to him; that all his effects were seized on, and\r\ndissipated by the Greeks in the vessel, to an immense value. He also\r\naffirmed, that being in a goldsmith's shop at Amsterdam, a person of very\r\nlow stature came in, and desired the goldsmith to melt him a pound of\r\nlead; which done, he unscrewed the pommel of his sword, and taking out of\r\na little box a small quantity of powder, casting it into the crucible,\r\npoured an ingot out, which when cold he took up, saying, \"Sir, you will\r\nbe paid for your lead in the crucible,\" and so went out immediately. When\r\nhe was gone the goldsmith found four ounces of good gold in it; but could\r\nnever set eye again on the little man, though he sought all the city for\r\nhim. Antonio asserted this with great obtestation; nor know I what to\r\nthink of it, there are so many impostors and people who love to tell\r\nstrange stories, as this artist did, who had been a great rover, and\r\nspoke ten different languages.\r\n\r\n13th January, 1652. I took leave of Mr. Waller, who, having been\r\nproscribed by the rebels, had obtained of them permission to return, was\r\ngoing to England.\r\n\r\n29th January, 1652. Abundance of my French and English friends and some\r\nGermans came to take leave of me, and I set out in a coach for Calais, in\r\nan exceedingly hard frost which had continued for some time. We got that\r\nnight to Beaumont; 30th, to Beauvais; 31st, we found the ways very deep\r\nwith snow, and it was exceedingly cold; dined at Pois; lay at Pernèe, a\r\nmiserable cottage of miserable people in a wood, wholly unfurnished, but\r\nin a little time we had sorry beds and some provision, which they told me\r\nthey hid in the wood for fear of the frontier enemy, the garrisons near\r\nthem continually plundering what they had. They were often infested with\r\nwolves. I cannot remember that I ever saw more miserable creatures.\r\n\r\n1st February, 1652. I dined at Abbeville; 2d, dined at Montreuil, lay at\r\nBoulogne; 3d, came to Calais, by eleven in the morning; I thought to have\r\nembarked in the evening, but, for fear of pirates plying near the coast,\r\nI dared not trust our small vessel, and stayed till Monday following,\r\nwhen two or three lusty vessels were to depart.\r\n\r\nI brought with me from Paris Mr. Christopher Wase, sometime before made\r\nto resign his Fellowship in King's College, Cambridge, because he would\r\nnot take the Covenant. He had been a soldier in Flanders, and came\r\nmiserable to Paris. From his excellent learning, and some relation he had\r\nto Sir R. Browne, I bore his charges into England, and clad and provided\r\nfor him, till he should find some better condition; and he was worthy of\r\nit. There came with us also Captain Griffith, Mr. Tyrell, brother to Sir\r\nTimothy Tyrell, of Shotover (near Oxford).\r\n\r\nAt Calais, I dined with my Lord Wentworth, and met with Mr. Heath, Sir\r\nRichard Lloyd, Captain Paine, and divers of our banished friends, of whom\r\nunderstanding that the Count de la Strade, Governor of Dunkirk, was in\r\nthe town, who had bought my wife's picture, taken by pirates at sea the\r\nyear before (my wife having sent it for me in England), as my Lord of\r\nNorwich had informed me at Paris, I made my address to him, who frankly\r\ntold me that he had such a picture in his own bedchamber among other\r\nladies, and how he came by it; seeming well pleased that it was his\r\nfortune to preserve it for me, and he generously promised to send it to\r\nany friend I had at Dover; I mentioned a French merchant there and so\r\ntook my leave.\r\n\r\n6th February, 1652. I embarked early in the packet boat, but put my goods\r\nin a stouter vessel. It was calm, so that we got not to Dover till eight\r\nat night. I took horse for Canterbury, and lay at Rochester; next day, to\r\nGravesend, took a pair of oars, and landed at Sayes Court, where I stayed\r\nthree days to refresh, and look after my packet and goods, sent by a\r\nstouter vessel. I went to visit my cousin, Richard Fanshawe, and divers\r\nother friends.\r\n\r\n6th March, 1652. Saw the magnificent funeral of that arch-rebel, Ireton,\r\ncarried in pomp from Somerset House to Westminster, accompanied with\r\ndivers regiments of soldiers, horse and foot; then marched the mourners,\r\nGeneral Cromwell (his father-in-law), his mock-parliament-men, officers,\r\nand forty poor men in gowns, three led horses in housings of black cloth,\r\ntwo led in black velvet, and his charging horse, all covered over with\r\nembroidery and gold, on crimson velvet; then the guidons, ensigns, four\r\nheralds, carrying the arms of the State (as they called it), namely, the\r\nred cross and Ireland, with the casque, wreath, sword, spurs, etc.; next,\r\na chariot canopied of black velvet, and six horses, in which was the\r\ncorpse; the pall held up by the mourners on foot; the mace and sword,\r\nwith other marks of his charge in Ireland (where he died of the plague),\r\ncarried before in black scarfs. Thus, in a grave pace, drums covered with\r\ncloth, soldiers reversing their arms, they proceeded through the streets\r\nin a very solemn manner. This Ireton was a stout rebel, and had been very\r\nbloody to the King's party, witness his severity at Colchester, when in\r\ncold blood he put to death those gallant gentlemen, Sir Charles Lucas and\r\nSir George Lisle. My cousin, R. Fanshawe, came to visit me, and informed\r\nme of many considerable affairs. Sir Henry Herbert presented me with his\r\nbrother, my Lord Cherbury's book, \"_De Veritate_.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEPTFORD]\r\n\r\n9th March, 1652. I went to Deptford, where I made preparation for my\r\nsettlement, no more intending to go out of England, but endeavor a\r\nsettled life, either in this or some other place, there being now so\r\nlittle appearance of any change for the better, all being entirely in\r\nthe rebels' hands; and this particular habitation and the estate\r\ncontiguous to it (belonging to my father-in-law, actually in his\r\nMajesty's service) very much suffering for want of some friend to rescue\r\nit out of the power of the usurpers, so as to preserve our interest, and\r\ntake some care of my other concerns, by the advice and endeavor of my\r\nfriends I was advised to reside in it, and compound with the soldiers.\r\nThis I was besides authorized by his Majesty to do, and encouraged with a\r\npromise that what was in lease from the Crown, if ever it pleased God to\r\nrestore him, he would secure to us in fee farm. I had also addresses and\r\ncyphers, to correspond with his Majesty and Ministers abroad: upon all\r\nwhich inducements, I was persuaded to settle henceforth in England,\r\nhaving now run about the world, most part out of my own country, near ten\r\nyears. I therefore now likewise meditated sending over for my wife, whom\r\nas yet I had left at Paris.\r\n\r\n14th March, 1652. I went to Lewisham, where I heard an honest sermon on\r\n1 Cor. ii. 5-7, being the first Sunday I had been at church since my\r\nreturn, it being now a rare thing to find a priest of the Church of\r\nEngland in a parish pulpit, most of which were filled with Independents\r\nand Fanatics.\r\n\r\n15th March, 1652. I saw the \"Diamond\" and \"Ruby\" launched in the Dock at\r\nDeptford, carrying forty-eight brass cannon each; Cromwell and his\r\ngrandees present, with great acclamations.\r\n\r\n18th March, 1652. That worthy divine, Mr. Owen, of Eltham, a sequestered\r\nperson, came to visit me.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n19th March, 1652. Invited by Lady Gerrard, I went to London, where we had\r\na great supper; all the vessels, which were innumerable, were of\r\nporcelain, she having the most ample and richest collection of that\r\ncuriosity in England.\r\n\r\n22d March, 1652. I went with my brother Evelyn to Wotton, to give him\r\nwhat directions I was able about his garden, which he was now desirous to\r\nput into some form; but for which he was to remove a mountain overgrown\r\nwith huge trees and thicket, with a moat within ten yards of the house.\r\nThis my brother immediately attempted, and that without great cost, for\r\nmore than a hundred yards south, by digging down the mountain, and\r\nflinging it into a rapid stream; it not only carried away the sand, etc.,\r\nbut filled up the moat, and leveled that noble area, where now the garden\r\nand fountain is. The first occasion of my brother making this alteration\r\nwas my building the little retiring place between the great wood eastward\r\nnext the meadow, where, some time after my father's death, I made a\r\ntriangular pond, or little stew, with an artificial rock after my coming\r\nout of Flanders.\r\n\r\n29th March, 1652. I heard that excellent prelate, the primate of Ireland\r\n(Jacobus Usher) preach in Lincoln's Inn, on Heb. iv. 16, encouraging of\r\npenitent sinners.\r\n\r\n5th April, 1652. My brother George brought to Sayes Court Cromwell's Act\r\nof Oblivion to all that would submit to the Government.\r\n\r\n13th April, 1652. News was brought me that Lady Cotton, my brother\r\nGeorge's wife was delivered of a son.\r\n\r\nI was moved by a letter out of France to publish the letter which some\r\ntime since I sent to Dean Cosin's proselyted son; but I did not conceive\r\nit convenient, for fear of displeasing her Majesty, the Queen.\r\n\r\n15th April, 1652. I wrote to the Dean, touching my buying his library,\r\nwhich was one of the choicest collections of any private person in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe Count de Strade most generously and handsomely sent me the picture of\r\nmy wife from Dunkirk, in a large tin case without any charge. It is of\r\nMr. Bourdon, and is that which has the dog in it, and is to the knees,\r\nbut it has been somewhat spoiled by washing it ignorantly with soapsuds.\r\n\r\n25th April, 1652. I went to visit Alderman Kendrick, a fanatic Lord\r\nMayor, who had married a relation of ours, where I met with a Captain who\r\nhad been thirteen times to the East Indies.\r\n\r\n29th April, 1652. Was that celebrated eclipse of the sun, so much\r\nthreatened by the astrologers, and which had so exceedingly alarmed the\r\nwhole nation that hardly any one would work, nor stir out of their\r\nhouses. So ridiculously were they abused by knavish and ignorant\r\nstar-gazers.\r\n\r\nWe went this afternoon to see the Queen's house at Greenwich, now given\r\nby the rebels to Bulstrode Whitelocke, one of their unhappy counselors,\r\nand keeper of pretended liberties.\r\n\r\n10th May, 1652. Passing by Smithfield, I saw a miserable creature\r\nburning, who had murdered her husband. I went to see some workmanship of\r\nthat admirable artist, Reeves, famous for perspective, and turning\r\ncuriosities in ivory.\r\n\r\n29th May, 1652. I went to give order about a coach to be made against my\r\nwife's coming, being my first coach, the pattern whereof I brought out of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n30th May, 1652. I went to obtain of my Lord Devonshire that my nephew,\r\nGeorge, might be brought up with my young Lord, his son, to whom I was\r\nrecommending Mr. Wase. I also inspected the manner of camleting silk and\r\ngrograms at one Monsieur La Dorées in Moor-fields, and thence to Colonel\r\nMorley, one of their Council of State, as then called, who had been my\r\nschoolfellow, to request a pass for my wife's safe landing, and the goods\r\nshe was to bring with her out of France; which he courteously granted,\r\nand did me many other kindnesses, that was a great matter in those days.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, at Charlton church, where I heard a Rabinical sermon.\r\nHere is a fair monument in black marble of Sir Adam Newton, who built\r\nthat fair house near it for Prince Henry, and where my noble friend, Sir\r\nHenry Newton, succeeded him.\r\n\r\n3d June, 1652. I received a letter from Colonel Morley to the Magistrates\r\nand Searchers at Rye, to assist my wife at her landing, and show her all\r\ncivility.\r\n\r\n4th June, 1652. I set out to meet her now on her journey from Paris,\r\nafter she had obtained leave to come out of that city, which had now been\r\nbesieged some time by the Prince of Condé's army in the time of the\r\nrebellion, and after she had been now near twelve years from her own\r\ncountry, that is, since five years of age, at which time she went over. I\r\nwent to Rye to meet her, where was an embargo on occasion of the late\r\nconflict with the Holland fleet, the two nations being now in war, and\r\nwhich made sailing very unsafe.\r\n\r\nOn Whit Sunday, I went to the church (which is a very fair one), and\r\nheard one of the canters, who dismissed the assembly rudely, and without\r\nany blessing. Here I stayed till the 10th with no small impatience, when\r\nI walked over to survey the ruins of Winchelsea, that ancient cinq-port,\r\nwhich by the remains and ruins of ancient streets and public structures,\r\ndiscovers it to have been formerly a considerable and large city. There\r\nare to be seen vast caves and vaults, walls and towers, ruins of\r\nmonasteries and of a sumptuous church, in which are some handsome\r\nmonuments, especially of the Templars, buried just in the manner of those\r\nin the Temple at London. This place being now all in rubbish, and a few\r\ndespicable hovels and cottages only standing, hath yet a Mayor. The sea,\r\nwhich formerly rendered it a rich and commodious port, has now forsaken\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TUNBRIDGE]\r\n\r\n11th June, 1652. About four in the afternoon, being at bowls on the\r\ngreen, we discovered a vessel which proved to be that in which my wife\r\nwas, and which got into the harbor about eight that evening, to my no\r\nsmall joy. They had been three days at sea, and escaped the Dutch fleet,\r\nthrough which they passed, taken for fishers, which was great good\r\nfortune, there being seventeen bales of furniture and other rich plunder,\r\nwhich I bless God came all safe to land, together with my wife, and my\r\nLady Browne, her mother, who accompanied her. My wife being discomposed\r\nby having been so long at sea, we set not forth toward home till the\r\n14th, when, hearing the smallpox was very rife in and about London, and\r\nLady Browne having a desire to drink Tunbridge waters, I carried them\r\nthither, and stayed in a very sweet place, private and refreshing, and\r\ntook the waters myself till the 23d, when I went to prepare for their\r\nreception, leaving them for the present in their little cottage by the\r\nWells.\r\n\r\nThe weather being hot, and having sent my man on before, I rode\r\nnegligently under favor of the shade, till, within three miles of\r\nBromley, at a place called the Procession Oak, two cutthroats started\r\nout, and striking with long staves at the horse, and taking hold of the\r\nreins, threw me down, took my sword, and hauled me into a deep thicket,\r\nsome quarter of a mile from the highway, where they might securely rob\r\nme, as they soon did. What they got of money, was not considerable, but\r\nthey took two rings, the one an emerald with diamonds, the other an onyx,\r\nand a pair of buckles set with rubies and diamonds, which were of value,\r\nand after all bound my hands behind me, and my feet, having before\r\npulled off my boots; they then set me up against an oak, with most bloody\r\nthreats to cut my throat if I offered to cry out, or make any noise; for\r\nthey should be within hearing, I not being the person they looked for. I\r\ntold them that if they had not basely surprised me they should not have\r\nhad so easy a prize, and that it would teach me never to ride near a\r\nhedge, since, had I been in the midway, they dared not have adventured on\r\nme; at which they cocked their pistols, and told me they had long guns,\r\ntoo, and were fourteen companions. I begged for my onyx, and told them it\r\nbeing engraved with my arms would betray them; but nothing prevailed. My\r\nhorse's bridle they slipped, and searched the saddle, which they pulled\r\noff, but let the horse graze, and then turning again bridled him and tied\r\nhim to a tree, yet so as he might graze, and thus left me bound. My horse\r\nwas perhaps not taken, because he was marked and cropped on both ears,\r\nand well known on that road. Left in this manner, grievously was I\r\ntormented with flies, ants, and the sun, nor was my anxiety little how I\r\nshould get loose in that solitary place, where I could neither hear nor\r\nsee any creature but my poor horse and a few sheep straggling in the\r\ncopse.\r\n\r\nAfter near two hours attempting, I got my hands to turn palm to palm,\r\nhaving been tied back to back, and then it was long before I could slip\r\nthe cord over my wrists to my thumb, which at last I did, and then soon\r\nunbound my feet, and saddling my horse and roaming a while about, I at\r\nlast perceived dust to rise, and soon after heard the rattling of a cart,\r\ntoward which I made, and, by the help of two countrymen, I got back into\r\nthe highway. I rode to Colonel Blount's, a great justiciary of the times,\r\nwho sent out hue and cry immediately. The next morning, sore as my wrists\r\nand arms were, I went to London, and got 500 tickets printed and\r\ndispersed by an officer of Goldsmiths' Hall, and within two days had\r\ntidings of all I had lost, except my sword, which had a silver hilt, and\r\nsome trifles. The rogues had pawned one of my rings for a trifle to a\r\ngoldsmith's servant, before the tickets came to the shop, by which means\r\nthey escaped; the other ring was bought by a victualer, who brought it\r\nto a goldsmith, but he having seen the ticket seized the man. I afterward\r\ndischarged him on his protestation of innocence. Thus did God deliver me\r\nfrom these villains, and not only so, but restored what they took, as\r\ntwice before he had graciously done, both at sea and land, I mean when I\r\nhad been robbed by pirates, and was in danger of a considerable loss at\r\nAmsterdam; for which, and many, many signal preservations, I am extremely\r\nobliged to give thanks to God my Savior.\r\n\r\n25th June, 1652. After a drought of near four months, there fell so\r\nviolent a tempest of hail, rain, wind, thunder, and lightning, as no man\r\nhad seen the like in his age; the hail being in some places four or five\r\ninches about, broke all glass about London, especially at Deptford, and\r\nmore at Greenwich.\r\n\r\n29th June, 1652. I returned to Tunbridge, and again drank the water, till\r\n10th of July.\r\n\r\nWe went to see the house of my Lord Clanrickarde at Summer hill, near\r\nTunbridge (now given to that villain, Bradshawe, who condemned the King).\r\n'Tis situated on an eminent hill, with a park; but has nothing else\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\n4th July, 1652. I heard a sermon at Mr. Packer's chapel at Groomsbridge,\r\na pretty melancholy seat, well wooded and watered. In this house was one\r\nof the French kings[45] kept prisoner. The chapel was built by Mr.\r\nPacker's father, in remembrance of King Charles the First's safe return\r\nout of Spain.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 45: The Duke of Orleans, taken at the battle of Agincourt,\r\n    4 Hen. V., by Richard Waller, then owner of this place. See Hasted's\r\n    \"Kent,\" vol. i., p. 431.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PENSHURST]\r\n\r\n9th July, 1652. We went to see Penshurst, the Earl of Leicester's, famous\r\nonce for its gardens and excellent fruit, and for the noble conversation\r\nwhich was wont to meet there, celebrated by that illustrious person, Sir\r\nPhilip Sidney, who there composed divers of his pieces. It stands in a\r\npark, is finely watered, and was now full of company, on the marriage of\r\nmy old fellow-collegiate, Mr. Robert Smith, who married my Lady Dorothy\r\nSidney, widow of the Earl of Sunderland.\r\n\r\nOne of the men who robbed me was taken; I was accordingly summoned to\r\nappear against him; and, on the 12th, was in Westminster Hall, but not\r\nbeing bound over, nor willing to hang the fellow, I did not appear,\r\ncoming only to save a friend's bail; but the bill being found, he was\r\nturned over to the Old Bailey. In the meantime, I received a petition\r\nfrom the prisoner, whose father I understood was an honest old farmer in\r\nKent. He was charged, with other crimes, and condemned, but reprieved. I\r\nheard afterward that, had it not been for his companion, a younger man,\r\nhe would probably have killed me. He was afterward charged with some\r\nother crime, but, refusing to plead, was pressed to death.\r\n\r\n23d July, 1652. Came my old friend, Mr. Spencer, to visit me.\r\n\r\n30th July, 1652. I took advice about purchasing Sir Richard's [Browne]\r\ninterest of those who had bought Sayes Court.\r\n\r\n1st August, 1652. Came old Jerome Lennier, of Greenwich, a man skilled in\r\npainting and music, and another rare musician, called Mell. I went to see\r\nhis collection of pictures, especially those of Julio Romano, which\r\nsurely had been the King's, and an Egyptian figure, etc. There were also\r\nexcellent things of Polydore, Guido, Raphael, and Tintoretto. Lennier had\r\nbeen a domestic of Queen Elizabeth, and showed me her head, an intaglio\r\nin a rare sardonyx, cut by a famous Italian, which he assured me was\r\nexceedingly like her.\r\n\r\n24th August, 1652. My first child, a son, was born precisely at one\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\n2d September, 1652. Mr. Owen, the sequestered divine, of Eltham,\r\nchristened my son by the name of Richard.\r\n\r\n22d September, 1652. I went to Woodcott, where Lady Browne was taken with\r\nscarlet fever, and died. She was carried to Deptford, and interred in the\r\nchurch near Sir Richard's relations with all decent ceremonies, and\r\naccording to the church-office, for which I obtained permission, after it\r\nhad not been used in that church for seven years. Thus ended an excellent\r\nand virtuous lady, universally lamented, having been so obliging on all\r\noccasions to those who continually frequented her house in Paris, which\r\nwas not only an hospital, but an asylum to all our persecuted and\r\nafflicted countrymen, during eleven years' residence there in that\r\nhonorable situation.\r\n\r\n25th September, 1652. I went to see Dr. Mason's house, so famous for the\r\nprospect (for the house is a wretched one) and description of Barclay's\r\n\"_Icon Animarum_.\"[46]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 46: The book here referred to is in the British Museum,\r\n    entitled \"_Joannis Barclaii Icon Animarum_,\" and printed at London,\r\n    1614, small 12mo. It is written in Latin, and dedicated to Louis\r\n    XIII. of France, for what reason does not appear, the author\r\n    speaking of himself as a subject of this country. It mentions the\r\n    necessity of forming the minds of youth, as a skillful gardener\r\n    forms his trees; the different dispositions of men, in different\r\n    nations; English, Scotch, and Irish, etc. Chapter second contains a\r\n    florid description of the beautiful scenery about Greenwich, but\r\n    does not mention Dr. Mason, or his house.]\r\n\r\n5th November, 1652. To London, to visit some friends, but the insolences\r\nwere so great in the streets that I could not return till the next day.\r\n\r\nDr. Scarborough was instant with me to give the Tables of Veins and\r\nArteries to the College of Physicians, pretending he would not only read\r\nupon them, but celebrate my curiosity as being the first who caused them\r\nto be completed in that manner, and with that cost; but I was not so\r\nwilling yet to part with them, as to lend them to the College during\r\ntheir anatomical lectures; which I did accordingly.\r\n\r\n22d November, 1652. I went to London, where was proposed to me the\r\npromoting that great work (since accomplished by Dr. Walton, Bishop of\r\nChester), \"_Biblia Polyglotta_,\" by Mr. Pierson, that most learned\r\ndivine.\r\n\r\n25th December, 1652. Christmas day, no sermon anywhere, no church being\r\npermitted to be open, so observed it at home. The next day, we went to\r\nLewisham, where an honest divine preached.\r\n\r\n31st December, 1652. I adjusted all accompts, and rendered thanks to\r\nAlmighty God for his mercies to me the year past.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SAYES COURT]\r\n\r\n1st January, 1652-53. I set apart in preparation for the Blessed\r\nSacrament, which the next day Mr. Owen administered to me and all my\r\nfamily in Sayes Court, preaching on John vi. 32, 33, showing the\r\nexceeding benefits of our blessed Savior taking our nature upon him. He\r\nhad christened my son and churched my wife in our own house as before\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\n17th January, 1653. I began to set out the oval garden at Sayes Court,\r\nwhich was before a rude orchard, and all the rest one entire field of\r\n100 acres, without any hedge, except the hither holly hedge joining to\r\nthe bank of the mount walk. This was the beginning of all the succeeding\r\ngardens, walks, groves, inclosures, and plantations there.\r\n\r\n21st January, 1653. I went to London, and sealed some of the writings of\r\nmy purchase of Sayes Court.\r\n\r\n30th January, 1653. At our own parish church, a stranger preached. There\r\nwas now and then an honest orthodox man got into the pulpit, and, though\r\nthe present incumbent was somewhat of the Independent, yet he ordinarily\r\npreached sound doctrine, and was a peaceable man; which was an\r\nextraordinary felicity in this age.\r\n\r\n1st February, 1653. Old Alexander Rosse (author of \"_Virgilius\r\nEvangelizans_,\" and many other little books) presented me with his book\r\nagainst Mr. Hobbes's \"Leviathan.\"\r\n\r\n19th February, 1653. I planted the orchard at Sayes Court; new moon, wind\r\nwest.\r\n\r\n22d February, 1653. Was perfected the sealing, livery, and seisin of my\r\npurchase of Sayes Court. My brother, George Glanville, Mr. Scudamore, Mr.\r\nOffley, Co. William Glanville (son to Sergeant Glanville, sometime\r\nSpeaker of the House of Commons), Co. Stephens, and several of my friends\r\ndining with me. I had bargained for £3,200, but I paid £3,500.\r\n\r\n25th March, 1653. Came to see me that rare graver in _taille-douce_,\r\nMonsieur Richett, he was sent by Cardinal Mazarine to make a collection\r\nof pictures.\r\n\r\n11th April, 1653. I went to take the air in Hyde Park, where every coach\r\nwas made to pay a shilling, and horse sixpence, by the sordid fellow who\r\nhad purchased it of the state, as they called it.\r\n\r\n17th May, 1653. My servant Hoare, who wrote those exquisite several\r\nhands, fell of a fit of an apoplexy, caused, as I suppose, by tampering\r\nwith mercury about an experiment in gold.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n29th May, 1653. I went to London, to take my last leave of my honest\r\nfriend, Mr. Barton, now dying; it was a great loss to me and to my\r\naffairs. On the sixth of June, I attended his funeral.\r\n\r\n8th June, 1653. Came my brother George, Captain Evelyn, the great\r\ntraveler, Mr. Muschamp, my cousin, Thomas Keightly, and a virtuoso,\r\nfastastical Simons, who had the talent of embossing so to the life.\r\n\r\n9th June, 1653. I went to visit my worthy neighbor, Sir Henry Newton [at\r\nCharlton], and consider the prospect, which is doubtless for city, river,\r\nships, meadows, hill, woods, and all other amenities, one of the most\r\nnoble in the world; so as, had the house running water, it were a\r\nprincely seat. Mr. Henshaw and his brother-in-law came to visit me, and\r\nhe presented me with a seleniscope.\r\n\r\n19th June, 1653. This day, I paid all my debts to a farthing; oh, blessed\r\nday!\r\n\r\n21st June, 1653. My Lady Gerrard, and one Esquire Knight, a very rich\r\ngentleman, living in Northamptonshire, visited me.\r\n\r\n23d June, 1653. Mr. Lombart, a famous graver, came to see my collections.\r\n\r\n27th June, 1653. Monsieur Roupel sent me a small phial of his _aurum\r\npotabile_, with a letter, showing the way of administering it, and the\r\nstupendous cures it had done at Paris; but, ere it came to me, by what\r\naccident I know not, it was all run out.\r\n\r\n17th August, 1653. I went to visit Mr. Hyldiard, at his house at Horsley\r\n(formerly the great Sir Walter Raleigh's[47]), where met me Mr. Oughtred,\r\nthe famous mathematician; he showed me a box, or golden case, of divers\r\nrich and aromatic balsams, which a chemist, a scholar of his, had sent\r\nhim out of Germany.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 47: Evelyn is here in error: Mr. Hyldiard was of East\r\n    Horsley, Sir Walter of West.]\r\n\r\n21st August, 1653. I heard that good old man, Mr. Higham, the parson of\r\nthe parish of Wotton where I was born, and who had baptized me, preach\r\nafter his very plain way on Luke, comparing this troublesome world to the\r\nsea, the ministers to the fishermen, and the saints to the fish.\r\n\r\n22d August, 1653. We all went to Guildford, to rejoice at the famous inn,\r\nthe Red Lion, and to see the hospital, and the monument of Archbishop\r\nAbbot, the founder, who lies buried in the chapel of his endowment.\r\n\r\n28th September, 1653. At Greenwich preached that holy martyr, Dr. Hewer,\r\non Psalm xc. 11, magnifying the grace of God to penitents, and\r\nthreatening the extinction of his Gospel light for the prodigious\r\nimpiety of the age.\r\n\r\n11th October, 1653. My son, John Stansfield, was born, being my second\r\nchild, and christened by the name of my mother's father, that name now\r\nquite extinct, being of Cheshire. Christened by Mr. Owen, in my library,\r\nat Sayes Court, where he afterward churched my wife, I always making use\r\nof him on these occasions, because the parish minister dared not have\r\nofficiated according to the form and usage of the Church of England, to\r\nwhich I always adhered.\r\n\r\n25th October, 1653. Mr. Owen preached in my library at Sayes Court on\r\nLuke xviii. 7, 8, an excellent discourse on the unjust judge, showing why\r\nAlmighty God would sometimes be compared by such similitudes. He\r\nafterward administered to us all the Holy Sacrament.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n28th October, 1653. Went to London, to visit my Lady Gerrard, where I saw\r\nthat cursed woman called the Lady Norton, of whom it was reported that\r\nshe spit in our King's face as he went to the scaffold. Indeed, her talk\r\nand discourse was like an impudent woman.\r\n\r\n21st November, 1653. I went to London, to speak with Sir John Evelyn, my\r\nkinsman, about the purchase of an estate of Mr. Lambard's at Westeram,\r\nwhich afterward Sir John himself bought for his son-in-law, Leech.\r\n\r\n4th December, 1653. Going this day to our church, I was surprised to see\r\na tradesman, a mechanic, step up; I was resolved yet to stay and see what\r\nhe would make of it. His text was from 2 Sam. xxiii. 20: \"And Benaiah\r\nwent down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in the time of\r\nsnow\"; the purport was, that no danger was to be thought difficult when\r\nGod called for shedding of blood, inferring that now the saints were\r\ncalled to destroy temporal governments; with such feculent stuff; so\r\ndangerous a crisis were things grown to.\r\n\r\n25th December, 1653. Christmas day. No churches, or public assembly. I\r\nwas fain to pass the devotions of that Blessed day with my family at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n20th January, 1653-54. Come to see my old acquaintance and the most\r\nincomparable player on the Irish harp, Mr. Clark,[48] after his travels.\r\nHe was an excellent musician, a discreet gentleman, born in Devonshire\r\n(as I remember). Such music before or since did I never hear, that\r\ninstrument being neglected for its extraordinary difficulty; but, in my\r\njudgment, far superior to the lute itself, or whatever speaks with\r\nstrings.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 48: See under the year 1688, November.]\r\n\r\n25th January, 1654. Died my son, J. Stansfield, of convulsion fits;\r\nburied at Deptford on the east corner of the church, near his mother's\r\ngreat-grandfather, and other relatives.\r\n\r\n8th February, 1654. Ash Wednesday. In contradiction to all custom and\r\ndecency, the usurper, Cromwell, feasted at the Lord Mayor's, riding in\r\ntriumph through the city.\r\n\r\n14th February, 1654. I saw a tame lion play familiarly with a lamb; he\r\nwas a huge beast, and I thrust my hand into his mouth and found his\r\ntongue rough like a cat's; a sheep also with six legs, which made use of\r\nfive of them to walk; a goose that had four legs, two crops, and as many\r\nvents.\r\n\r\n29th March, 1654. That excellent man, Mr. Owen, preached in my library on\r\nMatt. xxviii. 6, a resurrection sermon, and after it we all received the\r\nHoly Communion.\r\n\r\n6th April, 1654. Came my Lord Herbert, Sir Kenelm Digby, Mr. Denham, and\r\nother friends to see me.\r\n\r\n15th April, 1654. I went to London to hear the famous Jeremy Taylor\r\n(since Bishop of Down and Connor) at St. Gregory's (near St. Paul's) on\r\nMatt. vi, 48, concerning evangelical perfection.\r\n\r\n5th May, 1654. I bound my lackey, Thomas Headly, apprentice to a\r\ncarpenter, giving with him five pounds and new clothing; he thrived very\r\nwell, and became rich.\r\n\r\n8th May, 1654. I went to Hackney, to see Lady Brook's garden, which was\r\none of the neatest and most celebrated in England, the house well\r\nfurnished, but a despicable building. Returning, visited one Mr. Tomb's\r\ngarden; it has large and noble walks, some modern statues, a vineyard,\r\nplanted in strawberry borders, staked at ten feet distances, the\r\nbanqueting-house of cedar, where the couch and seats were carved _à\r\nl'antique_; some good pictures in the house, especially one of Vandyke's,\r\nbeing a man in his shirt; also some of Stenwyck. I also called at Mr.\r\nDucie's, who has indeed a rare collection of the best masters, and one of\r\nthe largest stories of H. Holbein. I also saw Sir Thomas Fowler's\r\naviary, which is a poor business.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _OLIVER CROMWELL DICTATING TO JOHN MILTON_\r\n\r\n_The letter to the Duke of Savoy to stop the persecution of the\r\nProtestants of Piedmont, 1655. Photogravure from an engraving by Sartain\r\nafter Newenham_]\r\n\r\n10th May, 1654. My Lady Gerrard treated us at Mulberry Garden, now the\r\nonly place of refreshment about the town for persons of the best quality\r\nto be exceedingly cheated at; Cromwell and his partisans having shut up\r\nand seized on Spring Garden, which, till now, had been the usual\r\nrendezvous for the ladies and gallants at this season.\r\n\r\n11th May, 1654. I now observed how the women began to paint themselves,\r\nformerly a most ignominious thing, and used only by prostitutes.\r\n\r\n14th May, 1654. There being no such thing as church anniversaries in the\r\nparochial assemblies, I was forced to provide at home for Whit Sunday.\r\n\r\n15th May, 1654. Came Sir Robert Stapylton, the translator of \"Juvenal,\"\r\nto visit me.\r\n\r\n8th June, 1654. My wife and I set out in a coach and four horses, in our\r\nway to visit relations of hers in Wiltshire, and other parts, where we\r\nresolved to spend some months. We dined at Windsor, saw the Castle and\r\nChapel of St. George, where they have laid our blessed Martyr, King\r\nCharles, in the VAULT JUST BEFORE THE ALTAR. The church and workmanship\r\nin stone is admirable. The Castle itself is large in circumference; but\r\nthe rooms melancholy, and of ancient magnificence. The keep, or mount,\r\nhath, besides its incomparable prospect, a very profound well; and the\r\nterrace toward Eton, with the park, meandering Thames, and sweet meadows,\r\nyield one of the most delightful prospects. That night, we lay at\r\nReading. Saw my Lord Craven's house at Causam [Caversham], now in ruins,\r\nhis goodly woods felling by the Rebels.\r\n\r\n9th June, 1654. Dined at Marlborough, which having been lately fired, was\r\nnow new built. At one end of this town, we saw my Lord Seymour's house,\r\nbut nothing observable save the Mount, to which we ascended by windings\r\nfor near half a mile. It seems to have been cast up by hand. We passed by\r\nColonel Popham's, a noble seat, park, and river. Thence, to Newbury, a\r\nconsiderable town, and Donnington, famous for its battle, siege, and\r\ncastle, this last had been in the possession of old Geoffrey Chaucer.\r\nThen to Aldermaston, a house of Sir Humphrey Forster's, built _à la\r\nmoderne_. Also, that exceedingly beautiful seat of my Lord Pembroke, on\r\nthe ascent of hill, flanked with wood, and regarding the river, and so,\r\nat night, to Cadenham, the mansion of Edward Hungerford, Esq., uncle to\r\nmy wife, where we made some stay. The rest of the week we did nothing but\r\nfeast and make good cheer, to welcome my wife.\r\n\r\n27th June, 1654. We all went to see Bath, where I bathed in the cross\r\nbath. Among the rest of the idle diversions of the town, one musician was\r\nfamous for acting a changeling, which indeed he personated strangely.\r\n\r\nThe _facciáta_ of this cathedral is remarkable for its historical\r\ncarving. The King's Bath is esteemed the fairest in Europe. The town is\r\nentirely built of stone, but the streets narrow, uneven and unpleasant.\r\nHere, we trifled and bathed, and intervisited with the company who\r\nfrequent the place for health, till the 30th, and then went to Bristol, a\r\ncity emulating London, not for its large extent, but manner of building,\r\nshops, bridge, traffic, exchange, market-place, etc. The governor showed\r\nus the castle, of no great concernment. The city wholly mercantile, as\r\nstanding near the famous Severn, commodiously for Ireland, and the\r\nWestern world. Here I first saw the manner of refining sugar and casting\r\nit into loaves, where we had a collection of eggs fried in the sugar\r\nfurnace, together with excellent Spanish wine. But, what appeared most\r\nstupendous to me, was the rock of St. Vincent, a little distance from the\r\ntown, the precipice whereof is equal to anything of that nature I have\r\nseen in the most confragose cataracts of the Alps, the river gliding\r\nbetween them at an extraordinary depth. Here, we went searching for\r\ndiamonds, and to the Hot Wells, at its foot. There is also on the side of\r\nthis horrid Alp a very romantic seat: and so we returned to Bath in the\r\nevening, and July 1st to Cadenham.\r\n\r\n4th July, 1654. On a letter from my wife's uncle, Mr. Pretyman, I waited\r\nback on her to London, passing by Hungerford, a town famous for its\r\ntrouts, and the next day arrived at Deptford, which was 60 miles, in the\r\nextremity of heat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OXFORD]\r\n\r\n6th July, 1654. I went early to London, and the following day met my wife\r\nand company at Oxford, the eve of the Act.\r\n\r\n8th July, 1654. Was spent in hearing several exercises in the schools;\r\nand, after dinner, the Proctor opened the Act at St. Mary's (according to\r\ncustom), and the Prevaricators, their drollery. Then, the Doctors\r\ndisputed. We supped at Wadham College.\r\n\r\n9th July, 1654. Dr. French preached at St. Mary's, on Matt. xii. 42,\r\nadvising the students the search after true wisdom, not to be had in the\r\nbooks of philosophers, but in the Scriptures alone. In the afternoon, the\r\nfamous Independent, Dr. Owen, perstringing Episcopacy. He was now\r\nCromwell's Vice-Chancellor. We dined with Dr. Ward, Mathematical\r\nProfessor (since Bishop of Sarum), and at night supped in Baliol College\r\nHall, where I had once been student and fellow-commoner, and where they\r\nmade me extraordinarily welcome.\r\n\r\n10th July, 1654. On Monday, I went again to the schools, to hear the\r\nseveral faculties, and in the afternoon tarried out the whole Act in St.\r\nMary's, the long speeches of the Proctors, the Vice-Chancellor, the\r\nseveral Professors, creation of Doctors, by the cap, ring, kiss, etc.,\r\nthose ancient ceremonies and institution being as yet not wholly\r\nabolished. Dr. Kendal, now Inceptor among others, performing his Act\r\nincomparably well, concluded it with an excellent oration, abating his\r\nPresbyterian animosities, which he withheld, not even against that\r\nlearned and pious divine, Dr. Hammond. The Act was closed with the speech\r\nof the Vice-Chancellor, there being but four in theology, and three in\r\nmedicine, which was thought a considerable matter, the times considered.\r\nI dined at one Monsieur Fiat's, a student of Exeter College, and supped\r\nat a magnificent entertainment of Wadham Hall, invited by my dear and\r\nexcellent friend, Dr. Wilkins, then Warden (after, Bishop of Chester).\r\n\r\n11th July, 1654. Was the Latin sermon, which I could not be at, though\r\ninvited, being taken up at All Souls, where we had music, voices, and\r\ntheorbos, performed by some ingenious scholars. After dinner, I visited\r\nthat miracle of a youth, Mr. Christopher Wren, nephew to the Bishop of\r\nEly. Then Mr. Barlow (since Bishop of Lincoln), bibliothecarius of the\r\nBodleian Library, my most learned friend. He showed us the rarities of\r\nthat most famous place, manuscripts, medals, and other curiosities. Among\r\nthe MSS. an old English Bible, wherein the Eunuch mentioned to be\r\nbaptized by Philip, is called the Gelding: \"and Philip and the Gelding\r\nwent down into the water,\" etc. The original Acts of the Council of Basil\r\n900 years since, with the _bulla_, or leaden affix, which has a silken\r\ncord passing through every parchment; a MS. of Venerable Bede of 800\r\nyears antiquity; the old Ritual _secundum usum Sarum_ exceeding\r\nvoluminous; then, among the nicer curiosities, the \"Proverbs of Solomon,\"\r\nwritten in French by a lady, every chapter of a several character, or\r\nhand, the most exquisite imaginable; an hieroglyphical table, or carta,\r\nfolded up like a map, I suppose it painted on asses' hide, extremely\r\nrare; but, what is most illustrious, there were no less than 1,000 MSS.\r\nin nineteen languages, especially Oriental, furnishing that new part of\r\nthe library built by Archbishop Laud, from a design of Sir Kenelm Digby\r\nand the Earl of Pembroke. In the closet of the tower, they show some\r\nIndian weapons, urns, lamps, etc., but the rarest is the whole Alcoran,\r\nwritten on one large sheet of calico, made up in a priest's vesture, or\r\ncope, after the Turkish and Arabic character, so exquisitely written, as\r\nno printed letter comes near it; also, a roll of magical charms, divers\r\ntalismans, and some medals.\r\n\r\nThen, I led my wife into the Convocation House, finely wainscoted; the\r\nDivinity School, and Gothic carved roof; the Physic, or Anatomy School,\r\nadorned with some rarities of natural things; but nothing extraordinary\r\nsave the skin of a jackal, a rarely-colored jackatoo, or prodigious large\r\nparrot, two humming birds, not much bigger than our bumblebee, which\r\nindeed I had not seen before, that I remember.\r\n\r\n12th July, 1654. We went to St. John's, saw the library and the two\r\nskeletons, which are finely cleansed and put together; observable is here\r\nalso the store of mathematical instruments, chiefly given by the late\r\nArchbishop Laud, who built here a handsome quadrangle.\r\n\r\nThence we went to New College, where the chapel was in its ancient garb,\r\nnotwithstanding the scrupulosity of the times. Thence, to Christ's\r\nChurch, in whose library was shown us an Office of Henry VIII., the\r\nwriting, miniatures, and gilding whereof is equal, if not surpassing, any\r\ncuriosity I had seen of that kind; it was given by their founder,\r\nCardinal Wolsey. The glass windows of the cathedral (famous in my time)\r\nI found much abused. The ample hall and column, that spreads its capital\r\nto sustain the roof as one goes up the stairs, is very remarkable.\r\n\r\nNext we walked to Magdalen College, where we saw the library and chapel,\r\nwhich was likewise in pontifical order, the altar only I think turned\r\ntablewise, and there was still the double organ, which abominations (as\r\nnow esteemed) were almost universally demolished; Mr. Gibbon, that famous\r\nmusician, giving us a taste of his skill and talents on that instrument.\r\n\r\nHence, to the Physic Garden, where the sensitive plant was shown us for a\r\ngreat wonder. There grew canes, olive trees, rhubarb, but no\r\nextraordinary curiosities, besides very good fruit, which, when the\r\nladies had tasted, we returned in our coach to our lodgings.\r\n\r\n13th July, 1654. We all dined at that most obliging and\r\nuniversally-curious Dr. Wilkins's, at Wadham College. He was the first\r\nwho showed me the transparent apiaries, which he had built like castles\r\nand palaces, and so ordered them one upon another, as to take the honey\r\nwithout destroying the bees. These were adorned with a variety of dials,\r\nlittle statues, vanes, etc.; and, he was so abundantly civil, finding me\r\npleased with them, to present me with one of the hives which he had\r\nempty, and which I afterward had in my garden at Sayes Court, where it\r\ncontinued many years, and which his Majesty came on purpose to see and\r\ncontemplate with much satisfaction. He had also contrived a hollow\r\nstatue, which gave a voice and uttered words by a long, concealed pipe\r\nthat went to its mouth,[49] while one speaks through it at a good\r\ndistance. He had, above in his lodgings and gallery, variety of shadows,\r\ndials, perspectives, and many other artificial, mathematical, and magical\r\ncuriosities, a waywiser, a thermometer, a monstrous magnet, conic, and\r\nother sections, a balance on a demi-circle; most of them of his own, and\r\nthat prodigious young scholar Mr. Christopher Wren, who presented me with\r\na piece of white marble, which he had stained with a lively red, very\r\ndeep, as beautiful as if it had been natural.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 49: Such were the speaking figures long ago exhibited in\r\n    Spring Gardens, and in Leicester Fields.]\r\n\r\nThus satisfied with the civilities of Oxford, we left it, dining at\r\nFarringdon, a town which had been newly fired during the wars; and,\r\npassing near the seat of Sir Walter Pye, we came to Cadenham.\r\n\r\n16th July, 1654. We went to another uncle and relative of my wife's, Sir\r\nJohn Glanville, a famous lawyer, formerly Speaker of the House of\r\nCommons; his seat is at Broad Hinton, where he now lived but in the\r\ngate-house, his very fair dwelling house having been burnt by his own\r\nhands, to prevent the rebels making a garrison of it. Here, my cousin\r\nWilliam Glanville's eldest son showed me such a lock for a door, that for\r\nits filing, and rare contrivances was a masterpiece, yet made by a\r\ncountry blacksmith. But, we have seen watches made by another with as\r\nmuch curiosity as the best of that profession can brag of; and, not many\r\nyears after, there was nothing more frequent than all sorts of ironwork\r\nmore exquisitely wrought and polished than in any part of Europe, so as a\r\ndoor lock of a tolerable price was esteemed a curiosity even among\r\nforeign princes.\r\n\r\nWent back to Cadenham, and, on the 19th, to Sir Edward Baynton's at Spie\r\nPark, a place capable of being made a noble seat; but the humorous old\r\nknight has built a long single house of two low stories on the precipice\r\nof an incomparable prospect, and landing on a bowling-green in the park.\r\nThe house is like a long barn, and has not a window on the prospect side.\r\nAfter dinner, they went to bowls, and, in the meantime, our coachmen were\r\nmade so exceedingly drunk, that in returning home we escaped great\r\ndangers. This, it seems, was by order of the knight, that all gentlemen's\r\nservants be so treated; but the custom is barbarous, and much unbecoming\r\na knight still less a Christian.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SALISBURY]\r\n\r\n20th July, 1654. We proceeded to Salisbury; the cathedral I take to be\r\nthe most complete piece of Gothic work in Europe, taken in all its\r\nuniformity. The pillars, reputed to be cast, are of stone manifestly cut\r\nout of the quarry; most observable are those in the chapter house. There\r\nare some remarkable monuments, particularly the ancient Bishops, founders\r\nof the Church, Knights Templars, the Marquis of Hertford's, the cloisters\r\nof the palace and garden, and the great mural dial.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we went to Wilton, a fine house of the Earl of Pembroke,\r\nin which the most observable are the dining room in the modern-built\r\npart toward the garden, richly gilded and painted with story, by De\r\nCrete; also some other apartments, as that of hunting landscapes, by\r\nPierce; some magnificent chimney-pieces, after the best French manner; a\r\npair of artificial winding stairs of stone, and divers rare pictures. The\r\ngarden, heretofore esteemed the noblest in England, is a large handsome\r\nplain, with a grotto and waterworks, which might be made much more\r\npleasant, were the river that passes through cleansed and raised; for all\r\nis effected by a mere force. It has a flower garden, not inelegant. But,\r\nafter all, that which renders the seat delightful is, its being so near\r\nthe downs and noble plains about the country contiguous to it. The\r\nstables are well ordered and yield a graceful front, by reason of the\r\nwalks of lime trees, with the court and fountain of the stables adorned\r\nwith the Cæsars' heads.\r\n\r\nWe returned this evening by the plain, and fourteen-mile race, where out\r\nof my lord's hare warren we were entertained with a long course of a hare\r\nfor near two miles in sight. Near this, is a _pergola_, or stand, built\r\nto view the sports; and so we came to Salisbury, and saw the most\r\nconsiderable parts of the city. The market place, with most of the\r\nstreets, are watered by a quick current and pure stream running through\r\nthe middle of them, but are negligently kept, when with a small charge\r\nthey might be purged and rendered infinitely agreeable, and this made one\r\nof the sweetest towns, but now the common buildings are despicable, and\r\nthe streets dirty.\r\n\r\n22d July, 1654. We departed and dined at a farm of my Uncle Hungerford's,\r\ncalled Darnford Magna, situated in a valley under the plain, most sweetly\r\nwatered, abounding in trouts caught by spear in the night, when they come\r\nattracted by a light set in the stern of a boat.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, continuing our return, we passed over the goodly plain, or\r\nrather sea of carpet, which I think for evenness, extent, verdure, and\r\ninnumerable flocks, to be one of the most delightful prospects in nature,\r\nand reminded me of the pleasant lives of shepherds we read of in\r\nromances.\r\n\r\nNow we arrived at Stonehenge, indeed a stupendous monument, appearing at\r\na distance like a castle; how so many and huge pillars of stone should\r\nhave been brought together, some erect, others transverse on the tops of\r\nthem, in a circular area as rudely representing a cloister or heathen and\r\nmore natural temple, is wonderful. The stone is so exceedingly hard, that\r\nall my strength with a hammer could not break a fragment; which hardness\r\nI impute to their so long exposure. To number them exactly is very\r\ndifficult, they lie in such variety of postures and confusion, though\r\nthey seemed not to exceed 100; we counted only 95. As to their being\r\nbrought thither, there being no navigable river near, is by some admired;\r\nbut for the stone, there seems to be the same kind about 20 miles\r\ndistant, some of which appear above ground. About the same hills, are\r\ndivers mounts raised, conceived to be ancient intrenchments, or places of\r\nburial, after bloody fights. We now went by Devizes, a reasonable large\r\ntown, and came late to Cadenham.\r\n\r\n27th July, 1654. To the hunting of a sorel deer, and had excellent chase\r\nfor four or five hours, but the venison little worth.\r\n\r\n29th July, 1654. I went to Langford to see my Cousin Stephens. I also saw\r\nDryfield, the house heretofore of Sir John Pretyman, grandfather to my\r\nwife, and sold by her uncle; both the seat and house very honorable and\r\nwell built, much after the modern fashion.\r\n\r\n31st July, 1654. Taking leave of Cadenham, where we had been long and\r\nnobly entertained, we went a compass into Leicestershire, where dwelt\r\nanother relation of my wife's; for I indeed made these excursions to show\r\nher the most considerable parts of her native country, who, from her\r\nchildhood, had lived altogether in France, as well as for my own\r\ncuriosity and information.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GLOUCESTER]\r\n\r\nAbout two miles before coming to Gloucester, we have a prospect from\r\nwoody hills into a most goodly vale and country. Gloucester is a handsome\r\ncity, considerable for the church and monuments. The minster is indeed a\r\nnoble fabric. The whispering gallery is rare, being through a passage of\r\ntwenty-five yards in a many-angled cloister, and was, I suppose, either\r\nto show the skill of the architect, or some invention of a cunning\r\npriest, who, standing unseen in a recess in the middle of the chapel,\r\nmight hear whatever was spoken at either end. This is above the choir, in\r\nwhich lies buried King Stephen[50] under a monument of Irish oak, not ill\r\ncarved considering the age. The new library is a noble though a private\r\ndesign. I was likewise pleased with the Severn gliding so sweetly by it.\r\nThe Duke's house, the castle works, are now almost quite dismantled; nor\r\nyet without sad thoughts did I see the town, considering how fatal the\r\nsiege had been a few years before to our good King.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 50: King Stephen was buried at Faversham. The effigy\r\n    Evelyn alluded to is that of Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy.]\r\n\r\n1st August, 1654. We set out toward Worcester, by a way thickly planted\r\nwith cider fruit. We deviated to the Holy Wells, trickling out of a\r\nvalley through a steep declivity toward the foot of the great Malvern\r\nHills; they are said to heal many infirmities, as king's evil, leprosy,\r\nsore eyes, etc. Ascending a great height above them to the trench\r\ndividing England from South Wales, we had the prospect of all\r\nHerefordshire, Radnor, Brecknoch, Monmouth, Worcester, Gloucester,\r\nShropshire, Warwick, Derbyshires, and many more. We could discern\r\nTewkesbury, King's road, toward Bristol, etc.; so as I esteem it one of\r\nthe goodliest vistas in England.\r\n\r\n2d August, 1654. This evening we arrived at Worcester, the Judges of\r\nAssize and Sheriff just entering as we did. Viewing the town the next\r\nday, we found the Cathedral much ruined by the late wars, otherwise a\r\nnoble structure. The town is neatly paved and very clean, the goodly\r\nriver Severn running by it, and standing in a most fertile country.\r\n\r\n3d August, 1654. We passed next through Warwick, and saw the castle, the\r\ndwelling house of the Lord Brook, and the furniture noble. It is built on\r\nan eminent rock which gives prospect into a most goodly green, a woody\r\nand plentifully watered country; the river running so delightfully under\r\nit, that it may pass for one of the most surprising seats one should meet\r\nwith. The gardens are prettily disposed; but might be much improved. Here\r\nthey showed us Sir Guy's great two-handed sword, staff, horse-arms, pot,\r\nand other relics of that famous knight-errant. Warwick is a fair old\r\ntown, and hath one church full of ancient monuments.\r\n\r\nHaving viewed these, I went to visit my worthy friend, Sir H. Puckering,\r\nat the Abbey, and though a melancholy old seat, yet in a rich soil.\r\n\r\nHence to Sir Guy's grot, where they say he did his penances, and died. It\r\nis a squalid den made in the rock, crowned yet with venerable oaks and\r\nlooking on a goodly stream, so as, were it improved as it might be, it\r\nwere capable of being made a most romantic and pleasant place. Near this,\r\nwe were showed his chapel and gigantic statue hewn out of the solid rock,\r\nout of which there are likewise divers other caves cut, and some very\r\ncapacious.\r\n\r\nThe next place to Coventry. The cross is remarkable for Gothic work and\r\nrich gilding, comparable to any I had ever seen, except that of Cheapside\r\nin London, now demolished. This city has many handsome churches, a\r\nbeautiful wall, a fair free school and library to it; the streets full of\r\ngreat shops, clean and well paved. At going forth the gate, they show us\r\nthe bone, or rib, of a wild boar, said to have been killed by Sir Guy,\r\nbut which I take to be the chine of a whale.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LEICESTER]\r\n\r\n4th August, 1654. Hence, riding through a considerable part of\r\nLeicestershire, an open, rich, but unpleasant country, we came late in\r\nthe evening to Horninghold, a seat of my wife's uncle.\r\n\r\n7th August, 1654. Went to Uppingham, the shire town of Rutland, pretty\r\nand well built of stone, which is a rarity in that part of England, where\r\nmost of the rural parishes are but of mud; and the people living as\r\nwretchedly as in the most impoverished parts of France, which they much\r\nresemble, being idle and sluttish. The country (especially\r\nLeicestershire) much in common; the gentry free drinkers.\r\n\r\n9th August, 1654. To the old and ragged city of Leicester, large and\r\npleasantly seated, but despicably built, the chimney flues like so many\r\nsmiths' forges; however, famous for the tomb of the tyrant, Richard III.,\r\nwhich is now converted to a cistern, at which (I think) cattle drink.\r\nAlso, here in one of the churches lies buried the magnificent Cardinal\r\nWolsey. John of Gaunt has here also built a large but poor hospital, near\r\nwhich a wretch has made him a house out of the ruins of a stately church.\r\nSaw the ruins of an old Roman Temple, thought to be of Janus. Entertained\r\nat a very fine collection of fruits, such as I did not expect to meet\r\nwith so far North, especially very good melons. We returned to my\r\nuncle's.\r\n\r\n14th August, 1654. I took a journey into the Northern parts, riding\r\nthrough Oakham, a pretty town in Rutlandshire, famous for the tenure of\r\nthe Barons (Ferrers), who hold it by taking off a shoe from every\r\nnobleman's horse that passes with his lord through the street, unless\r\nredeemed with a certain piece of money. In token of this, are several\r\ngilded shoes nailed up on the castle gate, which seems to have been large\r\nand fair. Hence, we went by Brook, a very sweet seat and park of the old\r\nLady Camden's. Next, by Burleigh House, belonging to the Duke of\r\nBuckingham, and worthily reckoned among the noblest seats in England,\r\nsituate on the brow of a hill, built _à la moderne_ near a park walled\r\nin, and a fine wood at the descent.\r\n\r\nNow we were come to Cottsmore, a pretty seat belonging to Mr. Heath, son\r\nof the late Lord Chief Justice of that name. Here, after dinner, parting\r\nwith the company that conducted us thus far, I passed that evening by\r\nBelvoir Castle, built on a round mount at the point of a long ridge of\r\nhills, which affords a stately prospect, and is famous for its strenuous\r\nresistance in the late civil war.\r\n\r\nWent by Newark-on-Trent, a brave town and garrison. Next, by Wharton\r\nHouse, belonging to the Lord Chaworth, a handsome seat; then by Home, a\r\nnoble place belonging to the Marquis of Dorchester, and passed the famous\r\nriver Trent, which divides the South from the North of England; and so\r\nlay that night at Nottingham.\r\n\r\nThis whole town and county seems to be but one entire rock, as it were,\r\nan exceedingly pleasant shire, full of gentry. Here, I observed divers to\r\nlive in the rocks and caves, much after the manner as about Tours, in\r\nFrance. The church is well built on an eminence; there is a fair house of\r\nthe Lord Clare's, another of Pierrepont's; an ample market place; large\r\nstreets, full of crosses; the relics of an ancient castle, hollowed\r\nbeneath which are many caverns, especially that of the Scots' King, and\r\nhis work while there.\r\n\r\nThis place is remarkable for being the place where his Majesty first\r\nerected his standard at the beginning of our late unhappy differences.\r\nThe prospects from this city toward the river and meadows are most\r\ndelightful.\r\n\r\n15th August, 1654. We passed next through Sherwood Forest, accounted the\r\nmost extensive in England. Then, Paplewick, an incomparable vista with\r\nthe pretty castle near it. Thence, we saw Newstead Abbey, belonging to\r\nthe Lord Byron, situated much like Fontainebleau in France, capable of\r\nbeing made a noble seat, accommodated as it is with brave woods and\r\nstreams; it has yet remaining the front of a glorious abbey church. Next,\r\nby Mansfield town; then Welbeck, the house of the Marquis of Newcastle,\r\nseated in a bottom in a park, and environed with woods, a noble yet\r\nmelancholy seat. The palace is a handsome and stately building. Next to\r\nWorksop Abbey, almost demolished; the church has a double flat tower\r\nentire, and a pretty gate. The manor belongs to the Earl of Arundel, and\r\nhas to it a fair house at the foot of a hill in a park that affords a\r\ndelicate prospect. Tickel, a town and castle, has a very noble prospect.\r\nAll these in Nottinghamshire.\r\n\r\n16th August, 1654. We arrived at Doncaster, where we lay this night; it\r\nis a large fair town, famous for great wax lights, and good stockings.\r\n\r\n17th August, 1654. Passed through Pontefract; the castle famous for many\r\nsieges both of late and ancient times, and the death of that unhappy King\r\nmurdered in it (Richard II.), was now demolishing by the Rebels; it\r\nstands on a mount, and makes a goodly show at a distance. The Queen has a\r\nhouse here, and there are many fair seats near it, especially Mr.\r\nPierrepont's, built at the foot of a hill out of the castle ruins. We all\r\nalighted in the highway to drink at a crystal spring, which they call\r\nRobin Hood's Well; near it, is a stone chair, and an iron ladle to drink\r\nout of, chained to the seat. We rode to Tadcaster, at the side of which\r\nwe have prospect of the Archbishop's Palace (which is a noble seat), and\r\nin sight of divers other gentlemen's fair houses. This tract is a goodly,\r\nfertile, well-watered, and wooded country, abounding with pasture and\r\nplenty of provisions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: YORK]\r\n\r\nTo York, the second city of England, fairly walled, of a circular form,\r\nwatered by the brave river Ouse, bearing vessels of considerable burden\r\non it; over it is a stone bridge emulating that of London, and built on;\r\nthe middle arch is larger than any I have seen in England, with a wharf\r\nof hewn stone, which makes the river appear very neat. But most\r\nremarkable and worth seeing is St. Peter's Cathedral, which of all the\r\ngreat churches in England had been best preserved from the fury of the\r\nsacrilegious, by composition with the Rebels when they took the city,\r\nduring the many incursions of Scotch and others. It is a most entire\r\nmagnificent piece of Gothic architecture. The screen before the choir is\r\nof stone carved with flowers, running work and statues of the old kings.\r\nMany of the monuments are very ancient. Here, as a great rarity in these\r\ndays and at this time, they showed me a Bible and Common Prayer Book\r\ncovered with crimson velvet, and richly embossed with silver gilt; also a\r\nservice for the altar of gilt wrought plate, flagons, basin, ewer,\r\nplates, chalices, patins, etc., with a gorgeous covering for the altar\r\nand pulpit, carefully preserved in the vestry, in the hollow wall whereof\r\nrises a plentiful spring of excellent water. I got up to the tower,\r\nwhence we had a prospect toward Durham, and could see Ripon, part of\r\nLancashire, the famous and fatal Marston Moor, the Spas of Knaresborough,\r\nand all the environs of that admirable country. Sir ---- Ingoldsby has\r\nhere a large house, gardens, and tennis court; also the King's house and\r\nchurch near the castle, which was modernly fortified with a palisade and\r\nbastions. The streets are narrow and ill-paved, the shops like London.\r\n\r\n18th August, 1654. We went to Beverley, a large town with two stately\r\nchurches, St. John's and St. Mary's, not much inferior to the best of our\r\ncathedrals. Here a very old woman showed us the monuments, and, being\r\nabove 100 years of age, spoke the language of Queen Mary's days, in whose\r\ntime she was born; she was widow of a sexton who had belonged to the\r\nchurch a hundred years.\r\n\r\nHence, we passed through a fenny but rich country to Hull, situated like\r\nCalais, modernly and strongly fortified with three block-houses of brick\r\nand earth. It has a good market place and harbor for ships. Famous also\r\n(or rather infamous) is this town for Hotham's refusing entrance to his\r\nMajesty. The water-house is worth seeing. And here ends the south of\r\nYorkshire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LINCOLN]\r\n\r\n19th August, 1654. We pass the Humber, an arm of the sea of about two\r\nleagues breadth. The weather was bad, but we crossed it in a good barge\r\nto Barton, the first town in that part of Lincolnshire. All marsh ground\r\ntill we came to Brigg, famous for the plantations of licorice, and then\r\nhad brave pleasant riding to Lincoln, much resembling Salisbury Plain.\r\nLincoln is an old confused town, very long, uneven, steep, and ragged;\r\nformerly full of good houses, especially churches and abbeys. The Minster\r\nalmost comparable to that of York itself, abounding with marble pillars,\r\nand having a fair front (herein was interred Queen Eleanora, the loyal\r\nand loving wife who sucked the poison out of her husband's wound); the\r\nabbot founder, with rare carving in the stone; the great bell, or Tom, as\r\nthey call it. I went up the steeple, from whence is a goodly prospect all\r\nover the country. The soldiers had lately knocked off most of the brasses\r\nfrom the gravestones, so as few inscriptions were left; they told us that\r\nthese men went in with axes and hammers, and shut themselves in, till\r\nthey had rent and torn off some barge loads of metal, not sparing even\r\nthe monuments of the dead; so hellish an avarice possessed them: beside\r\nwhich, they exceedingly ruined the city.\r\n\r\nHere, I saw a tall woman six feet two inches high, comely, middle-aged,\r\nand well-proportioned, who kept a very neat and clean alehouse, and got\r\nmost by people's coming to see her on account of her height.\r\n\r\n20th August, 1654. From hence we had a most pleasant ride over a large\r\nheath open like Salisbury Plain, to Grantham, a pretty town, so well\r\nsituated on the side of a bottom which is large and at a distance\r\nenvironed with ascending grounds, that for pleasure I consider it\r\ncomparable to most inland places of England; famous is the steeple for\r\nthe exceeding height of the shaft, which is of stone.\r\n\r\nAbout eighteen miles south, we pass by a noble seat, and see Boston at a\r\ndistance. Here, we came to a parish of which the parson had tithe ale.\r\n\r\nThence through Rutland, we brought night to Horninghold, from whence I\r\nset out on this excursion.\r\n\r\n22d August, 1654. I went a setting and hawking, where we had tolerable\r\nsport.\r\n\r\n25th August, 1654. To see Kirby, a very noble house of my Lord Hatton's,\r\nin Northamptonshire, built _à la moderne_; the garden and stables\r\nagreeable, but the avenue ungraceful, and the seat naked: returned that\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n27th August, 1654. Mr. Allington preached an excellent discourse from\r\nRomans vi. 19. This was he who published those bold sermons of the\r\nmembers warring against the mind, or the Jews crucifying Christ, applied\r\nto the wicked regicides; for which he was ruined. We had no sermon in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n30th August, 1654. Taking leave of my friends, who had now feasted me\r\nmore than a month, I, with my wife, etc., set our faces toward home, and\r\ngot this evening to Peterborough, passing by a stately palace (Thorpe) of\r\nSt. John's (one deep in the blood of our good king), built out of the\r\nruins of the Bishop's palace and cloister. The church is exceeding fair,\r\nfull of monuments of great antiquity. Here lies Queen Catherine, the\r\nunhappy wife of Henry VIII., and the no less unfortunate Mary, Queen of\r\nScots. On the steeple, we viewed the fens of Lincolnshire, now much\r\ninclosed and drained with infinite expense, and by many sluices, cuts,\r\nmounds, and ingenious mills, and the like inventions; at which the city\r\nand country about it consisting of a poor and very lazy sort of people,\r\nwere much displeased.\r\n\r\nPeterborough is a handsome town, and hath another well-built church.\r\n\r\n31st August, 1654. Through part of Huntingdonshire, we passed that town,\r\nfair and ancient, a river running by it. The country about it so abounds\r\nin wheat that, when any King of England passes through it, they have a\r\ncustom to meet him with a hundred plows.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAMBRIDGE]\r\n\r\nThis evening, to Cambridge; and went first to St. John's College, well\r\nbuilt of brick, and library, which I think is the fairest of that\r\nUniversity. One Mr. Benlowes has given it all the ornaments of _pietra\r\ncommessa_,[51] whereof a table and one piece of perspective is very fine;\r\nother trifles there also be of no great value, besides a vast old\r\nsong-book, or Service, and some fair manuscripts. There hangs in the\r\nlibrary the picture of John Williams, Archbishop of York, sometime Lord\r\nKeeper, my kinsman, and their great benefactor.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 51: Marble, inlaid of various colors, representing\r\n    flowers, birds, etc.]\r\n\r\nTrinity College is said by some to be the fairest quadrangle of any\r\nuniversity in Europe; but in truth is far inferior to that of Christ\r\nChurch, in Oxford; the hall is ample and of stone, the fountain in the\r\nquadrangle is graceful, the chapel and library fair. There they showed us\r\nthe prophetic manuscript of the famous Grebner, but the passage and\r\nemblem which they would apply to our late King, is manifestly relating to\r\nthe Swedish; in truth, it seems to be a mere fantastic rhapsody, however\r\nthe title may bespeak strange revelations. There is an office in\r\nmanuscript with fine miniatures, and some other antiquities, given by the\r\nCountess of Richmond, mother of Henry VIII., and the before-mentioned\r\nArchbishop Williams, when Bishop of Lincoln. The library is pretty well\r\nstored. The Greek Professor had me into another large quadrangle\r\ncloistered and well built, and gave us a handsome collation in his own\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nThence to Caius, and afterward to King's College, where I found the\r\nchapel altogether answered expectation, especially the roof, all of\r\nstone, which for the flatness of its laying and carving may, I conceive,\r\nvie with any in Christendom. The contignation of the roof (which I went\r\nupon), weight, and artificial joining of the stones is admirable. The\r\nlights are also very fair. In one aisle lies the famous Dr. Collins, so\r\ncelebrated for his fluency in the Latin tongue. From this roof we could\r\ndescry Ely, and the encampment of Sturbridge fair now beginning to set up\r\ntheir tents and booths; also Royston, Newmarket, etc., houses belonging\r\nto the King. The library is too narrow.\r\n\r\nClare-Hall is of a new and noble design, but not finished.\r\n\r\nPeter-House, formerly under the government of my worthy friend, Dr.\r\nJoseph Cosin, Dean of Peterborough; a pretty neat college, having a\r\ndelicate chapel. Next to Sidney, a fine college.\r\n\r\nCatherine-Hall, though a mean structure, is yet famous for the learned\r\nBishop Andrews, once Master. Emanuel College, that zealous house, where\r\nto the hall they have a parlor for the Fellows. The chapel is reformed,\r\n_ab origine_, built north and south, and meanly erected, as is the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nJesus-College, one of the best built, but in a melancholy situation. Next\r\nto Christ-College, a very noble erection, especially the modern part,\r\nbuilt without the quadrangle toward the gardens, of exact architecture.\r\n\r\nThe Schools are very despicable, and Public Library but mean, though\r\nsomewhat improved by the wainscoting and books lately added by the Bishop\r\nBancroft's library and MSS. They showed us little of antiquity, only King\r\nJames's Works, being his own gift, and kept very reverently.\r\n\r\nThe market place is very ample, and remarkable for old Hobson, the\r\npleasant carrier's beneficence of a fountain.[52] But the whole town is\r\nsituate in a low, dirty, unpleasant place, the streets ill-paved, the air\r\nthick and infected by the fens, nor are its churches, (of which St.\r\nMary's is the best) anything considerable in compare to Oxford.[53]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 52: A conduit it should rather be called.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 53: The reader must remember that an Oxford man is\r\n    speaking.]\r\n\r\nFrom Cambridge, we went to Audley-End, and spent some time in seeing that\r\ngoodly place built by Howard, Earl of Suffolk, once Lord Treasurer. It is\r\na mixed fabric, between antique and modern, but observable for its being\r\ncompletely finished, and without comparison is one of the stateliest\r\npalaces in the kingdom. It consists of two courts, the first very large,\r\nwinged with cloisters. The front had a double entrance; the hall is fair,\r\nbut somewhat too small for so august a pile. The kitchen is very large,\r\nas are the cellars, arched with stone, very neat and well disposed; these\r\noffices are joined by a wing out of the way very handsomely. The gallery\r\nis the most cheerful and I think one of the best in England; a fair\r\ndining-room, and the rest of the lodgings answerable, with a pretty\r\nchapel. The gardens are not in order, though well inclosed. It has also a\r\nbowling-alley, a noble well-walled, wooded and watered park, full of fine\r\n_collines_ and ponds: the river glides before the palace, to which is an\r\navenue of lime trees, but all this is much diminished by its being placed\r\nin an obscure bottom. For the rest, is a perfectly uniform structure, and\r\nshows without like a diadem, by the decorations of the cupolas and other\r\nornaments on the pavilions; instead of rails and balusters, there is a\r\nborder of capital letters, as was lately also on Suffolk-House, near\r\nCharing-Cross, built by the same Lord Treasurer.\r\n\r\nThis house stands in the parish of Saffron Walden, famous for the\r\nabundance of saffron there cultivated, and esteemed the best of any\r\nforeign country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n3d October, 1654. Having dined here, we passed through Bishop Stortford,\r\na pretty watered town, and so by London, late home to Sayes Court, after\r\na journey of 700 miles, but for the variety an agreeable refreshment\r\nafter my turmoil and building.\r\n\r\n10th October, 1654. To my brother at Wotton, who had been sick.\r\n\r\n14th October, 1654. I went to visit my noble friend Mr. Hyldiard, where I\r\nmet that learned gentleman, my Lord Aungier, and Dr. Stokes, one of his\r\nMajesty's chaplains.\r\n\r\n15th October, 1654. To Betchworth Castle, to Sir Ambrose Browne, and\r\nother gentlemen of my sweet and native country.\r\n\r\n24th October, 1654. The good old parson, Higham, preached at Wotton\r\nChurch: a plain preacher, but innocent and honest man.\r\n\r\n23d November, 1654. I went to London, to visit my cousin Fanshawe, and\r\nthis day I saw one of the rarest collections of agates, onyxes, and\r\nintaglios, that I had ever seen either at home or abroad, collected by a\r\nconceited old hatmaker in Blackfriars, especially one agate vase,\r\nheretofore the great Earl of Leicester's.\r\n\r\n28th November, 1654. Came Lady Langham, a kinswoman of mine, to visit us;\r\nalso one Captain Cooke, esteemed the best singer, after the Italian\r\nmanner, of any in England; he entertained us with his voice and theorbo.\r\n\r\n30th November, 1654. My birthday, being the 34th year of my age: blessing\r\nGod for his providence, I went to London to visit my brother.\r\n\r\n3d December, 1654. Advent Sunday. There being no Office at the church but\r\nextemporary prayers after the Presbyterian way, for now all forms were\r\nprohibited, and most of the preachers were usurpers, I seldom went to\r\nchurch upon solemn feasts; but, either went to London, where some of the\r\northodox sequestered divines did privately use the Common Prayer,\r\nadminister sacraments, etc., or else I procured one to officiate in my\r\nhouse; wherefore, on the 10th, Dr. Richard Owen, the sequestered minister\r\nof Eltham, preached to my family in my library, and gave us the Holy\r\nCommunion.\r\n\r\n25th December, 1654. Christmas day. No public offices in churches, but\r\npenalties on observers, so as I was constrained to celebrate it at home.\r\n\r\n1st January, 1654-55. Having with my family performed the public offices\r\nof the day, and begged a blessing on the year I was now entering, I went\r\nto keep the rest of Christmas at my brother's, R. Evelyn, at Woodcot.\r\n\r\n19th January, 1655. My wife was brought to bed of another son, being my\r\nthird, but second living. Christened on the 26th by the name of John.\r\n\r\n28th January, 1655. A stranger preached from Colossians iii. 2, inciting\r\nour affections to the obtaining heavenly things. I understood afterward\r\nthat this man had been both chaplain and lieutenant to Admiral Penn,\r\nusing both swords; whether ordained or not I cannot say; into such times\r\nwere we fallen!\r\n\r\n24th February, 1655. I was showed a table clock whose balance was only a\r\ncrystal ball, sliding on parallel wires, without being at all fixed, but\r\nrolling from stage to stage till falling on a spring concealed from\r\nsight, it was thrown up to the utmost channel again, made with an\r\nimperceptible declivity, in this continual vicissitude of motion prettily\r\nentertaining the eye every half minute, and the next half giving progress\r\nto the hand that showed the hour, and giving notice by a small bell, so\r\nas in 120 half minutes, or periods of the bullet's falling on the\r\nejaculatory spring, the clock part struck. This very extraordinary piece\r\n(richly adorned) had been presented by some German prince to our late\r\nking, and was now in the possession of the usurper; valued at £200.\r\n\r\n2d March, 1655. Mr. Simpson, the King's jeweler, showed me a most rich\r\nagate cup, of an escalop-shape, and having a figure of Cleopatra at the\r\nscroll, her body, hair, mantle, and veil, of the several natural colors.\r\nIt was supported by a half Mark Antony, the colors rarely natural, and\r\nthe work truly antique, but I conceived they were of several pieces; had\r\nthey been all of one stone, it were invaluable.\r\n\r\n18th March, 1655. Went to London, on purpose to hear that excellent\r\npreacher, Dr. Jeremy Taylor, on Matt. xiv. 17, showing what were the\r\nconditions of obtaining eternal life; also, concerning abatements for\r\nunavoidable infirmities, how cast on the accounts of the cross. On the\r\n31st, I made a visit to Dr. Jeremy Taylor, to confer with him about some\r\nspiritual matters, using him thenceforward as my ghostly father. I\r\nbeseech God Almighty to make me ever mindful of, and thankful for, his\r\nheavenly assistances!\r\n\r\n2d April, 1655. This was the first week, that, my uncle Pretyman being\r\nparted with his family from me, I began housekeeping, till now sojourning\r\nwith him in my own house.\r\n\r\n9th April, 1655. I went to see the great ship newly built by the usurper,\r\nOliver, carrying ninety-six brass guns, and 1,000 tons burden. In the\r\nprow was Oliver on horseback, trampling six nations under foot, a Scot,\r\nIrishman, Dutchman, Frenchman, Spaniard, and English, as was easily made\r\nout by their several habits. A Fame held a laurel over his insulting\r\nhead; the word, GOD WITH US.\r\n\r\n15th April, 1655. I went to London with my family, to celebrate the feast\r\nof Easter. Dr. Wild preached at St. Gregory's; the ruling Powers\r\nconniving at the use of the Liturgy, etc., in the church alone. In the\r\nafternoon, Mr. Pierson (since Bishop of Chester) preached at Eastcheap,\r\nbut was disturbed by an alarm of fire, which about this time was very\r\nfrequent in the city.\r\n\r\n29th May, 1655. I sold Preston to Colonel Morley.\r\n\r\n17th June, 1655. There was a collection for the persecuted churches and\r\nChristians in Savoy, remnants of the ancient Albigenses.\r\n\r\n3d July, 1655. I was shown a pretty Terella, described with all the\r\ncircles, and showing all the magnetic deviations.\r\n\r\n14th July, 1655. Came Mr. Pratt, my old acquaintance at Rome, also Sir\r\nEdward Hales, Sir Joseph Tufton, with Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n1st August, 1655. I went to Dorking, to see Mr. Charles Howard's\r\namphitheater, garden, or solitary recess, being fifteen acres environed\r\nby a hill. He showed us divers rare plants, caves, and an elaboratory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ALBURY]\r\n\r\n10th August, 1655. To Albury, to visit Mr. Howard, who had begun to\r\nbuild, and alter the gardens much. He showed me many rare pictures,\r\nparticularly the Moor on horseback; Erasmus, as big as the life, by\r\nHolbein; a Madonna, in miniature, by Oliver; but, above all, the skull,\r\ncarved in wood, by Albert Durer, for which his father was offered £100;\r\nalso Albert's head, by himself, with divers rare agates, intaglios, and\r\nother curiosities.\r\n\r\n21st August, 1655. I went to Ryegate, to visit Mrs. Cary, at my Lady\r\nPeterborough's, in an ancient monastery well in repair, but the park much\r\ndefaced; the house is nobly furnished. The chimney-piece in the great\r\nchamber, carved in wood, was of Henry VIII., and was taken from a house\r\nof his in Bletchingley. At Ryegate, was now the Archbishop of Armagh, the\r\nlearned James Usher, whom I went to visit. He received me exceeding\r\nkindly. In discourse with him, he told me how great the loss of time was\r\nto study much the Eastern languages; that, excepting Hebrew, there was\r\nlittle fruit to be gathered of exceeding labor; that, besides some\r\nmathematical books, the Arabic itself had little considerable; that the\r\nbest text was the Hebrew Bible; that the Septuagint was finished in\r\nseventy days, but full of errors, about which he was then writing; that\r\nSt. Hierome's was to be valued next the Hebrew; also that the seventy\r\ntranslated the Pentateuch only, the rest was finished by others; that the\r\nItalians at present understood but little Greek, and Kircher was a\r\nmountebank; that Mr. Selden's best book was his \"Titles of Honor\"; that\r\nthe church would be destroyed by sectaries, who would in all likelihood\r\nbring in Popery. In conclusion he recommended to me the study of\r\nphilology, above all human studies; and so, with his blessing, I took my\r\nleave of this excellent person, and returned to Wotton.\r\n\r\n27th August, 1655. I went to Boxhill, to see those rare natural bowers,\r\ncabinets, and shady walks in the box copses: hence we walked to\r\nMickleham, and saw Sir F. Stidolph's seat, environed with elm trees and\r\nwalnuts innumerable, and of which last he told us they received a\r\nconsiderable revenue. Here are such goodly walks and hills shaded with\r\nyew and box, as render the place extremely agreeable, it seeming from\r\nthese evergreens to be summer all the winter.\r\n\r\n28th August, 1655. Came that renowned mathematician, Mr. Oughtred, to see\r\nme, I sending my coach to bring him to Wotton, being now very aged. Among\r\nother discourse, he told me he thought water to be the philosopher's\r\nfirst matter, and that he was well persuaded of the possibility of their\r\nelixir; he believed the sun to be a material fire, the moon a continent,\r\nas appears by the late selenographers; he had strong apprehensions of\r\nsome extraordinary event to happen the following year, from the\r\ncalculation of coincidence with the diluvian period; and added that it\r\nmight possibly be to convert the Jews by our Savior's visible appearance,\r\nor to judge the world; and therefore, his word was, \"_Parate in\r\noccursum_\"; he said original sin was not met with in the Greek Fathers,\r\nyet he believed the thing; this was from some discourse on Dr. Taylor's\r\nlate book, which I had lent him.\r\n\r\n16th September, 1655. Preached at St. Gregory's one Darnel, on Psalm iv.\r\n4, concerning the benefit of self-examination; more learning in SO SHORT\r\nA TIME AS AN HOUR I have seldom heard.\r\n\r\n17th September, 1655. Received £2,600 of Mr. Hurt, for the Manor of\r\nWarley Magna, in Essex, purchased by me some time since. The taxes were\r\nso intolerable that they ate up the rents, etc., surcharged as that\r\ncounty had been above all others during our unnatural war.\r\n\r\n19th September, 1655. Came to see me Sir Edward Hales, Mr. Ashmole, Mr.\r\nHarlakenton, and Mr. Thornhill: and, the next day, I visited Sir Henry\r\nNewton at Charlton, where I met the Earl of Winchelsea and Lady\r\nBeauchamp, daughter to the Lord Capel.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday afternoon, I frequently staid at home to catechize and instruct\r\nmy family, those exercises universally ceasing in the parish churches, so\r\nas people had no principles, and grew very ignorant of even the common\r\npoints of Christianity; all devotion being now placed in hearing sermons\r\nand discourses of speculative and national things.\r\n\r\n26th September, 1655. I went to see Colonel Blount's subterranean warren,\r\nand drank of the wine of his vineyard, which was good for little.\r\n\r\n30th September, 1655. Sir Nicholas Crisp came to treat with me about his\r\nvast design of a mole to be made for ships in part of my grounds at Sayes\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n3d November, 1655. I had accidentally discourse with a Persian and a\r\nGreek concerning the devastation of Poland by the late incursion of the\r\nSwedes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n27th November, 1655. To London about Sir Nicholas Crisp's designs.\r\n\r\nI went to see York House and gardens, belonging to the former great\r\nBuckingham, but now much ruined through neglect.\r\n\r\nThence, to visit honest and learned Mr. Hartlib, a public spirited and\r\ningenious person, who had propagated many useful things and arts. He told\r\nme of the castles which they set for ornament on their stoves in Germany\r\n(he himself being a Lithuanian, as I remember), which are furnished with\r\nsmall ordnance of silver on the battlements, out of which they discharge\r\nexcellent perfumes about the rooms, charging them with a little powder to\r\nset them on fire, and disperse the smoke: and in truth no more than need,\r\nfor their stoves are sufficiently nasty. He told me of an ink that would\r\ngive a dozen copies, moist sheets of paper being pressed on it; and\r\nremain perfect; and a receipt how to take off any print without the least\r\ninjury to the original. This gentleman was master of innumerable\r\ncuriosities, and very communicative. I returned home that evening by\r\nwater; and was afflicted for it with a cold that had almost killed me.\r\n\r\nThis day, came forth the Protector's Edict, or Proclamation, prohibiting\r\nall ministers of the Church of England from preaching or teaching any\r\nschools, in which he imitated the apostate, Julian; with the decimation\r\nof all the royal party's revenues throughout England.\r\n\r\n14th December, 1655. I visited Mr. Hobbes, the famous philosopher of\r\nMalmesbury, with whom I had been long acquainted in France.\r\n\r\nNow were the Jews admitted.\r\n\r\n25th December, 1655. There was no more notice taken of Christmas-day in\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nI went to London, where Dr. Wild preached the funeral sermon of\r\nPreaching, this being the last day; after which Cromwell's proclamation\r\nwas to take place, that none of the Church of England should dare either\r\nto preach, or administer Sacraments, teach schools, etc., on pain of\r\nimprisonment, or exile. So this was the most mournful day that in my life\r\nI had seen, or the Church of England herself, since the Reformation; to\r\nthe great rejoicing of both Papist and Presbyter.[54] So pathetic was\r\nhis discourse, that it drew many tears from the auditory. Myself, wife,\r\nand some of our family, received the Communion, God make me thankful, who\r\nhath hitherto provided for us the food of our souls as well as bodies!\r\nThe Lord Jesus pity our distressed Church, and bring back the captivity\r\nof Zion!\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 54: The text was 2 Cor. xiii 9. That, however persecution\r\n    dealt with the Ministers of God's Word, they were still to pray for\r\n    the flock, and wish their perfection, as it was the flock to pray\r\n    for and assist their pastors, by the example of St. Paul.--EVELYN'S\r\n    NOTE.]\r\n\r\n5th January, 1655-56. Came to visit me my Lord Lisle, son to the Earl of\r\nLeicester, with Sir Charles Ouseley, two of the Usurper's council; Mr.\r\nJohn Hervey, and John Denham, the poet.\r\n\r\n18th January, 1656. Went to Eltham on foot, being a great frost, but a\r\nmist falling as I returned, gave me such a rheum as kept me within doors\r\nnear a whole month after.\r\n\r\n5th February, 1656. Was shown me a pretty perspective and well\r\nrepresented in a triangular box, the great Church of Haarlem in Holland,\r\nto be seen through a small hole at one of the corners, and contrived into\r\na handsome cabinet. It was so rarely done, that all the artists and\r\npainters in town flocked to see and admire it.\r\n\r\n10th February, 1656. I heard Dr. Wilkins preach before the Lord Mayor in\r\nSt. Paul's, showing how obedience was preferable to sacrifice. He was a\r\nmost obliging person, who had married the Protector's sister, and took\r\ngreat pains to preserve the Universities from the ignorant, sacrilegious\r\ncommanders and soldiers, who would fain have demolished all places and\r\npersons that pretended to learning.\r\n\r\n11th February, 1656. I ventured to go to Whitehall, where of many years I\r\nhad not been, and found it very glorious and well furnished, as far as I\r\ncould safely go, and was glad to find they had not much defaced that rare\r\npiece of Henry VII., etc., done on the walls of the King's privy chamber.\r\n\r\n14th February, 1656. I dined with Mr. Berkeley, son of Lord Berkeley, of\r\nBerkeley Castle, where I renewed my acquaintance with my Lord Bruce, my\r\nfellow-traveler in Italy.\r\n\r\n19th February, 1656. Went with Dr. Wilkins to see Barlow, the famous\r\npainter of fowls, beasts, and birds.\r\n\r\n4th March, 1656. This night I was invited by Mr. Roger L'Estrange to hear\r\nthe incomparable Lubicer on the violin. His variety on a few notes and\r\nplain ground, with that wonderful dexterity, was admirable. Though a\r\nyoung man, yet so perfect and skillful, that there was nothing, however\r\ncross and perplexed, brought to him by our artists, which he did not play\r\noff at sight with ravishing sweetness and improvements, to the\r\nastonishment of our best masters. In sum, he played on the single\r\ninstrument a full concert, so as the rest flung down their instruments,\r\nacknowledging the victory. As to my own particular, I stand to this hour\r\namazed that God should give so great perfection to so young a person.\r\nThere were at that time as excellent in their profession as any were\r\nthought to be in Europe, Paul Wheeler, Mr. Mell, and others, till this\r\nprodigy appeared. I can no longer question the effects we read of in\r\nDavid's harp to charm evil spirits, or what is said some particular notes\r\nproduced in the passions of Alexander, and that King of Denmark.\r\n\r\n12th April, 1656. Mr. Berkeley and Mr. Robert Boyle (that excellent\r\nperson and great virtuoso), Dr. Taylor, and Dr. Wilkins, dined with me at\r\nSayes Court, when I presented Dr. Wilkins with my rare burning-glass. In\r\nthe afternoon, we all went to Colonel Blount's, to see his newly-invented\r\nplows.\r\n\r\n22d April, 1656. Came to see Mr. Henshaw and Sir William Paston's son,\r\nsince Earl of Yarmouth. Afterward, I went to see his Majesty's house at\r\nEltham, both palace and chapel in miserable ruins, the noble woods and\r\npark destroyed by Rich, the rebel.\r\n\r\n6th May, 1656. I brought Monsieur le Franc, a young French Sorbonnist, a\r\nproselyte, to converse with Dr. Taylor; they fell to dispute on original\r\nsin, in Latin, upon a book newly published by the Doctor, who was much\r\nsatisfied with the young man. Thence, to see Mr. Dugdale, our learned\r\nantiquary and herald. Returning, I was shown the three vast volumes of\r\nFather Kircher's, \"_Obeliscus Pamphilius_\" and \"_Ægyptiacus_\"; in the\r\nsecond volume I found the hieroglyphic I first communicated and sent to\r\nhim at Rome by the hands of Mr. Henshaw, whom he mentions; I designed it\r\nfrom the stone itself brought me to Venice from Cairo by Captain Powell.\r\n\r\n7th May, 1656. I visited Dr. Taylor, and prevailed on him to propose\r\nMonsieur le Franc to the Bishop that he might have Orders, I having\r\nsometime before brought him to a full consent to the Church of England,\r\nher doctrine and discipline, in which he had till of late made some\r\ndifficulty; so he was this day ordained both deacon and priest by the\r\nBishop of Meath. I paid the fees to his lordship, who was very poor and\r\nin great want; to that necessity were our clergy reduced! In the\r\nafternoon I met Alderman Robinson, to treat with Mr. Papillion about the\r\nmarriage of my cousin, George Tuke, with Mrs. Fontaine.\r\n\r\n8th May, 1656. I went to visit Dr. Wilkins, at Whitehall, when I first\r\nmet with Sir P. Neal, famous for his optic glasses. Greatorix, the\r\nmathematical instrument maker, showed me his excellent invention to\r\nquench fire.\r\n\r\n12th May, 1656. Was published my \"Essay on Lucretius,\" with innumerable\r\nerrata by the negligence of Mr. Triplet, who undertook the correction of\r\nthe press in my absence. Little of the Epicurean philosophy was then\r\nknown among us.\r\n\r\n28th May, 1656. I dined with Nieuport, the Holland Ambassador, who\r\nreceived me with extraordinary courtesy. I found him a judicious, crafty,\r\nand wise man. He gave me excellent cautions as to the danger of the\r\ntimes, and the circumstances our nation was in. I remember the\r\nobservation he made upon the ill success of our former Parliaments, and\r\ntheir private animosities, and little care of the public.\r\n\r\nCame to visit me the old Marquis of Argyle (since executed), Lord\r\nLothian, and some other Scotch noblemen, all strangers to me. Note, the\r\nMarquis took the turtle-doves in the aviary for owls.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Southampton (since Treasurer) and Mr. Spencer, brother to the\r\nEarl of Sunderland, came to see my garden.\r\n\r\n7th July, 1656. I began my journey to see some parts of the northeast of\r\nEngland; but the weather was so excessively hot and dusty, I shortened my\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n8th July, 1656. To Colchester, a fair town, but now wretchedly demolished\r\nby the late siege, especially the suburbs, which were all burned, but\r\nwere then repairing. The town is built on a rising ground, having fair\r\nmeadows on one side, and a river with a strong ancient castle, said to\r\nhave been built by King Coilus, father of Helena, mother of Constantine\r\nthe Great, of whom I find no memory save at the pinnacle of one of their\r\nwool-staple houses, where is a statue of Coilus, in wood, wretchedly\r\ncarved. The walls are exceedingly strong, deeply trenched, and filled\r\nwith earth. It has six gates, and some watchtowers, and some handsome\r\nchurches. But what was shown us as a kind of miracle, at the outside of\r\nthe Castle, the wall where Sir Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle, those\r\nvaliant and noble persons who so bravely behaved themselves in the last\r\nsiege, were barbarously shot, murdered by Ireton in cold blood, after\r\nsurrendering on articles; having been disappointed of relief from the\r\nScotch army, which had been defeated with the King at Worcester. The\r\nplace was bare of grass for a large space, all the rest of it abounding\r\nwith herbage. For the rest, this is a ragged and factious town, now\r\nswarming with sectaries. Their trading is in cloth with the Dutch, and\r\nbaize and says with Spain; it is the only place in England where these\r\nstuffs are made unsophisticated. It is also famous for oysters and eringo\r\nroot, growing hereabout, and candied for sale.\r\n\r\nWent to Dedham, a pretty country town, having a very fair church, finely\r\nsituated, the valley well watered. Here, I met with Dr. Stokes, a young\r\ngentleman, but an excellent mathematician. This is a clothing town, as\r\nmost are in Essex, but lies in the unwholesome hundreds.\r\n\r\nHence to Ipswich, doubtless one of the sweetest, most pleasant,\r\nwell-built towns in England. It has twelve fair churches, many noble\r\nhouses, especially the Lord Devereux's; a brave quay, and commodious\r\nharbor, being about seven miles from the main; an ample market place.\r\nHere was born the great Cardinal Wolsey, who began a palace here, which\r\nwas not finished.\r\n\r\nI had the curiosity to visit some Quakers here in prison; a new fanatic\r\nsect, of dangerous principles, who show no respect to any man,\r\nmagistrate, or other, and seem a melancholy, proud sort of people, and\r\nexceedingly ignorant. One of these was said to have fasted twenty days;\r\nbut another, endeavoring to do the like, perished on the 10th, when he\r\nwould have eaten, but could not.\r\n\r\n10th July, 1656. I returned homeward, passing again through Colchester;\r\nand, by the way, near the ancient town of Chelmsford, saw New Hall, built\r\nin a park by Henry VII. and VIII., and given by Queen Elizabeth to the\r\nEarl of Sussex, who sold it to the late great Duke of Buckingham, and\r\nsince seized on by Oliver Cromwell (pretended Protector). It is a fair\r\nold house, built with brick, low, being only of two stories, as the\r\nmanner then was; the gate-house better; the court, large and pretty; the\r\nstaircase, of extraordinary wideness, with a piece representing Sir\r\nFrancis Drake's action in the year 1580, an excellent sea-piece; the\r\ngalleries are trifling; the hall is noble; the garden a fair plot, and\r\nthe whole seat well accommodated with water; but, above all, I admired\r\nthe fair avenue planted with stately lime trees, in four rows, for near a\r\nmile in length. It has three descents, which is the only fault, and may\r\nbe reformed. There is another fair walk of the same at the mall and\r\nwilderness, with a tennis-court, and pleasant terrace toward the park,\r\nwhich was well stored with deer and ponds.\r\n\r\n11th July, 1656. Came home by Greenwich ferry, where I saw Sir J.\r\nWinter's project of charring sea-coal, to burn out the sulphur, and\r\nrender it sweet. He did it by burning the coals in such earthen pots as\r\nthe glass men melt their metal, so firing them without consuming them,\r\nusing a bar of iron in each crucible, or pot, which bar has a hook at one\r\nend, that so the coals being melted in a furnace with other crude\r\nsea-coals under them, may be drawn out of the pots sticking to the iron,\r\nwhence they are beaten off in great half-exhausted cinders, which being\r\nrekindled, make a clear, pleasant chamber-fire, deprived of their sulphur\r\nand arsenic malignity. What success it may have, time will discover.[55]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 55: Many years ago, Lord Dundonald revived the project,\r\n    with the proposed improvement of extracting and saving the tar.\r\n    Unfortunately he did not profit by it. The coal thus charred is sold\r\n    as COKE, a very useful fuel for many purposes.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n3d August, 1656. I went to London, to receive the Blessed Sacrament, the\r\nfirst time the Church of England was reduced to a chamber and\r\nconventicle; so sharp was the persecution. The parish churches were\r\nfilled with sectaries of all sorts, blasphemous and ignorant mechanics\r\nusurping the pulpits everywhere. Dr. Wild preached in a private house in\r\nFleet Street, where we had a great meeting of zealous Christians, who\r\nwere generally much more devout and religious than in our greatest\r\nprosperity. In the afternoon, I went to the French Church in the Savoy,\r\nwhere I heard Monsieur d'Espagne catechize, and so returned to my house.\r\n\r\n20th August, 1656. Was a confused election of Parliament called by the\r\nUsurper.\r\n\r\n7th September, 1656. I went to take leave of my excellent neighbor and\r\nfriend, Sir. H. Newton and lady, now going to dwell at Warwick; and Mr.\r\nNeedham, my dear and learned friend, came to visit me.\r\n\r\n14th September, 1656. Now was old Sir Henry Vane[56] sent to Carisbrook\r\nCastle, in Wight, for a foolish book he published; the pretended\r\nProtector fortifying himself exceedingly, and sending many to prison.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 56: Evelyn means the younger Vane. This was \"Vane, young\r\n    in years, but in sage counsel old,\" the nobleness and independence\r\n    of whose character, as well as his claims to the affection of\r\n    posterity, are not ill expressed in the two facts recorded by\r\n    Evelyn--his imprisonment by Cromwell, and his judicial murder by\r\n    Charles II. The foolish book to which Evelyn refers was an able and\r\n    fearless attack on Cromwell's government.]\r\n\r\n2d October, 1656. Came to visit me my cousin, Stephens, and Mr. Pierce\r\n(since head of Magdalen College, Oxford), a learned minister of Brington,\r\nin Northamptonshire, and Captain Cooke, both excellent musicians.\r\n\r\n2d November, 1656. There was now nothing practical preached, or that\r\npressed reformation of life, but high and speculative points and strains\r\nthat few understood, which left people very ignorant, and of no steady\r\nprinciples, the source of all our sects and divisions, for there was much\r\nenvy and uncharity in the world; God of his mercy amend it! Now, indeed,\r\nthat I went at all to church, while these usurpers possessed the pulpits,\r\nwas that I might not be suspected for a Papist, and that, though the\r\nminister was Presbyterianly affected, he yet was as I understood duly\r\nordained, and preached sound doctrine after their way, and besides was an\r\nhumble, harmless, and peaceable man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n25th December, 1656. I went to London, to receive the Blessed Communion,\r\nthis holy festival at Dr. Wild's lodgings, where I rejoiced to find so\r\nfull an assembly of devout and sober Christians.\r\n\r\n26th December, 1656. I invited some of my neighbors and tenants,\r\naccording to custom, and to preserve hospitality and charity.\r\n\r\n28th December, 1656. A stranger preached on Luke xviii. 7, 8, on which he\r\nmade a confused discourse, with a great deal of Greek and ostentation of\r\nlearning, to but little purpose.\r\n\r\n30th December, 1656. Dined with me Sir William Paston's son, Mr. Henshaw,\r\nand Mr. Clayton.\r\n\r\n31st December, 1656. I begged God's blessing and mercies for his goodness\r\nto me the past year, and set my domestic affairs in order.\r\n\r\n1st January, 1656-57. Having prayed with my family, and celebrated the\r\nanniversary, I spent some time in imploring God's blessing the year I was\r\nentered into.\r\n\r\n7th January, 1657. Came Mr. Matthew Wren (since secretary to the Duke),\r\nslain in the Dutch war, eldest son to the Bishop of Ely, now a prisoner\r\nin the Tower; a most worthy and honored gentleman.\r\n\r\n10th January, 1657. Came Dr. Joyliffe, that famous physician and\r\nanatomist, first detector of the lymphatic veins; also the old Marquis of\r\nArgyle, and another Scotch Earl.\r\n\r\n5th February, 1657. Dined at the Holland Ambassador's; he told me the\r\nEast India Company of Holland had constantly a stock of £400,000 in\r\nIndia, and forty-eight men-of-war there: he spoke of their exact and just\r\nkeeping their books and correspondence, so as no adventurer's stock could\r\npossibly be lost, or defeated; that it was a vulgar error that the\r\nHollanders furnished their enemies with powder and ammunition for their\r\nmoney, though engaged in a cruel war, but that they used to merchandise\r\nindifferently, and were permitted to sell to the friends of their\r\nenemies. He laughed at our Committee of Trade, as composed of men wholly\r\nignorant of it, and how they were the ruin of commerce, by gratifying\r\nsome for private ends.\r\n\r\n10th February, 1657. I went to visit the governor of Havannah, a brave,\r\nsober, valiant Spanish gentleman, taken by Captain Young, of Deptford,\r\nwhen, after twenty years being in the Indies, and amassing great wealth,\r\nhis lady and whole family, except two sons, were burned, destroyed, and\r\ntaken within sight of Spain, his eldest son, daughter, and wife,\r\nperishing with immense treasure. One son, of about seventeen years old,\r\nwith his brother of one year old, were the only ones saved. The young\r\ngentleman, about seventeen, was a well-complexioned youth, not\r\nolive-colored; he spoke Latin handsomely, was extremely well-bred, and\r\nborn in the Caraccas, 1,000 miles south of the equinoctial, near the\r\nmountains of Potosi; he had never been in Europe before. The Governor was\r\nan ancient gentleman of great courage, of the order of St. Jago, sorely\r\nwounded in his arm, and his ribs broken; he lost for his own share\r\n£100,000 sterling, which he seemed to bear with exceeding indifference,\r\nand nothing dejected. After some discourse, I went with them to Arundel\r\nHouse, where they dined. They were now going back into Spain, having\r\nobtained their liberty from Cromwell. An example of human vicissitude!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n14th February, 1657. To London, where I found Mrs. Cary; next day came Mr.\r\nMordaunt (since Viscount Mordaunt), younger son to the Countess of\r\nPeterborough, to see his mistress, bringing with him two of my Lord of\r\nDover's daughters: so, after dinner, they all departed.\r\n\r\n5th March, 1657. Dr. Rand, a learned physician, dedicated to me his\r\nversion of Gassendi's \"_Vita Peiriskii_.\"\r\n\r\n25th March, 1657. Dr. Taylor showed me his MS. of \"Cases of Conscience,\"\r\nor \"_Ductor Dubitantium_,\" now fitted for the press.\r\n\r\nThe Protector Oliver, now affecting kingship, is petitioned to take the\r\ntitle on him by all his newly-made sycophant lords, etc.; but dares not,\r\nfor fear of the fanatics, not thoroughly purged out of his rebel army.\r\n\r\n21st April, 1657. Came Sir Thomas Hanmer, of Hanmer, in Wales, to see me.\r\nI then waited on my Lord Hatton, with whom I dined: at my return, I\r\nstepped into Bedlam, where I saw several poor, miserable creatures in\r\nchains; one of them was mad with making verses. I also visited the\r\nCharter House, formerly belonging to the Carthusians, now an old, neat,\r\nfresh, solitary college for decayed gentlemen. It has a grove, bowling\r\ngreen, garden, chapel, and a hall where they eat in common. I likewise\r\nsaw Christ Church and Hospital, a very good Gothic building; the hall,\r\nschool, and lodgings in great order for bringing up many hundreds of poor\r\nchildren of both sexes; it is an exemplary charity. There is a large\r\npicture at one end of the hall, representing the governors, founders, and\r\nthe institution.\r\n\r\n25th April, 1657. I had a dangerous fall out of the coach in Covent\r\nGarden, going to my brother's, but without harm; the Lord be praised!\r\n\r\n1st May, 1657. Divers soldiers were quartered at my house; but I thank\r\nGod went away the next day toward Flanders.\r\n\r\n5th May, 1657. I went with my cousin, George Tuke, to see Baynard, in\r\nSurrey, a house of my brother Richard's, which he would have hired. This\r\nis a very fair, noble residence, built in a park, and having one of the\r\ngoodliest avenues of oaks up to it that ever I saw: there is a pond of 60\r\nacres near it; the windows of the chief rooms are of very fine painted\r\nglass. The situation is excessively dirty and melancholy.\r\n\r\n15th May, 1657. Lawrence, President of Oliver's Council, and some other\r\nof his Court-Lords, came in the afternoon to see my garden and\r\nplantations.\r\n\r\n7th June, 1657. My fourth son was born, christened George (after my\r\ngrandfather); Dr. Jeremy Taylor officiated in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n18th June, 1657. At Greenwich I saw a sort of cat[57] brought from the\r\nEast Indies, shaped and snouted much like the Egyptian racoon, in the\r\nbody like a monkey, and so footed; the ears and tail like a cat, only the\r\ntail much longer, and the skin variously ringed with black and white;\r\nwith the tail it wound up its body like a serpent, and so got up into\r\ntrees, and with it would wrap its whole body round. Its hair was woolly\r\nlike a lamb; it was exceedingly nimble, gentle, and purred as does the\r\ncat.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 57: This was probably the animal called a Mocock\r\n    (_maucaco_), since well known.]\r\n\r\n16th July, 1657. On Dr. Jeremy Taylor's recommendation, I went to Eltham,\r\nto help one Moody, a young man, to that living, by my interest with the\r\npatron.\r\n\r\n6th August, 1657. I went to see Colonel Blount, who showed me the\r\napplication of the waywiser[58] to a coach, exactly measuring the miles,\r\nand showing them by an index as we went on. It had three circles, one\r\npointing to the number of rods, another to the miles, by 10 to 1,000,\r\nwith all the subdivisions of quarters; very pretty and useful.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 58: Beckmann, in his \"History of Inventions,\" has written\r\n    an account of the different instruments applied to carriages to\r\n    measure the distance they pass over. He places the first\r\n    introduction of the _adometer_ in England at about the end of the\r\n    seventeenth century, instead of about the middle, and states it to\r\n    have been the invention of an ingenious artist named Butterfield.]\r\n\r\n10th August, 1657. Our vicar, from John xviii. 36, declaimed against the\r\nfolly of a sort of enthusiasts and desperate zealots, called the\r\nFIFTH-MONARCHY-MEN, pretending to set up the kingdom of Christ with the\r\nsword. To this pass was this age arrived when we had no King in Israel.\r\n\r\n21st August, 1657. Fell a most prodigious rain in London, and the year\r\nwas very sickly in the country.\r\n\r\n1st September, 1657. I visited Sir Edmund Bowyer, at his melancholy seat\r\nat Camberwell. He has a very pretty grove of oaks, and hedges of yew in\r\nhis garden, and a handsome row of tall elms before his court.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n15th September, 1657. Going to London with some company, we stepped in to\r\nsee a famous rope-dancer, called THE TURK. I saw even to astonishment the\r\nagility with which he performed. He walked barefooted, taking hold by his\r\ntoes only of a rope almost perpendicular, and without so much as touching\r\nit with his hands; he danced blind-fold on the high rope, and with a boy\r\nof twelve years old tied to one of his feet about twenty feet beneath\r\nhim, dangling as he danced, yet he moved as nimbly as if it had been but\r\na feather. Lastly, he stood on his head, on the top of a very high mast,\r\ndanced on a small rope that was very slack, and finally flew down the\r\nperpendicular, on his breast, his head foremost, his legs and arms\r\nextended, with divers other activities.--I saw the hairy woman, twenty\r\nyears old, whom I had before seen when a child. She was born at Augsburg,\r\nin Germany. Her very eyebrows were combed upward, and all her _forehead_\r\nas thick and even as grows on any woman's head, neatly dressed; a very\r\nlong lock of hair out of each ear; she had also a most prolix beard, and\r\n_moustachios_, with long locks growing on the middle of her nose, like an\r\nIceland dog exactly, the color of a bright brown, fine as well-dressed\r\nflax. She was now married, and told me she had one child that was not\r\nhairy, nor were any of her parents, or relations. She was very well\r\nshaped, and played well on the harpsichord.\r\n\r\n17th September, 1657. To see Sir Robert Needham, at Lambeth, a relation\r\nof mine; and thence to John Tradescant's museum, in which the chiefest\r\nrarities were, in my opinion, the ancient Roman, Indian, and other\r\nnations' armor, shields, and weapons; some habits of curiously-colored\r\nand wrought feathers, one from the phoenix wing, as tradition goes.\r\nOther innumerable things there were printed in his catalogue by Mr.\r\nAshmole, to whom after the death of the widow they are bequeathed, and by\r\nhim designed as a gift to Oxford.\r\n\r\n19th October, 1657. I went to see divers gardens about London: returning,\r\nI saw at Dr. Joyliffe's two Virginian rattlesnakes alive, exceeding a\r\nyard in length, small heads, slender tails, but in the middle nearly the\r\nsize of my leg; when vexed, swiftly vibrating and shaking their tails, as\r\nloud as a child's rattle; this, by the collision of certain gristly skins\r\ncuriously jointed, yet loose, and transparent as parchment, by which they\r\ngive warning; a providential caution for other creatures to avoid them.\r\nThe Doctor tried their biting on rats and mice, which they immediately\r\nkilled: but their vigor must needs be much exhausted here, in another\r\nclimate, and kept only in a barrel of bran.\r\n\r\n22d October, 1657. To town, to visit the Holland Ambassador, with whom I\r\nhad now contracted much friendly correspondence, useful to the\r\nintelligence I constantly gave his Majesty abroad.\r\n\r\n26th November, 1657. I went to London, to a court of the East India\r\nCompany on its new union, in Merchant-Taylors' Hall, where was much\r\ndisorder by reason of the Anabaptists, who would have the adventurers\r\nobliged only by an engagement, without swearing, that they still might\r\npursue their private trade; but it was carried against them. Wednesday\r\nwas fixed on for a general court for election of officers, after a sermon\r\nand prayers for good success. The Stock resolved on was £800,000.\r\n\r\n27th November, 1657. I took the oath at the East India House, subscribing\r\n£500.\r\n\r\n2d December, 1657. Dr. Raynolds (since Bishop of Norwich) preached before\r\nthe company at St. Andrew Under-shaft, on Nehemiah xiii. 31, showing, by\r\nthe example of Nehemiah, all the perfections of a trusty person in\r\npublic affairs, with many good precepts apposite to the occasion, ending\r\nwith a prayer for God's blessing on the company and the undertaking.\r\n\r\n3d December, 1657. Mr. Gunning preached on John iii. 3, against the\r\nAnabaptists, showing the effect and necessity of the sacrament of\r\nbaptism. This sect was now wonderfully spread.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n25th December, 1657. I went to London with my wife, to celebrate\r\nChristmas-day, Mr. Gunning preaching in Exeter chapel, on Micah vii. 2.\r\nSermon ended, as he was giving us the Holy Sacrament, the chapel was\r\nsurrounded with soldiers, and all the communicants and assembly surprised\r\nand kept prisoners by them, some in the house, others carried away. It\r\nfell to my share to be confined to a room in the house, where yet I was\r\npermitted to dine with the master of it, the Countess of Dorset, Lady\r\nHatton, and some others of quality who invited me. In the afternoon, came\r\nColonel Whalley, Goffe, and others, from Whitehall, to examine us one by\r\none; some they committed to the marshal, some to prison. When I came\r\nbefore them, they took my name and abode, examined me why, contrary to\r\nthe ordinance made, that none should any longer observe the superstitious\r\ntime of the nativity (so esteemed by them), I durst offend, and\r\nparticularly be at common prayers, which they told me was but the mass in\r\nEnglish, and particularly pray for Charles Stuart; for which we had no\r\nScripture. I told them we did not pray for Charles Stuart, but for all\r\nChristian kings, princes, and governors. They replied, in so doing we\r\nprayed for the king of Spain, too, who was their enemy and a Papist, with\r\nother frivolous and ensnaring questions, and much threatening; and,\r\nfinding no color to detain me, they dismissed me with much pity of my\r\nignorance. These were men of high flight and above ordinances, and spoke\r\nspiteful things of our Lord's nativity. As we went up to receive the\r\nSacrament, the miscreants held their muskets against us, as if they would\r\nhave shot us at the altar; but yet suffering us to finish the office of\r\nCommunion, as perhaps not having instructions what to do, in case they\r\nfound us in that action. So I got home late the next day; blessed be God!\r\n\r\n27th January, 1657-58. After six fits of a quartan ague, with which it\r\npleased God to visit him, died my dear son, Richard, to our\r\ninexpressible grief and affliction, five years and three days old only,\r\nbut at that tender age a prodigy for wit and understanding; for beauty of\r\nbody, a very angel; for endowment of mind, of incredible and rare hopes.\r\nTo give only a little taste of them, and thereby glory to God, who \"out\r\nof the mouths of babes and infants does sometimes perfect his praises,\"\r\nhe had learned all his catechism; at two years and a half old, he could\r\nperfectly read any of the English, Latin, French, or Gothic letters,\r\npronouncing the first three languages exactly. He had, before the fifth\r\nyear, or in that year, not only skill to read most written hands, but to\r\ndecline all the nouns, conjugate the verbs regular, and most of the\r\nirregular; learned out \"Puerilis,\" got by heart almost the entire\r\nvocabulary of Latin and French primitives and words, could make congruous\r\nsyntax, turn English into Latin, and _vice versâ_, construe and prove\r\nwhat he read, and did the government and use of relatives, verbs,\r\nsubstantives, ellipses, and many figures and tropes, and made a\r\nconsiderable progress in Comenius's \"_Janua_\"; began himself to write\r\nlegibly, and had a strong passion for Greek. The number of verses he\r\ncould recite was prodigious, and what he remembered of the parts of\r\nplays, which he would also act; and, when seeing a Plautus in one's hand,\r\nhe asked what book it was, and, being told it was comedy, and too\r\ndifficult for him, he wept for sorrow. Strange was his apt and ingenious\r\napplication of fables and morals; for he had read Æsop; he had a\r\nwonderful disposition to mathematics, having by heart divers propositions\r\nof Euclid that were read to him in play, and he would make lines and\r\ndemonstrate them. As to his piety, astonishing were his applications of\r\nScripture upon occasion, and his sense of God; he had learned all his\r\ncatechism early, and understood the historical part of the Bible and New\r\nTestament to a wonder, how Christ came to redeem mankind, and how,\r\ncomprehending these necessaries himself, his godfathers were discharged\r\nof their promise.\r\n\r\nThese and the like illuminations, far exceeding his age and experience,\r\nconsidering the prettiness of his address and behavior, cannot but leave\r\nimpressions in me at the memory of him. When one told him how many days a\r\nQuaker had fasted, he replied that was no wonder; for Christ had said\r\nthat man should not live by bread alone, but by the Word of God. He would\r\nof himself select the most pathetic psalms, and chapters out of Job, to\r\nread to his maid during his sickness, telling her, when she pitied him,\r\nthat all God's children must suffer affliction. He declaimed against the\r\nvanities of the world, before he had seen any. Often he would desire\r\nthose who came to see him to pray by him, and a year before he fell sick,\r\nto kneel and pray with him alone in some corner. How thankfully would he\r\nreceive admonition! how soon be reconciled! how indifferent, yet\r\ncontinually cheerful! He would give grave advice to his brother, John,\r\nbear with his impertinences, and say he was but a child. If he heard of\r\nor saw any new thing, he was unquiet till he was told how it was made; he\r\nbrought to us all such difficulties as he found in books, to be\r\nexpounded. He had learned by heart divers sentences in Latin and Greek,\r\nwhich, on occasion, he would produce even to wonder. He was all life, all\r\nprettiness, far from morose, sullen, or childish in anything he said or\r\ndid. The last time he had been at church (which was at Greenwich), I\r\nasked him, according to custom, what he remembered of the sermon; two\r\ngood things, Father, said he, _bonum gratiæ_ and _bonum gloriæ_, with a\r\njust account of what the preacher said.\r\n\r\nThe day before he died, he called to me: and in a more serious manner\r\nthan usual, told me that for all I loved him so dearly I should give my\r\nhouse, land, and all my fine things to his brother Jack, he should have\r\nnone of them; and, the next morning, when he found himself ill, and that\r\nI persuaded him to keep his hands in bed, he demanded whether he might\r\npray to God with his hands unjoined; and a little after, while in great\r\nagony, whether he should not offend God by using his holy name so often\r\ncalling for ease. What shall I say of his frequent pathetical\r\nejaculations uttered of himself: \"Sweet Jesus, save me, deliver me,\r\npardon my sins, let thine angels receive me!\" So early knowledge, so much\r\npiety and perfection! But thus God, having dressed up a saint fit for\r\nhimself, would not longer permit him with us, unworthy of the future\r\nfruits of this incomparable hopeful blossom. Such a Child I never saw:\r\nfor such a child I bless God, in whose bosom he is! May I and mine\r\nbecome as this little child, who now follows the child Jesus that Lamb of\r\nGod in a white robe, whithersoever he goes; even so, Lord Jesus, _fiat\r\nvoluntas tua_! Thou gavest him to us, thou hast taken him from us,\r\nblessed be the name of the Lord! That I had anything acceptable to thee\r\nwas from thy grace alone, seeing from me he had nothing but sin, but that\r\nthou hast pardoned! blessed be my God for ever, Amen.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, he was suffocated by the women and maids that attended\r\nhim, and covered him too hot with blankets as he lay in a cradle, near an\r\nexcessive hot fire in a close room. I suffered him to be opened, when\r\nthey found that he was what is vulgarly called liver-grown. I caused his\r\nbody to be coffined in lead, and deposited on the 30th at eight o'clock\r\nthat night in the church at Deptford, accompanied with divers of my\r\nrelations and neighbors, among whom I distributed rings with this motto:\r\n\"_Dominus abstulit_;\" intending, God willing, to have him transported\r\nwith my own body to be interred in our dormitory in Wotton Church, in my\r\ndear native county of Surrey, and to lay my bones and mingle my dust with\r\nmy fathers, if God be gracious to me, and make me as fit for him as this\r\nblessed child was. The Lord Jesus sanctify this and all other my\r\nafflictions, Amen.\r\n\r\nHere ends the joy of my life, and for which I go even mourning to the\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n15th February, 1658. The afflicting hand of God being still upon us, it\r\npleased him also to take away from us this morning my youngest son,\r\nGeorge, now seven weeks languishing at nurse, breeding teeth, and ending\r\nin a dropsy. God's holy will be done! He was buried in Deptford Church,\r\nthe 17th following.\r\n\r\n25th February, 1658. Came Dr. Jeremy Taylor, and my brothers, with other\r\nfriends, to visit and condole with us.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n7th March, 1658. To London, to hear Dr. Taylor in a private house on Luke\r\nxiii. 23, 24. After the sermon, followed the blessed Communion, of which\r\nI participated. In the afternoon, Dr. Gunning, at Exeter House,\r\nexpounding part of the Creed.\r\n\r\nThis had been the severest winter that any man alive had known in\r\nEngland. The crows' feet were frozen to their prey. Islands of ice\r\ninclosed both fish and fowl frozen, and some persons in their boats.\r\n\r\n15th May, 1658, was a public fast, to avert an epidemical sickness, very\r\nmortal this spring.\r\n\r\n20th May, 1658. I went to see a coach race in Hyde Park, and collationed\r\nin Spring Garden.\r\n\r\n23d May, 1658. Dr. Manton, the famous Presbyterian, preached at Covent\r\nGarden, on Matthew vi. 10, showing what the kingdom of God was, how pray\r\nfor it, etc.\r\n\r\nThere was now a collection for persecuted and sequestered Ministers of\r\nthe Church of England, whereof divers are in prison. A sad day! The\r\nChurch now in dens and caves of the earth.\r\n\r\n31st May, 1658. I went to visit my Lady Peterborough, whose son, Mr.\r\nMordaunt, prisoner in the Tower, was now on his trial, and acquitted but\r\nby one voice; but that holy martyr, Dr. Hewer, was condemned to die\r\nwithout law, jury, or justice, but by a mock Council of State, as they\r\ncalled it. A dangerous, treacherous time!\r\n\r\n2d June, 1658. An extraordinary storm of hail and rain, the season as\r\ncold as winter, the wind northerly near six months.\r\n\r\n3d June, 1658. A large whale was taken between my land abutting on the\r\nThames and Greenwich, which drew an infinite concourse to see it, by\r\nwater, horse, coach, and on foot, from London, and all parts. It appeared\r\nfirst below Greenwich at low water, for at high water it would have\r\ndestroyed all the boats, but lying now in shallow water encompassed with\r\nboats, after a long conflict, it was killed with a harping iron, struck\r\nin the head, out of which spouted blood and water by two tunnels; and\r\nafter a horrid groan, it ran quite on shore, and died. Its length was\r\nfifty-eight feet, height sixteen; black skinned, like coach leather; very\r\nsmall eyes, great tail, only two small fins, a peaked snout and a mouth\r\nso wide, that divers men might have stood upright in it; no teeth, but\r\nsucked the slime only as through a grate of that bone which we call\r\nwhalebone; the throat yet so narrow, as would not have admitted the least\r\nof fishes. The extremes of the cetaceous bones hang downward from the\r\nupper jaw, and are hairy toward the ends and bottom within side: all of\r\nit prodigious; but in nothing more wonderful than that an animal of so\r\ngreat a bulk should be nourished only by slime through those grates.\r\n\r\n8th June, 1658. That excellent preacher and holy man, Dr. Hewer, was\r\nmartyred for having intelligence with his Majesty, through the Lord\r\nMarquis of Ormond.\r\n\r\n9th June, 1658. I went to see the Earl of Northumberland's pictures,\r\nwhereof that of the Venetian Senators was one of the best of Titian's and\r\nanother of Andrea del Sarto, viz, a Madonna, Christ, St. John, and an Old\r\nWoman; a St. Catherine of Da Vinci, with divers portraits of Vandyck; a\r\nNativity of Georgioni; the last of our blessed Kings (Charles I.), and\r\nthe Duke of York, by Lely, a Rosary by the famous Jesuits of Brussels,\r\nand several more. This was in Suffolk House: the new front toward the\r\ngardens is tolerable, were it not drowned by a too massy and clumsy pair\r\nof stairs of stone, without any neat invention.\r\n\r\n10th June, 1658. I went to see the Medical Garden at Westminster, well\r\nstored with plants, under Morgan, a very skillful botanist.\r\n\r\n26th June, 1658. To Eltham, to visit honest Mr. Owen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n3d July, 1658. To London, and dined with Mr. Henshaw, Mr. Dorell, and Mr.\r\nAshmole, founder of the Oxford repository of rarities, with divers\r\ndoctors of physic and virtuosos.\r\n\r\n15th July, 1658. Came to see my Lord Kilmurry and Lady, Sir Robert\r\nNeedham, Mr. Offley, and two daughters of my Lord Willoughby, of Parham.\r\n\r\n3d August, 1658. Went to Sir John Evelyn at Godstone. The place is\r\nexcellent, but might be improved by turning some offices of the house,\r\nand removing the garden. The house being a noble fabric, though not\r\ncomparable to what was first built by my uncle, who was master of all the\r\npowder mills.\r\n\r\n5th August, 1658. We went to Squirries to visit my Cousin Leech, daughter\r\nto Sir John; a pretty, finely wooded, well watered seat, the stables\r\ngood, the house old, but convenient. 6th. Returned to Wotton.\r\n\r\n10th August, 1658. I dined at Mr. Carew Raleigh's, at Horsley, son to the\r\nfamous Sir Walter.\r\n\r\n14th August, 1658. We went to Durdans [at Epsom] to a challenged match at\r\nbowls for £10, which we won.\r\n\r\n18th August, 1658. To Sir Ambrose Browne, at Betchworth Castle, in that\r\ntempestuous wind which threw down my greatest trees at Sayes Court, and\r\ndid so much mischief all over England. It continued the whole night;\r\nand, till three in the afternoon of the next day, in the southwest, and\r\ndestroyed all our winter fruit.\r\n\r\n3d September, 1658. Died that arch-rebel, Oliver Cromwell, called\r\nProtector.\r\n\r\n16th September, 1658. Was published my translation of St. Chrysostom on\r\n\"Education of Children,\" which I dedicated to both my brothers to comfort\r\nthem on the loss of their children.\r\n\r\n21st September, 1658. My Lord Berkeley, of Berkeley Castle, invited me to\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n26th September, 1658. Mr. King preached at Ashted, on Proverbs xv. 24; a\r\nQuaker would have disputed with him. In the afternoon, we heard Dr.\r\nHacket (since Bishop of Litchfield) at Cheam, where the family of the\r\nLumleys lie buried.\r\n\r\n27th September, 1658. To Beddington, that ancient seat of the Carews, a\r\nfine old hall, but a scambling house, famous for the first orange garden\r\nin England, being now overgrown trees, planted in the ground, and secured\r\nin winter with a wooden tabernacle and stoves. This seat is rarely\r\nwatered, lying low, and environed with good pastures. The pomegranates\r\nbear here. To the house is also added a fine park. Thence, to Carshalton,\r\nexcellently watered, and capable of being made a most delicious seat,\r\nbeing on the sweet downs, and a champaign about it full planted with\r\nwalnut and cherry trees, which afford a considerable rent.\r\n\r\nRiding over these downs, and discoursing with the shepherds, I found that\r\ndigging about the bottom near Sir Christopher Buckle's,[59] near\r\nBanstead, divers medals have been found, both copper and silver, with\r\nfoundations of houses, urns, etc. Here, indeed, anciently stood a city of\r\nthe Romans. See Antonine's \"Itineraries.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 59: Not far from the course of the Roman Road from\r\n    Chichester, through Sussex, passing through Ockley, and Dorking\r\n    churchyard. Considerable remains of a Roman building have since been\r\n    found on Waltonheath, south of this house.]\r\n\r\n29th September, 1658. I returned home, after a ten weeks' absence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n2d October, 1658. I went to London, to receive the Holy Sacrament.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d, Dr. Wild preached in a private place on Isaiah i. 4, showing\r\nthe parallel between the sins of Israel and those of England. In the\r\nafternoon, Mr. Hall (son to Joseph, Bishop of Norwich) on 1 Cor. vi. 2,\r\nof the dignity of the Saints; a most excellent discourse.\r\n\r\n4th October, 1658. I dined with the Holland ambassador, at Derby House:\r\nreturning, I diverted to see a very WHITE RAVEN, bred in Cumberland; also\r\na porcupine, of that kind that shoots its quills, of which see Claudian;\r\nit was headed like a rat, the fore feet like a badger, the hind feet like\r\na bear.\r\n\r\n19th October, 1658. I was summoned to London, by the commissioners for\r\nnew buildings; afterward, to the commission of sewers; but because there\r\nwas an oath to be taken of fidelity to the Government as now constituted\r\nwithout a king, I got to be excused, and returned home.\r\n\r\n22d October, 1658. Saw the superb funeral of the protector. He was\r\ncarried from Somerset House in a velvet bed of state, drawn by six\r\nhorses, housed with the same; the pall held by his new lords; Oliver\r\nlying in effigy, in royal robes, and crowned with a crown, sceptre, and\r\nglobe, like a king. The pendants and guidons were carried by the officers\r\nof the army; the imperial banners, achievements, etc., by the heralds in\r\ntheir coats; a rich caparisoned horse, embroidered all over with gold; a\r\nknight of honor, armed _cap-a-pie_, and, after all, his guards, soldiers,\r\nand innumerable mourners. In this equipage, they proceeded to\r\nWestminster: but it was the most joyful funeral I ever saw; for there\r\nwere none that cried but dogs, which the soldiers hooted away with a\r\nbarbarous noise, drinking and taking tobacco in the streets as they went.\r\n\r\nI returned not home till the 17th of November.\r\n\r\nI was summoned again to London by the commissioners for new foundations\r\nto be erected within such a distance of London.\r\n\r\n6th December, 1658. Now was published my \"French Gardener,\" the first and\r\nbest of the kind that introduced the use of the olitory garden to any\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n23d December, 1658. I went with my wife to keep Christmas at my cousin,\r\nGeorge Tuke's, at Cressing Temple, in Essex. Lay that night at Brentwood.\r\n\r\n25th December, 1658. Here was no public service, but what we privately\r\nused. I blessed God for his mercies the year past; and 1st of January,\r\nbegged a continuance of them. Thus, for three Sundays, by reason of the\r\nincumbent's death, here was neither praying nor preaching, though there\r\nwas a chapel in the house.\r\n\r\n17th January, 1659. Our old vicar preached, taking leave of the parish in\r\na pathetical speech, to go to a living in the city.\r\n\r\n24th March, 1659. I went to London, to speak to the patron, Alderman\r\nCuttler, about presenting a fit pastor for our destitute parish church.\r\n\r\n5th April, 1659. Came the Earl of Northampton and the famous painter, Mr.\r\nWright, to visit me.\r\n\r\n10th April, 1659. One Mr. Littler, being now presented to the living of\r\nour parish, preached on John vi. 55, a sermon preparatory to the Holy\r\nSacrament.\r\n\r\n25th April, 1659. A wonderful and sudden change in the face of the\r\npublic; the new protector, Richard, slighted; several pretenders and\r\nparties strive for the government: all anarchy and confusion; Lord have\r\nmercy on us!\r\n\r\n5th May, 1659. I went to visit my brother in London; and next day, to see\r\na new opera, after the Italian way, in recitative music and scenes, much\r\ninferior to the Italian composure and magnificence; but it was prodigious\r\nthat in a time of such public consternation such a vanity should be kept\r\nup, or permitted. I, being engaged with company, could not decently\r\nresist the going to see it, though my heart smote me for it.\r\n\r\n7th May, 1659. Came the Ambassador of Holland and his lady to visit me,\r\nand stayed the whole afternoon.\r\n\r\n12th May, 1659. I returned the visit, discoursing much of the\r\nrevolutions, etc.\r\n\r\n19th May, 1659. Came to dine with me my Lord Galloway and his son, a\r\nScotch Lord and learned: also my brother and his lady, Lord Berkeley and\r\nhis lady, Mrs. Shirley, and the famous singer, Mrs. Knight,[60] and other\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 60: Afterward one of Charles II.'s mistresses.]\r\n\r\n23d May, 1659. I went to Rookwood, and dined with Sir William Hicks,\r\nwhere was a great feast and much company. It is a melancholy old house,\r\nenvironed with trees and rooks.\r\n\r\n26th May, 1659. Came to see me my Lord George Berkeley, Sir William\r\nDucie, and Sir George Pott's son of Norfolk.\r\n\r\n29th May, 1659. The nation was now in extreme confusion and unsettled,\r\nbetween the Armies and the Sectaries, the poor Church of England\r\nbreathing as it were her last; so sad a face of things had overspread us.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n7th June, 1659. To London, to take leave of my brother, and see the\r\nfoundations now laying for a long street and buildings in Hatton Garden,\r\ndesigned for a little town, lately an ample garden.\r\n\r\n1st September, 1659. I communicated to Mr. Robert Boyle, son to the Earl\r\nof Cork, my proposal for erecting a philosophic and mathematic college.\r\n\r\n15th September, 1659. Came to see me Mr. Brereton,[61] a very learned\r\ngentleman, son to my Lord Brereton, with his and divers other ladies.\r\nAlso, Henry Howard of Norfolk, since Duke of Norfolk.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 61: William, afterward third Lord Brereton; an\r\n    accomplished and able man, who assisted Evelyn in establishing the\r\n    Royal Society. He died in 1679.]\r\n\r\n30th September, 1659. I went to visit Sir William Ducie and Colonel\r\nBlount, where I met Sir Henry Blount, the famous traveler and water\r\ndrinker.\r\n\r\n10th October, 1659. I came with my wife and family to London: took\r\nlodgings at the Three Feathers, in Russell Street, Covent Garden, for the\r\nwinter, my son being very unwell.\r\n\r\n11th October, 1659. Came to visit me Mr. William Coventry (since\r\nsecretary to the Duke), son to the Lord Keeper, a wise and witty\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nThe Army now turned out the Parliament. We had now no government in the\r\nnation: all in confusion; no magistrate either owned or pretended; but\r\nthe soldiers, and they not agreed. God Almighty have mercy on us, and\r\nsettle us!\r\n\r\n17th October, 1659. I visited Mr. Howard, at Arundel House, who gave me a\r\nfair onyx set in gold, and showed me his design of a palace there.\r\n\r\n21st October, 1659. A private fast was kept by the Church of England\r\nProtestants in town, to beg of God the removal of his judgments, with\r\ndevout prayers for his mercy to our calamitous Church.\r\n\r\n7th November, 1659. Was published my bold \"Apology for the King\" in this\r\ntime of danger, when it was capital to speak or write in favor of him. It\r\nwas twice printed; so universally it took.\r\n\r\n9th November, 1659. We observed our solemn Fast for the calamity of our\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n12th November, 1659. I went to see the several drugs for the confection\r\nof treacle, dioscordium, and other electuaries, which an ingenious\r\napothecary had not only prepared and ranged on a large and very long\r\ntable, but covered every ingredient with a sheet of paper, on which was\r\nvery lively painted the thing in miniature, well to the life, were it\r\nplant, flower, animal, or other exotic drug.\r\n\r\n15th November, 1659. Dined with the Dutch Ambassador. He did in a manner\r\nacknowledge that his nation mind only their own profit, do nothing out of\r\ngratitude, but collaterally as it relates to their gain, or security; and\r\ntherefore the English were to look for nothing of assistance to the\r\nbanished King. This was to me no very grateful discourse, though an\r\ningenuous confession.\r\n\r\n18th November, 1659. Mr. Gunning celebrated the wonted Fast, and preached\r\non Phil. ii. 12, 13.\r\n\r\n24th November, 1659. Sir John Evelyn [of Godstone] invited us to the\r\nforty-first wedding-day feast, where was much company of friends.\r\n\r\n26th November, 1659. I was introduced into the acquaintance of divers\r\nlearned and worthy persons, Sir John Marsham, Mr. Dugdale, Mr. Stanley,\r\nand others.\r\n\r\n9th December, 1659. I supped with Mr. Gunning, it being our fast day, Dr.\r\nFearne, Mr. Thrisco, Mr. Chamberlain, Dr. Henchman, Dr. Wild, and other\r\ndevout and learned divines, firm confessors, and excellent persons. Note:\r\nMost of them since made bishops.\r\n\r\n10th December, 1659. I treated privately with Colonel Morley, then\r\nLieutenant of the Tower, and in great trust and power, concerning\r\ndelivering it to the King, and the bringing of him in, to the great\r\nhazard of my life, but the Colonel had been my schoolfellow, and I knew\r\nwould not betray me.\r\n\r\n12th December, 1659. I spent in public concerns for his Majesty, pursuing\r\nthe point to bring over Colonel Morley, and his brother-in-law, Fay,\r\nGovernor of Portsmouth.\r\n\r\n18th December, 1659. Preached that famous divine, Dr. Sanderson (since\r\nBishop of Lincoln), now eighty years old, on Jer. xxx. 13, concerning the\r\nevil of forsaking God.\r\n\r\n29th December, 1659. Came my Lord Count Arundel, of Wardour, to visit me.\r\nI went also to see my Lord Viscount Montague.\r\n\r\n31st December, 1659. Settling my domestic affairs in order, blessed God\r\nfor his infinite mercies and preservations the past year.\r\n\r\nANNUS MIRABILIS, January 1st, 1659-60. Begging God's blessings for the\r\nfollowing year, I went to Exeter Chapel, when Mr. Gunning began the year\r\non Galatians iv. 3-7, showing the love of Christ in shedding his blood so\r\nearly for us.\r\n\r\n12th January, 1660. Wrote to Colonel Morley again to declare for his\r\nMajesty.\r\n\r\n22d January, 1660. I went this afternoon to visit Colonel Morley. After\r\ndinner I discoursed with him; but he was very jealous, and would not\r\nbelieve that Monk came in to do the King any service; I told him that he\r\nmight do it without him, and have all the honor. He was still doubtful,\r\nand would resolve on nothing yet, so I took leave.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n3d February, 1660. Kept the Fast. General Monk came now to London out of\r\nScotland; but no man knew what he would do or declare; yet he was met on\r\nhis way by the gentlemen of all the counties which he passed with\r\npetitions that he would recall the old long-interrupted Parliament, and\r\nsettle the nation in some order, being at this time in most prodigious\r\nconfusion, and under no government, everybody expecting what would be\r\nnext and what he would do.\r\n\r\n10th February, 1660. Now were the gates of the city broken down by\r\nGeneral Monk; which exceedingly exasperated the city, the soldiers\r\nmarching up and down as triumphing over it, and all the old army of the\r\nfanatics put out of their posts and sent out of town.\r\n\r\n11th February, 1660. A signal day. Monk, perceiving how infamous and\r\nwretched a pack of knaves would have still usurped the supreme power, and\r\nhaving intelligence that they intended to take away his commission,\r\nrepenting of what he had done to the city, and where he and his forces\r\nwere quartered, marches to Whitehall, dissipates that nest of robbers,\r\nand convenes the old Parliament, the Rump Parliament (so called as\r\nretaining some few rotten members of the other) being dissolved; and for\r\njoy whereof were many thousands of rumps roasted publicly in the streets\r\nat the bonfires this night, with ringing of bells, and universal jubilee.\r\nThis was the first good omen.\r\n\r\nFrom 17th February to 5th April, I was detained in bed with a kind of\r\ndouble tertian, the cruel effects of the spleen and other distempers, in\r\nthat extremity that my physicians, Drs. Wetherborn, Needham, and Claude,\r\nwere in great doubt of my recovery; but it pleased God to deliver me out\r\nof this affliction, for which I render him hearty thanks: going to church\r\nthe 8th, and receiving the blessed eucharist.\r\n\r\nDuring this sickness came divers of my relations and friends to visit me,\r\nand it retarded my going into the country longer than I intended;\r\nhowever, I wrote and printed a letter in defense of his Majesty,[62]\r\nagainst a wicked forged paper, pretended to be sent from Brussels to\r\ndefame his Majesty's person and virtues and render him odious, now when\r\neverybody was in hope and expectation of the General and Parliament\r\nrecalling him, and establishing the Government on its ancient and right\r\nbasis. The doing this toward the decline of my sickness, and sitting up\r\nlong in my bed, had caused a small relapse, out of which it yet pleased\r\nGod also to free me, so as by the 14th I was able to go into the country,\r\nwhich I did to my sweet and native air at Wotton.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 62: With the title of \"The Late News, or Message from\r\n    Brussels Unmasked.\" This, and the pamphlet which gave rise to it,\r\n    are reprinted in \"Evelyn's Miscellaneous Writings.\"]\r\n\r\n3d May, 1660. Came the most happy tidings of his Majesty's gracious\r\ndeclaration and applications to the Parliament, General, and people, and\r\ntheir dutiful acceptance and acknowledgment, after a most bloody and\r\nunreasonable rebellion of near twenty years. Praised be forever the Lord\r\nof Heaven, who only doeth wondrous things, because his mercy endureth\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n8th May, 1660. This day was his Majesty proclaimed in London, etc.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n9th May, 1660. I was desired and designed to accompany my Lord Berkeley\r\nwith the public address of the Parliament, General, etc., to the King,\r\nand invite him to come over and assume his Kingly Government, he being\r\nnow at Breda; but I was yet so weak, I could not make that journey by\r\nsea, which was not a little to my detriment, so I went to London to\r\nexcuse myself, returning the 10th, having yet received a gracious message\r\nfrom his Majesty by Major Scot and Colonel Tuke.\r\n\r\n24th May, 1660. Came to me Colonel Morley, about procuring his pardon,\r\nnow too late, seeing his error and neglect of the counsel I gave him, by\r\nwhich, if he had taken it he had certainly done the great work with the\r\nsame ease that Monk did it, who was then in Scotland, and Morley in a\r\npost to have done what he pleased, but his jealousy and fear kept him\r\nfrom that blessing and honor. I addressed him to Lord Mordaunt, then in\r\ngreat favor, for his pardon, which he obtained at the cost of £1,000, as\r\nI heard. Oh, the sottish omission of this gentleman! what did I not\r\nundergo of danger in this negotiation, to have brought him over to his\r\nMajesty's interest, when it was entirely in his hands!\r\n\r\n29th May, 1660. This day, his Majesty, Charles II. came to London, after\r\na sad and long exile and calamitous suffering both of the King and\r\nChurch, being seventeen years. This was also his birthday, and with a\r\ntriumph of above 20,000 horse and foot, brandishing their swords, and\r\nshouting with inexpressible joy; the ways strewn with flowers, the bells\r\nringing, the streets hung with tapestry, fountains running with wine; the\r\nMayor, Aldermen, and all the companies, in their liveries, chains of\r\ngold, and banners; Lords and Nobles, clad in cloth of silver, gold, and\r\nvelvet; the windows and balconies, all set with ladies; trumpets, music,\r\nand myriads of people flocking, even so far as from Rochester, so as they\r\nwere seven hours in passing the city, even from two in the afternoon till\r\nnine at night.\r\n\r\nI stood in the Strand and beheld it, and blessed God. And all this was\r\ndone without one drop of blood shed, and by that very army which rebelled\r\nagainst him: but it was the Lord's doing, for such a restoration was\r\nnever mentioned in any history, ancient or modern, since the return of\r\nthe Jews from their Babylonish captivity; nor so joyful a day and so\r\nbright ever seen in this nation, this happening when to expect or effect\r\nit was past all human policy.\r\n\r\n4th June, 1660. I received letters of Sir Richard Browne's landing at\r\nDover, and also letters from the Queen, which I was to deliver at\r\nWhitehall, not as yet presenting myself to his Majesty, by reason of the\r\ninfinite concourse of people. The eagerness of men, women, and children,\r\nto see his Majesty, and kiss his hands, was so great, that he had scarce\r\nleisure to eat for some days, coming as they did from all parts of the\r\nnation; and the King being as willing to give them that satisfaction,\r\nwould have none kept out, but gave free access to all sorts of people.\r\n\r\nAddressing myself to the Duke, I was carried to his Majesty, when very\r\nfew noblemen were with him, and kissed his hands, being very graciously\r\nreceived. I then returned home, to meet Sir Richard Browne, who came not\r\ntill the 8th, after nineteen years exile, during all which time he kept\r\nup in his chapel the Liturgy and Offices of the Church of England, to his\r\nno small honor, and in a time when it was so low, and as many thought\r\nutterly lost, that in various controversies both with Papists and\r\nSectaries, our divines used to argue for the visibility of the Church,\r\nfrom his chapel and congregation.\r\n\r\nI was all this week to and fro at court about business.\r\n\r\n16th June, 1660. The French, Italian, and Dutch Ministers came to make\r\ntheir address to his Majesty, one Monsieur Stoope pronouncing the\r\nharangue with great eloquence.\r\n\r\n18th June, 1660. I proposed the embassy to Constantinople for Mr.\r\nHenshaw; but my Lord Winchelsea struck in.\r\n\r\nGoods that had been pillaged from Whitehall during the Rebellion were now\r\ndaily brought in, and restored upon proclamation; as plate, hangings,\r\npictures, etc.\r\n\r\n22d June, 1660. The Warwickshire gentlemen (as did all the shires and\r\nchief towns in all the three nations) presented their congratulatory\r\naddress. It was carried by my Lord Northampton.\r\n\r\n30th June, 1660. The Sussex gentlemen presented their address, to which\r\nwas my hand. I went with it, and kissed his Majesty's hand, who was\r\npleased to own me more particularly by calling me his old acquaintance,\r\nand speaking very graciously to me.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n3d July, 1660. I went to Hyde Park, where was his Majesty, and abundance\r\nof gallantry.\r\n\r\n4th July, 1660. I heard Sir Samuel Tuke harangue to the House of Lords,\r\nin behalf of the Roman Catholics, and his account of the transaction at\r\nColchester in murdering Lord Capel, and the rest of those brave men, that\r\nsuffered in cold blood, after articles of rendition.\r\n\r\n5th July, 1660. I saw his Majesty go with as much pomp and splendor as\r\nany earthly prince could do to the great city feast, the first they had\r\ninvited him to since his return; but the exceeding rain which fell all\r\nthat day much eclipsed its lustres. This was at Guildhall, and there was\r\nalso all the Parliament men, both Lords and Commons. The streets were\r\nadorned with pageants, at immense cost.\r\n\r\n6th July, 1660. His Majesty began first to TOUCH FOR THE EVIL! according\r\nto custom, thus: his Majesty sitting under his state in the banqueting\r\nhouse, the chirurgeons cause the sick to be brought, or led, up to the\r\nthrone, where they kneeling, the King strokes their faces, or cheeks with\r\nboth his hands at once, at which instant a chaplain in his formalities\r\nsays, \"He put his hands upon them, and he healed them.\" This is said to\r\nevery one in particular. When they have all been touched, they come up\r\nagain in the same order, and the other chaplain kneeling, and having\r\nangel gold[63] strung on white ribbon on his arm, delivers them one by\r\none to his Majesty, who puts them about the necks of the touched as they\r\npass, while the first chaplain repeats, \"That is the true light who came\r\ninto the world.\" Then follows, an Epistle (as at first a Gospel) with the\r\nLiturgy, prayers for the sick, with some alteration; lastly the blessing;\r\nand then the Lord Chamberlain and the Comptroller of the Household bring\r\na basin, ewer, and towel, for his Majesty to wash.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 63: Pieces of money, so called from the figure of an angel\r\n    on them.]\r\n\r\nThe King received a congratulatory address from the city of Cologne, in\r\nGermany, where he had been some time in his exile; his Majesty saying\r\nthey were the best people in the world, the most kind and worthy to him\r\nthat he ever met with. I recommended Monsieur Messary to be Judge\r\nAdvocate in Jersey, by the Vice-Chamberlain's mediation with the Earl of\r\nSt. Albans; and saluted my excellent and worthy noble friend, my Lord\r\nOssory, son to the Marquis of Ormond, after many years' absence returned\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n8th July, 1660. Mr. Henchman preached on Ephes. v. 5, concerning\r\nChristian circumspection. From henceforth, was the Liturgy publicly used\r\nin our churches, whence it had been for so many years banished.\r\n\r\n15th July, 1660. Came Sir George Carteret and lady to visit us: he was\r\nnow Treasurer of the Navy.\r\n\r\n28th July, 1660. I heard his Majesty's speech in the Lords' House, on\r\npassing the Bills of Tonnage and Poundage; restoration of my Lord Ormond\r\nto his estate in Ireland; concerning the commission of sewers, and\r\ncontinuance of the excise. In the afternoon I saluted my old friend, the\r\nArchbishop of Armagh, formerly of Londonderry (Dr. Bramhall). He\r\npresented several Irish divines to be promoted as Bishops in that\r\nkingdom, most of the Bishops in the three kingdoms being now almost worn\r\nout, and the Sees vacant.\r\n\r\n31st July, 1660. I went to visit Sir Philip Warwick, now secretary to the\r\nLord Treasurer, at his house in North Cray.\r\n\r\n19th August, 1660. Our vicar read the Thirty-nine Articles to the\r\ncongregation, the national assemblies beginning now to settle, and\r\nwanting instruction.\r\n\r\n23d August, 1660. Came Duke Hamilton, Lord Lothian, and several Scottish\r\nLords, to see my garden.\r\n\r\n25th August, 1660. Colonel Spencer, colonel of a regiment of horse in our\r\ncounty of Kent, sent to me, and intreated that I would take a commission\r\nfor a troop of horse, and that I would nominate my lieutenant and\r\nensigns; I thanked him for the honor intended me; but would by no means\r\nundertake the trouble.\r\n\r\n4th September, 1660. I was invited to an ordination by the Bishop of\r\nBangor, in Henry VII.'s chapel, Westminster, and afterward saw the\r\naudience of an Envoyée from the Duke of Anjou, sent to compliment his\r\nMajesty's return.\r\n\r\n5th September, 1660. Came to visit and dine with me the Envoyée of the\r\nKing of Poland, and Resident of the King of Denmark, etc.\r\n\r\n7th September, 1660. I went to Chelsea to visit Mr. Boyle, and see his\r\npneumatic engine perform divers experiments. Thence, to Kensington, to\r\nvisit Mr. Henshaw, returning home that evening.\r\n\r\n13th September, 1660. I saw in Southwark, at St. Margaret's fair, monkeys\r\nand apes dance, and do other feats of activity on the high rope; they\r\nwere gallantly clad _á la monde_, went upright, saluted the company,\r\nbowing and pulling off their hats; they saluted one another with as good\r\na grace as if instructed by a dancing master; they turned heels over head\r\nwith a basket having eggs in it, without breaking any; also, with lighted\r\ncandles in their hands, and on their heads, without extinguishing them,\r\nand with vessels of water without spilling a drop. I also saw an Italian\r\nwench dance, and perform all the tricks on the high rope to admiration;\r\nall the Court went to see her. Likewise, here was a man who took up a\r\npiece of iron cannon of about 400lb. weight with the hair of his head\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n17th September, 1660. Went to London, to see the splendid entry of the\r\nPrince de Ligne, Ambassador extraordinary from Spain; he was general of\r\nthe Spanish King's horse in Flanders, and was accompanied with divers\r\ngreat persons from thence, and an innumerable retinue. His train\r\nconsisted of seventeen coaches, with six horses of his own, besides a\r\ngreat number of English, etc. Greater bravery had I never seen. He was\r\nreceived in the Banqueting House, in exceeding state, all the great\r\nofficers of Court attending.\r\n\r\n23d September, 1660. In the midst of all this joy and jubilee, the Duke\r\nof Gloucester died of the smallpox, in the prime of youth, and a prince\r\nof extraordinary hopes.\r\n\r\n27th September, 1660. The King received the merchant's addresses in his\r\ncloset, giving them assurances of his persisting to keep Jamaica,\r\nchoosing Sir Edward Massey Governor. In the afternoon, the Danish\r\nAmbassador's condolences were presented, on the death of the Duke of\r\nGloucester. This evening, I saw the Princess Royal, mother to the Prince\r\nof Orange, now come out of Holland in a fatal period.\r\n\r\n6th October, 1660. I paid the great tax of poll money, levied for\r\ndisbanding the army, till now kept up. I paid as an Esquire £10, and one\r\nshilling for every servant in my house.\r\n\r\n7th October, 1660. There dined with me a French count, with Sir George\r\nTuke, who came to take leave of me, being sent over to the Queen-Mother,\r\nto break the marriage of the Duke with the daughter of Chancellor Hyde.\r\nThe Queen would fain have undone it; but it seems matters were\r\nreconciled, on great offers of the Chancellor's to befriend the Queen,\r\nwho was much in debt, and was now to have the settlement of her affairs\r\ngo through his hands.\r\n\r\n11th October, 1660. The regicides who sat on the life of our late King,\r\nwere brought to trial in the Old Bailey, before a commission of oyer and\r\nterminer.\r\n\r\n14th October, 1660. Axtall, Carew, Clement, Hacker, Hewson, and Peters,\r\nwere executed.\r\n\r\n17th October, 1660. Scot, Scroop, Cook, and Jones, suffered for reward of\r\ntheir iniquities at Charing Cross, in sight of the place where they put\r\nto death their natural prince, and in the presence of the King his son,\r\nwhom they also sought to kill. I saw not their execution, but met their\r\nquarters, mangled, and cut, and reeking, as they were brought from the\r\ngallows in baskets on the hurdle. Oh, the miraculous providence of God!\r\n\r\n28th October, 1660. His Majesty went to meet the Queen-Mother.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n29th October, 1660. Going to London, my Lord Mayor's show stopped me in\r\nCheapside; one of the pageants represented a great wood, with the royal\r\noak, and history of his Majesty's miraculous escape at Boscobel.\r\n\r\n31st October, 1660. Arrived now to my fortieth year, I rendered to\r\nAlmighty God my due and hearty thanks.\r\n\r\n1st November, 1660. I went with some of my relations to Court, to show\r\nthem his Majesty's cabinet and closet of rarities; the rare miniatures of\r\nPeter Oliver, after Raphael, Titian, and other masters, which I\r\ninfinitely esteem; also, that large piece of the Duchess of Lennox, done\r\nin enamel, by Petitot, and a vast number of agates, onyxes, and\r\nintaglios, especially a medallion of Cæsar, as broad as my hand;\r\nlikewise, rare cabinets of pietra-commessa, a landscape of needlework,\r\nformerly presented by the Dutch to King Charles I. Here I saw a vast book\r\nof maps, in a volume near four yards large; a curious ship model; and,\r\namong the clocks, one that showed the rising and setting of the sun in\r\nthe zodiac; the sun represented by a face and rays of gold, upon an azure\r\nsky, observing the diurnal and annual motion, rising and setting behind a\r\nlandscape of hills,--the work of our famous Fromantil,--and several other\r\nrarities.\r\n\r\n3d October, 1660. Arrived the Queen-Mother in England, whence she had\r\nbeen banished for almost twenty years; together with her illustrious\r\ndaughter, the Princess Henrietta, divers princes and noblemen,\r\naccompanying them.\r\n\r\n15th October, 1660. I kissed the Queen-Mother's hand.\r\n\r\n20th October, 1660. I dined at the Clerk Comptroller's of the Green\r\nCloth, being the first day of the re-establishment of the Court diet, and\r\nsettling of his Majesty's household.\r\n\r\n23d October, 1660. Being this day in the bedchamber of the Princess\r\nHenrietta, where were many great beauties and noblemen, I saluted divers\r\nof my old friends and acquaintances abroad; his Majesty carrying my wife\r\nto salute the Queen and Princess, and then led her into his closet, and\r\nwith his own hands showed her divers curiosities.\r\n\r\n25th October, 1660. Dr. Rainbow preached before the King, on Luke ii. 14,\r\nof the glory to be given God for all his mercies, especially for\r\nrestoring the Church and government; now the service was performed with\r\nmusic, voices, etc., as formerly.\r\n\r\n27th November, 1660. Came down the Clerk Comptroller [of the Green Cloth]\r\nby the Lord Steward's appointment, to survey the land at Sayes Court, on\r\nwhich I had pretense, and to make his report.\r\n\r\n6th December, 1660. I waited on my brother and sister Evelyn to Court.\r\nNow were presented to his Majesty those two rare pieces of drollery, or\r\nrather a Dutch Kitchen, painted by Dowe, so finely as hardly to be\r\ndistinguished from enamel. I was also shown divers rich jewels and\r\ncrystal vases; the rare head of Jo. Bellino, Titian's master; Christ in\r\nthe Garden, by Hannibal Caracci; two incomparable heads, by Holbein; the\r\nQueen-Mother in a miniature, almost as big as the life; an exquisite\r\npiece of carving; two unicorn's horns, etc. This in the closet.\r\n\r\n13th December, 1660. I presented my son, John, to the Queen-Mother, who\r\nkissed him, talked with and made extraordinary much of him.\r\n\r\n14th December, 1660. I visited my Lady Chancellor, the Marchioness of\r\nOrmond, and Countess of Guildford, all of whom we had known abroad in\r\nexile.\r\n\r\n18th December, 1660. I carried Mr. Spellman, a most ingenious gentleman,\r\ngrandchild to the learned Sir Henry, to my Lord Mordaunt, to whom I had\r\nrecommended him as secretary.\r\n\r\n21st December, 1660. This day died the Princess of Orange, of the\r\nsmallpox, which entirely altered the face and gallantry of the whole\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n22d December, 1660. The marriage of the Chancellor's daughter being now\r\nnewly owned, I went to see her, she being Sir Richard Browne's intimate\r\nacquaintance when she waited on the Princess of Orange; she was now at\r\nher father's, at Worcester House, in the Strand. We all kissed her hand,\r\nas did also my Lord Chamberlain (Manchester) and Countess of\r\nNorthumberland. This was a strange change--can it succeed well?--I spent\r\nthe evening at St. James's, whither the Princess Henrietta was retired\r\nduring the fatal sickness of her sister, the Princess of Orange, now come\r\nover to salute the King her brother. The Princess gave my wife an\r\nextraordinary compliment and gracious acceptance, for the \"Character\"[64]\r\nshe had presented her the day before, and which was afterward printed.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 64: \"A Character of England,\" reprinted in Evelyn's\r\n    \"Miscellaneous Writings,\" pp. 141-67.]\r\n\r\n25th December, 1660. Preached at the Abbey, Dr. Earle, Clerk of his\r\nMajesty's Closet, and my dear friend, now Dean of Westminster, on Luke\r\nii. 13, 14, condoling the breach made in the public joy by the lamented\r\ndeath of the Princess.\r\n\r\n30th December, 1660. I dined at Court with Mr. Crane, Clerk of the Green\r\nCloth.\r\n\r\n31st December, 1660. I gave God thanks for his many signal mercies to\r\nmyself, church, and nation, this wonderful year.\r\n\r\n2d January, 1661. The Queen-Mother, with the Princess Henrietta, began\r\nher journey to Portsmouth, in order to her return into France.\r\n\r\n5th January, 1661. I visited my Lord Chancellor Clarendon, with whom I\r\nhad been well acquainted abroad.\r\n\r\n6th January, 1661. Dr. Allestree preached at the Abbey, after which four\r\nBishops were consecrated, Hereford, Norwich, ...\r\n\r\nThis night was suppressed a bloody insurrection of some FIFTH-MONARCHY\r\nENTHUSIASTS. Some of them were examined at the Council the next day; but\r\ncould say nothing to extenuate their madness and unwarrantable zeal.\r\n\r\nI was now chosen (and nominated by his Majesty for one of the Council),\r\nby suffrage of the rest of the members, a Fellow of the Philosophic\r\nSociety now meeting at Gresham College, where was an assembly of divers\r\nlearned gentlemen. This being the first meeting since the King's return;\r\nbut it had been begun some years before at Oxford, and was continued with\r\ninterruption here in London during the Rebellion.\r\n\r\nThere was another rising of the fanatics, in which some were slain.\r\n\r\n16th January, 1661. I went to the Philosophic Club, where was examined\r\nthe Torricellian experiment. I presented my Circle of Mechanical Trades,\r\nand had recommended to me the publishing what I had written of\r\nChalcography.\r\n\r\n25th January, 1661. After divers years since I had seen any play, I went\r\nto see acted \"The Scornful Lady,\" at a new theater in Lincoln's-Inn\r\nFields.\r\n\r\n30th January, 1661. Was the first solemn fast and day of humiliation to\r\ndeplore the sins which had so long provoked God against this afflicted\r\nchurch and people, ordered by Parliament to be annually celebrated to\r\nexpiate the guilt of the execrable murder of the late King.\r\n\r\nThis day (Oh, the stupendous and inscrutable judgments of God!) were the\r\ncarcasses of those arch-rebels, Cromwell, Bradshawe (the judge who\r\ncondemned his Majesty), and Ireton (son-in-law to the Usurper), dragged\r\nout of their superb tombs in Westminster among the Kings, to Tyburn, and\r\nhanged on the gallows there from nine in the morning till six at night,\r\nand then buried under that fatal and ignominious monument in a deep pit;\r\nthousands of people who had seen them in all their pride being\r\nspectators. Look back at October 22, 1658,[65] and be astonished! and\r\nfear God and honor the King; but meddle not with them who are given to\r\nchange!\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 65: The entry in the \"Diary\" describing the Protector's\r\n    funeral.]\r\n\r\n6th February, 1661. To London, to our Society, where I gave notice of the\r\nvisit of the Danish Ambassador-Extraordinary, and was ordered to return\r\nhim their acceptance of that honor, and to invite him the next meeting\r\nday.\r\n\r\n10th February, 1661. Dr. Baldero preached at Ely-house, on Matthew vi.\r\n33, of seeking early the kingdom of God; after sermon, the Bishop (Dr.\r\nWren) gave us the blessing, very pontifically.\r\n\r\n13th February, 1661. I conducted the Danish Ambassador to our meeting at\r\nGresham College, where were shown him various experiments in vacuo, and\r\nother curiosities.\r\n\r\n21st February, 1661. Prince Rupert first showed me how to grave in _mezzo\r\ntinto_.\r\n\r\n26th February, 1661. I went to Lord Mordaunt's, at Parson's Green.\r\n\r\n27th February, 1661. Ash Wednesday. Preached before the King the Bishop\r\nof London (Dr. Sheldon) on Matthew xviii. 25, concerning charity and\r\nforgiveness.\r\n\r\n8th March, 1661. I went to my Lord Chancellor's, and delivered to him the\r\nstate of my concernment at Sayes Court.\r\n\r\n9th March, 1661. I went with that excellent person and philosopher, Sir\r\nRobert Murray, to visit Mr. Boyle at Chelsea, and saw divers effects of\r\nthe eolipile for weighing air.\r\n\r\n13th March, 1661. I went to Lambeth, with Sir R. Browne's pretense to the\r\nWardenship of Merton College, Oxford, to which, as having been about\r\nforty years before a student of that house, he was elected by the votes\r\nof every Fellow except one; but the statutes of the house being so that,\r\nunless every Fellow agree, the election devolves to the Visitor, who is\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury (Dr. Juxon), his Grace gave his nomination\r\nto Sir T. Clayton, resident there, and the Physic Professor: for which I\r\nwas not at all displeased, because, though Sir Richard missed it by much\r\ningratitude and wrong of the Archbishop (Clayton being no Fellow), yet it\r\nwould have hindered Sir Richard from attending at Court to settle his\r\ngreater concerns, and so have prejudiced me, though he was much inclined\r\nto have passed his time in a collegiate life, very unfit for him at that\r\ntime, for many reasons. So I took leave of his Grace, who was formerly\r\nLord Treasurer in the reign of Charles I.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon, Prince Rupert showed me, with his own hands, the new way\r\nof graving, called _mezzo tinto_, which afterward, by his permission, I\r\npublished in my \"History of Chalcography\"; this set so many artists on\r\nwork, that they soon arrived to the perfection it is since come to,\r\nemulating the tenderest miniatures.\r\n\r\nOur Society now gave in my relation of the Peak of Teneriffe, in the\r\nGreat Canaries, to be added to more queries concerning divers natural\r\nthings reported of that island.\r\n\r\nI returned home with my Cousin, Tuke, now going for France, as sent by\r\nhis Majesty to condole the death of that great Minister and politician,\r\nCount Mazarine.\r\n\r\n29th March, 1661. Dr. Heylin (author of the \"Geography\") preached at the\r\nAbbey, on Cant. v. 25, concerning friendship and charity; he was, I\r\nthink, at this time quite dark, and so had been for some years.\r\n\r\n31st March, 1661. This night, his Majesty promised to make my wife Lady\r\nof the Jewels (a very honorable charge) to the future Queen (but which he\r\nnever performed).\r\n\r\n1st April, 1661. I dined with that great mathematician and virtuoso,\r\nMonsieur Zulichem, inventor of the pendule clock, and discoverer of the\r\nphenomenon of Saturn's annulus: he was elected into our Society.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n19th April, 1661. To London, and saw the bathing and rest of the\r\nceremonies of the Knights of the Bath, preparatory to the coronation; it\r\nwas in the Painted Chamber, Westminster. I might have received this\r\nhonor; but declined it. The rest of the ceremony was in the chapel at\r\nWhitehall, when their swords being laid on the altar, the Bishop\r\ndelivered them.\r\n\r\n22d April, 1661. Was the splendid cavalcade of his Majesty from the Tower\r\nof London to Whitehall, when I saw him in the Banqueting House create six\r\nEarls, and as many Barons, viz:\r\n\r\nEdward Lord Hyde, Lord Chancellor, Earl of Clarendon; supported by the\r\nEarls of Northumberland and Sussex; the Earl of Bedford carried the cap\r\nand coronet, the Earl of Warwick, the sword, the Earl of Newport, the\r\nmantle.\r\n\r\n  Next, was Capel, created Earl of Essex.\r\n            Brudenell,             Cardigan;\r\n            Valentia,              Anglesea;\r\n            Greenvill,             Bath; and\r\n            Howard, Earl of Carlisle.\r\n\r\nThe Barons were: Denzille Holles; Cornwallis; Booth; Townsend; Cooper;\r\nCrew; who were led up by several Peers, with Garter and officers of arms\r\nbefore them; when, after obedience on their several approaches to the\r\nthrone, their patents were presented by Garter King-at-Arms, which being\r\nreceived by the Lord Chamberlain, and delivered to his Majesty, and by\r\nhim to the Secretary of State, were read, and then again delivered to his\r\nMajesty, and by him to the several Lords created; they were then robed,\r\ntheir coronets and collars put on by his Majesty, and they were placed in\r\nrank on both sides of the state and throne; but the Barons put off their\r\ncaps and circles, and held them in their hands, the Earls keeping on\r\ntheir coronets, as cousins to the King.\r\n\r\nI spent the rest of the evening in seeing the several archtriumphals\r\nbuilt in the streets at several eminent places through which his Majesty\r\nwas next day to pass, some of which, though temporary, and to stand but\r\none year, were of good invention and architecture, with inscriptions.\r\n\r\n23d April, 1661. Was the coronation of his Majesty Charles II. in the\r\nAbbey-Church of Westminster; at all which ceremony I was present. The\r\nKing and his Nobility went to the Tower, I accompanying my Lord Viscount\r\nMordaunt part of the way; this was on Sunday, the 22d; but indeed his\r\nMajesty went not till early this morning, and proceeded from thence to\r\nWestminster in this order:\r\n\r\nFirst went the Duke of York's Horse Guards. Messengers of the Chamber.\r\n136 Esquires to the Knights of the Bath, each of whom had two, most\r\nrichly habited. The Knight Harbinger. Sergeant Porter. Sewers of the\r\nChamber. Quarter Waiters.

Two persons\r\nrepresenting the Dukes of Normandy and Acquitaine, viz, Sir Richard\r\nFanshawe and Sir Herbert Price, in fantastic habits of the time.\r\nGentlemen Ushers. Garter. Lord Mayor of London. The Duke of York alone\r\n(the rest by twos). Lord High Constable of England. Lord Great\r\nChamberlain of England. The sword borne by the Earl Marshal of England.\r\nThe KING, in royal robes and equipage. Afterward, followed equerries,\r\nfootmen, gentlemen pensioners. Master of the Horse, leading a horse\r\nrichly caparisoned. Vice-Chamberlain. Captain of the Pensioners. Captain\r\nof the Guard. The Guard. The Horse Guard. The troop of Volunteers, with\r\nmany other officers and gentlemen.\r\n\r\nThis magnificent train on horseback, as rich as embroidery, velvet, cloth\r\nof gold and silver, and jewels, could make them and their prancing\r\nhorses, proceeded through the streets strewed with flowers, houses hung\r\nwith rich tapestry, windows and balconies full of ladies; the London\r\nmilitia lining the ways, and the several companies, with their banners\r\nand loud music, ranked in their orders; the fountains running wine, bells\r\nringing, with speeches made at the several triumphal arches; at that of\r\nthe Temple Bar (near which I stood) the Lord Mayor was received by the\r\nBailiff of Westminster, who, in a scarlet robe, made a speech. Thence,\r\nwith joyful acclamations, his Majesty passed to Whitehall. Bonfires at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe next day, being St. George's, he went by water to Westminster Abbey.\r\nWhen his Majesty was entered, the Dean and Prebendaries brought all the\r\nregalia, and delivered them to several noblemen to bear before the King,\r\nwho met them at the west door of the church, singing an anthem, to the\r\nchoir. Then, came the Peers, in their robes, and coronets in their hands,\r\ntill his Majesty was placed on a throne elevated before the altar.\r\nAfterward, the Bishop of London (the Archbishop of Canterbury being sick)\r\nwent to every side of the throne to present the King to the people,\r\nasking if they would have him for their King, and do him homage; at this,\r\nthey shouted four times \"God save King Charles II!\" Then, an anthem was\r\nsung. His Majesty, attended by three Bishops, went up to the altar, and\r\nhe offered a pall and a pound of gold. Afterward, he sat down in another\r\nchair during the sermon, which was preached by Dr. Morley, Bishop of\r\nWorcester.\r\n\r\nAfter sermon, the King took his oath before the altar to maintain the\r\nreligion, Magna Charta, and laws of the land. The hymn _Véni S. Sp._\r\nfollowed, and then the Litany by two Bishops. Then the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, present, but much indisposed and weak, said \"Lift up your\r\nhearts\"; at which, the King rose up, and put off his robes and upper\r\ngarments, and was in a waistcoat so opened in divers places, that the\r\nArchbishop might commodiously anoint him, first in the palms of his\r\nhands, when an anthem was sung, and a prayer read; then, his breast and\r\nbetween the shoulders, bending of both arms; and, lastly, on the crown of\r\nthe head, with apposite hymns and prayers at each anointing; this done,\r\nthe Dean closed and buttoned up the waistcoat. After which, was a coif\r\nput on, and the cobbium, sindon or dalmatic, and over this a super-tunic\r\nof cloth of gold, with buskins and sandals of the same, spurs, and the\r\nsword; a prayer being first said over it by the Archbishop on the altar,\r\nbefore it was girt on by the Lord Chamberlain. Then, the armill, mantle,\r\netc. Then, the Archbishop placed the crown imperial on the altar, prayed\r\nover it, and set it on his Majesty's head, at which all the Peers put on\r\ntheir coronets. Anthems, and rare music, with lutes, viols, trumpets,\r\norgans, and voices, were then heard, and the Archbishop put a ring on his\r\nMajesty's finger. The King next offered his sword on the altar, which\r\nbeing redeemed, was drawn, and borne before him. Then, the Archbishop\r\ndelivered him the sceptre, with the dove in one hand, and, in the other,\r\nthe sceptre with the globe. The King kneeling, the Archbishop pronounced\r\nthe blessing. His Majesty then ascending again his royal throne, while\r\n_Te Deum_ was singing, all the Peers did their homage, by every one\r\ntouching his crown. The Archbishop, and the rest of the Bishops, first\r\nkissing the King; who received the Holy Sacrament, and so disrobed, yet\r\nwith the crown imperial on his head, and accompanied with all the\r\nnobility in the former order, he went on foot upon blue cloth, which was\r\nspread and reached from the west door of the Abbey to Westminster stairs,\r\nwhen he took water in a triumphal barge to Whitehall where was\r\nextraordinary feasting.\r\n\r\n24th April, 1661. I presented his Majesty with his \"Panegyric\"[66] in the\r\nPrivy Chamber, which he was pleased to accept most graciously; I gave\r\ncopies to the Lord Chancellor, and most of the noblemen who came to me\r\nfor it. I dined at the Marquis of Ormond's where was a magnificent feast,\r\nand many great persons.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 66: A poem which Evelyn had composed on his Majesty's\r\n    Coronation; the 23d of April, 1661, being St. George's day.]\r\n\r\n1st May, 1661. I went to Hyde Park to take the air, where was his Majesty\r\nand an innumerable appearance of gallants and rich coaches, being now a\r\ntime of universal festivity and joy.\r\n\r\n2d May, 1661. I had audience of my Lord Chancellor about my title to\r\nSayes Court.\r\n\r\n3d May, 1661. I went to see the wonderful engine for weaving silk\r\nstockings, said to have been the invention of an Oxford scholar forty\r\nyears since; and I returned by Fromantil's, the famous clockmaker, to see\r\nsome pendules, Monsieur Zulichem being with us.\r\n\r\nThis evening, I was with my Lord Brouncker, Sir Robert Murray, Sir\r\nPatrick Neill, Monsieur Zulichem, and Bull (all of them of our Society,\r\nand excellent mathematicians), to show his Majesty, who was present,\r\nSaturn's annulus, as some thought, but as Zulichem affirmed with his\r\n_balteus_ (as that learned gentleman had published), very near eclipsed\r\nby the moon, near the Mons Porphyritis; also, Jupiter and satellites,\r\nthrough his Majesty's great telescope, drawing thirty-five feet; on which\r\nwere divers discourses.\r\n\r\n8th May, 1661. His Majesty rode in state, with his imperial crown on, and\r\nall the peers in their robes, in great pomp to the Parliament now newly\r\nchosen (the old one being dissolved); and, that evening, declared in\r\ncouncil his intention to marry the Infanta of Portugal.\r\n\r\n9th May, 1661. At Sir Robert Murray's, where I met Dr. Wallis, Professor\r\nof Geometry in Oxford, where was discourse of several mathematical\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n11th May, 1661. My wife presented to his Majesty the Madonna she had\r\ncopied in miniature from P. Oliver's painting, after Raphael, which she\r\nwrought with extraordinary pains and judgment. The King was infinitely\r\npleased with it, and caused it to be placed in his cabinet among his best\r\npaintings.\r\n\r\n13th May, 1661. I heard and saw such exercises at the election of\r\nscholars at Westminster School to be sent to the University in Latin,\r\nGreek, Hebrew, and Arabic, in themes and extemporary verses, as\r\nwonderfully astonished me in such youths, with such readiness and wit,\r\nsome of them not above twelve or thirteen years of age. Pity it is, that\r\nwhat they attain here so ripely, they either do not retain, or do not\r\nimprove more considerably when they come to be men, though many of them\r\ndo; and no less is to be blamed their odd pronouncing of Latin, so that\r\nout of England none were able to understand, or endure it. The\r\nexaminants, or posers, were, Dr. Duport, Greek Professor at Cambridge;\r\nDr. Fell, Dean of Christ Church, Oxford; Dr. Pierson; Dr. Allestree, Dean\r\nof Westminster, and any that would.\r\n\r\n14th May, 1661. His Majesty was pleased to discourse with me concerning\r\nseveral particulars relating to our Society, and the planet Saturn, etc.,\r\nas he sat at supper in the withdrawing-room to his bedchamber.\r\n\r\n16th May, 1661. I dined with Mr. Garmus, the Resident from Hamburg, who\r\ncontinued his feast near nine whole hours, according to the custom of his\r\ncountry, though there was no great excess of drinking, no man being\r\nobliged to take more than he liked.\r\n\r\n22d May, 1661. The Scotch Covenant was burnt by the common hangman in\r\ndivers places in London. Oh, prodigious change!\r\n\r\n29th May, 1661. This was the first anniversary appointed by act of\r\nParliament to be observed as a day of general thanksgiving for the\r\nmiraculous restoration of his Majesty: our vicar preaching on Psalm\r\ncxviii. 24, requiring us to be thankful and rejoice, as indeed we had\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n4th June, 1661. Came Sir Charles Harbord, his Majesty's surveyor, to take\r\nan account of what grounds I challenged at Sayes Court.\r\n\r\n27th June, 1661. I saw the Portugal ambassador at dinner with his Majesty\r\nin state, where was excellent music.\r\n\r\n2d July, 1661. I went to see the New Spring-Garden, at Lambeth, a\r\nprettily contrived plantation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEPTFORD]\r\n\r\n19th July, 1661. We tried our Diving-Bell, or engine, in the water dock\r\nat Deptford, in which our curator continued half an hour under water; it\r\nwas made of cast lead, let down with a strong cable.\r\n\r\n3d August, 1661. Came my Lord Hatton, Comptroller of his Majesty's\r\nhousehold to visit me.\r\n\r\n9th August, 1661. I tried several experiments on the sensitive plant and\r\n_humilis_, which contracted with the least touch of the sun through a\r\nburning glass, though it rises and opens only when it shines on it.\r\n\r\nI first saw the famous Queen Pine brought from Barbadoes, and presented\r\nto his Majesty; but the first that were ever seen in England were those\r\nsent to Cromwell four years since.\r\n\r\nI dined at Mr. Palmer's in Gray's Inn, whose curiosity excelled in clocks\r\nand pendules, especially one that had innumerable motions, and played\r\nnine or ten tunes on the bells very finely, some of them set in parts:\r\nwhich was very harmonious. It was wound up but once in a quarter. He had\r\nalso good telescopes and mathematical instruments, choice pictures, and\r\nother curiosities. Thence, we went to that famous mountebank, Jo.\r\nPunteus.\r\n\r\nSir Kenelm Digby presented every one of us his \"Discourse of the\r\nVegetation of Plants\"; and Mr. Henshaw, his \"History of Saltpeter and\r\nGunpowder.\" I assisted him to procure his place of French Secretary to\r\nthe King, which he purchased of Sir Henry De Vic.\r\n\r\nI went to that famous physician, Sir Fr. Prujean, who showed me his\r\nlaboratory, his workhouse for turning, and other mechanics; also many\r\nexcellent pictures, especially the Magdalen of Caracci; and some\r\nincomparable _paysages_ done in distemper; he played to me likewise on\r\nthe _polythore_, an instrument having something of the harp, lute, and\r\ntheorbo; by none known in England, nor described by any author, nor used,\r\nbut by this skillful and learned Doctor.\r\n\r\n15th August, 1661. I went to Tunbridge-Wells, my wife being there for the\r\nbenefit of her health. Walking about the solitudes, I greatly admired the\r\nextravagant turnings, insinuations, and growth of certain birch trees\r\namong the rocks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n13th September, 1661. I presented my \"_Fumifugium_\"[67] dedicated to his\r\nMajesty, who was pleased that I should publish it by his special\r\ncommands, being much gratified with it.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 67: This pamphlet having become scarce, was in 1772\r\n    reprinted in 4to, and is now incorporated in Evelyn's \"Miscellaneous\r\n    Writings.\"]\r\n\r\n18th September, 1661. This day was read our petition to his Majesty for\r\nhis royal grant, authorizing our Society to meet as a corporation, with\r\nseveral privileges.\r\n\r\nAn exceedingly sickly, wet autumn.\r\n\r\n1st October, 1661. I sailed this morning with his Majesty in one of his\r\nyachts (or pleasure boats), vessels not known among us till the Dutch\r\nEast India Company presented that curious piece to the King; being very\r\nexcellent sailing vessels. It was on a wager between his other new\r\npleasure boat, built frigate-like, and one of the Duke of York's; the\r\nwager £100; the race from Greenwich to Gravesend and back. The King lost\r\nit going, the wind being contrary, but saved stakes in returning. There\r\nwere divers noble persons and lords on board, his Majesty sometimes\r\nsteering himself. His barge and kitchen boat attended. I brake fast this\r\nmorning with the King at return in his smaller vessel, he being pleased\r\nto take me and only four more, who were noblemen, with him; but dined in\r\nhis yacht, where we all ate together with his Majesty. In this passage he\r\nwas pleased to discourse to me about my book inveighing against the\r\nnuisance of the smoke of London, and proposing expedients how, by\r\nremoving those particulars I mentioned, it might be reformed; commanding\r\nme to prepare a Bill against the next session of Parliament, being, as he\r\nsaid, resolved to have something done in it. Then he discoursed to me of\r\nthe improvement of gardens and buildings, now very rare in England\r\ncomparatively to other countries. He then commanded me to draw up the\r\nmatter of fact happening at the bloody encounter which then had newly\r\nhappened between the French and Spanish Ambassadors near the Tower,\r\ncontending for precedency, at the reception of the Swedish Ambassador;\r\ngiving me orders to consult Sir William Compton, Master of the Ordnance,\r\nto inform me of what he knew of it, and with his favorite, Sir Charles\r\nBerkeley, captain of the Duke's life guard, then present with his troop\r\nand three foot companies; with some other reflections and instructions,\r\nto be prepared with a declaration to take off the reports which went\r\nabout of his Majesty's partiality in the affairs, and of his officers'\r\nand spectators' rudeness while the conflict lasted. So I came home that\r\nnight, and went next morning to London, where from the officers of the\r\nTower, Sir William Compton, Sir Charles Berkeley, and others who were\r\nattending at this meeting of the Ambassadors three days before, having\r\ncollected what I could, I drew up a Narrative in vindication of his\r\nMajesty, and the carriage of his officers and standers-by.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday his Majesty sent one of the pages of the back stairs for me\r\nto wait on him with my papers, in his cabinet where was present only Sir\r\nHenry Bennett (Privy-Purse), when beginning to read to his Majesty what I\r\nhad drawn up, by the time I had read half a page, came in Mr. Secretary\r\nMorice with a large paper, desiring to speak with his Majesty, who told\r\nhim he was now very busy, and therefore ordered him to come again some\r\nother time; the Secretary replied that what he had in his hand was of\r\nextraordinary importance. So the King rose up, and, commanding me to\r\nstay, went aside to a corner of the room with the Secretary; after a\r\nwhile, the Secretary being dispatched, his Majesty returning to me at\r\nthe table, a letter was brought him from Madame out of France;[68] this\r\nhe read and then bid me proceed from where I left off. This I did till I\r\nhad ended all the narrative, to his Majesty's great satisfaction; and,\r\nafter I had inserted one or two more clauses, in which his Majesty\r\ninstructed me, commanded that it should that night be sent to the\r\nposthouse, directed to the Lord Ambassador at Paris (the Earl of St.\r\nAlban's), and then at leisure to prepare him a copy, which he would\r\npublish. This I did, and immediately sent my papers to the Secretary of\r\nState, with his Majesty's express command of dispatching them that night\r\nfor France. Before I went out of the King's closet, he called me back to\r\nshow me some ivory statues, and other curiosities that I had not seen\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 68: Henrietta Maria.]\r\n\r\n3d October, 1661. Next evening, being in the withdrawing-room adjoining\r\nthe bedchamber, his Majesty espying me came to me from a great crowd of\r\nnoblemen standing near the fire, and asked me if I had done; and told me\r\nhe feared it might be a little too sharp, on second thoughts, for he had\r\nthat morning spoken with the French Ambassador, who it seems had\r\npalliated the matter, and was very tame; and therefore directed me where\r\nI should soften a period or two, before it was published (as afterward it\r\nwas). This night also he spoke to me to give him a sight of what was\r\nsent, and to bring it to him in his bedchamber; which I did, and received\r\nit again from him at dinner, next day. By Saturday, having finished it\r\nwith all his Majesty's notes, the King being gone abroad, I sent the\r\npapers to Sir Henry Bennett (Privy-Purse and a great favorite), and\r\nslipped home, being myself much indisposed and harassed with going about,\r\nand sitting up to write.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n19th October, 1661. I went to London to visit my Lord of Bristol, having\r\nbeen with Sir John Denham (his Majesty's surveyor) to consult with him\r\nabout the placing of his palace at Greenwich, which I would have had\r\nbuilt between the river and the Queen's house, so as a large square cut\r\nshould have let in the Thames like a bay; but Sir John was for setting it\r\non piles at the very brink of the water, which I did not assent to; and\r\nso came away, knowing Sir John to be a better poet than architect,\r\nthough he had Mr. Webb (Inigo Jones's man) to assist him.\r\n\r\n29th October, 1661. I saw the Lord Mayor pass in his water triumph to\r\nWestminster, being the first solemnity of this nature after twenty years.\r\n\r\n2d November, 1661. Came Sir Henry Bennett, since Lord Arlington, to visit\r\nme, and to acquaint me that his Majesty would do me the honor to come and\r\nsee my garden; but, it being then late, it was deferred.\r\n\r\n3d November, 1661. One Mr. Breton preached his probation sermon at our\r\nparish church, and indeed made a most excellent discourse on John i. 29,\r\nof God's free grace to penitents, so that I could not but recommend him\r\nto the patron.\r\n\r\n10th November, 1661. In the afternoon, preached at the Abbey Dr. Basire,\r\nthat great traveler, or rather French Apostle, who had been planting the\r\nChurch of England in divers parts of the Levant and Asia. He showed that\r\nthe Church of England was, for purity of doctrine, substance, decency,\r\nand beauty, the most perfect under Heaven; that England was the very land\r\nof Goshen.\r\n\r\n11th November, 1661. I was so idle as to go to see a play called \"Love\r\nand Honor.\" Dined at Arundel House; and that evening discoursed with his\r\nMajesty about shipping, in which he was exceedingly skillful.\r\n\r\n15th November, 1661. I dined with the Duke of Ormond, who told me there\r\nwere no moles in Ireland, nor any rats till of late, and that in but one\r\ncounty; but it was a mistake that spiders would not live there, only they\r\nwere not poisonous. Also, that they frequently took salmon with dogs.\r\n\r\n16th November, 1661. I presented my translation of \"Naudæus concerning\r\nLibraries\" to my Lord Chancellor; but it was miserably false printed.\r\n\r\n17th November, 1661. Dr. Creighton, a Scot, author of the \"Florentine\r\nCouncil,\" and a most eloquent man and admirable Grecian, preached on\r\nCant. vi. 13, celebrating the return and restoration of the Church and\r\nKing.\r\n\r\n20th November, 1661. At the Royal Society, Sir William Petty proposed\r\ndivers things for the improvement of shipping; a versatile keel that\r\nshould be on hinges and concerning sheathing ships with thin lead.\r\n\r\n24th November, 1661. This night his Majesty fell into discourse with me\r\nconcerning bees, etc.\r\n\r\n26th November, 1661. I saw \"Hamlet, Prince of Denmark\" played; but now\r\nthe old plays began to disgust this refined age, since his Majesty's\r\nbeing so long abroad.\r\n\r\n28th November, 1661. I dined at Chiffinch's house-warming, in St. James's\r\nPark; he was his Majesty's closet-keeper, and had his new house full of\r\ngood pictures, etc. There dined with us Russell, Popish Bishop of Cape\r\nVerd, who was sent out to negotiate his Majesty's match with the Infanta\r\nof Portugal, after the Ambassador was returned.\r\n\r\n29th November, 1661. I dined at the Countess of Peterborough's and went\r\nthat evening to Parson's Green with my Lord Mordaunt, with whom I stayed\r\nthat night.\r\n\r\n1st December, 1661. I took leave of my Lord Peterborough, going now to\r\nTangier, which was to be delivered to the English on the match with\r\nPortugal.\r\n\r\n3d December, 1661. By universal suffrage of our philosophic assembly, an\r\norder was made and registered that I should receive their public thanks\r\nfor the honorable mention I made of them by the name of Royal Society, in\r\nmy Epistle dedicatory to the Lord Chancellor, before my Traduction of\r\nNaudæus. Too great an honor for a trifle.\r\n\r\n4th December, 1661. I had much discourse with the Duke of York,\r\nconcerning strange cures he affirmed of a woman who swallowed a whole ear\r\nof barley, which worked out at her side. I told him of the KNIFE\r\nSWALLOWED[69] and the pins.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 69: This refers to the Dutchman, _ante_, 28th August,\r\n    1641; and to an extraordinary case contained in a \"Miraculous Cure\r\n    of the Prussian Swallow Knife, etc., by Dan Lakin, P. C.\" quarto,\r\n    London, 1642, with a woodcut representing the object of the cure and\r\n    the size of the knife.]\r\n\r\nI took leave of the Bishop of Cape Verd, now going in the fleet to bring\r\nover our new Queen.\r\n\r\n7th December, 1661. I dined at Arundel House, the day when the great\r\ncontest in Parliament was concerning the restoring the Duke of Norfolk;\r\nhowever, it was carried for him. I also presented my little trifle of\r\nSumptuary Laws, entitled \"Tyrannus\" [or \"The Mode\"].\r\n\r\n14th December, 1661. I saw otter hunting with the King, and killed one.\r\n\r\n16th December, 1661. I saw a French comedy acted at Whitehall.\r\n\r\n20th December, 1661. The Bishop of Gloucester preached at the Abbey at\r\nthe funeral of the Bishop of Hereford, brother to the Duke of Albemarle.\r\nIt was a decent solemnity. There was a silver miter, with episcopal\r\nrobes, borne by the herald before the hearse, which was followed by the\r\nDuke his brother, and all the bishops, with divers noblemen.\r\n\r\n23d December, 1661. I heard an Italian play and sing to the guitar with\r\nextraordinary skill before the Duke.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n1st January, 1661-62. I went to London, invited to the solemn foolery of\r\nthe Prince de la Grange, at Lincoln's-Inn, where came the King, Duke,\r\netc. It began with a grand masque, and a formal pleading before the mock\r\nPrinces, Grandees, Nobles, and Knights of the Sun. He had his Lord\r\nChancellor, Chamberlain, Treasurer, and other Royal Officers, gloriously\r\nclad and attended. It ended in a magnificent banquet. One Mr. Lort was\r\nthe young spark who maintained the pageantry.\r\n\r\n6th January, 1662. This evening, according to custom, his Majesty opened\r\nthe revels of that night by throwing the dice himself in the privy\r\nchamber, where was a table set on purpose, and lost his £100. (The year\r\nbefore he won £1,500.) The ladies also played very deep. I came away when\r\nthe Duke of Ormond had won about £1,000, and left them still at passage,\r\ncards, etc. At other tables, both there and at the groom-porter's,\r\nobserving the wicked folly and monstrous excess of passion among some\r\nlosers; sorry am I that such a wretched custom as play to that excess\r\nshould be countenanced in a Court, which ought to be an example of virtue\r\nto the rest of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n9th January, 1662. I saw acted \"The Third Part of the Siege of Rhodes.\"\r\nIn this acted the fair and famous comedian called Roxalana from the part\r\nshe performed; and I think it was the last, she being taken to be the\r\nEarl of Oxford's MISS (as at this time they began to call lewd women). It\r\nwas in recitative music.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n10th January, 1662. Being called into his Majesty's closet when Mr.\r\nCooper, the rare limner, was crayoning of the King's face and head, to\r\nmake the stamps for the new milled money now contriving, I had the honor\r\nto hold the candle while it was doing, he choosing the night and\r\ncandlelight for the better finding out the shadows. During this, his\r\nMajesty discoursed with me on several things relating to painting and\r\ngraving.\r\n\r\n11th January, 1662. I dined at Arundel House, where I heard excellent\r\nmusic performed by the ablest masters, both French and English, on\r\ntheorbos, viols, organs, and voices, as an exercise against the coming of\r\nthe Queen, purposely composed for her chapel. Afterward, my Lord Aubigny\r\n(her Majesty's Almoner to be) showed us his elegant lodging, and his\r\nwheel-chair for ease and motion, with divers other curiosities;\r\nespecially a kind of artificial glass, or porcelain, adorned with\r\nrelievos of paste, hard and beautiful. Lord Aubigny (brother to the Duke\r\nof Lennox) was a person of good sense, but wholly abandoned to ease and\r\neffeminacy.\r\n\r\nI received of Sir Peter Ball, the Queen's attorney, a draft of an Act\r\nagainst the nuisance of the smoke of London, to be reformed by removing\r\nseveral trades which are the cause of it, and endanger the health of the\r\nKing and his people. It was to have been offered to the Parliament, as\r\nhis Majesty commanded.\r\n\r\n12th January, 1662. At St. James's chapel preached, or rather harangued,\r\nthe famous orator, Monsieur Morus, in French. There were present the\r\nKing, Duke, French Ambassador, Lord Aubigny, Earl of Bristol, and a world\r\nof Roman Catholics, drawn thither to hear this eloquent Protestant.\r\n\r\n15th January, 1662. There was a general fast through the whole nation,\r\nand now celebrated in London, to avert God's heavy judgments on this\r\nland. Great rain had fallen without any frost, or seasonable cold, not\r\nonly in England, but in Sweden, and the most northern parts, being here\r\nnear as warm as at midsummer in some years.\r\n\r\nThis solemn fast was held for the House of Commons at St. Margaret's. Dr.\r\nReeves, Dean of Windsor, preached on Joshua vii. 12, showing how the\r\nneglect of exacting justice on offenders (by which he insinuated such of\r\nthe old King's murderers as were yet reprieved and in the Tower) was a\r\nmain cause of God's punishing a land. He brought in that of the\r\nGibeonites, as well as Achan and others, concluding with an eulogy of the\r\nParliament for their loyalty in restoring the Bishops and Clergy, and\r\nvindicating the Church from sacrilege.\r\n\r\n16th January, 1662. Having notice of the Duke of York's intention to\r\nvisit my poor habitation and garden this day, I returned, when he was\r\npleased to do me that honor of his own accord, and to stay some time\r\nviewing such things as I had to entertain his curiosity. Afterward he\r\ncaused me to dine with him at the Treasurer of the Navy's house, and to\r\nsit with him covered at the same table. There were his Highness, the Duke\r\nof Ormond, and several Lords. Then they viewed some of my grounds about a\r\nproject for a receptacle for ships to be moored in, which was laid aside\r\nas a fancy of Sir Nicholas Crisp. After this, I accompanied the Duke to\r\nan East India vessel that lay at Blackwall, where we had entertainment of\r\nseveral curiosities. Among other spirituous drinks, as punch, etc., they\r\ngave us Canary that had been carried to and brought from the Indies,\r\nwhich was indeed incomparably good. I returned to London with his\r\nHighness. This night was acted before his Majesty \"The Widow,\" a lewd\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n18th January, 1662. I came home to be private a little, not at all\r\naffecting the life and hurry of Court.\r\n\r\n24th January, 1662. His Majesty entertained me with his intentions of\r\nbuilding his Palace of Greenwich, and quite demolishing the old one; on\r\nwhich I declared my thoughts.\r\n\r\n25th January, 1662. I dined with the Trinity Company at their house, that\r\ncorporation being by charter fixed at Deptford.\r\n\r\n3d February, 1662. I went to Chelsea, to see Sir Arthur Gorges' house.\r\n\r\n11th February, 1662. I saw a comedy acted before the Duchess of York at\r\nthe Cockpit. The King was not at it.\r\n\r\n17th February, 1662. I went with my Lord of Bristol to see his house at\r\nWimbledon, newly bought of the Queen-Mother, to help contrive the garden\r\nafter the modern. It is a delicious place for prospect and the thickets,\r\nbut the soil cold and weeping clay. Returned that evening with Sir Henry\r\nBennett.\r\n\r\nThis night was buried in Westminster Abbey the Queen of Bohemia, after\r\nall her sorrows and afflictions being come to die in the arms of her\r\nnephew, the King; also this night and the next day fell such a storm of\r\nhail, thunder, and lightning, as never was seen the like in any man's\r\nmemory, especially the tempest of wind, being southwest, which subverted,\r\nbesides huge trees, many houses, innumerable chimneys (among others that\r\nof my parlor at Sayes Court), and made such havoc at land and sea, that\r\nseveral perished on both. Divers lamentable fires were also kindled at\r\nthis time; so exceedingly was God's hand against this ungrateful and\r\nvicious nation and Court.\r\n\r\n20th February, 1662. I returned home to repair my house, miserably\r\nshattered by the late tempest.\r\n\r\n24th March, 1662. I returned home with my whole family, which had been\r\nmost part of the winter, since October, at London, in lodgings near the\r\nAbbey of Westminster.\r\n\r\n6th April, 1662. Being of the Vestry, in the afternoon we ordered that\r\nthe communion-table should be set (as usual) altar-wise, with a decent\r\nrail in front, as before the Rebellion.\r\n\r\n17th April, 1662. The young Marquis of Argyle, whose turbulent father was\r\nexecuted in Scotland, came to see my garden. He seemed a man of parts.\r\n\r\n7th May, 1662. I waited on Prince Rupert to our Assembly where were tried\r\nseveral experiments in Mr. Boyle's VACUUM. A man thrusting in his arm,\r\nupon exhaustion of the air, had his flesh immediately swelled so as the\r\nblood was near bursting the veins: he drawing it out, we found it all\r\nspeckled.\r\n\r\n14th May, 1662. To London, being chosen one of the Commissioners for\r\nreforming the buildings, ways, streets, and incumbrances, and regulating\r\nthe hackney coaches in the city of London, taking my oath before my Lord\r\nChancellor, and then went to his Majesty's Surveyor's office, in Scotland\r\nYard, about naming and establishing officers, adjourning till the 16th,\r\nwhen I went to view how St. Martin's Lane might be made more passable\r\ninto the Strand. There were divers gentlemen of quality in this\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\n25th May, 1662. I went this evening to London, in order to our journey\r\nto Hampton Court, to see the Queen; who, having landed at Portsmouth, had\r\nbeen married to the King a week before by the Bishop of London.\r\n\r\n30th May, 1662. The Queen arrived with a train of Portuguese ladies in\r\ntheir monstrous fardingales, or guard-infantes, their complexions\r\nolivader[70] and sufficiently unagreeable. Her Majesty in the same habit,\r\nher foretop long and turned aside very strangely. She was yet of the\r\nhandsomest countenance of all the rest, and, though low of stature,\r\nprettily shaped, languishing and excellent eyes, her teeth wronging her\r\nmouth by sticking a little too far out; for the rest, lovely enough.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 70: Of a dark olive complexion. It has been noticed in\r\n    other accounts that Katharine of Braganza's Portuguese Ladies of\r\n    Honor, who came over with her, were uncommonly ill-favored, and\r\n    disagreeable in their appearance. See Faithorne's curious print of\r\n    the Queen in the costume here described.]\r\n\r\n31st May, 1662. I saw the Queen at dinner; the Judges came to compliment\r\nher arrival, and, after them, the Duke of Ormond brought me to kiss her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n2d June, 1662. The Lord Mayor and Aldermen made their addresses to the\r\nQueen, presenting her £1,000 in gold. Now saw I her Portuguese ladies,\r\nand the Guardadamas, or mother of her maids,[71] and the old knight, a\r\nlock of whose hair quite covered the rest of his bald pate, bound on by a\r\nthread, very oddly. I saw the rich gondola sent to his Majesty from the\r\nState of Venice; but it was not comparable for swiftness to our common\r\nwherries, though managed by Venetians.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 71: The Maids of Honor had a mother at least as early as\r\n    the reign of Elizabeth. The office is supposed to have been\r\n    abolished about the period of the Revolution of 1688.]\r\n\r\n4th June, 1662. Went to visit the Earl of Bristol, at Wimbledon.\r\n\r\n8th June, 1662. I saw her Majesty at supper privately in her bedchamber.\r\n\r\n9th June, 1662. I heard the Queen's Portugal music, consisting of pipes,\r\nharps, and very ill voices.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HAMPTON COURT]\r\n\r\nHampton Court is as noble and uniform a pile, and as capacious as any\r\nGothic architecture can have made it. There is an incomparable furniture\r\nin it, especially hangings designed by Raphael, very rich with gold; also\r\nmany rare pictures, especially the Cæsarean Triumphs of Andrea Mantegna,\r\nformerly the Duke of Mantua's; of the tapestries, I believe the world can\r\nshow nothing nobler of the kind than the stories of Abraham and Tobit.\r\nThe gallery of horns is very particular for the vast beams of stags,\r\nelks, antelopes, etc. The Queen's bed was an embroidery of silver on\r\ncrimson velvet, and cost £8,000, being a present made by the States of\r\nHolland when his Majesty returned, and had formerly been given by them to\r\nour King's sister, the Princess of Orange, and, being bought of her\r\nagain, was now presented to the King. The great looking-glass and toilet,\r\nof beaten and massive gold, was given by the Queen-Mother. The Queen\r\nbrought over with her from Portugal such Indian cabinets as had never\r\nbefore been seen here. The great hall is a most magnificent room. The\r\nchapel roof excellently fretted and gilt. I was also curious to visit the\r\nwardrobe and tents, and other furniture of state. The park, formerly a\r\nflat and naked piece of ground, now planted with sweet rows of lime\r\ntrees; and the canal for water now near perfected; also the air-park. In\r\nthe garden is a rich and noble fountain, with Sirens, statues, etc., cast\r\nin copper, by Fanelli; but no plenty of water. The cradle-work of horn\r\nbeam in the garden is, for the perplexed twining of the trees, very\r\nobservable. There is a parterre which they call Paradise, in which is a\r\npretty banqueting-house set over a cave, or cellar. All these gardens\r\nmight be exceedingly improved, as being too narrow for such a palace.\r\n\r\n10th June, 1662. I returned to London, and presented my \"History of\r\nChalcography\" (dedicated to Mr. Boyle) to our Society.[72]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 72: See Evelyn's \"Miscellaneous Writings.\"]\r\n\r\n19 June, 1662. I went to Albury, to visit Mr. Henry Howard, soon after he\r\nhad procured the Dukedom to be restored. This gentleman had now\r\ncompounded a debt of £200,000, contracted by his grandfather. I was much\r\nobliged to that great virtuoso, and to this young gentleman, with whom I\r\nstayed a fortnight.\r\n\r\n2d July, 1662. We hunted and killed a buck in the park, Mr. Howard\r\ninviting most of the gentlemen of the country near him.\r\n\r\n3d July, 1662. My wife met me at Woodcot, whither Mr. Howard accompanied\r\nme to see my son John, who had been much brought up among Mr. Howard's\r\nchildren at Arundel House, till, for fear of their perverting him in the\r\nCatholic religion, I was forced to take him home.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n8th July, 1662. To London, to take leave of the Duke and Duchess of\r\nOrmond, going then into Ireland with an extraordinary retinue.\r\n\r\n13th July, 1662. Spent some time with the Lord Chancellor, where I had\r\ndiscourse with my Lord Willoughby, Governor of Barbadoes, concerning\r\ndivers particulars of that colony.\r\n\r\n28th July, 1662. His Majesty going to sea to meet the Queen-Mother, now\r\ncoming again for England, met with such ill weather as greatly endangered\r\nhim. I went to Greenwich, to wait on the Queen, now landed.\r\n\r\n30th July, 1662. To London, where was a meeting about Charitable Uses,\r\nand particularly to inquire how the city had disposed of the revenues of\r\nGresham College, and why the salaries of the professors there were no\r\nbetter improved. I was on this commission, with divers Bishops and Lords\r\nof the Council; but little was the progress we could make.\r\n\r\n31st July, 1662. I sat with the Commissioners about reforming buildings\r\nand streets of London, and we ordered the paving of the way from St.\r\nJames's North, which was a quagmire, and also of the Haymarket about\r\nPiqudillo [Piccadilly], and agreed upon instructions to be printed and\r\npublished for the better keeping the streets clean.\r\n\r\n1st August, 1662. Mr. H. Howard, his brothers Charles, Edward, Bernard,\r\nPhilip,[73] now the Queen's Almoner (all brothers of the Duke of Norfolk,\r\nstill in Italy), came with a great train, and dined with me; Mr. H.\r\nHoward leaving with me his eldest and youngest sons, Henry and Thomas,\r\nfor three or four days, my son, John, having been sometime bred up in\r\ntheir father's house.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 73: Since Cardinal at Rome. \"Evelyn's Note.\"]\r\n\r\n4th August, 1662. Came to see me the old Countess of Devonshire, with\r\nthat excellent and worthy person, my Lord her son, from Roehampton.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n5th August, 1662. To London, and next day to Hampton Court, about my\r\npurchase, and took leave of Sir R. Fanshawe, now going Ambassador to\r\nPortugal.\r\n\r\n13th August, 1662. Our Charter being now passed under the broad Seal,\r\nconstituting us a corporation under the name of the Royal Society for the\r\nimprovement of natural knowledge by experiment, was this day read and was\r\nall that was done this afternoon, being very large.\r\n\r\n14th August, 1662. I sat on the commission for Charitable Uses, the Lord\r\nMayor and others of the Mercers' Company being summoned, to answer some\r\ncomplaints of the Professors, grounded on a clause in the will of Sir\r\nThomas Gresham, the founder.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon, the Queen-Mother, with the Earl of St. Alban's and many\r\ngreat ladies and persons, was pleased to honor my poor villa with her\r\npresence, and to accept of a collation. She was exceedingly pleased, and\r\nstaid till very late in the evening.\r\n\r\n15th August, 1662. Came my Lord Chancellor (the Earl of Clarendon) and\r\nhis lady, his purse and mace borne before him, to visit me. They were\r\nlikewise collationed with us, and were very merry. They had all been our\r\nold acquaintance in exile, and indeed this great person had ever been my\r\nfriend. His son, Lord Cornbury, was here, too.\r\n\r\n17th August, 1662. Being the Sunday when the Common Prayer Book, reformed\r\nand ordered to be used for the future, was appointed to be read, and the\r\nsolemn League and Covenant to be abjured by all the incumbents of England\r\nunder penalty of losing their livings; our vicar read it this morning.\r\n\r\n20th August, 1662. There were strong guards in the city this day,\r\napprehending some tumults, many of the Presbyterian ministers not\r\nconforming. I dined with the Vice-Chamberlain, and then went to see the\r\nQueen-Mother, who was pleased to give me many thanks for the\r\nentertainment she received at my house, when she recounted to me many\r\nobservable stories of the sagacity of some dogs she formerly had.\r\n\r\n21st August, 1662. I was admitted and then sworn one of the Council of\r\nthe Royal Society, being nominated in his Majesty's original grant to be\r\nof this Council for the regulation of the Society, and making laws and\r\nstatutes conducible to its establishment and progress, for which we now\r\nset apart every Wednesday morning till they were all finished. Lord\r\nViscount Brouncker (that excellent mathematician) was also by his\r\nMajesty, our founder, nominated our first President. The King gave us the\r\narms of England to be borne in a canton in our arms, and sent us a mace\r\nof silver gilt, of the same fashion and size as those carried before his\r\nMajesty, to be borne before our president on meeting days. It was brought\r\nby Sir Gilbert Talbot, master of his Majesty's jewel house.\r\n\r\n22d August, 1662. I dined with my Lord Brouncker and Sir Robert Murray,\r\nand then went to consult about a newly modeled ship at Lambeth, the\r\nintention being to reduce that art to as certain a method as any other\r\npart of architecture.\r\n\r\n23d August, 1662. I was spectator of the most magnificent triumph that\r\never floated on the Thames, considering the innumerable boats and\r\nvessels, dressed and adorned with all imaginable pomp, but, above all,\r\nthe thrones, arches, pageants, and other representations, stately barges\r\nof the Lord Mayor and companies, with various inventions, music, and\r\npeals of ordnance both from the vessels and the shore, going to meet and\r\nconduct the new Queen from Hampton Court to Whitehall, at the first time\r\nof her coming to town. In my opinion, it far exceeded all the Venetian\r\nBucentoras, etc., on the Ascension, when they go to espouse the Adriatic.\r\nHis Majesty and the Queen came in an antique-shaped open vessel, covered\r\nwith a state, or canopy, of cloth of gold, made in form of a cupola,\r\nsupported with high Corinthian pillars, wreathed with flowers, festoons\r\nand garlands. I was in our newly built vessel, sailing among them.\r\n\r\n29th August, 1662. The Council and Fellows of the Royal Society went in a\r\nbody to Whitehall, to acknowledge his Majesty's royal grace in granting\r\nour Charter, and vouchsafing to be himself our founder; when the\r\nPresident made an eloquent speech, to which his Majesty gave a gracious\r\nreply and we all kissed his hand. Next day we went in like manner with\r\nour address to my Lord Chancellor, who had much promoted our patent: he\r\nreceived us with extraordinary favor. In the evening I went to the\r\nQueen-Mother's Court, and had much discourse with her.\r\n\r\n1st September, 1662. Being invited by Lord Berkeley, I went to Durdans,\r\nwhere dined his Majesty, the Queen, Duke, Duchess, Prince Rupert, Prince\r\nEdward, and abundance of noblemen. I went, after dinner, to visit my\r\nbrother of Woodcot, my sister having been delivered of a son a little\r\nbefore, but who had now been two days dead.\r\n\r\n4th September, 1662. Commission for Charitable Uses, my Lord Mayor and\r\nAldermen being again summoned, and the improvements of Sir Thomas\r\nGresham's estate examined. There were present the Bishop of London, the\r\nLord Chief Justice, and the King's attorney.\r\n\r\n6th September, 1662. Dined with me Sir Edward Walker, Garter\r\nKing-at-Arms, Mr. Slingsby, master of the Mint, and several others.\r\n\r\n17th September, 1662. We now resolved that the Arms of the Society should\r\nbe a field argent, with a canton of the arms of England; the supporters\r\ntwo talbots argent; crest, an eagle Or holding a shield with the like\r\narms of England, viz, three lions. The words \"_Nullius in verbâ_.\" It was\r\npresented to his Majesty for his approbation, and orders given to Garter\r\nKing-at-Arms to pass the diploma of their office for it.\r\n\r\n20th September, 1662. I presented a petition to his Majesty about my own\r\nconcerns, and afterward accompanied him to Monsieur Febure his chemist\r\n(and who had formerly been my master in Paris), to see his accurate\r\npreparation for the composing Sir Walter Raleigh's rare cordial: he made\r\na learned discourse before his Majesty in French on each ingredient.\r\n\r\n27th September, 1662. Came to visit me Sir George Saville, grandson to\r\nthe learned Sir Henry Saville, who published St. Chrysostom. Sir George\r\nwas a witty gentleman, if not a little too prompt and daring.\r\n\r\n3d October, 1662. I was invited to the College of Physicians, where Dr.\r\nMeret, a learned man and library-keeper, showed me the library, theater\r\nfor anatomy, and divers natural curiosities; the statue and epigram under\r\nit of that renowned physician, Dr. Harvey, discoverer of the circulation\r\nof the blood. There I saw Dr. Gilbert, Sir William Paddy's and other\r\npictures of men famous in their faculty.\r\n\r\nVisited Mr. Wright, a Scotchman, who had lived long at Rome, and was\r\nesteemed a good painter. The pictures of the Judges at Guildhall are of\r\nhis hand, and so are some pieces in Whitehall, as the roof in his\r\nMajesty's old bedchamber, being Astræa, the St. Catherine, and a\r\nchimney-piece in the Queen's privy chamber; but his best, in my opinion,\r\nis Lacy, the famous Roscius or comedian, whom he has painted in three\r\ndresses, as a gallant, a Presbyterian minister, and a Scotch highlander\r\nin his plaid. It is in his Majesty's dining room at Windsor. He had at\r\nhis house an excellent collection, especially that small piece of\r\nCorreggio, Scotus of de la Marca, a design of Paulo; and, above all,\r\nthose ruins of Polydore, with some good agates and medals, especially a\r\nScipio, and a Cæsar's head of gold.\r\n\r\n15th October, 1662. I this day delivered my \"Discourse concerning Forest\r\nTrees\" to the Society, upon occasion of certain queries sent to us by the\r\nCommissioners of his Majesty's Navy, being the first book that was\r\nprinted by order of the Society, and by their printer, since it was a\r\ncorporation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n16th October, 1662. I saw \"_Volpone_\" acted at Court before their\r\nMajesties.\r\n\r\n21st October, 1662. To the Queen-Mother's Court, where her Majesty\r\nrelated to us divers passages of her escapes during the Rebellion and\r\nwars in England.\r\n\r\n28th October, 1662. To Court in the evening where the Queen-Mother, the\r\nQueen-Consort, and his Majesty being advertised of some disturbance,\r\nforbore to go to the Lord Mayor's show and feast appointed next day, the\r\nnew Queen not having yet seen that triumph.\r\n\r\n29th October, 1662. Was my Lord Mayor's show, with a number of sumptuous\r\npageants, speeches, and verses. I was standing in a house in Cheapside\r\nagainst the place prepared for their Majesties. The Prince and heir of\r\nDenmark was there, but not our King. There were also the maids of honor.\r\nI went to Court this evening, and had much discourse with Dr. Basiers,\r\none of his Majesty's chaplains, the great traveler, who showed me the\r\nsyngraphs and original subscriptions of divers eastern patriarchs and\r\nAsian churches to our confession.\r\n\r\n4th November, 1662. I was invited to the wedding of the daughter of Sir\r\nGeorge Carteret (The Treasurer of the Navy and King's Vice-Chamberlain),\r\nmarried to Sir Nicholas Slaning, Knight of the Bath, by the Bishop of\r\nLondon, in the Savoy chapel; after which was an extraordinary feast.\r\n\r\n5th November, 1662. The Council of the Royal Society met to amend the\r\nStatutes, and dined together; afterward meeting at Gresham College, where\r\nwas a discourse suggested by me, concerning planting his Majesty's Forest\r\nof Dean with oak, now so much exhausted of the choicest ship timber in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n20th November, 1662. Dined with the Comptroller, Sir Hugh Pollard;\r\nafterward saw \"The Young Admiral\" acted before the King.\r\n\r\n21st November, 1662. Spent the evening at Court, Sir Kenelm Digby giving\r\nme great thanks for my \"Sylva.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n27th November, 1662. Went to London to see the entrance of the Russian\r\nAmbassador, whom his Majesty ordered to be received with much state, the\r\nEmperor not only having been kind to his Majesty in his distress, but\r\nbanishing all commerce with our nation during the Rebellion.\r\n\r\nFirst, the city companies and trained bands were all in their stations:\r\nhis Majesty's army and guards in great order. His Excellency came in a\r\nvery rich coach, with some of his chief attendants; many of the rest on\r\nhorseback, clad in their vests, after the Eastern manner, rich furs,\r\ncaps, and carrying the presents, some carrying hawks, furs, teeth, bows,\r\netc. It was a very magnificent show.\r\n\r\nI dined with the Master of the Mint, where was old Sir Ralph Freeman;[74]\r\npassing my evening at the Queen-Mother's Court; at night, saw acted \"The\r\nCommittee,\" a ridiculous play of Sir R. Howard, where the mimic, Lacy,\r\nacted the Irish footman to admiration.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 74: Of Betchworth, in Surrey.]\r\n\r\n30th November, 1662. St. Andrew's day. Invited by the Dean of Westminster\r\nto his consecration dinner and ceremony, on his being made Bishop of\r\nWorcester. Dr. Bolton preached in the Abbey Church; then followed the\r\nconsecration by the Bishops of London, Chichester, Winchester, Salisbury,\r\netc. After this, was one of the most plentiful and magnificent dinners\r\nthat in my life I ever saw; it cost near £600 as I was informed. Here\r\nwere the judges, nobility, clergy, and gentlemen innumerable, this Bishop\r\nbeing universally beloved for his sweet and gentle disposition. He was\r\nauthor of those Characters which go under the name of Blount. He\r\ntranslated his late Majesty's \"Icon\" into Latin, was Clerk of his Closet,\r\nChaplain, Dean of Westminster, and yet a most humble, meek, and cheerful\r\nman, an excellent scholar, and rare preacher. I had the honor to be loved\r\nby him. He married me at Paris, during his Majesty's and the Church's\r\nexile. When I took leave of him, he brought me to the cloisters in his\r\nepiscopal habit. I then went to prayers at Whitehall, where I passed that\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n1st December, 1662. Having seen the strange and wonderful dexterity of\r\nthe sliders on the new canal in St. James's Park, performed before their\r\nMajesties by divers gentlemen and others with skates, after the manner of\r\nthe Hollanders, with what swiftness they pass, how suddenly they stop in\r\nfull career upon the ice; I went home by water, but not without exceeding\r\ndifficulty, the Thames being frozen, great flakes of ice encompassing our\r\nboat.\r\n\r\n17th December, 1662, I saw acted before the King \"The Law against\r\nLovers.\"[75]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 75: By Sir William Davenant, a hotch-potch out of \"Measure\r\n    for Measure\" and \"Much Ado about Nothing.\"]\r\n\r\n21st December, 1662. One of his Majesty's chaplains preached; after\r\nwhich, instead of the ancient, grave, and solemn wind music accompanying\r\nthe organ, was introduced a concert of twenty-four violins between every\r\npause, after the French fantastical light way, better suiting a tavern,\r\nor playhouse, than a church. This was the first time of change, and now\r\nwe no more heard the cornet which gave life to the organ; that instrument\r\nquite left off in which the English were so skillful. I dined at Mr.\r\nPovey's, where I talked with Cromer, a great musician.\r\n\r\n23d December, 1662. I went with Sir George Tuke, to hear the comedians\r\ncon and repeat his new comedy, \"The Adventures of Five Hours,\" a play\r\nwhose plot was taken out of the famous Spanish poet, Calderon.\r\n\r\n27th December, 1662. I visited Sir Theophilus Biddulph.\r\n\r\n29th December, 1662. Saw the audience of the Muscovy Ambassador, which\r\nwas with extraordinary state, his retinue being numerous, all clad in\r\nvests of several colors, with buskins, after the Eastern manner! their\r\ncaps of fur; tunics, richly embroidered with gold and pearls, made a\r\nglorious show. The King being seated under a canopy in the Banqueting\r\nHouse, the Secretary of the Embassy went before the Ambassador in a grave\r\nmarch, holding up his master's letters of credence in a crimson taffeta\r\nscarf before his forehead. The Ambassador then delivered it with a\r\nprofound reverence to the King, who gave it to our Secretary of State: it\r\nwas written in a long and lofty style. Then came in the presents, borne\r\nby 165 of his retinue, consisting of mantles and other large pieces lined\r\nwith sable, black fox, and ermine; Persian carpets, the ground cloth of\r\ngold and velvet; hawks, such as they said never came the like; horses\r\nsaid to be Persian; bows and arrows, etc. These borne by so long a train\r\nrendered it very extraordinary. Wind music played all the while in the\r\ngalleries above. This finished, the Ambassador was conveyed by the master\r\nof the ceremonies to York House, where he was treated with a banquet,\r\nwhich cost £200, as I was assured.\r\n\r\n7th January, 1663. At night I saw the ball, in which his Majesty danced\r\nwith several great ladies.\r\n\r\n8th January, 1663. I went to see my kinsman, Sir George Tuke's, comedy\r\nacted at the Duke's theater, which took so universally, that it was acted\r\nfor some weeks every day, and it was believed it would be worth to the\r\ncomedians £400 or £500. The plot was incomparable; but the language stiff\r\nand formal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n10th January, 1663. I saw a ball again at Court, danced by the King, the\r\nDuke, and ladies, in great pomp.\r\n\r\n21st January, 1663. Dined at Mr. Treasurer's, of the Household, Sir\r\nCharles Berkeley's, where were the Earl of Oxford, Lord Bellassis, Lord\r\nGerard, Sir Andrew Scrope, Sir William Coventry, Dr. Fraser, Mr. Windham,\r\nand others.\r\n\r\n5th February, 1663. I saw \"The Wild Gallant,\" a comedy;[76] and was at\r\nthe great ball at Court, where his Majesty, the Queen, etc., danced.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 76: By Dryden. It was unsuccessful on the first\r\n    representation, but was subsequently altered to the form in which it\r\n    now appears.]\r\n\r\n6th February, 1663. Dined at my Lord Mayor's, Sir John Robinson,\r\nLieutenant of the Tower.\r\n\r\n15th February, 1663. This night some villains broke into my house and\r\nstudy below, and robbed me to the value of £60 in plate, money and\r\ngoods:--this being the third time I have been thus plundered.\r\n\r\n26th March, 1663. I sat at the Commission of Sewers, where was a great\r\ncase pleaded by his Majesty's counsel; he having built a wall over a\r\nwater course, denied the jurisdiction of the Court. The verdict went for\r\nthe plaintiff.[77]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 77: That is against the King.]\r\n\r\n30th April, 1663. Came his Majesty to honor my poor villa with his\r\npresence, viewing the gardens, and even every room of the house, and was\r\npleased to take a small refreshment. There were with him the Duke of\r\nRichmond, Earl of St. Alban's, Lord Lauderdale, and several persons of\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n14th May, 1663. Dined with my Lord Mordaunt, and thence went to Barnes,\r\nto visit my excellent and ingenious friend, Abraham Cowley.\r\n\r\n17th May, 1663. I saluted the old Bishop of Durham, Dr. Cosin, to whom I\r\nhad been kind, and assisted in his exile; but which he little remembered\r\nin his greatness.\r\n\r\n29th May, 1663. Dr. Creighton preached his extravagant sermon at St.\r\nMargaret's, before the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n30th May, 1663. This morning was passed my lease of Sayes Court from the\r\nCrown, for the finishing of which I had been obliged to make such\r\nfrequent journeys to London. I returned this evening, having seen the\r\nRussian Ambassador take leave of their Majesties with great solemnity.\r\n\r\n2d July, 1663. I saw the great Masque at Court, and lay that night at\r\nArundel House.\r\n\r\n4th July, 1663. I saw his Majesty's Guards, being of horse and foot\r\n4,000, led by the General, the Duke of Albemarle, in extraordinary\r\nequipage and gallantry, consisting of gentlemen of quality and veteran\r\nsoldiers, excellently clad, mounted, and ordered, drawn up in battalia\r\nbefore their Majesties in Hyde Park, where the old Earl of Cleveland\r\ntrailed a pike, and led the right-hand file in a foot company, commanded\r\nby the Lord Wentworth, his son; a worthy spectacle and example, being\r\nboth of them old and valiant soldiers. This was to show the French\r\nAmbassador, Monsieur Comminges; there being a great assembly of coaches,\r\netc., in the park.\r\n\r\n7th July, 1663. Dined at the Comptroller's; after dinner we met at the\r\nCommission about the streets, and to regulate hackney coaches, also to\r\nmake up our accounts to pass the Exchequer.\r\n\r\n16th July, 1663. A most extraordinary wet and cold season.\r\n\r\nSir George Carteret, Treasurer of the Navy, had now married his daughter,\r\nCaroline, to Sir Thomas Scott, of Scott's Hall, in Kent. This gentleman\r\nwas thought to be the son of Prince Rupert.\r\n\r\n2d August, 1663. This evening I accompanied Mr. Treasurer and\r\nVice-Chamberlain Carteret to his lately married son-in-law's, Sir Thomas\r\nScott, to Scott's Hall. We took barge as far as Gravesend, and thence by\r\npost to Rochester, whence in coach and six horses to Scott's Hall; a\r\nright noble seat, uniformly built, with a handsome gallery. It stands in\r\na park well stored, the land fat and good. We were exceedingly feasted by\r\nthe young knight, and in his pretty chapel heard an excellent sermon by\r\nhis chaplain. In the afternoon, preached the learned Sir Norton\r\nKnatchbull (who has a noble seat hard by, and a plantation of stately fir\r\ntrees). In the churchyard of the parish church I measured an overgrown\r\nyew tree, that was eighteen of my paces in compass, out of some branches\r\nof which, torn off by the winds, were sawed divers goodly planks.\r\n\r\n10th August, 1663. We returned by Sir Norton's, whose house is likewise\r\nin a park. This gentleman is a worthy person, and learned critic,\r\nespecially in Greek and Hebrew. Passing by Chatham, we saw his Majesty's\r\nRoyal Navy, and dined at Commissioner Pett's,[78] master-builder there,\r\nwho showed me his study and models, with other curiosities belonging to\r\nhis art. He is esteemed for the most skillful shipbuilder in the world.\r\nHe hath a pretty garden and banqueting house, pots, statues, cypresses,\r\nresembling some villas about Rome. After a great feast we rode post to\r\nGravesend, and, sending the coach to London, came by barge home that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 78: A monument to him in Deptford Church bears a most\r\n    pompous inscription: \"_Qui fuit patriæ decus, patriæ suæ magnum\r\n    munimentum_;\" to the effect that he had not only restored our naval\r\n    affairs, but he invented that excellent and new ornament of the Navy\r\n    which we call Frigate, formidable to our enemies, to us most useful\r\n    and safe: he was to be esteemed, indeed, by this invention, the Noah\r\n    of his age, which, like another Ark, had snatched from shipwreck our\r\n    rights and our dominion of the seas.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n18th August, 1663. To London, to see my Lord Chancellor, where I had\r\ndiscourse with my Lord Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of\r\nWinchester, who enjoined me to write to Dr. Pierce, President of Magdalen\r\nCollege, Oxford, about a letter sent him by Dr. Goffe, a Romish\r\nOratorian, concerning an answer to Dean Cressy's late book.\r\n\r\n20th August, 1663. I dined at the Comptroller's [of the Household] with\r\nthe Earl of Oxford and Mr. Ashburnham; it was said it should be the last\r\nof the public diets, or tables, at Court, it being determined to put down\r\nthe old hospitality, at which was great murmuring, considering his\r\nMajesty's vast revenue and the plenty of the nation. Hence, I went to sit\r\nin a Committee, to consider about the regulation of the Mint at the\r\nTower; in which some small progress was made.\r\n\r\n27th August, 1663. Dined at Sir Philip Warwick's, Secretary to my Lord\r\nTreasurer, who showed me the accounts and other private matters relating\r\nto the revenue. Thence, to the Commissioners of the Mint, particularly\r\nabout coinage, and bringing his Majesty's rate from fifteen to ten\r\nshillings for every pound weight of gold.\r\n\r\n31st August, 1663. I was invited to the translation of Dr. Sheldon,\r\nBishop of London, from that see to Canterbury, the ceremony performed at\r\nLambeth. First, went his Grace's mace bearer, steward, treasurer,\r\ncomptroller, all in their gowns, and with white staves; next, the bishops\r\nin their habits, eight in number; Dr. Sweate, Dean of the Arches, Dr.\r\nExton, Judge of the Admiralty, Sir William Merick, Judge of the\r\nPrerogative Court, with divers advocates in scarlet. After divine service\r\nin the chapel, performed with music extraordinary, Dr. French and Dr.\r\nStradling (his Grace's chaplains) said prayers. The Archbishop in a\r\nprivate room looking into the chapel, the bishops, who were\r\ncommissioners, went up to a table placed before the altar, and sat round\r\nit in chairs. Then Dr. Chaworth presented the commission under the broad\r\nseal to the Bishop of Winchester, and it was read by Dr. Sweate. After\r\nwhich, the Vicar-General went to the vestry, and brought his Grace into\r\nthe chapel, his other officers marching before. He being presented to the\r\nCommissioners, was seated in a great armchair at one end of the table,\r\nwhen the definitive sentence was read by the Bishop of Winchester, and\r\nsubscribed by all the bishops, and proclamation was three times made at\r\nthe chapel door, which was then set open for any to enter, and give their\r\nexceptions; if any they had. This done, we all went to dinner in the\r\ngreat hall to a mighty feast. There were present all the nobility in\r\ntown, the Lord Mayor of London, Sheriffs, Duke of Albemarle, etc. My Lord\r\nArchbishop did in particular most civilly welcome me. So going to visit\r\nmy Lady Needham, who lived at Lambeth, I went over to London.\r\n\r\n10th September, 1663. I dined with Mr. Treasurer of the Navy, where,\r\nsitting by Mr. Secretary Morice, we had much discourse about books and\r\nauthors, he being a learned man, and had a good collection.\r\n\r\n24th October, 1663. Mr. Edward Phillips came to be my son's preceptor:\r\nthis gentleman was nephew to Milton, who wrote against Salmasius's\r\n\"_Defensio_\"; but was not at all infected with his principles, though\r\nbrought up by him.\r\n\r\n5th November, 1663. Dr. South, my Lord Chancellor's chaplain, preached at\r\nWestminster Abbey an excellent discourse concerning obedience to\r\nmagistrates, against the pontificians and sectaries. I afterward dined at\r\nSir Philip Warwick's, where was much company.\r\n\r\n6th November, 1663. To Court, to get Sir John Evelyn, of Godstone, off\r\nfrom being Sheriff of Surrey.\r\n\r\n30th November, 1663. Was the first anniversary of our Society for the\r\nchoice of new officers, according to the tenor of our patent and\r\ninstitution. It being St. Andrew's day, who was our patron, each fellow\r\nwore a St. Andrew's cross of ribbon on the crown of his hat.

To Barn Elms, to see Abraham Cowley after his\r\nsickness; and returned that evening to London.\r\n\r\n4th February, 1664. Dined at Sir Philip Warwick's; thence, to Court,\r\nwhere I had discourse with the King about an invention of glass-grenades,\r\nand several other subjects.\r\n\r\n5th February, 1664. I saw \"The Indian Queen\" acted, a tragedy well\r\nwritten,[79] so beautiful with rich scenes as the like had never been\r\nseen here, or haply (except rarely) elsewhere on a mercenary theater.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 79: By Sir Robert Howard and Dryden.]\r\n\r\n16th February, 1664. I presented my \"Sylva\" to the Society; and next day\r\nto his Majesty, to whom it was dedicated; also to the Lord Treasurer and\r\nthe Lord Chancellor.\r\n\r\n24th February, 1664. My Lord George Berkeley, of Durdans, and Sir Samuel\r\nTuke came to visit me. We went on board Sir William Petty's\r\ndouble-bottomed vessel, and so to London.\r\n\r\n26th February, 1664.

I went to the Tower, to sit in commission about\r\nregulating the Mint; and now it was that the fine new-milled coin, both\r\nof white money and guineas, was established.\r\n\r\n26th March, 1664. It pleased God to take away my son, Richard, now a\r\nmonth old, yet without any sickness of danger perceivably, being to all\r\nappearance a most likely child; we suspected much the nurse had overlain\r\nhim; to our extreme sorrow, being now again reduced to one: but God's\r\nwill be done.\r\n\r\n29th March, 1664. After evening prayers, was my child buried near the\r\nrest of his brothers--my very dear children.\r\n\r\n27th April, 1664.

To our Society, to which his Majesty had sent that\r\nwonderful horn of the fish which struck a dangerous hole in the keel of a\r\nship in the India sea, which, being broken off with the violence of the\r\nfish, and left in the timber, preserved it from foundering.\r\n\r\n9th June, 1664. Sir Samuel Tuke[80] being this morning married to a lady,\r\nkinswoman to my Lord Arundel of Wardour, by the Queen's Lord Almoner, L.\r\nAubigny in St. James's chapel, solemnized his wedding night at my house\r\nwith much company.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 80: A Roman Catholic.]\r\n\r\n22d June, 1664. One Tomson, a Jesuit, showed me such a collection of\r\nrarities, sent from the Jesuits of Japan and China to their Order at\r\nParis, as a present to be reserved in their repository, but brought to\r\nLondon by the East India ships for them, as in my life I had not seen.\r\nThe chief things were, rhinoceros's horns; glorious vests, wrought and\r\nembroidered on cloth of gold, but with such lively colors, that for\r\nsplendor and vividness we have nothing in Europe that approaches it; a\r\ngirdle studded with agates and rubies of great value and size; knives, of\r\nso keen an edge as one could not touch them, nor was the metal of our\r\ncolor, but more pale and livid; fans, like those our ladies use, but much\r\nlarger, and with long handles curiously carved and filled with Chinese\r\ncharacters; a sort of paper very broad, thin, and fine, like abortive\r\nparchment, and exquisitely polished, of an amber yellow, exceedingly\r\nglorious and pretty to look on, and seeming to be like that which my\r\nLord Verulam describes in his \"_Nova Atlantis_\"; several other sorts of\r\npaper, some written, others printed; prints of landscapes, their idols,\r\nsaints, pagods, of most ugly serpentine monstrous and hideous shapes, to\r\nwhich they paid devotion; pictures of men and countries, rarely painted\r\non a sort of gummed calico, transparent as glass; flowers, trees, beasts,\r\nbirds, etc., excellently wrought in a kind of sleeve silk, very natural;\r\ndivers drugs that our druggists and physicians could make nothing of,\r\nespecially one which the Jesuit called _Lac Tigridis_: it looked like a\r\nfungus, but was weighty like metal, yet was a concretion, or coagulation,\r\nof some other matter; several book MSS.; a grammar of the language\r\nwritten in Spanish; with innumerable other rarities.\r\n\r\n1st July, 1664. Went to see Mr. Povey's elegant house in Lincoln's-Inn\r\nFields, where the perspective in his court, painted by Streeter, is\r\nindeed excellent, with the vases in imitation of porphyry, and fountains;\r\nthe inlaying of his closet; above all, his pretty cellar and ranging of\r\nhis wine bottles.\r\n\r\n7th July, 1664. To Court, where I subscribed to Sir Arthur Slingsby's\r\nlottery, a desperate debt owing me long since in Paris.\r\n\r\n14th July, 1664. I went to take leave of the two Mr. Howards, now going\r\nto Paris, and brought them as far as Bromley; thence to Eltham, to see\r\nSir John Shaw's new house, now building; the place is pleasant, if not\r\ntoo wet, but the house not well contrived; especially the roof and rooms\r\ntoo low pitched, and the kitchen where the cellars should be; the\r\norangery and aviary handsome, and a very large plantation about it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n19th July, 1664. To London, to see the event of the lottery which his\r\nMajesty had permitted Sir Arthur Slingsby to set up for one day in the\r\nBanqueting House, at Whitehall; I gaining only a trifle, as well as did\r\nthe King, Queen-Consort, and Queen-Mother, for near thirty lots; which\r\nwas thought to be contrived very unhandsomely by the master of it, who\r\nwas, in truth, a mere shark.\r\n\r\n21st July, 1664. I dined with my Lord Treasurer at Southampton House,\r\nwhere his Lordship used me with singular humanity. I went in the\r\nafternoon to Chelsea, to wait on the Duke of Ormond, and returned to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n28th July, 1664. Came to see me Monsieur Zuylichen, Secretary to the\r\nPrince of Orange, an excellent Latin poet, a rare lutinist, with Monsieur\r\nOudart.\r\n\r\n3d August, 1664. To London; a concert of excellent musicians, especially\r\none Mr. Berkenshaw, that rare artist, who invented a mathematical way of\r\ncomposure very extraordinary, true as to the exact rules of art, but\r\nwithout much harmony.\r\n\r\n8th August, 1664. Came the sad and unexpected news of the death of Lady\r\nCotton, wife to my brother George, a most excellent lady.\r\n\r\n9th August, 1664. Went with my brother Richard to Wotton, to visit and\r\ncomfort my disconsolate brother; and on the 13th saw my friend, Mr.\r\nCharles Howard, at Dipden, near Dorking.\r\n\r\n16th August, 1664. I went to see Sir William Ducie's house at Charlton;\r\nwhich he purchased of my excellent friend, Sir Henry Newton, now nobly\r\nfurnished.\r\n\r\n22d August, 1664. I went from London to Wotton, to assist at the funeral\r\nof my sister-in-law, the Lady Cotton, buried in our dormitory there, she\r\nbeing put up in lead. Dr. Owen made a profitable and pathetic discourse,\r\nconcluding with an eulogy of that virtuous, pious, and deserving lady. It\r\nwas a very solemn funeral, with about fifty mourners. I came back next\r\nday with my wife to London.\r\n\r\n2d September, 1664. Came Constantine Huygens, Signor de Zuylichen, Sir\r\nRobert Morris, Mr. Oudart, Mr. Carew, and other friends, to spend the day\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\n5th October, 1664. To our Society. There was brought a newly-invented\r\ninstrument of music, being a harpsichord with gut-strings, sounding like\r\na concert of viols with an organ, made vocal by a wheel, and a zone of\r\nparchment that rubbed horizontally against the strings.\r\n\r\n6th October, 1664. I heard the anniversary oration in praise of Dr.\r\nHarvey, in the Anatomy Theatre in the College of Physicians; after which\r\nI was invited by Dr. Alston, the President, to a magnificent feast.\r\n\r\n7th October, 1664. I dined at Sir Nicholas Strood's, one of the Masters\r\nof Chancery, in Great St. Bartholomew's; passing the evening at\r\nWhitehall, with the Queen, etc.\r\n\r\n8th October, 1664. Sir William Curtius, his Majesty's Resident in\r\nGermany, came to visit me; he was a wise and learned gentleman, and, as\r\nhe told me, scholar to Henry Alstedius, the Encyclopedist.\r\n\r\n15th October, 1664. Dined at the Lord Chancellor's, where was the Duke of\r\nOrmond, Earl of Cork, and Bishop of Winchester. After dinner, my Lord\r\nChancellor and his lady carried me in their coach to see their palace\r\n(for he now lived at Worcester-House in the Strand), building at the\r\nupper end of St. James's street, and to project the garden. In the\r\nevening, I presented him with my book on Architecture,[81] as before I\r\nhad done to his Majesty and the Queen-Mother. His lordship caused me to\r\nstay with him in his bedchamber, discoursing of several matters very\r\nlate, even till he was going into his bed.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 81: \"Parallel between Ancient and Modern Architecture,\r\n    originally written in French, by Roland Freart, Sieur de Chambray,\"\r\n    and translated by Evelyn. See his \"Miscellaneous Writings.\"]\r\n\r\n17th October, 1664. I went with my Lord Viscount Cornbury, to Cornbury,\r\nin Oxfordshire, to assist him in the planting of the park, and bear him\r\ncompany, with Mr. Belin and Mr. May, in a coach with six horses; dined at\r\nUxbridge, lay at Wycombe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OXFORD]\r\n\r\n18th October, 1664. At Oxford. Went through Woodstock, where we beheld\r\nthe destruction of that royal seat and park by the late rebels, and\r\narrived that evening at Cornbury, a house lately built by the Earl of\r\nDenbigh, in the middle of a sweet park, walled with a dry wall. The house\r\nis of excellent freestone, abounding in that part, (a stone that is fine,\r\nbut never sweats, or casts any damp); it is of ample dimensions, has\r\ngoodly cellars, the paving of the hall admirable for its close laying. We\r\ndesigned a handsome chapel that was yet wanting: as Mr. May had the\r\nstables, which indeed are very fair, having set out the walks in the\r\nparks and gardens. The lodge is a pretty solitude, and the ponds very\r\nconvenient; the park well stored.\r\n\r\n20th October, 1664. Hence, to see the famous wells, natural and\r\nartificial grots and fountains, called Bushell's Wells, at Enstone. This\r\nBushell had been Secretary to my Lord Verulam. It is an extraordinary\r\nsolitude. There he had two mummies; a grot where he lay in a hammock,\r\nlike an Indian. Hence, we went to Dichley, an ancient seat of the Lees,\r\nnow Sir Henry Lee's; it is a low ancient timber-house, with a pretty\r\nbowling-green. My Lady gave us an extraordinary dinner. This gentleman's\r\nmother was Countess of Rochester, who was also there, and Sir Walter St.\r\nJohn. There were some pictures of their ancestors, not ill painted; the\r\ngreat-grandfather had been Knight of the Garter; there was a picture of a\r\nPope, and our Savior's head. So we returned to Cornbury.\r\n\r\n24th October, 1664. We dined at Sir Timothy Tyrill's at Shotover. This\r\ngentleman married the daughter and heir of Dr. James Usher, Archbishop of\r\nArmagh, that learned prelate. There is here in the grove a fountain of\r\nthe coldest water I ever felt, and very clear. His plantation of oaks and\r\nother timber is very commendable. We went in the evening to Oxford, lay\r\nat Dr. Hyde's, principal of Magdalen-Hall (related to the Lord\r\nChancellor), brother to the Lord Chief Justice and that Sir Henry Hyde,\r\nwho lost his head for his loyalty. We were handsomely entertained two\r\ndays. The Vice-Chancellor, who with Dr. Fell, Dean of Christ Church, the\r\nlearned Dr. Barlow, Warden of Queen's, and several heads of houses, came\r\nto visit Lord Cornbury (his father being now Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity), and next day invited us all to dinner. I went to visit Mr.\r\nBoyle (now here), whom I found with Dr. Wallis and Dr. Christopher Wren,\r\nin the tower of the schools, with an inverted tube, or telescope,\r\nobserving the discus of the sun for the passing of Mercury that day\r\nbefore it; but the latitude was so great that nothing appeared; so we\r\nwent to see the rarities in the library, where the keepers showed me my\r\nname among the benefactors. They have a cabinet of some medals, and\r\npictures of the muscular parts of man's body. Thence, to the new theater,\r\nnow building at an exceeding and royal expense by the Lord Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury [Sheldon], to keep the Acts in for the future, till now being\r\nin St. Mary's Church. The foundation had been newly laid, and the whole\r\ndesigned by that incomparable genius my worthy friend, Dr. Christopher\r\nWren, who showed me the model, not disdaining my advice in some\r\nparticulars. Thence, to see the picture on the wall over the altar of All\r\nSouls, being the largest piece of fresco painting (or rather in imitation\r\nof it, for it is in oil of turpentine) in England, not ill designed by\r\nthe hand of one Fuller; yet I fear it will not hold long. It seems too\r\nfull of nakeds for a chapel.\r\n\r\nThence, to New College, and the painting of Magdalen chapel, which is on\r\nblue cloth in _chiar oscuro_, by one Greenborow, being a _Coena\r\nDomini_, and a \"Last Judgment\" on the wall by Fuller, as in the other,\r\nbut somewhat varied.\r\n\r\nNext to Wadham, and the Physic Garden, where were two large locust trees,\r\nand as many platani (plane trees), and some rare plants under the culture\r\nof old Bobart.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n26th October, 1664. We came back to Beaconsfield; next day to London,\r\nwhere we dined at the Lord Chancellor's, with my Lord Bellasis.\r\n\r\n27th October, 1664. Being casually in the privy gallery at Whitehall, his\r\nMajesty gave me thanks before divers lords and noblemen for my book of\r\n\"Architecture,\" and again for my \"_Sylva_\" saying they were the best\r\ndesigned and useful for the matter and subject, the best printed and\r\ndesigned (meaning the _taille-douces_ of the Parallel of Architecture)\r\nthat he had seen. He then caused me to follow him alone to one of the\r\nwindows, and asked me if I had any paper about me unwritten, and a\r\ncrayon; I presented him with both, and then laying it on the\r\nwindow-stool, he with his own hands designed to me the plot for the\r\nfuture building of Whitehall, together with the rooms of state, and other\r\nparticulars. After this, he talked with me of several matters, asking my\r\nadvice, in which I find his Majesty had an extraordinary talent becoming\r\na magnificent prince.\r\n\r\nThe same day at Council, there being Commissioners to be made to take\r\ncare of such sick and wounded and prisoners of war, as might be expected\r\nupon occasion of a succeeding war and action at sea, war being already\r\ndeclared against the Hollanders, his Majesty was pleased to nominate me\r\nto be one, with three other gentlemen, Parliament men, viz, Sir William\r\nDoily, Knt. and Bart., Sir Thomas Clifford, and Bullein Rheymes, Esq.;\r\nwith a salary of £1,200 a year among us, besides extraordinaries for our\r\ncare and attention in time of station, each of us being appointed to a\r\nparticular district, mine falling out to be Kent and Sussex, with power\r\nto constitute officers, physicians, chirurgeons, provost-marshals, and to\r\ndispose of half of the hospitals through England. After the Council, we\r\nkissed his Majesty's hand. At this Council I heard Mr. Solicitor Finch\r\nplead most elegantly for the merchants trading to the Canaries, praying\r\nfor a new Charter.\r\n\r\n29th October, 1664. Was the most magnificent triumph by water and land of\r\nthe Lord Mayor. I dined at Guildhall at the upper table, placed next to\r\nSir H. Bennett, Secretary of State, opposite to my Lord Chancellor and\r\nthe Duke of Buckingham, who sat between Monsieur Comminges, the French\r\nAmbassador, Lord Treasurer, the Dukes of Ormond and Albemarle, Earl of\r\nManchester, Lord Chamberlain, and the rest of the great officers of\r\nstate. My Lord Mayor came twice up to us, first drinking in the golden\r\ngoblet his Majesty's health, then the French King's as a compliment to\r\nthe Ambassador; we returned my Lord Mayor's health, the trumpets and\r\ndrums sounding. The cheer was not to be imagined for the plenty and\r\nrarity, with an infinite number of persons at the tables in that ample\r\nhall. The feast was said to cost £1,000. I slipped away in the crowd, and\r\ncame home late.\r\n\r\n31st October, 1664. I was this day 44 years of age; for which I returned\r\nthanks to Almighty God, begging his merciful protection for the year to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n2d November, 1664. Her Majesty, the Queen-Mother, came across the gallery\r\nin Whitehall to give me thanks for my book of \"Architecture,\" which I had\r\npresented to her, with a compliment that I did by no means deserve.\r\n\r\n16th November, 1664. We chose our treasurer, clerks, and messengers, and\r\nappointed our seal, which I ordered should be the good Samaritan, with\r\nthis motto, \"_Fac similiter_.\" Painters' Hall was lent us to meet in. In\r\nthe great room were divers pictures, some reasonably good, that had been\r\ngiven to the Company by several of the wardens and masters of the\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\n23d November, 1664. Our statutes now finished, were read before a full\r\nassembly of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\n24th November, 1664. His Majesty was pleased to tell me what the\r\nconference was with the Holland Ambassador, which, as after I found, was\r\nthe heads of the speech he made at the reconvention of the Parliament,\r\nwhich now began.\r\n\r\n2d December, 1664. We delivered the Privy Council's letters to the\r\nGovernors of St. Thomas's Hospital, in Southwark, that a moiety of the\r\nhouse should be reserved for such sick and wounded as should from time to\r\ntime be sent from the fleet during the war. This being delivered at their\r\nCourt, the President and several Aldermen, Governors of that Hospital,\r\ninvited us to a great feast in Fishmongers' Hall.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON]\r\n\r\n20th December, 1664. To London, our last sitting, taking order for our\r\npersonal visiting our several districts. I dined at Captain Cocke's (our\r\ntreasurer), with that most ingenious gentleman, Matthew Wren, son to the\r\nBishop of Ely, and Mr. Joseph Williamson, since Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n22d December, 1664. I went to the launching of a new ship of two bottoms,\r\ninvented by Sir William Petty, on which were various opinions; his\r\nMajesty being present, gave her the name of the \"Experiment\": so I\r\nreturned home, where I found Sir Humphry Winch, who spent the day with\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThis year I planted the lower grove next the pond at Sayes Court. It was\r\nnow exceedingly cold, and a hard, long, frosty season, and the comet was\r\nvery visible.\r\n\r\n28th December, 1664. Some of my poor neighbors dined with me, and others\r\nof my tenants, according to my annual custom.\r\n\r\n31st December, 1664. Set my affairs in order, gave God praise for His\r\nmercies the past year, and prepared for the reception of the Holy\r\nSacrament, which I partook of the next day, after hearing our minister on\r\nthe 4th of Galatians, verses 4, 5, of the mystery of our Blessed Savior's\r\nIncarnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note\r\n\r\n\r\nPage headers in the original text indicated the location of the author.\r\nI have converted these to sidenotes.
