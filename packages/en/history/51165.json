The Royal Regiment of Artillery: comprising (Mar. 1900).\r\n      (1) Horse Artillery (27 Batteries).\r\n      (2) Field Artillery (121 Batteries).\r\n      (3) Mountain Artillery (10 Batteries).\r\n      (4) Garrison Artillery (83 Batteries); with\r\n      (5) Artillery Militia: also incorporated.\r\n      (6) The Royal Malta Artillery.\r\n      (7) The (late) Bengal Artillery.\r\n      (8) The (late) Madras Artillery.\r\n      (9) The (late) Bombay Artillery.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL CAMPAIGNS, BATTLES, &c.\r\n\r\nOne arm or other of this branch of the Service has, obviously,\r\ntaken part in every campaign: a particularised list is therefore\r\nunnecessary. The guns are the \"Colours\" of the Artillery, and as such\r\nare entitled to all \"parade honours.\" Formerly, regimental honours\r\nappear to have been worn by certain companies. Amongst such were\r\n\"Niagara,\" \"Leipsic,\" \"Waterloo,\" and \"The Dragon of China.\"\r\n\r\n  UNIFORM.--Blue with Scarlet facings. Plume, White.\r\n\r\n  REGIMENTAL BADGES.--The Royal Arms and Supporters, with a Cannon.\r\n  The mottoes, \"_Ubique_\" (Everywhere) over, and \"_Quo fas et glori\r\n  ducunt_\" (\"Whither Right and Glory lead us\") under the gun.\r\n\r\n  NICKNAMES.--\"The Gunners;\" \"The Four-wheeled Hussars\" (of the\r\n  Royal Horse Artillery).\r\n\r\n  NOTES.--Trains of artillery seem first to have been raised in the\r\n  time of Henry VIII.; and up to 1716 appear to have been disbanded\r\n  after each campaign. In 1716 several companies received permanent\r\n  corporate existence, since which the exigencies of modern warfare\r\n  have led to an enormous increase in the number of batteries. But,\r\n  from first to last the record of the Royal Artillery has been one\r\n  of distinction, and it may fitly be said to share the honours of\r\n  all other regiments. The Royal Irish Artillery were absorbed in\r\n  1801, and the East India Company's Artillery in 1858.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--_History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery._\r\n  Compiled from the original Records.

For gallantry at Tongres it\r\n  received its title in 1703; also possibly its _second_ motto\r\n  (\"Even the Remnant Triumph\"), a most desperate resistance of\r\n  twenty-eight hours' duration having there been offered to the\r\n  French attack. The other motto (\"Mindful of Ancient Valour\") is\r\n  thought to refer to Marlborough's Spanish campaigns, in which\r\n  it saw much service, besides having been specially selected for\r\n  reinforcements.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--_Historical Record of the 2nd, or Queen's Royal\r\n  Regiment of Foot_ 1661-1837.

Also (in each of the\r\n  four corners) the Royal Cypher ensigned with the Imperial Crown.\r\n  Also \"The Sphinx\" (for Egypt, 1801).\r\n\r\n  NOTES.--The 1st Battalion of this famous corps, the oldest\r\n  Highland regiment in the British army, was raised (_circa_\r\n  1725-29) from six Independent companies of Highlanders. Its\r\n  sombre dress of black, blue, and green tartan gave rise to its\r\n  popular name. To enumerate its services is simply to narrate the\r\n  military history of Great Britain since the early part of the\r\n  last century. Hardly a campaign has been conducted, or a battle\r\n  fought, in which the Black Watch--one battalion or the other,\r\n  or both in company--has not participated; always with bravery,\r\n  and frequently with conspicuous gallantry. Thereto its record\r\n  of services abundantly testifies. At Fontenoy, Ticonderoga, and\r\n  at Bushy Run \"extraordinary\" and \"unexampled\" gallantry was\r\n  shown. It received Royal distinction in its change of title in\r\n  1758, and was privileged to wear the red heckle in the bonnet,\r\n  in recognition of its conduct at the battle of Guildermalsen in\r\n  1795. In Egypt (in 1801, for which it bears \"The Sphinx\"), before\r\n  Alexandria, it captured the Standard of the French Invincible\r\n  Legion. Since then it has heaped fame on fame, and added \"honour\"\r\n  to \"honour\" to its Colours. Nor has the 2nd Battalion (raised\r\n  in Perthshire in 1758 as the 2nd Battalion of the 42nd, but,\r\n  renumbered, long known as the 73rd prior to the territorial\r\n  restoration of the ancient status) failed to win fresh laurels\r\n  as occasion arose. At Mangalore (1783) against Tippoo Sahib,\r\n  and side by side with the senior battalion at Waterloo, in\r\n  the Netherlands, in the Indian Mutiny, and in the Kaffir wars\r\n  of 1846-53, it has worthily sustained the undying fame of the\r\n  regiment. Recent events in South Africa show that neither the\r\n  officers nor the men of to-day have lost one iota of that\r\n  traditional dash, determination, and bravery which have won for\r\n  the Black Watch so glorious a place in British military annals.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--_Historical Record of the 42nd, or Royal Highland\r\n  Regiment of Foot._ 1729-1844.

The same battalion contributed\r\n  \"Assaye\" (with \"The Elephant\"). It is recorded that in this\r\n  battle \"Every officer present, save one, was killed or wounded,\r\n  and the battalion reduced to a mere wreck.\" \"Assaye\" is an honour\r\n  shared only with The Seaforths and The 19th Hussars. For its\r\n  services in India the Honourable East India Company presented it\r\n  (1803) with a complimentary Colour. Henceforward honours fell\r\n  thick and fast on both battalions--at the Cape, particularly\r\n  so throughout the Peninsula campaign, in the Kaffir wars of\r\n  1851-53 (a large draft of its men went down in the ill-fated\r\n  _Birkenhead_), at the Crimea, in the Indian Mutiny, and more\r\n  latterly in the Egyptian campaigns of the eighties.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--_Historical Record of The 71st Regiment Highland\r\n  Light Infantry._ 1777-1852.

Borne by the Ross-shire Buffs\r\n  from the first: officially recognised in 1825. (2) _Caber Feidh_\r\n  (The Antlers of the Deer), the Seaforth slogan; and (3) _Tulloch\r\n  ard_ (The High Hill), the old gathering-ground of the Mackenzies\r\n  on Loch Duich in Ross-shire.\r\n\r\n  NICKNAMES.--(1) \"The Regiment of the Macraes\" (from the large\r\n  proportion of men of this name in the 72nd when raised); also\r\n  (2) \"The Wild Macraes\" (when in Edinburgh their doings seriously\r\n  frightened the inhabitants); (3) \"The King's Men\" (from the\r\n  ancient motto of the 78th, \"Help, to the King\").\r\n\r\n  NOTES, &C.--Both Batts. are successors of the old 78th (Highland)\r\n  Regiment of Foot--Fraser's Highlanders--which saw much service\r\n  under General Wolfe; disbanded in 1763. The second 78th was\r\n  raised in 1778 by Kenneth Mackenzie, Earl of Seaforth, was\r\n  renumbered as the 72nd in 1786, and is the direct ancestor of the\r\n  present 1st Seaforth Highlanders. Seven years later the present\r\n  2nd Seaforth Highlanders were raised as The 78th (Highland)\r\n  Regiment of Foot, being also known, shortly afterwards, as the\r\n  Ross-shire Buffs. The combined battle-roll of honour is much the\r\n  same as that of the Black Watch and the Argyll and Sutherland\r\n  Highlanders. \"Assaye\" (in 1803) was specially recognised by the\r\n  Honourable East India Company presenting honorary colours to the\r\n  late 78th (2nd Batt.). Half a century later, during the Mutiny,\r\n  it rendered unparalleled service under Havelock, Outram, and\r\n  Clive, adding \"Lucknow\" to the Colours, while its achievements in\r\n  \"Central India,\" \"Afghanistan,\" \"Kabul,\" \"Kandahar,\" \"Egypt,\" and\r\n  \"Tel-el-Kebir\" are well within living memory.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--_Historical Records of The 72nd Regiment, or Duke\r\n  of Albany's Own Highlanders._ 1778-1848.

Fifty years later it again fought in\r\n  India through the Mutiny. During this period the 2nd Batt., as\r\n  the late 92nd, was distinguishing itself in Holland, in Egypt\r\n  (with special distinction at Mandora), and particularly in the\r\n  Peninsula Campaigns of 1809-14, no less than seven \"honours\"\r\n  falling to its share. Fresh laurels were won at Quatre Bras in\r\n  company with the Black Watch and the Royal Scots. Of its later\r\n  exploits only the barest mention can be made--of its services\r\n  in the Indian Mutiny, in Afghanistan (1878-80), including Kabul\r\n  and the march to Kandahar and the rest--the emblazonments on the\r\n  \"Colours\" tell a sufficiently emphatic story.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--_Historical Record of the 92nd Regiment (Gordon\r\n  Highlanders)._ 1794-1850.

Little need to dwell on its prowess. Who\r\n  amongst us does not remember, or who has not read of that \"thin\r\n  red line\" drawn up by Colin Campbell to resist the onslaught of\r\n  the Russian Horse at Balaclava; how the 93rd stood their ground,\r\n  successfully stemming and finally repulsing that memorable\r\n  charge; how it alone of all regiments of foot enjoys the proud\r\n  distinction of \"Balaclava\" on its \"colours\"? And surely there is\r\n  still less need to tell how a few months later, in the Mutiny,\r\n  and especially at Lucknow, this famous corps added new and\r\n  undying laurels to its regimental record--a record which is in\r\n  the memory or ken of all.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--_Historical Records of The 91st Argyllshire\r\n  Highlanders (now the 1st Battalion Argyll and Sutherland\r\n  Highlanders)._ From the formation of the Regiment in 1794 to\r\n  1881.
