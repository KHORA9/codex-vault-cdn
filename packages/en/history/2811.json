Bosanquet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGAIUS PLINIUS CAECILIUS SECUNDUS, usually known as Pliny the Younger,\r\nwas born at Como in 62 A. D. He was only eight years old when his father\r\nCaecilius died, and he was adopted by his uncle, the elder Pliny, author\r\nof the Natural History. He was carefully educated, studying rhetoric\r\nunder Quintilian and other famous teachers, and he became the most\r\neloquent pleader of his time. In this and in much else he imitated\r\nCicero, who had by this time come to be the recognized master of Latin\r\nstyle. While still young he served as military tribune in Syria, but he\r\ndoes not seem to have taken zealously to a soldier's life. On his return\r\nhe entered politics under the Emperor Domitian; and in the year 100 A.\r\nD. was appointed consul by Trajan and admitted to confidential\r\nintercourse with that emperor. Later while he was governor of Bithynia,\r\nhe was in the habit of submitting every point of policy to his master,\r\nand the correspondence between Trajan and him, which forms the last part\r\nof the present selection, is of a high degree of interest, both on\r\naccount of the subjects discussed and for the light thrown on the\r\ncharacters of the two men. He is supposed to have died about 113 A. D.\r\nPliny's speeches are now lost, with the exception of one, a panegyric on\r\nTrajan delivered in thanksgiving for the consulate. This, though diffuse\r\nand somewhat too complimentary for modern taste, became a model for this\r\nkind of composition. The others were mostly of two classes, forensic and\r\npolitical, many of the latter being, like Cicero's speech against\r\nVerres, impeachments of provincial governors for cruelty and extortion\r\ntoward their subjects. In these, as in his public activities in general,\r\nhe appears as a man of public spirit and integrity; and in his relations\r\nwith his native town he was a thoughtful and munificent benefactor.\r\n\r\nThe letters, on which to-day his fame mainly rests, were largely written\r\nwith a view to publication, and were arranged by Pliny himself. They\r\nthus lack the spontaneity of Cicero's impulsive utterances, but to most\r\nmodern readers who are not special students of Roman history they are\r\neven more interesting. They deal with a great variety of subjects: the\r\ndescription of a Roman villa; the charms of country life; the reluctance\r\nof people to attend author's readings and to listen when they were\r\npresent; a dinner party; legacy-hunting in ancient Rome; the acquisition\r\nof a piece of statuary; his love for his young wife; ghost stories;\r\nfloating islands, a tame dolphin, and other marvels. But by far the best\r\nknown are those describing the great eruption of Vesuvius in which his\r\nuncle perished, a martyr to scientific curiosity, and the letter to\r\nTrajan on his attempts to suppress Christianity in Bithynia, with\r\nTrajan's reply approving his policy. Taken altogether, these letters\r\ngive an absorbingly vivid picture of the days of the early empire, and\r\nof the interests of a cultivated Roman gentleman of wealth.\r\nOccasionally, as in the last letters referred to, they deal with\r\nimportant historical events; but their chief value is in bringing before\r\nus, in somewhat the same manner as \"The Spectator\" pictures the England\r\nof the age of Anne, the life of a time which is not so unlike our own as\r\nits distance in years might indicate. And in this time by no means the\r\nleast interesting figure is that of the letter-writer himself, with his\r\nvanity and self-importance, his sensibility and generous affection, his\r\npedantry and his loyalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS GAIUS PLINIUS CAECILIUS SECUNDUS\r\n\r\nI -- To SEPTITTUS\r\n\r\nII -- To ARRIANUS\r\n\r\nIII -- To VOCONIUS ROMANUS\r\n\r\nIV -- To

EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS GAIUS PLINIUS CAECILIUS SECUNDUS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI -- To SEPTITTUS\r\n\r\nYOU have frequently pressed me to make a select collection of my Letters\r\n(if there really be any deserving of a special preference) and give them\r\nto the public. I have selected them accordingly; not, indeed, in their\r\nproper order of time, for I was not compiling a history; but just as\r\neach came to hand. And now I have only to wish that you may have no\r\nreason to repent of your advice, nor I of my compliance: in that case, I\r\nmay probably enquire after the rest, which at present be neglected, and\r\npreserve those I shall hereafter write. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII -- To ARRIANUS\r\n\r\nI FORESEE your journey in my direction is likely to be delayed, and\r\ntherefore send you the speech which I promised in my former; requesting\r\nyou, as usual, to revise and correct it. I desire this the more\r\nearnestly as I never, I think, wrote with the same empressment in any of\r\nmy former speeches; for I have endeavoured to imitate your old favourite\r\nDemosthenes and Calvus, who is lately become mine, at least in the\r\nrhetorical forms of the speech; for to catch their sublime spirit, is\r\ngiven, alone, to the \"inspired few.\" My subject, indeed, seemed\r\nnaturally to lend itself to this (may I venture to call it?) emulation;\r\nconsisting, as it did, almost entirely in a vehement style of address,\r\neven to a degree sufficient to have awakened me (if only I am capable of\r\nbeing awakened) out of that indolence in which I have long reposed. I\r\nhave not however altogether neglected the flowers of rhetoric of my\r\nfavourite Marc-Tully, wherever I could with propriety step out of my\r\ndirect road, to enjoy a more flowery path: for it was energy, not\r\nausterity, at which I aimed. I would not have you imagine by this that I\r\nam bespeaking your indulgence: on the contrary, to make your correcting\r\npen more vigorous, I will confess that neither my friends nor myself are\r\naverse from the publication of this piece, if only you should join in\r\nthe approval of what is perhaps my folly. The truth is, as I must\r\npublish something, I wish it might be this performance rather than any\r\nother, because it is already finished: (you hear the wish of laziness.)\r\nAt all events, however, something I must publish, and for many reasons;\r\nchiefly because of the tracts which I have already sent in to the world,\r\nthough they have long since lost all their recommendation from novelty,\r\nare still, I am told, in request; if, after all, the booksellers are not\r\ntickling my ears. And let them; since, by that innocent deceit, I am\r\nencouraged to pursue my studies. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII -- To VOCONIUS ROMANUS\r\n\r\nDID YOU ever meet with a more abject and mean-spirited creature than\r\nMarcus Regulus since the death of Domitian, during whose reign his\r\nconduct was no less infamous, though more concealed, than under Nero's?\r\nHe began to be afraid I was angry with him, and his apprehensions were\r\nperfectly correct; I was angry. He had not only done his best to\r\nincrease the peril of the position in which Rusticus Arulenus[1] stood,\r\nbut had exulted in his death; insomuch that he actually recited and\r\npublished a libel upon his memory, in which he styles him \"The Stoics'\r\nApe\": adding, \"stigmated[2] with the Vitellian scar.\"[3] You recognize\r\nRegulus' eloquent strain! He fell with such fury upon the\r\ncharacter of Herennius Senecio that Metius Carus said to him, one day,\r\n\"What business have you with my dead? Did I ever interfere in the affair\r\nof Crassus[4] or Camerinus?\"[5] Victims, you know, to Regulus, in Nero's\r\ntime. For these reasons he imagined I was highly exasperated, and so at\r\nthe recitation of his last piece, I got no invitation. Besides, he had\r\nnot forgotten, it seems, with what deadly purpose he had once attacked\r\nme in the Court of the Hundred.[6] Rusticus had desired me to act as\r\ncounsel for Arionilla, Titnon's wife: Regulus was engaged against me. In\r\none part of the case I was strongly insisting upon a particular judgment\r\ngiven by Metius Modestus, an excellent man, at that time in banishment\r\nby Domitian's order. Now then for Regulus. \"Pray,\" says he, \"what is\r\nyour opinion of Modestus?\" You see what a risk I should have run had I\r\nanswered that I had a high opinion of him, how I should have disgraced\r\nmyself on the other hand if I had replied that I had a bad opinion of\r\nhim. But some guardian power, I am persuaded, must have stood by me to\r\nassist me in this emergency. \"I will tell you my opinion,\" I said, \"if\r\nthat is a matter to be brought before the court.\" \"I ask you,\" he\r\nrepeated, \"what is your opinion of Modestus?\" I replied that it was\r\ncustomary to examine witnesses to the character of an accused man, not\r\nto the character of one on whom sentence had already been passed. He\r\npressed me a third time. \"I do not now enquire,\" said he, \"your opinion\r\nof Modestus in general, I only ask your opinion of his loyalty.\" \"Since\r\nyou will have my opinion then,\" I rejoined, \"I think it illegal even to\r\nask a question concerning a person who stands convicted.\" He sat down at\r\nthis, completely silenced; and I received applause and congratulation on\r\nall sides, that without injuring my reputation by an advantageous,\r\nperhaps, though ungenerous answer, I had not entangled myself in the\r\ntoils of so insidious a catch-question. Thoroughly frightened upon this\r\nthen, he first seizes upon Caecilius Celer, next he goes and begs of\r\nFabius Justus, that they would use their joint interest to bring about a\r\nreconciliation between us. And lest this should not be sufficient, he\r\nsets off to Spurinna as well; to whom he came in the humblest way (for\r\nhe is the most abject creature alive, where he has anything to be afraid\r\nof) and says to him, \"Do, I entreat of you, call on Pliny to-morrow\r\nmorning, certainly in the morning, no later (for I cannot endure this\r\nanxiety of mind longer), and endeavour by any means in your power to\r\nsoften his resentment.\" I was already up, the next day, when a message\r\narrived from Spurinna, \"I am coming to call on you.\" I sent word back,\r\n\"Nay, I will wait upon you;\" however, both of us setting out to pay this\r\nvisit, we met under Livia's portico. He acquainted me with the\r\ncommission he had received from Regulus, and interceded for him as\r\nbecame so worthy a man in behalf of one so totally dissimilar, without\r\ngreatly pressing the thing. \"I will leave it to you,\" was my reply, \"to\r\nconsider what answer to return Regulus; you ought not to be deceived by\r\nme. I am waiting for Mauricus'[7] return\" (for he had not yet come back\r\nout of exile), \"so that I cannot give you any definite answer either\r\nway, as I mean to be guided entirely by his decision, for he ought to be\r\nmy leader here, and I simply to do as he says.\" Well, a few days after\r\nthis, Regulus met me as I was at the praetor's; he kept close to me\r\nthere and begged a word in private, when he said he was afraid I deeply\r\nresented an expression he had once made use of in his reply to Satrius\r\nand myself, before the Court of the Hundred, to this effect, \"Satrius\r\nRufus, who does not endeavour to rival Cicero, and who is content with\r\nthe eloquence of our own day.\" I answered, now I perceived indeed, upon\r\nhis own confession, that he had meant it ill-naturedly; otherwise it\r\nmight have passed for a compliment. \"For I am free to own,\" I said,\r\n\"that I do endeavour to rival Cicero, and am not content with the\r\neloquence of our own day. For I consider it the very height of folly not\r\nto copy the best models of every kind. But, how happens it that you, who\r\nhave so good a recollection of what passed upon this occasion, should\r\nhave forgotten that other, when you asked me my opinion of the loyalty\r\nof Modestus?\" Pale as he always is, he turned simply pallid at this, and\r\nstammered out, \"I did not intend to hurt you when I asked this question,\r\nbut Modestus.\" Observe the vindictive cruelty of the fellow, who made no\r\nconcealment of his willingness to injure a banished man. But the reason\r\nhe alleged in justification of his conduct is pleasant. Modestus, he\r\nexplained, in a letter of his, which was read to Domitian, had used the\r\nfollowing expression, \"Regulus, the biggest rascal that walks upon two\r\nfeet:\" and what Modestus had written was the simple truth, beyond all\r\nmanner of controversy. Here, about, our conversation came to an end, for\r\nI did not wish to proceed further, being desirous to keep matters open\r\nuntil Mauricus returns. It is no easy matter, I am well aware of that,\r\nto destroy Regulus; he is rich, and at the head of a party; courted[8]\r\nby many, feared by more: a passion that will sometimes prevail even\r\nbeyond friendship itself. But, after all, ties of this sort are not so\r\nstrong but they may be loosened; for a bad man's credit is as shifty as\r\nhimself. However (to repeat), I am waiting until Mauricus comes back. He\r\nis a man of sound judgment and great sagacity formed upon long\r\nexperience, and who, from his observations of the past, well knows how\r\nto judge of the future. I shall talk the matter over with him, and\r\nconsider myself justified either in pursuing or dropping this affair, as\r\nhe shall advise. Meanwhile I thought I owed this account to our mutual\r\nfriendship, which gives you an undoubted right to know about not only\r\nall my actions but all my plans as well. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV -- To CORNELIUS TACITUS\r\n\r\nYou will laugh (and you are quite welcome) when I tell you that your old\r\nacquaintance is turned sportsman, and has taken three noble boars.\r\n\"What!\" you exclaim, \"Pliny!\"--Even he. However, I indulged at the same\r\ntime my beloved inactivity; and, whilst I sat at my nets, you would have\r\nfound me, not with boar spear or javelin, but pencil and tablet, by my\r\nside. I mused and wrote, being determined to return, if with all my\r\nhands empty, at least with my memorandums full. Believe me, this way of\r\nstudying is not to be despised: it is wonderful how the mind is stirred\r\nand quickened into activity by brisk bodily exercise. There is\r\nsomething, too, in the solemnity of the venerable woods with which one\r\nis surrounded, together with that profound silence which is observed on\r\nthese occasions, that forcibly disposes the mind to meditation. So for\r\nthe future, let me advise you, whenever you hunt, to take your tablets\r\nalong with you, as well as your basket and bottle, for be assured you\r\nwill find Minerva no less fond of traversing the hills than Diana.\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV -- To POMPEIUS SATURNINUS\r\n\r\nNOTHING could be more seasonable than the letter which I received from\r\nyou, in which you so earnestly beg me to send you some of my literary\r\nefforts: the very thing I was intending to do. So you have only put\r\nspurs into a willing horse and at once saved yourself the excuse of\r\nrefusing the trouble, and me the awkwardness of asking the favour.\r\nWithout hesitation then I avail myself of your offer; as you must now\r\ntake the consequence of it without reluctance. But you are not to expect\r\nanything new from a lazy fellow, for I am going to ask you to revise\r\nagain the speech I made to my fellow-townsmen when I dedicated the\r\npublic library to their use. You have already, I remember, obliged me\r\nwith some annotations upon this piece, but only in a general way; and so\r\nI now beg of you not only to take a general view of the whole speech,\r\nbut, as you usually do, to go over it in detail. When you have corrected\r\nit, I shall still be at liberty to publish or suppress it: and the delay\r\nin the meantime will be attended with one of these alternatives; for,\r\nwhile we are deliberating whether it is fit for publishing, a frequent\r\nrevision will either make it so, or convince me that it is not. Though\r\nindeed my principal difficulty respecting the publication of this\r\nharangue arises not so much from the composition as out of the subject\r\nitself, which has something in it, I am afraid, that will look too like\r\nostentation and self-conceit. For, be the style ever so plain and\r\nunassuming, yet, as the occasion necessarily led me to speak not only of\r\nthe munificence of my ancestors, but of my own as well, my modesty will\r\nbe seriously embarrassed. A dangerous and slippery situation this, even\r\nwhen one is led into it by plea of necessity! For, if mankind are not\r\nvery favourable to panegyric, even when bestowed upon others, how much\r\nmore difficult is it to reconcile them to it when it is a tribute which\r\nwe pay to ourselves or to our ancestors? Virtue, by herself, is\r\ngenerally the object of envy, but particularly so when glory and\r\ndistinction attend her; and the world is never so little disposed to\r\ndetract from the rectitude of your conduct as when it passes unobserved\r\nand unapplauded. For these reasons, I frequently ask myself whether I\r\ncomposed this harangue, such as it is, merely from a personal\r\nconsideration, or with a view to the public as well; and I am sensible\r\nthat what may be exceedingly useful and proper in the prosecution of any\r\naffair may lose all its grace and fitness the moment the business is\r\ncompleted: for instance, in the case before us, what could be more to my\r\npurpose than to explain at large the motives of my intended bounty? For,\r\nfirst, it engaged my mind in good and ennobling thoughts; next, it\r\nenabled me, by frequent dwelling upon them, to receive a perfect\r\nimpression of their loveliness, while it guarded at the same time\r\nagainst that repentance which is sure to follow on an impulsive act of\r\ngenerosity. There arose also a further advantage from this method, as it\r\nfixed in me a certain habitual contempt of money. For, while mankind\r\nseem to be universally governed by an innate passion to accumulate\r\nwealth, the cultivation of a more generous affection in my own breast\r\ntaught me to emancipate myself from the slavery of so predominant a\r\nprinciple: and I thought that my honest intentions would be the more\r\nmeritorious as they should appear to proceed, not from sudden impulse,\r\nbut from the dictates of cool and deliberate reflection. I considered,\r\nbesides, that I was not engaging myself to exhibit public games or\r\ngladiatorial combats, but to establish an annual fund for the support\r\nand education of young men of good families but scanty means. The\r\npleasures of the senses are so far from wanting the oratorical arts to\r\nrecommend them that we stand in need of all the powers of eloquence to\r\nmoderate and restrain rather than stir up their influence. But the work\r\nof getting anybody to cheerfully undertake the monotony and drudgery of\r\neducation must be effected not by pay merely, but by a skilfully worked-\r\nup appeal to the emotions as well. If physicians find it expedient to\r\nuse the most insinuating address in recommending to their patients a\r\nwholesome though, perhaps, unpleasant regimen, how much more occasion\r\nhad he to exert all the powers of persuasion who, out of regard to the\r\npublic welfare, was endeavouring to reconcile it to a most useful though\r\nnot equally popular benefaction? Particularly, as my aim was to\r\nrecommend an institution, calculated solely for the benefit of those who\r\nwere parents to men who, at present, had no children; and to persuade\r\nthe greater number to wait patiently until they should be entitled to an\r\nhonour of which a few only could immediately partake. But as at that\r\ntime, when I attempted to explain and enforce the general design and\r\nbenefit of my institution, I considered more the general good of my\r\ncountrymen, than any reputation which might result to myself; so I am\r\napprehensive lest, if I publish that piece, it may perhaps look as if I\r\nhad a view rather to my own personal credit than the benefit of others.\r\nBesides, I am very sensible how much nobler it is to place the reward of\r\nvirtue in the silent approbation of one's own breast than in the\r\napplause of the world. Glory ought to be the consequence, not the\r\nmotive, of our actions; and although it happen not to attend the worthy\r\ndeed, yet it is by no means the less fair for having missed the applause\r\nit deserved. But the world is apt to suspect that those who celebrate\r\ntheir own beneficent acts performed them for no other motive than to\r\nhave the pleasure of extolling them. Thus, the splendour of an action\r\nwhich would have been deemed illustrious if related by another is\r\ntotally extinguished when it becomes the subject of one's own applause.\r\nSuch is the disposition of mankind, if they cannot blast the action,\r\nthey will censure its display; and whether you do what does not deserve\r\nparticular notice, or set forth yourself what does, either way you incur\r\nreproach. In my own case there is a peculiar circumstance that weighs\r\nmuch with me: this speech was delivered not before the people, but the\r\nDecurii;[9] not in the forum, but the senate; I am afraid therefore it\r\nwill look inconsistent that I, who, when I delivered it, seemed to avoid\r\npopular applause, should now, by publishing this performance, appear to\r\ncourt it: that I, who was so scrupulous as not to admit even these\r\npersons to be present when I delivered this speech, who were interested\r\nin my benefaction, lest it might be suspected I was actuated in this\r\naffair by any ambitious views, should now seem to solicit admiration, by\r\nforwardly displaying it to such as have no other concern in my\r\nmunificence than the benefit of example. These are the scruples which\r\nhave occasioned my delay in giving this piece to the public; but I\r\nsubmit them entirely to your judgment, which I shall ever esteem as a\r\nsufficient sanction of my conduct. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI -- To ATRIUS CLEMENS\r\n\r\nIF ever polite literature flourished at Rome, it certainly flourishes\r\nnow; and I could give you many eminent instances: I will content myself,\r\nhowever, with naming only Euphrates[10] the philosopher. I first became\r\nacquainted with this excellent person in my youth, when I served in the\r\narmy in Syria. I had an opportunity of conversing with him familiarly,\r\nand took some pains to gain his affection: though that, indeed, was not\r\nvery difficult, for he is easy of access, unreserved, and actuated by\r\nthose social principles he professes to teach. I should think myself\r\nextremely happy if I had as fully answered the expectations he, at that\r\ntime, conceived of me, as he exceeds everything I had imagined of him.\r\nBut, perhaps, I admire his excellencies more now than I did then,\r\nbecause I know better how to appreciate them; not that I sufficiently\r\nappreciate them even now. For as none but those who are skilled in\r\npainting, statuary, or the plastic art, can form a right judgment of any\r\nperformance in those respective modes of representation, so a man must,\r\nhimself, have made great advances in philosophy before he is capable of\r\nforming a just opinion of a philosopher. However, as far as I am\r\nqualified to determine, Euphrates is possessed of so many shining\r\ntalents that he cannot fail to attract and impress the most ordinarily\r\neducated observer. He reasons with much force, acuteness, and elegance;\r\nand frequently rises into all the sublime and luxuriant eloquence of\r\nPlato. His style is varied and flowing, and at the same time so\r\nwonderfully captivating that he forces the reluctant attention of the\r\nmost unwilling hearer. For the rest, a fine stature, a comely aspect,\r\nlong hair, and a large silver beard; circumstances which, though they\r\nmay probably be thought trifling and accidental, contribute, however, to\r\ngain him much reverence. There is no affected negligence in his dress\r\nand appearance; his countenance is grave but not austere; and his\r\napproach commands respect without creating awe. Distinguished as he is\r\nby the perfect blamelessness of his life, he is no less so by the\r\ncourtesy and engaging sweetness of his manner. He attacks vices, not\r\npersons, and, without severity, reclaims the wanderer from the paths of\r\nvirtue. You follow his exhortations with rapt attention, hanging, as it\r\nwere, upon his lips; and even after the heart is convinced, the ear\r\nstill wishes to listen to the harmonious reasoner. His family consists\r\nof three children (two of which are sons), whom he educates with the\r\nutmost care. His father-in-law, Pompeius Julianus, as he greatly\r\ndistinguished himself in every other part of his life, so particularly\r\nin this, that though he was himself of the highest rank in his province,\r\nyet, among many considerable matches, he preferred Euphrates for his\r\nson-in-law, as first in merit, though not in dignity. But why do I dwell\r\nany longer upon the virtues of a man whose conversation I am so\r\nunfortunate as not to have time sufficiently to enjoy? Is it to increase\r\nmy regret and vexation that I cannot enjoy it? My time is wholly taken\r\nup in the execution of a very honourable, indeed, but equally\r\ntroublesome, employment; in hearing cases, signing petitions, making up\r\naccounts, and writing a vast amount of the most illiterate literature. I\r\nsometimes complain to Euphrates (for I have leisure at least to\r\ncomplain) of these unpleasing occupations. He endeavours to console me,\r\nby affirming that, to be engaged in the public service, to hear and\r\ndetermine cases, to explain the laws, and administer justice, is a part,\r\nand the noblest part, too, of philosophy; as it is reducing to practice\r\nwhat her professors teach in speculation. But even his rhetoric will\r\nnever be able to convince me that it is better to be at this sort of\r\nwork than to spend whole days in attending his lectures and learning his\r\nprecepts. I cannot therefore but strongly recommend it to you, who have\r\nthe time for it, when next you come to town (and you will come, I\r\ndaresay, so much the sooner for this), to take the benefit of his\r\nelegant and refined instructions. For I do not (as many do) envy others\r\nthe happiness I cannot share with them myself: on the contrary, it is a\r\nvery sensible pleasure to me when I find my friends in possession of an\r\nenjoyment from which I have the misfortune to be excluded. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII -- To FABIUS JUSTUS\r\n\r\nIT is a long time since I have had a letter from you, \"There is nothing\r\nto write about,\" you say: well then write and let me know just this,\r\nthat \"there is nothing to write about,\" or tell me in the good old\r\nstyle, _If you are well that's right, I am quite well_. This will do for\r\nme, for it implies everything. You think I am joking? Let me assure you\r\nI am in sober earnest. Do let me know how you are; for I cannot remain\r\nignorant any longer without growing exceedingly anxious about you.\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII -- To CALESTRIUS TIRO\r\n\r\nI HAVE suffered the heaviest loss; if that word be sufficiently strong\r\nto express the misfortune which has deprived me of so excellent a man.\r\nCorellius Rufus is dead; and dead, too, by his own act! A circumstance\r\nof great aggravation to my affliction: as that sort of death which we\r\ncannot impute either to the course of nature, or the hand of Providence,\r\nis, of all others, the most to be lamented. It affords some consolation\r\nin the loss of those friends whom disease snatches from us that they\r\nfall by the general destiny of mankind; but those who destroy themselves\r\nleave us under the inconsolable reflection, that they had it in their\r\npower to have lived longer. It is true, Corellius had many inducements\r\nto be fond of life; a blameless conscience, high reputation, and great\r\ndignity of character, besides a daughter, a wife, a grandson, and\r\nsisters; and, amidst these numerous pledges of happiness, faithful\r\nfriends. Still, it must be owned he had the highest motive (which to a\r\nwise man will always have the force of destiny), urging him to this\r\nresolution. He had long been tortured by so tedious and painful a\r\ncomplaint that even these inducements to living on, considerable as they\r\nare, were over-balanced by the reasons on the other side. In his thirty-\r\nthird year (as I have frequently heard him say) he was seized with the\r\ngout in his feet. This was hereditary; for diseases, as well as\r\npossessions, are sometimes handed down by a sort of inheritance. A life\r\nof sobriety and continence had enabled him to conquer and keep down the\r\ndisease while he was still young, latterly as it grew upon him with\r\nadvancing years, he had to manfully bear it, suffering meanwhile the\r\nmost incredible and undeserved agonies; for the gout was now not only in\r\nhis feet, but had spread itself over his whole body. I remember, in\r\nDomitian's reign, paying him a visit at his villa, near Rome. As soon as\r\nI entered his chamber, his servants went out: for it was his rule, never\r\nto allow them to be in the room when any intimate friend was with him;\r\nnay, even his own wife, though she could have kept any secret, used to\r\ngo too. Casting his eyes round the room, \"Why,\" he exclaimed, \"do you\r\nsuppose I endure life so long under these cruel agonies? It is with the\r\nhope that I may outlive, at least for one day, that villain.\" Had his\r\nbodily strength been equal to his resolution, he would have carried his\r\ndesire into practical effect. God heard and answered his prayer; and\r\nwhen he felt that he should now die a free, un-enslaved, Roman, he broke\r\nthrough those other great, but now less forcible, attachments to the\r\nworld. His malady increased; and, as it now grew too violent to admit of\r\nany relief from temperance, he resolutely determined to put an end to\r\nits uninterrupted attacks, by an effort of heroism. He had refused all\r\nsustenance during four days when his wife Hispulla sent our common\r\nfriend Geminius to me, with the melancholy news, that Corellius was\r\nresolved to die; and that neither her own entreaties nor her daughter's\r\ncould move him from his purpose; I was the only person left who could\r\nreconcile him to life. I ran to his house with the utmost precipitation.\r\nAs I approached it, I met a second messenger from Hispulla, Julius\r\nAtticus, who informed me there was nothing to be hoped for now, even\r\nfrom me, as he seemed more hardened than ever in his purpose. He had\r\nsaid, indeed to his physician, who pressed him to take some nourishment,\r\n\"'Tis resolved\": an expression which, as it raised my admiration of the\r\ngreatness of his soul, so it does my grief for the loss of him. I keep\r\nthinking what a friend, what a man, I am deprived of. That he had\r\nreached his sixty-seventh year, an age which even the strongest seldom\r\nexceed, I well know; that he is released from a life of continual pain;\r\nthat he has left his dearest friends behind him, and (what was dearer to\r\nhim than all these) the state in a prosperous condition: all this I\r\nknow. Still I cannot forbear to lament him, as if he had been in the\r\nprime and vigour of his days; and I lament him (shall I own my\r\nweakness?) on my account. And--to confess to you as I did to Calvisius,\r\nin the first transport of my grief--I sadly fear, now that I am no\r\nlonger under his eye, I shall not keep so strict a guard over my\r\nconduct. Speak comfort to me then, not that he was old, he was infirm;\r\nall this I know: but by supplying me with some reflections that are new\r\nand resistless, which I have never heard, never read, anywhere else. For\r\nall that I have heard, and all that I have read, occur to me of\r\nthemselves; but all these are by far too weak to support me under so\r\nsevere an affliction. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX -- To SOCIUS SENECIO\r\n\r\nThis year has produced a plentiful crop of poets: during the whole month\r\nof April scarcely a day has passed on which we have not been entertained\r\nwith the recital of some poem. It is a pleasure to me to find that a\r\ntaste for polite literature still exists, and that men of genius do come\r\nforward and make themselves known, notwithstanding the lazy attendance\r\nthey got for their pains. The greater part of the audience sit in the\r\nlounging-places, gossip away their time there, and are perpetually\r\nsending to enquire whether the author has made his entrance yet, whether\r\nhe has got through the preface, or whether he has almost finished the\r\npiece. Then at length they saunter in with an air of the greatest\r\nindifference, nor do they condescend to stay through the recital, but go\r\nout before it is over, some slyly and stealthily, others again with\r\nperfect freedom and unconcern. And yet our fathers can remember how\r\nClaudius Cæsar walking one day in the palace, and hearing a great\r\nshouting, enquired the cause: and being informed that Nonianus[11] was\r\nreciting a composition of his, went immediately to the place, and\r\nagreeably surprised the author with his presence. But now, were one to\r\nbespeak the attendance of the idlest man living, and remind him of the\r\nappointment ever so often, or ever so long beforehand; either he would\r\nnot come at all, or if he did would grumble about having \"lost a day!\"\r\nfor no other reason but because he had not lost it. So much the more do\r\nthose authors deserve our encouragement and applause who have resolution\r\nto persevere in their studies, and to read out their compositions in\r\nspite of this apathy or arrogance on the part of their audience. Myself\r\nindeed, I scarcely ever miss being present upon any occasion; though, to\r\ntell the truth, the authors have generally been friends of mine, as\r\nindeed there are few men of literary tastes who are not. It is this\r\nwhich has kept me in town longer than I had intended. I am now, however,\r\nat liberty to go back into the country, and write something myself;\r\nwhich I do not intend reciting, lest I should seem rather to have lent\r\nthan given my attendance to these recitations of my friends, for in\r\nthese, as in all other good offices, the obligation ceases the moment\r\nyou seem to expect a return. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX -- To JUNSUS MAURICUS\r\n\r\nYou desire me to look out a proper husband for your niece: it is with\r\njustice you enjoin me that office. You know the high esteem and\r\naffection I bore that great man her father, and with what noble\r\ninstructions he nurtured my youth, and taught me to deserve those\r\npraises he was pleased to bestow upon me. You could not give me, then, a\r\nmore important, or more agreeable, commission; nor could I be employed\r\nin an office of higher honour, than that of choosing a young man worthy\r\nof being father of the grandchildren of Rusticus Arulenus; a choice I\r\nshould be long in determining, were I not acquainted with Minutius\r\nAemilianus, who seems formed for our purpose. He loves me with all that\r\nwarmth of affection which is usual between young men of equal years (as\r\nindeed I have the advance of him but by a very few), and reveres me at\r\nthe same time, with all the deference due to age; and, in a word, he is\r\nno less desirous to model himself by my instructions than I was by those\r\nof yourself and your brother.\r\n\r\nHe is a native of Brixia, one of those provinces in Italy which still\r\nretain much of the old modesty, frugal simplicity, and even rusticity,\r\nof manner. He is the son of Minutius Macrinus, whose humble desires were\r\nsatisfied with standing at the head of the equestrian order: for though\r\nhe was nominated by Vespasian in the number of those whom that prince\r\ndignified with the praetorian office, yet, with an inflexible greatness\r\nof mind, he resolutely preferred an honourable repose, to the ambitious,\r\nshall I call them, or exalted, pursuits, in which we public men are\r\nengaged. His grandmother, on the mother's side, is Serrana Procula, of\r\nPatavium:[12] you are no stranger to the character of its citizens; yet\r\nSerrana is looked upon, even among these correct people, as an exemplary\r\ninstance of strict virtue. Acilius, his uncle, is a man of almost\r\nexceptional gravity, wisdom, and integrity. In short, you will find\r\nnothing throughout his family unworthy of yours. Minutius himself has\r\nplenty of vivacity, as well as application, together with a most amiable\r\nand becoming modesty. He has already, with considerable credit, passed\r\nthrough the offices of quaestor, tribune, and praetor; so that you will\r\nbe spared the trouble of soliciting for him those honourable\r\nemployments. He has a fine, well-bred, countenance, with a ruddy,\r\nhealthy complexion, while his whole person is elegant and comely and his\r\nmien graceful and senatorian: advantages, I think, by no means to be\r\nslighted, and which I consider as the proper tribute to virgin\r\ninnocence. I think I may add that his father is very rich. When I\r\ncontemplate the character of those who require a husband of my choosing,\r\nI know it is unnecessary to mention wealth; but when I reflect upon the\r\nprevailing manners of the age, and even the laws of Rome, which rank a\r\nman according to his possessions, it certainly claims some regard; and,\r\nindeed, in establishments of this nature, where children and many other\r\ncircumstances are to be duly weighed, it is an article that well\r\ndeserves to be taken into the account. You will be inclined, perhaps, to\r\nsuspect that affection has had too great a share in the character I have\r\nbeen drawing, and that I have heightened it beyond the truth: but I will\r\nstake all my credit, you will find everything far beyond what I have\r\nrepresented. I love the young fellow indeed (as he justly deserves) with\r\nall the warmth of a most ardent affection; but for that very reason I\r\nwould not ascribe more to his merit than I know it will bear. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI -- To SEPTITIUS CLARUS\r\n\r\nAh! you are a pretty fellow! You make an engagement to come to supper\r\nand then never appear. Justice shall be exacted;--you shall reimburse me\r\nto the very last penny the expense I went to on your account; no small\r\nsum, let me tell you. I had prepared, you must know, a lettuce a-piece,\r\nthree snails, two eggs, and a barley cake, with some sweet wine and\r\nsnow, (the snow most certainly I shall charge to your account, as a\r\nrarity that will not keep.) Olives, beet-root, gourds, onions, and a\r\nthousand other dainties equally sumptuous. You should likewise have been\r\nentertained either with an interlude, the rehearsal of a poem, or a\r\npiece of music, whichever you preferred; or (such was my liberality)\r\nwith all three. But the oysters, sows'-bellies, sea-urchins, and dancers\r\nfrom Cadiz of a certain--I know not who, were, it seems, more to your\r\ntaste. You shall give satisfaction, how, shall at present be a secret.\r\n\r\nOh! you have behaved cruelly, grudging your friend,--had almost said\r\nyourself;--and upon second thoughts I do say so;--in this way: for how\r\nagreeably should we have spent the evening, in laughing, trifling, and\r\nliterary amusements! You may sup, I confess, at many places more\r\nsplendidly; but nowhere with more unconstrained mirth, simplicity, and\r\nfreedom: only make the experiment, and if you do not ever after excuse\r\nyourself to your other friends, to come to me, always put me off to go\r\nto them. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII -- To SUETONIUS TRANQUILLUS\r\n\r\nYou tell me in your letter that you are extremely alarmed by a dream;\r\napprehending that it forebodes some ill success to you in the case you\r\nhave undertaken to defend; and, therefore, desire that I would get it\r\nadjourned for a few days, or, at least, to the next. This will be no\r\neasy matter, but I will try:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For dreams descend from Jove.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it is very material for you to recollect whether your dreams\r\ngenerally represent things as they afterwards fall out, or quite the\r\nreverse. But if I may judge of yours by one that happened to myself,\r\nthis dream that alarms you seems to portend that you will acquit\r\nyourself with great success. I had promised to stand counsel for Junius\r\nPastor; when I fancied in my sleep that my mother-in-law came to me,\r\nand, throwing herself at my feet, earnestly entreated me not to plead. I\r\nwas at that time a very young man; the case was to be argued in the four\r\ncentumviral courts; my adversaries were some of the most important\r\npersonages in Rome, and particular favourites of Cæsar;[13] any of which\r\ncircumstances were sufficient, after such an inauspicious dream, to have\r\ndiscouraged me. Notwithstanding this, I engaged in the cause, reflecting\r\nthat,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Without a sign, his sword the brave man draws, And asks no omen but his\r\ncountry's cause.\"<a href=\"#linknote-14\" name=\"linknoteref-14\"\r\nid=\"linknoteref-14\">[14]</a>\r\n\r\nfor I looked upon the promise I had given to be as sacred to me as my\r\ncountry, or, if that were possible, more so. The event happened as I\r\nwished; and it was that very case which first procured me the favourable\r\nattention of the public, and threw open to me the gates of Fame.\r\nConsider then whether your dream, like this one I have related, may not\r\npre-signify success. But, after all, perhaps you will think it safer to\r\npursue this cautious maxim: \"Never do a thing concerning the rectitude\r\nof which you are in doubt;\" if so, write me word. In the interval, I\r\nwill consider of some excuse, and will so plead your cause that you may\r\nbe able to plead it your self any day you like best. In this respect,\r\nyou are in a better situation than I was: the court of the centumviri,\r\nwhere I was to plead, admits of no adjournment: whereas, in that where\r\nyour case is to be heard, though no easy matter to procure one, still,\r\nhowever, it is possible. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII -- To ROMANUS FIRMUS\r\n\r\nAs you are my towns-man, my school-fellow, and the earliest companion of\r\nmy youth; as there was the strictest friendship between my mother and\r\nuncle and your father (a happiness which I also enjoyed as far as the\r\ngreat inequality of our ages would admit); can I fail (thus biassed as I\r\nam by so many and weighty considerations) to contribute all in my power\r\nto the advancement of your honours? The rank you bear in our province,\r\nas decurio, is a proof that you are possessed, at least, of an hundred\r\nthousand sesterces;[15] but that we may also have the satisfaction of\r\nseeing you a Roman Knight,[16] I present you with three hundred\r\nthousand, in order to make up the sum requisite to entitle you to that\r\ndignity. The long acquaintance we have had leaves me no room to\r\napprehend you will ever be forgetful of this instance of my friendship.\r\nAnd I know your disposition too well to think it necessary to advise you\r\nto enjoy this honour with the modesty that becomes a person who receives\r\nit from me; for the advanced rank we possess through a friend's kindness\r\nis a sort of sacred trust, in which we have his judgment, as well as our\r\nown character, to maintain, and therefore to be guarded with the greater\r\ncaution. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV -- TO CORNELIUS TACITUS\r\n\r\nI HAVE frequent debates with a certain acquaintance of mine, a man of\r\nskill and learning, who admires nothing so much in the eloquence of the\r\nbar as conciseness. I agree with him, that where the case will admit of\r\nthis precision, it may with propriety be adopted; but insist that, to\r\nleave out what is material to be mentioned,--or only briefly and\r\ncursorily to touch upon those points which should be inculcated,\r\nimpressed, and urged well home upon the minds of the audience, is a\r\ndownright fraud upon one's client. In many cases, to deal with the\r\nsubject at greater length adds strength and weight to our ideas, which\r\nfrequently produce their impression upon the mind, as iron does upon\r\nsolid bodies, rather by repeated strokes than a single blow. In answer\r\nto this, he usually has recourse to authorities, and produces Lysias[17]\r\namongst the Grecians, together with Cato and the two Gracchi, among our\r\nown countrymen, many of whose speeches certainly are brief and\r\ncurtailed. In return, I name Demosthenes, Aeschines, Hyperides,[18] and\r\nmany others, in opposition to Lysias; while I confront Cato and the\r\nGracchi with Cæsar, Pollio,[19] Caelius,[20] but, above all, Cicero,\r\nwhose longest speech is generally considered his best. Why, no doubt\r\nabout it, in good compositions, as in everything else that is valuable,\r\nthe more there is of them, the better. You may observe in statues,\r\nbasso-relievos, pictures, and the human form, and even in animals and\r\ntrees, that nothing is more graceful than magnitude, if accompanied with\r\nproportion. The same holds true in pleading; and even in books a large\r\nvolume carries a certain beauty and authority in its very size. My\r\nantagonist, who is extremely dexterous at evading an argument, eludes\r\nall this, and much more, which I usually urge to the same purpose, by\r\ninsisting that those very individuals, upon whose works I found my\r\nopinion, made considerable additions to their speeches when they\r\npublished them. This I deny; and appeal to the harangues of numberless\r\norators, particularly to those of Cicero, for Murena and Varenus, in\r\nwhich a short, bare notification of certain charges is expressed under\r\nmere heads. Whence it appears that many things which he enlarged upon at\r\nthe time he delivered those speeches were retrenched when he gave them\r\nto the public. The same excellent orator informs us that, agreeably to\r\nthe ancient custom, which allowed only of one counsel on a side,\r\nCluentius had no other advocate than himself; and he tells us further\r\nthat he employed four whole days in defence of Cornelius; by which it\r\nplainly appears that those speeches which, when delivered at their full\r\nlength, had necessarily taken up so much time at the bar were\r\nconsiderably cut down and pruned when he afterwards compressed them into\r\na single volume, though, I must confess, indeed, a large one. But good\r\npleading, it is objected, is one thing, just composition another. This\r\nobjection, I am aware, has had some favourers; nevertheless, I am\r\npersuaded (though I may, perhaps, be mistaken) that, as it is possible\r\nyou may have a good pleading which is not a good speech, so a good\r\nspeech cannot be a bad pleading; for the speech on paper is the model\r\nand, as it were, the archetype of the speech that was delivered. It is\r\nfor this reason we find, in many of the best speeches extant, numberless\r\nextemporaneous turns of expression; and even in those which we are sure\r\nwere never spoken; as, for instance, in the following passage from the\r\nspeech against Verres: --\"A certain mechanic--what's his name? Oh, thank\r\nyou for helping me to it: yes, I mean Polyclitus.\" It follows, then,\r\nthat the nearer approach a speaker makes to the rules of just\r\ncomposition, the more perfect will he be in his art; always supposing,\r\nhowever, that he has his due share of time allowed him; for, if he be\r\nlimited of that article, no blame can justly be fixed upon the advocate,\r\nthough much certainly upon the judge. The sense of the laws, I am sure,\r\nis on my side, which are by no means sparing of the orator's time; it is\r\nnot conciseness, but fulness, a complete representation of every\r\nmaterial circumstance, which they recommend. Now conciseness cannot\r\neffect this, unless in the most insignificant cases. Let me add what\r\nexperience, that unerring guide, has taught me: it has frequently been\r\nmy province to act both as an advocate and a judge; and I have often\r\nalso attended as an assessor.[21] Upon those occasions, I have ever\r\nfound the judgments of mankind are to be influenced by different modes\r\nof application, and that the slightest circumstances frequently produce\r\nthe most important consequences. The dispositions and understandings of\r\nmen vary to such an extent that they seldom agree in their opinions\r\nconcerning any one point in debate before them; or, if they do, it is\r\ngenerally from different motives. Besides, as every man is naturally\r\npartial to his own discoveries, when he hears an argument urged which\r\nhad previously occurred to himself, he will be sure to embrace it as\r\nextremely convincing. The orator, therefore, should so adapt himself to\r\nhis audience as to throw out something which every one of them, in turn,\r\nmay receive and approve as agreeable to his own particular views. I\r\nrecollect, once when Regulus and I were engaged on the same side, his\r\nremarking to me, \"You seem to think it necessary to go into every single\r\ncircumstance: whereas I always take aim at once at my adversary's\r\nthroat, and there I press him closely.\" ('Tis true, he keeps a tight\r\nhold of whatever part he has once fixed upon; but the misfortune is, he\r\nis extremely apt to fix upon the wrong place.) I replied, it might\r\npossibly happen that what he called the throat was, in reality, the knee\r\nor the ankle. As for myself, said I, who do not pretend to direct my aim\r\nwith so much precision, I test every part, I probe every opening; in\r\nshort, to use a vulgar proverb, I leave no stone unturned. And as in\r\nagriculture, it is not my vineyards or my woods only, but my fields as\r\nwell, that I look after and cultivate, and (to carry on the metaphor) as\r\nI do not content myself with sowing those fields simply with corn or\r\nwhite wheat, but sprinkle in barley, pulse, and the other kinds of\r\ngrain; so, in my pleadings at the bar, I scatter broadcast various\r\narguments like so many kinds of seed, in order to reap whatever may\r\nhappen to come up. For the disposition of your judges is as hard to\r\nfathom as uncertain, and as little to be relied on as that of soils and\r\nseasons. The comic writer Eupolis,[22] I remember, mentions it in praise\r\nof that excellent orator Pericles, that\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On his lips Persuasion hung, And powerful Reason rul'd his tongue: Thus\r\nhe alone could boast the art To charm at once, and pierce the heart.\"\r\n\r\n[23] But could Pericles, without the richest variety of expression, and\r\nmerely by the force of the concise or the rapid style, or both (for they\r\nare very different), have thus charmed and pierced the heart. To delight\r\nand to persuade requires time and great command of language; and to\r\nleave a sting in the minds of the audience is an effect not to be\r\nexpected from an orator who merely pinks, but from him, and him only,\r\nwho thrusts in. Another comic poet,[24] speaking of the same orator,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"His mighty words like Jove's own thunder roll; Greece hears, and\r\ntrembles to her inmost soul.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is not the close and reserved; it is the copious, the majestic,\r\nand the sublime orator, who thunders, who lightens, who, in short, bears\r\nall before him in a confused whirl. There is, undeniably, a just mean in\r\neverything; but he equally misses the mark who falls short of it, as he\r\nwho goes beyond it; he who is too limited as he who is too unrestrained.\r\nHence it is as common a thing to hear our orators condemned for being\r\ntoo jejune and feeble as too excessive and redundant. One is said to\r\nhave exceeded the bounds of his subject, the other not to have reached\r\nthem. Both, no doubt, are equally in fault, with this difference,\r\nhowever, that in the one the fault arises from an abundance, in the\r\nother, from a deficiency; an error, in the former case, which, if it be\r\nnot the sign of a more correct, is certainly of a more fertile genius.\r\nWhen I say this, I would not be understood to approve that everlasting\r\ntalker[25] mentioned in Homer, but that other' described in the\r\nfollowing lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Frequent and soft, as falls the winter snow, Thus from his lips the\r\ncopious periods flow.\"\r\n\r\nNot but that I extremely admire him,[26] too, of whom the poet says,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Few were his words, but wonderfully strong.\"\r\n\r\nYet, if the choice were given me, I should give the preference to that\r\nstyle resembling winter snow, that is, to the full, uninterrupted, and\r\ndiffusive; in short, to that pomp of eloquence which seems all heavenly\r\nand divine. But (it is replied) the harangue of a more moderate length\r\nis most generally admired. It is:--but only by indolent people; and to\r\nfix the standard by their laziness and false delicacy would be simply\r\nridiculous. Were you to consult persons of this cast, they would tell\r\nyou, not only that it is best to say little, but that it is best to say\r\nnothing at all. Thus, my friend, I have laid before you my opinions upon\r\nthis subject, and I am willing to change them if not agreeable to yours.\r\nBut should you disagree with me, pray let me know clearly your reasons\r\nwhy. For, though I ought to yield in this case to your more enlightened\r\njudgment, yet, in a point of such consequence, I had rather be convinced\r\nby argument than by authority. So if I don't seem to you very wide of\r\nthe mark, a line or two from you in return, intimating your concurrence,\r\nwill be sufficient to confirm me in my opinion: on the other hand, if\r\nyou should think me mistaken, let me have your objections at full\r\nlength. Does it not look rather like bribery, my requiring only a short\r\nletter, if you agree with me; but a very long one if you should be of a\r\ndifferent opinion. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV -- To PATERNUS\r\n\r\nAs I rely very much upon the soundness of your judgment, so I do upon\r\nthe goodness of your eyes: not because I think your discernment very\r\ngreat (for I don't want to make you conceited), but because I think it\r\nas good as mine: which, it must be confessed, is saying a great deal.\r\nJoking apart, I like the look of the slaves which were purchased for me\r\non your recommendation very well; all I further care about is, that they\r\nbe honest: and for this I must depend upon their characters more than\r\ntheir countenances. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI -- To CATILIUS SEVERUS [27]\r\n\r\nI AM at present (and have been a considerable time) detained in Rome,\r\nunder the most stunning apprehensions. Titus Aristo,[28] whom I have a\r\nsingular admiration and affection for, is fallen into a long and\r\nobstinate illness, which troubles me. Virtue, knowledge, and good sense,\r\nshine out with so superior a lustre in this excellent man that learning\r\nherself, and every valuable endowment, seem involved in the danger of\r\nhis single person. How consummate his knowledge, both in the political\r\nand civil laws of his country! How thoroughly conversant is he in every\r\nbranch of history or antiquity? In a word, there is nothing you might\r\nwish to know which he could not teach you. As for me, whenever I would\r\nacquaint myself with any abstruse point, I go to him as my store-house.\r\nWhat an engaging sincerity, what dignity in his conversation! how\r\nchastened and becoming is his caution! Though he conceives, at once,\r\nevery point in debate, yet he is as slow to decide as he is quick to\r\napprehend; calmly and deliberately sifting and weighing every opposite\r\nreason that is offered, and tracing it, with a most judicious\r\npenetration, from its source through all its remotest consequences. His\r\ndiet is frugal, his dress plain; and whenever I enter his chamber, and\r\nview him reclined upon his couch, I consider the scene before me as a\r\ntrue image of ancient simplicity, to which his illustrious mind reflects\r\nthe noblest ornament. He places no part of his happiness in ostentation,\r\nbut in the secret approbation of his conscience, seeking the reward of\r\nhis virtue, not in the clamorous applauses of the world, but in the\r\nsilent satisfaction which results from having acted well. In short, you\r\nwill not easily find his equal, even among our philosophers by outward\r\nprofession. No, he does not frequent the gymnasia or porticoes[29] nor\r\ndoes he amuse his own and others' leisure with endless controversies,\r\nbut busies himself in the scenes of civil and active life. Many has he\r\nassisted with his interest, still more with his advice, and withal in\r\nthe practice of temperance, piety, justice, and fortitude, he has no\r\nsuperior. You would be astonished, were you there to see, at the\r\npatience with which he bears his illness, how he holds out against pain,\r\nendures thirst, and quietly submits to this raging fever and to the\r\npressure of those clothes which are laid upon him to promote\r\nperspiration. He lately called me and a few more of his particular\r\nfriends to his bedside, requesting us to ask his physicians what turn\r\nthey apprehended his distemper would take; that, if they pronounced it\r\nincurable, he might voluntarily put an end to his life; but if there\r\nwere hopes of a recovery, how tedious and difficult soever it might\r\nprove, he would calmly wait the event; for so much, he thought, was due\r\nto the tears and entreaties of his wife and daughter, and to the\r\naffectionate intercession of his friends, as not voluntarily to abandon\r\nour hopes, if they were not entirely desperate. A true hero's resolution\r\nthis, in my estimation, and worthy the highest applause. Instances are\r\nfrequent in the world, of rushing into the arms of death without\r\nreflection and by a sort of blind impulse but deliberately to weigh the\r\nreasons for life or death, and to be determined in our choice as either\r\nside of the scale prevails, shows a great mind. We have had the\r\nsatisfaction to receive the opinion of his physicians in his favour: may\r\nheaven favour their promises and relieve me at length from this painful\r\nanxiety. Once easy in my mind, I shall go back to my favourite\r\nLaurentum, or, in other words, to my books, my papers and studious\r\nleisure. Just now, so much of my time and thoughts are taken up in\r\nattendance upon my friend, and anxiety for him, that I have neither\r\nleisure nor inclination for any reading or writing whatever. Thus you\r\nhave my fears, my wishes, and my after-plans. Write me in return, but in\r\na gayer strain, an account not only of what you are and have been doing,\r\nbut of what you intend doing too. It will be a very sensible consolation\r\nto me in this disturbance of mind, to be assured that yours is easy.\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII -- To VOCONIUS ROMANUS\r\n\r\nROME has not for many years beheld a more magnificent and memorable\r\nspectacle than was lately exhibited in the public funeral of that great,\r\nillustrious, and no less fortunate man, Verginius Rufus. He lived thirty\r\nyears after he had reached the zenith of his fame. He read poems\r\ncomposed in his honour, he read histories of his achievements, and was\r\nhimself witness of his fame among posterity. He was thrice raised to the\r\ndignity of consul, that he might at least be the highest of subjects,\r\nwho[30] had refused to be the first of princes. As he escaped the\r\nresentment of those emperors to whom his virtues had given umbrage and\r\neven rendered him odious, and ended his days when this best of princes,\r\nthis friend of mankind[31] was in quiet possession of the empire, it\r\nseems as if Providence had purposely preserved him to these times, that\r\nhe might receive the honour of a public funeral. He reached his eighty-\r\nfourth year, in full tranquillity and universally revered, having\r\nenjoyed strong health during his lifetime, with the exception of a\r\ntrembling in his hands, which, however, gave him no pain. His last\r\nillness, indeed, was severe and tedious, but even that circumstance\r\nadded to his reputation. As he was practising his voice with a view of\r\nreturning his public acknowledgements to the emperor, who had promoted\r\nhim to the consulship, a large volume he had taken into his hand, and\r\nwhich happened to be too heavy for so old a man to hold standing up,\r\nslid from his grasp. In hastily endeavouring to recover it, his foot\r\nslipped on the smooth pavement, and he fell down and broke his thigh-\r\nbone, which being clumsily set, his age as well being against him, did\r\nnot properly unite again. The funeral obsequies paid to the memory of\r\nthis great man have done honour to the emperor, to the age, and to the\r\nbar. The consul Cornelius Tacitus[32] pronounced his funeral oration and\r\nthus his good fortune was crowned by the public applause of so eloquent\r\nan orator. He has departed from our midst, full of years, indeed, and of\r\nglory; as illustrious by the honours he refused as by those he accepted.\r\nYet still we shall miss him and lament him, as the shining model of a\r\npast age; I, especially, shall feel his loss, for I not only admired him\r\nas a patriot, but loved him as a friend. We were of the same province,\r\nand of neighbouring towns, and our estates were also contiguous. Besides\r\nthese accidental connections, he was left my guardian, and always\r\ntreated me with a parent's affection. Whenever I offered myself as a\r\ncandidate for any office in the state, he constantly supported me with\r\nhis interest; and although he had long since given up all such services\r\nto friends, he would kindly leave his retirement and come to give me his\r\nvote in person. On the day on which the priests nominate those they\r\nconsider most worthy of the sacred office[33] he constantly proposed me.\r\nEven in his last illness, apprehending the possibility of the senate's\r\nappointing him one of the five commissioners for reducing the public\r\nexpenses, he fixed upon me, young as I am, to bear his excuses, in\r\npreference to so many other friends, elderly men too, and of consular\r\nrank and said to me, \"Had I a son of my own, I would entrust you with\r\nthis matter.\" And so I cannot but lament his death, as though it were\r\npremature, and pour out my grief into your bosom; if indeed one has any\r\nright to grieve, or to call it death at all, which to such a man\r\nterminates his mortality, rather than ends his life. He lives, and will\r\nlive on for ever; and his fame will extend and be more celebrated by\r\nposterity, now that he is gone from our sight. I had much else to write\r\nto you but my mind is full of this. I keep thinking of Verginius: I see\r\nhim before me: I am for ever fondly yet vividly imagining that I hear\r\nhim, am speaking to him, embrace him. There are men amongst us, his\r\nfellow-citizens, perhaps, who may rival him in virtue; but not one that\r\nwill ever approach him in glory. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII -- To NEPOS\r\n\r\nTHE great fame of Isaeus had already preceded him here; but we find him\r\neven more wonderful than we had heard. He possesses the utmost\r\nreadiness, copiousness, and abundance of language: he always speaks\r\nextempore, and his lectures are as finished as though he had spent a\r\nlong time over their written composition. His style is Greek, or rather\r\nthe genuine Attic. His exordiums are terse, elegant, attractive, and\r\noccasionally impressive and majestic. He suggests several subjects for\r\ndiscussion, allows his audience their choice, sometimes to even name\r\nwhich side he shall take, rises, arranges himself, and begins. At once\r\nhe has everything almost equally at command. Recondite meanings of\r\nthings are suggested to you, and words--what words they are! exquisitely\r\nchosen and polished. These extempore speeches of his show the wideness\r\nof his reading, and how much practice he has had in composition. His\r\npreface is to the point, his narrative lucid, his summing up forcible,\r\nhis rhetorical ornament imposing. In a word, he teaches, entertains, and\r\naffects you; and you are at a loss to decide which of the three he does\r\nbest. His reflections are frequent, his syllogisms also are frequent,\r\ncondensed, and carefully finished, a result not easily attainable even\r\nwith the pen. As for his memory, you would hardly believe what it is\r\ncapable of. He repeats from a long way back what he has previously\r\ndelivered extempore, without missing a single word. This marvellous\r\nfaculty he has acquired by dint of great application and practice, for\r\nnight and day he does nothing, hears nothing, says nothing else. He has\r\npassed his sixtieth year and is still only a rhetorician, and I know no\r\nclass of men more single-hearted, more genuine, more excellent than this\r\nclass. We who have to go through the rough work of the bar and of real\r\ndisputes unavoidably contract a certain unprincipled adroitness. The\r\nschool, the lecture-room, the imaginary case, all this, on the other\r\nhand, is perfectly innocent and harmless, and equally enjoyable,\r\nespecially to old people, for what can be happier at that time of life\r\nthan to enjoy what we found pleasantest in our young days? I consider\r\nIsaeus then, not only the most eloquent, but the happiest, of men, and\r\nif you are not longing to make his acquaintance, you must be made of\r\nstone and iron. So, if not upon my account, or for any other reason,\r\ncome, for the sake of hearing this man, at least. Have you never read of\r\na certain inhabitant of Cadiz who was so impressed with the name and\r\nfame of Livy that he came from the remotest corner of the earth on\r\npurpose to see him, and, his curiosity gratified, went straight home\r\nagain. It is utter want of taste, shows simple ignorance, is almost an\r\nactual disgrace to a man, not to set any high value upon a proficiency\r\nin so pleasing, noble, refining a science. \"I have authors,\" you will\r\nreply, \"here in my own study, just as eloquent.\" True: but then those\r\nauthors you can read at any time, while you cannot always get the\r\nopportunity of hearing eloquence. Besides, as the proverb says, \"The\r\nliving voice is that which sways the soul;\" yes, far more. For\r\nnotwithstanding what one reads is more clearly understood than what one\r\nhears, yet the utterance, countenance, garb, aye and the very gestures\r\nof the speaker, alike concur in fixing an impression upon the mind; that\r\nis, unless we disbelieve the truth of Aeschines' statement, who, after\r\nhe had read to the Rhodians that celebrated speech of Demosthenes, upon\r\ntheir expressing their admiration of it, is said to have added, \"Ah!\r\nwhat would you have said, could you have heard the wild beast himself?\"\r\nAnd Aeschines, if we may take Demosthenes' word for it, was no mean\r\nelocutionist; yet, he could not but confess that the speech would have\r\nsounded far finer from the lips of its author. I am saying all this with\r\na view to persuading you to hear Isaeus, if even for the mere sake of\r\nbeing able to say you have heard him. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX -- To AVITUS\r\n\r\nIT would be a long story, and of no great importance, to tell you by\r\nwhat accident I found myself dining the other day with an individual\r\nwith whom I am by no means intimate, and who, in his own opinion, does\r\nthings in good style and economically as well, but according to mine,\r\nwith meanness and extravagance combined. Some very elegant dishes were\r\nserved up to himself and a few more of us, whilst those placed before\r\nthe rest of the company consisted simply of cheap dishes and scraps.\r\nThere were, in small bottles, three different kinds of wine; not that\r\nthe guest might take their choice, but that they might not have any\r\noption in their power; one kind being for himself, and for us; another\r\nsort for his lesser friends (for it seems he has degrees of friends),\r\nand the third for his own freedmen and ours. My neighbour,[34] reclining\r\nnext me, observing this, asked me if I approved the arrangement. Not at\r\nall, I told him. \"Pray then,\" he asked, \"what is your method upon such\r\noccasions?\" \"Mine,\" I returned, \"is to give all my visitors the same\r\nreception; for when I give an invitation, it is to entertain, not\r\ndistinguish, my company: I place every man upon my own level whom I\r\nadmit to my table.\" \"Not excepting even your freedmen?\" \"Not excepting\r\neven my freedmen, whom I consider on these occasions my guests, as much\r\nas any of the rest.\" He replied, \"This must cost you a great deal.\" \"Not\r\nin the least.\" \"How can that be?\" \"Simply because, although my freedmen\r\ndon't drink the same wine as myself, yet I drink the same as they do.\"\r\nAnd, no doubt about it, if a man is wise enough to moderate his\r\nappetite, he will not find it such a very expensive thing to share with\r\nall his visitors what he takes himself. Restrain it, keep it in, if you\r\nwish to be true economist. You will find temperance a far better way of\r\nsaving than treating other people rudely can be. Why do I say all this?\r\nWhy, for fear a young man of your high character and promise should be\r\nimposed upon by this immoderate luxury which prevails at some tables,\r\nunder the specious notion of frugality. Whenever any folly of this sort\r\nfalls under my eye, I shall, just because I care for you, point it out\r\nto you as an example you ought to shun. Remember, then, nothing is more\r\nto be avoided than this modern alliance of luxury with meanness; odious\r\nenough when existing separate and distinct, but still more hateful where\r\nyou meet with them together. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX -- To MACRINUS\r\n\r\nTHE senate decreed yesterday, on the emperor's motion, a triumphal\r\nstatue to Vestricius Spurinna: not as they would to many others, who\r\nnever were in action, or saw a camp, or heard the sound of a trumpet,\r\nunless at a show; but as it would be decreed to those who have justly\r\nbought such a distinction with their blood, their exertions, and their\r\ndeeds. Spurinna forcibly restored the king of the Bructeri[35] to his\r\nthrone; and this by the noblest kind of victory; for he subdued that\r\nwarlike people by the terror of the mere display of his preparation for\r\nthe campaign. This is his reward as a hero, while, to console him for\r\nthe loss of his son Cottius, who died during his absence upon that\r\nexpedition, they also voted a statue to the youth; a very unusual honour\r\nfor one so young; but the services of the father deserved that the pain\r\nof so severe a wound should be soothed by no common balm. Indeed Cottius\r\nhimself evinced such remarkable promise of the highest qualities that it\r\nis but fitting his short limited term of life should be extended, as it\r\nwere, by this kind of immortality. He was so pure and blameless, so full\r\nof dignity, and commanded such respect, that he might have challenged in\r\nmoral goodness much older men, with whom he now shares equal honours.\r\nHonours, if I am not mistaken, conferred not only to perpetuate the\r\nmemory of the deceased youth, and in consolation to the surviving\r\nfather, but for the sake of public example also. This will rouse and\r\nstimulate our young men to cultivate every worthy principle, when they\r\nsee such rewards bestowed upon one of their own years, provided he\r\ndeserve them: at the same time that men of quality will be encouraged to\r\nbeget children and to have the joy and satisfaction of leaving a worthy\r\nrace behind, if their children survive them, or of so glorious a\r\nconsolation, should they survive their children. Looking at it in this\r\nlight then, I am glad, upon public grounds, that a statue is decreed\r\nCottius: and for my own sake too, just as much; for I loved this most\r\nfavoured, gifted, youth, as ardently as I now grievously miss him\r\namongst us. So that it will be a great satisfaction to me to be able to\r\nlook at this figure from time to time as I pass by, contemplate it,\r\nstand underneath, and walk to and fro before it. For if having the\r\npictures of the departed placed in our homes lightens sorrow, how much\r\nmore those public representations of them which are not only memorials\r\nof their air and countenance, but of their glory and honour besides?\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI To PAISCUS\r\n\r\nAs I know you eagerly embrace every opportunity of obliging me, so there\r\nis no man whom I had rather be under an obligation to. I apply to you,\r\ntherefore, in preference to anyone else, for a favour which I am\r\nextremely desirous of obtaining. You, who are commander-in-chief of a\r\nvery considerable army, have many opportunities of exercising your\r\ngenerosity; and the length of time you have enjoyed that post must have\r\nenabled you to provide for all your own friends. I hope you will now\r\nturn your eyes upon some of mine: as indeed they are but a few Your\r\ngenerous disposition, I know, would be better pleased if the number were\r\ngreater, but one or two will suffice my modest desires; at present I\r\nwill only mention Voconius Romanus. His father was of great distinction\r\namong the Roman knights, and his father-in-law, or, I might more\r\nproperly call him, his second father, (for his affectionate treatment of\r\nVoconius entitles him to that appellation) was still more conspicuous.\r\nHis mother was one of the most considerable ladies of Upper Spain: you\r\nknow what character the people of that province bear, and how remarkable\r\nthey are for their strictness of their manners. As for himself, he\r\nlately held the post of flamen.[36] Now, from the time when we were\r\nfirst students together, I have felt very tenderly attached to him. We\r\nlived under the same roof, in town and country, we joked together, we\r\nshared each other's serious thoughts: for where indeed could I have\r\nfound a truer friend or pleasanter companion than he? In his\r\nconversation, and even in his very voice and countenance, there is a\r\nrare sweetness; as at the bar he displays talents of a high order;\r\nacuteness, elegance, ease, and skill: and he writes such letters too\r\nthat were you to read them you would imagine they had been dictated by\r\nthe Muses themselves. I have a very great affection for him, as he has\r\nfor me. Even in the earlier part of our lives, I warmly embraced every\r\nopportunity of doing him all the good services which then lay in my\r\npower, as I have lately obtained for him from our most gracious\r\nprince[37] the privilege[38] granted to those who have three children: a\r\nfavour which, though Cæsar very rarely bestows, and always with great\r\ncaution, yet he conferred, at my request, in such a matter as to give it\r\nthe air and grace of being his own choice.\r\n\r\nThe best way of showing that I think he deserves the kindnesses he has\r\nalready received from me is by increasing them, especially as he always\r\naccepts my services so gratefully as to deserve more. Thus I have shown\r\nyou what manner of man Romanus is, how thoroughly I have proved his\r\nworth, and how much I love him. Let me entreat you to honour him with\r\nyour patronage in a way suitable to the generosity of your heart, and\r\nthe eminence of your station. But above all let him have your affection;\r\nfor though you were to confer upon him the utmost you have in your power\r\nto bestow, you can give him nothing more valuable than your friendship-\r\nThat you may see he is worthy of it, even to the closest degree of\r\nintimacy, I send you this brief sketch of his tastes, character, his\r\nwhole life, in fact. I should continue my intercessions in his behalf,\r\nbut that I know you prefer not being pressed, and I have already\r\nrepeated them in every line of this letter: for, to show a good reason\r\nfor what one asks is true intercession, and of the most effectual kind.\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII -- To MAIMUS\r\n\r\nYou guessed correctly: I am much engaged in pleading before the Hundred.\r\nThe business there is more fatiguing than pleasant. Trifling,\r\ninconsiderable cases, mostly; it is very seldom that anything worth\r\nspeaking of, either from the importance of the question or the rank of\r\nthe persons concerned, comes before them. There are very few lawyers\r\neither whom I take any pleasure in working with. The rest, a parcel of\r\nimpudent young fellows, many of whom one knows nothing whatever about,\r\ncome here to get some practice in speaking, and conduct themselves so\r\nforwardly and with such utter want of deference that my friend Attilius\r\nexactly hit it, I think, when he made the observation that \"boys set out\r\nat the bar with cases in the Court of the Hundred as they do at school\r\nwith Homer,\" intimating that at both places they begin where they should\r\nend. But in former times (so my elders tell me) no youth, even of the\r\nbest families, was allowed in unless introduced by some person of\r\nconsular dignity. As things are now, since every fence of modesty and\r\ndecorum is broken down, and all distinctions are levelled and\r\nconfounded, the present young generation, so far from waiting to be\r\nintroduced, break in of their own free will. The audience at their heels\r\nare fit attendants upon such orators; a low rabble of hired mercenaries,\r\nsupplied by contract. They get together in the middle of the court,\r\nwhere the dole is dealt round to them as openly as if they were in a\r\ndining-room: and at this noble price they run from court to court. The\r\nGreeks have an appropriate name in their language for this sort of\r\npeople, importing that they are applauders by profession, and we\r\nstigmatize them with the opprobrious title of table-flatterers: yet the\r\ndirty business alluded to increases every day. It was only yesterday two\r\nof my domestic officers, mere striplings, were hired to cheer somebody\r\nor other, at three denarii apiece:[39] that is what the highest\r\neloquence goes for. Upon these terms we fill as many benches as we\r\nplease, and gather a crowd; this is how those rending shouts are raised,\r\nas soon as the individual standing up in the middle of the ring gives\r\nthe signal. For, you must know, these honest fellows, who understand\r\nnothing of what is said, or, if they did, could not hear it, would be at\r\na loss without a signal, how to time their applause: for many of them\r\ndon't hear a syllable, and are as noisy as any of the rest. If, at any\r\ntime, you should happen to be passing by when the court is sitting, and\r\nfeel at all interested to know how any speaker is acquitting himself,\r\nyou have no occasion to give yourself the trouble of getting up on the\r\njudge's platform, no need to listen; it is easy enough to find out, for\r\nyou may be quite sure he that gets most applause deserves it the least.\r\nLargius Licinus was the first to introduce this fashion; but then he\r\nwent no farther than to go round and solicit an audience. I know, I\r\nremember hearing this from my tutor Quinctilian. \"I used,\" he told me,\r\n\"to go and hear Domitius Afer, and as he was pleading once before the\r\nHundred in his usual slow and impressive manner, hearing, close to him,\r\na most immoderate and unusual noise, and being a good deal surprised at\r\nthis, he left off: the noise ceased, and he began again: he was\r\ninterrupted a second time, and a third. At last he enquired who it was\r\nthat was speaking? He was told, Licinus. Upon which, he broke off the\r\ncase, exclaiming, 'Eloquence is no more!'\" The truth is it had only\r\nbegun to decline then, when in Afer's opinion it no longer existed --\r\nwhereas now it is almost extinct. I am ashamed to tell you of the\r\nmincing and affected pronunciation of the speakers, and of the shrill-\r\nvoiced applause with which their effusions are received; nothing seems\r\nwanting to complete this sing-song performance except claps, or rather\r\ncymbals and tambourines. Howlings indeed (for I can call such applause,\r\nwhich would be indecent even in the theatre, by no other name) abound in\r\nplenty. Up to this time the interest of my friends and the consideration\r\nof my early time of life have kept me in this court, as I am afraid they\r\nmight think I was doing it to shirk work rather than to avoid these\r\nindecencies, were I to leave it just yet: however, I go there less\r\nfrequently than I did, and am thus effecting a gradual retreat.\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII -- To GALLUS\r\n\r\nYou are surprised that I am so fond of my Laurentine, or (if you prefer\r\nthe name) my Laurens: but you will cease to wonder when I acquaint you\r\nwith the beauty of the villa, the advantages of its situation, and the\r\nextensive view of the sea-coast. It is only seventeen miles from Rome:\r\nso that when I have finished my business in town, I can pass my evenings\r\nhere after a good satisfactory day's work. There are two different roads\r\nto it: if you go by that of Laurentum, you must turn off at the\r\nfourteenth mile-stone; if by Astia, at the eleventh. Both of them are\r\nsandy in places, which makes it a little heavier and longer by carriage,\r\nbut short and easy on horseback. The landscape affords plenty of\r\nvariety, the view in some places being closed in by woods, in others\r\nextending over broad meadows, where numerous flocks of sheep and herds\r\nof cattle, which the severity of the winter has driven from the\r\nmountains, fatten in the spring warmth, and on the rich pasturage. My\r\nvilla is of a convenient size without being expensive to keep up. The\r\ncourtyard in front is plain, but not mean, through which you enter\r\nporticoes shaped into the form of the letter D, enclosing a small but\r\ncheerful area between. These make a capital retreat for bad weather, not\r\nonly as they are shut in with windows, but particularly as they are\r\nsheltered by a projection of the roof. From the middle of these\r\nporticoes you pass into a bright pleasant inner court, and out of that\r\ninto a handsome hall running out towards the sea-shore; so that when\r\nthere is a south-west breeze, it is gently washed with the waves, which\r\nspend themselves at its base. On every side of this hall there are\r\neither folding-doors or windows equally large, by which means you have a\r\nview from the front and the two sides of three different seas, as it\r\nwere: from the back you see the middle court, the portico, and the area;\r\nand from another point you look through the portico into the courtyard,\r\nand out upon the woods and distant mountains beyond. On the left hand of\r\nthis hall, a little farther from the sea, lies a large drawing-room, and\r\nbeyond that, a second of a smaller size, which has one window to the\r\nrising and another to the setting sun: this as well has a view of the\r\nsea, but more distant and agreeable. The angle formed by the projection\r\nof the dining-room with this drawing-room retains and intensifies the\r\nwarmth of the sun, and this forms our winter quarters and family\r\ngymnasium, which is sheltered from all the winds except those which\r\nbring on clouds, but the clear sky comes out again before the warmth has\r\ngone out of the place. Adjoining this angle is a room forming the\r\nsegment of a circle, the windows of which are so arranged as to get the\r\nsun all through the day: in the walls are contrived a sort of cases,\r\ncontaining a collection of authors who can never be read too often. Next\r\nto this is a bed-room, connected with it by a raised passage furnished\r\nwith pipes, which supply, at a wholesome temperature, and distribute to\r\nall parts of this room, the heat they receive. The rest of this side of\r\nthe house is appropriated to the use of my slaves and freedmen; but most\r\nof the rooms in it are respectable enough to put my guests into. In the\r\nopposite wing is a most elegant, tastefully fitted up bed-room; next to\r\nwhich lies another, which you may call either a large bed-room or a\r\nmodified dining-room; it is very warm and light, not only from the\r\ndirect rays of the sun, but by their reflection from the sea. Beyond\r\nthis is a bed-room with an ante-room, the height of which renders it\r\ncool in summer, its thick walls warm in winter, for it is sheltered,\r\nevery way from the winds. To this apartment another anteroom is joined\r\nby one common wall. From thence you enter into the wide and spacious\r\ncooling-room belonging to the bath, from the opposite walls of which two\r\ncurved basins are thrown out, so to speak; which are more than large\r\nenough if you consider that the sea is close at hand. Adjacent to this\r\nis the anointing-room, then the sweating-room, and beyond that the bath-\r\nheating room: adjoining are two other little bath-rooms, elegantly\r\nrather than sumptuously fitted up: annexed to them is a warm bath of\r\nwonderful construction, in which one can swim and take a view of the sea\r\nat the same time. Not far from this stands the tennis-court, which lies\r\nopen to the warmth of the afternoon sun. From thence you go up a sort of\r\nturret which has two rooms below, with the same number above, besides a\r\ndining-room commanding a very extensive look-out on to the sea, the\r\ncoast, and the beautiful villas scattered along the shore line. At the\r\nother end is a second turret, containing a room that gets the rising and\r\nsetting sun. Behind this is a large store-room and granary, and\r\nunderneath, a spacious dining-room, where only the murmur and break of\r\nthe sea can be heard, even in a storm: it looks out upon the garden, and\r\nthe gestatio,[40] running round the garden. The gestatio is bordered\r\nround with box, and, where that is decayed, with rosemary: for the box,\r\nwherever sheltered by the buildings, grows plentifully, but where it\r\nlies open and exposed to the weather and spray from the sea, though at\r\nsome distance from the latter, it quite withers up. Next the gestatio,\r\nand running along inside it, is a shady vine plantation, the path of\r\nwhich is so soft and easy to the tread that you may walk bare-foot upon\r\nit. The garden is chiefly planted with fig and mulberry trees, to which\r\nthis soil is as favourable as it is averse from all others. Here is a\r\ndining-room, which, though it stands away from the sea enjoys the garden\r\nview which is just as pleasant: two apartments run round the back part\r\nof it, the windows of which look out upon the entrance of the villa, and\r\ninto a fine kitchen-garden. From here extends an enclosed portico which,\r\nfrom its great length, you might take for a public one. It has a range\r\nof windows on either side, but more on the side facing the sea, and\r\nfewer on the garden side, and these, single windows and alternate with\r\nthe opposite rows. In calm, clear, weather these are all thrown open;\r\nbut if it blows, those on the weather side are closed, whilst those away\r\nfrom the wind can remain open without any inconvenience. Before this\r\nenclosed portico lies a terrace fragrant with the scent of violets, and\r\nwarmed by the reflection of the sun from the portico, which, while it\r\nretains the rays, keeps away the north-east wind; and it is as warm on\r\nthis side as it is cool on the side opposite: in the same way it is a\r\nprotection against the wind from the south-west; and thus, in short, by\r\nmeans of its several sides, breaks the force of the winds, from whatever\r\nquarter they may blow. These are some of its winter advantages, they are\r\nstill more appreciable in the summer time; for at that season it throws\r\na shade upon the terrace during the whole of the forenoon, and upon the\r\nadjoining portion of the gestatio and garden in the afternoon, casting a\r\ngreater or less shade on this side or on that as the day increases or\r\ndecreases. But the portico itself is coolest just at the time when the\r\nsun is at its hottest, that is, when the rays fall directly upon the\r\nroof. Also, by opening the windows you let in the western breezes in a\r\nfree current, which prevents the place getting oppressive with close and\r\nstagnant air. At the upper end of the terrace and portico stands a\r\ndetached garden building, which I call my favourite; my favourite\r\nindeed, as I put it up myself. It contains a very warm winter-room, one\r\nside of which looks down upon the terrace, while the other has a view of\r\nthe sea, and both lie exposed to the sun. The bed-room opens on to the\r\ncovered portico by means of folding-doors, while its window looks out\r\nupon the sea. On that side next the sea, and facing the middle wall, is\r\nformed a very elegant little recess, which, by means of transparent[41]\r\nwindows, and a curtain drawn to or aside, can be made part of the\r\nadjoining room, or separated from it. It contains a couch and two\r\nchairs: as you lie upon this couch, from where your feet are you get a\r\npeep of the sea; looking behind you see the neighbouring villas, and\r\nfrom the head you have a view of the woods: these three views may be\r\nseen either separately, from so many different windows, or blended\r\ntogether in one. Adjoining this is a bed-room, which neither the\r\nservants' voices, the murmuring of the sea, the glare of lightning, nor\r\ndaylight itself can penetrate, unless you open the windows. This\r\nprofound tranquillity and seclusion are occasioned by a passage\r\nseparating the wall of this room from that of the garden, and thus, by\r\nmeans of this intervening space, every noise is drowned. Annexed to this\r\nis a tiny stove-room, which, by opening or shutting a little aperture,\r\nlets out or retains the heat from underneath, according as you require.\r\nBeyond this lie a bed-room and ante-room, which enjoy the sun, though\r\nobliquely indeed, from the time it rises, till the afternoon. When I\r\nretire to this garden summer-house, I fancy myself a hundred miles away\r\nfrom my villa, and take especial pleasure in it at the feast of the\r\nSaturnalia,[42] when, by the licence of that festive season, every other\r\npart of my house resounds with my servants' mirth: thus I neither\r\ninterrupt their amusement nor they my studies. Amongst the pleasures and\r\nconveniences of this situation, there is one drawback, and that is, the\r\nwant of running water; but then there are wells about the place, or\r\nrather springs, for they lie close to the surface. And, altogether, the\r\nquality of this coast is remarkable; for dig where you may, you meet,\r\nupon the first turning up of the ground, with a spring of water, quite\r\npure, not in the least salt, although so near the sea. The neighbouring\r\nwoods supply us with all the fuel we require, the other necessaries\r\nOstia furnishes. Indeed, to a moderate man, even the village (between\r\nwhich and my house there is only one villa) would supply all ordinary\r\nrequirements. It has three public baths, which are a great convenience\r\nif it happen that friends come in unexpectedly, or make too short a stay\r\nto allow time in preparing my own. The whole coast is very pleasantly\r\nsprinkled with villas either in rows or detached, which whether looking\r\nat them from the sea or the shore, present the appearance of so many\r\ndifferent cities. The strand is, sometimes, after a long calm, perfectly\r\nsmooth, though, in general, through the storms driving the waves upon\r\nit, it is rough and uneven. I cannot boast that our sea is plentiful in\r\nchoice fish; however, it supplies us with capital soles and prawns; but\r\nas to other kinds of provisions, my villa aspires to excel even inland\r\ncountries, particularly in milk: for the cattle come up there from the\r\nmeadows in large numbers, in pursuit of water and shade. Tell me, now,\r\nhave I not good reason for living in, staying in, loving, such a\r\nretreat, which, if you feel no appetite for, you must be morbidly\r\nattached to town? And I only wish you would feel inclined to come down\r\nto it, that to so many charms with which my little villa abounds, it\r\nmight have the very considerable addition of your company to recommend\r\nit. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV -- To CEREALIS\r\n\r\nYou advise me to read my late speech before an assemblage of my friends.\r\nI shall do so, as you advise it, though I have strong scruples.\r\nCompositions of this sort lose, I well know, all their force and fire,\r\nand even their very name almost, by a mere recital. It is the solemnity\r\nof the tribunal, the concourse of advocates, the suspense of the event,\r\nthe fame of the several pleaders concerned, the different parties formed\r\namongst the audience; add to this the gestures, the pacing, aye the\r\nactual running, to and fro, of the speaker, the body working[43] in\r\nharmony with every inward emotion, that conspire to give a spirit and a\r\ngrace to what he delivers. This is the reason that those who plead\r\nsitting, though they retain most of the advantages possessed by those\r\nwho stand up to plead, weaken the whole force of their oratory. The eyes\r\nand hands of the reader, those important instruments of graceful\r\nelocution, being engaged, it is no wonder that the attention of the\r\naudience droops, without anything extrinsic to keep it up, no\r\nallurements of gesture to attract, no smart, stinging impromptus to\r\nenliven. To these general considerations I must add this particular\r\ndisadvantage which attends the speech in question, that it is of the\r\nargumentative kind; and it is natural for an author to infer that what\r\nhe wrote with labour will not be read with pleasure. For who is there so\r\nunprejudiced as not to prefer the attractive and sonorous to the sombre\r\nand unornamented in style? It is very unreasonable that there should be\r\nany distinction; however, it is certain the judges generally expect one\r\nstyle of pleading, and the audience another; whereas an auditor ought to\r\nbe affected only by those parts which would especially strike him, were\r\nhe in the place of the judge. Nevertheless it is possible the objections\r\nwhich lie against this piece may be surmounted in consideration of the\r\nnovelty it has to recommend it: the novelty I mean with respect to us;\r\nfor the Greek orators have a method of reasoning upon a different\r\noccasion, not altogether unlike that which I have employed. They, when\r\nthey would throw out a law, as contrary to some former one unrepealed,\r\nargue by comparing those together; so I, on the contrary, endeavour to\r\nprove that the crime, which I was insisting upon as falling within the\r\nintent and meaning of the law relating to public extortions, was\r\nagreeable, not only to that law, but likewise to other laws of the same\r\nnature. Those who are ignorant of the jurisprudence of their country can\r\nhave no taste for reasonings of this kind, but those who are not ought\r\nto be proportionably the more favourable in the judgments they pass upon\r\nthem. I shall endeavour, therefore, if you persist in my reciting it, to\r\ncollect as learned an audience as I can. But before you determine this\r\npoint, do weigh impartially the different considerations I have laid\r\nbefore you, and then decide as reason shall direct; for it is reason\r\nthat must justify you; obedience to your commands will be a sufficient\r\napology for me. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV -- To CALVISIUS\r\n\r\nGIVE me a penny, and I will tell you a story \"worth gold,\" or, rather,\r\nyou shall hear two or three; for one brings to my mind another. It makes\r\nno difference with which I begin. Verania, the widow of Piso, the Piso,\r\nI mean, whom Galba adopted, lay extremely ill, and Regulus paid her a\r\nvisit. By the way, mark the assurance of the man, visiting a lady who\r\ndetested him herself, and to whose husband he was a declared enemy! Even\r\nbarely to enter her house would have been bad enough, but he actually\r\nwent and seated himself by her bed-side and began enquiring on what day\r\nand hour she was born. Being informed of these important particulars, he\r\ncomposes his countenance, fixes his eyes, mutters something to himself,\r\ncounts upon his fingers, and all this merely to keep the poor sick lady\r\nin suspense. When he had finished, \"You are,\" he says, \"in one of your\r\nclimacterics; however, you will get over it. But for your greater\r\nsatisfaction, I will consult with a certain diviner, whose skill I have\r\nfrequently experienced.\" Accordingly off he goes, performs a sacrifice,\r\nand returns with the strongest assurances that the omens confirmed what\r\nhe had promised on the part of the stars. Upon this the good woman,\r\nwhose danger made her credulous, calls for her will and gives Regulus a\r\nlegacy. She grew worse shortly after this; and in her last moments\r\nexclaimed against this wicked, treacherous, and worse than perjured\r\nwretch, who had sworn falsely to her by his own son's life. But\r\nimprecations of this sort are as common with Regulus as they are\r\nimpious; and he continually devotes that unhappy youth to the curse of\r\nthose gods whose vengeance his own frauds every day provoke.\r\n\r\nVelleius Blaesus, a man of consular rank, and remarkable for his immense\r\nwealth, in his last illness was anxious to make some alterations in his\r\nwill. Regulus, who had lately endeavoured to insinuate himself into his\r\ngood graces, hoped to get something from the new will, and accordingly\r\naddresses himself to his physicians, and conjures them to exert all\r\ntheir skill to prolong the poor man's life. But after the will was\r\nsigned, he changes his character, reversing his tone: \"How long,\" says\r\nhe to these very same physicians, \"do you intend keeping this man in\r\nmisery? Since you cannot preserve his life, why do you grudge him the\r\nhappy release of death?\" Blaesus dies, and, as if he had overheard every\r\nword that Regulus had said, has not left him one farthing.--And now have\r\nyou had enough? or are you for the third, according to rhetorical canon?\r\nIf so, Regulus will supply you. You must know, then, that Aurelia, a\r\nlady of remarkable accomplishments, purposing to execute her will,[44]\r\nhad put on her smartest dress for the occasion. Regulus, who was present\r\nas a witness, turned to the lady, and \"Pray,\" says he, \"leave me these\r\nfine clothes.\" Aurelia thought the man was joking: but he insisted upon\r\nit perfectly seriously, and, to be brief, obliged her to open her will,\r\nand insert the dress she had on as a legacy to him, watching as she\r\nwrote, and then looking over it to see that it was all down correctly.\r\nAurelia, however, is still alive: though Regulus, no doubt, when he\r\nsolicited this bequest, expected to enjoy it pretty soon. The fellow\r\ngets estates, he gets legacies, conferred upon him, as if he really\r\ndeserved them! But why should I go on dwelling upon this in a city where\r\nwickedness and knavery have, for this time past, received, the same, do\r\nI say, nay, even greater encouragement, than modesty and virtue? Regulus\r\nis a glaring instance of this truth, who, from a state of poverty, has\r\nby a train of villainies acquired such immense riches that he once told\r\nme, upon consulting the omens to know how soon he should be worth sixty\r\nmillions of sesterces,[45] he found them so favourable as to portend he\r\nshould possess double that sum. And possibly he may, if he continues to\r\ndictate wills for other people in this way: a sort of fraud, in my\r\nopinion, the most infamous of any. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI -- To CALVISIUS\r\n\r\nI NEVER, I think, spent any time more agreeably than my time lately with\r\nSpurinna. So agreeably, indeed, that if ever I should arrive at old age,\r\nthere is no man whom I would sooner choose for my model, for nothing can\r\nbe more perfect in arrangement than his mode of life. I look upon order\r\nin human actions, especially at that advanced age, with the same sort of\r\npleasure as I behold the settled course of the heavenly bodies. In young\r\nmen, indeed, a little confusion and disarrangement is all well enough:\r\nbut in age, when business is unseasonable, and ambition indecent, all\r\nshould be composed and uniform. This rule Spurinna observes with the\r\nmost religious consistency. Even in those matters which one might call\r\ninsignificant, were they not of every-day occurrence, he observes a\r\ncertain periodical season and method. The early morning he passes on his\r\ncouch; at eight he calls for his slippers, and walks three miles,\r\nexercising mind and body together. On his return, if he has any friends\r\nin the house with him, he gets upon some entertaining and interesting\r\ntopic of conversation; if by himself, some book is read to him,\r\nsometimes when visitors are there even, if agreeable to the company.\r\nThen he has a rest, and after that either takes up a book or resumes his\r\nconversation in preference to reading. By-and-by he goes out for a drive\r\nin his carriage, either with his wife, a most admirable woman, or with\r\nsome friend: a happiness which lately was mine.--How agreeable, how\r\ndelightful it is getting a quiet time alone with him in this way! You\r\ncould imagine you were listening to some worthy of ancient times! What\r\ndeeds, what men you hear about, and with what noble precepts you are\r\nimbued! Yet all delivered with so modest an air that there is not the\r\nleast appearance of dictating. When he has gone about seven miles, he\r\ngets out of his chariot and walks a mile more, after which he returns\r\nhome, and either takes a rest or goes back to his couch and writing. For\r\nhe composes most elegant lyrics both in Greek and Latin. So wonderfully\r\nsoft, sweet, and gay they are, while the author's own unsullied life\r\nlends them additional charm. When the baths are ready, which in winter\r\nis about three o'clock, and in summer about two, he undresses himself\r\nand, if there happen to be no wind, walks for some time in the sun.\r\nAfter this he has a good brisk game of tennis: for by this sort of\r\nexercise too, he combats the effects of old age. When he has bathed, he\r\nthrows himself upon his couch, but waits a little before he begins\r\neating, and in the meanwhile has some light and entertaining author read\r\nto him. In this, as in all the rest, his friends are at full liberty to\r\nshare; or to employ themselves in any other way, just as they prefer.\r\nYou sit down to an elegant dinner, without extravagant display, which is\r\nserved up in antique plate of pure silver. He has another complete\r\nservice in Corinthian metal, which, though he admires as a curiosity, is\r\nfar from being his passion. During dinner he is frequently entertained\r\nwith the recital of some dramatic piece, by way of seasoning his very\r\npleasures with study; and although he continues at the table, even in\r\nsummer, till the night is somewhat advanced, yet he prolongs the\r\nentertainment with so much affability and politeness that none of his\r\nguests ever finds it tedious. By this method of living he has preserved\r\nall his senses entire, and his body vigorous and active to his seventy-\r\neighth year, without showing any sign of old age except wisdom. This is\r\nthe sort of life I ardently aspire after; as I purpose enjoying it when\r\nI shall arrive at those years which will justify a retreat from active\r\nlife. Meanwhile I am embarrassed with a thousand affairs, in which\r\nSpurinna is at once my support and my example: for he too, so long as it\r\nbecame him, discharged his professional duties, held magistracies,\r\ngoverned provinces, and by toiling hard earned the repose he now enjoys.\r\nI propose to myself the same career and the same limits: and I here give\r\nit to you under my hand that I do so. If an ill-timed ambition should\r\ncarry me beyond those bounds, produce this very letter of mine in court\r\nagainst me; and condemn me to repose, whenever I enjoy it without being\r\nreproached with indolence. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII -- To BAEBIUS MACER\r\n\r\nIT gives me great pleasure to find you such a reader of my uncle's works\r\nas to wish to have a complete collection of them, and to ask me for the\r\nnames of them all. I will act as index then, and you shall know the very\r\norder in which they were written, for the studious reader likes to know\r\nthis. The first work of his was a treatise in one volume, \"On the Use of\r\nthe Dart by Cavalry\"; this he wrote when in command of one of the\r\ncavalry corps of our allied troops, and is drawn up with great care and\r\ningenuity. \"The Life of Pomponius Secundus,\"[46] in two volumes.\r\nPomponius had a great affection for him, and he thought he owed this\r\ntribute to his memory. \"The History of the Wars in Germany,\" in twenty\r\nbooks, in which he gave an account of all the battles we were engaged in\r\nagainst that nation. A dream he had while serving in the army in Germany\r\nfirst suggested the design of this work to him. He imagined that Drusus\r\nNero[47] (who extended his conquest very far into that country, and\r\nthere lost his life) appeared to him in his sleep, and entreated him to\r\nrescue his memory from oblivion. Next comes a work entitled \"The\r\nStudent,\" in three parts, which from their length spread into six\r\nvolumes: a work in which is discussed the earliest training and\r\nsubsequent education of the orator. \"Questions of Grammar and Style,\" in\r\neight books, written in the latter part of Nero's reign, when the\r\ntyranny of the times made it dangerous to engage in literary pursuits\r\nrequiring freedom and elevation of tone. He has completed the history\r\nwhich Aufidius Bassus[48] left unfinished, and has added to it thirty\r\nbooks. And lastly he has left thirty-seven books on Natural History, a\r\nwork of great compass and learning, and as full of variety as nature\r\nherself. You will wonder how a man as busy as he was could find time to\r\ncompose so many books, and some of them too involving such care and\r\nlabour. But you will be still more surprised when you hear that he\r\npleaded at the bar for some time, that he died in his sixty-sixth year,\r\nthat the intervening time was employed partly in the execution of the\r\nhighest official duties, partly in attendance upon those emperors who\r\nhonoured him with their friendship. But he had a quick apprehension,\r\nmarvellous power of application, and was of an exceedingly wakeful\r\ntemperament. He always began to study at midnight at the time of the\r\nfeast of Vulcan, not for the sake of good luck, but for learning's sake;\r\nin winter generally at one in the morning, but never later than two, and\r\noften at twelve.[49] He was a most ready sleeper, insomuch that he would\r\nsometimes, whilst in the midst of his studies, fall off and then wake up\r\nagain. Before day-break he used to wait upon Vespasian' (who also used\r\nhis nights for transacting business in), and then proceed to execute the\r\norders he had received. As soon as he returned home, he gave what time\r\nwas left to study. After a short and light refreshment at noon\r\n(agreeably to the good old custom of our ancestors) he would frequently\r\nin the summer, if he was disengaged from business, lie down and bask in\r\nthe sun; during which time some author was read to him, while he took\r\nnotes and made extracts, for every book he read he made extracts out of,\r\nindeed it was a maxim of his, that \"no book was so bad but some good\r\nmight be got out of it.\" When this was over, he generally took a cold\r\nbath, then some light refreshment and a little nap. After this, as if it\r\nhad been a new day, he studied till supper-time, when a book was again\r\nread to him, which he would take down running notes upon. I remember\r\nonce his reader having mis-pronounced a word, one of my uncle's friends\r\nat the table made him go back to where the word was and repeat it again;\r\nupon which my uncle said to his friend, \"Surely you understood it?\" Upon\r\nhis acknowledging that he did, \"Why then,\" said he, \"did you make him go\r\nback again? We have lost more than ten lines by this interruption.\" Such\r\nan economist he was of time! In the summer he used to rise from supper\r\nat daylight, and in winter as soon as it was dark: a rule he observed as\r\nstrictly as if it had been a law of the state. Such was his manner of\r\nlife amid the bustle and turmoil of the town: but in the country his\r\nwhole time was devoted to study, excepting only when he bathed. In this\r\nexception I include no more than the time during which he was actually\r\nin the bath; for all the while he was being rubbed and wiped, he was\r\nemployed either in hearing some book read to him or in dictating\r\nhimself. In going about anywhere, as though he were disengaged from all\r\nother business, he applied his mind wholly to that single pursuit. A\r\nshorthand writer constantly attended him, with book and tablets, who, in\r\nthe winter, wore a particular sort of warm gloves, that the sharpness of\r\nthe weather might not occasion any interruption to my uncle's studies:\r\nand for the same reason, when in Rome, he was always carried in a chair.\r\nI recollect his once taking me to task for walking. \"You need not,\" he\r\nsaid, \"lose these hours.\" For he thought every hour gone that was not\r\ngiven to study. Through this extraordinary application he found time to\r\ncompose the several treatises I have mentioned, besides one hundred and\r\nsixty volumes of extracts which he left me in his will, consisting of a\r\nkind of common-place, written on both sides, in very small hand, so that\r\none might fairly reckon the number considerably more. He used himself to\r\ntell us that when he was comptroller of the revenue in Spain, he could\r\nhave sold these manuscripts to Largius Licinus for four hundred thousand\r\nsesterces,[50] and then there were not so many of them. When you\r\nconsider the books he has read, and the volumes he has written, are you\r\nnot inclined to suspect that he never was engaged in public duties or\r\nwas ever in the confidence of his prince? On the other hand, when you\r\nare told how indefatigable he was in his studies, are you not inclined\r\nto wonder that he read and wrote no more than he did? For, on one side,\r\nwhat obstacles would not the business of a court throw in his way? and\r\non the other, what is it that such intense application might not effect?\r\nIt amuses me then when I hear myself called a studious man, who in\r\ncomparison with him am the merest idler. But why do I mention myself,\r\nwho am diverted from these pursuits by numberless affairs both public\r\nand private? Who amongst those whose whole lives are devoted to literary\r\npursuits would not blush and feel himself the most confirmed of\r\nsluggards by the side of him? I see I have run out my letter farther\r\nthan I had originally intended, which was only to let you know, as you\r\nasked me, what works he had left behind him. But I trust this will be no\r\nless acceptable to you than the books themselves, as it may, possibly,\r\nnot only excite your curiosity to read his works, but also your\r\nemulation to copy his example, by some attempts of a similar nature.\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII -- To ANNIUS SEVERUS\r\n\r\nI HAVE lately purchased with a legacy that was left me a small statue of\r\nCorinthian brass. It is small indeed, but elegant and life-like, as far\r\nas I can form any judgment, which most certainly in matters of this\r\nsort, as perhaps in all others, is extremely defective. However, I do\r\nsee the beauties of this figure: for, as it is naked the faults, if\r\nthere be any, as well as the perfections, are the more observable. It\r\nrepresents an old man, in an erect attitude. The bones, muscles, veins,\r\nand the very wrinkles, give the Impression of breathing life. The hair\r\nis thin and failing, the forehead broad, the face shrivelled, the throat\r\nlank, the arms loose and hanging, the breast shrunken, and the belly\r\nfallen in, as the whole turn and air of the figure behind too is equally\r\nexpressive of old age. It appears to be true antique, judging from the\r\ncolour of the brass. In short, it is such a masterpiece as would strike\r\nthe eyes of a connoisseur, and which cannot fail to charm an ordinary\r\nobserver: and this induced me, who am an absolute novice in this art, to\r\nbuy it. But I did so, not with any intention of placing it in my own\r\nhouse (for I have nothing of the kind there), but with a design of\r\nfixing it in some conspicuous place in my native province; I should like\r\nit best in the temple of Jupiter, for it is a gift well worthy of a\r\ntemple, well worthy of a god. I desire therefore you would, with that\r\ncare with which you always perform my requests, undertake this\r\ncommission and give immediate orders for a pedestal to be made for it,\r\nout of what marble you please, but let my name be engraved upon it, and,\r\nif you think proper to add these as well, my titles. I will send the\r\nstatue by the first person I can find who will not mind the trouble of\r\nit; or possibly (which I am sure you will like better) I may myself\r\nbring it along with me: for I intend, if business can spare me that is\r\nto say, to make an excursion over to you. I see joy in your looks when I\r\npromise to come; but you will soon change your countenance when I add,\r\nonly for a few days: for the same business that at present keeps me here\r\nwill prevent my making a longer stay. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX -- To CANINIUS RUFUS\r\n\r\nI HAVE just been informed that Silius Italicus[51] has starved himself\r\nto death, at his villa near Naples. Ill-health was the cause. Being\r\ntroubled with an incurable cancerous humour, he grew weary of life and\r\ntherefore put an end to it with a determination not to be moved. He had\r\nbeen extremely fortunate all through his life with the exception of the\r\ndeath of the younger of his two sons; however, he has left behind him\r\nthe elder and the worthier man of the two in a position of distinction,\r\nhaving even attained consular rank. His reputation had suffered a little\r\nin Nero's time, as he was suspected of having officiously joined in some\r\nof the informations in that reign; but he used his interest with\r\nVitellius, with great discretion and humanity. He acquired considerable\r\nhonour by his administration of the government of Asia, and, by his good\r\nconduct after his retirement from business, cleared his character from\r\nthat stain which his former public exertions had thrown upon it. He\r\nlived as a private nobleman, without power, and consequently without\r\nenvy. Though he was frequently confined to his bed, and always to his\r\nroom, yet he was highly respected, and much visited; not with an\r\ninterested view, but on his own account. He employed his time between\r\nconversing with literary men and composing verses; which he sometimes\r\nread out, by way of testing the public opinion: but they evidence more\r\nindustry than genius. In the decline of his years he entirely quitted\r\nRome, and lived altogether in Campania, from whence even the accession\r\nof the new emperor[52] could not draw him. A circumstance which I\r\nmention as much to the honour of Cæsar, who was not displeased with that\r\nliberty, as of Italicus, who was not afraid to make use of it. He was\r\nreproached with indulging his taste for the fine arts at an immoderate\r\nexpense. He had several villas in the same province, and the last\r\npurchase was always the especial favourite, to the neglect of all the\r\nrest, These residences overflowed with books, statues, and pictures,\r\nwhich he more than enjoyed, he even adored; particularly that of Virgil,\r\nof whom he was so passionate an admirer that he celebrated the\r\nanniversary of that poet's birthday with more solemnity than his own, at\r\nNaples especially where he used to approach his tomb as if it had been a\r\ntemple. In this tranquillity he passed his seventy-fifth year, with a\r\ndelicate rather than an infirm constitution.\r\n\r\nAs he was the last person upon whom Nero conferred the consular office,\r\nso he was the last survivor of all those who had been raised by him to\r\nthat dignity. It is also remarkable that, as he was the last to die of\r\nNero's consuls, so Nero died when he was consul. Recollecting this, a\r\nfeeling of pity for the transitory condition of mankind comes over me.\r\nIs there anything in nature so short and limited as human life, even at\r\nits longest? Does it not seem to you but yesterday that Nero was alive?\r\nAnd yet not one of all those who were consuls in his reign now remains!\r\nThough why should I wonder at this? Lucius Piso (the father of that Piso\r\nwho was so infamously assassinated by Valerius Festus in Africa) used to\r\nsay, he did not see one person in the senate whose opinion he had\r\nconsulted when he was consul: in so short a space is the very term of\r\nlife of such a multitude of beings comprised! so that to me those royal\r\ntears seem not only worthy of pardon but of praise. For it is said that\r\nXerxes, on surveying his immense army, wept at the reflection that so\r\nmany thousand lives would in such a short space of time be extinct. The\r\nmore ardent therefore should be our zeal to lengthen out this frail and\r\ntransient portion of existence, if not by our deeds (for the\r\nopportunities of this are not in our power) yet certainly by our\r\nliterary accomplishments; and since long life is denied us, let us\r\ntransmit to posterity some memorial that we have at least LIVED. I well\r\nknow you need no incitements, but the warmth of my affection for you\r\ninclines me to urge you on in the course you are already pursuing, just\r\nas you have so often urged me. \"Happy rivalry\" when two friends strive\r\nin this way which of them shall animate the other most in their mutual\r\npursuit of immortal fame. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX -- To SPURINNA AND COTTIA[53]\r\n\r\nI DID not tell you, when I paid you my last visit, that I had composed\r\nsomething in praise of your son; because, in the first place, I wrote it\r\nnot for the sake of talking about my performance, but simply to satisfy\r\nmy affection, to console my sorrow for the loss of him. Again, as you\r\ntold me, my dear Spurinna, that you had heard I had been reciting a\r\npiece of mine, I imagined you had also heard at the same time what was\r\nthe subject of the recital, and besides I was afraid of casting a gloom\r\nover your cheerfulness in that festive season, by reviving the\r\nremembrance of that heavy sorrow. And even now I have hesitated a little\r\nwhether I should gratify you both, in your joint request, by sending\r\nonly what I recited, or add to it what I am thinking of keeping back for\r\nanother essay. It does not satisfy my feelings to devote only one little\r\ntract to a memory so dear and sacred to me, and it seemed also more to\r\nthe interest of his fame to have it thus disseminated by separate\r\npieces. But the consideration, that it will be more open and friendly to\r\nsend you the whole now, rather than keep back some of it to another\r\ntime, has determined me to do the former, especially as I have your\r\npromise that it shall not be communicated by either of you to anyone\r\nelse, until I shall think proper to publish it. The only remaining\r\nfavour I ask is, that you will give me a proof of the same unreserve by\r\npointing out to me what you shall judge would be best altered, omitted,\r\nor added. It is difficult for a mind in affliction to concentrate itself\r\nupon such little cares. However, as you would direct a painter or\r\nsculptor who was representing the figure of your son what parts he\r\nshould retouch or express, so I hope you will guide and inform my hand\r\nin this more durable or (as you are pleased to think it) this immortal\r\nlikeness which I am endeavouring to execute: for the truer to the\r\noriginal, the more perfect and finished it is, so much the more lasting\r\nit is likely to prove. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI -- To JULIUS GENITOR\r\n\r\nIT is just like the generous disposition of Artemidorus to magnify the\r\nkindnesses of his friends; hence he praises my deserts (though he is\r\nreally indebted to me) beyond their due. It is true indeed that when the\r\nphilosophers were expelled from Rome,[54] I visited him at his house\r\nnear the city, and ran the greater risk in paying him that civility, as\r\nit was more noticeable then, I being praetor at the time. I supplied him\r\ntoo with a considerable sum to pay certain debts he had contracted upon\r\nvery honourable occasions, without charging interest, though obliged to\r\nborrow the money myself, while the rest of his rich powerful friends\r\nstood by hesitating about giving him assistance. I did this at a time\r\nwhen seven of my friends were either executed or banished; Senecio,\r\nRusticus, and Helvidius having just been put to death, while Mauricus,\r\nGratilla, Arria, and Fannia, were sent into exile; and scorched as it\r\nwere by so many lightning-bolts of the state thus hurled and flashing\r\nround me, I augured by no uncertain tokens my own impending doom. But I\r\ndo not look upon myself, on that account, as deserving of the high\r\npraises my friend bestows upon me: all I pretend to is the being clear\r\nof the infamous guilt of abandoning him in his misfortunes. I had, as\r\nfar as the differences between our ages would admit, a friendship for\r\nhis father-in-law Musonius, whom I both loved and esteemed, while\r\nArtemidorus himself I entered into the closest intimacy with when I was\r\nserving as a military tribune in Syria. And I consider as a proof that\r\nthere is some good in me the fact of my being so early capable of\r\nappreciating a man who is either a philosopher or the nearest\r\nresemblance to one possible; for I am sure that, amongst all those who\r\nat the present day call themselves philosophers, you will find hardly\r\nany one of them so full of sincerity and truth as he. I forbear to\r\nmention how patient he is of heat and cold alike, how indefatigable in\r\nlabour, how abstemious in his food, and what an absolute restraint he\r\nputs upon all his appetites; for these qualities, considerable as they\r\nwould certainly be in any other character, are less noticeable by the\r\nside of the rest of those virtues of his which recommended him to\r\nMusonius for a son-in-law, in preference to so many others of all ranks\r\nwho paid their addresses to his daughter. And when I think of all these\r\nthings, I cannot help feeling pleasurably affected by those unqualified\r\nterms of praise in which he speaks of me to you as well as to everyone\r\nelse. I am only apprehensive lest the warmth of his kind feeling carry\r\nhim beyond the due limits; for he, who is so free from all other errors,\r\nis apt to fall into just this one good-natured one, of overrating the\r\nmerits of his friends. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII -- To CATILIUS SEVERUS\r\n\r\nI WILL come to supper, but must make this agreement beforehand, that I\r\ngo when I please, that you treat me to nothing expensive, and that our\r\nconversation abound only in Socratic discourse, while even that in\r\nmoderation. There are certain necessary visits of ceremony, bringing\r\npeople out before daylight, which Cato himself could not safely fall in\r\nwith; though I must confess that Julius Cæsar reproaches him with that\r\ncircumstance in such a manner as redounds to his praise; for he tells us\r\nthat the persons who met him reeling home blushed at the discovery, and\r\nadds, \"You would have thought that Cato had detected them, and not they\r\nCato.\" Could he place the dignity of Cato in a stronger light than by\r\nrepresenting him thus venerable even in his cups? But let our supper be\r\nas moderate in regard to hours as in the preparation and expense: for we\r\nare not of such eminent reputation that even our enemies cannot censure\r\nour conduct without applauding it at the same time. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII -- To ACILIUS\r\n\r\nTHE atrocious treatment that Largius Macedo, a man of praetorian rank,\r\nlately received at the hands of his slaves is so extremely tragical that\r\nit deserves a place rather in public history than in a private letter;\r\nthough it must at the same time be acknowledged there was a haughtiness\r\nand severity in his behaviour towards them which shewed that he little\r\nremembered, indeed almost entirely forgot, the fact that his own father\r\nhad once been in that station of life. He was bathing at his Formian\r\nVilla, when he found himself suddenly surrounded by his slaves; one\r\nseizes him by the throat, another strikes him on the mouth, whilst\r\nothers trampled upon his breast, stomach, and even other parts which I\r\nneed not mention. When they thought the breath must be quite out of his\r\nbody, they threw him down upon the heated pavement of the bath, to try\r\nwhether he were still alive, where he lay outstretched and motionless,\r\neither really insensible or only feigning to be so, upon which they\r\nconcluded him to be actually dead. In this condition they brought him\r\nout, pretending that he had got suffocated by the heat of the bath. Some\r\nof his more trusty servants received him, and his mistresses came about\r\nhim shrieking and lamenting. The noise of their cries and the fresh air,\r\ntogether, brought him a little to himself; he opened his eyes, moved his\r\nbody, and shewed them (as he now safely might) that he was not quite\r\ndead. The murderers immediately made their escape; but most of them have\r\nbeen caught again, and they are after the rest. He was with great\r\ndifficulty kept alive for a few days, and then expired, having however\r\nthe satisfaction of finding himself as amply revenged in his lifetime as\r\nhe would have been after his death. Thus you see to what affronts,\r\nindignities, and dangers we are exposed. Lenity and kind treatment are\r\nno safeguard; for it is malice and not reflection that arms such\r\nruffians against their masters. So much for this piece of news. And what\r\nelse? What else? Nothing else, or you should hear it, for I have still\r\npaper, and time too (as it is holiday time with me) to spare for more,\r\nand I can tell you one further circumstance relating to Macedo, which\r\nnow occurs to me. As he was in a public bath once, at Rome, a\r\nremarkable, and (judging from the manner of his death) an ominous,\r\naccident happened to him. A slave of his, in order to make way for his\r\nmaster, laid his hand gently upon a Roman knight, who, turning suddenly\r\nround, struck, not the slave who had touched him, but Macedo, so violent\r\na blow with his open palm that he almost knocked him down. Thus the bath\r\nby a kind of gradation proved fatal to him; being first the scene of an\r\nindignity he suffered, afterwards the scene of his death. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV -- To NEPOS\r\n\r\nI HAVE constantly observed that amongst the deeds and sayings of\r\nillustrious persons of either sex, some have made more noise in the\r\nworld, whilst others have been really greater, although less talked\r\nabout; and I am confirmed in this opinion by a conversation I had\r\nyesterday with Fannia. This lady is a grand-daughter to that celebrated\r\nArria, who animated her husband to meet death, by her own glorious\r\nexample. She informed me of several particulars relating to Arria, no\r\nless heroic than this applauded action of hers, though taken less notice\r\nof, and I think you will be as surprised to read the account of them as\r\nI was to hear it. Her husband Caecinna Paetus, and her son, were both\r\nattacked at the same time with a fatal illness, as was supposed; of\r\nwhich the son died, a youth of remarkable beauty, and as modest as he\r\nwas comely, endeared indeed to his parents no less by his many graces\r\nthan from the fact of his being their son. His mother prepared his\r\nfuneral and conducted the usual ceremonies so privately that Paetus did\r\nnot know of his death. Whenever she came into his room, she pretended\r\nher son was alive and actually better: and as often as he enquired after\r\nhis health, would answer, \"He has had a good rest, and eaten his food\r\nwith quite an appetite.\" Then when she found the tears, she had so long\r\nkept back, gushing forth in spite of herself, she would leave the room,\r\nand having given vent to her grief, return with dry eyes and a serene\r\ncountenance, as though she had dismissed every feeling of bereavement at\r\nthe door of her husband's chamber. I must confess it was a brave\r\naction[55] in her to draw the steel, plunge it into her breast, pluck\r\nout the dagger, and present it to her husband with that ever memorable,\r\nI had almost said that divine, expression, \"Paetus, it is not painful.\"\r\nBut when she spoke and acted thus, she had the prospect of glory and\r\nimmortality before her; how far greater, without the support of any such\r\nanimating motives, to hide her tears, to conceal her grief, and\r\ncheerfully to act the mother, when a mother no more!\r\n\r\nScribonianus had taken up arms in Illyria against Clatidius, where he\r\nlost his life, and Paetus, who was of his party, was brought a prisoner\r\nto Rome. When they were going to put him on board ship, Arria besought\r\nthe soldiers that she might be permitted to attend him: \"For surely,\"\r\nshe urged, \"you will allow a man of consular rank some servants to dress\r\nhim, attend to him at meals, and put his shoes on for him; but if you\r\nwill take me, I alone will perform all these offices.\" Her request was\r\nrefused; upon which she hired a fishing-boat, and in that small vessel\r\nfollowed the ship. On her return to Rome, meeting the wife of\r\nScribonianus in the emperor's palace, at the time when this woman\r\nvoluntarily gave evidence against the conspirators--\"What,\" she\r\nexclaimed, \"shall I hear you even speak to me, you, on whose bosom your\r\nhusband Scribonianus was murdered, and yet you survive him?\"--an\r\nexpression which plainly shews that the noble manner in which she put an\r\nend to her life was no unpremeditated effect of sudden passion.\r\nMoreover, when Thrasea, her son-in-law, was endeavouring to dissuade her\r\nfrom her purpose of destroying herself, and, amongst other arguments\r\nwhich he used, said to her, \"Would you then advise your daughter to die\r\nwith me if my life were to be taken from me?\" \"Most certainly I would,\"\r\nshe replied, \"if she had lived as long, and in as much harmony with you,\r\nas I have with my Paetus.\" This answer greatly increased the alarm of\r\nher family, and made them watch her for the future more narrowly; which,\r\nwhen she perceived, \"It is of no use,\" she said, \"you may oblige me to\r\neffect my death in a more painful way, but it is impossible you should\r\nprevent it.\" Saying this, she sprang from her chair, and running her\r\nhead with the utmost violence against the wall, fell down, to all\r\nappearance, dead; but being brought to herself again, \"I told you,\" she\r\nsaid, \"if you would not suffer me to take an easy path to death, I\r\nshould find a way to it, however hard.\" Now, is there not, my friend,\r\nsomething much greater in all this than in the so-much-talked-of\r\n\"Paetus, it is not painful,\" to which these led the way? And yet this\r\nlast is the favourite topic of fame, while all the former are passed\r\nover in silence. Whence I cannot but infer, what I observed at the\r\nbeginning of my letter, that some actions are more celebrated, whilst\r\nothers are really greater. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV -- To SEVERUS\r\n\r\nI WAS obliged by my consular office to compliment the emperor[56] in the\r\nname of the republic; but after I had performed that ceremony in the\r\nsenate in the usual manner, and as fully as the time and place would\r\nallow, I thought it agreeable to the affection of a good subject to\r\nenlarge those general heads, and expand them into a complete discourse.\r\nMy principal object in doing so was, to confirm the emperor in his\r\nvirtues, by paying them that tribute of applause which they so justly\r\ndeserve; and at the same time to direct future princes, not in the\r\nformal way of lecture, but by his more engaging example, to those paths\r\nthey must pursue if they would attain the same heights of glory. To\r\ninstruct princes how to form their conduct, is a noble, but difficult\r\ntask, and may, perhaps, be esteemed an act of presumption: but to\r\napplaud the character of an accomplished prince, and to hold out to\r\nposterity, by this means, a beacon-light as it were, to guide succeeding\r\nmonarchs, is a method equally useful, and much more modest. It afforded\r\nme a very singular pleasure that when I wished to recite this panegyric\r\nin a private assembly, my friends gave me their company, though I did\r\nnot solicit them in the usual form of notes or circulars, but only\r\ndesired their attendance, \"should it be quite convenient to them,\" and\r\n\"if they should happen to have no other engagement.\" You know the\r\nexcuses generally made at Rome to avoid invitations of this kind; how\r\nprior invitations are usually alleged; yet, in spite of the worst\r\npossible weather, they attended the recital for two days together; and\r\nwhen I thought it would be unreasonable to detain them any longer, they\r\ninsisted upon my going through with it the next day. Shall I consider\r\nthis as an honour done to myself or to literature? Rather let me suppose\r\nto the latter, which, though well-nigh extinct, seems to be now again\r\nreviving amongst us. Yet what was the subject which raised this uncommon\r\nattention? No other than what formerly, even in the senate, where we had\r\nto submit to it, we used to grudge even a few moments' attention to. But\r\nnow, you see, we have patience to recite and to attend to the same topic\r\nfor three days together; and the reason of this is, not that we have\r\nmore eloquent writing now than formerly, but we write under a fuller\r\nsense of individual freedom, and consequently more genially than we used\r\nto. It is an additional glory therefore to our present emperor that this\r\nsort of harangue, which was once as disgusting as it was false, is now\r\nas pleasing as it is sincere. But it was not only the earnest attention\r\nof my audience which afforded me pleasure; I was greatly delighted too\r\nwith the justness of their taste: for I observed, that the more nervous\r\nparts of my discourse gave them peculiar satisfaction. It is true,\r\nindeed, this work, which was written for the perusal of the world in\r\ngeneral, was read only to a few; however, I would willingly look upon\r\ntheir particular judgment as an earnest of that of the public, and\r\nrejoice at their manly taste as if it were universally spread. It was\r\njust the same in eloquence as it was in music, the vitiated ears of the\r\naudience introduced a depraved style; but now, I am inclined to hope, as\r\na more refined judgment prevails in the public, our compositions of both\r\nkinds will improve too; for those authors whose sole object is to please\r\nwill fashion their works according to the popular taste. I trust,\r\nhowever, in subjects of this nature the florid style is most proper; and\r\nam so far from thinking that the vivid colouring I have used will be\r\nesteemed foreign and unnatural that I am most apprehensive that censure\r\nwill fall upon those parts where the diction is most simple and\r\nunornate. Nevertheless, I sincerely wish the time may come, and that it\r\nnow were, when the smooth and luscious, which has affected our style,\r\nshall give place, as it ought, to severe and chaste composition. -- Thus\r\nhave I given you an account of my doings of these last three days, that\r\nyour absence might not entirely deprive you of a pleasure which, from\r\nyour friendship to me, and the part you take in everything that concerns\r\nthe interest of literature, I know you would have received, had you been\r\nthere to hear. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI -- To CALVISIUS RUFUS\r\n\r\nI MUST have recourse to you, as usual, in an affair which concerns my\r\nfinances. An estate adjoining my land, and indeed running into it, is\r\nfor sale. There are several considerations strongly inclining me to this\r\npurchase, while there are others no less weighty deterring me from it.\r\nIts first recommendation is, the beauty which will result from uniting\r\nthis farm to my own lands; next, the advantage as well as pleasure of\r\nbeing able to visit it without additional trouble and expense; to have\r\nit superintended by the same steward, and almost by the same sub-agents,\r\nand to have one villa to support and embellish, the other just to keep\r\nin common repair. I take into this account furniture, housekeepers,\r\nfancy-gardeners, artificers, and even hunting-apparatus, as it makes a\r\nvery great difference whether you get these altogether into one place or\r\nscatter them about in several. On the other hand, I don't know whether\r\nit is prudent to expose so large a property to the same climate, and the\r\nsame risks of accident happening; to distribute one's possessions about\r\nseems a safer way of meeting the caprice of fortune, besides, there is\r\nsomething extremely pleasant in the change of air and place, and the\r\ngoing about between one's properties. And now, to come to the chief\r\nconsideration:--the lands are rich, fertile, and well-watered,\r\nconsisting chiefly of meadow-ground, vineyard, and wood, while the\r\nsupply of building timber and its returns, though moderate, still, keep\r\nat the same rate. But the soil, fertile as it is, has been much\r\nimpoverished by not having been properly looked after. The person last\r\nin possession used frequently to seize and sell the stock, by which\r\nmeans, although he lessened his tenants' arrears for the time being, yet\r\nhe left them nothing to go on with and the arrears ran up again in\r\nconsequence. I shall be obliged, then, to provide them with slaves,\r\nwhich I must buy, and at a higher than the usual price, as these will be\r\ngood ones; for I keep no fettered slaves[57] myself, and there are none\r\nupon the estate. For the rest, the price, you must know, is three\r\nmillions of sesterces.[58] It has formerly gone over five millions,[59]\r\nbut owing, partly to the general hardness of the times, and partly to\r\nits being thus stripped of tenants, the income of this estate is\r\nreduced, and consequently its value. You will be inclined perhaps to\r\nenquire whether I can easily raise the purchase-money? My estate, it is\r\ntrue, is almost entirely in land, though I have some money out at\r\ninterest; but I shall find no difficulty in borrowing any sum I may\r\nwant. I can get it from my wife's mother, whose purse I may use with the\r\nsame freedom as my own; so that you need not trouble yourself at all\r\nupon that point, should you have no other objections, which I should\r\nlike you very carefully to consider: for, as in everything else, so,\r\nparticularly in matters of economy, no man has more judgment and\r\nexperience than yourself. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII -- To CORNELIUS PRISCUS\r\n\r\nI HAVE just heard of Valerius Martial's death, which gives me great\r\nconcern. He was a man of an acute and lively genius, and his writings\r\nabound in equal wit, satire, and kindliness. On his leaving Rome I made\r\nhim a present to defray his travelling expenses, which I gave him, not\r\nonly as a testimony of friendship, but also in return for the verses\r\nwith which he had complimented me. It was the custom of the ancients to\r\ndistinguish those poets with honours or pecuniary rewards, who had\r\ncelebrated particular individuals or cities in their verses; but this\r\ngood custom, along with every other fair and noble one, has grown out of\r\nfashion now; and in consequence of our having ceased to act laudably, we\r\nconsider praise a folly and impertinence. You may perhaps be curious to\r\nsee the verses which merited this acknowledgment from me, and I believe\r\nI can, from memory, partly satisfy your curiosity, without referring you\r\nto his works: but if you should be pleased with this specimen of them,\r\nyou must turn to his poems for the rest. He addresses himself to his\r\nmuse, whom he directs to go to my house upon the Esquiline,[60] but to\r\napproach it with respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Go, wanton muse, but go with care, Nor meet, ill-tim'd, my Pliny's ear;\r\nHe, by sage Minerva taught, Gives the day to studious thought, And plans\r\nthat eloquence divine, Which shall to future ages shine, And rival,\r\nwondrous Tully! thine. Then, cautious, watch the vacant hour, When\r\nBacchus reigns in all his pow'r; When, crowned with rosy chaplets gay,\r\nCatos might read my frolic lay.\"<a href=\"#linknote-61\"\r\nname=\"linknoteref-61\" id=\"linknoteref-61\">[61]</a>\r\n\r\nDo you not think that the poet who wrote of me in such terms deserved\r\nsome friendly marks of my bounty then, and of my sorrow now? For he gave\r\nme the very best he had to bestow, and would have given more had it been\r\nin his power. Though indeed what can a man have conferred on him more\r\nvaluable than the honour of never-fading praise? But his poems will not\r\nlong survive their author, at least I think not, though he wrote them in\r\nthe expectation of their doing so. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII -- To FABATUS (HIS WIFE'S GRANDFATHER)\r\n\r\nYou have long desired a visit from your grand-daughter[62] accompanied\r\nby me. Nothing, be assured, could be more agreeable to either of us; for\r\nwe equally wish to see you, and are determined to delay that pleasure no\r\nlonger. For this purpose we are already packing up, and hastening to you\r\nwith all the speed the roads will permit of. We shall make only one,\r\nshort, stoppage, for we intend turning a little out of our way to go\r\ninto Tuscany: not for the sake of looking upon our estate, and into our\r\nfamily concerns, which we can postpone to another opportunity, but to\r\nperform an indispensable duty. There is a town near my estate, called\r\nTifernum-upon-the-Tiber,[63] which, with more affection than wisdom, put\r\nitself under my patronage when I was yet a youth. These people celebrate\r\nmy arrival among them, express the greatest concern when I leave them,\r\nand have public rejoicings whenever they hear of my preferments. By way\r\nof requiting their kindnesses (for what generous mind can bear to be\r\nexcelled in acts of friendship?) I have built a temple in this place, at\r\nmy own expense, and as it is finished, it would be a sort of impiety to\r\nput off its dedication any longer. So we shall be there on the day on\r\nwhich that ceremony is to be performed, and I have resolved to celebrate\r\nit with a general feast. We may possibly stay on there for all the next\r\nday, but shall make so much the greater haste in our journey afterwards.\r\nMay we have the happiness to find you and your daughter in good health!\r\nIn good spirits I am sure we shall, should we get to you all safely.\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX -- To ATTIUS CLEMENS\r\n\r\nREGULUS has lost his son; the only undeserved misfortune which could\r\nhave befallen him, in that I doubt whether he thinks it a misfortune.\r\nThe boy had quick parts, but there was no telling how he might turn out;\r\nhowever, he seemed capable enough of going right, were he not to grow up\r\nlike his father. Regulus gave him his freedom,[64] in order to entitle\r\nhim to the estate left him by his mother; and when he got into\r\npossession of it, (I speak of the current rumours, based upon the\r\ncharacter of the man,) fawned upon the lad with a disgusting shew of\r\nfond affection which in a parent was utterly out of place. You may\r\nhardly think this credible; but then consider what Regulus is. However,\r\nhe now expresses his concern for the loss of this youth in a most\r\nextravagant manner. The boy had a number of ponies for riding and\r\ndriving, dogs both big and little, together with nightingales, parrots,\r\nand blackbirds in abundance. All these Regulus slew round the funeral\r\npile. It was not grief, but an ostentatious parade of grief. He is\r\nvisited upon this occasion by a surprising number of people, who all\r\nhate and detest the man, and yet are as assiduous in their attendance\r\nupon him as if they really esteemed and loved him, and, to give you my\r\nopinion in a word, in endeavouring to do Regulus a kindness, make\r\nthemselves exactly like him. He keeps himself in his park on the other\r\nside the Tiber, where he has covered a vast extent of ground with his\r\nporticoes, and crowded all the shore with his statues; for he unites\r\nprodigality with excessive covetousness, and vain-glory with the height\r\nof infamy. At this very unhealthy time of year he is boring society, and\r\nhe feels pleasure and consolation in being a bore. He says he wishes to\r\nmarry,--a piece of perversity, like all his other conduct. You must\r\nexpect, therefore, to hear shortly of the marriage of this mourner, the\r\nmarriage of this old man; too early in the former case, in the latter,\r\ntoo late. You ask me why I conjecture this? Certainly not because he\r\nsays so himself (for a greater liar never stepped), but because there is\r\nno doubt that Regulus will do whatever ought not to be done. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL -- To CATIUS LEPIDUS\r\n\r\nI OFTEN tell you that there is a certain force of character about\r\nRegulus: it is wonderful how he carries through what he has set his mind\r\nto. He chose lately to be extremely concerned for the loss of his son:\r\naccordingly he mourned for him as never man mourned before. He took it\r\ninto his head to have an immense number of statues and pictures of him;\r\nimmediately all the artisans in Rome are set to work. Canvas, wax,\r\nbrass, silver, gold, ivory, marble, all exhibit the figure of the young\r\nRegulus. Not long ago he read, before a numerous audience, a memoir of\r\nhis son: a memoir of a mere boy! However he read it. He wrote likewise a\r\nsort of circular letter to the several Decurii desiring them to choose\r\nout one of their order who had a strong clear voice, to read this eulogy\r\nto the people; it has been actually done. Now had this force of\r\ncharacter or whatever else you may call a fixed determination in\r\nobtaining whatever one has a mind for, been rightly applied, what\r\ninfinite good it might have effected! The misfortune is, there is less\r\nof this quality about good people than about bad people, and as\r\nignorance begets rashness, and thoughtfulness produces deliberation, so\r\nmodesty is apt to cripple the action of virtue, whilst confidence\r\nstrengthens vice. Regulus is a case in point: he has a weak voice, an\r\nawkward delivery, an indistinct utterance, a slow imagination, and no\r\nmemory; in a word, he possesses nothing but a sort of frantic energy:\r\nand yet, by the assistance of a flighty turn and much impudence, he\r\npasses as an orator. Herennius Senecio admirably reversed Cato's\r\ndefinition of an orator, and applied it to Regulus: \"An orator,\" he\r\nsaid, \"is a bad man, unskilled in the art of speaking.\" And really\r\nCato's definition is not a more exact description of a true orator than\r\nSeneclo's is of the character of this man. Would you make me a suitable\r\nreturn for this letter? Let me know if you, or any of my friends in your\r\ntown, have, like a stroller in the marketplace, read this doleful\r\nproduction of Regulus's, \"raising,\" as Demosthenes says, \"your voice\r\nmost merrily, and straining every muscle in your throat.\" For so absurd\r\na performance must excite laughter rather than compassion; and indeed\r\nthe composition is as puerile as the subject. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI -- To MATURUS ARRIANUS\r\n\r\nMv advancement to the dignity of augur[65] is an honour that justly\r\nindeed merits your congratulations; not only because it is highly\r\nhonourable to receive, even in the slightest instances, a testimony of\r\nthe approbation of so wise and discreet a prince,[66] but because it is\r\nmoreover an ancient and religious institution, which has this sacred and\r\npeculiar privilege annexed to it, that it is for life. Other sacerdotal\r\noffices, though they may, perhaps, be almost equal to this one in\r\ndignity, yet as they are given so they may be taken away again: but\r\nfortune has no further power over this than to bestow it. What\r\nrecommends this dignity still more highly is, that I have the honour to\r\nsucceed so illustrious a person as Julius Frontinus. He for many years,\r\nupon the nomination-day of proper persons to be received into the sacred\r\ncollege, constantly proposed me, as though he had a view to electing me\r\nas his successor; and since it actually proved so in the event, I am\r\nwilling to look upon it as something more than mere accident. But the\r\ncircumstance, it seems, that most pleases you in this affair, is, that\r\nCicero enjoyed the same post; and you rejoice (you tell me) to find that\r\nI follow his steps as closely in the path of honours as I endeavour to\r\ndo in that of eloquence. I wish, indeed, that as I had the advantage of\r\nbeing admitted earlier into the same order of priesthood, and into the\r\nconsular office, than Cicero, that so I might, in my later years, catch\r\nsome spark, at least, of his divine genius! The former, indeed, being at\r\nman's disposal, may be conferred on me and on many others, but the\r\nlatter it is as presumptuous to hope for as it is difficult to reach,\r\nbeing in the gift of heaven alone. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII -- To STATIUS SABINUS\r\n\r\nYOUR letter informs me that Sabina, who appointed you and me her heirs,\r\nthough she has nowhere expressly directed that Modestus shall have his\r\nfreedom, yet has left him a legacy in the following words, \"I give, &c.-\r\n-To Modestus, whom I have ordered to have his freedom\": upon which you\r\ndesire my opinion. I have consulted skilful lawyers upon the point, and\r\nthey all agree Modestus is not entitled to his liberty, since it is not\r\nexpressly given, and consequently that the legacy is void, as being\r\nbequeathed to a slave.[67] But it evidently appears to be a mistake in\r\nthe testatrix; and therefore I think we ought to act in this case as\r\nthough Sabina had directed, in so many words, what, it is clear, she had\r\nordered. I am persuaded you will go with me in this opinion, who so\r\nreligiously regard the will of the deceased, which indeed where it can\r\nbe discovered will always be law to honest heirs. Honour is to you and\r\nme as strong an obligation as the compulsion of law is to others. Let\r\nModestus then enjoy his freedom and his legacy as fully as if Sabina had\r\nobserved all the requisite forms, as indeed they effectually do who make\r\na judicious choice of their heirs. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII -- To CORNELIUS MINICIANUS\r\n\r\n[68] Have you heard--I suppose, not yet, for the news has but just\r\narrived -- that Valerius Licinianus has become a professor in Sicily?\r\nThis unfortunate person, who lately enjoyed the dignity of praetor, and\r\nwas esteemed the most eloquent of our advocates, is now fallen from a\r\nsenator to an exile, from an orator to a teacher of rhetoric.\r\nAccordingly in his inaugural speech he uttered, sorrowfully and\r\nsolemnly, the following words: \"Oh! Fortune, how capriciously dost thou\r\nsport with mankind! Thou makest rhetoricians of senators, and senators\r\nof rhetoricians!\" A sarcasm so poignant and full of gall that one might\r\nalmost imagine he fixed upon this profession merely for the sake of an\r\nopportunity of applying it. And having made his first appearance in\r\nschool, clad in the Greek cloak (for exiles have no right to wear the\r\ntoga), after arranging himself and looking down upon his attire, \"I am,\r\nhowever,\" he said, \"going to declaim in Latin.\" You will think, perhaps,\r\nthis situation, wretched and deplorable as it is, is what he well\r\ndeserves for having stained the honourable profession of an orator with\r\nthe crime of incest. It is true, indeed, he pleaded guilty to the\r\ncharge; but whether from a consciousness of his guilt, or from an\r\napprehension of worse consequences if he denied it, is not clear; for\r\nDomitian generally raged most furiously where his evidence failed him\r\nmost hopelessly. That emperor had determined that Cornelia, chief of the\r\nVestal Virgins, should be buried alive, from an extravagant notion that\r\nexemplary severities of this kind conferred lustre upon his reign.\r\nAccordingly, by virtue of his office as supreme pontiff, or, rather, in\r\nthe exercise of a tyrant's cruelty, a despot's lawlessness, he convened\r\nthe sacred college, not in the pontifical court where they usually\r\nassemble, but at his villa near Alba; and there, with a guilt no less\r\nheinous than that which he professed to be punishing, he condemned her,\r\nwhen she was not present to defend herself, on the charge of incest,\r\nwhile he himself had been guilty, not only of debauching his own\r\nbrother's daughter, but was also accessory to her death: for that lady,\r\nbeing a widow, in order to conceal her shame, endeavoured to procure an\r\nabortion, and by that means lost her life. However, the priests were\r\ndirected to see the sentence immediately executed upon Cornelia. As they\r\nwere leading her to the place of execution, she called upon Vesta, and\r\nthe rest of the gods, to attest her innocence; and, amongst other\r\nexclamations, frequently cried out, \"Is it possible that Cæsar can think\r\nme polluted, under the influence of whose sacred functions he has\r\nconquered and triumphed?\"[69] Whether she said this in flattery or\r\nderision; whether it proceeded from a consciousness of her innocence, or\r\ncontempt of the emperor, is uncertain; but she continued exclaiming in\r\nthis manner, till she came to the place of execution, to which she was\r\nled, whether innocent or guilty I cannot say, at all events with every\r\nappearance and demonstration of innocence. As she was being lowered down\r\ninto the subterranean vault, her robe happening to catch upon something\r\nin the descent, she turned round and disengaged it, when, the\r\nexecutioner offering his assistance, she drew herself back with horror,\r\nrefusing to be so much as touched by him, as though it were a defilement\r\nto her pure and unspotted chastity: still preserving the appearance of\r\nsanctity up to the last moment; and, among all the other instances of\r\nher modesty,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"She took great care to fall with decency.\"<a href=\"#linknote-70\"\r\nname=\"linknoteref-70\" id=\"linknoteref-70\">[70]</a>\r\n\r\nCeler likewise, a Roman knight, who was accused of an intrigue with her,\r\nwhile they were scourging him with rods[71] in the Forum, persisted in\r\nexclaiming, \"What have I done?--I have done nothing.\" These declarations\r\nof innocence had exasperated Domitian exceedingly, as imputing to him\r\nacts of cruelty and injustice, accordingly Licinianus being seized by\r\nthe emperor's orders for having concealed a freedwoman of Cornelia's in\r\none of his estates, was advised, by those who took him in charge, to\r\nconfess the fact, if he hoped to obtain a remission of his punishment,\r\ncircumstance to add further, that a young nobleman, having had his tunic\r\ntorn, an ordinary occurrence in a crowd, stood with his gown thrown over\r\nhim, to hear me, and that during the seven hours I was speaking, whilst\r\nmy success more than counterbalanced the fatigue of so long a speech. So\r\nlet us set to and not screen our own indolence under pretence of that of\r\nthe public. Never, be very sure of that, will there be wanting hearers\r\nand readers, so long as we can only supply them with speakers and\r\nwriters worth their attention. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV -- To ASINIUS\r\n\r\nYou advise me, nay you entreat me, to undertake, in her absence, the\r\ncause of Corellia, against C. Caecilius, consul elect. For your advice I\r\nam grateful, of your entreaty I really must complain; without the first,\r\nindeed, I should have been ignorant of this affair, but the last was\r\nunnecessary, as I need no solicitations to comply, where it would be\r\nungenerous in me to refuse; for can I hesitate a moment to take upon\r\nmyself the protection of a daughter of Corellius? It is true, indeed,\r\nthough there is no particular intimacy between her adversary and myself,\r\nstill we are upon good enough terms. It is also true that he is a person\r\nof rank, and one who has a high claim upon my especial regard, as\r\ndestined to enter upon an office which I have had the honour to fill;\r\nand it is natural for a man to be desirous those dignities should be\r\nheld in the highest esteem which he himself once possessed. Yet all\r\nthese considerations appear indifferent and trifling when I reflect that\r\nit is the daughter of Corellius whom I am to defend. The memory of that\r\nexcellent person, than whom this age has not produced a man of greater\r\ndignity, rectitude, and acuteness, is indelibly imprinted upon my mind.\r\nMy regard for him sprang from my admiration of the man, and contrary to\r\nwhat is usually the case, my admiration increased upon a thorough\r\nknowledge of him, and indeed I did know him thoroughly, for he kept\r\nnothing back from me, whether gay or serious, sad or joyous. When he was\r\nbut a youth, he esteemed, and (I will even venture to say) revered, me\r\nas if I had been his equal. When I solicited any post of honour, he\r\nsupported me with his interest, and recommended me with his testimony;\r\nwhen I entered upon it, he was my introducer and my companion; when I\r\nexercised it, he was my guide and my counsellor. In a word, whenever my\r\ninterest was concerned, he exerted himself, in spite of his weakness and\r\ndeclining years, with as much alacrity as though he were still young and\r\nlusty. In private, in public, and at court, how often has he advanced\r\nand supported my credit and interest! It happened once that the\r\nconversation, in the presence of the emperor Nerva, turned upon the\r\npromising young men of that time, and several of the company present\r\nwere pleased to mention me with applause; he sat for a little while\r\nsilent, which gave what he said the greater weight; and then, with that\r\nair of dignity, to which you are no stranger, \"I must be reserved,\" said\r\nhe, \"in my praises of Pliny, because he does nothing without advice.\" By\r\nwhich single sentence he bestowed upon me more than my most extravagant\r\nwishes could aspire to, as he represented my conduct to be always such\r\nas wisdom must approve, since it was wholly under the direction of one\r\nof the wisest of men. Even in his last moments he said to his daughter\r\n(as she often mentions), \"I have in the course of a long life raised up\r\nmany friends to you, but there are none in whom you may more assuredly\r\nconfide than Pliny and Cornutus.\" A circumstance I cannot reflect upon\r\nwithout being deeply sensible how incumbent it is upon me to endeavour\r\nnot to disappoint the confidence so excellent a judge of human nature\r\nreposed in me. I shall therefore most readily give my assistance to\r\nCorellia in this affair, and willingly risk any displeasure I may incur\r\nby appearing in her behalf. Though I should imagine, if in the course of\r\nmy pleadings I should find an opportunity to explain and enforce more\r\nfully and at large than the limits of a letter allow of the reasons I\r\nhave here mentioned, upon which I rest at once my apology and my glory;\r\nher adversary (whose suit may perhaps, as you say, be entirely without\r\nprecedent, as it is against a woman) will not only excuse, but approve,\r\nmy conduct. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVI -- To HISPULLA\r\n\r\nAs you are a model of all virtue, and loved your late excellent brother,\r\nwho had such a fondness for you, with an affection equal to his own;\r\nregarding too his daughter[72] as your child, not only shewing her an\r\naunt's tenderness but supplying the place of the parent she had lost; I\r\nknow it will give you the greatest pleasure and joy to hear that she\r\nproves worthy of her father, her grandfather, and yourself. She\r\npossesses an excellent understanding together with a consummate\r\nprudence, and gives the strongest evidence of the purity of her heart by\r\nher fondness of her husband. Her affection for me, moreover, has given\r\nher a taste for books, and my productions, which she takes a pleasure in\r\nreading, and even in getting by heart, are continually in her hands. How\r\nfull of tender anxiety is she when I am going to speak in any case, how\r\nrejoiced she feels when it is got through. While I am pleading, she\r\nstations persons to inform her from time to time how I am heard, what\r\napplauses I receive, and what success attends the case. When I recite my\r\nworks at any time, she conceals herself behind some curtain, and drinks\r\nin my praises with greedy ears. She sings my verses too, adapting them\r\nto her lyre, with no other master but love, that best of instructors,\r\nfor her guide. From these happy circumstances I derive my surest hopes,\r\nthat the harmony between us will increase with our days, and be as\r\nlasting as our lives. For it is not my youth or person, which time\r\ngradually impairs; it is my honour and glory that she cares for. But\r\nwhat less could be expected from one who was trained by your hands, and\r\nformed by your instructions; who was early familiarized under your roof\r\nwith all that is pure and virtuous, and who learnt to love me first\r\nthrough your praises? And as you revered my mother with all the respect\r\ndue even to a parent, so you kindly directed and encouraged my tender\r\nyears, presaging from that early period all that my wife now fondly\r\nimagines I really am. Accept therefore of our mutual thanks, mine, for\r\nyour giving me her, hers for your giving her me; for you have chosen us\r\nout, as it were, for each other. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII -- To ROMATIUS FIASIUS\r\n\r\nLook here! The next time the court sits, you must, at all events, take\r\nyour place there. In vain would your indolence repose itself under my\r\nprotection, for there is no absenting oneself with impunity. Look at\r\nthat severe, determined, praetor, Licinius Nepos, who fined even a\r\nsenator for the same neglect! The senator pleaded his cause in person,\r\nbut in suppliant tone. The fine, it is true, was remitted, but sore was\r\nhis dismay, humble his intercession, and he had to ask pardon. \"All\r\npraetors are not so severe as that,\" you will reply; you are mistaken --\r\nfor though indeed to be the author and reviver of an example of this\r\nkind may be an act of severity, yet, once introduced, even lenity\r\nherself may follow the precedent. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII -- To LICINIUS SURA\r\n\r\nI HAVE brought you as a little present out of the country a query which\r\nwell deserves the consideration of your extensive knowledge. There is a\r\nspring which rises in a neighbouring mountain, and running among the\r\nrocks is received into a little banqueting-room, artificially formed for\r\nthat purpose, from whence, after being detained a short time, it falls\r\ninto the Larian lake. The nature of this spring is extremely curious; it\r\nebbs and flows regularly three times a day. The increase and decrease is\r\nplainly visible, and exceedingly interesting to observe. You sit down by\r\nthe side of the fountain, and while you are taking a repast and drinking\r\nits water, which is extremely cool, you see it gradually rise and fall.\r\nIf you place a ring, or anything else at the bottom, when it is dry, the\r\nwater creeps gradually up, first gently washing, finally covering it\r\nentirely, and then little by little subsides again. If you wait long\r\nenough, you may see it thus alternately advance and recede three\r\nsuccessive times. Shall we say that some secret current of air stops and\r\nopens the fountain-head, first rushing in and checking the flow and\r\nthen, driven back by the counter-resistance of the water, escaping\r\nagain; as we see in bottles, and other vessels of that nature, where,\r\nthere not being a free and open passage, though you turn their necks\r\nperpendicularly or obliquely downwards, yet, the outward air obstructing\r\nthe vent, they discharge their contents as it were by starts? Or, may\r\nnot this small collection of water be successively contracted and\r\nenlarged upon the same principle as the ebb and flow of the sea? Or,\r\nagain, as those rivers which discharge themselves into the sea, meeting\r\nwith contrary winds and the swell of the ocean, are forced back in their\r\nchannels, so, in the same way, may there not be something that checks\r\nthis fountain, for a time, in its progress? Or is there rather a certain\r\nreservoir that contains these waters in the bowels of the earth, and\r\nwhile it is recruiting its discharges, the stream in consequence flows\r\nmore slowly and in less quantity, but, when it has collected its due\r\nmeasure, runs on again in its usual strength and fulness? Or lastly, is\r\nthere I know not what kind of subterranean counterpoise, that throws up\r\nthe water when the fountain is dry, and keeps it back when it is full?\r\nYou, who are so well qualified for the enquiry, will examine into the\r\ncauses of this wonderful phenomenon; it will be sufficient for me if I\r\nhave given you an adequate description of it. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIX -- To ANNIUS SEVERUS\r\n\r\nA SMALL legacy was lately left me, yet one more acceptable than a far\r\nlarger bequest would have been. How more acceptable than a far larger\r\none? In this way. Pomponia Gratilla, having disinherited her son\r\nAssidius Curianus, appointed me of one of her heirs, and Sertorius\r\nSeverus, of pretorian rank, together with several eminent Roman knights,\r\nco-heirs along with me. The son applied to me to give him my share of\r\nthe inheritance, in order to use my name as an example to the rest of\r\nthe joint-heirs, but offered at the same time to enter into a secret\r\nagreement to return me my proportion. I told him, it was by no means\r\nagreeable to my character to seem to act one way while in reality I was\r\nacting another, besides it was not quite honourable making presents to a\r\nman of his fortune, who had no children; in a word, this would not at\r\nall answer the purpose at which he was aiming, whereas, if I were to\r\nwithdraw my claim, it might be of some service to him, and this I was\r\nready and willing to do, if he could clearly prove to me that he was\r\nunjustly disinherited.\r\n\r\n\"Do then,\" he said, \"be my arbitrator in this case.\" After a short pause\r\nI answered him, \"I will, for I don't see why I should not have as good\r\nan opinion of my own impartial disinterestedness as you seem to have.\r\nBut, mind, I am not to be prevailed upon to decide the point in question\r\nagainst your mother, if it should appear she had just reason for what\r\nshe has done.\" \"As you please,\" he replied, \"which I am sure is always\r\nto act according to justice.\" I called in, as my assistants, Corellius\r\nand Frontinus, two of the very best lawyers Rome at that time afforded.\r\nWith these in attendance, I heard the case in my own chamber. Curianus\r\nsaid everything which he thought would favour his pretensions, to whom\r\n(there being nobody but myself to defend the character of the deceased)\r\nI made a short reply; after which I retired with my friends to\r\ndeliberate, and, being agreed upon our verdict, I said to him,\r\n\"Curianus, it is our opinion that your conduct has justly drawn upon you\r\nyour mother's displeasure.\" Sometime afterwards, Curianus commenced a\r\nsuit in the Court of the Hundred against all the co-heirs except myself.\r\nThe day appointed for the trial approaching, the rest of the co-heirs\r\nwere anxious to compromise the affair and have done with it, not out of\r\nany diffidence of their cause, but from a distrust of the times. They\r\nwere apprehensive of what had happened to many others, happening to\r\nthem, and that from a civil suit it might end in a criminal one, as\r\nthere were some among them to whom the friendship of Gratilla and\r\nRusticus[73] might be extremely prejudicial: they therefore desired me\r\nto go and talk with Curianus. We met in the temple of Concord; \"Now\r\nsupposing,\" I said, \"your mother had left you the fourth part of her\r\nestate, or even suppose she had made you sole heir, but had exhausted so\r\nmuch of the estate in legacies that there would not be more than a\r\nfourth part remaining to you, could you justly complain? You ought to be\r\ncontent, therefore, if, being absolutely disinherited as you are, the\r\nheirs are willing to relinquish to you a fourth part, which however I\r\nwill increase by contributing my proportion. You know you did not\r\ncommence any suit against me, and two years have now elapsed, which\r\ngives me legal and indisputable possession. But to induce you to agree\r\nto the proposals on the part of the other co-heirs, and that you may be\r\nno sufferer by the peculiar respect you shew me, I offer to advance my\r\nproportion with them.\" The silent approval of my own conscience is not\r\nthe only result out of this transaction; it has contributed also to the\r\nhonour of my character. For it is this same Cunianus who has left me the\r\nlegacy I have mentioned in the beginning of my letter, and I received it\r\nas a very notable mark of his approbation of my conduct, if I do not\r\nflatter myself. I have written and told you all this, because in all my\r\njoys and sorrows I am wont to look upon you as myself, and I thought it\r\nwould be unkind not to communicate to so tender a friend whatever\r\noccasions me a sensible gratification; for I am not philosopher enough\r\nto be indifferent, when I think I have acted like an honour-able man,\r\nwhether my actions meet with that approval which is in some sort their\r\ndue. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL -- To TITIUS ARISTO\r\n\r\nAMONG the many agreeable and obliging instances I have received of your\r\nfriendship, your not concealing from me the long conversations which\r\nlately took place at your house concerning my verses, and the various\r\njudgments passed upon them (which served to prolong the talk,) is by no\r\nmeans the least. There were some, it seems, who did not disapprove of my\r\npoems in themselves, but at the same time censured me in a free and\r\nfriendly way, for employing myself in composing and reciting them. I am\r\nso far, however, from desiring to extenuate the charge that I willingly\r\nacknowledge myself still more deserving of it, and confess that I\r\nsometimes amuse myself with writing verses of the gayer sort. I compose\r\ncomedies, divert myself with pantomimes, read the lyric poets, and enter\r\ninto the spirit of the most wanton muse, besides that, I indulge myself\r\nsometimes in laughter, mirth, and frolic, and, to sum up every kind of\r\ninnocent relaxation in one word, I am a man. I am not in the least\r\noffended, though, at their low opinion of my morals, and that those who\r\nare ignorant of the fact that the most learned, the wisest, and the best\r\nof men have employed themselves in the same way, should be surprised at\r\nthe tone of my writings: but from those who know what noble and numerous\r\nexamples I follow, I shall, I am confident, easily obtain permission to\r\nerr with those whom it is an honour to imitate, not only in their most\r\nserious occupations but their lightest triflings. Is it unbecoming me (I\r\nwill not name any living example, lest I should seem to flatter), but is\r\nit unbecoming me to practise what became Tully, Calvus, Pollio, Messala,\r\nHortensius, Brutus, Sulla, Catulus, Scaevola, Sulpitius, Varro, the\r\nTorquati, Memmius, Gaetulicus, Seneca, Lucceius, and, within our own\r\nmemory, Verginius Rufus? But if the examples of private men are not\r\nsufficient to justify me, I can cite Julius Casar, Augustus, Nerva, and\r\nTiberius Casar. I forbear to add Nero to the catalogue, though I am\r\naware that what is practised by the worst of men does not therefore\r\ndegenerate into wrong: on the contrary, it still maintains its credit,\r\nif frequently countenanced by the best. In that number, Virgil,\r\nCornelius Nepos, and prior to these, Ennius and Attius, justly deserve\r\nthe most distinguished place. These last indeed were not senators, but\r\ngoodness knows no distinction of rank or title. I recite my works, it is\r\ntrue, and in this instance I am not sure I can support myself by their\r\nexamples. They, perhaps, might be satisfied with their own judgment, but\r\nI have too humble an opinion of mine to suppose my compositions perfect,\r\nbecause they appear so to my own mind. My reason then for reciting are,\r\nthat, for one thing, there is a certain deference for one's audience,\r\nwhich excites a somewhat more vigorous application, and then again, I\r\nhave by this means an opportunity of settling any doubts I may have\r\nconcerning my performance, by observing the general opinion of the\r\naudience. In a word, I have the advantage of receiving different hints\r\nfrom different persons: and although they should not declare their\r\nmeaning in express terms, yet the expression of the countenance, the\r\nmovement of the head, the eyes, the motion of a hand, a whisper, or even\r\nsilence itself will easily distinguish their real opinion from the\r\nlanguage of politeness. And so if any one of my audience should have the\r\ncuriosity to read over the same performance which he heard me read, he\r\nmay find several things altered or omitted, and perhaps too upon his\r\nparticular judgment, though he did not say a single word to me. But I am\r\nnot defending my conduct in this particular, as if I had actually\r\nrecited my works in public, and not in my own house before my friends, a\r\nnumerous appearance of whom has upon many occasions been held an honour,\r\nbut never, surely, a reproach. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLI -- To NONIUS MAXIMUS\r\n\r\nI AM deeply afflicted with the news I have received of the death of\r\nFannius; in the first place, because I loved one so eloquent and\r\nrefined, in the next, because I was accustomed to be guided by his\r\njudgment--and indeed he possessed great natural acuteness, improved by\r\npractice, rendering him able to see a thing in an instant. There are\r\nsome circumstances about his death, which aggravate my concern. He left\r\nbehind him a will which had been made a considerable time before his\r\ndecease, by which it happens that his estate is fallen into the hands of\r\nthose who had incurred his displeasure, whilst his greatest favourites\r\nare excluded. But what I particularly regret is, that he has left\r\nunfinished a very noble work in which he was employed. Notwithstanding\r\nhis full practice at the bar, he had begun a history of those persons\r\nwho were put to death or banished by Nero, and completed three books of\r\nit. They are written with great elegance and precision, the style is\r\npure, and preserves a proper medium between the plain narrative and the\r\nhistorical: and as they were very favourably received by the public, he\r\nwas the more desirous of being able to finish the rest. The hand of\r\ndeath is ever, in my opinion, too untimely and sudden when it falls upon\r\nsuch as are employed in some immortal work. The sons of sensuality, who\r\nhave no outlook beyond the present hour, put an end every day to all\r\nmotives for living, but those who look forward to posterity, and\r\nendeavour to transmit their names with honour to future generations by\r\ntheir works--to such, death is always immature, as it still snatches\r\nthem from amidst some unfinished design. Fannius, long before his death,\r\nhad a presentiment of what has happened: he dreamed one night that as he\r\nwas lying on his couch, in an undress, all ready for his work, and with\r\nhis desk,[74] as usual, in front of him, Nero entered, and placing\r\nhimself by his side, took up the three first books of this history,\r\nwhich he read through and then departed. This dream greatly alarmed him,\r\nand he regarded it as an intimation, that he should not carry on his\r\nhistory any farther than Nero had read, and so the event has proved. I\r\ncannot reflect upon this accident without lamenting that he was\r\nprevented from accomplishing a work which had cost him so many toilsome\r\nvigils, as it suggests to me, at the same time, reflections on my own\r\nmortality, and the fate of my writings: and I am persuaded the same\r\napprehensions alarm you for those in which you are at present employed.\r\nLet us then, my friend, while life permits, exert all our endeavours,\r\nthat death, whenever it arrives, may find as little as possible to\r\ndestroy. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLII -- To DOMITIUS APOLLINARIS\r\n\r\nTHE kind concern you expressed on hearing of my design to pass the\r\nsummer at my villa in Tuscany, and your obliging endeavours to dissuade\r\nme from going to a place which you think unhealthy, are extremely\r\npleasing to me. It is quite true indeed that the air of that part of\r\nTuscany which lies towards the coast is thick and unwholesome: but my\r\nhouse stands at a good distance from the sea, under one of the Apennines\r\nwhich are singularly healthy. But, to relieve you from all anxiety on my\r\naccount, I will give you a description of the temperature of the\r\nclimate, the situation of the country, and the beauty of my villa,\r\nwhich, I am persuaded, you will hear with as much pleasure as I shall\r\ntake in giving it. The air in winter is sharp and frosty, so that\r\nmyrtles, olives, and trees of that kind which delight in constant\r\nwarmth, will not flourish here: but the laurel thrives, and is\r\nremarkably beautiful, though now and then the cold kills it--though not\r\noftener than it does in the neighbourhood of Rome. The summers are\r\nextraordinarily mild, and there is always a refreshing breeze, seldom\r\nhigh winds. This accounts for the number of old men we have about, you\r\nwould see grandfathers and great-grandfathers of those now grown up to\r\nbe young men, hear old stories and the dialect of our ancestors, and\r\nfancy yourself born in some former age were you to come here. The\r\ncharacter of the country is exceedingly beautiful. Picture to yourself\r\nan immense amphitheatre, such as nature only could create. Before you\r\nlies a broad, extended plain bounded by a range of mountains, whose\r\nsummits are covered with tall and ancient woods, which are stocked with\r\nall kinds of game.\r\n\r\nThe descending slopes of the mountains are planted with underwood, among\r\nwhich are a number of little risings with a rich soil, on which hardly a\r\nstone is to be found. In fruitfulness they are quite equal to a valley,\r\nand though their harvest is rather later, their crops are just as good.\r\nAt the foot of these, on the mountain-side, the eye, wherever it turns,\r\nruns along one unbroken stretch of vineyards terminated by a belt of\r\nshrubs. Next you have meadows and the open plain. The arable land is so\r\nstiff that it is necessary to go over it nine times with the biggest\r\noxen and the strongest ploughs. The meadows are bright with flowers, and\r\nproduce trefoil and other kinds of herbage as fine and tender as if it\r\nwere but just sprung up, for all the soil is refreshed by never failing\r\nstreams. But though there is plenty of water, there are no marshes; for\r\nthe ground being on a slope, whatever water it receives without\r\nabsorbing runs off into the Tiber. This river, which winds through the\r\nmiddle of the meadows, is navigable only in the winter and spring, at\r\nwhich seasons it transports the produce of the lands to Rome: but in\r\nsummer it sinks below its banks, leaving the name of a great river to an\r\nalmost empty channel: towards the autumn, however, it begins again to\r\nrenew its claim to that title. You would be charmed by taking a view of\r\nthis country from the top of one of our neighbouring mountains, and\r\nwould fancy that not a real, but some imaginary landscape, painted by\r\nthe most exquisite pencil, lay before you, such an harmonious variety of\r\nbeautiful objects meets the eye, whichever way it turns. My house,\r\nalthough at the foot of a hill, commands as good a view as if it stood\r\non its brow, yet you approach by so gentle and gradual a rise that you\r\nfind yourself on high ground without perceiving you have been making an\r\nascent. Behind, but at a great distance, is the Apennine range. In the\r\ncalmest days we get cool breezes from that quarter, not sharp and\r\ncutting at all, being spent and broken by the long distance they have\r\ntravelled. The greater part of the house has a southern aspect, and\r\nseems to invite the afternoon sun in summer (but rather earlier in the\r\nwinter) into a broad and proportionately long portico, consisting of\r\nseveral rooms, particularly a court of antique fashion. In front of the\r\nportico is a sort of terrace, edged with box and shrubs cut into\r\ndifferent shapes. You descend, from the terrace, by an easy slope\r\nadorned with the figures of animals in box, facing each other, to a lawn\r\noverspread with the soft, I had almost said the liquid, Acanthus: this\r\nis surrounded by a walk enclosed with evergreens, shaped into a variety\r\nof forms. Beyond it is the gestation laid out in the form of a circus\r\nrunning round the multiform box-hedge and the dwarf-trees, which are cut\r\nquite close. The whole is fenced in with a wall completely covered by\r\nbox cut into steps all the way up to the top. On the outside of the wall\r\nlies a meadow that owes as many beauties to nature as all I have been\r\ndescribing within does to art; at the end of which are open plain and\r\nnumerous other meadows and copses. From the extremity of the portico a\r\nlarge dining-room runs out, opening upon one end of the terrace, while\r\nfrom the windows there is a very extensive view over the meadows up into\r\nthe country, and from these you also see the terrace and the projecting\r\nwing of the house together with the woods enclosing the adjacent\r\nhippodrome. Almost opposite the centre of the portico, and rather to the\r\nback, stands a summer-house, enclosing a small area shaded by four\r\nplane-trees, in the midst of which rises a marble fountain which gently\r\nplays upon the roots of the plane-trees and upon the grass-plots\r\nunderneath them. This summer-house has a bed-room in it free from every\r\nsort of noise, and which the light itself cannot penetrate, together\r\nwith a common dining-room I use when I have none but intimate friends\r\nwith me. A second portico looks upon this little area, and has the same\r\nview as the other I have just been describing. There is, besides,\r\nanother room, which, being situate close to the nearest plane-tree,\r\nenjoys a constant shade and green. Its sides are encrusted with carved\r\nmarble up to the ceiling, while above the marble a foliage is painted\r\nwith birds among the branches, which has an effect altogether as\r\nagreeable as that of the carving, at the foot of which a little\r\nfountain, playing through several small pipes into a vase it encloses,\r\nproduces a most pleasing murmur. From a corner of the portico you enter\r\na very large bed-chamber opposite the large dining-room, which from some\r\nof its windows has a view of the terrace, and from others, of the\r\nmeadow, as those in the front look upon a cascade, which entertains at\r\nonce both the eye and the ear; for the water, dashing from a great\r\nheight, foams over the marble basin which receives it below. This room\r\nis extremely warm in winter, lying much exposed to the sun, and on a\r\ncloudy day the heat of an adjoining stove very well supplies his\r\nabsence. Leaving this room, you pass through a good-sized, pleasant,\r\nundressing-room into the cold-bath-room, in which is a large gloomy\r\nbath: but if you are inclined to swim more at large, or in warmer water,\r\nin the middle of the area stands a wide basin for that purpose, and near\r\nit a reservoir from which you may be supplied with cold water to brace\r\nyourself again, if you should find you are too much relaxed by the warm.\r\nAdjoining the cold bath is one of a medium degree of heat, which enjoys\r\nthe kindly warmth of the sun, but not so intensely as the hot bath,\r\nwhich projects farther. This last consists of three several\r\ncompartments, each of different degrees of heat; the two former lie open\r\nto the full sun, the latter, though not much exposed to its heat,\r\nreceives an equal share of its light. Over the undressing-room is built\r\nthe tennis-court, which admits of different kinds of games and different\r\nsets of players. Not far from the baths is the staircase leading to the\r\nenclosed portico, three rooms intervening. One of these looks out upon\r\nthe little area with the four plane-trees round it, the other upon the\r\nmeadows, and from the third you have a view of several vineyards, so\r\nthat each has a different one, and looks towards a different point of\r\nthe heavens. At the upper end of the enclosed portico, and indeed taken\r\noff from it, is a room that looks out upon the hippodrome, the\r\nvineyards, and the mountains; adjoining is a room which has a full\r\nexposure to the sun, especially in winter, and out of which runs another\r\nconnecting the hippodrome with the house. This forms the front. On the\r\nside rises an enclosed portico, which not only looks out upon the\r\nvineyards, but seems almost to touch them. From the middle of this\r\nportico you enter a dining-room cooled by the wholesome breezes from the\r\nApennine valleys: from the windows behind, which are extremely large,\r\nthere is a close view of the vineyards, and from the folding doors\r\nthrough the summer portico. Along that side of the dining-room where\r\nthere are no windows runs a private staircase for greater convenience in\r\nserving up when I give an entertainment; at the farther end is a\r\nsleeping-room with a look-out upon the vineyards, and (what is equally\r\nagreeable) the portico. Underneath this room is an enclosed portico\r\nresembling a grotto, which, enjoying in the midst of summer heats its\r\nown natural coolness, neither admits nor wants external air. After you\r\nhave passed both these porticoes, at the end of the dining-room stands a\r\nthird, which according as the day is more or less advanced, serves\r\neither for Winter or summer use. It leads to two different apartments,\r\none containing four chambers, the other, three, which enjoy by turns\r\nboth sun and shade. This arrangement of the different parts of my house\r\nis exceedingly pleasant, though it is not to be compared with the beauty\r\nof the hippodrome,' lying entirely open in the middle of the grounds, so\r\nthat the eye, upon your first entrance, takes it in entire in one view.\r\nIt is set round with plane-trees covered with ivy, so that, while their\r\ntops flourish with their own green, towards the roots their verdure is\r\nborrowed from the ivy that twines round the trunk and branches, spreads\r\nfrom tree to tree, and connects them together. Between each plane-tree\r\nare planted box-trees, and behind these stands a grove of laurels which\r\nblend their shade with that of the planes. This straight boundary to the\r\nhippodrome[75] alters its shape at the farther end, bending into a\r\nsemicircle, which is planted round, shut in with cypresses, and casts a\r\ndeeper and gloomier shade, while the inner circular walks (for there are\r\nseveral), enjoying an open exposure, are filled with plenty of roses,\r\nand correct, by a very pleasant contrast, the coolness of the shade with\r\nthe warmth of the sun. Having passed through these several winding\r\nalleys, you enter a straight walk, which breaks out into a variety of\r\nothers, partitioned off by box-row hedges. In one place you have a\r\nlittle meadow, in another the box is cut in a thousand different forms,\r\nsometimes into letters, expressing the master's name, sometimes the\r\nartificer's, whilst here and there rise little obelisks with fruit-trees\r\nalternately intermixed, and then on a sudden, in the midst of this\r\nelegant regularity, you are surprised with an imitation of the negligent\r\nbeauties of rural nature. In the centre of this lies a spot adorned with\r\na knot of dwarf plane-trees. Beyond these stands an acacia, smooth and\r\nbending in places, then again various other shapes and names. At the\r\nupper end is an alcove of white marble, shaded with vines and supported\r\nby four small Carystian columns. From this semicircular couch, the\r\nwater, gushing up through several little pipes, as though pressed out by\r\nthe weight of the persons who recline themselves upon it, falls into a\r\nstone cistern underneath, from whence it is received into a fine\r\npolished marble basin, so skilfully contrived that it is always full\r\nwithout ever overflowing. When I sup here, this basin serves as a table,\r\nthe larger sort of dishes being placed round the margin, while the\r\nsmaller ones swim about in the form of vessels and water-fowl. Opposite\r\nthis is a fountain which is incessantly emptying and filling, for the\r\nwater which it throws up to a great height, falling back again into it,\r\nis by means of consecutive apertures returned as fast as it is received.\r\nFacing the alcove (and reflecting upon it as great an ornament as it\r\nborrows from it) stands a summer-house of exquisite marble, the doors of\r\nwhich project and open into a green enclosure, while from its upper and\r\nlower windows the eye falls upon a variety of different greens. Next to\r\nthis is a little private closet (which, though it seems distinct, may\r\nform part of the same room), furnished with a couch, and notwithstanding\r\nit has windows on every side, yet it enjoys a very agreeable gloom, by\r\nmeans of a spreading vine which climbs to the top, and entirely\r\novershadows it. Here you may lie and fancy yourself in a wood, with this\r\nonly difference, that you are not exposed to the weather as you would be\r\nthere. Here too a fountain rises and instantly disappears--several\r\nmarble seats are set in different places, which are as pleasant as the\r\nsummer-house itself after one is tired out with walking. Near each is a\r\nlittle fountain, and throughout the whole hippodrome several small rills\r\nrun murmuring along through pipes, wherever the hand of art has thought\r\nproper to conduct them, watering here and there different plots of\r\ngreen, and sometimes all parts at once. I should have ended before now,\r\nfor fear of being too chatty, had I not proposed in this letter to lead\r\nyou into every corner of my house and gardens. Nor did I apprehend your\r\nthinking it a trouble to read the description of a place which I feel\r\nsure would please you were you to see it; especially as you can stop\r\njust when you please, and by throwing aside my letter, sit down as it\r\nwere, and give yourself a rest as often as you think proper. Besides, I\r\ngave my little passion indulgence, for I have a passion for what I have\r\nbuilt, or finished, myself. In a word, (for why should I conceal from my\r\nfriend either my deliberate opinion or my prejudice?) I look upon it as\r\nthe first duty of every writer to frequently glance over his title-page\r\nand consider well the subject he has proposed to himself; and he may be\r\nsure, if he dwells on his subject, he cannot justly be thought tedious,\r\nwhereas if, on the contrary, he introduces and drags in anything\r\nirrelevant, he will be thought exceedingly so. Homer, you know, has\r\nemployed many verses in the description of the arms of Achilles, as\r\nVirgil has also in those of Aeneas, yet neither 'of them is prolix,\r\nbecause they each keep within the limits of their original design.\r\nAratus, you observe, is not considered too circumstantial, though he\r\ntraces and enumerates the minutest stars, for he does not go out of his\r\nway for that purpose, but only follows where his subject leads him. In\r\nthe same way (to compare small things with great), so long as, in\r\nendeavouring to give you an idea of my house, I have not introduced\r\nanything irrelevant or superfluous, it is not my letter which describes,\r\nbut my villa which is described, that is to be considered large. But to\r\nreturn to where I began, lest I should justly be condemned by my own\r\nlaw, if I continue longer in this digression, you see now the reasons\r\nwhy I prefer my Tuscan villa to those which I possess at Tusculum,\r\nTiber, and Praeneste.[76] Besides the advantages already mentioned, I\r\nenjoy here a cozier, more profound and undisturbed retirement than\r\nanywhere else, as I am at a greater distance from the business of the\r\ntown and the interruption of troublesome clients. All is calm and\r\ncomposed; which circumstances contribute no less than its clear air and\r\nunclouded sky to that health of body and mind I particularly enjoy in\r\nthis place, both of which I keep in full swing by study and hunting. And\r\nindeed there is no place which agrees better with my family, at least I\r\nam sure I have not yet lost one (may the expression be allowed![77]) of\r\nall those I brought here with me. And may the gods continue that\r\nhappiness to me, and that honour to my villa. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIII -- To CALVISIUS\r\n\r\nIT is certain the law does not allow a corporate city to inherit any\r\nestate by will, or to receive a legacy. Saturninus, however, who has\r\nappointed me his heir, had left a fourth part of his estate to our\r\ncorporation of Comum; afterwards, instead of a fourth part, he\r\nbequeathed four hundred thousand sesterces.[78] This bequest, in the eye\r\nof the law, is null and void, but, considered as the clear and express\r\nwill of the deceased, ought to stand firm and valid. Myself, I consider\r\nthe will of the dead (though I am afraid what I say will not please the\r\nlawyers) of higher authority than the law, especially when the interest\r\nof one's native country is concerned. Ought I, who made them a present\r\nof eleven hundred thousand sesterces[79] out of my own patrimony, to\r\nwithhold a benefaction of little more than a third part of that sum out\r\nof an estate which has come quite by a chance into my hands? You, who\r\nlike a true patriot have the same affection for this our common country,\r\nwill agree with me in opinion, I feel sure. I wish therefore you would,\r\nat the next meeting of the Decurii, acquaint them, just briefly and\r\nrespectfully, as to how the law stands in this case, and then add that I\r\noffer them four hundred thousand sesterces according to the direction in\r\nSaturninus' will. You will represent this donation as his present and\r\nhis liberality; I only claim the merit of complying with his request. I\r\ndid not trouble to write to their senate about this, fully relying as I\r\ndo upon our intimate friendship and your wise discretion, and being\r\nquite satisfied that you are both able and willing to act for me upon\r\nthis occasion as I would for myself; besides, I was afraid I should not\r\nseem to have so cautiously guarded my expressions in a letter as you\r\nwill be able to do in a speech. The countenance, the gesture, and even\r\nthe tone of voice govern and determine the sense of the speaker, whereas\r\na letter, being without these advantages, is more liable to malignant\r\nmisinterpretation. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIV -- To MARCELLINUS\r\n\r\nI WRITE this to you in the deepest sorrow: the youngest daughter of my\r\nfriend Fundanus is dead! I have never seen a more cheerful and more\r\nlovable girl, or one who better deserved to have enjoyed a long, I had\r\nalmost said an immortal, life! She was scarcely fourteen, and yet there\r\nwas in her a wisdom far beyond her years, a matronly gravity united with\r\ngirlish sweetness and virgin bashfulness. With what an endearing\r\nfondness did she hang on her father's neck! How affectionately and\r\nmodestly she used to greet us his friends! With what a tender and\r\ndeferential regard she used to treat her nurses, tutors, teachers, each\r\nin their respective offices! What an eager, industrious, intelligent,\r\nreader she was! She took few amusements, and those with caution. How\r\nself-controlled, how patient, how brave, she was, under her last\r\nillness! She complied with all the directions of her physicians; she\r\nspoke cheerful, comforting words to her sister and her father; and when\r\nall her bodily strength was exhausted, the vigour of her mind sustained\r\nher. That indeed continued even to her last moments, unbroken by the\r\npain of a long illness, or the terrors of approaching death; and it is a\r\nreflection which makes us miss her, and grieve that she has gone from\r\nus, the more. 0 melancholy, untimely, loss, too truly! She was engaged\r\nto an excellent young man; the wedding-day was fixed, and we were all\r\ninvited. How our joy has been turned into sorrow! I cannot express in\r\nwords the inward pain I felt when I heard Fundanus himself (as grief is\r\never finding out fresh circumstances to aggravate its affliction)\r\nordering the money he had intended laying out upon clothes, pearls, and\r\njewels for her marriage, to be employed in frankincense, ointments, and\r\nperfumes for her funeral. He is a man of great learning and good sense,\r\nwho has applied himself from his earliest youth to the deeper studies\r\nand the fine arts, but all the maxims of fortitude which he has received\r\nfrom books, or advanced himself, he now absolutely rejects, and every\r\nother virtue of his heart gives place to all a parent's tenderness. You\r\nwill excuse, you will even approve, his grief, when you consider what he\r\nhas lost. He has lost a daughter who resembled him in his manners, as\r\nwell as his person, and exactly copied out all her father. So, if you\r\nshould think proper to write to him upon the subject of so reasonable a\r\ngrief, let me remind you not to use the rougher arguments of\r\nconsolation, and such as seem to carry a sort of reproof with them, but\r\nthose of kind and sympathizing humanity. Time will render him more open\r\nto the dictates of reason: for as a fresh wound shrinks back from the\r\nhand of the surgeon, but by degrees submits to, and even seeks of its\r\nown accord the means of its cure, so a mind under the first impression\r\nof a misfortune shuns and rejects all consolations, but at length\r\ndesires and is lulled by their gentle application. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLV -- To SPURINNA\r\n\r\nKNOWING, as I do, how much you admire the polite arts, and what\r\nsatisfaction you take in seeing young men of quality pursue the steps of\r\ntheir ancestors, I seize this earliest opportunity of informing you that\r\nI went to-day to hear Calpurnius Piso read a beautiful and scholarly\r\nproduction of his, entitled the Sports of Love. His numbers, which were\r\nelegiac, were tender, sweet, and flowing, at the same time that they\r\noccasionally rose to all the sublimity of diction which the nature of\r\nhis subject required. He varied his style from the lofty to the simple,\r\nfrom the close to the copious, from the grave to the florid, with equal\r\ngenius and judgment. These beauties were further recommended by a most\r\nharmonious voice; which a very becoming modesty rendered still more\r\npleasing. A confusion and concern in the countenance of a speaker\r\nimparts a grace to all he utters; for diffidence, I know not how, is\r\ninfinitely more engaging than assurance and self-sufficiency. I might\r\nmention several other circumstances to his advantage, which I am the\r\nmore inclined to point out, as they are exceedingly striking in one of\r\nhis age, and are most uncommon in a youth of his quality: but not to\r\nenter into a farther detail of his merit, I will only add that, when he\r\nhad finished his poem, I embraced him very heartily, and being persuaded\r\nthat nothing is a greater encouragement than applause, I exhorted him to\r\ngo on as he had begun, and to shine out to posterity with the same\r\nglorious lustre, which was reflected upon him from his ancestors. I\r\ncongratulated his excellent mother, and particularly his brother, who\r\ngained as much honour by the generous affection he manifested upon this\r\noccasion as Calpurnius did by his eloquence; so remarkable a solicitude\r\nhe showed for him when he began to recite his poem, and so much pleasure\r\nin his success. May the gods grant me frequent occasions of giving you\r\naccounts of this nature! for I have a partiality to the age in which I\r\nlive, and should rejoice to find it not barren of merit. I ardently\r\nwish, therefore, our young men of quality would have something else to\r\nshow of honourable memorial in their houses than the images[80] of their\r\nancestors. As for those which are placed in the mansion of these\r\nexcellent youths, I now figure them to myself as silently applauding and\r\nencouraging their pursuits, and (what is a sufficient degree of honour\r\nto both brothers) as recognizing their kindred. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVI -- To PAULINUS\r\n\r\nAs I know the humanity with which you treat your own servants, I have\r\nless reserve in confessing to you the indulgence I shew to mine. I have\r\never in my mind that line of Homer's --\r\n\r\n\"Who swayed his people with a father's love\":\r\n\r\nand this expression of ours, \"father of a family.\" But were I harsher\r\nand harder than I really am by nature, the ill state of health of my\r\nfreedman Zosimus (who has the stronger claim upon my tenderness, in that\r\nhe now stands in more especial need of it) would be sufficient to soften\r\nme. He is a good, honest fellow, attentive in his services, and well-\r\nread; but his chief talent, and indeed his distinguishing qualification,\r\nis that of a comedian, in which he highly excels. His pronunciation is\r\ndistinct, correct in emphasis, pure, and graceful: he has a very skilled\r\ntouch, too, upon the lyre, and performs with better execution than is\r\nnecessary for one of his profession. To this I must add, he reads\r\nhistory, oratory, and poetry, as well as if these had been the sole\r\nobjects of his study. I am the more particular in enumerating his\r\nqualifications, to let you see how many agreeable services I receive\r\nfrom this one servant alone. He is indeed endeared to me by the ties of\r\na long affection, which are strengthened by the danger he is now in. For\r\nnature has so formed our hearts that nothing contributes more to incite\r\nand kindle affection than the fear of losing the object of it: a fear\r\nwhich I have suffered more than once on his account. Some years ago he\r\nstrained himself so much by too strong an exertion of his voice, that he\r\nspit blood, upon which account I sent him into Egypt;[81] from whence,\r\nafter a long absence, belately returned with great benefit to his\r\nhealth. But having again exerted himself for several days together\r\nbeyond his strength, he was reminded of his former malady by a slight\r\nreturn of his cough, and a spitting of blood. For this reason I intend\r\nto send him to your farm at Forum-Julii,[82] having frequently heard you\r\nmention it as a healthy air, and recommend the milk of that place as\r\nvery salutary in disorders of his nature. I beg you would give\r\ndirections to your people to receive him into your house, and to supply\r\nhim with whatever he may have occasion for: which will not be much, for\r\nhe is so sparing and abstemious as not only to abstain from delicacies,\r\nbut even to deny himself the necessaries his ill state of health\r\nrequires. I shall furnish him towards his journey with what will be\r\nsufficient for one of his moderate requirements, who is coming under\r\nyour roof. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVII -- To RUFUS\r\n\r\nI WENT into the Julian[83] court to hear those lawyers to whom,\r\naccording to the last adjournment, I was to reply. The judges had taken\r\ntheir seats, the decemviri[84] were arrived, the eyes of the audience\r\nwere fixed upon the counsel, and all was hushed silence and expectation,\r\nwhen a messenger arrived from the praetor, and the Hundred are at once\r\ndismissed, and the case postponed: an accident extremely agreeable to\r\nme, who am never so well prepared but that I am glad of gaining further\r\ntime. The occasion of the court's rising thus abruptly was a short edict\r\nof Nepos, the praetor for criminal causes, in which he directed all\r\npersons concerned as plaintiffs or defendants in any cause before him to\r\ntake notice that he designed strictly to put in force the decree of the\r\nsenate annexed to his edict. Which decree was expressed in the following\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\r\nALL PERSONS WHOSOEVER THAT HAVE ANY LAW-SUITS DEPENDING ARE HEREBY\r\nREQUIRED AND COMMANDED, BEFORE ANY PROCEEDINGS BE HAD THEREON, TO TAKE\r\nAN OATH THAT THEY HAVE NOT GIVEN, PROMISED, OR ENGAGED TO GIVE, ANY FEE\r\nOR REWARD TO ANY ADVOCATE, UPON ACCOUNT OF HIS UNDERTAKING THEIR CAUSE.\r\n\r\nIn these terms, and many others equally full and express, the lawyers\r\nwere prohibited to make their professions venal. However, after the case\r\nis decided, they are permitted to accept a gratuity of ten thousand\r\nsesterces.[85] The praetor for civil causes, being alarmed at this order\r\nof Nepos, gave us this unexpected holiday in order to take time to\r\nconsider whether he should follow the example. Meanwhile the whole town\r\nis talking, and either approving or condemning this edict of Nepos. We\r\nhave got then at last (say the latter with a sneer) a redressor of\r\nabuses. But pray was there never a praetor before this man? Who is he\r\nthen who sets up in this way for a public reformer? Others, on the\r\ncontrary, say, \"He has done perfectly right upon his entry into office;\r\nhe has paid obedience to the laws; considered the decrees of the senate,\r\nrepressed most indecent contracts, and will not suffer the most\r\nhonourable of all professions to be debased into a sordid lucre\r\ntraffic.\" This is what one hears all around one; but which side may\r\nprevail, the event will shew. It is the usual method of the world\r\n(though a very unequitable rule of estimation) to pronounce an action\r\neither right or wrong, according as it is attended with good or ill\r\nsuccess; in consequence of which you may hear the very same conduct\r\nattributed to zeal or folly, to liberty or licentiousness, upon\r\ndifferent several occasions. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVIII -- To ARRIANUS\r\n\r\nSOMETIMES I miss Regulus in our courts. I cannot say I deplore his loss.\r\nThe man, it must be owned, highly respected his profession, grew pale\r\nwith study and anxiety over it, and used to write out his speeches\r\nthough he could not get them by heart. There was a practice he had of\r\npainting round his right or left eye,[86] and wearing a white patch[87]\r\nover one side or the other of his forehead, according as he was to plead\r\neither for the plaintiff or defendant; of consulting the soothsayers\r\nupon the issue of an action; still, all this excessive superstition was\r\nreally due to his extreme earnestness in his profession. And it was\r\nacceptable enough being concerned in the same cause with him, as he\r\nalways obtained full indulgence in point of time, and never failed to\r\nget an audience together; for what could be more convenient than, under\r\nthe protection of a liberty which you did not ask yourself, and all the\r\nodium of the arrangement resting with another, and before an audience\r\nwhich you had not the trouble of collecting, to speak on at your ease,\r\nand as long as you thought proper? Nevertheless Regulus did well in\r\ndeparting this life, though he would have done much better had he made\r\nhis exit sooner. He might really have lived now without any danger to\r\nthe public, in the reign of a prince under whom he would have had no\r\nopportunity of doing any harm. I need not scruple therefore, I think, to\r\nsay I sometimes miss him: for since his death the custom has prevailed\r\nof not allowing, nor indeed of asking more than an hour or two to plead\r\nin, and sometimes not above half that time. The truth is, our advocates\r\ntake more pleasure in finishing a cause than in defending it; and our\r\njudges had rather rise from the bench than sit upon it: such is their\r\nindolence, and such their indifference to the honour of eloquence and\r\nthe interest of justice! But are we wiser than our ancestors? are we\r\nmore equitable than the laws which grant so many hours and days of\r\nadjournments to a case? were our forefathers slow of apprehension, and\r\ndull beyond measure? and are we clearer of speech, quicker in our\r\nconceptions, or more scrupulous in our decisions, because we get over\r\nour causes in fewer hours than they took days? O Regulus! it was by zeal\r\nin your profession that you secured an advantage which is but rarely\r\ngiven to the highest integrity. As for myself, whenever I sit upon the\r\nbench (which is much oftener than I appear at the bar), I always give\r\nthe advocates as much time as they require: for I look upon it as highly\r\npresuming to pretend to guess, before a case is heard, what time it will\r\nrequire, and to set limits to an affair before one is acquainted with\r\nits extent; especially as the first and most sacred duty of a judge is\r\npatience, which constitutes an important part of justice. But this, it\r\nis objected, would give an opening to much superfluous matter: I grant\r\nit may; yet is it not better to hear too much than not to hear enough?\r\nBesides, how shall you know that what an advocate has farther to offer\r\nwill be superfluous, until you have heard him? But this, and many other\r\npublic abuses, will be best reserved for a conversation when we meet;\r\nfor I know your affection to the commonwealth inclines you to wish that\r\nsome means might be found out to check at least those grievances, which\r\nwould now be very difficult absolutely to remove. But to return to\r\naffairs of private concern: I hope all goes well in your family; mine\r\nremains in its usual situation. The good which I enjoy grows more\r\nacceptable to me by its continuance; as habit renders me less sensible\r\nof the evils I suffer. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIX -- To CALPURNIA[88]\r\n\r\nNEVER was business more disagreeable to me than when it prevented me not\r\nonly from accompanying you when you went into Campania for your health,\r\nbut from following you there soon after; for I want particularly to be\r\nwith you now, that I may learn from my own eyes whether you are growing\r\nstronger and stouter, and whether the tranquillity, the amusements, and\r\nplenty of that charming country really agree with you. Were you in\r\nperfect health, yet I could ill support your absence; for even a\r\nmoment's uncertainty of the welfare of those we tenderly love causes a\r\nfeeling of suspense and anxiety: but now your sickness conspires with\r\nyour absence to trouble me grievously with vague and various anxieties.\r\nI dread everything, fancy everything, and, as is natural to those who\r\nfear, conjure up the very things I most dread. Let me the more earnestly\r\nentreat you then to think of my anxiety, and write to me every day, and\r\neven twice a day: I shall be more easy, at least while I am reading your\r\nletters, though when I have read them, I shall immediately feel my fears\r\nagain. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLX -- To CALPURNIA\r\n\r\nYou kindly tell me my absence very sensibly affects you, and that your\r\nonly consolation is in conversing with my works, which you frequently\r\nsubstitute in my stead. I am glad that you miss me; I am glad that you\r\nfind some rest in these alleviations. In return, I read over your\r\nletters again and again, and am continually taking them up, as if I had\r\njust received them; but, alas! this only stirs in me a keener longing\r\nfor you; for how sweet must her conversation be whose letters have so\r\nmany charms? Let me receive them, however, as often as possible,\r\nnotwithstanding there is still a mixture of pain in the pleasure they\r\nafford me. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXI -- To PRISCUS\r\n\r\nYou know Attilius Crescens, and you love him; who is there, indeed, of\r\nany rank or worth, that does not? For myself, I profess to have a\r\nfriendship for him far exceeding ordinary attachments of the world. Our\r\nnative towns are separated only by a day's journey; and we got to care\r\nfor each other when we were very young; the season for passionate\r\nfriendships. Ours improved by years; and so far from being chilled, it\r\nwas confirmed by our riper judgments, as those who know us best can\r\nwitness. He takes pleasure in boasting everywhere of my friendship; as I\r\ndo to let the world know that his reputation, his ease, and his interest\r\nare my peculiar concern. Insomuch that upon his expressing to me some\r\napprehension of insolent treatment from a certain person who was\r\nentering upon the tribuneship of the people, I could not forbear\r\nanswering, --\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Long as Achilles breathes this vital air, To touch thy head no impious\r\nhand shall dare.\"<a href=\"#linknote-89\" name=\"linknoteref-89\"\r\nid=\"linknoteref-89\">[89]</a>\r\n\r\nWhat is my object in telling you these things? Why, to shew you that I\r\nlook upon every injury offered to Attilius as done to myself. \"But what\r\nis the object of all this?\" you repeat. You must know then, Valerius\r\nVarus, at his death, owed Attilius a sum of money. Though I am on\r\nfriendly terms with Maximus, his heir, yet there is a closer friendship\r\nbetween him and you. I beg therefore, and entreat you by the affection\r\nyou have for me, to take care that Attilius is not only paid the capital\r\nwhich is due to him, but all the long arrears of interest too. He\r\nneither covets the property of others nor neglects the care of his own;\r\nand as he is not engaged in any lucrative profession, he has nothing to\r\ndepend upon but his own frugality: for as to literature, in which he\r\ngreatly distinguishes himself, he pursues this merely from motives of\r\npleasure and ambition. In such a situation, the slightest loss presses\r\nhard upon a man, and the more so because he has no opportunities of\r\nrepairing any injury done to his fortune. Remove then, I entreat you,\r\nour uneasiness, and suffer me still to enjoy the pleasure of his wit and\r\nbonhommie; for I cannot bear to see the cheerfulness of my friend over-\r\nclouded, whose mirth and good humour dissipates every gloom of\r\nmelancholy in myself. In short, you know what a pleasant entertaining\r\nfellow he is, and I hope you will not suffer any injury to engloom and\r\nembitter his disposition. You may judge by the warmth of his affection\r\nhow severe his resentments would prove; for a generous and great mind\r\ncan ill brook an injury when coupled with contempt. But though he could\r\npass it over, yet cannot I: on the contrary, I shall regard it as a\r\nwrong and indignity done to myself, and resent it as one offered to my\r\nfriend; that is, with double warmth. But, after all, why this air of\r\nthreatening? rather let me end in the same style in which I began,\r\nnamely, by begging, entreating you so to act in this affair that neither\r\nAttilius may have reason to imagine (which I am exceedingly anxious he\r\nshould not) that I neglect his interest, nor that I may have occasion to\r\ncharge you with carelessness of mine: as undoubtedly I shall not if you\r\nhave the same regard for the latter as I have for the former. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXII -- To ALBINUS\r\n\r\nI WAS lately at Alsium,[90] where my mother-in-law has a villa which\r\nonce belonged to Verginius Rufus. The place renewed in my mind the\r\nsorrowful remembrance of that-great and excellent man. He was extremely\r\nfond of this retirement, and used to call it the nest of his old age.\r\nWhichever way I looked, I missed him, I felt his absence. I had an\r\ninclination to visit his monument; but I repented having seen it,\r\nafterwards: for I found it still unfinished, and this, not from any\r\ndifficulty residing in the work itself, for it is very plain, or rather\r\nindeed slight; but through the neglect of him to whose care it was\r\nentrusted. I could not see without a concern, mixed with indignation,\r\nthe remains of a man, whose fame filled the whole world, lie for ten\r\nyears after his death without an inscription, or a name. He had however\r\ndirected that the divine and immortal action of his life should be\r\nrecorded upon his tomb in the following lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Here Rufus lies, who Vindex' arms withstood, Not for himself, but for\r\nhis country's good.\"\r\n\r\nBut faithful friends are so rare, and the dead so soon forgotten, that\r\nwe shall be obliged ourselves to build even our very tombs, and\r\nanticipate the office of our heirs. For who is there that has no reason\r\nto fear for himself what we see has happened to Verginius, whose\r\neminence and distinction, while rendering such treatment more shameful,\r\nso, in the same way, make it more notorious? Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIII -- To MAXIMUS\r\n\r\nO WHAT a happy day I lately spent! I was called by the prefect of Rome,\r\nto assist him in a certain case, and had the pleasure of hearing two\r\nexcellent young men, Fuscus Salinator and Numidius Quadratus, plead on\r\nthe opposite sides: their worth is equal, and each of them will one day,\r\nI am persuaded, prove an ornament not only to the present age, but to\r\nliterature itself. They evinced upon this occasion an admirable probity,\r\nsupported by inflexible courage: their dress was decent, their elocution\r\ndistinct, their tones were manly, their memory retentive, their genius\r\nelevated, and guided by an equal solidity of judgment. I took infinite\r\npleasure in observing them display these noble qualities; particularly\r\nas I had the satisfaction to see that, while they looked upon me as\r\ntheir guide and model, they appeared to the audience as my imitators and\r\nrivals. It was a day (I cannot but repeat it again) which afforded me\r\nthe most exquisite happiness, and which I shall ever distinguish with\r\nthe fairest mark. For what indeed could be either more pleasing to me on\r\nthe public account than to observe two such noble youths building their\r\nfame and glory upon the polite arts; or more desirable upon my own than\r\nto be marked out as a worthy example to them in their pursuits of\r\nvirtue? May the gods still grant me the continuance of that pleasure!\r\nAnd I implore the same gods, you are my witness, to make all these who\r\nthink me deserving of imitation far better than I am, Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIV -- To ROMANUS\r\n\r\nYou were not present at a very singular occurrence here lately: neither\r\nwas I, but the story reached me just after it had happened. Passienus\r\nPaulus, a Roman knight, of good family, and a man of peculiar learning\r\nand culture besides, composes elegies, a talent which runs in the\r\nfamily, for Propertius is reckoned by him amongst his ancestors, as well\r\nas being his countryman. He was lately reciting a poem which began thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Priscus, at thy command\"--\r\n\r\nWhereupon Javolenus Priscus, who happened to be present as a particular\r\nfriend of the poet's, cried out--\"But he is mistaken, I did not command\r\nhim.\" Think what laughter and merriment this occasioned. Priscus's wits,\r\nyou must know, are reckoned rather unsound,[91] though he takes a share\r\nin public business, is summoned to consultations, and even publicly acts\r\nas a lawyer, so that this behaviour of his was the more remarkable and\r\nridiculous: meanwhile Paulus was a good deal disconcerted by his\r\nfriend's absurdity. You see how necessary it is for those who are\r\nanxious to recite their works in public to take care that the audience\r\nas well as the author are perfectly sane. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXV -- To TACITUS\r\n\r\nYOUR request that I would send you an account of my uncle's death, in\r\norder to transmit a more exact relation of it to posterity, deserves my\r\nacknowledgments; for, if this accident shall be celebrated by your pen,\r\nthe glory of it, I am well assured, will be rendered forever\r\nillustrious. And notwithstanding he perished by a misfortune, which, as\r\nit involved at the same time a most beautiful country in ruins, and\r\ndestroyed so many populous cities, seems to promise him an everlasting\r\nremembrance; notwithstanding he has himself composed many and lasting\r\nworks; yet I am persuaded, the mentioning of him in your immortal\r\nwritings, will greatly contribute to render his name immortal. Happy I\r\nesteem those to be to whom by provision of the gods has been granted the\r\nability either to do such actions as are worthy of being related or to\r\nrelate them in a manner worthy of being read; but peculiarly happy are\r\nthey who are blessed with both these uncommon talents: in the number of\r\nwhich my uncle, as his own writings and your history will evidently\r\nprove, may justly be ranked. It is with extreme willingness, therefore,\r\nthat I execute your commands; and should indeed have claimed the task if\r\nyou had not enjoined it. He was at that time with the fleet under his\r\ncommand at Misenum.[92] On the 24th of August, about one in the\r\nafternoon, my mother desired him to observe a cloud which appeared of a\r\nvery unusual size and shape. He had just taken a turn in the sun[93]\r\nand, after bathing himself in cold water, and making a light luncheon,\r\ngone back to his books: he immediately arose and went out upon a rising\r\nground from whence he might get a better sight of this very uncommon\r\nappearance. A cloud, from which mountain was uncertain, at this distance\r\n(but it was found afterwards to come from Mount Vesuvius), was\r\nascending, the appearance of which I cannot give you a more exact\r\ndescription of than by likening it to that of a pine tree, for it shot\r\nup to a great height in the form of a very tall trunk, which spread\r\nitself out at the top into a sort of branches; occasioned, I imagine,\r\neither by a sudden gust of air that impelled it, the force of which\r\ndecreased as it advanced upwards, or the cloud itself being pressed back\r\nagain by its own weight, expanded in the manner I have mentioned; it\r\nappeared sometimes bright and sometimes dark and spotted, according as\r\nit was either more or less impregnated with earth and cinders. This\r\nphenomenon seemed to a man of such learning and research as my uncle\r\nextraordinary and worth further looking into. He ordered a light vessel\r\nto be got ready, and gave me leave, if I liked, to accompany him. I said\r\nI had rather go on with my work; and it so happened, he had himself\r\ngiven me something to write out. As he was coming out of the house, he\r\nreceived a note from Rectina, the wife of Bassus, who was in the utmost\r\nalarm at the imminent danger which threatened her; for her villa lying\r\nat the foot of Mount Vesuvius, there was no way of escape but by sea;\r\nshe earnestly entreated him therefore to come to her assistance. He\r\naccordingly changed his first intention, and what he had begun from a\r\nphilosophical, he now carries out in a noble and generous spirit. He\r\nordered the galleys to be put to sea, and went himself on board with an\r\nintention of assisting not only Rectina, but the several other towns\r\nwhich lay thickly strewn along that beautiful coast. Hastening then to\r\nthe place from whence others fled with the utmost terror, he steered his\r\ncourse direct to the point of danger, and with so much calmness and\r\npresence of mind as to be able to make and dictate his observations upon\r\nthe motion and all the phenomena of that dreadful scene. He was now so\r\nclose to the mountain that the cinders, which grew thicker and hotter\r\nthe nearer he approached, fell into the ships, together with pumice-\r\nstones, and black pieces of burning rock: they were in danger too not\r\nonly of being aground by the sudden retreat of the sea, but also from\r\nthe vast fragments which rolled down from the mountain, and obstructed\r\nall the shore. Here he stopped to consider whether he should turn back\r\nagain; to which the pilot advising him, \"Fortune,\" said he, \"favours the\r\nbrave; steer to where Pomponianus is.\" Pomponianus was then at\r\nStabiae,[94] separated by a bay, which the sea, after several insensible\r\nwindings, forms with the shore. He had already sent his baggage on\r\nboard; for though he was not at that time in actual danger, yet being\r\nwithin sight of it, and indeed extremely near, if it should in the least\r\nincrease, he was determined to put to sea as soon as the wind, which was\r\nblowing dead in-shore, should go down. It was favourable, however, for\r\ncarrying my uncle to Pomponianus, whom he found in the greatest\r\nconsternation: he embraced him tenderly, encouraging and urging him to\r\nkeep up his spirits, and, the more effectually to soothe his fears by\r\nseeming unconcerned himself, ordered a bath to be got ready, and then,\r\nafter having bathed, sat down to supper with great cheerfulness, or at\r\nleast (what is just as heroic) with every appearance of it. Meanwhile\r\nbroad flames shone out in several places from Mount Vesuvius, which the\r\ndarkness of the night contributed to render still brighter and clearer.\r\nBut my uncle, in order to soothe the apprehensions of his friend,\r\nassured him it was only the burning of the villages, which the country\r\npeople had abandoned to the flames: after this he retired to rest, and\r\nit is most certain he was so little disquieted as to fall into a sound\r\nsleep: for his breathing, which, on account of his corpulence, was\r\nrather heavy and sonorous, was heard by the attendants outside. The\r\ncourt which led to his apartment being now almost filled with stones and\r\nashes, if he had continued there any time longer, it would have been\r\nimpossible for him to have made his way out. So he was awoke and got up,\r\nand went to Pomponianus and the rest of his company, who were feeling\r\ntoo anxious to think of going to bed. They consulted together whether it\r\nwould be most prudent to trust to the houses, which now rocked from side\r\nto side with frequent and violent concussions as though shaken from\r\ntheir very foundations; or fly to the open fields, where the calcined\r\nstones and cinders, though light indeed, yet fell in large showers, and\r\nthreatened destruction. In this choice of dangers they resolved for the\r\nfields: a resolution which, while the rest of the company were hurried\r\ninto by their fears, my uncle embraced upon cool and deliberate\r\nconsideration. They went out then, having pillows tied upon their heads\r\nwith napkins; and this was their whole defence against the storm of\r\nstones that fell round them. It was now day everywhere else, but there a\r\ndeeper darkness prevailed than in the thickest night; which however was\r\nin some degree alleviated by torches and other lights of various kinds.\r\nThey thought proper to go farther down upon the shore to see if they\r\nmight safely put out to sea, but found the waves still running extremely\r\nhigh, and boisterous. There my uncle, laying himself down upon a sail\r\ncloth, which was spread for him, called twice for some cold water, which\r\nhe drank, when immediately the flames, preceded by a strong whiff of\r\nsulphur, dispersed the rest of the party, and obliged him to rise. He\r\nraised himself up with the assistance of two of his servants, and\r\ninstantly fell down dead; suffocated, as I conjecture, by some gross and\r\nnoxious vapour, having always had a weak throat, which was often\r\ninflamed. As soon as it was light again, which was not till the third\r\nday after this melancholy accident, his body was found entire, and\r\nwithout any marks of violence upon it, in the dress in which he fell,\r\nand looking more like a man asleep than dead. During all this time my\r\nmother and I, who were at Miscnum--but this has no connection with your\r\nhistory, and you did not desire any particulars besides those of my\r\nuncle's death; so I will end here, only adding that I have faithfully\r\nrelated to you what I was either an eye-witness of myself or received\r\nimmediately after the accident happened, and before there was time to\r\nvary the truth. You will pick out of this narrative whatever is most\r\nimportant: for a letter is one thing, a history another; it is one thing\r\nwriting to a friend, another thing writing to the public. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVI -- To CORNELIUS TACITUS\r\n\r\nTHE letter which, in compliance with your request, I wrote to you\r\nconcerning the death of my uncle has raised, it seems, your curiosity to\r\nknow what terrors and dangers attended me while I continued at Misenum;\r\nfor there, I think, my account broke off:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Though my shock'd soul recoils, my tongue shall tell.\"\r\n\r\nMy uncle having left us, I spent such time as was left on my studies (it\r\nwas on their account indeed that I had stopped behind), till it was time\r\nfor my bath. After which I went to supper, and then fell into a short\r\nand uneasy sleep. There had been noticed for many days before a\r\ntrembling of the earth, which did not alarm us much, as this is quite an\r\nordinary occurrence in Campania; but it was so particularly violent that\r\nnight that it not only shook but actually overturned, as it would seem,\r\neverything about us. My mother rushed into my chamber, where she found\r\nme rising, in order to awaken her. We sat down in the open court of the\r\nhouse, which occupied a small space between the buildings and the sea.\r\nAs I was at that time but eighteen years of age, I know not whether I\r\nshould call my behaviour, in this dangerous juncture, courage or folly;\r\nbut I took up Livy, and amused myself with turning over that author, and\r\neven making extracts from him, as if I had been perfectly at my leisure.\r\nJust then, a friend of my uncle's, who had lately come to him from\r\nSpain, joined us, and observing me sitting by my mother with a book in\r\nmy hand, reproved her for her calmness, and me at the same time for my\r\ncareless security: nevertheless I went on with my author. Though it was\r\nnow morning, the light was still exceedingly faint and doubtful; the\r\nbuildings all around us tottered, and though we stood upon open ground,\r\nyet as the place was narrow and confined, there was no remaining without\r\nimminent danger: we therefore resolved to quit the town. A panic-\r\nstricken crowd followed us, and (as to a mind distracted with terror\r\nevery suggestion seems more prudent than its own) pressed on us in dense\r\narray to drive us forward as we came out. Being at a convenient distance\r\nfrom the houses, we stood still, in the midst of a most dangerous and\r\ndreadful scene. The chariots, which we had ordered to be drawn out, were\r\nso agitated backwards and forwards, though upon the most level ground,\r\nthat we could not keep them steady, even by supporting them with large\r\nstones. The sea seemed to roll back upon itself, and to be driven from\r\nits banks by the convulsive motion of the earth; it is certain at least\r\nthe shore was considerably enlarged, and several sea animals were left\r\nupon it. On the other side, a black and dreadful cloud, broken with\r\nrapid, zigzag flashes, revealed behind it variously shaped masses of\r\nflame: these last were like sheet-lightning, but much larger. Upon this\r\nour Spanish friend, whom I mentioned above, addressing himself to my\r\nmother and me with great energy and urgency: \"If your brother,\" he said,\r\n\"if your uncle be safe, he certainly wishes you may be so too; but if he\r\nperished, it was his desire, no doubt, that you might both survive him:\r\nwhy therefore do you delay your escape a moment?\" We could never think\r\nof our own safety, we said, while we were uncertain of his. Upon this\r\nour friend left us, and withdrew from the danger with the utmost\r\nprecipitation. Soon afterwards, the cloud began to descend, and cover\r\nthe sea. It had already surrounded and concealed the island of Capreae\r\nand the promontory of Misenum. My mother now besought, urged, even\r\ncommanded me to make my escape at any rate, which, as I was young, I\r\nmight easily do; as for herself, she said, her age and corpulency\r\nrendered all attempts of that sort impossible; however, she would\r\nwillingly meet death if she could have the satisfaction of seeing that\r\nshe was not the occasion of mine. But I absolutely refused to leave her,\r\nand, taking her by the hand, compelled her to go with me. She complied\r\nwith great reluctance, and not without many reproaches to herself for\r\nretarding my flight. The ashes now began to fall upon us, though in no\r\ngreat quantity. I looked back; a dense dark mist seemed to be following\r\nus, spreading itself over the country like a cloud. \"Let us turn out of\r\nthe high-road,\" I said, \"while we can still see, for fear that, should\r\nwe fall in the road, we should be pressed to death in the dark, by the\r\ncrowds that are following us.\" We had scarcely sat down when night came\r\nupon us, not such as we have when the sky is cloudy, or when there is no\r\nmoon, but that of a room when it is shut up, and all the lights put out.\r\nYou might hear the shrieks of women, the screams of children, and the\r\nshouts of men; some calling for their children, others for their\r\nparents, others for their husbands, and seeking to recognise each other\r\nby the voices that replied; one lamenting his own fate, another that of\r\nhis family; some wishing to die, from the very fear of dying; some\r\nlifting their hands to the gods; but the greater part convinced that\r\nthere were now no gods at all, and that the final endless night of which\r\nwe have heard had come upon the world.[95] Among these there were some\r\nwho augmented the real terrors by others imaginary or wilfully invented.\r\nI remember some who declared that one part of Misenum had fallen, that\r\nanother was on fire; it was false, but they found people to believe\r\nthem. It now grew rather lighter, which we imagined to be rather the\r\nforerunner of an approaching burst of flames (as in truth it was) than\r\nthe return of day: however, the fire fell at a distance from us: then\r\nagain we were immersed in thick darkness, and a heavy shower of ashes\r\nrained upon us, which we were obliged every now and then to stand up to\r\nshake off, otherwise we should have been crushed and buried in the heap.\r\nI might boast that, during all this scene of horror, not a sigh, or\r\nexpression of fear, escaped me, had not my support been grounded in that\r\nmiserable, though mighty, consolation, that all mankind were involved in\r\nthe same calamity, and that I was perishing with the world itself. At\r\nlast this dreadful darkness was dissipated by degrees, like a cloud or\r\nsmoke; the real day returned, and even the sun shone out, though with a\r\nlurid light, like when an eclipse is coming on. Every object that\r\npresented itself to our eyes (which were extremely weakened) seemed\r\nchanged, being covered deep with ashes as if with snow. We returned to\r\nMisenum, where we refreshed ourselves as well as we could, and passed an\r\nanxious night between hope and fear; though, indeed, with a much larger\r\nshare of the latter: for the earthquake still continued, while many\r\nfrenzied persons ran up and down heightening their own and their\r\nfriends' calamities by terrible predictions. However, my mother and I,\r\nnotwithstanding the danger we had passed, and that which still\r\nthreatened us, had no thoughts of leaving the place, till we could\r\nreceive some news of my uncle.\r\n\r\nAnd now, you will read this narrative without any view of inserting it\r\nin your history, of which it is not in the least worthy; and indeed you\r\nmust put it down to your own request if it should appear not worth even\r\nthe trouble of a letter. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLX VII -- To MACER\r\n\r\nHow much does the fame of human actions depend upon the station of those\r\nwho perform them! The very same conduct shall be either applauded to the\r\nskies or entirely overlooked, just as it may happen to proceed from a\r\nperson of conspicuous or obscure rank. I was sailing lately upon our\r\nlake,[96] with an old man of my acquaintance, who desired me to observe\r\na villa situated upon its banks, which had a chamber overhanging the\r\nwater. \"From that room,\" said he, \"a woman of our city threw herself and\r\nher husband.\" Upon enquiring into the cause, he informed me, \"That her\r\nhusband having been long afflicted with an ulcer in those parts which\r\nmodesty conceals, she prevailed with him at last to let her inspect the\r\nsore, assuring him at the same time that she would most sincerely give\r\nher opinion whether there was a possibility of its being cured.\r\nAccordingly, upon viewing the ulcer, she found the case hopeless, and\r\ntherefore advised him to put an end to his life: she herself\r\naccompanying him, even leading the way by her example, and being\r\nactually the means of his death; for tying herself to her husband, she\r\nplunged with him into the lake.\" Though this happened in the very city\r\nwhere I was born, I never heard it mentioned before; and yet that this\r\naction is taken less notice of than that famous one of Arria's, is not\r\nbecause it was less remarkable, but because the person who performed it\r\nwas more obscure. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVIII -- To SERVIANUS\r\n\r\nI AM extremely glad to hear that you intend your daughter for Fuscus\r\nSalinator, and congratulate you upon it. His family is patrician,[97]\r\nand both his father and mother are persons of the most distinguished\r\nmerit. As for himself, he is studious, learned, and eloquent, and, with\r\nall the innocence of a child, unites the sprightliness of youth and the\r\nwisdom of age. I am not, believe me, deceived by my affection, when I\r\ngive him this character; for though I love him, I confess, beyond\r\nmeasure (as his friendship and esteem for me well deserve), yet\r\npartiality has no share in my judgment: on the contrary, the stronger my\r\naffection for him, the more exactingly I weigh his merit. I will\r\nventure, then, to assure you (and I speak it upon my own experience) you\r\ncould not have, formed to your wishes, a more accomplished son-in-law.\r\nMay he soon present you with a grandson, who shall be the exact copy of\r\nhis father! and with what pleasure shall I receive from the arms of two\r\nsuch friends their children or grand-children, whom I shall claim a sort\r\nof right to embrace as my own! Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIX -- To SEVERUS\r\n\r\nYou desire me to consider what turn you should give to your speech in\r\nhonour of the emperor,[98] upon your being appointed consul elect.[99]\r\nIt is easy to find copies, not so easy to choose out of them; for his\r\nvirtues afford such abundant material. However, I will write and give\r\nyou my opinion, or (what I should prefer) I will let you have it in\r\nperson, after having laid before you the difficulties which occur to me.\r\nI am doubtful, then, whether I should advise you to pursue the method\r\nwhich I observed myself on the same occasion. When I was consul elect, I\r\navoided running into the usual strain of compliment, which, however far\r\nfrom adulation, might yet look like it. Not that I affected firmness and\r\nindependence; but, as well knowing the sentiments of our amiable prince,\r\nand being thoroughly persuaded that the highest praise I could offer to\r\nhim would be to show the world I was under no necessity of paying him\r\nany. When I reflected what profusion of honours had been heaped upon the\r\nvery worst of his predecessors, nothing, I imagined, could more\r\ndistinguish a prince of his real virtues from those infamous emperors\r\nthan to address him in a different manner. And this I thought proper to\r\nobserve in my speech, lest it might be suspected I passed over his\r\nglorious acts, not out of judgment, but inattention. Such was the method\r\nI then observed; but I am sensible the same measures are neither\r\nagreeable nor indeed suitable to all alike. Besides the propriety of\r\ndoing or omitting a thing depends not only upon persons, but time and\r\ncircumstances; and as the late actions of our illustrious prince afford\r\nmaterials for panegyric, no less just than recent and glorious, I doubt\r\n(as I said before) whether I should persuade you in the present instance\r\nto adopt the same plan as I did myself. In this, however, I am clear,\r\nthat it was proper to offer you by way of advice the method I pursued.\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXX -- To FABATUS\r\n\r\nI HAVE the best reason, certainly, for celebrating your birthday as my\r\nown, since all the happiness of mine arises from yours, to whose care\r\nand diligence it is owing that I am gay here and at my ease in town. --\r\nYour Camillian villa[100] in Campania has suffered by the injuries of\r\ntime, and is falling into decay; however, the most valuable parts of the\r\nbuilding either remain entire or are but slightly damaged, and it shall\r\nbe my care to see it put into thorough repair. -- Though I flatter\r\nmyself I have many friends, yet I have scarcely any of the sort you\r\nenquire after, and which the affair you mention demands. All mine lie\r\namong those whose employments engage them in town; whereas the conduct\r\nof country business requires a person of a robust constitution, and bred\r\nup to the country, to whom the work may not seem hard, nor the office\r\nbeneath him, and who does not feel a solitary life depressing. You think\r\nmost highly of Rufus, for he was a great friend of your son's; but of\r\nwhat use he can be to us upon this occasion, I cannot conceive; though I\r\nam sure he will be glad to do all he can for us. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXI -- To CORNELIANUS\r\n\r\nI RECEIVED lately the most exquisite satisfaction at Centumcellae[101]\r\n(as it is now called), being summoned thither by Cæsar[102] to attend a\r\ncouncil. Could anything indeed afford a higher pleasure than to see the\r\nemperor exercising his justice, his wisdom, and his affability, even in\r\nretirement, where those virtues are most observable? Various were the\r\npoints brought in judgment before him, and which proved, in so many\r\ndifferent instances, the excellence of the judge. The cause of Claudius\r\nAriston came on first. He is an Ephesian nobleman, of great munificence\r\nand unambitious popularity, whose virtues have rendered him obnoxious to\r\na set of people of far different characters; they had instigated an\r\ninformer against him, of the same infamous stamp with themselves; but he\r\nwas honourably acquitted. The next day, the case of Galitta, accused of\r\nadultery, was heard. Her husband, who is a military tribune, was upon\r\nthe point of offering himself as a candidate for certain honours at\r\nRome, but she had stained her own good name and his by an intrigue with\r\na centurion.[103] The husband informed the consul's lieutenant, who\r\nwrote to the emperor about it. Cæsar, having thoroughly sifted the\r\nevidence, cashiered the centurion, and sentenced him to banishment. It\r\nremained that some penalty should be inflicted likewise upon the other\r\nparty, as it is a crime of which both must necessarily be equally\r\nguilty. But the husband's affection for his wife inclined him to drop\r\nthat part of the prosecution, not without some reflections on his\r\nforbearance; for he continued to live with her even after he had\r\ncommenced this prosecution, content, it would seem, with having removed\r\nhis rival. But he was ordered to proceed in the suit: and, though he\r\ncomplied with great reluctance, it was necessary, nevertheless, that she\r\nshould be condemned. Accordingly, she was sentenced to the punishment\r\ndirected by the Julian law.[104] The emperor thought proper to specify,\r\nin his decree, the name and office of the centurion, that it might\r\nappear he passed it in virtue of military discipline; lest it should be\r\nimagined he claimed a particular cognizance in every cause of the same\r\nnature. The third day was employed in examining into an affair which had\r\noccasioned a good deal of talk and various reports; it was concerning\r\nthe codicils of Julius Tiro, part of which was plainly genuine, while\r\nthe other part, it was alleged, was forged. The persons accused of this\r\nfraud were Sempronius Senecio, a Roman knight, and Eurythmus, Cæsar's\r\nfreedman and procurator.[105] The heirs jointly petitioned the emperor,\r\nwhen he was in Dacia,[106] that he would reserve to himself the trial of\r\nthis cause; to which he consented. On his return from that expedition,\r\nhe appointed a day for the hearing; and when some of the heirs, as\r\nthough out of respect to Eurythmus, offered to withdraw the suit, the\r\nemperor nobly replied, \"He is not Polycletus,[107] nor am I Nero.\"\r\nHowever, he indulged the petitioners with an adjournment, and the time\r\nbeing expired, he now sat to hear the cause. Two of the heirs appeared,\r\nand desired that either their whole number might be compelled to plead,\r\nas they had all joined in the information, or that they also might have\r\nleave to withdraw. Cæsar delivered his opinion with great dignity and\r\nmoderation; and when the counsel on the part of Senecio and Eurythmus\r\nhad represented that unless their clients were heard, they would remain\r\nunder the suspicion of guilt,--\"I am not concerned,\" said the emperor,\r\n\"what suspicions they may lie under, it is I that am suspected;\" and\r\nthen turning to us, \"Advise me,\" said he, \"how to act in this affair,\r\nfor you see they complain when allowed to withdraw their suit.\" At\r\nlength, by the advice of the counsel, he 'ordered notice to be given to\r\nthe heirs that they should either proceed with the case or each of them\r\njustify their reasons for not doing so; otherwise that he would pass\r\nsentence upon them as calumniators.[108] Thus you see how usefully and\r\nseriously we spent our time, which however was diversified with\r\namusements of the most agreeable kind. We were every day invited to\r\nCæsar's table, which, for so great a prince, was spread with much\r\nplainness and simplicity. There we were either entertained with\r\ninterludes or passed the night in the most pleasing conversation. When\r\nwe took our leave of him the last day, he made each of us presents; so\r\nstudiously polite is Cæsar! As for myself, I was not only charmed with\r\nthe dignity and wisdom of the judge, the honour done to the assessors,\r\nthe ease and unreserved freedom of our social intercourse, but with the\r\nexquisite situation of the place itself. This delightful villa is\r\nsurrounded by the greenest meadows, and overlooks the shore, which bends\r\ninwards, forming a complete harbour. The left arm of this port is\r\ndefended by exceedingly strong works, while the right is in process of\r\ncompletion. An artificial island, which rises at the mouth of the\r\nharbour, breaks the force of the waves, and affords a safe passage to\r\nships on either side. This island is formed by a process worth seeing:\r\nstones of a most enormous size are transported hither in a large sort of\r\npontoons, and being piled one upon the other, are fixed by their own\r\nweight, gradually accumulating in the manner, as it were, of a natural\r\nmound. It already lifts its rocky back above the ocean, while the waves\r\nwhich beat upon it, being broken and tossed to an immense height, foam\r\nwith a prodigious noise, and whiten all the surrounding sea. To these\r\nstones are added wooden piers, which in process of time will give it the\r\nappearance of a natural island. This haven is to be called by the name\r\nof its great author,[109] and will prove of infinite benefit, by\r\naffording a secure retreat to ships on that extensive and dangerous\r\ncoast. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXII -- To MAXIMUS\r\n\r\nYou did perfectly right in promising a gladiatorial combat to our good\r\nfriends the citizens of Verona, who have long loved, looked up to, and\r\nhonoured, you; while it was from that city too you received that amiable\r\nobject of your most tender affection, your late excellent wife. And\r\nsince you owed some monument or public representation to her memory,\r\nwhat other spectacle could you have exhibited more appropriate to the\r\noccasion? Besides, you were so unanimously pressed to do so that to have\r\nrefused would have looked more like hardness than resolution. The\r\nreadiness too with which you granted their petition, and the magnificent\r\nmanner in which you performed it, is very much to your honour; for a\r\ngreatness of soul is seen in these smaller instances, as well as in\r\nmatters of higher moment. I wish the African panthers, which you had\r\nlargely provided for this purpose, had arrived on the day appointed, but\r\nthough they were delayed by the stormy weather, the obligation to you is\r\nequally the same, since it was not your fault that they were not\r\nexhibited. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIII -- To RESTITUTUS\r\n\r\nTHIS obstinate illness of yours alarms me; and though I know how\r\nextremely temperate you are, yet I fear lest your disease should get the\r\nbetter of your moderation. Let me entreat you then to resist it with a\r\ndetermined abstemiousness: a remedy, be assured, of all others the most\r\nlaudable as well as the most salutary. Human nature itself admits the\r\npracticability of what I recommend: it is a rule, at least, which I\r\nalways enjoin my family to observe with respect to myself. \"I hope,\" I\r\nsay to them, \"that should I be attacked with any disorder, I shall\r\ndesire nothing of which I ought either to be ashamed or have reason to\r\nrepent; however, if my distemper should prevail over my resolution, I\r\nforbid that anything be given me but by the consent of my physicians;\r\nand I shall resent your compliance with me in things improper as much as\r\nanother man would their refusal.\" I once had a most violent fever; when\r\nthe fit was a little abated, and I had been anointed,[110] my physician\r\noffered me something to drink; I held out my hand, desiring he would\r\nfirst feel my pulse, and upon his not seeming quite satisfied, I\r\ninstantly returned the cup, though it was just at my lips. Afterwards,\r\nwhen I was preparing to go into the bath, twenty days from the first\r\nattack of my illness, perceiving the physicians whispering together, I\r\nenquired what they were saying. They replied they were of opinion I may\r\npossibly bathe with safety, however that they were not without some\r\nsuspicion of risk. \"What need is there,\" said I, \"of my taking a bath at\r\nall?\" And so, with perfect calmness and tranquillity, I gave up a\r\npleasure I was upon the point of enjoying, and abstained from the bath\r\nas serenely and composedly as though I were going into it. I mention\r\nthis, not only by way of enforcing my advice by example, but also that\r\nthis letter may be a sort of tie upon me to persevere in the same\r\nresolute abstinence for the future. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIV -- To CALPURNIA[111]\r\n\r\nYou will not believe what a longing for you possesses me. The chief\r\ncause of this is my love; and then we have not grown used to be apart.\r\nSo it comes to pass that I lie awake a great part of the night, thinking\r\nof you; and that by day, when the hours return at which I was wont to\r\nvisit you, my feet take me, as it is so truly said, to your chamber, but\r\nnot finding you there, I return, sick and sad at heart, like an excluded\r\nlover. The only time that is free from these torments is when I am being\r\nworn out at the bar, and in the suits of my friends. Judge you what must\r\nbe my life when I find my repose in toil, my solace in wretchedness and\r\nanxiety. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXV -- To MACRINUS\r\n\r\nA VERY singular and remarkable accident has happened in the affair of\r\nVarenus,[112] the result of which is yet doubtful. The Bithynians, it is\r\nsaid, have dropped their prosecution of him being convinced at last that\r\nit was rashly undertaken. A deputy from that province is arrived, who\r\nhas brought with him a decree of their assembly; copies of which he has\r\ndelivered to Cæsar,[113] and to several of the leading men in Rome, and\r\nalso to us, the advocates for Varenus. Magnus,[114] nevertheless, whom I\r\nmentioned in my last letter to you, persists in his charge, to support\r\nwhich he is incessantly teasing the worthy Nigrinus. This excellent\r\nperson was counsel for him in his former petition to the consuls, that\r\nVarenus might be compelled to produce his accounts. Upon this occasion,\r\nas I attended Varenus merely as a friend, I determined to be silent. I\r\nthought it highly imprudent for me, as I was appointed his counsel by\r\nthe senate, to attempt to defend him as an accused person, when it was\r\nhis business to insist that there was actually no charge subsisting\r\nagainst him. However, when Nigrinus had finished his speech, the consuls\r\nturning their eyes upon me, I rose up, and, \"When you shall hear,\" I\r\nsaid, \"what the real deputies from the province have to object against\r\nthe motion of Nigrinus, you will see that my silence was not without\r\njust reason.\" Upon this Nigrinus asked me, \"To whom are these deputies\r\nsent?\" I replied, \"To me among others; I have the decree of the province\r\nin my hands.\" He returned, \"That is a point which, though it may be\r\nclear to you, I am not so well satisfied of.\" To this I answered,\r\n\"Though it may not be so evident to you, who are concerned to support\r\nthe accusation, it may be perfectly clear to me, who am on the more\r\nfavourable side.\" Then Polyaenus, the deputy from the province,\r\nacquainted the senate with the reasons for superseding the prosecution,\r\nbut desired it might be without prejudice to Cæsar's determination.\r\nMagnus answered him; Polyaenus replied; as for myself, I only now and\r\nthen threw in a word, observing in general a complete silence. For I\r\nhave learned that upon some occasions it is as much an orator's business\r\nto be silent as to speak, and I remember, in some criminal cases, to\r\nhave done even more service to my clients by a discreet silence than I\r\ncould have expected from the most carefully prepared speech. To enter\r\ninto the subject of eloquence is indeed very foreign to the purpose of\r\nmy letter, yet allow me to give you one instance in proof of my last\r\nobservation. A certain lady having lost her son suspected that his\r\nfreedmen, whom he had appointed coheirs with her, were guilty of forging\r\nthe will and poisoning him. Accordingly she charged them with the fact\r\nbefore the emperor, who directed Julianus Suburanus to try the cause. I\r\nwas counsel for the defendants, and the case being exceedingly\r\nremarkable, and the counsel engaged on both sides of eminent ability, it\r\ndrew together a very numerous audience. The issue was, the servants\r\nbeing put to the torture, my clients were acquitted. But the mother\r\napplied a second time to the emperor, pretending she had discovered some\r\nnew evidence. Suburanus was therefore directed to hear the cause, and\r\nsee if she could produce any fresh proofs. Julius Africanus was counsel\r\nfor the mother, a young man of good parts, but slender experience. He is\r\ngrandson to the famous orator of that name, of whom it is reported that\r\nPassienus Crispus, hearing him one day plead, archly said, \"Very fine, I\r\nmust confess, very fine; but is all this fine speaking to the purpose?\"\r\nJulius Africanus, I say, having made a long harangue, and exhausted the\r\nportion of time allotted to him, said, \"I beg you, Suburanus, to allow\r\nme to add one word more.\" When he had concluded, and the eyes of the\r\nwhole assembly had been fixed a considerable time upon me, I rose up. \"I\r\nwould have answered Africanus,\" said I, \"if he had added that one word\r\nhe begged leave to do, in which I doubt not he would have told us all\r\nthat we had not heard before.\" I do not remember to have gained so much\r\napplause by any speech that I ever made as I did in this instance by\r\nmaking none. Thus the little that I had hitherto said for Varenus was\r\nreceived with the same general approbation. The consuls, agreeably to\r\nthe request of Polyaenus, reserved the whole affair for the\r\ndetermination of the emperor, whose resolution I impatiently wait for;\r\nas that will decide whether I may be entirely secure and easy with\r\nrespect to Varenus, or must again renew all my trouble and anxiety upon\r\nhis account. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVI -- To TUSCUS\r\n\r\nYou desire my opinion as to the method of study you should pursue, in\r\nthat retirement to which you have long since withdrawn. In the first\r\nplace, then, I look upon it as a very advantageous practice (and it is\r\nwhat many recommend) to translate either from Greek into Latin or from\r\nLatin into Greek. By this means you acquire propriety and dignity of\r\nexpression, and a variety of beautiful figures, and an ease and strength\r\nof exposition, and in the imitation of the best models a facility of\r\ncreating such models for yourself. Besides, those things which you may\r\npossibly have overlooked in an ordinary reading over cannot escape you\r\nin translating: and this method will also enlarge your knowledge, and\r\nimprove your judgment. It may not be amiss, after you have read an\r\nauthor, to turn, as it were, to his rival, and attempt something ol your\r\nown upon the same topic, and then make a careful comparison between your\r\nperformance and his, in order to see in what points either you or he may\r\nbe the happier. You may congratulate yourself indeed if you shall find\r\nin some things that you have the advantage of him, while it will be a\r\ngreat mortification if he is always superior. You may sometimes select\r\nvery famous passages and compete with what you select. The competition\r\nis daring enough, but, as it is private, cannot be called impudent. Not\r\nbut that we have seen instances of persons who have publicly entered\r\nthis sort of lists with great credit to themselves, and, while they did\r\nnot despair of overtaking, have gloriously outstripped those whom they\r\nthought it sufficient honour to follow. A speech no longer fresh in your\r\nmemory, you may take up again. You will find plenty in it to leave\r\nunaltered, but still more to reject; you will add a new thought here,\r\nand alter another there. It is a laborious and tedious task, I own, thus\r\nto re-enflame the mind after the first heat is over, to recover an\r\nimpulse when its force has been checked and spent, and, worse than all,\r\nto put new limbs into a body already complete without disturbing the\r\nold; but the advantage attending this method will overbalance the\r\ndifficulty. I know the bent of your present attention is directed\r\ntowards the eloquence of the bar; but I would not for that reason advise\r\nyou never to quit the polemic, if I may so call it, and contentious\r\nstyle. As land is improved by sowing it with various seeds, constantly\r\nchanged, so is the mind by exercising it now with this subject of study,\r\nnow with that. I would recommend you, therefore, sometimes to take a\r\nsubject from history, and you might give more care to the composition of\r\nyour letters. For it frequently happens that in pleading one has\r\noccasion to make use not only of historical, but even poetical, styles\r\nof description; and then from letters you acquire a concise and simple\r\nmode of expression. You will do quite right again in refreshing yourself\r\nwith poetry: when I say so, I do not mean that species of poetry which\r\nturns upon subjects of great length and continuity (such being suitable\r\nonly for persons of leisure), but those little pieces of the sprightly\r\nkind of poesy, which serve as proper reliefs to, and are consistent\r\nwith, employments of every sort. They commonly go under the title of\r\npoetical amusements; but these amusements have sometimes gained their\r\nauthors as much reputation as works of a more serious nature; and thus\r\n(for while I am exhorting you to poetry, why should I not turn poet\r\nmyself?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As yielding wax the artist's skill commands, Submissive shap'd beneath\r\nhis forming hands; Now dreadful stands in arms a Mars confest; Or now\r\nwith Venus's softer air imprest; A wanton Cupid now the mould belies;\r\nNow shines, severely chaste, a Pallas wife: As not alone to quench the\r\nraging flame, The sacred fountain pours her friendly stream; But sweetly\r\ngliding through the flow'ry green, Spreads glad refreshment o'er the\r\nsmiling scene: So, form'd by science, should the ductile mind Receive,\r\ndistinct, each various art refin'd.\"\r\n\r\nIn this manner the greatest men, as well as the greatest orators, used\r\neither to exercise or amuse themselves, or rather indeed did both. It is\r\nsurprising how much the mind is enlivened and refreshed by these little\r\npoetical compositions, as they turn upon love, hatred, satire,\r\ntenderness, politeness, and everything, in short, that concerns life and\r\nthe affairs of the world. Besides, the same advantage attends these, as\r\nevery other sort of poems, that we turn from them to prose with so much\r\nthe more pleasure after having experienced the difficulty of being\r\nconstrained and fettered by metre. And now, perhaps, I have troubled you\r\nupon this subject longer than you desired; however, there is one thing I\r\nhave left out: I have not told you what kind of authors you should read;\r\nthough indeed that was sufficiently implied when I told you on what you\r\nshould write. Remember to be careful in your choice of authors of every\r\nkind: for, as it has been well observed, \"though we should read much, we\r\nshould not read many books.\" Who those authors are, is so clearly\r\nsettled, and so generally known, that I need not particularly specify\r\nthem; besides, I have already extended this letter to such an immoderate\r\nlength that, while suggesting how you ought to study, I have, I fear,\r\nbeen actually interrupting your studies. I will here resign you\r\ntherefore to your tablets, either to resume the studies in which you\r\nwere before engaged or to enter upon some of those I have recommended.\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXX VII -- To FABATUS (HIS WIFE'S GRANDFATHER)\r\n\r\nYou are surprised, I find, that my share of five-twelfths of the estate\r\nwhich lately fell to me, and which I had directed to be sold to the best\r\nbidder, should have been disposed of by my freedman Hermes to Corellia\r\n(without putting it up to auction) at the rate of seven hundred thousand\r\nsesterces[115] for the whole. And as you think it might have fetched\r\nnine hundred thousand,[116] you are so much the more desirous to know\r\nwhether I am inclined to ratify what he has done. I am; and listen,\r\nwhile I tell you why, for I hope that not only you will approve, but\r\nalso that my fellow-coheirs will excuse me for having, upon a motive of\r\nsuperior obligation, separated my interest from theirs. I have the\r\nhighest esteem for Corellia, both as the sister of Rufus, whose memory\r\nwill always be a sacred one to me, and as my mother's intimate friend.\r\nBesides, that excellent man Minutius Tuscus, her husband, has every\r\nclaim to my affection that a long friendship can give him; as there was\r\nlikewise the closest intimacy between her son and me, so much so indeed\r\nthat I fixed upon him to preside at the games which I exhibited when I\r\nwas elected praetor. This lady, when I was last in the country,\r\nexpressed a strong desire for some place upon the borders of our lake of\r\nComum; I therefore made her an offer, at her own price, of any part of\r\nmy land there, except what came to me from my father and mother; for\r\nthat I could not consent to part with, even to Corellia, and accordingly\r\nwhen the inheritance in question fell to me, I wrote to let her know it\r\nwas to be sold. This letter I sent by Hermes, who, upon her requesting\r\nhim that he would immediately make over to her my proportion of it,\r\nconsented. Am I not then obliged to confirm what my freedman has thus\r\ndone in pursuance of my inclinations? I have only to entreat my fellow-\r\ncoheirs that they will not take it ill at my hands that I have made a\r\nseparate sale of what I had certainly a right to dispose of. They are\r\nnot bound in any way to follow my example, since they have not the same\r\nconnections with Corellia. They are at full liberty therefore to be\r\nguided by interest, which in my own case I chose to sacrifice to\r\nfriendship. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVIII -- To CORELLIA\r\n\r\nYou are truly generous to desire and insist that I take for my share of\r\nthe estate you purchased of me, not after the rate of seven hundred\r\nthousand sesterces for the whole, as my freedman sold it to you; but in\r\nthe proportion of nine hundred thousand, agreeably to what you gave to\r\nthe farmers of the twentieths for their part. But I must desire and\r\ninsist in my turn that you would consider not only what is suitable to\r\nyour character, but what is worthy of mine; and that you would suffer me\r\nto oppose your inclination in this single instance, with the same warmth\r\nthat I obey it in all others. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIX -- To CELER\r\n\r\nEVERY author has his particular reasons for reciting his works; mine, I\r\nhave often said, are, in order, if any error should have escaped my own\r\nobservation (as no doubt they do escape it sometimes), to have it\r\npointed out to me. I cannot therefore but be surprised to find (what\r\nyour letter assures me) that there are some who blame me for reciting my\r\nspeeches: unless, perhaps, they are of opinion that this is the single\r\nspecies of composition that ought to be held exempt from any correction.\r\nIf so, I would willingly ask them why they allow (if indeed they do\r\nallow) that history may be recited, since it is a work which ought to be\r\ndevoted to truth, not ostentation? or why tragedy, as it is composed for\r\naction and the stage, not for being read to a private audience? or lyric\r\npoetry, as it is not a reader, but a chorus of voices and instruments\r\nthat it requires? They will reply, perhaps, that in the instances\r\nreferred to custom has made the practice in question usual: I should be\r\nglad to know, then, if they think the person who first introduced this\r\npractice is to be condemned? Besides the rehearsal of speeches is no\r\nunprecedented thing either with us or the Grecians. Still, perhaps, they\r\nwill insist that it can answer no purpose to recite a speech which has\r\nalready been delivered. True; if one were immediately to repeat the very\r\nsame speech word for word, and to the very same audience; but if you\r\nmake several additions and alterations; if your audience is composed\r\npartly of the same, and partly of different persons, and the recital is\r\nat some distance of time, why is there less propriety in rehearsing your\r\nspeech than in publishing it? \"But it is difficult,\" the objectors urge,\r\n\"to give satisfaction to an audience by the mere recital of a speech;\"\r\nthat is a consideration which concerns the particular skill and pains of\r\nthe person who rehearses, but by no means holds good against recitation\r\nin general. The truth is, it is not whilst I am reading, but when I am\r\nread, that I aim at approbation; and upon this principle I omit no sort\r\nof correction. In the first place, I frequently go carefully over what I\r\nhave written, by myself, after this I read it out to two or three\r\nfriends, and then give it to others to make their remarks. If after this\r\nI have any doubt concerning the justness of their observations, I\r\ncarefully weigh them again with a friend or two; and, last of all, I\r\nrecite them to a larger audience, then is the time, believe me, when I\r\ncorrect most energetically and unsparingly; for my care and attention\r\nrise in proportion to my anxiety; as nothing renders the judgment so\r\nacute to detect error as that deference, modesty, and diffidence one\r\nfeels upon those occasions. For tell me, would you not be infinitely\r\nless affected were you to speak before a single person only, though ever\r\nso learned, than before a numerous assembly, even though composed of\r\nnone but illiterate people? When you rise up to plead, are you not at\r\nthat juncture, above all others, most self-distrustful? and do you not\r\nwish, I will not say some particular parts only, but that the whole\r\narrangement of your intended speech were altered? especially if the\r\nconcourse should be large in which you are to speak? for there is\r\nsomething even in a low and vulgar audience that strikes one with awe.\r\nAnd if you suspect you are not well received at the first opening of\r\nyour speech, do you not find all your energy relaxed, and feel yourself\r\nready to give way? The reason I imagine to be that there is a certain\r\nweight of collective opinion in a multitude, and although each\r\nindividual judgment is, perhaps, of little value, yet when united it\r\nbecomes considerable. Accordingly, Pomponius Secundus, the famous tragic\r\npoet, whenever some very intimate friend and he differed about the\r\nretaining or rejecting anything in his writings, used to say, \"I\r\nappeal[117] to the people\"; and thus, by their silence or applause,\r\nadopted either his own or his friend's opinion; such was the deference\r\nhe paid to the popular judgment! Whether justly or not, is no concern of\r\nmine, as I am not in the habit of reciting my works publicly, but only\r\nto a select circle, whose presence I respect, and whose judgment I\r\nvalue; in a word, whose opinions I attend to as if they were so many\r\nindividuals I had separately consulted, at the same time that I stand in\r\nas much awe before them as I should before the most numerous assembly.\r\nWhat Cicero says of composing will, in my opinion, hold true of the\r\ndread we have of the public: \"Fear is the most rigid critic imaginable.\"\r\nThe very thought of reciting, the very entrance into an assembly, and\r\nthe agitated concern when one is there; each of these circumstances\r\ntends to improve and perfect an author's performance. Upon the whole,\r\ntherefore, I cannot repent of a practice which I have found by\r\nexperience so exceedingly useful; and am so far from being discouraged\r\nby the trifling objections of these censors that I request you would\r\npoint out to me if there is yet any other kind of correction, that I may\r\nalso adopt it; for nothing can sufficiently satisfy my anxiety to render\r\nmy compositions perfect. I reflect what an undertaking it is resigning\r\nany work into the hands of the public; and I cannot but be persuaded\r\nthat frequent revisals, and many consultations, must go to the\r\nperfecting of a performance, which one desires should universally and\r\nforever please. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXX -- To PRISCUS\r\n\r\nTHE illness of my friend Fannia gives me great concern. She contracted\r\nit during her attendance on Junia, one of the Vestal virgins, engaging\r\nin this good office at first voluntarily, Junia being her relation, and\r\nafterwards being appointed to it by an order from the college of\r\npriests: for these virgins, when excessive ill-health renders it\r\nnecessary to remove them from the temple of Vesta, are always delivered\r\nover to the care and custody of some venerable matron. It was owing to\r\nher assiduity in the execution of this charge that she contracted her\r\npresent dangerous disorder, which is a continual fever, attended with a\r\ncough that increases daily. She is extremely emaciated, and every part\r\nof her seems in a total decay except her spirits: those, indeed, she\r\nfully keeps up; and in a way altogether worthy the wife of Helvidius,\r\nand the daughter of Thrasea. In all other respects there is such a\r\nfalling away that I am more than apprehensive upon her account; I am\r\ndeeply afflicted. I grieve, my friend, that so excellent a woman is\r\ngoing to be removed from the eyes of the world, which will never,\r\nperhaps, again behold her equal. So pure she is, so pious, so wise and\r\nprudent, so brave and steadfast! Twice she followed her husband into\r\nexile, and the third time she was banished herself upon his account. For\r\nSenecio, when arraigned for writing the life of Helvidius, having said\r\nin his defence that he composed that work at the request of Fannia,\r\nMetius Carus, with a stern and threatening air, asked her whether she\r\nhad made that request, and she replied, \"I made it.\" Did she supply him\r\nlikewise with materials for the purpose? \"I did.\" Was her mother privy\r\nto this transaction? \"She was not.\" In short, throughout her whole\r\nexamination, not a word escaped her which betrayed the smallest fear. On\r\nthe contrary, she had preserved a copy of those very books which the\r\nsenate, over-awed by the tyranny of the times, had ordered to be\r\nsuppressed, and at the same time the effects of the author to be\r\nconfiscated, and carried with her into exile the very cause of her\r\nexile. How pleasing she is, how courteous, and (what is granted to few)\r\nno less lovable than worthy of all esteem and admiration! Will she\r\nhereafter be pointed out as a model to all wives; and perhaps be\r\nesteemed worthy of being set forth as an example of fortitude even to\r\nour sex; since, while we still have the pleasure of seeing and\r\nconversing with her, we contemplate her with the same admiration, as\r\nthose heroines who are celebrated in ancient story? For myself, I\r\nconfess, I cannot but tremble for this illustrious house, which seems\r\nshaken to its very foundations, and ready to fall; for though she will\r\nleave descendants behind her, yet what a height of virtue must they\r\nattain, what glorious deeds must they perform, ere the world will be\r\npersuaded that she was not the last of her family! It is an additional\r\naffliction and anguish to me that by her death I seem to lose her mother\r\na second time; that worthy mother (and what can I say higher in her\r\npraise?) of so noble a woman! who, as she was restored to me in her\r\ndaughter, so she will now again be taken from me, and the loss of Fannia\r\nwill thus pierce my heart at once with a fresh, and at the same time re-\r\nopened, wound. I so truly loved and honoured them both, that I know not\r\nwhich I loved the best; a point they desired might ever remain\r\nundetermined. In their prosperity and their adversity I did them every\r\nkindness in my power, and was their comforter in exile, as well as their\r\navenger at their return. But I have not yet paid them what I owe, and am\r\nso much the more solicitous for the recovery of this lady, that I may\r\nhave time to discharge my debt to her. Such is the anxiety and sorrow\r\nunder which I write this letter! But if some divine power should happily\r\nturn it into joy, I shall not complain of the alarms I now suffer.\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXI -- To GEMINIUS\r\n\r\nNUMIDIA QUADRATILLA is dead, having almost reached her eightieth year.\r\nShe enjoyed, up to her last illness, uninterrupted good health, and was\r\nunusually stout and robust for one of her sex. She has left a very\r\nprudent will, having disposed of two-thirds of her estate to her\r\ngrandson, and the rest to her grand-daughter. The young lady I know very\r\nslightly, but the grandson is one of my most intimate friends. He is a\r\nremarkable young man, and his merit entitles him to the affection of a\r\nrelation, even where his blood does not. Notwithstanding his remarkable\r\npersonal beauty, he escaped every malicious imputation both whilst a boy\r\nand when a youth: he was a husband at four-and-twenty, and would have\r\nbeen a father if Providence had not disappointed his hopes. He lived in\r\nthe family with his grandmother, who was exceedingly devoted to the\r\npleasures of the town, yet observed great severity of conduct himself,\r\nwhile always perfectly deferential and submissive to her. She retained a\r\nset of pantomimes, and was an encourager of this class of people to a\r\ndegree inconsistent with one of her sex and rank. But Quadratus never\r\nappeared at these entertainments, whether she exhibited them in the\r\ntheatre or in her own house; nor indeed did she require him to be\r\npresent. I once heard her say, when she was recommending to me the\r\nsupervision of her grandson's studies, that it was her custom, in order\r\nto pass away some of those unemployed hours with which female life\r\nabounds, to amuse herself with playing at chess, or seeing the mimicry\r\nof her pantomimes; but that, whenever she engaged in either of those\r\namusements, she constantly sent away her grandson to his studies: she\r\nappeared to me to act thus as much out of reverence for the youth as\r\nfrom affection. I was a good deal surprised, as I am sure you will be\r\ntoo, at what he told me the last time the Pontifical games[118] were\r\nexhibited. As we were coming out of the theatre together, where we had\r\nbeen entertained with a show of these pantomimes, \"Do you know,\" said\r\nhe, \"to-day is the first time I ever saw my grandmother's freedman\r\ndance?\" Such was the grandson's speech! while a set of men of a far\r\ndifferent stamp, in order to do honour to Quadratilla (am ashamed to\r\ncall it honour), were running up and down the theatre, pretending to be\r\nstruck with the utmost admiration and rapture at the performances of\r\nthose pantomimes, and then imitating in musical chant the mien and\r\nmanner of their lady patroness. But now all the reward they have got, in\r\nreturn for their theatrical performances, is just a few trivial\r\nlegacies, which they have the mortification to receive from an heir who\r\nwas never so much as present at these shows.--I send you this account,\r\nknowing you do not dislike hearing town news, and because, too, when any\r\noccurrence has given me pleasure, I love to renew it again by relating\r\nit. And indeed this instance of affection in Quadratilla, and the honour\r\ndone therein to that excellent youth her grandson, has afforded me a\r\nvery sensible satisfaction; as I extremely rejoice that the house which\r\nonce belonged to Cassius,[119] the founder and chief of the Cassian\r\nschool, is come into the possession of one no less considerable than its\r\nformer master. For my friend will fill it and become it as he ought, and\r\nits ancient dignity, lustre, and glory will again revive under\r\nQuadratus, who, I am persuaded, will prove as eminent an orator as\r\nCassius was a lawyer. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXII -- To MAXIMUS\r\n\r\nTHE lingering disorder of a friend of mine gave me occasion lately to\r\nreflect that we are never so good as when oppressed with illness. Where\r\nis the sick man who is either solicited by avarice or inflamed with\r\nlust? At such a season he is neither a slave of love nor the fool of\r\nambition; wealth he utterly disregards, and is content with ever so\r\nsmall a portion of it, as being upon the point of leaving even that\r\nlittle. It is then he recollects there are gods, and that he himself is\r\nbut a man: no mortal is then the object of his envy, his admiration, or\r\nhis contempt; and the tales of slander neither raise his attention nor\r\nfeed his curiosity: his dreams are only of baths and fountains. These\r\nare the supreme objects of his cares and wishes, while he resolves, if\r\nhe should recover, to pass the remainder of his days in ease and\r\ntranquillity, that is, to live innocently and happily. I may therefore\r\nlay down to you and myself a short rule, which the philosophers have\r\nendeavoured to inculcate at the expense of many words, and even many\r\nvolumes; that \"we should try and realise in health those resolutions we\r\nform in sickness.\" Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIII -- To SURA\r\n\r\nTHE present recess from business we are now enjoying affords you leisure\r\nto give, and me to receive, instruction. I am extremely desirous\r\ntherefore to know whether you believe in the existence of ghosts, and\r\nthat they have a real form, and are a sort of divinities, or only the\r\nvisionary impressions of a terrified imagination. What particularly\r\ninclines me to believe in their existence is a story which I heard of\r\nCurtius Rufus. When he was in low circumstances and unknown in the\r\nworld, he attended the governor of Africa into that province. One\r\nevening, as he was walking in the public portico, there appeared to him\r\nthe figure of a woman, of unusual size and of beauty more than human.\r\nAnd as he stood there, terrified and astonished, she told him she was\r\nthe tutelary power that presided over Africa, and was come to inform him\r\nof the future events of his life: that he should go back to Rome, to\r\nenjoy high honours there, and return to that province invested with the\r\npro-consular dignity, and there should die. Every circumstance of this\r\nprediction actually came to pass. It is said farther that upon his\r\narrival at Carthage, as he was coming out of the ship, the same figure\r\nmet him upon the shore. It is certain, at least, that being seized with\r\na fit of illness, though there were no symptoms in his case that led\r\nthose about him to despair, he instantly gave up all hope of recovery;\r\njudging, apparently, of the truth of the future part of the prediction\r\nby what had already been fulfilled, and of the approaching misfortune\r\nfrom his former prosperity. Now the following story, which I am going to\r\ntell you just as I heard it, is it not more terrible than the former,\r\nwhile quite as wonderful? There was at Athens a large and roomy house,\r\nwhich had a bad name, so that no one could live there. In the dead of\r\nthe night a noise, resembling the clashing of iron, was frequently\r\nheard, which, if you listened more attentively, sounded like the\r\nrattling of chains, distant at first, but approaching nearer by degrees:\r\nimmediately afterwards a spectre appeared in the form of an old man, of\r\nextremely emaciated and squalid appearance, with a long beard and\r\ndishevelled hair, rattling the chains on his feet and hands. The\r\ndistressed occupants meanwhile passed their wakeful nights under the\r\nmost dreadful terrors imaginable. This, as it broke their rest, ruined\r\ntheir health, and brought on distempers, their terror grew upon them,\r\nand death ensued. Even in the day time, though the spirit did not\r\nappear, yet the impression remained so strong upon their imaginations\r\nthat it still seemed before their eyes, and kept them in perpetual\r\nalarm, Consequently the house was at length deserted, as being deemed\r\nabsolutely uninhabitable; so that it was now entirely abandoned to the\r\nghost. However, in hopes that some tenant might be found who was\r\nignorant of this very alarming circumstance, a bill was put up, giving\r\nnotice that it was either to be let or sold. It happened that\r\nAthenodorus[120] the philosopher came to Athens at this time, and,\r\nreading the bill, enquired the price. The extraordinary cheapness raised\r\nhis suspicion; nevertheless, when he heard the whole story, he was so\r\nfar from being discouraged that he was more strongly inclined to hire\r\nit, and, in short, actually did so. When it grew towards evening, he\r\nordered a couch to be prepared for him in the front part of the house,\r\nand, after calling for a light, together with his pencil and tablets,\r\ndirected all his people to retire. But that his mind might not, for want\r\nof employment, be open to the vain terrors of imaginary noises and\r\nspirits, he applied himself to writing with the utmost attention. The\r\nfirst part of the night passed in entire silence, as usual; at length a\r\nclanking of iron and rattling of chains was heard: however, he neither\r\nlifted up his eyes nor laid down his pen, but in order to keep calm and\r\ncollected tried to pass the sounds off to himself as something else. The\r\nnoise increased and advanced nearer, till it seemed at the door, and at\r\nlast in the chamber. He looked up, saw, and recognized the ghost exactly\r\nas it had been described to him: it stood before him, beckoning with the\r\nfinger, like a person who calls another. Athenodorus in reply made a\r\nsign with his hand that it should wait a little, and threw his eyes\r\nagain upon his papers; the ghost then rattled its chains over the head\r\nof the philosopher, who looked up upon this, and seeing it beckoning as\r\nbefore, immediately arose, and, light in hand, followed it. The ghost\r\nslowly stalked along, as if encumbered with its chains, and, turning\r\ninto the area of the house, suddenly vanished. Athenodorus, being thus\r\ndeserted, made a mark with some grass and leaves on the spot where the\r\nspirit left him. The next day he gave information to the magistrates,\r\nand advised them to order that spot to be dug up. This was accordingly\r\ndone, and the skeleton of a man in chains was found there; for the body,\r\nhaving lain a considerable time in the ground, was putrefied and\r\nmouldered away from the fetters. The bones being collected together were\r\npublicly buried, and thus after the ghost was appeased by the proper\r\nceremonies, the house was haunted no more. This story I believe upon the\r\ncredit of others; what I am going to mention, I give you upon my own. I\r\nhave a freedman named Marcus, who is by no means illiterate. One night,\r\nas he and his younger brother were lying together, he fancied he saw\r\nsomebody upon his bed, who took out a pair of scissors, and cut off the\r\nhair from the top part of his own head, and in the morning, it appeared\r\nhis hair was actually cut, and the clippings lay scattered about the\r\nfloor. A short time after this, an event of a similar nature contributed\r\nto give credit to the former story. A young lad of my family was\r\nsleeping in his apartment with the rest of his companions, when two\r\npersons clad in white came in, as he says, through the windows, cut off\r\nhis hair as he lay, and then returned the same way they entered. The\r\nnext morning it was found that this boy had been served just as the\r\nother, and there was the hair again, spread about the room. Nothing\r\nremarkable indeed followed these events, unless perhaps that I escaped a\r\nprosecution, in which, if Domitian (during whose reign this happened)\r\nhad lived some time longer, I should certainly have been involved. For\r\nafter the death of that emperor, articles of impeachment against me were\r\nfound in his scrutore, which had been exhibited by Carus. It may\r\ntherefore be conjectured, since it is customary for persons under any\r\npublic accusation to let their hair grow, this cutting off the hair of\r\nmy servants was a sign I should escape the imminent danger that\r\nthreatened me. Let me desire you then to give this question your mature\r\nconsideration. The subject deserves your examination; as, I trust, I am\r\nnot myself altogether unworthy a participation in the abundance of your\r\nsuperior knowledge. And though you should, as usual, balance between two\r\nopinions, yet I hope you will lean more on one side than on the other,\r\nlest, whilst I consult you in order to have my doubt settled, you should\r\ndismiss me in the same suspense and indecision that occasioned you the\r\npresent application. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIV -- To SEPTITIUS\r\n\r\nYou tell me certain persons have blamed me in your company, as being\r\nupon all occasions too lavish in the praise I give my friends. I not\r\nonly acknowledge the charge, but glory in it; for can there be a nobler\r\nerror than an overflowing benevolence? But still, who are these, let me\r\nask, that are better acquainted with my friends than I am myself? Yet\r\ngrant there are any such, why will they deny me the satisfaction of so\r\npleasing a mistake? For supposing my friends not to deserve the highest\r\nencomiums I give them, yet I am happy in believing they do. Let them\r\nrecommend then this malignant zeal to those (and their number is not\r\ninconsiderable) who imagine they show their judgment when they indulge\r\ntheir censure upon their friends. As for myself, they will never be able\r\nto persuade me I can be guilty of an excess[121] in friendship,\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXV -- To TACITUS\r\n\r\nI PREDICT (and I am persuaded I shall not be deceived) that your\r\nhistories will be immortal. I frankly own therefore I so much the more\r\nearnestly wish to find a place in them. If we are generally careful to\r\nhave our faces taken by the best artists, ought we not to desire that\r\nour actions may be celebrated by an author of your distinguished\r\nabilities? I therefore call your attention to the following matter,\r\nwhich, though it cannot have escaped your notice, as it is mentioned in\r\nthe public journals, still I call your attention to, that you may the\r\nmore readily believe how agreeable it will be to me that this action,\r\ngreatly heightened by the risk which attended it, should receive\r\nadditional lustre from the testimony of a man of your powers. The senate\r\nappointed Herennius Senecio, and myself, counsel for the province of\r\nBaetica, in their impeachment of Boebius Massa. He was condemned, and\r\nthe house ordered his effects to be seized into the hands of the public\r\nofficer. Shortly after, Senecio, having learnt that the consuls intended\r\nto sit to hear petitions, came and said to me, \"Let us go together, and\r\npetition them with the same unanimity in which we executed the office\r\nwhich had been enjoined us, not to suffer Massa's effects to be\r\ndissipated by those who were appointed to preserve them.\" I answered,\r\n\"As we were counsel in this affair by order of the senate, I recommend\r\nit to your consideration whether it would be proper for us, after\r\nsentence passed, to interpose any farther.\" \"You are at liberty,\" said\r\nhe, \"to prescribe what bounds you please to yourself, who have no\r\nparticular connections with the province, except what arise from your\r\nlate services to them; but then I was born there, and enjoyed the post\r\nof quaestor among them.\" \"If such,\" I replied, \"is your determined\r\nresolution, I am ready to accompany you, that whatever resentment may be\r\nthe consequence of this affair, it may not fall singly upon yourself.\"\r\nWe accordingly proceeded to the consuls, where Senecio said what was\r\npertinent to the affair, and I added a few words to the same effect.\r\nScarcely had we ended when Massa, complaining that Senecio had not acted\r\nagainst him with the fidelity of an advocate, but the bitterness of an\r\nenemy, desired he might be at liberty to prosecute him for treason. This\r\noccasioned general consternation. Whereupon I rose up; \"Most noble\r\nconsuls,\" said I, \"I am afraid it should seem that Massa has tacitly\r\ncharged me with having favoured him in this cause, since he did not\r\nthink proper to join me with Senecio in the desired prosecution.\" This\r\nshort speech was immediately received with applause, and afterwards got\r\nmuch talked about everywhere. The late emperor Nerva (who, though at\r\nthat time in a private station, yet interested himself in every\r\nmeritorious action performed in public) wrote a most impressive letter\r\nto me upon the occasion, in which he not only congratulated me, but the\r\nage which had produced an example so much in the spirit (as he was\r\npleased to call it) of the good old days. But, whatever be the actual\r\nfact, it lies in your power to raise it into a grander and more\r\nconspicuously illustrious position, though I am far from desiring you in\r\nthe least to exceed the bounds of reality. History ought to be guided by\r\nstrict truth, and worthy actions require nothing more. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXX VI -- To SEPTITIUS\r\n\r\nI HAD a good journey here, excepting only that some of my servants were\r\nupset by the excessive heat. Poor Encolpius, my reader,[122] who is so\r\nindispensable to me in my studies and amusements, was so affected with\r\nthe dust that it brought on a spitting of blood: an accident which will\r\nprove no less unpleasant to me than unfortunate to himself, should he be\r\nthereby rendered unfit for the literary work in which he so greatly\r\nexcels. If that should unhappily result, where shall I find one who will\r\nread my works so well, or appreciate them so thoroughly as he? Whose\r\ntones will my ears drink in as they do his? But the gods seem to favour\r\nour better hopes, as the bleeding is stopped, and the pain abated.\r\nBesides, he is extremely temperate; while no concern is wanting on my\r\npart or care on his physician's. This, together with the wholesomeness\r\nof the air, and the quiet of retirement, gives us reason to expect that\r\nthe country will contribute as much to the restoration of his health as\r\nto his rest. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVII -- To CALVISIUS\r\n\r\nOTHER people visit their estates in order to recruit their purses;\r\nwhilst I go to mine only to return so much the poorer. I had sold my\r\nvintage to the merchants, who were extremely eager to purchase it,\r\nencouraged by the price it then bore, and what it was probable it would\r\nrise to: however they were disappointed in their expectations. Upon this\r\noccasion to have made the same general abatement to all would have been\r\nmuch the easiest, though not so equitable a method. Now I hold it\r\nparticularly worthy of a man of honour to be governed by principles of\r\nstrict equity in his domestic as well as public conduct; in little\r\nmatters as in great ones; in his own concerns as well as in those of\r\nothers. And if every deviation from rectitude is equally criminal,[123]\r\nevery approach to it must be equally praiseworthy. So accordingly I\r\nremitted to all in general one-eighth part of the price they had agreed\r\nto give me, that none might go away without some compensation: next, I\r\nparticularly considered those who had advanced the largest sums towards\r\ntheir purchase, and done me so much the more service, and been greater\r\nsufferers themselves. To those, therefore, whose purchase amounted to\r\nmore than ten thousand sesterces,[124] I returned (over and above that\r\nwhich I may call the general and common eighth) a tenth part of what\r\nthey had paid beyond that sum. I fear I do not express myself\r\nsufficiently clearly; I will endeavour to explain my meaning more fully:\r\nfor instance, suppose a man had purchased of me to the value of fifteen\r\nthousand sesterces,[125] I remitted to him one-eighth part of that whole\r\nsum, and likewise one-tenth of five thousand.[126] Besides this, as\r\nseveral had deposited, in different proportions, part of the price they\r\nhad agreed to pay, whilst others had advanced nothing, I thought it\r\nwould not be at all fair that all these should be favoured with the same\r\nundistinguished remission. To those, therefore, who had made any\r\npayments, I returned a tenth part upon the sums so paid. By this means I\r\nmade a proper acknowledgment to each, according to their respective\r\ndeserts, and likewise encouraged them, not only to deal with me for the\r\nfuture, but to be prompt in their payments. This instance of my good-\r\nnature or my judgment (call it which you please) was a considerable\r\nexpense to me. However, I found my account in it; for all the country\r\ngreatly approved both of the novelty of these abatements and the manner\r\nin which I regulated them. Even those whom I did not \"mete\" (as they\r\nsay) \"by the same measure,\" but distinguished according to their several\r\ndegrees, thought themselves obliged to me, in proportion to the probity\r\nof their principles, and went away pleased with having experienced that\r\nnot with me\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The brave and mean an equal honour find.\"<a href=\"#linknote-127\"\r\nname=\"linknoteref-127\" id=\"linknoteref-127\">[127]</a>\r\n\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXX VIII -- To ROMANUS\r\n\r\nHAVE you ever seen the source of the river Clitumnus? If you have not\r\n(and I hardly think you can have seen it yet, or you would have told\r\nme), go there as soon as possible. I saw it yesterday, and I blame\r\nmyself for not having seen it sooner. At the foot of a little hill, well\r\nwooded with old cypress trees, a spring gushes out, which, breaking up\r\ninto different and unequal streams, forms itself, after several\r\nwindings, into a large, broad basin of water, so transparently clear\r\nthat you may count the shining pebbles, and the little pieces of money\r\nthrown into it, as they lie at the bottom. From thence it is carried off\r\nnot so much by the declivity of the ground as by its own weight and\r\nexuberance. A mere stream at its source, immediately, on quitting this,\r\nyou find it expanded into a broad river, fit for large vessels even,\r\nallowing a free passage by each other, according as they sail with or\r\nagainst the stream. The current runs so strong, though the ground is\r\nlevel, that the large barges going down the river have no occasion to\r\nmake use of their oars; while those going up find it difficult to make\r\nheadway even with the assistance of oars and poles: and this alternate\r\ninterchange of ease and toil, according as you turn, is exceedingly\r\namusing when one sails up and down merely for pleasure. The banks are\r\nwell covered with ash and poplar, the shape and colour of the trees\r\nbeing as clearly and distinctly reflected in the stream as if they were\r\nactually sunk in it. The water is cold as snow, and as white too. Near\r\nit stands an ancient and venerable temple, in which is placed the river-\r\ngod Clitumnus clothed in the usual robe of state; and indeed the\r\nprophetic oracles here delivered sufficiently testify the immediate\r\npresence of that divinity. Several little chapels are scattered round,\r\ndedicated to particular gods, distinguished each by his own peculiar\r\nname and form of worship, and some of them, too, presiding over\r\ndifferent fountains. For, besides the principal spring, which is, as it\r\nwere, the parent of all the rest, there are several other lesser\r\nstreams, which, taking their rise from various sources, lose themselves\r\nin the river; over which a bridge is built that separates the sacred\r\npart from that which lies open to common use. Vessels are allowed to\r\ncome above this bridge, but no person is permitted to swim except below\r\nit. The Hispellates, to whom Augustus gave this place, furnish a public\r\nbath, and likewise entertain all strangers, at their own expense.\r\nSeveral villas, attracted by the beauty of this river, stand about on\r\nits borders. In short, every surrounding object will afford you\r\nentertainment. You may also amuse yourself with numberless inscriptions\r\nupon the pillars and walls, by different persons, celebrating the\r\nvirtues of the fountain, and the divinity that presides over it. Many of\r\nthem you will admire, while some will make you laugh; but I must correct\r\nmyself when I say so; you are too humane, I know, to laugh upon such an\r\noccasion. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIX -- To ARISTO\r\n\r\nAs you are no less acquainted with the political laws of your country\r\n(which include the customs and usages of the senate) than with the\r\ncivil, I am particularly desirous to have your opinion whether I was\r\nmistaken in an affair which lately came before the house, or not. This I\r\nrequest, not with a view of being directed in my judgment as to what is\r\npassed (for that is now too late), but in order to know how to act in\r\nany possible future case of the kind. You will, ask, perhaps, \"Why do\r\nyou apply for information concerning a point on which you ought to be\r\nwell instructed?\" Because the tyranny of former reigns,[128] as it\r\nintroduced a neglect and ignorance of all other parts of useful\r\nknowledge, so particularly of what relates to the customs of the senate;\r\nfor who is there so tamely industrious as to desire to learn what he can\r\nnever have an opportunity of putting in practice? Besides, it is not\r\nvery easy to retain even the knowledge one has acquired where no\r\nopportunity of employing it occurs. Hence it was that Liberty, on her\r\nreturn[129] found us totally ignorant and inexperienced; and thus in the\r\nwarmth of our eagerness to taste her sweets, we are sometimes hurried\r\noff to action, ere we are well instructed how we ought to act. But by\r\nthe institution of our ancestors, it was wisely provided that the young\r\nshould learn from the old, not only by precept, but by their own\r\nobservation, how to behave in that sphere in which they were one day\r\nthemselves to move; while these, again, in their turn, transmitted the\r\nsame mode of instruction to their children. Upon this principle it was\r\nthat the youth were sent early into the army, that by being taught to\r\nobey they might learn to command, and, whilst they followed others,\r\nmight be trained by degrees to become leaders themselves. On the same\r\nprinciple, when they were candidates for any office, they were obliged\r\nto stand at the door of the senate-house, and were spectators of the\r\npublic council before they became members of it. The father of each\r\nyouth was his instructor upon these occasions, or if he had none, some\r\nperson of years and dignity supplied the place of a father. Thus they\r\nwere taught by that surest method of discipline, Example; how far the\r\nright of proposing any law to the senate extended; what privileges a\r\nsenator had in delivering his opinion in the house; the power of the\r\nmagistrates in that assembly, and the rights of the rest of the members;\r\nwhere it is proper to yield, and where to insist; when and how long to\r\nspeak, and when to be silent; how to make necessary distinctions between\r\ncontrary opinions, and how to improve upon a former motion: in a word,\r\nthey learnt by this means every senatorial usage. As for myself, it is\r\ntrue indeed, I served in the army when I was a youth; but it was at a\r\ntime when courage was suspected, and want of spirit rewarded; when\r\ngenerals were without authority, and soldiers without modesty; when\r\nthere was neither discipline nor obedience, but all was riot, disorder,\r\nand confusion; in short, when it was happier to forget than to remember\r\nwhat one learnt. I attended likewise in my youth the senate, but a\r\nsenate shrinking and speechless; where it was dangerous to utter one's\r\nopinion, and mean and pitiable to be silent. What pleasure was there in\r\nlearning, or indeed what could be learnt, when the senate was convened\r\neither to do nothing whatever or to give their sanction to some\r\nconsummate infamy! when they were assembled either for cruel or\r\nridiculous purposes, and when their deliberations were never serious,\r\nthough often sad! But I was not only a witness to this scene of\r\nwretchedness, as a spectator; I bore my share of it too as a senator,\r\nand both saw and suffered under it for many years; which so broke and\r\ndamped my spirits that they have not even yet been able fully to recover\r\nthemselves. It is within quite recently (for all time seems short in\r\nproportion to its happiness) that we could take any pleasure in knowing\r\nwhat relates to or in setting about the duties of our station. Upon\r\nthese considerations, therefore, I may the more reasonably entreat you,\r\nin the first place, to pardon my error (if I have been guilty of one),\r\nand, in the next, to lead me out of it by your superior knowledge: for\r\nyou have always been diligent to examine into the constitution of your\r\ncountry, both with respect to its public and private, its ancient and\r\nmodern, its general and special laws. I am persuaded indeed the point\r\nupon which I am going to consult you is such an unusual one that even\r\nthose whose great experience in public business must have made them, one\r\nwould have naturally supposed, acquainted with everything were either\r\ndoubtful or absolutely ignorant upon it. I shall be more excusable,\r\ntherefore, if I happen to have been mistaken; as you will earn the\r\nhigher praise if you can set me right in an affair which it is not clear\r\nhas ever yet fallen within your observation. The enquiry then before the\r\nhouse was concerning the freedmen of Afranius Dexter, who being found\r\nmurdered, it was uncertain whether he fell by his own hands, or by those\r\nof his household; and if the latter, whether they committed the fact in\r\nobedience to the commands of Afranius, or were prompted to it by their\r\nown villainy. After they had been put to the question, a certain senator\r\n(it is of no importance to mention his name, but if you are desirous to\r\nknow, it was myself) was for acquitting them; another proposed that they\r\nshould be banished for a limited time; and a third that they should\r\nsuffer death.\r\n\r\nThese several opinions were so extremely different that it was\r\nimpossible either of them could stand with the other. For what have\r\ndeath and banishment in common with one another? Why, no more than\r\nbanishment and acquittal have together. Though an acquittal approaches\r\nrather nearer a sentence of exile than a sentence of death does: for\r\nboth the former agree at least in this that they spare life, whereas the\r\nlatter takes it away. In the meanwhile, those senators who were for\r\npunishing with death, and those who proposed banishment, sat together on\r\nthe same side of the house: and thus by a present appearance of\r\nunanimity suspended their real disagreement. I moved, therefore, that\r\nthe votes for each of the three opinions should be separately taken, and\r\nthat two of them should not, under favour of a short truce between\r\nthemselves, join against the third. I insisted that such of the members\r\nwho were for capital punishment should divide from the others who voted\r\nfor banishment; and that these two distinct parties should not be\r\npermitted to form themselves into a body, in opposition to those who\r\ndeclared for acquittal, when they would immediately after disunite\r\nagain: for it was not material that they agreed in disliking one\r\nproposal, since they differed with respect to the other two. It seemed\r\nvery extraordinary that he who moved the freedmen should be banished,\r\nand the slaves suffer death, should not be allowed to join these two in\r\none motion, but that each question should be ordered to be put to the\r\nhouse separately; and yet that the votes of one who was for inflicting\r\ncapital punishment upon the freedmen should be taken together with that\r\nof one who was for banishing them. For if, in the former instance, it\r\nwas reasonable that the motion should be divided, because it\r\ncomprehended two distinct propositions, I could not see why, in the\r\nlatter case, suffrages so extremely different should be thrown into the\r\nsame scale. Permit me, then, notwithstanding the point is already\r\nsettled, to go over it again as if it were still undecided, and to lay\r\nbefore you those reasons at my ease, which I offered to the house in the\r\nmidst of much interruption and clamour. Let us suppose there had been\r\nonly three judges appointed to hear this cause, one of whom was of\r\nopinion that the parties in question deserved death; the other that they\r\nshould only be banished; and the third that they ought to be acquitted:\r\nshould the two former unite their weight to overpower the latter, or\r\nshould each be separately balanced? For the first and second are no more\r\ncompatible than the second and third. They ought therefore in the same\r\nmanner to be counted in the senate as contrary opinions, since they were\r\ndelivered as different ones. Suppose the same person had moved that they\r\nshould both have been banished and put to death, could they possibly, in\r\npursuance of this opinion, have suffered both punishments? Or could it\r\nhave been looked upon as one consistent motion when it united two such\r\ndifferent decisions? Why then should the same opinion, when delivered by\r\ndistinct persons, be considered as one and entire, which would not be\r\ndeemed so if it were proposed by a single man? Does not the law\r\nmanifestly imply that a distinction is to be made between those who are\r\nfor a capital conviction, and those who are for banishment, in the very\r\nform of words made use of when the house is ordered to divide? You who\r\nare of such an opinion, come to this side; you who are of any other, go\r\nover to the side of him whose opinion you follow. Let us examine this\r\nform, and weigh every sentence: You who are of this opinion: that is,\r\nfor instance, you who are for banishment, come on this side; namely, on\r\nthe side of him who moved for banishment. From whence it is clear he\r\ncannot remain on this side of those who are for death. You who are for\r\nany other: observe, the law is not content with barely saying another,\r\nbut it adds any. Now can there be a doubt as to whether they who declare\r\nfor a capital conviction are of any other opinion than those who propose\r\nexile! Go over to the side of him whose opinion you follow: does not the\r\nlaw seem, as it were, to call, compel, drive over, those who are of\r\ndifferent opinions, to contrary sides? Does not the consul himself point\r\nout, not only by this solemn form of words, but by his hand and gesture,\r\nthe place in which every man is to remain, or to which he is to go over?\r\n\"But,\" it is objected, \"if this separation is made between those who\r\nvote for inflicting death, and those who are on the side of exile, the\r\nopinion for acquitting the prisoners must necessarily prevail.\" But how\r\ndoes that affect the parties who vote? Certainly it does not become them\r\nto contend by every art, and urge every expedient, that the milder\r\nsentence may not take place. \"Still,\" say they, \"those who are for\r\ncondemning the accused either capitally or to banishment should be first\r\nset in opposition to those who are for acquitting them, and afterwards\r\nweighed against each other.\" Thus, as, in certain public games, some\r\nparticular combatant is set apart by lot and kept to engage with the\r\nconqueror; so, it seems, in the senate there is a first and second\r\ncombat, and of two different opinions, the prevailing one has still a\r\nthird to contend with. What? when any particular opinion is received, do\r\nnot all the rest fall of course? Is it reasonable, then, that one should\r\nbe thrown into the scale merely to weigh down another? To express my\r\nmeaning more plainly: unless the two parties who are respectively for\r\ncapital punishment and exile immediately separate upon the first\r\ndivision of the house it would be to no purpose afterwards to dissent\r\nfrom those with whom they joined before. But I am dictating instead of\r\nreceiving instruction. -- Tell me then whether you think these votes\r\nshould have been taken separately? My motion, it is true, prevailed;\r\nnevertheless I am desirous to know whether you think I ought to have\r\ninsisted upon this point, or have yielded as that member did who\r\ndeclared for capital punishment? For convinced, I will not say of the\r\nlegality, but at least of the equity of my proposal, he receded from his\r\nopinion, and went over to the party for exile: fearing perhaps, if the\r\nvotes were taken separately (which he saw would be the case), the\r\nfreedmen would be acquitted: for the numbers were far greater on that\r\nside than on either of the other two, separately counted. The\r\nconsequence was that those who had been influenced by his authority,\r\nwhen they saw themselves forsaken by his going over to the other party,\r\ngave up a motion which they found abandoned by the first proposer, and\r\ndeserted, as it were, with their leader. Thus the three opinions were\r\nresolved at length into two; and of those two, one prevailed, and the\r\nother was rejected; while the third, as it was not powerful enough to\r\nconquer both the others, had only to choose to which of the two it would\r\nyield. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXC -- To PATERNUS\r\n\r\nTHE sickness lately in my family, which has carried off several of my\r\nservants, some of them, too, in the prime of their years, has been a\r\ngreat affliction to me. I have two consolations, however, which, though\r\nby no means equivalent to such a grief, still are consolations. One is,\r\nthat as I have always readily manumitted my slaves, their death does not\r\nseem altogether immature, if they lived long enough to receive their\r\nfreedom: the other, that I have allowed them to make a kind of\r\nwill,[130] which I observe as religiously as if they were legally\r\nentitled to that privilege. I receive and obey their last requests and\r\ninjunctions as so many authoritative commands, suffering them to dispose\r\nof their effects to whom they please; with this single restriction, that\r\nthey leave them to some one in my household, for to slaves the house\r\nthey are in is a kind of state and commonwealth, so to speak. But though\r\nI endeavor to acquiesce under these reflections, yet the same tenderness\r\nwhich led me to show them these indulgences weakens and gets the better\r\nof me. However, I would not wish on that account to become harder:\r\nthough the generality of the world, I know, look upon losses of this\r\nkind in no other view than as a diminution of their property, and fancy,\r\nby cherishing such an unfeeling temper, they show a superior fortitude\r\nand philosophy. Their fortitude and philosophy I will not dispute. But\r\nhumane, I am sure, they are not; for it is the very criterion of true\r\nmanhood to feel those impressions of sorrow which it endeavors to\r\nresist, and to admit not to be above the want of consolation. But\r\nperhaps I have detained you too long upon this subject, though not so\r\nlong as I would. There is a certain pleasure even in giving vent to\r\none's grief; especially when we weep on the bosom of a friend who will\r\napprove, or, at least, pardon, our tears. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCI -- To MACRINUS\r\n\r\nIs the weather with you as rude and boisterous as it is with us? All\r\nhere is in tempest and inundation. The Tiber has swelled its channel,\r\nand overflowed its banks far and wide. Though the wise precaution of the\r\nemperor had guarded against this evil, by cutting several outlets to the\r\nriver, it has nevertheless flooded all the fields and valleys and\r\nentirely overspread the whole face of the flat country. It seems to have\r\ngone out to meet those rivers which it used to receive and carry off in\r\none united stream, and has driven them back to deluge those countries it\r\ncould not reach itself. That most delightful of rivers, the Anio, which\r\nseems invited and detained in its course by the villas built along its\r\nbanks, has almost entirely rooted up and carried away the woods which\r\nshaded its borders. It has overthrown whole mountains, and, in\r\nendeavouring to find a passage through the mass of ruins that obstructed\r\nits way, has forced down houses, and risen and spread over the\r\ndesolation it has occasioned. The inhabitants of the hill countries, who\r\nare situated above the reach of this inundation, have been the\r\nmelancholy spectators of its dreadful effects, having seen costly\r\nfurniture, instruments of husbandry, ploughs, and oxen with their\r\ndrivers, whole herds of cattle, together with the trunks of trees, and\r\nbeams of the neighbouring villas, floating about in different parts. Nor\r\nindeed have these higher places themselves, to which the waters could\r\nnot reach up, escaped the calamity. A continued heavy rain and\r\ntempestuous hurricane, as destructive as the river itself, poured down\r\nupon them, and has destroyed all the enclosures which divided that\r\nfertile country. It has damaged likewise, and even overturned, some of\r\nthe public buildings, by the fall of which great numbers have been\r\nmaimed, smothered, bruised. And thus lamentation over the fate of\r\nfriends has been added to losses. I am extremely uneasy lest this\r\nextensive ruin should have spread to you: I beg therefore, if it has\r\nnot, you will immediately relieve my anxiety; and indeed I desire you\r\nwould inform me though it should have done so; for the difference is not\r\ngreat between fearing a danger, and feeling it; except that the evil one\r\nfeels has some bounds, whereas one's apprehensions have none. For we can\r\nsuffer no more than what actually has happened but we fear all that\r\npossibly could happen. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCII -- To RUFINUS\r\n\r\nThe common notion is certainly quite a false one, that a man's will is a\r\nkind of mirror in which we may clearly discern his real character, for\r\nDomitius Tullus appears a much better man since his death than he did\r\nduring his lifetime. After having artfully encouraged the expectations\r\nof those who paid court to him, with a view to being his heirs, he has\r\nleft his estate to his niece whom he adopted. He has given likewise\r\nseveral very considerable legacies among his grandchildren, and also to\r\nhis great-grandson. In a word, he has shown himself a most kind relation\r\nthroughout his whole will; which is so much the more to be admired as it\r\nwas not expected of him. This affair has been very much talked about,\r\nand various opinions expressed: some call him false, ungrateful, and\r\nforgetful, and, while thus railing at him in this way as if they were\r\nactually disinherited kindred, betray their own dishonest designs:\r\nothers, on the contrary, applaud him extremely for having disappointed\r\nthe hopes of this infamous tribe of men, whom, considering the\r\ndisposition of the times, it is but prudence to deceive. They add that\r\nhe was not at liberty to make any other will, and that he cannot so\r\nproperly be said to have bequeathed, as returned, his estate to his\r\nadopted daughter, since it was by her means it came to him. For\r\nCurtilius Mancia, whose daughter Domitius Lucanus, brother to this\r\nTullus, married, having taken a dislike to his son-in-law, made this\r\nyoung lady (who was the issue of that marriage) his heiress, upon\r\ncondition that Lucanus her father would emancipate her. He accordingly\r\ndid so, but she being afterwards adopted by Tullus, her uncle, the\r\ndesign of Mancia's will was entirely frustrated. For these two brothers\r\nhaving never divided their patrimony, but living together as joint-\r\ntenants of one common estate, the daughter of Lucanus, notwithstanding\r\nthe act of emancipation, returned back again, together with her large\r\nfortune, under the dominion of her father, by means of this fraudulent\r\nadoption. It seems indeed to have been the fate of these two brothers to\r\nbe enriched by those who had the greatest aversion to them. For Domitius\r\nAfer, by whom they were adopted, left a will in their favour, which he\r\nhad made eighteen years before his death; though it was plain he had\r\nsince altered his opinion with regard to the family, because he was\r\ninstrumental in procuring the confiscation of their father's estate.\r\nThere is something extremely singular in the resentment of Afer, and the\r\ngood fortune of the other two; as it was very extraordinary, on the one\r\nhand, that Domitius should endeavour to extirpate from the privileges of\r\nsociety a man whose children he had adopted, and, on the other, that\r\nthese brothers should find a parent in the very person that ruined their\r\nfather. But Tullus acted justly, after having been appointed sole heir\r\nby his brother, in prejudice to his own daughter, to make her amends by\r\ntransferring to her this estate, which came to him from Afer, as well as\r\nall the rest which he had gained in partnership with his brother. His\r\nwill therefore deserves the higher praise, having been dictated by\r\nnature, justice, and sense of honour; in which he has returned his\r\nobligations to his several relations, according to their respective good\r\noffices towards him, not forgetting his wife, having bequeathed to that\r\nexcellent woman, who patiently endured much for his sake, several\r\ndelightful villas, besides a large sum of money. And indeed she deserved\r\nso much the more at his hands, in proportion to the displeasure she\r\nincurred on her marriage with him. It was thought unworthy a person of\r\nher birth and repute, so long left a widow by her former husband, by\r\nwhom she had issue, to marry, in the decline of her life, an old man,\r\nmerely for his wealth, and who was so sickly and infirm that, even had\r\nhe passed the best years of his youth and health with her, she might\r\nwell have been heartily tired of him. He had so entirely lost the use of\r\nall his limbs that he could not move himself in bed without assistance;\r\nand the only enjoyment he had of his riches was to contemplate them. He\r\nwas even (sad and disgusting to relate) reduced to the necessity of\r\nhaving his teeth washed and scrubbed by others: in allusion to which he\r\nused frequently to say, when he was complaining of the indignities which\r\nhis infirmities obliged him to suffer, that he was every day compelled\r\nto lick his servant's fingers. Still, however, he lived on, and was\r\nwilling to accept of life upon such terms. That he lived so long as he\r\ndid was particularly owing, indeed, to the care of his wife, who,\r\nwhatever reputation she might lose at first by her marriage, acquired\r\ngreat honour by her unwearied devotion as his wife. -- Thus I have given\r\nyou all the news of the town, where nothing is talked of but Tullus. It\r\nis expected his curiosities will shortly be sold by auction. He had such\r\nan abundant collection of very old statues that he actually filled an\r\nextensive garden with them, the very same day he purchased it; not to\r\nmention numberless other antiques, lying neglected in his lumber-room.\r\nIf you have anything worth telling me in return, I hope you will not\r\nrefuse the trouble of writing to me: not only as we are all of us\r\nnaturally fond, you know, of news, but because example has a very\r\nbeneficial influence upon our own conduct. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIII -- To GALLUS\r\n\r\nTHOSE works of art or nature which are usually the motives of our\r\ntravels are often overlooked and neglected if they lie within our reach:\r\nwhether it be that we are naturally less inquisitive concerning those\r\nthings which are near us, while our curiosity is excited by remote\r\nobjects; or because the easiness of gratifying a desire is always sure\r\nto damp it; or, perhaps, that we put off from time to time going and\r\nseeing what we know we have an opportunity of seeing when we please.\r\nWhatever the reason be, it is certain there are numberless curiosities\r\nin and near Rome which we have not only never seen, but even never so\r\nmuch as heard of: and yet had they been the produce of Greece, or Egypt,\r\nor Asia, or any other country which we admire as fertile and productive\r\nof belief in wonders, we should long since have heard of them, read of\r\nthem, and enquired into them. For myself at least, I confess, I have\r\nlately been entertained with one of these curiosities, to which I was an\r\nentire stranger before. My wife's grandfather desired I would look over\r\nhis estate near Ameria.[131] As I was walking over his grounds, 1 was\r\nshown a lake that lies below them, called Vadirnon,[132] about which\r\nseveral very extraordinary things are told. I went up to this lake. It\r\nis perfectly circular in form, like a wheel lying on the ground; there\r\nis not the least curve or projection of the shore, but all is regular,\r\neven, and just as if it had been hollowed and cut out by the hand of\r\nart. The water is of a clear sky-blue, though with somewhat of a\r\ngreenish tinge; its smell is sulphurous, and its flavour has medicinal\r\nproperties, and is deemed of great efficacy in all fractures of the\r\nlimbs, which it is supposed to heal. Though of but moderate extent, yet\r\nthe winds have a great effect upon it, throwing it into violent\r\nagitation. No vessels are suffered to sail here, as its waters are held\r\nsacred; but several floating islands swim about it, covered with reeds\r\nand rushes, and with whatever other plants the surrounding marshy ground\r\nand the edge itself of the lake produce in greater abundance. Each\r\nisland has its peculiar shape and size, but the edges of all of them are\r\nworn away by their frequent collision with the shore and one another.\r\nThey are all of the same height and motion; as their respective roots,\r\nwhich are formed like the keel of a boat, may be seen hanging not very\r\nfar down in the water, and at an equal depth, on whichever side you\r\nstand. Sometimes they move in a cluster, and seem to form one entire\r\nlittle continent; sometimes they are dispersed into different quarters\r\nby the wind; at other times, when it is calm, they float up and down\r\nseparately. You may frequently see one of the larger islands sailing\r\nalong with a lesser joined to it, like a ship with its long boat; or,\r\nperhaps, seeming to strive which shall out-swim the other: then again\r\nthey are all driven to the same spot, and by joining themselves to the\r\nshore, sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other, lessen or\r\nrestore the size of the lake in this part or that, accordingly, till at\r\nlast uniting in the centre they restore it to its usual size. The sheep\r\nwhich graze upon the borders of this lake frequently go upon these\r\nislands to feed, without perceiving that they have left the shore, until\r\nthey are alarmed by finding themselves surrounded with water; as though\r\nthey had been forcibly conveyed and placed there. Afterwards, when the\r\nwind drives them back again, they as little perceive their return as\r\ntheir departure. This lake empties itself into a river, which, after\r\nrunning a little way, sinks under ground, and, if anything is thrown in,\r\nit brings it up again where the stream emerges.--I have given you this\r\naccount because I imagined it would not be less new, nor less agreeable,\r\nto you than it was to me; as I know you take the same pleasure as myself\r\nin contemplating the works of nature. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIV -- To ARRIANUS\r\n\r\nNOTHING, in my opinion, gives a more amiable and becoming grace to our\r\nstudies, as well as manners, than to temper the serious with the gay,\r\nlest the former should degenerate into melancholy, and the latter run up\r\ninto levity. Upon this plan it is that I diversify my graver works with\r\ncompositions of a lighter nature. I had chosen a convenient place and\r\nseason for some productions of that sort to make their appearance in;\r\nand designing to accustom them early to the tables of the idle, I fixed\r\nupon the month of July, which is usually a time of vacation to the\r\ncourts of justice, in order to read them to some of my friends I had\r\ncollected together; and accordingly I placed a desk before each couch.\r\nBut as I happened that morning to be unexpectedly called away to attend\r\na cause, I took occasion to preface my recital with an apology. I\r\nentreated my audience not to impute it to me as any want of due regard\r\nfor the business to which I had invited them that on the very day I had\r\nappointed for reading my performances to a small circle of my friends I\r\ndid not refuse my services to others in their law affairs. I assured\r\nthem I would observe the same rule in my writings, and should always\r\ngive the preference to business, before pleasure; to serious engagements\r\nbefore amusing ones; and to my friends before myself. The poems I\r\nrecited consisted of a variety of subjects in different metres. It is\r\nthus that we who dare not rely for much upon our abilities endeavour to\r\navoid satiating our readers. In compliance with the earnest solicitation\r\nof my audience, I recited for two days successively; but not in the\r\nmanner that several practise, by passing over the feebler passages, and\r\nmaking a merit of so doing: on the contrary, I omitted nothing, and\r\nfreely confessed it. I read the whole, that I might correct the whole;\r\nwhich it is impossible those who only select particular passages can do.\r\nThe latter method, indeed, may have more the appearance of modesty, and\r\nperhaps respect; but the former shows greater simplicity, as well as a\r\nmore affectionate disposition towards the audience. For the belief that\r\na man's friends have so much regard for him as not to be weary on these\r\noccasions, is a sure indication of the love he bears them. Otherwise,\r\nwhat good do friends do you who assemble merely for their own amusement?\r\nHe who had rather find his friend's performance correct, than make it\r\nso, is to be regarded as a stranger, or one who is too lackadaisical to\r\ngive himself any trouble. Your affection for me leaves me no room to\r\ndoubt that you are impatient to read my book, even in its present very\r\nimperfect condition. And so you shall, but not until I have made those\r\ncorrections which were the principal inducement of my recital. You are\r\nalready acquainted with some parts of it; but even those, after they\r\nhave been improved (or perhaps spoiled, as is sometimes the case by the\r\ndelay of excessive revision) will seem quite new to you. For when a\r\npiece has undergone various changes, it gets to look new, even in those\r\nvery parts which remain unaltered. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCV -- To MAXIMUS\r\n\r\nMy affection for you obliges me, not indeed to direct you (for you are\r\nfar above the want of a guide), but to admonish you carefully to observe\r\nand resolutely to put in practice what you already know, that is, in\r\nother words, to know it to better purpose. Consider that you are sent to\r\nthat noble province, Achaia, the real and genuine Greece, where\r\npoliteness, learning, and even agriculture itself, are supposed to have\r\ntaken their first rise; sent to regulate the condition of free cities;\r\nsent, that is, to a society of men who breathe the spirit of true\r\nmanhood and liberty; who have maintained the rights they received from\r\nNature, by courage, by virtue, by alliances; in a word, by civil and\r\nreligious faith. Revere the gods their founders; their ancient glory,\r\nand even that very antiquity itself which, venerable in men, is sacred\r\nin states. Honour them therefore for their deeds of old renown, nay,\r\ntheir very legendary traditions. Grant to every one his full dignity,\r\nprivileges, yes, and the indulgence of his very vanity. Remember it was\r\nfrom this nation we derived our laws; that she did not receive ours by\r\nconquest, but gave us hers by favour. Remember, it is Athens to which\r\nyou go; it is Lacedaemon you govern; and to deprive such a people of the\r\ndeclining shadow, the remaining name of liberty, would be cruel,\r\ninhuman, barbarous. Physicians, you see, though in sickness there is no\r\ndifference between freedom and slavery, yet treat persons of the former\r\nrank with more tenderness than those of the latter. Reflect what these\r\ncities once were; but so reflect as not to despise them for what they\r\nare now. Far be pride and asperity from my friend; nor fear, by a proper\r\ncondescension, to lay yourself open to contempt. Can he who is vested\r\nwith the power and bears the ensigns of authority, can he fail of\r\nmeeting with respect, unless by pursuing base and sordid measures, and\r\nfirst breaking through that reverence he owes to himself? Ill, believe\r\nme, is power proved by insult; ill can terror command veneration, and\r\nfar more effectual is affection in obtaining one's purpose than fear.\r\nFor terror operates no longer than its object is present, but love\r\nproduces its effects with its object at a distance: and as absence\r\nchanges the former into hatred, it raises the latter into respect. And\r\ntherefore you ought (and I cannot but repeat it too often), you ought to\r\nwell consider the nature of your office, and to represent to yourself\r\nhow great and important the task is of governing a free state. For what\r\ncan be better for society than such government, what can be more\r\nprecious than freedom? How ignominious then must his conduct be who\r\nturns good government into anarchy, and liberty into slavery? To these\r\nconsiderations let me add, that you have an established reputation to\r\nmaintain: the fame you acquired by the administration of the\r\nquaestorship in Bithynia,[133] the good opinion of the emperor, the\r\ncredit you obtained when you were tribune and praetor, in a word, this\r\nvery government, which may be looked upon as the reward of your former\r\nservices, are all so many glorious weights which are incumbent upon you\r\nto support with suitable dignity. The more strenuously therefore you\r\nought to endeavour that it may not be said you showed greater urbanity,\r\nintegrity, and ability in a province remote from Rome, than in one which\r\nlies so much nearer the capital; in the midst of a nation of slaves,\r\nthan among a free people; that it may not be remarked, that it was\r\nchance, and not judgment, appointed you to this office; that your\r\ncharacter was unknown and unexperienced, not tried and approved. For\r\n(and it is a maxim which your reading and conversation must have often\r\nsuggested to you) it is a far greater disgrace losing the name one has\r\nonce acquired than never to have attained it. I again beg you to be\r\npersuaded that I did not write this letter with a design of instruction,\r\nbut of reminder. Though indeed, if I had, it would have only been in\r\nconsequence of the great affection I bear you: a sentiment which I am in\r\nno fear of carrying beyond its just bounds: for there can be no danger\r\nof excess where one cannot love too well. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVI -- To PAULINUS\r\n\r\nOTHERS may think as they please; but the happiest man, in my opinion, is\r\nhe who lives in the conscious anticipation of an honest and enduring\r\nname, and secure of future glory in the eyes of posterity. I confess, if\r\nI had not the reward of an immortal reputation in view, I should prefer\r\na life of uninterrupted ease and indolent retirement to any other. There\r\nseems to be two points worthy every man's attention: endless fame, or\r\nthe short duration of life. Those who are actuated by the former motive\r\nought to exert themselves to the very utmost of their power; while such\r\nas are influenced by the latter should quietly resign themselves to\r\nrepose, and not wear out a short life in perishable pursuits, as we see\r\nso many doing--and then sink at last into utter self-contempt, in the\r\nmidst of a wretched and fruitless course of false industry. These are my\r\ndaily reflections, which I communicate to you, in order to renounce them\r\nif you do not agree with them; as undoubtedly you will, who are for ever\r\nmeditating some glorious and immortal enterprise. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVII -- To CALVISIUS\r\n\r\nI HAVE spent these several days past, in reading and writing, with the\r\nmost pleasing tranquillity imaginable. You will ask, \"How that can\r\npossibly be in the midst of Rome?\" It was the time of celebrating the\r\nCircensian games; an entertainment for which I have not the least taste.\r\nThey have no novelty, no variety to recommend them, nothing, in short,\r\none would wish to see twice. It does the more surprise me therefore that\r\nso many thousand people should be possessed with the childish passion of\r\ndesiring so often to see a parcel of horses gallop, and men standing\r\nupright in their chariots. If, indeed, it were the swiftness of the\r\nhorses, or the skill of the men that attracted them, there might be some\r\npretence of reason for it. But it is the dress[134] they like; it is the\r\ndress that takes their fancy. And if, in the midst of the course and\r\ncontest, the different parties were to change colours, their different\r\npartisans would change sides, and instantly desert the very same men and\r\nhorses whom just before they were eagerly following with their eyes, as\r\nfar as they could see, and shouting out their names with all their\r\nmight. Such mighty charms, such wondrous power reside in the colour of a\r\npaltry tunic! And this not only with the common crowd (more contemptible\r\nthan the dress they espouse), but even with serious-thinking people.\r\nWhen I observe such men thus insatiably fond of so silly, so low, so\r\nuninteresting, so common an entertainment, I congratulate myself on my\r\nindifference to these pleasures: and am glad to employ the leisure of\r\nthis season upon my books, which others throw away upon the most idle\r\noccupations. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVIII -- To ROMANUS\r\n\r\nI AM pleased to find by your letter that you are engaged in building;\r\nfor I may now defend my own conduct by your example. I am myself\r\nemployed in the same sort of work; and since I have you, who shall deny\r\nI have reason on my side? Our situations too are not dissimilar; your\r\nbuildings are carried on upon the sea-coast, mine are rising upon the\r\nside of the Larian lake. I have several villas upon the borders of this\r\nlake, but there are two particularly in which, as I take most delight,\r\nso they give me most employment. They are both situated like those at\r\nBaiae:[135] one of them stands upon a rock, and overlooks the lake; the\r\nother actually touches it. The first, supported as it were by the lofty\r\nbuskin,[136] I call my tragic; the other, as resting upon the humble\r\nrock, my comic villa. Each has its own peculiar charm, recommending it\r\nto its possessor so much more on account of this very difference. The\r\nformer commands a wider, the latter enjoys a nearer view of the lake.\r\nOne, by a gentle curve, embraces a little bay; the other, being built\r\nupon a greater height, forms two. Here you have a strait walk extending\r\nitself along the banks of the lake; there, a spacious terrace that falls\r\nby a gentle descent towards it. The former does not feel the force of\r\nthe waves; the latter breaks them; from that you see the fishing-\r\nvessels; from this you may fish yourself, and throw your line out of\r\nyour room, and almost from your bed, as from off a boat. It is the\r\nbeauties therefore these agreeable villas possess that tempt me to add\r\nto them those which are wanting.--But I need not assign a reason to you;\r\nwho, undoubtedly, will think it a sufficient one that I follow your\r\nexample. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIX -- To GEMINUS\r\n\r\nYOUR letter was particularly acceptable to me, as it mentioned your\r\ndesire that I would send you something of mine, addressed to you, to\r\ninsert in your works. I shall find a more appropriate occasion of\r\ncomplying with your request than that which you propose, the subject you\r\npoint out to me being attended with some objections; and when you\r\nreconsider it, you will think so.--As I did not imagine there were any\r\nbooksellers at Lugdunum,[137] I am so much the more pleased to learn\r\nthat my works are sold there. I rejoice to find they maintain the\r\ncharacter abroad which they raised at home, and I begin to flatter\r\nmyself they have some merit, since persons of such distant countries are\r\nagreed in their opinion with regard to them. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC -- To JUNIOR\r\n\r\nA CERTAIN friend of mine lately chastised his son, in my presence, for\r\nbeing somewhat too expensive in the matter of dogs and horses. \"And\r\npray,\" I asked him, when the youth had left us, \"did you never commit a\r\nfault yourself which deserved your father's correction? Did you never? I\r\nrepeat. Nay, are you not sometimes even now guilty of errors which your\r\nson, were he in your place, might with equal gravity reprove? Are not\r\nall mankind subject to indiscretions? And have we not each of us our\r\nparticular follies in which we fondly indulge ourselves?\"[138]\r\n\r\nThe great affection I have for you induced me to set this instance of\r\nunreasonable severity before you--a caution not to treat your son with\r\ntoo much harshness and severity. Consider, he is but a boy, and that\r\nthere was a time when you were so too. In exerting, therefore, the\r\nauthority of a father, remember always that you are a man, and the\r\nparent of a man. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCI -- To QUADRATUS\r\n\r\nTHE pleasure and attention with which you read the vindication I\r\npublished of Helvidius,[139] has greatly raised your curiosity, it\r\nseems, to be informed of those particulars relating to that affair,\r\nwhich are not mentioned in the defence; as you were too young to be\r\npresent yourself at that transaction. When Domitian was assassinated, a\r\nglorious opportunity, I thought, offered itself to me of pursuing the\r\nguilty, vindicating the injured, and advancing my own reputation. But\r\namidst an infinite variety of the blackest crimes, none appeared to me\r\nmore atrocious than that a senator, of praetorian dignity, and invested\r\nwith the sacred character of a judge, should, even in the very senate\r\nitself, lay violent hands upon a member[140] of that body, one of\r\nconsular rank, and who then stood arraigned before him. Besides this\r\ngeneral consideration, I also happened to be on terms of particular\r\nintimacy with Helvidius, as far as this was possible with one who,\r\nthrough fear of the times, endeavoured to veil the lustre of his fame,\r\nand his virtues, in obscurity and retirement. Arria likewise, and her\r\ndaughter Fannia, who was mother-in-law to Helvidius, were in the number\r\nof my friends. But it was not so much private attachments as the honour\r\nof the public, a just indignation at the action, and the danger of the\r\nexample if it should pass unpunished, that animated me upon the\r\noccasion. At the first restoration of liberty every man singled out his\r\nown particular enemy (though it must be confessed, those only of a lower\r\nrank), and, in the midst of much clamour and confusion, no sooner\r\nbrought the charge than procured the condemnation. But for myself, I\r\nthought it would be more reasonable and more effectual, not to take\r\nadvantage of the general resentment of the public, but to crush this\r\ncriminal with the single weight of his own enormous guilt. When\r\ntherefore the first heat of public indignation began to cool, and\r\ndeclining passion gave way to justice, though I was at that time under\r\ngreat affliction for the loss of my wife,[142] I sent to Anteia, the\r\nwidow of Helvidius, and desired her to come to me, as my late misfortune\r\nprevented me from appearing in public. When she arrived, I said to her,\r\n\"I am resolved not to suffer the injuries your husband has received, to\r\npass unrevenged; let Arria and Fannia\" (who were just returned from\r\nexile) \"know this; and consider together whether you would care to join\r\nwith me in the prosecution. Not that I want an associate, but I am not\r\nso jealous of my own glory as to refuse to share it with you in this\r\naffair.\" She accordingly carried this message; and they all agreed to\r\nthe proposal without the least hesitation. It happened very opportunely\r\nthat the senate was to meet within three days. It was a general rule\r\nwith me to consult, in all my affairs, with Corellius, a person of the\r\ngreatest far-sightedness and wisdom this age has produced. However, in\r\nthe present case, I relied entirely upon my own discretion, being\r\napprehensive he would not approve of my design, as he was very cautious\r\nand deliberate. But though I did not previously take counsel with him\r\n(experience having taught me, never to do so with a person concerning a\r\nquestion we have already determined, where he has a right to expect that\r\none shall be decided by his judgment), yet I could not forbear\r\nacquainting him with my resolution at the time I intended to carry it\r\ninto execution. The senate being assembled, I came into the house, and\r\nbegged I might have leave to make a motion; which I did in few words,\r\nand with general assent. When I began to touch upon the charge, and\r\npoint out the person I intended to accuse (though as yet without\r\nmentioning him by name), I was attacked on all sides. \"Let us know,\"\r\nexclaims one, \"who is the subject of this informal motion?\" \"Who is it,\"\r\n(asked another) \"that is thus accused, without acquainting the house\r\nwith his name, and his crime?\" \"Surely,\" (added a third) \"we who have\r\nsurvived the late dangerous times may expect now, at least, to remain in\r\nsecurity.\" I heard all this with perfect calmness, and without being in\r\nthe least alarmed. Such is the effect of conscious integrity; and so\r\nmuch difference is there with respect to inspiring confidence or fear,\r\nwhether the world had only rather one should forbear a certain act, or\r\nabsolutely condemn it. It would be too tedious to relate all that was\r\nadvanced, by different parties, upon this occasion. At length the consul\r\nsaid, \"You will be at liberty, Secundus, to propose what you think\r\nproper when your turn comes to give your opinion upon the order of the\r\nday.\"[143] I replied, \"You must allow me a liberty which you never yet\r\nrefused to any;\" and so sat down: when immediately the house went upon\r\nanother business. In the meanwhile, one of my consular friends took me\r\naside, and, with great earnestness telling me he thought I had carried\r\non this affair with more boldness than prudence, used every method of\r\nreproof and persuasion to prevail with me to desist; adding at the same\r\ntime that I should certainly, if I persevered, render myself obnoxious\r\nto some future prince. \"Be it so,\" I returned, \"should he prove a bad\r\none.\" Scarcely had he left me when a second came up: \"Whatever,\" said\r\nhe, \"are you attempting? Why ever will you ruin yourself? Do you\r\nconsider the risks you expose yourself to? Why will you presume too much\r\non the present situation of public affairs, when it is so uncertain what\r\nturn they may hereafter take? You are attacking a man who is actually at\r\nthe head of the treasury, and will shortly be consul. Besides, recollect\r\nwhat credit he has, and with what powerful friendships he is supported?\"\r\nUpon which he named a certain person, who (not without several strong\r\nand suspicious rumours) was then at the head of a powerful army in the\r\neast. I replied,\r\n\r\n\"'All I've foreseen, and oft in thought revolv'd;[144] and am willing,\r\nif fate shall so decree, to suffer in an honest cause, provided I can\r\ndraw vengeance down upon a most infamous one.\" The time for the members\r\nto give their opinions was now arrived. Domitius Apollinaris, the consul\r\nelect, spoke first; after him Fabricius Vejento, then Fabius Maximinus,\r\nVettius Proculus next (who married my wife's mother, and who was the\r\ncolleague of Publicius Certus, the person on whom the debate turned),\r\nand last of all Ammius Flaccus. They all defended Certus, as if I had\r\nnamed him (though I had not yet so much as once mentioned him), and\r\nentered upon his justification as if I had exhibited a specific charge.\r\nIt is not necessary to repeat in this place what they respectively said,\r\nhaving given it all at length in their words in the speech above-\r\nmentioned. Avidius Quietus and Cornutus Tertullus answered them. The\r\nformer observed, \"that it was extremely unjust not to hear the\r\ncomplaints of those who thought themselves injured, and therefore that\r\nArria and Fannia ought not to be denied the privilege of laying their\r\ngrievances before the house; and that the point for the consideration of\r\nthe senate was not the rank of the person, but the merit of the cause.\"\r\n\r\nThen Cornutus rose up and acquainted the house, \"that, as he was\r\nappointed guardian to the daughter of Helvidius by the consuls, upon the\r\npetition of her mother and her father-in-law, he felt himself compelled\r\nto fulfil the duty of his trust. In the execution of which, however, he\r\nwould endeavour to set some bounds to his indignation by following that\r\ngreat example of moderation which those excellent women[145] had set,\r\nwho contented themselves with barely informing the senate of the\r\ncruelties which Certus committed in order to carry on his infamous\r\nadulation; and therefore,\" he said, \"he would move only that, if a\r\npunishment due to a crime so notoriously known should be remitted,\r\nCertus might at least be branded with some mark of the displeasure of\r\nthat august assembly.\" Satrius Rufus spoke next, and, meaning to steer a\r\nmiddle course, expressed himself with considerable ambiguity. \"I am of\r\nopinion,\" said he, \"that great injustice will be done to Certus if he is\r\nnot acquitted (for I do not scruple to mention his name, since the\r\nfriends of Arria and Fannia, as well as his own, have done so too), nor\r\nindeed have we any occasion for anxiety upon this account. We who think\r\nwell of the man shall judge him with the same impartiality as the rest;\r\nbut if he is innocent, as I hope he is, and shall be glad to find, I\r\nthink this house may very justly deny the present motion till some\r\ncharge has been proved against him.\" Thus, according to the respective\r\norder in which they were called upon, they delivered their several\r\nopinions. When it came to my turn, I rose up, and, using the same\r\nintroduction to my speech as I have published in the defence, I replied\r\nto them severally. It is surprising with what attention, what clamorous\r\napplause I was heard, even by those who just before were loudest against\r\nme: such a wonderful change was wrought either by the importance of the\r\naffair, the successful progress of the speech, or the resolution of the\r\nadvocate. After I had finished, Vejento attempted to reply; but the\r\ngeneral clamour raised against him not permitting him to go on, \"I\r\nentreat you, conscript fathers,\"[146] said he, \"not to oblige me to\r\nimplore the assistance of the tribunes.\"[147] Immediately the tribune\r\nMurena cried out, \"You have my permission, most illustrious Vejento, to\r\ngo on.\" But still the clamour was renewed. In the interval, the consul\r\nordered the house to divide, and having counted the voices, dismissed\r\nthe senate, leaving Vejento in the midst, still attempting to speak. He\r\nmade great complaints of this affront (as he called it), applying the\r\nfollowing lines of Homer to himself:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Great perils, father, wait the unequal fight; Those younger champions\r\nwill thy strength o'ercome.\"<a href=\"#linknote-148\" name=\"linknoteref-\r\n148\" id=\"linknoteref-148\">[148]</a>\r\n\r\nThere was hardly a man in the senate that did not embrace and kiss me,\r\nand all strove who should applaud me most, for having, at the cost of\r\nprivate enmities, revived a custom so long disused, of freely consulting\r\nthe senate upon affairs that concern the honour of the public; in a\r\nword, for having wiped off that reproach which was thrown upon it by\r\nother orders in the state, \"that the senators mutually favoured the\r\nmembers of their own body, while they were very severe in animadverting\r\nupon the rest of their fellow-citizens.\" All this was transacted in the\r\nabsence of Certus; who kept out of the way either because he suspected\r\nsomething of this nature was intended to be moved, or (as was alleged in\r\nhis excuse) that he was really unwell. Cæsar, however, did not refer the\r\nexamination of this matter to the senate. But I succeeded, nevertheless,\r\nin my aim, another person being appointed to succeed Certus in the\r\nconsulship, while the election of his colleague to that office was\r\nconfirmed. And thus, the wish with which I concluded my speech, was\r\nactually accomplished: \"May he be obliged,\" said I, \"to renounce, under\r\na virtuous prince,[149] that reward he received from an infamous\r\none!\"[150] Some time after I recollected, as well as I could, the speech\r\nI had made upon this occasion; to which I made several additions. It\r\nhappened (though indeed it had the appearance of being something more\r\nthan casual) that a few days after I had published this piece, Certus\r\nwas taken ill and died. I was told that his imagination was continually\r\nhaunted with this affair, and kept picturing me ever before his eyes, as\r\na man pursuing him with a drawn sword. Whether there was any truth in\r\nthis rumour, I will not venture to assert; but, for the sake of example,\r\nhowever, I could wish it might gain credit. And now I have sent you a\r\nletter which (considering it is a letter) is as long as the defence you\r\nsay you have read: but you must thank yourself for not being content\r\nwith such information as that piece could afford you. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCII -- To GENITOR\r\n\r\nI HAVE received your letter, in which you complain of having been highly\r\ndisgusted lately at a very splendid entertainment, by a set of buffoons,\r\nmummers, and wanton prostitutes, who were dancing about round the\r\ntables.[151] But let me advise you to smooth your knitted brow somewhat.\r\nI confess, indeed, I admit nothing of this kind at my own house;\r\nhowever, I bear with it in others. \"And why, then,\" you will be ready to\r\nask, \"not have them yourself?\"\r\n\r\nThe truth is, because the gestures of the wanton, the pleasantries of\r\nthe buffoon, or the extravagancies of the mummer, give me no pleasure,\r\nas they give me no surprise. It is my particular taste, you see, not my\r\njudgment, that I plead against them. And indeed, what numbers are there\r\nwho think the entertainments with which you and I are most delighted no\r\nbetter than impertinent follies! How many are there who, as soon as a\r\nreader, a lyrist, or a comedian is introduced, either take their leave\r\nof the company or, if they remain, show as much dislike to this sort of\r\nthing as you did to those monsters, as you call them! Let us bear\r\ntherefore, my friend, with others in their amusements, that they, in\r\nreturn, may show indulgence to ours. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIII -- To SABINIANUS\r\n\r\nYOUR freedman, whom you lately mentioned to me with displeasure, has\r\nbeen with me, and threw himself at my feet with as much submission as he\r\ncould have fallen at yours. He earnestly requested me with many tears,\r\nand even with all the eloquence of silent sorrow, to intercede for him;\r\nin short, he convinced me by his whole behaviour that he sincerely\r\nrepents of his fault. I am persuaded he is thoroughly reformed, because\r\nhe seems deeply sensible of his guilt. I know you are angry with him,\r\nand I know, too, it is not without reason; but clemency can never exert\r\nitself more laudably than when there is the most cause for resentment.\r\nYou once had an affection for this man, and, I hope, will have again;\r\nmeanwhile, let me only prevail with you to pardon him. If he should\r\nincur your displeasure hereafter, you will have so much the stronger\r\nplea in excuse for your anger as you show yourself more merciful to him\r\nnow. Concede something to his youth, to his tears, and to your own\r\nnatural mildness of temper: do not make him uneasy any longer, and I\r\nwill add too, do not make yourself so; for a man of your kindness of\r\nheart cannot be angry without feeling great uneasiness. I am afraid,\r\nwere I to join my entreaties with his, I should seem rather to compel\r\nthan request you to forgive him. Yet I will not scruple even to write\r\nmine with his; and in so much the stronger terms as I have very sharply\r\nand severely reproved him, positively threatening never to interpose\r\nagain in his behalf. But though it was proper to say this to him, in\r\norder to make him more fearful of offending, I do not say so to you. I\r\nmay perhaps, again have occasion to entreat you upon this account, and\r\nagain obtain your forgiveness; supposing, I mean, his fault should be\r\nsuch as may become me to intercede for, and you to pardon. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIV -- To MAXIMUS\r\n\r\nIT has frequently happened, as I have been pleading before the Court of\r\nthe Hundred, that these venerable judges, after having preserved for a\r\nlong period the gravity and solemnity suitable to their character, have\r\nsuddenly, as though urged by irresistible impulse, risen up to a man and\r\napplauded me. I have often likewise gained as much glory in the senate\r\nas my utmost wishes could desire: but I never felt a more sensible\r\npleasure than by an account which I lately received from Cornelius\r\nTacitus. He informed me that, at the last Circensian games, he sat next\r\nto a Roman knight, who, after conversation had passed between them upon\r\nvarious points of learning, asked him, \"Are you an Italian, or a\r\nprovincial?\" Tacitus replied, \"Your acquaintance with literature must\r\nsurely have informed you who I am.\" \"Pray, then, is it Tacitus or Pliny\r\nI am talking with?\" I cannot express how highly I am pleased to find\r\nthat our names are not so much the proper appellatives of men as a kind\r\nof distinction for learning herself; and that eloquence renders us known\r\nto those who would otherwise be ignorant of us. An accident of the same\r\nkind happened to me a few days ago. Fabius Rufinus, a person of\r\ndistinguished merit, was placed next to me at table; and below him a\r\ncountryman of his, who had just then come to Rome for the first time.\r\nRufinus, calling his friend's attention to me, said to him, \"You see\r\nthis man?\" and entered into a conversation upon the subject of my\r\npursuits: to whom the other immediately replied, \"This must undoubtedly\r\nbe Pliny.\" To confess the truth, I look upon these instances as a very\r\nconsiderable recompense of my labours. If Demosthenes had reason to be\r\npleased with the old woman of Athens crying out, \"This is Demosthenes!\"\r\nmay not I, then, be allowed to congratulate myself upon the celebrity my\r\nname has acquired? Yes, my friend, I will rejoice in it, and without\r\nscruple admit that I do. As I only mention the judgment of others, not\r\nmy own, I am not afraid of incurring the censure of vanity; especially\r\nfrom you, who, whilst envying no man's reputation, are particularly\r\nzealous for mine. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCV -- To SABINIANUS\r\n\r\nI GREATLY approve of your having, in compliance with my letter,[152]\r\nreceived again into your favour and family a discarded freedman, who you\r\nonce admitted into a share of your affection. This will afford you, I\r\ndoubt not, great satisfaction. It certainly has me, both as a proof that\r\nyour passion can be controlled, and as an instance of your paying so\r\nmuch regard to me, as either to yield to my authority or to comply with\r\nmy request. Let me, therefore, at once both praise and thank you. At the\r\nsame time I must advise you to be disposed for the future to pardon the\r\nfaults of your people, though there should be none to intercede in their\r\nbehalf. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVI -- To LUPERCUS\r\n\r\nI SAID once (and, I think, not inaptly) of a certain orator of the\r\npresent age, whose compositions are extremely regular and correct, but\r\ndeficient in grandeur and embellishment, \"His only fault is that he has\r\nnone.\" Whereas he, who is possessed of the true spirit of oratory,\r\nshould be bold and elevated, and sometimes even flame out, be hurried\r\naway, and frequently tread upon the brink of a precipice: for danger is\r\ngenerally near whatever is towering and exalted. The plain, it is true,\r\naffords a safer, but for that reason a more humble and inglorious, path:\r\nthey who run are more likely to stumble than they who creep; but the\r\nlatter gain no honour by not slipping, while the former even fall with\r\nglory. It is with eloquence as with some other arts; she is never more\r\npleasing than when she risks most. Have you not observed what\r\nacclamations our rope-dancers excite at the instant of imminent danger?\r\nWhatever is most entirely unexpected, or as the Greeks more strongly\r\nexpress it, whatever is most perilous, most excites our admiration. The\r\npilot's skill is by no means equally proved in a calm as in a storm: in\r\nthe former case he tamely enters the port, unnoticed and unapplauded;\r\nbut when the cordage cracks, the mast bends, and the rudder groans, then\r\nit is that he shines out in all his glory, and is hailed as little\r\ninferior to a sea-god.\r\n\r\nThe reason of my making this observation is, because, if I mistake not,\r\nyou have marked some passages in my writings for being tumid, exuberant,\r\nand over-wrought, which, in my estimation, are but adequate to the\r\nthought, or boldly sublime. But it is material to consider whether your\r\ncriticism turns upon such points as are real faults, or only striking\r\nand remarkable expressions. Whatever is elevated is sure to be observed;\r\nbut it requires a very nice judgment to distinguish the bounds between\r\ntrue and false grandeur; between loftiness and exaggeration. To give an\r\ninstance out of Homer, the author who can, with the greatest propriety,\r\nfly from one extreme of style to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Heav'n in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound; And wide beneath them\r\ngroans the rending ground.\"<a href=\"#linknote-153\" name=\"linknoteref-\r\n153\" id=\"linknoteref-153\">[153]</a>\r\n\r\nAgain,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Reclin'd on clouds his steed and armour lay.\"<a href=\"#linknote-154\"\r\nname=\"linknoteref-154\" id=\"linknoteref-154\">[154]</a>\r\n\r\nSo in this passage:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As torrents roll, increas'd by numerous rills, With rage impetuous down\r\ntheir echoing hills, Rush to the vales, and pour'd along the plain, Roar\r\nthrough a thousand channels to the main.\"\r\n\r\nIt requires, I say, the nicest balance to poise these metaphors, and\r\ndetermine whether they are incredible and meaningless, or majestic and\r\nsublime. Not that I think anything which I have written, or can write,\r\nadmits of comparison with these. I am not quite so foolish; but what I\r\nwould be understood to contend for is, that we should give eloquence\r\nfree rein, and not restrain the force and impetuosity of genius within\r\ntoo narrow a compass. But it will be said, perhaps, that one law applies\r\nto orators, another to poets. As if, in truth, Marc Tully were not as\r\nbold in his metaphors as any of the poets! But not to mention particular\r\ninstances from him, in a point where, I imagine, there can be no\r\ndispute; does Demosthenes[155] himself, that model and standard of true\r\noratory, does Demosthenes check and repress the fire of his indignation,\r\nin that well-known passage which begins thus: \"These wicked men, these\r\nflatterers, and these destroyers of mankind,\" &c. And again: \"It is\r\nneither with stones nor bricks that I have fortified this city,\" &c. --\r\nAnd afterwards: \"I have thrown up these out-works before Attica, and\r\npointed out to you all the resources which human prudence can suggest,\"\r\n&c.--And in another place: \"O Athenians, I swear by the immortal gods\r\nthat he is intoxicated with the grandeur of his own actions,\" &c.[156] -\r\n- But what can be more daring and beautiful than that long digression,\r\nwhich begins in this manner: \"A terrible disease?\" -- The following\r\npassage likewise, though somewhat shorter, is equally boldly conceived:\r\n-- \"Then it was I rose up in opposition to the daring Pytho, who poured\r\nforth a torrent of menaces against you,\" &c.[157] -- The subsequent\r\nstricture is of the same stamp: \"When a man has strengthened himself, as\r\nPhilip has, in avarice and wickedness, the first pretence, the first\r\nfalse step, be it ever so inconsiderable, has overthrown and destroyed\r\nall,\" &c.[158]--So in the same style with the foregoing is this: --\r\n\"Railed off, as it were, from the privileges of society, by the\r\nconcurrent and just judgments of the three tribunals in the city.\" --\r\nAnd in the same place: \"O Aristogiton! you have betrayed that mercy\r\nwhich used to be shown to offences of this nature, or rather, indeed,\r\nyou have wholly destroyed it. In vain then would you fly for refuge to a\r\nport, which you have shut up, and encompassed with rocks.\"--He has said\r\nbefore: \"I am afraid, therefore, you should appear in the judgment of\r\nsome, to have erected a public seminary of faction: for there is a\r\nweakness in all wickedness which renders it apt to betray itself!\" --\r\nAnd a little lower: \"I see none of these resources open to him; but all\r\nis precipice gulf, and profound abyss.\"--And again: \"Nor do I imagine\r\nthat our ancestors erected those courts of judicature that men of his\r\ncharacter should be planted there, but on the contrary', eradicated,\r\nthat none may emulate their evil actions.\"--And afterwards: \"If he is\r\nthen the artificer of every wickedness, if he only makes it his trade\r\nand traffic,\" &c.--And a thousand other passages which I might cite to\r\nthe same purpose; not to mention those expressions which Aeschines calls\r\nnot words, but wonders.--You will tell me, perhaps, I have unwarily\r\nmentioned Aeschines, since Demosthenes is condemned even by him, for\r\nrunning into these figurative expressions. But observe, I entreat you,\r\nhow far superior the former orator is to his critic, and superior too in\r\nthe very passage to which he objects; for in others, the force of his\r\ngenius, in those above quoted, its loftiness, makes itself manifest. But\r\ndoes Aeschines himself avoid those errors which he reproves in\r\nDemosthenes? \"The orator,\" says he, \"Athenians, and the law, ought to\r\nspeak the same language; but when the voice of the law declares one\r\nthing, and that of the orator another we should give our vote to the\r\njustice of the law, not to the impudence of the orator.\"[159]--And in\r\nanother place: \"He afterwards manifestly discovered the design he had,\r\nof concealing his fraud under cover of the decree, having expressly\r\ndeclared therein that the ambassadors sent to the Oretae gave the five\r\ntalents, not to you, but to Callias. And that you may be convinced of\r\nthe truth of what I say (after having stripped the decree of its\r\ngallies, its trim, and its arrogant ostentation) the clause itself.\" --\r\nAnd in another part: \"Suffer him not to break cover and escape out of\r\nthe limits of the question.\" A metaphor he is so fond of that he repeats\r\nit again. \"But remaining firm and confident in the assembly, drive him\r\ninto the merits of the question, and observe well how he doubles.\"--Is\r\nhis style more reserved and simple when he says: \"But you are ever\r\nwounding our ears, and are more concerned in the success of your daily\r\nharangues than for the salvation of the city?\"--What follows is\r\nconceived in a yet higher strain of metaphor: \"Will you not expel this\r\nman as the common calamity of Greece? Will you not seize and punish this\r\npirate of the state, who sails about in quest of favourable\r\nconjunctures,\" &c.--With many other passages of a similar nature. And\r\nnow I expect you will make the same attacks upon certain expressions in\r\nthis letter as you did upon those I have been endeavouring to defend.\r\nThe rudder that groans, and the pilot compared to a sea-god, will not, I\r\nimagine, escape your criticism: for I perceive, while I am suing for\r\nindulgence to my former style, I have fallen into the same kind of\r\nfigurative diction which you condemn. But attack them if you please\r\nprovided you will immediately appoint a day when we may meet to discuss\r\nthese matters in person: you will then either teach me to be less daring\r\nor I shall teach you to be more bold. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVII -- To CANINIUS\r\n\r\nI HAVE met with a story, which, although authenticated by undoubted\r\nevidence, looks very like fable, and would afford a worthy field for the\r\nexercise of so exuberant, lofty, and truly poetical a genius as your\r\nown. It was related to me the other day over the dinner table, where the\r\nconversation happened to run upon various kinds of marvels. The person\r\nwho told the story was a man of unsuspected veracity:--but what has a\r\npoet to do with truth? However, you might venture to rely upon his\r\ntestimony, even though you had the character of a faithful historian to\r\nsupport. There is in Africa a town called Hippo, situated not far from\r\nthe sea-coast: it stands upon a navigable lake, communicating with an\r\nestuary in the form of a river, which alternately flows into the lake,\r\nor into the ocean, according to the ebb and flow of the tide. People of\r\nall ages amuse themselves here with fishing, sailing, or swimming;\r\nespecially boys, whom love of play brings to the spot. With these it is\r\na fine and manly achievement to be able to swim the farthest; and he\r\nthat leaves the shore and his companions at the greatest distance gains\r\nthe victory. It happened, in one of these trials of skill, that a\r\ncertain boy, bolder than the rest, launched out towards the opposite\r\nshore. He was met by a dolphin, who sometimes swam before him, and\r\nsometimes behind him, then played round him, and at last took him upon\r\nhis back, and set him down, and afterwards took him up again; and thus\r\nhe carried the poor frightened fellow out into the deepest part; when\r\nimmediately he turns back again to the shore, and lands him among his\r\ncompanions. The fame of this remarkable accident spread through the\r\ntown, and crowds of people flocked round the boy (whom they viewed as a\r\nkind of prodigy) to ask him questions and hear him relate the story. The\r\nnext day the shore was thronged with spectators, all attentively\r\nwatching the ocean, and (what indeed is almost itself an ocean) the\r\nlake. Meanwhile the boys swam as usual, and among the rest, the boy I am\r\nspeaking of went into the lake, but with more caution than before. The\r\ndolphin appeared again and came to the boy, who, together with his\r\ncompanions, swam away with the utmost precipitation. The dolphin, as\r\nthough to invite and call them back, leaped and dived up and down, in a\r\nseries of circular movements. This he practised the next day, the day\r\nafter, and for several days together, till the people (accustomed from\r\ntheir infancy to the sea) began to be ashamed of their timidity. They\r\nventured, therefore, to advance nearer, playing with him and calling him\r\nto them, while he, in return, suffered himself to be touched and\r\nstroked. Use rendered them courageous. The boy, in particular, who first\r\nmade the experiment, swam by the side of him, and, leaping upon his\r\nback, was carried backwards and forwards in that manner, and thought the\r\ndolphin knew him and was fond of him, while he too had grown fond of the\r\ndolphin. There seemed, now, indeed, to be no fear on either side, the\r\nconfidence of the one and tameness of the other mutually increasing; the\r\nrest of the boys, in the meanwhile, surrounding and encouraging their\r\ncompanion. It is very remarkable that this dolphin was followed by a\r\nsecond, which seemed only as a spectator and attendant on the former;\r\nfor he did not at all submit to the same familiarities as the first, but\r\nonly escorted him backwards and forwards, as the boys did their comrade.\r\nBut what is further surprising, and no less true than what I have\r\nalready related, is that this dolphin, who thus played with the boys and\r\ncarried them upon his back, would come upon the shore, dry himself in\r\nthe sand, and, as soon as he grew warm, roll back into the sea. It is a\r\nfact that Octavius Avitus, deputy governor of the province, actuated by\r\nan absurd piece of superstition, poured some ointment[160] over him as\r\nhe lay on the shore: the novelty and smell of which made him retire into\r\nthe ocean, and it was not till several days after that he was seen\r\nagain, when he appeared dull and languid; however, he recovered his\r\nstrength and continued his usual playful tricks. All the magistrates\r\nround flocked hither to view this sight, whose arrival, and prolonged\r\nstay, was an additional expense, which the slender finances of this\r\nlittle community would ill afford; besides, the quiet and retirement of\r\nthe place was utterly destroyed. It was thought proper, therefore, to\r\nremove the occasion of this concourse, by privately killing the poor\r\ndolphin. And now, with what a flow of tenderness will you describe this\r\naffecting catastrophe![161] and how will your genius adorn and heighten\r\nthis moving story! Though, indeed, the subject does not require any\r\nfictitious embellishments; it will be sufficient to describe the actual\r\nfacts of the case without suppression or diminution. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVIII -- TO FUSCUS\r\n\r\nYou want to know how I portion out my day, in my summer villa at Tuscum?\r\nI get up just when I please; generally about sunrise, often earlier, but\r\nseldom later than this. I keep the shutters closed, as darkness and\r\nsilence wonderfully promote meditation. Thus free and abstracted from\r\nthese outward objects which dissipate attention, I am left to my own\r\nthoughts; nor suffer my mind to wander with my eyes, but keep my eyes in\r\nsubjection to my mind, which, when they are not distracted by a\r\nmultiplicity of external objects, see nothing but what the imagination\r\nrepresents to them. If I have any work in hand, this is the time I\r\nchoose for thinking it out, word for word, even to the minutest accuracy\r\nof expression. In this way I compose more or less, according as the\r\nsubject is more or less difficult, and I find myself able to retain it.\r\nI then call my secretary, and, opening the shutters, dictate to him what\r\nI have put into shape, after which I dismiss him, then call him in\r\nagain, and again dismiss him. About ten or eleven o'clock (for I do not\r\nobserve one fixed hour), according to the weather, I either walk upon my\r\nterrace or in the covered portico, and there I continue to meditate or\r\ndictate what remains upon the subject in which I am engaged. This\r\ncompleted, I get into my chariot, where I employ myself as before, when\r\nI was walking, or in my study; and find this change of scene refreshes\r\nand keeps up my attention. On my return home, I take a little nap, then\r\na walk, and after that repeat out loud and distinctly some Greek or\r\nLatin speech, not so much for the sake of strengthening my voice as my\r\ndigestion;[162] though indeed the voice at the same time is strengthened\r\nby this practice. I then take another walk, am anointed, do my\r\nexercises, and go into the bath. At supper, if I have only my wife or a\r\nfew friends with me, some author is read to us; and after supper we are\r\nentertained either with music or an interlude. When that is finished, I\r\ntake my walk with my family, among whom I am not without some scholars.\r\nThus we pass our evenings in varied conversation; and the day, even when\r\nat the longest, steals imperceptibly away. Upon some occasions I change\r\nthe order in certain of the articles abovementioned. For instance, if I\r\nhave studied longer or walked more than usual, after my second sleep,\r\nand reading a speech or two aloud, instead of using my chariot I get on\r\nhorseback; by which means I ensure as much exercise and lose less time.\r\nThe visits of my friends from the neighbouring villages claim some part\r\nof the day; and sometimes, by an agreeable interruption, they come in\r\nvery seasonably to relieve me when I am feeling tired. I now and then\r\namuse myself with hunting, but always take my tablets into the field,\r\nthat, if I should meet with no game, I may at least bring home\r\nsomething. Part of my time too (though not so much as they desire) is\r\nallotted to my tenants; whose rustic complaints, along with these city\r\noccupations, make my literary studies still more delightful to me.\r\nFarewell. --\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIX -- To PAULINUS\r\n\r\nAs you are not of a disposition to expect from your friends the ordinary\r\nceremonial observances of society when they cannot observe them without\r\ninconvenience to themselves, so I love you too steadfastly to be\r\napprehensive of your taking otherwise than I wish you should my not\r\nwaiting upon you on the first day of your entrance upon the consular\r\noffice, especially as I am detained here by the necessity of letting my\r\nfarms upon long leases. I am obliged to enter upon an entirely new plan\r\nwith my tenants: for under the former leases, though I made them very\r\nconsiderable abatements, they have run greatly in arrear. For this\r\nreason several of them have not only taken no sort of care to lessen a\r\ndebt which they found themselves incapable of wholly discharging, but\r\nhave even seized and consumed all the produce of the land, in the belief\r\nthat it would now be of no advantage to themselves to spare it. I must\r\ntherefore obviate this increasing evil, and endeavour to find out some\r\nremedy against it. The only one I can think of is, not to reserve my\r\nrent in money, but in kind, and so place some of my servants to overlook\r\nthe tillage, and guard the stock; as indeed there is no sort of revenue\r\nmore agreeable to reason than what arises from the bounty of the soil,\r\nthe seasons, and the climate. It is true, this method will require great\r\nhonesty, sharp eyes, and many hands. However, I must risk the\r\nexperiment, and, as in an inveterate complaint, try every change of\r\nremedy. You see, it is not any pleasurable indulgence that prevents my\r\nattending you on the first day of your consulship. I shall celebrate it\r\nnevertheless, as much as if I were present, and pay my vows for you\r\nhere, with all the warmest tokens of joy and congratulation. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCX -- To FUSCUS\r\n\r\nYou are much pleased, I find, with the account I gave you in my former\r\nletter of how I spend the summer season at Tuscum, and desire to know\r\nwhat alteration I make in my method when I am at Laurentum in the\r\nwinter. None at all, except abridging myself of my sleep at noon, and\r\nborrowing a good piece of the night before daybreak and after sunset for\r\nstudy: and if business is very urgent (which in winter very frequently\r\nhappens), instead of having interludes or music after supper, I\r\nreconsider whatever I have previously dictated, and improve my memory at\r\nthe same time by this frequent mental revision. Thus I have given you a\r\ngeneral sketch of my mode of life in summer and winter; to which you may\r\nadd the intermediate seasons of spring and autumn, in which, while\r\nlosing nothing out of the day, I gain but little from the night.\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES TO THE LETTERS OF PLINY] 1 (return) [ A pupil and intimate\r\nfriend of Paetus Thrasea, the distinguished Stoic philosopher.

But the\r\nimmortal gods thought proper to hasten the advancement of those virtues\r\nto the helm of the commonwealth which had already shared in the\r\nsteerage.[1002] May you then, and the world through your means, enjoy\r\nevery prosperity worthy of your reign: to which let me add my wishes,\r\nmost excellent Emperor, upon a private as well as public account, that\r\nyour health and spirits may be preserved firm and unbroken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nYou have occasioned me, Sir, an inexpressible pleasure in deeming me\r\nworthy of enjoying the privilege which the laws confer on those who have\r\nthree children. For although it was from an indulgence to the request of\r\nthe excellent Julius Servianus, your own most devoted servant, that you\r\ngranted this favour, yet I have the satisfaction to find by the words of\r\nyour rescript that you complied the more willingly as his application\r\nwas in my behalf. I cannot but look upon myself as in possession of my\r\nutmost wish, after having thus received, at the beginning of your most\r\nauspicious reign, so distinguishing a mark of your peculiar favour; at\r\nthe same time that it considerably heightens my desire of leaving a\r\nfamily behind me. I was not entirely without this desire even in the\r\nlate most unhappy times: as my two marriages will induce you to believe.\r\nBut the gods decreed it better, by reserving every valuable privilege to\r\nthe bounty of your generous dispensations. And indeed the pleasure of\r\nbeing a father will be so much more acceptable to me now, that I can\r\nenjoy it in full security and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nTHE experience, most excellent Emperor, I have had of your unbounded\r\ngenerosity to me, in my own person, encourages me to hope I may be yet\r\nfarther obliged to it, in that of my friends. Voconius Romanus (who was\r\nmy schoolfellow and companion from our earliest years) claims the first\r\nrank in that number; in consequence of which I petitioned your sacred\r\nfather to promote him to the dignity of the senatorial order. But the\r\ncompletion of my request is reserved to your goodness; for his mother\r\nhad not then advanced, in the manner the law directs, the liberal\r\ngift[1003] of four hundred thousand sesterces, which she engaged to give\r\nhim, in her letter to the late emperor, your father. This, however, by\r\nmy advice she has since done, having made over certain estates to him,\r\nas well as completed every other act necessary to make the conveyance\r\nvalid. The difficulties therefore being removed which deferred the\r\ngratification of our wishes, it is with full confidence I venture to\r\nassure you of the worth of my friend Romanus, heightened and adorned as\r\nit is not only by liberal culture, but by his extraordinary tenderness\r\nto his parents as well. It is to that virtue he owes the present\r\nliberality of his mother; as well as his immediate succession to his\r\nlate father's estate, and his adoption by his father-in-law. To these\r\npersonal qualifications, the wealth and rank of his family give\r\nadditional lustre; and I persuade myself it will be some further\r\nrecommendation that I solicit in his behalf. Let me, then, entreat you,\r\nSir, to enable me to congratulate Romanus on so desirable an occasion,\r\nand at the same time to indulge an eager and, I hope, laudable ambition,\r\nof having it in my power to boast that your favourable regards are\r\nextended not only to myself, but also to my friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nWHEN by your gracious indulgence, Sir, I was appointed to preside at the\r\ntreasury of Saturn, I immediately renounced all engagements of the bar\r\n(as indeed I never blended business of that kind with the functions of\r\nthe state), that no avocations might call off my attention from the post\r\nto which I was appointed. For this reason, when the province of Africa\r\npetitioned the senate that I might undertake their cause against Marius\r\nPriscus, I excused myself from that office; and my excuse was allowed.\r\nBut when afterwards the consul elect proposed that the senate should\r\napply to us again, and endeavour to prevail with us to yield to its\r\ninclinations, and suffer our names to be thrown into the urn, I thought\r\nit most agreeable to that tranquillity and good order which so happily\r\ndistinguishes your times not to oppose (especially in so reasonable an\r\ninstance) the will of that august assembly. And, as I am desirous that\r\nall my words and actions may receive the sanction of your exemplary\r\nvirtue, I hope you approve of my compliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nYou acted as became a good citizen and a worthy senator, by paying\r\nobedience to the just requisition of that august assembly: and I have\r\nfull confidence you will faithfully discharge the business you have\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nHAVING been attacked last year by a very severe and dangerous illness, I\r\nemployed a physician, whose care and diligence, Sir, I cannot\r\nsufficiently reward, but by your gracious assistance. I entreat you\r\ntherefore to make him a denizen of Rome; for as he is the freedman of a\r\nforeign lady, he is, consequently, himself also a foreigner. His name is\r\nHarpocras; his patroness (who has been dead a considerable time) was\r\nThermuthis, the daughter of Theon. I further entreat you to bestow the\r\nfull privileges of a Roman citizen upon Hedia and Antonia Harmeris, the\r\nfreedwomen of Antonia Maximilla, a lady of great merit. It is at her\r\ndesire I make this request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nI RETURN YOU thanks, Sir, for your ready compliance with my desire, in\r\ngranting the complete privileges of a Roman to the freedwomen of a lady\r\nto whom I am allied and also for making Harpocras, my physician, a\r\ndenizen of Rome. But when, agreeably to your directions, I gave in an\r\naccount of his age, and estate, I was informed by those who are better\r\nskilled in the affairs than I pretend to be that, as he is an Egyptian,\r\nI ought first to have obtained for him the freedom of Alexandria before\r\nhe was made free of Rome. I confess, indeed, as I was ignorant of any\r\ndifference in this case between those of Egypt and other countries, I\r\ncontented myself with only acquainting you that he had been manumitted\r\nby a foreign lady long since deceased. However, it is an ignorance I\r\ncannot regret, since it affords me an opportunity of receiving from you\r\na double obligation in favour of the same person. That I may legally\r\ntherefore enjoy the benefit of your goodness, I beg you would be pleased\r\nto grant him the freedom of the city of Alexandria, as well as that of\r\nRome. And that your gracious intentions may not meet with any further\r\nobstacles, I have taken care, as you directed, to send an account to\r\nyour freedman of his age and possessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nIT is my resolution, in pursuance of the maxim observed by the princes\r\nmy predecessors, to be extremely cautious in granting the freedom of the\r\ncity of Alexandria: however, since you have obtained of me the freedom\r\nof Rome for your physician Harpocras, I cannot refuse you this other\r\nrequest. You must let me know to what district he belongs, that I may\r\ngive you a letter to my friend Pompeius Planta, governor of Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nI CANNOT express, Sir, the pleasure your letter gave me, by which I am\r\ninformed that you have made my physician Harpocras a denizen of\r\nAlexandria; notwithstanding your resolution to follow the maxim of your\r\npredecessors in this point, by being extremely cautious in granting that\r\nprivilege. Agreeably to your directions, I acquaint you that Harpocras\r\nbelongs to the district of Memphis.[1004] I entreat you then, most\r\ngracious Emperor, to send me, as you promised, a letter to your friend\r\nPompeius Planta, governor of Egypt. As I purpose (in order to have the\r\nearliest enjoyment of your presence, so ardently wished for here) to\r\ncome to meet you, I beg, Sir, you would permit me to extend my journey\r\nas far as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nI WAS greatly obliged, Sir, in my late illness, to Posthumius Marinus,\r\nmy physician; and I cannot make him a suitable return, but by the\r\nassistance of your wonted gracious indulgence. I entreat you then to\r\nmake Chrysippus Mithridates and his wife Stratonica (who are related to\r\nMarinus) denizens of Rome. I entreat likewise the same privilege in\r\nfavour of Epigonus and Mithridates, the two sons of Chrysippus; but with\r\nthis restriction [1005] that they may remain under the dominion of their\r\nfather, and yet reserve their right of patronage over their own\r\nfreedmen. I further entreat you to grant the full privileges of a Roman\r\nto L. Satrius Abascantius, P. Caesius Phosphorus, and Pancharia Soteris.\r\nThis request I make with the consent of their patrons.[1005]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nAFTER your late sacred father, Sir, had, in a noble speech, as well as\r\nby his own generous example, exhorted and encouraged the public to acts\r\nof munificence, I implored his permission to remove the several statues\r\nwhich I had of the former emperors to my corporation, and at the same\r\ntime requested permission to add his own to the number. For as I had\r\nhitherto let them remain in the respective places in which they stood\r\nwhen they were left to me by several different inheritances, they were\r\ndispersed in distant parts of my estate. He was pleased to grant my\r\nrequest, and at the same time to give me a very ample testimony of his\r\napprobation. I immediately, therefore, wrote to the decurii, to desire\r\nthey would allot a piece of ground, upon which I might build a temple at\r\nmy own expense; and they, as a mark of honour to my design, offered me\r\nthe choice of any site I might think proper. However, my own ill-health\r\nin the first place, and later that of your father, together with the\r\nduties of that employment which you were both pleased to entrust me,\r\nprevented my proceeding with that design. But I have now, I think, a\r\nconvenient opportunity of making an excursion for the purpose, as my\r\nmonthly attendances ends on the 1st of September, and there are several\r\nfestivals in the month following. My first request, then, is that you\r\nwould permit me to adorn the temple I am going to erect with your\r\nstatue, and next (in order to the execution of my design with all the\r\nexpedition possible) that you would indulge me with leave of absence. It\r\nwould ill become the sincerity I profess, were I to dissemble that your\r\ngoodness in complying with this desire will at the same time be\r\nextremely serviceable to me in my own private affairs. It is absolutely\r\nnecessary I should not defer any longer the letting of my lands in that\r\nprovince; for, besides that they amount to above four hundred thousand\r\nsesterces,[1006] the time for dressing the vineyards is approaching, and\r\nthat business must fall upon my new tenants.[1007] The unfruitfulness of\r\nthe seasons besides, for several years past, obliges me to think of\r\nmaking some abatements in my rents; which I cannot possibly settle\r\nunless I am present. I shall be indebted then to your indulgence, Sir,\r\nfor the expedition of my work of piety, and the settlement of my own\r\nprivate affairs, if you will be pleased to grant me leave of\r\nabsence[1008] for thirty days. I cannot give myself a shorter time, as\r\nthe town and the estate of which I am speaking lie above a hundred and\r\nfifty miles from Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nYou have given me many private reasons, and every public one, why you\r\ndesire leave of absence; but I need no other than that it is your\r\ndesire: and I doubt not of your returning as soon as possible to the\r\nduty of an office which so much requires your attendance. As I would not\r\nseem to check any instance of your affection towards me, I shall not\r\noppose your erecting my statue in the place you desire; though in\r\ngeneral I am extremely cautious in giving any encouragement to honours\r\nof that kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\n[1009] As I am sensible, Sir, that the highest applause my actions can\r\nreceive is to be distinguished by so excellent a prince, I beg you would\r\nbe graciously pleased to add either the office of augur or septemvir [1009]\r\n(both which are now vacant) to the dignity I already enjoy by your\r\nindulgence; that I may have the satisfaction of publicly offering up\r\nthose vows for your prosperity, from the duty of my office, which I\r\ndaily prefer to the gods in private, from the affection of my heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nHAVING safely passed the promontory of Malea, I am arrived at Ephesus\r\nwith all my retinue, notwithstanding I was detained for some time by\r\ncontrary winds: a piece of information, Sir, in which, I trust, you will\r\nfeel yourself concerned. I propose pursuing the remainder of my journey\r\nto the province[1010] partly in light vessels, and partly in post-\r\nchaises: for as the excessive heats will prevent my travelling\r\naltogether by land, so the Etesian winds,[1011] which are now set in,\r\nwill not permit me to proceed entirely by sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nYOUR information, my dear Pliny, was extremely agreeable to mc, as it\r\ndoes concern me to know in what manner you arrive at your province. It\r\nis a wise intention of yours to travel either by sea or land, as you\r\nshall find most convenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nAs I had a very favourable voyage to Ephesus, so in travelling by post-\r\nchaise from thence I was extremely troubled by the heats, and also by\r\nsome slight feverish attacks, which kept me some time at Pergamus. From\r\nthere, Sir, I got on board a coasting vessel, but, being again detained\r\nby contrary winds, did not arrive at Bithynia so soon as I had hoped.\r\nHowever, I have no reason to complain of this delay, since (which indeed\r\nwas the most auspicious circumstance that could attend me) I reached the\r\nprovince in time to celebrate your birthday. I am at present engaged in\r\nexamining the finances of the Prusenses,[1012] their expenses, revenues,\r\nand credits; and the farther I proceed in this work, the more I am\r\nconvinced of the necessity of my enquiry. Several large sums of money\r\nare owing to the city from private persons, which they neglect to pay\r\nupon various pretences; as, on the other hand, I find the public funds\r\nare, in some instances, very unwarrantably applied. This, Sir, I write\r\nto you immediately on my arrival. I entered this province on the 17th of\r\nSeptember,[1013] and found in it that obedience and loyalty towards\r\nyourself which you justly merit from all mankind. You will consider,\r\nSir, whether it would not be proper to send a surveyor here; for I am\r\ninclined to think much might be deducted from what is charged by those\r\nwho have the conduct of the public works if a faithful admeasurement\r\nwere to be taken: at least I am of that opinion from what I have already\r\nseen of the accounts of this city, which I am now going into as fully as\r\nis possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nI SHOULD have rejoiced to have heard that you arrived at Bithynia\r\nwithout the smallest inconvenience to yourself or any of your retinue,\r\nand that your journey from Ephesus had been as easy as your voyage to\r\nthat place was favourable. For the rest, your letter informs me, my\r\ndearest Secundus, on what day you reached Bithynia. The people of that\r\nprovince will be convinced, I persuade myself, that I am attentive to\r\ntheir interest: as your conduct towards them will make it manifest that\r\nI could have chosen no more proper person to supply my place. The\r\nexamination of the public accounts ought certainly to be your first\r\nemployment, as they are evidently in great disorder. I have scarcely\r\nsurveyors sufficient to inspect those works[1014] which I am carrying on\r\nat Rome, and in the neighbourhood; but persons of integrity and skill in\r\nthis art may be found, most certainly, in every province, so that they\r\nwill not fail you if only you will make due enquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nTHOUGH I am well assured, Sir, that you, who never omit any opportunity\r\nof exerting your generosity, are not unmindful of the request I lately\r\nmade to you, yet, as you have often indulged me in this manner, give me\r\nleave to remind and earnestly entreat you to bestow the praetorship now\r\nvacant upon Attius Sura. Though his ambition is extremely moderate, yet\r\nthe quality of his birth, the inflexible integrity he has preserved in a\r\nvery narrow fortune, and, more than all, the felicity of your times,\r\nwhich encourages conscious virtue to claim your favour, induce him to\r\nhope he may experience it in the present instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nI CONGRATULATE both you and the public, most excellent Emperor, upon the\r\ngreat and glorious victory you have obtained; so agreeable to the\r\nheroism of ancient Rome. May the immortal gods grant the same happy\r\nsuccess to all your designs, that, under the administration of so many\r\nprincely virtues, the splendour of the empire may shine out, not only in\r\nits former, but with additional lustre.[1015]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nMv lieutenant, Servilius Pudens, came to Nicomedia,[1016] Sir, on the\r\n24th of November, and by his arrival freed me, at length, from the\r\nanxiety of a very uneasy expectation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nYOUR generosity to me, Sir, was the occasion of uniting me to Rosianus\r\nGeminus, by the strongest ties; for he was my quaestor when I was\r\nconsul. His behaviour to me during the continuance of our offices was\r\nhighly respectful, and he has treated me ever since with so peculiar a\r\nregard that, besides the many obligations I owe him upon a public\r\naccount, I am indebted to him for the strongest pledges of private\r\nfriendship. I entreat you, then, to comply with my request for the\r\nadvancement of one whom (if my recommendation has any weight) you will\r\neven distinguish with your particular favour; and whatever trust you\r\nshall repose in him, he will endeavour to show himself still deserving\r\nof an higher. But I am the more sparing in my praises of him, being\r\npersuaded his integrity, his probity, and his vigilance are well known\r\nto you, not only from those high posts which he has exercised in Rome\r\nwithin your immediate inspection, but from his behaviour when he served\r\nunder you in the army. One thing, however, my affection for him inclines\r\nme to think, I have not yet sufficiently done; and therefore, Sir, I\r\nrepeat my entreaties that you will give me the pleasure, as early as\r\npossible, of rejoicing in the advancement of my quaestor, or, in other\r\nwords, of receiving an addition to my own honours, in the person of my\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nIT is not easy, Sir, to express the joy I received when I heard you had,\r\nin compliance with the request of my mother-in-law and myself, granted\r\nCoelius Clemens the proconsulship of this province after the expiration\r\nof his consular office; as it is from thence I learn the full extent of\r\nyour goodness towards me, which thus graciously extends itself through\r\nmy whole family. As I dare not pretend to make an equal return to those\r\nobligations I so justly owe you, I can only have recourse to vows, and\r\nardently implore the gods that I may not be found unworthy of those\r\nfavours which you are repeatedly conferring upon me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nI RECEIVED, Sir, a dispatch from your freedman, Lycormas, desiring me,\r\nif any embassy from Bosporus[1017] should come here on the way to Rome,\r\nthat I would detain it till his arrival. None has yet arrived, at least\r\nin the city[1018] where I now am. But a courier passing through this\r\nplace from the king of Sarmatia,[1019] I embrace the opportunity which\r\naccidentally offers itself, of sending with him the messenger which\r\nLycormas despatched hither, that you might be informed by both their\r\nletters of what, perhaps, it may be expedient you should be acquainted\r\nwith at one and the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nI AM informed by a letter from the king of Sarmatia that there are\r\ncertain affairs of which you ought to be informed as soon as possible.\r\nIn order, therefore, to hasten the despatches which his courier was\r\ncharged with to you, I granted him an order to make use of the public\r\npost.[1020]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nTHE ambassador from the king of Sarmatia having remained two days, by\r\nhis own choice, at Nicea, I did not think it reasonable, Sir, to detain\r\nhim any longer: because, in the first place, it was still uncertain when\r\nyour freedman, Lycormas, would arrive, and then again some indispensable\r\naffairs require my presence in a different part of the province. Of this\r\nI thought it necessary that you should be informed, because I lately\r\nacquainted you in a letter that Lycormas had desired, if any embassy\r\nshould come this way from Bosporus, that I would detain it till his\r\narrival. But I saw no plausible pretext for keeping him back any longer,\r\nespecially as the despatches from Lycormas, which (as I mentioned\r\nbefore) I was not willing to detain, would probably reach you some days\r\nsooner than this ambassador.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nI RECEIVED a letter, Sir, from Apuleius, a military man, belonging to\r\nthe garrison at Nicomedia, informing me that one Callidromus, being\r\narrested by Maximus and Dionysius (two bakers, to whom he had hired\r\nhimself), fled for refuge to your statue;[1021] that, being brought\r\nbefore a magistrate, he declared he, was formerly slave to Laberius\r\nMaximus, but being taken prisoner by Susagus[1022] in Moesia,[1023] he\r\nwas sent as a present from Decebalus to Pacorus, king of Parthia, in\r\nwhose service he continued several years, from whence he made his\r\nescape, and came to Nicomedia. When he was examined before me, he\r\nconfirmed this account, for which reason I thought it necessary to\r\nsend[1024] him to you. This I should have done sooner, but I delayed his\r\njourney in order to make an inquiry concerning a seal ring which he said\r\nwas taken from him, upon which was engraven the figure of Pacorus in his\r\nroyal robes; I was desirous (if it could have been found) of\r\ntransmitting this curiosity to you, with a small gold nugget which he\r\nsays he brought from out of the Parthian mines. I have affixed my seal\r\nto it, the impression of which is a chariot drawn by four horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nYOUR freedman and procurator,[1025] Maximus, behaved, Sir, during all\r\nthe time we were together, with great probity, attention, and diligence;\r\nas one strongly attached to your interest, and strictly observant of\r\ndiscipline. This testimony I willingly give him; and I give it with all\r\nthe fidelity I owe you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nAFTER having experienced, Sir, in Gabius Bassus, who commands on the\r\nPontic[1026] coast, the greatest integrity, honour, and diligence, as\r\nwell as the most particular respect to myself, I cannot refuse him my\r\nbest wishes and suffrage; and I give them to him with all that fidelity\r\nwhich is due to you. I have found him abundantly qualified by having\r\nserved in the army under you; and it is owing to the advantages of your\r\ndiscipline that he has learned to merit your favour. The soldiery and\r\nthe people here, who have had full experience of his justice and\r\nhumanity, rival each other in that glorious testimony they give of his\r\nconduct, both in public and in private; and I certify this with all the\r\nsincerity you have a right to expect from me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nNYMPHIDIUS Lupus,[1027] Sir, and myself, served in the army together; he\r\ncommanded a body of the auxiliary forces at the same time that I was\r\nmilitary tribune; and it was from thence my affection for him began. A\r\nlong acquaintance has since mutually endeared and strengthened our\r\nfriendship. For this reason I did violence to his repose, and insisted\r\nupon his attending me into Bithynia, as my assessor in council. He most\r\nreadily granted me this proof of his friendship; and without any regard\r\nto the plea of age, or the ease of retirement, he shared, and continues\r\nto share, with me, the fatigue of public business. I consider his\r\nrelations, therefore, as my own; in which number Nymphidius Lupus, his\r\nson, claims my particular regard. He is a youth of great merit and\r\nindefatigable application, and in every respect well worthy of so\r\nexcellent a father. The early proof he gave of his merit, when he\r\ncommanded a regiment of foot, shows him to be equal to any honour you\r\nmay think proper to confer upon him; and it gained him the strongest\r\ntestimony of approbation from those most illustrious personages, Julius\r\nFerox and Fuscus Salinator. And I will add, Sir, that I shall rejoice in\r\nany accession of dignity which he shall receive as an occasion of\r\nparticular satisfaction to myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nI BEG your determination, Sir, on a point I am exceedingly doubtful\r\nabout: it is whether I should place the public slaves[1028] as sentries\r\nround the prisons of the several cities in this province (as has been\r\nhitherto the practice) or employ a party of soldiers for that purpose?\r\nOn the one hand, I am afraid the public slaves will not attend this duty\r\nwith the fidelity they ought; and on the other, that it will engage too\r\nlarge a body of the soldiery. In the meanwhile I have joined a few of\r\nthe latter with the former. I am apprehensive, however, there may be\r\nsome danger that this method will occasion a general neglect of duty, as\r\nit will afford them a mutual opportunity of throwing the blame upon each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nTHERE is no occasion, my dearest Secundus, to draw off any soldiers in\r\norder to guard the prisons. Let us rather persevere in the ancient\r\ncustoms observed in this province, of employing the public slaves for\r\nthat purpose; and the fidelity with which they shall execute their duty\r\nwill depend much upon your care and strict discipline. It is greatly to\r\nbe feared, as you observe, if the soldiers should be mixed with the\r\npublic slaves, they will mutually trust to each other, and by that means\r\ngrow so much the more negligent. But my principal objection is that as\r\nfew soldiers as possible should be withdrawn from their standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nGABIUS BASSUS, who commands upon the frontiers of Pontica, in a manner\r\nsuitable to the respect and duty which he owes you, came to me, and has\r\nbeen with me, Sir, for several days. As far as I could observe, he is a\r\nperson of great merit and worthy of your favour. I acquainted him it was\r\nyour order that he should retain only ten beneficiary[1029] soldiers,\r\ntwo horse-guards, and one centurion out of the troops which you were\r\npleased to assign to my command. He assured me those would not be\r\nsufficient, and that he would write to you accordingly; for which reason\r\nI thought it proper not immediately to recall his supernumeraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nI HAVE received from Gabius Bassus the letter you mention, acquainting\r\nme that the number of soldiers I had ordered him was not sufficient; and\r\nfor your information I have directed my answer to be hereunto annexed.\r\nIt is very material to distinguish between what the exigency of affairs\r\nrequires and what an ambitious desire of extending power may think\r\nnecessary. As for ourselves, the public welfare must be our only guide:\r\naccordingly it is incumbent upon us to take all possible care that the\r\nsoldiers shall not be absent from their standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nTHE PRUSENSES, Sir, having an ancient bath which lies in a ruinous\r\nstate, desire your leave to repair it; but, upon examination, I am of\r\nopinion it ought to be rebuilt. I think, therefore, you may indulge them\r\nin this request, as there will be a sufficient fund for that purpose,\r\npartly from those debts which are due from private persons to the public\r\nwhich I am now collecting in; and partly from what they raise among\r\nthemselves towards furnishing the bath with oil, which they are willing\r\nto apply to the carrying on of this building; a work which the dignity\r\nof the city and the splendour of your times seem to demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nIF the erecting a public bath will not be too great a charge upon the\r\nPrusenses, we may comply with their request; provided, however, that no\r\nnew tax be levied for this purpose, nor any of those taken off which are\r\nappropriated to necessary services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nI AM assured, Sir, by your freedman and receiver-general Maximus, that\r\nit is necessary he should have a party of soldiers assigned to him, over\r\nand besides the beneficiarii, which by your orders I allotted to the\r\nvery worthy Gemellinus. Those therefore which I found in his service, I\r\nthought proper he should retain, especially as he was going into\r\nPaphlagonia,[1030] in order to procure corn. For his better protection\r\nlikewise, and because it was his request, I added two of the cavalry.\r\nBut I beg you would inform me, in your next despatches, what method you\r\nwould have me observe for the future in points of this nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX VII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nAs my freedman Maximus was going upon an extraordinary commission to\r\nprocure corn, I approve of your having supplied him with a file of\r\nsoldiers. But when he shall return to the duties of his former post, I\r\nthink two from you and as many from his coadjutor, my receiver-general\r\nVirdius Gemelhinus, will be sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nTHE very excellent young man Sempronius Caelianus, having discovered two\r\nslaves[1031] among the recruits, has sent them to me. But I deferred\r\npassing sentence till I had consulted you, the restorer and upholder of\r\nmilitary discipline, concerning the punishment proper to be inflicted\r\nupon them. My principal doubt is that, whether, although they have taken\r\nthe military oath, they are yet entered into any particular legion. I\r\nrequest you therefore, Sir, to inform me what course I should pursue in\r\nthis affair, especially as it concerns example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nSEMPRONIUS CAELINUS has acted agreeably to my orders, in sending such\r\npersons to be tried before you as appear to deserve capital punishment.\r\nIt is material however, in the case in question, to inquire whether\r\nthese slaves in-listed themselves voluntarily, or were chosen by the\r\nofficers, or presented as substitutes for others. If they were chosen,\r\nthe officer is guilty; if they are substitutes, the blame rests with\r\nthose who deputed them; but if, conscious of the legal inabilities of\r\ntheir station, they presented themselves voluntarily, the punishment\r\nmust fall upon their own heads. That they are not yet entered into any\r\nlegion, makes no great difference in their case; for they ought to have\r\ngiven a true account of themselves immediately, upon their being\r\napproved as fit for the service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nAs I have your permission, Sir, to address myself to you in all my\r\ndoubts, you will not consider it beneath your dignity to descend to\r\nthose humbler affairs which concern my administration of this province.\r\nI find there are in several cities, particularly those of Nicomedia and\r\nNicea, certain persons who take upon themselves to act as public slaves,\r\nand receive an annual stipend accordingly; notwithstanding they have\r\nbeen condemned either to the mines, the public games,[1032] or other\r\npunishments of the like nature. Having received information of this\r\nabuse I have been long debating with myself what I ought to do. On the\r\none hand, to send them back again to their respective punishments (many\r\nof them being now grown old, and behaving, as I am assured, with\r\nsobriety and modesty) would, I thought, be proceeding against them too\r\nseverely; on the other, to retain convicted criminals in the public\r\nservice, seemed not altogether decent. I considered at the same time to\r\nsupport these people in idleness would be an useless expense to the\r\npublic; and to leave them to starve would be dangerous. I was obliged\r\ntherefore to suspend the determination of this matter till I could\r\nconsult with you. You will be desirous, perhaps, to be informed how it\r\nhappened that these persons escaped the punishments to which they were\r\ncondemned. This enquiry I have also made, but cannot return you any\r\nsatisfactory answer. The decrees against them were indeed produced; but\r\nno record appears of their having ever been reversed. It was asserted,\r\nhowever, that these people were pardoned upon their petition to the\r\nproconsuls, or their lieutenants; which seems likely to be the truth, as\r\nit is improbable any person would have dared to set them at liberty\r\nwithout authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nYou will remember you were sent into Bithynia for the particular purpose\r\nof correcting those many abuses which appeared in need of reform. Now\r\nnone stands more so than that of criminals who have been sentenced to\r\npunishment should not only be set at liberty (as your letter informs me)\r\nwithout authority; but even appointed to employments which ought only to\r\nbe exercised by persons whose characters are irreproachable. Those\r\ntherefore among them who have been convicted within these ten years, and\r\nwhose sentence has not been reversed by proper authority, must be sent\r\nback again to their respective punishments: but where more than ten\r\nyears have elapsed since their conviction, and they are grown old and\r\ninfirm, let them he disposed of in such employments as are but few\r\ndegrees removed from the punishments to which they were sentenced; that\r\nis, either to attend upon the public baths, cleanse the common sewers,\r\nor repair the streets and highways, the usual offices assigned to such\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nWHILE I was making a progress in a different part of the province, a\r\nmost extensive fire broke out at Nicomedia, which not only consumed\r\nseveral private houses, but also two public buildings; the town-house\r\nand the temple of Isis, though they stood on contrary sides of the\r\nstreet. The occasion of its spreading thus far was partly owing to the\r\nviolence of the wind, and partly to the indolence of the people, who,\r\nmanifestly, stood idle and motionless spectators of this terrible\r\ncalamity. The truth is the city was not furnished with either engines,\r\n[1033]buckets, or any single instrument suitable for extinguishing\r\nfires; which I have now however given directions to have prepared. You\r\nwill consider, Sir, whether it may not be advisable to institute a\r\ncompany of fire-men, consisting only of one hundred and fifty members. I\r\nwill take care none but those of that business shall be admitted into\r\nit, and that the privileges granted them shall not be applied to any\r\nother purpose. As this corporate body will be restricted to so small a\r\nnumber of members, it will be easy to keep them under proper regulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nYou are of opinion it would be proper to establish a company of firemen\r\nin Nicomedia, agreeably to what has been practised in several other\r\ncities. But it is to be remembered that societies of this sort have\r\ngreatly disturbed the peace of the province in general, and of those\r\ncities in particular. Whatever name we give them, and for whatever\r\npurposes they may be founded, they will not fail to form themselves into\r\nfactious assemblies, however short their meetings may be. It will\r\ntherefore be safer to provide such machines as are of service in\r\nextinguishing fires, enjoining the owners of houses to assist in\r\npreventing the mischief from spreading, and, if it should be necessary,\r\nto call in the aid of the populace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nWE have acquitted, Sir, and renewed our annual vows[1034] for your\r\nprosperity, in which that of the empire is essentially involved,\r\nimploring the gods to grant us ever thus to pay and thus to repeat them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nI RECEIVED the satisfaction, my dearest Secundus, of being informed by\r\nyour letter that you, together with the people under your government,\r\nhave both discharged and renewed your vows to the immortal gods for my\r\nhealth and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVI -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nTHE citizens of Nicomedia, Sir, have expended three millions three\r\nhundred and twenty-nine sesterces[1035] in building an aqueduct; but,\r\nnot being able to finish it, the works are entirely falling to ruin.\r\nThey made a second attempt in another place, where they laid out two\r\nmillions.[1036] But this likewise is discontinued; so that, after having\r\nbeen at an immense charge to no purpose, they must still be at a further\r\nexpense, in order to be accommodated with water. I have examined a fine\r\nspring from whence the water may be conveyed over arches (as was\r\nattempted in their first design) in such a manner that the higher as\r\nwell as level and low parts of the city may be supplied. There are still\r\nremaining a very few of the old arches; and the square stones, however,\r\nemployed in the former building, may be used in turning the new arches.\r\nI am of opinion part should be raised with brick, as that will be the\r\neasier and cheaper material. But that this work may not meet with the\r\nsame ill-success as the former, it will be necessary to send here an\r\narchitect, or some one skilled in the construction of this kind of\r\nwaterworks. And I will venture to say, from the beauty and usefulness of\r\nthe design, it will be an erection well worthy the splendour of your\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nCARE must be taken to supply the city of Nicomedia with water; and that\r\nbusiness, I am well persuaded, you will perform with all the diligence\r\nyou ought. But really it is no less incumbent upon you to examine by\r\nwhose misconduct it has happened that such large sums have been thrown\r\naway upon this, lest they apply the money to private purposes, and the\r\naqueduct in question, like the preceding, should be begun, and\r\nafterwards left unfinished. You will let me know the result of your\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nTHE citizens of Nicea, Sir; are building a theatre, which, though it is\r\nnot yet finished, has already exhausted, as I am informed (for I have\r\nnot examined the account myself), above ten millions of sesterces;[1037]\r\nand, what is worse, I fear to no purpose. For either from the foundation\r\nbeing laid in soft, marshy ground, or that the stone itself is light and\r\ncrumbling, the walls are sinking, and cracked from top to bottom. It\r\ndeserves your consideration, therefore, whether it would be best to\r\ncarry on this work, or entirely discontinue it, or rather, perhaps,\r\nwhether it would not be most prudent absolutely to destroy it: for the\r\nbuttresses and foundations by means of which it is from time to time\r\nkept up appear to me more expensive than solid. Several private persons\r\nhave undertaken to build the compartment of this theatre at their own\r\nexpense, some engaging to erect the portico, others the galleries over\r\nthe pit:[1038] but this design cannot be executed, as the principal\r\nbuilding which ought first to be completed is now at a stand. This city\r\nis also rebuilding, upon a far more enlarged plan, the gymnasium,[1039]\r\nwhich was burnt down before my arrival in the province. They have\r\nalready been at some (and, I rather fear, a fruitless) expense. The\r\nstructure is not only irregular and ill-proportioned, but the present\r\narchitect (who, it must be owned, is a rival to the person who was first\r\nemployed) asserts that the walls, although twenty-two feet[1040] in\r\nthickness, are not strong enough to support the superstructure, as the\r\ninterstices are filled up with quarrystones, and the walls are not\r\noverlaid with brickwork. Also the inhabitants of Claudiopolis[1041] are\r\nsinking (I cannot call it erecting) a large public bath, upon a low spot\r\nof ground which lies at the foot of a mountain. The fund appropriated\r\nfor the carrying on of this work arises from the money which those\r\nhonorary members you were pleased to add to the senate paid (or, at\r\nleast, are ready to pay whenever I call upon them) for their\r\nadmission.[1042] As I am afraid, therefore, the public money in the city\r\nof Nicea, and (what is infinitely more valuable than any pecuniary\r\nconsideration) your bounty in that of Nicopolis, should be ill applied,\r\nI must desire you to send hither an architect to inspect, not only the\r\ntheatre, but the bath; in order to consider whether, after all the\r\nexpense which has already been laid out, it will be better to finish\r\nthem upon the present plan, or alter the one, and remove the other, in\r\nas far as may seem necessary: for otherwise we may perhaps throw away\r\nour future cost in endeavoring not to lose what we have already\r\nexpended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIX -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nYou, who are upon the spot, will best be able to consider and determine\r\nwhat is proper to be done concerning the theatre which the inhabitants\r\nof Nicea are building; as for myself, it will be sufficient if you let\r\nme know your determination. With respect to the particular parts of this\r\ntheatre which are to be raised at a private charge, you will see those\r\nengagements fulfilled when the body of the building to which they are to\r\nbe annexed shall be finished. -- These paltry Greeks[1043] are, I know,\r\nimmoderately fond of gymnastic diversions, and therefore, perhaps, the\r\ncitizens of Nicea have planned a more magnificent building for this\r\npurpose than is necessary; however, they must be content with such as\r\nwill be sufficient to answer the purpose for which it is intended. I\r\nleave it entirely to you to persuade the Claudiopolitani as you shall\r\nthink proper with regard to their bath, which they have placed, it\r\nseems, in a very improper situation. As there is no province that is not\r\nfurnished with men of skill and ingenuity, you cannot possibly want\r\narchitects; unless you think it the shortest way to procure them from\r\nRome, when it is generally from Greece that they come to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nWHEN I reflect upon the splendour of your exalted station, and the\r\nmagnanimity of your spirit, nothing, I am persuaded, can be more\r\nsuitable to both than to point out to you such works as are worthy of\r\nyour glorious and immortal name, as being no less useful than\r\nmagnificent. Bordering upon the territories of the city of Nicomedia is\r\na most extensive lake; over which marbles, fruits, woods, and all kinds\r\nof materials, the commodities of the country, are brought over in boats\r\nup to the high-road, at little trouble and expense, but from thence are\r\nconveyed in carriages to the sea-side, at a much greater charge and with\r\ngreat labour. To remedy this inconvenience, many hands will be in\r\nrequest; but upon such an occasion they cannot be wanting: for the\r\ncountry, and particularly the city, is exceedingly populous; and one may\r\nassuredly hope that every person will readily engage in a work which\r\nwill be of universal benefit. It only remains then to send hither, if\r\nyou shall think proper, a surveyor or an architect, in order to examine\r\nwhether the lake lies above the level of the sea; the engineers of this\r\nprovince being of opinion that the former is higher by forty\r\ncubits,[1044] I find there is in the neighbourhood of this place a large\r\ncanal, which was cut by a king of this country; but as it is left\r\nunfinished, it is uncertain whether it was for the purpose of draining\r\nthe adjacent fields, or making a communication between the lake and the\r\nriver. It is equally doubtful too whether the death of the king, or the\r\ndespair of being able to accomplish the design, prevented the completion\r\nof it. If this was the reason, I am so much the more eager and warmly\r\ndesirous, for the sake of your illustrious character (and I hope you\r\nwill pardon me the ambition), that you may have the glory of executing\r\nwhat kings could only attempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLI -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nTHERE is something in the scheme you propose of opening a communication\r\nbetween the lake and the sea, which may, perhaps, tempt me to consent.\r\nBut you must first carefully examine the situation of this body of\r\nwater, what quantity it contains, and from whence it is supplied; lest,\r\nby giving it an opening into the sea, it should be totally drained. You\r\nmay apply to Calpurnius Macer for an engineer, and I will also send you\r\nfrom hence some one skilled in works of this nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nUPON examining into the public expenses of the city of Byzantium, which,\r\nI find, are extremely great, I was informed, Sir, that the appointments\r\nof the ambassador whom they send yearly to you with their homage, and\r\nthe decree which passes in the senate upon that occasion, amount to\r\ntwelve thousand sesterces.[1045] But knowing the generous maxims of your\r\ngovernment, I thought proper to send the decree without the ambassador,\r\nthat, at the same time they discharged their public duty to you, their\r\nexpense incurred in the manner of paying it might be lightened. This\r\ncity is likewise taxed with the sum of three thousand sesterces[1046]\r\ntowards defraying the expense of an envoy, whom they annually send to\r\ncompliment the governor of Moesia: this expense I have also directed to\r\nbe spared. I beg, Sir, you would deign either to confirm my judgment or\r\ncorrect my error in these points, by acquainting me with your\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nI ENTIRELY approve, my dearest Secundus, of your having excused the\r\nByzantines that expense of twelve thousand sesterces in sending an\r\nambassador to me. I shall esteem their duty as sufficiently paid, though\r\nI only receive the act of their senate through your hands. The governor\r\nof Moesia must likewise excuse them if they compliment him at a less\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIV -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nI BEG, Sir, you would settle a doubt I have concerning your\r\ndiplomas;[1047] whether you think proper that those diplomas the dates\r\nof which are expired shall continue in force, and for how long? For I am\r\napprehensive I may, through ignorance, either confirm such of these\r\ninstruments as are illegal or prevent the effect of those which are\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLV -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nTHE diplomas whose dates are expired must by no means be made use of.\r\nFor which reason it is an inviolable rule with me to send new\r\ninstruments of this kind into all the provinces before they are\r\nimmediately wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVI -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nUPON intimating, Sir, my intention to the city of Apamea,[1048] of\r\nexamining into the state of their public dues, their revenue and\r\nexpenses, they told me they were all extremely willing I should inspect\r\ntheir accounts, but that no proconsul had ever yet looked them over, as\r\nthey had a privilege (and that of a very ancient date) of administering\r\nthe affairs of their corporation in the manner they thought proper. I\r\nrequired them to draw up a memorial of what they then asserted, which I\r\ntransmit to you precisely as I received it; though I am sensible it\r\ncontains several things foreign to the question. I beg you will deign to\r\ninstruct me as to how I am to act in this affair, for I should be\r\nextremely sorry either to exceed or fall short of the duties of my\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nTHE memorial of the Apanieans annexed to your letter has saved me the\r\nnecessity of considering the reasons they suggest why the former\r\nproconsuls forbore to inspect their accounts, since they are willing to\r\nsubmit them to your examination. Their honest compliance deserves to be\r\nrewarded; and they may be assured the enquiry you are to make in\r\npursuance of my orders shall be with a full reserve to their privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVIII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nTHE Nicomedians, Sir, before my arrival in this province, had begun to\r\nbuild a new forum adjoining their former, in a corner of which stands an\r\nancient temple dedicated to the mother of the gods.[1049] This fabric\r\nmust either be repaired or removed, and for this reason chiefly, because\r\nit is a much lower building than that very lofty one which is now in\r\nprocess of erection. Upon enquiry whether this temple had been\r\nconsecrated, I was informed that their ceremonies of dedication differ\r\nfrom ours. You will be pleased therefore, Sir, to consider whether a\r\ntemple which has not been consecrated according to our rites may be\r\nremoved,[1040b] consistently with the reverence due to religion: for, if\r\nthere should be no objection from that quarter, the removal in every\r\nother respect would be extremely convenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIX -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nYou may without scruple, my dearest Secundus, if the situation requires\r\nit, remove the temple of the mother of the gods, from the place where it\r\nnow stands, to any other spot more convenient. You need be under no\r\ndifficulty with respect to the act of dedication; for the ground of a\r\nforeign city [1041b] is not capable of receiving that kind of\r\nconsecration which is sanctified by our laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLX -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nWE have celebrated, Sir (with those sentiments of joy your virtues so\r\njustly merit), the day of your accession to the empire, which was also\r\nits preservation, imploring the gods to preserve you in health and\r\nprosperity; for upon your welfare the security and repose of the world\r\ndepends. I renewed at the same time the oath of allegiance at the head\r\nof the army, which repeated it after me in the usual form, the people of\r\nthe province zealously concurring in the same oath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXI -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nYOUR letter, my dearest Secundus, was extremely acceptable, as it\r\ninformed me of the zeal and affection with which you, together with the\r\narmy and the provincials, solemnised the day of my accession to the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nTHE debts which we are owing to the public are, by the prudence, Sir, of\r\nyour counsels, and the care of my administration, either actually paid\r\nin or now being collected: but I am afraid the money must lie\r\nunemployed. For as on one side there are few or no opportunities of\r\npurchasing land, so, on the other, one cannot meet with any person who\r\nis willing to borrow of the public [1042b] (especially at 12 per cent,\r\ninterest) when they can raise money upon the same terms from private\r\nsources. You will consider then, Sir, whether it may not be advisable,\r\nin order to invite responsible persons to take this money, to lower the\r\ninterest; or if that scheme should not succeed, to place it in the hands\r\nof the decurii, upon their giving sufficient security to the public. And\r\nthough they should not be willing to receive it, yet as the rate of\r\ninterest will be diminished, the hardship will be so much the less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nI AGREE with you, my dear Pliny, that there seems to be no other method\r\nof facilitating the placing out of the public money than by lowering the\r\ninterest; the measure of which you will determine according to the\r\nnumber of the borrowers. But to compel persons to receive it who are not\r\ndisposed to do so, when possibly they themselves may have no opportunity\r\nof employing it, is by no means consistent with the justice of my\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIV -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nI RETURN you my warmest acknowledgments, Sir, that, among the many\r\nimportant occupations in which you are engaged you have condescended to\r\nbe my guide on those points on which I have consulted you: a favour\r\nwhich I must now again beseech you to grant me. A certain person\r\npresented himself with a complaint that his adversaries, who had been\r\nbanished for three years by the illustrious Servilius Calvus, still\r\nremained in the province: they, on the contrary, affirmed that Calvus\r\nhad revoked their sentence, and produced his edict to that effect. I\r\nthought it necessary therefore to refer the whole affair to you. For as\r\nI have your express orders not to restore any person who has been\r\nsentenced to banishment either by myself or others so I have no\r\ndirections with respect to those who, having been banished by some of my\r\npredecessors in this government, have by them also been restored. It is\r\nnecessary for me, therefore, to beg you would inform me, Sir, how I am\r\nto act with regard to the above- mentioned persons, as well as others,\r\nwho, after having been condemned to perpetual banishment, have been\r\nfound in the province without permission to return; for cases of that\r\nnature have likewise fallen under my cognisance. A person was brought\r\nbefore me who had been sentenced to perpetual exile by the proconsul\r\nJulius Bassus, but knowing that the acts of Bassus, during his\r\nadministration, had been rescinded, and that the senate had granted\r\nleave to all those who had fallen under his condemnation of appealing\r\nfrom his decision at any time within the space of two years, I enquired\r\nof this man whether he had, accordingly, stated his case to the\r\nproconsul. He replied he had not. I beg then you would inform me whether\r\nyou would have him sent back into exile or whether you think some more\r\nsevere and what kind of punishment should be inflicted upon him, and\r\nsuch others who may hereafter be found under the same circumstances. I\r\nhave annexed to my letter the decree of Calvus, and the edict by which\r\nthe persons above-mentioned were restored, as also the decree of Bassus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXV -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nI WILL let you know my determination concerning those exiles which were\r\nbanished for three years by the proconsul P. Servilius Calvus, and soon\r\nafterwards restored to the province by his edict, when I shall have\r\ninformed myself from him of the reasons of this proceeding. With respect\r\nto that person who was sentenced to perpetual banishment by Julius\r\nBassus, yet continued to remain in the province, without making his\r\nappeal if he thought himself aggrieved (though he had two years given\r\nhim for that purpose), I would have sent in chains to my praetorian\r\nprefects: [1043b] for, only to remand him back to a punishment which he\r\nhas contumaciously eluded will by no means be a sufficient punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVI -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nWHEN I cited the judges, Sir, to attend me at a sessions [1044b] which I\r\nwas going to hold, Flavius Archippus claimed the privilege of being\r\nexcused as exercising the profession of a philosopher. [1045b] It was\r\nalleged by some who were present that he ought not only to be excused\r\nfrom that office, but even struck out of the rolls of judges, and\r\nremanded back to the punishment from which he had escaped, by breaking\r\nhis chains. At the same time a sentence of the proconsul Velius Paullus\r\nwas read, by which it appeared that Archippus had been condemned to the\r\nmines for forgery. He had nothing to produce in proof of this sentence\r\nhaving ever been reversed. He alleged, however, in favour of his\r\nrestitution, a petition which he presented to Domitian, together with a\r\nletter from that prince, and a decree of the Prusensians in his honour.\r\nTo these he subjoined a letter which he had received from you; as also\r\nan edict and a letter of your august father confirming the grants which\r\nhad been made to him by Domitian. For these reasons, notwithstandng\r\ncrimes of so atrocious a nature were laid to his charge, I did not think\r\nproper to determine anything concerning him, without first consulting\r\nwith you, as it is an affair which seems to merit your particular\r\ndecision. I have transmitted to you, with this letter, the several\r\nallegations on both sides.\r\n\r\nDOMITIAN'S LETTER TO TERENTIUS MAXIMUS\r\n\r\n\"Flavius Archippus the philosopher has prevailed with me to give an\r\norder that six hundred thousand sesterces [1046b] be laid out in the\r\npurchase of an estate for the support of him and his family, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Prusias, [1047b] his native country. Let this be\r\naccordingly done; and place that sum to the account of my benefactions.\"\r\n\r\nFROM THE SAME TO L. APPIUS MAXIMUS\r\n\r\n\"I recommend, my dear Maximus, to your protection that worthy\r\nphilosopher Archippus; a person whose moral conduct is agreeable to the\r\nprinciples of the philosophy he professes; and I would have you pay\r\nentire regard to whatever he shall reasonably request.\"\r\n\r\nTHE EDICT OF THE EMPEROR NERVA\r\n\r\n\"There are some points no doubt, Quirites, concerning which the happy\r\ntenour of my government is a sufficient indication of my sentiments; and\r\na good prince need not give an express declaration in matters wherein\r\nhis intention cannot but be clearly understood. Every citizen in the\r\nempire will bear me witness that I gave up my private repose to the\r\nsecurity of the public, and in order that I might have the pleasure of\r\ndispensing new bounties of my own, as also of confirming those which had\r\nbeen granted by predecessors. But lest the memory of him [1048b] who\r\nconferred these grants, or the diffidence of those who received them,\r\nshould occasion any interruption to the public joy, I thought it as\r\nnecessary as it is agreeable to me to obviate these suspicions by\r\nassuring them of my indulgence. I do not wish any man who has obtained a\r\nprivate or a public privilege from one of the former emperors to imagine\r\nhe is to be deprived of such a privilege, merely that he may owe the\r\nrestoration of it to me; nor need any who have received the\r\ngratifications of imperial favour petition me to have them confirmed.\r\nRather let them leave me at leisure for conferring new grants, under the\r\nassurance that I am only to be solicited for those bounties which have\r\nnot already been obtained, and which the happier fortune of the empire\r\nhas put it in my power to bestow.\"\r\n\r\nFROM THE SAME TO TULLIUS JUSTUS\r\n\r\n\"Since I have publicly decreed that all acts begun and accomplished in\r\nformer reigns should be confirmed, the letters of Domitian must remain\r\nvalid.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS ARCHIPPUS has conjured me, by all my vows for your prosperity,\r\nand by your immortal glory, that I would transmit to you the memorial\r\nwhich he presented to me. I could not refuse a request couched in such\r\nterms; however, I acquainted the prosecutrix with this my intention,\r\nfrom whom I have also received a memorial on her part. I have annexed\r\nthem both to this letter; that by hearing, as it were, each party, you\r\nmay the better be enabled to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLX VIII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nIT is possible that Domitian might have been ignorant of the\r\ncircumstances in which Archippus was when he wrote the letter so much to\r\nthat philosopher's credit. However, it is more agreeable to my\r\ndisposition to suppose that prince designed he should be restored to his\r\nformer situation; especially since he so often had the honour of a\r\nstatue decreed to him by those who could not be ignorant of the sentence\r\npronounced against him by the proconsul Paullus. But I do not mean to\r\nintimate, my dear Pliny, that if any new charge should be brought\r\nagainst him, you should be the less disposed to hear his accusers. I\r\nhave examined the memorial of his prosecutrix, Furia Prima, as well as\r\nthat of Archippus himself, which you sent with your last letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIX -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nTHE apprehensions you express, Sir, that the lake will be in danger of\r\nbeing entirely drained if a communication should be opened between that\r\nand the sea, by means of the river, are agreeable to that prudence and\r\nforethought you so eminently possess; but I think I have found a method\r\nto obviate that inconvenience. A channel may be cut from the lake up to\r\nthe river so as not quite to join them, leaving just a narrow strip of\r\nland between, preserving the lake; by this means it will not only be\r\nkept quite separate from the river, but all the same purposes will be\r\nanswered as if they were united: for it will be extremely easy to convey\r\nover that little intervening ridge whatever goods shall be brought down\r\nby the canal. This is a scheme which may be pursued, if it should be\r\nfound necessary; but I hope there will be no occasion to have recourse\r\nto it. For, in the first place, the lake itself is pretty deep; and in\r\nthe next, by damming up the river which runs from it on the opposite\r\nside and turning its course as we shall find expedient, the same\r\nquantity of water may be retained. Besides, there are several brooks\r\nnear the place where it is proposed the channel shall be cut which, if\r\nskilfully collected, will supply the lake with water in proportion to\r\nwhat it shall discharge. But if you should rather approve of the\r\nchannel's being extended farther and cut narrower, and so conveyed\r\ndirectly into the sea, without running into the river, the reflux of the\r\ntide will return whatever it receives from the lake. After all, if the\r\nnature of the place should not admit of any of these schemes, the course\r\nof the water may be checked by sluices. These, however, and many other\r\nparticulars, will be more skilfully examined into by the engineer, whom,\r\nindeed, Sir, you ought to send, according to your promise, for it is an\r\nenterprise well worthy of your attention and magnificence. In the\r\nmeanwhile, I have written to the illustrious Calpurnius Macer, in\r\npursuance of your orders, to send me the most skilful engineer to be\r\nhad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXX -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nIT is evident, my dearest Secundus, that neither your prudence nor your\r\ncare has been wanting in this affair of the lake, since, in order to\r\nrender it of more general benefit, you have provided so many expedients\r\nagainst the danger of its being drained. I leave it to your own choice\r\nto pursue whichever of the schemes shall be thought most proper.\r\nCalpurnius Macer will furnish you, no doubt, with an engineer, as\r\nartificers of that kind are not wanting in his province.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXI -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nA VERY considerable question, Sir, in which the whole province is\r\ninterested, has been lately started, concerning the state [1049b] and\r\nmaintenance of deserted children.[1050] I have examined the\r\nconstitutions of former princes upon this head, but not finding anything\r\nin them relating, either in general or particular, to the Bithynians, I\r\nthought it necessary to apply to you for your directions: for in a point\r\nwhich seems to require the special interposition of your authority, I\r\ncould not content myself with following precedents. An edict of the\r\nemperor Augustus (as pretended) was read to me, concerning one Annia; as\r\nalso a letter from Vespasian to the Lacedaemonians, and another from\r\nTitus to the same, with one likewise from him to the Achaeans, also some\r\nletters from Domitian, directed to the proconsuls Avidius Nigrinus and\r\nArmenius Brocchus, together with one from that prince to the\r\nLacedaemonians: but I have not transmitted them to you, as they were not\r\ncorrect (and some of them too of doubtful authenticity), and also\r\nbecause I imagine the true copies are preserved in your archives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXII TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nTHE question concerning children who were exposed by their parents, and\r\nafterwards preserved by others, and educated in a state of servitude,\r\nthough born free, has been frequently discussed; but I do not find in\r\nthe constitutions of the princes my predecessors any general regulation\r\nupon this head, extending to all the provinces. There are, indeed, some\r\nrescripts of Domitian to Avidius Nigrinus and Armenhis Brocchus, which\r\nought to be observed; but Bithynia is not comprehended in the provinces\r\ntherein mentioned. I am of opinion therefore that the claims of those\r\nwho assert their right of freedom upon this footing should be allowed;\r\nwithout obliging them to purchase their liberty by repaying the money\r\nadvanced for their maintenance.[1051]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nHAVING been petitioned by some persons to grant them the liberty\r\n(agreeably to the practice of former proconsuls) of removing the relics\r\nof their deceased relations, upon the suggestion that either their\r\nmonuments were decayed by age or ruined by the inundations of the river,\r\nor for other reasons of the same kind, I thought proper, Sir, knowing\r\nthat in cases of this nature it is usual at Rome to apply to the college\r\nof priests, to consult you, who are the sovereign of that sacred order,\r\nas to how you would have me act in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXX IV -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nIT will be a hardship upon the provincials to oblige them to address\r\nthemselves to the college of priests whenever they may have just reasons\r\nfor removing the ashes of their ancestors. In this case, therefore, it\r\nwill be better you should follow the example of the governors your\r\npredecessors, and grant or deny them this liberty as you shall see\r\nreasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXV -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nI HAVE enquired, Sir, at Prusa, for a proper place on which to erect the\r\nbath you were pleased to allow that city to build, and I have found one\r\nto my satisfaction. It is upon the site where formerly, I am told, stood\r\na very beautiful mansion, but which is now entirely fallen into ruins.\r\nBy fixing upon that spot, we shall gain the advantage of ornamenting the\r\ncity in a part which at present is exceedingly deformed, and enlarging\r\nit at the same time without removing any of the buildings; only\r\nrestoring one which is fallen to decay. There are some circumstances\r\nattending this structure of which it is proper I should inform you.\r\nClaudius Polyaenus bequeathed it to the emperor Claudius Cæsar, with\r\ndirections that a temple should be erected to that prince in a\r\ncolonnade-court, and that the remainder of the house should be let in\r\napartments. The city received the rents for a considerable time; but\r\npartly by its having been plundered, and partly by its being neglected,\r\nthe whole house, colonnade-court, and all, is entirely gone to ruin, and\r\nthere is now scarcely anything remaining of it but the ground upon which\r\nit stood. If you shall think proper, Sir, either to give or sell this\r\nspot of ground to the city, as it lies so conveniently for their\r\npurpose, they will receive it as a most particular favour. I intend,\r\nwith your permission, to place the bath in the vacant area, and to\r\nextend a range of porticoes with seats in that part where the former\r\nedifice stood. This new erection I purpose dedicating to you, by whose\r\nbounty it will rise with all the elegance and magnificence worthy of\r\nyour glorious name. I have sent you a copy of the will, by which, though\r\nit is inaccurate, you will see that Polyaenus left several articles of\r\nornament for the embellishment of this house; but these also are lost\r\nwith all the rest: I will, however, make the strictest enquiry after\r\nthem that I am able.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVI -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\n1 HAVE no objection to the Prusenses making use of the ruined court and\r\nhouse, which you say are untenanted, for the erection of their bath. But\r\nit is not sufficiently clear by your letter whether the temple in the\r\ncentre of the colonnade-court was actually dedicated to Claudius or not;\r\nfor if it were, it is still consecrated ground.[1052]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nI HAVE been pressed by some persons to take upon myself the enquiry of\r\ncauses relating to claims of freedom by birth-right, agreeably to a\r\nrescript of Domitian's to Minucius Rufus, and the practice of former\r\nproconsuls. But upon casting my eye on the decree of the senate\r\nconcerning cases of this nature, I find it only mentions the proconsular\r\nprovinces.[1053] I have therefore, Sir, deferred interfering in this\r\naffair, till I shall receive your instructions as to how you would have\r\nme proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVIII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nIF you will send me the decree of the senate, which occasioned your\r\ndoubt, I shall be able to judge whether it is proper you should take\r\nupon yourself the enquiry of causes relating to claims of freedom by\r\nbirth-right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIX -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nJULIUS LARGUS, of Ponus[1054] (a person whom I never saw nor indeed ever\r\nheard his name till lately), in confidence, Sir, of your distinguishing\r\njudgment in my favour, has entrusted me with the execution of the last\r\ninstance of his loyalty towards you. He has left me, by his will, his\r\nestate upon trust, in the first place to receive out of it fifty\r\nthousand sesterces[1055] for my own use, and to apply the remainder for\r\nthe benefit of the cities of Heraclea and Tios,[1056] either by erecting\r\nsome public edifice dedicated to your honour or instituting athletic\r\ngames, according as I shall judge proper. These games are to be\r\ncelebrated every five years, and to be called Trajan's games. My\r\nprincipal reason for acquainting you with this bequest is that I may\r\nreceive your directions which of the respective alternatives to choose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXX -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nBy the prudent choice Julius Largus has made of a trustee, one would\r\nimagine he had known you perfectly well. You will consider then what\r\nwill most tend to perpetuate his memory, under the circumstances of the\r\nrespective cities, and make your option accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXI -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nYou acted agreeably, Sir, to your usual prudence and foresight in\r\nordering the illustrious Calpurnius Macer to send a legionary centurion\r\nto Byzantium: you will consider whether the city of Juliopolis' does not\r\ndeserve the same regard, which, though it is extremely small, sustains\r\nvery great burthens, and is so much the more exposed to injuries as it\r\nis less capable of resisting them. Whatever benefits you shall confer\r\nupon that city will in effect be advantageous to the whole country; for\r\nit is situated at the entrance of Bithynia, and is the town through\r\nwhich all who travel into this province generally pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nTHE circumstances of the city of Byzantium are such, by the great\r\nconfluence of strangers to it, that I held it incumbent upon me, and\r\nconsistent with the customs of former reigns, to send thither a\r\nlegionary centurion's guard to preserve the privileges of that state.\r\nBut if we should distinguish the city of Juliopolis[1057] in the same\r\nway, it will be introducing a precedent for many others, whose claim to\r\nthat favour will rise in proportion to their want of strength. I have so\r\nmuch confidence, however, in your administration as to believe you will\r\nomit no method of protecting them from injuries. If any persons shall\r\nact contrary to the discipline I have enjoined, let them be instantly\r\ncorrected; or if they happen to be soldiers, and their crimes should be\r\ntoo enormous for immediate chastisement, I would have them sent to their\r\nofficers, with an account of the particular misdemeanour you shall find\r\nthey have been guilty of; but if the delinquents should be on their way\r\nto Rome, inform me by letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nBY a law of Pompey's[1058] concerning the Bithynians, it is enacted,\r\nSir, that no person shall be a magistrate, or be chosen into the senate,\r\nunder the age of thirty. By the same law it is declared that those who\r\nhave exercised the office of magistrate are qualified to be members of\r\nthe senate. Subsequent to this law, the emperor Augustus published an\r\nedict, by which it was ordained that persons of the age of twenty-two\r\nshould be capable of being magistrates. The question therefore is\r\nwhether those who have exercised the functions of a magistrate before\r\nthe age of thirty may be legally chosen into the senate by the\r\ncensors?[1059] And if so, whether, by the same kind of construction,\r\nthey may be elected senators, at the age which entitles them to be\r\nmagistrates, though they should not actually have borne any office? A\r\ncustom which, it seems, has hitherto been observed, and is said to be\r\nexpedient, as it is rather better that persons of noble birth should be\r\nadmitted into the senate than those of plebeian rank. The censors elect\r\nhaving desired my sentiments upon this point, I was of opinion that both\r\nby the law of Pompey and the edict of Augustus those who had exercised\r\nthe magistracy before the age of thirty might be chosen into the senate;\r\nand for this reason, because the edict allows the office of magistrate\r\nto be undertaken before thirty; and the law declares that whoever has\r\nbeen a magistrate should be eligible for the senate. But with respect to\r\nthose who never discharged any office in the state, though they were of\r\nthe age required for that purpose, I had some doubt: and therefore, Sir,\r\nI apply to you for your directions. I have subjoined to this letter the\r\nheads of the law, together with the edict of Augustus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIV -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nI AGREE with you, my dearest Secundus, in your construction, and am of\r\nopinion that the law of Pompey is so far repealed by the edict of the\r\nemperor Augustus that those persons who are not less than twenty-two\r\nyears of age may execute the office of magistrates, and, when they have,\r\nmay be received into the senate of their respective cities. But I think\r\nthat they who are under thirty years of age, and have not discharged the\r\nfunction of a magistrate, cannot, upon pretence that in point of years\r\nthey were competent to the office, legally be elected into the senate of\r\ntheir several communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXV -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nWHILST I was despatching some public affairs, Sir, at my apartments in\r\nPrusa, at the foot of Olympus, with the intention of leaving that city\r\nthe same day, the magistrate Asclepiades informed me that Eumolpus had\r\nappealed to me from a motion which Cocceianus Dion made in their senate.\r\nDion, it seems, having been appointed supervisor of a public building,\r\ndesired that it might be assigned[1060] to the city in form. Eumolpus,\r\nwho was counsel for Flavius Archippus, insisted that Dion should first\r\nbe required to deliver in his accounts relating to this work, before it\r\nwas assigned to the corporation; suggesting that he had not acted in the\r\nmanner he ought. He added, at the same time, that in this building, in\r\nwhich your statue is erected, the bodies of Dion's wife and son are\r\nentombed,[1061] and urged me to hear this cause in the public court of\r\njudicature. Upon my at once assenting to his request, and deferring my\r\njourney for that purpose, he desired a longer day in order to prepare\r\nmatters for hearing, and that I would try this cause in some other city.\r\nI appointed the city of Nicea; where, when I had taken my seat, the same\r\nEumolpus, pretending not to be yet sufficiently instructed, moved that\r\nthe trial might be again put off: Dion, on the contrary, insisted it\r\nshould be heard. They debated this point very fully on both sides, and\r\nentered a little into the merits of the cause; when being of opinion\r\nthat it was reasonable it should be adjourned, and thinking it proper to\r\nconsult with you in an affair which was of consequence in point of\r\nprecedent, I directed them to exhibit the articles of their respective\r\nallegations in writing; for I was desirous you should judge from their\r\nown representations of the state of the question between them. Dion\r\npromised to comply with this direction and Eumolpus also assured me he\r\nwould draw up a memorial of what he had to allege on the part of the\r\ncommunity. But he added that, being only concerned as advocate on behalf\r\nof Archippus, whose instructions he had laid before me, he had no charge\r\nto bring with respect to the sepulchres. Archippus, however, for whom\r\nEulnolpus was counsel here, as at Prusa, assured me he would himself\r\npresent a charge in form upon this head. But neither Eumolpus nor\r\nArchippus (though I have waited several days for that purpose) have yet\r\nperformed their engagement: Dion indeed has; and I have annexed his\r\nmemorial to this letter. I have inspected the buildings in question,\r\nwhere I find your statue is placed in a library, and as to the edifice\r\nin which the bodies of Dion's wife and son are said to be deposited, it\r\nstands in the middle of a court, which is enclosed with a colonnade.\r\nDeign, therefore, I entreat you, Sir, to direct my judgment in the\r\ndetermination of this cause above all others as it is a point to which\r\nthe public is greatly attentive, and necessarily so, since the fact is\r\nnot only acknowledged, but countenanced by many precedents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVI -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nYou well know, my dearest Secundus, that it is my standing maxim not to\r\ncreate an awe of my person by severe and rigorous measures, and by\r\nconstruing every slight offence into an act of treason; you had no\r\nreason, therefore, to hesitate a moment upon the point concerning which\r\nyou thought proper to consult me. Without entering therefore into the\r\nmerits of that question (to which I would by no means give any\r\nattention, though there were ever so many instances of the same kind), I\r\nrecommend to your care the examination of Dion's accounts relating to\r\nthe public works which he has finished; as it is a case in which the\r\ninterest of the city is concerned, and as Dion neither ought nor, it\r\nseems, does refuse to submit to the examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nTHE Niceans having, in the name of their community, conjured me, Sir, by\r\nall my hopes and wishes for your prosperity and immortal glory (an\r\nadjuration which is and ought to be most sacred to me), to present to\r\nyou their petition, I did not think myself at liberty to refuse them: I\r\nhave therefore annexed it to this letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVIII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nTHE Niceans I find, claim a right, by an edict of Augustus, to the\r\nestate of every citizen who dies intestate. You will therefore summon\r\nthe several parties interested in this question, and, examining these\r\npretensions, with the assistance of the procurators Virdius Gemellinus,\r\nand Epimachus, my freedman (having duly weighed every argument that\r\nshall be alleged against the claim), determine as shall appear most\r\nequitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIX -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nMAY this and many succeeding birthdays be attended, Sir, with the\r\nhighest felicity to you; and may you, in the midst of an uninterrupted\r\ncourse of health and prosperity, be still adding to the increase of that\r\nimmortal glory which your virtues justly merit!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXC -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nYOUR wishes, my dearest Secundus, for my enjoyment of many happy\r\nbirthdays amidst the glory and prosperity of the republic were extremely\r\nagreeable to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCI -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nTHE inhabitants of Sinope[1062] are ill supplied, Sir, with water, which\r\nhowever may be brought thither from about sixteen miles' distance in\r\ngreat plenty and perfection. The ground, indeed, near the source of this\r\nspring is, for rather over a mile, of a very suspicious and marshy\r\nnature; but I have directed an examination to be made (which will be\r\neffected at a small expense) whether it is sufficiently firm to support\r\nany superstructure. I have taken care to provide a sufficient fund for\r\nthis purpose, if you should approve, Sir, of a work so conducive to the\r\nhealth and enjoyment of this colony, greatly distressed by a scarcity of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nI WOULD have you proceed, my dearest Secundus, in carefully examining\r\nwhether the ground you suspect is firm enough to support an aqueduct.\r\nFor I have no manner of doubt that the Sinopian colony ought to be\r\nsupplied with water; provided their finances will bear the expense of a\r\nwork so conducive to their health and pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nTHE free and confederate city of the Amiseni[1063] enjoys, by your\r\nindulgence, the privilege of its own laws. A memorial being presented to\r\nme there, concerning a charitable institution,[1064] I have subjoined it\r\nto this letter, that you may consider, Sir, whether, and how far, this\r\nsociety ought to be licensed or prohibited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIV -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nIF the petition of the Amiseni which you have transmitted to me,\r\nconcerning the establishment of a charitable society, be agreeable to\r\ntheir own laws, which by the articles of alliance it is stipulated they\r\nshall enjoy, I shall not oppose it; especially if these contributions\r\nare employed, not for the purpose of riot and faction, but for the\r\nsupport of the indigent. In other cities, however, which are subject to\r\nour laws, I would have all assemblies of this nature prohibited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCV -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nSUETONIUS TRANQUILLUS, Sir, is a most excellent, honour-able, and\r\nlearned man. I was so much pleased with his tastes and disposition that\r\nI have long since invited him into my family, as my constant guest and\r\ndomestic friend; and my affection for him increased the more I knew of\r\nhim. Two reasons concur to render the privileges which the law grants to\r\nthose who have three children particularly necessary to him; I mean the\r\nbounty of his friends, and the ill-success of his marriage. Those\r\nadvantages, therefore, which nature has denied to him, he hopes to\r\nobtain from your goodness, by my intercession. I am thoroughly sensible,\r\nSir, of the value of the privilege I am asking; but I know, too, I am\r\nasking it from one whose gracious compliance with all my desires I have\r\namply experienced. How passionately I wish to do so in the present\r\ninstance, you will judge by my thus requesting it in my absence; which I\r\nwould not, had it not been a favour which I am more than ordinarily\r\nanxious to obtain.[1065]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVI -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nYou cannot but be sensible, my dearest Secundus, how reserved I am in\r\ngranting favours of the kind you desire; having frequently declared in\r\nthe senate that I had not exceeded the number of which I assured that\r\nillustrious order I would be contented with. I have yielded, however, to\r\nyour request, and have directed an article to be inserted in my\r\nregister, that I have conferred upon Tranquillus, on my usual\r\nconditions, the privilege which the law grants to these who have three\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVII To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN[1066]\r\n\r\nIT is my invariable rule, Sir, to refer to you in all matters where I\r\nfeel doubtful; for who is more capable of removing my scruples, or\r\ninforming my ignorance? Having never been present at any trials\r\nconcerning those who profess Christianity, I am unacquainted not only\r\nwith the nature of their crimes, or the measure of their punishment, but\r\nhow far it is proper to enter into an examination concerning them.\r\nWhether, therefore, any difference is usually made with respect to ages,\r\nor no distinction is to be observed between the young and the adult;\r\nwhether repentance entitles them to a pardon; or if a man has been once\r\na Christian, it avails nothing to desist from his error; whether the\r\nvery profession of Christianity, unattended with any criminal act, or\r\nonly the crimes themselves inherent in the profession are punishable; on\r\nall these points I am in great doubt. In the meanwhile, the method I\r\nhave observed towards those who have been brought before me as\r\nChristians is this: I asked them whether they were Christians; if they\r\nadmitted it, I repeated the question twice, and threatened them with\r\npunishment; if they persisted, I ordered them to be at once punished:\r\nfor I was persuaded, whatever the nature of their opinions might be, a\r\ncontumacious and inflexible obstinacy certainly deserved correction.\r\nThere were others also brought before me possessed with the same\r\ninfatuation, but being Roman citizens,[1067] I directed them to be sent\r\nto Rome. But this crime spreading (as is usually the case) while it was\r\nactually under prosecution, several instances of the same nature\r\noccurred. An anonymous information was laid before me containing a\r\ncharge against several persons, who upon examination denied they were\r\nChristians, or had ever been so. They repeated after me an invocation to\r\nthe gods, and offered religious rites with wine and incense before your\r\nstatue (which for that purpose I had ordered to be brought, together\r\nwith those of the gods), and even reviled the name of Christ: whereas\r\nthere is no forcing, it is said, those who are really Christians into\r\nany of these compliances: I thought it proper, therefore, to discharge\r\nthem. Some among those who were accused by a witness in person at first\r\nconfessed themselves Christians, but immediately after denied it; the\r\nrest owned indeed that they had been of that number formerly, but had\r\nnow (some above three, others more, and a few above twenty years ago)\r\nrenounced that error. They all worshipped your statue and the images of\r\nthe gods, uttering imprecations at the same time against the name of\r\nChrist. They affirmed the whole of their guilt, or their error, was,\r\nthat they met on a stated day before it was light, and addressed a form\r\nof prayer to Christ, as to a divinity, binding themselves by a solemn\r\noath, not for the purposes of any wicked design, but never to commit any\r\nfraud, theft, or adultery, never to falsify their word, nor deny a trust\r\nwhen they should be called upon to deliver it up; after which it was\r\ntheir custom to separate, and then reassemble, to eat in common a\r\nharmless meal. From this custom, however, they desisted after the\r\npublication of my edict, by which, according to your commands, I forbade\r\nthe meeting of any assemblies. After receiving this account, I judged it\r\nso much the more necessary to endeavor to extort the real truth, by\r\nputting two female slaves to the torture, who were said to officiate' in\r\ntheir religious rites: but all I could discover was evidence of an\r\nabsurd and extravagant superstition. I deemed it expedient, therefore,\r\nto adjourn all further proceedings, in order to consult you. For it\r\nappears to be a matter highly deserving your consideration, more\r\nespecially as great numbers must be involved in the danger of these\r\nprosecutions, which have already extended, and are still likely to\r\nextend, to persons of all ranks and ages, and even of both sexes. In\r\nfact, this contagious superstition is not confined to the cities only,\r\nbut has spread its infection among the neighbouring villages and\r\ncountry. Nevertheless, it still seems possible to restrain its progress.\r\nThe temples, at least, which were once almost deserted, begin now to be\r\nfrequented; and the sacred rites, after a long intermission, are again\r\nrevived; while there is a general demand for the victims, which till\r\nlately found very few purchasers. From all this it is easy to conjecture\r\nwhat numbers might be reclaimed if a general pardon were granted to\r\nthose who shall repent of their error.[1068]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVIII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nYou have adopted the right course, my dearest Secundtis, in\r\ninvestigating the charges against the Christians who were brought before\r\nyou. It is not possible to lay down any general rule for all such cases.\r\nDo not go out of your way to look for them. If indeed they should be\r\nbrought before you, and the crime is proved, they must be\r\npunished;[1069] with the restriction, however, that where the party\r\ndenies he is a Christian, and shall make it evident that he is not, by\r\ninvoking our gods, let him (notwithstanding any former suspicion) be\r\npardoned upon his repentance. Anonymous informations ought not to be\r\nreceived in any sort of prosecution. It is introducing a very dangerous\r\nprecedent, and is quite foreign to the spirit of our age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIX -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nTHE elegant and beautiful city of Amastris,[1070] Sir, has, among other\r\nprincipal constructions, a very fine street and of considerable length,\r\non one entire side of which runs what is called indeed a river, but in\r\nfact is no other than a vile common sewer, extremely offensive to the\r\neye, and at the same time very pestilential on account of its noxious\r\nsmell. It will be advantageous, therefore, in point of health, as well\r\nas decency, to have it covered; which shall be done with your\r\npermission: as I will take care, on my part, that money be not wanting\r\nfor executing so noble and necessary a work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nIT IS highly reasonable, my dearest Secundus, if the water which runs\r\nthrough the city of Amastris is prejudicial, while uncovered, to the\r\nhealth of the inhabitants, that it should be covered up. I am well\r\nassured you will, with your usual application, take care that the money\r\nnecessary for this work shall not be wanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCI To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nWE have celebrated, Sir, with great joy and festivity, those votive\r\nsoleninities which were publicly proclaimed as formerly, and renewed\r\nthem the present year, accompanied by the soldiers and provincials, who\r\nzealously joined with us in imploring the gods that they would be\r\ngraciously pleased to preserve you and the republic in that state of\r\nprosperity which your many and great virtues, particularly your piety\r\nand reverence towards them, so justly merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nIT was agreeable to me to learn by your letter that the army and the\r\nprovincials seconded you, with the most joyful unanimity, in those vows\r\nwhich you paid and renewed to the immortal gods for my preservation and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nWE have celebrated, with all the warmth of that pious zeal we justly\r\nought, the day on which, by a most happy succession, the protection of\r\nmankind was committed over into your hands; recommending to the gods,\r\nfrom whom you received the empire, the object of your public vows and\r\ncongratulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIV -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nI WAS extremely well pleased to be informed by your letter that you had,\r\nat the head of the soldiers and the provincials, solemnised my accession\r\nto the empire with all due joy and zeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCV -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nVALERIUS PAULINUS, Sir, having bequeathed to me the right of\r\npatronage[1071] over all his freedmen, except one, I intreat you to\r\ngrant the freedom of Rome to three of them. To desire you to extend this\r\nfavour to all of them would, I fear, be too unreasonable a trespass upon\r\nyour indulgence; which, in proportion as I have amply experienced, I\r\nought to be so much the more cautious in troubling. The persons for whom\r\nI make this request are C. Valerius Astraeus, C. Valerius Dionysius, and\r\nC. Valerius Aper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVI -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nYOU act most generously in so early soliciting in favour of those whom\r\nValerius Paulinus has confided to your trust. I have accordingly granted\r\nthe freedom of the city to such of his freedmen for whom you requested\r\nit, and have directed the patent to be registered: I am ready to confer\r\nthe same on the rest, whenever you shall desire me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nP. ATTIUS AQUILA, a centurion of the sixth equestrian cohort, requested\r\nme, Sir, to transmit his petition to you, in favour of his daughter. I\r\nthought it would be unkind to refuse him this service, knowing, as I do,\r\nwith what patience and kindness you attend to the petitions of the\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVIII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nI HAVE read the petition of P. Attius Aquila, centurion of the sixth\r\nequestrian cohort, which you sent to me; and in compliance with his\r\nrequest, I have conferred upon his daughter the freedom of the city of\r\nRome. I send you at the same time the patent, which you will deliver to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIX -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nI REQUEST, Sir, your directions with respect to the recovering those\r\ndebts which are due to the cities of Bithynia and Pontus, either for\r\nrent, or goods sold, or upon any other consideration. I find they have a\r\nprivilege conceded to them by several proconsuls, of being preferred to\r\nother creditors; and this custom has prevailed as if it had been\r\nestablished by law. Your prudence, I imagine, will think it necessary to\r\nenact some settled rule, by which their rights may always be secured.\r\nFor the edicts of others, how wisely however founded, are but feeble and\r\ntemporary ordinances, unless confirmed and sanctioned by your authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCX -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nTHE right which the cities either of Pontus or Bithynia claim relating\r\nto the recovery of debts of whatever kind, due to their several\r\ncommunities, must be determined agreeably to their respective laws.\r\nWhere any of these communities enjoy the privilege of being preferred to\r\nother creditors, it must be maintained; but, where no such privilege\r\nprevails, it is not just I should establish one, in prejudice of private\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXI -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nTHE solicitor to the treasury of the city of Amisis instituted a claim,\r\nSir, before me against Julius Piso of about forty thousand\r\ndenarii,[1072] presented to him by the public above twenty years ago,\r\nwith the consent of the general council and assembly of the city: and he\r\nfounded his demand upon certain of your edicts, by which donations of\r\nthis kind are prohibited. Piso, on the other hand, asserted that he had\r\nconferred large sums of money upon the community, and, indeed, had\r\nthereby expended almost the whole of his estate. He insisted upon the\r\nlength of time which had intervened since this donation, and hoped that\r\nhe should not be compelled, to the ruin of the remainder of his\r\nfortunes, to refund a present which had been granted him long since, in\r\nreturn for many good offices he had done the city. For this reason, Sir,\r\nI thought it necessary to suspend giving any judgment in this cause till\r\nI shall receive your directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nTHOUGH by my edicts I have ordained that no largesses shall be given out\r\nof the public money, yet, that numberless private persons may not be\r\ndisturbed in the secure possession of their fortunes, those donations\r\nwhich have been made long since ought not to be called in question or\r\nrevoked. We will not therefore enquire into anything that has been\r\ntransacted in this affair so long ago as twenty years; for I would be no\r\nless attentive to secure the repose of every private man than to\r\npreserve the treasure of every public community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXIII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nTHE Pompeian law, Sir, which is observed in Pontus and Bithynia, does\r\nnot direct that any money for their admission shall be paid in by those\r\nwho are elected into the senate by the censors. It has, however, been\r\nusual for such members as have been admitted into those assemblies, in\r\npursuance of the privilege which you were pleased to grant to some\r\nparticular cities, of receiving above their legal number, to pay\r\none[1073] or two thousand denarii[1074] on their election. Subsequent to\r\nthis, the proconsul Anicius Maximus ordained (though indeed his edict\r\nrelated to some few cities only) that those who were elected by the\r\ncensors should also pay into the treasury a certain sum, which varied in\r\ndifferent places. It remains, therefore, for your consideration whether\r\nit would not be proper to settle a certain sum for each member who is\r\nelected into the councils to pay upon his entrance; for it well becomes\r\nyou, whose every word and action deserves to be immortalized, to\r\nestablish laws that shall endure for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXIV -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nI CAN give no general directions applicable to all the cities of\r\nBithynia, in relation to those who are elected members of their\r\nrespective councils, whether they shall pay an honorary fee upon their\r\nadmittance or not. I think that the safest method which can be pursued\r\nis to follow the particular laws of each city; and I also think that the\r\ncensors ought to make the sum less for those who are chosen into the\r\nsenate contrary to their inclinations than for the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXV -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nTHE Pompeian law, Sir, allows the Bithynians to give the freedom of\r\ntheir respective cities to any person they think proper, provided he is\r\nnot a foreigner, but native of some of the cities of this province. The\r\nsame law specifies the particular causes for which the censors may expel\r\nany member of the senate, but makes no mention of foreigners. Certain of\r\nthe censors therefore have desired my opinion whether they ought to\r\nexpel a member if he should happen to be a foreigner. But I thought it\r\nnecessary to receive your instructions in this case; not only because\r\nthe law, though it forbids foreigners to be admitted citizens, does not\r\ndirect that a senator shall be expelled for the same reason, but because\r\nI am informed that in every city in the province a great number of the\r\nsenators are foreigners. If, therefore, this clause of the law, which\r\nseems to be antiquated by a long custom to the contrary, should be\r\nenforced, many cities, as well as private persons, must be injured by\r\nit. I have annexed the heads of this law to my letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXVI -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nYou might well be doubtful, my dearest Secundus, what reply to give to\r\nthe censors, who consulted you concerning their right to elect into the\r\nsenate foreign citizens, though of the same province. The authority of\r\nthe law on one side, and long custom prevailing against it on the other,\r\nmight justly occasion you to hesitate, The proper mean to observe in\r\nthis case will be to make no change in what is past, but to allow those\r\nsenators who are already elected, though contrary to law, to keep their\r\nseats, to whatever city they may belong; in all future elections,\r\nhowever, to pursue the directions of the Pompeian law: for to give it a\r\nretrospective operation would necessarily introduce great confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXVII -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nIT is customary here upon any person taking the manly robe, solemnising\r\nhis marriage, entering upon the office of a magistrate, or dedicating\r\nany public work, to invite the whole senate, together with a\r\nconsiderable part of the commonalty, and distribute to each of the\r\ncompany one or two denarii.[1075] I request you to inform me whether you\r\nthink proper this ceremony should be observed, or how far you approve of\r\nit. For myself, though I am of opinion that upon some occasions,\r\nespecially those of public festivals, this kind of invitation may be\r\npermitted, yet, when carried so far as to draw together a thousand\r\npersons, and sometimes more, it seems to be going beyond a reasonable\r\nnumber, and has somewhat the appearance of ambitious largesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXVIII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nYou very justly apprehended that those public invitations which extend\r\nto an immoderate number of people, and where the dole is distributed,\r\nnot singly to a few acquaintances, but, as it were, to whole collective\r\nbodies, may be turned to the factious purposes of ambition. But I\r\nappointed you to your present government, fully relying upon your\r\nprudence, and in the persuasion that you would take proper measures for\r\nregulating the manners and settling the peace of the province.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXIX -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nTHE athletic victors, Sir, in the Iselastic[1076] games, conceive that\r\nthe stipend you have established for the conquerors becomes due from the\r\nday they are crowned: for it is not at all material, they say, what time\r\nthey were triumphantly conducted into their country, but when they\r\nmerited that honour. On the contrary, when I consider the meaning of the\r\nterm Iselastic, I am strongly inclined to think that it is intended the\r\nstipend should commence from the time of their public entry. They\r\nlikewise petition to be allowed the treat you give at those combats\r\nwhich you have converted into Iselastic, though they were conquerors\r\nbefore the appointment of that institution: for it is but reasonable,\r\nthey assert, that they should receive the reward in this instance, as\r\nthey are deprived of it at those games which have been divested of the\r\nhonour of being Iselastic, since their victory. But I am very doubtful,\r\nwhether a retrospect should be admitted in the case in question, and a\r\nreward given, to which the claimants had no right at the time they\r\nobtained the victory. I beg, therefore, you would be pleased to direct\r\nmy judgment in these points, by explaining the intention of your own\r\nbenefactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXX -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nTHE stipend appointed for the conqueror in the Iselastic games ought\r\nnot, I think, to commence till he makes his triumphant entry into his\r\ncity. Nor are the prizes, at those combats which I thought proper to\r\nmake Iselastic, to be extended backwards to those who were victors\r\nbefore that alteration took place. With regard to the plea which these\r\nathletic combatants urge, that they ought to receive the Iselastic prize\r\nat those combats which have been made Iselastic subsequent to their\r\nconquests, as they are denied it in the same case where the games have\r\nceased to be so, it proves nothing in their favour; for notwithstanding\r\nany new arrangements which has been made relating to these games, they\r\nare not called upon to return the recompense which they received prior\r\nto such alteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXI -- To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN\r\n\r\nI HAVE hitherto never, Sir, granted an order for post-chaises to any\r\nperson, or upon any occasion, but in affairs that relate to your\r\nadministration. I find myself, however, at present under a sort of\r\nnecessity of breaking through this fixed rule. My wife having received\r\nan account of her grandfather's death, and being desirous to wait upon\r\nher aunt with all possible expedition, I thought it would be unkind to\r\ndeny her the use of this privilege; as the grace of so tender an office\r\nconsists in the early discharge of it, and as I well knew a journey\r\nwhich was founded in filial piety could not fail of your approbation. I\r\nshould think myself highly ungrateful therefore, were I not to\r\nacknowledge that, among other great obligations which I owe to your\r\nindulgence, I have this in particular, that, in confidence of your\r\nfavour, I have ventured to do, without consulting you, what would have\r\nbeen too late had I waited for your consent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXII -- TRAJAN TO PLINY\r\n\r\nYou did me justice, my dearest Secundus, in confiding in my affection\r\ntowards you. Without doubt, if you had waited for my consent to forward\r\nyour wife in her journey by means of those warrants which I have\r\nentrusted to your care, the use of them would not have answered your\r\npurpose; since it was proper this visit to her aunt should have the\r\nadditional recommendation of being paid with all possible expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES TO THE CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE EMPEROR TRAJAN 1001 (return) [\r\nThe greater part of the following letters were written by Pliny during\r\nhis administration in the province of Bithynia. They are of a style and\r\ncharacter extremely different from those in the preceding collection;\r\nwhence some critics have injudiciously inferred that they are the\r\nproduction of another hand: not considering that the occasion\r\nnecessarily required a different manner. In letters of business, as\r\nthese chiefly are, turn and sentiment would be foreign and impertinent;\r\npoliteness and elegance of expression being the essentials that\r\nconstitute perfection in this kind: and in that view, though they may be\r\nless entertaining, they have not less merit than the former. But besides\r\ntheir particular excellence as letters, they have a farther\r\nrecommendation as so many valuable pieces of history, by throwing a\r\nstrong light upon the character of one of the most amiable and glorious\r\nprinces in the Roman annals. Trajan appears throughout in the most\r\nstriking attitude that majesty can be placed in; in the exertion of\r\npower to the godlike purposes of justice and benevolence: and what one\r\nof the ancient historians has said of him is here clearly verified, that\r\n\"he rather chose to be loved than flattered by his people.\" To have been\r\ndistinguished by the favour and friendship of a monarch of so exalted a\r\ncharacter is an honour that reflects the brightest lustre upon our\r\nauthor; as to have been served and celebrated by a courtier of Pliny's\r\ngenius and virtues is the noblest monunient of glory that could have\r\nbeen raised to Trajan.

On the other hand, if it was expressly\r\ngranted him, his children could not preserve their right of patronage\r\nover their own freedmen, because that right would of course devolve to\r\ntheir father, by means of this acquired dominion over them.

M.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1028 (return) [ Slaves who were purchased by the public. M.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1029 (return) [ The most probable conjecture (for it is a point of a\r\ngood deal of obscurity) concerning the beneficiary seems to be that they\r\nwere a certain number of soldiers exempted from the usual duty of their\r\noffice, in order to be employed as a sort of body-guards to the general.\r\nThese were probably foot; as the equites here mentioned were perhaps of\r\nthe same nature, only that they served on horseback. Equites singulares\r\nCæsaris Augusti, &c., are frequently met with upon ancient inscriptions,\r\nand are generally supposed to mean the bodyguards of the emperor.

However, upon cases\r\nof great necessity, this maxim was dispensed with; but then they were\r\nfirst made free before they were received into the army, excepting only\r\n(as Servius in his notes upon Virgil) observes after the fatal battle of\r\nCannae; when the public distress was so great that the Romans recruited\r\ntheir army with their slaves, though they had not time to give them\r\ntheir freedom. One reason, perhaps, of this policy might be that they\r\ndid not think it safe to arm so considerable a body of men, whose\r\nnumbers, in the times when the Roman luxury was at its highest, we may\r\nhave some idea of by the instance which Pun the naturalist mentions of\r\nClaudius Isodorus, who at the time of his death was possessed of no less\r\nthan 4,116 slaves, notwithstanding he had lost great numbers in the\r\ncivil wars.

M.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1033 (return) [ It has been generally imagined that the ancients had not\r\nthe art of raising water by engines; but this passage seems to favour\r\nthe contrary opinion. The word in the original is sipho, which Hesychius\r\nexplains (as one of the commentators observes) \"instrumentuns ad\r\njaculandas aquas adversas incendia; an instrument to throw up water\r\nagainst fires.\" But there is a passage in Seneca which seems to put this\r\nmatter beyond conjecture, though none of the critics upon this place\r\nhave taken notice of it: \"Solemiss,\" says he, \"duabus manibus inter se\r\njunctis aguam concipere, et com pressa utrinque palma in modum ciphonis\r\nexprimere\" (Q. N. 1. II. 16) where we plainly see the use of this sipho\r\nwas to throw UP water, and consequently the Romans were acquainted with\r\nthat art.

To those who are not acquainted with the\r\nimmense riches of the ancients, it may seem incredible that a city, and\r\nnot the capital one either, of a conquered province should expend so\r\nlarge a sum of money upon only the shell (as it appears to be) of a\r\ntheatre: but Asia was esteemed the most considerable part of the world\r\nfor wealth; its fertility and exportations (as Tully observes) exceeding\r\nthat of all other countries. M.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1038 (return) [ The word carte, in the original, comprehends more than\r\nwhat we call the pit in our theatres, as at means the whole space lit\r\nwhich the spectators sat.

M.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1043b (return) [ These, in the original institution as settled by\r\nAugustus, were only commanders of his body-guards; but in the later\r\ntimes of the Roman empire they were next in authority under the emperor,\r\nto whom they seem to have acted as a sort of prime ministers. M.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1044b (return) [ The provinces were divided into, a kind of circuits\r\ncalled conventus, whither the proconsuls used to go in order to\r\nadminister justice.

The provinciae Cæsaris, or imperial\r\nprovinces, were such as the emperor, for reasons of policy, reserved to\r\nhis own immediate administration, or of those whom he thought proper to\r\nappoint: the provinciae senatus, or proconsular provinces, were such as\r\nhe left to the government of proconsuls or praetors, chosen in the\r\nordinary method of election. (Vid. Suet, in Aug. V. 47.) Of the former\r\nkind was Bithynis, at the time when our author presided there. (Vid.\r\nMasson. Vit. Plin. p. 133.)

(Vid. Pot. Antiq. V. II. 181.) From some\r\nsuch opinion as this it is probable that the circumstance, here\r\nmentioned, of placing Trajan's statue where these bodies were deposited,\r\nwas esteemed as a mark of disrespect to his person.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1062 (return) [ A thriving Greek colony in the territory of Sinopis, on\r\nthe Euxine.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1063 (return) [ A colony of Athenians in the province of Pontus.

M.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1067 (return) [ It was one of the privileges of a Roman citizen, secured\r\nby the Semprorian law, that he could not be capitally convicted but by\r\nthe suffrage of the people; which seems to have been still so far in\r\nforce as to make it necessary to send the persons here mentioned to\r\nRome. M.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1068 (return) [ These women, it is supposed, exercised the same office\r\nas Phoebe mentioned by St. Paul, whom he styles deaconess of the church\r\nof Cenchrea.

M.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1069 (return) [ If we impartially examine this prosecution of the\r\nChristians, we shall find it to have been grounded on the ancient\r\nconstitution of the state, and not to have proceeded from a cruel or\r\narbitrary temper in Trajan. The Roman legislature appears to have been\r\nearly jealous of any innovation in point of public worship; and we find\r\nthe magistrates, during the old republic frequently interposing in cases\r\nof that nature. Valerius Maximus has collected some instances to that\r\npurpose (L. I. C. 3), and Livy mentions it as an established principle\r\nof the earlier ages of the commonwealth, to guard against the\r\nintroduction of foreign ceremonies of religion. It was an old and fixed\r\nmaxim likewise of the Roman government not to suffer any unlicensed\r\nassemblies of the people. From hence it seems evident that the\r\nChristians had rendered themselves obnoxious not so much to Trajan as to\r\nthe ancient and settled laws of the state, by introducing a foreign\r\nworship, and assembling themselves without authority.
