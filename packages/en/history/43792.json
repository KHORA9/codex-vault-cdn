\"style\" in modern art, and to\r\n  prove the logic of its evolution, the principles of judgment in the\r\n  old art-histories are also to be employed for the new.--The\r\n  question is, what new element the age brought into the history of\r\n  art, not what it borrowed eclectically from earlier ages             1\r\n\r\nBOOK I\r\n\r\n  THE LEGACY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\nCHAPTER

sincere art\r\n  succeeds throughout the whole of Europe.--Return to what Dürer and\r\n  the Little Masters of the sixteenth century and the Dutch of the\r\n  seventeenth century originated

undertakes the art of an earlier period. The greatest difficulty\r\nwith which the latter has to cope is the deficiency of sources. He\r\nmanifestly gropes in the dark with regard to the works of the masters as\r\nwell as to the circumstances of their lives. After he has searched\r\narchives and libraries in order to collect his biographical material,\r\nthe real critical problem awaits him. Even amongst the admittedly\r\nauthentic works, those which are undated confront those whose chronology\r\nis certain. To these must be added those nameless ones, as to whose\r\nhistory there is a doubt; to these again, those whose origin is to be\r\nascertained. It needs a quick eye to separate the schools and groups,\r\nand finally to recognise the notes which are peculiar to the master.\r\n\r\nWith none of these difficulties is the historian of modern art\r\nconfronted. The painters of the nineteenth century have very seldom\r\nforgotten to attach a name and date to their works, and the\r\ncircumstances of their lives are related with an accuracy that was,\r\nearlier, rarely the lot of the foremost men in history. It is all the\r\nmore difficult, face to face with such a chaos of pictures, to discover\r\nthe spiritual bond which connects them all, to construct a building out\r\nof the immense supply of accumulated bricks, the piled-up mass of rough\r\nmaterial. The evolution of modern painting is more complicated and\r\nvaried than that of the art of an earlier period, just as modern life\r\nitself is more complicated and varied than that of any previous age.\r\n\r\nHow quietly, slowly, and surely was the evolution of that older period\r\ncarried out. One simple proportion was maintained between art and the\r\nuniversal life of culture. Customs, views of life and art, were so\r\nintimately bound up together, that the knowledge of the age in general\r\nnaturally comprises that of art. Standing before some old altar-piece of\r\nthe school of Cologne, it is as though one were watching in some broad\r\nhigh dome; everything is quiet all round, and the august figures in the\r\npicture lead their calm, grave existence in illustrious grandeur. The\r\nmessage of Christianity, \"My kingdom is not of this world,\" meets in\r\nart, too, with a clear expression. Humility and devotion are joined\r\ntogether, making for a refinement in the feeling of life that is\r\nunsurpassed in its hieratic tenderness and gracious innocence. In the\r\nfifteenth century, the age of discoveries, a new spirit entered the\r\nworld. Commerce and navigation discovered new worlds, painting\r\ndiscovered life. The human spirit grew freer and more joyous; it was no\r\nlonger satisfied with yearning for the other world alone, it felt itself\r\nat home also in this world, in the glory of the earth. Pictures, too,\r\nwere inspired with some of those joyous perceptions with which the\r\ncitizens of the fifteenth century issued from their narrow walls out\r\nunder God's free heaven, something of that Easter Day mood in _Faust_.\r\nPeople still went on painting Madonnas and saints, subjects of a\r\nreligion which had spread from the far East over the whole West; but\r\nwith the severe simplicity of the heavenly, there was universal\r\nawakening of all the charm and roguery and energy of the earthly. It is\r\nthe first virginal contact of the spirit with nature. On men's works\r\nthere rests the first morning-dew of spiritual life; they remind one of\r\nwoodlands in spring: Botticelli, Van Eyck, Schongauer.\r\n\r\nAfter the Italians had become vigorous realists in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, they rose in the sixteenth, the century of inspired humanism,\r\nto majesty. The time of hard grappling with the overwhelming fulness of\r\nactuality is over. Those great masterpieces ensue in which the\r\nunlaboured effort shines forth in the most felicitous achievement:\r\nRaphael, Michael Angelo, Titian. At the same time the German manner is\r\nmost directly opposed to the Romance. They disdain to ingratiate\r\nthemselves into men's minds by outward grace of form, but win the heart\r\nby their deep religious feeling and intimate sensibility. They are\r\nGerman to the core, racial even to the stiffness of the German\r\ncharacter, but full of feeling and truth to life. Dürer in his woodcuts\r\nand copper engravings is \"_inwendig voller figur_\"; in them he offers\r\nthe \"concentrated, homely treasure of his heart.\" Holbein is great by\r\nthe incomparably real art of his portraits. The century of that joyous\r\nrevival of Paganism, the Olympian vivacity of the Renaissance, is\r\nfollowed by the age to which the Jesuits gave life and character. For\r\nthose stately churches in the Jesuit style, with their _fortissimo_\r\neffect, their huge, sculptured ornaments and their gleaming, gold\r\ndecorations, the classic quietness of the old masters ceases to be\r\nappropriate. It is a question of a more stirring and impressive\r\ntreatment of sacred subjects, wherein the whole passion of renewed\r\nCatholicism should be brought to expression. Spain, the country of the\r\nInquisition, set the classic stamp on this enhanced religious feeling.\r\nHere all that monarchical and sacerdotal impulse which founded and\r\naggrandised the Spanish nation, founded too its true representative in\r\npainting. Painters endowed their church pictures with a passionate\r\nfervour and a flush of extravagant sensuousness of the national,\r\nSpanish, local colour, such as are found united in the art of no other\r\nage or country. Necessarily, moreover, such a feudal system as that of\r\nSpain, with its grandees and princes of the Church, involved also an art\r\nof portrait painting which ranks with the highest that has issued in\r\nthis kind from any country whatever: Murillo, Velasquez. In Flanders,\r\nthe second stronghold of the Jesuits, we have the titan Rubens. A\r\njoyously fleshly Fleming, he seizes nature by the throat and drags her\r\nthere where he stands erect, as though he were lord of the world.\r\nFreedom had found its way into victorious and Protestant Holland. Here\r\nthere flourished an art neither courtly nor fostered by the Church. It\r\nstood in the closest connection with the burgesses, showed clear signs\r\nof the struggle through which country and people had won independence.\r\nIn the first place, painting celebrated as its worthiest subject the\r\nfree burgher, the tighter in the heroic struggle for freedom. At no time\r\nwas portrait-painting practised to such an extent, and the sitters not\r\naristocratic courtiers, but proud burgesses of a free community; the men\r\ngrave, strong, self-reliant; the women faithful, pure, and modest. The\r\nworkmanship is correspondent: simple, solid, domestic; and soon there\r\nfollowed the glorification of that which they prized the more after\r\ntheir struggles had been accomplished: the quiet, comfortable delight of\r\nhearth and home.\r\n\r\nDuring the War of Independence the Dutch had learnt to love their\r\nfatherland, and they were the first, as artists, fully to grasp the\r\npoetry of landscape. Art now no longer shines only upon the eyes of Mary\r\nand the Hosts of Heaven: it settles upon arid country hills, streams\r\nupon the sea waves, is at home in peasants' houses and the dark woods,\r\nwanders through the streets and alleys, makes a temple of every market.\r\nThe religious sentiments, however, which stirred Protestant Holland had\r\nto find appropriate expression; the living essence of biblical subjects\r\nwas to be released from a narrow, ecclesiastical sphere, and approached\r\nanew with all the deep, German inwardness. These tendencies were all\r\nunited in Rembrandt--perhaps of all masters, since the Christian era,\r\nthe mightiest proclaimer of the great Pan; to him the cosmic powers of\r\nlight and air signified the divinity that Michael Angelo had painted\r\nunder a beautiful human form.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the eighteenth century, comes _rococo_, with its rustling\r\n_frou-frou_ and its delicate charm. The whole life of that noble\r\nsociety, which exchanged court costume for silken pastoral garments,\r\nformality and rank for charm and grace, was a lively play, an\r\nextravagant game. The king played with his crown, the priest with his\r\nreligion, the philosopher with his wisdom, the poet with the art of\r\nrhyme. They did not hear as yet the hoarse threatening voice of the\r\ndisinherited, \"_Car tel est notre plaisir_.\" What this age possessed of\r\nbeauty and charm, its peculiar grace and wanton vivacity, its reckless,\r\ninassailable frivolity, was proper also to its art. Light and gracious\r\nas the whole life of that harmless, merry generation, it glided through\r\nthe age untroubled, led by Cupidons, and kissed by the wandering winds.\r\nIt is only to-day that we understand once more the charming masters of\r\nthat elegant century.\r\n\r\nThe painters of every epoch looked at nature with their own eyes, and\r\nalso with the eyes of their age and of their country. So the art of\r\nevery period appears as \"the mirror and abstract chronicle\" of its age.\r\nWith irresistible majesty, and conscious of its inspiration, it lays\r\nhold of the external world, and gives back to it its own picture\r\ninfinitely exalted. It is the enlightened expression of the age, as\r\nupright, as fresh, as fanatic, or as unnatural as its generation.\r\nTherein lies the strength of the painters of _rococo_, that they painted\r\nthe artificiality of the time with such unsurpassable naturalness. It is\r\njust these infinitely various manners of paying court to\r\nnature--unceasingly throughout the course of centuries, now violently,\r\nnow softly and tenderly, at times, too, not without passing\r\ninfidelity,--it is just these which determine the beauty and value, the\r\nmystery and essence of art, and are in the history of art all that tends\r\nto its variety and unsurpassable charm.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century not only shows a new age, but probably begins a\r\nnew section of universal history. It is probable that in contrast with\r\nthis epoch of stirring movement, during which the readjustment of all\r\npolitical and social relations, the new discoveries in the instruments\r\nof commerce, trade, and industry have given an entirely new aspect to\r\nthe world, the next thousand years will sum up all the previous\r\ncenturies as the \"old world.\" New men require a new art. One would be\r\ninclined to surmise from this that the art of the nineteenth century\r\npresented itself as something essentially personal, with a sharply\r\ndistinctive style. Instead of this it offers at first view, in contrast\r\nwith those old ages of uniform production, a condition like that of\r\nBabylon. The nineteenth century has no style--the phrase that has been\r\nso often quoted as to have become a commonplace. In architecture the\r\nforms of all the past ages live again. The day before yesterday we built\r\nGreek, yesterday Gothic; here _Baroque_, there Japanese: but amidst all\r\nthese products of imitative styles there rise up stations and\r\nmarket-places which, with the robust elegance of their iron colonnades,\r\nherald the greatness of fresh conquests. In the province of painting\r\nthere are similar extremes. In no other age have minds so diverse\r\nflourished side by side as Carstens and Goya, Cornelius and Corot,\r\nIngres and Millet, Wiertz and Courbet, Rossetti and Manet. And the\r\nexisting histories excite a belief that the nineteenth century is a\r\nchaos into which it is possible only for some later age to bring order.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, it is already quite possible, if one only resolves\r\nuncompromisingly to apply to the new age those principles which have\r\nbeen tested in the treatment of the _old_ histories of art, if one\r\nendeavours to study those artists who are in part still our\r\ncontemporaries as objectively as though they were masters long dead.\r\nThat is to say: one is wont, in a review of an older period in art, not\r\nto inquire what it had caught from an earlier age, but rather what it\r\nhad introduced that was new. It was not because they imitated in their\r\nturn that the old masters became great; not because they looked\r\nbackwards, but rather because they went forwards, that they made the\r\nhistory of art. We are not grateful, for instance, to the Dutchmen of\r\nthe middle of the sixteenth century--Frans Floris and his\r\ncontemporaries--that they forsook Dutch naturalism, and bootlessly\r\nexerted themselves in the way of Michael Angelo and Raphael. We can see\r\nno remarkable merit in the fact that the Bolognese at the beginning of\r\nthe seventeenth century gathered their honey from the flowers of the\r\nCinquecento. And we are even less inclined to see in the contemporaries\r\nof Adrian van der Werff, who endeavoured to refine the rugged, primeval\r\nDutch art by the study of the Italians, more than clumsy imitators.\r\n\r\nJust as much will the interest of the historian of the art of the\r\nnineteenth century be bestowed in the first degree upon the works which\r\nhave really created something independent and transcending all the\r\nearlier ages. He will not give especial prominence to those domains\r\nwhich had their flowering-time in other days than our own, but he will\r\nask: Where is that distinctive element which appertains to the\r\nnineteenth century only? What are the new forms which it has found, the\r\nnew sentiments to which it has given expression? Not those whose\r\nactivity lay in clothing--however cleverly--the artistic necessities of\r\nthe age in the store of already transmitted forms, but the pathfinders,\r\nwho went forwards and created anew, require our attention. Even if,\r\nafter the old masters, they can only be granted a place in the third or\r\nfourth class, they must nevertheless always take precedence of those\r\nothers, because they exhibited themselves as they were, instead of\r\nmaking themselves large by standing on the shoulders of the dead. Many\r\nof those who were once valued highly, who, thriving on the inheritance\r\nof the past, accomplished what was apparently of importance, measured by\r\nthis standard will arouse little interest, because their artistic\r\nspeech, depending on a foundation of the established canonical works of\r\nold, is not their own but borrowed. In others, on the contrary, who,\r\napart from the dominating tendency, had the courage rather to be\r\ninsignificant, and yet remain themselves, observing with their own eyes\r\nnature which surrounded them, or naïvely abandoning themselves to the\r\ndisposition of their artistic fantasy, in them will be seen the\r\nessential vehicles of the modern spirit. And then it will be apparent\r\nthat the art of the nineteenth century as well as that of every earlier\r\nperiod had its peculiar garment, even if for official occasions it\r\npreferred to unpack from its wardrobe the state costumes of earlier\r\nages. It is only because this distinction between the eclectic and the\r\npersonal, the derived and the independent, has not yet been carried out\r\nwith sufficient strictness, that it has hitherto, in my opinion, been\r\nfound so difficult to discover the distinctive _style_ of modern art,\r\nand to make clear the logic and sequence of its evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I\r\n\r\nTHE LEGACY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nCOMMENCEMENT OF MODERN ART IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the question arises, why modern art has been compelled to find\r\nexpression for itself in a form different from that of the art of the\r\nearlier centuries, we must first call attention to the change that has\r\ntaken place in the fundamental conditions of society. Formerly, the\r\nchief supporters of art were the two leading powers of Church and King.\r\nThe most noted works of Raphael and Michael Angelo, of Velasquez and\r\nMurillo, of Rubens and Van Dyck, were executed either for the churches\r\nor for the reigning princes of their country. The patron of modern art\r\nis the citizen. The old culture of the clerics and aristocrats has been\r\nsuperseded by that of the middle classes, and the beginnings of modern\r\nart must therefore be sought in the country in which this class first\r\ndeveloped its distinctive character--in England.\r\n\r\nEngland, as early as the eighteenth century, was already a land of\r\ncitizens. At a time when there was to be found on the Continent acute\r\nmockery of what was old and outworn, conjoined with the most\r\nenthusiastic and joyous faith in the future, the great and wealthy\r\nEngland had established herself in the van of the new age. Here Voltaire\r\nsaw with astonishment for the first time, when he arrived in London as\r\nan exile at the age of thirty-two, the free, open life of a great\r\npeople; here he learnt to know a country where there is \"much difference\r\nof rank, but none that is not based on merit; where one could think\r\nfreely without being restrained by slavish terror.\" Here was the idea of\r\na modern free state already accomplished at a time when, upon the\r\nContinent, the thunderclouds of the impending storm hardly cast their\r\nfirst shadow. Here the notion of a united family life had first\r\ndeveloped, upon the foundation of a civil order and security. Here,\r\ntherefore, were first broken down those barriers around the territory of\r\nliterature and art within which the spirit of the Renaissance had raised\r\nits wonderful flowers, and the road was begun along which the nineteenth\r\ncentury should advance.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the growth of the middle classes there arose the\r\nneed for a domestic, practical literature. Books were required which\r\npeople could read by their fireside, in the seclusion of the family\r\ncircle, in country districts. For that, the stiff and antiquated poetry\r\nof courtiers and academicians, which had hitherto been poured out upon\r\nthe world from France, was hardly suitable.\r\n\r\nTo the cold Classicism represented by Pope, there succeeded in English\r\nliterature--far earlier than was the case elsewhere--the delineation of\r\nwhat was immediately contemporary. At the same time that Mdlle. de\r\nScudéry--when it was a question of describing the court of the Great\r\nKing, the society of Louis XIV--felt herself bound to translate her\r\ntheme into the antique and write a _Cyrus_, the English novel had taken\r\nits motives from actual life. Defoe's _Robinson Crusoe_ is the first\r\nbook in which man and nature are depicted without the introduction of\r\nantique types or fairies; the first novel in which the details of real\r\nlife are displayed, and what had been hitherto neglected is granted an\r\nexact delineation. At a time when people in other countries were\r\noccupied with representations of the antique, the English novelists had\r\nembarked on the intimacy of the family circle. After Richardson, who\r\nlaboriously yet with animation described everyday life, followed\r\nFielding, with his sharp observation, homely and humorous; then\r\nGoldsmith, with his serene outlook of untroubled equanimity, his\r\nunsurpassed miniatures; Smollett, with his crude and satirical character\r\nsketching; and the audacious and witty Laurence Sterne, whom Nietzsche\r\nhas called the most \"gallant\" of all authors. At the same time tragedy,\r\ntoo, descended from the court and the nobility into the sphere of\r\ndomestic life; showing that here too were significant fortunes and\r\nconflicts, which stories strike a truer human note than those of kings\r\nand heroes.\r\n\r\nPainting moved along the same road; and whilst in other countries, with\r\nthe beginning of the century, the high, aristocratic art, which was the\r\noffspring of the Renaissance, gradually waned, the plebeian paintings of\r\nHogarth laid the foundations of that art which prevailed in the\r\n_bourgeois_ nineteenth century. English art had this advantage in\r\nplaying a pioneering part, that it had no old traditions to stand in its\r\nway; it had no great past. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\r\nEngland had been content to offer hospitality to Holbein and Van Dyck,\r\nand to collect the works of foreign masters in her galleries. Her art\r\nsprang into existence suddenly and unexpectedly at the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century, and thence developed exclusively on native lines.\r\nSince the English could not lean either upon an old or a foreign model,\r\nnor enter into a round of subjects that had already been brought to\r\nperfection, they turned from the outset quite naturally into the road\r\nwhich was only to be trodden later by the other nations still in the\r\nbondage of tradition. They took up, to a certain extent, the thread\r\nwhich the Dutch, who appeared in the seventeenth century as the most\r\nmodern people in art, had let drop: the progressive ideas of Holland had\r\ncome over to England with the \"glorious revolution,\" with William of\r\nOrange and Queen Anne; whilst in Holland itself the French invasion of\r\n1672 had caused a reaction to the courtly idea, against which the\r\nEnglish took up an attitude of conscious and rigid protest. This\r\nopposition is clearly expressed by the English æsthetic writers.\r\n\r\nThe most important name to be mentioned is that of Shaftesbury. Beneath\r\nthe favour of the court in France, he says, art has suffered. We\r\nEnglishmen live in an age in which freedom has arisen. Such a people\r\ndoes not require, in order that art may prosper, an ambitious king to\r\nbreed, by means of his pensions, a race of flattering Court painters.\r\nOur civil liberty affords us a sufficient foundation, and our liberty\r\nleads us to _absolute verity_ in art.\r\n\r\nThus did Shaftesbury enunciate his leading æsthetic doctrine; it was his\r\nconstant message, and it was constantly repeated with great emphasis:\r\n\"All beauty is truth.\" \"The search after truth leads you to nature.\"\r\n\"Truth is the mightiest thing in the world, since it exercises sovereign\r\nrights over the creations of the imagination.\"\r\n\r\nBut what must art be in order to produce truth? \"The strictest imitation\r\nof nature.\" By this word Shaftesbury does not understand what we\r\nunderstand by the word \"nature\"; not, in the first instance, so much the\r\nnature surrounding us, in its outward manifestations, but, above all, an\r\nintimate human reality. Let the painter represent the reality of human\r\n_inwardness_. Still life, the animal world, landscape,--all that,\r\nShaftesbury explains, is most valuable. But another and a higher life\r\nexists in man than in the beasts and the woods, and there is the true\r\nobject of art. In no case should the artist proceed from external\r\nvision; for then he will obtain fashionable attitudes, theatrical\r\nunreality, or, in the most favourable instance, a formal, decorative\r\nembellishment. Of what value is that in comparison with a single real\r\npresentation of character? How insignificant would every external form\r\nseem in contrast to each single feature of this intimate manner! Here is\r\nthe second characteristic of English painting. It proceeds neither, like\r\nthat of the sixteenth century, from formulas, nor, like the Dutch, from\r\nthe picturesque, but, like to the English novel of character, from an\r\nintellectual impulse; it strives not after beauty of form and physical,\r\nsensuous grace, but, in the first place, after intellectual expression.\r\n\r\nAnd from this there follows immediately a third trait. If art is to make\r\nthe inwardness of man its subject, the artist cannot remain an\r\nindifferent portrayer. He will make great distinctions, will bring into\r\nprominence what is meritorious or censurable in every character--he will\r\nbecome a moralist. Only so can he conform to that last and highest\r\nfunction which Shaftesbury assigns to the painter.\r\n\r\nThe liberty which the English nation had fought for in the \"glorious\r\nRevolution\" brought forth, in the course of years, while Shaftesbury was\r\nwriting, a fruitful crop of dissoluteness and licence. The mortification\r\nof the flesh of the Puritans was followed by so violent a recrudescence\r\nof sensuality that it was as though the whole menagerie of the passions\r\nhad been unchained. London swarmed with criminals; drunkenness was an\r\nepidemic. The moral idea awoke amongst the cultivated classes. Might it\r\nnot be possible, with the help of education, for that to be overcome?\r\nAnd so Shaftesbury's view of art comprised a third, and very dangerous,\r\nelement; namely, that to fulfil the most serious mission of that culture\r\nwhich had ensued from the free and natural conditions in England--even\r\nin the realm of æsthetics--the painter, like the poet, must appear as\r\nthe moral teacher of his age. Imagine an artist who fulfils these\r\nconditions and you have, as a result, _Hogarth_, with all his qualities\r\nand defects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOGARTH.   PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF.]\r\n\r\nWhat marks the greatness of Hogarth is his freedom from foreign and\r\nancient influences. The eighteenth century came in as an academic age in\r\nart. Turning away from life, it spent itself in allegory and the\r\nimitation of typical figures that had been inherited from the\r\nRenaissance and petrified into academic work. Gods, in whom no one any\r\nlonger believed, hovered, at least in paint, over a race which was\r\nwithout enthusiasm. Then came Hogarth, and his quick vision discovered\r\nthe new way. He looked out upon the life surrounding him, with its\r\nmanifold idiosyncrasies, and felt himself with pride to be the son of a\r\nnew age, in which rigid, conventional forms were everywhere penetrated\r\nby the modern ideas of free thought, the rights of man, conformity to\r\nnature in morals and manners. This world which confronted him he\r\ndepicted truly as it was, in all its beauty and its ugliness. With him\r\nwas the origin of modern art. Before his paintings and engravings pale\r\nidealism disappeared. It was he who resolved and set out to bring into\r\nthe world a new and independent observation of life. He was a painter\r\nwho, with as little aid from foreign influences as from those of the\r\npast, went his own way and kept to it, and devoted his art, unblemished\r\nby the pallor of a borrowed ideal of beauty, soberly and exclusively to\r\nthe realities of surrounding life.\r\n\r\n\"It seemed to me unlikely,\" writes he, \"that by copying old compositions\r\nI could acquire facility for those new designs which were my first and\r\ngreatest ambitions.\" Works of old Italian masters, artistic\r\ncontemplations, which went back to Raphael and the Caracci, were\r\nignored and ridiculed by him. His rude strength of painting, directed to\r\nthe living truth, was a protest against all that idealism which was the\r\nheritage of the Renaissance, and had grown quite bombastic under the\r\nhands of its imitators. Nature, he writes, is simple, plain, and true in\r\nall her works; and with this principle he has founded a strong English\r\nschool on the solid foundation of truth to nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOGARTH.   THE HARLOT'S PROGRESS, PLATE VI.]\r\n\r\nAn Englishman by birth, character, and disposition, he depicted his\r\nfellow-countrymen; he made his sketches in the midst of the hubbub of\r\nthe street. His world is London, the world-city, \"old merry England,\"\r\nwhich, in contrast with the Puritanism of to-day, still lived through\r\nits golden age of riot. In such a world--a world existing to this day,\r\nonly more decently berouged--moved Hogarth; in the company of\r\nwine-bibbers, in gambling hells, in rooms of poets, in cellars of\r\nhighwaymen, in the death-chambers of fallen maidens. \"The Harlot's\r\nProgress,\" which he produced in a series of pictures, brought him his\r\nfirst success. He then published further series of similar careers over\r\ncrooked courses--\"The Rake's Progress,\" \"Marriage à la Mode.\" He painted\r\nthe rabble of London, their society and their morals; those who went in\r\ncotton and rags and those in satin and silk. In his writings he censures\r\nthe old painters plainly because in their historical style they had\r\nquite passed over the middle classes. And he went with great knowledge\r\nto these new subjects. In the National Gallery, which possesses the\r\noriginals of \"Marriage à la Mode,\" one is astounded at the technical\r\nqualities of Hogarth's painting. Whoever has been misled by the engraved\r\nreproductions, and looks for bad, distorted drawing, may here learn to\r\nknow him as a painter in the fullest sense of the word. There is no sign\r\nleft of the defective caricature which disfigures the engravings; there\r\nis a severe, unadorned manifestation of realism, of an art that has from\r\nthe outset rooted itself in modern life. Under the manners and graces of\r\nthe age Hogarth stands a \"self-made\" man, a healthy Anglo-Saxon\r\npersonality, full of sturdy independence and impeccable common sense. He\r\nattracts by a sharpness of observation, a penetration into\r\nidiosyncrasies of character, a grip upon the most trivial changes in\r\nmen's emotions and play of features, the like of which is to be found in\r\nhardly one of his predecessors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOGARTH.   THE RAKE'S PROGRESS, PLATE II.]\r\n\r\nAgainst these qualities it must be understood that an equal number of\r\ndefects is to be set off. The inartistic part of him was that he\r\nfollowed the æsthetic theories of the age, and looked upon art as merely\r\na means to ends alien to itself. With him painting was an instrument to\r\ndisseminate the inventions of his poetic-satiric humour; it was a form\r\nof speech to him. He is not unjustly called on that account a comedian\r\nof the pencil, the Molière of painting. We look at other pictures, but\r\nhis we read. The commentaries on them are in some respects the rendering\r\nback of the pictures into their proper element. Lessing called the drama\r\nhis pulpit; with Hogarth his art was a pulpit. He wanted, like Hamlet,\r\nto \"hold the mirror up to nature, to show virtue her own feature, scorn\r\nher own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and\r\npressure.\" Pictures beneath his hands became moral sermons.\r\n\r\nIn the six pictures in \"The Harlot's Progress,\" with which he started in\r\n1733, and which to-day, since the originals have perished, can be\r\nconsidered only in the copper engravings after them, all these\r\nattributes are recognisable. Mary Hackabout comes innocent from the\r\ncountry to the town with the intention of seeking a situation as a\r\nservant-girl. She speedily falls a victim to temptation, becomes the\r\nmistress of a Jewish banker, whom she soon loses by her infidelity,\r\ndescends to be a thief, and comes to the work-house. Released from\r\nthere, she becomes the companion of a highwayman, until she ends her\r\npitiful life in a disorderly house, leaving behind her a poor crippled\r\nboy, who, at his mother's funeral, is playing with a top. The conclusion\r\nof the paintings shows how the other women bid farewell to the corpse,\r\nand buoy themselves up for their coming pleasures by drinking from the\r\nspirit bottle, which stands on the coffin, while the priest, who is come\r\nto give the blessing, announces his visit for the evening.\r\n\r\nThe second series, which is to be seen to-day in the Soane Museum,\r\ndescribes in eight tableaux the somewhat similar life of a young man,\r\nthe \"Rake.\" As an Oxford student he has promised marriage to a pretty\r\nbut poor girl, when suddenly the death of a wealthy uncle throws him\r\ninto the vortex of London life. He wishes to buy himself freedom from\r\nhis sweetheart, but she disdainfully refuses the money and supports\r\nherself and her child honestly with the labour of her hands. The\r\nseducer, winning fame in the world of women and sport, rapidly paces the\r\nroad to ruin; yet he repairs his finances once again by a marriage with\r\na rich and one-eyed old lady. Once more on his feet, he flings himself\r\ninto games of chance, and comes to the sponging-house, whither his\r\nbetter half follows him. It is the last straw when a play which he has\r\noffered to a manager is refused, and he can no longer buy himself a pint\r\nof ale; there remains only the final fall into the misery of frenzy, and\r\nin the last picture we find him amongst the lunatics bound in chains as\r\na madman. Only his student love, Sarah Young, of Oxford, whom he had\r\ntreated so scurvily, cannot forget him, and, with tears, seeks him out\r\nagain in the madhouse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOGARTH.   THE RAKE'S PROGRESS, PLATE VII.]\r\n\r\nThe third and most famous series was completed many years after the\r\n\"Rake\"--in 1745. Hogarth has admittedly taken particular pains with the\r\nsix oil paintings of \"Marriage à la Mode,\" which have been placed in the\r\nNational Gallery; and these painted novels reveal in strength and beauty\r\nof execution the high-water mark of his work as a painter. The whole is\r\nquieter, simpler, less overloaded with ingenious accessories. The\r\nimpoverished lord has married his son, who is already worn out with\r\nexcesses, to the strong and healthy daughter of a city alderman. A girl\r\nis born; then they go their separate ways. The husband surprises the\r\nwife with a lover, and is stabbed by him; the unfaithful wife, moved by\r\nthis, begs her dying husband for forgiveness. As a young widow, deprived\r\nof her woman's honour, she goes back to the _bourgeois_, Philistine\r\nennui of her father's house, and when she learns of her lover's\r\ncondemnation she escapes from the burden of her misery by means of\r\npoison. The father is sufficiently provident to take the wedding ring\r\noff her finger before the body is cold, lest it should be stolen from\r\nthe corpse. In the last sequence Hogarth passed over completely to the\r\nmoral sermon and the study of crime. The series \"Industry and Idleness,\"\r\nin 1747, was comprised in twelve sheets, which he produced only in rough\r\nengravings, as he wished exclusively to influence the masses. Two\r\napprentices enter a cloth-weaving business at the same time, of whom one\r\nrises, through his zeal for the interests of the business, to a marriage\r\nwith his master's beautiful daughter, to the rank of alderman, and\r\nfinally to be Lord Mayor of London. The idle apprentice grows, on the\r\ndown grade, from a gambler into a vagabond. He is transported, comes\r\nback again, and ends on the scaffold. The two comrades meet for the last\r\ntime when the honest man announces his death-warrant to the knave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOGARTH.   THE RAKE'S PROGRESS, PLATE VIII.]\r\n\r\nGarrick, as we can see from his epitaph on Hogarth, has not unjustly\r\ncharacterised his art, in these words--\r\n\r\n  \"Farewell, great painter of mankind!\r\n   Who reached the noblest point of art,\r\n   Whose pictured morals charm the mind,\r\n   And through the eye correct the heart.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOGARTH.   MARRIAGE À LA MODE, PLATE V.]\r\n\r\nHogarth painted stirring and humorous scenes, full of effective\r\nmorality, with which he sought to cheer, terrify, and improve humanity.\r\nHis five-act tragedies end always with the triumph of Virtue and the\r\npunishment of Vice. As one of his contemporaries said, he exercised the\r\nart of \"hanging in colours.\" The twelve plates of the parallel\r\nbiographies of \"Industry and Idleness\" he employed as an illustrated\r\nweekly sermon for the benefit of the working classes, and he was able to\r\nobserve with satisfaction that they had an actual influence on the\r\nconduct of the people, as instanced in the diminution of gin shops. Yet\r\nfor all that, in the elevation of public morality, the highest aim of\r\nart is not, as Garrick asserted, fulfilled. Who has ever seen such a\r\npainter? Would he be a painter? It is exactly by this moralising with\r\nthe brush that Hogarth stands in such abrupt opposition to his\r\npredecessors, the Dutch. They were painters, nothing but painters, and\r\nin their painting reckoned on eyes which could appreciate their\r\npictorial subtilty. Man was for them a patch of colour; the real delight\r\nof their eyes was the rich light that came mellowed through the shadows,\r\nand played upon the ruffed garments and the clumsy forms. With Hogarth,\r\nin the place of the idea of colour, the anecdote is brought in. He saw\r\nthe world not so much with the eyes of the painter, as with those of the\r\nphysician, the criminologist, the pastor. The familiar element, that\r\nserene and comfortable observation of an everyday occurrence upon which\r\nDutch art was based, has altogether disappeared in his pictures. He did\r\nnot paint because something pictorial urged him, but saw in men the\r\nactors of the parts which he had in his mind. This departure from the\r\npurely picturesque is in part explained by the predominance of\r\nliterature in England at that time. In a country where the tragedy of\r\nfamiliar life as well as the domestic novel had arisen there was\r\nimminent peril that a young school of painting working without\r\ntraditions should branch off also on to those lines. Hogarth desired to\r\ngive painting a new manner; he seized upon what was epic or dramatic,\r\nand painted the pictorial counter parts to Smollett's and Richardson's\r\nnovels. In the age of enlightenment the painter makes way for the\r\nwriter. With this idea he himself wrote: \"I have endeavoured to treat my\r\nsubjects as a dramatic writer; my picture is my stage, my men and women\r\nmy players, who, by means of certain actions and gestures, are to\r\nexhibit a dumb show.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOGARTH.   THE ENRAGED MUSICIAN.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, to explain the growth of this sort of literary hybrid, one is\r\nforced to consider the changed conditions under which painting was\r\nintroduced into England at large. Art, which hitherto had shone forth\r\nher enchantment upon the few, was conducted from the first in free\r\nEngland along the broad road of popularity, and given over to a public\r\nwhich had to be educated to art by degrees; and this admission of the\r\nmass of the people to the enjoyment of art, in a proportion hitherto\r\nunheard of, must inevitably have a retrogressive effect upon painting\r\nitself. Instead of the earlier amateur of really distinguished culture,\r\nthere stood \"the People.\"\r\n\r\nBut just as in the Middle Ages works of art were seen to be a sort of\r\npicture-writing for the people--_picturis eruditur populus_, said\r\nGregory the Great,--so now the new patrons could hardly require other\r\nthan those works of art in which a story was pictorially told. These\r\ncould be understood even by the man whose understanding was otherwise\r\nwholly closed to matters of art; and hence it came about that almost all\r\nthe _genre_ painters--for very nearly a century--followed with more or\r\nless intelligence in the footsteps of Hogarth. To treat him, as is\r\nfrequently done, because of this popularisation of art, because of this\r\ntransformation of the picture into the picture story, as a pattern\r\ninstance of tastelessness, would lead to very dangerous consequences,\r\nand should be the less employed because Hogarth's pictures are, at\r\nleast, comparatively well painted, whereas many of his successors could\r\nescape the deluge only in the Noah's Ark of their talent for narration.\r\nWhat Hogarth could do when he put off the schoolmaster, he has shown\r\nmoreover in his portraits. There he is an entirely great painter. His\r\npictures have none of that Van Dyck elegance, which had become the mode\r\nin England before him; they are robust, crude, Anglo-Saxon, strongly and\r\nbroadly painted withal, sketches, in the best sense of the word. His\r\n\"Shrimp Girl,\" in the National Gallery, for instance, is a masterpiece\r\nto which the nineteenth century can hardly produce a rival.\r\n\r\nIn the history of painting it is notorious that the latter half of the\r\nlast century belongs especially to portraiture, and here the English\r\noccupy the first rank. Neither Hogarth nor Reynolds nor Gainsborough was\r\na genius like Titian, Velasquez, or even Frans Hals. Their art is not to\r\nbe compared with that of the greatest of all portrait painters, but they\r\nsurpassed all the painters of the eighteenth century; they were not only\r\nthe greatest in England since Van Dyck, but the first portrait painters\r\nin Europe at the time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOGARTH.   GIN LANE.]\r\n\r\nReynolds and Gainsborough lived almost at the same period. The former,\r\nborn in 1723, died in 1792; the latter, born in 1727, died in 1788. They\r\nhad as models men and women of the same society. They went the same\r\nroad, side by side. Many celebrities strayed from one studio to the\r\nother, and were painted by Reynolds as well as by Gainsborough. These\r\nare just the pictures which show us so distinctly how widely the two,\r\nwho were usually mentioned in the same breath, differed from each other\r\nin spite of having grown up on the same soil. Even their outward man\r\ndisplays this dissimilarity.\r\n\r\nReynolds appears in his \"Portrait of Himself\" in the Uffizzi Gallery at\r\nFlorence, in the red mantle of the President of the Academy, the\r\nofficial cap on his head, while the hand resting on the table holds a\r\ncopy of his _Discourses_; close by is a bust of Michael Angelo. The\r\ncomplexion is that of a man who sits much within doors. A pair of\r\nspectacles with large, round glasses leads one to conclude that he\r\ninjured his eyesight early with much reading. Gainsborough, with his\r\nrefined Roman nose, the haughty, curved sensuous lips, and the\r\nexpression of his face which speaks at once of innocence and refinement,\r\ngives an impression far more than Reynolds of the child of nature and\r\nthe gentleman. His cheeks are fresh and rather ruddy; a depth of soul\r\nlies within the large blue eyes, that are somewhat melancholy, yet have\r\nsuch a free outlook upon life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REYNOLDS.   PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF.]\r\n\r\n_Joshua Reynolds'_ father was a clergyman, a most learned man, who kept\r\na Latin school. He gave the boy, it is recorded, that most uncommon\r\nChristian name, for the remarkable reason that he hoped thereby to draw\r\nthe attention of a great personage, who bore the same name, towards his\r\nyoung namesake. His son was to become a physician. But books on other\r\nsubjects which he read at his desk at school made a greater impression\r\non the boy. In the well known _Treatise on Painting_, by Richardson, he\r\ndiscovered his vocation. From the perusal of this book he developed a\r\ntaste for things artistic, studied the works on perspective of Pater\r\nPozzo, read everything he could find on art, and copied as a preliminary\r\nall that fell into his hands in the way of woodcuts and copper\r\nengravings. One of the earliest drawings which remain from his childhood\r\nrepresents the interior of a library. At the age of nineteen he came to\r\nLondon to a well-known master, Hudson, the favourite painter with the\r\ngentry of the day, who required £120 with a pupil. He was already\r\nconvinced that only in London could he find the means to attain fame,\r\nand even as early as 1744 he took a fine establishment and kept open\r\nhouse in order to attract attention. He was soon in a position to\r\ncomplete his artistic education by means of residence in Italy. In 1746\r\nhe had painted the portrait of a Captain Keppel, who shortly afterwards\r\nwas appointed Commodore of the Mediterranean squadron, and invited the\r\nyoung painter to go for a cruise in his ship. They sailed in 1749, and\r\nReynolds was able to spend three years in Italy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  REYNOLDS.   MRS SIDDONS.]\r\n\r\nHis first impression was one of bitter disappointment. Where was that\r\nrich colouring in the Italian classics which he had been led to expect\r\nfrom English mezzotints? Everything struck him as lifeless, pale,\r\ninsipid. Whereupon he affected the opinion that there was no more to\r\nbe seen in Rome. Raphael, in particular, appeared to him to be a\r\nmediocre painter, whom only a remarkable chance had brought to such a\r\npitch of fame. Surrounded by the great masterpieces of the Cinquecento,\r\nhe employed himself in drawing caricatures, and made a sort of travesty\r\nof the _School of Athens_, in which he drew caricatures of the English\r\ncolony in Rome at that time, in the attitudes of figures in the pictures\r\nof Raphael. But he very speedily changed his opinion, and began to\r\nfollow the paths of the great dead. He went indefatigably through the\r\ngalleries of Rome, from Rubens to Titian, from Correggio to Guido and\r\nRaphael. He studied so hard in the Vatican, that he took a chill in the\r\ncold rooms, which left him all his life a little deaf. That sojourn at\r\nRome was to Reynolds what, a hundred years later, his visit to Spain was\r\nto Lenbach.\r\n\r\nHe had already at Hudson's acquired great facility as a copyist, and of\r\nGuercino, in particular, he had made numerous copies. During this\r\nItalian tour, however, he became the greatest connoisseur of old masters\r\nthat the eighteenth century possessed.\r\n\r\nIt is related that the Chevalier Van Loo, when he was in England in\r\n1763, vaunted himself one day, in Reynolds' presence, upon his unfailing\r\ndiscrimination in telling a copy from an original. Whereupon Reynolds\r\nshowed him one of his own studies of a head, after Rembrandt. The\r\nChevalier judged it to be, indisputably, a masterpiece by the great\r\nDutchman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REYNOLDS.   DR. JOHNSON]\r\n\r\nHe left Rome in April 1752, and made a further visit to Naples, to the\r\ncities of Tuscany, and to Venice. The careless notes of travel that he\r\nmade on this journey show the clear insight which he had attained into\r\nthe Italian schools. They all deal with questions of technique, on\r\neffects of light and shadow, on the mystery of _chiaroscuro_. For\r\nTitian, in particular, he had an extravagant devotion,--he would ruin\r\nhimself, he said, if he might only possess one of the great works of\r\nTitian.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to England in 1752, at the age of thirty, his talent\r\nwas fully developed, and the connoisseurs were unanimous in hailing him\r\nas a new Van Dyck. With the portrait of Miss Gunning, afterwards the\r\nDuchess of Hamilton, he appeared in 1753 as a power in English art. As\r\nearly as 1755, when Hogarth was compelled to give up portrait painting\r\nfor lack of patrons, one hundred and twenty-five persons sat for\r\nReynolds, and after that about one hundred and fifty people were painted\r\nby him annually; and this brought him in a yearly income of about\r\n£16,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REYNOLDS.   GARRICK AS ABEL DRUGGER.]\r\n\r\nAt first he took up his quarters in St. Martin's Lane, which was then\r\nthe most fashionable place of residence for artists; but in 1760 he\r\nbought a house, No. 47 Leicester Square, the most select quarter of\r\nLondon, and furnished it with the most palatial splendour. The studio,\r\nwhich he built for himself, was as large as a ballroom, and furnished\r\nwith a quite modern luxury. The large corridor that led to it had a\r\ngallery of pictures by old masters. It was the age of the great literary\r\nand dramatic revival in England. Garrick stood at the zenith of his\r\npopularity, Burke had already made himself a name, Johnson had produced\r\nhis _Dictionary_, Richardson had reached the summit of his fame,\r\nSmollett had written _Peregrine Pickle_, Gray had attracted notice by\r\nhis verse. All these and others who set the vogue in literature and the\r\ndrama, the principal figures in politics, the leaders of fashion,\r\nlounged in that luxurious studio and gossiped with Reynolds of the\r\ntheatre, both before and behind the scenes, of the doings in Parliament\r\nand the scandal of the Court, of literature and of art. At the time when\r\nGoldsmith was putting the finishing touches to his _Travels_ he was a\r\nguest of the house. Gibbon, the historian, and Sterne, whose\r\n_Sentimental Journey_ was just then the talk of the town, spent their\r\nvacant hours with him; and Burke as well, while he discussed with him\r\nhis treatise on the _Sublime and the Beautiful_. All these claimed a\r\nniche in Reynolds' portrait gallery, where all the talents were met\r\ntogether. The whole English nobility also flocked to him. For forty\r\nyears onwards from 1752 it was considered the proper thing to be painted\r\nby him. His pictures were multiplied immediately at the hands of the\r\nengravers. In the complete catalogue of Reynolds' works, Hamilton\r\ncounts, so far back as 1820, no fewer than 675 plates, engraved after\r\nReynolds by more than a hundred artists, and amongst these the\r\nmezzotints of Samuel Cousins are by far the finest. Only an incredible\r\nindustry, enabling him for a long succession of years to paint almost\r\nwithout intermission with a facility and regularity like that of Rubens,\r\nrendered it possible for Reynolds to complete, exclusive of portraits,\r\nquite a number of religious and mythological pictures, of which he\r\nhimself was especially proud. He painted with great speed and dexterity,\r\nrose very early, breakfasted at nine o'clock, was in his studio\r\npunctually at ten; and there till eleven he worked on pictures which had\r\nbeen commenced. On the stroke of eleven the first sitter arrived, who\r\nwas succeeded by another an hour later. Thus he painted till four\r\no'clock, when he made his toilette, and thenceforward belonged to\r\nsociety, for in spite of his scholarly temperament one can by no means\r\nconsider Reynolds as a solitary eccentric. Although he remained a\r\nbachelor after Angelica Kauffmann had declined his hand, his house was a\r\ncentral gathering-point for noble London. He gave balls to which the\r\nwhole of \"Society\" was invited, and drove in a magnificent carriage,\r\nwith coachmen in blue and silver liveries. The Literary Club was founded\r\nat his instigation, where with Johnson, Burke, Goldsmith, Gibbon, and\r\nGarrick he shared in conversation both profound and brilliant. He was\r\nmade a baronet, and when the Royal Academy was founded in 1768, became\r\nits first president. The dinners of the Academy, which he organised at\r\nthe distribution of prizes, play a part in the history of English\r\ncookery. Reynolds had promised that on each of these reunions he would\r\nspeak on some question of art. In this manner originated, during his\r\ntwenty-three years of office, those fifteen discourses upon painting\r\nwhich show the highest result of his literary energy. They were not his\r\nmaiden essays. As far back as 1758 Johnson had invited him to publish an\r\narticle upon Art in a journal which he had founded, _The Idler_. In 1781\r\nhe made a journey through Holland and Flanders, upon which, anticipating\r\nFromentin, he wrote an exceedingly fine book. In his _Discourses_ so\r\nhigh a degree of literary talent was displayed that they were at one\r\ntime said to be the work of Johnson or Burke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REYNOLDS.   HEADS OF ANGELS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REYNOLDS.   SAMUEL RICHARDSON.]\r\n\r\nThey are æsthetic treatises and essays in the history of art, of an\r\nenduring value. Originating from a vast insight, and expressed in a\r\nprecise style, they treat of the laws of classic art, the variation in\r\nstyles, the causes of the finest bloom in art. Certainly eclecticism is\r\npreached too. The modern artist, it is declared, can only stand on the\r\nshoulders of his forebears. The great Italians must be his models, and\r\nof these the greatest is Michael Angelo. His last essay closes with\r\nthese words: \"I reflect, not without vanity, that these discourses bear\r\ntestimony of my admiration of that truly divine man, and I should desire\r\nthat the last words which I should pronounce in this Academy, and from\r\nthis place, might be the name of Michael Angelo.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he died, his friend Edmund Burke wrote in the funeral oration which\r\nhe dedicated to him: \"Sir Joshua Reynolds was, on many accounts, one of\r\nthe most memorable men of his time. He was the first Englishman who\r\nadded the praise of the elegant arts to the other glories of his\r\ncountry. In taste, in grace, in facility, in happy invention, and in the\r\nrichness and harmony of colouring, he was equal to the greatest masters\r\nof the renowned ages.... In full affluence of foreign and domestic fame,\r\nadmired by the expert in art and by the learned in science, courted by\r\nthe great, caressed by sovereign powers and celebrated by distinguished\r\npoets, ... the loss of no man of his time can be felt with more sincere,\r\ngeneral, and unmixed sorrow.\" He was buried with great pomp in St.\r\nPaul's Cathedral. The pictures left unfinished at his death fetched at\r\nauction £37,000; the whole fortune which he left is estimated at\r\n£80,000.\r\n\r\nThe biography of _Thomas Gainsborough_ reads quite differently.\r\n\r\nThe traveller who rides from London to Birmingham passes through some of\r\nthe fairest scenery in the island. He finds himself in the heart of\r\nfresh and tender English nature. Small rivulets flow through the gently\r\nundulating country. Wide meadows clothe the soft hollows in the valleys\r\nwith abundant green. In grassy enclosures deer and roes are feeding;\r\nthey push forwards inquisitively as the train passes. Fragrant linden\r\ntrees rise dreamily in the suave, park-like landscape, through which the\r\nStour winds along like a riband of silver. On the bank of this\r\nenchanting stream Thomas Gainsborough, the son of a simple clothier, was\r\nborn. Reynolds' vocation had been brought about through the perusal of a\r\nbook. In the scenery and the woods that were in the neighbourhood of his\r\nhome, Gainsborough, who was so alive to all the beauty of nature,\r\nreceived the decisive impression of his life. Here he roamed as a boy,\r\nwhile he neglected his school lessons. \"Tom will be hung some day,\"\r\nreflected his schoolmaster; \"Tom will be a genius,\" thought his parents.\r\nHe sketched the parks and castles of the neighbourhood. In his later\r\nlife he used to say that there was no picturesque old tree trunk, no\r\nmeadow or woodland glade or stream within a four-mile radius of Sudbury,\r\nthat he did not retain a recollection of from his childish years. Like\r\nConstable, when he was an old man, he still thought with gratitude of\r\nhis home, of all that beauty upon which he had looked, and which had\r\nmade him a painter. Here, in the green woods and fresh pastures of his\r\nbirthplace, he trained himself. At the age of ten he was a painter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REYNOLDS.   MISS REYNOLDS.]\r\n\r\nA sojourn of four years in London seems to have added little to his\r\nability. Elegant in his manners, lively in his conversation, a born\r\ngentleman, he might have become completely the man of fashion. But he\r\nwas far too diffident, with his naïve simplicity, to force himself\r\namongst the stars of the world of art in London, far too distinguished\r\nand retiring to join in the race after the favour of the public, and so\r\nat the age of eighteen he returned to his native place with the\r\nunencouraging prospect of playing the part of a simple painter in the\r\nprovinces. First and last, the woods remained his chief delight. One\r\nmorning, as he was painting there, he looked up from his easel and saw a\r\nyoung and beautiful girl in a light summer dress, peeping coquettishly\r\nfrom behind the trunk of a tree. She blushed, he spoke to her shyly.\r\nSoon afterwards Margaret Burr became his wife, and the whole history of\r\nhis life with her remains a charming idyll, like the spring morning on\r\nwhich he made her acquaintance. Married at the age of nineteen, he\r\ninstalled himself at Ipswich, his wife's native place, and there he\r\nspent fifteen years in great happiness, firm in the conviction that he\r\nwould end his days there. There he painted his first portraits, which,\r\nfrom 1761, were forwarded by a carrier's cart to London for exhibition\r\nin the Royal Academy. From Ipswich he went to Bath, the fashionable\r\nwatering-place, where he painted the visitors who came in the summer for\r\nthe cure. Finally, in the end his portraits met with approval in London.\r\nThat gave him courage in 1764 to proceed thither himself; and there he\r\ntook very modest rooms. On his arrival he was as yet very little known;\r\nhe came from the provinces, which he had till then never left, at a time\r\nwhen Reynolds stood at the pinnacle of his fame, and had visited Italy\r\nand Spain. Yet he gradually won a reputation. Franklin was one of the\r\nfirst to sit to him. Soon he became the favourite painter of the king\r\nand the royal family. George III was painted eight times by him, Pitt\r\nseven times, Garrick five. Lord Chancellor Camden, Sir William\r\nBlackstone, Johnson, Laurence Sterne, Richardson, Burke, Sheridan, Mrs.\r\nGraham, Lady Montagu, Mrs. Siddons, Lady Vernon, Lady Maynard, and the\r\nnames of many other celebrities and beauties are bound up with his. His\r\nlife-work, excluding sketches, consists of no more than three hundred\r\npictures, of which two hundred and twenty are portraits--a very small\r\nnumber in comparison with the four thousand paintings of Joshua\r\nReynolds. Thomas Gainsborough painted irregularly. Even when he was in\r\nhis studio he might be seen standing for hours gazing out of his window\r\ndreamily at the grass. In other features of his life too he was equally\r\ndifferent from Reynolds: unaccountably, he was one moment a brilliant,\r\nanimated companion, the next plunged in melancholy. He dreamed much,\r\nwhile Reynolds painted and wrote. In the evenings he usually sat at home\r\nwith his dear little wife, completed no treatises or discourses on his\r\nart, but made sketches or sometimes music. Reynolds was a\r\nscholar-painter, Gainsborough a painter-musician. It was said of him\r\nthat he painted portraits for money and landscapes for amusement, but\r\nthat he made music because he needs must. He collected musical\r\ninstruments as Reynolds did a library. Even in his pictures he gives his\r\npeople, for preference, violins in their hands. To the Musical Club\r\nwhich he had founded in Ipswich he remained faithful all his life, and\r\nin that neighbourhood, or in Richmond or Hampstead, he spent the summer\r\nevery year. Here amidst that green nature it was also his wish to be\r\nburied. His funeral was a very quiet one. In the peaceful graveyard at\r\nKew, Thomas Gainsborough sleeps tranquilly under the shady willows, far\r\nfrom the noise and tumult of the great city. Sir Joshua said at his\r\ngrave: \"Should England ever become so fruitful in talent that we can\r\nventure to speak of an English school, then will Gainsborough's name be\r\nhanded down to posterity as one of the first.\" Yes, one might say\r\nto-day, as the first of all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REYNOLDS.   EDMUND BURKE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REYNOLDS.   MRS. ABINGTON.]\r\n\r\nJoshua Reynolds is certainly a great painter, and deserves the high\r\nveneration in which his compatriots hold him. It is not without a\r\ncertain awe that, in the Diploma Gallery of the Royal Academy, one can\r\nlook upon the armchair that he used during his sittings, upon which all\r\nwho were famous in eighteenth-century England have sat. Reynolds is one\r\nof the greatest English portrait painters, and, resembling most the\r\nclassical masters, showed in the highest degree the qualities we admire\r\nin them. His colouring is of an amazing softness, depth, and strength;\r\nhis _chiaroscuro_ is warm and vaporous. There are portraits by him\r\nwhich, in the subtlety of their tone, resemble the best of Rembrandt's;\r\nothers, whose noble colouring approaches the _chef-d'oeuvres_ of Van\r\nDyck. Master of the whole mechanism of the human body, he possessed in\r\nthe highest degree the rare art of setting persons surely and\r\nunconstrainedly on their feet. His portraits are pictures; one needs no\r\nwhit to be acquainted with the persons they represent; they satisfy as\r\nworks of art in themselves, and as psychological studies by a man who\r\nhad the capacity of sounding the depths of the human heart. The complete\r\ncatalogue of all those who sat for Sir Joshua during the space of half a\r\ncentury forms an uninterrupted commentary on the contemporary history of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REYNOLDS.   EDMUND MALONE.]\r\n\r\nThere we see the skilful portrait of Sterne, with his look of witty\r\nmockery; the marvellous Bohemian, Oliver Goldsmith, who even then had\r\nthe manuscript of his _Vicar of Wakefield_ in his pocket; Johnson, who,\r\nin one, sits at his writing-table, on which stands an ink-pot and a\r\nvolume of his _English Dictionary_, and in another is peering into a\r\nbook with his short-sighted eyes screwed up tightly, and his whole\r\nposture awkward and unwieldy. Garrick, who went from one studio to the\r\nother, appears also more than once in Reynolds' portrait gallery.\r\nAmongst his portraits of military dignitaries, that of General Lord\r\nHeathfield, the famous defender of Gibraltar, whom he painted in full\r\nuniform, is one of the most noticeable. Strong as a rock he stands\r\nthere, with the key of the fortress in his hand. What a contrast between\r\nthese figures and those of the contemporary French portraits! There,\r\nthose friendly and smiling ministers, those gallant and dainty\r\necclesiastics, those scented, graceful marquises, who move with such\r\nelegant ease about the parquet floor, and from whose faces a uniform\r\nrefinement has erased all the roughness of individuality; here,\r\nexpressive, thoughtful heads, characters hardened in the school of life,\r\nmany of the faces coarse and bloated, the glance telling of cold\r\nresolution, the attitude full of self-reliant dignity and gnarled,\r\nplebeian pride. The same _bourgeois_ element predominates in the\r\npictures of the ladies. Van Dyck's noble, eminently intellectual figures\r\nalways wore the glamour of the Renaissance. In the background an\r\nartistically arranged curtain, a column, or the view of the quiet\r\navenues of some broad park. From Reynolds we get strong active women in\r\ntheir everyday clothes, and with thoughtful countenances: good mothers,\r\nsurrounded by their children, whom they kiss and enfold in a tender\r\nembrace. The idea of half-symbolical representation has vanished, and in\r\nits place is introduced the idea of home and the family. The pictures of\r\nchildren by this childless old bachelor were an artistic revelation to\r\nthe existing generation, and are the delight of the world of to-day. In\r\nother portraits of ladies, that noticeable characteristic of the English\r\nnation, their predilection for domestic animals and for sport, finds an\r\nexpression. The beautiful Duchess of Devonshire he painted as she gently\r\nrestrained with her finger her little daughter's caresses, which would\r\nfain have disordered her _coiffure_; a whole gallery of noble ladies he\r\nrepresented feeding their poultry or petting their lap-dogs; Lady\r\nSpencer in her riding-habit, her whip in her hand, her horse reined in,\r\nher cheeks flushed from her gallop. Nelly O'Brien looks an actress, a\r\nwoman who turned men's heads, and she does it still to-day in Reynolds'\r\npicture. There lurks something enigmatic, perplexing in the smile of\r\nthis sphinx--only Monna Lisa had such a smile, but Nelly's eyes are\r\ndeeper, more desirous. One feels that in the three centuries since Monna\r\nLisa love has taken on a new and subtler _nuance_. The portrait of Mrs.\r\nSiddons is the most famous of the pictures of actresses which Reynolds\r\npainted, and Mrs. Siddons, of all the women of that time, is the one\r\nwhose portrait occupied the painters most. She was the daughter of Roger\r\nKemble, the actor, and sister of that pretty actress, Mrs. Twiss, whose\r\nportrait by Reynolds (in 1784) we also have, and of the famous John\r\nPhilip Kemble, who figures so often in the portrait gallery of Lawrence,\r\nas Hamlet, Cato, Coriolanus, Richard III, etc. Born to the boards, as it\r\nwere, she had, when still a child, joined her parents on their Thespian\r\npilgrimages, and had had many engagements in the provinces, at\r\nBirmingham, Manchester, and Bath, before she was recruited by the\r\nplaywright Sheridan for the Drury Lane company in London. She made her\r\n_début_ there on 10th October 1782, and was hailed forthwith as the\r\ngreatest actress of her time. Lady Macbeth was her great part; in that\r\nshe was painted both by Romney and Lawrence. Reynolds painted her as the\r\nTragic Muse. A diadem encircles her hair, she sits upon a throne, the\r\nthrone rests upon clouds. Behind her stand two allegorical beings, Crime\r\nand Remorse, two quite unfortunate figures. But the principal figure is\r\ntruly great, in its noble, regal attitude, and quite unconstrained in\r\nits dramatic pose. Reynolds had the composition in his mind many weeks\r\nbefore Mrs. Siddons sat for him in the autumn of 1783. \"Take your seat\r\nupon the throne for which you were born, and suggest to me the idea of\r\nthe Tragic Muse.\" With these words he conducted her to the pedestal. \"I\r\nmade a few steps,\" the actress relates, \"and then took at once the\r\nattitude in which the Tragic Muse has remained.\" When the picture was\r\nfinished, says Sir Joshua, gallant as ever: \"I cannot lose this\r\nopportunity of sending my name to posterity on the hem of your garment.\"\r\nAnd he, who hardly ever signed his pictures, wrote in large characters\r\nhis name and the date on the gold-embroidered border of the dress. The\r\noriginal picture has been in the possession of the Grosvenor family\r\nsince 1822; a second copy is in the gallery at Dulwich.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REYNOLDS.   OLIVER GOLDSMITH.]\r\n\r\nReynolds loved to depict his sitters in mythological or historical\r\nsettings. Thus he painted Mrs. Hartley, her son as a nymph and the\r\nyouthful Bacchus, the three Misses Montgomery as the Three Graces\r\ncrowning a term of Hymen, a little girl sitting on the grass as the \"Age\r\nof Innocence,\" Lady Spencer as a gipsy telling her brother's fortune,\r\nMrs. Sheridan as St. Cecilia. The five \"Heads of Angels,\" as they are\r\ncalled, in the National Gallery, are five different studies of the\r\nlovely child-head of little Isabella Gordon. Garrick, in one of his\r\npictures, is set between the allegorical figures of Tragedy and Comedy.\r\nReynolds himself was frankly proud of these portraits in the mood of\r\nhistory. He was, as he said, in general only a portrait painter because\r\nthe world required it; that which he aspired after was the great manner\r\nof historical painting. Nevertheless, pictures, such as the \"Little\r\nHercules with the Serpent,\" \"Cupid unfastening the Girdle of Venus,\"\r\n\"The Death of Dido,\" \"The Forbearance of Scipio,\" \"The Childhood of the\r\nProphet Samuel,\" or \"The Adoration of the Shepherds,\" do not cause us to\r\ndeplore too bitterly that he rarely found time for such mythological and\r\nhistorical pictures. His _putti_ are derived from Correggio; in the\r\narrangement of drapery he resembles Guido; in his \"Venus\" he is a\r\ncoarser Titian. Reynolds' own manner in these pictures is merely the\r\neclectic accumulation of the peculiarities of the old masters--he\r\nbrought no new element into historical painting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REYNOLDS.   LADY COCKBURN AND HER DAUGHTERS.]\r\n\r\nAnd herein lies his principal weakness. Hogarth declared: \"There is only\r\none school, that of nature.\" Reynolds: \"There is only one doorway to the\r\nschool of nature, and of that the old masters hold the key.\" The great\r\nmen of old were for him the object of constant and conscious thought. He\r\nhas endeavoured in his writings to propound a sort of general foundation\r\nof painting, has adopted the principles of the best painters in every\r\nland, was indefatigable in exploring the secrets of the old\r\nmasterpieces, and has therefore won the praise of having set the English\r\nschool, which had hitherto possessed no perfected tradition of painting,\r\ntechnically on firm feet. He was the founder of a scientific technique\r\nof painting derived from the ancients,--the Lenbach of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Upon the mixture of colours, the gradations of light and shade,\r\ntechnically and æsthetically, no artist has pondered more than he, who\r\nknew the great Netherlanders, Rubens, Van Dyck, and Rembrandt, as well\r\nas, or better than, his particular favourites, the Italians. He made\r\nexperiments all his life long to discover the stone of the wise\r\nVenetians; but he met with the same experience as Lenbach. And these\r\nexperiments in the direction of the colour effects of the old masters\r\nwere the bane of his pictures' durability. It was well said by Walpole:\r\n\"If Sir Joshua is content with his own blemished pictures, then he is\r\nhappier than their possessors, or posterity. According to my view, he\r\nought to be paid in annual instalments, and only so long as his works\r\nlast.\" And Haydon opined that \"Reynolds sought by tricks to obtain\r\nresults which the old masters attained by the simplest means.\" He\r\nendeavoured by means of asphaltum to give his pictures the artistic\r\ntones of the galleries, with the result that, to-day, the majority have\r\nlost every sign of freshness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REYNOLDS.   BISHOP PERCY]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the pose also, and similar conceptions, one can never\r\nquite get away from the thought of Van Dyck and other old masters.\r\nReynolds' chief endeavour, not only as regards colouring, but also in\r\nother respects, was to resemble the ancients, and this has brought into\r\nhis pictures something imitative and laboured. He dearly loved the\r\nRomans and Venetians; we believe to-day that he loved almost too dearly\r\nthe Bolognese. And just that fine, artistic education which he received\r\nin Italy and Holland, and the scientific method in which he practised\r\nhis art, did harm to Reynolds, and brought into his pictures too much\r\nreminiscence, too many alien touches. He has in most cases understood\r\nit--how to bring into uniformity the numerous borrowings of his palette,\r\nall that he had taken from Leonardo, Correggio, Velasquez, and\r\nRembrandt. Yet he has never quite forgotten the old masters and looked\r\nonly at his model, for the sake of the very daintiest lady or the\r\nfreshest English boy. For his children he thought of Correggio's\r\n\"Cherubim,\" for his schoolboys of Murillo, for the portrait of Mrs.\r\nHartley of Leonardo da Vinci, for that of Mrs. Sheridan of Raphael.\r\nThere lacked in him that spontaneity which denotes the great master. By\r\nhis erudition in art, Sir Joshua elevated himself on the shoulders of\r\nall who had preceded him. He obtained thereby the piquant effects in his\r\nportraits, but it was at the price of the penalty that from many of his\r\nworks it is rather a rancid odour of oil and varnish which exhales than\r\nthe breath of life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REYNOLDS.   THE GIRL WITH THE MOUSETRAP.]\r\n\r\nGainsborough can certainly not be compared with Reynolds in the mass of\r\nhis work. He was master neither of his powers of industry nor of his\r\nsmooth and brilliant methods of painting that were always sure of their\r\neffect. In many of his pictures he gives the impression of a self-taught\r\nman, who sought to help himself to the best of his power. Just as little\r\nhas he the psychological acuteness of Reynolds. A portrait painter puts\r\nno more into a head than he has in his own; thus the acute thinker,\r\nReynolds, was able to put a great deal into his heads, whilst\r\nGainsborough, the dreamer, was often enough quite helpless when he\r\nconfronted a conspicuously manly character. In his whole temperament a\r\npainter of landscape, before his model too he sat as before a landscape,\r\nwith eyes that perceived but did not analyse. What, with Reynolds, was\r\nsought out and understood, was felt by Gainsborough; and therefore the\r\nformer is always good and correct, while Gainsborough is unequal and\r\noften faulty, but in his best pictures has a charm to which those of the\r\nPresident of the Academy never attained. Gainsborough, too, at his death\r\nmurmured the name of an old master. \"We are all going to Heaven, and Van\r\nDyck is of the company.\" But what distinguishes him from Reynolds, and\r\ngives him a character of greater originality, is just his naïve\r\nindependence of the ancients, which resulted partly from the different\r\nnature of his education in art. Reynolds had lived for two years in Rome\r\nand explored all the principal cities of Italy, had visited Flanders and\r\nHolland, learnt to wonder at Rembrandt, and developed an enthusiasm for\r\n_chiaroscuro_. Gainsborough in his rural seclusion had been able neither\r\nby travel on the Continent to study the great masters of the past, nor\r\nto assimilate the traditions of the studio. He contented himself with\r\nthe beauties which he saw in his native country, studied them in their\r\ntouching simplicity, without troubling himself about academic rules. He\r\nlived in London until his death, without once leaving England; and that\r\ngives to his pictures a distinct _nuance_. The one studied pictures and\r\nbooks, the other only the \"book of nature.\" His portraits never aim at\r\nany external effect, nor are they raised into the historical; they seek\r\nto give no other impression than that of a quite subjective truth to\r\nnature, both in arrangement and in colouring. Nothing intruded between\r\nhis model and himself, no \"sombre old master\" obscured his canvas. His\r\nexecution is more personal, his colour fresher and more transparent. The\r\nvery personages seem with him to be more elegant, more gracious, more\r\nmodern than with Reynolds, in whose work, through their kinship to the\r\nRenaissance, they received a suggestion of style, classical and ancient.\r\n\r\nIn his pictures the Englishman is clearly revealed, an Englishman of\r\nthat delicacy and noble refinement which is present to a unique degree\r\nin the works of English painters of the present day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REYNOLDS.   DR. BURNEY.]\r\n\r\nThe passage from Hogarth to Gainsborough marks a chapter in the history\r\nof English culture. Hogarth is the embodiment of John Bull; you can hear\r\nhim growl, like some savage bull-dog. That brutal, indecorous robustness\r\nof England's aggressive youth becomes, in Gainsborough's hands,\r\nagreeable, refined, gentle, and seductive. Reynolds, with his robustness\r\nas of the old masters, might be best compared with Tintoretto;\r\nGainsborough, in his quite modern and fantastic elegance, is a more\r\ntender, subtle, and mysterious spirit, poet and magician at once, like\r\nWatteau. There one listened to the full, swelling chords of the organ;\r\nhere to the soft, dulcet, silvery notes of the violin. Reynolds loved\r\nwarm, brown and red tones; Gainsborough essayed for the first time, in a\r\nseries of his happiest creations, that scale of colour, coldly green and\r\nblue, in which to-day the majority of English pictures are still\r\npainted. Everything with him is soft and clear; the tone of those blue\r\nor light yellow silks, which he loved especially, is that of the most\r\ntransparent enamel; the background fades away into dreamy vapour, the\r\nfigures are surrounded with an atmosphere of seduction. What a\r\nmasterpiece he has created in the \"Blue Boy,\" his most popular and most\r\nindividual picture. One can describe every piece of the clothing, but\r\nit is impossible to reproduce the harmony of the painting, the rich,\r\npure blue of the costume, which stands out against a lustrous, brown\r\nbackground of landscape. How the stately youth stands, noble from head\r\nto foot, in the brown and green autumn landscape, with its canopy of\r\nsky! Master Bootall was by far the most elegant portrait painted in\r\nEngland since Van Dyck, and withal of a nervosity quite new. See that\r\nyouthful pride in the gaze, that mobile sensibility in the pose!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS GAINSBOROUGH.]\r\n\r\nHave men grown different, then, or does the painter see further? One\r\nfinds in Van Dyck no such expressively _nervous_ physiognomy. The\r\nsuggestion of melancholy, the deep reverie, the noble, aristocratic\r\nhaughtiness,--Gainsborough was the first to discover that, and give it\r\nits full expression. And the same man who painted the noble elegance of\r\nthis youthful _grand seigneur_ depicted also peasant children coming\r\nfresh from the green fields and woodlands of their village homes. In Sir\r\nJoshua's children there was often something borrowed from Correggio; the\r\nchildren of Gainsborough breathe a rustic charm, an untamed savagery;\r\nthey are the very offshoots of nature, who disport themselves as freely\r\nas the wild things in the woods. But his women in particular are\r\ncreatures altogether adorable. While Reynolds, the historical painter,\r\nliked to promote his into heroines, those of Gainsborough, with their\r\npure, transparent skins, their sweet glances (in which there lies so\r\nadmirable a mixture of languishing fragility, innocence, and coquetry),\r\nare the true Englishwomen of the eighteenth century. His \"Mrs. Siddons\"\r\nis not in theatrical costume, but in a simple walking-dress; no Tragic\r\nMuse, but the passionate, loving woman who once, a romantic, impulsive\r\nmiss, escaped from a convent at the risk of her life, to join a handsome\r\nyoung actor of her father's troupe who had entirely fascinated her. What\r\na charming grace in the pose, what fine taste in the arrangement, what\r\nwonderful purity of colouring! With the exception of Watteau, I know of\r\nno older master who could have painted such moist, dreamy, sensuous,\r\ntender eyes. The marvellous \"Mrs. Graham,\" in the National Gallery of\r\nScotland, is, from the purely pictorial standpoint, perhaps the greatest\r\nof all his works. Yet how beautiful is the double portrait of that young\r\nmarried couple, the Halletts, who, tenderly holding hands, pass along a\r\ndeserted path in some secluded garden; or that pale, languishing \"Mrs.\r\nParsons,\" with her enchanting smile, and that mysterious language of the\r\neyes. Gainsborough was no keen observer, but he was a susceptible,\r\nsensitive spirit who intercepted the soul itself, the play of the\r\nnerves, the slightest suggestion of spiritual commotion. There moves\r\nthrough the majority of his portraits a pathetic tenderness, a breath of\r\ndreamy melancholy, that the persons themselves hardly possessed, but\r\nwhich he transfused into them out of himself. Melancholy is the veil\r\nthrough which he saw things, as Reynolds saw them through the medium of\r\nerudition. Reynolds was all will and intelligence, Gainsborough all soul\r\nand temperament; and nothing can show the difference between them better\r\nthan the fact that Reynolds, who had formed his style on early models,\r\nwhen he had no sitters painted historical pictures; whilst Gainsborough\r\nin like circumstances painted landscapes. Herein he was a pioneer,\r\nwhilst Reynolds was an issue of the past.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  GAINSBOROUGH.   MRS. SIDDONS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  GAINSBOROUGH.   WOOD SCENE, VILLAGE OF CORNARD, SUFFOLK.]\r\n\r\nIn the domain of landscape painting, too, the new germs of naturalism,\r\nwhich had ventured above ground on all sides in the fifteenth century,\r\nhad been again stunted in the Great Renaissance. The theory had been\r\npromulgated in the sixteenth century--in accordance with the idealistic\r\nmethods of the age--that it behoved the painter to improve upon nature\r\njust as much as upon the human body. With the lofty style of the great\r\nfigure painters, and their artfully pondered composition, there\r\ncorresponded a school of landscape which was likewise conceived of, in\r\nthe first degree, as an honourable, architectural framing for a\r\nmythological episode. England too possessed, in _Richard Wilson_, a\r\nbeliever in this doctrine, which became so widely promulgated in the\r\nseventeenth century through the influence of Claude Lorraine. The home\r\nof his soul was Italy. He scraped together a small sum of money by\r\nportrait painting, borrowed the rest, and felt himself in his element\r\nfor the first time when he had reached Venice. Here, at the instance of\r\nZucarrelli, he became a painter of landscapes, and was aided in his\r\nendeavours by Joseph Vernet in Rome. He was on the way to become a\r\npainter in great request, and in many of his pictures he shows a most\r\ndelicate notion of well-balanced and gracious composition in the manner\r\nof Claude. But his success was of no long duration. Wilson, like so many\r\nother of his contemporaries, had the fixed idea that the Creator had\r\nonly made nature to serve as a framework for the \"Grief of Niobe\" and as\r\na vehicle for classical architecture. The interpolated stage scenery of\r\ntrees and the classic temples of this English Claude, contain nothing\r\nwhich had not been already painted better by the Frenchman. When the\r\nking, in order to assist him, asked him on one occasion to represent Kew\r\nGardens in a picture, he composed an entirely imaginary landscape and\r\nilluminated it with the sun of Tivoli. The king sent him back the\r\npicture, mordant epigrams appeared in the journals, and Reynolds scoffed\r\nat him in his Discourses. After that Wilson spent his days in the\r\nalehouse, until he got delirium, and died half starved at the age of\r\nseventy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  GAINSBOROUGH.   THE MARKET CART.]\r\n\r\nThe patriotic English were too much bound up with their own soil to\r\nacquire a taste for the exotic, ideal scenery of Wilson. There existed\r\nin them that patriotism, that feeling for home, which had turned the\r\nDutch of the seventeenth century into landscape painters. In this\r\nprovince also they were destined to step in, as the inheritors of the\r\nDutch, to bring the germ of intimate landscape to its full fruition.\r\nLovely and luxuriant valleys with their soft grass, sweet woodlands with\r\ntheir vari-coloured foliage, golden, swaying cornfields and picturesque\r\nlittle cottages, with that indescribable softness of atmosphere, must of\r\nthemselves direct the eye of the writer and the painter to all these\r\nbeauties. It was an Englishman who in the eighteenth century wrote the\r\nmost memorable book upon the charms of nature. James Thomson, in his\r\n_Seasons_, is the first great nature painter amongst the poets. Taine\r\nfinds the whole of Rousseau anticipated in him. \"Thirty years before\r\nRousseau, Thomson had forestalled all the sentiments of Rousseau, almost\r\nin the same style.\" He has not only, like Rousseau, a profound feeling\r\nfor the great wild aspects of nature, for the forms of clouds, effects\r\nof light and contrasts of colour, but he delights also in the smell of\r\nthe dairy, in small birds, in the woodland shadows, and the light on the\r\nmeadows,--in all things sequestered and idyllic.\r\n\r\n  \"Nature! great parent! whose unceasing hand\r\n   Rolls round the Seasons of the changeful year,\r\n   How mighty, how majestic are thy works!\r\n   With what a pleasing dread they swell the soul\r\n   That sees astonished and astonished sings.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  GAINSBOROUGH.   THE DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  GAINSBOROUGH.   THE SISTERS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  GAINSBOROUGH.   THE WATERING PLACE.]\r\n\r\nIt was a remarkable chance which ordained that Thomas Gainsborough, the\r\nfirst man who as a painter depicted the gracious charms of the country\r\nof his birth, the comeliness of its expanses of deep green lush meadows,\r\nthe strength of the lofty, wide-spreading trees, as seen with the eyes\r\nof a lover, should be born in the spring of the same year in which\r\nThomson's _Spring_ appeared. That he knew and admired Thomson is proved\r\nby his dedication to him of that delightful \"Musidora\" in the National\r\nGallery, a lovely woman bathing her feet in some shady forest pool. It\r\nis said that he only sent half a dozen landscapes to the Academy during\r\nthe eighteen years that he exhibited there. On the other hand, they hung\r\nin his house in Pall Mall in long rows on the walls of his studio. After\r\nhis death his widow held a sale, at which fifty-six landscapes were\r\nsold. Gainsborough must be accounted one of the moderns, so naïve and\r\nintimate is the impression which his pictures produce. He, who passed\r\nhis whole youth in the idyllic loveliness of the woods, was fitted to be\r\nthe delineator of that mellow English nature. He understood the murmur\r\nof the brooks and the sighing of the winds. Like his own life, so\r\nregular and peaceful, gently swaying as though to the friendly\r\nelements, are the trees in his pictures, with their peaceful\r\ntranquillity; no storm disturbs the calm of a Gainsborough picture. His\r\nwas a contented, harmonious spirit, like Corot's. His landscapes know no\r\ntempestuous grandeur; they are a playground for children, a place for\r\nshepherds to rest. \"The calm of mid day, the haze of twilight, the dew\r\nand the pearls of morning,\" said Constable, \"are what we find in the\r\npictures of this good, kindly, happy man.... As we look at them the\r\ntears spring to our eyes, and we know not whence they come. The solitary\r\nshepherd with his flock, the peasant returning from the wood with his\r\nbundle of faggots, whispering woods and open dales, sweet little peasant\r\nchildren with their pitchers in springtime,--that is what he loved to\r\npaint and what he painted, with as much sought-out refinement as with\r\ntender truth to nature.\" His landscapes are like windows opening on the\r\ncountry, not compositions, but pieces taken straight out of that\r\nfruitful English nature. Every year he used to return to his green\r\npastures, and paint very early, when the sun rose. Before him rose a\r\ncluster of trees, all round the farm the flocks were grazing, thousands\r\nof busy bees flew buzzing from flower to flower; goats, with their kids,\r\nwere feeding in the meadows, wild doves cooed, and the birds in the wood\r\nsang their praises to the Creator. Thus do the landscapes of\r\nGainsborough affect us. They are soft and tender as some sweet melody in\r\ntheir discreet intimacy, without colorist effects, as wonderfully\r\nharmonious as nature herself. A thatched cot, that peeps timidly from\r\nbetween the great trees, a silvery dale shut in by weeping willows, a\r\nbridge leading to some lush, green meadow,--those are Gainsborough's\r\nmaterials. The famous \"Cottage Door\" is now at Grosvenor House. A young\r\npeasant woman, with her youngest child in her arms, is standing by the\r\ndoor of a country cottage, before which her other children are playing,\r\nsome half naked; deep contentment is all around, huge old oaks spread\r\ntheir sheltering branches over the roof on both sides; golden rays of\r\nsunshine dance across the meadow. Only Frederick Walker has, in later\r\ndays, painted such peasant women and such children, at once so tender\r\nand so natural. Of the four pictures in the National Gallery, \"The Wood\r\nScene,\" \"The Watering Place,\" \"Market Carts,\" and \"Peasant Children,\"\r\n\"The Watering Place\" is the most celebrated. In the foreground a quiet\r\npasture with cows, close by the herdsman, a Suffolk labourer; in the\r\nbackground a noble old Norman castle, perhaps Hedingham Castle, near\r\nSudbury. It is through pictures like these that England has become the\r\nnative-land of intimate landscape--_paysage intime_.\r\n\r\nAs figure painters, as well as landscape painters, the English in the\r\neighteenth century laid a course of their own, and it was not long\r\nbefore the other nations followed them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORICAL POSITION OF ART ON THE CONTINENT\r\n\r\n\r\nGoethe compared the history of knowledge with a great fugue: the parts\r\nof the nations first come to light, little by little; and this analogy,\r\nalready once made by Hettner, holds true in a very high degree of the\r\nhistory of art during the eighteenth century. The three great nations of\r\nculture--the German, the English, and the French--take up their parts in\r\nturn, and through all there sounds one common, equal, dominant note.\r\nEngland was in the vanguard of that great period of struggle known as\r\nthe age of enlightenment. Since the middle of the eighteenth century\r\nEnglish influences had begun to fertilise the Continent. The truth and\r\nnaturalness of English ideas were introduced as models, and England\r\nbecame in her whole culture the schoolmistress of the Continent. In\r\nevery region war was declared against the pedantry brought over from the\r\npast, while new conditions were aimed at. Obviously it was not so easy\r\nfor other nations to take their stand on the basis of modern society.\r\nEngland had accomplished her revolution in the seventeenth century;\r\nFrance was only preparing herself for hers. For all other nations, too,\r\nthe eighteenth century was a transition period, in which the old and the\r\nnew civilisation of culture were parting--an age of prodigious\r\ncontroversy, full of _Sturm und Drang_. Men did homage to every kind of\r\nextravagance, and went into ecstasies over virtue. The sarcasm of\r\nscoffers went hand in hand with the deepest sentimental feeling for\r\nnature; superstition flourished by the side of enlightenment and\r\nlearning; in the _salons_ of the aristocracy courtly abbés file past\r\nwith the greatest thinkers, glowing with a holy zeal for the rights of\r\nman. And, in the midst of all this contradiction, there exists that\r\nsimple, virtuous middle class which is preparing to make the ascent\r\nwhich will lead it to power.\r\n\r\nOne may imagine oneself in a salon of the _ancien régime_, in which wit\r\nis lord, and laughter and merriment reign. Into that salon enters\r\nabruptly a rough plebeian, with none of the fine tact of that company,\r\nyet a great, aristocratic spirit, a man who despised such a society and\r\nwould make the world anew. Such is one's impression of the effect\r\nproduced at the time by the appearance of Jean Jacques Rousseau.\r\nVoltaire was the first on the Continent to break through social\r\nbarriers, but none the less he coined his heart for gold in society.\r\nRousseau signifies a great advance: he gave up his place, laid aside\r\nrapier, silk stockings, and perruque, and clothed himself after the\r\nmanner of a common man in order to earn his bread as a copier of music.\r\nHe is, as Weigandt has called him, the first man of the _bourgeois_\r\ncentury, the first pioneer of the new age. Against the traditions\r\nbequeathed by the past, which in the course of time had become\r\nover-refined and corrupt, he set up the natural conditions demanded by\r\nreason. His fight against inequalities of rank is, as it were, a\r\nforetaste of the revolution. \"What hellish monsters are these\r\nprejudices. I know no dishonourable inferiority other than that of\r\ncharacter or education. A man who is trained to an honourable mind is\r\nthe equal of the world; there is no rank in which he would not be in his\r\nplace. It is better to look down upon nobility than upon virtue, and the\r\nwife of a charcoal-burner is worthy of more respect than the mistress of\r\na prince.\" Those were words in which the coming revolution was presaged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF GOYA. BY HIMSELF.\r\n\r\n  _From: \"Los Capriccios.\"_]\r\n\r\nThe _Nouvelle Heloise_ appeared in 1761. Thirteen years later followed\r\nGoethe's _Werther_, that history of a young Titan whose zeal for liberty\r\nfelt all the partition walls of Society to be prison walls, and who rose\r\nagainst everything that was ceremonial, against all the subordinations\r\nof the social hierarchy, against all trivial and rigid rules of prudent\r\neveryday life. Werther abhorred rules in every sphere. \"One can say much\r\nin favour of rules, about as much as one can say in praise of\r\n_bourgeois_ society.\" He scoffed at the Philistines, who daily went\r\nalong the same measured way. He saw in \"Society,\" having hitherto moved\r\nin the simple world of the _bourgeois_, \"the most sacred and the most\r\npitiful emotions wholly without clothing.\" And this Society outraged\r\nhim, and sent him with contumely from its midst. \"Working folk carried\r\nhim to the grave, and no minister of religion followed him.\"\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards young Schiller came upon the scene with his first works,\r\nwhich were a declaration of war against all the foundations of human\r\nsociety, those manifestoes of revolution which, were they new writings\r\nto-day, no Court Theatre would dare to produce. The fierce, rampant\r\nlion, with the inscription \"In Tyrannos,\" which was displayed on the\r\ntitle-page of the second edition of the _Robbers_, was an intimate\r\nsymbol of the deep revolutionary spirit that inspired the whole age. \"I\r\ngrew disgusted with this ink-stained age, when I read in my _Plutarch_\r\nof great men. Fie, fie upon the flaccid, castrated century, that has no\r\nother use than to chew over again the deeds of the past. Let me imagine\r\nan army of fellows like you, and I see a republic arising in Germany, in\r\ncomparison with which those of Rome and Sparta would be convents of\r\nnuns.\" In a loud voice _Ficsco_ proclaims itself on the very title-page\r\nto be a \"republican\" tragedy. _Intrigue and Love_ even aims full at the\r\nrottenness and corruption of the actual time. It can be traced--and\r\nBrandes has done it in his _Haupströmungen_--how in the literature of\r\nthe age, the life of sensibility and idealism prevailing in the previous\r\ncentury gradually dwindles, and in its stead quite modern progressive\r\nviews--religious, political, and social--surge up in an ever-increasing\r\nwave. The authors were the bold inciters to the battle. They were all\r\nleaders in the battle for liberty against fossilised tradition,--some in\r\nthe field of poetry only, others in the whole sphere of intellectual\r\nlife. These are they who gave the signal for the war-cry of the\r\nRevolution--Liberty, Equality, Fraternity; who rent asunder the old\r\nsociety, inaugurated the age of citizenship, and were at the same time\r\nthe first to lose, as quite modern spirits, their faith in another\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOYA.   THE MAJAS ON THE BALCONY.]\r\n\r\nA wonderful chance ordained that, in the province of art, the most\r\npowerful figure of that storm and tumult, the one artist of the age of\r\nthe race of Prometheus, to which belonged the young Goethe and the young\r\nSchiller, should be born in the most mediæval country in Europe, on\r\nSpanish soil. Against an art that was more catholic than catholicism,\r\ncourtly and mystical, there came by far the greatest reaction in Goya.\r\nFrom Roelas, Collantes, and Murillo to him there is hardly any\r\ntransition.\r\n\r\n_Francisco Goya_ preached Nihilism in the home of belief. He denied\r\neverything, believed nothing, doubted of everything, even of that peace\r\nand liberty which he hoped to be at hand. That old Spanish art of\r\nreligion and dogma was changed under his hands to an art of negation and\r\nsarcasm. His attitude is not that of an insolent and impetuous youth,\r\nwho puts out his tongue at the Academy and strikes with audacious hand\r\nat the academicians' high powdered perruques; it is the attitude of the\r\nmodern spirit, which begins by doubting all things which have been\r\nhonoured hitherto. His Church pictures are devoid of religious feeling,\r\nand his etchings replete with sneers at everything which was previously\r\nesteemed as authority. He scoffs at the clerical classes and the\r\nreligious orders, laughs at the priestly raiment which covered the\r\npassions of humanity. Spanish art, which began in a blind piety, becomes\r\nin Goya revolutionary, free, modern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_Laurent, photo._)\r\n\r\n  GOYA.   THE MAJA CLOTHED.]\r\n\r\nGoya is, in his whole nature, a modern man, a restless, feverish soul;\r\nnervous as a _décadent_; temperament to his finger-tips. His style in\r\nportraiture, his art of composition, his whole method,--all speak to our\r\nartists to-day in a language easily understood, and on many of them the\r\ninfluence of Goya is unmistakable. He is one of the most fascinating\r\nfigures of the beginning of the century. As audacious as he was clever,\r\nas versatile as he was fantastic, a keen observer as well as a strong\r\ncreative spirit, he fascinates and astonishes in his pictures, just as\r\nin his wonderful etchings, by a remarkable mixture of the bizarre and\r\nthe original. His pictures, whether they be violent or eccentric, tender\r\nor hard, gloomy or joyous, nearly always move and palpitate with life\r\nitself, and they will always keep their attraction. There is no one of\r\nGoya's pictures, not even the flimsiest sketch, at which one can look\r\ncoldly.\r\n\r\nHe was born in a village in the province of Aragon, the son of a small\r\nlanded proprietor, in 1746. At the age of fourteen, having already\r\npainted frescoes in the church of his native-place, he went to Saragossa\r\nas an apprentice; and there he showed himself to be vivacious and\r\npassionate, and soon became the champion among his comrades in all their\r\npastimes and brawls. Restless, and always thinking of adventure, he\r\nrefused every regular kind of education, disarranged everything in his\r\nmaster's studio, worked when he could, drew his sword when he had a mind\r\nto, nourished in his head dark thoughts on liberty, came and went and\r\nloved, dallied with his knife, snapped his fingers at the Inquisition,\r\nwhich was after him, and fled from Madrid,--such was he at twenty, and\r\nsuch he remained all his life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_Laurent, photo._)\r\n\r\n  GOYA.   THE MAJA NUDE.]\r\n\r\nItaly, whither he fled on account of a duel, did not alter him. There\r\nwere new love quarrels. He fought, stabbed a rival, was wounded himself,\r\namused himself extremely, studied little, observed, admired, but neither\r\npainted nor copied anything. It was thanks to this indolence that the\r\ngreat past did not take him prisoner. He did not know much, but for what\r\nhe knew he could thank himself. He loved the old painters, but\r\nplatonically; their works did not lead him astray. In this lies the\r\nexplanation of his qualities and his faults: that marvellous mixture of\r\nseductive grace and visible weakness, of subtlety and brutality, of\r\nrefinement and ignorance. He merits equally sympathy and blame, is as\r\ngenial as he is unequal. But one would not wish him to be otherwise: if\r\nthere had been more order and proportion in his works his good qualities\r\nwould have been lost. He would have suffered in spontaneity, vivacity,\r\noriginality, and quietly taken his anchorage in the sleepy haven of\r\nmediocrity. As he is, he is wholly the child of his country: from head\r\nto foot a Spaniard of the eighteenth century, a son of that downfallen\r\nSpain that was dying from loss of blood. For hundreds of years a black\r\ncloud, extinguishing all joy, had hung over Spanish life, a cloud out of\r\nwhich, only here and there in dismal lightning flashes, there emerged\r\nobscure figures of sombre despots, sick ascetics, and silent martyrs.\r\nAll mundane inclinations were suppressed, all sensuous desires\r\nprohibited. Men spent their nights with their eyes fixed upon the gory\r\nhistories and passionate exhortations of the Old Testament, hearing in\r\nimagination the menacing, thunderous voice of a dreadful God, until at\r\nlast in their own hearts the fanatical inspiration of the prophetic seer\r\nawoke anew, and their feverish forms were torn asunder by ecstatic\r\nvisions and religious hallucinations. When Goya began his career the\r\nsinister country of the Inquisition had grown frivolous. A breath of\r\nrevolution was passing over men's minds. An intoxicating odour of\r\nmundane voluptuousness penetrated everywhere, even into the convents\r\nthemselves; the figures of the French Rococo Olympus had brought\r\nconfusion into the Christian paradise. Spain no longer believed; it\r\nlaughed at the Inquisition, trembled no more when it was threatened with\r\nthe pains of Hell. It had grown frivolous, wanton, epicurean, full of\r\ngrace and laughter. The rosy-red and blue shepherds of the Trianon had\r\nmade an entry into the sombre Court of Aranjuez. Literature, taste, and\r\nart were infected by French influences, Parisian sparks of wit,\r\nlightning _esprit_, and Parisian immorality; and the same rumbling\r\nearthquake which wrecked the throne of France was soon to shatter that\r\nof Spain. In Goya's works there is a refulgence of all this. But, like\r\nevery great artist, he is not only the expression of his epoch, but also\r\nits leader; he almost anticipates the age which shall succeed it. Like a\r\nfigure of Janus, on the border-line between two centuries, standing in a\r\nmanner between two worlds, he was the last of the old masters and the\r\nfirst of the moderns--even in that special sense in which we employ the\r\nword to-day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOYA.   DE QUE MAL MORIRA.\r\n\r\n  _From \"Los Capriccios.\"_]\r\n\r\nThrough a commission to design cartoons for the Spanish manufactories of\r\ntapestry, he was brought into contact with the Court. Member of the\r\nAcademy of San Fernando in 1780, Pintor del Rey, with an income of\r\n12,500 francs in 1786, he became soon afterwards the Director of the\r\nMadrid Academy--the drollest Director of an Academy that man can\r\nimagine! Goya, the peasant youth, with his bull neck and matador-like\r\nstrength, lived at the Spanish Court in the midst of the enervated\r\nscions of a dissolute aristocracy, who, with their sickly and anæmic\r\nfeatures, indolent and impotent, skulked through life, young men\r\nprematurely old. Naturally he was the idol of the women, hated by the\r\ncourtiers on account of his caustic wit, a terror to all husbands\r\nbecause of his perpetual intrigues, and at the same time feared as the\r\nbest swordsman in Madrid, who drew his rapier with the indifference with\r\nwhich we light a cigarette.\r\n\r\nIt is only as the outcome of such a personality that his works are to be\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOYA.   SOPLONES.\r\n\r\n  _From \"Los Capriccios.\"_]\r\n\r\nGoya was far too great a sceptic to put a religious sentiment into\r\nmatters in which he no longer believed; his talent was far too modern\r\nfor the religious abstraction to be able to seize him. His \"Christ on\r\nthe Cross,\" therefore, in the Museo del Prado, is simply tedious, a bad\r\nacademical study. His frescoes in San Antonio de la Florida, at Madrid,\r\nexhibit a pretty, decorative motive--considerable movement, grace, and\r\nspirit. But amongst them are angels who sit there most irreverently,\r\nand, with a laugh of challenge, throw out their legs _à la_ Tiepolo. The\r\nchief picture represents St. Antony of Padua raising a man from the\r\ndead. But all that interested him in it were the lookers-on. On a\r\nbalustrade all around he has brought in the lovely, dainty faces of\r\nnumerous ladies of the court, his _bonnes amies_, who lean their elbows\r\non the balcony and coquette with the people down below. Their plump,\r\nround, white hands play meaningly with their fans; a thick cluster of\r\nringlets waves over their bared shoulders; their sensual eyes languish\r\nwith a seductive fire; a faint smile plays round their voluptuous lips.\r\nSeveral seem only just to have left their beds, and their vari-coloured,\r\ngleaming silks are crumpled. One is just arranging her coiffure, which\r\nhas come undone and falls over her rosy bosom; another, with a\r\nlanguishing unconsciousness and a careless attitude, is opening her\r\nsleeve, whose soft, deep folds expose a snow-white arm. There is much\r\n_chic_ in this Church picture. One very immodest angel is supposed to be\r\nthe portrait of the Duchess of Alba, who was famed for her numerous\r\nintrigues.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOYA.   SE REPULEN.\r\n\r\n  _From \"Los Capriccios.\"_]\r\n\r\nIn his portraits, too, he is unequal. He became the fashionable painter\r\nat the court. The politicians, poets, scholars, great ladies, actresses,\r\nall the famous folk of his epoch, sat to him. He daubed more than two\r\nhundred portraits; but they were good only when the subject amused him.\r\nHis portraits of the Royal Family have something vicious and plebeian.\r\nHe is too little in earnest, too little of an official, to paint court\r\npictures. One might imagine that he with difficulty restrained himself\r\nfrom laughing at the pompous futility which stood before him. It\r\nirritated him to be obliged to paint these great lords and ladies in\r\nposes so ceremonial, instead of making them, like the angels of San\r\nAntonio, throw up their legs and skip over parapets. The Queen, Marie\r\nLouise, is frankly grotesque; and the family of Charles IV look like the\r\nfamily of a shopkeeper who have won the big prize in a lottery, and been\r\nphotographed in their Sunday clothes. But, ah! when something gives him\r\npleasure! In the Exhibition of Portraits at Paris, in 1885, there was\r\nthe portrait of a young man, dressed in gray, which excelled\r\nGainsborough for grace. With what a noble nonchalance this young elegant\r\nstands there, reminding one, in attitude and costume, of the\r\n_incroyables_ of Charles Vernet. With what equanimity does he look out\r\non life, in his satisfaction at the good fit of his clothes. The\r\nwonderful harmony of the grey tones was rendered with all Gainsborough's\r\ndelicacy. The same man who in those pictures of ceremony let himself go\r\nin a manner so brusque and frenzied, here revelled, a very Proteus in\r\nhis chameleon-like qualities, in soft and mellow and seductive tones.\r\nOne might say that he has thought here of Prudhon and Greuze, and joined\r\ntheir study to the cult of Velasquez.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOYA.   QUE PICO DE ORO!\r\n\r\n  _From \"Los Capriccios.\"_]\r\n\r\nStill more charming was he in his pictures of young girls, when he was\r\nhimself fascinated by the attractions of his subjects. The infantile\r\nDonna Maria Josefa (at the Prado) and the twelve-year-old Queen Isabella\r\nof Sicily (at Seville) are admirable pictures. In them the candour and\r\ngrace of budding youth, the whole poetry of young maidenhood, have won\r\nlife and expression from the enamoured tenderness of an artist hand.\r\nSeduced by beauty, he renounced all irony, thought only of those big,\r\nwide-opened eyes of velvet, those rosy young lips; of that warm\r\ncarnation and the elegant slimness of that soft young neck that rose in\r\ndelicate contour from the shoulders. Or again, that marvellous double\r\nportrait of La Maja in the Academy of San Fernando: a young girl painted\r\nonce clothed and once nude, both pictures in exactly the same pose, and\r\nboth flooded with the same extraordinary sensuous charm. This is not the\r\nuncertain, sarcastic painter of those State pictures. It is an attentive\r\nobserver, who depicts with sensitive devotion the harmonious lines of\r\nthe irradiating, young, human body so worthy of celebration. The\r\ntransparent stuff that covers the body of \"La Maja clothed\" reveals all\r\nthat it hides; in the other picture the unveiled nudity sings the high\r\npæan of the flesh. The drawing is sure, the modelling of a marvellous\r\ntenderness. The heaving bosom, the slender limbs, the tantalising\r\neyes--every part of that nervous body, with its ivory whiteness,\r\nstretched out on the milk-white couch made for love, breathes of\r\npleasure and voluptuousness.\r\n\r\nIn pictures of this kind Goya is wholly one of us. Grown independent of\r\nevery traditional rule, he abandoned himself entirely to his own\r\nimpressions, and produced enduring works, vibrating with life, because\r\nhe was himself fascinated with nature. He showed here an idea of\r\nmodernity that almost makes him seem a contemporary of our own--that\r\nzeal for the pictorial, for colour and light, which attracts us so much\r\nto-day. Very characteristic also of the changed aspect of the age are\r\nhis designs for the famous tapestry in Santa Barbara, with which he made\r\nhis début at Madrid. They are very crude in decoration. Two or three\r\nneat young girls, with big, black, moist eyes, here and there pleasing\r\ndetails--a couple of men carrying a wounded companion--are unable to\r\ngloss over the heaviness of the composition and colour. But it was of\r\ngreat consequence that Goya should have had courage for so bold a step\r\nas to make use of character scenes in decorative painting at a time when\r\neverywhere else, without exception, _fêtes champêtres_ predominated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOYA.   VOLAVERUNT.\r\n\r\n  _From \"Los Capriccios.\"_]\r\n\r\nIn his oil paintings he went much further in this direction. In that\r\nimpetuous manner peculiar to him he endeavoured to get a firm grip on\r\nthe pictorial side of Spanish life, at home and in the streets, wherever\r\nhe found it. The most fearful subjects--such as the two great slaughter\r\nscenes in the French invasion, painted with such breadth and\r\nfierceness--alternate with incidents of the liveliest character.\r\nEverything is jotted down, under the immediate influence of what has\r\nbeen observed, by rapid methods, and on this account produces an effect\r\nof sketches taken with complete directness from nature. In those\r\ncareless pictures, swept with large strokes of the brush, there rises\r\nbefore us the mad drama of public holiday in the streets and in the\r\ncircus: processions, bull-fights, brigands, the victims of the plague,\r\nassassinations, scenes of gallantry, national types--all observed with\r\nthe acuteness of a Menzel. The Majas on the balcony in the Montpensier\r\nGallery, the \"Breakfast on the Grass,\" the \"Flower Girl,\" the \"Reaper,\"\r\nthe \"Return from Market,\" the \"Cart attacked by Brigands,\" are the most\r\npiquant, vividly coloured of these pictures. The \"Romeria de San\r\nIsidoro\" is full of such a sparkling, stirring life as the most modern\r\nof the impressionists alone have learned again to paint. A few dashes of\r\ncolour, a few well-placed, bold strokes of the brush, and at once one\r\nsees the procession move, the groups passing each other by just as, in\r\nthe marvellous sketches of the funeral of Sardina, in the Academy of\r\nSan Fernando, one can see the young couples revolve madly in the dance,\r\nand the lances of the bull-fighters redden the sand of the arena.\r\n\r\nThe superabundance of such phantasy could not, of course, be achieved by\r\nthe tardy brush. He required a quicker medium, that would permit him to\r\nexpress everything. Therefore he executed his numerous etchings, by\r\nwhich he was rendered famous, before people had learnt to appreciate him\r\nas a painter: the \"Capriccios,\" the \"Malheurs de la Guerre,\" the\r\n\"Bull-fights,\" the \"Captives\"--those marvellous and fantastic pages in\r\nwhich he expressed everything that his feverish, satirical soul had\r\naccumulated for contempt, and hatred, and anger, and scorn. The etcher's\r\nneedle was the poisoned dagger with which he attacked all that he wished\r\nto attack: tyranny, superstition, intrigue, adultery, honour that is\r\nsold and beauty that lets itself be bought, the arrogance of the great\r\nand the degrading servility of the little. He made an awful and jovial\r\nhecatomb of all the vices and the scandals of the age. Whomsoever he\r\npilloried was laid bare in all respects; physically and morally, no\r\nsingle trait of him was forgotten. And he did it so wittily that he\r\ncompelled even the offended person to laugh. Neither Charles IV himself,\r\nnor the Court, nor the Inquisition, which bled most beneath his thrusts,\r\ndared to complain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOYA.   QUIEN LO CREYERA!\r\n\r\n  _From \"Los Capriccios.\"_]\r\n\r\nIn his \"Capriccios\" Goya stands revealed as a figure without even a\r\nforerunner in the history of art. Satirical representations of popular\r\nsuperstitions, bitter, mordant attacks on the aristocracy, the\r\ngovernment, and all social conditions, unprecedented assaults on the\r\ncrown, on religion and its doctrines, inexorable satires upon the\r\nInquisition and the monastic orders, make up this most remarkable book.\r\nIt had hardly appeared in 1796 before the Inquisition seized it. Goya\r\nparried this stroke, however, by dedicating the plates to the king.\r\n\r\nA painter and a colorist, in this book he displays his genius as an\r\netcher. The outlines are drawn with light and genial strokes only; then\r\ncomes the _aquatinta_, the colouring which overspreads the background,\r\nand gives localisation, depth, and light. A few scratches of the needle,\r\na black spot, a light produced by a spot of white ingeniously left\r\nblank--that sufficed to give life and character to his figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOYA.   LINDA MAESTRA!\r\n\r\n  _From \"Los Capriccios.\"_]\r\n\r\nThe \"Misères de la Guerre\" are intrinsically more serious. All the\r\nscenes of terror that occurred in Spain as a sequel to the French\r\ninvasion and the glory of Napoleon here utter their cry of lamentation.\r\nA few plates amongst them are worthy of comparison with the finest of\r\nRembrandt's,--the sole classic for whom Goya cherished a veneration. All\r\nthe undertakings which followed these--the \"Bull-fights,\" the\r\n\"Proverbs,\" the \"Captives,\" the fantastic landscapes--tell of a long\r\nstudy of the great Dutch master. Especially celebrated were the\r\nseventeen new plates which he added to the \"Malheurs de la Guerre\" in\r\n1814, at the time of the restoration of Ferdinand VII. They are the\r\npolitical and philosophical testament of the old liberal, the keen\r\nfree-thinker, the last and utmost fight for all that he loved against\r\nall that he hated. With sacred wrath and biting irony he waged war\r\nagainst the intrigues and hypocrisy of the obscurantists who throttle\r\nprogress and suppress freedom of thought. With passionate wrath he\r\nrushed upon kings, priests, and dignitaries. It seems incredible that\r\nthe plate entitled \"Nada\"--a dead man, who comes out of his grave and\r\nwrites with his corpse-fingers the word \"Nada\" (nothing)--that this\r\nplate can be the work of a Spaniard of the eighteenth century.\r\nEverywhere there is the same hatred of tyranny, of social injustice, of\r\nhuman stupidity, the same incredulous effort after a dimly conceived\r\nideal of truth and liberty.\r\n\r\nIt is neither the amiable fairyland of Callot nor the _bourgeois_\r\npessimism of Hogarth. Goya is more inexorable and acute; his phantasy,\r\nborne on larger wings, takes a higher flight. He sees direful figures in\r\nhis dreams, his laugh is bitter, his anger rancorous. He is a\r\nrevolutionist, an agitator, a sceptic, a nihilist. His _chronique\r\nscandaleuse_ grows into the epos of the age. One understands why such a\r\nman should no longer feel secure in Spain, and, towards the close of his\r\nlife, go into exile in France.\r\n\r\nThere, too, in the home of the revolution, art, ever since the beginning\r\nof the century, had freed herself more from the tradition of the\r\nRenaissance, and betaken herself to the new way, which the Dutch, and\r\nsoon afterwards the English, had laid down in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOYA.   DEVOTA PROFESION.\r\n\r\n  _From \"Los Capriccios.\"_]\r\n\r\nAll that had been produced in Paris, up to the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, had had its birthplace in the Italy of Leo X. The light of the\r\nItalian Renaissance had suffused France ever since the appearance of\r\nRosso and Primaticcio. Rome had been the cradle of Simon Vouet and\r\nNicolas Poussin. France endeavoured, in rich decoration and masterly\r\nswing of lines, to overtop the Italians, whose formulæ were studied\r\npartly in Rome and partly in the Palace of Fontainebleau, that Rome _in\r\npetto_. Those religious pictures of Lebrun, arranged in panels, appeared\r\nwith their theatrically elegant attitudes and their flowing drapery,\r\nwith their slim, oscillating limbs and their florid gestures. All\r\nOlympus, all the saints and the heroes, were set to work to do honour to\r\nthe great king. Was it necessary to glorify his acts, then it was done\r\nby portraying him as Cyrus or Alexander. The people of the seventeenth\r\ncentury did not exist for painters. Lebrun and Mignard, as inheritors of\r\nRoman culture, hovered over life without seeing it. Their ideals were a\r\nhundred and fifty years old, ingenious variations on the\r\nsixteenth-century pattern.\r\n\r\nThen came the death of the _Grand Monarque_, and with him the tradition\r\nof the Renaissance went also to its grave. The old age was outworn, and\r\nthe new began to supersede it. The world was weary of the majestic, the\r\nstiff, and the pompous, whose glamour had blinded it for sixty years.\r\nThe sun-king was dead, and the sun of the Italian Renaissance had set.\r\nFrench society breathed once more. The ostentation of the court had\r\nbecome an onerous ceremony, the monarchical principle an unendurable\r\nconstraint. The nightmare that had oppressed it, the ennui that had come\r\nfrom Versailles, disappeared. Air and light and mirth penetrated the\r\nsalons. People shook off the heavy yoke of majesty from their shoulders,\r\nabandoned their heroic, ostentatious palaces, and bought themselves\r\n_petites maisons_ in the _Bois_. They had suffered, they wished to be\r\nglad; they had been bored, they wished to be amused. Enough of\r\npater-nosters and stately etiquette! they wished to live. Away with the\r\nantique temples and goddesses of Poussin! away with those devoted\r\nmartyrs who mortified themselves and killed the flesh! Away with the\r\nsemblance of the heroic, with pomp and glamour, with the service of God\r\nand the service of lords! Here's to the service of the ladies. Here's to\r\nthe thatched roofs of farmhouses; the woods in whose thickets one can\r\nlose one's way and exchange a kiss; rosy flesh and little turned-up\r\nnoses; everything which gave a thrill of voluptuousness after the\r\nunapproachable, icy-cold nobility of the past. Long live Love!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_L'Art._\"\r\n\r\n  GOYA.   OTRES LEYES POR EL PUEBLO.]\r\n\r\nSo thought France when Louis XIV was dead, and the man was already grown\r\nup in the Low Countries who was chosen to give a shape to these dreams,\r\nto abolish the ascendency of gods and kings and heroes, and to show the\r\nupper classes their own image reflected in the mirror of art.\r\n\r\n_Antoine Watteau_, who guided the stream of French art into this new\r\nchannel--of the Netherlands--was by birth and training a Fleming. His\r\nbirthplace, Valenciennes, although French territory since the Peace of\r\nNymeguen, resembled in its whole character a Flemish town. In the church\r\nhere he first saw any of Rubens' pictures. Here, through Gérin, he\r\nbecame instructed in Flemish traditions. Rubens and Teniers are the two\r\nmasters from whom his own art sprang. During the years when the war of\r\nthe Spanish Succession had changed the French frontier provinces into a\r\nhuge military camp, he painted soldiers and camp scenes, such as the\r\n\"March\" in the collection of Edmund Rothschild, where a party of\r\nrecruits are straggling along a high plain in a fierce storm. Later came\r\npictures of country life in the manner of Teniers, like the \"Retour de\r\nGuinguette,\" engraved by Chedel, a landscape in which on the right a\r\nparty of rustics are carousing at a table in front of a farmyard, while\r\non the other side half-drunken men and women are going home. Louis XIV\r\nhad made before the pictures of Teniers his well-known _mot_: \"_Otez moi\r\nces magots_.\" Now, through Watteau, the _magot_ makes its entrance into\r\nFrench art. Thus in his chief picture in this manner, \"La Vraie Gaieté,\"\r\nthe figures are unmistakably after Teniers. The men are short and\r\nsturdy, entirely Flemish. Only the costumes have changed with the mode.\r\nBut the women are not in the least Flemish. The clean caps and tidy\r\nkerchiefs, the freshly ironed aprons, and neat little feet that trip so\r\nlightly and quickly along the street that no dirt seems to soil them,\r\ngive these peasant girls a certain desirability in which it is not hard\r\nto discover the transition to French grace. The elegant motions and fine\r\nheads point to that Watteau who was to become soon afterwards the\r\nunsurpassable delineator of feminine coquetry.\r\n\r\nGillot and Rubens led him into the new road. The Teniers-like character\r\nof his figures disappeared, they became gracious and noble. In place of\r\nthe _magot_ came elegant French society. Gillot was the first in Paris\r\nto break with the pompous Louis XIV style, and to begin the\r\nrepresentation of the cheerful life of comedians, to replace the\r\ndwellers in Olympus by characters of the French and Italian stage.\r\nRubens had been the first in his \"Garden of Love,\" of the Dresden and\r\nMadrid Galleries, to invite to the embarkation for the Island of\r\nCythera. Watteau acquired something from everyone he studied, and yet\r\nresembles none. After having hitherto sought his personages on the\r\nhighways and in camps, he was now to become the painter of _fêtes\r\ngalantes_, the painter of \"Society.\" For in his shepherds and\r\nshepherdesses there lives the elegance of France. The gods of the\r\nRenaissance, in whom no one any longer believed, glided into the\r\ncostumes of Harlequin and Pierrette. In lieu of the great and the\r\npathetic there came the small, the gay, the graceful, the dainty. The\r\narchitectural symmetry of composition disappeared, and the stiff\r\nstage-scenery character of landscape vanished. The grave formality of\r\ngeometrical construction is changed into freedom and joyousness, just as\r\nthe rhetorical, exact, measured periods of Boileau were relaxed, under\r\nthe hands of Voltaire, into sentences unconstrained, buoyant, and crisp.\r\nWatteau's art betokened the triumph of naturalism over the mannerism\r\ninto which the French art of the seventeenth century, based on the\r\nItalian Renaissance, had dwindled. As it is said in an old poem--\r\n\r\n  \"Parée à la Françoise, un jour Dame Nature\r\n   Eut le desir coquet de voir sa portraiture.\r\n   Que fit la bonne mère? Elle enfanta Watteau.\"\r\n\r\nWatteau became for French art what, a hundred years before, Rubens had\r\nbeen for Flemish--the deliverer. He delivered them from the oppressive\r\nyoke of the Italian tradition. In his world, where there were no longer\r\nany naked goddesses, but where the corset was opened only just wide\r\nenough to reveal a rosy bosom, there was nothing more left of the past.\r\nIt is no longer antique beauty, no longer the plastic cold of the \"Venus\r\ndi Milo,\" no longer the marble perfection of Raphael's \"Galatea.\" Into\r\nthose tender, feminine hands, into those lace sleeves, out of which\r\nsnow-white arms come languishingly forth, into those slender waists, and\r\nteasing, dimpled chins, something of coquetry, of sensibility, something\r\nsubtle and spiritual, has entered, that seems to transcend physical\r\nbeauty. His young men are tall and supple, his women entirely\r\nindescribable, with their air of quiet roguishness and their exquisite\r\ncoiffures. Quite modern is that distinguished sense for costume which\r\nmade him a leader of fashion. Mysterious landscapes, that exhale peace\r\nand happiness all around! Rightly has Edmond de Goncourt called him a\r\nlyric poet, the great poet of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANTOINE WATTEAU.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATTEAU.   LA PARTIE CARRÉE.]\r\n\r\nIn this way the development proceeded. The pompous representation which\r\nportrait painting had practised hitherto was gone. People would no\r\nlonger be masters of the ceremonies, but human beings. New forms of\r\ntechnique were discovered, such as pastel painting. No other material\r\nwas capable of rendering the peculiar fragrance of this fugitive flower\r\nnature, the graceful appearance of this _rococo_ style, of these ladies\r\nwith the touch of powder in their hair, and their moist, dreamy eyes, as\r\nMaurice Latour, Rosalba Carriera, and later the Swiss, Liotard, painted\r\nthem. Of those who endeavoured, on the model of Watteau's style, to\r\ndepict the life of the fashionable world, none approached the delicacy\r\nof that national genius. _Lancret_ and _Pater_ followed him, but more\r\nroughly, more soberly, more drily. Lancret in his whole conception,\r\ncompared with Watteau, is a homely, often a somewhat cumbrous\r\njourneyman; Pater, an artist of greater elegance, has the fickleness of\r\nthe virtuoso. Both in conviction and in art they lacked that poetic,\r\nglorifying breath which pervades Watteau's creations. In Watteau one\r\n_believes_ that these gracious beings, these tall and nervous cavaliers,\r\nthese amiable coquettes and comely women, actually represent originals\r\nin noble society; whereas in the works of his disciples it often happens\r\nthat the paid model, selected from a lower circle of society, appears to\r\nus to be not congruous with the elegance of her wardrobe. These dancers,\r\nhuntsmen, and noble maidens are not wholly what they should represent.\r\nBut how delicious they are, these French gossips, so long as one is\r\nmindful _not_ to think of Watteau! What grace is theirs too! What innate\r\ntact! With what a pleasant adroitness do they understand how to rivet\r\nour attention, and to keep far, far away from the tedium in which their\r\nclassical ancestors, with their natural heaviness, waded! Instinctively\r\nand without effort they rejected the rhythmically balanced composition\r\nand correct nobility of form of the classics, and found a characteristic\r\nexpression for unconstrained gestures, pleasing movements, and refined\r\nelegance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREUZE.   \"_L'Art._\"]\r\n\r\nEven the decorative painters abandoned more and more the much-worn paths\r\nof the Italians. _François Lemoine_ gave them, by Rubens' aid, the\r\ntransition to a manner peculiarly French, elegant, sensuous, charming.\r\nHis pupil, _François Boucher_, followed him. Like the sons of the\r\nseventeenth century, he made exhaustive use of mythological subjects and\r\nwas often a superficial artist, and in his later works he became\r\nentirely a mannerist; but he was not so at the beginning. It was a great\r\nadvance for France when Boucher gave his pupils the advice to abstain\r\nfrom imitation of the great Italian masters, and not to grow \"as cold as\r\nice.\" And what a great naturalist he is in his numerous drawings and\r\netchings, and in those marvellous groups of chubby children who are\r\nplaying and tumbling about on clouds, or playing musical instruments\r\nshooting arrows, or sporting with flowers! \"It is not every one who has\r\nthe stuff to make a Boucher\" even his great antagonist David has said of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn _Fragonard_, again, there was summed up all the joy of life and the\r\nfrivolity, the lustrous, luxurious talent, the charming amiability and\r\nnimble sureness, of French art in the eighteenth century. Fragonard has\r\npainted everything. His great decorations are careless inspirations,\r\nsparkling with spirit and life. With him pastoral scenes alternate with\r\nepisodes of everyday life--children, guitar players, women reading.\r\nFragonard is a piquant, ingenious painter. Perhaps hardly any other\r\npainter has so much kissing in his pictures. His etching, \"L'armoire,\"\r\nof 1778, is well known. In that he already stood on the sure ground of\r\npopular life. The old rustic, who is armed with a formidable cudgel, is\r\nbeating open, with the assistance of his wife, the doors of a great\r\nclothes cupboard, in which a handsome young fellow has hidden himself;\r\nclose by is a pretty farm girl, weeping in confusion into her apron; in\r\nthe background the curious and amazed little sisters are looking on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREUZE.   THE MILKMAID.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  GREUZE.   HEAD OF A GIRL.]\r\n\r\n_J. F. de Troy_ had, at the same time, abandoned himself to a more\r\nfrolicsome manner, had played upon painting in pictures such as \"The\r\nProposal of Marriage\" and \"The Garter\" with something of that frivolity\r\nwhich later came into fashion through Baudouin. That, however, was only\r\nfor a very short time. Life was beginning to be in earnest--that is\r\nrather the impression one receives much earlier, from turning over the\r\nengravings of those years. Amongst the elders of the actual _rococo_\r\nage, contentment and gaiety still rule. As the heirs of an old\r\ncivilisation, the aristocracy understood, with a refined and unique\r\nunderstanding, how to turn life into a feast. Silk trains rustle over\r\nthe parquet, silk shoes trip, eyes gleam, diamonds flash, white bosoms\r\nheave. Tall cavaliers advance to their sprightly partners, gossip and\r\nsmiles fly around, Knights of Malta and abbés hang over the chairs and\r\npay their court. Yes, this autumn of the old French culture was of a\r\nmarvellous beauty for the fortunate, and those fortunate ones knew, as\r\nno other generation has ever done, how to enjoy life with serenity, in a\r\nfairy glamour of rooms gleaming with Venetian chandeliers, where rosy\r\nCupidons laughed down bewitchingly from their light, gold moulded\r\npanels. Under Louis XVI the French salon acquired another aspect. Its\r\nwalls, its whole architecture, were more sombre. The Cupidons still\r\nsported on the ceiling, but they were forgotten, like ghosts of the\r\npast; their shafts were already impotent. The vivacious, dancing couples\r\nhave disappeared. Festivity has been banished from the big rooms: here\r\nand there is seen an earnest conversational party; gentlemen playing\r\ncards or ladies reading philosophical books. Social and political\r\ninterests have sprung up with which people of education prefer to occupy\r\nthemselves. Numerous works on commerce and constitutional methods have\r\nappeared during the last fifty years. In place of scandal there crop up\r\narguments, for and against the Parliament, for and against the Jesuits.\r\nEnlightenment had won its victory. Henceforth development is no longer\r\ncompatible with sensuous delight. It is still the same society as\r\nbefore, but without pleasure. One almost breathes the air of 1789.\r\nGaming is only a struggle against ennui; the foreheads of women are\r\nfurrowed with reading. Society has grown serious and sombre, as it were,\r\nwith a presentiment of what is to come, as though destiny might thus be\r\nset aside. The writings of Diderot afford the clearest instance of this\r\nchanged spirit of the age, and art too must become virtuous, and work\r\nfor the amelioration of the world. Thus Diderot upheld the sentimental\r\nand emotional subject against the _fêtes galantes_ of the _rococo_\r\npainter. Boucher derived his inspiration from the slough of\r\nprostitution; only a moral upheaval could tend to a high style. With\r\nBoucher the idea of honour, of innocence, has become something strange;\r\nthe new age requires virtue, _bonnes moeurs_. But where are the virtues\r\nto be found? Naturally, there alone, where Rousseau had discovered them.\r\nRousseau taught that man by nature was good, that he was noble,\r\nconscious of his moral obligations, self-sacrificing and uncorrupted\r\nwhen he came from the hands of his Maker, and that it was civilisation\r\nwhich first corrupted him. It followed that the most civilised are the\r\nmost corrupt, and virtues are to be met with, if anywhere, amongst the\r\nlower orders, who are the least affected by culture. Not beneath an\r\nembroidered waistcoat, only beneath a woollen smock, can a noble heart\r\nbeat. The happy ignorance of the young Savoyard, eating his cheese or\r\nhis oranges in a church porch, lies nearer to the original perfection of\r\nmankind than the most subtle erudition of the most ingenious of the\r\nencyclopædists. Amongst nature's noblemen one must seek for the secret\r\nof virtue, which has been lost by the aristocracy in the stream of\r\ncivilisation. Thus beneath the ægis of Rousseau's philosophy the Third\r\nEstate makes its entry into French salons. From the man of the people\r\nsociety wanted to learn how to become once more simple, unassuming, and\r\nvirtuous; and it was a gruesome irony of fate that this \"man of the\r\npeople\" should reveal himself later, when the guillotine stood in the\r\nPlace de la Concorde, as by no means so lamblike, modest, and\r\nself-sacrificing as that noble society had imagined him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  GREUZE.   GIRL CARRYING A LAMB.]\r\n\r\n_Greuze_ represented this phase of French art when the riotous carnival\r\nof _rococo_ had come to an end, and the Ash Wednesday of rule and\r\nfasting and penitence had ensued. It was considered that the aim of art\r\nmust be to instruct and elevate, not merely to amuse; it should set an\r\nexample to raise and inspire the good, to serve as a warning for the\r\nbad. \"_Rendre la vertu aimable, le vice odieux, le ridicule saillant,\r\nvoilà le projet de tout honnête homme qui prend la plume, le pinceau ou\r\nle ciseau._\" In these words Diderot formulated his programme. It was his\r\nwish that the corrupt man, when he went to an exhibition, should feel\r\npricks of conscience at the pictures and read in them his own\r\ncondemnation. \"_Si ses pas le conduisent au Salon, qu'il craigne\r\nd'arrêter ses regards sur la toile._\" Educational effects, \"moral\r\nstories told in pictures,\" that is the keynote of Diderot's demands upon\r\nthe painter, and of the accomplishment of Greuze in answer to this\r\nclaim. He is the French Hogarth, whether he paints in sombre colours the\r\nmisery that the drunkard brings upon his family, and the horrors of\r\npoverty, or depicts in brighter tones the love of children for their\r\nparents and the works of charity; and with him too, as with the\r\nEnglishman, his title was chosen with a didactic after-thought to\r\nheighten the effect of his picture. Thus such scenes as these occurred:\r\n\"The Father's Curse,\" \"The Consolation of Age,\" \"The Son's Correction,\"\r\n\"The Ungrateful Son,\" \"The Beloved Mother,\" \"The Spoilt Child,\" \"The\r\nLame Man tended by his Relations,\" and \"The Results of Good Education.\"\r\nHe had this, too, in common with Hogarth: he liked to develop his moral\r\nstories in long series, which invariably ended with the triumph of\r\nvirtue and the punishment of vice. The didactic story of _Bazile et\r\nThibaut_ attempted to relate in twenty-six chapters the influence of a\r\ngood education on the formation of a whole life; and, just as in\r\nHogarth's story of the two apprentices, here too, at the conclusion, the\r\nwell-educated Thibaut pronounces sentence of death over his old friend\r\nBazile, the badly educated, and now condemned murderer. The fact that in\r\nother things the two moral apostles differ greatly from each other is\r\naccounted for by the difference in the national characteristics of those\r\nto whom they variously appealed.\r\n\r\nHogarth _scourged_ the vices of the Third Estate in order to raise them\r\nto morality. Rape, bloodshed, debauchery, disorderliness, gluttony, and\r\ndrunkenness--that was the channel through which in England at that day\r\nthe furious flood of the uncontrolled spirit of the populace poured\r\nitself, foaming and raging with fearful natural force. Hogarth swung\r\nover these human animals the stout cudgel of morality in the manner of a\r\nsturdy policeman and Puritan _bourgeois_. With such people a delicate\r\nforbearance would have been misplaced. At the foot of every prison-scene\r\nhe inscribed the name of the vice that he had pilloried there, and\r\nsubjoined the predicted damnation from Holy Writ. He reveals it in its\r\nhideousness, he steeps it in its filth, traces it to its retribution, so\r\nthat even the most vitiated conscience must recognise it and the most\r\nhardened abhor it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  GREUZE.   GIRL LOOKING UP.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  GREUZE.   GIRL WITH AN APPLE.]\r\n\r\nGreuze employs the Third Estate as a _mirror of virtue_, sets forth its\r\nnoble qualities as an edification to an aristocracy that has grown\r\nvicious. Less primitive and, for that very reason, less original than\r\nHogarth, he never forgets that he lives in the most refined social\r\nperiod in history. He does not strangle his culprits to provide\r\nterrifying examples, but nearly always leaves a corner open for\r\nrepentance. He knew that he dared not exact too much from the nerves of\r\nhis noble public; he merely wished to stir them to a soft vibration. He\r\ndid not paint for drunken English people, but for those perfumed\r\nmarquises who, later on, bowed with so courtly an elegance before the\r\nguillotine; for those sensitive ladies in whom virtue now excited the\r\nsame sensual delight that vice had done before. They welcomed in him the\r\nhigh priest of a sort of orgie of virtue, to whose festivals they had\r\ngrown reconciled. The century which in its first half had danced as\r\nlight-heartedly as any other the can-can of life, becomes, in its second\r\nhalf, sad of soul, enthusiastic over the reward of justice, the\r\npunishment of transgressors, over honour and the naïveté of innocence.\r\nTime after time do his contemporaries praise precisely that sense of\r\nvirtue in the art of Greuze. So that in France, as in England, the\r\nburden of interest was laid no longer upon the art, but upon an\r\naccessory circumstance. For since, in the hands of Greuze, the picture\r\nhad been turned into an argument, in France, as in England, art ceased\r\nto be an end--it became only a means. He made painting a didactic poem,\r\nthe more melodramatic the better, and was driven thereby on the same\r\nsandbank upon which Hogarth, and all _genre_ painters who _would be_\r\nmore than painters, have made shipwreck. In order to bring out his story\r\nwith the utmost possible distinctness, he was too frequently compelled\r\nunduly to accentuate his point. The effect became affected, the pathos\r\ntheatrical. His picture of the \"Father's Curse\" in the Louvre, with the\r\ninfuriated old man, the son hurrying wildly away, and the weeping\r\nsisters, resembles the last act of a melodrama. \"The Country Wedding,\"\r\nwhere the father-in-law has given the young bridegroom the purse with\r\nthe dowry, and now pathetically observes, \"Take it, and be happy,\" might\r\njust as well have been entitled \"The Father's Last Blessing.\" In the\r\npicture in which a noble dame takes her daughter to the bedside of two\r\npoor persons who are ill, to accustom her in early life to works of\r\ncharity, the personages in the picture, arranged exactly as if upon a\r\nstage, must have been themselves uncommonly moved by the touching and\r\npraiseworthy action. Greuze was the father of _genre_ painting in\r\nFrance--that barbaric, story-telling art which replaced _tableaux\r\nvivants_ based upon the literary idea by the Dutchmen's picturesque and\r\nwell-observed selections from nature. Beyond that, however, it must not\r\nbe forgotten that he, like Hogarth, psychologically opposed to the\r\nearlier art, showed practical progress in many of his works. There were\r\nfew in French art before him who depicted the emotions of the soul with\r\nsuch refinement as Greuze in his \"Reading of the Bible.\" In proportion\r\nto the understanding and character of the individual is the impression\r\nof the listener reflected on his countenance. That was something new in\r\ncomparison with the laughing gods of Boucher. And that Greuze was also\r\ncapable of the most highly _pictorial_ magic when he could once bring\r\nhimself to lay aside the moral teacher is proved by his rosy, inspired\r\nheads of young girls. He never grew weary of painting these pretty\r\nchildren in every situation and attitude at that seductive age which\r\nhides the charming feet beneath the first long gown. Blonde or brunette,\r\nwith a blue ribbon in the hair, a little cluster of flowers in the\r\nbodice, they gaze out upon life with their big, brown child eyes, full\r\nof curiosity and misgiving. A light gauze covers the soft lines of the\r\nneck, the shoulders are as yet hardly rounded, the pouting lips are\r\nfresh as the morning dew, and only the two rosy, budding breasts, that\r\nfight lustily against their imprisonment, and seem, like Sterne's\r\nstarling, to cry, \"I cannot get out,\" betray that the woman is already\r\nawake in the child. Greuze's name will always be associated with these\r\ngirl types, just as that of Leonardo is with the dreamy, smiling\r\nsphinx-like head of Mona Lisa. In them he has given an unsurpassable\r\nexpression to the ideal of innocence at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and provided in them a new thrill of beauty for his\r\ncontemporaries. And a _blasé_ society which had indulged in every\r\nlicence bathed itself with passionate delight in the unknown mystery of\r\nthis surging flood. Yes, after the stimulating champagne of _rococo_,\r\npeople had even come to delight in simple black bread. And so, out of\r\n_bourgeoisie_ itself, a school of painting was developed as fresh and\r\nhealthy as this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _\"Gaz. des Beaux Arts.\"_\r\n\r\n  CHARDIN.   PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF.]\r\n\r\n_Chardin_, the carpenter's son, is at the head of this domestic art in\r\nthe eighteenth century. After Greuze, the painter of refined taste, he\r\nseems, a comfortable, healthy, _bourgeois_ master in whom the Dutchman\r\nof the best period once more appears upon earth.\r\n\r\nAfter the king had, up to the close of the seventeenth century, been the\r\ncentre round which everything turned, the solitary personality which\r\ndared to appear independent, and upon which the rest of the world formed\r\nitself; after the circles round the court had next freed themselves, and\r\ngained the right to enjoy life and art for themselves, there still\r\nremained a third step to surmount. \"Society\" abdicates in favour of a\r\nfree and healthy _bourgeoisie_.\r\n\r\nA surgeon's sign was the first work which brought the young man, who had\r\nreceived no systematic education, into notice. The surgeon is in his\r\nshop attending to a man who has been wounded in a duel, grouped around\r\nare curious bystanders, while the commissary of police investigates the\r\ncase with a grave countenance. It is the first picture of the Parisian\r\nlife of the people. And Chardin, with his middle-class origin, remained\r\nthe advocate of middle-class domestic life. He is the Watteau of the\r\nThird Estate. Greuze owes his success, in the first place, to the\r\ningenious manner in which he made himself the spokesman of the moral\r\ntendency of his age. It interested contemporary society to be told that\r\nit is beautiful to see married folk live together in happiness; that\r\nyoung mothers do a good action in nursing their children, when it is\r\npossible, themselves; that man should repent of his sins; and that he\r\nwho honours his father and mother lives long in the land. Nowadays we\r\nthank him for these wise counsels, but say, at the same time, that we\r\ncould have done without them. We no longer see the necessity of\r\nillustrating the ten commandments, and notice now all the more the\r\nmannerisms, the rhetorical strokes of advocacy which the painter must\r\nemploy in order to plead successfully. Chardin's effect is as fresh\r\nto-day as it was a hundred years ago, because he was a sheer artist, who\r\ndid not seek to tell a story, but only to represent,--a realist of the\r\nfinest stamp, belonging in his exquisite sense of colour values to the\r\nillustrious family of the Terburgs. His pictures have no \"purpose.\" The\r\nwasherwoman, the woman scraping carrots, the housewife at her manifold\r\ntasks--that is Chardin's world; the atmosphere in which these figures\r\nmove, the shimmering light that floats in the half-dark kitchen, the\r\nwealth of sun-rays that play upon the white tablecloths and\r\nbrown-panelled walls--those are his fields of study. Chardin lived in an\r\nold studio, high up near the roof, a quiet, dark room that was usually\r\nfull of vegetables which he used for his \"still life.\" There was\r\nsomething picturesque about the dusty walls where the moist green of\r\nvegetables mingled so harmoniously with the time-worn, sombre brown of\r\nthe wainscoting, and the white table-cloth was flooded with the silvery\r\ngreen which poured in from a little skylight. In this peaceful and\r\nharmoniously toned chamber were laid those small domestic scenes, which\r\nhe so loved to paint, and which were called by the French, in contrast\r\nto the _Fétes Galantes_, \"_Amusements de la Vie Privée_.\" The clock\r\nticks, the lamp burns, water is boiling on the homely tiled stove. There\r\nis an effect in every one of his pictures, as though he had lived them\r\nhimself, as if they were reminiscences of something dear to him and\r\nfamiliar. In contrast to Greuze he shunned all critical moments, and\r\ndepicted only the quiet life of custom, everyday life as it befell in a\r\nconstant, regular routine. There are no hasty movements with him, no\r\ncatastrophes nor complications; he has a preference for \"still life\" in\r\nthe world of men, just as in nature. He is _par excellence_ the painter\r\nof _Intimität_ (intimate life); which is not the same as _a genre_\r\npainter. Painters who in the manner of _genre_ have depicted domestic\r\nscenes in rooms are to be found in every school; but how few have known\r\nhow to depict the poetry of the family life with such truth, with such\r\nan absence of affectation and insipidity! With Chardin art and life\r\nare interfused.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. B. S. CHARDIN   THE HOUSE OF CARDS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARDIN.   GRACE BEFORE MEAT.]\r\n\r\nNo Dutchman, however, had penetrated into the nursery. Chardin, in\r\nsurprising the child-world at their games, in their joys and sorrows,\r\nhas opened out to art a new province. And with what affectionate\r\ndevotion has he not absorbed himself in the spirit of the little people!\r\nI know of no one before him who has painted the unconscious spiritual\r\nlife of the child with such discreet tenderness: the little hands that\r\ngrasp at something, the lips that a mother would like to kiss, the\r\ndreamy wide-open young eyes. In this Chardin is a master. It is not only\r\nobvious expressions of joy and sorrow, but those refined shades, so\r\ndifficult to seize, of observation, thoughtfulness, consideration, calm\r\nreflection, quaintness, obstinacy or sulking, which he analyses in the\r\neyes of the child. There is the little girl playing with her doll, and\r\nlavishing on her all the love and care of a tender mother. There is an\r\nelderly, half-grown-up little lady teaching her younger brother the\r\nmysteries of the alphabet. Then come the games and the tasks. They build\r\ncard-houses, blow bubbles, or are wholly engrossed in their\r\ndrawing-books and home-lessons. How attentive the little girl is whose\r\nmother has just given her her first embroidery materials. How charmingly\r\nembarrassed is the small boy whom she hears his lesson. And what trouble\r\nshe takes in the morning, that her darling shall be clean and tidy when\r\nhe goes to school. In one picture the cap on the little girl's head is\r\ncrooked, and her mother is putting it straight, whilst the child with a\r\npretty pride is peeping curiously in the glass. Again, there is the boy\r\njust saying good-bye. He is neat and well combed; his playthings, too,\r\nhave been nicely tidied up, and his books are under his arm. His mother\r\ntakes his three-cornered hat off again in order to brush it properly.\r\nWhen school is over, you see them sitting at dinner. The table is laid\r\nwith a snow-white cloth, and the cook is just bringing in a steaming\r\ndish. It is touching to see how prettily the small boy clasps his hands\r\nand says his grace. And when they are again off to afternoon school the\r\nmother sits alone. She looks charming in her simple house-dress, with\r\nthe loose sleeves, her clean white apron and kerchief, her striped\r\npetticoat and coquettish cap. Soon she takes her embroidery on her lap\r\nand stoops forward to take a ball of wool out of her basket. Next she\r\nsits before the fire in a cosy corner against a folding screen. A\r\nhalf-opened book rests in her hand, a tea-cup stands close by, a homely\r\natmosphere of the living room hovers round her. Then, like a true\r\nhousewife, she takes up her house-keeping book, or goes into the kitchen\r\nto help the cook, while she scrapes carrots or scrubs the cooking\r\nutensils or brings in the meat from the larder. It is all rendered with\r\nsuch truth and simplicity that one acquires an affection for Chardin,\r\nwho with his art got to the root of family life and bestowed upon it the\r\nsubtlest gifts of observation and generous comprehension, while none the\r\nless his domesticity never became commonplace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DANIEL CHODOWIECKI.]\r\n\r\nHis contemporary, _Étienne Jeurat_, painted scenes at country fairs, and\r\n_Jean Baptiste le Prince_ pictures of guardrooms and similar subjects.\r\nIn Holland _Cornelis Troost_ went on parallel lines with him. He\r\ndepicted the life of his age and of his nation--comic scenes, banquets,\r\nweddings, and the like--in pastels or water colours, and that without\r\nseeking inspiration from any of the Dutch classics, but with a vivid,\r\nintelligent comprehension. Even Italian art ended in two \"_genre_\r\npainters,\" the Venetians Rotari and Pietro Longhi, who have bequeathed\r\nto us such charming little pictures of the life of that\r\nage--fortune-tellers, dancing-masters, tailors, apothecaries, little\r\nboys and girls at play or at their tasks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  CHODOWIECKI.   THE FAMILY PICTURE.]\r\n\r\nGermany presented no such great manifestation as Chardin, although there\r\ntoo the tendency was the same. There too, after the devastation of the\r\nThirty Years' War, a moral, active _bourgeoisie_ had at last sprung up\r\nthat was prepared to take up the line which had been already laid down\r\nby the English. Lessing was the first in this magnificent struggle for\r\nevolution. He wrote, in his _Miss Sarah Sampson_, the first German\r\ntragedy without the support of great mythical or historical heroes, and\r\nwithout the stiff ponderousness of the Alexandrine. He declared, like\r\nMoore, that helmets and diadems do not make tragic heroes; he even in\r\nhis _Minna_ set vividly before the eyes of his contemporaries something\r\nin the immediate present, the Seven Years' War. And just as Lessing\r\nliberated the German drama from the jurisdiction of Boileau, so art\r\nbegan to mutiny against the classicism which had come in through the\r\nmedium of France, and which had been inherited from the age when it was\r\nthe pride of German courts to be small copies of Versailles.\r\n\r\n\"How exceedingly abhorrent to me are our berouged puppet painters,\"\r\ncries the young Goethe, in his essay on German style and art, \"I could\r\nnot sufficiently protest; they have caught the eyes of the women with\r\ntheatrical poses, false complexions, and gaudy costumes; the wood\r\nengravings of manly old Albrecht Dürer, at whom tyros scoff, are more\r\nwelcome to me.... Only where intimacy and simplicity exist is all\r\nartistic vigour to be found, and woe to the artist who leaves his hut to\r\nsquander himself in academic halls of state.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  CHODOWIECKI.   ALL SORTS AND CONDITIONS OF WOMEN.]\r\n\r\n_Daniel Chodowiecki_, with all his commonplaceness, is a genuine\r\nexpression of this phase of German art. He in Germany, Hogarth in\r\nEngland, and Chardin in France, are products of the same tendency of the\r\nage. After Lessing had produced in _Minna_ the first domestic German\r\ntragedy, Chodowiecki, following the road of Hogarth and Chardin, was\r\nable to become the painter of the German middle class. He is not a\r\nmaster of such penetrating strength as they were, but he is no less an\r\nartist of notable merit. He is certainly no genius--in fact almost a\r\nhandicraftsman, sober and philistine, but, like Hogarth, a self-made man\r\nwho in his whole artistic and personal outlook was rooted in the soil of\r\nhis city and of his age. Berlin society of that day was the basis of his\r\nart, the daily life of house and street his domain. He began by\r\nillustrating poems and depicting scenes out of the _Seven Years' War_\r\nand the _History of Charles the Great_, and went on from that to the\r\npleasant, homely life of the small _bourgeoisie_. Himself of the middle\r\nclasses, he chiefly worked for them, and with his sensitive and\r\ndexterous graving tool he kept the liveliest and most exhaustive\r\nchronicle of the German _bourgeoisie_ of that age. At times almost too\r\nreasonable and prosaic, a genuine Nicolai, he has in other plates an\r\nenchanting freshness, and--which should not be forgotten--is more of an\r\nartist than Hogarth, since he is neither moralist nor satirist. His\r\nobject, without any moral after-thought, was the true and kindly\r\nobservation of life as displayed in the world around him. He took the\r\nwholly naïve delight of the genuine artist in turning everything he saw\r\ninto a picture. These chronicles of his have some, it may be but a\r\nparticle, of the spirit of Dürer. Simultaneously, the young _Tischbein_\r\ndelved into the past of the nation, the age of Conradin and the\r\nHohenstaufen, with the intention of finding there the simplicity which\r\nthe academic pictures had come to lack; and, later on, he painted in\r\nHamburg extremely realistic historical pictures of his own period, such\r\nas that which is to be found in the Oldenburg Gallery: \"Entry of General\r\nBenigsen into Hamburg, 1814.\" He did good work too as a portrait\r\npainter. In his best picture, \"Goethe amongst the Ruins of Rome,\" the\r\nhead of the poet is energetic and full of strength, the colouring of an\r\nexcellent clear grey.\r\n\r\nIn portrait painting in general, the revolution is reflected with\r\nespecial clearness. The artificial manner that had been copied from the\r\nseventeenth century, the age of long perukes, gives way, slowly but\r\nsurely, to an ever-growing naturalness, simplicity, and originality. At\r\nthat time, while the spirit of Louis XIV still hovered over everything,\r\nthe passion of the individual to be king in his own sphere had\r\npenetrated into the family. The honest citizen, therefore, would not let\r\nhimself be painted as such, but only as a prince,--he, himself, in gala\r\ndress, with a pompous air, as stately as though he were giving an\r\naudience to the spectator, his wife in silk and gold and lace; she has a\r\ngreat mantle of state worn loose over her shoulders and hips, and looks\r\ndown with an assumption of grandeur on her grandchild, who is half\r\nrespectful and half inclined to make fun. The frame is as rich as the\r\ncostume, and probably bears a crown. We are with difficulty persuaded\r\nthat these are pictures of simple citizens, that the man, apart from the\r\nhours during which he sat to the painter, is an industrious tradesman,\r\nand the wife, glancing out so haughtily, most probably darned his\r\nstockings. Their portraits seem to form part of an ancestral gallery.\r\n\r\nThis age of princely state was followed by that of fraternity. In place\r\nof berouged and postured portraits with allegorical accessories, there\r\nappeared simple, unpretentious likenesses of human beings in their\r\nwork-a-day clothes; in place of stiff attitudes, _genre_ motives with\r\nthe easy naturalness of everyday life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  CHODOWIECKI.   THE MORNING COMPLIMENT.]\r\n\r\nIn Berlin, ever since 1709, _Antoine Pesne_ had been for half a century\r\nthe centre of artistic life, and in his works the revolution may be\r\ntraced. Something familiar and intimate takes the place of that stately\r\npomp. The princes, hitherto, had liked to be represented in mediæval\r\narmour or antique equipment; Pesne painted them in the costume of the\r\ntime. And in his portraits of his friends and his family circle he has\r\nbeen still more unconstrained. There is the charming picture of 1718, in\r\nthe New Palace at Potsdam, which shows the painter himself with his wife\r\nand his two children; the portrait of Schmidt the engraver, in the\r\nBerlin Museum; and the beautiful picture of 1754 in the collection of\r\nColonel Von Berke, at Schemnitz, which depicts him again at the age of\r\nseventy-one with his two daughters. Pesne is revealed in these\r\ncharacteristic portraits, as well as in his character pictures in the\r\nDresden Gallery (\"The Girl with the Pigeons,\" 1728, \"The Cook with the\r\nTurkey-hen,\" 1712), as a thoroughly sane and strong realist, of a kind\r\nwhich became almost extinct in Berlin a hundred years later.\r\n\r\nIn the next generation, in the _Sturm-und-Drang_ period, _Anton Graff_,\r\nthe Swiss, took the lead with his simple, domestic, honest, real\r\nportraits. It was a happy disposition of fate that Graff's activity\r\njust corresponded with the great period of the awakening of intellectual\r\nlife in Germany, that Lessing and Schiller, Bodmer and Gessner, Wieland\r\nand Herder, Bürger and Gellert, Christian Gottfried Körner and Lippert,\r\nMoses Mendelssohn and Sulzer, and a long succession of other poets and\r\nscholars of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century,\r\nfound in him a portrait painter whose quick and agile hand left us their\r\nfeatures in the truest and most authentic manner. What and how robust\r\nhis art is, how clear and plastic the execution of the heads, how adroit\r\nand infallible the technique!\r\n\r\nBesides Graff, there worked in Dresden _Christian Leberecht Vogel_,\r\nlikewise a most independent, picturesque, and sensitive artist, who, if\r\nonly for his pictures of children, deserves a place of honour in the\r\nhistory of art in the eighteenth century. In the portrait of his two\r\nboys, in the Dresden Gallery, the naïveté of child-life is observed with\r\nsuch tenderness and rendered with such vigour as only Reynolds\r\nunderstood. The boys are sitting close together on the ground. One, in a\r\nbrown frock, is holding a book on his knees, which the other, in a red\r\nfrock, with a whip in his hand, is looking at. The thoughtful expression\r\nof the little ones is quite charming; the execution broad and strong,\r\nthe colour treatment delightful and tender.\r\n\r\nIn Munich lived the excellent _Johann Edlinger_, the most industrious of\r\nthese sturdy masters, who were so modest and yet so capable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  CHODOWIECKI.   THE ARTIST'S NURSERY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux Arts._\r\n\r\n  ANTOINE PESNE.   PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF AND DAUGHTERS.]\r\n\r\nIn the domain of landscape the Continent produced no one who could be\r\ncompared with Gainsborough; but here, too, the English influence made\r\nitself felt. It can be traced how the same feeling for nature which had\r\ngiven birth to Thomson's _Seasons_ and Gainsborough's landscapes,\r\nafterwards found expression in France and Germany, and dissipated the\r\nprevailing taste in gardens. The seventeenth century--with the exception\r\nof the Dutch--had set nature in order with the garden shears. As Lebrun\r\nin his historical compositions endeavoured to outdo the Italians, so\r\nLenôtre's garden style exemplified the perfection and exaggeration of\r\nthe gardens of the Italian Renaissance, which themselves again were laid\r\nout on the plan of the old Roman gardens from existing descriptions. A\r\ngarden reminded one more of state apartments, which one could only walk\r\nthrough with measured steps, quietly and respectfully, than of nature,\r\nwhere one is, and dares to be, human. Corresponding to this formally\r\nplanned, correctly measured style of garden there was a school of\r\nlandscape which improved nature on \"artistic\" principles, and, by the\r\narrangement of bits of nature, produced a world peculiarly full of\r\nstyle. Landscapes were nicely laid-out parks, which, like the figure\r\npictures, made for an abstract beauty of mass and lines, and which, by\r\nmeans of accessories, such as classical ruins, would turn one's thought\r\nto the ancient world. Nature must not, as Batteux taught, be the\r\ninstructor of the artist, but the artist must select the parts and build\r\nup his picture. Out of many leaves he takes only the most perfectly\r\ndeveloped, puts only such perfect leaves on one tree, and so obtains a\r\nperfect tree. Let the essential of his production be _nature choisie_, a\r\nselection of objects that \"are capable of producing agreeable\r\nimpressions\"; his aim \"_le beau vrai qui est représenté comme s'il\r\nexistait réellement et avec toutes les perfections qu'il peut\r\nrecevoir_.\" The eighteenth century went back from this \"noble,\"\r\nimproved nature, step by step to the divine beauty of unimproved nature;\r\njust as those masters untouched by the Romans, Dürer and Altdorfer,\r\nTitian and Rubens, Brouwer and Velasquez, had painted her. The great\r\nWatteau, too, was here for the most part in advance of his age, in that,\r\ninstead of the stiffly designed stage scenery of Poussin, he gave\r\nElysian landscapes,--abodes of love, that now glisten in the sunshine of\r\nthe young morning, now are suffused with golden light and the misty\r\nshadows of the evening twilight. The rose in her young bud is odorous,\r\nthe nightingale sings, the doves coo, the light boughs whisper to the\r\nsoft west wind, bright silver rivulets ripple, the wind sighs through\r\nthe tall branches. Watteau knew nature and loved her, and rendered her\r\nin her transparent beauty with the intoxicated eyes of a lover. The\r\nspirit of nature, not of humanity, dominates in his pictures. It is only\r\nbecause nature is so lovely that man is so happy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._ _Photo, Mansell._\r\n\r\n  WATTEAU.   THE MUSIC PARTY.]\r\n\r\nBut still more modern is the effect, when instead of painting Elysian\r\nlandscapes with happy inhabitants, he drew mere bits of rural nature,\r\npoor solitary regions in the neighbourhood of big towns, where\r\nbricklayers are working on the scaffolding of some house, or peasants\r\nare riding with their horses over some stony byway. Out of a number of\r\nspirited drawings, this side of his perception in landscape is\r\nespecially notable in the picture in the New Palace at Potsdam, in the\r\nleft background of which a small stream flows past a farmhouse, whilst\r\nin front a peasant is laboriously dragging a two-wheeled cart over the\r\nrough ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._ _Photo, Mansell._\r\n\r\n  WATTEAU.   THE RETURN FROM THE CHASE.]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe, at that time, after Watteau and his\r\nEnglish predecessors, the widespread growth of this new feeling for\r\nnature. Thomson was followed by Rousseau, who, on his lonely wanderings,\r\nlooked with moved eyes at \"the gold of the corn crop, the purple of the\r\nheather, the majesty of the trees, and the wonderful variety of flowers\r\nand grasses.\" He delighted in the blossoming of spring, the copses and\r\nrivulets, the song of birds, shady woods, and the landscapes of autumn,\r\nwhere the reapers and vine-dressers were working. He is the author of\r\nthat lively feeling for nature that henceforth was aroused through the\r\nwhole of Europe. A breath of pure mountain air, a wholesome draught of\r\nfresh water from Lake Leman, were brought suddenly into the sultry\r\natmosphere of salons, and filled people's hearts with a new and charming\r\nsensation when Rousseau's works appeared. It was over with all efforts\r\nof \"stylists\" as soon as Rousseau declared that everything was good just\r\nas it came out of the lap of the universal mother, nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATTEAU.   FÊTE CHAMPÈTRE.]\r\n\r\nGoethe, the pupil of Rousseau, presages, in his whole conception of\r\nnature, something of the manifestation of the school of Fontainebleau.\r\nHe had something of Daubigny when, as Werther, he lies on the bank of\r\nthe stream and looks down thoughtfully at the worms and small\r\ninsects. He makes one think of Dupré or Corot when he says: \"As nature\r\ndeclines upon autumn, within me and around me it grows autumn\"; or, \"I\r\ncould not now draw so much as a stroke, and I have never been a greater\r\npainter than at the present moment\"; or, \"Never have I been happier, nor\r\nhas my perception of nature, down to the pebble or the grass beneath me,\r\nbeen fuller and more intimate. Yet,--I know not how I can express\r\nmyself, everything swims and oscillates before my soul, so that I can\r\nseize no outline. A great, shadowy whole waves before my soul, my\r\nperception grows indistinct before it, even as my eyes do.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GESSNER.   LANDSCAPE (ETCHING).]\r\n\r\nThus were the French gardens delivered by the English. Just as figure\r\npainting renounced lofty, architectural, formal composition, so those\r\nbisected and upholstered gardens were supplanted by irregular and, as it\r\nwere, accidental bits of nature. People took no more trouble, in\r\nRousseau's phrase, \"to dishonour nature by seeking to beautify her,\" but\r\nlaid out gardens in harmony with Goethe's remark in _Werther_: \"A\r\nfeeling heart, not a scientific art of gardening, suggested the plan.\"\r\nClose to Versailles, near the box-tree patterns of Lenôtre, lay the\r\nPetit Trianon, with its pond, its brook, and its dairy, where the\r\nunfortunate Marie Antoinette used to dream. And if painting still\r\nloitered on its preliminary return to nature, that only implied that the\r\ngreat artists--they only came in 1830!--were not yet born. Great artists\r\ncan only raise themselves on the shoulders of their predecessors, whose\r\nvalue lies in their utility. The French landscapes of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, seen in the light of historical development, are of no\r\nimportance; but, nevertheless, they gave a considerable stimulus in\r\nthat they sought to animate the style of Poussin with a closer\r\nperception of nature. Hubert Robert is certainly strongly decorative,\r\nbut he has a light touch; one cannot take him at his word, but he is\r\nintelligent, and has sometimes grey and green tones that are soft and\r\nbeautiful. Joseph Vernet painted coast scenery, views of harbours,\r\nstorms at sea, likewise with decorative, superficial effects of light;\r\nhe let flashes of lightning streak black clouds, sun-rays dance over\r\nlightly ruffled waves, silver moonshine play mysteriously upon the\r\nwater, and caused conflagrations to break out and red flames to shoot up\r\nto heaven. He is somewhat inane and motley in his colouring. But he had\r\nceased to see in the parts of nature nothing but materials for the\r\nconstruction of nicely fitting scenery. He no longer attempted to speak\r\nto the reason by means of lines, but to touch the soul through humour,\r\nand he employed in his scenery not only buildings and ruins, gods and\r\nancient shepherds, but also modern groups of every kind.\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland, the charming etchings and water-colours of _Solomon\r\nGessner_ must be especially mentioned. Ludwig Richter, indeed, pointed\r\nthem out as the eighteenth century works which, after the engravings of\r\nChodowiecki, he loved the best. Gessner venerated Claude, and had an\r\nenthusiasm for Poussin, but his pictures have no traces of the lofty\r\nstyle of the heroic school of landscape. He sketched his native meadows,\r\ntrees, and brooks; he loved all that was small and secluded and cosy,\r\narbours and hedges, quiet little gardens and idyllic nooks. He\r\napproached everything with a very childlike and faithful observation of\r\nnature. A second Swiss, Ludwig Hess, dedicated a similar subtile sense\r\nof nature and loving zeal as much to his native Switzerland as to the\r\nRoman Campagna.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GESSNER.   LANDSCAPE (ETCHING).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L'Art._\r\n\r\n  GUARDI.   VENICE.]\r\n\r\nThe German _Philip Hackert_ has been prejudiced rather than profited by\r\nthe monument which Goethe erected to him. As Goethe's enthusiasm was not\r\nin due proportion with Hackert's importance, he ceased later to attract\r\nattention, though this he did not merit, as he was always a vigorous and\r\nhealthy landscape painter. He did not see nature with the tender\r\nsensibility of the Swiss. He looked at a landscape somewhat insipidly,\r\nas Chodowiecki at his models. But his drawing is sober, the atmosphere\r\nof his pictures clear and fresh; he cannot be tedious in his\r\ncomposition. In Dresden there lived Johann Alexander Thiele, who roamed\r\nthrough Thüringen and Mecklenburg as a landscape painter. Even in Italy\r\nlandscapes were the most independent performances which the eighteenth\r\ncentury had brought forth there. There worked in Rome the Netherlander,\r\nVanvitelli, who depicted in graceful water-colours Roman and Neapolitan\r\nstreet life; and Giovanni Paolo Pannini, the _peintre des fêtes\r\npubliques_, in whose pictures groups of richly coloured figures moved\r\nthrough splendid palaces. Venice was the home of the Canaletti. In\r\n_Antonio Canale's_ town pictures of Venice, Rome, and London there is at\r\nonce so subtle an atmospheric movement, the water is so clear, the air\r\nso transparent, that even if they represent mere streets and buildings,\r\nthey yet leave an impression of landscape achieved in a broad, pictorial\r\nmethod. _Bernardo Canaletto_ produces an effect by the fine, cool, damp\r\nlight of his northern studies even simpler and more intimate, while by\r\nhis discovery that sunshine does not--as it was hitherto believed--gild\r\nbut silver the object it falls on, he became one of the fathers of\r\nrealistic landscape. The most ingenious, however, of the school of\r\nCanale, not to say one of the cleverest landscape painters of the\r\ncentury, was _Francesco Guardi_. Antonio Canale was a great artist, and\r\nshows it never better than in his distinguished etchings, but as a\r\npainter he interests the collector more than the connoisseur. There his\r\nqualities are too often petrified into an excessive formality; he shows\r\nsomething too much of the _camera obscura_. Guardi is ingenious and\r\nstartling. Where you have accuracy in Canale, in him you find spirit.\r\nCanale shows us the real Venice, Guardi shows it as we have dreamed it\r\nto be. He has not Canale's knowledge of perspective and architecture,\r\nbut he fascinates us. He is a musician and a poet whose palette resounds\r\nwith the purest harmonies. In his pictures the whole seductive legend of\r\nthe fallen Queen of the Adriatic abides. Garlanded gondolas glide\r\npeaceful and fairy-like, majestic as vessels in some distant wonderland,\r\nover the clear, green water of the canals, beneath the high, marble\r\npalaces, which mirror their columns and balconies, their arches and\r\ntheir loggias in the stream. Foreign ambassadors pass in great state\r\nthrough the Piazza di San Marco; all that proud, Venetian nobility\r\ngreets them; and thick throngs of people in their Sunday attire move to\r\nand fro beneath the Hall of the Procuration. Gay bands of musicians row\r\nalong the Piazzetta and the Riva. A moist breeze sweeps over the water;\r\nthe sunshine, now subdued and mellow, now dancing coquettishly, plays\r\nupon the water or on the houses. Francesco Guardi, the magician of\r\nVenice, is an animated, exquisite, always ingenious _improvisatore_,\r\nstrong as few others are in the direct transference of his personal\r\nimpression to canvas. Every stroke of his brush takes effect,--in each\r\none of his pictures one sees the nervous exaltation of the hand; and\r\nthat gives him a power of attraction which, compared with Canale, is\r\nlike that of the clay model, in which the hand of the sculptor is still\r\nperceptible, compared with the cold, marble statue.\r\n\r\nEven Spain, which, except for the colossal figure of Velasquez, had so\r\nfar produced no painters of landscape--even Spain, after the middle of\r\nthe century, turned into this road. _Don Pedro Rodriguez de Miranda_\r\npainted his broad, clear, and vigorously observed highland studies; _Don\r\nMariano Ramon Sanchez_ his small views of towns and harbours.\r\n\r\nAnd, as in England, hand in hand with that came paintings of animals.\r\n\r\nIn France, _François Canova_ was working, the painter of huge battle\r\nscenes and small pictures of animals; _Jean Louis de Marne_, who was\r\nfamous for his cattle, market scenes, village pictures, and the like;\r\nand the great _Jean Baptiste Oudry_, who painted with breadth and\r\nfreedom animals alive and dead, wild and tame, still-life of every kind.\r\nIn Augsburg lived _Johann Elias Riedinger_, whose field of activity\r\nembraced the entire animal world, dogs and horses, stags and roes, wild\r\nboars, chamois, bears, lions, tigers, elephants, and the\r\nhippopotamus--which he depicted with fine observation, both in their\r\nproud solitude and at strife with men.\r\n\r\nIf we cast one more glance back to the road which art had travelled\r\nsince the commencement of the century, we can have no doubt as to the\r\nend which was proportionately aimed at in all countries. Until quite\r\nrecently a courtly, aristocratic art had shed its light upon the whole\r\nof Europe. In the seventeenth century the Dutch alone had maintained\r\ntheir isolation. They who entered fresh into art, and had to break with\r\nno tradition, gave at that time the first expression to the new spirit,\r\nin that they resolutely recalled art from its courtly surroundings to\r\nthe humbler dwellings of the middle classes. They _painted_ what Dürer\r\nand the \"little masters\" had only graved upon wood blocks and copper\r\nplates. Still, they wished to paint these things less for their own\r\nsakes than because so intimate a light was shed upon them. Through\r\nelements of light they contrived to cast over everyday moments a sort of\r\nfairy inspiration. Watteau and his successors made a further advance in\r\nthe conquest of the visible world, in that they desired to paint their\r\nage, for its own sake, in all its grace; and by the middle of the\r\ncentury we find this new, intimate, familiar art, independent of ancient\r\ntradition, triumphing all along the line. \"Sublime\" painting is more and\r\nmore forsaken. Art becomes more and more indigenous to her world and\r\nage. Aristocratic Watteau is succeeded by Hogarth, Greuze, Chardin, and\r\nChodowiecki, who treat the Third Estate no longer in the Dutch\r\n_chiaroscuro_, but in all its heavy reality as a valid object of art.\r\nInstead of that lofty, majestic, vainglorious painting of mere\r\nrepresentations, which was the outcome of Cinquecento, and which at the\r\nexpiration of the seventeenth century had sunk, through abstraction,\r\ninto something uniform, trivial, and tedious, there appeared on all\r\nsides an art which was simple and sincere, which plunged into the life\r\nof every day, observed man in his relations with nature, with his\r\nfellows, with his faithful animals, and with his household goods--an art\r\nwhich created the variety of its representations out of its own\r\nexperience. So with landscape, the most modern branch of art; it reached\r\nin the schools of all nations a greater significance--at least, in\r\nextent--than it had ever possessed in the history of art. And this\r\ndevelopment proceeded without its being established that any one country\r\nhad direct influence on any other. The ideas hung in the atmosphere;\r\nthey were the ideas of the century. It is as though the departing age\r\nwould hold a mirror before us--a magic mirror--which foretells the\r\nfuture; as though it would point out that nineteenth century art,\r\nadvancing further along this road, should be domestic-human, and that it\r\nshould find in landscape its most appropriate expression.\r\n\r\nIt was not given to painting to proceed straight forward in this course,\r\nfor through favour, partly of the changed current of literature, partly\r\nof the revolution, the flame of reactionary classicism shot up brightly\r\nonce more before it expired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE CLASSICAL REACTION IN GERMANY\r\n\r\n\r\nA hundred years ago there lived a man of the name of Asmus Carstens; and\r\nhe was the pioneer and founder of the new German art. That has become\r\nsince Fernow a standing maxim in manuals of the history of art.\r\nDilettantism, however, is not an element, but an end. It is on this\r\naccount, therefore, that later times will see in Carstens, not a\r\npioneer, but only one of the close followers of that tendency of which\r\nthe founders were the brothers Caracci, and the offshoots Lebrun,\r\nLairesse, and Van der Werff. It is, at all events, historically clear\r\nthat Hogarth and Gainsborough, Watteau, Greuze, Chardin, and Goya were\r\nthe men to whom the future belonged. Their art survived the overthrow of\r\nthe Classicalism represented by Mengs and Carstens, which, through\r\nexternal circumstances, once more got the upper hand for a short time,\r\nand it became the foundation on which, after the disappearance of this\r\ntendency inherited from the past, the moderns built further. The former\r\nrepresented progress, because they moved forwards; Carstens and David,\r\nreaction, because they looked backwards--backwards to an age which had\r\nlong ago been buried.\r\n\r\nThere is always danger to a living art in the contact with any great art\r\nof the past. Only those who are themselves highly gifted may hope to\r\nemulate the great ones of the earlier centuries; lesser geniuses perish\r\nin the attempt. Painters like Leonardo and Raphael, like Titian and\r\nPoussin, taking the Greeks as their masters, produced immortal works,\r\nand Goethe and Schiller proved to us that the Hellenic spirit is still\r\nalive and active in our midst. But would anyone dare to mention Mengs\r\nand Carstens in the same breath with these giants?\r\n\r\nThe close of the eighteenth century was a period of antiquarian revival.\r\nThe ruins of Pæstum had been brought to light, Greek vases and Roman\r\nmonuments had become known to the public by the works of Hamilton and\r\nPiranesi. In 1762 Stuart and Revett published their splendid work on the\r\n_Antiquities of Athens_. To a German, however, was to fall the honour of\r\nbecoming the hero of the archæological period. The _History of Ancient\r\nArt_, by Johann Joachim Winckelmann, appeared in 1764, and this writer\r\ndevoted his literary energies to the hymning of the glories of the\r\nre-discovered treasures of antiquity. In the realm of pictorial art he\r\nmay also be looked upon as the chosen of fate. Already, nine years\r\nbefore the appearance of his _History of_ _Art_, he had given, at the\r\nage of thirty-eight, his first writing to the world, _Thoughts upon the\r\nImitation of Greek Works_, in which the reformation motive is epitomised\r\nin this sentence: \"The sole means for us to become--ay, if possible,\r\ninimitably great--is the imitation of the ancients.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Winckelmann the stone kept on rolling. \"In Greek sculpture the\r\npainter can attain to the most sublime conception of beauty, and learn\r\nwhat he must lend to nature in order to give dignity and propriety to\r\nhis imitation,\" writes Solomon Gessner in 1759. In 1762 Hagedorn of\r\nDresden deplored, in his _Treatise on Painting_, that \"Terburg and Metsu\r\nnever showed us fair Andromache amongst her industrious women, instead\r\nof Dutch sempstresses.\" In 1766 Lessing wrote his _Laocoön_, and, like\r\nWinckelmann, saw in the sculpture of the Greeks the ideal to be\r\nimitated. From this point forward he despised landscape and _genre_\r\npainting, and especially everything which illustrates intimate emotions\r\nand actions, and would confine the composition of pictures to an\r\narrangement of two or three \"ideal figures which please by physical\r\nbeauty.\" Soon afterwards, with almost astonishing partiality, Goethe\r\nintervened in a notable manner on behalf of Classicism with the most\r\nflagrant contradiction of the ideas of his youth. \"Nature alone,\" he had\r\nsaid in _Werther_, \"makes the great artist\"; and in his essay upon\r\n_German Method and Art_ he aimed this sentence at Winckelmann and his\r\nfollowers: \"You yourselves, admirable beings, to whom it was given to\r\nenjoy the highest beauty, you are hurtful to genius; it will be raised\r\nup and borne along on no strange wings, were they even the wings of the\r\ndawn.\" In the same essay occurs the beautiful passage: \"If art is\r\nproduced out of an inward, single, independent conception, untroubled\r\nby, unconscious indeed, of, all that is extraneous, then whether she be\r\nborn of rough wildness or of cultivated sensibility, she is complete and\r\nliving.\" Soon afterwards he wrote again these great words: \"Rembrandt\r\nappears to me in his biblical subjects as a true saint who saw God\r\npresent everywhere, at every step, in the chamber and in the fields, and\r\ndid not need the surrounding pomp of temples and sacrifices to feel\r\ndrawn towards Him,\"--an observation made at a time when the academic and\r\nerudite writer on art was still for years to perceive in the biblical\r\npictures of the great Dutchman only a crude conception of form. In\r\nanother passage, upon the frescoes of Mantegna, in the Church of the\r\nAnchorite, at Padua, there occur the following sentences, showing the\r\ndeepest historical perception: \"How sharp and sure a modernity stands\r\nout in these pictures! From this modernity, which is quite real, and not\r\nmerely seeming, with factitious effects, speaking only to the\r\nimaginative faculty, but solid, detailed, and conscientiously\r\ncircumscribed, and which at the same time has something austere and\r\nindustrious and painstaking--from this issued subsequent painters such\r\nas Titian; and now the liveliness of their genius, the energy of their\r\nnature, enlightened by the spirit of their predecessors, built up\r\nthrough their strength, was able to soar ever higher and higher, to rise\r\nfrom earth and create divine but real figures.\" But, alas! later on he\r\ndid not draw the conclusion which followed quite logically from these\r\nobservations for the judgment of contemporary German art. He came back\r\nfrom Italy as a disciple and follower of Winckelmann's writings on art.\r\n\"Art has once for all, like the works of Homer, been written in Greek,\r\nand he deceives himself who believes that it is German.\"\r\n\r\nSomething pagan entered into his soul, a breath from the calm of\r\nOlympus. He derided his earlier Gothic inclinations, contemptuous of all\r\nthat was opposed to Greek notions of form, mild and indulgent to all\r\nthat bore at least the outward semblance of the antique. He preferred a\r\ncold ideal manner to what was natural, and held Greek art the absolutely\r\nvalid model. From it should be derived a fixed canon, a table of\r\naccepted laws, to be the standard for the artist of our own days, and of\r\nevery age. The _Prize Essays_, which he published with Heinrich Meyer in\r\nthe _Propyläen_, and later in the _Jena Literary Journal_, required the\r\ntreatment of subjects exclusively from the Hellenic legendary cycles,\r\n\"whereby the artist should become accustomed to come out from his own\r\nage and surroundings\"; the composition of pictures was to correspond\r\nstrictly with the style of the antique frieze.\r\n\r\nAmongst his contemporaries voices were not wanting to point out how\r\nfatal this programme was. Notably, Wilhelm Heinse, in 1776, wrote this\r\ngolden sentence: \"Art can only direct itself to the people with whom it\r\nlives. Every one works for the people amongst whom fate has thrown him,\r\nand seeks to plumb its heart. Every country has its own distinctive art,\r\njust as it has its own climate, its scenery, its own taste, and its own\r\ndrink.\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Klopstock opposed Winckelmann's theories in these lines--\r\n\r\n  \"Nachahmen soll ich nicht und dennoch nennet,\r\n   Dein ewig Lob nur immer Griechenland.\r\n   Wem Genius in seinem Busen brennet,\r\n   Der ahm' den Griechen nach!--der Griech' erfand.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in the _German Republic of Letters_, in the chapter \"On High\r\nTreason\": \"It is high treason for any one to maintain that the Greeks\r\ncannot be surpassed.\" In a letter to Goethe, in the year 1800, Schiller\r\nwrote: \"The antique was a manifestation of its age which can never\r\nreturn, and to force the individual production of an individual age\r\nafter the pattern of one quite heterogeneous, is to kill that art which\r\ncan only have a dynamic origin and effect.\" Madame de Staël, in her book\r\non _Germany_, says: \"If nowadays the fine arts should be confined to the\r\nsimplicity of the ancients, we should not then be able to attain to the\r\noriginal strength which distinguished them, while we should lose that\r\nintimate, composite feeling for life which is especially found in us.\r\nSimplicity in art would easily turn with the moderns into coldness and\r\naffectation, whereas with the ancients it was full of life.\" In 1797\r\nCounsellor Hirth published in Schiller's _Horæ_ his well-known treatise\r\non _Beauty in Art_, which, in opposition to the inanimate type of beauty\r\nof Winckelmann, upheld the characteristic as the first principle in art.\r\nMost remarkable, however, is the breadth of historical outlook which was\r\npeculiar to Herder, and the stern actuality with which in his _Plastik_,\r\nand in the _Vierten_ _Kritischen Wäldchen_, he turned against \"those\r\npitiful critics, those wretched and narrow rules of art, that\r\nbitter-sweet prattle of universal beauty, through which the younger\r\ngeneration is being ruined, which is nauseating to the master, and\r\nwhich, nevertheless, the rabble of connoisseurs takes in its mouth as\r\nwords of wisdom.... Shadows and sunrise, lightning and thunder, the\r\nbrook and the flame the sculptor cannot model; but is that therefore to\r\nbe a reason why it should not be done by the painter? What other law has\r\npainting, what other power and function, than to depict the great scheme\r\nof nature with all her manifestations, in their great and beautiful\r\naspect? And with what magic it does this! They are not clever who\r\ndespise landscape painting, the fragments of nature of the great harmony\r\nof creation, who depreciate it or entirely forbid it to the sincere\r\nartist. Is a painter not to be a painter? Is he to turn statues with his\r\nbrush, and fiddle with his colours, just as it may please their antique\r\ntaste? To represent the scheme of creation seems vulgar to them; just as\r\nthough heaven and earth were not better than an old statue.... Doubtless\r\nGreek sculpture stands in the sea of time like a lighthouse, but it\r\nshould be only a friend and not a commander. Painting is a scheme of\r\nmagic, as vast as the world and as history, and certainly not every\r\nfigure in it can or ought to be a statue. In a picture no single figure\r\nis everything; and if they are all equally beautiful, no one then is\r\nbeautiful any longer. They become a dull monotony of long-limbed Greek\r\nfigures with straight noses, who all stand there and parade and take as\r\nlittle part in the action as possible. Now, when this misrepresentation\r\nof beauty cries scorn at the same time upon the whole conception, upon\r\nhistory, upon character, upon action, and this openly attacks that as a\r\nlie, there comes a discord, something insupportable, into painting,\r\nwhich certainly the antique pedant is unaware of, but which is felt all\r\nthe more by the true friend of the antique. And finally, our own actual\r\nage, the most fruitful subjects of history, the liveliest characters,\r\nall feeling of a simple truth and precision, will be _antiquarianised_\r\naway. Posterity will stand and gape at such fantasies in practice and\r\ntheory, and will not know what we were, in what age we lived, nor what\r\nbrought us to this wretched folly, to the wish to live in another age,\r\nin another nation and climate, and thereby to abandon, or vitiate\r\ndeplorably, the whole order of nature and history.\"\r\n\r\nThese sentences, however, stood in isolation, or else they came too\r\nlate. Immediately after it had been heralded by the literary movement,\r\nafter the archæologists had verbally announced its aim, formulated its\r\nprinciples and laws, German art turned into the new paths. \"It happened\r\nfor the first time in the history of art,\" wrote Goethe, \"that important\r\ntalents took pleasure in disciplining themselves by the past, and so\r\nfounding a new epoch in art.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Des Deutschen Künstler's Vaterland,\r\n   Ist Griechenland, ist Griechenland\"\r\n\r\nwas sung in the academies. And this violent grasping after the ideal of\r\na foreign race brought a bitter revenge, since not one of the artists\r\nwho now appeared had the genius to create anything new out of the old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo Union, Munich._\r\n\r\n  MENGS.   PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF.]\r\n\r\nThe disciples of Winckelmann had not been, like Goethe and Schiller,\r\nvigorous naturalists until the spirit of ancient times had looked upon\r\nthem, and they were consequently still less able to resist her glance.\r\nThey entered upon the new road not with that generative impulse of the\r\ncreative mind, whose superabundance did not know what course it should\r\ntake, what stream it should find. They adopted the forms, as they had\r\nbeen provided by the greater ages, without any doubt as to their\r\nabsolute excellence, or the least attempt at any happy innovation. And\r\nif they \"have better understood\" the Greeks than their predecessors in\r\nItaly and France were able to do, then one is never less like an\r\noriginal nature than when one imitates them faithfully. Winckelmann's\r\nroad to inimitability led not only to a more hollow and lifeless\r\nClassicism than there ever had been, to a more cheerless and unpleasant\r\nart than any which the school of Bologna had produced. It tended, above\r\nall, since the thinking people had thought out the classic idea--which\r\nthe other nations had not--to the sacrifice of all pictorial technique,\r\nof the whole knowledge which the age had up till then possessed. There\r\nis a legend in the history of the Church, that at the time of the\r\ndonation of Constantine a voice was heard from Heaven: \"This day has\r\npoison entered into the body of the Church.\" To the German art of our\r\ncentury this poison was the writings of Winckelmann.\r\n\r\nFirst of all it was _Anton Rafael Mengs_, whose originally strong and\r\ngreat talent was distorted by the counsels of the learned. As in the\r\nworks of the Caracci, those only are to-day of any interest which reveal\r\nthemselves least as eclectics and most as children of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, so with Mengs--he is only enjoyable now where he did not try to\r\nbe antique, but sympathised without too much reflection on the\r\ntraditions of his age. He is particularly so in his fine pastel\r\nportraits in the Dresden Gallery, which are wholly influenced by the\r\ntaste for _rococo_, and are its last expiring manifestation. They are a\r\ntestimony that it was not without some justice that the Apelles of\r\nDresden was called by his contemporaries the most remarkable German\r\npainter of the eighteenth century. Rosalba Carriera and Liotard seem\r\nweak and insipid beside him; Reynolds only at his best had that\r\ncharacteristic clearness, that plastic energy of modelling, and that\r\nlife-like colouring. There is nothing insipid or affected, nothing of\r\nthat simpering affability that his successors brought into vogue. And\r\nwhen we remember that they proceeded from a youth of sixteen, the\r\nstrength and simplicity of intuition seem incredible. In his later\r\nportraits, too, painted in oil, the better ones are directly classic;\r\nvery noble in their clear, subtile, grey tone, strikingly alive, and,\r\nwithal, of an extraordinary independence which shows no leaning upon any\r\nother master whatever. Mengs belongs to those portrait painters who look\r\ninto the souls of their sitters, and he ranks, in works like his\r\nportrait of himself, in the Munich Gallery, amongst the best portrait\r\npainters of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MENGS.   MOUNT PARNASSUS.]\r\n\r\nIn his huge ecclesiastical paintings he is the son of that period which\r\nhad just commenced to be touched by the pallor of thought, and groped\r\neclectically now in this direction and now in that. \"First of all must\r\nthe weeds be rooted up,\" wrote Zanotti in his _Directions to a Young Man\r\nupon Painting_. \"And then we must go back again to Cimabue and Giotto,\r\nand again, a few years later, to Buonarotti and Sanzio, and their noble\r\nsuccessors whose footsteps are no longer sought or followed by any one.\r\nBut when such a happy resurrection will take place, God knows!\" The old\r\nIsmael Mengs believed that that was his concern; he chose Antonio da\r\nAllegri and Rafael Sanzio as sponsors for his son. Anton Rafael should\r\nbecome the eclectic reformer of art, and as he was probably the first\r\npainter who, by the express permission of the Elector of Saxony, was\r\nallowed to visit the hitherto inaccessible Dresden Gallery, this wish\r\nwas easy of accomplishment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANGELICA KAUFFMANN.   _Cassell & Co._]\r\n\r\nHe was quick in freeing himself from the immediate tradition of the age,\r\nand in harmony with the teaching of the Caracci, in returning to the\r\nso-called \"higher\" models of painting. When one runs across such of his\r\npictures in some gallery--notably his altar pieces--they strike one as\r\nthe works of some good master of the seventeenth century whose name one\r\ncannot, for the moment, recollect. His famous \"Holy Night,\" in which he\r\nwished to enter into rivalry with Correggio, has something of a Maratti\r\nabout it, only the heads are more vacant and insipid.\r\n\r\nIt is that unfortunate \"Parnassus\" in the Villa Albani which first marks\r\nthe collapse of this great talent. When, upon the advice of his friend\r\nWinckelmann, he turned from the study of Raphael and Correggio to that\r\nof the antique, Mengs forfeited not only the remnant of all that was\r\nessentially natural, but even all the picturesque qualities which had\r\nhitherto distinguished him. After painting had so long taken sculpture\r\nin tow, now sculpture seemed anxious to be revenged on it, and there was\r\na manifestation of those prettily painted figures in plaster which for\r\nsome score years afterwards paraded in every German picture.\r\n\r\nFor Winckelmann's mistake, as Herder had already pointed out with great\r\njustice, consisted not only in this, that he set up for imitation a\r\ndeparted ideal for the consciousness of his contemporaries, but notably\r\nin that he obtruded principles upon modern painting which might be valid\r\nin ancient sculpture. Since the antique ideal was solely a plastic one,\r\nand neither the Greek Prussian nor, later, Meister Ephraim was clear as\r\nto the difference between sculpture and painting, they practically\r\nrecommended the painter to work after plastic models.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Lessing, in discussing the limits of painting in his\r\n_Laocoön_, took a work of sculpture as his starting-point, proves that\r\nto him the laws and conditions of both arts were valued as the same.\r\nThey denounced the confusion of the art of painting with poetry, and\r\ninstead advocated the confounding of painting with sculpture, which was\r\nno less hazardous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANGELICA KAUFFMANN.   PORTRAIT OF A LADY AS A VESTAL.]\r\n\r\nIn this manner there came an alien element into Mengs' hitherto quite\r\npictorial apprehension; a vain and exclusively reproductive ideality\r\ndeprived his figures of the last remnant of truth to nature which he had\r\nformerly understood how to give them. It is difficult to believe that\r\nWinckelmann's paroxysm of friendship should have burst out, upon the\r\ncompletion of the \"Parnassus,\" into this pæan: \"During the whole of the\r\nnew age a more beautiful work has not appeared in painting; even Raphael\r\nwould have bowed his head.\" The whole is nothing more than a\r\n_mélange_ of plagiarism and _banal_ reminiscences, without soul or\r\nperception, without freshness or individuality; a mere plastic\r\nwarehouse, and not even a painted antique group, but a daubed\r\ncompilation of solitary statues, colder and more lifeless than any\r\nBaltoni ever painted. There was an audacious, strong aim, genial\r\nstrength and an overwhelming flow of fantasy in the contemporary works\r\nof the great _décorateur_ Tiepolo; here there is a mere work of\r\nintellect which with philological aid builds up the composition entirely\r\nof borrowed materials. The only thing which even still points in this\r\nwork to the good old times is a more solid study of form and colour than\r\nall that which originated in Germany during the next fifty years. The\r\nfigures are painted with a strength and bloom which are still quite\r\nworthy of the _rococo_.\r\n\r\nThe \"good _Angelica_\" is the second representative of this phase of\r\ntransition. She, too, at the persuasion of her friend Winckelmann,\r\nclothed herself as an ancient Vestal, but her true woman's nature left\r\nin her classical raiment still a neat fashion of _rococo_. Through her\r\nintercourse with Winckelmann she became somewhat of a \"blue-stocking,\"\r\nand studied the historians of antiquity in order to find there subjects\r\nlike Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi, Agrippina with the urn of\r\nGermanicus, Phryne, and the like. Still more there were the tender\r\nlegends of the ancients, out of whose store she satisfied her patrons:\r\nAdonis at the chase, Psyche, Ariadne abandoned by Theseus or found by\r\nBacchus, the death of Alcestis, Hero and Leander. In these she is soft\r\nto the point of sentimentality, and pleasant to the point of nausea.\r\nGoethe says of her with justice: \"The forms and traits of the figures\r\nhave little variety, the expression of the passions no force, the heroes\r\nlook like gentle boys, or girls in disguise.\" But he also says of her:\r\n\"The lightness, grace in form, colour, conception, and treatment is the\r\none ruling quality of the numerous works of our fair artist. No living\r\npainter has surpassed her either in grace of representation or in the\r\ntaste and capacity with which she handles her brush.\" And this decision,\r\ntoo, can still be endorsed. Angelica knew how to impart to those clear\r\nlines and forms demanded by Winckelmann a grace now coquettish, now\r\nsentimental, but always extremely lovable. She has struck soft\r\nand--notably in her portraits of women--very tender colour chords.\r\n\r\nShe and Mengs were the last who still possessed considerable technical\r\nknowledge. Almost everything which has survived of the tradition of\r\ncraftsmanship in Germany in the nineteenth century is traceable to\r\nMengs' influence, and that fact so offended his successors that they no\r\nlonger counted him as one of them, but put him contemptuously aside as a\r\n\"mannerist painter by recipe.\" \"Such technical knowledge,\" wrote Goethe,\r\n\"hinders that complete abstraction and elevation over the real, which is\r\nasked of identical representations in sculpture, which merely furnish\r\nforms in their highest purity and beauty.\" \"Colouring, light and\r\nshadows, do not give such value to a painting as noble contour alone,\"\r\nwrote Winckelmann, and these sentences became the starting-point of the\r\nnext generation. Winckelmann's error when he recommended the imitation\r\nof Greek sculpture to the modern painter consisted still further in\r\nthis, that he confused \"noble simplicity and quiet grandeur\" with lack\r\nof colour and coldness. Herder had written well: \"In distinction to the\r\ncompact harmony of form in sculpture, painting has her harmonious unity\r\nin colour and light. I do not know why many theorists should have spoken\r\nso contemptuously of what is called _chiaroscuro_, the grouping of light\r\nand shade; it is the instrument of genius with every scholar and master,\r\nthe eye with which he sees, the flashing, spiritual sea with which he\r\nsprinkles everything, and on which, indeed, every outline also depends.\r\nThis divine, spiritual sea of light, this fairyland of adjusted light\r\nand shade, is the business of painting: why should we fight against\r\nnature, and not allow every art to do what it alone can do and do best?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photographic Union, Munich._\r\n\r\n  CARSTENS.   PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF.]\r\n\r\nHis words died away. The philosophic tendency of the century, which\r\nsought to penetrate into the \"soul\" of things, and to recreate things\r\nfrom the throne of the universe of the abstract, tried its hand also\r\nupon painting. By abstracting from the manifestation of colour, and\r\ntouching upon form and line, it came to believe that in these plastic\r\nelements it had discovered the Essential of which it was in search.\r\n\r\nOnce on the road to execute statues in paint, the question ensued, Ought\r\nwe to paint our statues? And as that age, following in Winckelmann's\r\ntrack, understood no word of the significance which the specific,\r\npicturesque principles had for the Greeks, it was only logical that they\r\nshould endeavour to reconcile the idea of immaculate whiteness with that\r\nof classical beauty, to see pure beauty in absence of colour, and in\r\nconsequence to accentuate the question, Ought we to paint our\r\n_pictures_? To painters the most suspicious element in a painting became\r\nthe paint! There is nothing more urgent for them to do than to deprive\r\nthemselves ascetically of all coloristic means of expression. Painting\r\nis shown to be an essential form of corruption--\"The brush is become\r\nthe ruin of our art,\" wrote Cornelius--and there commences the era of a\r\ncartoon style hitherto unprecedented, which is to be carried on by the\r\nmost highly endowed in the most earnest fashion. While during the\r\n_rococo_ the sense of colour had reached, through a piquant arrangement\r\nof the most tender and variegated tones, its highest point of\r\nrefinement, there followed now as a reaction an absolute lack of colour.\r\nThe ideal is seen in an abstract beauty of line, colour as a secondary\r\nmatter and a vain show. It was of as much value as a vari-coloured\r\ndress, which nature could put on or off, without being less nature\r\nthereby. Amongst painters there was talk of nothing but outlines. This\r\nline style, whose world is not the wall or the canvas, but white paper,\r\ncan do with a proportionately meagre study of nature. Why, therefore,\r\nwhen the ideal was so easy of attainment, drudge in the academy, where,\r\nmoreover, since the introduction of Mengs' Classicism, universal\r\ndesolation of the spirit and doctrinaire pedantry reigned? As Mengs had\r\nbroken with the taste of the _rococo_, so the younger generation broke\r\nwith its technique, whilst they left the academy in open\r\ndissatisfaction, and threw off in contempt the whole paraphernalia of\r\ntechnical traditions.\r\n\r\n_Carstens_ plays the momentous rôle in German art as the first who trod\r\nthis path. He has more individuality than Mengs; _antiquarianising_ with\r\nhim is not exclusively an external derivation and a cold imitation: he\r\nlives in the antique; the world of the Greek poets is his spiritual\r\nhome, and their profound thoughts find in him a subtle interpreter. But\r\nhe has, at the same time, the melancholy fame of being the first of the\r\nfrivolous to renounce the national inheritance, the knowledge bequeathed\r\nby the _rococo_ age, and so definitely to cut the chain which should\r\notherwise have connected German art of the nineteenth century with that\r\nof the eighteenth.\r\n\r\nThrough the _Investigations of Beauty in Painting_, by Daniel Webb,\r\nwhich was founded on Winckelmann's _Thoughts on Imitation_, the seed of\r\nHellenism was already sown in the youth's soul. He heard talk of the\r\ndwarf intelligences of the age; how the studios of inferior artists were\r\nfull of gaping visitors, whilst the halls of the Vatican stood deserted.\r\n\"Learn the taste for beauty in the antique,\" the cooper's apprentice\r\nlearns from Webb's works. \"Let us meditate upon the style of the\r\npainter's art in the 'Laocoön,' with regard to the fighter. Notice the\r\nsublimity in the divine character of Apollo. Let us stand hushed before\r\nthe exquisite beauty of the Venus di Medici. These are the extreme\r\nincentives of the art of drawing.... The Belvedere Apollo and the\r\ndaughter of Niobe offer us an ideal of nobility and beauty. Raphael's\r\ndrawing never reached to such a height of perfection as we find in the\r\nstatues of the Greeks.... Whither do you carry me, gods and demigods and\r\nheroes who live in marble? I follow your call, and, Imagination! thy\r\neternal laws. I go into the Villa Medici and breathe there the purest\r\nair. I stretch myself on a flowery plot, the shadow of the orange trees\r\ncovers me;--there, unmolested, I gaze at a group full of the highest\r\nfeminine beauty. Niobe, my beloved, beautiful mother of beautiful\r\nchildren, thou fairest among women, how I love thee!\" So dreamed Asmus\r\nJacob in the wine-cellar at Eckernförde, or in his solitary chamber by\r\nthe dim light of his lamp, as he had been seized with giddiness before\r\nall the great and marvellous revelations of art which this book had\r\nafforded him. In his enraptured fantasy he painted the hour nearer and\r\nnearer when he should attain to a sight of the works which were\r\ndescribed. Could he have looked into the future, what a picture would\r\nhave come before his eyes! Would he have recognised himself in the\r\nbroken-down man, with the pale countenance, the grief-marked expression,\r\nand the decrepit figure, who in Rome gazed spellbound at the Colossus of\r\nMonte Cavallo?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARSTENS.   SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS.]\r\n\r\nOur Holsteiner was two-and-twenty years old when he discarded the\r\ncooper's apron and entered the Copenhagen Academy, being then too old\r\nfor any regular training. His head was so full of \"inventions\" that \"it\r\ncould not enter his mind to begin from the beginning.\" \"Drawing from the\r\nlife did not satisfy me; the fellow, too, who sat as my model, although\r\nhe was for the rest well built, seemed to me, in contrast with the\r\nantique from which I had attained a higher ideal of beauty, so petty and\r\nimperfect that I thought I could easily learn to draw a better figure if\r\nI only confined myself to that. I resolved not to visit the academy, in\r\nspite of the other artists impressing upon me the importance and\r\nutility of academic study.\" He stayed daily, instead, for hours together\r\nbefore the casts in the antique room, and \"a holy feeling of adoration,\r\nalmost compelling me to tears, pervaded me. There I never drew at all\r\nafter an antique. When I attempted it, it was as though all my emotion\r\nwas chilled by it. I thought that I should learn more if I gazed at them\r\nwith great studiousness.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARSTENS.   ARGO LEAVING THE TRITON'S MERE.]\r\n\r\nThus he reached, as Fernow says, the method whereby he \"did not tread\r\nthe ordinary way of imitation, gradually progressing to a special\r\ninvention, but began at once with invention.\" There he was the true\r\nchild of his age. At a period whose creative power found its highest\r\nexpression in philosophy and poetry, the painter strove for the\r\nreputation only of being the _poet_ of his pictures. And Carstens\r\nencountered the old tragedians and philosophic writers with a fine,\r\npoetic understanding. \"The Greek Heroes with Cheiron,\" \"Helen at the\r\nSkæan Gate,\" \"Ajax,\" \"Phoenix and Odysseus in the Tent of Achilles,\"\r\n\"Priam and Achilles,\" \"The Fates,\" \"Night with her Children,\" \"Sleep and\r\nDeath,\" \"The passage of Megapenthes,\" \"Homer before the People,\" \"The\r\nGolden Age\"--all these prints have really something of the noble\r\nsimplicity and quiet harmony of Greek art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARSTENS.   CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT.]\r\n\r\nIt can be understood, then, that such subjects should be in the highest\r\ndegree interesting to an archæologist. When Carstens, in April 1795, was\r\norganising the famous exhibition of his collected works in Rome, Fernow\r\npublished in Wieland's _Deutscher Merkur_ a discourse in which he\r\ncelebrated him as the creator of a new epoch. From the very first,\r\nhowever, an equally resolute opposition was excited in artistic circles.\r\nThe painter Müller, nicknamed \"The Devil's Miller,\" who at that time\r\nwandered about Rome as a cicerone, proves that Winckelmann's principles,\r\neven at the threshold of the century, by no means met with universal\r\nacceptance. The _Writing of Herr Müller, Painter in Rome, upon the\r\nExhibition of Herr Professor Carstens_, with the motto _Amicus Plato,\r\nAmicus Socrates, magis amica veritas_, was published in 1797 in\r\nSchiller's _Horæ_. Carstens imitated; he worked rather by reminiscence\r\nand understanding than by fantasy. Isolated figures do not bring their\r\nindividuality to an expression. Then he pointed out the models,\r\ndiscussed the lack of colour, and proved numerous sins of the\r\ndraughtsman against nature in detail. The artist must ever seek to find\r\ncharacteristic expression; composition comes in the second degree.\r\nTechnique, even if the previous age has been an epoch of fabrication,\r\nmust always stand in the foreground; it is not only from the artist, but\r\nfrom the connoisseur, that knowledge is demanded, and in consequence of\r\nthis exhibition Carstens is recommended to forbear from his fantastical\r\ngeniality, observe nature, and achieve a picture exactly, since it is\r\nonly from nature that the ideal springs, and consequently nothing can\r\nbe great and beautiful in the representation which is not right and\r\ntrue. In almost similar words, later on, Koch, in his _Thoughts on\r\nPainting_, and with him the majority of artists, has censured Carstens.\r\nAnd posterity cannot but allow them to be in the right as against the\r\narchæologists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARSTENS.   PRIAM AND ACHILLES.]\r\n\r\nAdmirable in Carstens is the zeal with which he defended his ideal, the\r\nsacred fire which burned within him and sustained him, even during those\r\nyears when his sickly frame was weakened by consumption. Art was, as he\r\nwrote, his element, his religion, his beatitude, his existence. And it\r\nis already something great to wear oneself out alone for the sake of an\r\nideal. Carstens was a sublime dreamer. It will not be forgotten of him\r\nthat, in an age when abundant mediocrity and manufacture were\r\nall-prevailing, he once more pointed, unfaltering in his noble and pure\r\nintention, to the sublimity of artistic creation. The history of art,\r\nhowever, has not to deal with hearts, but to judge logically by results;\r\nand it would not be doing justice to the old masters, nor to those\r\nearnest _rococo_ painters who sat at their easels with less noble\r\nintentions, but with so much greater knowledge of their craft, if one\r\nwere to proclaim Carstens, in consideration of the self-sacrifice and\r\nrenunciation which he showed in the fight for his ideal, as a martyr and\r\na genius, a pioneer of German art. He was not a genius, as he thought\r\nhimself, and announced so proudly to Heinitz, the Minister; for that he\r\npossessed too little originality. It is not imagination, but\r\nreminiscence, which created his works. The outlines of his plates are\r\ndone with fine sentiment, but sentiment taken from the Greeks, and he\r\nrequired no genius to recognise in his recollection and his hand a\r\ntranscript of Greek forms. What pleases us in Carstens is in substance\r\nnot Carstens, but an echo of what we like in the Greek statues and\r\nvases, in Michael Angelo and other old masters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENELLI.   THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.]\r\n\r\nHe was not a martyr, because in his struggles he met with assistance and\r\nencouragement such as were granted to no old master, and if, in spite of\r\nthat, he never rose above the cares of life, that is only a proof of the\r\nlimitations and partiality of his art. He had lost all decorative\r\nfacility; still more was the inheritance of oil painting first naturally\r\nmislaid by him, and by draughtsmanship alone not even Dürer nor\r\nRembrandt could have lived.\r\n\r\nThis deficiency in technique must even debar him from claiming any\r\nhigher signification than that of a clever dilettante. He is not an\r\nartist who does not in the midst of his exaltation think to put himself\r\nin possession of the means which can turn the lispings of genius into a\r\nfully intelligible language. Carstens' plates seduce by a certain wavy\r\ntreatment of the lines, but no one of them can sustain critical\r\nappreciation. It is inconsistent to work in the beautiful and not to\r\nbecome free of ugliness, to move in the great, in the sublime, and at\r\nthe same time to fall from one defect of form to another, from coarse\r\nuncouthness into the most elementary sins against drawing and\r\nproportion. Carstens was a draughtsman who could not draw, and, with\r\nthis limitation of his genius, by no manner of means a founder of German\r\nart. One cannot call him a mannerist, because with him art and\r\nindividuality corresponded; but, nevertheless, like Mengs and Lairesse,\r\nhe gave art at second-hand, and only differs from them in that with him\r\ncommences that complete abandonment of the idea of colour which after\r\nhim disfigured German art. For the future it was quite indifferent that\r\nThorwaldsen took suggestions from Carstens, and Genelli trod in his\r\nfootprints as a draughtsman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENELLI.   THETIS LAMENTING THE FATE OF HECTOR.]\r\n\r\n_Bonaventura Genelli_, if one takes for once the standpoint of the\r\npainters of his time, who desired to be the \"poets\" of their works, is\r\ncertainly a not unremarkable poet. In him, who was born in the year of\r\nCarstens' death, the spirit of the little Holsteiner was raised to life,\r\nand the figure which he assumed in this new incarnation actually made an\r\nimpression like a picture out of beauty-illuminated days of Hellas. The\r\nmuscular, thick-set figure of a youthful Hercules, with a broad chest\r\nand sturdy neck, a head of short brown curly hair, full lips fringed by\r\nthe compact beard of a Sophocles, the short Greek nose, grave eyes\r\nglancing out from beneath the strong brows--such was Genelli, a Hellene\r\nleft stranded in Germany, the last Centaur, as Heyse has depicted him in\r\nhis novel--\"an antediluvian, mythological enigma on four sound legs\r\nsprung upon our godless world.\" Thus he sat, as he himself writes, in\r\nRome, \"in his dirty chamber, bare except for a chair or two, rickety or\r\nquite broken down, and on the wall a pair of hawks nailed up, whose\r\npinions served as models for his winged figures.\" Thus he sat later in\r\nhis little house in the _Sendlingergasse_ at Munich, and lived in his\r\nworld of imagination. Perhaps, had he been the child of a more fortunate\r\nperiod in art, he might have become a strong and memorable painter; as a\r\nsuccessor of Carstens he has left behind him a legacy of two suites of\r\ncopper prints--the two tragedies of the \"Profligate\" and the \"Witch.\" He\r\nexisted, moreover, only in contour; he never rose above harmoniously\r\noutlined silhouette. It was only to this point that his talent would\r\nsustain him. The more he wished to produce shadow, water-colour, or even\r\noil, the more tedious and pale and vague did he become. And even in his\r\ndrawing he shares with Carstens the desolate generalisation of form, the\r\neternal euphony which so soon becomes wearisome and monotonous. To\r\nbeauty of line everything is offered up. The blank characterlessness of\r\nthe faces is even more noticeable with him than with Carstens, who had,\r\nafter all, in his youth drawn excellent portraits in crayons, and on\r\nthis account was able to give even to his Greeks more individual traits\r\nand a certain variety of expression. With Genelli the heads are treated\r\nas no more than parts of the body, and as they gave no opportunity for\r\nflowing lines, they have not even the same graciousness as the limbs.\r\nHis women fared worst, for whilst he could be his own model for his men,\r\nhe created the _ewig Weibliche_ out of his inner consciousness. In men\r\nand women the eyes, in particular, are merely animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENELLI.   ODYSSEUS AND THE SIRENS.]\r\n\r\nCarstens' influence on German art has been then entirely a negative one.\r\nIt was not on such a foundation that a German art could arise. He\r\nprepared no ground for his successors on which they could build further;\r\nbut through his abandonment of the whole capital which, since Stephen\r\nLochner, had been handed down at compound interest from one generation\r\nof painters to another, he rather cut away the ground from under their\r\nfeet. \"For very easily can art go astray, but it is a difficult and\r\nlengthy process for her to recover herself.\"\r\n\r\nThe art which was born in that humble studio in Rome to the sickly,\r\nneurotic man, the \"famous draughtsman,\" needed later, in order to become\r\ntechnically healthy again, an impulse replete with life from abroad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  BONAVENTURA GENELLI.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE CLASSICAL REACTION IN FRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn France also modern art began with a stream of antiquarianism which\r\nflowed from the same archæological source. De Brosses published a\r\nhistory of the Roman Republic, and wrote on Herculaneum. Leroy produced\r\nhis _Ruines des plus anciens monuments de la Grèce_ in 1758. Shortly\r\nafterwards the _Recueils d'Antiquité_ of Caylus and Hamilton were\r\npublished. The former undertook his great journeys, and presented the\r\nAcademy of Inscriptions with a succession of archæological treatises. He\r\nis perhaps the first since Batteux and Coypel who again makes of the\r\nmodern painter a positive demand for a quiet beauty of lines after the\r\n\"_manière simple et noble du bel antique_.\" The architects begin to take\r\ncounsel of Vitruvius, and to work after some model borrowed from the\r\nantique. Soufflot rebuilt the Pantheon, and produced the Temple of\r\nPæstum.\r\n\r\nEven in 1763 Grimm could write: \"For some years past we have been making\r\nkeen inquiry for antique ornaments and forms. The predilection for them\r\nhas become so universal that now everything is to be done _à la\r\nGrecque_. The interior and exterior decorations of houses, furniture,\r\ndress material, and goldsmiths' work all bear alike the stamp of the\r\nGreeks. The fashion passes from architecture to millinery: our ladies\r\nhave their hair dressed _à la Grecque_, our fine gentlemen would think\r\nthemselves dishonoured if they did not hold in their hands _une boîte à\r\nla Grecque_.\" Even Diderot's preference for the ethical and emotional,\r\nas Greuze had painted it--and as Diderot himself had dramatised\r\nit--veered round at the commencement of the sixties into an enthusiasm\r\nfor the antique. After 1761 he carried on in the salons a war of\r\nextermination against poor old Boucher, and lectured him in a menacing\r\nvoice upon the \"great and severe taste of antiquity.\" He twitted him\r\nwith possessing neither reality nor taste, and produced in proof the\r\nfact that, in the whole catalogue of Boucher's figures, not four could\r\nbe found which could be employed in relief, or even as statues. The new\r\ntaste demanded pure and simple lines, the beauty of sculpture; it went\r\nback to the antique. When a French translation of Winckelmann appeared\r\nin 1765 he spoke out, on the occasion of a review of the book, clearly\r\nand plainly: \"_Il me semble qu'il faudrait étudier l'antique pour\r\napprendre à voir la nature_.\" In the same vein Watelet pronounced on\r\nBoucher: \"_Jamais artiste n'a plus ouvertement témoigné son mépris pour\r\nla vraie beauté telle qu'elle a été sentie et exprimée par les\r\nstatuaires_ _de l'ancienne Grèce_.\" Thus the change in the artistic\r\noutlook was heralded long before the curtain went up upon the events of\r\n1789.\r\n\r\n_Madame Vigée-Lebrun_, the French Angelica Kauffmann, possessed of a\r\ntender, soft, sympathetic talent, is perhaps the truest representative\r\nof this gracious, entirely French transition style, over which like a\r\nbreath, but only like a breath, hovers the antique. She has in her\r\nportraits, in an especially refined manner, fixed that age when noble\r\nladies desired to forget the Marquise and Duchess, to exhibit only the\r\nwife and mother, and believed that by unconstraint of attitude in their\r\nsimple white robe, the scarf thrown modestly over the shoulders, they\r\nhad effected a return to antique simplicity. Boucher, moved to the\r\ndepths of his consciousness by Diderot, resolved to paint a picture\r\ntaken from ancient history. Greuze painted \"Severus and Caracalla,\"\r\nFragonard \"Choereas and Callirhöe.\" Hubert Robert grew more and more\r\narchæological, and played in his landscapes with ancient remains and\r\nclassical ruins. Vien became enthusiastic over antique gems, and thought\r\nhe must draw the conclusion, from the noble calm of these figures, that\r\nthe amiable coquetry and capricious garments of _rococo_ were without\r\nnobility. His plan was \"to study the antique--Raphael, the Caracci,\r\nDomenichino, Michael Angelo, and, in one word, all those masters whose\r\nworks convey the character of truth and grandeur.\"\r\n\r\nBut what gave far other significance to the French classicism of the\r\nensuing period was that great event in the world's history, of which\r\nFrance became the theatre at the close of the eighteenth century. In the\r\nsecluded gardens of Versailles, where the goat-footed Pan embraced the\r\ntall, white nymphs by an artificial water-fall, the noble lords and\r\nladies, clad as Pierrots and Columbines, overheard in the midst of their\r\nwhispered flirtations the menacing earthquake which was announced in\r\nthunder from Paris. Soon they beheld the earth crack and burst asunder,\r\nas that time came when the air was filled with the smoke of powder, when\r\nthe first notes of the Marseillaise rang out, and in the Place de la\r\nConcorde, where to-day the loveliest fountains in the world are playing,\r\nblood ran from a dozen guillotines. That \"_après nous le deluge_\" of the\r\nMarquise de Pompadour had become a dire, prophetic truth, and in that\r\nflood of blood and horrors the artistic ideal of the eighteenth century\r\nwas also washed away. The Revolution gave the death-blow to _rococo_. At\r\none stroke it overthrew the most pleasant of all French periods, the\r\ntruest presentiment of French grace and _esprit_, the noble and amiable\r\nart of Louis XV, which the melancholy, life-emitting Watteau, Boucher,\r\nand Fragonard cause to hover before us as in the clouds of a dream.\r\nClassicism, however, attained through it a new and stronger basis, a\r\ncertain connection with modern life, since it was transposed by it from\r\nthe Museum of Antiquity into the middle of the Place de la Concorde\r\nbeneath the guillotine.\r\n\r\nWhat the age of the Revolution demanded of art was at all events not a\r\n\"noble style,\" as Vien had required of it, but rather in the first place\r\na Spartan virtue. Various philosophical writers had drawn a parallel\r\nbetween the organisation of the old and the modern state; they had\r\nexerted themselves to show that the old Republics were models of an\r\nalmost absolute perfection, which the modern should, in so far as it was\r\npossible, imitate. They had contrasted the moral conditions of Sparta\r\nand the Roman Republic with the moral constitution of contemporary,\r\nmonarchical France. They had quoted on every opportunity the acts of\r\nvirtue, renunciation, courage, and patriotic sacrifice of the great men\r\nof antiquity; they had used these deeds as a means of proving their\r\nthesis, and their ideas aroused deep echoes in men's hearts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELISABETH VIGÉE-LEBRUN.   PORTRAIT OF THE PAINTER WITH\r\n  HER DAUGHTER.]\r\n\r\nThe sentiment of Rome had entered into the people as a thing of flesh\r\nand blood even before the catastrophe had ensued. \"We were more\r\nprepared,\" wrote Nodier, \"for the particular tone of the language of the\r\nRevolution than people would have believed, and it cost us little pains\r\nto pass from the studies of our _gymnases_ to the strife of the forum.\r\nIn the schools we had prize compositions set of this kind: Who stands\r\nhigher, the elder Brutus who judged his children, or the younger Brutus\r\nwho judged his father? And so Livy and Tacitus have done more to\r\noverthrow the monarchical system than Voltaire and Rousseau.\" It was\r\nevident then that France, so soon as she had freed herself from her\r\nkings, so soon as she had spoken the word \"Republic,\" must take the\r\n_Roman_ Republic as her pattern. People lived in an atmosphere of\r\nantiquity; the great citizens of Rome and Athens were ranged with the\r\nFrench National Convention; Scævola, Scipio, Cato, Cincinnatus, were the\r\nidols of the populace. The speakers in the council cited the ancients in\r\npreference; Madame Vigée-Lebrun gave _soupers à la Grecque_. \"Everything\r\nwas ordered according to the _Voyage d'Anacharsis_--garments, viands,\r\namusements, and the table, all were Athenian. Madame Lebrun herself was\r\nAspasia; M. l'Abbé Barthélémy, in a Greek dress with a laurel wreath on\r\nhis head, recited a poem; M. de Cabierès played the golden lyre as\r\nMemnon, and young boys waited at table as slaves. The table itself was\r\nset entirely with Greek utensils, and all the viands were actually those\r\nof ancient Greece.\" Children were given Greek and Roman names. People\r\ncalled themselves \"Romans.\" \"_Mais, je l'aimais, Romains!_\" cried Coulon\r\nat the death of Mirabeau. Paris is Rome. In the theatre the bust of\r\nBrutus is set opposite that of Voltaire, and the actor says: \"_O buste\r\nréveré de Brutus, d'un grand homme, transporté dans Paris tu n'as point\r\nquitté Rome_.\" And as with the bust of Brutus in the theatre, that of\r\nMucius Scævola appears in the cafés, which Parisian journalists, still\r\nfull of remembrances of ancient history studied in the gymnasium, liken\r\nto the Lyceum and the Porch. In every case ancient Rome is set up as the\r\nexemplar. The Parisian collection of engravings on copper possesses a\r\nreproduction of the guillotine, with the inscription: _A similar machine\r\nwas used for the execution of the Roman, Titus Manlius_. A valet\r\ncommitted suicide, and quoted the illustrious example of Seneca. Had it\r\nbeen possible, people would have gladly thrown themselves back eighteen\r\nhundred years into the past, with all its grandeur, its simplicity, and\r\nits ruthlessness. Political and social forms did not suffice; even the\r\nimplements and costume of the ancients were again brought into honour.\r\nFurniture put on antiquarian shapes; the walls were decorated _à la\r\nGrecque_. The lively frivolity of _rococo_, with its freaks and fancies,\r\nwas no longer adapted to the boudoir of the age of revolution, now\r\ntransformed into the political council-room. Twists and curves were no\r\nlonger permitted: everything had to be straightforward, logical,\r\nungenerous, inexorable. Men went clad wretchedly, with red Phrygian caps\r\nand no breeches. Women and girls cast aside their ordinary attire and\r\nput on straight, falling drapery, discarded their heeled shoes and bound\r\nsandals round their feet, shook the powder from their locks and tied\r\ntheir hair in a Greek knot. \"Dressed in white raiment without adornment,\r\nbut decked in the virtue of simplicity,\" they appeared in the cabinet of\r\nthe president, in order to surrender their jewels for the salvation of\r\ntheir country, like those Roman matrons in the time of Camillus.\r\n\r\nAnd, in co-operation with the building up of this new world, painting\r\nalso advanced. It was only when it assisted to arouse civic virtue, it\r\nwas said at a sitting of the jury at the Salon of 1793, that painting\r\ncould possess a right to exist in the new state, and as the handmaid of\r\nthis patriotism might fulfil an even higher mission than it had done in\r\nancient Greece and Rome. \"The Greeks and Romans were indeed only slaves,\r\nbut we French are by nature free, philosophers in character, virtuous in\r\nour every perception, and artists through our taste.\" In proportion as\r\nthe French Republic transcended the old free states, so too must French\r\nart take the lead of the antique. \"All that stimulated art in Greece,\r\nthe gymnastic exercises, the public games, the national festivals, is\r\nalso accessible to the French, who possess above all that which the\r\nGreeks lacked, the feeling for true liberty. To depict the history of a\r\nfree people is indeed quite another mission for the true genius than to\r\nembody scenes out of mythology.\"\r\n\r\nThrough this fresh _nuance_, which classicism thus acquired, the ground\r\nwas cut from under the feet of those who devoted themselves to the study\r\nof the antique as conceived by Diderot. The new moral age would have no\r\ntraffic with those artists in whom the last smile of the eighteenth\r\ncentury was personified. Their pictures, full of grace and caprice, fell\r\ninto the same disrepute into which everything of yesterday had come, and\r\nit was only with a bitter smile that they followed the course of events.\r\nThe younger Moreau, that animated master of _rococo_, became\r\nacademically cold and tedious when he designed his book on the French\r\ncostume of the Revolution. The good Fragonard, who was only fifty-nine\r\nin 1789, and lived till 1806, saw himself hooted in spite of his\r\n\"Choereas.\" He, the true representative of frivolous tenderness, of fair\r\nand roseate hues, had lost every right to exist in the new world, and\r\nended his life by a sad death when, after the Reign of Terror, there was\r\nno longer a place for _fêtes galantes_. A delightful portrait of\r\nhimself, which he painted in the first period of the Revolution, shows\r\nus an old man, clothed entirely in black, softly melancholy, standing in\r\na formal, dusky-brown salon. On the table on which his arm rests lies a\r\nguitar, at his feet a portfolio of engravings; but he neither plays the\r\nguitar nor looks at the prints. In the shadows of the falling evening\r\nhe reminds himself forlornly of past days, and his bald forehead, where\r\nso many rose-coloured dreams have passed, is overcast with gloomy\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\nGreuze, too, outlived himself. It was no use for him to pretend more and\r\nmore to the utmost virtue, and to paint an \"Ariadne at Naxos.\" He died\r\nin misery and oblivion in 1805. The demands which this new classicism\r\nmade were able to be satisfied by no one any longer, not even by Vien.\r\nHowever loudly he might proclaim himself a student of the Greeks, he,\r\nnevertheless, remained a very timid and lukewarm revolutionary. An old\r\nman, cold and peaceful and stolid, moderate in everything, he had\r\nneither the energy nor the audacity of the reformer. He had been the\r\nCourt painter of Louis XVI, a most monarchically disposed and loyal man,\r\nand was a suspect on this ground alone to those who were in power in\r\n1789. His pictures, too, describe no more than the end of a world.\r\nGreuze, Fragonard, and Vien, in spite of their assumed seriousness,\r\nsurvived only as gallant phantoms in the new age, by the side of those\r\nmen of more rugged countenance who inaugurated the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JACQUES LOUIS DAVID.   _L'Art._]\r\n\r\n_Jacques Louis David_ first satisfied the new requirements, and in so\r\ndoing lent to French classicism, if only for a few years, a certain\r\ntouch of far greater vivacity. He it was who carried through, in all its\r\nconsequence, that reformation in taste which Vien had sought in\r\nexternals, in costume, furniture and decoration; who inspired the gems\r\npainted by Vien with republican pathos, and became in this way the great\r\nherald of that age which read Plutarch and made Paris into a modern\r\nSparta. David, _Prix de Rome_ after three successive failures, still\r\ncame from that \"corrupt epoch\" against which Republican prudery was so\r\nexcited. At the age of twenty-six he had already painted Soffits, in the\r\nmanner of his kinsman \"Boucher, to say it with respect.\" But the journey\r\nto Rome converted Saul into Paul. In 1775 Vien, on his appointment as\r\ndirector of the Roman Academy, had taken him to Italy as his best pupil,\r\nand hardly dreamt at that time that this young man would strike out on\r\nsuch an entirely new path from his Roman studies. He did not wait for\r\nthe Revolution to be converted; when the hour struck he was ready. Thus\r\nhis first pictures were in a manner the prelude to the Revolution. In\r\nthem he had already quite consciously entered upon the road along which\r\nhe was to go later. His \"Oath of the Horatii\" and his \"Brutus,\" both\r\npainted in Rome in 1784, proclaimed his programme. The little, rosy\r\nloves, the doves of Venus, and all the charming frivolity and gallantry\r\nof _rococo_, received their final dismissal, and rough men walked in\r\ntheir stead. He broke his staff over all that he had previously\r\nvenerated, and declared loudly that he had sinned when in his youth he\r\nhad believed in the flowery palette of _rococo_, and completed in tender\r\ntones those ceiling frescoes which Fragonard had commenced in the house\r\nof Mdlle. Guimard. Capricious frivolities had to make way for a manlier\r\nart, matter \"that was worthy to rivet the gaze of a free nation upon\r\nitself.\" Already, long before the taking of the Bastille, the painting\r\nof young David was valued by the rising generation as the artistic\r\nembodiment of their political ideas, imbibed while they were still at\r\nschool. When the \"Horatii\" was completed it was not only old Pompeo\r\nBattoni who exclaimed, when he saw the picture in David's Roman studio,\r\n\"_Tu ed io soli siamo pittori, pel rimanente si puo gettarlo nel\r\nfiume._\" In Paris his success was universal; all the critics were\r\nunanimous in praise; David was the man after the heart of the age, for\r\nhis picture was the first which spoke clearly and perceptibly of the\r\npathos of the revolution which stood at the threshold. People saw in it\r\nan \"example of patriotism which knew no obstacles,\" since not even love\r\nfor their sister, who was betrothed to the enemy, prevailed upon the\r\nHoratii to refrain from combat with the Curiati. His next picture,\r\n\"Brutus\" as he received the lictors, when they bring him the bodies of\r\nhis sons who have been implicated in a monarchical conspiracy, was\r\ngreeted as allegorical of the incorruptible justice of republicanism.\r\nThe populace saw in it the \"glorification of the chastisement of all\r\ntraitors to liberty,\" and acclaimed David because he \"had founded the\r\nsinewy style which should characterise the heroic deeds of the\r\nrevolutionaries, children of liberty, equality, and fraternity.\" And one\r\nunderstands--when one also adds the influence of Napoleon--this reaction\r\nof military simplicity against the effeminacy of _rococo_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DAVID.   MADAME RÉCAMIER.]\r\n\r\nDavid, at the outbreak of the Revolution, no longer a young man, but\r\nforty years old, was the terrible painter of the age, its despotic\r\ndictator. As a deputy in the Convention he not only ruled over painting,\r\nbut also imposed his taste upon sculpture, ivory work, goldsmiths' work,\r\nand decoration. He designed the new costumes for the deputies and\r\nministers. As organiser of public fêtes, he brought to life again the\r\nwhole of republican Rome. He was one of those rare artists who are the\r\nmen of their hour. To a new plebeian race, to whose feverishly excited\r\npatriotism the soft, luxurious, aristocratically reprehensible art of\r\n_rococo_ must seem as a mockery of all the rights of men, he showed, for\r\nthe first time, the man, the hero who died for an idea or for his\r\ncountry; and he gave this man huge and elastic muscles, like those of a\r\ngladiator who struggles in the arena. He was a second Hercules,\r\ncleansing the Augæan stables; with his own strong shoulders he thrust\r\nback the petulant band of painters who had tarried too long in the\r\nisland of Cythera. He applied art to the heroism of the day, gave it the\r\nmartial attitude of patriotism, inspired it with the spirit of\r\nRobespierre, St. Just, and Danton. The more obtrusively his heroes\r\nparaded their patriotism, the more people saw in them a picture of the\r\nFrench nation, as true as a transposition could hope to be. This\r\nstrained rhetorical pathos dwelt in the mind of the age. Talma moved the\r\npeople to enthusiasm when he played the \"Horatii\" of Corneille in the\r\nclassic cothurnus. When David painted, the state declamations of the\r\norators still rang in his ears. Robespierre is said to have spoken from\r\nthe tribune slowly, rhythmically, artistically: a Bossuet in his\r\nrostrum, a Boileau in his chair, while the volcano quivered beneath his\r\nvery feet: his philippics were carefully divided into three sections,\r\nlike academic discourses: his patriotism resolved itself into tirades\r\nwith correctly composed periods. In David's pictures we have an exact\r\ncorrespondence with all this: the rigid classicality of his composition,\r\nfigures grouped as though on parade; his cold pathos, the counterpart to\r\nthat of the orators' fine sentiments set forth in fine phrases.\r\n\r\nThe great distinction between the beginning of modern art in Germany and\r\nin France is that in France the new style was not only called forth by\r\nthe influence of a scientific programme from outside, but stood in\r\nconjunction with a great transformation in culture, and that it was\r\ncompelled at first to concern itself not only with imitation and\r\nphilological retrospect, but with the free expression of the\r\ncharacteristically modern spirit. German art had no new pronouncement to\r\nmake through the medium of the antique; it followed, on the other hand,\r\nthe programme of an artistically barren scholar who forgot that\r\narchæology is not art, recommended imitation as the path to perfection,\r\nand perpetually reminded the artists who followed him how widely they\r\ndeviated from the correct lines of the model. \"Afterwards they rebuke\r\nit, and say it is not antique and consequently not good art,\" as\r\nAlbrecht Dürer had complained of such people. In the earnest sentiment,\r\nthe exalted Roman spirit, the declaiming over rugged, masculine virtues,\r\nfreedom and patriotism, that found expression in David's first pictures,\r\nthere lived something of the Catonian spirit of the Terror; and that\r\nstill gives them historical value. His enthusiasm was not, first and\r\nforemost, for antique art, but for the ideas of country, duty, freedom,\r\nprogress. The words antiquity and democracy were of like meaning to him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DAVID.   THE OATH OF THE HORATII.]\r\n\r\nAnd how thoroughly this man was permeated with the spirit of his age is\r\nshown still more when he discarded the cothurnus, boldly attacked the\r\npresent, and gave himself up entirely to the delineation of what came\r\nunder his direct observation in his own life and experience. There he\r\nbecame not only a rhetorician, a revolutionary agitator, but a really\r\ngreat painter. Lepelletier on his death-bed, the assassinated Marat,\r\nand the dead Barre, are works of a mighty _naturalist_. Lepelletier, one\r\nof the many deputies who had voted for the death of Louis XVI, was\r\ntreacherously assassinated in Paris, on 20th January 1793, by a valet of\r\nthe king's. The body was publicly exhibited; David painted it, and on\r\n29th March presented the picture to the Convention. As the portrait of\r\nthe \"first Martyr of Liberty,\" it was hung in the Convention chamber. On\r\n13th July 1793 Marat, the man-of-terror, fell a victim to the knife of\r\nCharlotte Corday. David was presiding at the Jacobin Club when the news\r\nwas brought him, and he embraced the citizen who had arrested the girl.\r\nDeputations of the people appeared in the Convention to express their\r\ngrief for the heavy loss. Suddenly a voice was heard to cry: \"_Où es tu,\r\nDavid? Tu as transmis à la posterité l'image de Lepelletier mourant pour\r\nla patrie, il te reste encore un tableau à faire._\" Silence succeeded in\r\nthe Assembly. Then David started up: \"_Je le ferai._\" On 11th October he\r\ninformed the Convention that his \"Marat\" was finished. \"The people asked\r\nfor their murdered man back again, longed to look once more on the\r\nfeatures of their truest friend. They cried to me: 'David, take up your\r\nbrush, avenge Marat, so that the enemy may blanch when they perceive the\r\ndistorted countenance of the man who became the victim of his love for\r\nfreedom.' I heard the voice of the people, and obeyed.\" Thus David spoke\r\nin the Assembly when he presented the Republic with the picture of the\r\nmurdered man--one of the most thrilling representations of that awful\r\nage. The body is lying in the bath. Only the naked upper part of the\r\nbody, and the head, with a dirty cloth tied round it, and fallen back\r\nupon the right shoulder, are visible; one hand, resting back on the side\r\nof the bath, still holds a paper in a convulsive grip; the other hangs\r\ndown limp and dead to the ground. Over this head, with the half-closed\r\neyelids, and the mouth distorted from the death-throes, Caravaggio would\r\nhave rejoiced, there is such keen naturalism in every stroke of the\r\nbrush. Like Géricault, in later times, David was then a regular visitor\r\nat the Morgue, attended at executions, and took an interest in the\r\nconvulsive muscular movements of the guillotined. And the colour, too,\r\nlike the drawing, is of a naturalistic strength to which he never again\r\nattained. The light falls slantingly on the corpse from above and throws\r\nthe head, shoulder, and one arm into strong relief, while all the rest\r\nis left in obscurity. In this awful _still-life_ of uncompromising\r\nreality and tragical grandeur he has created a work in the midst of an\r\nage of storm which will survive all storms and all changes of taste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  DAVID.   THE RAPE OF THE SABINES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DAVID.   HELEN AND PARIS.]\r\n\r\nHis portraits have no less strikingly survived the fiery ordeal of time.\r\nIn them, too, he is neither rhetorical nor cold, but full of fire and\r\nthe freshness of youth. Face to face with his model, he forgot the\r\nGreeks and Romans, saw life alone, was rejuvenated in the youth-giving\r\nfount of nature, and painted--almost alone of the painters of his\r\ngeneration--the truth. Here his effect, when otherwise he was lacking in\r\nall naïveté, is actually naïve and intimate. The best painters have\r\nnever treated flesh better. He had an aversion to palette tones, and\r\nsought after nature with unexampled attention. The fine pearl-grey of\r\nhis colouring is as delicate as it is distinguished; in his portraits,\r\nespecially, the relief-tones of blue and light rose seem almost to\r\nanticipate the delicate, toned-down tints of modern Impressionism.\r\nHimself an ardent Revolutionist, he was, as it were, created to be the\r\nportrayer of those men of an austerity like Cato's, and those women with\r\ntheir free, masculine, proud gaze; that valiant generation that felt\r\nwithin itself a desire to begin civilisation again and found religion\r\nanew. The portrait of Lavoisier and his wife reminds one in its\r\nrefinement of Madame Vigée-Lebrun. The chemist is sitting by a table\r\ncovered with instruments; his wife, in an elegant light gown, bends\r\nattentively over him. The picture dates from 1788, and it still looks\r\nlike some good work of the age of Louis XVI. Again, how intimate is the\r\neffect of the marvellous portrait of Michael Gérard and his family. The\r\ngood man, in his shirt-sleeves, seems to feel really at home; a small\r\nboy is leaning against his knee, a girl is playing on the clavicorde.\r\nThere is not the slightest suggestion of pose or a conventional type of\r\nbeauty in this stout old gentleman sitting so comfortably in his\r\n_bourgeois négligé_, and with honest eyes gazing out so inquisitively\r\nround him. In a few other pictures the spiritual life of women is\r\nportrayed with remarkable tenderness. One of the earliest is the\r\nexceptionally fine portrait of his mother-in-law, Madame Pécoult, in\r\n1783; then, in 1790, the portrait of the Marquise d'Orvilliers, with\r\nthat expression of dreamy languor which plays round the eyes of the\r\nbeautiful woman. The Louvre possesses, in the portrait of Madame\r\nRécamier, perhaps the most charming and attractive woman's portrait that\r\nDavid ever painted. The beautiful Juliette lies stretched on a divan of\r\nantique pattern. She wears a white dress, her soft rosy feet are bare.\r\nThe arrangement of the room coquettes primly with that simplicity which\r\nwas paraded at the time. Apart from the divan, there is only a huge\r\nbronze candelabra to be seen. Then there is Barere's portrait. He stands\r\non the tribune, and delivers the speech which is to cost Louis XVI his\r\nlife. The face is small and insignificant, the gaze cold and harsh, and\r\non the mouth there is a shadow of bitter hate and narrow fanaticism. But\r\nthe triumph of these portraits of men is that of Bonaparte. David was\r\none of the first of the men of the Revolution to come beneath the spell\r\nof the Little Corporal. One day, while he was working in his studio at\r\nthe Louvre, a pupil rushed in breathlessly: \"General Bonaparte is\r\noutside the door!\" Napoleon entered in a dark-blue coat \"that made his\r\nlean yellow face look leaner and yellower than ever.\" David dismissed\r\nhis pupils, and drew, in a sitting of barely two hours, the stern head\r\nof the Corsican. Thus he passed into the service of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThis man, who viewed himself only as the coping-stone of the\r\nRepublic--after the example of Augustus when he transformed the Roman\r\nRepublic into the Empire--was unwilling to show any opposition to the\r\nrepublican tastes. The first painter of the Republic was appointed to be\r\nthe Imperial Court painter. What he had been under Robespierre he was\r\nunder Napoleon: the dictator of his age, who maintained a supremacy over\r\nthe whole of art similar to that which Lebrun held beneath Louis XIV.\r\nThe \"Marat\" was the great work of his revolutionary, the \"Coronation\" of\r\nhis monarchical period,--that colossal picture which, completed between\r\n1806 and 1807, has handed down to posterity a true representation of the\r\nceremonial pageants that took place in Notre Dame on 2nd December 1804.\r\nThe moment selected is when Napoleon places the crown, which is carried\r\non a velvet cushion by the Duc de Berg, upon the head of the Empress,\r\nwho kneels before him in a white robe and a crimson mantle. The picture\r\ncontains portraits of all the personages present at the ceremony,\r\namongst them being David himself, as he stands on a platform and\r\nsketches at a small table. The whole composition of this picture and the\r\ngrouping of the figures is full of stately gravity. Real energy and\r\npatience must have been required to paint this immense picture, though\r\nit shows not the least sign of fatigue. With the exception of Menzel's\r\n\"Coronation of William I,\" I know of no historical picture of the\r\ncentury of as high an artistic value, with the like noble sublimity of\r\ncolour, with so tender, quivering a light. There are certain portions of\r\nthe \"Coronation\" in which the white robes, the deep-red velvet of the\r\nmantles, and gold embroideries affect us like a symphony in colours.\r\nWhen the picture was completed Napoleon visited David's studio,\r\naccompanied by the Empress, his ministers, and his staff. The Court drew\r\nup, and the Emperor moved up and down in front of the picture, hat in\r\nhand, for more than half an hour, examining it in all its details.\r\nFinally, with one of those dramatic effects of which he was so fond, he\r\nlightly raised his hat: \"_C'est bien, très bien; David, je vous salue_.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DAVID.   BELISARIUS ASKING ALMS.]\r\n\r\nDavid had now still better opportunities than at an earlier period of\r\nproving his great capacity as a portrait painter. His portraits of the\r\nEmperor, of the Pope, of Cardinal Caprara, and of Murat symbolise the\r\nbrutal greatness of an age which worshipped strength. Even at the close\r\nof his life, when the Restoration had exiled him from France, there\r\nresulted in Brussels graceful and tenderly observed portraits, such as\r\nthat of the daughter of Joseph Bonaparte, which will perpetuate his\r\nname. One, in the Praet Collection at Brussels--three women of\r\nindescribable ugliness--marks the pinnacle of his pictorial strength and\r\nkeen naturalism. They are the \"Three Fates\" of 1810, and he has painted\r\nthem with the true artist's delight, and with a massiveness like that of\r\nFrans Hals.\r\n\r\nWhen these works were brought together at the Paris Exhibition of 1889,\r\nuniversal astonishment prevailed when it was discovered what a great\r\npainter this Louis David was. He appeared in these pictures as an artist\r\nwho stood completely within his age, who shared its passions and was\r\npermeated by its greatness; he even appeared as a _charmeur_ who handled\r\nthe phenomena of colour and light as few others have done. It is true,\r\nDavid showed himself in this favourable light at the exhibition only\r\nbecause the entirely archæological side of his talent was not\r\nrepresented. For at the bottom of his heart he too was an archæologist.\r\nMany of his works, such as \"The Death of Socrates,\" \"Brutus,\" \"The Oath\r\nin the Tennis Court,\" and \"The Rape of the Sabines,\" are specimens of a\r\nbarren theory.\r\n\r\nAgainst all the caprice of the eighteenth century, with its charming,\r\nalluring grace, he opposed a strict, inexorable system, as he believed\r\nhe saw it in the antique. Simplicity, however, beneath his hands became\r\ndryness, nobility formal. He saw in painting a sort of abstract geometry\r\nfor which there existed hard-and-fast forms. There was something\r\nmathematical in his effort after dry correctness and erudite accuracy.\r\nThe infinite variety of life with its eternal changes was hidden from\r\nhis sight. The beautiful, he taught with Winckelmann, does not exist in\r\na single individual; it is only possible to create a type of it by\r\ncomparison and through composition. The human being of art ought always\r\nto be a copy of that perfect being, primitive man, whom the Roman\r\nsculptors had still before their eyes, but who had deteriorated in the\r\ncourse of ages. Thus in France, too, the sensuous art of painting was\r\nconverted into an abstract science of æsthetics. The classic ideal\r\nweighed upon French art and prescribed for all alike the same \"heroic\r\nstyle,\" the same elevation, the same marble coldness and monotony of\r\ncolour. _Jean-Baptiste Regnault_, and _François André Vincent_, whose\r\nstudios were most frequented after David's, worshipped the same gods.\r\nAfter David's departure, _Guérin_, in particular, endeavoured to\r\nbequeath to the students those genuinely academic rules which his pupil,\r\nDelacroix, has summed up in these words: \"In order to make an ideal head\r\nof a negro, our teachers make him resemble as far as possible the\r\nprofile of Antinous, and then say, 'We have done our utmost; if he is,\r\nnevertheless, not beautiful, we must altogether abstain from this freak\r\nof nature, with his squat nose and thick lips, so unendurable to the\r\neyes.'\" When he had to paint his \"Insurrection in Cairo,\" therefore,\r\nEgyptians as well as Arabs must first be supplied with heads of Antinous\r\nand transformed from modern soldiers into ancient warriors, Romans of\r\nthe time of Romulus, before they could enter into the kingdom of art.\r\nEverything was sacrificed to line,--an inflexible, inexorable, correct,\r\nand icy line, the conventional, ideal line,--not the true line which\r\nfollows from observation of the infinite variety of nature.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, even in works constructed as these were by rule and line,\r\nwe cannot fail to be impressed by the technical ability displayed by the\r\nartist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  DAVID.   THE DEATH OF MARAT.]\r\n\r\nFrance, who in her outward relations has generally had a feverish\r\nlonging for change, has been in literary and artistic respects, as a\r\nrule, exceedingly conservative, has upheld authority, supported an\r\nacademy, and prized limitations and proportion above everything. They\r\nhad upset the monarchy, murdered the hated aristocrats, built up the\r\nrepublic, done away with Christianity before they ever thought of\r\ntouching the three unities of the drama. Voltaire, who had a reverence\r\nfor nothing in heaven or earth, respected the received treatment of the\r\nAlexandrine verse. And David, the great painter of the Revolution, who\r\ncast the pictures of Boucher out of the Louvre, and whose pupils used to\r\nshoot bread-crumbs at Watteau's masterpiece, the \"Voyage à Cythère,\" yet\r\nconveyed with him into the new age, as an inheritance from _rococo_, its\r\nprodigious knowledge. The good old traditions of the technique of French\r\npainting were little shaken by him and his school. The Academy described\r\nby Quatremère as the \"eternal nursery garden of incurable prejudices,\"\r\nwas indeed overthrown, but David became immediately the head of a new\r\none. This age of absorption in politics developed an art to correspond,\r\nmore disciplined than ever, girt round by an iron cuirass; and this art,\r\nnotwithstanding multifarious phases, at no time lost its touch,\r\ntechnically, with the acquisitions of former epochs, but evolved itself\r\nin its various directions from one centre, distracted from its path by\r\nnothing brought into it from outside. Géricault, Delacroix, Courbet, and\r\nManet, widely as they differ from one another, are links in one chain of\r\nevolution. Art comes from knowledge. This maxim, which David held in\r\nhonour, has remained to the present day a dominant force in French art,\r\nand by virtue of this knowledge, which David received from the old\r\nmasters and guarded as a sacred trust, France became in the nineteenth\r\ncentury the chief school of technique for all other nations. From the\r\nFrench the other nations learned their grammar and syntax; through them\r\nthey acquired a wider horizon and a deeper insight into the great\r\nmystery of nature.\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\nTHE ESCAPE INTO THE PAST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE NAZARENES\r\n\r\n\r\nHerein lies the great difference between France and Germany. Although\r\nfollowing along new lines, the art of France did not thereby suffer as\r\nregards the quality of its execution; in spite of all Classicism it\r\nremained the disciplined art of the schools. These favourable\r\npreliminaries were lacking in Germany. It was not allotted to German\r\npainting to grow up in naïve contentment with the technical inheritance\r\nof its forefathers, but, on the contrary, at the entrance of its new\r\ncareer it broke so completely with its predecessor--the art of the\r\neighteenth century--that it could no longer adopt even its technical\r\ntraditions. It arose out of the negation of earlier art, an absolute\r\nnegation such as the world had never seen before. It began with a\r\nself-made man who had never acquired the charter of craftsmanship, who\r\nnever learnt to paint. In France, revolutionary pictures inspired with\r\nintense pathos, and frankly naturalistic portraits of masterly\r\ntechnique; with Carstens, outlines showing refined feeling, but faulty\r\nvery generally in execution, sketches drawn roughly with the pencil,\r\ncrayon, or red chalk.\r\n\r\nIt had taken many generations of painters, whose lives had been spent in\r\ncareful devotion to the work, to collect the technical capital which\r\nCarstens so carelessly flung to the winds.\r\n\r\nThe next step along this way was taken by the Nazarenes.\r\n\r\nJust as it was inevitable that cold and lifeless Classicism should\r\nfollow the brightness and animation of _rococo_, so it was necessary,\r\naccording to the law of extremes which alternate in every evolution of\r\nculture, that, next to the antique, should come its exact opposite, the\r\nGothic or Middle Ages. The antique was so monotonous that people longed\r\nfor variety of colour again; it was so cold and statuesque that they\r\nlonged for something soulful, so Greek and pagan and severe that they\r\nhankered again after something Christian, would believe again like\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nEven in the young days of the old pagan, Goethe, religion formed the\r\nfavourite topic of the _beaux esprits_, and in the same year, 1797, that\r\nCarstens died, this cult of the emotional life found, for the first\r\ntime, expression in literature. In every library one finds a dainty,\r\nfinely printed book in small octavo, without the author's name, with the\r\ntitle _Herzensergiessungen eines Kunstliebenden Klosterbruders_, and\r\nwith a sort of head of Raphael as a frontispiece, in which, with his\r\nprominent eyes, full lips, and long neck, he looks like some\r\nintellectual, Christ-inspired, consumptive enthusiast. It is the pale,\r\ngentle face of Wackenroder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FREDERICK OVERBECK.]\r\n\r\nFirst Winckelmann, then Wackenroder. In the very personalities of these\r\ntwo the whole opposition between Classicism and the Nazarenes is\r\nreflected. A student barely twenty years old, a mild, modest,\r\ncontemplative soul, who had attached himself from early youth with\r\nwomanly devotion to his more energetic friend Tieck, and written letters\r\nto him that read like a young girl's effusions to her sweetheart, he\r\nentered the Erlanger University with his friend at the Easter of 1793.\r\nThey saw Nuremberg. More than once they made pilgrimages to the old\r\nfashioned town, the treasury of German art; and the spirit of the past\r\npowerfully inspired them. Whilst for Lessing and Winckelmann \"Gothic\"\r\nart only meant barbarian art, the wonders of Nuremberg were now observed\r\nwith fresh eyes. In a sort of intoxication of art the friends wandered\r\nthrough churches, stood by the graves of Albrecht Dürer and Peter\r\nVischer, and a vanished world rose before them. The spires and turrets\r\nbehind falling walls and ramparts, the old, stately, patrician houses,\r\nwhich jutted out their oriel windows, as it were with curiosity, into\r\nthe crooked streets, were peopled to their imagination with picturesque\r\nfigures in bonnet and hose from that great time when Nuremberg was \"the\r\nliving, swarming school of native art,\" when \"an exuberant, artistic\r\nspirit\" governed within its walls, when Master Hans Sachs and Adam Kraft\r\nand Peter Vischer and Albrecht Dürer and Willibald Pirkheymer were\r\nalive. Shortly after that they came to Dresden, and devoted themselves\r\nin the gallery there to an enthusiastic cult of the Madonna. The\r\n_Herzensergiessungen eines Kunstliebenden Klosterbruders_, which\r\nappeared a year before Wackenroder's death in his twenty-sixth year, was\r\nthe result of these wanderings and studies. In this tender production of\r\na visionary youth the spirit of Romantic art found expression.\r\n\r\nWinckelmann was an archæologist; Wackenroder, an enthusiast of the\r\nMiddle Ages; on the one side knowledge only, on the other all feeling;\r\nfor the one, paganism, for the other, Christ. For it is from the first a\r\nleading principle of the \"_Klosterbruder_,\" that \"the finest stream of\r\nlife only issues from the streams of art and religion when they flow in\r\ncompany.\" He valued the older painters \"because they had made painting\r\nthe true handmaid of religion\"; art was to him an object of devotion.\r\nPicture galleries, he says, ought to be temples; he would liken the\r\nenjoyment of works of art to prayer; let it be a holy feast day to him\r\nif he go with a serious and composed mind to their observance; indeed,\r\nreverence for art and reverence for God were so closely interwoven that\r\nhe was fain to kneel down before art, and offer it the homage of an\r\n\"eternal and boundless love.\" This devotion to art, of which he himself\r\nwas full, he found nowhere in his times. The age of enlightenment was to\r\nhim an undevout and inartistic age. Only in his wanderings through the\r\nuneven streets of Nuremberg did the deepest yearning of his soul seem\r\nsatisfied. He applied himself to mediæval, and especially to German art.\r\nHis standpoint is the same which the young Goethe had adopted when he\r\nintervened with Herder for \"German style and art,\" and dedicated his\r\npamphlet on German architecture to the shade of Erwin von Steinbach. He\r\nis reluctant that one should condemn the Middle Ages because they did\r\nnot build such temples as the Greeks, any more than that one should\r\ncondemn the Indians because they spoke their language and not our own.\r\n\"It is not only beneath Italian skies, under majestic domes and\r\nCorinthian columns, that true art thrives, it lives too under pointed\r\narches, intricately decorated buildings, and Gothic spires.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OVERBECK.   THE ANNUNCIATION.]\r\n\r\nIt was all said so simply and heartily that soon the whole world began\r\nto be \"Wackenroderite.\" The ingenious and enthusiastic youth was\r\nsucceeded by theoretic reasoners. Tieck, who published his _Phantasies\r\nupon Art_ in 1799, after Wackenroder's death, and amplified it with his\r\nown explanations, was no longer a genuine but a counterfeit\r\n\"_Klosterbruder_.\" He first played with Catholicism, and uttered the\r\nmomentous sentence: \"The best of the later masters up to the most recent\r\ntimes have had no other aim than to imitate some one of the primitive or\r\ntypical artists, or even several together; nor have they easily become\r\ngreat by any other method than by having successfully imitated\r\nsomebody.\" His _Sternbald_ is still more haunted by the spirit of\r\nmonastic devotion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OVERBECK.   THE NAMING OF ST. JOHN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OVERBECK.   CHRIST HEALING THE SICK.]\r\n\r\nThe particular starting-point was in this case too, as it had been\r\nbefore for Winckelmann, the Dresden Gallery, where, at the turn of the\r\ncentury, Augustus William and Frederick Schlegel, the two\r\n\"_Gotter-buben_,\" held their cultured rendezvous. \"The Schlegels had\r\ntaken possession of the gallery,\" wrote Dora Stock, \"and with Schelling\r\nand Gries spent almost every morning there. It was a joy to see them\r\nwriting and teaching there. Sometimes they talked to me about art. I\r\nfelt myself often quite paltry, I was so far from any wisdom. Fichte,\r\ntoo, they initiated into their secrets. You would have laughed if you\r\ncould have seen them drag him about and assail him with their\r\nconvictions.\" The journal _Europa_, founded by Frederick Schlegel in\r\n1803, became the rallying-point of the new movement, and his articles\r\npublished therein contained the germs of all the efforts and errors of\r\nthe young school. In his discourse on Raphael he compares the\r\npre-Raphaelite period with that succeeding it, and considers the\r\nproposition that \"indubitably the corruption of art was originally\r\nbrought about by the newer school which was marked by Raphael, Titian,\r\nCorreggio, Giulio Romano, and Michael Angelo\" so unquestionable that he\r\ndoes not find it in the least necessary to prove it. He casually puts\r\nforward as an _obiter dictum_ dropped in amongst a series of quite\r\nopposed notions the idea that every art ought to have a national\r\nfoundation, and that any imitation of a foreign form of art is\r\ndeleterious. The result follows that it is to be deplored \"that an evil\r\ngenius has alienated artists from the circle of ideas and the subjects\r\nof the old painters. Culture can only attach itself to what has been\r\nconstituted. How natural it would be, then, if painters were to go on in\r\nthe old way, and cast themselves anew into the ideas and disposition of\r\nthe old painters.\" The artist should follow the painters prior to\r\nRaphael, \"especially the oldest,\" should strive to \"copy carefully\r\ntheir truth and simplicity long enough for it to become second nature to\r\nhis eye\"; or he may \"select the style of the old German school as a\r\npattern.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OVERBECK.   CHRIST'S ENTRY INTO JERUSALEM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OVERBECK.   THE RESURRECTION.]\r\n\r\nThe latter counsel originated from the discovery in 1804 of the Cologne\r\nCathedral picture, referred to by Schlegel in his _Europa_. Through the\r\nsecularisation of the monasteries, attention was again directed to the\r\nold ecclesiastical pictures which people had hitherto passed by\r\nunnoticed. From the monasteries, churches, guild halls, and castles\r\nwhich the French had plundered, countless masses of paintings of every\r\nsort were extricated. A great deal perished; nearly all, however, that\r\nhad hitherto been kept as heirlooms, and for the most part almost\r\ninaccessible, now became movable, attainable property. The brothers\r\nBoisserée began their celebrated collection, which is to be seen to-day\r\nin the Munich _Pinakothek_. While hitherto one had, at the most, known\r\nof Dürer, now one touched upon an age which lay behind the Reformation,\r\nan age in which Catholicism was flourishing, in which \"not great artists\r\nbut nameless monks represented art,\" and it was soon all fire and ardour\r\nover the sweetness, naïveté, and faith of these pictures. Fernow had\r\nstill pronounced generally against the capacity of the \"Catholic\r\nreligion, with its Jewish-Christian mythology and martyrology,\" to\r\nsatisfy the demands of a pure taste in art. Carstens had written down\r\nfor himself the sentence from Webb's work: \"The art of the ancients was\r\nrich in august and captivating figures: their gods had grace, majesty,\r\nand beauty. How much meaner is the lot of the moderns! Their art is\r\nsubservient to the priests. Their characters are taken from the lowest\r\nspheres of life--men of humble descent and uncouth manners. Even their\r\nDivine Master is in painting nowhere to be seen according to a great\r\nidea; His long, smooth hair, His Jewish beard and sickly appearance\r\nwould deprive the most exalted beings of any semblance of dignity.\r\nMeekness and humility, His characteristic traits, are virtues edifying\r\nin the extreme but in no way picturesque. This lack of dignity in the\r\nsubject renders it intelligible why we look so coldly at these works in\r\nthe churches and galleries. The genius of painting expends its strength\r\nin vain on Crucifixions, Holy Families, Last Suppers, and the like.\" Not\r\nfive years had elapsed after Carstens' death when, according to an\r\nimpression of Dorothea Veit, \"Christianity was once more the order of\r\nthe day.\" William Schlegel's poem, _The Church's Alliance with the\r\nArts_, from which, later, Overbeck borrowed the thought for his\r\npicture, can be looked upon, as Goethe already wrote, as the true\r\nprofession of faith of the young school. Where previously Augustus\r\nWilliam had described in his sonnets the Io, Leda, and Cleopatra of the\r\nDresden Gallery, it was now the Madonna who received the homage of the\r\ngallant poet. By Frederick, Christianity was recommended to the artist\r\nas a formal model and a source of æsthetic enjoyment,--as it was, at the\r\nsame time, by Chateaubriand as _prédilection d'artiste_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  OVERBECK.   THE SEVEN LEAN YEARS.]\r\n\r\nEven more profound did the tendency become during the War of\r\nIndependence, which at the same time gave the death blow to Classicism.\r\nDistress taught how to pray. In those years of humiliation the young\r\ngeneration abandoned the classic ideal for ever, and Schenkendorf cried\r\nimperiously: \"We would see no more pagan pictures on any German walls.\"\r\nFrench \"frivolity\" was contrasted with German seriousness, German\r\nChristianity with the free-thought of the French; there was a return\r\nfrom the cold philosophy of enlightenment to the vigorous feeling of\r\nmediæval faith.\r\n\r\nFrederick Schlegel, the author of _Lucinde_, who had written as lately\r\nas 1799:--\r\n\r\n  \"Mein einzig Religion ist die,\r\n   Dass ich liebe ein schönes Knie,\r\n   Volle Brust und schlanke Hüften,\r\n   Dazu Blumen mit süssen Düften,\"\r\n\r\nwas converted to Catholicism. Schelling wrote his _Philosophy of\r\nRevelation_; Görres, the editor of the _Rothen Blut_, ended as the\r\nauthor of the _Christian Mystic_.\r\n\r\nHere set in the period of the Nazarenes. What Schlegel had said was to\r\nbecome true, that the German artist has either no character at all or he\r\nmust have the character of the mediæval masters, true-hearted and\r\nthoughtful, innocent withal, and somewhat maladroit. In architecture the\r\nHellenic school is succeeded by the Gothic, painting passes from the\r\nreverence of the Greek statues to that of old Italian pictures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  JULIUS SCHNORR VON CAROLSFELD.]\r\n\r\nRome remained for the Nazarenes, too, the centre of influence, only they\r\nno longer made pilgrimages, like the Classicists, to ancient but to\r\nChristian Rome. _Overbeck_ of Lübeck came in 1810 with Pforr of\r\nFrankfort and Vogel of Zürich; the Düsseldorfer, Cornelius, followed in\r\n1811, _Schadow_ and _Veit_ of Berlin in 1815, _Schnorr von Carolsfeld_\r\nof Leipzig in 1818, the Viennese _Führich_ and _Steinle_ in 1827 and\r\n1828. In all of them there lived the perception that in such a serious\r\nage men should be of high moral endeavour, and art the expression of the\r\nreligious capacity of their lives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Wigand, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  SCHNORR.   ADAM AND EVE AFTER THE FALL.]\r\n\r\nThere still stands to-day, on a secluded hillock of the Monte Pincio a\r\nsmall church, whose façade is adorned with the statues of St. Isidore,\r\nthe patron of husbandmen, and of St. Patrick, apostle of Ireland. A\r\ncourt with weather-beaten cloisters and an old well separates the church\r\nfrom the monastery which lies behind it, where the cells of the monks,\r\nIrish and Italian Franciscans, are placed. Above, on the terrace of the\r\nhouse, one has a charming view of Rome and the Campagna, of Monte Cavo\r\nand the heights of Tusculum. Below stretch the gardens of the Capucin\r\nConvent, and farther back the grounds and avenues of the Villa Ludovisi.\r\nOn the first floor is a large hall, the walls of which have been\r\ndecorated by the hand of some old monk with frescoes, and which,\r\nformerly a refectory, is used to-day as a theological lecture-room. This\r\nwas the room where Overbeck and his friends in the first period after\r\ntheir arrival stood for one another as models. Lethière, the director of\r\nthe French Academy, had obtained permission for them to install\r\nthemselves in the deserted rooms of the monastery of San Isidoro, which\r\nhad been spared by Napoleon, for which they paid the small sum of three\r\nscudi monthly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSEPH FÜHRICH.   _Graphische Kunst._]\r\n\r\n\"We led a truly monastic life,\" relates Overbeck; \"held ourselves aloof\r\nfrom all, and lived only for art. In the morning we marketed together;\r\nat midday we took it in turns to cook our dinner, which was composed of\r\nnothing but a soup and a pudding, or some tasty vegetable, and was\r\nseasoned only by earnest conversation on art.\" Overbeck, as a good\r\nhousekeeper, kept accounts; the principal items of the daily outlay\r\noccurred for polenta and risotto, oranges and lemons; every now and then\r\noil, too, was noted down. The afternoons were dedicated to the study of\r\nthe creations of art in Rome. With \"beating hearts and holy awe\" they\r\npassed over the threshold of the _Stanze_. In the chapel of San Lorenzo\r\nthey became \"familiar with the seraphic Fiesole, whose frescoes\r\ntranscend everything in purity of conception.\" They shunned the paganism\r\nof St. Peter's, and marvelled with all the more intimate devotion at the\r\nold Christian monuments. The churches of San Lorenzo and San Clemente,\r\nthe cloisters of St. John Lateran and St. Paul's-without-the-Walls, made\r\nan ineffaceable impression upon the young men. At the twilight hour they\r\nwandered up on to Monte Cavo. \"And of evenings we drew studies of\r\ndrapery--glorious folds!--from Pforr's big Venetian mantle, in which we\r\ntook turns to pose for one another.\" Their whole hearts, however, first\r\nswelled when they undertook a journey to Tuscany. In Orvieto, Luca\r\nSignorelli awaited them, whose frescoes especially impressed Cornelius\r\nmightily. At Sienna they found teachers who were still more sympathetic\r\nto them, Duccio and Simone Martino, those masters of a tender, intimate\r\nspirit and a charming sweetness of expression. In the Campo Santo at\r\nPisa they turned their attention to Fiesole's pupil, Gozzoli. Those\r\nbecame their great teachers in art. \"Just as ardent Christians wander to\r\nthe grave of the princes of the apostles in order to confirm their faith\r\nand quicken their zeal, so should zealous young artists derive strength\r\nand illumination from the silent and yet so eloquent speech of the\r\nsublime geniuses of art. An artist of real worth will find in the\r\nmasterpieces of painting at Rome everything necessary for him in order\r\nto reach the right path. But, to be sure, a well-made plait of hair does\r\nnot certainly constitute one a Raphael, because Raphael, too, arranged\r\nhis hair with feeling. Study alone leads to nothing. If since Raphael's\r\nage, as one can almost declare, there has been no painter, that is the\r\nfault of nothing else than of the fact that art has been vanquished by\r\nworkmanship. One learnt at the academies to paint excellent drapery, to\r\ndraw a correct figure, learnt perspective, architecture--in short,\r\neverything, and yet no painter was produced. There is one want in all\r\nrecent painting--heart, soul, sentiment. Let the young painter then\r\nwatch, before everything, over his sentiments: let him allow neither an\r\nimpure word on his lips nor an impure thought in his mind. But how can\r\nhe guard himself from that? By religion, by study of the Bible, the one\r\nand only study which made Raphael. This view now certainly contradicts\r\nthe accustomed principles that everything must be systematically learnt;\r\nmere learning produces certainly an instructed but also a cold artist.\r\nOn that ground it is not good either to study anatomy from dead bodies,\r\nbecause one dwarfs thereby certain fine sensibilities, or to work from\r\nfemale models, for the same reason. Let the painter be inspired by his\r\nsubject as those of old were, and the result will be the same. Like\r\nthose old painters, let every artist remind himself that the truest use\r\nof art is that which leads it heavenwards, its one function that of\r\nhaving a moral effect upon men.\" \"How pure and holy,\" cries Cornelius to\r\nXeller, as late as 1858, \"was the end at which we aimed! Unknown,\r\nwithout encouragement, without aid, except that of our loving Father in\r\nheaven.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FÜHRICH.   FROM THE \"LEGEND OF ST. GWENDOLIN.\"]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that between the ascetics of the monastery and the\r\nClassicists direct friction must ensue. To them the \"ever repeated and\r\npale reflexions of Greek sculpture\" said nothing, while the Classicists\r\nscoffed at the religionists, for whom the sarcastic brawler, Reinhart,\r\ninvented the nickname of \"Nazarenes,\" which has since become a\r\nwatchword. The opposition was historically immortalised when Bunsen, the\r\nPrussian envoy, invited the whole colony to the christening of his\r\nlittle daughter, and Niebuhr touched glasses with Thorwaldsen \"to the\r\nhealth of old Jupiter.\" Only Cornelius joined in; the others started and\r\nlooked upon the young Düsseldorfer as a heretic.\r\n\r\nThis positive Christian standpoint, which allowed art to be esteemed\r\nonly as a religious service, pictures only as a means of ecclesiastical\r\nedification, irritated also the old man of Weimar at the first start.\r\nThe effort of the Nazarenes to make piety the foundation of true\r\nartistic activity was to him a continual subject of contempt. Religion\r\nno more bestows talent for the arts than it gives taste. He spoke with\r\nirony of the \"valiant artists and ingenious friends of art who had\r\nresort to the honourable, naïve, yet somewhat coarse taste\" of the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth-century masters. He constantly employed of them\r\nthe expression \"star-gazing.\" He had already mockingly remarked of\r\nWackenroder's _Herzensergiessungen_ what an unwarrantable conclusion it\r\nwas, that because a few monks were artists, all artists should therefore\r\nbe monks. He called the life of the Nazarenes \"a sort of masquerade\r\nwhich stood in opposition to the actual day,\" and wrote in the pages of\r\n_Art and Antiquity_ that manifesto, the _New German Religious-Patriotic\r\nArt_, or _History of the New Pietistic False Art since the Eighties_,\r\nwhich so deeply wounded the young enthusiasts. \"The doctrine was that\r\nthe artist needed piety above everything to equal the work of the best.\r\nWhat an attractive doctrine! How eagerly we should accept it! For in\r\norder to become religious one need learn nothing.\" The whole movement\r\nreached nothing beyond a slavish imitation of Giotto and his immediate\r\nfollowers. Of course, it was inconsistent of Goethe to reproach\r\ncontemporary art for imitating that of the Middle Ages, and to praise\r\nthe latter only when it imitated the antique. Speaking as a man of\r\nMengs' school, and merely proposing Hellenic art as a canon instead of\r\nearly Italian, he had, after all, no right to be angry if Frederick\r\nSchlegel opposed classical models with mediæval. Otherwise, however,\r\neven to-day little can be added to Goethe's animadversions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FÜHRICH.   RUTH AND BOAZ.]\r\n\r\nAs with Carstens, so with the Nazarenes, we are warned by the idealistic\r\ntendency which inspired the young enthusiasts. There are but few\r\npainters with whom life and art have been in such complete agreement as\r\nwith the gentle, mild, and modest Overbeck, the \"Apostle John,\" as he\r\ngot to be called, that young man, that serene soul who looked upon art\r\nsimply as a harp of David for the praise of the Lord, to whom the \"hope\r\nthat through his works one soul had been strengthened in faith and piety\r\nwas of far more value than any fame,\" and who ended at last in a sort of\r\nreligious mania. With the Nazarenes, too, as with the Classicists, it\r\nwas pure exaltation which drove them to free themselves from the\r\ntrammels of the school, in order to get back from dead fabrications to\r\ncreations of art, which, proceeding out of the living spirit, once more\r\nhad a soul. Even the much-despised conversion of the Protestants among\r\nthem to the Catholic Church arose out of the deep conviction that they\r\nalso, as well as their art, must be united in religion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FÜHRICH.   THE DEPARTURE OF THE PRODIGAL SON.]\r\n\r\nIn a certain sense they even show an advance in art. They found between\r\nthemselves and the great painters of the eighteenth century a gulf that\r\ncould no longer be spanned. After Carstens had thrown overboard every\r\ncolouristic acquisition, it was indeed something that the Nazarenes no\r\nlonger saw the highest aim of painting in black and white design, but\r\nturned, though with timidity and hesitation, to the study of the Italian\r\nQuattrocento with its joyous delight in colour, and so became the first\r\nreal painters after the cartoon period. Only that was as yet simply an\r\nadvance for the nineteenth century, and not especially for the history\r\nof art. This was as little enriched with new forms and discoveries by\r\nthe Nazarenes as by the Classicists. The former, too, were imitators,\r\nand only changed masters when they fled from the antique to the Middle\r\nAges, and copied the old Italians in lieu of the Greeks. The Classicists\r\nhad imitated with a certain cold erudition; the Nazarenes out of the\r\ndepths of their emotion. As the former used Greeks, so did they use the\r\nfourteenth-century painters, as patterns of calligraphy from which they\r\nmade their copies, cut their stencils after the Italian form, and, like\r\nMengs, were able to reproduce in their works only a very weak reflection\r\nof those departed spirits. As eclectics they would stand on the same\r\nrung with the academics of Bologna, except that the ideal of the latter\r\nschool was a combination from Leonardo, Raphael, Michael Angelo,\r\nCorreggio, and Titian, and that it possessed an incomparably greater\r\nfacility in technique.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FÜHRICH.   JACOB AND RACHEL.]\r\n\r\nThe Nazarenes abandoned on principle the employment of the model, from\r\nfear lest it might entice them away from the ideal representation of the\r\ncharacter to be depicted. They sought in a dilettante manner to supply\r\nthe control over the material which alone makes the artist, by\r\nenthusiasm for the material. Only Cornelius dared to draw from the\r\nfemale form. Overbeck refused to do so, from modesty. The Virgin Mary\r\nwas to him the highest ideal of womanhood, the paler, the more virtuous,\r\nthe more akin to the Lamb of God; and he would have deemed it a\r\nsacrilege to have depicted her as purely womanly. They therefore only\r\noccasionally sat to one another for studies of drapery, and, for the\r\nrest, \"in order not to be naturalistic,\" painted their pictures from\r\nimagination in the seclusion of their cells. As the Catholicism of\r\nSchlegel was an anæmic system, so the painters, too, deprived their\r\nfigures of blood and being in order to leave them only the abstract\r\nbeauty of line. They are beings who are exalted above everything, even\r\nabove correctness of drawing, and who must expire of a lack of blood in\r\ntheir veins. The command, \"Seek ye therefore first the kingdom of God,\r\nand His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you,\"\r\nwas carried out by the Nazarenes only too well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEINLE.   THE RAISING OF JAIRUS' DAUGHTER.]\r\n\r\nThey have created only two works which will survive, and which possess\r\nan historical significance as pre-eminent, works of the whole movement\r\nin common--the frescoes of the Casa Bartholdi and of the Villa Massini.\r\n\r\nWhen the intelligence of the Battle of Waterloo had penetrated even into\r\nthe silent cells of the monks, they believed that art too should\r\nparticipate in this universal elevation, and become a factor again in\r\nthe development of the German nation. It must not be used, wrote\r\nCornelius in his famous letter to Görres, as a mere plaything, or to\r\ntickle the senses, not merely for the delectation and pomp of high and\r\nrich Maecenases, but for the ennoblement and glorification of public\r\nlife. The means of this artistic elevation, and at the same time a new\r\nmeans of popular culture, was to be the introduction of fresco painting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEINLE.   \"I HAVE TRODDEN THE WINEPRESS ALONE: AND OF\r\n  THE PEOPLE THERE WAS NONE WITH ME.\"]\r\n\r\nAnd thus the Brothers of San Isidoro re-discovered what had, as a matter\r\nof fact, always been quietly practiced by the \"rustics painters,\" but\r\nsince Mengs' time had no longer been employed by the \"art painters,\" and\r\nhad been forgotten for half a century. The Prussian consul at Rome,\r\nBartholdy, gave them the commission. An old mason, who had last arranged\r\nwall-plastering under Mengs, was recruited as technical adviser; Carl\r\nEggers, of Neustrelitz, zealously made chemical researches; and it is\r\nsaid to have been Veit who, at Cornelius' request (\"Now, Philip, you\r\nmake the first attempt!\"), was the first to paint the portrait of a head\r\nin fresco, whilst his companions looked on with amazement and delight.\r\nThen the others set to work, \"and painted away at it in the name of\r\nGod.\" \"Yes, believe me, my friend, it is a desperate matter to paint\r\nover a whole room in a manner which one has never before practised\r\noneself nor seen practised by others. Every day we tell each other that\r\nwe are fine bunglers, and give each other a regular dressing down. You\r\ncan have no conception how strange it feels at first when one is\r\nconfronted by damp plaster and lime. And nevertheless we construct\r\ndaily fresh castles in the air for painting churches, monasteries, and\r\npalaces in Germany.\"\r\n\r\nThe frescoes represent, in six mural paintings and two lunettes, the\r\nhistory of Joseph in Egypt, from his sale to his recognition by his\r\nbrethren. The two latter are the work of Cornelius and Overbeck, the\r\nothers of Veit and Schadow. The work was prolonged through many years,\r\ninterrupted by manifold difficulties, and when one stands to-day before\r\nthe transferred pictures in the Berlin National Gallery one cannot\r\nrefrain from admiring them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWARD STEINLE.]\r\n\r\nThere lives within them an unpretentiousness and sincerity of sentiment,\r\nand, in spite of all deficiencies and lack of independence, somewhat of\r\nthat lofty inspiration which raises the pictures of really earnest\r\nartists, even if they are faulty, far above any fabricated productions.\r\nAn association of young men, which, unconcerned about success and\r\nmaterial profit, contended only for ideal products, found here for the\r\nfirst time an opportunity to display what it wanted. In the\r\ninterpretation of Pharaoh's dream and in the recognition by the\r\nbrethren, Cornelius, in formal language, full of character, and without\r\nany phrases and posture, displayed all that he had derived from the\r\ngreat Italians in nobility of grouping and fine arrangement of lines.\r\nOverbeck reaches the same height in his allegory of the seven lean kine.\r\nBut it is not only as youthful works of artists, who, if they belonged\r\nto a period of decadence, yet were, withal, the greatest representatives\r\nof a period of German art, that these pictures are worthy of high\r\nesteem; they are essentially the best that these masters have created.\r\nCornelius, notably, shows a study, a care for execution, indeed even a\r\nharmony of colouring, that stands in surprising opposition to his later\r\nnegligence. From the conception that the artistic performance is\r\ndetermined in the invention, and the design, but that the pictorial\r\nexecution is an indifferent, mechanical accessory which could be\r\nsupplied even by other people, he was at that time still free.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEINLE.   BOOK ILLUSTRATION.]\r\n\r\nWhen the pictures had been unveiled in 1819 a festival of German artists\r\nwas held in Rome. Rückert, Bunsen, the Humboldts, the Herzes were there;\r\nCornelius, Veit, and Overbeck had arranged the transparencies. \"The\r\ncentre of all,\" writes the Danish romantic Atterbom, was the Crown\r\nPrince Ludwig of Bavaria, \"the idol of every German artist, whose ruling\r\npassion is for the fine arts and fair ladies. Everything was in old\r\nGerman masques, the ladies in wide ruffs. The Crown Prince was in the\r\nutmost good humour, and treated the artists as his equals. A toast was\r\ndrunk to German unity. The scene struck me like a beautiful dream out of\r\nthe Middle Ages.\" German unity at a Roman fancy ball! The German nation\r\na beautiful dream out of the Middle Ages! The Crown Prince Ludwig, when\r\nhe took Cornelius and Schnorr out of the Roman circle, at least created\r\na fatherland for German art, and later on the others also found at home\r\na suitable sphere of activity.\r\n\r\nPhilip Veit, who went to Frankfort in 1830 as Director of the Staedel\r\nInstitute, was the first to settle down, and for all his energy could\r\nonly for a very short time make that city into a seat of the Christian\r\ntendency in art. Of his pictures there, the fresco painted for the\r\nStaedel Institute, \"The Introduction of Christianity into Germany by St.\r\nBoniface,\" is by far the most important. The apostle has hewn down the\r\noak of Thor, and from where it once stood there flows forth the new\r\nspring of Christianity. The old Germans shrink back timorously, but the\r\nyouths listen to the preacher, and follow his direction to the figure of\r\nreligion which approaches with the palm of peace. In the background a\r\nchurch rises, and in the distance, by a limpid river, a flourishing\r\ntown, in contrast to the sombre, primeval forest to which the Germans\r\nwho reject religion are flying.\r\n\r\n\"The two Marys at the Sepulchre,\" in the Berlin National Gallery, and\r\nthe \"Assumption,\" in the Frankfort Cathedral, date from a later period.\r\nIt was of no avail to him that he mingled with his Nazarenism a certain\r\nair of the world, which found expression in a less ascetic language of\r\nform and a somewhat stronger sense of colour. In 1841 he had already a\r\nfeeling that the restless, struggling age had passed him by. He\r\nabandoned his post and went to meet oblivion as Director of the Gallery\r\nat Mayence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Munich, Albert._\r\n\r\n  STEINLE.   THE VIOLIN PLAYER.]\r\n\r\nOverbeck, the only one who could not tear himself from Rome, remained,\r\ntill his death in 1869, the \"Young German Raphael,\" as his father had\r\ncalled him in a letter from Lübeck in 1811: a devout, religious poet,\r\npure of soul and of fine culture, as one-coloured and one-sided as he\r\nwas mild and tender. At the outset he knew, at least, how to extract\r\nfrom the old masters a certain naïve piety without positive character,\r\nwhereas later he lost himself more and more in the arid formalism of\r\ndead dogmas. What was in his power to give he has given in pictures such\r\nas the \"Entry of Christ into Jerusalem\" and the \"Weeping over the Body\r\nof Christ\"--both in the Marienkirche at Lübeck, in the \"Miracle of\r\nRoses,\" in Santa Maria Degli Angeli at Assisi, in the \"Christ on the\r\nMount of Olives\" in the Hospital at Hamburg, and the \"Betrothal of Mary\"\r\nin the Berlin National Gallery--pictures which expressed nothing that\r\nwould not have been expressed better at the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. His \"Holy Family with St. John and the Lamb,\" of 1825, in the\r\nMunich Pinakothek, is in composition and type a complete imitation of\r\nthe Florentine Raphael; his \"Lamentation of Christ\" in the Lübeck\r\nMarienkirche is reminiscent of Perugino; his \"Burial\" would never have\r\nexisted but for Raphael's picture in the Borghese Gallery. His sentiment\r\ncoincided exactly in devotion and godliness with that of Fra Angelico or\r\nof the old masters of Cologne, and when he devoted himself to\r\nprogramme-painting he lost all intelligibility. In the \"Triumph of\r\nReligion in the Arts,\" which he completed in 1846 for the Staedel\r\nInstitute, and in which he wished to embody the favourite ideas of\r\nRomanticism, that art and religion must flow together in one stream, he\r\nhas copied the upper part from the \"Disputa,\" the lower part from the\r\n\"School of Athens,\" and worked up both into a tedious and scholastically\r\nelaborated whole. It is only through a series of unpretentious sketches\r\nwhich he prepared for engravings, lithographs, and woodcuts that his\r\nname has still a certain lustre. Plates such as the \"Rest in the\r\nFlight,\" the \"Preaching of St. John,\" or the series \"Forty Illustrations\r\nto the Gospel,\" the \"Passion,\" the \"Seven Sacraments,\" may be\r\ncontemplated even to-day, since in them at least no tastelessness of\r\ncolour stands in the way. These plates, too, like his pictures, are less\r\nobserved than felt--felt, however, with an innocence and cheerfulness of\r\nheart often quite childlike.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILIP VEIT.]\r\n\r\nIt shows above all much self-understanding that all these masters in\r\ntheir later years restricted themselves exclusively to design, which\r\nbetter expressed their character. In compositions and sketches of this\r\nkind, which were only _drawn_, and were thus untrammelled by the\r\nfruitless struggle with the difficulties of the technique of painting\r\nand a complete lack of the notion of colour, they moved more freely and\r\nlightly. In their frescoes and oil-paintings, partly through\r\ninsufficient technique, partly through their all too servile imitation\r\nof foreign ideals, they went astray. As draughtsmen, they had more\r\ncourage to be themselves, and while in the completer paintings many a\r\nfine trait, many an intimate reflection of the soul was lost, or through\r\nthe obduracy of the material did not attain a right expression, here\r\ntheir spiritual and emotional qualities can be better valued.\r\n\r\nJoseph Führich, one of the most staunchly convinced champions of these\r\nreactionary tendencies, has become, entirely owing to his extensive\r\nactivity as a draughtsman, somewhat more familiar to our modern\r\nknowledge than most of his contemporaries. He had begun as a\r\ndraughtsman. As a student of the Prague Academy he was an enthusiast for\r\nSchlegel, Novalis, and Tieck; and even before his journey to Rome he had\r\netched fifteen plates for Tieck's _Genoveva_. It was Dürer who exercised\r\nthe deciding influence upon his further development. He had been led to\r\nhim through Wackenroder, and had copied his \"Marienleben\" in 1821. \"Here\r\nI saw,\" he says in his Autobiography, \"a form before me which stood in\r\ntrenchant opposition to that of the Classicists, who are anxious to palm\r\noff as beauty their smoothness and pomposity borrowed from the\r\nmisunderstood antique, and their affected delicacy as grace. In contrast\r\nwith that absence of character which prevailing academic art mistakes\r\nfor beauty I saw here a keen and mighty characterisation which dominated\r\nthe figures through and through, making them, as it were, into old\r\nacquaintances.\" The strong and godly German middle age took then in\r\nFührich's heart the same place which the Italian Quattrocento had filled\r\nin Overbeck's range of thought. And this old-German tendency was only\r\ntemporarily interrupted by his sojourn in Rome. After he came to Rome in\r\n1826 he became a Nazarene, and was accustomed there to look back at the\r\ntendencies of his youth as an error; and both at Prague, where he\r\nreturned in 1829, after collaborating at the frescoes in the Villa\r\nMassini, and at Vienna, where from 1841 he held the post of professor in\r\nthe Academy, he found rich opportunity for putting into practice his\r\necclesiastical and orthodox views of art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEIT.   THE ARTS INTRODUCED INTO GERMANY BY CHRISTIANITY.]\r\n\r\nHis frescoes in the Johannis-und-Altleschenfelder Church in Vienna are,\r\nperhaps, more harmonious in colour, but no more independent in form,\r\nthan the works of the others. In his old age he returned once more to\r\nthe impressions of his youth, and so found himself again.\r\n\r\nAs a boy, in his little native village of Kratzau, in Bohemia, he had\r\ntended the cows in summer time and had acquired a certain sincere\r\nknowledge of nature and shepherd-life. He had to thank Dürer for his\r\npreference for the idyllic and patriarchal family scenes in Sacred\r\nHistory, and these tendencies found pleasing expression in pictures like\r\n\"Jacob and Rachel,\" or \"The Passage of Mary across the Mountains.\" No\r\nmatter that the figures in \"Jacob and Rachel\" are taken out of the early\r\npictures of Pinturicchio and Raphael, they are still interwoven, with\r\ntheir background of landscape, into an idyll of great naïveté and charm.\r\nMore especially, however, did the qualities which he owed to Dürer\r\nacquire value--a sturdy characterisation, a naïve art in telling the\r\nstory, and a great wealth of fresh traits, straight from nature--in the\r\nserial compositions of his old age. There is no sentimental vagueness,\r\nnothing academical. Führich had a keen eye for what was intimate,\r\nfamiliar; a tender sense of the individualities of landscape in woodland\r\nand meadow, of the charm of everyday life as well as of the animal\r\nworld; and though an idealist, he knew how to assimilate ingeniously\r\nwhat he had observed with a certain realistic fulness. The old story of\r\nBoaz and Ruth grew beneath his hands into a delicious idyll of country\r\nlife. From the story of the Prodigal Son he has extracted with\r\nsensitiveness the purely human kernel, and as late as the winter of\r\n1870-71, at the age of seventy-one, he illustrated the legend of St.\r\nGwendolen, in which he depicted with tender reverence the escape of a\r\nhuman soul, withdrawn from the world and resigned to God's will, into\r\nNature and her peace.\r\n\r\nEdward Steinle, who went from Rome to Vienna in 1833, and settled in\r\nFrankfort in 1838, is called, not very appropriately, by his biographer,\r\nConstantine Wuzbach, \"a Madonna painter of our time.\" His name deserves\r\nto come down to posterity rather for what he created outside the\r\nessential characteristics of his art. In his frescoes in the minster at\r\nAachen, in the choir of the cathedrals of Strasburg and Cologne, he\r\nstood firm on the standpoint of the Nazarenes; which is as much as to\r\nsay they contained nothing novel in the history of art. In his fairy\r\npictures, however, imagination broke through the narrow confines of\r\ndogma, and entwined itself in creative enjoyment round the vague figures\r\nof fable. His \"Loreley,\" in the Schack Gallery, as she looks down, a\r\nMedusa-like destroyer, from the tall cliff; his watchman who looks\r\ndreamily into space over the houses of the old town; his violin player\r\non his tower who plays, forgetful of the world,--these have something\r\nmusical, poetical, that freshness of sentiment and unsought naïveté\r\nwhich as an inheritance of his Viennese home was also peculiar in such a\r\nhigh degree to Schwind.\r\n\r\nThe Romantic aspiration is revealed in Steinle, even, in a certain\r\n\"yearning after colour.\" There lives in his works a refined feeling for\r\ncolour that, especially in his water-colours, rarely forsakes him.\r\nTake, for instance, the fresh, tinted pen-drawings, engraved by\r\nSchaffer, in which he displayed with the naïveté of Memlinc the life of\r\nSt. Euphrosyne; the five aquarelles of Grimm's \"Snow-White and\r\nRose-Red\"; or his illustrations to Brentano's poems, such as the\r\n_Chronicle of the Wandering Student_, and the _Fairy Tale of the Rhine\r\nand Radlauf the Miller_, in which he developed a delight in the world\r\nand an idea of landscape that in the ascetic Nazarene excite\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEIT.   THE TWO MARYS AT THE SEPULCHRE.]\r\n\r\nJulius Schnorr von Carolsfeld went, after the completion of the Ariosto\r\nRoom of the Villa Massini, first to Vienna, then in 1827 to Munich, in\r\norder to paint the _Nibelungen_ in the halls of the royal residence of\r\nthat time, and in the imperial halls of the state palace the history of\r\nCharlemagne, Frederick Barbarossa, and Rudolf of Hapsburg. He also,\r\nhowever, created his best work at the close of his life in Dresden,--the\r\nforcible woodcuts of his _Picture Bible_, which narrated the world's\r\nsacred history in strong and vigorous strokes.\r\n\r\nStrangest to the present-day taste have become the drawings of\r\nCornelius. His plates to Goethe's _Faust_ have, indeed, a certain\r\naustere strength of conception, which he learnt from Dürer; but also\r\nfaults of drawing, exaggerations, crudities, and errors in perspective,\r\nwhich he did not find in Dürer.\r\n\r\nIn his second work, the Nibelungen cycle, an intentional old-German\r\nangularity, with an unintentional modern clumsiness, has effected a\r\n_mésalliance_ even less attractive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OVERBECK.   PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF AND CORNELIUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF MUNICH UNDER KING LUDWIG I\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than seventeen hundred years ago there reigned a Roman emperor who\r\nloved art passionately. He looked upon it from an intellectual altitude\r\nwhich few have reached, and he valued it as the monumental consummation\r\nof Græco-Roman culture. Standing upon a plane of intellectual elevation,\r\nhimself gifted with artistic intuition, he knew of no higher enjoyment\r\nfor a ruler than the cultivation of the architectural and other forms of\r\nart. It was he who opened up to the energy of artists a field such as\r\nhas never been offered to them before or since. He spent upon his works\r\nsums incalculable, so that his people grew restless under their\r\nemperor's mania for building. His villa at Tivoli, which attained to the\r\nextent of a town, was in itself a copy of everything that he most loved\r\nand admired in the world. It united nearly all the renowned buildings of\r\nAthens in one masterly reproduction. And then with architecture came the\r\nother arts. The most magnificent collections of sculpture were formed,\r\nfor none had better opportunities of acquiring the antique masterpieces\r\nof the Greek towns. Numberless frescoes, scenes from those cities and\r\nregions which had most impressed him on his travels, adorned the walls.\r\n\r\nAnd yet subsequent generations have viewed with unconcern this halcyon\r\nperiod in the history of art. Though his contemporaries fancied that the\r\nsplendour of the Greek sun was still radiating over them, it was but a\r\nborrowed lustre, which never went beyond the reproduction or copying of\r\nclassic examples. Whatever Greek temples the emperor might build and\r\ndecorate, he failed to summon into being a Phidias or a Polygnotes to\r\nrevive for him the forms of the antique. The names of the artists who\r\nworked for him are forgotten. They had no originality; they copied the\r\ntypes of the Grecian and Egyptian periods, and their art was but a\r\nrepetition of old ideals, without character of age or place. The fifteen\r\ncolossal columns of his Olympieion that are still standing impress one\r\nas foreign to Athens, and would seem more in place at Baalbeck or\r\nPalmyra than in this city of the Muses. Epictetus would have smiled at\r\nthe emperor diverting himself with an album of the wonders of the world,\r\nas a piece of sentimentality. The age of Hadrian produced thousands of\r\nbuildings, statues, and pictures, but no original works.\r\n\r\nWill a different judgment be pronounced in the lapse of time upon the\r\nartistic creations of King Ludwig I? Ludwig also--his biography reads\r\nlike that of Hadrian--was an enthusiastic admirer of art. After the\r\nPeace of Vienna, when the political aspirations of Germany had been\r\nfrustrated, he alone among the numerous German princes of the old\r\nalliance fostered homeless art, and thus fulfilled a noble mission. The\r\nking's splendid enthusiasm for the ideal significance of art, which he\r\nhoped would lead the German people, then seeking to work out its\r\nindividuality, from out of its Philistine narrow-mindedness to nobler\r\nand greater things--this enthusiasm will redound to his enduring honour.\r\nSchiller's idea of educating humanity by æsthetic means had in him grown\r\ninto a living and powerful sentiment.\r\n\r\nAll that it was possible to accomplish in the cause of art, on the basis\r\nof existing development, his endeavours have fully realised. In the\r\ncourse of twenty-three years he spent more than £3,000,000 from his\r\nprivy purse, and made Munich what it is, the principal art centre of\r\nGermany; changed it from a Boeotia into an Athens; founded its art\r\ncollections, and erected the buildings which give the town its\r\ncharacter. Then he offered those new walls to the painter Cornelius, and\r\ncommanded him to cover them. \"You are my field-marshal, do you provide\r\ngenerals of division.\" In 1814 Cornelius had written to Bartholdy: \"The\r\nmost powerful and unfailing means to restore German art and bring it\r\ninto harmony with this great period and the spirit of the nation would\r\nbe a revival of fresco-painting as it existed in Italy from the days of\r\nthe great Giotto to those of the divine Raphael.\" And through this royal\r\ncommand the dream was realised beyond all expectation. No such lively\r\nartistic animation had been witnessed since the great periods of Italian\r\nart; an animation which does not cut the worst figure in German history\r\nin those sad times of political stagnation and reaction. But that there\r\nwas a living soul of art in those days posterity will no more\r\nacknowledge than it does in the case of the age of Hadrian.\r\n\r\n  \"Wie bei Bartholdy als Kind, so in Massimis Villa als Jüngling\r\n   Teutshes Fresco wir sehn, aber in München als Mann,\"\r\n\r\nsang King Ludwig. Now, after two generations, it can be seen that\r\nfresco-painting at Munich from 1820 to 1840 produced less original\r\nconceptions of the German art of the nineteenth than weak reflections of\r\nthe Italian art of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nVarious favourable circumstances combined at that time to cause\r\nCornelius to be specially looked upon by his contemporaries as an\r\nincomparable master. Since Tiepoli, German monumental art had remained\r\ndormant. The frescoes at Munich were the first attempts made to revive\r\nit. And it seemed as though with Cornelius, German art had at once risen\r\nto the dizzy heights to which Italian art had been led by Michael\r\nAngelo. The lookers-on believed in Buonarotti's resurrection. As in the\r\nSistine \"Last Judgment,\" the movement of his heroic figures appeared\r\nplastic and pathetic, and his types, not excepting the women, gave that\r\nimpression of the terrible, which none but Signorelli and Michael Angelo\r\nhad attained before him. His advent, it was said, might almost make one\r\nbelieve in a kind of metempsychosis; as though the spirit of the great\r\nFlorentine master, that giant of the Renaissance, had been restored to\r\nhumanity. At that very period the Italian art of the Cinquecento enjoyed\r\nthe exclusive favour of the German scholars. It alone was worthy of\r\nimitation; in it the æsthetic philosophers sought for rules and laws to\r\ngovern the development of art. And as they thought that all the\r\nqualities of this artistic method were to be found in the works of\r\nCornelius, it was only logical to arrive at the conclusion which the\r\nCrown Prince Ludwig summed up in the following words: \"There has been no\r\npainter like Cornelius since the Cinquecento.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETER CORNELIUS.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time the intellectual character of his work harmonised with\r\nthe wishes of a period in which the leaders of German thought tried to\r\nforget the dreary dulness of life by plunging into the most profound\r\nspeculations. \"What does it matter,\" writes Hallman, \"if we lack all\r\njoyous, independent national feeling? What though we do not even try to\r\nresuscitate this feeling with wars and battles? We strive after\r\nsomething higher! The world is beginning to respect German intellect and\r\nlearning. We believe that in this we are in advance of other nations,\r\nand we seek a mode of expression, we want to give a form to that lofty\r\nthought through our art, in order that we may bequeath to posterity an\r\nimage of our fortunate condition.... Therefore it is a remarkable sign\r\nof the times that painting strives to make the weighty output of\r\nintellectual thought a common treasure of all who are neither able nor\r\ndisposed to follow speculation to its dizzy heights, nor erudition to\r\nits lowest depths; that painters try to transform the results of those\r\ninvestigations into fresh and ever lively conceptions--the element of\r\nart.\"\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this none was better fitted than Cornelius. What a weight\r\nof thought and learning his works display!\r\n\r\nIn the Pinakothek, Cornelius' main idea was to paint the life and work\r\nof Nature as illuminated by the figures of the Greek gods. For the\r\nseries of paintings in the Hall of the Gods, Hesiod's _Theogony_ offered\r\na basis upon which to demonstrate the idea of the triumph of the\r\ncreative mind in heaven and upon earth. In the second room, human\r\npassion, power, and tyranny were illustrated in scenes of Greek heroic\r\nlife from the _Iliad_. The frescoes in the Ludwigskirche were to follow\r\nthe Christian apocalypse as a concatenation, and to depict it in\r\nsymbolic treatment from the Creation to the Last Judgment. The frescoes\r\nfor the Campo Santo at Berlin were meant to represent \"the universal and\r\nmost exalted fortunes of humanity, the manifestation of divine grace\r\ntowards the sins of mankind, the redemption from sin, perdition, and\r\ndeath, the triumph of life and eternity.\" Each of these paintings is a\r\ntreatise. Each fresco bears a definite relation to the other; deep\r\nphilosophic speculations weave their threads from one to the other. Or\r\nelse the painter revels in a suite of compositions which trace a network\r\nof intellectual combinations from one picture to the other. As he\r\nhimself expressed it, he delivered his diploma lecture through his\r\npaintings.\r\n\r\nAnd this painted erudition harmonised with the requirements of those\r\ntimes of dominating intellectual tendencies. The scholars saw in\r\nCornelius the poet, the doctor-in-philosophy; held that the principal\r\nvalue of the work of art lay in its intellectual contents, and felt that\r\ntheir loftiest mission was to express these contents still more\r\ncorrectly than the painter himself. The idea, they said, was the alpha\r\nand omega of the painter's art, and must be accepted at its full value,\r\neven when represented in the most shadowy external form.\r\n\r\nThese opinions have now vanished entirely. A more extended intercourse\r\nwith the old masters and with the art of other countries has gradually\r\ncured the Germans too of that mental hypertrophy from which they\r\nsuffered in their view of art--a complaint whose characteristic symptom\r\nwas the entire lack of sensuousness, of that sensibility to beauty of\r\nform and external charm which always has been and always must be the\r\npredominating mood of a society in which art is to flourish. They have\r\ngradually reached the point at which one interests one's self in a\r\npicture for the sake of the painting of it, looks first at the picture,\r\nand only then asks what the painter's idea may have been, or what the\r\nspectator is to gather from it. No poem will find favour which offers\r\nacceptable thoughts in badly worded, halting, unmelodious verse; nor do\r\nthe loftiest thoughts in themselves suffice to make a work of art.\r\nProfundity of thought is a thing that has little to do with pure art;\r\nand the subject alone, however world-stirring the ideas in it may be,\r\nnever makes a thing artistic. We have learnt to find the most intense\r\nenjoyment in the mere contemplation of Titian's \"Earthly and Heavenly\r\nLove,\" although we may not yet know what this picture is really meant to\r\nconvey. And we know none the less that what renders Raphael's \"School of\r\nAthens\" immortal is not its catalogue of ideas, which has been drawn up\r\nby an anonymous pedant, but the master's artistic power, the intensity\r\nwith which he expresses what was barely showing bud in the material, the\r\nself-reliant strength and sureness with which the form and colour have\r\nsucceeded in outlining and creating every figure and every movement in\r\nthe picture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETER CORNELIUS.   'LET THERE BE LIGHT'.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORNELIUS.   FROM THE FRESCOES IN THE FRIEDHOFSHALLE,\r\n  BERLIN.]\r\n\r\nNo less has the comparative study of art gradually refined people's\r\nsensibility to originality. We are no longer compelled to place an\r\nartist on the same level with a master of ancient art because of the\r\nouter resemblance of their work. We have progressed so far as to respect\r\nin art none but original genius, and to look upon imitation as a\r\n_testimonium paupertatis_ though Praxiteles or Michael Angelo be the\r\nmodel. In this we find the explanation of the low esteem in which some\r\nof the old masters are now held. The contemporaries of Mabuse and Marten\r\nHeemskerk thought that in these painters they had found again the great\r\nprimeval, Titanic nature of Michael Angelo, his vast motives and\r\nmajestic forms. To-day we say of them, and with justice, that they\r\nproduced nothing better than caricatures of Michael Angelo, that they\r\nexpressed themselves in shallow phrases, that their religious pictures\r\nare cold and inflated, and that their mythological presentations with\r\nnaked figures impress us as bombastic and repellent. Houbraken, in his\r\nbiography of Gérard de Lairesse, wrote: \"A whole book could be filled\r\nwith the description of his innumerable pictures and panels, ceilings\r\nand frescoes.\" To-day we dismiss this unattractive mannerist in a few\r\nlines. What his contemporaries described as his Michaelangelesque and\r\nmajestic fierceness appears to us, looking back, as a mere pale\r\nimitation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORNELIUS.   MARGUERITE IN PRISON.]\r\n\r\nMeasure Cornelius by the same rule, and the result is no less\r\nmelancholy. Merciless history paused for a moment to consider whether it\r\never saw his equal, and then passed on to the order of the day, as it\r\ndid with his predecessors. To us he is no longer the original genius\r\nthat he was to his contemporaries, but an imitator. The retrospective\r\nhistory of art marks a new epoch with him, Heinrich Hess, and Schnorr:\r\nthe advance from the paths of the early Italians, trodden by the\r\nNazarenes, to this link with the golden age of the Cinquecento. The\r\nworks of Cornelius are mighty shadows cast into our days by the gigantic\r\nfigures of Michael Angelo. But only shadows! There is no blood in them.\r\nA direct line leads from Michael Angelo to Millet; but I doubt whether\r\nthe master would delight in Cornelius, who has only used him as a\r\n_gradus ad Parnassum_. The works of Cornelius are the products of a\r\ncivilised yet artistically poor period. The idealism of Michael Angelo\r\nhad raised itself upon the naturalistic shoulders of Donatello and\r\nGhirlandaio; this new Cornelian idealism sprang into being full-grown\r\nfrom reminiscences, and was therefore from the outset without backbone.\r\nIt is the fruit of a decadence, not the mature product of a full-blown\r\nart, which has taken centuries to grow and ripen. In Michael Angelo the\r\naspirations of Italian art, from Giotto onward, attained their zenith.\r\nCornelius, standing solitary in an inartistic period that had lost every\r\ntradition and all technical method, believed in the possibility of\r\nrising to the same level by making the forms borrowed from Michael\r\nAngelo convey scraps of modern knowledge. In doing this he could not but\r\nconfirm the experience, thus described by Goethe in his _Theory of\r\nColour_: \"Even the most perfect models are delusive, by causing us to\r\npass over necessary decrees of culture, and thus generally carrying us\r\nbeyond the goal into a domain of boundless error.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORNELIUS.   THE APOCALYPTIC HOST.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time that Heinrich Hess was carrying on his calligraphic\r\nexercises after Raphael and Andrea del Sarto in the Basilika at Munich,\r\nCornelius was making his schoolboy sketches after Michael Angelo. What\r\nis great in his master is empty _pose_ in him; what is _furia_ in the\r\nformer is a laboured imitation in the latter. While the terrific\r\nFlorentine Master found within himself the expression of his superhuman\r\nfigures, his learned follower copies attitudes, gestures,\r\ngroups--familiar to anyone who has been to Italy and passed a few hours\r\nin the Sistine Chapel. One seems to hear the old Florentine's great\r\nvoice toned down through the telephone, and irritating us with false\r\npathos at moments when pathos is quite superfluous. All the faces are\r\ndistorted with grimaces, heads of hair are puffed up as though with\r\nserpents, garments fly about; people shout instead of speaking, open\r\ntheir mouths wide as though they were giving the word of command to an\r\narmy, stretch out their arms as though they would embrace the world. A\r\nmother bearing a child in her arms squeezes it to death. A cook\r\nroasting a leg of mutton bastes it with a Herculean gesture, and a\r\nbutler emptying a leather bottle has the air of a river-god meditating a\r\nflood. In order that his human beings may look vigorous and heroic, he\r\nmakes them walk in seven-league boots, dislocate their limbs, expand the\r\ngigantic measurement of the body far beyond the human. Every head shows\r\na different colouring: one red as sealing-wax, another rose-pink, a\r\nthird _caput mortuum_. Added to this, the academic drapery arrangements,\r\nthose florid garments with their rolling, writhing folds, for which\r\nthere is no real justification, and which have no use but that of\r\nornament. \"Ah,\" says Goethe, in one of his letters, \"how true it is that\r\nnothing is remarkable but what is natural: nothing grand but what is\r\nnatural: nothing beautiful, nothing, etc., etc., but what is natural.\"\r\nMichael Angelo is not at all easy to understand; and Cornelius' study of\r\nhim resulted in the very same mannerism into which the Dutchmen had\r\nfallen three hundred years earlier,--the only difference being that he\r\nsurpassed them in erudition. But although this quality would no doubt\r\nhave greatly helped him had he written books, we cannot take it into\r\naccount in discussing his artistic merits, any more than we can judge\r\nGérard de Lairesse by his literary achievements. Nay, more, as he had\r\nelected to confine himself to painting, his erudition became a curse to\r\nhim, bringing him to disregard beauty of form in a manner as yet unknown\r\nin the history of art. Not only was he filled with ardour for the\r\nloftier thoughts, without allowing any other forms for their\r\npresentation but those which were mere reminiscences of former art\r\nperiods--he did not even give himself leisure thoroughly to assimilate\r\nthe forms borrowed from Michael Angelo, and to animate them with fresh\r\nlife. Hence the fact that, as an artist, he remains greatly below the\r\nlevel of the Dutch copyists, in whose work there is at least no faulty\r\ndrawing and tasteless colouring to be found. He asked for walls, not as\r\npanels to paint on, but as tablets on which to inscribe his thoughts;\r\nfelt exclusively as a poet, a man of learning, brooding ideas. Engrossed\r\nin developing these ideas, he valued form and colour no more than an\r\nauthor would the embellishing of his manuscript with flowing letters and\r\nan artistic arrangement of inks. It is only by this means that we can\r\nexplain the unjustifiable carelessness with which he surrendered his\r\ncartoons to his pupils, and allowed them a free hand in the carrying\r\nthem out, or account for the evanescent colouring in the Glyptothek and\r\nin the Ludwigskirche,--a colouring which was even at that time far below\r\nthe general level, and which could only be excused in the case of a\r\nself-trained and quite untutored school.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  CORNELIUS.   THE FALL OF TROY.]\r\n\r\nA man of this kind, who had nothing to teach that was worth the\r\nlearning, and who excelled only in intellectual qualities which could\r\nnot be imparted to others, must needs prove the most dangerous\r\nacademy-principal Germany has had since she first boasted an academy. So\r\nmuch the more as his pupils readily submitted to the personal\r\nfascination of this earnest little man with his black clothes, his\r\npompous appearance, his flashing eagle eye, which made one believe\r\nthat, Dante-like, he had looked upon heaven and hell. \"As there are men\r\nborn to command an army, so Cornelius was born to be the head of a\r\nschool of painting,\" said King Ludwig. We can scarcely help smiling at\r\nSchwind's account of the trembling awe with which, upon his arrival from\r\nVienna, he presented himself to the master. The red-haired stripling, in\r\nhis outgrown clothes, timidly strolling round the rooms of the\r\nGlyptothek suddenly sees Cornelius himself, high on a scaffolding, in\r\nall his glory, in an effulgence such as surrounds the head of Phoebus\r\nApollo. Accustomed to seeing young artists stoop before him, now\r\nstammering, now paling, now blushing, the demi-god descends to the level\r\nof the unknown mortal. \"He is quite a little man, in a blue shirt, with\r\na red belt. He looks very stern and distinguished, and his black,\r\ngleaming eyes impress you. He descended from his throne, changed his\r\nblue smock for an elegant frockcoat, drank a glass of water with an easy\r\nmanner, and made my flesh thrill with a short explanation of what had\r\nbeen painted and what was still to be done, tucked a few writing books\r\nunder his arm, and went upon his business to the academy.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILHELM KAULBACH.]\r\n\r\nThe reformation of the academy, instigated by him at Munich,\r\ndemonstrated the one-sidedness of his point of view. He turned it into a\r\nschool for fresco-painting. \"A professorship in _genre_ and landscape\r\npainting appears to me superfluous,\" he wrote to the king in 1825; \"true\r\nart knows no subdivision.\" But as he himself had only partially mastered\r\nfresco painting, he did not even succeed in establishing a school of\r\nfresco painters. It was only one of designers of cartoons.\r\n\r\n\"Read the great poets: Homer, Shakespeare, Goethe; do not forget to\r\ninclude the Bible. The brush has become the ruin of our art. It has led\r\nfrom Nature to Mannerism.\" By means of this teaching Cornelius infused\r\nall his own defects into his academy, which for that reason was doomed\r\nfrom the outset to an early decease. A war of extermination, often\r\nleading to the most burlesque scenes, was declared by the Cornelians\r\nagainst the Langerians, who were despised because they had retained a\r\nfew of the technical acquirements of the peruke period. When Cornelius's\r\nattention was drawn to the fact that in one of his cartoons he had given\r\na Greek hero six fingers he answered with indifference: \"Ay, and if he\r\nhad had seven, how would it affect the general idea?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KAULBACH.   THE DELUGE.]\r\n\r\nIt was only natural, therefore, that his pupils should feel above using\r\na model. It is said that at the time when they were turning Munich into\r\nan Athens, and the painters were covering the city walls with frescoes,\r\nMunich possessed but one model, and the poor fellow died of starvation.\r\nAnd then, how they hated colours! They were so difficult to manage! Who,\r\npray, wanted to learn fresco painting by hard labour, and swallow the\r\nchalk-dust? It was much easier to copy their lord and master, whose name\r\nwas on their lips, but not a spark of whose genius was in their heads,\r\nwith every sort of mannerism. \"When nature once produces a new birth she\r\ndoes so with a lavish hand. Talents, talents enough for centuries!\" In\r\nthese words Cornelius himself did honour to his pupils--to Carl\r\nHerrmann, Strähuber, Hermann Anschütz, Hiltensperger, and Lindenschmit\r\nthe elder, the mention of whose names evokes a painful memory of the\r\narcades in the palace garden at Munich.\r\n\r\nWhat survives of Cornelius is only the man, the individual. Posterity\r\nwill doubtless always honour him for the unflinching energy with which\r\nhe upheld his ideal from youth to failing age; for his courage in\r\npropounding and defending what seemed right to _him_; for refraining\r\nfrom putting on velvet gloves with the multitude, but frankly showing\r\nthem his nails. This high-mindedness of Cornelius, and his lofty\r\nconception of the aims of art, must always command our respect. All his\r\nworks are the product of a serene, great, and noble soul. His is a\r\nphysiognomy with a proud, vigorous profile, which expresses an\r\nintellectual tendency, and can never be forgotten. He was a man--as a\r\npainter, a curse to German art, but a self-conscious, aristocratic mind.\r\nAs he himself said: \"Art has its high-priests and also its\r\nhedge-priests\"; and when at the end of his life he made his profession:\r\n\"Never, under any circumstance of my life, have I lost my pious\r\nreverence for the divinity of art; never have I sinned against it,\" we\r\nnone of us refuse to accept his word.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KAULBACH.   PRINCE ARTHUR AND HUBERT.]\r\n\r\nThis unfailing earnestness which suffuses Cornelius's work raises him\r\nhigh above _Wilhelm Kaulbach_, and secures for him lasting fame, when\r\nthat of Kaulbach shall have been buried with the last of the \"cultured\"\r\npatrons for whom he worked, and by whom he was placed on a pedestal.\r\nLook at both of them from a purely artistic point of view, comparing\r\nthem with the old masters, and both of them sink equally into\r\ninsignificance. But if we come to accept the problem of art criticism as\r\na matter of psychology rather than of æsthetics, if we search for the\r\nrelations between the work of art and the soul of its author, we cannot\r\nbut look upon Kaulbach as by far the inferior. Cornelius endeavoured to\r\nraise the masses to his level, paid for his idealism with unpopularity,\r\nand was never understood. Kaulbach, the humble servant of the public,\r\nchanged the Spartan iron of the art of Cornelius for the base coin of\r\nthe art unions; to tickle the multitude, he clothed voluptuous\r\nsensuality in the stately garment of the earnest Muse, and was hailed\r\nwith jubilation throughout his life. But the valise with which alone,\r\naccording to the fairy-tale, one can enter upon the journey to\r\nimmortality, was still lighter in his case. Idealistic painting, as\r\nprofessed by Cornelius, had skimmed all the cream from religious and\r\nmythological subjects; so Kaulbach tried to give something more actual\r\nin its stead. He found this in the philosophy of history, in the images\r\nof epochs in the history of the world which were then so much in vogue,\r\nand handed his public, eager for knowledge, a printed programme upon\r\nwhich he had catalogued the gigantic thoughts and even weightier\r\nreferences which the picture was said to contain. As the masses were\r\nawed by the severity of the Cornelian conception of forms, he softened\r\nit down with superficial calligraphic elegance: what was sturdy and\r\nangular in the former was by him changed into a coquettish effeminacy.\r\nThis he effected by daubing his pictures, which were in no way colour\r\nconceptions, with insipid combinations of colour, and replaced with\r\noleographs Cornelius's illuminated monumental woodcuts. By these\r\nconcessions to the picturesque he drove the axe into the tree which the\r\ndesigners of cartoons had planted. The part he plays is that of a man of\r\ncompromise between Cornelius and Piloty; his frescoes are too sugary;\r\nhis oil-paintings too faulty. It was he who buried the era of cartoons,\r\nalthough the obsequies were conducted with all pomp.\r\n\r\nA spiritual battle, an aerial battle, the \"Battle of the Huns,\" is the\r\nfirst of his works. Beneath, a real historical event; above, the same\r\nreproduced in the spiritual world. The battle is over; the field is\r\nhidden beneath the corpses of the slain; but the spirits continue the\r\ncombat in mid-air, and strive to turn the occasion to account for a\r\ndisplay of nudity. Next came the \"Destruction of Jerusalem,\" crammed\r\nwith ingenious references, and elucidated with long, printed\r\ncommentaries. This programme-painting played its trump card on the\r\nstaircase of the Berlin Museum, where a space of 240 feet by 28 feet is\r\noccupied by \"the intellectual manifestations of the historical\r\n_Weltgeist_\"; \"the total evolution of culture with every people of every\r\nperiod in its principal historical phases\"; those incidents \"which, in\r\nthe evolution of universal history, mark the important knots with which\r\nthe closely entwined threads of the national dramas of the universe are\r\nbound together.\" The \"Battle of the Huns,\" the \"Destruction of\r\nJerusalem,\" were included in the series; and to them were added the\r\n\"Tower of Babel,\" the \"Rise of Greece,\" the \"Crusades,\" and the\r\n\"Reformation.\" The whole of Hegel's philosophy was reproduced on the\r\nwalls. But as the pictures are not new through any novelty or greatness\r\nof their conception, we need certainly not enter into the \"astounding\r\nprofundity\" of their philosophy. The eye is struck with mere\r\ncompositions, built up according to certain formulas, and _tableaux\r\nvivants_, put together with more or less cleverness, theatrical in\r\neffect and crude in colour.\r\n\r\nOf his other large pictures, the \"Naval Battle at Salamis\" caused a\r\nspecial stir through its sinking harem. In his \"Nero\" he contrasted the\r\norgies of the Romans of the decadence with the enthusiasm for death of\r\nthe early Christians. Again, in his great cartoon in charcoal of \"Peter\r\nArbue,\" he inflated to monumental dimensions a drawing suitable for a\r\ncomic paper.\r\n\r\nKaulbach is not an artist to be taken seriously. Woltmann, who made the\r\nsame observation twenty years ago, tried at least to vindicate the\r\nillustrator, and expressed his regret that a man who had the stuff in\r\nhim of a German Hogarth should unfortunately have been caught in the\r\ntoils of the Cornelian school. But this comparison does little justice\r\nto Hogarth. There is nothing in the illustrations of Kaulbach which many\r\nother artists could not have improved upon. In his \"Reynard the Fox\" he\r\nadapted, for the benefit of the German public, Grandville's _Scènes de\r\nla Vie privée et publique des Animaux_, published in 1842. His\r\nillustrations for _éditions de luxe_ (\"The Women of Goethe,\" etc.)\r\nmarked the first steps of the road which ended in Thuman. And Thuman\r\nstands higher than Kaulbach. The faint, unaccented drawing, the oval\r\n\"beauty\" of heads, declamatory and expressionless, the academic touch\r\nare common to both of them. But only with Kaulbach do we find the\r\npenetrating perfume of the demi-monde, the voluptuous, satirical\r\nlaughter which is not even stilled before Goethe, the pandering\r\nsensuality which cannot touch the purest and tenderest figures in German\r\npoetry without using them as a pretext to fling nudities to the public\r\nlike bones to a dog. In his \"Dance of Death\" suite, Kaulbach turned into\r\nfrivolity what Rethel had before expressed solemnly and earnestly. Like\r\nthe two augurs, who could not meet without laughing, so at last the\r\nsatirical designer began to laugh at his own monumental pictures. After\r\ncompleting in his series of mural paintings at the Berlin Museum his\r\n\"Apotheosis of the Evolution of Human Culture,\" he explained in his\r\nfriezes that the whole was, after all, nothing but a dustbin and a\r\nlumber-room. When he was commissioned to depict a suite of paintings for\r\nthe upper walls of the new Pinakothek at Munich, the artistic life of\r\nthat town, as glorified by King Ludwig--a suite which the weather has\r\nsince been kind enough to render almost invisible--he fulfilled his task\r\nby mocking at what he should have glorified.\r\n\r\n  \"All die Meister Kunstbahnbrecher, wie die Herren selbst sich nennen,\r\n   Wahrlich Widderköpfe sind sie, Mauern damit einzurennen.\r\n   Mit dem Loche in der Mauer ist's noch lange nicht geschehen,\r\n   Da muss erst der Held erscheinen, siegreich dadurch einzugehen.\r\n   Gegen jenes Ungeheuer ziehen sie zu Feld mit Phrasen,\r\n   Wie die sieben Schwaben einstmals ritterlich bekämpft den Hasen.\r\n   Voran zieht der edle Ritter Schnorr, der Künste Don Quixote,\r\n   Seine Rosinante setzt er, statt des Pegasus in Trotte;\r\n   Heiliger Hess, sein Sancho Pansa, Du nicht liebst das offene Streiten,\r\n   Und du lässt dich sachte, sachte, 'rab von Deinem Esel gleiten.\r\n   Was ist denn so grosses Neues in der Neuen Kunst geschehen?\r\n   Nichts, als was sie nicht der aften, längst vergangnen abgesehen.\r\n   Wände ich auch Lorbeerkränze all um diese Alltagsfratzen,\r\n   Würden sie sie doch nur zieren zu bedecken hohle Glatzen.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the commentary written by Kaulbach himself; and Théophile\r\nGautier called the suite _un carnaval au soleil_. \"The king in his youth\r\nspent millions in order to elevate art,\" says Schwind; \"and now in his\r\nold age he pays another thousand pounds in order to be laughed at for\r\nit.\" Heine's loud, scornful laughter resounds over the grave of romantic\r\nliterature; and so the \"monumental period of German art\" ends in\r\nself-derision.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as the mural paintings of the new Pinakothek, like the\r\nfrescoes in the Arcades and most of the other monumental products of the\r\nperiod, are falling into ruin, and only show traces of their past beauty\r\nin a few faint spots of colour not yet entirely effaced, it is quite\r\nclear that it was an inherent fallacy of Cornelius to expect a\r\n_renovation_ of national German art from fresco painting. The Venetians\r\nof the sixteenth century well knew why they did not take up fresco\r\npainting. Monumental painting, as aimed at by Cornelius, must remain an\r\nimported plant that cannot possibly thrive in a northern climate; and\r\noil-painting, since the Van Eycks the medium and basis of art-culture\r\namong the Teutonic races, took its revenge upon his one-sidedness and\r\nhis Michaelangelesque disdain, in the fact that at Munich it had to be\r\nlearnt again right from the beginning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KAULBACH.   MARGUERITE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE DÜSSELDORFERS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Rhine there existed a school of painting instead of a school of\r\ndrawing, a fact which at that time placed Düsseldorf next in importance\r\nto Munich. Wilhelm Schadow, its first director, was lacking in any\r\npersonal distinction as an artist, but he had received from his great\r\nfather a tendency towards perfection of technique, which brought him and\r\nhis school into direct opposition with the purely philosophical painters\r\nof the severe Cornelian tradition, and which has even in our days been\r\nable to exercise an authoritative influence. In Rome he was the only one\r\nof the Nazarenes amenable to the French influence, while the others\r\nnervously held aloof from the members of the French Academy. And this\r\nformal bent of his talent later gave him the qualifications of a sound\r\nteacher. Immediately upon his arrival at Düsseldorf, in November 1826,\r\nhe was escorted by a stately throng of students: Carl Friedrich Lessing,\r\nJulius Hübner, Theodor Hildebrandt, Carl Sohn, H. Mücke, and Christian\r\nKoehler, who were afterwards joined by Eduard Bendemann, Ernest Deger,\r\nand others. These became the mainstay of the celebrated Old Düsseldorf\r\nSchool, which was soon supported by the jubilant enthusiasm of its\r\ncontemporaries. At the Berlin exhibitions the new school of painting\r\npassed from one triumph to the other. Young men fresh from school\r\nsuddenly made names that were honoured throughout Germany, by reason of\r\nthe remarkable manner in which their works succeeded in expressing the\r\nsentimental romanticism of the time.\r\n\r\nThe Wars of Liberty of 1813, which had caused a gust of joyous\r\nenthusiasm to penetrate even into the peaceful seclusion of the\r\nNazarenes, were not, like the wars of 1870, the outcome of careful\r\ncalculation, but the result of a sudden burst of ardour, and the\r\ndisillusion had now followed upon the enthusiasm. In 1810, with the\r\nFrench bayonets gleaming outside the windows, and the French kettledrums\r\ndrowning the sound of his voice, Fichte delivered at the Berlin\r\nUniversity his famous speeches which sounded the réveillé for Germany.\r\nAt the same time Kleist wrote his _Hermannschlacht_: Napoleon was to be\r\ntreated as Hermann had treated Varus. \"_Was blasen die Trompeten,\r\nHusaren heraus_,\" pealed through the air; the song of \"_Got, der Eisen\r\nwachsen liess_\" rose heavenwards in brazen accords. And not long after,\r\nthe same lions who had beaten the Corsican at Leipzig, and had with\r\nArndt conceived the idea of a great, united fatherland, had once more\r\nbecome the same easy-going people, drinking their beer and smoking their\r\npipes in their little duodecimo principalities as of old. Those dreary\r\ntimes, which saw no prospect of relief in their own days, must needs\r\nnourish a devotion to the past. That haughty antiquity, which had been\r\npossessed of the ideal to which the present had not been able to attain,\r\nbecame the object of a fanatical adoration. Men lost themselves in the\r\nold storehouses of faded German reminiscences, and fled for inspiration\r\nto the times of a consolidated German Empire. This return to the ruins\r\nof the past was a protest against the grey, colourless present. The\r\npatriotic frenzy of the poets of freedom changed into enthusiasm for the\r\nvanished glories of mediæval Germany. They remembered with longing and\r\nyearning the days when the robber-knights ruled town and country from\r\ntheir strongholds. Schenkendorff sang hymns inspired by the old\r\ncathedrals, rummaged with holy horror among the skeletons of knights and\r\nheroes in the chapel, and wrote a poem in memory of the thousandth\r\nanniversary of the death of Charlemagne; Arndt, the bard of the wars of\r\nfreedom, violently attacked the \"industrialism\" of the time, declaiming\r\nagainst steam and machinery; Zacharias Werner composed his poem, \"_Das\r\nFeldgeschrei sei: alte Zeit wird neu_.\"\r\n\r\nThis revival of romanticism opened up a wide field to science and\r\npoetry. The apotheosis of the old imperial times was made manifest amid\r\nfairy-like glamour. Poetry grasped the pilgrim's staff, or rode with\r\nbeauteous dames on milk-white palfreys through forest and glade.\r\nEnchanted genii, elves, fairies, and goblins were encountered on the\r\nroad. Nowhere is there so sweet a scent of blossoms, so innocent a sound\r\nof children's merriment, as in Tieck's delightful and dainty\r\nfairy-tales, or in the works of Clemens Brentano, those precious stories\r\nof Father Rhine, of the water-nymphs and the crystal castles at the\r\nbottom of the green current, pictures full of charming wilfulness,\r\ndreamily winsome, like summer evenings on the Rhine. Uhland sang, as\r\nonce had sung the knightly poets with the golden harps--\r\n\r\n  \"Von Gottesminne, von kühner Helden Muth,\r\n   Von lindem liebesinne, von süsser Maiengluth.\"\r\n\r\nTo this day we seem to peep between the weather-beaten castles, standing\r\non their grey rocks along the Rhine Valley, into the realm of romance as\r\ninto an enigma propounded by mountain and dale. Rhine and romance!\r\n\r\nNo spot in Germany was better fitted to become the cradle of a romantic\r\nart than Düsseldorf, the peaceful town on the legend-haunted banks of\r\nthe green river. In the fifteenth century, in addition to the school of\r\nFlorence, where flowed a rich current of political and human life, where\r\ngreat buildings, monuments, and frescoes kept architects and sculptors\r\nand painters uniformly busied, there existed in the remote Umbrian\r\nvalleys, in the land of miracles and visions, that school of painting in\r\noils which saw its only eternal ideal in the deep eyes and soft aspect\r\nof the Madonna, and made the visionary aspirations of the soul,\r\nemotions, and sentiment the exclusive subject of their pictures. In the\r\nsame manner, in the nineteenth century, we find in contrast with the\r\nMunich school, with its numerous architectural products, its massive\r\nstatuary, and the epic-dramatic fresco painting of Cornelius--\"wedding\r\nthe German to the Greek, and Faust to Helen\"--that lyrico-sentimental\r\nDüsseldorf school of painting which embraced Madonnas and prophets,\r\nknights and robbers, gipsies and monks, water-nymphs and nuns with the\r\nsame languishing tenderness. In matter and technique it completes the\r\nart of Cornelius and the Nazarenes; that of the Munich master by its\r\nencouragement of oil-painting; that of the Nazarenes by the stress which\r\nit lays upon the more worldly side of mediæval life, upon chivalry, and\r\nin a less degree upon that other pillar of mediævalism the Church. The\r\nNazarenes are archæological and ascetic; the Düsseldorf school is\r\ninsipid in a modern way, feeble, colourless, and sentimental.\r\n\r\nCount Raczynski and Friedrich von Uechtritz have given us interesting\r\ndescriptions of life at Düsseldorf at that time, and their story reads\r\nlike a chapter of Tacitus' _Germania_. \"_Grand dieu! Bons et affectueux\r\nallemands!_\" exclaimed a Parisian critic of the Count's book in sad\r\nemotion, and held up this virtuous German life, as an example worthy of\r\nimitation, to his compatriots, the decadents of fashionable artistic\r\nParis, fallen into modern luxury. Undisturbed by the hum of a big city,\r\nand without any communication with its surroundings, the Düsseldorf\r\ncolony of artists lived its life of seclusion. The painters saw none but\r\npainters. They herded together in the studios, and the sole recreation\r\nin the intervals of their work was a visit to another studio. The whole\r\nof the day was devoted to painting; when the picture was complete it\r\nwent to the art union; and the hours of tediousness were overcome with\r\nthe assistance of a little intrigue. Hildebrandt possessed the nucleus\r\nof a collection of beetles. Lessing, the hunter, collected pipes and\r\nantlers, and only felt himself at home in the little room which he\r\noccupied with Sohn when it assumed the appearance of a gamekeeper's\r\ncottage. Convinced that politics were the ruin of character, they\r\nallowed no questions of the day to interfere with the calmness of their\r\nartistic life. Few of them ever read a newspaper. In the year of\r\nrevolution, 1830, their sole interest in the events around them was\r\nconcentrated in the fear that a war might disturb their idyllic life.\r\nThe end of the day's work saw them in summer-time bent on a pilgrimage\r\nto the Stockkämpchen, to refresh themselves with a cup of buttermilk, to\r\nplay at bowls, or to enjoy a race among the cabbage patches of the\r\ngarden. In winter they made a point of meeting at seven o'clock every\r\nSaturday night at the inn for a literary reading. Each taking his part\r\nthey recited the dramas of Tieck, of Calderon, and Lopez; or Uechtritz\r\nread extracts from German history, the Crusades, the period of the\r\nemperors, the riots of the Hussites. Every Sunday night there met at\r\nSchadow's a very distinguished intellectual circle, consisting of Judge\r\nImmermann (the reformer of the stage at Düsseldorf), Felix Mendelssohn\r\nthe composer, Kortum, author of the _Jobsiade_, and Assessor von\r\nUechtritz, with their ladies. But the great gala-days were the\r\ntheatrical performances which took place twice a week. Under the\r\nleadership of Immermann the theatre had become the place whence the\r\nyoung painters gathered their liveliest suggestions. Some of them went\r\neven so far as to take part in amateur performances, conducted by\r\nImmermann, and given in Schadow's house, under the auspices of the whole\r\nof the distinguished society. And thus the pictures of this school were\r\nnot conceived under the influence of life, but of the theatre. The\r\nDüsseldorf artists were youths whose productions were not rooted in\r\nlife, but in reading and culture; youths who always moved in good\r\nsociety, and who had passed through the great ordeals of life, but only\r\non \"the boards representing the universe.\"\r\n\r\n_Theodor Hildebrandt_ became the Shakespeare of Düsseldorf. The\r\ntranslation of the works of the English poet by Schlegel had been\r\npublished some time earlier, and Immermann, in Düsseldorf, had been the\r\nfirst to offer Shakespeare a home on the German stage. The performances\r\nof his tragedies were regarded as red-letter days. During the three\r\nyears of Immermann's leadership (1834-37), _Hamlet_, _Macbeth_, _King\r\nJohn_, _King Lear_, _The Merchant of Venice_, _Romeo and Juliet_,\r\n_Othello_, and _Julius Cæsar_ were performed on fifteen occasions in\r\nall.[1] To give the titles of these plays is at once to characterise the\r\nsubject-matter of Hildebrandt's paintings. He very often had a hand in\r\nthe staging of the plays, and is said to have shown a remarkable\r\nhistrionic talent in the performances at Schadow's. He rarely went to\r\nother poets for his inspiration, as in his \"Pictures from Faust\" and his\r\n\"Beware of the Water Nymph,\" where he honoured Goethe, and in his\r\n\"Brigands,\" where he may have been inspired by one of the many\r\nvariations on _Rinaldo Rinaldini_ that flooded the market at the time,\r\nor perhaps also by Byron, whose influence was very marked on the\r\nDüsseldorf school.\r\n\r\nGoethe's _Frauengestalten_, more especially the Leonoras, were\r\nreproduced in oils by old father _Sohn_. _Eduard Steinbruck_ painted\r\nGenevièves, Red Riding Hoods, Elves, and Undines, after Tieck and\r\nFouqué; _H. Stilke's_ \"Pictures from the Crusades\" introduced Walter\r\nScott to the German public. Uhland's first ballads had brought into\r\nfashion the damsels who from the ramparts of their castles wave a sad\r\nfarewell to the lonely shepherds; the ancestral tombs, in which the last\r\nknight of his race takes his everlasting rest; the lists, where\r\nmelancholy heroes stab themselves. His _Love-song of the Shepherd to the\r\nShepherdess_--\r\n\r\n  \"Und halt ich dich in den Armen\r\n   Auf freien Bergeshöhn,\r\n   Wir sehn in die weiten Lande\r\n   Und werden doch nicht gesehn,\"\r\n\r\ngave Bendemann the motive for his picture of the same name. Young\r\nLessing had to thank Uhland for the subject of his first success, \"The\r\nSorrowing Royal Pair,\" which at one bound made his name one of the most\r\nhonoured in German art.\r\n\r\n  \"Wohl sah ich die Eltern beide\r\n   Ohne der Kronen Licht\r\n   Im schwarzen Trauerkleide,\r\n   Die Jungfrau sah ich nicht.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Bürger he painted a Leonora--of course in so-called mediæval\r\ncostume, in order \"to avoid the unpicturesque attire in fashion during\r\nthe Seven Years' War\"; and at the same time as Hildebrandt, \"A Mourning\r\nBrigand,\" who, in the full light of the evening sun, sits brooding on a\r\nrock over the depravity of the world. That all of them were frantically\r\nenthusiastic for the Hohenstaufens is due to the publication of Von\r\nRainer's History in 1823, which took a greater hold of the public than\r\ndid Schiller's _History of the Thirty Years' War_, and inspired numerous\r\ndramas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HILDEBRANDT.   THE SONS OF EDWARD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEINBRUCK.   ELVES.]\r\n\r\nEven the idyllic and touching scenes from the Old Testament and the\r\nHebrew elegies are easily traced back to theatrical inspirations. With\r\nthe exception of the frescoes of the Casa Bartholdy, the subjects of\r\nwhich were selected with an eye to the religious belief of their\r\npurchaser, the Nazarenes found all the subject-matter they wanted in the\r\nNew Testament. The Passion of Our Lord was unable to inspire the\r\nDüsseldorf school. As compared to the few Christian paintings by W.\r\nSchadow, and the dreamy Madonnas of Deger, Ittenbach, and little\r\nPerugino Mintrop, we find a far greater number of scenes from the Old\r\nTestament, which at the time gave birth to numerous dramas. Hübner,\r\nalways inclined to idyllic and melancholy scenes, painted Ruth and Boaz,\r\nhis first great picture, which established his reputation. After\r\nKlingemann had utilised the whole life of Moses by turning it into a\r\ntheatrically effective sequence, Christian Koehler scored a success with\r\nhis \"Moses hidden in the Bulrushes\" and his \"Finding of Moses,\" and\r\nthen, incited by Raupach's \"Semiramis,\" abandoned his biblical heroines\r\nfor Oriental ones. Theodor Hildebrandt took Tieck's \"Judith\" as an\r\ninspiration for his picture of this Jewish heroine. Kehren's \"Joseph\r\nreveals Himself to his Brethren\" was begun after the opera _Joseph in\r\nEgypt_ had been performed at Düsseldorf. Bendemann, in 1832, played his\r\ntrump card with his \"Lament of the Jews,\" now in the Cologne Museum,\r\nafter Byron had made his propaganda, suggested by the sad lives of the\r\nchildren of Israel, and Friedrich von Uechtritz had caused his drama,\r\n_The Babylonians in Jerusalem_, to be performed, ending as it does with\r\nthe sending of the Jews into captivity in Babylon--\r\n\r\n  \"Wein' über die die weinen fern in Babel,\r\n   Ihr Tempel brach, ihr Land ward, ach! zur Fabel!\r\n   Wein'! es erstart der heil 'gen Harfe Ton,\r\n   Im Haus Jehovas haust der Spötter Hohn.\"\r\n\r\nAnd his oil-paintings of a later date, \"Jeremiah on the Ruins of\r\nJerusalem\" (1834), now in the German Emperor's collection, and the\r\n\"Sending of the Jews into Captivity in Babylon\" (1872), in the Berlin\r\nNational Gallery, were variations on the same theme.\r\n\r\nThe productions of the Düsseldorf school were thus in perfect harmony\r\nwith the programme issued by Püttmann in his book. Pictorial\r\nrepresentations may be taken from two ranges, History or Poetry; the\r\npainter may choose an historical fact as a subject for representation,\r\nor reproduce in visible form the rhythmically shaped fancy of a\r\nstranger. History shows him figures full of expression, and even a less\r\npowerful artist will find it possible to make a true copy of them. If\r\nthe painter works from poems his representations are sure to meet with\r\napproval, as they render the beautiful and the attractive in visible\r\nshape. \"But the greatest success lies in store for those works which\r\ndepict in harmony with the mood of the times historical or poetical\r\nperformances which express human suffering in its various stages, from\r\nhomely and everyday griefs to the silent sorrow of irretrievable\r\ncatastrophe.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOHN.   THE TWO LEONORAS.]\r\n\r\nThus the scale of sorrow from sad melancholy to painful suffering became\r\nthe speciality of the Düsseldorf school. At the foot of the scale we\r\nfind the pictures which \"represent the common, yet keen sorrow of\r\nparents at the death or the sad future of their children.\" Lessing's\r\n\"Royal Pair\" mourn the death of their daughter; Hagar grieves because\r\nshe is forced to abandon her son Ishmael in the desert; Genoveva,\r\nbecause the roe is so long in coming to the rescue. The mortal grief of\r\nlove is represented by Lessing's \"Leonora\"; grief of love at separation\r\nby Sohn's and Hildebrandt's pictures of \"Romeo and Juliet.\" Even the\r\nmurderers of the \"Sons of Edward\" mourn at their crime when they see the\r\nchildren--\r\n\r\n                   \"Girdling one another\r\n  Within their innocent alabaster arms:\r\n  Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,\r\n  Which in their summer beauty kissed each other.\"\r\n\r\nJob grieves at the downfall of his house; Hübner's \"Ruth,\" because her\r\nweeping mother-in-law entreats her to depart; Stilke's \"Pilgrim in the\r\nDesert,\" because his horse has died of thirst; Plüddeman's \"Columbus,\"\r\nbecause he knows himself to be unworthy of the grace of God which\r\nenabled him to discover America; Kiederich's \"Charles V\", because he has\r\nretired too early to his monastery, and is plagued by the ticking of\r\nhis watch. The Hohenstaufens, of course, appealed more to the pity of\r\nthe public: the misfortunes of the beautiful Enzin, of Manfred and\r\nConrad, gave birth to a sentiment of profoundest sadness. Even brigands\r\nmourn at the depravity of the world. The age had come to despise its own\r\nPhilistine situation so deeply that it looked up to the brigands, the\r\nadversaries of civil order, as to representatives of justice. All\r\ndepravity, it was said, originated with the public functionaries, and to\r\nthe noble brigands was allotted the task of revolutionising existing\r\nthings. Their ally in this was to be the poacher. At a time when a\r\nrevision of the game-laws was the sole timid wish the people ventured to\r\nlay before its princes, it was only logical that the poacher should be\r\nlooked upon as the victim of injustice, as the rescuer of the small man\r\nfrom the claws of feudal despotism. The numerous pictures that glorify\r\nhim, as he falls weltering in his blood beneath the guns of the\r\ngamekeepers, make pendants to Raupach's \"Smugglers,\" and to the rest of\r\nthe highly esteemed literature which turned the life of the poacher into\r\nsentimental dramas or novels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LESSING.   THE SORROWING ROYAL PAIR.]\r\n\r\nFortunately we, in our days, find great difficulty in entering into the\r\nspirit which gave birth to these productions. A world lies between it\r\nand the present, just as between the Germany of to-day and the Germany\r\nof 1830. Men of the younger generation, who were still at school when\r\nBismarck spoke his word of blood and iron, can hardly understand how\r\nthis modern, realistic Germany can have been, two generations ago, a\r\nsentimental Germany. Now the significance of the Düsseldorf school in\r\nthe history of civilisation lies in the fact that they are the real\r\nrepresentatives of that age of sentimentality. A generation that melted\r\naway in tearful dreamings must needs enthusiastically recognise its own\r\nflesh and blood in those knights and damsels, squires and pages, monks\r\nand nuns, who, infinitely amorous or infinitely religious, were all\r\ninfinitely sentimental; and things that now only evoke a smile or a\r\nshrug must needs have moved them to tears. Look where you will, you meet\r\nthe same world. It hung on the walls, it displayed itself in engravings,\r\nlithographs, and coloured prints; if one lay down for a siesta, one\r\nfound a lovelorn knight and damsel or a praying nun stitched on the\r\ncushion; if one put one's foot on a carpet, one trod upon noble\r\nhunting-dames on horseback, falcon on wrist; one carried them in one's\r\npockets on cigar-cases and handkerchiefs; the traveller and the cheap\r\ntripper took them abroad on their knapsacks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  BENDEMANN.   THE LAMENT OF THE JEWS.]\r\n\r\nTechnically, the pictures of this school were not without their merits.\r\n\"The greatness of Michael Angelo\" may not have been Bendemann's, and\r\nSohn's carnations are far removed from \"the melting colouring of\r\nTitian.\" But as opposed to the one-sidedness to which fresco painting at\r\nMunich was given up, the encouragement of oil-painting at Düsseldorf\r\nmust be looked upon as praiseworthy. These painters were the first in\r\nGermany to try again to learn how to paint in oils. The extreme artistic\r\nclumsiness that had reigned under Cornelius was followed by a period in\r\nwhich, under Schadow, earnest studies and serious work were devoted to\r\nan effort again to master a technical medium. Their friendly emulation\r\nled to surprising progress, which assured to the Düsseldorf school a\r\ntechnical superiority over all the other German schools of the period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOHN.   THE RAPE OF HYLAS.]\r\n\r\nIf, nevertheless, their pictures have not maintained their position as\r\nvital works of art, it is due to the fact that they were produced under\r\nthe pressure of that mechanical idealism which makes all their\r\nproductions so utterly unattractive to us. The ideal \"line of beauty\"\r\nhas turned the figures into bloodless shadows and washed-out theatrical\r\nforms. As philosophy was to Cornelius, so to the Düsseldorfers was\r\npoetry their Noah's Ark. The interest aroused by the poet was their\r\nally; the breath of the wind that set their boat afloat; the general\r\npoetical tendency made up for the deficiency in artistic interest. Had\r\nit not been for the support of the poets, their sugary, insipid figures\r\nwould have from the beginning been unable to hold their own. For after\r\nhaving been retouched by \"Idealism,\" nothing vital remained in those\r\nromantic kings, fantastic knights, Jews, and stage princesses; nothing\r\nparticular and characteristic in their generalisation, nothing generally\r\nhuman. With them a king is always an heroic prince in black harness, a\r\nwoolly beard, and a scarlet cloak. A queen is represented as proud and\r\ndark, or tender and fair-haired. In the much-beloved \"couples\" from\r\npoems, characterisation goes no further than general contrasts: the\r\n_brunette_ in red attire with white sleeves; the tender _blonde_ with\r\nthe complementary garment of pale violet; the one with luxurious\r\n_embonpoint_, the other languidly slender--men brown, women white,\r\nyouths rosy. Knights wear silvery helmets with or without plumes; now\r\nwith open, now with shut visor; sometimes they sit on poetic palfreys,\r\nnow of slender, now of sturdy build. The only impressions they are\r\nsubject to may be interpreted with the assistance of the plaster bust:\r\nhonour, fidelity, love. And as sentiment and heroism are national\r\nvirtues of the Germans, they are bound to show sentimental expression\r\nwhilst killing their adversaries. Even the brigands are generalised lay\r\nfigures. The Düsseldorf ideal of beauty aimed at a certain tender,\r\nvaguely graceful swing of outline that anxiously avoided all manly and\r\nstrong, energetic and characteristic expression, all that could remind\r\none of nature. They rejected Leonardo da Vinci's advice, to tug at the\r\nnipple of Mother Nature, but looked upon her merely as their aunt; and\r\nfor this, despised Nature took her revenge by making their figures\r\nshapeless and phantom-like. And as their \"dread of painted stupidities\"\r\ndid not once bring them to make bold mistakes, we can neither praise nor\r\ncensure their pictures, cannot enjoy them or take offence at them, but\r\nlook at them _sine ira et studio_, with a lukewarm feeling of utter\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] As is still the case in most of the German theatres, the\r\n    programme changed every night. Two or three consecutive performances\r\n    of one play remain a rarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE LEGACY OF GERMAN ROMANTICISM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for two younger men to reach the aim that hovered in the\r\nfar distance before Cornelius and the Düsseldorfians. And, by one of\r\nfortune's remarkable freaks, the greatest German monumental painter of\r\nthe nineteenth century came from the Düsseldorf, the greatest\r\nRomanticist from the Munich school.\r\n\r\n_Alfred Rethel_ was twenty-four years old when he received the\r\ncommission to paint the frescoes in the _Kaisersaal_ at Aachen, and had\r\npreviously worked in the Düsseldorf Academy, and then with Veit at\r\nFrankfort. But the pictures are suggestive neither of his Düsseldorfian\r\nnor of his Nazarene training. The deeds of Charlemagne, the ancestor of\r\nthe German Imperial dynasties, are nobly, and, at the same time,\r\nvigorously embodied in them. Rethel had studied the harsh strength of\r\nhis Albrecht Dürer, but only as a kindred spirit studies his kin.\r\nNeither Cornelius nor Schnorr has depicted the old German heroic might\r\nand the vanished imperial grandeur, the great past, the iron Middle\r\nAges, with such notable traits. How plain in his heroic greatness stands\r\nthe mighty conqueror of the Saxons by the overthrown pagan idols; how\r\nsimply and majestically does he march into conquered Pavia. What an\r\ninexorable and irresistible warrior he seems, as he rages amongst the\r\nMoors who flock round the cars of their idols; and with what grave\r\nphantom dignity does he gaze in death upon the young Emperor Otto, who\r\nhas forced his way into his vault, and kneels trembling before the\r\nlifeless frame of his great forefather. There is no vestige of pose,\r\nnothing superfluous; everywhere simplicity, compression, lucidity. Only\r\nwhat is necessary is inscribed here, in the lapidary style. No\r\nmeaningless phrase interrupts his narrative; the inner meaning is never\r\nsacrificed to any external beauty of line; his forms like his thoughts\r\nare severe and precise. He draws with a sure hand in crisp lines, like a\r\nwriter who aims at the utmost brevity and so lays especial emphasis on\r\nhis sentences and words. The self-revelation in these pictures is\r\nadmirable--the illuminating clearness with which they tell what they\r\nhave to say without the aid of any commentator, the directness with\r\nwhich they present in an artistic aspect the substance to be given. And\r\nwith this substance the painting corresponds.\r\n\r\nIt is to be deplored that Rethel himself could carry out in colour only\r\nfour of his designs, and that the completion of the rest was entrusted\r\nto the painter Kehren, who spoilt by his effort after charm of colour\r\nthe collective impression of the series. The pictures painted by Rethel\r\nhimself are, in the simplicity of their colouring, in remarkable\r\naccordance with the powerful style of his drawing. Rethel's _painting_\r\nhas something stern and grey, bare and sombre. He belongs to the\r\nstylists whose implement is rather charcoal than the brush; but he had,\r\nalthough no colourist, a free command of colour, and never committed any\r\nfault of taste, but with a remarkably sure instinct used colour in the\r\nmass, simply, but yet with significant effect. He might have been the\r\nman to create a monumental German art. A tragic destiny! Heinrich von\r\nKleist, the greatest German poet of the post-classical age, who was\r\nchosen for so high a vocation, the creation of a new dramatic style,\r\nshot himself; and the giant, Alfred Rethel, was to end in madness.\r\nBarely forty years old was he when he walked by the warder's side in the\r\ncourtyard at Düsseldorf, picking up flint-stones, a poor, simple madman.\r\nOnly two series of designs ensure, apart from the frescoes at Aix, the\r\nimmortality of his name: \"Hannibal's Passage over the Alps,\" and the\r\n\"Dance of Death.\" As a draughtsman, just as a painter of frescoes, he is\r\nthe same Titan, sounds the same stern, manly note.\r\n\r\nHere the heroic hosts of the Carthaginians stand anxious, yet resolved,\r\nat the foot of the grim Alpine pass; steep, beetling cliffs, precipice,\r\nice and snow, tower before them. Now the climb begins, and the struggle\r\nwith the fierce, barbaric folk of the mountains, who swing themselves on\r\nleaping-pole like wild animals over the gaping crevices in the ice.\r\nYonder are men, horses, an elephant, hurled into the abyss; some have\r\nspitted themselves on jagged branches of trees in their fall, others\r\ntwine themselves together in horrible coils; at last the most advanced\r\nhave reached the heights, and the heroic figure of the commander points\r\nout proudly to them, as they breathe once more, the plains of Italy.\r\n\r\nOver his second work there broods the shadow of that mental darkness\r\nwhich was to surround him. When, in the year 1848, the political storm\r\nburst over the soil of Europe, Rethel's fantasy reaped a rich harvest.\r\nHe drew his \"Dance of Death,\" represented Death the Leveller, who drives\r\npoor fools behind the barricades. The ghostly and spectral, that horror\r\nof death that breaks in upon us in the midst of life, had been the\r\npropensity of German art since Dürer and Holbein. Like them, Rethel\r\nloved the world of the diabolical, and similarly chose for his\r\nembodiment of it the sturdy, simple contours of the old German wood\r\nengravings. Death as the hero of revolution makes a commencement. There\r\nhe rides as the town-executioner, a cigar between his lips, his scythe\r\nin his hand. He sits shambling in the saddle, his smock and tall boots\r\ndangle on his bony figure. Dressed like a charlatan, he excites the\r\npeople before the tavern against the rulers, that he may earn his\r\nharvest at the barricade. He himself stands firm and proud, like a\r\ngeneral on the field of battle, the flag in his hand, and the bullets of\r\nthe soldiers whistling harmlessly through his bony ribs. But the\r\nartisans who follow him are not invulnerable as he is; the grape-shot\r\nsweeps them down off the barricade. The contest is over; triumphant,\r\nwith a wreath of bay round his skull, mocking venom in his glance, Death\r\nrides with his banner unfurled across the barricade, where the dying\r\nwrithe in their gaunt death-struggle, and children bewail their fallen\r\nfathers. The plate, \"Death as the Assassin,\" takes up the story of the\r\noutbreak of cholera at a masked ball in Paris. In terrified haste the\r\ndancers and musicians leave the hall. Only one mummy-like spectre, the\r\nCholera himself, a shape of horror, keeps his ground, as though turned\r\nto stone, and holds the triumphant scourge like a sceptre in his bony\r\nhand. Death, in a domino, with two bones for a fiddle, plays a call to\r\nthe dance; and beneath the awful sounds of his tune the people,\r\nstretched on the ground, in sick convulsions, grinning with distorted\r\nfeatures, behind their jesters' masks, twist and turn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RETHEL.   THE EMPEROR OTTO AT THE TOMB OF CHARLEMAGNE.]\r\n\r\nThere is something of Th. A. Hofmann's wild fantasy of the ague-fit in\r\nthis picture,--something morbid, satanic, that suggests Félicien Rops;\r\nyet, at the same time, something so pithy and virile, and in form so\r\ncompressed, well-balanced, and correct, that it brings the old Germans,\r\ntoo, to our recollection. And the reconciliation with which the series\r\nends is pathetic. In the high steeple, lit by the rays of the setting\r\nsun, the grey old bellringer, his worn hands clasped in prayer, has\r\nfallen quietly asleep in his armchair. A calm peace rests upon his good,\r\nold, devout countenance. The thin hands, with their marks and furrows,\r\ntell a long tale of hard work, sorrow, and longing for rest. And the\r\nweary veteran has made a pilgrimage for the health of his poor soul, as\r\nprove the pilgrim's hat and staff by the wall; and now Death has really\r\ncome, the well-known presence indeed, but this time with no grin of\r\nmockery, rather in profound pity. In his ingenious manner of giving an\r\nexpression of mockery, cold indifference, or compassion to the head of\r\nthe skeleton, Rethel stands on a level with Holbein. To the old ringer,\r\nDeath, who before had grinned so diabolically, is a gentle and trusted\r\nfriend. Quietly and pensively he performs the task that the old man has\r\ndone so often when he attended the departure of some pilgrim of earth\r\nwith the solemn notes of his bell. Rethel himself had still to drag\r\nthrough many years in an obscure night of the spirit before for him,\r\ntoo, Death, as the friend, rang the knell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RETHEL.   THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PAGAN IDOLS.]\r\n\r\nAnd now for him who was the most admirable of them all, Lady Adventure's\r\ntrue knight.\r\n\r\n\"Master _Schwind_, you are a genius and a Romanticist.\" This stereotyped\r\ncompliment was paid by King Ludwig to the painter on each occasion that,\r\nwithout buying anything of him, he visited his studio. And with equal\r\nregularity Schwind, when he had sat down again at his easel, after the\r\nroyal visit, to smoke his pipe, is said to have muttered something\r\nextremely disloyal. In this trait the whole Schwind is already\r\nrevealed,--free from all ambition, every inch an artist.\r\n\r\nW. H. Riehl has described a series of such episodes, which one must know\r\nin order to understand Schwind, that highly gifted child of nature, who\r\nseparates himself from the group of philosophical, \"meditative\" artists\r\nof his age, both as an individual and as an audacious, original genius\r\nof effervescent wit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  RETHEL.   HANNIBAL'S PASSAGE OVER THE ALPS.]\r\n\r\nWhen an æsthetic once hailed him as \"the creator of an original, German\r\nkind of ideal, romantic art,\" Schwind repeated very slowly, weighing\r\neach word: \"'An original, German kind of ideal, romantic art.' My dear\r\nsir, to me there are only two kinds of pictures, the sold and the\r\nunsold; and to me the sold are always the best. Those are my entire\r\næsthetics.\" Or a noble amateur comes to him with the request that he\r\nwould take him just for a few days into his school, and instruct him\r\nespecially in his masterly art of drawing in pencil. Whereupon Schwind:\r\n\"It does not require a day for that, my dear Baron; I can tell you in\r\nthree minutes how I do it, I can give you all the desired information at\r\nonce. Here lies my paper,--kindly remark it, I buy it of Bullinger, 6\r\nResidenz Strasse; these are my pencils, A. W. Faber's, I get them from\r\nAndreas Kaut, 10 Kaufinger Strasse; from the same firm I have this\r\nindiarubber too, but I very seldom use it, so that I use this penknife\r\nall the more, to sharpen the pencils; it's from Tresch, 10 Dienersgasse,\r\nand very good value. Now, I have all these things lying together on the\r\ntable, and a few thoughts in my head as well; then I sit down here and\r\nbegin to draw. And now you know all that I can tell you.\" Again he asks\r\n\"to be decorated with an order,\" because he \"is ashamed to mix in such a\r\nnaked condition with his bestarred confrères,\" and after the bestowal\r\nof the desired decoration he says: \"I wore it only once, at the last New\r\nYear's levée, but I vowed at the same time that six horses should not\r\ndrag me there again. Before, there was at any rate a beautiful queen\r\nthere, and then the court ladies laughed at one; but amongst men only,\r\nthe stupidity of it is not to be endured.\" When he grumbles over\r\ncommissions which have been given to others, and adds good-temperedly,\r\n\"Indeed, I'm an envious fellow\"; when he paints the most delicate\r\npictures and then growls, \"What am I to do with the things, if nobody\r\nbuys them?\" when he indulges in outbursts of wrath, and a minute later\r\nhas forgotten again the abusive words which the others spitefully bring\r\nup against him years afterwards,--then here, too, his happy humour\r\nforces its way everywhere, that divine naïveté which forms the soul of\r\nhis and of all true art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RETHEL.   DEATH AT THE MASKED BALL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  RETHEL.   DEATH THE FRIEND OF MAN.]\r\n\r\nSchwind remains a personality by himself--the last of the Romanticists,\r\nand one of the most amiable manifestations in German art. He was free\r\nfrom the malady of that sham Romanticism which sought the salvation of\r\nart in the resurrection of the Middle Ages, misunderstood, and grasped\r\nsentimentally, and as it were by stencil. He was spiritually permeated\r\nby that which had given Romanticism the capacity to exist: the sense of\r\nthat forgotten and imperishable world of beauty which it has again\r\ndiscovered. The others sought for the \"blue flower,\" Schwind found it;\r\nresuscitated in all its faëry beauty that \"fair night of enchantment\r\nwhich holds the mind captive.\" He incorporated the romantic idea in\r\npainting as Weber did in music, and his works, like the _Freischütz_,\r\nwill live for ever. Many a man listened to him holding forth upon\r\nwater-nymphs, gnomes, and tricksy kobolds, as of beings of whose\r\nexistence he appeared to have no doubt whatever. On one occasion, while\r\nout walking near Eisenach in the Annathal, a friend laughingly observed\r\nto him that the landscape really looked as if gnomes had made the\r\npathway and had had their dwellings there. \"Don't you believe it was so?\r\n_I_ believe it,\" answered Schwind in all seriousness. He _lived_ in the\r\nworld of legend and fairy-tale. If ever a fairy stood beside the cradle\r\nof a mortal man, assuredly there was one standing by Schwind's; and all\r\nhis life long he believed in her and raved about her. Born in the land\r\nwhere Neidhart of Neuenthal had sung and the Parson of the Kahlenberg\r\nhad dwelt, to his eyes Germany was overshadowed with ancient Teutonic\r\noaks: for him, elves hovered about watersprings and streams, their white\r\nrobes trailing behind them through the dewy grass; a race of gnomes held\r\ntheir habitation on the mountain heights, and water-nymphs bathed in\r\nevery pool. In him part of the Middle Ages came back to life, not in\r\nlivid, corpse-like pallor, but fanned by the revivifying breath of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nFor that is what is noteworthy about Schwind; he is a Romanticist, yet\r\nat the same time a genuine, modern child of Vienna. There are three\r\nthings in each of which Vienna stands supreme: hers are the fairest\r\nwomen, the sweetest songs, and the most beautiful waltzes. The\r\natmosphere of Vienna sends forth a soft and sensual breath which\r\nencircles us as though with women's arms; songs and dances slumber in\r\nthe air, waiting only for a call to be awakened. Vienna is a place for\r\nenjoyment rather than for work, for pensive dreaming rather than for\r\nsober wakefulness of mind. Moritz Schwind was a child of this city of\r\nbeautiful women, songs, and dances, as may be observed in the feminine\r\nnature of his art, in its melody and rhythm: in music, indeed, it had\r\nits source. In song-singing, bell-ringing Vienna it was difficult for\r\nhim to guess in what direction his talents lay; but all his life long he\r\nkept an open eye for the charms of beautiful womanhood. No artist of\r\nthat time has created lovelier forms of women, beings with so great a\r\ncharm of maidenly freshness and modest grace. Instead of the goddesses,\r\nheroines, and nun-like female saints, whose appearance dated from the\r\nItaly of the Cinquecento, Schwind depicted modern feminine charm. The\r\ngroup of ladies in \"Ritter Kurt\" is, even to the movement of their\r\ngloved fingers, graceful in the modern sense. He was a painter of\r\nlove--a breath of Walter von der Vogelweide's ideal perfection of\r\nwomanhood pervades his pictures.\r\n\r\n  \"Durchsüsset und geblümet sind die reinen Frauen,\r\n   Es ward nie nichts so Wonnigliches anzuschauen,\r\n   In Lüften, auf Erden, noch in allen grünen Auen.\"\r\n\r\nSchwind, too, painted frescoes, and in them he is very unequal. All his\r\nlife long he complained of the lack of important commissions; it was\r\nfortunate for him that he did not get more of them. Such a painter as he\r\ncan execute no orders but his own,--just as good poems do not come to\r\norder. A long list of wall paintings--the Tieck room and the\r\nfigure-frieze in the Habsburg Hall of the new palace at Munich, the\r\nfrescoes in the Kunsthall and in the Hall of Assembly of the Upper House\r\nat Karlsruhe, those in the Castle of Hohenschwangau, even the theatre\r\npieces in the loggia and in the foyer of the Vienna Opera House--could\r\nbe easily struck out of Schwind's work, without detriment to his\r\nreputation. Only when the subject permitted him to strike a simple note\r\nof fairy music was he charming even in his wall-paintings, and therefore\r\nthose which depict scenes from the life of St. Elizabeth in the\r\nWartburg are rightly the most celebrated. Like Rethel in the field of\r\nthe heroic, so Schwind in that of romantic legend reached the goal which\r\nthe former kept before his eyes, for the revivifying of the time when\r\nthere was an enthusiasm for fresco painting. His paintings are poor in\r\ncolour, motley, magic-lantern views in the style of the heraldically\r\ntreated figures seen in the frescoes and stained glass of the Romanesque\r\nand early Gothic Middle Ages, and yet in every line as delightful as the\r\nman himself. Nowhere do we find glaring contrasts, nowhere any violent\r\nagitation in the expression of the faces. It is by the avoidance of all\r\nlandscape accessories, and by a hardly noticeable change in the simple\r\nplant-ornamentation in the background, that the events represented are\r\nmade to lose touch with actual reality. In the first picture,\r\nbright-hued birds flit here and there among the rose-branches forming\r\nthe decorative work; in that which treats of St. Elizabeth's expulsion,\r\nthe Wartburg rises in the background, while little singing angels are\r\nperched upon the boughs of the bare winter-stripped trees that overlook\r\nthe miserable cell in which St. Elizabeth dies. A touch of the\r\ntrue-heartedness of the ancient Teuton, a breath of peacefulness,\r\npermeates Schwind's Wartburg pictures like the waft of an angel's wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MORITZ SCHWIND.   _Graphische Künste._]\r\n\r\nSchwind, like Rethel, is numbered among the few artists of that period\r\nwho were able to preserve their absolute simplicity against the great\r\npainters of Italy. \"I went into the Sistine Chapel,\" he says of his\r\njourney to Rome, \"gazed upon Michael Angelo's work, and sauntered back\r\nhome to work at my 'Ritter Kurt.' I take the greatest possible pleasure\r\nin my present picture, although the subject is absolutely crazy. I love\r\nto paint trees and rocks and old walls, and I have put plenty of them\r\ninto it, besides a fellow on horseback and in full armour. What does it\r\nmatter? _One must work according to one's natural capacity. Even at the\r\ntime when I was studying at Munich I came to the conclusion that that of\r\nwhich the mind of itself takes hold, and that which takes hold of it, is\r\nthe one only right thing for every man who has a vocation. Art consists\r\nof this unconscious taking hold and being taken hold of. Deus in nobis._\r\nAnd therefore the young artist will do well to be careful in visiting\r\nthe museums. You go to the galleries where the works of the great\r\nmasters are to be seen. There you see, all at once and all together in\r\nconfusion, works of every school and of every era. It is extremely\r\nlikely that you are overwhelmed by the mass, and beauties of every kind,\r\nbelonging to tendencies and epochs altogether diverse, shake the ground\r\nunder your budding vocation, and like fifty various climates influencing\r\na single plant, arrest a growth which is possible only in one, and that\r\na favourable one. _The imitation of the Italians in especial can as a\r\nrule have only the effect of estranging us from our own individuality_,\r\na fact which was once again fully borne in upon me when I saw Overbeck's\r\nnew altar-piece in the Cathedral of Cologne. It may sound severe and\r\nuncalled-for from me, but _every man who has forgotten his mother-tongue\r\nis tottering on his feet. The imitation of foreigners is the dangerous\r\nblind alley into which our art has betaken itself_. When I exhibited\r\n'Ritter Kurt' people said, 'It is Old German,' and forthwith it stood\r\ncondemned, as if that were a disgrace, and as if one should not rather\r\nhave saluted the fact with joy, as the right thing for us Germans. The\r\nart of painting which I follow is the German, and glass-painting must be\r\ntaken as its foundation.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHWIND.   FROM THE WARTBURG FRESCOES.]\r\n\r\nIn Schwind one might imagine an old German master of the race of\r\nAlbrecht Altdorfer come to life again. In the small, simple pictures of\r\nlandscape and fairy-tale, which Count Schack has collected in his\r\nprivate gallery for the quiet and devout enjoyment of thousands, he has\r\ngiven us his best work as a painter.\r\n\r\nYet even _his_ pictures have the failings of his time. Compared with\r\nDürer, he seems like a gifted amateur; there are manifold empty, dead\r\nspaces to be observed among his figures; their action is at times\r\nmisconceived and puppet-like; and his sense of colour was always\r\nlimited. One may be permitted to look forward to some master, at the\r\nhead of a coming epoch in art, who shall combine with Schwind's German\r\nfairy imagination the sensuous, dashing colour-elf that possessed\r\nBoecklin. There might a school of art arise, to follow for the future\r\nthe path which Franz Stuck has struck out. As to technique, Schwind was\r\na child of the cartoon era; as regards tenderness of feeling, he is a\r\nmodern. It is difficult to persuade a non-German of Schwind's greatness,\r\nin presence of the _pictures_; but when they are reduced to\r\nblack-and-white they appeal to every one. The heliogravure enables one\r\nto imagine what the original does not show; it incites the soul to\r\nfurther poetic creation, it announces what Schwind would be were he\r\nalive to-day. An elfland kingdom of enchantment, full of genuine poetry\r\nand beauty, opens out before us; a fairy garden, where the \"blue flower\"\r\npours forth the whole of its sense-benumbing perfume. Count von\r\nGleichen; the boy's miraculous horn; the mountain spirit Rübezahl,\r\nwandering along through the wild mountain forest; the hermits; the\r\nelves' dance; the erlking; the knight and the water nymph,--they are\r\nflooded with all the enchantment of Romanticism, they possess deep\r\nfeeling without mawkishness, the old-German note of fairy legend and\r\nHans Memlinc's childlike simplicity, yet at the same time the life of\r\nthe present day, full of feeling and rich in delicate shades. How strong\r\nand brave are the men; how tender, noble, and charming the women! What a\r\nmodest, maidenly art it is! just as its master was an innocent,\r\nharmless, and joyous being.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHWIND.   FROM THE WARTBURG FRESCOES.]\r\n\r\nHis works, in comparison with those of his contemporaries, who were\r\ndevising systems by means of which art should be brought back to the\r\nclassical, bear the stamp of naïve creations in which no hypocrisy, no\r\ndecorative nothingness finds expression. As against the erudite\r\ntreatises of the Cornelius school, they preached for the first time the\r\ndoctrine, that in works of art what is important is not the quantity of\r\nlearning displayed therein, but the quality of the feeling exhibited.\r\nWith all their inequalities, all their incorrectness, all their weak\r\npoints, they are inspired, sung, dreamed, and not put together in cold\r\nblood according to recipes: in them is the pulsation of a human heart, a\r\ntender human heart full of delicate feeling. This it is which\r\nconstitutes his magical attraction to-day, which makes him the firm bond\r\nof connection between the moderns. He was no imitator, no soulless\r\ncalligraphist performing laborious school exercises after the manner of\r\nthe old masters; he spoke the language of his time.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the first who at that time laid aside the prejudice\r\nagainst modern costume, and in his \"Symphony\" turned to artistic\r\naccount, in one fantastic whole, even Franz Lachner's frockcoat and\r\nFräulein Hetzenecker's modern society toilette. \"If you may paint a man\r\nhidden in an iron stove--what is called a knight in armour--you may\r\nstill more permissibly paint a man in a frockcoat. In general, one can\r\npaint what one will, provided always that one wills what one can.\" And\r\nit was only by means of this present-day temper that Romanticism could\r\nfind so full-toned an expression in his works. Only because he was truly\r\na citizen of the present day and felt its blood beating in his veins,\r\ncould he feel the congenial elements of the past. To him the old-time\r\nlegends were no antiquarian, erudite, pedantic lumber; they were a part\r\nof himself, and he interpreted them in more childlike simplicity of\r\nmanner and with more delicate feeling than any artist of former times,\r\nbecause he observed them with the eye of the present age, with an eye\r\nmade keen with longing. Just as in his \"Wedding Journey\" he raised all\r\nreality into the poetry of purest romance, so is his Romanticism\r\nsaturated with a sense of reality charged with memories of home. Out of\r\nhis fairy-tale pictures is breathed a charming fragrance of the\r\nlong-vanished days of earth's first springtide, and yet for that very\r\nreason a breath of the most modern Décadence. He is distinguished from\r\nMarées and Burne-Jones, from Puvis de Chavannes and Gustave Moreau, by a\r\nvery unmodern attribute--he is bursting with health. He is still naïvely\r\nchildlike, free from that elegiac melancholy, that temper of weary\r\nresignation, which the end of the nineteenth century first brought into\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHWIND.   WIELAND THE SMITH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Neft, Helio._\r\n\r\n  SCHWIND.   FROM THE STORY OF THE SEVEN RAVENS.]\r\n\r\nYet Schwind was one of the first to feel and give expression to that\r\nmodern sense of longing desire which turns back from a nervous,\r\ncolourless age, from the prosiness of everyday life, towards a vanished\r\nSaturnian era, when man still lived at peace and undisturbed in happy\r\nunion with nature. For even this proclaims him our contemporary, that\r\nthe temper of his pictures develops itself from the landscape. A\r\nlandscape painter through and through--almost in Boecklin's sense,\r\nwho transformed the temper of Nature into the contemplation of living\r\nbeings--he spoke of the rest and peace of German forests, of that hour\r\nof summer's night when no wind blows, no leaflet moves, when to the\r\nsolitary wanderer in the woods the mists rising from the meadows are\r\ntransformed into white veils of the elves, and the gold-rimmed waves of\r\nthe sea into the yellow hair of mermaids frolicking in the moonlight to\r\nthe magic notes of their golden harps. He felt and loved his landscapes\r\nrather than studied them, yet they are saturated with an entirely modern\r\nsentiment for Nature. No German, at that time, had caught and understood\r\nthe interweaving of the forest boughs with such intimate familiarity.\r\nThe fresh sunshine of the morning breaks through the light green of the\r\nyoung beeches, and leaps from bough to bough, transforming the\r\nglittering dewdrops into diamonds, and the beetle, creeping comfortably\r\nover the soft moss, into gold and precious stones. \"_Da gehet leise nach\r\nseiner Weise der liebe Herrgott durch den Wald_\" (\"The dear God holy, He\r\npasseth slowly, as His wont is, through the wood\"). With a few boldly\r\ndrawn lines and light colours we are transported into the midst of the\r\nforest world, and all around us opening buds and verdurous green, sweet\r\nscents, and the murmur of leaves. \"When one has set one's love and joy\r\non a beautiful tree so fully,\" he said to Ludwig Richter, \"one depicts\r\nall one's love and joy with it, and then the tree looks quite different\r\nfrom an ass's fine daub of what he thinks it should be.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Albert, Helio._\r\n\r\n  SCHWIND.   A HERMIT LEADING HORSES TO A POOL.]\r\n\r\nOnly so intimate a connection with Nature could enable Schwind to\r\nimagine landscapes, which in their virginal old-world mood form at once\r\nthe echo of the figures and of their actions. These green meadows and\r\nflower-besprent hills, these gloomy wooded slopes, these smooth valleys\r\nthrough which glittering waters glide murmuring along, are fit and\r\nsuitable dwelling-places for the delicate fabulous beings of the\r\nflower-entwined old fairy legends. Schwind _lived_ with Nature. He gave\r\nthe name of Tanneck (Fir-tree Corner) to the little country house which\r\nhe built for himself on the Starnberger See, and the fresh scent of\r\npinewood, the rustling sound of German forests, pour forth from his\r\npictures. Like young Siegfried, he understood the language of birds, and\r\nwent eavesdropping to hear what the pine trees whispered to one another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHWIND.   THE WEDDING JOURNEY.]\r\n\r\nStill freer, more spontaneous, and lighter than in his oil paintings was\r\nhis touch in his water-colours, in which the colour is only breathed\r\nover the forms like a delicate vapour; and quite especially in his\r\nillustrations--so far as the word may be employed with respect to him,\r\nfor he never illustrated, he gave shape to his own thoughts, and that\r\nonly which moved his innermost being he brought fully formed before\r\none's eye. The _Bilderbogen_ and the _Fliegende Blätter_ of Munich\r\nobtained from him witty and humorous inventions, such as \"The Almond\r\nTree,\" \"Puss in Boots,\" \"The Peasant and the Donkey,\" \"Herr Winter,\" and\r\n\"The Acrobat Games.\" His fairest legacy consists of three cyclic works:\r\n\"Cinderella,\" \"The Seven Ravens,\" and \"The Beautiful Melusina\"; wherein\r\nhe glorified with praise the beauty and fidelity of women, and their\r\ncapacity for self-sacrifice. \"Cinderella,\" which appeared in 1855, at\r\nthe Munich Exhibition, is a fairy-tale, than which poet has seldom,\r\nindeed, narrated a chaster, tenderer, or more fragrant. In 1858 followed\r\nthe touching story of the good sister who releases her brothers by dint\r\nof unspeakable suffering and endurance, to-day the priceless pearl among\r\nthe gems of the Weimar collection. For twenty years, as he said, the\r\nwork had been in his thoughts. So far back as in 1844 he wrote to\r\nGenelli: \"I believe that it will give something which may please people\r\nwho have a sense for love and faithfulness, and for a touch of the power\r\nof enchantment.\" When an acquaintance of his gazed upon it with dismay,\r\nand ingenuously asked for whom the thing was intended, and whither it\r\nwas to go, Schwind turned his penetrating, flashing little eyes upon\r\nhim, and then said: \"Do you know, I painted that for myself; it is the\r\ndream of my life; no one shall buy it; some day I shall give it to a\r\nfriend.\" It is an imperishable work, full of grace, modesty, and charm.\r\n\r\nSchwind takes the story up at the fateful moment when the lonely maiden,\r\nwho is determined to release her enchanted brothers by assiduous\r\nspinning and constant silence, is discovered by a hunting party. There,\r\namid the enchantment of the forest solitude, she sits in the hollow of a\r\ntree and spins away at the seven shirts, to free her seven brothers.\r\nThus the king's son catches sight of her. The fire of love kindles in\r\nhis eyes. In one long kiss the maiden gives herself to him. The wedding\r\ntakes place, and like another St. Elizabeth she is seen standing, soon\r\nafterwards, distributing alms to starving beggars. Yet, meanwhile, she\r\nhas fallen under suspicion owing to her continuous silence; even her\r\nhusband becomes distrustful, because in the quiet of night he has\r\nobserved that she is not resting by his side, but is quietly up and\r\nspinning. And the catastrophe comes when the silent queen gives birth to\r\ntwins, who, to the horror of all around, fly off in the form of ravens.\r\nTranquil and affectionate, the young mother awaits her fate. Then follow\r\nthe sentence of the Vehm-tribunal, the pathetic parting from her\r\nhusband, the preparation for death. There is only one hour more to pass\r\nby before the seven years are over and the spellbound brothers set free.\r\nThe good fairy appears in the air, hour-glass in hand, and brings solace\r\nto the hard-pressed heroine. The beggars, too, whose benefactress she\r\nhad been, bring help, and hold the gate of the dungeon in force. So the\r\ntime runs out, the spell is broken, and the brothers hasten, on\r\nmilk-white horses, to save their sister from the stake. In Schwind's\r\nmarvellous drawings the story passes quickly on, stroke by stroke,\r\ndeeply moving and soul-stirring in its dramatic force.\r\n\r\nThe \"Beautiful Melusina\" was the kiss of the water-nymph, with which\r\nRomanticism led her faithful knight to his death, only to disappear\r\ntogether with him out of German art. \"The winter has dealt me a sore\r\nblow; I shall never be able to do anything more.\" Carl Maria von Weber\r\nand Uhland had already gone before; Schwind was lying on his sick-bed\r\nwhen the German victories created a German fatherland. He learned,\r\nhowever, all the long series of glorious tidings that came from the\r\nfield of war, saw the tumultuous joy and the dazzling sea of fire which\r\nsurged through Munich in January 1871, and heard the joyful news that\r\nGermany was at last united. Then he had a glass of champagne poured out\r\nfor him, and drank it to the new empire and the future of the nation.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of a wood of lofty beeches in Bernrieder Park, on the\r\nStarnberger See, there stands a small rotunda, within is a prattling\r\nfountain, right round the walls runs a frieze, depicting the legend of\r\nthe \"Beautiful Melusina.\" It is Schwind's monument. With him German\r\nRomanticism perished; reality itself had now become so marvellous. When,\r\nin 1850, Hübner had to paint a figure of Germania for a page in King\r\nLudwig's album, he depicted a queenly woman, prone on the ground, with\r\nher face in the dust, amidst a desolate landscape and under a cloudy\r\nsky. The crown has fallen from her head and a skull lies by her side,\r\nwhile on the frame are inscribed these words from the Book of\r\nLamentations: \"Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the\r\ndestruction of the daughter of my people; the crown of our head is\r\nfallen.\" When Schwind died, Germany had re-arisen. In the very year of\r\nhis death, Lenbach painted his first Bismarck pictures: in Bismarck was\r\nembodied that power by means of which the dream of a nation was\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHWIND.   NYMPHS AND STAG.]\r\n\r\nThus Schwind's works are not only the sign of a completed period in\r\nGerman history, but also at the same time both the climax and the\r\nconclusion of an art-epoch. Schwind had lived through the entire\r\nrevolution which German painting had at that time undergone. At his\r\ndeath the sound of the hunting horns of Romanticism had died away. He\r\nhad lived long enough to have the opportunity of criticising neatly, as\r\nfollows, the dry, unpoetical school of historical painting then making\r\nits appearance, as if introduced by gaudily costumed models, a school\r\nwhich made its first hit with Lessing's \"Ezzelino\": \"I will explain the\r\npicture to you. Ezzelino is seated in his dungeon, and two monks are\r\nattempting to convert him. One of them recognises that all pains are\r\nthrown away upon the old sinner, and takes himself off, regretfully\r\ndesisting from all further endeavour; the other still has hopes, and\r\ncontinues his exhortations. But Ezzelino only keeps his angry gaze fixed\r\nbefore him, muttering, 'Leave me alone! Don't you see that I am--posing\r\nas a model!'\" He had had occasion to write to his friend Bauernfeld: \"I\r\nhave seen so many schools of so-called painting in my time that it is an\r\nabsolute horror to me\"; he had asked Piloty: \"What calamity are you\r\npreparing for us now?\" and had thought it his duty to address to one of\r\nthe younger painters the question: \"Are we then an academy of the Fine\r\nor of the Ugly Arts?\" \"A man like me, with his ideas, walks like a ghost\r\namid the battle of the virtuosi, in which the whole life of art has gone\r\nastray,\" he used sadly to say. His last wonderful works stand alone in\r\na time which was dazzled by the flash of arms characterising the\r\nFranco-Belgian school of art. It was not till much later that Hans Thoma\r\ntook up the threads which connect the work of Schwind with the present\r\nepoch. When he died he was a solitary, isolated man taking leave of a\r\ngeneration in which he had no part. The period of historical painting\r\nwhich followed him produced no single work distinguished by Schwind's\r\nsense of fragrant legendary poetry. The charming forest fairy who had\r\nappeared to him showed herself to no other; like the betrayed Melusina,\r\nshe had returned to rest again, solitary, in her fountain home. Fantasy,\r\ntender soul that she is, had taken wings, whither none can tell. \"That\r\nis why nobody has a single idea,\" as Schwind said in his drastic way.\r\nThe Muse of Schwind, the last Romanticist, was a chaste, pensive,\r\nsoulful maiden; while that of Piloty, the first colourist, was a noisy,\r\nbloodthirsty Megæra. Yet one can have no doubt as to the necessity of\r\nthis evolutionary change.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Albert, Helio._\r\n\r\n  SCHWIND.   RUBEZAHL.]\r\n\r\nSchwind himself is among the masters \"who have been, and are, and shall\r\nbe.\" He was different from all that was arising around him; he embodied\r\nthe spirit of the future, and exercises over the art of the present day\r\nso great an influence that where two or three painters are gathered\r\ntogether in the name of the beautiful, he has his place in the midst of\r\nthem, and is present, invisible, at every exhibition. But he exercises\r\nthis influence only spiritually. Young artists study him as if he were a\r\nprimitive master. Enraptured, they find in him all those qualities for\r\nwhich there is to-day so ardent a longing--innocent purity and touching\r\nsimplicity, a mystic, romantic submersion in waves of old-time feeling\r\nand a charming youthful fervour. They do not study him in order to\r\n_paint_ like him.\r\n\r\n\"Our heads are full of poetry, but we cannot give it expression,\" are\r\nthe words with which Cornelius himself characterised this period.\r\nGermany had original geniuses indeed, but no fully matured school to\r\ncompare with the French; as yet the Germans did not know how to paint.\r\nUp to this time the course of painting in Germany had been a bold but\r\nimprudent flight through the air; in its Kaulbach-like cloud-heights it\r\nhad melted away to a shadow, only to fall again, somewhat roughly, to\r\nthe ground. It died of an incurable disease--idealism. The painters of\r\nthat time, one and all, had never become real artists; strictly\r\nspeaking, they had always remained amateurs. He alone is a great artist\r\nin whom the will and the performance, the substance and the form, are in\r\ncomplete accordance. Painters who never knew exactly what is meant by\r\npainting, artists whose most noticeable characteristic was that they had\r\nno art-capacity, were only possible in the first half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury in Germany, where for that very reason they were admired and\r\npraised.\r\n\r\nWhat now began was a necessary making good what had been so long\r\nneglected. For craftsmanship is the necessary presupposition of all art,\r\nwhich can no longer suffer any one to be called a master who has not\r\nlearnt his business. In the atmosphere of incense which surrounded\r\nCornelius in Munich, the dogma that salvation was to be found in German\r\nart alone, and that the German nation was the chosen people of art, had\r\nreached a height of self-adoration which came near to megalomania. In\r\nthe proud enthusiasm of those times, great in their aims as in their\r\nerrors, the Germans had as false an opinion as possible of the art of\r\nforeign countries.\r\n\r\nIn the very years when the first railways were ousting the old\r\nmail-coaches the mutual interchange of endeavour and ability between the\r\nvarious nations was slower and scantier than ever before. How German\r\nartists had wandered abroad in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, in\r\nthat great age when Dürer crossed the Alps on Pirkheymer's pony, and\r\nwhen Holbein obtained from Erasmus letters of introduction for England!\r\nWith what joy Dürer, in his letters and in his journal, gives an account\r\nof the recognition accorded him in artistic circles in Italy and the\r\nDutch cities! Nearly all the German painters had, in the course of their\r\nlong wanderings, made acquaintance with either the Netherlands or Italy.\r\nThey knew exactly what was going on in the world around them. Dürer and\r\nRaphael used to send drawings to each other, \"so as to know each other's\r\nhandwriting.\" It was only in the first half of the nineteenth century\r\nthat the Germans, once proud in the consciousness of possessing the\r\nfinest comprehension of, and the greatest receptivity for, foreign\r\nintellectual wares, lived apart in timid isolation. Into the suburban\r\nstill-life of the German schools of art not a sound made its way of what\r\nwas taking place elsewhere. Only thus was it possible for the Germans to\r\nimagine that among all modern nations they alone had a vocation for Art.\r\nNo one had the least idea that in England, the land of machines and\r\nbeefsteaks, there were men who painted; and people went so far as to\r\nproclaim piety, morality, thoroughness, accurate draughtsmanship, and\r\ndiligent execution the monopoly of German art; and superficiality,\r\nfrivolity, and \"empty straining after effect\" the ineradicable national\r\nfailing of that of France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHWIND.   THE FAIRIES' SONG.]\r\n\r\nWith some such ideas in their heads the majority of the German painters,\r\nin the autumn of 1843, found themselves confronted by Gallait's\r\n\"Abdication of Charles V\" and Bièfve's \"Agreement of the Dutch\r\nNobility\"; two Belgian pictures which at that time were going the round\r\nof the exhibitions in all the larger towns of Germany. And it was not\r\nlong before the belief in the old gods, which had for thirty years held\r\nsway in the city of King Ludwig, was completely undermined by the\r\nyounger generation. \"Even for the great gods, day comes to an end. Night\r\nof annihilation, descend with the dusk!\" Diogenes expelled from his\r\nphilosophic tub could not have felt more uncomfortable than the German\r\npainters in presence of the Belgian pictures. As till then the\r\nincapacity to paint had been belauded as one of the strongest possible\r\nproofs of the higher artistic nature and of genuine greatness, so now it\r\nwas perceived that nevertheless, on the banks of the Scheldt and of the\r\nSeine, a much greater school of painting was in full bloom, and\r\nproducing splendid fruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE FORERUNNERS OF ROMANTICISM IN FRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn France the first decade of the century gave no premonition of the\r\npowerful development which was shortly to take place in French art. A\r\nlegion of characterless pupils issuing from David's studio wearied the\r\nworld with their aimless works, and hurled their thunderbolts against\r\nall rising talent. The austere catalogue of the Salon was a pell-mell of\r\nBelisarii, Télémaques, Phædras, Electras, Brutuses, Psyches, and\r\nEndymions. Girodet and Guérin wearied themselves in putting on canvas\r\nthe chief scenes in the classical tragedies at that time so frequently\r\nperformed--Pygmalion and Galatea, the Death of Agamemnon, and the\r\nlike--and painted portraits between times; Girodet's dry and poor,\r\nGuérin's solemnly vacant. The universal note was that of tedium.\r\n\r\n_François Gérard_ alone, the \"King of Painters and Painter of Kings,\"\r\nsurvives, at least in his portraits. Like David he is redeemed only by\r\nhis portrait painting, and his successes in that direction eclipse even\r\nMme. Vigée-Lebrun, the amiable, gifted, and graceful painter of Marie\r\nAntoinette's days. At the outbreak of the Revolution she had left\r\nFrance. Everywhere extolled and welcomed with open arms, she painted\r\nMme. de Staël in Switzerland, and at Naples Lady Hamilton, the famous\r\nbeauty of the time of the Directory. But when, in 1810, she returned to\r\nParis, she had been forgotten. The day on which Marie Antoinette picked\r\nup her brush for her, as Charles V had done for Titian, was to remain\r\nthe happiest in her life. She belonged to the Ancien Régime, and\r\nalthough her death did not take place till 1842, at the age of\r\neighty-seven, her work was already over in 1792. In her old age she\r\nbusied herself in writing memoirs of the splendour of her youthful days,\r\nfrom the famous mythological dinner in the Rue de Cléry, where her\r\nhusband appeared in the character of Pindar and recited his translation\r\nof Anacreon's odes, to the triumphs which accompanied her journey round\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nGérard took the place which she had left vacant at her departure, and\r\nfilled it well, especially in his youth. When, in the Exhibition of\r\nPortrait Painting held at Paris in 1885, there appeared the likeness of\r\nMlle. Brongniart, from the collection of Baron Pichon, painted by Gérard\r\nin 1795, at the age of twenty-five, there was general astonishment at\r\nthe familiar and intimate grasp of character it displayed. The portrait\r\nof this young girl standing in her white dress, so tranquil and without\r\npose, has in the firmness of its draughtsmanship the austere charm and\r\ndignity of a Bronzino. And later none could give to the aristocracy of\r\nEurope a nobler or more natural bearing than did Gérard, who became\r\ntheir tried and trusted depicter: yet in his last days he descended into\r\ntheatrical exaggeration. Endowed as he was with all the captivating\r\nqualities of a cultured man of the world, he had from the beginning\r\navoided as the plague the revolutionary politics in which David was for\r\nsome time engaged, and when at the instance of the elder master he was\r\nappointed a member of the Revolutionary Tribunal, he alleged illness in\r\norder to be absent from its sessions. He was a man of the salons, the\r\nborn painter of the great world, his house the centre of a distinguished\r\ncircle of society. Not a celebrity, not an emperor or king, but wished\r\nto be painted by Gérard. And just as he had been the chosen portrait\r\npainter of the Bonaparte family, so after the Restoration he was still\r\nthe official favourite of the Court. Josephine took the fashionable\r\npainter under her high protection, Napoleon's marshals defiled before\r\nhim, and the aristocracy which returned with Louis XVIII vied with one\r\nanother for his favour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANÇOIS GÉRARD.   _L'Art._]\r\n\r\nGérard's three hundred portraits are a continuous catalogue of all those\r\nwho in the first quarter of the century played any part in France upon\r\nthe political, military, or literary stage. A man of supple talent and\r\nfine tastes, he completely satisfied the desires of a society which,\r\nafter the storm of the Revolution, opened its salons again and\r\nre-established its former hierarchy of rank. The portrait with rich\r\nbackground of upholstery, and the depicting of public ceremonies, were\r\nreintroduced by him into the field of art. The people whom he painted\r\nare no longer \"citizens,\" as with David, but princes, generals,\r\nprincesses; and their surroundings allow of no doubt as to whether they\r\nare to be addressed as Sir, as Your Serene Highness, or as Your\r\nExcellency. No one knew how to flatter in so tactful a manner,\r\nparticularly in portraits of ladies. It was to him, therefore, that Mme.\r\nRécamier had recourse when she was dissatisfied with David's likeness of\r\nher. Gérard's, which she destined for Prince Augustus of Prussia, one of\r\nher admirers, gave the \"fair Juliette\" the fullest satisfaction. In the\r\nformer she was represented reposing on a couch, austere and without\r\ncharm, like a tragic muse. Here she sits in a pleasant, lazy attitude\r\nupon a chair, in a transparent robe which fully displays her form; about\r\nher lips plays a half-melancholy, half-coquettish smile, and she, the\r\ngreat actress who had turned so many men's heads, gazes with gentle\r\nchild-eyes as innocently upon the world as though she believed the story\r\nabout babies and the stork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  GÉRARD.   MLLE. BRONGNIART.]\r\n\r\nThe background, too, that colonnade \"leading nowhither,\" is\r\ncharacteristic of the change in the manner of regarding things. The\r\nolder schools of painting had, in the case of portraits, managed the\r\ntreatment of the background in two different ways. The old Dutch and\r\nGermans--Jan van Eyck and Holbein--aimed at showing a man, not only\r\nportrayed with the subtlest fidelity to truth, but also in the\r\nsurroundings in which he was usually or by preference to be found. The\r\nItalians renounced all representation of such scenes, and gave only a\r\nquiet, neutral tone to the background. Gorgeous decorative scenery was\r\nintroduced by the court painter Van Dyck, and since the second half of\r\nthe seventeenth century had continually risen in popular favour.\r\nMignard, Lebrun, and Rigaud had brought into fashion, for portraits of\r\nprincely personages, that stately pillared architecture, with broad\r\nvelvet curtains swelling and descending in ample folds, which at that\r\ntime was so remarkably in keeping with the whole cut of the costumes,\r\nwith the enormous full-bodied wigs and the theatrical attitudinising of\r\nthat epoch. For the likenesses of generals and warlike princes the\r\nfavourite background was one which represented, by means of a number of\r\nsmall figures, entire battles, marches, sieges, and so forth. Both these\r\nmethods, and, together with them, that of an ideal, lightly indicated\r\npark landscape, were put an end to by the Revolution, under the\r\ninfluence of which all extravagant pomp, not only in life, but even in\r\nportrait painting, was replaced by an ascetic sobriety. Gérard, the\r\nCourt painter of the Bourbons, who on their return had \"learnt nothing\r\nand forgotten nothing,\" reintroduced the gorgeous pillar decoration,\r\nwhich still remained the authoritative style under Stieler and\r\nWinterhalter, and has only in the _bourgeois_ era of to-day given way to\r\nthe simple, neutral-toned background of the Italians.\r\n\r\nDavid, by the way, never forgave Mme. Récamier for having preferred his\r\npupil to himself. When, in 1805, after the completion of Gérard's\r\nlikeness of her, she approached David on the subject of finishing his,\r\nhe answered drily: \"Madame, artists have their caprices as well as\r\nwomen; now it is _I_ who will not.\"\r\n\r\nAs an historical painter Gérard was an imitator of the mannerist\r\nGirodet. Paintings such as \"Daphnis and Chloe,\" or the famous \"Psyche\"\r\nreceiving Cupid's first kiss (1798), made indeed a great sensation among\r\nthe ladies, who for some time afterwards painted their faces white, to\r\nresemble the gentle Psyche; but from the artistic point of view they do\r\nnot rise above the ordinary level of the Classical school. As an\r\nhistorical painter he took much the same course as David; he began as a\r\nRevolutionist in 1795 with the usual \"Belisarius,\" and ended as a\r\nRoyalist with a \"Coronation of Charles X.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  GÉRARD.   MADAME VISCONTI.]\r\n\r\nThe more stiff and sober the antique style of David became, the sooner a\r\ncounter-current was likely to arise, and the change of taste showed\r\nitself first in the circumstance that, from 1810 on, a master came more\r\nand more to the front who, already old, had hitherto lived in obscurity,\r\nalmost despised by his contemporaries. This was the amiable,\r\nsympathetic, charming, sweet, and great _Prudhon_, the lineal descendant\r\nof Correggio, a solitary painter, the gracefulness of whose art was at\r\nfirst unappreciated, but who, as the orthodox academicians began to be\r\nmore and more tedious, exercised a correspondingly greater influence\r\nover the younger generation. He is the one refreshing oasis in the\r\ndesert wilderness of the Classical school.\r\n\r\nWhat a difference between him and David! When the elegant grace of\r\nWatteau fled from the French school, and the new Spartans dreamed of\r\nfounding a Greek art, David was the hero of this buskined theatrical\r\nschool of painting. He painted \"The Horatii\" and \"Brutus,\" and thought\r\nto bring ancient Rome back to life by copying the shapes of old Roman\r\nchairs and old Roman swords. That was the antique style of his first\r\nperiod. Later, having made the discovery that, compared with the Greeks,\r\nthe Romans were semi-barbarians, he abandoned the Roman style, and\r\nthought to make a great stride forwards by copying Greek statues and\r\ncarefully transferring them to his pictures. This \"pure Grecian\r\ncharacter\" is represented in his \"Rape of the Sabines.\" Later again, he\r\nturned to the more ancient Greeks, and the result was the most academic\r\nof his pictures, his \"Leonidas.\" A mixture of dryness and declamatory\r\npathos; diligence without imagination; able draughtsmanship and an\r\nabsolute incapacity of drawing anything whatever without a model;\r\ncareful arrangement without the slightest trace of that gift of the\r\ninner vision whereby the whole is brought complete and finished before\r\nthe eye,--these exhaust the list of David's qualities. By means of\r\ncasting and copying he thought to come near to that art of the antique\r\nwhose soul he dreamed of embracing, when he held but its skeleton in his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  GÉRARD.   CUPID AND PSYCHE.]\r\n\r\nAnd meanwhile, away from the broad high-road, and almost unnoticed, was\r\nliving that painter whom David contemptuously called \"the Boucher of his\r\ntime.\" He it was who truly cherished the gods of Greece in his heart,\r\nunder whose brush the dead statues began to breathe and to feel the\r\nblood flowing in their veins, as in the old days when the Renaissance\r\ndug them out of the ground. His appearance on the stage indicates the\r\nfirst protest against the rigid system pursued by the painter of the\r\nHoratii and of Brutus. Prudhon also believed in the antique, but he saw\r\ntherein a grace which no Classicist had ever seen; he also contrasted\r\nthe simplicity of the Grecian profile with the capricious, wrinkled\r\nforms of the _rococo_ style; he too had spent his youth in Italy, but\r\nhad not thought it criminal to study Leonardo and Correggio; he did not\r\nbind himself either to cold sculpture or to the delicate _morbidezza_ of\r\nthe Lombards as the only means of grace. He remained a Frenchman heart\r\nand soul, in that he inherited from Watteau's age its womanly softness\r\nand elegance. In a cold, ascetic age he still believed in tenderness,\r\ngaiety, and laughter--he who as a man had but little reason to take\r\ndelight in life.\r\n\r\nPrudhon was ten years younger than David, and was born at Cluny, the\r\ntenth child of a poor stone cutter. He grew up in miserable\r\ncircumstances, cherished only by a mother who devoted the whole of her\r\nlove to this her youngest born, and to whom the child, a delicate pliant\r\ncreature, clung with girl-like tenderness. His parents used often to\r\nsend him out with the other poor children of the little town to gather\r\nfaggots for the winter in the wood belonging to the neighbouring\r\nBenedictine monastery. There the handsome, sprightly boy with the large\r\nmelancholy eyes attracted the notice of the priest, Père Besson, who\r\nmade him a chorister and gave him some instruction. Here, in the old\r\nabbey of Cluny, surrounded by venerable statues carved in wood, by old\r\npictures of saints and artistic miniatures, he recognised his vocation.\r\nAn inner voice told him that he was to be a painter. And now his Latin\r\nexercise books began to fill with drawings, and he carved little images\r\nwith his penknife out of wood, soap, or whatever came to his hand. He\r\nsqueezed out the juice of flowers, made brushes of horsehair, and began\r\nto paint. He was inconsolable on finding that he could not hit off the\r\ncolouring of the old church pictures. It was a revelation to him when\r\none of the monks said to him one day: \"My boy, you will never manage it\r\nso: these pictures are painted in oils\"; and he straightway invented oil\r\npainting for himself. With the help of the instruction which he now\r\nreceived at Dijon from an able painter, Devosge, he made rapid progress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  GÉRARD.   MADAME RÉCAMIER [DETAIL].]\r\n\r\nNevertheless a generation was yet to pass before he was really to become\r\na painter. His marriage, on 17th February 1778, with the daughter of the\r\nnotary of Cluny, became the torment of his life. A linen-weaver and\r\nthree of his father-in-law's clerks were present at the wedding. His\r\nwife was quarrelsome, their income small, and their family rapidly\r\nincreasing. He betook himself to Paris to seek his fortune, with a\r\nletter of introduction to the engraver Wille. \"Take pity on this\r\nyoungster, who has been married for the last three years, and who, were\r\nhe to come under some low fellow's influence, might easily fall into the\r\nmost terrible abyss\"; so ran the letter, which a certain Baron\r\nJoursanvault had given him. He hired himself a room in the house of M.\r\nFauconnier, the head of a firm engaged in the lace trade, who lived in\r\nthe Rue du Bac with his wife and a pretty sister. The latter, Marie, was\r\neighteen years of age, and, like Werther's Lotte, was always surrounded\r\nby her brother's children, whom she looked after like a little\r\nhousewife. Prudhon, himself young, sensitive, and handsome, loved and\r\nwas loved, and made her presents of small flattering portraits and\r\npretty allegorical drawings, in which Cupid was represented scratching\r\nthe initials M. F. (Marie Fauconnier) on the wall with his arrow. That\r\nhe was married and several times a father she never knew, till one day\r\nMadame Prudhon arrived with the children. \"And you never told me!\" was\r\nher only word of reproach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  PIERRE PAUL PRUDHON.   PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF.]\r\n\r\nPrudhon himself now went to Italy--a journey accompanied by serious\r\ndifficulties. At Dijon he had competed for the Prix de Rome, and had\r\nbeen so simple as to make a sketch for one of his rivals. He owed it to\r\nthe latter's honesty that the scholarship nevertheless fell to himself.\r\nHe started on his journey; but when he reached Marseilles, and was ready\r\nto embark, the vessel was unable to weigh anchor for several weeks,\r\nowing to stormy weather. And even on the voyage it became necessary to\r\ndisembark again, so that months had elapsed before he arrived in Rome,\r\npenniless, and having embraced, according to classical custom, the land\r\nhe had come to conquer; for he had fallen out of the carriage on the\r\nway. Fortunately his dearly bought sojourn in Italy did him no harm. He\r\nhad indeed intended to draw only from the antique and after Raphael; but\r\nafter the lapse of a very few weeks he found his ideal in Leonardo. Him\r\nhe calls \"his Master and Hero, the inimitable father and prince of all\r\npainters, in artistic power far surpassing Raphael!\"\r\n\r\nIn a small sketch-book, half torn up, dating from this time, and still\r\nin existence, we have already the whole Prudhon. It contains copies of\r\nancient statues, made laboriously and without pleasure in the work; then\r\ncomes Correggio's disarmed \"Cupid,\" a delicious little sketch, and with\r\nthe same pencil that drew it he has written down the names of the\r\npictures he purposes painting later on: \"Love,\" \"Frivolity,\" \"Cupid and\r\nPsyche.\" It is as it were the secret confession of his fantasy, a\r\npreliminary announcement of his future works. Here and there are found\r\nsketches hastily dashed off of beautiful female forms in the graceful\r\nattitude which had excited his admiration in the women of the\r\n\"Aldobrandini Wedding.\" But, above all, the young artist observed all\r\nthat was around him. He lived in unceasing intercourse with the\r\nbeautiful, and his soul was nurtured by the spirit of the works which\r\nsurrounded him. He accumulated pictures, not in his sketch-book, but in\r\nhimself; so much so that, when he was afterwards interrogated as to his\r\nItalian studies, his only answer was: \"I did nothing but study life and\r\nadmire the works of the masters.\" He avoided association even with\r\nscholars who had taken the Prix de Rome. The elegant and graceful\r\nsculptor Canova was the only one with whom he permitted himself any\r\nintercourse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  PRUDHON.   JOSEPH AND POTIPHAR'S WIFE.]\r\n\r\nWhen his scholarship had run its course, at the end of November 1789, he\r\nfound himself again in Paris, and the struggle against poverty began\r\nonce more. Even while in Italy he had sent all his savings to his wife,\r\nwho had straightway squandered them in drink with her brother, a\r\nsergeant in a cavalry regiment. At Paris he had to act as parlour-maid\r\nand nursery-maid. The faces of two more women rise up in his life like\r\nfleeting stars, and both of them died before his eyes. The first was the\r\nmysterious stranger who appeared one day in his studio and commissioned\r\nhim to paint her portrait. She was young, scarcely twenty years of age,\r\nwith great blue eyes, but her face was weary and wan as though from long\r\nsleepless nights. \"Your portrait?\" asked Prudhon, \"with features so\r\ntroubled and sad?\" He set to work, silent and indifferent; but with\r\nevery stroke of his brush he felt himself more mystically attracted to\r\nthis young girl, evidently as unhappy and as persecuted by fate as\r\nhimself. She promised to return on the morrow; but neither on that day\r\nnor on the next did she appear. One afternoon he was wandering dreamily\r\nalong the street, thinking of the unknown fair one, when his eye almost\r\nmechanically caught sight of the guillotine, and he recognised in the\r\nunhappy victim at that very moment ending her days the mysterious\r\nvisitor of his studio.\r\n\r\nTo keep the wolf from the door, Prudhon was obliged for some years to\r\ndraw vignettes on letter-sheets for the Government offices, business\r\ncards for tradesmen, and even little pictures for _bonbonnières_. For\r\nthis the representatives of high art held him in contempt. Greuze alone\r\ntreated him amicably, and even he held out no hopes for his future. \"You\r\nhave a family and you have talent, young man; that is enough in these\r\ndays to bring about one's death by starvation. Look at my cuffs.\" Then\r\nthe old man would show him his torn shirt-sleeves--for even he could no\r\nlonger find means of getting on in the new order of things. To his\r\nanxieties about the necessities of life were added dissensions with his\r\nwife. He became the prey of a continual melancholy; he was never seen to\r\nsmile. Even when a separation had been effected his tormentor persecuted\r\nhim still, until she was relegated to a madhouse. But now a change comes\r\nover the scene with the entrance of Constance Mayer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRUDHON.   STUDY DIRECTS THE FLIGHT OF GENIUS.]\r\n\r\nThis amiable young painter, his pupil, was the star that lighted up his\r\nold age. She was ugly. With her brown complexion, her broad flat nose,\r\nand her large mouth, she had at first sight the appearance of a mulatto.\r\nYet to this large mouth belonged voluptuous lips ever ready to be\r\nkissed; above this broad nose there were two eyes shining like black\r\ndiamonds, which by their changeful expression made this irregular,\r\n_gamin's_ face appear positively beautiful. She was seventeen years his\r\njunior, and he has painted her as often as Rembrandt painted his Saskia.\r\nHe has immortalised the dainty upturned nose of his little gipsy, as he\r\ncalled her, in pictures, sketches, pastels, all of which have the same\r\npiquant charm, the same elegant grace, the same joyous and merry\r\nexpression. In her he had found his type, as his namesake Rubens did in\r\nHélène Fourment. Constance Mayer became the muse of his delicate,\r\ngraceful work. And she too died before his eyes, having cut her throat\r\nwith a razor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRUDHON.   LE COUP DE PATTE DU CHAT.]\r\n\r\nThe master and the pupil loved each other. As sentimental as she was\r\npassionate, as gay as she was piquant, nervous and witty, she possessed\r\nevery quality that was likely to captivate him, as she chattered to him\r\nin her lively and original way, and flattered his pride as an artist.\r\nThis love seemed to promise him rest and a bright ending for his days.\r\nHe entered into it with the passion of a young man in love for the first\r\ntime. Mlle. Mayer, after her father's death, was dependent on no one.\r\nHer studio in the Sorbonne was separated from her master's only by a\r\nblind wall. She was with him the entire day, worked at his side, was his\r\nhousekeeper, and saw to the education of his daughter, to whom she was\r\nat once a mother and an elder sister; and Prudhon transferred to her all\r\nthe tender love which as a child he had cherished for his mother. In his\r\ngratitude he wished to share his genius with his friend, and to make her\r\nfamous like himself. It is pathetic to note in Mlle. Mayer's studies\r\nwith what patience and devotion he instructed her, how he strove to\r\nanimate her with his own spirit, and to give her something of his own\r\nimmortality. Even his own work was influenced by the new happiness. To\r\nthe period of his connection with Constance belong his masterpieces,\r\n\"Justice and Vengeance,\" \"The Rape of Psyche,\" \"Venus and Adonis,\" and\r\n\"The Swinging Zephyr.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRUDHON.   CUPID AND PSYCHE.]\r\n\r\nThese brought him at last even outward success. In 1808 the Emperor gave\r\nhim the Cross of the Legion of Honour for his picture of \"Justice and\r\nVengeance,\" and he became, if not the official, at least the familiar\r\npainter of the Court. The fine portrait of the Empress Josephine\r\nbelongs to this period. When the new Empress Marie Louise wished to\r\nlearn the art of painting, Prudhon, in 1811, became her drawing master;\r\nand when on the birth of the King of Rome the city of Paris presented to\r\nthe Emperor the furniture for a room, he was commissioned to provide the\r\nartistic decoration. Criticism began to bow its head when his name was\r\nmentioned; and the younger generation of painters soon discovered in\r\nhim, once so contemptuously reviled, the founder of a new religion, the\r\nwant of which had long been felt. He began to make money. Constance\r\nMayer seemed to bring him luck: her death affected him all the more\r\ndeeply.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONSTANCE MAYER.]\r\n\r\nBy nature nervous and highly strung, jealous and keenly conscious of her\r\nequivocal position, she could not make up her mind, when the painters\r\nwere ordered to move their studios from the Sorbonne, either to leave\r\nPrudhon or openly to live with him. On the morning of 26th March 1821\r\nshe left her model, the little Sophie, alone, after giving her a ring.\r\nSoon afterwards a heavy fall was heard, and she was found lying on the\r\nground in a pool of blood. Prudhon lingered on for two years more, two\r\nlong years spent as it were in exile. Solitary, tortured by remorse of\r\nconscience, and with continual thoughts of suicide, he lived on only for\r\nhis recollections of her, in tender converse with the memorials she had\r\nleft, insensible to the renown which began gradually to gather round his\r\nname. The completion of the \"Unfortunate Family,\" which Constance had\r\nleft unfinished on her easel, was his last _tête-à-tête_ with her, his\r\nlast farewell. He left his studio only to visit her grave in\r\nPère-Lachaise, or to wander alone along the outer boulevards. An\r\n\"Ascension of the Virgin\" and a \"Christ on the Cross\" were the last\r\nworks of the once joyous painter of ancient mythology: the Mater\r\nDolorosa and the Crucified--symbols of his own torments. Death at length\r\ntook compassion upon him. On the 16th of February 1823 France lost\r\nPrudhon.\r\n\r\nHis art was the pure expression of his spiritual life. His life was\r\nswayed by women, and something feminine breathes through all his\r\npictures. In them there speaks a man full of soul, originally of a\r\njoyous nature, who has gone through experiences which prevented him ever\r\nbeing joyous again. He has inherited from the _rococo_ style its graces\r\nand its little Cupids, but has also already tasted of all the melancholy\r\nof the new age. With his smiles there is mingled a secret sadness. He\r\nhas learnt that life is not an unending banquet and a perpetual\r\npleasure; he has seen how tragic a morrow follows upon the voyage to\r\nthe Isle of Cythera. The bloom has faded from his pale cheeks, his brow\r\nis furrowed--he has seen the guillotine. He, the last _rococo_ painter\r\nand the first Romanticist, would have been truly the man to effect the\r\ntransition from the eighteenth to the nineteenth century by a path more\r\nnatural than that followed by David.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  CONSTANCE MAYER.   THE DREAM OF HAPPINESS.]\r\n\r\nEven his fugitive sketches, thrown off in the days of his poverty, have\r\na quite peculiar charm and a thoroughly individual sentiment. There are\r\nvignettes of his for letter-sheets, done for the Government offices,\r\nwhich in a few pencil touches contain more manly elegance and poetry\r\nthan do David's most pretentious compositions with all their borrowed\r\nClassicism. Prudhon was the only painter who at that time produced\r\nanything of conspicuous merit in the art of ornament. Even drawings such\r\nas \"Minerva uniting Law and Liberty,\" which from their titles would lead\r\none to expect nothing more than frozen allegories, are imbued, not with\r\nDavid's coldness, but with Correggio's charm. French grace and elegance\r\nare united, without constraint, to the beauty of line found in ancient\r\ncameos. He it was who first felt again the living poetry of that old\r\nmythology, which had become a mere collection of dry names. He is\r\ncommissioned to draw a card of invitation for a ball, and he sends a\r\ntender hymn on music and dancing. In extravagant profusion he scatters\r\nforth, no matter where, poetic invention and grace such as David in his\r\nmost strenuous efforts sought for in vain. It was during this time that\r\nPrudhon became the admirable draughtsman to whom the French school have\r\nawarded a place among their greatest masters. These drawings and\r\nillustrations were the necessary preparation for the great works which\r\nbrought him to the front at the beginning of the century.\r\n\r\nEven his first picture, painted in 1799--to-day half-destroyed--\"Wisdom\r\nbringing Truth upon the earth, at whose approach Darkness vanishes,\"\r\nmust, to judge from early descriptions, have been marked by a seductive\r\nand delicate grace. And the celebrated work of 1808, \"Justice and\r\nVengeance pursuing Crime,\" belongs certainly, so far as colouring is\r\nconcerned, rather to the Romantic than to the Classical era. For during\r\nthe latter, one faculty especially had been lost, and that was the art\r\nof painting flesh. Prudhon, by deep study of Leonardo and Correggio,\r\nmasters at that time completely out of fashion, won back this capacity\r\nfor the French school. In wild and desolate scenery, above which the\r\nmoon, emerging from behind heavy clouds, shines with a ghostly light\r\nupon the bare rocks, the murderer is leaving the body of his victim. He\r\nstrides forth with hasty steps, purse and dagger in hand, glancing back\r\nwith a shudder at the naked corpse of a young man which has fallen upon\r\na ledge of rock, lying there stiff and with outstretched arms. Above,\r\nlike shapes in the clouds, the avenging goddesses are already sweeping\r\ndownwards upon him. Justice pursues the fugitive with threatening,\r\nwrathful glance; while Vengeance, lighting the way with her torch,\r\nstretches out her hand to grasp the guilty one. In that epoch this\r\npicture stands alone for the imposing characterisation of the persons,\r\nfor its powerful pictorial execution, and the stern and grandiose\r\nlandscape which serves as setting to the awful scene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  THE TOMB OF PRUDHON AND CONSTANCE MAYER AT PÈRE-LACHAISE.]\r\n\r\nIn general, Prudhon was not a tragic painter; his preference was for the\r\nmore joyous, light and dreamy, delicately veiled myths of the ancients.\r\nHis misfortunes taught him to flee from reality, and on the wings of Art\r\nhe saved himself, in the realm of legendary love and visionary\r\nhappiness. So we see Psyche borne aloft by Zephyr through the twilight\r\nto the nuptial abode of Eros. A soft light falls upon her snowy body;\r\nher head has fallen upon her shoulder, and one arm, bent backwards,\r\nenframes her face. Silent like a cloud, the group moves onward--a\r\nsweet-scented apparition from fairyland. Now, enraptured genii visit the\r\nslumbering Fair One in forest-shadows, under the shimmering moon; now\r\nshe is stealing secretly down to bathe in a tranquil lake, and gazes\r\nwith astonishment upon her own likeness in the gloomy mirror. Here\r\nVenus, drawing deep breaths of secret bliss, is seated, full of longing\r\nlove, by the side of Adonis. Who else, at that time, could draw nude\r\nfigures of such faultless beauty, so slender and pure, with lines so\r\nsupple and yet so firm, and enveloped in so full and soft a light? Or\r\nagain, he paints Zephyr swinging roguishly by the side of a stream. A\r\ngentle breeze plays through his locks, and the cool darkness of the wood\r\nbreathes through all things round.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  PRUDHON.   THE UNFORTUNATE FAMILY.]\r\n\r\nPrudhon's work is never a laborious patchwork of fragments of antique\r\nforms picked up here and there, never the insipid product of the reason\r\nworking in accordance with recipes long handed down; it is thoroughly\r\nintuitive. Never keeping too closely to his model, he gave to his\r\ncreations the movement and the divine breath of life. In his hands with\r\ndreamlike fidelity the Antique rose up again renewed, new in the sense\r\nof his own completely modern sentiment, and in that of those great\r\nmasters of the Renaissance who had wakened it to life three hundred\r\nyears before. For Prudhon, as is shown by his landscape backgrounds, is\r\naltogether Jean Jacques Rousseau's contemporary, the child of that epoch\r\nin which Nature revealed itself anew; and, as is proved by his figures,\r\nhe is a congenial spirit to Antonio da Allegri and Vinci. In fresh\r\nrecollection of Correggio, he loves a soft exuberance of flesh and a\r\ndelicate semi-obscurity; in enthusiastic reverence for Leonardo, those\r\nheads of women, with deep, sensuously veiled eyes, and that mysterious\r\ndelicate smile playing dreamily round the wanton mouth. Only, the\r\nenchanting sweetness of the Florentine and the delicious ecstasy of the\r\nLombard are toned down by a gentle melancholy which is entirely modern.\r\nThe Psyche borne up to heaven by Zephyr changes in the end, when\r\npurified and refined, into the soul itself, which, in the form of the\r\nMadonna, ascends into heaven, transfigured with longing desire; and\r\nVenus, the goddess of love, is transformed into Love immortal, \"Who,\r\nstretched upon the Cross, yet reacheth out His hand to thee.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRUDHON.   THE RAPE OF PSYCHE.]\r\n\r\nThis man, with his soft tenderness and fine feeling for the eternal\r\nfeminine, was as though fashioned by Nature to be the painter of women\r\nof his time. If David was the chief depicter of male faces bearing a\r\nstrong impress of character, delicate, refined, womanly natures found\r\ntheir best interpreter in Prudhon. His heads of women charm one by the\r\nmysterious language of their eyes, by their familiar smile, and by their\r\ndreamy melancholy. No one knew better how to catch the fleeting\r\nexpression in its most delicate shades, how to grasp the very mood of\r\nthe moment. How piquant is his smiling Antoinette Leroux with her dress\r\n_à la_ Charlotte Corday, her coquettish extravagant hat, and all the\r\namusing \"chic\" of her toilette! Madame Copia, the wife of the engraver,\r\nwith her delicately veiled eyes, has become in Prudhon's hands the very\r\nessence of a beautiful soul. A languishing weariness, a remarkable\r\nmingling of Creole grace and gentle melancholy, breathes over the\r\nportrait of the Empress Josephine. She is represented seated on a grassy\r\nbank in a dignified yet negligent attitude, her head slightly bent, her\r\ngaze wandering afar with a look of uncertain inquiry, as though she had\r\nsome faint presentiment of her coming misfortune; and the dreamy\r\ntwilight-shadows of a mysterious landscape are gathering around her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRUDHON.   LE MIDI.]\r\n\r\nComing after a period of colour asceticism, Prudhon was the first to\r\nshow a fine feeling for colour. Even during the revolutionary era he\r\nprotested in the name of the graceful against David's formal stiffness.\r\nHe sought to demonstrate that human beings do not in truth differ very\r\nwidely to-day from those in whom Leonardo and Correggio delighted, that\r\nthey are fashioned out of delicate flesh and blood, not out of marble\r\nand stone. Standing beside David, he appealed to the art of colour. But\r\nas with André Chénier, a spirit congenial to his, it was long before he\r\nattained success. His modesty and his rustic character could effect\r\nnothing against the dictatorial power of David, on whom had been\r\nshowered every dignity that Art could offer. People continued to\r\nridicule poor Prudhon, who worked only after his own fantasy, who had\r\nfashioned for himself in _chiaroscuro_ a poetic language of his own,\r\ntill the question was raised again from another side, and this time by a\r\nyoung man who came directly out of David's studio.\r\n\r\n_Antoine Jean Gros_ was one of David's pupils, and stood out among his\r\nfellows as the one most submissively devoted to his master; yet it was\r\nhe who, without wishing it or knowing of it, was preparing the way for\r\nthe overthrow of David's school. He was born 17th March 1771, at Paris,\r\nwhere his father was a miniature painter. His vocation was determined\r\nin the studio of Mme. Vigée-Lebrun, who was a friend of his parents. In\r\nthe Salon of 1785, which contained David's \"Andromache beside the Body\r\nof Hector,\" he chose his instructor. He was then the handsome youth of\r\nfifteen represented in his portrait of himself at Versailles, with\r\ndelicate features, full of feeling, on which lies an amiable, gentle\r\ncast of sentimentality. Two large, dark-brown eyes look out upon the\r\nworld astonished and inquiring, dark hair surrounds the quiet, fresh\r\nface, and over it is cocked a broad-brimmed felt hat. In this picture we\r\nsee a fine-strung, sensitive nature, a soul which would be plunged by\r\nbitter experiences into depths of despair, in proportion as success\r\nwould raise it to heights of ecstasy. In 1792 he competed unsuccessfully\r\nfor the Prix de Rome, and this failure was the making of him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRUDHON.   LA NUIT.]\r\n\r\nHe went to Italy on his own account, and was an eye-witness of the war\r\nwhich Napoleon was there waging. There he beheld scenes in which\r\narchæology had no part. For when Augereau's foot-soldiers carried the\r\nbridge of Arcola by assault, they had little thought of imitating an\r\nantique bas-relief. Gros observed armies on the march, and saw their\r\ntriumphant entry into festally decorated cities. He learnt his lesson on\r\nthe field of battle, and on his return placed on record what he had\r\nhimself gone through. In Italy he caught the poetry of modern life, and\r\nat the same time was enabled as a painter to supplement David's lectures\r\nwith the teaching of another surpassing master. It was in Genoa that he\r\nbecame acquainted with Rubens. As Prudhon's originality consisted in the\r\nfact that he was the first of that period again to stand dreaming before\r\nLeonardo and Correggio, so did Gros' lie in this, that he studied\r\nRubens at a time when the Antwerp master was also completely out of\r\nfashion. His instinct as a painter had at the very commencement guided\r\nhim to Rubens' \"St. Ignatius,\" which in his letters he described as a\r\n\"sublime and magnificent work.\" When he was subsequently appointed a\r\nmember of the Commission charged with the transference of works of art\r\nto Paris, he had abundant opportunities of admiring critically the works\r\nof the sixteenth and seventeenth century masters. The two impressions\r\nthus received had a decisive effect upon his life. Gros became the great\r\ncolourist of the Classical school, the singer of the Napoleonic epos.\r\nCompared with David's marmoreal Græco-Romans, Gros' figures seem to\r\nbelong to another world; his pictures speak, both in purport and in\r\ntechnique, a language which must more than once have astonished his\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRUDHON.   L'ENJOUIR.]\r\n\r\nHe was fortunate enough to be presented to Josephine Beauharnais, and\r\nthrough her to Bonaparte, in the Casa Serbelloni at Milan; and Gros,\r\nwhose earnest desire it was to paint the great commander, was appointed\r\na lieutenant on his staff. He had occasion, in the three days' battle of\r\nArcola, to admire the Dictator's impetuous heroism; and he made a sketch\r\nof the General storming the bridge of Arcola at the head of his troops,\r\nensign in hand. It pleased Napoleon, who saw in it something of the\r\ndæmonic power of the future conqueror of the world; and when the picture\r\nwas exhibited in Paris in 1801 it met there also with the most striking\r\nsuccess. The greater warmth of colour, the broader sweep of the brush,\r\nand the life-like movement of the figures seemed, in comparison with\r\nDavid's monotonous manner, to be far-reaching innovations.\r\n\r\nWith his \"Napoleon on the Bridge of Arcola\" Gros had found his peculiar\r\ntalent. What his teacher had accomplished as painter to the Convention,\r\nGros carried to a conclusion in that span of time during which Napoleon\r\nlived in the minds of his people as a hero. He too made an occasional\r\nexcursion into the domain of Greek mythology, but he did not feel at\r\nhome there. His field was that living history which the generals and\r\nsoldiers of France were making. He won for contemporary military life\r\nits citizenship in art. David, wishing to remain true to \"history\" and\r\nto \"style,\" had depicted contemporary events with reluctance. What\r\nGérard and Girodet had produced was interesting as a protest on the part\r\nof reality against classical convention, but on the whole it was\r\nunsatisfying and wearisome. Gros, the famous painter of the \"Plague of\r\nJaffa\" and of the \"Battle of Eylau,\" was the first to attain to high\r\nrenown in this field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRUDHON.   MARGUERITE.]\r\n\r\nThese are two powerful and genuine pictures, two pre-eminent works which\r\nwill endure. Gros stands far above David and all his rivals in his power\r\nof perception. The elder painter is now out of date, while Gros remains\r\never fresh, because he painted under the impulse given by real events,\r\nand not under the ban of empty theories. A realist through and through,\r\nhe did not shrink from representing the horrible, which antique art\r\npreferred to avoid. In an epoch when Rome and Greece were the only\r\nsources of inspiration he had the courage to paint a hospital, with its\r\nsick, its dying, and its dead. When in the Egypto-Syrian campaign the\r\nplague broke out after the storming of Jaffa, Napoleon, accompanied by a\r\nfew of his officers, undertook, on 7th March 1799, to visit the victims\r\nof the pestilence. This act deserved to be celebrated in a commemorative\r\npicture. Gros took it in hand, and represented Napoleon, in the\r\ncharacter of consoler, amid the agonising torments of the dying;\r\ndeviating from historical accuracy only so far as to transfer the scene\r\nfrom the wretched wards of the lazaretto to the courtyard of a pillared\r\nmosque. In the shadows of the airy halls sick and wounded men twist and\r\nwrithe, stare before them in despair, rear themselves up half-naked in\r\nmortal pain, or turn to gaze upon the Commander-in-Chief, a splendid\r\napparition full of youthful power, who is tranquilly feeling the plague\r\nboils of one of their comrades. Here and there Orientals move in\r\npicturesque costumes, distributing the food which negro lads are\r\nbringing in. And beyond, over the battlements of the Moorish arcades,\r\none sees the town with its fortifications, its flat roofs and slender\r\nminarets, over which flutter the victorious banners of the French. On\r\none side lies the distant, glittering blue sea, and over all stretches\r\nthe clear, glowing southern sky.\r\n\r\nLike a new gospel, like the first gust of wind preceding the storm of\r\nRomanticism, this picture standing in the Louvre, surrounded by its\r\nstiff Classical contemporaries, excites a sensation of pleasure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRUDHON.   LES PETITS DÉVIDEURS.]\r\n\r\nGros' heroes know, as David's do, that they are important, and show it\r\nperhaps too much, but at least they act. The painter felt what he was\r\npainting, and an impulse of human love, an heroic and yet human life,\r\npermeates the picture. Moreover, Gros did not content himself with the\r\nscanty palette and the miserable cartoon-draughtsmanship of his\r\ncontemporaries. This treatment of the nude, these despairing heads of\r\ndying men, show none of the stony lifelessness of the Classical school;\r\nthis Moorish courtyard has no resemblance to the tragedy peristyle so\r\nhabitually employed up to that time; this Bonaparte laying his hand upon\r\nthe dying man's sores is no Greek or Roman hero. The sick men whose\r\nfeverish eyes gaze upon him as on the star of hope, the negroes going up\r\nand down with viands, are no mere supernumeraries; the sea lying in\r\nsunshine beyond, full of bustling sails, and the harbour gaily decked\r\nwith many-coloured flags, point in their joyous splendour of colouring\r\nto the dawn of a new era. The young artists were not mistaken when, in\r\nthe Salon of 1804, they fastened a sprig of laurel to the frame of the\r\npicture. The State bought it for sixteen thousand francs. A banquet at\r\nwhich Vien and David presided was given in honour of the painter.\r\nGirodet read a poem, of which the conclusion ran as follows--\r\n\r\n  \"Et toi, sage Vien, toi, David, maître illustre,\r\n   Jouissez de vos succès; dans son sixième lustre,\r\n   Votre élève, déjà de toutes parts cité,\r\n   Auprès de vous vivra dans la postérité.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRUDHON.   THE VINTAGE.]\r\n\r\nIn his \"Battle of Eylau,\" exhibited in 1808, Gros has given us a\r\ncompanion picture to the \"Plague of Jaffa\": in one a visit to a\r\nhospital, in the other the inspection of a field of battle after the\r\nfight is over. The dismal grey hue of winter rests upon the white sheet\r\nof snow stretching desolately away to the horizon, only interrupted here\r\nand there by hillocks beneath which annihilated regiments sleep their\r\nlast sleep. In the foreground lie dead bodies heaped together, and\r\nmoaning wounded men; and in the midst of this horror of mangled limbs\r\nand corrupting flesh he, the Conqueror, the Master, the Emperor, comes\r\nto a halt, pale, his eyes turned towards the cities burning on the\r\nhorizon, in his grey overcoat and small cocked hat, at the head of his\r\nstaff, indifferent, inexorable, merciless as Fate. \"_Ah! si les rois\r\npouvaient contempler ce spectacle, ils scraient moins avides de\r\nconquêtes._\" The classical posturing which still lingered, a disturbing\r\nelement, in the Plague picture, has been put aside completely. The\r\nconventional horse from the frieze of the Parthenon, which David alone\r\nknew, has given way to the accurately observed animal, and the colouring\r\ntoo, in its sad harmony, has fully recovered its ancient right of giving\r\ncharacter to the picture. It was, beyond all controversy, the chief work\r\nin the Salon of 1808, rich in remarkable pictures; neither Gérard's\r\n\"Battle of Austerlitz,\" nor Girodet's \"Atala,\" nor David's Coronation\r\npiece endangered Gros' right to the first place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRUDHON.   THE VIRGIN.]\r\n\r\n\"Napoleon before the Pyramids,\" at the moment when he cries, \"Soldiers,\r\nfrom the summit of those monuments forty centuries contemplate your\r\nactions,\" constitutes, in 1810, the coping-stone of the cycle. Gros\r\nalone at that time understood the epic grandeur of war. He became, also,\r\nthe portrait painter of the great men from whom its events proceeded.\r\nHis picture of General Masséna, with its meditative, slily tenacious\r\nexpression, is the genuine portrait of a warrior; and how well is\r\nheroic, simple daring depicted in the likeness of General Lasalle,\r\nwithout the commonplace device of a mantle puffed out by the wind! His\r\nportrait of General Fournier Sarlovèse, at Versailles, has a freshness\r\nof colouring, the secret of which no one else possessed in those days\r\nexcept the two Englishmen, Lawrence and Raeburn. Gros was far in advance\r\nof his age. A painter of movement rather than of psychological analysis,\r\nhe brought out character by means of general effect, and gave the\r\nessentials in a masterly way. His portraits, just as much as his\r\nhistorical pictures, have a stormy exposition. In David all is\r\ncalculation; in Gros, fire. Almost alone among his contemporaries, he\r\nhad studied Rubens, and like him gave colour the place due to it. At\r\ntimes there is in his pictures a natural flesh-colour and an animation\r\nwhich make this warm-hearted man, who has not been sufficiently\r\nappreciated, a genuine forerunner of the moderns. Surrounded as he was\r\nby orthodox Classicists, he cried in a loud voice what Prudhon had\r\nalready ventured to say more timidly: \"Man is not a statue--not made of\r\nmarble, but of flesh and bone.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRUDHON.   CHRIST CRUCIFIED.]\r\n\r\nBut as with Prudhon, so with Gros. This man, of exaggerated nervousness,\r\nwas lacking in that capacity for persistence which belongs to a strong\r\nwill conscious of its aim; he lacked confidence in himself and in the\r\ninitiative he had taken. So long as the great figure of Napoleon kept\r\nhis head above water he was an artist; but when his hero was taken from\r\nhim he sank. The Empire had made Gros great, its fall killed him. The\r\nincubus of David's antique manner began once more to press upon him, and\r\nwhen David after his banishment (in 1816) committed to him the\r\nmanagement of his studio in Paris, Gros undertook the office with pious\r\neagerness, on nothing more anxiously intent than as a teacher once more\r\nto impose the fetters of the antique upon that Art which he had set free\r\nby his own works. \"It is not I who am speaking to you,\" he would say to\r\nthe pupils, \"but David, David, always David.\" The latter had blamed him\r\nfor having taken the trouble to paint the battles of the Empire,\r\n\"worthless occasional pieces,\" instead of venturing upon those of\r\nAlexander the Great, and thus producing genuine \"historical works.\"\r\n\"Posterity requires of you good pictures out of ancient history. Who,\r\nshe will cry, was better fitted to paint Themistocles? Quick, my friend!\r\nturn to your Plutarch.\" To depict contemporary life, which lies open\r\nbefore our eyes, was, he held, merely the business of minor artists,\r\nunworthy the brush of an \"historical painter.\" And Gros, who reverenced\r\nhis master, was so weak as to listen to his advice: he believed in him\r\nrather than in his own genius, in the strength of others rather than his\r\nown. He searched his Plutarch, and painted nothing more without a\r\nprevious side-glance towards Brussels; introduced allegory into his\r\n\"Battle of the Pyramids\"; composed in homage to David a \"Death of\r\nSappho\"; and painted the cupola of the Pantheon with stiff frescoes;\r\nwhile between times, when he looked Nature in the face, he was now and\r\nthen producing veritable masterpieces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  PRUDHON.   MADAME COPIA.]\r\n\r\nHis \"Flight of Louis XVIII\" in the Museum at Versailles, shows him once\r\nmore at his former height. It is \"one of the finest of modern works,\" as\r\nDelacroix called it in 1848, in an essay contributed to the _Revue des\r\nDeux Mondes_; at once familiar and serious. Napoleon had left Elba,\r\nmarched on Paris, and had reached Fontainebleau, when, in the night of\r\nthe 19th-20th March 1815, Louis XVIII determined to evacuate the\r\nTuileries with all speed. Accompanied by a few faithful followers and by\r\nthe officers of his personal service, he abandons his palace and takes\r\nleave of the National Guards. There is something pathetic in this\r\nsexagenarian with his erudite Bourbon profile, immortalised in the large\r\nfive-franc pieces of his reign, with his protruding stomach and small\r\nthick legs, looking like a dropsical patient going to hospital. His\r\nbearing is most unkingly. Gros has boldly depicted the scene, even to\r\nthe pathological appearance of the king, just as he saw it, forgetting\r\nall that he knew of antique art. He had himself seen the staircase, the\r\nmurmuring crowd, the lackeys hurrying by, lantern in hand, at their\r\nwits' end, and the fat, gouty king, who in his terror has forgotten all\r\nkingly dignity.\r\n\r\nThat was an historical picture, and yet as he painted it he reproached\r\nhimself anew for having forsaken the \"real art of historical painting.\"\r\nAt the funeral of Girodet in 1824 the members of the Institute talked of\r\ntheir \"irreparable loss,\" and of the necessity of finding a new leader\r\nfor the school who should avert with a strong hand that destruction\r\nwhich hot-headed young men threatened to bring upon it. \"You, Gros,\"\r\nobserved one of them, \"should be the man for the place.\" And Gros\r\nanswered, in absolute despair; \"Why, I have not only no authority as\r\nleader of a school, but, over and above that, I have to accuse myself of\r\ngiving the first bad example of defection from real art.\" The more he\r\nthought of David, the more he turned his back upon the world of real\r\nlife. With his large and wearisome picture of \"Hercules causing Diomedes\r\nto be devoured by his own Horses\" (1835) he sealed his own fate.\r\nConventionality had conquered nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROS.   SAUL.]\r\n\r\nThe painters overwhelmed him with ridicule, and a shrill shout of\r\nderision rose from all the critics. Already, for some time past, a few\r\nwriters had risen to protest against the Classical school. They spoke\r\nwith fiery eloquence of the rights of humanity, the benefits of liberty,\r\nthe independence of thought, the true principles of the Revolution, and\r\nfound numerous readers. They fought against rigid laws in the\r\nintellectual as well as the social sphere; they pointed out that there\r\nwere other worlds besides that of antiquity, and that even the latter\r\nwas not peopled exclusively by cold statues; they delighted in\r\ndescribing the great and beautiful scenes of Nature, and opened out once\r\nmore a new and broad horizon to art and poetry. The Spring was\r\nawakening; Gros felt that he had outlived himself. Arming himself\r\nagainst the voices of the new era with the fatal heroism of the deaf, he\r\nbecame the martyr of Classicism in French art. He was a Classic by\r\neducation, a Romantic by temperament; a man who took his greatest pride\r\nin giving the lie as a teacher to the work he had accomplished as an\r\nartist, and this discordance was his ruin.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of June 1835, being sixty-four years of age, he took up his\r\nhat and stick, left his house without a word to any one, and laid\r\nhimself face-downwards in a tributary of the Seine near Meudon. It was a\r\nshallow place, scarce three feet deep, which a child could easily have\r\nwaded through. It was not till next day, when he had been dead for\r\ntwenty-four hours, that he was discovered by two sailors walking home\r\nalong the bank. One of them struck his foot against a black silk hat. In\r\nit there was a white cravat marked with the initial G., carefully\r\nfolded, and upon it a short note to his wife. On a torn visiting-card\r\ncould still be read the name, Baron Gros. A little farther on they saw\r\nthe corpse, and as they were afraid to touch a drowned man, they drew\r\nlots with straws to decide which of them should pull him out. \"I feel it\r\nwithin me, it is a misfortune for me to be alone. One begins to be\r\ndisgusted with one's self, and then all is over,\" he had once in his\r\nyouth written to his mother with gloomy foreboding. Such was the end of\r\na master every fibre of whose being was in revolt against Classicism,\r\nand who had so great a love for colour, truth, and life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L'Art._\r\n\r\n  ANTOINE JEAN, BARON GROS.]\r\n\r\nMore important events were yet to take place before the signal of\r\ndeliverance could be expected. It was the young men who had grown up\r\namid the desolate associations of the Restoration who were to lead to\r\nvictory the new movement of which Prudhon and Gros had been the\r\nforerunners. The dictatorship over art of that Classical school which\r\nhad been taken over from the seventeenth century was limited to a single\r\ngeneration--from the birththroes of the Revolution to the fall of the\r\nNapoleonic Empire. For although many of David's pupils survived until\r\nthe middle of the century, yet they were merely academic big-wigs, who,\r\ncompared with the young men of genius who were storming their positions,\r\nrepresent that mediocrity which had indeed attained to external honours,\r\nbut had remained stationary, fast bound to antiquated rules. The future\r\nbelonged to the young, to a youth which from the standpoint of our own\r\ndays seems even younger than youth commonly is, richer, fresher, more\r\nglowing and fiery--the Generation of 1830, the \"_vaillants de dix-huit\r\ncent trente_,\" as Théophile Gautier called them in one of his poems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo, Levi._\r\n\r\n  GROS.   THE BATTLE OF EYLAU.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE GENERATION OF 1830\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the years which elapsed between 1820 and 1848 France produced a\r\ngreat and admirable school of art. After the convulsions of the\r\nRevolution and the wars of the Empire, that generation had arisen,\r\ndaring and eager for action, which de Musset describes in his\r\n_Confessions d'un Enfan du Siècle_. And these young men, born between\r\nthe thunders of one battle and another, who had grown up in the midst of\r\ngreatness and glory, had to experience, as they ripened into manhood,\r\nthe ignominy of Charles X's reign, the period of clerical reaction. They\r\nsaw monasteries re-erected, laws of mediæval severity made against\r\nblasphemy and the desecration of churches and saints' days, and the\r\ndoctrine of the divine origin of the monarchy proclaimed anew. \"And when\r\nyoung men spoke of glory,\" says de Musset, \"the answer was, 'Become\r\npriests!' And when they spoke of honour, the answer was, 'Become\r\npriests!' And when they spoke of hope, of love, of strength and life,\r\never the same answer, 'Become priests!'\" The only result of this\r\npressure was to intensify all the more the impulse towards freedom. The\r\npolitical and intellectual reaction could only have the effect of\r\nimpelling the poetic and artistic emotions of young and unquiet spirits\r\ninto opposition, on principle, to all that was established, into a fiery\r\ncontempt for public opinion, into the apotheosis of unrestrained passion\r\nand unfettered genius. The French Romanticists were anti-Philistines who\r\nregarded the word \"bourgeois\" as an insult. For them Art was the one\r\nsupreme consideration; it was to them a light and a flame, and its\r\nbeauty and daring the only things worth living for. For those who put\r\nforward such demands as these, the \"eunuchism of the Classical\"--an\r\nexpression of George Sand's--could never suffice. They dreamed of an art\r\nof painting which should find its expression in blood, purple, light,\r\nmovement, and boldness; they held in sovereign contempt the correct,\r\npedantic, colourless tendency of their elders. An inner flame should\r\nglow through and liberate the forms, absorb the lines and contours, and\r\nmould the picture into a symphony of colour. What was desired and sought\r\nfor, in poetry and in music, in plastic art and in painting, was colour\r\nand passion: colour so energetic, that drawing was, as it were, consumed\r\nby it; passion so vehement, that lyrical poetry and the drama were in\r\ndanger of becoming feverish and convulsive. A movement which reminds one\r\nof the Renaissance took possession of all minds. It was as though there\r\nwere something intoxicating in the very air that one breathed. On a\r\npolitical background of grey upon grey, consisting of the cowls of the\r\nJesuits of the Restoration, there arose a flaming, refulgent, blustering\r\nliterature and art, scintillating with sparks and bright hues, full of\r\nthe adoration of passion and of fervid colour. Romanticism is\r\nProtestantism in literature and art--such is Vitet's definition of the\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nLiterature, which, adapting itself to the politics of the government,\r\nhad begun in Chateaubriand with an enthusiastic fervour for Catholicism,\r\nMonarchy, and Mediævalism, had in the twenties become revolutionary; and\r\nthe description of its battles is one of the most glowing chapters in\r\nGeorge Brandes' classic work. There was a revolt against the\r\npseudo-antique, against the stiff handling of the Alexandrine metre,\r\nagainst the yoke of tradition. Then arose that mighty race of Romantic\r\npoets who proclaimed with Byronic fire the gospel of nature and passion.\r\nDe Musset, the famous child of the century, the idol of the young\r\ngeneration, the poet with the burning heart, who rushed through life\r\nwith such eagerness and haste that at the age of forty he broke down\r\naltogether, worn out like a man of seventy, deliberately wrote bad\r\nrhymes in his first poems, for the purpose of thoroughly infuriating the\r\nClassicists. So, too, he wrote his dramas, in which love is glorified as\r\na serious and terrible power with which one may not trifle, as the fire\r\nwith which one must not play, as the electric spark that kills. So\r\nGeorge Sand, the female Titan of Romanticism, published her novels, with\r\ntheir subversive tendencies and their sparkling animation of narrative.\r\nBetween these two rises the keen bronze-like profile of Prosper Mérimée,\r\nwho prefers to describe the life of gypsies and robbers, and to depict\r\nthe most violent and desperate characters in history. Finally, Victor\r\nHugo, the great chieftain of the Romantic school, the Paganini of\r\nliterature, unrivalled in imposing grandeur, in masterly treatment of\r\nlanguage, and in petty vanity, found submissive multitudes to listen to\r\nhim when he rose in fierce and fiery insurrection against the rigid laws\r\nof the bloodless Classical style, and substituted for the actionless and\r\nill-contrived declamatory tragedies of his time his own romantic dramas,\r\nbreathing passion and full of diversified movement.\r\n\r\nThe conflict was deadly. The young generation hailed with applause the\r\nnew Messiah of letters, and grew intoxicated with the harmony of Hugo's\r\nphrases, which sounded so much fuller and fierier than the measured\r\nspeech of Corneille and Racine. The Théâtre Français, recently benumbed\r\nas with the quiet of the grave, became all at once a tumultuous\r\nbattlefield. There they sat, when Hugo's _Cromwell_ and _Hernani_ were\r\nproduced on the stage, correct, well dressed, gloved, close shaven, with\r\ntheir neat ties and shirt collars, the representatives of the old\r\ngeneration, whose blameless conduct had raised them to office and place.\r\nAnd in contrast to them, in the pit were crowded together the young men,\r\nthe \"Jeune France,\" as Théophile Gautier described them, one with his\r\nwaving hair like a lion's mane, another with his Rubens hat and Spanish\r\nmantle, another in his vest of bright red satin. Their common uniform\r\nwas the red waistcoat introduced by Théophile Gautier--not the red\r\nchosen for their symbol by the men of the Revolution, but the\r\nscarlet-red which represented the hatred felt by these enthusiastic\r\nyoung men for all that was grey and dull, and their preference for all\r\nthat is luminous and magnificently coloured in life. They held that the\r\ncontemplation of a beautiful piece of red cloth was an artistic\r\npleasure. A similar change took place at the same time in ladies'\r\ntoilettes. As the Revolution had in ladies' costumes rejected all colour\r\nin favour of the Grecian white, so now dresses once more assumed vivid,\r\nand especially deep red hues; deep red ribbons adorned the hat and\r\nencircled the waist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THÉODORE GÉRICAULT.]\r\n\r\nDeep red--that was the colour of the Romantic school; the flourishing of\r\ntrumpets and the blare of brass its note. Flashes of passion and\r\nferocity, rivers of sulphur, showers of fire, glowing deserts, decaying\r\ncorpses in horrible phosphorescence, seas at night-time in which ships\r\nare sinking, landscapes over which roaring War shakes his brand, and\r\nwhere maddened nations fall furiously upon one another--such are the\r\nsubjects, resonant with shout of battle and song of victory, which held\r\nsway over French Romanticism. At the very time when at Düsseldorf the\r\nyoung artists of Germany were painting with the milk of pious feeling\r\ntheir lachrymose, susceptible, sentimental pictures, utterly tame and\r\nrespectable; when the Nazarene school were holding their post-mortem on\r\nthe livid corpse of old Italian art, and seeking to galvanise it, and\r\nwith it the Christian piety of the Middle Ages, into life again; at that\r\nvery time there arose in France a young generation boiling over with\r\nfervour, who had for their rallying cry Nature and Truth, but demanded\r\nat the same time, and before all else, contrast, pictorial antithesis,\r\nand passion at once lofty and of tiger-like ferocity. In those very\r\nyears, when in Germany, the cartoon style of Carstens having died away,\r\nprogress was limited to a timid and unsuccessful pursuit of that revelry\r\nof colour which marked the Quattrocentisti, the French took at once, as\r\nwith the seven-leagued boots of the fairy-tale, the great stride onward\r\ntowards the Flemings.\r\n\r\nThrough Napoleon, France had grown richer, not only in glory, but in art\r\ntreasures, gathered together from all countries into Paris, as trophies\r\nof the victorious general. The abundant collections thus accumulated\r\nbrought to bear upon that generation the quickening influence of the\r\nbest that had been done in the art of painting. Nowhere could one study\r\neither the Venetian colourists or Rubens to greater advantage than in\r\nthe Louvre, and it was by virtue of this unrestrained intercourse with\r\nthe masters who represent the most perfect blossom of colouring that the\r\nByronic spirits of 1830 succeeded in giving full expression to the\r\nglowing full-coloured life of things which hovered before their heated\r\nimagination. It is unnecessary to say that this was accompanied by a\r\ngreat widening of the range of subjects treated. The Romantic school\r\nshowed that there were other heroes in history and poetry besides the\r\nGreeks and Romans. They painted everything, if only it possessed colour\r\nand character, flame, passion, and exotic perfume. Romanticism was the\r\nprotest of painting against the plastic in art, the protest of liberty\r\nagainst the academic teaching of the Classical school, the revolution of\r\nmovement against stiffness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GÉRICAULT.   THE WOUNDED CUIRASSIER.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the studio of Guérin, the tame and timid Classicist, that the\r\nyoung assailants grew up, \"the daubers of 1830,\" who called the Apollo\r\nBelvidere a shabby yellow turnip, and who spoke of Racine and Raphael as\r\nof street arabs. They were tired of copying profiles of Antinous. The\r\ncontemplation of a picture by Girodet was wearisome to them. It was\r\n_Théodore Géricault_, a hot, hasty passionate nature, of Beethoven-like\r\nunruliness and of heaven-storming boldness, who spoke the word of\r\ndeliverance.\r\n\r\nHe was a Norman, sturdily built and serious in manner. Even while he was\r\nstudying in Guérin's studio he had already grasped some of the ideas\r\nwhich Gros had in his mind, and, although not his pupil, Géricault may\r\nbe said to have continued his work, or at least would have been able to\r\ndo so had he lived longer. Like him, he had from his youth up\r\ncontemplated, full of wonder, the rolling sea and the thunder-laden\r\nskies; like him, he had a predilection for fine horses; and, being of a\r\nsomewhat melancholy disposition, he preferred to treat of the darker\r\naspects of life. His aspiration was to paint the surging sea, proud\r\nsteeds rushing past at a gallop, suffering and striving humanity, great\r\ndeeds, pathos and frenzy in every form. His first works were splendid\r\nhorsemen, whose every muscle twitches with nervous movement. During his\r\nshort stay in Charles Vernet's studio he had already taken an interest\r\nin cavalry, and begun the studies of such subjects, which he continued\r\nto the day of his death. Afterwards, while he was working under Guérin\r\nand before his visit to Italy in 1817, he often went to the Louvre,\r\ncopied pictures and studied Rubens, to the great annoyance of his\r\nteacher, who with horror beheld him entering upon so perilous a path.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GÉRICAULT.   CHASSEUR.]\r\n\r\nHere again he followed in the steps of Gros, whose portrait of General\r\nFournier Sarlovése was hung in the Salon of 1812 close by Géricault's\r\n\"Mounted Officer.\" This picture, a portrait of M. Dieudonné, an officer\r\nin the Chasseurs d'Afrique, crossing the battlefield sword in hand on a\r\nrearing horse, was the first work exhibited by Géricault, then\r\ntwenty-one years of age. It was an event. Gros found himself supported,\r\nif not surpassed, by a beginner who had his own enthusiasm for colour\r\nand movement, for profiles broadly and boldly delineated. In 1814\r\nfollowed the \"Wounded Cuirassier,\" staggering across the field of battle\r\nand dragging his horse behind him. These were no longer warriors seated\r\non classical steeds foaming with rage, but real soldiers in whom there\r\nwas nothing of the Greek statue. Then Géricault went to Italy, but in\r\nthis case also it was not to pursue archæological studies in the\r\nmuseums, but to see the race of the _barberi_ during carnival. To this\r\ntime belong those studies of horses, for the possession of which\r\ncollectors vie with one another to-day, sketches made in the open air,\r\nout in the street or in the stables. \"The Horses at the Manger\" and\r\n\"Horses fighting\" were among the pearls of the collection of French\r\ndrawings in the Paris Exhibition of 1889.\r\n\r\nIn 1819 he completed his greatest picture, that which most people alone\r\ncall to mind--not quite fairly--when his name is mentioned--\"The Raft of\r\nthe Medusa.\" What a tragedy is there represented! For twelve days the\r\nunfortunate wretches have been on the deep, starving, in utter despair\r\nand ready to lift their hands against each other. They were a hundred\r\nand fifty, now they are but fifteen. One old man holds upon his knees\r\nthe corpse of his son; another tears his hair out, left alone in life\r\nafter seeing all his dear ones perish. In the foreground lie dead bodies\r\nwhich the waves have not yet swept away. But far away in the distance a\r\nsail appears. One points it out to another: yes, it is a sail! A mariner\r\nand a negro mount upon an empty barrel and wave their handkerchiefs in\r\nthe air. Will they be seen? The anxiety is terrible. And ever higher and\r\nhigher the grey waves roll on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  GÉRICAULT.   THE RAFT OF THE MEDUSA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GÉRICAULT.   THE START.]\r\n\r\nHow must such a scene have impressed a generation which for long years\r\nhad seen nothing in the Salon but dry mythology and painted statues!\r\nGéricault was the first to free himself from the tyranny of the\r\nplaster-of-Paris bust, and once again to put passion and truth to nature\r\nin the place of cold marble. Just as he commissioned the ship's\r\ncarpenter who had constructed the raft and was one of the saved to make\r\nhim a model of it, so also he moved into a studio close to the hospital,\r\nfor the purpose of studying the sick and dying, of sketching dead bodies\r\nand single limbs. It must be admitted that one would wish for a yet\r\nfirmer grasp of the subject. In form, Géricault still belongs to the\r\nschool of David. A good deal of Classicism shows itself in the fact that\r\nhe thought it necessary to depict the majority of the figures naked, in\r\norder to avoid \"unpictorial\" costumes. There is still something academic\r\nin the figures, which do not seem to be sufficiently weakened by\r\nprivation, disease, and the struggle with death; but what man can free\r\nhimself at one stroke from the influence of his time and environment?\r\nEven in the colouring there lingers some touch of the Classical school.\r\nIt offends no one, a fact to be insisted on in comparing him with the\r\nNazarenes; but as yet it plays no part in expressing the meaning of the\r\npicture. From the distance, indeed, whence the rescuing ship is drawing\r\nnear, a bright light shines forth upon a scene otherwise depicted in\r\ndull brown. Save for this, the intention of the picture is not expressed\r\nby means of colour, and it even shows some retrogression as compared\r\nwith Géricault's earlier works. He had begun with Rubens, yet these\r\nstudies in colouring did not last. In the \"Wounded Cuirassier\" of 1814\r\ndark tones took the place of the former cheerfulness, and so in the\r\n\"Raft of the Medusa\" he imagined the tragedy could be represented only\r\nin sombre hues. He spread over the whole scene a monotonous unpleasant\r\nbrown shade, and in his endeavour to lay all weight upon human emotion\r\nhe went so far as almost to suppress the sea, which nevertheless played\r\nthe chief part in the drama, and whose deep blue would have afforded a\r\nsplendid contrast. Discoveries are not to be made all at once, but only\r\nwhen their hour is come.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  EUGÈNE DELACROIX.]\r\n\r\nThe next step in French art was to be that of reinstating the\r\nsignificance of colour in the full rights conquered for it by Titian, so\r\nthat it should no longer be merely a tasteful tinting of the figures,\r\nbut should become truly that which gives its temper to the picture. It\r\nwas not reserved for Géricault to effect this. A trip to London, which\r\nhe made in 1820, in company with his friend Charlet, was the last event\r\nof his life. There the sportsman awoke in him once more, and he painted\r\nthe \"Race for the Derby at Epsom.\" Soon after his return he was thrown\r\nfrom his horse while riding, but lingered on for two years longer,\r\nsuffering from a spinal complaint. With a few more years in which to\r\ndevelop he should have been one of the great masters of France, but he\r\ndied when scarcely in his thirty-second year.\r\n\r\nYet he lived long enough to observe, in the Salon of 1822, the début of\r\none of his comrades from Guérin's studio. A greater than himself, to\r\nwhom with dying voice he had given a few words of advice, arose as the\r\nintellectual heir of the young painter so prematurely carried off, and\r\ncarried to its issue the struggle which he had begun. It was on 26th\r\nApril 1799, at midday, that the first genuine painter's eye of the\r\ncentury saw the light, at Charenton Saint-Maurice. Géricault had made a\r\nbeginning, but it was the impetuous, powerful genius of _Eugène\r\nDelacroix_ which entered in and completed his work. What Gros had dimly\r\nperceived, but had not dared to express, what Géricault had barely had\r\ntime with a courageous hand to point out, a hand too soon stiffened in\r\ndeath--the modern poetry of colour, of fever, and of quivering\r\nemotion--it was reserved for Delacroix to write.\r\n\r\n\"That child will grow up to be a famous man; his life will be extremely\r\nlaborious, but also extremely agitated, and always exposed to\r\nopposition.\" Thus had a madman prophesied of the boy one day when he and\r\nhis nurse were taking a walk near the lunatic asylum at Charenton. And\r\nhe was right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L'Art._\r\n\r\n  DELACROIX.   DANTE'S BARK.]\r\n\r\nDelacroix was another of the pupils who had grown up in Guérin's studio,\r\nbut he became the latter's antipode. Even in his student years he took\r\ncounsel, not of the antique, but of Rubens and Veronese; and when\r\nGéricault was painting his \"Raft of the Medusa,\" Delacroix belonged to\r\nthe little band of enthusiastic admirers which gathered round the young\r\nmaster. He served as model for the half-submerged man to the left in the\r\nforeground of that picture. After busying himself at first almost\r\nentirely with caricatures, and studies of horses, and with Madonnas in\r\nthe Classical style, he exhibited in 1822 his \"Dante's Bark,\" in a\r\npictorial sense the first characteristic picture of the century. One is\r\ninclined even to-day to repeat David's exclamation when he caught sight\r\nof the work, the first great epoch-making life-utterance of the\r\nrevolutionary Romanticists: \"_D'où vient-il? Je ne connais pas cette\r\ntouche-la._\" There were thoughts in it which had not been conceived and\r\nexpressed in the same manner since the time of Tintoretto. Dante and\r\nVirgil, ferried by Phlegyas over Acheron, are passing among the souls of\r\nthe damned, who grasp hold of the boat with the energy of despair. A\r\ntheme taken from a mediæval author; an antique figure, that of Virgil,\r\nbut seen through the prism of modern poetry. While the Florentine, stiff\r\nwith horror, gazes upon the swimming figures which cling to the boat\r\nwith teeth and nails, Virgil, tranquil and serious, turns on them a face\r\nwhich the emotions of life can no longer affect.\r\n\r\nThe work obtained a decisive success. A carpenter in Delacroix's house\r\nhad made for the young painter an inartistic frame of four boards. When\r\nhe went to the exhibition and looked for his picture in the side-rooms\r\nhe could not find it. The frame had fallen to pieces during removal, but\r\nthe picture had been hung in an honourable place in the Louvre, in a\r\nrich frame ordered for it by Baron Gros. \"You must learn drawing, my\r\nyoung friend, and then you will become a second Rubens,\" was the salute\r\nwhich this remarkable man, whose theory ever gave the lie to his\r\npractice, gave the young master. Naturally Delacroix would not now have\r\nbeen admitted into the school of David, or would have been placed there\r\nin the lowest rank--with Rubens and a few other immortals, who drew no\r\nbetter than he did. He was absolutely opposed to all the exact, regular,\r\nwell-balanced, colourless traditions which held sway in David's school\r\nwith their pedantic erudition and _bourgeois_ discretion. The principle\r\nof the Classicists was the Greek type of beauty, and the translation of\r\nsculpture into painting. In Delacroix's picture there was no longer\r\nanything of that sort. Géricault had already broken away from the\r\nacademic stencilling of form, and had substituted natural expression,\r\nlife, and emotion for conventional types; Delacroix now set aside the\r\nsullen colouring of the Classical school, and its painted statues made\r\nway for the colour-symphonies of the Venetians.\r\n\r\nThese reforming qualities found in his second work, a few years later, a\r\nmuch fuller expression than in the \"Dante's Bark.\" At that time the\r\nGreeks, that heroic nation, struggling and dying for its religion and\r\nindependence, had excited everywhere the deepest sympathy and\r\nenthusiasm. Delacroix was the very man to be inspired by such a theme.\r\nFrom the agitation caused by the martyrdom of Greece, and from his\r\ntaste for Byron's poetry, resulted in 1824 the celebrated \"Massacre of\r\nChios,\" on which he was already employed in 1821, before the completion\r\nof his \"Dante's Bark,\" and in which his power of expression as well as\r\nof colour was carried much further than in the earlier picture. In the\r\n\"Dante's Bark\" there were still, both in form and colour, reminiscences\r\nof the great Florentine masters; as, for instance, in the female figure\r\nin the foreground, which is almost an exact reproduction of Michael\r\nAngelo's \"Night.\" The event depicted was comparatively quiet and\r\ntranquil, and the well-balanced composition would have done honour to\r\nthe most rigorous follower of David. The only novelty lay in the\r\ntreatment of colour, and in the substitution of the individual and\r\ncharacteristic for the typical and ideal. But undoubtedly it was now\r\npossible not only to produce in colour more powerful chords, but also in\r\nexpression to strike notes more dramatic, for the academic\r\nplaster-of-Paris heads of the David school had depicted human emotion\r\nonly in icy immobility. Delacroix had put all these possibilities into\r\nthe new picture. The pyramidal configuration has resolved itself into an\r\nunconstrained grouping of figures. Here we have for the first time the\r\nartistic spirit intoxicated with colour, the \"Orlando Furioso of\r\ncolourists,\" the pupil of Rubens, Delacroix. An entire world of deep\r\nfeeling and of painfully passionate poetry, an entire world of tones,\r\nwhich the master under whose eyes he painted his \"Dante\" could not have\r\nconceived, lies enclosed within the frame of this picture. The figures,\r\nsitting, kneeling, partly reclining, with their half-starved bodies and\r\ntheir gloomy, brooding, hopeless faces; the desperate struggle between\r\nthe conquerors and their victims in the far distance; the contrast\r\nbetween this scene of horror and the luminous splendour of the\r\natmosphere, and the wealth of colour in the whole, made and still make\r\nthis fine painting one of the most impressive pictures in the Louvre. It\r\nis a work which flames in glow of colour more than any that had appeared\r\nin France since the days of Rubens. The English had been his teachers.\r\n\"It is here only that colour and effect are understood and felt,\"\r\nGéricault had previously written from London. Delacroix's work had\r\nalready been sent off to the Salon when Constable's first pictures were\r\njust arriving there, and the impression which they made upon him was so\r\npowerful that, at the very last moment, and in the Louvre itself, he\r\ngave his picture a brighter and more luminous colouring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  DELACROIX.   HAMLET AND THE GRAVE-DIGGERS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L'Art._\r\n\r\n  DELACROIX.   TASSO IN THE MAD-HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nAnd indeed it was not till now that the Classicists perceived how great\r\nan opponent had arisen against them. Not only did the aged Gros call the\r\n\"Massacre of Chios\" \"_le massacre de la peinture_,\" but all the critics\r\ntalked about barbarism, and prophesied that on this path French painting\r\nwould hasten to its destruction. The prize of the Salon was awarded, not\r\nto the \"Massacre,\" but to Sigalon's \"Locusta,\" an unimportant work of\r\ncompromise, though very clever and well studied in draughtsmanship. It\r\nwas said that Delacroix's picture was lacking in symmetrical\r\narrangement, that he showed too great a contempt for the beautiful, that\r\nindeed he appeared systematically to prefer the ugly--that is to say, he\r\nwas blamed for the very qualities wherein lay his importance as a\r\nreformer. Accustomed as they had been for many years to an art in which\r\nintellect, correctness, and moderation held sway, not one of the critics\r\nwas in a position to perceive all at once the value of this fiery\r\nspirit. Delécluze, the indefatigable defender of the sacred dogmas of\r\nthe Classical school, characterised \"dramatic expression and composition\r\nmarked by action\" as the reef whereon the grand style of painting must\r\ninevitably be wrecked. The modern schools of art, he taught as late as\r\n1824, exist, flourish, and have their being only by the utilisation of\r\nwhat we can learn from the Greeks. Even acknowledging the progress in\r\ncolour which the work showed, it nevertheless belonged, he said, to an\r\ninferior genus, and all its excellences in colouring could not outweigh\r\nthe ugliness of its form.\r\n\r\nTherewith began the battles of the Romantic school, and all the daring\r\nof Théophile Gautier, Thiers, Victor Hugo, Sainte-Beuve, Baudelaire,\r\nBürger-Thoré, Gustave Planche, Paul Mantz, and others had to be called\r\nupon in order to storm the heights held by the batteries of the\r\nClassical critics. Count Forbin gave proof of no less courage when he\r\nbought the picture, torn to shreds as it was by hostile criticism, for\r\nthe State, at the price of six thousand francs. This enabled Delacroix\r\nto visit England. He spent the time from spring to autumn of 1825 in\r\nLondon, where he consorted amicably with all the artists of the day. And\r\nhe took an interest not only in English art, but also in literature and\r\nthe drama. His preference for Shakespeare, Byron, and Walter Scott, who\r\nwere already his favourite poets, found new sustenance. An English opera\r\nmade him acquainted with Goethe's _Faust_; and henceforth these poets\r\nentered into the foreground of his works. A picture of \"Tasso\" (the poet\r\nin a cell of the madhouse, through the window of which two grinning\r\nlunatics look in upon him) in 1826, the \"Execution of the Doge Marino\r\nFaliero\" and the \"Death of Sardanapalus,\" both after Byron, in 1827, and\r\n\"Faust in his Study\" in 1828, followed the \"Massacre\"--all of them\r\nobviously the works of a painter who loved bright, glowing colour, had\r\nstudied Rubens and had recently returned from England. In 1828 was\r\npublished, in seventeen plates, his cycle of illustrations to _Faust_,\r\nto accompany a translation of the poem into French; and this was\r\nfollowed by a number of lithographs on Shakespearian subjects.\r\n\r\nAnd here we may notice a singular exchange of parts. When the word\r\n\"Romantic\" was first heard in Germany it had originally much the same\r\nsense as \"Roman.\" The German Romanticists were moved to enthusiasm by\r\nRoman Catholicism and Roman church painting. But when Romanticism\r\nreached France, the word came to mean exactly the opposite: a preference\r\nfor the German and English spirit as compared with the Greek and Latin,\r\nand an enthusiasm for the great Anglo-Saxon and German poets,\r\nShakespeare and Goethe, in whom, contrasting with Racine's correctness,\r\nwere to be found unrestrained genius and glowing passion. This influence\r\nof poetry over art may easily become dangerous, if painters sponge, so\r\nto speak, upon the poet, as the Düsseldorf school did, and make use of\r\nhis work only for the purpose of enabling works, in themselves\r\nvalueless, to keep their heads, artistically speaking, above water, by\r\nmeans of their extrinsic poetical interest. But Delacroix had no need of\r\nany such support. He was not the poets' pupil, but their brother. He did\r\nnot study them in order to illustrate their works, but was imbued with\r\ntheir spirit and possessed by their souls. He lived with them; he did\r\nnot borrow his subjects from them, but rather made use of them to\r\nexpress in his own powerful language the strongest emotions of the human\r\nheart. Nor did he ever forget that painting must, before all, be\r\npainting. Endowed as he was with a poet's soul, he conceived things as a\r\npainter, not laboriously translating passages from the poets, but simply\r\nthinking in colour. What the musician hears, what the poet imagines, he\r\nsaw. The scenes of which he read appeared at once before his eyes as\r\nsketches, in great masses of colour. For him, composition, action, and\r\ncolour ever united together into one inseparable whole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DELACROIX.   ENTRY OF THE CRUSADERS INTO CONSTANTINOPLE.]\r\n\r\nThe journey to Morocco, which he made in the spring of 1832, in company\r\nwith an embassy sent by Louis Philippe to the Emperor Muley Abderrahman,\r\nis noteworthy for a further progress in his ability as a colourist and a\r\nnew broadening of his range of subjects. When he returned to the port\r\nof Toulon, on 5th July 1832, he had seen Algiers and Spain, and had\r\nassimilated an abundance of sunshine and colour. It is in his Oriental\r\npictures that his painting first reaches its zenith, just as Victor\r\nHugo's mastery over language was at its highest point in his\r\n_Orientales_. Goethe, in his _West-östliches Divan_, celebrated what is\r\nquiet and contemplative in the Oriental view of life. Obermann sang of\r\nthe land of legend, of buried treasures, of Aladdin and the wonderful\r\nlamp; but for Byron (who was practically the first to introduce into\r\nEurope the perfume and colour of the East), for Hugo, and for Delacroix,\r\nit was the distant, bright-hued, barbaric land of the rising sun, the\r\nland of sanguinary warfare and overthrow, the home of light and colour.\r\nHere it was that the French Romanticists found the world that realised\r\ntheir dreams of colour. The East became for them what Rome had been for\r\nthe Classical school. From the feeble and misty sun of Paris, and from\r\nthe grey skies of the Boulevard des Italiens, they turned to Africa.\r\n\r\nHis enthusiasm for this newly discovered world resounds, full and clear,\r\nin Delacroix's letters. \"Were I to leave the land in which I have found\r\nthem,\" he wrote, during his stay in Morocco, of the men whom he saw\r\nabout him there, \"they would seem to me like trees torn up by the roots.\r\nI should forget the impressions I have received, and should be able only\r\nin an incomplete and frigid manner to reproduce the sublime and\r\nfascinating life which fills the streets here, and attracts one by the\r\nbeauty of its appearance. Think, my friend, what it means to a painter\r\nto see lying in the sunshine, wandering about the streets and offering\r\nshoes for sale, men who have the appearance of ancient consuls, of the\r\nreincarnated spirits of Cato and Brutus, who lack not even that proud,\r\ndiscontented look which those lords of the world must have had. They\r\npossess nothing save a blanket in which they walk, sleep, and are\r\nburied, and yet they look as dignified as Cicero in his curule chair.\r\nWhat truth, what nobility in these figures! There is nothing more\r\nbeautiful in the antique. And all in white, as with Roman senators or at\r\nthe Greek Panathenæa.\"\r\n\r\nHis palette was thus further enriched in lucid tints, the contrasts he\r\nformerly delighted in became less sharp and glaring, the gloomy\r\nbackground hitherto preferred was superseded by a bright serenity and a\r\ngolden lustre. The colour-effect of his \"Algerian Women\" has been not\r\nunaptly compared to the impression produced by a glance into an open\r\njewel casket. In his \"Convulsionaries of Tangier\" he has depicted with\r\nwild, demoniac energy the religious frenzy of a Turkish sect. Green,\r\nblue, red, and violet hues unite to produce an effect as of a sounding\r\nflourish of trumpets, recalling the music of the janizaries. The \"Entry\r\nof the Crusaders into Constantinople\" resembles an old delicately tinted\r\ncarpet, full of powerful, tranquil harmony. Even in his old age he\r\nwrote: \"The aspect of that country will be for ever before my eyes; the\r\ntypes of that vigorous race will move in my memory as long as I live; in\r\nthem I truly found the antique beauty again.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  DELACROIX.   JESUS ON LAKE GENNESARET.]\r\n\r\nThe contemplation of such scenes induced Delacroix to undertake the\r\nrepresentation of antique subjects, which he had hitherto avoided, not\r\nbecause he disliked the antique, but because of the aversion he felt for\r\nDavid's treatment of it. During his sojourn in Africa he had come to the\r\nconclusion that the painting of scenes from ancient history should not\r\nbe based upon the imitation of statues and bas-reliefs, as with David\r\nand his pupils; but that it should be imbued with the movement and\r\npassion of modern life, since the ancient Greeks were men of flesh and\r\nblood like ourselves. Therefore it is that he snatches the marble mask\r\nfrom the faces of David's puppets. Flemish blood begins to move in the\r\nGreek statues, Flemish passion to break through their inflexible rhythm.\r\nPaintings such as the \"Justice of Trajan\" of 1840 represent the antique\r\nin a thoroughly personal and modern paraphrase, just as Shakespeare or\r\nByron had seen it. The mad \"Medea\" is, from the point of view of colour,\r\ncertainly the chief work of this group.\r\n\r\nIt was of course impossible that a man so highly endowed with emotional\r\npathos should pass untouched the tragedy of the life of Christ and the\r\nsufferings of the Christian martyrs. By the Revolution religious themes\r\nhad been absolutely excluded from representation, and up to this time\r\nthe young innovators of the Restoration period had also felt an\r\naversion for them. Their ideas were as little attuned to Catholic as to\r\nacademic tradition. Delacroix was the first to treat once more of\r\nbiblical subjects, so far as they are imbued with dramatic and\r\npassionate movement. Like Rubens, he regarded the lives of the saints,\r\nthe story of the Gospels, and the tragedy on Golgotha as a poetical\r\nnarrative like any other. His Mary, like that of the Flemish painters,\r\nis a sorrowing woman, the embodiment of unending grief.\r\n\r\nAlongside of these easel pictures he produced, during a period of more\r\nthan twenty-five years, a long list of monumental and decorative works;\r\nand they too were the most inventive, the boldest, and the most original\r\nwhich monumental painting produced during this epoch, not in France\r\nonly, but in Europe. In this sphere also, where, under the pressure of\r\nold traditions and conventional types, it is so difficult to avoid\r\nplagiarism, Delacroix maintained his individuality. In 1835, at the\r\nsuggestion of his friend Thiers, he was commissioned to paint the\r\ninterior of the Chamber of Deputies in the Palais Bourbon--the most\r\nimportant commission which had fallen to the lot of any French artist\r\nsince Gros painted the cupola of the Pantheon. Not long afterwards he\r\ndecorated with verve and enthusiasm the ceiling of the Louvre, choosing\r\nfor his subject the \"Triumph of Apollo.\" In the Library of the\r\nLuxembourg he had recourse to the _Divina Commedia_, and treated in a\r\nmasterly manner the theme so familiar and sympathetic to him. In his\r\nworks there is something of the joyous and sportive energy of Rubens'\r\nallegorical pictures, but not the least trace of imitation. He\r\nunderstood decorative painting in the sense of the great old masters,\r\nGiulio Romano and Veronese, not as wall didactics and lectures on\r\narchæology; he knew that descriptive prose has nothing whatever to do\r\nwith the walls of a building, but that the sole aim of such paintings is\r\nto fill the house with their solemn grandeur, to make the whole building\r\nresound as it were with sacred organ music. Between 1853 and 1861 came\r\nalso the wall paintings in the Church of Saint Sulpice, and one would\r\nalmost think that Delacroix finished them in feverish excitement, to\r\nshow for the last time how enormous a store of passion and power still\r\nlay in the soul of a sexagenarian. Shortly after their completion, on\r\n13th August 1863, he died, who was, in the words of Silvestre, \"the\r\npainter of the genuine race, who had the sun in his head and a\r\nthunderstorm in his heart, who in the course of forty years sounded the\r\nentire gamut of human emotion, and whose grandiose and awe-inspiring\r\nbrush passed from saints to warriors, from warriors to lovers, from\r\nlovers to tigers, from tigers to flowers.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  DELACROIX.   HORSES FIGHTING IN A STABLE.]\r\n\r\nIn these words Delacroix is very aptly characterised. His range of\r\nsubjects included everything: decorative, historical, and religious\r\npainting, landscape, flowers, animals, sea pieces, classical antiquity\r\nand the Middle Ages, the scorching heat of the south and the mists of\r\nthe north. He left no branch of the art of painting untouched; nothing\r\nescaped his lion's claws. But there is one bond uniting all: to all the\r\nfigures for which he won the citizenship of art he gave passion and\r\nmovement. His predominant quality is a passion for the terrible, a kind\r\nof insatiability for wild and violent action. His over-excited\r\nimagination heaps pain, horror, and pathos one upon another. The critics\r\ncalled him \"the tattooed savage who paints with a drunken broom.\" There\r\nis nothing pretty or lovable about his art; it is a wild art. He\r\ndepicted passion wherever he found it, in the shape of wild animals,\r\nstormy seas, or battling warriors; and he sought it in every sphere, in\r\nnature no less than in poetry and the Bible. Hardly any painter--not\r\neven Rubens--has depicted with equal power the passions and movements of\r\nanimals: lions in which he is own brother to Barye; fighting horses, in\r\nwhich he stands side by side with Géricault. No other artist painted\r\nwaves more grand, wind-beaten, foaming, dashing, towering on high.\r\nLooking at them, one divines all the horrors concealed beneath the roar\r\nof the blue surface, horrors which were as yet so insufficiently\r\nsuggested in Géricault's \"Raft of the Medusa.\" In his historical\r\npictures there reigns now terror and despair, as in the \"Massacre of\r\nChios\"; now gloomy horror, as in the \"Medea\"; now feverish movement, as\r\nin the \"Death of the Bishop of Liège.\" He passes from Dante to\r\nShakespeare, from Goethe to Byron, but only to borrow from them their\r\nmost moving dramatic situations--Hamlet at Yorick's grave, his fight\r\nwith Laertes, Macbeth and the Witches, Lady Macbeth, Gretchen,\r\nAngelica, the Prisoner of Chillon, the Giaour, and the Pasha. All time\r\nis his domain, all countries are open to him; he hurries through the\r\nbroad fields of imagination, a lordly reaper of all harvests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  DELACROIX.   MEDEA.]\r\n\r\nAnd at the same time, in all his great human tragedies, he compels the\r\nelements to obey him as if they were his slaves. The passions of men set\r\nheaven and earth in motion. The agonising cries of victims find in his\r\npaintings an echo in the sullen shadows and the leaden, heavy clouds of\r\nthe sky. The gloomy shores which Dante's boat is approaching are as\r\ndesolate as the spirits who wander through the night. But where\r\nsplendour and glory reign, as in the \"Entry of the Crusaders into\r\nConstantinople,\" the air, too, glistens and shines as though saturated\r\nwith dust of gold. In his pictures a human soul which was great and full\r\nof meaning, and which possessed such combustibility that it took fire of\r\nitself, expressed itself recklessly, with the volcanic strength of an\r\nelemental power.\r\n\r\nThis proud self-reliance explains also how it was that this painter of\r\nunruly genius was, as a man, very far from being a revolutionist. For\r\nDelacroix the outer world had no existence; that world alone existed\r\nwhich was within him. After his picture of \"The Barricades\" in 1831 he\r\navoided all political allusions, painted, read, and led a tranquil,\r\nmeasured, uniform life. In society polite and reserved, of aristocratic\r\ncoldness, gentlemanly in appearance, and well-bred; in his speech curt,\r\nmordant, emphatic, and occasionally witty, he could nevertheless show\r\nhimself, when he chose, an amiable, original talker, full of piquant\r\nideas. Moreover, he was a great writer and critic, whose essays in the\r\n_Revue des Deux Mondes_ have the perfect classic stamp. Nevertheless, he\r\nwas always displeased when any one put him forward as the chief of\r\nofficial Romanticism, and saluted him as the Victor Hugo of painting.\r\nSurrounded as he was by young assailants of tradition who would allow no\r\nmerit to anything old, he found pleasure in acknowledging his admiration\r\nfor Racine, whom he knew by heart, and whom, when need was, he defended\r\nagainst the younger generation. He was too diplomatic to stir up against\r\nhimself unnecessarily the hatred of those whom the long-haired Samsons\r\nof Romanticism called Philistines.\r\n\r\nSo far as in him lay, his quiet and methodical life should suffer no\r\ninterruption. Worshipper though he was of light and colour, he was\r\nalmost always shut up in his gloomy studio, and it was only when he\r\nfound himself brush in hand that the reserved man became the passionate,\r\nvibrating painter. Then the memories with which his study of the poets\r\nhad stored his mind grew in his fantasy into grand pictures glowing with\r\nlife. By these visions he was excited, set on fire, and filled with\r\nenthusiasm. His studio was open but to few, for the intrusion of\r\nvisitors chilled his inspiration, and he found it difficult to recover\r\nthe proper frame of mind. Not till evening did he take his first meal,\r\nfor he thought he could work with greater intensity when hungry. During\r\na period of forty years he lived in his various studios, quiet and\r\nsolitary, inventing, drawing, and painting without intermission, his\r\ndoor always bolted, so that when it suited him he could give out that he\r\nwas ill of a fever. Every morning before work he drew an arm, a hand, or\r\na piece of drapery after Rubens. He had formed the habit of taking\r\nRubens to himself when other people were drinking their coffee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L'Art._\r\n\r\n  DELACROIX.   THE EXPULSION OF HELIODORUS.]\r\n\r\nIndeed, when one speaks of Delacroix, the name of Rubens rises almost\r\ninvoluntarily to one's lips; and yet there is a profound difference\r\nbetween him and the great Flemish master. Rubens has the same passion,\r\nthe same ever-active fancy; yet all his pictures rest in triumphant\r\nrepose, while every one of Delacroix's seems to resound as with a cry of\r\nbattle. Looking at Rubens' works you feel that he was a happy, healthy\r\nman; but by the time you have seen half a score of Delacroix's it is\r\nborne in upon you that the life of the artist was one of strife and\r\nsuffering. Rubens was the very essence of strength, Delacroix was a sick\r\nman; the former full of fleshly joyous sensuality, the latter consumed\r\nby a feverish internal fire.\r\n\r\nHis portrait of himself in the Louvre, with its pale forehead, its large\r\ndark-rimmed eyes, its lean, hollow face, its parchment-like skin\r\nstretched tightly over the bones, explains his pictures better than any\r\ncritical appreciation. Delacroix was one of the _âmes maladives_, the\r\nspirits sick unto death, to whom Baudelaire addresses himself in his\r\n_Fleurs du Mal_. Delicate from his youth up, thoroughly nervous by\r\nnature, he prolonged his sickly existence throughout his life by sheer\r\nenergy of will. Even in his childhood he passed through serious\r\nillnesses, and later on he suffered in turn from his stomach, throat,\r\nchest, and kidneys. Like Goethe in his old age, he felt well only when\r\nthe temperature was high. He was short in stature. A leonine head, with\r\na lion's mane, surmounted a body that seemed almost stunted. With his\r\neyes flashing like carbuncles, and his disordered prickly moustache, his\r\nwas the fascinating ugliness of genius.\r\n\r\nIt was only by the strictest dieting in his quiet retreat at Champrosay\r\nthat he prolonged his life for the last few years. In his youth he\r\nhovered like a butterfly from flower to flower; when grown old and\r\nhypochondriacal he withdrew into solitary retirement, work was the only\r\nmedicine for diseased conditions of all kinds, to which he found himself\r\ndaily more and more a victim. Only thus could this sickly man, doomed\r\nfrom his very birth, come to produce no less than two thousand\r\npictures--a number all the more astonishing as Delacroix, even when his\r\nhealth permitted him to work at his easel, by no means possessed Rubens'\r\nsovereign facility of production. The fever of work alternated, in his\r\ncase, with the extremest exhaustion. There was something morbid,\r\nnervous, over-excited in all he did. \"Even work,\" he writes, \"is merely\r\na temporary narcotic, a distraction; and every distraction, as Pascal\r\nhas said in other words, is only a method which man has invented to\r\nconceal from himself the abyss of his suffering and misery. In sleepless\r\nnights, in illness, and in certain moments of solitude, when the end of\r\nall things discloses itself in its utter nakedness, a man endowed with\r\nimagination must possess a certain amount of courage, not to meet the\r\nphantom half-way, not to rush to embrace the skeleton.\"\r\n\r\nThe feverish disposition which he brought with him into the world was\r\nheightened by the acrimonious feuds in which, as a painter, he was\r\nforced to engage, and which left great bitterness behind them in his\r\nmind. His life and his art were in accord, in as much as both were\r\nbattles. It is not easy to live when one is always ill; not easy to meet\r\nwith recognition when one proclaims the exact opposite of that which for\r\na generation past all the world has held to be true. And Delacroix took\r\nnot a single step to meet his opponents half-way. He did not trouble\r\nhimself for a single moment to please the public; and therefore the\r\npublic did not come to him. Controversies such as that which took place\r\nover the \"Massacre of Chios\" continued decade after decade, and the\r\nexhibition of each of his pictures was the signal for a battle. \"No work\r\nof his,\" writes Thoré, \"but called forth deafening howls, curses, and\r\nfurious controversy. Insults were heaped upon the artist, coarser and\r\nmore opprobrious than one would be justified in applying to a sharper.\"\r\nAt Charenton, where he was born, is the Bedlam of France. Hence the\r\nepithet continually hurled at him by the critics, who called him the\r\nrunaway from Charenton.\r\n\r\nUntil the year 1847 his pictures could without difficulty be excluded\r\nfrom the Salon. He irritated people by his violence, by the abruptness\r\nof his compositions, by his arrangement of figures with a view to pathos\r\nat the expense of plastic elegance; he displeased by the incompleteness\r\nof his works, which were regarded as sketches, not finished paintings.\r\nWhen Louis Philippe ordered a picture from his brush, it was on the\r\nexpress condition that it should be as little a Delacroix as possible.\r\nThere was general ill-humour among the academicians when, at Thiers'\r\nsuggestion, he was commissioned to decorate the Palais Bourbon. And\r\nDelacroix, ambitious and sensitive as he was, was deeply hurt by every\r\nmortification of this kind, and affected by every gust of criticism as\r\nby a change of wind. Continually denounced in the newspapers, attacked,\r\nwounded, delivered over to the wild beasts, as he called it, he never\r\nhad a moment of rest--he who, with his irritable temperament and fragile\r\nhealth, needed rest more than any man. It was not until almost all his\r\nworks were brought together in the Universal Exhibition of 1885 that it\r\nbecame evident how great an artist this Delacroix was, whom his country\r\nfor forty years had not understood, and to whom the Institute had closed\r\nits doors to the last. Yet he was no sooner dead than all with one voice\r\nproclaimed him a genius; his smallest drawing is to-day worth its weight\r\nin gold, while during his lifetime he seldom got more than two thousand\r\nfrancs for his largest paintings. His sketches, great works in small\r\nframes, have for the most part found their way to America. The sale of\r\nthe pictures he left behind him produced three hundred and sixty\r\nthousand francs.\r\n\r\nDelacroix, therefore, was victorious, but not as Rubens was; and his\r\nceiling of the Louvre, with the \"Triumph of Apollo,\" one of his most\r\nremarkable works, strikes one almost as an allegory of his own life.\r\nWhat especially attracted and inspired the artist in this painting were\r\nthe spasms and convulsions of the misshapen monsters which the god\r\nexpels from the earth--the serpent twisting itself in movements of pain\r\nand fury, raising its head on high, hissing rage, and vomiting venom and\r\nblood. The god himself, who in the midst of a sea of light ascends into\r\nheaven in a golden chariot drawn by radiant steeds, shows in his sturdy\r\nlimbs and attitude ready for defence, and in his wrathful face, no trace\r\nof the proud majesty and joyous splendour which Greece connected with\r\nthe name of Apollo. He is a mortal who has fought and conquered, not a\r\ngod who triumphs in tranquil power. He is Delacroix, not Rubens; a\r\nTitan, not an Olympian god.\r\n\r\nThe artistic power in Delacroix could in no wise submit to the\r\nconfinement imposed by the French spirit of his time. It was not\r\npossible for a single man, though endowed with the most splendid\r\ncourage, to overthrow in a moment all the traditions of French art. Any\r\none who knows the French must feel that David's Latin style could not so\r\nsuddenly disappear out of their art, that it was not possible at a blow\r\nto banish all that had hitherto held sway and to replace it by its\r\nopposite. Ever since Poussin they had sought in Roman antiquity the\r\nformulæ of their art. The predilection which the Parisians have even\r\nto-day for the representation of Racine's and Corneille's tragedies, the\r\nadmiration which even the most extreme Naturalists bestow upon Poussin\r\nand Lesueur, prove abundantly how deep Classicism is rooted in the flesh\r\nand blood of the French people. Brandes has remarked, very acutely,\r\nthat, strictly speaking, even Romanticism was on French soil in many\r\nrespects a Classical phenomenon, a product of French Classical rhetoric.\r\n\"They never saw the dances of the elves, never heard the delicate\r\nharmony of their roundelays.\" In Victor Hugo, the great opponent of\r\nCorneille, Corneille himself was re-embodied. He too is a draughtsman,\r\nconstructs his poems like architectural works, chisels the form,\r\npolishes the verse, and confines his colouring within powerfully\r\nconceived Michelangelesque outlines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. A. D. INGRES.   _L'Art._]\r\n\r\nOnce the first eager impulse of the Romantic school had subsided, these\r\nold Classical tendencies showed themselves anew and with all the greater\r\nvehemence. Even Hugo's dramas, with their predilection for all that is\r\nexuberant and monstrous, with their overflowing lyricism and sonorous\r\npathos, became in the long run wearisome. He, who had hitherto been the\r\nidol of the young generation, was now called the Pater Bombasticus of\r\nthe literature of the world.\r\n\r\nClassicism found its poet and its muse. An unknown but very worthy young\r\nman, not endowed with wealth of imagination, but imbued with the most\r\nhonourable intentions, came to Paris from the provincial town where he\r\nhad grown to manhood, with a manuscript in his pocket. And François\r\nRonsard's _Lucrèce_, a tragedy from the antique, in its style sober and\r\nsevere, reminding one of Racine, was represented amid thunders of\r\napplause, shortly after Hugo had been hissed off the stage. Enthusiastic\r\nadmirers saw in it a glorious return to the great tragic drama of\r\nFrance, an emanation from the spirit of Corneille, and praised its\r\nclear, measured, and at once \"classic and familiar\" language. Together\r\nwith its poet, the Classical reaction found its actress. In 1838 a young\r\nuntrained child made her début at the Théâtre Français--a Jewish girl\r\nwho had sung in the streets to the accompaniment of her harp. Rachel\r\nappeared upon the boards, and restored its former power of attraction to\r\nthe old Classical repertoire, to the very tragedies which the Romantic\r\nschool had banished from the theatre amid mockery and derision. _The\r\nCid_, _Mérope_, _Chimène_, and _Phèdre_ recovered their place upon the\r\nstage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  INGRES.   THE MAID OF ORLEANS AT RHEIMS.]\r\n\r\nPainting took the same course. In opposition to the young painters who\r\nhad burst into the arena with their gay-coloured uniforms, their gilded\r\nhelmets and waving banners, _Ingres_ came forth in the great tournament\r\nof Romanticism in the character of the Black Knight. An old gentleman, a\r\nman who in all his being belonged to the generation that was passing\r\naway, who was fifty years of age at the time of the Revolution of July,\r\nstations himself suddenly as the angel of the flaming sword, or, in the\r\nphrase of his opponents, as the gendarme of Classicism, at the gates of\r\nthe Academy, barring them against every suspicious-looking person. And\r\nthe young men, eccentric, eager for action as they were, who had\r\nrecently fought with so much fury, had to retreat before him. Golden\r\nsunshine and glow of colour were once more tabooed, and their\r\nrepresentative heroes, Veronese, Rubens, and Delacroix, regarded as\r\nflickering Will o' the Wisps, whom every aspiring beginner should avoid\r\nas serpents and firebrands. One day when Ingres was taking his pupils\r\nthrough the Louvre he said, on entering the Rubens gallery: \"_Saluez,\r\nmessieurs, mais ne regardez pas._\" The acrimony of the strife was so\r\ngreat that it extended even to the personal relations of the rival\r\nchiefs, and Ingres was attacked by convulsive spasms whenever he heard\r\nthe name of the painter of the \"Massacre of Chios.\" When in 1855 he had\r\nhad a separate room prepared for his own pictures in the Universal\r\nExhibition of that year, and observed Delacroix in the distance, just\r\nbefore the opening ceremony, he asked the attendant: \"Has not somebody\r\nbeen here?--there is a smell of brimstone.\" \"Now the wolf is in the\r\nsheepfold\" was his observation when Delacroix was elected to the\r\nInstitute. He regarded him as the \"hangman,\" as the Robespierre of\r\npainting. \"I used to love that young man, but he has sold himself to the\r\nevil one\" (Rubens), said he, in righteous indignation, to his pupils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INGRES.   PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF AS A YOUTH.]\r\n\r\n\"This famous thing, the Beautiful,\" Delacroix had once written, \"must\r\nbe--every one says so--the final aim of art. But if it be the only aim,\r\nwhat then are we to make of men like Rubens, Rembrandt, and, in general,\r\nall the artistic natures of the North, who preferred other qualities\r\nbelonging to their art? Is the sense of the beautiful that impression\r\nwhich is made upon us by a picture by Velasquez, an etching by\r\nRembrandt, or a scene out of Shakespeare? Or again, is the beautiful\r\nrevealed to us by the contemplation of the straight noses and correctly\r\ndisposed draperies of Girodet, Gérard, and others of David's pupils? A\r\nsatyr is beautiful, a faun is beautiful. The antique bust of Socrates is\r\nfull of character, notwithstanding its flattened nose, swollen lips, and\r\nsmall eyes. In Paul Veronese's 'Marriage at Cana' I see men of various\r\nfeatures and of every temperament, and I find them to be living beings,\r\nfull of passion. Are they beautiful? Perhaps. But in any case there is\r\nno recipe by means of which one can attain to what is called the ideally\r\nbeautiful. Style depends absolutely and solely upon the free and\r\noriginal expression of each master's peculiar qualities. Wherever a\r\npainter sets himself to follow a conventional mode of expression he will\r\nbecome affected and will lose his own peculiar impress; but where, on\r\nthe contrary, he frankly abandons himself to the impulse of his own\r\noriginality, he will ever, whether his name be Raphael, Michael Angelo,\r\nRubens, or Rembrandt, be sure master of his soul and of his art.\"\r\n\r\nAs compared with the principles thus laid down, Ingres represents the\r\nrevulsion towards that formalism which had borne sway over the greater\r\npart of the history of French art. \"Painting is nothing more than\r\ndrawing,\" said Poussin. \"Had God intended to place colour at the same\r\nheight as form,\" wrote Charles Blanc, \"He would not have failed to\r\nfurnish His masterpiece, Man, with all the hues of the humming-bird.\"\r\nOnce more, instead of the glowing colour of the Romantic school,\r\nabsorbing the form into itself, the firm stroke of the outline was set\r\nforth; instead of its pathos, breathing forth passionate emotion, men\r\nreturned to study the chill tranquillity of stone. Once more dramatic\r\ncomposition and mastery over movement were held in abhorrence, as\r\nincompatible with that pursuit of plastic beauty which was the highest\r\ngoal of art. The only point in question was, how to avoid the\r\none-sidedness of Classicism. David, as a child of the Revolution, had\r\nnaturally been limited to Ancient Rome; but now that the legitimate\r\nmonarchy had been re-established there was no reason why one should not\r\nrevere, not only pagan, but also Christian Rome, and in Raphael and\r\nMichael Angelo the maturest blossom of the latter. Thus the Classical\r\nschool was enriched by Ingres with features of greater vivacity. He\r\nentered into a direct relationship with the great Italian masters, while\r\nDavid had none save with the rigid Roman antique. By him the Classical\r\nseverity of David was relaxed, the refractory sharpness of the outlines\r\nrelieved by a treatment of form which had the effect of making every\r\nfigure appear to be worked in metal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INGRES.   BERTIN THE ELDER.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Jules Bapst, the owner of the picture._)]\r\n\r\nIngres was born in 1781, under the _Ancien Régime_. As a young man he\r\nlived through the triumphs of the Empire and the Classical school, and\r\nit was only natural that he should become David's pupil. In 1796 he\r\nentered his studio, and studied there with such assiduity that he never\r\nnoticed what was taking place in that of Gros. When he went to Italy he\r\nstudied there the masters whom his own teacher had arrogantly despised.\r\nHe learned from the Cinquecento how to draw and model more accurately,\r\nmore firmly, and at the same time with a more intimate grasp of the\r\nsubject than was usual in the school of David. This innovation made him\r\na progressive Classicist, and gave him, during the early years of the\r\nRestoration, almost the appearance of an assailant and revolutionary.\r\nHimself the incarnation of the academic spirit, he had to resign himself\r\nto see his first works rejected by the Salon, a fact which did not deter\r\nhim from continuing to work obstinately at his easel. \"_Je compte sur ma\r\nvieillesse; elle me vengea._\" And this revenge was granted him in the\r\nfullest measure.\r\n\r\nWhen one has seen the outward appearance of a man, one knows his\r\ncharacter, his spirit, and his genius. Ingres' portrait of himself\r\ncontains the analysis of his art. He was quite a small man, of a swarthy\r\ncomplexion, with features sharp and as if cast in bronze. His thick\r\nblack hair stood up stubbornly on end, so that he had to grease it\r\ncarefully every day. Under hair of this kind there is almost always an\r\nobstinate brain. The jaws projected, as is the case with men endowed\r\nwith a strong will. The eyes were large and piercing, with that bold\r\neagle-glance which fills parents with fond hopes, but does not touch the\r\nhearts of young women. When he appeared to be excited, it was only the\r\nexcitement of work expressing itself in him. This little man, in his\r\nlarge cloak, seemed to say when he stood at his easel, pencil in hand:\r\n\"I shall be a great painter, for I am determined to be one.\" He kept his\r\nword. Strength of will, hard work, study, obstinacy, patience--these are\r\nthe elements of which Ingres' talent is compounded. \"_Vouloir, c'est\r\npouvoir_,\" was his motto. One would think Buffon had had him in mind in\r\nthat passage in which he defines genius as patience. The\r\ntrinity-in-unity of his qualities consisted of correctness, balance,\r\nexactness; qualities which go to make rather a great architect or\r\nmathematician than an interesting painter.\r\n\r\nIngres' range of subjects was unusually wide. Pictures on themes taken\r\nfrom antiquity (\"Oedipus and the Sphinx\" and \"Virgil reading the\r\nÆneid\"); costume pictures (\"Henry IV and his Children\" and the \"Entry of\r\nCharles V into Paris\"); religious paintings (Madonnas, \"Christ giving\r\nthe Keys to St. Peter,\" and \"St. Symphorian\"); nude female figures (the\r\n\"Odalisque,\" the \"Liberation of Angelica,\" and \"The Source\"); allegories\r\n(\"The Apotheosis of Homer\" and \"The Apotheosis of Napoleon\"); pictures\r\nof public functions (\"Bonaparte as First Consul\" and \"Napoleon on the\r\nThrone\"); and even a painting taken from the life (\"Pius VII in the\r\nSistine Chapel\"), are included in the list. Yet, notwithstanding his\r\nastonishing diversity of themes, there is hardly an artist more\r\none-sided in his principles. Ingres thought exclusively of purely\r\nplastic art: beauty of form and harmony of line alone attracted him; he\r\nwas insensible to the charm of colour. His standpoint was the Institute\r\nof Rome; the Italian Cinquecento the exclusive object of his worship. He\r\ncarried this study as far as plagiarism, and as director of the Roman\r\nAcademy made free with the intellectual property of the Cinquecento\r\nmasters, as if they had lived only on his account.\r\n\r\nWhen Delacroix was painting the \"Expulsion of Heliodorus\" in Saint\r\nSulpice, he put forth the whole strength of his creative genius to\r\navoid all reminiscence of Raphael's fresco. Ingres' power of invention\r\nconsisted in discovering, with a weird certainty, whether the subject of\r\nwhich he wished to treat had already been painted by an Italian or other\r\nClassical master. The picture \"Jupiter and Thetis,\" of 1811, is put\r\ntogether after a design on a Greek vase, and represents in its studied\r\narchaism the Æginetan period of his art. The \"Vow of Louis XIII,\" of\r\n1824, was his confession of faith as regards the Cinquecento. The motive\r\nwas taken from the Madonna di Foligno, the curtains from the Madonna di\r\nSan Sisto, the floating angels from the Madonna del Baldacchino, and the\r\ncandlesticks as well as the little angels with the inscribed tablet are\r\nfrom the same source. It is all beautiful, of course, for it is all\r\nRaphael; only, it would have been more rational if Ingres had lived in\r\nthe time of Raphael instead of in the nineteenth century. One would take\r\nthe picture to have been painted under Raphael's eyes, and it bears to\r\nhis works the same relation as Raphael's earlier pictures do to\r\nPerugino's. The \"Christ giving the Keys to St. Peter\" is also put\r\ntogether out of elements derived from the school of Urbino. In his \"St.\r\nSymphorian,\" which was belauded as the _ne plus ultra_ of style, he\r\nturned by way of variety to the imitation of Michael Angelo: the action\r\nis violent, the muscles swollen. The \"Apotheosis of Homer\" is an\r\nadmirable lecture in archæology, a sitting of the great academy of\r\ngenius, in which the poses are so fine and the heads so full of marble\r\nidealism that in comparison with it Raphael's \"School of Athens\" has the\r\neffect of the wildest naturalism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  INGRES.   STUDY FOR THE ODALISQUE IN THE LOUVRE.]\r\n\r\nThus Father Ingres stands forth as a cold, stiff, academic painter, as a\r\ndoctrinaire who has not progressed much further than the much-reviled\r\nDavid. He represents, as Th. Rousseau said, only to a moderate degree\r\nthe good old art which we have lost. In the words of Diaz: \"Let him be\r\nshut up with me in a tower, without engravings, and I wager that his\r\ncanvas will remain untouched, whilst I shall succeed in producing a\r\npicture.\" He possessed an arid ability which leaves one cold in presence\r\nof even his most important works. How lifeless is the effect produced by\r\nhis paintings of nude single figures, his \"Odalisque\" and his \"Freeing\r\nof Andromeda,\" which brought him especial fame! Ingres could not paint\r\nflesh, and in this respect he is indicative of an enormous retrogression\r\nas compared with Prudhon. The striving after sculpturesque beauty, and,\r\nin connection therewith, the repression of all individuality, became in\r\nhim almost a religion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  INGRES.   THE SOURCE.]\r\n\r\nOne finds it difficult to-day to account for the fame which once\r\nbelonged to his picture of \"The Source,\" the nude figure of a standing\r\ngirl pouring water out of an urn that rests on her left shoulder and is\r\nsteadied by her right arm raised over her head. The picture undoubtedly\r\nexhibits qualities of draughtsmanship which in recent days Ingres alone\r\npossessed in so high a degree. But when, in pursuit of his Classical\r\nconception, he had eliminated every touch of nature, he proceeded to\r\ndestroy the rest of the impression by the cold violet tones which are\r\nnot only condemned by colourists, but which even Raphael would have\r\nconsidered false and ugly. Here, as in all his female figures, he\r\nattains to a certain grace, but it is an animal, expressionless grace.\r\nSkilful as he was in delineating the muscles of the human body, he was\r\nyet absolutely incapable of painting heads expressive of feeling or\r\nemotion. He depicted the form in itself, the abstract, typical, absolute\r\nform. He was dominated only by a love for the _beauté suprême_, so that\r\nwhen he was in presence of nature he could not refrain from purifying\r\nand generalising. Everywhere we see beautiful lines, bodies modelled\r\nwith admirable skill, but we never enter into any closer relationship\r\nwith his figures. They do not live our life or breathe our atmosphere;\r\nthey have not our thoughts: they are foreign to all that is human. Jean\r\nAuguste Dominique Ingres, Member of the Institute, Senator, etc., the\r\nstylist held in honour as a superior being, the high-priest of pure form\r\nand outline, will in all times command the esteem, and in some respects\r\nthe admiration, of the student of the history of art; the enthusiasm,\r\nnever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet_.\r\n\r\n  INGRES.   OEDIPUS AND THE SPHINX.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  INGRES.   PAGANINI.]\r\n\r\nAnd yet, notwithstanding all this, I am an enthusiastic admirer of\r\nIngres. Indeed, it has happened to me, in the collection of engravings\r\nat the Louvre, to catch myself saying: \"Ingres! great, beloved Master! I\r\nhave much to ask your pardon; for you were one of the greatest and most\r\nrefined spirits to whom the century has given birth.\" For I doubt\r\nwhether any one down to the present time has rightly understood the\r\nmysterious figure of Ingres, the man who in his youth was enraptured by\r\n\"_l'esprit, la grâce, l'originalité de Vataux et la délicieuse couleur\r\nde ses tableaux_,\" and who, at a later time, not because of failing\r\npowers but deliberately and of set purpose, adopted a calmer system of\r\ncolour tones; of this Classicist _par excellence_, who is counted among\r\nthe greatest artists, in the familiar and graceful style, in the history\r\nof art.\r\n\r\nIngres is one of the rare masters whom even their opponents are forced\r\nto admire. In the stern, sculpturesque modelling of his naked figures he\r\ndisplays remarkable power. His painting, also, has a curiously intimate\r\nappeal, due to its cool, metallic harmonies of colour--light blue, rose,\r\nand pale yellow in particular.\r\n\r\nBut above all Ingres commands attention by his portraits. From his first\r\nresidence at Rome, that is, from the beginning of the century, he\r\npainted portraits which imprint themselves on the memory like medals\r\nstruck in metallic sharpness in the style of Mantegna. Here too he is\r\nunequal, at times cold and commonplace, but usually quite admirable. In\r\nthese paintings, cast as it were in bronze, there is something that\r\ncomes from the fresh original source of all art; they have that vein of\r\nrealism by which the vigorous idealism of Raphael is distinguished from\r\nthe conventional idealism of a professor of historical painting. Here\r\none finds real treasures, creations of remarkable vital power, and in\r\nadmirable taste. They show that Ingres, apparently so systematic, had a\r\nprofound love for living nature, and they ensure the immortality of his\r\nname. His historical pictures are works which compel our esteem, but his\r\nportraits are splendid creations which can truly stand comparison with\r\nthe great old masters.\r\n\r\nSo far back as 1806 there appeared in the Salon his likeness of Napoleon\r\nI, with his bloodless, corpse-like face, enchased with such art that\r\nDelécluze called it a Gothic medal. The Emperor is seated like a wax\r\nfigure upon the throne, surrounded by the attributes of majesty--stiff,\r\nmotionless as a Byzantine idol. It was followed in 1807 by the portrait\r\nof Mme. Devauçay, which even to-day impresses the beholder most\r\npleasingly, notwithstanding the pedantic style in which it is painted.\r\nOne feels in it fire and youthfulness, the enthusiasm and ardour of a\r\nnew convert, who has for the first time discovered in nature beauties\r\nother than those he had learnt to see in the Academy. Moreover, he\r\npossessed a very distinguished and personal taste in drawing. The face\r\nis of exquisite grace, the eyes tenderly seductive and delicately\r\nveiled. Ingres is already announced as he was afterwards to be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  INGRES.   MLLE. DE MONTGOLFIER.]\r\n\r\nIn Holbein's portraits the whole German community of his time has been\r\nhanded down to us; in Van Dyck's, the aristocracy of England under\r\nCharles I. So also Ingres has depicted for us, with all its failings and\r\nall its virtues, the middle-class hierarchy of Louis Philippe's reign,\r\nwhich felt itself to be the first estate, the summit of the nation, felt\r\nsure of the morrow, was proud of itself, of its intelligence and energy,\r\nwhich pursued with correctness its moral course of life, revered order\r\nand hated all excess--including that of the colourist. The same spirit\r\nanimated this splendid _bourgeois_ of art. His \"Bertin the Elder\" is\r\njustly his most celebrated, enduring work; not the mere painted\r\npetrifaction of a newspaper potentate, but one of those portraits which\r\nbring a whole epoch home to the mind. It tells of the triumph of the\r\n_bourgeoisie_ under the Monarchy of July more fully and clearly than\r\ndoes Louis Blanc's _Histoire de Dix Ans_. In the best of humours, with\r\nthe four-square solidity of a knowledge of his own worth, which is full\r\nof character, this modern newspaper demi-god sits on his chair as on a\r\nthrone, the throne of the _Journal des Débats_, like a _bourgeois_\r\nJupiter Tonans, with his hands on his knees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  INGRES.   THE FORESTIER FAMILY.]\r\n\r\nBut however highly one must estimate the importance of such a work,\r\nIngres is nevertheless at his highest, not in his painted likenesses,\r\nbut in his portrait drawings. In the former the hard colouring is still,\r\nat times, offensive. Almost always the flesh looks like wood, the dress\r\nlike metal, blue robes like steel. His drawings, from which this defect\r\nis absent, are to be admired without criticism. Ingres lived in his\r\nyouth, at Rome, as a drawer of portraits. For eight _scudi_ he did the\r\nbust, for twelve the whole figure, raging inwardly the while at being\r\nkept from \"great art\" by such journey-work. There is a story told of\r\nhim, that when one day an Englishman knocked at his door and asked,\r\n\"Does the draughtsman who makes the small portraits live here?\" he shut\r\nthe door in his face, with the words: \"No; he who lives here is a\r\npainter.\" To-day these small masterpieces of which he was ashamed sell\r\nfor their weight in gold. In the Paris Exhibition of 1889 there was Mme.\r\nChauvin with her Chinese eyes; Mme. Besnard on the terrace of the Pincio\r\nwith her broad hat and her elegant sunshade; Mrs. Henting with her\r\ninnocent smile of an \"_honnête femme_\"; Mrs. Cavendish, an affected\r\nyoung blonde, with her overladen travelling dress and her crazy\r\ncoiffure. Strange, that a man like Ingres should rave so about new\r\nfashions and pretty toilettes!\r\n\r\nIn these pieces an artistic eye which was now inexorable, now tender and\r\nfull of fancy, has looked on nature, and, in flowing pencil-strokes, has\r\ncaught with spirit and with the certain touch of direct feeling the real\r\nfulness of life in what he saw. These drawings, especially the portrait\r\nof Paganini and \"The Forestier Family,\" show that Father Ingres\r\npossessed not only a highly cultivated intelligence and an iron strength\r\nof will, not only the genius of industry, but also a heart, a genuine,\r\nwarm, and fine-feeling heart; that he was in his innermost being by no\r\nmeans the cold academician, the stiff doctrinaire he appears in his\r\nlarge pictures, and which he became by his opposition to the Romantic\r\nschool. Here we have an enchanter such as the Primitives were and the\r\nImpressionists are, like Massys and Manet, like Dürer and Degas, like\r\nall who have looked Nature in the face. And while these drawings, at\r\nonce occasional and austere, place him as a draughtsman on a level with\r\nthe greatest masters in the history of art, they also show him, the\r\nreactionary, to be at the same time a man of progress, the connecting\r\nlink between the great art of the first half and the familiar art which\r\nrules over the second half of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nJUSTE-MILIEU\r\n\r\n\r\nAs is usually the case, the heroes were succeeded by a generation less\r\nheroic and more practical. In this, art was in keeping with the\r\ndeliberate and tranquil course of the state itself, which had fallen\r\nback again into the old groove, and with the homely, Philistine\r\ncharacter assumed in the course of years by the citizen monarchy of the\r\ntricolour. The _bourgeoisie_ which had effected the Revolution of 1830\r\nwas soon appalled at its own temerity. Even in literature it inclined\r\ntowards a temperate and lukewarm mediocrity. It was astonished to find\r\nitself admiring Casimir Delavigne. It found in Auber and Scribe its\r\nideal of music and comedy, as in Guizot, Duchâtel, Thiers, and Odilon\r\nBarrot its ideal of politics. The intellectual exaltation which had gone\r\nbefore and followed after the Revolution of July had calmed down, and\r\nthat which was to rise out of the Revolution of February was as yet\r\nlatent. The same elder generation which had looked upon Napoleon\r\nBonaparte's stony Cæsarian eye, when, like a god of war, unapproachable\r\nin his power he rode by at the head of his staff, now saw the Roi\r\nCitoyen, the long-exiled ex-school-master, homely and fond of law and\r\norder, as every day at the same hour he passed alone on foot and in\r\nplain clothes through the streets of Paris, the famous umbrella in his\r\nhand, rewarding each \"Vive le Roi!\" with a friendly smile and a grateful\r\nhand-shake. The umbrella became the symbol of this deedless monarchy,\r\nand the word \"Juste-milieu,\" which Louis Philippe had once employed to\r\nindicate the course to be followed, became the nickname of all that was\r\nweak and without energy, lustreless and undignified, in the age. The\r\ngolden mean was triumphant in politics, literature, and painting.\r\n\r\nThe artists who gave this period its peculiar stamp constitute, as\r\ncompared with the heaven-assaulting generation of 1830, only, as it\r\nwere, a collateral female branch of that elder male line of good\r\npainting. To reconcile opposite tendencies, to avoid harshness, in\r\nshort, to bring about an artistic compromise between Ingres and\r\nDelacroix, was the end towards which their efforts were chiefly\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\n_Jean Gigoux_, a remarkable artist, has the merit of having given the\r\nmost effective support which Delacroix received in his battle against\r\nthe _beauté suprême_ of the Classical school. When, in the Universal\r\nExhibition of 1889 at Paris, his picture of \"The Last Moments of\r\nLeonardo da Vinci,\" painted in 1835, emerged from the seclusion of a\r\nprovincial museum, its healthy fidelity to nature was the cause of\r\ngeneral astonishment. The personages indeed wear costly costumes, and\r\nare surrounded by wealth and magnificence, but they themselves are\r\ncommon, ugly human beings. Here there is no trace of idealism, not even\r\nin the sense of Géricault, who, notwithstanding his love of truth,\r\nremained faithful to the heroic type. The faces are, with religious\r\ndevotion, painted exactly after nature by a man who evidently loved the\r\nyouthful works of Guercino and had zealously studied Dürer. At the same\r\ntime was exhibited the portrait of the Polish \"General Dwernicki,\"\r\npainted in 1833, whom also Gigoux depicts as a man, not as a hero. War\r\nhas made him not lean but fat, and in Gigoux's picture his red nose and\r\nprominent stomach are reproduced with cruel fidelity to nature. It is a\r\ndeclaration of war against every kind of idealism. Even in his religious\r\npaintings in Saint Germain l'Auxerrois he held fast to this principle,\r\nand this circumstance gives him a place to himself, apart from all the\r\nproductions of his contemporaries. In a period which, with the solitary\r\nexception of Delacroix, was still absolutely devoted to the doctrine\r\n_Exagérer la beauté_, his works are of a healthy, soul-refreshing\r\nugliness.\r\n\r\nA portion of Delacroix's charm in colour descended to _Eugène Isabey_.\r\nHe is certainly not a great artist, but a delightful, sympathetic\r\nindividuality, a painter who affords one pleasure even at this day. Amid\r\nthe group of Classicists of his time he has the effect of a beautiful\r\npatch of colour, of a palette on which shades of tender blue, mauve,\r\nlilac, brilliant green, silver-grey, red faded by sunshine, and\r\nopalescent mother-of-pearl combine in subtle harmony. His pretty,\r\npicturesquely costumed ladies are grouped together in luminous gardens,\r\nsheltered by delicate half-shadows, or ascend and descend the castle\r\nstairs, letting their long trains sweep behind them, and toying\r\ngracefully with fan or sunshade; while gallant cavaliers do them homage,\r\nand with bent head whisper sweet nothings in their ears. The slender\r\ngreyhound plays a special part in these aristocratic comedies; its\r\nstraight lines give a counterpoise to the soft flowing costumes of his\r\nfigures. Isabey is altogether in his element when he has to portray a\r\nceremony requiring rich attire. Then he binds together, as it were, a\r\nbouquet sparkling with colour, shot with the hues of ample damask folds\r\nand heavy gold-embroidered silk. Now his colouring is _chic_,\r\ncapricious, and coquettish, now it is that of the most delicate faded\r\nGobelin tapestry. If he has to paint a sea-view, he rumples the waves\r\nabout like a ball-dress and pranks the ships up in bridal attire. His\r\nvery storms have a festal appearance, like the anger of a beautiful\r\nwoman. One must not look for life in his pictures; they are to the truth\r\nmuch what Gounod's _Faust_ is to Goethe's. Watteau is his spiritual\r\nancestor; but he is not so full of life and wit as the painter of the\r\ngallant world of the eighteenth century. He does not depict his\r\ncontemporaries, but the life of a vanished age; yet he has the same\r\npredilection for scenes of high life, and a studied, mannered\r\ngracefulness which is often charming and always pleasant to the eye. He\r\nshares with Delacroix the latter's broad style, freedom from constraint,\r\nand delight in colour. But where Delacroix is rough and violent, Isabey\r\nis caressing and insinuating: they are not brothers, but distant\r\ncousins. And, like Delacroix, he had no imitators; he went on his bright\r\nand delightful path in solitude, and remained without companions in the\r\nlittle gilded house, lit up with fantastic lanterns, which he assigned\r\nto be the coquettish home of charming beings of both sexes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARY SCHEFFER.   _L'Art._]\r\n\r\nA curious position, half-way between the Romantic and the Classical\r\nschools, was occupied by _Ary Scheffer_, who was, a generation ago, the\r\nfavourite of the greater part of the aristocracy of Europe, but is now\r\nknown, to the German public at least, only because he is said to have\r\npainted \"with snuff and green soap\"--a phrase of Heine's, which,\r\nhowever, gives a very false impression of him. A German-Dutchman by\r\nbirth, a Classicist by training, Scheffer in his youth came also in\r\ncontact with the leading spirits of the Romantic school; and these\r\nvarious influences, of race, education, and intercourse, are clearly\r\nreflected in the faces of his figures. His forms are thoroughly classic\r\nand generalised; only the expression of the face is ideal, while the eye\r\nis romantic, and, Scheffer's German blood making itself\r\nfelt--sentimental. It was precisely this mid-way position which his\r\ncontemporaries found so much to their liking. They called his painting a\r\ngreat art full of style, uniting the sentiment of ideal beauty with a\r\ncaptivating power of expression. But history cares but little for these\r\nmen of compromise, and regards this indecision as the chief defect of\r\nhis genius. Scheffer's draughtsmanship is dry and hard, his colouring\r\nwithout tenderness or charm. These failings are ill-assorted with the\r\nattitudes and physiognomy of his figures, which have always an\r\naffectation of weakness, exhaustion, and moral suffering. He is a\r\nsentimental Classicist, and his subjects the antithesis of the\r\nGræco-Roman ideal to which he does homage in his technique. His \"Suliote\r\nWomen\" was already, in sentiment, form, and colour, only a subdued and\r\nweakened reminiscence of the \"Massacre of Chios.\" At a later time he\r\nentirely forsook historical subjects (such as \"Gaston de Foix\" and\r\nothers), and attached himself with enthusiasm to the Gospels and to the\r\nworks of the poets, especially of one poet. When he had recourse to the\r\nBible as a source of inspiration, he selected tender episodes, the\r\nsadness of which he transmuted into tearfulness. So also, when he\r\nrepresented scenes from _Faust_ or _Wilhelm Meister_, he gave to\r\nGoethe's animated and impassioned characters something melancholy,\r\nsuffering, and contemplative. Heine said of his \"Gretchen\": \"You are no\r\ndoubt Wolfgang Goethe's Gretchen, but you have read all Friedrich\r\nSchiller.\" Even before her fall, before she is in love, Marguerite is\r\npensive and sad like a fallen angel. Mignon, Francesca da Rimini, and\r\nSt. Monica were also favourite figures for his delicate and\r\ncontemplative spirit. He alone in French art inclines a little, in his\r\ntearful sentimentality, to the Romantic school of Düsseldorf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  ARY SCHEFFER.   MARGUERITE AT THE WELL.]\r\n\r\n_Hippolyte Flandrin_ was the French counterpart of the German Nazarenes.\r\nHe is an example of how Ingres' teaching resulted in stiff\r\nconventionality. Ingres was a dangerous master to follow. His pupils\r\nformed round him a small, faithful, and submissive band, swore like\r\nthose of Cornelius by the master's doctrines, and for that very reason\r\nnever attained to any distinctive character of their own. None of them\r\npossessed Ingres' many-sided talent. His empire, like that of Alexander\r\nthe Great, was divided among his successors, each of whom governed his\r\nown little realm with greater or less ability. Hippolyte Flandrin\r\ndevoted himself to religious painting, which in his hands for the first\r\ntime regained a greater importance in French art; but he followed much\r\nmore slavishly than Ingres in the paths of the Italian masters of the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries. This painter, worthy of respect,\r\nfull of conviction, learned and of sterling worth, but colourless and\r\ncold, who decorated the churches of St. Vincent de Paul and St. Germain\r\ndes Prés, has enriched the history of art by no new gift. An\r\nindefatigable worker, but endowed with little intellectual power, he\r\nwent no further than to follow out strictly the rules which Ingres\r\ntaught his pupils and had himself acquired from the old masters. After\r\nFlandrin, as winner of the Prix de Rome in 1831, had become intimately\r\nacquainted with the art treasures of Italy, he seldom met with any\r\ndifficulty. His cartoons are flowingly and correctly executed with a\r\nfirm hand, like the fair copy of a school essay. Of draughtsmanship he\r\nknew all that is to be learned; he remembered much, arranged his\r\nreminiscences, and thought little for himself. He was a miniature copy\r\nof his master, at once more poorly endowed and more fanatical, a purely\r\nmathematical genius; his art is a cold geometrical knowledge, the\r\nadaptation of anatomical studies to conventional forms, an arrangement\r\nof groups and draperies in strict accordance with celebrated exemplars.\r\nHad not the primitive Italian masters, the painters of the ancient\r\nChristian catacombs, the saintly Fra Angelico, and the mosaic artists of\r\nRavenna done their work long before him, Flandrin's paintings would\r\nnever have seen the light, any more than those of the Nazarene school.\r\nIn both cases one can assign almost every face and figure to its\r\noriginal in the pictures of the Italian masters. Only a certain blond,\r\ntender, slightly melancholy, modern face of a Christian maiden is\r\nFlandrin's peculiar property. He transferred these same ascetic and pure\r\nprinciples to portrait painting, and thereby acquired for himself a\r\nlarge practice as the painter of the _femme honnête_. These women\r\nconversed with him and blushed in his presence; in his pictures we find\r\ngrace and delicacy, eyes sparkling or meek, tenderness and mocking\r\nlaughter, all translated into a nun-like, unapproachable appearance,\r\nwhich under the Second Empire gained the greater approbation among\r\nladies, since it was seldom found in real life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  CHASSERIAU.   APOLLO AND DAPHNE.]\r\n\r\nAlongside of this Overbeck, endowed with greater artistic powers than\r\nhis German congener, there stands as the French Cornelius _Paul\r\nChenavard_, a man who revolved in his fertile brain philosophical\r\nconceptions deeper almost than those of the German master. He dreamed of\r\nbroad, symbolical, decorative pieces, embracing all time and all space,\r\nwherein all the cosmogonies of the universe should be united. Like\r\nCornelius, he wished to be a Michael Angelo, but he succeeded no better\r\nthan the German. He spent fifteen years in the churches and museums of\r\nItaly, pencil in hand, accumulating a vast collection of studies, from\r\nwhich his great painted history of the world was to be built up. But\r\nwhen he went back to Paris his materials from the old masters had grown\r\nupon him to such an extent that he never recovered his individuality.\r\nFor four years he worked with feverish diligence, and completed eighteen\r\ncartoons, each six metres in height and four in breadth, intended for\r\nthe walls of the Pantheon. So far as colour is concerned, they have\r\nattained no greater success than the Campo Santo frescoes of Cornelius.\r\nChenavard could draw much better than the German, but was not much\r\nbetter as a painter; the works of both have a literary rather than an\r\nartistic value.\r\n\r\nBrief and brilliant was the career of _Théodore Chassériau_, who shot\r\nacross the heavens of art like a gleaming meteor, first as a devotee of\r\nform, in Ingres' sense of the word, and afterwards, like Delacroix, as\r\nan enthusiastic lover of sunshine and the clear light of Africa. Born in\r\n1819 at St. Domingo, he followed his teacher Ingres in 1834 to the Villa\r\nMedici; but even in his first picture, the \"Susanna\" of 1839, now in the\r\nLouvre, he proved himself by no means an orthodox pupil. \"He has not the\r\nleast understanding for the ideas or the changes which have entered into\r\nart in our time, and knows absolutely nothing of the poets of recent\r\ndays. He will live on as a reminiscence and a reproduction of certain\r\nages in the art of the past, without having created anything to hand\r\ndown to the future. My wishes and my ideas do not in the least\r\ncorrespond with his.\" In these words Chassériau has himself pointed out\r\nwhat it was that distinguished him from Ingres. Unfortunately he\r\nproduced but little. Personally a very elegant, _blasé_ gentleman, he\r\nplunged on his return from Italy into the whirlpool of Parisian life. He\r\nwas remarkably ugly; but his black, piercing eyes made him the idol of\r\nthe ladies, and he hurried through life with such haste that he broke\r\ndown altogether at the age of thirty-six. Beyond various decorative\r\npaintings for the church of Saint Méry and for the Salle des Comptes in\r\nthe Palais d'Orsay, only a few Eastern pictures, and, best and most\r\ncharacteristic, a couple of lithographs, remain to represent his work.\r\nIn these delicate mythological compositions a chord is struck which\r\nfound no echo until, a generation later, it was heard again in the work\r\nof the French New Idealists and the English Pre-Raphaelites: there\r\nspeaks in them a Romantic Hellenism, a something dreamily mystic, which\r\nmakes him a remarkable link between Delacroix and the most refined\r\nspirit in the modern school, Gustave Moreau. It was purely an act of\r\ngratitude in Moreau when he affixed the dedication \"To Théodore\r\nChassériau\" to his fine picture of \"The Young Man and Death.\"\r\n\r\n_Léon Benouville_ will be remembered only for his picture of the \"Death\r\nof St. Francis,\" in the Louvre, a good piece of work in the manner of\r\nthe Quattrocento. _Léon Cogniet_ deserves to be mentioned because in the\r\nfifties he brought together in his studio so many foreign pupils,\r\nespecially Germans. He enjoyed above all others the reputation of being\r\nable to initiate beginners both quickly and with certainty into the\r\npeculiar mysteries of craftsmanship. All that a master can teach, and\r\nthat can be learned from his example, was to be obtained from this kind\r\nand fatherly instructor. Even after he had long given up painting, his\r\ngrateful pupils used to meet together yearly at a banquet given in the\r\npatriarch's honour. As an artist he belongs to the list of the great men\r\nwho have paid for overpraise in their lifetime by oblivion after their\r\ndeath. His \"Massacre of the Innocents\" of 1824--a woman who, mad with\r\nterror, thinks to hide herself and her child from the assassins of\r\nBethlehem under an open stairway--could give pleasure only in a time\r\nwhich hailed with enthusiasm Ary Scheffer's heads resembling plaster\r\nbusts full of expression. Occasionally, too, he painted landscapes--the\r\nchimerical, vague creations of a man who had lived but little in the\r\nopen air. His finest picture, \"Tintoretto Painting his Dead Daughter by\r\nLamplight,\" of 1843, the engravings of which once enraptured France and\r\nGermany, has to-day a somewhat insipid effect, and shows whither his\r\ngenius was leading him--in technique a coarser Schalcken, in sentiment a\r\nweaker Delaroche.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COGNIET.   TINTORETTO PAINTING HIS DEAD DAUGHTER.]\r\n\r\nDelaroche was the Titian of Louis Philippe's age, the spoiled child of\r\nthe Juste-milieu, one of the most insignificant and at the same time one\r\nof the most famous painters of the century; and in this double capacity\r\nis an interesting proof that in art the \"Vox populi\" is seldom the \"Vox\r\nDei.\" What a difference between him and the great spirits of the\r\nRomantic school! They were enthusiastic poets; their predilection for\r\nMediævalism was concerned only with its æsthetic charm, with the\r\ntwilight shadows of its picturesque churches, the sounding presage of\r\nits bells, the motley processions of that world gleaming bright with\r\nuninterrupted colour. And what further allured their imaginative powers\r\nwas the unruly character of certain epochs, the destructive war of wild\r\nfactions, and the blazing, consuming power of passion. The historical\r\nmotive, as such, was with them only a pretext for launching forth into\r\nflashing orgies of colour, according to the example, which they followed\r\nmerely in externals, of the Venetian and Flemish masters. They knew, as\r\ngenuine painters, that only in the pigment on their palette slumbers\r\nthat power of exciting emotion by means of which the art of painting\r\ntouches the chords of men's souls. Enthusiasts of colour and of passion,\r\nthey raved about the poets merely because the latter more readily\r\nenabled them, by means of the fierce vehemence of the awakened powers of\r\nnature, to invest with form the feverish, agitated, and terrible dreams\r\nof their fantasy. So it was that Delacroix told of conflagration, of\r\nbattle and warfare, of murder and pillage, of the bitterness and pains\r\nof love. At the same time, no doubt, he studied the vari-coloured\r\ncostumes of past ages--his drawings show as much--but he made use of\r\nthem simply as a storehouse of bright hues, as a lexicon by means of\r\nwhich he might embody his visions of colour. To manufacture historical\r\nvignettes and play the part of a teacher of history would have been in\r\nhis eyes a thing to be held in contempt as the work of subservient\r\nillustrators. Yet perhaps it was by taking this very course that far\r\ngreater successes were to be attained, so far as the verdict of the\r\nmultitude is considered.\r\n\r\nThe decade following upon 1820 was a season of brilliant blossom for the\r\nart of writing history in France. By his _History of the English\r\nRevolution_, in 1826, Guizot won for himself a place in the foremost\r\nrank of French authors. He began in 1829 his famous lectures at the\r\nSorbonne, and commenced in 1832 the publication of his _Sources of\r\nFrench History_. Even before him, Augustin Thierry had written in 1825\r\nhis _History of the Conquest of England by the Normans_, followed by\r\n_Stories from the Merovingian Times_, and was now engaged in the\r\npreparation of his great work, the _History of the Origin and Progress\r\nof the Third Estate_. Not unworthy to be compared with these writers,\r\nand soon to stand beside them, were two young men working in\r\ncollaboration--Mignet and Thiers--who came to the front in 1823-24 with\r\ntheir _History of the Revolution_. At the impulse thus given, historical\r\nsocieties and unions had arisen in every province of France, and were\r\ndeveloping an ever-increasing activity.\r\n\r\nWhat learning had begun, poetry carried further. A number of writers,\r\nyoung and old, began to consider what poetic use might be made of the\r\nmaterials which these investigations had brought to light, and few years\r\nhad passed before the number of historical romances and dramas was\r\nhardly to be computed. Vitet, the elder Dumas, and de Vigny put\r\nhistorical tragedy in the place of classical, and the modern novel of\r\nGeorge Sand, Balzac, and Beyle was ousted by the historical romance.\r\nDuring the same years was completed the process by which grand opera\r\nforsook fantastic for historical subjects, such as Auber's _Muette de\r\nPortici_ and Rossini's _Guillaume Tell_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COGNIET.   THE MASSACRE OF THE INNOCENTS.]\r\n\r\nArt also sought to turn to account the new materials furnished by\r\nhistorical science, and æsthetic minds hastened to enumerate the\r\nadvantages which were to be expected of it. On the one hand--and this\r\nwas nothing new--the artist, whose curse it was to be born in an\r\ninactive and colourless age, would find here all that he sought, for\r\nhistory offered him the contemplation of a magnificent life, full of\r\nmovement. On the other hand--and this was the chief point--painting\r\nmight also fulfil an important mission on behalf of culture, if by\r\nvirtue of its more easily understood method it could supplement the\r\nscience of history, and by recalling the great memories of the past keep\r\nalive that patriotism which in unfavourable conjunctures is so\r\nfrequently found wanting. Guizot recommended French history, \"the\r\nhistory of chivalry,\" to painters, as the first and most important\r\nsource of inspiration. \"We want historians in the art of painting,\"\r\nwrote Vitet; and his cry was not unheard.\r\n\r\nWhile the Romanticists had seen in the old costumes nothing more than\r\nelements out of which a dashing colour-symphony could be obtained,\r\ntroubling themselves little about the meaning or the narrative import of\r\ntheir pictures, their successors went over, bag and baggage, into the\r\ncamp of the historians. In the place of pure painting, there arose an\r\nart laden with scientific documents, which busied itself in\r\nreconstructing former times with antiquarian exactness. While the former\r\nhad produced nought but genuinely artistic colour-improvisations, so now\r\na didactic aim, together with historical accuracy, became the main\r\nconsideration. The painter was commissioned as a chronicler, an official\r\nof the state, to console citizens for the lamentable present by an\r\nappeal to the glorious past. He became a professor of history, a\r\ntheatrical costumier who rummaged records, chose masks, cut out dresses,\r\narranged scenic backgrounds, for no other purpose than to depict\r\ncorrectly and legibly on the canvas an historical event. And Mme. Tout\r\nle Monde found in these pictures exactly what she required. On the one\r\nhand, the didactic aim of historical painting, with its long\r\nexplanations in the catalogues, answered precisely to the needs of the\r\neducated middle classes. Under the picture there was always a pretty\r\ncard on which was printed this or that quotation from some historical\r\nwriter. One read the description, and then satisfied one's self that\r\nthe corresponding picture was really there and that it was in keeping\r\nwith the description. One recalled to mind the lessons in history one\r\nhad learned at school, and was pleased to be reminded in so pleasant a\r\nfashion that before the nineteenth century people did not wear trousers\r\nand frock-coats, but knitted hose and mantles. On the other hand, there\r\nstill survived enough of the Romantic unruliness to allow one to be\r\nshocked in a decorous and moderate manner, and with the help of the\r\ncatalogue a picture might be permitted to make one's flesh creep in an\r\nagreeable way.\r\n\r\nFor the average painter of mediocre ability historical exercises of this\r\nsort must also have been very alluring, inasmuch as they made no demand\r\nupon specially artistic qualities--upon any peculiar aptitude of the\r\nfancy, eye, or palette. The historian must indeed possess the power of\r\ncombination, but much more that of sober investigation; too much\r\nimagination or too great a sense of humour would be dangerous to him. So\r\nalso the historical painter required neither fancy, sentiment, nor power\r\nof perception; a certain capacity for compiling facts was all that was\r\nnecessary. It was enough to ferret out of some popular book on history\r\nthe story of a murder, and to possess a work upon costumes. By such\r\nmeans, men of a certain ability could easily manage, with the help of\r\nthe studio technique founded by the Romantic school, to put together the\r\nmost imposing show-pieces. And even the critics allowed themselves\r\nfrequently to be so far misled as to give to those models who were\r\ndecked out in the finest costumes, and labelled with the names of the\r\nmost celebrated personages, precedence over their more modest\r\ncompanions. Consequently it happened that in the time of the citizen\r\nmonarchy a great number of painters entirely devoid of talent, whose\r\nonly merit was that they attached to this or that chapter of universal\r\nhistory pictures showing some laboured animation, became in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye leaders of the schools.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAUL DELAROCHE.   _L'Art._\r\n\r\n  \"Paul Delaroche à la funèbre mine\r\n    S'entour avec plaisir de cadavres et d'os\r\n  Jane Grey, Mazarin, héros et héroine\r\n    Chez lui tout meurt ... excepté ces tableaux.\"]\r\n\r\n_Eugène Devéria_ was the first and most important painter deliberately\r\nto enter upon this course. When his picture of the \"Birth of Henry IV\"\r\nwas exhibited in the Salon of 1827 his appearance was welcomed as that\r\nof a new Veronese, and his work joyfully saluted as the first historical\r\npicture in which the local colour of the epoch represented was\r\naccurately observed. Henceforth Devéria dressed always in the style of\r\nRubens, and his house became the headquarters of the Romantic school. He\r\nwas perhaps the only member of this group in whom some breath of\r\nDelacroix's spirit survived, but unfortunately he never found again\r\neither the Venetian tone or the male accent of his youth, and though he\r\npainted many more pictures he never contributed a second notable work to\r\nart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  DELAROCHE.   THE ASSASSINATION OF THE DUKE OF GUISE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L'Art._\r\n\r\n  DELAROCHE.   THE PRINCES IN THE TOWER.]\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards _Camille Roqueplan_ began to alter his manner. Up to\r\nthat time he had been exclusively a painter who, like Watteau and\r\nTerborg, listened with a voluptuous shudder to the piquant rustle of\r\nsilk, velvet, and satin dresses; now he devoted himself to depicting\r\nwith perspicuity various scenes from history, renounced his airy and\r\nradiant fantasies, and became, in his \"Scene from the Massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew,\" nothing but a tedious schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n_Nicolaus Robert Fleury_, the painter of \"Charles V in the Monastery of\r\nSt. Just,\" of the \"Massacre of St. Bartholomew,\" of the \"Religious\r\nConference at Poissy,\" and of other historical anecdotes, carefully\r\nconceived and laboriously executed, devoted himself, like Lessing, to\r\nthe propagation of noble ideas. His pictures were manifestoes against\r\nreligious fanaticism, and philanthropic discussions concerning the\r\ntrials and persecutions of the freethinkers. In order to give them the\r\nstamp of historical verisimilitude, he buried himself with the zeal of\r\nan archivist in the study of the period to be represented; often\r\ndirectly transferred into his pictures figures from Diepenbeeck or\r\nTheodor van Thulden; and having the faculty of seizing in old paintings\r\nthose tones of colour which belong rather to the epoch than the master,\r\nhe succeeded in giving his works a certain documentary and archaic\r\ncharacter for which, on his first appearance, he obtained ample credit.\r\n\r\n_Louis Boulanger_, after his \"Mazeppa\" of 1827, was a famous painter.\r\nBut the highest success was that attained by Paul Delaroche, inasmuch as\r\nhe understood better than any other, not only how to cater for the\r\ncultured public by the didactic nature and historical accuracy of his\r\npictures, but also how to touch the heart by means of a lachrymose\r\nsentimentality.\r\n\r\n_Paul Delaroche_ belongs, by the date of his birth, to the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Being one of Gros' pupils, he had never borne the yoke of the\r\nClassical school in its fullest weight, and therefore had never had\r\noccasion to revolt against it. When the Romanticists came to the front,\r\nhe had gone or rather been dragged along with them, for to his\r\ncircumspect nature Romanticism was an abomination, and his cool and\r\ndeliberative spirit felt itself much more at home in the society of the\r\nClassicists. The works of the historians opened to him a welcome outlet\r\nby which to avoid a rupture with either party, and Delaroche found his\r\nvocation. He assumed the rôle of a peacemaker between the quarrelling\r\nbrothers, placed himself as mediator between Montagues and Capulets, and\r\nthus became--like Casimir Delavigne in literature--the head of that\r\n\"School of Common Sense\" on whose banner glittered in golden letters\r\nLouis Philippe's motto of the Juste-milieu. Ingres was cold, reserved,\r\nand colourless; Delaroche aspired to an agreeable, sparkling, highly\r\nseasoned, bituminous art of painting. Delacroix was genial and sketchy;\r\nDelaroche inscribed carefulness and exactness on his banner. The former\r\nhad given offence by his boldness; Delaroche won the conservatives over\r\nto himself by his well-bred bearing and moderate attitude. People\r\nthought Delacroix too wild and poetical; Delaroche took care to give\r\nthem only a touch of the eagerness of Romanticism, and set himself to\r\nreduce the passionate vehemence of Delacroix to rational, Philistine\r\nlimits, and to soften down his native unruliness into sentimental\r\npathos. This position which he assumed as a mediator made him the man of\r\nhis age. The life of Delacroix was a long struggle. But for the\r\ncommissions entrusted to him by the state he might have died of\r\nstarvation, for his sales to dealers and lovers of art brought him\r\nscarcely five hundred francs a year. His studio held many pictures,\r\nleaning mournfully against each other in corners. Delaroche, on the\r\nother hand, was overwhelmed with praise and commissions. The\r\nrepresentatives of eclecticism in philosophy and of the Juste-milieu in\r\npolitics found themselves compelled to praise an artist who was neither\r\nrevolutionary nor reactionist, neither Romantic nor Classical, who had\r\nbound himself over neither to draughtsmanship nor to colouring, but\r\nunited both elements in vulgar moderation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  DELAROCHE.   STRAFFORD ON HIS WAY TO EXECUTION.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS COUTURE.   _L'Art._]\r\n\r\nAlready in his first notable works, in 1831, \"The Princes in the Tower\"\r\nand \"Oliver Cromwell,\" he has fully assumed his lukewarm manner. He\r\nmight have represented the murder of the princes, but fearing that the\r\npublic would not stand it, he preferred merely to suggest the\r\napproaching death of the weeping and terrified children by placing in\r\nfront of the bed a small dog, which is looking uneasily towards the\r\ndoor, where the red light of torches indicates the approach of the\r\nassassins,--a Düsseldorf picture with improved technique. It is just the\r\nsame with his melodramatic and lachrymose \"Cromwell.\" It would be hardly\r\npossible to represent one of the greatest figures in universal history\r\nin a more paltry manner, and to this day it is not quite certain whether\r\nthe picture was intended to be serious or humorous. The great statesman\r\nin whom was embodied the political and ecclesiastical revolution of\r\nEngland must have been extremely busy on the day of Charles I's funeral,\r\nand have had better things to do than stealthily to open the coffin and\r\ncontemplate, with a mixture of childish curiosity and sentimental pity,\r\nthe corpse of the king whom he had fought and conquered. Eugène\r\nDelacroix had treated this subject in a sketch, in which Cromwell, at\r\nthe funeral of Charles, gazes in quiet contempt upon the weak monarch\r\nwho had not known how to keep either his crown or his head. As a work of\r\nart this little water-colour is worth ten times as much as Delaroche's\r\ngreat, long-meditated, carefully executed painting. From the very\r\nbeginning he had no sense for the passionate or dramatic. From the first\r\nday, had the tailor who prepared costumes struck work, his artistic\r\ngreatness would have fallen away to nothing; from the commencement he\r\nproduced nothing but large, clumsily conceived illustrations for\r\nhistorical novels. Planché pointed out long ago that all the costumes\r\nare glaringly new, that all the victims look as if they had got\r\nthemselves up for a masked ball, that this sort of painting is much too\r\nclean and pretty to give the argument the appearance of probability.\r\nThéophile Gautier, who had proclaimed the powerful originality of\r\nDelacroix, fumed with rage against these \"saliva-polished\r\nrepresentations, this art for the half-educated, disguised in false,\r\nPhilistine realism, this art of historical illustration for the familiar\r\nuse of the _bourgeois_.\" To rank timorous, half-hearted talent higher\r\nthan reckless and awe-inspiring genius--this was in Gautier's eyes the\r\nsin against the Holy Ghost, and he sprang like a tiger upon the\r\npopularity of talents such as these. He could, as he himself said, have\r\nswallowed Delaroche, skin, hair, and all, without remorse; meanwhile,\r\nthe public raised him upon the shield as its declared favourite.\r\n\r\nHe won the intellectual middle class over to himself with a rush, as he\r\nindustriously went on rummaging in manuals of French and English history\r\nfor royal murders and battle-deaths of kings. With his \"Richelieu,\"\r\n\"Mazarin,\" and \"Strafford,\" but especially with his \"Execution of Lady\r\nJane Grey\" and \"Murder of the Duke of Guise in the Castle of Blois,\" he\r\nmade hits such as no other French artist of his time could put to his\r\naccount. Just then, in his youthful work, _The States-General at Blois_,\r\nLudovic Vitet had put the murder of the Duke of Guise upon the stage.\r\nNothing could be better-timed than to transform this operatic scene into\r\ncolour. The historians of civilisation admired the historical accuracy\r\nof the courtiers' dress, all the upholstery of the room, the lofty\r\nmantelpiece, the carved wardrobes, the praying-stool with the\r\naltar-piece over it, the canopy-bed with its curtains of red silk\r\nembroidered with lilies and the king's initials in gold. Playgoers\r\ncompared the scene with that which they had witnessed on the stage in\r\nVitet's piece, and the comparison was not unfavourable to the painter.\r\nFor Delaroche, in order to be as far as possible in keeping with the\r\nstage representation, was accustomed to commission Jollivet, the chief\r\nmechanician of the Opera House, to prepare for him small models of\r\nrooms, in which he then arranged his lay-figures.\r\n\r\nThat is the further great difference between Delaroche and Delacroix,\r\nbetween the vagrant painter of history and the artist. The latter had\r\nthe gift of the inner vision, and only painted things which had\r\nintellectually laid hold upon him and had assumed firm shape in his\r\nimagination. It was while the organ was playing the _Dies iræ_ that he\r\nsaw his \"Pietà\" in a vision--that mighty work which in power of\r\nexpression almost approaches Rembrandt. \"Is not Tasso's life most\r\ninteresting?\" he writes. \"You weep for him, swaying restlessly from side\r\nto side on your chair, when you read the story of his life; your eyes\r\nassume a threatening aspect, and you grind your teeth with rage.\" Such\r\npassionate emotion was wholly unknown to Delaroche; he painted deeds of\r\nmurder with the wildness of Mieris. Delacroix everywhere grasps what is\r\nessential, and gives to every scene its poetical or religious character.\r\nA couple of lines are for him sufficient means wherewith to produce a\r\ndeep impression. In presence of his pictures one does not think of\r\ncostumes; one sees everywhere passion overflowing with love and anger,\r\nand is intoxicated with the harmony of sentiment and colour. Delaroche,\r\nlike Thierry, had merely a predilection for the historical anecdote\r\nwhich, dramatically pointed, keeps the beholder in suspense, or else,\r\nsimply narrated, amuses him. The colour and spirit of events had no\r\npower over his imagination; he merely apprehended them with a cool\r\nunderstanding, and put them laboriously together in keeping with it.\r\nDelacroix sought counsel from nature; but in the moment of creation, in\r\nfront of the canvas, he could not bear direct contact with it. \"The\r\ninfluence of the model,\" he wrote, \"lowers the painter's tone; a stupid\r\nfellow makes you stupid.\" Delaroche draped his models as was required,\r\nmade them posture and pull faces, and while he was painting, laboriously\r\nscrewed them up to the pathos demanded by the situation. Such a method\r\nof procedure must necessarily become theatrical.\r\n\r\nJust as in his historical pictures he endeavoured to transform\r\nDelacroix's passion into operatic scenes, so he perfected his position\r\nas a man of compromise by imitating the academic style in his\r\n\"Hemicycle.\" Here it was Ingres' laurels which robbed him of his sleep.\r\nThe fame which this picture has acquired is mainly due to Henriquel\r\nDupont's fine engraving. It does not attain to any kind of solemn or\r\nserious effect. One might imagine one's self in some entirely prosaic\r\nwaiting-room, where all the great men of every age have agreed to meet\r\ntogether for no matter what ceremonial purpose; one sees there a\r\ncarefully chosen collection of costumes of all epochs, with well-studied\r\nbut expressionless portraits of the leaders of civilisation. Here also\r\nDelaroche has not risen above respectable mediocrity, and his\r\ncharacteristics remain, as ever, thoroughly middle-class.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUTURE.   THE LOVE OF GOLD.]\r\n\r\nHis likeness of Napoleon is perhaps that which shows most clearly how\r\npaltry a soul this painter possessed. It is not Devastation in human\r\nshape, not the man in whom his officers saw the \"God of War\" and of whom\r\nMme. de Staël said, \"There is nothing human left in him.\" The intellect\r\nof that Corsican, with his great thoughts striding as in seven-leagued\r\nboots, thoughts each of which would give any single German writer\r\nmaterial for the rest of his life, was hidden to the inquisitive glance\r\nof a painter who had never seen in the whole of human history anything\r\nmore than a series of petty episodes. And one who is not able to paint a\r\ngood portrait is not justified in intruding into other regions of art.\r\n\r\nFor similar reasons the religious paintings with which he busied himself\r\nin his last days have likewise enriched art with no new element. They\r\nare a Philistine remodelling of the Biblical drama, in the same style as\r\nhis historical pictures. In the end he appears himself to have become\r\nconscious how little laborious compilations of this kind have in common\r\nwith art, and since with the best will in the world he could produce\r\nnothing better than he had painted in the thirties, he lost all pleasure\r\nin his vocation and abandoned himself to gloom and pessimism, from which\r\ndeath set him free in 1856.\r\n\r\n_Thomas Couture_, who after Delaroche was most in vogue as a teacher in\r\nthe fifties, was of greater importance as an artist, and in his \"Romans\r\nof the Decadence\" produced a work which, from the point of view of the\r\nJuste-milieu, is worthy of consideration even to-day. He was a\r\nremarkable man. His parents, shoemakers at Senlis, seem to have regarded\r\nthe thick-headed, slowly developing boy as a kind of idiot, and are said\r\nto have treated him with no excessive gentleness. He was sent away from\r\nschool because he could not understand the simplest things, and studied\r\nwithout success in the studios of Gros and Delaroche. And yet, after he\r\nhad made his début in the Salon of 1843 with the \"Troubadour,\" a fine\r\npicture in the style of Devéria, his \"Orgie Romaine\" of 1847 made him at\r\none stroke the most celebrated painter in France. Pupils thronged to him\r\nfrom every quarter of the globe, and he left a deep and enduring\r\nimpression upon every one of them. A very short, corpulent,\r\nbroad-shouldered, thick-set, proletarian figure, with thick disorderly\r\nhair, a blouse, a short pipe, and a gruff manner, he used to stride\r\nthrough the lines of his pupils, who regarded him with wonder on account\r\nof his ability as a teacher and his remarkable powers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  COUTURE.   THE ROMANS OF THE DECADENCE.]\r\n\r\nYet, when a few years had elapsed, no one heard of him again. After his\r\n\"Love of Gold\" and a couple of portraits, he felt that he was\r\nunfruitful, and gave up the battle. \"The Falconer,\" an excellent\r\npicture, with charming qualities of colour, was the last work to give\r\nany proof of Couture's technical mastery. He fell out with Napoleon, who\r\nwished to employ him; made many enemies by his writings, especially\r\namong the followers of Delacroix, whom he criticised beyond measure; and\r\nfinally, embittered, and abandoning all artistic work, he buried himself\r\nin his country place at Villers de Bel, near Paris. Thither Americans\r\nand Englishmen used to come to order pictures of him, and were much\r\nastonished to hear that the old gardener's assistant, as they took him\r\nto be, sitting on the grass and mending shoes or old kettles, was\r\nCouture. The news of his death in 1879 caused general astonishment; it\r\nwas as if one long buried had come to life again. It had meanwhile\r\nbecome evident that even his \"Romans of the Decadence\" was only a work\r\nof compromise, the whole novelty of which consisted in forcing the\r\nresults attained by the Romantic school in colouring into that bed of\r\nProcrustes, the formulæ of idealism. The work is undoubtedly very\r\nnoble in colouring, but what would not Delacroix have made of such a\r\ntheme! or Rubens, indeed, whose Flemish \"Kermesse\" hangs not far from it\r\nin the Louvre. Couture's figures have only \"absolute beauty,\" nothing\r\nindividual; far less do they exhibit the unnerved sensuality of Romans\r\nof the decline engaged in their orgies. They are merely posing, and find\r\ntheir classical postures wearisome. They are not revelling, they do not\r\nlove; they are only busied in filling up the space so as to produce an\r\nagreeable effect, and in disposing themselves in picturesque groups.\r\nEven the faces have been vulgarised by idealism: everything is as noble\r\nas it is without character. There is something of the hermaphrodite in\r\nCouture's work. His art was male in its subjects, female in its results.\r\nHis \"Decadence\" was the work of a decadent, a decadent of Classicism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  COUTURE.   THE TROUBADOUR.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Charles Sedelmeyer, the owner of the picture._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE POST-ROMANTIC GENERATION\r\n\r\n\r\nFour years after Couture painted his \"Roman Orgy,\" Napoleon III ascended\r\nthe throne, and the Parisian orgy began. It was a remarkable spectacle\r\nthat the capital offered in those days--a spectacle of fairy-like,\r\nflashing and sparkling splendour. Even to-day, when Republican Paris\r\nendeavours as much as possible to obliterate every memory of the Empire,\r\nNapoleon's spirit lives in the external appearance of the city and\r\nhovers over every conspicuous point. Augustus might say that he had\r\nfound his capital a city of plaster and lime, and left it one of stone\r\nand bronze; Napoleon has the right to maintain that he raised palaces\r\nwhere there had been barracks.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the imprecations uttered against his rule, the most\r\nthorough-going Republicans reluctantly concede to him the possession of\r\none good quality: he knew how to bring prosperity to the shop; \"_il\r\nfaisait marcher le commerce_.\" One hears it said that the beautiful city\r\non the Seine is but the shadow of what it then was. \"_Le niveau a\r\nbaissé!_\" says the Parisian, when he calls to mind the gorgeous days of\r\nthe Empire. The extravagant elegance, the magnificent luxury, which used\r\nto roll in superb carriages along the Boulevards and the Champs Elysées\r\ntowards the Bois de Boulogne, and exhibited itself in the evening in the\r\nboxes of the theatres; the lustre which emanated from the Court, and the\r\nconcourse of all the nabobs of the world,--all this must in those days\r\nhave given to Parisian life a sparkling splendour, a something\r\nstupefying and intoxicating, an alacrity of enjoyment which had no\r\nparallel elsewhere. To the respectable, pedantic _bourgeoisie_ which\r\nruled under Louis Philippe had succeeded a new generation of men of the\r\nworld, which drank to the lees all the refined pleasures that a modern\r\ngreat city has to offer. The gentlefolk of the Empire understood the art\r\nof living better, cultivated and exhausted it after a more inventive\r\nfashion, than any generation that had gone before. In the Tuileries sat\r\nthe man of the Second of December, the connoisseur and promoter of all\r\nrefined tastes. In his person the age was embodied, that age depicted by\r\nZola in _La Curée_, in the passage where he describes the halls,\r\nillumined as if by enchantment, of the imperial palace. There, all the\r\nsplendour of over-civilisation glitters and gleams, with its bright eyes\r\nand sparkling jewels, with its breath of intoxicating perfumes floating\r\nfrom naked shoulders and arms and half-veiled voluptuous bosoms; while\r\nthe green, sphinx-like eye of Napoleon III rests indifferently on the\r\nalabaster sea of white shoulders bowing before him, as he reviews all\r\nthat he has possessed and all that he can yet enjoy. Dumas' _Dame aux\r\nCamélias_, _Diane de Lys_ and _Le Demi-monde_, Barrière's _Filles de\r\nMarbre_, Augier's _Mariage d'Olympe_, give the impress of the period\r\nupon literature, and the single phrase \"The Lady of the Camelias\"\r\nconjures up a world of forms and of scenery. _La Nouvelle Babylone_ is\r\nthe title of the fine book in which Joseph Pelletan depicted the\r\nmysterious Paris of those years, the great city which cherished in its\r\nbosom the lowest and highest extremes of a refined world of pleasure,\r\nand was at the same time an inexhaustible fountain of arduous work.\r\n\r\nOne would have imagined that these new conditions of Imperial France\r\nwould have left their impress, in some way or other, upon the art of\r\npainting also; just as in the works of Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Jan Steen,\r\nTerborg, Ostade, Pieter de Hooch, and Van der Meer of Delft the entire\r\nseventeenth century is reflected, clearly and with animation, treated\r\nwith charming familiarity or else with grandiose effect, in its spirit,\r\nits manner of feeling, its habits and costumes. What a domain painting\r\nwould have had; from the official festivals and the bustle of public\r\nlife down to the complete delineation of the family home! Literature had\r\nentered into this course a quarter of a century before, and had shown\r\nthe path--a path leading to new worlds. But in French art French society\r\nis not reflected. Not a single painter has left us a picture of this\r\nsplendid Paris, dancing on a volcano and yet so amiably delightful.\r\nClassicism and historical painting still held the field, as if turned to\r\nstone, and show, in essentials, hardly any modification.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  ALEXANDRE CABANEL.]\r\n\r\nSo far back as in 1833, Charles Lenormant wrote of the school of David:\r\n\"Even the great painter Ingres was not able to rejuvenate a school which\r\nwas breaking up from old age, or to restore their full resonance to the\r\nslackened and worn-out chords; his only office was to give the old\r\nsynagogue honourable burial. Take away this last scion of the Classical\r\nschool, and the curtain may fall--the farce is ended.\" He might have\r\nsaid the same thing forty years later, for with Cabanel and Bouguereau\r\nClassicism has limped on, almost unchanged, to our own days. Its art was\r\na correct, conventional picture-stencilling, which might just as well\r\nhave flourished a generation earlier. Classicism--which in David was\r\nhard and Spartan, in Ingres cold and correct--has become pretty in\r\nCabanel and Bouguereau, and is completely dissolved in the scent of\r\nroses and violets. Only a certain perfume of the _demi-monde_ brings the\r\npersons who appear as Venus, as naiads, as Aurora or Diana, into\r\ncomplete accord with the epoch which produced them. For Ingres the\r\nfemale body itself was the exclusive canon of beautiful form; now the\r\nswelling limbs begin to stretch themselves voluptuously forth. Ingres\r\nstill treats the human eye as it was treated in ancient sculpture, as\r\nsomething animal, soulless, and dead; now it begins to twinkle\r\nprovocatively. A modern refined taste plays round the classical scheme.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  CABANEL.   THE SHULAMITE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOUGUEREAU.   BROTHERLY LOVE.]\r\n\r\n_Alexandre Cabanel_, the incarnation of the academician, was, under\r\nNapoleon III, the head of the École des Beaux Arts. He was a fortunate\r\nman. Born at Montpellier, the city of professors, nourished from his\r\nearliest youth on academic milk, winner of the Grand Prix de Rome in\r\n1845, awarded the first medal at the Universal Exhibition of 1855, he\r\nwent on his way, laden with orders and offices, amid the tumultuous\r\napplause of the public. Among the artists of the nineteenth century none\r\nattained in so high a degree all those honours which lie open to a\r\npainter in our days. Yet, as an artist, he remained all his life on the\r\nplane of the school of Ingres. Even his \"Death of Moses,\" the first\r\npicture which he sent from Rome to the Salon, was entirely pieced\r\ntogether out of Raphael and Michael Angelo. After that he laid himself\r\nout to provide England and America with those women, more or less fully\r\nattired, who bore sometimes biblical, sometimes literary names: Delilah,\r\nthe Shulamite woman, Jephthah's daughter, Ruth, Tamar, Flora, Echo,\r\nPsyche, Hero, Lucretia, Cleopatra, Penelope, Phædra, Desdemona,\r\nFiammetta, Francesca da Rimini, Pia dei Tolomei--an endless procession.\r\nBut the only variety in this poetical seraglio lay in the inscriptions\r\non the labels; the way in which the figures were represented was always\r\nthe same. His works are pictures blamelessly drawn, moderately well\r\npainted, which leave one cold and untouched at heart. They possess that\r\nunusual polish and that dexterity of exposition which, like good manners\r\nin society, create a favourable impression, but are insufficient in\r\nthemselves to make a man a pleasant companion. Nowhere is there anything\r\nthat takes hold upon the soul, nowhere any touch to prove that the\r\nartist has felt anything in his painting, or force the beholder to feel\r\nfor himself. The unvarying faces of his figures, with their eternal\r\ndark-rimmed eyes, resemble not living human beings but painted plaster\r\ncasts. One would take his \"Cleopatra,\" apathetically observing the\r\noperation of the poison, to be stuffed, like the panther at her feet.\r\nOne seeks in vain for a figure that is sincere or interesting, for a\r\nface alluring in its truth to nature. His \"Venus\" of 1862 made him the\r\nfavourite painter of the Tuileries, and the insipid, rosy tints of that\r\npicture became more and more feeble in the course of years, until his\r\nworks resembled wearisome cartoons, coloured by no matter what process.\r\nHe was Picot's pupil, it is true, but in reality Ingres was his\r\ngrandfather, a grandfather far, far greater than himself, whose\r\nportraits alone show the entire littleness of Cabanel. All his life long\r\nIngres was in his portraits a fresh, animated, and admirable realist.\r\nCabanel indeed also painted in his earliest days likenesses of ladies\r\nwhich were full of serious grace, uniting a powerful fidelity to nature\r\nwith considerable elegance. But his success was fatal to him. Moreover,\r\nas a portrait-painter, he became the depicter of society, and society\r\nruined him. In order to please his distinguished customers, he devoted\r\nhimself far more than is good for portrait-painting to smooth rosy\r\nflesh, large glassy eyes, and dainty fine hands, and over-idealised his\r\nsitters till they lost every appearance of life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEFÉBURE.   TRUTH.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Messrs. Goupil, the owners of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\n_William Bouguereau_, who industriously learnt all that can be\r\nassimilated by a man destitute of artistic feeling but possessing a\r\ncultured taste, reveals even more clearly, in his feeble mawkishness,\r\nthe fatal decline of the old schools of convention. He has been compared\r\nto Octave Feuillet, who also never extricated himself from the scented\r\natmosphere of distinguished society; but the comparison is unjust to\r\nFeuillet. Bouguereau is in his Madonna-painting a perfumed Ary Scheffer,\r\nin his Venus-pictures a greater Hamon; and in his perfectly finished and\r\nfaultless stencilling style of beauty he became from year to year more\r\nand more insupportable. His art is a kind of painting on porcelain on a\r\nlarge scale, and he gives to his Madonnas and his nymphs the same smooth\r\nrosy tints, the same unreal universalised forms, until at last they\r\nbecome a _juste-milieu_ between Raphael's \"Galatea\" and the wax models\r\none sees in hairdressers' shops. Only in one sense can his religious\r\npainting be called modern; it is an elegant lie, like the whole of the\r\nSecond Empire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L'Art._\r\n\r\n  HENNER.   SUSANNA AND THE ELDERS.]\r\n\r\nClose by Bouguereau's \"Venus\" in the Luxembourg hangs the well-known\r\ncolossal figure of a beautiful nude woman with unnaturally\r\nover-developed thighs, which by the shining mirror in its uplifted right\r\nhand proclaims itself to be \"Truth.\" _Jules Lefébure_, the painter of\r\nthis picture, is also completely a slave to tradition; he came from\r\nCogniet's studio, and won the Prix de Rome in 1861. But he at least\r\npossesses more taste, elegance, and character; his painting of the nude\r\nis more distinguished, truer, and more powerful. He is in the broader\r\nsense of the word a worshipper of nature, and was so in his youth\r\nespecially. His \"Sleeping Girl\" of 1865 and his \"Femme couchée\" of 1868\r\nare smooth and honest studies from the nude, of delicate, sure\r\ndraughtsmanship, and have therefore not become antiquated even to-day.\r\nUnfortunately he did not find this masculine accent again, when at a\r\nlater time he grouped ideal figures together to make pictures of them.\r\nHis \"Diana surprised\" of 1879 was a very clever composition of\r\nwell-ordered lines, possessing even fine details, especially one or two\r\ncharming heads, but as a whole it is lifeless and uninteresting. Like\r\nBouguereau, he lacks power, and, notwithstanding his distinction and his\r\ncapacity for arrangement, he is not painter enough to be truthfully\r\nentitled a \"painter of the nude.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  HENNER.   THE SLEEPER.]\r\n\r\nIn general, French art, however willingly it took to this sphere during\r\nthe period we are considering, is rich indeed in well-drawn documents,\r\nbut poor in works which, considered as painting, can bear the most\r\ndistant comparison with Fragonard and Boucher. The Revolution had put an\r\nend to the joyous flesh-painting of French art. At the close of the\r\neighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century the painter of\r\ntender and life-like flesh-colour was not the reformer David, but the\r\ndespised Prudhon. The former found his ideal in statues, and turned\r\nflesh to stone. The latter, a direct descendant of Correggio, gave\r\nexpression to life with a tender mellowness. Ingres was again, like\r\nDavid, a very mediocre flesh-painter, and the Romanticists entered this\r\nsphere but seldom. Delacroix indeed has in his \"Massacre\" a couple of\r\nexcellent touches, but they are isolated phenomena in his work. After\r\n1850 the approved system was to give nude female figures the appearance\r\nof being made of terra-cotta, biscuit, or ivory. The forgotten art of\r\npainting velvety, soft flesh, and of making it vibrate in light, had to\r\nbe learned over again, and to this meritorious task _Henner_ devoted\r\nhimself--the modern Correggio from Alsace, who stands to Cabanel in the\r\nsame relation as Prudhon to David. Even Henner in his later days has\r\nbecome very much a mannerist, and has done some very bad work. To-day he\r\nprefers a heavy, pasty, buttery style of painting, with faces which look\r\nas if they had been pickled in oil, and have an unreal expression; his\r\ncontrasts of light and shade, once so delicate, have become raw and\r\nforced. Yet beside Cabanel he still appears the true poet of female\r\nflesh-painting, the dreamy graceful depicter of refined sensuality.\r\nPrudhon's delicate ideal and his language of vibrating tenderness are\r\nrevived in Henner. His \"Nymph resting\" in the Luxembourg has the same\r\nsoft _morbidezza_, the same delightful mystery, in which Prudhon before\r\nhim had enveloped the sweetness of smiling faces and the beauty of\r\nfemale forms. He too chose the Lombards as his guides. After winning the\r\nPrix de Rome in 1858, he sent to the Salon of 1865 a \"Susanna,\" which\r\nalready shows his ability as a flesh-painter and his relationship to\r\nCorreggio. And a Lombard he has remained all his life. One could with\r\ndifficulty find a more delicate and smooth study of the nude than his\r\n\"Biblis\" of 1867.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAUL BAUDRY.]\r\n\r\nSince that time another tendency highly characteristic of Henner has\r\nshown itself in his work. In his endeavour to render the tint and tender\r\nsoftness of flesh as delicately as possible, he sought at the same time\r\nfor light which should intensify the clear tone of the nude body. These\r\nhe found in that time of evening, which one might call Henner's hour,\r\nwhen the landscape, overshadowed by the twilight, gradually loses\r\ncolour, and only a small blue space in the sky or a silent forest-lake\r\nstill for a moment preserves the reflection of vanishing daylight. In\r\nthis tranquil harmony of nature after sunset, the white pallor of the\r\nhuman body seems to have absorbed all the daylight and to be giving it\r\nforth again, while the surrounding landscape is already merging into\r\ncolourless shadow. This is Henner's \"second manner,\" and he raised it\r\ninto a system. Every year since then there has appeared in the Salon one\r\nof those pale nymphs, standing out so mistily against the dark green of\r\nan evening landscape, or one of those Virgilian eclogues, in which the\r\ngloaming rests caressingly upon nude white bodies. And by this method of\r\npainting flesh and of throwing light upon it, Henner has won for himself\r\nan important place in modern art.\r\n\r\n_Paul Baudry_, the powerful decorator of the Grand Opera House at Paris,\r\nmarks the close of this tendency. In his work the endeavours of all\r\nthose talented artists who sought to found a new school of \"ideal\r\npainting\" upon the basis of the study of the Italian Classicists came to\r\na crowning height; and at the same time Baudry took a further step\r\nonward, in that he vivified the classical scheme with a yet more marked\r\ncast of \"modernity.\"\r\n\r\nHis first picture, on the murder of Marat, was feeble. What David had\r\nexecuted smoothly and forcibly in his dead \"Marat,\" Baudry spoiled in\r\nhis \"Charlotte Corday.\" The bath, the night-table with the inkstand on\r\nit, the map on the wall, and all the fittings of the room, are painted\r\nwith the greatest finish, but the young heroine in her petrified\r\nidealism has no more life in her than there is in the furniture.\r\n\r\nHis \"Pearl and Wave,\" which is hung in the Luxembourg close to Cabanel's\r\nand Bouguereau's \"Birth of Venus,\" gave proof of progress. A deep-blue\r\nwave, towering on high and crowned with foam, has washed a charming\r\nwoman ashore like a costly pearl. She seems to have just awakened out of\r\nslumber, and her roguish, moistly gleaming eyes are smiling. Saucily she\r\nleans forward her fair-haired head under her bended arms, and stretches\r\nout in easy motion her youthfully slender yet fully proportioned body.\r\nBouguereau's and even Cabanel's female beauties are waxen and spoiled by\r\nretouching, but Baudry's Cypris is a living being, and preserves some of\r\nthe individual charm of the model.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  BAUDRY.   CHARLOTTE CORDAY.]\r\n\r\nIt is this breath of realism which gives their attractiveness to\r\nBaudry's pictures in the Paris Opera House. He cannot indeed be ranked\r\nas a truly great master of decorative painting, as the Fragonard of the\r\nnineteenth century; he was too eclectic. The five years, from 1851 to\r\n1856, which as winner of the Prix de Rome he spent in the Villa Medici,\r\nwere the happiest of his life. He saw in the Italian galleries neither\r\nHolbein nor Velasquez, neither Rembrandt nor Botticelli nor Caravaggio.\r\nHe saw nothing and revered nothing save the pure tradition of the\r\nCinquecento, which was to him the Alpha and Omega of art. He dreamed of\r\ngreat decorative works which should place him on an equality with those\r\nold masters. It was therefore joyful news to him when, at the suggestion\r\nof his old comrade Charles Garnier, he was commissioned to adorn the\r\nOpera House. Baudry was then thirty-five years old, in possession of\r\nhis full powers, and yet he thought it necessary to go back to Italy to\r\ninterrogate the masters of the Renaissance anew. For a full year he\r\nworked ten hours daily in the Sistine Chapel. As soon as he knew Michael\r\nAngelo by heart, he betook himself to England to copy Raphael's\r\ncartoons, and then in 1870 for the third time to Italy, before he felt\r\nhimself capable of covering the five hundred square metres of canvas.\r\nThe task took him four years, and when it was exhibited at the Palais\r\ndes Beaux-Arts in 1874, prior to being placed in its final\r\nresting-place, there was general astonishment at a single man's power to\r\nproduce so much and such great work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  BAUDRY.   TRUTH.]\r\n\r\nTo-day his praise cannot be sounded so high. The place to which he\r\naspired, by the side of the great masters of the Renaissance, will not\r\nfall to Baudry's lot; he is hardly to be reckoned even among the great\r\nFrench masters of the nineteenth century. To rise even so far he lacked\r\nthe first and most essential gift--originality. He was a model pupil in\r\nhis youth, and a pupil he remained all his life. He always saw nature\r\nthrough the medium of art, and never had the courage to take a fresh\r\nbreath and plunge into its fountain of youth. Between him and reality\r\nthere was ever the prism of the old pictures that he loved; brush in\r\nhand, he devoted himself, turn by turn, and with equal enthusiasm, to\r\nMichael Angelo, Titian, Correggio, Bronzino, and even Ingres. As soon as\r\nhe returned from Italy for the first time, as holder of the Prix de\r\nRome, he exhibited several pictures which were altogether Titian in\r\ncolouring, altogether Raphael in style. Each of them, even the most\r\nimportant, calls some other painting to one's mind. His \"Fortune and the\r\nChild\" is a variation upon Titian's \"Divine and Earthly Love\"; his\r\n\"Death of a Vestal Virgin\" a reminiscence of the \"Death of Peter\r\nMartyr\"; his \"Warrior\" in the Opera House is the painted double of\r\nRude's \"Marseillaise.\" How many gestures, attitudes, and figures could,\r\nby a close analysis, be shown to be borrowed in turn from Veronese,\r\nAndrea del Sarto, Correggio, or Raphael! His works are a synthesis of\r\nthe favourite forms of the Cinquecento; they are the testament of the\r\nCinquecento masters. He was a Parisian Primaticcio, a posthumous member\r\nof the old school of Fontainebleau. In him was embodied the last smile\r\nof the Renaissance, the results of which he assimilated and reduced to\r\nformulæ. He lacked creative imagination, and his pictures are wanting in\r\nindividual character. The nervous movement and sinewy stretchings of his\r\nyoung men's bodies would never have been painted but for Donatello's\r\n\"David.\" Of his women, the powerful and muscular are descended from\r\nMichael Angelo's \"Eve,\" the more slender and elegant come down from\r\nRosso. His palette, with its blue and white tints, is bright and\r\nflowery, but it is no less artificial than his composition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  BAUDRY.   THE PEARL AND THE WAVE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Mr. W. H. Stewart, the owner of the picture._)]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it would be unjust to speak of Baudry's work as merely\r\nfaded Classicism, or as Michael Angelo and water. He was not merely a\r\npupil of the Italians; he contributed something Parisian of his own,\r\nsomething pretty, mannered, refined, graceful, seductive, and smiling,\r\nand felt himself independent enough to give to his conventional figures\r\nthis sprightly addition of genuinely modern nervosity. The\r\nbirth-certificates of his young men were drawn up in Florence, those of\r\nhis young women in Rome, three hundred and fifty years ago; yet there is\r\nin the latter something of the _Parisienne_, in the former something of\r\nthe modern dandies who know the fevered life of the Boulevards. In his\r\ndelightful art there is French wit, there is a touch of the piquant, of\r\nthe feminine, of the ambiguous, which almost amounts to indecency. One\r\ncan still recognise the charming model in the figures of his dancers and\r\nMuses; you can see that Music's or Poetry's waist was laced up in a\r\nclose-fitting corset before she sat for the picture. One may meet these\r\nwomen at any moment, trailing their dresses along the sidewalks of the\r\nBoulevards, or riding negligently in their carriages back from the Bois\r\nde Boulogne. And still more modern than the wasp-like form of the body\r\nis the character of the face and the smile on the lips. Thus Baudry has\r\ngiven a new shade to the manner in which one can obtain inspiration from\r\nthe old masters. To all that he borrowed he added a personal and\r\ncharming note. He possesses an elegance and grace which are neither\r\nCorreggio's, nor Raphael's, nor Veronese's, but French and Parisian. His\r\nMuses and Cupids, his \"Comedy\" and his \"Judgment of Paris,\" are\r\ndocuments of the French spirit in the nineteenth century, and--together\r\nwith a few small and fine portraits on a green or blue background _à la_\r\nClouet, among which that of his friend About takes the first rank--they\r\nwill always assure him an important place in the history of French art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  BAUDRY.   CYBELE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Marquise Arconati-Visconti, the owner of the\r\n  picture._) ]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAUDRY.   LEDA.]\r\n\r\nAnother artist who worked with Baudry at the decoration of the Grand\r\nOpera House was _Élie Delaunay_, who painted in a hall leading out of\r\nthe foyer three large pictures on the myths of Apollo, Orpheus, and\r\nAmphion, and was at that time less appreciated than he deserved.\r\nDelaunay was born in the same year as Baudry, and, like him, was a\r\nBreton. In their genius also they are very similar. He shared in\r\nBaudry's admiration of the masters of the Renaissance, but his worship\r\nwas less for the Cinquecento than the fourteenth century. It was in\r\nFlandrin's studio that he prepared himself for his entry into the École\r\ndes Beaux Arts. His first picture, in 1849, \"Christ healing a Leper,\"\r\nwas, with respect to its Roman manner of conceiving form and its\r\nbronze-like firm draughtsmanship, still entirely in the style of Ingres.\r\nIt was not till he went to Italy in 1856, as winner of the Prix de Rome,\r\nthat he turned from the works of the Roman school to those of the early\r\nRenaissance masters, to whom he was attracted by their rigorous study\r\nof form and their manly severity. His sketch books were filled with\r\ndrawings after Paolo Uccello, Filippo Lippi, Pollajualo, Ghirlandajo,\r\nBotticelli, Gozzoli, and Signorelli. It was just at this time that\r\nFrench sculpture was making its significant revolt against the antique\r\nand in favour of Donatello, Verrocchio, and Della Robbia; that the Prix\r\nde Florence was founded, and that Paul Dubois' \"Florentine Singer\"\r\nappeared. Delaunay became as a pupil of the Quattrocento masters one of\r\nthe greatest draughtsmen of the century, a healthy Naturalist in the\r\nsense in which the Primitives were so, with a concise and firm power of\r\ndesign which only Ingres amongst modern French painters shares with him.\r\nThe bodies of his nude male figures are strained in nerve and muscle\r\nlike those of Donatello; they have the essential elegance and powerful\r\nrhythm of Dubois' statues. Even the two pictures which he sent from\r\nItaly to the Salon, \"The Nymph Hesperia fleeing from the Pursuit of\r\nÆsacus,\" and the \"Lesson on the Flute\" in the Museum at Nantes, were\r\nworks of great taste and sincerity, studied with respectful and patient\r\ndevotion to nature, without striving after sentimental effect and\r\nwithout conventional reminiscences. When in 1861 he returned from Rome,\r\nhe completed the frescoes in the church of St. Nicholas in Nantes,\r\nwhich, in their strict severity, remind one of Signorelli's Cycle at\r\nOrvieto. In 1865 appeared in the Salon his \"Plague at Rome,\" which\r\nafterwards passed into the Luxembourg, and which is not devoid of tragic\r\naccent. In that collection hangs also his \"Diana\" of 1872, a proud nude\r\nfigure drawn with firm and manly lines, and full of grave dignity, after\r\nthe manner of Feuerbach. At the same time as his \"Diana\" he exhibited\r\nhis portrait of a Mlle. Lechat, seated like one of Botticelli's Madonnas\r\nin front of a trellis of roses--in the style of the old masters, and yet\r\nmodern, naturalistic, and in excellent taste. Thenceforth he took his\r\nplace among the first portrait painters of his time. There is an\r\ninexorable love of truth, a something bronze-like and stony in his\r\npictures, finished as they are with the firm impress of medals.\r\nInstances of this may be found in his fine portrait of Mme. Toulmouche,\r\nwhom he has represented in a white summer costume, with black gloves,\r\nseated in the midst of cheerful landscape; and also in several male\r\nheads drawn with that firmness of modelling which Bronzino in his best\r\ndays alone possessed. After the completion of the Opera paintings he\r\nfinished, in 1876, twelve decorative pictures for the great hall of the\r\nCouncil of State in the Palais Royal. His last works, which remained\r\nunfinished, were designs for the Pantheon--scenes from the life of St.\r\nGeneviève--in which he followed in the footsteps of the great fresco\r\ncolourists of Upper Italy, Gaudenzio Ferrari and Pordenone. Élie\r\nDelaunay was no original genius, and as a pupil of the painters of the\r\nQuattrocento has not enriched the history of art in any way, but he\r\nstands forth, in a time which cared for nothing but external effect, as\r\na very loyal, serious, and honest artist, whose works all bear the stamp\r\nof a healthy, manly spirit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  BAUDRY.   EDMOND ABOUT.]\r\n\r\nThough in the works of these masters the Classicism of Ingres passes\r\naway, in part enfeebled and in part imbued with modern elements and\r\nvivified by a more direct study of nature, yet on the whole Paul\r\nDelaroche dominates this period also. Historical painting takes the\r\nhighest places in the Salon, and shows itself altered only in this\r\nrespect, that, instead of Delaroche's tameness of style, we have\r\nsensational subjects, arguments which revel in scenes of horror and\r\ndisplay of corpses. Literature had already entered upon this path. Even\r\nMérimée in his last novel, _Lokis_, was clearly the forerunner of that\r\ntendency in taste which Taine characterised by the words, \"_Depuis dix\r\nans une nuance de brutalité complète l'élégance_.\" Flaubert himself, in\r\nhis _Salambo_, was to some extent carried away by the stream. Consider,\r\nfor instance, the descriptions of Gisko crawling, a maimed, shapeless\r\nstump, out of the ditch into Matho's tent, and of how his head is sawn\r\noff; of the tortures inflicted by the Carthaginian people upon the\r\ncaptured Matho; or of how the mercenaries are starved to death in the\r\nrocky valley where they were imprisoned. Vying with this tendency of\r\nliterature, painting attained in its chosen themes an over-excitation\r\nwhich reached the limits of the possible. While Delaroche had only in a\r\nvery timid manner led the way to the tragedies of history, the younger\r\nartists hunted up all the most horrible deeds of blood to be found in\r\nthe great Book of Martyrs of the story of man, and elaborated them on\r\ngigantic canvases. It would be quite impossible to draw up a catalogue\r\nof all the murders at that time perpetrated by French art. They might be\r\narranged under various headings, as biblical, historical, political\r\nmurders; murders in connection with robbery, and murders arising out of\r\nrevenge; with subdivisions corresponding to the means employed, as\r\npoison, the dagger, the halter, broadsword and rapier, the bowstring,\r\nstrangling, burning, etc. This was the time when, on account of this\r\ndominance of the \"_Genre féroce_,\" the public used to call the Salon the\r\nMorgue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  DELAUNAY.   DIANA.]\r\n\r\n_Toudouze_ painted the \"Fall of Sodom\" with a dozen copper-coloured\r\nAbyssinians, larger than life, rolling on the ground in convulsions,\r\nwhile Lot's wife, dying and half-consumed by fire, gnashes her teeth as\r\nshe raises the corpse of her child over her head. In a picture of\r\n_George Becker's_ were represented the corpses of King Saul's sons,\r\ndelivered over by David to the Gibeonites, hanging alongside of each\r\nother in a dark forest scene on a cross-shaped framework, like butcher's\r\nmeat from the shambles. Their mother stands beneath the scaffold,\r\nswinging a knotted club to protect the corpses from an antediluvian\r\nvulture. In a painting by _Bréhan_, Cyaxares, King of the Medes, gives a\r\nbanquet, and by way of dessert has his guests the Scythian leaders\r\nmassacred by his mercenaries. In one by _Matthieu_, Heliogabalus has hit\r\nupon a yet happier idea, for at the conclusion of the meal he sets\r\nhalf-starved lions and tigers upon his guests. _Aimé Morot_ depicted in\r\na large picture \"The Wives of the Ambrones\" in the battle of Aquæ\r\nSextiæ. They are hurling themselves like a horde of furies upon the\r\nRoman horsemen who are attacking the camp. Half-naked, or entirely so,\r\nwith their hair flowing behind them, they throw themselves upon the\r\nRomans, catch hold of the swords by the blade, tear their eyes out, and\r\nare trampled beneath the horses' hoofs. Especially popular were the\r\nvoluptuous and cruel wild beasts from the menagerie of the Cæsars. Nero\r\nin particular suited the atmosphere of the period; his ghost haunted the\r\nnovel, the stage, sculpture, and painting, and there seemed to be a\r\ngeneral agreement to immortalise him and the morally monstrous\r\npersonality of Locusta. In a picture by _Sylvestre_ he is represented\r\nwith florid cheeks, glowing with fat, and gloating over the mortal agony\r\nof a slave lying on the ground, upon whom Locusta has tested the poison\r\nintended for Britannicus. _Aublet_ varied the same theme by making a\r\nnegro lad the victim, while several corpses of negroes lying in the\r\nbackground suggest that the Emperor was not quite satisfied with\r\nLocusta's first experiments. Round Nero, the more entirely to fill his\r\nmagnificent Golden House, the charming shades of his congenial comrades\r\nin crime weave their flitting dances. _Pelez_ depicted the strangling of\r\nthe Emperor Commodus by the gladiator to whom the Empress had entrusted\r\nthe task, and painted with tender interest the marks caused by suffusion\r\nof blood which the athlete's hand had left upon the unhappy prince's\r\nneck. A very familiar figure is that of Seneca, with distorted features,\r\nuttering his last words of wisdom while the blood pours from his opened\r\nveins. After the madness of the Cæsars comes the atrocious history of\r\nthe Merovingian kings. _Luminais_, the painter of Gauls and barbarians,\r\nrepresented in his large picture \"Les Énervés de Jumièges\" the sons of\r\nKing Clovis II, who, after the muscles of their knees have been\r\ndestroyed by fire, are set helplessly adrift in a boat on the Seine.\r\nThen followed torture scenes from the time of the Inquisition, and\r\nsaints burning at the stake. The conception which this post-Romantic\r\ngeneration had of the East was of cruelty and voluptuousness mixed, a\r\nthing pieced together out of white bodies, purple streams of blood, and\r\nbrown backgrounds. Here, the favourite Sultana contemplates the severed\r\nhead of her rival, which stares at her out of its glassy eyes; there,\r\neunuchs are making ready to strangle a woman condemned to death. In\r\nworks such as these the genius, powerful in composition, of Benjamin\r\nConstant, celebrates its triumphs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  DELAUNAY.   BOYS SINGING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  DELAUNAY.   MADAME TOULMOUCHE.]\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding all the means of allurement furnished by such\r\nthemes, these paintings almost invariably fail to produce the\r\nanticipated effect. Not that it is the brutality of the subjects that\r\nmakes them unpleasant. Art in all times has busied itself with the\r\nhorrible. How voluptuously does Dante depict the horrors of Hell! What\r\nimagination was ever peopled with figures more dreadful than those\r\nconceived by Shakespeare? Cruelty and death have a poetry of their own:\r\nwhy should Art prudishly abstain from depicting them? Only, if the\r\nresult is to be a good picture, the subject must be in strict congruity\r\nwith the talent employed upon it, and in the majority of these works\r\nthis conformity is lacking. The subjects alone had become more savage\r\nand brutal. In the manner of treatment there is none of the wild effect\r\nwhich the Neapolitans of the seventeenth century gave to their scenes of\r\nmartyrdom. Spirits truly wild, like Delacroix and Caravaggio, are not to\r\nbe met with every day. The painters who launched out upon these\r\nbloodthirsty themes took absolutely no inward \"enjoyment in tragical\r\nsubjects,\" but simply painted them as if after precepts learned at\r\nschool. And as they were also deficient in that knowledge of nature\r\nwhich is acquired only by direct study of life, not one of them was in a\r\nposition to give to his historical scenes that naturalistic weight which\r\nalone gives to such themes a character of convincing probability. True,\r\nthese pictures compel respect on account of their unusual ability. These\r\nnaked bodies, twisting themselves in the most varying postures of pain,\r\ngive proof by their correct draughtsmanship of the most painstaking\r\nanatomical studies, yet after all they are nothing more than inverted\r\nLaocoöns. The Classical spirit haunts them still, and a discordant\r\neffect is produced when subjects so full of wild passion are tranquilly\r\ndepicted according to cold conventional rules. Over all these figures\r\nand scenes, even the most horrible, lies the veil of a Classical\r\nembellishment, which deprives them altogether of that directness which\r\nlays hold on the imagination. The pictures are good studies of costume,\r\nand make an admirable impression by their resplendent glow of colour;\r\nthey are show-pieces, brilliant stage effects, as happily conceived as\r\nany of Sardou's. But the recipe for their production is still that of\r\nthe school of Delaroche: avoidance of all extremes, generalised forms,\r\ncareful composition, crude lukewarmness, or the affectation of daring.\r\nScarce one of these painters has given to his wild subject an equal\r\nwildness of treatment; not one has raised himself from the paltry level\r\nof Delaroche to the artistic height of Delacroix.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L'Art._\r\n\r\n  SYLVESTRE.   LOCUSTA TESTING IN NERO'S PRESENCE POISON PREPARED FOR\r\n  BRITANNICUS.]\r\n\r\n_Laurens_ alone, surnamed by his comrades \"the Benedictine,\" because his\r\npredilection was for forgotten themes from ecclesiastical history,\r\nconstitutes in a certain sense an exception to the rule. He too belongs\r\nto the group of historical painters whose theory is that a picture\r\nshould represent an historical fact with absolute accuracy. But he is\r\nmore masculine than Delaroche. His personages are truer to nature, or,\r\nif one will, less banal; the general effect is warmer and fuller of\r\nlife; he has a greater power of attracting attention. There is nothing\r\ngreat in his work, but there is no cold pedantry: the art of combination\r\nis more adroit, so that one is less aware of calculation, and may\r\nsometimes observe a grim earnestness. He really loves the terrible,\r\nwhile the others merely made use of it for the manufacture of what are\r\nnothing more than tableaux. To the Inquisition especially he was\r\nindebted for notable successes, and at times he was able to depict its\r\ndark scenes of horror in a very subtle manner. When he heaps up, in\r\nfront of a church, corpses to which the priests have refused burial;\r\nwhen he disinters popes in order to place them in the dock before their\r\naccusers; when he opens coffins to reveal the decomposed features of\r\nsome erstwhile beauty, he sets even blunted nerves on the stretch; and\r\nas he has therein attained the goal he had proposed to himself, his art\r\nis not without its justification.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L'Art._\r\n\r\n  LUMINAIS.   LES ÉNERVÉS DE JUMIÈGES.]\r\n\r\nAmong the younger generation, _Rochegrosse_, an artist of daring genius,\r\nappeared for a while to have taken to such themes by free choice, and\r\nnot solely through the traditions of the studio. One seemed to observe\r\nin his works a truly emotional temperament flaming behind the trammels\r\nof conventionality, and was almost inclined to rank him among the\r\nspirits of storm and stress who trace their descent from Delacroix.\r\nAfter his first picture, in which \"Vitellius\" is represented dragged\r\nthrough the streets of Rome and ill treated by the populace, he achieved\r\nsuccess with a scene taken from the destruction of Troy. Here\r\n\"Andromache,\" raging with impotent anguish, is struggling against a\r\nnumber of Greeks who have snatched her child from her arms to throw it\r\ndown from the ramparts. This brutal strife is depicted with the highest\r\nnaturalistic power. Neither the heroine nor the warriors belong to the\r\nideal figures of the style of compromise. Andromache is of a fulness of\r\nform almost approaching corpulence, and the Greeks remind one of Indians\r\non the warpath. Mangled corpses complete the picture, and on the bare\r\nwall to the left, over the stairs, hang dead bodies abandoned to\r\ncorruption and the birds of prey. In his third picture he took for his\r\ntheme the horrors of the barbarous and ferocious Peasants' War in the\r\nfourteenth century, as Mérimée had described them in his book entitled\r\n_La Jacquerie_; and his work is all the more effective as there lurks in\r\nthe subject a certain grim modern touch which reminds one of the Social\r\nDemocracy, of the insurrection of the Commune, of something which might\r\nhappen even to-day. The insurgents break into the hall, where the ladies\r\nof the castle have taken refuge with their children. One alone stands\r\nerect, the grandmother in her nun-like widow's dress, and stretches her\r\narms behind her with a gesture of energy, as if to shield the younger\r\nones at her back. The foremost intruder ironically takes off his cap.\r\nAnother lifts up on his pike the fair-haired, bleeding head of the lord\r\nof the castle; a third has similarly transfixed his reeking heart.\r\nOthers are pressing in from without, breaking the window panes with\r\ntheir weapons, which are yet dripping with blood. Beneath frightful\r\nfigures are seen, the most horrible that of a woman standing on the\r\nwindow-sill, her hands propped upon her knees, gazing with insane\r\nlaughter upon the mortal terror of the aristocratic ladies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  LAURENS.   THE INTERDICT.]\r\n\r\nIn his subsequent pictures Rochegrosse did not go so far afield. His\r\n\"Murder of Julius Cæsar\" was a work of art in white upon white, full of\r\ncrude imagination, with white walls, white reflections of light, white\r\ntogas, and dark red blotches of blood. His grass-eating \"Nebuchadnezzar\"\r\nproved that from the sublime to the ridiculous there is often only a\r\nstep. Between times he painted archæological trifles for ladies of\r\nliterary culture, such as the \"Battle of the Sparrows\" of 1890; but in\r\nhis great \"Fall of Babylon\" he has proved once more what he can do. No\r\ndoubt it is not a fine work: it is a mere decorative piece, but an\r\nastonishingly spirited performance. The scene is the palace of the\r\nBabylonian kings, the decorative construction of which the recovered\r\nmonuments and the recent scientific investigations had rendered it\r\npossible to reproduce. Rochegrosse consulted with the zeal of an\r\narchæologist all the treasures of the Louvre and the British\r\nMuseum,--Assyrian friezes, ornaments, and costumes,--and then set forth\r\nin these surroundings the famous banquet at which the Prophet Daniel\r\nexplained the words \"Mene, Tekel, Peres.\" The day begins to break; in\r\nthe distance the army of the Medes advancing to attack the palace has\r\nburst open the gate; Belshazzar leaves the table in terror, and takes to\r\nhis weapons; the naked women, still intoxicated, stretch their limbs, or\r\nremain lazily indifferent lying on the ground; around is a dazzling\r\nconfusion of mosaics, of polychrome architecture, of fantastic images of\r\nanimals, of glittering tapestries shot with many hues and pleasing to\r\nthe eye; of flowers, vases, fruits, pastry, and nude bodies of women.\r\nThe grey light of morning strives to overcome that of the\r\nhalf-extinguished lamps, and rests with leaden weight upon the gigantic\r\nstill-life below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  REGNAULT.   SALOME.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Georges Petit, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nIf some portion of Delacroix's wild genius appears to have descended\r\nupon Rochegrosse, yet was _Henri Regnault_, as a colourist, the greatest\r\nof Delacroix's heirs--even allowing for the exaggerated renown which\r\ncame to him in France, from the fact that he was the last to fall in the\r\nwar of 1870. His portrait of \"General Prim\" of 1869, which, rejected by\r\nthe sitter, came eventually to the Louvre, is somewhat reminiscent of\r\nVelasquez and Delacroix, but is nevertheless, with those of Géricault,\r\namongst the finest equestrian portraits of the century. In his \"Salome\"\r\nhe has depicted a black-haired girl with twitching feet, resting upon a\r\nstool after her dance, and contemplating with the cruelty of a tigress\r\nthe platter which she holds ready for the head of John the Baptist,\r\nwhile her glowing red mouth with its dazzling teeth smiles like that of\r\nan innocent child. In her he has embodied with infernal subtlety the\r\ndemon of voluptuous wantonness, and has composed a symphony in yellow\r\nof seductive and dazzling charm. She is attired in transparent\r\ngold-inwoven robes, which have a caressing congruity with the\r\nresplendent texture of the background.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L'Art._\r\n\r\n  REGNAULT.   THE MOORISH HEADSMAN.]\r\n\r\nHis \"Moorish Headsman\" is a symphony in red. In his pale rose-red garb\r\nthe tall Moor stands in majestic dignity, wipes a few drops of blood\r\nfrom the blade of his sword, and glances with careless indifference--a\r\ntype of the dreamy cruelty of Oriental fatalism--without anger and\r\nwithout pity, without hatred and without satisfaction, upon the severed\r\nhead with its distorted eyes, which, rolling down a couple of steps, has\r\nstained the white marble with purple patches of blood. \"I will cause the\r\ngenuine Moors to rise again, at once rich and great, terrible and\r\nvoluptuous,\"--so the voice of Delacroix speaks out of this picture by\r\nRegnault. His paintings, like those of his master, have the effect of\r\nsplendid Oriental costumes; they are shot with every hue, they lighten\r\nand glisten, they are inwoven with magnificent arabesques of gold and\r\nsilver, with sparkling embroideries and precious stones. The \"Orlando\r\nFurioso\" of art lives once more in these fascinating harmonies, in the\r\npower, splendour, and lustre of the colouring. Just as Baudry at the\r\nclose of the Classical period produced in his paintings for the Opera\r\nHouse the noblest work after the idealist formulæ, so Regnault in his\r\n\"Salome\" and his \"Prim\" has completed the last defiant works of the\r\nformulæ of Romanticism.\r\n\r\nWe have thought it advisable to follow this development of the art of\r\npainting down to its close, just as in treating of the older periods we\r\nhave proceeded, not upon chronological principles, but upon those of\r\nhistorical style. Now that the old art has been followed to the grave,\r\nit will be all the easier, later on, to perceive clearly how the new\r\narose slowly out of its invisible depths. And as France since 1830 has\r\nbecome the high school of art for other nations, those paths have at the\r\nsame time been indicated along which the art of painting was proceeding\r\nduring these years in other countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRI REGNAULT   GENERAL PRÍM]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORICAL SCHOOL OF PAINTING IN BELGIUM\r\n\r\n\r\nBelgian art had gone through the same history as French art since David.\r\nWhen the French patriarch came to Brussels to pass the remainder of his\r\ndays there in honour, he found the ground already well prepared. The\r\nClassicists had long since made their way into art, and the old Flemish\r\ntradition was dying out. Lens and Herreyns are the last colourists in\r\nthe sense of the good old time, but they are associated with the good\r\nold time only through the qualities of their colouring. As a degenerate\r\ndescendant of Van Dyck, _Lens_ painted with a feeble brush sweet,\r\ninsipid, sugary work for boudoirs and _prie-dieu_ chairs; and had lost\r\nhis feeling for nature to such a degree that he gave the aged the same\r\nflesh tint as children, and men the full breasts of hermaphrodites.\r\n_Herreyns_, appointed director of the Antwerp Academy in 1800, was more\r\nmasculine; and although likewise conventional and wanting in\r\nindividuality, he was none the less a painter of breadth and boldness.\r\nHe was most enraptured with a model with a copper-coloured skin and\r\nknotted muscles, or with pretty and ruddy children, and fat nurses with\r\nswelling breasts. This bold worker embodied in his own person the art of\r\na great epoch, but did nothing to renew it. These painters, indeed, only\r\nmixed for a new hash the crumbs fallen from the table at which giants\r\nhad once sat. They looked backwards instead of around them, and lighted\r\ntheir modest little lamp at the sun of Rubens. France was the only\r\ncountry where art followed the great changes of culture in the age.\r\nHence Flemish painting had been crossed with French elements long before\r\nDavid's arrival. And Paris was for the artists of 1800 what Italy had\r\nbeen for those of 1600. They made their pilgrimage in troops to the\r\nstudio of Suvée, who had originally come from Bruges, but had lived\r\nsince 1771 on the Seine. There, and there only, recipes for the\r\ncomposition of great figure pictures were to be obtained. And thus art\r\ncompleted what the Empire had in a political sense begun. The artistic\r\nbarriers fell as the geographical ones had done before, and the Belgian\r\npainters went back to Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent, and Bruges as men\r\nannexed by France.\r\n\r\nDavid on his arrival needed only to shake the tree and the fruit fell\r\nripe into his lap. He entered Flanders like a conqueror, and left the\r\nsigns of ravage behind him on his triumphal progress. In Brussels a\r\ncourt gathered round him as round a banished king, and a gold medal was\r\nstruck in memory of his arrival. He took Flemish art in his powerful\r\nhands and crushed it. For, needless to say, he saw nothing but barbarism\r\nin the genius of Rubens, and inoculated Flemish artists with a genuine\r\nhorror of their great prince of painters. He continued to teach in\r\nBrussels what he had preached in Paris, and became the father-in-law of\r\na deadly tiresome Franco-Belgian school, to which belonged a succession\r\nof correct painters; men such as Duvivier, Ducq, Paelinck, Odevaere, and\r\nothers. For the aboriginal, sturdy, energetic, and carnal Flemish art\r\nwas prescribed the mathematical regularity of the antique canon. The old\r\nFlemish joyousness of colour passed into a consumptive cacophony. And\r\nthen was repeated in Belgium the tragedy which Classicism had played in\r\nFrance. Everything became a pretext for draperies, stiff poses,\r\nsculptural groupings, and plaster heads. Phædra and Theseus, Hector and\r\nAndromache, Paris and Helen, were, as in Paris, the most popular\r\nsubjects. And so great a confusion reigned, that a sculptor from whom a\r\nwolf was ordered included the history of Romulus and Remus gratuitously.\r\n\r\nThe only one whose works are still partially enjoyable is _Navez_. He\r\nwas, like Ingres in France, the last prop of this art, chiselled, as it\r\nwere, out of stone; and even after the fall of Classicism he remained in\r\nesteem, because, like Ingres, he knew how to steer a prudent course\r\nbetween David, the Italians, and a certain independent study of nature.\r\nA touch of realism was mingled with his mania for the Greeks; only to a\r\nlimited extent did he correct \"ugly\" nature; he would have ventured to\r\nrepresent Socrates with his negro nose and Thersites with his hump, and,\r\nagain, like Ingres he has left behind him enduring performances as a\r\nportrait painter. His correct, cold, and discreet talent grew warm at\r\nthe touch of human personality, and his drawings, in particular, prove\r\nthat he had warmth of feeling as an artist. As his biographer tells us,\r\nhe seldom laid down the sketch-book in which he fixed his impressions as\r\nhe talked. Every page was filled with sketches of a group, a figure, or\r\na gesture seen in the street and rapidly dashed off, \"as realistically\r\nas even Courbet could desire.\" And these he transferred, when he painted\r\nin the \"noble style.\"\r\n\r\nAs Navez had importance as an artist, so had _Matthias van\r\nBree_--Herreyns' successor in the directorate of the Antwerp\r\nAcademy--importance as a teacher. He worked in Belgium, like Gros in\r\nParis, only in another way. While Gros as an artist was the forerunner\r\nof Romanticism, and as a teacher an orthodox Classicist, Van Bree is\r\ntedious as an artist, but as a teacher he fanned in the young generation\r\na glowing love for old Flemish art. No one spoke of Rubens, Van Dyck,\r\nand the great art of the seventeenth century with so much warmth and\r\nunderstanding; and whilst with the charcoal in his hand he composed\r\nbuckram cartoons, he dreamt of a youth who should arise to renew the old\r\nFlemish tradition.\r\n\r\nBefore long this young man had grown up. He had seen the artistic\r\ntreasures of Antwerp and Paris. Here Rubens had delighted his eyes, and\r\nthere Paul Veronese. As he admired both in the Louvre, he heard behind\r\nhim the voice of the young Romanticists who, like him, had an enthusiasm\r\nfor colour and movement, and blasphemed the stiff, colourless old David.\r\n_Gustav Wappers_, also, had paid toll to Classicism, and painted in 1823\r\na \"Regulus\" after the well-known recipe. All the greater was the\r\nastonishment when, in 1830, he came forward with his \"Burgomaster van\r\nder Werff\": \"Burgomaster van der Werff of Leyden, at the siege of the\r\ntown in 1576, offers his own body as food to the famished citizens.\" The\r\nvery subject could not fail to create enthusiasm in the great body of\r\nthe people, excited as they were by ideas of liberty: the brilliant\r\nmethod of presentation did this no less. What the old Van Bree looked\r\nfor, the return to the splendour of colour and sensuous fulness of life\r\nof the old masters, was achieved in this picture. In the same year, when\r\nBelgium had won her nationality and independence once more, a painter\r\nalso ventured to break away from the French formulæ of Classicism, and\r\nto treat a national theme in the manner of those painters who in former\r\ncenturies had been the glory of Flanders. Wappers was greeted as a\r\nnational hero; his part it was to bring to an issue with the brush that\r\ngood fight which others had fought with the musket and sabre. His\r\npicture was a sign of the delivery of Flemish art from the French house\r\nof bondage. Whilst older men were horrified, as the followers of the\r\nschool of Delaroche were afterwards horrified at the \"Stone-breakers\" of\r\nCourbet, the younger generation looked up to Wappers as a Messiah.\r\nEverything in the Brussels Salon faded before the freshness of the new\r\nwork; a springtide in painting seemed to be at hand, and the wintry\r\nrigidity of Classicism was warmed by a burst of sunshine, the old gods\r\ntrembled and felt their Olympus quake. Gustav Wappers was held to be the\r\nleader of a new Renaissance. In him the great era of the seventeenth\r\ncentury was to be continued. The iridescence of silken stuffs, the whole\r\ncolour and festal joyousness of the old masters, were found once more.\r\nAs in France there rose the shout, \"An Ingres, a Delacroix!\" so there\r\nresounded in Belgium the battle-cry, \"A Navez, a Wappers!\" The picture\r\nwas bought by King William II of Holland, and in 1832 Wappers was made\r\nProfessor of the Antwerp Academy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bruyllant, Brussels._\r\n\r\n  GUSTAV WAPPERS.]\r\n\r\nThe Exhibition of 1834 confirmed him in his new position as head of a\r\nschool. This was a genuine triumph, which he gained by his \"Episode in\r\nthe Belgian Revolution of 1830.\" A scene out of the blood-stained days\r\nof the street fights in Brussels--that glorious final chapter of the\r\nstruggle of the Belgian people for freedom from the French yoke--was\r\nnothing less than an event in which every one had recently taken part.\r\nAt a period when so few realised how closely the great masters of the\r\npast were bound to their own time and imbibed from it their strength and\r\nnourishment, this new painter, in defiance of all theories, had drawn\r\nboldly from life. This picture was regarded as \"a hymn of jubilation for\r\nwhat was attained and a threnody for the sacrifice it had cost.\" And the\r\nneighbourhood of the church, where he had laid the action, stamped it\r\nalmost as the votive picture of the Belgian people for its dead. On the\r\nright an artisan standing aloft upon a newly thrown up earthwork is\r\nreading to his attentive comrades the rejected proclamation of the\r\nPrince of Orange. On the left a reinforcement is coming up. In the\r\nforeground boys are tearing up the pavement or beating the drum; and\r\nhere and there are enacted various tragical family scenes. Here a young\r\nwife with a child on her arm clings with all the strength of despair to\r\nher husband, who resists her and finally tears himself from her grasp\r\nand hurries to the barricade--the cry of love is drowned amid the clash\r\nof arms. There, supported on the knee of his grey-headed father, rests a\r\nhandsome young fellow with closing eyes and the death-wound in his\r\nheart. It seems as though the Horatian _dulce et decorum est_ might be\r\nsaid to wander over his features and to glorify them. For patriotism as\r\nwell as for mere sentiment, here are noble scenes enough and to spare.\r\nNot only all Brussels, but all Belgium, made a pilgrimage to Wappers'\r\ncreation. Every mother beheld her lost son in the youth in the\r\nforeground whose life has been sacrificed; every artisan's wife sought\r\nher husband, her brother, or her father amongst the figures of the\r\nfighting-men on the barricades. All the newspapers were full of praise,\r\nand a subscription was set on foot to strike a medal in commemoration of\r\nthe picture. If, up to this time, Wappers had been merely praised as the\r\nrenewer of Belgian art, he was now placed alongside of the greatest\r\nmasters. Thiers induced him to exhibit in Paris the much discussed work,\r\nthe fame of which had passed beyond the boundaries of Belgium. The\r\n\"Episode\" made a triumphal tour of all the great towns of Europe before\r\nit found its home in the Musée Moderne; and Wappers' fame abroad\r\nincreased yet more his celebrity in Flanders. Thanks to him, the\r\nneighbouring nations began to interest themselves in the Belgian school.\r\nAll were united in admiration of \"the mighty conception and the\r\nharmonious scheme of colour.\" The German _Morgenblatt_ published a study\r\nof him in 1836. Wappers counted as the leading painter of his country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bruyllant, Brussels._\r\n\r\n  WAPPERS.   THE SACRIFICE OF BURGOMASTER VAN DER WERFF AT THE SIEGE OF\r\n  LEYDEN.]\r\n\r\nYet the same year brought him his first rivals. His entry on the stage\r\nhad given strength to a group of young painters belonging to the same\r\ncourageous movement, and the Brussels Salon of 1836 concentrated their\r\nefforts. _Nicaise de Keyzer_ made his appearance in heavy armour. As\r\nearly as 1834 he had come forward with a great picture, a Crucifixion,\r\nin which he desired to compete with Rubens, as it seemed, in the\r\nlatter's most special province. Yet the work merely testified to its\r\nauthor's excellent memory: the majority of the heads, gestures, and\r\ndraperies had been made use of in old pictures in precisely the same\r\nfashion. Consciously or not, he had copied fragments direct, and welded\r\nthem together in a new composition. If, in spite of this, the name of de\r\nKeyzer already flew from mouth to mouth, he owed it to the nimbus of\r\nromance which irradiated his person. The story went that an Antwerp lady\r\non one of her walks had seen a young man drawing in the sand, while his\r\nflock was at pasture not far off. She stepped up and offered him a\r\npencil, and he, a new Cimabue, began forthwith to sketch a picture of\r\nthe Madonna. The drawing was so beautiful (so the tale ran) that the\r\nlady would have held it a sin to allow the genius to end his days as a\r\nshepherd. He came to town, received instruction, and learned to paint. A\r\nlittle idyll illuminated by the amiability of a lady was quite enough to\r\nprepare a friendly reception for De Keyzer. And since he, like a\r\ntractable, modest young man, hearkened attentively to criticism, he\r\nsatisfied all desires when, in 1836, he came forward with his \"Battle of\r\nthe Spurs at Courtrai, 1302.\" In its quiet elegance the work answered to\r\nthe peaceful mood which prevailed once more after the days of revolt and\r\npolitical insurrection. He was given special credit for clearness of\r\ncomposition and antiquarian exactness. De Keyzer had chosen the moment\r\nwhen the Count of Artois was expiring on the knees of a Flemish soldier;\r\nanother Fleming had his arm raised to protect his general from the\r\napproaching French. For the rest, there is a lull in the fight, though\r\nthe battlefield in the background is indicated with the minuteness of an\r\nhistorian: none of those carnages of blood and smoke of which the world\r\nwas grown once more weary, but a correct, well-disciplined battle, a\r\nskilful composition of fine gestures, helmets, cuirasses, and halberts.\r\nEven the Count's spur, says Alvin, is drawn after the original, the only\r\nremaining spur out of seven hundred which lay scattered on the field\r\nafter the day of Courtrai.\r\n\r\nIn the same year _Henri Decaisne_ completed his \"Belges Illustres.\" The\r\nfamous past was supposed to give its blessing to the great present. The\r\nartist, who in Paris had painted portraits with success, had been\r\nesteemed there by Lamartine, and celebrated by Alfred de Musset in a\r\nbrilliant article in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, now gratified a long\r\ncherished desire of the Belgian national pride when he united the heroes\r\nof the land in an ideal gathering.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards _Gallait_ and _Bièfve_ trod the stage of Belgian\r\npainting. In point of size their pictures surpassed all that that age,\r\naccustomed as it was to vast canvases, had yet witnessed. \"The\r\nAbdication of Charles V\" measured twenty feet; it was hung in the Salon\r\nCarré of the Louvre above Paul Veronese's \"Marriage at Cana.\" An entire\r\ncourt of great ladies and gentlemen, clad in velvet and brocade, move in\r\nthe gorgeous hall of state of a king's castle. The solemn moment is\r\nrepresented when Charles V, erect and dominating the entire assembly,\r\ncedes the government of his possessions to Philip: and here is a mine of\r\nprofound criticism of the philosophy of history. This old man, with one\r\nfoot in the grave, whose forceful head still bears, like a Caryatid, the\r\nheavy burden of empire, embodies the splendour, fame, and might of\r\nbygone days. Faltering, he steps down from the throne, as though\r\nhesitating at the last moment whether he should appoint as his successor\r\nthis son whom he both loves and fears; and, lifting to heaven his tired,\r\nsunken eyes, he commends unto God the future of the realm. Philip, the\r\nonly one in the assembly entirely clothed in black, who receives the\r\ngift of dominion with an icy coldness, is transformed by the able\r\nexegesis of the critics into the satanic demon conjuring up the powers\r\nof hell. The picture even gives a glimpse into the future. For as he\r\nspeaks Charles leans his left hand upon the shoulder of another young\r\nman, William of Orange. This indicates that soon the nation will wrest\r\ntheir independence from the double-tongued Jesuitical policy of Philip.\r\nTo the left of this central group, robed in velvet and silk, stand the\r\nladies around Margaret, the sister of the Emperor; she, in the garb of a\r\nnun, sits in her chair as in a _prie-dieu_. To the right, near the\r\nthrone, are pages and priests, and amidst them Egmont and Horn, standing\r\naloof and silent, look upon the scene. \"The Abdication\" had a grand\r\nsuccess. It confirmed the hopes which had been set on Gallait ever since\r\nthe completion of his \"Tasso,\" and it was proudly ranked amongst those\r\nworks which did special honour to the young nation. Wappers saw himself\r\neclipsed, and Louis Gallait took the lead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WAPPERS.   THE DEATH OF COLUMBUS.]\r\n\r\n_Edouard de Bièfve's_ \"Treaty of the Nobles\" formed the historical\r\nsupplement to this work; after the triumph of the kingdom came the\r\ntriumph of the people. The picture represents the signing of the\r\ndefensive league, against the Inquisition and other breaches of\r\nprivilege, which the nobility of the Netherlands entered into in 1566,\r\nin the Castle of Cuylenburg, near Brussels; it was hailed by the\r\n_Berliner Staatszeitung_ as \"a landmark in the chronicle of historical\r\npainting.\"\r\n\r\nThis heroic era of Belgian painting was brought to a close in 1848 by\r\n_Ernest Slingeneyer_, who, as early as 1842, obtained a brilliant\r\nsuccess with his \"Sinking of the French Battleship _Le Vengeur_.\" His\r\n\"Battle of Lepanto\" was the last great historical picture, and the\r\nentire vocabulary of admiration known to art criticism was showered upon\r\nit by the Brussels press.\r\n\r\nEven a new period of religious painting seemed about to dawn. German\r\nart, up to that time little regarded in Belgium, had since the fifties\r\nbeen discussed with considerable detail in the journals, and such names\r\nas Overbeck, W. Schadow, Veit, Cornelius, and Kaulbach had speedily\r\nacquired a favourable reputation. An exhibition of German cartoons\r\ninstituted in Brussels in 1862 served--strangely enough--to sustain this\r\nhigh appreciation. The young nation believed that it could not afford to\r\nlag behind France and Germany, and commissioned two Antwerp painters,\r\nGuffens and Swerts, who had early made themselves familiar with the\r\ntechnique of fresco, to found a Belgian school of monumental painting.\r\nTo this end they entered into a correspondence with the German artists,\r\nand, after long studies in Italy and Germany, adorned with frescoes the\r\nChurch of Notre Dame in St. Nicolas in East Flanders, St. George's\r\nChurch in Antwerp, the town halls of Courtrai and Ypres, a few churches\r\nin England, and the Cathedral of Prague; and on these frescoes Herman\r\nRiegel, in 1883, published a book in two volumes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bruyllant, Brussels._\r\n\r\n  DE KEYZER.]\r\n\r\nAt the present day this religious fresco painting, which handed on the\r\ndoctrine of the German Nazarenes--the doctrine that nothing remained to\r\nthe nineteenth-century artist except to imitate the old Italians as well\r\nas he could--can no longer command such exhaustive disquisition. And not\r\nit alone: the whole \"Belgian artistic revival of 1830\" appears in a\r\nsomewhat dubious light. After the disconsolate wilderness of Classicism\r\nthis period marked an advance. Every Salon brought some new name to\r\nlight. The State had contributed a big budget for art, and extended its\r\nprotecting hand over the \"great painting\" which was the glory of the\r\nyoung nation. What could not be got into the Musée Moderne, founded in\r\n1845, was divided amongst the churches and provincial museums. The\r\nnumber of painters and exhibitions increased very noticeably. Beside the\r\ngreat triennial exhibitions in Brussels, Antwerp, and Ghent, there were\r\nothers in the smaller towns, such as Mons and Mechlin. The Belgian\r\npainters of 1830 appear, no doubt, as great men, when one considers to\r\nwhat a depth art had sunk before their advent. Wappers especially\r\nwidened the horizon, by breaking the formula of Classicism and renewing\r\nthe tradition of the brilliant colourists of the seventeenth century. De\r\nBièfve, De Keyzer, Slingeneyer, severally contributed to the Belgian\r\nRenaissance. The old Flemish race knew itself once more in this fond\r\nquest of beautiful and radiant colouring. The historical painting had\r\neven a certain actual interest. Standing so near to the glorious\r\nSeptember days when the country won its independence, the painters\r\nwished to draw a parallel between the glorious present and the great\r\npast, and to waken patriotic memories by the apotheosis of popular\r\nheroes. And yet the Musée Moderne of Brussels is not one of those\r\ncollections in which one willingly lingers. The works in the old museum,\r\nhard by, have remained fresh and living and in touch with us; those in\r\nthe new gallery seem to be divided from us by centuries. For the\r\nmischief with pictures which do not remain for ever young is precisely\r\nthis--they grow old so very soon. Posterity speaks the language of cold\r\ncriticism; and those powers must be great which are even favoured with a\r\nverdict. The luxuriant wreaths of laurel which fall upon the living are\r\nno guarantee of enduring fame, while in the crowns awarded after death\r\nevery leaf is numbered. In how few of these once lauded works there\r\ndwells the power to speak in an intelligible language to a generation\r\nwhich tests them, not for their patriotism, but for their intrinsic art.\r\nThe Belgian school of 1830 has left behind it the trace of respectable\r\nindustry, but a supreme work is what it has not brought forth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bruyllant, Brussels._\r\n\r\n  DE KEYZER.   THE BATTLE OF WOERINGEN.]\r\n\r\nHow hard it is to see anything epoch-making in Wappers' \"Van der Werff.\"\r\nHow theatrically the figures are posturing, how improbable is the\r\ncomposition, and what an unwholesome dose of sentimentality is to be\r\nfound in that burgomaster, who is offering himself as a prey to the\r\nmultitude! The heads are those of troubadours. And these jerkins brought\r\nfresh out of the wardrobe, these neatly ironed white ruffles, all this\r\nrich velvet and glittering pomp, how little it resembles the torn rags\r\nof a half-starved people after a nine months' siege! His revolutionary\r\npicture of 1834 is an unfortunate transposition into a sentimental key\r\nof the \"Freedom on the Barricades\" by Delacroix. Here also are\r\nplay-actors rather than men and women of the people. This old man who is\r\nkissing the banner, the wife who winds her arms about her husband as\r\nVenus does about Tannhäuser, the pale girl who has fallen in a faint,\r\nthe warrior who, with his eyes turned up to Heaven, is breaking his\r\nsword--these are figures out of a melodrama, not revolutionaries\r\nstorming the barricades, nor famishing artisans fighting for their very\r\nexistence. And the thin, spick-and-span colouring is in just as striking\r\na contrast with the forceful action of the scene. An idyll could not be\r\ncarried out with more prettiness of manner than is this picture which\r\nrepresents the rising of a people. The artisans are as white as\r\nalabaster. A light rouge rests upon the cheeks of the women, as when\r\nBoucher paints the faltering of virtue. And afterwards Wappers' course\r\nwent further and further down hill. Only in these two early works, in\r\nwhich he responded to a political movement by an artistic endeavour,\r\ndoes he seem, in a certain sense, individual and powerful. All the\r\nothers are stereotyped productions which, having nothing to do with the\r\nBelgian national movement, have all the more to do with the Parisian\r\n_École du bon sens_. Even his \"Christ in the Grave,\" painted in 1833,\r\nand now in St. Michael's Church at Louvain, with its artificial grace\r\nand pietistical sentimentality, might have been painted by Ary Scheffer.\r\nThe pathetic scenes from English and French history of the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries which followed this merely reflect that painting\r\nof historical anecdote which was invented by Delaroche. Agnes Sorel and\r\nCharles VII, Abelard and Eloise, Charles I taking leave of his children,\r\nAnne Bullen's parting from Elizabeth, Peter the Great presenting to his\r\nministers the model of a Dutch ship, Columbus in prison, Boccaccio\r\nreading the _Decameron_ to Joanna of Naples, the brothers De Witt before\r\ntheir execution, André Chénier in the prison of Saint-Lazare, Louis XVII\r\nat Simon the shoe-maker's, the poet Camoens as a beggar, Charles I going\r\nto the scaffold--all are subjects treated by others before him in\r\nFrance, and neither in their conception nor their technique have they\r\nanything original. In the last-mentioned picture, exhibited in Antwerp\r\nin 1870, he attained the limit of sugary affectation: a young girl has\r\nsunk on her knees, and, with dreamily uplifted eyes, offers to the\r\nStuart King who is going to his death--a rose! Wappers is merely a\r\nreflex of French Romanticism, although he cannot be brought into direct\r\ncomparison with any Parisian master. The passion of Delacroix stirred\r\nhim but little: nothing points to a relationship between him and that\r\ngreat spirit. One is rather reminded of Alfred Johannot, whom he\r\nresembles in his entire gamut of emotion as in his treatment and\r\nselection of subjects. In both may be found elegance of line, Byronic\r\nemphasis, histrionic gestures, and the same stage properties borrowed\r\nfrom the theatre; never the genuine movement of feeling, only empty and\r\ndistorted grimaces.\r\n\r\nOf the others who appeared with him the same may be said. All Belgian\r\nmatadors of the forties and fifties came to grief, and are interesting\r\nin the history of art only as symptomatic phenomena, as members of that\r\nschool of Delaroche which encompassed the world. They abandoned the\r\nantique marble, the chlamys, and the leaden forms of the Classicists, to\r\nset in their place a motley picture of the Middle Ages, made up of\r\ncuirasses, mail-shirts, fleshings, and velvet and silken doublets. One\r\nconvention followed the other, and pedantic dryness was replaced by\r\nmelancholy sentimentalism. As skilled practitioners they understood the\r\nsleights of their art, but never rose to individual creation. Amongst\r\nmany painters there was not a single artist.\r\n\r\nAs regards _De Keyzer_, it seems as if throughout his whole life he had\r\nwished to remain true to the memory of his benefactress: a simpering\r\nfeminine trait runs with enervating sweetness through all his works,\r\neven through that \"Battle of the Spurs\" which founded his reputation.\r\nAccording to old writers, the athletic bodies of the Flemings were the\r\nterror of the French chivalry at Courtrai. De Keyzer has made of them\r\nmere plaster figures, and the pale, meagre colouring is in keeping with\r\nthe languid conception. In the battles of Woeringen, of Senef, and\r\nNieuwpoort, which followed on this picture, and were executed for the\r\nBelgian and Dutch Government, he succeeded still less in overcoming his\r\naffectation; and he first found the fitting province for his mild and\r\ncorrect talent when in later years he began to render little anecdotes\r\nof the Emperor Maximilian or Justus Lipsius out of the studio of Rubens\r\nor Memlinc. For these there was need of little but a certain superficial\r\nplay of colour and an elegant painting of textures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bruyllant, Brussels._\r\n\r\n  SLINGENEYER.   THE AVENGER.]\r\n\r\n_Ernest Slingeneyer_ is stronger and more masculine. Yet what an\r\nunrefreshing chaos of blue, red, saffron, and citron-yellow is that\r\n\"Sea-fight at Lepanto\"! Slingeneyer felt that the _chiaroscuro_ with\r\nwhich Wappers saturated his \"Episode\" was not in keeping with this\r\naction under open sky. But rightly as he felt this, he had not the\r\nstrength to solve the problem of open-air painting. What a barbaric\r\neffect these red, brown, and yellow bodies make in their motley\r\ntheatrical pomp! How the composition of the picture savours of\r\napotheosis! As for his later work, his thirteen gigantic pictures,\r\n\"_gloires de la Belgique_,\" in the great hall of the Brussels Academy,\r\nlike De Keyzer's mural paintings above the staircase of the Antwerp\r\nMuseum, they would never have been painted had they not had Delaroche's\r\nhemicycle as their forerunner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bruyllant, Brussels._\r\n\r\n  LOUIS GALLAIT.]\r\n\r\nAnd _Gallait's_ \"Abdication of Charles V\"--one fails to understand how\r\nit was possible that so much able disquisition was suggested by this\r\npicture. How slight a smattering of the erudition of a stage manager is\r\nnecessary for the representation of such a scene: the throne on one\r\nside; before it the lords and gentlemen in a semicircle, to the left\r\nfront the ladies to make a fine effect for the eye, and in the\r\nbackground balconies with curious spectators, to widen out the\r\nspectacle. It is all pure theatre; an icy ceremony with prettily got up\r\nsupernumeraries. All the heads have the discreditable appearance of\r\nfamily portraits painted after death, and then washed over with a faint\r\nconventional tinge of red. The whole thing is like a huge piece of\r\nstill-life, which an adroit painter has put together out of a mixture of\r\nheads, gold, jewels, mantles, and perukes. Delaroche seems to have\r\ncontributed the composition, Devéria the sumptuous costumery; and as for\r\nthe colouring, Isabey, with his sunbeams shimmering in gold and silver,\r\nmay not improbably have had something to do with that. What was\r\nspontaneous in Wappers is replaced in Gallait by cold calculation. Once\r\nand once only did this correct and frigid painter give evidence of a\r\ncertain dramatic vein; it was when in 1851 he painted \"The Brussels\r\nGuild of Marksmen paying the Last Honours to Egmont and Horn.\" With a\r\nbrutal audacity the decapitated heads are set to their bodies. Bloodless\r\nand livid, with clotted and tangled beards, they both really look as if\r\nthey had been studied direct from nature. But the rest of the picture,\r\nthe surrounding of theatrical attractions, parade costumes, and false\r\npathos, is all the less in keeping with this study of death. How\r\nZurbaran or Caravaggio would have treated the theme! They would have\r\nveiled the unessential figures in darkness, and irradiated the heads\r\nonly with a trenchant light. What Gallait has made of it is the final\r\ntableau of an opera of costume. The two sergeants of Alva who are on\r\nguard, and the men who are showing their reverence, tread the stage like\r\nbad actors, scrupulously arrayed and making pathetic gestures. Their\r\naction has been studied from drawing-school copies; no genuine cry of\r\npassion ever breaks through. Heads, hands, and outlines have all a\r\nsickly idealism; a studious and sedulously polished manner of painting\r\nhas ruined the intrinsic spirit of the work as a whole. Théophile\r\nGautier was right when he wrote of Gallait: \"_Tout le talent_ _qu'on\r\npeut acquérir avec du travail, du goût, du jugememt, et de la volonté,\r\nM. Gallait le possède._\" Gallait's \"Last Obsequies,\" hung in that same\r\nSalon of 1850 which contained Courbet's \"Stone-breakers,\" and the words\r\nof recognition accorded to it, were the last obsequies given to the\r\nparting genius of historical painting. A few years went by, and\r\nGallait's fame died away. After 1851 he painted fourteen other great\r\nhistorical pictures (\"Egmont's Last Moments,\" \"Johanna the Mad by the\r\nCorpse of her Husband,\" \"Alva at the Window during the Execution of the\r\ntwo Counts,\" etc.), and, occasionally, sentimental _genre_ pictures,\r\nsuch as \"The Oblivion of Sorrow\" in the Berlin National Gallery; in this\r\na small boy is playing the fiddle for the consolation of his sister, who\r\nhad sunk upon the high-road exhausted by hunger. He also painted many\r\nportraits. But nothing gave him a niche in the memory of his\r\ncontemporaries. \"The Pest at Tournai,\" painted in 1882, was a work\r\nextremely creditable to his old age; it was nevertheless a picture which\r\nappeared to another generation merely as a phantom; and when, on 20th\r\nNovember 1887, the announcement of his death passed through the land, it\r\ncame unexpectedly, like that of a person already believed to have been\r\nlong dead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bruyllant, Brussels._\r\n\r\n  GALLAIT.   EGMONT'S LAST MOMENTS.]\r\n\r\nFinally, _Edouard de Bièfve_, who in 1842 shared Gallait's triumph in\r\nGermany, and was afterwards named in the same breath with him, is the\r\nman who marks the complete corruption of this tendency. If the sturdy\r\nWappers, the emasculate De Keyzer, and the eclectic Gallait tricked out\r\ntheir pathetic heroes with noble heads like that of the Antinous, and\r\noffered their contemporaries an adroit theatrical art, a parade, and a\r\nhollow pathos, the incapable Bièfve never got beyond the painting of\r\n_tableaux vivants_ laboriously presented. Terrible and of Shakespearian\r\nimpressiveness is the scene in which the half-famished Ugolino hurls\r\nhimself upon his son in an appalling ecstasy of frenzy, a curse against\r\nGod and man upon his lips. Upon the canvas, six metres wide, which\r\nBièfve in 1836 devoted to this theme, there is represented an old\r\ngentleman, who, though certainly a little pale, contrives to maintain in\r\nperfection the punctilious bearing of a cavalier, and in the midst of\r\nhis fasting cure has picturesquely draped round his shoulders an ermine\r\nmantle, as if he had been asked out to dinner. Before him stands a young\r\nman, possessing that graceful outline beloved of Paul Delaroche.\r\nDevéria, Ary Scheffer, and Johannot were better painters of such\r\nmonumental illustrations of the classics. As yet the shivering art of\r\nBelgium had learnt only to warm itself at the Parisian fireside. Even\r\nBièfve's \"League of the Nobles of the Netherlands,\" despite its national\r\nsubject-matter, was no more than a lucky hit, which he owed to his long\r\nresidence in Paris. And how tiresomely is the scene played out! One\r\nwould wish to catch the mutterings of insurrection from these men who\r\npersonify the Belgian people; but Bièfve's picture is restful and\r\ndignified. Egmont and Horn, the lions of the occasion, are conducting\r\nthemselves like honest citizens who are bored at a party. Seated in his\r\nchair, the handsome Egmont thinks merely of showing his fine profile to\r\nthe ladies in the gallery, and Horn, who steps towards the table to make\r\nhis signature, does it with the elegance of a lover inscribing verses in\r\na young lady's album. Three brothers with clasped hands swear the\r\nwell-known oath to die together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bruyllant, Brussels._\r\n\r\n  EDOUARD BIÈFVE.]\r\n\r\nIt is a little irony in the history of art that in 1842 these two same\r\npictures set all Germany in tumult, and diverted the whole stream of\r\npainting into a new course. But how was it possible that the German\r\npainters stood before them as if struck by lightning? It must be\r\nremembered that for a whole generation Germany had seen nothing but\r\ncoloured cartoons, and that the enthusiasm for Franco-Belgian art had\r\nbeen so prepared that the least touch was enough to set it in flames.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bruyllant, Brussels._\r\n\r\n  BIÈFVE.   THE LEAGUE OF THE NOBLES OF THE NETHERLANDS.]\r\n\r\nSince the wars of liberation Germany had been very reserved in her\r\nattitude towards the French. Until the year 1842 original works of the\r\nFrench and Belgian school had never been hung in any German exhibition.\r\nBut in spite of this, a high, even enthusiastic, appreciation of French\r\nand Belgian painting was being spread, especially amongst the younger\r\ngeneration. Even in engravings and lithographs after French pictures it\r\nwas believed that qualities of colour were discoverable which were\r\nwanting in German painting. Heine and other authors, who had wandered to\r\nParis, \"the lofty tower of Freedom,\" to escape from the depressing\r\ncondition of German affairs, had done what in them lay for the\r\ndissemination of this cult. The rising generation of the forties had\r\nbeen driven by Heine's notices of the Salon into an almost hostile\r\nattitude towards the dominant art schools of Germany, the schools of\r\nDüsseldorf and Munich. The stylists on the Isar and the sentimental\r\nelegiac painters on the Rhine met with the same antipathy from the\r\nyounger generation. The appearance of the two Belgian historical\r\npictures, which were really nothing more than offshoots of the great\r\nFrench school, gave nourishment of doubled strength to this tendency to\r\nseek salvation in Paris. The German painters were startled out of\r\ncontentment with their beloved cartoons, and to many a man it seemed as\r\nif the scales had fallen from his eyes. They perceived what an admirable\r\nthing it is that a painter should be able to paint. What they could have\r\nlearnt long before from any good old picture, and in their turbulent\r\nenthusiasm for ideas had not learnt, was made suddenly clear to them by\r\nthese new paintings. They came to the conclusion that it was impossible\r\nfor God Almighty to have poured light and colour over the objective\r\nworld with the intention that painters should transform it into a world\r\nof shadowless contours. They recognised that the style of cartoon work\r\nhad led away from all painting, and that it was therefore necessary to\r\ndo honour once more to the despised handiwork and technique of art, as\r\nthe fundamental condition of its well-being. However much the æsthetic\r\nparty might warn them not to renounce \"the Reformation of painting,\r\nwhich had been begun and perfected forty years before,\" and not \"with\r\nmodern technique to sink back into the pre-Cornelian, ornamental model\r\npainting,\" the demand for colour, which had been so long neglected,\r\nasserted its rights more and more loudly. King Ludwig's saying was\r\nrepeated as though it were a new revelation: \"The painter must be able\r\nto paint.\" Colour was the battle-cry of the day, the battle-cry of\r\nyouth, to whom the world belongs. In place of the ideal of contour came\r\nthe ideal of hue and pigment. Cartoons, in the sense of the old cartoon\r\nschool, no one would draw any longer. To paint pictures, finished\r\npictures, was the tendency of the day. And since painting is to be\r\nlearnt from the living only, and such as could paint lived in Germany no\r\nlonger, they packed their trunks, and set out to learn from the\r\n\"go-ahead neighbour.\" As Rome had been hitherto, so was Paris now, the\r\nhigh school of German art. \"To Paris!\" and \"Painting!\" were the cries\r\nthroughout all Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION OF THE GERMAN COLOURISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 1842 dates the pilgrimage of the German artists to Paris, Antwerp,\r\nand Brussels. In Delaroche, Cogniet, and Couture, in Wappers and\r\nGallait, they believed they could discover the secrets of art which were\r\nhidden from German teachers. The history of art can scarcely offer\r\nanother example of such a sudden overthrow of dogmas hitherto dominant\r\nby dogmas directly opposed to them. During the first half of the century\r\nthe painters of Germany were pious men, humorous, witty, and intelligent\r\nmen; they had a sharply cut profile, and so enchained the multitude by\r\ntheir human qualities that nobody remarked how little they understood of\r\ntheir craft, or that they were too superior to learn to draw correctly,\r\nheld colour unchaste, and made virtues of all their failings. The next\r\ngeneration was condemned to learn painting during the whole of its\r\nnatural life. The former were \"problematic natures\": beings who united\r\nwith a Titanic force of will an actual achievement which is hardly worth\r\nmentioning; who regarded the mere handicraft of art as beneath their\r\ndignity; who, in their revelations to mankind, were resolved to burden\r\ntheir spirit as little as possible with any sensuous expression of their\r\ngenius, and, above all, meant not to degrade themselves by the manual\r\nlabour of learning to paint, and thereby wasting their valuable time.\r\nThe latter were not ashamed of painting. By devoting themselves with\r\nvehemence to the colouring and technique of oil-painting, they\r\naccomplished the necessary revolution against the abstract idealism of\r\nthe school of Cornelius. In their opulence of ideas the draughtsmen of\r\ncartoons had made a notch in the history of art by casting the technical\r\ntradition overboard. To have reinstated this as far as they could, with\r\nthe aid of the French, is the peculiar merit of the generation of 1850.\r\n\"_Règle générale: si vous rencontrez un bon peintre allemamd, vous\r\npouvez le complimenter en français._\" So runs the motto--not\r\ncomplimentary to Germany, but quite unassailable--which Edmond About\r\nprefixed to his notices on the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1855.\r\n\r\n_Anselm Feuerbach_ was the first distinguished German artist who made\r\nthe journey to Paris with a proper knowledge of the necessity of this\r\nstep. In Germany he was the greatest representative of that Classicism\r\nof which the principal master in France was Ingres, and the continuator\r\nThomas Couture. And he succeeded in accomplishing that which the German\r\nClassicists of the beginning of the century strove after in vain. Whilst\r\nthey contented themselves with suggestions and an indeterminate\r\nsymbolisation of poetical ideas after the Greek writers, German\r\nClassicism achieved in Feuerbach's \"Symposium of Plato\" a great, noble,\r\nand faultless work, which will live. He moved upon classic ground more\r\nnaturally and freely and with more of the Hellenic spirit than even the\r\nFrench. For the classic genius was begotten in him, and not inoculated\r\nfrom without. In the _Vermächtniss_ the son calls his father's book the\r\nprophetic seal of his own original being. He inherited the classic\r\nspirit from the enthusiastic scholar, the subtile author of the Vatican\r\nApollo, to whom the genius of Greece had so fully and completely\r\nrevealed itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstängl._\r\n\r\n  ANSELM FEUERBACH.   PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF.]\r\n\r\nA remarkable nature: philologer and dreamer, German and Greek, one who\r\nrejoiced in beauty and in the life of the senses, and whose proud muse\r\nstrayed through life solitary and with leaden weights upon her\r\nfeet,--such was Anselm Feuerbach, and by that division of his being he\r\nwas ruined. Equipped with a superior education, an appearance of\r\nsingular nobility, and with proud family traditions, he emerged like a\r\nshining meteor in Düsseldorf, when he began his career at the age of\r\nsixteen, brilliant, precocious, and already a favourite amongst women.\r\nThis was in 1845. He ran through all the schools in Germany, Belgium,\r\nand France. In regard to the living, he believed himself to be indebted\r\nto the French alone, and eagerly claimed the merit of having been the\r\nfirst to seek them out. But it was in Italy that he had passed through\r\nhis novitiate as an artist. A glorious hour it must have been when\r\nFeuerbach, full-blooded and dedicated to the worship of beauty, entered\r\nVenice in 1855, in company with that cheerful and convivial poet Victor\r\nScheffel. In the town of the lagoons, whither he had come on a\r\ncommission from the Court of Karlsruhe to copy the Assumption of Titian,\r\nFeuerbach made the second determining step of his life. The third he\r\nmade when his stipendium was withdrawn, and, full of youthful\r\nconfidence in his luck and his good star, he undertook his journey to\r\nRome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Albert, Munich._\r\n\r\n  FEUERBACH.   HAFIZ AT THE WELL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Albert, Munich._\r\n\r\n  FEUERBACH.   PIETA.]\r\n\r\nHe was handsome, small, and refined, and rather pale and spare--of that\r\ndelicacy which in highly bred families is found in the last heirs with\r\nwhom the race dies out--and he had dark locks which clustered wildly\r\nround his head. The moulding of his features was feminine, and his\r\ncomplexion southern; his eyes, shadowed by long lashes, were brown,\r\nsometimes fiery, sometimes sad and earnest, and his glance was swift. He\r\nloved to sing Italian songs to the guitar in his fine, deep voice, and\r\nBoecklin and Reinhold Begas would join in.\r\n\r\nThe impressions he received in Italy were formative of his life. For he\r\nlearnt to understand the divine simplicity and noble dignity of antique\r\nart better than Couture was capable of understanding them; and he\r\nachieved a simple amplitude to which the French Classicism had never\r\nrisen.\r\n\r\nFrom his first works, to which the Düsseldorf egg-shell is still\r\nsticking, down to the \"Symposium of Plato\"--what a route it is, and\r\nthrough what phases he passes. \"Hafiz at the Well,\" surrounded by\r\nvoluptuous, half-naked girls, painted at Paris in 1852, was his first\r\neminent achievement. In subject it is a late fruit from Daumer's study\r\nof Hafiz: as a work of art it is one of the most genuine products of the\r\nschool of Couture. No other German artist has surrendered himself so\r\nentirely to the French. With a large brush, never losing sight of the\r\ncomplete effect, Feuerbach has painted his canvas, almost for the sake\r\nof showing that he has assimilated everything that was to be learnt in\r\nParis. The same influence preponderates in the \"Death of Pietro\r\nAretino,\" done in 1854. But, side by side with the Parisian master, the\r\nlater Venetians have an unmistakable share in this work. The capacity\r\nto grasp things in a monumental largeness is already announced.\r\nEvidently Feuerbach has studied Paul Veronese, and realised how high he\r\nstands above the French painters. At the same time he has examined the\r\nother Venetians for their technique, and discovered something which has\r\nappealed to him in Bordone's colouring. But \"Dante walking with\r\nhigh-born Ladies of Ravenna,\" finished at Rome in 1857, was the ripest\r\nfruit of his Venetian impressions. In sunny warmth of colour, fine\r\ngolden tone, and quiet simplicity of pictorial treatment, no modern has\r\ncome so near to Palma and Bordone. And in \"Dante's Death,\" of 1858,\r\nthere predominates a still greater depth and golden glow, a grave and\r\ndevout beauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  FEUERBACH.   IPHIGENIA.]\r\n\r\nIn the following works, however, Feuerbach, with a conscious purpose,\r\ndenies himself the quality to which the Dante pictures owe a principal\r\npart of their powerful effect: the mild glow, the sunny beaming of\r\ncolour. He confines himself to a cool scheme of tone, reduced to grey,\r\nalmost to the point of colourlessness; to a glimmer of leaden blue, a\r\nmoonlight pallor. At the same time he has concentrated the whole life of\r\nhis figures in their inward being, whilst every movement has been taken\r\nfrom their limbs. Even the expression of spiritual emotion in the eyes\r\nand features has been subdued in the extreme. The \"Pietà,\" both the\r\n\"Iphigenias,\" and the \"Symposium of Plato\" are the world-renowned\r\nproofs of the height of classic inspiration which he touched in Italy.\r\nMeasure, nobility, unsought and perfected loftiness characterise the\r\n\"Pietà,\" that mother of the Saviour who bows herself in silent agony\r\nover the body of her Divine Son, and those three kneeling women, whose\r\nsilent grief is of such thrilling power, precisely because of its\r\nemotionlessness. For \"Iphigenia\" Feuerbach has given of his best. She is\r\nin both examples--the first of 1862, the second of 1871--a figure\r\nsublime beyond human measure, grand like the figure of the Greek\r\ntragedy. But the \"Symposium of Plato\" will always assert its high value\r\nas one of the finest pictorial creations of an imagination nourished on\r\nthe great art of the ancients, and filled brimful with the splendour of\r\nthe antique world. There is nothing in it superfluous, nothing\r\naccidental. The noblest simplicity of speech, a Greek rhythm in all\r\ngradations, the beautiful lines of bas-relief, decisive colour and\r\nstringent form--that is the groundwork of Feuerbach's art. And through\r\nit there speaks a spirit preoccupied with greatness and heroism. Thus he\r\ncreated his \"Medea\" in the Munich Pinakothek, that picture of\r\nmagnificent, sombre melancholy that affects one like a monologue from a\r\nSophoclean tragedy. Thus he painted his \"Battle of the Amazons,\" one of\r\nthe few \"nude\" pictures of the century which possesses the perfectly\r\nunconcerned and unsexual nudity of the antique. Italy had set him free\r\nfrom all the insincere and calculated methods which had deformed French\r\nart since Delaroche; it had set him free from all theatrical sentiment,\r\nby which he had accustomed himself to understand everything that was\r\nforced in costume, pigment, pose and movement, light and scenery. In the\r\nplace of the ordinary treatment from the model, with its set gestures\r\nand grimaces, he gave an expression of form which was great, simple, and\r\nplastic. His study seems to have been an incessant exercise of the eye,\r\nto see and to hold fast to the essential, to the great lines of nature\r\nas of the human body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Albert, Munich._\r\n\r\n  FEUERBACH.   PORTRAIT OF A ROMAN LADY.]\r\n\r\nIn the full possession of these powers, which he acquired amid the\r\nelementary simplicity and heroic majesty of Roman landscape by constant\r\nintercourse with the great painters of the past, he determined in the\r\nsummer of 1873 to accept an invitation from the Vienna Academy. His\r\nfriends rejoiced. At last this worker, who had been abandoned in a\r\nforeign land, seemed to have found in his native country a place which\r\noffered him a new life. He was but little more than forty: yet all was\r\nso soon to be over. From Rome he came to the restless capital which had\r\njust lived through the birththroes of a new epoch; from the side of\r\nMichael Angelo to the side of Makart! The sketches for a series on the\r\nwars of the Titans, which he began after his arrival, promised the\r\ngreatest things. They display a sureness and majesty which find no\r\nparallel in the German art of those years. But they were destined never\r\nto be completed.\r\n\r\nFeeling himself, like Antæus, strong only on Roman soil, he lost his\r\npower in Vienna. Reserved, innately delicate, a mystical, ideal nature\r\nlike that of Faust, and one which only with reluctance permitted to a\r\nstranger a glimpse of its inner being; in his life, as in his art,\r\nhigh-bred and simple, hating both as painter and as man everything\r\noverstrained or sentimental; in his judgment harsh, severe, and\r\nuncompromising, lonely and proud, he was but little adapted to make\r\nfriends for himself. The indifference with which his study for the \"Fall\r\nof the Titans\" was received in the Vienna Exhibition wounded him\r\nmortally. Vienna, which is so much disposed to laughter, laughed.\r\nCriticism was rough and unfavourable. He left Vienna and went to Venice.\r\nThe tragical fate of a party of voyagers, drowned as they were playing\r\nand singing together on a night journey to the Lido, gave him the motive\r\nfor his last picture, \"The Concert,\" which was found unfinished after\r\nhis death, and came into the possession of the Berlin National Gallery.\r\nOn 4th January 1882 he died, alone in a Venetian hotel.\r\n\r\n  \"Hier ruht Anselm Feuerbach,\r\n   Der im Leben manches malte,\r\n   Fern vom Vaterlande, ach,\r\n   Das ihn immer schlecht bezahlte.\"\r\n\r\nSo runs the epitaph which he made for himself. And posterity might alter\r\nit into--\r\n\r\n  \"Hier ruht ein deutscher Maler,\r\n   Bekannt im deutschen Land;\r\n   Nennt man die besten Namen,\r\n   Wird auch der seine genannt.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, one must not go too far. In familiar conversation Feuerbach\r\nonce said of himself that when the history of art in the nineteenth\r\ncentury came to be written, mention would be made of him as of a meteor.\r\nSo isolated, and so much out of connection with the artistic striving of\r\nhis contemporaries, did he believe himself to be, that he held himself\r\njustified in saying: \"Believe me, after fifty years my pictures will\r\npossess tongues, and tell the world what I was and what I meant.\" In\r\ntruth, he owes his resurrection less to his pictures than to the\r\n_Vermächtniss_. A book has opened the eyes of Germany to Feuerbach's\r\ngreatness, and since that time the worship of Feuerbach has gone almost\r\ninto extremes. Throughout his lifetime--like almost every great artist\r\nwho has died before old age--he was handled by the Press without much\r\ncomprehension. The critics blamed his grey tones, the connoisseurs\r\ncomplained of his unpatriotic subjects or missed the presence of\r\nanecdote. His admirers were the refined, quiet people who do not praise\r\nat the top of their voices. He never met with recognition, and that\r\npoisoned his life. It is generous of posterity to make up for the want\r\nof contemporary appreciation. But when he is set up as a pioneer, whose\r\nwork pointed out the art of the future, the judgment becomes one which a\r\n_later_ posterity will subscribe to only with hesitation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FEUERBACH.   MOTHER'S JOY.]\r\n\r\nFeuerbach presents a problem for psychological rather than artistic\r\nanalysis. Whoever has read the _Vermächtniss_ feels the personal element\r\nin these works, sees in them the confessions of a proud, unsatisfied,\r\nand suffering soul, and in their author no son of the Renaissance born\r\nout of due season, but a modern who has been agitated through and\r\nthrough by the _décadent_ fever. In his book Feuerbach appears as one of\r\nthe first who felt to his inmost fibre all the intellectual and\r\nspiritual contradictions which are bred by the nineteenth century, and\r\nwho cherished them even with a sort of tenderness, as contributing to a\r\nhigh and more subtilised condition of soul. He was one of the first who,\r\nin the same way as Bourget and Verlaine, studied moral pathology under\r\nthe microscope, and who, with a tired soul and worn-out feelings, sought\r\nfor the last refinement of simplicity. And this weary resignations seems\r\nalso to speak from his pictures. Not one of the old painters has this\r\nmodern melancholy, this air of dejection which hovers over his works.\r\nEven the ladies round Dante are filled with that sadness which comes\r\nover youth on the evenings of sultry summer days, when it is struck by a\r\npresentiment of the transitoriness of earthly things. It is as if these\r\nfigures would all some day or other vanish into the cloister, or, like\r\nIphigenia, sit lonely upon the shore of a sea, whither no ship should\r\never come to release them. And it is certainly not by chance that\r\nIphigenia had such a hold upon the artist; he repeatedly set himself to\r\nrender her figure afresh, and, later, Medea steps beside her as the\r\nimpersonation of the still more intense sense of desertion which filled\r\nthe artist's spirit. The woman of Colchis, who sits shivering on the\r\nshore of the sea, chilled through and through by the consciousness of\r\nher abandonment; the daughter of Agamemnon, who in spirit is seeking the\r\nland of the Greeks, with the boundless sea spreading wide and grey\r\nbefore her, like her own yearning,--both are images of the lonely\r\nFeuerbach, who, like Hölderlin, the Werther of Greece, flies to a dreamy\r\nHellas as to a happy shore, to find peace for his sick spirit. His\r\n\"Symposium of Plato\" has not that exuberant sensuousness, that mixture\r\nof _esprit_ and voluptuousness, of temperance and intemperance, which\r\nmarks the Athenian life under Pericles; nor has it the Olympian\r\nblitheness with which Raphael would have executed the subject. A breath\r\nof monkish asceticism is over every joy, subduing it. These Greeks have\r\ntasted of the pains which Christianity brought into the world. Or take\r\nhis \"Judgment of Paris\" in Hamburg. Nude women life-size, Loves,\r\nsouthern landscape, gay raiment, golden vessels, brilliant ornament,\r\nbeauty--those are the elements of the picture; and how little have such\r\nwords the power to render the impression! But Feuerbach's three\r\ngoddesses have an uneasiness, as if each one of them knew beforehand\r\nthat she would not receive the apple; Paris is sitting just as\r\ncheerlessly there. And by borrowing his loves from Boucher, Feuerbach\r\nhas shown the more sharply the opposition between the Hellenic legend\r\nwhich he interprets and the funereal mien with which he does it. The\r\nblitheness of the antique spirit is tempered by the sadness of the\r\nmodern mind. He tells these old myths as never a Greek and never a\r\nmaster of the Renaissance would have told them. Olympus is filled with\r\nmist, with the colouring of the North, with the melancholy of a later\r\nand more neurotic age, the moods of which are for that very reason more\r\nrich in _nuances_--an age which is at once graver and more disturbed by\r\nproblems than was the old Hellas. Feuerbach's pictures are octaves in\r\nthe language of Tasso, but of a repining lyrical mood which Tasso would\r\nnot have given them. The brightest sunshine laughed over the Greece of\r\nthe Renaissance; over that of Feuerbach there rests a rainy, overcast\r\nNovember mood. Even works of his like the \"Children on the Sea-shore\"\r\nand the \"Idyll\" reveal a pained and suffering conception of nature, that\r\ntender and subdued spirit that Burne-Jones has; it is as if these\r\nblossoms of humanity were there to waste away in buds that never come to\r\nfruition, as if it were no longer possible to breathe into creation the\r\ntrue joyousness of youth. Even the five girls, making music out of\r\ndoors, in the picture \"In Spring,\" look like young widows, putting the\r\nwhole tenderness of their souls into elegiac complaints for their lost\r\nhusbands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstängl._\r\n\r\n  FEUERBACH.   MEDEA.]\r\n\r\nTo this resigned and mournful expression must be added the uncomfortable\r\nmotionlessness of his figures. They do not speak, and do not laugh, and\r\ndo not cry; they know no passions and sorrows which express themselves\r\nby the straining of the limbs. Everything bears the impress of sublime\r\npeace, of that same peace by which the works of Gustave Moreau, Puvis de\r\nChavannes, and Burne-Jones are to be distinguished from the ecstatic and\r\nsentimental tirades of the Romanticists. In Feuerbach's works this is\r\nthe stamp of his own nature. The antique beauty becomes shrouded in a\r\nmysterious veil; and life is illuminated as by a mournful light, which\r\nrests over bygone worlds. What heart-rending keenness is often in the\r\neffect of the melancholy tinge of these subdued bluish tones! That\r\ncolour is the genuine expression of the temperament reveals itself\r\nclearly enough in Feuerbach. When he began his career, his head full of\r\nideals and his heart full of hopes, his pictures exulted in a Venetian\r\nsplendour, in full and luxuriant golden harmonies; as \"joy after joy\r\nwas shipwrecked in the stream of time\" they became leaden, sullen, and\r\ncorpse-like. As Frans Hals in his last days, when his fellow-creatures\r\nallowed him only the bare necessities of life, accorded to the figures\r\nin his pictures only so much colour as would give them the appearance of\r\nliving human beings; as Rembrandt's magical golden tone changed in the\r\nsad days of his bankruptcy into a sullen, monotonous brown, so a deep\r\nsadness broods over the pictures of Feuerbach,--something that savours\r\nof memory and remorse, the mournful atmosphere and dark mood of evening\r\nwhich the bat loves. Even as a colourist he has the melancholy lassitude\r\nof the end of the century.\r\n\r\nThat is what distinguishes him from his contemporaries. The other\r\nidealists of those years painted their pictures without hesitation and\r\nwith the facility of a professor of calligraphy; they remembered,\r\narranged their reminiscences, and rubbed their hands with\r\nself-complacency when they came near their model. They did not yet feel\r\nthe throb of the nineteenth century, and impersonality was their note.\r\nFeuerbach, the neurotic brooder, was a personality. After a long\r\nmortification, the human spirit, the living, suffering, human spirit,\r\ncelebrated its renaissance in his works. Under its influence the jejune\r\npainting of prettiness practised by others was changed to modern\r\npessimism and sorrowful resignation. The more he gave way to these moods\r\nthe more modern he became, the more he was Feuerbach and the further he\r\ndeparted from the works of art which were regarded by his contemporaries\r\nand himself as eternal exemplars. He has been reproached with oddities\r\nand strange eccentricities. The critics reminded him how far he departed\r\nfrom the lines of his models; indignantly they asked him why he, the\r\npale, delicate, sick, neurotic, and overstrained man, the uncertain,\r\nfaltering, and tortured spirit, did not paint like the blithe,\r\nimprovising Raphael, like the jubilant and convivial Veronese, like the\r\nsensuous, exuberant Rubens. And Feuerbach himself becomes perplexed.\r\nLike Gros in France, he is conscious both of his strength and his\r\nweakness. He does not stand sovereign above the old painters, like\r\nBoecklin and those other idealists of the present. He runs through life\r\nin ever fresh astonishment at the novelty which is revealed to him in\r\nthe works of earlier centuries. The nerves of this latter day vibrate,\r\nthe blood of the nineteenth century throbs in him--yet he has the wish\r\nto imitate. The history of every one of his works is a fight, a\r\ndesperate struggle, between the individuality of the artist, his own\r\ninward feeling, and the \"absolute Beauty\" which hovered beyond him cold\r\nand unpliable.\r\n\r\nIn his first drawings he begins boldly; one knows his hand and says:\r\n\"Only Feuerbach can have done that.\" And then one is able to trace, step\r\nby step, and from sketch to sketch, what pains he takes that the\r\nfinished picture may be as little of a Feuerbach as possible. The\r\npersonal and individual element in the drawings is lost, what is\r\nFeuerbachian in the composition, the personal contribution of the\r\nartist, is effaced, and finally there is produced in the picture the\r\nmarvellous look of having been painted by a genuine old Venetian as a\r\nghost. And Feuerbach felt the dissonance. He feels that he fully\r\nexpresses himself no more, and also that he does not reach the level of\r\nthe old masters. He adds borrowed, conventional figure, like the Boucher\r\nCupids in the \"Judgment of Paris\"--figures against which every fibre of\r\nhis being revolts--just to arrive at an outward resemblance to the old\r\npictures, an impression of exultation and joyousness and the spirit of\r\nthe Renaissance. And when he stands opposite his work he seems to\r\nhimself like a gravedigger in a harlequin's jacket. He scrutinises\r\nhimself in despair, and one day comes to feel that his power of\r\nproduction is exhausted. Splendid and unapproachable, from the walls of\r\nthe galleries, the art of the classic masters stares him in the face;\r\nand he enters into a dramatic life-and-death struggle with it. He will\r\nnot be Feuerbach, and cannot become a Classic. The curtain falls and the\r\ntragedy is over. Such destinies have been before in the world, no doubt;\r\nbut in our time they have multiplied, and seem so much the sadder\r\nbecause they never come to the average man, but only to great and\r\npeculiarly gifted natures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Albert, Munich._\r\n\r\n  FEUERBACH.   DANTE WALKING WITH HIGH-BORN LADIES OF RAVENNA.]\r\n\r\nThese matters--a silent historical sermon--one reads, with the help of\r\nthe _Vermächtniss_, out of Feuerbach's works. There \"his pictures\r\npossess tongues\"; there comes out of them a sound like the cry of a\r\nhuman heart; the whole tragedy of his career becomes present--what he\r\nsucceeded in doing and what remained unapproachable. Yet later\r\ngenerations, which will judge him no longer psychologically, but only as\r\nan artist, generations with which he no longer stands in touch through\r\nhis ethical greatness, will they also feel this in the presence of his\r\nfinished pictures? To them will he be pioneer or imitator, forerunner or\r\ncontinuator? Will he take his place by Boecklin and Watts, or by Couture\r\nand Ingres? It is perhaps a happy chance that in the history of art one\r\nsometimes stumbles upon personalities that mock at all chemical\r\nanalysis. Feuerbach, at any rate, is a great figure in the German art of\r\nthese years. His is a high-bred, aristocratic art, free from any\r\nillustrative undertone, and from loud and motley colour. It is true that\r\nhis figures also pose, but never clumsily or without expression, never\r\ntheatrically. At a time when declamation was universal he did not\r\ndeclaim, at least he never did so with a forced pathos; and it is\r\nprincipally this which gives him a very high and special place amongst\r\nthe German painters of the transitional period. He is always simple,\r\ngrave, majestic. Everything that he does has style, and that makes him\r\nso peculiar in an art which is so often petty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENNEBERG.   THE RACE FOR FORTUNE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Berlin Photographic Co., the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\nBut a different judgment is formed when one compares him with the French\r\nand the old masters. A meteor Feuerbach was not; for he stood on the\r\nground of the Couture school, and raised himself later to yet greater\r\nsimplicity, going back to purer sources, to the Venetians and the\r\nRomans. He is more austere and manly than Couture, but he is, as he\r\nstands in his finished pictures, a Roman of the Cinquecento, who has\r\nbeen in Venice; not an original genius of the nineteenth century, like\r\nBoecklin. Boecklin paints the antique figures in their eternal fulness\r\nand youth; but he is quite modern in sentiment and in his highly\r\ndeveloped technique. Feuerbach in regard to technique stands now on\r\nFrench soil, now on Venetian or Roman; and in his sentiment he is an\r\nimitator of the Cinquecentists, or, if you will, a phenomenon of\r\natavism. His writings and drawings show him concerned with the present,\r\nhis paintings with the past. The modern temperament, artistically\r\nrestrained, breaks out no more, the nerves have no rôle, no human sound\r\nis forced from his figures. He learnt through the spectacles of the\r\ngreat old masters to look away from everything petty in life, but he\r\nnever laid those spectacles down. This modern man, who was so neurotic\r\nas a writer, sought as a painter, for the sake of the ideal, to have no\r\nnerves at all. Before many of his pictures one wishes for a fire; they\r\nmake an effect so cold that one shivers. The quality in them which calls\r\nfor boundless admiration is his splendid artistic earnestness. There\r\nspeaks out of them a sacred peace. Yet, when he is set up as a pioneer,\r\nit must never be forgotten that he is not self-sufficient as, shall we\r\nsay, Millet, but has attained his majesty of conception only in the\r\nleading-strings of masterpieces of a great period, and precisely in the\r\nleading-strings of those masterpieces from the numbing influence of\r\nwhich modern art was forced to set itself free, before it could come to\r\nthe consciousness of itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUSTAV RICHTER.   PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF.]\r\n\r\nTogether with Feuerbach--and having, like him, previously received\r\nenlightenment as to colouring at the Antwerp Academy--_Victor Müller_,\r\nof Frankfort, had gone to Couture in 1849. He resided until 1858 on the\r\nbanks of the Seine, and was especially influenced by Delacroix, and\r\nperhaps also a little affected by Courbet. At least his \"Wood Nymph\"--a\r\nvoluptuous woman lying in a wood--which first made him known in Germany\r\nin 1863, seems but little removed from the healthy realism and exuberant\r\nvigour of the master of Ornans. Otherwise, like Delacroix, he has\r\noccupied himself almost exclusively with Shakespeare. \"Hamlet at the\r\nGrave of Yorick,\" \"Ophelia,\" \"Romeo and Juliet,\" \"Hero and Leander,\"\r\nwere pictures of a deep, sonorous glow of colour; the characters in them\r\nwere seized with great intellectual concentration, and the surrounding\r\nlandscape filled with that sombre poetry of nature which in the hands of\r\nDelacroix so mystically heightens the impression of human tragedies.\r\nVictor Müller was of a bold, uncompromising talent, full of southern\r\nglow and wild Romanticism; a powerful, forcible realist, who never\r\nsought the empty, sentimental, ideal beauty known to his age. In a\r\nperiod dominated almost from end to end by a jejune and rounded beauty,\r\nhe gives pleasure by a healthy, refreshing \"ugliness.\" All the heads in\r\nhis pictures were painted after nature with a religious devoutness;\r\npainted by a man who openly loved the youthful works of Riberas and\r\nCaravaggio. And just as surprising is the power of expression, the deep\r\nand earnest sentiment, which he attained in gestures and physiognomy.\r\nWhile Makart, in his balcony scene from _Romeo and Juliet_, never got\r\naway from a hollow, theatrical affectation, Müller's picture glows\r\nthroughout with a sensuous passion that saps the blood. A new Delacroix\r\nseemed to have been born; an extraordinary talent seemed to be rising\r\nabove the horizon of our art, but Germany had to follow to the grave her\r\ngreatest offshoot of Romanticism before he had spoken a decisive word,\r\njust as she lost Rethel, the greatest son of the cartoon era, in the\r\nflower of his age.\r\n\r\nOf the others who made the pilgrimage to Paris with Feuerbach and\r\nMüller, not one has a similar importance as an artist. Their merit was\r\nthat they made themselves comparatively able masters of technique, and\r\ntaught the new gospel when they returned to Germany. To their\r\nsuperiority in technique and colour, given them by a sound French\r\nschooling, they owed their brilliant success in the fifties. They were,\r\nat the time, the best German painters, and great at a time when ability\r\nwas novel and infrequent. As soon as it became customary and\r\ncommonplace, there remained little to raise them above the average.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RICHTER.   A GIPSY.]\r\n\r\nThat is true of the entire Berlin school of the fifties and sixties. The\r\nmost independent of the many artists who journeyed from the Spree to the\r\nSeine is, probably, _Rudolf Henneberg_, who died young. His technique he\r\nowed to Couture, in whose studio he worked from 1851, and his\r\nsubject-matter to the German classical authors. Born a Brunswicker, he\r\nfelt himself specially attracted by his countryman Bürger, and became a\r\nNorthern ballad painter with French technique. Movement, animation,\r\nwildness, and a certain romantic eeriness, proper to the Northern\r\nballad--these are Henneberg's prominent features, as they are Bürger's.\r\nHis pictures have a bold caprice and a peculiarly powerful and sombre\r\npoetry. The hunting party storm past irresistibly, like a whirlwind, in\r\nhis \"Wild Hunt,\" the illustration to Bürger's ballad, which in 1856 won\r\nhim the gold medal in Paris.\r\n\r\n  \"Und hinterher bei Knall and Klang\r\n   Der Tross mit Hund und Ross und Mann.\"\r\n\r\nA Düsseldorfian Romanticism, from the Wolf's Glen, is united to\r\nCouture's nobleness of colouring in his \"Criminal from Lost Honour,\" of\r\n1860. And a part--even if only a small one--of the spirit which created\r\nDürer's \"The Knight, Death, and the Devil\" lives in his masterpiece \"The\r\nRace for Fortune,\" a picture breathed on by the spirit of sombre,\r\nmediæval Romanticism, which made his name the most honoured in the\r\nExhibition of 1868.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHRADER.   CROMWELL AT WHITEHALL.]\r\n\r\nThe negation of power, an almost feminine painter of no distinctive\r\ncharacter, a new edition of Winterhalter, was _Gustav Richter_. His\r\npopularity is connected with the fisher-boys and odalisques, the\r\nreproduction of which every sempstress at one time used to wear on her\r\nbrooch, while in printed colours they added splendour to all the bonbon\r\nand handkerchief boxes. The accomplished workmanship and sparkling\r\ntreatment of material which he acquired in Paris made him in 1860, after\r\nEduard Magnus had made his exit, the most famous painter of feminine\r\nbeauty. A pleasure-loving man of the world, elegant in appearance, fame,\r\nhonour, and distinction were showered upon him, and he became the\r\nshining spoilt darling of society, the central point of an extensive and\r\nanimated convivial intercourse. His works were carried out in a style\r\nwhich, at that time, had not been learnt in Berlin, and had an air of\r\nCourt life which was held to be exceedingly fashionable. It was later\r\nthat the banal emptiness and insipid taste of his toilette portraits\r\nfirst became obvious, and that their everlastingly sweet and doll-like\r\nsmirk, and their kind and winning eyes, always the same, began to grow\r\ntiresome. In all his life-size chromolithographs there is a distinction\r\nof build and appearance, which in the originals was perhaps to have been\r\ndesired, although the originals unquestionably looked like something\r\nthat was more human and individual. In riper years, after the happiness\r\nof family life had been given him, he executed works which assure his\r\nname a certain endurance; this he did in some of his family\r\nportraits,--for instance, in those of his boys and his wife. To this\r\nlast period belongs the ideal portrait of the Baroness Ziegler as Queen\r\nLouisa, which became such a popular picture in Prussia. But Richter's\r\n\"great\" compositions, which once charmed the visitors at exhibitions,\r\nare now forgotten. In \"Jairus's Daughter\"--admired in 1856 as a fine\r\nperformance in colouring--what strikes one now that its colouring has\r\nlong been surpassed is the inadequacy and theatricality of its\r\ncharacterisation, the outward show, and the banality of this handsome\r\nyoung man who performs his miracle with a declamatory pose. The\r\n\"Building of the Pyramids,\" painted for the Maximilianeum in Munich,\r\nwith its swarming crowd of dark-coloured people, and the royal pair come\r\nto inspect with an endless train, is a gigantic ethnographical\r\npicture-sheet, which did not repay the expenditure of twelve long years\r\nof work.\r\n\r\nIn Paris _Otto Knille_ learnt to approach huge canvas and wall spaces\r\nwith fearlessness, and by executing the many monumental commissions\r\nwhich fell to his share in Prussia, he put this French talent to usury\r\nin a manner which was as blameless as it was uninteresting. Some good\r\npaintings by _Julius Schrader_, such as the historical pictures with\r\nwhich his fame is associated, have remained fresh for a longer period.\r\nThe \"Death of Leonardo da Vinci,\" as well as the \"Surrender of Calais to\r\nEdward III,\" \"Wallenstein and Seni at their Astrological Studies,\" \"The\r\nDying Milton,\" and \"Charles I parting from his Children,\" are only a\r\ncollection of what the Parisian studios had transmitted to him.\r\nDelaroche and the illustrative and theatrical painting of history,\r\nhaving gone the rounds in Belgium, in the next decade demanded their\r\nsacrifice in Germany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  LESSING.   THE HUSSITE SERMON.]\r\n\r\nHere also similar political and literary conditions were prescribed. A\r\nbackward people, uncontent with itself, pined for deeds and glory.\r\nThrough the presentment of the great dramas of the past the spirit of\r\nthe present was to be quickened, as a relaxed body by massage. Here also\r\nthe knowledge of history levelled the ground for painting, as it did in\r\nFrance. While, in the imagination of the Romanticists, different ages\r\nmelted dreamily into each other, and the Hohenstauffen period, because\r\nof its tender melancholy character, gave the keynote for all German\r\nhistory, the scientific writing of history had, since the thirties,\r\nentered as a power into literature. Schlosser began his\r\n_Universal-historische Uebersicht der Geschichte der alten Welt_, which\r\nswelled to nine volumes, and represented with a completeness hitherto\r\nunapproached the civilisation of antiquity. His history of the\r\neighteenth century was a still greater departure, for, after the example\r\nof Voltaire, he included manners, science, and literature in his account\r\nof political events. On the uncompromising subjectivity of Schlosser\r\nfollowed the scientific objectivity of Ranke, who, a master of the\r\ncriticism of sources, delineated with delicate, silver-point portraits\r\nthe Papacy after the Reformation, the French Court, the policy of the\r\nprinces of the age of the Reformation, Cromwell, and the heroes of the\r\nrising power of Prussia. Luden, Giesebrecht, Leo, Hurter, Dahlmann,\r\nGervinus, and many others began their great labours. German painting,\r\nlike French, sought to take advantage of the results of these scientific\r\ninvestigations; and Schnaase was the first who, in the _Kunstblatt_ in\r\n1834, described historical painting as the pressing demand of the age,\r\nand the cultivation of the historical sense in such a disconsolate epoch\r\nas a \"truly religious necessity.\" Soon afterwards Vischer began to\r\npreach historical painting as a new gospel. History, he says, is the\r\nrevelation of God. His Being is revealed in it as much as in the sacred\r\nwritings of religion. Historical painting is therefore the completion\r\nand full exemplification of those principles which, five centuries back,\r\nin Giotto, led to the movement of the new Christian painting. It is\r\ncalled forth by the development of all forms of life and knowledge, and\r\nis the last and highest step which sacred painting is able to reach: it\r\nis the final completion of sacred painting itself. \"Who represents the\r\nHoly Ghost with more dignity? He who paints Him as a dove upon a sheaf\r\nof sunbeams, or he who places before me a great and lofty man, a Luther\r\nor a Huss in the flame of divine enthusiasm?\"\r\n\r\nSomething of the sort had been in the mind of Strauss when he advocated\r\nthe worship of genius as a substitute for religion. The infidel\r\nidealistic painting and satire had been followed by a religious art\r\nwhich evaporated in Nazareanism; pure history in boots and spurs was\r\nnext preached as a religion. \"We stand,\" says Hotho in his history of\r\nGerman and Netherlandish painting, \"with our knowledge, culture, and\r\ninsight, on a summit from which we overlook the whole past. The Orient,\r\nGreece and Rome, the Middle Ages, the Reformation, and modern times,\r\nwith their religion, literature, and art, their deeds and their life,\r\nspread like a universal panorama before us; and it is one that we must\r\ngrasp with a universal feeling for the distinctiveness of every people,\r\nof every epoch, and of every character. In this fashion to bury one's\r\nself in the past, to get at the most essential meaning of its life by\r\nknowledge, to awaken what is dead, and by art to renew what is vanished,\r\nand thus to elevate the present to the level of the still living,\r\nkindred Mnemosyne of the past, such is the vivifying work of our time;\r\nand to that work its best powers must be devoted.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARL PILOTY.]\r\n\r\nThe first who worked with these principles in Germany was _Lessing_. He\r\nwas a great landscape painter, and a clever and amiable man, whose house\r\nin Karlsruhe was for many years a meeting-place for the polite world,\r\nand every beginner, every young man of talent, visited it to seek\r\nprotection. During the winter of 1832-33 Menzel's _Geschichte der\r\nDeutschen_ fell into his hands. In it he read the story of Huss and the\r\nHussites, and with \"The Hussite Sermon\" he soon afterwards began the\r\nsequence of pictures which had as their theme the battle between Church\r\nand State, the struggle of the Popes with the Emperors, the conflict\r\nbetween binding tradition and free personal conviction--a sequence to be\r\nviewed in connection with the opposition between authority and freedom\r\nwhich had actually arisen through Strauss' _Life of Jesus_. \"Huss before\r\nthe Council,\" \"Huss on his Way to the Stake,\" \"The Burning of the Papal\r\nBan,\" were found on their appearance exceedingly seasonable by the\r\northodox, Protestant side. For people were determined to see in them, at\r\none time, the protests of a Protestant against the Catholic art\r\ntendencies of the Nazarenes, at another, biting epigrams on the Catholic\r\nand pietistic bias, ruling in Prussia under Friedrich Wilhelm IV. They\r\nare of historical interest in so far as Lessing, before the period of\r\nFrench influence, anticipated in them the path on which the German\r\nhistorical painting--whose centre through Piloty came to be\r\nMunich--moved in the following years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PILOTY.   GIRONDISTS ON THE ROAD TO THE GUILLOTINE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Berlin Photographic Co., owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  PILOTY.   UNDER THE ARENA.]\r\n\r\n_Piloty's_ glory is to have planted the banner of colour on the citadel\r\nof the idealistic cartoon drawers. True, it was only the discarded\r\nfleshings of Delaroche; but since he possessed, side by side with a\r\nsolid ability, pedagogic capacities of the first rank, and thus brought\r\nto German art, in his own person, all the qualities which it had wanted\r\nduring half a century, his appearance was none the less most important\r\nin its consequences. Even to-day, beside Kaulbach's \"Jerusalem\" and\r\nSchnorr's \"Deluge\" in the new Pinakothek, his \"Seni\" is indicative of\r\nthe beginning of a new period. Before him the most celebrated men of\r\nthe Munich school made a boast of not being able to paint, and looked\r\ndown upon the \"colourers\" with a contemptuous shrug; so here everything\r\nwas attained which the young generation had admired in Gallait and\r\nBièfve. This astounding revelation of colour was in 1855 praised in\r\nGermany as something unheard of and absolutely perfect. There was no\r\nmore of the petty, motley, bodyless painting which had hitherto been\r\ndominant. The manner in which the grey of morning falls upon the\r\nmurdered man in the eerie chamber, the way the clothes and the silken\r\ncurtains glimmer, were things which enchanted artists, whilst the lay\r\npublic philosophised with the thoughtful Seni over the greatness of\r\nheroes and the destiny of the world. At one bound Piloty took rank as\r\nthe first German \"painter\"; he was the future, and he became the leader\r\nto whom young Munich looked up with wonder. Before him no one had known\r\nhow to paint a head, a hand, or a boot in such a way. No one could do so\r\nmuch, and by virtue of this technical strength he founded such a school\r\nas Munich had never yet seen. The consequence of his advent was that the\r\ntown could soon boast of many painters who thoroughly understood their\r\nbusiness. What an academical professor can give his pupils (thorough\r\ngroundwork in drawing and colour), that the young generation received\r\nfrom Piloty, who at his death might have said with more right than\r\nCornelius: \"We have left a better art than we found.\" He who discovered\r\nand guided so many men of talent, left behind him when he died a\r\nwell-drilled generation of painters; and far beyond the boundaries of\r\nMunich they assure him the honourable title of a preceptor of Germany.\r\nThe Munich movement does not offer the example of passionate and\r\nembittered battles, like those which the Parisian Romanticists\r\nmaintained against the Classicists of the school of David. The guard did\r\nnot die, but surrendered, and retired into an _otium cum dignitate_.\r\nWithout a contest the ground was left to the new generation, which was\r\nunited by no bond of tradition with that which had just been driven from\r\nthe field; it was left to an unphilosophic, unpoetic generation, whose\r\nonly endeavour was to bind together the threads of technical art which\r\nhad been torn by unalterable circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis revolution was accomplished with almost unnatural swiftness. In the\r\nlifetime of Cornelius himself the Franco-Belgian dogma of colour reached\r\nits end and summit in Makart, with whom colour is an elementary power,\r\noverflowing and levelling everything with the might of absolutism. In\r\nthe same year that Cornelius died \"The Pest in Florence\" made its tour\r\nthrough the world. Already Schwind and Steinle, those two children of\r\nVienna, had separated themselves from the thoughtful stringency of form\r\nand plastic clearness of their German comrades, by a certain coloured\r\nand lyrically musical element in their work. And now also it was an\r\nAustrian who again habituated the colour-blind eyes of the Germans to\r\nthe splendour of pigment. Michael Angelo's expression of form, as it had\r\nbeen imitated by Cornelius, was opposed by the colour-symphonies of the\r\nVenetians: drapery and jewels, brocade and velvet, and the voluptuous\r\nforms of women.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HANS MAKART.]\r\n\r\n_Hans Makart_ was a genius most picturesque in his mode of life. Whether\r\nthis life was enacted in his studio, fitted up like a ballroom, in the\r\nRing-Strasse, converted into a stage, or upon his canvas, everything was\r\ntransformed for him into decoration gleaming with colour. And through\r\nthis delight in colour the most important impulses were given in the\r\nmost diverse provinces of life. Against the dowdy lack of taste and the\r\nharsh gaiety of ladies' fashions in that era he set his distinguished\r\ncostume pictures, carried out in iridescent satin tones; and the\r\nenterprising modistes translated them into fact. The Makart hat, the\r\nMakart roses, the Makart bouquet--very old-fashioned, no doubt, at the\r\npresent time--were disseminated over the world. Under the influence of\r\nMakart the whole province of the more artistic trades was regarded from\r\na pictorial point of view. Oriental carpets, heavy silken stuffs,\r\nJapanese vases, weapons and inlaid furniture, became henceforth the\r\nprincipal elements of decoration. The fashionable world surrounded\r\nitself with brilliant colours; papers were supplemented by _portières_\r\nand Gobelins, ceilings were painted, and gay umbrellas stood in the\r\nfireplace. The bald, honest city-alderman style gave way, and a bright\r\ntriumph of colour took its place. In the studio of the master were the\r\nfinest blossoms of all epochs of art; richly ornamented German chests of\r\nthe Renaissance stood near Chinese idols and Greek terra-cotta, Smyrna\r\ncarpets and Gobelins, and old Italian and Netherlandish pictures were\r\nmingled with antique and mediæval weapons. And amid this rich still-life\r\nof splendid vessels, weapons, sculpture, and costly stuffs and costumes,\r\nwhich crowded all the walls and corners, there rose to the surface as\r\nfurther pieces of decoration a velvet coat, a pair of riding breeches,\r\nand a smart pair of Wallenstein boots. Their wearer was a little man\r\nwith a black beard, two piercing dark eyes, and one of those splendid\r\nbroad-browed heads which are universally accepted as the sign of genius.\r\n\r\nMakart's pictures are similar studies of still-life out of which human\r\nfigures rise to the surface. One hears the rustle of silk and satin, and\r\nthe crackle of costly robes of brocade; one sees velvet door-hangings\r\ndroop in heavy folds, but the figures which have their being in the\r\nmidst are merely bodies and not souls, flesh and no bones, colour and no\r\ndrawing. Sometimes he draws better and sometimes worse, but never well.\r\nAnd therefore he seems unspeakably small by the side of the old\r\nVenetians, who in such representation combined a highly developed\r\nknowledge of form with luxuriant brilliancy of colour. But even his\r\ncolour, that flaunting, piquant, bituminous painting derived from\r\nDelaroche, which once threw all Germany into ecstasies, no longer awakes\r\nany cordial enthusiasm; and the fault is only partially due to the rapid\r\ndecay, the sadly dilapidated appearance of his pictures. There is not\r\nmuch more remaining of them than of that shining festal procession which\r\nfor a forenoon set the streets of Vienna in uproar. Tone and colouring\r\nhave not become finer and more mellow with the years, as in old\r\nGobelins, but ever more spotty and dead. And even if they had remained\r\nfresh, would they yet appeal to the present generation, so much more\r\ndiscriminating in their appreciation of colour?\r\n\r\nMakart, so much lauded as a painter of flesh, was never really able to\r\npaint flesh at all. His feminine flesh tints are often bloodlessly\r\nwhite, and often tinged by an unpleasant, sugary rose hue. The fresh\r\nfragrance of life is not to be found in his figures, for they have been\r\nbegotten, not by contact with nature, but by commerce with old pictures.\r\nHe was often reproached with immorality by the prudish critics of\r\nearlier years; Heaven knows how stagnant and stereotyped this nudity\r\nseems in the present day, and how tame this sensuousness, even when\r\none's thoughts do not happen to have been raised to the great, carnal,\r\nand divine sensuousness of Rubens. Like Robert Hamerling, allied to him\r\nby his intoxication in colour, Makart had a great momentary success;\r\nbut, like the former, the brilliancy of his work has swiftly paled, and\r\nit is now seen how poor and sickly was the theme hidden behind the\r\nlavish instrumentation. Because a correct and solid anatomy was wanting\r\nto his creations from their birth upwards, they can live no longer now\r\nthat their blooming flesh is withered. In fact, Makart's painting was a\r\nweakly and superficial art. He had a sense for nothing but what was\r\nexternal. It is said that in Chile there are huge and splendid façades\r\non which are written _Museo Nacional_, _Theatro Nacional_, and there is\r\nnothing behind. And so for Makart the world was a house with a splendid\r\nfaçade glowing with colour, but without dwelling-rooms in which the\r\nsorrow and joy of humanity make their abode. His men do not think and do\r\nnot live; they are only lay figures for splendid garments, or materially\r\ncircumscribed spaces of rosy flesh colour; they make a stuffed,\r\nbrainless, animal effect. All his women heave up their eyes in the same\r\nmeaningless fashion, and have a vapid, doll-like trait about their white\r\nteeth, laid bare as if for the dentist. It makes no difference whether\r\nthey are meant to be portraits or merely embody a feminine plastic\r\nlyricism. It was not wise of Makart to paint a portrait. He might drape\r\nhis original after Palma Vecchio, after Rubens or Rembrandt, as\r\nSemiramis or a Japanese; his intellectual incapacity remained always the\r\nsame; the poetry of the psychical nature evaporated from his art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAKART.   THE ESPOUSALS OF CATTERINA CORNARO.]\r\n\r\nBut all that cannot alter the fact that Makart takes a very high place\r\namongst his contemporaries, in that epoch dominated by the historical\r\npainting, and not yet arrived at an original conception of nature.\r\nPoussin said of Raphael: if you compare him with the moderns he is an\r\neagle, but if you place him by the Greeks he is a sparrow. So when one\r\nthinks of Veronese or Rubens, one finds on Makart the feathers of a\r\nsparrow, but amongst his contemporaries in Germany he seems like an\r\neagle. While all those from whom he derived, those Pilotys, Gallaits,\r\nand Delaroches, were no more than skilled historians in painting,\r\nMakart, though much tamer and smaller, has a relationship with Delacroix\r\nin his sovereign artistry. That joy in the purely pictorial which\r\nexpressed itself in the festal procession in the Ring-Strasse and in the\r\nfurnishing of his studio was, moreover, the ground-principle of his art.\r\nWith the naïveté of the old masters he has boldly set himself above all\r\nhistorical truth; with absolute want of respect for books of history he\r\nhas committed anachronisms at which any critic would be irritated.\r\nRevelling in splendid revelations of colour, all that he concerned\r\nhimself about was that his costumed figures should render a fine harmony\r\nof hues. So exclusively was his eye organised for colour that every\r\npicture was first conceived by him on the palette as a luxuriant mass of\r\ncolour, and he invented afterwards the theme which was proper for it. If\r\nDelaroche transformed painting into the flat, sober, and scientifically\r\npedantic illustration of history, Makart gave it again a bright and\r\nsplendid play of colour. The Nazarenes were philosophers and\r\ntheosophers, the Romanticists revelled in lyrical sentiment. Kaulbach\r\nwas a philosophic historical student of the Hegelian school, Piloty a\r\nprosaic and declamatory professor of history, Makart was the first\r\nGerman _painter_ of the century. His personages weary themselves out in\r\nthe enjoyment of their own dazzling outward personality. Free as the\r\nancients with their gods and legends, he pours forth his Cupids,\r\nbeautiful women, genii, Bacchantes, and historical figures, and at the\r\nsame time draws into his kingdom of art all nature with its variety of\r\nplants, flowers, and fruits, all civilisation with its fulness of\r\nsplendid vessels and jewels, of shining stuffs, emblems, weapons, and\r\nmasks. All that he created breathes the naïve, sensuous satisfaction of\r\nthe genuine painter.\r\n\r\n\"The Pest in Florence\" undoubtedly had its origin in Boccaccio's\r\ndescription of the great epidemic which visited the town on the Arno;\r\nbut the picture is a free fantasy of sensuous enjoyment and naked flesh,\r\na colour symposium in which there really lives an atom of the flaming\r\nvital energy of Rubens.\r\n\r\nTake \"The Espousals of Catterina Cornaro,\" that gay procession of\r\nrepresentatives from Cyprus and Venice, of dignified men, of procurators\r\nof St. Mark, of women in foreign garb, of bright colour, who crowd round\r\ntheir young mistress, the queen of the feast, rejoicing amid the\r\nsplendid architecture of the piazza. To the anger of the historian, he\r\nremoves the scene from the fifteenth century to the blossoming period of\r\nthe sixteenth, when the creations of Sansovino, Titian, and Veronese\r\nadorned the Queen of the Adriatic. \"The Entry of Charles V into Antwerp\"\r\nderived only its external impulse from Dürer's Diary. The picture with\r\nthe naked girls strewing flowers might almost as well represent the\r\ntriumphal entry of Alexander into Babylon. In the magic land by the Nile\r\nit is not the history of civilisation and ethnography that attracts him,\r\nnor the monumental world of the pyramids and the temples of the gods,\r\nbut the sensuous glow of southern nature and the still-life and artistic\r\naccessories out of which the beautiful serpent Cleopatra is seen to\r\nrise. Female bodies, animals, and fruits, set in the midst of rich,\r\nluxuriant landscapes, painted with oil and bitumen, such are the\r\nelements of which his pictures of the old world of legend--the hunt of\r\nthe Amazons and of Diana--are composed.\r\n\r\nWith these capacities Makart was scenical painter _par excellence_. His\r\nAbundantia pictures in the Munich Pinakothek and the ceiling-pieces of\r\nthe Palais Tumba in Vienna are among his best creations. There lives in\r\nthem something of the Olympian blitheness of the ancients, of that easy\r\njoyousness which since Tiepolo seemed to have been buried in melancholy\r\nreflection and constrained brooding. They fulfil their purpose, as an\r\ninvitation to the enjoyment of life, precisely because they carry no\r\nintrinsic thought to burden the sensuous display. Moreover, the unctuous\r\nand gorgeous colouring, with the animated contrasts of warm brown and\r\nlight blue, mediated by the deep, glowing Makart red, corresponds to the\r\nmood they have been designed to awaken--one which called forth the joy\r\nof life, luxuriant, full-blooded, and foaming over. The great, fiery red\r\nflower, which sprouts out of the ground at the feet of the nymph in\r\n\"Spring,\" was the last thing touched by Makart's brush, the last flare\r\nof the marvellous colour-demon by which he was possessed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAKART.   THE FEAST OF BACCHUS.]\r\n\r\nWas _possessed_! For Makart's whole artistic endeavour had something\r\nunconscious. One might say in a variant reading from Lessing: \"If Makart\r\nhad been born without a brain he would nevertheless have been a great\r\npainter.\" It is as if one who lies buried in Antwerp had once more felt\r\nthe instinct of production, and let himself down into the great head of\r\nthe little Salzburger; and the head, being a somewhat imperfect medium,\r\nonly stammered out the intentions of the sublime master. There is\r\nsomething remarkable in the career of this son of the poor servant, on\r\nwhom fortune showered with full hands all it had to offer a child of the\r\nnineteenth century, and who in the midst of his splendour in Vienna\r\nremained always the same harmless child of nature that he had been in\r\nMunich, when, after receiving his first hundred florins, he drove in a\r\ncab the two steps from Oberpollinger to the Academy.\r\n\r\nOne must take him as he is--a product of nature. Makart was a scene\r\npainter, and that not in his scenical pictures only; but he was an\r\ninspired scene painter, of an enviable facility, who poured forth in\r\nplay what others fabricate with pains. His merit it is to have announced\r\nto the Germans afresh, in an overwhelming style, that revelation of\r\ncolour which had been forgotten since the Venetians and Rubens. He has\r\nnot advanced the history of art, as such. What he gave had been given\r\nbetter before. But the history of German art in the nineteenth century\r\nhas to honour in him the most perfect representative of the period in\r\nwhich colour-blindness was succeeded by exuberance of colour, and the\r\ncartoon style by the delight in painting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GABRIEL MAX.   _Graphische Kunst._]\r\n\r\nBeside Makart, the child of nature, _Gabriel Max's_ seems a calculating,\r\ntormented, unhealthy talent. In the manner in which Makart did his work\r\nthere lay a certain elementary, logical necessity; in Max there is a\r\ngreat deal of speculation and over-refinement. Makart's home was the\r\ntown on the lagoons. Max is by education and temperament a disciple of\r\nPiloty--that is to say, a painter of disasters; by birth he was a\r\nBohemian. And that resulted in his case in a very interesting mixture.\r\nWhen he exhibited his first pictures it was as if one heard a refined\r\nmusic after the tom-tom of Piloty. In his \"Martyr on the Cross,\" which\r\nappeared in the spring of 1867 in the Munich Kunstverein, he first\r\nstruck that bitter-sweet, half-torturing, half-ensnaring tone in which\r\nhe afterwards continued to sound. It is dawn; a soft grey light rests,\r\nbeaming mildly, over the lonely Campagna. Here stands a cross on which a\r\ngirl-martyr has ended her struggles. A young Roman coming home from a\r\nfeast is so thrilled by the heavenly peace in the expression of the\r\nunhappy girl's face that he lays a crown of roses at the foot of the\r\ncross, and becomes a convert to the faith for which she has suffered.\r\nThe mysterious mortuary sentiment in the subject is strengthened by the\r\nalmost ghostly pallor of the colouring. Everything was harmonised in\r\nwhite, except that one dark lock, falling across the pale forehead with\r\ngreat boldness, sounded like a shrill dissonance in the soft harmony,\r\nlike a wild scream; it had come there apparently quite by chance, but\r\nwas nevertheless calculated to a hair's breadth. The terribly touching\r\nvision of the martyr aroused in every visitor to the Kunstverein a\r\nshudder of delight. It was even a fine variation, and one which invited\r\npity, that the victim should not have been a hero, as in conventional\r\ncatastrophes, but a soft and sweet girl, made for love and never for the\r\ncross. And it was the more absorbing, too, because it was impossible to\r\nsay whether the young Roman was looking up to the beautiful woman with\r\nthe desecrating sensuality of a _décadent_ or with the fervid ecstasy of\r\na convert. The same horrified fascination was wakened again and again in\r\nthe presence of the later pictures of the painter. Almost every one\r\ncontained a scene of martyrdom, in which the tormented and sinking\r\nheroine was a helpless child or a weak and defenceless woman. The\r\npassion for tragic subjects brought into full swing by the historical\r\npainters was directed in Max against the purest and tenderest, the most\r\nchaste and the most lovely. The type was always the same, with its\r\nBohemian nose and one eye larger than the other, by which was attained a\r\ncuriously visionary or hysterically enthusiastic expression. And the\r\npictorial treatment corresponded to it: there was always a flesh-tint of\r\npoignant mortal pallor, a white clinging drapery, a black veil, a light\r\ngrey background, all harmonised in one very delicate chord.\r\n\r\nGoethe's Gretchen made the beginning. In the Zwinger she lifted up her\r\neyes in frightened anguish to the countenance of the Madonna. She sat in\r\nher cell, her face altered by madness and lit up with a wild laughter,\r\nand in a reverie passed her hand through Faust's locks. Or as a phantom\r\nshe wandered in the Walpurgis night, in her long, flowing shroud, with a\r\nblood-red stripe round her throat. This picture, exhibited with electric\r\nlight, was especially effective. Max had brought into the earnest\r\ncorpse-like eyes an expression that was terribly demoniacal, and had\r\nbeen attained to the same degree by no earlier illustrator of _Faust_. A\r\nraven, pecking at the lost ring, was her ghostly escort.\r\n\r\nMax showed great invention in hitting upon such things. Bürger's\r\n_Pfarrertochter von Taubenhain_ gave him the material for his\r\n\"Child-murderess\"--a young girl who, by the bank of a lonely pool,\r\novergrown with reeds, stabs her child to the heart with a needle, and in\r\na sudden rush of maternal love presses a kiss on the stiff little body\r\nbefore committing it to the water. Here the sombre, disconsolate\r\ncharacter of the landscape accorded finely with the action, and the pale\r\nbody of the child made an exceedingly bright, pungent spot of colour on\r\nthe dark-green rushes. \"The Lion's Bride\" illustrated Chamisso's ballad\r\nof the jealous lion who killed his mistress before her wedding, because\r\nhe would not give her over to another. Majestically he lies behind her,\r\nwith one paw on the arm of the slain, and the other struck into her\r\nthigh. The stones of the floor are reddened with her blood. But far more\r\nfrequently than blood Max employed the tints of corruption, the true\r\n_nature morte_. In its colour-values and subtle shades the dead human\r\nbody, just at the point where corruption begins, was better suited to\r\nthe painter's pallid scale of colour than the light and brutally\r\neffective red of freshly poured-out blood. Among these paintings of\r\nmortification must be reckoned \"Ahasuerus by the Body of a Child\" and\r\n\"The Anatomist\"; the latter meditatively regards at the dissecting-table\r\nthe corpse, covered with white linen, of a young girl who has committed\r\nsuicide. In his \"Raising of Jairus's Daughter\" the effect of\r\nmortification was most cleverly heightened by a small detail, which made\r\nan extraordinary impression: this was a fly on the naked arm of the\r\ngirl, put there to remind the spectator of the unconsciousness of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  MAX.   A NUN IN THE CLOISTER GARDEN.]\r\n\r\nThe secrets of death are always certain of their effect on the nerves;\r\nbut by means of the broken hearts of women, with annihilated hopes and\r\nagonised hysterical sufferings, he succeeded again in calling forth a\r\nbitter-sweet sympathy. \"Mary Magdalene\" and \"The Maid of Orleans\" were\r\nthe masterpieces of this group. The underlying idea of the picture\r\n\"Light\" is that a blind young Christian girl, at the portal of the Roman\r\ncatacombs, offers lamps to the entering Christians for the illumination\r\nof their dark way. The blind woman as the giver of light! Even in his\r\nyouth, with cruel irony, he had had sung by a blind quartet the song,\r\n\"_Du hast die schönsten Augen_.\" A touch of Delaroche is in the other\r\nyoung martyr, who, between the bloodthirsty beasts of the Roman circus,\r\nlooks up amazed to the rows of spectators, from the midst of which a\r\nyoung Roman has flung her a rose as a last greeting. In the next moment\r\nshe will be lying on the earth torn to shreds by the beasts.\r\n\r\nAs he succeeded here in giving a presentiment of the horrible, so in\r\nanother group of pictures Max attained a yet more demoniacal charm by\r\nthe ghostly. He had early made himself familiar with Schopenhauer and\r\nBuddha and the Indian fakirs; the mystical and spiritualistic movement\r\nhad just at that time been set going by the writings of Carl Du Prels.\r\nJustinus Kerner and the prophetess of Prevorst were the order of the\r\nday. Max became the painter of hypnotism and spiritualism. \"The Spirit's\r\nGreeting\" made a special sensation: the young girl at the piano, in this\r\npicture, is interrupted in her playing by the touch of a materialised\r\nghostly hand, which stretches towards her from a soft cloudy mist. The\r\nmixture of horror, joy, devotion, and ecstasy in the face of the young\r\nplayer was very effective. In order to render effects of the kind he\r\nmade extensive studies from the hypnotised model, and in this way he\r\nsometimes reached an extraordinary intensity of expression. He took a\r\ndecided position with regard to another question which at the time was\r\nvery acute--vivisection. This he did in the picture of the man of\r\nscience from whom an allegorical female figure, \"The Genius of Pity,\"\r\ntakes away a little dog doomed to be dissected, showing by a pair of\r\nscales that the human heart has more weight than the human\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nAll this goes to show that Max is the opposite of artless. He knows how\r\nto calculate an effect on the nerves with extreme subtlety, and most\r\nskilfully at times to give his pictures the attraction of the freshly\r\nprinted newspaper. He appeals to compassion rather than imagination. He\r\nwould set the heart beating violently. He triumphs generally by his\r\nsubjects, and his effects are much purer in those few works in which he\r\nrenounces the piquant adjunct of the demoniacal, the tragical, and the\r\nmystical, and becomes merely a painter. Amongst those works is to be\r\nreckoned that beautiful \"Madonna\" on the altar, painted in 1886, and so\r\ntenderly illustrating the verses of Heine--\r\n\r\n  \"Und wer eine Wachshand opfert,\r\n   Dem heilt an der Hand die Wund,\r\n   Und wer ein Wachsherz opfert,\r\n   Dem wird das Herz gesund.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so too does that charming \"Spring Tale\" of 1873, which breathes only\r\nof gaiety, happiness, and peace; a young girl sits under the blossoming\r\nbushes, and listens enraptured to the warbling of a nightingale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstängl._\r\n\r\n  MAX.   THE LION'S BRIDE.]\r\n\r\nThose pictures, the \"mood\" of which grows out of the landscape\r\naround--\"The Nun in the Cloister Garden,\" \"Adagio,\" \"The Spring Tale,\"\r\nand \"Autumn Dance\"--give Max a very high and peculiar place in the work\r\nof his period. He appears in them as a tender poet who expresses his\r\nemotions through a pictorial medium; as an adorer of nature of a soft\r\nmelancholy and subtle delicacy, which are to be found in like manner\r\nonly in the works of the Englishmen Frederick Walker, George Mason, and\r\nGeorge H. Boughton. Nature sings a hymn to the soul of the painter, and\r\nthrough his figures it is breathed forth in low, vibrating cadences. A\r\ntender landscape of earliest spring gave the ground-tone to his charming\r\npicture \"Adagio.\" Young trees with trembling stems raise their slender\r\ncrowns into the pale blue sky flecked with clouds. As yet the branches\r\nare almost naked; only here and there appears the embroidery of fresh\r\nyellowish green. And in this soft, tender nature which shyly reveals\r\nitself as with a slight shudder after its long winter sleep, there are\r\nseated two beings: a boy and his young mother--she looks almost a\r\nchild--dreamily meditating. Their eyes look strangely into vacancy, as\r\nthough their thoughts are wandering. Nature works on them, and a\r\nmelancholy _Warte nur balde_ runs through their souls. A spring\r\nlandscape of blissful gaiety, where nightingales warble, butterflies sip\r\nat the flowers, and sunbeams play coquettishly round the budding\r\nrosebushes, is the Setting of the \"Spring Tale.\" Everything laughs and\r\nrejoices, shines and scents the air in the early sunlight. Pearls of dew\r\nsparkle on the meadows, gnats hum and leaves murmur. She thinks of him.\r\nAll the joy of a first love-dream sets her heart quivering with a\r\ndelicious tremor. In her heart as in nature it is spring. Yet even as a\r\nlandscape painter Max generally has that tender, suffering trait which\r\nruns through his creative work elsewhere. Twilight, autumn, pale sky and\r\ndead leaves have made the deepest impression on his spirit. Thin,\r\nhalf-stunted trees, in the leaves of which the evening wind is playing,\r\ngrow upon an undulating, poverty-stricken soil. The landscape spreads\r\naround with a kind of lyrical melancholy: a region which gives no\r\nexuberant assurance of being beautiful, but which, in its poverty,\r\nattunes the mind to melancholy; a region, however, which knows not of\r\nstorms and loneliness, but is the peaceful dwelling of quiet and\r\nresigned men. These beings belong to no age; their costume is not\r\nmodern, but neither is it taken from any earlier period. They do not act\r\nand they tell no story; they dream their time away meditatively and\r\ngravely. Max has divested them of everything fleshly and vulgar, so that\r\nonly a shadow of them remains, a soul that vibrates in exquisite, dying,\r\nelusive chords. \"The Autumn Dance\" is such an unearthly picture, and one\r\nof indefinable magic. Children and women are dancing, yet one feels them\r\nto be religious dreamers whom a melancholy world-weariness and a\r\nyearning after the mystical have drawn together to this secret and\r\nsequestered corner of the earth. The pale, transparent air, the tender\r\ntints of the dresses, delicate as fading flowers, the flesh tint giving\r\nthe figures something ghostly and ethereal--it all strikes a note at\r\nonce blythe and sentimental, happy and sad. \"The Nun in the Cloister\r\nGarden\" is in point of landscape one of his finest productions. In the\r\ncloister garden, despite the budding spring, there reigns a disconsolate\r\ndreariness. On the thin grass sits a young nun, who follows dreamily the\r\ngay fluttering of two butterflies, which flit around at her feet. A\r\nblack dress, harshly and abruptly crossed by a white cape, envelops the\r\nyouthfully delicate form. The dying sapling on which she is leaning\r\nbends helplessly against the stubborn paling to which it is fastened\r\nwith iron clamps. The weather-stained wall stretches along in a dreary\r\nmonotonous grey. An old sundial relentlessly indicates the slow dragging\r\nhours. But the deep blue heaven, in which a pair of larks poise\r\nexulting, looks in across the wall, from which a scrubby growth climbs\r\nshivering in the breeze.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Graphische Kunst._\r\n\r\n  MAX.   LIGHT.]\r\n\r\nIn such pictures, too, Max has a morbid inclination to a mystical\r\ndelicacy of sentiment. He gives what is real an exquisite subtlety which\r\ntransplants it into the world of dreams, and his tender sense of pain\r\nperhaps appeals only to spirits of an æsthetic temper. He is the\r\nantithesis of robust health; and yet there lies in the excess of nervous\r\nsensibility--in the pathological trait in his art--precisely the quality\r\nwhich inspires the characteristic delicacy of his earlier works. Here is\r\nno pupil of Piloty, but our contemporary. In their anæmic colour his\r\npictures have the effect of a song of high, fine-drawn, and tremulous\r\nviolin tones, at once dulcet and painful. With their refinement and\r\npolish, their subtle taste and intimate emotion, so wonderfully mingled,\r\nthey reach the music of painting. They paint the invisible, they revel\r\nin dreams. In a period which played only _fortissimo_, and was at pains\r\nto drum on all the senses at once with a distorting passion, Max was,\r\nnext to Feuerbach, the first who prescribed for his compositions\r\n_dolce_, _adagio_, and _mezza voce_; who sought for the refined, subdued\r\nemotions in place of the _emotions fortes_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstängl._\r\n\r\n  MAX.   THE SPIRIT'S GREETING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gräphische Kunst._\r\n\r\n  MAX.   ADAGIO.]\r\n\r\nThese pictures, the more subdued the better, make him the forerunner of\r\nthe most modern artists, and assure his name immortality much more\r\ncertainly than the great figure resting on an historical or literary\r\nbasis. Their delicate black, green, and white simplicity has a nobleness\r\nof colouring which stands quite alone in the German painting of the\r\ncentury, and this, together with their refined musical sentiment, is\r\nprobably to be set rather to the account of his Bohemian blood than of\r\nhis Munich training. And whilst in the heads of his figures elsewhere a\r\ncertain monotonous vacuity disturbs one's pleasure, he appears here as a\r\npsychic painter of the highest mark; one who analysed with the most\r\nsubtle delicacy all the fleeting _nuances_--so hard to catch--of\r\nmelancholy, silent resignation, yearning, and hopelessness. Only the\r\nfigures of the English new pre-Raphaelites have the same sad-looking,\r\ndove-like eyes, the same spiritual lips, tremulous as though from\r\nweeping. There must have been a divine moment in his existence when he\r\nfirst filled the loveliest form with the expression of the holiest\r\nsuffering, the sweetest reverie, the deepest devotion, and the most rapt\r\necstasy. And if later, when people could not weary of this expression,\r\nhe took to producing it without real feeling and by purely stereotyped\r\nmeans, that is, at any rate, a weakness of temperament which he shares\r\nwith others.\r\n\r\nGabriel Max is an individuality, not of the first rank indeed, but he is\r\none; and there are not many painters of the nineteenth century of whom\r\nthat can be said. He has often underlined too heavily, printed too much\r\nin italics, and done more homage to crude than to fine taste. But he\r\nhas, in advance of his contemporaries, in whose works the good was so\r\nseldom new, the priceless virtue that he always gave something new, if\r\nnot something good. His art was without ancestry, an entirely personal\r\nart; something which no one had before Max, and which after him few will\r\nproduce again. A province which had not yet been trodden, the province\r\nof the enigmatic and ghostly, was opened up by him; he set foot in it\r\nbecause he is a philosophic brooder, fascinated by the magic of the\r\nuncanny. His studio is like a chapel in which a mysterious service for\r\nthe dead is being held, or the chamber of an anatomist, rather than the\r\nworkroom of a painter. The investigation of dead birds occupied him\r\nafter his Prague days just as much as the sounding of the life of the\r\nhuman spirit. He lived at the time with his parents in an old, ghostly\r\nhouse, and roamed about a great deal in the picture gallery of the\r\nStrahow foundation; and here in lonely nights and mysterious\r\npicture-rooms there arose that grave and sombre spirit which runs\r\nthrough his work. As a child at the death of his father he had his first\r\n\"vision.\" His earliest picture, which he finished while at the Prague\r\nAcademy, and sold afterwards to the Art Union there for ninety florins,\r\nshowed that he had begun to move on his later course: \"Richard the\r\nLion-heart steps to the Corpse of his Father and it bleeds.\" He was thus\r\ninwardly ripe when, in 1863, he came to Piloty in Munich, and, equipped\r\nwith the technique of the latter, refined in so delicate a manner on the\r\ntraditional painting of disasters. And if a conscious design on the\r\nnerves of the multitude frequently entered into his work, it was, as a\r\nrule, veiled by captivating beauty and excellence of painting. His older\r\ngood pictures fascinate the most jaded eye by their remarkably tender\r\nsentiment, and the mystical spirituality of his soft and lovely girlish\r\nheads has been reached by few in his century. He is at the same time a\r\ncolourist of complete individuality, who made pigments the subtilised\r\nand ductile means of expression for his visionary moods of soul. He has\r\nbrought into the world a numerous stock of works prepared for the\r\nmarket; and he has not disdained to paint glorified wonders of the fair,\r\nlike the Christ's head upon the handkerchief of Veronica, whose eyes\r\nseem to be closed by their lids and are looking out at the same time\r\nwide open. But much as he sinned, he always remained an artist. A\r\ncurious, interesting, characteristic mind, one of the few who ventured\r\neven forty years ago to give themselves out as children of their time,\r\nin the firmament of German, and indeed of European art, he appears as a\r\nstar shining by its own and not by borrowed light, as one whose\r\nincommensurable magnitude it is that his talent cannot be compared with\r\nany other. That is what gives him his artistic importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAX.   A WINTER'S TALE.]\r\n\r\nAll the less room can be claimed by the many who, likewise following in\r\ntheir subject-matter the lines of Piloty, get no further than the\r\ntraditional catastrophe. Not Munich only, but all Germany, lay for more\r\nthan a decade after the middle of the century under the shadow of\r\nhistorical painting, which here, as in other countries, came as the\r\nlogical product of an unhappy time, dissatisfied with its own existence\r\nwhen Germany was merely a geographical expression, and in the pitiable\r\nmisery of that age of state-confederations, dreamt of a better future at\r\nsinging contests, athletic tournaments, and rifle meetings. The more\r\npoverty-stricken the time was in real action, the more vehement was the\r\ndesire to read of action in books or to see it on canvas; and in this\r\nrespect historical painting rendered at that time important political\r\nservices, which are to be acknowledged with gratitude; just as the\r\nhistorical drama, the historical ballad and the historical novel were,\r\nall and several, means for the expression of the deep-seated longing of\r\na backward people for political labours, for deeds and for fame.\r\n\r\nBut the artistic yield was not greater than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhen the learned in the thirties laid it down in doctrinaire fashion\r\nthat, with the destruction of religious fervour begun by science, the\r\nold traditionary sacred painting would fall away of itself and the\r\npainting of profane history take its place, they overlooked from the\r\nvery beginning the fact that, so long as the much discussed worship of\r\ngenius had not actually become a reality the painting of history had to\r\nfight against insuperable obstacles. What constitutes the prime\r\ncondition of all art--that its contents must be some fact vivid in\r\nconsciousness--should, at any rate, determine its limitations, and ought\r\nto have confined the historical picture to the nearest universally known\r\nsubjects. And what happened was just the contrary.\r\n\r\nWhen Delaroche had skimmed the cream, his successors were forced to\r\nsearch in the great martyr book of history for events which were more\r\nand more unknown and indifferent. Piloty took from ancient history \"The\r\nDeath of Alexander the Great,\" \"The Death of Cæsar,\" \"Nero at the\r\nBurning of Rome,\" and \"The Triumphal Progress of Germanicus\"; and from\r\nmediæval history, \"Galileo in his Prison observing the Periodic Return\r\nof a Solar Ray,\" and \"Columbus sighting Land\"; from the history of the\r\nThirty Years' War, \"The Foundation of the Catholic League by Duke\r\nMaximilian of Bavaria,\" \"Seni before the Body of Wallenstein\" (the\r\nmorning before the battle at the White Mountain, Seni has come to carry\r\naway Wallenstein's body), \"Wallenstein on the way to Eger,\" and \"The\r\nNews of the Battle at the White Mountain\"; from English history, \"The\r\nDeath Sentence of Mary Stuart\"; and from French history, \"The Girondists\r\non their Way to the Scaffold.\"\r\n\r\nAfter these pictures were painted and had had their success the turn\r\ncame, in the years immediately following, for subjects growing steadily\r\nmore and more dreary. And as Goethe held the historical to be \"the most\r\nungrateful and dangerous field,\" so it now appeared as though laurels\r\nwere to be gathered there only. From the political dismemberment of the\r\npresent, German artists were glad to seek refuge as far back as possible\r\nin the past, and they flung themselves on the new province with such\r\nfiery zeal that, after a few decades, there was a really appalling\r\nnumber of historical pictures, illustrating every page of Schlosser's\r\ngreat history of the world. _Max Adamo_ painted \"The Netherlandish\r\nNobles before the Tribunal of Alva,\" \"The Fall of Robespierre in the\r\nNational Convention,\" \"The Prince of Orange's Last Conversation with\r\nEgmont,\" \"Charles I meeting Cromwell at Childerley,\" \"The Dissolution of\r\nthe Long Parliament,\" and \"Charles I receiving the Visit of his Children\r\nat Maidenhead\"; _Julius Benczur_: \"The Departure of Ladislaus Hunyadi,\"\r\nand \"The Baptism of Vajk,\" afterwards King Stephen the Holy of Hungary;\r\n_Josef Fluggen_: \"The Flight of the Landgravine Elizabeth,\" \"Milton\r\ndictating Paradise Lost,\" and \"The Landgravine Margarethe taking leave\r\nof her Children\"; by _Carl Gustav Hellquist_ there were \"The Death of\r\nthe wounded Sten Sture after the Battle of Bogesund in the Mälarsee,\"\r\n\"The Embarkment of the Body of Gustavus Adolphus,\" and the forced\r\ncontribution of \"Wisby and Huss going to the Stake.\" _Ernst Hildebrand_\r\nhad the Electress of Brandenburg secretly taking the sacrament in both\r\nkinds, and Tullia driving over the corpse of her father; _Frank\r\nKirchbach_ displayed \"Duke Christopher the Warrior\"; _Ludwig von\r\nLangenmantel_: \"The Arrest of the French Chemist Lavoisier under the\r\nReign of Terror,\" and \"Savonarola's Sermon against the Luxury of the\r\nFlorentines\"; _Emanuel Leutze_: a \"Columbus before the Council of\r\nSalamanca,\" \"Raleigh's Departure,\" \"Cromwell's Visit to Milton,\" \"The\r\nBattle of Monmouth,\" and \"The Last Festival of Charles I\"; _Alexander\r\nLiezenmayer_: \"The Coronation of Charles Durazzo in Stuhlweissenburg,\"\r\nand \"The Canonisation of the Landgravine Elizabeth of Thüringen\";\r\n_Wilhelm Lindenschmit_: \"Duke Alva at the Countess of Rudolstadt's,\"\r\n\"Francis I at Pavia,\" \"The Death of Franz Von Sickingen,\" \"Knox and the\r\nScottish Image-breakers,\" \"The Assassination of William of Orange,\"\r\n\"Walter Raleigh visited in his Cell by his Family,\" \"Luther before\r\nCardinal Cajetan,\" \"Anne Boleyn giving her Child Elizabeth to the care\r\nof Matthew Parker,\" and \"The Entrance of Alaric into Rome\"; _Alexander\r\nWagner_: \"The Departure of Isabella Zapolya from Siebenbürgen,\" \"The\r\nEntry into Aschaffenburg of Gustavus Adolphus,\" \"The Wedding of Otto of\r\nBavaria,\" \"The Death of Titus Dugowich,\" \"Matthias Corvinus with his\r\nHunting Train,\" and many more of the same description.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstängl._\r\n\r\n  MAX.   MADONNA.]\r\n\r\nWas it at all possible to make works of art out of such material?\r\nPerhaps it was. The real artist can do anything. What he touches becomes\r\ngold, for he has the hand of Midas. But just as certain it is that the\r\n\"historical painting,\" carried on by a joint-stock company, almost never\r\ngot any further than stage pathos, tailoring, and glittering splendour\r\nof material. Like many another thing which the nineteenth century\r\nbrought to birth, it was an artistic error, which countless persons paid\r\nfor by the waste of their lives. The older art knew nothing of such a\r\nreconstruction of the past. If historical subjects were painted, the\r\nartists were almost throughout contemporaries of the subject that was to\r\nbe treated; seldom did the materials belong to an epoch already past.\r\nBut in both cases the work was done by immediate intuition, since even\r\nin the treatment of matters long gone by the painters never dreamed of\r\npainting them in the spirit of past times. They might depict Jews, or\r\nGreeks, or Romans, but they always represented their own countrymen in\r\nthe surroundings and costume of their own time. The scientific\r\nnineteenth century made the first demand for historical accuracy. In\r\ndress and furniture this could be attained with the assistance of a\r\ncabinet of engravings and a work on costume. Whoever went to work in a\r\nvery scientific spirit could even borrow from a museum the genuine\r\ncostumes of Egmont and Wallenstein. But it was all the harder\r\nartistically to quicken into life the men themselves who had felt,\r\nlived, and suffered in the past. The painter could not proceed otherwise\r\nthan by draping a modern, professional model, having consulted\r\nportraits, drawings, or busts, and having sought the aid of a peruke and\r\nfalse beard. An entirely realistic reproduction of this masquerade,\r\nhowever, made only too evident the contrast between the splendid old\r\ngarment and the member of the proletariat who was dressed up in it. For,\r\ngranted that men of the present have much in common with those of the\r\npast, every period has none the less its own type, even its own\r\ngestures, which no costume can make one forget. And speaking merely of\r\ngeneral humanity, there is no question that a statesman at all times\r\nlooked different from a professional model. In a very bad suit of\r\nclothes, but in one which, at any rate, fitted him, and in which he was\r\nable to behave himself naturally, the poor fellow came to the studio, to\r\nfeel, for a few hours, in satin hose and a velvet doublet, like a\r\ncarnival figure. Who was to give him the easy knightly bearing to play\r\nhis part suitably to the occasion? It was not possible in this way ever\r\nto attain the naturalness and fulness of life of the old painters. In\r\nTerborg's \"Peace of Westphalia\" everything is genuine and true and\r\nsimple; here wig and woollen beard have got the upper hand. And if the\r\npainter proceeded not as a theatrical tailor, but as an historian of\r\ncivilisation, the result was an archaic dryness. For then he was merely\r\nthrown back on the great masters of those periods in which the action\r\ntook place, and, while he enlarged and coloured old busts or engraved\r\nportraits, his art was only second-hand.\r\n\r\nAnd so the only way out of the difficulty was to use the model, but to\r\nidealise him by generalising and sinking the individual in the\r\nuniversally human, noble, and heroic. In this way the remarkable family\r\nlikeness of all these heads becomes comprehensible, and it is still\r\nfurther heightened by that preference for a monotonous type of beauty\r\nwhich, from the period of Classicism, entered, as it were, into the\r\nblood of these painters. The human physiognomy, in reality so various,\r\nhad then only one mask for the many characters which life creates. There\r\nwas a fear of \"ugliness,\" as if it were a spot of dirt, and the\r\npersonages portrayed received, one and all, an icy trait of \"the\r\nBeautiful.\" The various Egmonts, Wallensteins, and Charles the Firsts of\r\nGallait and Bièfve, Delaroche, and Piloty have not the blood of human\r\nbeings, they have not the scars which are made by fate, but are all\r\nalike in their Byronic turn of the head. One knows the so-called\r\ncharacter-heads--Luther gazing upwards with the look of one strong in\r\nfaith, Columbus discovering America, and Milton in whose head are\r\nseething all the thoughts which dying men are wont to have in their last\r\nmoments,--one knows them as thoroughly by heart as one knows all the\r\nopened folios and overturned settles, the picturesquely draped tapestry\r\nreserved for tragic funereal service, and that little box, covered with\r\nbrass and catching the flashing lights, which constitutes in Belgium,\r\nFrance, and Germany the iron casket of all historical pieces. In the\r\nplace of the inward Shakespearian truth of the figures, peculiar to the\r\nold masters, is the outward truth of costume; and the historical\r\n\"property man,\" whose highest aim is to \"dress\" the great moments of\r\nuniversal history in the prescribed manner, has stepped into the place\r\nof the artist. In the works of the old masters the historical figures\r\nstand out with sincerity as characters of flesh and blood, despite the\r\nwant of \"local colour,\" whilst in the moderns the costumes certainly are\r\ncorrect, but the figures are so much the less credible and vital.\r\n\"Beautiful may be the folds of the garment, but more beautiful must be\r\nthat which they contain.\"\r\n\r\nClothes do not make people, and costumes heighten no passions. Thus\r\ndifficulties were heaped on difficulties, when impassioned situations\r\nand moments of dramatic intensity were to be painted. Whoever has\r\nreached that height of artistic power where the artist may with impunity\r\nput his model out of his head--like Delacroix, grand, volcanic, stormy,\r\nand excited to a fever heat by his inspiration,--that man will be\r\ncapable of giving the effect of truth to such scenes, and of running\r\nthrough the whole gamut of emotion with a crushing power of conviction.\r\nBut the joint-stock historical painter had to get his models to pull\r\nfaces, and then no less laboriously to render with his oils those\r\ngrimaces so laboriously produced. Hence the monotonous and petrified\r\nhistrionic ecstasy of these pictures, the noble indignation put on for\r\nshow, and that distressing gesticulation. As the actor gives emphasis to\r\nhis words far more by gestures than is the case in ordinary life, so\r\nhere also the artificially impassioned air of the heads was\r\nconventionally interpreted by corresponding motions of the arms. And\r\nthus the closing tableau was made ready: the dancers lay their hands on\r\ntheir hearts with tender and deep feeling; the tenor heroes sing that\r\nthey are prepared to die; the tyrants let their deep basses vibrate, and\r\nthe orchestra rages, to close with a shattering chord at the moment when\r\nthe hero sets his foot upon the chest of the traitor; then come the\r\nBengal lights, and then the curtain falls. What a spectacle!--but, alas,\r\na spectacle and nothing more. All the emotions are artificial; they are\r\nopera emotions: the painters are only clever fellows, manufacturers of\r\nlibrettos and gay canvas; they show a great deal of knowledge and\r\ndexterity, but they have only a head and no heart. Stage requisites and\r\nprofessional models can never take the place of the free, creative force\r\nof imagination.\r\n\r\nAnd if German pictures of this sort have an effect almost more insincere\r\nand theatrical than the French, the reason probably is that\r\ngesture--that external aid to the expression of feeling--is always more\r\nnatural to the Latin than the Teutonic races, and has therefore, of\r\nitself, an effect of affectation in every German picture. We know that\r\nBismarck, the Teuton incarnate, even in the most excited of\r\nparliamentary speeches, never made any other movement than to rap\r\nnervously with his pencil. \"The German only becomes impassioned when he\r\nlies.\" The most genuine masters of German blood have felt that right\r\nwell, and they have been honest enough to say it out. A pervading trait\r\nof old German art is simplicity, the avoidance of everything impassioned\r\neven in the grandest conception, such as Dürer has. If in Leonardo's\r\n\"Last Supper\" terror, indignation, curiosity, and sorrow are reflected\r\nby twelve heads and twenty-four hands in movements of agitation which\r\nare always new, in Dürer's woodcut all the limbs and senses of the\r\ndisciples are paralysed at the sorrowful revelation of the Saviour; it\r\nseemed to them desecration to break the solemn, oppressive stillness by\r\nnoisy utterances of opinion and hasty gestures. And the same thing is to\r\nbe remarked in every similar picture of Rembrandt's; here too are only\r\nquiet and subdued movements, delicate suggestions and silence. The\r\neffect is great and sublime, the features of the Saviour earnest and\r\nexpressive, but His mien is without any ecstatic emphasis such as a\r\npainter of Romance blood would have given Him. Only in the nineteenth\r\ncentury--partly through imitation of the Italians in Cornelius and\r\nKaulbach, and then through imitation of the French in Piloty and his\r\ndisciples--has this impassionedness, so opposed to German nature,\r\nentered into German art; and it has borrowed from the opera the\r\ndistortions by which it has expressed the agitations of the spirit. No\r\none works with impunity against the grain of his temperament.\r\nExaggerated and violent movements, \"ostentatious gestures of false\r\ndignity,\" have replaced the natural expressions of life.\r\n\r\nLess pose, parade, and theatricality, more ease, truth, and quietude;\r\nless insipid, generalised \"beauty,\" more forcible, characteristic\r\n\"ugliness\": if art was not to be drowned in a surge of phrases, this was\r\nthe path to be taken; and the transition was accomplished in \"the\r\nhistorical picture of manners.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE VICTORY OVER PSEUDO-IDEALISM\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the epoch-making labours of the historians followed the\r\nfirst romances that were archæological and dealt with the history of\r\ncivilisation; and hand in hand with these literary productions there was\r\ndeveloped--by the side of historical painting proper, in France,\r\nBelgium, and Germany--a tendency to represent the life of the past, not\r\nin its grand dramatic action, but in its familiar concerns. In the one\r\ncase there was history in its state uniform, in the other history in\r\nundress. And while the former class of painters saw the past only in a\r\ncondition of unrest and violent movement, the latter began to enter into\r\nthe details of daily life, and to represent it as it flowed by in times\r\nof peace. Those who had the romantic bias turned to the old artistic\r\ncrafts. As yet that bias consisted only in an enthusiasm for the\r\ntasteful civilisation of a bygone age, with its polished charm of\r\nluxurious household appointments and pleasing costume. Rooms were filled\r\nwith Gobelins and rich stuffs, handsome furniture and old pictures. By\r\nthe rapid sale of their productions painters were placed in a position\r\nto acquire for themselves at the second-hand dealers all the beautiful\r\nthings they painted. They placed their dressed-up models in front of\r\ntheir tapestries, and between their cabinets and tables. Stress was laid\r\non historical accuracy in the representation of the usages and costumes\r\nof the past, not on dramatic action, and in this respect the historical\r\npicture of manners, as opposed to historical painting, marked an advance\r\ntowards intimacy of feeling. The latter still worked from the abstract.\r\nThe painter read a book and looked out for telling passages. He\r\nidealised models, to lend his picture the character of \"great art.\" It\r\nwas always the illustration of underlying ideas.\r\n\r\nIn this new kind of picture, on the contrary, the conception of a work\r\nof art was given, by the perfected representation of any part of the\r\nvisible world, were it only the corner of a studio elaborately and\r\nartificially arranged. The historical picture of manners no longer\r\ndepicted \"the meeting of hostile forces,\" but either the heroes of\r\nhistory or the nameless men of the past in their daily act and deed, and\r\nso accustomed the public gradually to interest themselves in people who\r\ndid not act with histrionic passion, but conducted themselves quietly\r\nand soberly like men of the present time. The place of the dramatic was\r\ntaken by those phases of life which are pleasant and smooth. At the same\r\ntime there was no need to be thrown back on conventional idealisation,\r\nand it was possible to bring people dressed up for the occasion directly\r\ninto the picture, just as they sat there, since the contrast between the\r\nprofessional model and the old-fashioned dress made itself less felt on\r\nthis smaller scale of art. Thus was achieved the transition from the\r\nheroic historical art of the first half of the nineteenth century to\r\nthat familiar and more human art of the second half, which no longer\r\nfled for help to the past, but sought a simpler ideal in reality.\r\n\r\nFirst of all in France, from the side of the solemnly earnest group of\r\nAcademicians, there stepped forward certain artists who moved in the old\r\nworld quite at their ease, and began to paint simple little pictures\r\nfrom the daily life of antiquity, instead of the great ostentatious\r\ncanvases of David and Ingres. In literature their parallels are Ponsard\r\nand Augier, who in their comedies brought antique life upon the stage,\r\nthe one in _Horace et Lydie_, the other in _La Ciguë_ and _Le Joueur de\r\nFlûte_.\r\n\r\n_Charles Gleyre_ approached nearest to the strict academical style of\r\nIngres. Not even by a tour in the East did he allow himself to be led\r\naway from the Classical manner, and as head of a great and leading\r\nstudio he recognised it as the task of his life to hand on to the\r\npresent generation the traditions of the school of Ingres. Gleyre was a\r\nman of sound culture, who during a sojourn in Italy which lasted for\r\nyears, had examined Etruscan vases and Greek statues with unintermittent\r\nzeal, studied the Italian classics, and copied all Raphael. Having come\r\nback to Paris, he never drew a line without having first assured himself\r\nhow Raphael would have proceeded in the given case. And this striving\r\nafter purity of form has robbed his works (\"Nymph Echo,\" \"Hercules at\r\nthe Feet of Omphale,\" and the like) almost entirely of ease, freshness,\r\nand naturalness. Gleyre became, like Ary Scheffer, a victim to style. He\r\nhad in him--his \"Evening\" of 1843 is sufficient to show it--a tender,\r\ndreamy, and contemplative spirit. The feelings to which he wished to\r\ngive expression were his own, and the more fragrant, romantic, and\r\nvaporously indistinct they were, the more did they suffer from the stiff\r\nacademical line in which he so mercilessly bound them. Only in his\r\n\"Orpheus torn by the Bacchantes\" has he raised himself to a certain\r\nneo-Greek elegance.\r\n\r\n_Louis Hamon_ stands at the end of this path, which led gradually from\r\nthe strictness of form characteristic of the idealism of Ingres to\r\nincidents thought out in perfectly modern fashion and laid in a\r\nprimitive era only because of the advantages of costume offered by the\r\nantique. The grace of his pictures is modern; their Classicism is a\r\ndisguise. To robust natures his art can make but little appeal. He has\r\ndeprived nature of her strength and marrow, and painting of its peculiar\r\nqualities, transforming them into a coloured dream, a tinted mist. In\r\nHamon's modelling there is an uncertainty, in his colour a sickly\r\nweakness and meagre effeminacy, which give to his figures and landscapes\r\nthe appearance of being dissolved in vapour. Everything firm is taken\r\nfrom them; the stones look like wadding, the plants like soap, the\r\nfigures like china dolls which would fly into the air at the least gust\r\nof wind. Nevertheless there are times when his confectionery has a\r\nsympathetic grace. What distinguishes him is something simple, pure,\r\nyouthful, fresh, and childlike. His colour is lighter and more delicate\r\nthan Gleyre's. None but blended colours such as light blue and light\r\nyellow mingle in the harmony of white tones. The severe antique style\r\nhas been given a pretty _rococo_ turn: his Greek girls, women, and\r\nchildren are like figures of Sèvres porcelain; the scenes in which he\r\ngroups them are pleasing,--sports of fancy brought forward in a Grecian\r\ngarb, of an affected sensuousness and a coquettish grace. His prettiest\r\npicture was probably \"My Sister's not at Home\"--Greece seen through a\r\ngauze transparency in the theatre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  HAMON.   MY SISTER'S NOT AT HOME.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Messrs. Boussod, Valadon & Co., the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\n_Léon Gérôme_ has also a taste for borrowing his subjects from the\r\nantique; being a pupil of Delaroche, however, he has treated not\r\nmythological but historical episodes of antiquity. His \"Cock-fight,\"\r\n\"Phryne before the Areopagus,\" \"The Augurs,\" \"The Gladiators,\"\r\n\"Alcibiades at the House of Aspasia,\" and \"The Death of Cæsar,\" together\r\nwith pictures from Egypt, are his most characteristic works: Ingres and\r\nDelaroche upon a smaller scale. He shares with the one his learnedly\r\npedantic composition, and with the other his taste for anecdote. It may\r\nbe remarked that in these same years Emile Augier was active in\r\nliterature, but that Augier, living in the same epoch of modern life, is\r\nfar more powerful and animated in his Classical pieces. Gérôme's art is\r\nan intelligent, frigid, calculating art. In execution he does not rise\r\nabove a petty study of form and an academic discipline. His drawing is\r\naccurate, and he has even succeeded in giving his figures a certain\r\nnatural truth which is in advance of the generalisation of the classic\r\nideal; yet from first to last he is wanting in every quality as a\r\npainter. His pictures of the East are hard landscapes, in which men or\r\nanimals, harder still--unfortunate, eternally petrified beings--stand\r\nout abruptly. He draws and stipples, he works like an engraver in line,\r\nand goes over what he has painted again and again with a fine and feeble\r\nbrush. He has an eye for form, but the effect of light upon the body\r\nescapes him. His pictures therefore give the impression of china, and\r\nhis colour is hard and dead. What distinguishes him is a watchful\r\nobservation, a chilling correctness, enclosing everything in\r\ncharacterless outlines. And this marble coldness remained with him later\r\nwhen, moving with the development of historical painting, he gradually\r\ntook to working on more tragical subjects. Even the most violent\r\nsubjects are depicted with a dainty grace, and with a smile he serves up\r\ndecapitated heads, prepared with a painting _à la maitre d'hôtel_, upon\r\na gold-rimmed porcelain plate as smooth as glass.\r\n\r\nAnother painter of archæological _genre_ is _Gustave Boulanger_, who\r\nafter extensive studies in Pompeii gave a vogue to those antique\r\ninteriors and scenes of Pompeian street life now associated with the\r\nname of Alma-Tadema.\r\n\r\nDirect descendants of Delaroche and Robert Fleury were those who threw\r\nthemselves enthusiastically into treating the physiognomy of the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and devoted the most ardent study\r\nto the weapons, costumes, and furniture of those epochs. They never\r\nwearied in representing François I and Henri IV in the most varied\r\nsituations of life, nor in searching the biographies of great artists\r\nand scholars for episodes worth painting. Especially popular subjects\r\nwere those of celebrated painters at their meeting with contemporaries\r\nof high station: Raphael and Michael Angelo coming across each other in\r\nthe Vatican, Murillo as a boy, the young Ribera found drawing in the\r\nstreet by a Cardinal, Bellini in his studio amid all manner of precious\r\nobjects, Charles V and Titian, Michael Angelo tending his servant, and\r\nothers of the same kind. The number of painters who were active in this\r\nprovince is as great as the number of anecdotes which are told of\r\ndistinguished men. They spread themselves over various countries, like\r\nthe swarms of insects hatched on a summer's day amid luxuriant\r\nvegetation, and thereby they render the task of selection more difficult\r\nto the historian. In France there worked _Alexander Hesse_, _Camille\r\nRoqueplan_, and _Charles Comte_; in Belgium, _Alexander Markelbach_ and\r\n_Florent Willems_. Markelbach, a pupil of Wappers, in addition to\r\nepisodes from English history, specially devoted himself to painting the\r\nshooting festivals of the old Netherlandish city guards, in which\r\nenterprise the Doelen pieces of Frans Hals did him excellent service in\r\nthe matter of costume. Florent Willems, who, as a restorer, saturated\r\nhimself with the manner of the old masters, was particularly popular on\r\naccount of the smooth finish he gave to his modish ladies, cavaliers,\r\nsoldiers, painters, soubrettes, and patrician matrons of the sixteenth\r\nand seventeenth centuries. All the richly coloured satin, brocade, and\r\nvelvet costumes of these personages, together with the tapestry, the\r\ncurtains, and the furniture of their dwellings, he had the secret of\r\nreproducing in such a fashion that he was long esteemed a modern\r\nTerborg. Amongst the Germans, _L. von Hagn_ was the most delicate of\r\nthese artists, and the graceful comedies of real life which he painted,\r\ntransplanting them into the Italian Renaissance or the French _rococo_\r\nperiod, have often great distinction of colouring. _Gustav Spangenberg_,\r\nafter the lucky but isolated success he had made with \"The Track of\r\nDeath,\" devoted himself to the Reformation period; and _Carl Becker_ to\r\nthe Venetian Renaissance, from which he occasionally made an excursion\r\ninto the German. These and many others could be discussed with more\r\nparticularity if their pictures, smooth as coloured prints, and neatly\r\nfinished in their own paltry way, were not so much below the standard of\r\ngalleries. For them also the incident to be represented, with the\r\npersonages concerned in it, was the principal matter, and not pure\r\npainting. These fetters upon true art were first shaken off by the hands\r\nof the following painters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  GÉRÔME.   THE COCK-FIGHT.]\r\n\r\nOf the generation of the eminent Flemish artists of 1830 _Hendrik Leys_\r\nis the one whose fame has been most enduring. Born in Antwerp on 18th\r\nFebruary 1815, at first destined for the priesthood, and then in 1829\r\nadmitted to the studio of Ferdinand de Braekeleers, he had made his\r\ndébut in the beginning of the thirties with a pair of historical\r\npictures. These indeed revealed little of the power which he evinced\r\nlater, but they furnished some indication of what he was aiming at. Here\r\nwere none of the skirmishes--so popular at the time--in which blood\r\nflows as from the pipes of a fountain; the combatants fought with\r\ndecorum and moderation, and less from conviction than to justify the\r\nhelmets and cuirasses which had been fetched from the wardrobe. In both\r\nof them, on the other hand, the background--a mediæval town with\r\ntortuous alleys, lanterns, and picturesque taverns--was most lovingly\r\ntreated. Here was revealed a thoroughly German delight in minute detail.\r\nInstead of subordinating the accessories as others did, with the object\r\nof throwing the principal personages into relief, Leys represented an\r\nentire corner of the world at once, giving full distinctness to the\r\nsmallest things, down to the implements of daily life, the grasses and\r\nflowers of the landscape, and the variegated corner-stones of the old\r\nhouse-fronts, whose picturesque porches and lattices bulge into the\r\ncrooked lanes. His next picture, \"The Massacre of the Löwen\r\nMagistrates,\" was a still further departure from precedent, since--quite\r\nin Callot's manner--it mingled with the principal drama a mass of\r\ngrotesque episodes. The born _genre_ painter was announced by these\r\ntraits; and not less striking was the form of the art, which was a\r\nthorough departure from the manner of the \"painters of the grand style.\"\r\n\r\nThe resuscitation of a national art, which had been the life-long aim of\r\nGustav Wappers, who was twelve years his senior, was what Leys also set\r\nup as the goal of his artistic endeavours. But their ways divided.\r\nWappers was principally inspired by Rubens, while Leys attached himself\r\nat first to the Dutch painters. A visit made to Amsterdam in 1839 had\r\nhelped him to an understanding of Rembrandt and Pieter de Hoogh. He\r\nfollowed them when, in 1845, he painted his \"Wedding in the Seventeenth\r\nCentury\"--a rich display of gleaming hangings, golden plate, and\r\nred-plush furniture, amid which move handsomely dressed people, wedding\r\nguests, and violin players. The effort to approach Pieter de Hoogh or\r\nJan van der Meer is apparent in the management of light; the treatment\r\nof drapery reminds one of Mieris and Metsu. Another pair of anecdotic\r\npictures from the seventeenth century allow one to follow the progress\r\nby which Leys, under the influence of Dutch models, gradually developed\r\nthat power and mastery of colouring, that completeness of pictorial\r\neffect, and that soft treatment of subdued light which were justly\r\nadmired in his first works. In particular, certain works founded on the\r\nlegends of painters and monarchs--Rubens, Rembrandt, or Frans Floris\r\nvisited in their studio by some personage of high station--made him the\r\nlion of the Paris Salon. In 1852 he stood at the summit of his fame; he\r\nwas recognised as one of the first of painters, both in Belgium and in\r\nother countries, and was everywhere loaded with honours. Then he cast\r\nhis slough and entered on his \"second manner.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  HENDRIK LEYS.]\r\n\r\nAfter he had followed Rembrandt for more than a decade he turned from\r\nhim to cast himself suddenly into the arms of the German masters of the\r\nsixteenth century, and, according to his own saying, \"from that time\r\nforward to become an artist.\" During a tour through Germany, in 1852, he\r\nhad become familiar with Dürer and Cranach; in Dresden, Wittenberg, and\r\nEisenach there hovered round him the great figures of the Reformation\r\nperiod. Half-effaced memories of his countrymen, the brothers Van Eyck\r\nand Quentin Matsys, became once more fresh, and drove him decisively\r\nforward on his new course. \"The Festival at Otto Venius's\" and \"Erasmus\r\nin his Study\" were the first steps in this direction, and when soon\r\nafterwards he came forward with his costume pictures, \"Luther as a\r\nChorister in Eisenach\" and \"Luther in his Household at Wittenberg,\"\r\nevery one was enraptured with the exquisite truthfulness of his\r\nportrayal of archaic life. At the World's Exhibition of 1855 he had\r\nanother magnificent success with three pictures executed in old German\r\nstyle. These were \"The Mass in Honour of the Antwerp Burgomaster Barthel\r\nde Haze,\" \"The Walk before the Gate,\" and \"New Year's Day in Flanders.\"\r\nHis return from Paris, where he was the only foreigner except Cornelius\r\nwho had received the great gold medal, took the form of a triumphal\r\nprogress in Antwerp, where he was greeted with illuminations, torchlight\r\nprocessions, and laurel wreaths made in gold. He was held to be the most\r\neminent master since Quentin Matsys, the Jan van Eyck of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. In the Brussels Salon he appeared as a prince of art, before\r\nwhom criticism made obeisance, and for whose pictures special shrines\r\nwere erected. He was striking, not merely as an artist, but as a man:\r\nhis stately figure was known to every one in Antwerp, and was pointed\r\nout to strangers as one of the sights of the place. In 1867, when he\r\nagain received the medal in Paris, the Antwerp Cercle Artistique had a\r\nmedal struck to commemorate an event of such importance in Belgian art.\r\nHis decease, on 25th August 1869, threw the whole town into mourning;\r\nthe windows in the town hall, where he had painted his last pictures,\r\nwere hung with black, and the announcement of his death pasted up on\r\ngreat placards at the street corners. \"_Leys is ons_\" ran the phrase in\r\nthe speech made by the burgomaster over his open grave. To-day his\r\nstatue stands on the Boulevard Leys, and his house is noted down in\r\nBaedecker, like those of Matsys and Floris, Rubens and Jordaens.\r\n\r\nLeys was thus a favourite child of fortune. Enthusiastic applause\r\nshowered him with fame and laurels. But it is natural that posterity\r\nshould find a good deal to cancel in these titles of honour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  LEYS.   A FAMILY FESTIVAL.]\r\n\r\nThrough Leys the history of art was not enriched with anything new. His\r\ndelicate art--severe in outline--which goes back directly to the\r\npeculiar manner of the fifteenth century, is in itself not without\r\nmerit. But how much of it belongs to the nineteenth century? To what\r\nextent has the painter stood independent and on his own peculiar ground?\r\nHe could draw a Van Eyck which might be taken for an original. He seems\r\nlike an old master gone astray by chance amongst the moderns. His\r\nknowledge of the sixteenth century is marvellous. In fact, he was a\r\nvisionary who saw the past as clearly as though he had lived in the\r\nmidst of it. The men he paints are his contemporaries. He has drawn them\r\nfrom life in the year of grace 1493, and they make no gesture nor\r\ngrimace which might not be four hundred years old. Yet that means that\r\nhe was not an original genius, but merely one who gave an adroit\r\nreproduction of a formula already in existence. And much as he affected\r\nto be the contemporary of Lucas Cranach and Quentin Matsys, he had not\r\ntheir simplicity: where they painted life he painted the shadow of their\r\nrealism. Surrounded by old pictures, breviaries, and missals, he\r\ncontented himself with copying the still forms of Gothic miniatures\r\ninstead of living nature. He went so deeply into the pictures of the\r\nAntwerp town hall that he followed the old masters in their very errors\r\nof perspective; and though even the most childish confusion between\r\nforeground and background does not disturb one's pleasure in them,\r\nbecause they knew no better, it is an affectation in him, with his\r\nmodern knowledge, intentionally to make the same mistakes. Instead of\r\nbeing an imitator of nature, he is an imitator of their imitation--a\r\n_gourmet_ in pictorial archaism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEYS.   THE ARMOURER.]\r\n\r\nYet it was exactly this uncompromising archaism which was of importance\r\nfor his time, and amongst his contemporaries it gives him significance\r\nas a reformer. He is the only one amongst them who really represents the\r\nFlemish race. Wappers was merely a Fleming from Paris, who shook off the\r\nyoke of the Greeks to bear that of the French. Delaroche lived again in\r\nLouis Gallait, the pupil of David. Their works had the sentiment of\r\nFrench tragedies, and an artificial neatness which completely departed\r\nfrom the truth of nature; the figures were combed and washed and brushed\r\nand polished, the gestures were histrionic, the colours toned in a\r\nstereotyped fashion to effect a pleasing _ensemble_. Leys endeavoured to\r\nbe true. In his pictures he had no wish to express ideas, but merely to\r\nbring back a fragment of \"the good old time\" in all its brightness of\r\nlife and colour. And whilst as a colourist he was bent upon avoiding\r\nuniformity of tone and giving everything its natural character, as a\r\ndraughtsman, too, he set up, in opposition to the more patrician fluency\r\nof others, the citizen-like angularity of an art uninfluenced by the\r\nCinquecento. As in Cranach, Dürer, and Holbein, one finds in his\r\npictures profiles that are vividly true; harsh and often unwieldy heads,\r\nwrinkled faces, and heavy, massive shoulders resting on stunted bodies.\r\nThe human form, with fat stomach and great horny hands, seems almost\r\ndeformed. Everything which the struggle for existence has made of the\r\nimage of God is expressed in the works of Leys for the first time since\r\nDavid. Even his \"Massacre of the Löwen Magistrates\" showed sharp,\r\nnaturalistic physiognomies in the midst of its confused composition, and\r\nhis \"Barthel de Haze,\" fifteen years after, fully exemplified this\r\nstriving after characteristic and truthful expression. None of his\r\ncontemporaries has shown himself more cool and indifferent to\r\nconventional and graceful profile and \"beauty\" in the drawing of heads.\r\nHatred of the academic model made Leys bring art back to its sources.\r\nThe hideousness, so often childish, in primitive pictures was dearer to\r\nhim than all Raphael. By this emphasising of the characteristic in\r\nattitude and the expression of the face he shows himself, although he\r\npainted historical subjects, the very antipode of the painter of the\r\nhistorical school, and, at the same time, one of those who effected the\r\ntransition which led to the modern style. In setting up quaintness and\r\nfar-fetched archaism against the mannerism of the idealists, Leys\r\naccustomed the eye again to recognise that there was something truer\r\nthan nobility of line and aristocratic pose; and, as he appealed to the\r\nold masters as accomplices, it was impossible for æsthetic criticism to\r\nbe offended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEYS.   MOTHER AND CHILD.]\r\n\r\nIn France the transition from the absolutely beautiful to the\r\ncharacteristic, from types to individuals, was brought about from\r\nvarious sides. On the one side Romanticism had opposed to the antique\r\nstyle that of the Flemish painters. On the other side, within Classicism\r\nitself, there had been a change from the antique and the Cinquecento to\r\nthe early Italian renaissance. A new world was opened to sculpture by\r\nthe \"Florentine Singer\" of Paul Dubois. The more artists buried\r\nthemselves in the study of those early pioneers of realism, Donatello,\r\nVerrochio, della Robbia, and the other masters of the Quatrocento, the\r\nmore they found themselves fascinated by the sparkling animation of\r\nthese creations, and sought to transfer it freely into their own work.\r\nThe fifteenth century, with the energetic force of its figures, its\r\nclose grasp of nature, and its pithy characterisation, which did not\r\neven shrink from ugliness, induced painters to go back more than they\r\nhad formerly done to the sources of real life and to bring something of\r\nits directness into their creations. Élie Delaunay began to look on\r\nnature with an eye less bent on making abstractions and regarding all\r\nthings from the standpoint of style; he began to apprehend more clearly\r\nher individual peculiarities and to reproduce them more truly than had\r\nbeen done by the frigid school which cast everything into the mould of\r\nClassicism. But _Ernest_ _Meissonier_ went a step further when by his\r\n_rococo_ pictures he set the Dutch tradition on a level with the Flemish\r\nand Early Italian as a formative influence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  MEISSONIER.   THE MAN AT THE WINDOW.]\r\n\r\nA picture must either be very big or very small if it is to attract\r\nattention amid the bustle of exhibitions. This was probably the\r\nconsideration which led Meissonier to his peculiar class of subjects,\r\nand induced him to come forward with minute Netherlandish cabinet-pieces\r\nat the time when the Romanticists were issuing their huge manifestoes.\r\nHe came of a family of petty tradespeople, and in his youth he is said\r\nto have taken over his father's business, a trade in colonial produce.\r\nEvery morning at eight o'clock punctual he was at the shop desk, and\r\nkept the books and copied business letters, and in this way accustomed\r\nhimself to that painstaking and uniform carefulness which was\r\ncharacteristic of him to the end of his life. His teacher, Cogniet, was\r\nwithout influence on him. Even in his youth, when there went forth the\r\nbattle-cry of \"A Guelf, a Ghibelline! A Delacroix, an Ingres!\"\r\nMeissonier sat quietly in the Louvre and copied Jan van Eyck's Madonna\r\nfrom Autun. And a Netherlandish \"little master\" did he remain all his\r\ndays. He first earned his bread as an illustrator, but after 1834 he\r\nbegan to exhibit all manner of pieces from the time of Louis XIV and\r\nLouis XV--the \"Bourgeois hollandais rendant Visite au Bourgmestre\" of\r\n1834, the \"Chess Players of Holbein's Time,\" 1835, the \"Monk at the\r\nSickbed,\" 1838, the \"English Doctor\" and the \"Man Reading,\" 1840. The\r\nSalon of 1841 was for him what that of 1824 had been for Delacroix and\r\nIngres, and that of 1831 for Delaroche: the cradle of his fame. \"The\r\nChess Party\" (17 cm. high and 11 cm. broad) was the most celebrated\r\npicture of the exhibition. The great Netherlandish \"little masters\" of\r\nthe seventeenth century, till then scarcely known and little\r\nappreciated, were brought out for comparison. \"Has Terborg or Mieris or\r\nMeissonier done the greater work?\" was the question. People marvelled at\r\nthe sharpness of this short-sighted eye which had a perception for the\r\nsmallest details. \"Good heavens! look at the way that's been done,\" said\r\nthe Philistine, taking a magnifying glass; and felt himself a\r\nconnoisseur if the curator at his elbow called out, \"Not too near!\" Even\r\nhis first pictures had an accuracy and finish which defies description.\r\nIt seemed as if a most admirable Netherlandish painter in miniature\r\nscale had arisen. The execution of his design in colours was as slow,\r\ncareful, and laborious as were his preparatory studies for costume:\r\nevery touch was altered and altered again; many a picture which was\r\nalmost ready was thrown aside, scraped out, and completely recast. Not\r\nhot-headed enthusiasts, but \"connoisseurs,\" has Meissonier conquered in\r\nthis fashion. Those readers, philosophers, card-players, drinkers,\r\nsmokers, flute-players and violin-players, engravers, painters and\r\namateurs, horsemen and farm-servants, brawlers and bravoes, from the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which he painted year after year,\r\nwere soon the most coveted pictures in every superior private\r\ncollection. In 1884 he was able to celebrate his jubilee as an artist\r\nwith an exhibition of one hundred and fifty pictures of the kind. And as\r\nthey would have gone dirt cheap if they had been bought for their weight\r\nin gold, the public accustomed itself to buy them for their weight in\r\nthousand-franc notes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  MEISSONIER.   A MAN READING.]\r\n\r\nThe present age no longer looks up to these exercises of patience with\r\nthe same vast admiration, but it should not therefore be forgotten what\r\nMeissonier was for his time.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, though painted at a time when painting was regarded as an\r\nauxiliary, and an invaluable one, to history, his pictures tell no\r\nstory. These personages of Meissonier's take part in no comedy; they\r\noccupy themselves, some in smoking, some in drinking, others in playing\r\ncards, and others again in doing nothing whatever. Whether they made\r\ntheir entry as musketeer or philosophers, as lackeys or gallants, as\r\nscholars or _bonvivants_, they did not pose and had no ambition to seem\r\nmen of wit and spirit, they plunged into no adventurous deeds and\r\nrelated no anecdotes: they were content to be well painted. And so\r\namongst all the French painters of the historical picture of manners\r\nMeissonier was the one who had the secret of giving his works an\r\nentirely peculiar _cachet_ of striking and realistic truth to nature.\r\nHis figures, marvellously painted, and at the same time animated and\r\nnatural in expression, wear the costume of our ancestors with the utmost\r\nself-possession, and fit into their modish _rococo_ surroundings as if\r\nthey had been poured into a mould. Meissonier reached the truth of\r\nnature in the total effect of his pictures by first in reality arranging\r\nhis interiors, and the still-life they contained, as a congruous whole.\r\nThe rooms, window niches, and firesides which he reproduced in his\r\npictures were in his own house and his studios, with every detail ready\r\nto hand. He bought bronzes, trinkets, and ornaments, genuine productions\r\nof the _rococo_ period, by the hundred thousand, and kept them by him.\r\nHis models were obliged, for weeks and often for months, actually to\r\nwear the velvet and silken costumes in which he made use of them; then\r\nhe painted them with the greatest fidelity to nature, and without\r\ntroubling himself about anecdotic incident. What he rendered was not a\r\nstory invented and put together piecemeal, but a wholesome piece of\r\nreality, pictorially conceived. And if this was primarily composed of\r\ncostumes and furniture belonging to the eighteenth century, the\r\ntransition to the natural treatment of modern life was at the same time\r\nmade possible, and was accomplished by Meissonier himself, at a later\r\nperiod, in his battle pieces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  MEISSONIER.   READING THE MANUSCRIPT.]\r\n\r\nBut he had only painted men: the physiognomy of the feminine Sphinx\r\nremained for him an eternal riddle. A wide field was here offered to his\r\nfollowers. Fauvelet, Chavet, and Brillouin stepped into Meissonier's\r\nshoes, and gave his _rococo_ fine gentlemen their better halves. The\r\nfirst two made simple imitations. Brillouin devoted himself to the comic\r\n_genre_: he arranged his pictures prettily, was a good observer, and\r\npainted tolerably well. The last of these Meissonierists is Vibert,\r\nchiefly known in the present day by his cardinals and other scarlet\r\ndignitaries, whom he represents in water-colours and oils with a certain\r\ntouch of malice. He paints them gouty, gluttonising, or tipsy, in one or\r\nmore cases in every picture--which does not contribute to make his works\r\ninteresting. But originally he had a sympathetic superior talent, and\r\nwill always claim a modest place in the group of the modern \"little\r\nmasters.\" His \"Gulliver Bound,\" and also the Spanish and Turkish scenes\r\nwhich occupied him after a tour in the East, are extremely pleasing and\r\ndelicately painted costume pieces, gleaming in sunlight; and in their\r\nsparkling, capricious workmanship they sometimes almost verge on\r\nFortuny.\r\n\r\nOn the German side of the Rhine _Adolf Menzel_ was the great pioneer of\r\ntruth. The history of German art must do him honour as one who first had\r\nthe genius and courage to break away from conventional forms of\r\nphrasing, and bring the truth of nature into art: at first, as in the\r\ncase of Meissonier, it was nature in masquerade; but it was nature seen\r\nand rendered with all the sincerity of a man to whom the art of pose was\r\nwanting from the very first.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  MEISSONIER.   POLCINELLO.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L'Art._\r\n\r\n  MEISSONIER.   A READING AT DIDEROT'S.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Baron Edmond de Rothschild, owner of the picture,\r\n  and of M. Georges Petit, owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nEven in the thirties, at a time when \"The Sorrowing Royal Pair\" and the\r\n\"Leonora\" by Lessing, \"The Soldier and his Child,\" \"The Sick Councillor,\"\r\nand \"The Sons of Edward\" by Hildebrandt, and \"The Lament of the Jews\" by\r\nBendemann, together with the works of Cornelius, met with the enthusiastic\r\napplause of the million, Menzel looked into the world with a sharp glance,\r\nundisturbed by idealism; and what enabled him to do this was his\r\nunwavering and thoroughly Prussian healthiness, which knew no touch of\r\nsentimentalism--a certain coldness and hardness, that sensible, reflective\r\nNorth German trait, which often expresses itself in these days (when\r\nGerman art has become subtle and superior) by a crude naturalism in the\r\nBerlin painting. In the beginning of the century, however, it set the\r\nBerlin painting, as art of the healthy human understanding, in salutary\r\ncontrast to the sickliness of Munich and Düsseldorf. Even eighty years ago\r\nthe people of Berlin were too acute and practical to be Romanticists. The\r\nartists whom Menzel found active and honoured at his arrival were Schadow\r\nand Rauch, and beside them, as representatives of the _grande peinture_,\r\nBegas and Wach. But even these, who were most under the influence of the\r\nsentimental tendency, were justly recognised by the thorough-going\r\nRomanticists on the Rhine as never having given an unqualified homage to\r\ntheir flag. A clear, realistic method was dominant in the art of Berlin.\r\nAnd in this respect it was as much a corrective--and one by no means to be\r\nundervalued--against the inflated sentiment of Munich as against the weak\r\nand sickly sentimentalism of Düsseldorf, with its knights and monks and\r\nnoble maidens. Even Cornelius, who had been called to Berlin by Frederick\r\nWilliam IV--that King of the Romanticists on the throne of the eminently\r\nunromantic Hohenzollerns--found himself helpless against the ruling taste.\r\nAnd here only, in the stronghold of sharply accentuated common sense,\r\nwhere the old Prussian sobriety set bounds to the twilight kingdom of\r\nRomanticism, could Adolf Menzel attain to greatness. His Berlinism kept\r\nhim from lingering in empty space. To the taste of to-day, formed from\r\nFontainebleau, he will seem too much a creature of the understanding and\r\ntoo little a creature of feeling. Boecklin hit him off admirably when, on\r\nbeing asked what he thought of Menzel, he answered: \"He is a great\r\nscholar.\" A comparison between him and Mommsen especially suggests\r\nitself--a great scholar, a mordant satirist, and a brilliant journalist.\r\nBut this sober scepticism, this cool spirit of investigation, this\r\n\"heartlessness\" observing all things with the eye of a judge in a court of\r\njudicial inquiry, were what cleared the ground for modern art. No one has\r\ndone more than Menzel for those rulers in the kingdom of dreams who from\r\npure dreaming have never been able to learn anything. He has helped to set\r\nthem steadily on their feet, and to accustom their sight, vitiated by\r\nidealism, once more to truth and nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L'Art._\r\n\r\n  MEISSONIER.   A HALT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mansell._\r\n\r\n  MEISSONIER.   A CAVALIER.]\r\n\r\nMenzel was almost the only one in Germany who could draw and paint in\r\nthe time before the French influence had made itself felt. The struggle\r\nfor existence had forced him to learn. In the year of Bismarck's birth\r\nthere was born in Breslau the man destined to glorify, first the\r\ngreatness of the old kingdom of the Fredericks, and then that of new\r\nimperial Prussia. Cast out at an early age on the inhospitable\r\nwilderness of life, he came to Berlin, poor and lonely, and not so much\r\nfor the sake of art as for gain. There he sat in his cheerless attic,\r\nwithout a servant; and wrapped up in his plaid, with a coffee-pot on one\r\nside and a pencil on the other, he looked out over the roofs of the vast\r\ntown, the most brilliant epoch of which he was predestined to depict and\r\nto conquer by his art. Since it brought in profit sooner than anything\r\nelse, he had made himself familiar with the technique of reproduction;\r\nand having devoted himself in particular to the newly discovered art of\r\nlithography, he turned out _ménus_, New Year cards, vignettes for\r\noccasional poems, etc., and in things of this sort displayed a genuine\r\naffinity of spirit with Chodowiecki and Gottfried Schadow. From his\r\ntwelfth year onwards he had not only assured his own existence, but even\r\nsupported his family by such work; and in the hours he spent over it he\r\nlaid the groundwork for becoming the master of masters amongst the\r\nmoderns. Menzel is not merely a man who owed to himself everything which\r\nhe afterwards became, who learnt to draw by his own unassisted\r\nendeavours, who mastered oil-painting without a teacher, and went\r\nfurther in it than any one of his generation--a man who found out\r\nentirely by himself new methods and combinations in water-colours and\r\ngouache; but if it is asked who was the greatest German illustrator, the\r\nman who did most in Germany to advance the art of woodcut engraving, the\r\none German historical painter of the century who was entirely original,\r\nwho really knew a bygone period so exactly that he could venture on\r\npainting it, the name of Menzel is invariably uttered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  ADOLF MENZEL, 1837.]\r\n\r\nEven in the twelve simple lithographs which appeared in 1837, \"Memorable\r\nEvents from Prussian History in the Brandenburg Era,\" the \"scholar\"\r\nMenzel stands ready as the actual historian of the Prussian kingdom. In\r\nan age which took its pleasure in a vaporous, sentimental enthusiasm for\r\nthe mediæval splendour of the empire, he was the one who as a youth of\r\ntwenty pointed to the corner-stones of Prussian history in the\r\nBrandenburg times; he was the only man of his age who refused to blow\r\nthe horn of the mawkish Romanticists, and still less that of the\r\nimpassioned historical painters who came after them. For his were no\r\ntheatrically tricked out scenes of tragedy, no touching situations; they\r\nhad nothing poetical; and just as little were they tedious pictures of\r\nceremonies or spectacular pieces. Striking characterisation and\r\nsparkling vividness were united here to the most painstaking study of\r\nnature and history, carried down to the peculiarities of costume and\r\nweapons. History was not arranged in accordance with academic formulæ,\r\nbut delineated as if from life with absorbing truthfulness. Everything\r\nwas expressed simply and sincerely, without exciting passages, and\r\nwithout conventional sentiment pumped out of models. Every epoch had its\r\nhistorical physiognomy, and costume was reduced to its proper\r\nsubordinate place.\r\n\r\nFranz Kugler was the first who understood this sincere and pithy art.\r\n\r\nThe Life of Napoleon had appeared, at that time, in Paris, with\r\nillustrations by Horace Vernet, and it had a considerable sale in\r\nGermany also. This gave a Berlin publisher the idea of a similar German\r\nwork, and Kugler commissioned Menzel to illustrate his biography of\r\nFrederick the Great. It is almost impossible to pay sufficient honour to\r\nthe influence which this book on Frederick has had on German art. It\r\nmade an epoch in the history of wood engraving. The technique of this\r\ncraft had been completely forgotten in Germany ever since the beginning\r\nof the century, or used only for the production of rough trade-marks for\r\ntobacco; Menzel had to invent it afresh and teach an engraving school of\r\nhis own before the four hundred masterly plates of the book were made\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nBut it became more revolutionary still for the æsthetic ideas of the\r\ntime. Menzel had not set himself to produce a sequence of pictures,\r\ndisplaying events and heroes in the most ideal situations possible, but\r\nmade it his business to sift the entire life of Frederick the Great to\r\nits minutest particulars. And here began that philological study of\r\nrecords which Menzel has carried on with the strenuous labour of an\r\narchivist down to the present day. Old Fritz had been caught by\r\nChodowiecki in the way in which he has since lived in the popular\r\nimagination: as the old man on horseback, with his bent shoulders and\r\nhis crutch-stick, holding a review, and as the philosopher, the\r\nstatesman, the warrior and hero in the most manifold situations. Menzel,\r\nin whom the spirit of Chodowiecki lived again, only needed to begin\r\nwhere the latter left off. Stepping on the antiquarian material of\r\nChodowiecki, he worked his way into the great period on which Frederick\r\nand Voltaire have set the stamp of their spirit, as Mommsen worked his\r\nway into Roman history. He read through whole libraries; he copied all\r\nattainable portraits. With scientific pedantry he did not forget to\r\nstudy the buttons and the cut of the trousers in the uniforms, and did\r\nnot rest until he knew the old grenadiers as a corporal knows his men.\r\nUsing these labours as preparation, he proceeded to call up old Fritz\r\nand his time with the objectivity of an historian, just as they were,\r\nand not as they had better have been. Sureness of treatment even in the\r\nfinest details, accurate mastery of the surroundings, and everything\r\nwhich had made Meissonier's appearance so important for France, was\r\nattained at one stroke for Germany. But the very simplicity of what was\r\noffered--both in style and technique--prevented Menzel from being at the\r\nbeginning accepted in his own country as an \"historical painter.\" He was\r\nblamed for disregarding \"beauty,\" and it was said that a \"higher\"\r\nartistic perception was sealed from him. On the other hand, the book\r\nlaid the foundation of Menzel's position in France, and was, moreover,\r\nthe work on which, for a long time, the appreciation of modern German\r\nart in foreign countries was based.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MENZEL.   FREDERICK THE GREAT AND HIS TUTOR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MENZEL.   THE ROUND TABLE AT SANS-SOUCI.]\r\n\r\nThenceforth Menzel had a kind of monopoly in this subject, and when in\r\n1840 Frederick William IV had the works of the great king published in\r\nan _édition de luxe_, Menzel, amongst others, was entrusted with the\r\nillustration. Every one of the thirty volumes contains portraits of\r\nFrederick's contemporaries which were engraved by Mandel and others\r\nafter original pictures of the period. Menzel had an apparently\r\nsubordinate task. He was commissioned to make two hundred drawings for\r\nwood engraving; these, however, do not appear on separate pages, but\r\nwere destined to be incorporated in the text as tail-pieces, vignettes,\r\nand the like. This was the great work which occupied him during the\r\nforties; and in these headings and tail-pieces to the works of Frederick\r\nthe Great he showed, for the first time, that he was not merely a\r\nlearned investigator of sources, but was full of brilliant _aperçus_.\r\nOne has to read Frederick the Great before one can do full justice to\r\nthe acuteness and ready resource, the subtlety and pungency of the\r\nartist's pencil. All æsthetic categories of realistic and idealistic art\r\nare scattered like dust before these creations, in which the most\r\nfantastic ideas are embodied with the whole force of the realistic power\r\nof our days.\r\n\r\nWhen he had done honour to the military comrades of the great ruler in\r\nhis work of wood engraving, \"Heroes of War and Peace in the Time of King\r\nFrederick,\" and thus made the epoch his own through a decade of busy\r\nlabour, Menzel, draughtsman though he was, turned round and became the\r\npainter of Frederick the Great. In the history of art there have never\r\nbeen two names more intimately connected with each other. Menzel was a\r\nstrenuous worker, who never knew the passion for woman, either because\r\nhe had no time for it, or because he despised women after being despised\r\nby them as a poor, hard-featured student of art; a man whose great bald\r\nhead appeared at Berlin subscription-balls amid groups of brilliant\r\ncavaliers and queens of beauty, fashion, and grace, surrounded by the\r\nrustle of their silks and in the whirlpool of a dancing throng, gleaming\r\nwith colour and sparkling with gold and jewels; and appeared there\r\nsimply because this world interested him as something to be painted. He\r\nwas a recluse who went into society solely to make observations for his\r\nart, and when there was chary of speech and much feared. He was always a\r\nbusy experimentalist, so that his two hands gradually became equally\r\ndexterous; at the age of eighty he could still sketch with firm and\r\naccurate strokes while travelling in a railway carriage.\r\n\r\nThough he had hitherto devoted himself to drawing, he had also by his\r\nown independent study made himself familiar with the technique of oils;\r\nand he now became such a master of colour as few were at that time. In\r\nthe middle of the century were painted those two masterpieces which now\r\nhang in the Berlin National Gallery, \"The Round Table at Sans-Souci\" and\r\n\"The Concert of Frederick the Great.\" These are historical pictures, the\r\nauthority and importance of which cannot be shaken by even the most\r\nmodern of critics. If what is called the spirit of an age has ever been\r\nembodied in pictures, it is embodied here, where the master-minds of the\r\neighteenth century are assembled at their genial round table. The scene\r\nis the oval dining-room of the castle. The meal is over, and there\r\nreigns a genial after-dinner mood, champagne sparkles in the glasses and\r\na smart rivalry of wit is in progress. Afternoon has crept on, and a\r\ncold, subdued daylight floods the room, in which every fragment of the\r\narchitecture, from the inlaid floor to the gilded capitals of the\r\npillars and the stucco of the arched ceiling, every piece of furniture\r\nand every chandelier, bears the wayward grace of the high-_rococo_\r\nperiod; all is comprehended with the most intimate knowledge. In the\r\nsecond picture a fine candlelight is glimmering over the scene.\r\nFrederick is just beginning to play the flute, and the musicians of the\r\nstring quartet pause, to strike in again after the solo. The Court is\r\ngrouped to the left: the ladies in gilded easy-chairs, and their\r\ncavaliers behind them. The tapers of the chandelier and the sconces\r\nbranching from the wall shed over everything their prismatic, broken\r\nlight reflected by the mirrors, and fill the fantastic, capricious,\r\ngraceful, comfortable apartment, here with streaming brightness, there\r\nwith a finely modulated twilight. Only Menzel could have conjured up in\r\nso convincing a manner the brilliancy of this Court festival of the\r\npast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstängl._\r\n\r\n  MENZEL.   FREDERICK THE GREAT ON A JOURNEY.]\r\n\r\nHere is that exactness which an historical picture must have if it makes\r\nany claim to intrinsic worth. Whilst the ordinary historical painters\r\nwere content to transmute dressed-up models into types of the\r\nuniversally human, and to put historical labels on their frames, Menzel\r\nsucceeded in really penetrating a bygone age in an artistic spirit, and\r\nin making it live again for the present generation. He did not burrow to\r\ndiscover another dim historical personage every year, but confined\r\nhimself to one hero--to the figure of the Prussian hero-king, familiar\r\nto every child, and still living in the popular imagination; and he\r\nlearnt to master the time of this favourite hero as if he had been old\r\nFritz himself. Menzel had never heard him blowing on his flute, and\r\nnever sat at table with him in Sans-Souci, but the painting of these\r\nscenes comes out true and life-like in the artist's work, because the\r\npast history of his country had become as vivid to him as his own age.\r\nHis \"Battle of Hochkirch\" rises to tragical grandeur, precisely because\r\neverything that is outwardly impassioned is far from him. His \"Frederick\r\nthe Great on a Journey,\" where the king is inspecting territories alter\r\nthe war and ordering the rebuilding of demolished houses, his\r\n\"Frederick's Meeting with Joseph II in Niesse,\" and all the other\r\npictures of the sequence, by their marvellous naturalness and intense\r\nvividness, and by their freedom from pompous phrasing, stand alone in an\r\nage dominated by empty sentiment. Menzel, who never laid his sketch-book\r\ndown from the time he was twelve years old, found a subject of pictorial\r\ninterest in everything that he saw around him, until finally he acquired\r\nthe power of moving with natural self-possession in a period that was\r\nnot his own. By the roundabout way through the _rococo_ period he has\r\ntaught us to understand ourselves. In his pictures an apparently\r\nparadoxical problem has been solved. An intense feeling for modern\r\nreality waked to new life the past, that same past which no one had\r\napproached with success by the way of idealism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MENZEL.   ILLUSTRATION TO KUGLER'S HISTORY OF FREDERICK\r\n  THE GREAT.]\r\n\r\nAnd if we look over the whole development of modern art it strikes us as\r\na remarkable fact that the most concrete spirits, the most thorough\r\nmasters of technique, like Meissonier and Menzel, were precisely those\r\nwho ventured to advance into the present. When they had crossed the\r\nprovince of the _rococo_ period, avoided by all scholastic art, they had\r\narrived again at the epoch when Mengs and David had interrupted the\r\nnatural course of the history of art, one hundred years before. About\r\n1750 the fateful movement towards the antique had been accomplished; in\r\n1820 the Middle Ages had the upper hand; in 1830 the Cinquecento was in\r\nthe ascendant with Cornelius and Ingres; in 1840 the seventeenth century\r\nwas awakened through Delacroix and Wappers; and in 1850, after \"the\r\ncourses of the centuries were sphered\"--to use the phrase of\r\nCornelius--Meissonier and Menzel painted things which had not appeared\r\nworth representing to the painters of 1750, blinded, as they were, by\r\nthe glory of the antique. Not less striking is it that the nearer the\r\nhistorical subject came to the present the truer to nature did the\r\npicture become, and the more did it outwardly change in its features. It\r\nhas shrivelled from the huge scale of David and Cornelius to the\r\nminiature scale of Meissonier and Menzel, and to some extent it thus\r\nleaves its further development to be guessed. At no distant time the\r\nhistorical picture will be overthrown, and the picture from modern life,\r\nhitherto but shyly handled and on the smallest scale, will swell to life\r\nsize. History itself, serious history, clings merely to the rock-bed of\r\nold costume. One generation had used it with an abstract purpose as a\r\nsubstratum for philosophical ideas; others had made scenical pieces with\r\nits aid; a third generation turned it over for piquant traits and\r\nanecdotes. The last and greatest generation had finally come to handle\r\nit quite familiarly and humanly and without affected dignity. Their\r\nworks protested against all idealism; and this expressed itself, in\r\ndrawing, by their making use of the true instead of the \"beautiful\"\r\nline; in colour, by a fresher tint corresponding with nature rather than\r\nwith the conventional ideal of beauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MENZEL.   PORTRAIT OF FREDERICK THE GREAT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MENZEL.   REIFSPIEL.]\r\n\r\nNobility of line was paramount in Gallait and Piloty, movement with\r\ngrand, kingly gestures, lofty dignity, aristocratic bearing,\r\nknightliness, and a conventional piling up of rich stuffs, alluring to\r\nthe eye. Leys, Menzel, and Meissonier were the first who sacrificed\r\nbeauty to truth, or, more properly, who perceived that a beauty without\r\ntruth is not really beautiful. They came gradually and by an indirect\r\nway to this knowledge as they studied German and Netherlandish masters\r\ninstead of the Italians, and set up the angular, natural outlines of the\r\nGermans against the grace of the Latin masters, which had become banal\r\nthrough a lengthy course of imitation. And thus a return was made to the\r\nmanner of our true ancestors, which had been forgotten during half a\r\ncentury. The place of the Antinous heads of Gallait was taken by\r\nphysiognomies of vigorous characterisation; gesticulating heroes made\r\nway for peaceful, quiet persons, who did not consider themselves under\r\nan obligation to acquire artistic citizenship by a parade of attitude,\r\nbut appeared in their picture as they were in reality. Impassioned\r\nmovement yielded quietly to arms hanging downwards and natural postures.\r\nEven the traditional rules of concave and convex composition were broken\r\nso that the free play of life might more easily come to its rights. Not\r\nless did all three show themselves true painters by preferring\r\nrightness of observation and truth and delicacy of reproduction to\r\nanecdote and richness of invention, and by feeling the need of painting\r\nfigures in their real surroundings. Instead of the conventional velvet\r\nand brocade stuffs, and the folios everywhere and nowhere in place, the\r\nsettles and the brass caskets, there was a naturally painted fragment of\r\nreality, authentically reflecting the whole atmosphere of the period.\r\nThe treatment of nature, hitherto idealistic and arbitrary, became\r\nsynthetic and naturalistic. There was no more abstraction, but direct\r\nobservation of the man and his _milieu_. And if, for the time being,\r\nthis _milieu_ was a _rococo milieu_, artificially reconstructed so that\r\nit could be realistically transferred to the picture, Menzel and\r\nMeissonier, even on account of this realism, would have to be reckoned\r\nas outposts of the modern tendency, and as having very decided points of\r\ncontact with it; and this, even if they had not themselves actually\r\nbecome the pioneers of modernity, forcing their way through against the\r\nliterary and historical movement. It is owing to their works in the past\r\nthat the preference of the public turned less and less to compositions\r\nof fine sentiment, even though grounded on more attentive observation,\r\nand that artists began to regard reality as the most important element,\r\nthe point of departure for every picture. Thus life itself came to be\r\npainted, and preparation was made for the coming demand of a new\r\ngeneration, who wished no more to see old heroes, but themselves, in the\r\nmirror of art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEN WILL GENIUS AWAKE?
