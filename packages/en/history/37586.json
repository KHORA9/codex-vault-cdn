This evolution in\r\n    style reflects not only the increasing involvement of women in\r\n    aquatic activities but also the changing motivations for\r\n    feminine participation. The nature of the style changes in\r\n    aquatic dress were influenced by the fashions of the period,\r\n    while functional improvements were limited by prevailing\r\n    standards of modesty. This mutation of the bathing dress to the\r\n    swim suit demonstrates the changing attitudes and status of\r\n    women in the United States, from the traditional image of the\r\n    subordinate \"weaker sex\" to an equal and active member of the\r\n    society._\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR: _Claudia B. Kidwell is assistant curator of American\r\n    costume, department of civil history, in the Smithsonian\r\n    Institution's Museum of History and Technology._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\nWomen's bathing dress holds a unique place in the history of American\r\ncostume. This specialized garb predates the age of sports costume which\r\narrived during the last half of the 19th century. Although bathing dress\r\nshares this distinction with riding costume, the aquatic garb was merely\r\nutilitarian in the late 18th century while riding costume had a\r\nfashionable role. From its modest status, bathing gowns and later\r\nbathing dresses became more important until their successor, the\r\nswimming suit, achieved a permanent place among the outfits worn by 20th\r\ncentury women. The social significance of this accomplishment was best\r\nexpressed by Foster Rhea Dulles, author of _America Learns to Play_, in\r\n1940, when he wrote:\r\n\r\n    The modern bathing-suit ... symbolized the new status of women\r\n    even more than the short skirts and bobbed hair of the jazz age\r\n    or the athleticism of the devotees of tennis and golf. It was\r\n    the final proof of their successful assertion of the right to\r\n    enjoy whatever recreation they chose, costumed according to the\r\n    demands of the sport rather than the tabus of an outworn\r\n    prudery, and to enjoy it in free and natural association with\r\n    men.[1]\r\n\r\n  [1] FOSTER RHEA DULLES, _America Learns to Play, 1607-1940_ (New York:\r\n      D. Appleton-Century Company, 1940), p. 363.\r\n\r\nSince the prescribed limitations of women's role in any given period are\r\ndetermined and affected by many social factors, the evolution of the\r\nbathing gown to the swimming suit may not only be dependent upon the\r\nchanges in the American woman's way of life, but also may reflect\r\ncertain technological and sociological factors that are not readily\r\nidentifiable. The purpose of this paper is to describe the changes in\r\nwomen's bathing dress and wherever pertinent to present the factors\r\naffecting these styles.[2]\r\n\r\n  [2] The author is indebted to Mrs. Anne W. Murray, formerly Curator\r\n      in Charge of American Costume, Smithsonian Institution, for the\r\n      interest she has shown throughout the research and writing of\r\n      this paper. The difficulties of this work would have been\r\n      greatly compounded without the benefit of her experience and\r\n      encouragement.\r\n\r\nAnyone who attempts to research the topic of swimming and related\r\nsubjects will be confronted with a history of varying reactions. Ralph\r\nThomas, in 1904, described his experiences through the years that he\r\nspent compiling a book on swimming:\r\n\r\n    When asked what I was doing, I have felt the greatest reluctance\r\n    to say a work on the literature of swimming. People who were\r\n    writing novels or some other thing of little practical utility\r\n    always looked at me with a smile of pity on my mentioning\r\n    swimming. Though I am bound to say that, when I gave them some\r\n    idea of the work, the pity changed somewhat but then they would\r\n    say \"Why don't you give us a new edition of your Handbook of\r\n    Fictitious Names?\" As if the knowledge of the real name of an\r\n    author was of any importance in comparison with the discussion\r\n    of a subject that more or less concerns every human being.[3]\r\n\r\n  [3] RALPH THOMAS, _Swimming_ (London: Sampson Low, Marsten & Company\r\n      Limited, 1904), p. 15.\r\n\r\nSuch reactions toward research about swimming probably discouraged many\r\nserious efforts of writing about the subject. Its scant coverage and\r\neven omission in histories of recreation or sports may be explained by\r\nthe fact that swimming cannot be categorized as simply physical\r\nexercise, skill, recreation, or competitive sport. In trying to\r\ndetermine the extent to which women swam in times past it is frustrating\r\nto observe the historians' masculine bias in researching and reporting\r\nsocial history.\r\n\r\nA study of women's bathing dress meets with similar problems, and while\r\na discussion of bathing dress can evoke considerable interest, its\r\nnature is usually considered more superficial than serious. Descriptions\r\nof, and even brief references to, bathing apparel for women are very\r\nscarce before the third quarter of the 19th century. Before this time\r\nonly decorative costume items were considered worthy of description and\r\nbathing costume was not in this category. It is only within\r\ncomparatively recent times that costume historians have conceded\r\nsufficient importance to bathing dress to include meaningful\r\ndescriptions in their research.\r\n\r\nParticipation in water activities was widespread in the ancient world\r\nalthough the earliest origins of this activity are unknown. For example,\r\nin Greece and, later, in Rome, swimming was valued as a pleasurable\r\nexercise and superb physical training for warriors. The more sedentary\r\ncitizens turned to the baths which became the gathering point for\r\nprofessional men, philosophers, and students. Thus bathing and swimming,\r\ncombined originally to fulfill the functions of cleansing and exercise\r\npurely for physical well being, developed the secondary functions of\r\nrecreation and social intercourse.\r\n\r\nWith the rise of the Christian church and its spreading anti-pagan\r\nattitudes, many of the sumptuous baths were destroyed. Christian\r\nasceticism also may have contributed to the decline of bathing for\r\ncleansing. In addition there was a secular belief that outdoor bathing\r\nhelped to spread the fearful epidemics that periodically swept the\r\ncontinent. Although there is isolated evidence that swimming was valued\r\nas a physical skill,[4] swimming and bathing all but disappeared during\r\nthe Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n  [4] JOSEPH STRUTT, _The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England_\r\n      (London: Chatto and Windus, 1876), pp. 151-152.\r\n\r\nIn 1531, long after the Middle Ages, Sir Thomas Elyot wrote of swimming\r\nthat\r\n\r\n    There is an exercise, whyche is right profitable in extreme\r\n    danger of warres, but ... it hathe not ben of longe tyme muche\r\n    used, specially amoge noble men, perchaunce some reders whl\r\n    lyttell esteeme it.[5]\r\n\r\n  [5] SIR THOMAS ELYOT, _The Boke Named the Governour_ (London, 1557),\r\n      vol. 1, pp. 54-55.\r\n\r\nThis early English writer gave no instructions, but expounded on the\r\nvalue of swimming as a skill that could be useful in time of war.\r\n\r\nIt herewith becomes necessary to differentiate between bathing and\r\nswimming with their attendant goals, for it was the goals of each\r\nactivity which influenced the associated customs and costume designs.\r\nFor this discussion we shall define bathing as the act of immersing all\r\nor part of the body in water for cleansing, therapeutic, recreational,\r\nor religious purposes, and swimming as the self-propulsion of the body\r\nthrough water. When we refer to swimming it is necessary to distinguish\r\nwhether it was considered a useful skill, a therapeutic exercise, a\r\nrecreation, or a competitive sport. Thus it is important to note that\r\nwhile bathing for all purposes and swimming as a physical exercise,\r\nrecreation, and sport died out during the Middle Ages, the latter\r\ncontinued to be valued as a skill, particularly for warriors. This\r\nfunction of swimming survived to form the link between the ancients and\r\nthe 17th century.\r\n\r\nAccording to Ralph Thomas, the first book on swimming was written by\r\nNicolas Winmann, a professor of languages at Ingolstadt in Bavaria, and\r\nprinted in 1528. The first book published in England on swimming was\r\nwritten in Latin by Everard Digby and printed in 1587. As Thomas has\r\nstated, Digby's book\r\n\r\n    ... is entitled to a far more important place than the first of\r\n    the world, because, whereas Winmann had never (up to 1866) been\r\n    translated or copied or even quoted by any one, Digby has been\r\n    three times translated; twice into English and once into French\r\n    and through this latter became and probably still is the best\r\n    known treatise on the subject.[6]\r\n\r\n  [6] THOMAS, op. cit. (footnote 3), p. 172.\r\n\r\nThis French version was first published in 1696 with its purported\r\nauthor being Monsieur Melchisedesh Thevenot. In his introduction\r\nThevenot indicates that he has made use of Digby's book in his own\r\ntreatise and that he knows of Winmann's publication. The English\r\ntranslation of Thevenot's version became the standard instruction book\r\nfor English-speaking peoples. Typically, his reasons in favor of men\r\nswimming were based on its being a useful skill (i.e., to keep from\r\nbeing drowned in a shipwreck, to escape capture when being pursued by\r\nenemies, and to attack an enemy posted on the opposite side of a\r\nriver).[7]\r\n\r\n  [7] MELCHISEDESH THEVENOT, _The Art of Swimming_ (London: John Lever,\r\n      1789), pp. 4-5.\r\n\r\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries numerous other publications on swimming\r\nappeared--too numerous to deal with in this paper. Nevertheless, the\r\nrefinement of the art of swimming was not related to the number of\r\ninstruction books. Few of these books actually offered new insights in\r\ncomparison with those that were outright plagiarisms or filled with\r\nmisinformation. In the meantime, bathing was reintroduced and as this\r\nactivity became more widespread swimming was regarded as more than a\r\nuseful skill, but only for men.\r\n\r\nThere is little evidence of women bathing or swimming prior to the 17th\r\ncentury; these activities seem to have been exclusively for men.\r\nNevertheless, Thomas refers to Winmann as writing, in 1538, that\r\n\r\n    at Zurich in his day (thus implying that he was an elderly man\r\n    and that the custom had ceased) the young men and maidens bathed\r\n    together around the statue of \"Saint Nicolai.\" Even in those\r\n    days his pupil asks \"were not the girls ashamed of being naked?\"\r\n    \"No, as they wore bathing drawers--sometimes a marriage was\r\n    brought about.\" If any young man failed to bring up stones from\r\n    the bottom, when he dived, he had to suffer the penalty of\r\n    wearing drawers like the girls.[8]\r\n\r\n  [8] THOMAS, op. cit. (footnote 3), p. 161.\r\n\r\nThomas goes on to say that the only evidence he had found of women\r\nswimming in England in early days was in a ballad entitled \"The Swimming\r\nLady\" and dating from about 1670. Despite these isolated references it\r\nwas not until the 19th century that women were encouraged to swim.\r\n\r\nAfter its decline in the Middle Ages, bathing achieved new popularity as\r\na medicinal treatment for both men and women. In England this revival\r\noccurred in the 17th century when certain medical men held that bathing\r\nin fresh water had healing properties. The resultant spas, which were\r\ndeveloped at freshwater springs to effect such \"cures,\" expanded rapidly\r\nas the number of their devotees increased. By the mid-18th century,\r\nrival practitioners claimed even greater health-giving properties for\r\nsea water both as a drink and for bathing. An economic benefit resulted\r\nwhen, tiny, poverty-stricken fishing hamlets became famous through the\r\npatronage of the wealthy in search of health as well as pleasure.\r\n\r\nWhen the early colonists left England in the first half of the 17th\r\ncentury, the beliefs and practices they had acquired in their original\r\nhomes were brought to the new world. Thus, it is important to note that\r\nduring this period in Europe, swimming was a skill practiced by few,\r\nprimarily soldiers and sailors. It was not until the second half of the\r\ncentury that bathing for therapeutic purposes was becoming popular in\r\nthe old world.\r\n\r\nThe earliest reference to women's bathing costume has been quoted\r\npreviously in Winmann's amazing description of mixed bathing at Zurich.\r\nHe referred to women, wearing only drawers, bathing with men as a custom\r\nno longer practiced when he wrote his book in 1538.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest illustrations of bathing costume I have located is\r\npart of a painted fan leaf, about 1675, that was reproduced in volume 9\r\nof Maurice Leloir's _Histoire du Costume de l'Antiquite_ in 1914. In one\r\ncorner of this painting, which depicts a variety of activities going on\r\nin the Seine and on the river banks at Paris, women are shown immersing\r\nthemselves in water within a covered wooden frame. They are wearing\r\nloose, light-colored gowns and long headdresses. An English source of\r\nthe late 17th century described a very similar costume.\r\n\r\n    The ladye goes into the bath with garments made of yellow\r\n    canvas, which is stiff and made large with great sleeves like a\r\n    parson's gown. The water fills it up so that it's borne off that\r\n    your shape is not seen, it does not cling close as other\r\n    lining.[9]\r\n\r\n  [9] CELIA FIENNES, _Through England on Horseback_, as quoted in IRIS\r\n      BROOKE and JAMES LAVER, _English Costume from the Fourteenth\r\n      through the Nineteenth Century_ (New York: The Macmillan Company,\r\n      1937), p. 252.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my contacts with other costume historians I have\r\nencountered the belief that women did not wear any bathing costume\r\nbefore the mid-19th century. Supporting this theory I have seen a\r\nreproduction of a print, about 1812, showing women bathing nude in the\r\nocean at Margate, England, but the evidence already presented indicates\r\nclearly that costume was worn earlier. Also certain English secondary\r\nsources refer to a nondescript chemise-type of bathing dress that was\r\nworn during the first quarter of the 19th century. Because little study\r\nhas been given European bathing costume, it is not possible to\r\nconjecture under what circumstances costume was or was not used. We do\r\nknow, however, that when bathing became popular in the new world bathing\r\ngowns were worn by some women in the old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCultural Environment\r\n\r\n\r\nAs many European cultural traits were transmitted to the new world via\r\nEngland, so was the introduction of water activities. Nevertheless it\r\nrequired a number of years for such cultural refinements as bathing to\r\ntake root in the new environment. The early colonists brought with them\r\na limited knowledge of swimming, but they did not have the leisure to\r\ncultivate this skill. In New England the Puritan religious and social\r\nbeliefs were as restrictive as the lack of leisure time. In this harsh\r\nclimate, self-indulgence in swimming and bathing did not fulfill the\r\nrequirements of being righteous and useful. Thus the growing popularity\r\nof bathing among the wealthy in Europe during the 17th and early 18th\r\ncenturies had little initial impact in the new world.\r\n\r\nAlthough swimming as a skill predated the introduction of bathing to the\r\nnew world, I will first discuss bathing since the customs and facilities\r\nestablished for it reveal the development of swimming in America, first\r\nfor men and then for women.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATHING\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest sources showing an appreciation of mineral waters\r\nfor bathing in the new world is a 1748 reference in George Washington's\r\ndiary to the \"fam'd Warm Springs.\"[10] At that time only open ground\r\nsurrounded the springs which were located within a dense forest.\r\n\r\n  [10] GEORGE WASHINGTON, _The Writings of George Washington_, John C.\r\n       Fitzpatrick, ed. (Washington: United States Congress, 1931), vol.\r\n       1, p. 8.\r\n\r\nAnother entry for July 31, 1769, records his departure with Mrs.\r\nWashington for these springs (now known as Berkeley Springs, West\r\nVirginia) where they stayed more than a month. They were accompanied by\r\nher daughter, Patsy Custis, who was probably taken in hope of curing a\r\nform of epilepsy with which she was afflicted. In the latter part of the\r\n18th century hundreds of visitors annually flocked to these springs.\r\nAlthough the accommodations were primitive, we early note that the\r\navowed therapeutic aims for visiting these waters were very quickly\r\ncombined with a growing social life on dry land.\r\n\r\n    Rude log huts, board and canvas tents, and even covered wagons,\r\n    served as lodging rooms, while every party brought its own\r\n    substantial provisions of flour, meat and bacon, depending for\r\n    lighter articles of diet on the \"Hill folk,\" or the success of\r\n    their own foragers. A large hollow scooped in the sand,\r\n    surrounded by a screen of pine brush, was the only\r\n    bathing-house; and this was used alternately by ladies and\r\n    gentlemen. The time set apart for the ladies was announced by a\r\n    blast on a long tin horn, at which signal all of the opposite\r\n    sex retired to a prescribed distance, ... Here day and night\r\n    passed in a round of eating and drinking, bathing, fiddling,\r\n    dancing, and reveling. Gaming was carried to a great excess and\r\n    horse-racing was a daily amusement.[11]\r\n\r\n  [11] JOHN J. MOORMAN, _The Virginia Springs_ (Richmond: J. W.\r\n       Randolph, 1854), pp. 259-260.\r\n\r\nThe more permanent bath houses found at the increasing number of springs\r\nin the early 19th century were really only shanties built where the\r\nwater bubbled up. Nevertheless, as civilization moved in upon these\r\nresorts, the current taboos and mores were soon imposed. These gave rise\r\nto customs, facilities, and inventions peculiar to the pastime. The more\r\npermanent facilities carefully separated men from women. Frequently the\r\nwomen's bath was located a considerable distance from the men's and\r\nsurrounded by a high fence. Female attendants were at hand to wait upon\r\nthe ladies, and private rooms were prepared for their use both before\r\nand after bathing.\r\n\r\nIn the early 19th century the fame of Berkeley Springs was eclipsed\r\ntemporarily by the growing popularity of other springs, such as Saratoga\r\nin the north and White Sulphur Springs in the south. The newest\r\nfacilities, however, and the completion of the Baltimore and Ohio\r\nRailroad, restored Berkeley to its former prosperity in the early 1850s.\r\n\r\nThe bath houses at Berkeley Springs in the 1850s are an example of the\r\nfacilities that were considered convenient, extensive, and elegant\r\nduring this period. The gentlemen's bath house contained fourteen\r\ndressing rooms and ten large bathing rooms. In addition to the plunge\r\nbaths, which were twelve feet long, five feet wide, and four and a half\r\nfeet deep, the men had a swimming bath that was sixty feet long, twenty\r\nfeet wide, and five feet deep. The ladies' and men's bath houses were\r\nlocated on opposite sides of the grove. As if this were not reassuring\r\nenough, we are told that the building for the weaker sex was surrounded\r\nby several acres of trees. Thus protected, feminine bathers could choose\r\neither one of the nine private baths or the plunge bath, which was\r\nthirty feet long by sixteen feet wide and four and a half feet deep, as\r\nwell as use a shower or artificial warm baths.[12]\r\n\r\n  [12] Ibid., p. 264.\r\n\r\nThe differences between the two bath houses show that women were not as\r\nactive in the water as the men. Judging from the kind of facilities that\r\nwere provided at Berkeley Springs, the ladies did less \"plunging\" than\r\nthe men and no swimming.\r\n\r\nAlthough accepted in England, bathing in =salt= water did not become\r\npopular in the new world until some time after bathing at springs was\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 a Mr. Bailey announced that he planned to institute \"bathing\r\nmachines and several species of entertainment\" at his resort on Long\r\nIsland.[13] \"A machine of peculiar construction for bathing in the open\r\nsea\" was advertised a few years later by a hotel proprietor at Nahant,\r\nMassachusetts.[14] There is some question as to what the term \"bathing\r\nmachine\" describes. Existing records show that W. Merritt of New York\r\nCity received a patent dated February 1, 1814, for a \"bathing machine.\"\r\nUnfortunately neither a description nor a drawing can be found today.\r\nEuropean patents from the first half of the 19th century reveal that a\r\nbathing machine could be a contraption in which an individual bathed in\r\nprivacy. This is what the above quotations seem to be describing. In\r\ngeneral usage, however, \"bathing machine\" could also have been a device\r\nin which an individual removed his clothing to prepare for bathing; this\r\ntype will be described later.\r\n\r\n  [13] HENRY WANSAY, _An Excursion to the United States_ (Salisbury: J.\r\n       Easton, 1798), p. 211, as quoted in DULLES, _America Learns to\r\n       Play_, p. 152.\r\n\r\n  [14] FRED ALLAN WILSON, _Some Annals of Nahant_ (Boston: Old Corner\r\n       Book Store, 1928), p. 77, as quoted in DULLES, _America Learns to\r\n       Play_, p. 152.\r\n\r\nBy the early 19th century floating baths were established in every city\r\nof any importance including Boston, Salem, Hartford, New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, Washington, Richmond, Charleston, and Savannah. One bath\r\nlocated at the foot of Jay Street in New York City was described as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    The building is an octagon of seventy feet in diameter, with a\r\n    plank floor supported by logs so as to sink the center bath four\r\n    feet below the surface of the water, but in the private baths\r\n    the water may be reduced to three or even two feet so as to be\r\n    perfectly safe for children. It is placed in the current so\r\n    always to be supplied with ocean and pure water and rises and\r\n    falls with the tide.[15]\r\n\r\n  [15] _New York Evening Post_ (June 4, 1813).\r\n\r\nAs was true at the springs, men and women were segregated; but in the\r\nfloating baths they were only separated by being in different\r\ncompartments rather than in different bath houses.\r\n\r\nAlthough there were a number of these baths there were not enough to\r\ncover all of the inviting river banks and sea shores. There are many\r\ninstances of men enjoying the water of undeveloped shores and there is\r\nsome evidence of women venturing into the bays and rivers (fig. 2).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--\"BATHING PARTY, 1810,\" painting by William P.\r\nChappel.\r\n\r\n(_Courtesy of Museum of the City of New York._)]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, few women ventured into the open ocean during the early\r\n19th century. They were generally afraid to brave the force of the ocean\r\nwaves with only a female companion, since prevailing attitudes regarding\r\nthe proper behavior of a lady prevented them from being accompanied by a\r\nman. When a few ignored this dictate, their bold actions gave rise to\r\n\"ill-founded stories of want of delicacy on the part of the\r\nfemales.\"[16] An unbiased traveler, who gave an account of this mixed\r\nbathing in 1833, stated that parties always went into the water\r\ncompletely dressed and for that reason he could see no great violation\r\nof modesty. Mixed bathing at the seashore (fig. 3) was gaining\r\nacceptance, however, when it was reported only thirteen years later that\r\n\"... ladies and gentlemen bathe in company, as is the fashion all along\r\nthe Atlantic Coast....\"[17]\r\n\r\n  [16] JAMES STUART, _Three Years in North America_ (Edinburgh: Robert\r\n       Cadwell, 1833), vol. 1, p. 441.\r\n\r\n  [17] J. W. and N. ORR, _Orr's Book of Swimming_ (New York: Burns and\r\n       Baner, 1846) as quoted in THOMAS, op. cit. (footnote 3), p. 270.\r\n\r\nIn place of the dressing rooms available in the floating baths, special\r\nfacilities were frequently provided. The bathing machine--in this case a\r\ndevice in which one changed clothes--was used where there was a gentle\r\nslope down to the water. This species of bathing machine was a small\r\nwooden cabin set on very high wheels with steps leading down from a door\r\nin the front. The bather entered and, while he was changing, the machine\r\nwas pulled into the sea by a horse. When water was well above the axles\r\nthe horse was uncoupled and taken ashore. The bather was then free to\r\nenter the sea by descending the steps pointed away from the shore (fig.\r\n4). Machines of the 18th and early 19th century were frequently equipped\r\nwith an awning which shielded the bather from public view as she or he\r\ndescended the steps to enter the water. These awnings were left off the\r\nbathing machines during the last half of the 19th century. Such machines\r\nwere used to a great extent in Europe during the 18th and 19th\r\ncenturies. In the United States, however, they were used only to a\r\nlimited extent during the first half of the 19th century. By 1870 they\r\nhad practically disappeared--being replaced by the stationary,\r\nsentry-box type of individual structure and the large communal bath\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\"Sentry-boxes\" were used before the 1870s at beaches where the terrain\r\ndid not encourage the use of the bathing machines. At Long Branch, New\r\nJersey, and at one of the beaches at Newport, Rhode Island, lines of\r\nthese stationary structures were available to the bather for changing,\r\none half designated for women and the other half for men. Hours varied\r\nbut it was the practice to run up colored flags to signal bathing times\r\nfor the ladies and then the gentlemen. A male correspondent wrote from\r\nNewport in 1857:\r\n\r\n    If you are social and wish to bathe promiscuously, you put on a\r\n    dress and go in with the ladies, if you want to cultivate the\r\n    \"fine and froggy art of swimming,\" unencumbered by attire, you\r\n    wait until the twelve o'clock red-flag is run up--when the\r\n    ladies retire.[18]\r\n\r\n  [18] \"Life at Watering-Places--Our Newport Correspondent,\" _Frank\r\n       Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper_ (August 29, 1857), vol. 4, no.\r\n       91, p. 197.\r\n\r\nFrom its early beginnings, in the late 18th and early 19th century, the\r\nsummer excursion to the resorts and spas grew in popularity. In 1848, a\r\nwriter of a Philadelphia fashion report explained that\r\n\r\n    Very few ladies of fashion are now in town, most of them being\r\n    birds of passage during the last of July and all of August. Most\r\n    Americans seem to have adopted the fashion of visiting\r\n    watering-places through the summer.[19]\r\n\r\n  [19] \"Chit-Chat upon Philadelphia Fashions for August,\" _Godey's\r\n       Lady's Book_ (August 1848), vol. 37, p. 119.\r\n\r\nAs the summer excursion became a social event, the recreational\r\npossibilities of bathing overshadowed its earlier therapeutic function.\r\nBathing became part of an increasingly elaborate schedule of activities\r\nwhere each event--bathing, dining, concerts, balls, promenades, carriage\r\nrides--had its appointed time, place, and proper costume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--\"SCENE AT CAPE MAY,\" _Godey's Lady's Book_,\r\nAugust 1849. (_Courtesy of The New York Public Library._)]\r\n\r\nIn addition to stiff ocean breezes, seaside resorts had an extra appeal\r\nthat beguiled visitors away from the spas--namely mixed bathing. For\r\nduring the bathing hour at the seashore all the stiffness and etiquette\r\nof select society was abandoned to pleasure.\r\n\r\n    Again and again I try it. Deliriusm! I forget even Miss ----,\r\n    and dive headforemost into the billows. I rush to meet them. I\r\n    jump on their backs. I ride on their combs, or I let them roll\r\n    over me.... I am in the thickest of the bathers, and amid the\r\n    roar of waves, am driven wild with excitement by the shouts of\r\n    laughter; burst of noisy merriment, and little jolly female\r\n    shrieks of fun. All are wild with excitement, ducking, diving,\r\n    splashing, floating, rollicking.[20]\r\n\r\n  [20] \"My First Day at Cape May,\" _Peterson's Magazine_ (August 1856),\r\n       vol. 30, no. 2, p. 91.\r\n\r\nThus bathing was transformed from a medicinal treatment to a pleasurable\r\npursuit.\r\n\r\nExcursionists had to be hardy individuals, firm in their resolve to\r\ncomplete their trip. Although many railroad lines had been completed\r\nby the 1850s, transportation problems were by no means solved. For\r\nexample, a New York tourist who planned to enjoy a summer at Lake George\r\nhad to travel by boat from New York City to Albany and Troy, then by\r\nrailroad to Morean Corner, and, finally, by stage to the lake. After\r\nlisting the difficulties endured by excursionists, a particularly\r\nembittered correspondent commented in 1856, \"... we envy these happy\r\npeople in nothing but the power to be idle.\"[21]\r\n\r\n  [21] _Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper_ (July 26, 1856), vol. 2,\r\n       no. 33, p. 102.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--\"THE BATHE AT NEWPORT,\" by Winslow Homer,\r\n_Harper's Weekly Newspaper_, September 1858. (Smithsonian photo 59665.)]\r\n\r\nBy the 1870s, travel facilities were rapidly being improved and many new\r\nsummer resorts were established which appealed to a larger segment of\r\nthe population.\r\n\r\n    Comparatively few can stay long at one time at the springs or\r\n    seaside resorts, and hence the peculiar value of arrangements\r\n    like those for enabling multitudes to take frequent short\r\n    pleasant excursions down the New York Bay and along the Atlantic\r\n    coast, as well as up the Hudson, and through Long Island\r\n    Sound.[22]\r\n\r\n  [22] \"Summer Recreation,\" _Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper_ (June\r\n       18, 1870), vol. 30, no. 768, p. 210.\r\n\r\nBeaches that catered to a large cross-section of the population provided\r\na wide variety of informal activities that replaced the established\r\nfunctions found at the more select bathing resorts. For example, the\r\nillustration of Coney Island in 1878 (fig. 5) shows a puppet show; pony\r\nrides for children; a hurdy gurdy; vendors of walking sticks,\r\nsunglasses, and food; and guide ropes in the water for timid bathers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--\"SCENES AND INCIDENTS ON CONEY ISLAND,\"\r\n_Harper's Weekly Newspaper_, August 1878.\r\n\r\n(Smithsonian photo 59666.)]\r\n\r\nIn the 1890s foreign visitors were impressed by American concern with\r\nfinding opportunities to play; early in the century they had remarked on\r\nthe apparent lack of interest in amusements. The term, \"summer resorts,\"\r\nno longer referred to a relatively small number of fashionable watering\r\nplaces. The _New York Tribune_ was running eight columns of summer hotel\r\nadvertisements aimed directly at the middle class. The popular _Summer\r\nTourist and Excursion Guide_ listed moderate-priced hotels and railroad\r\nexcursions; it was a far departure from the fashionable tour of the\r\n1840s.\r\n\r\nThus, as economic and technological factors changed, bathing was\r\ntransformed from a medicinal treatment for the leisure class to a\r\nrecreation enjoyed by a large portion of the population.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWIMMING\r\n\r\nAs has been stated earlier, swimming was being practiced by men in\r\nEurope when the early colonists were leaving their old homes.\r\nNevertheless, the task of establishing new homes left them little time\r\nto practice the \"art of swimming\" or to teach it to fellow colonists.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin is no doubt the most famous early proponent of\r\nswimming in the colonies. In his autobiography written in the form of a\r\nletter to his son in 1771, Franklin revealed his early interest in\r\nswimming.\r\n\r\n    I had from a child been delighted with this exercise, had\r\n    studied and practiced Thevenot's motions and position, and added\r\n    some of my own, aiming at the graceful and easy, as well as the\r\n    useful.[23]\r\n\r\n  [23] JARED SPARKS, _The Works of Benjamin Franklin_ (Boston: Tappan\r\n       and Whittemore, 1844), vol. I, pp. 63-64.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin used every opportunity to encourage his friends to\r\nlearn to swim,\r\n\r\n    as I wish all men were taught to do in their youth; they would,\r\n    on many occurrences, be the safer for having that skill, and on\r\n    many more the happier, as freer from painful apprehensions of\r\n    danger, to say nothing of the enjoyment in so delightful and\r\n    wholesome an exercise.[24]\r\n\r\n  [24] J. FROST, _The Art of Swimming_ (New York: P. W. Gallaudet,\r\n       1818), p. 57.\r\n\r\nNot only was Franklin in favor of being able to swim but when requested\r\nhe advised friends on methods for how to teach oneself. His\r\ninstructions, in his letter of September 28, 1776 to Mr. Oliver Neale,\r\nwere published a number of times even as late as the 1830s.\r\n\r\nAmerica's first swimming school was established at Boston in 1827 by\r\nFrancis Liefer. Two expert swimmers, John Quincy Adams and John James\r\nAudubon, the ornithologist, visited the school and each expressed\r\ndelight at having found such an establishment.\r\n\r\nNumerous books instructing men how to swim were brought into the United\r\nStates in the early 19th century and some were republished here, but the\r\nfirst original work (i.e., not a plagiarism) by an American was not\r\npublished until 1846. In this book the author, James Arlington Bennet,\r\nM.D., LL.D., based his instructions upon his own personal observations\r\nas an experienced swimmer. Dr. Bennet's publication requires special\r\nnote not only due to the basic value of the information but because of\r\nthe extraordinary title (i.e., _The Art of Swimming Exemplified by\r\nDiagrams from Which Both Sexes May Learn to Swim and Float on the Water;\r\nand Rules for All Kinds of Bathing in the Preservation of Health and\r\nCure of Disease, with the Management of Diet from Infancy to Old Age,\r\nand a Valuable Remedy Against Sea-sickness_). Thanks to this explicit\r\ntitle we learn that Dr. Bennet was in favor of women learning to swim.\r\nThis energetic aquatic activity had long been considered a masculine\r\nskill and, despite such a significant publication, this attitude\r\ncontinued until much later in the century.\r\n\r\nWe have already noted in a previous discussion that the Berkeley Springs\r\nbath houses of the 1850s provided a swimming bath for men but no similar\r\nfacilities for women. Also at certain seaside resorts of the same\r\nperiod, a special time was set for men to practice the art of swimming\r\nwithout clothing, but women had no similar opportunity. When the ladies\r\nentered the water they were clothed from head to toe because men were\r\nalso present. The description of women's bathing costume, which will\r\nappear in a later section, clearly shows that women could do little more\r\nthan try to maintain their footing. Undoubtedly some \"brazen\" women did\r\nfind the opportunity to swim, but the general attitude was that women\r\nshould only immerse themselves in water.\r\n\r\nBy the 1860s there was a widespread health movement which gave\r\nadditional momentum to the belief that physical exercise was good for\r\none's well-being. As a result, women were being encouraged to emerge\r\nfrom their state of physical inactivity imposed by social custom.\r\nSwimming had already gained recognition as a healthful exercise for men,\r\nbut with this fresh approach it was even being suggested that women\r\nshould swim. A column that appeared in 1866, entitled \"Physical Exercise\r\nfor Females,\" asserted that\r\n\r\n    Bathing, as it is practiced at our coast resorts, is, no doubt,\r\n    a delightful recreation; but if to it swimming could be added,\r\n    the delight would be increased, and the possible use and\r\n    advantage much extended.[25]\r\n\r\n  [25] _Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper_ (August 25, 1866), vol.\r\n       22, no. 569, p. 355.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the possible objection that the facilities for teaching\r\nwere not always available, the writer maintained that in addition to the\r\nseashore there were rivers, lakes, and ponds as well as the swimming\r\nbaths found in most large cities. He further asserted that if the demand\r\nwere great enough, certain days could be appropriated exclusively to\r\nwomen as was done in some of the London baths.\r\n\r\nThe type of baths referred to in this case were not built simply to\r\nsupply a health-giving treatment or for recreation as described earlier.\r\nAs part of the health movement mentioned above, there was a growing\r\nconcern in regards to personal cleansing; it was realized that merely\r\nsplashing water on the face in the morning was not sufficient for good\r\npersonal hygiene. While facilities for washing the whole body were being\r\ninstalled in wealthy homes, there was also a growing concern for the\r\nmasses of people who could not afford such extravagance. Thus\r\nphilanthropic individuals encouraged the building of public swimming\r\nbaths in densely populated, low income areas. It was hoped that,\r\nalthough the patrons would be covered by bathing costume and would be\r\nseeking refreshment and recreation, this unaccustomed contact with water\r\nwould improve their personal hygiene.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 a reporter for _Leslie's_, who was describing two elegant large\r\nbathhouses (the type described above) in New York City, stated that\r\nMondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays were set apart for ladies and Tuesdays,\r\nThursdays, and Saturdays for gentlemen. These baths became quite popular\r\nin the large cities, particularly among people who could not afford the\r\ntime or money to make trips even to the near seaside resorts. By the\r\n1880s they were so popular that bathing time was scheduled to allow many\r\nsets of bathers to enjoy the water. Thus a number of women who had\r\nprobably never been completely covered with water before had the\r\nopportunity to learn to swim.\r\n\r\nWhile women were being encouraged to practice swimming as a healthful\r\nexercise, this activity was being recognized as a recreation and sport\r\nfor men. The increasing affluence during the last three decades of the\r\n19th century, which made possible the widespread popularity of summer\r\nexcursions, encouraged swimming as an individual pastime as well as a\r\ngrowing spectator sport. This was true not only for swimming but for\r\nnearly every sport we enjoy today. In 1871 a reporter wrote:\r\n\r\n    It is not underrating the interest attached to yachting or\r\n    rowing matches, to say that swimming clubs and swimming matches\r\n    can be made to create wider and more useful emulation among \"the\r\n    Million\" who can never participate in or benefit by those\r\n    notable trials of skill and muscle.[26]\r\n\r\n  [26] Ibid. (July 29, 1871), vol. 32, no. 826, p. 322.\r\n\r\nBy the 1890s this growing interest in spectator and individual sports\r\nevidenced several interesting results. Separate sporting pages were\r\nestablished in the formats of many newspapers. In addition to being a\r\nsummer pastime, \"the art of swimming\" became an intercollegiate and\r\nOlympic sport, and was included on the roster of events for the 1896\r\nrevival of the Olympic Games held in Athens. Innovations in facilities\r\nand techniques helped to alter the character of swimming. The most\r\nnotable of these were the development of the indoor pool and the\r\nintroductions of the crawl stroke into the United States.\r\n\r\nIt was in this time period that swimming for women was becoming socially\r\nacceptable. In 1888, Goucher College, a prominent girls' school, built\r\nits own indoor pool and the following year swimming was listed in its\r\ncatalog for the first time. Writers, in turn, no longer felt it\r\nnecessary to convince readers that women should be more active in the\r\nwater, but concentrated instead on what a woman should know when she\r\nswims. This changing attitude gained world-wide recognition in 1912 at\r\nStockholm when the 100-meter swimming event for women was included in\r\nthe schedule.\r\n\r\nThe period of prosperity following World War I brought a marked increase\r\nin the appreciation of recreation, resulting in an increase of swimming\r\npools and available beaches. Indoor pools, which made swimming a\r\nyear-round activity, were becoming even more numerous than beaches.\r\nSwimming was now established as a sport and a recreation for both men\r\nand women. According to a 1924 magazine article in the _Delineator_,\r\nseldom was a swimming meet held anywhere in the country without events\r\nfor women. At Palm Beach, however, one of the few remaining citadels of\r\n\"high society,\" an axiom of fashion dictated that a lady or gentleman\r\nnot go into the water before 11:45 in the morning; should one do so, one\r\nran the risk of being taken for a maid or valet. The masses, however,\r\nswam for pleasure without regard to the inhibitions of high fashion.\r\n\r\nThis period was also marked by the advent of swimming personalities of\r\nboth sexes. Johnny Weissmuller became a popular hero for his\r\naccomplishments in competitive swimming from 1921 to 1929. Even before\r\nthe war Annette Kellerman, star of vaudeville and movies, had become\r\nfamous for her fancy diving as well as her celebrated figure, which she\r\ndaringly exhibited in a form-fitting, one-piece suit. In addition to\r\nwriting an autobiography, she authored articles and a swimming\r\ninstruction book for women. As an example of what exercise, including\r\nswimming, could do for women, Annette Kellerman also lent her name to a\r\ncourse of physical culture for less \"well-developed\" ladies. Another\r\nproduct of this new age of recreation was Gertrude Ederle, who learned\r\nto swim at the Woman's Swimming Association of New York. She rose to\r\nsudden fame in 1926 as the first woman to swim the English Channel.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, swimming was practiced through the Middle Ages as\r\na useful skill for men. Gradually this activity became regarded as also\r\na healthful exercise and then as a recreation. Finally by the late 19th\r\ncentury swimming also had achieved the status of a competitive\r\nsport--but for men only. It was not until the 1920s that social\r\nattitudes permitted women the same full use of the water as men.\r\n\r\nThe restrictive attitudes defining women's proper behavior in the water\r\nprior to the 1920s were one element of the mores defining women's\r\nparticipation in society. Thus as more liberal attitudes gained\r\nacceptance and modified the original concept of the \"weaker sex,\" women\r\ngradually achieved social acceptance of their full participation in\r\naquatic activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBathing Costume\r\n\r\n\r\nBathing became popular as a medicinal treatment for both men and women\r\nof the new world in the last half of the 18th century. It was the only\r\naquatic activity, however, that was considered proper for women until\r\nover a hundred years later.\r\n\r\nLike so many other customs, changes in bathing costume styles were\r\ninitially introduced by way of England. They were adapted or rejected\r\naccording to the special conditions of this continent. To give a clearer\r\npicture of the costume worn in the colonies and in the United States,\r\ndescriptions of the English dress will be included where pertinent. I\r\nhave not, however, found any evidence showing that bathing nude was a\r\npractice for women in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY BATHING GOWN\r\n\r\nIt is disappointing but not surprising to discover the lack of\r\ndescriptions pertaining to early bathing costume. This simple gown was\r\nutilitarian, not decorative. Thus it deserved little attention in the\r\neyes of the contemporary bather.\r\n\r\nNo doubt it is due to the importance of the original owner that the\r\nfollowing example has survived. In the collection of family memorabilia\r\nat Mount Vernon, there is a chemise-type bathing gown that is said to\r\nhave been worn by Martha Washington (fig. 6). According to a note\r\nattached to the gown signed by Eliza Parke Custis, and addressed to\r\n\"Rosebud,\" a pet name for her daughter, Martha Washington probably wore\r\nthis bathing gown at Berkeley Springs as she accompanied her daughter,\r\nPatsy, in her bath.\r\n\r\nThis blue and white checked linen gown has several construction details\r\nsimilar to the chemise, a woman's undergarment, of the period. The\r\nsleeves were gathered near the shoulder and were set in with a gusset at\r\nthe armpit. The skirt of the gown was made wider at the bottom by the\r\nusual method of adding four long triangular pieces--one to each side of\r\nboth the front and back. The sleeves, however, are not as full as those\r\none would expect to find on a chemise of the period. Also a chemise\r\nwould probably have had a much wider neckline gathered by a draw-string\r\nthreaded through a band at the neck edge. Instead, this bathing gown has\r\na moderately low neckline made wider by a slit down the front which is\r\nclosed by two linen tapes sewn to either edge of the front. Although\r\nless fabric was used for the bathing gown than was normally required to\r\nmake a chemise, it was probably not because of functional considerations\r\nas one might like to think, but because of the scarcity of fabric. Close\r\nexamination reveals that the triangular sections of fabric used to add\r\nfullness to the skirt consist of several pieces. In fact the two\r\nsections used in the back are made from a different fabric, although it\r\nis still a blue and white checked linen. Frugal use of scraps in linings\r\nand hidden sections of decorative costume was common practice in the\r\n18th century. The piecing of the bathing gown is further evidence of the\r\nfact that it was a garment that had no ornamental purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--LINEN BATHING GOWN said to have been worn by\r\nMartha Washington. (_Courtesy of The Mount Vernon Ladies'\r\nAssociation._)]\r\n\r\nOf particular interest are the lead disks which are wrapped in linen and\r\nattached near the hem next to the side seams by means of patches. No\r\ndoubt these weights were used to keep the gown in place when the bather\r\nentered the water.\r\n\r\nThe following account of bathing in Dover, England, in 1782 suggests how\r\nthe bathing gown might have been used at Berkeley Springs:\r\n\r\n    The Ladies in a morning when they intend to bathe, put on a long\r\n    flannel gown under their other clothes, walk down to the beach,\r\n    undress themselves to the flannel, then they walk in as deep as\r\n    they please, and lay hold of the guides' hands, three or four\r\n    together sometimes.\r\n\r\n    Then they dip over head twenty times perhaps; then they come\r\n    onto the shore where there are women that attend with towels,\r\n    cloaks, chairs, etc. The flannel is stripp'd off, wip'd dry,\r\n    etc. Women hold cloaks round them. They dress themselves and go\r\n    home.[27]\r\n\r\n  [27] _Diary of John Crosier_, 1782, as quoted in C. WILLETT and\r\n       PHILLIS CUNNINGTON, _Handbook of English Costume in the\r\n       Eighteenth Century_ (London: Faber and Faber, 1957), p. 404.\r\n\r\nThe earliest illustration showing costume worn in the United States for\r\nfresh water bathing is dated 1810 (see fig. 2). Unfortunately the\r\npainting reveals only that the bathing gowns were long and dark colored\r\nin comparison with the white dresses of the period.\r\n\r\nAn 1848 article which described, in detail, the fashionable dress called\r\nfor by each activity at summer resorts, concludes with the following\r\ntantalizing paragraph:\r\n\r\n    We have no space for an extended description of suitable\r\n    bathing-dresses. They may be procured at any of our town\r\n    establishments for the purpose. Much depends upon individual\r\n    taste in their arrangement, for uncouth as they often of\r\n    necessity are, they can be improved by a little tact.[28]\r\n\r\n  [28] Loc. cit. (footnote 19).\r\n\r\nThis is the only reference to American bathing costume of the second\r\nquarter of the 19th century that the author has found at this time.\r\nNevertheless, an English source describes what must have been a\r\ntransitional style between the chemise-type bathing gown and the more\r\nfitted costume of the 1850s.\r\n\r\nThe _Workwoman's Guide_, published in London, 1840, included\r\ninstructions for making both a bathing gown and a bathing cap. Health\r\nand modesty were the main considerations that influenced the choice of\r\ncolor and type of material.\r\n\r\n    Bathing gowns are made of blue or white flannel, stuff,\r\n    calimanco, or blue linen. As it is especially desirable that the\r\n    water should have free access to the person, and yet that the\r\n    dress should not cling to, or weigh down the bather, stuff or\r\n    calimanco are preferred to most other materials; the dark\r\n    coloured gowns are the best for several reasons, but chiefly\r\n    because they do not show the figure, and make the bather less\r\n    conspicuous than she would be in a white dress.[29]\r\n\r\n  [29] A LADY, _The Workwoman's Guide_ (London: Simpkin, Marshall, and\r\n       Co., 1840), p. 61.\r\n\r\nThe following details reveal that, in general, this 1840 bathing gown\r\nstarts as an unshaped garment similar to the gown attributed to Martha\r\nWashington [brackets are mine].\r\n\r\n    As the width of the materials, of which a bathing gown is made,\r\n    varies, it is impossible to say of how many breadths it should\r\n    consist. The width at the bottom, when the gown is doubled,\r\n    should be about 15 nails [1 nail = 21/4 in.]: fold it like a\r\n    pinafore, slope 31/2 nails for the shoulders, cut or open slits of\r\n    31/2 nails long for the armholes, set in plain sleeves 41/2 nails\r\n    long, 31/2 nails wide, and make a slit in front 5 nails long.[30]\r\n\r\n  [30] Loc. cit. (footnote 29).\r\n\r\nThe instructions for finishing this gown, however, show that the sleeves\r\nwere worn close around the wrists and that the fullness of the skirt was\r\nsecured at the waist by a belt.\r\n\r\n    In making up, delicacy is the great object to be attended to.\r\n    Hem the gown at the bottom, gather it into a band at the top,\r\n    and run in strings; hem the opening and the bottom of the\r\n    sleeves and put in strings. A broad band should be sewed in\r\n    about half a yard from the top, to button round the waist.[31]\r\n\r\n  [31] Loc. cit. (footnote 29).\r\n\r\nBy the addition of the above details this type of bathing gown more\r\nclosely approximates the style of the long-skirted blouse of the 1850s\r\nto be described later.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the bathing cap we are told that,\r\n\r\n    These are made of oil-silk, and are worn, when bathing, by\r\n    ladies who have long hair.... It is advisable, however, for\r\n    those who have not long hair, to bathe in plain linen caps, so\r\n    as to admit the water without the sand or grit, and thus the\r\n    bather, unless prohibited on account of health, enjoys all the\r\n    benefit of the shock without injuring the hair.[32]\r\n\r\n  [32] Ibid., p. 68.\r\n\r\nThe \"Scene at Cape May\" (fig. 3) shows women wearing long-skirted,\r\nlong-sleeved, belted gowns as well as head coverings similar to the type\r\ndescribed in _The Workwoman's Guide_.\r\n\r\nThus during the period when bathing became popular as a medicinal\r\ntreatment, women wore loose, open gowns perhaps patterned after a common\r\nundergarment, the chemise. Although this chemise-type bathing costume\r\nmust have been very comfortable when dry, its fullness was restrictive\r\nwhen wet. The bather could only immerse herself in water which was all\r\nthat was necessary for the treatment. As the recreational possibilities\r\nof bathing began to overshadow its health-giving properties, women's\r\nbathing dresses also became more fitted, following the general\r\nsilhouette of women's fashions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENE AT CONEY ISLAND--SEA BATHING ILLUSTRATED.\r\n\r\nFigure 7.--SEA BATHING AT CONEY ISLAND, from _Frank Leslie's Illustrated\r\nNewspaper_, September 1856.\r\n\r\n(Smithsonian photo 58437.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nBIFURCATED BATHING DRESS\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of the 19th century in England and the United\r\nStates, a more tolerant attitude toward feminine exercise led women to\r\nabandon the fiction that they were not bipedal while bathing. This\r\nacknowledgment, however, was not fostered solely by the need for a more\r\nfunctional bathing dress. It was first evidenced by a few daring\r\nEuropean women who wore lace-edged pantaloons trimmed with several rows\r\nof tucking under their daytime dresses. The shorter, untrimmed,\r\nknee-length drawers which quickly replaced the pantaloons, became an\r\nunseen but essential item in the fashionable English lady's toilette of\r\nthe 1840s. These drawers, or a plainer version of the longer pantaloons,\r\nwere adapted not only to the female riding habit but the bathing dress\r\nas well. An 1828 English source reported that \"Many ladies when riding\r\nwear silk drawers similar to what is worn when bathing.\"[33] With the\r\nincreased interest in physical exercise for women, ankle-length, open\r\npantaloons also were being worn in the 1840s with a long overdress as an\r\nearly form of gymnasium suit. This evidence of the early use of drawers\r\nsuggests that, like English ladies, women in the United States were\r\nprobably wearing a type of drawers beneath their nondescript bathing\r\ngowns during the second quarter of the 19th century. There is some\r\nslight support of this theory in the following stanza of a poem that\r\nappeared in 1845:\r\n\r\n    But go to the beach ere the morning be ended\r\n    And look at the bathers--oh what an array\r\n    The ladies in trowsers, the _gemmen_ in _blowses_\r\n    E'en red flannel shirts are the \"go\" at Cape May.[34]\r\n\r\n  [33] As quoted in C. WILLETT and PHILLIS CUNNINGTON, _The History of\r\n       Underclothes_ (London: Faber and Faber, 1951), p. 130.\r\n\r\n  [34] \"Cape May,\" _Godey's Lady's Book_ (December 1845), vol. 31, p.\r\n       268.\r\n\r\nThe rather crude but delightful sketch of seabathing at Coney Island in\r\n1856 (fig. 7) shows the ladies wearing very full, ankle-length, trousers\r\nwith a sack top extending loosely only a few inches below the waist.\r\nThis type of bathing costume, which was primarily a bifurcated garment\r\ninstead of a skirted one, became the prevailing fashion as reported in\r\nEnglish women's magazines of the 1860s.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the originally European skirtless costume, the\r\nPhiladelphia publication, _Peterson's Magazine_, stated that bathing\r\ndress should consist of a pair of drawers and a long-skirted dress. The\r\nrecommended drawers were full and confined at the ankle by a band that\r\nwas finished with a ruffle. These drawers were attached to a \"body\" and\r\nfastened so that, even if the skirt washed up, the individual could not\r\npossibly be exposed. The dress was made by pleating or gathering the\r\ndesired length of material onto a deep yoke with a separate belt\r\nsecuring the fullness at the waist. The bottom of the hem was about\r\nthree inches above the ankle and was considered rather short. Loose\r\nshirt sleeves were drawn around the wrist by a band which was finished\r\nwith a deep ruffle as a protection against the sun. According to this\r\narticle many women wore a small talma or cape which hid the figure to\r\nsome extent. It was recommended that the drawers, dress, and talma be\r\nmade of the same woolen material.\r\n\r\n    Bathing-dresses, although generally very unbecoming can be made\r\n    to look very prettily with a little taste. If the dress is of a\r\n    plain color, such as grey, blue or brown, a trimming around the\r\n    talma, collar, yoke, ruffles etc ..., of crimson, green or\r\n    scarlet, is a great addition.[35]\r\n\r\n  [35] \"Fashions for August, Bathing Dresses,\" _Peterson's Magazine_\r\n       (August 1856), vol. 30, p. 145.\r\n\r\nTo complete a bathing toilette the following items were considered\r\nnecessary: a pair of large lisle thread gloves, an oil cap to protect\r\nthe hair from the water, a straw hat to shield the face from the sun,\r\nand gum overshoes for tender feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--BATHING DRESS, c. 1855. (_Courtesy of\r\nPhiladelphia Museum of Art._ Photograph by A. J. Wyatt, staff\r\nphotographer.)]\r\n\r\nThe red, tan, and blue-green checked bathing dress shown in figure 8 is\r\njauntily trimmed with crimson braid edging the collar, belt, and wrist\r\nand ankle bands. This costume is a variation of the style described\r\npreviously. The drawers, unlike those described in _Peterson's\r\nMagazine_, are sewn to a linen band with linen suspenders attached. The\r\nunfitted, unshaped skirt (8 ft. 8 in. in circumference) is pulled in at\r\nthe waist by a belt attached to the center back. A similar technique for\r\nforming a waistline is described in _The Workwoman's Guide_ of 1840.\r\n\r\nWomen's magazines in the United States from the third quarter of the\r\n19th century show illustrations of bathing costume, but in many\r\ninstances these publications used European fashion plates. _Harper's\r\nBazar_, (spelled thus until 1929) particularly in its early years, used\r\nfashion plates and pattern supplements from its German predecessor _Der\r\nBazar_. Thus, in one issue one can find a fashion plate showing the\r\npredominantly bifurcated European bathing suit and, in a column on New\r\nYork fashions, a separate description of long-skirted bathing dresses\r\nwith trousers. During the same period _Peterson's Magazine_ had\r\nillustrations previously used in the London publication, _Queen's\r\nMagazine_.\r\n\r\nAmerican women seem to have accepted the majority of styles shown in\r\nEuropean fashion plates, except for the skirtless bathing suits. The\r\nwriter of an 1868 column on New York fashions sought to convince his\r\nreaders to try the more daring European style although he grudgingly\r\nadmitted that the \"Bathing suits made with trousers and blouse waist\r\nwithout skirt are objected to by many ladies as masculine and\r\nfast....\"[36] This style was in fact, very similar to the costume worn\r\nby men when they bathed with the ladies. A year later, the writer of the\r\nsame fashion column had given up the campaign to dress all women in the\r\nskirtless suits and admitted that these imports \"... are worn by expert\r\nswimmers, who do not wish to be encumbered with bulky clothing.\"[37]\r\nSuch practical bathing dress was thus limited to a very small number of\r\nprogressive women.\r\n\r\n  [36] \"New York Fashions,\" _Harper's Bazar_ (August 8, 1868), vol. 1,\r\n       no. 41, p. 643.\r\n\r\n  [37] Ibid. (July 10, 1869), vol. 2, no. 28, p. 435.\r\n\r\nThe majority, consisting of those who were strictly bathers, wore the\r\nankle-length drawers beneath a long dress as described or illustrated in\r\nthe majority of sources that originated in the United States. Why was\r\nthe European bathing suit not fully adopted by American women?\r\nDifferences between the bathing customs of the two continents\r\nundoubtedly encouraged the development of different dress. While men and\r\nwomen in the United States bathed together freely at the seashore during\r\nthe latter half of the 19th century, this practice was not widely\r\naccepted in England until the early 1900s. In the presence of men,\r\nAmerican women probably felt compelled to retain their more concealing\r\ndress and drawers.\r\n\r\nIn England swimming seems to have been more popular among women than it\r\nwas in the United States. While encouraging its readers to swim, during\r\nthe late 1860s, _Queen's Magazine_ used forceful language of a kind that\r\nwas not found in American publications until the late 19th century. If\r\nswimming was more acceptable as a feminine exercise in England it is\r\nunderstandable why English women were more receptive to a functional,\r\nskirtless bathing suit--especially since it was worn only in the\r\npresence of other women.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, Winslow Homer, who was later to become a well-known American\r\npainter, was welcomed into the society at Newport until it became\r\napparent that he wanted to sketch the bathers for a weekly newspaper\r\n(see fig. 4). So great were the ensuing objections that he was permitted\r\nto complete his sketches \"... provided he depicted the bathers only in\r\nthe water and only above the waistline and without divulging the\r\nidentity of the bathers.\"[38]\r\n\r\n  [38] B. BROOKE, \"Bathing-dress with Hat and Gloves,\" _Hobbies_ (August\r\n       1958), vol. 63, p. 90.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen in figure 4, these sketches serve more as a testament of\r\nHomer's fancy than as an accurate historical statement on style. The two\r\nfeminine legs exposed in the water from just below the knee to the toe\r\nand the feminine head coverings appear to be anachronisms. According to\r\nseveral other illustrations of the period, these women were undoubtedly\r\nwearing long drawers. The young artist at 22, however, has been\r\ndescribed as having an eye for feminine beauty and a sense of fashion.\r\nHe seems to have exploited to the full the decorative possibilities of\r\nhoop skirts blown by the breeze or agitated by some pretty accident to\r\ndiscreetly reveal a trim ankle. A drama of breeze versus long skirt\r\nappears with the small feminine figure in the left background of this\r\nprint. The force of the waves and the motion of the frolicking bathers\r\ngave the artist opportunity to show two more pretty accidents. The only\r\nhead covering he showed for feminine bathers was a ruffled cap that\r\nframed the face. Other sources show Newport bathers wearing the less\r\nattractive wide-brimmed straw hat (fig. 9). The straw headgear worn over\r\nthese caps seems more likely since Newport's fashionable belles would\r\nsurely have sacrificed appearances and worn a straw hat to avoid an\r\nunfashionable sunburn and tan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 9.--BATHING HAT of natural color and purple straw,\r\nc. 1880. (Smithsonian photo P-65409.)]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Homer's sketch reflects characteristics seen in certain\r\nsurviving examples from the 1860s--namely that the top was becoming more\r\nfitted, being attached completely to a belt with the fuller skirt\r\npleated or gathered to the bottom edge of the belt. In the Design\r\nLaboratory Collection of the Brooklyn Museum there is an 1860 black\r\npoplin specimen that may be a bathing dress. This example is trimmed at\r\nthe shoulder seam with epaulets, an example of the extent to which\r\nfashion was finally playing a part in bathing costume.[39]\r\n\r\n  [39] Photograph and pattern appears in Blanch Payne, _History of\r\n       Costume_ (New York: Harper & Row, 1965), pp. 518, 583-584.\r\n\r\nThe dresses described above appear peculiar not only to 20th century\r\neyes, but they also seem to have amused mid-19th century correspondents.\r\nOne writer in 1857 declared that,\r\n\r\n    We don't think a man could identify his own wife when she comes\r\n    out of the bathing-house. A plump figure enters, surrounded with\r\n    a multitude of rustly flounces and scarcely able to squeeze an\r\n    enormous hoop through the door. She is absent a few minutes, and\r\n    presto change! out comes a tall lank apparition, wrapped in the\r\n    scanty folds of something that looks more like a superannuated\r\n    night-gown than anything else, and a battered straw-chapeau\r\n    knocked down over the eyes, and stalks down towards the beach\r\n    with the air and gait of a Tartar chieftain![40] [fig. 10.]\r\n\r\n  [40] \"An Excursion to Long Branch,\" _Frank Leslie's Illustrated\r\n       Newspaper_ (August 22, 1857), vol. 4, no. 90, p. 182.\r\n\r\nAnother writer felt that he\r\n\r\n    ... must say--even in the columns of _Frank Leslie's\r\n    Illustrated_--that they don't look very picturesque or pretty\r\n    when _a la Naiade_.... Rather limp, sacks tied in the middle,\r\n    eel-bottles, hydropathic coalheavers and \"longshoremen,\" and\r\n    preternaturally dilapidated Bloomers, would appear to be the\r\n    ideals aimed at.[41] [fig. 11.]\r\n\r\n  [41] Loc. cit. (footnote 18).\r\n\r\nThis use of the term \"Bloomers,\" referring to long full drawers or\r\ntrousers, is a reminder of how similar the 1855 bathing gown with\r\ndrawers (see fig. 8) was to the reform dress introduced in 1848 and worn\r\nby Amelia Bloomer, the feminist, in 1852.\r\n\r\nDespite the evident use of a new waistline treatment, the most popular\r\nbathing costume of the 1870s, according to _Harper's Bazar_, continued\r\nto feature the yoke blouse that reached at least to the knee. This\r\ncombination of blouse and skirt was held in position at the waist by a\r\nbelt. The high neck was finished with a sailor collar or a standing\r\npleated frill, while the long sleeves and full Turkish trousers,\r\nbuttoned on the side of the ankle, concealed the limbs. In 1873 a column\r\non New York fashions reported an effort to popularize short-sleeved,\r\nlow-throated suits then in favor at European bathing places and which\r\nhad been illustrated in the _Bazar_. Nevertheless, the writer hedged\r\nthis report by adding that\r\n\r\n    It is thought best, however, to provide an extra pair of long\r\n    sleeves that may be buttoned on or basted in the short puffs\r\n    that are sewn in the arm holes. Sometimes a small cape fastening\r\n    closely about the throat is also added.[42]\r\n\r\n  [42] \"New York Fashions,\" _Harper's Bazar_ (July 19, 1873), vol. 6,\r\n       no. 29, p. 451.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, sketches of bathing scenes from the seventies indicate\r\nthat some American women wore even shorter sleeves and trousers than\r\nthose prescribed by the fashion magazines.\r\n\r\nLinen and wool fabrics were both suggested in the 1840s, but by the\r\n1870s flannel was most frequently used for bathing dresses, with serge\r\nalso being recommended. Navy blue, and to a lesser extent, white, gray,\r\nscarlet, and brown were popular colors in checks as well as solid\r\ncolors trimmed with white, red, gray, or blue worsted braid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--\"HOW SHE WENT IN,\" from _Harper's Bazar_,\r\nAugust 1870. (Smithsonian photo 61585A.)]\r\n\r\nBathing mantles or cloaks were worn to conceal the moist figure when\r\ncrossing the beach. These garments were made of Turkish toweling with\r\nwide sleeves and hoods, and were so long as \"to barely escape\" the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 one good bathing cap was described as an oiled silk bag-crown\r\ncap large enough to hold the hair loosely. The frill around the edge was\r\nbound with colored braid. Many ladies preferred, however, to let their\r\nhair hang loose and under a wide-brimmed hat of coarse straw tied down\r\non the sides to protect their skin from the sun (fig. 9).\r\n\r\nBathing shoes or slippers were generally worn when the shore was rough\r\nand uneven. In 1871 manila sandals were worn, but the most functional\r\nbathing shoes are said to have been high buskins of thick unbleached\r\ncotton duck with cork soles. They were secured with checked worsted\r\nbraid. Two years later there were bathing shoes of white duck or sail\r\ncanvas with manila soles. Slippers for walking in the sand were \"mules\"\r\nor merely toes and soles made of flannel, braided to match the cloak,\r\nand sewn to cork soles.\r\n\r\nThroughout this period the social aspect of bathing predominated over\r\nthe therapeutic goals and women were making a greater effort to\r\ntransform their bathing garments into attractive and functional outfits.\r\nMotivated by the presence of men at the seashore and by the competition\r\nwith other women for masculine attention, ladies were more concerned\r\nwith the style of their bathing dresses and appropriate trimmings. Thus\r\nbathing costume joined the ranks of other fashions described in women's\r\nmagazines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11.--\"HOW SHE CAME OUT,\" from _Harper's Bazar_,\r\nAugust 1870. (Smithsonian photo 61585B.)]\r\n\r\nNow that women were frolicking in the water rather than simply being\r\ndunked several times, their costume became somewhat more functional.\r\nLong trousers gave them greater freedom in the water although the skirts\r\nwhich continued to be worn, tended to negate this improvement. Even as\r\nearly as the 1870s there were efforts to shorten sleeves and eliminate\r\nhigh necklines. This trend to make bathing dress more practical\r\nincreased in momentum toward the end of the century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12.--BATHING COSTUMES from a supplement to _The\r\nTailor's Review_, July 1895.\r\n\r\n(_Courtesy of Library of Congress._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCESS STYLE BATHING DRESS\r\n\r\nAlthough attitudes toward sports were more enlightened by the 1880s,\r\nmany women continued to wear the old bathing dress with its belted\r\nblouse extending to a long skirt and a pair of trousers. As an alternate\r\nto this garb, the \"princess style\" was developed with the blouse and\r\ntrousers cut in one piece or else sewn permanently to the same belt. A\r\nseparate skirt extending below the knee was buttoned at the waist to\r\nconceal the figure. This new style in bathing costume was probably\r\nderived from an innovation in women's underwear. During the late 1870s a\r\nnew style of undergarment, the \"combination\" of chemise and drawers, had\r\ncome into use. Petticoats could be fastened to buttons sewn around the\r\nwaist of the combination. This streamlining of undergarments helped the\r\nlady of fashion to maintain a desirably svelte figure. Apparently the\r\nadvantages of this streamlining were obvious, because it was not long\r\nbefore women were quietly adapting this style to bathing dresses. By the\r\n1890s the skirt was often omitted for swimming (fig. 12), giving the\r\nmore active women more freedom in the water. Following popular dress\r\nstyles, the top of the bathing costume was bloused over the belt. The\r\nsailor collar, either large or small, was a great favorite, but a\r\nstraight standing collar with rows of white braid was also worn.\r\n\r\nThe \"princess style\" was not the only innovation available in bathing\r\ndress. _Harper's Bazar_ reported in 1881 that imported French bathing\r\nsuits[43] for ladies were made without sleeves, since any covering on\r\nthe arm interfered with the freedom desirable for swimming.\r\nNevertheless, according to other contemporary fashion descriptions,\r\nAmerican bathing suits retained their long sleeves until the early 1880s\r\nwhen the foreign fashion of short sleeves came to the United States. In\r\n1885 it was reported that\r\n\r\n    The sleeves may be the merest 'caps' four or five inches deep\r\n    under the arm, curved narrow toward the top, and lapped there or\r\n    they may be half-long and straight, reaching to the elbows, or\r\n    else they may be the regular coat sleeves covering the arms to\r\n    the wrist. With the short sleeves it is customary to add the\r\n    sleeves cut from a gauze vest to give the arm some protection\r\n    from the sun.[44]\r\n\r\n  [43] The term \"bathing suit\" as opposed to \"bathing dress\" came into\r\n       use in the last quarter of the 19th century when the bifurcated\r\n       bathing garment with a shorter skirt was widely accepted. The two\r\n       terms, however, continued to be used interchangeably, with\r\n       \"bathing dress\" appearing less frequently.\r\n\r\n  [44] \"New York Fashions,\" _Harper's Bazar_ (July 4, 1885), vol. 18,\r\n       no. 27, p. 427.\r\n\r\nSleeves were pushed up in 1890 and puffed high about the shoulders by\r\nmeans of elastic tape in the hem. By 1893 fashion reports acknowledged\r\nthat sleeve length was a matter of individual choice.\r\n\r\nDespite this neat resolution of the diminishing sleeve, contemporary\r\nsketches of bathing scenes indicate that some women in the United States\r\nwere wearing the shorter sleeves even earlier.\r\n\r\nShort full trousers, reaching just below the knee, accompanied by\r\nknee-length skirts--sometimes worn even shorter--succeeded the long\r\nTurkish trousers and ankle-length skirt. As the trousers diminished in\r\nlength, long stockings or bathing shoes with long stocking tops became a\r\nnecessary part of the bathing costume to cover the lower limbs,\r\nparticularly in mixed bathing (see fig. 1). The stockings, which were\r\ncotton or wool, plain or fancy, and of any color or combination of\r\ncolors in keeping with the costume, were worn with a variety of bathing\r\nshoes, sandals, or slippers when bathing off a rocky shore. Foot\r\ncoverings were usually made of white canvas; the slippers were held on\r\nby a spiral arrangement of braid or ribbon about the ankles, while the\r\nlaced shoes were often made with heavy cork soles. A gaiter shoe or\r\ncombination shoe and stocking was made of waterproof cloth, laced up the\r\nsides, and reached to about the knees. Low rubber shoes were also worn.\r\n\r\nBathing caps of waxed linen or oiled silk were used to protect the hair.\r\nThey had whale bone in the brim and could be adjusted by drawstrings in\r\nthe back. Blue, white, or ecru rubber hats were also used. These caps\r\nhad large full crowns--which held in all the hair--and wired brims. A\r\nwide-brimmed rough straw hat, tied on with a strip of trimming braid or\r\nwith ribbon, was sometimes worn as protection against the sun (fig. 9).\r\n\r\nBathing mantles like those of the 1870s were still being worn by the\r\nlate 19th century and these were frequently trimmed with colored braid.\r\nCotton tapes sewn in parallel rows, mohair braid, or strips of flannel\r\nwere still being used to make the bathing dress more attractive.\r\n\r\nNavy blue and white, as well as ecru, maroon, gray, and olive were\r\npopular colors for the bathing dress. In 1890 the writer of a fashion\r\ncolumn thought it pertinent to add that \"... black bathing suits are\r\nworn as a matter of choice, not merely by those dressing in\r\nmourning.\"[45] Apparently the wearing of black no longer had this\r\nexclusive significance when bathing, but prior to 1890 it did.\r\n\r\n  [45] Ibid. (July 5, 1890), vol. 23, no. 27, p. 523.\r\n\r\nAs women became more active in the water and were learning to swim they\r\nbegan to accept more practical changes in bathing costume. Not only the\r\nstyle, as described previously, but also the fabric was considered for\r\nits functional characteristics. Flannel was still widely used but was\r\nbeing replaced by serge which was not as heavy when wet. Another\r\nindication of this trend was that stockinet, a knitted material, was\r\ngaining in popularity at the end of the century.\r\n\r\nThe \"princess style\" of the early 1890s combined the drawers and bodice\r\nin one garment: the separate skirt fell just short of the ends of the\r\ndrawers which covered the knees. By the mid-1890s, however, the drawers\r\nwhich were now called knickerbockers, were shortened so as to be\r\ncompletely covered by the knee-length skirt. These knickerbockers were\r\neither attached to the waist in the popular \"princess style\" or they\r\nwere fastened to the waist by a series of flat bone buttons.\r\n\r\nDuring this same period, the mid-1890s, knitted, cotton tights were\r\nsometimes worn in place of knickerbockers. Bathing tights differed from\r\nthe knickerbockers in that they were hemmed rather than gathered on an\r\nelastic band at the lower edge and that they were not attached to the\r\nwaist. When tights were used they were completely concealed by a\r\none-piece, knee-length bathing dress. The use of the more streamlined\r\nbathing tights was another step toward more functional bathing costume.\r\nDespite these improvements, most women continued to wear stockings,\r\nusually black, when they bathed or swam in public. The dictates of\r\nfashion and standards of modesty continued to conflict with practical\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 13.--BATHING DRESS OF BLACK \"MOHAIR,\" c. 1900.\r\n(Smithsonian photo 60383.)]\r\n\r\nAs with street dress, corsets seem to have been an important though\r\nunseen bathing article necessary for maintaining smart posture. In 1896\r\nit was reported that\r\n\r\n    Unless a woman is very slender, bathing corsets should be worn.\r\n    If they are not laced tightly they are a help instead of a\r\n    hindrance to swimming, and some support is needed for a figure\r\n    that is accustomed to wearing stays.[46]\r\n\r\n  [46] Ibid. (June 13, 1896), vol. 29, no. 24, p. 503.\r\n\r\nWhile describing the bathing dresses available in 1910 an article noted:\r\n\"Some of these are made up with ... princess forms that are boned so as\r\nto do away with the bathing corset.\"[47]\r\n\r\n  [47] Ibid. (July 1910), vol. 43, no. 7, p. 552.\r\n\r\nThe bodice of the bathing costume continued to be bloused, but by 1905\r\nit was modified to be merely loose. An article appearing in 1896 noted\r\nthat bathing suits should be cut high in the neck, not tight around the\r\nthroat, but close enough to prevent burning by the sun. The sailor\r\ncollar continued to be used during the late 1890s but became less\r\nfashionable shortly after the turn of the century. Nevertheless there\r\nhad to be some white around the neck for the bathing dress to be\r\nconsidered smart. The puffed sleeves, which had become popular in the\r\nlate 1890s were modified in breadth and length to allow free use of the\r\nmuscles in swimming (fig. 13).\r\n\r\nIn 1897 fashion magazines were suggesting that skirts of bathing dresses\r\nlooked best when the front breadth was shaped narrower toward the belt,\r\nwhile by 1902 the skirts were fitted over the hips in order to delineate\r\nthe figure. In 1905 pleated skirts again became fashionable, although\r\nflared skirts were still acceptable.\r\n\r\nDark blue and black were the popular colors, although white, red, gray,\r\nand green were also used. Flannel was no longer recommended for bathing\r\ndress; serge and \"mohair\"--a fabric with a cotton warp and a mohair or\r\nalpaca weft--were widely used. The impractical bathing dress of silk\r\nfabric was worn by those who could afford this extravagance; thus, the\r\nconspicuous consumption of the \"leisure class\" was even found at the\r\nbeaches.\r\n\r\nBathing hats were still being worn but it was considered more\r\nfashionable to wear a rubber or oil silk cap covered with a bright silk\r\nturban when there was a surf. For the bather who seldom ventured very\r\nfar into the water the most fashionable practice was to have no covering\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nThroughout the 19th century bathing costume followed an impelling course\r\ntoward becoming more functional. As the popularity of recreational\r\nbathing and then swimming for women increased, the number of yards of\r\nfabric required to make a bathing dress decreased. Nevertheless, by the\r\n1900s, many women knew how to swim, but the majority were still bathers.\r\nThus bathing suits continued in use through the first quarter of the\r\n20th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSwimming Costume\r\n\r\n\r\nBathing costume did not evolve gracefully into the swim suit, nor was\r\nthere an abrupt replacement of one garment for the other. Instead, a\r\ngarb designed for swimming emerged in the 19th century as tentatively\r\nand as poorly received as had the suggestion that women should be active\r\nin the water. The growing popularity of swimming and the changing status\r\nof women eventually made it possible for the swimming suit to replace\r\nthe bathing suit in the 1920s. By the 1930s, however, this trend was\r\naccelerated by a growing advertising and ready-to-wear clothing\r\nindustry. Thus a history of the swimming costume tends to divide itself\r\ninto two sections: early swimming suits and the influence of the swim\r\nsuit industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY SWIMMING SUITS\r\n\r\nThe earliest reference to swimming costume I have found was in 1869. At\r\nthis date swimming in the United States was considered a masculine\r\nskill, exercise, and recreation; only men were provided with a real\r\nopportunity to swim at popular watering places. As described previously,\r\n_Harper's Bazar_ reported that American women in general rejected the\r\nEuropean bathing suit made with long trousers and a skirtless waist.\r\nNevertheless, this costume was \"... worn by expert swimmers, who do not\r\nwish to be encumbered with bulky clothing.\"[48]\r\n\r\n  [48] \"New York Fashions,\" _Harper's Bazar_ (July 10, 1869), vol. 2,\r\n       no. 28, p. 435.\r\n\r\nIn the 1870s the rare descriptions of this more functional\r\ngarment--called \"swimming suit\" even at this early date--were limited to\r\na sentence or two buried within long columns of fine print describing\r\npopular bathing apparel. One mentions a \"... single knitted worsted\r\ngarment, fitting the figure, with waist and trousers in one.\"[49]\r\nAnother was made without sleeves as \"one garment, the blouse and\r\ntrousers being cut all in one, like the sleeping garments worn by small\r\nchildren.\"[50] These more practical bifurcated garments probably derived\r\nfrom the European suit of the 1860s that had been rejected by the\r\nmajority of American women. For example, an English source reported that\r\nin 1866 the following garment was worn: \"... Swimming Costume, a body\r\nand trousers cut in one, secures perfect liberty of action and does not\r\nexpose the figure.\"[51]\r\n\r\n  [49] Ibid. (July 13, 1872), vol. 5, no. 28, p. 459.\r\n\r\n  [50] Ibid. (July 25, 1874), vol. 7, no. 30, p. 475.\r\n\r\n  [51] As quoted in C. WILLETT CUNNINGTON, _English Women's Clothing in\r\n       the 19th Century_ (New York: Thomas Yoseloff, 1958), p. 225.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions of American swimming suits, however brief, offered\r\nevidence that the pastime was growing in popularity with women.\r\nGenerally speaking, 19th century women's magazines were mere\r\ndisseminators of fine and decorous ideas and practices for well-mannered\r\nladies; their editors were not innovators. With such an editorial policy\r\nit is understandable that these magazines would not, as a rule,\r\npublicize trends of popular origin until they were fairly well\r\nestablished. The skirtless swimming suit of the 1870s was no doubt more\r\ncommon in the United States than its meager description in _Harper's\r\nBazar_ would seem to indicate.\r\n\r\nAs long as feminine swimming was not generally accepted, however,\r\nefforts to develop practical swimming suits remained isolated owing to\r\nthe lack of communication between manufacturer and consumer and to\r\ntraditional attitudes. Feminine interest in swimming and physical\r\nactivities threatened belief in the \"weaker-sex\" that contributed to\r\nmaintaining the traditional masculine and feminine roles; efforts to\r\ndevelop functional swimming dress also attacked established standards of\r\nfeminine modesty. These challenges to the status quo were met with the\r\nweapon of the complacent majority--silence. Consequently, from the third\r\nquarter of the 19th century, when we find the first reference to a\r\nspecialized garment for swimming in the United States, writings on\r\nswimming costume appeared infrequently until the 1920s.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 two \"ladies' bathing jerseys\" and two bathing suits of the\r\ntraditional type appeared in the _First Illustrated Catalogue of Knitted\r\nBathing Suits_ of J. J. Pfister Company in San Francisco. The captions\r\nover the illustrations leave no question that the briefer bathing\r\njerseys were intended for swimming while the others were for bathing.\r\nThese jerseys--form-fitting tunics that were mid-thigh in length--were\r\nmade with high necks and cap sleeves. Underneath this garment women wore\r\ntrunks that extended to the knee and stockings; there was also the\r\nalternate choice of tights, a combination of trunks and stockings. To\r\ncomplete the outfit the feminine reader was encouraged to buy a knitted\r\nskull cap.\r\n\r\nApparently these bathing jerseys were successful; three, instead of two,\r\njerseys appeared in the same catalog in 1890. It is obvious from this\r\nlater catalog, however, that there was a greater demand for bathing\r\ndresses since twelve designs of the skirted costume were featured as\r\nopposed to the two dresses in the first issue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--THE RECOMMENDED COSTUME FOR SWIMMING from J.\r\nParmly Paret, _The Woman's Book of Sports_, 1901. (Smithsonian photo\r\n58436.)]\r\n\r\nEven by the early 20th century it is difficult to find specific\r\nreferences to a swimming suit in women's magazines; only occasionally\r\ndoes a concern with swimming obtrude into the traditional descriptions\r\nof bathing dress. In _The Woman's Book of Sports_, however, J. Parmly\r\nParet was specific about the requirements for a suitable swimming\r\ncostume in 1901.\r\n\r\n    It is particularly important that nothing tight should be worn\r\n    while swimming, no matter how fashionable a dress may be for\r\n    bathing. The exercise requires the greatest freedom, and a\r\n    swimming costume should never include corsets, tight sleeves, or\r\n    a skirt below the knees. The freedom of the shoulders is the\r\n    most important of all, but anything tight around the body\r\n    interferes with the breathing and the muscles of the back, while\r\n    a long skirt--even one a few inches below the knees--binds the\r\n    legs constantly in making their strokes.[52]\r\n\r\n  [52] J. PARMLY PARET, _The Woman's Book of Sports_ (New York: D.\r\n       Appleton & Co., 1901), p. 74.\r\n\r\nAlthough this costume (fig. 14) more closely resembles the traditional\r\nbathing dress than the jersey described previously, this discussion\r\nillustrates the growing dichotomy between bathing dress and swimming\r\ndress and between fashionable styles and functional styles.\r\n\r\nPhotographs of East coast beach scenes in 1903 show a few women wearing\r\ncostumes different from the black or navy blue bathing dress worn by the\r\nmajority. These independent spirits seem to be wearing close-fitting\r\nknitted trunks that cover the knees or, when with stockings, come within\r\nan inch or two above the knee. Above these trunks they appear to be\r\nwearing knitted one-piece tunics or belted blouses that cover the hips.\r\nThis costume, sleeveless or short-sleeved, and with a simplified\r\nneckline, must have been the functional suit of its day.\r\n\r\nAn important impetus was given to the development of the swimming suit\r\nwith the entrance of women into swimming as a competitive sport. On\r\nSeptember 5, 1909, Adeline Trapp wore a one-piece knitted swimming suit\r\nwhen she became the first woman to swim across the East River in New\r\nYork, through the treacherous waters of Hell Gate. Both the swimming\r\nsuit and the swim were part of a campaign devised by Wilbert\r\nLongfellow--of the U.S. Volunteer Life Saving Corps--to encourage women\r\nto learn to swim.\r\n\r\nAdeline Trapp was a summer employee of the Life Saving Corps in 1909.\r\nMr. Longfellow saw in the 20-year-old Brooklyn school teacher a\r\nrespectable young woman who could be a source of publicity. He ordered\r\nher to get a one-piece swimming suit for the swim. As early as 1899 in\r\nEngland, a woman participating in competitions organized by the Amateur\r\nSwimming Association could have worn a one-piece, skirtless, knitted\r\ncostume with a shaped sleeve at least three inches long, a slightly\r\nscooped neck, and legs that extended to within three inches of the knee.\r\nMr. Longfellow may have had this English suit in mind. He might have\r\nknown of similar suits in the United States or he might have simply\r\nwanted to free Adeline of yards of fabric to make her more competitive\r\nwith male swimmers. Nevertheless, Adeline Trapp did not know that the\r\nEnglish suits existed, nor did she know where she could find one. She\r\nspent many hours going from one American manufacturer to another trying\r\non men's knitted suits. She found that they were all cut too low at the\r\nneck and armholes and did not cover enough of the legs to preclude\r\ncriticism. At this point a friend who worked for a stocking manufacturer\r\noffered to get her a suitable costume from England. This costume, a\r\nknitted, gray cotton suit--whether originally for a man or woman in\r\nEngland is not known--was the one Adeline wore when she swam Hell Gate.\r\n\r\nAlthough more than thirty men attempted the swim, the fact that a woman\r\naccomplished the feat made newspaper headlines. Following this event,\r\nMiss Trapp received a terse letter from the Brooklyn School Board\r\nstating that they thought it improper for an educator of Brooklyn\r\nchildren to appear in public so scantily dressed in a one-piece swimming\r\ncostume. For her future swims Adeline Trapp was careful to have someone\r\ncarry a blanket to throw over her as she emerged from the water.[53]\r\n\r\n  [53] Telephone interview with Adeline Trapp Mulhenberg, May 1966.\r\n\r\nIn 1910, Annette Kellerman arrived in the United States from Australia\r\nby way of England. For her fancy diving exhibitions she wore sleeveless\r\none-piece knitted swimming tights that covered her from neck to toe--a\r\ncostume she had probably adopted in England.\r\n\r\nThe decade from 1910 to 1920 was a crucial period in the history of\r\nbathing and swimming costume. Popular attitudes were changing in favor\r\nof the woman who swam but, as frequently occurs in social reforms, there\r\nwas a cultural lag between public opinion and the policies of\r\ninstitutions. The Red Cross, which began its excellent water safety\r\nprogram in 1914, taught women to swim but did not admit women as Life\r\nSaving Corps members until 1920. Symbolic of the conflict between old\r\nand new attitudes were the relative roles of bathing and swimming\r\ncostume during this period. As Annette Kellerman described them:\r\n\r\n    There are two kinds ... those that are adapted for use in water,\r\n    and those that are unfit for use except on dry land. If you are\r\n    going to swim, wear a water bathingsuit. But if you are merely\r\n    going to play on the beach, and pose for the camera fiends, you\r\n    may safely wear the dry land variety.... I am certain that there\r\n    isn't a single reason under the sun why everybody should not\r\n    wear lightweight suits. Anyone who persuades you to wear the\r\n    heavy skirty kind is endangering your life.[54]\r\n\r\n  [54] ANNETTE KELLERMAN, _How to Swim_ (New York: George H. Doran\r\n       Company, 1918), p. 47.\r\n\r\nChic women's magazines, however, were still reluctant to admit in their\r\nfashion pages that a more utilitarian costume existed. The June 1, 1917\r\nissue of _Vogue_ reported that there were two kinds of bathing suits: a\r\nloose straight suit and those on surplice lines, \"... which hold their\r\nplace by virtue of being so very becoming.\"[55]\r\n\r\n  [55] _Vogue_ (June 1, 1917), vol. 49, no. 11, p. 85.\r\n\r\nThe most popular of these, the surplice, was not a novelty of the season\r\nbut a continuation of 19th century bathing suit styles. Fashion\r\nillustrations show that the hemline of the skirt was approaching the\r\nmiddle of the knee, with the bloomers remaining hidden. There was also a\r\nrevival of the style that permitted the bloomers to show several inches\r\nbelow the skirt. In this case the bloomers reached the knee and the\r\nskirt was several inches shorter. Both versions were shown with short\r\nsleeves or cap sleeves, or sleeveless; \"V\" necklines with collars and\r\nsquare necklines were widely used. The more fashionable creations were\r\nmade of silk taffeta or \"surf satin,\" while the majority were made of\r\n\"mohair,\" wool jersey, worsted, or closely woven cotton. Black and navy\r\nblue were unquestionably the favorite colors.\r\n\r\nThe loose straight suit, which evidently gained its inspiration from the\r\nchemise frock of the period, had no waistline and hung straight from the\r\nshoulders (fig. 15); a belt or sash was frequently looped below the\r\nnatural waistline on the hips. The chemise-type of bathing suit differed\r\nfrom the surplice only in having no fitted waist and requiring less\r\nfabric.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15.--BLACK SILK BATHING DRESS, 1923.\r\n\r\n(Smithsonian photo P-65412.)]\r\n\r\nIn the June 15, 1917 issue, _Vogue_ modified its position of two weeks\r\nearlier to acknowledge that there was a third style of costume worn in\r\nthe water. Again, the descriptions of the surplice and chemise-type\r\nbathing suits were accompanied by numerous illustrations. No drawings,\r\nhowever, were published to show the knitted jersey suit that was\r\ndescribed as \"... usually sleeveless, quite short and fairly straight\r\n...\" and \"... intended for the woman who swims expertly.\"[56]\r\n\r\n  [56] Ibid. (June 15, 1917), vol. 49, no. 12, p. 67.\r\n\r\nAs late as the early 1920s, the fashion pages of _Harper's Bazar_ and\r\n_Vogue_ were concentrated on the bathing suits, aiming at readers\r\ninvolved in the social life of the seaside resorts--lounging about the\r\nbeach with occasional splashing in the water. The growing numbers of\r\nwomen who wanted swimming suits, however, had only to turn to the\r\nadvertising sections of these same magazines to find that even in 1915\r\nsuch shops as Bonwit Teller & Co. and B. Altman & Co. were advertising\r\nknitted swimming suits.\r\n\r\nIn June 1916, _Delineator_ solved the dilemma of bathing versus swimming\r\ncostume in an intriguing article written to sell a pattern for a bathing\r\ncostume. In description and presentation of illustrations, the article\r\nemphasized a costume with \"all the features essential to a practical\r\nswimming-suit.\"[57] The blouse and bloomers were attached at the waist\r\nin this garment which had a square neckline and no skirt or sleeves.\r\nMade up in wool jersey, this would have been a practical swimming\r\ncostume for the period. But this was not the only style available from\r\nthis one pattern. The following variations were included: a sailor\r\ncollar on a \"V\" neckline; a high-standing collar, long sleeves; and a\r\ndetachable skirt with the fullness either pleated or gathered into a\r\nwaistband, to be worn long to the knees or just short enough to show\r\nseveral inches of the bloomer. In this way _Delineator_ succeeded in\r\nsatisfying nearly every degree of conservatism--an amazing\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\n  [57] \"For the Modern Mermaid,\" _Delineator_ (June 1916), vol. 38, no.\r\n       6, p. 52.\r\n\r\nThe spring edition of _Sears, Roebuck and Co. Catalog_ for 1916 offered\r\na one-piece, or \"California-style,\" knitted worsted bathing suit with\r\nthe underpiece sewn to a skirt. This costume was less elaborate than the\r\nother dresses shown, although it was still knee length. The 1918 spring\r\ncatalog showed two one-piece knitted outfits suitable for swimming in\r\nstriking contrast to the surplice bathing dresses that were also\r\noffered. By 1920 all of the bathing costumes illustrated in the _Sears,\r\nRoebuck and Co. Catalog_ were of the more abbreviated and functional\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nIn 1918 Annette Kellerman recommended that serious swimmers wear\r\nclose-fitting swimming tights or the two-piece suits commonly worn by\r\nmen. Being quick to admit that this costume would not be tolerated at\r\nall beaches, she told dedicated swimmers to\r\n\r\n    ... get one-piece tights anyway and wear over the tights the\r\n    lightest garment you can get. It should be a loose sleeveless\r\n    garment hung from the shoulders. Never have a tight waist band.\r\n    It is a hindrance. Also on beaches where stockings are enforced\r\n    your one-piece undergarment should have feet, so that the\r\n    separate stocking and its attendant garter is abolished.[58]\r\n\r\n  [58] Loc. cit. (footnote 54).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16.--ONE-PIECE SWIMMING SUIT OF KNITTED WOOL, c.\r\n1918. (Smithsonian photo P-65413.)]\r\n\r\nKnitted swimming suits found in advertisements of the period were either\r\none-piece or two-piece; the trunks were attached or separate, but they\r\nalways extended a few inches below the brief skirt. Although this\r\ncostume could be considered sleeveless, in some examples the suit was\r\nbuilt up under the arm--a concession to the demands of modesty (fig.\r\n16). The scooped or \"V\" neckline with no collar was relatively high; in\r\norder to put on or remove the suit it was unbuttoned at one shoulder.\r\n\r\nIt was this type of swimming costume which evolved into the garment that\r\ndominated the fashion pages of the mid-1920s.\r\n\r\nChanges in costume brought about by the acceptance of swimming also\r\naffected leg covering. By 1920 fashion pages showed stockings that\r\nreached only to the calf and many advertisements for the abbreviated\r\nknitted bathing suits presented the lower leg covered with only the high\r\nlaced bathing shoe (fig. 17) or, in a few cases, bare. Bathing slippers\r\nwere black satin or black or white canvas held on the feet by ribbon\r\ncriss-crossed up the leg to tie at mid-calf. Shoes were of satin or\r\ncanvas, laced in the front to mid-calf.\r\n\r\nThere was a wide variety of colorful rubber caps; some were gathered on\r\na band or with a ruffle while others were closely fitted with brims.\r\nAlso popular was a close-fitting rubber cap with a colorful scarf tied\r\naround it; swimmers did without the scarf.\r\n\r\nDespite the distinction between the two types of bathing apparel, the\r\nbeach cloak continued to be used by both the serious swimmer and those\r\nwho stayed safely in the shallows. Some bathing wraps had large collars\r\nand were only mid-calf in length. Colorful beach hats, beach parasols,\r\nbags, and blankets were used, particularly by the bather who seldom got\r\nwet.\r\n\r\nThe acceptance of swimming as a feminine activity provided an impetus\r\nfor the use of the knitted swimming suit; but standards of modesty had\r\nto change before this suit could gain wide acceptance. Bathing dresses\r\nof the 19th century had been designed to cover, conceal, and obscure not\r\nonly the torso but the limbs as well. The swimming suit that was gaining\r\nacceptance in the early 1920s not only revealed the arms and a good part\r\nof the legs, but actually dared to follow the lines of the torso.\r\nContemporary descriptions, that seem amusingly cautious today, included\r\nsuch statements as \"... all Annette Kellerman Bathing Attire is\r\ndistinguished by an incomparable, daring beauty of fit that always\r\nremains refined.\"[59] Even less cautious was a statement that these\r\nbathing suits were \"famous ... for their perfect fit and exquisite,\r\nplastic beauty of line.\"[60]\r\n\r\n  [59] _Harper's Bazar_ (June 1920), vol. 55, no. 6, p. 138.\r\n\r\n  [60] Ibid. (June 1921), 54th year, no. 2504, p. 101.\r\n\r\nThe growing numbers of women who wore the new styles of bathing dress\r\nwere a cause of concern to self-appointed guardians of decency. In 1917\r\nthe convention of the American Association of Park Superintendents at\r\nNew Orleans adopted a series of bathing regulations for city beaches\r\nwhich dealt with the problems of the changing bathing suit. In general\r\nthese regulations specified that \"... No all-white or flesh-colored\r\nsuits are permitted or suits that expose the chest lower than a line\r\ndrawn on a level with the arm pits.\"[61] In regard to ladies' bathing\r\nsuits these men agreed that\r\n\r\n    Blouse and bloomer suits may be worn with or without stockings,\r\n    provided the blouse has quarter-arm sleeves or close-fitting arm\r\n    holes, and provided the bloomers are full and not shorter than\r\n    four inches above the knee.[62]\r\n\r\n  [61] \"Bathing Regulations for City Beaches,\" _American City_ (May\r\n       1917), vol. 16, no. 5, p. 537.\r\n\r\n  [62] Loc. cit. (footnote 61).\r\n\r\nRegulations for knitted suits were similar, with the added caution that\r\nthe skirt hem could be no more than two inches above the lower edge of\r\nthe trunks. As late as 1923 these regulations were in effect at public\r\nbeaches in Cleveland and Chicago.\r\n\r\nBy 1923 a permanent change was occurring in the design of beach apparel.\r\nThe chemise-style bathing dress of black taffeta or satin still appeared\r\nin the fashion magazines (fig. 15), but by 1929 it had disappeared. The\r\nresult of the struggle between the fancy bathing suit and the plain\r\nknitted suit became obvious even in the popular magazines of the period.\r\nIn the opening paragraphs of a short story, Shirley, the villainess,\r\ndonned a smart bathing suit of puffy black taffeta, with a\r\npatent-leather belt and a scarlet scarf, and baked in the shadow of a\r\nbig umbrella. Margaret, the heroine, in a plain knitted suit and black\r\ncap was intent only upon diving, plunging, and splashing for her own\r\nenjoyment. In another story a young lady, who came out of the sea\r\nwearing a \"... bathing suit so scanty it seemed a mere gesture flung\r\ncarelessly to the proprieties ...\" described herself as a modern young\r\nwoman.[63]\r\n\r\n  [63] JANE PRIDE, \"Pick-up,\" _Delineator_ (May 1927), vol. 110, no. 5,\r\n       p. 15.\r\n\r\nIn the early twenties advertisements capitalized on the functional\r\ncharacteristics of swimming suits. A 1923 advertisement declared:\r\n\r\n    No! No! Not a bathing suit! No! The Wil Wite is a swimming suit.\r\n    The difference is great--very great. A bathing suit is something\r\n    in which to \"Sun\" oneself and wear on the beach. A swimming suit\r\n    is a garment made expressly for those who swim. It is free from\r\n    frills and furbelows. It follows the form with the same\r\n    sincerity that a neat silk stocking clings to a trim ankle. It\r\n    fits when dry or wet ... it is a real swimming suit.[64]\r\n\r\n  [64] _Harper's Bazar_ (June 1923), 56th year, no. 2528, p. 5.\r\n\r\nThe knitted swimming suit which achieved dominance over the bathing suit\r\nin the 1920s was similar to its earlier version except that both the\r\narmhole and the neckline were lower. This made it possible to put on the\r\nsuit without unbuttoning one of the straps at the shoulder--a feature\r\nthat was omitted in this newer style. Sometimes a sash was looped\r\nloosely around the waist; a geometrically shaped monogram provided a\r\nsmart decoration. The affluent swimmer could distinguish herself from\r\nthe masses by wearing silk jersey. During the last half of this decade\r\nwomen coquettishly adopted a man's swimming suit, consisting of a\r\nstriped sleeveless jersey shirt with dark colored trunks and a white\r\nbelt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 17.--BATHING SHOES, 1910. (Smithsonian photo\r\nP-65417.)]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the last stand for the bathing dress was the appearance of the\r\n\"dressmaker suit\" toward the end of the 1920s and on into the early\r\n1930s. The neck and shoulder line copied those of currently fashionable\r\nevening dresses, with a parallel treatment of the skirt, which was\r\nshortened to end just below the hips. This suit was worn by women\r\nreluctant to brave the revealingly unadorned but popular swimming suit.\r\n\r\nA depilatory advertisement took advantage of the increasing\r\n\"stockingless vogue\" and explained that \"Women who love swimming for the\r\nsake of the sport, find stockings a great hindrance to their\r\nenjoyment.\"[65] By the end of the twenties, the stocking for bathing\r\nand swimming had become an article of the past.\r\n\r\n  [65] _Delineator_ (June 1923), vol. 102, no. 6, p. 95.\r\n\r\nAlthough women were accepted in athletics and had achieved a generally\r\nwider role in public life, white, untanned skin was still the ideal in\r\nthe 1920s. Thus sunproof creams, beach coats, and beach umbrellas were\r\nstill important.\r\n\r\nAccording to the well-known \"trickle-down\" theory of fashion, styles of\r\ndress first become fashionable among the socially elite and wealthy and\r\nare then, in time, emulated by those at lower socio-economic levels. The\r\nknitted swimming suit, however, entered the fashion pages by a different\r\nroute. It had its insignificant start with the skirtless bifurcated\r\ngarments of the late 1860s. Going against popular opinion, some women\r\ndid swim. They violated prevalent standards of modesty by continuing to\r\nwear a functional suit. Gradually the demand grew. A plain, utilitarian\r\ngarment was needed; pressure increased. Thus, by the 1920s the swimming\r\nsuit prevailed, complimenting the image of the newly emancipated \"modern\r\nwoman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSWIM SUIT INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nAlong with the increased popularity of swimming and the appearance of\r\nthe knitted swimming suit we note the rapid development of the\r\nready-to-wear swim suit industry. During the last half of the 19th\r\ncentury women frequently made their own bathing dresses with the aid of\r\npaper pattern supplements that appeared in women's magazines of the\r\nperiod. Dressmakers also may have used these patterns to outfit their\r\nclients for their summer excursions. On the other hand, ladies in the\r\nlarge cities could purchase bathing dresses at furnishing stores or rent\r\nthem at the large public beaches. A small advertisement in _Harper's\r\nBazar_, August 9, 1873, announced that in addition to gauze undershirts,\r\nlinen drawers, collars and cuffs, Union Adams & Co. of New York had\r\nbathing dresses for sale. The notice is noteworthy when one considers\r\nthat the ready-to-wear clothing industry and the field of advertising\r\nwere in their infancy.\r\n\r\nWith the increased popularity of the knitted suit, knitting mills\r\nincluded men's and women's swimming apparel in their more prosaic lines\r\nof underwear and sweaters. Many companies advertised the new product,\r\nsteadily increasing their range until the inevitable occurred. In 1921 a\r\nnational advertising campaign for swimming suits was initiated by\r\nJantzen, a hitherto obscure knitting mill whose production had been\r\nlimited to sweaters, woolen hosiery, and jackets for Chinese workmen.\r\nCapitalizing on the growing interest in swimming, Jantzen prominently\r\nadvertised swimming suits instead of bathing dresses. The retail stores\r\nselling these suits advertised locally, but national advertising became\r\nthe domain of the manufacturers, educating the public to associate\r\ncertain positive qualities with their names.\r\n\r\nTo the delight of the swim suit industry, swimming was more than a\r\npassing vogue. In 1934, a National Recreation Association study on the\r\nuse of leisure time found that among ninety-four free-time activities\r\nswimming was second only to movies in popularity.[66] Although the\r\nnumber of swimmers was increasing, competition caused the swim suit\r\nindustry to take a new approach. Manufacturers attempted to increase the\r\nvolume of sales through advertising by emphasizing style. In 1927 one\r\ncompany advertised a national appeal to woman's vanity by declaring that\r\nbeach _uniforms_ were out and that beach _styles_ were in.\r\n\r\n  [66] _The Leisure Hours of 5,000 People; a Report of a Study of\r\n       Leisure Time Activities and Desires_ (New York, National\r\n       Recreation Assoc., 1934).\r\n\r\nIt was a general characteristic of the 1930s that swimming suits covered\r\nless of the bather. The attached trunks of the swimming suit no longer\r\nextended down the leg but it survived unseen beneath the vestigial\r\nremains of a skirt.\r\n\r\nThe diminishing coverage of the swim suit was also related to a changing\r\nattitude toward sun exposure. For years women had protected their\r\ndelicate skin to prevent any unladylike, healthy appearance. The barrier\r\nagainst a lady having a tan deteriorated as women became accepted into\r\nathletic activities. By 1930, women eagerly sought a sun tan. Not only\r\nwere there lotions to help the neophyte sun-worshiper acquire a rich\r\neven tan, but creams were available for the impatient who wished an\r\ninstant tan. In line with this trend, swim suit manufacturers and\r\nsellers promoted and sold low sun-back or California styles, halter\r\nnecks, and cut-out sections that exposed various portions of the\r\nmidriff. The favorite suit, however, was the form-fitting maillot of\r\nwool jersey with no skirt.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1930s, the textile trade journals applauded the increasing\r\nstress on styling as a means of encouraging the consumer to buy a new\r\nsuit rather than to use \"last year's.\" Stylishness was introduced into\r\nknitted suits through the use of a greater range of solid colors.\r\nParti-colored suits, with stripes and slashes of a second or even a\r\nthird color, were also featured (fig. 18). Knitting mills were pressed\r\nto introduce novelty effects such as mesh, waffle motifs, and lace\r\npatterns in knitted fabrics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 18. ONE-PIECE SWIMMING SUITS OF KNITTED WOOL,\r\n1930. (_Courtesy of Cole of California._)]\r\n\r\nThe insistent emphasis on novelty encouraged the development of such\r\nitems as all-rubber swimming suits with embossed surfaces simulating\r\nknitted textiles. Although this innovation was not successful, because\r\nthe suits were clammy and easily torn, rubber did find a definite use in\r\nswimming suits with the introduction of Lastex--a yarn made with a core\r\nof rubber wrapped by a fine thread of another fiber. The following\r\nadvertisement for swimming suits made with Lastex best explains why this\r\nimportant innovation is still valued by the industry today:\r\n\r\n    There's no wrinkle, no bag, no sag, even under the most ruthless\r\n    sun! No other human device can even approximate that utter\r\n    freedom, that perfection of fit, at rest or in motion, that airy\r\n    but strictly legal sense of wearing nothing at all. There is no\r\n    substitute for this elastic yarn, which imparts lasting\r\n    elasticity to any fabric.[67]\r\n\r\n  [67] _Harper's Bazaar_ (June 1934), 68th year, no. 2660, p. 9.\r\n\r\nHaving exhausted the novelty effects of knitted swim suits, women in the\r\nlate 1930s began to respond eagerly to the wide range of decorative\r\npossibilities found in woven fabrics. Cotton and the relatively new\r\nman-made fibers such as Celanese acetate and Dupont rayon were used in\r\nfabrics such as ginghams, chambrays, piques, and featherweight elastic\r\nsatins. To the pleasure of the fashion editors, who claimed to be\r\nanxious for some relief from the nudity of the maillot, suits of woven\r\nfabrics were made with flared skirts. These had knitted linings of\r\ncotton, acetate, or wool which satisfied any taste as to warmth or\r\ncoolness on the beach. The belief was prevalent that a wool swimming\r\nsuit was needed for warmth. In the 1940s the two-piece, bare-midriff\r\nsuit with tight shorts or flared skirt was a popular and logical\r\ndevelopment from the earlier suits with cut-out sections around the\r\nmidriff. The more extreme French bikini, however, was not adopted by\r\nAmerican women when it was first introduced in the 1940s.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the forties the one-piece swimming suit staged a comeback\r\nwith a slight variation: the new suits were structurally sculptured to\r\nmold, control, and stay put while swimming or sunning. They were the\r\nproduct of ingenious engineering, inside and out. The use of shirring\r\nand skillful cutting and handling of fabric focused attention on the\r\nbust line, while the frequent use of Lastex tended to streamline the\r\nhips like a girdle. Inside, the careful use of wire and plastic boning\r\npermitted many of these suits to assume a shape of their own and even to\r\nbe worn without straps.\r\n\r\nA short-lived revival of the covered-up look appeared in the fashion\r\npages in 1954 but, unlike the suits with covered arms and neck of the\r\nprevious century, these suits drew attention to the parts of the body\r\nthat were covered. The fate of this unsuccessful novelty is a good\r\nillustration of the fact that, ultimately, the buyer has the final word\r\nin the volatile field of feminine fashion. The swim suit manufacturers\r\napparently misinterpreted the American woman's readiness to discard the\r\nmore revealing two-piece suit in favor of an altered form of the\r\nmaillot. Always ready with novelties to make last year's suit obsolete,\r\nthe manufacturers tried to encourage women into a more extreme\r\ncovered-up look. Despite the power of national advertising women were\r\nunwilling to go back in time. The female beach-goer and sun-worshiper\r\nopposed a suit that might interfere with the tanning process.\r\n\r\nBy 1960, the production of swim suits had become a big business with\r\nmass distribution and mass markets. Expanded world-wide transportation\r\nfacilities and increased leisure and affluence in the United States\r\ncreated a demand for midwinter vacation clothing for use in warmer\r\nclimates, and the manufacturing of swim suits became a year-round\r\nundertaking, producing 14,728 million knitted and woven suits in\r\nwomen's, misses, and junior sizes in 1960.[68]\r\n\r\n  [68] Compiled from \"Production of Selected Items of Knit Outerwear and\r\n       Swimwear; 1960-1961,\" _Apparel Survey 1961_ (1962), series\r\n       M23A(61)-2, p. 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest bathing dress for women in the United States may have been\r\nan old smock or shift, followed by a bathing gown based on the shift or\r\nchemise. Although women's bathing and swimming costume achieved an\r\nidentity of its own during the 19th century, the evolution of this garb\r\nfollowed certain innovations in women's underclothing, namely, drawers\r\nin the first half of the 19th century, the \"combination\" of the late\r\n1870s, and the brassiere and panties of the 1930s. The greatest number\r\nof minor style changes, however, were direct reflections of fashions in\r\nstreet dress. The rising hemline and, at times, the discarding of a\r\nskirt during periods when women wore long dresses for other activities\r\ncan be attributed to changes caused by the functional requirements of\r\nbathing and swimming; the shortening of sleeves and trousers in the last\r\nquarter of the 19th century were also functional improvements. The\r\nbenefits of the shorter trousers, however, were minimized when modesty\r\nrequired women to cover their exposed legs with stockings.\r\n\r\nSwimming suits have been considered a 20th century innovation; in fact\r\none corporation is under the impression that a member of their staff was\r\nresponsible for the first use of the term \"swimming suit\" early in the\r\ncentury. The findings presented in this paper show that some women were\r\nwearing \"swimming suits\" that were distinctly different from bathing\r\ndresses as early as the 1870s and that both co-existed for some 50\r\nyears. Bathing dresses disappeared in the 1920s with the widespread\r\nacceptance of its functional counterpart; \"bathing suit\" no longer\r\nreferred to a special type of costume but became interchangeable with\r\nthe term \"swimming suit.\"\r\n\r\nThe insistent trend toward more functional costume reached its ultimate\r\nconclusion with the refinements of the knitted swimming suit in the\r\n1930s. Subsequent changes have not improved upon the functional design\r\nof this classic suit. In many instances these variations have been\r\nmerely to satisfy the feminine desire for distinctive apparel and the\r\nindustry's need for perishable fashions. Female competitive swimmers\r\nhave continued to wear the simple knitted suit--now of nylon rather than\r\nwool.\r\n\r\nThe changes since the 1930s have shown a trend toward diminution in the\r\ncoverage of the swimming suit. One cannot be certain what this means for\r\nthe future, but it is unlikely that either the swim suit industry or\r\nstandards of modesty of the near future will permit a total elimination\r\nof swimming costume. We can be assured, however, that so long as women\r\nswim, they will not repeat history by swathing themselves with yards of\r\nfabric.\r\n\r\n\r\nU.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE: 1969",
