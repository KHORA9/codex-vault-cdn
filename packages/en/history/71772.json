On the\r\nlanding of William of Orange and the outbreak of the Revolution, the\r\nyoung Prince and his mother were sent to France, arriving at Calais\r\non 11th December (O.S.);[1] the King left England a fortnight later\r\nand landed at Ambleteuse on Christmas Day (O.S.). The château of St.\r\nGermain-en-Laye near Paris was assigned as a residence for the royal\r\nexiles, and this château was the home of the Chevalier de St. George\r\nfor twenty-four years.\r\n\r\nJames II. and VII. died on 5th September 1701 (16th Sept. N.S.), and\r\nimmediately on his death Louis XIV. acknowledged his son as king, and\r\npromised to further his interests to the best of his power.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Scots Plot, 1703.[2]]\r\n\r\nThe first opportunity of putting the altruistic intention of the King\r\nof France into operation occurred within a year of King James’s death,\r\nand the evil genius of the project was Simon Fraser, the notorious Lord\r\nLovat.\r\n\r\nLovat, whose scandalous conduct had shocked the people of Scotland,\r\nwas outlawed by the courts for a criminal outrage, and fled to France\r\nin the summer of 1702. There, in spite of the character he bore, he so\r\ningratiated himself with the papal nuncio that he obtained a private\r\naudience with Louis XIV., an honour unprecedented for a foreigner. To\r\nhim he unfolded a scheme for a Stuart Restoration. He had, he said,\r\nbefore leaving Scotland visited the principal chiefs of the Highland\r\nclans and a great number of the lords of the Lowlands along with the\r\nEarl Marischal. They were ready to take up arms and hazard their lives\r\nand fortunes for the Stuart cause, and had given him a commission to\r\nrepresent them in France. The foundation of his scheme was to rely\r\non the Highlanders. They were the only inhabitants of Great Britain\r\nwho had retained the habit of the use of arms, and they were ready to\r\nact at once. Lord Middleton and the Lowland Jacobites sneered at them\r\nas mere banditti and cattle-stealers, but Lovat knew that they, with\r\nan instinctive love of fighting, were capable of being formed into\r\nefficient and very hardy soldiers. He proposed that the King of France\r\nshould furnish a force of 5000 French soldiers, 100,000 crowns in\r\nmoney, and arms and equipment for 20,000 men. The main body of troops\r\nwould land at Dundee where it would be near the central Highlands,\r\nand a detachment would be sent to western Invernessshire, with the\r\nobject of capturing Fort William, which overawed the western clans.\r\nThe design was an excellent one, and was approved by King Louis. But\r\nbefore putting it into execution the ministry sent Lovat back to obtain\r\nfurther information, and with him they sent John Murray, a naturalised\r\nFrenchman, brother of the laird of Abercairney, who was to check\r\nLovat’s reports.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of the state of the exiled Court, that it was rent\r\nwith discord, and that Lord Middleton, Jacobite Secretary of State, who\r\nhated Lovat, privately sent emissaries of his own to spy on him and to\r\nblight his prospects.\r\n\r\nLovat duly arrived in Scotland, but the history of his mission is\r\npitiful and humiliating. He betrayed the project to the Duke of\r\nQueensberry, Queen Anne’s High Commissioner to the Scots Estates, and,\r\nby falsely suggesting the treason of Queensberry’s political enemies,\r\nthe Dukes of Hamilton and Atholl, befooled that functionary into\r\ngranting him a safe conduct to protect him from arrest for outlawry.\r\n\r\nWhen Lovat returned to France he was arrested under a _lettre de\r\ncachet_ and confined a close prisoner for many years, some records say\r\nin the Bastille, but Lovat himself says at Angoulême.\r\n\r\nThe whole affair had little effect in Scotland beyond compassing the\r\ndisgrace of Queensberry and his temporary loss of office, but it had\r\nlasting influence in France and reacted on all future projects of\r\nJacobite action. For, first, it instilled into the French king and his\r\nministers the suspicious feeling that Jacobite adventurers were not\r\nentirely to be trusted. And second, Lovat’s account of the fighting\r\nquality of the Highlanders and of their devotion to the Stuarts so\r\nimpressed itself on both the French Court and that of St. Germains that\r\nthey felt that in the Highlands of Scotland they would ever find a\r\n_point d’appui_ for a rising. Lovat’s report, in fact, identified the\r\nHighlanders with Jacobitism.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The French Descent, 1708.[3]]\r\n\r\nScotland was the scene of the next design for a restoration, and the\r\nprincipal agent of the French Court was a certain Colonel Nathaniel\r\nHooke. Hooke had been sent to Scotland in the year 1705, to see if\r\nthat country was in such a state as to afford a reasonable prospect of\r\nan expedition in favour of the exiled Stuart. In the year 1707, while\r\nthe Union was being forced upon an unwilling population, and discontent\r\nwas rife throughout the country on account of that unpopular measure,\r\nHooke was again sent, and although not entirely satisfied with all\r\nhe saw and heard, he returned with favourable accounts on the whole.\r\nAmong other documents he brought with him was a Memorial of certain\r\nScottish lords to the Chevalier, in which, among other things, it\r\nwas stated that if James, under the protection of His Most Christian\r\nMajesty (Louis XIV.), would come and put himself at the head of his\r\npeople in Scotland, ‘the whole nation will rise upon the arrival of its\r\nKing, who will become master of Scotland without any opposition, and\r\nthe present Government will be intirely abolished.’ It was some months\r\nbefore the French king gave any answer. St. Simon in his _Memoires_\r\nsays that Louis XIV. was so disheartened by his previous failure that\r\nhe would not at first listen to the suggestion of a French expedition;\r\nand it was only through the efforts of Madame de Maintenon that he\r\nwas persuaded to sanction an invading force. Even then much time was\r\nwasted, and it was not until the spring of 1708 that a squadron was\r\nequipped under the command of the Admiral de Forbin, and a small army\r\nunder the Comte de Gasse. Even when ready to sail, the constant and\r\nproverbial ill-luck of the Stuarts overtook the poor Chevalier. He\r\ncaught measles, which still further delayed the expedition. By this\r\ntime, naturally, the British Government had learned all about the\r\nscheme, and made their naval preparations accordingly. At last, on\r\nthe 17th March, James, hardly convalescent, wrapped in blankets, was\r\ncarried on board the flagship at Dunkirk. The squadron was to have\r\nproceeded to the Firth of Forth and to have landed the Chevalier at\r\nLeith, where his partisans were prepared to proclaim him king at\r\nEdinburgh. Possibly because of bad seamanship, possibly because of\r\ntreachery,[4] the French admiral missed the Firth of Forth, and found\r\nhimself off Montrose. He turned, and could proceed no nearer Edinburgh\r\nthan the Isle of May, off which he anchored. There the British Fleet,\r\nwhich had followed him in close pursuit, discovered him. The admiral\r\nweighed anchor, and fought a naval action in which he lost one of his\r\nships. He then retreated towards the north of Scotland. James implored\r\nto be set ashore even if it were only in a small boat by himself, but\r\nhis solicitations were in vain. The admiral positively refused, saying\r\nthat he had received instructions from the French king to be as careful\r\nof the Chevalier as if he were Louis himself; so Forbin carried him\r\nback to Dunkirk, where the heart-broken exile was landed on the 6th of\r\nApril, having been absent only twenty days, and having lost one of the\r\nmost likely opportunities that ever occurred for his restoration to his\r\nancient kingdom of Scotland, if not to England.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Expulsion from France, 1713.]\r\n\r\nAfter his return to France the Chevalier joined the French army. In\r\n1708 he fought at Oudenarde and Lille, and the following year at\r\nMalplaquet. His gallant conduct won golden opinions from Marlborough\r\nand his troops. The British soldiers drank his health. James visited\r\ntheir outposts and they cheered him. What Thackeray puts into the\r\nmouth of a British officer well describes the situation: ‘If that\r\nyoung gentleman would but ride over to our camp, instead of Villars’s,\r\ntoss up his hat and say, “Here am I, the King, who’ll follow me?” by\r\nthe Lord the whole army would rise and carry him home again, and beat\r\nVillars, and take Paris by the way.’[5] But James stayed with the\r\nFrench, and the war ended with the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. This\r\ntreaty gave the crown of Spain to the Bourbons, Gibraltar and the\r\nslave-trade to the British, and pronounced the expulsion of the Stuarts\r\nfrom France. A new asylum was found for the Chevalier in Lorraine,\r\nwhich, though an independent duchy, was largely under the domination of\r\nFrance. The Chevalier’s residence was fixed at Bar-le-Duc, and there he\r\nwent in February 1713.\r\n\r\nIn August 1714, on the death of Queen Anne, James made a trip to Paris\r\nto be ready for action should his presence be required, but the French\r\nGovernment sent him back to Bar-le-Duc. The death of Louis XIV. on 1st\r\nSeptember 1715 (N.S.) was the next blow the Jacobite cause sustained.\r\nThe government of France passed to the Duke of Orleans as Regent, and\r\nhis policy was friendship with the British Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Fifteen.[6]]\r\n\r\nThen came the Rising of 1715, which began at Braemar on 6th September,\r\nfollowed by the English rising in Northumberland under Forster. The\r\nmovement in England was crushed at Preston on 13th November, the same\r\nday that the indecisive battle was fought at Sheriffmuir in Perthshire.\r\n\r\nLord Mar made Perth his headquarters, and invited James to join the\r\nScottish army. The Chevalier, who had moved to Paris in October, in\r\nstrict secrecy, and in disguise, being watched by both French and\r\nEnglish agents, managed, after many remarkable adventures, checks,\r\nand disappointments, to get away from Dunkirk on 16th December (27th\r\nN.S.), and to reach Peterhead on the 22nd. Thence he went to Perth,\r\nwhere he established his Court at the ancient royal palace of Scone.\r\nHe was proclaimed king and exercised regal functions; some authorities\r\nsay that he was crowned.[7] But James had come too late; mutual\r\ndisappointment was the result. He had been assured that the whole\r\nkingdom was on his side, but he found only dissension and discontent.\r\nHis constant melancholy depressed his followers. No decisive action\r\nwas taken; the project had failed even before he arrived, and Lord\r\nMar persuaded him that he would serve the cause best by retiring and\r\nwaiting for a happier occasion.\r\n\r\nJames was forced to leave Scotland on 5th February 1716 (O.S.). He\r\nlanded at Gravelines on 10th February (21st N.S.), went secretly to\r\nParis, and concealed himself for a week in the Bois de Boulogne. Thence\r\nhe went to Lorraine, where he was sorrowfully told by the Duke that\r\nhe could no longer give him shelter. The power of Britain was great;\r\nno country that gave the exile a home could avoid a quarrel with that\r\nnation. The Pope seemed to be the only possible host, and James made\r\nhis way to Avignon, then papal territory. But even Avignon was too near\r\nhome for the British Government, which, through the French regent,\r\nbrought pressure to bear on the Pope; the Chevalier was forced to\r\nleave Avignon in February 1717, and to cross the Alps into Italy. Here\r\nfor some months he wandered without a home, but in July 1717 he settled\r\nat Urbino in the Papal States.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marriage to Clementina, 1719.[8]]\r\n\r\nFor a time the cares of the Jacobite Court were centred on finding a\r\nwife of royal rank for the throneless king. After various unsuccessful\r\nproposals, the Chevalier became engaged to the Princess Clementina\r\nSobieska, whose grandfather had been the warrior King of Poland. The\r\nSobieski home was then at Ollau in Silesia; and in October 1718 James\r\nsent Colonel Hay to fetch his bride. The British Government determined\r\nto stop the marriage if possible. Pressure was put on the Emperor, who\r\nhad Clementina arrested at Innsbruck while on her journey to Italy.\r\nHere the Princess remained a prisoner until the following April. The\r\nstory of her rescue by Colonel Wogan is one of the romances of history,\r\nand has recently been the theme of an historical romance.[9] Wogan\r\nbrought the princess safely to Bologna, and there she was married by\r\nproxy to James on 9th May 1719. While Wogan was executing his bridal\r\nmission, the Chevalier, who had almost given up hope of the marriage,\r\nhad been called away to take his part in a project which seemed to\r\naugur a chance of success.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Swedish Plot, 1716-17.]\r\n\r\nOn the collapse of the rising of 1715, the Jacobite Court, despairing\r\nof assistance from France or Spain, had turned for aid to Charles\r\nXII. of Sweden. Charles had conceived a violent hatred for George I.,\r\nwho had acquired by purchase from the King of Denmark two secular\r\nbishoprics which had been taken from Sweden by the Danes, and which\r\nhad been incorporated in the electorate of Hanover. As early as 1715\r\nCharles listened to a project of the Duke of Berwick, by which he\r\nshould send a force of Swedish troops to Scotland, but he was then too\r\nbusy fighting the Danes to engage in the scheme. In 1717 the Jacobites\r\nrenewed negotiations with Sweden, and a plan was formed for a general\r\nrising in England simultaneously with an invasion of Scotland by\r\nthe Swedish king in person at the head of an army of 12,000 Swedes.\r\nThe plot came to the knowledge of the British Government in time;\r\nthe Swedish ambassador in London was arrested; the project came to\r\nnothing; but in the following year a more promising scheme for a Stuart\r\nrestoration was formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Spanish Expedition of 1719.[10]]\r\n\r\nSpain, smarting under the loss of her Italian possessions, ceded to\r\nAustria by the Peace of Utrecht, had declared war on the Emperor and\r\nhad actually landed an army in Sicily. In compliance with treaty\r\nobligations, Great Britain had to defend the Emperor, and in August\r\n1718 a British squadron engaged and destroyed a Spanish fleet off Cape\r\nPassaro. Alberoni, the Spanish minister, was furious and determined on\r\nreprisals. He entered into an alliance with the Swedish king; a plan\r\nfor invading Great Britain was formed, and negotiations were opened\r\nwith the Jacobite Court. The death of Charles XII. in December detached\r\nSweden from the scheme, but Alberoni went on with his preparations.\r\nA great armada under Ormonde was to carry a Spanish army to the west\r\nof England, and a subsidiary expedition under the Earl Marischal was\r\nto land in north-western Scotland. The Chevalier was summoned to\r\nSpain to join the expedition, or failing that to follow it to England.\r\nThe fleet sailed from Cadiz in March 1719. James had left Rome in\r\nFebruary, travelling by sea to Catalonia and thence to Madrid and on to\r\nCorunna. He reached the latter port on 17th April, only to learn of the\r\ndispersal of the Spanish fleet by a storm and the complete collapse of\r\nthe adventure.\r\n\r\nThe auxiliary Scottish expedition, unconscious of the disaster, landed\r\nin the north-western Highlands; but after some vicissitudes and much\r\ndissension the attempt ended with the Battle of Glenshiel on the 10th\r\nof June--the Chevalier’s thirty-first birthday--and the surrender next\r\nday of the remainder of the Spanish troops, originally three hundred\r\nand seven in number.\r\n\r\nJames returned from Corunna to Madrid, where he lingered for some time,\r\na not very welcome guest. There he learned of the rescue of Princess\r\nClementina and of his marriage by proxy. Returning to Italy in August,\r\nhe met Clementina at Montefiascone, where he was married in person on\r\nSeptember 1st, 1719.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward until the end of his life, forty-seven years\r\nlater, the Chevalier’s home was in Rome, where the Pope assigned him\r\nthe Muti Palace as a residence, along with a country house at Albano,\r\nsome thirteen miles from Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Birth of Charles Edward, 1720.]\r\n\r\nIn 1720, on December 20th by British reckoning (Dec. 31st by the\r\nGregorian calendar), Prince Charles Edward was born at Rome, and with\r\nthe birth of an heir to the royal line, Jacobite hopes and activities\r\nrevived.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Atterbury Plot, 1721-22.[11]]\r\n\r\nAt this time the Jacobite interests in England were in charge of a\r\nCouncil of five members, frequently termed ‘the Junta.’ The members\r\nof this Council were the Earl of Arran, brother of Ormonde, the Earl\r\nof Orrery, Lord North, Lord Gower, and Francis Atterbury, Bishop of\r\nRochester. Of these Atterbury was by far the ablest, and in England\r\nwas the life and soul of Jacobite contriving. A great scheme was\r\ndevised, which is known in history as the Atterbury Plot. The details\r\nare somewhat obscure, and the unravelling of them is complicated by\r\nthe existence of another scheme contemporaneous with Atterbury’s,\r\napparently at first independent, but which became merged in the larger\r\ndesign. The author of this plot was Christopher Layer, a barrister of\r\nthe Middle Temple. Generally, his scheme was secretly to enlist broken\r\nand discharged soldiers. They were to seize the Tower, the Bank, and\r\nthe Mint, and to secure the Hanoverian royal family, who were to be\r\ndeported. The larger scheme of the Junta was to obtain a foreign force\r\nof 5000 troops to be landed in England under the Duke of Ormonde,\r\nand risings were to be organised in different parts of the kingdom.\r\nThe signal for the outbreak was to be the departure of George I. for\r\nHanover, which was expected to take place in the summer.\r\n\r\nLayer, who does not seem to have been acting with Atterbury and the\r\nJunta until later, was in Rome in the early months of 1721, and there\r\nhe unfolded his plan to the Jacobite Court. After he left, a plan of\r\ncampaign was arranged which, however, seems to have been modified\r\nafterwards. The original intention was to begin the movement in\r\nScotland, whither Lord Mar and General Dillon[12] were to proceed;\r\nand to accentuate the latter’s position as commander in Scotland he\r\nwas created an earl in the Scottish peerage, although already an Irish\r\n(Jacobite) viscount. Lord Lansdowne was to command in Cornwall, Lord\r\nStrafford in the north, Lord North in London and Westminster, and\r\nLord Arran was to go to Ireland. The Chevalier was to leave Rome when\r\nMar and Dillon left Paris, and to make his way to Rotterdam _via_\r\nFrankfort, and there await events before deciding where it would be\r\nbest to land. Things seemed to be prospering, but the English Jacobites\r\ndid not sufficiently respond to the call for financial support. James,\r\ndeeply disappointed, appealed to the Pope for help, only to be more\r\nbitterly mortified by his refusal. The Pope, in so many words, said\r\nthat if the English Jacobites wanted a revolution they must pay for\r\nit themselves. The original orders for invasion were cancelled in\r\nApril; but negotiations seem to have been continued with Spain through\r\nCardinal Acquiviva, Spanish envoy at Rome, ever James’s friend. A\r\nrevised plan of action was prepared. Wogan, who had been sent to Spain,\r\nhad succeeded in procuring assistance from that country; ships had been\r\nprepared to carry a force of 5000 or 6000 men to Porto Longone, in the\r\nIsle of Elba, where James was to embark. In July, James was on the\r\noutlook for a Spanish fleet under Admiral Sorano.[13] But it was too\r\nlate. The plot had been discovered, the demand for troops reaching the\r\nknowledge of the French ministers, who informed the British ambassador.\r\nSpain was compelled to prevent the embarkation, and King George did not\r\ngo to Hanover that summer.\r\n\r\nMar had used the post office in spite of a warning by Atterbury not\r\nto do so; his correspondence was intercepted, and a letter was found\r\nwhich incriminated Atterbury and his associates. Government was not\r\nhasty in acting, and the first conspirator to be arrested was George\r\nKelly, a Non-juring Irish clergyman who acted as Atterbury’s secretary.\r\nHe was seized at his lodgings on May 21st; and he very nearly saved\r\nthe situation. His papers and sword being placed in a window by his\r\ncaptors, Kelly managed during a moment of negligence to recover them.\r\nHolding his sword in his right hand he threatened to run through\r\nthe first man who approached him, while all the time he held the\r\nincriminating papers to a candle with his left hand, and not till they\r\nwere burned did he surrender. It was not until the end of August that\r\nBishop Atterbury was taken into custody and committed to the Tower.\r\nHis trial did not begin until the spring of the following year. Layer,\r\nwho was betrayed by a mistress, was arrested in September and tried\r\nin November. He was condemned to death, but was respited from time to\r\ntime in the hope that he would give evidence to incriminate Atterbury\r\nand his associates. Layer refused to reveal anything and was executed\r\nat Tyburn in May 1723, at the very time when the bishop’s trial was\r\ntaking place in the House of Lords. Atterbury was found guilty: he\r\nwas sentenced to be deprived of all his ecclesiastical benefices\r\nand functions, to be incapacitated from holding any civil offices,\r\nand to be banished from the kingdom for ever. His associates of the\r\nJunta escaped with comparatively light penalties. Kelly, sentenced to\r\nimprisonment during the King’s pleasure, was kept in the Tower until\r\n1736, when he managed to escape, to reappear later in the drama.\r\nAtterbury went abroad and entered the Chevalier’s service. He died in\r\nexile at Paris in 1732, but he was buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the schemes of Atterbury had a remarkable effect on\r\nthe unfortunate Chevalier. Apparently weary of failure and longing\r\nfor action, he wrote to the Pope on August 29th, 1722, offering to\r\nserve in a crusade against the Turks; but he was told it would not\r\ndo, he must stick to his own task. To it he accordingly returned; and\r\nimplicitly believing that his people were longing for his restoration,\r\nhe issued a manifesto dated September 22nd, proposing ‘that if George\r\nI. will quietly deliver to him the throne of his fathers he will in\r\nreturn bestow upon George the title of king in his native dominions and\r\ninvite all other states to confirm it.’[14] The manifesto was printed\r\nand circulated in England; it was ordered to be burned by the common\r\nhangman.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat remarkable that although the Atterbury Expedition was to\r\nhave been begun in Scotland, the records of the period make no mention\r\nof the project, nor do there seem to have been any preparations for a\r\nrising. The only suggestion of secret action being taken that I know\r\nof--and it is no more than a suggestion--is that in 1721, on the same\r\nday that General Dillon, who was to command in Scotland, was created a\r\nScottish earl, a peerage was given to Sir James Grant of Grant by the\r\nChevalier de St. George.[15] What the occasion of this honour may have\r\nbeen has never, so far as I know, been revealed.[16]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Affairs in Scotland.]\r\n\r\nJacobite affairs in Scotland at that time were administered by a\r\nLanarkshire laird, George Lockhart of Carnwath. Lockhart had been a\r\nmember of the old Scots Estates before the Union of the kingdoms in\r\n1707, and after the Union he sat in the Imperial Parliament until 1715.\r\nIn that year he raised a troop of horse for the Jacobite cause, and\r\nafter the rising he suffered a long imprisonment, but was eventually\r\nreleased without trial. From 1718 to 1727 he acted as the Chevalier’s\r\nchief confidential agent in Scotland. His system of Jacobite management\r\nwas by a body of trustees, which was organised in 1722, and acted\r\nas a committee of regency for the exiled king. In 1727 Lockhart’s\r\ncorrespondence fell into the hands of Government and he had to fly the\r\ncountry. He was permitted to return in the following year, but lived\r\nfor the rest of his life in retirement, and took no further part in\r\nJacobite affairs.[17]\r\n\r\nFor some years after Lockhart’s flight, Scotland seems to have been\r\nwithout any official representative of the Jacobite Court. In May\r\n1736, however, Colonel James Urquhart[18] was appointed, though under\r\ncircumstances which have not yet been made known.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed expedition connected with the Atterbury Plot was the last\r\nproject for an active campaign of restoration in which the Chevalier\r\nwas personally to embark. Scheming, of course, went on, but only once\r\nafter this did James leave Italy. In 1727, on the death of George\r\nI., he hurried to Nancy to be ready for any emergency, but the Duke\r\nof Lorraine had reluctantly to refuse him hospitality. He retired to\r\nAvignon, but, as before, the British Government brought pressure to\r\nbear, and he had to go back to Rome. Six years later, on the death of\r\nAugustus the Strong, he was offered the elective throne of Poland; but\r\nthis he declined, saying that his own country engaged his whole heart\r\nand all his inclinations, though he regretted that his second son,\r\nHenry, then eight years old, was too young to be a candidate for the\r\ncrown worn by his Sobieski ancestor.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles Edward grows up.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cause languishes.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his elder son, Charles Edward, was growing up, and the hopes\r\nof the party were fixed on his future. His father wished him to learn\r\nthe art of war, so in August 1734 he was sent to join a Spanish army\r\nunder his cousin, the Duke of Berwick,[19] who was engaged in the\r\ncampaign against Austria, which brought the crown of Naples to the\r\nSpanish Bourbons. Charles, then not quite fourteen, took part in the\r\nsiege and capture of Gaeta, a fortress in Campania, and accompanied\r\nDon Carlos in his triumphant entry into Naples as king on August 9th.\r\nThe Prince won much credit for his conduct in the field, but this was\r\nthe end of his experience of war, and his campaign had lasted only six\r\ndays. His father was anxious to extend his military education, but\r\nFrance and Spain in turn declined to allow him to serve with their\r\narmies. Even the Emperor, about to make war on the Turks in 1737,\r\nrefused to allow the young prince to accompany his army. European\r\npotentates were unwilling to receive Charles Edward even as a visitor.\r\nThe Venetian minister in London was ordered to quit England on\r\ntwenty-four hours’ notice, because his Government had shown civilities\r\nto the Prince on a visit to Venice. The British Government was too\r\nvigilant to hoodwink, too strong to offend. Peace reigned throughout\r\nEurope: Jacobite activity was dormant both in England and in Scotland:\r\nthe royal exiles were isolated at Rome, and it seemed as if all hope of\r\na Stuart Restoration had been abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Mission of Glenbucket.]\r\n\r\nThe first to inspire the Jacobite Court with new life and hope, and\r\nset in motion the events which led up to the great adventure of\r\n’Forty-five was John Gordon of Glenbucket. This remarkable man was no\r\ncounty magnate nor of any particular family. At this time he possessed\r\nno landed property; he was merely the tenant of a farm in Glenlivet,\r\nwhich he held from the Duke of Gordon. His designation ‘of Glenbucket’\r\nwas derived from a small property in the Don valley which had been\r\npurchased by his grandfather, and which he inherited from his father.\r\nHe was not a Highlander, having been born in the Aberdeenshire lowland\r\ndistrict of Strathbogie, but he had so thoroughly conformed himself\r\nto Highland spirit and manners that he had won the affection and\r\nconfidence of the Highlanders of Banffshire and Strathspey. Glenbucket\r\nwas at this time about sixty-four years old. In his younger days he\r\nhad been factor or chamberlain to the Duke of Gordon, a position\r\nwhich conferred on him considerable influence and power, particularly\r\nover the Duke’s Highland vassals. In the ’Fifteen he had commanded\r\na regiment of the Gordon retainers, and behaved with gallantry and\r\ndiscretion throughout the campaign.[20] About the year 1724 he had\r\nceased to be the Duke’s representative, but his connection with the\r\nHighlanders was continued by the marriages of his daughters. One of\r\nthem was the wife of Forbes of Skellater, a considerable laird in the\r\nHighland district of Upper Strathdon; another was married to the great\r\nchief of Glengarry; and a third to Macdonell of Lochgarry.[21]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1737 Gordon sold Glenbucket, for which he realised twelve\r\nthousand marks (about £700); and he left Scotland to visit the\r\nChevalier at Rome. On his way he passed through Paris, where he had\r\nan interview with Cardinal Fleury, the French prime minister. To the\r\nCardinal he suggested a scheme of invasion, by which officers and\r\nmen of the Irish regiments in the French service quartered near the\r\ncoast could be suddenly and secretly transported to Scotland.[22] The\r\nCardinal, whose general policy was peace at any price,[23] gave no\r\nencouragement to the scheme.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Message to the English Jacobites.]\r\n\r\nGlenbucket went on to Rome in January 1738: he delivered his message,\r\nwas rewarded with a major-general’s commission,[24] and returned to\r\nScotland. Immediately the Jacobite Court was filled with sanguine\r\nactivity. What the terms of Glenbucket’s mission were, or whom he\r\nrepresented, have never been categorically stated. Murray of Broughton\r\nhints that he only represented his son-in-law Glengarry and General\r\nAlexander Gordon.[25] Even if this limitation were true, it meant\r\nmuch. Glengarry was one of the greatest of Highland chiefs, while\r\nGeneral Gordon was that Nestor of Scottish Jacobites who had been\r\ncommander-in-chief after the Chevalier left Scotland in 1716, and\r\nwhose opinions must have carried much weight. Although there is no\r\ndirect statement of the terms of Glenbucket’s mission, its significance\r\ncan readily be understood from the communication made to the English\r\nJacobites. The Chevalier at once wrote off to Cecil, his official agent\r\nin London, informing him of the encouraging news he had received.\r\nThe zeal of his Scottish subjects, he said, was so strong that he\r\nconsidered it possible to oppose the Scottish Highlanders to the\r\ngreater part of the troops of the British Government then available,\r\nand there was good cause to hope for success even without foreign\r\nassistance, provided the English Jacobites acted rightly.[26]\r\n\r\nAt the time that the Chevalier’s message reached his adherents there\r\nhappened to be in England a personage who bore the name and designation\r\nof Lord Sempill.[27] Though of Scots descent he was French by birth\r\nand residence. He was not familiar with English ways, and he did not\r\nunderstand English political agitation. Mingling for the most part\r\nwith Jacobites avowed or secret, his ears were filled with execration\r\nof the reigning dynasty. On every side he heard the Whig Government\r\ndenounced, and he saw it tottering and vacillating. He mistook\r\ngeneral political dissatisfaction for revolutionary discontent, and\r\nhe came to the conclusion that the country longed for a restoration\r\nof the old royal line. Constituting himself an envoy from the English\r\nJacobites,[28] he hurried off to Rome and reported to the Chevalier\r\nthat the party was stronger than was generally believed, and that\r\naffairs in England were most favourable for action.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is necessary here to relate how Glenbucket’s mission to Rome\r\naffected the Scottish Jacobites, and to introduce into the narrative\r\nthe name of one who for five years was a mainstay of the Cause, though\r\nin the end he turned traitor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murray of Broughton.]\r\n\r\nJohn Murray of Broughton, a younger son of Sir David Murray of Stanhope\r\n(a Peeblesshire baronet of ancient family who in his day had been an\r\nardent Jacobite), entered the University of Leyden in 1735, being then\r\ntwenty years of age. In 1737 he had completed his studies and went on\r\na visit to Rome, where he mixed in the Jacobite society of the place.\r\nAlthough he never had an interview with James himself, he frequently\r\nmet the young princes, and he acquired the friendship of James Edgar,\r\nthe Chevalier’s faithful secretary. Murray’s father had once been\r\nproposed as an official Jacobite agent in Scotland, and it seems highly\r\nprobable that Edgar persuaded the son to look forward to assuming such\r\na position. Murray left Rome to return to Scotland shortly before\r\nGlenbucket’s arrival in January 1738.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Concert of Scots Jacobites.]\r\n\r\nGlenbucket’s message had convinced James of the devotion of the\r\nHighlanders and the Jacobites of north-eastern Scotland, but he wished\r\nto know more of the spirit of the Scottish Lowlands. At the same\r\ntime that he wrote to the English Jacobites, he despatched William\r\nHay, a member of his household, to Scotland to make inquiries and to\r\nreport. Hay overtook Murray who was lingering in Holland, and induced\r\nhim to accompany him, as he was anxious to be introduced to Murray’s\r\ncousin, Lord Kenmure, an ardent Kirkcudbrightshire Jacobite. The\r\nacquaintance was duly made, and although no record is yet known of\r\nHay’s actual transactions in Scotland, they can be conjectured with a\r\nfair amount of certainty from the results which followed them in spite\r\nof Murray’s disparaging remarks on his mission.[29] Hay visited the\r\nleading Jacobites, and it is difficult to doubt that he set in motion\r\na scheme for concerted action. What is known is that he returned to\r\nRome after three months’ absence greatly satisfied with what he had\r\nfound. In the same year, presumably as the outcome of Hay’s mission,\r\nan Association of Jacobite leaders was formed, sometimes termed ‘the\r\nConcert,’ designed with the object of bringing together Highland\r\nchiefs and lowland nobles,[30] pledged to do everything in their\r\npower for the restoration of the exiled Stuarts. These Associators,\r\nas they were called, were: the Duke of Perth; his uncle, Lord John\r\nDrummond; Lord Lovat; Lord Linton, who in 1741 succeeded as fifth\r\nEarl of Traquair; his brother, the Hon. John Stuart; Donald Cameron,\r\nyounger of Lochiel; and his father-in-law, Sir John Campbell of\r\nAuchenbreck, an Argyllshire laird. The position of manager was given\r\nto William Macgregor (or Drummond), the son of the Perthshire laird of\r\nBalhaldies.[31] In contemporary documents Macgregor[32] is generally\r\ntermed ‘Balhaldy,’[33] and that designation has been used in this\r\nvolume. Murray of Broughton did not belong to the Association, nor was\r\nhe taken into its confidence until 1741. He, however, attached himself\r\nto Colonel Urquhart, the official Jacobite agent, and assisted him\r\nwith his work. In 1740, when Urquhart was dying of cancer, Murray was\r\nappointed to succeed him.\r\n\r\nIn December 1739 Balhaldy was sent by the Associators to Paris, and\r\nfrom thence he went on to Rome. The Chevalier, greatly cheered by what\r\nhe had to tell, instructed him to return to Paris and there to meet\r\nSempill, who had become one of James’s most trusted agents. Sempill\r\nwould introduce him to Cardinal Fleury, before whom they would lay the\r\nviews of both the English and Scottish Jacobites.\r\n\r\nBalhaldy returned to Paris, made the acquaintance of Sempill, an\r\nacquaintance which subsequently ripened into a strong political,\r\nperhaps personal, friendship. The interview with Fleury was obtained,\r\nand negotiations commenced in the beginning of 1740, about three months\r\nafter the war with Spain, forced upon Walpole, had broken out.[34]\r\n\r\nIt is no part of my task to follow the intricacies of the negotiations\r\nbetween the French Ministry and the English Jacobites, except when they\r\naffect the affairs of the Scots, but here it is necessary to turn back\r\nfor a moment to relate what took place after the English Jacobites\r\nreceived the Chevalier’s communication of Glenbucket’s message from\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English reception of Scots Proposals.]\r\n\r\nSempill, who had gone from England to Rome in the spring of 1738, was\r\nsent back in October with the Chevalier’s instructions to his English\r\nadherents to arrange for concerted action with the Scots. The English\r\nJacobites formed a council of six members to serve as a directing\r\nnucleus. This council communicated the English views on the Scottish\r\nproposal to the Chevalier as follows. Although the Government, they\r\nsaid, had only 29,000 regular troops in the British Isles, of which\r\n13,000 were in England, 12,000 in Ireland, and 4000 in Scotland, yet\r\nthe rising of the Scots could not take place, as the King hoped,\r\nwithout foreign assistance. It would be a difficult matter to provide\r\nthe Scots with sufficient arms and munitions, and even if this\r\ndifficulty could be surmounted, it would take two months after they\r\nhad been supplied before their army could assemble and establish the\r\nroyal authority in Scotland; that it would take another month before\r\nthe Scots could march into England. Meantime the English leaders would\r\nbe at the mercy of the professional army of the Government which their\r\nvolunteer followers, entirely ignorant of discipline, could never\r\noppose alone. The principal royalists would be arrested in detail, and\r\ntheir overawed followers would hold back from joining the Scots. There\r\nwere 13,000 regular soldiers in England. Government would probably\r\ntransfer 6000 from Ireland, and the army would be further augmented\r\nby the importation of Dutch and Hanoverian troops. Probably 8000 men\r\nwould be sent to the frontier of Scotland. From this they concluded\r\nthat a rising in Scotland without foreign assistance would involve\r\npossible failure and in any case a disastrous civil war, while, on the\r\nother hand, the landing of a body of regular troops would provide a\r\nrallying point for the insurgents. This force should be equal to the\r\nnumber of troops generally quartered about London and able to hold\r\nthem, while the volunteer royalists would march straight to the capital\r\nwhich was ready to declare in their favour. They would then acquire the\r\nmagazines and arsenals at the seat of government, and almost all the\r\ntreasures of England (‘presque toutes les richesses d’Angleterre’). If\r\nat that juncture the Scots would rise, the Hanoverians would be driven\r\nto despair. No ally of the Elector, however powerful, would venture\r\nto attack Great Britain reunited under her legitimate sovereign.\r\nThe requirement of the English would be 10,000 to 12,000 regular\r\ntroops sent from abroad; without such a disciplined force the English\r\nJacobites would not risk a rising.[35]\r\n\r\nSempill was sent by the Chevalier to Paris to lay these views before\r\nCardinal Fleury. The Cardinal, peace lover though he was, felt that\r\nit would be absurd to neglect the assistance that the Jacobites might\r\nafford him in the complications which were certain to arise when the\r\ndeath of the Emperor Charles VI., then imminent, should occur.[36] When\r\nthe English views of requirement were presented to him he received them\r\nsympathetically; said that the King of France would willingly grant\r\nthe help the English Jacobites desired, but two things were absolutely\r\nnecessary: he must have more exact information than had been given\r\nhim with regard to what royalist adherents would join his troops on\r\nlanding, and also as to those who would rise at the same time in the\r\nprovinces. If the English leaders could satisfy His Majesty on these\r\ntwo points they might expect all they asked for.[37]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Balhaldy’s interview with Fleury.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of Jacobite affairs at the French Court when Sempill\r\nintroduced Balhaldy to Fleury. I know of no categorical statement of\r\nthe requirements that Balhaldy was to lay before the Cardinal, but from\r\na memorandum he wrote[38] it may be inferred that the Associators had\r\nasked for 1500 men with arms, ammunition, and money. Fleury replied\r\nthat his sovereign was greatly pleased with the proposals of the\r\nScots, and that he approved of their arrangements on behalf of their\r\nlegitimate king. France, however, was at peace with Great Britain,\r\nwhile Spain was at open war. King Louis would ask the Spanish Court to\r\nundertake an expedition in favour of King James to which he would give\r\nefficient support.[39] Shortly afterwards, the Cardinal was obliged\r\nto tell Balhaldy that Spain declined to entertain the proposal. The\r\nSpanish Court disliked the war with England, and was quite aware that\r\nit had been forced on Walpole by the Jacobites and the Opposition.[40]\r\nSpain was not going to embarrass the British Government by embarking on\r\na Jacobite adventure.\r\n\r\nFleury then made a proposal that the Spanish Government should finance\r\na scheme by which an army of 10,000 Swedish mercenaries should be\r\nengaged to invade Great Britain. While secret negotiation was going on\r\nbetween the French and Spanish Governments, knowledge of the proposal\r\ncame to Elizabeth Farnese, Queen of Spain. Elizabeth, fearing that\r\na successful movement for a Stuart restoration would put an end to\r\nthe war with Great Britain which she strongly favoured, inspired a\r\nparagraph in the _Amsterdam Gazette_, which exploded the design before\r\nit could be accomplished.[41]\r\n\r\nDriven at last from his hope of using Spain as a catspaw, Fleury\r\ninformed Balhaldy that his master the King, touched with the zeal\r\nof the Scots, would willingly send them all the Irish troops in his\r\nservice, with the arms, munitions, and the £20,000 asked for to assist\r\nthe Highlanders.[42]\r\n\r\nBalhaldy hurried back to Scotland with this promise and met the\r\nAssociators in Edinburgh. Although the Jacobite leaders were\r\ndisappointed that French troops were not to be sent, they gratefully\r\naccepted Fleury’s assurances, and in March 1741 they despatched the\r\nfollowing letter to the Cardinal, which was carried back to Paris by\r\nBalhaldy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lettre de quelques Seigneurs écossais au Cardinal de\r\nFleury.[43]]\r\n\r\n    MONSEIGNEUR,--Ayant appris de Monsieur le baron de Balhaldies\r\n    l’heureux succès des représentations que nous l’avions chargé de\r\n    faire à Votre Eminence sous le bon plaisir de notre souverain\r\n    légitime, nous nous hâtons de renvoyer ce baron avec les\r\n    témoignages de notre vive et respectueuse reconnaissance et avec\r\n    les assurances les plus solennelles, tant de notre part que de la\r\n    part de ceux qui se sont engagés avec nous à prendre les armes\r\n    pour secouer le joug de l’usurpation, que nous sommes prêts à\r\n    remplir fidèlement tout ce qui a été avancé dans le mémoire\r\n    que my lord Sempill et ledit sieur baron de Balhaldies eurent\r\n    l’honneur de remettre, signé de leurs mains, entre celles de\r\n    Votre Eminence au mois de mai dernier.\r\n\r\n    Les chefs de nos tribus des montagnes dont les noms lui ont été\r\n    remis en même temps avec le nombre d’hommes que chacun d’eux\r\n    s’est obligé de fournir,[44] persistent inviolablement dans leurs\r\n    engagements et nous osons répondre à Votre Eminence qu’il y aura\r\n    vingt mille hommes sur pied pour le service de notre véritable et\r\n    unique seigneur, le Roi Jacques Huitième d’Ecosse aussitôt qu’il\r\n    plaira à S.M.T.C. de nous envoyer des armes et des munitions avec\r\n    les troupes qui sont nécessaires pour conserver ces armes jusqu’à\r\n    ce que nous puissions nous assembler.\r\n\r\n    Ces vingt mille hommes pourront si facilement chasser ou détruire\r\n    les troupes que le gouvernement présent entretient actuellement\r\n    dans notre pays et même toutes celles qu’on y pourra faire\r\n    marcher sur les premières alarmes que nous sommes assurément bien\r\n    fondés d’espérer qu’avec l’assistance divine et sous les auspices\r\n    du Roi Très Chrétien les fidèles Ecossais seront en état, non\r\n    seulement de rétablir en très peu de temps l’autorité de leur Roi\r\n    Légitime dans tout son royaume d’Ecosse et de l’y affermir contre\r\n    les efforts des partisans d’Hannover, mais aussi de l’aider\r\n    puissamment au recouvrement de ces autres Etats, ce qui sera\r\n    d’autant plus facile que nos voisins de l’Angleterre ne sont pas\r\n    moins fatigués que nous de la tyrannie odieuse sous laquelle nous\r\n    gémissons tous également et que nous savons qu’ils sont très bien\r\n    disposés à s’unir avec nous ou avec quelque puissance que ce soit\r\n    qui voudra leur donner les recours dont ils out besoin pour se\r\n    remettre sous un gouvernement légitime et naturel.

We are at present taking\r\n    measures to act along with them.\r\n\r\n    As to the assistance that is necessary for Scotland in\r\n    particular, we should have preferred that His Most Christian\r\n    Majesty might have been willing to grant us French troops, who\r\n    would have renewed among us the lessons of heroic bravery and\r\n    incorruptible fidelity, that our ancestors have so often learned\r\n    in France itself, but since Your Eminence thinks fit to send\r\n    subjects of our King, we will receive them with joy as coming\r\n    from him, and we will endeavour to make them feel the value that\r\n    we attach to their devotion to our legitimate Sovereign, and\r\n    the honour that they have acquired in treading so long in the\r\n    footsteps of the best subjects and of the bravest troops in the\r\n    Universe.\r\n\r\n    The Baron of Balhaldies knows so perfectly our situation, the\r\n    plans that we have concerted, and everything that affects us,\r\n    that it will be unnecessary to enter into any detail. We implore\r\n    Your Eminence to listen to him favourably, and to be assured\r\n    that he will have the honour of reporting to you with the utmost\r\n    accuracy.\r\n\r\n    If the ministers of the Government were only less suspicious\r\n    of our actions or less watchful, we would willingly pledge all\r\n    our belongings to defray the cost of this expedition, but as no\r\n    contracts (of loan or sale) are binding by our customs unless\r\n    they have been inscribed in the public registers, it is not\r\n    possible for us to raise a sum that would be sufficient, with\r\n    the necessary secrecy that present circumstances require. It is\r\n    this consideration alone that prevents us from raising a fund for\r\n    the necessary expense, the raising of which would bear further\r\n    proof of our zeal, which we should give with pleasure, and of\r\n    the confidence with which we place ourselves under the standard\r\n    of our natural King; but the good of the service obliges us to\r\n    restrain our wishes and to have recourse to the generosity of\r\n    His Most Christian Majesty until it is possible to establish the\r\n    royal rights in our country in a regular manner.\r\n\r\n    We are persuaded that it would be possible to accomplish this\r\n    three months after the arrival of the Irish troops, and we do\r\n    not doubt that our country, reunited under the Government of its\r\n    king, so much desired, would make such efforts as would enable\r\n    Your Excellency to prove to His Most Christian Majesty that the\r\n    modern Scots are the true descendants of those who have had\r\n    the honour of being counted during so many centuries the most\r\n    faithful allies of the kings, his predecessors.\r\n\r\n    We are very sensibly touched by what Your Eminence has done, and\r\n    will continue to do, to make the Catholic king understand the\r\n    advantages that he would have in acting in favour of the King\r\n    our master in the present juncture. We had believed that these\r\n    advantages could not escape the notice of the Spanish Ministers,\r\n    but whatever strange things they may have done in the conduct of\r\n    this war, your Eminence is now acting in such a way as cannot\r\n    fail happily to extricate them from the consequences of their\r\n    mistakes, and to frustrate the unjust attitude of those nations\r\n    who are ready to fall upon the treasures of the new world.\r\n\r\n    We praise God, Monseigneur, and we pray with fervour that He\r\n    would preserve Your Eminence, not only for the accomplishment\r\n    of the great work which we are going to undertake under your\r\n    protection, but also that you may see the great and happy effects\r\n    throughout Europe as well as in the three kingdoms of Britain in\r\n    which your name will be not less precious in all time to come\r\n    than in France itself, which has been enlarged so remarkably\r\n    under your ministry; and that the glory of your name will be\r\n    raised to the highest pitch by making justice flourish among your\r\n    neighbours. We have the Honour to be, with profound veneration\r\n    and perfect devotion, Monseigneur, Your Eminence’s very humble\r\n    and obedient servants.\r\n\r\nThe promises of assistance from the French Court brought by Balhaldy,\r\nand the letter of acceptance by the lords of the Concert constituted\r\nthe treaty between France and the Scottish Jacobites which formed the\r\nfoundation of all subsequent schemes undertaken in Scotland. Even\r\nin the end it was detachments of the Irish regiments, whose use was\r\noriginally suggested by Glenbucket, together with a Scottish regiment\r\nraised later than this by Lord John Drummond, that formed the meagre\r\nsupport that was actually sent over from France in 1745.\r\n\r\nBalhaldy returned to France almost immediately, and in the winter of\r\n1740-41, he went to England where he met the Jacobite leaders, of whom\r\nhe particularly mentions the Earls of Orrery and Barrymore, Sir Watkin\r\nWilliams Wynne, and Sir John Hinde Cotton. With them he endeavoured\r\nto form a scheme of concert between the English and the Scottish\r\nJacobites, but without much success.[45]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murray taken into the confidence of the Concert.]\r\n\r\nIt was not until after the signing of the letter to Fleury that Murray\r\nwas taken into the confidence of the Jacobite leaders, and it was at\r\nthis time that he first met Lord Lovat. This was also the occasion of\r\nhis first meeting with Balhaldy; their relations at this time were\r\nquite friendly; Balhaldy handed over to Murray the negotiation of a\r\ndelicate ecclesiastical matter with which he had been entrusted by the\r\nChevalier.[46]\r\n\r\nAnother early duty was to raise money for the Cause, but to Murray’s\r\nmortification, he had to give up the scheme of a loan, because all the\r\nsympathisers to whom he applied declined to subscribe; not, they said,\r\nbecause they objected to giving their money, but each and all refused\r\nto be the first to compromise himself by heading the subscription\r\nlist. At this time Murray was not permitted to undertake any active\r\npropaganda for a rising, as the associated leaders feared that by\r\nincreasing the numbers in the secret there would be too great danger\r\nof leakage. The Associators preferred to keep such work in their own\r\nhands, and each of them had a district assigned to him.\r\n\r\nAfter Balhaldy’s departure the unfortunate Associators were kept in a\r\nstate of agonising suspense, for nothing was heard from France until\r\nthe end of 1742. In December of that year, Lord Traquair received a\r\nletter from Balhaldy couched in vague terms, assuring him that troops\r\nand all things necessary for a rising would be embarked early in the\r\nspring. The scheme, he wrote, was to make a landing near Aberdeen and\r\nanother in Kintyre. The whole tone of the letter was so confident that\r\nthe Associators felt that a French expedition might be expected almost\r\nimmediately, and they were profoundly conscious that Scotland was not\r\nready. So alarmed were the leaders at the possibility of a premature\r\nlanding, and so uncertain were they about the promises vaguely conveyed\r\nin Balhaldy’s letter, that they determined to send Murray over to Paris\r\nto find out what the actual French promises were, and how they were to\r\nbe performed; and moreover to warn the Government of King Louis how\r\nmatters stood in Scotland.\r\n\r\nMurray set off in January 1743. On his way he visited the Duke of\r\nPerth, then residing at York, making what friends he could among the\r\nEnglish Jacobites. When Murray got to London, he was informed of\r\nCardinal Fleury’s death,[47] which somewhat staggered him, but he\r\ndetermined to go on to France to find out how matters stood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murray’s visit to Paris, 1743.]\r\n\r\nOn arriving in Paris, Murray met Balhaldy and Sempill. Balhaldy was\r\nsurprised and not particularly glad to see him, but he treated him\r\ncourteously, and discussing affairs with Murray, he patronisingly\r\ninformed him that he had not been told everything. Sempill was very\r\npolite. He told Murray that a scheme had been prepared by Fleury, but\r\nthat the Cardinal’s illness and death had interrupted it.[48] Sempill\r\nalso told him that luckily he had persuaded the Cardinal to impart\r\nhis schemes to Monsieur Amelot, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. An\r\ninterview with the Minister was obtained at Versailles, and on Murray’s\r\nexplaining the reason of his visit, Amelot frankly told him that the\r\nKing of France had full confidence in the Scots, but that nothing could\r\nbe done without co-operation with the English. He further warned the\r\nScotsmen that an enterprise such as they proposed was dangerous and\r\nprecarious. The King, he said, was quite willing to send ten thousand\r\ntroops to help James his master, but the Jacobites must take care not\r\nto bring ruin on the Cause by a rash attempt. Murray was startled\r\nat Amelot’s answer after the assurances he had had from Sempill and\r\nBalhaldy of the minister’s keenness to help; he was further distressed\r\nthat some arrangements, which Sempill had confidently mentioned to him\r\nas being made, were unknown to Amelot, while the minister owned that he\r\nhad not read the Memorials, but promised to look into them.\r\n\r\nIt was on this occasion that Murray first became suspicious of the\r\nbehaviour of Balhaldy and Sempill, a state of mind which grew later to\r\nabsolute frenzy. When arranging for the interview with Amelot, they\r\nhinted very plainly to Murray that he must exaggerate any accounts he\r\ngave of preparations in Scotland. He came to the conclusion that they\r\nwere deceiving the French minister by overstating Jacobite prospects at\r\nhome, and after the interview he was further persuaded that Balhaldy\r\nand Sempill were similarly deceiving the Jacobite leaders with\r\nexaggerated accounts of French promises. He was further mortified to\r\nfind that the Earl Marischal, who was much respected in Scotland, and\r\nto whom the Jacobite Scotsmen looked as their leader in any rising,\r\nwould have nothing to do with Sempill and Balhaldy; while, on their\r\npart, they described the earl as a wrong-headed man, continually\r\nsetting himself in opposition to his master and those employed by him,\r\nand applied to him the epithet of ‘honourable fool.’\r\n\r\nApparently about this time the preparations of the English Jacobites\r\nwere languishing, and Balhaldy, proud of the Scottish Association\r\nwhich he looked upon as his own creation, volunteered to go over to\r\nEngland and arrange a similar Concert among the English leaders.\r\nHe and Murray went to London together, and there Murray took the\r\nopportunity of privately seeing Cecil, the Jacobite agent for England.\r\nCecil explained his difficulties, told him of the dissensions among\r\nthe English Jacobites, and of their complaints about Sempill, who,\r\nhe considered, was being imposed upon by the French Ministry. It is\r\ncharacteristic of Jacobite plotting to find that Murray concealed,\r\non the one side, his interviews with Cecil from Balhaldy, and, on\r\nthe other, he kept it a secret from Cecil that he had ever been in\r\nFrance.[49] Disappointed with his mission both in France and England,\r\nMurray returned to Edinburgh in March or April.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Butler’s mission to England.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Balhaldy was busy getting pledges in England and making\r\nlists of Jacobite adherents avowed and secret. Though they said they\r\nwere willing to rise, he found they absolutely refused to give any\r\npledge in writing, and he suggested, through Sempill, that the French\r\nminister should send over a man he could trust to see the state of\r\nmatters for himself. Amelot selected an equerry of King Louis’s of the\r\nname of Butler, an Englishman by birth. Under pretence of purchasing\r\nhorses, Butler visited racecourses in England, where he had the\r\nopportunity of meeting country gentlemen, and was astonished to find\r\nthat at Lichfield, where he met three hundred lords and gentlemen, of\r\nwhom, he said, the poorest possessed £3000 a year, he found only one\r\nwho was not opposed to the Government. On his return to France, Butler\r\nsent in a long report on the possibilities of an English rising. He\r\ntold the French Government that after going through part of England, a\r\ndocument had been placed in his hands giving an account of the whole\r\ncountry, from which it appeared that three-quarters of the well-to-do\r\n(‘qui avaient les biens-fonds’) were zealous adherents of their\r\nlegitimate king, and that he had been enabled to verify this statement\r\nthrough men who could be trusted, some of whom indeed were partisans of\r\nthe Government. He was amazed that the Government was able to exist at\r\nall where it was so generally hated. The secret, he said, was that all\r\npositions of authority--the army, the navy, the revenue offices--were\r\nin the hands of their mercenary partisans. The English noblesse were\r\nuntrained to war, and a very small body of regular soldiers could\r\neasily crush large numbers of men unused to discipline. It would be\r\nnecessary then to have a force of regular troops from abroad to make\r\nhead against those of the Government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French determine on an Invasion.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letter of Louis XV. to Philip V.]\r\n\r\nButler and Balhaldy returned to France in October. During their absence\r\nthings had changed; the battle of Dettingen had been fought (June 27th,\r\n1743), although Great Britain and France were technically at peace.\r\nKing Louis was furious, and he took the matter up personally, and\r\ngave instructions to prepare an expeditionary force for the invasion\r\nof England. The main body was to consist of sixteen battalions of\r\ninfantry and one regiment of dismounted dragoons, under Marshal Saxe,\r\nand was to land in the Thames. It was further suggested that two or\r\nthree battalions should be sent to Scotland. Prince Charles Edward\r\nwas invited to accompany the expedition, and was secretly brought\r\nfrom Rome, arriving in Paris at the end of January 1744. There was no\r\naffectation of altruism for the Stuart exile in King Louis’s mind, but\r\nthe zeal of the Jacobites was to be exploited. He wrote his private\r\nviews to his uncle, the King of Spain, communicating a project that he\r\nhad formed, he said, in great secrecy, which was to destroy at one blow\r\nthe foundations of the league of the enemies of the House of Bourbon.\r\nIt might, perhaps, be hazardous, but from all that he could learn it\r\nwas likely to be successful. He wished to act in concert with Spain.\r\nHe sent a plan of campaign. Everything was ready for execution, and he\r\nproposed to begin the expedition on the 1st of January. It would be a\r\nvery good thing that the British minister should see that the barrier\r\nof the sea did not entirely protect England from French enterprise.[50]\r\nIt might be that the revolution to be promoted by the expedition would\r\nnot be so quick as was expected, but in any case there would be a civil\r\nwar which would necessitate the recall of the English troops in the\r\nNetherlands. The Courts of Vienna and Turin would no longer receive\r\nEnglish subsidies, and these Courts, left to their own resources, would\r\nsubmit to terms provided they were not too rigorous.[51]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Collapse of French Expedition.]\r\n\r\nThe story of the collapse of the proposed invasion is too well known\r\nto need description. Ten thousand troops were on board ship. Marshal\r\nSaxe and Prince Charles were ready to embark. On the night of the 6th\r\nof March a terrible storm arose which lasted some days. The protecting\r\nmen-of-war were dispersed, many of the transports were sunk, a British\r\nfleet appeared in the Channel, and Saxe was ordered to tell the\r\nPrince first that the enterprise was postponed, and later that it was\r\nabandoned. Charles, nearly broken-hearted, remained on in France,\r\nliving in great privacy, and hoping against hope that the French\r\nwould renew their preparations. For a time he remained at Gravelines,\r\nwhere Lord Marischal was with him. He longed for action, and implored\r\nthe earl to urge the French to renew the expedition to England, but\r\nMarischal only suggested difficulties. Charles proposed an expedition\r\nto Scotland, but his lordship said it would mean destruction. Then he\r\ndesired to make a campaign with the French army, but Lord Marischal\r\nsaid it would only disgust the English. Charles removed to Montmartre,\r\nnear Paris, but he was ordered to maintain the strictest incognito.\r\nHe asked to see King Louis, but he was refused any audience. His old\r\ntutor, Sir Thomas Sheridan, was sent from Rome to be with him; also\r\nGeorge Kelly, Atterbury’s old secretary, who, since his escape from the\r\nTower, had been living at Avignon. He took as his confessor a Cordelier\r\nfriar of the name Kelly, a relative of the Protestant George Kelly,\r\nand, sad to say, a sorry drunkard, whose example did Charles no good.\r\nThese Irish companions soon quarrelled with Balhaldy and Sempill, who\r\nwrote to the Chevalier complaining of their evil influence, while the\r\nIrishmen also wrote denouncing Balhaldy and Sempill.\r\n\r\nCharles left Montmartre. His cousin, the Bishop of Soissons, son of\r\nthe Marshal Duke of Berwick, kindly lent him his Château Fitzjames, a\r\nhouse seven posts from Paris on the Calais road, where he remained for\r\na time. Another cousin, the Duke of Bouillon, a nephew of his mother,\r\nalso was very kind, and entertained him at Navarre, a château near\r\nEvreux in Normandy. But his life was full of weary days. He could get\r\nnothing from the French, and ‘our friends in England,’ he wrote to his\r\nfather, are ‘afraid of their own shadow, and think of little else than\r\nof diverting themselves.’ Things seemed very hopeless: the Scots alone\r\nremained faithful.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suspense in Scotland.]\r\n\r\nFrom the time that Murray left London in the spring of 1743, the\r\nJacobite Associators had received no letters from Balhaldy. The\r\nsuspense was very trying; indeed Lord Lovat felt for a time so hopeless\r\nthat he proposed to retire with his son to France and end his days\r\nin a religious house.[52] Lovat’s spirits seem to have risen shortly\r\nafter this owing to some success he had in persuading his neighbours to\r\njoin the Cause, and he eventually resolved to remain in Scotland. It\r\nwas only from the newspapers the Jacobite leaders knew of the French\r\npreparations, but towards the end of December a letter was received\r\nfrom Balhaldy, which stated that the descent was to take place in the\r\nmonth of January. Other letters, however, threw some doubt on Lord\r\nMarischal’s part of the enterprise, which included an auxiliary landing\r\nin Scotland, and once more the Jacobite leaders were thrown into a\r\nstate of suspense. They felt, however, that preparations must be made,\r\nand an active propaganda began among the Stuart adherents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murray’s interview with Prince Charles, August 1744.]\r\n\r\nIn due course news of the disaster to the French fleet reached\r\nScotland, but no word came from Balhaldy or Sempill, and it was then\r\ndetermined to send John Murray to France to find out the state of\r\nmatters. Murray tells the story of his mission in his _Memorials_.\r\nHe met Prince Charles at Paris on several occasions, and told him\r\nthat so far from there being 20,000 Highlanders ready to rise, as\r\nwas the boast of Balhaldy, it would be unwise to depend on more than\r\n4000, if so many. But in spite of this discouraging information, the\r\nPrince categorically informed Murray that whatever happened he was\r\ndetermined to go to Scotland the following summer, though with a single\r\nfootman.[53]\r\n\r\nMurray hastened home, and at once began an active canvass among the\r\nJacobites; money and arms were collected, and arrangements were made\r\nin various parts of the country. Among other expedients was the\r\nestablishment of Jacobite clubs, and the celebrated ‘Buck Club’ was\r\nfounded in Edinburgh. The members of these clubs were not at one\r\namong themselves. Some of them said they were prepared to join Prince\r\nCharles whatever happened, but others only undertook to join if he were\r\naccompanied by a French expedition. At a meeting of the Club a document\r\nwas drawn up by Murray representing the views of the majority present,\r\nwhich insisted that unless the Prince could bring them 6000 regular\r\ntroops, arms for 10,000 more, and 30,000 louis d’or, it would mean\r\nruin to himself, to the Cause, and to his supporters.[54] This letter\r\nwas handed to Lord Traquair, who undertook to take it to London and\r\nhave it sent to Prince Charles in France. By Traquair it was delayed,\r\npossibly because he was busy paying court to the lady who about this\r\ntime became Countess of Traquair,[55] but to the expectant Jacobites\r\nfor no apparent reason save apathy. After keeping the letter for four\r\nmonths he returned it in April 1745, with the statement that he had\r\nbeen unable to find a proper messenger. Another letter was then sent\r\nby young Glengarry, who was about to proceed to France to join the\r\nScottish regiment raised by Lord John Drummond for service in the\r\nFrench army. It was, however, too late; the Prince had left Paris\r\nbefore the letter could be delivered.\r\n\r\nDistressed that the King of France would not admit him to his presence;\r\nwearied with the shuffling of the English Jacobites and the French\r\nministers; depressed by Lord Marischal, who chilled his adventurous\r\naspirations; plagued, as he tells his father, with the _tracasseries_\r\nof his own people, Charles determined to trust himself to the loyalty\r\nof the Scottish Highlanders. He ran heavily into debt; he purchased\r\n40,000 livres’ worth of weapons and munitions,--muskets, broadswords,\r\nand twenty small field-pieces; he hired and fitted out two vessels.\r\nWith 4000 louis d’or in his _cassette_ he embarked with seven followers\r\nat Nantes on June 22nd (O.S.).\r\n\r\nOn July 25th he landed in Arisaig,--the ’Forty-five had begun.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPERS OF JOHN MURRAY OF BROUGHTON\r\n\r\nThese papers, picked up after Culloden, are fragmentary and are not\r\neasy reading without a knowledge of their general historical setting,\r\nand this I have endeavoured to give in brief outline in the preceding\r\npages. They are particularly interesting as throwing glimpses of\r\nlight on the origins of the last Jacobite rising. They were written\r\nbefore the collapse of that rising and before Murray, after the great\r\nbetrayal, had become a social outcast. Murray’s _Memorials_, edited for\r\nthe Scottish History Society by the late Mr. Fitzroy Bell, were written\r\nthirteen years after Culloden as a history and a vindication. These\r\npapers may be considered as memoranda or records of the business Murray\r\nhad been transacting, and they view the situation from a different\r\nangle.\r\n\r\nSome of the events mentioned in the _Memorials_ are told with fuller\r\ndetail in these papers; they also contain thirteen hitherto unpublished\r\nletters, consisting for the most part of a correspondence between\r\nMurray and the Chevalier de St. George and his secretary James Edgar.\r\nBut to my mind the chief interest of the papers lies in the fact that\r\nthey present a clue to the origin of the Jacobite revival which led up\r\nto the ’Forty-five; that clue will be found in Murray’s note on page 25.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 the Headquarters Staff of the French Army issued a monograph\r\nbased on French State Papers, giving in great detail the project for\r\nthe invasion of Great Britain in 1744, and the negotiations which\r\nled up to it. The book is entitled _Louis XV. et les Jacobites_, the\r\nauthor being Captain Jean Colin of the French Staff. In his opening\r\nsentence Captain Colin tells how the Chevalier de St. George was\r\nliving tranquilly in Rome, having abandoned all hope of a restoration,\r\nwhen about the end of 1737 he received a message from his subjects\r\nin Scotland informing him that the Scottish Highlanders would be\r\nable, successfully, to oppose the Government troops then in Scotland.\r\nIn no English or Scottish history, so far as I am aware, has this\r\nmessage from Scotland been emphasised, but in the French records it\r\nis assumed as the starting-point of the movement on the part of the\r\nFrench Government to undertake an expedition in favour of the Stuarts.\r\nMurray refers to Glenbucket’s mission in the _Memorials_ (p. 2), though\r\nvery casually, and as if it were a matter of little moment, but the\r\ninsistence in French State Papers of the importance of the Scottish\r\nmessage made it necessary to investigate the matter further.\r\n\r\nThe first step to discover was the date of the sale of the estate of\r\nGlenbucket, the price of which was probably required for the expenses\r\nof the mission, and it was found from Duff family papers, kindly\r\ncommunicated by the authors of _The Book of the Duffs_, that Glenbucket\r\nsold his estate to Lord Braco in 1737. The next step is told in the\r\npages of _James Francis Edward_, where it is narrated that Glenbucket\r\nwas in Paris about the end of that year, that he there presented to\r\nCardinal Fleury a scheme for a rising in Scotland, which he proposed\r\nshould be assisted by the Irish regiments in the service of Louis XV.\r\nThe same work tells how Glenbucket went on to Rome in January 1738,\r\nand there conveyed to the Chevalier satisfactory assurances from the\r\nHighlands, but few from the Lowlands.[56] The result was that William\r\nHay was sent to Scotland on the mission which eventuated in the\r\n‘Concert’ of Jacobite leaders, Highland and Lowland, and Balhaldy’s\r\nsubsequent mission to Paris and Rome.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to know who the Highlanders were who entrusted\r\nGlenbucket with the message to Rome. Murray, in his jealous,\r\ndisparaging way, remarks that it could only be Glengarry and General\r\nGordon, but either he did not know much about Glenbucket or he was\r\nprejudiced. In an account of the Highland clans preserved in the Public\r\nRecord Office, and evidently prepared for the information of the\r\nGovernment after he had turned traitor, Murray writes: ‘I have heard\r\nGordon of Glenbucket looked upon as a man of Consequence, whereas, in\r\nfact, he is quite the reverse. He is not liked by his own name, a man\r\nof no property nor natural following, of very mean understanding, with\r\na vast deal of vanity.’[57] But this word-portrait does not correspond\r\nwith that drawn by a writer who had better opportunities of knowing\r\nGlenbucket. The author of the Memoirs of the Rebellion in the Counties\r\nof Aberdeen and Banff particularly emphasises the affection he inspired\r\nin the Highlanders, and significantly adds:--\r\n\r\n    ‘It is generally believed he was very serviceable to the court of\r\n    Rome, in keeping up their correspondence with the Chiefs of the\r\n    Clans, and was certainly . . . of late years over at that court,\r\n    when his Low Country friends believed him to be all the while in\r\n    the Highlands.’[58]\r\n\r\nIt may be that Lovat was one of those Highlanders who joined in\r\nGlenbucket’s message. About this time he had been deprived of his\r\nsheriffship and of his independent company, and, furious against the\r\nGovernment, had almost openly avowed his Jacobitism. In 1736 he, as\r\nsheriff, had released the Jacobite agent John Roy Stewart from prison\r\nin Inverness and by him had despatched a message of devotion to the\r\nChevalier,[59] but of his co-operation with Glenbucket I have found no\r\nhint. The sequence of events here narrated make it plain that whoever\r\nit was for whom he spoke, it was Gordon of Glenbucket whose initiative\r\nin 1737 originated the Jacobite revival which eventually brought Prince\r\nCharles to Scotland.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the papers is unnecessary after the admirable introduction\r\nto the _Memorials_ by Mr. Fitzroy Bell, but it may interest readers\r\nof that work to refer to two letters mentioned in the _Memorials_.\r\nThe first of these was a letter Murray says he wrote to the Chevalier\r\ngiving an account of his interview with Cecil in London.[60] Mr. Bell\r\nsearched the Stuart Papers at Windsor, but failed to find it. I think\r\nthe letter printed on page 20 is the letter that was intended, though\r\nit is addressed not to James but to his secretary Edgar. The other\r\nletter mentioned in the _Memorials_ was one to the Earl Marischal\r\nwritten about the same time. It was entrusted for delivery to Balhaldy\r\nand Traquair, but to Murray’s intense indignation they destroyed it.\r\nIn the _Memorials_ he expresses his regret that he has not a copy to\r\ninsert. There is little doubt that the letter on page 27 of these\r\npapers is the draft of the letter referred to.\r\n\r\nThe account of the interview with Cecil (pp. 16, 21) makes pathetic\r\nreading. Murray, the Scottish official agent, fresh from seeing\r\nBalhaldy and Sempill, the official agents in Paris, is conscious that\r\nthe latter are deceiving both the French Government and their own\r\nparty. Murray conceals from Balhaldy that he is going to interview\r\nCecil; from Cecil that he has been in Paris. Cecil, on the other\r\nhand, makes only a partial disclosure of his feelings in Murray’s\r\npresence. He is contemptuous of his Jacobite colleagues, the Duchess of\r\nBuckingham and her party, and he has not a good word to say of Sempill.\r\nMurray again ridicules Cecil, of whom he has a poor opinion.\r\n\r\nHow could a cause served by such agents ever prosper?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis copy of John Murray’s papers and the three following documents\r\nwere found among some papers relating to the ’Forty-five collected by a\r\ngentleman of Midlothian shortly after the Rising. Many years ago I was\r\npermitted to copy them, and from these transcripts the text has been\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORIAL CONCERNING THE HIGHLANDS\r\n\r\nIn 1898 the late Mr. Andrew Lang edited and published a manuscript\r\nfrom the King’s Library in the British Museum, which he entitled _The\r\nHighlands of Scotland in 1750_. Mr. Lang was unable to discover the\r\nauthor, but conjectured that it was written by Mr. Bruce, a Government\r\nagent employed to survey the Highland forfeited estates after the\r\n’Forty-five. A close scrutiny of Mr. Lang’s volume along with the\r\n_Memorial_ here printed has convinced me that they are the work of the\r\nsame hand. Whoever wrote the manuscript in the King’s Library, the\r\ninformation contained therein came from the author of this ‘Memorial.’\r\nThe manuscript in the British Museum contains a good deal more than\r\nthis _Memorial_, but the views advanced are generally the same, the\r\nsentiments are similar, and occasionally the phraseology is identical.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript from which the ‘Memorial Concerning the Highlands’\r\nis printed is holograph of the Rev. Alexander Macbean, minister of\r\nInverness at the time of the ’Forty-five. Macbean was well qualified\r\nto write on this subject. I have been unable to discover the place of\r\nhis birth, but it may be conjectured that, if not actually born in\r\nthe Macbean country, his family came from there, _i.e._ that part of\r\nInverness-shire lying to the east of Loch Ness, of which The Mackintosh\r\nwas feudal superior. The earliest information that can be gleaned from\r\necclesiastical records is that he received his degree of Master of Arts\r\nfrom the University of St. Andrews in 1702, and that he was employed\r\nas schoolmaster at Fort William from 1701 to 1709. That his salary was\r\nslender may well be believed, but its tenuity was aggravated by the\r\nfact that it was not paid regularly. We find that as late as 1717 the\r\nCommission of the General Assembly applied to the Treasury for arrears\r\ndue to Macbean, and was bluntly refused on the ground that the Treasury\r\nwas not responsible for debts incurred before the Union of 1707.\r\n\r\nAlexander Macbean went from the Western Highlands to Roxburghshire,\r\nwhere he became chaplain to Douglas of Cavers, and was licensed as a\r\nprobationer by the Presbytery of Edinburgh in 1711. In the following\r\nyear the right of presentation to the parish of Avoch in the Black\r\nIsle, Ross-shire, having fallen to the Presbytery of Chanonry, _jure\r\ndevoluto_, Macbean was selected to fill the vacancy, and was ordained\r\nminister of the parish in June 1712. His appointment met with fierce\r\nopposition. His predecessor had been one of the pre-Revolution\r\nepiscopal ministers who had retained his living, and the parishioners,\r\nfor the most part episcopalians, resented his intrusion and fretted\r\nhim with litigation. He became so unhappy that he obtained permission\r\nto resign his charge. In 1714 he was presented to the rural parish of\r\nDouglas in Lanarkshire, and there he remained for six years. In 1720\r\nhe was back in the Highlands as minister of the ‘third charge’ of\r\nInverness; and in 1727 he was transferred to the ‘first charge’ of that\r\nimportant town, and there he remained until his death in 1762.\r\n\r\nIn Inverness he made his individuality strongly felt as champion for\r\nthe Government. He was ‘the John Knox of the North,’ and one who\r\nexerted himself to suppress the spirit of rebellion in and about\r\nInverness in the years 1745 and 1746.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion he nearly fell a victim to his interest in the\r\nstruggle. Having gone with many others to the Muir of Culloden to\r\nwitness the battle, one of the flying Highlanders attempted to cut him\r\ndown with his broadsword, but the blow was warded off by a bystander.\r\n\r\nAlexander Macbean was the father of a very distinguished son,\r\nLieut.-General Forbes Macbean (1725-1800) of the Royal Artillery.\r\nThis officer was educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, was\r\npresent at Fontenoy in 1745, and at Minden in 1759. At Minden he so\r\ndistinguished himself that he was presented with a gratuity of five\r\nhundred crowns and a letter of thanks from the Commander-in-Chief,\r\nPrince Ferdinand of Brunswick, written with his own hand. Forbes\r\nMacbean subsequently became Inspector-General of Portuguese Artillery,\r\n1765-69; served in Canada 1769-73 and 1778-80; but his principal claim\r\nto the gratitude of posterity is a collection of manuscript notes\r\nrecording the early history of the Royal Artillery.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Alexander Macbean’s ‘Memorial’ it is perhaps enough to say that it\r\nis, considering the times, fairly impartial, and corresponds on the\r\nwhole with authentic information gleaned from other sources. I have\r\ntaken the opportunity of supplementing, perhaps overloading, his text\r\nwith notes detailing, so far as I have been able to discover them from\r\nvarious sources, the names of the principal Highland gentlemen who were\r\nconcerned in the Rising of the ’Forty-five.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE LATE REBELLION FROM ROSS AND SUTHERLAND\r\n\r\nThe author of this narrative was Daniel Munro, minister of the parish\r\nof Tain. His origin was probably humble, as in Scott’s _Fasti_ it\r\nis stated that owing to his knowledge of the Irish (_i.e._ Gaelic)\r\nlanguage, he was educated on the Church’s charitable funds, and held a\r\nbursary from the Synod of Ross at Marischal College, and the University\r\nof Aberdeen. Munro was minister of the parish of Auldearn, near Nairn,\r\nfrom 1736 to April 1745, when he was translated to Tain, where he\r\nremained until his death in 1748. Of his life and work I have found\r\nlittle record. Andrew Henderson, the author of the Edinburgh _History\r\nof the Rebellion_, who knew this country well, says that he was ‘an\r\nuncouth man, a monster of impiety, wickedness, and ill nature.’ He\r\nfurther states that he was turned out of his church for ‘fighting and\r\nother immoralities.’[61]\r\n\r\nThis ‘Account’ is a very meagre one. The important fact in the history\r\nof Ross in the ’Forty-five was that the head of the house of Seaforth\r\nforsook the family tradition and took active part with the Government\r\nagainst the old royal family. It was a heavy blow to Prince Charles\r\nwhen Lord Macleod, eldest son of Lord Cromartie, who went to Glasgow to\r\nsee the Prince in January 1746, informed him at supper that Seaforth\r\nhad furnished two hundred men for the service of the Government.\r\nCharles turned to the French minister and gasped, ‘Hé, mon Dieu, et\r\nSeaforth est aussi contre moi!’\r\n\r\nKenneth Mackenzie, known as Lord Fortrose (which was really a Jacobite\r\ntitle), would have been the sixth Earl of Seaforth but for the\r\nattainder. His wife was Lady Mary Stewart, eldest daughter of the\r\nEarl of Galloway. She held Jacobite principles and raised many of her\r\nhusband’s clan for the Prince, while most of Fortrose’s men eventually\r\ndeserted to the Jacobites.\r\n\r\nThe principal operations in Ross and Sutherland began after Inverness\r\nhad been taken by the Jacobite army. Lord Loudoun then retired to\r\nthe shores of the Dornoch Firth. Lord Cromartie was sent in pursuit.\r\nLoudoun had boats, and when Cromartie approached him, he crossed the\r\nFirth to Dornoch. The Jacobites had to go round by the head of the\r\nFirth, whereupon Loudoun returned in his boats to the southern shore\r\nat Tain, and went back to Sutherland when Cromartie came to Ross.\r\nCromartie was superseded by the Duke of Perth. Land operations seeming\r\nto be useless, a flotilla of boats was secretly collected at Findhorn\r\nand taken to Tain under shelter of a dense fog. On March 20th, 1746,\r\nPerth crossed over the Meikle Ferry, and completely defeated Loudoun\r\nat the bloodless battle of Dornoch. Lord Loudoun, along with Duncan\r\nForbes, Sir Alexander Macdonald, Macleod of Macleod, fled to the Isle\r\nof Skye, while the chief of Mackintosh was taken prisoner.\r\n\r\nOn March 25th, the _Hazard_, a sloop of war which had been captured by\r\nthe Jacobites at Montrose four months previously and sent to France,\r\nwhen returning with money, stores, and recruits, was forced to run\r\nashore in the Kyle of Tongue by four men-of-war. Lord Reay, the Whig\r\nhead of the Mackays, took possession of the wreck and its contents,\r\nincluding 156 prisoners and £12,000, the money being sorely needed by\r\nthe army. Lord Cromartie and his son, Lord Macleod, were sent with a\r\nforce of 1500 men to expostulate with Lord Reay, and if possible to\r\nrecover the spoil. In this they naturally failed, but they continued\r\nthe march as far as Thurso, beating up for recruits and levying the\r\nland cess upon the inhabitants.[62] On the way back, Cromartie and his\r\nson paid a visit to the Countess of Sutherland at Dunrobin. There, on\r\nthe day before the battle of Culloden, they were made prisoners by the\r\nclever trick of a certain Ensign Mackay, while their followers, then at\r\nGolspie, were beaten and dispersed in an action sometimes called the\r\nbattle of the Little Ferry.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMOIRS OF THE REBELLION IN THE COUNTIES OF ABERDEEN AND BANFF\r\n\r\nThis manuscript bears neither signature nor date, and gives no\r\nindication of authorship. There can, however, be little doubt that\r\nthe author of the narrative was a minister belonging to Aberdeen\r\nor Banffshire, and that it was written at the same time as the two\r\nprevious papers, about the end of 1746 or the beginning of 1747.\r\n\r\nThe story of the events of the Rising in the north-eastern counties\r\nis recounted with much fulness of detail, and with a minute knowledge\r\nof the country and the people. It is told, moreover, with marked\r\nfairness. Although the writer is a Whig, he speaks kindly of the\r\nJacobite leaders, and he does not conceal the cruelties committed by\r\nthe Government troops.\r\n\r\nHe tells the story of the skirmish of Inverurie in greater detail than\r\nis found elsewhere, and he gives picturesque touches in places that add\r\nto the interest of his narrative. Specially graphic is his account of\r\nMacleod’s famous piper, MacCrimmon, who was captured in that action.\r\n\r\nThe condition of parties in the north-eastern counties was not what it\r\nhad been in the ’Fifteen. At that time the great lords of the counties\r\nhad been Jacobite, whereas in 1745 most of the Aberdeenshire peers were\r\nsupporters of the Government. None of them, however, took a prominent\r\nlead in the struggle. It is interesting to read the reasons given by\r\nthe author of these Memoirs for the reticence of the Whig peers. The\r\nDuke of Gordon was prevented by indisposition. Lord Findlater’s sickly\r\ncondition quite disabled him, and Lord Kintore’s incumbrances on his\r\nfortune were a drawback. Lord Forbes again had by no means an estate\r\nsuited to his ability, while Lord Saltoun had no weight in the county.\r\nAs for Lord Braco (afterwards Earl Fife), the newness of his family\r\nwould have marred any project of his forming. The author considers,\r\nhowever, that something might have been expected of the Earl of\r\nAberdeen.[63]\r\n\r\nThese explanations carry no conviction, and there can be little doubt\r\nthat, in the beginning, these Aberdeenshire lords were more or less\r\nsitting on the fence. Nor is this to be wondered at; family tradition\r\nand family connection would make them very chary of taking any\r\nprominent steps against the Jacobites. The Duke of Gordon, whose mother\r\nwas a daughter of the Earl of Peterborough, had been brought up a\r\nProtestant and a Whig in defiance of the Catholic religion and Jacobite\r\nprinciples of his predecessors. Yet he must have had some sympathy\r\nwith the family tradition. Early in September his father’s old factor,\r\nGordon of Glenbucket, carried off horses and arms from Gordon Castle\r\nwhile the Duke was there, apparently with his connivance. Moreover,\r\nSir Harry Innes of Innes in writing of this to his brother-in-law,\r\nLudovick Grant, adds: ‘I am sory to tell yow that the Duke is quite\r\nwronge.’[64] By the end of November, however, he had pronounced for the\r\nGovernment. Lord Findlater was a Jacobite in the ’Fifteen, and had then\r\nbeen imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle. Lord Kintore’s father had fought\r\nat Sheriffmuir, and been deprived of his office of Knight-Marischal as\r\na punishment. Lord Braco’s family was deeply concerned on the Jacobite\r\nside; his son-in-law, Sir William Gordon of Park, his brother-in-law,\r\nWilliam Baird of Auchmedden, his nephew, a son of Duff of Hatton, were\r\nall ‘out,’ and his eldest son was only kept by force from joining the\r\nJacobites.[65] Lord Aberdeen had only in March succeeded his father,\r\nwho, it is known, had intended to join the Stuart cause.[66]\r\n\r\nLord Forbes, whose traditions were Whig, and whose father was\r\nLord-Lieutenant of the county in 1715, might have acted, but his family\r\nconnections were nearly all Jacobite. He was the brother-in-law of Lord\r\nPitsligo and Gordon of Park, while his three daughters were married to\r\nprominent Jacobites.[67]\r\n\r\nNor on the Jacobite side were there any noted personages. The two\r\nmost prominent Jacobite leaders were Gordon of Glenbucket, a tenant\r\nfarmer, and Lord Pitsligo. Though of small estate, Lord Pitsligo was\r\nuniversally respected for his high character and his personal piety. He\r\nknew his own mind and never faltered. He had been out in the ’Fifteen,\r\nand was sixty-seven years of age. In a letter to a friend, he confesses\r\nthat what really troubled him was the fear of ridicule that a man of\r\nhis age should take part in the adventure; but he thought, and weighed,\r\nand weighed again. His enthusiasm was of the coldest kind, but duty\r\ncalled him and he obeyed. His example influenced many Aberdeen and\r\nBanffshire lairds, and he gathered a considerable contingent of horse\r\nand foot. It is related that when he was ready to start to join the\r\nPrince, and had put himself at the head of his troop, he turned his\r\nface upwards and prayed aloud, ‘O Lord, Thou knowest that our cause is\r\njust,’ and then quietly gave the order to march.[68]\r\n\r\nTo understand these Memoirs fully, it is necessary to place them in\r\ntheir historical setting, and to give a brief outline of the military\r\noperations during the campaign.\r\n\r\nOn August 31st the corporation of Aberdeen, thoroughly alarmed at the\r\nnews of the advance of Prince Charles, determined to put the city into\r\na position of defence. Lists were made of all available citizens,\r\nwho were embodied into a force of twelve companies of infantry and a\r\ndetachment of artillery, while arms and ammunition were collected for\r\ntheir equipment. Sir John Cope, who had left Inverness on September\r\n4th, reached Aberdeen on the 11th. Finding guns placed to defend the\r\nharbour and citizens fully armed, he commandeered both cannon and\r\nsmall arms, and carried them off, alleging that otherwise they might\r\nfall into the enemy’s hands. Cope left Aberdeen by sea for the Firth of\r\nForth on September 15th, the city being left without any defence.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Jacobites were not idle. Gordon of Glenbucket, now\r\naged seventy-two, had been bed-ridden for three years, but he no\r\nsooner heard of the Prince’s arrival than he experienced ‘a kind of\r\nnew life.’[69] Although bent nearly double on horseback, he hurried\r\noff to the West Highlands, and met Prince Charles at Kinlochmoidart\r\non August 18th. He was back in Banffshire raising men by September\r\n5th.[70] John Hamilton, the Duke of Gordon’s factor in Strathbogie,\r\nalso quickly raised a contingent, and ten days after Cope’s departure,\r\non September 25th, he marched into Aberdeen, where he proclaimed King\r\nJames at the Cross, and perpetrated the somewhat ludicrous outrage on\r\nthe provost and magistrates narrated on page 119. From that time until\r\nthe last week in February, Aberdeen was under Jacobite government.\r\nMen were hurriedly collected; and on October 4th Glenbucket joined\r\nPrince Charles at Edinburgh with 400 men from Strathavon and Glenlivet,\r\nHamilton also arrived in the city with 480 from Strathbogie and the\r\nEnzie. On the 9th Lord Pitsligo followed with 132 horse and 248 foot.\r\n\r\nIn the last week of October Lord Lewis Gordon, brother of the Duke of\r\nGordon, a young naval officer who had joined the Prince in Edinburgh,\r\nwas sent north as Lord-Lieutenant of the counties of Aberdeen and\r\nBanff. He found his task harder than he expected, being grossly\r\nthwarted by ‘the vile and malicious behaviour of the Prysbiterian\r\nministers.’[71] Towards the end of November, to his intense surprise,\r\nhis brother, the Duke, instructed his vassals to disregard Lord Lewis’s\r\norders.[72] In spite of discouragement, Lord Lewis worked on. Moir\r\nof Lonmay was appointed deputy-governor of Aberdeenshire and Baird of\r\nAuchmedden of Banffshire. Three new regiments were raised under Moir of\r\nStonywood (Lonmay’s brother), Gordon of Avochy (Glenbucket’s nephew),\r\nand Farquharson of Monaltrie, a cadet of Invercauld; rates and taxes\r\nwere imposed and collected; and a good deal of hardship was inflicted\r\non the lieges.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Prestonpans (September 21st) Lord Loudoun, who\r\nthere acted as Cope’s adjutant-general, had gone to London, where he\r\nreceived a commission to return to Inverness to command an army of\r\nHighlanders friendly to the Government, then being organised by Duncan\r\nForbes of Culloden.\r\n\r\nBy December Loudoun was able to send an expedition under Munro of\r\nCulcairn and Macleod of Macleod to relieve Aberdeen. Lord Lewis Gordon,\r\nreinforced by some of the French troops of Lord John Drummond, which\r\nhad landed in November at Stonehaven, Peterhead, and Montrose, met the\r\ninvaders at Inverurie on December 23rd. He defeated Macleod completely,\r\nand forced him to retire across the Spey, thus freeing Aberdeen and\r\nBanff from all enemy troops.\r\n\r\nLord Lewis now collected all his available forces and marched to\r\nStirling to join Prince Charles, who had returned from his English\r\nexpedition; and by the first week in January 1746 Aberdeen was left\r\nwithout Jacobite troops. The battle of Falkirk was fought on January\r\n17th, and on February 1st the army of Prince Charles began its retreat\r\nto the north. One column under Lord George Murray, taking the coast\r\nroad, marched through Aberdeen and on to Elgin; another proceeded by\r\nGlenshee and Braemar, occupying for a time the northern districts of\r\nthe county; the main body of the Highlanders went by Blair Atholl\r\nand Badenoch to Inverness. Two small French contingents landed at\r\nAberdeenshire ports on February 21st and 22nd, but on the 23rd the last\r\nof the Jacobite army had left the town of Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Cumberland’s army was in full pursuit. It left Perth on\r\nFebruary 20th, and the van reached Aberdeen on the 25th, the Duke\r\nhimself following two days later. The Earl of Albemarle and General\r\nBland, along with Brigadier Mordaunt, occupied Strathbogie, the\r\nJacobites retiring before them. Lord John Drummond was entrusted with\r\nthe defence of the passage of the Spey, but some troops were left under\r\nJohn Roy Stewart and Major Glascoe to carry on a guerrilla warfare.\r\nGlascoe, on March 20th, surprised a detachment of Campbell’s and\r\nKingston’s horse at Keith, and captured nearly the whole garrison.\r\n\r\nHitherto the loyal inhabitants of Aberdeen had murmured at the excesses\r\nof the Jacobite troops, but their complaints were more bitter at\r\nthe excesses of those of the Government.[73] Houses were plundered\r\nand burned, the chapels and meeting-houses of Roman Catholics and\r\nEpiscopalian non-jurors were destroyed, and the inhabitants were\r\nmore or less terrorised. In the General Order Book of the Duke of\r\nCumberland, an instance is given of the kind of punishment that was\r\nmeted out. There was a certain loyal schoolmaster in the parish of\r\nGlass, who, having learned that John Roy Stewart intended to spring\r\na surprise similar to that at Keith, warned Lord Albemarle of the\r\nintention. This warning had the effect of keeping the Government\r\ntroops on the watch for several nights. No attack was made on them,\r\nhowever, and the General, believing that the intelligence had been\r\ngiven for the purpose of harassing the troops by depriving them of\r\nsleep (although in reality he had been saved by the vigilance he had\r\nexercised as the result of the schoolmaster’s information), sent the\r\nunfortunate informer to headquarters at Aberdeen. The punishment was\r\nvery severe. In the Order Book, it is stated ‘that Peter Maconachy of\r\nGlass, convicted of spreading false intelligence in order to allarm our\r\ndefence post, to be tied to a cart and whipped and drum’d through the\r\ncantoonments of Aberdeen, Old Meldrum, and Strathbogey, with a labell\r\non his breast mentioning his crime. From Strathbogey he is to be turn’d\r\nout towards the rebells with orders never to come near where the army\r\nmay be on pain of being hanged. The woman suspected of inveigling men\r\nto list in the French service is to be carried in the same cart.’[74]\r\nOn April 8th, the Duke of Cumberland left Aberdeen, concentrated his\r\narmy on Cullen, and crossed the Spey on the 12th, when Lord John\r\nDrummond retired before him. Four days later the battle of Culloden was\r\nfought.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN DANIEL’S PROGRESS WITH PRINCE CHARLES\r\n\r\nThis narrative, written by an English officer, who served in Lord\r\nBalmerino’s regiment, is occasionally referred to by modern historians\r\nof the Jacobite period, but has never been printed. Two manuscripts\r\nare known to exist. One, which belongs to an English gentleman, was\r\nshown to me by the late Mr. Andrew Lang. It is evidently contemporary,\r\nor nearly so, but the spelling is so eccentric that it is exceedingly\r\ndifficult to read. The second manuscript is preserved at Drummond\r\nCastle, and is a certificated copy of the original, but it is written\r\nwith modern spelling. Both were put at my disposal, but as there was\r\nnothing to show that the older version was Daniel’s holograph--indeed\r\nthe evidence was against it--I preferred to use the Drummond Castle\r\ncopy. The matter in both was practically identical. Of the writer\r\nnothing is known beyond what he tells of himself. Apparently he came\r\nfrom the Fylde country of Lancashire, the district between the Lune and\r\nthe Ribble, and he was brought up in Jacobite principles.\r\n\r\nThe narrative is particularly interesting as giving the adventures of\r\nan English Jacobite. Daniel, stimulated by the call of conscience, had\r\ndetermined to embrace the cause. He had the good fortune to meet the\r\nDuke of Perth when the Prince’s army was near Preston on the march to\r\nDerby. The Duke invited him to join, offering him his friendship and\r\npatronage. Daniel accepted the offer, and he continued with the army\r\nuntil the end, when he escaped to France in the same ship as the Duke\r\nof Perth, whose death he witnessed on the voyage from Arisaig to France\r\nin the following May.\r\n\r\nOn joining, Daniel was attached to the first troop of Life Guards,\r\nof which Lord Elcho was colonel, but on the retreat from Derby he\r\nwas transferred to the second troop of the same regiment, which was\r\ncommanded by the Hon. Arthur Elphinstone, who about three weeks later\r\nsucceeded his brother as sixth Lord Balmerino. Daniel conceived a great\r\naffection and admiration for his colonel, yet in his laudatory account\r\nhe mentions a painful characteristic of the times. A gentleman, and a\r\nscholar who could recite pages from the Classics, Lord Balmerino was\r\nof a noble personage and had the courage of a lion. Moreover he never\r\nfailed in his military duties. His ‘sole and predominant passion’ was\r\nfor hard drinking. But for this weakness, ‘he would have shone with the\r\nsame lustre in the army as he afterwards did on the scaffold.’\r\n\r\nIn the narrative there is no affectation of impartiality. Daniel is\r\nconstantly comparing the iniquities of his enemies with the virtues\r\nof his friends. There is a curious incident mentioned by him when\r\nreferring to the death of Sir Robert Munro of Foulis at the battle of\r\nFalkirk. He says (page 198), ‘among the slain were . . . Sir Robert\r\nMunro, who was heard much to blaspheme during the engagement, and as\r\na punishment for which, his tongue was miraculously cut asunder by a\r\nsword that struck him directly across the mouth.’ This is rather a\r\nstartling statement concerning the end of one whom Dr. Doddridge has\r\ndepicted as a type of the Christian soldier.[75] There seems, however,\r\nno necessity to doubt the truth of Daniel’s statement as representing\r\nthe talk of the Highland camp; for it must be remembered that Sir\r\nRobert had served for many years with the army in Flanders whose strong\r\nlanguage was proverbial. With the Highlanders on the other hand,\r\nprofanity was not a common failing, and they may have been shocked at\r\nexpletives which to an old campaigner were but unmeaning commonplaces\r\nof military expression.\r\n\r\nDoddridge gives a certain amount of confirmation to Daniel’s story. He\r\ntells that when Sir Robert’s body was found the day after the battle,\r\nhis face was so cut and mangled that it was hardly recognisable.\r\n\r\nDaniel on joining the Jacobite army had been befriended by the Duke of\r\nPerth, and naturally he heartily disapproved of Lord George Murray. His\r\ndislike and distrust are shown frequently in his narrative. He tells,\r\ntoo, how his chief, Lord Balmerino, quarrelled with Lord George; how\r\nthe hardships the cavalry endured in the campaign nearly drove the men\r\nto mutiny, the blame being thrown on the general. Such unreasoning\r\naccusations must have made Lord George’s life, hard as it was, more\r\ndifficult than it would have been had officers and men been really\r\ndisciplined.\r\n\r\nThere is another charge which Daniel makes against Lord George\r\nMurray--a charge which raised much controversy amongst the\r\nJacobites--namely, the responsibility for fighting the battle of\r\nCulloden.\r\n\r\nDaniel says: ‘Contrary to the Prince’s inclination, Lord George Murray\r\ninsisted on standing and fighting that day. The Prince, notwithstanding\r\nhis great inclination to avoid fighting, was at last obliged to give\r\nway to the importunity of Lord George Murray, who even used terms very\r\ncutting in case of refusal.’ This attempt to fix the responsibility\r\non Lord George is contrary to impartial evidence, as may be seen by\r\ncareful examination of contemporary documents.[76] Lord George was\r\nagainst fighting, his scheme being to retire to the mountains, very\r\nmuch as proposed by the Marquis D’Eguilles. The Prince surely must\r\nhave known this, yet we find that while hiding in South Uist he told\r\nNeil Maceachain that ‘he blamed always my Lord George as being the\r\nonly instrument in loseing the battle, and altho’ that he, the morning\r\nbefore the action, used all his rhetorick, and eloquence against\r\nfighting, yet my Lord George outreasoned him, till at last he yielded\r\nfor fear to raise a dissension among the army, all which he attributed\r\nto his infidelity, roguery, and treachery.’ One can only surmise that\r\nin his anger against Lord George Murray, the Prince’s recollection\r\nof what had actually happened had become confused, and, surrounded\r\nby flatterers even in his flight, he had brought himself to lay the\r\nresponsibility on his Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\nThe controversy, which long raged among the Jacobites, may be set at\r\nrest once and for all from the report of the Marquis D’Eguilles to\r\nLouis XV. D’Eguilles was the accredited envoy of the King of France to\r\nthe itinerant Court of Prince Charles Edward. On his return to France\r\nafter a year’s confinement as a prisoner of war, he wrote an official\r\nreport of his mission to the French king. It is a State document,\r\npreserved in the archives of the French Government, but apparently it\r\nhas never been examined by any British historian. From the text of that\r\ndocument, an extract from which is here given, it will be seen that on\r\nthe Prince, and the Prince alone, lay the responsibility of fighting\r\nthe battle of Culloden.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French Envoy’s Official Report to Louis XV. on the Battle of\r\nCulloden]\r\n\r\n    Le prince, qui se croyait invincible, parce qu’il n’avait\r\n    pas encore été vaincu, défié par des ennemis qu’il méprisait\r\n    trop, voyant à leur tête le fils du concurrent de son père,\r\n    fier et haut comme il l’était, mal conseillé, peut-être trahi,\r\n    oubliant en ce moment tout autre projet, ne put se résoudre à\r\n    lui refuser un seul jour le combat. Je lui demandai un quart\r\n    d’heure d’audience en particulier. Là, je me jetai en vain à ses\r\n    pieds; je lui représentai en vain qu’il lui manquait encore la\r\n    moitié de son armée, que la plupart de ceux qui étaient revenus\r\n    n’avaient plus de boucliers, espèce d’armes défensives, sans les\r\n    quelles ils ne sauraient combattre avec avantage; qu’ils étaient\r\n    tous épuisés de fatigue, par une longue course faite la nuit\r\n    précédente; que depuis deux jours plusieurs n’avaient pas mangé,\r\n    faute de pain; qu’il fallait se réduire à défendre Inverness;\r\n    qu’il serait même encore plus prudent de l’abandonner et de\r\n    mettre entre les ennemis et nous la rivière, auprès de laquelle\r\n    cette ville est batie; qu’au pis-aller nous entrerions dans les\r\n    montagnes voisines; que c’était là qu’il serait véritablement\r\n    invincible; que nous y resterions les maîtres de la partie de la\r\n    côte où devait arriver le secours d’armes et d’argent que nous\r\n    attendions; que dès que nous l’aurions reçu, nous marcherions\r\n    vers l’Angleterre par cette même côte, ainsi qu’il avait été\r\n    convenu; que plus les ennemis se seraient avancés vers nous, et\r\n    plus il leur serait difficile en rebroussant chemin, d’arriver à\r\n    Londres avant nous; que c’était la prise de cette grande ville\r\n    qui devait faire son unique objet; que les succès qu’il pourrait\r\n    avoir ailleurs n’auraient jamais rien de décisif, tandis que tout\r\n    allait être perdu sans ressource dans une heure, s’il venait à\r\n    être battu.\r\n\r\n    Enfin, le trouvant inébranlable dans la résolution prise de\r\n    combattre à quelque prix que ce fût, je fis céder mon penchant à\r\n    mon devoir. Je le quittai pour la première fois, je me retirai en\r\n    hâte à Inverness, pour y brûler tous mes papiers, et y songer aux\r\n    moyens de conserver à votre Majesté la partie de ses troupes qui\r\n    ne périrait dans l’action.\r\n\r\n    Je vis avant la fin du jour le spectacle le plus frappant de la\r\n    faiblesse humaine: le prince fut vaincu en un instant. Jamais\r\n    déroute plus entière que la sienne.\r\n\r\n    TRANSLATION\r\n\r\n    The Prince who believed himself invincible because he had not\r\n    yet been beaten, defied by enemies whom he thoroughly despised,\r\n    seeing at their head the son of the rival of his father;\r\n    proud and haughty as he was, badly advised, perhaps betrayed,\r\n    forgetting at this moment every other object, could not bring\r\n    himself to decline battle even for a single day. I requested\r\n    a quarter of an hour’s private audience. There I threw myself\r\n    in vain at his feet. In vain I represented to him that he was\r\n    still without half his army; that the great part of those who\r\n    had returned had no longer targets--a kind of defensive armour\r\n    without which they were unable to fight with advantage; that\r\n    they were all worn out with fatigue by a long march made on the\r\n    previous night, and for two days many of them had not eaten at\r\n    all for want of bread; that it was necessary to fall back to\r\n    defend Inverness; that it would be even more prudent to abandon\r\n    that town, and to place between the enemy and ourselves the\r\n    river near which this town is built; that if the worst came\r\n    to the worst, we might betake ourselves to the neighbouring\r\n    mountains--there it was that he would be truly invincible; there\r\n    we would remain masters of that part of the coast, at which\r\n    supplies of arms and of money ought to be arriving, and as soon\r\n    as these reached us, we should march towards England by that\r\n    same coast as had already been arranged; that the more the enemy\r\n    should advance towards us, the greater would be their difficulty\r\n    to retrace their steps so as to get to London before us; the\r\n    capture of that great city should be made his one object, for\r\n    successes that he might achieve elsewhere would have no decisive\r\n    value, while, in a single hour, all would be lost without hope of\r\n    recovery if he should chance to be beaten.\r\n\r\n    In the end, finding him immovable in the resolve he had taken\r\n    to fight at any cost, I made my desire yield to my duty. I left\r\n    him for the first time. I retired in haste to Inverness, there\r\n    to burn all my papers, and there to think over the means of\r\n    preserving for your Majesty that portion of the [French] troops\r\n    which might survive the action. I saw before the end of the day,\r\n    the most striking spectacle of human weakness--the Prince was\r\n    vanquished in an instant; never was a defeat more complete than\r\n    his.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WANDERINGS OF PRINCE CHARLES IN THE HEBRIDES\r\n\r\nThis narrative by Neil Maceachain, the guide of Prince Charles and\r\nFlora Macdonald over the seas to Skye, appeared in the _New Monthly\r\nMagazine_ for 1840. As a magazine article three-quarters of a century\r\nold is nearly as inaccessible as a manuscript, the Council of the\r\nSociety authorised its inclusion in this volume as a fitting addition\r\nto the numerous narratives of the ’Forty-five collected by the Society.\r\n\r\nIn the magazine the article is prefaced with a note by the editor,\r\nTheodore Hook, who states that it was purchased from a hairdresser\r\nin Paris who claimed to be the son of the writer, and who, as Hook\r\nbelieved, must have been a son of Neil Maceachain. This, however, was\r\nimpossible, as Neil had but one son who survived infancy--a son who had\r\na far more distinguished career.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that when Neil died, his son was in garrison at Calais.\r\nThe father’s papers were made over to the custody of a Mr. Macnab,\r\na Highland exile residing in France. At the Revolution, Macnab\r\nwas imprisoned, his effects were seized and scattered, and Neil\r\nMaceachain’s papers were lost. Probably at that time the vendor had\r\nobtained the manuscript.\r\n\r\nMy attention was drawn to the paper about twenty years ago, and I\r\ndetermined to find out what its claims to authenticity might be. In\r\none of my journeys through the Outer Hebrides, when compiling the\r\n_Itinerary of Prince Charles_,[77] I was accompanied by the late Father\r\nAllan Macdonald, priest of Eriska and Dean of the Isles. We took a\r\ncopy of the article with us, and traced on the spot the wanderings\r\nhere described. We were much gratified; local tradition as well as\r\ntopography completely corroborated the narrative. It could only have\r\nbeen written by one thoroughly acquainted with the islands. There could\r\nbe no doubt of its genuineness, and it must have been written by Neil\r\nMaceachain.\r\n\r\nIn the _Itinerary_ there is a short account of Neil, to which the\r\nreader is referred. Briefly, he was one of the Macdonald-Maceachains\r\nof Howbeg, in South Uist, a sept of the Clanranald. Neil was educated\r\nin France for the priesthood, but abandoned his intention of taking\r\norders, and returned to South Uist, where he acted as parish\r\nschoolmaster and tutor in the family of Clanranald, who then resided at\r\nNunton in Benbecula. The old chief attached Neil to Prince Charles when\r\nin hiding in the islands, believing that his scholarship, his knowledge\r\nof languages, and his accomplishments as a musician might be useful to\r\nthe Prince.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the narrative can be accepted as trustworthy\r\nonly for the occasions on which Neil was actually with the Prince. He\r\nmet him on his first arrival at Benbecula, but he did not accompany him\r\non his journey to Harris and Lewis; he was, however, again with him on\r\nhis return to Benbecula and South Uist. Neil’s accounts, therefore, of\r\nthe Prince’s adventures when away from South Uist are only from hearsay\r\nand not to be entirely depended on. In the _Itinerary_ I followed for\r\nthat part of the Prince’s wanderings the narrative of Donald Macleod of\r\nGualtergil, who was then his companion and guide.\r\n\r\nNot the least interesting portion of the narrative is the account\r\nof the meeting between Flora Macdonald and Prince Charles. So much\r\nfiction mingles with accounts of the incident, in prose, in verse, and\r\nin pictures, that it is well to get the simple facts of the story.\r\nThere were no English soldiers in the Hebrides; the duty of hunting\r\nthe Prince was entrusted to the independent companies of Highlanders\r\ngenerally referred to as the Macdonald, Macleod, and Campbell militia.\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that the Navy was relentless in the\r\npursuit. Flora’s stepfather, Hugh Macdonald, was one of the chief\r\nmen of the Sleat Clan which supported the Government, while Flora\r\nherself was a Clanranald.[78] She had been educated in her childhood\r\nwith Clanranald’s family, and later she had been a good deal with Sir\r\nAlexander and Lady Margaret Macdonald in Edinburgh. Flora was dearly\r\nloved by both the families, and was a very suitable person to conduct\r\nPrince Charles from Clanranald territory to Skye. Moreover, the moment\r\nwas opportune, for Sir Alexander Macdonald was in attendance on the\r\nDuke of Cumberland at Fort Augustus, and Lady Margaret, who had taken\r\nthe utmost interest in the Prince and had secretly sent him comforts to\r\nSouth Uist, was at home at Monkstat.\r\n\r\nHugh Macdonald has always been suspected of collusion with the\r\nPrince,[79] but this is the only narrative in which the fact is stated\r\ncategorically. Charles declared that he felt safe while he was with\r\nthe Macdonalds.[80] Flora had but one meeting with Charles Edward in\r\nSouth Uist, on June 21st, when the plan of escape to Skye was arranged\r\n(p. 251). They met again on the evening of Saturday, June 28th, at\r\nBenbecula, whence Flora, Neil, and the Prince went by boat to Skye.\r\nSunday night was spent at Kingsburgh’s house, and the narrative breaks\r\noff at the interesting moment when the party was on the way from\r\nMonkstat to Kingsburgh. What happened after that is found in various\r\nnarratives of _The Lyon in Mourning_. Briefly, the Prince spent the\r\nnight at Kingsburgh House. Next day, he walked to Portree, changing his\r\nfemale clothes in a wood on the road. The Prince walked by private\r\npaths and Flora rode by the main highway. At Portree the Prince said\r\nfarewell to Flora for ever.\r\n\r\nSuch is the story, and it needs no embellishment. Flora’s services to\r\nthe Prince were matchless; she saved him at the moment when General\r\nCampbell with his militia and a naval expedition were on the point of\r\ncapturing him. She herself was taken prisoner a few days later.[81]\r\n\r\nAt Portree Neil Maceachain also said farewell to Prince Charles, who\r\nwith Malcolm and Murdoch Macleod went that night to the island of\r\nRaasa. The following day the Prince returned to Skye, and left two days\r\nlater for the mainland. Thus finished his wanderings in the Hebrides.\r\n\r\nNeil evaded capture after the escape of Prince Charles from Skye; in\r\nSeptember he rejoined him at Arisaig, and in the ship _L’Heureux_\r\naccompanied the Prince to France. There he joined the French army, at\r\nfirst as a lieutenant in the Regiment d’Albanie, of which the command\r\nwas given to Lochiel, and afterwards in the Scots regiment of Lord\r\nOgilvy, the Jacobite exile. Ogilvy’s regiment was disbanded after the\r\nPeace of Paris in 1763, and Neil passed the rest of his life, first\r\nat Sedan and afterwards at Sancerre, in the province of Berry, on\r\na pension of three hundred livres (about £30). He died at Sancerre\r\nin 1788. When he left Scotland Neil dropped the name of Maceachain,\r\nretaining only that of Macdonald.\r\n\r\nHis only son became famous as one of Napoleon’s generals--Marshal\r\nMacdonald, Duke of Tarentum.\r\n\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF LUDOVICK GRANT OF GRANT\r\n\r\nIn 1745 Sir James Grant was the head of the family. His father at the\r\nRevolution had taken the side of King William, and had been a member of\r\nthe Convention of Estates which declared King James’s forfeiture. He\r\nhad raised a regiment and had incurred heavy expenses in the service of\r\nthe new Government, but in spite of frequent applications no repayment\r\nhad ever been made to him. Sir James’s elder brother, Alexander,\r\nsucceeded his father. He was a distinguished soldier, who served the\r\nGovernment faithfully, and rose to the rank of Brigadier-General. In\r\nthe ’Fifteen he was Lord-Lieutenant of Banff and Inverness, and was\r\nappointed Captain of Edinburgh Castle. In 1717 he was informed that\r\nthe Government had no further occasion for his services. He died in\r\n1719, and was succeeded by his brother James, who by a special grant\r\ninherited the baronetcy of his father-in-law, Sir Humphrey Colquhoun\r\nof Luss. Sir James Grant was member of parliament for the county of\r\nInverness from 1722 to 1741, when a quarrel with Duncan Forbes of\r\nCulloden forced him to relinquish the constituency. He then became\r\nmember for the Elgin burghs, for which he sat until his death in 1747.\r\nAlthough Sir James was a Whig in politics, it may be that at one time\r\nhe had dealings with the Jacobite Court. It is remarkable that in 1721,\r\nwhile the Atterbury Plot was being hatched, and at the very time that\r\nChristopher Layer was in Rome on that business, Sir James Grant was\r\ncreated a peer by the Chevalier.[82]\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in Scotland, Prince Charles wrote to Grant requesting\r\nhis co-operation in much the same terms as he wrote to known Jacobite\r\nadherents.[83] Sir James, who was now sixty-six years old, determined\r\nto keep out of trouble. He handed over the management of his clan and\r\nproperty to his eldest son, Ludovick, and on the pretext of attending\r\nto his parliamentary duties, he went to London, where he remained\r\nthroughout the Rising.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Scotland, Sir James pointed out to his son that the\r\nfamily had received scant reward for eminent services in the past,\r\nand he advised him that whatever happened the clan should not be\r\nsubdivided. He strongly opposed Duncan Forbes’s scheme of independent\r\ncompanies. The clan should remain passive, prepared to defend its own\r\nterritory, and only act in the event of its being attacked. This policy\r\nLudovick carried out, and in doing so incurred the grave suspicion of\r\nthe Government. It is indeed difficult to believe that, until the final\r\nretreat of the Jacobites and the approach of Cumberland, the acting\r\nChief of the Grants was not sitting on the fence.\r\n\r\nThe Grant estates were in two distinct portions, those around Castle\r\nGrant in Strathspey and those in Urquhart and Glenmoriston on the\r\nwestern side of Loch Ness. Although the Strathspey Grants were\r\naccounted a Whig clan, the Grants of Urquhart and Glenmoriston were\r\nnotoriously Jacobite. When the Rising took place, Ludovick Grant wrote\r\nto his outlying retainers, not forbidding them to join the Prince, but\r\nperemptorily forbidding them to move without his sanction. Eventually\r\nthey went ‘out’ in spite of his orders, but the Strathspey men stood\r\nloyally by their chief.\r\n\r\nThe whole story of the rising in Urquhart and Glenmoriston and the\r\naction of Ludovick Grant towards the Government and his clansmen has\r\nbeen told within recent years in a most interesting volume by Mr.\r\nWilliam Mackay,[84] to which the reader is referred. The narrative\r\nprinted here is Grant’s own _apologia_ to the Government, prepared\r\nwith legal assistance after the Rising. The text tells its own story,\r\nbut four points may be referred to here, points which it gave Ludovick\r\nGrant much trouble to explain. First, when Sir John Cope marched north\r\nin August 1745 he passed within ten miles of Castle Grant, yet the\r\nyoung chief neither visited him nor sent him assistance.[85] Second,\r\nwhen President Duncan Forbes asked him to furnish two independent\r\ncompanies for the service of Government, he declined, on the ostensible\r\nground that two companies were too insignificant a contingent for so\r\nimportant a clan as the Grants. He eventually was persuaded to send\r\none company,[86] whose only service was to garrison Inverness Castle\r\nunder Major George Grant, Ludovick’s uncle. The castle surrendered to\r\nPrince Charles in February after two days’ siege, and the commandant\r\nwas dismissed the service. Third, Grant marched his men to Strathbogie\r\nto attack Lord Lewis Gordon’s men in December without orders from Lord\r\nLoudoun, then commanding in the north,[87] for which he incurred Lord\r\nLoudoun’s censure. Fourth, when Grant had gone to Aberdeen in March,\r\nfive of his principal gentlemen made a treaty of neutrality[88] with\r\nthe Jacobites under Lord George Murray and Lord Nairn, by which the\r\nPrince’s people were to get supplies from the Grant country in return\r\nfor protection from raiding.\r\n\r\nThis narrative is occasionally referred to in Sir William Fraser’s\r\n_Chiefs of Grant_, but is not included in that work. The text is\r\nprinted from the original manuscripts in the Public Record Office.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF THE REV. JOHN GRANT AND OF GRANTS OF SHEUGLY\r\n\r\nTo show his zeal for the Government after Culloden, Ludovick Grant\r\nmarched his Strathspey men, eight hundred strong, into Urquhart and\r\nGlenmoriston, and under threat of fire and sword arrested his clansmen\r\nwho had been ‘out.’ The fighting men were handed over to the Duke of\r\nCumberland, and most of them were transported. Grant of Sheugly and his\r\neldest son had not actually been out but were accused of urging their\r\npeople to join the Jacobites. They were sent to London as prisoners\r\nalong with the Reverend John Grant, minister of Urquhart. Ludovick\r\nasserted to the Duke of Newcastle that the minister ‘was at all their\r\nconsultations and never attempted to dissuade the people from joining\r\nthe rebells, but on the contrary gave over praying for his Majesty, and\r\nafter the battle of Culloden he concealed some of the rebells and had\r\ntheir money in keeping.... Mr. Grant concealed from me where three of\r\nthe rebells were hid by his direction....’[89]\r\n\r\nThe reader will find the minister’s own story in the text, and must\r\njudge of its truth. Perhaps Grant protests too much, for Mr. Mackay\r\ninforms me that the tradition of the parish is that he was a thorough\r\nJacobite. It is perfectly evident, however, that the Attorney-General\r\nand the Solicitor-General thought lightly of the case both against the\r\nminister and young Sheugly, or they would never have remitted them to\r\nthe court at Edinburgh, when it was notorious that no Scottish jury\r\nwould convict a Jacobite.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners, on December 4th, ‘sisted [surrendered] themselves\r\nin court [at Edinburgh] to answer for alleadged Rebellion and all\r\nsuch matters as on his Majesty’s behalf should be objected against\r\nthem.’[90] They were admitted to bail and there the matter ended.\r\n\r\nThe Presbytery records show that no ecclesiastical proceedings were\r\ntaken against the minister, though probably that does not mean much.\r\nAt that time it may well be believed that every minister and elder in\r\nthe Highlands sympathised with the hunted Jacobites. The only minister\r\nof the Church of Scotland who was dealt with for disloyalty in the\r\n’Forty-five was Thomas Man, minister of Dunkeld. He was tried before\r\nthe Commission of General Assembly in May 1747. The libel against him\r\nwas found relevant, and the charges partly confessed or found proven.\r\nThe sentence was gentle--five months’ suspension from his duties.[91]\r\n\r\nThe manuscript of this case is preserved in the Record Office.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROSSETT’S MEMORIAL AND ACCOUNTS\r\n\r\nWalter Grossett[92] of Logie was the grandson of a certain Alexander\r\nGrossett, or Grosier, or Grosiert, a Frenchman, who came over to Great\r\nBritain in the Civil Wars and served King Charles I. in the army. He\r\nsettled in Scotland, and died there, leaving a son Alexander. This son\r\npurchased the small estate of Logie, near Dunfermline. He was an ardent\r\nCovenanter, and retired to Holland at the time of the persecutions.\r\nAlexander left an only son, Archibald, who married Eupham Muirhead, a\r\ndaughter of the laird of Bredisholm, in North Lanarkshire, by whom he\r\nhad three sons; of these Walter was the eldest. Through his mother,\r\nhe was a cousin of Sir John Shaw of Greenock, and was also nearly\r\nconnected with the families of Lord Blantyre and the Earl of Cathcart.\r\n\r\nIn 1745 this Walter Grossett was Collector of Customs at Alloa, an\r\noffice he had held for seventeen years. He was exceedingly active in\r\nhis vocation, and very successful in the prosecution of smugglers. A\r\nshort time before the Rising, at great risk to himself, he made one\r\nof the largest seizures of smuggled tobacco ever made in Scotland,\r\nthus enriching the Treasury by several thousand pounds.[93] Early in\r\nthe ’Forty-five, eight days before Prince Charles entered Edinburgh,\r\nGrossett was commissioned by Lord Advocate Craigie to seize the boats\r\nand shipping on the northern shore of the Firth of Forth to prevent\r\ntheir falling into the hands of the Jacobite army, then assembling\r\nat Perth. Apparently his performance gave satisfaction, for he was\r\npromoted to be Collector at Leith, and he was constantly employed\r\nthereafter by the military authorities and the Lord Justice-Clerk,\r\nboth in executive work and in secret service. His services were so\r\nhighly approved by the Duke of Cumberland that H.R.H. promised him\r\n‘his countenance on every occasion.’[94] After the suppression of the\r\nRising, he was employed by the Duke of Newcastle, Secretary of State,\r\nto collect evidence for the prosecution of the rebel lords and other\r\nJacobite prisoners, and to escort the witnesses for the prosecution to\r\nLondon. For his services to Government he was promoted to the office of\r\nInspector-General of Customs in 1747, on the recommendation of the Duke\r\nof Cumberland.[95]\r\n\r\nGrossett must have been a man of great personal courage, for he went\r\nabout with his life in his hand. On one occasion, it is related, he\r\nsaved the life of his cousin Sir John Shaw by entering the Jacobite\r\ncamp (it is not stated when or where) and carrying him off in the\r\ndisguise of a Jacobite officer.[96] His enemies, whether Jacobites\r\nor smugglers, perhaps both, wreaked terrible vengeance on his house\r\nand his family, treating his wife so harshly that she died shortly\r\nafterwards.[97]\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to find on record a friendly action of Grossett to\r\na condemned prisoner. Patrick Murray, a goldsmith of Stirling, was\r\ntaken prisoner at Airdrie in November 1745 by some country people.\r\nTo Grossett, who was present, he declared that he surrendered in\r\naccordance with Marshal Wade’s proclamation of 30th October offering\r\nhis Majesty’s clemency to all rebels who would surrender before 11th\r\nNovember.[98] Grossett had been summoned to Murray’s trial at Carlisle\r\nas a witness for the defence, but was prevented from being present\r\nowing to his secret services detaining him in London. Murray was tried\r\non September 24th, 1746, found guilty, and condemned to death. The\r\nterms of his surrender were not pled at his trial, and Grossett sent in\r\na memorial stating the facts of the arrestment:[99] it was of no avail,\r\nMurray was executed on November 15th.\r\n\r\nGrossett tells the story of his executive work and of the expenses\r\nhe incurred in the pages printed in this volume. He mentions that he\r\ngave evidence in 1747 at the trial of Lord Provost Archibald Stewart\r\nfor losing Edinburgh to Prince Charles, but he does not mention the\r\nlines in which he is held up to shame and ridicule, along with the\r\nmagistrates and the clergy of Edinburgh, in a poem published after the\r\ntrial, which was burned by the hangman, and which brought the printer\r\nto the pillory and to ruin:\r\n\r\n    ‘And stupid Gr--t next must take the field,\r\n    And He, (with fifty,) swore he would not yield,\r\n    To those brave Hundreds (who deserv’d the rope,)\r\n    That did beat Thousands under Sir J--n C--pe.’[100]\r\n\r\nJudging from the report of the Duke of Cumberland’s Secretary and the\r\nSolicitor to the Treasury (p. 400), Grossett’s claim for £3709 was\r\njustified. I have, however, failed to discover if the sum was actually\r\npaid, and family papers throw some doubt on this. In a memorandum by\r\nhis eldest son it is stated that he was a sufferer for his services to\r\nGovernment by many thousand pounds. This may mean that his claim was\r\nnever liquidated, though after the report of the official scrutineers\r\nthat hardly seems probable. It is more likely that young Grossett\r\nrefers to the legal expenses incurred by his father in defending\r\nhimself against the ‘scandalous Libells and groundless and vexatious\r\nlawsuits,’ which he had to meet as the result of his anti-Jacobite and\r\nanti-smuggling zeal, together with the loss of professional perquisites\r\nreferred to on pp. 336 and 337.[101]\r\n\r\nA gauger has always been a most unpopular personage in Scotland, and\r\nGrossett rendered himself doubly odious by his action as informer\r\nagainst the unfortunate Jacobite prisoners. He was the victim of shoals\r\nof frivolous actions in the courts, brought by persons determined to\r\nwear him out in law expenses. He was strongly advised by the Secretary\r\nof State to leave the country and go abroad for a few years, and he was\r\ntold that the Treasury would give him full pay as Inspector-General\r\nduring his absence on leave. How long this leave on full pay continued\r\nI do not know, but Grossett went to Italy. His wife had been a Miss de\r\nVlieger, the daughter of a Dutch merchant and Government financier, and\r\nit may be that this fact stimulated Grossett to international financial\r\nenterprise. Along with the Earl of Rochfort, British minister at the\r\nSardinian Court, and other gentlemen, he entered into silver and copper\r\nmining adventures in Savoy, which proved utter failures. He returned to\r\nEngland a completely ruined man, and died broken-hearted, in 1760, at\r\nhis son’s house in London.\r\n\r\nWalter Grossett had been heir-presumptive to his uncle, John Muirhead\r\nof Bredisholm, the last of the male representatives of that ancient\r\nfamily and of the Muirheads of that Ilk. Muirhead had helped Grossett\r\nin his mining speculations, and had become so involved that he was\r\nobliged to sell the reversion of the estate in order to live. He wished\r\nthe property kept in the family, so he sold it to Walter Grossett’s\r\nnephew, the son of his youngest brother, James, a prosperous merchant\r\nof Lisbon, who assumed the name of Muirhead. James’s son John married a\r\ngranddaughter of Lord George Murray--Lady Jean Murray, daughter of the\r\nthird Duke of Atholl.[102] He is the ancestor of the family which, in\r\nthe female line but retaining the name of Muirhead, still possesses the\r\nproperty of Bredisholm.\r\n\r\nGrossett’s second brother, Alexander, was a captain in Price’s\r\nregiment, and served on the staff at the battle of Culloden, where\r\nhe was killed under circumstances related in the text (p. 336). His\r\nwife and children are on the list of recipients of gratuities from\r\na Guildhall Relief Fund collected for sufferers in the campaign of\r\nthe ’Forty-five (see Appendix, p. 429). The entry reads, ‘Captain\r\nGrossett’s widow and 4 children, £150.’ It was the largest individual\r\nsum distributed.\r\n\r\nGrossett’s narrative seems truthful and straightforward. Although\r\npresented in the unusual form of a commercial invoice, it is\r\nparticularly interesting and useful in giving details of minor\r\nevents of the campaign not generally mentioned, or at least not\r\ndetailed elsewhere. He, however, would convey the impression that\r\nhis enterprises were always successful, which was not the case. For\r\ninstance, the Jacobites were successful in securing the passage of\r\nthe Firth of Forth, yet Grossett does not make the reader understand\r\nthis in his long account of the operation at pp. 353-358, and the same\r\napplies to other passages. Yet the description does not differ more\r\nfrom the Jacobite accounts than in modern times do the descriptions of\r\noperations as narrated by opposing belligerent generals.[103]\r\n\r\nTwo services he was employed on are worthy of special notice--the\r\nrelease of the officers on parole (p. 364), and his participation in\r\nthe distribution of the Guildhall Relief Fund (p. 374). The former\r\nservice had been originally destined by Hawley for the company of\r\nEdinburgh volunteers under the command of John Home (author of\r\n_Douglas_), by whom it was indignantly refused.[104] The latter,\r\nwhich is described in the Appendix, is particularly interesting at\r\nthe present time of war, when similar funds are being distributed for\r\nsimilar purposes.\r\n\r\nThe manuscripts of the ‘Memorial,’ the ‘Narrative,’ and ‘The Account\r\nof Money’ are in the Record Office. A remarkable coincidence procured\r\nthe Correspondence printed on pp. 379-399. After the ‘Narrative’ was\r\nin type, my friend, Mr. Moir Bryce, President of the Old Edinburgh\r\nClub, sent me a packet of letters, most of them holograph, to look\r\nover and see if there was anything of interest in them. To my surprise\r\nand gratification, I found they were the identical original letters\r\nthat Grossett quotes as authority for his transactions. Mr. Bryce, who\r\nhad purchased the letters from a dealer, knew nothing of the history\r\nof their ownership. He subsequently generously presented me with\r\nthe collection. The Report of Fawkener and Sharpe was lent to me by\r\nMiss Frances Grosett-Collins, Bredisholm, Chew Magna, Somerset. Miss\r\nGrosett-Collins also kindly lent me some family papers from which,\r\nalong with documents preserved in the Record Office and the British\r\nMuseum, these brief notes of her ancestor’s career have been compiled.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCOUNT OF THE BATTLES OF PRESTON, FALKIRK, AND CULLODEN\r\n\r\nThis is a beautifully written manuscript of sixty-two folios, small\r\nquarto, by Andrew Lumisden, private secretary to Prince Charles when\r\nin Scotland. Certain documents bound up with the manuscript give its\r\nhistory. It was originally written for the information of John Home,\r\nauthor of the tragedy of _Douglas_, when engaged in writing his history\r\nof the Rebellion. After Home’s death, it was presented by his nephew,\r\nJohn Home, W.S., to Macvey Napier, Librarian of the Signet Library.\r\nIn 1840 Napier presented it to Mr. James Gibson Craig, W.S., because,\r\nas he says in a letter, he ‘has a just taste and value for such\r\ndocuments.’ On Mr. Gibson Craig’s death in 1886, it passed into the\r\ncollection of his partner Sir Thomas Dawson Brodie, Bart. On his death,\r\nit came into my possession by purchase.\r\n\r\nAndrew Lumisden was a grandson of Andrew Lumisden, episcopal minister\r\nof Duddingston, who was ‘outed’ at the Revolution. In 1727 the latter\r\nwas consecrated bishop of Edinburgh, and died six years later. The\r\nbishop’s third son, William, was educated for the bar, but he ‘went\r\nout’ in 1715, and, refusing to take the oaths to Government after\r\nthat Rising, he was unable to follow his profession, but practised\r\nin Edinburgh as a Writer or law agent. He married Mary Bruce, a\r\ngranddaughter of Robert Bruce, third of Kennet. To them were born two\r\nchildren, (1) Isabella born in 1719, who, in 1747, was married to\r\nthe young artist Robert Strange, whom she had induced to join Prince\r\nCharles’s Life Guards, and who afterwards became the most famous\r\nBritish engraver of his time, and was knighted by George III.; and (2)\r\nAndrew, born in 1720, the author of this ‘Account.’\r\n\r\nAndrew followed his father’s profession of Writer, and when Prince\r\nCharles came to Edinburgh in 1745 he was, on the recommendation of his\r\ncousin Sir Alex. Dick of Prestonfield, appointed private secretary to\r\nthe Prince, and accompanied him throughout the campaign. After Culloden\r\nhe was attainted. He concealed himself for some weeks in Edinburgh,\r\nescaped to London, and thence to Rouen. Here at first he suffered\r\ngreat privation, but succeeded in obtaining a French pension of 600\r\nlivres, which relieved his immediate wants. In 1749 he went to Rome,\r\nand in the following year he was appointed Assistant Secretary to the\r\nOld Chevalier. On the death of James Edgar, in 1762, he succeeded him\r\nas Jacobite Secretary of State. The Old Chevalier died in 1766, and\r\nLumisden was for a time continued in his office by Charles. The great\r\nobject of Charles’s policy was to be acknowledged by the Pope as King\r\nof Great Britain, a title which Clement XIII. refused him in spite of a\r\npowerful appeal by Cardinal Henry, Duke of York, to his Holiness.[105]\r\nCharles, smarting under the indignity, became intensely irritable,\r\nand gave himself up more and more to self-indulgence. In December\r\n1768 Lumisden, along with two other Scottish officials, was summarily\r\ndismissed for refusing to accompany his royal master to an oratorio\r\nwhen that master was intoxicated.[106] Leaving Rome, he settled in\r\nParis, where he moved in the highest literary and artistic circles. In\r\n1773 he was allowed to return to Great Britain, and five years later he\r\nreceived a full pardon.\r\n\r\nLumisden, who was never married, continued to spend much of his time\r\nin Paris, accounted ‘a man of the finest taste and learning,’ living\r\nthe life of a dilettante, and paying frequent visits to London and\r\nEdinburgh.\r\n\r\nThere is a pleasant anecdote told of him at this time, which reflects\r\nthe kindly feeling borne by King George III. to irreconcilable\r\nJacobites. It is very similar to the well-known story of King George’s\r\nmessage to Laurence Oliphant of Gask, told by Sir Walter Scott in the\r\nIntroduction to _Redgauntlet_. It must be remembered that to their\r\ndying day both the laird of Gask and Andrew Lumisden never referred to\r\nKing George except as the Elector of Hanover. The story of Lumisden is\r\ntold in a family paper[107] by his great-niece Mrs. Mure (_née_ Louisa\r\nStrange), and may be given in that lady’s own words.\r\n\r\n    A valuable library was about to be dispersed in Paris, which\r\n    contained a rare copy or edition of the Bible, and George III.\r\n    commissioned his bookseller, Mr. Nichol, to procure it for him\r\n    at a certain limit as to price. Mr. Nichol, intimate with Mr.\r\n    Lumisden, whose literary character qualified him to pronounce\r\n    as to the authenticity and value of this work, employed him to\r\n    examine, and, on approval, to make this purchase, which he did,\r\n    obtaining it at a far lower price than had been mentioned. The\r\n    king, delighted with his acquisition, asked Mr. Nichol how he\r\n    had managed to get it. Mr. Nichol replied he had ‘applied to\r\n    a friend of his much connected with literature, whom he could\r\n    trust,’ etc., etc. ‘Well, but who is your friend,’ said the\r\n    king, ‘I suppose he has a name?’ ‘A gentleman named Lumisden,\r\n    your Majesty,’ said Mr. Nichol. ‘Oh!’ replied the king, ‘the\r\n    Prince’s secretary.’ The king, with true courtesy, never called\r\n    Charles Edward aught but ‘the Prince.’ ‘Yes, your Majesty,’ said\r\n    Mr. Nichol shyly, ‘the same.’ ‘Well, Nichol,’ said the king, ‘I\r\n    am much obliged by the trouble Mr. Lumisden has taken; pray,\r\n    make him my compliments, and tell him so; and I should like to\r\n    send him some little token of this. What shall it be?’ Nichol\r\n    suggested ‘a book, perhaps,’ and it is said the king laughed and\r\n    said, ‘Oh, yes! a book, a book! that would suit you!’ However,\r\n    the message was sent, and Mr. Lumisden’s reply was, that he\r\n    should be gratified by the possession of a copy of Captain Cook’s\r\n    _Voyages_, then just published, in which he took a deep interest,\r\n    and considered they owed their success to the individual\r\n    patronage given them by the king himself.\r\n\r\n    A very handsome copy of Anson’s and Cook’s _Voyages_, in nine\r\n    quarto volumes, was sent to Mr. Lumisden by the king. They were\r\n    left by Mr. Lumisden to my father [Sir Thomas Strange], and he\r\n    bequeathed them to his son James, now Admiral Strange, in whose\r\n    possession they are. [Written in 1883.]\r\n\r\nIn 1797 Lumisden published a volume at London entitled _Remarks on the\r\nAntiquities of Rome and its Environs ... with Engravings_, his only\r\nliterary legacy excepting this account of the battles in Scotland. I\r\nhave failed to discover at what period of his life this manuscript was\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nLumisden died in Edinburgh in 1801. His usual lodging had been in the\r\nLuckenbooths, the very heart of the old town, but he had recently\r\nchanged his quarters to the then new Princes Street, and to the very\r\nnewest part of that street, the section west of Castle Street. To the\r\nimagination it seems strangely incongruous, yet as a link between the\r\npast and the present not entirely unfitting, that this aged partisan\r\nof the House of Stuart, probably the last Scottish gentleman who\r\npersonally served that dynasty whose capital was the ancient city,\r\nshould meet his death in the newest part of that modern street which is\r\nthe glory of the Edinburgh that the Stuarts never knew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINS OF THE ’FORTY-FIVE\r\n\r\nPAPERS OF\r\n\r\nJOHN MURRAY OF BROUGHTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    A COPY OF ORIGINAL PAPERS written by JOHN MURRAY, Esq., Secretary\r\n    to the Young Pretender, containing a History of the first Rise\r\n    and Progress of the Late Rebellion from the End of the year 1742\r\n    to 1744.\r\n\r\n    _N.B._--The original is written by Mr. Murray’s own hand and\r\n    was found after the Battle of Culloden, and seems to have been\r\n    originally design’d as Memoirs, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Copy of a shattered Leaf belonging to the original Manuscript_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edgar to Murray]\r\n\r\nDuring all this winter[108] my Lord T[ra]q[uai]r,[109] as I observed\r\nbefore, was at London with Lord Semple[110] and Mr. Drummond,[111]\r\nand the gentlemen in the Highlands immediately concerned in his\r\nMajesties affairs were employed in cultivating his interest amongst\r\ntheir vassals and neighbours, which was the more easily done as the\r\nmost part of that country are naturally Loyal and at the same time ...\r\nrun so high against the Government, that any scheme proposed ... was\r\nmost acceptable. It seems after his Lordship had been there sometime,\r\nhe wrote a letter to his Majestie, in answer to which I received one\r\nenclosed to me from Mr. Edgar,[112] dated the 5th of July 1742, which\r\nwas this.... It is a long time since I had the pleasure of writting\r\nto you which has been occasioned by my knowing you was informed of\r\neverything by Bahady, and that being the case I did not care to ...\r\nventure all ... time when I shall ... to say to you as I ha ... view\r\nof recommending them ... for Lord [Tra]q[uai]r to your care ... of it\r\nwith much satisfaction ... to assure you of my best respect and of the\r\nlonging I have to tell you by word of mouth how much I am yours.

As nothing is more common than for people to believe what they\r\nwish and hope for, however specious the encouragement may be. Upon\r\nMr. Drummond parting with His Lordship at London, he assured him he\r\nwould write particularly whatever Resolutions the Cardinal[113] should\r\ncome to after his arrival, imagining, as he said, that the promises\r\nthey had gott in England from the King’s friends there would suffice\r\nto determine the old man to act strenuously in his Majesty’s favours;\r\nupon which we waited impatiently to hear from him. In the beginning of\r\nWinter Locheal came to town with whom I had occasion often to converse\r\non these subjects, and always found him the man the most ready, and\r\nwilling chearfully to enter into any scheme that would conduce to His\r\nMajesty’s interest: and must here declare that I really believe he is\r\nthe most sincere honest man the Country produces, without the least\r\nshew of self interest. After several months had passed without my\r\nhearing from Rome, or any letters coming from My L[ord] T[ra]q[uai]r\r\nreceived one from Mr. Drummond about the beginning of December and\r\ndated . . . of . . . which alarmed us very much, as it gave us ground\r\nto believe that things were much nearer Action, than we had any notion\r\nof, and indeed it seemed to us only fitt to be written a few weeks\r\nbefore a descent; but to make the reader Judge, I shall here insert a\r\nletter itself.\r\n\r\nCopy Mr. Drummond’s letter to the Earl of T[ra]q[uai]r dated\r\nthe     1742.\r\n\r\n_The rest awanting._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Copy of another torn Leaf in Manuscripts_\r\n\r\nAs there was nothing in this letter but a general assurance of the\r\nFrench Design without either specyfying the number of the Troops,\r\nArms, Money, Ammunition or even the fixed time, My Lord T[ra]q[uai]r\r\nand the Laird of Lochiel[114] considering how unprepared the Country\r\nwas to join in any such attack attempt, and that from the contents of\r\nthe letter it was impossible to give any positive directions to the\r\nGentlemen of the Highlands, together with the near prospect they had of\r\na landing, which must of necessity have proved abortive had it really\r\nhappened. They thought it absolutely necessary they should be presently\r\ninformed of everything, but the difficulty was how to accomplish it.\r\nThere was no opportunity to write, the time of an answer uncertain,\r\nand from the indistinct letter already received they had no great\r\nreason to expect anything in writing very satisfactory ... upon which I\r\noffered to go ... and then learn distinctly ... the Resolutions of the\r\n... fully informed ... but as this was not to ... having the opinion\r\nof ... who were the most ... in his Majesties Interest ... a letter\r\nwrote by ... which went to him by ... likewise one to S[ir] J[ames]\r\nC[ampbell][115] their advice and opinion, and during the intervall we\r\nhad severall conversations all tending to acquaint us particularly\r\nof what had been carried on for sometime before by Lord Semple, Mr.\r\nDrummond and then received by me as one of these who had been the first\r\nin the Country to form a Concert, binding themselves by oath not to\r\ndiscover their schemes to any but one of themselves, or the persons\r\nagreed upon to be received amongst them by the Consent of the whole.\r\n\r\nI had for a long time before been pretty well acquainted with who were\r\nthe principle people concerned in all the present transactions, without\r\nknowing there had ever been any such formal Combination. I gave my\r\nword of honour faithfully to keep these secrets, and then they told\r\nme the rise of the Story what assurances they had given the French by\r\nthe hands of Drummond and Lord Semple after making terms with the King\r\nhimself, that nobody should be acquented with their procedure without\r\ntheir consent. I was like wise informed\r\n\r\n_The rest of this Page not legible._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weather at this time happening to be very stormy, the express did\r\nnot return for two weeks longer than we expected; but upon receiving\r\nhis Lordships answer which he approved of the proposal, I sett about\r\nmaking ready to sett off, and accordingly took journey about the 10\r\nor 12 of Jany. 1743, upon the pretence of talking with the Duke of\r\nQueensberry[116] then at London concerning a process I had with the\r\nEarl of March,[117] to whom his Grace had been Tutor-in-law.\r\n\r\nOn the Friday I left Edinburgh and went to Traquair and so through\r\nTweeddale to York, where I stop’d to talk to the D[uke] of P[erth]\r\none of the Concert, and acquaint him with my journey and received\r\nhis commands. The principal part of my transactions was to make\r\nmyself fully acquainted with the French Resolutions, to give them all\r\nencouragement possible, and to write to his Majesty acquainting him\r\nthat the Gentleman in the Highlands being informed that my L[ord]\r\nM[arischal],[118] whom his Majesty had honoured with the Command, was a\r\nman of a very high and forbidding manner, and exceedingly positive in\r\nhis way, they were afraid least such procedure might create differences\r\nand heart burnings amongst them; wherefore he prayed his Majesty would\r\nsend over General Keith,[119] who they understood was of a very mild\r\nand humane temper and in whose abilitys they had great confidence.\r\nWhen I came to York his Grace the D[uke] of P[erth] approved highly of\r\nmy going over and gave me a great many injunctions[120] how to write\r\nto the King, which is needless here to put down as they all tended\r\nto prevent differences in case matters came to be put in execution.\r\nI then went to London, where I only stayed some few days, and sett\r\nout of on Munday about 12 o’clock to Dover where I arrived the same\r\nnight about 9 o’clock, and found a Packet ready to sail. As the wind\r\nwas then pretty fair, I was in hopes of getting next morning pretty\r\nearly to Calais, but it changed a little after we was at sea, so were\r\noblidged to make for Boulogne, this made me exceedingly uneasy as I\r\nwas instructed to go privately to Paris without the knowledge of any\r\nof the people who were at Boulogne, and now in all probability we were\r\nto land in broad daylight where I must infallibly have been known; but\r\nluckily we were becalmed all that day, and did not arrive till about\r\nthree in the morning. I stayed there till about five, when I got a\r\nchaise and set out for Paris, where I came on Friday morning and went\r\nto McDonald’s the Banquier,[121] and enquired for Mr. Maxwell, which\r\nwas the name Drummond then went by. I immediately went to him this same\r\nday before dinner, and found him greatly surprised at my Coming, but\r\nsaid it was very lucky as it might be a mean to quicken the French in\r\nproceeding; when they saw how forward and anxious the Country was to\r\ncome to action. Upon my arrival at London I heard of Cardinal Fleury’s\r\ndeath, which was a very unlucky incident; for these two Gentlemen had\r\nit left in their power to assert, that had not that happened, every\r\nthing would certainly have been performed, and not then in my power to\r\nadvance anything positively to the contrary. I went with Mr. Drummond\r\nin the evening to Lord Semple who I had never seen before: he received\r\nme very civily and enquired about the situation of the Country which I\r\ntold him was very favourable; but as the letter Mr. Drummond had wrote,\r\ngave us to understand that the Cardinal had determined to put things\r\nin execution sooner than we had any cause to expect, never having had\r\nanything encouraging before, and that by that letter, we was told of no\r\nparticulars, it was judged necessary I should come over to know how\r\nthings were to be executed: and particularly, what assurances of every\r\nkind we might depend upon; so as the Gentlemen of the concert might be\r\nable upon my return to sett immediately about preparing the Country\r\nfor their reception. He then agreed with Mr. Drummond that my coming\r\nover was well timed, but that he was afraid it might require some time\r\nbefore the French could be brought into it, as in all probability their\r\nschemes would be entirely altered by the Cardinal’s death; that all\r\nhis views consisted in keeping peace, but that there was a party of\r\nyounger people about court, who had gained a good deal upon the King,\r\nwhich together with his own natural disposition and heat of youth\r\ninclined him to war. At the same time he said it was lucky that he had\r\nobserved the Cardinal’s Decline, and had persuaded him to impart all\r\nthe affairs that concerned this Country to Mr. Amalot,[122] by which\r\nmeans they would be but little stop as to the King or Ministery being\r\nacquainted with whatever related to us, as Mr. Amalot was continued as\r\nMinister of Forreign Affairs. A great deal more of this kind passed,\r\nand upon my not being able to tell them minutly what every individual\r\nof the Concert had done in the particular District alotted them, Mr.\r\nDrummond complained that I had not been fully informed of all their\r\nScheme. I in the meanwhile did not reflect upon the Cause of his making\r\nsuch reflections against Lord T[ra]q[uai]r, who was the person that\r\ninformed me of their Concert; but it has often occurred to me since,\r\nthat they laid great stress on all the little pieces of information\r\nthey gott of the Gentlemen’s procedure in Scotland, and everything\r\nthey gott took care to make a mighty matter of it to the King: and Mr.\r\nDrummond did not fail as he has often told me himself, to write in the\r\nstrongest terms to his Majesty, of their great success, which he knew\r\nmust always redound so far to his advantage, as he had taken care to\r\nmake the King believe he was the person who had sett all in motion, and\r\nthat it was upon his plan that they acted, and their success mostly\r\nowing to following the Scheme he had laid down to them. I then told\r\nthem it would be necessary as the Cardinal was now dead that I saw Mr.\r\nAmalot, and heard what Resolutions they had taken, to be able to inform\r\nthe King’s friends of what was to be expected. Lord Semple told me that\r\nMr. Amalot was then at Versailes, but would be in town on Sunday when\r\nhe would talk to him, and inform him of my being sent over, and gett\r\nhim to fix a time when I might have an audience, he accordingly was\r\nwith him on the Sunday and, as he told me the same evening, could not\r\nsee him for ... and when he did tell him, he took it very ill that he\r\nhad been made wait so long in his Out-chamber; that although his Master\r\nwas not upon the Throne and so did not keep his Ministers publickly at\r\nCourt, yet he thought using these he employed in his service in that\r\nshape was treating him ill and not like a Prince as he really was. That\r\nMr. Amalot made excuses from his being so little in Paris all week,\r\nand consequently hurryed all the while he was there; but fixed no time\r\nwhen to see me, so his Lordship went by himself to Versailes that week,\r\nwhere he stayed a night or two and returned to town. I went out some\r\ndays after along with him and Mr. Drumond to see Mr. Amalot who was\r\nfirst to talk to with the King and then return me his Majesty’s answer,\r\nbut was told from day to day, that he could not have an opportunity\r\nof talking with the King. So was oblidged to return to Paris without\r\nseeing him.\r\n\r\nI wrote a pretty long letter to the King acquainting him with the\r\nreasons of my coming over and hoping his Majesty would pardon my\r\nleaving the Country without his Permission, but not to be too tedious\r\nby mentioning all the different conversations I had with his Lordship\r\nand Mr. Drummond during my stay which were all to the same purpose,\r\ntogether with the most severe Reflections and Invectives against the\r\nDutches of Buckingham[123] and Lord Marshal with Coll Cecel,[124] Coll\r\nBrette[125] and Ch. Smith[126] and all those who were of a contrary\r\nparty from them, alledging it was entirely owing to their having given\r\nin Ridiculous Schemes to the Cardinal demanding vast numbers of men,\r\nmoney, cannon, etc., sufficient to conquer the Country, which made the\r\nOld man have a mean opinion of the power of the King’s party and put\r\na stop to his realy putting in execution ... required of him; and at\r\nthe same time assuring me that these people were most unjust to the\r\nCardinal in alledging that he was not hearty and sincere in the King’s\r\ninterest, for that he had often professed that he would willingly lose\r\nhis own life in the cause, that there was nothing he had so much at\r\nheart next to the Interest of his own Master, and that he had even\r\ncryed[127] with concern in speaking of the misfortunes of the King’s\r\nfamily, and notwithstanding he had a very mean opinion of the other\r\nparty, yet the Memorials they had given instruct him so much that it\r\ncost Lord Semple the utmost[128] pains and trouble to perswade him of\r\nthe contrary, but they had after some time succeeded so effectually\r\nthat he was determined to send over a body of troops to England and\r\ndesigned Mr. Mailebois[129] should return to Flanders for that purpose;\r\nbut that the party at Court which opposed him had influenced the\r\nKing to make him march his Army into Westphalia which occasioned the\r\nNeutrality for Hannover; that this was so opposite to his Schemes,\r\nand he was sensible that a general war must ensue, and France thereby\r\nbrought into great difficulties, that together with the King’s loose\r\nway of living, having at that time taken the third sister for his\r\nmistress, had certainly broke his heart, for he had been observed from\r\nthat moment to decline, and dyed soon after.[130]\r\n\r\nHaving spent some days at Paris in hearing such like storys, I went\r\nagain to Versailes where we were still put off till the night I left\r\nit. When we had an audience of Mr. Amalot I told him that the Gentlemen\r\nin the Concert in Scotland,[131] having from time to time received\r\nassurances from the late Cardinal of Troops, Arms and Money, had been\r\ncontinualy expecting to hear that a final Resolution was taken but upon\r\nbeing informed of the bad state of health the Cardinal was in,[132]\r\nthey had done me the honour to send me over instructed to represent\r\nthe situation of their affairs to the Ministry and to acquaint them\r\nthey had wrought so effectualy with the Country in general and their\r\nVassals in particular that they could raise near thirty thousand men\r\nand were able to make themselves masters of the Country in six weeks\r\nor two months. Upon which he interrupted me and said that they were\r\nsatisfied the Scots were able to do a great deal but that they must\r\nhave assurances from England, but at the same time he said he did not\r\nwell understand the possibility of engaging so many people without\r\nletting them into the secret. Upon which Lord Semple explained the\r\nmatter to him, I then mentioned to him the number of men, arms, etc.,\r\nwe expected in Scotland together with the place of their landing and\r\nmethod proposed for their acting he said if things were gone into there\r\nwould be no difficulty of arms, money, etc., but seemed to be ignorant\r\nas to the place of landing or indeed the particulars of the scheme and\r\nwhich confirmed me in this; some things that L[ord] Semple mentioned to\r\nhim he knew nothing about and he owned he had not read the memorials\r\nbut promised to do it and gave us to understand that nothing could be\r\nundertaken without encouragement from the English and assurances of the\r\ntroops upon their landing having provisions of victuals and carriages\r\nwhich we took pains to show him that from the frequency of the touns\r\nupon the coast and the trade there continually carried on they could\r\nnot fail of, and then told me he had not gott time to talk seriously\r\nand fully with the King, but that his Majesty desired him to assure me\r\nhe had the King my master’s interest very much at heart and so soon as\r\nhe could do it safely and with his Honour, he would; and told us to\r\nbelieve it that he could easily loss 10,000 men, but that he would not\r\nundertake it rashly as his being foiled in a thing of this kind would\r\nnot be consistant with the Honour of his Crown and desired we might\r\nthink very seriously of what we was about and take care not to bring\r\nruin upon ourselves and the Country by a rash attempt,[133] and so we\r\nparted and so we came that same night to Paris.\r\n\r\nNext day I again wrote to the King a few lines wherein I told him I\r\nthought Mr. Amalot had done as much as he could at the present juncture\r\nand that I thought the information I had gott was well worth my while\r\nof coming over and sure enough it merited the journey, for by this\r\nI had it in my power to assure our friends in Scotland there was no\r\ndeterminate Resolution taken; and at the same time the manner in which\r\nMr. Drummond told me he had taken to engage the Highland Gentlemen\r\nseemed to me very good and practicable. As I was then but little\r\nacquainted with business imagined it might have the same effect upon\r\nthese in the Low Country and indeed was so much prevented with the good\r\ncharacter of L[ord] Semple and Mr. Drummond had amongst those concerned\r\nin his Majesty’s affairs in Scotland that it never came into my head\r\nto doubt of anything they advanced; in which opinion I partly remained\r\ntill my L[ord] T[ra]q[uai]r’s return to Scotland in Octr. 1743 that\r\nsame year.[134]\r\n\r\nFrom what Mr. Amelot had told us the next thing to be done was\r\nendeavouring to form a Concert in England, by which they might be\r\nable to give such encouragement to the French and such assurance of\r\njoining upon their landing together with victuals and carriages as\r\nmight then oblidge the King to declare one way or other. To execute\r\nthis Mr. Drummond and I sett out from Paris the end of Febuary and\r\ngott to London by the way of Dover in four days and a half. The method\r\nhe proposed was to bring my L[ord] T[ra]q[uai]r to London and to work\r\nthe point by him as he was acquainted with all the principal Torries\r\nand desired I would go to York and gett the D[uke] of P[erth] to send\r\nexpress for him and that I would return with a Resolution to stay\r\nthere for some time to be an assistant to his L[ordship] and him; but\r\nthis I refused to go into as the reason I had given out for my journey\r\nwould not suffice to detain me any time, so rather chuse to go to\r\nScotland myself and shew my L[ord] T[ra]q[uai]r the necessity there\r\nwas for his coming up. In the meanwhile I was employed in endeavouring\r\nto learn from Coll. Cicel and Mr. Smith the objections the Dutches\r\nof Buckingham and her party had to L[ord] Semple, and as I was pretty\r\nwell acquainted with them both I easily made myself master of all they\r\nhad to say against him, which I then thought quite frivolous from\r\nthe favourable notion I had of L[ord] Semple. As to the particular\r\naccusations laid against him I shall say nothing of them here as I\r\nshall put down the Copy of a letter I had the Honour to write to the\r\nKing some litle time after my arrival in Scotland wherein I mentioned\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\nI sett out from London[135] the 18th of March, came in by York, where\r\nI saw the D[uke] of P[erth] who was much disappointed upon what I\r\ntold him, stayed 24 hours there and came to Edinburgh the 21st. I\r\nimmediately inquired for L[ord] T[ra]q[uai]r and finding he was in\r\nPerthshire with his brother-in-law L[ord] J[ohn] D[rummon]d I sent an\r\nExpress to him, in the meantime I mett with L[ochie]l and acquainted\r\nhim of all that had passed and particularly of the Scheme he proposed\r\nto raise money whereby to pay his father-in-law’s pension; he was far\r\nfrom being pleased with the French delays and not satisfied with the\r\nCardinal’s sincerity and likewise heartyly vexed there was no money for\r\nSir J[ames] who then stood in great need of it. However the only thing\r\nto be done was for L[ord] T[ra]q[uai]r to go to London and endeavour to\r\nbring in the English which would in a little time satisfie us whether\r\nthe French really intended us their assistance or not. On the 16th of\r\nthe month L[ord] T[ra]q[uai]r came to toun, to whom I told all that\r\nhad passed and his Lordship agreed to go to London. Upon conversing\r\nwith his Lordship[136] I told him that he ought to push Mr. Drummond’s\r\ngetting that money, for if he did not make his word good in that trifle\r\nit would be a means to make folk doubt all the other things he had\r\nadvanced. His Lordship sett out from his own house on the Sixth of\r\nAprile and I sent the bond Mr. Drummond desired signed by L[ochie]l\r\nand I to the D[uke] of Perth who signed it likewise and sent it to\r\nL[ord] T[ra]q[uai]r[137] at London, which is still in Mr. D[rummon]d’s\r\nCustody, but no money raised during my being at London after my return\r\nfrom Paris, Mr. C. Smith delivered me a packet from Rome, but as its\r\ncontents could not be obeyed till I came home, thought it more proper\r\nto insert it here tho’ posterior to the Receit of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopy of a letter from Mr. Edgar of ... mber the 22nd, 1742.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edgar to Murray]\r\n\r\n    SIR,--Upon what Mr. Charles Smith has told me from you on the\r\n    subject of the Bishops[138] upon what he says himself and as the\r\n    opinion also of other friends the King has thought seriously\r\n    on the matter and is pleased to settle it as you proposed, as\r\n    you will see by the enclosed paper signed by him under another\r\n    name and a letter from me to Bishop Ratrae;[139] yours covering\r\n    it both are write in closs Cypher, but as I am unwilling that\r\n    the Cyphers we use together should be put into any third hand\r\n    whatsoever, I have wrote the enclosed packet by the Cypher Coll.\r\n    Urquhart[140] informed me he had recovered from amongst the late\r\n    Earl of Dundonald[141] papers before his death. I really look\r\n    upon this Cypher to be a safe one and that there is no Copy of\r\n    it but what you and I have, it was originally sent to Mr. Robert\r\n    Freebairn[142] and he gave to the Earl of Dundonald and I am\r\n    perswaded neither the one nor t’other made a Copy of it which\r\n    would not be an easie task nor allowed any to be made by any\r\n    other body, I remmember Coll. Urquhart after he had recovered\r\n    that Cypher asked me if he should send it to me, or what he\r\n    should do with it, and in return I desired him to keep it by him\r\n    and give to the King’s friends who had a mind to write to his\r\n    Majesty and wanted a Cypher to do it by, by which means the new\r\n    one I sent him (now used by you and me) would be a Virgin One\r\n    unseen and untouched by anybody, I thought it was necessary\r\n    to say thus much to you on the Cypher in Question. The Packet\r\n    I now send you is open, therefore may if you please look into\r\n    it yourself, but as I reckon you wont care to be at the trouble\r\n    to decypher it I wish you would seal the packet and deliver it\r\n    with ... of the Cypher into Mr. Rattrae’s own hands. I shall\r\n    only add on this subject that I know I need not recommend to you\r\n    to take care of your own safety in this matter and that as few\r\n    as possible and these only of whom you are sure know anything\r\n    that we have the least dealing in it, for tho’ our Clergy be\r\n    well meaning honest men, yett many of them have not the gift\r\n    of Secrecy and holding their tongue, which is a mischief I am\r\n    sure you will guard against. I don’t know indeed what to say to\r\n    you on certain affairs, I live in good hopes they will still go\r\n    well, when anything favourable is certain you will hear of it\r\n    much sooner from Bahady and L[ord] Semple than you could from me;\r\n    which is the reason I write so seldome to you, I am unwilling to\r\n    venture a letter in this critical juncture unless when necessary\r\n    as it happens in the present case. I should be glad you informed\r\n    me of what you heard or know of Drumelzier’s[143] brother he has\r\n    not write to me since he mett with his brother and I have heard\r\n    nothing about him since he went home. Drumelzier, I fancy, may\r\n    have told him the substance of what you communicated to him of my\r\n    letter to you concerning him, which he may have taken very ill\r\n    of me and which has made him write no more to anybody in this\r\n    place. The family is well and the King charges me with many kind\r\n    compliments to you. Longing to have you in my Arms. I am well all\r\n    with my heart.--Sir, etc.\r\n\r\nIt was not long after his Lordship’s departure that I had an occasion\r\nto send a letter to Rome when I wrote as below.[144]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Narsom’s letter to Mr. Edgar dated the       Day of       1743.[145]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murray to Edgar]\r\n\r\n    This is the first opportunity I had to write since I left Paris\r\n    otherwise you may beleive I would not have failed to lett you\r\n    hear from me long e’er now. I received yours of the 22nd of\r\n    Novr. from Mr. Smith at London but as Mr. Rattrae has not been\r\n    in town not finding any sure hand the two enclosed papers are\r\n    still in my Custody, but I am informed he intends soon in this\r\n    place, when I shall take care to deliver them with the Cypher; I\r\n    am very hopefull his Majesty’s making choise of him will prove\r\n    a means of uniting them together as they have for some time ago\r\n    addressed him as the eldest of the Colledge to take inspection\r\n    of the Diocess during the Vacancy; I return you my most sincere\r\n    acknowledgements for your good advice as to my Behaviour with\r\n    them which you may depend upon I’ll strickly follow and by what\r\n    I wrote you of Mr. Keith’s[146] procedure you will be still more\r\n    convinced of the Necessity I am under to act cautiously with\r\n    them. I understand my Lady Clanronald lately received a letter\r\n    from L[ord] J[ohn] D[rummon]d with the contents of your last\r\n    to me which was immediately told Keith so that Mr. Rattrae’s\r\n    Election was known before my Arrival here. I am sorry L[ord]\r\n    T[ra]q[uai]r should keep such correspondence but there are some\r\n    people continue long young and consequently ought to be looked\r\n    upon as Children.\r\n\r\n    Upon my return to London having the fortune to be entirely\r\n    trusted by Coll. Cicel and Mr. Smith, I made it my business to\r\n    inform myself as particularly as possible of their grounds of\r\n    Quarrel with L[ord] Semple, when I found they both agreed in the\r\n    following Accusations, 1mo. That he had been employed by means\r\n    of the Dutchess of Buccingham and Coll. Cicel to transack some\r\n    little affairs and from that time had assumed to himself the\r\n    Character of Minister for the King’s friends in England. 2d. That\r\n    by his Behaviour to Or[mon]d and L[ord] Marshall he had entirely\r\n    disobliged them whose friendship he ought by any means to have\r\n    Cultivate. 3tio. He had been grossly deceived by the Cardinal\r\n    who had made him believe twenty things he had no intention of\r\n    Performing. 4to. He was so credulous in beleiving the Cardinal’s\r\n    assertions as to write from time to time in terms only fitt\r\n    some weeks before an invasion. 5to. He seemed to ack the part\r\n    rather of a French than Brittish minister. 6to. He seemed to\r\n    turn his politicks into a kind of Mechanicks and made a trade\r\n    of them. 7to. He contradicted himself not only in a different\r\n    but even in the same letter, by saying that the Cardinal was\r\n    so well satisfied with the offers made him and the information\r\n    he had gott that he desired no further and in the same letter\r\n    advises Coll. Cicel still to inform him further so that he might\r\n    determine the Cardinal more and more to act in his Majesty’s\r\n    favours. 8to. He acted imprudently by transmitting to Coll. Cicel\r\n    the Commissions sent him by the King to dispose of in so large\r\n    a Packet that Mr. Smith could not conceal them in the Ship and\r\n    at the same time wrote a long letter with a great many trifles\r\n    of what had passed betwixt him and the Cardinal in Closs Cypher\r\n    who, he insinuate, he entirely managed and all relating to the\r\n    Commissions in plain English. 9to. His coming over was not only\r\n    without the knowledge of but disagreeable to the King’s friends\r\n    in England, that my L[ord] Barramore[147] and he were vastly\r\n    uneasy about it and gave him all the Civil usage and fair Words\r\n    they could in Prudence so as to make him leave the place least\r\n    he should be taken up. 10to. He is not trusted by the King’s\r\n    friends in England. 11to. He was not even trusted by the Cardinal\r\n    notwithstanding he pretended he had so much to say with him and\r\n    given this instance that he, the Cardinal, sent a proposal to the\r\n    King’s friends by Mr. Bussie[148] at London of landing a body\r\n    of Swedes[149] in the Country which he seemed greatly surprised\r\n    at when told by L[ord] Barrimore and that he should afterwards\r\n    have greatly repented telling him, imagining when he went over\r\n    he would make a handle of this information to show how he was\r\n    trusted by the English. 12to. That Coll. Cicel told him at\r\n    parting that provided the Cardinal was explicite he would inform\r\n    him of everything that was necessary but as he saw that was not\r\n    like to be the case he never had wrote him anything which was\r\n    sufficient to show him he was not trusted and that he and L[ord]\r\n    Barrimore particularly complained of L[ord] Semple’s intruding\r\n    himself into the management of their affairs, and Lastly that he\r\n    was quite drunk with his ministerial office and acted so high\r\n    and mightily a part as even to intermiddle betwixt the King and\r\n    Dutchess of Buckingham. These so far as I can remember are the\r\n    sum of their Accusations, which I could have reduced into the\r\n    compass of a few lines were it not I thought it my duty to write\r\n    in as plain and minute a manner as possible whatever I have\r\n    learnt having an Eye to nothing but truth and to give the King\r\n    all the information in my power so that if I have acted out of\r\n    my sphere I hope you will interceed for my forgiveness. I only\r\n    beg leave to say that from the little knowledge I have of L[ord]\r\n    Semple I take him to be a man of great honour and possessed of\r\n    much greater abilities than any of his Accusors.[150]\r\n\r\n    I parted with L[ord] T[ra]q[uai]r about a fortnight ago when he\r\n    sett out for London with a view to bring the English to Concert\r\n    matters so as to be able to act this summer. The Gentlemen of\r\n    the Concert are highly dissatisfied with their behaviour they\r\n    say they have been ready to act for some years past, putt to a\r\n    great expense in Cultivating a friendship and intimacy with their\r\n    Vassals, keeping a great many otherwise useless fellows in their\r\n    Grounds and often obliged to give very advantagious [terms] to\r\n    their tennants for fear of disobliging them, whereas on the other\r\n    hand they, the English, do nothing but make a noise and complain\r\n    of their Oppression.\r\n\r\n    The situation of things are such at present that had they any\r\n    Resolution att all they would almost without stroke of sword\r\n    putt an end to the cause but in place of that they draw a cross\r\n    one another and run into little political partys so that if\r\n    they are not brought to engage heartyly so as to be able to\r\n    act this summer we give up all hopes of ever bringing them to\r\n    act in Concert with us. Had the King’s friends in a body used\r\n    means to favour the Restoration they could not have done it to\r\n    better purpose than the present Government. There are now 16,000\r\n    men out of the Country, 6 Regiments more partly gone, the rest\r\n    going, only about twenty thousand in England[151] nine parts\r\n    of ten of which are as raw and undisciplined as those to come\r\n    against them, The Duke of Hannover[152] going over and in short\r\n    every soul--Whigg and Torry, Republican, etc.,--disobliged and\r\n    irritated to the last degree, so that we to be sure are able to\r\n    do more of ourselves at this juncture then we could do with the\r\n    assistance of 10000 men were these Troops returned.\r\n\r\n    L[ochie]l with whom I have Occasion often to talk on this subject\r\n    gives it as his Opinion that the Highlanders have now for so\r\n    long time been in hopes of something being done and now seeing\r\n    so fair an Opportunity, will probably unless brought into Action\r\n    once this Summer or harvest give up all thought of ever seeing\r\n    a Restoration and he is afraid every one will do the best they\r\n    can by endeavouring to catch at part of his Country before she\r\n    sink entirely and I am really affraid it will be the case with\r\n    some of the least steady amongst them. He is thoroughly convinced\r\n    that with 20,000 Stand of arms his Majesty or the Prince with a\r\n    good General and some Officers att our head, Scotland is well\r\n    able to do the whole affair, and indeed it is not only his, but\r\n    the opinion of several others I talk to in this place upon that\r\n    subject, as in this case none would be exempt from carrying arms\r\n    and things are now quite changed from what they were formerly\r\n    when a simelar proposal[153] was made. This I could not fail\r\n    acquainting you with least L[ord] T[ra]q[uai]r’s journey don’t\r\n    take effect and this irrecoverable opportunity lost by the\r\n    further delay of the English, and indeed any delay may prove of\r\n    the worst consequence as the death of either L[ord] L[ova]t or\r\n    Sir J[ames] C[ampbell] who are both old men will greatly weaken\r\n    if not entirely ruin the Concert as there are few to be found\r\n    who can fill their places. L[ochie]l desires me to mention the\r\n    great use General Keith would be off. The Highlanders having\r\n    got the same notion of him they formerly had of Lord Dundee.\r\n    Drumelzier and his Brother have been all this winter at Tangiers\r\n    and propose to pass all the Watters where General Keith and Lord\r\n    Crawford[154] were tho’ some people imagine D[rumelzier] will\r\n    come home upon account of his Lady’s death,[155] they give it out\r\n    here that Mr. Hay is very well. I wrote a letter two weeks ago to\r\n    L[ord] Marshall a Copy of which with the Motives that induced me\r\n    to write you shall have first occasion but the bearer being ready\r\n    to sett out putts a stop to my doing of it at present.--I am,\r\n    Yours, etc.\r\n\r\nThe ship not sailing as soon as I was made believe I took the\r\nopportunity of writing Mr. Edgar the reason of my writting to L[ord]\r\nMarshall I shall here subjoin with a Copy of the Letter I wrote his\r\nLordship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murray to Edgar]\r\n\r\n    SIR,--When Mr. Smith and I happened to be frequently together at\r\n    London he took reason to complain of the letter my L[ord] Semple\r\n    had wrote to L[ord] Marshall and particularly of that paragraph\r\n    where my L[ord] hints that possibly the Scots folks were offended\r\n    with my L[ord] Marshall not taking sufficient notice of them in\r\n    proportion to the regard they had shown him he insisted greatly\r\n    an invincible attachment his Lordship had for the King....\r\n\r\n    _The rest of this page not legible._\r\n\r\n    Upon this I thought I should be greatly to blame if I lost\r\n    any opportunity that occurred to better his Majesty’s affairs\r\n    by endeavouring to reconceal and unite his friends so that as\r\n    I imagine his Lordship authorised Mr. Smith to talk upon a\r\n    suspicion that there might be some grounds for what L[ord] Semple\r\n    advanced and thereby to reconceal himself to his countrymen I\r\n    was resolved as we say to putt a Thorne in his foot as he knows\r\n    I am instituted by the King’s friends here and would not advance\r\n    anything contrary to their Sentiments. You will be surprised I\r\n    should write this to you in so closs a Cypher....\r\n\r\n    _The rest of this page not legible._\r\n\r\n    After reflecting upon what you had been so good as to inform me\r\n    off I could not fail to write the enclosed as I have all the\r\n    reason in the World to believe you my friend, so I take the\r\n    liberty to beg that after perusal in case you find it not too\r\n    assuming and in a stile sufficiently respectly you will be so\r\n    good as take the trouble to deliver it with an appology....

BROUN.[156]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murray to Earl Marischal[157]]\r\n\r\n    MY LORD,--I heartyly regreted it was not in my power when so near\r\n    as London to do myself the honour of waiting upon your Lordship\r\n    for Reasons I beg Mr. Smith to give and at the same time assure\r\n    your Lordship that without the honour of being known to you\r\n    there was none who had a more hearty and sincere Regard for your\r\n    Lordship’s property.... [_Not legible._] my Lord, abstracting\r\n    from your many private Virtues makes you dear to every true\r\n    Scotsman and from what I could easily learn gives your Lordship\r\n    great weight with the English. This, my Lord, encourages me to\r\n    suggest of what use you may be att this juncture to his Majesty’s\r\n    affairs by uniting those people together who to my great concern\r\n    I found (so far as I could judge) quite inactive, diffident\r\n    of one another and distrustfull of those they employ. Your\r\n    Lordship’s being so near them will I hope make the work short\r\n    as well as Effectual, and in my poor Judgement were there any\r\n    unanimity, any harmony and concord amongst them it would easily\r\n    be in our power to shake off the yoke of Bondage and Slavery we\r\n    now groan under; this, my Lord, I propose with great submission\r\n    to your Lordship’s serious reflection and experience, I shall\r\n    only add that as I have no other in any thing I do but to promote\r\n    the real Interest of my King and Country so I have all the reason\r\n    in the world to believe that healing the wounds and cementing the\r\n    differences now subsisting amongst our Neighbours is the greatest\r\n    ambition of our countrymen and must render their gratitude to\r\n    your Lordship for so great a work unalterable. I begg your\r\n    Lordship will pardon my presumption in writing without being\r\n    asked and believe I am with the most sincere regard and esteem,\r\n    My Lord, etc.[158]\r\n\r\nThese two preceding letters I gave to my L[ord] T[ra]q[uai]r on the 5th\r\nof Aprile 1743, the day before his Lordship sett out from his own house\r\nto London which he was to show Mr. McGregar who told my Lord that this\r\nwas not a time to send such letters and besides that the letter to Lord\r\nMarshall was not such an one he proposed, by which means they never\r\nwent. I shall here mention what occurred to me what was the reason for\r\nMr. McGregars stoping them never having any further reason given than\r\nthe above and not knowing even that till L[ord T]raq[uai]r’s return\r\nto Scotland, during the short stay I made att London after my return\r\nfrom Paris in company with Mr. McGregar as I said before I made it my\r\nbusiness to learn of Coll. Cicel and Mr. Smith all the Complaints they\r\nhad against Lord Semple and Mr. McGregar which I generally communicated\r\nto him being then fully perswaded of their Honesty and Abilitys. Upon\r\ntelling him what Mr. Smith had said in relation to Lord Marshall he\r\npurposed I should write to his Lordship a Letter in the same Stile\r\nLord Semple had done, purposely to let him know how little he was in\r\nfavour with his Countrymen and show him how much their liking depended\r\nupon his being well with them two, and att the same time to acquaint\r\nhim that his Countrymen’s regard went no further than so far as he\r\nshould act entirely conformable to the King’s will, he saying that\r\nLord Marshall pretended to stand entirely upon his own legs from the\r\ngreat Number of Admirers he had in Scotland, and imagined that unless\r\nhe was the sole manager of the King’s affairs his Majesty’s subjects\r\nwould not be brought to act for him, in short that he looked upon\r\nthe King’s interest to depend upon [him] alone. I suppose he thought\r\nby my writing in this stile to draw something from Lord Marshall\r\nundervalueing of his Countrymen whereby to hurt him with the generality\r\nbut particularly with those of the Concert who had first employed and\r\nstill supported him, whereby he might verify to them what he had so\r\nlong advance against his Lordship, but this was a thing I refused for\r\nmany reasons; first that it must hurt the King’s affairs to create\r\ndifferences amongst his friends of which their then subsisted too many;\r\nsecondly it was running myself headlong into a party quarrel, a thing\r\nI ever had the worst oppinion off; and thirdly, not to be too tedious\r\nin giving many more, it was a thing I had not the smallest tittle to\r\ndo. But on the contrary I thought it was a fair opportunity of uniting\r\npeople together and commencing a Correspondence with Lord Marshall\r\nwhereby if I gain his friendship and confidence I [should] thereby be\r\nenabled to inform the King of the pleas of both partys without letting\r\neither of them know of it, which is acting a part some people may think\r\nodd as it is seemingly playing with both hands, but in my Eyes not\r\nonly honourable but my duty, when for the King’s interest, I receive\r\nfrom time to time letters from L[ord] T[ra]q[uai]r when att London\r\ninforming me in his way of his success with the English; but as there\r\nwas nothing material in them and that they were signed by himself I did\r\nnot care to keep them in case of accidents. Some time in the month of\r\nJune I received the following letter from Mr. Edgar with two enclosed\r\nfrom the King himself in answer to two I had wrote when at Paris.\r\n\r\nCopy Mr. Edgar’s letter, dated March 14th, 1743.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edgar to Murray]\r\n\r\n    SIR,--You will see by the enclosed I send you from our friend\r\n    Mr. Edwards (he means the King) that he leaves me nothing to say\r\n    in return to your two letters of the 18th and 25th of february.\r\n    This Packet is sent open to Lord Semple to forward to you, you\r\n    will see it is write in his Cypher, a Copy of which I know Mr.\r\n    McGregor left with L[ord] T[ra]q[uai]r so I reckon you may easily\r\n    gett this read, for suppose you may have that Cypher in your own\r\n    Custody. You will be glad to know that the family is well, I\r\n    heartyly wish you all health and happiness and longing to have\r\n    the pleasure of Embracing you, I am with great Esteem, etc.\r\n\r\nLetter from the Chevalier to John Murray.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Chevalier de St. George to Murray]\r\n\r\n    I received a few days ago yours of the 18th of February and am\r\n    far from disaproving your comming into France att this Time.[159]\r\n    The Settling of a Correspondence betwixt us on this Side of\r\n    the Sea and our friends in Scotland may be of consequence in\r\n    this juncture I hope you will have concerted some safe method\r\n    for this effect with Lord Semple before you leave him and\r\n    that once determined you will I think have done very well to\r\n    return home where you may be of more use than abroad. I shall\r\n    say nothing here of what’s passing in France of which you will\r\n    have been informed by Lord Semple, and you may be well assured\r\n    that depends upon me to induce the French to assist us as is\r\n    reasonable to hope they will if their be a general war. But if\r\n    they ever undertake anything in my favour, I shall to be sure\r\n    have little warning of it before and by consequence I fear it\r\n    will be impossible that General Keith can come in time into\r\n    Scotland how much soever both I, and I am perswaded himself also,\r\n    desires it because you will easily see that one of his rank\r\n    and distinction cannot well quite the Service he is in either\r\n    abruptly or upon an uncertainty. I remark all you say to me on\r\n    that subject and when the time comes it shall be my care to\r\n    dispose all such matters in as much as in me lys for what I may\r\n    then think for the real good of my Service and for my friends\r\n    Satisfaction also for in such sort of particulars it is scarce\r\n    possible to take proper Resolutions before the time of Execution.\r\n    I had some time ago a proposal made me in Relation to the Seizing\r\n    of Stirling Castle[160] what I then heard and what you now say\r\n    on that subject is so general, that I think it is not impossible\r\n    but that the two proposals may be found originally one and the\r\n    same project; I wish therefore you would enter a little more\r\n    into particulars that I may be the better able to determine what\r\n    directions to send. As to what is represented about the Vassals\r\n    I suppose what you mean is the same with what I have inserted\r\n    in a draught of a Declaration for Scotland I have long had by\r\n    me, viz., That the Vassals of those who should appear against my\r\n    forces on a landing should be freed of their Vassalidge and hold\r\n    immediately of the Crown provided such Vassals should declare for\r\n    me and join heartyly in my Cause. As this is my intention I allow\r\n    my friends to make such prudent use of it as they may think\r\n    fitt. Before you gett this you will probably have received what\r\n    was wrote to you from hence about the Scotts Episcopal Clergy\r\n    so that I need say nothing on that subject here more than that\r\n    I hope the steps taken by me will give satisfaction and promote\r\n    union in that Body.\r\n\r\n    It is a great comfort to me to see the Gentlemen of the Concert\r\n    so zealous so united and so frank in all that relates to my\r\n    service and I desire you will say all that is kind to them in\r\n    my name, I remark you have advanced one hundred pounds of your\r\n    own money[161] for Sir J[ames] C[ampbe]ll which I take very well\r\n    of you but I desire you would not give me any more proofs of\r\n    that kind of your goodwill towards me and as for what is past I\r\n    look upon it as a personal Debt and shall take care that it be\r\n    repayed, I remark what you say about the difficulty their is of\r\n    raising money I foresaw that would be no easy matter and think it\r\n    should not be insisted upon, I think I have now taken notice of\r\n    all that required any answer in what you wrote to me and Edgar\r\n    and shall add nothing further here but to assure you of the\r\n    continuance of any good opinion of you and that your prudent and\r\n    zealous indeavours toward my service shall never be forgott by me.\r\n\r\n    (_Signed_) J. EDWARDS.[162]\r\n\r\n    Dated _March 11th, 1743_.\r\n\r\nAt the same time came the following:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Chevalier to Murray]\r\n\r\n    Since I wrote to you on 11th I have seen what you wrote to Edgar\r\n    of the same date; I remark what you say on extending a Concert\r\n    in the Low Country and the Method[163] it has been done in the\r\n    Highlands such a measure may be a great advantage to the cause\r\n    and therefore I cannot but much approve of it, provided it be\r\n    gone about with great prudence and Caution, which I earnestly\r\n    recommend to you not only on your own account but mine also, for\r\n    we must in this juncture carefully avoid anything that may give\r\n    the Government any jealousie or pretence to molest our friends. I\r\n    am well pleased to observe what you say of L[ochie]l and if you\r\n    have occasion make him a kind Compliment from me and the Prince,\r\n    this is all I have to add or present in this paper.\r\n\r\n    Signed as befor and dated 14th, 1743.\r\n\r\nIn the first letter I wrote to Mr. Edgar after my return home I told\r\nhim that the Packet for Bishop Rattrae was still in my Custody being\r\ninformed that he intended to be soon in town so thought it fitt to\r\ndelay doing any thing in it till he should come, accordingly whenever\r\nI heard of his arrival I went immediately to the Country where the\r\nCypher Mr. Edgar mentioned there was, and brought it to town with\r\nme but to my Surprise found it did not answer. Yett I nevertheless\r\nresolved to deliver the Packet to him att the same time reading the\r\nparagraph in mine concerning it so sent for Mr. Rae[164] one of the\r\nPresbyters in Edinburgh and told him I wished to see Mr. Rattrae and\r\ndesired he would go to him and acquaint him with my intention and make\r\nan appointment for me which he agreed to do next mourning. He came to\r\nme on the morrow and told me had missed him but would indeavour to find\r\nhim sometime that day upon which he left me and found him dinning with\r\nhis daughter Mrs. ---- so delayed it till next morning, but when he\r\nwent was informed by his daughter Mrs. Clark in whose house he lived\r\nthat he had been taken ill the night before of an Epidimical Distemper\r\nthat at that time raged almost all of over Europe of which he died in\r\nthree or four days illness, by which means that Packet still remains in\r\nmy Custody, never since having gott any directions about it. From that\r\ntime I have keept my Resolution of never having any more to do with\r\nthe Clergy, for when I was asked some few days after by Mr. Rae what I\r\nthought they should do in their present situation, I told him I thought\r\nthey should draw up a full and distinct state of their [affairs]\r\nwithout neglecting the least thing and send it to the King leaving him\r\nto determine without any further representations, but shunned writting\r\nor taking any Commissions about it, nor do I since know any of their\r\nprocedure none of them having ever spoke to me on the subject.\r\n\r\nAbout this Time the Duke of P[erth] came from England and as L[ochie]l\r\nand [I] had often Schemed together what we ourselves were able to\r\ndo in the present posture of affairs and seemed to agree in Opinion\r\nthat should the french disapoint us we were more able to restore the\r\nKing by our own strength during the absence of the Army than with the\r\nAssistance of 10,000 men were our Troops once returned, for which\r\nreason did the English fail to give the assurances to the french they\r\nrequired, but we should gett the people at home to take it in hand\r\nby themselves. With this View I had already wrote Mr. Edgar on that\r\nStrain and now we agreed to sound the Duke of P[erth] on the same\r\nSubject which we did and found him abundantly forward. He was then\r\ngoing to the Country and Sir A[lexander] Mc[Donal]d[165] was with his\r\nbrother-in-law A[irl]y so desired the Duke would try him and some days\r\nafter had a letter from hime wherein he said that he had spoke to him\r\nas was agreed and found him very keen that he said the sooner it was\r\ndone the better and in place of 700 men which his Uncle carried with\r\nhim in the year 1715 he would now bring 1200. At the same time when his\r\nGrace was talking to us in Edinburgh on this subject he said the people\r\nin that part of the Country where he had come from very honest and\r\nthat the Mayer and Aldermen had spoke to him in the strongest terms,\r\nwhich he then told us, and desired I might acquaint the King of it, so\r\nI desired his Grace would putt it in writting and that I should not\r\nfail to transmit it to his Majesty; upon which he went to another room\r\nand brought me a sheet of paper mostly write which I did not care to\r\ntransmitt in his own words but abridged it; however shall say no more\r\nof it here as I will putt down the letter I wrote the King and another\r\nto Mr. Edgar. I must only observe that I read the Duke’s memorial to my\r\nL[ord] T[ra]q[uai]r att his own house upon giving him some paper he had\r\nputt in my custody att his leaving Scotland, at which time his Lordship\r\nand I agreed to put it in the fire as the letter I had wrote and which\r\nI att the same time read to my Lord contained the substance of it, this\r\nI have frequently repented since, as his Grace’s memory did not seem to\r\nserve him exactly to what he had wrote. In answer to his Majesty’s I\r\nwrote the following, Dated July 5th, 1743:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murray to the Chevalier]\r\n\r\n    SIR,--I had the honour of your Majesty’s commands some weeks\r\n    ago of the 11th of March. I communicated the paragraph of your\r\n    Majesty’s relating to the certainty of General Keith’s coming to\r\n    Scotland to the Duke of P[erth] and L[ochie]l who are equally\r\n    well satisfied with what your Majesty is pleased to say on that\r\n    subject. Your Majesty’s Declaration with regard to the Scotts\r\n    Vassals and the Liberty you are most graciously pleased to grant\r\n    of insinuating so much to them give L[ochie]l extream pleasure\r\n    being convinced it will tend greatly to promote your Majesty’s\r\n    interest. The Duke of P[erth] desired me to acquaint your Majesty\r\n    that the Mayer and Aldermen of York had freely opened their\r\n    minds to him on the Subject of the Restoration and gave him a\r\n    Commission humble to Represent their Loyalty and firm attachment\r\n    to your Majesty’s cause. They engage that upon hearing of your\r\n    Majesty’s aproach with a Sufficient Body to support them they\r\n    will raise 10,000 men in that County and have no doubt of an\r\n    equal Number from the Countys Adjacent. There are two gentlemen\r\n    one of them a present member the other was last parliament but\r\n    declined it these have the Sole management of the County and\r\n    did they appear would certainly be followed by every one in it.\r\n    His Grace had not the good fortune to see them they being at\r\n    London but left them his Compliments by some of their friends\r\n    who assured him they were ready upon your Majesty’s desire to\r\n    enter into any Scheme to promote your Majesty’s interest. His\r\n    Grace desired me likewise to inform your Majesty that he is fully\r\n    convinced and may almost affirm that upon shewing an order from\r\n    your Majesty to treat with them they will sign any declaration\r\n    or assurance of whatever Nature shall be thought most for your\r\n    Majesty’s interest and to have the Mayer and Aldermen, at least\r\n    those of them upon whose Secrecy they can the most depend to\r\n    do the like. In the Duke’s Memorandum to me he neglected the\r\n    two Gentlemen’s names. As the Election of their Mayer goes\r\n    by Rotation it falls next year upon a Whig which his grace\r\n    thinks can be of no consequence as none of that Kidney have any\r\n    Interest, in the town, but he was told that notwithstanding the\r\n    custom, if your Majesty desired it they would indeavour to have\r\n    another chosen. I shall incroatch no further upon your Majesty’s\r\n    time having wrote to Mr. Edgar but beg leave to subscribe myself\r\n    with the greatest Veneration and Duty your Majesty’s, etc.\r\n\r\nLetter to Mr. Edgar, dated July 5th, 1743.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murray to Edgar]\r\n\r\n    Since I had the pleasure of receiving your last letter the Duke\r\n    of P[erth] returned from York after having gott a very possitive\r\n    and harsh Refusall from the Lady to whom he was making his\r\n    addresses, during his stay there he had some commissions from the\r\n    Mayer and Aldermen to the King with which I had the honour to\r\n    acquaint the King by the enclosed amongst others they begged he\r\n    might offer their humble Duty and assure him of their unalterable\r\n    Regard to his Interest. They intended to send his Highness the\r\n    Duke[166] the freedom of their toun in a Gold Box as the highest\r\n    mark of their regard for his Highness who does them the honour to\r\n    bear the Name of their Town but being afraid least a discovery\r\n    should be made by Workmen or others who would render them the\r\n    less usefull to his Majesty they must humbly beg his Highness\r\n    would look upon the Compliment as real and Honour them with his\r\n    Acceptance.\r\n\r\n    L[ochie]l and I spoke to the Duke upon the supposition we should\r\n    obtain no assistance from France how far he thought it would be\r\n    prudent at this juncture to undertake the King’s Restoration\r\n    ourselves. Upon his Grace’s approving of the scheme, I proposed\r\n    when he went to the Country he should talk to Sir A[lexander]\r\n    M[acdonal]d upon the same, which he accordingly did, and sent an\r\n    answer to L[ochie]l wherin he says that found him entirely of the\r\n    same Opinion, that he seemed to think there was a necessity for\r\n    it, and that it ought to be done as soon as possible and that\r\n    in place of 700 men his Uncle brought with him in the year 1715\r\n    he would engage to bring 1200. I could not fail to acquaint you\r\n    with his Opinion, he being the most reserved cautious man I ever\r\n    knew, and the least apt to say or do anything rashly, everybody\r\n    is of Opinion the Government designs by all methods to Ruin the\r\n    Highlands which to be sure makes the Gentlemen fond to have\r\n    something done before it be out of their power to be of service,\r\n    especially as there are some of them whose Estates are so low\r\n    such as G[lengar]ry C[lanranal]d A[p]p[i]n C[ap]p[oc]h that they\r\n    will be obliged either to sell their lands or conform to the\r\n    Government through necessity; and am very credibly[167] informed\r\n    that Ca[p]p[oc]h was this Winter at London on a Scheme of raising\r\n    an independent Company. Since Mr. Smith came to this place he\r\n    has insisted with Lo[chie]l to go over to see Lord Marshall who\r\n    he tells him has had several different accounts of the State of\r\n    the Highlands so that he is very anxious to talk to him upon\r\n    that head. L[ochie]l excuses himself from going but told me Mr.\r\n    Smith supposed his Lordship was informed of everything by the\r\n    King and that the State given in by Mr. Drummond was just he is\r\n    certain; but now things are much better and that Mr. Drummond\r\n    rather erred in making the number too small[168] being determined\r\n    to advance nothing but what he could answer for. I had a letter\r\n    lately from my L[ord] T[ra]q[uai]r wherein he seems to hint that\r\n    his Majesty’s friends in England are in a way of acting with more\r\n    vigour and unanimity than they have hitherto done. I hope they\r\n    are now become sensible of their weak and groundless prejudices\r\n    against Lord Semple (a Catalogue of which I sent you in my last)\r\n    as well as of the necessity there is to act Vigorously and\r\n    Resolutely for his Majesty’s Restoration. It would seem L[ord]\r\n    T[ra]q[uai]r and Mr. Drummond have not judged it fitt to send\r\n    my letter to L[ord] Marshall (a Copy of which I sent you in my\r\n    last) for I have never had the smallest hint of it from Mr. Smith\r\n    neither has L[ord] T[ra]q[uai]r taken occasion to mention it in\r\n    any of his Letters to me. Upon Bishop Rattrae’s coming to town\r\n    I went immediately to the Country for the Cypher when I found\r\n    it did not in the least correspond to that Coll. Urquhart must\r\n    certainly have been mistaken. I nevertheless resolved to deliver\r\n    the letters att the same time showing him the paragraph in mine\r\n    relative to him and to tell him the cause of the mistake, but\r\n    this day I sent one of his Brethern to acquaint him that I would\r\n    wait on him in the afternoon, he was abroad and the next day\r\n    when I sent again found he was taken ill of a Pluirisy of which\r\n    he died two days after[169] which to be sure is a very great\r\n    misfortune and not the less so that Mr. Keith is now Senior\r\n    Bishop, what they are now doing or intend to do I don’t know I\r\n    have sent you the Cypher inclosed but retained the Letter till\r\n    further Orders.\r\n\r\n    We had great rejoicings some days ago on account of a Battle\r\n    said to be gained by the Allies in Germany,[170] but by latter\r\n    Accounts, the Case seems to have been that the Army of the\r\n    Allies had gott too far into the Country and finding a Scarcity\r\n    of provisions (especially amongst the English) they resolved to\r\n    return from whence they came when they were attacked by a body\r\n    of French to the number of 25,000 or thereabouts, some write\r\n    they intended to attack their rear and harrass them on their\r\n    march, others they proposed intercepting 12,000 Hannoverians\r\n    and Hessians that were on their march to join the Army, but\r\n    whatever was their Intention they attacked our foot. Whereupon a\r\n    very smart engagement ensued, wherein both partys seem to have\r\n    suffered severely. The French repassed the river and we continued\r\n    our march and are now gott near to frankfort where its said the\r\n    Emperor is and talks of a Suspension of Arms I wish too good a\r\n    peace may not ensue. You certainly cant help laughing when you\r\n    consider with what Vigour and Success we carry on our war with\r\n    Spain. Never was a poor Country in so miserable a Condition as\r\n    we are in att present, neither Money nor Trade nor Credit, nay\r\n    nor so much as the smallest degree of honour or Character left\r\n    us. The Duke of P[erth]’s Stay here was so short that I could\r\n    not gett him to explain his Scheme of Seizing Stirlling Castle,\r\n    but I wont neglect the first opportunity to have it from him. I\r\n    am Still obliged to continue the old Cannal of Correspondence\r\n    not being able while att London to find any Safe Conveyance from\r\n    thence, but I hope Lord T[ra]q[uai]r will have effectuated that\r\n    before his return; I have now write everything that occurrs to me\r\n    I wish may not already have tired you.--So with hearty prayers\r\n    for the familys wellfare and all friends with you and that we\r\n    may soon meet on a Solid and happy footing, I beg that you would\r\n    believe that I ever am, etc.\r\n\r\n        Dated _July 5th, 1743_.\r\n\r\n    _P.S._--I had almost neglected to tell you that while I was att\r\n    London I ordered a Countryman of ours to work Six pair of the\r\n    finest Silk-Stockens he could possibly make, which as they are\r\n    home manufactory and finest I believe were mad in the Island I\r\n    have ventured to send them by Mr. Smith to Rome hoping the Prince\r\n    will do his Country and me the honour to accept of them.\r\n\r\nMy Lord T[ra]q[uai]r having now been three months att London and we all\r\nthat time receiving no Material accounts of Success things looked as if\r\nthis Summer would be Spent as well as the former without any Resolution\r\ntaken of coming to Blows in the Autumn or Winter which made all those\r\nof the concert very uneasy but particularly my Lord L[ova]t, so that he\r\nseemed to give up all hopes of the Schemes ever succeeding and wrote\r\nto L[ochie]l several Letters wherein he resolved to settle his affairs\r\nand go to London where, after he had sollicited an appeal he intended\r\nto lodge against Chisholm, he would then go over to France with his\r\nson. L[ochie]l was so good as show me the most of his Letters and from\r\nsome things he said, but particularly a paragraph in one of them we had\r\nreason to conjecture he proposed to end his days in a Religious house;\r\nthis we were the more easily induced to believe as his Lordship had now\r\nlived to a great age during the most of which he had acted a part in\r\nthe world not looked upon by the Generality of Mankind in a favourable\r\nlight. We therefore agreed that L[ochie]l Should write him dissuading\r\nhim from his design but at the same time he seemed so positive that\r\nit was thought Necessary to acquaint the King of it as his Majesty’s\r\norders appeared to us the only mean whereby to prevent his journey,\r\nknowing that his leaving the Country would be of the worst Consequence\r\nas there was not a man in that part of the Country capable to manage\r\nit but himself and in general that his appearing publickly in Arms for\r\nthe King must be of great Service, for which Reasons the first Occasion\r\nthat occurred I wrote to the King dated September 5th 1743:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murray to the Chevalier]\r\n\r\n    SIR,--I had the honour to write to your majesty the 5th of July\r\n    last which I hope is come Safe. I have of late seen several\r\n    Letters from Lord L[ovat] to L[ochie]l wherein he Express great\r\n    Anxiety and impatience that things are not like to come to a\r\n    conclusion. I take it to be upon that account that he has settled\r\n    his affairs att home and is now taking leave of his friends with\r\n    a Resolution of going this Winter to London there to solicite\r\n    an appeal and from thence to France with his Son. Your Majesty\r\n    will see at first View all the inconveniencys that may attend\r\n    such a procedure more readily than I can express, he being the\r\n    only man in the Country capable to manage that part of the\r\n    Country alloted him, and indeed I am afraid from a paragraph in\r\n    one of his Letters that he has some thoughts of Ending his days\r\n    in a monastry Since he thinks he cannot do it in your Majestys\r\n    Service. Affairs abroad seem now to tend more and more to a War\r\n    with france which Should it happen will I hope putt a Stop to his\r\n    journey, but failing that I am apt to believe nothing will do\r\n    save your Majestys orders, etc.\r\n\r\n    To Mr. Edgar.\r\n\r\n    _September 5, 1743._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murray to Edgar]\r\n\r\n    SIR,--I gave you the trouble of a pretty long Letter the fifth\r\n    of July last, since which I have not had the pleasure of hearing\r\n    from you. Lord T[ra]q[uai]r is still att London but proposes to\r\n    be soon down here, which I heartily wish, some folks being vastly\r\n    anxious for his return expecting upon that Event to be intirely\r\n    satisfied as to what may be hoped for from the Kings friends in\r\n    England. Upon the Highland deserters being shott att London,[171]\r\n    which has greatly disobliged their Countrymen, I took it upon\r\n    me to acquaint some of the Gentlemen that it was his Majestys\r\n    pleasure they should endeavour to prevent as much as possible\r\n    any of their followers from inlisting in the Service of the\r\n    present Government. This I thought the more necessary as a great\r\n    many of them have been carried out of the Country for some years\r\n    past, the Dutch having gott several hundreds upon their last\r\n    Augmentation.[172] My Lord K[e]n[mur]e is returned from Portugall\r\n    perfectly recovered. I said some obliging things to him in his\r\n    Majestys Name of gaining the Cameronians (amongst whom he lived)\r\n    to his Majestys Interest. I am very sensible what a fickle Sett\r\n    of people they are and how difficult an undertaking of this kind\r\n    may prove. Yett as Sir Th[oma]s G[ord][o]n of E[arls]t[o]n,[173]\r\n    a leading man amongst them two years ago, spoke to the late Lord\r\n    of the precarious Situation of the present Government, and in\r\n    case of a Restoration begged his protection, this Lord seemed\r\n    the fitter person to learn his present Sentiments. Your Friend\r\n    Sir J[ames] S[tewar]t[174] who deservedly well liked by all his\r\n    acquaintances is to be married to Lord W[emy]ss eldest daughter,\r\n    a Match made by Lord E[lcho][175] who left this the beginning of\r\n    Summer and I understand, is now at Boulogne, so that I had no\r\n    opportunity to deliver the Compliments his Majesty and the Prince\r\n    honour him with. I beg you will believe me, etc.\r\n\r\n    Some time in the month of August the Laird of Mc[Leo]d[176] came\r\n    to Edinburgh and told L[ochie]l on his way here, who desired he\r\n    might see him, and that he had several Commissions to us, so\r\n    desired he would make an appointment with me. When L[ochie]l\r\n    spoke to me of it I agreed to ride out with him on the Saturday\r\n    to Peggie Vints where he proposed to dine and see a son of Lord\r\n    L[ovat]s who was then at the School of Preston,[177] but we were\r\n    both afraid from his saying that he had several Commissions\r\n    that his Lordship had been too open with him, contrary to the\r\n    engagement all these of the Concert had come under to one\r\n    another; for which reason we resolved to be very cautious\r\n    and determined, in case we found it as we suspected, to say\r\n    nothing of it to him. We according mett, dined in the Country\r\n    and adjurned to the Tavern in Edinburgh where we resolved to\r\n    give him leave to say or ask as few questions as possible and\r\n    took occasion to speak a good deal on the present miserable\r\n    Situation of the Country, and tell him that we thought him one\r\n    of the fittest Persons we knew to instigate the English to join\r\n    heartily for promoting the Kings interest, being both a highland\r\n    man and one of power in the Country; and at the same time told\r\n    him it was his Majestys pleasure that the Chiefs of the Clans\r\n    should allow none of their men to leave the Country. To which\r\n    he answered that he and Sir A[lexander] Mc[Donal]d had taken\r\n    care to let none of theirs inlist, and said a good deal of his\r\n    readiness to serve the King so soon as an occasion should offer,\r\n    and that he had already during his being att London made it his\r\n    business to incite and encourage the English to every thing that\r\n    cou’d conduce to his Majestys interest; and as to Lord L[ova]ts\r\n    commissions, they turned out only to inquiring about Lord\r\n    T[ra]q[uai]r and what news or good hopes he had. From this time\r\n    nothing passed worthy the noticeing, I had some compliments from\r\n    Lord L[ova]t in his letters to L[ochie]l wherein he acquainted\r\n    him with the success he had in a Circuit he made over the Country\r\n    and then gott a Letter or two from himself on these subjects and\r\n    desiring his Majesty might be acquainted with it and at the same\r\n    time saying he was resolved to continue at Home in expectation of\r\n    something satisfactory upon my Lord T[ra]q[uai]r’s return. Upon\r\n    this I wrote the following Letter to Mr. Edgar, dated October\r\n    28th, 1743.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murray to Edgar]\r\n\r\n    SIR,[178]--I has the pleasure of writing to you the fifth of\r\n    last moneth with one inclosed to his Majesty, which makes me give\r\n    you the trouble of this to acquaint you that upon L[ochie]ls\r\n    repeated Letters to Lord L[ovat] together with Copys of my Lord\r\n    T[ra]q[uai]rs from London which I sent him, he is determined not\r\n    to stir from home this Winter. I should be greatly to blame did I\r\n    neglect to inform you that his Lordship has been most assiduous\r\n    this Summer to promote his Majestys Interest in his district so\r\n    that I have great reason to believe that he is sure of all those\r\n    he engaged for. He seems to be in great spirits upon account of\r\n    his success in his Circuit he lately made over the Country when\r\n    he gained most of the Monroes,[179] a people as little to have\r\n    been expected as any in the Highlands. He keeps an open table by\r\n    which means he is become very popular, and I believe, generally\r\n    speaking, has more to say than any in that Country. L[ochie]l is\r\n    still here expecting every day Lord T[ra]q[uai]rs arrival etc.\r\n    His Lordship, to the best of my Remmembrance, came to Scotland\r\n    sometime in the moneth when L[ochie]l and I immediately mett with\r\n    him. He acquainted us that Mr. Drummond had left London a great\r\n    while before him and promised so soon as he gott to Paris that\r\n    the King of France and his ministers should be acquainted with\r\n    the favourable accounts he had to give of his Success and that\r\n    he would forthwith inform Lord T[ra]q[uai]r of every Resolution\r\n    that was taken. His Lordship likewise told us what had passed\r\n    during his Stay at London, which I shall not pretend to give\r\n    a particular detail of, having no authority to intermeddle\r\n    with, nor ever had, any particular concern in what regarded the\r\n    English; so shall leave it to his Lordship to give a particular\r\n    account of his Negotiations in that Country, if he shall think it\r\n    necessary. I shall only mention here that his Lordship informed\r\n    us that he had talk’d with the principal people of the Tory\r\n    party some of which were very timerous, others such as Lord\r\n    Bar[rymo]re very ready to join in any thing that could conduce to\r\n    forward the Restoration, and that he had frankly offered, when\r\n    they proposed a sum of Money to be ready to the Value of £12,000\r\n    which was scrupled at by some, to provide it himself. That Lord\r\n    O[rre]ry[180] I had made two several apointments with him and\r\n    Mr. Drummond, neither of which he keept, but Stept out of Town\r\n    without Seeing of them. But I must observe that from all I can\r\n    Remmember of the Story no particular Concert was formed nor was\r\n    their any appearance given the french of meeting with provisions,\r\n    Carriages and horses att their landing, as Mr. Amalet proposed at\r\n    Versails; for to the contrary when         was spoke to who lived\r\n    in the neighbourhood of where they proposed to land, concerning\r\n    the providing of these several Necessary he said he had no Idea\r\n    that any thing had been so suddenly designed for the King, so\r\n    could make no promises. Mr. Butler, the Gentleman sent over by\r\n    the King of France to enquire into the Situation of the Country,\r\n    was introduced by his Lordship to the most of the people. He\r\n    knew and was sent to the Country to a meeting at Litchfield\r\n    Races there to meet with Lord B[arrymor]e, Sir W[atkin Williams]\r\n    W[ynn][181] where he was with about 80 or more gentlemen all of\r\n    them but one reckoned honest people, which to be sure gave a\r\n    good aspect to the party in general; but nevertheless I don’t\r\n    see he went away with such a satisfactory account as Mr. Amalet\r\n    seemed to require. He assured my Lord he had several Instructions\r\n    from the King himself, but I wish his principall Errand may not\r\n    have been to purchase horses with a View to the Kings equipage\r\n    for the insuing Campaign, he having bought to the value of 3 or\r\n    4000£. This reflection may seem harsh but I cannot reconcile\r\n    their bestowing that sum upon horses for which he said they had\r\n    no Occasion only by a way of blind and not allowing the prince\r\n    not above one half of it for a whole years expences, and I don’t\r\n    think it would be just to argue in opposition to it that they\r\n    then knew nothing of the Campaign his Majesty intended to make.\r\n    The french are rather too far sighted not to allow them to design\r\n    so short a while as some moneths before hand. In short from his\r\n    Lordships return till the moneth of february we had no Letters\r\n    from france. In the interim L[ochie]l went to the Highlands when\r\n    he acquainted Sir J[ames] C[ampbell] and Lord L[ova]t with all\r\n    yt had passed and that we soon expected the french would come to\r\n    a final determination one or tother. We spent the time greatly\r\n    shagerin’d, vex’d to have no Accounts of any kind considering\r\n    that Mr. Drummond promised at his leaving London in Company with\r\n    Mr. Butler to write over immediately. Att last we received two\r\n    letters, one inclosing another Copy, of which I shall insert Copy\r\n    of Mr. Drummonds Letter to the Earl of T[ra]q[uai]r, dated ...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter I had made this answer with the Consent and advice of the Duke of\r\nP[erth] and was signed by them, the nixt day being Ash Wedensday[182]\r\nhis Grace resolved to leave the place being apprehensive that as the\r\nnewspapers were there very full of the french preparations he might\r\nbe suspected and seized and so not in his power to appear when any\r\nthing came to be done. My Lord T[ra]q[uai]r, att whose Lodgings I had\r\nthe Honour to meet his Grace that mourning, was very much against\r\nhis leaving the place in such a hurry, and on that day especially. I\r\nlikewise took the Liberty to remonstrate to him a little against it but\r\nall to no purpose and he accordingly sett out about Eleven O Clock and\r\nwent that night the Length of Dumblain. This was immediately looked\r\nupon by the people of the Government with a very jealous Eye and the\r\nmore so that his Brother Lord J[oh]n had come to Scotland some little\r\ntime before upon a Scheme of raising a Scots Regiment for the french\r\nService, stayed only ten days or little more at Edinburgh and went from\r\nthat to the Highlands to solicite the Gentlemen there to be assisting\r\nto him in making his Levies. It unluckily hapened for the Duke that\r\nupon the back of Lord J[oh]ns going to the Country the Government began\r\nto be alarmed with the Accounts of the Princes being come to france and\r\nthe intended invasion in his Majestys interest which made our little\r\nMinisters conjecture that Lord J[oh]n had been sent over with the\r\naccounts of it to the Highlands and consequently that the Duke had left\r\nthe town with an intention to foment an insurrection in the Country.\r\nThis was made no secret of, being publickly talked of immediately upon\r\nthe Duke disappearing two days, so after his leaving the town a servant\r\nof his was dispatched to London with the Letter I had wrote to Mr.\r\nDrummond their being no other means of conveiying one to him but by\r\nexpress, we not having any settled Cannal of Correspondence from hence\r\nthere. This I think was about the 8th or 10th of february [1744]. My\r\nLord T[ra]q[uai]r stayed some days in town after, designedly to create\r\nno suspicion.\r\n\r\nIn about a week or so after I went on a Sunday Evening to see Mr.\r\nH[a]y[183][184] who, when I was talking in a ludicrous way of the\r\nparagraph in the papers about the manner in which his Highness had left\r\nItaly, he told me in a very serious way that it was no Joke and said\r\nthat the sooner I went to the Country the better as my living quietly\r\nat home would give no suspicion to the Government, but if I stayed any\r\ntime in town he did not know what might happen, that upon his honour he\r\nhad not heard me mentioned, which perhaps was owing to my near Relation\r\nwith him, but that att that same time I was suspected to correspond\r\nwith Rome. I told him I intended to stay some days longer in Town and\r\nwould so soon as I had formerly proposed, that I had no cause of fear\r\nand so would not run away, and as to their suspecting my corresponding\r\nwith Rome, that I laughed at but thanked him for his kind concern. I\r\nwas not at all sorry to find they were so alarmed and afraid, which to\r\nme appeared a sure sign of their weakness, and indeed their fear for\r\nsome days after increased to the most abject pusilanimity. His saying\r\nthat he had not heard me mentioned was telling plainly that they had\r\nbeen consulting of who were the persons first to be laid hands; and\r\nI am apt to believe had the management of affairs been left to Lord\r\nArniston,[185] Sir John Inglis,[186] Commissioner Arthburthnet[187]\r\nand the rest of the present Ministry there would have been little\r\nlenity shown any Body they had the least reason to suspect. But\r\naffairs were afterwards taken out of their hands and putt into these\r\nof Justice Clerks,[188] who tho’ as Violent a Whig yet not so hott\r\nand Violent a Man. I went next day, being Munday, in the morning to\r\nwait of General Guest, who then Commanded in Chief in Scotland[189]\r\nwith a View to hear what a Notion or Idea he had of matters. He told\r\nme that the Repeal of the Habeas Corpus Act was expected that night\r\nby the Post, but added that, was it come, upon his honour he did not\r\nknow a man he suspected enough to lay up, which I was exceedingly\r\nwell pleased with. Also att the same time I could have marked out a\r\ngreat many and the general seemed not in the least to be affraid and\r\nlaughed att the hurry and confusion the other folks were. I was taken\r\nvery ill that day after dinner and gave up thoughts of going to Mr.\r\nHunters of Poolmood’s Burrial[190] which was to be on the Thursday,\r\nand I was desired out by the Widow on the tuesday, which evening about\r\nsix O Clock Mr. Mc[Douga]ll[191] brought me a Letter directed to the\r\nCountess of T[ra]q[uai]r. As I was then expecting one every day from\r\nMr. Drummond, as he had promised in his last, I began to suspect a\r\nlittle notwithstanding it had come by the Common Post, a very odd\r\nmethod of Conveyance. In such a critical juncture I opened it when I\r\nfound a blank Cover and Still directed as before. This confirmed me\r\nin my suspicion and under that I found a Letter for my Lord which I\r\nimmediately opened and tho’ partly in Cypher, could easily understand\r\nthat things were directly to be putt in execution. This struck me a\r\ngood deal as I said I would not go to the Country. However, I sent Mr.\r\nMc[Douga]ll with directions immediately to sent the Letter off to Lord\r\nT[ra]q[uai]r and to desire D. C[     ]n[192] to come down as of no\r\ndesign and tell me I might go to the Country next day if I pleased,\r\nwhich he accordingly did and hyrred a Chaise, not being able to ride.\r\nIn the mean while Sir J. S[tewar]t came to see me, who I acquainted of\r\nit and att the same time wrote a Letter to Lord K[enmu]re who I had\r\nspoke to the Munday before, desiring him to meet me at T[ra]q[uai]r\r\nthe thursday night as likewise one to Mr. J[oh]n Mc[leo]d[193] telling\r\nhim I thought it would be fitt to send Sir J[ames] C[ampbe]lls son to\r\nthe Highlands, who his father designed should serve him therein being\r\nassistant to raise the Country. I accordingly sett out next mourning\r\nfor the Country and the day following Lord T[ra]q[uai]r mett me at\r\nPolmood and shewed me the Letter when decyphered which I shall here\r\ngive a Copy off, and att the same time a Letter he had received the\r\nnight before by express from Edinburgh telling him that their was\r\na Warrant out to apprehend him which determined his Lordship to go\r\nimmediately to the D[uke] of P[erth]. Upon which so soon as the Burrial\r\nwas over we came to my house, where I wrote a Letter to Lord K[enmu]re\r\ndesiring he would follow us next mourning to Hartrie[194] where we\r\nintended to sleep that night and sent it Express to T[ra]q[uai]r with\r\nother Letters of my Lords, expecting Lord K[enmo]re would be there that\r\nnight, but he nevertheless continued the whole time in Edinburgh. We\r\nset out next day from Hartrie which was the fryday, that the french\r\nfleet was dispersed and the Transports run a Shore,[195] and the night\r\nafter gott to Drummond Castle, from whence his Grace sent immediately\r\nan express with the Copy of the last Letter we received to L[ochie]l.\r\nWe continued som weeks there always in Expectation to hear of a landing\r\nand in the mean time heard that several informations was given in\r\nagainst the Duke of Perth as having numbers of armed men about his\r\nhouse which was absolutely false. At last a party of 150 foot and\r\n30 Horse were sent from Stirling to make him Prisoner, but he had\r\nintelligence of it and went out of the way.[196] All this time Lord\r\nT[ra]q[uai]r was sculking about the Country having returned from the\r\njaunt he had made over the Highlands.\r\n\r\nAfter staying in that Country till the beginning of Aprile, without\r\nreceiving any Accounts from abroad and giving up all hopes of a\r\nLanding, I left my Lord T[ra]q[uai]r there and came to Stirlingshire\r\nwhere I stayed about three weeks and so came to Edinburgh, and from\r\nthat went to the Country the 11th of May. In the beginning of June,\r\nwhen Lord T[ra]q[uai]r returned, I went to wait of him, and being very\r\nuneasy to think we had received no accounts from Abroad, I said if I\r\ncould afford the expence I would go over on pretence of seeing the Army\r\nin flanders and so see the Prince myself and learn distinctly what\r\nsituation things were in. This his Lordship was well pleased with but\r\nI did not say anything positively, but upon Reflexion by the Road, I\r\nthought it was hard that people who had been for so long concerned in\r\nthe Kings affairs and putt to so great Charge about it with the hazard\r\nof their Lives and fortunes should now be left in the dark as to every\r\nthing. Wherefore I resolved to do it, and next day wrote a Letter to\r\nmy Lord telling him that if the Duke of P[erth] would give me a 100£\r\nI would be att the rest of the expence myself and go over and in case\r\nhis Lordship approved of it, he would be so good as meet me at Peebles\r\non Saturday, which he did, and after talking with him I came home and\r\nsett out the same night about     O Clock and gott to Drummond [Castle]\r\nnext afternoon. The Duke immediately agreed to the thing and gave me\r\nan order for the money. About this time came a letter from Lord Semple\r\nto Lord T[ra]q[uai]r by way of an account of their precedure in the\r\nSpring, which I went to T[ra]q[uai]r and assisted his Lordship to\r\ndecypher, but was so little to our satisfaction that my Lord still\r\nthought my going over more necessary than before. About this time I\r\nreceived a letter from St[uar]t of Ard[shie]ll,[197] telling me that\r\nhe would have come to the Country to wait of me but his dress made him\r\nremarkable, being in Highland Cloaths, but as he had comed to Town\r\npurposely to meet with me, he hoped I would give him a meeting, and yt\r\nhe had seen L[ochie]l lately. I went to town in a day or two after and\r\ndined with him. His Errand was to know of me if I had gott any Accounts\r\nlately, and what hopes I had. I did not think it att all proper to\r\nlet him know any thing of my having seen such a letter as Lord Semple\r\nhad wrote, nor indeed that any Accounts had come; for in that case he\r\nwould have expected something positive. But I put him off by telling\r\nhim I imagined the french were resolved to renew the Expedition soon\r\nand so friends did not care to write least any discovery should ensue,\r\nbut could easily see that the Answer was not att all satisfactory. I\r\nreturned that same night to the Country, and during a few days that I\r\nstayed, prepared for my journey.\r\n\r\n\r\nN.B.--_This is a fragment of a letter written by Mr. Murray to the\r\nPretender soon after the miscarriage of the French Expedition._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murray to the Chevalier]\r\n\r\n    It was looked upon by some as certain, and thought necessary\r\n    by all, that Mr. Watson[198] should come over, as he was the\r\n    person who had gone through the whole Highlands and gott the\r\n    engagements of the Several Gentlemen at his first leaving\r\n    Scotland, and surely had any of them been so little as to flinch\r\n    from what they engaged to him, he was the natural and indeed\r\n    the only person that could have upbraided them into their Duty.\r\n    My Lord says he could trust to no conveyance, and so could not\r\n    soonner give us any information your Majestys friend is here,\r\n    upon Mr. D[rummond] not coming, expected immediately after the\r\n    Embargo was taken of in france that some one or other would\r\n    have been dispatched to our Coasts with an account of what had\r\n    passed, and what was to be hoped for, that so we might have\r\n    regulate our fortunes Conduct accordingly. The neglect of this,\r\n    Sir, greatly surprises your Majestys friends in generall, and\r\n    gives the Gentlemen in the concert a good deal of Umbrage, as\r\n    they thereby think themselves slighted and neglected, whereas,\r\n    they being the first promoters of the whole scheme, they humbly\r\n    think entitled them to have the most expidetious information.\r\n    His Lordship next supposes that we are fully satisfied of the\r\n    french sincerity, which indeed is entirely otherwise, especially\r\n    from the Reasons he assigns that it was owing to the commandants\r\n    neglect or disobedience to his Instructions. We never can bring\r\n    ourselves to believe that any man (especially a french subject)\r\n    grown old with an untainted and great Reputation, durst have\r\n    disobeyed what seems to have been the only Material part of his\r\n    Instructions to block up Portsmouth, and surely, if not for\r\n    this one Errand his Voyage to the Chunnel must rather do harm\r\n    than good, which was evidently seen by the Government being put\r\n    timeously upon their Guard. As to his next paragraph relating to\r\n    the frenches cautious delay purposely to see what Influence the\r\n    powers of the Court would have upon your Majestys friends here,\r\n    and that the above cautious delay was grating to the Prince;\r\n    no wonder indeed his Royal Highness had too penetrating an Eye\r\n    not to see that it would be impossible to recover this Time and\r\n    opportunity he was losing. But what really quite astonishes us\r\n    is his Lordships saying that from the light it was represented\r\n    in, their caution seemed to be well grounded. We cant pretend to\r\n    take their Reasons to [heart] as they are not told us, but we are\r\n    affraid they consist more in plausible pretences, dressed up with\r\n    a little french Rhetorick, than in strong and solid Arguments.\r\n    We are in this Climate generally accustomed to the plainer sort\r\n    of speach, and we cannot help thinking ourselves judges of it.\r\n    Did not the french Court know of Comns.?[199] Did they not know\r\n    that that Majority would pass all Bills that might seem their\r\n    Master? Did they not know that the repeal of the Habeas Corpus\r\n    act would naturally be the first step and that by that Repeal\r\n    they were enabled to take up every person they suspected? Did\r\n    they not know that the principal men in England, of your Majestys\r\n    friends, were in the house and that not one of them durst object\r\n    to any method that was proposed as their offering. Such would\r\n    have been an open declaration of their principles, and must\r\n    consequently have caused their confinement. Did they not know\r\n    that the English are a fickle sort of people, and that they had\r\n    a natural abhorence of the french nation, and thay could not\r\n    be ignorant that this was giving them time to frighten them by\r\n    the fear of a french Influence that State pretence and thereby\r\n    to make friends in the City of London. If they were Ignorant of\r\n    all these they ought surely to have been told, and we must be of\r\n    opinion that these as such Indisputable Reasons that no Sound\r\n    Arguments could be adduced to confute them, which, when rightly\r\n    observed, makes their Schemes of delaying it for a little time\r\n    appear vain and frivolous pretences and absolutely contradictory\r\n    to all Right Reason. We are convinced that his Royal Highness,\r\n    keeping so quiet has effectually deceived the Government, that it\r\n    is entirely owing to his own matchless address, and indeed upon\r\n    decyphering the Letter My Lord T[ra]q[uai]r and I thought that we\r\n    was in the next line to have had orders to keep in readyness to\r\n    favour a discent to be made, upon the D[uke] of H[amilton] and\r\n    the Dutch troops going over; but to our unexpressible Surprise\r\n    he proposes new assurances to be given both from Scotland and\r\n    England. In the name of Wonder what can all this mean? Where\r\n    are the Grounds? Where the Reasons, where the necessity leading\r\n    to such a demand? The assurances from Scotland were thought\r\n    sufficient by the K[ing], by C[ardinal] F[leury] and by Mr.\r\n    Amalot. From the first moment the assurances carried over by Mr.\r\n    Butler last year from England were thought sufficient, otherwise\r\n    the french would not have carried the Expidition so far. If this\r\n    is the case (which we have all along been made believe) what is\r\n    the necessity for any Renewal of them? What a horrid and Gloomy\r\n    prospect must such a Scheme carry along with it, things have been\r\n    carried on for some years with great Secrecy and caution, tho’\r\n    with danger of Life and fortune to those concerned, and must they\r\n    now recommence such another tedious and dangerous Negotiation?\r\n    I am afraid, Sir, if your Majesty should find it necessary it\r\n    will be next to impossible, at lest my Lord T[ra]q[uai]r never\r\n    can take a hand doing any thing in England, he is already\r\n    strongly suspected and it wanted but little he was not taken up\r\n    some moneths ago. The express he sent to London with a Letter\r\n    to Watson[200] was seized, which was occasioned by one from him\r\n    which left us quite in the dark as to what assistance we were to\r\n    have, and that within 3 weeks of the Expidition, but not till he\r\n    had delivered his Packet; and had he not luckyly said he believed\r\n    it Related to a marriage which was then the talk of the town,\r\n    his Lordship had surely been arested. But if the English are so\r\n    well satisfied with the procedure of the french, and the open\r\n    discovery of any plot, why cant they find one amongst themselves\r\n    to do the Business? I shall be sorry to think they have only a\r\n    view to gain time till they see whither they are able to carry\r\n    on the War in spite of Brittain, and then tell us that the Zeal\r\n    shown for the present Government in the time of the Expidition\r\n    contradicts all the assurances we advanced to the contrary, which\r\n    will be the Result of their Cautious and well delay for a little\r\n    time. This is harsh, but other people have seen, and I have read\r\n    of france doing the like in other cases. As to the troops to\r\n    be landed in Scotland, suppose it to be impossible to converse\r\n    with all the concert on it att any time in two moneths, and all\r\n    present not to be done at all, yett I can take upon me to affirm\r\n    that they still continue in the same mind as to every Article.\r\n    3000 men landed, one half near Sir J[ames] Cam[pbe]ll to command\r\n    Argyle Shire, the other half near Inverness, a L[ochie]l may join\r\n    them to command the north, or if the one half can’t reach near\r\n    to Sir J[ames] C[ampbell], lett them be all landed together with\r\n    4 feild pieces, 15 or 20,000 Stand of Arms, Gones, Pistoles and\r\n    broad Swords, yett from the inquiry I have made I am satisfied\r\n    10,000 Guns or less, 10,000 Broad Swords and as many Pistoles\r\n    will sufficiently do the Business, as all the Isles are lately\r\n    Armed with Guns and most of them Swords, Likewise, as for the\r\n    Inland Country, they want Swords and Pistoles very much. It\r\n    gives us great uneasiness that my Lord M[arischal] should be so\r\n    unhappy as to fly in the face of every Scheme, if he himself\r\n    does not project. _Sed quos Deus vult perdere dementit prius_,\r\n    but we cannot help thinking oddnt, when the money was had to\r\n    pay Sir J[ames] Mr. Watson did not care to remit it. This to be\r\n    sure required no Conveyance, a Bill was sufficient. He knows the\r\n    miserable Situation he is in, and tho’ the rest of the Concert\r\n    are in no such Indigent Situation, yett their Circumstances are\r\n    not so opulent as to assist him. The Gentlemen in the Highlands\r\n    were so desirous to know if any accounts were come that Locheal\r\n    gave a Commission to St[ewart] of A[rdshiel] who came expressly\r\n    to meet with me and indeed I was so Anxious for the Situation of\r\n    your Majestys friends, that I resolved upon a journey abroad to\r\n    inform myself of every thing, upon the pretence of going to see\r\n    the Army to some who had a title to be a little more Curious upon\r\n    pretence of making more interest for a Company in the Dutch in\r\n    case of any new levies, so that it was an accident I either mett\r\n    with that Gentleman or saw my Lord S[emple] letter. He complained\r\n    heavily that we had no Accounts from abroad, and indeed I never\r\n    had more difficulty to excuse our friends. However, I told that\r\n    our having none looked well as it portended that the expidition\r\n    had surely suffered some short delay from the bad weather that\r\n    had happened at the time, and as it was soon to be resumed,\r\n    they thought it needless to send us any information in case of\r\n    discoveries, which nevertheless cou’d observe did not entirely\r\n    Satisfie him. My Lord T[raquair] desired me to assure your\r\n    Majesty that there is nothing he would not undertake which\r\n    might     further your Majestys interest but that he cannot come\r\n    from his own house to Edinburgh without being suspected, which\r\n    renders it impossible for him to negotiate any thing in England,\r\n    and at the same time desires me to observe that he cannot\r\n    reconceal that part of my Lord S[emple’s] Letter, where he tells\r\n    him that nothing will be fixed with relation to the expidition\r\n    till he hear from him with his proposals of fresh assurances\r\n    from your Majestys friends here. In short, Sir, I must say that\r\n    this letter is of such a nature that I do not take it upon me to\r\n    intimate it to the Gentlemen in the Concert as in the present\r\n    Situation Your Majestys Wisdom, the inexpressible Character the\r\n    Prince has acquired as being of so brave and enterprising a\r\n    Spirit, together with their own Suspence and hopes are what keep\r\n    up their Spirits, but was I to make it knowen to them I am afraid\r\n    it would throw them into a fatal Despondency, so till I have your\r\n    Majestys orders am resolved to keep it private. Never was there\r\n    a people more anxiously concerned about a princes happiness and\r\n    welfare than this nation when she heard of Highness imbarkation,\r\n    nor do I believe Scotland ever made a more unanimous Appearance\r\n    than they would have done then, provided the Conditions promised\r\n    them had been performed, but we have been told here, how justly\r\n    I won’t say, that there was only 3000 Muskets designed for us\r\n    without any troops, indeed, we are able, at any time, to command\r\n    our own Country with Arms and officers, especially now when there\r\n    is only four Regiments of foot and two of Dragoons, and each of\r\n    these 100 Men draughted to flanders. I am sorry to be obliged\r\n    to trouble your Majesty with so long a paper, but I am hopefull\r\n    your Majesty will be of opinion our present Situation required\r\n    it especially after receiving the inclosed, nor do I fear your\r\n    Majestys being angry upon that account as I most humbly beg\r\n    leave to say that an honest and loyal Subject can never explain\r\n    himself too fully and Clearly to a wise Prince, and since the\r\n    Receipt of Lord S[emple] letter I am more fully resolved to make\r\n    my journey abroad as I think there is more Reason for full and\r\n    pointed explications on every Article, and if I don’t thereby\r\n    hurt your Majestys affairs of what at present I have no idea I\r\n    shall be quite indifferent as what may be the consequence with\r\n    regard to myself, being Void of all other Views but that of\r\n    promoting your Majestys Interest, which I shall ever endeavour\r\n    to do att all hazard. I most humbly beg this letter may not\r\n    be made known to my Lord S[emple] and Mr. W[atson][201] least\r\n    it unreasonably make differences amongst those concerned in\r\n    your Majestys affairs, but if sending them a Copy will in your\r\n    Majestys opinion be of any Service, I can with great Satisfaction\r\n    sacrifice the private Regard of any man to the trueth and to my\r\n    King and Country.\r\n\r\n\r\n_This seems to be a Copy of a Letter which Mr. Murray wrote after his\r\nreturn from France and Flanders in the Moneths of September or October,\r\n1744, To the young Pretender, then in France._[202]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murray to Prince Charles]\r\n\r\n    SIR,--It gives me the most Concern I should have been so long\r\n    in this Country without having it in my power to acquaint your\r\n    Royal Highness with what has passed since I left France, except\r\n    in the short Letter I was necessitate to write from London under\r\n    Cover to Mr. Lumly or Maxwell.[203] I dont now remember whilst\r\n    being then able to find no other conveyance and since my Arrival\r\n    here, there has been no Occasion till the present tho’ I have\r\n    laid myself out to find one, as I might not so distinctly as I\r\n    incline, acquaint your Royal Highness of every thing by way of\r\n    letter. I have taken the Liberty to write in form of a journal\r\n    with opinions of the several Persons I have had occasion to talk\r\n    to.\r\n\r\n    I sett out from Senlis[204] on Wednesday morning and on Thursday\r\n    night came to Brussels. From thence I went next day to Termonde,\r\n    where I mett with 636, 616, 1614, 12, 30, 1392,[205] who I spoke\r\n    to as ordered by Mr. Burnet.[206] He seemed a little Timerous at\r\n    first, but nevertheless promised to do all in his power with his\r\n    Brother Officers, and to write Mr. Fisher[206] under the name\r\n    of Burnet subscribing himself Cuming. On the Saturday I went to\r\n    425, 1876, 1614,[207] in Company with Mr. 434, 1054, 1730,[208]\r\n    to whom I spoke all night and found him so frank as to give me\r\n    his word of honour that he would come over immediately upon my\r\n    writing to him that he would use his Interest with the 1495 of\r\n    his 598, 1614,[209] and go to Charleroy and talk with Some of\r\n    Coaliers[210] and promised likewise to Send me over a list of\r\n    the recruiting officers for this year, with a mark to those that\r\n    might be spoke to. From that came to Rotterdam on Saturday where\r\n    he informed me that there was nothing easier than to gett Arms of\r\n    all kinds by applying to any Jew att Amsterdam who would oblige\r\n    himself upon a penalty to give any number att whatever port in\r\n    Holland we desired, and that as this was done dayly, it would\r\n    create no Suspicion. There mett with 1389, 1051, C13,[211] to\r\n    whom I repeated what had passed from the time I left him, and\r\n    delivered him two letters from Mr. Burnet[206] with which he\r\n    seemed exceedingly well pleased. I had many conversations with\r\n    him on these Subjects, and upon the whole he was, and still is\r\n    of Opinion that the English will not be brought to enter upon\r\n    any Scheme without a foreign force, and that Mr. Burnet’s[212]\r\n    coming to Scotland without their concurrence must be of the\r\n    worse consequence, as from that quarter alone their did not\r\n    appear the least probability of Success; for which reason, if the\r\n    french do not putt in Execution the following Spring what they\r\n    proposed the passed, he proposes as the dernier Resort to make\r\n    an offer to the King of the Crown of Scotland upon the footing\r\n    of the Antient Allience with France; but of this I shall say\r\n    nothing, leaving to him to explain it himself, and as to raising\r\n    a Sum of money is of Opinion it will be very difficult, if at\r\n    all possible. On the friday Se-en night,[213] after leaving\r\n    Senlis I arrived att London and nixt morning went to wait of Mr.\r\n    Moore[214] but missed him, however in the evening I gott him at\r\n    home but found him quite a different man from what I had left\r\n    him, very reserved and did not offer to show me any letter he\r\n    had received during my Absence tho’ Martin[215] informed me he\r\n    had given him one the post before. I then talked to him a little\r\n    different of the frenches intentions, at least for this Winter\r\n    season, to which he answered he looked upon the King of France\r\n    as a man of honour, and that to be sure he would not give Mr.\r\n    Fisher[212] such promises if he did not seriously intend to serve\r\n    him. I endeavoured to show him from the then Situation of the\r\n    french officers that it was unreasonable to expect it, but all\r\n    to no purpose. Then I told him that Mr. Fisher desired Letters\r\n    so and so adressed should Morris,[216] this he said was not in\r\n    his power for he did not know the person in the City forwarded\r\n    them, but promised to speak with Martin, who was acquainted\r\n    with, and usually carried his Letters, who was acquainted with\r\n    him. I nixt spoke to him of raising a Sum of money to purchase\r\n    Arms as likewise a few thousand pounds for Mr. Burnets[217] Own\r\n    Use who was much pinched by the small allowance he had from\r\n    Mr. Adams.[218] He told me that was what he could say nothing\r\n    off, but that he knew their had been a Sum remitted to him last\r\n    Spring by the way of Amsterdam. I then asked him to suppose\r\n    the case that the french would do nothing, whether he imagined\r\n    Saville[219] would join heartily with Sanderson[220] to bring\r\n    about 407. Smith;[221] to which he answered as before, about the\r\n    money that he knew nothing about it and so would not give his\r\n    Opinion. Upon which I enjoined him upon Mr. Burnets[217] Name\r\n    to mention that to none but whom Mr. Bright[222] and he should\r\n    agree upon his Coming to Town, and desired to know how soon he\r\n    thought that should be, which he still answered as before. From\r\n    all which I could plainly see he had gott his Lesson from the\r\n    other side. What made this the more obvious to me, in talking of\r\n    raising money to purchase Arms, I told him it would be absolutely\r\n    necessary, for tho’ in Diepe[223] we had men and them very\r\n    willing to fight, yet we had no money, and Arms for not above\r\n    7000 if so many; A number far inferior to what I had before told\r\n    him would appear. Upon which he immediately indeavoured to catch\r\n    me by saying he hoped I had got no bad news from Doit[224] to\r\n    Occasion my Diminishing the number of Loyalists which obliged me\r\n    to explain the matter by telling him that in 1829, 1274, 1381,\r\n    1721,[225] a Gentleman [whose] following consisted perhaps of\r\n    800 had not arms for above one half and so of the rest, by which\r\n    means they all in general when spoke to, declared they were not\r\n    Armed. This, he no doubt did with Intent to find me out in a\r\n    Contradiction which he could not have failed to represent to his\r\n    friends on the other side by the first post, who would have\r\n    made their own use of it with Mr. Burnet.[226] Two days after,\r\n    I went again to wait of him and enquire if he had settled that\r\n    Correspondence as Mr. Fisher[226] desired, when he told me with\r\n    great indifference that he had never spoke of it, and that the\r\n    packets were to be stoped going any Longer from Dover to Calais,\r\n    so that their must be a new conveyance settled, but how that was\r\n    to be done he did not know. I then left him, and wrote the Short\r\n    Letter I before mentioned to Mr. Burnet.[226] Then sett out for\r\n    Doit, and on tuesday the 2d of October met with 1443, 1721, 530,\r\n    1489, 699, 1051, 1798,[227] a young Gentleman of a very large\r\n    fortune, who I acquainted in general with my having seen Mr.\r\n    Fisher[226] and what he proposed, upon which he very frankly\r\n    offered to raise a sum of Money provided the others who I told\r\n    off were to be applyed he would agree to it and that he would\r\n    stay some time longer than he proposed, having intended to go\r\n    to London, and is now in this place but of Opinion that nothing\r\n    can be done without either a foreign force or the concurrence\r\n    of Sidley.[228] Upon tuesday the ninth of October, I sent an\r\n    Express to Mr. Bright,[229] then at the Earl of Nidsdales, and\r\n    upon thursday morning he came to my house where I acquainted him\r\n    with everything I had done from my Arrival at London. He seemed\r\n    very much concerned that so many years and so much money had\r\n    been spent to no purpose, but as he was obliged to return early\r\n    nixt morning would not give his Opinion of the present footing\r\n    things were on till his return home. Upon the 16th, I went with\r\n    an intention to see Sir 1293, 43C, 1055, 1744, 1045, 1948, 1679,\r\n    1778,[230] and inform him fully of Mr. Burnets[226] resolutions,\r\n    but found he was in fife, and his family uncertain of his Return,\r\n    so proceeded to Edinburgh from whence I wrote the 18th of October\r\n    to Mr. Fergus,[231] begging he would meet me at Mr. Brights[229]\r\n    house about the 26th, and one inclosed to Mr. Dan,[232] desiring\r\n    him to come immediately. I soon received a letter informing me\r\n    that Mr. Dan was come, and desired to see me, but as at this time\r\n    my wife was taken very ill, I sent a servant that same night to\r\n    town desiring the favour of a visit from him in the Country,\r\n    which he declined, thinking it would look too suspicious as I\r\n    was so lately come home and he only two days in Town, so rather\r\n    choose to delay it for som little time. I likewise received a\r\n    letter from Mr. Fergus,[233] telling me he could not for some\r\n    weeks see me. I was now become very uneasy to think I had been\r\n    for above a moneth in the Country without being able to do any\r\n    thing, when luckily, about the     of the moneth Mr. Bright[234]\r\n    called on me in his very home and promised to be in town 3 or 4\r\n    days after, which determined me to go nixt day, and that night\r\n    I mett with Mr. Bright (who had been called by express) and\r\n    Mr. Dan, when I read them a journal of what had passed from my\r\n    leaving Diepe the 7th of July, and acquainted them with Mr.\r\n    Burnets[235] Resolutions in case the french failed him. They were\r\n    both well pleased with the proposal of Sidly and Sanderson[236]\r\n    acting in conjuncion, but Equally against Mr. Fisher’s[235]\r\n    relying upon Sanderson alone. I nixt day gave Mr. Dan the Letter\r\n    designed for Nicolson,[237] which he delivered to him, and made\r\n    an apointment to meet with me the same night which he accordingly\r\n    did; but as he had drunk a little too much we differred having\r\n    any positive answer from him. I told Mr. Dan there was a\r\n    necessity for the other Letters being delivered immediately and\r\n    that I depended upon him to do it. Found, as he was then about\r\n    getting his Charter from the Duke of Argyle, and had given that\r\n    for the reason of his coming up, it was impossible for him to\r\n    Return without giving Suspicion. I for the second time had the\r\n    misfortune to miss Sir 1293, 43C, 1055, 1744, 1045, 948, 1679,\r\n    1778,[238] being gone to his house in the West, nor have I yett\r\n    been able to see him, as I have almost ever since been obliged to\r\n    Stay in this place. I left town munday 12 and returned thursday\r\n    the 15th, where Mr. Dan came to me before dinner and told me\r\n    that young Kinny[239] desired to speak with me, so I agreed to\r\n    meet him that Evening Att 4 o’Clock, where he informed me that\r\n    Lord Semple[240] and Mr. Drummond had refused to do Business\r\n    any longer, that they had sent John Drummond[241] to him att\r\n    Dunkirk to acquaint him that I had made Mr. Burnet[242] believe\r\n    they were not trusted by his friends, and that they had then a\r\n    prospect on the _Tapis_ but had given it up, and told him that\r\n    I had at the same time perswaded Mr. Fisher[243] to come ovir\r\n    with the intent to make himself 1357[244] and leave his father\r\n    att _Harfleur_,[245] which I take God to Witness I never since\r\n    mentioned to him as indeed it is one of the things in the world\r\n    most against my principles upon which alone I have always acted\r\n    in Mr. Ellis’s[246] affairs. Kinnys opinion of them, together\r\n    with what I told him, easily convinced him of the folly of their\r\n    Story.\r\n\r\n    Some few days after this Mr. Fergus[247] came to town and stayed\r\n    for near two weeks, he has procured the small Vessel by which\r\n    this comes, and will order it to and again so often as Occasion\r\n    shall offer. I had several conversations with him on the present\r\n    State of affairs, but shall confine them all to his Answer, we\r\n    shall he Subjoin with that of the rest, having gott them to putt\r\n    their several Opinions in writing. I shall there putt down Mr.\r\n    Fergus, Mr. Bright[248] and Mr. Dans[249] opinion with regard to\r\n    some of the Articles I was charged with in the memorandum. Which\r\n    notwithstanding they were (save Fergus) against Mr. Burnets[243]\r\n    coming over, at any rate to Doit,[250] I nevertheless insisted\r\n    upon it to show that I had not neglected any particular of my\r\n    orders, and first as to Mr. Brights[248] going to London he\r\n    proposes being there before the end of January, 2ndly The letters\r\n    wrote to the several persons for money should be delivered with\r\n    an Apology, that they could be wrote to in no other stile in\r\n    case they had miscarried, 3rdly, The place Mr. Burnet[243] was\r\n    to meet should be some small distance from Aberdeen, upon that\r\n    part of the Coast lying towards Dundee, and that we should here\r\n    be acquainted by one sent over a moneth before, of the day he\r\n    determined to sail, providing the weather favoured him, and the\r\n    moment he landed to send an express to Mr. Fergus,[249] and one\r\n    to Mr. Dan[247] with instructions what day they were to ...\r\n\r\n    [_Hiatus in MSS._]\r\n\r\n    4ly as to providing of Swords it is what they dayly do, but the\r\n    number to be had so small as not to be regarded. 5tly The making\r\n    of Hilts and Targets impossible to be done without a Discovery\r\n    and that a few days only is required to make the Targets so that\r\n    they can be provided without trouble. 6thly, As to a ship for\r\n    Arms, Mr. Fergus engaged to provide it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORIAL CONCERNING THE HIGHLANDS WRITTEN BY ALEXANDER MACBEAN, A.M.\r\nMINISTER OF INVERNESS\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Inverness, 10 Octr. 1746._\r\n\r\nThe Islands of Orkney and Shetland I know little about.[251]\r\n\r\nThe Shire of Caithness is inhabited chiefly by StClairs and Dunbars.\r\nThe Earl of Caithness is Chief of the StClairs who are by far more\r\nnumerous than the other. I know not the precise number of men they\r\ncan raise but I have heard that at the Battle of     [252] fought by\r\nthem against the late Earl of Breadalbin, I think in the reign of King\r\nWilliam, they had about 1500 men Horse and Foot. But several gentlemen\r\nof that name living in the Orknies would on such ocasion with their\r\nmen join their friends on the Continent. Mr. James Gilchrist, Minister\r\nat Thurso,[253] happened to be walking with a gentleman in Summer 1744\r\nwho found a letter on the road which when opened was found to be writ\r\nin Cypher by a gentleman of the name of StClair to a correspondent at\r\nEdinburgh mentioning that Shuch and Shuch would be ready at a Call\r\neach with his number of men plainly exprest; all the names were in\r\nCypher nor could I learn the precise number. Mr. Gilchrist could not\r\nprevail with the gentleman to let him have the keeping of the letter,\r\nhowever this discovery was useful as it put the Lords Sutherland and\r\nReay on their guard. ’Twas talked here in time of the Rebellion that\r\nthe StClairs would have joined the Pretender but that they durst not\r\npass through Lord Sutherland’s country[254] as his men were in arms\r\njoined by the McKays, some of the ministers of Caithness can inform you\r\nparticularly about this and about Sir James Stewart of Burrows[255] who\r\nlives in the Orknies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dunbars of Caithness_\r\n\r\nI could not as yet be informed how the Dunbars of Caithness behaved,\r\nSir William Dunbar of Hemprigs their Chief, is the principle man. He\r\nwas reckoned well affected to Church and State.\r\n\r\n\r\n_McKays of Strathnavar_\r\n\r\nNext to Caithness, Southward and on the Western coast, is Strathnavar\r\nthe country of Lord Reay, Chief of the McKays,[256] a zealous\r\nPresbyterian and revolutioner; with all his Clan he can raise as near\r\nas I can guess about 600 men. The part he acted last year is well\r\nknown. It will be always mentioned to his honour that by his zeal and\r\ndiligence he got the large Parish of Diurness divided into three and\r\nStipends made for each of them by a general Collection through Scotland\r\nand his own liberal assistance though his estate be but 10,000£ scots\r\nthere is scarce a family in this country but has been brought to have\r\nFamily Worship, though that People was of old very rude and barbarous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sutherland of Sutherland_\r\n\r\nNext to Caithness, Southward on the East coast, is the Earl of\r\nSutherland’s country, Chief of the name of Sutherland. His Lordship’s\r\naffection to our Constitution in Church and State is well known;[257]\r\nhe can raise ’twixt 1200 and 1500 men; his Estate is reckoned about\r\n£3000 scots but somewhat under burden.\r\n\r\n\r\n_McLeods of Assint_\r\n\r\nAs the Shires of Sutherland and Caithness make a Peninsula formed by\r\nthe Firth of Tain from the east Sea and an arm of the Western Ocean,\r\nthat I may describe the People and the Country more distinctly I will\r\ntravel along the Western Coast and then return Eastward.\r\n\r\nNext to Lord Reay’s country on the south side of the Firth called\r\nEdrachaolis and on the west coast is the country of Assint, belonging\r\nof old to a branch of the McLeod Family. This country fell into the\r\nhands of the McKenzies for debt in Charles the Second’s time.[258]\r\nMcLeod kept possession violently till Letters of Fire and Sword were\r\nexecuted against him by the Earl of Seaforth. The Commons there are\r\nchiefly McLeods. McLeod of Ginnies in east Ross is the heir male of\r\nthat family. He raised one of the independent Companies last year and\r\ncontinued in the Government’s service till dismissed a few weeks ago.\r\nHis dwelling is about 30 miles east from Assint. After the battle of\r\nPreston McDonald of Barisdale[259] with a few men went to that country\r\nand recruited about 60 men, but the Lord Reay’s or Lord Sutherland’s\r\npeople--I’m not sure which--fell upon him and [recaptured] the men. He\r\nand his company were obliged to take to their heels. This country is an\r\nentire parish, and prodigious rough and mountainous but famous for good\r\npasture and good cattle. A few of the Earl of Cromarties family lived\r\nhere and were obliged to go with him to the Rebellion. Viz. McKenzie of\r\nArdloch.\r\n\r\n\r\n_McLeods of Cogach_\r\n\r\nTo the south of Assint is the country of Cogach, a part of the parish\r\nof Loch-Broom formerly belonging to another family of the McLeods.\r\n[Margaret] McLeod of Cogach, the heiress of the family, was married\r\nto George, the first Earl of Cromarty.[260] This Earl, who was an\r\nantiquary, alleged that McLeod of Cogach was Chief of the whole clan,\r\nand consequently he as their representative, in right of his wife,\r\nprocured the Title of Lord McLeod from Queen Anne as his secondary\r\ntitle, and this country continued the property of the family till now.\r\nOut of Cogach and some branches of his family in Loch-Broom together\r\nwith the few I have mentioned from Assint, the Earl of Cromarty raised\r\nabove 200 men for the late Rebellion. What number he had altogether\r\nwill be mentioned when I come to the East Coast where he dwelt.\r\n\r\n\r\n_McKenzies of Loch-Broom_\r\n\r\nNext to Cogach is Loch-Broom, belonging to several small Heritors of\r\nthe name of McKenzie. John McKenzie of Ardloch and James McKenzie of\r\nCepoch, the only Papists that I know in all that tract of ground except\r\nthe Lady Assint, bred their children Protestants.\r\n\r\nNext is the Country of Gairloch, belonging mostly to McKenzies of\r\nGairloch.\r\n\r\n\r\n_McKenzies of Applecross and Loch-Carran_\r\n\r\nTo the south of it is Applecross a new erection in the year 1720. And\r\nnext to it Loch-Carran. To this last place, the Earl of Seaforth,[261]\r\nas we call him here, retired when the Rebels retreated North and\r\ngathered 600 or 800 of his men about him by which he kept them in\r\nreadiness for any service proper for him to do and preserved them from\r\nstraggling companies of the Rebels who went about recruiting men. This\r\nlast is the property of the Earl.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mathesons and Murchisons of Loch Ailsh_\r\n\r\nNext to the South is the country of Loch Ailsh the property of the\r\nSeaforth Family. The McDonalds of Glengarry of old pretended right to\r\nthe country and had many battles and skirmishes with the McKenzies\r\nabout it. The last was a Sea-fight in Birlins and Boats, with long\r\npoles, corn forks and Lochabyr axes, in which the McDonalds were\r\ndefeated, and Glengary with many of his company killed.[262] This\r\nhappened before the Reformation. Most of the Commons are Mathesons and\r\nMurchisons but they join the McKenzies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_McRaes of Kintail_\r\n\r\nNext to the South is the Parish of Kintail and the Parish of\r\nMuick[263] a new erection in the year 1726 taken from the old Parish\r\nof Kintail. The whole country goes under the name of Kintail. The\r\nbulk of the inhabitants are of the name of McRae, descended from the\r\nCampbells,[264] but they follow the Seaforth Family. Here lies Glen\r\nShiel.\r\n\r\nIn all this tract of ground, viz., from Lord Reay’s country on the\r\nnorth to Glenelg on the south, the people are but late converts to\r\nPresbytery. The old Episcopal Incumbents having lived long, some of\r\nthem till the year 29, I could not find that any of them took the\r\noaths to the Government. The gentlemen are most Episcopal and they or\r\ntheir predecessors were at Shirefmoor and Glen Sheil with the late\r\nSeaforth.[265] But by the good disposition of the present Seaforth\r\nto our happy establishment, they did not think fit to join in the\r\nlate Rebellion, excepting a few younger brothers who had nothing to\r\nlose and are now prisoners in London. The first Presbyterian Minister\r\nwas planted in Assint in the year 1727 at Loch-Broom. He landed much\r\nsooner, but though married to a native he was so miserable that he\r\ncould not live in the country.\r\n\r\nAfter him Mr. James Smith, now Minister at Creich in Sutherland, was\r\nordained for the place by the Presbytery of Dingwall. The first night\r\nhe came to his Parish both the eyes were plucked out his horse as his\r\nwelcome to the country. Applecross, Kintail and Muick were not planted\r\ntill the year 1730; Loch Carran in the year 1725. Mr. John McKilikin\r\nwas ordained at Dingwall for the parish of Loch Ailsh a good time ago\r\nand though he lived for several years, he never durst enter his parish,\r\nand after his death, the Presbytery who went there to command the\r\npeople about filling the parish in the year 1721 or 1722, were made\r\nprisoners in the house where they met, by men in women’s clothes, and\r\ntheir faces blackened. A pledge was demanded of them that they should\r\nnever come to that country, which they refusing, they sent a Guard\r\nof this black crew with each of them towards their respective homes.\r\nBut in the year 1727 a minister was planted there who got peaceable\r\npossession. In all or most of these parishes the Sacrament of the\r\nSupper has been lately administered and the Commons are already much\r\nrecovered from their blindness and bigotry, and some of the gentlemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_The Long Island_][266]\r\n\r\nIn all this tract of ground there are no Papists but what I have\r\nnamed. I know the country minutely, and ministers are tolerably well\r\naccommodated in Stipend, Manse, and Glebe. I will speak of the number\r\nof men Seaforth can raise when I come to the east side of the country\r\nwhere his seat stands.\r\n\r\nOpposite to the coast I have been describing is the Long Island. That\r\npart of it to the North, called Lewis, belongs to the Seaforth Family.\r\nIt was formerly the property of McLeod of Lewis, now extinct.[267] The\r\nPeople here are Protestants and do not dislike the present Clergy;\r\nthere were two new erections made here, Anno 1726, before the estate\r\nof Seaforth was sold by the Government; so that this country is in a\r\ntolerable state of reformation.\r\n\r\nThe next district of the Long Island is called Harris. The people\r\nProtestants: it belongs to the Laird of McLeod. The next portion\r\nsouthward is called North Uist. The people Protestants; Sir Alexander\r\n[Macdonald] of Slate, Proprietor, South Uist belongs to McDonald of\r\nMoidart, or the Captain of Clanranald, as they call him. The present\r\nClanranald lived here: he and his People are Papists, as is McNeil of\r\nBarra,[268] and his People. In the Uists and Barra are one or two new\r\nerections of late; but by the influence of the Gentry, the diligence\r\nand insolence of the Priests, and the bigotry of the people, the\r\nministers had little success till now. Old Clanranald was not in arms\r\nin the late Rebellion nor could many of his people in Uist get over to\r\nthe Continent, for the ships of war that cruised upon the coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_The Macdonalds_]\r\n\r\nAs I have mentioned two families of the McDonalds, I will say\r\nsomething of them in general. They would be a great Clan and next to\r\nthe Campbells in strength and number, if united under one head: but\r\nthe several families of them, viz.: Clanranald, the Slate family, the\r\nGlengarry family, the Keppoch family, and even the Glencoe family, all\r\npretend to be the lineal heir of McDonald of the Isles, Earl of Ross,\r\nwho was forfeited in the time of James the Second, for joining with\r\nthe Duglases and others in the Great Rebellion that then happened; and\r\nthis division makes them less potent and formidable than otherwise\r\nthey would be.[269] I once made an abstract of the several Rebellions\r\nand Insurrections of the McDonalds against the Kings of Scotland, and\r\nespecially against the Stuart Family; by which it was very evident\r\nthis people was seldom loyal to any King on the throne. If they could\r\nfind no Pretender, they would find some pretence or other for war and\r\nplunder. But this paper I have lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Skye_]\r\n\r\nThe next Island to the South and East is Skye, the property of McDonald\r\nof Slate, McLeod and McInnin,[270] The people Protestants, the Commons\r\nand most of the Gentry better disposed than those in Seaforth’s\r\ncountry, on the opposite continent. Here is a new erection or two made\r\nAnno 1726. Egg, Rum, Muick and Canney, etc., are little Isles adjacent\r\nto Sky; the inhabitants Popish. But about 30 years ago, McLean of Coll\r\nis said to have converted a pragmatical, forward fellow, who misled the\r\nrest, by insulting him in their presence, and on this the inhabitants\r\nof that Island became Protestants.[271] These Isles were erected into a\r\nParish in Anno 1726.[272]\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Glenelg and Knoydart_]\r\n\r\nThe next country southward on the continent is Glenelg, the property of\r\nthe Laird of McLeod. The people Protestants and honest, and generally\r\nwell disposed: here are Barracks built for two or three companies of\r\nsoldiers near the Strait that divides Sky from Glenelg: this country\r\nis fertile in grass and corn. Here are two famous Danish Forts of dry\r\nstone built very high which I have seen.\r\n\r\nTo the south an arm of the sea called Lochiurn, _i.e._, Helsloch[273]\r\nruns up ’twixt this country and Cnoidart. This last is the property\r\nof Glengarry, and the most mountainous, craggy, and coarse of all the\r\nHighlands: the roads are so eminently bad that there is no thought of\r\nriding in it, and in some places so steep and rocky, that they have\r\nropes of withs tied to trees to take hold of, lest passengers should\r\nfall and break their bones. The people all Papists and mostly thieves.\r\n’Tis a part of the parish of Glenelg, but they never give the minister\r\nany trouble, except in collecting his Stipend. Here lived those famous\r\nCadets of Glengarrie’s family, Barisdale, and Scotos,[274] who had\r\nalmost the whole country in bondage, and the people their slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Moidart and Arisaig_]\r\n\r\nTo the south of Knoidart lies Moidart and Arasag, the property of\r\nClanranald. The people Popish but not so thievish as in Knoidart.\r\nNext it lies two great glens called Moroirs; the one of them belongs\r\nto Glengarry and the other to McDonald, commonly called McDonald\r\nof Moroir. The Inhabitants Popish. The two principal Cadets of\r\nthe Clanranald family are Kinloch Moidart and Moroir, and their\r\nbranches,[275] all Popish. These four last countries, viz., Moidart,\r\nArasag and the two Moroirs are in the parish of Ardnamurchan, and\r\nthey with Knoidart are commonly called the Highlands by the other\r\nHighlanders. The people of Lochabyr, Glengarry, and Stratherrick\r\nreckoning their own country level in comparison of these.\r\n\r\nNext lies Ardnamurchan in which is the famous Lead Quarry, Strontian,\r\nthe property of Murray of Stanhope:[276] it belonged till of late to\r\nSir Duncan Campbell of Lochnell: and was taken about the time of the\r\nReformation by Sir Donald Campbell of Ardnamurchan, a natural son to\r\nCalder, from McDonald the old Proprietor. The people are generally\r\nProtestants, but with a mixture of Papists. Many of the inhabitants are\r\nCamerons and McLachlans, and violently Episcopal.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Ardnamurchan, Morvern and Maclean’s Country_]\r\n\r\nAs I am now arrived at the Cape commonly called Ardnamurchan, I turn\r\nback to the north east, where on the Sound of Mull lies the country of\r\nMorven the property of the Duke of Argyle. The people Protestants; many\r\nof them Camerons, McLachlans and McLeans: much inclined to Episcopacy,\r\nand consequently Jacobites. There are few or no Papists: of old this\r\ncountry belonged to the McLean family.\r\n\r\nThe next country on the north east and still on the Sound of Mull is\r\nKingairloch, the property of McLean of Kingairloch. He himself was not\r\nin the Rebellion but I saw two or three of his brothers there. The\r\npeople Episcopal, and Jacobite.\r\n\r\nNext, still north east, and on an arm of the sea lies Ardgour, the\r\nproperty of McLean of Ardgour; his country lies ten or twelve miles\r\nalong the sea-coast till you come to the head of Locheil. He is a\r\nwell disposed old man, but as his estate is much out of his hand, his\r\ninfluence was not great; the people Protestants. Here lived Ludovick\r\nCameron,[277] Uncle to Locheil, who brought out many of the inhabitants\r\nto the Rebellion, especially the Camerons who lived here.\r\n\r\nHaving now travelled on the north side of the Sound of Mull as far\r\nas the sea goes up, the last five miles of which is called Locheil,\r\nI go back to the islands in the Sound, and then will come along the\r\nsouth coast, and describe the countries inhabited by Rebels; I will\r\nafterwards describe the rest of Argyle if you require it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Lismore, Mull, Strathlachlan_]\r\n\r\nThe first island of any note is Lismore; a most fertile soil; all\r\nfounded on Limestone, and like garden ground, which the name of the\r\nisland imports. Here was the seat of the Bishop of the Isles: it lies\r\nin the Sound opposite to Lorn and Appin; the people Protestants and\r\nwell disposed. It is but eight miles long and one broad, and is the\r\nproperty of ten or twelve heritors. To the west hereof lies Mull, a\r\nlarge island containing three Parishes, mostly the Property of the\r\nDuke of Argyle; formerly the property of McLean of Dowart. McLean of\r\nLochbuie has still an estate here, of about 6000 Merks: the people\r\nProtestants mostly and well affected; but from this island, Morvern\r\nand Kingairloch there came about nine score McLeans to the Rebellion,\r\nof whom returned but 38 as a McLean told me.[278] The islands of\r\nTyree, Coll, Jura, Colonsay, Islay, Gigha, etc. I omit as there were\r\nno men from them in the Rebellion. Only before I come to the southeast\r\ncoast of the Sound of Mull, I must not omit a gentleman who rose with\r\nhis men from the heart of the country of Argyle, I mean the Laird of\r\nMcLachlan;[279] his small country called Strathlachlan lies to the\r\nsouth of Inverary and on the south side of Lochfine. He is Chief of the\r\nMcLachlans, and had as I am informed, near 300 men in the Rebellion,\r\nbut of the number I am not quite sure; Mr. Alexr. Campbell, minister\r\nof Inverary, must know.[280] His people of a long time profest to be\r\nof our Communion, but one Mr. John McLachlan,[281] a most violent\r\nEpiscopal minister poisoned his Chief and the gentlemen of his name to\r\na strange degree, and indeed did more mischief among other clans than\r\nany three priests I ever knew.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Appin and Glencoe_]\r\n\r\nI now come as I promised to the coast on the south east side of the\r\nSound of Mull. The first dissaffected country is Appin, inhabited\r\nby the Stuarts. The Laird of Appin[282] keeps quiet at home but the\r\ngentlemen of his clan and his tenants were in the Rebellion. The\r\npeople here are Protestants, but strangely poisoned by the Nonjurant\r\nEpiscopal Clergy. Adjacent to Appin is Glencoe; a small place; McDonald\r\nof Glencoe is Superior.[283] He can raise of his tenants and followers\r\n100 men. He and his people the same as to religion as his neighbours of\r\nAppin.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Lochiel’s Country_]\r\n\r\nTo the north east of Glencoe, an arm of the sea runs up from the Sound\r\nof Mull called [Loch Leven], which I now cross to describe the country\r\nof Mamore, inhabited by Camerons and belonging heritably to the Duke\r\nof Gordon, but a good part of it feued off to Locheil. The people all\r\nProtestants, but of the same kind with Appin and Glencoe. To the north\r\neast of Mamore lies Fort-William and a small Glen called Glennevis,\r\nabove which stands the largest and the highest mountain in Scotland,\r\ncalled Ben Nevis.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the River Lochy lies the rest of Locheil’s estate,\r\nviz., Locheil, Strathlochy, and Locharkaig. The first and second of\r\nthese, six miles long each; the last, twelve miles.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the Loch of Arkaig (the south side being all wood\r\nand desert) mostly inhabited by thieves, the minister of Killmaly\r\npreaches to them once a quarter or twice at most, and then the half of\r\nthem cannot be present if they were willing to attend. In Winter the\r\nsnow and storm hinders, and in Summer they are scattered through the\r\nhills with their cattle. The Camerons boast of their being Protestants,\r\nand Locheil hindered his brother the priest[284] to preach among them,\r\nwhen he told him he would bring them from that villainous habit of\r\nthieving, if he would allow him to preach, and say Mass among them: his\r\nanswer was that the people of Glengarry, Knoidart, Arisag, etc., who\r\nwere profest Papists, were greater thieves than his people, and if he\r\nwould bring these to be honest and industrious, he would then consider\r\nhis proposal as to the Camerons, and till he would bring that good work\r\nto a bearing he positively forbad him to middle with his people. But\r\nLocheil and the gentlemen of his clan were great encouragers of the\r\nNonjurants and as far as they could they perverted the Commons.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Keppoch_]\r\n\r\nThe South of the River Lochy is the property of the Duke of Gordon for\r\n6 miles benorth Fort William: inhabited mostly by Camerons. And then\r\nbegins the country of McDonald of Keppoch, partly the property of the\r\nDuke of Gordon; and partly the Laird of M‘Intoshes, Keppoch having but\r\na small interest in it. Anno 1687 McIntosh wanting a great arrear of\r\nrents of Keppoch, and getting no satisfaction, went to that country to\r\npoynd their cattle, and brought in his train above 500 men. Keppoch,\r\nwith the assistance of Glencoe and others, his good friends, paid him\r\nhis rents by giving him battle,[285] killing great numbers of his men,\r\nand taking himself prisoner, and getting such good conditions as he\r\npleased before he released him. The whole ended in a famous Highland\r\nsong, mocking McIntosh, and placing the true property of the country\r\nin Keppoch, as worthier to possess it. Next year Keppoch and his men\r\ncame northward within 4 miles of Inverness, and sent a message to that\r\ntown, to find him and his men, money, clothes, and provisions; with a\r\nthreatening if they scrupled this, he would plunder the town. The town\r\nsent out three or four of their Top Burghers to commune with him. These\r\nhe detained close prisoners, and sent another message demanding 4000\r\nMerks in Specie, and a suit of their finest scarlet mounted with gold\r\nfor himself with a certification that if this was not done next day,\r\nwhich happened to be the Sabbath, he would hang up their ambassadors,\r\nand then plunder their town. Accordingly the town redeemed themselves\r\nat the rate he was pleased to prescribe, and his fine and rich suit was\r\nfinished on Sunday. Then the Ambassadors were released after a severe\r\nreprimand for their insolence in prescribing anything to him further\r\nthan to ask his pleasure.\r\n\r\nKeppoch’s people and the Duke of Gordon’s tenants in the neighbourhood\r\nare mostly Popish;[286] the greatest number of them were perverted in\r\nthe Reigns of Queen Anne and George the first. They deal pretty deep in\r\nthe thieving trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Glengarry_]\r\n\r\nThe next country to the north east is Glengarry, the people Papists and\r\nbetter at thieving than the worst of the other tribes. Their gentlemen\r\nfound a way to put most of their neighbours under Black Mail which\r\nraised them some hundreds of pounds Sterling, for several years back.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Abertarff and Stratherrick_]\r\n\r\nThe next country still eastward is Abertarff, mostly the property\r\nof the Lovat Family: some of it feued out to Glengarry: all betwixt\r\nFort Augustus are Popish: the few villages of Abertarf, be-east the\r\nGarrison, are inhabited by a mixture of Papists and Protestants: the\r\npeople not free from theft.\r\n\r\nHere lies Lochness, the country on the South side is called\r\nStratherrick the property of the Lovat Family. The people Protestants:\r\nthey submitted to the Established Clergy for many years back. The\r\nCommons went to the late Rebellion with great reluctance, and most\r\nof them violently compelled. The first country on the north side\r\nof the lake is called Glen Morrison, the property of Grant of Glen\r\nMorrison.[287] The old man with his men were in the Rebellion: the\r\nyoung Laird is an Ensign in Lord John Murray’s Regiment.[288] The\r\npeople a mixture of Papists and Protestants, much given to theft.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Urquhart and Glenmoriston_]\r\n\r\nForward to the north east is the country of Urquhart, belonging to the\r\nLaird of Grant. Their neighbours, the McDonalds and Frasers, raised\r\nmost of the men and carried them off to the Rebellion.[289] These and\r\nthe Glen Morrison men after the Battle of Culloden surrendered to the\r\nyoung Laird of Grant, and were brought by him to the Duke of Cumberland\r\nto Inverness to deliver their arms; but by some mistake in the Report,\r\nas if they were taken in arms rather than surrendered, they were made\r\nprisoners and sent off by sea to England. The people are Protestants,\r\nthough none of the most civilized.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_The Aird_]\r\n\r\nNext is the country of the Aird belonging to Lord Lovat, and where his\r\nhouse stood. The people Protestants, and of our Communion, save very\r\nfew.[290] The Commons here are an honest, civilized sort of people if\r\nleft to themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Strathglass_]\r\n\r\nNext, to the North, is the country of Strathglass, mostly inhabited by\r\nPapists. I do not hear much of their thieving, though they suffer much\r\nby the Glengarry thieves. This country belongs mostly to Chisholm of\r\nComar (whose men were in the Rebellion, though he himself was not)[291]\r\nand partly to the Frasers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Seaforth, Munro, and Cromartie’s Country_]\r\n\r\nNext is Seaforth’s country, all along pretty low and level, till you\r\ncome to Ferrindonall, the country of the Munro’s; (the Highland part\r\nof his estate, I described on the first sheet as it lies on the North\r\nSea). The Gentlemen and Commons of the McKenzies are Protestants save\r\nvery few, but very much devoted to the Nonjurant Episcopal Clergy. The\r\nSeaforth family embraced the Reformation in the Minority of James the\r\nsixth. Coline, then Earl, entertained the famous Mr. Robert Bruce[292]\r\nat his house with great respect and esteem when he was banished to\r\nInverness and the country beyond it. I saw the subscription of Earl\r\nGeorge, brother to the said Colin, to an original copy of the Covenant\r\ningrossed on parchment, but he was afterward excommunicated by the\r\nChurch for breach of trust. I am not sure if this family turned Popish\r\nbefore James the seventh’s time, but the then Earl, whose name was\r\nKenneth, was Popish, as was his son the late Earl. The present Earl was\r\nvery faithful to the Government all the time of the Rebellion.[293] The\r\nMunros and Rosses, I say nothing of, as their good affection to Church\r\nand State is well known.\r\n\r\nNext is the Earl of Cromartie’s Estate. In the low country the people\r\nwell affected to our Constitution in Church and State; and very few of\r\nhis Low Country tenants went with their Lord to the Rebellion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Mackintosh Country_]\r\n\r\nHaving in the first sheet described all be-north the broad Ferry of\r\nSutherland at which I have arrived, I come to McIntoshes country,\r\nviz., Strathnairn, Strathdearn,[294] and Badenoch. The people are all\r\nProtestants, not given to thieving, but strangely poisoned by the\r\nNonjurant Clergy. Their dissatisfaction has sufficiently appeared by\r\ntheir rising with the Lady against the King, rather than with the\r\nLaird, their Chief who was a captain in the King’s pay, yea, McIntoshes\r\nown company, which he had newly levied, deserted from him and listed in\r\nwhat was called the Lady’s Regiment.[295]\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Strathspey, Strathavon and Glenlivat_]\r\n\r\nThe next country, Strathspey, the property and seat of the Laird of\r\nGrant: this Clan raised a Regiment at the Revolution and were firm\r\nto the interest of King William, but they suffered so much by the\r\ndepredations of the Camerons and McDonalds that they became rather too\r\ncautious in time of the late Rebellion; the truth is they were ’twixt\r\ntwo fires, Lord Lewis Gordon to the east, and McIntoshes, Camerons\r\nand MacDonalds to the west, so that their country must have been\r\nseverely plundered if they had been more than Neuters.[296] Besides\r\nthe emulation ’twixt Grant and the President in former Elections for a\r\nmember of Parliament was said to have made the Grants too [cautious];\r\nhowever their good affection to the Revolution Interest has not been\r\nquestioned, and they are firm Presbyterians. Theft is scarcely known\r\nin this country, though they have been great sufferers by the thieving\r\nclans to the West.\r\n\r\nTo the east of Strathspey is Strathdown[297] and Glenlivat mostly\r\nthe property of the Duke of Gordon: the people mostly Popish, also\r\nthe Enzie and Strathbogy, a mixture of Papists and Protestants. From\r\nthese countries Lord Lewis recruited the most of his men, and in their\r\nneighbourhood is Braemar and Cromar the country of the Farquharsons:\r\nthe people Protestants, with a small mixture of Papists: the Gentlemen\r\nmuch devoted to the Nonjurant Clergy. I am not particularly acquainted\r\nwith this country; therefore, though it be large and populous, I say\r\nlittle about it.\r\n\r\nI can say little of the country of Angus and Mearns, only I know\r\ndissaffection prevails there: nor am I much known to the country\r\nof the Duke of Atholl; the Stuarts and Robisons there are bigoted\r\nJacobites, as are some of the Murrays. And as little do I know of the\r\nDrummonds and McGregors, but their Dissaffection is _Notour_. Therefore\r\nI conclude this paper with two lists as near as I can guess of the\r\nstrength of the Dissaffected, and Well affected Clans in the Highlands\r\nand North Country. Which Lists you have in another sheet of this date.\r\n\r\n    [_Caetera desunt_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE LATE REBELLION FROM ROSS AND SUTHERLAND WRITTEN BY\r\nDANIEL MUNRO MINISTER OF TAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had notice in this country of the Young Pretender’s arrival\r\nin Lochaber, about the middle of August 1745. The friends of the\r\nGovernment generally despised the Attempt, and the Jacobite party\r\nshowed then no open disposition to join him. It is said the first\r\nnotice of his arrival was sent by the Laird of McLeod to the Lord\r\nPresident,[298] and that the President wrote insolently to Locheil\r\n(at whose house the Young Pretender was said to be, dissuading him\r\nfrom a Rising to Rebellion). Locheil was under great obligation to the\r\nPresident, on account of the President’s endeavours to get him reponed\r\nto his estate, which had been forfeited in the year 1715. The return\r\nLocheil made was, that he had been long in search of an important paper\r\nrelating to that affair, which he now sent him enclosed: this is all he\r\nwrote, and the paper enclosed was the Pretender’s Declaration.\r\n\r\nThe first Rising in this Country was under the Earl of Cromartie, the\r\nEarl had waited on Sir John Cope at Inverness with others: he professed\r\na steady adherence to the Government, for though he had been bred a\r\nJacobite, yet he married young into a Whig family.[299] He had a post\r\nand pension of the Government, and was universally thought a Government\r\nMan in grant of interest, and was so looked upon in point of Principle,\r\nhaving so often qualified to the Government. He and family joining the\r\nEstablished Church and having educated his eldest son in Revolution\r\nPrinciples.\r\n\r\nThe first step he took towards joining the Rebels (though it was not\r\nso construed at the time) was declining to accept of a Commission\r\nfor his son Lord McLeod[300] to be Captain of one of the independent\r\ncompanies, offered him by the Lord President. He pretended for so doing\r\na disobligement, being refused by the President the nomination of the\r\nSubalterns of said companie. After this he was observed to associate\r\nwith Lord Lovat, and in the meantime Lord McLeod, his eldest son,\r\nrepaired to the Highlands of Lochbroom and Cogach, where his Lordship\r\nhas a considerable estate, vassalage, and superiority, being Heritable\r\nSherriff. Lord McLeod raised the men there; but it was yet pretended\r\nthis rising was for the defence of his house and person, as Lord Lovat\r\nhad raised his people and kept them about him under the same pretext.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Battle of Preston, McDonald of Barisdale[301] came to\r\nthis country and was with my Lord openly at his house at Newtarbet,\r\nwhich gave the first rise to any suspicion about the Earl, especially\r\nas there was such preparation, as the making of Highland clothes,\r\nproviding of Arms, and ammunition: but to cover this, it was pretended\r\nhis Lordship intended a journey to Edinburgh, and must have a strong\r\nguard. However early in November he openly declared himself, and went\r\nfrom his house at Newtarbet to West Ross, where a part of his estate\r\nlies, and was joined by his son Lord McLeod, with twixt two and three\r\nhundred of his men, taken from Lochbroom and Cogach and off his Estate\r\nin West Ross, having got none to follow him from his estate about\r\nNewtarbet which is in East Ross, but about ten men who were his menial\r\nservants and a young gentleman Roderick McCulloch of Glastalich,[302]\r\none of his vassals, and whose family and friends had no connection with\r\nJacobitism, and whom it is generally allowed the Earl decoyed into the\r\nRebellion. He then marched to the Lord Lovat’s house, where he was\r\njoined by the master of Lovat, with 300 Frasers and both went to Perth.\r\n\r\nUpon the Rebels coming North after their retreat from Stirling and\r\ntheir arrival at Inverness, they were joined by the whole Posse of\r\nthe Frasers, who were formed into three Regiments under the command\r\nof the Master of Lovat,[303] Fraser younger of Inverallachie,[304]\r\nand Fraser of Foyers;[305] by the Chisholms,[306] all of them under\r\nthe command of two younger sons of their chief[307] the Chisholm of\r\nStrathglass; by considerable numbers of the McKenzies reckoned about\r\n400, besides the Earl of Cromartie’s own Regiment. These McKenzies\r\nwere of the Estates of Redcastle, Culcoy, Lentron, Applecross, Coul,\r\nFairburn, Gairloch, Balmaduthy and Allangrange. Under the leading of\r\nMcKenzie of Lentron, a younger brother to McKenzie of Fairburn[308] and\r\na brother to McKenzie of Culcoy formed into a regiment under McDonald\r\nof Barasdale with some of the Banditti Highlanders formerly with him.\r\nThe Earl of Cromartie when Commander in Chief benorth Beullie affected\r\nto be chief of the McKenzies. It is certain the men of the above estate\r\nwere actually in arms under him and I am well assured he threatened\r\nMilitary Execution against McKenzie of Scatwell (a loyal family of that\r\nname) if he did not give his men also, which he absolutely refused at\r\nall hazards, and reckons himself happy his Lordship did not return\r\nwith the same power from Sutherland. It is also fact that when the\r\nRebels were exacting Cess and Levy money of all the estates of the\r\ngentlemen in Ross in the most vigorous manner, the gentlemen of the\r\nname of McKenzie whose men were in arms were excused from paying their\r\nproportion of Levy money. The Rebels were joined by the McIntoshes\r\nwho had not joined formerly, by the McIlivraes and McBeans under the\r\ncommand of McIlivrae of Dunmaglass,[309] commonly called the Ladie\r\nMcIntoshes Regiment,[310] as she was known to be extremely active in\r\nraising them:[311] there were also a mixt multitude from Aberdeen\r\nand Banffshire under the command of Lord Lewis Gordon and Mr. More of\r\nStonnywood.\r\n\r\nThe arts and methods by which the Jacobites endeavoured to raise\r\nand spirit people into the Rebellion, and by which they were too\r\nsuccessful, were the spreading all sorts of false news to the\r\nadvantage of their own cause and party; particularly such as related\r\nto a French landing, and a junction in England; the venting gross\r\nmisrepresentations and slanders against the King, Royal Family and\r\nAdministration; pretending intolerable grievances and confident\r\npromises of relief from them: but above all, the indefeasible right of\r\nthe family of Stuarts, the native interest all Scots men had in them,\r\nwith the Pretender’s Declaration, were most commonly insisted upon, and\r\nthis was done with all possible zeal and address, by those Jacobites of\r\npower and station who did not think it safe to risk their persons or\r\nestates in the cause; though their brothers or sons or other relations\r\nand tenants had joined openly. In this view we have been told the\r\nRebellion was a well conducted scheme not like that in the 1715; when\r\nall the Jacobite Grandees took the field, but now when their common\r\nmen were only exposed, though the attempt should not succeed the same\r\nJacobite interest would still subsist.\r\n\r\nAs to characters all above mentioned whose relations or tenants had\r\njoined were regular Jacobites, the Earl of Cromartie, Lord McLeod and\r\nthe Master of Lovat excepted.\r\n\r\nAs to the well affected: Mr. Harry Munro Younger of Foulis now Sir\r\nHarry who had been newly nominated a Captain in the Lord Loudon’s\r\nRegiment having speedily raised a company of Munroes to serve in\r\nthe said Regiment met Sir John Cope at the Water of Nairn and upon\r\ntheir arrival at Inverness, Capt. George Munro of Culkairn,[312] Sir\r\nHarry’s Uncle, waited on them, where it was concerted that the Munroes\r\nshould instantly take arms and join the King’s Troops, which was done\r\naccordingly. Three Companies were raised under the Leading of Culkairn,\r\nHugh Munro of Teaninich and William Munro of Achany, and marched with\r\nGeneral Cope as his advanced guard to Aberdeen, where they stayed till\r\nthe Army took shipping. Sir Harrie and his company went along and were\r\nat the Battle of Preston where they were taken prisoners with the other\r\nHighland Companies there. At the same time Captain Alexander M‘Cay, son\r\nto Lord Reay and Captain in Lord Loudon’s Regiment, raised a company\r\nof McCays in Strathnavar and upon notice of General Cope’s arrival\r\nat Inverness marched speedily to join him and missing the General at\r\nInverness followed him and being informed that Gordon of Glenbucket\r\nwas in arms for the Pretender, took boat upon the Murray Coast and\r\ncame up with the General at Aberdeen, was at the Battle of Preston and\r\ntaken prisoner, none of his men or the Monroes when prisoners would be\r\nprevailed upon to enlist for the Pretender.[313]\r\n\r\nCulkairn upon his march homeward from Aberdeen was apprised by a friend\r\nfrom Banff that Glenbucket with 400 men waited to intercept him. He\r\nmade his best preparation and resolutely went on; when Glenbucket\r\nthought proper to withdraw, which must have been owing to the known\r\nbravery of Culkairn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord Loudon and the President_\r\n\r\nImmediately after the Battle of Preston, the Earl of Loudon took post\r\nfor London, and without loss of time came down in a King’s Sloop to\r\nInverness, where he took upon him the Command for the North, and\r\nacted always thereafter in concert with the President. The President\r\ndisposed of the independent companies for raising of which he had blank\r\ncommissions, in the following manner: A company to Captain Munro of\r\nCulkairn, two companies to the Earl of Sutherland, two to my Lord Reay,\r\nfour companies to the Laird of McLeod, one company to Hugh McLeod of\r\nGuineas, four companies to Sir Alexander McDonald whereof only two came\r\nto Inverness, a company of Grants, two companies to the Lord Fortrose,\r\na company to the Master of Ross, and a company from Inverness,\r\ncommanded by Mr. McIntosh, late baillie here. The Munroes, Sutherlands,\r\nMcCays, and McLeods came to Inverness upon the first call: there was\r\ndifficulty in raising the McKenzie companies, though Lord Fortrose[314]\r\nexerted himself all he could to get it done and showed abundance of\r\nzeal for the Government. The best service he was able to do was\r\npreventing a more general rising of his numerous Clan, in which he was\r\nsuccessful, there being only about 700 of them in Rebellion including\r\nCromartie’s Regiment. The Clan will at least amount to 1500.\r\n\r\nAs the Master of Ross was not in the country, the Laird of Inverchasley\r\nbestirred himself much to raise a company of Rosses for the Master,\r\nand a company of the Highlanders of the name of Ross were accordingly\r\nraised; but Malcolm Ross, younger of Pitcalnie,[315] Ensign in Sir\r\nHarrie Munroe’s Company of Loudon’s Regiment, and who had been taken\r\nprisoner at the Battle of Preston, having come to the country upon\r\npretence of being on his parole, but in reality to serve the Rebel\r\ninterest, as sufficiently appeared afterwards, got the said company\r\ndismissed in the following manner. Mr. Bailey, factor to the Lord Ross\r\nin this country, ordered the company to attend at his house at Ardmore,\r\nin order to be received by Mr. Ross of Inverchasley and others. The\r\nnight before the Day of the Review the said Pitcalnie lodged at the\r\nhouse of Mr. Baillie (Mr. Baillie not being in the knowledge of his\r\ndesign) and when the men appeared ready for the intended Review, Mr.\r\nRoss younger, of Pitcalnie, ordered them to follow him, which they did,\r\nand he lead them back to the Highlands. Mr. Ross of Inverchasley coming\r\nup soon thereafter, and joined by Mr. Baillie went after them and\r\nhaving come up with them, very seriously expostulated with Pitcalnie\r\nfor his conduct, and dealt earnestly with the men to return, and engage\r\nin the intended service for the Government; which Pitcalnie refused\r\nand the men also at that time (but they absolutely declined entering\r\nto the Rebellion and when the Master of Ross came to the Country they\r\nappeared for the Government), upon which Pitcalnie repaired to Lord\r\nLovat’s, openly joined the Rebels attended only by his servant, after\r\nthe President who is his grand uncle had been at the utmost pains to\r\nreclaim him. He was debauched with the hopes of being made Laird of\r\nBalnagowan, nor were his family formerly tainted with Jacobitism.\r\n\r\nThe President’s house of Culloden was attacked in October by a body\r\nof Frasers, commanded by Fraser of Foyers, to the number of about 150\r\nin the night time: they were repulsed and one of their number found\r\nwounded in an adjacent wood next day, who was brought to the President;\r\nand upon examination he discovered who were of the party. After which\r\nthe President ordered him to be carried to Inverness to be cared for by\r\na surgeon, gave him a piece of money and liberty after his cure to go\r\nwhere he had a mind. Some time thereafter the Earl of Loudon marched\r\nfrom Inverness with a body of 800 men, and apprehended Lord Lovat at\r\nhis house of Castledownie and carried him prisoner to Inverness, where\r\nhe was kept under a guard in a private house and in a few days found\r\nmeans to make his escape.\r\n\r\nMy Lord Loudon by the junction of the independent companies and the\r\nremains of his own Regiment, made up a body of about 2000 men at\r\nInverness. Lord Lewis Gordon, who had been an officer in the Fleet,\r\nwas at the same time very active in raising men for the Pretender in\r\nAberdeen and Banffshire, and the Earl of Loudon being informed by\r\nintelligence from Aberdeen, and called upon by the friends of the\r\nGovernment there, ordered seven of the Independent Companies, viz., the\r\nfour McLeod Companies commanded by the Laird of McLeod in person, the\r\nMunro and Inverness Companies, and that commanded by Captain McLeod of\r\nGuineas;[316] who accordingly marched for Aberdeen and were joined by\r\n400 Grants at the Water of Spey who marched with them to Strathbogie\r\n18 miles from Spey; where they again left them, and returned to their\r\nown country. The Companies continued their march for Aberdeen, and\r\nhaving upon the [23rd] day of December come to Inverury within 10\r\nmiles of Aboin, they were attacked in the night by Lord Lewis Gordon\r\nand his party, who had been reinforced by some companies of Lord John\r\nDrummond’s French Regiment sent for that end from the North. The\r\nattack was sustained by the Laird of McLeod and Culkairn with great\r\nbravery, who finding the superior number of the enemies, and then first\r\nobserving the French Reinforcement they had got, ordered a retreat,\r\nwhich was managed with good advantage, having only seven private men\r\nkilled and a few taken prisoners, among whom was Mr. Gordon younger of\r\nArdoch, Culkairn’s Lieutenant. There was considerable execution done\r\nupon the Rebels as our men had the favour of the houses, garden dykes,\r\netc., and the Rebels made no pursuit.[317]\r\n\r\nThe Master of Ross, having come by sea to Inverness, was joyfully\r\nreceived by the loyal Clan of the Rosses, when he immediately repaired\r\nto this country with the concurrence of the gentlemen of his name,\r\nparticularly the Laird of Inverchasley, he raised an independent\r\nCompany with which he joined Lord Loudon.\r\n\r\nUpon the Young Pretender’s retreat Northward, Lord Loudon being\r\ninformed of his being at the House of Moy, the Laird of McIntosh’s\r\nseat, within 8 miles of Inverness, he marched from Inverness in the\r\ndead of the night with about 1200 men with a view to surprise the\r\nPretender, but as to the particulars of this attempt and how it came to\r\nmiscarry, it is referred to a more particular information.[318]\r\n\r\nThe Rebels being upon their march to Inverness both those who came the\r\nlow way by Aberdeen and those who came by the Highland Road with the\r\nYoung Pretender; the Earl of Loudon furnished the Castle of Inverness,\r\nwhich Major Grant commanded,[319] with a company of Red Coats, with\r\nstores of provisions, and added two independent Companies, the Grants\r\nand that commanded by the Master of Ross, and by the defences he made\r\nabout the town he seemed disposed to maintain Inverness against the\r\nRebels: but upon their approach and considering their numbers and that\r\nthe place was not tenable, he made a well conducted retreat over the\r\nFerry of Kissack towards Ross-shire. When the retreat was a-making the\r\nRebels carried a field piece to the shore below Inverness and having\r\nplanted it upon a rising ground within flood mark, they discharged\r\nit several times, at the Boats on their passage, without doing any\r\nexecution, though the bullets lighted very near the Boats, particularly\r\nthat in which was Lord Loudon which was the last that passed, and one\r\nof them among the men drawn up on the other side after their landing.\r\n\r\nThe Rebels immediately took possession of Inverness, and laid siege\r\nto the Castle, which was surrendered the third day; but as to the\r\nparticulars of this sort of siege you are referred to the proceeding of\r\nthe Court Martial which condemned and cashiered the Governor.\r\n\r\nBefore Lord Loudon left Inverness, and upon the approach of the Rebels,\r\nhe called upon the Lord Sutherland, Lord Reay and the Master of Ross,\r\nto get up to Inverness all the men they could make. Whereupon my Lord\r\nSutherland marched in person at the head of 400 men. The Master having\r\ncalled upon the Laird of Inverchasley and his other friends, four\r\ncompanies of Rosses were ready and upon their march to Inverness their\r\nadvanced party met Loudon immediately as he landed in Ross. They were\r\nastonished to find the Master of Ross their leader had been pent up in\r\nthe Castle of Inverness, however they waited Lord Loudon his orders:\r\nsome of them he advised home, to others he gave arms and pay, and they\r\nwere with him in Sutherland. My Lord Sutherland by Loudon’s orders\r\nretreated to his own country, his four hundred men last mentioned,\r\ncontinued under arms. The McCays, by reason of the distance of their\r\ncountry, would not come up with Lord Loudon, till they found him\r\nretreated to Sutherland where they joined him.\r\n\r\nThe day after Loudon’s retreat from Inverness, he marched down\r\nfrom East Ross where he continued for three or four days: and upon\r\nintelligence that a strong body of the Rebels under the Earl of\r\nCromartie, Commander in chief benorth Beully had come to West Ross\r\nand were upon their way to attack him. He with the Lord President and\r\nseveral gentlemen who had taken flight from Murray to Ross, and all\r\nthe men under his command (excepting the two McKenzie Companies who\r\ndispersed themselves immediately after the retreat from Inverness\r\nand not one of them having followed him) he retreated to Sutherland\r\nwith a resolution to guard the Passes to that country against the\r\nRebels. Several gentlemen of this country, particularly Inverchasley\r\nand ministers who had been so active in raising men to join Loudon,\r\nthought fit to repair at the same time to Sutherland. Lord Fortrose\r\nleft his troup at Brahan and took flight to the Highlands of his own\r\ncountry,[320] where he remained with a body of his men about him till\r\nafter the Battle of Culloden.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Loudon when he got into Sutherland posted his men along the\r\nFirth of Tain which divides Sutherland from Ross: from Dornoch to Lairg\r\nthe difference of ten miles.\r\n\r\nThe remains of Loudon’s Regiment being about 200 were posted at\r\nDornoch: the McCays being 300 at the Muckle Ferry, three miles above\r\nDornoch: the two McDonald Companies at Pulrossie, a mile above the\r\nFerry: the Inverness Company at Spengadale, two miles above the\r\nMcDonalds: the Munroes at Criech, two miles above Spengadale: McLeod\r\nof Guineas his Company at the Bonar, a mile above Criech: the Laird of\r\nMcLeod with his 400 men at the Pass of Invershin, three miles above the\r\nBonar; and the Sutherlands to the number of 600 at Lairg and thereabout.\r\n\r\n    TAYNE, _Feb. 13, 1747_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMOIRS OF THE REBELLION IN 1745 AND 1746, SO FAR AS IT CONCERNED THE\r\nCOUNTIES OF ABERDEEN AND BANFF\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gordon of Glenbucket rises_\r\n\r\nThe first man in these countys that rose in this rebellion, was John\r\nGordon, Elder of Glenbucket. Immediately on the Young Pretender’s\r\nlanding, he went to the Highlands to meet him and returned directly\r\nwith a Commission as Major-General and some money to raise men, and he\r\nsoon got together about 300 mostly from Strathdawn[321] and Glenlivet\r\nand some too from Strathboggy, all parts of the Duke of Gordon’s Estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Is assisted by Skeleter in Strathdon_\r\n\r\nHis son-in-law, Mr. Forbes of Skeleter,[322] also brought him some of\r\nthis Corps from Strathdon, a country belonging mostly to gentlemen\r\nof that name, formerly vassals of the Earl of Mar, now of the Lord\r\nBraco.[323] In consequence of this vassalage most of this country had\r\nbeen engaged in the Rebellion in the 1715, and formed a very good body\r\nof men, and as their new Superior, Lord Braco, had not yet acquired\r\ngreat authority over them and Mr. Forbes of New (a family all along\r\nwell affected to the Government)[324] was abroad, being an officer in\r\nthe army, the Rebels flattered themselves that by Skeleter’s means the\r\nrising at this time would be no less considerable; but in this they\r\nwere greatly disappointed. For Mr. Leith of Glenkindy, who had lately\r\ncome to that neighbourhood, being a very firm friend of the Government,\r\nand Mr. Forbes of Inverernan (whose predecessor in the 1715 was known\r\nby the name of Black Jock) much contrary to the Rebels’ expectation,\r\ndeclaring the same way; and Mr. Lumsden, minister of Towey, who had\r\na small estate in that country, managing the whole with a great deal\r\nof address, as he was entirely well-acquainted with all their tempers\r\nand situations, Skeleter found his measures so effectually traversed,\r\nthat he had difficulty enough in raising his own Tenants. Mr. Gordon\r\nof Avochy, Glenbucket’s Nephew, a very resolute, active lad, assisted\r\nhim considerably in his Levys about Strathboggy, where he had a small\r\nestate. He, Glenbucket, had also two sons joined him, but the eldest\r\nhaving drunk himself blind could not attempt to march along and was of\r\nlittle use to him at home: the other, too, was but an insignificant\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\nGlenbucket was at Strathboggy when General Cope came to Aberdeen,[325]\r\nwhere the Jacobites gave out that his numbers were at least triple\r\nof what they were in reality, and there was so great apprehension of\r\nhis surprizing the town, and the Magazines there, provided for the\r\nArmy, that the General thought proper to order most of his Highland\r\ncompanies to march from Old Meldrum in the midst of the night and\r\ntake possession of Aberdeen. Why General Cope was so many days at\r\nAberdeen before he embarked, why he refused the most expeditious way\r\nof embarking his troops which was proposed by the Magistrates, of\r\nbringing about their Fish Boats from John’s Haven, and as well as\r\nusing the Torry and Foothy[326] boats which would have gained him a\r\nday at least (as the Transports when the Soldiers came not out to them\r\nin boats, behoved to come up to the harbour with one tide, and go out\r\nwith another) let those that know the reasons, give them. Meantime\r\nhis dallying gave several of his men an opportunity of deserting to\r\nStrathboggy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Glenbucket declines Fighting the Munroes_\r\n\r\nWhen the 200 Munroes under Culkairn who had accompanied General Cope\r\nto Aberdeen were returning from thence, there were great apprehensions\r\nlest Glenbucket, who was superior to them in numbers, should have\r\nintercepted them and cut them off; but Culkairn himself was under no\r\ndread, as his men were good and better armed than Glenbucket’s, and\r\ntherefore marched on very briskly the way of Banff. Glenbucket had gone\r\ndown to that country on an expedition for horses and arms, and was in\r\nBanff that very day the Monroes came there, but, not choosing to wait\r\ntheir coming up, he sheered off the way to Strathboggy.\r\n\r\nSoon after this he had a call from the Young Pretender to hasten up,\r\nand accordingly marched South, keeping the westerly roads, and not\r\ncoming near the towns of Aberdeen or the low parts of the country, but\r\ndid not join the main Army of the Rebels, till after the Battle of\r\nPreston.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Glenbucket’s Character_\r\n\r\nGlenbucket was a man very singular in his way, and is perhaps the only\r\ninstance of a Gentleman of a low country family and education, that\r\nboth could and would so thoroughly conform himself to the Highland\r\nSpirit and manners, as to be able to procure a following among them\r\nwithout a Highland estate or any of the attachments of Chieftainry. He\r\nalways discovered a great deal of personal courage and particularly\r\nbehaved well in the 1715 when he commanded some men raised by the\r\nDuke of Gordon, in that Rebellion, and after that time kept up a\r\ngreat intercourse with the Highland Chiefs, which was much increased\r\nby the marriage of one of his daughters to one of them, McDonald of\r\nGlengarry, and it is generally believed he was very serviceable to the\r\ncourt of Rome, in keeping up their correspondence with the Chiefs of\r\nthe Clans, and was certainly once and again of late years over at that\r\ncourt, when his Low Country friends believed him to be all the while\r\nin the Highlands. He had sold the estate of Glenbucket, from whence\r\nhe has his designation, a good while ago, and at the breaking out of\r\nthis Rebellion, had not a foot of property, and yet those creatures\r\nin Strathdawn and Glenlivet were so attached to him that a number of\r\nthem rose voluntarily with him. He was however by this time so old and\r\ninfirm that he could not mount his horse, but behoved to be lifted into\r\nhis saddle, notwithstanding of which the old spirit still remained in\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n_More of Stonnywood_\r\n\r\nVery soon after the Young Pretender landed, More of Stonnywood[327]\r\nprepared to join him, at first very privately, as his estate lay\r\nwithin three miles of Aberdeen, where all in appearance was for the\r\nGovernment. This gentleman very early imbibed the Jacobite principles\r\nand was entirely educated in that way; his fortune also was greatly\r\nembarrassed, so that his going off was no great surprise. He was a\r\nman of little note or interest and of no great genius, but yet by his\r\nactivity, diligence, and application, and his thorough acquaintance\r\nwith the circumstances of Town and Country, he was very serviceable to\r\nthe Rebels in those parts. He slipped away at first alone, and came\r\nup with his Pretended Prince, as he was about to enter Edinburgh,\r\nand having immediately got a Commission to raise men, he left them\r\nbefore the Battle of Preston, and had the assurance to enter the\r\ntown of Aberdeen supported by a couple of broken merchants and York\r\nStreet Cadys[328] all in white cockades, and to enlist men for the\r\nPretender. The well affected people in town seemed only to make a\r\njest of Stonnywood and his procession, and the magistrates found it\r\nconvenient to overlook it, since any ill-usage of him might have been\r\nseverly revenged by a very small party, for as Cope had carried off the\r\nTown’s Arms lest the Rebels should have seized them, a very few armed\r\nmen might have come and plundered the whole town; but from this small\r\nbeginning thus neglected, the Rebels very soon became masters of the\r\nplace in reality and so continued till the army arrived under His Royal\r\nHighness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Farquharson of Monaltry rises at the head of Dea_\r\n\r\nMuch about the same time Mr. Farquharson of Monaltry,[329] age 35,\r\na gentleman of no great estate, Nephew and factor to the Laird of\r\nInvercauld, began to move at the head of Dea. This gentleman was\r\neducated in Revolution principles, but was unhappily seduced and\r\ndebauched into the Jacobite scheme by the Duke of Perth, who both\r\nthe times that he was obliged to conceal himself from the Government\r\nmade that country his retreat,[330] and Mr. Farquharson, being a\r\nsweet-tempered, agreeable lad, was his chief companion in his exile.\r\nAs Invercauld gave Monaltry no countenance in his rebellion, but\r\nimmediately turned him out of his Factory, he was not at first very\r\nsuccessful in his levys, but as Farquharson of Balmurral,[331] Gordon\r\nof Blelack and some others, all of small estates, rose some time after\r\nfrom that country, there were at length a good many men brought from\r\nthence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hamilton and Tulloch in Strathboggy_\r\n\r\nJohn Hamilton, Factor to the Duke of Gordon for the lands about\r\nStrathboggy, and afterwards Governor of Carlisle,[332] resolved also\r\nvery early to join this Rebellion, and being a very haughty man would\r\nnot act under Glenbucket, but set up on his own footing, and this\r\nstopped both their progress for a while, as their misunderstanding made\r\nthem counteract one another. However Hamilton, being much assisted\r\nby one David Tulloch, a considerable tenant of the Duke’s,[333] soon\r\ngot together 100 Men, thirty of whom he mounted on gentlemen’s horses\r\nwhich he seized through the County. Hamilton undoubtedly was a noted\r\nJacobite, but reckoned too selfish to meddle in such undertakings, so\r\nthat the reason of his commencing adventurer was generally imagined\r\nto be owing to the disorder of his affairs, which indeed was not\r\napprehended till this step brought it to light. He marched from\r\nStrathboggy to Inverury the Monday after the Battle of Preston, where\r\nhe obliged the Magistrates to attend while the Pretender’s Manifesto\r\nwas being read over the Cross, and next day using the same ceremony as\r\nhe marched through Kintore, he came to Aberdeen just as the Council\r\nwere about electing their Magistrates, which he immediately stopped\r\nunless they’d take their oaths to the Pretender (so that the Town\r\nwanted Magistrates all the time of the Rebellion), and forced the\r\nthen Provost and some of the Bailies to attend the reading of their\r\nManifestos over the Cross which was done by Sheriff Depute Petry,[334]\r\nhe pretending at that time to be forced to it, though he afterwards\r\njoined them openly, and then when the Provost refused to join in their\r\ndisloyal healths Hamilton poured a glass of wine down his throat, and\r\nall along behaved very insolently, but happily for Aberdeen he soon\r\nmarched south with his corps.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord Pitsligo moves in Buchan_\r\n\r\nThe unhappy Battle of Preston soon put several in motion who till\r\nthen were quiet. The Lord Pitsligo[335] who had also been engaged in\r\nthe Rebellion in the 1715, and had received both his life and fortune\r\nfrom the Government, still retained his old affection for that cause,\r\nand never qualified to the present Government. He was justly esteemed\r\na polite and learned gentleman, and of great integrity and honour in\r\nprivate life, but entirely enthusiastic on the Jacobite principles.\r\nAs the Young Pretender had wrote letters soon after his landing to\r\nmost of those whom he thought would favour his design, Lord Pitsligo\r\nwas not neglected; and though he was now old and might have had merit\r\nenough from the party for former services, yet he could not withstand\r\nthis address, but immediately began to stir and rouse the friends of\r\nthe Cause. In his letters on that subject he usually called the young\r\nPretender by the name of the Amiable young Stranger. It was not however\r\nimagined that in such an infirm state, as he then was, he would have\r\nthought of undergoing the fatigues of a Winter Campaign, especially\r\nas he had a very small estate, and no Vassalages or Following to his\r\nFamily, and so could not in that way make any considerable accession\r\nto the Party. But now that the family of Marischall was out of the\r\ncountry, and the Earl of Kintore, the next representative of that\r\nfamily, was in the interest of the Government, the gentlemen of Buchan\r\nwho were friends of the cause and used formerly to follow Marischall,\r\nimmediately had their eyes fixed on Lord Pitsligo to head them. But\r\nall these that appeared in Buchan would not probably have been of\r\nconsideration enough to have determined him, if soon after Preston,\r\na set of gentlemen in Boyne and Enzie[336] set agog by this victory\r\nhad not made this an express condition to their going out, that Lord\r\nPitsligo should go as their head. It was generally believed that\r\nthis condition was insisted on by one or two of them who had been\r\nrash enough to be always speaking of their going out if they had an\r\nopportunity, and now that it came to the push, repented of it and\r\nthought still of getting off and some honour, by offering to go only\r\nif Lord Pitsligo went at their head, which they reckoned themselves\r\nsure one of his age never would; and if he did not they might then\r\npretend they had no confidence in any attempt of this kind for which\r\nLord Pitsligo would not venture all. But if this was their view they\r\nwere disappointed in it, for the rest of these gentlemen consenting to\r\njoin them in making the same proposal to Lord Pitsligo, he accepted of\r\nit and so there was no retracting. The gentlemen who from this country\r\njoined his Lordship, or who were in concert with them, were Sir William\r\nGordon of Park, Gordon of Carnusy, Gordon of Cupbairdy, Mr. Hay,\r\nYounger of Ranas, Forbes of Brucehill, Gordon of Glastirrum, Abernethy,\r\nbrother to Mayen, and several other gentlemen of lesser note. Carnusy\r\nand Cupbairdy’s journey was a great surprise. The latter had no manner\r\nof tincture that way, but being a rambling young lad was determined\r\nmostly by comradeship and something too by the high regard he had for\r\nLord Pitsligo. Carnusy was esteemed a wise, solid man and some one not\r\nat all wedded to Kingscraft. But as many debts of his never heard of\r\nformerly are appearing, this somewhat unravels the mystery.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joined by Buchan Gentlemen, and Aberdeen’s etc._\r\n\r\nImmediately on Lord Pitsligo’s resolution being known there appeared\r\nalso to join him, Sir William Dunbar of Durn, from Boyne, Mr. Gordon of\r\nHallhead and Mr. Mercer, gentlemen of considerable note that resided\r\nusually in the town of Aberdeen: Mr. Gordon of Mill of Kinkardine, Mr.\r\nPetrie, Sheriff Depute, Mr. Sandilands and several gentlemen of the\r\nlower class from that place; from Buchan, Mr. More of Lonmay,[337]\r\nFactor to the Countess of Errol,[338] Cuming, younger, of Pitully,\r\nGordon younger, of Logie, Cuming of Kinninmuth, Ogilvie of Achirris,\r\n(all gentlemen of considerable estates), Thomson elder and younger of\r\nFachfield, Turner younger of Turnerhall, Fraser brother to Inveralachy\r\nand some others of less note; also from the country about Aberdeen,\r\nMr. Irvin of Drum, two sons of Menzies of Pitfodels, [Charles] More\r\nbrother to Stonnywood, etc. But none of these gentlemen raised any\r\nnumber of men, but all rendevous’d at Aberdeen on horseback, with\r\ntheir servants, and made a pretty enough appearance. Mr. Sandilands\r\nonly raised a Company of Foot which joined them there, as also did two\r\ncompanies raised by Stonnywood, the one commanded by himself, and the\r\nother by his brother; the whole not amounting to 200 men. These did\r\nindeed march south with Lord Pitsligo, but were afterwards incorporated\r\nin the Duke of Perth’s second Battalion. Lord Pitsligo and his friends\r\nwere but short time in Aberdeen, but while they stayed, conducted with\r\ngreat discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rebels favoured by Commons_\r\n\r\nHitherto the Rebellion was favoured by almost all the common people.\r\nThe promise of freeing them from the Malt Tax had a surprising\r\ninfluence upon them, this being a tax the Farmers are especially\r\nsensible of, as they themselves pay out the money in the first instance\r\nbeing all Maltsters, at least for their own use. The Rebels therefore\r\nhitherto behaving civilly, listing only volunteers, paying freely,\r\ntaking but some few good horses and arms as they met with them, and\r\nfreeing the country people from the eternal dread they were under of\r\nthe Malt Gaugers, were looked on by them as the deliverers of their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Why no Opposition made by the Friends of the Government_\r\n\r\nIt may at first seem surprising that no steps were taken in two such\r\ncountys by the friends of the Government to stop this procedure.\r\nBut let it be considered that after Preston people were really in a\r\nconsternation for some time, and nobody knew (as the intelligence from\r\nthe south, meeting with so many interruptions, was very uncertain) how\r\nsoon the Government might be in a situation to force the Rebels from\r\nEdinburgh so that they might have had leisure enough to have sent north\r\nDetachments and destroyed all that would attempt to disturb their\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nBesides it was requisite to have a man of rank and quality at the head\r\nof such a thing (as the Government thought not fit to give anybody\r\nthe authority of a Lord Lieutenant) to give a proper weight to it.\r\nBut such was the situation of the Nobility of these countys, that no\r\nsuch thing could have been expected of any of them except the Earl of\r\nAberdeen, whose undoubted attachment to the Government as well as his\r\nlarge estate and high rank might indeed have made him very serviceable\r\nhad he thought it prudent to have tried to raise the friends of the\r\nGovernment.[339] The Duke of Gordon, had it not been prevented by his\r\nindisposition, might have been of great use not only in keeping these\r\nCounties quiet, but even in suppressing the Rebellion altogether. The\r\nEarl of Findlater’s[340] sickly constitution quite disabled him, and\r\nthough the Earl of Kintore[341] had had a greater relish for military\r\nmatters than he has, yet the incumbrances on his fortune would have\r\nbeen a drawback on him. The Lord Forbes[342] had by no means an Estate\r\nsuited to his ability though he had inclined to appear. The Lord\r\nSalton[343] had no weight in the county, and the Lord Braco[344] had\r\na great estate, yet the newness of his family would have marred any\r\nproject of his forming.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gentry_\r\n\r\nHad the gentry that did not engage been all hearty, they might indeed\r\nhave come together without any of the nobility’s appearing to head\r\nthem, but undoubtedly a third of them were dissaffected though they\r\nwere wise enough not to embark in so desperate an enterprise; and of\r\nthose that were not so, many were selfish, many were careless who\r\ngoverned, and many were timid and fearful, so that the few who were\r\nresolute had not sufficient strength nor influence to make a stand.\r\nThe most remarkable of these in Buchan and Fortmartine[345] were Lord\r\nStrichen, Mr. Maitland of Pitrichy, Mr. Forbes of Shevis, Mr. Garden\r\nof Troup and Mr. Buchan of Achmacoy. On Don side, Mr. Middleton of\r\nSeaton, Mr. Patan, Grandam, Sir Arthur Forbes, Mr. Burnet of Kemnay,\r\nSir Archibald Grant and Mr. Leith of Glenkindy. In Garrioch, Mr. Horn\r\nof Westhall, Mr. Leith of Freefield, Sir Alexander Reed of Barra and\r\nMr. Forbes of Blackfoord. On Deeside, the family of Leys[346] with\r\nMr. Duff of Premnay. (_N.B._ a great part of Deeside is in the shire\r\nof Mearns.) As to the towns, Banff and the Seaport towns betwixt it\r\nand Aberdeen were mostly all dissaffected. Full two-thirds of the two\r\ntowns of Aberdeen were very well-affected to the Government. All the\r\nMagistrates, or rather those who had been such, before Hamilton came to\r\ntown, and all the old Provosts and Bailies (which makes a considerable\r\nnumber of the principal merchants), and both the colleges behaved in\r\nan exemplary, steady manner. The Clergy of the Church of Scotland were\r\nto a man firm in the interest of the Government in these counties and\r\nindeed everywhere else, and neither force nor flattery could alter\r\nthem. The Rebels at the beginning were at great pains to coax them,\r\nand to see if possible to make the face of a party among them, and\r\nwould have been excessively fond of the least compliance, had it been\r\nonly the not praying for the King by name, however minutely he should\r\nhave been described otherways, well-knowing that if any would go into\r\na different way from their brethren in any thing however trifling at\r\nfirst, that difference might be blown up to make a more considerable\r\nopposition. They had particularly hopes of the young Clergy, as they\r\nhad used to keep company with them more freely in times of peace,\r\nand not carry with so much reserve as their elder brethren, and so\r\nthey thought they should have much influence with them. But they\r\nwere excessively baulked when they saw them maintain with vigour and\r\nzeal those principles of liberty which formerly they thought they\r\nspoke of only for amusement, when they saw them at such extraordinary\r\npains to raise worthy sentiments in the people, and sparing neither\r\npurse nor persons in the service of the Government as far as they had\r\nopportunity; and by how much they expected more friendship from them\r\nthan from the old folks, so much the more were they incensed against\r\nthem than against the others from whom they expected nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Synod meets_\r\n\r\nThe Synod met as usual in October in Old Meldrum, and though in the\r\n1715 they would venture to do nothing, but immediately adjourned,\r\nyet now amidst no less danger they acted with much more vigour. They\r\nordered a very dutiful and warm address to his Majesty which was\r\nafterwards very highly resented by the Jacobites, not only as it\r\nshowed the loyalty of the Clergy, but confuted the lies published by\r\nthe Rebels in their Edinburgh _Courant_, that the whole gentlemen\r\nin the county except four had engaged in the Rebellion, whereas the\r\nClergy thought themselves obliged not only to vindicate the county in\r\ngeneral, but particularly to do justice to the gentlemen of the Church\r\nof Scotland, by asserting that few or none of them had engaged in\r\nthis wicked Rebellion. And indeed some gentlemen then in London owned\r\nthemselves very happy in this Address, that came very seasonably, and\r\nhad a very good effect, not only in taking off the bad impressions\r\nthe friends of the Government had of these counties, but also in\r\ndiscouraging the Jacobites by undeceiving them of the vain expectations\r\nthey had from there. The Synod also had a public diet for Prayer to\r\nAlmighty God to put a speedy stop to the Rebellion, which had a good\r\neffect not only on such of the laiety as were near enough to be present\r\nat it, but also tended to confirm and spirit up several that only heard\r\nof it. They also resolved, that whereas some ministers in their public\r\nprayers used formerly to think his Majesty sufficiently distinguished\r\nfrom the Pretender by calling him our Protestant Sovereign or some\r\nsuch other appellation, but as the omitting to name him expressly even\r\nthough thus characterised was looked on as a compliance by the Rebels,\r\nwho deluded many of the people with a story of their pretended Prince\r\nbeing a Protestant, that therefore all in time coming should pray for\r\nhim by name, as they would be answerable. They also appointed that\r\nPresbyteries should meet often, and members be sent as correspondents\r\nbetwixt neighbouring Presbyteries that they might advise with one\r\nanother at this critical time and act with the greatest harmony. All\r\nthis was punctually executed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nonjurant Clergy_\r\n\r\nThere were but two Clergy of the Church of England in all these\r\nCounties who were qualified to the Government, both at Aberdeen,\r\nbut here was a very considerable number of that persuasion who were\r\nNonjurants, which is to be sure the same thing with avowed Jacobites,\r\nand though most of them had the address to keep themselves free from\r\nopen acts of Rebellion yet they were excessively instrumental by\r\nevery sly act to poison the people and debauch them to rebellion, and\r\naccordingly all their hearers, almost without exception, were rank\r\nJacobites, and the being so, was by them esteemed so very essential\r\nto salvation, that even before the Rebellion they have been known to\r\nrefuse to admit some of their hearers to the Communion not only if by\r\ngoing to a Presbyterian Church, but even if by going to a qualified\r\nmeeting of the Church of England they had heard King George prayed for,\r\nunless they solemnly professed their repentance for this crime. After\r\nthe Rebellion broke out, several of them turned so insolent as to pray\r\nfor the Pretender by name. All of this persuasion as they all along had\r\na most unaccountable enmity against the Church of Scotland, so they\r\nfailed not to show it with a deal of rancour during the Rebellion, to\r\nall of that persuasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Papists_\r\n\r\nIt was but natural to expect that the Papists should favour the\r\nRebellion to their utmost, but they are but inconsiderable in these\r\nCounties. Their meetings were quite barefaced, the Pretender openly\r\nprayed for, and a very great and good understanding there was betwixt\r\nthe Nonjurants and them, so that Seaton, a priest, and Law, a Nonjurant\r\nminister,[347] were very commonly joined together among Lord Lewis\r\nGordon’s council, who was made Governor of these counties by the\r\nPretender. The Papists however generally had the cunning to be rather\r\nmore tolerable in conversation with the friends of the Government than\r\nthe Nonjurants were.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord Lewis Gordon joins the Rebels_\r\n\r\nBefore the Rebels marched from Edinburgh to England they very wisely\r\nthought of means of retaining these counties under their subjection,\r\nwhile they should be marching south and of having reinforcements from\r\nthence ready for them against any emergence. For this purpose they\r\nwheedled over to their party Lord Lewis Gordon,[348] a younger brother\r\nto his Grace the Duke of Gordon, imagining that the very name of one\r\nso nearly connected to the Duke would have a great influence on the\r\ntenants and dependants of that family, and they well knew that His\r\nGrace’s indisposition at that time would prevent any effectual measures\r\nbeing taken to stop this procedure. Lord Lewis was a Lieutenant in the\r\nFleet, and had unhappily come down at that time to visit his Mother,\r\nthe Duchess Dowager, who stayed near Edinburgh.[349] There he met\r\nso many old friends and acquaintances engaged in the Rebellion, who\r\nlaid all oars in the water to gain him; and this indeed was no hard\r\nmatter to a forward young lad like him, especially as he was to have a\r\nFeather in his cap, and to be made Lord Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire and\r\nGovernor of the Towns of Aberdeen and Banff, with power of disposing of\r\nall places in them. Along with him is set down More of Lonmay, More of\r\nStonnywood, Gordon of Avachy and Sheriff Petrie to assist him in his\r\nGovernment and Levys. There were also a number of Towns Burgesses named\r\nas a Council with them for the Town of Aberdeen and to manage under him\r\nin his absence but they all refused to accept; on which Mr. Moir of\r\nLonmay was made Deputy Governor of Aberdeen, much indeed against his\r\nown inclination. He was a sensible man, but turned out very positive\r\nand arbitrary in his Government, which he had frequent opportunities of\r\nshowing as Lord Lewis did not reside much at Aberdeen, and when he did,\r\nwas always much advised by Lonmay. Mr. Bairde of Achmeden[350] was at\r\nthe same time made Depute Governor of Banff. This gentleman had shown\r\nhis affection to the cause so far as to wait for the Young Pretender\r\nat Edinburgh with his white cockade, but it seems was not so far\r\nmilitarily disposed as to think of marching with them into England, but\r\nhaving a considerable estate in Banffshire, they thought he might be of\r\nservice to them in this sphere; but though he at first accepted of this\r\ncommission, yet he seldom if ever acted in consequence of it, and very\r\nrarely made any public appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Men Raised by Force_\r\n\r\nThe Lord Lieutenant began with his recruiting about Strathboggy, but as\r\nthe waifest kind of people had mostly gone off in the first Levys, this\r\nwas not so successful as he expected. Nay, on his first coming there,\r\nhis summonses to his brother’s tenants to rise were so slighted, and\r\nvolunteers so backward, that he was obliged to write to Blelack[351]\r\nand some of the gentlemen of Deeside who had a number of men with them,\r\nbegging of them for God’s sake to send him a command of their men that\r\nhe might not be affronted. How soon he got these, then he went to work\r\nquartering on the tenants about Strathboggy till they either rose or\r\nfurnished men according to the proportions he had settled. But this was\r\ntedious, as he had but a small party to quarter with, and therefore\r\nhe soon took a more expeditious way, threatening to burn the houses\r\nand farmyards of such as stood out. This soon had the desired effect,\r\nfor the burning a single house or farm stack in a Parish terrified the\r\nwhole, so that they would quickly send in their proportion, and by this\r\nmeans, with the few that joined as volunteers, he raised near 300 men\r\ncalled the Strathboggy Battalion in the country thereabouts. The same\r\nmethod of military execution (a discipline till then unknown in these\r\ncounties) was used in most of the high parts of the shire for forcing\r\nout men, especially on Deeside, where a great many were raised in\r\nthis manner. Stonnywood however found people enough about the town of\r\nAberdeen and places adjacent without force, to form another corps for\r\nLord Lewis called the Aberdeen Battallion consisting of about 200 men,\r\nwhich with the Strathboggy Batallion formed what was properly Lord\r\nLewis’ own Regiment; Avachy being Lieutenant of the latter; Stonnywood\r\nof the former.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Auchengaul raises a Company_\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Crichton of Auchengaul, a Popish gentleman of a\r\nvery small estate, but representative of the Viscount Frendraught,\r\nraised a company and joined Lord Lewis. There were also several little\r\npeople in Banffshire and Buchan, etc., who raised a few men each, and\r\njoined the Lord Lieutenant and all got commissions of one kind or\r\nother, which was by no means hard to be obtained. And thus the whole\r\nof this second Levy in the Counties of Aberdeen and Banff, under Lord\r\nLewis would have amounted to near 800 men.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Comparison with 1715_\r\n\r\nAs the above is a view of the whole course of the Rebels from these\r\nCounties, it may not be amiss to compare it with what it was in the\r\n1715, from which it will be evident that for all the noise they made\r\nabout their strength in these parts it was nothing now in comparison\r\nwith what it was then.\r\n\r\nIn the 1715 they were supported by most of the Nobility. The Duke\r\nof Gordon (then Marquis of Huntly), the Earls of Mar, Marischall,\r\nPanmure, and Kintore, and the Lords Fraser and Pitsligo, who had all\r\ngreat estates, connections and dependencies in these Counties, raised\r\ntheir whole force and exerted themselves to the utmost in favour of\r\nthe Rebellion. Whereas now Lord Pitsligo was the only nobleman that\r\njoined them unless Lord Lewis be reckoned. As to the landed gentry the\r\ndifference is full as considerable. Though the most be from Banffshire\r\nand Buchan, yet even there they are not one fourth of what they were\r\nin the 1715. Not one gentleman from Fortmartine unless Mr. Smith of\r\nMenie be to be reckoned, who indeed appeared with them at Edinburgh,\r\nbut left them or they entered England. Not one gentleman that resided\r\nin Garrioch,[352] though in the 1715 most of them were concerned.\r\nOnly five on Deeside from the head to the foot. And though there were\r\nseveral gentlemen of small estates on Deeside, yet all of them put\r\ntogether were not equal to the Laird of Invercauld who engaged in\r\nthe former Rebellion. The Commons must always bear Proportion to the\r\ninterests of the Gentry engaged, and though indeed this rule failed in\r\nso far at this time as that considerable numbers were raised from the\r\nestates of the Duke of Gordon, Earl of Aboyne, and Laird of Invercauld,\r\nwhere the Rebels had properly no interest, yet as almost none of the\r\ngentlemen that went with Lord Pitsligo raised so much as the men on\r\ntheir own estates, this will in good measure balance the other. There\r\nwere several merchants of note appeared from the towns in the 1715, but\r\nnow none but a few smugglers, and a very few tradesmen.\r\n\r\nAs the Rebels had thus a considerable number of men in these Counties,\r\nthey next fell to work to raise money for their maintenance. And first\r\nof all they resolved to levy the Cess that was due for the current\r\nyear, and all arrears, and accordingly the Lord Lieutenant named a\r\ncollector, and without further intimation ordered partys to quarter\r\nfor it. As it was soon moving from one house to another in the towns\r\nand country about them, as the quartering money was very exorbitant,\r\ntheir partys numerous and costly to maintain, and the Cess being levied\r\nonly according to the valued rent, and not being anything considerable\r\nin comparison of the real rent and few being willing to bear the\r\nstress any time for a small sum, it was quickly levied in the towns\r\nof Aberdeen and from the adjacent estates. But in the country it\r\nnecessarily took up longer time so that they never got parties sent\r\nto some estates that were most out of the way, and some gentlemen,\r\nparticularly Mr. Burnet, Kemnay, and Mr. Horn, Westhall, bore the\r\nstress with great firmness and wearied them out of it at this time, as\r\nindeed Mr. Horn at length did altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The French Land_\r\n\r\nIn the month of December there arrived six transports at Peterhead,\r\nAberdeen, Stonehaven, and Montrose with Lord John Drummond’s Regiment\r\non board and the Piquets from the Irish Brigade in the French Service;\r\nall under the command of Lord John Drummond.[353] This greatly elevated\r\nthe Rebels, was magnified hugely to their friends in other places, and\r\nlooked upon by them all as the certain prelude of a great invasion\r\nfrom France. The two Lord Drummonds[354] and the Lord Lieutenant had\r\nan interview at Aberdeen, the great result of which, seemed to be the\r\nforging a letter from Lord Martial commanding his friends to join Lord\r\nJohn Drummond (_vid._ printed Copy) and a Proclamation in which his\r\nLordship, also to show him how well he was acquainted to the French\r\nGovernment, threatens to punish those who did not join him according\r\nto their intentions. The letter from Lord Martial was soon suspected\r\nto be forged, from its being altered while a-printing, and from the\r\nstyle of it, it being very unlike Lord Martial to speak of Commanding\r\nhis Friends, but after Culloden it was put out of doubt by one Mr.\r\nHalyburton, who had been sent from France by Lord Martial, how soon he\r\nknew of it, to disclaim the thing entirely, to let Lord John know how\r\nmuch he took it amiss, and to warn his friends not to be seduced by\r\nit.[355] The Rebels were on the other Speyside before this gentleman\r\nreached them, and how soon he informed Lord John of his errand, he was\r\neither closely confined or then discharged on the severest penalty\r\nfrom speaking of it, so that it was but little known, till the Flight,\r\nwhen he acquainted several gentlemen of it, who after that made it no\r\nsecret. The French that landed at Peterhead, Aberdeen, and Stonehaven,\r\nstayed not above a week or so to refresh themselves, but marched south\r\nto the Camp at Perth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Levy Money_\r\n\r\nThe Cess went but a short way to answer their demands, next therefore\r\nthey resolved to demand what was called Levy Money, or Militia money;\r\naccordingly Stonnywood by order of the Lord Lieutenant wrote Circular\r\nletters to the several gentlemen or their factors, demanding an able\r\nbodied man sufficiently accoutred in the Highland Dress[356] for each\r\n£100 Scots of valued rent, or then £5 Sterling to raise one. The man\r\nwas but a pretext, it was the money they wanted. This indeed would\r\nhave amounted to a very considerable sum; no less than about £12,000\r\nSterling for the County of Aberdeen alone, which will be 5_s._ Ster.\r\nin the pound off the real rack’d rent, which exorbitant demand would\r\nat any time have been very hard upon Lairds and Tenants but after two\r\nbad crops and so many other losses, was indeed more than they could\r\nbear. However these reasons availed nothing to the Lord Lieutenant, or\r\nhis Depute (who was by no means ignorant of the state of the counties)\r\nbut to work they went, how soon they had got in most of the Cess, to\r\nquarter for it. This began at length to open the eyes of many of the\r\npeople, who had been formerly cheated by promises of freedom from\r\ntaxes, especially the Malt Tax, but now they saw how delusive these\r\nwere, and this not a little confirmed the few who had all along wished\r\nwell to the Government. Even the selfish among the gentry who professed\r\nnot to care who reigned, were not now quite so indifferent, and even\r\nmany secret Jacobites were disgusted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord Loudon Invited_\r\n\r\nThe friends of the Government seeing no end of this oppression, while\r\nthe Rebels were their masters, sent several messages to the President\r\nand Lord Loudon[357] to send some men to their relief. They were\r\nespecially instant from the town of Aberdeen, this being the seat of\r\ntheir Government, and consequently most exposed to their tyranny,\r\nwhich was so great that the usual freedom of conversation was entirely\r\nbanished, at least none could promise how long they could call anything\r\ntheir own, and even already they were speaking of imposing a Loan,\r\nhow soon the Militia money was levied. But their keenness to obtain\r\nrelief and to persuade Lord Loudon to undertake it, probably made them\r\nrepresent the strength of the Rebels as more insignificant than it\r\nreally was, which no doubt has been one reason why the party sent was\r\nnot more numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Burning Order_\r\n\r\nThe Levy money coming in but slowly, for all the stress of quartering,\r\nwhich stress alone induced some to pay it, but some few that were\r\nsuch hearty friends as to need only the pretence of force, the Lord\r\nLieutenant grew quite impatient and issued what was called the Fire\r\nOrdinance (vid. _Gent. Mag._ for January 1746, p. 29th).[358] Party’s\r\nwere sent to several Districts of the country, with orders to quarter\r\non the gentlemen’s houses (not on the tenants’ as usual) and if\r\nagainst such a time the money was not payed, to begin with burning the\r\ngentleman’s house and Planting, then the tenants’ houses and cornyards\r\nand so on through the district. But notwithstanding of these dreadful\r\nthreatenings, none but some very timourous people paid, till they\r\nshould at least see what would be the consequences of the Northern aid\r\nwhich now began to be spoke of and pretty confidently expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Aberdeen Distressed_\r\n\r\nAs the old town of Aberdeen had in proportion to such a place\r\ndiscovered a more than ordinary zeal for the Government so that the\r\nRebel Governors distinguished it accordingly by a demand of £215\r\nSter. of Levy money, a very great sum for so small a village, and by\r\nbeginning with them these new methods of raising it. They impudently\r\nproposed it among the Whigs without ever regarding whether or not they\r\nhad any property in Lands or houses and particularly the Masters of\r\nthe Kings College had their small stipends very severely cessed. But\r\nwhen they could not even thus get their full demand answered, Lonmay\r\nordered about £40 Ster. of it to be taken from the Poor’s Box and from\r\nsome small funds that belonged to an hospital for poor widows and some\r\nother such charitable funds. Large parties were quartered through the\r\ntown in the gentlemen’s houses for several days, but even this severe\r\nstress not proving effectual, intimation was made by Tuke of Drum, that\r\nif the money was not paid against a certain hour the Town was to be\r\nburnt. This indeed alarmed them and the gentlemen were forced to seem\r\nin so far to comply as to beg only delays till the money should be got,\r\nand this they had the art to obtain from time to time for two or three\r\ndays, till at length they had pretty certain information that McLeod\r\nand Culcairn’s men were come the length of Banff and Strathboggy, on\r\nwhich most of the gentlemen of note in the place, slipped out of town\r\nor concealed themselves, without paying a farthing, and leaving the\r\nRebels to do with the town what they pleased. But as they too were\r\nsensible by this time of the enemy’s approach they would not venture on\r\nsuch a severity till they should see the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n_McLeod Marches_\r\n\r\nAs for McLeod’s March (vid. _Gents. Mag._, Jan. 1746, p. 23). It\r\nwas Gordon of Avachy and Gordon of Aberlour that opposed them at\r\nthe passage of the Spey, but they quickly retreated. They had the\r\nStrathboggy Batallion under their command and had been quartering\r\nfor Cess and Levy money about Strathboggy and Banff. They marched\r\nto Aberdeen the day appointed for the Public Fast by his Majesty,\r\nDecember 17th, which however was very punctually observed even where\r\nthey passed and in general was so both by Clergy and people both in\r\ntown and country, though the Clergy indeed did meet with some insults\r\nin a few places. Immediately on McLeod’s passing the Spey, the Rebels\r\ncalled in all their Quartering parties, and the Deeside men to the town\r\nof Aberdeen and sent expresses to their friends in Angus and Mearns to\r\nsend them assistance.\r\n\r\nThe McLeods joined the two companies under Culkairn,[359] at Inverury,\r\nupon Saturday, December 20th, the whole body being 700 men complete.\r\n400 of those under McLeod were quartered in the town of Inverury,\r\nthe rest of that name and Culkairn’s two companies were cantonned in\r\nfarmers’ houses along the Ury to the north west of the town, many of\r\nthem more than a mile and a half’s distance though there was no worldly\r\nnecessity for this, as the town of Inverury contained two regiments of\r\nthe Duke’s army for some weeks without a man of them going a stone cast\r\nfrom it. Against night the Rebel Reinforcements were come to Aberdeen\r\nconsisting of about 150 of the French Picquets who had remained at\r\nMontrose and more than 200 Angus and Mearns Militia, so that there\r\nwould have been in whole about 1200 men at Aberdeen. All the Saturday\r\nthe Rebels were exceeding careful to prevent any intelligence coming\r\nto the McLeods, securing as far as possible all the Avenues coming\r\nfrom the town, and sending out scouts to scour between Kintore and\r\nInverury to the very water-side, these seized Mr. Bartlet an Aberdeen\r\nwriter who had come along with McLeod and had ventured to Kintore (2\r\nmiles from Inverury), where also Mr. Dingwall, an Aberdeen merchant and\r\nsome others coming with intelligence from Aberdeen were snapt up and\r\ncarried in prisoners. The McLeods had immediate notice of this, but\r\nCulcairn (by whom McLeod was directed as he himself did not pretend to\r\nunderstand military matters) could not be prevailed on to allow any\r\nmen to come over and drive them off, no doubt fearing as they were\r\nstrangers in the country lest they should be surprised. But as by this\r\nmeans at length all intelligence stopt, this proved their ruin in the\r\nend. Whereas by keeping some advance guards, or at least sending out\r\npatroles now and then, for a mile or two, they might indeed possibly\r\nhave lost a man or two in Rencountres with the enemy’s parties, and\r\npossibly the reverse might have happened, but still they’d have secured\r\nthe main chance and prevented the whole being surprised. However by\r\nthis conduct though frequently things of considerable importance were\r\nknown at Kintore, it was impossible to send the intelligence the\r\nremaining two miles. Nevertheless Sir Archibald Grant[360] who had come\r\nover the hill from the south, without touching at Aberdeen, and was\r\ncertainly informed on his way that a reinforcement of French would that\r\nnight be in town, fell on a way late that night to let McLeod know so\r\nmuch, and this intelligence probably prevented their marching to attack\r\nthe Rebels the next morning, till they should know their situation more\r\nexactly. There was no body more alert or serviceable in getting exact\r\nintelligence to the Rebels than Stonnywood, as he knew the country\r\nand the people exactly, and as his estate lay betwixt Aberdeen and\r\nInverury, he had all his tenants employed on the same service, so that\r\non Saturday night they had perfect intelligence of everything that\r\nconcerned the McLeods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Volunteers_\r\n\r\nThere were some Aberdeen gentlemen who had been either driven from town\r\nby the tyranny of the Rebels, or they had been sent on messages to the\r\nPresident, that came all along from Inverness as Volunteers in this\r\nexpedition: among these were Mr. Forbes of Echt, Mr. Logie a merchant,\r\nand Mr. Thomson, General Superviser of Excise, which last gentleman\r\nespecially was exceeding serviceable both on this, and several other\r\noccasions to the Government. The number of volunteers was increased\r\nat Inverury by Mr. Maitland, Pitrichy, Mr. Forbes of Shieves, Forbes\r\nof Echt, Mr. Chalmers, the now Principal of the King’s College, Mr.\r\nGordon, Professor of Humanity in the College, some merchants and\r\ntradesmen, several students of Divinity and Philosophy and Prentices\r\nfrom both towns of Aberdeen, and many more would have come if it had\r\nnot been the difficulty of getting out of town. But as McLeod had no\r\nspare arms, and the volunteers could get nothing but pistols they\r\nproved of no service. Mr. Horn, of Westhall, by promises of great\r\nrewards and encouragement, had got his tenants to engage to follow him\r\nand join the McLeods, and as he foresaw he could not get fire-arms,\r\nhad caused make a number of spears with iron heads, for them. But when\r\nit came to the push, they all drew back, their hearts failed them and\r\nthey refused to rise. On which, on Monday he was sending an Express\r\nto McLeod for a party to force them out, but his express met them\r\nretreating.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Detachment sent out_\r\n\r\nOn Sunday McLeod was prevailed on to send a large detachment of his\r\nown company over the water for three miles, which had a very happy\r\neffect, driving off all the enemy’s Scouts and facilitating their\r\nintelligence, so that they met with no less than three persons from\r\ntown that had come out in disguises and by byeways who brought letters\r\ngiving an exact account of the enemy’s numbers and situation, which\r\npeople otherways would all have been intercepted by their Scouts. This\r\nso entirely convinced the Lieutenant that commanded the detachment,\r\nof the necessity either of constant patroles, or then of an advance\r\nGuard at Kintore, that he had everything settled for one or other,\r\nnever doubting but his representation would prevail, but there was no\r\nconvincing Culkairn, so that next day there came not a man over the\r\nwater at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Enemy Alarmed_\r\n\r\nThe Enemy’s Scouts on being thus driven off, having seen the party but\r\nimperfectly, alarmed their friends in town with an account that the\r\nwhole of the McLeods were marching to attack them, on which they drew\r\ntogether, but were soon undeceived. The same night after it was dark\r\nthey convened their men and marched three miles out of town, as if to\r\nsurprise the enemy, but whether it was only a feint to see if their\r\nmen would stand by them, or if it was owing to any wrong notion that\r\nthe McLeods were apprised of them, they returned to town again without\r\ndoing anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rebels’ Artifice_\r\n\r\nThis day too, they had tried a strategem to raise a mutiny among the\r\nMcLeods by bribing a tenant’s son of McLeod’s (who had been staying\r\nwith a Nonjurant Minister, teaching his children Latin and so had\r\nimbibed all the Jacobite notions) to go to Inverury and see to persuade\r\nthe men that they were engaged in an unjust cause, that their enemies\r\nwere very numerous and powerful, and that Lord Loudon had purposely\r\nsent them up to be cut off in a strange country. As this fellow had\r\ntheir language, was their namesake and countryman, they readily\r\nlistened to him and it was taking among them like lightening, till the\r\nfellow was found out and apprehended, but the impression still stuck to\r\nthem, till McLeod drew them all out, and very particularly showed them\r\nthe roguery.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rebels march_\r\n\r\nOn Monday the 23rd, about 9 of clock in the morning, the Rebels marched\r\nfrom Aberdeen, in order to surprise the McLeods in two columns. The\r\nmain body being about 900 was commanded by Lord Lewis (though one Major\r\nCuthbert,[361] a French Officer, did all the business), crossed the\r\nBridge of Don, and took a round about and indirect road on the North\r\nside of the Don. The other column consisting of their Strathboggy\r\nBattallion, and commanded by Major Gordon, a French Officer, and\r\nAvachy, took the high road on the south side of the river. As they had\r\nall along guarded the avenues from the town very carefully, they did\r\nit now so effectually that there was no possibility of sending any\r\nintelligence of their march, till they were actually gone. When they\r\nwere marching they all along kept advance parties before their main\r\nbodies came in sight, so that when they were observed, these parties\r\nprevented any persons getting past with information. As the body that\r\nmarched the high road had by far the nearest way, they halted and\r\nconcealed themselves in the Church and church-yard of Kinellar about\r\nthree miles from Inverury, till the corps on the other side were\r\nsuitably advanced, and meantime had their advanced party concealed in\r\nsome houses in a low part of the road near Kintore.\r\n\r\nThis party seized the minister of Kintore, who had got some confused\r\nnotice of their march, and going out for more certain intelligence,\r\nand observing nothing on the road, had come that length where he was\r\nmade prisoner, as also at the very same time were no less than three\r\npeople with intelligence of the Rebels’ march from the town, who had\r\ngot out when their Guards were taken off, and escaped the main body by\r\nbyeways, till being so near Inverury they had (to shorten the way) come\r\nin there to the high road, never doubting but they’d have met with some\r\nof the McLeods advanced parties to protect them, as those had done that\r\ncame out the former day. The column that marched on the north side of\r\nDon had Scouts concealed among Planting of the Earl of Kintore’s on a\r\nrising ground that overlooked Inverury, and though some while before\r\nthe enemy came up they were observed going backwards and forwards\r\nfrom the Park, and pointed out to McLeod and Culkairn as looking very\r\nsuspicious, yet by some fatality they neglected to send up and see what\r\nthey were doing. Immediately as they marched, the minister of Rayne,\r\nwho happened to be in town, rode out by the Deeside Road, the only one\r\nleft unguarded, to see if it was possible this way to get before them;\r\nbut this was so greatly about, and the road when he came to cross the\r\ncountry so excessively bad that the firing was begun or he reached\r\nKintore. So that the first intelligence they got of them was the Main\r\nBody being observed by their sentry, marching down by the Earl of\r\nKintore’s parks within a quarter of a mile of Inverury.\r\n\r\n\r\n_McLeods draw out_\r\n\r\nMcLeod, Culkairn, and all the officers with the few men they had in\r\ntown got together very resolutely, and all of them discovered a great\r\ndeal of courage on this occasion, nay, to think at all of standing\r\nagainst such superior numbers bespoke no little bravery. And indeed\r\nhad they thought of sending down a party to line the Church yard of\r\nInverury, and had others rightly posted on a little hull, called the\r\nBass, both which were within a pistol shot of the Boat and Ford of Ury\r\nwhere the Main body behoved to pass, and also on the Ford of Don where\r\nAvachy, etc., passed, they certainly had done great execution among\r\nthem in their passages, and if they had not stopped them altogether,\r\nwould at least have retarded them till the men that were canton’d at a\r\ndistance had got up to their assistance, for the Rebels had no cannon,\r\nbut two old rusty ones they had taken from ships, which got not up\r\ntill long after the skirmish was over, and though they had, would not\r\nprobably have done great execution. But the confusion and surprise of\r\nthe McLeods at the unexpected coming of the enemy made them neglect all\r\nthese advantages, and stand on the Rigs on the east side at the south\r\nend of the town, at almost an equal distance from the Foords of Don\r\nand Ury, but at so great a distance as to be able to do execution at\r\nneither; and their standing here too was probably not a little owing\r\nto their then discovering the other body of the enemy coming upon\r\nthe other side of Don, which made them irresolute how to dispose of\r\nthemselves till so many of the Rebels crossed the Ury as put it out\r\nof their power to stop their passage there. It was also a vast loss\r\nto these Highlanders, who were none of them disciplined, that they\r\nhad only firelocks and bayonets, and wanted their darling weapon, the\r\nBroadsword, which is always their chief confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rebels pass the Foords_\r\n\r\nThe van of the Rebels’ main body consisted of the French and some\r\npicked men and was lead only by Major Cuthbert, these with all the\r\ngentlemen, the volunteers, and some of the common men crossed the\r\nUry, very alertly, and as they passed, drew up behind the Bass, and\r\nthe Churchyard. But many of their common men ran off and skulked by\r\ndike-sides till the action was over and could neither be brought out by\r\nthreats nor entreaties till then. Major Gordon and Avachy with about 50\r\nor 60 of their men crossed the Don very briskly, and behaved well, but\r\nthe rest of the Corps took shelter among the Broom, till they saw the\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nThe action began near an hour after sunset with a clear moonshine, by\r\nsome passing shots from some ten or twelve of the McLeods who advanced\r\nso far, some to the one Foord and some to the other, and fired on the\r\nenemy as they were passing and killed two or three men in the water,\r\nand immediately retired. The Body that crossed Ury moved up first to\r\nattack, but were received with two or three fires from the McLeods,\r\nwhich they returned indeed two for one, but both were at too great a\r\ndistance to do great execution. But as the party from Don was by this\r\ntime coming to attack them in flanks, and as the French were advancing\r\nwith a close regular fire and like to bear very hard on them, the\r\nMcLeods found themselves unable to stand this shock, and accordingly\r\ngave way; yet not so but that a party of them loaded their pieces\r\nretiring, and finding some of their men, especially the wounded, like\r\nto fall in the enemy’s hands, they wheeled about before they were\r\nhalf way up the town, and made another fire, but immediately ran\r\noff. On this the French advanced through the town with an incessant\r\nstreet fire, and the rest divided themselves and went firing up each\r\nside of it, being too by this time joined by most of their skulking\r\ncompanions. After this, as some of the McLeods were running off on\r\nthe stubble ground on the North end of the town, some person gave a\r\ncry that McLeod was taken, on which they turned about again and made\r\nanother fire but immediately marched off. The Rebels meanwhile being\r\nat a considerable distance and not observing them so exactly going\r\noff, but seeing a ridge with a few furrows in it, amidst a great deal\r\nof unploughed stubble ground, and taking it by the moonlight for a\r\nrow of men, they fired once or twice into it very successfully. And\r\nthus in whole the firing continued for more than twenty minutes. The\r\ncompanies of McLeods and Monroes that were cantonn’d out of the town,\r\nhad unluckily no Officers with them; these happened to be with McLeod\r\nin Inverury, and went out to engage along with the men that were there\r\n(which by the bye as there were thirty of them on guard, and many\r\nstraggling through the country seeking provisions did not much exceed\r\nthree hundred), these therefore having no body to draw them together,\r\nran up different ways on hearing the firing till they met some of their\r\nfriends flying, or were informed of the event, and then they ran off.\r\nBut had their officers been with them to bring them together, and lead\r\nthem up in a body to meet their friends at the north end of the town\r\nand support them, they very possibly might have turned the scale in\r\ntheir favours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loss on both sides_\r\n\r\nThe Rebels for a while concealed their loss, but ’tis now generally\r\nallowed they had at least ten or twelve killed, several of these\r\nFrench, but all common men. It is indeed generally believed that one\r\nof them was a French Officer, as he was put in a grave by himself with\r\nseveral Popish Ceremonies, though not certain. But the Rebels still\r\nrefuse that it was an Officer. They had also a good many wounded, among\r\nwhom was Mr Gordon of Birkenbuss, a gentleman of a small estate, very\r\ndangerously.\r\n\r\nThe McLeods again had only five killed dead on the spot, which was well\r\nknown, as their bodies were left exposed for some days or they allowed\r\nthem to be buried. One also died of his wounds in the retreat, as did\r\nanother that was taken prisoner, but they were all common men. About\r\nthirty were taken prisoners (many of which were wounded) including ten\r\nor twelve Humlys (Colones)[362] that they had picked up. Among the\r\nprisoners were Mr. Gordon, Ardvach, Lieutenant of Culkairn’s Company,\r\nMr. Chalmers, Principal of the King’s College, and Mr. Forbes of Echt;\r\nMcLeod’s own piper, McGrimman,[363] happened also to be taken, and\r\nthe piper is always looked on as a person of importance in a Highland\r\nChief’s retinue, but McGrimman especially was a respectable person\r\nbeing esteemed the best piper in the Highlands, having had most of the\r\nClan pipers as his scholars, and being looked on by them as a kind of\r\nchief, and the veneration they had for him appeared when he was carried\r\nprisoner to their army at Stirling, for it is said not a Highland piper\r\nwould play a tune till McGrimman was allowed to be on his parole, and\r\nhe himself behaved with so much state that he would play to none of\r\nthem till their prince himself desired him. Mr. Maitland, Pitrichy,\r\nescaped to Keithhall, the house of the Earl of Kintore, the night of\r\nthe engagement, where he concealed himself all next day, but unluckily\r\nventuring to show himself to Petry, the Sherriff Depute, who intruded\r\nhimself that night on the Earl, and Mr. Maitland, and he squabbling\r\nover drink, Petry not only in violation of the laws of hospitality, and\r\nof many obligations he was under to the Earl of Kintore, but also of\r\nhis own promise to the contrary, basely went off next morning and sent\r\na party of the Rebels who seized him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rebels do not venture to pursue_\r\n\r\nThe McLeods passed the Ury about a quarter of a mile from the town and\r\nrefreshed themselves at Rayne and Strathboggy, but stopped not a night\r\ntill they got over Spey, where McLeod waited the coming up of such of\r\nhis men as had gone other roads, and continued guarding the passes for\r\nsome while after. But the Rebels were so apprehensive what might be the\r\nconsequences when for ought they knew, they were joined by the Monroes,\r\netc., that they would not venture to pursue them over the Ury. McLeod\r\nlost most of his baggage, but the greater part came not into the Rebels\r\ncustody but was secreted and pilfered by the townsfolks.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Horn stress’d_\r\n\r\nAs the Rebels were informed of Mr. Horn’s design of joining the\r\nMcLeods, they were exceeding keen in their resentment against him, and\r\nimmediately sent a party to seize him, but he luckily had gone out of\r\nthe way. The party lived a good while at his house at free quarters and\r\nmade very free with everything, demanding the arms he had made, and\r\nthe Cess Levy money, but Mr. Horn had left positive orders though they\r\nshould burn the house to give them neither, and as their Officers had\r\nby this time got pretty certain information that their affairs were\r\nwrong in England and their Prince retreating, they did not choose in\r\nthese circumstances to do such a shocking thing. And it was certainly\r\na lucky thing that they got this intelligence to calm them after the\r\nflush of their Inverury victory, or then the Fire Order had undoubtedly\r\nbeen put in execution in these counties.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quartering for Levy Money_\r\n\r\nThe towns of Aberdeen having now no relief were obliged to pay\r\ntheir Quota of Levy money, that of the New town amounted to about\r\n£500 Sterling. A party of the Clan Chattan (Mclntoshes, Shaws and\r\nMcGilavrys) under McGilavry of Dunmaglass, being now come up from\r\nDundee to support their friends in Aberdeen in case of a straight,\r\nthese for the greater terror were employed as far as possible for\r\nquartering in the gentlemen’s houses in the country for the Levy money.\r\nBut the Rebels finding it would take longer time to get people forced\r\nto give the whole of their exorbitant demands than they could bestow,\r\nas they foresaw that in a week or so they must march to reinforce their\r\nfriends in the South, they were therefore willing to compound the\r\nmatter and take half in hand, and a bill for the other half payable at\r\nCandlemass, and in this way they gathered in a good deal of money. But\r\nstill there were several gentlemen stood out for a good while under all\r\nthe hardships they imposed, especially Mr. Leith of Freefield (whom\r\nthey also kept a while Prisoner), Mr. Patan of Grandsam, and Mr. Burnet\r\nof Kemnay. Mr. Burnet’s zeal for our constitution, and the endeavours\r\nhe used to awaken the British spirit among his neighbours, had rendered\r\nhim excessively obnoxious to the Rebels, they hunted him for some weeks\r\nfrom place to place, to seize him, but he at length got to Edinburgh,\r\nwhere he was obliged to stay till his Royal Highness marched for\r\nAberdeen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rebels called up_\r\n\r\nThe resolute delays of some few gentlemen, and the great number they\r\nhad to quarter upon, made it impracticable for the Rebels to collect\r\ntheir Levy money from much more than one half of these counties, before\r\nthey were called up and obliged to march and reinforce their friends\r\nin the South, so that almost all Buchan, and most of the more remote\r\nestates in both Banff and Aberdeenshire escaped at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Elsick’s Men, and McGregors come to Aberdeen_\r\n\r\nSoon after Lord Lewis marched up with the whole of the Rebels from\r\nthis country, there arrived a Spanish ship at Peterhead with arms and\r\nmoney, which brought a party of Elsick’s[364] men from the Mearns to\r\npossess Aberdeen and bring up this loading; but they being looked on\r\nas weak, a party of the McGregors joined them. None of these parties\r\nhowever ventured to the country but only while they were bringing up\r\ntheir cargo from Peterhead. Lord Lewis had been abundantly arbitrary in\r\nhis Government, Horses and Arms had been everywhere seized throughout\r\nthe counties, under the pretence of searching for arms; in houses both\r\nin town and country many things had been pilfered with impunity, and\r\nhe himself treated everybody with a great deal of insolence, but all\r\nthis was but a jest in comparison with these McGregors. They went to\r\npeople’s houses through the town and always behaved so very rudely as\r\nto make them forced to give them money to go away. They would stop\r\ngentlemen on the streets openly, and either take their silver buckles\r\nand buttons from them, or oblige them to give so much to redeem them.\r\nWithout the least provocation they would beat and abuse people; and\r\nwhenever they took it into their heads to enquire about any gentlemen’s\r\nprinciples they met with, they came up with their broadswords drawn and\r\nasked what King they were for? If they hesitated the least in answering\r\n‘King James,’ they were sure of a slap, and never got away till they\r\nsat down on their knees and swore to the Pretender, and cursed King\r\nGeorge in any terms the ruffians pleased. But happily they soon went\r\noff with the arms and left Elsick’s men only to guard the town. These\r\ncontinued mostly till the retreat of their army and behaved pretty\r\ncivilly; indeed though they had inclined to do otherwise, yet the\r\ntown’s people not being under so much restraint as formerly, began to\r\nshow themselves so keenly, that they made them glad to be peaceable,\r\nfor fear of their being mobbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rebels retreat from Stirling_\r\n\r\nThe whole Rebel Army, except the Clans that went the Highland road\r\nwith their Prince, passed through Aberdeenshire on their retreat from\r\nStirling. They marched in two columns (the clans making a third), Lord\r\nLewis Gordon’s men, the Deeside men, Glenbucket’s men and some other\r\nbody’s forming one column and marching in the high road to Strathboggy.\r\nThe rest of their army formed another column and marched with such\r\nbaggages as they had got off from Stirling, or the Clans had left them,\r\nthrough the town of Aberdeen. They were commanded by Lord George Murray\r\nand consisted mostly of the Athole Brigade, French, Lord Ogilvies\r\nmen,[365] Cromarty’s, Kilmarnock’s, Kelly’s,[366] Elsick’s, Lifeguards,\r\nHussars, and all their other Lowland Corps. They stayed but short while\r\nin Aberdeen and so had not great opportunity of doing much mischief,\r\nthough they seemed not at all averse to do it. For the ill situation\r\nof their affairs and their marching in such cold stormy weather, put\r\nthem in a great fret. They threatened dreadful things against they\r\nshould return Conquerors, particularly against the Clergy of the\r\nChurch of Scotland, on which subject none was more violent than Lord\r\nJohn Drummond, who once and again proposed the hanging of some of them\r\nfor examples; and indeed the Clergy were so sensible of their danger,\r\nthat if the Duke had been obliged to retreat again, most of them had\r\nresolved to prepare to leave the country. They divided at Aberdeen and\r\nmarched to Spey, some by Old Meldrum and Banff and some by Inverury and\r\nStrathboggy. At Speyside they all joined and met there with the other\r\ncolumn. There was a good deal of pilfering by their stragglers in this\r\nmarch, but when the country people had the resolution to oppose them,\r\nthey behaved very cowardly. The minister of Clate[367] in particular\r\nand a few of his parishioners unarmed, took the guns and bayonets from\r\ntwo Strathboggy men who fired on the people for finding fault with\r\ntheir robbing a dyeing woman of her bedclothes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hussars and Stonnywood’s men left in Aberdeen_\r\n\r\nStonnywood’s men though they had marched so far in the Highroad, yet\r\ncame off from the rest of their corps and marched down by Deeside to\r\nAberdeen, where they remained after the main body had left it, along\r\nwith the Hussars under one Colonel Baggot,[368] a French Officer, and\r\na very rough sort of man and so exceeding well fitted to command the\r\nBanditti of which that Corps was composed, and to distress a country.\r\nThe Lord Lieutenant was along with their Prince, so Lonmay, the Depute\r\nGovernor, had the chief direction, though both he and Stonnywood\r\npretended that most of the extravagant things done by the Hussars,\r\nwas owing to Baggot. They immediately fell to work to collect the\r\nremains of the Levy money. And now they had a new contrivance to force\r\nit. These fellows, the Hussars, went galloping about, and seized the\r\ngentlemen that were refractory, or their factor, or then the principal\r\ntenants, if none of the former could be found, and brought them in\r\nprisoners to Stonnywood and Baggot, the last of whom was sure to use\r\nthem very roughly. But most of the gentlemen absconded, and some of the\r\nfew they got stood out against all their bad usage, as particularly Mr.\r\nInnes, Factor to the Earl of Kintore. The Tenants which they seized had\r\nnot the money to give so they were obliged at length to let them go\r\nand made but very little of this method. The Hussars were vastly rude\r\nand expensive wherever they went, and failed not to pick up any horses\r\nas they come along that were remaining. But for all their roughness,\r\npeople that would venture to stand their ground, would sometimes get\r\nthe better of them. One instance of which was at New Dear when two of\r\nthem armed with pistols were taking a gentleman’s horse and money, the\r\nminister of the place[369] being only with the gentleman, and both of\r\nthem only with staves in their hands; the minister first knocked down\r\none of the fellows and the gentleman the other, and disarmed them both\r\nand set them off.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some of Fitzjames Dragoons land_\r\n\r\nThe Saturday before his Royal Highness came to town, a French ship\r\nlanded some of the Dragoons of Fitzjames’ Regiment at Aberdeen with\r\ntheir riding furniture.[370] There had come afore about the same time\r\nanother French ship with the money for the Pretender’s use, but the\r\nMaster thought it dangerous to land it at Aberdeen as the Duke was\r\nso near, and so sailed about for Peterhead where it was received by\r\nLonmay.[371] Fitzjames’ Dragoons marched off next day, as did also\r\nStonnywood and his men with the Hussars, and thus the town of Aberdeen\r\nat length got free of the Rebel Government, after it had been about\r\nfive months subject to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Duke of Cumberland comes to Aberdeen_\r\n\r\nThe Tuesday thereafter General Bland arrived in town with the van of\r\nthe Army under the Duke of Cumberland, and his Royal Highness on the\r\nThursday thereafter. The Burgesses lined the streets all the way from\r\nthe Duke’s entry into the town to his lodgings. He was immediately\r\nwaited on by the nobility and gentry of town and county, and next day\r\nby the Colleges and Clergy who had assembled in a Synod _pro re nata_\r\nand had all the honour to kiss his hand. Mr. Osborne, Principal of the\r\nMarischal College, made a short congratulary speech to his Highness\r\nin name of the colleges, as did Mr. Theodore Gordon, Moderator of the\r\nSynod in name of the Clergy, and both had gracious returns.\r\n\r\n\r\n_More of Fitzjames’ Dragoons land in Buchan_\r\n\r\nSoon after this another of the Transports with Fitzjames’ Dragoons\r\nhaving got information on the coast, of the Duke’s being at Aberdeen,\r\nlanded in Buchan[372] and then very narrowly escaped from the Duke’s\r\nPicquets who were ordered out to intercept them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord Ancrum[373] marches to Curgaff_\r\n\r\nAs to Lord Ancrum’s expedition to Curgaff, a house belonging to\r\nForbes of Skeleter in Strathdon (vid. _London Gazette_, March 11th),\r\nGlenbucket was then with a few men within a few miles of Strathdon. But\r\nhis numbers were greatly magnified, and his being actually at hand was\r\nso artfully insinuated to a minister’s wife in the neighbourhood, that\r\nwith the honestest intention in the world, she gave a false alarm which\r\nmade his Lordship in such a hurry that though he destroyed the powder,\r\nyet he only scattered the ball, broke a few of the arms, and carried\r\noff a very few, the rest falling all into the hands of the country\r\npeople. And yet one might imagine that, as his dragoons were not to\r\ngallop off and leave the Foot, there had been no miss in making them\r\ndismount and walk for a few miles and loading their horses with the\r\nArms, till they should come to some place where country horses might\r\nhave been got.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bland[374] at Old Meldrum_\r\n\r\nWhen part of the army under General Bland advanced to Old Meldrum,\r\nBarrels and Price’s under Lieutenant Rich[375] lay at Inverury which\r\nis on the ordinary Post Road to Strathboggy (where about 3000 of the\r\nRebels under Roy Stuart were with the Hussars) and about 100 Grants\r\nthat came to escort their Laird to Aberdeen[376] formed an advance\r\nguard on this road, as the Campbells did from Old Meldrum, where they\r\nwere very alert and watchful, so that the Rebels never once offered to\r\ndisturb either the Generals or Lieut. Rich’s Quarters. And indeed if\r\nthey had, all possible care was taken to give them a warm reception.\r\nThere was a bridge of boats thrown over the Ury on the road from\r\nInverury to Old Meldrum, and a Guard midway betwixt the two Garrisons\r\nwho could observe a blaze in the night time at either of them or\r\nanything happening extraordinary, and by a blaze could give information\r\nof it to the other, and the Light Horse, too, were quartered betwixt so\r\nas to form a line of communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rebels attempt to surprise the Grants_\r\n\r\nThe night before General Bland marched for Strathboggy, the Grants\r\ncame first to the Kirk Town of Clate, which is about six miles south\r\nof Strathboggy and off from the high road to Aberdeen. As there were\r\nmany disaffected people thereabouts, the Rebels at Huntly had notice\r\nof it that night, though it was late before they came there, and they\r\nimmediately formed a scheme of surprising him next morning. But Grant,\r\nsuspecting such a thing might be done, wisely advanced a mile further\r\nthe same night to Castle Forbes, a house belonging to Lord Forbes, and\r\nby the strength of its old walls alone not easily to be taken without\r\ncannon, so that next morning when the Rebels under Roy Stuart missed\r\nthem at Clate, they returned without meddling with the Castle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bland marches to Huntly_\r\n\r\nMeantime General Bland had kept his orders for marching that morning\r\nso very closely that the Rebels had not got the least intelligence\r\nof it. The two corps from Inverury and Old Meldrum met at Rayne, and\r\nhad it not been for a small accident, had intercepted the Rebels who\r\nwere on the Clate Expedition and got to Strathboggy before them. For\r\nthey, dreaming of no such thing, breakfasted very leisurely at Clate\r\nand stopped also at a public house betwixt it and Huntly. There was\r\nan exceeding great fog on the Hill of the Foudline, so that some\r\nsenseless, idle people that were running up before the army, imagined\r\nthat a plough that was going in the midst among some houses on the side\r\nof the hill, was a party of men; on which they gave the alarm that\r\nthe Rebels were at hand, this was immediately forwarded by the liger\r\nLadys[377] with a deal of consternation, so that some people of better\r\nsense gave credit to it and came up to the General with this false\r\nalarm. Whatever might be in it, he judged it safest for the men to halt\r\nand form, while proper persons were sent up to see what the matter was,\r\nwho soon found out the mistake. But this trifle occasioned a stop for\r\nnear half an hour or three quarters, and the Rebels were scarce so long\r\nin Strathboggy before the General came there.\r\n\r\nThe Enemy knew nothing of them till they came within sight of\r\nStrathboggy. They had but just come there, and ordered dinner, but\r\nthey thought proper to leave it in a great hurry on Bland’s approach.\r\nTheir Hussars and some gentlemen on horseback brought up the rear.\r\nAmong these last, was Hunter of Burnside,[378] who for a good way kept\r\nwithin speech of the party under Major Crawford and the volunteers that\r\npursued them; but managed his horse with so much dexterity, turning\r\nso oft and so nimbly, that they could not aim at him rightly; at\r\nlength one of the Campbells shot so near him as made him start aside\r\nand gallop off, and as the forces took him for Roy Stuart, this gave\r\noccasion to the story of that gentleman being either killed or wounded.\r\nThe soldiers were incensed, and not unjustly with a notion that\r\nStrathboggy was extremely disaffected: coming in to it therefore under\r\nthis impression after a long march in a bitter bad rainy day, it was no\r\nsurprise that they used some freedom with a few peoples houses, who,\r\nconscious of their own demerit, had locked their doors and run off,\r\nleaving nobody to care for the soldiers that were to quarter in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Captain Campbell surprised at Keith[379]_\r\n\r\nNext day the General sent up seventy Campbells, and 30 Light Horse to\r\nKeith, a little town six miles from Huntly, and half way betwixt it\r\nand Fochabers where the Rebels had retired. One Alexander Campbell,\r\na Lieutenant, had the command, who had been all along very alert\r\non the advanced guard and had met with no check, though oft in as\r\ndangerous a situation, but next night had the misfortune to have his\r\nparty surprised. This was chiefly owing to the dissaffection of the\r\ninhabitants, who conducted the Rebels at dead of night, not by any\r\nset road, but through the fields so as not to meet with the Patroles,\r\nand then having fetched a compass about, and entering the town on the\r\nsouth, by the way from Huntly, were mistaken by the Sentrys, to whose\r\ncalls they answered in a friendly way, for a reinforcement they had\r\nsome expectation of. The Guard was conveniently posted in the Church\r\nand church yard which was very fencible, and the Lieutenant, who had\r\nnot thrown off his clothes, on the first alarm ran out and fought his\r\nway into them, and behaved very gallantly with his guard for a while.\r\nBut the rest of his men, being mostly all taken asleep, and having\r\nhimself received several wounds, he was at last obliged to surrender.\r\nThe enemy suffered considerably, but carried off their slain, so that\r\ntheir numbers were not known. The Lieutenant was left a while with only\r\none Sentry to guard him, on which he very resolutely grappled with him,\r\ndisarmed him and got off; but being retarded by his wounds he was soon\r\nretaken and then they hashed him miserably and left him for dead; yet\r\nhe afterwards recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Popish and Nonjurant Meetings destroyed_\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness on coming to Aberdeen immediately stopped all the\r\nNonjurant Ministers, and soon after ordered their Meeting Houses and\r\nthe Mass Houses to be destroyed, which was accordingly executed both\r\nin town and country as the Army marched along, and indeed none were\r\nsurprised at this piece of discipline, as these houses were not only\r\nillegal, but had in fact proved such Nurseries of Rebellion. The\r\nPriests had mostly gone off, and such as could be got were seized and\r\nconfined, but neither ministers nor people of the Nonjurants met with\r\nany other disturbance unless they were otherways concerned in the\r\nRebellion. The Army also had orders to seize the Corn, Horses, and\r\ncattle and Arms belonging to those in the Rebellion, but to touch none\r\nof their other effects, and the generality of the Rebels had foreseen\r\nthis and either sold or sent off these things, so that there were\r\nbut few that suffered much in this way. If any parties of soldiers\r\nused further freedom in these houses, which was not oft, the Duke,\r\non complaint made, not only obliged the Officers to be at pains to\r\nrecover the plundered effects from the soldiers, but generally gave a\r\ncompliment himself to make up the loss; as particularly to Mrs. Gordon,\r\nCupbairdy,[380] he ordered £100 Sterling. His protections were easily\r\nobtained till a piece of the Rebels extravagance not only made this\r\nmore difficult, but also obliged his Royal Highness to recall some\r\nprotections he had granted, and gave up some houses to be plundered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cullon House plundered by the Rebels_\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Findlater was at Aberdeen attending his Royal Highness,\r\nwhen his factor gave him notice that the Rebels who were thereabouts\r\nhad intimated, that if the Cess and Levy money for his Lordships\r\nEstate was not paid against such a day, his house at Cullon would\r\nperemptorily be plundered. This intimation the Earl showed to his\r\nRoyal Highness, who ordered him in return to certify them that if they\r\ntook such a step, it would oblige him to alter his conduct, recall his\r\nprotections and give up their houses to be plundered. Notwithstanding\r\nthis threat, the Rebels actually pillaged Cullon House[381] at the\r\ntime appointed, and his Royal Highness was in consequence obliged to\r\nwithdraw his protections from Lady Gordon of Park,[380] and Lady Dunbar\r\nof Durn,[380] for their houses; and indeed the last of these suffered\r\nconsiderably, but most of the effects were carried off from Park that\r\nwere of any value.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thornton Disgusted_\r\n\r\nThe famous Squire Thornton[382] who had raised the Yorkshire Company,\r\nhis Lieutenant Mr. Crofts, and Ensign Mr. Symson, Minister at Fala (who\r\nhad been both taken prisoners at Falkirk), had come as volunteers with\r\nthe Army to Aberdeen, though they had never met with very civil usage\r\nfrom the regular officers who seemed not at all to affect volunteers.\r\nWhen Pultney’s Regiment was ordered from Old Meldrum to Buchan on a\r\ncommand one day, these gentlemen who declined no fatigue, and had\r\nusually joined that corps, marched along. But coming the first night\r\nto a little village called Ellon, the Quarter Master would not assign\r\nQuarters to the volunteers as Officers, and none of the Officers\r\nwould give orders for it, which and some other things of this kind\r\neffectually disgusted them, so that they immediately left the army\r\nand returned home. His Royal Highness in order to preserve the town\r\nof Aberdeen from any surprise after he should leave it caused fortify\r\nGordon’s Hospital and placed a garrison in it under Captain Crosby, and\r\nin honour of the Duke it was called Fort Cumberland.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Duke marches from Aberdeen on Foot_\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke marched from Aberdeen[383] he endeared himself\r\nexceedingly to the soldiers (if it was possible to increase their\r\naffection for him) by walking most of the way with them on foot,\r\ngenerally using one of the soldiers Tenttrees for a staff and never\r\ngoing a yard out of the way for a bridge or any burn they met with, but\r\nwading through at the nearest.\r\n\r\nOn a long march of near 20 miles from Old Meldrum to Banff the\r\nfollowing little accident much delighted the spectators. A soldiers\r\nwife carrying a young child, grew quite faint and entreated her\r\nhusband, who was near with the Duke, to carry the child for a little\r\nway; the fellow said he could not as he was burdened with his arms. The\r\nDuke overheard, took the soldier’s gun and carried it himself for some\r\nway and ordered him to ease the poor woman of the child for a while.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rebels not expecting his March_\r\n\r\nThe Duke being stopped so long at Aberdeen, made his march at length\r\nas great a surprise on the Rebels as if he had not halted a day, for\r\nby this time they were grown very secure. The Duke of Perth, Lord John\r\nDrummond, Roy Stuart, etc., were all lodged in the minister’s house\r\nof Speymouth, and had more than 2000 men along with them. They were\r\nsitting very securely after breakfast, when a country man came over\r\nthe River in great haste and told them that the Enzie was all in a\r\n‘vermine of Red Quites.’[384] But they were so averse to believe it,\r\nthat when they ran to an eminence and observed them at a great distance\r\nthey swore it was only muck heaps: the man said it might be so, but he\r\nnever saw Muck heaps moving before. And after they were convinced it\r\nwas a body of men, still they would only have it to be some of Bland’s\r\nparties, till their Hussars, whom they had sent over to reconnoitre,\r\nreturned and assured them the whole Army under his Royal Highness was\r\ncoming up.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Duke crosses the Spey_\r\n\r\nAs to the Duke’s passing the Spey (vid. _London Gazette_, April\r\n19th):--The Soldiers had got a notion that all on the other side Spey\r\nwere rank Rebels, and so immediately seized a number of the sheep\r\nand other cattle as soon as they got over. But as the case was quite\r\notherways and the people of that Parish had been longing for the Army\r\nas their deliverers, on the minister’s representing this, and what\r\nhad happened, to his Royal Highness, he immediately ordered all to be\r\nrestored that could be got unkilled, and gave the minister £50 Ster.\r\nto divide among the people for their loss, and if that did not do it\r\ndirected him to demand whatever would, and it should be ordered. His\r\nRoyal Highness took up his quarters in the minister’s, where the Duke\r\nof Perth, etc., had been but a few hours before.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aberdeen Militia_\r\n\r\nImmediately after the Duke’s leaving Aberdeen the two towns raised\r\nseveral companies of Militia to prevent their meeting with disturbance\r\nfrom any flying parties. His Royal Highness named their Officers and\r\ngave them authority to act. He also named twelve Governors to have the\r\ndirection of the N. Town, till they should be allowed to choose regular\r\nMagistrates. There was also a proposal for raising a County Militia,\r\nbut the Duke’s victory at Culloden made it to be dropped as useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ancrum, Commander in Chief_\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Ancrum came to Aberdeen soon after the defeat of the Rebels\r\nas Commander in chief between Tey and Spey. Mark Kerr’s Dragoons\r\nwere along the coast, Fleeming’s Regiment at Aberdeen, and garrisons\r\ndetached from it to several places on Deeside, and Loudon’s under Major\r\nMcKenzie at Strathboggy, with garrisons at Glenbucket, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Houses burnt and plundered_\r\n\r\nParties were immediately sent out through the country in search of\r\nRebels, with orders also to plunder and burn their houses.[385] This\r\nsevere order was not at all agreeable to Friends of the Government,\r\nwho could in no shape relish Military execution, especially after the\r\nenemy was so effectually subdued. But it was not universally executed;\r\nmost of the Rebel Gentlemen’s houses on Deeside were plundered, and\r\nsome burnt, but these last were houses of little value and really no\r\nconsiderable loss to the proprietors. There was very little plundered\r\nin Buchan, some things only picked up by the soldiers in their searches\r\nunknown to the Officers. No Gentlemen’s houses were burnt, and only\r\none or two farmers’ by a worthless fellow not concerned with the army,\r\nwho by mighty pretences of zeal, had been employed by Ancrum to go\r\nwith five or six of Loudon’s Regiment, in quest of Rebels. There were\r\nno houses burnt or plundered in or about the towns of Aberdeen; but a\r\nTenant’s house in the land of Stonnywood, who had been very insolent.\r\nGlenbucket’s house was burnt in Strathdawn, as were also a tenant’s\r\nhouse or two about Strathboggy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order for Arms_\r\n\r\nLord Ancrum’s orders for bringing in of arms were very extraordinary,\r\nand indeed cannot be better exposed than by giving them and Lord\r\nLoudon’s in the same place, vid. _Scots Mag._ for July, p. 339.[386]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ill Conduct of the Soldiers_\r\n\r\nMost of the Officers of Fleeming’s Regiment were but young men, and\r\ndid not at all behave in an agreeable manner. They seemed too much to\r\nlook on the Army as a community of separate interests from that of the\r\nNation, and it was the common axiom of those even in highest command in\r\nAberdeen, that no laws but the Military were to be regarded. They took\r\nit in their heads to despise all in civil capacity, and especially as\r\nmuch as possible to thwart the Governors of the town in every thing.\r\nThey had no manner of confidence either in the gentlemen of town or\r\ncountry, not even in those who had merited so well for their zeal for\r\nthe Establishment; such as Mr. Middleton of Seaton, Mr. Burnet of\r\nKemnay, etc., nay, some of them were on many occasions ill used by\r\nthem. The Clergy of the Church of Scotland, for as much as they courted\r\nand applauded them in time of danger, were now their common subject for\r\nridicule; and a deal of spleen was shown against them, that it should\r\nbe thought they had in the least merited well of their country, and\r\nthus should have a title to some regard as well as the Military, and\r\nnot the least pendicle of the Army, a Commissary of foraging Clerks,\r\netc., but would have more regard paid to their representative than any\r\nClergyman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_People Disgusted_\r\n\r\nSuch was the injudicious conduct of the Lord Ancrum and most of\r\nthe officers of this Corps, which soon raised great disgust and\r\nheartburning. The Officers only, associated with one another, were\r\nseldom troubled with any advice from anybody of consequence acquainted\r\nwith the country; or if they were, were sure to slight it. This\r\ngave infinite satisfaction to the Jacobites who rejoiced in these\r\ndissensions. It was this mutual disgust which on the one hand provoked\r\nthe soldiers in so riotous a manner to break almost the whole windows\r\nin the town for not being illuminated on the first of August,[387] when\r\nthe towns people had no reason to think Illuminations would be expected\r\nof them; and on the other hand provoked the townsfolks to resent it\r\nso highly, for had there been a good understanding betwixt the Corps\r\nand them, such an outrage would probably not have been committed, or\r\nif some illegal things had been done they’d as probably have been\r\noverlooked, or at least easily atoned for.\r\n\r\nImmediately after this, Ancrum was removed and Lord Sempile[388]\r\nsucceeded him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRUE ACCOUNT OF MR. JOHN DANIEL’S PROGRESS WITH PRINCE CHARLES EDWARD\r\nIN THE YEARS 1745 AND 1746 WRITTEN BY HIMSELF\r\n\r\n\r\n_The manuscript preserved at Drummond Castle from which this Narrative\r\nis printed bears the following docquet:_--\r\n\r\n    This is to certify, that I believe the aforegoing Narrative to\r\n    be a correct Copy of the Original, written by my late Friend,\r\n    Captain John Daniel, which I have frequently seen and read,\r\n    and conversed with him, on the subject of its contents: more\r\n    particularly as to the facts of the Duke of Perth’s death, on his\r\n    passage from Scotland to France, on board the ship in which the\r\n    said Captain Daniel was also a passenger. To which conversations,\r\n    I can conscientiously depose if required.\r\n\r\n    Witness my hand at Exmouth Devon. This 25th day of September 1830.\r\n\r\n    R. B. GIBSON.\r\n\r\n    Signed in the presence of\r\n    HERBERT MENDS GIBSON,\r\n    Atty. at Law.\r\n\r\n    [NOTE.--The notes in this narrative which are indicated by\r\n    asterisks are written on the Drummond Castle manuscript in a\r\n    later hand.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRUE ACCOUNT OF MR. JOHN DANIEL’S PROGRESS WITH PRINCE CHARLES\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Fortune, or rather Providence, has screened, conducted and brought\r\nme safe out of so many miseries and dangers; gratitude obliges me to\r\nbe ever-thankful to that Omniscient Power, by whose particular bounty\r\nand goodness I now live, and survive a Cause, which, though it be now\r\na little sunk, will, I doubt not, one day or other, rise again, and\r\nshine forth in its true colours, make its Hero famous to after-ages,\r\nand the Actors esteemed and their memory venerable. But since it is not\r\npermitted to pry into futurity, we may at least take a retrospective\r\nview of our own or others’ actions, and draw from them what may amuse,\r\ninstruct or benefit human Society, and by that means fulfill in some\r\nmeasure the end for which we were sent into this world. Conceiving\r\nit therefore to be the best method of shewing my gratitude to Divine\r\nProvidence, I shall give a short but true account of what happened\r\nto me during the time I had the honour of being a soldier under the\r\nbanner of a most beloved Prince; hoping that the indulgent reader,\r\nwhom curiosity may induce to peruse the following pages, will pardon\r\nthe simplicity and ruggedness of my style, which, I am afraid, will be\r\nthe more strikingly conspicuous, as, in order to preserve the thread\r\nof my History unbroken, I have occasionally been obliged to interweave\r\nwith my narrative some extracts from the Memoirs of another, whose\r\nexcellence totally eclipses my humble attempt.\r\n\r\nThe lessons of loyalty, which had been instilled into me from my infant\r\nyears, had made a deep and indelible impression upon my mind; and as I\r\nadvanced towards maturity, and my reasoning faculties were developed,\r\nI became so firmly convinced of the solidity of the principles which\r\nI had been taught, that, when arrived at the age of Twenty-two, I\r\nresolved never to deviate from them, but to act to the best of my\r\npower the part of a good and faithful subject, notwithstanding the\r\ncustoms of an unhappy kingdom to the contrary. Nor was it long before\r\nan opportunity presented itself of proving my fidelity to my lawful\r\nSovereign; viz., when the Prince entered triumphantly into Lancashire\r\non the 24th of November 1745,[389] attended by about four thousand\r\narmed men. The first time I saw this loyal army was betwixt Lancaster\r\nand Garstang; the brave Prince marching on foot at their head like a\r\nCyrus or a Trojan Hero, drawing admiration and love from all those who\r\nbeheld him, raising their long-dejected hearts, and solacing their\r\nminds with the happy prospect of another Golden Age. Struck with this\r\ncharming sight and seeming invitation ‘_Leave your nets and follow\r\nme_,’ I felt a paternal ardor pervade my veins, and having before my\r\neyes the admonition ‘_Serve God and then your King_,’ I immediately\r\nbecame one of his followers. How, and in what manner, I am now going to\r\nrelate.\r\n\r\nThe brave and illustrious Duke of Perth (whose merits it would require\r\nthe pen of an angel properly to celebrate, being a true epitomé of all\r\nthat is good) halting to refresh himself at a Public-House upon the\r\nroad, where with some friends of mine I then happened to be; His Grace,\r\nbeing truly zealous in the cause, asked of them the disposition of the\r\nplace and people. They replied, that they believed it to be much in\r\nthe Prince’s favour. After some conversation on one thing and another,\r\nthe Duke did me the honour to invite me to join; which request being\r\nnowise contrary to my inclination, I immediately answered His Grace,\r\nthat I was exceeding willing to do anything that lay in my power for\r\npromoting the Prince’s interests, in any situation he might judge most\r\nproper. Upon this, the Duke honoured me with a most sincere promise\r\nof his particular patronage; and not a little proud I was of acquiring\r\nsuch a friend on my first joining the Prince’s army, in which I had not\r\nbefore a single acquaintance. After some questions, the Duke desired me\r\nto get in readiness and to meet him on horse-back at Garstang; which\r\nin about two or three hours I accordingly did. The army being then in\r\nfull march for Preston, the Duke desired me to go with forty men round\r\nthat part of the country which I best knew; which forty men being\r\naccordingly put under my command, I went to Eccleston and Singleton in\r\nthe Fyld Country, where I delivered some commissions, and caused the\r\nKing to be proclaimed, the bailiffs, constables and burgesses of the\r\nplace attending at the ceremony. I dispersed several of the Prince’s\r\nManifestoes; and Exhortations were made, in order to shew the people\r\nthe misery and oppressions of tyranny and usurpation, which like oxen\r\nyoked down to the plough, they seem to labour under; and calling upon\r\nthem to rise up and, like lions to shake off the infamous yoke which\r\ntoo long had galled the necks of free-born Englishmen;--to assert\r\ntheir liberties honourably both before God and Man, and to prove to\r\nthe world, that they remained true English hearts, equal to their\r\nfore-fathers’, who once had given laws to foreign States;--to exert\r\ntheir liberties under a Prince, who was come for their sakes, and for\r\ntheir sakes only, and with their concurrence would make them most\r\nhappy. But alas! notwithstanding all our proposals and exhortations,\r\nfew of them consented to join the Prince’s army. Therefore, having\r\nassembled those who did come in, orders were given for them to give\r\nup all their arms; which being reluctantly complied with, search was\r\nmade in several houses, where we found a few; and amongst the rest we\r\nentered the house of an honest Quaker, whom I had seen about ten days\r\nbefore at a Public-house, where he accidentally came in whilst I was\r\nthere, bringing with him a gun and a pair of pistols, which he had\r\nbought. Calling for his pot of ale, he began to harangue the host and\r\nthe others present, telling what an honest man the Justice of the\r\nParish said he was, and that he could keep all the Papists quiet. And\r\nwith these, said he (meaning the pistols) I can bid defiance to half\r\na hundred of Rebels. I then heard him with great pleasure, thinking I\r\nshould have the satisfaction of trying the honest Quaker’s courage;\r\nwhich accordingly happened. For, meeting with him at his own house, I\r\ndemanded of him, if he had any arms. Not knowing me directly, he said\r\nhe had none, and that he was not a man of blood. Vexed at this evasive\r\nanswer, I replied: ‘Hark thee, my honest friend, since nothing but an\r\naction with thy own weapons will get thy arms from thee, rememberest\r\nthou in such a place to have boasted much of thy courage, with a gun\r\nand a pair of pistols?’ At which being much struck and hanging down\r\nhis head he seemed greatly terrified. ‘How now,’ said I, ‘honest\r\nFriend, thou that wast so lately so pot-valiant, where now is thy\r\nboasted courage?’ ‘Pardon me,’ he then said, ‘I humbly beg, and I shall\r\nmost willingly deliver up the arms; for I have done much amiss.’ I\r\naccordingly took the arms from him, and went off, much pleased with the\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\nAll these things being now effected, on the days after I had first\r\nseen His Grace the Duke of Perth, we began our march for Preston; and\r\non the road, passing by a house of a person, who had in the year 1715\r\nbeen the chief cause of my Father’s misfortune, I turned my horse in\r\norder to have hanged the man and certainly would have done it, had not\r\nmaturer thoughts intervened, and stopt my revengeful rage. Continuing\r\nour journey, we arrived at Preston about 2 o’clock in the afternoon,\r\nhaving with us 39 English Recruits, whom I presented to His Grace the\r\nDuke of Perth, giving him an account of what had passed. At first\r\nhe seemed to be somewhat concerned; but, recollecting himself, he\r\nafterwards welcomed me back, and said, he doubted not soon to see a\r\ngreat joining, and desired me to come to him the next day--for the Army\r\nhalted two days at Preston. So, taking leave, I went to see some of my\r\nfriends in the Town; and, amongst the rest, to acquaint my Father with\r\nwhat I had done. He approved much of it, and gave me very salutary\r\nadvice, telling me always to have the love and fear of God before me,\r\nand never to deviate from my duty, but to act to the best in my power\r\nthe part of a brave soldier, and never to deject but comfort all those\r\nI found in misery. He then said to me, that as the infirmities of old\r\nage no longer permitted him to espouse so good a cause, in which he had\r\nonce been actively engaged, he would continually invoke the Almighty\r\nfor our success and preservation. So kissing me, he gave me his kind\r\nbenediction: and with the viaticum in my pocket I took leave of the\r\ntenderest of Fathers and best of Parents.\r\n\r\nIt being now the day on which the army marched from Preston, I waited,\r\naccording to appointment, on the Duke of Perth, who told me, if I\r\npleased, he would give me a Captain’s Commission in his Regiment; or,\r\nas one Mr. Gorogan[390] was to have a Colonel’s Commission over the\r\nEnglish, that I should have a Company under him, and command the men I\r\nbrought with me to Preston. The latter offer I accepted; and on being\r\nrecommended to the Colonel by the Duke, I was made Captain; and Captain\r\nLarrey,[391] now living at St. Omers, was the other Captain, with 3 or\r\n4 more. So we with the army began our march for Wiggan, where we were\r\njoined by a few more Loyalists. Having lain all night at Wiggan, we\r\nmarched the next day for Manchester. The ringing of the Bells, and the\r\ngreat rejoicings and salutations with which we were welcomed, gave us\r\nmighty expectations. But too true is the saying: _Parturiunt Montes,\r\nnascetur ridiculus mus_.\r\n\r\nWord was immediately brought to the Prince, that a number of men were\r\nat his service; and to please and content the Town, it was thought\r\nnecessary, that what men were raised at Manchester--vizt., the\r\nEnglish Regiment--should be called the Manchester Regiment, and all\r\ninferior Officers displaced as not being sufficiently Manchesterfied.\r\nHowever, regarding how matters went, I observed a little Man, by\r\nname Morgan,[392] deputed by the Prince with orders to inspect and\r\ncommission new Candidates, come into the room appointed for that\r\npurpose, and after salutations made, take his place at the head of the\r\nTable, with the Blackguard Dog[393] at his elbow, whether coming there\r\nby orders or impudence, I know not. Mr. Morgan began to tell the reason\r\nof his being sent, saying, that His Royal Highness was highly charmed\r\nat the report he had heard of the great number of Manchester men who\r\nwere to join his standard; and assured them all of his particular\r\nprotection, and of his willingness to grant them every favour in his\r\npower. This Declaration gave great joy to all present.\r\n\r\nA dispute then arose concerning the making of a new Colonel:[394]\r\nbut taking a dislike at some of their proceedings, I gave up all\r\npretentions to anything amongst them, and joined Lord Elcho’s\r\nGuards;[395] so the place was vacant. The rest however were called\r\nupon to be Regimental Captains, and so on, according as the aforesaid\r\npursuivant of Mr. Morgan notified: for, on demand who was to be the\r\nfirst Captain, all, conscious of each other’s merit, were silent;\r\ntill he, with a face of assurance, named such a man, for he had great\r\ninterest; after him, another, for he could raise a great number of men;\r\nand after him another, for he had great merit and power; till all the\r\nCaptain’s Commissions were disposed of according to his direction; and\r\nthen, looking about him, he said of the rest, it was hang choice which\r\nwas pitched upon first.\r\n\r\nThe Manchester Officers, being now formed, agreed to petition the\r\nPrince to stay another day there; which he agreed to in the expectation\r\nof raising a great number of men. I was as credulous as they: but was\r\nmuch surprised to see the next day those men whom I had brought from\r\nbehind Preston, and on the road thence to that place, enrolled for the\r\nmost part in the Manchester Regiment, and thus _Manchesterised_, if it\r\nmay be said so: and much troubled I was to see many of those men who\r\nhad followed me, had been paid out of my own pocket and been under my\r\ncare till our arrival in Manchester, disposed of, nay taken away from\r\nme in that manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quos Ego--sed motos praestat componere fluctus._\r\n\r\nHowever, being willing to be as useful as possible to the cause, I\r\nacquiesced in whatever they thought proper. The Prince, tho’ again\r\nrequested to stay, being weary of delay to no purpose, ordered the\r\nfollowing day the army to make a short march, and gave leave to the\r\nManchester Regiment to stay a day longer to get more recruits, on\r\npromise to march up to the army the day after: which we did; but our\r\nstay was not productive of much benefit.\r\n\r\nThe Comand of the Army, which till then had been the Duke of Perth’s,\r\nwas at this time given to Lord George Murray.[396] The real cause of\r\nthis change I cannot pretend to divine: all I can say, is that the\r\nreceived opinion amongst us was that Lord George being looked upon as\r\na man, whose name would bear a greater sway in England, especially\r\namongst loyal Protestants, and help to efface the prejudice and notion\r\nof Popery and arbitrary Power, which some, though vainly imagined were\r\nrushing in like a torrent upon them; it was just proper to place the\r\nchief command in him: and the Duke of Perth, for the good of his King\r\nand Country, most readily resigned, shewing himself willing to promote\r\nthe cause in any station, and giving a notable example of a brave\r\nwarrior, willing to command and willing to obey. Whether there was any\r\nother secret reason, I must leave it for time to unfold.\r\n\r\nThe Army being now arrived at Congleton in Cheshire, nothing particular\r\nhappened there, except that a patrol took one Captain Wier, a famous\r\nspy,[397] with seven dragoons, who were feasting at a house some\r\ndistance off. This Wier was by birth a Scotchman, and had been\r\nemployed in many villanies, and having served the Court not only as\r\na spy upon us, but amongst other foreign Powers, had been promoted\r\nfor his diligence in this business. He was conducted back with us\r\nto Carlisle--how unfortunate for us, that he was not put to death,\r\nconsidering what he has since done!--but his life was saved through\r\nthe innate clemency of the Prince, though he merited the worst of\r\npunishments.\r\n\r\nOn the first of December we departed from Macclesfield, in order to\r\nmarch to Leek; where we staid all night, and marched the next day for\r\nDerby. All that morning it was rumored amongst us, that we should have\r\nan engagement as the enemy’s army was said to be lying about five\r\nor six miles from us at Newcastle and Stone in Staffordshire. So we\r\nmarched in the best order we could to receive them: and about eleven\r\no’Clock, having espied a party at some distance on the mountains, we\r\ndrew up in order of battle, and stood so for some time, and would have\r\nfought them: but perceiving it was a false alarm, we continued on our\r\nroute to Derby, where we arrived somewhat late and fatigued. But two\r\ndays’ repose sufficiently refreshed us.\r\n\r\nDerby is a large and handsome town. The heads of it were much terrified\r\nat our entrance, many of them having made large subscriptions to\r\nGovernment; and therefore had quitted their houses with the utmost\r\nprecipitation. It fell to my lot to be quartered in one of them, vizt.,\r\none Mr. Chambers. Coming in with my billet, I asked if I could lodge\r\nthere. The Steward immediately replied that I could--adding ‘And any\r\nthing we can do for you, shall be done: only pity us in our situation,\r\nwhich is most deplorable.’ At this wondering much what he meant, I told\r\nhim to be of good courage--that neither I nor any of us were come to\r\nhurt him or any one. Having thus abated the horrid notion they had of\r\nus, which was only capable of being conceived too hard for expression,\r\nbeing so very strange; he conducted me to the Housekeeper, who was\r\nalso in tears. She was somewhat seized with horror at the sight,\r\nthough my countenance was none of the roughest: but soon collected\r\nherself and made the same answer with the utmost feminine tenderness,\r\nputting themselves and the whole house under my mercy. I truly was much\r\nsurprised, for anything of this kind was quite new to me: however,\r\nafter pulling off my riding-coat and boots she conducted me into a fine\r\nroom; where, at entering, I perceived a number of jewels and watches\r\nlying confusedly up and down, and many things else in the utmost\r\nconfusion. I demanded, to whom they belonged, and what was the reason\r\nof their being so carelessly laid up. The housekeeper then began to\r\ntell me the whole affair--‘Sir,’ said she, ‘Mr. Chambers, the master of\r\nthis house, no enemy to you, has retired with his lady and family into\r\nthe country,’ ‘Why so?’ said I. ‘Not conscious,’ replied she, ‘of any\r\nthing particular against you, but out of fear of what the Highlanders\r\nmight do against him.’ She then begged, that I would have compassion\r\non them, and be their protector; which, after some short discourse,\r\nI promised, telling them, that what was consistent with reason, and\r\na countryman, they should always find in me. I then ordered all the\r\nthings that lay so confusedly thrown about, to be locked up, assuring\r\nthem, that nothing should be touched or broke open, unless with\r\nauthority. So for two days I ruled master there, and, I hope they will\r\ngenerously acknowledge, much to their content and satisfaction in that\r\nsituation of affairs--having preserved the Young Lady’s jewels from the\r\nhand of rapine, and hindered the house from being damaged.\r\n\r\nA rumor was here spread amongst us, that _Cumberland Will_ and\r\nLigonier[398] intended to give us battle; which I believe would have\r\nhappened, if we had marched a day or two more towards London. Every one\r\nprepared himself to act in the best manner the valiant Soldier. But the\r\nPrince’s Council judged it more proper to retire back into Scotland\r\nwithout risking a battle, and there to await the arrival of foreign\r\nSuccors. How far they acted amiss or well in this, I know not: but a\r\ngreat alteration was afterwards seen amongst us. The brave Prince at\r\nthat out of a generous ardour and Love to his country, wished he had\r\nbeen twenty feet under ground! but, notwithstanding all this, a march\r\nback was agreed upon, after we had halted two days at Derby. Here I\r\ncannot pass by an accident that happened somewhat ominous--though\r\nI am none of the most credulous--but thence we may date our first\r\nmisfortune. Great numbers of People and Ladies (who had come from\r\nafar to see the Prince), crowding into his room, overturned a table,\r\nwhich in falling overturned and broke the Royal Standard--soon after\r\nour return was agreed upon--so I leave the reader to judge and make\r\nhis reflexions on this. It would seem certain at least that Providence\r\nmiraculously concurs, while such and such things are carried on. Thus,\r\nwhen Moses held up his hands, Joshua prevailed; but when through\r\nweariness he in the least relaxed the Israelites had the worst of\r\nit. So perhaps it was, that our enterprise was not vigorously enough\r\npursued: and remarkable it certainly was, that the Royal Standard\r\nshould be broken immediately after our return was resolved upon.\r\n\r\nThe third day being come, our march was proclaimed; and we began our\r\nreturn,[399] wondering what it could forebode. About this time we\r\nheard of Lord John Drummond’s Regiment having landed in Scotland, and\r\nthat more troops were daily expected from France. Some few afterwards\r\ncame, but the whole, including the said Regiment, did not exceed Five\r\nHundred effective men--too small an assistance in the then state of\r\nour affairs![400] Soon after their arrival, Lord Lewis Gordon, being\r\njoined by the foresaid regiment, defeated Lord Loudon at Inverury, so\r\ncompletely dispersing his army, that it was rendered ineffective during\r\nthe remainder of the campaign.[401] This happened very luckily for us;\r\nfor if Lord Loudon had not met with a check, he would probably have\r\nbeen able to collect a strong army to cut off our retreat, or at least\r\ngive us a very warm reception on our return to Scotland. This news\r\ntherefore gave us great comfort; and we courageously continued our\r\nmarch to join the above mentioned troops (in number one thousand men)\r\nby the same road we travelled before. The English Army, being informed\r\nof our retreat, immediately pursued us; but we found the saying to\r\nbe very true ‘_A good pair of heels is worth two pair of hands_.’\r\nDiverting it was, to hear those bells, which before had rung for us,\r\nturn to ring for them; we sometimes going out at one end of a town,\r\nwhilst they were coming in at the other: and no less odd it was, to\r\nsee the Magistrates who had canted when the Prince was amongst them,\r\nimmediately after taking an opposite side, and cursing and detesting\r\nthose whom they had just before saluted with a Judas-kiss.\r\n\r\nThe Enemy, finding that they could not come up with us, resolved,\r\nthough very ungenerously to their own party, to endeavour to raise\r\nthe inhabitants of the towns through which we had to pass against us,\r\nby spreading false reports, that the Prince’s Army had been entirely\r\ndefeated, and that nothing remained for them but to exert themselves\r\nlike good subjects, and to suffer none of the fugitives to escape. This\r\nreport was believed in many of the towns: great rejoicings were made,\r\nand every man thought himself capable of knocking out a Rebel’s brains\r\nwith a club or a staff. Then you might see heroic valour displayed\r\namong cocks that never crowed but among hens upon their own dunghill.\r\nBut the malicious expectations of our enemies were disappointed; and\r\nwhat they had contrived for our ruin redounded much to our profit.\r\nNotwithstanding the mildness of the Prince during the march of his army\r\nthrough England, and though he had suffered no one to be oppressed, we\r\nheard betwixt Derby and Manchester, that the latter town had made great\r\nrejoicing, and had raised some men to stop us: but we soon made these\r\nmighty heroes tremble, and the town pay for their rash determination\r\nfor entering regularly and triumphantly, we shewed them we were not the\r\npeople they took us for, and convinced them, that our situation was not\r\nso bad as had been falsely reported.\r\n\r\nEvery one therefore, vexed to the very heart at being so deceived,\r\nbegan to lay upon the mob the fault of what had happened, and the Mob\r\non the Heads of the Place, so that discord and confusion arose among\r\nthem. The Piper, however was well paid for their dancing; for it cost\r\nthem five thousand pounds Sterling--scarcely a sufficient atonement\r\nfor their malice.[402] Here I cannot pass by mentioning a barbarous\r\ndeed perpetrated before we came to Manchester which shewed the innate\r\ncruelty of our enemies on the one hand, and our clemency on the other.\r\nA young English lad, who had joined the Prince, being somewhat before\r\nthe army, had through weariness laid himself down to rest under a\r\nhedge, and fallen fast asleep. He was soon perceived by a woman and\r\nher boy: and this cruel fiend immediately determined to murder him as\r\nhe lay sleeping like a lamb, conscious of no harm; she accordingly\r\nwith the assistance of her son cut the poor young man’s throat. The\r\narmy coming up soon after, we espied the mangled body in that shocking\r\ncondition; and on searching the next house adjacent, we found a young\r\nboy in bed much besmeared with blood, and trembling, who confessed the\r\nfact, and said that his mother was the chief author of it. They were\r\nboth taken into custody, and a report of the whole made to the Prince:\r\nbut he was against their being put to death, so that by a wonderful\r\nclemency they escaped the just reward of their crime.\r\n\r\nWe halted two days at Manchester, and on the third marched for Wiggan.\r\nWhen going out of the town, a gun was fired at the Prince by a villain,\r\nwho, mistaking him, shot at a Mr. Sullivan, and luckily missed him.\r\nSearch was made for him, but in vain--and no great matter for any thing\r\nhe would have suffered from us; for many exercised their malice merely\r\non account of the known goodness and clemency of the Prince, which\r\nhowever they would not have dared to do, if he had permitted a little\r\nmore severity in punishing them. The Army irritated by the frequent\r\ninstances of the enemy’s malice began to behave with less forbearance.\r\nAnd now few there were, who would go on foot, if they could ride; and\r\nmighty taking, stealing, and pressing of horses there was amongst us,\r\nfor none of us was ever sure of keeping his own. Diverting it was to\r\nsee the Highlanders now mounted without either breeches, saddle, or\r\nanything else but the bare back of the horse to ride on; and for their\r\nbridle, only a straw rope. In this manner we marched out of England,\r\nmany a good horse being brought in to give us a lift.\r\n\r\nDuring our march to Wiggan, and thence to Preston, nothing particular\r\nhappened; only the enemy continued to pursue us, yet we made no more\r\nhaste on that account. I met upon the road my old patron the Duke of\r\nPerth; who asking me how I did, and how I liked the service. I told\r\nhim ‘Very well!’ He then inquired ‘How I could bear the thought of\r\ngoing into Scotland’--and I immediately replied That I had ever been\r\ncurious to see that kingdom, and was proud of benefiting the cause,\r\nor occasion that was offered. His Grace was pleased to promise, that\r\nhe would recommend me to the Colonel, who, he doubted not, would be a\r\nfather to me; as it accordingly fell out. Marching on to Preston, we\r\nhalted there two days; and on the third in the morning, immediately\r\nafter we had quitted the town, the enemy took possession of it. On\r\nour arrival at Lancaster in the evening, I was recommended to Colonel\r\nElphinstone, afterwards Lord Balmerino,[403] who commanded the second\r\ntroop of the Prince’s Life Guards. Having equipped myself for that\r\npurpose when in Preston, I rode on somewhat before the Army, to be\r\nin readiness at Lancaster: but on the road, nine miles distant from\r\nthat place, alighting from my horse to refresh myself at a Public\r\nhouse, and leaving my horse two or three minutes at the door; he was\r\nimmediately taken away by some of the soldiers, and I entirely lost\r\nhim. Vexed I was to be served so; and having nine miles to walk in my\r\nboots sorely harrassed me. However, fortifying myself with patience,\r\nand premeditating revenge, I at last, though somewhat late got up to\r\nLancaster: and now being in great anxiety for a horse, being the next\r\nday to have the honour of riding in the Guards, I resolved to wait an\r\nhour or two till my servant Dick, a Yorkshire-Man, came up, and to\r\nmake use of his horse, till such time as I could get another. But his\r\narrival brought me little satisfaction; for, after he had refreshed\r\nhimself, and I had told him the misfortune that had happened to me, he\r\nwent out, and wrote me a few lines to the following purport:--\r\n\r\n    ‘DEAR MASTER,--I am truly sorry for your misfortune but I do not\r\n    much like the Army’s behaviour; neither can I think of going into\r\n    Scotland, and you know a Yorkshire-man coming home without a\r\n    horse is laughed at. Therefore not doubting but you can provide\r\n    yourself better than with this, I beg leave to be your Humble\r\n    Servant _Dick_, promising to rejoin you, when I see you in these\r\n    parts again.’\r\n\r\nHe left these lines with the landlord of the house to give me; which he\r\ndid about an hour after.\r\n\r\nSo, being served a true Yorkshire trick, I lost both man and horse.\r\nI bethought myself of applying to one Mr. Grant,[404] Colonel of the\r\nArtillery, thinking there might be a spare horse. When I had informed\r\nhim of what had happened, he promised that he would endeavour to\r\nprovide me with a horse the next morning, till he could buy or get\r\nanother; which kindness of his was very seasonable. But going down\r\nthe Castle-Hill, where the Artillery lay, I espied two Highlanders\r\nstealing a horse, and breaking down a pair of barn-doors. When they\r\nsaw me advancing towards them, one of them went, and the other stood\r\nguard. Now I thought this a good opportunity to provide myself: So I\r\nwent boldly in, and inquired whether Captain McDonald’s Horse were\r\nnot there; the man answered he knew not; at which taking courage, and\r\ngoing up to the horse, I demanded whose that was. He made me the same\r\nanswer. ‘Friend,’ said I, ‘if you do not, I do,’ and I immediately\r\ntook the horse, well pleased, that I had got a _Titt for Tatt_ (as\r\nthe Lancashire saying is). So returning to my lodgings with my prize,\r\nI repaired to wait upon Colonel Elphinstone, who received me very\r\ngraciously, having been spoken to before by the Duke of Perth. He\r\nwelcomed me among them, assured me of all that was kind and civil in\r\nhis power, and then invited me to sup with him. After thanking him,\r\nI accepted his kind invitation; and when I took my leave of him he\r\nrenewed his promises of kindness, and desired me to be in readiness to\r\nmount next morning at his quarters.\r\n\r\nAt this time the Yorkshire Hunters[405] endeavoured to shew themselves\r\nagainst us, but little to their honour. This was a regiment composed\r\nof the Yorkshire Gentlemen, many of whom mounted themselves and their\r\nservants on the best light horses they had, and gave themselves the\r\nfore-said name. As we were marching into Lancaster, these Hunters\r\nattacked some of our Light Horse in the rear: but finding they had\r\ncaught Tartars, they quickly retreated; and being pursued, some of\r\nthem were taken prisoners--so that _Yorkshire seemed to be put upon\r\nYorkshire_.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Prince’s Council resolved to despatch some one\r\nwith orders to Lord Lewis Gordon and Lord John Drummond, and the rest\r\nof the Prince’s adherents who were in arms, to meet us at Carlisle;\r\nand for this purpose the Duke of Perth set out attended by about\r\nOne-hundred Light-Horse. When they arrived at Kendal, the inhabitants\r\nof that place, seeing them come in great haste, judged they were flying\r\nfrom the battle and endeavouring to make their escape, assembled in a\r\ntumultuous manner, and, after insulting them, at last fired upon them\r\nout of the windows--and at going out of the town, a ball was fired at\r\nthe Duke of Perth in his Chaise, who, looking out courageously, noticed\r\nthe place it came from. Though the ball happily missed the Duke it shot\r\nCaptain Cameron’s horse. Being now out of the town, we resolved boldly\r\nto re-enter it, and quell that insulting mob. So, marching back, they\r\ntook the man who fired the fore-said ball, and killed two or three:\r\nyet this villain escaped with only a few blows from the gentleman\r\nwhose horse he had killed; though certainly he would have been put to\r\ndeath, had not the Duke interceded for him. The town of Kendal being\r\nthus appeased, we continued our route: but hearing that the Militia of\r\n_Pe[n]r[i]th_ and other places, thinking our Army had been cut off,\r\nhad risen, and were, in conjunction with the Hessians who had landed\r\nthereabouts,[406] intercepting the road they thought they were to pass;\r\nthe Duke resolved to pass by another in order to miss them. But his\r\nguide, instead of shewing the right way, conducted them upon the enemy;\r\nso that ascending the summit of the hill, they perceived their danger,\r\nbeing within gun-shot of a great body of both horse and foot, which\r\nunexpected sight struck a great panic amongst the Duke’s party. The\r\nDuke was for fighting his way through them: but Colonel Bagott,[407]\r\nColonel of the Hussars, was of another opinion, and he being seconded\r\nby some others, a retreat was agreed upon. The enemy immediately\r\ndispatched some of their Light-horse in pursuit of them: but the Duke’s\r\nparty retiring in good order, kept their pursuers, notwithstanding all\r\ntheir firing, at a good distance; and after being pursued five or six\r\nmiles, returned upon them with such vigour, that they took three or\r\nfour prisoners, rescued the Duke’s baggage, which had just before been\r\nseized, and made them retire faster than they had come. Finding it\r\nhowever in vain to pursue his enterprise, the Duke rejoined the Army.\r\n\r\nWe having staid all night at Lancaster, I went, according to\r\nappointment, to wait upon my Colonel, who, being mounted at the head\r\nof his troops, placed me in his corps. We were ordered that day to\r\nmarch in the rear of the army; and, as we left the town, the enemy\r\nimmediately took possession of it, and followed us some little way\r\nout, so that we did not directly know their intention. But, finding\r\nthey soon returned, we marched on (nothing particular happening) to\r\nKendal where we halted all night and made the town pay for its past\r\nbehaviour. We then continued our retreat in exceeding bad weather and\r\nroads to Carlisle: but by the severity of the season we were obliged\r\nto make a shorter march than we intended, and halt all night at a\r\nvillage called Shap, where we suffered very much on account of the bad\r\naccommodation it afforded. However staying there all night we assembled\r\ntogether early next morning. Some few of us got that night to Carlisle.\r\nBut I cannot pass by an affair that happened at Clifton which was as\r\nfollows:--The enemy’s advanced Guard, commanded by General Honeywood,\r\nhaving got somewhat before us, planted himself in ambush near the road\r\nwe were to march, and from behind the hedges expected, as the army\r\napproached to cut them off; but there the biter was bit: for though we\r\ncame unknowingly upon them, we had the good fortune to receive their\r\nattack in good order, killed and drowned many of them, and put the rest\r\nto flight: General Honeywood himself narrowly escaped, having lost his\r\narm, and severely wounded. This brave action was chiefly owing to the\r\ncourage of the McPhersons, commanded by Clued McPherson,[408] their\r\nChief, who behaved most gallantly on this occasion; and most pleasing\r\nit was, to see the champions come into Carlisle, loaded with the spoils\r\nof their enemies.[409]\r\n\r\nThe whole army being now in Carlisle, our thoughts lay for some time\r\nsuspended in order to act for the best; for we supposed that the enemy\r\nwould come and give us battle. I cannot say that we somewhat waited\r\nthem, but finding they did not, it was judged proper after two days’\r\nstay and deliberation, to continue our march farther North, and to\r\nleave at Carlisle the few English who were with the army and about\r\nthree hundred Scots. But of this proceeding I can say nothing farther,\r\nleaving to the world to judge as they think proper. The English then\r\nwere about two hundred men; for many had quitted and returned home\r\nbeing unwilling to go to Scotland. Now some there are, who censure the\r\nPrince for leaving them at Carlisle, thinking it was out of disregard\r\nand a desire of being rid of them: but if they will pry a little more\r\nnarrowly into the affair they will find, that it was the desire of\r\nMr. Townley Colonel of the English who not only petitioned the Prince\r\nin his own name, but in the name of all the officers of the Regiment,\r\nto be left there, though the latter never assented to or desired it,\r\nmany of them wishing to undergo the same fate as their Royal Master.\r\nHowever on Mr. Townley’s coming back and telling them that it was the\r\nPrince’s pleasure that they should remain at Carlisle, they all, taking\r\nit as coming from the Prince, most willingly acquiesced, shewing true\r\nEnglish bravery in any situation to obey:--and now, seeing themselves\r\ndeprived of the satisfaction of following him they so greatly loved,\r\nthey resolved to accompany him still in their hearts--all that was in\r\ntheir power. They shewed a true generosity in disposing of all that was\r\nnot of immediate use to them, viz., their horses and riding-equipage,\r\nto all who stood in need; and though I seemed somewhat picqued at them\r\nin the beginning of this Narrative, I must ingenuously own, that they\r\nwere a set of brave men; and though it is often objected to them, that\r\nthey were not of an extraordinary rank, yet they behaved so as to make\r\nthose of a nobler birth blush; for, from the time they had the honour\r\nof joining the Prince’s standard, they never sought pay either for\r\nthemselves or their men, honourably maintaining and supporting the\r\nRegiment themselves:--Unhappy Gentlemen! They merited a much better\r\nfate than what was awaiting them![410]\r\n\r\nEvery thing being now in readiness, we began our march, in order\r\n(alas! as it happened) to bid adieu to Old England for ever! On the\r\n22nd of December 1745[411] (being the Prince’s birthday) about four\r\no’Clock in the afternoon, we crossed the river Esk, which separates the\r\ntwo kingdoms. The deepness and rapidity of the river, joined to the\r\nobscurity of the night, made it most terrible: but the good Prince,\r\nhere, in particular, animated the men; and how noble was it to see\r\nthese Champions, who had refused him nothing now marching breast-deep,\r\none supporting another, till wonderfully we all passed safe. The Duke\r\nof Perth here signalized himself much by his goodness; for, crossing\r\nthe river several times on horseback, he took behind him several of the\r\ncommon Soldiers, whose strength was not sufficient to bear up against\r\nthe current. Nor was the Prince wanting in giving a notable specimen of\r\nhis generosity and condescension to his subjects, in imitation of the\r\nGreat Alexander, who, in his expedition into Persia, suffered a poor\r\nSoldier, much fatigued, to repose himself in the king’s chair, which\r\ntill then it had been death for anyone but himself to sit in. So the\r\nPrince I think, imitates, or fully equals, this great hero in point of\r\naffability to his men; for, taking on horseback a common soldier behind\r\nhim, he carried him over the water, giving us all a great example\r\nof goodness and courage to follow him. But at this river I narrowly\r\nescaped drowning; for in crossing it, and being near the middle of the\r\nstream I perceived two women (tho’ never an army was known with so few)\r\nrolling down it and in imminent danger of perishing if I did not guide\r\nmy horse in order to stop them: and I had like to have paid dearly for\r\nit, for coming against me, they laid hold of me in such a manner, that\r\nI was not able to dismount; and being so beset by the two women, and my\r\nhorse, who was none of the biggest, going down the stream with me, I\r\ngave myself up for lost. I did not, however, lose courage and conduct\r\nin managing my horse as well as I could; and perceiving a man mounted\r\nupon a very high horse wading where I was swimming, I called to him\r\nfor assistance. He seeing me in that piteous case, came immediately,\r\nand rescued me from the imminent danger I was in of perishing, and\r\nfreed me also with a great deal of difficulty from my two companions:\r\nbut how I got quit of them or out of the water, I remained an entire\r\nstranger; being come to the other side, I was immediately seized with\r\na great panic and trembling from the fright of the danger I had so\r\nnarrowly escaped, and in this state I continued for three or four hours\r\nnotwithstanding all the efforts I could make against it. That night\r\nhowever, being, as I said, on the other side, somewhat before the\r\nrest, I saw them come almost half round together with my deliverer, to\r\nwhom I did not fail to pay my most hearty thanks, as the poor women did\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nBut here let us stop and take a short View of the Army’s behaviour\r\nwhilst in England. It may be said, and is allowed even by the judgment\r\nof our enemies, that never such an army could be expected to behave\r\nas they did, giving the greatest marks of generosity to our enemies,\r\npaying for what they had, and revenging or oppressing few or none; and\r\nshewing to the World, that a noble design rather than either malice,\r\nrapine or plundering, was at the bottom of our proceedings. But as I\r\nmay perhaps be suspected of partiality towards them, I shall refer\r\nthe Reader to what was acknowledged by one of our greatest enemies,\r\nviz., one Parson Bissett in Aberdeen,[412] who was one of the heads\r\nof the Presbytery, and much esteemed by his own party for his morals\r\nand great talents as a preacher. This Gentleman, mounting the pulpit,\r\nsoon after we had left Aberdeen, and while Cumberland’s Army was there,\r\nbegan his Sermon with a comparison betwixt us and those then in town,\r\nsaying: ‘When the Prince, as they call him, was here,[413] I made it my\r\nbusiness night and day to inspect their conduct, and observe their most\r\nminute actions; and instead of finding subjects of complaint, I found\r\nmuch to the contrary, and drew honey whence I thought it was not to be\r\nextracted. I heard what they said and did; and I heard of no robbery,\r\nof no ill towards the people: but since these men are come amongst\r\nus, what is the secret that is not revealed? What is holy, that is not\r\npolluted? What’s forbid, that’s not transgressed? and in fine, where is\r\nGod or Man obeyed? Here, cursing and blaspheming; there Drunkenness,\r\nWhoredom and Debauchery are carried on in full career, and reign with\r\nunlimited sway.’ So, going on in this strain, he concluded by telling\r\nhis auditors, that it was a shame to be out-done by us; that, in\r\npunishment for their sins, nothing less than the curse of God could\r\nfall upon them, and make instruments of us to punish them.\r\n\r\nBut now I shall return again to the river Esk. Having wonderfully got\r\nsafe over, we marched all that night through excessively bad roads,\r\nall of us being very wet and cold, without any refreshment, except\r\nwhat we had before we left Carlisle, till ten o’Clock the next day,\r\nwhen we arrived at Dumfries; and extraordinary it was to see the Army,\r\nnotwithstanding all their fatigue, come in as merry and gay as if they\r\nhad only marched that morning. At our entrance into the Town, we saw\r\nthe great rejoicing that had been made for our defeat, the candles\r\nbeing still in the windows, and the bonfires unextinguished. And now it\r\nwas, that being in Scotland, my Colonel began to shew me great civility\r\nupon account of my being an Englishman, and so did afterwards several\r\nof the gentlemen of that country; for seeing me amongst them, they\r\nthought they could scarce do enough for me, especially my Colonel, who,\r\nfor fear of my being any time badly quartered, ordered that I should\r\nalways be lodged _chez lui_. So that from that time I had ordinarily\r\nhis quarters, and sometimes a part of his bed, when there happened to\r\nbe no other, so that I had every reason to be satisfied with my lot,\r\nhaving such resource of comfort in all my difficulties.\r\n\r\nAfter we had halted two days at Dumfries, and made them pay for\r\ntheir past behaviour,[414] we marched on for Hamilton; and here the\r\nPrince, attended by a few of his gentlemen, went to take the diversion\r\nof shooting in the Park; in which he behaved to the admiration and\r\nsurprise of all present, killing or hitting every thing he shot at,\r\nso that, without flattery, he was looked upon to be the best marksman\r\nin the army. After we had staid some time at Hamilton, we continued\r\nour march to one of the prittiest (but most whiggish) towns in all\r\nScotland, viz., Glasgow. Here we arrived on the 25th of December,\r\n1745, much to their confusion, and halted six or seven days.[415] That\r\nTown had given, when the Prince marched for England, five thousand\r\npounds for its good behaviour, and paid us now as much over again\r\nfor breaking the same, rebelling against us, and raising the Militia\r\nin our absence. So we taught them more wit, how to break their words\r\nanother time. The Army having been here provided with cloathing and\r\nother necessaries, of which they were very much in want, the Prince\r\nresolved to make a general inspection and review of them. Accordingly\r\norders were issued one morning for that purpose, for us all to repair\r\nto a place at a little distance from the Town. So we marched out with\r\ndrums beating, colours flying, bag-pipes playing, and all the marks\r\nof a triumphant army to the appointed ground, attended by multitudes\r\nof people, who had come from all parts to see us, and especially the\r\nladies, who before were much against us, were now, charmed at the sight\r\nof the Prince, become most loyal;[416] and many afterwards, when they\r\ncould not testify it to us by their good offices, did it in imitation\r\nin their hearts. I am somewhat at a loss to give a description of the\r\nPrince at this Review. No object could be more charming, no personage\r\nmore taking, no deportment more agreeable, than his at that time was,\r\nfor, being well mounted and princely attired,[417] having, too, great\r\nendowments both of body and mind, he appeared to bear a sway above\r\nany comparison with the heroes of the last ages, and the majesty and\r\ngrandeur he seemed to display most noble and divine. The Army being now\r\ndrawn up in all form, and every one putting himself out for the best,\r\nthe Prince rode through the ranks, greatly encouraging and delighting\r\nall who saw him. After the Review we returned again to Glasgow; and\r\nabout this time the unhappy news reached us, that Carlisle was invested\r\nby Cumberland, who, having got up cannon from Whitehaven, was in a fair\r\nway of taking it.\r\n\r\nIt being now judged proper to continue our march for Stirling, we\r\nquitted Glasgow in a handsome manner, and soon sat down before that\r\ntown, which we took after two or three days’ cannonading, and then\r\nbegan the siege of the Castle, having just received a few pieces of\r\nCannon from France, which would have been sufficient, as many are\r\npleased to say, if our Engineer, viz., one Mirabell,[418] a Frenchman\r\nby birth, had been good for any thing: but erecting our batteries\r\nin an improper place against the Castle, we spent three weeks’\r\nlabour in vain; during which time news arrived from Carlisle, by Mr.\r\nBrown,[419] who was left Lieutenant Colonel by the Prince, and one Mr.\r\nMaxwell,[420] who made their escape over the wall while the Articles of\r\nCapitulation were signing. These gentlemen acquainted us, that, after\r\nCumberland had lain six or seven weeks before the town, and heralds\r\nhad been frequently sent in to summons it to surrender, Mr. Hamilton,\r\nGovernor of the Castle had at last resolved to obey them but whether\r\nwith a true fear or promise of his life, is disputed. Certain however\r\nit is, that he employed that villainous Wier, whom I have mentioned\r\nbefore (being left a prisoner at Carlisle) with secret Messages to and\r\nfrom the enemy; and instead of hanging him, invited him daily to his\r\nown table. How far this conduct was good, I leave the world to judge.\r\n\r\nMr. Townley, Governor of the Town, being informed that the resolution\r\nto capitulate was taken, endeavoured, seconded by his whole corps,\r\nofficers and soldiers, to oppose him: but finding no means effective\r\nto hinder the place from being given up, he was obliged to send, by\r\nHamilton’s direction, articles of Capitulation to Cumberland, who\r\nreturned for answer That the Town and Castle should be surrendered\r\nat discretion, and that the Officers and Soldiers should be at his\r\nFather’s Mercy, with whom he promised to intercede for their safety.\r\nHow sincerely he behaved in this, is sufficiently known:[421] and when\r\nI reflect upon this, I think I may say I have good fortune, in leaving\r\nthat unhappy town and regiment, that I was not on some gallows or other\r\nmade a partaker also of his clemency! This news was at first hard to\r\nbe believed amongst us: but it appearing but too true, the Prince was\r\nexceedingly troubled, and lamented much the loss of his subjects,\r\nespecially the English, who were to be made sacrifices of; and also did\r\ngenerally the whole army, many of them wishing they had been there, nay\r\neven to be made victims of to Cumberland’s fury!\r\n\r\nWe had now scarce got well into the siege of the Castle, before news\r\ncame, on the other hand, that General Hawley was advancing towards us\r\nwith about eleven or twelve thousand men. The Prince’s Army at this\r\ntime amounted to about eight thousand effective men, having been joined\r\nby Lord John Drummond’s Regiment, and Lord Lewis Gordon’s, of whom I\r\nhave spoken before, and some few others. So, seeing we must inevitably\r\nfight we endeavoured to prepare ourselves in the best manner for that\r\npurpose. The enemy, we heard, were now come to Falkirk, which was only\r\neight or ten miles distant from us. We waited two days in expectation\r\nof their coming on to attack us: but finding that they continued at\r\nFalkirk, we on the third morning, leaving a sufficient force for the\r\nsiege of Stirling, boldly marched out in quest of them. And here it was\r\nthe soldiers shewed the greatest alacrity; the foot marching with such\r\ncelerity as kept the horse on a full trot, so that by two o’Clock in\r\nthe afternoon we came up with them, notwithstanding we almost marched\r\nround them, in order to have the wind somewhat favourable for us. And\r\nnow the day, from being an exceeding fine one, became on a sudden\r\nobscure; the sun which till then shone upon us, was now as it were\r\neclipsed, and all the elements in confusion, so that the heavens seemed\r\nto fulminate their anger down upon us, by the impetuous storm of hail,\r\nwind and rain, that fell just at the time of the engagement. The enemy\r\nat this time scarcely knew any thing of our march towards them till\r\nit had been almost too late; as they lay in an entire security and\r\ndefiance of us, thinking it not worth their while to take the necessary\r\nprecaution of having spies out, as other prudent Generals would have\r\ndone, notwithstanding the contempt they might have had for us. We now\r\nroused them out of their lethargy, being just upon them at their going\r\nto dinner. Cursing their bad fortune, they immediately mounted and\r\nturned out of their camp, somewhat in confusion to meet us, which they\r\ndid at a short distance from it, though not to our disadvantage.\r\n\r\nTheir cavalry was in front of their left wing, unsupported with foot;\r\nand their infantry in the right, unsupported by horse: but the day\r\nbeing so excessively bad, hindered their cannon from coming up, so\r\nthat we were upon an equal footing with them in that respect, we\r\nbringing none with us. We were about four hundred light Horse ordered\r\nto face the enemy’s dragoons, being fronted and supported by a strong\r\nline of _McDonells_; and our foot, with the Prince, against their\r\nfoot. Here I must acknowledge, that when I saw this moving cloud of\r\nhorse, regularly disciplined, in full trott upon us down the summit, I\r\ndoubted not but that they would have ridden over us without opposition\r\n(I mean the front line) and bear us down without difficulty in their\r\nimpetuous progress: but I soon found myself mistaken; for immediately\r\nupon our bearing upon them in order to meet them, there blew such a\r\nstorm of wind and hail, which was before on our side, and now turned\r\nmiraculously, as we turned, on our backs; and notwithstanding that\r\nalmost disabled us to bear up against them, it so harrassed the enemy,\r\nthat cursing and blaspheming was made the dying-speech of many of them.\r\nAnd now kind Heaven seemed to declare for us.\r\n\r\nThe brave front-line of _McDonells_ suffered the enemy to come within\r\nten or twelve paces of them before firing. Nobly altogether presented,\r\nand sent their benediction upon them, so that in the third part of a\r\nminute that rapid and impetuous torrent, which seemed in rolling to\r\nlay all waste before it, was now checked and stemmed in such a manner,\r\nthat it was made to retake its course faster than it had proceeded.\r\nUpon seeing this, we immediately seconded our work with a hearty huzza,\r\nvictory now declaring for us. But on the Prince’s wing it remained\r\nsomewhat more obstinate: yet soon after they returned the same, having\r\nhappily finished their affair with scarce the loss of forty men, and\r\nwe had only one wounded. We now pursued them sharply for about sixty\r\npaces, and fetched down a good many of them: but unfortunately being\r\nordered to halt, when a little further pursued would have finished\r\nour affair, we let an opportunity slip out of our hands, which never\r\nafterwards presented itself again. This piece of conduct belonged\r\nchiefly to Lord George Murray,[422] who would not permit the army to\r\npursue any farther. So being ordered to halt, we modestly bid our\r\nenemies retire, and as it were tell them to come better provided\r\nanother time. Here I could say something more: but I cannot at present;\r\ntherefore I’ll say nothing, leaving it to Midwife Time to say it for\r\nme, and contenting myself with halting with the army.\r\n\r\nAnd now after four or five hours’ halt, we heard, that we might go, if\r\nwe pleased, and take possession of the town. So the army was ordered\r\nimmediately to enter the town, and about eighteen of us Guards, who\r\nwere present, to go about three miles off, and take fifty-four of the\r\nenemy prisoners. When we arrived at the house, where they had got\r\ntogether they shut the door against us. We therefore surrounded the\r\nhouse, and summoned them immediately to surrender:--which they refusing\r\nat first to do, we fired into the house--and they immediately gave\r\nthemselves up to our mercy. So, after taking them and fifty-four stand\r\nof arms, we conducted them Prisoners into Falkirk that night. And\r\nhere it was, that I happened to perform an action which gave me great\r\ncomfort afterward in my distress.--A fine young boy, who was somewhat\r\nout of order, being found in the house after all was almost done, was\r\nespied by some of our party, who bringing him out asked who would take\r\ncare of him. I told them to give him to me, which they immediately did.\r\nThe young boy, being now in my possession, says to me: ‘I hope Your\r\nHonour will not kill me.’ Upon which, being a little surprised at what\r\nhe said, I asked him, ‘Have you not well merited it?’ ‘If I may be\r\npermitted to speak to Your Honour,’ replied he, ‘I own I am taken in\r\nan unhappy affair, which neither malice nor inclination drew me into.\r\nBut the Head of the Country, notwithstanding I was the only child of my\r\naged parents, insisted, under great penalties, on my coming in to join\r\nhim; so that I beg you will pity me in my condition: but if it must be\r\nthat I die this night, pray! tell me what death you think it will be?’\r\nUpon which, not knowing what to think or what to say, I was somewhat\r\nat a loss: his telling me of his aged parents, and his simplicity\r\ntouched me much: and how far I may be censured for my after-conduct, I\r\nknow not; but those who think I did amiss, I hope, will pardon me, as\r\nbeing then but a young warrior. True, such a thing, I know, ought not\r\nto have been publicly done; yet, when an opportunity presented itself\r\nof doing an Act of Mercy without harm to the Cause, I am convinced\r\nthat this my behaviour will, with all generous minds, escape reproof.\r\nThe young boy continuing his lamentations, I told him to be of good\r\ncourage, for death was not so imminent as he expected; at which he\r\nseemed to respire new vigor and life: And after some questions asked,\r\nand promises made of his ever being grateful and upon his telling me,\r\nthat his home was not above fourteen miles from thence, I asked him, if\r\nhe could privately slip away thither. He replied, such a favor would be\r\ntoo great for him to presume to request: So telling him to do it if he\r\ncould, I discharged him, ordering him to be a support to his poor aged\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nAnd now by this time we had almost conducted our prisoners to Falkirk;\r\nand, after delivering them, we went thoroughly wet and cold, to repose\r\nourselves a little while on straw, and some in the open fields or air,\r\nall places being by this time entirely filled, so that it was then\r\nimpossible to find any resource or ease for our excessive hunger, wet\r\nand cold. So resting a few hours in that condition, they soon after\r\nappeared; and when light, we went to see the field of the slain; and\r\nnumber being made of them, we found near seven hundred of the enemy\r\nslain, and about fifty of ours, which were immediately interred. But\r\nthis cheap-bought victory, you will say, merited a better exit! The\r\nmost distinguished among the slain were Colonel Whitney and Sir Robert\r\nMonro, who was heard much to blaspheme during the engagement, and as\r\na punishment for which, his tongue was miraculously cut asunder by\r\na sword, that struck him directly across the mouth. His brother, a\r\nphysician, was likewise killed at his side.[423] There were likewise\r\nfound slain, some Presbyterian Parsons,[424] who, fired with holy zeal,\r\nhad quitted their Bibles and took their swords. It was said, that one\r\nof these Parsons, seeing the danger he was in of losing his life as a\r\nSoldier, had recourse to his dignity, supposing that would be a cloak\r\nto save him. ‘Spare my life,’ said he to a Highlander, who was on the\r\npoint of taking it, ‘for I am a Minister of My Master Jesus Christ!’\r\nTo which the other ingeniously replied: ‘If you are a good one, your\r\nMaster has need of you; if not, it’s fitting that you go and take your\r\npunishment elsewhere!’--which dilemma was immediately solved by the\r\nHighlander’s sword. Another Minister, seeing the case his Brother was\r\nin, and being in a fair way to share the same fate, begged his life\r\nof another Highlander for Prince Charles’s sake, by which means he\r\npreserved what he would otherwise inevitably have lost.\r\n\r\nWe now took possession of the enemy’s baggage, camp, and eight pieces\r\nof cannon; which they had not time to carry off--besides a few\r\nprisoners, the chief of whom was Major Lockhart, who, after having his\r\nlife given him, and his liberty upon his parole of honour, afterwards\r\nspurned against gratitude itself, by not only being heinously perjured,\r\nbut more than ordinarily thirsty of those prisoners’ blood who just\r\nbefore had spared his life.[425]\r\n\r\nWe had now about one-hundred prisoners, one of whom seeing his\r\nsituation and ours, said with a grave countenance to his companion: ‘By\r\nmy soul, Dick, if Prince Charles goes on in this way, Prince Frederick\r\nwill never be King George!’ But of the five or six thousand men that\r\nwent with the Prince to the field of battle, scarce three thousand\r\nreturned back with him, for many of them, having loaded themselves with\r\nbooty, returned up to the hills. It was now a great loss to us, that\r\nwe had neither fort or other secure place to keep our prisoners in, so\r\nthat, if it were not merely out of mercy, it was to no purpose to take\r\nprisoners, being without the means of keeping them.\r\n\r\nAnd now being come again to Stirling, the enemy being fled to\r\nEdinburgh, and finding the siege of the Castle went on but slowly\r\nthe spirit of the army began much to change. Factions, grudges, and\r\nprivate interest were now judged proper to be exercised, so that the\r\nPrince was in a mortifying situation, seeing himself deserted by half\r\nhis army, and the others mightily turned. But as it is not for me to\r\nsay more than what relates to myself, I shall only mention the grudge\r\nI have often dearly paid for--that exercised against my Colonel,\r\nwho, on the death of his brother had lately succeeded to the title\r\nof Lord Balmerino. And here it may be proper to give some account of\r\nthe character of this brave man, which though sufficiently known, his\r\npraises cannot enough be sung. He was a man of a noble personage, of\r\napproved loyalty, and had the courage of a lion. He possessed a mind\r\nand genius well ornamented with both natural and acquired parts, being\r\nversed in most languages. He could recite whole pages of Horace, Ovid,\r\nand Virgil at his age of fifty-eight, as perfectly as a school-boy of\r\nsixteen, so that his memory for his years was wonderful, the more so\r\nfor its not being in the least impaired by his hard drinking--his sole\r\nand predominant passion, which if he had a little more restrained, he\r\nwould have shone with the same lustre in the army as he afterwards did\r\non the scaffold. However, whilst with the Prince, he was never failing\r\nwith his duty; and proud he was of having something, wherein he could\r\nshew his loyalty and obedience to his Master.\r\n\r\nBut what was the cause of the quarrel betwixt him and Lord George\r\nMurray, I know not; as Lord Balmerino did not ever directly inform us\r\nwhy he was treated after that manner: only I remember, His Lordship,\r\nwhen he saw himself so apparently ill-used, frequently addressed his\r\ncorps as follows. ‘Come let us do as we are ordered! It is in vain to\r\ndispute; a time will come when I shall see all these things righted,\r\nand that too at Lord George’s cost or mine. But at present he is my\r\nsuperior, and we must obey as we tender the good of the Prince.’ With\r\nsuch soothing expressions has he often accosted us, when some were\r\nmutinying. And certainly he suffered a great deal from Lord George,\r\nfor, to my knowledge, we have been ordered twenty or thirty miles,\r\nharassed and fatigued, and a courier sent after us, ordering us\r\nimmediately to return without halting--saying it was my Lord George\r\nMurray’s orders.[426] And now a harder time than ever came upon us,\r\nfor I can safely say and prove, that from the time of Falkirk Affair\r\nto the Battle of Culloden, notwithstanding the fatigue of the day, I\r\nscarce slept three nights out of seven in bed.\r\n\r\nAnd now having been some time before Stirling Castle, news arrived\r\nfrom Edinburgh, that Cumberland was come thither with an intention to\r\nrally General Hawley’s army and attack us again. As our number had\r\nbeen so much diminished by the desertion of those who after the battle\r\nof Falkirk had gone home loaded with plunder; it was judged expedient\r\nfor us to retire higher into the country, where we were sure of being\r\njoined by some more forces. Accordingly we had orders to proceed on\r\nour march; and on the morning on which we began it, the Prince to St.\r\nRingin,[427] distant about half a mile from Stirling, to give the\r\nnecessary directions for quitting the town and raising the siege;\r\nwhich being done, we retired again, and when at a short distance,\r\nwe were surprized with a hideous noise just behind us; and upon the\r\nPrince’s sending back to inquire what it was, it was found to be a\r\nchurch blown up, just upon the place where a few minutes before we had\r\nbeen standing. This church had been converted into a magazine for our\r\ngun-powder, which by some accident had been set on fire, and several\r\nof the town’s-people and of our soldiers were killed by the explosion.\r\nHowever, continuing our march, we arrived that night at _Crieff_ a\r\nlittle town in the Highlands; and the Prince lodged at Drummond Castle,\r\nthe residence of the illustrious Duke of Perth, which was only a short\r\ndistance from the said town. And now it was judged proper for the army\r\nto separate; accordingly the Prince went the Highland way with the\r\nHighlanders and prisoners for Inverness; and the Horse and Lowland\r\nRegiments the Low-Country Road by the Sea-Coast, which was much\r\nlonger, so that it was three or four weeks before we again formed a\r\njunction.\r\n\r\nAnd now we marched from Crieff to Perth, a large fine town; from Perth\r\nto Cowpar-in-Angus; from Cowpar to Glams; from Glams to Forfar; and\r\nso on to Montrose. The reason why I am so short in mentioning these\r\nplaces, is, I have little to say; we passing them quickly, and nothing\r\nextraordinary happening. But at Montrose we halted a few days. It is a\r\nfine loyal seaport town and looked upon as I was told there, to produce\r\nmen of the greatest wisdom in Scotland. Having staid three days there,\r\nwe were a little surprised at the sight of ships of war, that appeared\r\na little distance off the Coast: and the rumor being that Cumberland\r\nwas pretty nigh us, we began to apprehend lest they should land and\r\nintercept our passage; to prevent which, we marched with all haste out\r\nof the town, the foot going out the third day at night, and the rest\r\nfollowing early the next morning except the Hussars who remained some\r\ndays longer to watch the enemy’s motions.\r\n\r\nSome of my readers may be curious to know what sort of men these\r\nHussars were. A set of braver fellows it would be very hard to find;\r\nmany of them having mounted themselves on horses which they had taken\r\nfrom the enemy. Their Commander[428] also was a wise, courageous\r\nvirtuous man, and behaved himself in his station to the admiration of\r\nall, regulating his corps with such order as to make our enemies and\r\nthe country, even fifty miles distant from us, have more fear of them\r\nthan almost the whole army. In fine, he was of infinite service to\r\nthe Prince, as also were his horse; for their conduct was daring, and\r\ntheir courage was steeled, and few of them there were, who would have\r\nscrupled to go, if possible to hell’s gates to fetch away the keys.\r\n\r\nSoon after our departure from Montrose, we arrived at Aberdeen, where\r\nwe staid two or three days; and notwithstanding our being in the town\r\nthe Presbyterian Ministers ceased not to preach and pray publicly\r\nagainst us. And here it was that I happened to be bedfellow to my\r\nColonel, Lord Balmerino in the same bed where Cumberland afterwards\r\nlay, it being in one of the Chief Provosts’ houses.\r\n\r\nWhen we marched out of Aberdeen, it blew, snowed, hailed, and froze to\r\nsuch a degree, that few Pictures ever represented Winter, with all its\r\nicicles about it, better than many of us did that day; for here men\r\nwere covered with icicles hanging at their eyebrows and beards; and an\r\nentire coldness seizing all their limbs, it may be wondered at how so\r\nmany could bear up against the storm, a severe contrary wind driving\r\nsnow and little cutting hail bitterly down upon our faces, in such a\r\nmanner that it was impossible to see ten yards before us. And very\r\neasy it now was to lose our companions; the road being bad and leading\r\nover large commons, and the paths being immediately filled up with\r\ndrifted snow. However, we continued marching on till about three in the\r\nafternoon, when my horse overcome by the inclemency of the weather,\r\nfairly gave it up and would carry me no farther: and now by a little\r\nhalt I quickly lost my Company, and was obliged to alight and lead\r\nmy horse leg-deep in snow; being upon a wide common, as it appeared\r\nto me, not having seen all that day’s march scarce a house, tree or\r\nbarn. I now expected every moment to perish, as I was quite benumbed\r\nand all covered over with snow, and my horse refused to follow me. At\r\nlast, unable to proceed any farther, I sunk down, quite exhausted, upon\r\nthe snow. In this dreadful situation, I luckily recollected a little\r\nbottle of spirits, which had been given me by the Provost’s Lady; and\r\naccordingly tried to put my frozen hand into my riding-coat pocket\r\nto take it out. On taking a draught of the liquor, I soon found that\r\nnever repose to the wearied traveller, never meat to a most ravenous\r\nhunger, never drink to a most burning thirst, could be more refreshing\r\nor agreeable than this was to me; and I should have finished my bottle,\r\nif a reflection had not come into my head about my poor horse, which\r\nseemed to be in as bad a situation as myself, being one of a delicate\r\nand tender breed. Knowing that he could drink beer, I resolved to make\r\nan experiment whether he would partake of the contents of my bottle. So\r\npouring the remainder of the liquor into the crown of my hat, which I\r\nhad pressed low down for the purpose, and dissolving some snow in it,\r\nin order to mitigate the spirits, I gave it my poor horse to drink:\r\nwhich to my great surprise and pleasure, he did, his mouth, I believe,\r\nbeing so cold that he did not know what he drank. However, now finding\r\nourselves to respire as it were new life and vigor, we endeavoured to\r\nproceed, and after three quarters of an hour, being almost upon the\r\nrelapse again, we stumbled upon a house, and following the walls of it\r\ncame to the door, where entering together with my horse, I surprized\r\nthe poor people who were sitting at the fire. But they, seeing the\r\ncondition I was in, received me with a great deal of good-nature, and\r\npermitted my horse to stand in the house till he was well rubbed, and\r\nthen led him to a little place for him to lie in, giving him hay and\r\ncorn as he wanted. After I had taken off my riding-coat and boots and\r\nwell warmed and refreshed myself, I heard of two more (who had been in\r\nalmost as bad a situation as myself except that their horses continued\r\nto carry them), who were come to the next house adjacent. So going out\r\nto see them, I found them to be two old acquaintances, vizt., one Mr.\r\nMaxwell, and Mr. Ball, an English Gentleman, who, after some chat,\r\nconcluded, that two more harassing marches, than that over the Esk and\r\nthe present, could scarcely be imagined. Accommodating ourselves as\r\nwell as we could for that night, being obliged to lie with our horses,\r\nwe departed early next morning for Old Meldrum, which place most of the\r\narmy had reached before us.\r\n\r\nFrom Old Meldrum we marched the next day for Banff, a little pretty\r\nagreeable town. About this time we heard, that the Highlanders,\r\nwho were with the Prince, had broke down the barracks of _Riven of\r\nBadenoch_ (which were a great eye-sore to them, having been built to\r\nkeep them in order), and having taken the Sergeant and eleven more\r\nprisoners, were in full march for Inverness, distant thence only\r\ntwenty-four miles. And now, after a short stay at Banff, we marched\r\nfor Cullen; and by this time we heard that the Prince had made himself\r\nmaster of the Lord President’s House, and after some little resistance\r\nforced the soldiers in the town of Inverness to retire into the Castle,\r\nwhich, after a regular siege, likewise soon surrendered at discretion.\r\nAbout 200 men were taken prisoners here, and several officers, the\r\nprincipal of whom were the Governor and the Master of Ross. This rapid\r\nsuccess of the Prince gave us great courage. So, marching from Cullen,\r\nthrough Fochabers, over the River Spey, Elgin, Forres and Nairn, towns\r\nonly ten miles distant from each other, we came to be greedy spectators\r\nof our dear Prince again, and what he with his brave Highlanders had\r\neffected. And now, to second our victorious arms, we were joined\r\nby several more of the Clans and Chiefs, and the brave Amazon Lady\r\nMcIntosh,[429] Seaforth and others coming in, or causing their Clans to\r\ncome in, and many who had left us at Falkirk rejoining their colours,\r\ngreatly reinforced the army. When in this flourishing condition, it\r\npleased the Prince to make a visit to the Duke of Gordon’s, whither\r\nall the Guards were ordered to attend him; and in going a curious fine\r\nstandard with this motto ‘_Britons, strike home!_’ that was taken at\r\nFalkirk from Gardiner’s Dragoons, was honourably conferred upon me\r\nby the Prince at the head of the whole Troop; and I had the honor of\r\ncarrying it ever after. Having passed Nairn, Forres, Elgin, and the\r\nriver Spey, just at the other side under Fochabers, we came to the\r\nDuke’s seat.[430] What reception the Prince had, or what passed there\r\nI know not: but after a short stay we attended our Royal Master back\r\nagain to Inverness. But as soon as we arrived there, we had orders\r\nto conduct some of the chief officers, who had lately been taken\r\nprisoners to Forres, and after leaving them there (they being upon\r\ntheir parole of honor) to go to Cullen to inspect all affairs there on\r\nthat side of the country, and to observe the motions of the enemy who\r\nlay at Aberdeen. While at Cullen, where we were continually upon the\r\nwatch by our patrolling parties, we heard that Colonel Grant, a good\r\nFrench Officer, had with his Artillery taken Fort Augustus, and made\r\nthe garrison prisoners; that a part of Fitz-James’ Horse had landed\r\nand joined the Prince;[431] and that Lord George Murray had blocked\r\nup seven hundred men in the Castle of Blair, when he behaved with a\r\ngreat deal of conduct and policy, for, he appeared before the Castle\r\nwith only a few men, having hid most of the Highlanders with him in an\r\nadjacent wood. The garrison being thus deceived made a sally upon him\r\nwith about three hundred men; but he immediately drew his party out\r\nof the wood and surrounded them, upon seeing which, they immediately\r\nsurrendered.[432] So, sending them prisoners to Inverness he persevered\r\nin the siege of the Castle: but the approach of the Hessians soon\r\nobliged him to raise it and leave four hundred men remaining in the\r\nCastle.\r\n\r\nAt this time President Forbes together with Lord Loudon, were\r\nendeavouring to confederate and knit together what forces they could:\r\nbut to prevent their doing much mischief, a party of the brave\r\nMcDonalds, with some few others, were detached under the Command of the\r\nDuke of Perth, who soon dispersed this rising power, and obliged its\r\nheads, viz., Lord Loudon and the President to save themselves in boats.\r\n\r\nSome of my readers may be curious to know who this President was, and\r\nwhat interest he had. He may truly be styled the Oracle of his Country,\r\nfor many resorted to him for advice; and had he been as great a friend\r\nas he was an implacable enemy, James would in all probability have\r\nswayed the English sceptre; for by his interest, cunning and persuasion\r\nhe brought over his own party, together with Sir Alexander McDonald\r\nand several others, who before were just sworn in to the Prince’s\r\ninterest.[433] So, I say, had he been as firm a friend as he was an\r\nimplacable enemy, we should have seen, instead of the four thousand men\r\nwho marched into England, an army of Eighteen or twenty thousand men.\r\n\r\nAbout this time we heard, that the officers who were prisoners upon\r\ntheir parole of honour had broken it, and escaped to the enemy’s\r\narmy, all of them except the Master of Ross and one or two more.[434]\r\nBut what will the world say, to see these officers, whom no tie of\r\nreligion, gratitude or honour could bind, protected and cherished by\r\ntheir own party--nay sent against us, to endeavour to destroy those who\r\nbefore had saved them!\r\n\r\nAnd now we heard, that the Advanced Guard of the enemy was approaching\r\nus, and were got up to Strathbogie. We who were also of the advanced\r\nGuard, upon receiving this intelligence, quitted Cullen, and retreated\r\nto Fochabers, where a considerable body of our men were endeavouring\r\nto make a resistance at the River Spey, and had for that purpose built\r\nbarracks, and made all necessary preparations, in case the passage\r\nof the river had been attempted. But finding their army lay quiet at\r\nAberdeen, and that their advanced party in Strathbogie only made now\r\nand then some little excursions towards us as far as Keith, we, though\r\nat first we were very diligent and alert, we relaxed in our vigilance,\r\nnay fell asleep and at last into a lethargy, in which we unhappily\r\ncontinued till awakened by the foul affair of Culloden, which merits an\r\nepithet bitterer than I can give.\r\n\r\nAbout this time an advanced party under the command of Major Glascow\r\nwent out at night, and hearing that some of the enemy were at\r\nKeith,[435] surrounded that place, and having taken most of them\r\nprisoners, with their arms and equipage, returned the next day with\r\ngreat honour to Spey-side, where Lord John Drummond and Lord Ogilvy\r\ncommanded.\r\n\r\nAs we lay hereabouts a considerable time, assessments were made\r\nupon the country for our support, and among others upon the Earl of\r\nFindlater’s Estate, who on our arrival had taken wing and joined\r\nCumberland Will. The Earl’s Steward, being threatened with military\r\nexecutions, if he refused to comply with our demands (which were always\r\nseconded by such threats, though seldom put in practice) begged leave\r\nto write to his Master for instructions how to act. Upon this the Earl,\r\nhaving consulted with Cumberland, sent a Letter addressed _To the Man\r\nthey call Lord John Drummond_, telling his Lordship, that if he or any\r\nother person should pretend to exercise any military authority over any\r\nthing belonging to him, there were Rebels’ houses enough, on which his\r\nMaster Cumberland promised him he should have his revenge. This Letter\r\nexcited a great deal of indignation among us; and was the cause of what\r\nafterwards happened to his house;--for several of our party, without\r\nany order being given, and indeed without the Prince’s being in the\r\nthen situation of his affairs, able to restrain their fury, ransacked\r\nit, and carried away several articles of value, but without setting\r\nfire to it, or wantonly destroying anything merely for destroying’s\r\nsake.[436]\r\n\r\nAt last news arrived that the enemy had left Aberdeen, and were\r\nmarching against us.[437] This intelligence gave great satisfaction\r\nto many of us, who were in a manner tired out of our lives. Yet\r\nnotwithstanding the approach of the enemy, all the Prince’s endeavours\r\nto collect his whole army, were ineffectual; for many under pretence\r\nof cultivating their lands, or promising to come up soon enough, went,\r\nstaid, and came as they thought proper.\r\n\r\nAnd now finding the enemy advanced pretty fast both by water and land,\r\nthe fleet bringing up their provisions and wearied soldiers; frequent\r\npatrols were sent out by us in order to observe their motions. Here\r\nI had the honour of commanding the last patrolling party that ever\r\ncrossed the Spey for the Prince’s cause. Lord John Drummond (Commander\r\nat the Spey) having ordered me with ten others to patrol all night\r\ntowards the enemy, we began our work about seven o’Clock and continued\r\nit till about five the next morning, being then eight miles from\r\nFochabers and two from the enemy; when we took a man with a Letter\r\nfrom one of Cumberland’s Secretaries to the Duchess of Gordon,[438]\r\ndesiring her to employ all her interest among her vassals in getting\r\ndown provisions and getting together what forces she could, as the\r\nDuke of Cumberland intended to pass the river that day. Having secured\r\nthe Messenger and Letter, we continued our route, till we came up in a\r\nmanner to where they were encamped; for as they lay upon the declivity\r\nof a hill, and had no guards on the top, we were able to approach\r\nvery near to them unperceived. But finding them drawn out in order of\r\nbattle, after seeing all we could see, and some bravadoes and huzzas,\r\nwe retired with all speed, leaving them to wonder what we meant. We\r\nsoon reached Fochabers (on the Spey) where I found Lord John Drummond.\r\nHaving given him the Letter taken from the Duke of Cumberland’s\r\nMessenger and informed him of the situation I had found the enemy in,\r\nI retired to repose myself a little while. When fast asleep, a servant\r\ncame in to tell me that the enemy was in the town, and that it was\r\ntoo late to think of escaping, almost all of our party having already\r\npassed the river. However, starting up in great confusion, I resolved\r\nto risk all rather than fall into their hands, and mounting my horse\r\nescaped by a back road. I had no sooner crossed the river than I was\r\nordered to join a party of about eighty horse who were to remain behind\r\non the banks of the Spey to observe the motions of the enemy; whilst\r\nthe foot, amounting to about two thousand men, marched for Inverness,\r\nwhere the Prince then lay with the greatest part of his army. Finding\r\nthat the enemy after a short halt at the Spey side, began to cross the\r\nriver, we likewise retired and followed our foot, to inform them of\r\nthe enemy’s being in full pursuit of us. This intelligence made our\r\nmen pass through Elgin, without halting, and straight on that night\r\nto Forres, which was ten miles farther; and, after some stay there,\r\nto Nairn, out of which we were next morning driven; the whole English\r\nArmy entering the town at one end, whilst we marched out at the other,\r\nand continuing to pursue us sharply for three or four hours. And here\r\nit was His Grace the Duke of Perth and Colonel O’Sullivan[439] gained\r\nimmortal honour by their bravery and conduct in bringing us off in\r\ngood order from under the very nose of the enemy; for notwithstanding\r\nall their firing upon our rear, and though we were much inferior in\r\nnumbers, we lost not one man.\r\n\r\nSoon after their desisting from pursuing us, we received orders to\r\nhalt, and encamp upon that very place, where the fatal battle of\r\nCulloden was afterwards fought. Having accordingly encamped as well\r\nas we could on the heath that grew upon the common, which served us\r\nboth for bedding and fuel, the cold being very severe, we were soon\r\nafter joined by the Prince and several of his Clans. Finding that\r\nthe enemy did not pursue us we rested ourselves all that night upon\r\nthe Common, and early next morning drew out in battle-array. But\r\nthat day being Cumberland’s birthday,[440] and the enemy shewing no\r\nintention to attack us on it, we reposed ourselves again, though still\r\nkeeping ourselves in readiness, upon the place where we had rested\r\nthe preceding night; a biscuit being given to us for our refreshment.\r\nIn that situation we remained, till the brave Prince came amongst\r\nus in the dusk of the evening, with the full resolution of going to\r\nattack them that night in their camp, distant only seven miles. Orders\r\nwere accordingly given to that effect, which were obeyed with the\r\ngreatest pleasure and alacrity by the whole army. We began our March\r\nabout seven o’Clock leaving great fires burning in our camp: but by\r\nsome strange infatuation or misfortune the road was not rightly taken,\r\neither through the ignorance or treachery of Lord George Murray’s\r\nguide. This still remains doubtful, but this I can say, that with the\r\nlittle knowledge I had of the country I could have conducted them much\r\nbetter and sooner. After we had marched till about three o’Clock in\r\nthe morning, over double the ground that was necessary, we at last\r\ncame pretty nigh the enemy’s camp: and when we were supposing to\r\nsurround them, and for that purpose in some measure drawing out; my\r\nLord George Murray began to be missing; notwithstanding the Prince’s\r\nAides-de-Camp in riding from rank to rank, and asking, for God’s sake!\r\nwhat has become of His Lordship, and telling that the Prince was in\r\nthe utmost perplexity for want of him. In that situation did we remain\r\na considerable time, till, day breaking fast in upon us, we heard\r\nthat Lord George Murray was gone off with most of the Clans. Where\r\nhe had been all that considerable time, or what was his intention in\r\nit, I leave Time to prove. Now, after we had stood some time on the\r\nbrink of entering their camp, the Prince, on receiving the unwelcome\r\nnews of Lord George Murray’s going off with the greatest part of the\r\narmy, was under the necessity of ordering us likewise, much to our\r\ndissatisfaction, to march back again to our Camp. In this manner did\r\nthat noble and well-concerted scheme fall to ruin--and not only to\r\nruin, but in such a manner as to ruin us, who before had hopes of\r\nruining the enemy. But O! for Madness! what can one think, or what can\r\none say here![441]\r\n\r\nThe enemy at our departure, being fully awakened and seeing the\r\njeopardy they had been in, judged rightly, it was their time now to\r\npursue us in the unhappy situation we were then in, being harassed,\r\nhungry and starved and fatigued, almost to the greatest extremity. We\r\nhad no sooner reached our camp again, than news came of the enemy’s\r\nbeing in full march towards us, and of their intention to attack us.\r\nThis disagreeable intelligence vexed us much in our present situation,\r\nthe more so, as of the twelve thousand men, who were actually in arms\r\nand in the pay of the Prince, not above Four thousand were now with him\r\nmany going every moment, notwithstanding his orders to the contrary,\r\nto Inverness, and to woods and houses adjacent, in order to repose and\r\nrest themselves after their late excessive fatigue. Many of these were\r\nso far from rejoining us, that they were taken asleep by the enemy\r\nafter the battle. Those, however, who staid, put the best face on\r\nthe affair they could, and all of us presently appeared surprizingly\r\ncourageous, who only seemed to survive and animated by the spirit\r\nof loyalty and love for our dear Prince. But now why we resolved to\r\nfight, or why we did not retire to Inverness, and keep that town till\r\nwe were fully joined, which might have been easily done, or even at\r\nlast, if judged proper, avoided fighting and make another expedition\r\ninto England in spite of them,--I may say it was Fortune’s will;--for,\r\ncontrary to the Prince’s inclination, Lord George Murray insisted on\r\nstanding and fighting them that day: and as for what he said of our\r\nwanting provisions, it is most certain, though we did that day, we\r\nmight have retired to Inverness and found there a sufficiency of meat\r\nfor two or three days. However, the Prince, notwithstanding his great\r\ninclination to avoid fighting, was at last obliged to give way to the\r\nimportunity of Lord George Murray, who even used terms very cutting\r\nin case of refusal; and was also for fighting His Grace the Duke of\r\nPerth--but this may be said for him, he doubted not but the same Hand\r\nthat had supported and miraculously conducted the Prince hitherto\r\nwould infallibly continue to support him, and make him a glorious\r\nConqueror.[442]\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to give account in what manner we were ranged in\r\nbattle-array. The brave McDonalds, who till then had led the van,\r\nand behaved at all times with great courage and bravery, were now\r\ndisplaced, and made to give way, at the pleasure of Lord George Murray,\r\nto the Athol men, whom he commanded. The rest of the front line was\r\ncomposed of Highlanders: the second, of Lowlanders and French, with\r\nfour pieces of cannon at each wing: and in the rear was the Prince\r\nattended by all the horse, and some foot. In this manner were we drawn\r\nup--four thousand men to fight eleven thousand. The enemy being by\r\nthis time in full view, we began to huzza and bravado them in their\r\nmarch upon us, who were extended from right to left in battle-array, it\r\nbeing upon a common. But, notwithstanding all our repeated shouts, we\r\ncould not induce them to return one: on the contrary, they continued\r\nproceeding, like a deep sullen river; while the Prince’s army might be\r\ncompared to a streamlet running among stones, whose noise sufficiently\r\nshewed its shallowness. The Prince, the Duke of Perth, the Earl of\r\nKilmarnock, Lord Ogilvy, and several other Highland and Lowland Chiefs,\r\nrode from rank to rank, animating and encouraging the soldiers by\r\nwell-adapted harangues.\r\n\r\nThe battle being now begun, the whole fury of the enemy’s Artillery\r\nseemed to be directed against us in the rear; as if they had noticed\r\nwhere the Prince was. By the first cannon shot, his servant, scarcely\r\nthirty yards behind him, was killed; which made some about the Prince\r\ndesire, that he would be pleased to retire a little off: but this he\r\nrefused to do, till seeing the imminent danger from the number of balls\r\nthat fell about him, he was by the earnest entreaties of his friends\r\nforced to retire a little, attended only by Lord Balmerino’s corps.\r\nFrequent looks and turns the Prince made, to see how his men behaved:\r\nbut alas! our hopes were very slender, from the continual fire of\r\nmusketry that was kept up upon them from right to left. We had not\r\nproceeded far, when I was ordered back, lest the sight of my standard\r\ngoing off, might induce others to follow. In returning, various\r\nthoughts passed my soul, and filled by turns my breast with grief for\r\nquitting my dear Prince, now hopes of victory, then fear of losing--the\r\nmiserable situation the poor loyalists would again be reduced to--and\r\nwhat we had to expect if we left the field alive: these thoughts, I\r\nsay, strangely wrought upon me, till, coming to the place I was on\r\nbefore, and seeing it covered with the dead bodies of many of the\r\nHussars who at the time of our leaving had occupied it, I pressed on,\r\nresolving to kill or be killed. Some few accompanied my standard, but\r\nsoon left it. At this time, many of ours from right to left were giving\r\nway and soon the battle appeared to be irretrievably lost. The enemy,\r\nafter we had almost passed the two ranks, flanking and galling us with\r\ntheir continual fire, forced us at last back, broke our first line, and\r\nattacked the second, where the French troops were stationed. I happened\r\nthen to be there, and after receiving a slight grazing ball on my left\r\narm, met with Lord John Drummond, who, seeing me, desired I would come\r\noff with him, telling me all was over and shewing me his regiment, just\r\nby him, surrounded. Being quickly joined by about forty more horse, we\r\nleft the field of battle in a body, though pursued and fired upon for\r\nsome time. When we arrived at the foot of the hills, some of us took\r\none way, and some another: I, however, with about six more, continued\r\nwith Lord John Drummond; and it was with some difficulty we passed the\r\nrapid torrents and frozen roads, till one o’Clock that night, when we\r\ncame to a little village at the foot of a great mountain, which we had\r\njust crossed. Here we alighted, and some went to one house and some to\r\nanother. None of these cottages having the conveniences to take in our\r\nhorses, who wanted refreshment as well as we, many of them perished at\r\nthe doors. I happened to be in one of the most miserable huts I had\r\never met with during my whole life; the people were starving to death\r\nwith hunger. However, having laid myself down on the floor to rest\r\nmyself after having been almost thirty hours on horse-back; the people\r\ncame crying about me and speaking a language I did not understand,\r\nwhich made my case still more unpleasant. But by good luck, a soldier\r\nsoon after came in, who could speak both to them and me, and brought\r\nwith him some meal, which was very acceptable, as I was almost starving\r\nwith hunger. Of this meal we made at that time a very agreeable dish,\r\nby mixing it very thick with cold water, for we could get no warm:\r\nand so betwixt eating and drinking we refreshed ourselves, till four\r\no’Clock in the morning; when Lord John Drummond and the rest of us\r\nbegan our march, we knew not whither, through places it would be in\r\nvain to describe; for we saw neither house, barn, tree, or beast nor\r\nany beaten road, being commonly mid-leg deep in snow, till five o’Clock\r\nthat afternoon; when we found ourselves near a village called _Privana\r\na Badanich_,[443] the barracks of which, as I mentioned before, the\r\nPrince had destroyed. Being now, to our surprize, almost upon it, we\r\nconsulted amongst ourselves how we might best get intelligence from\r\nit; for, as it lay on the road from Inverness twenty-four miles we\r\napprehended the enemy might be there. But fortunately a soldier coming\r\nout told us, that the village was occupied by the Prince’s men. This\r\nintelligence gave us great pleasure; and having accordingly entered\r\nthe place, we found a great many of the Prince’s adherents, the chief\r\nof whom was Lord George Murray and the Duke of Perth; but we heard no\r\nnews where the poor Prince was. At first we had great hopes of rallying\r\nagain: but they soon vanished, orders coming for every one to make the\r\nbest of his way he could. So some went one way, some another: those\r\nwho had French Commissions surrendered; and their example was followed\r\nby my Colonel, Lord Balmerino, tho’ he had none. Many went for the\r\nmountains, all being uncertain what to do or whither to go.\r\n\r\nIn this perplexity I resolved to steer my course through the\r\nmountainous country, notwithstanding the advice of many to the\r\ncontrary, who told me, it would be impossible for me to escape, and\r\nbegged I would go and surrender, assuring me, that if I attempted the\r\nmountains, I should inevitably perish in them. But reflecting, how\r\nnigh suffering my Father had been in the year 1715, taking Courage and\r\nPatience for my guides, I resolved to enterprize a journey through\r\na Country that few of my Nation had ever passed before. So, folding\r\nup my Standard, whose Motto was _Britons! strike home!_ I put it in\r\nmy Riding-coat pocket, in hopes it might be of use another day, and\r\nbegan my journey, in company with three others, for the Highlands.\r\nHaving discharged our horses, after a long day’s journey, we came to a\r\nhouse situated on Garvie-more, twelve miles from any other, where we\r\nmet with many of our party, who had arrived there before us. However,\r\nputting up in the best manner with what little we could obtain, we set\r\nforward for Fort Augustus: but on the road, a misfortune happened,\r\nthat disconcerted all our plans; for a man who carried our provisions\r\nof Oatmeal, fallen a little behind, by accident met with some of the\r\nBrigade Picquets, who robbed him of our meal and two riding-coats. This\r\nunexpected loss obliged us to separate soon afterwards, being too many\r\nto subsist in this wild tract of country, if we had kept together.\r\nHowever, having got betwixt Fort Augustus and Fort William, we struck\r\nup into the country to the right, and passed several large mountains in\r\nLochiel’s Country, where we staid three days, because we heard, that\r\nthe brave Prince was nigh us, and to take leave of one another, the\r\nnecessaries of life being exceedingly scarce, from the great number of\r\npeople wandering over the hills as well as we. I here went to wait upon\r\nthe Duke of Perth, who was at the house of Doctor Cameron, Lochiel’s\r\nBrother: but being told by two sentinels at the door, that His Grace\r\nwas indisposed, I returned without seeing him. It was now reported,\r\nthat an English spy had been at Doctor Cameron’s house which obliged\r\nme in all haste to quit that place; for certain it is, had I staid\r\nthere any longer, and the Highlanders supposed me to be the spy, they\r\nwould have made away with me. I therefore left my companions and set\r\nforward to Lochaber, the wildest country I ever was in. And now it\r\nwas that I began to be truly miserable, and to endure hardships which\r\nI had thought it impossible for human nature to support, for in that\r\nmost hideous place I was deprived of every thing that could give me\r\ncomfort: true it is, I found some few inhabitants; but in language food\r\nand customs quite different from what I had ever seen before. In this\r\nplace I was forced to stay several days, on account of the prodigious\r\nquantity of snow that fell upon the mountains, and hindered me from\r\ndiscerning or making any road. During my stay, I by good fortune got\r\na pound of black bread to live upon. The snow somewhat melting I set\r\nforward again from Lochaber towards the sea-shore. On the road I\r\nwas overtaken by about forty women, half-starved to death who were\r\nwandering up and down for safety. Some of them, who spoke English,\r\ntold me, they had been driven out of their houses by the soldiers who\r\nwere sent out from Fort William to ravage burn and plunder all before\r\nthem and now it was that the most heart-rending scenes of misery began\r\nto present themselves; for many of these poor creatures with children\r\nin their arms, lay extended in the clefts of the rocks half covered\r\nwith snow, dead, and a-dying in the most piteous manner. With these\r\ncompanions of misery, and daily meeting with more I passed some days.\r\nI now learned, that many of the unfortunate adherents of the Prince\r\nhad been famished to death on the hills and I expected it would soon\r\nbe my turn, for I began to be almost unable to proceed, my shoes being\r\nworn out, and the sharp rocks wounding my feet. However, I encouraged\r\nmyself with the thought that my pursuers would have the same difficulty\r\nto climb the rocks as I had; and on the twentieth day[444] after our\r\ndefeat at Culloden I came to the sea, in Clan-Ronald’s Country; the\r\nview of which was most agreeable to me, though even then I saw no\r\nprospect of escaping. Getting a little refreshment from the people who\r\ndwelt on the sea-shore, I began as it were to revive again, having been\r\nalmost starved to death with hunger and cold; for I had been obliged\r\nto lie down for whole nights under the shelves of rocks, and was for\r\ntwo or three days together without eating at all, as nothing could\r\nbe obtained either for love or money. Though I was fat and strong at\r\nthe battle of Culloden, I was now quite emaciated and reduced to so\r\nmiserable a state, that, if I had had another day to walk, I am sure\r\nI must have died; for I was not only starved with hunger and cold,\r\nbut frightfully covered with vermin, which bit me all over my body so\r\nthat there remained not one whole place in my skin. This, joined with\r\nthe pain in my torn feet, made me often think that Job could not be\r\nin a more piteous condition. Yet as he had God for his comforter, so\r\nhad I; for the justness of the cause I was suffering for, gave me\r\ngreat courage, and supported me much: and though I saw daily enmities\r\nexercised against me, it was a great satisfaction to me, to think,\r\nthat, during the time I had the honour of being a soldier under the\r\nbanner of our dear Prince, I could not accuse myself of one act that a\r\nChristian might blush at.\r\n\r\nBeing somewhat recovered by the particular care of a worthy Gentleman\r\n(whose kindness I had the satisfaction in a little time to return by an\r\nagreeable meeting with him at Paris), I began to inquire, if it were\r\npossible from island to island to make my escape out of the country;\r\nfor could I have sold myself at that time as a slave into Turkey, I\r\nwould have done it. My host told me, that it was impossible, as all the\r\nboats had been destroyed by Cumberland’s order. However, one morning,\r\nbeing in that perplexity of thought how to get off, and fearing every\r\nmoment the landing of soldiers to destroy the country--news was brought\r\nus that two French ships had come into the Lough just by--which\r\nmightily raised our hopes, that either a restoration of the Prince’s\r\naffairs were at hand, or that we should escape to France. So, running\r\ndown to see and hear what we could we found them to be ships destined\r\nfor the Prince’s service, having on board a great quantity of arms and\r\nammunition, with five barrels of gold, pretty large and nearly one-yard\r\nlong--which before our late fatal disasters might have been of great\r\nuse.[445]\r\n\r\nNotice being sent all about the Mountains, as far as time would permit;\r\nseveral, who lay despairing, came down to the sea-shore, and among\r\nthe rest, my old patron the Duke of Perth, Lord John his brother; Sir\r\nThomas Sheridan, Secretary Murray, Mr. John Hay, and Doctor Cameron.\r\nThese being assembled together, judged it proper though no one knew\r\nwhere the Prince was (many thinking he was gone off for France) to have\r\nthe money and arms brought on shore; which was done on the evening\r\nafter. Going securely to sleep that night expecting to sail for France\r\nthe next day, we were surprised by the noise of cannon, which awakened\r\nus about three o’Clock in the morning; and getting up to see what the\r\nmatter was, we had for our comfort the disagreeable news and sight of\r\nthree English ships, that were come from Fort William to attack the\r\nFrench, whose appearance on the coast they had noticed, it seems. This\r\nsight displeased us very much: however, fighting was the resolution of\r\nus all. The two French Frigates (viz., the _Mars_ and the _Bellona_),\r\nbeing pretty strong, and having a sufficient quantity of men, cannon,\r\nand ball, resolved to make head against the three English vessels, of\r\nwhich one was the _Baltimore_,[446] that name being written upon her\r\nrudder, which was carried off by a cannon-ball. The place they fought\r\nin, was a creek of rocks, which held the French (the English coming\r\ndown upon them) as it were penn’d up, having the land on their back and\r\nboth sides. However it was easy for them to hold communications with\r\nus on shore, who were four hundred armed men or more; so that had they\r\nbeen obliged to abandon their Ships, they might have saved themselves\r\non shore. The Crews of the two ships amounting to nearly eleven hundred\r\nmen, might, with the assistance of the Highlanders, have made an\r\neffectual resistance to the English, if they had attempted to invade\r\nus. The battle furiously beginning at three o’Clock in the morning, it\r\nremained doubtful till four in the afternoon, who would be victors. Nor\r\nwas it a small pleasure to us to see those combatants engaged, and the\r\nskill of the French, whose fire seldom missed the English; for many\r\nof us being upon the rock as it were hung over these ships, in such a\r\nmanner that they could not hurt us with either cannon or musketry; we\r\ncould discern how matters went, and few balls were fired but we might\r\nsee whether they hit or missed, which latter the English frequently\r\ndid. During the engagement, the Highlanders were busied in carrying the\r\narms, money, and powder off from the sea-shore; which service they\r\nperformed with amazing resolution, many a cannon ball being fired,\r\nin order to hinder them, by the largest of the English ships. Few\r\nHighlanders there were but what had a cask of brandy hid privately in\r\nthe hills, with which some of them got merry before night. At last we\r\nhad the satisfaction to see the English hoist their sails, leave the\r\nFrench, and sail to the main ocean. The French repaired their ships as\r\nfast as possible, and endeavoured to make what haste out they could,\r\nlest the English should return with a greater force.\r\n\r\nAll being over and hopes reviving again; one who had been in the Guards\r\nwith me, came and told me, he had found a barrel of money, and that he\r\nwould get me as much of it as I pleased. To this proposal I replied,\r\nThat I had no manner of use for it, for, if I should be so fortunate\r\nas to escape into France, I had friends enough there, who would take\r\ncare of me; and that if I died or were taken, it would be of no service\r\nto me. Moreover if the Prince should rally again, how shocking it\r\nwould be to have to reproach ourselves with being a hindrance to our\r\ndear Prince’s designs. On hearing this reply, he, being of a temper\r\nexceedingly rude, began to repent of informing me of it; and seemed\r\nresolved to take some, and let the rest be embezzled away; for as\r\nfar as I could learn he had hidden it in a place unknown to any one\r\nbut whether in the confusion when everything was carried off, he had\r\nstopped it, or carried it away, elsewhere, I know not, for he would not\r\ntell me. But strange, you will say, must have been the confusion when\r\na barrel of gold fell into his hands, and no one the wiser. However,\r\nI determined to quitt my hands and conscience of it; and much search\r\nbeing made for it at this time, I went and told one Mr. Harrison, a\r\nPriest,[447] about it, and what such a man intended to do, and beg\r\nthat he would keep an eye on him: but he, being a little before me,\r\noverheard me, and turning back knocked me down with a stick, and\r\nswore, that he would kill me the first opportunity. But the Priest,\r\ntaking my part endeavoured to pacify him, desiring him to desist from\r\nthoughts of the money, and shew him where it was. The man, however,\r\nremained obstinate, and said he was resolved to have some of it, since\r\nthe Prince’s affairs seemed now desperate; alleging that his Father\r\nand himself had been ruined for loyalty. They then both agreed to go\r\ntogether; but what afterward passed, I know not.\r\n\r\nRecovering myself from the fall he gave, I went towards the ships,\r\nin order to get on board that night, and in going I was so happy as\r\nto meet with the Duke of Perth, who, seeing me in a most piteous\r\ncondition, called me to him, and, after embracing me, and giving me\r\nmost agreeable consolations, said: ‘Dear Mr. Daniel, I am truly sorry\r\nfor you; but I assure you that you shall go along with me, and if we\r\nare so fortunate as to get to France, depend upon it, that I shall\r\nalways be your friend.’ In reply I begged His Grace not to be in pain\r\nabout me; for the loss of me was only the loss of my life, not having\r\none dependant upon me; and assured him that I was truly resigned to\r\nGod’s holy will; and thanking His Grace for his kindness and concern\r\nfor me, wished we might be so happy as to reach France. And now, after\r\nwe had staid some time upon the sea-shore, waiting for the boats, three\r\nwere sent to fetch us; but we were obliged to wade breast-deep into the\r\nsea, before we could get on board of them. While we were lying on the\r\nshore--the Duke, poor man! wrapped up in a blanket!--a Highlander by\r\naccident let the snuff of his tobacco-pipe fall into a barrel of gun\r\npowder; which blowing up, with a great number of stones about it, one\r\nof them flew so near my ear, that I could not hear at all for three\r\nhours after. This explosion alarmed us at first, as we supposed the\r\nEnglish had returned to attack the French ships again: but happily no\r\nother mischief was done, except that the Highlander lost his life.\r\n\r\nThe boat the Duke was in, put off immediately; and another coming\r\ntook me in, with many more, and carried us to the _Bellona_, where\r\nwe remained at anchor till two o’Clock the next morning, when we\r\nsailed for France.[448] The chief of those in our ship were Sir Thomas\r\nSheridan;[449] Mr. Sheridan, his nephew;[450] and Mr. Hay.[451] We\r\nwere twenty-five days in sailing to France, and met with no opposition\r\nduring our voyage. I was exceedingly seasick, and having no pockets,\r\nand every one thinking I should die, I gave a purse of money to Mr.\r\nJohn Hay’s servant, telling him, if I died, to keep it; and if I\r\nsurvived to carry it for me to France; which he carefully did for\r\nme. In the ship I was in, there raged a contagious distemper, which\r\ncarried off sixty-seven in twenty-five days: and about the tenth\r\nday of our voyage, I saw the body of my friend and patron the Duke\r\nof Perth, thrown over-board; which afflicting sight, joined with my\r\nviolent sickness, I expected would have put an end to my life. But what\r\nI thought would have killed me, perhaps contributed to save my life\r\nin that pestiferous ship; as my continual vomiting may have hindered\r\nany thing noxious from taking any effect upon me. But what is very\r\nsurprising, for twenty-two days I had not one call of nature, which\r\nI affirm upon honour. And now after all my adventures dangers and\r\nfatigues, I at the end of twenty-five landed in France, where, to my\r\nsatisfaction, I have lived since, in the expectation daily of seeing\r\nwhat I have ever wished to see.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Postscript_\r\n\r\nHaving now finished my Narrative, I hope the truth of what I have\r\nwritten will make up for the faults that may be found in it, and that\r\nthe candid Reader will find matter of admiration and esteem in the\r\nbehaviour and actions of one so dear, whom I had once the honour to\r\nserve. I shall conclude with\r\n\r\n    _Fuimus Troies, et erimus iterum._\r\n\r\n    Trojans we have been, and will again\r\n\r\nto the satisfaction of all good men!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEIL MACEACHAIN’S NARRATIVE OF THE WANDERINGS OF PRINCE CHARLES IN THE\r\nHEBRIDES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe misfortunate battle of Colloden being fought upon the 16th of\r\nApril, 1746, his royal highness seeing that the day was irrecoverably\r\nlost, concluded that his only business was to endeavour the saving of\r\nhimself out of the hands of his enemies: whereupon, having retired to\r\na neighbouring eminence, hard by the place of action, accompanied by\r\na few of Fitz-James’s horse, there, having made a little stop, not\r\nknowing whither to direct his course when luckily one Edmond Burk,\r\nthe servant of one Alexander MacLeod,[452] son of Mr. John MacLeod,\r\nof Muiravine Side, rod accidentally by them, thinking to find his\r\nmaster among them, whom he had not seen since the beginning of the\r\nbattles. His master (who happened to be there present with the prince),\r\nknowing him to be very well acquaint with all the different rods of\r\nthe highlands, ordered him to lead them the safest and surest road to\r\nGlengarry. Whereupon the prince, accompanied by Master O’Sulivan,[453]\r\nMr. Allan MacDowell,[454] priest, and the said Alexander MacLeod,\r\nmarched westward, and arrived that night about eight o’clock to\r\nThomas Gortlickshorge,[455] a gentleman of the name of Fraser, in\r\nStratharagaig,[456] where he met, as it was said, with my Lord Lovat,\r\nand supt with him there that night.\r\n\r\nAfter supper the prince reckoning it dangerous to stay so very near the\r\nenemy, the first night, we resolved to continue his journey towards\r\nGlengarry; about break of day, finding himself quite fatigued and\r\nworn out for want of rest, he consulted with his fellow-travellers,\r\nwhither he might repair with most safety to take some hours repose.\r\nThey all concluded that the Castel of Invergary was the surest and\r\nsafest place for that purpose, and a great conveniency of concealment,\r\nand (that he) might repose himself without any fear (there) till such\r\ntime as he and his party should take further resolutions. Being then\r\nprevailed upon by these reasons, he immediately repaired thither, where\r\nhe was received by Glengarry with the greatest pleasure.[457] When he\r\nsufficiently refreshed himself he took a resolution to proceed still\r\nfurther, fearing to stay long in one place. He departed that same day\r\nfrom Glengarry, being the 17th in the evening, and continued his route\r\ntowards Lochaber, and came that night to Donald Cameron, of Glenpean’s\r\nhouse, where he passed the remaining part of the night.\r\n\r\nNext day being the 18th, he set out for the Braes of Moror, and arrived\r\nin the evening at Angus Mack Eachan’s[458] house, son to Alexander\r\nMcEachan, of Domondrack. He was so much fatigued that night, that he\r\ncould neither eat nor drink, and required the help of a man to support\r\nhim to his bed. The next day, being the 19th, he ventured to pass the\r\nwhole day in a wood near the house, in order to recruit more strength\r\nfor a night walk; and accordingly when it was late, he set out for\r\nArasack, where he arrived about six in the morning, and went straight\r\nto Angus MacDonald’s house in Borrodale, where he quartered, after his\r\nlanding, till he marched out of the country.[459] At his arrival here,\r\nhe found a great many Mack Donalds assembled together, who had lately\r\nescaped out of the battle of Colloden--gentlemen of both Glengarry’s\r\nand Clanranald’s families. During the eight days he stayed in that\r\ncountry, he had daily conferences with young Clanranald, Colonel\r\nMacDonald of Barisdale, and several others of both families, treating\r\nwhich was the safest place, and surest method for his concealment.\r\nAfter they had satisfied him as to that, they protested, and assured\r\nhim he should have nothing to fear, that they would stand by him if\r\nhe only would stay among them to the last man. With this he seemed\r\nto be very much satisfied, till Mr. O’Neil[460] and O’Sulivan,[461]\r\nby the advice of Mr. Allan MacDonald, and one Donald MacLeod, of\r\nGaltrigil,[462] perswaded him in a private council, to quite that\r\ncountry for good, and all; and as there was no appearance of succeeding\r\nfurther, and that they lost all hopes of gaining the point they once\r\nundertook, it was better to run for the Lewis, where Donald promised\r\nto procure a ship for them as far as the Orkneys, and there, he\r\nassured them to find a ship to transport them to France. The prince\r\nbeing prevailed upon by these convincing reasons, ordered a ten-oar\r\nboat belonging to Angus MacDonald of Borodale, to be seized upon, and\r\nwithout any further consultation, he put to sea about six o’clock at\r\nnight, accompanied only by these persons who were the authors of the\r\nnew scheme, without acquainting any body of any such design,[463] till\r\nthey were seen fairly under sail of the coast.\r\n\r\nThis night’s voyage was like to cost them dire; for they were not long\r\nat sea when there came on such a terrible roaring of thunder, preceed’d\r\nby such dreadfull flashes of lightning, accompanied with a prodigious\r\npoure of rain, so that the whole elements seemed to rebel against them,\r\nand threatened to send them every moment to eternity; the wind, which\r\ncontinued to blow fair the whole night, coming about to the north,\r\nquite contrary to their course, about twelve o’clock at night, made\r\nthem despair of continuing their intended voyage any further, and so\r\n[they] prepared for death, as being sure to be shattered upon the rocks\r\nof the nearest shore. Amidst all these dangers he appeared intrepide,\r\nand offered his service to Donald MacDonald and Donald MacLeod, seeing\r\nthey were the only two that was of any service in the boat, whilst all\r\nthe rest was oblidged to give it up, stiffened and benumbed with cold.\r\nThey continued in that agony the whole night, ’till about break of day,\r\nwhen Rory MacDonald, who stood at the helm all the time, discerning\r\nBenbicula in south-west, where he knew to be one of the best harbours\r\non that coast, and the wind blowing astern of them, he piloted them\r\ninto the harbour of Roshiness, within five long miles of Clanranald’s\r\nhouse, which being Sunday, and the 29th of Aprile.[464]\r\n\r\nThey were no sooner landed but they were seen by a herd of\r\nClanranald’s who stayed in the place always to take care of his\r\nmaster’s cattle, and seeing a number of men finely clad, and fully\r\narmed, supposing them to be an enemy, he immediately made off, with\r\na nimble pair of heels, and carried the news of what he had seen to\r\nhis master, as he was at dinner with Mr. John MacAuley,[465] Neil\r\nMacDonald,[466] and several other gentlemen. Clanranald, moved by this\r\nunexpected surprise, before he resolved upon any thing, sent Donald\r\nMacDonald to know the certainty of what the herd had told him. Master\r\nMacAulay, who was parish minister in the country, to satisfie his own\r\ncuriosity sent one of his auditors to learn what they were, from whence\r\nthey came, and where they were bound for. This fellow, pretending to\r\nhave been sent thither by Clanranald, upon a report of a boat’s being\r\nland’d there, and to examine what they were, learned it was the prince\r\nwho designed to make for the Lewis in order to make his escape, who\r\ncame back and told the minister the same. The minister judging that he\r\ncould not meet with a better opportunity to show his zeal and affection\r\nfor the government, despatched a courier that same day away to the\r\nHerris, with a letter to his father, who was minister there,[467]\r\ncharging him to write immediately upon receipt of his letter, to Mr.\r\nColin MacKenzie, established minister at Stornoway,[468] informing him\r\nof the same, and ordering him to settle all measures with Seaforth’s\r\nfactor there to apprehend the prince at his first landing.\r\n\r\nDonald MacDonald, who was sent by Clanranald to learn the strength of\r\nthe enemy, as it was believed, having returned, acquainted him of the\r\nmatter of fact, assuring, he spoke to Mr. Allen MacDonald, who ordered\r\nhim to tell Clanranald to come and see him, as he designed to go off\r\nthat night. Whereupon Clan and Neil MacDonald went privately out of the\r\ntown, and took their way straight to Roshiness, where they found the\r\nprince, in the house with Mr. O’Sulvan, O’Neil, Mr. Allen MacDonald,\r\nand Donald MacLeod. The prince received him very kindly, after having\r\ncommunicated to him his design he took leave of him, and put to sea\r\nagain that night, with the same persons that accompanied him thither.\r\nThe heavens proved more favourable to them that night than the former,\r\nhaving met with no danger or opposition, and at daybreak they came in\r\nto Loch Maddy, in north-west, where they skulk’d the whole day, being\r\nthe 30th, seeing they durst not venter to sea in the daytime, for fear\r\nto be discovered by the several men of war that guarded the coast at\r\nthat time. They set out from Loch Maddy about six o’clock, which was\r\nthe ordinary hour they always departed, and landed in Scalpa, in the\r\nHerris, early next morning, being the 1st of May.[469]\r\n\r\nBefore they came near a house they took borrow’d names and employments.\r\nMaster O’Sulvan took that of Captain Sinclair, the prince called\r\nhimself William Sinclair, the captain’s son, O’Neill changed his\r\nname into Neilson, and mate Master Allen named himself Dalrumple,\r\nand Rosman, and Donald MacLeod, master of the boat y^t brought them\r\nthither, and swore the crew to attest the same.\r\n\r\nAfter this ceremony was over, they came to Donald Campbell’s house,\r\nwho was the most sponsable gentleman in that part of the country, but\r\nan enemy by his name, and a downright hypocrite in his heart;[470] and\r\nbeing asked by their landlord what they were, they told him they were\r\nsea-fareing men from the Orkneys, who being homeward bound from Irland,\r\nlost their ship near the Mull of Kintyre, and most of their crew, and\r\nwere thereupon forced to freight their present boat and crew from Mull,\r\nas fare as the Lewis, where they hop’t to find a vessel to transport\r\nthem safe home to their own country. The next day, being the 2nd of\r\nMay, they sent Donald MacLeod away to Stornaway before them to have\r\na ship ready freighted, and to get intelligence how the people stood\r\naffected, and to send them word accordingly; which project would have\r\nhad the intended success, were it not for the imprudence of Donald, and\r\nMacAulay’s malicious letter.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was arrived at Stornaway he set about putting his\r\ncommission in execution, and discharged himself so well of that duty,\r\nthat he got a ship freighted that same evening, and wrote back to the\r\nprince, who remained still at Scalpa, to repair thither as soon as\r\npossible, but unwarily having gone to drink a bottle with the captain\r\nof the ship, reposing too much trust in him, he disclosed to him all\r\nthe secret, whereupon the captain told him, if he should load the\r\nship with gold he would not employ her for that purpose: Having said\r\nthis, he went and published in all the streets of the town that the\r\npretender (as he called him) was to come to town privately next night,\r\nand if Mr. MacLeod had not escaped out of the town he had certainly\r\nbeen apprehend’d that night. The prince, who knew nothing of what was\r\npassing before him, he set out upon the 3 of May for Stornaway afoot,\r\nleaving orders with his crew to return home to the mainland and restore\r\nthe boat to the owner. That day he suffered a vast deal of cold and\r\nfatigue, the day being so extreme bad; Donald MacLeod mett him about a\r\nquarter of an mile without the town, and told him it was dangerous for\r\nhim to venter into it by reason they all got notice of his approach,\r\nand were in an uproar all under arms, and that all this was the effect\r\nof Mr. MacAulay’s letter.\r\n\r\nThe prince, raging with anger and fear, retired that night to my Lady\r\nKildin’s house,[471] which lay about half a mile off without the town,\r\nand there he passed the remaining part of the night, notwithstanding\r\nthat a great manny of the mob made a dreadful noise about the house a\r\ngreat part of the night. Having held a consultation with the lady what\r\nwas properest to be done, she told him that his only safety consisted\r\nin returning to Benbicula again, under Clanranald’s protection, since\r\nhis project in coming thither misgave. In order thereunto, she procured\r\nthem a boat to cross Loch Stornaway, which was a nearer cut to return\r\nto Scalpa; where he left his boat and crew, having taken leave of the\r\nworthy lady, he set out about four o’clock in the morning, crossed the\r\nLoch, and arrived back at Donald Campbell’s house, that night, which\r\nwas the 4th of May.[472] He was no sooner arrived but he found all the\r\ncrew was gone except two, upon account the country people threatened to\r\napprehend them.\r\n\r\nThe prince fearing to make a stay in any man’s house, who found out\r\nwhat he really was, and reckoning it impracticable to find as many\r\nmen as would manage his own boat so soon as he would require [them],\r\nespecially in the heart of an enemy’s country, he bought a small boat\r\nfrom Donald Campbell, whom it was said he bribed by giving him a sum\r\nof mony for to hold his tongue, and disown that he knew what he was.\r\nIt seemed very difficult for them now to get safe into Benbicula, by\r\nreason the chanel was pestered with the English navy, sent there a\r\npurpose to hinder the prince or any of his party to make their escape.\r\nHe set out upon the 5th from Scalpa, and rowed along the coast the\r\nwhole night; as they passed the mouth of the Finnasvay bay, they\r\nobserved a ship in the harbour which they belived to be the _Baltimore_\r\nsloop of war, Thomas How Captain, a brother to my Lord How in Irland,\r\nand being seen from aboard the _Baltimore_ she immediately sent off\r\none of her long boats in pursuit of them, and chased them the whole\r\nnight; about 5 aclock in the morning she came up pretty close to them,\r\nthe prince terrefied at the approach of the enemy begg’d of the rowers\r\nto pull away strongly for fear to fall a sacrifice in the hands of\r\nthese ravenous wolves, whereupon they ran in upon a ridge of rocks they\r\nobserved betwixt them and the land, and there sculked close by one of\r\nthe rocks to observe what course the _Baltimore_ was to take next,\r\nwhile all of a sudden they saw her change her course, not able to find\r\nthem out. Despairing of success she returned to her harbour.\r\n\r\nThe prince and his party, taking fresh courage, being free from danger\r\nthat day, they determined as it was near day to draw nearer the\r\nland, and sculk there, ’till it was late, that the men might refresh\r\nthemselves, for the fatigue of the ensueing night; they approached to\r\nthe shore, and found it to be a desert island, about two leagues from\r\nthe continent of the Herris, where they found no living creature. They\r\nwere turned of provisions so short that a lippie of gradan oatmeal[473]\r\nwas all that remained to them to satiate their hungry appetites, which\r\nsome of the men took, put some water about it with a little salt, and\r\nfell a eating of it. The prince seeing them eat it as hearty as if it\r\nhad been better cheer, ask’d them whither it tasted better than it\r\nlook’t, they answered if he would only try it, he would be as well\r\npleased with it as what they were, whereupon, calling for a little of\r\nit, he eat it as contentedly as the most delicate dish that ever was\r\nserved upon his table, saying at the same time that it tasted pretty\r\nwell, considering the ugly appearance it made. It was not long after,\r\nwhen Providence cast more plenty in their way, for one of the crew,\r\nwho was more curious than the rest, having gone to take a view of the\r\nisland, found in the farther end of it abundance of cod and ling, half\r\na barrel of salt and a pot. Although they were starving the whole day\r\nfor hunger, yet they durst not make a fire, by reason they thought it\r\ndangerous to raise a smock upon the island, lest being seen from the\r\ncontinent it might discover them. When it grew dark the prince ordered\r\nthe crew to carry some of the fish to the boat, when not a man, either\r\nsimple or gentle obeyed him,[474] he himself went in a passion, and\r\ncarried half a dozen of them in his arms, and threw them in the boat,\r\nsaying since they were all so gentle and scroupelous, that he would\r\ntake the sin upon himself, and show them the exemple; the whole crew\r\ndash’d and confused, would have load’d the boat if he permitted them.\r\nNow being about six o’clock, they put to sea, and landed in Benbicula\r\nthe next day, a little after sunrise, in the very same harbour which\r\nthey left some days before the 6th of May.\r\n\r\nHe set his foot no sooner ashore[475] but he sent an express for\r\nClanranald, who came next night, having taken none with him but Neil\r\nMacDonald, who was there with him before. Upon Clanranald’s arrival, he\r\nseemed quite easie and told him that Providence had sent him under his\r\nprotection, where he hoped to be sheltered, and that he was to throw\r\nhimself in his hands to dispose of him as he thought fit. Clanranald\r\nassured him he had nothing to fear, and that he would find a place for\r\nhis concealment, where none should have the least opportunity to see\r\nhim, but such as he should employ to carry to him whatever he wanted.\r\n\r\nAfter he had sufficiently refreshed himself for some days, it was\r\nthought dangerous to make any longer stay at Roshiness, because being\r\na place much frequented by boats from the neighbouring countrys, they\r\nwould be soon discovered; for this reason, he was conducted from\r\nthence to Bareness, about three miles from Roshiness, where he had\r\nthe conveniency of a little hutt of a house that was in the place,\r\nthe entry of which was so very narrow, that he was forced to fall\r\nupon his knees, and creep in upon his belly, as often as he entered.\r\nThis habitation not pleasing him, he begged of Clanranald to send him\r\ninto some Christian place wherein he could have more room, and use\r\nmore freedom and ease, for in that monstrous hole he could never have\r\nsatisfaction, which he said the devil had left because he had not room\r\nenough in it.\r\n\r\nThe next day being the 10th of May, it was determined to send him to\r\nCorrodall, a little pleasant glen in South-West,[476] belonging to Neil\r\nMacDonald, where there was two country-houses, and conveniency enough\r\nfor his concealment. Neil was appointed for to conduct him thither,\r\nwhom he desired to remain still with him. About eleven aclock at\r\nnight, they set out with Neil, who was their faithful guide, towards\r\nCorrodale, where they arrived next day about six in the afternoon;\r\nwhen they came near the house, Neil left him under a rock while he\r\nwent in to see if there were no strangers there; and finding none\r\nbut Ranald, his brother,[477] who had come thither the day before by\r\nNeil’s own orders, he presently returned where he left the prince, and\r\nconducted him to the house.[478] He seemed extraordinary well pleased\r\nwith the house, which he swore look’t like a palace in comparison of\r\nthe abominable hole they had lately left. He sat upon a seat of green\r\nturf that was made up for him that same evening, and after taking a\r\nrefreshment of gradan bread-and-cheese, and goats milk, upon which he\r\nfed very hearty, he desired his feet to be washed, being extreme dirty,\r\nand very much galled by his night walk; after which he smok’t a pipe of\r\ntobacco and went to bed, which being heather and green rushes, he slept\r\nsoundly ’till twelve next day.\r\n\r\nDuring this stay at Corrodale, which was five weeks,[479] his ordinary\r\nconversation was talking of the army, and of the battle of Colloden,\r\nand the highland chieftains whose lamentable case he deplored very\r\nmuch. One day as he was taking a walk in the morning with Neil\r\nMacDonald only, the subject of their discourse was describing to Neil\r\nthe battle of Colloden, wherein he said his horse was shot under him;\r\nfor (says he) as I was riding up to the right wing, my horse began to\r\nkick, at which I was much surprised, being very quiet, and peaceable\r\nformerly, and looking narrowly to him to see what was the matter with\r\nhim, I observed the blood gushing out of his side. Oh! oh! says I\r\n(speaking of the horse), if this be the story with you, you have no\r\nless than reason to be uneasie, whereupon I was oblidged to dismount\r\nand take another. Then the conversation rowlled upon the order of the\r\nbattle, and how he was forced to condescend to give the right hand to\r\nthe Atholl-men and others, which he knew to be the MacDonald’s right,\r\nmeerly by the perswation of my Lord George Murray, and several others,\r\nbut however he did a great deal of justice and honour to the Mack\r\nDonalds, by assuring Neil they were the last that abandoned the field;\r\nand, moreover, that they would have had certainly been cut all to\r\npieces, had not the pickets come to their relief, to whom he said, they\r\nowe an eternal obligation.\r\n\r\nHe blamed always my Lord George as being the only instrument in\r\nloseing the battle, and altho’ that he, the morning before the action,\r\nused all his rhetorick, and eloquence against fighting, yet my Lord\r\nGeorge outreasoned him, ’till at last he yielded for fear to raise a\r\ndissension among the army, all which he attributed to his infidelity,\r\nroguery, and treachery.[480] He always flattered himself that the\r\nhighlanders were still upon foot to hinder the enemy from harrassing\r\ntheir countrys, and conceived great hopes that they would be able to\r\nstand it out, ’till they got a relief from France. He was so fond\r\nto know what was passing among them, that he sent his boat twice to\r\nMudort[481] for intelligence, and hearing of a skirmish betwixt Cluny\r\nMacPherson and a party of the elector’s troops in Badanack, of which\r\nCluny had the better, it gave him no small joy: he had notice given him\r\nlikewise that Borrisdale, upon whose courage and conduct he lay a great\r\nstress, was at the head of about three thousand men in Glenkuaak.[482]\r\nAll these, and manny such like stories kept him still in top spirits,\r\ntogether with the expectation of a French landing in England, where\r\nhe perswaded himself the Duke of York was landed at the head of ten\r\nthousand French, and assured those who durst not contradict him of the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nIt gave him a great deal of pleasure to look to the ships that passed\r\nin the Chanel every day, which he flattered himself to be French,\r\nthough they were really some of the English fleet sent thither to\r\nguard the coast, and hinder any of the Highlanders to escape, and\r\nwould have Neil to go and pilot to some harbour that they might not\r\nbe lost. It was wonderfull how he preserved his health all the time,\r\nnotwithstanding all the fatigue and troubles he underwent and the bad\r\nusage he met with very often; for I have not seen him one hour sick all\r\nthe time I have had the honour to accompany him, save only eight days\r\nhe was troubled with a flux, which kept him very busie while it lasted;\r\nhe had always a good appetite, and could eat any meat that came in his\r\nway, as well as those who was accustomed to it from their infancy. He\r\ntook care to warm his stomach every morning with a hearty bumper of\r\nbrandy, of which he always drank a vast deal; for he was seen to drink\r\na whole bottle of a day without being in the least concerned.\r\n\r\nHe took a vast delight, when it was a good day, to sit up a stone that\r\nwas before the door of the house, with his face turned towards the sun;\r\nand when he was desired to move from thence fearing to get a headache,\r\nhe ordered them to pack about their business, that he knew himself what\r\nwas good for him, better than they could describe, that the sun did him\r\nall the good in the world. Notwithstanding his melancholy fits, yet\r\nat other times he was so hearty and merry, that he danced for a whole\r\nhour together, having no other musick but some highland reel which\r\nhe whistled away as he tripped along. It happened one day as he was\r\nwalking along the coast with Neil and the rest of the gentlemen, being\r\nan excessive hot day, they spied a number of young whales approaching\r\npretty near the shore, and observing them to make straight for the\r\nrock whereon they sat down, he sent immediately for his fusee, and as\r\nthey came within his reach he fired at them; and being informed some\r\ntime before that Neil was an incomparable good swimmer, he ordered him\r\nto strip and hall ashore the whale, which he swore he had shot dead.\r\nNeil, in obedience to his orders and to humour him, began to strip very\r\nslowly till he saw the whale which had received no hurt out of sight.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay at Corrodale, Clanranald paid him several visits, as\r\nalso all the gentlemen of the country, who sent him presents of all\r\nthey possessed. As he now despared of any assistance from abroad, and\r\nwishing to be out of the Highlands, he thought of setting about getting\r\na ship to transport himself out of the kingdom. In order thereunto, he\r\nsent off Mr. O’Neil and Captain Donald MacDonald, Clanranald’s son,\r\nwho joined him at his return from the Lewis, in order to go to France,\r\nthinking to get passage from the Lewis privately, to either Sweden or\r\nDenmark, from whence they were to pass into France.\r\n\r\nHaving received fifty guineas each to defray their charges, they set\r\nout for the Herris, where they were no sooner arrived but O’Neil, who\r\nwas there with the prince before, was immediately known, and if he\r\nhad not made his escape back to Benbicula, he had been apprehended\r\nwithout going any further, whereupon he returned to the prince, who did\r\nnot care much for him ever after. Captain MacDonald, who pursued his\r\njourney towards the Lewis, met with the same fate at Stornaway, there,\r\nhaving found his uncle, Alexander MacLeod,[483] he carried him with him\r\nto his own house, where he lay concealed for a long time after, and\r\nreturned to the prince no more.\r\n\r\nThe enemy, who was not idle all this time to inform themselves about\r\nhim, got sufficient intelligence that he was in Wist, disposed of\r\nthemselves so that it seemed impracticable for him to escape. That\r\nhe might lose no time, he sent Neil as minister plenipotentiary to\r\nBoystile,[484] to treat with him to procure a boat for him, and\r\nsufficient hands for to manage it, in case of accidence--for now he\r\nwas to attempt to gain the mainland, seeing there was no safety for\r\nhim in Wist. Boystile, who did not go near him all the time for fear\r\nof suspicion, sent him back word with Neil, that he himself would come\r\nin person and consult with him what was properest to be done. Boystile\r\ncame next day, and was received by the prince with open arms, and\r\nfound some of the gentlemen of the country who came to see him the day\r\nbefore, of whose number was Hugh Macdonald, of Ballissher, from North\r\nWist,[485] who was ready to sacrifice his life and fortune for the\r\nprince’s safety (I say), Boystile at his arrival found all these lying\r\nin their bed, very much disordered by the foregoing night’s carouse,\r\nwhile his royal highness was the only one who was able to take care of\r\nthe rest, in heaping them with plaids, and at the same time merrily\r\nsung the _De Profundis_ for the rest of their souls.[486]\r\n\r\nNeil, who was straggling every day about the neighbouring towns for\r\nintelligence, and who never missed to come in seasonable time with what\r\nnews he gathered among the people, arrived, as the Prince, Boystile,\r\nand the other gentlemen were very busie and very hearty taking their\r\nbottle. It was always the prince’s custom whenever Neil returned from\r\nany expedition, to learn from him privately what news he brought\r\nbefore it was made public. Neil told him that two hundred of the Sky\r\nmilitia, head’d by Hugh Macdonald, of Armidale,[487] and Alexander\r\nMacLeod of Ullish,[488] was landed at Barra, who was sent thither by\r\nmy Lord Lowdian. Campbell, and MacLeod, having had an information that\r\nthe prince was sculking in that country, and that these gentlemen’s\r\norders were, after a diligent search made in Barra, to pass into South\r\nWist, and to stay there guarding the coasts and foords in the country\r\n’till they were reinforced by a greater number, and, moreover, that\r\nCaptain Ferguson[489] was ordered to the Lewis for the same purpose,\r\nCaptain MacKenzie to the Herris, and the _Baltimore_ to cruize upon\r\nthe coast of Wist, so that it seemed next to a miracle to have been\r\nable to escape. The prince, who always appeared very gay and cheerful,\r\nnotwithstanding his crosses and misfortunes, was very much dejected at\r\nthis news; which Boystile observing, begged of him to be in no ways\r\nuneasie, that the danger was not so great as what he apprehended, and\r\nthat he, despite of all the search of the enemy, would procure a place\r\nfor him where he would not be exposed to the least danger till such\r\ntime as a more favourable opportunity offered for making his escape;\r\nand fearing least the enemy might surprise them, being now three days\r\nin the country, Boystile took leave of him in order to prevent their\r\ncoming so suddenly till he got time to fit into some other place.\r\n\r\nNeil fearing the fickleness and the inconstancy of the common people,\r\nwho might perhaps be perverted from their fidelity to discover him\r\nto his enemies, in hopes of a great reward, did not think proper to\r\nstay there any longer; whereupon, having got into their boat, which\r\nthey always had nigh them, they set out about eleven o’clock at night,\r\nwithout acquainting any body of their design, except those who were\r\npartakers of it, and took the retreat towards Benbicula, and landed\r\nabout break of day in Fuyia,[490] a desert island, about three miles\r\nfrom Roshiness, where they sculked for eight days.\r\n\r\nDuring their stay in this solitude, he kept a private correspondence\r\nwith Boystile about leaving the country, as it appeared impossible for\r\nhim to conceal himself any longer from those cursed villains who left\r\nnot a stone unturned to find him out. Boystyle, who used all endeavours\r\nto effect his design to get him safely conveyed to the mainland, lost\r\nno time to provide whatever necessaries their voyage required; when\r\nunluckily he himself was taken prisoner and carried away on board the\r\n_Baltimore_, so that that design perished, and came to nothing.\r\n\r\nUpon the news of Boystile’s being made prisoner[491] he expressed a\r\ngreat deal of regret for him, saying it was a great pity he should\r\nfall into the hands of such ruffians, who would have no regard for his\r\nmerit, for really he was the honestest man (said he) I met with since\r\nmy stay in the isles. While he stayed upon the island he went about\r\nthe shore once or twice a day, to see if he could find out which was\r\nthe most commodious hole or cave for hiding him in case some of the\r\nmen of war that kept the channel still came to land any men. There he\r\nhad occasion to see the Lady Clanranald, who came from Roshiness to\r\nhave the honour of seeing him before he left the country, and carried\r\nalong with her to him some of what necessaries he wanted: he received\r\nher very kindly, made much of her, and thanked her for her generosity,\r\ntelling her next day at parting that he would not forget soon what\r\nkindness he met with in the country. They had plenty of bread and other\r\nmeats during their retreat in that Patmos, but before the eight days\r\nwas expired they were obliged to leave the hole to another party of the\r\nMacLeods who landed upon the island from Skay.\r\n\r\nAfter being chased from thence they had no other resource but to return\r\ntowards the south end of the country, upon hearing that the Skay\r\nmilitia had departed from Boystile’s house two days before, and were\r\nupon their march towards Benbicula, where they flattered themselves\r\ninfallibly sure to find him. About eight o’clock at night, upon the\r\n12th of July, they put to sea from Lochaskivay, and rowed the whole\r\nnight along the coast, and as the day began to dawn Neil advised them\r\nto land in Lochskiport, and to stay there ’till it was late; but the\r\nprince, who was eager to be as far on that day as possibly he could,\r\nwould not condescend, and so continued their voyage the whole day.\r\nAbout five in the afternoon they landed at Corrodale, where they\r\nrefreshed themselves ’till it was ten, and arrived next morning at\r\nsunrise at the mouth of Lochynort, in South-Wist; they had not so much\r\nas one mouthful to eat that night of any kind, and having made up a\r\ntent of the oars and sail of the boat, he laid himself down upon a kind\r\nof a heather bed that was made for him, while Neil stood sentry upon\r\nthe rock before the tent door the whole night, after he had placed two\r\nof the crew whom he could trust most to about a mile off as an advanced\r\nguard.\r\n\r\nWhen it was near day he asked Neil whether it was possible to find any\r\nmeat, who told him it was impracticable, by reason the nearest town lay\r\nfive miles off, whereupon he roused up the rest, and got into the boat\r\nand rowed to Stialay, a small island near the entry of Loch Boystile,\r\nwithin three long miles of Boystile’s house, being the 14th of July\r\nin the evening. They were no sooner landed and the tent made, than\r\nNeil posted off immediately to Boystile’s house for provisions; when\r\nhe arrived, he found all the family in bed, and having knocked them\r\nup, he acquainted Boystile’s daughter who came first to the door with\r\nthe princes being upon the Island of Stialay, where he had but very\r\nill accommodation. She ran into the room where her stepmother[492] was\r\nin bed, bringing Neil along with her, who told the lady the miserable\r\ncondition his royal highness was in, she got up in the greatest hurry,\r\nand sent off what was readiest to relieve them in the mean time, ’till\r\nsuch time she could get more prepared against the next night. Neil\r\nreturned, charging the lady at parting, to learn what was passing among\r\nthe enemy, and to inform them accordingly.\r\n\r\nAt his arrival he found the boat ashore waiting him, and having passed\r\nto the island, the prince met him at his landing, and asked of him if\r\nhe got any meat. Neil told him that he brought some fresh butter and\r\ncheese and a few bottles of brandy. ‘Come, come,’ said he, ‘give me\r\none of the bottles and a piece of the bread, for I was never so hungry\r\nsince I was born’; which being given him, he took two or three hearty\r\npulls of it before he came near the rest, which gave him so good an\r\nappetite, that he eat that night more than ever he was seen to eat at\r\nthree ordinary meals, and all the rest did proportionably. After supper\r\nhe called for the brandy-bottles, and drank the king’s and the duke’s\r\nhealths; which done, he wrapt himself in his plaid, laid down, and\r\nslept away the remaining part of the night very soundly.\r\n\r\nNext morning there was a consultation held concerning the course they\r\nwere to take from thence. Some were of opinion that they should venter\r\nto run for the continent in the small boat they had, of which the\r\nprince himself approved very much, saying he would rather drown than\r\nfall into the hands of those profligate fellows who were in pursuit of\r\nhim. Others were of opinion that the safest step they could take was,\r\nto make for some one of the Southren Isles of Barra, and the rather\r\nbecause the first party who came after him to the country landed first\r\nin that island, and it seemed very probable that they would not return\r\nthere again. They all agreed to this last proposal, and that no time\r\nmight be lost, they prepared every thing to set off next day, if the\r\nweather favoured them. This project came to nothing as well as the\r\nformer, for the Lady Boystile sent an express that same afternoon, that\r\none Captain Scott[493] was landed at Barra from Fort William, with a\r\ndetachment of regular troops, in order to join the Skay militia in\r\nSouth-Wist, and that they intended, according as she was informed, to\r\nbe at her house by ten o’clock next day, which she would inform him of,\r\nif possible, whatever happened.\r\n\r\nThis news put them in a greater consternation than ever, which obliged\r\nthem to cross over to the other side of Loch Boystile that night for\r\nthe more security. Next day about break of day, the prince sent off\r\nRory MacDonald to learn whither Scott was arrived, and to bring back\r\nword what was passing among them. Rory returned at eight o’clock, and\r\ntold the prince that the lady, her daughter, and all the servants,\r\nwere tied neck and heel in one house, in order to extort a confession\r\nfrom them of the prince’s being in the country; while her seller and\r\nall her most valuable effects were left to the mercy of the ungenerous\r\nsoldiers, who were busie in carrying the plunder to their boats. The\r\nnews of the ladies ill-treatment struck such a terror into the minds of\r\nthe timorous crew, that they immediately sunk the boat, and abandoned\r\nthe prince and the few gentlemen who accompanied him. In this desperate\r\ncondition there was no remedy to be thought upon, but to dismiss the\r\nfew gentlemen that accompanied till then, and retire to the mountains;\r\nwhereupon having left every body to shift for himself (of whose number\r\nwas O’Sullivan, who was left under a rock with the best part of the\r\nprince’s baggage), the prince, with Neil and MacO’Neil,[494] made for\r\nthe top of the nearest hill, that from thence they might have a better\r\nview of their enemies motion, and take further resolution how they were\r\nto dispose of themselves next.[495]\r\n\r\nI forgot to tell that when Captain Scott landed in South-Wist, Hugh\r\nMacDonald,[496] who lay in Benbicula then with his party, sent one of\r\nthe country gentlemen in whom he could repose a great deal of trust,\r\nto tell the prince privately that, as it seemed now impossible for him\r\nto conceal himself any longer in the country, if he would venter to be\r\nadvised by him, though an enemy in appearance yet a sure friend in his\r\nheart, he would fall upon a scheme to convoy him to the Isle of Skay,\r\nwhere he was sure to be protected by Lady Margaret MacDonald.[497] The\r\nscheme was this: to send his stepdaughter, Miss Florence MacDonald, to\r\nSleet, to live with her mother ’till the enemy was out of Wist. The\r\nprince at the same time was ordered to dress in woman’s close, that he\r\nmight pass for her servant-maid, and Neil was appointed to take care\r\nof both. The scheme pleased the prince mightely, and he seemed very\r\nimpatient to see it put in execution.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the top of the hill, the prince with Neil and Mr.\r\nO’Neil remained there the whole day. About sunset the prince told Neil\r\nthat he entrusted himself in his hands, and that his life and safety\r\ndepended upon him, Neil answered that the charge was more than what his\r\nlife was worth; but yet, with God’s assistance that he would find means\r\nto preserve him from all danger till every thing was got ready to leave\r\nthe country. After this they took a refreshment of bread-and-cheese,\r\nand set out towards the north end of the country, every body carrying\r\nhis own share of the baggage, the prince carried his own few shirts,\r\nO’Neill carried his own linnen, and Neil carried the provision, his own\r\ngun and sword, and the prince’s fusee and one of his holsters, while\r\nthe other hung upon his own belt. As they were going on, the prince\r\nclapt Neil’s shoulder, often telling him if ever it was their good\r\nfortune to get free of their present troubles, he would make him live\r\neasie all his days for the fatigue of that night. Neil was informed\r\nsome days before, that Miss Flora lived with her brother in a glen\r\nnear Locheynort, where they had all their cattle a grazing at that\r\ntime, and which happened to be very near the rod they were to pass that\r\nnight.[498]\r\n\r\nWhen the prince was informed of it, he would needs go to see her, and\r\ntell her of the message he had from her stepfather. When they were\r\nnear the little house where she was asleep, for her brother was not at\r\nhome, Neil left the prince and O’Neil at a little distance off,’till\r\nhe went in and wakened her; she got scarcely on the half of her close,\r\nwhen the prince, with his baggage upon his back, was at the door, and\r\nsaluted her very kindly; after which she brought to him a part of the\r\nbest cheer she had, among the rest was a large bowl full of creme, of\r\nwhich he took two or three hearty go-downs, and his fellow-travellers\r\nswallowed the rest.\r\n\r\nHe discovered to her her stepfather’s proposal, and ask’t whether she\r\nwas willing to run the risque. She joyfully accepted of the offer\r\nwithout the least hesitation, and that no time might be lost, she was\r\nordered immediately away to Benbicula to consult with her step-father\r\nand the Lady Clanranald, to get every thing in readiness as soon as\r\npossible, and to send them word back again next day how all was going\r\non with them. Having taken leave of Miss Flora, they pursued their\r\njourney, and about sunrise they arrived upon the side of a hill three\r\nmiles from Corrodale, where they sate down under a rock in order to\r\ntake some rest. The prince, as he took no victuals the night before,\r\ncomplained of hunger, and ask’t of Neil if he had any thing to eat;\r\nNeil gave him a piece of bread-and-cheese that Miss MacDonald had given\r\nhim the night before. After he eat of it very heartily, he laid himself\r\ndown and slept, while Neil stood sentry upon him all the time; when he\r\nand O’Neil was sufficiently rested, he ordered Neil to take some rest,\r\nand sent O’Neil to mount guard in his turn.\r\n\r\nWhen it was drawn late, the prince ask’t Neil if there was any\r\npossibility of getting any supper; Neil told him he would find enough,\r\nand leaving the prince and O’Neil under the same rock, he went and\r\nbought abundance of such cheer as the neighbourhood could afford. The\r\nprince was prodigious impatient the whole afternoon for Miss Flora’s\r\nanswer, and despairing to hear a word from her that night, he sent off\r\nNeil, at eight o’clock at night, to Benbicula, with strict orders to\r\nbe back next day at four in the afternoon, under pain of gaining his\r\ndispleasure for ever. Neil, notwithstanding the fatigue and the length\r\nof the journey (which was thirty miles backward and forward), willingly\r\ncondescended.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at the fourds which seperates Benbicula from South\r\nWist,[499] he found them all guard’d by the Skay militia, who had\r\nplaced sentries within a gun shot of each other from east to west;\r\ntheir consigne was to let pass no person whatsoever until he was\r\nexamined first by the captain of the guard; by this means Neil was\r\nstopped, and was kept prisoner there till next morning, when it was\r\nlow water Neil was sent away to the captain of the guard on the other\r\nside, who happened to be Hugh MacDonald; when Neil went in he found\r\nMiss MacDonald, who was stopped in the same manner by another party\r\nof the MacLeods, who had the guard two nights before, with some other\r\ngentlemen at breakfast with Mr. MacDonald. Neil call’d miss aside,\r\nand ask’t if every thing was ready, she told him as it was put out of\r\nher power to go on the length of the Lady Clanranald, that nothing\r\nwas as yet done, but that she was going off within half an hour after\r\nto consult with the lady, and designed to go to Roshiness, both of\r\nthem, that same afternoon, and carry along with them whatever clothes\r\nor provisions was requisite for the voyage, and she begg’d of Neil\r\nto make all the hast possible to return to the prince, and, without\r\nlosing one moment of time, to make the best of his way to Rosshiness,\r\nwhere he would be sure to find them without fail.\r\n\r\nNeil posted off immediately, and arrived at the prince at the hour he\r\nhad appointed, and found him under the same rock where he had left him;\r\nhe no sooner saw Neil come in sight than he ran to meet him, and took\r\nhim by the hand asking what news he had from Miss Flora; Neil told him\r\nwhat orders he had from the lady (as he called Miss Flora), after which\r\nthey set out for Roshiness. The greatest difficulty for this journey\r\nwas to find a boat to go by sea, as it was impossible to venture by\r\nland, because, as I have already told, all the fourds were guarded by\r\nthe MacLeods; but God, who always provided whatever he had occasion\r\nfor, removed this difficulty also, for when they arrived at the side of\r\nLochskiport, there they found four country people who had come there\r\nsome days before to fish, with a small yawl.\r\n\r\nNeil knew them immediately, and agreed with them for to ferry him\r\nand two other gentlemen that were with him over to Fouay, where they\r\nexpected to meet with Ranald MacDonald (called Walpole);[500] but\r\nwhen they landed upon the island they found no living soul of either\r\nman or beast upon it; being, at this time, clear daylight, they could\r\nnot bring the boat no further, for fear to be seen from the land,\r\nwherefore they ordered the boat men to land them on the nearest rock\r\nof Benbicula, that from thence they might go afoot to Roshiness, which\r\ndone, Neil payed the boatmen and sent them away home.\r\n\r\nThe prince sate down upon the rock where they had land’d, and, being\r\nquite overcome for want of rest, he fell asleep, and so did O’Neil;\r\nduring the time they slept Neil thought proper to take a walk round\r\nabout for fear that any body should come upon them at any unawares;\r\nbut he had not gone ten yards from them, when he observed an arm of\r\nthe sea come in betwixt him and the rest of the land, which formed an\r\nisland; he returned immediately and informed the prince, who started\r\nup like a mad man and walked to the end of the island at such a rate\r\nas if he had a mind to fly over to the other side, but his career was\r\nsoon stopped; whereupon he fell a scoulding Neil as if it had been his\r\nfault, and the curse rascals (meaning the boatmen) who land’d them\r\nupon that desert island designedly that he might starve with hunger\r\nand cold, in short, there was no pacifying him till, at last, Neil\r\ntold him to comfort himself, that he would sweem over to the other\r\nside and would bring a boat in half an hour’s time, from that moment\r\nhe never gave Neil one minute’s rest, till, to please him, he began to\r\nstrip, notwithstanding that it rained most prodigiously, when luckily\r\nNeil observed a rock appearing in the middle of the sound, and begg’d\r\nof the prince to allow him a little more time, that it seem’d very\r\nprobable at low water they could pass over with dry feet without being\r\nobliged to hazard his life by sweeming, which was to be the ultimate\r\nresource, which happened accordingly, for in less than three quarters\r\nof an hour’s time, they passed over without wetting the soles of their\r\nshoes.[501]\r\n\r\nThe prince seem’d as well pleased when he got out of that labyrinth as\r\nif he was landed in France; he was so cold (for the rain pierced to his\r\nvery skin) that he trembled, the moor being so plain that there was\r\nnot the least bush, eminence, or hill to cover him from the weather,\r\nand he was so hungry that he was not able to walk, having eaten not\r\na mouthful of any kind since the evening before. In this deplorable\r\ncondition it was hard to determine how to behave, but as there was no\r\ntime to be lost, despite of rain and weather, he continued his journey\r\nfor Roshiness, where he expected to find the ladies before him that\r\nnight. When they had walkt about a quarter of a mile, they lighted\r\naccidentally upon two sheelings, where two of Clanranald’s tennants\r\nstay’d, who, seeing them coming, came to meet them. Neil, to prevent\r\ntheir coming too nigh, stept on and met them; they enquired what were\r\nthese other two that came along with him.\r\n\r\nNeil satisfied their curiosity by telling them they were poor Irish\r\ngentlemen, who made their escape from Culloden, and run to the country\r\nfor shelter, and that it was an act of charity if they had any kind of\r\neatables to give them some refreshment, for that they had not tasted\r\nmeat for eight-and-forty hours before, whereupon the honest fellows\r\norder’d them to go in; the door of the hut was so low and narrow, that\r\nthe prince was obliged to creep upon his belly. There they feasted\r\nsplendidly upon such cheer as there was to be had, which was mostly\r\nmilk kind; being thus sufficiently refreshed they went off, and as\r\nNeil was not thoroughly acquainted in that rod, he brought one of the\r\nfellows with him for a guide to whom he gave half a guinea for his\r\npains. When they were within three miles of Roshiness, being at that\r\ntime five in the afternoon, they laid down in a lock side among high\r\nheather, which was all the shelter they had from the rain.\r\n\r\nThere they past the remaining part of the day, the prince shivering\r\nwith cold all the time. When it was late, they set out for Rosshiness,\r\nthe night turned so dark that they could not see three yards before\r\nthem, and the rain was so vehement, with the wind blowing directly in\r\ntheir teeth, that they could scarcely look where to set their foot;\r\nbesides the rod was so very bad, that the prince, despite of what care\r\nNeil and O’Neil could take of him, fell at almost every step in some\r\nditch or mire, where, very often, he lost his shoes, which gave Neil\r\na vast deal of trouble and pains before he could fish them up again,\r\nbeing sometimes obliged to put his hand to the very shoulder in the\r\npuddle for them.\r\n\r\nAfter having surmounted all these troubles and difficulties, they at\r\nlast arrived in the long wished for harbour. When they came near the\r\nhouse, Neil left the prince and O’Neil about a cannon-shot off, while\r\nhe himself went in to see whether the ladies were come; but finding\r\nnone but the man who took care of the house in bed with his wife, who\r\ntold him that twenty of the Skay militia who landed there two days\r\nbefore, were in a tent about a quarter of a mile of the house, he\r\nreturned to the prince with that dismal news, which so enraged him,\r\nthat he was like to tear his clothes in pieces, not knowing where to\r\nrun for safety, the enemy being every where.\r\n\r\nThe guide, though he did not understand the language they spoke, yet\r\nunderstood the confusion they were in, told them there was one of\r\nClanranald’s boomen[502] not far off, into whose house they might go\r\nwith safety till they came to a further resolution. They immediately\r\nbetook themselves thither, and I leave the reader to judge what a bonny\r\nfigure they made when they came to examine themselves before light, all\r\nbespattered with dirt and mud, after the foregoing night’s walk. There\r\nhe resolved to return Neil to Nuntown[503] to inform Miss MacDonald\r\nthat he was arrived, and to hasten her to come without any longer delay.\r\n\r\nNeil, who foresaw clearly the danger he would be exposed to, if he\r\nwas left with a man who knew not one step of the country, or where to\r\nretire to in case of necessity, absolutely denied to part with the\r\nprince upon any account, and so Mr. O’Neill was obliged to go upon\r\nthat expedition; who was mighty well pleased to be entrusted with that\r\nembassy, not so much to further the prince’s affairs, as to be in\r\ncompany with Miss Flora, for whom he professed a great deal of kindness\r\nat that time. About break of day, the Booman’s wife told Neil that\r\nit was dangerous for them to stay in the house any longer because the\r\nmilitia were wont to come every morning to buy milk, whereupon Neil and\r\nhis pupil went and lodged under a rock pretty near the shore, where the\r\nBooman sent one of his derry maids to give them notice from time to\r\ntime, what was passing among their neighbour enemies.\r\n\r\nIt is almost inexpressible what torment the prince suffered under that\r\nunhappy rock which had neither height nor bredth to cover him from\r\nthe rain which poured down upon him so thick as if all the windows of\r\nheaven had broke open, and, to compleat his tortures, there lay such a\r\nswarm of mitches upon his face and hands as would have made any other\r\nbut himself fall into despair, which, notwithstanding his incomparable\r\npatience, made him utter such hideous cries and complaints as would\r\nhave rent the rocks with compassion.\r\n\r\nNeil, who stood all this time aside him, could be of no more service\r\nto him than to let run to the ground the rain which stagnated in the\r\nlurks of the plaid wherein he lay wrapt. In this miserable condition he\r\ncontinued for about three hours, till their faithful scoote came for\r\nthe last time, and told them they might return to the house, for that\r\nthe militia was gone; Neil helped him to his feet, and they marched\r\naway to the house, where the good derrymaid took care to make a roozing\r\nfire for their coming. He was no sooner entered but Neil stripped him\r\nof all his clothes from top to toe, and hung rops round the house to\r\ndry them on; he sate down in his shirt at the fireside as merry and\r\nhearty as if he was in the best room at Whitehall.\r\n\r\nAfter he had warmed himself, he desired Neil to ask the wife if she had\r\nany eatables. She said that she had nothing except a chapin of milk she\r\nkept for her bairns, which Neil desired her to warm in a pot, and when\r\nit was hot to froth it up with the machine made for that purpose. When\r\nall was ready, the wife placed the pot before the prince and Neil, and\r\ngave them two horn spoons as coarse as ever was made use of, the prince\r\nask’t Neil what it was, who told it was fresh creme, he not doubting\r\nbut it was really so, and at the same time believing it to be solid,\r\npushed his hand to the very wrist in the scalded milk, which made him\r\ndraw back his hand in the greatest hurry, all full of wrath, and dropt\r\nhis spoon in the pot. Neil had all the difficulty imaginable to keep\r\nhis gravity, to hear him curse the wife and her pot a hundred times,\r\ncalling her a vile witch for (says he) she contrived it a purpose that\r\nwe might burn ourselves. Neil, seeing him altogether out of humour,\r\nin order to pacify him, told he would take a stick and labour her to\r\nan inch of her life with it, and immediately ran to an oar of the\r\nboat that was lying before him to knock out her brains. The prince,\r\nbelieving him to be serious, begged of him not to touch her, for, if he\r\ncame to do her any hurt, she would certainly run off and bring a party\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nAfter this repas, the prince inclined to sleep a little, as he rested\r\nnone the night before; but to get a bed for him was the question--in\r\nshort, there was no better shift than to take the leaf of the door,\r\nand lay it down upon the floor, and spread an old ragged sail over\r\nit, which Neil found in the house; there he slept some hours wrapt in\r\nhis wet plaid. The guide, who went with O’Neil the night before to\r\nClanranald’s house, returned towards evening, who brought along with\r\nhim a rosted fowl, and a couples of bottles of wine, and a letter from\r\nO’Neil to the prince, the contents of which I could not find out,\r\nthough it’s very probable he excused himself for not returning, under\r\npretence to hasten all matters for leaving the country. The prince\r\nsupp’t very heartily upon what the lady had sent him, and afterwards\r\nslept soundly upon a heather bed, which Neil made for him.\r\n\r\nNext morning the prince wrote a letter to O’Neil by the same post that\r\nbrought the former, desiring him to come to him that night; but O’Neil\r\ncontented himself to return him an answer by the same bearer, telling\r\nhim he could not come by reason that he waited Miss McDonald and the\r\nLady Clanranald, who was to come next day without fail.\r\n\r\nThe prince waited that day in the house of Roshiness. Next morning Neil\r\ncarried him to a hill half way betwixt Roshiness and Nuntown;[504]\r\nthere they lay till the evening, when they returned to their former\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nThe prince seemed very uneasie that night that neither Mac O’Neil nor\r\nthe ladys did not come according to promise; but the truth is, thay\r\ncould not really come sooner, as they were busie night and day to get\r\nhis dress made for the prince, and whatever other things he might have\r\noccasion for. The next day Rory McDonald, and one John McDonald, who\r\nwere to be two of our crew, arrived in the morning, and told that both\r\nboat and crew were ready whenever he pleased.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Neil carried the prince to the same hill where they had\r\nsculked the day before, and leaving him in the hands of the two\r\nMcDonalds before mentioned, posted off himself to hurry the ladys\r\nfrom Nuntown, and sent off O’Neil directly to the place where he left\r\nthe prince when himself went with the Lady Clan, Miss Flora McDonald,\r\nClanranald’s daughter, and Mr. McDonald of Milltown, Miss Flora’s\r\nbrother, about another rod, where they were to have the conveniency of\r\na boat to Roshiness.\r\n\r\nThe prince, who arrived first, welcomed them ashore, and handed the\r\nLady Clan to the house, while O’Neil took care of Miss Flora. There\r\nthey passed some hours very hearty and merry till supper was served,\r\nwhich was scarce began, when one of Clanranald’s herds came with the\r\nnews that General Campbell[505] was landing his men within three\r\nmiles of them. The supper thus ended, which was hardly begun--all run\r\nto their boat in the greatest confusion, every one carrying with him\r\nwhatever part of the baggage came first to his hand, without either\r\nregard to sex or quality, they crossed Lochisguiway,[506] and, about\r\nfive in the morning, landed on the other side, where they ended the\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\nAbout eight a servant came to the Lady Clanranald to acquaint her that\r\nGeneral Campbell, with a party of his men, were at her house, and\r\nwanted that she should be there before twelve of the clock otherwise\r\nthat her house should suffer for all. Here the lady and her daughter\r\ntook leave of the prince and went off. Great was the debate betwixt\r\nMiss Flora and O’Neil upon this occasion, who insisted strongly to\r\nleave the country with the prince; but Miss McDonald would never\r\ncondescend, because he being a stranger, and consequently did not speak\r\nthe language of the country, would readily be taken notice of by the\r\ncommon sort, and so took leave of the prince and Miss, made the best of\r\nhis way to South Wist along with Milltown.\r\n\r\nThe company being gone, the prince, stript of his own cloaths, was\r\ndressed by Miss Flora in his new attire, but could not keep his hands\r\nfrom adjusting his head dress, which he cursed a thousand times.\r\nThere they lay till the evening, waiting impatiently for the night to\r\nset off. Here they were alarmed by five wherries, the same, as they\r\nsupposed, that landed the Campbells the night before in Benbicula,\r\nsupposing, by taking this precaution, to keep the prince from making\r\nhis escape. But their fears were soon over; for the wherries sailed\r\nby to the southward without ever stopping. After sunset they got into\r\ntheir boat, which was managed by the following persons--Rory McDonald,\r\nJohn McDonald, John McMurich, Duncan Campbell, and Rory McDonald of\r\nGlengary family; the prince passed for Miss McDonald’s maid, and Neil\r\nMcDonald in the quality of a servant.[507]\r\n\r\nThe weather proving calm in the beginning of the night, they rowed away\r\nat a good rate; but, about twelve, there blew a gale of westerly wind,\r\nwhich eased the Rowers not little, but at the same time there came on\r\nsuch thick mist as robbed them of the sight of all lands; great was\r\nthe debate among the boatmen upon this occasion, some asserted that\r\nthey lost their course, while others maintained the contrary, till\r\ntheir dispute end’d at last to cease rowing till day would decide their\r\nerror. In the morning, the weather being quite clear, they rowed along\r\nthe coast of Sky, but the wind, shifting about to the north, blew at\r\nnine o’clock so strong in their teeth, that for an hour and a half it\r\nwas impossible to discern whether they made any way or not.\r\n\r\nThe prince, who, all this time, was not in the least discouraged,\r\nencouraged them to row still better, saying that he would relieve him\r\nthat was most fatigued. The poor men, almost ready to breathe out their\r\nlast, at length made the point of Watersay on the north corner of the\r\nIsle of Sky, where, having got into a cliff in a rock, they rested\r\nthemselves for an hour, and at the same time revived their drooping\r\nspirits with a plentiful repas of bread and butter, while the water\r\nthat fell from the top of the rock furnished them drink.\r\n\r\nThis gave them fresh vigour for to undertake the remaining part of\r\ntheir labour, the weather being quite calm again, they rowed round the\r\npoint close by the land. They had not gone far on the other side, when\r\nthey spyed two centrys upon shore, one of whom approached nearer, and\r\nordered them to put to, but they rowed the faster; which he observing,\r\nadvanced as far as the sea would permitt him, bad them put to, a\r\nsecond time in a more threatning manner, and seeing them like not to\r\nobey, he cocked his piece, which he thought to fire upon them, but, as\r\nProvidence ordered it, she misgave, and so he was disappointed. The\r\nother who look’d on all this time, made to heels to a neighbouring\r\nvillage, about a cannon shot off, to acquaint their officer (if there\r\nwas any) of what had happened.\r\n\r\nThe boatmen, justly judging what he was going about, made them now row\r\nfor dear blood. They very soon saw the event of their conjectures, for\r\na body of about fifteen men, full armed, marched straight from the\r\nvillage to the rock, where their centry was post’d, and if they had the\r\npresence of mind to launch out one of their boats (of which they had\r\ntwo close by them) we must have been inevitably taken.\r\n\r\nThe prince by this time was sensible of his error in not allowing\r\nthe men at parting from Uist to have any arms in the boat, which if\r\nthey had had, were fully resolved to fight it out to the last man,\r\nnotwithstanding the inequality of numbers. The enemy seeing it quite\r\nout of their power to execute their design in coming thither, as we\r\ngot fairly out of their reach, took a walk along the shore, without\r\ngiving the prince or crew any uneasiness, further than to gaze at them\r\ntill they landed in Kilbride in Troterniss within a cannon shot of Sir\r\nAlexander McDonald’s house,[508] twelve miles from the place where we\r\nsaw the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of this place was another party of the Sky\r\nmilitia, who was post’d there to examine all boats that came from the\r\nisles, as they were pretty well assured that the prince was there at\r\nthat time. Miss and Neil having kept the prince in the boat as well as\r\nthey could, went to the house, leaving strict orders with the boatmen\r\nnot to stir from it till they came back, or some word from them, and\r\nin case their curiosity led any body thither, who might perhaps take\r\nthe liberty to ask who was the person kept in the boat, to answer Miss\r\nMcDonald’s maid, and to curse her for a lazy jade, what was she good\r\nfor, since she did not attend her Mrs.\r\n\r\nWhen they were come near the house, they were informed by a servant\r\nthat Sir Alexander was gone for Fort Augustus some days before to\r\nwait upon Cumberland, and that there was no company with the lady but\r\ntwo gentlemen, to wit, McDonald of Kingsbourg,[509] and Lieutenant\r\nMcLeod,[510] commander of the party before mentioned, and one Mrs.\r\nMcDonald who came the day before from North Wist, and who was so\r\nstrictly examined by the party upon the point of Waternish (taking her\r\nto be the prince in disguise), that she was at all the pains imaginable\r\nto keep off the soldiers’ hands from examining her person too closely,\r\nwhich must have been the Prince’s fate had he fallen into their hands.\r\n\r\nMiss Flora having met with one Miss McDonald, Lady Margarate’s\r\ngentlewoman, sent her to acquaint her lady that she wanted to speak\r\nto her, who came back and carried Miss Flora to the lady’s apartment,\r\nwhere she told all the circumstances of the prince’s escape from\r\nthe isles, and that she must harbour him as he came now under her\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThe lady, in the greatest perplexity, was at a loss how to behave\r\nupon this occasion, for her hurry and impatience hindred her to fall\r\nupon proper means to get the prince conveyed privately to the house,\r\nespecially at such an improper hour as eleven o’clock of the day.\r\nWhereupon she sent for Kingsborough, to whom she disclosed the whole\r\nsecret. Kingsborough, without being in the least discomposed, explained\r\nto her the danger the prince and her would be exposed to if she\r\ninsisted to have him brought to her house, where she was to entertain\r\none of the king’s officers that day, who could not miss to see and take\r\nnotice of the person in disguise, as well as every body else about the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nHaving got the lady at last to yield, though with great reluctancy, he\r\nordered Neil to return to the prince, and to carry him to the back of\r\na hill, a long mile from the house of Mungstot, and there to wait till\r\nhe came to join them, and ordered that some light clothes should be\r\npackt in the form of a bundle, for the prince to carry on his back, as\r\nif it had been some of Miss Flora’s baggage, which done, they set out\r\nfor the hill, but they had not gone far, when tiring of his burden,\r\nwhich he carried very awkwardly, threw it from him, leaving it for Neil\r\nto carry, or leave, as he should think fit. It was in vain that Neil\r\ninsisted he would take it again, but he would never condescend, saying\r\nthat he had carried it long enough.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the place of meeting they sate down upon the side of\r\na hillock, where they wait’d for Kingsborough. The prince, who was a\r\nlong time silent and very pensive, ask’d Neil whether he had carried\r\nhis case of knives from the boat; Neil, who did not miss them till\r\nthen, answered he had not; ‘Then,’ said the prince, ‘you must return\r\nand look for them.’--‘Shall I for the sakes of all the knives in the\r\nuniverse leave you here all alone?’ reply’d Neil.--‘There will be\r\nno fears of me,’ said he, ‘do you what you are ordered, for I must\r\nabsolutely have it, so no more words.’ Neil still opposed, but in vain;\r\nseeing him at last quite out of humour, and ready to fly in a passion,\r\nwent leaving him there within a gun shot of the high rod, without a\r\nsoul along with him.\r\n\r\nWhen Neil returned he found Kingsborough with him taking a glass of\r\nwine, which Lady Margarate MacDonald had sent by Kingsborough, together\r\nwith some few biscuits of which he ate a little, and gave the rest\r\nto Neil to keep for him till another occasion. About an hour before\r\nsunset they set off for Kingsborough, where they were to be that night.\r\nMiss Flora, who staid for dinner at Mungstot, that she might not be\r\nsuspected by Lieut. MacLeod, followed a horseback at some distance, and\r\nwas mightily diverted to hear several of the country people with whom\r\nshe fell in upon the road, as they returned from the meeting house at\r\nMungstot, it being Sunday, make their remarks upon the behaviour of\r\nBetty Burk, her maid, which name the prince borrowed when he left the\r\nIsle of Wist.\r\n\r\nNeil, who walked a little behind the prince, and Kingsborough, hearing\r\nthe subject the fellows were upon, went slower till they came up and\r\njoined him, but they, notwithstanding, continued to speak with the same\r\nfreedom as before, of the impudence and assurance of Miss Burk, who was\r\nnot ashamed to walk and keep company with Kingsborough, and was no less\r\nvexed than surprised how he took so much notice of her, when he never\r\nminded her mistress, who was so near at hand. Betty, very easie of what\r\nwould be said of her, went on always at such a rate, that she very\r\noften got a piece before her fellow travellers, which gave occasion to\r\nsome of the fellows to cry out, ‘Curse the wretch do you observe, sir\r\n(meaning Neil), what terrible steps she takes, how manly she walks, how\r\ncarelessly she carries her dress,’ and a hundred such like expressions,\r\nwhich they repeated over and over again.\r\n\r\nBut what they most took notice of all was, when Kingsborough and his\r\ncompanion was come to a rivulet about knee deep, which crossed the\r\nhigh rod, to see Burk take up her petty coats so high when she entred\r\nthe water. The poor fellows were quite confounded at this last sight,\r\nwhich made them rail out against Burk, calling her all the names in the\r\nworld, and ask’t of Neil if he was acquainted with her. Neil told them\r\nthat he knew nothing about her further than to hear she was an Irish\r\ngirl who met with Miss MacDonald in Wist, and uppon a report of her\r\nbeing a famous spinister of lint, engaged her for her mother’s use.\r\n\r\nThe honest people soon after departed with Neil and Miss Flora, and\r\nmade for their different homes full of astonish----\r\n\r\n    [_Manuscript ends abruptly._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SHORT NARRATIVE OF THE CONDUCT OF LUDOVICK GRANT OF GRANT DURING THE\r\nREBELLION\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--Many of the letters enclosed by Ludovick Grant as\r\n    appendixes to his narrative are printed in Sir William Fraser’s\r\n    _Chiefs of Grant_. With a few exceptions these have not been\r\n    reprinted here, but a reference is given to where they may be\r\n    found in the second volume of the _Chiefs of Grant_, and a brief\r\n    abstract is given of the more important letters. The letters\r\n    referred to by Ludovick Grant which are not given by Sir William\r\n    Fraser are here printed in full.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SHORT NARRATIVE OF MR. GRANT’S CONDUCT DURING THE REBELLION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first advice that Mr. Grant got that any invasion or insurrection\r\nwas intended was by a letter from Mr. Craigie, at that time his\r\nMajesty’s Advocate,[511] of date 5th August 1745 (Appen. No. 1st),[512]\r\nwhich came to his hands at his House of Grange-Hill in the low Country\r\nof Murray on Saturday 10th, and next day he had an account, that the\r\nyoung Pretender with some forces had actually landed and heard various\r\nand different Reports of their numbers.\r\n\r\nThereupon Sir James Grant and Mr. Grant went Monday the 12th to Castle\r\nGrant. Their country was all the time disarmed by authority of an Act\r\nof Parliament, nor durst they appear in arms otherwise than as Directed\r\nby the Statute, without Rendering themselves obnoxious to the Law, and\r\natt the Mercy of the proper officers, to whom the Execution of it was\r\nCommitted. And they could not but observe, that his Majesty’s Advocate,\r\nhowever well satisfied he was of their zeal, yet makes no insinuation\r\nof their raising their Friends and Clan in arms: on the contrary says\r\nin Generall that at London they have no good opinion of this Country,\r\nand Desires no more of Mr. Grant, than to have a sharp look out, and\r\nsend him Intelligence how matters go. For these Reasons Mr. Grant\r\ncontented himself with calling together the Gentlemen in that country\r\nand causing enquire what arms could be found, should there be occasion\r\nfor using them--\r\n\r\nAnd he was the more confirmed in this opinion by advices he had that\r\nLord President was returned to Culloden and had had Interviews with\r\nSeveralls of his Friends, Chiefs and other Clans, yet he sent no\r\nmessage, nor made any insinuation to Mr. Grant that it was proper for\r\nhim to appear in arms.\r\n\r\nAugust 24th Mr. Grant Received another Letter from Lord Advocate, dated\r\nthe 20th (App. No. 2)[513] in answer to one that Mr. Grant wrote the\r\n15th with such Intelligence as he had then got of the Rebells. In that\r\nLetter he acquaints Mr. Grant that the Troops were in full march from\r\nStirling which he hoped would be soon in Mr. Grant’s Neighbourhood;\r\nbut he gives no authority nor advice to Mr. Grant to arm his Father’s\r\nclan unless that was intended by the Dark and ambiguous words that\r\nfollow, viz. Which with the Assistance of His Majesty’s Friends it is\r\nhoped will restore quiet to the Country. But Mr. Grant was and still is\r\npersuaded that had such been my Lord Advocates meaning his Lordship who\r\nwell knew the Law, and had reason to know in fact that the country was\r\nnot half armed, would have expressed it in very different and plainer\r\nTerms.\r\n\r\nNext Day after the Receipt of this letter Mr. Grant having got advice\r\nthat Sir John Cope with the army under his Command were already past\r\nTay Bridge[514] wrote to Sir John The Letter (App. No. 3),[515] which\r\nhe sent by one of his friends Robert Grant, now Ensign and Adjutant\r\nin Loudouns Regiment, whom he also Informed what number of arms were,\r\naccording to the Reports made to Mr. Grant, found in the Country, and\r\nwhat number of men could be raised on short warning to the end that if\r\nSir John should Demand any Assistance, that Gentleman might be able to\r\ninform him what he could expect.\r\n\r\nThis Gentleman instead of finding Sir John about Delnacardoch or to the\r\nsouthward of it, as Mr. Grant hoped he should, found him at Ruthven\r\nof Badenoch,[516] and Returned to Mr. Grant Monday the 26th at night\r\nwithout any other answer to his Letter than a verball message that Sir\r\nJohn thanked him for it. He further Informed Mr. Grant that Sir John,\r\ninstead of going in quest of the Rebells, was marching to Inverness\r\nto avoid them and that next night he was to encamp in the head of\r\nStrathspey.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Mr. Grant had advice that the Person called Duke of\r\nPerth was in Braemar raising the Highlanders in that country, that the\r\nMackintoshes and M‘Phersons were all in concert with the Rebells[517]\r\nthat their plan was that they, and even the Pretender and the\r\nHighlanders with him, were to march down through Strathspey, and join\r\nPerth, and march through Strathaven, Glenlivet, and into Aberdeenshire\r\nand so Southward before Sir John Cope, raising all the men in the\r\nCountry through which they marched. This obliged Mr. Grant to set about\r\nraising his Friends as fast as possible for Defence of his own country,\r\nwhich upon Sir John’s marching to Inverness behoved to be quite naked\r\nand exposed to them, and Deprived him of the Honour of waiting on Sir\r\nJohn as he intended to have done, when he was encamped in the head of\r\nStrathspey; However as Sir John was quite a stranger to the country,\r\nand there were some Dangerous passes in it he sent three of the\r\nGentlemen of the country to wait on him and with orders to raise 40 or\r\n50 of the men nearest to these grounds to serve him as Guides and give\r\nhim Intelligence and with them to patrole in the Neighbouring Hills,\r\nnot only all Nights but till the Army was quite clear of these Passes,\r\nand out of any kind of Danger from the Rebells; While Mr. Grant at the\r\nsame time was gathering his Friends and cantoning them in the proper\r\npasses, to prevent if possible the Rebells entering his country, they\r\nhaving the very next day or second day after Sir John past made a march\r\nwith six or seven hundred men, that pointed as if that had been their\r\nDesign.\r\n\r\nMr. Grant therefore could not help being greatly surprised with\r\naccounts he had a few days after from Lord Lyon[518] by his letter\r\nwithout date (App. No. 4),[519] ‘that Sir John Cope complained that\r\ntho’ Mr. Grant in his letter wrote him, that he and his people were\r\nready to join and assist him, yet by some fatall advice, he woud\r\nneither join him with one man, nor go near him, and that if he had been\r\njoined but with one hundred or two from each of the Highland Chiftains,\r\nthat he was told by the ministry would join him, he would have done\r\ntheir Business; but instead of that not one man has joined him of which\r\nhe has acquainted the Ministry.’\r\n\r\nLord Lyon must undoubtedly have misunderstood Sir John. A Coppy of Mr.\r\nGrants Letter to him is subjoined (App. No. 3). He had no call nor the\r\nleast Insinuation from Sir John to join him, nor did he know that the\r\nMinistry expected, or had authorised either him or any other Chiftain\r\nof a Clan to raise men in arms to join him.\r\n\r\nBut it seemed still more surprising that tho’ Sir John had not called\r\nfor any assistance from Mr. Grant when he was on his march north,\r\nyet after the Army was at Inverness, and out of all Danger from\r\nthe Rebells, Lord Lyon still prest Mr. Grants marching his men to\r\njoin Sir John at Inverness, and which advice was enforced by Major\r\nGrant,[520] Governour of Fort George, who came on purpose on that\r\naccount to Castle Grant: But as the M‘Phersons and M‘Intoshes were\r\nthen Rising and Glenbucket was in Strathaven and Glenlivet committing\r\nthe Greatest outrages, even burning Houses to force out the Men, such\r\na measure must, without doing the smallest service to the Government,\r\nhave Involved his own Country of Strathspey in absolute ruin. Yet Mr.\r\nGrant agreed with Major Grant, that if Sir John was to march directly\r\nin quest of the Rebells, he would join him with all the men he could\r\npossibly raise, tho’ he could not agree to leave his own Country\r\nExposed, to join Sir John if he was to march where there were no\r\nRebells to be attacked.\r\n\r\nUpon the Intelligence that Mr. Grant had of Glenbucket levying men in\r\nStrathaven, and the outrages committed there, particularly a letter\r\nfrom his sister Mrs. Grant of Ballindalloch, dated September 5 (App.\r\nNo. 5),[521] He sent about two or three hundred men to Strathaven and\r\nupon their approach Glenbucket retired from that country whereof Mr.\r\nGrant acquainted Sir John Cope, then on his way to Aberdeen by a letter\r\nabout the 10th September (App. No. 6).[522]\r\n\r\nMr. Grant got a Message from Lord President, Sept. 14th, Desiring an\r\nInterview, and as neither of them in the then situation of the Country\r\ncould be absent a night from his own House, Mr. Grant met him Monday\r\n17th at a place apointed, when the Lord President acquainted him, that\r\nhe the Lord President was impowered by the Government to raise some\r\nCompany’s, That therefore he made offer of the first of them to him,\r\nand that he Mr. Grant should have the naming of all the Oficiers of\r\nthat Company. Mr. Grant answered, that since he the Lord President\r\nproposed it, he would take the Company but could not name the Officers\r\ntill he returned home, least by naming some, he might Disoblige others,\r\nbut at the same time, gave his opinion that the raising some Companys\r\nwould not do the service, and that it would be necessary to raise the\r\nwhole of the Clans, that were Friends to the Government.\r\n\r\nUpon Mr. Grants return to his own House, He and all the Gentlemen\r\nin the Country had got Information that the Lord President got the\r\nDisposall of Twenty Companys, he found them greatly Disobliged that\r\nonly one of them was to be given to their Clan, which they thought very\r\nfar short of the proportion they bore to the other Northern Clans,\r\nthat were the avowed and constant Friends of his Majestys Government,\r\nand looked on it as a slight intended to them and that either it was\r\nintended, that no more of them but that company should be employed in\r\nthe service, or if they were that it must be att their own expense\r\nwhile the other Favourite Clanns were to be payed by the Government.\r\nAnd for these Reasons Mr. Grant found greater Difficulty in naming\r\nthe officers than he could foresee before he knew the number of the\r\nCompanys to be raised. That if the measure of raising Companys were\r\nstill insisted on that Mr. Grant rather than hurt the service would\r\naccept of four or even of three of them; But a smaller number would\r\nnot employ the principal Gentlemen of the Clan nor satisfy any of them\r\nwhere so many companys were to be Disposed of.\r\n\r\nLord Deskfoord[523] was therefore prevailed with to go to Culloden to\r\nexplain these things to Lord President and at the same time to assure\r\nhim, that the whole Clan should on all occasions be ready to act in\r\nthe Governments service, only that it would be necessary to give them\r\npay during the Time that they should be employed, because Mr. Grant’s\r\nprivate Fortune could not bear so great an expence.\r\n\r\nLord Deskfoord at his return reported the Lord President’s answer, That\r\nhe was trusted with the Disposal of Twenty Companys, yet at the same\r\ntime all possible economy was enjoined, That he could not therefore at\r\nfirst exceed one Company to any one Clan, That he knew the value and\r\nImportance in that country of the Family of Grant, and had for that\r\nreason offered the first to Mr. Grant, and should he refuse it others\r\nmight follow his Example, and thereby the whole sceme miscarry. And\r\nwhether it was the best measure that might have been proposed yet it\r\nbeing the only one that the Government had yet proposed for employing\r\ntheir friends in the north, a miscarriage might be of bade consequence.\r\nThat he therefore hoped that where so much was at stake Mr. Grant would\r\ncome over small Difficultys, and if in the future Distribution of these\r\nCompanys due regard was not had to the Family of Grant That Mr. Grant\r\nwould have reason to Complain.\r\n\r\nUpon Consideration of this answer Mr. Grant satisfied his Friends,\r\nand with their approbation accepted of the Company offered, whereof\r\nhe acquainted Lord President by his letter September 22d (App. No.\r\n7),[524] and therein named the officers. And Lord President by his\r\nanswer, Sept 24th, (App. No. 8),[525] Confirmed what Lord Deskfoord had\r\nreported of the Communing Between them, Approved the nomination Mr.\r\nGrant had made of Officers, and desired that the men might be ready at\r\na call, because he Daily expected arms and money.\r\n\r\nSeptember 28th Lord President wrote to Mr. Grant, (App. No. 9),[526]\r\nthe Different accounts he had got of the Battle of Preston, and after\r\nExpressing his apprehension of the effects it might have in that\r\ncountry ‘Suggests That Mr. Grant should have all his people Alert that\r\nthey might be able to do such service as the exegence might require,\r\nwhich would help to cause their Neighbours Consider.’\r\n\r\nThis was the first letter that Mr. Grant received from any Person\r\nintrusted by the Government that Directly proposed the raising his Men,\r\nother than the Company already mentioned and having received advices\r\nabout the same time that the Farquharsons in Aberdeenshire were rising,\r\nand that the M‘Phersons were to march through Strathspey to join them,\r\nhe furthwith rised all the men that he could Find any Kind of Arms for,\r\nand got together about seven hundred. The M‘Phersons did accordingly\r\nabout two days after march near the Borders between Badenoch and\r\nStrathspey; but upon Mr. Grants marching up to meet them, they retired\r\nto Ruthven, and from thence to Cluny M‘Phersons house. But Mr. Grant\r\nhaving got Intelligence, that the M‘Intoshes were in Motion, he keeped\r\nhis Men together for eight Days ’till he had certain notice that they\r\nhad not moved.[527]\r\n\r\nMr. Grant had sent him by his Baillie in Urquhart Twelve miles\r\nbenorth Inverness a Letter to the Baillie from Angus M‘Donald son to\r\nGlengarry,[528] Dated September the 30th, ordering the Tenants in that\r\nCountry to Join his Standart (as he called it) and threatening in case\r\nof Disobedience to burn the Country, and was afterwards advised by the\r\nBaillie by a letter of October 8th that he had been prevented by the\r\nsaid Angus M‘Donald from Marching into Strathspey as Mr. Grant had\r\nordered him with such of the Tenants as were willing to follow him, and\r\nthat the Country would be ruined in ten Days. These Letters Mr. Grant\r\nanswered October 6th and 10th, exhorting them to continue stadefast to\r\nthe Government, ordering the Baillie to bring the Men to Strathspey,\r\nand engaging himself to repair all the Damage the Rebells should do\r\nthem if they complyed with his order (App. No. 10, 11, 12, 13).[529]\r\n\r\nMr. Grant received a Letter from Lord Loudoun, October 11th (App.\r\nNo. 14th),[530] acquainting him of his arival to command the Troops\r\nwith one from Lord President, October 12th, Desiring him to bring the\r\nCompany together, and to have them ready to march at a Call, and as\r\nmany men as Mr. Grant could arm to have them ready on any Exigency if\r\nthey were called out and adds ‘Ways and Means shall be fallen on to\r\nsubsist them’ (App. No. 15),[531] and October 16th (App. No. 16),[532]\r\nMr. Grant assures Lord Loudoun that he would exert himself to do\r\neverything in his power for his Majestys service under his Lordships\r\nDirection and Advice, acquaints him of his having sent a party to\r\nBanffshire to stop levying cess for the Pretender (which effectually\r\ndid at that time), and gives him notice that the Company was ready at a\r\nCall.\r\n\r\nOctober 22d and 23d Mr. Grant received from John Grant his Chamberlain\r\nor Steward in Urquhart Two letters, Dated 21st and 22d October (App.\r\nNo. 17 and 18),[533] Aquainting him that Glengarry’s son, M‘Donald of\r\nBarrisdale, Glenmoriston and the Master of Lovat, were come to force\r\nout his Tenents in Urquhart, and threatned to carrie away their whole\r\nCattle, if they did not Join. That upon the Chamberlains assuring them,\r\nthat Mr. Grant would make good all their Damages The Tenants absolutely\r\nrefused to Join and resolved to oppose the M‘Donalds, should they\r\nattempt to carry off their Cattle, tho they were not able to resist\r\nboth them and the Frasers, and aquainting him also of a Dispute between\r\nthe Master of Lovat and Barrisdale which of them had the best title to\r\nthese Tenents. The Master insisting that he had the best right to them\r\nexcept such of them as were of the name of M‘Donald whom he willingly\r\nyielded to Barrisdale, and that this Dispute had superseded the\r\nexecution of their Threatnings Till it should be decided by Lord Lovat.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Grant looked upon this as of the utmost immportance to the\r\nGovernment, that the King’s Faithfull subjects who were Determined even\r\nat the hazard of their lives and the whole of their little Fortunes to\r\npersevere in their Loyalty, should not suffer to be Dragged against\r\ntheir wills into the Rebellion and that too within Twelve miles of\r\nInverness. He was at the same time aware, That Lord Loudoun who\r\nhad then got no more than one of the new Companys the Monroes, not\r\nhaving yet called for the Grants, had not a force sufficient to leave\r\nInverness, and to march against such Numbers as might be brought to\r\noppose him, and as Urquhart is Distant about fourty miles from Castle\r\nGrant, There was no time to Deliberate, or to receive Lord Loudon’s\r\nDirections. Mr. Grant therefore forthwith assembled his friends to\r\nthe number of betwixt six and seven Hundred tho many of them were\r\nill armed, and Marched for Inverness in his way to Urquhart having\r\nRecommended to Lord Deskfoord to give notice of his March and the\r\nDesign of it by Express to the Earl of Loudoun and Lord President, and\r\nto begg that Lord Loudoun would order Quarters to be provided for the\r\nmen at Inverness. But upon Saturday the 26th James Grant of Dell one of\r\nthe Tenants in Urquhart met Mr. Grant upon his march with Accounts that\r\nthe Rebells had Left Urquhart, and marched Northward to the country of\r\nAssint, and Mr. Grant thought himself Lucky that they had done so; for\r\nabout the same Time The answer to Lord Deskfoords Letter signed by both\r\nLord Loudoun and Lord President Dated October 26th (App. No. 19)[534]\r\nwas brought him by Express ‘Wishing that Mr. Grant had Communicated to\r\nthem his Design, before he set out with such numbers, which might have\r\nthe effect to begin Horseplay before they were sufficiently prepared.’\r\nAnd upon Receipt of this Letter Mr. Grant Dismissed his men except\r\nabout 100 that he constantly Keept partly about his House and partly in\r\nsome proper passes or Inlets to his Country.\r\n\r\nNovember 3d Mr. Grant got a Letter from Lord Lewis Gordon in the\r\nPretender’s name (App. No. 20),[535] Desiring Mr. Grants allowance\r\nat least his connivance to raise men. Mr. Grant would not see the\r\nMessenger and ordered such a verbal answer to be given him as his\r\nMessage Deserved, but being at the same Time Informed of Lord Lewis’s\r\npractices in Strathavin and of his Designs on Kincardine,[536] an\r\nEstate upon Speyside belonging to the Duke of Gordon, Mr. Grant\r\nraised about 200 men more and marched them to Abernethy lying betwixt\r\nStrathaven and Kincardine, and thereby not only prevented Lord Lewis\r\nfrom forcing out any men in Kincardine, but also obliged him to retreat\r\nfrom Strathavin, and give over for that time his recruiting there.\r\n\r\nNovember 7th Mr. Grant Received a Letter from Lord Loudoun, Dated Nov.\r\n5 (App. No. 21),[537] commending the Company of Grants that had been\r\nsent to him, and if Mr. Grant should need any assistance against Lord\r\nLewis Gordon, promising all he could give him and at the same time\r\ngot a letter from the President of the same Date, (App. No. 22),[538]\r\nand to the same effect. And in this Letter he for the first time made\r\nan offer to Mr. Grant of another Company and desired him to name the\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nBy this Time the Gentlemen in Strathspey heard it Reported that the\r\nLaird of M‘Leod was to have no less than four companys, and began to\r\ncomplain that Mr. Grant had accepted of even one Company; Therefore\r\ninstead of giving an answer in writing Mr. Grant chose to go to\r\nInverness about November 10th and found that about 400 M‘Leods were\r\nalready come to the neighbourhood of Inverness tho’ it was then said\r\nthat 200 were to be employed and the rest to return Home.\r\n\r\nMr. Grant told Lord Loudoun and Lord President, that all his Friends\r\nwere in perfect good Humour, and readie to venture their Lives and\r\nFortunes in the service, and that it was of the outmost consequence to\r\nhim to preserve that good spirit among them. That he found great Danger\r\nof Creating Jealousys and Animositys among them by raising the first\r\nCompany, tho’ there would have been no Danger nor Difficulty in raising\r\nfour or five. But as the Country was now in Great Ferment the Danger\r\nof Disobligeing many Gentlemen of his name would now be much greater\r\nshould he accept of another Company, and thereby have the naming of\r\nthe officers and no more. However upon their continuing to urge it\r\nMr. Grant agreed to take it to consideration till he should return to\r\nStrathspey, and converse with the Gentlemen of the Country about it.\r\n\r\nAfter Returning to Strathspey the Gentlemen had got certain accounts\r\nthat M‘Leod had got four Companys, besides another to be given to his\r\ncousin M‘Leod of Genzies, and therefore cou’d not be persuaded to agree\r\nto Mr. Grants accepting of only one which they thought a very partial\r\nDistribution, and Mr. Grant by his Letter 29th November, whereof\r\n(_vide_ the Coppy App. No. 23d),[539] aquainting the Lord Loudoun of\r\ntheir Resolutions; ‘but at the same time asured his Lordship that the\r\nwhole body of the clan should be ready upon a few days notice to go\r\nupon any Duty under his Lordships eye or Command, that his Lordship\r\nshould think for his Majesty’s service.’\r\n\r\nIn the same letter Mr. Grant after aquainting Lord Loudoun of the\r\nGreat outrages the Rebells were committing in the shires of Banff\r\nand Aberdeen and noticing of what Importance it would be to relieve\r\nthese Countys, and especially the Town of Aberdeen, from so grievous\r\noppression, beggs to have his Lordships commands and promises in five\r\nDays after Receiving his Lordships Orders to march with five or Six\r\nHundred men to Aberdeen to restore the peace of those parts. Mr. Grant\r\nnow felt the disadvantage of having accepted even of one Company; the\r\nwant of 100 good men and of 100 broadswords and Pistols that he had at\r\nLord Loudouns desire furnished them must have been a considerable loss\r\nin such an Expedition, however he thought himself strong enough without\r\nthem for any body of the Rebells that he heard was in Aberdeenshire\r\nbut as he could not forsee whether they might not be reinforced from\r\nPerth, therefore in that letter he also suggests that in case of any\r\nReinforcements being sent from Perth to Aberdeen, it might be proper to\r\nsend Captain Grants Company to his assistance, and hoped that in his\r\nabsence Lord Loudoun would Protect his Country.\r\n\r\nLord Loudoun however did not think proper to give Mr. Grant these\r\norders (and very likely he Judged better than Mr. Grant) for by his\r\nanswer, December 2d (App. No. 24),[540] he aquaints Mr. Grant of an\r\nExpedition he was going upon, which would take him a few days. After\r\nwhich he proposed to march along the Coast for the Relief of that\r\ncountry, where, if it should prove necessary, he would expect and begg\r\nMr. Grant’s assistance.\r\n\r\nEarl of Findlater and Mr. Grant had repeated advices from Banffshire,\r\nparticularly from the Earl of Findlaters Chamberlain and Mr. Grant of\r\nAuchynanie[541] of the oppressive demands made on the people of that\r\ncountry of men and Money, and Military Execution threatned, in case of\r\nRefusal and that December 10th was fixed for commencing such military\r\nExecution att Keith. Lord Findlater had thereupon, December 9th, wrote\r\nto Lord Loudoun and in his absence to Lord President begging relief and\r\nMr. Grant had given assurance to Auchynanie of Assistance how soon\r\nsuch violences should be begun, and December 11th at night he had a\r\nletter from Auchynanie of that days date, that they were already begun,\r\nand Lord Findater had one from his Chamberlain[542] much to the same\r\npurpose (_vid._ App. No. 25, 26, 27).[543] No Return was come from\r\nLord Loudoun or the President, and there was ground from their former\r\nLetters to presume, that Lord Loudoun was then upon another Expedition,\r\nand immediate relief seemed to be absolutely necessary. Mr. Grant\r\nthought therefore that he might be justly blamed by the Government as\r\nwell as by his Friends in that Country should he stay tamely at home,\r\nwaiting for orders from Lord Loudoun, and suffer them in the meantime\r\nto be ruined. Therefore he brought together 5 or 600 men and with them\r\nmarched, December 12th, from Castle Grant, whereof he then acquainted\r\nLord Loudoun by Express (App. No. 28th),[544] ‘That he proposed to be\r\nnext night at Keith and endeavour to come up with Lord Lewis Gordons\r\nparty, wherever they were, and that he would continue in that country\r\nwith a force sufficient to keep the peace until he should receive his\r\nLordships further Directions.’\r\n\r\nThe weather was so excessive bad and rainy that Mr. Grant by Mid Day\r\nof Saturday, the 14th, had got no further than Auflunkart within four\r\nmiles of Keith, where he got Intelligence that upon notice of his March\r\nthe Rebells had left Keith and gone to Fochabers. Mr. Grant therefore\r\nhalted there that day to refresh his men and clean their arms, and\r\nthere he received a Letter from Lord Findlater of December 13th (App.\r\nNo. 29),[545] covering Lord Presidents answer to his Lordship, Dated\r\nDecember 11th (App. No. 30),[546] which came to Castle Grant only the\r\n13th. In that Letter he Informs Lord Findlater that on the 10th five or\r\nsix hundred men had marched from Inverness towards Aberdeen by Elgin\r\nfor the Relief of these Countys. That they were quickly to be followed\r\nby Lord Loudoun with as many more if needfull, and by a further force\r\nif it shall be wanted.\r\n\r\nAt the same time he had some accounts that Lord Loudoun was come to\r\nMurray, and that the Rebells had brought the boats on Spey to the East\r\nor Fochabers side of the River; Wherefore Mr. Grant sent a party of an\r\nhundred men who secured the boat of Bridge[547] which is two miles\r\nfurther up the River and by Express aquainted Sir Harry Innes[548]\r\nat Elgin of what he had done, and Desired him to ask whether Lord\r\nLoudoun had any Commands for him, and that night he cantoned his men at\r\nAuflunkart Mulbain and adjacent villages.\r\n\r\nNext morning Sir Harrie Innes came to him with a Letter from M‘Leod\r\n(App. No. 31),[549] Expressing ‘his joy at the news of the Grants being\r\nthere, and aquainting him that he was at Elgin to attempt to pass Spey\r\nto assist in Protecting that country. That he heard the passage was\r\nto be Disputed, and that the Rebells had gathered all the boats at\r\nBogg[550] to the East side, and that he was perswaded that Mr. Grants\r\nmoving that way would Disperse them, and open that passage, which\r\notherwise might be hazardous.’ (_Vide_ Mr. Grants answer, App. No.\r\n32.)[551]\r\n\r\nUpon Receipt of this letter Mr. Grant marched towards Fochabers, but\r\nwhen he came within Two Miles of it, accounts were brought him, that on\r\nhis approach the Rebells retired from it through the Enzie. Mr. Grant\r\napprehending that they might have gone to Cullen, and taken Possession\r\nof Lord Findlaters House Detached a Party thither who took possession\r\nof it and the Town and prevented a party of the Rebells that had been\r\nsent thither for that purpose, and sent some gentlemen to wait of\r\nM‘Leod who passed the River without any opposition, and Mr. Grant again\r\nthat night billetted his men, much in the same place they were the\r\nnight before.\r\n\r\nThe Gentlemen sent to M‘Leod Brought Mr. Grant word, that he was to\r\nremain that night at Fochabers, and to march the next day the 16th\r\nto Cullen, wherefore Mr. Grant marched next day to Keith, and after\r\nQuartering his men and placing advance Guards some miles further\r\ntowards Strathboggie, where he heard the main body of the Rebells was,\r\nhe went himself to Cullen to assist the Deputy Sheriffs in accomodating\r\nM‘Leod and his men. For which purpose Mr. Grant had got a Commission of\r\nSheriff Depute from Lord Findlater, and on the 17th returned back to\r\nKeith.\r\n\r\nMr. Grant aquainted M‘Leod of the Letter he had wrote to Lord Loudoun,\r\nand of his purpose to remain at Keith till further orders; but M‘Leod\r\nwas very earnest with him to go forward, and was of opinion that he\r\nwould receive orders to do so.\r\n\r\nUpon Mr. Grants Return to Keith a Messenger brought him a Letter from\r\nLord Lewis Gordon with a printed Declaration by Lord John Drummond\r\nand a printed Letter signed Marshall (App. No. 33).[552] These papers\r\njoined with what M‘Leod had said Determined Mr. Grant to go at\r\nleast to Strathboggie, and therefore returned a verbal answer by the\r\nMessenger who brought the Letter, ‘That if Lord Lewis with his men\r\nwould be at Strathbogie, next Day at 12 o’clock Mr. Grant and his men\r\nshould there give them the answer, which he was Determined should\r\nbe proclaimed over the Cross and affixed upon it.’ He immediately\r\naquainted M‘Leod by Express of his Design and that night got his\r\nanswer (App. No. 34),[553] with a letter from Captain Monro of\r\nCulcairne from Fochabers.\r\n\r\nDecember 18th Mr. Grant marched to Strathboggie and upon his approach\r\nthe Rebells fled, and there he made the Proclamation (App. No. 35)[554]\r\nand affixed it upon the most publick places and provided quarters for\r\nthe Two Companys that Culcairn was bringing, fully Determined if he\r\nwas not countermanded to proceed forward in Aberdeenshire as far as\r\nhe could do any service to the Government, or give any assistance to\r\nM‘Leod, when on the 19th he received a letter from Lord Loudoun and\r\nanother from Lord Deskfoord, both dated at Inverness December 14th\r\n(App. No. 36, 37),[555][556] which pretty plainly apeared to Mr. Grant\r\nto be a Rebuke tho’ in very modest and polite terms for his undertaking\r\nthat Expedition without orders and that Lord Loudoun, as he thought\r\nhe had provided sufficiently for that service without Mr. Grant, he\r\nwished him rather to return than to proceed further, tho’ he wou’d give\r\nhim no orders because he had given him none to go there. He therefore\r\nResolved to return to Keith of which he aquainted Culcairne then at\r\nStrathboggie, as he did also M‘Leod by express, _vid._ his Letter with\r\nM‘Leods answer--(App. No. 38, 39).[557][558]\r\n\r\nMr. Grant therefore Immediately returned to Strathspey but that as he\r\napprehended that when M‘Leod was gone forward some small partys of\r\nthe Rebells (whereof he had heard of severalls that could be formed\r\nin one Days time) might give Disturbance to the Country, he ventured\r\neven without orders to leave a party of 60 men at his house in Mulbain\r\nwithin Two miles of Fochabers, of which however he acquainted Lord\r\nLoudoun after his return to Castle Grant by a Letter, December 24th\r\n(App. No. 40),[559] wherein he renewed his offer of Employing his whole\r\nClan, wherever Lord Loudoun should think they could be of any service\r\nto the Government, and that small party happened afterwards to be of\r\ngood use after the Unlucky Disaster that happened to M‘Leods party at\r\nInverury by securing the boats upon Spey to make good their Retreat.\r\nDecember 25th Mr. Grant received a letter from Sir Harrie Innes dated\r\n24th December (App. No. 41),[560] with an Account of the Disaster at\r\nInverury,[561] and that M‘Leod was come to Elgin and by his orders\r\nDesiring Mr. Grant to have his men ready to oppose Lord Lewis Gordon,\r\nand at least to secure the boats upon Spey, and Sir Harry presses\r\nMr. Grant to march his men the length of Rothes to the Protection\r\nof Murray, and December 29th he received Two letters one from the\r\nMagistrates of Elgin and another from Sir Harrie Innes, Dated December\r\n28th, aquainting him that M‘Leod had marched to Forres and that by\r\ntheir Intelligence they Expected Lord Lewis Gordon with 500 men, and\r\ntherefore begging Mr. Grant to come to protect them. Mr. Grant so far\r\ncomply’d as to secure the Boats; but after the two reproofs he already\r\ngot he did not think that he could be Justified if he should march his\r\nmen a third time, without orders from Lord Loudoun, who surely could\r\nbest judge when it was proper to employ his men. Therefore he wrote to\r\nthe Magistrates his opinion, that Lord Lewis would not venture to Cross\r\nSpey while Lord Loudoun was so near him and he Mr. Grant above him, but\r\nthat he could not promise to march any body of men but in concert with\r\nand by the Direction of Lord Loudoun (App. 42),[562] and he could not\r\nhelp being pleased that he had given such an answer when afterwards he\r\nReceived another letter from Sir Harry Innes wrote that same night,\r\nDecember 28th (App. No. 43),[563] and Lord Loudouns Letter, December\r\n30th (App. No. 44),[564] in answer to Mr. Grants to him of the 24,\r\nwherein he writes Mr. Grant, that he could not yet undertake any new\r\noperation; But that how soon he should find it proper to undertake any\r\nthing of moment towards the East, he should aquaint Mr. Grant in order\r\nto Concert together the most effectual way of Doing it.\r\n\r\nJanuary 9th, 1746, Mr. Grant wrote to my Lord Loudoun by James Grant\r\nhis Chamberlain of Strathspey (App. No. 45),[565] concerning some new\r\nattempts that were made to force his Tenents of Urquhart into the\r\nRebellion. The reason of sending his Chamberlain was that he might\r\nexplain to my Lord the particulars and receive his Lordships orders\r\nwhich he was directed to obey, and in that Letter after giving him some\r\nfurther Intelligence Mr. Grant writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n‘I think it my Duty to take nottice to your Lordship that the Rebells\r\nare exerting themselves in every corner of the North to encrease their\r\narmy. I therefore think it absolutely necessary that all the Friends\r\nof the Government should use their utmost efforts to Disconcert and\r\nDisperse them. I had a meeting yesterday with all the Gentlemen of this\r\nCountry and I can assure your Lordship we wait only your Lordships\r\norder and Directions, and there is nothing in our power but we will do\r\nupon this Important occasion for the service of our King and Country. I\r\nwish it were possible to Assist us with some arms; and money to be sure\r\nwould be also necessary; But give me leave to assure your Lordship,\r\nthat the last Farthing I or any of my Friends have, or that our credit\r\ncan procure us, shall be employed in supporting of our men upon any\r\nexpedition your Lordship shall Direct us to undertake for this glorious\r\nCause we are all Ingaged in. I wish to God your Lordship and the Lord\r\nPresident would think of some measure of conveening the whole body of\r\nthe Kings Friends in the North, and I would gladely hope we would form\r\nsuch a body as would in a Great Measure disconcert, and strike a Damp\r\nupon the army of the Rebells in the South and effectually put a stop\r\nto any further Junctions they may Expect benorth Stirling. And at the\r\nsame time surely we might prevent their being Masters of so much of\r\nthis North Coast as also hinder many of the Kings Subjects from being\r\nopprest by the exorbitant sums of Money the Rebells are at present\r\nLevying.’\r\n\r\nJanuary 17th Mr. Grant received Lord Loudouns Answer, Dated Jany 16\r\n(App. No. 46),[566] approving indeed Mr. Grants sceme, but that he\r\ncould not in the present Situation undertake it, till he had got a\r\nreturn to Letters he had sent for Instructions, and a little more\r\ncertainty of the motions of the Rebells, and that how soon Instructions\r\nshould arive, he should aquaint Mr. Grant and consult with him.\r\n\r\nAfter this nothing Material happened in the North till the Retreat of\r\nthe Rebells from Stirling and upon the first Intelligence of their\r\ncoming to Blair[567] Mr. Grant again conveened his men to the number\r\nof above Six Hundred tho’ very ill armed whom he stationed in the\r\nproperest manner he could either for Joining Lord Loudon (who he\r\nsupposed would probably come to his assistance) to attack the Rebells\r\nat the passes in the entrance into the Country, or if Lord Loudoun\r\nshould not come to his Assistance, and that the Rebells should be too\r\nnumerous for him to engage alone, so as to retire but keep in a body\r\nand prevent as far as possible their Destroying the Country or forcing\r\naway any of his men.\r\n\r\nAbout February 8th Mr. Grant received a letter from Lord Loudoun,\r\ndated 7th (App. No. 47),[568] with what accounts he had of the Rebells\r\nmotions, and of their Designs on that Country, which he did not seem\r\nto think they would soon attempt, and recommends to Mr. Grant first to\r\nemploy people to get Intelligence, ‘And in the next place I hope you\r\nwill have your people alert that we may Act by Concert and support one\r\nanother which I asure you I will to the outmost.’\r\n\r\nMr. Grant obeyed both these Orders with all the Exactness that he\r\nwas Capable of. Sunday, 19th February, he sent by his Chamberlain of\r\nStrathspey the Intelligence (App. No. 48),[569] wherein he begged\r\nsome arms if any could be spared, and Tuesday, February 11th, sent\r\ntwo Expresses with Intelligence (_vide_ App. No. 49),[570] that the\r\nRebells were come the length of Ruthven.\r\n\r\nFebruary 12th Mr. Grant received Letters from Lord Loudoun and the\r\nPresident of the 11th with accounts that the arms were landed, That Mr.\r\nGrants Clan was well armed, yet in the Distribution Lord Loudoun would\r\nreserve as many as he could for him.\r\n\r\nThey seemed to think Mr. Grant in no Danger of being Disturbed by the\r\nRebells, and mention their Readiness to receive the Rebells and support\r\nMr. Grant (App. No. 50, 51).[571]\r\n\r\nFebruary 13th, Mr. Grant sent Lord Loudoun further Intelligence of\r\nthe Rebells Motions and numbers, beggs to have if possible 400 guns,\r\nfor that his people were extremely ill armed, tho’ to Deceive the\r\nRebells he behoved to give out the contrary. And the 14th he sent more\r\nIntelligence to the Governor of Fort George to be communicated to\r\nLord Loudoun and still Demanding Arms (App. No. 52),[572] and still\r\nfurther on the 15th (App. No. 53),[573] when the Rebells were come\r\ninto Strath Spey, the length of Avymore, and were that night to be at\r\nInverlaidnan.[574] Lord Loudouns Letter of February 15th (App. No.\r\n54),[575] which was the last he had from him while att Inverness came\r\nto hand Monday, 16th, telling that if the Rebells should come he hoped\r\nto give them a Warm Reception. That as he was threatened with being\r\nattacked he could not spare a party to carry arms to Mr. Grant, but\r\nthat if Mr. Grant would send Down 300 men he would provide them as well\r\nas he could.\r\n\r\nAfter the 15th Mr. Grant durst not send any Letters to Lord Loudoun,\r\nbut both the 16th and Munday the 17th (the Day that Inverness was\r\ntaken)[576] he sent two Expresses each day with accounts of the Rebells\r\nmotions. And even after Lord Loudoun was gone to Ross, Mr. Grant found\r\nmeans of conveying to him an account of His Royal Highness the Duke\r\nmarching Northward from Perth, and by the same Conveyance got a Return\r\nsigned by Lord Loudoun and the President, which he transmitted to Sir\r\nEverard Falconer.[577]\r\n\r\nMr. Grant was made to believe that his Royall Highness was Immediately\r\nfollowing in Pursuit of the Highlanders, and therefore kept his men\r\ntogether in order to join the army till Sunday 23rd February that he\r\nreceived a letter from Mr. Murray, secretary to the Pretender (which\r\nat present is fallen by hand), Reproaching him for assisting the\r\nGovernment, and for the further offers of assistance made by his Father\r\nSir James Grant which the Rebells had Discovered by Letters sent Mr.\r\nGrant by Express by Lord Justice Clerk whom they had Intercepted, and\r\ntherefore ordering him Betwixt a Day limited to send to Inverness all\r\nthe arms in the Country with hostages who were named in the Letter for\r\nthe peaceable Behaviour of the Clan.\r\n\r\nMr. Grant at this time had Intelligence, that the Macphersons, some\r\nof the Athol men and the Menzies were in a body in Badenoch above him\r\nthat Glenbucket with about 300 men were in Strathaven and Glenlivet and\r\nthat another party was Marching by Murray to enter Strathspey by the\r\nLower end of it; He was Informed that the Duke was still at Perth. He\r\nwas not an equal Match for all these partys alone, and could not hope\r\nfor assistance from any Quarter. Therefore he had no Choice but that\r\nof either being Besieged in his own House or making good his retreat\r\nto the army. The House could not hold out long, and therefore the\r\nother was resolved on, and he chose rather to force his way against\r\nGlenbucket, than to venture by Ruthven where the M‘Donalds by Joining\r\nthe M‘Phersons had it in their power to intercept them.\r\n\r\nMonday 24th Feby. Lord Findlater and Mr. Grant and their Ladys set out\r\nfor Strathaven escorted by between 5 and 600 men, and the Better to\r\nencourage them to leave their Houses, he proposed to give them his Bond\r\nto repair all the Dammage that the Rebells should do them; But the men\r\nsaid that they relied upon his word without any Bond.\r\n\r\nUpon Mr. Grants marching his men Glenbucket retired from Strathaven\r\ninto the low Country, and at Strathaven an Express sent by Lord Justice\r\nClark (but who had been taken prisoner by Glenbucket and set at liberty\r\non his retiring) came to him and brought him the news that the Duke\r\nwas come to Aberdeen.[578] Mr. Grant thereupon directed his course\r\nthither, and when he came to Newe, three miles from the house of Forbes\r\nof Skellater one of the Rebells, finding himself out of Danger of any\r\nGreat body of Rebells sent home his men to take care of their Cattle\r\nand houses, taking with him only 150 for an escort to Aberdeen, and\r\nordered that all the men in the Country should be ready on the first\r\ncall to come to Join him.\r\n\r\nThese 150 Mr. Grant marched to Kintore and left them there and March\r\n1st went himself to attend His Royall Highness to Aberdeen; and\r\nremained there till the 9th that he was ordered to Inverury, where\r\nhis men then were, and from thence to proceed slowly to Strathspey,\r\nso as to serve as an advanced Guard to the Troops in their march to\r\nStrathbogg, and in that March before he reached Castle Forbes[579]\r\nhad the Disagreeable news of a Ridiculous and Scandalous Treaty\r\nof Neutrality (as it was called) that five Gentlemen of his name\r\nhad signed to the Rebells which he transmitted to Aberdeen to be\r\ncommunicated to his Royall Highness. As this was done in his Absence\r\nand was in his opinion the greatest affront that could have been done\r\nhim, none living can look upon it with Greater Indignation than he\r\ndoes, notwithstanding of what all these gentlemen say to alleviate\r\nit, which is, That finding their country threatened to be Burnt,\r\nand no appearance of Immediate Relief, They consulted together on\r\nthe properest measure to Divert their Ruin, and it was agreed on as\r\nthe most prudent measure to endeavour to gain Time by treating with\r\nthe Rebells untill the Army would come up, and for that end to send\r\nthree of them as Deputys for the Rest, that when these three came to\r\nInverness they were forthwith made prisoners and keept there upon their\r\nparoles, and the Rebells insisted that other two gentlemen should\r\nlikewise come before concluding any Treaty. That by these means they\r\ngot the matter Delayed for some Days, and when at last a written paper\r\nwas presented to them to sign promising upon their Honours that neither\r\nthey nor their Dependents should bear arms against them, They all\r\nabsolutely refused to sign it, until they were Threatened to be thrown\r\ninto Dungeons, and Lord George Murray with a party of Two Thousand men\r\nand some Cannon ordered to Strathspey to burn and Destroy the Country\r\nand then they signed it, believing that in the Strictest Honour, they\r\ncould not be Bound to perform a promise Extorted from them in such\r\ncircumstances. That it was Twelve days after their first confinement\r\nbefore this parole was signed and some time Before the dukes passing\r\nSpey.[580] Three of the five were allowed to return home, and how\r\nsoon Mr. Grant got home to Castle Grant, which was before the Battle\r\nof Culloden, These three joined him and were very active in bringing\r\ntogether the men.\r\n\r\nThis is a plain and genuine narrative of Mr. Grants conduct from the\r\nbeginning of the late wicked Rebellion until he went to Aberdeen. The\r\npart he acted afterwards is already sufficiently known to His Royall\r\nHighness the Duke, and Mr. Grant wants not any other Justification,\r\nwhereas the former part being acted in a corner of the Highlands could\r\nnot be so generally Known.\r\n\r\nThe naked Facts are stated without any observations upon them, which\r\nwill naturally enough arise to any Person into whose hands this may\r\ncome. And no Facts are stated but such as are either sufficiently\r\nproved by the writings in the Appendix or can be proved beyond\r\nContradiction and no part of another persons conduct mentioned except\r\nin so far as it was necessarly Connected with his.\r\n\r\nAnd it is hoped it does appear that nothing was ommitted on Mr. Grants\r\npart that he could Devise for supporting the Government or Distressing\r\nthe Rebells. He did not indeed know what were Lord Loudouns or Lord\r\nPresidents Instructions or powers, nor was it fit that he should know\r\nthem; But by that means perhaps it was that sometimes he undertook\r\nExpeditions and projected scemes that these Gentlemen possibly, yea\r\nprobably, for good Reasons Judged not to be expedient or seasonable,\r\nbut however that may be an argument of his want of skill, or of his too\r\ngreat forwardness, but surely it can be none of his want of Zeal to his\r\nMost Gracious Sovereign and our present Happy Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF THE REV. JOHN GRANT, MINISTER OF URQUHART; AND OF ALEXANDER\r\nGRANT OF SHEUGLY IN URQUHART, AND JAMES GRANT, HIS SON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINFORMATION for MR. JOHN GRANT, Minister of the Gospel at URQUHART\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hear that Mr. John Grant is charged w^{th} reading and explaining\r\nto his Congregation and Parishioners in Irish the Pretenders Manifesto\r\nfrom the Pulpit and in other places. This is as false as the Charge\r\nis Malicious. I thank God for it I was never reckoned a Bedlamite or\r\na madman, and truly if this Charge were well founded I think that all\r\nthe Punishment that the Law can conflict [_sic_] is but to little. How\r\nsoon ever I had certain information that the Pretenders son was landed\r\nI wrote a letter to Lochaber to Mr. John Stewart for intelligence as\r\nit was reported the Rebel Army was to besiege Fortaugustus[581] and\r\nInverness. This I did in presence of the Laird of Grants Baillie. I\r\ngave a Copy of the return to my letter to the Baillie that he might let\r\nthe Governor of Inverness and the Laird of Grant see it. The Baillie\r\ntold me that the Governor own’d that piece of Intelligence to be of\r\nvast consequence to the North and that the Laird of Grant was likewise\r\ninformed of it--the letter inform’d that they were to march directly\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nIn Nov^r when the M‘Donalds and Frasers came to the country in order\r\nto raise the men I preach’d publickly ag^{st} it and exhorted my\r\ncongregation to live peaceably.\r\n\r\nThis rais’d the Wrath of most of my Parishioners who were in the\r\nRebellion ag^{st} me insomuch that I was daily insulted even by the\r\nmeanest of the Parish particularly towards the close of Dec^r last I\r\nwas after sermon attacted by above 20 men and threatned to be drowned\r\nin a Loch near by for my praying for his Majesty King George. I and\r\nsome other gentlemen went to a woman in Distress. Immediately there\r\ncame into the House 2 fellows with drawn durks to kill me and were\r\nit not for some Gentlemen then present I wou’d have suffered for the\r\nstroak that was leveld at me cutt an Iron Crook. I was the object of\r\nthe M‘Donald’s hatred because of my attachment to the present happy\r\nEstablishment, in so much that in Feb^y last when the M‘Donalds to the\r\nnumber of 400 or 500 men came to the Country my house was attacked by 8\r\nor 9 of them; they first rapp’d at the doors and windows and then they\r\nwere to set fire to the house were it not that the Gentlemen with whom\r\nthey lodged and whose house was close by mine hindered it for fear of\r\nhis own house.\r\n\r\nMy wife spoke to them next day they swore that they wou’d knock me\r\ndown with butts of their Guns because they’d scorn to give me a\r\nbetter death. My wife was so frighten’d that she sicken’d abhorted\r\nand was verie like to have lost her life being confined for 6 weeks\r\nto her Bed. I was then obliged to give up preaching. After I was for\r\n2 Sabbaths without preaching my Parishioners cry’d out ag^{st} me for\r\ntheir wanting of sermon, then I ventured to preach and prayed for his\r\nMajesty King George. But the second Sunday I preached I was mobb’d\r\nin the Churchyard and had my Cloaths torn. A fellow who was for some\r\ntime my officer and whom I turn’d off for his having gone to the North\r\nafter the Rebels proclaimed publickly in the Churchyard that I should\r\nno more pray for King George and that I should have no stipend pay’d\r\nme this year, which last hold but to true for I did not receive 40s.\r\nof the last years stipends as yet. I was then a 2^d time obliged to\r\ngive up preaching as I had not the Protection of the Law. The Sunday\r\nimmediately before the Battle of Culloden I was attacted by 4 of the\r\nRebels and very rudely dealt by for my Praying for King George and for\r\nhaving given up preaching they swore that if I would not preach next\r\nSunday and pray for the Pretenders son whom they call’d Prince Charles,\r\nThey or some of their Corps would attend and shoot me thro’ the head.\r\nBut blessed be God their power was soon broken and I then preach’d\r\nand pray’d w^{th}out distraction or fear. Towards the beginning of May\r\nwhen Mr. Grant of Grant had with his men left the country of Urquhart\r\nand gone to Inverness with the People of Glenmoriston and Urquhart\r\nwho had surrendered Mr. John Grant was surpris’d to hear of Alex^r\r\nGrant of Sheugly and his son’s confinement at Inverness. Mr. Grant\r\nof Grant wrote to his Bailie to acquaint me to repair to Inverness\r\nwithout loss of time as he had particular business with me in relation\r\nto the surrenderers in the Parish of Urquhart. Accordingly I went to\r\nInverness without delay and waited of Mr. Grant, was by him keept for 6\r\nor 7 days living still in the Town on my own Charges without any other\r\nbusiness but giving the Characters of the Men who had surrendered in\r\nUrquhart. Mr. Grant likewise challeng’d me for asserting Alex^r Grant\r\nof Sheugly and his son as peaceable subjects and told me that he would\r\nput me on my marrow bones for that sometime. After I answer’d Mr.\r\nGrant that I attested nothing but what I was conscious was truth; this\r\nConference happen’d in Mr. Grant of Grant’s room on the 9^{th} of May.\r\nSunday thereafter, being the 11^{th} of May, Mr. Grant of Grant sent\r\na Gentleman of his name to my Quarters desiring that I shou’d repair\r\nto his Room immediately. I was not within in the meantime but how\r\nsoon I got notice of it I immediately went to Grants Lodgings where I\r\nwas made prisoner. I was surprised at this as I suffered in my Person\r\nand Means for my attachment to the Government. But upon Reflection my\r\nsurprise soon evanish’d. I have been minister at Urquhart for near 6\r\nyears without legal Gleib, Manse or any of those advantages which the\r\nLaw allows. I several times apply’d to Mr. Grant of Grant as Patron\r\nand principal Heritor in the Parish for redress either by giving me a\r\npiece of Land which my Predecessors allways had in farm by the Lairds\r\nof Grant or then by consenting to my having Legal Gleib and Manse as\r\nthe Law directs I was put off with fair promises but no performance.\r\nI could not live with any comfort as I was situated, Mr. Grant having\r\nsettled a Brother-in-Law of his Bailie’s in the Kitching w^{ch}\r\nmy Predecessors had and all the other houses of the Town excepting\r\none brocken house. This neighbour I got was Bankrupt and his wife\r\na notorious scold. Last year I wrote to Mr. Grant to grant me my\r\nconveniences for my own money otherwise to excuse me to ask for them\r\nin a legal manner. When Mr. Grant received this letter he rampaged,\r\nburnt my Letter, and swore revenge ag^{st} me; besides there is near\r\ntwo years stipends due me out of Mr. Grant’s Estate in Urquhart w^{ch}\r\nw^{th} some mony he has of my Fathers per Bond and to w^{ch} I am\r\nexpressly provided in the Bond makes a pretty good sum and as Mr. Grant\r\nlikes money very well this is a verie easie Method of paying his debt\r\nand being revenged of me at the same time. As the above are all matters\r\nof fact I know no other reason for my suffering and confinement to the\r\npresent Royal Family or that I might be of use to the Government in\r\nsomething which might be very disagreeable both to Mr. Grant and his\r\nBailie.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) JOHN GRANTT.\r\n\r\n_Castle Street, Sixth July 1746._\r\n\r\n\r\nMINUTE of the PRESBYTERY of ABERTARFF\r\n\r\n    _At Fort Augustus, 13th June 1746._\r\n\r\nThe Presbytry of Abertarph being met and Constitute It was represented\r\nthat the Rev^d Mr. John Grant, minister of the Gospel at Urquhart, and\r\nmember of this Judicatory, had been sometime ago laid under arrest on\r\nsuspicion of being disaffected to the present happy establishment, and\r\nthe Presbytery being deeply affected to think that any of their number\r\nshould give the least umbrage to any mortal on that important subject\r\ntook Mr. Grant’s past conduct with regard to Government under their\r\nmost serious deliberation, and upon the whole find Cause to certify\r\nthat (abstracting from the present Charge brought against him, to which\r\nthey are entire Strangers, having no immediate Access to enquire into\r\nit by reason of the great disturbances here) he still behav’d himself\r\namong them as became a minister of the Gospel, discovering upon every\r\noccasion his Inviolable Attachment and Loyalty to his Majesty’s person\r\nand Government. Given in name presence and at appointment of Presbytry,\r\ndate and place forsaid by\r\n\r\n    THOM. FRAZER, Mod^r.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINUTE of the PRESBYTERY of ABERNETHY\r\n\r\n    _At Abernethy the 5th Day of July 1746._\r\n\r\nThe Presbytery of Abernethy, taking to their Consideration That the\r\nReverend Mr. John Grant minister of the Gospel at Urquhart had been\r\ntaken up and shipped off for London upon a Suspicion of treasonable\r\npractices during this wicked and unnaturall rebellion, Could not but\r\nin Justice to Mr. Grant’s Character Certifie of him as follows. First,\r\nThat he was born in the Bounds of this Presbytery of Honest parents\r\nwho professed the Protestant Religion according to the Principles\r\nof the Established Church of Scotland and he had his Education in\r\nthis way. 2^{dly} That as Mr. Grant very early in his younger years\r\nthought of applying himself to the Work of the Ministry he attended\r\nthe Colleges of Philosophy and Divinity and brought from the several\r\nProfessors sufficient Testimonials of his diligence and progress in his\r\nstudies as well as of his morall Character so that this Presbytery had\r\nEncouragement to enter him upon Trials and upon finding him qualified\r\nDid Licence him to preach of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 3^{dly} That,\r\nafter he was licenced he continued in the Bounds of this Presbytery for\r\nthe space of some years and both in his publick Discourses and private\r\nConversation discovered the firmest attachment to His Majesty King\r\nGeorge his Person and Government. And had the same Principles and views\r\nwith respect to Government that all the Members of this Judicatory\r\nhave particularly That the Security of our Religion and Liberty is\r\ninseperably connected with the stability of our Most Gracious Sovereign\r\nKing George his Throne and the Succession of his Royall Line. And since\r\nMr. Grant removed from our Bounds and was ordained Minister at Urquhart\r\nin the neighbouring Presbytery of Abertarph, which will be about\r\nsix years agoe he has continued in the strictest friendship and most\r\nintimate Correspondence with the most of our Members and still they\r\nfound that neither his Principles nor practices were anyways Derogatory\r\nfrom what he had early imbibed, publickly owned, and all along\r\npractised while among them. And from the Report of some of our Members\r\nwho have been in the Parish of Urquhart since Mr. Grant was carryed of\r\nIt is notour and well known there that several Attacks were made on Mr.\r\nGrants Life during the Rebellion for his Attachment to the Government\r\nand his continuing in his duty to pray for His Majesty King George and\r\nthe Royall Family.\r\n\r\nAt one time a Man who had the Rank of an Officer in the Rebellious\r\nMob threatned on a Sabbath Day immediately after Divine Worship to\r\nseize him, carry him to a Loch in the neighbourhood, and Drown him\r\nthere, and gott about thirty or fourty of the same Gang to Join in\r\nthe Undertaking. At anoy^r time two Ruffians broke into a Company\r\nwhere Mr. Grant was, attacked him with drawn Durks untill hindered by\r\nthose who were present. Again on a Sabbath day immediatly as he came\r\nout from Sermon some of the Rebells Wives and others fell upon him,\r\ntore his Cloaths and abused him so that with great Difficulty he was\r\nrescued from them and gott into his own house. Another party of the\r\nsame wicked Crew threatned publickly to burn his House and Family,\r\nwhen they got their opportunity. Therefore from our Knowledge of Mr.\r\nGrant’s Principles, our through Acquaintance of him, together with the\r\nNotouriety of thes facts with respect to his Usage by the Rebells,\r\nwe cannot but hope that he is entirely innocent of any charge of\r\nDissloyalty can be brought agst. him, and we are apt to presume that\r\nsome invidious person or persons have given in an Information against\r\nhim which tho’ false in fact may either kill him by Confinement as he\r\nis of a tender Constitution or ruin his circumstances by the Expense of\r\nsuch a Process, by either of q^{ch} they will sufficientlie gratifie\r\ny^r malicious views. And we are fully satisfied that if there is the\r\nleast of misconduct chargeable on Mr. Grant it must have been entirely\r\nowing to Inadvertency and oversight and not the effect of Principle or\r\nDesign. Given Day and Date above in name in presence and by appointment\r\nof the Presbytery of Abernethy, and signed by\r\n\r\n    PAT GRANT, Mod^r.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe EXAMINATION of JOHN GRANT, minister of URQUHART near Inverness\r\n\r\n    Westminster to Wit.\r\n\r\nBeing asked where he was at the time that the Rebellion first of\r\nall broke out, he saith, that he was at his own Parish at Urquhart\r\naforesaid, where he continued from the Beginning to the end of the said\r\nRebellion without stirring from thence to the distance of 10 miles.\r\nBeing asked whether or no the Laird of Grant ever made him, the Exam^t,\r\nprivy to any Intention which he the Lord of Grant had of raising his\r\nmen for the Service of the Government, or ever sent for him to any\r\nconsultation about what measures were proper to be taken by the Grants\r\nupon occasion of the Rebellion, he saith, that he was not either privy\r\nto the Intentions of the said Laird of Grant, or was he ever sent for\r\nto any place by the said Laird of Grant to give his advice or opinion\r\nwhat was proper to be done about raising the Grants: He Saith, he\r\nremembers that upon the breaking out of the Rebellion the Laird of\r\nGrants Baillie who was at Urqhart where the Exam^t also was told the\r\nExam^t privately that the Laird of Grant was not determined, and would\r\nnot determine what to do, till he saw how matters were likely to turn\r\nout or that effect and whoever should first attack his, the Laird of\r\nGrants country whether but in general it was     [_sic_]\r\n\r\n[_sic_]     Rebels or the Kings Forces He the Laird of Grant w^d raise\r\nhis men against them.\r\n\r\nwas told to the People of Urqhart that it was the said Laird’s desire\r\nthat the People should live peaceably. This was upon the first\r\nappearance of the Rebellion when the Gentlemen in the Grant’s country\r\nsent to the Laird of Grant to desire his assistance and advice, as they\r\nwere threatned with Fire and Sword by Lochiel, unless they would rise\r\nand join the Pretender’s Son, and he saith that the Baillie aforesaid\r\ntold the Exam^t sometime afterwards privately the Laird would not be\r\naverse to some part of his Clan’s joining the Pretenders son Privately\r\nin order to save the Country. Being asked whether he was one of those\r\nwho opposed the Laird of Grant’s accepting the Company which was\r\nfirst offer’d by the Lord President to the said Laird for raising the\r\nGrants for the Government, he saith he was not, nor was he privy to or\r\nadvised with concerning the said company. He saith, that sometime in\r\nNovember last a Party of the MacDonalds and Fraziers came to Urqhart\r\nunder the command of M‘Donald of Barrisdale and the Master of Lovat,\r\nthe whole amounting to about 4 or 500 men: that M‘Donald and the Master\r\nof Lovat lodged at the Exam^{ts} house two or three Days at that time,\r\nand the reason of which was, that the Exam^{ts} wife was related to\r\nthe Master of Lovat’s Family: that the Master of Lovat and another\r\nperson of the name of Frazer applied to the Exam^t to be Chaplain to\r\nthem, and promised to give him six and eight pence a day, if he would\r\nconsent thereto, to which the Exam^t answer’d, that if they would go to\r\nInverness to serve his Majesty King George, he would be their chaplain\r\nwith all his heart for one third of the money that he reproached them\r\nfor having taken up arms for a Popish Pretender, and shew’d them the\r\nconsequences of such Behaviour. That the Master of Lovat said, he was\r\nacted upon, and as he was engaged so far, must go on still further:\r\nThat, whether they applied to him to be chaplain in Joke or Earnest, he\r\ncannot say, tho’ he is well satisfied that they both knew the Exam^t\r\nto be in a very different way of thinking from them: that, neither of\r\nthem used the Exam^t ill, or insulted him upon account of his being\r\nsteady to the Government: but that some of their men quarrelled with\r\nthe Exam^t on account of his having preached against the Rebellion, and\r\ndissuaded them from it in the strongest terms he could use, and on\r\naccount of his having prayed publickly in the Church for His Majesty,\r\nand told the Exam^t that it became him not to preach and pray in that\r\nmanner. He saith, that during the time the said Party was at Urquhart,\r\nhe made it his Business to declaim against the Rebellion, and whenever\r\nhe heard of any People who had an Intention to join the Rebels, he\r\nwent to them and used the most prevailing arguments he could to turn\r\nthem from their Design: that MacDonald and the Master of Lovat having\r\nsoon found that the Exam^t was determined not to engage with them,\r\ndid not open themselves to him about their Intentions at all: that he\r\nseveral times was in Danger of his Life from MacDonalds upon account of\r\nthe aversion he constantly express’d upon all occasions in public and\r\nprivate against their undertakings.\r\n\r\nHe saith, that after the said Party of the Macdonalds and Fraziers had\r\nquitted Urquhart, other Partys of the Rebels were continually passing\r\nand repassing thro’ the said County: that the Exam^t persevered in his\r\nEndeavours to dissuade them from their engagements, and was very often\r\nin Danger of his Life upon that account; that about the latter end of\r\nthe Month of February last the General Rendezvous of the Rebel army was\r\nabout a mile from his house, that there was a general cry thro’ all the\r\nsaid Army that the Exam^t was not to be tolerated in the daring manner\r\nin which he acted for the Government: that he received several notices\r\nthat his House should be plunder’d and burnt unless he desisted:\r\nthat his Life was also several times threatned; that the Highlanders\r\npublickly declared that he deserved no other kind of Death than to be\r\nbeaten in Pieces with the Butt Ends of their Guns: and upon the 21^{st}\r\nand 22^d of February he expected nothing but Death from them.\r\n\r\nBeing asked, whether he received or conveyed any Letters to or from\r\nany Persons concerned in the Rebellion to or from any People concerned\r\nin the same, he saith, he never was directly or indirectly concerned\r\nin any thing of that sort, nor was he ever directly or indirectly the\r\nInstrument of receiving or conveying any verbal messages to or from\r\nany of the Persons concerned in the said Rebellion to or from their\r\naccomplices.\r\n\r\nBeing asked, whether he ever willingly gave any Harbour or Protection\r\nor assistance of any kind whatever to the Rebels; he saith, he never\r\ndid, on the contrary he saith, that he took all the methods he could\r\nto prevent their receiving any Party where had or could exert his\r\nInfluence.\r\n\r\nBeing asked whether he was Privy to the Neutrality which was signed by\r\nsome of the Grants for the Rest whilst the Duke was at Aberdeen, he\r\nsaith, that he was not Privy to it in any shape nor any ways assisting\r\nor advising in it.\r\n\r\nBeing asked whether if the Laird of Grant had exerted himself to the\r\nutmost for the Government he might not have been of great service to\r\nit, He saith, that his opinion is that if the Laird of Grant had been\r\nso disposed he might have been of great service.\r\n\r\nHe saith, that he was informed by the Factor of the Earl of Stair, that\r\nGlenmorrison told him, the said Factor, that he Glenmorrison went out\r\nto assist the Pretender’s son with a Party of the Grants by the Laird\r\nof Grant’s advice.\r\n\r\nHe saith, that with relation to the 84 Grants, who surrendered at\r\nInverness, they were indeed engaged to surrender before the Exam^t saw\r\nthem, but he strengthened and confirmed them in their Resolution.\r\n\r\nHe saith, that he never assisted the Rebels in any shape whatever;\r\nnever was privy to any of their Schemes or Plots: never served them\r\nin any manner; but on the contrary opposed them, preached against the\r\nRebellion constantly, and constantly prayed for King George, to the\r\ndaily hazard of his life for several months: that he was so well known\r\nand remarked for opposing them to the utmost, that he was the object\r\nof their Hatred, and that it is next to a miracle that he was not\r\nsacrificed to their Resentment.\r\n\r\n    JOHN GRANTT.\r\n\r\n    _Whitehall, 14 Aug. 1746._\r\n    Taken before me, THOS. WAITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFORMATION for ALEXANDER GRANT of SHEUGLY and JAMES GRANT his son\r\n\r\nAs to the Case of Mr. Grant of Shewgly, It’s informed That he is\r\nimpeached with a Correspondence w^{th} the Pretenders Son. This is\r\nabsolutely false in itself, as he never corresponded with him in word\r\nor write in his life, but upon the Pretenders son arrival in Arisake\r\nhow soon he set up his Fathers Standart that he wrote circular letters\r\nto all the countrys in the Highlands desiring to assist and join him\r\nwith all the men they could agains a preceese day, among which there\r\nwas a letter sent to the Country of Urquhart directed for the s^d\r\nAlex^r Grant and the rest of the Gentlemen of Urquhart with one other\r\nto the Laird of Grant himself. The very next morning after receiving\r\nthe letter they chapterly conveened in order to consider of the proper\r\nuse to be made therof, and what was thought upon was: immediately to\r\nsend that Letter with the other letter to Mr. Grant younger of Grant\r\nby the Baillie of Urquhart to make the legal use thereof as he thought\r\nproper; All this accordingly was done with that very breath and the\r\nBaillie went accordingly. This letter was keeped by Mr. Grant till such\r\ntime as the said Alex Grant was made prisoner at Inverness and then\r\ngave it to the Duke of Cumberlands Secretary.\r\n\r\nAs also its informed that the said Alex Grant was assisting in sending\r\nmen from the Country of Urquhart to join the Rebels. This is also false\r\nand injurious as it can be made plainly appear, that the s^d Alex^r\r\nGrant at three several times did turn back some of the Gentlemen of the\r\nCountry w^{th} a considerable body of men who marched bag and baggage\r\nunder full arms six miles from their habitation, and that by the s^d\r\nAlex Grants persuasion, tho the Country was very oft harased and\r\nthreatened w^{th} destruction, prevailed withal to stay at home till\r\nsome time in February last that a Regiment of the Macdonalds came to\r\nthe Country to force the men, or otherways under-go utter destruction\r\nby burning the country and destroying their heal effects, which to\r\nprevent the most of the Gentlemen with three or four score men went\r\nalongs, and with all the persuasion in the said Alex Grants power could\r\nnot get them prevailed upon to stay.\r\n\r\nAnd further to testifie the s^d Alex^r Grant his sincere endeavours\r\nto assist the Government. Mr. Grant younger of Grant w^{th} five or\r\nsix hundred of his men having come to the Country of Urquhart some\r\ntime after the Battle of Culloden, in order to get the Grants of\r\nGlenmoriston and Urquhart to surrender, Mr. Grant did put upon him the\r\nsaid Alex. Grant in the strongest manner to concur and assist to get\r\nhis purpose effectual, which the s^d Alex Grant accordingly went about\r\nand with a great deal of labour and fatigue both night and day got them\r\nat last convinced, and with great difficulty prevailed with them to\r\nsurrender, providing they could be made sure of their lives, which Mr.\r\nGrant not only engaged by Vow and Oath but by a very binding Letter\r\nunder his hands to Grant of Daldeagan, which letter is still extant to\r\nproduce in the Duke of Cumberland’s hands. This seems no less than a\r\nparadox in itself considering that Mr. Grant gave out to the Duke of\r\nCumberland that he and his men apprehended them in Rocks and Woods. The\r\nnext day after their meeting the said Alex Grant with 84 men of the\r\nGrants of Glenmoriston and Urquhart came near Mr. Grants lodging there\r\nand surrendered prisoners upon terms and gave up their arms before\r\nSir Alexander Macdonald and several other Gentlemen, and the next day\r\nthereafter Mr. Grant with his men marched directly to Inverness with\r\nthe surrender. But the said Alex Grant, being in a bad state of health\r\nafter the fatigue and strugle he had in this interpose, came to take\r\nleave of his young Chief and return home, but Mr. Grant told him that\r\nhe would not part with him till he had got the Duke of Cumberland to\r\nthank him for his services, and that it was otherways necessary his\r\ngoing to Inverness, to give a character of the Men for their more\r\nspeedy Relief, which accordingly he comply’d w^{th}, and less than\r\nan hour after their arrival at Inverness Mr. Grant sent for him to\r\nhis own Lodging upon pretence of material business relating to this\r\naffair, and within two minutes after coming to him the said Mr. Lewis\r\nGrant told him that he was sorry to understand that he the said Alex\r\nGrant was to be made prisoner, which immediately was done and carried\r\nto the Comon Guard, Mr. Grant giving him the strongest assurance that\r\nhe would be released the next morning. Its to be observed that if the\r\nsaid surrenders had been dismissed at Inverness according to Mr. Grants\r\npromise the whole Rebells then in arms in the Highlands of Scotland had\r\nsurrendered in less than ten days, the Grants being the very first that\r\ndid surrender.\r\n\r\nAs to James Grant his case what is laid to his Charge is still a\r\nmistery so that no particular answer can be made to it, but it can be\r\nalways made appear that since the beginning of the Rebellion he stayed\r\npeaceably at home and after several attempts made upon him defied the\r\nRebells request to move him any manner of way, and still continued so\r\ntill Mr. Grant younger of Grant after the Battle of Culloden brought\r\nhis Militia to Inverness, and having sent for a number of men to\r\nUrquhart to join him, the s^d James Grant with sixty men directly\r\nmarch’d to Inverness, joined Mr. Grant and the rest of his men there,\r\nwith whom he continued a Captain till such time as Mr. Grant returned\r\nfrom Urquhart to Inverness w^{th} the surrenderers. The said James\r\nGrant was very assistful with his father to get the said number of men\r\nto surrender, w^{ch} Mr. Grant had never done but by their persuasion,\r\nimmediately as they arrived at Inverness Mr. Grant employed the s^d\r\nJames Grant to make out a list of the number of men under his command\r\nin order to provide them Quarters, this being done was sent for, to\r\ncome to his Lodgings, where he remained till his father came up, and\r\nwith the same breath Mr. Grant told him he was to be made prisoner but\r\nnot to be afraid, that tomorrow he would see him relieved, and so forth\r\nwas carried with his father prisoner to the Comon Guard but never heard\r\na word from Mr. Grant till this moment.\r\n\r\nThe said Alex Grant is informed that the said Mr. Lewis Grant has given\r\nas an article of accusasion ag^{st} him that some of his children\r\nhad been sent by him the said Alex Grant to join and carry arms for\r\nthe Pretender. The said Alex Grant owns so much of this Charge, that\r\ncontrary to his inclination and frequent instruction his said Children\r\n(who were not staying with him) some of them did join the Rebell armie\r\nand the said Alex Grant offers to make it appear by Gentlemen of\r\nundoubted credit and firm attachment to the Government that he used\r\nall the interest he was master of both as a parent and a friend to the\r\npresent Government to keep his children at home, and that from the time\r\nhis children who so engaged had taken such resolution none of them\r\ndurst ever appear in his presence. It is submitted whether or not the\r\nsaid Alex Grant could have done more to keep his children at home.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) ALEXANDER GRANTT.\r\n             JAMES GRANTT.\r\n\r\n_Castle Street, Sixth July 1746._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe EXAMINATION of JAMES GRANT of SHEUGLY, Esq.[582]\r\n\r\n    Westminster to Wit.\r\n    _14th Aug. 1746._\r\n\r\nBeing asked where he was when the Rebellion in Scotland first broke\r\nout, he saith, that he was in his own County in the parish of Urquhart,\r\nwhere he continued from the beginning to the end of the Rebellion\r\nwithout going to any Place of any Distance from the said Parish of\r\nUrquhart. Being asked whether he was one of the Gentlemen consulted by\r\nthe Laird of Grant upon the occasion of the Lord President’s offering\r\na company to the said Laird for raising men for the Government which\r\nGentlemen refused to accept of the said one Company, he saith he was\r\nnot, nor was he ever advised with or consulted thereupon: Nor did the\r\nLaird of Grant ever send to the Examinant or to his Father, who is\r\nlately dead, to come to him in order to advise and consult with them\r\nupon the measures to be taken upon that occasion: he saith, that the\r\nLaird of Grant’s Bailly upon the Rebellion first breaking out told the\r\nGrants publickly, that it was the Lairds desire that they should remain\r\npeaceable and quiet, but the said Bailie told this Exam^t and his\r\nfather and two other Gentlemen of the name of Grant privately that it\r\nwas the said Lairds desire that a Company of the Grants should join the\r\nPretender’s son privately in order to protect the Country. He saith,\r\nthat he was never sent for during the Rebellion by the said Laird of\r\nGrant upon any occasion to be advised with, or consulted with about it:\r\nthat in the Progress of the Rebellion, several different parties of the\r\nRebels came into that part of the Country, where the Exam^t was, and\r\npressed him to take on with them, but that he constantly refused them,\r\nand would not have anything to do with them.\r\n\r\nHe saith, that he never was directly nor indirectly concerned in\r\nreceiving or conveying of any letters or verbal messages to or from any\r\nPersons in the Rebellion to any persons whatever, nor did he willingly\r\nharbour, protect, or supply in any shape any of the aforesaid Persons,\r\nnor was he ever made privy to any designs or Intentions of the said\r\nRebels.\r\n\r\nHe saith, that different Partys of the Rebels who passed thro’ the\r\nCountry having threatened to use violence to some of the Grants unless\r\nthey would join them, a Party of them with a Gentleman at their Head,\r\nwent to Castle Grant to take the Directions of the Laird, and offer’d\r\nto go and join Lord Loudoun or any one else, if he would give them\r\norders in writing for so doing: that the Laird of Grant told them, they\r\nmight go and join the Devil if they would, and imprisoned the Gentleman\r\nwho came along with them for two or three days for his officiousness.\r\n\r\nHe saith, that he made it his Business whenever he had an opportunity,\r\nto dissuade those whom he could come at from engaging in the Rebellion,\r\nand exerted his utmost endeavours to convince them of the rashness of\r\ntheir undertaking.\r\n\r\nBeing asked whether he was privy to the Neutrality signed by some\r\nGentlemen amongst the Grants, whilst the Rebels were at Aberdeen, He\r\nsaith, he was not privy to it in any shape, nor doth he know who were\r\nthe conductors of that Neutrality.\r\n\r\nAfter the Battle of Culloden some of the Grants remaining in arms for\r\nthe Pretender’s Son the Exam^t and his Father were sent to by the\r\nLaird of Grant (who had never sent to the Exam^t or his Father during\r\nthe Rebellion before) to go to the said People and persuade them to\r\nsurrender: He saith, that he and his Father accordingly went to the\r\nsaid men, and with the assistance of the Rev^d Mr. John Grant prevailed\r\nwith them to surrender, and marched with them for that purpose to\r\nInverness, where to his great surprise the Exam^t, His Father, and the\r\nsaid Rev^d Mr. Grant were made Prisoners with the aforesaid Rebels, and\r\nsent up hither for he does not know what.\r\n\r\nHe saith, that he verily believes that the ill-usage his Father met\r\nwith, served in a great degree to shorten his father’s life. He saith,\r\nthat all his and his Father’s Cattle were taken from them for some time\r\nfor not joining the Rebels: that he never held any correspondences with\r\nthe Rebels in any shape, nor ever was instrumental in serving them at\r\nall, and that if he behaved civilly to them whilst they remained in the\r\nCountry where the Exam^t was it was out of Fear and not the effect of\r\nInclination.\r\n\r\nBeing asked whether it be his opinion that if the Laird of Grant had\r\nwrote to the People in the Country to rise for the Government the said\r\nPeople would have taken up arms for the Government, he saith, that he\r\nverily believes if the laird of Grant had done so, the Country would\r\nhave joined the Kings Troops, and done all the service in their Power,\r\nbut this was neglected by the said Laird of Grant till the Battle\r\nof Culloden was over, when the Exam^t joined the said Laird at his\r\nrequest with 50 or 60 men, being all who were capable of bearing arms\r\nin the Country, and that being the first and only Request which the\r\nLaird of Grant ever made to the Exam^t upon occasion of the Rebellion.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) JAMES GRANTT.\r\n\r\n    _Whitehall, August 14, 1746._\r\n    Taken before me,       THOS.

He was pleased to attend us and laid several matters of\r\na Treasonable nature to their Charge. But as all those matters came to\r\nthe knowledge of Mr. Ludovick Grant by Information from others only;\r\nand none of them fell within his own personal knowledge, and as it is\r\na considerable time since the Prisoners have applied to be discharged;\r\nand no Information has yet been given against either of them upon oath;\r\nand neither Mr. Sharpe,[586] of whom we have inquired, nor Mr. Ludovick\r\nGrant know of any witnesses now here who can charge them upon oath; and\r\nthe Prisoners are not yet committed either for Treason or suspition\r\nof Treason, and most of the things objected to them are only triable\r\nin Scotland. We beg leave humbly to submit it as our Opinion, that it\r\nmay be advisable to admit them to Bail for their Appearance, before\r\nthe Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh, at the first sitting of the said\r\nCourt, after the first of December next, there to answer such things\r\nas may be then laid to their charge; when there Will be an opportunity\r\nof Committing and trying them in case evidence shall appear sufficient\r\nfor that purpose. We proposed to Mr. Ludovick Grant, the only person\r\nwho has appeared before us as their Accuser that they should be Bailed\r\nfor their appearance at Edinburgh, and he has told us that he has no\r\nobjection to it but thought it might be proper.\r\n\r\nAll which is most humbly submitted to your Grace’s Consideration.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) D.

and as several of the\r\nServices therein set forth were performed, by verbal as well as by\r\nwritten Orders he had the honour to receive from His Royal Highness the\r\nDuke while in Scotland, it was by his Royal Highness’s Directions that\r\nthe said Account was above three years ago laid before your Lordships\r\nby S^r Everard Fawkener, and that the Report relating thereto is now\r\nsigned by him.\r\n\r\nThat your Memorialist has not in that or any other Account charged\r\nanything for his Trouble or Loss of Time for upwards of four years,\r\nhe has been employed in the Service of the Government as aforesaid\r\nand finding out and collecting the Evidences for the Crown against\r\nthe Rebells assisting in carrying on the Prosecutions against them at\r\nLondon, York, and Carlisle, attending the Tryal of Provost Stuart at\r\nEdinburgh, finding Bills in Scotland against those who were excepted\r\nout of the Act of Indemnity and other Services.\r\n\r\nThat before the Rebellion your Memorialist as an officer of the\r\nRevenue rendered greater service thereto than ever was done by any\r\nofficer thereof in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThat your Memorialists share of the Profits arising from the\r\nCondemnation of prohibited and uncustomed Goods seized by him the three\r\nyears immediately preceding the Rebellion amounted to above £4000 and\r\nthe Crowns to above double that sum; that the remarkable Part reacted\r\nfor the Service of the Government, from the first Breaking out of the\r\nRebellion, made the Rebells lay hold upon everything that belonged to\r\nhim and amongst other Things upon the greatest part of the Goods so\r\ncondemned as aforesaid, and by which he was (exclusive of his other\r\nlosses by the Rebellion) a most considerable sufferer.\r\n\r\nThat more Goods have been run in Scotland since the Rebellion than ever\r\nwas done before in that Country in the same space of time.\r\n\r\nThat your Memorialist had several Informations relating thereto, but\r\ncould not Profit thereby, by reason of the manner in which he has these\r\nfour years past been employed, in the more Important Services to the\r\nGovernment before mentioned.\r\n\r\nThat few would have undertaken these services by reason of the apparent\r\nHazard and other fatal Consequences, with which they were likely to be\r\nattended, and which he has in many Instances felt.\r\n\r\nThat your Memorialists wife who died of the Cruel usage she met with\r\nfrom the Rebells, certfy’d as above, has left him four Children to\r\nprovide for.\r\n\r\nThat your Memorialists younger brother Captain Grosset who was\r\nbarbarously murdered by the Rebells,[588] and whose remarkable services\r\nduring the Rebellion are well known to all the Generals who commanded\r\nin Scotland, as well as to his Royal Highness the Duke, has left a\r\nwidow and five children to whose support your Memorialist is obliged to\r\ncontribute.\r\n\r\nThat the Insults and insufferable ill usage which they as well as his\r\nown Children daily met with in Scotland, has obliged him to bring them\r\nall to England, and who are thereby in effect banished their Country\r\nfor their Father’s faithful Services to the Government.\r\n\r\nThat the Expenses your Memorialist has been and is thereby put to, and\r\nby false and scandalous Libells and groundless and vexatious Lawsuits,\r\non account of the Services before mentioned, not only far exceeds the\r\none half of the Profits of the Commission in which he is joined with\r\nSir John Shaw[589] (and which is the only mark of favour he has met\r\nwith for his services, losses, and sufferings as aforesaid) but of his\r\nestate which is considerably lessened thereby and his other Losses by\r\nthe Rebellion.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole if your Memorialist is turned out of the Employment\r\nabove mentioned, before he is other wise suitably provided for, it\r\nwill in place of rewarding the important services certified as above,\r\nbe punishing him in the severest manner Especially as by the wording\r\nof the Warrant by which he is to be turned out of that Commission (if\r\nthat Warrant is allowed to take place) your Memorialist must unjustly\r\nbe recorded as one unworthy to be continued in that Employment, which\r\nis doing all that can be done to ruin him and his Family, and must\r\nbe attended with worse consequences to them, than if the Rebells had\r\nsucceeded in the many attempts they made to deprive him of his Life, as\r\nthey did in taking away his Brothers; or if he had suffered along with\r\nthe Rebell Peers and others, who could not have been condemned if it\r\nhad not been for the Evidences he procured against them; Many of whose\r\nfamilies and even those who were most active in the Rebellion, enjoy\r\nat this Time more of their Estates and Fortunes than he does of his,\r\nin proportion to the respective amounts thereof, before the Rebellion,\r\nand are themselves caressed and esteemed, whilst your Memorialist and\r\nhis Family, and that of his unfortunate Brother, are daily harassed,\r\naffronted and cruelly persecuted by the Influence of that Party without\r\nbeing Protected, supported, or properly Countenanced by that Government\r\nto whom we rendered so many real services, and on which account we are\r\nso great sufferers.\r\n\r\nAll which is humbly submitted, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n    [Endorsed.--Mr. Grossetts Memorial relating to the Report of S^r\r\n    Everard Fawkener and Mr. Sharpe upon the account of his Services\r\n    to the Government.]\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--In the Record Office there are two documents, one\r\n    entitled, ‘A NARRATIVE of Sundry Services performed by Walter\r\n    Grossett, Esqr., during the course of the Rebellion, etc.’ which\r\n    is countersigned as true by the Earl of Home and Generals Hawley,\r\n    Handasyde, Guest, and Cope.

As the Rebells at Alloa could have\r\n    no Intelligence of their Designs, the Passage\r\n    across the Forth, being for some time before\r\n    this stopt everywhere, and as the Wind when they\r\n    sailed proved favourable they thought themselves\r\n    sure of surprizing the Rebells that Night at\r\n    Alloa. But as by the time they had got one third\r\n    of the way thither, the Wind turned flat against\r\n    them it was one o’clock next Day before they\r\n    got to Hegins Nook three Miles below Alloa and\r\n    where they were  stopt from proceeding farther\r\n    by the Ebbing of the Tide. Upon their Arrival\r\n    there Mr. Grosett having received Intelligence\r\n    from Alloa that the Rebells were shipping their\r\n    cannon on Board of a Vessell, with a Design to\r\n    proceed in the Night, and to land them on the\r\n    opposite side of the River about two Miles above\r\n    that Place so soon as the Tide would admitt of\r\n    the Vessell’s floating and Sailing from that\r\n    Harbour; and as Mr. Grosett was perfectly well\r\n    acquainted with the River and every Corner of\r\n    the Country, to prevent this, Fifty Soldiers\r\n    and as many armed Sailors were put on board\r\n    one large and two smaller Boats with orders\r\n    to pass privately in the Night to the Rebells\r\n    Batteries at Elphinstone and Alloa and lye at a\r\n    Place appointed about a mile above Alloa, where\r\n    the Vessell with the Cannon was to pass, and\r\n    where they could not be observed, either from\r\n    Alloa, or even from the Vessells on Board of\r\n    which they had shipped their Cannon ’till they\r\n    were just upon them, by reason of the windings\r\n    and Turnings of that River and as Mr. Grosett\r\n    had procured proper Pilots for that purpose,\r\n    they got to the Place appointed, without being\r\n    observed either from Elphingstone or from Alloa;\r\n    and as the same Flood Tide and Depth of Water,\r\n    that would have carry’d the Vessell with the\r\n    Cannon from Alloa could have carried the Sloops\r\n    of War there, they could not in this situation\r\n    have failed, in securing the Vessell and Cannon:\r\n    But the Commander of the largest Boat,  being\r\n    seized with an unreasonable Pannick, could\r\n    not be prevailed with to stay at the place\r\n    appointed tho’ there was much less Danger in\r\n    remaining there than in returning: For as in\r\n    their Return they alarmed the Rebells at Alloa\r\n    by one of the Boats taking the Ground near that\r\n    Place, they had a continued Fire to get thro’\r\n    as they past Alloa and Elphingstone Batteries;\r\n    But Mr. Grosett having by order of Lord Justice\r\n    Clarke taken 200 Matts of Flax from on Board\r\n    a Dutch ship in the Road of Leith,[612] and\r\n    placed these along the sides of the Boats there\r\n    was only one man killed and another wounded on\r\n    this Expedition, and which answered the end so\r\n    far as to keep the Vessell from Sailing, and\r\n    the Rebells from getting their Cannon at this\r\n    time across the River, as they had projected;\r\n    Mr. Grosett receiving at this Juncture\r\n    Information from Alloa that the Rebells there\r\n    were not even at this time above 200 strong:\r\n    they upon the Return of the Boats landed the\r\n    Troops at Kincairdin about three miles below\r\n    Alloa, with a Design to attack them by Land.\r\n    But Mr. Grosett being soon after acquainted\r\n    by different Expresses from Alloa that the\r\n    Rebells had just received a Reinforcement of\r\n    300 men they returned and reimbarked the Troops\r\n    without any Loss. That Day the Vessell with\r\n    the Cannon sailed from Alloa; But Mr. Grosett\r\n    having fallen upon a method to get one of the\r\n    Sailors who knew the River, and whom they had\r\n    forced out to assist in the conducting of this\r\n     Vessell persuaded to run her on Ground on\r\n    some of the Banks in her Passage up the River;\r\n    Upon receiving Information that the Vessell was\r\n    accordingly grounded, and that the Rebells had\r\n    thereupon dismounted their Battery at Alloa,\r\n    and were transporting all the Cannon they had\r\n    there by Land two miles above Alloa in order to\r\n    cross them there. It was thereupon resolved to\r\n    attack their Battery at Elphingstone, and after\r\n    silencing the Cannon there to proceed with small\r\n    Vessells and Boats, and set Fire to the Vessell\r\n    that lay a Ground, with the Cannon and other\r\n    Military Stores: The Battery at Elphingstone was\r\n    accordingly attacked with great Resolution and\r\n    Bravery by the Captains of the _Vulture_ and\r\n    _Pearl_ Sloops of War, assisted by the _Pretty\r\n    Janet_ armed Vessell and _Jean_ armed sloop:\r\n    And after about three hours close cannonading\r\n    within less than Musquet Shot of the Battery,\r\n    all their Cannon but one were silenced: But the\r\n    _Pearl_ having her cable cut asunder by a Cannon\r\n    ball, she was forced from her Station by the\r\n    strength of the Ebb-Tide, and the Two Pilots\r\n    of the _Vulture_ (one of them a Shipmaster at\r\n    Elphinstone who at Mr Grosett’s Request came\r\n    to his assistance in this Expedition) having\r\n    each of them at this Time Lost a leg by another\r\n    Cannon ball, and by which Accident they both\r\n    Dyed; They were obliged to quit the Battery;\r\n    This attack however so far answered the End\r\n    as to prevent the Rebells from crossing with\r\n    their Cannon; For upon making this  Attack\r\n    they brought back their Cannon to Alloa, and\r\n    placed them upon the Battery, there to prevent\r\n    the Kings Ships and Troops from procedeing\r\n    farther up the River, and getting Possession of\r\n    the Vessell that lay aground above that Place\r\n    with the Cannon and Ammunition. In this whole\r\n    affair Two men were killed, Two lost a leg each\r\n    by which they died and one an Arm by the Cannon\r\n    from the Batteries, Ten others were wounded, but\r\n    not disabled; the Chief Engineer and several\r\n    others of the Rebells were killed and many\r\n    wounded. Mr. Grosett having on the 11th January\r\n    received a letter from Lord Justice Clarke with\r\n    an Order inclosed from General Hawley to Colonel\r\n    Layton to return with the Troops to join the\r\n    Army who were then ready to march to the Relief\r\n    of Sterling Castle, they thereupon returned\r\n    accordingly; But Mr. Grosett having before he\r\n    left that country concerted Measures for getting\r\n    the Vessell burnt that was grounded as above in\r\n    which the Cannon had been transported from Alloa\r\n    it was done accordingly without the Rebells\r\n    knowing how it came about.\r\n\r\n    Lord Justice Clarke in his letter, dated the\r\n    10th Janry. 1745/6,[613] having sent Mr.\r\n    Grosett a Letter from General Hawley to General\r\n    Blackeney[614] who at that time commanded\r\n    in the Castle of Sterling with Directions to\r\n    use all methods possible to get it delivered\r\n    and answered, as on it depended Matters of the\r\n    greatest Consequence; Mr. Grosett not only got\r\n    the Letter safely delivered, but an answer\r\n    thereto, tho’ the Rebells were at that time in\r\n    Possession of Sterling and suffered none they\r\n    could observe to go near the Castle and upon\r\n    which they kept the strictest Guard.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: No. 18]\r\n\r\n    Expended in all these Services, for Provisions,\r\n    Intelligence, Boats, Pilots, etc.               39  4  0\r\n\r\n    Upon the 12th January 1745/6 Mr. Grosett\r\n    returned to Edinburgh from this Expedition, and\r\n    upon the 13th was sent early next morning by\r\n    Lord Justice Clarke to procure Intelligence of\r\n    the motions of the Rebells for General Husk, who\r\n    was that Day to march with the First Division\r\n    of the Army from Edinburgh for Linlithgow;[615]\r\n    Upon Mr. Grosett’s coming near that place,\r\n    being informed by some Country People he had\r\n    sent into the Town, for Intelligence that\r\n    about Twelve hundred of the Rebells had that\r\n    Morning taken Possession thereof and given\r\n    out that they were resolved to dispute their\r\n    Quarters with the Kings Troops.

SIRS,--In Obedience to your directions of the 8^{th}\r\n    Instant Inclosing an Order and Warrand from Lord Justice Clerk\r\n    and General Guest Commander in chief of the Forces in Scotland,\r\n    for bringing over all Ships, Vessells and Boats, lying in any of\r\n    the Harbours or Creeks, betwixt Stirling and S: Andrews on the\r\n    North side of the Firth, to the Harbours therein specified on\r\n    the south side thereof, and for Burning or destroying the ships\r\n    and Vessells etc., of such of the Proprieters thereof as should\r\n    refuse to comply with these Orders; I have with the assistance of\r\n    the Kings Boats at Queensferry and Borristounness, and two Boats\r\n    Crews belonging to the Happy Janet stationed off Queensferry,\r\n    removed, disabled, or destroyed, all Boats and Vessells that\r\n    lay betwixt Stirling and Aberdour. But as the doing of this,\r\n    would not have hinder the Rebell Army from geting a Cross the\r\n    River, while Boats and Vessells were allowed to remain at the\r\n    severall Creeks in Carron Water, and at Hargens Nuik Airth, and\r\n    Elphingstone, and other Creeks on the south side of the Forth\r\n    betwixt Borristounness and Stirling; I therefore proceeded to\r\n    these places, and prevailed with severall of the Proprieters of\r\n    Boats and Vessells there, to remove them from thence, but as some\r\n    of them refused to comply, by reason of their not being included\r\n    in the Order and Warrand above mentioned, I am therefore Humbly\r\n    of Opinion, that Lord Justice Clerk and General Guest should\r\n    be applyed to, for a Warrand for the removing or destroying of\r\n    them. And as there are at this time at Alloa, a considerable\r\n    quantity of Deals and Learge Loggs of Wood, of 30 or 40 feet in\r\n    Length, of which Floots may not only easely be made, for the\r\n    Transporting of Men, Horses etc.; from the one side of the River\r\n    to the other, but upon which Flooting Batteries may be reased,\r\n    to move from place to place, to play upon such of His Majesties\r\n    Forces or others, who may be employed in Defending the Banks of\r\n    the River, to prevent the Landing of the Rebells. It is therefore\r\n    Humbly submitted, how far it may be thought proper at this\r\n    Juncture, to have these Deals and Loggs removed from Alloa. If\r\n    this is approven off, what I would propose as the easiest method\r\n    of removing them, would be to put them on Board of Vessells, to\r\n    ly at Borristounness till the danger is over. With this view I\r\n    spook to several shipmasters of my acquaintance, (who I knew to\r\n    be good Whiggs and well wishers to the common Cause) on Tuesday\r\n    last at Borristounness, and who at my request, readily agreed to\r\n    take them on Board their Vessells, upon their only being paid\r\n    the Charges they should be put to in going to Alloa to Load and\r\n    unload them.

Guest, to get the\r\n    Troops transported in the most Expeditious manner from Stirling,\r\n    and the Cannon from on Board the Ships at Borrowstonness to\r\n    Edinburgh, for the defence thereof, the Rebells being at this\r\n    time within a days march of that Town and by which means they\r\n    were prevented from getting again possession of that important\r\n    place.\r\n\r\n    That he on Several occasions provided Vessells, rais’d the well\r\n    Affected Country people, embarked Souldiers, and conducted\r\n    Several Expeditions upon the Forth, to surprize the Rebells\r\n    and retard their intended Siege of Stirling Castle, in which\r\n    he succeeded; as also in destroying by the Dukes Command, the\r\n    Magazines belonging to the Rebells on the North side of the Forth\r\n    and who on that occasion took several of the Rebells prisoners\r\n    and sent them to his R.H. then at Stirling.\r\n\r\n    That he procured several Boats and Vessells to attend ye Army\r\n    with provisions and other necessary’s as it march’d along the\r\n    Coaste, to attack the Rebells at Culloden (where his younger\r\n    Brother Captain Grosett was barbarously murdered) he also\r\n    procured Pilotts to go with Commodore Smith to the Orkneys to\r\n    prevent the Rebells there joining these at Culloden, and assisted\r\n    Lord Justice Clerk in procuring whatever was found necessary for\r\n    the Army, and for the Service of the Governmt. at the Critical\r\n    Juncture.\r\n\r\n    That Mr. Grosett was appointed by His Grace the Duke of Newcastle\r\n    to transact the Affairs of the Government in Scotland relating to\r\n    the Rebellion, and to find out and collect the Evidence against\r\n    the Rebells, and to keep a constant Corespondence with His Grace\r\n    and Mr. Sharpe in all such matters as might require it, with\r\n    assurance that the expense thereof, and of the Witnesses sent up\r\n    to Town shd. be defrayed, and that care would be taken of his\r\n    having a Suitable Satisfaction for his trouble.\r\n\r\n    That it appears to us from the Certificate of the Lord Justice\r\n    Clerk, that Mr. Grosett being employed on behalf of the Governt.\r\n    from the first breaking out of the Rebelling, and his Acting in\r\n    so open and remarkable a manner in the Service of the Government,\r\n    created against him the particular ill will of the Jacobites\r\n    and their adherents, who on that Acct. took every opertunity of\r\n    shewing their resentment against him, they Plundered his House\r\n    in Town and in the Country, and carried of Effects to a very\r\n    great Value, they drove all the Cattle from of his Estate, forced\r\n    the payment of the Rents thereof to them, Stript his Wife and\r\n    Children of the very Cloaths they had on, and used them otherwise\r\n    in a moste inhumain manner.\r\n\r\n    That as to the Several Sums charged for Expenses in those\r\n    Services, Mr. Grosett has not in any of his accompts charged\r\n    anything for the Extraordinary trouble and fatigue he underwent,\r\n    but only for the sums he actually expended, and tho’ he has\r\n    advanced above £5000 in these Services he has not charged the\r\n    Governmt. anything on the Head of Interest.\r\n\r\n    Upon the whole it appears to us, that during the late unfortunate\r\n    rebellion, Mr. Grosett was employed in several services of the\r\n    greatest trust and confidence, and which required great prudence,\r\n    resolution and activity in the execution of them, and that he\r\n    executed the same, with great care, exactness and ability and\r\n    that he continued his services to the government after the\r\n    suppression of the rebellion with equal ardour, zeal, activity\r\n    and dilligence, and in the whole of his behaviour, he appeared\r\n    to us to be actuated as much by his affection to the government\r\n    as the duties of his office, and with regard to the articles of\r\n    his accounts which remain unpaid and which amount to the sum of\r\n    3709£ 11s. we apprehend them reasonable, and therefore certify\r\n    your Lordships that the said sum of 3709£ 11s. appears to us to\r\n    be justified, due to him for the sums expended by him in the\r\n    services aforesaid.\r\n\r\n    (_Signed_) Everard Fawkener.\r\n             John Sharpe.\r\n\r\n    _6th February 1749._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE BATTLES OF PRESTON, FALKIRK, AND CULLODEN; BY\r\nANDREW LUMISDEN, THEN PRIVATE SECRETARY TO PRINCE CHARLES; BY A\r\nGENTLEMAN WHO WAS IN THESE ACTIONS\r\n\r\nOF THE BATTLE OF PRESTON, OR GLADESMUIR,\r\n\r\nFOUGHT SEPTEMBER 21^st, 1745\r\n\r\n\r\nIntelligence having been brought to the Prince, that Lieutenant General\r\nCope, commander in chief of the government forces in Scotland, was\r\nlanded at Dunbar, with the troops he embarked at Aberdeen, and was\r\njoined by Hamilton and Gardiner’s dragoons, he resolved to march\r\ndirectly and attack him.\r\n\r\nAccordingly on the 20th September, in the morning, the Prince put\r\nhimself at the head of the army at Dudingston, and presenting his sword\r\nsaid--‘My friends I have flung away the scabbard.’ This was answered by\r\na chearful huzza.\r\n\r\nThe army marched till they gained the top of Carberryhill, from whence\r\nwe observed the enemy drawn up on the plain below, in order of battle.\r\nWe continued the march along the brow of the hill, till we were\r\nopposite to the front of, and at half a miles distance from the enemy.\r\nHere the Highlanders gave a shout, by way of defiance, and nothing less\r\nthan authority could restrain them from coming immediately to action.\r\n\r\nSeveral officers were sent, particularly Colonel Ker of Gradane, to\r\nreconnoitre the enemy’s camp. They reported that General Cope had got\r\ninto a fastness, where it was impossible to attack him, without risking\r\nthe loss of the whole army: That his right was drawn up to the high\r\nwalls of the gardens of Preston, where he had made several breaches to\r\nretire into, if needful: The house of Seton and a small morass on the\r\nleft: An inclosure not half a gun shot over, surrounded with a ditch\r\nthree or four feet deep, and five or six broad, covered his front;\r\nwhich made two ditches of that breadth and depth to pass: And the sea\r\nwas in his rear, at no great distance from him: His canons and coehorns\r\nwere planted on a high way that led to Tranent, between the above\r\ninclosure and morass. Thus his front was to the south, his rear to the\r\nnorth, his right to the west, and his left to the east.\r\n\r\nIn this situation what was to be done? It was about two o’clock in the\r\nafter-noon. The Prince made several movements to amuse the enemy, and\r\nplaced guards on the several roads that led to their camp. In the mean\r\ntime General Cope discharged several canon at us, but without effect.\r\n\r\nAt twilight the Prince drew off his men, and marched to Tranent. From\r\nhence he detached Lord Nairne, with 500 men, to guard the road that\r\nled from Preston to Edinburgh, to prevent Cope from marching thither.\r\nOn the other hand General Cope, afraid that the Prince should have\r\ndirected his march eastwards, altered his disposition, and faced east,\r\nhaving now the morass in front; and his troops were thus disposed.\r\nGeneral Hamilton’s dragoons were on his right, and Colonel Gardiners on\r\nhis left. The regiment of Lascelle’s and Murray, with five companies\r\nof Lees and four of Guises formed the center. And his second line\r\nconsisted of three companies of the Earl of Loudun’s regiment, two of\r\nLord John Murray’s, a body of Monros, and a great number of recruits\r\nfor regiments abroad. Amounting in all to about 2000 foot, and 700\r\ndragoons.\r\n\r\nAs it was now dark, the Prince ordered the army to march and to take\r\npossession of the ground on the south east of the morass which they\r\ndid, at about half canon shot of the enemy. We continued under arms in\r\nthe order of march, observing the greatest silence, so that Cope did\r\nnot perceive where we were.\r\n\r\nAbout three o’clock of the morning of the 21^{st}, orders were sent\r\nto Lord Nairne to draw off his guards and join the Prince, which he\r\nimmediately did. The disposition of the attack being made, the Prince\r\naddressed his army in these words--‘Follow me, gentlemen, by the\r\nassistance of God, I will this day make you a free and happy people.’\r\nThe right wing was commanded by the Duke of Perth, Lieutenant General,\r\nand consisted of the Macdonalds of Clanranald, Glengary, Keppoch and\r\nGlenco, and Grants of Glenmoriston. The left wing was commanded by\r\nLord George Murray, Lieutenant-General, and consisted of the Camerons\r\nof Lochiel, Stuarts of Appin, and two companies of Macgregors. The\r\nsecond line was commanded by Lord Nairne, Major-General, and consisted\r\nof Athole-men, Robertsons of Strouan, Maclauchlans, and the Duke of\r\nPerth’s men. About 25 gentlemen, and their servants, a horse-back,\r\nformed a sort of corps de reserve. The whole army consisted of about\r\n2200 men.\r\n\r\nWe marched chearfully on. The Duke of Perth was conducted by a\r\ngentleman, of the name of Anderson, by a ford through the above morass;\r\nwhere 100 men could have prevented our passage: it was so difficult\r\nthat every step the men made they sunk to the knee in mud. This made\r\nthem pass in some disorder, but not being observed, by means of the\r\ndarkness, they formed again as they passed the morass. But the Duke of\r\nPerth, in place of inclining to the enemy’s left, to avoid being seen\r\nby them before all our men were passed, marched towards the sea: so\r\nwhen our left gained the plain, Lord George Murray found that he was\r\nnearer the enemy than the Duke of Perth was. However, day beginning to\r\nbreak the attack was ordered.\r\n\r\nThe highlanders, pulling off their bonnets and looking up to heaven,\r\nmade a short prayer, and ran forward. In advancing Lord George Murray\r\nobserved, that by the turn of the morass, there was a great interval\r\nbetween his left and the ditch of the before mentioned inclosure: he\r\ntherefore ordered the Camerons to incline that way, in order to take it\r\nup, to prevent being flanked by the enemy’s dragoons. By this movement\r\nthere became a considerable interval in the center, which the 2^d line\r\nwas ordered to fill up. We were now discovered by the enemy, who played\r\ntheir artillery furiously upon our left; yet only one private man was\r\nkilled, and one officer wounded. The highlanders ran on with such\r\neagerness that they immediately seized the canon. The dragoons on right\r\nand left made a very regular fire, which was followed by close platoons\r\nof all their infantry, which our men received with great intrepidity.\r\nBut what by the huzzas of the highlanders, and their fire which was\r\nvery brisk, the dragoons were immediately thrown into disorder, which\r\noccasioned some confusion among their foot. The highlanders threw down\r\ntheir muskets, drew their swords, and carried all before them like a\r\ntorrent: so that in seven or eight minutes both horse and foot were\r\ntotally routed, and drove from the field of battle.\r\n\r\nThe Prince during the action was on foot in the 2^d line. He was with\r\ngreat difficulty prevailed on not to attack with the first line in so\r\nmuch that the officers refused to march if he insisted on it. As soon\r\nas the victory declared for him, he mounted his horse and put a stop to\r\nthe slaughter, calling out,--‘make prisoners: spare them, spare them,\r\nthey are my father’s subjects.’\r\n\r\nWhen General Cope saw how things were going, and that he could not\r\nrally his forces, he, with about 350 dragoons, and some volunteer\r\nofficers, gained Carberryhill, by a road that led to it from Preston,\r\nand, as we had not time, nor horse to pursue, got away undisturbed to\r\nLauder, and from thence to Berwick.\r\n\r\nAs our 2^d line had no occasion to engage, it may with justice be\r\nsaid, that 1400 highlanders, unsupported by horse or canon, routed\r\na regular army of 2000 foot and 700 dragoons, defended by a fine\r\ntrain of artillery, and obtained a most compleat victory. Such is the\r\nimpetuosity of a highland attack!\r\n\r\nWe took all the enemys canon, coehorns, small arms, colours, standards,\r\ndrums, tents, baggage and military chest, in which was about 3000^l.\r\n11^s.\r\n\r\nOf the enemy were killed about 500, wounded 400, and taken prisoners\r\n1400. Among the prisoners were about 80 officers.\r\n\r\nOur loss was very inconsiderable, viz. killed 2 captains, 1 Lieutenant,\r\n1 ensign, and about 30 private men; and wounded 6 officers, and 70\r\nprivate men.\r\n\r\nAll care immaginable was taken of the wounded, plenty of able surgeons\r\nhaving been provided for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Prince lay this night at Pinkie, and next day the 22^d returned to\r\nthe palace of Holyroodhouse, and the army encamped again at Duddingston.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE BATTLE OF FALKIRK,\r\n\r\nFOUGHT JANUARY 17^th, 1746\r\n\r\nLieutenant General Hawley, having been declared commander in chief in\r\nplace of Sir John Cope, marched from Edinburgh to raise the siege of\r\nStirling Castle, with about 10000 foot and 3 regiments of dragoons, and\r\nencamped a little to the westward of Falkirk.\r\n\r\nOn the 16^{th} the Prince drew up his army in line of battle, on a muir\r\nor plain, a mile south east of the house of Bannockburn, then his head\r\nquarters, and made all the necessary dispositions, in case the enemy\r\nshould have advanced to attack him. But Hawley continued all day in his\r\ncamp, and in the evening the Prince ordered his men to their quarters.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning, the 17^{th}, the Prince ordered his men to draw up\r\non the same plain. The right wing, commanded by Lord George Murray,\r\nconsisted of the Macgregors, Macdonalds of Keppoch, Clanronald,\r\nGlengary, and Glenco, Mackintoshes and Farquharsons. The left,\r\ncommanded by Lord John Drummond, consisted of the Camerons of Lochiel,\r\nStuarts of Appin, Macphersons of Cluny, Frazers of Lovat, and Macleods\r\nof Raza and Bernera. The 2^d line, commanded by Brigadier-General\r\nStappleton, consisted of the regiments of the Duke of Athole, Earl of\r\nCromarty, Lord Lewis Gordon, and Lord Ogilvy. Lords Elcho and Balmerino\r\nwith the Prince’s horse-guards, consisting of about 80 gentlemen and\r\ntheir servants, were placed on the right wing, between the first and\r\nsecond lines. Lords Pitsligo and Strathallan with the Aberdeen and\r\nPerth-shire squadrons of horse, and a few hussars, making about the\r\nsame number, were placed in like manner on the left. The Irish pickets\r\nwere placed immediately behind the 2^d line as a corps de reserve. The\r\nwhole making about 7000 foot, and 160 horse.\r\n\r\nThe regiments of the Duke of Perth, Lord John Drummond, Gordon of\r\nGlenbucket, and John Roy Stuart were left at Stirling to guard the\r\ntrenches and push on the siege, being about 1000 men. The Duke of\r\nPerth, who commanded the siege, and John Roy Stuart were allowed to\r\njoin the army to assist in the action: and the care of the siege was\r\nleft to Major-General Gordon of Glenbucket.\r\n\r\nAbout midday the Prince, finding that Hawley did not advance, resolved\r\nin a council of war to march and attack him. The army therefore marched\r\nin order of battle, in two columns, keeping always an equal distance\r\nof about 200 yards. This saved a great deal of time, and prevented\r\nconfusion, when we came within sight of the enemy. Lord George Murray\r\ntook the road to the south of the Torwood, as the highway leading from\r\nStirling to Falkirk was too narrow. At the same time Lord John Drummond\r\nwent with most of the horse to reconnoitre the enemy; and made a\r\nmovement as intending to march the highway through the Torwood.\r\n\r\nThe army crossed the water of Carron at Dunipace. By this time the\r\nenemy were perceived to be in motion. We therefore quickened our march\r\nto gain the top of the hill, about a mile south of the town of Falkirk,\r\nand a little more from Hawley’s camp.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hawley’s disposition seems to have been thus. On his right were\r\nthe Argyleshire militia, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Campbell,\r\nthe regiments of foot of Ligonier, Price and Sinclair: on his left\r\nLigonier, Cobham and Hamilton’s dragoons; the regiments of foot\r\nof Wolfe, Cholmondly and Pulteney. The 2^d line was made up of the\r\nregiments of foot of Blackney, Monro, Flemming, Barret and Battereau.\r\nThe Glasgow and some other militia, and Howard’s regiment of foot\r\nformed a corps de reserve.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawley, afraid lest the Prince intended to march south, and\r\nnot come to an action, ordered the dragoons to advance with all\r\nexpedition, to take possession of the hill, and to keep us in play\r\ntill the infantry should come up. When they came within canon shot,\r\nthey made a motion to attack our right in flank, which Lord George\r\nMurray perceiving he, with the assistance of Colonel John Roy Stuart,\r\nmade a very quick motion till he gained a morass, by which he saved\r\nbeing flanked. So our right was to the east, our left west, and front\r\nnorth. The dragoons seeing their scheme thus disappointed, advanced on\r\na full trot, in order to break us; but the Macgregors and Macdonalds,\r\nkeeping up their fire till they were within pistol shot, received them\r\nso briskly, that they were immediately broken, and thrown into the\r\nutmost confusion. As the enemy’s foot were now very near, the dragoons\r\ncould not easily retreat back, without breaking their own line: they\r\ntherefore gallopped along our line, whereby a vast number of them were\r\nkilled. This beginning greatly inspirited our men, as it had a contrary\r\neffect on the enemy.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the dragoons got off when their infantry advanced to make\r\nthe attack. They greatly out-lined us on the left, as we out-lined them\r\non the right. Our left extended little farther than to their center.\r\nBut from the unequality of the ground, being interspersed with risings\r\nand hollows, whereby there was no seeing from right to left what was\r\ndoing, neither of the parties reaped advantage from that circumstance.\r\nThe enemy’s right therefore attacked our left with a very close fire,\r\nwhich the Camerons and Stuarts received with great fortitude, drew\r\ntheir swords, broke and pursued them out of the field. Then our left\r\nmade a halt in order to be joined by the right; but were again attacked\r\nby other two regiments in flank, whom they also immediately broke. Our\r\nright, marching down the hill, fell in with the Glasgow militia, whom\r\nthey severely chastised.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, who was mostly in the center, and whose attention was\r\nturned to all parts, observing some regiments of the enemys foot, and\r\nthe remainder of the dragoons, marching up the hill, put himself at the\r\nhead of the Irish pickets, and such of the scattered highlanders as\r\nwere nearest to him, with a few gentlemen a horse-back, and advanced to\r\nattack them. But seeing the order of the pickets, and having a great\r\nstorm of wind and rain in their faces, they fled precipitantly to their\r\ncamp, as did all the rest of their troops.\r\n\r\nAs the action began late in the afternoon, it was now dark, the storm\r\nstill continuing. However, the Prince made all the dispatch immaginable\r\nto put his troops in order, as he intended to beat the enemy from\r\ntheir camp. But hardly were the half of our men drawn together, when\r\nwe observed many fires in Hawley’s camp, and his men at the same time\r\nmarching, with great hurry, between the camp and town of Falkirk. We\r\nimmediately conjectured that they were burning their camp (which they\r\nindeed endeavoured, but were prevented by the rain) and were to take\r\npossession of the town of Falkirk. Had they taken this course, a few\r\nmen properly posted could have hindered the highlanders from entering\r\nthat night, and obliged us either to have abandoned the field of\r\nbattle, or to have stood all night under arms, wet and fatigued as we\r\nwere, and exposed to the inclemency of the weather, a thing impossible.\r\n\r\nMr. Drummond, now Lord Strathallan, and Mr. Oliphant younger of Gask,\r\ndisguised in peasants dress, went into the town to reconnoitre, and to\r\nget intelligence of the enemy. They soon returned with information,\r\nthat they were flying in confusion to Linlithgow. The Prince\r\nimmediately ordered his men to march, and attack them in the rear. As\r\nwe marched we fell on the enemy’s canon, which they had left between\r\nthe field of battle and the town: they could not draw them up the hill,\r\non account of the badness of the roads; so they were of no use to them\r\nin the action.\r\n\r\nThe enemy’s rear were just got to the east end of the town, when Lord\r\nJohn Drummond entered it on that side: he was shot throw the arm by a\r\nsoldier, whom he was taking prisoner. Lord George Murray entered at the\r\nmiddle, and Lochiel at the west end of the town.\r\n\r\nOur men had no sooner entered the town than they disappeared on all\r\nsides; every one putting himself under cover to dry his cloaths; and\r\nrefresh himself after the fatigue of the day: and altho a detachment of\r\n1000 men were ordered to pursue the enemy, yet, such is the misfortune\r\nof an irregular army! not 50 could be brought together, besides those\r\nabsolutely necessary to mount the guards for the Prince and their own\r\nsafeties. So the enemy never stopped till they got to Linlithgow, and\r\nsome of their volunteers and dragoons to Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nThe Prince’s first care next morning was to send to reconnoitre the\r\nfield of battle, and cause bury the dead, as well those of the enemy\r\nas his own men. Some of their officers that could be distinguished, of\r\nwhom were Sir Robert Monroe and Colonel Whitney, were brought down to\r\nthe town, and interred in the same manner as our own officers were.\r\n\r\nIt now appeared that about 600 of the enemy were killed on the field of\r\nbattle, and that we had made about 700 prisoners.\r\n\r\nWe got all their artillery consisting of 7 large pieces of brass canon,\r\nand 3 iron ones, several mortars and coehorns, with a great many\r\nshells, all their ammunition, waggons, tents, 3 standards, 2 stand of\r\ncolours, a kettle drum, many small arms, baggage, and generally every\r\nthing that the rain prevented them from burning.\r\n\r\nOn our side were killed 3 captains, 4 subaltern officers, and about 40\r\nprivate men: and we had wounded near double that number.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE BATTLE OF CULLODEN,\r\n\r\nFOUGHT APRIL 16^{TH}, 1746\r\n\r\nAs soon as certain intelligence was brought that the Duke of Cumberland\r\nhad begun his march from Aberdeen northwards, the Prince sent orders to\r\nRoss, Sutherland, Lochaber, and Badenoch, that all the detachments of\r\nhis army, in these places, should join him immediately at Inverness.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland passed the Spey on the 13th, and on the 14th\r\nencamped at Nairn, about 10 miles from Culloden. On this the Prince\r\nassembled his men in and about Inverness, and marched at their head to\r\nCulloden-house, where he lay that night, and the troops encamped in the\r\nParks.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning, the Prince drew up his army in line of battle,\r\nupon Drummossie muir, south of the house and parks of Culloden, as he\r\nexpected that the Duke of Cumberland would have attacked him that day,\r\nbeing his birth-day.\r\n\r\nAbout noon, when we were informed that he had not moved, it was\r\nproposed to the Prince to make a night attack upon him, in his camp\r\nat Nairn. Various were the reasons for and against this proposal. And\r\nafter considering them fully, the Prince approved of the project, as\r\nthe most probable chance he had of beating the enemy; provided they\r\ncould be surprised by one o’clock of the morning.\r\n\r\nWe must here observe, that the Duke of Cumberland’s army was double the\r\nnumber of ours, plentifully provided with money and provisions of all\r\nkinds; having a squadron of ships, loaded with stores, that coasted\r\nalong, from Aberdeen to Inverness, in sight of his army, to supply him\r\nwith whatever was necessary. Whereas our military chest was spent; the\r\nmen had not received pay for some time, had got no provisions this day\r\nbut a single bisket each, and were much fatigued by severe duty.\r\n\r\nIn this situation the Prince could not propose to keep his army\r\ntogether. He was obliged either to fight or starve. And altho above\r\n3000 men, under the command of the Earl of Cromarty, Macdonald of\r\nBarisdale, Macgregor of Glengyle, Cluny Macpherson, and others, who\r\nwere expected every hour, had not yet joined, he resolved to risk the\r\nevent of an engagement.\r\n\r\nThe night attack being therefore agreed to, was to have been executed\r\nthus. One third of the army, commanded by Lord George Murray, were to\r\nhave passed the water of Nairn, two miles below Culraick, and two from\r\nNairn, to have attacked the enemy on the south east near to the sea;\r\nwhilst the other two thirds, under the command of the Duke of Perth\r\nand his brother Lord John Drummond, were to have attacked them on the\r\nplain, from the north east and all the way to the sea, so as to have\r\njoined those who were to have attacked on the other side.\r\n\r\nThat our design might not be discovered by the enemy, the march began\r\nabout eight o’clock at night. Lord George Murray led the van. He had\r\nalong with him, besides several gentlemen volunteers and officers, 30\r\nmen of the Mackintoshes, who lived in that very country, as guides.\r\nThey conducted him the moor road, that he might not fall in with the\r\nenemy’s patrolls; and small parties were stationed at proper distances\r\nto prevent the enemy from receiving any intelligence.\r\n\r\nAs the highlanders had often marched more than two miles in an hour, it\r\nwas hoped that they could have reached Nairn before two o’clock. But\r\nbefore Lord George had marched a mile, he received a message that the\r\nhalf of the line was at a considerable distance, and orders to halt,\r\nor march slower, till the line should join. He received many messages\r\nby aides-de-camps and other officers, sent for the same purpose, by\r\nthe time he had reached six miles. Altho he did not halt, he marched\r\nalways slower, hoping that would do: For he knew that a halt in the\r\nvan occasions a greater one in the rear, when the march begins again;\r\nwhereas by marching slow, the rear might have joined without that\r\ninconveniency.\r\n\r\nIt was already near two o’clock in the morning, and the van near\r\nfour miles from the enemy. Most of the officers of distinction were\r\nnow come up to the front; particularly the Duke of Perth, Lord John\r\nDrummond, Lochiel and his brother, and M. oSulivan. The Duke of Perth\r\ntold Lord George Murray that unless he made a halt the center and rear\r\ncolumns could not join. We halted. Here the officers began to examine\r\ntheir present situation. They were of opinion, that by the time the\r\nline had joined, and the army advanced two miles farther, it would be\r\nday light, and consequently the enemy would have time to point their\r\ncanon, draw up their men, and place their horse so as to act in the\r\nmost advantagious manner. Besides, a great number of our men had left\r\ntheir ranks and lain down in the wood of Culraick, which must have\r\nproceeded from faintness for want of food, and not from the fatigue\r\nof a six miles march. In these circumstances the attack was judged\r\nimpracticable. To get back to Culloden, so as the men could have some\r\nhours refreshment, in case they should be obliged to fight that day,\r\nwas what they agreed to.\r\n\r\nAs the Prince was about a mile behind in the rear, and the road through\r\nthe wood very difficult to pass, they thought it would consume too much\r\ntime to send back for orders, Lord George Murray therefore ordered\r\nthe retreat. The Duke of Perth went back to acquaint the Prince with\r\nthis resolution. At first he seemed much surprised, on which the Duke\r\noffered to march back the men; but after some reflection, he saw it was\r\nthen too late.\r\n\r\nWe marched back the shortest way, as we had not the same reason for\r\nshuning houses in returning as we had in advancing.\r\n\r\nThe van had only got to the Church of Cray, that is two miles from\r\nwhere the halt was made, when it was broad day light. This showed that\r\nthe enemy could not have been surprised as was intended. However, had\r\nthe center and rear marched as quick as the van, it might certainly\r\nhave been done.\r\n\r\nBetween 5 and 6 o’clock, all the army reached Culloden: But many, as\r\nwell officers as soldiers went to Inverness and places adjacent, in\r\nquest of provisions, which were difficult to find.\r\n\r\nThe Prince had scarcely reposed himself an hour, when accounts were\r\nbrought, that the enemy was in full march to attack him. He immediately\r\nsent aid-de-camps to bring up the men, who were at Inverness. In\r\nthe mean time he marched up the troops that were about Culloden to\r\nDrummossie muir; but half a mile nearer than where they were formed the\r\npreceeding day.\r\n\r\nThis was our order of battle. The right wing, commanded by Lord George\r\nMurray, consisted of his own regiment of Athol, Camerons of Lochiel,\r\nStuarts of Appin, one battallion of the Frazers of Lovat, and the\r\nMackintoshes. The left wing, commanded by the Duke of Perth, consisted\r\nof the Macdonalds of Glengary, Keppoch and Clanranald, two companies\r\nof Macleans, two companies of Macleods, and the Farquharsons. The 2^d\r\nline, commanded by Lord John Drummond and Major General Stappleton,\r\nconsisted of the Irish piquets, the regiments of Lord Ogilvy, Lord\r\nLewis Gordon, Duke of Perth, and Lord John Drummond. On the right wing,\r\nbehind the 2^d line, was a troop of Fitz-james’s horse; and on the left\r\nthe horse guards, Perth-shire squadron and Hussards. The regiments of\r\nthe Earl of Kilmarnock’s foot guards, and Colonel John Roy Stuart, with\r\nsuch of our men as had no guns formed a sort of reserve.\r\n\r\nThe whole did not exceed 6000 foot and 150 horse. We had six pieces of\r\ncanon, two placed on the right, two on the left, and two in the center\r\nof the front line. Our front was to the east.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland drew up his army in three lines. The first,\r\ncommanded by Lieutenant-General the Earl of Albemarle, consisted of\r\nthe regiments of Barrel, Monro, Scot’s Fusileers, Price, Cholmondley\r\nand Sinclair. The 2^d, commanded by Major General Huske, consisted of\r\nthe regiments of Wolfe, Ligonier, Sempil, Bligh, and Flemming. The\r\n3^d line, commanded by Brigadier Mordant, consisted of the regiments\r\nof Blackeney, Battereau, Pulteney and Howard. On the right wing were\r\nplaced Cobham’s dragoons, and the half of Kingston’s horse, with the\r\nCampbells of Argyle.\r\n\r\nHad these regiments been all compleat, they should have amounted to\r\n15000 men, but as they were they surely amounted to near 12000 foot\r\nand 1200 horse. Ten pieces of canon were placed in the first line, two\r\nbetween each regiment; and six pieces in the 2^d line.\r\n\r\nThe enemy formed at a considerable distance, and marched in order of\r\nbattle. About two o’clock afternoon the canonading began.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, after riding along the lines to animate the men, placed\r\nhimself about the center, that he might the more conveniently give his\r\norders. The enemy’s canon galled us much. One of the Prince’s servants,\r\nwho led a sumpter horse, was killed at his side.\r\n\r\nWe were greatly out-lined both on right and left. Some alterations\r\nwere made in our disposition in order to remedy this. Our right was\r\ncovered by some old park walls, that led towards the water of Nairn.\r\nThe Campbells got behind these walls, pulled them down, and placed a\r\nbattery of canon, which did great execution on our right.\r\n\r\nThe Prince ordered to begin the attack. Our men attacked with all the\r\nfury imaginable, and made several impressions on the enemys line;\r\nparticularly the Athol-men broke entirely the regiments of Barret\r\nand Monro, and took possession of two pieces of canon. But the enemy\r\nkeeping a close hedge fire, overpowering us with numbers, and attacking\r\nus on both flanks, threw our lines into great confusion, and at last\r\nobliged us to quit the field. The Duke of Cumberland was likewise\r\nassisted by a great storm of hail and rain that blew in our faces.\r\n\r\nThe Prince did all he could to rally his men, but to no purpose. He was\r\ntherefore obliged to retire. He crossed the water of Nairn at the ford\r\non the high way between Inverness and Corryburgh, and then went to Lord\r\nLovats. The greatest part of the army went to Ruthven in Badennoch.\r\n\r\nAs we had not afterwards an opportunity of reviewing our men, we cannot\r\nexactly say what loss we sustained in the action. By the enemy’s\r\naccount we lost 2000 men, and they 300. But there is reason to think,\r\nthat on the one side they magnify, and on the other diminish the\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n    ‘Cum rectè factorum sibi quisque gratiam trahat, unius invidiâ ab\r\n    omnibus peccatur.’ Tac. Ann. 1. 3 c. 53.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nTHE JACOBITE LORD SEMPILL\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Fitzroy Bell, in a note to Murray’s _Memorials_ (p. 42), relates\r\nthat he had been unable to discover who this Jacobite Lord Sempill\r\nwas. The researches of the Marquis de Ruvigny among the Stuart Papers,\r\npublished in the _Jacobite Peerage_, make his identity quite clear.\r\nFrancis Sempill was the son and heir of Robert Sempill, an officer in\r\nthe French army. In 1712 this Robert Sempill received from the court\r\nof St. Germains a ‘Declaration of Noblesse,’ which stated that he ‘is\r\ngrandson of the late Hugh, Lord Sempill, Peer of Scotland and sole\r\nheir-male of the property and the ancient title of the said lord, whose\r\nfourth son, Archibald, father of the said Robert, is the only one\r\nwho left any living male child.’ On the 16th of July 1723 he appears\r\nas Mr. Robert Sempill, Captain of the Regiment of Dillon. He died at\r\nParis intestate. In the documents of probate he is termed ‘Robert, Lord\r\nSempill, _alias_ Robert Sempill.’ On the strength of the title given to\r\nhim in this reference, the Marquis de Ruvigny states that after 1723,\r\nwhen he was termed simply ‘Mr. Robert Sempill,’ he ‘seems after that\r\ndate to have been created by James III. and VIII. a lord and peer of\r\nParliament.’ This assumption has also been made by Mr. Fitzroy Bell,\r\nMr. Andrew Lang, and other recent writers, but there is no evidence of\r\nany new creation, nor indeed was there any necessity for it. Robert\r\nSempill the soldier had received in 1712 the declaration that he was\r\nentitled to the ancient title, but apparently had not used it. It seems\r\nnatural to believe that his son Francis, who on the death of the father\r\nwould prepare the probate papers, inserted in them the title of lord,\r\nto which the Declaration of 1712 said his father was entitled, and that\r\non succeeding he assumed the title which his father had not used.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the relationship of the Jacobite Lord Sempill\r\nwith the nobleman who bore the same title in Scotland. He fought at\r\nCulloden and died the same year at Aberdeen (see p. 164).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          HUGH, 5TH LORD SEMPILL, d. 1639.\r\n                                        |\r\n           +------------------+---------+-------------------------+\r\n           |                  |                                   |\r\n    Francis, d. 1640,  Robert, d. 1675,                      Archibald.\r\n        6th lord.         7th lord.                               |\r\n                              |                                   |\r\n                   +----------+-------+                           |\r\n                   |                  |                           |\r\n          Francis, d. 1684,    Anne, Lady Sempill,                |\r\n             8th lord.             d. 1695,              Robert, d. 1737.\r\n                              m.

On the\r\naccession of William and Mary and the Abolition of Episcopacy and the\r\nEstablishment of the Presbyterian Church, all the bishops refused the\r\nOath to the new Sovereigns, and a large number of the clergy left their\r\nparishes for the same reason.\r\n\r\nAt first there was much toleration, but as the bishops and the\r\nEpiscopal clergy were all Non-jurors and maintained their allegiance to\r\nthe exiled Stuart kings, they gradually became a Jacobite institution.\r\nAlthough very feeble, they were torn with internal dissension both\r\ndoctrinal and ecclesiastical. As the pre-Revolution bishops died\r\nout, it was thought necessary in order to keep up the succession to\r\nconsecrate new bishops, but this had to be done with utmost secrecy.\r\n\r\nAt first these bishops were appointed bishops at large without\r\nany diocese or territorial jurisdiction, and were known as the\r\nCollege of Bishops, but gradually the clergy demanded some sort of\r\nsuperintendence. Bishops were consecrated by one party and by others,\r\nbut all on the understanding that they owed allegiance to the Stuart\r\nking. To avoid scandal the Jacobite managers and the Jacobite Court\r\ninsisted that when bishops were elected the king should be informed\r\nso as to give _congé d’élire_ before consecration. This power was\r\nafterwards compromised by the exiled king permitting the clergy\r\nto select all the bishops except the metropolitans of St. Andrews\r\nand Glasgow, and a Bishop of Edinburgh who might have to act as\r\nmetropolitan under the title of Vicar-General of St. Andrews.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1741 John Murray, as Agent in Scotland for the Jacobite\r\nCourt, sent up the name of William Harper, who was incumbent of St.\r\nPaul’s Non-juring Episcopal Church in Carrubber’s Close. He was well\r\nconnected, being married to a daughter of Sir David Thriepland of\r\nFingask, and he was also principal adviser to most of the prominent\r\nJacobites of the time.\r\n\r\nSome of the bishops did not want him, and Bishop Keith represented to\r\nthe Chevalier through Murray that Harper was an objectionable person,\r\nand implored the king to withdraw his _congé d’élire_. Mr. Harper\r\nretired from the contest.\r\n\r\nAfter much negotiation John Murray, apparently with the concurrence of\r\nthe majority of the bishops, fixed upon Bishop Rattray as a man likely\r\nfrom his age and rank to put an end to the dissensions; and James\r\nsent from Rome a _congé de lire_ to elect him Bishop of Edinburgh,\r\napparently with certain metropolitan powers. Rattray, however, died a\r\nfew days after this permission was received, and the see was not filled\r\nuntil 1776.\r\n\r\nBishop Rattray was a Perthshire laird, the head of the ancient\r\nfamily of Rattray of Craighall. His son John acted as surgeon to\r\nPrince Charles throughout the campaign of 1745-46. A volume recently\r\npublished, _A Jacobite Stronghold of the Church_, by Mary E. Ingram\r\n(Edinburgh, 1907), gives much information about William Harper and the\r\nEpiscopal Church in Jacobite times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III\r\n\r\nSIR JAMES STEUART\r\n\r\n\r\nSir James Steuart (afterwards Steuart Denham) of Goodtrees and\r\nColtness, second baronet. His father had been Solicitor-General, and\r\nhis grandfather Lord Advocate, and both belonged to the party of the\r\nCovenanters. Sir James was born in 1712, and in 1743 he married Lady\r\nFrances, daughter of the fourth Earl of Wemyss, and sister of Lord\r\nElcho, one of the Jacobite leaders of the ’Forty-five. When Prince\r\nCharles came to Edinburgh, Sir James joined his Court, and he is the\r\nreputed author of some of the Prince’s manifestos. In the autumn of\r\n1745 he was sent to France as the Prince’s agent.\r\n\r\nIn the Stuart Papers there is a document headed ‘A Copy of Sir James\r\nStewart’s powers, Dec. 29, 1746.’\r\n\r\n    ‘Nous Charles Prince de Galles Regent des Royaumes d’Angleterre,\r\n    d’Ecosse, etc. jugeant qu’il est notre service dans la\r\n    conjouncture presente de charger de nos affaires auprès de Sa\r\n    Majesté très-chretienne une personne instruite de nos intentions\r\n    nous avons choisi le Chevalier Baronet Stuart auquel nous avons\r\n    donné et donnons pouvoir, commission, et mandement special\r\n    de traitter et negotier avec les ministres de Sa Majesté\r\n    [très-chrètienne] arrester, conclure et signer avec eux tous les\r\n    articles ou conventions qu’il avisera bon être.... Fait a Paris\r\n    ce 29 Decembre 1746.’\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a copy of the credential which he received in\r\nEdinburgh, and which, probably for precautionary reasons, he did not\r\ncarry with him in case of being captured and searched. The whole\r\ncommission is printed among the Stuart Papers in Browne’s _History of\r\nthe Highlands_, vol. iii. p. 472.\r\n\r\nSir James was specially excepted from the Act of Indemnity of 1747. He\r\nwandered on the Continent until 1763, when he was permitted to return\r\nto Scotland. He received a pardon in 1771, and died in 1780. He was\r\nauthor of _Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy_ (1767),\r\nand other works. There is information about his Jacobite career in the\r\nnarratives of his brother-in-law, Lord Elcho, recently published, also\r\na long biography in _The Coltness Collections_, in which every effort\r\nis made to ignore or minimise his Jacobitism.\r\n\r\nThere was something mysterious both about his joining the Jacobite\r\nCourt and about his departure from Scotland. Robert Chambers, in his\r\n_History of the Rebellion_, chap. xxiv., relates, upon the authority of\r\nSir Henry Steuart of Allanton, Sir James’s near relative, the story of\r\nhis joining the Prince at Holyrood, which may be told in Chambers’s own\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n    ‘Descended of a whig family, Sir James had, nevertheless, allowed\r\n    himself, in the course of his travels, to form an intimacy with\r\n    the Stuart princes and some of their principal adherents. He\r\n    had more lately been piqued at the treatment he had received\r\n    at an election from one of the officers of the government. He\r\n    was disposed to join the enterprise of the Prince, but wished\r\n    that, in doing so, he should not appear quite a free agent. His\r\n    sister’s husband, the Earl of Buchan, a good man, of moderate\r\n    understanding, was brought by him to the same views, and they\r\n    agreed with Lady Steuart’s brother, Lord Elcho, that they should\r\n    be seized in a public place, and carried to Holyrood House, as if\r\n    against their will. Walking next day at the cross of Edinburgh,\r\n    Sir James and the earl were seized accordingly, and conducted\r\n    to the palace. There a message was sent from an anteroom to the\r\n    Chevalier, mentioning their presence. The Prince, who in the\r\n    meanwhile had heard of the manner of their visit, returned for\r\n    answer, that if the Earl of Buchan and Sir James Steuart came\r\n    as willing partisans to befriend his cause, he should be proud\r\n    and happy to see them, but not otherwise. This bluntness, though\r\n    honourable to the Prince’s candour, displeased Buchan, whose\r\n    resolution, perhaps, had already begun to give way. He therefore\r\n    made a low bow to the officer, and said: “Please inform his royal\r\n    highness that I have the honour to be his most obedient humble\r\n    servant”; after which he instantly left the palace. Sir James,\r\n    too much offended with the government to retrace his steps,\r\n    remained to see the Prince upon the terms prescribed.’\r\n\r\nThere was something still more mysterious about his departure. The\r\nfollowing depositions were found in the Records of the Sheriff Court\r\nof Kincardineshire by Dr. W. A. Macnaughton of Stonehaven,[639] who\r\nkindly sent them to me. The depositions were taken from witnesses in\r\na civil action of false imprisonment by James Grant against Alexander\r\nGarioch of Mergie. Garioch acted as deputy governor of Stonehaven for\r\nPrince Charles. Apparently the authorities took the opportunity of\r\ninterrogating the Jacobite witnesses about Sir James. The portions of\r\nthe depositions that refer to Sir James Steuart only are here given.\r\n\r\n    1. PETER BARCLAY of Johnstoun[640] ... Being Interrogate\r\n    concerning Sir James Stewart Depones that some time about the\r\n    middle of November or a little before it, the Deponent had\r\n    occasion to be at Stonhyve in a Tavern with Mr. Garioch, that\r\n    he saw a person who passed under the Name of Brown, and who was\r\n    called by Mergie to the Deponent a Prisoner, but that there was\r\n    no guard sett upon him and the Deponent saw him at liberty to go\r\n    out and in under no confinement that the Deponent could observe,\r\n    That the Deponent had had occasion about sixteen years before\r\n    to be in company with Sir James Stewart That when the Deponent\r\n    saw this person who was called Brown he thought he had seen him\r\n    before, but could not then recollect who he was That the day\r\n    after the Deponent had seen this person he was conversing with\r\n    one Menzies in the French service was enquiring who this person\r\n    might be and was positive he had seen him before, That Menzies\r\n    said he did not know who he was, but that some days before Lord\r\n    Lewis Gordon had been dining with him, and he observed that Lord\r\n    Lewis was Drinking to this person his health That upon this the\r\n    Deponent recollected and said he imagined him to be Sir James\r\n    Stuart, Depones that when that person was ordered to be taken\r\n    on board of a ffrench ship by Mergie’s command he took a formal\r\n    protest in waiting against Mergie for forcing him out of the\r\n    Kingdom against his will, Being interrogate if he thought it was\r\n    a serious protest Depones that he did not know what to think of\r\n    it but was very much surprised at the whole proceeding and that\r\n    when the Deponent said to Mergie that he judged this person to\r\n    be Sir James Stuart, Mergie absolutely refused that it was, that\r\n    this person went down to the Boat in order to embark aboard of\r\n    the ship which lay at anchor without any guard attending him,\r\n    Mergie and the Deponent and several others went along with him to\r\n    the Boat.\r\n\r\n    4. JOHN MAULE[641] Depones that some time in October 1745 a\r\n    ffrench ship arrived in the Harbour of Stonhyve with some chests\r\n    of Arms, six pieces of cannon, and other warlike stores, That\r\n    Mergie received from the Hands of one Black, who called himself\r\n    Supercargo of the said Ship all these Warlike Instruments, and\r\n    called in the country to assist in carrying them southwards,\r\n    Depones that the above mentioned Black went south along with\r\n    the cargo of Arms etc. which were brought from on board the\r\n    above mentioned vessel, and returned again in about 2 weeks\r\n    after he arrived at the Publick House keeped by John Falconer\r\n    and that there was in his company as the Deponent had occasion\r\n    to see immediately after his arrival a Gentleman unknown to the\r\n    Deponent, that when the Deponent enquired at Black who this\r\n    Person was Black told him he had met with him at Montrose,\r\n    and believed him to be one of the officers who had been taken\r\n    Prisoner at the Battle of Prestonpans and had made his Escape\r\n    That Black desired the Deponent to go to Mergie and inform him\r\n    that there was such a Gentleman at Mr. Falconer’s house whom he\r\n    suspected to be an officer of General Cope’s Army who had made\r\n    his escape, That the deponent delivered this message to Mergie,\r\n    upon which Mergie came directly up to the Mill of Stonhyve\r\n    That the Deponent accompanied Mergie with a Guard, That Mergie\r\n    and Black took the said Person unknown to the Deponent into\r\n    an Apartment by themselves, and after staying about an Hour\r\n    returned again and showed to the Deponent a Black Cockade and\r\n    about sixty or seventy Pistoll shot, which he said he had found\r\n    upon searching about this unknown Person, and ordered him to be\r\n    keeped Prisoner, and accordingly a Guard was placed upon the\r\n    House all that night That next day the Deponent was sent for by\r\n    Mergie and received orders from him to Remove the Guard which\r\n    was upon the said unknown person, and to take the Custody and\r\n    care of him himself, and desired him to keep sight of him and\r\n    not suffer him to make his Escape, That for two or three days\r\n    the Deponent keept a pritty watchful eye over the said unknown\r\n    Gentleman during the daytime and at night there was always a\r\n    Guard of three or four men placed on the House But after that\r\n    during his stay in Stonhyve the Deponent sometimes attended the\r\n    said Gentleman when he walked for his Recreation any distance\r\n    from the Town but he was left for most part without any guard\r\n    or attendance That during the time of the said person’s stay at\r\n    Stonhyve Mergie was frequently in company with him at Dinner and\r\n    Supper and frequently they were alone together Depones that\r\n    one day when the deponent was in the laigh Room of the Mill of\r\n    Stonhyve he heard this unknown Gentleman and the first and second\r\n    Master of the abovementioned French ship in company in the Room\r\n    immediately above, That the Deponent heard them laughing and\r\n    very merry together, that they were speaking ffrench and so loud\r\n    that if the deponent had understood it, he might have heard what\r\n    they said very well, That after the abovementioned Company above\r\n    stairs had parted, the Deponent met with the second master of the\r\n    French vessel and asked him how it came about that he was so very\r\n    familiar and so free in the Company of that gentleman who was\r\n    a Prisoner, Oh! said the master in English which he spoke very\r\n    well, you are quite mistaken, this is one of our own friends,\r\n    Depones that to the best of the Deponent’s remembrance this\r\n    Person staid in town about eight or ten days, that when the Ship\r\n    was ready to sail Mergie signed a formal Warrand for Transporting\r\n    him in the said ship to France, and a Guard was placed in order\r\n    to convey him to the Boat, That the said Person took a formal\r\n    protest agt. Mergie for sending him out of the Kingdom against\r\n    his Will, and being Interrogate if he understood the said Protest\r\n    to be serious Depones that he did not know what to think of\r\n    it and was very much surprised when he considered of all the\r\n    proceedings in relation to this person from first to last, how\r\n    he was upon his first arrival under a strick Guard afterwards\r\n    very much at Liberty and last of all formally sent aboard of the\r\n    ship to be transported seemingly against his will, That when this\r\n    Person was going into the Boat and taking his leave of other\r\n    people upon the shoar he came up to the deponent and embracing\r\n    him very kindly, told him that he was very sensible of his\r\n    civilities, and would represent his good Behaviour to people that\r\n    he did not then think of, Depones that he remembers when this\r\n    person was in Stonhyve, there was an attempt made by the _Ludlow\r\n    Castle_, a Ship belonging to the King’s Navy, to force the\r\n    harbour by her boat with about fifty men or thereby, That upon\r\n    this Occasion the unknown person above mentioned was very active\r\n    in assisting and directing the French crew about the manner of\r\n    Planting their Battery and Defending the Harbour in which he\r\n    seemed to have skill, Depones that Mergie at first when this\r\n    person was committed to the Deponent’s custody charged him to\r\n    be very strict in his Watch over him, but shortly after desired\r\n    him to be easy with him and let him go about his business as he\r\n    pleased Depones that he would know this person if he saw him\r\n    again But that he knew nothing who he was during the Time of his\r\n    stay at Stonhyve, that shortly after he heard from people that\r\n    came from the south that it was Sir James Stewart That a few days\r\n    after the said person came to Stonhyve Sir Alexander Bannerman\r\n    came and waited upon him at the Mill of Stonhyve immediately\r\n    after the Deponent received Orders from Mergie not to be strict\r\n    in his guard over the said person Depones that when he saw the\r\n    said Person so very active in giving directions about planting\r\n    the Cannon against the King’s Boat which attempted the Harbour he\r\n    did then and not till then suspect that his being a Prisoner was\r\n    a Farce.\r\n\r\n    6. WILLIAM HERDMAN ... Being Interrogate concerning Sir James\r\n    Stewart Depones that he had occasion to see and be in company\r\n    sometimes with a Gentleman who was said to be a Prisoner, That\r\n    for several days after his arrival he was strictly guarded, but\r\n    after that was left at large to go where he pleased, That one\r\n    Black who came over as Supercargo on board a French vessel and\r\n    had gone to the south about three weeks before Returned again in\r\n    company with this unknown gentleman, That he said he had met with\r\n    this Gentleman upon the Road but did not know who he was, That\r\n    the Deponent sincerely believed this gentleman by his behaviour\r\n    and conversation to be a person well affected to the Government,\r\n    till the _Ludlow Castle_, one of His Majesty’s Ships, appeared\r\n    and attempted to make the Harbour with her long Boat and some\r\n    men on board, upon which occasion the Deponent observed that\r\n    this gentleman seemed to be in some hurry and concern and as the\r\n    Deponent was passing near to the Harbour he saw this gentleman\r\n    and Mr. Black standing together and heard the said gentleman\r\n    calling out with an appearance of solicitude and Keenness to the\r\n    people who were driving down Dung to the shore for Defence of the\r\n    Harbour, to go faster, or saying something to that purpose which\r\n    occasioned in the Deponent a strong suspicion that he was in\r\n    reality in the interest of the Pretender’s Party But after that\r\n    when he saw him carried down to the ship like a Criminal with a\r\n    Guard about him, the Deponent was confounded and did not know\r\n    what to think of it, That sometime thereafter the Deponent heard\r\n    a Rumor in the Country that it was Sir James Stewart, after that\r\n    Mergie told him that it was Sir James Stewart and Jocked at his\r\n    ignorance in Imagining that he was really a Prisoner.\r\n\r\n    7. JOHN LAWSON, Doctor,[642] ... Being Interrogate concerning\r\n    Sir James Stewart Depones that sometime towards the end of 1745\r\n    there arrived a ffrench ship in the Harbour of Stonhyve That one\r\n    Black who was said to be supercargo of the said ship came and\r\n    Lodged in the Deponent’s House That shortly after his arrival he\r\n    went south, and about a fortnight or three weeks thereafter the\r\n    said Mr. Black returned and arrived at the Mill of Stonhyve and\r\n    in his company there was an unknown Gentleman who was immediately\r\n    taken as a Prisoner by Mergie, That the Deponent had occasion to\r\n    see the said Gentleman about an Hour after his arrival and saw\r\n    Weileyes (? valise) or a Bagg which the Deponent was told Mergie\r\n    had searched, and in which nothing was remarkable but a small\r\n    Duck Bagg with some Pistoll Ball in it and a Black Cockade, That\r\n    the Deponent observed about three or four days after his arrival\r\n    he was more at liberty only John Maule Writer in Stonhyve was\r\n    said always to have him in custody, the Deponent has seen him\r\n    alone without anybody looking after him, That some days after his\r\n    arrival Sir Alexr. Bannerman came to Stonhyve Depones that he had\r\n    a strong Impression from what he heard talked of frequently that\r\n    this Person’s Confinement was only a Farce, That the Deponent\r\n    heard some time after the said Gentleman was put on board the\r\n    French ship that he was Sir James Stewart of Goodtrees.\r\n\r\n    8. JOHN FALCONER[643] ... Being Interrogate concerning Sir James\r\n    Stewart Depones that a person unknown to him, said to be a\r\n    Prisoner of Mergie’s and passed under the name of Brown lodged in\r\n    his House, that after the first three or four days he was left\r\n    at Liberty to go where he pleased either upon foot or Horseback\r\n    upon Parole as the Deponent heard to Mergie, and the Deponent\r\n    thinks he could have easily made his escape if he had a mind the\r\n    Deponent has seen him frequently privately in company with Mergie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IV\r\n\r\nTHE GUILDHALL RELIEF FUND\r\n\r\n\r\nThis fund, in the distribution of which Walter Grossett was concerned,\r\nand of which his brother’s widow and children were the largest\r\nbeneficiaries, was probably the earliest example of systematic\r\norganisation for the supply of comforts to soldiers in the field, to\r\nthe sick and wounded, and for provision for widows and orphans.\r\n\r\nThe fund was instituted at the Guildhall, London, on November 27th,\r\n1745, by Sir Richard Hoare, then Lord Mayor. The minute of the first\r\nmeeting aptly declares the intention of the founders:--\r\n\r\n    ‘We whose names are underwritten, in Consideration of the\r\n    particular Hardships and Inconveniencies which may be suffer’d\r\n    by such Soldiers as now are, or shall hereafter be employ’d\r\n    in his Majesty’s Service during the Winter Season, towards\r\n    the Suppression of the present unnatural Rebellion, do hereby\r\n    voluntarily Subscribe and pay the several Sums set by us against\r\n    our respective Names to be applied towards their Relief, Support,\r\n    and Encouragement, in such manner, and in such Proportion, as\r\n    shall be deem’d to be most necessary and expedient by a Committee\r\n    which shall hereafter be appointed for that Purpose by Us, or the\r\n    Major Part who shall be present at any General Meeting, pursuant\r\n    to an Advertisement in the _London Gazette_.’\r\n\r\nThe result of the efforts of the Lord Mayor and his associates is\r\nrecorded in an admirable report printed in 1747.\r\n\r\nThe report gives a subscription list. There were exactly five hundred\r\nsubscriptions, and the total amount subscribed was £18,910, 0s. 9d. The\r\nlargest subscription was that of ‘the Rt. Hon. Lord Chief Justice,\r\nMaster of the Rolls, Lord Chief Justice Willes, Lord Chief Baron\r\nParker, and the Honourable Judges, whose gift was £1200; the smallest\r\nthat of the parish of St. Thomas, Southwark, which gave 10s. 9d. In\r\nthe List are found subscriptions from the Prince of Wales, £500; the\r\nMayor, Commonalty, and Citizens of the City of London, £1000; Governor\r\nand Company of the Bank of England, £1000; John Rich from the Theatre\r\nRoyal in Covent Garden, £602, 7s.; the Gentlemen Volunteers of the City\r\nof London, £523, 19s. The City Companies subscribe sums varying from\r\n£100 to £300, and it is interesting to find in the list the name of\r\nIsaac Watts, D.D., for a subscription of £5, 5s. The Report, which is\r\nan excellent business document, finishes with the following paragraph:--\r\n\r\n    ‘In this Manner your Committee propose that the Conclusion of\r\n    this Subscription should be agreeable to the Design of its\r\n    original Institution; since every Calamity you can remove, or\r\n    every Comfort you can bestow on Behalf of the private Soldier,\r\n    will be giving them so much new Strength and Vigour to act in\r\n    Defence of our Liberties, and Support of our Constitution;\r\n    wherein both Interest and Duty, both publick Safety and publick\r\n    Charity, may be jointly urged as Motives to your Benevolence. And\r\n    as to what has already been expended, if Relief under Sickness,\r\n    if Support under Fatigue, if Encouragement under Dangers, are to\r\n    be esteemed Acts of Humanity or Beneficence, by how much stronger\r\n    Ties were we called upon to return such Assistance to those who\r\n    under the greatest Hazards and Difficulties were protecting us\r\n    in the Enjoyment of every Thing that was dear and valuable: And\r\n    your Committee flatter themselves that the Zeal which was exerted\r\n    on this Occasion, by the Magistrates, Merchants, and other\r\n    Inhabitants of this Metropolis, contributed no less to dispirit\r\n    the Enemy, than it did to animate our own Forces, until they\r\n    obtained that compleat Victory over the Rebels, which so happily\r\n    preserved the Religion, Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom, the\r\n    inseparable Blessings of his Majesty’s Government.’\r\n\r\nDetails of the disbursements of the Fund are given in appendices which\r\nare printed below, and are interesting in the present time of war for\r\nthe sake of comparison with similar modern activities. They are printed\r\nfrom an original copy of the Report in the editor’s possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Appendix No. I. is the List of Subscriptions.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX No. II\r\n\r\nAn ACCOUNT of the Necessaries contracted for, their Patterns and Price.\r\n\r\n    STOCKINGS.\r\n\r\n    Long Hose, furnished by Mr. _Stiles_, made in\r\n    _Westmoreland_, and by him delivered at 12_s._\r\n    _per_ Dozen Pair                                        10,000 Pair.\r\n\r\n    (Short Hose.)

The manuscript bears the following endorsement:--\r\n\r\n    ‘Cardinal of York’s Memorial presented to Pope Clement 13th on\r\n    the absurdity of the See of Rome in refusing to acknowledge the\r\n    title of the Cardinal’s Brother (Charles Edward) to the Crown of\r\n    England on the death of their father in 1766.\r\n\r\n    ‘This paper was given me by my revered Relative, Dr. John Cooke,\r\n    President of C.C.C., who was at Rome at this time, and well known\r\n    to Cardinal York, tho’ a firm\r\n\r\nProtestant, in early life he was a friend to the legitimate\r\nSuccession.--It is not improbable that he copied this from the original\r\nmanuscript.\r\n\r\n    V. T.\r\n    ‘June 16, 1825.’\r\n\r\nA letter from the Hon. Charles Stewart, fellow of All Souls, afterwards\r\nthe Bishop of Quebec, to his brother, the eighth Earl of Galloway,\r\ndated Nov. 26th, 1825, explains that the initials on the endorsement\r\nare those of the Rev. Vaughan Thomas, at one time of Corpus Christi\r\nCollege, Oxford. Mr. Thomas desired that the manuscript should be given\r\nto Lord Galloway, whom he considered to be the proper person to possess\r\nso interesting a Stuart document.\r\n\r\n    MEMORIA\r\n\r\n    Sopra la necessità indispensabile, nella quale si trova la Santa\r\n    Sede di dover riconoscere per unici, e legittimi Successori del\r\n    Regno d’Inghilterra la Real Casa Stuarda, e sopra la Incoérenza\r\n    ed assurdi, che ne seguirebbero dal fare il contrario con poco\r\n    decoro della Santa Sedi Medesima.\r\n\r\n    Chi stende la memoria si dichiara di non voler aprire un libro\r\n    appoggiando i suoi Raziocinj su i fatti pubblici e notorj.\r\n\r\n    Niuno nel Mondo ignora qualmente il _Rè Giacomo_ Secondo fù\r\n    cacciato dal suo Regno unicamente _in odium Religionis_.\r\n    Gl’istissi Fanton della di lui espulsione erano i primi a non\r\n    mettere in controversia due principj infallibili. Il primo, che\r\n    il Regno d’Inghilterra era di sua natura successivo; Il Secondo\r\n    che la Real Persona di _Giacomo Secondo_ fosse il legittimo\r\n    Successore: Per ritrovare adunque un apparente pretesto di\r\n    cacciarnelo senza distruggere il diritto della successione che\r\n    secondo le leggi è inalterabile, per servire ai loro disegni\r\n    misero fuori le stabilimento già fatto per legge nel Regno della\r\n    Religione Anglicana; e piantando per Massima, che l’essere\r\n    il Rè Cattolico fosse un imminente e continuo péricolo della\r\n    distruzzione e sovversione di tal legge, fecero un Decreto di\r\n    Parlamento in cui pretendendo di Spiegare lo Spirito della legge\r\n    di successione dichiarono nel tempo stesso, che non potesse\r\n    essere atto a succedere chiunque fosse della Religione Cattolica\r\n    o ricusasse di conformassi alla Religione dominante.\r\n\r\n    In Virtù dunque di questo atto fù ingiustamente, ed iniquamente\r\n    cacciato _Giacomo Secondo_ e la sua prole cattolica dal suo regno\r\n    e chiamato a succedere il più prossimo erede Protestanti, il che\r\n    ha prosequito fino a dì nostri non solamente nelle Persone delle\r\n    due Figlie dell’ istisso _Giacomo Secondo_ per essere Protestanti\r\n    ma ancora nelle Persone dei Principi della casa d’Hannover, per\r\n    essere questi i più prossimi Eredi Protestanti; in prova di che\r\n    chiunque è ben informato delle Storie di Principi di questo\r\n    secolo, sà, che la _Principissa Anna_, da loro chiamata Regina,\r\n    volendo favorire _Giacomo terzo_ suo Fratello ad esclusione\r\n    della casa di Hannover _spedi persone accreditate per indurlo a\r\n    dichiararsi_ Protestante ed in questa maniera togliere l’unico\r\n    impedimento, che ostasse al possesso del di lui Regno, ma quella\r\n    medesima assistenza speciale di Dio, che diè forza a _Giacomo\r\n    Secondo_ suo Padre di Sagrificare trè Regni per la S. Fede, diè\r\n    altresi forza al di lui Figlio di ricusare corragiosamente si\r\n    fatta proposizione per ricuperarli.\r\n\r\n    Ciò presupposto è cosa indubitata, che anche a Giorni nostri\r\n    la S. Sede non canonizza niun trattato di Pace, a cui per\r\n    mezzo de’ suoi Ministri non intervenga, e molto meno approva\r\n    qualunque atto, che possa essere o direttamente o indirettamente\r\n    lesivo de’ suoi dritti e della S. Chiesa, il di cui Capo è il\r\n    Sommo Pontefice Vicario di Gesù Cristo; Anzi a Misure, che se\r\n    ne danno le occasioni, vi si fanno contro le dovute proteste.\r\n    Or’ chi può mettere in dubbio, o negare, che possa darsi un\r\n    Decreto pubblico più direttamente contrario alla nostra S.\r\n    Fede, e conseguentamente più lesivo dei dritti della S. Madre\r\n    Chiesa di quello di cui si tratta; per mezzo del quale viene\r\n    privato dei diritto della successione chiunque porta impresso il\r\n    fortunato carattere di essere di lei figliuolo. Quindi e che i\r\n    sommi Pontefici principiando da Innocenzo 11^o di Santa Memoria\r\n    giudicarono non essere uopo di fare alcuna esplicita protesta\r\n    contro di un si iniquo decreto servendosi e bastandogli in luogo\r\n    di questa il continuato riconoscimento, che ha fatto la S. Sede\r\n    della _Casa Reale Stuarda_ per gli unici e legittimi successori\r\n    del Regno, in consequenza di che veniva la S. Sede medesima a\r\n    risguardare per nullo il Decreto stesso che per indiretto e\r\n    tacitamente averebbe approvato sempre che soltanto negato avesse\r\n    ai legittimi Successori Cattolici il dovuto riconoscimento.\r\n\r\n    Ed infatti vi passa un gran divanò fra l’indispensabile\r\n    riconoscimento che far dee la S. Sede della _Real Casa Stuarda_,\r\n    ad esclusione di quella di Hanover da quel chepassa nel\r\n    riconoscimento almeno implicito, che fa la medesima S. Sede di\r\n    altri Principi Eretici. Per modo di esempio; il Papa certamente\r\n    nè tratta nè ha corrispondenza alcuna coi Rè di Svezia e di\r\n    Danimarca, ma ciò unicamente per essere Eglino Eretici, non già\r\n    perche loro impugno neghi la legittima successione dell’essere\r\n    di Rè; Quindi nei Diarj stessi stampati coll’ approvazione della\r\n    Corte di Roma, non si fa difficultà di enunciarli per Rè di\r\n    Svezia, per Rè di Danimarca; ma nel caso nostro non solo può il\r\n    sommo Pontefice trattare direttamente colla casa di Hanover per\r\n    essere Eretica, ma neppur può in alcun modo nè anche tacitamente\r\n    riconoscere il Capo di quella per legittimo successore del Regno\r\n    d’lnghilterra; Poiche verrebbe in tal guisa a canonizzare, ed\r\n    ammettere direttamente per valido e sussistente il sudetto inique\r\n    Decreto.\r\n\r\n    Di tutti questi fatti e principj si è Veduto dal mondo intero\r\n    a qual segno era persuasa ed imbevuta la S. Mem. di Clemente\r\n    undecimo il quale nell’atto di ricevere, e di abbracciare con\r\n    paterno amore la Maestà di _Giacomo terzo_, allorchi per suo\r\n    unico rifugio in virtù dei Frattati di Pace, ai quali tutti gli\r\n    altri Principi Cattolici, esclusone il sommo Pontefice, astretti\r\n    furono di acconsentire, si portò nello stato Ecclesiastico,\r\n    e successivamente a Roma: Persuaso, dico, il S. Padre ed\r\n    imbevuto delle sudette massime e sentimenti non si contentò di\r\n    riconoscere, e di trattare la Real Persona _di Giacomo terzo_\r\n    per unico e legittimo Rè d’lnghilterra, ma intendendo di volere\r\n    nella di lui Persona riconoscere tutta la Regia sua Prosapia,\r\n    non lasciò nè mezzi nè industrie per carcarne la propagazione\r\n    ed in consequenza procurargli un legittimo successore: Epperò\r\n    effettuato, che fù il matrimonio di _Giacomo terzo_ colla\r\n    Principessa Sobieskj; facilitato non poco da qualche Lettera del\r\n    Papa scritta all’ Imperadore: Frà pochi mesi divenne gravida\r\n    la Regina e circa gli ultimi giorni dell’ anno 1720 trovossi\r\n    prossima al parto; ed allora il S. Padre conoscendo da una parte\r\n    la necessità di dover rendere incontastabile la legitimazione\r\n    del Parto, e dall’ altra intendendo l’obligo preciso, in cui\r\n    ritrovasi la S. Sede, per non contradire a se stessa, e per vie\r\n    più sempre fare atti protestativi contro l’accennato ingiusto\r\n    Decreto, di riconoscere la futura prole qual Erede Presuntivo, e\r\n    legittimo successore del Regno d’Inghilterra si accensa a fare\r\n    questo atto colla maggiore solennità possibile; Perlocchi volle\r\n    il S. Padre, che fossero chiamate per essere presenti al parto,\r\n    il Sagro Collegio, il Senato Romano, i primi Prelati e Principi\r\n    Romani, e la primaria Nobilità di Roma; E Siccome la Maestà\r\n    della Regina stento a partorire per lo spazio di tre giorni in\r\n    circa in tutto questo tempo farono ripiene le Anticamere di\r\n    Sua Maestà dei riferti rispettabilissimi Personaggi, i quali\r\n    vicendevolmente surrogavansi gli uni agli altri, con avervi\r\n    ancora pernottato alcuni dei Signori Cardinali. In mezzo adunque\r\n    di consesso così rispettabile nacque _ai 31 di Dicembre dell’anno\r\n    Sudetto Carlo Odoardo Principe di Galles_ riconosciuto per tale e\r\n    consequentamente per Erede presuntivo della Corona dal Medesimo\r\n    sommo Pontefice, il quale non tardo punto a farlo annunziare a\r\n    tutto il Popolo per mezzo dello Sparo del Cannone di Castello. E\r\n    qui sia lecito riflettere che se il Rè Giacomo terzo stato fosse\r\n    in pacifico possesso del suo Trono, non poteva il sudetto nato\r\n    Principe ricevere maggiori onori, ed atti più declaratorj del\r\n    suo dritto successivo alla corona. La sola formalità, che per\r\n    parte della S. Sede rimanere poteva al compimento di questi atti\r\n    si era la tradizione _delle Fascie Benedette solite_ mandarsi ai\r\n    soli Eredi necessarj delle Teste Coronate, non già Elettive, ma\r\n    unicamenta successive: Ma perchi cessò di vivere la S. Memoria di\r\n    Clemente undecimo, prima che fossero del tutto terminate le dette\r\n    Fascie, toccò al di lui successore Innocenzo tredecimo compire\r\n    questo ultimo atto, com’ Egli fece colla maggior Solennità\r\n    possibile mandando a questo effetto preciso _un obligato_ con\r\n    tutte le formalità e ceremonie solite pratticarsi colle oltre\r\n    Corti.\r\n\r\n    Da tutto questo racconto non si può negare che appariscono nel\r\n    suo pieno le obligazioni che ha la _Real Casa Stuarda_ alla S.\r\n    Mem. di Clemente undecimo, ma appariscono altrettanto quanto\r\n    stava a cuore di quel sommo Pontefice il decoro della S. Sede\r\n    e come ben intendeva l’indispensabile necessità da cui era\r\n    astretta a Sostenere inviolabili i Dritti della Casa Reale\r\n    Sudetta: Videva benissimo il S. Padre, che tutti questi replicati\r\n    atti di riconoscimento dovevano necessariamente inasperire\r\n    il Governo d’Inghilterra massimamente contro i Cattolici ed\r\n    in conseguenza essere in qualche maniera di Ostacolo al buon\r\n    successo delle missioni; Capiva altrasi che egli solo era l’unico\r\n    Principe Cattolico, che faceva questi atti di riconoscimento:\r\n    con tutto ciò tenendo avanti gli Occhi la giustizia della\r\n    causa che diveniva punto di Religione, l’abborrimento che non\r\n    mai abbastanza poteva rimostrare la S. Sede al Sopracitato\r\n    Decreto, e per fine l’obbligo preciso de’ suoi Successori in\r\n    non dipartirsi giammai da quanto Egli faceva a prò di una\r\n    Famiglia si bene merita della S. Sede, non esitò punto di\r\n    eseguirli con tante Solennità, per mezzo delle quali toglieva a\r\n    Suoi Medesimi Successori qualunque ragione di dubbio circa il\r\n    trattamento dovuto al _Principe di Galles_, seguita la morte\r\n    del di lui Padre; Giacche sapeva benissimo il sommo Pontefice\r\n    che riconosciutosi una volta dalla S. Sede per Erede presuntivo\r\n    di un Regno un Figlio, non può mettere in dubbio alla morte\r\n    del di lui Padre, che gli Succeda in tutto, ed in conseguenza\r\n    nella sua dignita e ne’suoi onori; In quella guisa appunto, che\r\n    nell’ Impero (non ostante che sia stato elettivo) riconosciutosi\r\n    una volta dalla S. Sede alcuno Rè de’ Romani non può Ella\r\n    dispensarsi, Seguita la morte dell’ Imperadore, dal riconoscerlo\r\n    per di lui Successore.\r\n\r\n    Pieno pertanto il glorioso Clemente undecimo di questi\r\n    giustissimi sentimenti nell’ atto stesso di morire, volle\r\n    manifestare a tutto il sagro collegio qual si fosse la sua\r\n    premura perchè costantemente si mantenesse quanto Egli aveva\r\n    fatto verso la _Real Casa_, facendogli sù di ciò una speciale\r\n    raccomandazione. Fedelissimi e zelosissimi Esecutori delle\r\n    Operazioni e del Testamento di un tanto Papa sono Stati tutti i\r\n    Pontefici successori principiando da Innocenzo Tredecimo fino a\r\n    Clemente Tredecimo felicemente regnante, tutti hanno trattato\r\n    e risguardato il Figlio Primogenito di _Giacomo terzo_ come\r\n    _Principe di Galles_; cioè Successore del Regno d’Inghilterra.\r\n    Quindi dacchi il Principe cominciò ad essere ammesso all’ udienza\r\n    dei Sommi Pontefici non vi è stata mai la minima difficoltà circa\r\n    il trattamento, anzi non mettendosi in dubbio, che trà le altre\r\n    distinzioni competer gli dovesse _una sedia a braccio simile_ a\r\n    quella del Rè suo Padre; (il che è lo stile della S. Sede verso\r\n    gli Eredi presuntivi di un Regno). A questa sola particolarità\r\n    pregò la Maestà del Re, che si dovesse derogare in sua presenza\r\n    a solo ed unico fine mantenere lo stile del Regno d’Inghilterra,\r\n    che porta non possa ne anche il Figlio Primogenito sedere in\r\n    ugual sedia col Padre presente, e per aderire a queste brame\r\n    della Maestà sua gli è stata sempre data una sedia Camerale di\r\n    appoggio, ma bensì senza bracci.\r\n\r\n    Rimane ora ad esaminare le contradizzioni, ed assurdi, che ne\r\n    seguirebbero ogni qual volta la S. Sede negasse di riconoscere\r\n    il _Principe di Galles_ per legittimo successore del Rè suo\r\n    Padre alla morte di medesimo; Sarebbero questi fuor di dubbio\r\n    senza numero, nè si facile sarebbe l’accennarli tutti; pure\r\n    ne scorreremo alcuni. E Primieramente siccome il _Principe di\r\n    Galles_ per lo spazio ornai _di 45 anni e stato in possesso del\r\n    titolo_ e delle prerogative di Principe di Galles, non si gli\r\n    passono ora negare, o sia egli presente o sia assente, senza\r\n    derogare e contradire espressamente agli atti più solenni di sei\r\n    Papi consecutivi. In Secondo luogo ne seguirebbe, che quella\r\n    medesima, Persona, alla quale la S. Sede oggi dà trattamento e\r\n    risguarda come Principe di Galles (che vale a dire successore\r\n    naturale del Regno d’Inghilterra, come lo e il Delfino in\r\n    Francia, ed il Principe di Asturias in Spagna) domani verrendo\r\n    a morte del Padre, se si ricusa, quando Ella ne da parte, di\r\n    riconoscerla come succeduta al Padre medesimo nella dignità ed\r\n    onori col fatto si nega, che sia stato Principe di Galles. In\r\n    terzo luogo qual trattamento potrà darsi, morto il Padre, al\r\n    Sudetto Principe? Forse di Principe di Galles? Ma si avverta ch’\r\n    Egli non lo è più. Dunque o gli compete lo stesso trattamento\r\n    ch’ aveva il Padre a cui è succeduto, o converrà dire che non\r\n    gli competeva per tanti anni il titolo, e le prerogative di\r\n    Successore. Quarto, Affinche il Papa faccia una innovazione di\r\n    questa natura contradittoria ed opposto allo Stabilimento di suoi\r\n    Antecessori vi vuol qualche causa quale certamente non vi è ni\r\n    vi può essere; poichè se alcuno di Principi Cattolici sono stati\r\n    costretti a retrocedere dal riconoscere la _Real Casa Stuarda_\r\n    per legittimo Erede e Successore del Regno d’Inghilterra; è\r\n    avvenuto in consequenza dei diversi trattati di Pace col presente\r\n    Governo d’Inghilterra che li metteva in necessità di riconoscere\r\n    la Successione Eretica com’ era stata stabilita dal famoso\r\n    Decreto del Parlamento: Ma tal causa ogn’ un ben vede che non\r\n    può addursi dal S. Padre in alcun modo: Egli _non ha mai fatto,\r\n    nè puo fore trattati di alcuna sorta co’ Principi Eretici_;\r\n    Egli neppure ha aderito in questa parte ai sudetti trattati di\r\n    Pace di altri Principi: Sopra tutto Egli non hà potuto mai nè\r\n    può riconoscere per valido, o sussistente il famoso riferito\r\n    Decreto contro del quale, come si è accennato di Sopra, serve\r\n    d’incontrastabile protesta il continuato riconoscimento della\r\n    _Casa Reale Stuarda_. Anzi da qui verrebbe il quinto assurdo di\r\n    gravissimo pregiudizio alla S. Sede, e con ammirazione di tutti\r\n    i buoni, mentre cessando di riconoscere il _Principe di Galles_\r\n    come successore del _Rè suo Padre_, verrebbe il Papa in certa\r\n    maniera a rivocare tutte le proteste fatte da’ suoi Antecessori,\r\n    e _se ne inferirebbe una pregiudizievolissima_ consequenza; _Cioè\r\n    che quando in un stato Eretico il Principe si faccia Cattolico\r\n    sia in facoltà di Sudditi per questo solo motivo di escluderlo\r\n    dal Principato_. Sesto, che non vede l’assurdo gravissimo, che\r\n    ne succederebbe ne’ pubblichi Diarj stampati fin’ ora coll’\r\n    autorità della S. Seda sempre per lo spazio di tanti anni in\r\n    una stessa Maniera? Sotto il Titolo d’Inghilterra dovrà forse\r\n    Scriversi Giorgio Terzo? Ma questo non si può, mentre non vi ha\r\n    mai avuto luogo, ne può l’essere riconosciuto per Rè dal Papa.\r\n    Dovrà dunque lasciarsi sotto il sudetto titolo _Carlo Odoardo\r\n    Principe di Galles_--_Enrico Benedetto Duce di York_. Ma il\r\n    Padre dov è? Se egli è morto, non vi è più _Principe di Galles_.\r\n    Dunque questo Titolo non gli compete. Sicchè o bisogna indicarlo\r\n    per Rè o bisogna cassarlo, è cassare anzi per sempre il titolo\r\n    d’Inghilterra, come se più non vi fosse.\r\n\r\n    Rimane finalmente ad esaminare, se nelle circostanze presente\r\n    della S. Sede riconoscendo il Papa in caso di morte del Rè\r\n    _Giacomo Terzo_ il di lui figlio già per tanti anni in possesso\r\n    del titolo e delle prerogative di Principe di Galles per di\r\n    lui successore nelle dignità ed onori, possa a giusta ragione\r\n    ciò chiamarsi novità. Chi scrive si appella al mondo tutto, ai\r\n    nemici medesimi della casa Reale, ma già da questi stessi sente\r\n    replicarsi ad una voce, che sarebbe anzi novità per la S. Sede\r\n    fare il contrario, sarebbe contradizione a se stessa, sarebbe\r\n    approvare ciò che non può approvare, e per fine si usarebbe una\r\n    grandissima ostilità alla casa Reale in benemerenza di avere\r\n    sagrificati trè Regni per la S. Fede, privandola col fatto del\r\n    solo asilo, in cui possa risedere con decoro, e di cui è stata\r\n    in possesso per il decorso di tanti anni. Ne vi è certamente\r\n    Principe Cattolico che non conosca per tutti i motivi sopradetti\r\n    l’indispensabile necessità in cui trovasi la S. Sede di non\r\n    fare altrimenti, e capiscono tutti benissimo che niun Principe\r\n    è tenuto a render conto all’altro delle Operazioni, che Egli\r\n    fa, particolarmente quando sono conseguenze, e principj del\r\n    proprio Stato: Ed in effete non ostante che tutti i Principi\r\n    Cattolici in corpo abbiano ultimamente ricusato di riconoscere\r\n    il Rè di Polonia, ed il solo Papa con due Principi Eretici lo\r\n    abbiano riconosciuto: Quale però de’ Principi Cattolici ha fatto\r\n    mai querela sù di ciò al S. Padre, o facendola non fosse per\r\n    contentarsi di una si giusta risposta, qual sarebbe, che il Papa\r\n    non è obligato a render ragione delle sue operazione in alcune\r\n    circostanze; che in questo non ha fatto altro, che seguire le\r\n    massime, ed i principj della S. Sede: e finalmente, che a lui\r\n    basta, che gli costi della validità dell’ Elezione, e delle\r\n    dovute convenienze usate al suo nunzio, e per conseguenza alla\r\n    sua Persona?\r\n\r\n    Ma nel caso nostro sempre cresce l’argomento, poichè il\r\n    riconoscimento di un Rè di Polonia potrebbe ammettere qualch’\r\n    esame, o discussione, ma qual discussione o esame può mai\r\n    richiedersi nel riconoscere la legittima successione di un Figlio\r\n    al Padre dopo la sua morte nelle di lui prerogative ed onori?\r\n    Non è già questo riconoscimento come quello in realtà, atto\r\n    nuovo ma bensì una sola necessaria conseguenza di quello, che\r\n    già fù stabilito da tanti anni dai sommi Pontefici, allorchì\r\n    riconobbero il Figlio di _Giacomo Terzo_. E tutti gli argomenti,\r\n    che addurre si potrebbero, acciochè la S. Sede facesse una simil\r\n    novità di dispensarsi dal riconoscere il Principe di Galles\r\n    alla morte del di lui Genitore per suo legittimo successore,\r\n    potevano addursi, ed avevano anzi maggior forza per impedire il\r\n    riconoscimento del medesimo, in qualità di Principe di Galles\r\n    dalla S. Mem. di Clemente undecimo con tutte quelle circostanze\r\n    e solennità già riferite, mentre in quei tempi il Papa fù il\r\n    Solo Principe Cattolico, che riconobbe il Figlio di _Giacomo\r\n    Terzo_ per Principe di Galles. E quantunque la casa di Hanover\r\n    si avvedesse che questo atto fosse un impegno preso dalla S.\r\n    Sede (come certamente lo era) di doverlo in appresso riconoscere\r\n    per legittimo successore del Padre dopo la di lui morte, ciò non\r\n    ostante non apportò alcuno di quei cattivi effetti, forse ideati,\r\n    o tenuti da alcuna Persone poco informate e prattiche dello stato\r\n    delle cose in quel Regno.\r\n\r\n    Chi ha scritto questa memoria in ultimo si dichiara, che non\r\n    ha avuto altro scopo, che togliere i scrupoli di alcuni poco\r\n    intesi delle cose del mondo, e ribattere le difficoltà che forse\r\n    suscitar si potrebbe dai nemici non meno della Casa Reale,\r\n    che della S. Sede. Del resto i protesti veramente tenuti alle\r\n    continue dimostrazioni di Paterno amore, e clemenze usate dalla\r\n    Santità di nostro Signore felicemente regnante verso tutta la\r\n    sudetta casa Reale, che non può neppur sospettare, che mancando\r\n    a suoi tempi il _Rè Giacomo Terzo_ voglia punto deviare dalle\r\n    savissime traccie indicatigli da suoi gloriosi Antecessori.\r\n\r\n    _Nota_:--Siccome dopo stesa la presente memoria, pur troppo non\r\n    ha mancato più di uno di mettere in dubbio i sentimenti della\r\n    santità di nostro signore felicemente Regnante verso la Real\r\n    Casa, quasi che fossero totalmente diversi da quella de’suoi\r\n    antecessori, ed in conseguenza potersi supporre essere un\r\n    semplice complimento verso la Santità sua quel tanto che con\r\n    fiducia si viva presuppone l’Estensore nell’ ultimo della memoria\r\n    perciò lo stesso ha creduto uno preciso dovere di giustizia, ed\r\n    insiemi di gratitudine rispettosa verso li S. Padre d’inserire\r\n    in fine questa stessa memoria tutte le lettere, che possono aver\r\n    rapporto alla presente risoluzione presa dal Real Principe di\r\n    Galles di ritornare in questa Capitale; e siccome apparisce più\r\n    chiaro della luce del sole, quali siano i sentimenti precisi del\r\n    S. Padre verso la Real Casa, e la Persona del Real _Principe di\r\n    Galles_ sudetto tanto autenticamente manifestati, così lo stesso\r\n    Estensore crede non esservi bisogno di glossa per far conoscere\r\n    quanto siano insussistenti, e false le precorse assertive, e\r\n    con quanta ragione e fondamento abbia rimostrato l’Estensore\r\n    tutta la fiducia e sicurezza nei sentimenti della Santità sua e\r\n    quanto li abbia ben compresi il Real Principe di Galles, giacchè\r\n    unicamente in virtù de’ medesimi si è accinto alla risoluziona di\r\n    restituirsi a Roma.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Translation_[645]\r\n\r\n    Concerning the indispensable necessity of recognition, by\r\n    the Holy See, of the Royal House of Stuart, as the sole and\r\n    legitimate successors to the Kingdom of England, and concerning\r\n    the inconsistencies and incongruities which would ensue, should\r\n    she follow the contrary course, being one which would little\r\n    become the dignity of the Holy See.\r\n\r\n    He who presents this Memorial wishes to state the case briefly,\r\n    basing his reasonings on public and well-known facts. No one\r\n    in the world is ignorant of the fact that _King James II._ was\r\n    hunted from his throne _in odium Religionis_. The very people who\r\n    were scheming for his expulsion would have been the last to deny\r\n    two infallible principles. The first--that the Kingdom of England\r\n    was, of its nature, an hereditary one; the second, that the Royal\r\n    Person of _James II._ was the lawful successor. Wishing therefore\r\n    to find an adequate pretext for deposing him, without destroying\r\n    the right of succession, which is, by law, unalterable, they,\r\n    to serve their own ends, brought forward the question of the\r\n    establishment in the kingdom, already made by law, of the\r\n    Anglican Religion; and making as their chief complaint, that the\r\n    fact of the king being a Catholic placed that law in constant\r\n    and imminent peril of destruction and subversion, they made an\r\n    Act of Parliament in which, while claiming to explain the spirit\r\n    of the laws of succession, they declared at the same time that\r\n    it was not fitting that any one whosoever should succeed who was\r\n    of the Catholic Religion, or who did not conform to the dominant\r\n    religion.\r\n\r\n    By virtue of this Act, then, were _James II._ and his Catholic\r\n    offspring deprived of the throne, and his nearest Protestant\r\n    relative was called to succeed to it, whose line has continued\r\n    to do so even to our own days, not only in the persons of James\r\n    II.’s two daughters, who were Protestants, but also in those of\r\n    the Princes of the House of Hanover, these being the nearest\r\n    Protestant heirs; in proof of this, any one who has knowledge\r\n    of the history of the princes of this century knows that the\r\n    _Princess Anne_, called by them Queen, wishing to show favour\r\n    to her brother _James III._, to the exclusion of the House of\r\n    Hanover, _sent accredited persons to try to persuade him to\r\n    declare himself a Protestant_, and to remove, in this manner,\r\n    the only obstacle that stood in the way of his possession of his\r\n    kingdom: but that special grace of God, which gave strength to\r\n    his father, _James II._, to sacrifice three kingdoms for the Holy\r\n    Faith, likewise gave strength to his son to refuse courageously\r\n    any such means of regaining them.\r\n\r\n    This, one may take for granted, is an undoubted fact, that then,\r\n    as now, the Holy See is bound by no Treaty of Peace, in the\r\n    arranging of which, by means of her Ministers, she has had no\r\n    voice, and how much less does she approve of any act that can,\r\n    either directly or indirectly, infringe on her rights and those\r\n    of Holy Church, the head of whom is the Supreme Pontiff, the\r\n    Vicar of Christ: rather should such arise she would make fitting\r\n    protests.\r\n\r\n    Now can it be questioned that any public decree could be more\r\n    directly contrary to our Holy Faith, and consequently could\r\n    infringe more seriously on the rights of Holy Mother Church,\r\n    than that of which we are treating, by means of which the rights\r\n    of Succession are denied to any one happy enough to be one of\r\n    her sons? Hence it is that the Supreme Pontiffs, beginning with\r\n    Innocent XI. of pious memory, did not deem it necessary to\r\n    make any explicit protest against such an iniquitous decree,\r\n    contenting themselves instead with the continued recognition\r\n    which the Holy See has always accorded to the _Royal House of\r\n    Stuart_, as the sole and legitimate successors to the throne,\r\n    so that the Holy See came to regard this Decree (to which, had\r\n    she refused to recognise the legitimate Catholic successors, she\r\n    would have been indirectly and tacitly agreeing,) as null.\r\n\r\n    And indeed, there is a great comparison to be drawn between\r\n    the recognition given by the Holy See to the _Royal House of\r\n    Stuart_, to the exclusion of the House of Hanover, and that\r\n    which this same Holy See accords to other heretical princes;\r\n    as, for example, the Pope certainly is in no treaty, and has no\r\n    correspondence with the Kings of Sweden and Denmark, but this\r\n    is solely because they are heretics, not because he denies in\r\n    any way their legitimate right to their succession. Thus, in the\r\n    papers printed with the approbation of the Court of Rome, no\r\n    difficulty is raised as to speaking of them as King of Sweden and\r\n    King of Denmark; but in the case in point, the Most High Pontiff\r\n    treats directly with this heretical House of Hanover, though\r\n    he cannot by any means recognise its head as the legitimate\r\n    successor to the Kingdom of England, so that in this manner he is\r\n    ratifying the aforesaid iniquitous decree, and directly admitting\r\n    it as valid and real.\r\n\r\n    It is plainly seen by the whole world how deeply imbued with\r\n    these facts and principles was Clement XI. of blessed memory,\r\n    who, when His Majesty _King James III._ turned to him as his\r\n    only refuge (on account of the Treaty of Peace, to which all\r\n    the Catholic princes, with the exception of His Holiness, were\r\n    constrained to consent), carried him away to the Papal States,\r\n    and afterwards to Rome: the Holy Father, I say, fully imbued\r\n    with and convinced of the aforesaid sentiments and truth, did\r\n    not content himself with simply recognising and treating the\r\n    royal person of _James III._ as the sole and legitimate King of\r\n    England, but, wishing to recognise also all his royal progeny,\r\n    he spared no trouble to ensure that the propagation of the\r\n    line should be carried on, in order to procure him a legitimate\r\n    successor. This was effected by the marriage of _James III._ with\r\n    the Princess Sobieski; which was not a little facilitated by\r\n    letters written by the Pope to the Emperor. In a few months it\r\n    became known that the hopes for an heir were to be realised, and\r\n    towards the last days of the year 1720, as the time of his birth\r\n    approached, the Holy Father knowing on the one side the necessity\r\n    of rendering the legitimacy of the birth indisputable, and on\r\n    the other, realising that the Holy See must in nowise contradict\r\n    herself, but must act in such a manner as to show most decidedly\r\n    her protest against the unjust Decree, by recognising the future\r\n    offspring as heir-apparent and legitimate successor to the throne\r\n    of England, he took upon himself to see that this event should\r\n    take place with the greatest possible solemnity; and therefore,\r\n    by the wish of the Holy Father, there were called to be present\r\n    at the birth, the Sacred College, the Roman Senate, the highest\r\n    Roman Princes and Prelates, and the foremost nobility of Rome;\r\n    and although there was a delay of three days before the birth\r\n    took place, during the whole of this time the ante-rooms of Her\r\n    Majesty were filled with these most venerable personages, who\r\n    relieved one another by turns, while some of the Cardinals sat\r\n    up each night. Thus, in the midst of so honourable an assembly\r\n    was born _on December 31st of the aforesaid year, Charles Edward,\r\n    Prince of Wales_, acknowledged as such, and consequently as\r\n    heir-apparent to the Crown, by the Supreme Pontiff himself,\r\n    who without delay had the birth announced to all the people by\r\n    means of a salute from the cannon of the castle. And here it is\r\n    allowable to reflect that even had _King James III._ been in\r\n    peaceful possession of his throne the aforesaid newly-born Prince\r\n    could not have received greater honours, nor could his right to\r\n    succeed to the Crown have been proclaimed more unquestionably.\r\n    The only formality which could have put a finishing touch to the\r\n    rest was the traditional _Delivery of the Swaddling Clothes_,\r\n    which it was the custom to send only to the heirs of crowned\r\n    heads (and then only to those reigning by succession, not by\r\n    election): but, as Clement XI. of pious memory died before this\r\n    matter was concluded, it fell to his successor, Innocent XIII.,\r\n    to complete it, which he did with all possible solemnity, sending\r\n    an ambassador, with all the formality and ceremonies observed\r\n    with other Courts.\r\n\r\n    From all this, it cannot be denied that the obligations under\r\n    which the _Royal House of Stuart_ lay to Clement XI. of blessed\r\n    memory are very plainly shown, but it is also shown just as\r\n    plainly how much His Holiness had at heart the dignity of the\r\n    Holy See, and how well he realised the absolute necessity by\r\n    which he was bound to sustain the rights of the aforesaid\r\n    Royal House inviolable. The Holy Father saw plainly that all\r\n    these repeated acts of recognition must necessarily greatly\r\n    embitter the English Government against the Catholics, and, in\r\n    consequence, must, in a manner, be an obstacle to the success\r\n    of the missions. He also understood that he alone was the one\r\n    Catholic prince who had made this act of recognition. With\r\n    all this, keeping before his eyes the justice of the cause\r\n    (which was quite apart from the question of religion), the\r\n    abhorrence that the Holy See could never sufficiently show to the\r\n    aforementioned decree, and, finally, the strict obligation of his\r\n    successors never to depart from the line he had taken towards\r\n    a family which deserved so much from the Holy See, he did not\r\n    hesitate for a moment to pursue this course with great solemnity,\r\n    thereby robbing his successors of any reason of doubt concerning\r\n    the treatment owed to the _Prince of Wales_ on the death of\r\n    his father; since His Holiness knew well, that once a son was\r\n    recognised as heir-apparent by the Holy See, no doubt could be\r\n    raised that at the death of his father he should succeed to\r\n    everything, and therefore to his dignity and honours: in the same\r\n    way that, in the Empire (notwithstanding its being an Elective\r\n    State), once the Holy See recognised any one as King of the\r\n    Romans, she could not afterwards, on the death of the Emperor,\r\n    free herself from recognising his successor. The mind of the\r\n    glorious Clement XI. was so full of these just sentiments, at the\r\n    moment of his death, that he wished to show plainly to all the\r\n    Sacred College how great was his anxiety that what he had done\r\n    towards the Royal House should be permanently maintained, laying\r\n    on them a special charge to that effect. All the succeeding\r\n    Popes, beginning with Innocent XIII. down to Clement XIII., now\r\n    by the grace of God reigning, have been most faithful and zealous\r\n    executors of this trust, and all have treated and regarded the\r\n    first-born son of _James III._ as _Prince of Wales_; therefore as\r\n    successor to the King of England. Hence, ever since the Prince\r\n    has been admitted to audiences with His Supreme Holiness, there\r\n    has never been the slightest difficulty as to his treatment,\r\n    or rather, there has been no doubt, that among other fitting\r\n    distinctions, he should have, as did the king, his father, an\r\n    armchair (which it is customary for the Holy See to offer to the\r\n    heirs-apparent to a throne). But, in this one particular, His\r\n    Majesty asked that a slight modification might be made in his\r\n    presence, for the one and only reason of maintaining the custom\r\n    of the Kingdom of England, where even the eldest son in the\r\n    presence of his father is not allowed to sit in a seat equal to\r\n    his: and to comply with His Majesty’s wish, the prince has always\r\n    been given an easy chair, but without arms.\r\n\r\n    There now remains to examine the contradictions and\r\n    inconsistencies which would arise each time that the Holy\r\n    See refused to recognise the _Prince of Wales_ as legitimate\r\n    successor to the king, his father, at the death of the latter.\r\n    These would be without doubt innumerable; it would not be easy to\r\n    foresee them all, nevertheless we can mention some. Firstly, that\r\n    as the _Prince of Wales_ has for the space of _forty-five years\r\n    been in possession of the title_ and prerogatives of Prince of\r\n    Wales, they cannot now be denied him, whether present or absent,\r\n    without derogating and expressly contradicting the solemn line\r\n    of action followed by six successive Popes. In the second place,\r\n    it must follow that if the Holy See to-day treats and looks on\r\n    this same person as _Prince of Wales_ (that is to say, as natural\r\n    successor to the throne of England, as is the Dauphin to that of\r\n    France, and the Prince of the Asturias to that of Spain), and\r\n    to-morrow hearing of the death of his father draw back from\r\n    recognising him as succeeding to that father in dignity and\r\n    honours, she thus denies that he ever was Prince of Wales. In the\r\n    third place, how could she then recognise the aforesaid Prince\r\n    after his father’s death? Perhaps still as Prince of Wales? But\r\n    it is averred that he is that no longer. Plainly then, either he\r\n    is entitled to the same treatment as that given to his father,\r\n    whom he has succeeded, or, it is only right to say that he has\r\n    not been entitled all these years to the prerogatives and rights\r\n    of heir. Fourthly, before the Pope could make an innovation of\r\n    this nature, so entirely at variance with the course adopted\r\n    by his predecessors, it would be necessary to have some very\r\n    strong reason, which neither exists now, nor ever can exist.\r\n    For, if any of the Catholic princes have been constrained to\r\n    draw back from the recognition of the _Royal House of Stuart_,\r\n    as legitimate successors and heirs to the throne of England,\r\n    it has only been in consequence of their entering on different\r\n    treaties of peace with the present Government of England, which\r\n    has put them under the necessity of recognising the heretical\r\n    succession, as established by the famous Act of Parliament.\r\n    But no such cause can possibly affect the Holy Father in any\r\n    way. _He has never made nor can he make treaties of any sort\r\n    with heretical Princes_: neither has he ever taken part in the\r\n    aforesaid treaties of peace of other princes. Above all, he never\r\n    has recognised, nor can he ever recognise, as valid or real, this\r\n    same famous Decree, against which, as has been shown above, the\r\n    continued recognition of the _Royal House of Stuart_ serves as an\r\n    indisputable protest. And from this we come to the fifth serious\r\n    inconsistency, which might be most prejudicial to the Holy See;\r\n    for if the Pope should cease to recognise the _Prince of Wales_\r\n    as successor to the _king, his father_, it is evident, even to\r\n    his most humble admirers, that he would be, in a way, revoking\r\n    all the protests made by his predecessors, _and a very dangerous\r\n    consequence might ensue_: namely, _that should the prince of any\r\n    heretical state become a Catholic, it would be within the power\r\n    of his subjects, for this one reason only, to deprive him of his\r\n    rights and inheritances_.\r\n\r\n    Sixthly, is it not easy to see the serious inconsistency that\r\n    would arise in the Public Records, which, up till now, have,\r\n    with the authority of the Holy See, been printed for so many\r\n    years in the same manner? Under the heading of England should\r\n    there then be inscribed the name of _George III_? But this is\r\n    not possible, since he has never been, nor can be recognised by\r\n    the Pope as king. Should there not rather be entered under the\r\n    above heading--_Charles Edward, Prince of Wales--Henry Benedict,\r\n    Duke of York_? But where is the father? If he is dead there is\r\n    no longer a _Prince of Wales_, then this title does not belong\r\n    to him. Either the title should be that of king, or it should be\r\n    abolished, with that of England, as if it no longer existed.\r\n\r\n    It only remains then to examine whether in the circumstances\r\n    in which the Holy See is now placed, the Papal recognition (as\r\n    in the occasion of the death of _King James III._) of the son\r\n    who has been for so many years in possession of the titles and\r\n    prerogatives of the _Prince of Wales_, as successor in dignity\r\n    and honours, can, in any justice be called an innovation. He who\r\n    writes appeals to the whole world, even to the enemies of the\r\n    Royal House, though even these he can hear declaring as with one\r\n    voice that the innovation would rather be, that the Holy See\r\n    should act to the contrary; it would be a self-contradiction, in\r\n    that it would be showing approbation of that of which she does\r\n    not approve, and further, it would be showing great hostility\r\n    to the Royal House in return for its having sacrificed three\r\n    kingdoms for the Holy Faith, in depriving it of the only refuge\r\n    to which it can rightly turn, and in which it has trusted for so\r\n    many years. And there is no Catholic prince who does not well\r\n    understand how impossible it would be for the Pope to follow\r\n    such a course. They know well that no prince is called upon to\r\n    account for his doings to any one else, more particularly when\r\n    they concern matters or principles relating to his own state. And\r\n    indeed, notwithstanding that all the Catholic princes in a body\r\n    have lately refused to recognise the King of Poland, and only\r\n    the Pope, with two heretical princes have done so, the Catholic\r\n    princes, have, in this action of the Holy Father found no cause\r\n    of quarrel, or, if they have found any, they have been satisfied\r\n    with the just remark, that the Pope is not obliged to give any\r\n    reasons for his actions under any circumstances, and that, in\r\n    this case, he has only followed the rules and principles of the\r\n    Holy See, and lastly that it is sufficient for him that he is\r\n    satisfied with the validity of the election, and of the treatment\r\n    accorded to his ambassador, as representing his own person.\r\n\r\n    But in our case, this only strengthens the argument, in that the\r\n    recognition of the King of Poland admitted of some inquiries\r\n    and discussion, but what discussion or inquiry can be necessary\r\n    in recognising the legitimate succession of a son to a father,\r\n    after the death of the latter? In reality there is no comparison\r\n    between the two cases, this last recognition being nothing new,\r\n    but rather the necessary consequence of the understanding that\r\n    was established years ago by the supreme Pontiffs, that they\r\n    should recognise the son of _James III._\r\n\r\n    And all the arguments that could be cited, in order that the\r\n    Holy See should give herself a dispensation from now recognising\r\n    the Prince of Wales as legitimate successor on the death of his\r\n    father, might have been brought forward just as reasonably,\r\n    and with greater force, to hinder Clement XI. of pious memory\r\n    from recognising him as Prince of Wales, as he did with all\r\n    ceremony, as has already been stated, being at that time the\r\n    only Catholic prince who did so recognise him. And although the\r\n    House of Hanover saw that this act constituted a promise from\r\n    the Holy See, which it certainly did, to recognise the prince\r\n    as legitimate successor of his father, after the death of the\r\n    latter, this, notwithstanding, brought none of those evil effects\r\n    (perhaps chimerical) which were feared by some people who were\r\n    but ill-informed or little conversant with the state of affairs\r\n    in the kingdom.\r\n\r\n    He who has written this Memorial would have it understood in\r\n    conclusion, that he has no other aim in view than to remove\r\n    scruples felt by some who know little of the affairs of the\r\n    world, and to combat the difficulties that perhaps might be\r\n    raised by enemies, not only of the Royal House, but of the Holy\r\n    See. For the rest, there has ever been such continual clemency\r\n    and fatherly love shown by His Holiness, now by the grace of God\r\n    reigning, towards the whole of the aforesaid Royal House that it\r\n    is impossible to believe, on the death of King James III., that\r\n    His Holiness will in any way depart from the most wise example\r\n    set by his predecessors of glorious memory.\r\n\r\n    NOTE:--As, after the completion of this Memorial there were not\r\n    lacking those who cast doubts on the sentiments of His Holiness,\r\n    now by the grace of God reigning, towards the Royal House,\r\n    suspecting that they differed from those of his predecessors,\r\n    and who, therefore, might consider the lively confidence evinced\r\n    by the writer in the latter part of this Memorial simply as an\r\n    empty compliment towards His Holiness, this same writer has\r\n    therefore considered it a strict act of justice, as well as a\r\n    tribute of gratitude and respect, towards the Holy Father, to\r\n    insert at the end of this Memorial any letters that bear upon the\r\n    present resolution of the Royal Prince of Wales to return to this\r\n    capital. And as the exact sentiments of the Holy Father towards\r\n    the Royal House and the person of the said _Prince of Wales_ have\r\n    been shown more unquestionably clearly than the light of the sun,\r\n    so the writer considers any further comments and explanations\r\n    unnecessary, to show how unfounded and false these suspicions\r\n    are, and with how much reason and foundation the writer has\r\n    relied so surely on the sentiments of the Holy Father, and how\r\n    well the Royal Prince of Wales has understood them, in that it\r\n    is solely on the strength of the same, that he continues in his\r\n    resolve to return to Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VI\r\n\r\nTHE MACDONALDS\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn, Lord of the Isles (died 1387), fourth in succession from Donald\r\nprogenitor of the clan, had two wives: (1) Amy MacRuari; (2) the\r\nPrincess Margaret, daughter of Robert II., to marry whom he repudiated\r\nor divorced Amy. The lordship of the Isles went to the descendants of\r\nthe Princess. The hereditary clan chiefship, which ordinarily descends\r\nto the senior heir-male, did not necessarily follow the title. The\r\nlordship of the Isles was taken from the Macdonalds and annexed to\r\nthe Crown in 1494, and the question who is supreme hereditary chief\r\nof Clan Donald has ever since been a matter of strife. Glengarry and\r\nClanranald descend from Amy MacRuari, the first wife, and are therefore\r\nsenior in blood, but it is doubtful which of these two families is the\r\nelder; last century the general preference was for Glengarry, but the\r\nnew _Scots Peerage_ and the Clan Donald historian favour Clanranald.\r\nSleat and Keppoch descend from the Princess Margaret, Sleat coming\r\nfrom Hugh, third son of Alexander, Lord of the Isles (died 1449),\r\ngrandson of John, and son of Donald of Harlaw, while Keppoch comes\r\nfrom the fourth son of John and Princess Margaret, and could only have\r\na claim if there were a flaw in the pedigree of Sleat. Doubts have\r\nbeen expressed of the legitimacy of Hugh of Sleat, but these have been\r\nset aside. Glencoe’s progenitor was Ian, son of Angus Og (died 1330),\r\nBruce’s friend who fought at Bannockburn, the father of John, Lord of\r\nthe Isles, mentioned above, but the Seannachies have pronounced him\r\nillegitimate. From this Ian the Glencoe clan has been known as MacIan\r\nfor centuries.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to know that in the summer of 1911, the three\r\nhereditary heads of the families having serious claims on the supreme\r\nchiefship of the clan, Glengarry, Clanranald, and Sleat (Sir Alexander\r\nof the Isles), signed an indenture mutually agreeing to cease from\r\nactive assertion of their claims, and that in the event of more than\r\none of them being present with the clan, precedence for the occasion\r\nwould be decided by lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VII\r\n\r\nGENEALOGICAL TABLES SHOWING THE KINSHIP OF CERTAIN HIGHLAND CHIEFS AND\r\nLEADERS IN 1745.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 SIR RODERICK MACLEOD, 13TH OF DUNVEGAN, d. 1626,\r\n                 m.

Jonathan was the last of the Urquharts who owned the estate\r\nof Cromarty, famous owing to its possession by Sir Thomas Urquhart, the\r\ntranslator of Rabelais. Jonathan’s affairs having got into disorder,\r\nhe sold his ancestral property to George Mackenzie, Viscount Tarbat,\r\nwho was created Earl of Cromartie in 1703. James Urquhart married Anne\r\nRollo, daughter of Robert Rollo of Powhouse, and had an only child,\r\nGrizel, who died unmarried. Colonel Urquhart ‘was a man of noble\r\nspirit, great honour, and integrity; he served in the wars both in\r\nSpain and Flanders with great reputation, but left the Army, and lived\r\na retired life.... In him ended the whole male line of John, only son\r\nof the first marriage of John, tutor of Cromarty ... the representation\r\ndevolved upon William Urquhart of Meldrum’ (Douglas, _Baronage_).\r\nColonel Urquhart was born in 1691, and died on January 3rd, 1741\r\n(Family papers). His appointment as Jacobite Agent for Scotland is\r\ndated May 28th, 1736 (Ruvigny, _Jacobite Peerage_, p. 234).\r\n\r\n[19] Not the famous conqueror of Almanza, who was killed in the War of\r\nthe Polish Succession when besieging Philipsburg, on June 28th, 1734,\r\nbut his son, known until then as the Duke of Liria.\r\n\r\n[20] His commission as colonel is dated October 22nd, 1715.--Ruvigny,\r\n_Jacobite Peerage_, p. 244.\r\n\r\n[21] For general information about Gordon of Glenbucket, the reader is\r\nreferred to Mr. J. M. Bulloch’s monumental work, _The House of Gordon_\r\n(New Spalding Club, Aberdeen, 1912). For Glenbucket’s character and his\r\nactions in 1745, see _infra_, p. 113 _et seq._ It is remarkable how the\r\ndesignation ‘of Glenbucket’ has adhered to the family for generations,\r\nalthough the land from which it was derived was parted with a hundred\r\nand seventy-nine years ago. Gordon’s descendants are still tenants of\r\nthe farm of St. Bridget’s, in Glenlivet, which was old Glenbucket’s\r\nhome in 1745, and are still termed ‘Glenbucket’ in the district.\r\nFor the Macdonell marriages see the genealogies in _History of Clan\r\nDonald_, vol. iii.\r\n\r\n[22] M. Haile, _James Francis Edward_, p. 367.\r\n\r\n[23] French historians generally blame Fleury for his timidity, and\r\nascribe to him the decline of the splendid French navy, which he\r\nallowed to fall into decay for fear of English jealousy.\r\n\r\n[24] The commission is dated January 28th, 1738.

Lord John Drummond, who was\r\nbrother-in-law of Traquair, remained inactive. Prince Charles spent the\r\nnight of February 2nd, 1746, at his house, Fairnton, now Ferntower,\r\nnear Crieff. Lord Traquair remained in England; he was arrested at\r\nGreat Stoughton in Huntingdonshire, on July 29th, 1746, and committed\r\nto the Tower; but was released without trial before August 1748.\r\nTraquair’s brother, John Stuart, married in 1740 and retired from the\r\nConcert then. Sir James Campbell was too old for action. Macgregor of\r\nBalhaldies was in Paris during the campaign.\r\n\r\n[32] The name ‘Macgregor’ was then proscribed, and all members of the\r\nclan had to adopt another name; that adopted by Balhaldy’s branch\r\nwas ‘Drummond.’ Balhaldy’s father, Alexander, was a man of some\r\nconsequence. He had been a trader about Stirling, and made some money,\r\nand he married a daughter of Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel, his son\r\nBalhaldy being thus a first cousin of Lochiel of the ’45. In 1714 the\r\nClan Gregor being chiefless, certain of its leading members elected\r\nAlexander to be hereditary chief. (A. G. M. Macgregor, _Hist. of Clan\r\nGregor_, vol. ii. p. 270.) He was created a Scots baronet by the\r\nChevalier in 1740, and he died at Balhaldie House, Dunblane, in 1749.\r\nHis son, William, was born in 1698. Though never in Scotland after\r\n1743 he was attainted in 1746, and specially exempted from the act of\r\nindemnity of 1747. He married Janet, daughter of Laurence Oliphant of\r\nGask, at Paris in January 1758. He died near Paris in 1765.\r\n\r\n[33] The designation Balhaldy is spelt variously in contemporary\r\ndocuments, Bohaldy, Bochaldie, Bahady, etc. Cf. R. L.

(See _post_, p. 22.)\r\n\r\n[132] This thought was the least reason could assign to Mr. Amalot\r\nfor my coming over, as I could not tell him it was owing to a letter\r\nwe had received from Mr. D[rummond], which I have repented of since,\r\nfor I told him if he was instructed by the Cardinal, as they said, he\r\ncertainly would have let me see that these Gentlemen had no reason to\r\ngive such encouragements, which would have at once shewed them in their\r\nTrue Light. This Mr. Drummond and Lord Semple insisted I should say to\r\nexcite the French to Action and I then did not think it any great crime\r\nto use them as they had often done us by imposing upon them.\r\n\r\n[133] I shall leave it to the Reader to determine how far this answer\r\nof Mr. Amelot agrees with what Mr. D[rummond] advances in his Letter\r\nand if it be at all reasonable to imagine that the Cardinal had\r\nresolved upon an Invasion when the person he had employed in this\r\naffair had never read the Memorial given in concerning it nor even\r\nunderstood the manner in which it was concerted and carried on in\r\nScotland and again whether or not Lord Semple had succeeded as he\r\nbraged in preventing much delay by perswading the Cardinal to make Mr.\r\nAmelot privy to the whole affair.\r\n\r\n[134] I mentioned before that the King had ordered a Sum not exceeding\r\n£900 Ster yearly to be payed to Sir J[ames] C[ampbell] provided\r\nmoney could be raised he had hitherto gott no more than £200 Lord\r\nT[ra]q[uai]r had payed him so I was instructed to know why it was not\r\nanswered as promised, which I accordingly did, when Mr. Drummond said\r\nhe thought it very odd that the people in Scotland could not give him\r\nthat small pension when Lord T[ra]q[uai]r had offered Lord Semple\r\ncredit for £1,000 the year before when in London. I told him people\r\nhad little money to spare and that since the Gentlemen was in a manner\r\nstarving I would write to the King about it as directed, upon which he\r\nsaid in a passion I had better not do it for it would hurt them in the\r\nKing’s Eyes as it must look bad that people who profered doing so much\r\ncould not advance such a trifle, and I remember he said the King would\r\nnot fail to look upon them as tamperers which I never did mention to\r\nthem looking upon it as the heat of passion. He then said as he had\r\nall along made it his Business to advance their Interest and Honour,\r\nhe would fall upon a method of raising a sum of money to the Value of\r\n5 or 6,000£ upon a bond payable at the Restoration with six per cent.\r\nof Interest and that D[uke of] P[erth] L[ord] T[ra]q[uai]r L[ochie]l\r\nand I should bind for it and that he would even endeavour to gett an\r\nequall sum for D[uke of] P[erth] on L[ord] T[ra]q[uai]r’s particular\r\nUse upon the same Conditions. As I then did not know my man I went on\r\nto what he proposed and did not write to the King about it, neither did\r\nI till after I found out the double fetch he had in it, he at this time\r\nwas applying to have a Pension settled upon himself which my writing\r\nin behalf of Sir J[ames] C[ampbell] would certainly have prevented as\r\nthe King had ordered him to stay at home in the view of receiving the\r\nforementioned Sum, then his proposing to raise this sum for the D[uke]\r\nof P[erth]’s use was a means to encourage him to advance him £100,\r\nwhich he desired I would tell his Grace he would draw upon him at my\r\nleaving London, which he accordingly gott.\r\n\r\n[135] During all the time I was at London after my return from Paris\r\nI keept it secret from Coll. Cicel and Mr. Smith that I had ever been\r\nthere, and gave it out that I had been in Kent making a visit to one\r\nDoctor Rutton, an old fellow student at Leyden, so upon the footing\r\nof my not knowing anything that was passing I told Coll. Cicel in\r\nConversation upon my return to Scotland the King’s friends would\r\ninquire of me if I had not been to waite of him and what news I had\r\ngott so begg to know what I should say, he told me he at that time\r\ncould say nothing positively but if the French did not do something\r\nsoon the affairs of England in particular and Europe in general stood\r\nin such a way that in three moneth time he would order affairs so as\r\nto call the King over with his own attendance only this Vaunt was so\r\nrediculous that I had great difficulty to keep my Countinance and gave\r\nme a very low Opinion of every other thing he said.\r\n\r\n[136] One evening after I had waited an hour in L[ord] T[ra]q[uai]r’s\r\nlodgings at Edinburgh till such time as he should come in to talk with\r\nme about his journey to London he told me he understood that I was no\r\nfriend to Bishop Keith, and upon asking what ground he had to think\r\nso, he told me that one Mr. Gordon, a Roman Catholick Bishop, had\r\ninformed him of it, it seems Bishop Keith was of his acquaintance had\r\nbeen complaining to him that I had not represented him in a favourable\r\nLight. By which I conjectured that Keith had been applying that way\r\nto be named Bishop of Edinburgh for how should L[ord] J[ohn] Drummond\r\nhave acquainted Lady Clanronald of Mr. Rattrae’s being named, which\r\nwas a thing entirely foreign to both him and her if Keith had not been\r\nendeavouring to procure that preferment through the interest of the\r\nRoman Catholicks,[649] and Lord Drummond did write to Lady Clanronald\r\nthat I had procured an order for Bishop Rattrae’s Election is certain,\r\nfor it was by her means quite well known in Edinburgh before I came\r\nback from London and Lord T[ra]q[uai]r assured me from Bishop Gordon\r\nthat L[ord] J[ohn] had wrote it to Lady Clanranald.\r\n\r\n[137] My Lord T[ra]q[uai]r made all the dispatch possible to settle his\r\naffairs at home, being sensible how necessary it was for him to be att\r\nLondon and sett out from his own house on the sixth of Aprile.\r\n\r\n[138] For this ecclesiastical episode in Murray’s career, see Appendix.\r\n\r\n[139] Thomas Rattray, D.D., laird of Craighall-Rattray, Perthshire.\r\nBorn 1684; consecrated bishop at large, 1727; afterwards Bishop of\r\nBrechin, and subsequently of Dunkeld; Primus, 1739; died 1743.\r\n\r\n[140] See Introduction, p. xxiii.\r\n\r\n[141] Thomas Cochrane; 6th earl; died 1737.\r\n\r\n[142] Robert Freebairn, consecrated bishop at large, 1722; Primus,\r\n1731; Bishop of Edinburgh, 1733; died 1739.\r\n\r\n[143] Drumelzier, a Peebleshire estate adjoining Broughton. The\r\nproprietor was then Alexander Hay of Drumelzier, and Whittinghame,\r\nEast Lothian (the latter now the property of Rt. Hon. A. J. Balfour);\r\na grandson of the 1st Earl of Tweeddale, ancestor of the Hays of Duns:\r\nborn 1701; died 1789. He and his brother William were both Jacobites.\r\n\r\n[144] I think there can be little doubt that this is the draft of\r\nthe lost letter searched for in vain by Mr. Fitzroy Bell at Windsor\r\n(_Murray’s Memorials_, p. 50 _n_), and referred to by Mr. Lang\r\n(_History of Scotland_, iv. 441).\r\n\r\n[145] As Traquair left on April 6th (see _ante_, p. 17 and _post_, p.\r\n23) this letter was probably written in that month.

An\r\nardent Jacobite, who sent his son to join the French army when the\r\ninvasion of 1744 was expected.\r\n\r\n[148] French minister in London.\r\n\r\n[149] It wont be amiss to insert here the Story mentioned before\r\nabout the design of sending over some Swedish Troops which my Lord\r\nT[ra]q[uai]r mentioned to me on his return from London the last time he\r\nwent up. Mr. Drummond told me at Paris as an Instance of the sincere\r\nintention the Cardinal had to serve the King, that he was sensible of\r\nthe great hatred the English bore to the French and for that reason\r\nproposed to the Spanish Ambassador at Paris, Campo Florido, that\r\nprovided his master would take 10,000 Swedes into his pay he would\r\nendeavour to procure them by the means of some of the chief nobility,\r\nthe King[650] not being to be trusted on that head as he was looked\r\nupon as friends to the Family of Hanover and would take care to have\r\nthem transported, that the Spanish Ambassador immediately wrote to his\r\nMaster who sent back an answer Willing to pay the Troops but upon some\r\ncondition which I now cannot charge my memory with, this the Cardinal\r\ntook highly amiss and told him that his Master was not to bargain\r\nwith in such cases, upon which the Spanish Ambassador immediately\r\ndispatched a Courier, but before the return of it their was a paragraph\r\nin the Amsterdam Gazette telling that the King of Spain and some of\r\nhis Ministers were carrying on a scheme of great consequence but being\r\nknown by the Queen was prevented. It seems as he said the Queen had\r\nbeen informed of it by some of the Ministers and judging that should\r\nit be putt in execution it would necessarily putt an end to war with\r\nEngland that she was very fond of and to putt a stop to it she putt in\r\nthat paragraph in the Amsterdam Gazette to the Cardinal which had its\r\nobject for their was not any more mention made of it.\r\n\r\n[150] It was no great wonder then I was deceived of his Lordship having\r\nnot the least reason to suspect, and he a little shy cunning fellow on\r\nall occasions professing an attachment to nothing but truth and most\r\ndisinterested loyalty.\r\n\r\n[151] This must have proceded from wrong information for since that\r\ntime they have made considerable levys and everybody agrees their are\r\nnot above ten or eleven thousand in the Island.\r\n\r\n[152] _i.e._ George II.\r\n\r\n[153] This was in the year 1737. If Gordon of Glenbucket went over to\r\nRome, so far as ever I could learn without having any authority from\r\nthe Gentlemen in the Highlands, unless it was from his son-in-law\r\nGlengary and General Gordon,[651] praying the King to come to Scotland\r\nthat all were ready to rise in arms; but His Majesty was too wise\r\nto give in to such a rash and inconsiderate a project and sent over\r\nCaptain Will Hay[652] to have the Opinion of his friends by which he\r\nmight judge how far what Glenbucket had said was to be credited. Mr.\r\nHay sent for me then in Holland and insisted upon my coming which I\r\ndid, but I believe found few people of Glenbucket’s Opinion save the\r\nlate Lord Kinmore[653] who I went to the Country and brought to toun\r\nto see him; but the case was now greatly altered as all the World were\r\nbecoming sensible of; that the Interest of Great Britain must ever be\r\nsacrificed to that of Hanover as long as this family continued upon\r\nthe Throne; that Parliamentary Schemes were nothing but Chimerical,\r\ntogether with the few Troops that were left in the Island and the\r\ndistance they were then from the Coast which prevented their coming\r\nin time before the Country was reduced; as likewise the miserable\r\nprospect of the Country being ruined by the vast standing Army that\r\nwould necessarily follow upon a peace as the Levys during the War would\r\nbe considerable and no prospect of a reduction after their Return but\r\nrather a Certainty of their being continued; this seeming the fairest\r\nopportunity to bring us under a military Government. These and many\r\nother reasons made L[ochie]l be of Opinion that now was the time to\r\nstrike a bold stroke for the King, and by Sir A[lexander] M[acdonald]’s\r\nletter to the Duke of P[erth], it would seem these reasons did\r\ninfluence him and were sufficient Grounds for the proposal.\r\n\r\n[154] John (Lindsay), 20th earl, born 1702.

Died March 1743.\r\n\r\n[156] _i.e._ John Murray.\r\n\r\n[157] This is evidently the letter that Murray complains bitterly\r\nTraquair showed to Balhaldy, and on his advice destroyed (_Murray’s\r\nMemorials_, pp. 58-60).\r\n\r\n[158] This Letter I wrote in the smoothest stile possible purposely\r\nto show him that the King’s friends were so far from having any\r\nInclination to Dictate to him, that on the Contrary they wished by\r\nall means to have him Heartily to promote the Restoration, and shewed\r\nthe letter to Lord T[ra]q[uai]r and L[ochiel]l before I gave it his\r\nLordship to carry and they both approved of it.\r\n\r\n[159] I had mentioned in my Letter to the King that the Ship by which\r\nour Letters used to come was much suspected and had been searched, so\r\none of my Errands was to have a new Conveyance settled which was done\r\nfrom London to Paris by Mr. D[rummond] but could be so easily done from\r\nLondon here.\r\n\r\n[160] His Grace the Duke of P[erth] when I had the honour of seeing him\r\nat York on my Road, desired I would acquaint his Majesty that he had a\r\nScheme for taking Stirling Castle and desired His Majesty would impower\r\nhim upon the Seizing of it to give a commission to whom he should think\r\nfitt to name as Governour for the Time it was garrisoned with his men\r\nas they would the more willingly obey if the Commander was named by\r\nhim, but told me no particulars of his project neither did he since\r\nwhen I told him what the King had wrote.\r\n\r\n[161] Mr. Edgar having wrote about it in a former Letter occasioned my\r\ntelling him that it was borrowed by Lord T[ra]q[uair].\r\n\r\n[162] A frequent cipher name for the Chevalier de St. George.\r\n\r\n[163] Mr. Drummond told when at Paris that the method he had taken\r\nwith the Gentlemen of the highlands was this. He talked to them of the\r\nsituation of the Country and that a Restoration was the only thing\r\nwould save us, with a great deal more to this purpose, which brought\r\nall those that inclined that way to declare how sensible they were\r\nof it and that they were very willing to promote it so soon as an\r\nOccasion should offer; upon which he told them that it was impossible\r\nfor the King to undertake any things not knowing who were his friends\r\nand that he thought they should take care to acquaint the King of it,\r\nthen it was natural for them to say they were contented his Majesty\r\nwas informed it, but did not know of a method how; upon which he told\r\nthem that he would not absolutely promise, but would endeavour to fall\r\nupon a method to acquaint him. This I took to be a safe way for the\r\nperson that engaged them and as his Majesty was not quite satisfied\r\nwith it as he said he desired me to write my Opinion of it which to\r\nthe best of my Remembrance was in a few words, that I thought no Body\r\nwould be so rediculous as to inform against themselves by telling they\r\nhad given a Commission to such a person to ye King as it must redound\r\nto their own disadvantage for as their was none present when the\r\nmatter was spoke off to a person that was to deliver it had no more to\r\ndo but deny it and his not engaging absolutely to make it known was\r\nkeeping his correspondence a secret, for which reasons I was then of\r\nopinion that the same method might be followed in the Low Country, but\r\nupon trial found it almost impossible and dangerous, first, because\r\nthe Generallity are not so loyally inclined as in the Highlands and\r\nconsequently not so easily brought to speak their mind, and the next\r\nplace they have no following, they Generally tell you, of what use is\r\nthe King’s knowing that I wish him well, I am only single Person, that\r\ncan be of little Service, thirdly the present Government has been at\r\npain to perswade people; the King is betrayed and that passes at Rome,\r\nbut what they are fully informed off which makes people shy and affraid\r\nto have any dealings that way as they are near the Court of Justice and\r\nless able to shift for themselves, and fourthly, when a number of those\r\npeople come to be spoke to they will some of them especially who are\r\nnot brought all length in confidence impart to the other that such a\r\nman talked so and so, whereby the thing may come to be known and render\r\nit dangerous for the persons, all this occur’d to me upon serious\r\nreflection and found the difficulty of it, upon talking to some with\r\nfolks here in that stile after my return and succeeded with none but\r\ntwo Mr. N. of D--n and Mr. C--r of Cr--g--th,[654] the last of which\r\nwas drunk and repented next day for which I gave it up.\r\n\r\n[164] A non-juring minister at Edinburgh; father of Lord Eskgrove.\r\n\r\n[165] Sir Alexander Macdonald of Sleat (Skye), 7th baronet. His first\r\nwife was Anne Erskine (died 1735), widow of James (Ogilvy), 4th _de\r\njure_ Earl of Airlie (died 1731). The Earl of Airlie mentioned here was\r\nhis brother, 5th _de jure_ earl (died 1761). He remained passive during\r\nthe ’45, but his son Lord Ogilvy raised two battalions for Prince\r\nCharles.\r\n\r\n[166] Henry, Duke of York, afterwards cardinal.\r\n\r\n[167] I cannot now recollect from whom I had that information, but it\r\nwas such that in the time I had reason to Credit it.\r\n\r\n[168] This was owing to Sir A[lexander] M[acdonald] having promised for\r\na number supperior to what Mr. Drummond had marked him down for and\r\nat the same time as some folks were laying to his Charge we did not\r\nbelieve it was thought fitt to say something favourable of him as we\r\nhad an entire confidence in his honesty.\r\n\r\n[169] Bishop Rattray died at Edinburgh, May 12, 1743.\r\n\r\n[170] Battle of Dettingen, fought 16th June old style, or 27th new\r\nstyle, 1743.\r\n\r\n[171] The Highland Regiment, originally the 43rd and afterwards the\r\n42nd, was raised in the name of John, 20th Earl of Crawford (then lying\r\nwounded at Belgrade), in 1739, and first embodied 1740. It was sent to\r\nLondon in 1743, and there its members, who understood on enlistment\r\nthat their service was for the Highlands only, were persuaded that\r\nthe Government intended to send them to the plantations or to sell\r\nthem into slavery. When encamped at Highgate more than two hundred\r\nof them left the camp by night in May 1743 and started to march to\r\nScotland. They were overtaken and surrounded when near Oundle in\r\nNorthamptonshire; they surrendered and were marched prisoners to the\r\nTower. Three of their leaders were executed, Corporals Samuel and\r\nMalcolm Macpherson and private Farquhar Shaw, all of Clan Chattan.\r\n\r\n[172] There had been heavy recruiting for the Scots Brigade in the\r\nservice of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\n[173] Sir Thomas Gordon of Earlston, 3rd baronet, whose grandfather\r\n(killed at Bothwell Bridge) and father were eminent Covenanter leaders.\r\nMurray hoped to secure the adherence of the Cameronian Covenanters\r\nthrough Gordon and Dr. Cochran (see p. 51) and others. Cf. _Murray’s\r\nMemorials_, p. 54.\r\n\r\n[174] Sir James Stewart; see Appendix.\r\n\r\n[175] David (Wemyss), Lord Elcho, eldest son of James, 4th Earl of\r\nWemyss. Joined Prince Charles at Edinburgh and served through the\r\ncampaign. Forfeited, and lived in exile until his death in 1787. See\r\nhis Memoir by Hon. Evan Charteris, prefaced to _A Short Account of the\r\nAffairs of Scotland_, 1744-46.\r\n\r\n[176] Norman Macleod of Macleod, nineteenth chief; born 1706; died\r\n1772. He engaged to join Prince Charles although he came alone; but he\r\nchanged his mind, was the first to communicate the Prince’s landing\r\nto the Lord President, and was the vindictive foe of Prince Charles\r\nthroughout the whole adventure.\r\n\r\n[177] This was Alexander (or Alistair), Lord Lovat’s second son, by his\r\nwife Margaret Grant, sister of Sir James Grant of Grant. Born 1729,\r\ndied unmarried 1762.\r\n\r\nThe school at Prestonpans was kept by Mr. John Halket who had been\r\ntutor in Lovat’s family at Castle Downie. Peggy Vint’s was a tavern in\r\nPrestonpans. Alexander Carlyle gives an account of an extraordinary\r\ncarouse there in 1741, at which Lovat, Erskine of Grange, Halket, four\r\nFraser henchmen, young Lovat, Halket’s son, and Carlyle were present.\r\nLovat said Grace in French, and he ‘swore more than fifty dragoons’\r\nat the fish. The claret was excellent and circulated fast. There was\r\na piper at the tavern, and the landlady’s daughter Kate was ‘very\r\nalluring.’ Lovat, then seventy-five, and Grange not much younger,\r\nwarmed with wine, insisted on dancing a reel with Kate Vint: ‘this was\r\na scene not easily forgotten.’ A banquet at Grange’s house of Preston,\r\nwith a ‘new deluge of excellent claret,’ finished what Carlyle calls ‘a\r\nvery memorable day.’--Carlyle, _Autobiography_, p. 58.\r\n\r\n[178] About this time Sir J. Ca[mpbe]ll had the misfortune to have\r\nhis house burnt and lost everything in it, even to his Body Cloaks.\r\nThe deplorable situation he was in, never having received any of the\r\nmoney promised him save 200£ call for immediate assistance, and still\r\nthe more so, that he had from time to time borrowed Money upon his\r\nHonour to Return it in such a time, as he had always reason to expect\r\nhis pension wou’d answer, his failing in which necessarly weakened his\r\nInterest in the Country, for two reasons: 1st that he had no money\r\nto enable him to entertain and visit his neighbours, and 2ndly So he\r\nwas not able to keep his word to them from whom he had borrowed it.\r\nBoth shaggerined him and naturally made him the less confided in other\r\nmatters, for which reasons I wrote presently to my Lord T[ra]q[uai]r,\r\nto write Mr. Drummond then at London, that the money might be gott\r\nas he then had the bond I mentioned before in his Custody, but he\r\nstill putt it off by saying that nothing could be done in it till he\r\nwent over, as the money was to be gott in france, which was a most\r\nrediculous reason, for he told me in paris that it was through Lord\r\nSemple he was to find it, which had it been the Case there was no\r\noccasion for the things being delayed till he went over, as he was to\r\nhave no influence but ought to have sent it to Lord Semple. However\r\nI don’t believe it will be found upon inquiring yt, Lord Semple knew\r\nany thing of the matter for Mr. Drummond would not agree that I should\r\nmention the thing to him when at paris, so that I am fully convinced\r\nthat it was as I have said befor, all a fetch to prevent writing to\r\nthe King about it, for fear that he should be disapointed of the 4,000\r\nLivres a year he has since got settled upon him.\r\n\r\n[179] Lord Lovat must surely have been deceiving or deceived. It was\r\nthe proud boast of the Monroes that the clan had remained constant to\r\nCovenanting principles and to the Protestant succession, being the only\r\nWhig clan that never wavered. The Munroes were the only Highlanders who\r\njoined Cope on his march to Inverness in 1745.\r\n\r\n[180] John Boyle, 5th earl; succeeded as 5th Earl of Cork, 1751; a man\r\nof letters; friend of Swift, Pope, and Johnson; died 1762.\r\n\r\n[181] Of Wynnstay, 3rd Baronet, M.P. for Denbigh, an ardent Jacobite,\r\nalmost openly avowed.\r\n\r\n[182] 7th February 1744.\r\n\r\n[183] He is marry’d to a sister of mine, and upon the Change of the\r\nMinistry was made keeper of the Signet, through the Marquiss of\r\nTweedales Interest in the Room of Mr. Mcmillan the Writer.\r\n\r\n[184] Thomas Hay of Huntington, East Lothian, advocate; Keeper of\r\nthe Signet, 1742-46; raised to the Bench as Lord Huntington 1754.\r\nHis brother, John Hay of Restalrig, W.S., succeeded John Murray as\r\nSecretary to Prince Charles on Murray’s falling ill at Inverness, in\r\n1746.\r\n\r\n[185] Robert Dundas of Arniston, first President Dundas; born 1685;\r\nwas Lord Advocate, 1720-25; raised to the Bench as Lord Arniston 1737;\r\nbecame Lord President on the death of Duncan Forbes of Culloden 1748;\r\ndied 1753.

As for the reason they\r\ngive, in my Opinion it is inexpressibly frivelous and even betraying\r\nof their own want of a hearty Zeal, for their Masters Interest. For\r\nhad I, either from Roguery, Ignorance, or folly, deceived Mr. Burnet\r\nin what I said, it was no reason for their Giving up a Scheme of such\r\nExtensive consequence, which plainly shows its not from principle they\r\nAct. At the same time I cannot see the least ground to believe they\r\nhad any scheme going on, as they kept no correspondance with any of\r\nthe Ministers save Mr. Orri,[655] as I was informed whose department\r\ndid not lead him to treat of such like matters, neither was there then\r\nthe least thing for an Expedition. As to my advice to Mr. Burnet, it\r\nis sufficient he knew it to be in every sense absolutely false, but\r\nthe view they had in so doing is too obvious not to be seen through.\r\nThey knew Kinny was just going over, and, as he is a man of Consequence\r\nin the Country, could they have influenced him against me they would\r\nthereby have broke the force of my Representations, being satisfied\r\nI would not fail in my arrival here to make known their shameful\r\nprocedure to Mr. Edwards friends, and I must observe since at it was a\r\nvery convenient time as Mr. Burnet seemed resolved to make the Money\r\nthey promised to procure for Arms, the touchstone of their Veracity,\r\nand the frenches sincerity, so that their refusing to act at that time\r\nprevented the Sd--v believing them baffled men.\r\n\r\n[241] Captain John Drummond, a nephew of Balhaldy’s.\r\n\r\n[242] Prince Charles.\r\n\r\n[243] Prince Charles.\r\n\r\n[244] King.\r\n\r\n[245] Rome.\r\n\r\n[246] The Chevalier de St. George.\r\n\r\n[247] Duke of Perth.\r\n\r\n[248] Earl of Traquair.\r\n\r\n[249] Lochiel.\r\n\r\n[250] Scotland.\r\n\r\n[251] James Fea of Clestrain (or Clesterton), in Stronsay, constituted\r\nhimself a Jacobite leader in Orkney and attempted to raise men for\r\nthe Prince. In March 1746 when Lord Macleod took his regiment to\r\nThurso, Mackenzie of Ardloch, invited by Fea, went over to Stromness\r\nto raise men and money. None of the islanders were willing to go out,\r\nand Ardloch declined to take unwilling recruits although Fea offered\r\nto press some men. Ardloch, however, carried off £145 of cess and a\r\nquantity of smuggled brandy. For his indiscretion, Fea’s house of Sound\r\nin the island of Shapinsay was burnt down in May by the crews of a\r\nsquadron sent to hunt down Jacobites, while Fea concealed himself in\r\nCaithness until the passing of the Act of Indemnity. (See Allan Fea,\r\n_The Real Captain Cleveland_, p. 175; _L. in M._, ii. 337.)\r\n\r\n[252] A battle fought at Altimarlach three miles west of Wick, in 1680,\r\nbetween George Sinclair of Keiss, afterwards 7th Earl of Caithness and\r\nSir John Campbell of Glenurchy, afterwards 1st Earl of Breadalbane.\r\nSinclair’s kinsman the 6th earl, falling into debt and having no\r\nchildren, had disponed his titles, property and heritable jurisdictions\r\nto Sir John Campbell, the principal creditor, who married the earl’s\r\nwidow in 1678, having managed the previous year to secure a patent\r\nfrom Charles II. as Earl of Caithness. Sinclair of Keiss resisted his\r\nclaims by force, and Campbell marched an army of his own men and some\r\nroyal troops to Caithness. The first advantage was with the Sinclairs,\r\nwho celebrated the event with drunken revelry aggravated by finding\r\na whisky-laden ship strategically stranded by the Campbells in Wick\r\nharbour. Next day the Sinclairs were defeated. It was on this occasion\r\nthat the air ‘The Campbells are coming’ was composed by Finlay Macivor\r\nthe celebrated piper of Breadalbane. (Calder, _Hist. of Caithness_, p.\r\n162.) The courts found later that Keiss (grandson of the 5th earl) was\r\nentitled to the Caithness earldom; Sir John Campbell was compensated by\r\nbeing created Earl of Breadalbane in 1681, but with the precedency of\r\nthe Caithness grant 1677.\r\n\r\n[253] This Mr. Gilchrist is scathingly treated in _The Lyon_ (iii.\r\n36). He went ‘to Edinburgh and thence to London to misrepresent and\r\nasperse the bulk of the Caithness gentry as enemies to the present\r\nestablishment.’ He is further said to have collected 250 guineas\r\nfor himself and to have made his friends ‘believe that he could not\r\ncontinue in Caithness for the wicked Jacobites who had threatened to\r\ntake away his life and destroy his family.’ The writer, a non-juring\r\nminister, who had been a prisoner in London, adds sententiously ‘Honest\r\nWhigry that never thinks shame of lying for worldly interest!’\r\n\r\n[254] George Sinclair of Geese, afterwards captured at Dunrobin, was\r\nthe only Caithness Sinclair of position who joined the Jacobite army.\r\nLord Macleod marched through Caithness in March 1746, but though\r\nthe proprietors professed Jacobite sympathies, very few joined his\r\nstandard. (Fraser, _The Earls of Cromartie_, ii. 398.)\r\n\r\n[255] Sir James Stewart of Burray, Orkney, took no active part in the\r\nRising, but he was apprehended on suspicion in May 1746, and taken\r\nprisoner to London, where he died of fever in the New Gaol, Southwark,\r\nthe following August.\r\n\r\n[256] George (Mackay), 3rd Lord Reay, b. 1678; suc. his grandfather\r\n_c._ 1680; supported government in 1715; was largely instrumental in\r\nestablishing the presbytery of Tongue 1725; d. 1748.\r\n\r\n[257] William (Gordon-Sutherland), 16th earl; b. 1708; suc. his\r\ngrandfather 1720; d. 1750. His wife was Lady Elizabeth Wemyss, aunt\r\nof Lord Elcho of the ’45. His father acted vigorously against the\r\nJacobites in ’15 and ’19.\r\n\r\n[258] Assynt in ancient times was the territory of the MacNicols\r\n(or MacRyculs or Nicolsons), but in the time of David II. Torquil\r\nMacleod IV., of Lewis, married the heiress and obtained the lands.\r\nThe MacNicols emigrated to Skye, where they have been for centuries.\r\nMacleod’s second son inherited Assynt, and there were twelve Macleod\r\nlairds. The last of these was Neil Macleod who was tried in 1666, and\r\nagain in 1674, for betraying the great Marquis of Montrose and other\r\ncrimes. He was acquitted, but, probably owing to the expense of the\r\ntrials, he fell into debt, and was driven from his lands which were\r\nacquired by the Mackenzies. _Cf._ p. 107, _n._ 1.\r\n\r\n[259] See _post_, p. 96.\r\n\r\n[260] The writer is wrong here. It was the first earl’s grandfather,\r\nSir Roderick Mackenzie (1579-1626), the terrible Tutor of Kintail who\r\nmarried Margaret heiress of Torquil Macleod of Lewis and Cogeach.\r\nGeorge (Mackenzie), 1st Earl of Cromarty (1630-1714), was the\r\nantiquary. He was an original member of the Royal Society (London),\r\nfounded 1662.\r\n\r\n[261] See _post_, p. 104.\r\n\r\n[262] A battle at Sgeir na Caillich on Lochalsh, between the Straits\r\nof Kylerhea and Kyleakin. According to the Clan Donald historians,\r\nthe battle was fought in 1603. It was not Glengarry (Donald, 7th of\r\nGlengarry, who died in 1645, aged 102), but his eldest son Angus,\r\n‘Young Glengarry,’ who was killed.\r\n\r\n[263] Now called Glenshiel. The church was erected in the hamlet of\r\nMuick.\r\n\r\n[264] It is hardly likely that the Macraes will accept this suggestion\r\nof descent without strong corroboration which does not seem to exist.\r\nA very different origin is given by the Rev. Roderick Morison,\r\nminister of Kintail in 1793: ‘It is generally allowed that the Mac\r\nRaes emigrated from the braes of Aird, on the Lovat estate, to this\r\nplace, though what induced them to prefer the mountains to the plains\r\nis not universally agreed upon, yet certain it is, that long after\r\ntheir residence in Kintail, they maintained a firm alliance with the\r\nFrasers of Aird. The tradition which prevails, that an inscription was\r\nset up nigh the entrance to Lovat House, bearing “That no Mac Rae must\r\nlodge without, when a Fraser resides within,” is not wholly without\r\nfoundation. When the Mac Raes first entered Kintail, there were several\r\nclans inhabiting it, particularly the Mac Aulays, of whom no vestige\r\nnow remains. The Mac Lennans, a small tribe in the parish of Glensheal,\r\nwere the only people that would not yield. These Mac Lennans, at the\r\nbattle of Auldearn, were intrusted with Seaforth’s colours. The novelty\r\nof the preferment roused them to action and stubborn resistance, which\r\nproved fatal to the clan, for many were slain; and their widows, 18\r\nin number, were afterwards married to Mac Raes. The boundaries which\r\ndivide the Mac Raes from the Mac Lennans are marked by a river which\r\nruns into Lochduich; but common observation may easily trace a line\r\nof distinction from the difference in their language and accent.’ Mr.\r\nMorison gives the derivation of the name as _Mhac Ragh_, the son of\r\ngood fortune, applied by the founder to his son after some successful\r\nexploits.--(_Statistical Account of Scotland_, vi. 242; the story of\r\nthe great slaughter of Maclellans at Auldearn is modified by latest\r\ninvestigators.) The word _Ragh_ or _Rath_ may mean either ‘good\r\nfortune’ or ‘grace,’ and the latest clan historian, Rev. Alex. Macrae,\r\nis of opinion that the name has an ecclesiastical origin as the ‘son of\r\ngrace’ applied to a holy man of old. Relying on tradition, he inclines\r\nto believe that the Macraes were from Clunes in the Aird and were of\r\ncommon origin with the Mackenzies and Macleans.\r\n\r\nThe Kintail Macraes were not out in ’45. There was, however, a certain\r\nCaptain MacRaw in Glengarry’s regiment; he attended Prince Charles when\r\nin Lochaber during his wanderings; also a Lieut. Alexander M‘Ra from\r\nBanff; and one of the French officers taken prisoner at sea on the\r\nvoyage to Scotland, was Captain James Macraith of Berwick’s regiment.\r\nGilchrist Macgrath or M‘Kra entertained the Prince in Glen Shiel in\r\nhis wanderings. Murdoch M‘Raw, ‘nearest relation to the chieftain of\r\nthat name,’ was barbarously hanged as a spy at Inverness protesting his\r\ninnocence. (_L. in M._, i. 205, 342; iii. 378; ii. 205, 299.)\r\n\r\n[265] See Dickson, _The Jacobite Attempt of 1719_ (Scot. Hist. Soc.,\r\nvol. xix.).\r\n\r\n[266] The Long Island is the name given to the chain of the outer\r\nHebrides from the Butt of Lewis to Barra Head, comprising Lewis and\r\nHarris, North Uist, Benbecula, South Uist, Eriska, Barra and Mingulay.\r\n\r\n[267] The story of the transference of the lands of the ancient and\r\npowerful family of Macleod of Lewis to the Mackenzies is one of the\r\nmost pitiful in Highland history. Towards the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, Roderick (or Ruari) Macleod, the last undisputed Macleod of\r\nLewis, married, as his first wife, a natural daughter of John Mackenzie\r\nof Kintail. The wife eloped, the son, named Torquil Connanach, was\r\nrepudiated. Torquil was brought up at Strath Connan (hence his\r\n‘to-name’) by the Mackenzies, who embraced his cause. From that moment\r\nthe family of Lewis was doomed. Partly by purchase, partly by marriage,\r\nbut largely by intrigue and violence the lands of Macleod were acquired\r\nby the Mackenzies. Lewis was driven to anarchy; feuds of the worst type\r\nensued, father against sons, brothers murdering brothers. Government\r\ninterfered; Lewis was forfeited and parcelled out among Lowland\r\ncolonist-adventurers, who were thwarted by the Mackenzies, and at last\r\nwere glad to go, and in 1610 to dispose of their rights to Mackenzie,\r\nwho had become Lord Kintail the previous year. Any rights that remained\r\nto his cousin Torquil Macleod were made over to the Mackenzies.\r\nMeantime, in 1605, Kintail’s brother Roderick had married the daughter\r\nand heiress of Torquil, and became possessed of the mainland property\r\nof Coigeach. As soon as the Mackenzies obtained the island, they\r\npromptly restored order; the remaining members of the old Macleod\r\nfamily were murdered or driven out under a commission of fire and\r\nsword. Kintail’s son became an earl in 1623, and took his title from\r\nLoch Seaforth in Lewis, while his uncle Roderick, tutor of Kintail,\r\nterrible and ruthless (of whom the Gaelic proverb says ‘there are two\r\nthings worse than the Tutor of Kintail, frost in spring and mist in\r\nthe dog-days’), built a castle in Strathpeffer, which he called Castle\r\nLeod, and when his grandson obtained the earldom of Cromarty in 1685,\r\nthe second title then assumed was that of ‘Lord Macleod,’ to show that\r\nthe heritage of the old family of Macleod of Lewis remained with him.\r\n\r\n[268] Roderick Macneill of Barra was from home when Prince Charles\r\nlanded in the neighbouring island of Eriska, July ’45. He took no\r\nactive part in the rising but was arrested on suspicion in July ’46,\r\ntaken to London, released in ’47.\r\n\r\n[269] For the Macdonald divisions and claims, see Appendix,\r\n\r\n[270] John Mackinnon of Mackinnon was the only one of the three\r\nSkye chiefs who went out. He joined with his clan at Edinburgh, and\r\nserved throughout the campaign, but was absent on duty in Sutherland\r\nwhen Culloden was fought. He was attainted. Prince Charles went to\r\nhim in his wanderings, and the chief conducted him from Skye to the\r\nmainland, for which service he was made prisoner, taken to London, but\r\nreleased in July ’47. He died in Skye, in ’56, aged 75 years. He was a\r\nson-in-law of Archbishop Sharpe of St. Andrews.\r\n\r\n[271] This is a reference to the well-known story of the conversion of\r\nthe islanders. The laird, a man ‘much respected,’ an elder of the kirk,\r\nreproved by the General Assembly for allowing his people to remain\r\nin popery, retrieved his character by driving his tenants from the\r\nCatholic chapel to the Protestant church with the vigorous application\r\nof a gold-headed cane, called by the Highlanders a yellow stick: from\r\nthis the Presbyterian religion became known in the islands as Creidimh\r\na bhata bhui, the creed of the yellow stick. Cf. Bellesheim’s _Hist.\r\nCath. Church Scot._ (iv. 188).\r\n\r\n[272] Called the Parish of the Small Isles.\r\n\r\n[273] Modernly, Loch Hourn = Hell Loch.\r\n\r\n[274] Scotus and Barisdale were brothers, both being uncles of the\r\nchief of Glengarry. The elder, Angus Macdonell of Scotus, was an old\r\nman in ’45, and died the following year. He remained at home, but\r\nhis eldest son Donald went out with Glengarry. Donald fell wounded\r\nat Culloden, and was supposed to have died on the field. The clan\r\nhistorians, however, state that evidence has been found in the Stuart\r\nPapers at Windsor that certain marauders landed from a ship at night,\r\ncarried off a number of wounded, among them Donald of Scotus, who\r\nafter various adventures was captured by Turkish pirates, and held in\r\nbondage ever afterwards. (_History of Clan Donald_, iii. 324.) Two\r\nof Scotus’s younger sons John and Allan were captains in Glengarry’s\r\nregiment. Donald’s eldest son Ranald fought on the Government side in\r\n’45 in Loudoun’s regiment. Ranald’s grandson succeeded in 1868 as 18th\r\nhereditary chief of Glengarry.\r\n\r\nFor Macdonell of Barisdale, see _post_, p. 96.\r\n\r\n[275] The _Morar_ family was really not a cadet, but the senior branch\r\nof the Clanranald family, descended from the eldest son of Dougall, 6th\r\nClanranald, who was deposed by the clan for cruelty and oppression, and\r\nhis children excluded for ever from the chiefship, which was conferred\r\non his uncle. Dougall was assassinated in 1520; his family, on whom the\r\nlands of Morar were conferred, were known as the ‘MacDhughail Mhorair.’\r\nIn 1745 the laird of Morar was Allan, whose mother was a Macdonald of\r\nSleat. He must have been an elderly man, as his wife was an aunt of\r\nLochiel’s, the youngest daughter of Sir Ewan Cameron by his third wife,\r\ndaughter of the Quaker David Barclay of Urie. Morar was one of the\r\nfirst to meet the Prince on his reaching Lochnanuagh in July ’45. He\r\nserved as lieut-colonel of the Clanranald regiment. Prince Charles in\r\nhis wanderings came to him for hospitality in July ’46, and Morar could\r\nonly give him a cave to sleep in as his house had been burned down. His\r\nreception of the Prince, prompted it is said by young Clanranald, was\r\nvery cold, and he was the object of fierce invective by the chief of\r\nMackinnon, and of sorrowful reproach by Charles himself. (_L. in M._,\r\niii. 187.) According to the clan historians, Morar had the reputation\r\nof being ‘an unmanly, drunken creature all his life.’ (_Hist. Cl.\r\nDonald_, iii. 256.)\r\n\r\nMr. Andrew Lang says that Morar was the author of the _Journal and\r\nMemorial of P---- C---- Expedition into Scotland_ (printed in the\r\n_Lockhart Papers_), which is a principal source of knowledge of the\r\nearly days of the adventure. Mr. Lang did not remember his authority,\r\nbut was certain of its authenticity. (I had been assured in Moidart\r\nthat the _Journal_ was by young Ranald of Kinloch-Moidart, but without\r\nproof.) Allan of Morar died in 1756. His eldest son, John, was ‘out,’\r\nbut in what capacity he served I have failed to trace. Morar’s\r\nstep-brother, John of Guidale, was a captain in the Clanranald regiment.\r\n\r\nAnother step-brother was Hugh Macdonald, who had been educated for the\r\nChurch in France. He was reported to Rome as a ‘scion of one of the\r\nnoblest branches of the Macdonalds.... He himself is distinguished\r\neven more for his zeal and piety than for his honourable birth, and\r\nis also a man of singular prudence and modesty.’ (Bellesheim, iv.\r\n386.) He was consecrated Bishop of Diana _in partibus_ in 1731, and\r\nappointed vicar-apostolic of the Highlands. The Bishop visited the\r\nPrince on board ship on his first arrival, and implored him to return.\r\nWhen the Standard was raised in Glenfinnan it was blessed by Bishop\r\nHugh. What part he took during the campaign I do not know, but after\r\nthe debacle, he accompanied Lord Lovat in his hiding in Morar. When the\r\nfugitives were pounced upon by Ferguson’s party (see _post_, pp. 90,\r\n244) Lovat was captured, but the Bishop escaped and went to France, in\r\nSeptember, along with Prince Charles. He returned to Scotland in 1749,\r\nwhen he had an interview with Bishop Forbes, who veils his identity by\r\ncalling him ‘Mr. Hugh.’ (_L. in M._, iii. 50.) He was betrayed in July\r\n1755, and arrested, released on bail, and obliged to reside at Duns\r\nuntil the following February, when he was sentenced by the High Court\r\nto perpetual banishment. (_Scots. Mag._, xvii. 358, xviii. 100.) By\r\nconnivance of the authorities, the sentence was not enforced, and he\r\nremained in Scotland until his death, which occurred in Glengarry in\r\n1773.\r\n\r\nThe _Kinlochmoidart_ family descends from the 9th Clanranald (d.\r\n1593). The laird in 1745 was Donald Macdonald; his mother was Margaret\r\nCameron, the only sister of Lochiel of the ’45; his wife was a daughter\r\nof Stewart of Appin. Donald, as a boy, had fought at Sheriffmuir.\r\nHis brother Æneas, a banker in Paris, came over from France with\r\nPrince Charles. On arrival in Scotland Æneas was sent to summon the\r\nlaird. Kinlochmoidart, who was given a commission as colonel and made\r\naide-de-camp to the Prince, was at once despatched to summon his uncle\r\nLochiel, and other Jacobite leaders. Prince Charles lived in his\r\nhouse from August 11th to 18th. When a captive the following year,\r\nKinlochmoidart was asked what made him embark in the adventure, ‘Lord,\r\nman’ he replied, ‘what could I do when the young lad came to my house.’\r\n(_Carlisle in 1745_, p. 266.) It is interesting from the point of view\r\nof Highland hospitality to compare this reply with the advice given to\r\nPrince Charles by Clanranald’s brother, Boisdale, who had an interview\r\nwith the Prince at Eriska on his first arrival, but refused to rise.\r\nWhen he found it impossible to dissuade the Prince from his enterprise\r\nhe ‘insisted that he ought to land on the estate of Macdonald of\r\nSleat or in that of Macleod, for if he trusted himself to them in the\r\nbeginning they would certainly join him which otherwise they would\r\nnot do. The Prince would not follow this counsel, being influenced by\r\nothers.’ (Bishop Geddes’s MS.) Kinlochmoidart was made prisoner at\r\nLesmahagow in Lanarkshire, in November ’45, while returning to the army\r\nfrom an unsuccessful mission to Sir Alexander of Sleat and Macleod. The\r\nprincipal agent in his capture was a divinity student, Thomas Lining,\r\nafterwards rewarded with the living of Lesmahagow. The chieftain was\r\ntried at Carlisle, and there hanged on 18th October ’46. His head was\r\nfixed on the Scots Gate, where it remained for many years. His house\r\nwas burned down.\r\n\r\nKinlochmoidart’s family was deeply implicated in the Rising. Four\r\nof his brothers served in Clanranald’s regiment: John, a doctor of\r\nmedicine, who was one of Ferguson’s victims in the _Furness_; he\r\nafterwards returned to Moidart; Ranald, whose chivalrous championship\r\nof the Prince’s cause, gave the first note of enthusiasm to the\r\nadventure (Home, _Hist. Reb._, p. 39); Allan, who fled to France and\r\nperished in the Revolution; James, who was captured at Culloden, but\r\nescaped; he was exempted from the general pardon, and is supposed\r\nto have gone to America. A fifth brother, Æneas the Paris banker,\r\nwas captured, tried, and sentenced to death. He escaped from Newgate\r\nby throwing snuff in the turnkey’s eyes, but being shod with loose\r\nslippers he tripped when flying along Warwick Lane and was retaken. He\r\nreceived a conditional pardon, returned to France, and was killed in\r\nthe Revolution.\r\n\r\n[276] The property was acquired in 1726 by Sir David Murray of Stanhope\r\n(Peeblesshire) 2nd bart., the father of John Murray of Broughton. He\r\ndied in 1729, but the work of developing the lead mines and minerals\r\nwas carried on by his son, Sir James. In 1745 the proprietor was Sir\r\nDavid Murray, 4th bart., nephew of Sir James, He was ‘out,’ served as\r\naide-de-camp to the Prince, and fought at Falkirk and Culloden. He was\r\ncaptured at Whitby endeavouring to escape; was tried at York; sentenced\r\nto death; conditionally pardoned; and died an exile in 1770. The\r\nforfeited estate in Ardnamurchan was sold for £33,700.\r\n\r\n[277] Of Torcastle, fourth son of Sir Ewan Cameron. He was attainted.\r\nAfter Culloden he remained in Lochaber, and was agent for distributing\r\nmoney to the Camerons. At the end of ’47 he was still free, having\r\nevaded all attempts at capture (_Albemarle Papers_); of his subsequent\r\ncareer I have no knowledge.\r\n\r\n[278] Sir Hector Maclean of Duart (Mull), 5th bart., who was major of\r\nLord John Drummond’s French regiment of Royal Scots, had been sent from\r\nFrance to Edinburgh in May, and was made prisoner there in June, and\r\nremoved to London. He was tried for his life, but on proving that he\r\nwas born in Calais he was treated as a prisoner of war. Charles Maclean\r\nof Drimnin (Morvern) joined the Prince after the battle of Falkirk; at\r\nCulloden, where Drimnin was killed, his Macleans were formed into a\r\nregiment with the Maclachlans, commanded by the chief of Maclachlan.\r\nAllan Maclean of Brolas, who succeeded Sir Hector in 1750, as 6th\r\nbart., joined the Government side.

Writing to the\r\nBishop in 1748, he says, ‘I live for the most part now like a hermite,\r\nbecause all my late charge almost were kill’d in battle, scatter’d\r\nabroad or are cow’d at home. (_L. in M._, ii. 210.)\r\n\r\n[282] Dugald Stewart, 8th chief of Appin and last of the direct male\r\nline. Although a Jacobite, and created a peer, as Lord Appin, by James,\r\nin 1743, he did not join Prince Charles. His clan, one of the first\r\nto rise, was led out by his kinsman Charles Stewart, 5th of Ardshiel.\r\nDugald Stewart sold Appin in 1765, and died 1769.\r\n\r\n[283] Alexander Macdonald of Glencoe was attainted; he surrendered some\r\ntime after Culloden; he was in prison as late as 1750; date of release\r\nor of death not ascertained. Two brothers, James and Donald, went out\r\nwith him in ’45.\r\n\r\n[284] Lochiel’s brother, Alexander Cameron, third son of John of\r\nLochiel, joined the Church of Rome, and became a Jesuit. I have failed\r\nto trace what part he took during the campaign; but in July 1746 he\r\nwas arrested at Morar and put on board the _Furness_, the ship of the\r\nnotorious Captain Ferguson. Father Cameron was carried to the Thames;\r\nhe suffered great hardships, and died at Gravesend on board ship.\r\n(_Albemarle Papers_, p. 408; _L. in M._, i. 312.)\r\n\r\n[285] The last clan battle of importance, known as the Battle of\r\nMulroy, fought in Glenroy, August 1688. The Mackintoshes, who had\r\nobtained charters of Keppoch’s country, were ever at feud with Keppoch,\r\nwho legally owned none of the land his clan occupied. It is said that\r\non this occasion Macdonell of Keppoch (‘Coll of the Cows’) treated his\r\nprisoner Mackintosh so kindly that the latter in gratitude offered\r\nhim a charter of the lands in dispute. Keppoch declined, saying, that\r\nhe would never consent to hold by sheepskin what he had won by the\r\nsword. (_Hist. of Clan Donald_, ii. 645.) Murray of Broughton, however,\r\nstates that as the result of this battle Mackintosh granted Keppoch an\r\nadvantageous lease, which was still running in 1745. (_Memorials_, p.\r\n443.)\r\n\r\n[286] In 1745 the chief of Keppoch, Alexander (son of Coll), was a\r\nProtestant. When his clan joined the Prince he refused to allow a\r\nfavourite priest to accompany it, and in consequence, a number of\r\nhis people deserted when at Aberchalder. Keppoch had been created a\r\nJacobite baronet in 1743. His death at Culloden has been the theme of\r\nmuch romance. For some late light on the subject, see Mr. Andrew Lang’s\r\n_Hist. of Scot._, iv. 527.\r\n\r\n[287] The Grants of Glenmoriston joined the Glengarry regiment.\r\n\r\n[288] Not the eldest son, but the third son, Allan Grant of Innerwick.\r\nHe was taken prisoner by the Jacobites at the bloodless battle of\r\nDornoch. Lord John Murray’s regiment is the Highland Regiment (Black\r\nWatch).\r\n\r\n[289] See _post_, p. 281 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[290] Contrary to what I find is a general impression, the religion\r\nof Lord Lovat and his family, as well as his clan, was Protestant. It\r\nis true that in his days of outlawry and exile in France, about 1703,\r\nLovat feigned conversion to Romanism, yet from his return to Scotland\r\nin ’15, until his capture in ’46, he conformed to the Presbyterian\r\nestablishment; his bosom friend and crony was the gloomy and dissolute\r\nfanatic, James Erskine, Lord Grange. When in hiding after Culloden,\r\nalong with Bishop Hugh Macdonald, in Loch Morar (see _ante_, p. 82)\r\nLovat informed the Bishop that he had long been a Catholic in his\r\nheart, and wished to be received into the Church. He was preparing\r\nto make his confession, but before the rite could be accomplished,\r\nthe fugitives were dispersed by a party of Campbells and seamen from\r\nFerguson’s ship, and Lord Lovat surrendered a few days later. Though\r\nhe desired the services of the chaplain of the Sardinian embassy while\r\na prisoner in the Tower, where on one occasion he pronounced himself\r\na Jansenist, and although he declared ‘Je meurs un fils indigne de\r\nl’Église Romaine,’ there is no evidence, which I know of, that he ever\r\nformally joined that communion.\r\n\r\n[291] See _post_, p. 99.\r\n\r\n[292] Robert Bruce, ordained minister at Edinburgh 1587; Moderator of\r\nthe Kirk 1588 and 1592, was the son of Bruce of Airth, Stirlingshire, a\r\nrude and powerful baron of a family collateral with the royal Bruces.\r\nAt first Bruce was in high favour with James VI., who placed him on\r\nthe council of regency when he went to Denmark to be married, 1589,\r\nand appointed him to officiate at the coronation of Queen Anne the\r\nfollowing year. Subsequently he thwarted the king in his ecclesiastical\r\npolicy as well as in refusing to acknowledge the guilt of the Earl of\r\nGowrie, who had been his pupil. James had him deposed from his parish,\r\nand banished from Edinburgh, 1600. Part of his exile was passed at\r\nInverness (1605-9, and again 1620-24), where he preached to crowded\r\ncongregations every Sunday. He died at Kinnaird, 1631.\r\n\r\n[293] See _post_, p. 104.\r\n\r\n[294] The valley of the Findhorn river, Inverness, Nairn, and Moray\r\nshires.\r\n\r\n[295] See _post_, pp. 100, 410.\r\n\r\n[296] See _post_, p. 269 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[297] Now called Strathavon.\r\n\r\n[298] Duncan Forbes of Culloden; b. 1685; M.P. Inverness-shire 1722;\r\nLord Advocate 1725; Lord President of the Court of Session 1737; d.\r\n1747.\r\n\r\n[299] George (Mackenzie), 3rd earl; b. about 1702; known as the\r\nMaster of Macleod until his grandfather’s death, 1714; as Lord Tarbat\r\nuntil his father’s death, 1731, when he succeeded to the earldom. His\r\nfather, although a friend and cousin of Lord Mar, had not gone out in\r\n1715. The Earl married, 1724, Isabella, daughter of Sir Wm. Gordon of\r\nInvergordon, head of a family ‘noted for their zeal for the Protestant\r\nsuccession.’ He was captured at Dunrobin 1746; condemned to death by\r\nthe House of Lords; released with a conditional pardon 1749; d. at\r\nLondon 1766.\r\n\r\n[300] John (Mackenzie), Lord Macleod, eldest son of 3rd Earl of\r\nCromartie; b. 1727. Captured along with his father; pled guilty;\r\nreceived a conditional pardon 1748; went abroad 1749; entered the\r\nSwedish service when the Old Chevalier, at the request of Lord George\r\nMurray, sent him the necessary funds for his military outfit; became\r\ncolonel, aide-de-camp to the King of Sweden, and Count Cromartie;\r\nreturned to England 1777; raised a regiment for King George, first\r\nknown as Macleod’s Highlanders, the 73rd, subsequently the 71st, and\r\nto-day the Highland Light Infantry; M.P. for Ross-shire 1780; family\r\nestates restored to him 1784; m. 1786, Margery, d. of Lord Forbes; d.\r\n_s.p._ 1789.\r\n\r\n[301] There were three Macdonells all bearing the designation of\r\nBarisdale in the ’Forty-five, who are often confused, and who for\r\ndistinction’s sake may be termed here, Old Barisdale, Young Barisdale,\r\nand Youngest Barisdale.\r\n\r\n_Old Barisdale_ was Archibald Macdonell, an uncle of Glengarry and\r\na brother of Scotus. He paid his respects to Prince Charles at\r\nGlenfinnan, but took no active part in the Rising, probably being too\r\nold to go out. In May 1746, however, his house was burned down by\r\nCumberland’s order, and he was carried prisoner on board a ship of war,\r\nbut was soon released. He died in 1752.\r\n\r\n_Young Barisdale_ was Archibald’s eldest son, Coll Macdonell, who\r\nis a prominent figure in the rising. He was born in 1698. A man\r\nof commanding talent, he filled the _rôle_ of Highland cateran to\r\nperfection, and raised a following absolutely devoted to him. He\r\nbecame captain of the watch and guardian of the marches for western\r\nInverness-shire, a vocation (similar to that of his great prototype,\r\nRob Roy) which he exercised with rigour and occasional cruelty. He was\r\nable to purchase several wadsets, which gave him territorial importance\r\nin the western Highlands. He further strengthened his influence\r\nin Ross-shire by his marriages, his first wife being a daughter\r\nof George Mackenzie of Balmuchie, and his second wife a sister of\r\nAlexander Mackenzie, then laird of Fairburn. He joined Prince Charles\r\nat Aberchalder on 27th August at the head of Glengarry’s Knoydart\r\nmen, fought at Prestonpans, and when the Prince went to England he\r\nand Angus Macdonell, Glengarry’s second son, were sent back to the\r\nHighlands to raise more men. Barisdale greatly disliked his first\r\ncousin Lochgarry, who commanded the Glengarry battalion, so he managed\r\nto raise a regiment of his own. (_Murray’s Mem._, pp. 280, 441.) He\r\nfought at Falkirk, but was not at Culloden, being absent on service in\r\nRoss-shire. In June he was captured and taken prisoner along with his\r\nson to Fort Augustus, and there he received a ten days’ protection on\r\ncondition of giving certain information to Government. For this he was\r\nseized by the Jacobites, carried prisoner to France, and confined at\r\nSt. Malo and Saumur for two years and four months; was not attainted in\r\n1746, but was excluded from the Act of Indemnity in 1747. He returned\r\nto Scotland in February 1749, but was again arrested by Government,\r\ntaken to Edinburgh Castle, and kept a close prisoner without trial\r\nuntil his death, 1st June 1750. A friendly account of this remarkable\r\nman will be found in the _History of Clan Donald_, iii. 337; and an\r\nunfriendly one in Mr. Lang’s _Companions of Pickle_, p. 97.\r\n\r\n_Youngest Barisdale_ was Coll’s eldest son, Archibald, who was not\r\nquite twenty years old at the beginning of the adventure. He acted\r\nas major of the Glengarry regiment. His name was included in the\r\nlist of attainders in 1746, apparently in mistake for his father. He\r\nwas made prisoner along with his father in 1746, first by Government\r\nand afterwards by the Jacobites; he was carried to France, where he\r\nwas held in durance for a year. He returned to Scotland, and in 1749\r\nwas again imprisoned by Government along with his father, but was\r\nimmediately released. Once more he was arrested in 1753, at the time\r\nwhen Dr. Archibald Cameron was taken and executed. Barisdale was tried\r\nand sentenced to death in March 1754, but reprieved. He was kept a\r\nprisoner until 1762, when he was finally released. At his own request\r\nhe at once took the oath of fealty to Government, and accepted a\r\ncommission in the 105th Regiment (the Queen’s Own Royal Highlanders),\r\nwhich was disbanded the following year. He died at Barisdale in 1787.\r\n\r\n[302] Captain in Cromartie’s regiment; was captured at Dunrobin; tried\r\nat Southwark in 1746, pleaded guilty and was condemned to death; he was\r\nnot executed; I am ignorant of his subsequent career.\r\n\r\n[303] Simon Fraser, b. 1726: after Culloden gave himself up to\r\nGovernment; attainted 1746, pardoned 1750; joined the Scottish bar\r\n1752; acted as Advocate-Depute in the Appin murder trial, an episode\r\nimmortalised in R. L. Stevenson’s _Catriona_; raised a Highland\r\nregiment for the Government 1757, and served with it under Wolfe in\r\nCanada (regiment disbanded 1763); M.P. Inverness 1761; family estates\r\nrestored to him 1774; raised a second regiment of two battalions 1775,\r\nfor the American War, which he did not accompany (regiment disbanded\r\n1783); died a lieut.-general 1782. Sir Walter Scott calls the Master\r\nof Lovat the good son of a bad father. A very different account is\r\ngiven by Mrs. Grant of Laggan--‘he differed from his father only as\r\na chain’d-up fox does from one at liberty.’ (See _Wariston’s Diary_,\r\netc., p. 275, Scot. Hist. Soc., vol. xxvi.)\r\n\r\n[304] Charles Fraser the younger, b. 1725, nephew and heir-presumptive\r\nof William Fraser of Inverallochy, Aberdeenshire, the senior cadet of\r\nLovat’s clan.\r\n\r\nHis father, Charles Fraser of Castle Fraser, younger brother of the\r\nlaird of Inverallochy, had inherited the property of Muchall or Castle\r\nFraser (Kemnay, Aberdeenshire), on the death of his step-grandfather\r\nCharles, 4th and last Lord Fraser, who lost his life near Banff by\r\nfalling over a precipice while in hiding to avoid capture after\r\nthe ’15. In 1723 the elder Charles Fraser was created ‘Lord Fraser\r\nof Mushall’ by the Chevalier in recognition of his services, and\r\nparticularly those of his father, ‘who died bravely asserting our\r\ncause, and in consideration of the earnest desire of the late Lord\r\nFraser, when we were last in Scotland, to resign his titles of honour\r\nin favour of the said Charles’ father.’ I am not aware of what these\r\nspecial services were, nor why the elder brother William was passed\r\nover both for the Castle Fraser inheritance and the Jacobite peerage.\r\nCharles Fraser eventually succeeded to Inverallochy in 1749 on the\r\ndeath of his brother William. He was probably too old to go out in\r\n1745, and his son went out as Lovat’s lieut.-colonel, ‘in accordance\r\nwith the ancient highland practice and the policy of Lord Lovat as\r\nbeing nearest in blood to the chiefship.’ Young Inverallochy was\r\nkilled at Culloden, and the story of his death is very painful. It\r\nis first told in a general way in _The Lyon_ (ii. 305; iii. 56), and\r\nafterwards with more detail by Sir Henry Seton Steuart of Allanton in\r\nthe _Antijacobin Review_ of 1802 (p. 125) as follows:--\r\n\r\n‘When the celebrated General Wolfe (at this period a lieut.-colonel\r\nin the army) was riding over the field of battle with the D----\r\nof C-m-b-l-d, they observed a Highlander, who, though severely\r\nwounded, was yet able to sit up, and, leaning on his arm, seemed to\r\nsmile defiance of them.--“Wolfe,” said the D----, “_shoot_ me that\r\nHighland scoundrel, who thus dares to look on us with such contempt\r\nand insolence!”--“My commission,” replied the manly officer, “is at\r\nyour R----l H----s’s disposal, but I never can consent to become an\r\n_executioner_.” The Highlander, it is probable, was soon knocked on\r\nthe head by some ruffian less scrupulous than the future conqueror of\r\nQuebec. But it was remarked by those who heard the story, that Colonel\r\nWolfe, from that day, visibly declined in the favour and confidence of\r\nthe commander-in-chief. We believe that some officers are still alive\r\nwho are not unacquainted with this anecdote.’\r\n\r\nMr. Beckles Willson, Wolfe’s latest biographer, accepts the story as\r\nregards Wolfe but doubts its applicability to Cumberland. Wolfe, it\r\nmust be remembered, was on Hawley’s staff, not Cumberland’s. These\r\ngenerals could easily have been mistaken for each other. The action\r\nis very like Hawley, who was hated by the soldiers, who nicknamed him\r\nthe Hangman, and who held his military talents in contempt, a feeling\r\nshared by Wolfe. Moreover, it was a Jacobite cult to vilify the Duke,\r\nand to impute all cruelties to him personally. Seton Steuart was not an\r\nentirely unprejudiced writer; he had been brought up in an atmosphere\r\nof uncompromising Jacobitism. He was a cousin of Sir James Steuart of\r\nGoodtrees and of Provost Stewart of Edinburgh, both of whom suffered;\r\nwhile his wife was grand-daughter of Charles Smith of Boulogne, the\r\nJacobite agent frequently mentioned in Murray’s Papers. (See _ante_, p.\r\n11.)\r\n\r\n[305] James Fraser, 9th of Foyers (Lochness), descended from the 3rd\r\nLord Lovat, was one of the most ruthless and devoted henchmen of Lovat,\r\nwho made him bailie of Stratherrick. He received from Prince Charles\r\na special commission, dated 23rd September 1745, to seize President\r\nDuncan Forbes and carry him prisoner to Edinburgh, an enterprise which\r\nfailed. His name was excluded from the act of indemnity, but he was\r\nafterwards pardoned and his estates restored. It was to his house that\r\nJohn Murray of Broughton was carried the day before Culloden.\r\n\r\n[306] _N.B._--Most of the Chisholms are Papists.\r\n\r\n[307] This does not quite accord with the clan history. Roderick, the\r\nchief of Chisholm, was then forty-eight years old. What part he took\r\nin the Rising is not on record, but he was specially excluded from\r\nthe act of indemnity. His eldest son Alexander seems to have stayed\r\nat home; his second and third sons were officers in the Government\r\narmy, and fought under Cumberland at Culloden; his fourth son, who\r\nwas a physician in Inverness, afterwards provost, seems to have taken\r\nno part; his youngest son, Roderick Og, led out the clan; he ‘headed\r\nabout eighty of the Chisholms at the battle of Culloden, himself and\r\nthirty thereof were killed upon the field.’ (Mackenzie, _Hist. of the\r\nChisholms_.)\r\n\r\n[308] The laird was then Alexander Mackenzie, 6th of Fairburn.\r\nAccording to the Marquis d’Éguilles, French envoy to Prince Charles,\r\nFairburn’s wife was Barbara Gordon, of whom he gives the following\r\naccount in a despatch to his government: ‘Une fort jolie personne ...\r\ncelle-cy n’a pas banni son mari; mais malgré luy, elle a vendu ses\r\ndiamants et sa vaisselle pour lever des hommes. Elle a ramassé cent\r\ncinquante des plus braves du païs, qu’elle a joint à ceux de miladi\r\nSeaforth, sous la conduite de son beau-frère.’ (Cottin, _Un Protégé\r\nde Bachaumont_, p. 51.) The brother-in-law may be Coll Macdonell of\r\nBarisdale, who married her husband’s sister; or it may be Kenneth\r\nMackenzie her husband’s brother who although only a schoolboy was a\r\ncaptain in Barisdale’s regiment. (Lord Rosebery’s _List of Persons\r\nConcerned in the Rebellion_, p. 76.) This lady is not mentioned in the\r\ngenealogies of Alex. Mackenzie’s _Hist. of the Mackenzies_, which are,\r\nhowever, manifestly incomplete.\r\n\r\n[309] Alexander Macgillivray of Dunmaglas, the lieut.-colonel of Lady\r\nMackintosh’s regiment, and Gillise Macbain, Dalmagarrie, the major,\r\nwere both killed at Culloden.\r\n\r\n[310] _N.B._--The Laird of McIntosh got a Company in the Highland\r\nRegiment. He raised a full company and they all deserted except 8 or 9.\r\n\r\n[311] Anne, daughter of James Farquharson, 9th of Invercauld, and\r\nMargaret Murray, daughter of Lord James Murray, an uncle of Lord George\r\nMurray; b. 1723; d. 1787; m. Æneas Mackintosh 22nd of Mackintosh, who,\r\nthough a Jacobite peer, refused to join Prince Charles, preferring to\r\nserve that monarch who was able to pay him ‘half-a-guinea the day and\r\nhalf-a-guinea the morn.’ (Notes to _Waverley_, ch. xix.) The chief\r\nraised a company for King George with the result noted above, while\r\nhis lady raised the clan for Prince Charles. Of this lady we get the\r\nfollowing enthusiastic account by the Marquis d’Éguilles:--\r\n\r\n‘Elle aimoit éperdûment son mari qu’elle espéra longtems de gagner\r\nau Prince; mais, ayant appris qu’il s’étoit enfin engagé, avec le\r\nPrésident, à servir la maison d’Hanovre, elle ne voulut plus le voir.\r\n\r\n‘Elle ne s’en tint pas là: elle souleva une partie de ses vassaux, à la\r\nteste desquels elle mit un très-beau cousin qui, jusques-là, l’avoit\r\naimée inutilement. Mackintosh fut obligé de quitter son lit, sa maison\r\net ses terres. L’intrépide ladi, un pistolet d’une main et de l’argent\r\nde l’autre, parcourt le païs, menace, donne, promet, et, en moins de\r\nquinze jours, ramasse 600 hommes. Elle en avoit envoyé moitié à Fakirk,\r\nqui y arriva la veille de la bataille. Elle avoit retenu l’autre\r\nmoitié _pour se garder de son mari_ et de Loudoun qui, à Inverness,\r\nn’étoient qu’à trois lieues de son château. Le prince logea chez elle,\r\nà son passage. Elle s’offrit à luy avec la grâce et la noblesse d’une\r\ndivinité, car rien n’est si beau que cette femme. Elle luy présenta\r\ntoute sa petite armée qu’elle avoit rassemblée, et après avoir parlé\r\naux soldats de ce qu’ils devoient à la situation, aux droits et aux\r\nvertus de leur Prince, elle jura très-catégoriquement de casser la\r\ntête au premier qui s’en tourneroit, après avoir, à ses yeux, brûlé sa\r\nmaison et chassé sa famille.\r\n\r\n‘Au reste, elle a toujours passé, jusques icy, pour être très-modérée,\r\ntrès-sensée. C’est, icy, l’effet de la première éducation. Son père,\r\npris à la bataille de Preston en 1715, avoit resté longtems prisonnier,\r\net couru risque de la vie. Elle n’a pas vingt-deux ans. C’est elle qui\r\ndécouvrit le projet qu’avoit fait Macleod d’enlever le Prince, et, en\r\nvérité, c’est elle seule qui l’a fait échouer.’ (Cottin, p. 49.)\r\n\r\nThe last sentence refers to the incident known as ‘the Rout of Moy’\r\n(_post_, p. 108), when Lady Mackintosh’s thoughtful vigilance saved\r\nher Prince from imminent risk of capture. A month later (March 20th)\r\nher husband was taken prisoner at Dornoch by the Jacobites. Prince\r\nCharles sent the chief to his wife at Moy, saying that ‘he could not\r\nbe in better security or more honourably treated.’ This may have been\r\nthe occasion of the story told by Bishop Mackintosh to Chambers: the\r\nlady was jocularly known in the army as ‘Colonel Anne’; when her\r\nhusband was ushered into her presence she greeted him laconically with,\r\n‘Your servant, captain,’ to which he replied with equal brevity, ‘Your\r\nservant, colonel!’ After Culloden Lady Mackintosh was arrested at Moy\r\nand taken to Inverness; she was released after six weeks’ confinement.\r\nIn spite of her martial reputation, and her undaunted resolution, there\r\nwas nothing masculine about her appearance; she was a slender, rather\r\ndelicate-looking girl: she took no part in the fighting but remained\r\nat home during the campaign. In after years when in London, family\r\ntradition says that she became a favourite in certain royal circles,\r\nand there on one occasion she met the Duke of Cumberland, and with him\r\nshe exchanged some piquant raillery (see narratives in A. M. Shaw’s\r\n_Mackintoshes and Clan Chattan_, p. 464 _seq._).\r\n\r\n[312] Culcairn, now called Kincraig, in Rosskeen parish. George Munro,\r\nb. 1685, brother of Sir Robert Munro of Foulis (see _post_, p. 198).\r\nCulcairn was shot in Knoydart in August 1746 while wasting the country\r\nand carrying off cattle in company with Captain Grant of Knockando,\r\nof Loudoun’s Regiment. It is said he was shot by accident instead of\r\nGrant, by the father of one Alexander Cameron, whom Grant had shot a\r\nshort time previously. (_L. in M._, i. 91, 312.)\r\n\r\n[313] Cf. _ante_, p. 46 _n._\r\n\r\n[314] Kenneth (Mackenzie), eldest son of William, 5th Earl of Seaforth,\r\nattainted 1716, d. 1740; but for the attainder he would have been\r\n6th earl. He was styled Lord Fortrose, which was the second Jacobite\r\ntitle of his grandfather, created Marquis of Seaforth by James VII.\r\nafter his abdication. He was born about 1718; M.P. for Inverness\r\n1741-47; and for Ross-shire from 1747 until his death, 1761. Lord\r\nFortrose (who was generally, though not officially, called Seaforth\r\nin Scotland) adhered to Government in the ’45. Though his support was\r\nof the paltriest description, his defection gave great pain to Prince\r\nCharles. Fortrose’s wife was Lady Mary Stewart, daughter of the 6th\r\nEarl of Galloway. This lady raised men for Prince Charles, with the\r\nresult narrated in these pages. Of her the French envoy informs his\r\nGovernment: ‘On assure que son zèle égale celuy des deux autres [Lady\r\nMackintosh and Mrs. Mackenzie of Fairburn], quoy qu’elle paroisse\r\nmoins vive et moins courageuse.’ It was their son who raised the 1st\r\nBattalion Seaforth Highlanders (72nd), for which service he was created\r\nEarl of Seaforth in the Peerage of Ireland.\r\n\r\n[315] The Rosses of Ross-shire are rather mixed up here. At this time\r\nthere were two distinct races of Ross in the county, which should not\r\nbe confounded. The Celtic family of Ross, of whom the ancient head\r\nwas the Earl of Ross, was originally known as the clan Ghille-andrais\r\n(servants of St. Andrew). The earldom passed by marriage of heiresses\r\nin the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, first to the Leslies and\r\nafterwards to the Macdonalds, Lords of the Isles. The chiefship of the\r\nclan, however, went to the heir male, Ross of Balnagowan. In the year\r\n1711, David Ross, the last of the Celtic family of Balnagowan, died.\r\nThe natural heir was Ross of Pitcalnie, his next of kin. Pitcalnie was\r\na Roman Catholic or Episcopalian, anyhow he was not a Presbyterian,\r\nand Balnagowan was influenced by his wife, Lady Anne (daughter of the\r\n4th Earl of Moray), a bigoted Presbyterian, to disinherit the natural\r\nheir and bequeath the property to General the Hon. Charles Ross,\r\na younger son of George, 11th Lord Ross of Halkhead, in Ayrshire.\r\n(Fraser-Mackintosh, _Antiq. Notes_, p. 66.) The family which thus\r\nbecame Ross of Balnagowan had no connection with the Celtic clan of the\r\nsame name, but was descended from a Norman family named de Ros. In 1745\r\nBalnagowan with its great territorial influence had come to George,\r\n13th Lord Ross, and the Master of Ross his eldest son (afterwards 14th\r\nand last Lord Ross) received the command of one of the independent\r\ncompanies raised in 1745. He was garrisoning Inverness Castle (then\r\ncalled Fort George) when it was captured by the Jacobites, 20th Feb.\r\n’46; he remained a prisoner on parole until the end of the campaign.\r\nHe was one of the very few officers who did not break his parole. (Cf.\r\n_post_, pp. 207, 364.)\r\n\r\nThe Rosses of Inverchasley and Pitcalnie, who belonged to the ancient\r\nCeltic clan Ghille-andrais, sided with the Government, but ‘young\r\nPitcalnie,’ Malcolm Ross, who was a grand-nephew of President Duncan\r\nForbes, went over to the Jacobites. He had served as ensign in\r\nLoudoun’s regiment at Prestonpans, where he was taken prisoner by\r\nthe Jacobites and released on parole. He seems to have been the only\r\nGovernment officer who deserted to the Jacobites. His name was included\r\nin the list of attainders.\r\n\r\n[316] Macleod of Geanies was representative of the Macleods of Assynt\r\n(see _ante_, p. 74). John, a brother of Neil Macleod (tried for the\r\nbetrayal of Montrose), left Assynt and settled in Easter Ross where his\r\nson Donald, an officer in the Scots Brigade in Holland, purchased the\r\nestate of Geanies. Donald’s son Hugh was laird in 1745; his wife was a\r\nniece of President Duncan Forbes of Culloden.\r\n\r\n[317] See _post_, p. 143 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[318] This refers to the fiasco known as the ‘Rout of Moy’ (16th Feb.\r\n’46), when by a stratagem, a blacksmith and a few other retainers of\r\nLady Mackintosh, made Loudoun believe that the whole Jacobite army was\r\nupon him; he fled back to Inverness, whence he retreated across the\r\nKessock Ferry to Ross-shire. The principal, perhaps the only, victim of\r\nthe expedition, was Donald Ban MacCrimmon, Macleod’s famous piper, who\r\nwas shot by the blacksmith. Cf. _post_, p. 145. (For details, see Home,\r\n_Hist. Reb._, ch. ix.; _L. in M._, 149, etc.)\r\n\r\n[319] George Grant of Culbin, brother of Sir James Grant of Grant,\r\nmajor in the Highland Regiment (Black Watch). He surrendered Inverness\r\nCastle (then called Fort George) to Prince Charles, 20th February, for\r\nwhich he was subsequently tried by court-martial, and dismissed the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n[320] See _ante_, p. 75.\r\n\r\n[321] Now called Strathavon (pronounced Stratha’an), Banffshire. It\r\nis generally called Strathdawn or Strathdown in documents of this\r\ndate; perhaps from the local pronunciation, plus the archaic ‘d’ which\r\noccasionally appears in place-names, _e.g._ Strathdearn for the valley\r\nof the Earn or Findhorn. There was an ancient church of Dounan in the\r\nvalley perhaps from the same root.\r\n\r\n[322] George Forbes of Skeleter; m. Glenbucket’s daughter Christiana\r\nGordon. He escaped to France after Culloden, joined Lord Ogilvie’s\r\nScots regiment in the French service: he never returned.\r\n\r\n[323] William (Duff) of Braco and Dipple; b. 1697; d. 1763; M.P.\r\nBanffshire 1727-34; created Baron Braco of Kilbride 1735; and in 1759\r\nViscount Macduff and Earl Fife--all these titles being in the peerage\r\nof Ireland; m. (1) Janet, d. of 4th Earl of Findlater; and (2) Jean,\r\nd. of Sir James Grant of Grant. He, his father, and his grandfather\r\nmade enormous purchases of land in Aberdeen, Banff, and Moray shires,\r\nparticularly on the forfeitures after Mar’s rising in 1715. He joined\r\nCumberland in 1746.\r\n\r\n[324] Among the Jacobite prisoners who pled guilty is ‘Robert\r\nForbes, printer, son to New.’ (_Scots Mag._, viii. p. 438.) At his\r\ntrial it is stated that he was a farmer. His home was at Corse in\r\nthe parish of Coull, Deeside. He was captain in one of Lord Lewis\r\nGordon’s battalions, and was one of the officers left at Carlisle and\r\ncaptured there. He was sentenced to death but was not executed; of his\r\nsubsequent career I have no knowledge.\r\n\r\n[325] Cope reached Aberdeen 11th Sept., and left it by sea 15th Sept.\r\n1745.\r\n\r\n[326] Johnshaven, a fishing port on the Kincardine coast, about\r\ntwenty-five miles south of Aberdeen; Torry and Foothy (Footdee),\r\nfishing villages near the mouth of the Dee, Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n[327] James Moir of Stonywood, an estate on Donside three miles above\r\nAberdeen. He was very active in the Jacobite cause, and while the\r\nPrince was in England raised a battalion, of which Lord Lewis Gordon\r\nwas titular colonel. After Culloden he escaped to Sweden, where he\r\nresided until 1762, when he was permitted to return to Stonywood. He\r\ndied in 1782. His correspondence in 1745-46 is printed in the _Spalding\r\nClub Misc._, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[328] York Street cadys = messenger-porters of a low street in Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n[329] Francis Farquharson of Monaltrie, near Ballater on the Dee, the\r\n‘Baron ban’ of the ’45, raised a regiment from Deeside and Braemar.\r\nHe was made prisoner at Culloden, tried at London, and condemned to\r\ndeath, but reprieved. He was kept prisoner in England, latterly with\r\nconsiderable liberty at Berkhampstead, Herts. He was liberated in\r\n1766, and returned to Monaltrie, where he devoted the rest of his\r\nlife to improving the social and material condition of his country.\r\nHe introduced into Aberdeenshire improved methods of farming, which\r\nhe had carefully studied while in exile in England. His name is still\r\ncherished in the county as the man who did much to make Aberdeen the\r\ngreat farming county it became. He died in 1791.\r\n\r\n[330] The Duke of Perth had twice to flee from Drummond Castle; first\r\nin March 1744, immediately after the failure of the projected French\r\ninvasion. A party of 36 dragoons and 150 foot was sent from Stirling\r\nunder Lieut.-Col. Whitney (afterwards killed at Falkirk) to surround\r\nthe castle, but the Duke escaped (_Chron. Atholl and Tullib._, ii.\r\n473). The second time was in July 1745, referred to _post_, p. 271,\r\n_n._ 2. This occasion was a treacherous attempt of his neighbour, Sir\r\nPatrick Murray of Ochtertyre, and Campbell of Inverawe, both officers\r\nof the Highland regiment (Black Watch), to capture him while dining at\r\nDrummond Castle. The story is detailed in _The Lyon_, i. 290.\r\n\r\n[331] Now spelt Balmoral, the King’s home on Deeside. The laird was\r\nbadly wounded at Falkirk and took no further part in the campaign.\r\n\r\n[332] Hamilton’s home was Sanstoun, now called Huntly Lodge, beside\r\nold Huntly Castle. He was left governor of Carlisle when the Jacobite\r\narmy left it on their way south (21st Nov.), and on their return in\r\nDecember Hamilton was made governor of the Castle, while Towneley, an\r\nEnglishman, was left governor of the town. Carlisle surrendered to\r\nCumberland 30th December. Both Towneley and Hamilton were hanged on\r\nKennington Common. (See also _post_, p. 173.)\r\n\r\n[333] His home was Dunbennan, close to Huntly; the whole ‘toun’ was\r\nburnt down in 1746.\r\n\r\n[334] James Petrie, advocate in Aberdeen; joined the local bar 1743;\r\nappointed sheriff-depute 8th May 1744. The last deed ascertained to\r\nhave been lodged before him is dated 23rd September 1745. Petrie went\r\ninto hiding after the ’45. As he was not specially excluded from\r\nthe Act of Indemnity of 1747, he was able to resume practice at the\r\nAberdeen bar by taking the oath of allegiance, which he did in April\r\n1748.

He acted as deputy-governor of Aberdeen during the Jacobite\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\n[338] Mary (Hay), Countess of Erroll in her own right, the last of the\r\nHays of Erroll. She married Alexander Falconer, but left no issue.\r\nOn her death in 1758, she was succeeded in the Errol title by James\r\n(Boyd), Lord Boyd (son of the Earl of Kilmarnock, executed in 1746),\r\nwhose mother was the daughter and sole heiress of Lady Erroll’s sister\r\nMargaret, wife of the attainted Earl of Linlithgow and Callander. He\r\nassumed the name of Hay.\r\n\r\n[339] George (Gordon), 3rd earl; b. 1722; suc. his father 30th March\r\n1745; d. 1801. His mother was Lady Anna Murray (d. 1725), a sister of\r\nLord George Murray; his stepmother, Lady Anne Gordon, sister of Lord\r\nLewis Gordon. The Duchess of Gordon was his sister.\r\n\r\n[340] James (Ogilvy), 5th earl; b. 1689; suc. 1730; d. 1764. He had\r\nbeen imprisoned in 1715, on the outbreak of Mar’s rising.\r\n\r\n[341] John (Keith), 3rd earl; b. 1699; suc. 1718; d. 1772. His wife was\r\na d. of Erskine of Grange, Lord Mar’s brother. His father, 2nd earl,\r\nwas out in ’15.\r\n\r\n[342] James (Forbes), 16th lord; b. 1689; suc. 1734; d. 1761. His first\r\nwife was sister of Lord Pitsligo; his second wife, a sister of Sir Wm.\r\nGordon of Park, both ardent Jacobite leaders.\r\n\r\n[343] Alexander (Fraser), 12th lord; b. c. 1684; suc. 1715; d. 1748.\r\n‘He was a supporter of the Hanoverian Government, but took no active\r\npart in public affairs.’ (_Scots Peerage_, vii. 446.)\r\n\r\n[344] See _ante_, p. 113, _n._ 3.\r\n\r\n[345] Buchan, northern Aberdeenshire and part of eastern Banffshire;\r\nFormartine, the district south of Buchan, between the sea and the Don.\r\n\r\n[346] The laird of Leys was then Sir Alexander Burnett, 4th bart.; d.\r\n1758.\r\n\r\n[347] Rev. George Law, of Aberdeen; acted as chaplain to Stonywood’s\r\nregiment; made prisoner at Culloden; tried at Southwark in December,\r\nand acquitted. I am not aware of any active part taken by Seaton. It\r\nis mentioned that the French officers were made burghers of Aberdeen\r\nin December, and that Seaton received a similar honour; also that in\r\nFebruary his lodging was ransacked and ‘some papers, mistically written\r\nfor five or six years back, found.’ (_Spald. Club. Misc._, i. 360 and\r\n385.)\r\n\r\n[348] Fourth son of Alexander, 2nd Duke of Gordon; b. _c._ 1724;\r\nlieutenant in the Navy, but joined Prince Charles at Edinburgh. Was\r\nappointed by him Lord-Lieut. of Banff and Aberdeen shires. Escaped\r\nafter Culloden, and died at Montreuil, 1754.\r\n\r\n[349] At Fountainhall, East Lothian, twelve miles from Edinburgh.\r\nThe Duchess was Henrietta Mordaunt, daughter of the celebrated Earl\r\nof Peterborough. On her husband’s death in 1728, she brought up her\r\nnumerous children as Protestants, though her husband’s family was\r\nhereditarily Catholic. For this she received, in 1735, a pension of\r\n£1000 a year, which it is said she forfeited for entertaining Prince\r\nCharles to breakfast on the roadside as he passed her gates. Her son,\r\nthe 3rd duke, took no active part in the ’45, but his influence was\r\nagainst his brother and the Jacobites. He seems to have remained in\r\nGordon Castle down to March, but he left it on the 8th, ‘in the most\r\nsecret manner he could,’ probably to avoid meeting Prince Charles, who\r\nvisited the castle a few days later. The Duke then joined Cumberland in\r\nAberdeen. (_S.M._, viii. 138.)\r\n\r\n[350] William Baird (b. 1701; d. 1777) of Auchmeddan, in the\r\nAberdeenshire parish of Aberdour, on the borders of Banff, the last\r\nof an ancient family, of which the baroneted families of New Byth and\r\nSaughton are cadets. His wife was a sister of the 1st Earl Fife, then\r\nLord Braco. He was author of a genealogical history of the Bairds\r\n(reprinted, London, 1870) and another of the Duffs, which was privately\r\nprinted in 1869.\r\n\r\n[351] Charles Gordon of Blelack, near Aboyne, Deeside.\r\n\r\n[352] A district of Aberdeenshire, south of Strathbogie and south-west\r\nof Formartine, comprising the valleys of the Urie and the Gadie.\r\n\r\n[353] Lord John Drummond landed a force of about 800 men, composed of\r\nhis own French regiments of Royal Scots and a piquet of fifty men from\r\neach of the six Irish regiments in the French service. They landed on\r\n22nd November at Montrose, Stonehaven, and Peterhead. Two of Drummond’s\r\ntransports were captured by English men-of-war; among the prisoners so\r\ntaken was Alexander Macdonell, ‘Young Glengarry,’ Mr. Lang’s Pickle the\r\nSpy.\r\n\r\n[354] These were Lord John Drummond, brother of the titular Duke\r\nof Perth, and Lord Lewis Drummond. The latter (1709-92), the\r\nlieut.-colonel of Lord John Drummond’s French Royal Scots, was the\r\nsecond son of John (Drummond), 2nd (but attainted) Earl of Melfort,\r\nwhose father had been created Duke of Melfort by James VII. while in\r\nexile in 1692, and Duke of Melfort in the French peerage by Louis XIV.\r\nin 1701. Lord Lewis lost a leg at Culloden. He died in Paris, 1792.\r\n\r\n[355] These manifestoes are printed _post_, pp. 292, 293.\r\n\r\nJohn Haliburton was an officer in the French service; he arrived at\r\nInverness with despatches two days before the battle of Culloden.\r\n(_Murray’s Mem._, p. 433.) After Culloden he assisted in the\r\ndistribution of the money (of which Cluny’s treasure was a part) landed\r\nby the French ships at Lochnanuagh in May 1746. (_Albemarle Papers_, p.\r\n338.)\r\n\r\n[356] This highland dress for lowland men is detailed by Lord Lewis\r\nGordon to Stonywood as ‘plaid, short cloaths, hose, and shoes.’\r\n(_Spald.

Raised a regiment of Highlanders in 1745 (disbanded 1748).\r\nAdjutant-general to Sir John Cope at Prestonpans; sent to Inverness\r\nto command the troops in the North, October 1745; commander-in-chief\r\nin America 1756, but recalled the same year; general, and colonel 3rd\r\n(Scots) Guards 1770.\r\n\r\n[358] ‘_Order of the Rt. Hon. the Ld. Lewis Gordon, lord-lieutenant\r\nof the counties, and governor of the towns of Aberdeen and\r\nBamff._--Whereas I desired and ordered J.

Scots, their valued rent, sufficiently\r\ncloathed, and in consequence of my order he wrote circular letters to\r\nall the heritors in the above counties, desiring them to send in a man\r\nsufficiently cloathed, &c. for each 100l. Scots of their valued rent;\r\nwhich desire they have not complied with: Therefore I order and command\r\nyou, to take a sufficient party of my men, and go to all the lands\r\nwithin the above counties, and require from the heritors, factors, or\r\ntenants, as you shall think most proper, an able-bodied man for his\r\nm---- K---- J----’s service, with sufficient Highland cloaths, plaid\r\nand arms, for each 100l. of their valued rent, or the sum of 5l. sterl.\r\nmoney for each of the above men, to be paid to J.

He was a captain in Lord\r\nJohn Drummond’s French regiment of Royal Scots. After Culloden he\r\nwas treated as a prisoner of war. By 1749 he had become lieut.-col.\r\nof the regiment. (_L. in M._, ii. 286.) The laird of Castlehill was\r\nSheriff-depute of Inverness-shire, and was not a Jacobite.\r\n\r\n[362] Highland squatters. ‘Humly’ is the ordinary north-country term\r\nfor hornless cattle. Robert Jamieson in a note to Letter XXII. in the\r\n5th edition of Burt’s _Letters from the North of Scotland_, published\r\nin 1818, says: ‘In the days of our grandfathers the lower class of\r\nhighlanders were, by their lowland neighbours (in the north-east\r\nlowlands at least), denominated _humblies_, from their wearing no\r\ncovering on their head but their hair, which at a more early period\r\nthey probably matted and felted.’\r\n\r\n[363] Donald Ban MacCrimmon, of the celebrated race of hereditary\r\npipers to the chiefs of Macleod. This is the only mention I can recall\r\nof this pleasant story of his relations with his brother musicians.\r\nThere is an exceedingly picturesque account (perhaps more picturesque\r\nthan authentic) of MacCrimmon’s descent from a musician of Cremona,\r\ngiven in the _Celtic Review_, ii. 76, 1906. Though MacCrimmon escaped\r\ndeath at Inverurie, he was killed in the fiasco at Moy on 16th\r\nFebruary. (See _ante_, p. 108.)\r\n\r\nWhen leaving Dunvegan for the anti-Jacobite campaign of ’45-’46, he had\r\na presentiment that he would never return, and composed the words and\r\nmusic of a celebrated lament, which was translated or paraphrased by\r\nSir Walter Scott:--\r\n\r\n    Farewell to each cliff on which breakers are foaming,\r\n    Farewell each dark glen in which red-deer are roaming,\r\n    Farewell, lonely Skye, to lake, mountain, and river,\r\n    Macleod may return, but MacCrimmon shall never.\r\n\r\n    The Banshee’s wild voice sings the death dirge before me,\r\n    And the pall of the dead for a mantle hangs o’er me;\r\n    But my heart shall not fly, and my nerve shall not quiver,\r\n    Though devoted I go--to return again, never!\r\n\r\n\r\n[364] Sir Alexander Bannerman, 3rd bart., of Elsick, Kincardineshire\r\n(the Mearns). His mother was a Macdonald of Sleat. He escaped to\r\nFrance; died in Paris 1747.\r\n\r\n[365] This seems to be a mistake. Lord Ogilvie’s regiment marched\r\nto the north through Ogilvie’s country from Perth, by Cupar Angus,\r\nCortachy, Clova, Glenmuick, Logie Colston, and Tarland, to Keith.\r\n(_Spalding Club Misc._, i. 332.)\r\n\r\n[366] ‘Kelly’s’ probably means John Roy Stewart’s regiment, which was\r\noriginally intended for the Earl of Kellie.\r\n\r\n[367] Now spelt Clatt. Rev. Patrick Reid; ord. 1723; d. 1759.\r\n\r\n[368] John Baggot, a Franco-Irishman, commanded the Prince’s Hussars\r\n(raised at Edinburgh), of which John Murray of Broughton was titular\r\ncolonel. By the French Ambassador he is returned after Culloden as\r\n‘_blessé assez considérablement mais sans danger de la vie_.’ (Cottin,\r\n_Un Protégé de Bachaumont_, p. 62.)\r\n\r\n[369] Rev. William Taylor; ord. 1737; d. 1797, aged eighty-nine.\r\n\r\n[370] On 22nd Feb., three troops (about 130 men) of Fitzjames’s\r\nregiment of horse landed at Aberdeen from France but without horses.\r\nThere was great difficulty in mounting the men. Kilmarnock’s horse\r\n(sometimes called Strathallan’s, or the Perthshire Squadron) were\r\ndismounted and the horses given to the French cavalry, while the\r\nmen were formed into foot-guards. By this time, says Maxwell of\r\nKirkconnell, Pitsligo’s horse was dwindled away to nothing, and many of\r\nits members had joined infantry corps. Two of Fitzjames’s transports,\r\nthe _Bourbon_ and the _Charité_, with 359 of all ranks, including the\r\nComte de Fitzjames, were captured by English cruisers.\r\n\r\n[371] On 21st Feb. a picquet of 42 men of Berwick’s (French) regiment\r\nlanded at Peterhead.\r\n\r\n[372] I can trace no record of this landing. It may refer to Berwick’s\r\npicquets (see p. 151), or it may be a mistake.\r\n\r\n[373] William Henry (Ker) (1710-75), afterwards 4th Marquess of\r\nLothian; captain 1st Guards (Grenadiers) 1741; aide-de-camp to\r\nCumberland at Fontenoy; lieut.-colonel in Lord Mark Ker’s Dragoons\r\n(11th Hussars) 1745; commanded the cavalry of the left wing at\r\nCulloden. His brother, Lord Robert Ker, a captain in Barrel’s regiment,\r\nwas killed in the battle.\r\n\r\n[374] Humphrey Bland (1686-1763), author of _A Treatise on Discipline_.\r\nAt this time he was a major-general and colonel of the dragoon regiment\r\nnow the 3rd Hussars. He was governor of Edinburgh Castle from 1752 till\r\nhis death. He became Commander-in-Chief in Scotland in 1753.\r\n\r\n[375] Probably a mistake for lieut.-colonel (the command is too great\r\nfor a subaltern’s), and evidently means Robert Rich (1714-85), son of\r\nField-Marshal Sir Robert Rich, whom he succeeded as 5th bart. in 1768.\r\nRich was at this time lieut.-colonel of Barrel’s regiment the 4th (now\r\nthe K. O. Royal Lancaster regiment). At Culloden Rich was badly wounded\r\nand lost his hand.\r\n\r\n[376] See _post_, p. 307.\r\n\r\n[377] Probably means ‘light-footed laddies.’ Cf. _Oxford Dict._, s.v.\r\n‘leger.’\r\n\r\n[378] Robert Hunter of Burnside, Monifieth, was captain in the Prince’s\r\nLife-Guards, and was very active throughout the campaign. He escaped\r\nto Bergen in Norway after Culloden, and for a time was held prisoner\r\nthere, but apparently soon released, for in October he is on French\r\nKing’s pension list for 1800 livres as a ‘_gentilhomme eccossois arrivé\r\ndepuis peu en France_.’\r\n\r\n[379] This took place on 17th March. The officer commanding the\r\nJacobite party was Major Nicolas Glascoe, a lieutenant in Dillon’s\r\nIrish-French regiment. He acted as major and military instructor to\r\nthe 2nd battalion of Lord Ogilvie’s regiment. He was made prisoner\r\nafter Culloden, and tried at London in November, but pleading that he\r\nwas born in France and held a French commission, he was released as a\r\nrebel, the irons were knocked off his legs, and he was treated as a\r\nprisoner of war.\r\n\r\n[380] The husbands of these ladies were all in the Jacobite army.\r\n\r\n[381] Cullen House was the home of Lord Findlater.\r\n\r\n[382] William Thornton, of Thornville, near Knaresborough, raised\r\nand equipped a company, known as the ‘Yorkshire Blues,’ at his own\r\nexpense in October 1745. He joined Wade’s army at Newcastle, and\r\nhis company was attached to Pulteney’s regiment (13th, now Prince\r\nAlbert’s Own Somersetshire Light Infantry), which was below strength.\r\nHis henchman and servant was John Metcalf, better known as ‘Blind\r\nJack of Knaresborough,’ afterwards celebrated as a civil engineer\r\nand maker of roads, but at this time a horse-coper and itinerant\r\nmusician. At Falkirk the company served as escort to the artillery\r\nwhich covered itself with disgrace. Blind Jack fought at the battle\r\nin which his master and Lieutenant Crofts were taken prisoners. After\r\nthe battle Blind Jack retreated to Edinburgh along with the remains\r\nof the company, now reduced to forty-eight from an original strength\r\nof sixty-four. In a quaint little book, _The Life of John Metcalf_\r\n(3rd edition, Leeds, 1802), there is a long and graphic account of\r\nhow this blind man succeeded in rescuing his master. Donning a ‘plaid\r\nwaist-coat,’ the Jacobite uniform, he made his way from Edinburgh to\r\nthe battle field, where among the marauders hunting for plunder he\r\nfound the wife of Lord George Murray’s cook, who gave him ‘a token’ for\r\nher husband. Giving out that he wished to be employed as a musician\r\nto Prince Charles, he made his way to Lord George Murray’s quarters\r\nat Falkirk, where that General gave him a glass of wine, and he had\r\na conversation with several of the Jacobite leaders. Confined on\r\nsuspicion for some days, he was acquitted by a court-martial. Finding\r\nhis captain, he had him disguised as a Highlander and managed to escape\r\nwith him. How Crofts and Simson escaped I do not know. The rev. ensign\r\nwas Patrick Simson, minister of Fala, near Dalkeith (b. 1713; ord.\r\n1743; transferred to Clunie, Dunkeld, 1759; d. 1771). How he joined\r\nThornton’s ‘Blues’ I do not know; one would rather have expected to\r\nfind him in the Glasgow regiment (see _post_, p. 198). The original\r\nensign of the company had died at Newcastle, and Thornton may have\r\nappointed Simson when in Edinburgh. Simson had the reputation of being\r\na sportsman, particularly an angler. (Scott, _Fasti_.) The _Dict. of\r\nNat. Biog._ says that Blind Jack fought at Culloden, but it is not so\r\nstated in the life quoted above, and if this passage is correct it\r\nprecludes the possibility. There is no mention in the _Life_ of this\r\nincident at Ellon, nor any account of the company leaving the army.\r\n\r\n[383] Cumberland left Aberdeen on April 8th.\r\n\r\n[384] Meaning ‘a verminous swarm of red-coats.’\r\n\r\n[385] A very considerable list of houses burnt in Aberdeen and Banff\r\nshires is given in the _Lyon in Mourning_, ii. 334, 335.\r\n\r\n[386] ‘_By the Earl of Ancrum, Aid de Camp to His Majesty, and\r\ncommanding the forces on the Eastern coast of North-Britain._ Whereas\r\narms have been found in several houses, contrary to his Royal Highness\r\nthe Duke’s proclamation, this is therefore to give notice, That\r\nwhere-ever arms of any kind are found, that the house, and all houses\r\nbelonging to the proprietor or his tenants, shall be immediately burnt\r\nto ashes; and that as some arms have been found under ground, that if\r\nany shall be discovered for the future, the adjacent houses and fields\r\nshall be immediately laid waste and destroyed.’\r\n\r\n[_Lord Loudoun’s orders_]:--‘Whereas great part of the King’s arms\r\nbelonging to the regiment commanded by the Rt. Hon. the Earl of Loudon,\r\nwere taken away by the rebels in Sutherland, and by them distributed to\r\npeople of different parts of the country; who, notwithstanding the many\r\norders published by his Royal Highness the Duke, still detain them in\r\ntheir possession: These are to advertise such as do not deliver them\r\nin to the storehouse at Inverness, or to the commanding officer of any\r\npart of his Majesty’s forces who happens to be in their neighbourhood,\r\nby the first day of August, that the possessors where-ever they are\r\nfound, whether civil or military, and of what rank soever, shall be\r\nprosecuted with the utmost rigour, as the law in that case directs.’\r\n\r\n[387] This was an incident that occasioned fierce indignation in\r\nAberdeen. August 1st was the date of the accession of the Hanoverian\r\ndynasty. Lord Ancram ordered the bells to be rung and the houses\r\nto be illuminated. It had not been the custom to illuminate, and\r\nthe magistrates only ordered the bells to be rung. The soldiers\r\nof Fleming’s regiment (36th, now the Worcestershire), egged on by\r\ntheir officers, broke the windows, stoned the inhabitants, and did\r\ndamage to the extent of £130, a large sum in those days to a town of\r\nthe size of Aberdeen. In spite of the pretensions of the military\r\nauthorities, who maintained that they were not liable to the civil\r\ngovernment, the magistrates arrested a Captain Morgan and other\r\nofficers, who were ringleaders in the riot. Morgan had been very\r\nactive in hunting fugitive Jacobites, and his commanding officer, who\r\ncalls Aberdeen ‘this infamous town,’ attributes his arrest to this\r\ncause. Representations were made to the Lord Justice-Clerk and to\r\nLord Albemarle, the Commander-in-chief in Scotland, who both took a\r\nserious view of the case, the former writing to the latter that ‘the\r\nofficers in the army were trampling on those very laws that they so\r\nlately defended at the expence of their blood.’ Ancram was rebuked\r\nby Albemarle, and removed from Aberdeen; though the trouble still\r\nsmouldered it was temporarily patched up. (_Alb. Pap._, p. 27 _seq._;\r\n_Scots Mag._, viii. 393.) Six months later the regiment left Aberdeen,\r\nmarching out (it is said) to the tune ‘We’ll gang nae mair to yon\r\ntoun.’ Cf. _post_, p. 189.\r\n\r\n[388] Hugh (Abercromby-Sempill), fifth son of Anne, Baroness Sempill,\r\nand Francis Abercromby of Fetterneir. Succeeded his brother as 11th\r\nLord Sempill 1727; served at Malplaquet, 1709, as an ensign; succeeded\r\nLord Crawford as colonel of the Highland Regiment (Black Watch), 1741;\r\ncolonel of the 25th (K. O. Scottish Borderers) 1745; brigadier-general\r\n1745; commanded the left wing at Culloden; superseded Lord Ancram at\r\nAberdeen 12th August, 1746; and died there 25th November following.\r\n\r\n[389] Should be 25th; Sunday 24th was spent at Kendal, and Lancaster\r\nwas reached the following day. (_L. in M._, ii. 120, 193.)\r\n\r\n[390] I have little doubt that this name is a mistake for Geohagan, an\r\nIrishman, captain in Lally’s regiment, to whom, Lord Elcho states, the\r\nPrince gave a commission to raise an English regiment. The officers\r\nof the army remonstrated, and the commission was withdrawn. (Elcho,\r\n_Affairs of Scotland_, p. 327.) Geohagan was one of the French officers\r\ntaken prisoner at Carlisle.\r\n\r\n[391] Not identified.\r\n\r\n[392] David Morgan was a Welshman from Monmouthshire, a\r\nbarrister-at-law. He joined the Prince at Preston on 27th November,\r\nalong with William Vaughan and Francis Towneley, all being from\r\nWales. When at Derby it was determined to return to Scotland Morgan\r\nrefused to go, saying, ‘it were better to be hanged in England than\r\nstarved in Scotland’ (_Tales of a Grandfather_). He left the army at\r\nAshbourne, on 6th December, to go to London to procure intelligence,\r\nwith the knowledge and consent of the Prince and of Sheridan (_Murray’s\r\nMemorials_, 434). At his trial he pled that he had escaped as soon as\r\nit was in his power, but this plea was repelled. He was executed at\r\nKennington Common on 30th July, along with Towneley, and seven other\r\nEnglish officers. Morgan is thus described in the _Compleat History of\r\nthe Trials of the Rebels_ (p. 170): ‘David Morgan was about 51 Years\r\nof Age, born in Wales, and bred to the Law, and had frequently (as a\r\nBarrister) attended the Courts at Westminster-Hall, and elsewhere. He\r\nwas a Person of a very mean Look, and seldom kept Company with any\r\nGentlemen of his Neighbourhood; and if it had not been for his Estate,\r\nhe might have starv’d, for he was so very lofty, and of so bad a\r\nTemper, that no body but such as were beholden to him cared to employ\r\nhim. This Morgan was possessed of a very good Estate in St. Leonard’s,\r\nShoreditch, but he let it all run to Ruin, because he would not pay\r\nthe Ground-Rent. The Rebels call’d Morgan the Pretender’s Counsellor,\r\nand his Advice was consulted on every Occasion. Even after he was\r\ncondemn’d, he was haughty and insolent beyond expression; and the\r\nvery Afternoon before his Execution, he grumbled to pay the Cook who\r\ndress’d his Dinner, and said she was very extravagant in her Demands.\r\nThe Morning (about Six o’Clock) before he went to Execution, he order’d\r\nCoffee to be made, and bid them take Care to make it very good and\r\nstrong, for he had never drank any since he had been in that Prison\r\nfit to come near a Gentleman; and because it was ready before he was\r\nunlock’d, he seem’d angry, and in a great Passion.’\r\n\r\nMorgan was the author of a rather dull satirical political poem of 630\r\nverses, entitled _The Country Bard or the Modern Courtiers, inscribed\r\nto H.R.H. the Prince of Wales_, a quarto originally printed in 1741,\r\nand republished in 1746 after his execution. It is prefaced by a\r\ndedicatory letter to Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, the Welsh Jacobite\r\nbaronet. In his dying declaration, handed to the sheriff on the\r\nscaffold, Morgan writes that he is a member of the Church of England,\r\nand that he has fully set forth his faith in a poem of two books\r\nentitled _The Christian Test or the Coalition of Faith and Reason_, the\r\nfirst of which he had already published, and the latter he bequeathed\r\nto his daughter to be published by her. Morgan seems to have had a\r\ncertain notoriety as member of a Jacobite club at Westminster, judging\r\nby a very coarse _jeu d’esprit_ bearing the title _A Faithful Narrative\r\nof the wonderful and surprising Appearance of Counsellor Morgan’s ghost\r\nat the meeting ... giving a full and true Account of the Behaviour of\r\nthe Club on that occasion_.... This folio, for it has that dignity, is\r\nfollowed by another entitled _An Appeal from the late David Morgan,\r\nEsq., Barrister-at-Law ... against a late Scurrilous Paper_.... My\r\ncopy of the second pamphlet bears the note in contemporary handwriting\r\n‘By one Fielding a concealer of the Law,’ and it is possible it may be\r\nby Henry Fielding, who at this time gave himself to ironical writing\r\nof this kind in the _True Patriot_ and the _Jacobite’s Journal_. Both\r\npamphlets are full of topical allusions and scarcely concealed names.\r\nMorgan was also the subject of a brutally coarse print entitled ‘An\r\nExact Description of the Solemn Procession of Councellor Morgan’s ghost\r\nto the Rump of the Westminster Independents.’\r\n\r\n[393] The only elucidation of this I can suggest is from a passage in\r\nthe _Appeal_ above mentioned in which Morgan’s ghost is made to visit\r\nhis friends, but ‘with neither a greyhound upon his breast nor a writ\r\nin his hand,’ perhaps suggesting that in life he was in the habit of\r\ncarrying writs and being accompanied by a greyhound.\r\n\r\n[394] The colonel appointed was Francis Towneley, an English Roman\r\nCatholic; b. 1709; fifth son of Charles Towneley of Towneley Hall,\r\nLancashire; went to France 1728, and entered the French army; served\r\nat the siege of Philipsbourg under the Duke of Berwick, but after the\r\npeace following the War of the Polish Succession, returned to England,\r\nand lived privately in Wales until 1745. The French king sent him a\r\ncolonel’s commission about the time of the intended invasion of 1744.\r\n(See _Towneley MSS._, privately printed.) He was given command of the\r\nManchester regiment, as told here; was left governor of the town of\r\nCarlisle when the army retreated to Scotland in December; entirely\r\nopposed to surrendering to Cumberland, flying into a passion with\r\nHamilton, the governor of the castle (see pp. 118, 193), and declaring\r\n‘that it was better to die by the sword than to fall into the hands\r\nof those damned Hanovarians.’ (_Evidence at Trial._) At Hamilton’s\r\ntrial evidence was given that he too desired to hold out to the last,\r\nbut was overruled by his officers. Towneley was tried at Southwark in\r\nJuly 1746; pled that his French commission entitled him to be treated\r\nas a prisoner of war, not a rebel; but this was repelled as, being an\r\nEnglishman born, it was illegal to serve a sovereign at war with the\r\nBritish king; executed on Kennington Common, July 30th, and Hamilton on\r\nNov. 15th.\r\n\r\n[395] The Prince’s Life Guards: there were two troops, one commanded by\r\nLord Elcho, the other by Colonel Elphinstone, afterwards Lord Balmerino.\r\n\r\n[396] The army left Manchester on 1st December. The quarrel which\r\ncaused Lord George Murray’s resignation of his commission as\r\nlieut.-gen. took place at Carlisle on 15th November, when the command\r\nwas given to the Duke of Perth. Daniel cannot be correct in stating\r\nthat Lord George was not reinstated until the army was at Manchester;\r\nthe quarrel was made up before leaving Carlisle on November 20th, when\r\nLord George led the van. Daniel, who did not join the army until the\r\n24th or 25th, is probably writing from hazy recollection of what he had\r\nbeen told.\r\n\r\n[397] Weir or Vere was the principal witness at the trials of the\r\nofficers taken prisoner at Carlisle.\r\n\r\n[398] Jean Louis Ligonnier, generally termed Sir John Ligonier, K.B., a\r\nnaturalised French Protestant; b. at Castres, France, 1680; emigrated\r\nto Dublin; fought under Marlborough through most of his campaigns;\r\nmajor-general 1739; lieut.-general 1743; commanded the infantry at\r\nFontenoy; commanded the army sent to Staffordshire to oppose the\r\nJacobites, until relieved by the Duke of Cumberland, 27th November;\r\ncommander-in-chief 1757; created Viscount Ligonier 1757; Earl Ligonier\r\n1766; field-marshal 1760; d. 1770. He had a brother Francis, who\r\nsucceeded Colonel Gardiner in command of the Dragoon regiment, now 13th\r\nHussars. Francis Ligonier, though suffering from pleurisy, fought at\r\nFalkirk, caught more cold, and died a few days later.\r\n\r\n[399] 6th December 1745 (Black Friday).\r\n\r\n[400] The journals of the day and most authorities estimate the number\r\nat about 800. They consisted of Lord John Drummond’s own French\r\nregiment, ‘the Royal Scots,’ and the Irish picquets, or 50 men picked\r\nfrom each of the six Irish regiments in the French service. Two of the\r\ntransports were taken on the voyage and 260 of all ranks made prisoner.\r\nOn the eve of Culloden, the French envoy reported to his government\r\nthat the numbers of French troops then were: Irish Picquets reduced\r\nto a half but recruited by 148 prisoners and deserters up to 260 men;\r\nRoyal Scots about 350; detachment of Berwick’s regiment (p. 151) 42;\r\nFitzjames’s horse 131; making a total of about 780. (Cottin, _op. cit._\r\np. 36.)\r\n\r\n[401] See _ante_, p. 143.\r\n\r\n[402] ‘Tuesday, 10th December.--They have ordered a contribution of\r\n£5000 for the insolence of the mob, but with much ado they have got it\r\nto one-half, to raise it by one o’clock.’ (_Journal of Elizabeth Byrom,\r\nManchester, in 1745._)\r\n\r\n[403] Hon. Arthur Elphinstone; b. 1688; held captain’s commission in\r\nShannon’s foot (25th, now King’s Own Scottish Borderers), which he\r\nresigned in 1716 to join Mar’s Jacobite army; served in the French\r\narmy; on a pardon being offered to him he declined to accept it until\r\nhe had received the Chevalier’s consent, which was given; joined Prince\r\nCharles at Edinburgh; received the command of the second troop of Life\r\nGuards; on the death of his brother, 5th January 1746, he succeeded as\r\n6th Lord Balmerino and 5th Lord Coupar; the army was then at Stirling.\r\nThe day after Culloden he surrendered to the Grants. Tried by the House\r\nof Lords and condemned to death; beheaded, 18th August 1746.\r\n\r\n[404] Col. James Alex. Grant or Grante, a member of the staff of the\r\nFrench Royal Observatory. He landed at Montrose in October along with\r\nthe French envoy. He served as master of ordnance to Prince Charles.\r\nHe planned the siege of Carlisle, which succeeded. He communicated\r\na plan for the siege of Stirling Castle, which was abandoned, as it\r\nexposed the town to destruction, and the charge was given to another\r\nFrench engineer, Mirabel de Gordon, who utterly failed. Grant planned\r\nthe siege of Fort Augustus, which succeeded. He then planned the siege\r\nof Fort William, but was disabled at the outset by a contusion from a\r\nspent cannon ball: Mirabel was given charge of the siege, and again\r\nsignally failed. Grant prepared an elaborate map of the expedition,\r\npublished in French, English, and Italian editions, which are all\r\ndescribed in the _Itinerary_, pp. 104-107.\r\n\r\n[405] The Yorkshire Hunters, a corps of volunteer cavalry, which did\r\nnot distinguish itself greatly. Its war-song, set to music, will be\r\nfound in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_, December 1745.\r\n\r\n[406] Daniel probably means the Dutch troops, some of which landed at\r\nBerwick and the Tyne in Sept. ’45. The Hessians did not come over until\r\nFeb. ’46.\r\n\r\n[407] See _ante_, p. 150.\r\n\r\n[408] Should be Cluny Macpherson.\r\n\r\n[409] This is the celebrated ‘Skirmish of Clifton,’ fought 18th\r\nDecember; described by Sir Walter Scott in _Waverley_, chap. lix. and\r\nnote. Both sides claimed the victory. The late Chancellor Ferguson\r\nwrote an exhaustive monograph on the subject (Kendal, 1889) showing\r\nthat both were technically right. The Jacobite rear-guard fought to\r\nprotect the army’s retreat to Carlisle, and entirely succeeded in their\r\nobject; Cumberland’s troops retained possession of the field, but\r\nwere too crippled to pursue. Daniel, I think, shows a certain animus\r\nin entirely ignoring Lord George Murray, who directed this action and\r\nfought it with great bravery and skill.\r\n\r\n[410] At the surrender of Carlisle to Cumberland on 30th December the\r\nfollowing officers were captured:--\r\n\r\n_English_, 20 officers and 1 chaplain--of these 9 officers and the\r\nchaplain were executed;\r\n\r\n_Scots_, 17 officers and 1 surgeon--of these 5 officers were executed;\r\n\r\n_French_, 3 officers, who were treated as prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nIn addition 93 English, 256 Scots, 5 French non-commissioned officers\r\nand men were taken prisoner.\r\n\r\n[411] This date is wrong; it should be 20th December, the Prince’s\r\nbirthday and the day he left Carlisle. The date is often given as 31st\r\nDecember, which is the New Style equivalent. Old Style was used in\r\nGreat Britain until 1752.\r\n\r\n[412] The Rev. John Bisset, one of the ministers of St. Nicholas\r\nChurch, Aberdeen, from 1728 to 1756. He was a man of strong personality\r\nwho spoke his mind, and was not very popular with his brethren. Bisset\r\nkept a Diary during the Rising of ’45, most of which is printed in the\r\n_Spalding Club Misc._, vol. i. In that volume there is no reference to\r\nthis sermon, nor do I know when it was preached. It is referred to in\r\ngeneral terms by the late Mr. Watt in his _County History of Aberdeen\r\nand Banff_, p. 303. The sermon was probably printed or Daniel could\r\nnot have quoted it, but Mr. P. J. Anderson, who has kindly searched\r\nthe Aberdeen University Library, cannot find a copy. Bisset, though\r\nuncompromisingly inimical to the Jacobites, declined an official\r\nmeeting with the Duke of Cumberland as a member of the Aberdeen Synod,\r\nbut he obtained a private interview as ‘he had reasons for being\r\nalone.’ Bisset so deeply offended the duke that he refused ever after\r\nto enter a Presbyterian church. (Henderson, _Hist. of the Rebellion_,\r\n5th ed., p. 307.)\r\n\r\n[413] This refers to the Prince’s army. The Prince himself was never in\r\nAberdeen.\r\n\r\n[414] A party of Dumfries townsfolk had cut off a detachment of the\r\nJacobite army’s baggage during the advance to England in November. As\r\na reprisal Prince Charles fined the town £2000. Only £1100 could be\r\nraised in the time given, so he carried off the provost and another\r\ncitizen as security till the balance was paid. (_Scots Mag._, vii. 533,\r\n581.)\r\n\r\n[415] The army began to arrive on Christmas Day. Charles himself\r\nentered on foot at the head of the clans on 26th December. He remained\r\nin Glasgow until 3rd January.\r\n\r\n[416] A very different story is told by Provost Cochrane of Glasgow,\r\nwho wrote: ‘Our very ladys had not the curiosity to go near him, and\r\ndeclined going to a ball held by his chiefs. Very few were at the\r\nwindows when he made his appearance, and such as were declared him not\r\nhandsome. This no doubt fretted.’ (_Cochrane Correspondence_, Maitland\r\nClub, p. 63.) Probably both versions have a certain amount of truth,\r\nand the situation must have been similar to that of an earlier royalist\r\nleader when riding through Edinburgh:--\r\n\r\n    ‘As he rode down the sanctified bends of the Bow,\r\n    Ilk carline was flyting and shaking her pow;\r\n    But the young plants of grace they looked couthie and slee,\r\n    Thinking, luck to thy bonnet, thou Bonny Dundee!’\r\n\r\n\r\n[417] The Prince’s Master of the Household says: ‘The Prince dressed\r\nmore elegantly when in Glasgow than he did in any other place\r\nwhatsomever.’ Lord Elcho says he was ‘dress’d in the French dress.’\r\n\r\n[418] Mirabel de Gordon, a French engineer, who completely failed\r\nat the siege of Stirling, as he afterwards did at the siege of Fort\r\nWilliam. Lord George Murray says of him that he understood his\r\nbusiness, but was so volatile he could not be depended upon: Lord\r\nMacleod states that he was always drunk.\r\n\r\n[419] Brown was a French-Irishman, a captain in Lally’s regiment, who\r\ncame over with the French envoy in October. He was left in Carlisle,\r\nbut escaped at the surrender. After Falkirk he was sent to France to\r\ncarry the news of the victory to Louis XV., who made him a colonel\r\nin the French army. He returned to Scotland in March in the _Hazard_\r\nsloop, which was driven ashore by four men-of-war at Tongue in\r\nSutherland, when the passengers and crew were captured by Lord Reay and\r\nhis militia.\r\n\r\n[420] Probably William Maxwell of Carruchan, Kirkcudbrightshire, who\r\nacted as chief engineer in the defence of Carlisle against the Duke of\r\nCumberland.\r\n\r\n[421] See _ante_, pp. 173, 187. Whatever may have been expected or\r\nmentioned verbally, Cumberland’s written conditions were: ‘All the\r\nterms H.R.H. will or can grant to the rebel garrison at Carlisle are\r\nthat they shall not be put to the sword, but be reserved for the king’s\r\npleasure.’\r\n\r\n[422] Lord George Murray was criticised at the time, even by his\r\nfriends, for being on foot fighting with his men instead of being on\r\nhorseback as a general watching the action and controlling events.\r\n(Elcho, _Affairs of Scotland_, p. 376.) Criticism was also extended to\r\nother generals and staff-officers, particularly to O’Sullivan, who was\r\nnever seen during the action and was accused of cowardice.\r\n\r\n[423] Sir Robert Munro of Foulis, 24th baron and 5th bart.; b. 1684;\r\nsuc. 1729; M.P. for Wick Burghs 1710-41. His mother was an aunt of\r\nDuncan Forbes of Culloden. Entered the army early, and was captain\r\nin the Royal Scots by 1705; served under Marlborough in Flanders,\r\nwhere he made a lifelong friendship with Colonel Gardiner (killed\r\nat Prestonpans); a commissioner of the Forfeited Estates Commission\r\n1716-40; appointed lieut.-colonel and commandant of the new Highland\r\nRegiment (Black Watch) when embodied 1740; fought at Fontenoy; promoted\r\nin June 1745 to be colonel in the 37th (now the Hampshire Regiment),\r\nwhich he commanded at Falkirk.\r\n\r\nDr. Duncan Munro (b. 1687), Sir Robert’s brother, had been a doctor\r\nin India but retired home in 1726. He accompanied his brother from\r\nfraternal affection in the hope of being of use to him, for the colonel\r\nwas very corpulent.\r\n\r\nFor George of Culcairn, a third brother, who fell a victim in ’46, see\r\n_ante_, p. 103.\r\n\r\n[424] I am not aware of any ministers killed, though there may have\r\nbeen some in the Glasgow and Paisley volunteer or militia regiments,\r\nwhich suffered severely. In the Glasgow regiment, commanded by the Earl\r\nof Home, was John Home, afterwards celebrated as author of _Douglas_\r\nand of a _History of the Rebellion_. He was lieutenant, and during\r\nthe battle in command of a company of Edinburgh volunteers. Home\r\nwith several other volunteers was taken prisoner and lodged in Doune\r\nCastle. One of the prisoners was the Rev. John Witherspoon (1723-94),\r\nthen minister of Beith, near Paisley; afterwards in 1768 president of\r\nPrinceton College, New Jersey, a leader in the American Revolution, and\r\na very active member of the first congress of the United States. Home\r\ngives a graphic account of their escape in his history. Later in the\r\nyear Home became minister of Athelstaneford in East Lothian.\r\n\r\n[425] Lockhart was a major in Cholmondeley’s regiment, the 34th (now\r\nthe Border Regiment). He was taken prisoner at Falkirk and released\r\non parole. After Culloden he especially distinguished himself by\r\nextraordinary barbarity and the perpetration of terrible cruelties on\r\nthe hunted fugitives. For instances refer to the _Lyon in Mourning_.\r\n\r\n[426] Every man of common sense who has the least Idea of Military\r\nMatters must well know that, where there is only a small Body of\r\nCavalry attached to an army of light Infantry, as in this case, such\r\nCavalry must be inevitably harrassed because there are not many bodies\r\nof horse to relieve each other. [Note in the Drummond Castle MS.]\r\n\r\n[427] A village between Stirling and Bannockburn; spelt St. Ninians,\r\nbut locally pronounced St. Ringans.\r\n\r\n[428] John Baggot, see _ante_, p. 150.\r\n\r\n[429] See _ante_, p. 101.\r\n\r\n[430] Gordon Castle.\r\n\r\n[431] See _ante_, p. 151.\r\n\r\n[432] This is a vague and incorrect report, probably the camp rumour,\r\nof Lord George Murray’s doings at this time. By a remarkable secret\r\nmarch from Inverness, he simultaneously surprised, on 17th March, a\r\nlarge number of military posts garrisoned by the Government militia in\r\nPerthshire, taking 300 prisoners. He then laid siege to Blair Castle,\r\ndefended by Sir Andrew Agnew, but his guns were too small to hurt the\r\nold castle. He probably would have starved out the garrison, but the\r\nadvance of Cumberland’s army caused his recall to Inverness.\r\n\r\n[433] This being from an enemy is perhaps the most flattering tribute\r\nto President Forbes’s achievement for his Government.\r\n\r\n[434] Cf. _post_, p. 364.\r\n\r\n[435] See _ante_, p. 155.\r\n\r\n[436] See _ante_, p. 157.\r\n\r\n[437] Cumberland left Aberdeen on 8th April.\r\n\r\n[438] Lady Catherine Gordon, daughter of the 2nd Earl of Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n[439] See _post_, p. 230.\r\n\r\n[440] 15th April.\r\n\r\n[441] This is a calumny founded on ignorance of what was passing at\r\na distance from the local situation of the writer--Lord George was\r\nleading the van to the attack of the Enemy’s Camp, which would have\r\nbeen surprised if the rear division had not hung back, and retarded\r\nthe advance of the van ’till it was too late to storm. [Note in the\r\nDrummond Castle MS.]\r\n\r\n[442] The fact was directly the Reverse--Lord George had used every\r\nendeavour to induce the Prince to cross the River, and occupy strong\r\nground which Brigadier Stapleton[656] and Colonel Kerr[657] had\r\nexamined two days before at his Lordships desire. [Note in the Drummond\r\nCastle MS.][658]\r\n\r\n[443] Ruthven in Badenoch, on the east side of the Spey, near Kingussie.\r\n\r\n[444] Daniel is a little out in his recollection of time. Culloden was\r\nfought on 16th April, while he left Scotland on 4th May (see p. 223),\r\nonly eighteen days after the battle.\r\n\r\n[445] This gold was 40,000 louis d’ors. Part of it, ‘Cluny’s Treasure,’\r\nwas concealed in Loch Arkaig, and left there for nine years under the\r\ncare of Cluny Macpherson.\r\n\r\n[446] The British ships were the _Greyhound_, the _Baltimore_, and the\r\n_Terror_. (_S. M._, viii. 238.)\r\n\r\n[447] William Harrison, a native of Strathbogie, who, when most of\r\nhis brethren had been taken prisoner or driven from their charges,\r\nwent to the sheriff of Argyllshire, ‘told him frankly that he was a\r\nCatholic priest, but had neither done nor meant harm to anybody, and\r\nbegged protection. The sheriff was well pleased with his confidence,\r\nand gave him a paper signed by himself requiring of everybody to allow\r\nhim to go about his lawful business unmolested. In consequence of this,\r\nMr. Harrison, in the summers of 1746 and 1747, visited almost all the\r\nCatholics in the Highlands, administering the sacraments, and exhorting\r\nthe people to patience and perseverance in the faith.’ (Bishop Geddes’s\r\nMS.)\r\n\r\n[448] The ships left Lochnanuagh on May 4th. (_L. in M._, iii. 383;\r\n_Scots Mag._, viii. 239.)\r\n\r\n[449] Son of Thomas Sheridan, a fellow of Trinity College, Dublin,\r\nD.C.L. (Oxon.) and F.R.S., an Irish Protestant who followed James II.\r\ninto exile and became his private secretary. His wife (it is said)\r\nwas a natural daughter of the king. The son, Sir Thomas, who was a\r\nCatholic, was engaged in the ’15; appointed tutor to Prince Charles\r\n1724 or ’25, and created a baronet ’26. Attended the Prince at the\r\nsiege of Gaeta ’34. In April ’44 after the abandonment of the French\r\ninvasion the Prince asked for him, and his father reluctantly sent\r\nSheridan to France, warning his son to be careful in his dealings with\r\nhim. Sheridan accompanied the Prince to Scotland and acted as his\r\nprivate secretary throughout the campaign. On arrival in France in ’46\r\nhe was summoned to Rome by the Chevalier; accused of deserting the\r\nPrince but exhibited his written orders to leave. He died at Rome a few\r\nmonths later, his death being variously attributed to mortification at\r\nthe Chevalier’s reproaches, or to grief at the Prince’s disasters.\r\n\r\n[450] He had accompanied the Marquis d’Eguilles to Scotland as\r\ninterpreter.\r\n\r\n[451] John Hay of Restalrig, near Edinburgh, brother of Thomas Hay,\r\nLord Huntington, who married the sister of John Murray of Broughton\r\n(see p. 49). He was an Edinburgh Writer to the Signet, admitted 1726;\r\nSubstitute-Keeper of the Signet 1725-41 and 1742-46; fiscal 1732-34;\r\ntreasurer 1736-46. He acted as treasurer to the Prince, and when\r\nMurray of Broughton fell ill at Inverness in March he succeeded him\r\nas Secretary. Lord George Murray attributed much of the disaster of\r\nCulloden to his neglect or inefficiency in provisioning the army, a\r\nduty which Murray had always performed well. Hay held a colonel’s\r\ncommission in the Jacobite army. He attached himself to Prince Charles\r\nafter leaving Scotland, became major-domo of his household when he went\r\nto Rome after his father’s death in 1766; created a Jacobite baronet in\r\nthat year; dismissed in 1768; returned to Scotland 1771; died 1784.\r\n\r\n[452] Alexander Macleod, an Edinburgh advocate, was aide-de-camp to the\r\nPrince throughout the campaign. His father, John, also an advocate, was\r\na grandson of Sir Norman Macleod of Bernera, and was a first cousin of\r\nLady Clanranald. He had purchased Muiravonside in Stirlingshire, two\r\nmiles from Linlithgow. Alexander was sent from Edinburgh in September\r\nto summon to the Prince’s standard Sir Alexander Macdonald of Sleat\r\nand Macleod of Macleod, both his near kinsmen. This mission, in which\r\nhe failed owing to the stronger influence of Duncan Forbes, brought\r\non him the special anger of the Government. He was attainted, and for\r\nthirty-two years he wandered in the wildest regions of the Western\r\nHighlands and Islands. He received a pardon in 1778, and died in 1784.\r\nHe was in Raasay when Dr. Johnson and Boswell visited that island\r\nin September 1773. He was generally known as Sandie Macleod in the\r\nIslands, and had also acquired the nickname of M‘Cruslick, signifying a\r\ncross between Proteus and Don Quixote. He possessed the most boisterous\r\nspirits, which delighted Johnson and irritated Boswell.\r\n\r\n[453] See _post_, p. 230, _n._ 2.\r\n\r\n[454] Allan Macdowell is a mistake for Macdonell or rather Macdonald,\r\nas his name is afterwards correctly spelled. He was a ‘native of the\r\nIsles’ and a clansman of Clanranald’s; he went out with the clan as\r\nchaplain when the standard was raised, and continued with the army\r\nuntil the end of the campaign. He also acted as confessor to the\r\nPrince. He and Æneas M‘Gillis, the chaplain of Glengarry’s men, were\r\nthe only priests that accompanied the Highlanders to Prestonpans.\r\nThey wore the Highland dress, with sword and pistol, and were styled\r\ncaptains. At the battle of Falkirk Mr. Macdonald rode along the line\r\nand gave his blessing, which the Catholics received kneeling. From\r\nCulloden he accompanied the Prince in his flight and in the earlier\r\npart of his wanderings, leaving him at Scalpa. Later on he was\r\napprehended in South Uist, and sent with some other priests to London\r\nin Ferguson’s ship the _Furness_. He and four other clergymen were\r\nexamined by the Duke of Newcastle, who informed them that they might\r\nleave the country on finding bail for £1000 each not to return. They\r\npointed out that the bail was quite beyond their power, on which the\r\nDuke smilingly replied that they were honest men and he would take each\r\nman’s bail for the other. Macdonald went to Paris, and in 1748 to Rome,\r\nwhere he lived for many years. (Bishop Geddes’s MS.) I do not know if\r\nhe ever returned.\r\n\r\n[455] _Sic_ in _N. M. Mag._ Most likely an error caused by careless\r\ntranscription and meant to read, ‘to Gortlick’s house [not horge] a\r\ngentleman of the name of Thomas Fraser.’ Gortlick, more generally spelt\r\nGortuleg, belonged to Thomas Fraser, a cadet of Lovat’s. It was in\r\nthis house and on this occasion that Prince Charles had his memorable\r\nmeeting with Lord Lovat which is dramatically described by Mrs. Grant\r\nof Laggan. (See _Wariston’s Diary and Other Papers_, p. 265, Scot.\r\nHist. Soc., vol. xxvi.)\r\n\r\n[456] Stratherrick.\r\n\r\n[457] Neil, who at this period is writing from hearsay, is quite wrong\r\nhere. Glengarry was not at home and the house was ‘without meat, drink,\r\nfire or candle, except some firr-sticks!’ Had Ned Bourke not netted a\r\ncouple of salmon, there would have been nothing to eat. (_L. in M._, i.\r\n89, 191.)\r\n\r\n[458] Angus MacEachain (or Macdonald) was a son-in-law of Angus\r\nMacdonald of Borradale. He had served in the campaign as a surgeon in\r\nGlengarry’s regiment.\r\n\r\nThe family of MacEachain-Macdonald of Drimindarach, Arisaig, was a\r\nbranch of the Clanranalds, descended from Eachain (or Hector), a\r\nyounger son of Roderick, 2nd Clanranald. Neil MacEachain was of the\r\nMacEachains of Howbeg, a junior branch of the sept. Both families have\r\nlong since resumed their earlier name, Macdonald, dropping the name\r\nMacEachain.\r\n\r\n[459] This was the Prince’s second visit to Borradale House on\r\nLochnanuagh. It was here he stayed on his first landing in July 1745.\r\nHe came again to Borradale in July 1746, after his wanderings in the\r\nHebrides, by which time the house had been burned down by Cumberland’s\r\nsoldiers; he finally returned to Borradale on 19th September, whence\r\nhe sailed for France the following day. Angus Macdonald, the tacksman\r\nof Borradale, was a son of the 5th laird of Glenaladale, a cadet of\r\nClanranald’s, and was a first cousin of Flora Macdonald. Borradale’s\r\ndescendant, Colonel John Andrew Macdonald, is to-day laird of\r\nGlenaladale.\r\n\r\n[460] Captain Felix O’Neille, born at Rome, son of a brigadier in the\r\nSpanish service. He served in the Spanish army until 1744, when he\r\njoined Lally’s French-Irish regiment as captain. Was sent to Scotland\r\nwith despatches from the Duc de Richelieu in March 1746. After Culloden\r\nhe accompanied Prince Charles during the first two months of his\r\nwanderings and shared his discomforts. He was captured in Benbecula by\r\nCaptain John Ferguson of the _Furness_. He was confined in Edinburgh\r\nCastle until February 1747, when he was released on parole and\r\nsubsequently exchanged (_Scots Mag._, ix. 92). He wrote a journal of\r\nhis wanderings, which is printed in _The Lyon_, i. 102, 365.\r\n\r\n[461] John William O’Sullivan; b. in Co. Kerry, 1700; educated in\r\nFrance and Rome for the priesthood, and, it is said (Fielding’s _True\r\nPatriot_), took orders. Entered the family of Maréchal de Maillebois\r\nas tutor, afterwards secretary. Joined the French army and served\r\nunder Maillebois in Corsica; afterwards in Italy and on the Rhine.\r\nRecommended to D’Argenson as an officer ‘who understood the irregular\r\nart of war better than any other man in Europe, nor was his knowledge\r\nin the regular much inferior to that of the best general living.’\r\nEntered the household of Prince Charles about 1744; accompanied him to\r\nScotland and acted as adjutant-general, as well as private adviser,\r\nduring the campaign. Was with the Prince in his wanderings until 20th\r\nJune. Escaped to France in a French cutter. Knighted by the Chevalier\r\nabout Christmas 1746, and created by him a baronet of Ireland 1753.\r\nDate of death not ascertained.\r\n\r\n[462] Donald Macleod of Gualtergil, on Dunvegan Loch, Skye, the\r\nfaithful ‘Palinurus’ of Prince Charles from 21st April to 20th June. He\r\nwas captured in Benbecula in July, and taken to London in Ferguson’s\r\nship; released June ’47; died at Gualtergil in May ’49, aged 72. His\r\nwife was a sister of Macdonald of Borradale and a first cousin of Flora\r\nMacdonald.\r\n\r\n[463] It seems absurd to write of seizing the boat and stealing away.\r\nIn addition to the Prince’s five attendants, O’Sullivan, O’Neil, Allan\r\nMacdonald, Ned Bourke, and Donald Macleod, there was a crew of seven\r\nboatmen, probably the servants of Borradale who must have known. It is\r\ntrue, however, that the Prince’s intended departure was concealed from\r\nmost of the Jacobite officers assembled in Arisaig.\r\n\r\n[464] Neil is right as to the day of the week, but wrong as to the day\r\nof the month. It should be Sunday, 27th April. See _Itinerary_.\r\n\r\n[465] Rev. John Macaulay, son of the Rev. Aulay Macaulay, minister of\r\nHarris, was ordained parish minister of South Uist in May 1745. He was\r\nsubsequently minister of Lismore and Appin 1755; Inverary 1765, and\r\nfinally of Cardross 1775. He died 1789. At Inveraray he had a good deal\r\nof intercourse with Dr. Johnson in 1773, duly recorded by Boswell in\r\nthe _Tour to the Hebrides_. John Macaulay was the father of Zachary\r\nMacaulay, and grandfather of Lord Macaulay.\r\n\r\n[466] _i.e._ Neil MacEachain.\r\n\r\n[467] Rev. Aulay Macaulay, formerly of Tyree; appointed to Harris 1712;\r\ndied 1758; aged about eighty-five.\r\n\r\n[468] Rev. Colin Mackenzie was not minister of Stornoway but of Lochs,\r\nthe parish to the south of Stornoway.\r\n\r\n[469] Should be 30th April.\r\n\r\n[470] Donald Campbell was the brother-in-law of Hugh Macdonald of\r\nBaleshare and of Donald Roy Macdonald, the former of whom is mentioned\r\nlater on; the latter, though of the family of Sleat, had served in\r\nGlengarry’s regiment. Donald Roy took over charge of the Prince when he\r\nsaid farewell to Flora Macdonald at Portree in Skye. (_L. in M._, ii.\r\n21.) An anecdote of Campbell’s fidelity to the Prince when he protected\r\nhim against a party headed by Aulay Macaulay the minister is given in\r\nthe _Itinerary_. Neil MacEachain does not love Donald Campbell, but Ned\r\nBourke, who was one of the party, calls him ‘one of the best, honestest\r\nfellows that ever drew breath.’ (_L. in M._, i. 191.)\r\n\r\n[471] Lady Kildin should be spelt Kildun. This lady was the wife of\r\nColin Mackenzie of Kildun, a grandson of the 2nd Earl of Seaforth.\r\nMackenzie’s sister was the second wife of Donald, 16th Clanranald,\r\nthe mother of Macdonald of Boisdale, and stepmother of old Clanranald\r\nof the ’45. From private letters belonging to Frances, Lady Muir\r\nMackenzie, I find that Colin Mackenzie was then in London.\r\n\r\n[472] Neil MacEachain is all wrong here in the sequence of events and\r\nin his dates. He was writing from hearsay only. The true sequence will\r\nbe found with authorities for the same in the _Itinerary_, pp. 48-50.\r\n\r\n[473] A quarter of a peck of oatmeal not threshed, but burnt out of the\r\near.\r\n\r\n[474] This was strictly in accordance with Hebridean honesty, continued\r\nto this day. The Prince desired to leave money on the rocks to pay for\r\nthe fish, but O’Sullivan and O’Neille (_not_ the islanders) dissuaded\r\nhim. Cf. _L. in M._, i. 172.\r\n\r\n[475] Prince Charles landed in Benbecula, Clanranald’s island, on 11th\r\nMay, and from this time onward Neil writes from knowledge, not hearsay.\r\n\r\n[476] South Uist.\r\n\r\n[477] Ranald was afterwards taken prisoner and sent to London.\r\n\r\n[478] Corradale is a picturesque valley situated in the mountainous\r\npart of South Uist, which occupies the middle of the east side of the\r\nisland, whose northern, western, and southern confines are wonderfully\r\nflat. Corradale lies about the middle of this district, running\r\nnorth-west from the sea, between the mountains Hekla and Benmore, each\r\nabout 2000 feet high. If approached by sea it was easy for a fugitive\r\nto get away to inaccessible hiding-places in the mountains, while\r\nif attacked from the land he could escape by sea. Prince Charles’s\r\nlodging was a forester’s house not far from the shore. On the north\r\nside of the glen, close to the sea, there is a fairly commodious cave,\r\ntraditionally but erroneously the dwelling-place of the Prince. This\r\ncave was probably the rock under which Neil left the Prince while he\r\nlooked for strangers. Considering the weather to be expected in this\r\nisland, there can be little doubt that the Prince often sat there for\r\nshelter while he looked out for passing ships, as the cave commands an\r\nexcellent view of the offing to the south-east.\r\n\r\n[479] The actual stay at Corradale was from 14th May to 5th June,\r\nalthough the Prince was in South Uist until 24th June. For details, see\r\nthe _Itinerary_.\r\n\r\n[480] See _ante_, p. 213, and Introduction.\r\n\r\n[481] Moidart.\r\n\r\n[482] In _Ordnance Survey_ Glen Quoich, to the west of Loch Garry. I\r\nhave no knowledge of the actions here referred to.\r\n\r\n[483] Donald Macdonald, second son of Clanranald, served as captain\r\nin his brother ‘Young Clanranald’s’ regiment throughout the campaign.\r\nHis mother was Margaret, d. of William Macleod of Luskintyre, son of\r\nSir Norman Macleod of Bernera, and Catherine, d. of Sir James ‘Mor’\r\nMacdonald of Sleat, 2nd bart. Donald’s uncle, Alexander Macleod, was at\r\nthis time laird of Luskintyre in Harris. Donald was afterwards captured\r\nand imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle, but discharged without trial. In\r\n1756 he joined Fraser’s Highlanders (the Master of Lovat’s); fought\r\nwith Wolfe at Quebec and was killed in a subsequent action.\r\n\r\n[484] _i.e._ Boisdale.\r\n\r\n[485] Hugh Macdonald of Baleshare, an island to the south-west of\r\nNorth Uist, was of the Sleat family, his father being a natural son\r\nof Sir James ‘Mor,’ 2nd bart., and his mother a daughter of the 13th\r\nClanranald. As Sir Alexander of Sleat and Lady Clanranald were both\r\ngreat-grandchildren of Sir James ‘Mor,’ they were nearly related to\r\nBaleshare, being in the Scots phrase ‘first-cousins once removed.’\r\nBaleshare’s sister was the wife of Donald Campbell, the Prince’s\r\nhost in Scalpa. Hugh of Baleshare had been sent to South Uist by\r\nLady Margaret Macdonald, the wife of Sir Alexander of Sleat then in\r\nattendance on Cumberland at Fort Augustus, while his men were out\r\nagainst the broken Jacobites. Lady Margaret had sent Baleshare secretly\r\nwith money and little luxuries to relieve the Prince’s discomfort and\r\nto help him generally. At one time it was proposed that Baleshare\r\nshould conceal Prince Charles in his own island, but the scheme was\r\nabandoned as it might compromise his chief, Sir Alexander.\r\n\r\n[486] This power of drinking seems to have made a great impression.\r\nBaleshare told Bishop Forbes that the Prince ‘still had the better\r\nof us, and even of Boystill [Boysdale] himself, notwithstanding his\r\nbeing as able a boulman as any in Scotland.’ It is generally assumed\r\nthat Prince Charles acquired his drinking habits as a result of his\r\nhardships in Scotland, yet his anxious father had detected symptoms of\r\nan over-fondness for wine even before he left Rome in 1744. In a letter\r\nto Colonel O’Bryen (Lord Lismore), his envoy at the French Court, in\r\nAugust 1745, the Old Chevalier writes: ‘La grande vivacité du Prince,\r\nson penchant pour toutes sortes de divertissements, et un peu trop de\r\ngoût qu’il sembloit alors avoir pour le vin, leur ont faire croire\r\nfaussement qu’ils avoient gagné quelque chose sur son esprit et il\r\ndevint bientôt par là leur Héros.’ (Stuart Papers, Browne, _Hist. of\r\nthe High._, iii. 445.)\r\n\r\n[487] See _post_, p. 249, _n._ 3.\r\n\r\n[488] Should be Ulinish. He was a first cousin of Sir Alexander\r\nMacdonald, whose mother was a Macleod of Greshornish. Alexander Macleod\r\nwas made sheriff-substitute in Skye in 1773. In 1791 he was alive and\r\nin his 100th year.\r\n\r\n[489] Captain John Ferguson was the fourth son of George Ferguson,\r\none of six brothers, members of a family long resident at Inverurie.\r\nThe eldest was the celebrated or notorious ‘Ferguson the Plotter’ of\r\nthe late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries; other brothers\r\nfounded the families of Pitfour and Kinmundy. George lived and died\r\nat Old Meldrum near Inverurie, so it may be supposed that his son,\r\nJohn, was born there. Nothing is known of his early career, but in\r\n1746 John Ferguson was in command of H.M.S. _Furness_, (which is\r\nalways spelt _Furnace_ in the Scottish journals and narratives of the\r\ntime), and was employed in hunting fugitive Jacobites. He was the\r\n‘black captain’ of the ’45, one of the most active and ruthless of the\r\nGovernment officers. His cruelties are a constant theme in Jacobite\r\nannals (see the _Lyon_ from the index). Captain O’Neille, who was one\r\nof his prisoners, states that Ferguson used him with the barbarity of a\r\npirate, stripped him, and ordered him to be put into a rack and whipped\r\nby his hangman because he would not confess where he thought the Prince\r\nwas. (_L. in M._, i. 374.) Ferguson was promoted in the same year, by\r\nthe express interference and recommendation of the Duke of Cumberland,\r\nto be captain of the _Nightingale_, a new frigate just launched. He\r\ndied in 1767. (_Records of Clan Ferguson_, p. 280.) Ferguson’s greatest\r\nexploit was the capture of Lord Lovat, which was effected with skill.\r\nLovat had taken refuge in an island on Loch Morar, a fresh-water lake,\r\nand had removed all the boats on the loch to the island. Ferguson\r\nlanded a party, who saw the fugitives, whom they could not reach, and\r\nby whom they were greeted with cries of derision. He then sent a boat\r\nashore from his ship, carried it over a mile or so of rugged country,\r\nand launched it on Loch Morar. Lovat’s party rowed rapidly up the loch,\r\nand got on shore, but after three days’ concealment, the old lord,\r\nunable from infirmities to continue the struggle, determined to give\r\nhimself up, sent word to his pursuers and surrendered to Captain Dugald\r\nCampbell of Achacrossan of the Argyll Militia.\r\n\r\n[490] Fuyia, which I have corrected from Fugia in the _N. M. Maga._, as\r\nit is a manifest error of the copyist or printer. Fuyia gives the local\r\npronunciation of the name of the island, which is generally spelt Ouia\r\nin the _Lyon_, and Wiay in the Ordnance Survey maps. It is spelt Fouay\r\non p. 253.\r\n\r\n[491] Alexander Macdonald of Boisdale (Clanranald’s step-brother) was\r\ncarried prisoner to London, and kept there until July 1747, when he was\r\nreleased.\r\n\r\n[492] This was Boisdale’s third wife, Anne, daughter of Macneil of\r\nBarra.\r\n\r\n[493] Captain Carolina Frederick Scott shares with Ferguson and\r\nLockhart eternal infamy for his superlative cruelty to the hunted\r\nJacobites of the Western Highlands. I found his name and that of\r\nFerguson still perfectly remembered in the Outer Hebrides, and received\r\nwith execrations. He was an officer of Guise’s regiment, the 6th\r\n(now the Royal Warwickshire). His satanic zeal, like Ferguson’s, was\r\nrewarded with promotion. In November 1746 he was appointed major in\r\nhis regiment in the room of Major Wentworth, who was cashiered for\r\nsurrendering Fort Augustus to the Jacobites (March 5th), when three\r\ncompanies of Guise’s regiment were made prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n[494] Meaning Captain O’Neille.\r\n\r\n[495] This is the Beinchillkoinnich of the _Lyon_ (i. 329), the Beinn\r\nRuigh Choinnich of the _Ordnance Survey_; a hill on the north side\r\nof Loch Boisdale, 900 feet high, from whence the low-lying country\r\nof South Uist can be viewed from sea to sea. On the northern spur\r\nthere is a cave accessible only by a precipitous narrow ledge, where\r\nshelter from the weather could be had and an outlook to the Minch.\r\nLocal tradition associates this cave with the Prince. He possibly took\r\nshelter there on this momentous day. South Uist, even in summer, is a\r\nvery rainy island.\r\n\r\n[496] Hugh Macdonald of Armadale, in Skye, was Flora Macdonald’s\r\nstep-father. He was a grandson of Sir James ‘Mor’ Macdonald of\r\nSleat, and was thus a first cousin of Sir Alexander’s father, and of\r\nLady Clanranald’s father, as well as of Baleshare and Mrs. Campbell\r\nof Scalpa. He was a captain in one of Sir Alexander Macdonald’s\r\nindependent companies out against Prince Charles. He had formerly been\r\nan officer in the French army. (Henderson’s _Life of Cumberland_, p.\r\n299.)\r\n\r\n[497] Daughter of Alexander (Montgomerie), 9th Earl of Eglinton.\r\nMarried as his second wife to Sir Alexander Macdonald of Sleat; d. 1799.\r\n\r\n[498] At Alisary, on the slopes of Sheaval, a hill to the south of\r\nLoch Eynort, and rising to the north-east from Flora’s old home of\r\nMilton (or Arrivoulin) on the low ground near the ocean. This was the\r\nhill pasture of her brother’s farm to which the cattle were driven in\r\nsummer, while the owners occupied ‘shielings’ or temporary huts in the\r\nneighbourhood. It was an excellent place to meet. The western side of\r\nthe island is a wide belt of dead level links formed by the sand thrown\r\nup by the swell of the Atlantic, and known as ‘the Machar.’ No wayfarer\r\non the Machar could easily escape detection even if he were miles away,\r\nand it was the night of the full moon. Flora’s shieling was near the\r\nwestern end of the hill region of South Uist, and just about as far\r\nwest as the Prince could have dared to go without losing the shelter of\r\nthe hills.\r\n\r\n[499] Benbecula, that part of the ‘Long Island’ lying between North and\r\nSouth Uist, and joined to these islands by sea-fords passable only at\r\nlow tide and thus easily guarded.\r\n\r\n[500] I found that the custom of nick-naming local notabilities after\r\ndistinguished statesmen still exists. When I was visiting these islands\r\nfifteen years ago I met a crofter known as ‘Gladstone’ on account of\r\nhis financial ability and his persuasive powers of (Gaelic) oratory,\r\nand there were others whose nick-names I have forgotten.\r\n\r\n[501] I obtained a very interesting confirmation of this story from\r\nan aged cailliach when in the islands. She told me that a family of\r\nCampbells, who lived near Loch Eynort or Loch Skipport, had rowed\r\nthe Prince and Neil MacEachain to Benbecula, and that the Prince was\r\nfuriously angry with them; but her explanation of his anger was that\r\nthe boatmen were Campbells, a name not beloved in the Outer Hebrides:\r\nno one had ever thought of the terrifying effect of a tidal island on a\r\nstranger.

He pursued Prince Charles through the\r\nislands, hunting for him as far away as St. Kilda. He was on his way\r\nback from that island when he nearly captured the Prince at Benbecula.\r\nMany of the Jacobite prisoners passed through his hands, and, as a\r\nrule, he was kind to them, contrasting favourably with such men as\r\nScott and Ferguson.\r\n\r\n[506] Spelt Loch Uskavagh in the _Ordnance Survey_.\r\n\r\n[507] _i.e._ Neil MacEachain.\r\n\r\n[508] The home of Sir Alexander of Sleat at this time was Monkstat\r\nHouse (also spelt Mongstat, Mougstot and other variations), in the\r\nparish of Kilmuir, Trotternish. It was built on the site of an ancient\r\nmonastic foundation near the shores of a lake named Columbkill, since\r\nthen drained and parcelled into crofts. The ancient home of the\r\nfamily was Duntulm Castle, about five miles north of Monkstat, but\r\nduring the troubles of the Revolution it is said to have been burnt\r\nby a party landed from a warship. Local legendary lore gives various\r\nother versions of the reason for abandoning Duntulm. By one account\r\nthe family was driven from the castle by the ghost of Donald Gorm, a\r\nsixteenth-century ancestor. By another, it was owing to the death of\r\na child of the family, who was killed by a fall from a window of the\r\ncastle, which is built on the edge of a precipitous rock overhanging\r\nthe sea. Monkstat was built in its stead.\r\n\r\n[509] Alexander Macdonald of Kingsburgh, a senior cadet of the Sleat\r\nfamily, was the 6th in descent from James, a younger son of Donald\r\nGruamach, 6th in descent from John, Lord of the Isles and the Princess\r\nMargaret. Kingsburgh was Sir Alexander’s factor in 1746.

M. and\r\nthe government he never doubted. First intelligence ridiculously\r\nexaggerated, and had delayed military advance, but now Cope will be\r\nsoon in your neighbourhood which ‘with the assistance of H. M. friends\r\nit’s hoped will restore quiet to the country.’\r\n\r\n[514] Near Aberfeldy; Cope reached it when marching to the Highlands\r\nfrom Stirling on 23rd Aug. He reached Trinifuir the 24th; Dalnacardoch\r\n25th; Dalwhinny 26th.\r\n\r\n[515] App. 3. _Mr. Grant to Sir John Cope, dated 25th Aug._--Upon the\r\nfirst Information I had of the Pretender’s son landing in the north\r\nwest Highlands I came to this part of the Country, and conveened all\r\nthe Gentlemen of my name, and gave them Directions to prepare as well\r\nas they could to keep the Peace of the Country. I and my Friends have\r\nhad great vengeance denounced against us by those Clans, who are in\r\narms, for the appearance we made for the Government at the Revolution,\r\nand in the year 1715. We have been preparing to defend ourselves the\r\nbest we could; But now all my Fears are dissipate, as I am informed you\r\nare marching to attack those Rebells, when I think of your abilitys and\r\nexperience, no doubt can remain with me, but that the Highlanders will\r\nrun before you. I wish you from my heart all Success. I have sent the\r\nBearer a cousin of mine who has served several years in the army, to\r\ngive you all the Information he can, and to assure you of my zeal for\r\nthe Support of his Majestys Service and Government, I am with esteem,\r\nSir, etc.\r\n\r\n[516] This date is wrong; Cope reached Ruthven 27th August; Dalrachny’s\r\n(Carrbridge) 28th August; Inverness 29th August. (See _Itinerary_ and\r\nauthorities there quoted.)\r\n\r\n[517] All this is disingenuous and quite anachronic. The Duke of Perth,\r\nit is true, had fled from Drummond Castle on 24th July, and taken\r\nrefuge in Braemar, but he had left long before this, for he was back at\r\nMachany in Perthshire on 9th August. (_Jac. Lairds of Gask_, pp. 103,\r\n104.) Cluny Macpherson at this time had declared openly for government,\r\nhad accepted a commission as captain in Lord Loudoun’s Highland\r\nregiment, and was now actually raising his men for King George. He was\r\nseized by Lochiel on 28th August, carried prisoner to Perth, and not\r\nreleased until the 9th or 10th September, when he undertook to join the\r\nPrince. He returned to Badenoch, and not until then raised his men for\r\nthe Stuart Cause. The Mackintoshes at this time were arming for King\r\nGeorge, under their chief, who was a captain in the Highland regiment\r\n(Black Watch); it was not until considerably later that they deserted\r\ntheir chief to join Prince Charles under Lady Mackintosh.\r\n\r\n[518] Alexander Brodie of Brodie, Morayshire; M.P.

A letter of indignant remonstrance.\r\nCope cannot attack highlanders in their passes or strongholds without\r\nhighlanders to flank the regular troops. If the king’s highland\r\nfriends fail him we are undone, and all of us must be at the mercy\r\nof the rebels. The writer is told that Grant’s people refuse to join\r\nhim (Grant) if he joins Cope or marches out of his own country. Let\r\nhim beware of counsels that will lead to his ruin. Grant should not\r\ngive himself the airs of having a clan that can support and serve the\r\ngovernment if when it comes to the push they tell him they won’t go\r\nalong with him. Grant had written to Cope expressing his readiness\r\nto join and assist him, but he would neither join him nor assist him\r\nwith one man, nor go near him, although Cope stopped at Aviemore and\r\nspent the night at Dalrachny’s (Carrbridge) within ten miles of Grant.\r\nRose of Kilravock, Lord Moray, General Cope and President Forbes are\r\nall disappointed with him. Grant’s uncle, the major (governor of Fort\r\nGeorge, Inverness Castle) is very angry. It would have been far better\r\nif Grant had given no assurances if he were not sure he could fulfil\r\nthem. The writer is distressed about what people are saying of Grant\r\nat Inverness. How glorious it would have been if he had been the first\r\nman in the country to join the king’s forces. The President has got two\r\nhundred stand of arms for the laird of Mackintosh, who is to join Cope\r\nwith two hundred men. Munro, Mackays, Sutherland, Seaforth and others\r\nare raising their men for government. The writer is to meet Cope and\r\nPresident Forbes on Tuesday (3rd September), what is he to say of or\r\nfor Grant at that interview?\r\n\r\nA separate piece of paper contains this rider, ‘I would not have been\r\nso strong if it had not been with a design, that you might show it to\r\nthose of your own people that I am told are not for leaving your own\r\ncountrey; so hope you’ll forgive any strong expressions, as my meaning\r\nis to serve you.’\r\n\r\n[520] Ludovick Grant’s uncle.\r\n\r\n[521] APP. 5. _C. of G._, ii. 152. Duke of Gordon claims a right\r\nto the superiority over Morange, and Glenbucket (the Duke’s former\r\ncommissioner) was threatening the people if they did not join him.\r\n\r\n[522] App. 6. _C. of G._, ii. 155. Grant’s situation had made it\r\nabsolutely impossible to wait on Cope when in his neighbourhood;\r\ntells of Glenbucket’s movements; also that very few have joined the\r\nPretender’s son north of Badenoch; Glenbucket only got 130 men from\r\nStrathdoune (Strathavon) and Glenlivet.\r\n\r\n[523] James Ogilvy, eldest son of the 5th Earl of Findlater and 2nd\r\nEarl of Seafield; b. 1715; suc. as 6th Earl 1764; d. 1770.

And as I have the Greatest Regard for Grant and all his\r\nConcerns, I begg you’ll neither give your Country nor me any Trouble,\r\nI do not chuse to give, and your ready Compliance with this will much\r\noblige him, who is sincerely, Dr. Sir, your most humble servant.\r\n\r\n_P.S._--Let me have your answer p bearer, which will determine me how\r\nto behave.\r\n\r\nAPP. 11. _Mr. Grant to the Gentlemen of Urquhart, dated Castle Grant,\r\n6th Oct._--Auchmony has communicate to me the Subject you have had\r\nlately under your deliberation. All the Return I will give you,\r\nconsidering what I formerly wrote to my Chamberlain, and which he\r\ncommunicate to you is this, That whoever among you dont comply with my\r\ndirections in this present conjuncture, which is to remain peaceable at\r\nhome, and to be ready to receive my Directions as your Superior, and as\r\nMaster of my own Estate, must resolve to obey me at your own Peril. And\r\nas I have firmly determined that whosoever shall insult me or disturb\r\nany part of my Estate shall meet with the Returns such an Insult shall\r\nmerite. I am hopefull none of my neighbours will act a part by me,\r\nwhich I could not nor cannot allow myself to think them capable of. I\r\ncannot conceive the least title any man can have to command any of my\r\nvassals or Tenants, but myself, therefore whoever deserts me to follow\r\nany other at this Time, I must look upon it as a disobedience to me,\r\nwhich I will never forgive or forget to them and theirs. I am perfectly\r\npersuaded all the tenants will adhere and keep firm to me, if they are\r\nnot led astray by bad advice, which I hope they will not follow.--I am,\r\nGentlemen, your Friend and will continue so, if not your own Fault.\r\n\r\nAPP. 12. _The Baillie of Urquhart to Mr. Grant, dated Bellmackaen, 8th\r\nOct._--In obedience to your orders I convened all the Tenents of this\r\nCountry this day, in order to March them to Strathspey, and there was\r\nonly 60 or 70 of the Tenents, that agreed to go with me. Dell and I\r\ncame with all the men that joined us the length of Drumbuie, so far\r\non our way to Strathspey, and Coll MacDonald and all the Gentlemen of\r\nthis Country came up with us there, and one and all of the Gentlemen\r\nbut Sheuglie and his son swore publickly to the Tenents, if they did\r\nnot return immediately or two nights thereafter, that all their Corns\r\nwould be burnt and destroyed, and all their Cattle carried away. And\r\nwhen the Tenents were so much threatned by the Gentlemen as well as by\r\nMr. MacDonald, they would not follow me one foot further. And upon the\r\nTenents returning Mr. MacDonald assured me, that this Country would be\r\nquite safe from any hurt from him and not only so; but as some of the\r\nGentlemen that came north with him, had the same orders as he had to\r\ndestroy this Country, if we did not join them, he sincerely assured me,\r\nhe would do all he could to prevent these Gentlemen from coming. And if\r\nhe could not prevail upon them to keep back, that he would run me an\r\nExpress in a few days to put me on my guard, and acquaint me of their\r\ncoming; but one thing I assure you of e’er ten days that this Country\r\nwill be ruined. Lord Lovat has not appointed a day for his marching as\r\nyet; for I am told that he has the Meal to make that he carrys along\r\nwith him for his Men’s subsistance. There is a Report here this day\r\nthat there is 2000 French landed at Cromarty last Saturday with Prince\r\nCharles Brother. You’ll please let me have your advice how to behave;\r\nfor I am in a very bad situation. Please excuse this confused Letter,\r\nbeing in haste and ever am, Honourable sir, Your most faithfull hubl\r\nsert.\r\n\r\n_P._ Auchmony[660] did not act a right part.\r\n\r\nAPP. 13. _Mr. Grant to the Chamberlain of Urquhart, dated Castle Grant,\r\n10th Oct._--I received yours of the 8th this day about Dinner Time. I\r\nam not at all surprised at the Conduct of the Gentlemen of Urquhart;\r\nfor as they seem determined to disobey my repeated Orders, they want\r\nto prevail with my Tenents to do so likeways. However now that they\r\nmust have heard, that General Legonier with at least 18,000 of our\r\ntroops that have come from Flanders and the Dutch, and that there is\r\n12,000 Danes, and the Remainder of the British Troops dayly expected,\r\nand that nobody even at Edinburgh pretended to say, that the French\r\ncan spare any of their troops, I fancy they will soon see their Folly,\r\nand they must be satisfied in a little Time, I will make them repent\r\ntheir Conduct, and they will see the numbers they believed would join\r\nthe Rebells, dwindle to a very few, if any at all. Whenever you hear\r\nany Motions among your neighbours make the best of your way for this\r\nPlace and see to bring these men with you, who were coming last day and\r\nas many more as you can, and assure them I will see what Losses they\r\nsustain repaid. And shall do all in my power afterwards to save them\r\nwhen others must fly the country. Dont let any of the Gentlemen know\r\nthe day you design to march over with the men, other ways they might\r\nbring a Possy to stop you, which will not be in their Power if you be\r\nupon your Guard. I think you ought to have Spyes in the neighbouring\r\nCountries. See that you get money from the Tenents, who are due, that\r\nwe may clear when you come over.\r\n\r\n[530] APP. 14. _C. of G._, ii. 170. (From Inverness.) Claims Grant as\r\na relation and friend whom he finds, with great satisfaction, acting\r\nso distinguished a part. The king has appointed Loudoun to command the\r\ntroops in this country; it gives him the greatest pleasure to know that\r\nhe has so powerful and faithful a friend to support him in time of need.\r\n\r\n[531] APP. 15. _C. of G._, ii. 171. (From Culloden.) Urging Grant\r\nto press forward his company; any expense after his men are brought\r\ntogether shall be made good. Believes that ‘the thing will blow over\r\nwithout much harm,’ but Grant should have his eye on as many of his\r\npeople as he can arm, to be ready for any emergency; ‘ways and means\r\nshall be fallen on to subsist them.’\r\n\r\n[532] APP. 16. _C. of G._, ii. 175. Mr. Grant’s heart is full of\r\nzeal for the preservation of our religion and liberties, and will\r\nexert himself to do everything in his power for H. M. service, and\r\nis perfectly happy ‘that we who are the friends of government’ have\r\nLoudoun to advise and direct us. The delay in his company’s joining\r\nLoudoun is caused by all his clan vassals being ready, and he wishes\r\nthe company to be all volunteers. He foresees that there will be\r\noccasion to convene all his men and he wants Rothiemurchus with him,\r\nand asks for certain alterations in the commissions to his officers.\r\nAll the men of his company will have swords and most of them pistols\r\nand dirks. Hopes to capture Capt. Gordon, who is levying cess on his\r\nparty as their arms will be useful. He is determined to let none of the\r\nclans now in motion enter his county.\r\n\r\n[533] APP. 17. _John Grant in Urquhart to Mr. Grant, dated 21st\r\nOct._--The MacDonalds and Glenmoristones came into this Country\r\nSaturdays night late, and Sundays morning. And this day we expected\r\nthe Master of Lovat with 200 men to join the MacDonalds, who were in\r\nnumber six score, in order to spreath [ravage] the Country, if the\r\nwhole people did not join them. The countrymen were all acquainted to\r\nmeet this day at Milntown, but few of them attended. And as the Master\r\ndid not come this day, as he appointed, sent word that he would be here\r\ntomorrow morning, so that I am made to understand, that they design to\r\nraise all their Cattle, and by that method are of opinion, that the men\r\nwill come present, and condescend to march directly to the army before\r\ntheir Effects are carried off, but I made the Bearer, who is the only\r\none I could trust in, advise the People to keep at a distance and allow\r\nthem to carry off their cattle, as I assured them that you would repay\r\nthem in what damage they might suffer that way. I cannot acquaint you\r\nat this Time of the Gentlemens Disposition, but tomorrow I shall send\r\nan Express, and give you a full account of our Fate. Belintombs house\r\nwas attacked; but I procured a party from the Colonel to guard it this\r\nnight. Is all on haste but that I remain as becometh, Hon^{ble} Sir\r\nyour most ob. humble servant.\r\n\r\nI am informed they design to march by Inverlaidnan. Barrisdale came\r\nthis day from the north to this country; but did not bring any men\r\nalongst with him.\r\n\r\nAPP. 18. _John Grant in Urquhart to Mr. Grant, dated 22nd Oct._--The\r\nmost of the Countrymen met this day at Bellymore where Barrisdale came\r\nwith a Commission from his Colonel to them, assuring if they did not\r\njoin him, that he was fully resolved to spreath the whole Country. They\r\nall unanimously replyed that in any Event, they would not disobey their\r\nmasters orders and his positive commands to them to sit peaceable at\r\nhome, and swore that while there was a drop of Blood in their Bodys,\r\nthey would not allow the Macdonalds to carry off their Cattle. In a\r\nshort Time thereafter the Master of Lovat accompanied with all the\r\nStratherrick Gentlemen came to Milntown, and after a long Conference\r\nwith Mr. MacDonald of Barrisdale, he agreed that the MacDonalds in\r\nthe Country might be compelled to join the Colonel, as he was not\r\nin readiness to march his men this week, but in the Event that this\r\ndid not satisfy Mr. MacDonald, he was to come in person with 200 men\r\ntomorrow, to prevent their carrying off the Cattle, and secure the\r\nrest of the men for his own use, as he believed he had a better Title\r\nto them than any MacDonald in life. As they could not agree upon the\r\nabove terms, Barrisdale went with the Master to Castle Downie to know\r\nmy Lord’s sentiments, and act accordingly. As this happens to be the\r\ncase we are as yet uncertain of our Fate, but shall to the outmost of\r\nour Power, resist the MacDonalds if not assisted by the Frasers Is all\r\nbut that I remain as becometh, Honourable Sir, Your most obed^t humble\r\nserv^t.\r\n\r\n[534] APP. 19. _C. of G._, ii. 179.

(From Inverness.) Grant’s company\r\nhad arrived the previous day, was a very good one, the best clothed\r\nLoudoun had seen. Was sorry that Lord Lewis Gordon had risen, but the\r\nDuke (of Gordon) had given orders to his people not to join him. Few\r\nhad done so.

Lord Lewis Gordon has only 300 men, and\r\nof these only 100 have joined: mostly herds and hire-men from about\r\nStrathbogie and unacquainted with the use of arms; many of them are\r\npressed and intend to desert; 100 or 150 of Grant’s men would drive\r\nthem to the devil, and capture Lord Lewis and his prime minister\r\nAbbachy (Gordon of Avochie). Lord Findlater’s tenants and the people\r\nof Keith are being ruined by Abbachy and look to Grant as their only\r\nsaviour. If Lord Loudoun would take possession of old Balveny Castle it\r\nwould spoil Lord Lewis’s recruiting.\r\n\r\nAPP. 27. _Lord Findlater’s Steward[542] to his Lordship, dated 11th\r\nDec._--I had a Letter from John Saunders in Keith upon Sabbath day\r\nnight, informing me that there had 60 of Lord Lewis men come to that\r\nplace upon Saturdays night, under command of one White and that he and\r\nothers in that place much wanted advice what to do. To whom I wrote for\r\nAnswer, that I had a letter from Lord Lewis Gordon for your Lordship,\r\nwhich I forwarded by Express, was very peremptor, Lord Lewis had given\r\nno orders for making the least demand upon your Lordships Estate before\r\nits Return, so I expected that none concerned in him, would offer to do\r\nit before that Time, yet notwithstanding thereof, I had the inclosed\r\nthis day from William Taylor, to which I answered that as I sent Lord\r\nLewis Letter to your Lordship per Express, I could neither give answer\r\nnor advice to his Letter, but that I expected that none concerned in\r\nLord Lewis would have made any demand of your Lop. Estate before I had\r\nyour Answer. As likeways that they would have defered compounding the\r\nmatter untill that Time. David Tulloch[662] is just now at Banff with\r\nabout 60 or 80 men and as I am told demands no fewer Levies from that\r\nTown as 200 men. Birkenbush was here last night, and told me that as\r\nit is not in his power to get your Lordships Estate saved in such a\r\nway as he would have desired has utterly refused having any Concern in\r\nuplifting the Levies from that Bounds, for which I have been very angry\r\nat him; but it cannot now help. To appearance Mr. Tulloch or Abbachy\r\nwill be soon here, and unless your Lordship fall upon some shift for\r\nrelief to us, we shall suffer extremely.\r\n\r\n[544] APP. 28. _C. of G._, ii. 192.

All that I shall\r\nsay is, that all their Proceedings will not secure our Safety unless\r\na Sufficient right and Trusty Party is left in Banffshire for Lord\r\nLewis’s small partys will stir as soon as they are past, if there is\r\nnot force enough to suppress them. You know the State of my health\r\nmakes it impossible for me to attend Lord Loudoun and make things\r\nagreeable to him as I would wish. I have writ to Tochineil[663] and\r\nJohn and William Ogilvies Sheriffs deputes to do their duty the best\r\nthey can in all respects; but I am not without my own Fears that Fear\r\nand trembling for after Consequences may make some if not all of them\r\nextremely unwilling to act. Perhaps even they may decline it. You\r\nknow you have full Power in everything that concerns me, to do what\r\nyou think proper and I have full confidence you will do whatever you\r\nthink right; but least some thing more formal should be requisite, with\r\nregard to the office of Sheriff I hereby give you full Power to act\r\nas Sheriff Depute of Banffshire and to employ such substitutes under\r\nyou as you shall think fitt, for which this shall be to you and them a\r\nsufficient warrant and Commission, I always am most affectionately and\r\nentirely yours.\r\n\r\n_P._--My son intends to go down by Forress to wait of Lord Loudoun\r\ntomorrow; but as he continues extremely ill off the Cold I am uncertain\r\nif he will be really able to go. I begg you will send the Inclosed to\r\nTochineil by some sturdy clever Man because the bearer is feckless and\r\ntoo well known, and may be searched for Letters. It contains orders for\r\nTochineil, John and William Ogilvies to attend my Lord Loudoun. Keep\r\nthe Presidents letter. Your wife opened the inclosed from Robert Grant.\r\n\r\n[546] APP. 30. _C. of G._, ii. 189. (From Culloden.)

I shall as\r\nsoon as I get my Men conveened march to Fochabers and endeavour to get\r\nPossession of the Boats, and shall do all in my Power to secure the\r\npassage for the Men under your Command. I am hopefull the Rebells wont\r\nbe able to give much disturbance.\r\n\r\n[552] APP. 33. _Lord Lewis Gordon to Mr. Grant, dated Fyvie, 16th\r\nDec._--I was a little surprised this morning to hear that you had\r\nmarched a body of your Men to the low Country so far as Mulben. Your\r\nReason for such Proceedings I cant find out, as you have not got the\r\nleast disturbance from the Prince, or any of his Friends, since his\r\nRoyal Highness arrival in Scotland. And for my part I have not given\r\nyou the least disturbance, since my coming to the North. So far from\r\nit, that I have given positive orders to the Gentlemen employed by\r\nme to raise the Levies, not to meddle with any of your Estate no not\r\nso much as to raise a man from a little Place called Delnaboe, which\r\nholds of the Duke of Gordon, to the men of which last place, I had a\r\nnatural Title. I now desire to know, if you are to take any Concern\r\nin protecting the Estates of any but your own. If that is the case, I\r\nmust take my Measures accordingly, and as the Consequence must be fatal\r\nyou have none to blame but yourself. I am this minute writing to Lord\r\nJohn Drummond that he may march his Troops directly to this Country to\r\njoin the men I have already raised; but if you withdraw your men, and\r\ngive no further disturbance, it may move me to alter my Resolutions\r\nwith respect to you. I wrote you a Letter from Strathdoune but was\r\nnot favoured with any Return, but must insist on an answer to this in\r\nwriting or by some Gentleman of Character. Offer my Complements to Lady\r\nMargaret and your young Family.--I am with much Respect, etc.\r\n\r\n_Copy Printed Declaration of Lord John Drummond, Commander-in-Chief\r\nof his Most Christian Majesty’s Forces in Scotland._--We, Lord John\r\nDrummond, Commander-in-Chief of his most Christian Majesty’s Forces\r\nin Scotland, do hereby declare, that we are come to this kingdom with\r\nwritten orders to make war against the King of England, Elector of\r\nHannover, and all his adherents, and that the positive orders we have\r\nfrom his most Christian Majesty are to attack all his ennemys in this\r\nKingdom, whom he has declared to be those, who will not immediately\r\njoin or assist as far as will ly in their power, the Prince of\r\nWales, Regent of Scotland his Ally, and whom he is resolved with the\r\nconcurrence of the King of Spain to support in the taking possession of\r\nScotland, England and Ireland, if necessary at the expence of all the\r\nmen and money he is master of, to which three Kingdoms the Family of\r\nStewart have so just and indisputable a title. And his most Christian\r\nMajesty’s positive orders are, that his ennemys should be used in this\r\nKingdom in proportion to the harm they do, or intend to his Royal\r\nHighness’s cause.

DRUMMOND.\r\n\r\n    Addressed to Willm. Moir of Loanmay, Esq., Deputy Governor of\r\n    Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n\r\n[553] APP. 34. _C. of G._, ii. 199. (From Cullen.) Grant’s letter gives\r\nhim vast joy; Culcairn will be with Grant to-morrow, while Macleod will\r\ngo to Banff and thence to Turriff and Old Meldrum.\r\n\r\n_Culcairn to Mr. Grant, dated 17th Dec._--I came here this day with\r\nCaptain William Macintoshes Company and mine, and have written to the\r\nLaird of M‘Leod telling my coming here and Resolution of going tomorrow\r\nto Cullen etc. and therefore pray acquaint me how affaires are with\r\nyou. I wrote also to the Laird of M‘Leod to acquaint me how affaires\r\nare with him.--I am, D^r Sir, yours etc.\r\n\r\nThe following note was inclosed--\r\n\r\nAll the Information that is known here about the Rebells, who fled\r\nOut of Fochabers, is that they all marched to Huntly, and about 6 men\r\nas computed abode in Newmilns Sunday night and on Monday followed to\r\nHuntly. There is no word yet from Lord Loudon.\r\n\r\n[554] APP. 35. _Declaration published at Strathbogie by Mr. Grant,\r\ndated 18th Dec._--Whereas many of his Majesty Subjects have been\r\ncompelled by Force and Threats to enlist in the Service of the\r\nPretender, whilst there was no Force sufficient to protect them.\r\nIf any such shall resort to me, and deliver up their arms, I shall\r\nsignify their dutiful Behaviour in this point, to the end that it may\r\nbe a motive to obtain their pardon from his Majestys Grace and will\r\nendeavour to free all of illegal and treasonable Levies of men and\r\nmoney; but such as presumes to persist in their treasonable Practices\r\nand to resist will be treated as Traitors.\r\n\r\n[555] APP. 36. _C. of G._, ii. 194. (From Inverness.) Loudoun’s letter\r\nafter applauding Grant’s zeal is very much the same as Lord Deskford’s\r\nletter which follows.\r\n\r\n[556] APP. 37. _Lord Deskfoord to Mr. Grant, dated 14th Dec._--I am\r\nnow with Lord Loudon and in a conversation with him, I find that he\r\nis Sorry he has not Sufficient authority as yet from the Government\r\neither to give Pay to any Clan, except when an immediate necessity\r\nwhich cannot be answered by the Troops upon the establishment requires\r\nit, nor has he any arms to dispose of to the Friends of the Government,\r\nscarcely having sufficient arms here for the independent companies and\r\nhis own Regiment. This being the Case and the Service in the Countrys\r\nof Banff and Aberdeenshire being sufficiently provided for by the 700\r\nmen already sent to that Country, it is impossible for him to take your\r\nmen into Pay, and as your arms are certainly not extremely good, and\r\nhe cannot give you others, I believe he would be as well pleased, that\r\nyour People should go back to Strathspey; but he does not care to take\r\nit upon him to order them back, as the thing was undertaken without\r\nhis Commands. If you carry your People home, he wishes you gave M‘Leod\r\nInformation of it because he must regulate his motions accordingly\r\nwith the independent Companys. He says he wont fail to represent your\r\nZeal and that of your People, and wishes for the future nothing may\r\nbe undertaken but in concert with those who have the Direction of the\r\nKings affaires in this Country. Pray let us hear what you do. Loudon\r\nwho is much your Friend assures me of another Thing which is that the\r\nfirst opportunity that offers of employing any People in a way to make\r\nthem make a figure he will most certainly throw it into your hands. I\r\nhear there are more Troops to march eastward tomorrow. When Lord Loudon\r\nsets out himself is not certain.--I am, Dear Sir, etc.\r\n\r\nAs the Governor commands here in Lord Loudons absence My Lord says he\r\nwill chuse to leave the Grants here with him, that he may have one\r\nCompany that he may entirely depend upon.\r\n\r\n[557] APP. 38. _C. of G._, ii. 201. (From Huntly.) Grant writes he has\r\na letter from Loudoun intimating he should not have marched further\r\nthan Keith, and he will return there next day. Culcairn and Mackintosh\r\nwant to join Macleod at Inverurie to-morrow night.\r\n\r\nAn enclosure contains the following lines, which naturally were not\r\nsent up to Government, and are not in the Record Office. They are taken\r\nfrom _The Chiefs of Grant_:--\r\n\r\n    ‘Lord Loudoun will not act as Cope,\r\n    Whose ribbon now is call’d a rope;\r\n    If Grant is armed to join M‘Leod\r\n    The enemy is soon subdued.’\r\n\r\n\r\n[558] APP. 39. _C. of G._, ii. 200. (From Banff.) Macleod very sorry\r\nthat Grant is not to join him at Inverurie, but he knows best what\r\nLoudoun has directed.\r\n\r\n[559] APP. 40. _C. of G._, ii. 202. (From Castle Grant.)\r\n\r\n[560] APP. 41. _C. of G._, ii. 205. (From Elgin.)\r\n\r\n[561] For a detailed account of the action at Inverurie on 23rd\r\nDecember, see _ante_, p. 140 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[562] APP. 42. _Mr. Grant to the Magistrates of Elgin, dated 29th\r\nDec., in answer to their Letter following._--I received your Letter of\r\nyesterdays date signed by you and the Magistrates of Elgin, informing\r\nme that Macleod and his men were then marching from your Town towards\r\nInverness and that you are now exposed to the same oppression with the\r\nother Burghs to the East. As you had Intelligence that there are 500\r\nmen ready at Strathbogie to come over, who have sworn heavy vengeance\r\nagainst you. How far it may be in my Power to give them a check, and to\r\nprevent the oppression they threaten you with, I dare not positively\r\nsay; but I assure you, I have all the Inclinations in the world to\r\nbe of as much Service to my Friends and neighbours during these\r\ntroublesome Times as I possibly can. Upon the 10th of this month I was\r\ninformed that the Party under Abbachys Command was levying the Cess and\r\nraising men in a most oppressive manner in Banffshire, and that they\r\nwere to detach a large Party to your Town, and were threatning to use\r\nthe same acts of violence against you. As at that Time I knew nothing\r\nof the Relief that was acoming to you from Inverness. I conveened upon\r\nthe 12th the most of the Gentlemen of the Country and about 500 of the\r\nmen, and marched directly to Mulben with an Intention to cover your\r\nTown and Country, and to assist my Friends and neighbours in the County\r\nof Banff. All this I did without any advice or Concert with those\r\nentrusted at Inverness, only the very day I marched from this, I wrote\r\nand acquainted them of my Intention; but as they imagined they had\r\nsent Force sufficient to clear all betwixt them and Aberdeen, I found\r\nit was not expected that I should proceed further than Keith or my own\r\nEstate of Mulben; however as I was resolved to chase the Rebells out of\r\nBanffshire, if in my Power I proceeded to Strathbogg where I remained\r\ntwo nights, and then finding that I was not desired or encouraged to go\r\nfurther, I returned home, leaving a party of 60 men, with officers in\r\nMulben to prevent any small partys of the Rebells either from visiting\r\nyou or oppressing that neighbourhood. My Party continued there till all\r\nthe M‘Leods had passed in their way to Elgin; but then the officers\r\nthere thought it was not proper for so small a body to remain longer,\r\nwhen Such numbers of the Rebells were so near them. My present opinion\r\nis that you may all be easy, unless you hear that a much greater body\r\ncome from Aberdeen to join that at Strathbogie for these at Strathbogie\r\nwill never venture to cross Spey, when I am above them and Lord Loudon\r\nis so near them. Altho the MacLeods have marched to Inverness, I am\r\npersuaded Lord Loudon will send another body sufficient to give a\r\ncheck to those at Strathbogie. In the situation I am at present in I\r\nam uncertain whether I am to be attacked from Perth or by those at\r\nAberdeen and Strathbogie for my late March. I dare not promise to march\r\nwith any body of Men but in Concert and with Lord Loudons Directions.\r\nAnd at the same Time I have demanded to be assisted with arms, and\r\nencouraged to keep my Men in the proper way. There is no body can\r\nwish the Peace and happiness of my Friends in the Town of Elgin than\r\nI do. And I shall always be ready to use my best Endeavours towards\r\npreserving the Tranquility you at present enjoy.--I am, etc.\r\n\r\n_The Magistrates of Elgins Letter to Mr. Grant, dated December 28th,\r\n1745._--The Laird of M‘Leod and his Men are this moment marching from\r\nthis Place towards Inverness, so that we are left exposed to the like\r\nRavage and oppression which other Burghs and Counties to the East\r\nof us labour under. And unless we be immediately favoured with your\r\nProtection, we and many others of the principal Inhabitants must remove\r\nwith our best effects to some Place of Safety without loss of Time.\r\nBy Intelligence we have from the other side of Spey there are 500 at\r\nStrathbogie ready to come over and who have threatned a heavy vengeance\r\nupon us, so that we have all the Reason in the World to guard against\r\nthe Blow in some shape or other. We therefore begg you may give us a\r\npositive and Speedy Answer. And we are respectfully, Hon^{ble} Sir,\r\nYour most humble Servants.\r\n\r\n[563] APP. 43. _Sir Harry Innes to Mr. Grant, dated 28th Dec._--The\r\ndesertion among all the Companys has been so great that M‘Leod is\r\nresolved to march to Forress, and for ought I know to Inverness. This\r\nwill lay this Town and Country open to the Insults of the Rebells.\r\nTherefore the Magistrates have writ you and have desired me to do the\r\nsame, desiring you may march Such a body of your Men here as will\r\nsecure the Peace of the Country and Town; but as you are best Judge of\r\nthis.--I am, D^r Sir, etc.\r\n\r\n_P.S._--We had yesterday the accounts of the Highland Armys being\r\ntotally routed and dispersed betwixt Manchester and Preston betwixt\r\nthe 13th and 14th. The Prince as he is called flying in great haste\r\nwith about 100 horse. The Duke of Perth amongst the Prisoners. If\r\nM‘Leod marches I must with him or go to you, but I think I shall go to\r\nInverness for I am not liked at present by many.\r\n\r\n_Sir Harry Innes to Mr. Grant, dated 28th Dec., probably from Innes\r\nHouse._--I wrote you this forenoon from Elgin, which I suppose would\r\nor will be delivered to you by one of the Council of Elgin. As M‘Leod\r\nwas then resolved upon Marching here, they were determined to apply to\r\nyou for some Relief and Support for their Town and Country in General.\r\nI have and must do M‘Leod Justice. He is far from loading you with\r\nany share of their late unlucky disaster, and would willingly act in\r\nConcert with you for the Common well, but to his great Surprise when he\r\ncame here, he found that his men who had deserted in place of going to\r\nInverness had mostly past from Findorn to the Ross side. So he does not\r\nknow when or where they may meet. This has hindered him from writing to\r\nyou to desire you to bring your men to Elgin in order to act with his.\r\nAltho he had desired this from no other authority, or any Reasons, but\r\nyour doing the best for the common Cause, but this unlucky passing of\r\nhis men at Findorn has prevented his writing as he told the Provost of\r\nElgin he was to do. For these Reasons I run you this Express that you\r\nmay think how to act. I go to Lord Loudon and the President tomorrow,\r\nand will return to M‘Leod Monday forenoon.--My Complements, etc.\r\n\r\n_P._--The President writ me that Lord Deskfoord is gone for London in\r\nthe _Hound_ and that they sailed the 25th.\r\n\r\n[564] APP. 44. _C. of G._, ii. 208. (From Inverness.)\r\n\r\n[565] APP. 45. _Mr. Grant to Lord Loudon, dated the 9th Jany\r\n1745-6._--Inclosed your Lordship has a letter I received this day from\r\nJohn Grant Chamberlain of Urquhart. The subject contained in it gives\r\nme the greatest uneasiness. I thought I had taken such measures as to\r\nprevent any of the Gentlemen or Tenants of that country from so much\r\nas thinking to favour the Rebells far less to join them. I have sent\r\nthe Bearer James Grant my Chamberlain of Strathspey, who has several\r\nRelations in that Country to concur with John Grant my Chamberlain of\r\nUrquhart in every Measure that can prevent these unhappy People from\r\npursuing their Intentions of joining the Rebells. And I have ordered\r\nhim to obey any further Orders or Instructions your Lordship shall give\r\nhim for that purpose, and I am hopefull I’ll get the better of that mad\r\nvillain Currymony who is misleading that poor unhappy People.\r\n\r\nThat I may not weary your Lordship, I’ll leave to him to tell you all\r\nthat he knows relating to that country. I have just now received the\r\nInclosed from Lord Strechin by Mr. Sime Minister of Longmay: My Lord\r\nStrichen did all in his Power to save my Friend Lieutenant Grant from\r\nbeing taken Prisoner, even to the hazard of his own Life. I would\r\ngladly march to relieve him as my Lord Strichen suggests in his Letter,\r\nbut I take it for granted that that Thing is impossible, for I could\r\nnot march to that Country with any Body of men but the Rebells must\r\nhave notice of it, and would send my Friend to Aberdeen and so forward\r\nto Glames, where the rest of the Prisoners are. I am hopeful the\r\nKinghorn Boat on board of which my Friend came to Fraserburgh is by\r\nthis time arrived at Inverness, but least it should not, I send your\r\nLordship with the Bearer the two last Newspapers from Edin^r, which\r\ncame by Lieutenant Grant who luckily delivered them with my Letters to\r\nLord Strichen, before he was made Prisoner. And I must refer it to the\r\nBearer to inform your Lorp. of the manner of Mr. Grant’s landing and\r\nbeing taken Prisoner. Mr. Syme who brought me Lord Strichens letter\r\ninforms that Mr. Grant told that part of the Duke of Cumberland’s\r\nhorse arrived at Edinburgh Wednesday last. That the Duke of Cumberland\r\narrived at Edinburgh on Thursday last with a great body of horse, and\r\nthe foot were following. I think it my duty to take notice to your Lop.\r\nthat the Rebells are exerting themselves in every corner of the North\r\nto increase their army. I therefore think it absolutely necessary that\r\nall the Friends of the Government should use their outmost efforts to\r\ndisconcert and disperse them. I had a meeting yesterday with all the\r\nGentlemen of this Country, and I can assure your Lop. we wait only\r\nyour orders and Directions, and there is nothing in our Power, but\r\nwe will do upon this important occasion for the Service of our King\r\nand Country. I wish it was possible to assist us with some arms, and\r\nmoney to be sure also would be necessary; but give me Leave to assure\r\nyour Lordship that the last farthing I or any of my Friends have, or\r\nwhat our Credite can procure us, shall be employed in supporting of\r\nour men upon any Expedition your Lordship shall direct us to undertake\r\nfor this glorious Cause we are engaged in. I wish to God your Lordship\r\nand the Lord President would think of some measure of conveening the\r\nwhole body of the Kings Friends in the north together, and I would\r\ngladly hope we would form such a body, as would in a great measure\r\ndisconcert and strike a damp upon the army of the Rebells in the South,\r\nand effectually put a stop to any further Junctions they may expect\r\nbenorth Stirling and at the same Time surely we might prevent their\r\nbeing masters of so much of the North Coast, and also hinder many of\r\nthe Kings Subjects from being oppressed by the exorbitant sums of money\r\nthe Rebells are presently levying from them. Complements etc.\r\n\r\n[566] APP. 46. _Lord Loudon to Mr. Grant, dated 16 Jany. 1745-6._--I\r\nhave had the Honour of two Letters from you since I had an opportunity\r\nof writing to you. I think your scheme of relieving the low Country is\r\na very good one; but in the present situation until I have a Return of\r\nthe Letters I have sent for Instructions, and a little more certainty\r\nof the motions of the Rebells, I dare not give them any opportunity\r\nof Slipping by the short road over the hills into this Country and of\r\ncourse into possession of the Fort. Whilst I am in the low Country,\r\nas soon as Instructions arrive, I shall be sure to acquaint you, and\r\nconsult with you the most effectual way of doing real Service to our\r\nMaster and our Country. I begg my Complements etc.\r\n\r\n[567] The Prince arrived at Blair Castle 6th February, and left on the\r\n9th.\r\n\r\n[568] APP. 47. _C. of G._, ii. 222. (From Inverness.) Giving news of\r\nthe abandonment of the siege of Stirling Castle by the Jacobites and\r\ntheir retreat to the north. The desertion among them has been very\r\ngreat, and it will take time to re-collect their people before they can\r\nhurt us.\r\n\r\n[569] APP. 48. _Intelligence sent to Lord Loudon by Mr. Grant, 9th\r\nFebruary 1746._--Last Thursday Mr. Grant sent by a Ministers son\r\nnot having had time to write, being busied in his own Preparations,\r\nIntelligence of the Rebells motions, and what was said by some of their\r\nleaders to be their Intention.\r\n\r\nSaturday morning he wrote M‘Leod the substance of it with the orders\r\nthen brought to Badenoch, which as M‘Leod would forward was unnecessary\r\nfor Mr. Grant to do. Since the above many confirmations of it have\r\narrived but nothing new all this day.\r\n\r\nThe inclosed is a copy of their Resolutions taken at their Meeting in\r\nBadenoch, where Cluny was present and approved of them.\r\n\r\nMany of the M‘phersons came home before Cluny and many of them\r\nexpressed Resolutions not to be further concerned; but how far they\r\nwill be steady is uncertain.\r\n\r\nIt is said by pretty good authority, that the Glengerry men after the\r\nInterment of Angus MacDonald openly and in a body left the army, and\r\nmany of the Camerons followed their example. It is certain most of\r\nKeppoch’s men were at home some time ago, but people are sent to use\r\ntheir outmost Endeavours to bring all the above back, and influence\r\nwhat more they can, for which purpose it is said they will remain at\r\nleast two days at Badenoch.\r\n\r\nTheir Prince was said to be at Cluny last night, but the men remaining\r\nwith him, and coming through the hills to be only in the Country this\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nA deserter from those coming by the Coast, and who only left them in\r\nAngus, says Duke Cumberland was entering Stirling, as last of their\r\narmy was going out, Confirms the great desertion since the battle, and\r\nasserts it continues dayly, also that there is no division coming by\r\nBraemar.\r\n\r\nThe above Deserters and others and Letters say that Clanhatton,\r\nFarquharsons, French, Pitsligo, Angus, Mearns and Aberdeenshire\r\nPeople came by the Coast for whom Billets were ordered last Wednesday\r\nat Aberdeen, and that some M‘Donalds, M‘Kenzies, Frasers, M‘Leods,\r\nCamerons, Stewarts, M‘Phersons, Athole and Drummond men are coming by\r\nthe Hills.\r\n\r\nSome Clatters say they wont disturb Strathspey, and others that it is\r\ntheir formed Plan to march through and disarm it, and join the rest in\r\nMurray. The Truth is not yet known. There are some Rumours from the\r\nSouth that part of the Duke’s Army are following briskly by the Coast,\r\nand that upon the Rebells leaving Stirling, two Regiments were ordered\r\nto embark for Inverness. Mr. Grant and all his Friends have been alert\r\nas desired. Many spyes are employed and what is material shall be\r\ncommunicated.\r\n\r\nThe Bearer will explain Mr. Grants numbers and present distribution of\r\nthem, with the various Instructions given for the different occurences\r\nthat may happen. In the general it may be depended upon, that Mr. Grant\r\nwill act zealously with his whole Power in every shape that shall be\r\njudged best, suitable to the hearty Professions he hath all along\r\nmade, and upon a closer scrutiny finds he could bring furth 5 or 600\r\nmore good and trusty men if he had arms, than he can in the present\r\ncondition. If there are arms to be given the Bearer will concert their\r\nConveyance.\r\n\r\nSunday 8 at night. This moment fresh Intelligence arrived from\r\nRothemurkus as follows. It confirms most of what is above.\r\n\r\nThey are ignorant in Badenoch of the present root of the army, and\r\nconceal their Losses as much as possible, but acknowledge they lost\r\nconsiderably before Stirling, and obliged to leave behind them seven\r\nheavy cannon of their own, and part of their Ammunition and Baggage,\r\nwith all the Cannon and Ammunition taken from the King’s army.\r\n\r\nThat they have brought north all their Prisoners. The Duke was advanced\r\nas far as Perth. Their Prince is to be at Ruthven tomorrow where his\r\nFieldpieces and five, and some say 9 battering Cannon is arrived. Tho\r\nthey conceal their designs with great secrecy the Prisoner officers\r\nconjecture their design is against Inverness. All the men of Strathern\r\nare gone home and to meet the Army in its way to Inverness, which is to\r\ngo through Strathspey, and the Division coming by the Coast to march\r\nthrough Murray. They call these in Badenoch seven Regiments, made up of\r\nthe people above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThat many the writer conversed with declared they were sick of the\r\npresent Business, and wish for a sufficient Force to protect them at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nOne man says he heard their Prince declare he would quarter next\r\nTuesday in the house of Rothemurkus.\r\n\r\nSome means are employed to endeavour to increase the desertion and to\r\ncreate some dissention. If they prove effectual the Conclusion will be\r\nquicker and easier.\r\n\r\n[570] APP. 49. _C. of G._, ii. 225. (From Castle Grant.) A long letter\r\nof various items of intelligence.\r\n\r\n[571] APP. 50. C. OF G., ii. 224. (From Inverness.) Though a supply of\r\narms has come it is impossible to send them and men must come for them.\r\nHe will be glad to consult and co-operate with Grant. He has brought\r\nback troops from Forres and needs money: will Grant send him the cess\r\nhe has collected.\r\n\r\nAPP. 51. _C. of G._, ii. 223. (From Culloden.) The Aberdeen rebels\r\nmuch discouraged, for the most part separated, and will not easily\r\nbe brought together again. The Jacobites’ intention is to capture\r\nInverness and force all the neighbourhood into their service.\r\nGlengarry’s and Keppoch’s people and the Camerons are almost all gone\r\nhome, but leaders are sent to fetch them out. All this will give time\r\nto the friends of government.\r\n\r\n[572] APP. 52. _C. of G._, ii. 232. (From Castle Grant.) A long letter\r\nof details of intelligence of the movements of the Jacobite army.\r\n\r\n[573] APP. 53. _Further Intelligence, dated 15th Feb. 1746, Saturday 7\r\no’clock at night._--Two persons confirm that Letters from Lord Loudon,\r\netc., were stopt at Ruthven. One of them says the Bearer was hanged\r\nthis morning. Both agree the Bridges on the road to Athole are broke\r\ndoun, That the Castle of Ruthven was burnt last night, and stables\r\nthis morning. The Prince to be at Inverlaidnan this night, some of\r\nhis People in Strathern,[665] the last at Avemore. The Macphersons to\r\nmarch to-morrow all for Inverness. Best Judges call them about 5000.\r\nThe Campbells were at Blair. The Duke certainly at Perth the 12th. The\r\nHessians certainly landed at Leith. Several Expresses for this are\r\nstopt. You know better than we do what is doing in Murray.\r\n\r\n[574] Near Carrbridge.\r\n\r\n[575] APP. 54. _Lord Loudon to Mr. Grant, dated Inverness, 15th\r\nFeb._--I have been honoured with a Letter from you last night, and\r\nanother this morning, and I have seen yours to the Governor, all with\r\nthe Intelligence which you have got for which I am very much obliged\r\nto you, and as we have had notice some time I hope if they do come,\r\nwe shall be able to give them such a Reception as they will not like.\r\nI expect to be reinforced with 900 or 1000 men in two days, and every\r\nday to grow stronger. I have thought seriously on every method of\r\nsending you arms; but do not see as we are threatned with an attack,\r\nthat I can answer sending such a detachment from hence. A march that\r\nmust take up 4 days, as well bring the arms safe to you. Consider the\r\nClan hattonn[666] are all come home. The Frasers and the Gentlemen of\r\nBadenoch are appointed to intercept them, and if we have any Business\r\nit must be over before they return. As to the number you mention, you\r\nknow how small the number is, I have to give, and how many demands are\r\nmade on me, and by people who are none of them near so well provided\r\nas you are. If you can send down 300 men, I shall endeavour to provide\r\nthem as well as I can that is the outmost I can do. You are very good\r\nas you be advanced to send us constantly what accounts you get, but by\r\nall I can learn your accounts magnify their numbers greatly. I beg you\r\nwill make my Compliment to all ffriends.--I am with real Esteem and\r\nSincerity, Dr. Sir, yours etc.\r\n\r\n[576] This date not quite right. The ‘Rout of Moy’ took place on the\r\n17th. Loudoun evacuated Inverness on the 18th, and the Jacobite army\r\nreached the town the same day. The castle (Fort George), garrisoned\r\npartly by Grant’s company and commanded by his uncle, surrendered to\r\nthe Prince on February 20th. (_Scots Mag._, viii. p. 92.)\r\n\r\n[577] Sir Everard Fawkener, secretary to the Duke of Cumberland;\r\nb. 1684; originally a London mercer and silk merchant; the friend\r\nand host of Voltaire in England 1726-29; abandoned commerce for\r\ndiplomacy; knighted and sent as ambassador to Constantinople 1735;\r\nbecame secretary to the Duke of Cumberland, and served with him in the\r\nFlanders campaign; for his services was made joint postmaster-general\r\n1745; accompanied the Duke throughout his campaign in Scotland 1746; d.\r\n1758.\r\n\r\n[578] The Duke of Cumberland arrived at Aberdeen on February 27th or\r\n28th.\r\n\r\n[579] Not the modern Castle Forbes on the Don, in Keig parish, but the\r\nold Castle Forbes at Druminnor, in the parish of Auchindoir and Kearn.\r\n\r\n[580] Cumberland crossed the Spey on April 12th.\r\n\r\n[581] Fort Augustus surrendered to the Jacobites, March 5th.\r\n\r\n[582] Alexander, the father, had died, a prisoner, before 29th July.\r\nHe died a natural death, but in Glenurquhart it was believed that he\r\nwas burned to death in a barrel of tar. (Wm. Mackay, _Urquhart and\r\nGlenmoriston_, p. 288.)\r\n\r\n[583] Not dated, but must have been written before 29th July, _i.e._\r\nprior to Sheugly’s death.\r\n\r\n[584] Sir Dudley Ryder (1691-1756) was Attorney-General 1737-54;\r\nprosecuted the Jacobite prisoners of 1746; appointed Lord\r\nChief-Justice, 1754; cr. Baron Ryder of Harrowby 1756, and died the\r\nsame year.\r\n\r\n[585] Hon. William Murray (1705-92), fourth son of David, 5th Viscount\r\nStormont. He was Solicitor-General 1742-54, and the active prosecutor\r\nof Lord Lovat; Attorney-General 1754-56; Lord Chief-Justice 1756-88;\r\ncreated Baron Mansfield 1756, and Earl of Mansfield 1776. His father\r\nand eldest brother were denounced as rebels, fined and imprisoned for\r\ntheir conduct in 1715. His brother James (_c._ 1690-1770) attached\r\nhimself to the court of the Chevalier de St. George; in 1718 he was\r\nplenipotentiary for negotiating the marriage of James. In 1721 he was\r\ncreated (Jacobite) Earl of Dunbar, and he was Secretary of State at the\r\ncourt in Rome, 1727 to 1747; he was dismissed in the latter year at the\r\ndesire of Prince Charles, who deemed him responsible for the Duke of\r\nYork’s entering the Church; he retired to Avignon, where he died _s.p._\r\nin 1770.\r\n\r\nMurray’s sisters entertained Prince Charles in the house of their\r\nbrother, Lord Stormont, at Perth from the 4th to the 10th April 1745.\r\n\r\n[586] Solicitor to the Treasury.\r\n\r\n[587] This report is printed, _post_, p. 400.\r\n\r\n[588] Alexander Grossett, a captain in Price’s Regiment (14th, now\r\nP. of W. O. West Yorkshire). An engraving, dated 14th Jan. 1747,\r\nentitled ‘Rebel Gratitude,’ depicts the death of Lord Robert Ker and\r\nCaptain Grossett at Culloden. About the latter the following legend is\r\nengraved on the print: ‘Captain Grosett, Engineer and Aid de Camp to\r\nthe General.’ The rebel ‘shot Captain Grosett dead with his own pistol\r\nwhich happened accidentally to fall from him as he was on Horseback,\r\nunder pretence of restoring the same to the Captain.’ Grossett had been\r\naide-de-camp to General Handasyde; he was serving on General Bland’s\r\nstaff at Culloden, according to family tradition.\r\n\r\n[589] Sir John Shaw of Greenock, 3rd bart.; he was a cousin of\r\nGrossett’s. I have failed to find his name in any record of officers\r\nconnected with the customs or excise at this time. His father, whom he\r\nsucceeded in 1702, had been ‘one of H.M. principal tacksmen for the\r\nCustoms and Excise,’ a pre-Union appointment, and it is possible that\r\nthe son succeeded to his father’s office or to some of its perquisites.\r\nSir John was M.P. for Renfrewshire 1708-10; for Clackmannanshire\r\n1722-27; and again for Renfrewshire 1727-34. He married Margaret, d. of\r\nSir Hew Dalrymple of North Berwick 1700, and died 1752.\r\n\r\n[590] Letter i. p. 379.\r\n\r\n[591] Brigadier-General Thomas Fowke was the officer left by Cope in\r\ncommand of the cavalry stationed at Stirling and Edinburgh when he\r\nwent on his march to the Highlands. Fowke fled with the cavalry on\r\nthe approach of the Jacobite army, and joined Cope at Dunbar. He was\r\npresent, second in command, at Prestonpans. His conduct, along with\r\nthat of Cope and Colonel Peregrine Lascelles, was investigated by a\r\nmilitary court of inquiry, presided over by Field-Marshal Wade in 1746.\r\nAll were acquitted.\r\n\r\n[592] I have failed to find this narrative, but it matters little, as\r\nall that Grossett had to say was probably given in his evidence at\r\nthe trial of Lord Provost Stewart, an account of which was printed in\r\nEdinburgh, 1747. It is accessible in public libraries.\r\n\r\n[593] See _ante_, p. 127.\r\n\r\n[594] This refers to the capture of Charles Spalding of Whitefield,\r\nStrathardle in Atholl, a captain in the Atholl brigade. He was sent\r\nfrom Moffat on 7th November by William, (Jacobite) Duke of Atholl,\r\nto Perthshire with despatches, and carried a large number of private\r\nletters, which are preserved in the Record Office. He was made prisoner\r\nnear Kilsyth. There is no mention of Grossett’s presence in the\r\njournals of the day, the credit of the capture being given to Brown,\r\nthe factor of Campbell of Shawfield. (_Chron. Atholl and Tullibardine_,\r\niii. 86; _Scots Mag._, vii. 540.) Spalding was tried for his life at\r\nCarlisle the following October and acquitted.\r\n\r\n[595] The Lord Justice-Clerk had retired to Berwick when the Jacobite\r\narmy occupied Edinburgh. That army left Edinburgh for good on 1st\r\nNovember, but the Justice-Clerk and the officers of State did not\r\nreturn until the 13th.\r\n\r\n[596] Lieut.-Gen. Roger Handasyde superseded Lieut.-Gen. Guest as\r\nCommander-in-Chief in Scotland on his arrival in Edinburgh on 14th\r\nNovember, and held that office until December 5th, when he returned\r\nto England. Guest again acted as Commander-in-Chief until relieved by\r\nLieut.-General Hawley, who arrived in Edinburgh on 6th January 1746.\r\n\r\nThe two infantry regiments that accompanied Handasyde were Price’s\r\n(14th) and Ligonier’s (48th). They remained at Edinburgh until\r\nDecember, but after the landing at Montrose of Lord John Drummond with\r\nthe French Auxiliaries (22nd November), it was felt necessary to guard\r\nthe passage of the Forth with a stronger force, and the Edinburgh\r\ngarrison was sent to Stirling, Price’s on 6th December and Ligonier’s\r\non the 9th, where they were joined by the Glasgow and the Paisley\r\nmilitia. The cavalry were also sent to the neighbourhood of Stirling,\r\nand Edinburgh was left with no defence but some volunteers and\r\nafterwards by an Edinburgh regiment enlisted for three months’ service,\r\nof which Lord Home was commandant.\r\n\r\n[597] Letters ii.-iv. pp. 379-382.\r\n\r\n[598] Letter v. p. 383.\r\n\r\n[599] Letter viii. p. 385.\r\n\r\n[600] Letter ix. p. 386.\r\n\r\n[601] Letter x. p. 387.\r\n\r\n[602] The Glasgow regiment was then five hundred strong. It was\r\ncommanded by the Earl of Home, who was also colonel of the Edinburgh\r\nregiment. There were about a hundred and sixty men of the Paisley\r\nregiment, of which the Earl of Glencairn was colonel. (_Scots Mag._,\r\nviii. 30.)\r\n\r\n[603] Grossett’s account gives the erroneous impression that the\r\ninfantry was moved to Edinburgh on account of its desertion by the\r\ncavalry. According to the _Caledonian Mercury_ and the _Scots Mag._,\r\nthe cavalry and the main body of the regular infantry came in together\r\nby forced marches from Stirling on the morning of the 24th, ‘men and\r\nhorses extremely fatigued.’ The west country militia arrived later, by\r\nship from Bo’ness, the intention originally being to send them on to\r\none of the East Lothian or Berwickshire ports (see Lord Justice-Clerk’s\r\nletter, xvii. p. 390 _post_). It was decided, however, not to abandon\r\nEdinburgh, so the infantry was kept in the town, but ‘all the dragoons\r\nwere marched eastward’; the text here locates Haddington as their\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\n[604] Letters xii.-xviii. pp. 388, 391.\r\n\r\n[605] Letter xiii. p. 388.\r\n\r\n[606] The _Milford_, on 28th November, captured off Montrose the _Louis\r\nXV._, one of Lord John Drummond’s transports; eighteen officers and\r\none hundred and sixty men were made prisoners, and a large quantity of\r\narms and military stores were taken. The prisoners were confined in\r\nEdinburgh Castle until 26th December, when they were sent to Berwick.\r\n\r\n[607] Letter xix. p. 391.\r\n\r\n[608] Henry C. Hawley; b. _c._ 1679, d. 1757. Served at Almanza, where\r\nhe was taken prisoner; Sheriffmuir, where he was wounded; Dettingen\r\nand Fontenoy; C.-in-C. at Falkirk; commanded the cavalry at Culloden.\r\nExecrated by the Jacobites, and detested by his own soldiers, who\r\ndubbed him for his cruelty the Lord Chief-Justice and hangman. He\r\narrived in Edinburgh on January 6th, 1746.\r\n\r\n[609] In the ‘Narrative’ this sentence begins ‘Mr. Grossett having\r\nreceived certain intelligence which he communicated to Lord Justice\r\nClarke that the rebells....’\r\n\r\n[610] The ‘Narrative’ says ‘one hundred.’ This agrees with Maxwell\r\nof Kirkconnell ‘not above a hundred,’ but the number was continually\r\nincreasing.\r\n\r\n[611] Lieut.-colonel of Blakeney’s regiment (27th, now the Royal\r\nInniskilling Fusiliers).\r\n\r\n[612] Letter xx. p. 392.\r\n\r\n[613] Letters xxi., xxii. pp. 392, 393.\r\n\r\n[614] William Blakeney, an Irishman, born in Co. Limerick 1672;\r\nbrigadier-general 1741, major-general 1744, and appointed\r\nlieut.-governor of Stirling Castle in that year. The office was a\r\nsinecure in time of peace. When Cope left Edinburgh for his highland\r\nmarch, Blakeney posted down to Scotland and took command at Stirling\r\nCastle on 27th August. When summoned to surrender the Castle to Prince\r\nCharles in January, before and again after the battle of Falkirk, he\r\nreplied that he had always been looked upon as a man of honour and the\r\nrebels should find he would die so. His successful defence of Stirling\r\nwas rewarded by promotion to lieut.-general and the command of Minorca,\r\nwhich he held for ten years. His defence of Minorca in 1756 against an\r\noverwhelming French force won the admiration of Europe. For seventy\r\ndays this old man of eighty-four held out and never went to bed. On\r\ncapitulation the garrison was allowed to go free. Blakeney received an\r\nIrish peerage for his defence of Minorca about the time that Admiral\r\nByng was executed for its abandonment.\r\n\r\n[615] John Huske, 1692-1761, colonel of the 23rd (Royal Welsh\r\nFusiliers); was second in command at Falkirk, and commanded the second\r\nline at Culloden. Major-general 1743; general 1756. He was second in\r\ncommand to Blakeney at Minorca in 1756.\r\n\r\nHuske’s division on their march consisted of four regiments of\r\ninfantry of the line, and the Glasgow regiment, with Ligonier’s (late\r\nGardiner’s) and Hamilton’s dragoons (now 13th and 14th Hussars).\r\n\r\n[616] This is very misleading. Lord George Murray’s scheme was to wait\r\ntill the Government troops came up, and tempt them over the bridge:\r\nwhen half had crossed he intended to turn and cut them off. Lord\r\nElcho had kept the enemy in sight all the time, and records that the\r\nJacobites retired ‘in such order that the dragoons never offered to\r\nattack them’; moreover, before the highlanders ‘had passed the bridge\r\nthe dragoons, who were in front of the regulars, drew up close by the\r\nbridge and very abusive language passed betwixt both sides.’\r\n\r\nEven the picturesque touch of the substituted dinner must go. Lord\r\nGeorge particularly mentions both in a private letter to his wife and\r\nin his historical letter to Hamilton of Bangour that they had dined at\r\nLinlithgow, and the journals of the day state that the affair occurred\r\nabout 4 o’clock. Maxwell of Kirkconnell considers that if the dragoons\r\nhad been very enterprising they might have cut off Lord George’s rear.\r\n(Elcho, _Affairs of Scotland_, p. 370; _Jac. Mem._, p. 79; _Chron. Ath.\r\nand Tullib._, iii. 141; Kirkconnell’s _Narrative_, p. 98.)\r\n\r\n[617] This is meant to be an account of the battle of Falkirk.\r\n\r\n[618] The Argyllshire highlanders had joined Huske at Falkirk on\r\nJanuary 16th, and were present at the battle the following day. Their\r\ncolonel was John Campbell, younger, of Mamore (1723-1806). In 1745 he\r\nwas lieut.-colonel of the 54th Regiment, but he commanded the Argyll\r\nHighlanders (militia) throughout the Scottish campaign, and was present\r\nat Falkirk and Culloden. He succeeded his father (see _ante_, p. 259)\r\nas 5th Duke of Argyll, 1770. He is best known to fame as the husband of\r\nthe beautiful Elizabeth Gunning, widow of the 6th Duke of Hamilton, and\r\nas the host of Dr. Johnson and Boswell at Inverary in 1773.\r\n\r\n[619] At Prestonpans (21st September) seventy-seven officers were taken\r\nprisoners. Some of these were allowed entire freedom on parole, but\r\na large portion of them had been interned in Perthshire: they were\r\nkindly treated, and had given their parole. In December a considerable\r\nnumber had been removed to Glamis Castle, in Forfarshire, and to Cupar,\r\nLeslie, Pitfirran, Culross, and St. Andrews in Fife. They were living\r\nquietly in these places when about the second week in January their\r\nretreats were raided and they ‘were forcibly hurried off by a great\r\nnumber of people in arms and disguised, whom they could not resist, and\r\ncarried by the same violence to Edinburgh.’ (_Scots Mag._, viii. 43.)\r\nThirty-one officers arrived at Edinburgh on 19th January, and Grossett\r\nwas sent next day to recover those mentioned in the text.\r\n\r\n[620] The Duke of Cumberland arrived in Edinburgh on 30th January.\r\n\r\n[621] Not identified.\r\n\r\n[622] Letter xxv. p. 394.\r\n\r\n[623] This officer may have been the second major of the 3rd (Scots)\r\nGuards, the only regimental officer of the name who held the rank of\r\ncolonel at this time.\r\n\r\n[624] Letter xxviii. p. 395.\r\n\r\n[625] Not identified.\r\n\r\n[626] Letter xxix. p. 395.\r\n\r\n[627] Should be Bligh’s regiment, the 20th, now the Lancashire\r\nFusiliers.\r\n\r\n[628] Letter xxx. p. 396.\r\n\r\n[629] Letter xxxi. p. 396.\r\n\r\n[630] William, 8th earl, suc. 1720. In 1745 he was a captain in the 3rd\r\n(Scots) Guards: he served on Cope’s staff at Prestonpans; commanded the\r\nGlasgow (volunteer or militia) regiment at Falkirk; was also colonel of\r\nthe Edinburgh regiment. In 1757 he was appointed Governor of Gibraltar,\r\nwhere he died in 1761, being then a lieut.-general.\r\n\r\n[631] Letter xxxiii. p. 398.\r\n\r\n[632] This is that Thomas Smith who, in 1728, for an act of consummate\r\naudacity acquired vast fame, became for a while the darling of the\r\nBritish nation, and in the Navy received the nickname of ‘Tom of Ten\r\nThousand.’ Although only junior lieut. of H.M.S. _Gosport_, while in\r\ntemporary command he forced the French corvette _Gironde_ to lower her\r\ntopsail as a salute to the British flag when passing out of Plymouth\r\nSound. For this exploit he was summarily dismissed the service on\r\nthe complaint of the French ambassador, but, according to tradition,\r\nwas reinstated the following day with the rank of post-captain\r\n(see Thackeray’s _Roundabout Papers_, No. 4, ‘On Some Late Great\r\nVictories’). Modern investigation has somewhat qualified the dramatic\r\nstory of the reinstatement, but not of the initial act. Smith was naval\r\ncommander-in-chief in Scotland from February 1746 to January 1747 when\r\nhe became rear-Admiral; in 1757, Admiral of the Blue. He presided at\r\nthe court-martial which condemned Admiral Byng. He died 1761.\r\n\r\nTo those interested in Jacobite history his memory should ever be\r\ncherished as the benignant guardian, if jailer, of Flora Macdonald.\r\nWhen Flora was first made prisoner in Skye in the second week of July,\r\nshe was taken on board the ship of the merciless Captain Ferguson\r\n(_ante_, p. 244), in which she was detained for three weeks. Luckily\r\nfor her, General Campbell was also on board and treated Flora with\r\ngreat kindness. The general handed her over to Commodore Smith, with\r\nwhom she remained a prisoner until her arrival in London in the\r\nmiddle of November, a period of three and a half months. Home, in his\r\n_History_, says that ‘this most worthy gentleman treated Flora not\r\nas a stranger, nor a prisoner, but with the affection of a parent.’\r\nBishop Forbes tells the same story: he ‘behaved like a father to her,\r\nand tendered her many good advices as to her behaviour in her ticklish\r\nsituation.’ Smith permitted Flora to go ashore in Skye to see her\r\nmother. When lying in Leith roads he presented her with a handsome\r\nsuit of riding clothes and other garments, as well as an outfit for a\r\nHighland maid who had hurriedly left Skye to accompany the lady in her\r\ncaptivity.\r\n\r\n[633] Guild Hall Relief Fund.

Vaughan: London, 1906.\r\n\r\n[645] I am indebted to Miss Nairne, Salisbury, for this translation.\r\n\r\n[646] These lists make no pretence to completeness. They are extracted\r\nfrom a manuscript Jacobite army list which I have been compiling\r\nfor many years. In it I have noted down the name of every gentleman\r\nproperly authenticated that I have come across when studying the\r\nhistory of the period.\r\n\r\n[647] Clanranald, Boisdale, Glengarry, and Bishop Hugh Macdonald did\r\nnot rise in arms, but were all imprisoned for being concerned in the\r\nRising.\r\n\r\n[648] Interesting information on the raising of Fairburn’s men is\r\ngiven by the French envoy, writing to the French Foreign Minister:\r\nLady Mackintosh, he says, ‘a bien été imitée par une autre fort\r\njolie personne de son âge, nommée Barbe Gourdon, femme de Mekensie\r\nde Ferbarn, le plus considérable des vassaux et des parens de milord\r\nSeaforth. Celle-cy n’a pas banni son mari; mais, malgré luy, elle a\r\nvendu ses diamants et sa vaisselle pour lever des hommes. Elle s’en a\r\nramassé cent ciquante des plus braves du païs, qu’elle a joint à ceux\r\nde miladi Seaforth, sous la conduite de son beau-frère.’\r\n\r\nThis ‘beau-frère’ may mean Kenneth, her husband’s brother, or it may\r\nmean Barisdale who was married to her husband’s sister. Young Lentron\r\nin the _List of Persons concerned in the Rebellion_ is termed a\r\nschoolboy. I find no mention of this Barbara Gordon in the Mackenzie\r\nclan history.\r\n\r\n[649] James Gordon, son of the laird of Glasterum, Banffshire.

Lord John Drummond,\r\nClanranald, and possibly Lady Clanranald (_née_ Macleod) were Roman\r\nCatholics.\r\n\r\n[650] Frederick of Hesse Cassel was the consort of Ulrica, sister and\r\nsuccessor of Charles XII. He was crowned King of Sweden 1720; died\r\n1751. His nephew, Frederick, Prince, afterwards Landgrave, of Hesse,\r\nmarried Princess Anne, daughter of George II., 1740: he brought Hessian\r\ntroops to Scotland in February 1746.\r\n\r\n[651] Alexander Gordon of Auchintoul (Banffshire). Entered the\r\nRussian service 1693; married the daughter of his kinsman, Patrick\r\nGordon of Achleuris, the celebrated General of Peter the Great. Was\r\na colonel at the battle of Narva (1700), where he was captured and\r\ndetained prisoner until Peter’s victory at Pultowa (1709). Rose to\r\nbe a Russian major-general. Joined Mar’s Rising, 1715, and was made\r\nlieutenant-general (October 1715); commander-in-chief (February 1716)\r\nof the Jacobite Army on Mar’s leaving Scotland. Was at Bordeaux, and\r\ntoo ill to join the attempt of 1719. Though living in Banffshire in\r\n1745, he felt too old to go ‘out.’ Died 1752. He wrote a _History of\r\nPeter the Great_, published after his death, in Aberdeen, 1755.\r\n\r\n[652] Captain Wm.

Captured in May in the Braes of Angus; tried\r\nfor his life, and in vain pleaded his Spanish commission; sentenced\r\nto death but reprieved; released in 1748; died a lieut.-col. in the\r\nSpanish service 1751. (Leishman, _A Son of Knox_, p. 20.) Ker wrote\r\nan account of the operations in the last two months of the campaign,\r\nprinted in _The Lyon_, i. 355.\r\n\r\n[658] This statement of Daniel’s is opposed to all reliable evidence,\r\nand the note in the Drummond Castle MS. is correct. The desire of his\r\nenemies was to throw the blame of the disaster on Lord George Murray.\r\nEven the Prince seems to have talked himself into a similar belief (see\r\n_post_, p. 240). The responsibility lay on Prince Charles himself, as\r\nis told in the Introduction.\r\n\r\n[659] Keppoch’s brother Donald, killed at Culloden.
